<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001093 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 06-23-13 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, MV, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 94  (06-23-03) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Donald A. Camp, Charge d\'Affaires, </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:   KILLING IN COLOMBO AREA </p><p>-           IRAQI CHARGE COMMENTS </p><p>-           IMPLEMENTING THE NON-SURRENDER ACCORDS </p><p>-           PRESS PLAY RE PM MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT </p><p>-           PRESS PLAY RE PA-LTTE MEETING </p><p>-           EXPORT LICENSE DELAY </p><p>-           CHARGE CAMP IS HERE </p><p> </p><p>KILLING IN COLOMBO AREA </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>1.  (C) We just received late word that a police officer </p><p>was gunned down in the greater Colombo area earlier today </p><p>(June 23).  After taking cyanide, the suspect was </p><p>arrested and is now in the hospital.  The inspector who </p><p>was killed, Sunil Thabrew, had reportedly been heavily </p><p>involved in investigating the numerous killings of </p><p>military informants of Tamil ethnicity that have taken </p><p>place in past weeks and months.  Given this link, </p><p>Thabrew\'s killing seems to be related to the recent spate </p><p>of killings of Tamil opponents of the LTTE that Mission </p><p>has been reporting on (see Colombo 1078, and previous). </p><p>The fact that a police officer has now been killed (with </p><p>the LTTE the apparent culprit) and that the killing took </p><p>place in the greater Colombo area will be seen by many as </p><p>an escalation in such violence.  The fact that the </p><p>inspector was Sinhalese also will not please the majority </p><p>community.  The Ops Center just called about the slaying </p><p>and we briefed them on what we knew.  We will be </p><p>providing more information on the incident tomorrow (June </p><p>24).  (POL/RSO) </p><p> </p><p>IRAQI CHARGE COMMENTS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>2.  (C) Please pass this information to NEA and DoD: </p><p>Polchief received a phone call on June 20 from Iraqi </p><p>Charge Wajdi Mardan Abbas requesting an immediate meeting </p><p>to discuss an "urgent" matter.  (Note:  Abbas had been </p><p>interviewed several times before by Ambassador Wills, DCM </p><p>and RSO, and other USG officials -- see previous </p><p>reporting.)  RSO met with Abbas late June 20. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Abbas had just returned from what he said were </p><p>two "very discouraging" weeks in Baghdad.  (Note:  He </p><p>stated that Amb. Bremer and the interim authority had </p><p>recalled all Iraqi COMs for Baghdad meetings.)  He </p><p>started his comments by incidentally complaining about </p><p>conditions in Baghdad:  lack of water; reliable power; </p><p>lawlessness and a sense of general instability, etc.  He </p><p>asserted that the coalition had already lost the </p><p>initiative in terms of winning hearts and minds...that </p><p>the mood of the people was becoming impatient with the </p><p>slow progress toward the return of essential services. </p><p>His real (and apparently to him -- "urgent") comments </p><p>dealt with what he said was Amb. Bremer\'s plan to close </p><p>32 of the current 64 Iraqi missions.  He complained that </p><p>the decision to close a mission should be an "Iraqi </p><p>Government" decision.  He asked, who would be responsible </p><p>for the diplomatic properties, equipment, documents and </p><p>consular services?  He opined that a decision to close </p><p>half the Iraqi Embassies worldwide would not be viewed </p><p>favorably in the Arab world.  Lastly, Abbas wanted to </p><p>ensure that this message was passed to Washington.  RSO </p><p>advised him that the message would be sent, and asked him </p><p>what he would do if he was ordered home?  Abbas said he </p><p>didn\'t know.  It was unlikely that he would go back to </p><p>Baghdad, as "...things are too unstable.  Maybe I\'ll </p><p>retire and go somewhere else."  (RSO/POL) </p><p> </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE NON-SURRENDER ACCORDS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>4.   (SBU) We received the e-mail with the draft entry </p><p>into force diplomatic notes for the non-surrender accords </p><p>put together by L (Jim Waller Joe Novak 06-20-03 class </p><p>e-mail).  We will be working on this matter with the GoRM </p><p>and the GSL in the next several days.  IMPORTANT -- </p><p>Please note that both the GoRM and the GSL have now told </p><p>us that they consider the agreements to be in force. </p><p>(Note:  For the Maldives, the agreement came into force </p><p>as an executive decree per President Gayoom\'s decision. </p><p>For Sri Lanka, the agreement came into force after the </p><p>Cabinet agreed on the matter.)  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>PRESS PLAY RE PM MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU) Just want to flag that there has been some </p><p>press play here in the past several days to the effect </p><p>that President Bush has agreed to meet PM Wickremesinghe </p><p>on the margins of UNGA this September.  The information </p><p>in the articles was not sourced.  When the leadership </p><p>gets back from London, we will warn them against any such </p><p>speculation.  (POL) </p><p>PRESS PLAY RE PA-LTTE MEETING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>6.  (SBU) There has also been some press play in the past </p><p>several days asserting that Tiger officials secretly met </p><p>with members of President Kumaratunga\'s People\'s Alliance </p><p>(PA) party in recent days.  The PA denies the stories, </p><p>but we just wanted to flag the reports.  If there was </p><p>such a meeting, by the way, it would -- if we recall </p><p>correctly --  be just about the first meeting the PA has </p><p>had with the Tigers since the advent of the peace </p><p>process.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>EXPORT LICENSE DELAY </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) An American company, FXC Corporation, has a </p><p>contract to supply the Sri Lankan Army with parachutes. </p><p>The export license application has been in the works for </p><p>over 8 months, and they\'re about to request a second </p><p>extension on their Letter of Credit.  Could you please </p><p>get in touch with the appropriate office and check on the </p><p>status of application number 866792, submitted over the </p><p>Internet on October 5, 2002?  Many thanks. (COMM) </p><p> </p><p>CHARGE CAMP IS HERE </p><p>------------------- </p><p>8.  (U) Don Camp arrived in Colombo very early this </p><p>morning and has assumed charge. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
