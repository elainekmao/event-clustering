<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 CARACAS 000404 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  02/05/09 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: CHAVEZ TAKES OFFICE, ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS, CONVOKES A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM, AND LAYS OUT HIS AGENDA </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS A. SHANNON, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASON:  1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  HUGO CHAVEZ WAS SWORN IN AS VENEZUELA\'S PRESIDENT ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 2, BEGINNING A THREE-DAY SERIES OF EVENTS CELEBRATING THE </p><p>END OF WHAT HE CALLED "AN OLD, CORRUPT ORDER" AND THE START OF </p><p>"VENEZUELA\'S RESURRECTION."  TAKING HIS OATH OF OFFICE ON A </p><p>"MORIBUND CONSTITUTION" WHICH HE PROMISED TO REPLACE QUICKLY WITH </p><p>A NEW "MAGNA CARTA," CHAVEZ CALLED ALL VENEZUELANS TO ACCOUNT FOR </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S "MORAL AND ETHICAL CRISIS" WHICH HAD LEFT A CORRUPT, </p><p>BANKRUPT GOVERNMENT AND A DIVIDED, ANTAGONISTIC SOCIETY IN WHICH </p><p>EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION LIVED IN POVERTY.  DECLARING HIS </p><p>OWN CULPABILITY AND ASKING FORGIVENESS FOR THE FAILED 1992 COUP </p><p>ATTEMPT, CHAVEZ SAID VENEZUELANS MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR </p><p>POLITICAL PAST, RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCES WHICH PROVOKED THE FAILED </p><p>COUPS ATTEMPTS, AND WORK TOGETHER TO "DEFUSE OUR SOCIAL TIME BOMB." </p><p>CHALLENGING THE CONGRESS TO "GET TO WORK," CHAVEZ BRUSHED ASIDE </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL BICKERING BY IMMEDIATELY ISSUING A DECREE CONVOKING </p><p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM--SETTING THE STAGE FOR A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY--AND ASKED THE CONGRESS FOR ENABLING </p><p>LEGISLATION TO ENACT EMERGENCY ECONOMIC MEASURES TO ADDRESS </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S FISCAL CRISIS.  HE UNDERSCORED HIS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS, INSISTING THAT HE WAS THE </p><p>"PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC CHANNEL" THROUGH WHICH VENEZUELA WOULD </p><p>ADDRESS ITS "SOCIAL EMERGENCY."  DECLARING, "WE HAVE NOTHING TO </p><p>FEAR FROM THE PEOPLE," HE SAID HIS PLAN FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY WAS TO "RE-LEGITIMIZE THE STATE" AND MAKE GOVERNMENT MORE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE AND PARTICIPATIVE.  ASSERTING, "I AM THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCE, NOT THE CAUSE" OF VENEZUELANS\' DEEP YEARNING FOR </p><p>POLITICAL CHANGE, CHAVEZ SAID HIS PROJECT IS A "PROJECT OF ALL </p><p>VENEZUELANS" AND THAT THE SUCCESS OF HIS GOVERNMENT WAS NECESSARY </p><p>FOR THE SURVIVAL OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN VENEZUELA. </p><p>ALTERNATELY DRAMATIC AND BOMBASTIC, WITH FLASHES OF POPULISM AND </p><p>AUTHORITARIANISM, CHAVEZ EMERGED FROM THIS THREE-DAY INAUGURAL </p><p>CELEBRATION WITH AN ELECTRIFIED POPULATION, AN ARTICULATED AND </p><p>ENVIGORATED AGENDA OF GOVERNMENT, AND HIS POLITICAL ADVERSARIES </p><p>REELING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S NEW PRESIDENT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) HUGO CHAVEZ WAS SWORN-IN AS VENEZUELA\'S PRESIDENT ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 2, NEARLY SEVEN YEARS TO THE DAY AFTER HE HAD TRIED AND </p><p>FAILED TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT OF THEN-PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES </p><p>PEREZ IN 1992. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE SWEARING IN CEREMONY--WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE SENATE </p><p>CHAMBER OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS, BUT WAS BROADCAST LIVE ON </p><p>NATIONAL TELEVISION AND CARRIED BY LOUDSPEAKER TO THOUSANDS OF RED- </p><p>BERETED SUPPORTERS RINGING THE CONGRESS--WAS THE BEGINNING OF A </p><p>THREE-DAY SERIES OF EVENTS AND CELEBRATIONS.  THESE INCLUDED THE </p><p>SWEARING IN OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT AT MIRAFLORES  (THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>PALACE), A WREATH-LAYING AT THE TOMB OF SIMON BOLIVAR, THE MILITARY </p><p>CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONY, A PUBLIC SPEECH BEFORE SEVERAL HUNDRED </p><p>THOUSAND SUPPORTERS AT THE CARACAS EQUIVALENT OF THE MALL (LOS </p><p>PROCERES), A STATE DINNER, AND A MILITARY PARADE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) OVER SIXTY COUNTRIES SENT DELEGATIONS TO THE INAUGURATION, </p><p>INCLUDING SIXTEEN HEADS OF STATES.  THE U.S. DELEGATION CONSISTED </p><p>OF: </p><p> </p><p>--  SECRETARY OF ENERGY BILL RICHARDSON </p><p>--  AMBASSADOR JOHN MAISTO </p><p> </p><p>--  AMBASSADOR PETER ROMERO, ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF WESTERN </p><p>HEMISPHERE AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>--  AMBASSADOR GABRIEL GUERRA MONDRAGON </p><p> </p><p>--  MARTIN CHAVEZ, FORMER MAYOR OF ALBERQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) SEPTELS REPORT MEETINGS U.S. DELEGATION HAD WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>PASTRANA OF COLOMBIA, MINISTER OF MINES AND ENERGY ALI RODRIGUEZ, </p><p>AND A LUNCH WITH CEOS OF VENEZUELA. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>THEMES OF CHAVEZ\' SPEECHES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) CHAVEZ SET THE TONE FOR THE INAUGURATION AND HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>SHORTLY AFTER HE ENTERED THE SENATE CHAMBER.  ON HIS WAY TO THE </p><p>DAIS, HE MARCHED PAST CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND THE DEMOCRATIC ACTION </p><p>PARTY\'S (AD) LEGISLATIVE LEADERS WITHOUT ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.  HIS </p><p>GREETING OF PRESIDENT CALDERA WAS POLITE BUT PERFUNCTORY.  THE </p><p>TIGHT, ALMOST PAINFULLY ATTENTIVE DECORUM OF THE SENATE WAS </p><p>IRRETRIEVABLY RUPTURED, HOWEVER, WHEN CHAVEZ TOOK HIS OATH OF </p><p>OFFICE.  AFTER BEING ASKED BY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE LUIS DAVILA </p><p>IF HE PROMISED TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS OF THE LAND, </p><p>CHAVEZ RESPONDED, "I SWEAR ON THIS MORIBUND CONSTITUTION," AND THEN </p><p>ANNOUNCED, HIS RIGHT HAND STILL HELD HIGH, THAT HE WOULD DO ALL IN </p><p>HIS POWER TO WRITE A NEW CONSTITUTION AND RETURN DEMOCRATIC </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA.  AN AUDIBLE GASP RIPPLED </p><p>THROUGH THE SENATE AT CHAVEZ\' DEPARTURE FROM PROTOCOL.  OUTSIDE THE </p><p>CONGRESS, THOUSANDS OF RED-BERETED CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS CHEERED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) IN THE SPEECH CHAVEZ GAVE IN THE SENATE FOLLOWING HIS </p><p>SWEARING IN, AND IN FOLLOW-ON SPEECHES HE GAVE AT THE SWEARING IN </p><p>OF HIS MINISTERS, THE PUBLIC SPEECH AT LOS PROCERES, AND IN REMARKS </p><p>AT THE STATE DINNER AND THE MILITARY PARADE, SEVERAL THEMES WERE </p><p>DOMINANT: </p><p> </p><p>--  ETHICAL AND MORAL CRISIS.  CHAVEZ BEGAN HIS SPEECH IN THE </p><p>SENATE WITH A HARSH CONDEMNATION OF VENEZUELAN POLITICAL SOCIETY </p><p>AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE VENEZUELAN STATE.  POINTING TO VENEZUELA\'S </p><p>BOUNTIFUL NATURAL RESOURCES, ITS RELATIVELY SMALL AND YOUNG </p><p>POPULATION, AND ITS ENORMOUS OIL WEALTH, HE WONDERED ALOUD HOW SUCH </p><p>A COUNTRY COULD BE FACING A FISCAL CRISIS, HOW SUCH A COUNTRY COULD </p><p>FIND EIGHTY PERCENT OF ITS POPULATION IN POVERTY, AND HOW SUCH A </p><p>COUNTRY COULD HAVE STREET CHILDREN, ILLITERACY, AND A COLLAPSING </p><p>PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  HE THEN FIXED BLAME FOR THIS SITUATION </p><p>ON PUBLIC CORRUPTION AND THE NARROW CLIENTELISM OF TRADITIONAL </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES.  HE ACCUSED VENEZUELAN ELITES OF DEBASING PUBLIC </p><p>LIFE, CREATING CORROSIVE CYNICISM, AND ESTRANGING CITIZENS FROM </p><p>THEIR STATE.  THE RESULT, HE DECLARED, WAS AN AMORAL INDIVIDUALISM </p><p>WHICH HAD CREATED A PROFOUND ETHICAL AND MORAL CRISIS.  ONLY BY </p><p>RECOGNIZING THIS CRISIS, AND ADDRESSING IT THROUGH CREATION OF A </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE AND PARTICIPATIVE STATE AND GOVERNMENT WHICH SERVED </p><p>THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE, COULD VENEZUELA HOPE TO REBUILD </p><p>ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>--  FORGIVENESS.  WHILE POINTING AN ACCUSATORY FINGER AT </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S TRADITIONAL POWER STRUCTURE, CHAVEZ REMINDED ALL </p><p>VENEZUELANS THAT THEY WERE SILENT ACCOMPLICES IN THE DEBASEMENT OF </p><p>THEIR DEMOCRACY.  HE INSISTED THAT NO ONE WAS FREE OF CULPABILITY. </p><p>TO UNDERSCORE THIS POINT, HE SAID THAT HE HIMSELF BORE BLAME FOR </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S DIFFICULTIES.  HE THEN STRUCK HIS BREAST THREE TIMES </p><p>AND SAID, "MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA."  HE CALLED ON ALL </p><p>VENEZUELANS TO FORGIVE EACH OTHER.  BUILDING ON THIS THEME DURING </p><p>HIS FEBRUARY 4 SPEECH AT THE MILITARY PARADE, CHAVEZ ASKED PARDON </p><p>FOR HIS ROLE IN THE 1992 COUP.  IN HIS SENATE SPEECH, HE DESCRIBED </p><p>THE 1992 COUP ATTEMPT AS AN "INEVITABLE" RESULT OF THE 1989 SOCIAL </p><p>UPRISING IN WHICH THE MILITARY HAD TO RESTORE ORDER AT THE COST OF </p><p>HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS, OF LIVES.  NEITHER JUSTIFYING NOR </p><p>GLORIFYING WHAT HAPPENED IN 1992, HE LINKED THE COUP TO A POLITICAL </p><p>ORDER WHICH HAD SET VENEZUELAN AGAINST VENEZUELAN.  THE COUP, HE </p><p>SAID, WAS EMBLEMATIC OF THE CRISIS OF THE STATE.  ONLY BY ACCEPTING </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTIONS TAKEN, AND BY SEEKING FORGIVENESS, COULD </p><p>VENEZUELA OVERCOME ITS CURRENT CRISIS.  HE REMINDED HIS LISTENERS </p><p>THAT ON FEBRUARY 4, 1992, WHEN HIS COUP ATTEMPT HAD FAILED, HE </p><p>SURRENDERED, ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE, AND </p><p>SERVED TWO YEARS IN PRISON AS PUNISHMENT.  HE SAID HIS OWN </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS SHOULD SERVE </p><p>AS AN EXAMPLE TO FUGITIVE BANKERS AND OTHERS ACCUSED OF CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>--  RECONCILIATION.  CHAVEZ SAID FORGIVENESS MUST LEAD TO </p><p>RECONCILIATION IF VENEZUELANS WERE TO WORK TOGETHER TO RECREATE </p><p>THEIR COUNTRY.  HE SAID HIS DECISION TO HOLD THE MILITARY PARADE ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 4, THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COUP ATTEMPT, WAS NOT AN EFFORT </p><p>TO GLORIFY THE EVENTS OF SEVEN YEARS AGO.  ON THE CONTRARY, HE SAID </p><p>IT WAS AN EFFORT TO RECONCILE AN INSTITUTION AND A COUNTRY WHICH </p><p>HAD BEEN RENT BY THE EVENTS OF FEBRUARY 4.  DURING THE WREATH </p><p>LAYING CEREMONY AT BOLIVAR\'S TOMB, HE LAID ONE WREATH FOR "ALL THE </p><p>SOLDIERS WHO DIED ON FEBRUARY 4."  HE ANNOUNCED IN THE SENATE, AS </p><p>EVIDENCE OF RECONCILIATION, HIS INTENTION TO REACTIVATE THE </p><p>PARATROOPER BATTALIONS THAT HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE COUP ATTEMPT. </p><p>HE DID SO AT THE MILITARY PARADE, AND ALSO OFFERED TO REINSTATE IN </p><p>THE ARMED FORCES THOSE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WHO HAD BEEN COURT </p><p>MARTIALED FOLLOWING THE COUP. </p><p> </p><p>--  RESURRECTION.  CHAVEZ PREDICTED THAT VENEZUELA AND ITS PEOPLE </p><p>WOULD BE "RESURRECTED" THROUGH FORGIVENESS AND RECONCILIATION. </p><p>THIS RESURRECTION WOULD BE MANIFESTED THROUGH THE COMMON EFFORT OF </p><p>VENEZUELANS TO FACE THEIR COUNTRY\'S DESPERATE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>CONDITION.  HE CRITICIZED THOSE WHO CALLED FOR HIM TO CREATE </p><p>CONSENSUS AROUND HIS POLITICAL AGENDA, ACCUSING THEM OF USING </p><p>"CONSENSUS" TO SOW DIVISION.  HE ANNOUNCED, "I AM NOT SEEKING </p><p>CONSENSUS, I AM SEEKING UNITY."   HE INSISTED THAT THE VENEZUELAN </p><p>PEOPLE HAD SPOKEN LOUDLY AND CLEARLY IN THE DECEMBER ELECTIONS. </p><p>THEY WANTED DRAMATIC, SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL CHANGE, AND THEY WOULD </p><p>HOLD THEIR LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR IMPLEMENTING OR NOT IMPLEMENTING </p><p>CHANGE.   IN THIS REGARD, RESURRECTION WAS LIKE THE REAWAKENING OF </p><p>A GIANT--THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE--WHICH WOULD TOLERATE NO APPEAL TO </p><p>"LEGALISM" OR "COMMON POLITICAL PRACTICE" TO DELAY NECESSARY </p><p>REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>--  DEMOCRACY.  CHAVEZ ANNOUNCED IN THE SENATE, "I AM THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCE, NOT THE CAUSE" OF THE PEOPLE\'S YEARNING FOR CHANGE. HE </p><p>DECLARED HIMSELF THE VICTIM OF A DARK AND UGLY CAMPAIGN TO PAINT </p><p>HIM AS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.  HE SAID THE REAL ENEMIES WERE HIS </p><p>ACCUSERS, WHOSE CYNICISM AND CORRUPTION HAD BLINDED THEM TO THE </p><p>SUFFERING OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF VENEZUELANS.  HE ASSERTED THAT </p><p>HIS "POLITICAL PROJECT" WAS TO "RELEGITIMIZE THE STATE" AND TO "RE- </p><p>FOUND" DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS SO THAT THEY HAD THE CONFIDENCE OF </p><p>THE PEOPLE.  HE ARGUED THAT HIS PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>WOULD BE THE CHANNEL THROUGH WHICH THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE RE- </p><p>INSERTED THEMSELVES INTO POLITICAL DEBATE.  ATTACKING THOSE WHO </p><p>OPPOSED THE PROPOSAL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, HE SAID, </p><p>"WHAT DO WE HAVE TO FEAR FROM THE PEOPLE?"  HE POINTED TO THE </p><p>DECEMBER 6 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AS EVIDENCE OF THE POPULAR DEMAND </p><p>FOR CHANGE, AND NOTED, "WE CANNOT FAIL THE PEOPLE." HE ASSERTED </p><p>THAT HE HAD OPENED A "PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC CHANNEL" FOR CHANGE, AND </p><p>THAT ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN THE WELL-BEING OF DEMOCRACY SHOULD </p><p>WORK TO KEEP THAT CHANNEL OPEN.  IF WE FAIL, CHAVEZ SAID, "THEN </p><p>DEMOCRACY WILL FAIL."  CHAVEZ SAID THAT HE HAD TAKEN OFFICE TO MAKE </p><p>SURE THAT THE EVENTS OF 1989 AND 1992 NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN.  CHAVEZ </p><p>REMINDED HIS LISTENERS THAT, DURING THE CALDERA GOVERNMENT, </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES HAD BEEN SUSPENDED TEMPORARILY DURING THE </p><p>FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 1993, AND HAD REMAINED SUSPENDED IN THE </p><p>MILITARY THEATERS OF OPERATION ALONG THE COLOMBIAN FRONTIER.  HE </p><p>SAID, "I HAVE NOT TAKEN OFFICE TO SUSPEND GUARANTEES, BUT TO GIVE </p><p>THESE GUARANTEES NEW LIFE AND TO EXTEND THEM TO ALL THE PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>WORK AGENDA </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  CHAVEZ USED THE THEMATIC ASPECTS OF HIS SPEECHES TO BUILD </p><p>A BASE FOR HIS WORK AGENDA, WHICH WE LAID OUT CLEARLY: </p><p> </p><p>--   CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  CHAVEZ SAID THE PRIMARY POLITICAL </p><p>PROJECT OF HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  HE </p><p>NOTED THAT OUTRIGHT OPPOSITION TO THE ASSEMBLY HAD NEARLY </p><p>DISAPPEARED SINCE HIS ELECTION, AN IMPLICIT RECOGNITION THAT THE </p><p>DECEMBER 6 VOTE WAS ALSO A VOTE IN FAVOR OF CHAVEZ\' PROPOSED </p><p>"CONSTITUYENTE."  CHAVEZ NOTED THAT CONGRESS, THROUGH THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT DECISION WHICH HAD OPENED THE WAY FOR THE REFERENDUM ON THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY, HAD PROPOSED TO CONVOKE THE ASSEMBLY ITSELF.  CHAVEZ </p><p>WELCOMED CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE ASSEMBLY, BUT SAID THE </p><p>CONGRESS WAS WASTING ITS TIME AND ENERGY ON A POLITICAL ISSUE WHICH </p><p>THE DECEMBER ELECTIONS HAD DECIDED.  HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD </p><p>ISSUE A DECREE FEBRUARY 2 CONVOKING THE REFERENDUM, WHICH HE DID </p><p>DURING HIS FIRST CABINET MEETING IMMEDIATELY AFTER  HIS </p><p>INAUGURATION.  CHAVEZ INSISTED THIS SURPRISE MOVE, WHICH LEFT MANY </p><p>IN THE SENATE CHAMBER STUNNED, WAS NECESSARY TO GET THE CONGRESS TO </p><p>FOCUS ON ITS REAL WORK--THE SECOND PART OF CHAVEZ\'S AGENDA--PASSING </p><p>AN ENABLING LAW WHICH WOULD PERMIT CHAVEZ TO TAKE EMERGENCY </p><p>ECONOMIC MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>--  ECONOMIC REFORM.  CHAVEZ TOLD THE CONGRESS TO "GET TO WORK" AND </p><p>PASS AN ENABLING LAW WHICH WOULD ALLOW HIM TO ENACT A VARIETY OF </p><p>ECONOMIC MEASURES TO ADDRESS VENEZUELA\'S FISCAL CRISIS.  HE SAID </p><p>THIS CRISIS REQUIRED IMMEDIATE ACTION, AND COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE </p><p>POLITICAL DEBATE AROUND THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY TO RUN ITS </p><p>COURSE.  CHAVEZ SAID THAT HE WANTED SPECIAL POWERS TO DECREE A </p><p>VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT)--TO REPLACE THE CURRENT SALES TAX--AND A </p><p>FINANCIAL SERVICES TAX, AND TO INSTITUTE CUSTOMS AND TARIFF REFORM. </p><p>THESE MEASURES, ALONG WITH OTHERS, WOULD PERMIT THE GOV TO INCREASE </p><p>ITS REVENUES AND BEGIN TO CLOSE A LARGE AND HAUNTING FISCAL GAP. </p><p>CHAVEZ SAID EVEN WITH ENHANCED REVENUES VENEZUELA WOULD NOT BE ABLE </p><p>TO PAY ITS DEBT, AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED, WITHOUT GUTTING MUCH </p><p>NEEDED SOCIAL PROGRAMS.  HE SAID THE GOV WOULD NEVER WALK AWAY FROM </p><p>ITS FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS, BUT SAID HE WOULD SEEK RESTRUCTURING OF </p><p>DEBT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  FINALLY, CHAVEZ SAID HE INTENDED TO MAKE </p><p>VENEZUELA INVESTOR FRIENDLY BY MAINTAINING POLICY CONTINUITY, AND </p><p>BY ENDING CORRUPTION AND JUDICIAL INSECURITY.  CHAVEZ URGED </p><p>VENEZUELAN INVESTORS TO LEAD THE WAY FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS, CALLING </p><p>ON THEM TO BRING BACK TO VENEZUELA THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOW </p><p>DEPOSITED OFFSHORE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S THREE-DAY INAUGURAL CELEBRATION WAS DRAMATIC.  HIS </p><p>ENERGY, AND WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK ENDLESSLY (BY THE END OF THE FIRST </p><p>DAY OF THE CELEBRATION--FEBRUARY 2--CHAVEZ HAD SPOKEN PUBLICLY SIX </p><p>TIMES FOR A TOTAL OF MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS), WAS IN MARKED CONTRAST </p><p>TO THE AGED PRESIDENT CALDERA.  NOT SINCE CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ\'S </p><p>1989 INAUGURATION HAD VENEZUELANS SEEN A PRESIDENT WITH SUCH A </p><p>COMMANDING PRESENCE.  BUT CHAVEZ\'S INAUGURATION WAS UNIQUE IN </p><p>SEVERAL WAYS.  FIRST, IT WAS A POPULAR CELEBRATION.  THE CROWDS </p><p>MASSED AROUND THE CONGRESS, AND THE CROWDS WHICH AWAITED CHAVEZ AT </p><p>LOS PROCERES FOR HIS PUBLIC SPEECH, OFFERED LARGE AND VOCIFEROUS </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT CHAVEZ IS A POLITICAL CELEBRITY WHOSE PERSONA AND </p><p>MESSAGE RESONATE DEEPLY AMONG THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE.  SECOND, </p><p>CHAVEZ\'S CALL FOR FORGIVENESS AND HIS CHALLENGE TO VENEZUELANS TO </p><p>IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND TO GET TO WORK WAS INNOVATIVE POLITICAL </p><p>RHETORIC TO WHICH ALL VENEZUELANS RESPONDED.   IT MARKED CHAVEZ AS </p><p>DIFFERENT.  AS ONE SPECTATOR AT THE SENATE SPEECH TOLD US, "I CAN </p><p>NEVER REMEMBER A VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT ASKING FORGIVENESS FOR </p><p>ANYTHING.  IN A SINGLE SPEECH CHAVEZ HAS SET HIMSELF APART FROM </p><p>EVERY PRESIDENT WHO CAME BEFORE HIM."  FINALLY, THERE WAS </p><p>SUBSTANCE.  CHAVEZ LEFT NO DOUBT ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF HIS </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  HIS TWO-PART AGENDA, AND THE DETERMINATION WITH </p><p>WHICH HE LAID IT OUT, LEFT LITTLE DOUBT THAT ANY ONE WHO OPPOSED </p><p>HIM SHOULD BE READY TO FIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S INAUGURATION ALSO RAISED CONCERNS.  THE FLASHES </p><p>OF POPULISM IN HIS SPEECH, HIS MOVEMENT FROM HUMILITY TO PRIDEFUL </p><p>PURPOSE, AND THE AUTHORITARIAN THREAT WHICH LURKED BEHIND HIS TOUGH </p><p>POLICY STATEMENTS WERE CONSIDERED, BY THE TRADITIONAL POLITICIANS, </p><p>TO BE A PORTENT OF VERY TOUGH TIMES AHEAD.  THOSE ACCUSTOMED TO THE </p><p>STYLIZED POLITICAL RHETORIC AND "YOU SCRATCH MY BACK, I\'LL SCRATCH </p><p>YOURS" CONDUCT OF PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS WERE UNPREPARED FOR CHAVEZ\'S </p><p>FORCEFUL BREAK WITH PAST PRACTICE.  THESE ASPECTS BEAR WATCHING, </p><p>BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE CAN SAY THAT CHAVEZ\'S INAUGURATION HAS LEFT </p><p>LITTLE DOUBT ABOUT WHO IS PRESIDENT, ELECTRIFIED VENEZUELANS, AND </p><p>DEALT A BLOW TO THE SOLAR PLEXUS OF HIS ADVERSARIES, LEAVING THEM, </p><p>FOR THE MOMENT, GASPING AND BENT OVER.  MEANWHILE, CHAVEZ, AWARE </p><p>THAT HE MUST CAPITALIZE ON HIS MOMENTUM, IS PUTTING IN EIGHTEEN </p><p>HOUR DAYS WORKING ON CONSTITUTIONAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM AND MOLDING </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
