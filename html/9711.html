<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001413 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, SA/RA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PREL, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MAOISTS SET JULY 31 DEADLINE FOR POSSIBLE </p><p>END TO CEASE-FIRE </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1388 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On July 25, Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa\'s </p><p>government replied to the Maoist letter setting </p><p>pre-conditions for the resumption of peace talks (reftel). </p><p>In its response, the Government of Nepal (GON) reaffirmed its </p><p>commitment to the peace talks, but stated it would not </p><p>concede to Maoist demands without first initiating the third </p><p>round of negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 27, the insurgents responded to the GON in an </p><p>8-page letter addressed to the negotiating team and signed by </p><p>Maoist political leader Babarum Bhattarai.  The letter, which </p><p>has not yet been made public, but which we expect soon will, </p><p>demands that the GON implement its pre-conditions (reported </p><p>reftel) by July 31 or face a break-down in the cease-fire. </p><p>The final page of the letter summarizes the Maoist ultimatum </p><p>and is provided below in rough translation: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>Maoists have requested the government fulfill all the </p><p>decisions (mentioned below) made during the first and second </p><p>round of talks by July 31, 2003, Thursday to show the </p><p>government\'s commitment towards the cease-fire.  If these </p><p>pre-requisites for dialogue are fulfilled by then, then the </p><p>Maoists would come for the third round of talks.  If not, the </p><p>Maoists will conclude that the government has unilaterally </p><p>dissolved the cease-fire and the dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>-- Implement the decision made during the second round of </p><p>talks to limit the activities of the Royal Army within 5 </p><p>kilometers of the barracks, release the central level </p><p>prisoners of war and publicize the whereabouts of the missing. </p><p> </p><p>-- In the new round of talks, the King should involve himself </p><p>in the dialogue or give full authority to the formal dialogue </p><p>team to make agreement on necessary subjects including the </p><p>progressive political solution and have the determined </p><p>authority to follow the agreements. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Royal Nepal Army should publicize its determination to </p><p>follow the code of conduct and the decisions made during all </p><p>rounds of talks. </p><p> </p><p>-- Abandon the anti-terrorist treaty signed recently with </p><p>America for five years and throw out all the American </p><p>military advisors and specialists from the country. </p><p> </p><p>-- Publicize the progressive agenda of the old regime. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment.  The Maoist response to last week\'s letter </p><p>from Prime Minister Thapa\'s negotiating team came </p><p>unexpectedly fast, suggesting that the Maoist leadership had </p><p>decided already to break the cease-fire and attempt to </p><p>deflect responsibility for the failure of the talks onto the </p><p>GON.  There is virtual unanimity among non-Maoist spokesmen </p><p>for political and civil society that the GON will not and </p><p>should not meet the insurgents\' unrealistic pre-conditions </p><p>for resumption of the peace talks.  Post will seek further </p><p>information from government sources and hold an Emergency </p><p>Action Committee in anticipation of renewed violence.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
