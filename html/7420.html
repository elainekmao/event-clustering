<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002255 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, EAID, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: ROYAL JORDANIAN INTEREST IN IRAQ CIVIL </p><p>AVIATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Amman 1251 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ) indicates </p><p>its availability to help Iraqi Airways or a successor Iraqi </p><p>airline begin operations as quickly as possible.  RJ, which </p><p>has long experience in Iraq, is ready to operate flights on </p><p>behalf of Iraqi Airways and/or provide technical, training </p><p>and any other assistance, possibility in tandem with the </p><p>Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority.  Post is not aware of </p><p>USG planning for civil aviation operations in Iraq, but RJ\'s </p><p>offer sounds like it has some advantages.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Royal Jordanian  Airlines (RJ) CEO Samer Majali </p><p>called on Ambassador Gnehm April 10 to reiterate his </p><p>thoughts about how RJ could be helpful in getting Iraqi </p><p>civil aviation restarted as early as possible (ref).  Majali </p><p>thought having Iraqi Airways in the air quickly would send </p><p>an important signal of normalcy to Iraqis and to the world, </p><p>but noted that IA has been essentially cut off from the </p><p>international aviation community for well over a decade. </p><p>Its fleet is not airworthy (the four jets on the ground in </p><p>Amman should be junked) and its personnel are no longer </p><p>qualified.  Royal Jordanian has long experience operating </p><p>into Iraq and knows its three international airports </p><p>(Baghdad, Mosul, and Basra) and the domestic airports well. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Majali said that RJ would be ready immediately to </p><p>operate "wet leases" (both crew and aircraft) on behalf of </p><p>IA.   An arrangement could include repainting RJ aircraft in </p><p>the colors of IA or a successor airline.  RJ would be </p><p>pleased to discuss any other arrangements.  RJ could provide </p><p>crew, maintenance, marketing support and help train new </p><p>Iraqi IA staff and bring old staff up to date.  Furthermore, </p><p>Majali thought that Jordan\'s Civil Aviation Authority would </p><p>similarly be ready to provide support for Iraqi air traffic </p><p>control, aviation security, ground handling and other </p><p>regulatory functions and operations. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment:  We do not know what Washington\'s </p><p>thinking has been about Iraqi Airways or civil aviation in </p><p>Iraq.  From our vantage point, Majali\'s ideas seem to make a </p><p>lot of sense.  RJ has the familiarity, expertise and extra </p><p>capacity to move in quickly and -- with its direct service </p><p>to the U.S. -- operates at the highest international safety </p><p>and security standards.  Its staff is entirely Arabic </p><p>speaking and able to interact smoothly with Iraqi </p><p>counterparts (which may not be the case for other Arab </p><p>airlines).  Most also speak excellent English.  The </p><p>Jordanian CAA is similarly professional and would be </p><p>excellent, bilingual counterparts for U.S. and Iraqi </p><p>personnel in Iraq.  The CAA also runs a training academy and </p><p>ICAO regional aviation security-training program in Amman </p><p>that currently offers state of the art training to airlines </p><p>and regulators from throughout the Arab world.  This would </p><p>also seem to be a logical opportunity to train Iraqis. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
