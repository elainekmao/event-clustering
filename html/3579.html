<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001573 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CE, Elections </p><p>SUBJECT:  Amendment limiting President\'s powers before </p><p>Parliament soon; PA divided; alternatives considered </p><p> </p><p>Ref: (A) Colombo 1555 </p><p> </p><p>     (B) Colombo 1551 </p><p>     (C) Colombo 1441 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, DCM.  Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  A proposed amendment to limit the </p><p>President\'s power to dissolve Parliament and to permit </p><p>voting outside of party lines is to be considered this </p><p>week.  PA representatives split on the amendment.  While </p><p>supporting the amendment, minority parties still </p><p>concerned with some issues.  Alternatives to the </p><p>amendment are still being considered.  If the amendment </p><p>passes it may have a profound long-term effect on Sri </p><p>Lankan politics.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The United National Front (UNF) is expected to </p><p>table the 18th Amendment before Parliament on August 29. </p><p>The amendment, as it is currently being discussed, will </p><p>strip the President\'s power to dissolve Parliament one </p><p>year after it was elected and will permit individuals to </p><p>vote outside of party lines (commonly referred to as </p><p>conscience voting). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As recently as August 23, representatives of the </p><p>People\'s Alliance (PA) maintained that the UNF could not </p><p>get enough cross-over votes to pass the amendment (Ref </p><p>A).  Harim Peiris, the Presidential Spokesman, assured </p><p>poloff that with the support of the minority parties </p><p>aligned with the PA the amendment would fail.  As of </p><p>August 26, they are no longer as confident. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The minority parties are divided on the issue. </p><p>Members of the TNA have stated that they will vote with </p><p>the UNF government in support of the amendment, despite </p><p>their reservations.  K. Ponnambalam summed up TNA </p><p>concerns when he stated they did not support the </p><p>sections of the amendment concerning conscience voting, </p><p>but the TNA\'s distrust of the President was so great </p><p>that they had to compromise.  As a counterpoint, Douglas </p><p>Devananda, Leader of the Eelam People\'s Democratic </p><p>Party, states that his party will vote with the </p><p>President.  In addition, Devananda believes that the </p><p>amendment will have to be presented before the Supreme </p><p>Court, which will rule that the amendment must be put </p><p>before the people as a referendum.  Desmond Fernando, a </p><p>highly regarded constitutional lawyer, confirmed that </p><p>the amendment will have to go before the Supreme Court, </p><p>but without seeing the final version of the amendment he </p><p>was unwilling to speculate on whether or not a </p><p>referendum would be needed.  (Note:  The constitution </p><p>gives explicit instruction on which issues need a 2/3 </p><p>majority in Parliament and which a referendum to come </p><p>into law.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Despite the public debate on the expected </p><p>amendment, there is no guarantee that the version </p><p>finally submitted will match the contours of the current </p><p>debate.  Milinda Moragoda, Minister of Economic Reform, </p><p>informed the DCM that the UNF might split the amendment </p><p>into two separate amendments.  A.M. Hizbullah a PA MP </p><p>and Dayaratna of the Prime Minister\'s office, both state </p><p>that the President\'s and Prime Minister\'s </p><p>representatives are talking to each other about a </p><p>compromise amendment.  (Note:  This coincides with what </p><p>former Foreign Minister Kadirgamar told the Deputy </p><p>Secretary last week, Ref A.)  Hizbullah believes that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>they will, of necessity, find a compromise amendment to </p><p>present to Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  Although much of the immediate focus is </p><p>on limiting the President\'s power to dissolve </p><p>Parliament, the possible inclusion of conscience voting </p><p>may have a more substantial change in Sri Lankan </p><p>politics.  Currently party members are tied more to the </p><p>party leader than their electorate.  If a person were </p><p>permitted to vote outside of party lines without being </p><p>expelled from parliament their responsiveness to the </p><p>community they represent may well increase.  Having said </p><p>that, what the amendment will actually have in it is </p><p>still speculation, the only issue that almost everyone </p><p>seems to agree on is that Sri Lanka is not ready for </p><p>another election in the near future.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
