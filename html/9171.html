<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 003047 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, IT, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: BERLUSCONI\'S MOUTH MAKES SECOND ROME TREATY FAR </p><p>LESS LIKELY -- AND IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 3029 </p><p>Classified By: POL MINCOUNS THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, REASONS 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  Berlusconi\'s tasteless insult to German </p><p>MEP Martin Schulz reduces the likelihood of a second Treaty </p><p>of Rome and exacerbates the difficulties the Prime Minister </p><p>will have serving in the role of "honest broker" as European </p><p>Council President-in-Office.  The vast majority, </p><p>non-headline-grabbing work of the Presidency will not be </p><p>affected; Italy\'s MFA has laid the ground well to make </p><p>progress on GOI priorities.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Berlusconi\'s offensive rejoinder to Schulz\'s attacks </p><p>is not unexpected, although it came earlier in the Italian </p><p>Presidency than most would have predicted.  Berlusconi must </p><p>be extremely frustrated with the unfairness of the criticism </p><p>directed against him, questioning his (and by extension, </p><p>Italy\'s) fitness to lead Europe.  This criticism, in the eyes </p><p>of many Italians, comes from those who already enjoy the </p><p>immunity the Prime Minister was awarded by the Italian </p><p>Parliament; who have never accepted Berlusconi and his </p><p>non-traditional, self-made roots; and who insist on </p><p>besmirching an Italy that in 2003 bears little resemblance to </p><p>the stereotypes perpetrated in much of the commentary across </p><p>Europe. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Berlusconi has used the same tactics in his domestic </p><p>political battles, to great effect.  When the center-left </p><p>opposition attacks, he turns the attack back on them, </p><p>ratcheting the volume and intensity up by degrees.  It has </p><p>worked, and he remains popular among his electorate.  His </p><p>stupid rise to Schulz\'s bait, however, will not win him the </p><p>respect of Italy\'s centrist or undecided voters, and </p><p>certainly is not in keeping with Italian devotion to avoiding </p><p>the "brutta figura."  Berlusconi\'s reaction was predictable, </p><p>too, in that Schulz\'s criticism was part of a coordinated </p><p>campaign among European socialists, as the PM later claimed. </p><p>(NOTE:  We agree it is likely that the Italian opposition </p><p>provided the ammunition for Schulz\'s fusillade.)  In </p><p>responding to Schulz, Berlusconi was responding to his own </p><p>opposition, employing tried and true tactics.  Berlusconi is, </p><p>as well, convinced of overarching collusion on the left, </p><p>whether between Italy\'s left-wing parties and its judiciary </p><p>(reftel explains why we don\'t think he\'s completely off base </p><p>with this one); Italy\'s left and its European counterparts; </p><p>or the left and the media (including both state-owned RAI and </p><p>his own TV networks; certainly neither spares Berlusconi from </p><p>criticism). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Explaining his reaction does not make it any less </p><p>stupid.  EC President Prodi\'s recommendation was right.  When </p><p>asked how the EU could avoid "personalizing" the EU </p><p>Presidency for the next six months, he replied "by not </p><p>answering your question."  We are hard-pressed to predict </p><p>whether Berlusconi\'s staff and close associates can </p><p>successfully train their shoot-from-the-hip, self-confident, </p><p>at times arrogant, self-made tycoon-turned-Prime Minister to </p><p>follow Prodi\'s sage advice in the case of future </p><p>provocations, which will come any time he sets foot in the </p><p>European Parliament.  History does not suggest Silvio </p><p>Berlusconi can restrain himself.  His exchange with Schulz is </p><p>emblematic of why Berlusconi has been a successful </p><p>businessman and winner in Italy\'s political trench warfare, </p><p>but it also shows why he may not be cut out for the role of </p><p>the EU\'s back-room broker.  Before giving up all hope, </p><p>however, we note that many political and business deals are </p><p>also made in back rooms, where Berlusconi\'s skills at </p><p>persuasion, if not compromise, have been proven. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The vast majority of work under the Italian </p><p>Presidency will not be affected by the outburst. Berlusconi\'s </p><p>prepared remarks to the European Parliament, which few will </p><p>now bother to read, actually outlined a forward-looking </p><p>agenda that should enjoy consensus support.  The Italian MFA </p><p>is well-prepared and the machinery is in place for a </p><p>successful Presidency.  Most GOI priorities for its semester, </p><p>such as promoting further Balkans stability, closer EU-Russia </p><p>relations, and EU-wide immigration reform, will continue </p><p>unimpeded.  Decisions that can be reached at the working </p><p>level will be made.  Those that must be resolved by heads of </p><p>state -- and we cannot predict which those will be -- will be </p><p>harder.  There will be, we are certain, plenty of cases where </p><p>political compromise will be in the self-interest of all, and </p><p>will be reached.  There may be others where this incident, </p><p>and more importantly Berlusconi\'s personality traits which </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>underpin it, may impede progress. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  His imprudence may eventually be held against him </p><p>when he attempts to bring the Convention/Constitution </p><p>document back to Rome after the Intergovernmental Conference </p><p>(IGC) process is completed, most likely during the Irish </p><p>Presidency.  We suspect that lingering bad feeling and </p><p>distaste may make many EU member states reluctant to allow </p><p>Berlusconi to preside over the highly symbolic treaty signing </p><p>ceremony, and risk another of his tirades which could mar </p><p>Europe\'s big day.  His chances may depend in part on whether </p><p>and how well he apologizes to German Chancellor Schroeder in </p><p>a telephone call later today. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03047 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
