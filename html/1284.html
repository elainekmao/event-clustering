TOM MCDONALD.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A PARLIAMENTARY SESSION ATTENDED BY POLOFF, </p><p>HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN NKOMO READ A BRIEF GOVERNMENT </p><p>STATEMENT ON THE POLICE RAIDS AGAINST THE MDC LAST WEEK </p><p>(REFS B AND C).  AFTER READING WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A </p><p>POLICE REPORT ON THE BOMBING OF THE MDC HEADQUARTERS TWO </p><p>DAYS BEFORE THE RAIDS (REF A), NKOMO SAID THE POLICE </p><p>FOUND ENOUGH EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE TO INDICATE THAT THE </p><p>GRENADE ATTACK WAS "AN INSIDE JOB."  NKOMO DID NOT </p><p>ELABORATE ON WHY THE MDC MIGHT CHOOSE TO BOMB ITS OWN </p><p>HEADQUARTERS.  HE DID SAY THAT IN THE RAIDS, THE POLICE </p><p>CONFISCATED SEVERAL HAND GRENADES, A LOADED PISTOL, AND </p><p>A BOX OF 500 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, ALL OF WHICH ARE </p><p>STILL BEING HELD BY THE POLICE.  HE STATED THE WEAPONS </p><p>HAD BEEN TRACED TO MALAYSIA AND HAD BEEN IMPORTED </p><p>THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA.  HE WENT FURTHER TO SAY OBLIQUELY </p><p>THAT THE POLICE HAD UNCOVERED ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE TODAY </p><p>THAT WOULD WARRANT CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST UNNAMED </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE MDC. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IMMEDIATELY AFTER NKOMO READ THE STATEMENT, MDC </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE TOLD A NORWEGIAN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>EMBASSY DIPLOMAT THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S ACCUSATION OF </p><p>FINDING WEAPONS WAS "RUBBISH," BUT DID ADMIT THAT THE </p><p>POLICE CONFISCATED A "PELLET GUN" AND A RADIO OF SOME </p><p>KIND IN ADDITION TO THE DOCUMENTS AND COMPUTER FILES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: NKOMO\'S STATEMENT IS A CLEAR SIGN THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05302  191539Z </p><p>THE GOZ HAS MORE HARASSMENT IN STORE FOR THE MDC.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SUFFERED A SETBACK WHEN THE HIGH COURT </p><p>ORDERED THE RETURN OF THE SEIZED DOCUMENTS AND COMPUTER </p><p>FILES, AND THE POLICE WERE REQUIRED TO OBLIGE (REF D). </p><p>THE CHARGES LAID OUT BY NKOMO SMACK OF A FABRICATION OF </p><p>EVIDENCE AND A GOZ ATTEMPT TO SAVE FACE BY STICKING TO </p><p>ITS STORY THAT THE MDC IS IMPORTING "ARMS OF WAR."  ALL </p><p>OF OUR OPPOSITION INTERLOCUTORS HAVE REPEATEDLY AND </p><p>CREDIBLY DENIED THAT THE MDC IS IMPORTING OR STOCKPILING </p><p>WEAPONS.  IF THE POLICE IN FACT FOUND A PELLET GUN, </p><p>HOWEVER, THIS COULD PROVIDE A LOT OF GRIST FOR THE GOZ </p><p>PARANOIA MILL.  NKOMO\'S STATEMENT, IN ANY CASE, </p><p>DEMONSTRATES THAT THE GOZ (ZANU-PF) INTENDS TO RATCHET </p><p>UP ITS ATTACKS ON THE MDC. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
