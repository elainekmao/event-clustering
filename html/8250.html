<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001337 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/USOAS, L/WHA, WHA/CAR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, KTIA, AORC, GT, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA ON INTER-AMERICAN CONVENTION AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 118495 </p><p> </p><p>1. Information provided below is keyed to reftel questions: </p><p> </p><p>A. The OAS Terrorism Convention is not currently on the </p><p>legislative agenda.  Congress is in recess until August. </p><p>General elections will be held in November.  The Foreign </p><p>Ministry continues to consult internally and with various </p><p>line Ministries about the Convention. </p><p> </p><p>B. According to Sylvia Corado, Director for Multilateral </p><p>Affairs, the Foreign Ministry anticipates no obstacles to </p><p>eventual ratification.  Corado acknowledged that the process </p><p>has been slow but said that the political will Guatemala </p><p>showed when it signed the Convention is still in place. </p><p> </p><p>C. Until the Convention goes to Congress, the key leader in </p><p>the ratification process will be the Foreign Minister. </p><p>Corado believes it is unlikely the Convention will be </p><p>forwarded to the current Congress.  The leadership of the </p><p>next Congress will be determined in the upcoming elections. </p><p> </p><p>D. Currently, the FRG party holds a slight but disciplined </p><p>majority in Congress.  The party is led by retired General </p><p>Efrain Rios Montt. </p><p> </p><p>E. According to Corado, Guatemala can ratify the Convention </p><p>without making any legislative or regulatory changes. </p><p>However, once ratified, some changes will be required. </p><p>Corado said this was part of the reason consultations were </p><p>taking so long.  Although she could not recall details, </p><p>Corado said she had attended discussions related to changes </p><p>in asylum and extradition laws, and assured us that the </p><p>Government of Guatemala was preparing to move quickly once </p><p>the Convention is ratified.  Asked about constitutional </p><p>provisions related to extradition (Article 27), Corado could </p><p>only say the matter was under review and was not considered </p><p>an obstacle. </p><p> </p><p>F. Many of the Convention\'s obligations are already covered </p><p>by current legislation.  Technically, once the Convention is </p><p>ratified it will have the force of law.  Corado called this a </p><p>"gray area" and said that the Foreign Ministry would propose </p><p>the necessary legislative changes to Congress once the </p><p>Convention was ratified. </p><p> </p><p>G. In Guatemala, the text of a convention is approved by the </p><p>Congress and ratified by the President.  Ratification is not </p><p>automatic following approval of the text by Congress. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
