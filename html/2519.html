<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 ABUJA 000596 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEA FOR OFE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, ASEC, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  FY2002 LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE PLAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 189082    B)  01 LAGOS 1042 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) Introduction:  The USG\'s law enforcement program in </p><p>Nigeria is dynamic and diverse, covering eight major areas: </p><p>counter-narcotics; fighting financial fraud, particularly </p><p>"419" advance-free fraud; immigration crimes; police </p><p>modernization; anti-corruption; extradition, trafficking in </p><p>persons, and money laundering.  Reflecting these priorities </p><p>outlined in the Mission\'s Performance Plan (MPP) are the </p><p>resources found in the presence at the Mission of DEA, FBI, </p><p>USSS, DSS, DSS Anti-Fraud Unit, INL and, soon to be added, </p><p>DOJ\'s ICITAP.  The INL program which began in earnest in </p><p>February 2001 with the opening of the Regional Narcotics </p><p>and Law Enforcement Office (RNLEO), provides funding for </p><p>training and assistance projects to the Nigerian Government </p><p>in collaboration with these USG law enforcement agencies. </p><p>Per Ref A\'s guidance, law enforcement projects proposed tie </p><p>together training, technical assistance and the provision </p><p>of some equipment and material. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) Regional Note:  Most of the USG law enforcement </p><p>agencies\' offices resident in the Mission have regional </p><p>coverage, of varying scope and size.  While this LE </p><p>assistance plan is for Nigeria, consideration for regional </p><p>needs is addressed as much as possible, especially in the </p><p>area of training, to foster greater cooperation within the </p><p>West African sub-region.  Efforts will be made in </p><p>particular to engage ECOWAS on a number of law enforcement </p><p>and security issues such as Trafficking in Persons, </p><p>Counter-Narcotics, and addressing the proliferation of </p><p>small arms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Framework:  Bilateral Law Enforcement Committee </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) Advancement of USG law enforcement goals in Nigeria </p><p>is accomplished through the U.S.-Nigeria Law Enforcement </p><p>Committee, which met for the first time on November 9, 2001 </p><p>in Washington D.C..  The eight priority law enforcement </p><p>areas identified in paragraph one are built into the agenda </p><p>of this forum.  In a Joint Declaration signed at the </p><p>conclusion of the Committee\'s first meeting, the GON agreed </p><p>to take the following five steps by May 2002 (the next </p><p>meeting of the Committee): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- introduce and seek to pass legislation to revise the </p><p>1995 Money Laundering Act and create a financial </p><p>intelligence unit to improve the fight against money </p><p>laundering in line with FATF criteria; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- commence an investigation of at least one major Nigeria- </p><p>based drug trafficker with the DEA; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- introduce and seek to pass legislation allowing for the </p><p>civil forfeiture of assets derived from proceeds of </p><p>organized crime and drug trafficking; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- commence extradition proceedings of individuals wanted </p><p>for prosecution by the U.S. Government; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- give the Independent Corrupt Practices and Related </p><p>Offenses Commission (ICPC) all necessary resources to </p><p>launch criminal cases against high-level officials accused </p><p>of corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(U) In return, the USG pledged to provide expanded </p><p>assistance and training to GON law enforcement agencies and </p><p>the Central Bank of Nigeria in the areas of counter- </p><p>narcotics, money laundering, financial fraud, police </p><p>reform, trafficking in persons, immigration crimes, </p><p>corruption and extradition.  This includes: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- assistance in the fields of information technology, </p><p>controlled drug deliveries, financial and assets </p><p>investigations, and criminal records management; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--collaboration with the NDLEA in the upgrading of the </p><p>NDLEA\'s training academy; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--activities to strengthen the capacity of law enforcement </p><p>agencies; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- efforts to increase international law enforcement </p><p>exchanges. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Nigerian Players </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>5.(U) Caveat: Lagos vs. Abuja.  The bulk of operational law </p><p>enforcement units addressing organized crime remains in </p><p>Lagos, West Africa\'s largest urban center and the hub of </p><p>organized crime for the country.   That said, a number of </p><p>senior law enforcement managers, formerly resident in </p><p>Lagos, have made the transition to Abuja, though some </p><p>maintain offices in Lagos and commute between the two </p><p>cities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) The Attorney General\'s Office/Ministry of Justice. </p><p>The late Attorney General, Bola Ige, was the Mission\'s </p><p>primary counterpart for law enforcement policy issues and </p><p>we expect the new AG to follow in this role.  All proposed </p><p>criminal laws are drafted by the AG\'s office (e.g. the new </p><p>revised Money Laundering Act and new Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission Act) and all extradition requests flow through </p><p>this office.  Federal prosecutions are under the AG\'s </p><p>control, and the Solicitor General, Mrs. T.A. Osinuga, </p><p>handles this caseload.  The new Attorney General will also </p><p>oversees the NDLEA, as did the late Attorney General. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). </p><p>Established in 1989, this is the Nigerian Government\'s sole </p><p>counter-narcotics agency.  Staffed by over 3,500 constables </p><p>and officers, the NDLEA is spread over 28 zones, with a </p><p>particular emphasis on interdicting narcotics at air- and </p><p>sea ports and international land borders.  It remains </p><p>headquartered in Lagos and its Chairman, Bello Lafiaji, </p><p>answers to the Attorney General in Abuja.  The NDLEA is not </p><p>part of the Nigerian Police Force.  This is DEA\'s sole </p><p>counter-part and its partner in a growing bilateral drug </p><p>enforcement and counter-narcotics assistance relationship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) Nigerian Customs Service (NCS).  Widely regarded as </p><p>the most corrupt of Nigeria\'s law enforcement agencies, the </p><p>NCS has as its official mandate the collection of </p><p>exorbitant duties from imports.  Unlike other nations\' </p><p>Customs Services, the NCS does not view drug interdiction </p><p>as part of its mandate.  It is not a significant partner in </p><p>USG law enforcement cooperation and is not a recipient of </p><p>USG assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(SBU) Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS).  Responsible </p><p>for all emigration/immigration controls at major </p><p>international entry and exit points, the NIS has been </p><p>engaged by the DS Anti-Fraud Unit at Post in an attempt to </p><p>improve the interdiction of U.S.-bound illegal aliens and </p><p>to confiscate fraudulent USG identity and immigration </p><p>documents.  NIS personnel have the power to detain and </p><p>arrest suspects but cannot arraign or prosecute (the Police </p><p>must be called in for criminal prosecution). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(SBU) Ministry of Justice/Department of Public </p><p>Prosecutions (DPP).  Under the Attorney General and </p><p>Minister of Justice, the DPP is responsible for prosecuting </p><p>cases in the Federal High Court of Nigeria (though the vast </p><p>majority of criminal cases, involving minor offenses, are </p><p>prosecuted by police officers). The main USG interest in </p><p>working with this office is the development of a functional </p><p>extradition process to submit Nigerian fugitives from USG </p><p>justice to U.S. courts for trial.  The DPP has only 20 </p><p>prosecutors for this country of 120 million people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(SBU) Special Assistant to the President for TIP and </p><p>Child Labor.  This position, established in mid-2001, was </p><p>created to coordinate the GON\'s response to the </p><p>international TIP problem.  The incumbent, Mike Mku, is </p><p>also attempting to coordinate foreign donors\' assistance to </p><p>Nigeria for anti-trafficking projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(SBU) The National Security Advisor (NSA) to the </p><p>President.  The NSA, retired LTG Aliyu Muhammed, serves as </p><p>the President\'s right-hand man on security and law </p><p>enforcement matters.  While not usually involved in the </p><p>routine execution of law enforcement policy, he has taken </p><p>the lead on special high-priority issues such as money </p><p>laundering in the post-September 11 era.  He acts on the </p><p>President\'s authority in ordering or coordinating law </p><p>enforcement actions or changes in policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.(SBU) The Ministry for Police Affairs (MPA).  This </p><p>Ministry was recreated by President Obasanjo to oversee the </p><p>management of the NPF after being eliminated at the outset </p><p>of the Abacha regime in 1994.  It ostensibly controls the </p><p>NPF\'s budget and supervises the Inspector General of Police </p><p>(IGP).  The last Minister for Police Affairs, however, did </p><p>not enjoy a cooperative relationship with the IGP, who </p><p>continues to use his direct channel to the President </p><p>liberally.  As it serves largely as a policy shop, the </p><p>MPA\'s staff is small and is not set up to run programs. </p><p>The Mission interacts regularly with the MPA -- </p><p>particularly with regard to the Police Reform cited below - </p><p>- but there are no projects directly specifically at the </p><p>Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.(SBU) The State Security Services (SSS).  This </p><p>intelligence and security agency is responsible for </p><p>safeguarding the country against foreign and domestic </p><p>terrorism and other national security threats.  It has </p><p>sweeping powers and operates throughout the country, </p><p>answering only to the Office of the Presidency, through the </p><p>National Security Advisor.  The Mission occasionally deals </p><p>with SSS on law enforcement matters such as terrorism </p><p>financing and particular criminal investigations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Nigerian Police Force (NPF) </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.(SBU) The NPF is headed by the Inspector General of </p><p>Police (IGP), Musiliu Smith, who ostensibly reports to the </p><p>Minister for Police Affairs, but in practice has a direct </p><p>line to the President.  Under the IGP\'s command are seven </p><p>Deputy Inspectors General (DIGs) -- the senior DIG and six </p><p>DIGs who oversee six Departments of the NPF -- </p><p>Administration (Department A); Operations (Department B); </p><p>Logistics (Department C); Criminal Investigations </p><p>Department--CID (Department D); Training (Department E); </p><p>and Research and Planning (Department F). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.(SBU) Operations (Department B).  This department is the </p><p>largest in the NPF, managing the basic law-and-order </p><p>deployment of police units on the street and the Mobile </p><p>Police (MOPOL), the NPF\'s "elite" force to deal with </p><p>violent crime, dignitary protection, and crisis situations. </p><p>The U.S. Mission relies on this Department for the security </p><p>of USG personnel and facilities and protection of visiting </p><p>U.S. dignitaries.  The U.S. business community also relies </p><p>on MOPOL for protection.  MOPOL has its own training </p><p>facility -- separate from that of the main police force -- </p><p>in Goza, near Maiduguri in the northeastern state of Borno. </p><p>Though no assistance is currently planned for MOPOL </p><p>personnel, the Mission hopes to include MOPOL in future </p><p>civil disorder management training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.(SBU) Criminal Investigations Department (Department D). </p><p>This is by far the most important Department in terms of </p><p>USG law enforcement interests.  USG LEAs are in contact </p><p>with its sub-entities on a daily basis, as it includes: </p><p>the Special Fraud Unit (SFU) responsible for fighting "419" </p><p>advance-fee fraud; the INTERPOL liaison office responsible </p><p>for dealing with all foreign law enforcement liaison; the </p><p>Forensics Laboratory; and the Trafficking in Persons Task </p><p>Force.  Currently, all four of these units reside in Lagos, </p><p>though the INTERPOL liaison office may soon move to Abuja. </p><p>Project proposals contained in this assistance plan affect </p><p>all four of these units. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.(SBU) Training (Department E).  The Training Department, </p><p>managed by DIG Baba Ahmadu, runs four basic recruit Police </p><p>Training Colleges (Ikeja/Lagos, Maiduguri, Enugu, and </p><p>Kaduna), five smaller schools for new constable recruits, </p><p>the Officer Training Academy in Kano, and a mid-level </p><p>officer training Staff College in Jos.  The Police Reform </p><p>Program to begin in March 2002 is designed to foster broad </p><p>strategic reforms through the initial provision to this </p><p>Department of a small model training program for new </p><p>recruits in the four Police Colleges.  Senior and mid-level </p><p>management training of NPF officers will also be provided </p><p>at both the Jos Staff College and the Kano Officer Academy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.(SBU) State Police units.  Although the Nigerian </p><p>constitution does not allow for state or local police </p><p>forces, many governors have constituted de facto state </p><p>police units through the back door.  This has been done by </p><p>governors\' funding of particular groups of federal police </p><p>to provide enhanced security functions at the state level. </p><p>When funded largely or wholly by a State government these </p><p>police units become beholden to the state governor, though </p><p>still ostensibly a part of the federal police force.  A </p><p>good example of this growing trend is the Rapid Response </p><p>Squad (RRS) in Lagos State -- a unit of 700 police set up </p><p>by Governor Bola Tinubu.  Vehicles, fuel and daily stipends </p><p>are funded out of the Lagos State treasury.  Similar units </p><p>have appeared in Rivers, Kaduna, and Oyo states.  The </p><p>Mission has provided training and modest equipment to the </p><p>Lagos RRS to assist it in attacking violent organized crime </p><p>in the city. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Proposed Projects of INL\'s Nigeria Program </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.(U) The following breaks down the Mission\'s law </p><p>enforcement plan into projects addressing each of the eight </p><p>major law enforcement areas, along with specific projects </p><p>and training activities tied to each objective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Counter-Narcotics </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.(SBU) During the past year, INL resources (FY99- </p><p>$150,000; FY00-$350,000) were used to provide the NDLEA </p><p>with new vehicles, repair existing vehicles in the NDLEA </p><p>fleet, provide communications equipment for key units </p><p>assigned to the Lagos air- and sea-ports, and drug </p><p>detection scanners to improve interdiction efforts at </p><p>airports in Lagos, Abuja and Kano.  Additionally, </p><p>assistance planned from FY01 funds ($150,000) will assist </p><p>the NDLEA Academy in Jos with training-related equipment </p><p>and USG-provided training.  A DEA course in basic drug </p><p>enforcement skills (DEA-01) funded in FY00 will be </p><p>implemented in mid-2002 to support the NDLEA Academy. </p><p>Similarly, a DEA course on Airport Interdiction (DEA-05) </p><p>will be implemented in mid-2002 to support NDLEA airport </p><p>units assisted by INL-provided equipment (a FY00 project). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.(SBU) Targeting Major Traffickers.  FY02: $200,000 for </p><p>telephone intercept equipment.  The NDLEA has been assisted </p><p>with basic drug enforcement resources through previous INL </p><p>funding (vehicles, communications gear, drug detection </p><p>equipment).  This new FY02 project will provide the NDLEA\'s </p><p>Joint Task Force\'s with cellular phone intercept equipment, </p><p>which will boost the Joint Task Force\'s ability to </p><p>investigate major drug traffickers in cooperation with DEA. </p><p>An offering of U.S. Customs course USCS-01 (Overseas </p><p>Enforcement Training Program--OET) is proposed for FY02 </p><p>funding to improve the skills of the NDLEA investigators in </p><p>the Joint Task Force.  RNLEO and DEA will monitor and </p><p>report on the use and effectiveness of the equipment and </p><p>training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23.(SBU) Improving Interdiction Efforts.  FY02: $50,000 for </p><p>a DEA Airport Interdiction Course.  Continuing with </p><p>implementation of the INL-funded effort to improve the </p><p>NDLEA\'s interdiction efforts at the Lagos air- and sea - </p><p>ports, DEA will provide an additional offering of the </p><p>course - DEA-05 - on Airport Interdiction Skills.  RNLEO </p><p>and DEA will continue to monitor, through scheduled visits </p><p>and surprise spot checks, the effectiveness of USG-assisted </p><p>NDLEA interdiction efforts at Murtala Muhammed </p><p>International Airport in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Police Reform </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25.(SBU) FY02: $1.1 million.  Building on demonstration </p><p>projects begun in FY2002 with FY01 INL and ESF funds and </p><p>implemented by ICITAP, additional projects to: 1) improve </p><p>the NPF\'s forensic analytical capabilities ($300,000); 2) </p><p>strengthen the currently weak cooperation between police </p><p>investigators and state-level public prosecutors </p><p>($200,000); and 3) provide Civil Disorder Management and </p><p>specific conflict resolution training to special police </p><p>units (e.g. the Rapid Response Squad in Kaduna) in order to </p><p>improve the NPF\'s capacity to contain election-related </p><p>violence in key violence-prone urban areas (e.g. Kano, </p><p>Kaduna, Jos, Makurdi).  Both activities are high priorities </p><p>designated by GON policy-makers.  $150,000 in funding will </p><p>be used to provide equipment to CDM units trained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26.(U) This funding will extend the ICITAP-implemented </p><p>Police assistance program to begin in March 2002.  RNLEO </p><p>and ICITAP Project Manager (PM) will monitor progress and </p><p>effectiveness of this project and report regularly to INL. </p><p>A detail proposal will be sent to INL/AAE separately via e- </p><p>mail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27.(SBU) FY02--$200,000 in related training.  The Police </p><p>Reform Program will be complemented by FBI-provided </p><p>training in three specialized investigative courses and a </p><p>training-of-trainers (TOT) activity.  The three </p><p>investigative courses are: 1) FBI-XX: Investigating Serious </p><p>Crimes (Homicide); 2) FBI-XX: Interview and Interrogation; </p><p>and 3) FBI-XX: Surveillance Techniques.  The training-of- </p><p>trainers activity will be coordinated with the ICITAP </p><p>Police Reform Program Manager to best support ongoing </p><p>training assistance to police institutions.  Each course </p><p>and the TOT activity is estimated to cost $50,000.  RNLEO </p><p>and ICITAP Project Manager (PM) would monitor and report on </p><p>the effectiveness of this training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fighting "419" Advance-Fee Fraud </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28.(SBU) FY02: $100,000 for a technical assistance project </p><p>on asset forfeiture and $100,000 for related USSS training. </p><p>Building on FY00 provision of vehicles and equipment </p><p>($185,000) and FY01 advanced computer forensics training </p><p>($79,700) to the NPF\'s Special Fraud Unit and INTERPOL </p><p>office to enhance operations against 419 fraud operators in </p><p>the Lagos area, this project seeks to make those operations </p><p>more effective through the systematic seizure and ultimate </p><p>forfeiture of criminal assets of 419 organizations. </p><p>Working with the SFU, a USSS technical advisor will help </p><p>design a program for the tracking of assets and, with the </p><p>cooperation of the Attorney General\'s office, will assist </p><p>the NPF in the drafting of new legislation to allow for the </p><p>speedy forfeiture of these assets.  Complementing this </p><p>technical assistance will be a regional training seminar on </p><p>financial crimes for police and Central Bank investigators </p><p>sponsored by the West African Institute for Financial and </p><p>Economic Management (WAIFEM) and Central Bank </p><p>investigators.  Also, a USSS course on Combating Economic </p><p>Fraud and Counterfeiting (USSS-01) and a customized USSS </p><p>training activity, an Anti-Counterfeiting Technical </p><p>Assistance Initiative (USSS-03) will be provided to NPF </p><p>anti-fraud investigators.  All of these training efforts </p><p>directly support the ongoing INL-project to strengthen the </p><p>capacity of the NPF and other investigative forces in the </p><p>region to attack 419 and other forms of financial fraud. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anti-Corruption </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29.(SBU) DOJ\'s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial </p><p>Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) will begin </p><p>implementation of a $445,000 (FY01 ESF) project to provide </p><p>investigative and prosecutorial training and technical </p><p>assistance to the GON\'s Independent Corrupt Practices and </p><p>Other Related Offenses Commission (ICPC) in April 2002.  A </p><p>follow-on proposal to provide the ICPC with a Training-of- </p><p>Trainers (TOT) project has been proposed with FY2002 ESF </p><p>funds.  This will give the ICPC a sustainable capacity to </p><p>train new personnel planned for hiring in late 2002 and </p><p>beyond. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Combating Trafficking in Persons (TIP) </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>30.(U)  No FY02 INL funds are anticipated for anti-TIP </p><p>purposes.  $200,000 in FY01 INL funds will be devoted to </p><p>support the NPF\'s Anti-TIP Task Force and sensitization </p><p>training for NPF personnel involved in fighting TIP crimes. </p><p>Additionally, $300,000 is requested in G/TIP funds for </p><p>investigative and prosecutorial training, through OPDAT and </p><p>ICITAP, for NPF and MOJ/DPP investigators and prosecutors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Money-Laundering </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>31.(SBU) FY02: $200,000.  The GON\'s proposed Financial </p><p>Crimes Commission is expected to start operating later in </p><p>CY2002.  This commission will have full investigative, </p><p>arrest and prosecutorial powers to address money laundering </p><p>and other financial crimes and will be under the Office of </p><p>the President.  This project will provide technical </p><p>assistance ($125,000) in the form of USG money laundering </p><p>experts sent to Nigeria on extended TDYs to assist the </p><p>Commission with implementing effective regulations and will </p><p>assist the new Commission with modest equipment ($75,000). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Immigration Crimes </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>32. FY02: $100,000 in equipment for NIS Anti-Fraud Unit and </p><p>$50,000 for DS Anti-fraud course.  A draft MOU governing </p><p>the role of U.S. INS agents working at the Lagos </p><p>international airport and the GON\'s commitment to fighting </p><p>immigration fraud emerged from recent bilateral </p><p>discussions, particularly the November 9, 2001 meeting of </p><p>the Bilateral LE Committee.  Included in the MOU is mention </p><p>of agreed upon USG assistance to the NIS in fighting </p><p>immigration fraud committed by Nigerian nationals </p><p>attempting to board US-bound flights.  INS agents stationed </p><p>TDY at the Lagos airport will work closely with the new NIS </p><p>anti-fraud unit to interdict malafide passengers attempting </p><p>to embark on flights to the U.S.  This project will provide </p><p>modest equipment -- specifically fraudulent document </p><p>detection scanners -- and a DS training course (DS-01: </p><p>International Travel Document Fraud) for NIS investigators </p><p>and airline security personnel to support this joint </p><p>effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Budget Summary </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>33.
