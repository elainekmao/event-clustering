<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001064 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR TASK FORCE 1 - EB ACTION OFFICER </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR EB/ESC AND NEA/ARP </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/MAC/AME </p><p>DOE FOR IE - L. COBURN AND C. WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 X1, X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT OIL UPDATE -- MARCH 24, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 1049 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reasons 1.5. (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A detailed breakdown of Kuwait\'s oil production is not </p><p>yet available for today, but Embassy is told output from 0500 </p><p>03/23/03 to 0500 03/24/03 reached 2.42 million barrels. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Kuwaiti firefighters apparently put out one of the </p><p>fires burning in Iraq\'s Rumaila oilfield today, and they are </p><p>prepared to continue the effort.  Embassy is working with </p><p>officials of the Kuwait Oil Company and the U.S. Army Corps </p><p>of Engineers (USACE) to ensure the KOC team is working in as </p><p>safe and secure an environment as possible.  USACE (working </p><p>under the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian </p><p>Assistance) will also coordinate KOC efforts with those of </p><p>U.S. contractors to combat the blazes. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A senior KOC official said that part of the </p><p>firefighting effort is the resumption of production from the </p><p>Ratqa field (which straddles the Kuwait Iraq border to become </p><p>the Rumaila field).  By increasing production, pressure in </p><p>the reservoir will drop making the fires less dangerous. </p><p>Ratqa reportedly made 15,000 barrels today and will rise to </p><p>30,000 bpd by tomorrow. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
