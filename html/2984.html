<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002529 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: JO, KISL, PGOV, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: TENSE REGIONAL SITUATION INCREASES ELECTION </p><p>UNCERTAINTY </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 AMMAN 03093 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Developments across the river and elsewhere in the </p><p>region continue to place strong pressure on King Abdullah\'s </p><p>reformist agenda.  Along with the pressure, speculation </p><p>concerning the status of parliamentary elections that were </p><p>tentatively scheduled for the fall has grown.  On May 10, </p><p>Jordan\'s Prime Minister stated that a date for holding </p><p>elections will be announced in July, unless extraordinary </p><p>circumstances make elections "impossible."  The Prime </p><p>Minister did not comment on what might happen if elections </p><p>are deemed impossible, and left open the possibility that the </p><p>King might reinstate the former parliament.  The general </p><p>belief among Embassy contacts is that the GOJ will not hold </p><p>elections this fall, though we are still being told by </p><p>Jordanian officials that no decision has been made.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>THE PM HINTS AT POSTPONEMENT OF ELECTIONS . . . </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Jordan\'s lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, was </p><p>dissolved in June 2001.  Following dissolution, the GOJ </p><p>announced that it would hold elections requisite to forming a </p><p>new parliament, but only after implementing new procedures </p><p>called for in a July 2001 temporary elections law.  The GOJ\'s </p><p>central aim in amending the elections laws was to promote a </p><p>moderate, pro-regime parliament - through redistricting, </p><p>redistributing parliamentary seats, reforming voter </p><p>registration mechanisms, and increasing representation from </p><p>tribal areas where the Islamic Opposition has little support </p><p>(reftel). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Until recently, the GOJ had indicated that elections </p><p>would be held in fall 2002 and it appeared that announcement </p><p>of a date could be imminent.  However, rumors to the contrary </p><p>have been circulating for some time.  This skepticism became </p><p>all the stronger when, on May 10, Prime Minister Ali Abul </p><p>Ragheb told the London-based daily Al Quds Al Arabi that the </p><p>GOJ will not announce a date until July.  Abul Ragheb said </p><p>the GOJ will prepare to conduct elections by the end of the </p><p>year, but acknowledged that "extraordinary regional </p><p>circumstances" could yet make elections impossible.  When </p><p>asked if the old parliament might be reinstated, Abul Ragheb </p><p>noted that this prerogative rests with the King.  Abul Ragheb </p><p>again addressed the elections topic during a May 20 meeting </p><p>with the Ambassador.  According to the Prime Minister, the </p><p>GOJ will monitor the internal political situation in May and </p><p>June, and make a decision on elections in July.  He hoped </p><p>that development projects coming on line in June as well as </p><p>the anticipated Middle East peace conference would produce </p><p>more favorable conditions for elections. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Abul Ragheb\'s reference to "extraordinary regional </p><p>circumstances" clearly encompasses the situation on the West </p><p>Bank and the possibility of a U.S. offensive against Iraq, </p><p>both of which bolster sympathy for the Islamic viewpoint.  As </p><p>a former parliamentarian representing Madaba puts it, the </p><p>Islamic Opposition is enjoying a growing surge of support </p><p>generated by the perception that Islam alone can offer </p><p>deliverance from vexing regional issues.  (Comment: Equally </p><p>to the point, even many people who have no use for the </p><p>Islamists\' program would be tempted to cast protest votes.) </p><p>He and other former parliamentarians parrot the popular </p><p>belief that the GOJ will be loath to lock in strong Islamist </p><p>parliamentary representation - and thereby allow a primary </p><p>purpose of the new elections law to be defeated - by holding </p><p>elections at a time when Islamist influence is unusually </p><p>strong. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>AND THE CONSTITUTION MAY PERMIT POSTPONEMENT </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The GOJ may end up foregoing elections on grounds that </p><p>"extraordinary regional circumstances" prevent them.  Under </p><p>the Constitution, when "a force majeure has occurred which . </p><p>. . render(s) the holding of elections impossible," a new </p><p>Chamber of Deputies does not have to be elected.  The King </p><p>can (but is not required to) in these circumstances reinstate </p><p>the former parliament.  If this were to happen, the former </p><p>parliament would resume its activities as if at the beginning </p><p>of an election cycle, though the King would retain his normal </p><p>prerogative to dissolve parliament at any time.  If the </p><p>conditions rendering the holding of elections impossible were </p><p>to abate without reinstatement of the old parliament, a new </p><p>parliament would have to be elected following abatement. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>BUT THERE IS BROAD SUPPORT FOR THE RESTORATION OF PARLIAMENT </p><p>. . . </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) We believe that there is broad support among the </p><p>public for the restoration of a functioning parliament. </p><p>Indeed, as a prominent human rights contact points out, </p><p>regional tensions make a functioning parliament more </p><p>important than it otherwise would be.  But the consensus </p><p>among several Embassy contacts is also that the most </p><p>legitimate way of restoring parliament would be through </p><p>holding elections, because conditions preventing elections do </p><p>not genuinely exist.  One contact, a University of Jordan law </p><p>professor, explains that regional (as opposed to domestic) </p><p>circumstances cannot - under well-settled legal principles - </p><p>provide a basis for declaring a force majeure in the first </p><p>place.  Another contact, the head of the El Urdon El Jadid </p><p>"think tank," also believes regional instability should not </p><p>provide a basis for declaring a force majeure because </p><p>instability in this region is endemic. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Many Embassy contacts believe the GOJ will reinstate </p><p>the old parliament as a means of averting election of a </p><p>strong Islamist block in a new parliament, though they view </p><p>the fear of Islamist "overrepresentation" as overblown.  Some </p><p>believe Islamists will not fare particularly well under the </p><p>procedures established by the temporary elections law (i.e., </p><p>a common prediction is that Islamists will only capture 15-20 </p><p>of 104 seats), and that the composition of the new parliament </p><p>will be more representative and democratic under the new law. </p><p> Another view is that strong Islamist representation in </p><p>parliament is actually desirable to some degree because it </p><p>will carry with it an increased resolve to battle government </p><p>corruption and promote other important causes.  On the other </p><p>hand, one former parliamentarian from rural Tafileh believes </p><p>the GOJ has reason to worry that sustained economic </p><p>difficulties are severely eroding tribal support for the </p><p>regime. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>AND THE ISLAMISTS WANT POLLS NOW </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Members of the Islamic opposition - who believe they </p><p>have the most to gain in elections - want elections as </p><p>quickly as possible.  Islamic Action Front (IAF) Secretary </p><p>General Hamza Mansour opposes "any new postponement or </p><p>bringing back the dissolved parliament."  The Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood has likewise gone on record "reiterat(ing) the </p><p>importance of maintaining a democratic process" by holding </p><p>elections this year.  Nonetheless, the IAF has said it will </p><p>defer a decision on whether to participate in elections until </p><p>after the GOJ sets a polling date.  According to one former </p><p>parliamentarian who was also a member of the IAF, deep </p><p>internal divisions underlie the decision to defer commitment </p><p>on this point.  Though the Islamic Opposition\'s parliamentary </p><p>elections boycott prevented it from taking any seats in 1997, </p><p>regional developments have added resonance to calls from </p><p>within the Opposition to again forego participation. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) As long as the GOJ maintains the position that </p><p>"extraordinary regional circumstances" constitute a force </p><p>majeure, it can claim that the Constitution relieves it of </p><p>any obligation to elect a new parliament, and it can continue </p><p>without a functioning parliament or by reinstating the old </p><p>one.  It is difficult to reliably predict which course the </p><p>King will ultimately choose.  No matter how much the King may </p><p>want to hold elections, he will have to balance this against </p><p>the risk that elections could result in a conservative or </p><p>Islamist parliament opposed to his reformist agenda.  In the </p><p>meantime, we expect rumors about the elections - and the </p><p>government reshuffle that might go with a decision to </p><p>postpone - to continue going the rounds with infinite </p><p>variations.  End comment. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
