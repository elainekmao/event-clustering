<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002383 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, EB/ESC/ESP AND S/CT </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC AND OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/07/2010 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EFIN, PTER, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN:  REGULATION OF CHARITIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 90100 </p><p>     B. 01 AMMAN 4871 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Jordanian charities and non-governmental social </p><p>service organizations are registered with and monitored by </p><p>the Ministry of Social Affairs and by the Ministry of </p><p>Religious Affairs in the case of religious organizations. </p><p>Their activities complement government-provided social </p><p>services, especially in poor areas of the country.  A number </p><p>of groups also direct charitable contributions to Palestinian </p><p>beneficiaries in the West Bank and Gaza.  Some of the larger </p><p>organizations, such as the Hashemite Welfare Foundation, </p><p>operate under the patronage of members of the royal family. </p><p>In addition, the Ministry of Industry and Trade supervises </p><p>the large and influential professional associations -- such </p><p>as the engineers, doctors, lawyers, and pharmacists </p><p>associations -- as well as chambers of industry and commerce. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Post has no information that Jordanian NGOs are </p><p>providing financing for terrorist organizations.  When we </p><p>raise the possibility, Jordanian government officials note </p><p>the small scale of Jordan\'s charitable infrastructure, </p><p>especially compared to that of the Gulf countries.  However, </p><p>the professional associations are relatively well provisioned </p><p>financially (for example, they collect membership dues and </p><p>manage pension funds for members) and their leaderships </p><p>espouse political beliefs similar to those of domestic </p><p>Jordanian Islamic opposition groups, such as the Islamic </p><p>Action Front.  This includes at least rhetorical support for </p><p>Palestinian "resistance groups." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  The oversight exercised by the government </p><p>organizations mentioned above is not stringent, and there may </p><p>be some unregulated groups with a putatively charitable </p><p>agenda.  Although the Jordanian security services, primarily </p><p>the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), are aware of the </p><p>potential of charitable organizations to provide funding for </p><p>terrorist activities, the GID\'s limited resources are </p><p>primarily focused on investigating suspected terrorists and </p><p>interdicting weapons for possible use in terrorist </p><p>operations.  The GID would likely be effective in monitoring </p><p>or stopping a specific financial transaction if provided the </p><p>necessary lead information.  However, due to the complexities </p><p>of distinguishing legitimate charitable contributions from </p><p>monies being funneled to terrorist groups, many such small </p><p>transactions could occur without being detected. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Comment:  The Jordanians are aware of the potential </p><p>misuse of charitable contributions for terrorist purposes. </p><p>However, since most officials believe the scale of such </p><p>activity is small, they tend to focus their limited resources </p><p>on the most immediate threats.  Upcoming GOJ participation in </p><p>ATA counterterrorism legislation training could help to raise </p><p>the sensitivity of Jordanian officials to these issues, as </p><p>could more focused training opportunities on mechanisms for </p><p>countering illicit financial transfers. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
