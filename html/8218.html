<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0141 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MAY 22, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for May 22, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Radikal/Cumhuriyet/Evrensel/Milli </p><p>Gazete/Turkiye/Milliyet/Hurriyet: As a result of </p><p>clashes between the security forces and members </p><p>of illegal organizations in Tunceli, two privates </p><p>were martyred while four organization members </p><p>were killed. A group of PKK/KADEK militants </p><p>firing on the soldiers near rural Atacinar </p><p>village in Tunceli the previous night killed two </p><p>soldiers. Reinforcement units dispatched to the </p><p>scene encircled the terrorist group, but clashes </p><p>continued throughout the night. Officials said, </p><p>in the region, there were around 30 PKK/KADEK </p><p>militants who had infiltrated into Turkey some </p><p>time ago. During clashes between security forces </p><p>and a group of TKP/ML (Turkish Communist </p><p>Party/Marksist Leninist Faction) and TIKKO </p><p>(Turkish Workers Villagers Communist Army) </p><p>members, four members of the illegal organization </p><p>were killed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Evrensel: Based on the permission from the </p><p>governor to return to their village, </p><p>approximately 500 people from Yesiloz village in </p><p>Sirnak left Van, Hakkari, and Cizre on May 16 for </p><p>their village. The families were not allowed to </p><p>go to the village by the Sub-govern orate and </p><p>Jandarma Command on grounds that the village </p><p>lacked the necessary infrastructure. The </p><p>villagers are being kept under military </p><p>supervision in an open space in the Village </p><p>Services Department\'s workshop. The villagers\' </p><p>request for tents has not been met. Villagers </p><p>claimed the problem stemmed from the Chief </p><p>Village Guard and Tribal Leader, Kemal Aslan, </p><p>having denounced the villagers to the Brigade </p><p>Command for allegedly assisting the PKK some time </p><p>ago. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Evrensel: Emin Ete, who was apprehended at </p><p>his store in Siirt on April 19, filed a petition </p><p>with the local public prosecutor claiming he was </p><p>taken by police to a field where he was exposed </p><p>to physical and psychological pressure. Ete also </p><p>claimed the police cut his fingers with a knife. </p><p>The court dropped the charges against the </p><p>policemen Sinasi Cetin and Senol Kutal, who are </p><p>stationed at the Anti-terror Department of Siirt </p><p>Security Directorate, on the grounds that there </p><p>was no evidence that police had wounded the </p><p>accuser. Opposing the court\'s decision, Ete said </p><p>police seized the physical report he obtained </p><p>after he had been wounded, and that he would </p><p>appeal the case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Hurriyet: The 6th Harmonization Package with </p><p>the EU, which will be submitted to the Prime </p><p>Ministry by the Ministry of Justice today, makes </p><p>it permissible to name children in Kurdish. The </p><p>ban in the Political Parties Law in regard to </p><p>campaigning in languages other than Turkish will </p><p>also be lifted, and amendments will be made in </p><p>the RTUK Law (Radio Television High Council). </p><p>Broadcasting on public and private TV channels </p><p>and radio stations of different languages and </p><p>accents the Turkish citizens use in their daily </p><p>lives will be permitted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Turkiye: Police teams from Adana arrested </p><p>eleven Somali nationals in a bus at the Adana Bus </p><p>Terminal. The Somalis had illegally crossed into </p><p>Turkey from Hatay at the Turkish-Syrian border, </p><p>and were planning to go to Italy. The Somalis </p><p>will be brought before the court for "coming into </p><p>the country through illegal ways." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Milliyet: Teams from the Organized Crimes </p><p>Department of the Adana Security Directorate </p><p>arrested a Tarik Cakar, the so called leader of </p><p>"Cakarlar," a gang involved in theft, pick- </p><p>pocketing and extorting money from shopkeepers in </p><p>various quarters of the town. It is claimed that </p><p>Cakar was involved in four murder cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Turkiye/Milliyet/Hurriyet: The Government and </p><p>UNICEF\'s joint project "The Child and Family </p><p>Education Program" was started in Mersin today. </p><p>Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Diyarbakir, Samsun, and </p><p>Mersin have been picked as pilot cities for the </p><p>program. Regarding the program which aims to end </p><p>domestic violence, the Deputy Governor of Mersin, </p><p>Ibrahim Seker, said three thousand families would </p><p>be educated throughout the province within the </p><p>framework of the program. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
