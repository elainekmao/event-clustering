<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 DAMASCUS 001761 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SY </p><p>SUBJECT: ASAD TELLS NODEL US LACKS VISION </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR THEODORE H. KATTOUF, REASON 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR THEODORE H. KATTOUF, REASON </p><p>1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: IN A TWO-HOUR DISCUSSION WITH CONGRESSMAN </p><p>DAVID PRICE, PRESIDENT AL-ASAD SAID THE US ADMINISTRATION HAS </p><p>NO CLEAR MIDDLE EAST VISION.  THE DISPARATE ADMINISTRATION </p><p>VOICES HURT THE US REGIONALLY.  PROGRESS TOWARDS </p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE REQUIRES A CLEAR AND CONSISTENT </p><p>VISION, AND IMPARTIAL US MEDIATION.  ASAD COMPLAINED THAT </p><p>THERE IS NO POLITICAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN SYRIA AND THE US, AND </p><p>THAT THE RELATIONSHIP \'ONLY COMES THROUGH ISRAEL.\'  ANY </p><p>SYRIAN EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR US POLICY COULD ONLY COME </p><p>AFTER EXTENSIVE BILATERAL DIALOGUE.  THE PROPOSED </p><p>QUARTET-INITIATED CONFERENCE COULD TURN INTO A POINTLESS </p><p>PHOTO OP, SINCE THE PRINCIPLES FOR A NEGOTIATED PEACE WERE </p><p>ALREADY ARTICULATED AND LAUNCHED AT MADRID.  US POLICY </p><p>TOWARDS IRAQ HAS SERVED ONLY TO MAKE SADDAM STRONGER; THE US </p><p>SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED WITH REGIONAL COUNTRIES BEFORE </p><p>THREATENING UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION.  A FREED ARAFAT CAN </p><p>STILL DO NOTHING, SINCE HE HAS NO RESOURCES AND THE INTIFADA </p><p>IS THE DOMINANT REALITY.  THE JENIN AND NABLUS \'MASSACRES,\' </p><p>WHICH \'KILLED OVER SIX HUNDRED PALESTINIANS,\' HAVE POSTPONED </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY OF PEACE.   ASAD SAID THAT \'NO ONE WANTS TO </p><p>HEAR\' TALK OF PEACE, AND SYRIA WOULD WAIT UNTIL EMOTIONS </p><p>COOLED BEFORE DECIDING WHAT TO DO.  HE CALLED FOR MORE VISITS </p><p>BY CONGRESSMEN AND SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS TO SYRIA, </p><p>SO THEY COULD GET A CLEARER PICTURE OF REGIONAL REALITIES. </p><p>WE TAKE ASAD AT HIS WORD THAT, GIVEN THE ENFLAMED PASSIONS </p><p>AND DYNAMIC REGIONAL SITUATION, SYRIAN POLICY WILL MOVE </p><p>TOWARD ITS TRADITIONAL DEFAULT OF \'WAITING.\'  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON MAY 4, CONGRESSMAN DAVID PRICE (D-NC) MET FOR TWO </p><p>HOURS WITH SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASAD.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>KATTOUF AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER) WERE ALSO PRESENT, AS WAS </p><p>WAYNE OWENS, PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR MIDDLE EAST PEACE </p><p>AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION; FM SHARA AND INTERPRETER/ADVISOR </p><p>DR. BUTHAYNA SHA\'BAN ATTENDED ON THE SYRIAN SIDE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PRESIDENT AL-ASAD TOLD PRICE HE\'D MET A LOT OF HIS </p><p>COLLEAGUES RECENTLY (PRICE WAS THE EIGHTH CODEL PRESIDENT </p><p>BASHAR RECEIVED IN RECENT MONTHS), AND WAS HAPPY TO MEET HIM. </p><p> THE US ADMINISTRATION SEEMED NOT TO BE FULLY \'IN THE </p><p>PICTURE.\' CONGRESSMAN PRICE\'S VISIT, LIKE THOSE OF HIS </p><p>PREDECESSORS, COULD HELP CONVEY A CLEARER PICTURE OF REGIONAL </p><p>REALITIES TO THE ADMINISTRATION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CONGRESSMAN PRICE THANKED ASAD FOR SYRIA\'S EFFECTIVE </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION, AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS </p><p>ENCOURAGED NOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS FULLY ENGAGED IN </p><p>THE REGION.  ALTHOUGH THE RECENT VISIT OF SECRETARY POWELL </p><p>DIDN\'T SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS, THE SYRIAN AND LEBANESE LEG OF THE </p><p>TRIP WAS SUCCESSFUL, FOR WHICH HE ALSO THANKED ASAD. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>US: NO CLEAR VISION, NO REAL DIALOGUE WITH SYRIA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ASAD SAID SYRIA AND OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE DONE ALL </p><p>THEY COULD TO KEEP THE US FULLY ENGAGED.  THROUGH MEETINGS </p><p>AND POLITICAL DISCOURSE, SYRIA HAS REPROACHED THE US FOR ITS </p><p>REGIONAL ABSENCE AND ENCOURAGED IT TOWARDS GREATER </p><p>ENGAGEMENT.  ONE OF THE CAUSES OF JENIN WAS THIS US ABSENCE. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, THE US HAS ALSO MADE MANY MISTAKES.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, PRESIDENT BUSH ERRED IN CALLING SHARON A \'MAN OF </p><p>PEACE\' WHILE THE LATTER WAS KILLING PALESTINIANS.  SUCH </p><p>STATEMENTS OBSTRUCT ANY POSITIVE US ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) REPEATING EARLIER CRITICISM THAT THE US SPEAKS WITH A </p><p>MULTIPLICITY OF VOICES, ASAD ASSERTED THAT \'THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION HAS NO CLEAR VISION ABOUT WHAT TO DO.\'  ASAD </p><p>ALSO COMPLAINED THAT THAT SYRIA DOESN\'T SEE US OFFICIALS </p><p>UNLESS THERE IS AN \'ISRAELI PROBLEM,\' AND THAT CURRENTLY </p><p>SYRIA HAS NO REAL DIALOGUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION.  \'I\'VE </p><p>MET WITH SECRETARY POWELL TWICE, AND ONE OF THESE VISITS (THE </p><p>MORE RECENT) WAS NOT EVEN PLANNED BEFOREHAND.\'  HE HAD ASKED </p><p>THE SECRETARY HOW COULD ANYTHING BE DISCUSSED IN ONE HOUR, </p><p>LET ALONE THE GOLAN AND THE MEPP, WHEN THEY\'D NOT MET IN </p><p>EIGHTEEN MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>SYRIAN STATEMENT OF SUPPORT </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) PRICE TOLD ASAD THAT IT WOULD BE CONSTRUCTIVE FOR HIM </p><p>TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS HIS AND HIS COUNTRY\'S SUPPORT FOR AN </p><p>ACTIVE US REGIONAL ROLE, OR TO DO SO PRIVATELY IF A PUBLIC </p><p>EXPRESSION WERE NOT POSSIBLE.  ASAD SAID THAT WHATEVER STAND </p><p>SYRIA TOOK WOULD BE A PUBLIC ONE.  IN ANY CASE, SYRIA </p><p>SUPPORTED POLICIES, NOT OFFICIALS.  SYRIA WOULD SUPPORT AN </p><p>APPROPRIATE US ROLE.  BUT SYRIA HAS ITS DIFFERENCES WITH THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, THE ISSUES ARE VERY COMPLEX, SYRIA WOULD NOT </p><p>BE ABLE TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT PRESIDENT BUSH UNTIL AFTER </p><p>EXTENDED BILATERAL DIALOGUE.  FOR THIS REASON, THE SYRIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT STATED, HE HAD CALLED FOR A BROADER BILATERAL </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE US. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) PRICE ASKED ASAD FOR HIS REACTION TO THE SUMMER </p><p>CONFERENCE PROPOSED BY THE QUARTET TO ADVANCE THE MEPP.  ASAD </p><p>SAID HE HAD NOT BEEN BRIEFED, AND ASKED WHAT WOULD BE THE </p><p>POINT OF THE CONFERENCE.  WHAT CAN THIS CONFERENCE ADD TO THE </p><p>MADRID LAND FOR PEACE FRAMEWORK?  ANSWERING HIS OWN QUESTION, </p><p>ASAD SAID THAT A CONFERENCE COULDN\'T ACHIEVE PEACE; ONLY </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS COULD.  THIS CONFERENCE WOULD BE CEREMONIAL. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) AMBASSADOR KATTOUF SUGGESTED THE CONFERENCE COULD </p><p>GIVE THE MEPP A NEW IMPETUS BY ALLOWING THE QUARTET, AND </p><p>OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES TO RECOMMIT THEMSELVES TO A NEGOTIATED </p><p>SETTLEMENT BASED ON THE MADRID PRINCIPLES.  ASAD RESPONDED </p><p>THAT IT COULD BECOME A MEDIA EVENT.  THE EU AND THE UN WANT </p><p>TO PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE, AND THE ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE </p><p>ALWAYS EXPRESSED THEIR DESIRE TO DO LIKEWISE.  REGARDLESS OF </p><p>A CONFERENCE, EVERYBODY WAS READY FOR PEACE.  BUT THE RECENT </p><p>ISRAELI \'MASSACRES\' HAVE DELAYED THE PEACE PROCESS LONGER </p><p>THAN MERELY THE TIME THAT SHARON REMAINED IN OFFICE.  ASAD </p><p>SAID HE SAW NO BENEFIT IN THE CONFERENCE, BUT IT WAS UP TO </p><p>THOSE PROPOSING IT TO STATE ITS PURPOSE. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) PRICE AGREED THERE WAS NOTHING NEW ABOUT THE THREE </p><p>PRIORITIES STATED BY SECRETARY POWELL, BUT IT WAS ALSO TRUE </p><p>THAT THE MEPP WAS IN SHAMBLES.  THE HOPE WAS THAT THE CYCLE </p><p>OF VIOLENCE COULD BE BROKEN.  PRICE ASKED ASAD HOW COULD WE </p><p>GET A FRESH START?  WHAT WERE VIABLE ALTERNATIVES TO THIS </p><p>CONFERENCE?  WHAT ELSE SHOULD THE US DO BESIDES SEEKING TO </p><p>CONTAIN THE VIOLENCE? </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ANSWERING, ASAD SAID DURING THE PAST PERIOD THERE </p><p>HAVE BEEN MANY FAILED INITIATIVES.  HE EXPECTED THESE </p><p>FAILURES AND TOLD THE US SO (READ: TENET-MITCHELL).  WHY DOES </p><p>THE US ALWAYS THINK IN TERMS OF \'LAUNCHING INITIATIVES?\'  IF </p><p>THERE IS NO INITIAL CLARITY, THE CONCERNED PARTIES WILL \'WALK </p><p>A DISTANCE AND THEN BE LOST AND AT JEOPARDY.\'  SWITCHING </p><p>ANALOGIES, ASAD SAID THAT SOME MEDICINES ARE ONLY TEMPORARY </p><p>AND DON\'T TREAT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE.  WE MUST GO BACK TO </p><p>THE \'RIGHT INITIATIVE\' - MADRID, WHICH WILL LEAD US TO PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>FORGET NEW CONFERENCE; ENFORCE MADRID </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) ASAD SAID THAT THE STARTING POINT FOR THE BUSH </p><p>ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO BE SUPPORTING PM SHARON WHILE HE </p><p>KILLS PALESTINIANS.  THESE MASSACRES HAVE HAD A HUGE REGIONAL </p><p>IMPACT AND HAVE HURT THE US, WHICH HAS LOST A LOT OF ITS </p><p>ARAB-WORLD, SEPTEMBER 11TH SYMPATHY.  BUT THE PEOPLE CAN BE </p><p>LED BEYOND ANTI-US FEELINGS, NOT BY FORCE, BUT BY POLITICAL </p><p>DISCUSSION, AND THIS IS WHERE A BILATERAL US-SYRIAN DIALOGUE </p><p>CAN BE VERY HELPFUL.  WHEN THE US ADMINISTRATION IS \'IN THE </p><p>PICTURE,\' IT CAN ACT CORRECTLY AND WILL GET REGIONAL SUPPORT. </p><p> THEREFORE, BILATERAL US-SYRIAN DIALOGUE IS MORE IMPORTANT </p><p>THAN ANY CONFERENCE INITIATIVE.  ASAD SAID HE KNEW OF THE </p><p>INFLUENCE OF DOMESTIC LOBBIES, AND THAT THE ARABS WERE NOT </p><p>DOING THEIR JOB IN LOBBYING OR PRESENTING A TRUE PICTURE TO </p><p>CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) CONGRESSMAN PRICE SAID THAT BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS AND </p><p>THIS CONFERENCE WERE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.  HE KNEW THE </p><p>APPARENT DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE US ADMINISTRATION WERE </p><p>CAUSING PROBLEMS GLOBALLY.  BUT SEPTEMBER 11TH HAD BEEN A </p><p>\'WAKE-UP CALL\' FOR PRESIDENT BUSH, AND NOW HE SHOULD BE TAKEN </p><p>AT HIS WORD CONCERNING HIS DESIRE FOR A LASTING PEACE. </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL IS THE PRESIDENT\'S EMISSARY AND SPEAKS </p><p>AUTHORITATIVELY ON HIS BEHALF.  THEY BOTH NEED SYRIA\'S HELP. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) RESPONDING TO WAYNE OWENS\' QUESTION ON HIS VIEWS </p><p>CONCERNING US ACTION AGAINST IRAQ, ASAD REPEATED HIS STANDARD </p><p>LINE THAT THE ONLY ACTION ACCEPTABLE WAS IMPLEMENTING UN </p><p>RESOLUTIONS.  WHAT THE US WAS CONTEMPLATING WOULD NOT WORK, </p><p>AND THE US NEEDED TO SERIOUSLY RECONSIDER ITS PLANS.  THE US </p><p>SHOULD CONSULT WITH COUNTRIES IN THE REGION; OTHERWISE, THE </p><p>US LOSES.  THE US ERROR LAY IN THINKING THAT MILITARY POWER </p><p>COULD SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) PRICE AGREED THAT VP CHENEY SHOULD HAVE COME TO </p><p>SYRIA.  HE ALSO AGREED THAT US MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ </p><p>WAS LIKELY.  HE TOLD ASAD THAT, WHILE HE STRONGLY BELIEVED </p><p>THAT THIS SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT, IRAQ POSED A REAL WMD </p><p>THREAT.  PRICE EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT THERE WERE </p><p>INTERMEDIATE STEPS TO TAKE BEFORE MILITARY ACTION.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THIS WAS HIS OWN VIEW, MANY IN THE CONGRESS SHARED IT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>ASAD\'S LETTER TO BUSH </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) COMMENTING THAT ASAD\'S LETTER TO PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>FOLLOWING 9/11 HAD BEEN IMPORTANT, OWENS SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>ANOTHER SUCH LETTER, COMMENTING ON THE GOOD THINGS THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE THUS FAR, WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL.  ASAD </p><p>SAID THAT HE WAS SURE THAT WHAT HE HAD SAID TODAY WOULD </p><p>SIMILARLY BE RELAYED UPWARDS, SO THAT THE INFORMATION WOULD </p><p>REACH THE PRESIDENT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. (COMMENT: DESPITE </p><p>REPEATED PROBING, ASAD GAVE NO INDICATION THAT THAT HE WOULD </p><p>BE WILLING TO ISSUE A STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL US </p><p>POLICY, EITHER PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>ARAFAT TOOTHLESS, REGION INFLAMED, SYRIA WILL WAIT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) IN RESPONSE TO PRICE\'S OBSERVATION THAT NEWLY-FREED </p><p>ARAFAT FACED A MAJOR TEST IN STEMMING PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE, </p><p>ASAD ASKED RHETORICALY WHAT MEANS WERE LEFT FOR ARAFAT TO DO </p><p>ANYTHING?  PRICE REPLIED THAT ASAD HAD A POINT.  HOWEVER, HE </p><p>WAS CONCERNED - THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS WERE CRITICAL, BUT </p><p>HE WAS HOPEFUL THAT SYRIA COULD BE OF MAXIMUM ASSISTANCE. </p><p>POWELL HAD TOLD ARAFAT THAT HE WAS DOWN TO HIS LAST CHANCE; </p><p>THERE WAS A DESPERATE QUALITY IN THE AIR.  WHAT DID PRESIDENT </p><p>ASAD THINK FRIENDS OF THE PALESTINIANS SHOULD DO? </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) ASAD REPEATED THAT ARAFAT COULD DO NOTHING.  HE HAS </p><p>NO POLICE, NO PRISON, AND THE ISRAELIS HAD EVEN KILLED HIS </p><p>COOK.  BUT EVEN BEFORE THESE WERE STRIPPED FROM HIM, HE WAS </p><p>POWERLESS.  THE INTIFADA WAS THE DE FACTO REALITY THAT ALL </p><p>HAD TO DEAL WITH.  ALTHOUGH ARAFAT HAD EMERGED FROM HIS </p><p>LATEST ORDEAL WITH A HEROIC AURA, IN THE LAST THREE DAYS HE </p><p>HAS REVEALED HIMSELF TO BE AN ACTOR.  SYRIA HAS KNOWN FOR </p><p>THIRTY YEARS THAT HE IS A LIAR.  HE HASN\'T CHANGED; THE US </p><p>DISCOVERED HIS NATURE TOO LATE.  HE HAD MISLED THE US </p><p>CONCERNING HIS ABILITIES AT A TIME WHEN \'NINETY PERCENT\' OF </p><p>THE SITUATION WAS OUTSIDE HIS CONTROL.  EVEN HIS IMMEDIATE </p><p>CIRCLE HAS REBELLED AGAINST HIM.  ALTHOUGH SYRIA EXPECTS </p><p>NOTHING FROM HIM, THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE.  WHO IS THERE IF </p><p>ARAFAT FALLS? - NOBODY. </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) AS FOR THE FUTURE, ASAD DIDN\'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. </p><p>\'WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED WHEN THE ISRAELIS KILL THE MOTHER AND </p><p>BROTHER OF A PERSON WHO THEN HAS TO STAY IN THE SAME ROOM </p><p>WITH THE DEAD BODIES FOR TWELVE HOURS?\'  ISRAEL HAD KILLED </p><p>\'SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE\' IN JENIN AND NABLUS, AND HAS NOW PRIMED </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE TO EXPLODE. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) CONTINUING, ASAD SAID \'WE CAN ALL EXPECT THE WORST, </p><p>AND WE ALL WILL PAY FOR SHARON, WHO HAS DELAYED THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS UNTIL PEOPLE FORGET THESE ATROCITIES.\'  MUCH AS THE </p><p>HORROR OF SEPTEMBER 11 WILL LONG REMAIN FRESH IN AMERICA\'S </p><p>MIND, SO TOO WILL THESE RECENTLY INFLICTED HORRORS LONG </p><p>REMAIN IN PALESTINIAN AND ALL ARAB MINDS. </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) THE US WAS PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE, BECAUSE IT DID NOT </p><p>STAND AGAINST SHARON AND THE PRO-ISRAELI LOBBY, ASAD </p><p>MAINTAINED.  THE ADMINISTRATION\'S PERFORMANCE WAS SO WEAK </p><p>WITH REGARDS TO ISRAEL THAT MANY PALESTINIANS CAME TO BELIEVE </p><p>THAT FIGHTING WAS THE ONLY SOLUTION.  THE PROBLEM WITH THE US </p><p>WAS THAT IT ONLY LOOKED FOR A SOLUTION AFTER THE PROBLEM HAD </p><p>GOTTEN OUT OF HAND.  THE PICTURE WAS BLACK, AND FOR NOW, </p><p>SYRIA WOULD WAIT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>ASAD: "OFF THE RECORD, I CAN SAY I WANT PEACE... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) ASAD SAID THAT \'OFF THE RECORD, I CAN SAY I WANT </p><p>PEACE, BUT I CAN\'T TELL THAT TO THE MEDIA, BECAUSE \'NO ONE </p><p>WANTS TO HEAR IT.\'  HE REPEATED THAT THE SITUATION WAS STILL </p><p>VERY EMOTIONAL, AND THAT SYRIA WOULD WAIT FOR EMOTIONS TO </p><p>COOL, AT WHICH TIME IT COULD DISCERN THE UNDERLYING </p><p>REALITIES.  THE PRESENT TIME WAS ONE OF PARALYSIS, EVEN IN </p><p>THOUGHT, \'BECAUSE THE ELEMENTS WERE NOT STABLE, AND THEREFORE </p><p>THE RESULTS NOT ACCURATE.\'  THIS HOWEVER WAS NOT A CALL FOR </p><p>PESSIMISM.  ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE DELAY, THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>EVENTUALLY WILL HAVE TO RESUME. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>ISRAEL KILLS SYRIAN CROWN PRINCE INITIATIVE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) PRICE ASKED IF CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S PEACE </p><p>INITIATIVE WERE A WAY FORWARD.  ASAD ANSWERED THAT SYRIA HAD </p><p>SUPPORTED IT, WHICH HAD GIVEN IT LEGITIMACY.  WITHIN THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD IT WAS SEEN AS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.  BUT TWO DAYS AFTER </p><p>THE ARAB SUMMIT, SHARON STARTED HIS MASSACRES.  SYRIA HAD </p><p>GIVEN LIFE TO THE CROWN PRINCE\'S INITIATIVE; SHARON HAD </p><p>KILLED IT TWO DAYS LATER. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>ASAD: WE ARE THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) ASAD AGREED THAT SYRIA\'S ROLE IN THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>WAS KEY, SINCE \'IF SYRIA IS NOT A PARTY TO THE PEACE PROCESS, </p><p>WHO IS?\'  EGYPT AND JORDAN HAVE ALREADY SIGNED AGREEMENTS: </p><p>SYRIA IS THE WHOLE PARTY, AND OTHERS SHOULD PLAY A SUPPORTING </p><p>ROLE.  ASAD IN TURN ASKED PRICE HOW THE US ADMINISTRATION </p><p>COULD ANNOUNCE THAT THEY WERE SENDING PEOPLE TO THE REGION TO </p><p>DISCUSS PEACE, AND HAVE THESE PEOPLE AVOID SYRIA. </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) IN CLOSING, ASAD SAID HE WAS PLEASED WITH THIS </p><p>DIALOGUE AND WITH CONGRESSMAN PRICE\'S COMMENTS.  HE ASKED </p><p>CONGRESSMAN PRICE TO SEND HIS BEST REGARDS TO PRESIDENT BUSH. </p><p> </p><p>27. (U) THIS CABLE WAS NOT CLEARED WITH CONGRESSMAN PRICE. </p><p> </p><p>28. (C) COMMENTS: ASAD SEEMED RELAXED AND A BIT MORE </p><p>REFLECTIVE THAN IN SOME OTHER MEETINGS.  FOR ONCE, HE DID </p><p>IMPLICITLY CLAIM TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.  MUCH OF WHAT HE </p><p>SAID WE\'VE ALREADY HEARD: CHASTISING THE US FOR ITS PERCEIVED </p><p>ABSENCE; CALLING FOR GREATER BILATERAL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION; DECRYING SHARON\'S TOXIC EFFECT ON THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS; AND CRITICIZING US PLANS TO \'BRING DOWN\' SADDAM. </p><p>NEW, ALTHOUGH EXPECTED, WAS HIS SKEPTICISM TOWARDS A PROPOSED </p><p>SUMMER PEACE CONFERENCE AND HIS RELUCTANCE TO CONSIDER A </p><p>LETTER OF SUPPORT TO PRESIDENT BUSH.  CONCERNING THE </p><p>SHARON-ARAFAT STRUGGLE, HE SEEMED AT A GENUINE LOSS AS TO </p><p>WHAT MIGHT COME NEXT, ALTHOUGH RELATIVELY SURE THAT, GIVEN </p><p>ARAFAT\'S IMPOTENCE AND POPULAR PALESTINIAN RAGE, IT WOULD NOT </p><p>BE GOOD.  WE TAKE ASAD AT HIS WORD THAT GIVEN THE ENFLAMED </p><p>AND DYNAMIC REGIONAL SITUATION, SYRIAN POLICY WILL MOVE </p><p>TOWARD ITS TRADITIONAL DEFAULT OF \'WAITING,\' WHILE PLAYING TO </p><p>THE ARAB STREET.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KATTOUF </p><p></p></div>
