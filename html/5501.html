<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000886 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR FROM AMBASSADOR </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR E, EB, AND EUR </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETRD, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR TREASURY U/S TAYLOR\'S VISIT TO </p><p>TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) You will arrive one day ahead of the Turkish </p><p>Parliament\'s debate over deployment of a number of U.S. </p><p>troops for site preparation, and less than two weeks before </p><p>Parliament\'s expected debate on deployment of U.S. combat </p><p>troops.  Your visit can help us achieve the best possible </p><p>outcome in Parliament by producing agreement on a bilateral </p><p>financial assistance package and outlining significant new </p><p>U.S. steps on trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On financial assistance, we will need to push hard </p><p>to reach agreement on numbers and basic structure.  The Turks </p><p>have said they want to conclude an MOU or other "letter or </p><p>intent" demonstrating that agreement.  In our view, that will </p><p>require maximum flexibility on numbers from our side.  You </p><p>will also want to stress the military and economic conditions </p><p>attached to our assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On trade, it is critical that you be able to present </p><p>a substantial package, including a commitment to submit </p><p>"clean" QIZ legislation to Congress, the most forward-leaning </p><p>language possible on additional GSP benefits (including a </p><p>firm commitment on gold jewelry), and textile quota shifts, </p><p>as well as the 807/809 program.  It would also be useful to </p><p>reiterate our willingness to consider an FTA if the GOT </p><p>confirms it is willing and able to pursue a comprehensive </p><p>agreement within the parameters of its Customs Union with the </p><p>EU.  Offering something substantive on trade is essential in </p><p>the Turkish political context. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) I hope you will also be able to give the Turks a </p><p>status report on the other elements of our economic package: </p><p>procurement and oil.  I understand there has been little </p><p>progress on the latter, but it would be useful to emphasize </p><p>to the GOT that rapid decisions on site preparation, troop </p><p>deployment and opening the border to humanitarian NGOs would </p><p>enable the USG to begin spending significant sums of money in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) On economic reform, the government has taken some </p><p>positive fiscal measures recently, in response to strong </p><p>IFI/USG pressure and concern in the markets.  Still, the </p><p>program remains off-track, and the government has yet to </p><p>convince us, the IMF, or the markets that it is serious about </p><p>reform (though the markets remain somewhat buoyed by the </p><p>expectation of bilateral U.S. asssitance).  The IMF and the </p><p>GOT are at loggerheads, with the Fund unhappy with many of </p><p>the government\'s economic decisions and its failure to </p><p>consult with Fund staff.  The Fund and the GOT are far apart </p><p>on the budget (IMF ResRep advised today that they see a gap </p><p>equal to 2 percent of GNP), on resolution of Yapi Kredi and </p><p>Pamukbank, and on several structural reform measures.  We are </p><p>seeking meetings for you with the Prime Minister, Deputy PM </p><p>Sener, and other top economic officials, which will be </p><p>opportunities for you to reiterate the importance of reform </p><p>and the link between our assistance package and </p><p>implementation of the IMF-backed program. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
