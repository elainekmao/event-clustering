<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000407 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, HR, PBTS, PGOV, PREF, HR, PBTS, PGOV, PREF, PREL, PRELECON </p><p>SUBJECT: GOC MOVING FORWARD WITH DEMINING PREVLAKA </p><p>PENINSULA, MONTENEGRIN BORDER AREAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. WHILE THE GOC WILL COVER THE FULL COST OF DEMINING THE </p><p>PREVLAKA PENINSULA, IT IS SEEKING INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00407  01 OF 02  241640Z </p><p>DEMINING AREAS ON BOTH SIDES OF ITS BORDER WITH MONTENEGRO. </p><p>CROATIAN AUTHORITIES WANT TO BE ABLE TO TOUT PREVLAKA AS A </p><p>MAJOR TOURIST ATTACTION THIS SUMMER, AND SEE DEMINING AS A </p><p>KEY PART OF THIS EFFORT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GOC HAS BIG PLANS FOR PREVLAKA </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. AT THE INVITATION OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE CROATIAN MINE </p><p>ACTION CENTER (CROMAC), OTO JUNGWIRTH, WE TRAVELED ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 13 TO PREVLAKA AND OTHER AREAS ALONG THE CROATIAN </p><p>BORDER WITH MONTENEGRO TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANING OF THE </p><p>SCOPE OF THE MINE PROBLEM IN THE AREA.  UNTIL RECENTLY, THE </p><p>PENINSULA HAD BEEN OFF LIMITS, PART OF AN EXCLUSION ZONE OF </p><p>THE UN OBSERVER MISSION (UNMOP), WHICH SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS </p><p>IN DECEMBER.  CROATIAN AND MONTENEGRIN AUTHORITIES DESCRIBED </p><p>TO US EXTENSIVE COOPERATION THEY HAVE HAD ON A NUMBER OF </p><p>ISSUES THEY BOTH FACE IN DEVELOPING THE REGION POST UNMOP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BEFORE TRAVELING TO PREVLAKA, WE MET WITH HDZ MEMBER AND </p><p>COUNTY PREFECT OF DUBROVNIK, IVAN SPRLJE, WHO HAS POLITICAL </p><p>AUTHORITY OVER PREVLAKA.  SPRLJE TOLD US THAT PLANS WERE </p><p>ALREADY UNDERWAY TO ESTABLISH PREVLAKA AS A MAJOR TOURIST </p><p>ATTRACTION.  HE SAID THAT ONE ASPECT OF THE PLAN IS TO </p><p>CONVERT A HUGE PORTION OF THE PENISULA INTO A CAMP AREA FOR </p><p>TOURISTS.  IN ADDITION, THE GOC WILL BUILD AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>STUDENT CENTER ON PREVLAKA, WHICH WOULD BE THE LARGEST IN THE </p><p>REGION.  ALL OF THE FACILITIES WILL BE FOR PUBLIC USE AND </p><p>WOULD BE OPEN YEAR ROUND.  SINCE IT IS A STATE PROJECT, MUCH </p><p>OF THE FUNDING FOR DEMINING AND OTHER CONSTRUCTION WILL COME </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00407  01 OF 02  241640Z </p><p>FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  THE GOC HAS ALREADY ALLOCATED </p><p>OVER $2 MILLION FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS AND WORK HAS ALREADY </p><p>BEGUN TO ENHANCE ROADS AND WATER SUPPLY -- A LONGSTANDING </p><p>CONSTRAINT -- TO THE PENINSULA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SPRLJE SAID THE NUMBER OF MONTENEGRIN TOURISTS TO </p><p>DUBROVNIK WAS UP CONSIDERABLY SINCE UNMOP SHUT DOWN.  HIS </p><p>ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE POPULATION IN THE AREAS NEAR </p><p>THE BORDER WITH MONTENEGRO.  HE SPECULATED THAT MORE PEOPLE </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO THOSE AREAS ONCE GOOD RELATIONS HAVE </p><p>BEEN ESTABLISHED AMONG THE COMMUNITIES STRADDLING THE BORDER </p><p>AND THE LANDMINES HAVE BEEN REMOVED.  CURRENTLY, NO ONE WAS </p><p>LIVING ON PREVLAKA OR IN THE AREAS NEAR THE BORDER.  ONE MINE </p><p>INCIDENT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BORDER COULD CAUSE RELATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES TO NOSE DIVE.  SPRLJE VOICED HIS </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR U.S. INTEREST IN THE REGION AND POSSIBLE </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO DEMINING EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>EYEING THE TOURIST SEASON </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. ACCESS TO PREVLAKA IS RESTRICTED BY THE CROATIAN POLICE, </p><p>PER AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE TWO SIDES WHEN UNMOP\'S CLOSURE </p><p>WAS BEING DISCUSSED.  DEMINING EFFORTS, HOWEVER, ARE ALREADY </p><p>UNDERWAY.  CROMAC OFFICIALS TOLD US THAT THE PENINSULA </p><p>CONSISTED OF ALMOST ONE MILLION SQUARE METERS OF LAND, ALL OF </p><p>WHICH HAD TO BE EXAMINED FOR MINES.  SO FAR, ONE-THIRD OF THE </p><p>LAND HAD BEEN CLEARED.  THEY SPECULATED THAT THE REMAINING </p><p>AREAS WILL BE COMPLETED BY JUNE.  THE GOC WANTED TO SPEED UP </p><p>THE INTEGRATION OF THE PENINSULA AS PART OF CROATIAN </p><p>TERRITORY AND TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS STABILITY ON ITS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00407  01 OF 02  241640Z </p><p>SOUTHERN FLANK.  ALSO, THE GOC IS SEEKING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF THE UPCOMING TOURIST SEASON BY HAVING PREVLAKA OPEN TO </p><p>TOURISTS IN JULY. </p><p> </p><p>6. CROATIAN AND MONTENEGRIN AUTHORITIES ARE COOPERATING IN </p><p>IDENTIFICATION OF SUSPECTED MINE SITES NEAR THE BORDER.  SO </p><p>FAR THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THREE AREAS AND HAVE DEVELOPED JOINT </p><p>DEMINING PROJECTS FOR EACH OF THEM.  ONE AREA IS ON THE </p><p>OUTSKIRTS OF PREVLAKA, WHILE THE OTHER TWO AREAS ARE ON THE </p><p>MONTENEGRIN SIDE OF THE BORDER.  EACH PROJECT CONSISTS OF </p><p>ABOUT 100,000 SQUARE METERS.  ONCE THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN </p><p>COMPLETED, AUTHORITIES TOLD US, THE ENTIRE AREA STRADDLING </p><p>THE BORDER WILL BE MINE FREE.  THE CROATIAN AND MONTENEGRIN </p><p>GOVERNMENTS ARE SEEKING INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP </p><p>FINANCE THE PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  RELATIONS BETWEEN MONTENEGRINS AND CROATIANS, BITTER FOR </p><p>OVER A DECADE, ARE ON THE MEND, AND COOPERATION ON DEMINING </p><p>HAS HELPED IMPROVE THE CLIMATE EVEN FURTHER.  WHILE ON THIS </p><p>VISIT THERE WAS NO FORMAL PITCH FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SUPPORT, </p><p>WE WILL SEEK TO LEND OUR SUPPORT IN THIS EFFORT WHERE </p><p>POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1648 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00407  02 OF 02  241640Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /007W </p><p>                  ------------------3A9044  241640Z /38 </p><p>O 241635Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9527 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000407 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, HR, PBTS, PGOV, PREF, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: GOC MOVING FORWARD WITH DEMINING PREVLAKA </p><p>PENINSULA, MONTENEGRIN BORDER AREAS </p><p> </p><p>8.
