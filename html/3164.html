<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, June 19, highlights </p><p>reports about yesterday\'s suicide bus bombing in </p><p>Jerusalem.  Headlines refer to it as "the Jerusalem </p><p>operation".  Reports also focus on Israel\'s decision </p><p>to retaliate in Palestinian Authority areas. </p><p>Editorial commentaries continue to criticize Israel\'s </p><p>occupation and its aggression against the Palestinian </p><p>people.  One columnist today holds the United States </p><p>"fully responsible" for the destruction and </p><p>assassinations taking place in the Palestinian </p><p>territories. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Giving Sharon the excuse!" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Yaser Za\'atreh writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al- </p><p>Dustour (06/19):  "They said that the heroic Jerusalem </p><p>operation is going to give Sharon the excuse he needs </p><p>to escalate his aggressions against the Palestinians </p><p>people.  Yet, the Palestinians wonder when did Sharon </p><p>stop those aggressions in the first place.  Giving in </p><p>to Sharon\'s security and then political conditions is </p><p>the only guaranteed way to stop the aggressions </p><p>against the Palestinian people.  However, it is a way </p><p>that is not acceptable to the principles, values, </p><p>dignity and pride know to all free people.  The heroic </p><p>Jerusalem operation and operations before it fall </p><p>within the category of resistance, combating </p><p>occupation and convincing the whole world that ending </p><p>the occupation is the only solution.  The Palestinian </p><p>people and their leadership are being humiliated, and </p><p>there is no response to that other than continuing the </p><p>resistance." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Will the Israeli ever learn the lesson?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>906/19):  "Yesterday\'s operation in Jerusalem says it </p><p>all about the effectiveness of the dividing wall that </p><p>Sharon is building.  Insisting on dealing with the </p><p>Palestinian people with brutality, oppression and </p><p>humiliation has only succeeded in entrenching the </p><p>anger and the rage and the willingness to die, so that </p><p>more and more young men ready for martyrdom </p><p>operations." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The American green light" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i </p><p>(06/19):  "Bush is the one asking the Arabs and the </p><p>Palestinians to bear their responsibilities so that </p><p>his vision of the Palestinian state can come into </p><p>reality.  Israel is never asked to do anything.  It is </p><p>doing more than its share.  Even more than that, </p><p>Sharon is a man of peace according to Bush, and Arafat </p><p>is a terrorist.  This sums up America\'s vision and its </p><p>policies towards this region.  Saying that American </p><p>gives Sharon the green light to act is actually </p><p>belittling American\'s role in the events of the </p><p>Israeli aggression.  In fact, American is not only </p><p>allowing Sharon to do what he sees fit, but is also </p><p>instigating him, arming him, financing him and </p><p>providing him with a moral and legal cover in order to </p><p>protect him from the United Nations and the world. </p><p>America bears full responsibility for what is </p><p>happening in the West Bank." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
