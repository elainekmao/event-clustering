<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOGADISHU 10969 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, PGOV, PINS, SO </p><p>SUBJECT:  CONSTITUTION DRAFTER DISILLUSIONED </p><p> </p><p>REF:  MOGADISHU 09743 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2.  ON DECEMBER 17, POLOFF SPOKE WITH ABDULAHI </p><p>MOALLIM, A HAWIYE LAWYER SPECIALIZING IN HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ISSUES.  MOALLIM WAS ONE OF THE SIX DRAFTERS </p><p>OF THE NEW SOMALI CONSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3.  MOALLIM SAID HE WAS DISILLUSIONED BY THE GSDR\'S LACK </p><p>OF RESPECT FOR THE CONSTITUTION, AND LISTED 13 </p><p>VIOLATIONS, INCLUDING ILLEGAL ARRESTS, PROPERTY </p><p>SEIZURES, AND KILLINGS, OF ITS TERMS SINCE ITS </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION.  MOALLIM ALSO CALLED THE NEW </p><p>SECURITY DECREE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND MAINTAINED </p><p>THAT ITS ISSUANCE WAS A MISUSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>PROVISION ALLOWING PRESIDENTIAL DECREES.  THESE </p><p>SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR "TRUE EMERGENCIES," HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE WOULD STILL BE WILLING </p><p>TO SERVE ON THE GSDR DELEGATION TO ROUND TABLE TALKS </p><p>WITH THE OPPOSITION, WERE THESE TO BE RESCHEDULED, </p><p>MOALLIM CLAIMED HE HAD NEVER BEEN WILLING TO SIT ON </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S SIDE.  HIS NAME HAD BEEN PUT ON THE </p><p>LIST WITHOUT HIS BEING ASKED. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  NEVERTHELESS, MOALLIM CONTINUED, HE BELIEVED THAT </p><p>TALKS BETWEEN THE GSDR AND ITS OPPONENTS HAD SOME </p><p>CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING AND WERE THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID </p><p>A VIOLENT END TO THE SIAD REGIME.  HE BELIEVED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THE EGYPTIAN AND ITALIAN GOVERNMENTS WERE FED UP </p><p>WITH SIAD\'S TERGIVERSATIONS AND DOUBTED THEY WOULD BE </p><p>WILLING TO RESCHEDULE THE ROUND TABLE TALKS.  NOBODY </p><p>TRUSTS SIAD, HE SAID, AND RECONCILIATION IS UNLIKELY </p><p>TO TAKE PLACE UNTIL SIAD RESIGNS, A STEP MOALLIM </p><p>BELIEVES SIAD WILL BE COMPELLED TO TAKE. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  COMMENT.  MOALLIM\'S GLOOM REGARDING THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION AND PEACEFUL RECONCILIATION IS </p><p>REMARKABLE BECAUSE, SIX WEEKS AGO, HE WAS THE </p><p>MOST OPTIMISTIC OF THE EMBASSY\'S CONTACTS </p><p>(REFTEL).  HIS CONTINUED BELIEF IN THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>OF A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO SOMALIA\'S POLITICAL </p><p>CRISIS STILL SHOWS HIM TO BE MORE SANGUINE THAN </p><p>MOST OF OUR OTHER CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7.  ALL PARTIES SEEM TO WANT TO CLAIM MOALLIM FOR </p><p>THEIR SIDE.  IN ADDITION TO BEING ADDED TO THE </p><p>GSDR DELEGATION WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION, MOALLIM </p><p>EARLIER THIS YEAR WAS FALSELY LISTED AS A SIGNER </p><p>OF THE MAY MANIFESTO.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BISHOP </p><p></p></div>
