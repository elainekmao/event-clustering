<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002472 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NEA FOR BURNS, SATTERFIELD, AND HALE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IT, PREL, KPAL, EAID, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN CONFERENCE ON PALESTINIAN REFORMS AND </p><p>ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 1960 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: The MFA organized a conference on "The </p><p>Palestinian Future: Reforms and Economic Reconstruction" in </p><p>Rome May 28-29.  As the MFA told us and the Embassy of Israel </p><p>prior to the conference, this was not a political conference </p><p>about roadmap implementation but was intended largely for </p><p>Italian public opinion and as a preparation for Italy\'s </p><p>presidency of the EU (reftel).  Key speakers included FM </p><p>Frattini, Italian Minister for Productive Activities Antonio </p><p>Marzano, Palestinian Minister of the Economy Maher Al-Masri, </p><p>EU Special Envoy for the Middle East Miguel Angel Moratinos, </p><p>UN Special Envoy for the Middle East Terje Roed Larsen, and </p><p>Russian Special Envoy for the Middle East Andrej Vdovin. </p><p>David Hale, Office Director for NEA/IAI, represented the USG </p><p>on behalf of NEA A/S Burns.  All speakers agreed on the </p><p>importance of seezing the current momentum to implement the </p><p>roadmap and end the cycle of violence and on the need to </p><p>improve the economic conditions of Palestinians.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) May 28 focused on the reform of the Palestinian </p><p>National Authority within the roadmap.  FM Frattini </p><p>underlined that institutional reform and economic </p><p>reconstruction are closely linked and that institutional </p><p>reform in Palestine is a prerequisite for a free </p><p>market-oriented economy.  Moratinos said that the roadmap is </p><p>more promising than previous peace initiatives because it </p><p>clearly outlined the end goal (a Palestinian state) and </p><p>called for an international monitoring mechanism.  Vdovin </p><p>praised the President\'s personal commitment to the MEPP, the </p><p>Quartet as a mechanism that enables cooperation and not </p><p>competition among the US, EU, UN, and Russia, the new </p><p>Palestinian government headed by Abu Mazen, and Israel\'s </p><p>acceptance of the roadmap.  Hale underlined the depth of the </p><p>President\'s commitment to do all he could to move forward </p><p>implementation of the roadmap and to help the parties fulfill </p><p>the two-state vision.  He calls on the parties to do their </p><p>parts: the Palestinians to end violence and terrorism, the </p><p>Israelis to ease the humanitarian crisis in the West Bank and </p><p>Gaza, and the Arab partners to end all ties to terrorism and </p><p>prepare their publics to accept the state of Israel and the </p><p>two state solution. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) May 29 focused on the reconstruction of the </p><p>Palestinian economy. Al-Masri described the state of the </p><p>Palestinian economy (60% poverty rate, 45% unemployment, and </p><p>a 60% drop in the GDP in the past 2 years).  He mentioned </p><p>consolidating all revenues, focusing expenditures only on PA </p><p>related activities, and submitting quarterly financial </p><p>statements to the legislative council as important reform </p><p>steps conducted by his ministry.  He said that the private </p><p>sector was the backbone of the Palestinian economy, and that </p><p>the Palestinians needed the Israeli market to sell their </p><p>goods given that their domestic market was too small.  He </p><p>emphasized the importance of attracting international </p><p>investment to the territories but was realistic by saying </p><p>that this would not happen until there is security in the </p><p>area.  Larsen echoed what Al-Masri said by stating that, </p><p>despite being optimistic about the holistic approach of the </p><p>roadmap, he did not consider the current environment in the </p><p>Middle East condusive to economic development. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S "MARSHALL PLAN" </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Palestinian Representative in Italy, Nemer </p><p>Hamad, criticized the Italian government for its inaction on </p><p>Berlusconi\'s idea of a Marshall Plan type of aid package to </p><p>help the Palestinian economy.  Ambassador Badini, the MFA\'s </p><p>DG for the Middle East, responded by saying that the idea of </p><p>a "Marshall Plan" for the Palestinian economy was not dead </p><p>but that it had no EU consensus.  He reminded that the </p><p>Marshall Plan to Europe was done after WWII ended because an </p><p>economic intervention of that scale was not possible before </p><p>there was peace.  Marzano said that Italy could transfer some </p><p>of its best practices to the Palestinians in a way that would </p><p>best fit their economy, mostly in the fields of water </p><p>management and small/medium size enterprises, where Italy had </p><p>a large expertise.  Ilan Baruch, the Israeli MFA\'s Deputy </p><p>Director General for Economic Affairs, said that, security </p><p>situation permitting, Israel was open-minded about reviving </p><p>multilaterals and industrial zones and readmitting </p><p>Palestinian workers in Israel to help revive the Palestinian </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>economy. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: While not breaking any new ground, this </p><p>conference was a useful reminder for Italian public opinion </p><p>of the importance the GOI places on solving conflicts in the </p><p>region and that the MEPP will be one of Italy\'s top priority </p><p>during its fast-approaching EU presidency.  The Israeli </p><p>Ambassador in Rome, who originally had serious reservations </p><p>about this conference (reftel), actually attended parts of </p><p>it.  The Italian government and Embassy Rome both greatly </p><p>appreciated the participation of David Hale in the </p><p>conference.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) This cable was cleared by NEA/IAI Director David Hale. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02472 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
