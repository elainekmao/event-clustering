<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 001265 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR BCLTV ALLAN LANGLAND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, VN </p><p>SUBJECT: HCMC PARTY COMMISSION ON IDEOLOGY AND CULTURE FAVORS FOREIGN INVESTMENT </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) SUMMARY:  CONSUL GENERAL PAID A COURTESY CALL </p><p>NOVEMBER 6 ON MS. PHAM PHUONG THAO, HEAD OF THE HO CHI </p><p>MINH CITY PARTY COMMISSION ON IDEOLOGY AND CULTURE.  IN </p><p>A CORDIAL MEETING, PHAM EXPLAINED SHE DEALS WITH A VERY </p><p>BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES, INCLUDING URBAN PLANNING.  SHE </p><p>SPOKE AT LENGTH ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTRACTING FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTMENT TO HCMC AND ON THE PROBLEMS FLOWING FROM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01265  01 OF 02  102301Z </p><p>INTERNAL MIGRATION.  SHE ALSO EXPLAINED HOW THE </p><p>COMMISSION CHECKS THE MEDIA TO ENSURE ITS CONTENT FITS </p><p>PARTY POLICIES, ALTHOUGH SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM IS </p><p>PERMITTED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) FOREIGN INVESTMENT:  PHAM EMPHASIZED HCMC\'S </p><p>IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ROLE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF </p><p>VIETNAM.  SHE SAID FOREIGN INVESTMENT HAS ALREADY HAD A </p><p>POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE CITY AND SURROUNDING PROVINCES, </p><p>INCREASING BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND AVAILABLE SERVICES. </p><p>SHE BELIEVES LOCAL AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN </p><p>TRANSPORTATION, EDUCATION, MEDICINE, MEDIA AND CULTURE </p><p>IS CRUCIAL TO BOTH THE CITY\'S DEVELOPMENT AND ITS </p><p>EFFORTS TO COMBAT SOCIAL PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) PHAM WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE MANY NEW BUSINESSES </p><p>THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN HCMC AND WANTS MORE.  SHE </p><p>NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH 5,000 BUSINESSES HAD BEEN </p><p>ESTABLISHED IN THE PAST YEAR IN HCMC, SOME 3,000 </p><p>BUSINESSES HAVE CLOSED.  INJECTING A BIT OF HUMOR INTO </p><p>THE PROCEEDINGS, PHAM SAID SHE WAS COMMITTED TO THE </p><p>MARKET SYSTEM OF ECONOMICS, BUT IT WOULD BE NICER TO </p><p>SEE A "BETTER RATIO OF BUSINESS START-UPS TO BUSINESS </p><p>FAILURES." </p><p> </p><p>4.(U) INTERNAL MIGRATION:  PHAM HIGHLIGHTED INTERNAL </p><p>MIGRATION AS A MAJOR FACTOR IN HCMC\'S RAPID GROWTH. </p><p>RURAL MIGRANTS TO HCMC PRIMARILY COME IN SEARCH OF </p><p>BETTER PAYING JOBS, WITH SALARIES FOR THE MENIAL JOBS </p><p>THEY FIND GENERALLY RANGING BETWEEN 40 TO 60 USD PER </p><p>MONTH.  BUT HCMC IS SEEING SOME CITY RESIDENTS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01265  01 OF 02  102301Z </p><p>MIGRATING TO NEIGHBORING PROVINCES.  THIS OUT-MIGRATION </p><p>IS DRIVEN BY THE DESIRE FOR HIGHER PAYING FACTORY JOBS, </p><p>WITH SALARIES AVERAGING 100 USD PER MONTH.  PHAM SAW </p><p>THIS OUTFLOW OF WELL-EDUCATED PEOPLE AS A PROBLEM, AND </p><p>SAID FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO BUILD ADDITIONAL FACTORIES </p><p>IN HCMC WOULD HELP COMBAT THIS. </p><p> </p><p>5.(U) MIGRATION ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO SOCIAL PROBLEMS </p><p>SUCH AS PROSTITUTION AND BEGGING.  PHAM STATED THAT </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN HCMC BUSINESSES IS KEY TO HELPING </p><p>ALLEVIATE THESE SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  SHE BELIEVES FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTMENT WILL HELP PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE OTHERWISE RELYING ON THESE </p><p>ACTIVITIES FOR THEIR INCOME. </p><p> </p><p>6.(U) MASS TRANSIT:  PHAM STATED THAT THE CITY </p><p>DESPERATELY NEEDS A MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM, EMPHASIZING </p><p>THE ROLE FOREIGN INVESTMENT COULD PLAY IN ITS CREATION. </p><p>SHE URGED U.S. BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN MASS TRANSIT FOR </p><p>HCMC.  AT A MINIMUM, PHAM BELIEVES HCMC NEEDS TWO MASS </p><p>TRANSIT CORRIDORS (NORTH-SOUTH AND EAST-WEST). IN </p><p>ADDITION TO MASS TRANSIT, ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING </p><p>TRAFFIC LAWS IS KEY TO MANAGING HCMC\'S TRANSPORTATION </p><p>PROBLEMS.  PHAM HIGHLIGHTED THE CURRENT EFFORT TO TEACH </p><p>DRIVERS IN HCMC TO FOLLOW BASIC TRAFFIC RULES, CALLING </p><p>IT AN "IMMENSE TASK".  SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS </p><p>PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORT -- ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED TO LAST </p><p>ONE YEAR -- MIGHT HAVE TO BE EXTENDED IN ORDER TO </p><p>PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.(U) MEDIA CONTROLS:  ANOTHER ASPECT OF HCMC\'S ROLE IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01265  01 OF 02  102301Z </p><p>THE SOUTHERN PART OF VIETNAM IS ITS FUNCTION AS A </p><p>CENTER FOR INFORMATION AND THE MEDIA.  PHAM SAID PEOPLE </p><p>IN HCMC ARE "THIRSTY" FOR NEWS - DOMESTIC AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL.  IN HER POSITION AS HEAD OF THE HCMC </p><p>PARTY COMMISSION ON IDEOLOGY AND CULTURE, PHAM IS </p><p>INSTRUMENTAL IN SETTING THE POLICY AND REGULATIONS THAT </p><p>GOVERN THE MEDIA HERE.  SHE SAID THE DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>CULTURE AND INFORMATION IS TASKED WITH IMPLEMENTING </p><p>THIS POLICY.  PRINT MEDIA IN HCMC SUBMIT A COPY OF </p><p>THEIR PUBLICATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CULTURE AND </p><p>INFORMATION, WHERE IT IS EVALUATED IN LIGHT OF THE </p><p>POLICY AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE PARTY </p><p>COMMISSION.  IF THE MATERIAL FAILS THE EVALUATION, IT </p><p>CANNOT BE PUBLISHED.  (COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH CERTAIN TYPES </p><p>OF CRITICISM ARE ACCEPTED BY THE GVN, THE PRINT MEDIA </p><p>PRACTICES SELF-CENSORSHIP TO AVOID PROBLEMS WITH EITHER </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT OF CULTURE AND INFORMATION OR THE PARTY </p><p>COMMISSION.) </p><p> </p><p>8.(U) CG ASKED PHAM ABOUT THE MEDIA\'S FREEDOM OF </p><p>EXPRESSION, ESPECIALLY RELATING TO EDITORIALS.  CG ALSO </p><p>INQUIRED HOW FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS COULD BEST ASK FOR </p><p>CORRECTIONS IN ARTICLES OR COMMENTARY THAT DO NOT </p><p>ACCURATELY REFLECT THE FACTS OR THEIR VIEWS.  PHAM </p><p>REPLIED THAT THE HCMC MEDIA SOMETIMES PROVIDE </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM THAT STRENGTHENS THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  SUCH CRITICISM HAS SOMETIMES LED TO THE </p><p>GVN IMPLEMENTING DIFFERENT PROPOSALS.  HOWEVER, SHE </p><p>ALSO NOTED THAT SOMETIMES THE MEDIA DO NOT HAVE ALL THE </p><p>FACTS ABOUT A CASE.  IN THOSE INSTANCES, THE LOCAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01265  02 OF 02  102301Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT INVOLVED COMMUNICATES WITH THE MEDIA IN HCMC </p><p>AND INFORMS THEM OF THEIR MISTAKES.  THE MEDIA THEN </p><p>AMEND THEIR STATEMENTS AND PUBLISH THE CORRECT </p><p>INFORMATION.  LIKEWISE, SOMETIMES THE MEDIA DO NOT HAVE </p><p>ALL THE FACTS ABOUT EVENTS OR POLICIES IN FOREIGN </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THE LOCAL MEDIA ARE AWARE OF THIS, AND THE </p><p>COMMISSION URGES THEM TO BE OPEN TO MORE SOURCES OF </p><p>INFORMATION.  CG STATED SHE WOULD TAKE UP THAT OFFER </p><p>AND WOULD PROVIDE REPORTERS WITH ACCURATE INFORMATION </p><p>ABOUT U.S. EVENTS/POLICIES.  THE MEETING CONCLUDED WITH </p><p>BOTH PHAM AND THE CG EXPRESSING THEIR COMMITMENT TO </p><p>CONTINUED OPENNESS AND ACCESSIBILITY. </p><p> </p><p>9.(U) COMMENT:  PHAM WAS NOTABLE FOR HER IMPRESSIVE </p><p>COMMAND OF THE FACTS UNDERLYING HER BROAD AREAS OF </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY.  SHE SPOKE VERY SOFTLY, BUT WITH A </p><p>RAPID-FIRE DELIVERY, LISTING STATISTICS FROM MEMORY TO </p><p>SUPPORT HER STATEMENTS IN ALL SUBJECT AREAS.  HER </p><p>MANNER REMAINED FRIENDLY THROUGHOUT, INCLUDING WHEN </p><p>MORE SENSITIVE AREAS WERE BROACHED.  THE IMPRESSION SHE </p><p>LEFT IS THAT THE PARTY COMMISSION ON IDEOLOGY AND </p><p>CULTURE REACHES BEYOND ITS NAME, TOUCHING MANY ASPECTS </p><p>OF LIFE IN HCMC -- INCLUDING THE PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF </p><p>URBAN PLANNING.  END COMMENT.   YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
