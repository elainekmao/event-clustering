<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002378 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: EX-FINANCE CHIEF MAKONI\'S DIM VIEW OF ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Economic section chief William Weissman. </p><p>Reason: 1.5b/d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Ex-Finance Minister Simba Makoni fears </p><p>thousands of Zimbabweans will soon suffer worsening effects </p><p>of malnutrition due to lack of food and adequate transport </p><p>logistics.  He feels that Zimbabwe would have to undergo </p><p>change "from within or from outside" to get its economy back </p><p>on track.  However, he believes President Mugabe feels too </p><p>threatened by opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) </p><p>inroads to compromise on key issues, and cabinet ministers </p><p>are too cowed by the President to challenge official dogma. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>A lonely voice of dissent </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) During his 2-year tenure as Finance Minister ending in </p><p>August, Makoni was a rare GoZ higher-up calling for an end to </p><p>disastrous economic policies, such as the official exchange </p><p>rate, overspending, price controls and costly military </p><p>intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Thus many </p><p>in Zimbabwe\'s business and donor communities saw Makoni as </p><p>the last hope for a return to economic normalcy.  In a </p><p>meeting with Ambassador Sullivan and econoff, he reiterated </p><p>support for rationalizing monetary and fiscal policies, but </p><p>cautioned that these actions would exacerbate suffering in </p><p>the short-run.  However, he believed the GoZ could level with </p><p>its population, explaining that this was the only way to </p><p>avert an inevitable economic meltdown.  While still in office </p><p>in June, he projected that the country would need 24-36 </p><p>months to regain 1997 levels; he now thinks that theoretical </p><p>recovery period is even more elusive. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In cabinet meetings, Makoni was often a lone detractor </p><p>from President Mugabe\'s line. He found this especially </p><p>disheartening because he knew 16 of 20 participants sided </p><p>with him, and many egged him on during breaks.  Makoni said </p><p>ministers advocate policy that they believe Mugabe wants </p><p>rather than what works.  "It all depends upon what the old </p><p>man says," he said.  The President would be more amenable to </p><p>compromise if the opposition MDC presented a less apparent </p><p>threat, a fact he characterized as regrettable.  In the end, </p><p>Makoni feels Zimbabwe will probably only reverse course under </p><p>a new government.  Makoni also believed the economic crisis </p><p>could only be resolved when the country\'s political crisis </p><p>was addressed. </p><p> </p><p>A pessimistic view of food, HIV, land redistribution </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>4. (C) Makoni offered his take on additional crises: </p><p> </p><p>- Food. He recalled being rebuked in the cabinet for </p><p>forecasting shortages and seeking international assistance. </p><p>He considers the National Railway of Zimbabwe (NRZ) unsuited </p><p>to move large quantities of food.  At one point, he rejected </p><p>NRZ requests for US$ 22 million in imported parts and about </p><p>US$ 50 million in rolling stock because he considered the </p><p>railway management inept.  He worries that thousands of </p><p>Zimbabweans might die of malnutrition in the coming months. </p><p> </p><p>- HIV/AIDS. Makoni speculated that each extended Zimbabwean </p><p>family is touched by an AIDS death each week, and he </p><p>recounted that 6 workers on his own farm have died of AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>- Land Redistribution.  He suggested sardonically that </p><p>Zimbabwe has "progressed" from a country where a few whites </p><p>own the land to a country where a few blacks control it, with </p><p>the peasant masses remaining poor and landless. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (C) Makoni\'s unsuccessful tenure as Finance Minister </p><p>demonstrates that the Mugabe government allows little space </p><p>for dissent.  Encircled by zealots and yes-men, Mugabe shows </p><p>no sign of moving toward conventional macroeconomic policies. </p><p> Gaps are meanwhile widening between revenue and expenditure, </p><p>street and controlled prices, and parallel and official </p><p>exchange rates - signs that the needed medicine Makoni </p><p>prescribed will taste even more bitter when the GoZ one day </p><p>reconciles these contradictions and rejoins the rational </p><p>world. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
