<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008564 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH BROADCASTING BOARD LIFTS SOME RESTRICTIONS </p><p>ON KURDISH BROADCASTS -- BUT EU UNDERWHELMED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 7290 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 8535 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 6904 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 6116 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. Kass. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Turkey\'s High Radio and Television Board </p><p>(RTUK) enacts a regulation lifting some restrictions on TV </p><p>and radio broadcasts in Kurdish -- but only on state-owned </p><p>stations and under strict time limits.  EU representatives in </p><p>Ankara said the limited regulation will not bolster Turkey\'s </p><p>EU bid.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The RTUK announced November 20 -- two days after the </p><p>new AK Government assumed power -- that it had implemented </p><p>regulations, pursuant to laws passed by the previous </p><p>Parliament, allowing broadcasts in Kurdish and other </p><p>non-Turkish languages traditionally used by Turkish citizens. </p><p> The regulation sets the following restrictions: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Non-Turkish broadcasts are permitted only on state-owned </p><p>media outlets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- TV broadcasts will be limited to 30 minutes per day, two </p><p>hours per week; radio broadcasts will be limited to 45 </p><p>minutes per day, four hours per week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Non-Turkish TV broadcasts must have Turkish subtitles, and </p><p>non-Turkish radio broadcasts must be followed by the same </p><p>program in Turkish. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Broadcasts aimed at teaching non-Turkish languages are </p><p>prohibited. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The broadcasting measure completes the previous GOT\'s </p><p>efforts to adopt regulations implementing the August </p><p>EU-related legislative reform package (refs A,C,D).  However, </p><p>Ankara-based EU and EU member state representatives are </p><p>criticizing the RTUK measure\'s restrictions -- as are local </p><p>human rights and pro Kurdish groups.  They also predict that </p><p>what they describe as such half-hearted measures will not </p><p>bolster Turkey\'s EU candidacy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Luigi Narbone, second in command at the EU office in </p><p>Ankara, told Poloff the GOT in the past had indicated to EU </p><p>officials it would adopt a more open approach to non-Turkish </p><p>broadcasting.  He said the limited regulation could fuel EU </p><p>skepticism about GOT reforms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A Danish diplomat also said he was disappointed with the </p><p>regulation, and expressed concern that publicity about the </p><p>restrictions could distract attention from positive </p><p>developments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A British diplomat said the regulation\'s shortcomings </p><p>would not be a major factor in EU thinking, but would give </p><p>ammunition to Turkey\'s EU critics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Euros Hoping AK Will Do Better </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Poloff urged the diplomats to view the RTUK measure as </p><p>an opening that can be exploited by a reform-minded </p><p>government -- noting that AK Party and government leaders are </p><p>signaling a desire to break new ground on human rights.  The </p><p>diplomats agreed.  Narbone noted that AK officials had </p><p>already told him they want to broaden the scope of </p><p>regulations on minority foundations (ref A), adding that he </p><p>hoped AK will take the same approach toward the broadcasting </p><p>regulation. (Note: Interior Minister Aksu issued a circular </p><p>Nov 21. encouraging strict protection of human rights -- ref </p><p>B.  End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The RTUK action is representative of the GOT\'s overall </p><p>reform efforts.  It is at the same time both a groundbreaking </p><p>advance and a maddening example of stubborn resistance to </p><p>change -- particularly among Establishment Kemalists, who </p><p>regard "pro-Kurdish" reform as a direct assault on Turkey\'s </p><p>identity and on their own primacy in the current scheme of </p><p>things.  Turkey has once again taken a step in the right </p><p>direction, but only a half step.  The U.S. and EU must </p><p>continue to reward these efforts while pressing the new AK </p><p>Government to continue down the path toward permanent, </p><p>fundamental reform.  AK\'s interest in changing the status quo </p><p>is a factor in favor of reform. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
