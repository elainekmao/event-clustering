O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: How fast can an economy recede? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Washington-based Zimbabwe watchers may have </p><p>noted that the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) recently </p><p>projected "only" a 9 percent decline for Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>fledging economy in 2003.  By contrast, most local </p><p>economists are predicting at least minus 12 percent and </p><p>even the GOZ -- which, we presume, believes in its </p><p>policies -- forecasts minus 7.2 percent.  We recently </p><p>asked Harare-based Guardian correspondent Andrew Meldrum, </p><p>who does much of the legwork for the EIU, about this </p><p>conservative outlook.  He told us the EIU simply does not </p><p>believe a peacetime economy, no matter how bad its </p><p>stewardship, can shrink by over 10 percent year after </p><p>year.  In spite of its own data, the EIU believes the </p><p>speed of Zimbabwe\'s freefall is now testing structural </p><p>limits. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Although there are historical parallels, </p><p>Zimbabwe has become a sort of laboratory for bad </p><p>macroeconomics.  Even if 9 percent is conservative, the </p><p>EIU still reckons that Zimbabwe will retain its standing </p><p>in 2003 as the world\'s worst performing economy. However, </p><p>the extent of recession will depend on whether the GOZ </p><p>modifies its heavy-handed interventionism.  If the GOZ </p><p>eliminates the official exchange rate, price controls and </p><p>export disincentives, the economy will perform </p><p>considerably better. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
