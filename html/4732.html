<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 003314 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>. </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT -- SHAUN LONERGAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, SNAR, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LAWS ENACTED BEFORE FATF DEADLINE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 3311 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is an action message; action request in para 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) During a December 14 emergency session, the Nigerian </p><p>Senate passed three pieces of money laundering legislation </p><p>and sent the bills to the President for signature.  President </p><p>Obasanjo signed the bills into law the same day, just prior </p><p>to the FATF deadline of December 15 for Nigeria to pass at </p><p>least an amendment to the 1995 Money Laundering Act. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) The version of the Money Laundering Act Amendment </p><p>approved by the Senate and signed into law restored customer </p><p>identification and cash transaction reporting thresholds </p><p>proposed by the Presidency and coordinated with the FATF.  On </p><p>November 27 the Senate raised the threshold requiring </p><p>financial institutions to identify their customers to USD </p><p>50,000 or "its equivalent in any foreign currency (appearing </p><p>to exclude transactions in Nigeria\'s currency, the Naira). </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s proposed threshold of USD 5,000 or its </p><p>equivalent in any currency was restored in the new law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Similarly, the Senate on November 27 raised the </p><p>threshold for requirements that financial institutions report </p><p>cash transactions to Naira five million (equivalent to USD </p><p>40,000) and ten million (equivalent to USD 80,000) for </p><p>individuals and corporate entities, respectively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) The Money Laundering Act amendment also expands the </p><p>scope of the law\'s coverage beyond the proceeds of drug </p><p>trafficking to the "proceeds of a crime or an illegal act" </p><p>and expands the scope of financial institutions covered under </p><p>the Act to include stock brokerage firms and money changing </p><p>establishments.  (Note: These changes were also encouraged by </p><p>the FATF. End Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) An amendment to the 1991 Banking and Other Financial </p><p>Institutions Act (BOFI) was enacted to give the Central Bank </p><p>of Nigeria expanded powers to deny licenses to financial </p><p>institutions and to freeze suspicious accounts.  The third </p><p>piece of legislation enacted December 14 is an entirely new </p><p>Act -- the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission </p><p>(Establishment) Act -- which creates a cental law enforcement </p><p>agency to coordinate the Federal Government\'s efforts to </p><p>investigate and prosecute money laundering and other </p><p>financial crimes.  This agency will also serve as a </p><p>clearinghouse for money laundering intelligence collected and </p><p>shared within the country and with international partners, </p><p>satisfying the FATF\'s call for a Financial Intelligence Unit </p><p>(FIU). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) According to President Obasanjo\'s Principal Secretary </p><p>Stephen Oronsaye, who attended the December 14 Senate session </p><p>to receive the bills for immediate signature by the </p><p>President, the bills have been faxed to the Chairman of the </p><p>FATF\'s Africa and Middle East Review Group (AMERG). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) Comment:  The GON\'s remarkable enactment of this </p><p>legislation during a holiday recess and an electoral season </p><p>marked by extreme tension between the Legislature and </p><p>Executive branches was made possible by a recognition among </p><p>all concerned that Nigeria as a whole stood to lose from </p><p>inaction.  This shows that, despite the many divisive forces </p><p>at play in the Nigerian body politic, policy-makers have the </p><p>ability to suppress individual interests and come together </p><p>around issues of national importance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) Action Request:  Upon U.S. Treasury\'s review of the </p><p>newly enacted legislation  -- particularly the Money </p><p>Laundering Act Amendment -- please confirm that these reforms </p><p>satisfy the FATF\'s requirements for the prevention of </p><p>counter-measures against Nigeria. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
