<p>UNCLAS ROME 000595 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB, DRL/IL AND EUR/WE </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/BRUMFIELD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ECON, EAID, PGOV, AF, IT, AFGHANISTAN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN UNION CONFEDERATION EAGER TO HELP PROMOTE </p><p>LABOR STANDARDS IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: KABUL 303 </p><p> </p><p>1.  NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THIS CABLE CONTAINS AN ACTION REQUEST FOR DRL/IL AND </p><p>SA/PAB; PLEASE SEE PARA 7. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT ARM OF ONE OF ITALY\'S </p><p>MAJOR LABOR CONFEDERATIONS (THE ITALIAN CONFEDERATION OF </p><p>LABOR UNIONS, OR CISL) IS SEEKING MODEST FUNDING ($300,000) </p><p>FROM THE ITALIAN MFA TO SUPPORT A CAPACITY-BUILDING PROJECT </p><p>UNDER WHICH THE CONFEDERATION WOULD PARTNER WITH AND HELP </p><p>DEVELOP AN AFGHAN MINISTRY OF LABOR.  OFFICIALS FROM ISCOS, </p><p>THE CISL\'S DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION, ORIGINALLY BRIEFED US </p><p>ON THEIR PROPOSAL IN LATE DECEMBER.  WHEN CONTACTED IN EARLY </p><p>FEBRUARY, THEY REITERATED THEY WERE STILL AWAITING A </p><p>DECISION FROM THE MFA; IN THE MEANTIME, THEY WERE </p><p>COORDINATING WITH THE ILO TO DEVELOP A SEPARATE PROPOSAL TO </p><p>HELP DEVELOP A NASCENT TRADE UNION MOVEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WITH 4.1 MILLION MEMBERS, THE CISL IS ITALY\'S SECOND- </p><p>LARGEST UNION CONFEDERATION; IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE </p><p>WITH DEVELOPMENT AND COOPERATION PROGRAMS.  IT ALREADY HAS </p><p>UNDERTAKEN SIMILAR CAPACITY-BUILDING PROJECTS WITH NASCENT </p><p>LABOR MINISTRIES IN MOZAMBIQUE, ERITREA AND BOSNIA.  ISCOS </p><p>HAS EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION, HAVING PARTNERED WITH THE </p><p>PAKISTANI LABOR FEDERATION TO DEVELOP TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR </p><p>AFGHAN REFUGEES (REPORTEDLY IN COOPERATION WITH USAID). </p><p>ISCOS ALSO HAS CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THE </p><p>SOLIDARITY CENTER, THE DEVELOPMENT AND ASSISTANCE ARM OF THE </p><p>AFL-CIO. </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE PROPOSED PROJECT, ISCOS WOULD INTER ALIA: </p><p>-- HELP THE MINISTRY ORGANIZE ITSELF AND OPERATE, ADVISING </p><p>ON ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND TRAINING PERSONNEL; </p><p>-- PROVIDE TRAINING IN LABOR MARKET ANALYSIS AND OTHER </p><p>FUNCTIONAL SPECIALTIES; </p><p>-- ASSIST IN WRITING NECESSARY LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS </p><p>TO ENSURE AFGHAN LABOR LAW COMPLIES WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND CORE LABOR STANDARDS; </p><p>-- CREATE SELF-SUSTAINING "TRAIN THE TRAINERS" PROGRAMS FOR </p><p>MINISTRY EMPLOYEES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  WE RECOGNIZE THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DONORS MAY HAVE MORE PRESSING, URGENT NEEDS TO </p><p>MEET BEFORE TURNING TO DEVELOPING A LABOR MINISTRY AND </p><p>ANALYZING LABOR MARKETS -- ESPECIALLY GIVEN FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>GHANI\'S RECENT REMARKS ABOUT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF </p><p>MINISTRIES (REFTEL).  HOWEVER, TO THE EXTENT WE ARE TRYING </p><p>TO PROMOTE IMMEDIATE OR GRADUAL ADHERENCE TO CORE LABOR </p><p>STANDARDS, THE ISCOS PROPOSAL MIGHT OFFER A COMPARATIVELY </p><p>LOW-COST WAY TO INCULCATE A SENSE OF RESPECT FOR THOSE </p><p>STANDARDS, AND STRATEGIES FOR PROMOTING THEIR ADHERENCE, </p><p>WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE AFGHAN MINISTRY.  THE PROJECT MAY </p><p>ALSO FIT IN WITH INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY GOALS OF IMPROVING </p><p>DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND STRENGTHENING THE CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN AFGHANISTAN.  WHILE THE GOI ITSELF HAS ITS </p><p>HANDS FULL WITH MANAGING AFGHAN JUDICIAL REFORM EFFORTS, </p><p>WORKING THROUGH ISCOS ON LABOR MINISTRY  DEVELOPMENT WOULD </p><p>THEORETICALLY NOT DISTRACT FROM THIS FOCUS.  WE HAVE </p><p>REQUESTED ITALIAN FUNDING FOR MANY OTHER DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PROJECTS, HOWEVER, IN AFGHANISTAN AND ELSEWHERE, AND THE GOI </p><p>HAS BEEN STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT ITS RESOURCES ARE STRETCHED. </p><p>IF THE PROJECT IS DEPENDENT ON GOI FUNDING, IT MAY BE A NON- </p><p>STARTER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ACTION REQUEST:  DEPT. PLEASE ADVISE IF YOU WISH US TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE THE ITALIAN MFA TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PROMOTION </p><p>OF CORE LABOR STANDARDS IN AFGHANISTAN, EITHER THROUGH THE </p><p>ISCOS PROPOSAL OR A REVISED VARIANT MORE NARROWLY TARGETED </p><p>AT THIS REQUIREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED - KABUL. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>2003ROME00595 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
