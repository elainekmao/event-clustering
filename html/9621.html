<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001660 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p>USNATO FOR DEHART AND MOELLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EU, HR, NATO, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO) </p><p>SUBJECT: POLITICS, POLITICS: AMBASSADOR\'S INITIAL CALL ON </p><p>PARLIAMENT SPEAKER TOMCIC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The opposition-leading HDZ party will remain strong </p><p>after parliamentary elections this November, but it will not </p><p>be able to form a government; Croatia\'s next coalition </p><p>government will be largely similar to the current lineup of </p><p>parties, Parliament Speaker Zlatko Tomcic confidently </p><p>predicted during his first meeting with the Ambassador. </p><p>Tomcic declared that, right up until the beginning of the </p><p>formal campaign period, the ruling coalition will remain </p><p>focused on driving forward with Croatia\'s top policy </p><p>priorities: integration into the EU and NATO.  The Ambassador </p><p>applauded the coalition\'s consensus on key goals and </p><p>reaffirmed U.S. support for Croatia\'s eventual accession into </p><p>Euro-Atlantic institutions.  There is strong agreement within </p><p>the international community that Croatia must continue to </p><p>make progress on reform; concrete achievements in key areas </p><p>will help Croatia\'s progress toward both NATO and the EU. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Tomcic: Looking Forward to Close Relationship </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On July 22, the Ambassador paid his initial call on </p><p>Parliament (Sabor) Speaker Zlatko Tomcic.  Tomcic was eager </p><p>to establish a close working relationship with the Ambassador </p><p>similar to the one he enjoyed with former Ambassador Rossin. </p><p>Despite the formal elegance of the Sabor\'s reception rooms, </p><p>Tomcic was open and informal about political challenges </p><p>facing the coalition and his Croatian Peasants\' Party (HSS). </p><p>He apologized for not being able to meet with the Ambassador </p><p>in the first days following his arrival in Croatia, </p><p>explaining that official visits by two heads of state (Israel </p><p>and Turkey) and the press of business now before the </p><p>parliament relating to EU accession made scheduling difficult. </p><p> </p><p>Tomcic: We\'re Focused on EU/NATO Accession </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Tomcic declared that both the Government and the </p><p>Parliament\'s majority are in full agreement on Croatia\'s top </p><p>policy priorities: integration into the EU and NATO. </p><p>Parliament passed legislation on defense reform and a law to </p><p>restructure Croatia\'s intelligence services to support the </p><p>Government\'s bid for NATO membership.  The process of </p><p>bringing Croatia\'s legislation into line with EU standards is </p><p>an intense, ongoing process, but the parliament\'s unanimous </p><p>declaration in September 2002 supporting Croatia\'s membership </p><p>application demonstrated Croatia\'s commitment, said Tomcic. </p><p>He complained bitterly about the opposition\'s "destructive, </p><p>selfish" actions in the last two months to boycott voting in </p><p>the Sabor for political reasons.  Tomcic said that he is </p><p>certain that the EU and NATO will judge Croatia\'s suitability </p><p>for membership not only by formal criteria, but also by the </p><p>behavior of the political opposition.  Fortunately, Tomcic </p><p>pointed out, the government enjoys an extraordinary level of </p><p>public support for its accession goals. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Tomcic said that much of the work the parliament is </p><p>doing to help Croatia progress towards the EU and NATO goes </p><p>on behind the scenes, particularly its work to reach out to </p><p>other parliaments in the region.  Croatia knows it cannot </p><p>progress in a vacuum: a stable and prosperous Croatia can </p><p>only exist in a stable and prosperous region.  Tomcic said </p><p>that, since Croatia may be several steps ahead of some states </p><p>in the region, it can serve as an example of how to move </p><p>forward. </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador: Croatia Has Lots Of Work To Do </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador welcomed Tomcic\'s commitment to EU and </p><p>NATO membership and said that the U.S. remains committed to </p><p>helping Croatia achieve these goals.  He hailed the broad </p><p>support for these goals among Croatia\'s political leaders, </p><p>but explained that there is also broad consensus within the </p><p>international community that Croatia has important reform </p><p>work still to achieve.  The international community agrees </p><p>that for EU and NATO accession, Croatia must make concrete </p><p>progress on key issues, including refugee return, judicial </p><p>reform, ICTY cooperation and regional relations.  U.S. </p><p>assistance programs are directed toward helping Croatia </p><p>achieve these goals.  Tomcic expressed appreciation for the </p><p>Ambassador\'s support and also for the significant commitment </p><p>of U.S. assistance to Croatia since the change in government </p><p>in January 2000. </p><p> </p><p>Privatization: HSS Pressing For Changes to Law </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Responding to the Ambassador\'s question about the </p><p>politically sensitive issue of privatization, Tomcic claimed </p><p>that the disparity between his party\'s view and that of PM </p><p>Racan\'s SDP has been exaggerated by Croatia\'s irresponsible </p><p>media.  Under the Tudjman regime, the privatization process </p><p>was an opportunity for "their people" to get rich by taking </p><p>public property.  While the current government has done much </p><p>better, Tomcic expressed regret that it has not made as much </p><p>progress as the public had hoped.  Not a single large-scale </p><p>privatization has taken place without "incident," Tomcic </p><p>complained.  Tomcic said that the SDP and the HSS have now </p><p>agreed on a way forward (according to an HSS model), and that </p><p>a new law on privatization would be presented to parliament </p><p>in September.  Tomcic brought up the recent privatization of </p><p>25 percent of INA, Croatia\'s state-owned energy company, and </p><p>declared that he is convinced that this process was "very </p><p>correct," and that there would be no "dirty laundry" </p><p>discovered, despite what might be alleged in the press. </p><p> </p><p>Sabor to Work Overtime to Keep Election Campaign Short </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The Ambassador steered the conversation toward </p><p>electoral politics, and asked how the parliament\'s work would </p><p>be affected by the campaign.  Tomcic said that an election </p><p>date in late November had been agreed to with key coalition </p><p>partners, but that would not stop him from keeping the </p><p>parliament at work.  He told the Ambassador that he had </p><p>already announced an extraordinary session from September 9 - </p><p>15, which means that the Sabor will be in session </p><p>continuously until the middle of October, focused almost </p><p>entirely on the EU accession agenda.  Tomcic expressed hope </p><p>that the official campaign period will be kept as short as </p><p>possible in order to keep conflicts between parties to a </p><p>minimum and also to keep the costs of campaigning -- which </p><p>are by law covered primarily by the state budget -- as low as </p><p>possible. </p><p> </p><p>Election Prediction: Return of Our Coalition </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Tomcic predicted that the opposition HDZ would be the </p><p>leading vote-getter in the next election, but was confident </p><p>that it would not be able to attract enough support from </p><p>other parties to form a government.  The SDP would fare well, </p><p>but would get "slightly fewer" seats in the next parliament. </p><p>He expected his own HSS to do slightly better than the 16 </p><p>seats (about ten percent of the total) it holds in the </p><p>current Sabor, but the Croatian People\'s Party (HNS) would </p><p>also see a sharp improvement. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Tomcic said that, since the SDP, HSS and HNS will </p><p>probably not have quite enough seats to form an absolute </p><p>majority, the coalition will have to rely on those MPs which </p><p>will fall outside of the two "blocs."  Tomcic said he expects </p><p>that the next Sabor will have as many as 15 MPs from smaller </p><p>or regional parties, fully eight MPs representing ethnic </p><p>minorities and perhaps four who represent Croatians abroad. </p><p>The most complex part of forming the next government will be </p><p>the process of bringing smaller parties into the coalition. </p><p>Nevertheless, Tomcic is confident that there will be "no </p><p>great changes" between the next coalition government and the </p><p>current lineup of parties.  (Note: Uncertainty about which </p><p>parties would form the next government has usually centered </p><p>on the possibility that Tomcic\'s HSS would break with the </p><p>current coalition and go with the HDZ -- a prospect which </p><p>looks increasingly implausible with each passing week. End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Next Government Must Have Stronger Coalition Agreement </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Tomcic said he believes Croatia\'s democracy has </p><p>developed far enough to "allow the luxury" of waiting to form </p><p>coalitions until after elections.  The HSS will then advocate </p><p>hammering out a strong national-level policy program in order </p><p>to create conditions where disagreements over policy no </p><p>longer disrupt the work of the government.  Such a program </p><p>would mean that ICTY cooperation would not be an issue for </p><p>debate, but an obligation of the government.  The same should </p><p>hold true for issues relating to return of refugees and for </p><p>working to improve relations with Serbia and Montenegro. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The Ambassador praised Tomcic\'s leadership in the </p><p>parliament and expressed his eagerness to continue a regular, </p><p>private dialogue.  Tomcic readily accepted and proposed that </p><p>the two meet again, more informally, toward the end of </p><p>August, before the Sabor next convenes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Tomcic was on-message and worked hard to make a good </p><p>impression; he clearly recognizes how important good </p><p>relations with the U.S. are to achieving Croatia\'s goals.  A </p><p>cagey, cautious politician, for Tomcic to predict a </p><p>successful outcome of the next election with such confidence </p><p>so far in advance is significant, even if his forecast </p><p>largely represents the current conventional wisdom. </p><p>FRANK </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
