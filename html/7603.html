<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000696 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR D, SA, SA/INS, S/CT </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  04-23-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, EAID, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  GSL continues to mull over response to LTTE\'s </p><p>withdrawal from talks, but leans toward restraint </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Ops Center-Colombo 04/23/03 telecon </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 688, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified BY Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons:  1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Key Ministers Moragoda and Peiris told </p><p>the Ambassador that the GSL continues to mull over its </p><p>response to the Tigers\' decision to withdraw from the </p><p>peace talks.  The government seems to be leaning toward </p><p>a restrained, but firm approach at this time.  Taking </p><p>another tack, the president has urged an increase in </p><p>anti-LTTE security measures.  Overall, we think it is </p><p>positive that there has been no panic, but rather a </p><p>level-headed feeling that efforts should be made to try </p><p>to get the process back on track.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CONVERSATIONS WITH KEY MINISTERS:  The </p><p>Ambassador held separate conversations today (April 23) </p><p>with Milinda Moragoda and G.L. Peiris, two key ministers </p><p>working on peace process issues.  Moragoda told the </p><p>Ambassador that the government continued to review how </p><p>it should react to the April 21 announcement by the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) that it was </p><p>withdrawing from the peace talks (see Ref B).  Moragoda </p><p>noted that the view of most of the Cabinet was that the </p><p>GSL should be restrained in its response, but firm. </p><p>Current thinking was to have Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe send a letter to the LTTE at some point </p><p>in the next several days.  (Note:  Per Ref B, the PM </p><p>sent a brief letter to the LTTE on April 22, but it was </p><p>only a placeholder.)  This proposed letter would respond </p><p>to the positive points raised in the LTTE\'s </p><p>announcement, Moragoda said.  In the meantime, the </p><p>government -- including key negotiators Moragoda and </p><p>Peiris -- would continue to engage the Tigers on </p><p>"technical" issues in an effort to build back trust. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In a brief colloquy, Moragoda said the GSL </p><p>wanted to proceed with planning for the Tokyo donors </p><p>conference in June, which the LTTE has said it would not </p><p>attend.  Ambassador Wills agreed that this was a </p><p>sensible approach and something the U.S. supported </p><p>fully.  The Ambassador noted, however, that if there was </p><p>no change in the LTTE\'s position on not attending it was </p><p>possible that some donors might wonder whether holding </p><p>the conference was worthwhile.  Moragoda took this </p><p>comment on board, but seemed a bit unsettled by the </p><p>thought. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In his comments to the Ambassador, G.L. Peiris </p><p>took a somewhat softer line than Moragoda, emphasizing </p><p>that the government needed to review its response to the </p><p>LTTE\'s April 21 statement very carefully.  The GSL, for </p><p>example, should consider the LTTE\'s points that steps </p><p>need to be taken re the Jaffna "high security zones," </p><p>the resettlement of the displaced, improving assistance </p><p>delivery, etc.  The Ambassador asked Peiris whether he </p><p>was being just a bit lenient on the LTTE given its hard- </p><p>line behavior.  Peiris admitted that it was difficult </p><p>dealing with the group. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In line with the views of most observers, if a </p><p>tad more optimistic, Peiris also underlined what he saw </p><p>as silver linings in the LTTE statement, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- The peace process has not broken down and the search </p><p>for a political settlement goes on; </p><p> </p><p>-- The ceasefire still holds; </p><p> </p><p>-- The (joint GSL-LTTE) Sub-Committee on Immediate </p><p>Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs in the North and </p><p>the East (SIHRN) is still in operation; and, </p><p>-- The LTTE continues to support and recognize the </p><p>authority of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM). </p><p>6.  (C) KUMARATUNGA\'S TACK:  In contrast to the cool, </p><p>calculated response of the government (thus far), </p><p>President Kumaratunga has seemingly sought to create a </p><p>crisis atmosphere in the aftermath of the LTTE\'s </p><p>announcement.  In a blitz, the president\'s office has </p><p>announced that she was summoning this-or-that meeting </p><p>with the military and police chiefs, and convoking the </p><p>GSL National Security Council to deal with the "any </p><p>eventuality."  The president\'s Peoples\' Alliance (PA) </p><p>party has also taken the lead in calling for an </p><p>"emergency" meeting of Parliament to discuss the </p><p>"crisis." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) In one April 22 announcement, which received </p><p>significant local and wire-service coverage, the </p><p>president\'s office stated that she had "directed" the </p><p>military and the police "to reintroduce immediately the </p><p>security measures that were set up in 1995 to ensure the </p><p>security and safety of the people."  (Note:  These </p><p>security measures have to do with the widespread use of </p><p>checkpoints and road blocks, as well as other efforts to </p><p>prevent LTTE infiltration.  Many of these measures were </p><p>lifted in the early days of the peace process.)  Re this </p><p>announcement, Interior Secretary M.N. Junaid told A/RSO </p><p>that he had sat in on the late April 21 meeting </p><p>Kumaratunga had had with service chiefs and police </p><p>officials.  He said Kumaratunga had spoke interminably </p><p>throughout the four-hour meeting on the need to increase </p><p>security measures.  Those present heard her out, but in </p><p>the end only agreed to continue to monitor and assess </p><p>the situation, i.e., there was no reintroduction of the </p><p>measures put in place in 1995.  In the meantime, based </p><p>on what Mission is hearing, there has been no increase </p><p>in the operational readiness of the Sri Lankan military </p><p>or police. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  In the aftermath of the LTTE\'s </p><p>announcement, we think it is positive that there is no </p><p>sense of crisis in Sri Lanka.  Instead, per Moragoda\'s </p><p>and Peiris\' remarks, there is a seemingly level-headed </p><p>feeling that work needs to be done to try to get the </p><p>process back on track.  The president\'s somewhat </p><p>contrived response to the LTTE\'s withdrawal from the </p><p>talks seems to be an effort to underscore her long- </p><p>standing claim that the group simply cannot be trusted. </p><p>Despite her best efforts, however, most Sri Lankans </p><p>don\'t seem to want to up the tension, but to cool things </p><p>down.  Whether the LTTE wants to cooperate in that </p><p>effort remains unclear.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
