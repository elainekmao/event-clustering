<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000426 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, ECON, VM, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S VISIT TO VINH LONG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: On May 5, 2003, Ambassador Burghardt, DPO, and Conoff </p><p>traveled to Vinh Long province in the Mekong Delta with Catholic </p><p>Relief Services (CRS) Country Representative Chris Gilson.  The </p><p>Ambassador met with representatives of the provincial People\'s </p><p>Committee and Union of Friendship Organizations (UFO) before </p><p>visiting two villages where CRS is building new homes for flood </p><p>victims.  Religious leaders have been allowed to play a small role </p><p>in the project, which is an encouraging signal about the </p><p>government\'s attitude.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. Arriving in Vinh Long, the Ambassador noted that it had not </p><p>changed much since his last visit to the province 30 years ago. </p><p>Although Vinh Long is the second largest exporter of rice in </p><p>Vietnam (with the U.S. and Iraq as major clients), it remains one </p><p>of the poorest provinces in the country and has an annual GDP per </p><p>capita of $330 USD.  The majority of people live in rural areas </p><p>and rely on agriculture as their main source of income.  The </p><p>province illustrates the relatively slow rate of development and </p><p>lack of infrastructure in the delta region, which suffers </p><p>regularly from flooding during the annual rainy season. </p><p> </p><p>3. The Ambassador visited two villages where CRS is building </p><p>elevated houses for flood victims.  The average income falls below </p><p>$175 USD in these villages, which are inhabited by people of Khmer </p><p>origin.  Villagers gave the Ambassador a warm welcome and appeared </p><p>quite happy with their new homes.  Gilson expressed satisfaction </p><p>with the success of the project and said that by the end of 2003, </p><p>CRS will have built over 1,100 houses in Vinh Long.  CRS began </p><p>working in the province after the flooding in 2000 and has used </p><p>this project to build a better relationship with the Vietnamese </p><p>government in the south where its activities are more restricted </p><p>than in the northern region of the country.  CRS hopes it has </p><p>established valuable contacts that will lead to future cooperation </p><p>on more extensive projects. </p><p> </p><p>4. Phan Van Dau, First Vice Chairman of the Vinh Long People\'s </p><p>Committee, emphasized the poverty in the province and expressed </p><p>gratitude for the CRS projects.  He said he wanted to expand </p><p>cooperation with CRS and other American NGOs.  Noting that there </p><p>had been bitter fighting in the area during the war, Dau said the </p><p>province understood it was time to look to the future and develop </p><p>good relations with the U.S.  A businessman who previously worked </p><p>for a State Owned Enterprise in the rice trade, Dau said the </p><p>province was interested in working with the Consulate to attract </p><p>American companies.  The Ambassador encouraged him to reach out to </p><p>overseas Vietnamese as an investment source.  Dau noted that Vinh </p><p>Long is located on the regular tourist track of the Mekong Delta </p><p>but that the number of tourists in the province has decreased 20 </p><p>to 30 percent as a result of the SARS epidemic. </p><p> </p><p>5. During the trip, the Ambassador had an interesting discussion </p><p>with Tran Van Khai, Vice Chairman of the Vinh Long Union of </p><p>Friendship Organizations, about Decree No. 7 issued at the Ninth </p><p>Party Congress on the relationship between the government and </p><p>religious groups and minorities.  Khai was preparing to take part </p><p>in meetings that are being held throughout Vietnam to educate </p><p>cadre about the decree so they can make sure it is implemented in </p><p>their localities.  Khai claimed that this decree was a </p><p>confirmation of the GVN\'s liberalization toward religious groups. </p><p>He emphasized that the Communist party needed to utilize the </p><p>strengths of religious organizations and encourage their </p><p>participation in government.  The CPV needs new membership and </p><p>cannot afford to exclude religious groups, he added. </p><p> </p><p>6. Gilson said he has noticed the government\'s changing attitude </p><p>toward religious groups through his work in Vinh Long.  Each </p><p>village holds popular assemblies to select the families who will </p><p>receive CRS houses.  Religious leaders, including Catholic clergy, </p><p>take part in these meetings and their advice about their parish </p><p>members is often followed.  According to both Gilson and Khai, </p><p>neither the government nor the party has a role in the decision- </p><p>making process.  Gilson also said this is the first time CRS has </p><p>had the church as a partner on a project in Vietnam and that local </p><p>government officials have been comfortable with this relationship </p><p>thus far. </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT: Despite Khai\'s claim, it is still unclear how the GOV </p><p>intends to implement Decree No. 7 on religion and minorities, </p><p>which has both positive and potentially restrictive elements. </p><p>Vinh Long leadership, at least, appears to be taking some steps in </p><p>the right direction by allowing CRS to partner with a Catholic </p><p>church.  Although Vinh Long officials appear eager for additional </p><p>humanitarian assistance from the U.S., some of the other delta </p><p>provincial leaders are reportedly less forthcoming in their </p><p>dealings with both religious groups and NGOs.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
