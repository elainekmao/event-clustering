(C) SUMMARY:  Forcible recruitment of children by </p><p>the Tamil Tigers remains a serious problem, especially </p><p>in eastern Sri Lanka.  The extent of the practice </p><p>remains unclear, however, with contacts divided as to </p><p>whether or not it is a worsening problem.  The UN and </p><p>the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) are pressing the </p><p>Tigers to clean up their act.  Our assessment is that </p><p>this issue is not going away any time soon.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A SERIOUS PROBLEM:  Forcible recruitment of </p><p>children by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>remains a serious problem.  Tamil contacts, including </p><p>some who are pro-LTTE, regularly report to Mission that </p><p>LTTE personnel are forcing children as young as ten into </p><p>political and military training.  In addition, Sri </p><p>Lankan newspapers carry stories almost every day about </p><p>forcible recruitment by the LTTE, as well as reports </p><p>about children who have escaped from the group.  (Note: </p><p>There are also reports of voluntary returns by the LTTE, </p><p>but these are more rare.)  One recent newspaper story </p><p>that was particularly poignant reported that in </p><p>Batticaloa a young girl, apparently backed by her </p><p>family, was threatening to kill herself by lighting </p><p>herself on fire.  She claimed that her brother had been </p><p>abducted by the LTTE and she wanted the group to release </p><p>him.  (Note:  It is not clear what the exact denouement </p><p>of this incident was, but the girl did not kill </p><p>herself.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) With respect to location, most of the reported </p><p>abductions take place in Sri Lanka\'s Eastern Province. </p><p>Some abductions also occur in Jaffna District and along </p><p>the GSL-LTTE "line of control" near Vavuniya, a city in </p><p>north-central Sri Lanka.  Children are also recruited </p><p>with some regularity in the LTTE-controlled Wanni </p><p>region.  There are no reports of abductions of children </p><p>from the large Tamil community in Colombo. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) EXTENT UNCLEAR:  The extent of forcible </p><p>recruitment of children by the LTTE remains unclear. </p><p>Numbers, for example, are very hard to come by and there </p><p>are sharp divisions on whether the problem is </p><p>increasing. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Some contacts, for example, report that the </p><p>problem is essentially out-of-control and growing worse. </p><p>In a January 22 meeting, Ambassador Bernard </p><p>Goonetilleke, the chief of the government\'s Peace </p><p>Secretariat, told us that in the past several months </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>upwards of 2,000 children may have been abducted by the </p><p>LTTE.  From what he had heard, very few of these </p><p>children have, subsequently, been released by the LTTE </p><p>or escaped from the group.  Goonetilleke\'s comments </p><p>track with those of Father Harry Miller (please </p><p>protect), an Amcit Catholic priest based in Batticaloa, </p><p>who believes that "thousands" of children have been </p><p>abducted by the LTTE in the past year.  Goonetilleke, </p><p>Miller, and some local NGOs in the east believe that the </p><p>problem is decidedly on the upswing. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) On the flip side, respected international </p><p>organizations are reporting that the problem is more </p><p>limited in scope.  UNICEF, for example, which has been </p><p>dealing with this issue for some time, states that the </p><p>number of forcible recruits was somewhat over one </p><p>hundred in 2002.  The Norwegian-run SLMM is reporting </p><p>somewhat higher figures at upwards of 300 abducted </p><p>children in 2002.  In addition, UNICEF, the ICRC, and </p><p>the SLMM all report that they believe that the child </p><p>recruitment problem has been on the downswing in the </p><p>past several months.   The SLMM, for example, cites 28 </p><p>reports in December 2002, down from 38 in November, </p><p>which, in turn, was down from 60 in September. </p><p>(Note:  The vast discrepancy between what Goonetilleke </p><p>and Miller are hearing and what UNICEF and the SLMM are </p><p>reporting is difficult to account for.  That said, </p><p>Goonetilleke\'s and Miller\'s estimates seem more </p><p>anecdotal, whereas UNICEF and the SLMM are relying on </p><p>actual "hard" reports.  SLMM contacts have wondered </p><p>whether the reports they are receiving only constitute </p><p>the "tip of the iceberg" of the problem.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) PRESSING THE TIGERS:  The UN and the SLMM are </p><p>stepping up their pressure on the Tigers to clean up </p><p>their act, urging the group to honor its prior </p><p>commitments.  (Note:  On numerous occasions, the LTTE </p><p>has pledged it will stop recruiting children.)  UNICEF </p><p>Executive Director Carol Bellamy, for example, is due to </p><p>visit Sri Lanka from January 30 - February 2.  She is </p><p>tentatively slated to meet with LTTE representatives </p><p>during the visit.  UNICEF reports that the issue of </p><p>forcible recruitment of children will be high on </p><p>Bellamy\'s agenda.  We have also heard that UN SYG Annan </p><p>plans to raise the issue when he visits Sri Lanka in </p><p>late February. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) In the meantime, the SLMM continues to urge </p><p>the LTTE publicly and in private to stop its recruitment </p><p>efforts.  The SLMM reports that its chief, Major General </p><p>(ret\'d) Trond Furuhovde, plans to raise the issue on </p><p>January 22 in meetings with the LTTE.  In addition to </p><p>the UN and SLMM efforts, Ambassador Goonetilleke </p><p>confirmed to us that human rights issues will form a </p><p>major part of the agenda at the next round of peace </p><p>talks scheduled for February 7-10.  The issue will also </p><p>be an important topic in GSL-LTTE peace sub-committee </p><p>meetings. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  Our assessment is that this issue is </p><p>not going away any time soon.  Although they pay lip </p><p>service to their previous commitments, the Tigers are </p><p>evasive as to what they plan to do to stop child </p><p>recruitment.  With the onset of the peace process, </p><p>however, it is getting increasingly difficult for the </p><p>Tigers to hide what they are doing.  Journalists and </p><p>many others are visiting areas in the north and the east </p><p>with some regularity now, and reports of what transpires </p><p>in those areas are seeping out.  (Note:  See, for </p><p>example, a January 6 article in THE NEW YORK TIMES </p><p>spotlighting the child recruitment issue.)  At the same </p><p>time, if the Tiger leadership wanted to end child </p><p>recruitment, it is not clear whether it has control of </p><p>all of its cadre, especially those in the east. </p><p>Overall, even in the best case scenario with the peace </p><p>process continuing, we doubt that there will be a quick </p><p>fix in this area soon.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
