SIEW\'S PEERS AND SUBORDINATES IN ECONOMIC </p><p>CIRCLES ALL SEE HIM AS SOMEONE WHO ROSE THROUGH THE </p><p>RANKS BECAUSE OF HIS INTELLIGENCE, HIS TECHNICAL </p><p>ABILITY, AND HIS HARD WORK.  OVER YEARS OF DEALING WITH </p><p>U.S. NEGOTIATORS ON MANY THORNY BILATERAL TRADE ISSUES, </p><p>HE EARNED A REPUTATION AS A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR </p><p>ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>5.

IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO OUTGOING PREMIER LIEN CHAN, WHOSE FATHER </p><p>WAS A FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER, SIEW COMES FROM MODEST </p><p>ORIGINS: HIS PARENTS WORKED IN THE FIELDS OUTSIDE </p><p>CHIAYI.  PERHAPS TO REINFORCE THIS IMAGE, SIEW\'S STAFF </p><p>ANNOUNCED AS HE WAS TAKING OFFICE THAT THE NEW PREMIER </p><p>WOULD DO WITHOUT THE POLICE ESCORTS THAT HIS </p><p>PREDECESSOR HAD USED, FREQUENTLY TO THE CONSTERNATION </p><p>OF INCENSED DRIVERS WAVED ASIDE BY THE ESCORT.  (SIEW </p><p>REPORTEDLY WAS UPSET THAT HIS STAFF APPEARED TO BE </p><p>TRYING TO MAKE LIEN CHAN LOOK BAD AND TOLD THEM TO PUT </p><p>A LID ON COMMENTS THAT MIGHT PUT A BAD LIGHT ON HIS </p><p>PREDECESSOR -- WHO REMAINS THE VICE PRESIDENT AND </p><p>PRESIDENT LEE\'S HEIR APPARENT WITHIN THE KMT.)  SIEW </p><p>ALSO HAS A REPUTATION FOR PROBITY AND A STRONG GRASP OF </p><p>ECONOMIC ISSUES.  OBSERVERS HERE ATTRIBUTE HIS SUCCESS </p><p>WITHIN BOTH THE BUREAUCRACY AND THE LEGISLATURE TO HIS </p><p>ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE PERSISTENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY </p><p>WITHOUT ALIENATING HIS INTERLOCUTORS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VICE PREMIER:  JOHN CHANG </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.

(C) ALTHOUGH AN ETHNIC MAINLANDER, CHANG IS WELL- </p><p>LIKED BY ETHNIC TAIWANESE (INCLUDING, REPORTEDLY, </p><p>PRESIDENT LEE).

DURING THE 1995 </p><p>LY ELECTION CAMPAIGN, CHANG CAMPAIGNED VIGOROUSLY FOR </p><p>KMT CANDIDATES IN TAIWAN\'S MAINLANDER-DOMINATED </p><p>MILITARY VILLAGES.

THESE ENTHUSIASTIC AND </p><p>WHOLE-HEARTED ATTEMPTS TO PROMOTE "PRAGMATIC" DIPLOMACY </p><p>STOOD IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE MORE ALOOF OPERATING </p><p>STYLE OF HIS PREDECESSOR, FRED CHIEN. </p><p>ORGANIZATIONALLY, CHANG\'S TENURE AS FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>WAS ALSO NOTEWORTHY FOR HIS ATTEMPTS TO BOOST THE </p><p>STATUS OF WOMEN OFFICERS IN TAIWAN\'S FOREIGN SERVICE; </p><p>HE ELIMINATED QUOTAS IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE ENTERING </p><p>CLASSES, THEREBY INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN PER </p><p>CLASS FROM 15 PERCENT TO MORE THAN HALF.
