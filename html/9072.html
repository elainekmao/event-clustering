<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR EB </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ECIN, EFIN, ETRD, EINV, ETTC, PREL, PTER, PINR, QA, XF, Terrorist Finance </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S WAYNE\'S MEETING WITH ABDULLA BIN AL-ATTIYAH, </p><p>GOVERNOR OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF QATAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (SBU)  Summary:  During a bilateral meeting held June 25 </p><p>on the margins of the International Arab Banking Summit in </p><p>Montreal, A/S Anthony Wayne and Abdulla bin al-Attiyah, </p><p>Governor of the Central Bank of Qatar, discussed the regional </p><p>economic situation with a focus on the fight against </p><p>terrorist financing, privatization plans, and trade issues </p><p>including the President\'s initiatives on the Middle East Free </p><p>Trade Agreement (MEFTA) and Middle East Partnership </p><p>Initiative (MEPI).  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Al-Attiyah confirmed that Qatar\'s economy is booming: </p><p> oil and gas revenues are up; prices on the stock exchange </p><p>are up almost 20% this year after increasing nearly 35% last </p><p>year; and real estate prices are strong. </p><p> </p><p>New Steps to Control Financial Flows </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) A/S Wayne congratulated al-Attiyah on the success of </p><p>last fall\'s anti-money laundering conference and mentioned </p><p>participation by Qatari officials in the recent USG training </p><p>sessions. He stressed the importance we continue to place on </p><p>blocking the flow of funds to terrorist organizations, and </p><p>asked the status of Qatar\'s anti-money laundering </p><p>legislation.  Al-Attiyah said that the money laundering law </p><p>is moving: it has been approved by the Council of Ministers </p><p>and the shura, and should be finalized soon.  The GOQ has </p><p>established a new committee to address money laundering under </p><p>the jurisdiction of the Central bank. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Qatar is adding terrorist financing to the criminal </p><p>law, and has just established a committee to coordinate the </p><p>fight against terrorist financing.  They are adding a legal </p><p>article permitting the Central Bank Governor to freeze any </p><p>asset on instructions from the Attorney General-equivalent. </p><p>(Al-Attiyah said he is pleased that he does not have the </p><p>authority to freeze assets unilaterally, fearing that could </p><p>lead to perceptions of abuse of power.  The proposed </p><p>arrangement will allow officials with access to intelligence </p><p>reporting and legal information to make the decision.) </p><p> </p><p>MEFTA and MEPI have Promise </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Asked his views on MEFTA and MEPI, al-Attiyah said </p><p>he is not an expert.  It sounds like a nice approach; has </p><p>validity; a good idea.  But he wanted to emphasize his </p><p>personal view on the importance of solving Middle East </p><p>problems first.   The initiatives are nice, but the </p><p>Palestinian problem is crucial. Bush seems to be a firm </p><p>president and al-Attiyah stated that he tells people the U.S. </p><p>president shouldn\'t be underestimated.  A/S Wayne responded </p><p>that the situations in Iraq and the Middle East peace process </p><p>are crucial and President Bush and the Administration are </p><p>committed to finding a solution, but MEFTA and MEPI provide </p><p>other pillars to support growth and development in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p>Democracy is Key </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Asked his view on the most important ingredient for </p><p>peace and growth in the region, al-Attiyah said "democracy." </p><p>The region has never had cooperation; it has not even been </p><p>able to agree on a customs union.   The GCC is hoping to </p><p>establish a common currency by 2010, to really integrate the </p><p>GCC economies.  Most big projects in the region are </p><p>successful if they have government support, and the US should </p><p>be sure governments are involved. </p><p> </p><p>Need to Refine Informal Fund Transfer Systems </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> 7. (U) Al-Attiyah noted that during international meetings, </p><p>his fellow GCC Governors have commented on Americans\' </p><p>apparent misunderstanding of the term "hawala," giving it </p><p>meaning beyond its Arabic meaning of "transfer."  A/S  Wayne </p><p>said we are aware of the nuances and have adopted various </p><p>terms such as "informal value transfer system" to refer to </p><p>the process.  There was discussion of the benefits of sharing </p><p>best practices, including licensing those engaged in </p><p>transferring funds and lowering the costs of transferring </p><p>funds in the formal financial system.  Al-Attiyah confirmed </p><p>that in Qatar the correspondent in a hawala transfer should </p><p>be a licensed bank.  He suggested that a more targeted </p><p>approach on specific individuals might be more effective than </p><p>the very broad effort to control all fund transfers.  (The </p><p>issue of providing what could be an expensive system for </p><p>transfer of remittances had been raised during the panel </p><p>discussion moderated by al-Attiyah.) </p><p> </p><p>Privatization Plans </p><p>------------------- </p><p>8. (U) Asked about Qatar\'s privatization plans, al-Attiyah </p><p>mentioned that the first target will be in the petrochemical </p><p>sector, and discussed plans regarding aluminum. </p><p> </p><p>Bio </p><p>--- </p><p>9. (U) Al-Attiyah\'s father has a house in Beirut at which </p><p>al-Attiyah vacations.  He went to school in Michigan and </p><p>attended SAIS.  He later served in Qatar\'s embassy in </p><p>Washington from 1979-82.  He speaks fluent but un-enunciated </p><p>English. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  A/S Wayne cleared this cable. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
