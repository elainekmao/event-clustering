<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 NASSAU 000766 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PREF, HA, BF, Haiti </p><p>SUBJECT: BAHAMAS UNLIKELY TO PRESSURE ARISTIDE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert M. Witajewski, Reasons 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) After returning from the OAS/CARICOM meeting on Haiti </p><p>in Miami, Foreign Minister Fred Mitchell dismissed the </p><p>possibility of invoking the democracy provision of the OAS </p><p>Charter in the case of Haiti.  He acknowledged problems with </p><p>democracy in Haiti, but made it clear that the Bahamian </p><p>government preferred continued engagement with President </p><p>Aristide to any type of public confrontation.  He also </p><p>announced a decision to provide $500,000 in economic </p><p>assistance to Haiti, while admitting that it would not do </p><p>much good if the political situation did not improve. </p><p>Mitchell\'s main concern is doing whatever he can to slow down </p><p>illegal immigration from Haiti - a key domestic political </p><p>imperative - and he has been fruitlessly pursuing an </p><p>immigration accord with the Government of Haiti for several </p><p>months.  A high official at the Foreign Ministry, although he </p><p>proclaimed himself "not competent" to comment on Haiti policy </p><p>(or much of anything else), confirmed that Haiti believes it </p><p>must stay engaged with the Aristide government to prevent a </p><p>mass migration.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Democracy in Crisis... </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Upon his return from Miami, Foreign Minister Mitchell </p><p>discussed the situation there with the press.  He admitted </p><p>that the CARICOM Foreign Ministers were "frustrated with the </p><p>situation in Haiti, and said that Aristide had put the </p><p>international community "in a difficult position" by not </p><p>living up to his commitments.  He spoke frankly about Haiti\'s </p><p>failure to: select an appropriate police commissioner, arrest </p><p>an important fugitive involved in political violence, and </p><p>plan for elections.  While he placed some of the blame for </p><p>the lack of progress toward a political solution on the </p><p>opposition, he acknowledged the government\'s greater share of </p><p>blame and discussed the reasons why the opposition might feel </p><p>threatened and unwilling to make concessions. </p><p> </p><p>... But Need to Give Aristide Another Chance </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) However, Mitchell went on to say that he thought it </p><p>was "likely that the deadline will be extended," and Aristide </p><p>should be given yet another chance to meet his commitments. </p><p>He pointed out that The Bahamas, in his opinion has no </p><p>choice: "We cannot afford to disengage from Haiti because </p><p>disengaging for us is not an option."  According to Mitchell, </p><p>the issue of Haitian migrants and the potential for mass </p><p>migration is the key issue for The Bahamas.  Such a mass </p><p>migration must be prevented at all costs, and Mitchell made </p><p>it clear that he believed the best way to do that was </p><p>continued engagement with the Aristide government in an </p><p>attempt to improve Haiti\'s political and economic situation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Mitchell was dismissive of the possibility of </p><p>invoking the democracy provisions of the OAS Charter, saying </p><p>that although "Some people argue that\'s the case in Haiti ... </p><p>I think that is taking it a little bit too far."  He </p><p>described the U.S. position on Haiti as "hard-minded", and </p><p>called for continued dialogue.  Mitchell also announced a </p><p>$500,000 economic assistance package for Haiti.  In </p><p>announcing it, he acknowledged that the assistance would </p><p>likely not do much good unless the political impasse were </p><p>resolved.  Mitchell defended the package, however, by </p><p>reiterating that the Government of the Bahamas must do </p><p>whatever it can to improve the economic situation in Haiti </p><p>because of the impact The Bahamas would likely feel if </p><p>further economic and political crisis resulted in a mass </p><p>migration.  He made it very clear that this is the paramount </p><p>issue for The Bahamas. </p><p> </p><p>Who Is Competent Then? </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) DCM and POL/ECON section chief raised the issue of </p><p>Haiti with Ministry of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for </p><p>Political Affairs Marco Rolle in an April 15 meeting </p><p>requested by Rolle to go over the list of pending items </p><p>between the Embassy and the MFA.  Rolle, despite being the </p><p>number three official at the Ministry of Embassy (he is the </p><p>Bahamian equivalent of Undersecretary Grossman) and having </p><p>accompanied Mitchell to both Miami and the press conference, </p><p>told us that he "was not competent" to talk about Haiti </p><p>policy with us.  He couldn\'t even confirm any details about </p><p>the aid package the Minister had announced in his presence. </p><p>Nor could he comment on progress made toward an immigration </p><p>accord with Haiti or the upcoming visit by Mitchell to Haiti </p><p>in late March beyond confirming the dates (May 22-23).  The </p><p>one specific response we received to a question was whether </p><p>or not Foreign Minister Fred Mitchell planned to make any </p><p>trips or telephone calls to Haitian counterparts prior to the </p><p>April 30 OAS meeting in Washington.  The answer is: No. </p><p> </p><p>Consistently Not Competent </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Inability to provide specific responses to queries </p><p>was a consistent theme of our conversation with Rolle.  Of </p><p>the fifteen pending items on our agenda, he was unable to </p><p>comment meaningfully on any single one of them, and could not </p><p>point to MFA progress in resolving any of the issues which </p><p>have been pending anywhere from 2-3 weeks (dip notes </p><p>regarding a trade dispute, RBDF training and a proposal to </p><p>form an anti-alien-smuggling task force) to 6 years (request </p><p>for a bilateral work agreement).  Rolle, a career civil </p><p>servant with no background in foreign affairs, has only been </p><p>with the ministry for about seven months, so it can be </p><p>understood that he might not be familiar with every issue, </p><p>but we would think he could do better than 0 for 15.  The </p><p>Bahamian civil service has honed sloth and delay disguised as </p><p>deliberation and consensus-building to a fine art. </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7.   (C) We believe the bottom line for The Bahamas on Haiti </p><p>is their fear of mass migration and doing anything that might </p><p>trigger an outflow.  Mitchell in particular has made </p><p>conclusion of an immigration agreement his top foreign policy </p><p>priority.  Our sources in the Immigration Department tell us </p><p>the negotiations are not going well, stalled over Haitian </p><p>insistence on an amnesty for the 30,000 - 100,000 Haitians </p><p>already in The Bahamas (most illegally).  Such a concession </p><p>would be suicide for Mitchell in the xenophobic Bahamian </p><p>political landscape.  Pursuit of this agreement and any other </p><p>means to slow down migration will continue to push any </p><p>concerns for democracy and human rights into the backseat. </p><p>While The Bahamas will remain engaged on Haiti, the Christie </p><p>government will resist any effort to put real teeth into any </p><p>diplomatic effort to pressure President Aristide, preferring </p><p>(endless) conversation and dialogue to the alternative. </p><p> </p><p>BLANKENSHIP </p><p></p></div>
