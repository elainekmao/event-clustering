<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 007766 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, TU, POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>SUBJECT: AK PARTY IN A PARLIAMENTARY LANDSLIDE: CLOSE TO A </p><p>TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 7726 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 7713 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 7697 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 7683 </p><p>     E. ANKARA 7682 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Justice and Development (AK) Party\'s landslide </p><p>victory and Establishment standard-bearer Republican People\'s </p><p>Party\'s (CHP) distant second-place finish in Turkey\'s Nov. 3 </p><p>general elections cuts the number of parties in parliament </p><p>back to only two for the first time in decades.  While P.M. </p><p>Ecevit and Kemalist pundits professed shock at the results, a </p><p>varied spectrum of other commentators and leading businessmen </p><p>made balanced and forward-looking assessments.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. AK Party has won big (reftels).  With more than 94% of </p><p>votes tabulated, AK\'s 34.1% of the vote will give it more </p><p>than 360 of the 550 seats, CHP\'s 19.2% will give it about 176 </p><p>seats, and there will be nine independent M.P.\'s under the </p><p>complex proportional system currently in effect.  At 0200 </p><p>local on Nov. 4 AK vice chairman Mercan told us that </p><p>according to AK\'s calculations, the party is only two seats </p><p>shy of the 367 seat (two-thirds) majority it would need to be </p><p>able to meet one of AK leader Erdogan\'s campaign pledges -- </p><p>to amend and democratize the 1982 constitution, drafted under </p><p>the direction of the Turkish military.  Mercan opined that AK </p><p>might reach 367 as results are clarified; unofficial final </p><p>seat distribution will be clearer later the morning of Nov. 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. All three parties in the current coalition government -- </p><p>whose cabinet will remain in caretaker status until AK forms </p><p>a government -- failed to cross the 10% threshold.  P.M. </p><p>Ecevit\'s DSP was obliterated with 1.3% of the vote; in 1999 </p><p>it got 22%.  ANAP fell to 5.2% from 13% in 1999.  MHP only </p><p>managed to reach 8.5%, less than half the 18% it got in 1999, </p><p>which led party chairman Bahceli to the step -- unusual in </p><p>Turkish politics -- of accepting responsibility for the </p><p>failure and announcing he will not run again for the party </p><p>leadership in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Tansu Ciller\'s DYP, the principal opposition party in the </p><p>just-ended session of parliament, made a close run at the </p><p>threshold but appears to have fallen just a half percentage </p><p>point short.  Islamist Saadet Party, which had also been in </p><p>vocal opposition in the last parliament, garnered only 2.6%. </p><p>Pro-Kurdish DEHAP failed to reach the threshold but in </p><p>winning 6.3% improved significantly over its predecessor </p><p>HADEP\'s 1999 showing.  Motorola deadbeat Cem Uzan\'s upstart </p><p>Genc Party, which many had worried would make it into </p><p>parliament, tallied only 7.3%. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The numbers show that (1) 45% of the votes cast will not </p><p>be represented in the new parliament because they went to </p><p>parties unable to cross the threshold; (2) upwards of 60% of </p><p>the vote went to non-Establishment parties; (3) the </p><p>traditional center-right parties, which have dominated </p><p>Turkish politics for generations, got only 15% of the vote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. P.M. Ecevit and like-minded opinion-makers, who had raised </p><p>the spectre of a "regime crisis" if AK were to win, expressed </p><p>dismay at the size of AK\'s victory.  However, a varied </p><p>spectrum of commentators, from Nazli Ilicak (formerly both </p><p>doyenne of the center-right press and an M.P. with the </p><p>now-closed Islamist Fazilet Party) to reform-minded captains </p><p>of industry Sakip Sabanci and Cem Boyner, publicly </p><p>underscored (1) the legitimacy of the results; and (2) AK\'s </p><p>standing as a party of the center.  Nazli Ilicak also </p><p>interpreted the result as reflecting Turkish voters\' </p><p>aspirations for the kind of equilibrium that a one-party </p><p>government in a two-party parliament can provide. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
