<p>S E C R E T RANGOON 000860 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, BM, ASSK, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: MP\'S-ELECT SHARE THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) Summary:  MPs-elect told us July 18 that they expect </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi to be released fairly soon, that the party </p><p>remains strong and its members dedicated and loyal, and that </p><p>they hope to avoid any "sporadic" anti-regime action that </p><p>could serve as a pretext for an even tougher crackdown on the </p><p>pro-democracy movement.  If and when the NLD acts, the MPs </p><p>continued, it would be on a coordinated, nation-wide basis. </p><p>The British Embassy here has heard talk of NLD plans to </p><p>declare a parallel government.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Emboffs, accompanied by a British diplomat, met in </p><p>Rangoon July 18 with five Members of Parliament Elect (i.e., </p><p>elected in the junta-annulled 1990 election).  Four are </p><p>provincial-level NLD leaders and one is a member of the Party </p><p>for National Democracy (the party of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s first </p><p>cousin and prime minister of the NCGUB, Dr. Sein Win).  Two </p><p>of the five were recently released from detention after being </p><p>arrested in the post-May 30th crackdown on the NLD.  A brief </p><p>recap of significant points follows: </p><p> </p><p>-- They do not expect ASSK will be imprisoned for a long </p><p>period, as international and domestic pressure is building on </p><p>the regime to release her. </p><p> </p><p>-- The local party members remain dedicated and "are willing </p><p>to gather and strike if we ask them." </p><p> </p><p>-- The party has yet to take any concerted action, as the </p><p>members await direction from its leaders.  "We have pledged </p><p>ourselves to Aung San Suu Kyi and U Aung Shwe and would not </p><p>want to do anything against their wishes." </p><p> </p><p>-- If, however, ASSK and U Aung Shwe are not soon released, </p><p>the provincial-level leadership will meet to coordinate </p><p>national policy. </p><p> </p><p>-- They say any anti-regime action must be national and </p><p>coordinated.  They fear that sporadic violence, particularly </p><p>in Rangoon or Mandalay, could spark an even harsher military </p><p>crackdown on democracy supporters. </p><p> </p><p>-- The SPDC claims ASSK provoked the "clash" of May 30th and </p><p>planned some violence in Rangoon in an attempt to spur a </p><p>general uprising, they explained.  The MPs-elect are </p><p>concerned that some student hotheads may play into the SPDC\'s </p><p>hands by undertaking scattered violent acts. </p><p> </p><p>-- Overall, the MPs said they welcomed the events since May </p><p>30th, as they might prove to be a catalyst for positive </p><p>change.  One of those recently released said somewhat </p><p>ruefully, "Experience can be a wonderful teacher, but lately </p><p>the school fees have been very high." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The British diplomat afterwards told us she had heard </p><p>from other MPs-elect that some MPs-elect are considering </p><p>announcing a parallel government.  (We have heard the same, </p><p>but only third-hand.)  She added that in her recent </p><p>discussions with Thailand-based anti-regime youths, it is </p><p>apparent that some leaders are pressing for direct action and </p><p>now reject any hope of resumed "dialogue."  These young </p><p>people have taken heart "from the language of the bill your </p><p>Congress just passed," she said. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: We note that the Burmese Freedom and </p><p>Democracy Act includes the sentence, "The policy of the </p><p>United States, as articulated by the President on April 24, </p><p>2003, is to officially recognize the NLD as the legitimate </p><p>representative of the Burmese people as determined by the </p><p>1990 election."  We will seek to provide measured advice to </p><p>any MPs-elect who might be considering declaring a parallel </p><p>government on the basis of this or other statements.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
