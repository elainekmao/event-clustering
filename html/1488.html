HRINAK, AMBASSADOR.  REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE RIVALRY BETWEEN VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA HAS BEEN </p><p>LONGSTANDING, WITH ROOTS REACHING BACK AS FAR AS THE BREAK- </p><p>UP OF GRAN COLOMBIA INTO SEPARATE STATES.  OVER THE YEARS, </p><p>THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES - AND ESPECIALLY </p><p>BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE MILITARIES - MANIFESTED ITSELF AS </p><p>A PERSISTENT TENSION.  OVER TIME, HOWEVER, THESE TENSIONS </p><p>HAD BECOME INSTITUTIONALIZED AND MANAGED WITH GREAT EFFORT </p><p>AND ENERGY THROUGHOUT SUCCEEDING VENEZUELAN AND COLOMBIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENTS.  FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS, HOWEVER, THESE </p><p>EFFORTS, AT LEAST ON THE VENEZUELAN SIDE OF THE BORDER, </p><p>HAVE TAKEN A BACK SEAT TO THE SIGNIFICANT AMBITIONS OF </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S CURRENT LEADER, PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ.  RECENT </p><p>TENSIONS IN THE RELATIONSHIP ARE NOT JUST THE RESULT OF </p><p>MISCALCULATION OR INEXPERIENCE.  THEY ARE ALSO A DIRECT </p><p>EXPRESSION OF DEEPLY-HELD CONVICTIONS BY CHAVEZ RELATING TO </p><p>HIS ROLE IN THE WORLD, THE DESIRABILITY OF SPREADING HIS </p><p>"BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION" TO NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, AND HIS </p><p>VIEW OF THE FARC AND ELN AS PHILOSOPHICAL KINSMEN IN THE </p><p>LATTER ENDEAVOR.  WE SEE ZERO LIKELIHOOD OF THESE VIEWS -- </p><p>AND RESULTING GOV BEHAVIOR -- CHANGING IN THE FUTURE, AND </p><p>ANTICIPATE FUTURE TENSIONS BETWEEN VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>A VERY BUMPY ROAD SO FAR </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE FIRST SERIOUS DIPLOMATIC INCIDENT BETWEEN </p><p>VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA OCCURRED JUST ONE MONTH INTO </p><p>PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ\'S PRESIDENCY, ON MACH 10, 1999, </p><p>DURING ONE OF CHAVEZ\'S FIRST PRESS CONFERENCES, WHEN HE </p><p>MADE A STATEMENT WHICH APPEARED TO CONFER BELLIGERENT </p><p>STATUS ON THE FARC, MUCH TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>PUBLICLY EXPRESSED CONCERN AND CONSTERNATION.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER JOSE VICENTE RANGEL TRIED TO DOWNPLAY THE </p><p>INCIDENT, THE EVENT PROVED TO BE ONLY THE FIRST EPISODE OF </p><p>WHAT HAS BECOME AN OFT-REPEATED PATTERN IN VENEZUELAN- </p><p>COLOMBIAN RELATIONS: CHAVEZ OR RANGEL MAKES A REMARK WHICH </p><p>INSPIRES A SHARP PUBLIC REJECTION BY COLOMBIA.  THE </p><p>VENEZUELANS EXPRESS SURPRISE AT THE COLOMBIAN REACTION, </p><p>INSISTING THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.  THE COLOMBIANS LET </p><p>THE MATTER DROP, AND RELATIONS APPEAR TO RETURN TO THE </p><p>STATUS QUO ANTE, UNTIL A SIMILAR STATEMENT BY CHAVEZ OR </p><p>RANGEL STARTS THE CYCLE AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) WE SAY "APPEAR" TO RETURN TO THE STATUS QUO ANTE </p><p>BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE INCIDENTS HAVE A CUMULATIVE </p><p>NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE RELATIONSHIP.  (NOTE: WE WOULD </p><p>WELCOME EMBASSY BOGOTA\'S COMMENTS ON THIS.)  FURTHERMORE, </p><p>THE CHAVEZ/RANGEL BEHAVIOR THAT LEADS TO THESE DUST-UPS </p><p>WITH VENEZUELA\'S NEIGHBOR SHOWS NO SIGNS OF TAPERING OFF. </p><p>INDEED, THE MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT -- WHICH LED COLOMBIA TO </p><p>RECALL ITS AMBASSADOR FOR CONSULTATIONS -- TOOK PLACE ONLY </p><p>LAST NOVEMBER.  (NOTE: THE INCIDENT INVOLVED APPEARANCE BY </p><p>SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE FARC AT A SEMINAR ON PLAN COLOMBIA </p><p>HELD IN THE NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE PALACE.  THE SEMINAR WAS </p><p>SPONSORED BY THE VENEZUELAN REPRESENTATIVES TO THE LATIN </p><p>AMERICAN PARLIAMENT, BUT IN FACT, WE HAVE INFORMATION TO </p><p>THE EFFECT THAT THE GOV WAS FULLY INVOLVED IN FACILITATING </p><p>THE TRAVEL OF THE FARC MEMBERS.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>CHAVEZ\'S LONGED-FOR ROLE IN THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MANY OF THE STATEMENTS FROM CHAVEZ OR RANGEL THAT </p><p>HAVE CAUSED A NEGATIVE PUBLIC REACTION BY COLOMBIA INVOLVE </p><p>UNASKED-FOR SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE PEACE PROCESS.  THESE </p><p>STATEMENTS IN OUR VIEW REFLECT TWO STRONGLY-HELD </p><p>CONVICTIONS BY CHAVEZ: 1) THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS </p><p>SHOULD BE INTERNATIONALIZED; 2) THAT HE SHOULD PLAY A MAJOR </p><p>ROLE IN ANY SUCH ESQUIPULAS-TYPE PROCESS.  THE TWO IDEAS, </p><p>OF COURSE, ARE CLOSELY INTERRELATED.  CHAVEZ APPEARS </p><p>SINCERELY CONVINCED THAT PASTRANA CAN\'T DO THE JOB ALONE, </p><p>AND THAT INTERNATIONAL MEDIATION BETWEEN THE GOC AND THE </p><p>REBELS IS NECESSARY.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE IDEA OF A </p><p>STARRING ROLE FOR CHAVEZ CLEARLY CONNECTS WITH HIS MANIFEST </p><p>CONCEPTION OF HIMSELF AS A MAJOR THIRD WORLD LEADER, IN THE </p><p>FOREFRONT OF EFFORTS TO CREATE A "MULTIPOLAR" (V. U.S.- </p><p>DOMINATED "UNIPOLAR") WORLD.  IT IS NATURAL THAT HE WOULD </p><p>SEE NEIGHBORING COLOMBIA, WITH ITS HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION </p><p>WITH SIMON BOLIVAR, AS A NATURAL PLACE FOR SUCH ACTIVISM ON </p><p>HIS PART. IT IS ALSO PERFECTLY RATIONAL FOR A VENEZUELAN </p><p>PRESIDENT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA. </p><p>BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE EGO-CENTERED ELEMENTS WE HAVE </p><p>DESCRIBED ABOVE CAN BE IGNORED IN ANALYZING CHAVEZ\'S </p><p>POLICIES TOWARDS COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>WHOSE SIDE IS HE ON? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THAT\'S NOT AN EASY QUESTION TO ANSWER.  THE OFFICIAL </p><p>GOV LINE, BOTH PUBLICLY AND IN PRIVATE TO US, IS THAT </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S CONTACTS WITH THE COLOMBIAN REBELS ARE CENTERED </p><p>ON PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF VENEZUELANS WHO SUFFER FROM </p><p>REBEL ACTIVITIES ON VENEZUELA\'S SIDE OF THE COMPLETELY </p><p>POROUS BORDER: NEGOTIATING THE RELEASE OF KIDNAPPED </p><p>VENEZUELANS, ETC.  CHAVEZ AND RANGEL HAVE RECENTLY ADMITTED </p><p>THAT RETIRED VENEZUELAN NAVY CAPTAIN RAMON RODRIGUEZ CHACIN </p><p>(LONG CLOSE TO CHAVEZ, WE BELIEVE) FROM TIME TO TIME </p><p>CARRIES OUT SPECIAL MISSIONS FOR THE GOV IN COLOMBIA </p><p>ITSELF.  HOWEVER, CHAVEZ AND RANGEL ASSERT THAT THESE </p><p>MISSIONS ARE PURELY RELATED TO RELEASE OF KIDNAP VICTIMS </p><p>(RODRIGUEZ CHACIN HAS IN FACT NEGOTIATED THE FREEING OF </p><p>PERSONS HELD BY BOTH THE FARC AND THE ELN, INCLUDING A U.S. </p><p>CITIZEN HELD BY THE LATTER) AND THAT THE MISSIONS TAKE </p><p>PLACE WITH THE CONSENT OF THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT, AND </p><p>SOMETIMES EVEN AT ITS REQUEST.  ACTIONS SUCH AS PERMITTING </p><p>REBELS TO MEET WITH VARIOUS OTHER COLOMBIAN POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS, OR ERSTWHILE LEADERS, IN THE PEACE-PROCESS ARE </p><p>JUSTIFIED AS DISINTERESTED GOOD OFFICES PROVIDED WITH GOC </p><p>KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT AND AIMED AT PERMITTING COLOMBIANS </p><p>THEMSELVES TO WORK OUT A PEACEFUL, NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO </p><p>THE INSURGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN FACT, AS WE HAVE REPORTED IN VARIOUS OTHER </p><p>CHANNELS, WE BELIEVE THAT AT LEAST THE SYMPATHIES OF THE </p><p>GOV FOR THE REBELS ARE FAR GREATER THAN THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED </p><p>OFFICIAL LINE SUGGESTS.  FROM HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS ALONE, </p><p>IT IS CLEAR THAT CHAVEZ REGARDS THE FARC AND ELN AS </p><p>LEGITIMATE BELLIGERENTS, AND THAT ANY PEACE SETTLEMENT </p><p>SHOULD NOT JUST INVOLVE THEM TURNING IN THEIR ARMS AND </p><p>TRANSFORMING THEMSELVES MEEKLY INTO POLITICAL PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) WHY WOULD CHAVEZ HOLD SUCH VIEWS?  THE FIRST POINT </p><p>TO BEAR IN MIND IS THAT HOWEVER ELUSIVE THE CONCEPT OF HIS </p><p>"BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION" MAY BE FOR OTHERS, IT IS ABSOLUTELY </p><p>CENTRAL TO HIS THINKING AND ACTIONS.  ONE COMPONENT OF IT </p><p>IS A CHAMPIONING OF THE INTERESTS OF THE LOWER CLASSES </p><p>AGAINST ENTRENCHED ELITES.  IF ONE SEES ON ONE SIDE LEFT- </p><p>WING GUERRILLA-FIGHTERS (WHOSE VERY IDENTITY AS SUCH IS </p><p>LIKELY TO APPEAL TO CHAVEZ\'S ROMANTIC SIDE), AND ON THE </p><p>OTHER A COLOMBIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH -- AT LEAST TO </p><p>OBSERVERS IN CARACAS -- LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE ONE CHAVEZ </p><p>DESTROYED IN VENEZUELA," IT IS NOT HARD TO SEE WHICH SIDE </p><p>HIS HEART LEANS TOWARD. WHETHER OR NOT HE SHARES ALL THE </p><p>OBJECTIVES OF THE REBELS, IT SEEMS THAT HE REGARDS THEM AS </p><p>AT LEAST PROTO-BOLIVARIANS, AND ALLIES IN THE GOAL WE </p><p>BELIEVE HE HOLDS OF SEEING A VERSION OF HIS PROGRAM IN </p><p>VENEZUELA SPREAD TO THE OTHER ANDEAN COUNTRIES, AND PERHAPS </p><p>BEYOND.  WHILE CHAVEZ ISSUES FREQUENT PUBLIC EXPRESSIONS OF </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE SCOURGE OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING, HE </p><p>CONVENIENTLY IGNORES THE FARC\'S SUBSTANTIAL CONNECTION TO </p><p>THE DRUG TRADE.  FINALLY, IT IS NOT HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT </p><p>MIGHT BE THE ADVICE OF HIS CLOSE FRIEND FIDEL CASTRO </p><p>REGARDING THE MOST DESIRABLE OUTCOME IN COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>CHAVEZ AND PLAN COLOMBIA </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) CHAVEZ AND HIS FOREIGN MINISTER HAVE MADE CLEAR </p><p>THEIR STRONG OBJECTION TO THE MILITARY COMPONENT OF PLAN </p><p>COLOMBIA, WHICH CHAVEZ RECENTLY REITERATED BY PUBLICLY </p><p>STATING THAT HIS POSITION "WOULD NOT CHANGE."  THEY SAY IT </p><p>WILL SIMPLY INCREASE THE VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA, CAUSE AN </p><p>INFLUX OF REFUGEES IN VENEZUELA, AND LEAD TO A POSSIBLE </p><p>TRANSFER TO THIS COUNTRY OF NARCOTRAFFICKING OPERATIONS </p><p>CURRENTLY LOCATED IN COLOMBIA, COMPLEMENTING UNDERLYING </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE COLOMBIAN THREAT TO VENEZUELA.  IT </p><p>SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THESE CONCERNS ARE SHARED ACROSS A </p><p>VERY BROAD SPECTRUM OF VENEZUELAN SOCIETY, INCLUDING AMONG </p><p>PERSONS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO OTHER CHAVEZ POLICIES RELATING </p><p>TO COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THINGS WON\'T GET BETTER </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) IF OUR ABOVE ANALYSIS IS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT, THEN </p><p>IT IS PURE WISHFUL THINKING TO IMAGINE THAT CHAVEZ IS </p><p>MERELY ON SOME KIND OF AN UPWARD-TRENDING, ALBEIT SHALLOW, </p><p>LEARNING CURVE AS FAR AS HIS POLICIES TOWARDS COLOMBIA IS </p><p>CONCERNED.  RATHER THAN BEING JUST INADVERTENT MISSTEPS </p><p>BORN OUT OF INEXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THOSE POLICIES STEM </p><p>FROM THE DEEPLY HELD CONVICTIONS AND OBJECTIVES WE HAVE </p><p>SOUGHT TO OUTLINE ABOVE.  THEREFORE, DESPITE CHAVEZ\'S </p><p>CONSTANT PROTESTATIONS OF HIS DESIRE FOR GOOD RELATIONS </p><p>WITH PASTRANA, WE BELIEVE THE CURRENT PATTERN OF GOV </p><p>BEHAVIOR IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE, AND INDEED ITS NEGATIVE </p><p>ELEMENTS COULD EVEN BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED UNDER CERTAIN </p><p>SCENARIOS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) VENEZUELAN-COLOMBIAN RELATIONS HAVE LONG BEEN </p><p>MARKED BY THE KIND OF SUSPICION WHICH SEEMS RELATIVELY </p><p>COMMON AMONG NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES IN THE HEMISPHERE.  BUT </p><p>THAT SUSPICION HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN MODERATED BY A </p><p>REALIZATION OF THE NEED FOR A MODUS VIVENDI.  THIS IN TURN </p><p>LED TO THE CREATION OVER THE YEARS OF AN IMPRESSIVE NUMBER </p><p>OF POLITICAL BUFFER MECHANISMS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, </p><p>INCLUDING A BI-NATIONAL COMMISSION INVOLVING THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF NUMEROUS MINISTRIES, STUDY GROUPS, AND IN </p><p>THE AREA OF COUNTER-NARCOTICS, INTELLIGENCE-SHARING </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS AND EXTRACTION AND INSERTION ASSISTANCE, AND </p><p>CROSS-BORDER PURSUIT COOPERATION.  AT LEAST PARTIALLY AS A </p><p>RESULT OF RECENT DISTURBING BORDER INCIDENTS BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO COUNTRIES\' MILITARIES, THE VENEZUELAN-COLOMBIAN BORDER </p><p>AFFAIRS COMMISSION -- WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE SINCE THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE CHAVEZ ADMINISTRATION -- IS SCHEDULED TO </p><p>MEET ON FEBRUARY 22.  (NOTE:  VENEZUELA SUSPENDED A </p><p>COMMISSION MEETING SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 2000.) </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) CAN WE DO ANYTHING?  OUR REPEATED URGINGS, MADE TO </p><p>CHAVEZ NOT MERELY BY THIS EMBASSY BUT BY HIGH LEVEL </p><p>VISITORS, TO THE EFFECT OF FOLLOWING A "NO SURPRISES" (FOR </p><p>PASTRANA) POLICY TOWARDS COLOMBIA HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BORNE </p><p>NO FRUIT TO DATE.  NOR SHOULD THAT SURPRISE US, FOR </p><p>CHAVEZ\'S CONCEPTION OF THE "UNIPOLAR" HEGEMONISTIC </p><p>STRIVINGS OF THE UNITED STATES -- OF WHICH HE SEES PLAN </p><p>COLOMBIA AS A PARTICULARLY CLEAR EXAMPLE -- MAKE US ABOUT </p><p>THE LAST SOURCE OF ADVICE HE IS LIKELY TO TURN TO FOR </p><p>MANAGING RELATIONS WITH COLOMBIA OR DEALING WITH THE </p><p>GUERILLAS (OR JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER). </p><p>IN SHAPING HIS POLICIES TOWARDS COLOMBIA HE WILL CONTINUE - </p><p>- AT THE PRICE, WHICH HE SEEMS WILLING TO PAY, OF LIKELY </p><p>FUTURE CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE GOC -- TO FOLLOW HIS </p><p>BOLIVARIAN VISION.  IT IS A VISION IN WHICH OUR COUNSEL HAS </p><p>NO PLACE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HRINAK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
