<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 002800 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:DECL: 1.6X1, 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PNAT, MOPS, NI, CM, PTBS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA -- DEFENSE MINISTER DANJUMA TALKS </p><p>TOUGH TO THE FRENCH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2787 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS: </p><p>1.6X1, 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) Summary: During a September 23-24 </p><p>Invitational Visit to EUCOM headquarters, Nigerian </p><p>Defense Minister T.Y. Danjuma castigated the French </p><p>for allegedly supporting Cameroon in the Bakassi </p><p>dispute. A close confidante of President Obasanjo, </p><p>Danjuma implied that Nigeria might nationalize French </p><p>oil companies if the Bakassi flared because of </p><p>Cameroonian reluctance, due to French support, to </p><p>negotiate a political solution.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) During meetings with EUCOM DCINC, Nigerian </p><p>Defense Minister talked expansively about the Bakassi. </p><p>Danjuma asserted that the Bakassi was Nigerian </p><p>territory and that Nigeria had the stronger legal </p><p>case. Dismissing the legal significance of the 1913 </p><p>Anglo-German treaty that ceded Bakassi to Germany, </p><p>Danjuma claimed that the treaty is a nullity. As a </p><p>"protecting power," the U.K. lacked authority, under </p><p>international law, to dispose of the territory of the </p><p>Obong of Calabar, the traditional ruler whose </p><p>territory included Bakassi. (Comment: Most Nigerians </p><p>embrace it as an article of national faith that </p><p>Bakassi is theirs and that their case is legally and </p><p>morally unassailable. While hard for outsiders to </p><p>understand why Nigerians cannot see the weakness of </p><p>their case, it is even more psychologically difficult </p><p>for Nigerians to see that the Cameroonian position has </p><p>merit. This inability to make an objective appraisal </p><p>leads Nigerians to believe that an adverse ICJ verdict </p><p>would be an injustice engineered by another country </p><p>wanting to undermine Nigeria\'s national interests and </p><p>steal its oil wealth.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Danjuma was surprisingly open about </p><p>Nigeria\'s pique at perceived French support for </p><p>Cameroon in the dispute over the Bakassi peninsula. </p><p>Danjuma had accompanied President Obasanjo to Paris </p><p>for the September 5 meeting with Cameroon\'s President </p><p>Biya. Despite the positive public spin placed on the </p><p>meeting, the Nigerian side was dissatisfied. It could </p><p>not extract from Biya what it most wanted: an </p><p>agreement to suspend the ICJ case so the sides could </p><p>negotiate a political settlement.  Obasanjo directed </p><p>Danjuma to remain in Paris to express Nigerian </p><p>displeasure to TotalFina/ ELF management. In his </p><p>meeting with company executives, Danjuma told us that </p><p>he complained the GOF was encouraging Biya\'s </p><p>intransigence toward negotiations with Nigeria on </p><p>Bakassi. He also told the French oilmen that France </p><p>was providing military assistance to strengthen </p><p>Cameroonian resolve over Bakassi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) Danjuma warned the businessmen that </p><p>continued French instigation of Cameroon\'s attitude </p><p>would be a serious challenge to Franco-Nigerian </p><p>relations. Alluding to the nationalization of British </p><p>Petroleum in 1977 due to South Africa and British </p><p>support for Rhodesia, Danjuma clearly implied that the </p><p>GON was contemplating taking the same action against </p><p>France\'s biggest oil company unless France assumed a </p><p>more helpful, or at least, a neutral role in the </p><p>Bakassi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) COMMENT: The Nigerians intend Danjuma\'s </p><p>comments to reach the French government, and Danjuma </p><p>probably expects us to raise this with the French as </p><p>well. Apparently, the Nigerians believe the best way </p><p>to get to Biya is by pressuring Paris, and some of </p><p>Danjuma\'s remarks were probably bluster intended to </p><p>achieve the desired effect. Even if nationalization of </p><p>TotalFina/ELF assets is improbable, the GON could </p><p>easily exclude the oil major and other French firms </p><p>from participation in future oil ventures in Nigeria. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Cameroonian FM visited Nigeria for the </p><p>Independence Day celebrations and reportedly came with </p><p>a special message from Biya. The Nigerians now seem to </p><p>be following a strategy of private tough talk coupled </p><p>with conciliatory public posturing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
