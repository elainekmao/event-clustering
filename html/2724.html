ROME 1206 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 721 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MC THOMAS COUNTRYMAN  REASON: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01725  080532Z </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) AMBASSADOR SEMBLER ACCOMPANIED CODEL YOUNG TO AN </p><p>APRIL 4 MEETING WITH PM BERLUSCONI, JUST HOURS AFTER THE PM </p><p>RETURNED FROM HIS MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN IN MOSCOW AND </p><p>SOCHI.  FOLLOWING THE MEETING, BERLUSCONI PULLED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ASIDE TO MAKE A "PERSONAL REQUEST" TO PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH ON NATO-RUSSIA MATTERS.  BERLUSCONI SAID PUTIN NEEDS US </p><p>HELP IN BUILDING RUSSIAN PUBLIC OPINION TO SUPPORT NATO </p><p>ENLARGEMENT, AS WELL AS HELP WITH THE "NATO AT 20" CONCEPT. </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND PUTIN\'S DOMESTIC </p><p>REQUIREMENTS, THE PRIME MINISTER SAID.  PUTIN NEEDS TO BE </p><p>SEEN AS PART OF THE NATO FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MAKING HIS REQUEST MORE SPECIFIC, BERLUSCONI SAID THAT </p><p>PUTIN HAD PHONED PRESIDENT BUSH, WITH BERLUSCONI IN THE ROOM, </p><p>TO URGE THAT NEGOTIATIONS ON A NEW NATO-RUSSIA RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BE ACCELERATED, SO THAT A NATO-RUSSIA AGREEMENT COULD BE </p><p>SIGNED IN ROME ON MAY 29 OR 30.  BERLUSCONI SAID THAT PUTIN </p><p>HAD TOLD HIM THAT PRESIDENT BUSH WAS CONSIDERING THE REQUEST. </p><p> THE PM ASKED THE AMBASSADOR TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST WITH THE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN AN APRIL 5 DISCUSSION WITH POL-MC, BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISER, ANTONIO CASTELLANETA, EXPANDED ON THE </p><p>REASONS FOR THE PM\'S REQUEST.  PUTIN HAD SAID IN SOCHI THAT </p><p>IT WAS NOT POLITICALLY POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GO TO THE PRAGUE </p><p>SUMMIT IN THE ABSENCE OF AN AGREEMENT ON A NEW NATO-RUSSIA </p><p>PARTNERSHIP.  PUTIN HAD SAID THAT A SEPARATE SUMMIT, SHOWING </p><p>THE NEW RELATIONSHIP TO BE AS IMPORTANT TO NATO AS EXPANSION, </p><p>WOULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR HIM.  ACCORDING TO CASTELLANETA, </p><p>BERLUSCONI BELIEVED THAT HIS VISIT THIS WEEK WAS THE MOST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01725  080532Z </p><p>IMPORTANT ITALIAN-RUSSIAN BILATERAL MEETING "EVER," AND </p><p>REINFORCED HIS DETERMINATION TO ASSIST PUTIN IN DRAWING </p><p>CLOSER TO THE WEST.  (DETAILED READOUT OF VISIT FOLLOWS </p><p>SEPTEL). </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST: WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN </p><p>WHETHER A SEPARATE BUSH-PUTIN MEETING </p><p>IN ROME IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR PUTIN OR FOR BERLUSCONI. </p><p>EMBASSY IS AWARE THAT THE DEPUTIES HAD </p><p>DISCUSSED AND NOT SUPPORTED THE ITALIAN PROPOSAL FOR A </p><p>SEPARATE NATO-RUSSIA SUMMIT PRIOR </p><p>TO PRAGUE SUMMIT.  WE WOULD APPRECIATE WASHINGTON GUIDANCE ON </p><p>HOW WE SHOULD RESPOND TO PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S REQUESTS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01725 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
