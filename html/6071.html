O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Econ 101 for Mugabe\'s Finance Minister </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) We have learned of an exchange between Finance </p><p>Minister Herbert Murerwa and Dairiboard CEO Anthony </p><p>Mandiwanza.  14 CEOs had recently called on Murerwa to </p><p>plead for an end to the GOZ\'s convoluted macroeconomic </p><p>policies.  The Finance Minister began the session by </p><p>apologizing that his office was unable to purchase milk </p><p>for the tea and coffee on the table.  Dairiboard\'s </p><p>Mandiwanza, who also heads the Confederation of </p><p>Industries, seized the moment and suggested that milkless </p><p>beverages should be the meeting\'s first topic.  He </p><p>explained that firms he represents pay farmers </p><p>Z$120/liter for milk.  On average, each liter carries an </p><p>additional Z$200 of overhead by the time it reaches the </p><p>retail market.  "That\'s why, Mr. Minister," he concluded, </p><p>"your staff can\'t get a liter of milk at the controlled </p><p>price of Z$80." </p><p> </p><p>2.
