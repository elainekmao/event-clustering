<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 HARARE 002211 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ROME PASS TO AMBASSADOR TONY HALL, MAX FINBERG, </p><p>  AND TIM LAVELLE AT FODAG </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR DCHA, OFDA, FFP AND AFR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  Press Conference Briefing Notes for </p><p>Ambassador Tony Hall\'s visit to Zimbabwe, </p><p>October 8 - October 11, 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The following offers briefing notes for </p><p>Ambassador Hall\'s press conference in Harare, Zimbabwe, </p><p>scheduled for Friday morning, 11 October 2002.  The </p><p>press conference will be held at the conclusion of </p><p>Ambassador Hall\'s visit to Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Goal of the Press Conference: </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The ideal headline the day after the press </p><p>conference would be along the following lines: "Food </p><p>Crisis Worsens - Hall Urges Policy Changes and More </p><p>International Support."  We hope you can convey the </p><p>urgency you and the USG feel in addressing the crisis </p><p>and the critical importance of urgent GOZ accompanying </p><p>actions.  The field trips you will take will give you </p><p>additional information to provide a real-life </p><p>perspective on the humanitarian crisis.  Below is some </p><p>background information for the press briefing and </p><p>questions and answers on specific issues that may arise. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Scene Setter and Suggested Media Themes: </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Press Conference will be held in the </p><p>auditorium of the Public Affairs Section\'s (PAS) </p><p>offices.  PAS has separate offices from the Embassy and </p><p>is located in the city center near the Meikles Hotel. </p><p>We expect a minimum of 12 to 15 journalists.  Ambassador </p><p>Hall and Ambassador Sullivan, will be seated at a draped </p><p>table in front of the black backdrop with the US and </p><p>Zimbabwean flags behind them.  The press will be seated </p><p>in a semicircle facing the principals.  The effect </p><p>sought is "conversational," that is, something less </p><p>formal than a stand-at-the-podium-style press </p><p>conference. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Public Affairs Officer, Bruce Wharton, will </p><p>introduce you (we will also distribute copies of your </p><p>bio) and you will be expected to make an opening </p><p>statement prior to taking questions.  In your opening </p><p>statement, we suggest you speak about your field visits </p><p>and highlight the following themes: </p><p> </p><p>1)   Zimbabwe\'s food crisis is becoming increasingly </p><p>severe. </p><p> </p><p>2)   The Government of Zimbabwe should make policy </p><p>decisions to permit the private sector and a larger </p><p>number of NGOs to play a role in addressing the nation\'s </p><p>food needs. </p><p> </p><p>3)   Among the policy issues we believe are exacerbating </p><p>the food crisis are the Grain Marketing Board\'s monopoly </p><p>on grain imports and sales, unrealistically low price </p><p>controls on staple foods, ponderous bureaucratic </p><p>procedures for clearing donated food through Zimbabwean </p><p>customs, and limitations on the NGOs permitted to </p><p>participate in food distribution programs. </p><p> </p><p>4)   The United States has been the principal donor to </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s food crisis, with generous contributions also </p><p>coming from the United Kingdom and the European Union. </p><p>Additional assistance from other donors is needed to </p><p>meet Zimbabwe\'s food needs. </p><p> </p><p>5)   While Southern Africa\'s drought is a factor in the </p><p>food crisis, the Government of Zimbabwe needs to face </p><p>the fact that it also bears responsibility for the </p><p>situation.  Macroeconomic mismanagement (including </p><p>deficit spending, a grossly overvalued currency, </p><p>multiple exchange rates, and unrealistic price </p><p>controls), a violent and chaotic land redistribution </p><p>program that has badly damaged the nation\'s agricultural </p><p>sector, and a disregard for the rule of law that has </p><p>driven foreign investment away, have all played a </p><p>substantial role in creating conditions under which more </p><p>than half of all Zimbabweans need food aid. </p><p> </p><p>6)   The United States will not politicize its food </p><p>assistance to Zimbabwe.  In spite of our serious </p><p>concerns about the actions and policies of the </p><p>Zimbabwean government, we will not abandon the people of </p><p>Zimbabwe at this time of need. </p><p> </p><p>7)   We are working closely with the World Food Program </p><p>and our bilateral NGO partners to make sure that the </p><p>food we provide is distributed on a non-partisan basis. </p><p> </p><p>8)   The food crisis will also significantly aggravate </p><p>the health conditions for people who are HIV positive </p><p>and people living with AIDS.  Zimbabwe is at the </p><p>epicenter of the epidemic with the second highest HIV </p><p>prevalence in the world - 35%.  It is estimated that </p><p>over 2,000 people a week are dying from complications </p><p>due to AIDS in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Background on the Media: </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Zimbabwean media are deeply polarized.  The </p><p>privately owned media are generally critical of the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe and sympathetic to U.S. policy </p><p>and programs in Zimbabwe.  The state-owned media are </p><p>slavishly pro-Government and reflect the GOZ\'s distrust </p><p>of the West.  Both media camps will distort stories to </p><p>reflect their points of view, but distortions in the </p><p>private media are generally less extreme.  Zimbabwean </p><p>journalists from both camps are polite and not terribly </p><p>aggressive.  International media will also be present </p><p>and will be important for re-broadcast into Zimbabwe as </p><p>well as for the international audience. Specifically, </p><p>we expect representatives from the Associated Press, </p><p>Reuters, Agence France Presse, Voice of America, the </p><p>South African Broadcasting Company (SABC), the Times of </p><p>London and the Guardian to be present. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) has deliberately </p><p>and successfully limited media freedom and the flow of </p><p>information into and out of Zimbabwe.   The majority of </p><p>Zimbabweans must rely on heavily propagandistic </p><p>government media for news and analysis of local and </p><p>international events.  The flow of news out of Zimbabwe </p><p>has been restricted through the expulsion of once- </p><p>resident foreign journalists and refusals to grant visas </p><p>to international journalists wishing to visit. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Radio is the most influential medium in Zimbabwe. </p><p>The GoZ has a monopoly on local broadcast media and they </p><p>offer only unrelenting pro-government propaganda.  One </p><p>independent broadcaster, Voice of the People, maintained </p><p>offices in Zimbabwe and provided news and information </p><p>via Dutch short wave facilities until its Harare office </p><p>was completely destroyed by a sophisticated firebombing </p><p>in late August 2002.  Another short wave broadcaster, </p><p>Short Wave Radio Africa, provides news and information </p><p>from studios in the United Kingdom.  Anecdotal </p><p>information indicates that short wave broadcasters have </p><p>only small audiences. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Urban Zimbabweans have access to a courageous </p><p>independent press consisting of one daily and three </p><p>weeklies (the Daily News, Financial Gazette, Zimbabwe </p><p>Independent, and the Standard).   Prices, logistical </p><p>challenges, and the fact that pro-government forces have </p><p>banned the distribution of independent newspapers in </p><p>rural areas means that most rural Zimbabweans (60% of </p><p>the population) have no access to these publications. </p><p>The independent press is under steady pressure from the </p><p>GoZ and pro-government forces.  Arrests of editors and </p><p>reporters are common and the Daily News has twice been </p><p>bombed, most recently in January 2001 in a sophisticated </p><p>attack that completely destroyed the paper\'s presses. </p><p>No arrests have been made.  The Daily News recently </p><p>replaced its presses.  A new media registration law, to </p><p>come into force later this year, is likely to result in </p><p>increased arrests and harassment of journalists working </p><p>for the independent press. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) The GoZ owns and exercises tight editorial </p><p>control over two dailies and three weeklies (the Herald, </p><p>Chronicle, Sunday Mail, Sunday News and Manica Post). </p><p>Although the circulation of these papers has seen a </p><p>steady decline, they are generally the only newspapers </p><p>available in rural Zimbabwe.  There is a distinct double </p><p>standard in the application of media control laws to the </p><p>independent and government-owned media. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Over the last 18 months, non-Zimbabweans working </p><p>for the BBC, Agence France Presse, the Mail and Guardian </p><p>(South Africa) and other international media have been </p><p>forced to leave the country.  BBC has explicitly been </p><p>banned.  The new media registration law is likely to </p><p>result in the closure of the Associated Press, Reuters </p><p>and AFP bureaus in Zimbabwe, all currently staffed by </p><p>Zimbabwean citizens.   The GoZ routinely denies visas to </p><p>journalists who openly apply to visit the country for </p><p>reporting purposes. </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Questions & Answers: </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. Question: </p><p> </p><p>What do you see as the critical challenges the GOZ and </p><p>donors face in dealing with the humanitarian crisis? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>One of the biggest challenges being faced right now is </p><p>NGO capacity to efficiently and effectively distribute </p><p>food aid.  The World Food Program (WFP) needs to </p><p>increase the number of NGOs who can deliver food aid </p><p>and, in this regard, the GOZ must expeditiously review </p><p>and process NGO registration applications to improve </p><p>WFP\'s ability to distribute food to vulnerable </p><p>Zimbabweans.  The second challenge relates to the amount </p><p>of available food.  The latest Vulnerability Assessment </p><p>indicates that the number of people in need of food </p><p>assistance in Zimbabwe has increased from 6 million to </p><p>6.7 million; the amount of food aid requested has risen </p><p>to 486,000 mt from the initial requested amount of </p><p>453,000 mt.  The GOZ has also committed itself to import </p><p>at least 650,000 mt.  It is critical that these food </p><p>requirements be met.  Otherwise, we will experience a </p><p>severe food gap and the situation will deteriorate </p><p>rapidly. </p><p> </p><p>2. Question: </p><p> </p><p>What is the effect U.S. "sanctions" (under the Zimbabwe </p><p>Democracy and Economic Recovery Act) against Zimbabwe on </p><p>the U.S. program to respond to the humanitarian crisis? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>The United States Government is committed to providing </p><p>food assistance to help the most needy affected by the </p><p>food crisis in Zimbabwe.  We do so, however, with our </p><p>eyes open to the fact the Government of Zimbabwe bears </p><p>much of a responsibility for the growing humanitarian </p><p>crisis in Zimbabwe and the region. </p><p> </p><p>Feel free to defer the remaining part of the answer to </p><p>Ambassador Sullivan </p><p> </p><p>The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) </p><p>is not a sanctions bill.  It is a set of incentives </p><p>designed, as the New York Times reported, to "lure </p><p>Zimbabwe back to democracy."  The bill offers US$26 </p><p>million (Z$1.4 billion at the official exchange rate) to </p><p>support land reform, basic human rights and economic </p><p>development.  To gain this support, the Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe was asked to restore the rule of law; create </p><p>conditions conducive to free and fair presidential </p><p>elections; and make a commitment to an equitable, legal </p><p>and transparent land reform program inter alia. </p><p> </p><p>Since the Government of Zimbabwe chose not to accept </p><p>ZDERA\'s recommendations, in February 2002 President Bush </p><p>implemented targeted measures against a number of </p><p>selected Zimbabwean officials.  These measures include </p><p>travel and financial restrictions.  These measures do </p><p>not include any actions to hurt the people of Zimbabwe. </p><p>U.S. Government programs, including humanitarian food </p><p>donations, the Ambassador\'s Self-Help Program, HIV/Aids </p><p>prevention and treatment efforts, and educational and </p><p>cultural programs, remain intact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Question: </p><p> </p><p>Will the U.S. sanctions against Zimbabwe result in the </p><p>termination of the USAID development program? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>Feel free to defer this to Ambassador Sullivan. </p><p> </p><p>Again, I note that ZDERA does not impose any broad-based </p><p>sanctions against the people of Zimbabwe.  Rather, it </p><p>targets senior members of the government of Robert </p><p>Mugabe and other Zimbabwean nationals who formulate, </p><p>implement or benefit from policies that undermine or </p><p>injure Zimbabwean democratic institutions.  ZDERA also </p><p>affects persons who, through their business dealings </p><p>with Zimbabwean government officials, derive significant </p><p>financial benefits from policies that undermine or </p><p>injure Zimbabwe\'s democratic institutions.  Spouses of </p><p>affected persons also face travel restrictions. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government remains committed to assisting the </p><p>people of Zimbabwe in their hour of need and will not </p><p>curtail humanitarian assistance as a result of ZDERA. </p><p> </p><p>4. Question: </p><p> </p><p>What is the USG\'s position regarding allegations of </p><p>partisanship or political manipulation in the </p><p>distribution of food? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>The United States condemns the political manipulation of </p><p>food aid.  Although to the best of our knowledge there </p><p>has been no interference with USG-donated food, many </p><p>credible reports exist of politicization of GOZ-supplied </p><p>food.  We are deeply concerned about such allegations </p><p>and urge the Government of Zimbabwe to work </p><p>collaboratively with the UN and the international </p><p>community to assure that all food is distributed in an </p><p>impartial and transparent manner. </p><p> </p><p>5. Question: </p><p> </p><p>Why is the U.S. providing biotech food to Zimbabwe and </p><p>what effect will this have on the USG\'s ability to </p><p>respond to the humanitarian crisis?  Why can\'t the U.S. </p><p>simply sign the GM certificates requested by the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe?  The USG keeps saying that </p><p>"there is no evidence that biotech food is harmful," but </p><p>that is not the same as saying that biotech food is </p><p>guaranteed to be safe.  The issues of transgenic </p><p>mutation and unintended side effects do not seem </p><p>completely resolved.  Why can\'t the US avoid these </p><p>concerns by providing non-biotech maize, or providing </p><p>money so that relief agencies can buy non-biotech maize </p><p>from other sources? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>To begin with, we are very pleased that the Government </p><p>of Zimbabwe and WFP have worked out an arrangement for </p><p>the acceptance of the first shipment of whole kernel </p><p>biotech maize.  We urge that this agreement be followed </p><p>quickly by others to accept all the food that we are </p><p>prepared to donate to alleviate the food crisis in </p><p>Zimbabwe. We believe this arrangement recognizes that </p><p>the food provided by the U.S. to Zimbabwe is the same as </p><p>that consumed by Americans.  Biotech crops are subject </p><p>to a rigorous safety review by the USDA, FDA, and EPA. </p><p>The food is eaten by millions of Americans and to date </p><p>no evidence has shown any negative health implications. </p><p>This has been stated categorically by the WHO and WFP. </p><p>Countries all over the world, including South Africa, </p><p>China and Brazil, produce biotech food.  This advanced </p><p>technology has helped make seeds more resistant to such </p><p>ravages as pests and drought, and holds great promise </p><p>for increased agricultural productivity in Africa. </p><p> </p><p>6. Question: </p><p> </p><p>What is the U.S. position on the causes of the current </p><p>food crisis in Zimbabwe?  What should the GOZ be doing </p><p>to address the crisis? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>The food crisis in Zimbabwe is highly complex and </p><p>multifaceted.  Although the regional drought has </p><p>undoubtedly been a real factor in the food shortages in </p><p>Zimbabwe, the situation has been greatly exacerbated by </p><p>the policies and actions of the Government of Zimbabwe. </p><p>Shortfalls in agricultural production in Zimbabwe -- due </p><p>in very large measure to government-sponsored, chaotic, </p><p>and often violent seizures of commercial farms and </p><p>failed economic policies -- are having a direct impact </p><p>on food availability and prices throughout the region. </p><p>Other counterproductive Government of Zimbabwe policies </p><p>-- such as the GMB monopoly on grain imports, price </p><p>controls and unrealistic exchange rates -- have </p><p>hamstrung the private sector and contributed to the food </p><p>crisis.  Foreign exchange shortages - themselves a </p><p>result of counterproductive government policies - also </p><p>limit Zimbabwe\'s ability to procure and import food and </p><p>essential agricultural commodities.  All of these issues </p><p>also affect Zimbabwe\'s ability to resume agricultural </p><p>production and, hence, mitigate the crisis. </p><p> </p><p>The United States Government will continue to provide </p><p>food assistance to help the most needy affected by the </p><p>food crisis in Zimbabwe, but we do so with our eyes open </p><p>to the fact that the Government of Zimbabwe bears much </p><p>of the responsibility for the growing humanitarian </p><p>crisis in Zimbabwe and the region.  The GOZ urgently </p><p>needs to address the policy problems that have </p><p>substantially contributed to this crisis, carry through </p><p>on its commitment to import food and distribute food in </p><p>an equitable and transparent manner with need as the </p><p>only criterion. </p><p> </p><p>7. Question: </p><p> </p><p>How much has the U.S. given in food assistance to </p><p>Zimbabwe?  Why is the USG doing so much to provide food </p><p>to Zimbabwe even as it criticizes the GOZ so harshly? </p><p>Don\'t you think that your food assistance may be helping </p><p>the government of Robert Mugabe to remain in power? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>To date, the U.S. has approved the provision of 106,630 </p><p>MTs of food assistance (valued at US$56 million) to </p><p>Zimbabwe (approximately 43,000MT has arrived in country </p><p>to date).  Within the southern African region, Zimbabwe </p><p>is the country that is most severely affected by the </p><p>current food crisis.  The people and government of the </p><p>United States are strongly committed to providing </p><p>substantial resources to Zimbabwe to respond to this </p><p>crisis.  Yes, the GOZ bears much of the responsibility </p><p>for the crisis, but we will not abandon the Zimbabweans </p><p>who are suffering because of the actions of their </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>8. Question: </p><p> </p><p>What is the U.S. position on land reform in Zimbabwe and </p><p>why hasn\'t the U.S. lived up to its commitments to </p><p>support land reform made at the Lancaster House </p><p>negotiations in 1979 and the 1998 donors\' conference? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. believes that land reform in Zimbabwe should be </p><p>implemented in transparent, equitable and consultative </p><p>manner in accordance with the rule of law.  That means </p><p>it should be done without the illegal occupation of </p><p>farms, violence, or the displacement of farm laborers. </p><p>The U.S. did not commit, at the Lancaster House </p><p>negotiations or otherwise, to provide funds for the </p><p>purchase of land.  Since 1980, however, we have provided </p><p>millions of dollars of assistance to the agricultural </p><p>sector, including funding for Zimbabwe to benefit from </p><p>the expertise of the University of Wisconsin\'s Land </p><p>Tenure Center, which is widely recognized as the </p><p>preeminent center of expertise in land reform from its </p><p>30 years of work throughout the world.  The USG also </p><p>committed at the 1998 Donors\' Conference to support a </p><p>transparent, sustainable and lawfully executed land </p><p>redistribution program; the GOZ instead decided to carry </p><p>out a land redistribution program in a manner which </p><p>violated every one of these principles. </p><p> </p><p>9. Question: </p><p> </p><p>What support is the USG/USAID providing to Zimbabwean </p><p>civil society, especially those involved in promoting </p><p>democratic values? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>Feel free to defer to Ambassador Sullivan. </p><p> </p><p>In 1998, we entered into a grant agreement with </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe that established a program to </p><p>support Zimbabwean civil society.  A big component of </p><p>this program involves finding ways to improve dialogue </p><p>between Parliament and civil society. </p><p>10. Question: </p><p> </p><p>What is your response to rumors that the Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe is preparing new legislation to enable it to </p><p>have greater influence on the operations of PVOs? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>I have not seen the new legislation that you are </p><p>referring to and, therefore, I cannot comment on it. </p><p>Having said that, in general we believe it is important </p><p>for the Government of Zimbabwe to create an environment </p><p>in which NGOs can effectively carry out their critical </p><p>roles as part of civil society, including participating </p><p>in the distribution of emergency assistance during the </p><p>current humanitarian crisis.  We all know the </p><p>tremendously helpful roles that NGO\'s, such as World </p><p>Vision, Care, CRS and many others, have played here in </p><p>Zimbabwe in delivering food assistance, working on </p><p>health and HIV-AIDS projects and many other areas.  We </p><p>certainly would hope that the GOZ not deal with NGO\'s as </p><p>an enemy to to be hamstrung but as a key support to the </p><p>Zimbabwean people.  SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
