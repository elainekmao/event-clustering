<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004534 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>OPIC FOR WILLIAMS/KIWAN </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - DEMOPULOS </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, BEXP, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ APPROACHES CITIGROUP RE TRADE FACILITATION </p><p>MECHANISM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  During a July 22 courtesy call, Planning Minister </p><p>Awadallah passed Charge a copy of a letter from the GOJ to </p><p>Citibank Jordan GM Suhair al Ali proposing the establishment </p><p>of a trade facilitation mechanism that would protect L/C\'s </p><p>written for Jordan-Iraq commercial trade.  Awadallah said </p><p>discussions between the GOJ and Citigroup that began on the </p><p>margins of the Dead Sea WEF were continuing in London at </p><p>present, and the GOJ expected a positive response to their </p><p>proposal in the near future.  Awadallah noted that the GOJ </p><p>had proposed using OPIC facilities as one possible mechanism </p><p>for underwriting Iraq-related L/C\'s (Text of letter follows </p><p>at end of this cable, reference to OPIC para 7 of letter.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Al Ali subsequently told Econoff that Citigroup is </p><p>favorably inclined to develop such a mechanism, which they </p><p>see as benefiting both Iraq and Jordan.  She saw two possible </p><p>options for such a mechanism.  Under the first option, CPA or </p><p>another competent authority could create an escrow account in </p><p>a designated Iraqi bank (including the CBI, Rafidain, or the </p><p>newly-created Trade Bank of Iraq) which Citibank Jordan could </p><p>use to confirm outstanding L/C\'s for Jordan/Iraq trade. </p><p>Citibank would also be willing to confirm L/C\'s routed </p><p>through reputable Jordanian banks using the same escrow </p><p>account.  To do so, Citibank would need to get a feeling for </p><p>how much exposure (in terms of open L/C\'s) they should expect </p><p>at any given time for Jordan/Iraq trade.  Under the second </p><p>option, OPIC could provide guarantees through its facilities </p><p>to allow Citibank to confirm open L/C\'s related to </p><p>Jordan-Iraq trade, including those routed through Iraqi banks </p><p>if appropriate. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Al Ali said Citibank is currently meeting with </p><p>Treasury officials regarding these proposals, and would </p><p>follow up with OPIC in the near future.  She said this </p><p>proposal would be a win-win for the region, stimulating </p><p>bilateral trade by boosting business confidence and </p><p>continuing to develop the long-standing traditional ties </p><p>between Iraq and Jordan.  Such a program would have positive </p><p>effects, she noted, in many Jordanian economic sectors - from </p><p>banking to trade to manufacturing. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Comment:  We echo al Ali\'s comments as to the </p><p>positive impact such a mechanism would create to stimulate </p><p>trade between Jordan and Iraq.  Many private sector contacts, </p><p>including regional visitors to Jordan, have commented that </p><p>the only thing keeping them from entering the Iraqi economy </p><p>is a measure of financial protection to cover their trade </p><p>activities.  Instituting a program like that proposed by the </p><p>GOJ could well stimulate trade and encourage private sector </p><p>investors to pursue similar arrangements to encourage the </p><p>flow of new investment into Iraq.  The knock-on benefits of </p><p>such an arrangement to Jordan\'s financial sector, </p><p>transportation sector, and (to a lesser extent) manufacturing </p><p>sector could also be significant in a relatively short </p><p>time-frame.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Begin text of GOJ letter to Citibank Jordan: </p><p> </p><p>(complimentary opening) </p><p> </p><p>Reference is made to the meeting of His Majesty King Abdullah </p><p>II with Mr. William Rhodes and the accompanying Citigroup </p><p>delegation, during the meetings of the extraordinary summit </p><p>of the World Economic Forum at the Dead Sea on 22 June, 2003, </p><p>and to subsequent meetings that were held between the </p><p>Minister of Planning, Dr. Bassem Awadallah, and members of </p><p>the senior management of Citigroup. </p><p> </p><p>During these meetings, discussion focused on exploring </p><p>possible means to leverage and build on the long standing </p><p>business and economic ties that Jordan maintained with Iraq, </p><p>in order to position Jordan as a key gateway for the </p><p>re-construction and long term development of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Jordan\'s experience in economic relations with Iraq has been </p><p>successful in all measures extending over most economic </p><p>activities and withstanding numerous political and economic </p><p>hurdles.  Iraq has been and continues to be one of Jordan\'s </p><p>most important trade partners.  Furthermore, Iraq has been </p><p>the biggest supplier of oil to Jordan, giving our economic </p><p>relations a significant strategic dimension. </p><p> </p><p>The Aqaba Port has been over the years the main port for </p><p>supplying goods to Iraq.  The infrastructure of the port, the </p><p>availability of spare capacity and the high efficiency in </p><p>moving goods equips the port to maintain its role as the main </p><p>hub for moving goods into Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>The reliability of our banking sector was one of the most </p><p>important elements in considering Jordan as a hub for doing </p><p>business with Iraq.  This is evident by the re-export figures </p><p>of foreign-originating goods which was around $210 million in </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>Jordan\'s future economic relations with Iraq are expected to </p><p>grow even further.  Since the end of war activities, </p><p>Jordanian exports to Iraq have witnessed a steady growth, </p><p>totaling around $85 million, a testament to the strength of </p><p>our relations and the good positioning of Jordanian goods in </p><p>the Iraqi market. </p><p> </p><p>It is within this context that the Government of Jordan would </p><p>like to seek the assistance of Citigroup in setting up a </p><p>trade mechanism that would enable Citigroup in Jordan as well </p><p>as a number of select fine Jordanian banks to confirm Letters </p><p>of Credit opened by the Central Bank of Iraq and/or Rafidain </p><p>Bank, or any other bank in Iraq nominated by the Coalition </p><p>Provisional Authority (CPA) for the import of goods into </p><p>Iraq.  Such a mechanism may be protected against either cash </p><p>collateral to be held in Jordan, and/or guarantees </p><p>established by multilateral agencies.  To facilitate this </p><p>trade flow, it is important that we put this in place as soon </p><p>as possible. </p><p> </p><p>(complimentary closing) </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>6.
