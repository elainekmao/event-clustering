<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0013 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>JANUARY 14, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for January 14, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for </p><p>the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  BASES UNDER SCRUTINY </p><p>(Radikal/Milliyet/Milli Gazete)  In line with an </p><p>agreement between Turkey and the U.S., a 150-person </p><p>U.S. military delegation began to survey bases and </p><p>airports (in Turkey).  A team that had come from </p><p>Germany to Ankara and Incirlik (Adana) is reported </p><p>to have begun its survey of Diyarbakir, Mus, and </p><p>Batman bases, as well as the ports of Mersin, and </p><p>Iskenderun (Hatay).  The Incirlik team reportedly </p><p>obtained information on whether or not construction </p><p>projects will be carried out in areas they </p><p>surveyed.  The team will leave the base after </p><p>selecting the most convenient place on the base for </p><p>unloading troops and ammunition and obtaining a </p><p>construction permit.  Cumhuriyet claimed that 300 </p><p>million USD had been allocated for possible </p><p>upgrading that might enter the agenda based on the </p><p>delegation\'s findings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  ALLEGATIONS THAT U.S. WILL RECRUIT MERCENARIES </p><p>(Turkiye)  While preparations continue for a </p><p>possible U.S. operation against Iraq, rumors that </p><p>the U.S. would hire mercenaries began to circulate </p><p>in Silopi (Sirnak).  After the war, mercenaries </p><p>would reportedly be given U.S. citizenship. </p><p>Hearing the rumors, many Silopi residents rushed to </p><p>apply to the offices of muhktars (village chiefs) </p><p>who called the allegations baseless. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  PLANE CRASH PILOT ERROR </p><p>(All papers)  In a January 13 press conference, </p><p>Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim gave </p><p>information regarding the preliminary report on the </p><p>plane that crashed in Diyarbakir on January 8. </p><p>Yildirim said an investigation continued with the </p><p>participation of a six-person team from the U.K., </p><p>which had manufactured the plane.  A preliminary </p><p>investigation showed: </p><p>? the pilot was not fully aware of the plane\'s </p><p>position; </p><p>? the pilots had not seen the runway although </p><p>the plane had descended to the minimum </p><p>altitude; and </p><p>? the flying team had not requested any radar </p><p>assistance. </p><p>Turkiye quoted the Istanbul Medical Department </p><p>President, Professor Oguz Polat, as announcing the </p><p>completion of DNA tests on the bodies of 18 of the </p><p>39 victims who could not be identified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  SEVENTEEN HIZBULLAH SUSPECTS ARRESTED </p><p>(Bolge/Milliyet/Turkiye/Evrensel)  According to the </p><p>Mersin Security Directorate, suspected Hizbullah </p><p>members, including four women, had been arrested in </p><p>Mersin\'s Tarsus and Camliyayla townships.  A large </p><p>quantity of organizational documents and </p><p>publications were seized.  The organization\'s </p><p>Cukurova (Adana) chief was among the arrestees </p><p>accused of providing support to Hizbullah fugitives </p><p>and their relatives, and obtaining computers to </p><p>form an archive for the organization.  Following </p><p>interrogation, the arrestees were sent to the </p><p>Prosecutor\'s Office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  SIIRT ELECTIONS POSTPONED UNTIL MARCH 9 </p><p>(Sabah/Milliyet/Turkiye/Milli Gazete)  The Higher </p><p>Election Council (YSK) decided to hold the Siirt </p><p>elections on March 9, instead of February 9, in </p><p>line with the recent amendment to the Member of </p><p>Parliament Election Law.  The postponement signaled </p><p>that obstacles to AK Party leader Recep Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan\'s candidacy to run for the Parliament from </p><p>that province would be removed.  Meanwhile, Siirt </p><p>resident Fadil Akgunduz, who lost his parliamentary </p><p>immunity when the Siirt elections were cancelled, </p><p>applied to YSK to renew his candidacy from that </p><p>province.  Radikal reported the Democratic People\'s </p><p>Party (DEHAP) had decided to participate in the </p><p>Siirt elections although it would not be able to </p><p>enter the Parliament (due to the 10% nationwide </p><p>threshold). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  ADANA FLIGHTS WILL RESUME ON JANUARY 15 </p><p>(Bolge/Milliyet)  According to Turkish Airlines </p><p>(THY), THY flights to and from Adana will resume at </p><p>midday tomorrow (1/15).  The airport has been </p><p>closed to flights since November 4 for repair and </p><p>maintenance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE HARASSMENT </p><p>(Evrensel)  Gaziantep resident Huseyin Karadag, an </p><p>official of the People\'s Democracy Party (HADEP) </p><p>Youth Commission, claimed that police officers, </p><p>disguised as electricians, postmen, and officials </p><p>of the Social Assistance and Solidarity Foundation </p><p>affiliated with the governor\'s office, had been </p><p>going to HADEP members\' homes and harassing them. </p><p>"We are fed up with being threatened and followed," </p><p>said Bircan Demir, a former HADEP official. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  COLLEGE STUDENTS PROTEST DETENTION OF THEIR </p><p>PEERS </p><p>(Evrensel)  Nearly 700 Centennial University (Van) </p><p>students staged a demonstration to protest the </p><p>detention of 47 of their peers arrested by Jandarma </p><p>for having been involved in a fight with </p><p>Nationalist Movement Party (MHP)-affiliated </p><p>thuggish ideologues.  Jandarma intervened to </p><p>disperse the protestors, arresting seven of them. </p><p>Jandarma later released the arrestees when the </p><p>protestors continued with their protest.  Later, a </p><p>group of three students was allowed to meet with </p><p>the Rector.  During the meeting, the students </p><p>demanded that their peers be released and that the </p><p>arrested students be given a second chance to take </p><p>their examinations which they were not able to </p><p>take.  The Rector reportedly pledged to give them a </p><p>second chance to take the missed exams.  Meanwhile, </p><p>65 arrestees, including leftist and rightist </p><p>students, were taken to the prosecutor\'s office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  OVER 46 KILOS OF HEROIN SEIZED IN HAKKARI </p><p>(Turkiye)  According to the Hakkari Governor\'s </p><p>Office, police seized 46.944 kilograms of heroin </p><p>concealed in secret chambers of a truck headed for </p><p>Hakkari.  The driver was arrested and then ordered </p><p>to remain in custody.  In a sting operation in </p><p>Kahramanmaras, Jandarma arrested two people looking </p><p>for customers for 2.5 kilograms of hashish and </p><p>confiscated the hashish.  Another 550 grams of </p><p>hashish were found on two Gaziantep people during </p><p>an ID check. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  FRUIT GROWING EXPANDING IN SANLIURFA </p><p>(Bolge)  In Sanliurfa, the center of the </p><p>Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP), fruit </p><p>cultivation has increased 40% with agricultural </p><p>fields having been opened to irrigation.  Fruit </p><p>cultivation expanded from 90,400 hectares (before </p><p>the irrigation projects) in 1995 to 115,005 </p><p>hectares in 2002. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
