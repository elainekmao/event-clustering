<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001256 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIRBOI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI FREE ON BAIL;  TREASON TRIAL CONTINUES </p><p>WEEKS TWELVE AND THIRTEEN </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Peggy Blackford for reasons 1.5b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) After two weeks in prison, MDC President Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai was today granted bail on fresh treason charges. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Bail conditions are high for Zimbabwe but should be doable. </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s trial on old treason charges resumed this week </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>as well.  Under cross examination Central Intelligence head </p><p>Happyton Bonyongwe confirmed that the GOZ had made </p><p>substantial payments and extended a contract to principal </p><p>government witness, Ari Ben Menashe.  The Justice presiding </p><p>over the trial appeared to come under renewed pressure from </p><p>the GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>Bail Granted </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  At the bail hearing held at nine this morning, the </p><p>court granted bail to Tsvangirai on the fresh charges of </p><p>treason which led to his arrest on June 7.  Bail was set at </p><p>Z$10 million (about US$4250), a substantial sum given the </p><p>weakness of the State\'s case and the fact that no reasonable </p><p>person would believe that someone who did not flee the </p><p>court\'s jurisdiction while undergoing one trial from treason </p><p>is likely to flee from a new trial.  He will also be required </p><p>to surrender title deeds to at least Z$100 million in </p><p>property as a surety and to refrain from advocating (or </p><p>encouraging other to pursue) the overthrow of the State </p><p>President or the government by violent means.  Tsvangirai\'s </p><p>attorney told PolOff that the party was furiously running </p><p>around to raise the bail which must be paid in cash, a </p><p>commodity that has been in short supply in Zimbabwe for some </p><p>weeks now.  Assuming the bail is raised, and we are quite </p><p>sure it will be, Tsvangirai should spend the weekend at home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Treason trial </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) After last week during which proceedings were </p><p>suspended, Tsvangirai\'s original treason case resumed this </p><p>week with the defense\'s continued cross-examination of CIO </p><p>chief Bonyongwe.  Bonyongwe revealed that the government </p><p>renewed its contract with political consultant, Ari Ben </p><p>Menashe, one of the principal witnesses against Tsvangirai </p><p>about three weeks before Menashe flew to Harare to testify </p><p>against Tsvangirai.  Ostensibly the purpose of the contract </p><p>was to boost the image of Zimbabwe internationally and to try </p><p>and solicit investment.  The GOZ was allegedly worried about </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s travels, especially to West Africa, where the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>government believed that Tsvangirai was sending out the wrong </p><p>message on the land reform program. Pressed by Tsvangirai\'s </p><p>lead attorney, George Bizos, Bonyongwe admitted that there </p><p>was nothing subversive about Tsvangirai\'s travel. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Bonyongwe also confirmed that the GOZ had paid </p><p>US$10,000 to Ben Menashe\'s personal assistant, Tara Thomas, </p><p>for injuries received as the result of a bicycle accident in </p><p>Canada  which Ben Menashe attributed to the work of </p><p>opposition Zimbabweans.  This testimony contradicts Thomas\'s </p><p>own evidence in which she claimed she had not been paid any </p><p>money by the GOZ.  Bizos also attacked the reputation of Ben </p><p>Menashe who is wanted for fraud in Zambia and reputed to have </p><p>been involved in numerous shady deals, but Bonyongwe insisted </p><p>that Ben Menashe had done good work for the GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The court room was not full this week.  Tsvangirai was </p><p>guarded by prison officials while in the witness box and </p><p>rushed away after each session.  Justice Paddington Garwe who </p><p>is presiding over the trial, appeared to be getting impatient </p><p>with advocate Bizos and kept prompting him to move on and not </p><p>repeat questions.  This is a change from previous weeks when </p><p>Garwe, if not overly sympathetic to the defense, did seem to </p><p>be impartial and may reflect additional pressure being </p><p>brought on him by the GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Any dispassionate observer would have to conclude that </p><p>the State\'s original treason case has collapsed.  The payment </p><p>of large amounts to the principal government witness just </p><p>weeks before the trial surely raises serious suspicions of </p><p>conflict of interest or outright bribery while the new </p><p>charges are so insubstantial as to be nothing more than a </p><p>pretext for locking up and humiliating Zimbabwe\'s leading </p><p>political opponent.  Unfortunately, the GOZ is anything but </p><p>dispassionate.  Nevertheless, granting bail does suggest that </p><p>the government knows that it must ultimately deal with </p><p>Tsvangirai across a bargaining table. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
