<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000602 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p>USOSCE FOR POL(HELWIG) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, PHUM, PREL, HR, HRPGOV, Political Parties/Elections </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIAN PARLIAMENT "PUNTS" ON ELECTION LAW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00602  01 OF 02  180840Z </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) POLITICAL PARTIES IN CROATIA\'S RULING COALITION COULD </p><p>NOT AGREE ON A MODEL FOR ELECTION LAW REFORM AND HAVE DECIDED </p><p>INSTEAD TO MAKE "TECHNICAL CHANGES" TO EXISTING LEGISLATION. </p><p>THE COALITION NEVER REALLY MOVED BEYOND THE THEORIZING STAGE </p><p>IN ITS EFFORTS TO CUT THE POLITICAL DEAL WHICH WOULD HAVE </p><p>BEEN NECESSARY TO CHANGE CROATIA\'S ELECTION LAW.  FOUR </p><p>SEPARATE DRAFTS WERE DEBATED IN THE PARLIAMENT, AND TWO HAVE </p><p>MOVED ON TO A SECOND READING, BUT NONE OF CROATIA\'S POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS EXPECTS EITHER OF THEM TO BECOME LAW.  WHILE CROATIA </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY OF POLITICIANS TO VOTERS, IT HAS OPTED FOR </p><p>GREATER STABILITY: THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME SINCE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE THAT GENERAL ELECTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE TWICE </p><p>UNDER THE SAME RULES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CROATIA\'S CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT ANY NEW </p><p>LEGISLATION REGULATING ELECTIONS BE ADOPTED A FULL YEAR PRIOR </p><p>TO THE DATE OF EXPECTED ELECTIONS.  BECAUSE THE CROATIAN </p><p>PARLIAMENT TOOK UP ITS MANDATE IN FEBRUARY 2000, THE LATEST </p><p>POSSIBLE DATE ELECTIONS COULD TECHNICALLY TAKE PLACE IS APRIL </p><p>2004 (SIXTY DAYS AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE CURRENT MANDATE), </p><p>WHICH MEANS THAT IF A NEW ELECTION LAW WAS TO BE PASSED </p><p>BEFORE THE DEADLINE, IT MUST MOVE QUICKLY.  WHILE THAT </p><p>DEADLINE IS CONSIDERED NON-BINDING BY SOME POLITICAL </p><p>OBSERVERS (SINCE THERE IS NO SANCTION IF IT IS MISSED), MOST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00602  01 OF 02  180840Z </p><p>OBSERVERS THINK THAT THOSE WHO WERE PRESSING FOR REFORM </p><p>MISSED THEIR CHANCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THEORIZING ABOUT HOW TO REFORM CROATIA\'S ELECTION LAW </p><p>HAS BEEN A POPULAR PASTIME IN ZAGREB, BUT THE TEMPO OF </p><p>DISCUSSION INCREASED AS THE LIKELY DATE FOR ELECTIONS DREW </p><p>NEARER.  WHILE PUBLIC STATEMENTS VARY, MOST POLITICIANS TELL </p><p>US PRIVATELY THAT THEY EXPECT ELECTIONS TO TAKE PLACE THIS </p><p>FALL, IN OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER.  THE PARLIAMENT\'S POWERFUL </p><p>COMMITTEE FOR CONSTITUTION, RULES AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS HAD </p><p>BEEN WORKING ON A VARIETY OF DRAFTS FOR NEARLY A YEAR, BUT </p><p>COULD NOT AGREE ON A SINGLE SYSTEM.  COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN MATO </p><p>ARLOVIC (SDP) DESCRIBED FOR US A COMPLICATED PROPOSAL FOR </p><p>COMBINING PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WITH DIRECT ELECTION </p><p>FROM AN OPEN LIST.  EVEN AS HE DESCRIBED THE THEORY, HE TOLD </p><p>US THAT IT HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BECOMING LAW. </p><p> </p><p>EVERYBODY\'S GOT A DRAFT ELECTION LAW </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) RATHER THAN SITTING DOWN AND AGREEING ON A </p><p>COMPROMISE SOLUTION, THE COALITION\'S TWO LARGEST PARTIES -- </p><p>THE SDP AND HSS -- FORMALLY SUBMITTED THEIR OWN SEPARATE </p><p>DRAFTS FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE PARLIAMENT.  THE OPPOSITION </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CENTER (DC - WITH ONLY THREE SEATS IN THE CURRENT </p><p>PARLIAMENT) TABLED ITS DRAFT, AND ONE MP FROM THE IDS </p><p>(ISTRIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION - A REGIONAL PARTY) AND ONE FROM </p><p>THE LS (LIBERAL PARTY - WITH FOUR SEATS) TABLED YET ANOTHER. </p><p> </p><p>MINORITY REPRESENTATION, DIASPORA, REDISTRICTING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00602  01 OF 02  180840Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) ALL OF THE SPONSORS OF THE VARIOUS DRAFTS ASSERT </p><p>THAT THEIR COMMON GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF MPS\' </p><p>DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY TO VOTERS BY LETTING VOTERS, RATHER </p><p>THAN PARTY LEADERS, DECIDE WHICH CANDIDATES FROM A PARTY LIST </p><p>SECURE SEATS IN PARLIAMENT.  WHILE THEY TREAT THE ISSUE </p><p>DIFFERENTLY, ALL OF THE DRAFTS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES.  THE DRAFTS </p><p>DIFFERED WIDELY ON HOW -- AND INTO HOW MANY DISTRICTS -- TO </p><p>DIVIDE UP THE ELECTORAL SPACE AND ALSO ON HOW TO TREAT THE </p><p>CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OF DIASPORA VOTING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) THE SDP PROPOSAL CALLED FOR CROATIA TO BE </p><p>CONSIDERED A SINGLE ELECTORAL DISTRICT, WITH CANDIDATES </p><p>CHOSEN FROM A "SEMI-OPEN" LIST.  REGIONAL AND SMALLER PARTIES </p><p>CRIED FOUL, DECLARING THAT THE SDP WAS TRYING TO "KILL THE </p><p>SMALLER PARTIES."  PARTIES MUST TAKE AT LEAST FIVE PERCENT OF </p><p>THE TOTAL VOTES CAST IN ANY ONE DISTRICT TO WIN A SHARE OF </p><p>THE SEATS IN THE PARLIAMENT FOR THAT DISTRICT, AND ONLY THE </p><p>LARGER, NATIONAL LEVEL PARTIES WOULD GET OVER THAT BAR IF THE </p><p>ENTIRE COUNTRY WAS A SINGLE DISTRICT.  THE HSS PROPOSED A </p><p>MIXED SYSTEM, WHERE HALF OF THE SABOR WOULD BE ELECTED IN 65 </p><p>WINNER-TAKE-ALL DISTRICTS, AND THE OTHER HALF IN A SINGLE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5404 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00602  02 OF 02  180841Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /007W </p><p>                  ------------------461748  180841Z /38 </p><p>P 180830Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9732 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000602 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p>USOSCE FOR POL(HELWIG) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIAN PARLIAMENT "PUNTS" ON ELECTION LAW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00602  02 OF 02  180841Z </p><p> </p><p>COUNTRY-WIDE ELECTORAL DISTRICT BASED ON PROPORTIONAL </p><p>REPRESENTATION (WITH POLITICAL PARTIES DECIDING ON CANDIDATE </p><p>LISTS). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) ALL OF THE COALITION PARTIES AGREE THAT, REGARDLESS </p><p>OF WHETHER THEY PASS A NEW LAW OR JUST TINKER WITH EXISTING </p><p>LEGISLATION, THE WAY THE CROATIAN DIASPORA IS REPRESENTED </p><p>MUST CHANGE.  CROATIA\'S CONSTITUTION GIVES CITIZENSHIP TO </p><p>ETHNIC CROATS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY RESIDE.  THE EXISTING </p><p>TUDJMAN-ERA STATUTE ALLOWS ALL CITIZENS TO VOTE, EVEN IF THEY </p><p>HAVE NEVER LIVED IN CROATIA.  THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF </p><p>ETHNIC CROATS WHO VOTED FROM ABROAD IN THE 2000 ELECTIONS </p><p>WERE HARD-LINE HDZ SUPPORTERS IN BOSNIA.  THE SDP PROPOSAL </p><p>WOULD ALLOW FOR DIASPORA VOTING, BUT WOULD REQUIRE PROOF OF </p><p>LEGAL RESIDENCE IN CROATIA FOR THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THE HSS PROPOSED TO LIMIT DIASPORA MPS TO THREE, </p><p>WITH ONE FROM EUROPE, ONE FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND </p><p>ONE REPRESENTING THE DIASPORA IN AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE IDS/LS PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THE DIASPORA ISSUE WAS </p><p>BASED ON A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH BIH ON DUAL CITIZENSHIP, </p><p>STILL TO BE NEGOTIATED.  CROATIA AND BIH CONTINUE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS AND MAY YET CONCLUDE THE AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD </p><p>PREVENT BIH CITIZENS FROM VOTING IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>ELECTIONS.  BUT HIGH REPRESENTATIVE PADDY ASHDOWN\'S JANUARY </p><p>2003 DECISION TO DELAY IMPOSING A DUAL CITIZENSHIP LAW IN BIH </p><p>MAY HAVE TAKEN THE ISSUE OFF THE FRONT BURNER. </p><p> </p><p>HDZ: WAIT AND SEE </p><p>----------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00602  02 OF 02  180841Z </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE OPPOSITION HDZ, CROATIA\'S LARGEST PARTY, HAS NOT </p><p>PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL OF ITS OWN, EVEN THOUGH IT STANDS TO </p><p>LOSE THE MOST WHEN DIASPORA VOTING RIGHTS ARE CURTAILED. HDZ </p><p>PRESIDENT SANADER\'S EARLY "SOUND BITE" ON CHANGING THE </p><p>ELECTION LAW HAS BEEN "WE\'LL WIN WITH ANY SYSTEM," ALTHOUGH </p><p>HIS PARTY STANDS TO LOSE THE MOST IF BOSNIAN CROATS ARE </p><p>RESTRICTED FROM VOTING.  A MORE LIKELY REASON FOR THE HDZ\'S </p><p>RETICENCE TO SUBMIT A DRAFT IS THAT ITS LEADERS KNOW THE </p><p>COALITION WILL VOTE DOWN ANYTHING THEY PROPOSE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 14, THE PARLIAMENT INSTRUCTED THE </p><p>COMMITTEE FOR CONSTITUTION, RULES AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS TO </p><p>PREPARE "TECHNICAL CHANGES" TO THE EXISTING ELECTION LAW IN </p><p>ORDER TO BRING IT INTO COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION AND THE NEW LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES.  IN WHAT </p><p>COULD SEEM LIKE A CONTRADICTION, THE PARLIAMENT ALSO </p><p>PERMITTED THE SDP AND HSS DRAFT ELECTION LAWS TO ADVANCE IN </p><p>THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.  NOW THAT THESE BILLS HAVE PASSED </p><p>THEIR "FIRST READING," THEY WILL BE SCHEDULED FOR A SECOND </p><p>AND FINAL DEBATE WITHIN SIX MONTHS UNLESS THEY ARE WITHDRAWN </p><p>BY THEIR SPONSORS.  ONE POLITICAL ANALYST SUGGESTED THAT THE </p><p>HSS AND SDP WANT TO KEEP THE "THREAT" TO SMALLER PARTIES </p><p>ACTIVE TO ENSURE THAT SMALLER COALITION PARTNERS SUPPORT THE </p><p>"TECHNICAL CHANGES" TO THE EXISTING LAW.  ANTE MARKOV, A </p><p>SENIOR HSS MP, TOLD US THAT THE PARLIAMENT WILL PROBABLY </p><p>AGREE TO SOME SORT OF RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT TO RESTRICT THE </p><p>DIASPORA VOTE UNTIL CLEAR RULES DEFINING DUAL NATIONALITY ARE </p><p>DEVELOPED. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00602  02 OF 02  180841Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
