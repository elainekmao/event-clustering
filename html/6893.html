(SBU)  Embassy Press Officer received a call at 2100 </p><p>local March 27 from Amcit journalist Lisa Barron, who works </p><p>for CBS Radio and is currently in Amman.  She has been in </p><p>contact with an Amcit journalist named Nate Thayer, who </p><p>writes for Slate.com and E </p><p>squire magazine and who is in </p><p>Baghdad at the Palestine hotel.  There appears to be a visa </p><p>problem.  Thayer entered on a tourist visa, but has been </p><p>filing stories for his publications.  According to Barron, </p><p>discussions appear to be ongoing as to whether Iraq will </p><p>expel Thayer, alter his visa status, or detain him. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Subsequent to this information, Embassy Crisis </p><p>Liaison Unit was contacted by James Rupert, Deputy Foreign </p><p>Editor for Newsday.  Rupert, who is in Amman, said he had </p><p>been told by the Cox News Service Baghdad correspondent, </p><p>Larry Kaplow, that two Newsday journalists had "gone </p><p>missing" from the Palestine hotel, apparently taken away by </p><p>Iraqi security officers.  The two Newsday journalists are </p><p>Matthew McAllester (a UK citizen) and Moises Saman (a </p><p>Spanish citizen).  The other three were Molly Bingham (an </p><p>Amcit freelance photographer), Philip Robert Latasa (an </p><p>Amcit peace activist), and Johan Deng Spanner (a Danish </p><p>photographer).  Embassy conveyed information in paras 8-9 </p><p>to CMS task force lJ-PA at 2130 and 23O0 local via e-mail. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  In addition to these reports, Embassy has </p><p>learned that NPR correspondent Ann Garrols has been </p><p>unheard-from for two days, according to local sources with </p><p>whom she regularly communicates. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
