WE </p><p>EXPECT THAT OTHER MFA OFFICES, THE IRANIANS, OR THE COMPANIES </p><p>INVOLVED WILL POSIT THIS KIND OF PATROLLING FUNCTION AS A </p><p>LEGITIMATE END-USE FOR THESE SPEED BOATS.  WE WOULD </p><p>APPRECIATE BENEFIT OF DEPARTMENT\'S COUNTER-ARGUMENTS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02257 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
