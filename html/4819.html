<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 009074 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/18/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CASC, PHUM, SNAR, EINV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S DEC. 17 MEETING WITH INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER AKSU </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson; reasons 1.5 b and </p><p>d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: In a December 17 meeting with new GOT </p><p>Interior Minister Aksu, Ambassador discussed anti-torture </p><p>efforts; police exchange programs; child abduction cases; </p><p>trafficking in persons; and the problems faced by Amcits </p><p>Victor and Kristy Bedoian in their efforts to operate a hotel </p><p>in Van Province.  Aksu promised cooperation on all these </p><p>issues.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Anti-Torture Efforts </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador praised recent GOT human rights reform </p><p>steps, including reforms designed to crack down on torture by </p><p>police.  Aksu\'s and others\' strong statements condemning the </p><p>use of torture have caught our attention.  Such statements </p><p>and strong anti-torture support by the GOT will help the </p><p>Turkish police adhere to the highest standards.  Aksu stated </p><p>that he never tolerated torture in past stints as a minister, </p><p>governor, sub governor, and police chief, and will not do so </p><p>now.  The GOT has passed all the necessary anti-torture </p><p>measures; now it\'s a question of thorough implementation.  If </p><p>some local officials are not cracking down on the practice, </p><p>they will be investigated.  On December 20 the Interior </p><p>Ministry will hold the first in a series of planned meetings </p><p>with local government officials and party leaders from across </p><p>the country.  The meetings will focus on the implementation </p><p>of the latest reform legislation.  If there are </p><p>inconsistencies in the implementation of the new laws, </p><p>including those related to torture, these will be addressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Police Exchange Programs </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador noted the success of U.S.-Turkey police </p><p>exchange programs; 20 Turkish National Police (TNP) officers </p><p>have been sent to the FBI Academy for training since 1999. </p><p>The U.S. would like to continue and expand such efforts. </p><p>Aksu said he promoted such exchanges with the U.S. during a </p><p>previous stint as Interior Minister in 1988-91.  He has sent </p><p>Turkish security officials to the U.S. for a variety of </p><p>programs, including English language, forensics, hostage </p><p>rescue, and close protection training.  In many cases, these </p><p>officers have earned degrees from U.S. academies, and some </p><p>have trained other officers on their return to Turkey.  Aksu </p><p>has traveled to the U.S. to meet with high-level State </p><p>Department, FBI, and DEA officials.  He said he is </p><p>particularly interested in enhancing cooperation with the </p><p>U.S. on anti-narcotics training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Child Abduction </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador asked for Aksu\'s support in handling child </p><p>abduction cases.  Under the Hague Convention, children who </p><p>are abducted and taken from a country in the midst of a </p><p>custody dispute should be returned to that country so a court </p><p>can rule on custody.  There are cases of children being </p><p>abducted both from the U.S. to Turkey and from Turkey to the </p><p>U.S.  Aksu said it is the GOT\'s responsibility to comply with </p><p>the Hague Convention, and he will ensure the Interior </p><p>Ministry does its part. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Trafficking in Persons </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador said the Embassy is eager to continue close </p><p>cooperation with the GOT on trafficking in persons (TIP). </p><p>The GOT has made recent progress, and the USG wants to help </p><p>Turkey rise from Category III to Category II in the State </p><p>Department\'s annual TIP report.  Aksu said he is aware of the </p><p>issue, and believes Turkey must meet EU and U.S. standards in </p><p>implementing international conventions against human </p><p>trafficking.  He noted that the GOT in August passed reform </p><p>legislation specifically designating human trafficking as a </p><p>crime and establishing stiff prison terms for violators. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Bedoian Case </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador told Aksu Amcits Victor and Kristy Bedoian </p><p>continue to face obstacles from local authorities in their </p><p>efforts to operate a hotel they own in Van Province.  We </p><p>would appreciate anything Aksu could do to help resolve the </p><p>problem. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
