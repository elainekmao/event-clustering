FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EAP/BCLTV (JESS), DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KIRF, PHUM, PREL, VM, PHUM, PREL, VM, VT, VTKIRF, religious freedom </p><p>SUBJECT: STRENGTHENING CATHOLICISM IN VIETNAM ONE BISHOP AT </p><p>A TIME </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON, REASON EO 12958 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C)  SUMMARY:  ALTHOUGH THE COLD WAR IS OVER FOR MOST, </p><p>THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNIST REGIMES </p><p>IN ASIA.  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS AFFAIRS </p><p>WITHOUT INTERFERENCE IS CURRENTLY BETTER IN </p><p>VIETNAM THAN IN CHINA, BUT THE HOLY SEE IS WORKING IN VIETNAM </p><p>TO ADVANCE ITS FREEDOM TO OPERATE ONE STEP AT A TIME. </p><p>ACCORDING TO HOLY SEE EAST ASIA AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONSIGNOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05803  01 OF 02  030646Z </p><p>LUIS MONTEMAYOR, THE HOLY SEE IS BATTING ABOUT .500 DURING </p><p>ITS ANNUAL MEETINGS WITH THE GOV ON CHURCH ISSUES IN VIETNAM. </p><p> HOLY SEE DFM MIGLIORE IN AN OCTOBER 10-16 VISIT TO VIETNAM </p><p>REACHED AGREEMENT ON APPOINTMENT OF SOME BISHOPS AND </p><p>APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATORS, BUT FAILED IN OTHERS.  THE KEY </p><p>ISSUE OF WHO WILL REPLACE CARDINAL PHAM DIHN TUNG REMAINS TO </p><p>BE RESOLVED.  OTHER ISSUES CURRENTLY OF CONCERN TO THE HOLY </p><p>SEE ARE THE OPPRESSION OF THE MONTAGNARDS AND THE </p><p>IMPRISONMENT OF OUTSPOKEN POLITICAL ACTIVIST FATHER VAN LEE </p><p>-- WHOM THE HOLY SEE VIEWS AS A VICTIM OF POLITICAL, NOT </p><p>RELIGIOUS, OPPRESSION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>PLAYING FOR THE LONG-TERM </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  AS BEFITS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF AN ENTITY WITH OVER </p><p>2000 YEARS OF HISTORY BEHIND IT, HOLY SEE S/E ASIA COUNTRY </p><p>DIRECTOR MSGR. LUIS MONTEMAYOR WAS CONFIDENT THAT EVENTUALLY </p><p>THE HOLY SEE WOULD SUCCEED IN PRYING OPEN THE DOORS TO FULL </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN VIETNAM.  "WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME", HE </p><p>NOTED.  THE HOLY SEE UNDERSTANDS THAT PROGRESS COMES SLOWLY </p><p>WHEN DEALING WITH A COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT.  CONSEQUENTLY, IT </p><p>ACCEPTS THAT, AS IT SEEKS TO SHUFFLE THE DECK ON </p><p>APPOINTMENTS, IT IS LIKELY TO RECEIVE APPROVAL FOR ONLY SOME </p><p>OF ITS REQUESTS OF THE GOV FOR FREEDOM TO ADMINISTER THE </p><p>CHURCH.  ACCORDING TO MONTEMAYOR, THE HOLY SEE IS SEEKING TO </p><p>MOVE CLERGY FROM THE MORE "COMPLIANT" 15 SOUTHERN DIOCESES </p><p>CLOSELY LINKED TO ROME TO LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE MORE </p><p>"ALIENATED" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05803  01 OF 02  030646Z </p><p>10 DIOCESES IN THE NORTH.  OVER THE LONG RUN THE HOLY SEE </p><p>HOPES TO ENSURE BROADER ACCEPTANCE OF ROME\'S CENTRAL ROLE IN </p><p>CHURCH AFFAIRS IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  A KEY BAROMETER OF GOV FLEXIBILITY IS ITS ACCEPTANCE </p><p>OF VATICAN APPOINTEES TO BISHOPS\' SEATS.  DURING THE OCTOBER </p><p>VISIT TO VIETNAM BY VATICAN DFM CELESTINO MIGLIORE, THE </p><p>VATICAN OBTAINED GOV AGREEMENT TO APPOINTING REV. JOSEPH VU </p><p>VAN THIEM AS THE NEW BISHOP IN HAI PHONG, A COADJUTOR BISHOP </p><p>IN CAN THO AND A SUCCESSOR TO THE BISHOP OF KONTUM.  THE GOV </p><p>REJECTED THE HOLY SEE\'S CANDIDATES FOR THE POST OF COADJUTOR </p><p>OF HANOI AND THE BISHOP TO HUNG HOA AS WELL AS THE REQUEST TO </p><p>DIVIDE THE PROVINCE OF XUAN LOC INTO TWO APOSTOLIC </p><p>TERRITORIES.  ALTHOUGH THE HOLY SEE AND GOV HAVE AGREED ON AN </p><p>APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE DIOCESE OF HANOI, THE ISSUE </p><p>OF NAMING A REPLACEMENT FOR 83-YEAR-OLD CARDINAL TUNG REMAINS </p><p>UNSETTLED (NOTE: TUNG IS CONTINUING IN HIS SEE BECAUSE THE </p><p>HOLY SEE DID NOT HAVE GOV SUPPORT FOR THE REPLACEMENT THEY </p><p>DESIRED).  ACCORDING TO MONTEMAYOR, CARDINAL TUNG AND THE </p><p>HOLY SEE REMAIN AT ODDS OVER HIS REPLACEMENT, AND THE HOLY </p><p>SEE BELIEVES THE GOV IS BLOCKING THEIR CANDIDATE PER TUNG,S </p><p>REQUEST.  THE GOV HAS ASKED FOR A LIST OF THREE CANDIDATES </p><p>FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE, BUT THE HOLY SEE WILL ONLY SUBMIT ITS </p><p>ONE CHOICE.  SHOULD CARDINAL TUNG DIE BEFORE AN AGREEMENT IS </p><p>REACHED, THE HOLY SEE WILL LEAVE THE SEAT VACANT AND LET THE </p><p>GOV EXPLAIN TO THE WORLD WHY IT IS BLOCKING THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>RIGHT TO CHOSE HIS SUCCESSOR. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\'S INABILITY TO CONTROL LOCAL PERSECUTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05803  01 OF 02  030646Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  MSGR. NGUYEN VAN PHUONG, WHO ACCOMPANIED DFM </p><p>MIGLIORE, TOLD US THAT THE GOV ACKNOWLEDGED RECEIVING WRITTEN </p><p>ACCOUNTS OF PERSECUTION OF CENTRAL HIGHLAND CATHOLICS FROM </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE BISHOPS\' CONFERENCE.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE </p><p>GOV WAS AWARE THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE HARASSING </p><p>CHRISTIANS, "THE RELIGION OF FOREIGNERS," AND FORCING THEM TO </p><p>SIGN STATEMENTS REJECTING CHRISTIANITY.  THE GOV HAD </p><p>APOLOGIZED FOR THIS BEHAVIOR AND PROMISED A RESPONSE.  TO </p><p>DATE, SOME 300-PLUS FAMILIES HAVE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF </p><p>THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>DISTINGUISHING RELIGIOUS FROM POLITICAL OPPRESSION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9027 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05803  02 OF 02  030646Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SS-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------11BE9A  030647Z /38 </p><p>P 030513Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BANGKOK PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY HANOI PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MANILA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY RANGOON PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 005803 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

(C)  THE HOLY SEE IS A STAUNCH PROPONENT OF RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM, AND SEEKS TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY, SAID FATHER </p><p>NGUYEN.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOLY SEE RECOGNIZED THAT THE RECENT </p><p>IMPRISONMENT OF A LOCAL CATHOLIC PRIEST IN VIETNAM WAS A </p><p>POLITICAL ACTION BASED ON HIS OUTSPOKEN POSITION ON GOV </p><p>POLICIES RATHER THAN A SUPPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  THE </p><p>IMPRISONED FATHER VAN LEE HAD SPOKEN AGAINST THE GOV POSITION </p><p>DURING A TRADE TREATY DISPUTE WITH THE U.S.  THE HOLY SEE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05803  02 OF 02  030646Z </p><p>WHILE HARDLY APPROVING OF THE PRIEST\'S IMPRISONMENT, WILL NOT </p><p>CONDEMN IT AS A SUPPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  THEY ARE </p><p>CAREFUL NOT TO PLAY THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CARD TOO OFTEN, IN </p><p>ORDER TO PRESERVE THEIR EQUITIES FOR TRULY EGREGIOUS </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  THE HOLY SEE REMAINS INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING </p><p>OFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH GOV.  CURRENTLY, THE LINES OF </p><p>COMMUNICATION ARE LIMITED TO THE ANNUAL HOLY SEE DELEGATION </p><p>VISIT AND THROUGH THE GOV EMBASSY TO ITALY.  WHILE THE HOLY </p><p>SEE GENERALLY PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON THE PROGRESS WITH THE </p><p>GOV THIS YEAR, MIGLIORE HAD COMPLAINED BEFORE HIS TRIP THAT </p><p>THEY WERE "TIRED" OF THE 50 PERCENT APPROACH BY THE GOV.  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE APPRECIATES THE DEPARTMENT\'S FREEDOM OF RELIGION </p><p>REPORT, WHICH THEY BELIEVE STRENGTHENS THEIR ABILITY TO </p><p>CONTINUE PRESSING THE GOV FOR GREATER RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05803 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
