(C) IN A MEETING WITH THE MFA\'S ACTING OFFICE DIRECTOR </p><p>FOR UN AFFAIRS, MARIO BALDI, POLOFF CONVEYED MESSAGES ON U.S. </p><p>GOALS FOR THE 57TH UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY (UNGA) (REF D) AND ON </p><p>THE CANDIDACY OF RUTH WEDGWOOD FOR THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>COMMITTEE (REF A).  BALDI STATED THAT THE GOI SHARED USG </p><p>GOALS FOR THE SESSION, EXCEPT THAT ON THE MIDDLE EAST WE HAD </p><p>DIVERGENT MEANS FOR ACCOMPLISHING THOSE GOALS.  THE GOI </p><p>ADVOCATES AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TO END THE CONFLICT IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST, USING AFGHANISTAN AS A MODEL.  HE EXPLAINED </p><p>THE DILEMMA THE GOI FACED AS A RESULT OF THE U.S. POSITION ON </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AND ARTICLE 98 BUT PROMISED </p><p>THAT ITALY WOULD ADVOCATE FLEXIBILITY AS THE EU DEVELOPS A </p><p>COMMON POSITION.  THE GOI REQUESTED USG SUPPORT FOR ITS </p><p>FUTURE BIDS FOR THE UN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (UNCHR) AND </p><p>THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL.  ITALY WANTS TO INCREASE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS PROTECTION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE WORLD </p><p>AS A MEANS OF FIGHTING TERRORISM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>"JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT" </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) POLOFF MET WITH MARIO BALDI, MFA ACTING OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR FOR UN AFFAIRS, ON AUGUST 7 TO TRANSMIT MESSAGES ON </p><p>U.S. GOALS FOR THE 57TH UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY (REF D) AND THE </p><p>CANDIDACY OF RUTH WEDGWOOD FOR THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE </p><p>(REF A).  BALDI GLANCED AT THE UNGA TALKING POINTS, SAID THAT </p><p>THE GOI SHARED OUR GOALS, SMILED, AND SAID, "NOW WHEN ARE YOU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03934  01 OF 02  091331Z </p><p>GOING TO SIGN THE ROME ACCORD (FOUNDING STATUTE OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT)?"  HE CITED THREE RECENT </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS BETWEEN GOI AND USG OFFICIALS ON THE </p><p>SUBJECT (REFS B AND C), THE PLAN TO DEVELOP A COMMON EU </p><p>POSITION ON ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS IN SEPTEMBER, AND -- AS THE </p><p>BIRTHPLACE OF ITS FOUNDING STATUTE -- ITALY\'S SPECIAL </p><p>COMMITMENT TO THE ICC.  ITALY WAS IN THE DIFFICULT POSITION </p><p>OF TRYING BOTH TO ACCOMMODATE THE U.S. REQUEST FOR AN ARTICLE </p><p>98 AGREEMENT AND TO PURSUE ITS OWN INTERESTS.  HE ASKED FOR </p><p>CONFIRMATION, WHICH POLOFF PROVIDED, THAT ONLY ROMANIA AND </p><p>ISRAEL HAVE YET CONCLUDED SUCH AGREEMENTS.  HE PROMISED THAT </p><p>ITALY WOULD WORK FOR A PRAGMATIC SOLUTION IN BRUSSELS BUT </p><p>SAID IT WAS "VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE UNITED STATES NOT IMPEDE </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES FROM RATIFYING." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  IN AN AUGUST 1 CONVERSATION, A/POLCOUNS HAD </p><p>ASSURED BALDI THAT WE SOUGHT ONLY TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS </p><p>WITHIN THE PARAMETERS ALLOWED BY THE ROME TREATY AND NOT TO </p><p>CONVINCE OTHERS NOT TO SIGN.  WHILE BALDI\'S COMMENTS </p><p>REGARDING THE ICC REFLECT THE GOI\'S INSTITUTIONAL REACTION, </p><p>IT IS LIKELY THAT HE IS NOT FULLY INFORMED ABOUT EMBASSY </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS AT THE MFA AND PM\'S </p><p>OFFICE.  THE FINAL DECISION AS TO ITALY\'S SIGNING OF AN </p><p>ARTICLE 98 ACCORD WILL BE MADE AT THE HIGHEST POLITICAL </p><p>LEVELS OF THE GOI.  IT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT DISCUSSION IS </p><p>TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT THE BUREAUCRACY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>SAME GOALS; DIFFERENT MEANS ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03934  01 OF 02  091331Z </p><p>4.  (C) "WE SHARE THE SAME GOALS BUT DON\'T ALWAYS AGREE ON </p><p>MEANS," BALDI SAID, CITING ISRAEL/PALESTINE AND IRAQ AS </p><p>EXAMPLES.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE LATEST UNGA RESOLUTION ON THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST WAS BALANCED, BECAUSE IT DEPLORED BOTH SIDES\' </p><p>FAILINGS.  WHEN QUESTIONED ON THIS POINT, HE ASSERTED THAT </p><p>THE RESOLUTION CRITICIZED THE "PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\'S USE OF </p><p>CIVILIANS AS HUMAN SHIELDS" AS WELL AS "ISRAEL\'S EXCESSIVE </p><p>USE OF FORCE" (SIC).  ON IRAQ, HE ASKED WHAT THE LEGAL </p><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR USE OF FORCE WOULD BE AND OPINED THAT A UN </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION WOULD BE UNOBTAINABLE.  TOLD THAT </p><p>NO PLANS HAVE BEEN MADE AND THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD CONSULT </p><p>WITH ALLIES LIKE ITALY IN THE EVENT OF ANY BEING MADE, HE </p><p>REPLIED, "WE HOPE SO." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) DRAWING ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONFERENCE THAT CREATED THE INTERIM GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, BALDI SUGGESTED A "BONN CONFERENCE" ON THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST THAT WOULD INCLUDE EVERYONE WITH A ROLE TO PLAY </p><p>IN RESOLVING THE CONFLICT.  THIS CONFERENCE WOULD COVER </p><p>SECURITY, JUSTICE, LAND, AND DEVELOPMENT.  IT WOULD EMPHASIZE </p><p>THAT THERE IS NO CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS (I.E., BETWEEN THE </p><p>MUSLIM WORLD AND THE WEST) BUT ONLY A CLSH BETWEEN THOSE WHO </p><p>WANT PEACE AND THOSE WHO WAT ONLY DESTRUCTION.

(NOTE:  THE GOI HAS MADE CLEAR </p><p>ELSEWHERE THAT IT WOULD BE WILLING, EVEN EXPECTS, TO HOST A </p><p>MIDDLE EAST PEACE CONFERENCE.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>"WE GAVE YOU THE UNCHR SEAT, NOW IT\'S YOUR TURN" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03934  02 OF 02  091332Z </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) BALDI REMINDED POLOFF THAT (ALONG WITH SPAIN) THE </p><p>GOI\'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW ITS CANDIDACY FOR THE UNCHR </p><p>PROVIDED A CLEAN SLATE FOR THE U.S. CANDIDACY.  THE GOI WANTS </p><p>A SEAT IN 2004-06 AND "EXPECTS" OUR SUPPORT.  ITALY WILL ALSO </p><p>RUN IN 2006 FOR THE 2007-08 PERIOD FOR THE UNSC NON-PERMANENT </p><p>SEAT THAT IT FAILED TO WIN IN 2000 AND WOULD LIKE OUR SUPPORT </p><p>ON THIS, AS WELL.  BY BEGINNING ITS CAMPAIGN EARLY, THE GOI </p><p>EXPECTS TO WIN THE UNSC SEAT.  ITS GOALS WOULD BE UNSC REFORM </p><p>AND BETTER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE UN AND EU ON POLITICAL AND </p><p>MILITARY LEVELS.  (NOTE:  ITALY\'S PROPOSAL FOR UNSC REFORM IS </p><p>TO ADD EIGHT-TEN REGIONAL, NON-PERMANENT SEATS THAT WOULD BE </p><p>SHARED AMONG COUNTRIES -- ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT CONTRIBUTE </p><p>THE MOST TO UN ACTIVITIES </p><p>+ </p><p>]3JQ/@ </p><p>C&{YKQ </p><p>I_:THE </p><p>UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>GOI PRIORITIES:  DRAINING THE WATER TERRORISTS SWIM IN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ASKED WHAT THE GOI\'S PRIORITIES WERE FOR UNGA, BALDI </p><p>EXPRESSED ENTHUSIASM FOR AN ACTIVIST AGENDA.  USING AN </p><p>ITALIAN METAPHOR ABOUT CATCHING A FISH BY DRAINING THE WATER </p><p>IT SWIMS IN, BALDI SAID THAT THE GOI PRIORITIZED HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>PROTECTION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS TOOLS FOR REDUCING </p><p>TERRORISM.  "WE MUST FIGHT TERRORISM NOT ONLY THROUGH </p><p>REPRESSION BUT ALSO BY FIGHTING THE SENSE OF DESPERATION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03934  02 OF 02  091332Z </p><p>INDOCTRINATION BY TERRORIST GROUPS SUCCEEDS IN AN ATMOSPHERE </p><p>OF POVERTY, IGNORANCE, AND LACK OF HOPE FOR A BETTER FUTURE." </p><p> BALDI CALLED FOR MILITARY ACTION, POLITICAL RECONCILIATION, </p><p>AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MEASURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED TOGETHER, </p><p>AS HAS BEEN DONE IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) POLOFF NOTED THAT THE GOI HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE </p><p>OF GLOBAL ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS.  BALDI MENTIONED THAT ITALY </p><p>HAS APPROVED TEN OF THE TWELVE INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>CONVENTIONS.  HE EXPECTED PARLIAMENT TO APPROVE THE FINAL TWO </p><p>SHORTLY AFTER REOPENING IN SEPTEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) LIKE THE UNITED STATES, ITALY WOULD EMPHASIZE </p><p>GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT, THE NEW ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, DEBT RELIEF, AND OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE </p><p>(ODA).  THE GOI AGREES WITH PRIORITIZING GOOD GOVERNANCE AND </p><p>EDUCATION IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  IT IS COMMITTED TO </p><p>INCREASING ITS ODA IN LINE WITH ITS EU OBLIGATIONS AND HAS </p><p>PLACED SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON E-GOVERNMENT-RELATED ASSISTANCE. </p><p>ITALY HAS HOSTED TWO CONFERENCES ON E-GOVERNMENT FOR THE </p><p>DEVELOPING WORLD, THE MOST RECENT IN PALERMO IN APRIL. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03934 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
