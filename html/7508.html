<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: ORAL MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY REGARDING </p><p>4/18 RIYADH MEETING ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 97844 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. R. Pearson.  Reason:1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador called on MFA Undersecretaries Baki Ilkin </p><p>and Ali Tuygan April 17 to deliver reftel message to the GOT </p><p>regarding the April 18 meeting on Iraq in Riyadh, noting our </p><p>concern that Syria may try to hijack the proceedings.  Tuygan </p><p>said Turkey would work for moderation.  They also discussed </p><p>Turkey\'s interest in helping with humanitarian assistance, in </p><p>reconstruction and the possibility it would want to </p><p>contribute to a stabilization force.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Riyadh Meeting </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Tuygan noted he will go to Riyadh with F.M. Gul, who </p><p>was invited by the Saudis; the Saudis explained that the </p><p>meeting would "take stock of events in Iraq and try to find </p><p>common ground" for the next stage in developments there. He </p><p>offered that most of the participants, including Syria and </p><p>Iran, will try using the meeting to send a strong message to </p><p>the U.S.  Other attendees will push for cooperation with the </p><p>USG while highlighting "local sensitivities, which are </p><p>exacting a high price,"  Tuygan said.  "We need to say </p><p>something to our publics," he added.  Both Tuygan and Ilkin </p><p>stated that Turkey will do what it can to promote moderation </p><p>at the meeting, noting that "this is not the time not to </p><p>cooperate" with the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Tuygan raised two points which, he said, are likely to </p><p>be on the agenda in Riyadh: (1) the Middle East peace </p><p>process, in which Turkey wants to play a constructive role; </p><p>and (2) Syria\'s draft UNSC resolution regarding a WMD-free </p><p>zone -- an idea Damascus pushed at the early March meeting of </p><p>regional FoMins in Istanbul.  On both these fronts, the </p><p>Saudis will be key to setting a moderate tone; "we\'ve seen </p><p>too many (regional) meetings," Tuygan said, "dominated by the </p><p>radicals."   He and Ilkin doubted whether a positive </p><p>post-meeting statement would be possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador reiterated that the USG is aware of the </p><p>possible Syrian approach in Riyadh, noting that, given </p><p>Syria\'s own WMD programs and refusal to sign various WMD </p><p>treaties, Damascus is not in a strong position to push its </p><p>draft resolution.  He also acknowledged that the Saudi role </p><p>at the meeting is key  -- and that the USG is not asking </p><p>Turkey to "shoulder any special burdens." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Other Issues </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador noted that the Turkish Red Crescent </p><p>(Kizilay) has publicly criticized the U.S. for a perceived </p><p>failure to facilitate its humanitarian mission in Iraq. </p><p>Ambassador noted that Kizilay\'s objectives in Iraq are </p><p>commendable, but its anxiety is misplaced.  Kizilay needs to </p><p>above all to coordinate its activities with the ICRC. </p><p>Moreover, the U.S. simply does not have the manpower to </p><p>supply security to Kizilay convoys.  Ambassador urged MFA to </p><p>encourage Kizilay to actively seek out ways to participate in </p><p>the ICRC framework.  Tuygan then noted Turkey\'s interest in </p><p>bringing injured civilians to Turkey for treatment in Turkish </p><p>hospitals, and asked whether it was possible for Turkey to </p><p>obtain permission from Kuwait for access to Kuwaiti airspace </p><p>and airports.  Ambassador commended the GOT for its interest, </p><p>noting the crush of identical requests from other countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador noted we had been told that Turkey was </p><p>preparing to offer resources for stabilization of Iraq. </p><p>Tuygan said that the GOT has reacted favorably to the idea, </p><p>though it has not discussed the issue in detail and the </p><p>modalities and other arrangements would need to be clarified </p><p>first.  Tuygan expressed concern lest any such force </p><p>apportion different segments of Iraq to different ethnic </p><p>groups, noting GOT is particularly disappointed at statements </p><p>by Barzani and Talabani, which imply to the Turks that the </p><p>Kurds are interested in asserting independent control over </p><p>the north.  He claimed that: (1) some 3,000 Kurdish families </p><p>have recently moved into Kirkuk; and (2) that the Peshmergas </p><p>are taking control of abandoned weapons, including tanks, and </p><p>have not in fact left the city. </p><p>7. (7) Ambassador noted these concerns.  He also stated that </p><p>information coming to the USG -- which has a wealth of </p><p>resources on the ground -- paints a completely different </p><p>picture of the situation: there is, in fact, no Kurdish </p><p>takeover of Kirkuk; the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline will </p><p>soon open under U.S. control.  The Ambassador emphasized that </p><p>the USG is operating in complete good faith in Iraq; that we </p><p>have read the riot act to Barzani and Talabani regarding the </p><p>need for them to do the same; and that something must be done </p><p>to bridge the knowledge gap between rumor in Turkey and what </p><p>we know as the actual state of things in the region.  Tuygan </p><p>took the point, expressing interest in greater U.S.-Turkey </p><p>intelligence coordination.  He noted that the GOT fully </p><p>accepts that the USG is showing good faith, but noted that </p><p>"there always will be an element of suspicion" regarding the </p><p>activities of the Iraqi Kurds; Tuygan said that the GOT was </p><p>pleased with the outcome of the recent meeting between Iraqi </p><p>Turkoman representatives and General Osman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Tuygan and Ilkin expressed interest in participating </p><p>in reconstruction efforts, and to be kept informed as to </p><p>developments along these lines. Ambassador replied that we </p><p>will encourage Gen. Garner to meet with the Turkish </p><p>Ambassador in Kuwait.  He noted that the Embassy in Ankara </p><p>routinely supplies information about opportunities there to </p><p>Turkish companies, who are free to place bids with prime </p><p>contractors. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
