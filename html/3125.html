<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 002862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CY, GR, IT, TU, EU, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI TO NAME SPECIAL COORDINATOR FOR CYPRUS; WILL </p><p>PUSH TIMETABLE FOR TURKEY\'S EU ENTRY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON: 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ON JUNE 10, THE ITALIAN MFA\'S DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS, MAURIZIO MORENO, AND DIRECTOR </p><p>FOR SOUTHERN EUROPE, GIOVANNI RICCIULI, TOLD SPECIAL CYPRUS </p><p>COORDINATOR TOM WESTON THAT ITALY WOULD APPOINT ITS OWN </p><p>SPECIAL ENVOY FOR CYPRUS, SOMEONE OF APPROPRIATE RANK AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02862  121804Z </p><p>EXPERIENCE WHO CAN FOCUS ON THE ISSUES, WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR </p><p>WEEKS.  MORENO ALSO SAID THAT WHILE THE GOI WOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>KEEP PRESSURE ON TURKEY REGARDING CYPRUS, IT WOULD ALSO LOBBY </p><p>THE EU TO ESTABLISH A TIMETABLE FOR TURKEY\'S ACCESSION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  AMB. WESTON OPENED THE MEETING BY SUMMARIZING FOR </p><p>MORENO THE STATUS OF CYPRUS NEGOTIATIONS TO DATE, AND NOTED </p><p>THAT THERE WAS NOW A "WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY" FOR PROGRESS, </p><p>GIVEN THE DYNAMIC POLITICAL SITUATION IN ANKARA.  WESTON </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT HIS VISIT WAS TIMED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS </p><p>SITUATION, AND THAT HIS UPCOMING TALKS IN ANKARA, ATHENS, AND </p><p>NICOSIA WOULD BE DESIGNED TO PUSH HARD FOR PROGRESS ON ALL </p><p>SIDES, OR AT A MINIMUM, HALT ANY BACKSLIDING.  IF THERE WERE </p><p>NO AGREEMENT BY JUNE, CONTINUED WESTON, THE TALKS WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE AFTER A SHORT BREAK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  MORENO THANKED WESTON FOR THE SUMMARY, AND NOTED </p><p>THAT HIS VISIT TO THE REGION CAME AT A CRITICAL TIME.  CYPRUS </p><p>IS AN ISSUE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE GOI, AND ITALY WAS READY </p><p>TO DO WHAT IT COULD TO "SPEED UP" THE PROCESS IN CYPRUS. </p><p>PROGRESS WILL BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERING THAT IT IS </p><p>VERY LIKELY THAT CYPRUS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE NEXT ROUND OF </p><p>EU ENLARGEMENT, CONTINUED MORENO, AND IT IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT </p><p>THE GOI WANTS ON THE AGENDA WHEN THE IT ASSUMES THE EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2003.   ACCORDINGLY, THE GOI </p><p>IS CONSIDERING TAKING SOME CONCRETE STEPS TO MOVE THE </p><p>PROCESS, INCLUDING NAMING A HIGH-LEVEL ENVOY TO FOCUS SOLELY </p><p>ON CYPRUS WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS, A VISIT SOON TO THE </p><p>THREE CAPITALS BY UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE ROBERTO ANTONIONE, </p><p>AND A VISIT TO ANKARA BY PM BERLUSCONI IN JULY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02862  121804Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  MORENO SAID THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO "KEEP THE PRESSURE ON" TURKEY; THE </p><p>GOI WOULD USE THE PROPOSED VISITS AND ENVO TO DO JUST THAT. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE PROGRESS </p><p>THUS FAR BY TURKEY.  INANCIAL AID MAY NOT BE ENOUGH, SAID </p><p>MORENO, ANDTHEREFORE THE GOI WOULD LIKE THE EU TO APPROVE </p><p>A TIMETABLE FOR </p><p>TURKISH ACCESSION.  MORENO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS </p><p>WOULD NOT BE A POPULAR INITIATIVE AMON MANY EU MEMBERS. </p><p>NONETHELESS, HE SAID, ITALY BEIEVES THIS CONCESSION TO </p><p>TURKEY MAY BE NECESSARYTO KEEP THE CYPRUS TALKS ON TRACK. </p><p> </p><p>5.
