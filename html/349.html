<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L FREETOWN 00872 </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, SOVIET UNION, PINR, SL </p><p>SUBJECT:  SPYING CHARGES AGAINST USSR </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A)  FBIS 011418Z FEB 90, B)  MONROVIA 1175, </p><p> C)  FREETOWN 0443,       D)  STATE 048127 </p><p> </p><p>1.  REFTELS REFER TO SOVIET DENIALS OF ALLEGED U.S. </p><p>CHARGES OF THEIR SPYING ON U.S. INSTALLATIONS FROM </p><p>FACILITIES IN SIERRA LEONE. FOLLOWING CONFIRMATION </p><p>THAT IN FACT WE NEVER MADE SUCH ALLEGATIONS, DCM </p><p>TRIED TO CALL HIS COUNTERPART AT SOVIET EMBASSY. </p><p>THE COUNTERPART NEVER RETURNED PHONE CALLS AND WE </p><p>DECIDED TO PUT OUR EFFORTS ON HOLD UNTIL AN OPPOR- </p><p>TUNITY PRESENTED ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THAT OPPORTUNITY CAME ON MONDAY 2/27, WHEN DCM </p><p>MET NEW SOVIET POLITICAL OFFICER AT INAUGURATION </p><p>OF A TRAINING COURSE FOR NEW WEST AFRICAN DIPLOMATS. </p><p>DCM TOOK THE OCCASION TO EXPLAIN OUR PUZZLEMENT WITH </p><p>THE REPORTS.  THE NEXT MORNING DCM RECEIVED A CALL </p><p>FROM SOVIET DCM WHO INVITED HIM TO SOVIET EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AT 2/28 MEETING WITH SOVIET DCM GENADI RAISKI </p><p>AND AMBASSADOR\'S SECRETARY/TRANSLATOR KONSTANTINE </p><p>ALERSEYEV.  DCM AGAIN EXPLAINED OUR PUZZELMENT AND </p><p>ASSURED SOVIETS WE HAD SENT NO NOTE OR MESSAGE TO </p><p>GOSL COMPLAINING OF SOVIET ACTIVITIES.  RAISKI </p><p>REPLIED THAT HIS EMBASSY WAS JUST AS PUZZLED BY THE </p><p>AFFAIR, INDICATING THEY HAD ALSO HEARD OF THE DENIAL </p><p>FROM TASS THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY IN MOSCOW. </p><p>THEY HAD HEARD OF NO REPORTS HERE. </p><p>4.  RAISKI ASKED IF THE EMBASSY MIGHT NOT KNOW OF </p><p>THE ACTIVITIES OF OTHER  USG AGENCIES </p><p>DCM REPLIED WE HAD CANVASSED A MULTITUDE OF OTHER </p><p>AGENCIES AND COULD FIND NO POSSIBLE SOURCE OF THE </p><p>ALLEGED ACCUSATION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  RAISKI EXPRESSED RELIEF AT OUR INFORMATION AND </p><p>INDICATED HIS DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP BETTER </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO EMBASSIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  TURNING TO OTHER MATTERS, RAISKI EXPRESSED HIS </p><p>CONCERN OVER THE SERIOUS OF THE SITUATION IN THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION AND WONDERED ALOUD IF IT MIGHT HAVE </p><p>BEEN BETTER HAD THEY FIRST TRIED TO INTIATE ECONO- </p><p>MIC BEFORE POLITICAL REFORM.  HE DEFENDED SOVIET </p><p>ACTIONS IN AZERBAIJAN AND ARMENIA POINTING OUT THAT </p><p>ALL THE GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO DO WAS STABILIZE </p><p>THE SITUATION AND STOP THE VIOLENCE.  HE SAID THE </p><p>ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN THE COUNTRY WERE VERY GREAT </p><p>AND IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO RESOLVE.  HE WAS </p><p>CLEARLY PESSIMISTIC ON THE SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  TURNING TO THE SIERRA LEONE SCENE, RAISKI EX- </p><p>PRESSED PESSISM ON THE SITUATION ASKING THE DCM </p><p>HIS VIEWS ON DEVALUATION, THE DEFICIT, AND THE IMF. </p><p>INTERESTINGLY RAISKI DID NOT BELIEVE DEVALUATION </p><p>WOULD WORK.  HE ADVOCATED A FLOATING EXCHANGE </p><p>RATE THAT WOULD HELP RECHANNEL EXPORT REVENUES TO </p><p>MORE PRODUCTIVE USES AND WOULD ALLOW FOR A MEETING </p><p>OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE.  THE </p><p>DCM\'S OBSERVATION THAT HE SOUNDED LIKE A FIRE MAR- </p><p>TIAL ECONOMIST BROUGHT AN APPRECIATIVE LAUGH. </p><p>- </p><p>RAISKI ALSO DISCUSSED SOVIET ATTEMPTS TO NEGOTIATE </p><p>A NEW FISHING AGREEMENT WITH THE GOSL.  HE WAS NOT </p><p>OPTIMISTIC.  (SEPTEL) </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  THE ENTIRE SPY CHARGE EPISODE SEEMS </p><p>VERY CONFUSED.  IT WOULD APPEAR HOWEVER, TO HAVE </p><p>ORIGINS OUTSIDE OF SIERRA LEONE.  WE HAVE REPORTED </p><p>ON RAISKI BEFORE.  HE APPEARS GENUINELY INTERESTED </p><p>IN BETTER RELATIONS, BUT LIKE MANY OF HIS COLLEGUES </p><p>UNSURE OF HOW TO PROCEED AND CONCURED ABOUT OUR RECEP- </p><p>TION TO FRIENDLY MOVES ON HIS PART.  PERHAPS WE </p><p>REASSURED HIM. </p><p> </p><p>YOUNG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
