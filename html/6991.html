<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001928 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: WEEKEND DEMONSTRATIONS MOSTLY PEACEFUL; </p><p>JORDANIANS OUTSIDE AMMAN UNITED AGAINST THE WAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 1867 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 1872 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 1875 </p><p>     D. AMMAN 1883 </p><p>     E. AMMAN 1905 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5(B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Jordanians express their anti war rage </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Weekend demonstrations in Jordan\'s refugee camps, </p><p>Amman, Irbid, Salt, Zarqa, Karak, Aqaba and Maan attracted </p><p>large numbers of anti war Jordanians.  Many demonstrators </p><p>carried pictures of Saddam Hussein, a phenomenon that has </p><p>been much less common in marches up to now, and chant "death </p><p>to America," hailing the Iraqi leader and the people of Iraq </p><p>for fighting the "US aggression".  While most demonstrations </p><p>were peaceful, the press reports that police in Maan, a city </p><p>with a history of confrontations, used tear gas when </p><p>protesters hurled stones at them.  In Amman, some protesters </p><p>called on Saddam to use chemical weapons against British and </p><p>US troops. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In downtown Amman, approximately 3,000 demonstrators </p><p>marched following noon prayers on March 28, a lower turnout </p><p>than a week ago.  Though largely peaceful, reports of </p><p>vandalism to a bus and some arrests took place.  Maan </p><p>reported another 400-500 rock throwing protesters.  On March </p><p>29, Public Security Directorate (PSD) sources reported that </p><p>approximately 7-10,000 anti-war protesters participated in </p><p>demonstrations in Irbid, with another 10,000 participants </p><p>near Marka airport in Amman and smaller peaceful </p><p>demonstrations in Wihdat and Baq\'aa refugee camps.  On March </p><p>31, smaller, non-violent candlelight vigils were reported, a </p><p>hundred press members marched peacefully and about 700 </p><p>participants demonstrated at the Professional Associations </p><p>Complex, never leaving the complex grounds.  More licensed </p><p>demonstrations are planned throughout the week. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Reactions to war outside Amman </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A survey of Embassy contacts outside Amman reflects </p><p>the population\'s growing loss of trust in their government </p><p>and its declarations.  In Salt, (a medium sized city 30 </p><p>minutes from Amman) former parliamentarian Salameh Hiyari </p><p>says the whole country is boiling and Jordanians are angry at </p><p>their government.  He worries the situation may get worse. </p><p>Many of our contacts throughout the country worry about the </p><p>huge disconnect they see between the King\'s public and </p><p>private position on the war, and the intense opposition to </p><p>the war of most Jordanians.  This gap, they argue, affects </p><p>the King and government\'s credibility with the populace. </p><p>Hiyari cites the ever growing number of Jordanians attending </p><p>Friday prayers and praying for God to support Iraq and </p><p>destroy the US. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In Ramtha, the home of the four Jordanian students </p><p>killed in Iraq last week, former parliamentarian Fawwaz Zu\'bi </p><p>says the mood is just as tense and calls the situation </p><p>"dangerous".  He says the people are very angry and wonders </p><p>how far that anger will go once the battle for Baghdad takes </p><p>place and greater numbers of Iraqi civilian deaths are shown </p><p>on Arab television. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Mohammad Al-Kouz, former parliamentarian who </p><p>represented the Wihdat refugee camp, says there is "complete </p><p>solidarity" with Saddam and the Iraqi people.  The </p><p>demonstrators at a rally in Wihdat Camp on March 28 numbered </p><p>in the low thousands.  He said the sole beneficiary of the </p><p>current situation is the Muslim Brotherhood. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Numerous contacts have expressed to us their worry </p><p>that the war in Iraq is making many Jordanians turn to </p><p>religion.  Our Western-oriented contacts in particular fear </p><p>that the war will boost the political fortunes of the Islamic </p><p>Action Front and other, more radical, groups. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
