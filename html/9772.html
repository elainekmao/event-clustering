STATE 219519 </p><p>     G. G. NEW DELHI 4101 (NOTAL) </p><p>     H. H. NEW DELHI 219512 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) In a series of meetings with Government of Nepal </p><p>(GoN) negotiators and security officials on July 30, the </p><p>Ambassador discussed development in the GoN\'s exchanges with </p><p>the Maoist leadership over the previous twenty-four hours. </p><p>The GoN formally responded to the Maoists\' recent demands on </p><p>July 29, offering concessions in a number of areas but </p><p>distancing itself from controversial decisions reportedly </p><p>made during the first two rounds of peace talks.  The </p><p>spokesman for the government negotiating team feels that the </p><p>GoN has done all it can and the ball is firmly in the </p><p>Maoists\' court.  The Nepal police believe that the Maoist </p><p>leadership is unsure how to address the GoN\'s response.  The </p><p>police also have reports that top Maoist leaders are meeting </p><p>in Delhi to consider their next move and are working to </p><p>solicit support from the European Commission and the Indian </p><p>government.  The police chief does not predict that the </p><p>Maoists pose a heightened risk to Americans in Nepal, but </p><p>will likely continue with their rhetoric.  The GoN requests </p><p>strong U.S. Government support should the cease-fire break. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Leadership Undecided on Conflict? </p><p>========================================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador met with Inspector General of Police </p><p>(IGP) Shayam Bakta Thapa to discuss developments during the </p><p>last twenty-four hours.  The IGP reported that the Government </p><p>of Nepal\'s (GoN) July 29 letter has thrown the Maoist </p><p>leadership, presently meeting in Delhi, into a dilemma on how </p><p>to proceed.  He believes that the Maoists did not expect the </p><p>government to provide any concessions or take their demands </p><p>seriously.  IGP Thapa also reported that the Maoists in New </p><p>Delhi were preparing letters to Ambassador Caillouet, Head of </p><p>the European Delegation in New Delhi, and to the Government </p><p>of India to appeal for their assistance.  IGP Thapa </p><p>complained about the continuing lack of Indian assistance to </p><p>rein in the Maoists.  He recalled events of several years ago </p><p>when a joint operation by the Royal Nepalese Army and Indian </p><p>police to arrest Maoist leaders meeting in Gorakhpur, India </p><p>was called off with a phone call from Delhi. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) According to the IGP, the Nepalese police learned </p><p>that during the cease-fire the Maoists collected limited </p><p>amounts of explosives, weapons, and ammunition but that the </p><p>Maoist leadership and affiliated organizations do not want to </p><p>return to armed struggle.  That said, both IGP Thapa and the </p><p>Ambassador assessed that the Maoists have bellies of cadre to </p><p>be both fed and politically fired and that the group cannot </p><p>sit idle for fear of losing their standing force through </p><p>desertion. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) When the Ambassador asked for the IGP\'s overall </p><p>assessment of the situation, he replied that, "yesterday, I </p><p>thought the cease-fire would break; today, I am more </p><p>hopeful."  He continued to say that if it did break, more of </p><p>the fighting would take place in urban areas, i.e., Kathmandu </p><p>Valley.  He bemoaned the return to combat that has already </p><p>seen the deaths of 996 Nepalese police officers.  IGP Thapa </p><p>also assessed that the Maoists would not likely target </p><p>Americans, but would continue verbal threats. </p><p> </p><p>Ball in Maoists\' Court </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Minister for Information and Communications and GoN </p><p>negotiation team spokesperson Kamal Thapa phoned the </p><p>Ambassador to update him on the government\'s reply to the </p><p>Maoists.  Late July 29, the GoN sent a response to the </p><p>Maoists\' July 28 letter addressing each of their five </p><p>ultimata and the July 31 deadline.  Thapa reported that in </p><p>recognition of the gravity of the situation, the government </p><p>had no choice but to send a prompt reply.  (Demands made by </p><p>the Maoists were reported ref A.) </p><p>-- Demand 1, Execution of Previous Agreements:  On July 29, </p><p>the GoN released three Maoist central committee members (ref </p><p>B) and one recently arrested Maoist extortionist; made public </p><p>the whereabouts of 36 Maoists (15 of whom were killed prior </p><p>to the cease-fire); and committed to publishing the </p><p>government\'s information on all 322 persons listed as missing </p><p>by the Maoists.  The GoN reportedly had committed to these </p><p>steps in previous rounds of negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>-- Demand 2, Role of the King in the Peace Talks:  The GoN </p><p>response to the Maoist demand reiterated King Gyanendra\'s </p><p>June 5 announcement that he was conferring executive power on </p><p>the Prime Minister and Cabinet (ref C).  (Note:  The GoN </p><p>response carefully avoided a commitment to involve the King </p><p>directly in future rounds of peace talks.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Demand 3, Role of the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA):  The GoN </p><p>affirmed that the RNA is a constitutional body, will follow </p><p>the government\'s orders, and faithfully implement decision </p><p>reached at the peace talks.  (Note:  The government did not </p><p>address the 5-kilometer restriction on military movements </p><p>reportedly agreed to during the second round of talks, ref D. </p><p> End note.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Demand 4, Abrogation of Antiterrorism Training Agreement </p><p>(ATA) and Termination of U.S. Security Assistance:  The GoN </p><p>responded that the ATA is an international agreement that </p><p>supports GoN policies in countering terrorism  (ref E).  The </p><p>GoN response went on to state that ATAs have been signed by a </p><p>number of countries, including India, in order to better </p><p>coordinate technical assistance.  Thapa reported that the </p><p>letter described exchanges between the U.S. and the RNA as </p><p>"normal and historical." </p><p> </p><p>-- Demand 5, Public Announcement of the GoN Political Agenda </p><p>for the Peace Talks:  The GoN\'s response stated simply that </p><p>the government\'s agenda would be tabled when talks resumed. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Thapa reported to the Ambassador that the government has </p><p>demonstrated maximum flexibility in its response to the </p><p>Maoists.  He stated further that the "ball is firmly in the </p><p>Maoists\' court;" the government can make no more concessions. </p><p> The GoN has not yet received a response from the Maoists. </p><p>Thapa is hopeful that growing public pressure will force the </p><p>Maoists to reply.  Thapa does not expect an immediate return </p><p>to hostilities; however, he believes that the Maoists will </p><p>attempt to play the government for additional time and </p><p>concessions. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Ambassador advised Thapa of the talking points Post </p><p>will deliver to Maoist representatives today (ref F; details </p><p>on the delivery will be provided septel).  The Ambassador and </p><p>Thapa committed to remain in touch. </p><p> </p><p>The Government Asks for Strong USG Support </p><p>=========================================== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In a meeting with the USAID Country Director and the </p><p>Ambassador, Minister of Finance and government negotiation </p><p>team head Prakash Lohani described the state of the </p><p>negotiations.  He judges that former minister and negotiator </p><p>Narayan Singh Pun had made serious missteps by allowing the </p><p>Maoists to engage in broad negotiations and agreeing to </p><p>consider the country as divided into two parts, the Maoists </p><p>in the rural areas and the GoN in the cities.  Lohani also </p><p>believes that Pun gave the Maoist negotiators an unrealistic </p><p>vision of the peace process, which has now become the primary </p><p>obstacle to further peace talks.  Informal discussions by </p><p>Ministers Thapa and Lohani with Maoist negotiators Krishna </p><p>Bahadur Mahara and Ram Bahadur Thapa (a.k.a., Badal) have </p><p>been reasonable; however, Lohani believes they represent the </p><p>minority view among the Maoist leadership.  Lohani also </p><p>reported that the Maoists appeared to believe that the King </p><p>was in agreement on the 5-kilometer restriction on the RNA. </p><p>Lohani stated that not only was the King unaware of the </p><p>demand, but the issue was not even discussed with the RNA. </p><p>9.  (C) Lohani reaffirmed that the GoN would continue efforts </p><p>to save the cease-fire and revive peace talks.  He noted, </p><p>however, that all of the concessions, from the code of </p><p>conduct to the two rounds of peace talks have been made by </p><p>the Government.  The GoN has even overlooked massive and </p><p>systematic Maoist violations of the code of conduct in order </p><p>to avoid disruption of the talks.  Lohani expressed the hope </p><p>that the GoN\'s July 29 response would strengthen moderate </p><p>Maoists to stand up to their more aggressive party cadres. </p><p>Should the Maoists renew violence, Lohani requests strong </p><p>support from the U.S. Government. </p><p> </p><p>Government Releases Maoists from Prison </p><p>======================================== </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) As reported in ref B, the GoN released central </p><p>committee members Mumaram Khanal, Rabindra Shrestha, and </p><p>Bamdev Chetri and student leader and extortionist Gyanendra </p><p>Tripathi (a.k.a. Sanjay Sharma).  Tripathi was arrested two </p><p>weeks ago with hundreds of thousands of rupees in cash from a </p><p>recent Maoist extortion drive.  In a public statement, </p><p>Minister for Information and Communication Thapa highlighted </p><p>that the government has released 1,513 Maoists from jail </p><p>since the beginning of the cease-fire. </p><p> </p><p>Post Comments </p><p>============== </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Government Response:  The Cabinet\'s response to the </p><p>Maoists\' demands reflects a much more organized and </p><p>nationalistic approach to the negotiations than exhibited by </p><p>the government\'s previous negotiators in the two rounds of </p><p>peace talks and in the code of conduct agreement.  This more </p><p>professional negotiating style may have altered Maoist </p><p>calculations on the degree to which they can achieve their </p><p>aims through negotiations.  Discussions with key personnel </p><p>today gave a slightly more optimistic assessment of the </p><p>situation than yesterday.  Despite the GoN\'s efforts over the </p><p>last twenty-four hours to accommodate the Maoists\' demands, </p><p>the government is taking steps to respond to a resumption of </p><p>violence. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S/NF) Maoist Safehavens in India:  Continued reports on </p><p>Maoist leadership meetings in India belie repeated assertions </p><p>by the Indian government that they are doing all they can </p><p>(ref G) to deny the Maoists the use of Indian territory. </p><p>Post welcomes the Department\'s instructions regarding an </p><p>urgent demarche to appropriate and effective levels of the </p><p>Government of India (ref H). </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
