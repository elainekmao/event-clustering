<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0072 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MARCH 12, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for March 12, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Milli Gazete: It is reported that the Kurdish </p><p>units stationed in Dohuk, close to the Turkish </p><p>border, returned to their bases on weekend to </p><p>confront Turkey\'s likely military incursion into </p><p>northern Iraq. Babaker Zebari, the commander of </p><p>Kurdish forces in the region, claimed they were </p><p>ready for any Turkish intervention. Zebari </p><p>claimed that "if Turks wanted problems, they </p><p>would be held responsible for them." The Kurdish </p><p>commander said that they would attack the Turkish </p><p>forces the moment they came, even though they had </p><p>only RPGs against the Turks\'tanks. He remarked </p><p>that they might not be able to hold the front but </p><p>would launch guerilla attacks. In his TV program </p><p>on Saturday, Mesut Barzani claimed that </p><p>penetration of Turkish troops into Northern Iraq </p><p>would create "serious consequences" and that he </p><p>hoped the US would not betray the Kurds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Milliyet: Based on its interviews with ordinary </p><p>Turkomen in Erbil, BBC claimed that the Turkomen, </p><p>as opposed to the Turkomen Front supported by </p><p>Ankara, were generally happy with their status </p><p>and did not need any protection from Turkey. The </p><p>BBC reporter said the number of Turkomen in </p><p>northern Iraq reached 2.5 million. Cevdet Naccar, </p><p>a Turkomen, said: "We enjoy the same rights as </p><p>the Kurds in Northern Iraq. There is no need for </p><p>the Turkish army to intervene on the pretext of </p><p>rescuing the Turkomen." An antique dealer named </p><p>Halis Yunus said: "They (the Turkish army) cannot </p><p>protect us against theft and looting anyway." A </p><p>Turkomen jeweler expressed the view that the </p><p>Kurds, Arabs, and Turkomen lived together and </p><p>could settle their problems among themselves. The </p><p>BBC reporter claimed that the only group that </p><p>actively supported Turkey\'s intervention was the </p><p>Turkomen Front, headed by Sanan Ahmet Aga, who </p><p>received his orders from Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Radikal/Turkiye: Families and NGO representatives </p><p>protested against statements made by northern </p><p>Iraqi Kurdish leaders Barzani and Talabani. 300 </p><p>people who gathered in front of the Martyrs </p><p>Monument in Diyarbakir yesterday morning shouted </p><p>anti-Barzani and anti-Talabani slogans and </p><p>dispersed peacefully after singing the Turkish </p><p>National Anthem and the delivering of the speech </p><p>by Ahmet Buyukburc, President of the Martyrs </p><p>Association\'s Diyarbakir Chapter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Milliyet/Sabah/Hurriyet: LA Times\' photographer </p><p>Donald Bartletti, ABC News cameraman Alan Weeks, </p><p>and Turkish producer Elif Ural tried to cross </p><p>into northern Iraq illegally.  They were arrested </p><p>by jandarmas who opened fire in the air. The </p><p>jandarmas on patrol had noticed the journalists </p><p>as they were wading across the Hezil River. The </p><p>journalists and the person who assisted them were </p><p>given a physical examination and interrogated at </p><p>Silopi Jandarma Command, and then were brought </p><p>before a court in the morning. The journalists </p><p>were given a fine of USD 54 for violating </p><p>immigration laws. As the journalists took a cab </p><p>to Onsar Hotel in Cizre, they were escorted by </p><p>police. It was decided that Bartletti and Weeks </p><p>would be deported from Turkey.  (Note: That is </p><p>correct.  End note.) </p><p>Radikal: There has been a boom in demand for </p><p>rental property, due to its proximity to the </p><p>Iraqi border. The rents for houses, shops, </p><p>storage facilities, and vacant land have </p><p>increased by 300 to 500 percent. Agit Ozdemir, a </p><p>pioneer who opened the first real estate office </p><p>in Silopi, said he rented out 19 houses in one </p><p>week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Milliyet/Radikal: War preparations in Mardin, </p><p>which is in the position of being the US </p><p>operation center, continues at full speed. The US </p><p>intensified work at a furniture factory rented in </p><p>the Organized Industrial Zone of Mardin. Mobile </p><p>toilets, bunk beds, mobile telephones, </p><p>foodstuffs, and all sorts of logistical material </p><p>are being stored in the furniture plant. </p><p>Meanwhile, Turkish armored units conducted </p><p>maneuvers in empty fields along the highway in </p><p>Kiziltepe. Appearance of the armored vehicles in </p><p>town created excitement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cumhuriyet/Bolge: Under the first modernization </p><p>of ports and airports motion submitted to the </p><p>Turkish National Grand Assembly, the US keeps </p><p>sending military equipment. The majority of the </p><p>shipments to the region come to Iskenderun port, </p><p>where 5000 US troops and 20-25 ships are reported </p><p>to be waiting off shore at Karpaz. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Radikal: Truck drivers who agreed with </p><p>contracting firms on transporting military </p><p>equipment from Iskenderun port to the Southeast </p><p>for USD 100 per day said they would stop carrying </p><p>the material because they had not been paid for </p><p>18 days. Thanks to the intervention of Turkish </p><p>military officials, the contracting firms gave an </p><p>advance to each trucker and transportation </p><p>resumed only thereafter. 89 TIR truck left </p><p>Iskenderun port while 15 TIR trucks loaded with </p><p>military equipment departed Incirlik AB for the </p><p>Southeast yesterday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dunya: Because of lack of storage room, some U.S. </p><p>military vehicles and materials were put in a </p><p>yarn factory outside the Mardin Organized </p><p>Industrial Zone. The Americans are trying to rent </p><p>500 shops in Evren Industrial Site in Sanliurfa </p><p>as well. Turkish-speaking US soldiers walking in </p><p>Diyarbakir\'s streets are meeting with the local </p><p>people and trying to obtain information about the </p><p>region. It is reported that Americans are looking </p><p>for a fully equipped hospital or medical center. </p><p>It is gathered that the US plans to fly wounded </p><p>soldiers to hospitals to be rented in Diyarbakir, </p><p>where they have already made offers to five big </p><p>private hospitals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sabah/Tercuman/Hurriyet: The Patriot missiles </p><p>deployed at the 8th Main Jet Base Command of the </p><p>2nd Tactical Command in Diyarbakir were shown to </p><p>the press. The Dutch commander of Patriot Air </p><p>Defense Systems Command, Lt. Col. Eric Harry </p><p>Abma, remarked that two of the three units of the </p><p>system were deployed in Diyarbakir, while the </p><p>other was deployed in Batman. He was quoted "We </p><p>are here to protect people of Diyarbakir and </p><p>Batman from Iraq. This is our military and </p><p>political mission." The systems were made </p><p>operational on March 11. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hurriyet: The US Consulate in Adana opened an </p><p>exhibition of photographs by famed American </p><p>photographer, William Albert Allard, at the </p><p>Seyhan Municipality Building. The exhibit - some </p><p>70 photographs reflecting American culture taken </p><p>by National Geographic Society veteran Allard -- </p><p>was opened by the American Consul, Adana Deputy </p><p>Governor Bulent Egriboz, and Seyhan Mayor </p><p>Yildiray Arikan.  Turkish and American invitees </p><p>attended the opening reception. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
