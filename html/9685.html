<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 001041 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, KOLY, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: OLYMPIC GAMES: ISTANBUL 2012? </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: On June 15, Istanbul formally submitted its </p><p>application to the International Olympic Committee to host </p><p>the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.  8 other cities had also </p><p>thrown their hats into the ring: London, Paris, New York, </p><p>Madrid, Moscow, Leipzig, Havana, and Rio de Janeiro.  Despite </p><p>the fierce competition and continuing friction with the </p><p>Istanbul municipality, Istanbul Olympic officials believe </p><p>that their 2012 bid (their fourth consecutive application) is </p><p>their strongest to date and that Istanbul has a good chance </p><p>to be chosen as one of the finalists. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ALWAYS A RUNNER-UP?  Despite having lost bids to host </p><p>the 2000, 2004, and 2008 games, Istanbul Olympic officials </p><p>are optimistic about their prospects for hosting the 2012 </p><p>Summer Olympic Games.  Like other would-be Olympic hosts, </p><p>Istanbul faced serious problems in its earlier bids regarding </p><p>the lack of sufficient venues and experience hosting </p><p>international competitions.  Although Istanbul was chosen as </p><p>a finalist in 2008, Istanbul Olympic officials believe that </p><p>political considerations made Beijing the odds-on favorite </p><p>(in addition to the fact that the 2004 games would be in </p><p>nearby Athens).  This time, however, Istanbul Olympic </p><p>officials are hopeful that their bid will be one of the </p><p>strongest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE MEETING OF CONTINENTS: Yalcin Aksoy, the General </p><p>Director of the Preparation and Organization Council for the </p><p>Istanbul Olympic Games, told us that Istanbul has two main </p><p>advantages in its favor.  First, Istanbul is not merely a </p><p>geographic link between Europe and Asia: historically, </p><p>culturally, and ethnically it brings much of the world </p><p>together.  The Council plays to this advantage with its </p><p>slogan, "Istanbul: The Meeting of Continents."  Aksoy also </p><p>noted that no Olympic games have ever been hosted by a </p><p>predominantly Muslim city. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE TURKISH OLYMPIC ACT: Next, Istanbul Olympic </p><p>officials have a unique legislative instrument, the Turkish </p><p>Olympic Act of May 1992, that guarantees the political </p><p>support and resources needed to prepare for the Olympic </p><p>Games.  Specifically, the Act (approved unanimously by the </p><p>Turkish Parliament) provided for the creation of a permanent </p><p>organization and staff to manage Istanbul\'s bids for the </p><p>games.  Additionally, the Act devotes specific sources of </p><p>revenue, including 5 percent of National Lottery proceeds and </p><p>one percent shares of the Sports Lottery, horse-race betting </p><p>ticket sales, and Istanbul Greater Municipality budget </p><p>(totaling about USD 15-20 million each year). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) WHITE ELEPHANTS?  As a result of this permanent staff </p><p>(which Aksoy claimed is unique among cities bidding to host </p><p>the Summer Games) and its financial resources, Istanbul has </p><p>been able to overcome some of the problems it had with its </p><p>early bids.  According to Aksoy, at the time of its first </p><p>Olympic bid, Istanbul had only one of the 33 sports </p><p>installations required to host the Summer Games.  Since then </p><p>the Council has spent almost USD 200 million on </p><p>installations, including an 80,000-seat Olympic stadium </p><p>(costing USD 120 million), an Olympic Natatorium, and a </p><p>20,000-seat gymnasium.  Plans are proceeding for an </p><p>exhibition center and an Olympic Village.  The Council has </p><p>also worked with local sports organizations to develop </p><p>experience in hosting international events, including recent </p><p>European diving and basketball championships.  Aksoy argued </p><p>that given Istanbul\'s size and the local demand for sport, </p><p>these venues will not be unused "white elephants."  Istanbul </p><p>will not build baseball stadiums or field hockey pitches </p><p>until it wins its bid for the games, Aksoy said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) TRANSPORTATION WOES AND THE CURSE OF OBSCURITY: </p><p>Istanbul\'s main disadvantage is its weak transportation </p><p>infrastructure and chronic traffic problems.  The city\'s </p><p>unsuccessful efforts to develop transportation networks to </p><p>service the rapidly growing population would be a major </p><p>problem in hosting an event as large as the Olympic Summer </p><p>Games.  Additionally, unlike London, Paris, and New York, </p><p>Istanbul is not as well known among the members of the </p><p>International Olympic Committee (IOC).  But new restrictions </p><p>imposed after the Salt Lake City scandals that prohibit IOC </p><p>members from visiting competing cities virtually guarantees </p><p>that most IOC members will have to vote on Istanbul\'s bid </p><p>without really knowing the city.  Aksoy worries that their </p><p>unfamiliarity and misguided impressions may imperil </p><p>Istanbul\'s Olympic aspirations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) FRICTION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNCIL: Another </p><p>disadvantage, largely downplayed by Aksoy, is the friction </p><p>between the Preparation and Organization Council and the </p><p>Istanbul Greater Municipality.  Although the Istanbul Mayor </p><p>is one of the 13 Board Members of the Council, the </p><p>legislative requirement that the city hand over one percent </p><p>of its budget to the Council has generated significant </p><p>tensions.  Much of the recent tension has focused on the </p><p>issue of transportation.  Aksoy admitted that the Olympic </p><p>Stadium\'s debut event last summer (a soccer match between </p><p>former UEFA and perennial Turkish Champions Galatasaray and </p><p>Greece\'s Olympiakos) was a "catastrophe" due to the lack of </p><p>sufficient roads (Note: Local newspapers and soccer fans </p><p>described the traffic into and out of the stadium as worse </p><p>than Dante\'s Inferno).  Due to the city\'s refusal to build </p><p>new roads and despite the fact that the Council\'s revenues </p><p>are not supposed to be used for transportation </p><p>infrastructure, the Council finally agreed last month to let </p><p>the city use a portion of its annual dues to finish the USD </p><p>10 million stadium access roads (just in time for Galatasaray </p><p>to use the stadium for the 2003-2004 season while their own </p><p>stadium is renovated). </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
