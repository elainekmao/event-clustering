<p>S E C R E T ROME 003169 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, IT, IZ, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI REP STILL ACCREDITED TO ROME </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 3050 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: EMIL M. SKODON  DCM  FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS A JOINT REPORT OF US MISSION TO FAO AND </p><p>EMBASSY ROME.  SEE ACTION REQUEST PARA 6. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  MUTASIM ARIF AL-FITYAN, LISTED IN THE UN FOOD AND </p><p>     AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) PERMANENT MISSION DIRECTORY </p><p>AS "ALTERNATE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE" (THE PERMANENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE POSITION IS HELD BY MUHAMMAD AL-SHEIKH), AND </p><p>IDENTIFIED BY ORCA AND SISMI (THE GOI EXTERNAL SERVICE) </p><p>AS THE IIS STATION CHIEF IN ROME, IS BELIEVED TO BE IN IRAQ. </p><p>HOWEVER, HIS FAMILY MEMBERS ARE STILL IN ROME AND SISMI </p><p>BELIEVES HE INTENDS TO RETURN TO ROME SOON. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FODAG AMBASSADOR HALL RAISED THE ISSUE OF EXPELLING </p><p>AL-FITYAN WITH FAO DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL DAVID HARCHARIK </p><p>IN EARLY MAY 2003. </p><p>FODAG ACTING DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION FOLLOWED UP WITH </p><p>MR. HARCHARIK MAY 20, 2003. </p><p>HARCHARIK STATED THAT "THE BALL IS IN THE COURT OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN MFA"  AND THAT FAO HAD MADE PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT </p><p>IT HAD NO OBJECTION TO THE MFA WITHDRAWING </p><p>AL-FITYAN\'S CREDENTIALS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) DURING OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM, EMBASSY ROME </p><p>REPEATEDLY PRESSED THE GOI MFA TO EXPEL AL-FITYAN, AS </p><p>INSTRUCTED, ALONG WITH OTHER IRAQI "DIPLOMATS".  THE </p><p>ITALIAN MFA DID EVENTUALLY EXPEL MOST OF THE IRAQI </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHOSE EXPULSION WE HAD REQUESTED. THE MFA </p><p>HOWEVER, HAVING NO PRECEDENT FOR EXPELLING SOMEONE </p><p>ACCREDITED TO FAO ON ESPIONAGE GROUNDS, DRAGGED ITS </p><p>FEET UNTIL SADDAM HAD FALLEN AND HAS SINCE TAKEN NO ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) SISMI TELLS ORCA IT TOLD THE ITALIAN MFA THAT IT HAD </p><p>NO OBJECTION TO THE MFA EXPELLING AL-FITYAN. ACCORDING TO </p><p>SISMI, WHICH HAS HAD CONTACT WITH AL-FITYAN SINCE, </p><p>HE CLAIMED NOT TO BE CONNECTED TO THE FORMER REGIME\'S </p><p>    INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, AND MADE VAGUE PROMISES OF </p><p>COOPERATION.  SISMI SEEMS DISINCLINED TO MOVE AGAINST HIM </p><p>NOW, SHOULD HE RETURN TO ROME  PRESUMABLY BECAUSE HE MAY BE </p><p>IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE SOMETHING VALUABLE.  SISMI </p><p>MONITORED AL-FITYAN CLOSELY BEFORE HE LEFT ROME, AND TELLS </p><p>ORCA THAT IT HAS NOT SEEN AL-FITYAN INVOLVED IN ANY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY SINCE THE REGIME FELL. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) ACTION REQUEST: EMBASSY WOULD APPRECIATE </p><p>RE-AFFIRMATION OF EARLIER INSTRUCTION </p><p>TO PRESS FIRST SISMI, THEN MFA, FOR EXPULSION OF </p><p>AL-FITYAN.  THIS PROCESS WOULD ALSO </p><p>BE SMOOTHED IF THE NEW IRAQI MFA ORDERED HIM RECALLED TO </p><p>BAGHDAD; IF CPA IS IN A POSITION </p><p>TO ENCOURAGE THIS ACTION, IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  END </p><p>ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ON A RELATED ISSUE, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHARGE AT </p><p>IRAQ\'S BILATERAL MISSION TO </p><p>ITALY, FARRIS AL-SHOQER (WHO HAPPENS TO BE AL-FITYAN\'S </p><p>BROTHER-IN-LAW), WILL BE RECALLED </p><p>BY THE IRAQI MFA.  WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE ITALIAN MFA, </p><p>HAS PREVIOUSLY DOWNPLAYED OUR </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT AL-SHOQER\'S OWN INTELLIGENCE CONNECTION </p><p>(REFTEL), TO MOVE TO EFFECT HIS </p><p>DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>8. MINIMIZE CONSIDERED </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03169 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
