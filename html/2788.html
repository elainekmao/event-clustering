<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000768 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: ATTEMPTS TO OUST PM APPARENTLY ON HOLD </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 731 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 657 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Ongoing attempts by former Prime Minister and Nepali </p><p>Congress Party President Girija Prasad Koirala to topple the </p><p>current Prime Minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, appear to be on </p><p>hold for the time being.  According to the Indian Ambassador, </p><p>PM Vajpayee, Minister for External Affairs Singh, Home </p><p>Minister Advani, Defense Minister Fernandes and the BJP </p><p>President had each discouraged Koirala during his current </p><p>visit from pursuing a no-confidence motion.  In an April 17 </p><p>meeting with Nepali Congress Party General Secretary (and </p><p>Koirala cousin) Sushil Koirala, the Ambassador stressed the </p><p>importance of a united political front to face down the </p><p>threat from the Maoist insurgency.  Sushil Koirala seemed to </p><p>take the message on board--albeit somewhat grudgingly--and </p><p>did not raise the subject of a change in government. </p><p>Although G.P. Koirala may be dissuaded for now, he can be </p><p>counted on to resume his machinations against Deuba the next </p><p>opportunity he sees.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>NEW DELHI SAID TO NIX KOIRALA CAMPAIGN </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Indian Ambassador to Nepal Singh told Ambassador </p><p>Malinowski April 17 that Prime Minister Vajpayee, Minister </p><p>for External Affairs Singh, Defense Minister Fernandes, Home </p><p>Minister Advani, and the BJP President had each told former </p><p>Nepali Prime Minister and current Nepali Congress Party </p><p>President Girija Prasad Koirala, in New Delhi for a visit, to </p><p>desist from efforts to topple his long-time rival, current </p><p>Nepali PM Sher Bahadur Deuba.  Ambassador Singh said G.P. </p><p>seemed to have got the unambiguous message that the Indians </p><p>would not support a change in government at the present and </p><p>expected him to stand down. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>NC GENERAL SECRETARY CALL ON AMBASSADOR </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On April 17 Nepali Congress General Secretary (and </p><p>G.P. cousin) Sushil Koirala called on Ambassador Malinowski </p><p>at the Residence.  Commending the April 15 all-party meeting </p><p>that resulted in a unanimous decision to oppose the April </p><p>23-27 Maoist general strike, the Ambassador stressed the </p><p>importance of party unity at this time of national crisis. </p><p>(Note:  Party leaders--including leaders of the Nepali </p><p>Congress--had boycotted an earlier all-party meeting called </p><p>by Deuba on March 27. End note.)  Of course all political </p><p>parties have differences and disagreements, the Ambassador </p><p>observed; thus it is especially heartening to see the parties </p><p>overcome these differences and stand united on this important </p><p>issue.  The USG fully recognizes the challenges before Nepal </p><p>and wants to be helpful; the Embassy has asked for a package </p><p>of security and development assistance to help Nepal overcome </p><p>the threat from the insurgency.  While we are pushing to get </p><p>this assistance in Washington, it is good to know the </p><p>political parties are doing what they can to help their own </p><p>country in its hour of need, the Ambassador concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Koirala said the Nepali Congress has been the main </p><p>target of Maoist aggression becaue it has always been the </p><p>champion of democracy.  Only his party has organized all of </p><p>the district party chairmen to oppose the Maoists, Koirala </p><p>claimed.  Why then should the Army Chief single out only </p><p>Deuba and "a few young ministers" as the only ones helping </p><p>the Army to stand up to the Maoists (Ref B).  Koirala said he </p><p>viewed the Army Chief\'s public comments as highly worrisome, </p><p>especially in light of the Army\'s historical role in backing </p><p>the Palace against the Nepali Congress in its early struggle </p><p>to bring democracy to Nepal.  Did the Army Chief\'s comments </p><p>signal some darker intention?  The Ambassador said both the </p><p>military leadership, including the Army Chief, and the King </p><p>had underscored to him on a number of occasions their respect </p><p>for the Constitution. The Army has no intention of staging a </p><p>coup, the Ambassador said; to do so would cost them not only </p><p>the support of the Nepali public but of foreign donors as </p><p>well.  In the continuing series of conversations with the </p><p>Palace, government and security forces, the U.S. has always </p><p>stressed the need for all to abide by the Constitution and to </p><p>respect human rights. </p><p>5.  (C)  Why are foreign donors so supportive of Deuba? </p><p>Koirala asked, adding he could not recall any previous PM </p><p>receiving similar support.  The Ambassador replied that </p><p>friends of Nepal are committed to helping the country through </p><p>this crisis.  Nepal\'s friends support the government\'s effort </p><p>and commitment to overcome this crisis, rather than a </p><p>particular individual.  He recalled during his previous </p><p>tenure as DCM and Charge in Nepal the USG working closely </p><p>with then-PM G.P. Koirala to give disaster relief assistance </p><p>in the wake of  especially destructive and unprecedented </p><p>flooding.  He also reminded Sushil Koirala of the help he and </p><p>other foreign emissaries had provided G.P. in countering a </p><p>series of violent bandhs in the early 1990s and in brokering </p><p>a rapprochement between G.P. and the major opposition party. </p><p>Neither the U.S. Embassy or the Ambassador himself is "for" </p><p>or "against" any particular political personality, he </p><p>emphasized; we support the democratically elected leader, </p><p>whoever it is, attempting to lead Nepal out of this crisis. </p><p>Koirala thanked the Ambassador for his views and left without </p><p>raising a possible change in government. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The Ambassador went over the same ground he went </p><p>over with Sushil Koirala in an April 18 meeting with Nepali </p><p>Congress MP and former Minister of Commerce and Health Ram </p><p>Krishna Tamarakar, a long-time G.P. ally.  Tamarakar, who </p><p>also is very close to Sushil Koirala, had sought a meeting </p><p>with the Ambassador, perhaps at the request of G.P. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The message should be crystal clear to Koirala and </p><p>his cohorts by now that a move to change PMs would not be </p><p>welcomed by the Palace; the Army; the donors; Nepal\'s </p><p>neighbor and largest trading partner, India; and, probably, </p><p>nearly half of the Nepali Congress Party.  (Sushil Koirala\'s </p><p>visit to the Ambassador was preceded immediately by a call on </p><p>the soon-to-be-departing British Ambassador, who, he told us, </p><p>delivered a similar message in rather forceful tones.  This </p><p>may in part explain Sushil\'s reticence during his </p><p>conversation with Amb. Malinowski.)  India\'s input, if as </p><p>reported, will likely prove critical in persuading G.P. </p><p>Koirala to hold off on his campaign for now.  We don\'t, </p><p>however, expect him to be dissuaded for long.  National </p><p>crisis or not, at the earliest opportunity--and he always </p><p>finds one--we expect G.P. to resume his chronic scheming to </p><p>regain the post of prime minister. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
