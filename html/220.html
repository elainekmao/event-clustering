<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L CAIRO 17073 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PINR, PINS, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  ESCAPE OF THREE ISLAMIC JIHAD MEMBERS FROM </p><p>PRISON </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  THREE MEMBERS OF THE ISLAMIC JIHAD </p><p>ORGANIZATION JAILED SINCE THE AFTERMATH OF THE OCTOBER </p><p>1981 ASSASSINATION OF SADAT ESCAPED JULY 17.  THEY </p><p>OVERPOWERED TWO GUARDS, STOLE THEIR WEAPONS AND ESCAPED </p><p>ON MAKESHIFT ROPE LADDERS, SPARKING RUMORS THAT THEY </p><p>HAD BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE.  THOSE </p><p>SUSPECTED OF LINKS WITH ISLAMIC JIHAD ARE BEING ROUNDED </p><p>UP FOR QUESTIONING, AND AN ENRAGED ZAKI BADR HAS SACKED </p><p>A NUMBER OF HIS OFFICERS.  HOWEVER, WE ARE ALSO HEARING </p><p>GRUMBLINGS THAT THE INTERIOR MINISTER\'S POLICY OF </p><p>SUMMARY TRANSFERS AND OTHER PUNISHMENTS FOR MINOR </p><p>INFRACTIONS HAS CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE OF TIMIDITY IN </p><p>WHICH OPERATIONS SUCH AS THIS ESCAPE ARE EASIER TO PULL </p><p>OFF.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THREE MEMBERS OF THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION </p><p>WHO WERE IMPLICATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF ANWAR SADAT </p><p>IN OCTOBER 1981 ESCAPED FROM THE MAXIMUM SECURITY AL </p><p>TORAH PRISON IN CAIRO BEFORE DAWN JULY 17.  SECURITY </p><p>FORCES SNARLED RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC IN A FRUITLESS SEARCH </p><p>FOR THE ESCAPEES, BUT REFRAINED FROM ANY ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>OF THE PRISON BREAK UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON.  A BRIEF </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTRY STATEMENT SAID THAT A SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>REWARD WOULD BE OFFERED FOR THEIR CAPTURE.  THE THREE </p><p>WERE IDENTIFIED AS KHAMIS MOHAMMED MOSSLAM, MOHAMMED </p><p>MAHMOUD EL-ASWANI, AND ESAMEDDIN EL-KAMARI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AN EMBASSY SOURCE WITH EXCELLENT CONTACTS IN </p><p>THE SECURITY FORCES SAID THAT THE THREE APPARENTLY </p><p>ESCAPED ABOUT FIVE AM ON JULY 17, BUT THEIR ABSENCE WAS </p><p>NOT DETECTED UNTIL A ROLL CALL SEVERAL HOURS LATER. </p><p>THE THREE WERE HOUSED IN A SINGLE CELL FROM WHICH THEY </p><p>ESCAPED BY PULLING OUT AN AIR VENT AND THEN </p><p>OVERPOWERING A GUARD.  THEY TOOK HIS WEAPON AND MADE </p><p>THEIR WAY TO THE PRISON WALLS WHERE THEY OVERCAME A </p><p>SECOND GUARD IN THE WATCHTOWER AND THEN WENT OVER THE </p><p>WALL USING IMPROVISED ROPE LADDERS.  CONTRARY TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS, OUR SOURCE SAID THAT NO SHOTS WERE FIRED, BUT </p><p>BOTH GUARDS WERE BADLY INJURED.  THE ESCAPEES MADE OFF </p><p>WITH THEIR SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND SOME 200 ROUNDS </p><p>OF AMMUNITION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) OUR SOURCE DESCRIBED EL-KAMARI AS BY FAR THE </p><p>MOST DANGEROUS OF THE THREE.  HE IS A FORMER MAJOR IN </p><p>THE ARMY\'S ELITE RANGER BATTALION AND HAS A REPUTATION </p><p>FOR INTELLIGENCE AND RUTHLESSNESS.  HE IS BELIEVED TO </p><p>BE THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF ISLAMIC JIHAD\'S "MILITARY" WING, </p><p>BUT SINCE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE LINKING HIM DIRECTLY </p><p>WITH SADAT\'S ASSASSINATION, HE WAS NOT GIVEN THE DEATH </p><p>PENALTY.  MOSSLAM AND ASWANI WERE CHARGED WITH THE </p><p>MURDER OF A POLICE OFFICER IN 1981.  OUR SOURCE SAID </p><p>THE FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN HANDLED VERY HARSHLY BY </p><p>AUTHORITIES AFTER THEIR ARREST HAS CONVINCED SECURITY </p><p>FORCES THAT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RECAPTURE THEM </p><p>WITHOUT A BATTLE.  IN AN EFFORT TO TRACE THE ESCAPEES, </p><p>A ROUNDUP OF INDIVIDUALS KNOWN OR BELIEVED TO HAVE </p><p>CONTACTS/SYMPATHIES WITH ISLAMIC JIHAD HAS ALREADY </p><p>BEGUN, AS HAS THE INTERROGATION OF A JIHADIST STILL IN </p><p>AL TORAH PRISON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE ESCAPE OF THE THREE WILL BE A MAJOR </p><p>EMBARRASSMENT TO INTERIOR MINISTER ZAKI BADR AFTER A </p><p>PUBLICIZED STRING OF SUCCESSES AGAINST TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS.  HE MOVED IMMEDIATELY TO CASHIER THE HEAD OF </p><p>THE PRISONS DEPARTMENT, AND OUR SECURITY SOURCE SAID </p><p>THAT OVER TWO DOZEN OTHER OFFICERS HAVE BEEN CALLED IN </p><p>FOR QUESTIONING OR SUSPENDED FROM THEIR DUTIES.  THE </p><p>APPARENT EASE OF THE ESCAPE HAS ALREADY SPARKED RUMORS </p><p>THAT THE THREE HAD ASSISTANCE FROM BOTH INSIDE AND </p><p>OUTSIDE THE PRISON.  OUR SOURCE ADDED THAT MANY OF HIS </p><p>CONTACTS, ALREADY DEMORALIZED BY THE INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER\'S AUTOCRATIC AND INTIMIDATING WAYS, ARE </p><p>GRUMBLING THAT HIS POLICIES OF PUNISHMENT AND SUMMARY </p><p>TRANSFER FOR THE SLIGHTEST INFRACTION HAVE CREATED AN </p><p>ATMOSPHERE OF TIMIDITY AND DISCONTINUITY THAT HAMPERS </p><p>THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SECURITY SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WISNER </p><p></p></div>
