Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on </p><p>7/17 entitled "National security and narco trafficking". "Drug </p><p>trafficking and organized crime which have recently established </p><p>criminal networks in Honduras, closely related to criminal bands </p><p>in Colombia, have evidenced that the Honduran state doesn\'t </p><p>enforce law and neither does it have control over its territory </p><p>and its population, particularly in the departments of Olancho, </p><p>Gracias a Dios and Colon." </p><p> </p><p>"It\'s a fact that the society and the state are being threatened. </p><p>the notion of national security that involved a blatant violation </p><p>of fundamental human rights in the past should be reoriented </p><p>toward its true meaning: the defense of the common well being, </p><p>protect the population\'s health and life, the environment and </p><p>social cohesion which are being seriously jeopardized by the </p><p>advance of the globalization of crime." </p><p> </p><p>2. Article in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on </p><p>7/17 entitled "Gigantic cocaine seizure". "Police authorities </p><p>seized about 2,300 kilos of cocaine in a freighter near Roatan." </p><p> </p><p>"The Minister of Security Oscar Alvarez said that this seizure </p><p>proved once more that the current authorities are determined to </p><p>fight against drug trafficking." </p><p> </p><p>"For months, the US Ambassador Larry Palmer has highlighted the </p><p>scarce results Honduras has achieved in the fight against drug </p><p>trafficking, and a few days ago he affirmed that the country was </p><p>on the way to become a narco state. Alvarez stated, `we are </p><p>sending a clear and compelling message that drug traffickers </p><p>shouldn\'t dare to turn Honduras into a narco state, and I\'m sure </p><p>that we are still far from this situation\'." </p><p> </p><p>"Alvarez said that he had talked to the US Ambassador Larry </p><p>Palmer, expressing his satisfaction because President Maduro is </p><p>proving his will to directly fight against this threat." </p><p> </p><p>3. Article in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on </p><p>7/17 entitled "The Public Ministry is investigating the ten most </p><p>important narcos". "Roy Medina, head of the Public Ministry, </p><p>confirmed that ten leaders of the narco trafficking cartels </p><p>operating in Honduras are being investigated by this </p><p>institution." </p><p> </p><p>"Medina affirmed, `We are already getting some results, everyone </p><p>knows about the case in San Esteban, Olancho where we arrested </p><p>nine people, including a Congressman and we are also </p><p>investigating the case of the cocaine shipment found in Utila </p><p>this week. however, until we finish the prosecution process, we </p><p>will disclose the names of those responsible of these acts\'." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
