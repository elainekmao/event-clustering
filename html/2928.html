<p>UNCLAS HANOI 001189 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAO, OIIP, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT:  ARMY DAILY SEEKS TO PROMOTE GOOD RELATIONS WITH U.S. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY. THE PEOPLE\'S ARMY DAILY IS DETERMINED TO </p><p>HELP STRENGTHEN BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. AND MIGHT </p><p>BE WILLING TO USE PAS-PRODUCED MATERIALS, ITS EDITOR TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR ON MAY 9.  THE EDITOR EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>ANTI-SRV VIETNAMESE IN THE U.S. AND THE IMPACT OF THE </p><p>VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  MAJOR GENERAL NGUYEN QUANG THONG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF </p><p>OF THE PEOPLE\'S ARMY NEWSPAPER (QUAN DOI NHAN DAN), TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR, PAO, AND POL/C ON MAY 9 THAT HIS NEWSPAPER\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01189  131058Z </p><p>EDITORIAL STANCE WAS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING MUTUAL </p><p>UNDERSTANDING AND FRIENDSHIP, INCLUDING WITH THE U.S., </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH THE MUTUAL INTERESTS OF BOTH COUNTRIES.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT THAT THE PAPER HAD REPORTED ON POSITIVE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, ESPECIALLY ON </p><p>DIPLOMATIC AND COMMERCIAL TIES AS WELL AS US HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE PAPER FOLLOWED AN </p><p>"INDEPENDENT" EDITORIAL POLICY NOT DIRECTLY GUIDED BY THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OR THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM\'S </p><p>(CPV) PROPAGANDA ORGAN.  HE ADMITTED THAT "IN REALITY" HIS </p><p>EDITORIAL LINE "REFLECTED" OVERALL DIRECTIONS AND TRENDS SET </p><p>BY THE CPV, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  WHEN GENERAL THONG ADMITTED THAT SOME OF THE </p><p>PAPER\'S SIGNED COMMENTARIES WERE FROM "GUEST WRITERS" </p><p>INCLUDING FOREIGNERS, THE AMBASSADOR ASKED ABOUT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF USING ARTICLES PROVIDED BY THE EMBASSY. </p><p>THONG SAID THAT THIS WOULD BE POSSIBLE, IF THEY WERE </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EDITORIAL POLICY.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED THE VALUE IN EXPANDING UNDERSTANDING IN </p><p>VIETNAM OF THE US VIEW OF THE RELATIONSHIP, AND THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF DISPELLING SOME OF THE "DISTRUST" OF THE U.S. </p><p>STILL SOMETIMES REFLECTED IN THE PAPER\'S SIGNED </p><p>COMMENTARIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  GENERAL THONG NOTED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THERE WAS </p><p>LITTLE COVERAGE OF VIETNAM BY THE US PRESS.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>AGREED THAT THIS WAS TRUE, AND STRESSED THAT VIETNAM\'S </p><p>PROBLEM WAS NOT THAT PEOPLE IN THE U.S. WERE UNDERTAKING </p><p>"SINISTER PLOTS" AGAINST VIETNAM SUCH AS "PEACEFUL </p><p>EVOLUTION," BUT RATHER THAT SO FEW PEOPLE IN THE U.S. WERE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01189  131058Z </p><p>INTERESTED IN VIETNAM AT ALL.  HE NOTED THAT ONE BY-PRODUCT </p><p>OF EXPANDED TRADE RELATIONS WOULD BE THAT MORE COMPANIES AND </p><p>INDIVIDUALS IN THE U.S. WOULD HAVE A STAKE IN THE BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, ARGUE VIETNAM\'S CASE TO CONGRESS, AND INCREASE </p><p>AND BROADEN THE BILATERAL FRIENDSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  GENERAL THONG POINTED TO SOME VIETNAMESE IN THE </p><p>U.S. WHO WERE ANTI-SRV, AND POINTED TO THE VIETNAM HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ACT AS AN EXAMPLE OF THEIR NEGATIVE EFFORTS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT VOCAL INTEREST GROUPS IN THE U.S. CAN </p><p>OFTEN HAVE AN IMPACT DISPROPORTIONATE TO THEIR NUMBERS IN </p><p>SECURING PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT EXPRESSES CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>OPINION WITH LIMITED PRACTICAL EFFECT, ESPECIALLY IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF LOCAL CONSTITUENTS WHO OPPOSE IT.  GENERAL THONG </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE LONGER-TERM EFFECT OF SUCH </p><p>RESOLUTIONS AND LAWS WOULD BE TO SHAPE USG POLICY, NOT JUST </p><p>EXPRESS CONGRESSIONAL OPINIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT, </p><p>IN THE 21ST CENTURY, ALL COUNTRIES MUST GET USED TO </p><p>INCREASED ATTENTION FROM ONE ANOTHER.  GENERAL THONG WENT ON </p><p>TO CRITICIZE US REPORTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS SOMETIMES SLANDEROUS AND NOT REFLECTING </p><p>THE REAL SITUATION IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  COMMENT:  THE MAY 10 EDITION OF QUAN DOI NHAN DAN </p><p>REPORTED FAVORABLY ON THE AMBASSADOR\'S VISIT ON ITS BACK </p><p>PAGE (INTERNATIONAL), HIGHLIGHTING THAT GENERAL THONG HAD </p><p>TOLD HIM THE NEWSPAPER WAS RESOLVED TO FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>WRONGFUL VIEWPOINTS THAT GO AGAINST THE NORMALIZATION </p><p>PROCESS OF VIETNAM-US RELATIONS.  ON THE FRONT PAGE, </p><p>HOWEVER, WAS ANOTHER SIGNED COMMENTARY LAMBASTING US </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES FOR DISTORTING THE HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01189  131058Z </p><p>SITUATION VIETNAM, IMPOSING "IRRATIONAL CONDITIONS" ON THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, AND REVIEWING ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE US </p><p>MILITARY DURING THE WAR THAT HAD VIOLATED VIETNAMESE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS.  OUR ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH QUAN DOI NHAN DAN STILL </p><p>HAS A LONG WAY TO GO, BUT WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO TESTING </p><p>GENERAL THONG\'S APPARENT OFFER TO USE MORE PAS-PRODUCED </p><p>MATERIALS. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
