<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 002251 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CA, Paul Martin, Liberal Party </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA: LIBERAL LEADERSHIP RACE DOWN TO TWO, </p><p>ADVANTAGE PAUL MARTIN </p><p> </p><p>REF: OTTAWA 2091 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora. Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C/NF) SUMMARY:  The Liberal Party will formally elect a </p><p>new party Leader on November 15, but that individual will </p><p>not/not become Prime Minister of Canada until incumbent Jean </p><p>Chretien\'s retirement - announced for February 2004. With </p><p>only two leadership contenders remaining, the question is not </p><p>whether former Finance Minister Paul Martin will become Prime </p><p>Minister but when.  Though many pundits assert that Chretien </p><p>would never want to facilitate a Martin transition to power </p><p>by leaving early, Embassy sources (protect) suggest the PM </p><p>may in fact be considering a December exit.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) With the party membership drive ended on June 21, the </p><p>next hurdle in the contest for leadership of the Liberal </p><p>Party is the selection of delegates to the Liberals\' </p><p>Leadership Convention in six weeks\' time.  Some 400,000 </p><p>registered Liberals across 301 ridings nationwide will choose </p><p>representatives (13 per riding) to the November Convention </p><p>the weekend of September 20-21.  This year\'s process will </p><p>inaugurate reforms designed to bring the selection of the </p><p>party leader and eventual PM of the country closer to the </p><p>grass roots level of the party:  Delegates will be chosen </p><p>according to a procedure incorporating the percentage results </p><p>of a popular vote taken among the membership of each riding </p><p>association to reflect actual candidate support. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Following Deputy PM John Manley\'s decision to bow out </p><p>of the race (reftel), general expectations are high that the </p><p>delegate selection process will demonstrate overwhelming </p><p>support for Paul Martin--a centrist candidate--as the next </p><p>party Leader.  Though Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, the </p><p>remaining other candidate, enjoys a certain "cult following," </p><p>her left-of-center ideological bent is deemed too narrow for </p><p>most Liberals. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Martin insiders still are careful to maintain a </p><p>"cautiously optimistic" demeanor on prospects for their </p><p>candidate.  At the same time, public political support for </p><p>Martin\'s bid has continued to grow even during Canada\'s </p><p>traditionally slower summer cottage season. The most recent </p><p>Cabinet-level endorsement came last week from International </p><p>Cooperation Minister Susan Whelan, a Manley supporter, whose </p><p>support brings to "at least 31" (out of a possible 39) the </p><p>number of Cabinet members backing Paul Martin. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C/NF) COMMENT:  Given Chretien\'s ingrained antipathy </p><p>toward his likely successor and longstanding political rival, </p><p>veteran political observers expect the PM -- against all </p><p>reason -- to throw obstacles in Martin\'s path.  This would </p><p>include staying on as PM until the bitter end.  At the same </p><p>time, at least one senior official told Ambassador Cellucci </p><p>that Chretien likely will depart in December, and that a </p><p>Martin cabinet could be sworn in before year-end.  Adding </p><p>credence to this scenario is reliable information from a </p><p>contact of the DCM (please protect) that a senior advisor </p><p>close to the PM has lined up employment with a prominent </p><p>Ottawa firm beginning January 1, 2004. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C/NF) COMMENT (cont\'d):  The Martin camp is maintaining </p><p>silence on what they do or do not know about Chretien\'s </p><p>plans. Other than to acknowledge that transition issues (such </p><p>as prospective Cabinet appointments) are on hold until after </p><p>the September delegate selection results, Martin\'s campaign </p><p>advisors claim no contact with the Chretien team. The </p><p>candidate himself (protect) commented to Ambassador Cellucci </p><p>that their recent meeting far exceeded the sum of his </p><p>exchanges with the Prime Minister in the past year. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
