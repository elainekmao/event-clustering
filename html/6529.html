(C) On March 13, DART Field Office/North personnel </p><p>met with Andre Lapierriere (Protect Source), UNICEF,s </p><p>Head of Northern Operations for Iraq.  UNICEF </p><p>contingency plans are based on providing emergency </p><p>relief to more than 250,000 people, with 40 percent </p><p>of that population being absorbed </p><p>into the homes of local communities.  UNICEF is </p><p>concerned that, at present, pre-positioned </p><p>commodities in northern Iraq will only meet 30 </p><p> percent of the potential needs of 250,000 displaced </p><p>people.  Lapierriere identified the need </p><p>for additional pre-positioning of blankets, tents, </p><p>emergency supplies for hospitals, clothing for children, </p><p>and water bladders.  UNICEF Head of Northern Operations </p><p>for Iraq indicated that if hostilities last longer than </p><p>30 days and/or more than 250,000 people are displaced, </p><p>there will be significant food and medicine shortages </p><p>in the three northern provinces of Dehuk, Irbil, and </p><p>Sulaymaniyah. </p><p>End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>UNICEF Activities in Northern Iraq </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (C) UNICEF,s role in northern Iraq focuses on the </p><p>primary health care, shelter, and water and sanitation </p><p>sectors.  In the water and sanitation sector, UNICEF has </p><p>installed more than 1,000 km of pipes and dug hundreds </p><p>of wells throughout most of the three northern Iraqi </p><p>provinces. UNICEF,s Head of Northern Operations for </p><p>Iraq reported that 95 percent of the northern areas </p><p> have access to potable water.  In the primary health </p><p>sector, UNICEF is focusing on providing medicine and </p><p>technical support to health clinics </p><p>in the three northern provinces of Dehuk, Irbil, and </p><p>Sulaymaniyah. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) UNICEF reported that, based on a planning </p><p>figure of 250,000 displaced during a potential </p><p>conflict, only 30 percent of shelter needs (blankets, </p><p> tents, etc.) have been pre-positioned in northern </p><p>Iraq to date.  This pre-positioned cache includes </p><p> 50,000 blankets and an </p><p>undefined number of cooking sets and tents.  While </p><p>UNICEF has the mechanism in place to pre-position, </p><p>warehouse, and distribute non-food items in </p><p>northern Iraq, UNICEF does not have additional </p><p> funds available to do so.  DART Field Office/North </p><p> has identified UNICEF as the only </p><p>international organization with the capacity to </p><p>distribute non-food items in northern Iraq from </p><p> Turkey.  To date, no NGOs are registered with </p><p> the Government of Turkey (GOT) to transit </p><p>humanitarian supplies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) UNICEF,s Head of Northern Operations for Iraq </p><p>indicated the United Nations Office of Project Services </p><p>(UN OPS) has the jurisdiction over generators and power </p><p>sources in northern Iraq.  However, under the regulations </p><p> of the Oil-for-Food program, UN OPS is unable to train </p><p>local Iraqi,s on maintenance of these power systems. </p><p>UNICEF Head of Northern Operations for Iraq in concerned </p><p>that if the Oil-for-Food program is broken, the power </p><p>supply system in northern Iraq could be in jeopardy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Lapierriere identified a need for local medical </p><p>officials in northern Iraq to receive information on </p><p>responding to a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, </p><p>Nuclear, or Explosion (CBRNE) attack.  UNICEF,s Head </p><p>of Northern Operations for Iraq indicated that a </p><p>workshop for local staff on CBRNE in northern Iraq </p><p>for first responders could calm concerns of the northern </p><p> Iraqi population. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>UNICEF,s Concerns </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>6.  (C) UNICEF identified the need for additional </p><p>non-food items to be pre-positioned in northern Iraq </p><p>as soon as possible, including, in order of priority, </p><p>more than 100,000 blankets, 1,000 tents, emergency </p><p>supplies for hospitals, clothing for children, and </p><p>water bladders.  DART Field Office/North discussed </p><p>the idea of pre-positioning emergency relief supplies, </p><p>such as blankets, tents, etc., in northern Iraq with </p><p>UNICEF.  UNICEF indicated that they are in a </p><p>position to facilitate the delivery of emergency relief </p><p>supplies to warehouses in northern Iraq.  Additionally, </p><p>the availability of fuel for cooking and operating </p><p>vehicles is a concern.  If the Oil-for-Food program </p><p>stops, local UNICEF staff will not receive salaries </p><p>because of lack of funds, raising concerns of UNICEF,s </p><p> ability to maintain its network of employees over a </p><p>long period of time.  UNICEF Field Representative </p><p>indicated that if hostilities last longer than 30 days </p><p>and/or more than 250,000 people are displaced, there </p><p>will be significant food shortages in the three northern </p><p>provinces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) UNICEF, in consultation with U.N. Joint Logistics </p><p>Center (UNJLC), has identified four logistical contingency </p><p>plans to bring medicine to the people of northern Iraq </p><p>in the event of hostilities.  UNICEF,s first option is to </p><p>transport medicine and emergency relief supplies by truck </p><p>from the Turkish port of Mercin to the three northern </p><p>provinces.  UNICEF currently has $4 million worth of </p><p>emergency medicine in Mersin waiting transport to </p><p>northern Iraq.  If transport through Turkey becomes </p><p> more problematic, then UNICEF contingency plans call </p><p>for the medicine to be airlifted into secure </p><p>locations in northern Iraq.  In the event that airlifting </p><p>medicine is not an option, UNICEF plans call for emergency </p><p>relief supplies to be transported through Syria and Iran. </p><p>UNICEF,s Field Representative reported that UNICEF </p><p>personnel are currently conducting an assessment in Syria </p><p>to assess conditions for transport from Syria to northern </p><p> Iraq. </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>NGO Presence in Northern Iraq </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>8.  (SBU) UNICEF,s Head of Northern Operations for Iraq </p><p>identified eight international NGOs that have established </p><p>programs in northern Iraq, as well as the sectors that </p><p>they work in: Save the Children/United Kingdom (shelter, </p><p>protection of IDPs), PeaceWinds Japan (health, water and </p><p>sanitation),STEP (education), Yanconia (protection of </p><p>IDPs), Premerogance (education), Qandil (water and </p><p>sanitation, protection of IDPs), Mines Advisory Group </p><p>(demining), and Response, Relief, Resettlement, and </p><p>Rehabilitation (advocacy).  According to UNICEF, all </p><p>international staff for these organizations have been </p><p>evacuated from northern Iraq.  UNICEF representative </p><p> singled out Save the Children/UK as having a </p><p>significant presence in northern Iraq with </p><p>knowledgeable local staff to conduct emergency response </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>DART Field Office/North Requests for Action </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>9.  (C) Request for Action.  DART Field Office/North </p><p>requests that additional international disaster assistance </p><p>funds be made available to UNICEF for the pre-positioning </p><p>of 50,000 blankets and 1,000 tents in northern Iraq </p><p>through Turkey.  Additionally, DART Field Office/North </p><p>requests that these commodities be purchased in Turkey </p><p>as a visible indication to the GOT that the USG and </p><p>international community is actively working on </p><p>contingency plans to stabilize the northern Iraqi </p><p>population in place, minimize movement of displaced </p><p>persons, and reduce the potential humanitarian burden </p><p> on the GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
