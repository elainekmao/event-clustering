<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000762 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/PDA(BUCKLEY), WHA/CEN, PD TASK FORCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ MARCH 3/22-24/03 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  "El Heraldo" moderate Tegucigalpa-based daily 3/22: </p><p>Apuntes: "The European Union, the Republic of China and </p><p>Vladimir Putin have discovered that Bush can count on the </p><p>complete support of the Senate, including that of senators </p><p>who were against the Iraq invasion." "The U.S. is the empire </p><p>no matter who is in power, and the `empire\' won\'t stop until </p><p>it consolidates its rule of the planet.unless, of course, a </p><p>bipolar world re-emerges with the Europeans or Chinese on </p><p>one side and the U.S. on the other." </p><p> </p><p>2. "El Heraldo" "Shock and Awe" 3/24: The unpopular invasion </p><p>of Iraq is in its most devastating phase - the  `Shock and </p><p>Awe\' phase, which equals `terrorism\' according to some of </p><p>the posters held by protesters. There are many people who </p><p>lived the terror and lost dear ones on September 11 </p><p>participating in the protests against the war. They better </p><p>than anyone understand the pain and damage caused by </p><p>terrorism --the longer this war lasts, the bigger will be </p><p>the number of victims."  Now that the U.S. has broken </p><p>international law with the invasion, we have no choice but </p><p>to pray for this nightmare to end sooner than later so that </p><p>the Iraqi people can stop suffering." </p><p> </p><p>3. "El Heraldo" 3/22, "Pandora\'s Box"  by Noe Pineda </p><p>Portillo. </p><p>"The attempt to force the U.N. Security Counsel to authorize </p><p>military action opened a large breach between the U.S and </p><p>the countries that supported a diplomatic resolution." </p><p>Before opening the Pandora\'s box, the U.S. and England </p><p>should have listened and pondered the U.N. role, and </p><p>understood that the world is a system of nations. </p><p> </p><p>" Bush believes that those who criticize its unilateral war </p><p>against Iraq are opposed the U.S.  That is a false </p><p>assumption.  It is public knowledge that Saddam Hussein is a </p><p>dictator even with his own family.  But it is up to the </p><p>International Court of Justice to look for a resolution </p><p>through a course of action like they did with Milosevic.  A </p><p>one-sided war will not only bring terrible economic </p><p>consequences, it\'ll increase Islam reaction around the </p><p>world, exacerbating fundamentalism to a real terrorist </p><p>threat around the globe." </p><p> </p><p>4. El Heraldo 3/24  - in their daily section called "Today\'s </p><p>villain," "Today\'s Hero,--"the Villain was "Fidel Castro: </p><p>For taking advantage of the war against Iraq to send to </p><p>prison those who oppose to his communist regime." The Hero </p><p>was Pacifism: "For bringing hope to people around the world </p><p>and standing against those who love death, pain and </p><p>destruction." </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
