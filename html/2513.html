<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000410 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, PREL, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NATIONWIDE STRIKE BRINGS SCATTERED VIOLENCE, </p><p>INSURGENTS ATTACK REMOTE POLICE POST </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) KATHMANDU 380, B) 01 KATHMANDU 2388 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Insurgents attacked a remote police </p><p>post in Salyan district, killing 34 policemen, on the eve </p><p>of a strike called by the Maoists for February 22 and 23. </p><p>Scattered bombings were reported throughout the country in </p><p>the run-up to the strike, including a fatal incident along </p><p>a major road in Kathmandu early on February 22.  As the </p><p>strike began, businesses remained closed and </p><p>transportation throughout the country came to a halt. </p><p>Although the government has public sentiment on its side </p><p>in the struggle against the Maoists, a worsening resource </p><p>crunch prevents an effective response to the insurgency\'s </p><p>guerrilla tactics.  Suggested press guidance follows </p><p>paragraph 6.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>On Eve of Strike, Maoists Attack Police... </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Maoist insurgents called a nationwide strike for </p><p>February 22 and 23, the first such attempted action since </p><p>December 7 (Ref B).  In contrast to the uneventful </p><p>December action, the number of bombings and violent </p><p>attacks reported throughout the country have increased in </p><p>the run-up to the February strike.  At 11:00 p.m. February </p><p>21, Maoists launched an attack on a remote police post in </p><p>Sitalpati, Salyan District, approximately 300 miles west </p><p>of Kathmandu.  According to Salyan\'s Chief District </p><p>Officer (CDO), 34 of the 80 police officers stationed at </p><p>the post were killed in the hour-and-a-half long siege. </p><p>An undetermined number of insurgents were also killed, </p><p>their bodies taken away by their comrades.  The CDO also </p><p>reported that groups of Maoists had gathered on the </p><p>outskirts of the district capital, intending to attack it, </p><p>but had fled at the sight of two army helicopters </p><p>dispatched to the area. </p><p> </p><p>And Scatter Bombs </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) On the morning of February 21 security forces </p><p>shot and killed a Maoist insurgent who was attempting to </p><p>hang a "banner bomb" on a pole in the capital.  During the </p><p>day at least five other bombs went off around the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley and a car belonging to an army pilot was </p><p>firebombed.  In other areas of Nepal scattered incidents </p><p>of violence were also reported, including the firebombing </p><p>of a long-distance bus in Chitwan District that took the </p><p>lives of five passengers. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) A few minutes past nine on the morning of </p><p>February 22 a bomb went off in a garbage pile near a </p><p>telecommunications office in the Chabahil neighborhood of </p><p>Kathmandu.  Police confirmed that one woman, a garbage </p><p>collector, was killed.  Minutes later a second bomb </p><p>reportedly went off in the same location. </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Threat Closes Nepal </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Shops on the capital\'s main streets stayed closed </p><p>February 22 and most public conveyances remained garaged. </p><p>Armed police and military personnel were out in force.  A </p><p>few private motorists ventured out, their license plates </p><p>obscured behind plain white paper.  In Thamel, the tourist </p><p>district, travelers waited in vain for taxicabs or </p><p>wandered aimlessly among the shuttered storefronts as </p><p>soldiers passed by in jeeps mounted with machine guns. </p><p>One major hotel seized on the lack of traffic to scrub </p><p>down its empty parking lot.  Sources in small cities </p><p>throughout Nepal\'s plains and hill districts reported </p><p>similar conditions, with few shop owners daring to open </p><p>for trade and most motorized vehicles sitting idle.  The </p><p>head of a local beverage concern reported that earlier in </p><p>the week truck drivers had refused to make long-distance </p><p>hauls for fear of the impending strike. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The violence leading up to the nationwide strike </p><p>came while the Parliament debated on and then extended the </p><p>state of emergency for another three months (Septel), and </p><p>no doubt strengthened the hand of those who wanted the </p><p>extension.  The Maoists will not make any new converts by </p><p>threatening more violence and strangling Nepal\'s already </p><p>lagging economy - most Nepalis expressed frustration mixed </p><p>with anger when asked about the effects of the strike. </p><p>The recent brutal attacks in Achham District (Ref A) have </p><p>instilled a very real sense of fear among ordinary </p><p>Nepalis, even here in the Kathmandu Valley.  Although the </p><p>government now has a mandate to continue the emergency, </p><p>the increasing strain on the state\'s resources means it </p><p>will continue to have difficulty countering the </p><p>insurgents\' guerrilla campaign. </p><p> </p><p>Suggested Press Guidance </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. Begin Suggested Press Guidance: </p><p>The Government of the United States denounces the acts of </p><p>violence and terror perpetrated by Maoist insurgents in </p><p>the run-up to the national strike called for February 22 </p><p>and 23, including the attack in Salyan District during the </p><p>night of February 21 that took the lives of 34 police </p><p>officers.  A series of explosions in and around Kathmandu </p><p>have resulted in at least one death.  We extend our </p><p>condolences to the families of the victims of this </p><p>senseless bloodshed. </p><p> </p><p>Strikes or "bandhs" such as the one called by the Maoists </p><p>for February 22 and 23 are enforced by the threat of </p><p>violence.  We reiterate our support for the right of the </p><p>Government of Nepal to safeguard its citizens, as provided </p><p>for under the Constitution.  In a democracy there is no </p><p>room to achieve political objectives through violence. </p><p> </p><p>Once more we urge the Maoists to lay down their arms </p><p>immediately and to engage in the peaceful pursuit of their </p><p>aims within the democratic framework of Nepal\'s </p><p>Constitution. </p><p> </p><p>End Suggested Press Guidance. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
