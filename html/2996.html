<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000990 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>ROME FOR USMISSION </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PGOV, PREL, EAID, AORC, NP, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: VISIT WITH JAILED BHUTANESE REFUGEE S.K. PRADHAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 425 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 01 KATHMANDU 1913 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  In a meeting with Embassy visitors to his </p><p>jail in southeastern Nepal, prominent Bhutanese refugee and </p><p>human rights activist S.K. Pradhan protested his innocence in </p><p>the case of another refugee leader\'s murder.  Pradhan said he </p><p>had nothing to gain from the man\'s death and did not </p><p>understand what drove the late leader\'s associate to file a </p><p>complaint against more than forty individuals, including </p><p>himself.  Pradhan has been treated well during his detention, </p><p>a fact he ascribes to his jailers\' belief that he is getting </p><p>a raw deal.  Problems with Nepal\'s civil code and criminal </p><p>procedures have prevented him from enjoying due process, he </p><p>asserted.  Well-connected internationally, Pradhan has </p><p>marshaled wide support, including from prominent Nepalis and </p><p>even Government of Nepal (GON) officials.  Pradhan is largely </p><p>a prisoner of an ineffective legal system, though his case </p><p>also reflects divisions within the Bhutanese refugee </p><p>community that are a microcosm of the factionalism that </p><p>afflicts Nepal\'s politics.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Poloff and visiting DRL/PHD Officer Gianni Paz met </p><p>jailed Bhutanese refugee and human rights activist S.K. </p><p>Pradhan at the Jhapa District branch jail during a recent </p><p>visit to southeastern Nepal.  Pradhan was arrested September </p><p>19, 2001, and charged with conspiracy in the September 9, </p><p>2001 murder of R.K. Budhatoki, another refugee activist (Ref </p><p>B).  Pradhan\'s arrest came after an associate of Budhatoki </p><p>filed a complaint naming 43 individuals as parties to the </p><p>conspiracy (Ref A).  Altogether eleven individuals remain in </p><p>custody under this complaint. </p><p> </p><p>Pradhan Protests Prosecution </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Pradhan denied any involvement in Budathoki,s murder, </p><p>for which he said he was falsely implicated.  Budathoki was </p><p>not an enemy, he told us, and besides he would have nothing </p><p>to gain from Budathoki,s death.  Altogether nine Bhutanese </p><p>refugees were arrested; all now reside in the same jail as </p><p>Pradhan.  The killer had reportedly gone to India, Pradhan </p><p>had heard.  Pradhan said he tried - without success - to </p><p>contact the person who filed the complaint.  He did not know </p><p>what drove the man, whose name is Poudel, to file a complaint </p><p>against more than 40 people, including Pradhan himself: </p><p>"that,s the hundred million dollar question." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Relating the story of his confinement, Pradhan said </p><p>that a group of men in plainclothes came to his house and </p><p>told him he was under arrest.  He asked the men to show </p><p>identification and a warrant, both of which they refused to </p><p>produce.  Pradhan then contacted officers at his local police </p><p>post, who came to the house and positively identified the men </p><p>as police.  Only after he was put in detention did he learn </p><p>that a complaint had been filed against him. </p><p> </p><p>Well-Treated in Jail </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Pradhan described conditions in the jail as good, and </p><p>added that jailers and fellow inmates alike treat him with </p><p>respect.  He had no health problems, and had not been beaten </p><p>or tortured.  He occupies a "special room," less crowded than </p><p>the others - but still shared with seventeen other men. </p><p>Special arrangements have been made to allow Pradhan visits - </p><p>including conjugal visits - and telephone privileges.  (Note: </p><p> On two occasions in the past, Emboff was permitted to speak </p><p>to Pradhan on the telephone (Ref A).  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Pradhan told us he believes he gets special treatment </p><p>"because they think I am innocent."  He added that he is </p><p>well-behaved and does not cause trouble.  His main complaint </p><p>is that he is only allowed to write in Nepali, which is not </p><p>his best language.  His outgoing letters are censored. </p><p>Nepali human rights activists had visited him in the jail, </p><p>including Sushil Pyakurel, a member of the Government,s </p><p>Human Rights Commission.  Pradhan has access to a jail </p><p>library, including works on Nepali law, and to </p><p>English-language newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>Sees Shortcomings in Legal System </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>7. (C) Having read up on Nepal\'s legal system while in jail, </p><p>Pradhan claimed to have found problems with both Nepal\'s </p><p>criminal procedures and civil law.  Under the civil law, </p><p>Pradhan said, an alien can be arrested on a simple charge, </p><p>without evidence, and be imprisoned until trial.  Pre-trial </p><p>investigations can take years.  (Note:  Under Nepali law </p><p>aliens are not eligible for bail.)  He added that he had not </p><p>been afforded due process.  He had no opportunities to </p><p>examine the evidence against him or even to ask a judge for </p><p>permission to see it.  During the hearings on his case held </p><p>to date, he had not once been allowed to speak, he said.  In </p><p>fact, the only time he was allowed to state his case was </p><p>immediately after his arrest, when a police officer took his </p><p>statement. </p><p> </p><p>World Travelers Garner International Sympathy </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In recent years Pradhan has been a regular on the </p><p>international human rights circuit, including at UNCHR </p><p>sessions in Geneva.  Just before his arrest he attended the </p><p>World Conference Against Racism (WCAR) in Durban, South </p><p>Africa.  Previously a civil servant in Bhutan, Pradhan earned </p><p>an M.P.A. at Penn State and also studied in India and the </p><p>U.K.  Pradhan has been able to marshal his international </p><p>contacts in support of efforts to gain his release.  Members </p><p>of Nepal\'s elite and even government officials have voiced </p><p>disbelief that Pradhan was involved in the murder.  The Chief </p><p>District Officer for Jhapa stated that the murder of </p><p>Budathoki and subsequent prosecution of S.K. Pradhan "must be </p><p>a conspiracy carried out by the Bhutanese government." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Were Pradhan not a refugee, he would have been able to </p><p>walk free on bail soon after his arrest.  Nepali law does not </p><p>afford bail to foreigners.  Moreover, a convoluted and opaque </p><p>legal process has prevented Pradhan from responding to the </p><p>complaint against him in a timely and meaningful fashion. </p><p>Most Nepalis share Pradhan\'s despair about their courts\' </p><p>ability to dispense justice.  Even so, to some degree </p><p>Pradhan\'s predicament is also a result of the factionalism </p><p>that afflicts Nepali society.  The politics of the Bhutanese </p><p>refugee camps - where nearly all the residents are ethnic </p><p>Nepali - mirror those of Nepal itself, and Pradhan has </p><p>apparently been the victim of another faction\'s desire to </p><p>pull him down a notch. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
