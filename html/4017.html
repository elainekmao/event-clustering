Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The governing United National Party is </p><p>being buffeted by severe turbulence triggered by unhappy </p><p>junior coalition partners.  The Sri Lanka Muslim </p><p>Congress is sharply divided over the peace process, for </p><p>example, while the major party for tea estate Tamils is </p><p>driving a hard bargain for its continued support. </p><p>Already on the defensive in its cohabitation battles </p><p>with the president, the coalition\'s widening fissures </p><p>are steadily undermining the effectiveness of the </p><p>government.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>UNP:  A problem with the Numbers </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The governing United National Party (UNP) is </p><p>experiencing serious problems with its junior partners. </p><p>(Note:  The UNP, in league with other smaller parties, </p><p>makes up the United National Front, "UNF," governing </p><p>coalition.)  While the largest single party in </p><p>Parliament with roughly 105 seats, the UNP is several </p><p>seats short of the 113 seats or more that are needed in </p><p>the 225-member Parliament for majority status.  This </p><p>fact makes the UNP reliant on the support of its UNF </p><p>partners, including the five seats held by the Sri Lanka </p><p>Muslim Congress (SLMC) and the three seats held by the </p><p>tea estate Tamil Ceylon Workers Congress, in forming the </p><p>UNF\'s current 114 seat majority.  (Note:  The numbers of </p><p>seats provided are best estimates:  some MPs run on </p><p>several party tickets, leading to various figures for </p><p>the total number of SLMC and tea estate Tamil MPs.) </p><p>Reflecting on the UNP\'s quandary, Desmond Fernando, a </p><p>well-known lawyer, recently told us -- "The government </p><p>is really at the mercy of the SLMC and the tea estate </p><p>Tamils for its majority." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Fractures in Key Muslim Party </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Of the UNP\'s coalition-related problems, the </p><p>most serious is with the SLMC, the major Muslim party in </p><p>the country.  Simply put, the SLMC seems to be gradually </p><p>breaking apart.  The main fault line in the party is </p><p>between those who support the GSL\'s peace initiative </p><p>versus those who are against it.  While this division </p><p>has been there since the UNF governing coalition was </p><p>formed in December 2001, the problem is only getting </p><p>worse -- and more public. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The central player in the intra-SLMC conflict is </p><p>the party\'s leader, Rauf Hakeem.  Most observers have </p><p>noted that Hakeem has been flat-out unable to unite all </p><p>elements of the SLMC in support of his pro-peace process </p><p>stance.  In particular, SLMC MPs (and party faithful) </p><p>who are from the tense eastern area are up in arms over </p><p>what they see as Hakeem\'s failure to protect them from </p><p>the Tamil Tigers.  SLMC members from the east note that </p><p>Hakeem is not from the east and accuse him of not caring </p><p>about their problems.  (Note:  Hakeem is from Kandy in </p><p>central Sri Lanka.)  In making this latter charge, they </p><p>note that Hakeem recently made a statement indicating </p><p>that he did not support the idea of forming a separate </p><p>Muslim administrative unit in the east, a proposal </p><p>favored by many eastern Muslims.  (Note:  After a furor </p><p>erupted over his remarks, Hakeem later backed down -- </p><p>see Reftel.)  Summarizing the SLMC problem, P. </p><p>Saravanamuttu, the head of a local think-tank, told us </p><p>that there had been a failure of leadership by Hakeem </p><p>and there was little sign that he would ever be able to </p><p>bring the eastern Muslims with him. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Aside from the issue of the peace process, there </p><p>appear to be additional reasons for the split in the </p><p>SLMC.  Milinda Moragoda, the Minister of Economic Reform </p><p>and a key adviser to the prime minister, told us that </p><p>many in the SLMC were upset with Hakeem over the way he </p><p>was handling government "pork."  Moragoda said he had </p><p>heard complaints that Hakeem was distributing goodies he </p><p>had obtained as minister of ports and shipping to his </p><p>supporters, and not to others within the party.  This </p><p>was causing serious heartburn to many and contributing </p><p>to Hakeem\'s inability to control all elements of the </p><p>party. </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Tea Estate Tamils at odds with the GSL </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The UNP is also at odds with Sri Lanka\'s major </p><p>party for tea estate Tamils, the CWC.  While the CWC is </p><p>strongly in favor of the GSL\'s peace initiative, </p><p>friction has emerged over the government\'s plans to move </p><p>forward with the "Upper Kotmale Dam" project.  (Note: </p><p>The project involves building a Japanese-funded dam in </p><p>the hill country of central Sri Lanka.)  Karu </p><p>Jayasuriya, the Minister for Power and the UNP\'s deputy </p><p>leader, has underscored that the project is crucial for </p><p>meeting Sri Lanka\'s electricity-generating needs, an </p><p>assessment most neutral observers agree with. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) A. Thondaman, the chief of the CWC and the </p><p>Minister for Housing, has angrily attacked the </p><p>government\'s plans, however.  Thondaman has repeatedly </p><p>spilled harsh words, asserting that the project will </p><p>lead to serious environmental degradation and the loss </p><p>of jobs for tea estate Tamils.  He has even threatened </p><p>to bolt the government over the issue, if necessary, and </p><p>has been deftly campaigning against the project with </p><p>important groups outside of his own tea estate Tamil </p><p>community.  Thondaman, for example, recently gained the </p><p>support of the chief of the important Malwatte sect of </p><p>the Buddhist clergy to his anti-dam cause. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Despite the heat it has been taking, the GSL has </p><p>indicated that it plans to go forward with the Kotmale </p><p>project.  Jayasuriya, for one, has taken pains to assure </p><p>Thondaman that the government will do its best to </p><p>address all environmental and economic concerns.  The </p><p>GSL\'s efforts seem to be working inasmuch as Thondaman </p><p>lately seems to be less testy on the subject than in the </p><p>immediate past.  Nonetheless, there is a feeling that </p><p>Thondaman will continue to be a thorn in the </p><p>government\'s side.  Making this point, Jehan Perera, the </p><p>head of the National Peace Council, a local NGO, told us </p><p>that "He (Thondaman) knows that the UNP needs him and he </p><p>will press the government for as much in return as he </p><p>possibly can get whenever he can." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) As reviewed in Reftel, the government is already </p><p>on the defensive in its cohabitation battles with the </p><p>president.  The fact that the governing coalition itself </p><p>is coming under increasing centrifugal pressure has </p><p>further hindered its effectiveness vis-a-vis the </p><p>president, as well as hurting it as it grapples with </p><p>other pressing issues.  That said, the fragility of the </p><p>UNP\'s governing coalition does not mean the government </p><p>is close to falling, as the UNP in extremis can count on </p><p>the support of the MPs affiliated with the Tamil parties </p><p>for now.  Down the road, however, as the GSL deals with </p><p>ever more sensitive issues involving peace and the </p><p>economy, fractures in the coalition may only widen. </p><p>Among many in the UNP, the coalition and cohabitation </p><p>problems are of such magnitude that the PM may well be </p><p>moved to try to call an election sooner rather than </p><p>later.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
