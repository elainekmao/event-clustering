<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001102 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/FO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MARR, EAID, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) IRAQI OPPOSITIONISTS AND RECONSTRUCTION; </p><p>MINSTATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS RAISES WAR ISSUES WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  On March 24, during an introductory call for </p><p>Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) </p><p>Director, Gen. Jay Garner, he and the Ambassador discussed </p><p>war-related issues with Minstate for Foreign Affairs Shaykh </p><p>Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah .  Among the items raised were ORHA\'s </p><p>structure and mission, the inclusion of Iraqi oppositionists </p><p>in war efforts and Kuwait\'s efforts to begin providing </p><p>humanitarian assistance.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>ORHA </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Dr. Mohammed was very interested in the structure and </p><p>mission of ORHA, and asked Gen. Garner if ORHA would wait </p><p>until securing Baghdad to begin its operations.  He also </p><p>asked for Gen. Garner\'s assessment of the humanitarian </p><p>situation in Iraq, and inquired as to how ORHA would </p><p>distribute humanitarian goods.  Gen. Garner explained that he </p><p>reported to CENTCOM Commander Gen. Franks and SecDef </p><p>Rumsfeld.  He said ORHA has plans to place teams in every </p><p>city with a population over 100,000, and would do so as soon </p><p>as the security situation permitted.  The teams, which are </p><p>composed mainly of civilians, are hoping to distribute </p><p>humanitarian assistance via the already existing Oil For Food </p><p>(OFF) distribution mechanisms.  Gen. Garner said the UNSC </p><p>Resolution currently in the works is aimed at continuing the </p><p>OFF program.  The UK and US are working directly with the </p><p>UNSYG in an attempt to get the resolution introduced over </p><p>French and Russian objections.  Although the humanitarian </p><p>situation has not been as bad as had been expected, he said, </p><p>aid distribution will be ORHA\'s first priority in Iraq.  If </p><p>the situation deteriorates further, Gen. Garner said ORHA </p><p>will look at all options for aid distribution, including </p><p>airdrops. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Dr. Mohammed also asked Gen. Garner about the current </p><p>status of oil fires in Iraq.  Garner explained that the Army </p><p>Corps of Engineers, along with Kuwaiti firefighters and </p><p>civilians contracted through ORHA, would be putting out the </p><p>oil fires near Basra.  The Ambassador confirmed that the U.S. </p><p>has no solid evidence that wells in Kirkuk were ever blown. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>IRAQI OPPOSITION GROUPS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Minister also raised concerns that the U.S. may </p><p>not be making a sufficient effort to fully inform the Iraqi </p><p>people of its goals.  He said there seemed to be "ambiguity" </p><p>amongst the Iraqis, and asked if we were broadcasting our </p><p>message into Iraq alongside our forces.  Gen. Garner </p><p>confirmed that multiple efforts are being made to ensure the </p><p>Iraqi people are fully aware of U.S. reconstruction plans, </p><p>including leaflet drops and radio broadcasts.  In addition, </p><p>he said, ORHA teams will be increasing radio broadcasts as </p><p>soon as they enter Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Building on this concern, the Minister suggested the </p><p>U.S. avail itself of Iraqi oppositionists to help spread the </p><p>U.S. message inside Iraq.  He said that the Shiite Supreme </p><p>Council for the Islamic Revolutionin Iraq (SCIRI), in </p><p>particular, had been complaining to the GOK that they had </p><p>been "sidelined."  "The time for fighting back" against Iraqi </p><p>propaganda was now, he said, and suggested that the US </p><p>utilize SCIRI to do so, especially in the south.  "Most of </p><p>the fighting back should be carried out by Iraqis," he said. </p><p>"You need to choose the right instruments to accomplish your </p><p>goals." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>KUWAIT\'S CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Confirming an announcement that had been made in the </p><p>press earlier in the week, Dr. Mohammed said Kuwait had begun </p><p>treating Iraqis injured in the fighting at Umm Qasr in a </p><p>field hospital it had set up on the Kuwaiti side of the </p><p>border at UNIKOM\'s old HQ at Camp Khor.  In addition, Kuwait </p><p>has already provided humanitarian aid, which has been loaded </p><p>onto a ship waiting to enter Iraq at Umm Qasr.  Dr. Mohammed </p><p>said Kuwait is interested in publicizing its efforts, and </p><p>indicated he would appreciate it if the Ambassador and Gen. </p><p>Garner kept Kuwait in mind should opportunities for publicity </p><p>arise. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Gen. Garner has not cleared this message. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
