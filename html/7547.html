<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000720 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - J. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KCRM, EFIN, ECON, PINS, PTER, PHUM, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POLICY CONSIDERATIONS IN THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. The April 19 election will test the </p><p>tensile strength of Nigerian democracy and its </p><p>supporting institutions.  While many will play </p><p>important roles in this national drama, the primary </p><p>antagonists are President Obasanjo and Muhammed </p><p>Buhari.  Not only is this election a litmus test of </p><p>democratic consolidation in Nigeria, it also could </p><p>spell substantive policy differences on issues key to </p><p>the bilateral agenda.  Obasanjo and Buhari differ on </p><p>economic reform, i.e. privatization, poverty </p><p>reduction, and working with the IFI\'s. Both would </p><p>fight corruption and drug-trafficking but their </p><p>priorities and approaches would be dissimilar.  Both </p><p>would want to maintain our strong security assistance </p><p>relationship, but Obasanjo would be more aggressive. </p><p>Human rights might be better protected under the </p><p>President, and our anti-corruption efforts might bear </p><p>more fruit under Buhari.  In the end, we could deal </p><p>effectively with either man; the bilateral </p><p>relationship would just vary in areas of accord and </p><p>disagreement.  History suggests that Obasanjo, </p><p>however, would be more predictable and proactive in </p><p>seeking a good relationship. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>DEMOCRACY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Twice Nigeria has attempted a civilian-to- </p><p>civilian transition through elections; twice it has </p><p>failed.  Each time a flawed electoral process was </p><p>followed by successful coups.  The quality of the </p><p>April 19 Presidential election and its resultant </p><p>aftermath will determine if democracy has been </p><p>solidified or put in great peril.  Right now, the </p><p>signs are not good; dark clouds are gathering, </p><p>portending a storm of controversy, with possible </p><p>unrest and violence in many areas of the country.  The </p><p>possible saving grace this time is that there is no </p><p>sign the military is particularly interested in </p><p>executing a coup now or in the near future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The allegations of massive vote manipulation by </p><p>the opposition have cast a pall over the elections and </p><p>could bring into question the legitimacy of the winner </p><p>and his government.  The opposition has alleged that </p><p>the fraud committed on April 12 exceeds the </p><p>malpractices of 1999 and harkens to the failed </p><p>elections of 1983.  Compounding the historic </p><p>connection to 1983 is the fact that President Obasanjo </p><p>was the military leader who handed power to the </p><p>civilian government that conducted the 1883 elections; </p><p>Buhari was a military leader who engineered the coup </p><p>terminating that government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In an April 16 press statement, Buhari </p><p>explicitly drew the parallel to 1983, exhorting </p><p>supporters to take "mass action" if the Presidential </p><p>election repeated the systemic fraud that afflicted </p><p>the April 12 contests.  (Comment:  Buhari\'s call for </p><p>mass action was purposely vague as to exactly what </p><p>steps he will ask his followers to take in the </p><p>eventuality of another controversial vote count. </p><p>While vague, the threat was not veiled.  Buhari </p><p>basically has told his followers to be ready to grind </p><p>the country to a halt if the election is manipulated. </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Much of the criticism of the April 12 election </p><p>appears warranted; unfortunately, these irregularities </p><p>will likely reappear on April 19.  There probably has </p><p>been significant vote manipulation in many areas. </p><p>Unlike 1999 when all three parties fixed the voting in </p><p>areas within their spheres of influence, most credible </p><p>allegations this time are being levied against the </p><p>ruling PDP.  While 1999 may have been a "fair cheat", </p><p>this time the wrongdoing seems heavily dominated by </p><p>only one party, the PDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The irregularities surrounding the elections </p><p>are too significant to ignore.  We expect both </p><p>international and domestic observers to be critical. </p><p>We also have to be prepared to make a statement that </p><p>may not set comfortably with the putative winner, </p><p>Obasanjo.  While we may not reach the point of calling </p><p>the entire outcome into question, any public USG </p><p>statement must point out the obvious deficiencies and </p><p>point fingers at those who were responsible.  Given </p><p>the contested nature of the elections, we also must </p><p>call on the eventual victor to reach out to the </p><p>vanquished to strengthen an otherwise controversial </p><p>and defective mandate by keeping them involved in the </p><p>governance process in a meaningful, if informal, way. </p><p>A call for national consensus and unity on the way </p><p>forward has to be a part of our message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Overall, Obasanjo is more inclined to free </p><p>market, private sector oriented reform than Buhari. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s present term started promisingly, but </p><p>toward the end, the drive toward reform gave way to </p><p>backward steps toward protectionist tariffs. Whether </p><p>Obasanjo would be a plodding, imperfect reformer or a </p><p>dedicated one will be revealed by his political </p><p>appointments. If he returns many of the same Ministers </p><p>and senior officials, reform will be little more than </p><p>a shibboleth. Should he bring out the broom and sweep </p><p>his Cabinet to make room for a cadre of young </p><p>technocrats, meaningful reform has a chance.  We would </p><p>also have to watch the behavior of Vice President </p><p>Atiku.  Not only does Atiku promise to be actively </p><p>involved in the domestic agenda, he will try to steer </p><p>policy and decisions to maximize his electoral chances </p><p>in 2007. This could throttle reform, particularly in </p><p>the last half of the term.  Atiku simply does not show </p><p>the same reformist impulse exhibited by Obasanjo. </p><p>Meanwhile, Buhari will be a perfect reformer; the </p><p>unfortunate thing is that at least some of his reforms </p><p>will likely be retrograde.  He is at heart a statist </p><p>and wary of the free market and foreign investment. He </p><p>deplores the IFI\'s. However, he recently has exhibited </p><p>willingness to consider privatization\'s merits.  While </p><p>Obasanjo is a dedicated micro-manager of economic and </p><p>other issues, Buhari is likely to delegate heavily, </p><p>and many of his advisors share his statist tendencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Privatization: This has been one of Obasanjo\'s </p><p>accomplishments and he will likely accelerate the </p><p>pace.  Conversely, Buhari believes that privatization </p><p>will  surrender Nigeria\'s assets to predatory </p><p>foreigners and already affluent Nigerians who gained </p><p>their wealth dishonestly. For him, privatization is a </p><p>scam to make the rich guys richer. His policy would be </p><p>to retain many of the parastatals and make them work </p><p>better by instilling discipline, fighting corruption, </p><p>and making them more efficient.  He would likely halt </p><p>the ongoing privatization of the national power </p><p>company, NEPA.  The opportunity costs of keeping </p><p>inefficient, non-performing alive, would probably not </p><p>be apparent to Buhari, much less deter him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Relations with the IFIs: Obasanjo does not like </p><p>the IFIs but knows that he must work with them.  If </p><p>elected, he would resume a formal arrangement with the </p><p>IMF, for example. On the other hand, Buhari had a </p><p>confrontational relationship with the IFIs as a </p><p>military leader and he is prepared to resume that same </p><p>dissonance as the elected Head of State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>CONFLICT RESOLUTION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) This is President Obasanjo\'s ken. During this </p><p>election period, he took a leave from active </p><p>leadership in West African and regional statesmanship, </p><p>except for intermittent forays into the Zimbabwean and </p><p>Ivoirien crises. Freed of the constraints imposed by </p><p>the elections, we would expect Obasanjo to resume a </p><p>high level of engagement; more importantly, we could </p><p>expect a good degree of cooperation and harmony of </p><p>views, with the exceptions of Zimbabwe and single- </p><p>country resolutions in international fora.  We also </p><p>would expect Obasanjo to do more in Liberia, and exert </p><p>more pressure to bring Taylor made control.  We could </p><p>even engage with him in ways of getting the rascal </p><p>out.  Nigerian foreign policy would remain Africa- </p><p>centric, and Obasanjo would try to give a greater push </p><p>to West Africa integration. Buhari is not equally </p><p>interested in regional affairs. He has told us Nigeria </p><p>should not be involved in Cote d\'Ivoire and he would </p><p>oppose sending peacekeepers. While Obasanjo hardly </p><p>needs a fillip, Buhari would have to be vigorously </p><p>courted to engage actively in regional affairs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>NEPAD </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) This is Obasanjo\'s brainchild and he will </p><p>continue to be one of its prime movers, particularly </p><p>on the peer review mechanism. Buhari probably has no </p><p>affection for this endeavor. First, it bears </p><p>Obasanjo\'s stamp. Second, the no-nonsense, old- </p><p>fashioned Buhari would likely dismiss NEPAD as some </p><p>vague, pie-in-the-sky construct that will yield little </p><p>practical results.  Relations with South Africa and </p><p>Senegal would progressively cool. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CORRUPTION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  Both men would fight corruption.  Obasanjo </p><p>would continue to use the Anti-Corruption Commission </p><p>(ICPC) as his spearhead. However, his efforts will be </p><p>diluted if he retains many of his current Ministers </p><p>and advisors.  If so, he risks losing the battle on </p><p>corruption to the extent that his second term might </p><p>become the Nigerian equivalent of President Grant\'s </p><p>venal second Administration during America\'s Gilded </p><p>Age. Buhari would likely initiate a no-holds-barred </p><p>battle against corruption. He would not rely on the </p><p>Anti-corruption Commission as presently constituted, </p><p>if at all. He would use existing bodies (such as the </p><p>Code of Conduct Bureau) and the police and other </p><p>security agencies more than the ICPC.  There have been </p><p>frequent public allegations that Obasanjo and the </p><p>Presidency have used the ICPC as a political tool. </p><p>These allegations may be untrue, but they have damaged </p><p>the ICPC in the eyes of many in the opposition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>NARCOTICS TRAFFIC AND MIL-TO-MIL RELATIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Both men would fight narcotics trafficking. </p><p>Judging by his past record, Buhari would be much more </p><p>aggressive than Obasanjo has been.  He might beef up </p><p>the NOLEA and aggressively go after major traffickers. </p><p>More would be done to combat advance-fee and other "4- </p><p>1-9" fraud, and harsh penalties would be levied. </p><p>However, we would expect Buhari to be cool toward </p><p>extraditions.  On military-to-military relations, </p><p>Buhari would be less aggressive in deepening ties to </p><p>Western states.  More of Nigeria\'s resources would be </p><p>devoted to military preparedness.  Buhari might be </p><p>more belligerent on Bakassi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Obasanjo has a relatively good human rights </p><p>record with the clear exception of the Zaki Biam and </p><p>Odi massacres. He has been good on the protection of </p><p>political and civil liberties. An Obasanjo </p><p>Administration will be expected to continue to improve </p><p>its human rights stand on most fronts. Buhari is an </p><p>unknown quantity.  His past term as a military leader </p><p>was associated with numerous abuses such as draconian </p><p>prison sentences, executions, and media intolerance. </p><p>We do not expect him to be as ruthless as before but </p><p>he will likely be less sensitive to human rights </p><p>concerns than Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SHARI\'A </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Obasanjo opposes strict Shari\'a punishments. </p><p>He would like a test case to make it to federal court </p><p>so that the GON could participate in the deliberations </p><p>as a friend of the court.  His objective would be a </p><p>ruling that declares harsh Shari\'a punishments, such </p><p>as stoning sentences for adultery, unconstitutionally </p><p>cruel and unusual. While Buhari\'s supports Shari\'a, we </p><p>do not know his stance on the application of </p><p>particular punishments like stoning. Most likely, </p><p>Buhari would rather not see a case advance to the </p><p>federal courts, out of concern that an adverse verdict </p><p>could basically gut Shari\'a.  Instead, he would </p><p>probably prefer that the states be left to handle </p><p>these affairs according to their individual Shari\'a </p><p>codes.  He might not object to the imposition of the </p><p>harshest sentences but discourage governors from </p><p>allowing them to be carried out.   Unlike Obasanjo, he </p><p>would not "weep" for Nigeria if Shari\'a sentences were </p><p>carried out.  On the other hand, Buhari, unlike </p><p>Obasanjo, would have clout with Northern Governors and </p><p>religious leaders on the Shari\'a issue, if he chose to </p><p>intervene. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) We know Obasanjo better than we know Buhari; </p><p>however, familiarity should not affect our objectivity </p><p>in analyzing the policies and our potential </p><p>relationship with either of the two men, one of whom </p><p>will be Nigeria\'s next President.  Obasanjo is pro- </p><p>West and pro-America; however, we have had </p><p>difficulties and significant disagreements with him. </p><p>Buhari may not look to the West or America as much as </p><p>Obasanjo; but he has not been antagonistic.  He </p><p>appears to want a good bilateral relationship and has </p><p>been accessible to American diplomats.  However, the </p><p>relationship might show different areas of potential </p><p>cooperation and different areas of disagreement than </p><p>under Obasanjo. For instance, Obasanjo might be a </p><p>fellow traveler when it comes to regional conflict </p><p>resolution; Buhari may be exemplary against </p><p>corruption.  During his previous incarnations as Head </p><p>of State, then President Zia was the first Head of </p><p>State received by Buhari in Nigeria.  Buhari would </p><p>seek greater ties with the Muslim world, and would be </p><p>pro-Arab on issues dealing with the Middle East. </p><p>Differences of religion may become more prominent in </p><p>Nigerian politics, no matter the winner of the </p><p>Presidential race. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) In the end, Obasanjo may be more reformist on </p><p>more issues, but he is a flawed reformer who has thus </p><p>far lacked the necessary focus and political will to </p><p>prioritize and completely implement important </p><p>structural reforms. Conversely, Buhari has the </p><p>reputation of doing what he says he will do.  Buhari </p><p>will be a person dedicated to making trains run on </p><p>time, in part, by running fewer of them. With either </p><p>leader, we would have to quickly engage with him after </p><p>the election to identify how we can best advance areas </p><p>of agreement and best manage our differences. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
