In other political </p><p>developments:  President Kumaratunga continues to work </p><p>toward forming an alliance with the radical JVP party </p><p>and there are reports that she may call elections in the </p><p>provinces soon to test GSL support.  Despite the </p><p>Opposition\'s best efforts, however, the government </p><p>appears to be in a relatively solid position at this </p><p>time.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>A Comfortable Win for the GSL </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The United National Front (UNF) governing </p><p>coalition headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe </p><p>won a February 18 no-confidence vote with ease.  The </p><p>vote in Parliament was 126-84 in favor of the </p><p>government.  (Note:  Parliament has 225 members, with </p><p>113 votes needed for a majority.  Fourteen members were </p><p>absent from the February 18 vote and the Speaker, per </p><p>tradition, did not vote.)  In addition to the support of </p><p>United National Party (UNP) MP\'s, all of the parties in </p><p>the governing coalition voted with the UNF, including </p><p>the tea estate Ceylon Worker\'s Congress (CWC) and the </p><p>Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC).  The UNF also enjoyed </p><p>the support of MP\'s from the Tamil National Alliance </p><p>(TNA), a grouping that is not technically part of the </p><p>governing coalition, but tends to vote with it. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In winning the February 18 motion by a margin of </p><p>42 votes, the government actually increased its margin </p><p>of victory from the last no-confidence motion held in </p><p>August 2002.  In that vote, the government won by </p><p>127-92, a margin of 35 seats. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>PA-JVP Talks Continue </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The setback in Parliament was bad news for the </p><p>Opposition.  Working together, President Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>People\'s Alliance (PA) party and the radical Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party had moved the no- </p><p>confidence motion on the basis that Defense Minister </p><p>Tilak Marapana was mismanaging the security forces.  In </p><p>doing so, PA and JVP MP\'s took the floor of Parliament </p><p>on February 18 spouting hot invective toward the GSL\'s </p><p>peace initiative, charging that the government was </p><p>letting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) push </p><p>it around.  The effort clearly did not work:  the PA/JVP </p><p>failed to wrench away any governing coalition partners, </p><p>including the SLMC, despite the fact that the Muslim </p><p>party has been lukewarm toward the peace process.  In </p><p>addition, according to contacts, PA/JVP anti-peace </p><p>process comments pushed the Tamil parties to vote with </p><p>the GSL, overcoming any TNA doubts about the government </p><p>sparked by recent tensions in the north and east </p><p>(see Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Despite the defeat, there is every indication </p><p>that President Kumaratunga will continue to work with </p><p>the JVP toward forming an alliance.  In the past several </p><p>weeks, a number of meetings have been held between Sri </p><p>Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and JVP leaders.  (Note:  The </p><p>SLFP is the primary constituent element of the PA.)  The </p><p>two sides have reportedly been working on a document </p><p>outlining a political program for a PA/JVP alliance.  In </p><p>a February 18 press report, Anura Bandaranaike, a senior </p><p>PA MP and the president\'s brother, asserted that the </p><p>alliance could be finalized and announced in the March </p><p>timeframe.  Queried about these reports, M.L.A.M. </p><p>Hizbullah, a Muslim MP aligned with the PA, told us that </p><p>the president has not yet briefed PA members about the </p><p>possibility of an alliance and he did not think any such </p><p>grouping would be finalized soon.  (Note:  In a late </p><p>January conversation with the Ambassador, Ronnie De Mel, </p><p>a senior PA MP, also downplayed talk of a PA/JVP linkup </p><p>-- see Ref B.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) (((Note:  In a recent press interview, Lakshman </p><p>Kadirgamar, a former Foreign Minister who is close to </p><p>Kumaratunga, was quoted as confirming that the PA was </p><p>working closely with the JVP, stating:  "These alliances </p><p>are taking place all the time.  All governments do this. </p><p>All oppositions do that...In that context, the JVP and </p><p>the SLFP are talking, seeking to overthrow the </p><p>government in a legitimate parliamentary exercise. </p><p>Obviously, the bottom line is no violence."))) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) (((Note:  In other news involving cohabitation: </p><p>the president\'s office publicly released a letter that </p><p>Kumaratunga sent to the PM last week.  The letter hit </p><p>out at the Prime Minister for allegedly hiring Japanese </p><p>Special Envoy Akashi to be an "international adviser" </p><p>for the government.  The letter asserted that this </p><p>supposed action was contrary to Sri Lanka\'s sovereignty. </p><p>The letter also criticized Milinda Moragoda, a key </p><p>minister and associate of the PM, for allegedly being a </p><p>U.S. puppet based on some of his recent comments.  In </p><p>our estimation, the charge re the GSL and Akashi is </p><p>baseless, and that involving Moragoda a canard.  End </p><p>Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Provincial Elections Soon? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Reports that the president might choose to call </p><p>new parliamentary elections soon have diminished in the </p><p>past several weeks.  The general feeling is that the PA </p><p>does not want early national elections in the near-term </p><p>because it would probably lose seats.  At this time, </p><p>however, it seems possible that the president may call </p><p>elections in the provinces soon to test GSL support. </p><p>(Note:  Provincial elections are due to take place next </p><p>year, but the president can call them earlier.)  The PA </p><p>controls most of the provincial councils and there has </p><p>been some talk that Kumaratunga might call elections in </p><p>some areas where she thinks her party may be strong, </p><p>such as the Southern Province.  (Note:  The PA has </p><p>traditionally been quite strong in the mainly Sinhalese </p><p>Buddhist south of the country.  The PA, however, seems </p><p>disorganized in the Southern Province at this time, with </p><p>one of its leading MP\'s from the area recently </p><p>announcing that he would not support his party if </p><p>provincial elections were called.)  (Note:  Local </p><p>elections are also due in the north and east later this </p><p>year.  These elections were postponed last year due to </p><p>LTTE pressure.  The TNA would probably win most of the </p><p>races, with the UNP winning a handful.  The PA and JVP </p><p>are not major factors in the north and east.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The government appears to be in a relatively </p><p>solid position at this time.  Although the peace process </p><p>has hit a rough patch and there are economic problems, </p><p>the government still seems popular.  On the flip side, </p><p>despite its best efforts, the Opposition -- especially </p><p>the PA -- appears weak and virtually bereft of new </p><p>ideas.  It is hard to imagine how linking up with the </p><p>Sinhalese chauvinist JVP could help the PA. </p><p>(Note:  Most observers believe the PA did not benefit </p><p>from its late 2001 alliance with the JVP, for example.) </p><p>That said, Sri Lankan politics are notoriously fluid and </p><p>the government knows it cannot rest easy.  END COMMENT. </p><p>10. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
