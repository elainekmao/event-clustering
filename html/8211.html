<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001009 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND CWILKENSON </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS USAID FOR MAJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ECON, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Labor Strike Updates </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 135 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Public and private sector strikes are on the </p><p>rise.  Given the state of this free-falling economy, </p><p>however, it is doubtful many workers will come out ahead. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Public school teachers recently lost a court ruling and, </p><p>on instruction from the Zimbabwe Teachers\' Association </p><p>(ZIMTA), are returning to work.  They had been striking </p><p>since May 8, demanding a salary increase from Z$ 60,000 (US$ </p><p>29) to Z$ 268,000 (US$ 128)/month.  Workers at electricity </p><p>parastatal ZESA began striking on May 20, asking for 50 </p><p>percent across-the-board increases.  The GOZ recently met </p><p>most demands of striking Air Zimbabwe engineers, boasting </p><p>salaries about 300 percent to as high as Z$ 430,000 (US$ </p><p>205)/month (ref). </p><p> </p><p>3. There have also been assorted cases of private sector </p><p>labor unrest.  Most recently workers at Standard Bank </p><p>Zimbabwe have threatened to strike if management does not </p><p>meet demands for a 65 percent cost-of-living adjustment. </p><p>Many security companies, who generally pay guards less than </p><p>US$ 10/month, are also facing strikes.   Most multinationals </p><p>we speak with now readjust worker salaries each quarter. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. With inflation raging at 269 percent and the Zimdollar </p><p>having lost 84 percent of its value in a year, workers are </p><p>fighting a losing battle.  The GOZ considers indexing </p><p>salaries to hard currency or inflation a taboo topic.  In </p><p>U.S. dollar terms, salaries of the highest paid AirZim </p><p>engineers have already shrunk from $ 289 to 205 since the </p><p>GOZ caved in to union demands in January.  By the end of </p><p>2003, the engineers may be earning less than before the </p><p>strike began.  Still, given the plight of the Zimbabwean </p><p>worker, we expect growing numbers of public and private </p><p>sector strikes. </p><p> </p><p>5. The AirZim strike shows that the GOZ will meet worker </p><p>demands when it makes financial sense.  AirZim was paying </p><p>South African engineers US$ 55/hour to replace Zimbabwean </p><p>workers, so the GOZ had every reason to settle with workers </p><p>for any price in its monopoly-money currency.  Given the </p><p>sensitivity of electricity parastatal ZESA, local sources </p><p>believe chances are good the GOZ will cede to demands.  On </p><p>the other hand, since the GOZ considers many teachers </p><p>staunch Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) supporters, </p><p>labor sources believe the teachers will have more of an </p><p>uphill climb. </p><p> </p><p>Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
