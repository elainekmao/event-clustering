The paper expects Incirlik </p><p>air base to lose its importance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CFR\'s Ankara meetings: The Council on Foreign Relations </p><p>(CFR) paid a `meaningful\' visit to Turkey to examine the </p><p>`fault line\' in U.S.-Turkey relations.  The CFR delegation </p><p>is particularly interested in the `new\' direction of Turkish </p><p>foreign policy following the war in Iraq, according to </p><p>"Aksam."  The CFR wants to `understand\' Turkey\'s view of </p><p>Iran and Syria, and wants to evaluate Turkish-Israeli ties </p><p>as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Pearson on U.S.-Turkey relations: U.S. Ambassador </p><p>Robert Pearson told "Hurriyet" that the U.S. and Turkey, </p><p>having cooperated for 50 years, should now make a new </p><p>beginning.  `I have never lost hope in Turkey,\' Pearson </p><p>said, adding that bilateral ties have survived even greater </p><p>problems, which were not disclosed.  Pearson advised Ankara </p><p>to be open and balanced in relations with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Perle on Turkey: Pentagon advisor Richard Perle warned </p><p>Turkey that bilateral relations with the U.S. would suffer a </p><p>serious crisis if Ankara refuses to support American policy </p><p>regarding Iran and Syria.  Speaking at an American </p><p>Enterprise Institute (AEI) conference, Perle stressed that </p><p>bilateral ties are still strong despite the parliament\'s </p><p>refusal of the March 1 motion on foreign troop deployment in </p><p>Turkey.  Perle also said that Turkey\'s participation in the </p><p>international peacekeeping force in Iraq would contribute to </p><p>regional stability and help U.S.-Turkish cooperation as </p><p>well.  "Hurriyet" notes that Perle\'s warning comes on the </p><p>eve of Undersecretary Ziyal\'s trip to Washington on Sunday. </p><p>ANCA rejects Turkish call for dialog: The American National </p><p>Council of Armenians (ANCA) rejected the Turkish </p><p>government\'s call for a direct dialogue, saying that Ankara </p><p>must first recognize the Armenian genocide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gul, military on EU reforms package: Foreign Minister Gul </p><p>called on TGS Chief General Ozkok on Monday to discuss the </p><p>EU reform package, dailies report.  Papers believe that the </p><p>government and TGS have worked out a compromise on the </p><p>package which Gul said will be submitted to parliament on </p><p>Tuesday for approval without waiting for the monthly NSC </p><p>meeting on June 26.  `The EU adjustment package will prove </p><p>that Muslim countries can also apply democracy, pluralism, </p><p>modernity, and transparency," Gul said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:   Iraq and US-Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US-Turkey Route" </p><p>Fatih Cekirge observed in the tabloid Star (6/10): "Ankara </p><p>is paying the consequences of its misguided policies. </p><p>Despite warnings from the US, Turkey signed trade agreements </p><p>with Saddam before the war, and today all of these deals </p><p>have tied Ankara\'s hands.  The Kurdish leaders Barzani and </p><p>Talabani are no longer taking messages from Turkey </p><p>seriously.  .By keeping its distance from the US, Ankara </p><p>indirectly encouraged Washington and the northern Iraqi </p><p>leaders to enhance their cooperation.  This cooperation is </p><p>now strong enough to lead to the formation of a federal </p><p>Kurdish state. . Given these facts, Ankara is trying to make </p><p>things up with Washington.  Yet it does not seem likely that </p><p>bilateral visits will be able to normalize the relationship. </p><p>The US seems unable to forget about its disappointment with </p><p>respect to Ankara.  Turkey should be prepared for some </p><p>diplomatic and economic pain due to the ongoing tension on </p><p>the Ankara-Washington route." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"In Washington the wounds are still open" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in mass appeal-sensational Posta </p><p>(6/10): "Has the AKP government managed to draw up its basic </p><p>itinerary?  What kind of route will that be? Islamist or pro- </p><p>third world?  Or a route that would be similar to that of </p><p>Washington?  In Washington too, these questions are being </p><p>asked.  Washington is looking forward to the messages MFA </p><p>Undersecretary Ugur Ziyal will be bringing when he arrives </p><p>next week.  Ziyal has a difficult task.  He will be in the </p><p>limelight.  When a trip takes place in the limelight amid </p><p>great expectations, the danger that it will lead to </p><p>disappointment is enhanced.  There are certain words the US </p><p>administration wants to hear in the short run.   Pentagon </p><p>officials say that the ball is in Ankara\'s court.  The Turks </p><p>will play by telling the US where they want to go and how </p><p>they will get there." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
