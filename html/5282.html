<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000189 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PINR, KJUS, GT, UN, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND PRESS MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON GOG FOR </p><p>PROPOSAL TO INVESTIGATE CLANDESTINE GROUPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 146 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 171 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Katharine Read, HROff, for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: In the days following the Human Rights </p><p>Ombudsman\'s public presentation of the proposal for a UN-OAS </p><p>led commission to investigate clandestine groups (Ref A)), </p><p>the media has followed up with domestic editorials and </p><p>international endorsements of the idea.  The Ambassador has </p><p>continued to solicit support from the GOG, in both his </p><p>January 17 meeting with Foreign Minister Gutierrez, and his </p><p>January 21 meeting with Finance Minister Weymann (Ref B). </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Leading dailies Siglo Veintiuno and El Periodico </p><p>covered the statements made by the Ambassador, the Canadian </p><p>Ambassador, Amnesty International London, and local NGOs in </p><p>support of the proposal.  Siglo Veintiuno directly quoted the </p><p>Ambassador\'s statement of, "It appears to me to be a very </p><p>good initiative and very well thought-out.  The Commission </p><p>can make a contribution to the strengthening of democracy and </p><p>I hope the Government supports it, because I think it is </p><p>something positive."  The Canadian Ambassador and Amnesty </p><p>International reportedly echoed the Ambassador\'s sentiment </p><p>and urged the GOG to support the Commission. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In a January 20 signed editorial in El Periodico, </p><p>human rights activist Miguel Angel Albizures wrote about the </p><p>hold which clandestine groups exercise over the civilian </p><p>government.  Albizures acknowledged that clandestine groups </p><p>were a pre-FRG phenomenon, but that the situation has </p><p>deteriorated during the Portillo administration, despite </p><p>Portillo\'s campaign promises to end the insecurity and </p><p>delinquency affecting Guatemalans.  Albizures reiterated the </p><p>human rights community sentiment that \'enough is enough\' and </p><p>urged the GOG to "open its eyes, even though it is in the </p><p>final stretch of its disastrous governance."  He said that </p><p>this proposal would "test Portillo\'s political will, because </p><p>it is the President who must ask the UN and OAS for this </p><p>Commission." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In a January 17 meeting called by Foreign Minister </p><p>Gutierrez to discuss counter-narcotics efforts, the </p><p>Ambassador reiterated his support of the proposal to </p><p>Gutierrez and Ministers of Defense and Interior.  The </p><p>Ambassador urged the GOG to give the proposal its full </p><p>support and said that this would be a credible way in which </p><p>they could demonstrate their commitment to reform.  Gutierrez </p><p>agreed that the presence of clandestine groups was alarming </p><p>and said that he came to similar conclusions during his time </p><p>at the SAE, when he produced a report on clandestine groups. </p><p>However, Gutierrez mentioned that he believed any </p><p>investigation should be geared towards a fact-finding </p><p>exposition rather than an evidence-gathering prosecution. </p><p>Gutierrez also spoke (vaguely) of the need to move ahead "at </p><p>the right political moment."  The Ambassador responded that </p><p>there was no better moment than the present. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On January 21, the Ambassador spoke with Finance </p><p>Minister Eduardo Weymann, an FRG inner circle member, about </p><p>human rights, CAFTA, and counternarcotics efforts.  He said </p><p>that the USG was giving the proposal firm public support and </p><p>suggested it would behoove the GOG to back the effort to </p><p>establish a commission to investigate clandestine groups. </p><p>Weymann responded that Vice President Reyes would lead the </p><p>FRG\'s policy on the proposal and that Reyes was already in </p><p>contact with Helen Mack about this and other threats against </p><p>human rights workers. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Also on January 21, Congress passed a resolution </p><p>proposed by opposition congresswoman Nineth Montenegro to </p><p>urge Portillo to accept the proposal to investigate </p><p>clandestine groups.  The resolution passed with the support </p><p>of 90 deputies, including members of the FRG.  In response to </p><p>public and private pressure for executive action, Portillo </p><p>and Gutierrez announced on January 22 that they had invited </p><p>Human Rights Watch Director Jose Miguel Vivanco to facilitate </p><p>the discussion between the Ombudsman, human rights NGOs, and </p><p>the GOG on the mandate of the proposed Commission.  (NOTE: </p><p>Vivanco is a long-time friend of Gutierrez, and his </p><p>objectivity has been questioned by some.  We know Vivanco, </p><p>however, and believe his involvement can be helpful.) Human </p><p>rights groups are concerned that this may be a ploy on behalf </p><p>of the GOG to hijack the Commission, but are refraining from </p><p>public comment until they collectively decide how to proceed. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: We are pleased by the continued press </p><p>coverage of the proposal.  We will maintain the high-level </p><p>dialogue on the proposal by raising it in press statements </p><p>and in meetings with other GOG officials.  End Comment. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
