<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002835 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/11/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MASS, KPKO, NI, IV </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: IVOIRIEN CEASE-FIRE WILL TAKE MORE WORK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) Jeter-Perry 10/11/02 Telcon </p><p>(B) SECSTATE 196827 </p><p> (C) ABIDJAN 3330 </p><p> (D) ABIDJAN 3381 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During an October 9 conversation with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, ECOWAS Executive Secretary Chambas </p><p>summarized his visit to Cote d\'Ivoire, stating Gbagbo\'s </p><p>insistence that the mutineers relinquish their weapons and </p><p>his reluctance to "legitimize" the rebels were the main </p><p>hurdles to a cease-fire agreement.  Chambas found the rebel </p><p>leaders disciplined and relatively flexible.  They </p><p>disavowed an intention to overthrow Gbagbo and Chambas saw </p><p>no evidence of Burkinabe involvement.  Chambas planned to </p><p>return to Cote d\'Ivoire October 12 hoping to carry with him </p><p>an amended cease-fire agreement that Gbagbo might sign.  As </p><p>part of a cease-fire arrangement, Chambas envisioned </p><p>deployment of 250-500 monitors and suggested that ECOWAS </p><p>would ask the USG and other governments to provide </p><p>logistical and financial support for their eventual </p><p>deployment.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During an October 9 meeting with Ambassador </p><p>(accompanied by PolCouns and POLMIL), ECOWAS Executive </p><p>Secretary Chambas and Deputy Executive Secretary Diarra </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>indicated they had made some progress and were somewhat </p><p>encouraged by their meetings with the rebel leaders. </p><p>However, they were ultimately unable to get Gbagbo to sign </p><p>the cease-fire agreement.  Despite the difficulties with </p><p>Gbagbo, Chambas and Diarra underscored ECOWAS\' commitment </p><p>to peacefully resolve the crisis.  Chambas shared his plans </p><p>to return to Cote d\'Ivoire on October 12 to begin another </p><p>round of discussions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The ECOWAS officials recognized that more than </p><p>Ivoirien stability was at stake.  Should this situation </p><p>linger other countries, such as Liberia and Burkina Faso, </p><p>could be drawn into the tempest.  Moreover, the already </p><p>weak national economies in Cote d\'Ivoire\'s immediate </p><p>neighborhood would suffer should the Ivoirien economy be </p><p>paralyzed; already prices in Mali had risen exorbitantly, </p><p>Diarra noted.  Due to rising Ivoirien xenophobia, thousands </p><p>of Burkinabe and Malians have already returned home, </p><p>placing unneeded strain on those nations\' weak social </p><p>services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Gbagbo the Reluctant and Stubborn </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Gbagbo was the hurdle to a quick cease-fire, </p><p>Chambas explained.  Gbagbo claimed the draft cease-fire </p><p>proposed was unsatisfactory because it "legitimized" the </p><p>rebels and their seizure of territory.  Gbagbo wanted a </p><p>document that gave an unequivocal ECOWAS endorsement of his </p><p>government.  Gbagbo emphasized an agreement must </p><p>specifically state that negotiations between the sides are </p><p>based on the recognition that his administration is the </p><p>legally constituted government of Cote d\'Ivoire and that </p><p>its authority must be accepted by the rebels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) As a corollary, Gbagbo was adamant that the </p><p>mutineers disarm before a cease-fire could be established. </p><p>Chambas felt that Gbagbo took this inflexible tack because </p><p>he was hamstrung by hard-liners within his own </p><p>administration and military.  The Minister of Defense and </p><p>the Colonel in charge of the soldiers deployed in the </p><p>Bouake area wanted to "redeem their honor" after being </p><p>stung by the rebels.  The military wanted an offensive and </p><p>would react negatively if Gbagbo appeared too soft on the </p><p>rebels.  Also, the tide of public opinion in Abidjan </p><p>supported the hard-liners, Chambas noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Chambas believed the key to getting Gbagbo\'s </p><p>signature was to amend the agreement in such a way that </p><p>demonstrated the superior legal status of the Government </p><p>yet without alienating the rebels by implying that they are </p><p>common criminals.  Chambas said the angle he planned to </p><p>take was to present a new document to Gbagbo, telling him, </p><p>that after consultations with President Wade, the document </p><p>was amended to accommodate the GOCI\'s reservations. </p><p>(COMMENT: While we cannot be sure, the Senegalese document </p><p>contained in reftel D may have been transmitted to the GOCI </p><p>by Dakar without Chambas\' input. It might not be what he </p><p>had in mind.  This may indicate that coordination between </p><p>Wade and Chambas is not perfect.  We hope that it clarifies </p><p>rather than muddies the situation.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Chambas stated that after returning to Dakar from </p><p>Abidjan, he and President Wade agreed that Malian President </p><p>Toure (ATT) would head the ECOWAS contact group on Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire.  The contact group would be ineffective without </p><p>one of the six Presidents having a mandate to act on behalf </p><p>of the entire group.  Gathering six Presidents for meetings </p><p>would prove difficult, Chambas feared.  ATT was selected </p><p>because of Mali\'s manifest interests in events in Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire and because Gbagbo trusts him.  Chambas added that </p><p>Gbagbo also placed great trust in Ghana\'s Kufuor, who has </p><p>been in regular contact with Gbagbo urging him to exercise </p><p>restraint and statesmanship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>The Rebels: More Reasonable than Expected </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The rebel leaders made a better than expected </p><p>impression on Chambas and Diarra.  Chambas stated that the </p><p>rebels appeared disciplined, rational and also flexible in </p><p>their discussions.  The two primary rebel leaders agreed to </p><p>a cease-fire and disavowed that they wanted Gbagbo\'s </p><p>removal.  They argued for the safe return of Ivoiriens </p><p>still in exile.  When Ambassador Jeter asked Chambas about </p><p>the practicality of President Obasanjo\'s informal proposal </p><p>to provide the rebels safe-haven outside of Cote d\'Ivoire, </p><p>Chambas replied that most of the rebels were in their </p><p>twenties and thirties.  He saw the provision of educational </p><p>opportunities, hopefully in a "distant and cold climate", </p><p>as a safety valve for many of the rebels.  Others would </p><p>simply like to remain in Cote d\'Ivoire, but without the </p><p>threat of retribution from the authorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) When asked about foreign involvement in the </p><p>conflict, Chambas and Diarra said the GOIC provided no </p><p>"credible evidence" of mercenaries or foreign government </p><p>support.  The rebel leaders admitted to Chambas that many </p><p>rebels had lived in exile in Burkina Faso prior to the </p><p>rebellion.  However, during his conversations with GOBF </p><p>officials, he was reminded that it has long been Burkinabe </p><p>policy to grant asylum to Ivoirien exiles.  Even Gbagbo was </p><p>a past beneficiary of Burkinabe hospitality.  It would be </p><p>wrong to deduce Burkinabe complicity just because some of </p><p>the rebels had lived there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Turning to ECOWAS participation in the cease-fire </p><p>arrangement, Chambas envisioned 250-500 monitors from the </p><p>member states.  If it would enhance the confidence of </p><p>either side, ECOWAS was willing to ask non-ECOWAS African </p><p>states to furnish a complement of monitors as well.  He did </p><p>not foresee this presence to be the inter-positional force </p><p>advocated by some in the region.  Instead, he saw this </p><p>deployment as having a mandate limited to monitoring cease- </p><p>fire compliance.  He felt a presence of this size would be </p><p>a sufficient confidence-builder, provided the two sides </p><p>actually had the will to observe the cease-fire.  Chambas </p><p>intimated that ECOWAS probably would look to the U.S., </p><p>U.K., France and other donors for financial and logistical </p><p>assistance for the deployment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) COMMENT: Chambas has his work cut out for him.  He </p><p>must diplomatically thread the needle by amending the </p><p>cease-fire agreement to Gbagbo\'s liking while not </p><p>alienating the rebels.  Additionally, he must contend with </p><p>the mercurial interventions and unpredictability of ECOWAS\' </p><p>Chairman Wade.  Despite these obstacles, there is no doubt </p><p>that ECOWAS remains actively engaged, as evinced by </p><p>Chambas\' planned return to Cote d\'Ivoire.  More </p><p>importantly, ECOWAS remains committed to a negotiated </p><p>settlement.  We must continue to encourage Chambas while </p><p>also urging leaders in the region whom Gbagbo trusts (ATT, </p><p>Kufuor and Obasanjo) to point their Ivoirien counterpart </p><p>toward the negotiation table.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) UPDATE: Chambas phoned Ambassador on October 11 to </p><p>report that Senegalese Foreign Minister Gadio was currently </p><p>in Abidjan and had established contact with the rebels.  As </p><p>reported Ref. A, Chambas provided his view that Gbagbo </p><p>seemed to be softening his hard-line stance, and now </p><p>appeared more disposed toward an agreement with the rebels. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
