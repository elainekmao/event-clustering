<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 00158 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IN,  CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOI OFFICIAL ON STRENGTH OF LTTE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  NEW DELHI 102 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  REFTEL (MFA UNDERSECRETARY FOR SRI LANKA\'S COM- </p><p>MENTS ON LATEST IPKF TROOP WITHDRAWAL) PRESENTS AN </p><p>INTERESTING SNAPSHOT OF CURRENT SOUTH BLOCK THINKING </p><p>ON SITUATION IN NORTHEASTERN PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON THE ROLE OF LTTE, HOWEVER, THE WORKING-LEVEL </p><p>INDIAN HIGH COMMISSION OFFICIAL WHO DEALS MOST CLOSELY </p><p>WITH ALL ASPECTS OF INDIA\'S ROLE IN NORTHEASTERN </p><p>PROVINCE, DR. S. JAISHANKAR, PRESENTS A SOMEWHAT MORE </p><p>SOBER VIEW OF CURRENT STRENGTH OF THE LTTE.  HE </p><p>SAYS THAT THE LTTE HAS BEEN OUTMANEUVERED IN THE </p><p>EAST AND IS NO LONGER OF MUCH IMPORTANCE THERE.  BUT </p><p>HE TOLD POLCOUNS JAN 6 THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY STILL </p><p>2000-3000 TIGERS IN THE OLD NORTHERN PROVINCE, IN </p><p>WANNI AREA SOUTH OF ELEPHANT PASS, AND THAT THEY CAN </p><p>CONTINUE TO ELUDE IPKF.  JAISHANKAR SAID THAT A STEADY </p><p>(ALBEIT SMALLER THAN PRE-JULY 1987) STREAM OF WEAPONS </p><p>STILL COME ACROSS THE PALK STRAIT TO THE TIGERS, </p><p>AND DENIED THAT THE SECURITY OFFICIALS IN TAMIL NADU </p><p>WERE CAPABLE OF MORE THAN MARGINALLY AFFECTING THIS </p><p>TRAFFIC, WHICH HE POINTED OUT, DREW ON TIES BETWEEN </p><p>FISHING/SMUGGLING COMMUNITIES WHICH DATE BACK A </p><p>HUNDRED YEARS.  HE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ABOUT WHAT </p><p>WOULD HAPPEN TO SUPPORT FOR THE LTTE IN TAMIL NADU IF </p><p>THE DMK WERE TO WIN IN THE JANUARY 21 ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE INDIANS SEE THE FEB 15 GENERAL ELECTION HERE </p><p>AS A REAL TEST OF STRENGTH IN WHAT USED TO BE NORTHERN </p><p>PROVINCE, PARTICULARLY IN JAFFNA PENINSULA WHERE THE </p><p>LTTE CONTINUES TO EXERT SOME POLITICAL FORCE EVEN </p><p>THOUGH ABLE TO DO ALMOST NOTHING MILITARILY.  JAISHANKAR </p><p>SAID THAT IPKF WILL GO ALL OUT TO HELP ENSURE A BIG </p><p>TURNOUT IN THAT ELECTION SINCE THE INDIANS EXPECT THE </p><p>LTTE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A BOYCOTT OF THE POLLS. </p><p>HE IMPLIED THAT THE GOI WOULD VIEW A 65 PER CENT TURN- </p><p>OUT IN JAFFNA PENINSULA AS A REAL VICTORY FOR HIS SIDE </p><p>BUT REFUSED TO SPECULATE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE </p><p>TURNOUT WERE LOW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN </p><p></p></div>
