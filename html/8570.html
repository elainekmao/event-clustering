<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000982 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Department for D (Gastright), INR/MR, I/RW, I/REC, </p><p>SA (Camp, Waller), SA/PD (Brennig, Irwin, Scensny, SSA/PAS, </p><p>SSO (Pass to D); Tokyo (Hara, Bryan) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY: (June 7) Tokyo Conference; Colombo </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  The Sri Lankan media continued its feverish </p><p>coverage of whether or not the Tigers will go to Tokyo. </p><p>The LTTE\'s Tamilchelvan said that if the Tigers\' request </p><p>for an interim administration is met, they might yet go to </p><p>Japan.  Tamil newspaper headlines buzzed with Minister </p><p>Moragoda\'s pre-departure reassurances that the Tigers will </p><p>not be forgotten after Tokyo, and were full of GSL and US </p><p>exhortations urging the LTTE to attend the donor </p><p>conference.  English and vernacular press reported that </p><p>Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is optimistic the LTTE </p><p>will return to the negotiating table.  An editorial in the </p><p>nationalist-leaning daily the ISLAND asked, "Can mighty </p><p>nations be blackmailed?" and answered that the Tigers\' </p><p>absence from Tokyo, ".Is an attempt to intimidate the </p><p>`international community\' involved as well as the Sri Lanka </p><p>government and make the "peace process" wag according to </p><p>their dictates."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>2. LTTE statements and other Tamil reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>In English and vernacular newscasts, state-owned SLRC </p><p>television reported on an LTTE press conference in </p><p>Kilinochchi.   LTTE political wing leader Tamilchelvan said </p><p>the LTTE has not given up on the idea of attending the </p><p>Tokyo Conference.  He stated that if the Tigers receive a </p><p>favorable reply from the government for their request to </p><p>administer development and rehabilitation work in the north </p><p>and east, they would attend.  He also noted that there are </p><p>two more days for this decision to be made, and that </p><p>whatever situation arises, the LTTE will not revert to war. </p><p> </p><p>Tamil newspaper headlines buzzed with Minister Moragoda\'s </p><p>pre-departure reassurances that the Tigers will not be </p><p>forgotten after Tokyo.  LTTE-leaning SUDAR OLI quoted him, </p><p>"We will not undervalue the cooperation of the Tigers in </p><p>the development work in NE, [even] though [they are] not </p><p>attending the Tokyo Conference," while State-owned </p><p>THINAKARAN added, "Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will </p><p>explain at the Tokyo Conference how we will utilize foreign </p><p>aid - We will not betray the Tigers."  Moragoda\'s comfort </p><p>continued with independent daily VIRAKESARI\'s headline, </p><p>"Peace efforts to be carried forward with new energy after </p><p>the Conference." </p><p> </p><p>Tamil dailies also sang with GSL and US exhortations urging </p><p>the Tigers to go to Tokyo.  LTTE-leaning SUDAR OLI quoted </p><p>Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, "I am anxious to see </p><p>the Tigers at the Tokyo Conference."  All major Tamil </p><p>dailies focused on USAID Deputy Administrator Fred </p><p>Schieck\'s 6/6 comments in Colombo.  State-owned daily </p><p>THINAKARAN quoted Schieck, "US hopeful Tigers will attend </p><p>Tokyo Conference," while independent daily VIRAKESARI </p><p>continued, "Big loss to the Tamil people if the Tigers do </p><p>not attend the Tokyo Conference - There\'s time until </p><p>tomorrow." </p><p> </p><p>Pro-LTTE website Tamilnet headlined, "Colombo JVP </p><p>demonstration attracts more than 10,000," and continued, </p><p>"More than ten-thousand members and activists, including </p><p>parliamentary members of the Sinhala nationalist party, the </p><p>Janata Vimukti Peramuna (JVP), took part in a massive rally </p><p>in Sri Lanka\'s capital Colombo, Friday afternoon, </p><p>protesting against attempts by the Sri Lanka government to </p><p>hand over Northeast interim administration to the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), political sources </p><p>in Colombo said." </p><p> </p><p>Tamil editorialists were silent. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>3. GSL statements and pro-government reaction </p><p>----- </p><p>Various media outlets in Sri Lanka picked up a BBC Asia </p><p>Today interview with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. </p><p>BBC online reported, "Sri Lanka\'s prime minister says he </p><p>has no doubt that Tamil Tiger rebels are committed to peace </p><p>and that direct talks with the government will resume." </p><p> </p><p>Vernacular and English newscasts on state-owned SLRC </p><p>television echoed the BBC and reported that Prime Minister </p><p>Ranil Wickremesinghe is optimistic the LTTE will return to </p><p>the negotiating table.  SLRC also covered Minister </p><p>Moragoda\'s airport reassurances to the Tigers - that the </p><p>GSL is not underestimating LTTE participation in </p><p>development of the north and east, and that the GSL wants </p><p>to solve problems with the LTTE through discussion. </p><p>Moragoda noted the GSL\'s desire to proceed with development </p><p>work in the north and east at a faster pace after the Tokyo </p><p>conference. </p><p> </p><p>Like the Tamil press, English and Sinhala newspapers also </p><p>concentrated on GSL and US statements encouraging the LTTE </p><p>to go to Tokyo.  Independent English DAILY MIRROR </p><p>headlined, "Direct talks will resume soon, Tokyo a turning </p><p>point: PM."  State-owned Sinhala daily DINAMINA offered, </p><p>"US expresses hope that LTTE will go to Japan," while </p><p>independent Sinhala daily LANKADEEPA went a step further, </p><p>"America Warns LTTE - \'Wrong signal to the world by </p><p>boycotting Tokyo confab.\'" </p><p> </p><p>There were no pro-government editorials. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>4. Opposition statements and pro-opposition reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Independent television station MTV reported that Lakshman </p><p>Kadirgamar, Presidential Advisor on International Affairs </p><p>and Former Minister of Foreign Affairs, hopes that there </p><p>will be another chance for the UNF and the PA to find a </p><p>common approach to solve the ethnic conflict after the </p><p>Tokyo conference. </p><p>One newspaper sympathetic to the opposition editorialized. </p><p>The ISLAND (independent, but nationalist-leaning English </p><p>daily) asked,  "Can mighty nations be blackmailed?" and </p><p>answered, "The threat to keep off [the Tokyo Conference] is </p><p>an attempt to intimidate the "international community" </p><p>involved as well as the Sri Lanka government and make the </p><p>"peace process" wag according to their dictates." </p><p> </p><p>Block quotes: </p><p> </p><p>"The decision to go ahead with the Tokyo Conference with or </p><p>without the participation of the LTTE will be proved </p><p>correct in the long run. </p><p>"Neither the LTTE nor the Tamil community stand to gain by </p><p>keeping off Tokyo.  It will aggravate the suffering of the </p><p>people of the north and east.  The threat to keep off is an </p><p>attempt to intimidate the "international community" </p><p>involved as well as the Sri Lanka government and make the </p><p>"peace process" wag according to their dictates. </p><p>"The fault lies with the Sri Lanka government.  They </p><p>pampered the terrorists and gave in to practically every </p><p>demand while looking away from gross violations of the law </p><p>and the cease-fire agreement.  At some stage, some of our </p><p>enthusiastic peace negotiators were anxious to confer on </p><p>the LTTE the same status as that of the Sri Lanka </p><p>government.  And that is what appears to figure in the </p><p>background of demands that are being made. </p><p>"It is quite apparent that the indulgent attitudes of the </p><p>Prime Minister and the international community have </p><p>encouraged the LTTE to go ahead with bulldozing tactics. </p><p>Such bulldozing is no way to peace and the LTTE have to be </p><p>made to realize that.  Peace is a two-way process. </p><p>"The LTTE most probably will be having its own unorthodox </p><p>plans if they do not turn up at Tokyo.  Whether such plans </p><p>are to go back to the gun and the bomb or not, it is time </p><p>that this childish and petulant behavior has to be called </p><p>to a halt. </p><p>"This group of terrorists should be told that they cannot </p><p>blackmail mighty nations." </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
