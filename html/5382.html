<p>S E C R E T ABU DHABI 000495 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/NGA, NEA/ARP AND PMAT </p><p>NSC FOR ABRAMS AND CLARKE </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD AMBASSADOR LITT </p><p>CENTAF FOR GENERAL MOSELEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, KU, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  (S) UAE CHIEF OF STAFF VOLUNTEERS </p><p>FORCES FOR DEFENSE OF KUWAIT, BUT </p><p>KUWAIT NEEDS TO ASK </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ABU DHABI 479 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Following up on a question posed by UAE MFA Minstate </p><p>Hamdan to NEA A/S Burns during a 1/22 meeting in Abu Dhabi </p><p>(reftel), UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Muhammad Bin Zayid </p><p>Al-Nahyan (MbZ) told visiting Deputy CENTCOM Commander LTG </p><p>John Abizaid 1/29 that the UAE is prepared to send forces to </p><p>Kuwait in an Iraq contingency.  Echoing Hamdan, MbZ said the </p><p>first step would be for Kuwait -- under the umbrella of </p><p>Peninsula Shield -- to request its GCC partners to send </p><p>forces for its defense.  MbZ said he would be calling Kuwait </p><p>Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Fahd this evening (1/29) </p><p>with that very suggestion and would tell his Kuwaiti </p><p>counterpart that the UAE could send men and material within </p><p>24 hours if asked.  MbZ noted that the UAE was willing to </p><p>send its Land Forces and to provide air support, or in his </p><p>words, "whatever it takes."  He was fully aware of the </p><p>Bahraini decision to deploy a frigate to Kuwait and noted </p><p>that the UAE Navy has offered to send missile patrol boats </p><p>as well. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Comment:  MbZ\'s offer is further evidence that the </p><p>UAE is fully on board with our Iraq policy and recognizes </p><p>the need for the Gulf states to become active partners. </p><p>Using the umbrella of Peninsula Shield and the obligations </p><p>inherent under the GCC\'s mutual defense pact is a clever </p><p>tactic and shows just how willing the Emiratis are to think </p><p>outside of the box as we move forward.  MBZ said that it was </p><p>not only the UAEG which would respond positively to a </p><p>Kuwaiti request, noting that "if they (the Kuwaitis) ask, </p><p>everyone in the GCC will have to respond positively."  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
