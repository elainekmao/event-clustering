THE 56TH SESSION OF THE UNIDROIT FINANCE COMMITTEE </p><p>MET ON OCTOBER 22, 2002.  AS REPORTED IN REFTEL E, THE </p><p>55TH SESSION OF THE COMMITTEE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO APPROVE </p><p>A BUDGET DUE TO MEMBER CONCERNS (JAPAN, ITALY, FRANCE, </p><p>SWITZERLAND) ABOUT A LAST-MINUTE INCREASE IN THE BUDGET </p><p>PROPOSAL (TO ALLOW UNIDROIT TO CARRY OUT ITS FUNCTIONS AS </p><p>DEPOSITARY FOR THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED CAPETOWN CONVENTION </p><p>ON INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS IN MOBILE EQUIPMENT) AND THE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ITALY THAT IT WAS </p><p>REDUCING ITS CONTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.

(NONETHELESS, </p><p>THE U.S. CONTRIBUTION REMAINS THE SAME (EURO 110,000) AS </p><p>IN THE ORIGINAL BUDGET LEVEL.)  WHILE FUNDING FOR </p><p>SCHOLARSHIPS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRY RESEARCHERS AND FOR </p><p>CONSULTANTS WAS REDUCED, THE RE-DRAFTED BUDGET DOES NOT </p><p>PROVIDE THE MEANS FOR UNIDROIT TO CARRY OUT THE FUNCTIONS </p><p>OF DEPOSITARY FOR THE CAPETOWN CONVENTION.

THE FINANCE COMMITTEE APPROVED THE OVERALL BUDGET </p><p>LEVEL.  USDEL STATED THAT, WHILE THE U.S. WOULD NOT BLOCK </p><p>CONSENSUS, THE U.S. POSITION WAS AND REMAINED ZERO </p><p>NOMINAL GROWTH. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN DISCUSSION OF THE RE-DRAFTED BUDGET, MEXICO, </p><p>FRANCE, GERMANY, SPAIN, SWITZERLAND AND AUSTRIA EXPRESSED </p><p>DIFFICULTIES WITH THE SECRETARIAT\'S PROPOSAL TO REDUCE </p><p>"LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES" (PRIMARILY </p><p>SCHOLARSHIPS FOR RESEARCH).  USDEL STATED THAT THIS WAS </p><p>AN APPROPRIATE LINE ITEM FROM WHICH TO SEEK SAVINGS, AND </p><p>ENCOURAGED COUNTRIES TO CONSIDER VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>FOR SUCH SCHOLARSHIPS INSTEAD.  AS A RESULT OF THESE </p><p>CONCERNS THE SECRETARIAT WILL JUGGLE SOME OF THE INTERNAL </p><p>LINE ITEMS WITH A VIEW TO PROVIDING MORE FUNDING FOR </p><p>SCHOLARSHIPS WHILE STAYING WITHIN THE APPROVED BUDGET </p><p>ENVELOPE.  THE REVISED PROPOSAL WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE </p><p>DECEMBER 6 GENERAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  CONCERNING THE DEPOSITARY FUNCTIONS, JAPAN AND </p><p>AUSTRIA ALSO EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR UNIDROIT CARRYING OUT </p><p>THESE FUNCTIONS, BUT STATED THAT THE PROPOSAL HAD COME IN </p><p>TOO LATE FOR CONSIDERATIONS IN CAPITALS.  THESE COUNTRIES </p><p>SAID THAT THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE DEPOSITARY FUNCTION </p><p>WOULD BE GIVEN MORE SYMPATHETIC CONSIDERATION IN NEXT </p><p>YEAR\'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05491  120655Z </p><p> </p><p>7.
