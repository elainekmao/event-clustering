SUMMARY:  IN A RECENT PROTEST AGAINST UNRESOLVED </p><p>LAND DISPUTES, 100 FARMERS FROM THREE PROVINCES CAMPED </p><p>OUT OVERNIGHT IN FRONT OF PARTY HEADQUARTERS AND THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE IN HANOI.  THEIR DEMONSTRATION, </p><p>WHICH RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>MEDIA, WAS ONE MORE SIGN THAT THE NEW COMPLAINTS LAW </p><p>MECHANISM AND "GRASS ROOTS DEMOCRACY" PROGRAMS ENACTED </p><p>TO COPE WITH RURAL LAND DISPUTES AND CORRUPTION ISSUES </p><p>IN THE WAKE OF THE 1997 THAI BINH INCIDENTS HAVE NOT </p><p>BEEN ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL.  IN RECENT MONTHS, THE GVN </p><p>HAS SENT HIGH LEVEL WORKING GROUPS TO SPEED UP </p><p>RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN NUMEROUS PROVINCES. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02441  01 OF 04  061011Z </p><p>VIETNAMESE MEDIA HAVE BEEN DEVOTING INCREASING </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM.  BUT THE WORKING GROUPS </p><p>APPEAR NOT TO HAVE FULLY SATISFIED PEASANT DEMANDS. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DOES NOT SEEM LIKELY TO </p><p>PASS NEEDED AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPLAINTS LAW BEFORE </p><p>NEXT YEAR\'S PARTY CONGRESS AT THE EARLIEST.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FARMERS CAMP OUT AT PARTY HEADQUARTERS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. ON OCTOBER 18, A GROUP OF ABOUT 100 FARMERS FROM THE </p><p>PROVINCES OF NAM DINH, THAI BINH, AND QUANG NINH SET UP </p><p>TENTS OUTSIDE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) </p><p>HEADQUARTERS AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER. </p><p>FRUSTRATED BY GOVERNMENT FAILURE TO RESOLVE TO THEIR </p><p>SATISFACTION COMPLAINTS OVER LAND DISPUTES, THE FARMERS </p><p>WERE DEMONSTRATING AGAINST CORRUPT LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO </p><p>THEY BELIEVE ARE AT FAULT.  RESPONDING TO A REPORTER\'S </p><p>QUESTION ABOUT THE CAMP OUT, MFA SPOKESPERSON PHAN THUY </p><p>THANH SAID THE PROTEST TOOK PLACE AFTER LOCAL </p><p>INSPECTION TEAMS HAD ALREADY REVIEWED THE FARMERS\' </p><p>COMPLAINTS AND PROPOSED DISCIPLINARY MEASURES AGAINST </p><p>THE LOCAL OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE. THE NEXT DAY, AFTER </p><p>THE GVN HAD (IN THANH\'S WORDS) "PROMPTLY INSTRUCTED </p><p>COMPETENT BODIES TO TAKE CARE OF THE MATTER," THE GROUP </p><p>DISPERSED.  THANH SAID THAT THE STATE INSPECTOR GENERAL </p><p>AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE HAD </p><p>BEEN SENT TO MEET WITH THEM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SIMILARLY, ABOUT 150 PERSONS, COMPRISING SEVEN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02441  01 OF 04  061011Z </p><p>SEPARATE GROUPS OF FARMERS FROM MEKONG DELTA PROVINCES </p><p>AND DISTRICTS OF HCMC, HAVE BEEN CAMPED OUT IN FRONT OF </p><p>A GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVE AFFAIRS BUILDING THERE FOR </p><p>NEARLY THREE MONTHS.  OFFICIALS HAVE ACCEPTED THEIR </p><p>WRITTEN PETITIONS, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT TYPE OF </p><p>DIALOGUE, IF ANY, IS TAKING PLACE BETWEEN THESE GROUPS </p><p>OF DEMONSTRATORS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  POLICE HAVE </p><p>ERECTED BARRICADES TO KEEP THEM OFF THE SIDEWALK </p><p>DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE GOVERNMENT BUILDING, BUT HAVE </p><p>ALLOWED THEM TO REMAIN ON THE SIDEWALK ACROSS THE </p><p>STREET.  THE POLICE HAVE BEEN "POLITE," ACCORDING TO </p><p>ONE OF THE DEMONSTRATORS WHO SPOKE WITH CONGENOFF REF </p><p>B. </p><p> </p><p>THE NEW COMPLAINTS LAW IS NOT WORKING </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. THE PROTEST AND THE PUBLIC ATTENTION IT RECEIVED ARE </p><p>ONE MORE SIGN THAT THE COMPLAINTS LAW AND "GRASSROOTS </p><p>DEMOCRACY" PROGRAMS CREATED AFTER THE 1997 THAI BINH </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS (REF C) HAVE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY </p><p>ADDRESS RURAL DISCONTENT WITH GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION AND </p><p>INEFFICIENCY.  IN PART, THIS MAY BE BECAUSE PASSAGE OF </p><p>THE LAW RAISED EXPECTATIONS.  SIZEABLE NUMBERS OF </p><p>VIETNAMESE FARMERS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE COMPLAINTS LAW </p><p>AFTER ITS PASSAGE LAST YEAR TO REPORT CORRUPTION AND </p><p>COMPLAIN ABOUT COMPENSATION ON LAND ISSUES HANDLED BY </p><p>LOCAL OFFICIALS.  THE OCTOBER 18 HANOI DEMONSTRATION </p><p>WAS NOTEWORTHY BECAUSE, UNLIKE SOME PREVIOUS </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS HERE, FARMERS FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT </p><p>PROVINCES JOINED FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>A FEARFUL GVN TRIES TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM QUICKLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION TO UILIZE HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>TEAMS LIKELY REFLECTS A CONCERNTHAT LOCAL OFFICIALS </p><p>ARE NOT GOING TO BE IMPARTIL IN REVIEWING THEIR OWN </p><p>LOCAL DECISIONS.  IN SEPEMBER, PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN </p><p>KHAI SENT FIVE WOKING GROUPS, EACH LED BY A DIFFERENT </p><p>CABINET MEMBER, TO THIRTEEN PROVINCES AND CITIES TO </p><p>ADDRESS LOCAL DISCONTENT, A SIGN OF HOW SERIOUSLY THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02441  02 OF 04  061011Z </p><p>GVN TAKES THE ISSUE. THEY WERE SENT TO THE FIFTEEN </p><p>PROVINCES WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF UNSETTLED PUBLIC </p><p>COMPLAINTS AND DENUNCIATIONS CASES.  (REF A).  THIS WAS </p><p>IN ADDITION TO A SPECIAL TASK FORCE FORMED EARLIER IN </p><p>THE YEAR TO DEAL WITH THE GROWING PROBLEM OF </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS GATHERING OUTSIDE THE HOMES OF VIETNAMESE </p><p>LEADERS TO LODGE COMPLAINTS.  ACCORDING TO MASS- </p><p>CIRCULATION CPV-AFFILIATED DAILY "NHAN DAN" ("THE </p><p>PEOPLE") OCTOBER 25, KHAI SUBSEQUENTLY DECIDED TO </p><p>DELEGATE YET ANOTHER INTER-AGENCY WORK GROUP, THIS ONE </p><p>LED BY INDUSTRY MINISTER DANG VU CHU, TO SPEED UP THE </p><p>SETTLEMENT OF PUBLIC COMPLAINTS AND DENUNCIATIONS IN </p><p>THREE MEKONG DELTA PROVINCES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THESE VARIOUS WORKING GROUPS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>GRANTED MAJOR DECISION-MAKING POWERS.  VICE DIRECTOR OF </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE LE NGOC TOAN QUOTED PARTY </p><p>CHIEF LE KHA PHIEU SEPTEMBER 6 AS SAYING THAT HEADS OF </p><p>THE WORKING GROUPS COULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER TO TEMPORARILY WITHDRAW PROVINCIAL </p><p>LEADERS FROM THEIR POSTS.  ACCORDING TO STATE GENERAL </p><p>INSPECTOR TA HUU THANH, THE HEADS OF THE WORKING GROUPS </p><p>HAVE THE FINAL SAY IN CASE DISCREPANCIES ARISING </p><p>BETWEEN THEM AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES DURING THEIR </p><p>REVIEW. </p><p> </p><p>7.  A SIDE EFFECT OF THE HIGH LEVEL WORKING GROUPS IS </p><p>THAT SOME LOCAL POPULATIONS LOOK TO THEM FOR DECISIONS </p><p>WHICH WOULD ORDINARILY BE MADE BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES. </p><p>SOME NATIONAL LEVEL LEADERS SEE THIS AS A PROBLEM. </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY VICE CHAIRMAN MAI PHUC LAM HAS SAID </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02441  02 OF 04  061011Z </p><p>THAT "MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S WORKING </p><p>GROUPS CAN REPLACE LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN DEALING WITH </p><p>DENUNCIATIONS AND COMPLAINTS TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. </p><p>THIS WILL CREATE A PRECEDENT SO THAT PEOPLE WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO SUBMIT THEIR COMPLAINTS AND DENUNCIATIONS </p><p>TO THE PARTY AND THE GOVERNMENT WHENEVER THEY ARE NOT </p><p>SATISFIED WITH THE SOLUTIONS OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES." </p><p>HEALTH MINISTER DO NGUYEN PHUONG, WHO HEADS ONE OF THE </p><p>WORKING GROUPS, NOTED THAT "IN ALL THE PROVINCES OUR </p><p>GROUP HAS WORKED IN, PEOPLE NOW EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO SEND SPECIAL WORKING GROUPS ONCE A YEAR."  OBVIOUSLY </p><p>THESE NATIONAL OFFICIALS BELIEVE THE LOCAL SYSTEMS NEED </p><p>TO BE STRENGTHENED TO GIVE THE PEOPLE CONFIDENCE IN </p><p>DECISIONS AT THAT LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>WORKING GROUPS GET RESULTS IN THE SOUTH </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE INCREASED NATIONAL ATTENTION THE GVN IS </p><p>DEVOTING TO THE ISSUE OF LOCAL LEVEL CORRUPTION AND </p><p>MISMANAGEMENT HAS GOTTEN SOME RESULTS.  HCMC PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN VO VIET THANH OCTOBER 24 TOOK THE </p><p>HIGHLY UNUSUAL STEP OF MAKING A PUBLIC APOLOGY TO </p><p>FORMER RESIDENTS OF TWO MUNICIPAL DISTRICTS.  HE SAID </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN THESE TWO DISTRICTS HAD BEEN WRONG IN </p><p>THE PAST TO INAPPROPRIATELY CLEAR LAND AND PROVIDE </p><p>INADEQUATE COMPENSATION.  THANH PROMISED THAT </p><p>APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION WOULD BE GIVEN TO THOSE </p><p>AFFECTED AND THAT OFFENDING OFFICIALS WOULD BE </p><p>DISCIPLINED.  HE ALSO SAID HE WOULD SUBMIT HIS </p><p>RESIGNATION IF THE COMPLAINTS WERE NOT SETTLED BY THE </p><p>END OF NOVEMBER. HCMC AND SOUTHERN PROVINCIAL </p><p>NEWSPAPERS HAVE ALSO COVERED THE WORK OF THE WORKING </p><p>GROUPS WITH INTEREST. ON OCTOBER 31, STATE GENERAL </p><p>INSPECTOR THANH RECOMMENDED THE HEAD OF BA RIA-VUNG TAU </p><p>PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S PROCURACY BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE </p><p>BECAUSE OF INAPPROPRIATE LAND CLEARANCE ACTIVITIES HE </p><p>PRESIDED OVER IN HIS FORMER POSITION OF DISTRICT </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN. THE NOVEMBER 1 EDITION OF </p><p>HCMC-BASED "THANH NHIEN" ("YOUTH") DAILY REPORTED IN </p><p>DETAIL THE SUB-WORKING GROUPS ACTIVITIES LEADING TO </p><p>THIS RECOMMENDATION. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02441  03 OF 04  061011Z </p><p> </p><p>NEWSPAPERS VENTURING TO COMMENT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  VIETNAMESE MEDIA HAVE PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT COVERAGE </p><p>TO THE FACTS SURROUNDING RECENT DISCONTENT WITHOUT </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENT.  HANOI\'S "LAO DONG" ("LABOR") AND </p><p>HCMC "TUOI TRE" ("YOUTH") HAVE BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT, </p><p>CARRYING INTERVIEWS WITH DEPUTY PM NGUYEN CONG TAN, WHO </p><p>OVERSEES THE WORKING GROUPS, AND STATE INSPECTOR </p><p>GENERAL THANH. </p><p> </p><p>10.  TAN TOLD "LAO DONG" OCTOBER 13 THAT "THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION REGARDING THE LARGE NUMBER OF NEW AND </p><p>UNSETTLED CASES OF SERIOUS PUBLIC COMPLAINTS AND </p><p>DENUNCIATIONS IS UNACCEPTABLE."  THE PROBLEM HAS </p><p>EXISTED FOR SOME TIME, HE SAID, ANGERING THE COMMON </p><p>PEOPLE.  "IF IT CONTINUES, IT COULD SPREAD TO OTHER </p><p>SOUND ACTIVITIES OF SOCIETY".  TAN ALSO SAID THAT MOST </p><p>OF THE PUBLIC COMPLAINTS AND DENUNCIATIONS ARE IN THE </p><p>FIELD OF LAND AND HOUSING MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR LAND CLEARANCE. </p><p> </p><p>NEW LAWS ALONE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  VIETNAMESE OBSERVERS SPECULATE THAT THE REASON FOR </p><p>THE GROWING NUMBER OF PUBLIC COMPLAINTS AND </p><p>DENUNCIATIONS IS THE CONTINUING LACK OF AN EFFICIENT </p><p>MECHANISM FOR HANDLING THEM.  AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL, </p><p>THERE IS A TENDENCY FOR PUBLIC COMPLAINTS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02441  03 OF 04  061011Z </p><p>THOSE REGARDING LAND DISPUTES AND CORRUPTION, TO BE </p><p>DEALT WITH "DISCREETLY," ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, </p><p>RATHER THAN OUT IN THE OPEN.  THIS HAS LEFT LOCAL </p><p>RESIDENTS ANGRY OVER WHAT THEY SEE AS A LACK OF </p><p>TRANSPARENCY.  THEY CHARGE THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS OFTEN </p><p>CHOOSE QUIETLY TO SUPPRESS COMPLAINTS RATHER THAN </p><p>OPENLY DISCUSS THE CONCERNS OF COMPLAINANTS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE COMPLAINTS LAW CALLS FOR EXPEDITIOUS HANDLING </p><p>OF COMPLAINTS AND DENUNCIATIONS WITH AUTOMATIC TIME </p><p>LIMITS WITHIN WHICH LOCAL OFFICIALS MUST TAKE ACTION. </p><p>DISSATISFIED FARMERS AND OTHERS CHARGE THAT LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES AND THEIR HIGH-LEVEL SUPERIORS TEND TO </p><p>CIRCUMVENT THIS REQUIREMENT FOR TIMELY ADJUDICATIONS BY </p><p>HAVING HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS REFER COMPLAINTS BACK TO </p><p>LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR MORE INFORMATION.  THEY SAY THAT </p><p>IT IS ALL A BUREAUCRATIC SHELL GAME WHOSE OBJECTIVE IS </p><p>TO KEEP THE COMPLAINTS OUT OF SIGHT AND OUT OF MIND </p><p>INDEFINITELY.  THE RESULT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>INCREASE IN PUBLIC DISTRUST. </p><p> </p><p>FLAWS IN THE EXISTING LAW UNLIKELY TO BE AMENDED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>13. ONE MAJOR FLAW IN THE MUCH-DEBATED LAW ON </p><p>COMPLAINTS AND DENUNCIATIONS, ADOPTED BY THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY NOVEMBER 23, 1998, IS THAT IT DOES NOT ALLOW </p><p>ANONYMOUS PLAINTIFFS.  AT THE TIME, THE MEMBER OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY STANDING COMMITTEE WHO IS CHARGED </p><p>WITH HANDLING THE COMPLAINTS ISSUE, NGUYEN THI HOAI </p><p>THU, A PROMINENT NATIONAL VOICE FOR ENACTMENT OF THE </p><p>LAW, PUT THE BEST FACE ON THINGS PUBLICLY.  SHE TOLD AN </p><p>INTERVIEWER FOR "TUOI TRE" THAT DESPITE ITS </p><p>SHORTCOMINGS, THE NEW LAW "RAISES PEOPLE\'S HOPES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE EVER-INCREASING NUMBER OF PUBLIC </p><p>COMPLAINTS AND DENUNCIATIONS, WHICH REPRESENTS A </p><p>GENUINELY SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE COUNTRY."  THU HAS </p><p>PUSHED FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A PERMANENT ASSEMBLY </p><p>COMMITTEE ON COMPLAINTS AND DENUNCIATIONS SINCE 1997, </p><p>BUT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT NGUYEN CHI DUNG TOLD US THAT "HER </p><p>CURRENT PROPOSAL IS LIKELY TO DIE A PREMATURE DEATH." </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02441  04 OF 04  061011Z </p><p>OPPONENTS, HE SAID, WILL SUPPORT THE BILL IN PRINCIPLE </p><p>BUT CITE FINANCIAL REASONS TO OPPOSE PASSAGE AT THE </p><p>MOMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14. COMMENT:  SINCE THE COMPLAINTS LAW WENT INTO EFFECT </p><p>IN JANUARY 1999, NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE WAY LOCAL </p><p>GVN AND CPV OFFICIALS HANDLE DISPUTES.  THE OLD </p><p>PROBLEMS OF GRASSROOTS CORRUPTION AND INEFFICIENCY </p><p>PERSIST.  IF TEETH ARE NOT ADDED TO ENFORCEMENT OF THE </p><p>LAW, THERE WILL BE AN INCREASING LEVEL OF DISCONTENT </p><p>AMONG PEASANTS, JUST WHAT THE CPV AND GVN MOST FEAR. </p><p>VIETNAM\'S LEADERS HAVE YET TO MAKE MUCH PROGRESS ON </p><p>THIS OR RELATED REFORMS, INCLUDING SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>REFORMS AS STREAMLINING THE OPERATIONS OF COURTS AND </p><p>THE NATIONAL PROSECUTORIAL APPARATUS.  BUT WITH </p><p>PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL PARTY CONGRESSES ABOUT TO </p><p>BEGIN, AND A MOOD OF UNCERTAINTY AT ALL LEVELS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT, WE EXPECT FEW DRAMATIC ADVANCES IN THE NEAR </p><p>FUTURE. SENDING OUT WORKING GROUPS SEEMS A STOPGAP </p><p>MEASURE WHICH EVEN NATIONAL LEADERS SEE AS DISRUPTIVE </p><p>TO THE IDEA OF CREATING A RESPONSIBLE AND RESPONSIVE </p><p>LOCAL SYSTEM.  WE EXPECT THEM TO DO LITTLE MORE THAN </p><p>PUT A LID ON IN SOME AREAS MOST AFFECTED BY DISCONTENT. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
