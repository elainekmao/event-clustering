SUMMARY:  THE WAR IN IRAQ, IRAQI CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, AND </p><p>U.S. PLANS FOR POST-WAR IRAQ DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA. </p><p>UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" THAT ONLY THE U.S. </p><p>AND NONE OF ITS ALLIES WILL CONTROL POST-WAR IRAQ.  ANOTHER UAE </p><p>COLUMNIST, DR. SHAMLAN AL EISSA POINTED OUT THAT THE ARAB AND </p><p>GULF COUNTRIES HAVE THE SAME DOUBLE STANDARDS OF WHICH THEY </p><p>ACCUSE THE U.S.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ASSERTING THAT ISRAEL WILL BENEFIT FROM THE WAR IN IRAQ, </p><p>SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 4/7: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE GOAL OF ATTACKING IRAQ IS TO ENSURE THE OIL (IS </p><p>PROTECTED) AND TO ELIMINATE ANY POTENTIAL THREATS AGAINST ISRAEL. </p><p>THIS GOAL IS FAR FROM THE FALSE AMERICAN STATEMENTS ABOUT </p><p>\'FREEDOM\' AND \'DEMOCRACY\' ... THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO IMPOSE A </p><p>SETTLEMENT WITH ISRAELI CONDITIONS ON THE PALESTINIANS, SYRIA, </p><p>AND LEBANON.  ANYONE WHO DOES NOT ACCEPT THIS WILL FACE THE </p><p>MACHINES OF DESTRUCTION AND KILLING ALREADY EXISTING IN THE </p><p>REGION AND READY TO DISCIPLINE THOSE WHO DO NOT LEARN FROM THE </p><p>\'IRAQI LESSON\' ..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON BOTH SHEIKH ZAYED\'S AND PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>INITIATIVES FOR IRAQ, UAE COLUMNIST ABDULLA RASHEED WROTE IN ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" ON 4/7: </p><p> </p><p>"... SHEIKH ZAYED\'S INITIATIVE CAME FROM A MAN DEVOTED TO HIS </p><p>NATION AND THE ARAB WORLD, AND WHICH WAS FOR THE SAKE AND BENEFIT </p><p>OF ARABS.  HOWEVER, PRESIDENT BUSH\'S INITIATIVE LOOKS FIRST AND </p><p>FOREMOST AT U.S INTERESTS, WHICH IS NATURAL, AND THEN SHIFTS TO </p><p>OTHERS\' INTERESTS.  DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE TWO </p><p>INITIATIVES, SADDAM INSISTED ON CHOOSING PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>INITIATIVE TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS.  SO, PLEASE DON\'T BLAME US BUT </p><p>BLAME YOURSELVES ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENTING ON THE EXPECTED NEW AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IN IRAQ, </p><p>UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN WROTE IN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED </p><p>"AL BAYAN" ON 4/7: </p><p> </p><p>"... A RETIRED U.S. GENERAL (J.GARNER) WILL BE THE CIVIL RULER, </p><p>TOMMY FRANKS WILL BE THE MILITARY RULER, AND THERE WILL BE 13 </p><p>U.S. MINISTERS ASSISTED BY 4 CONSULTANTS FROM THE IRAQI </p><p>OPPOSITION!  ALLIES DON\'T MATTER WHEN IT\'S TIME TO EAT THE CAKE! </p><p>THIS IS THE SECRET BEHIND THE BRITISH INSISTENCE THAT IRAQIS </p><p>SHOULD CONTROL IRAQ AFTER THE WAR ... THE BAD TIMES ARE NOT HERE </p><p>YET, WHAT WE ARE FACING NOW IS STILL AN INTRODUCTION TO A GREEK </p><p>COMEDY.  IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS THE NEXT STEP OF THE </p><p>AMERICAN RIGHT WING WILL BE REVEALED, AND EVERYONE KNOWS THE NEXT </p><p>U.S. STEP.  IN THE COMING DAYS, THE U.S. WILL FLOOD THE WORLD </p><p>WITH IRAQI OIL IN ORDER TO REGAIN THE COSTS OF WAR AND TO RE- </p><p>BUILD IRAQ.  THE OIL PRODUCTION WILL EXCEED 5 OR EVEN 7 MILLION </p><p>BARRELS A DAY, AND PRICES WILL DECREASE AND MIGHT REACH 10 </p><p>DOLLARS PER BARREL!  WE SHOULD RECALL THE REMARKS MADE BY THE </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT GODFATHER, THE JEWISH HENRY KESSINGER IN 1973 </p><p>FOLLOWING THE OIL CRISIS: \'WE WILL MAKE ARABS DRINK THEIR OIL </p><p>JUST LIKE WATER!" </p><p> </p><p>5.  NOTING THE ARAB AND GULF COUNTRIES\' DOUBLE STANDARDS IN THEIR </p><p>MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE WAR AGAINST IRAQ, COLUMNIST DR. SHAMLAN AL </p><p>EISSA WROTE IN "AL ITTIHAD" ON 4/6: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE DILEMMA FACING THE ARAB WORLD AND GULF COUNTRIES IS THAT </p><p>THEY HAVE THE SAME FAULTS OF WHICH THEY ACCUSE THE U.S.  THESE </p><p>FAULTS ARE CLEARLY SHOWN IN THEIR DOUBLE STANDARDS.  EXAMPLES OF </p><p>THAT ARE MANY, WE MENTION HERE THE GULF MEDIA HOSTILE TOWARDS THE </p><p>U.S AND SUPPORTIVE OF IRAQ ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON U.S. EXCUSES FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ, "AL-KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 4/6: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S. PRESIDENT CLAIMS THAT ATTACKING IRAQ IS TO DEFEND </p><p>U.S. SECURITY AND WORLD PEACE.  THE FACT IS THAT THE RASH </p><p>POLICIES OF HIS ADMINISTRATION ARE WHAT BRINGS OUT HATRED TOWARDS </p><p>THE U.S., AND THIS POLICY IS WHAT THREATENS WORLD SECURITY AND </p><p>PEACE... " </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENTING ON FORMER CIA DIRECTOR JAMES WOOLSEY\'S WARNINGS TO </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA AND EGYPT FOR THE NEXT PHASE, COLUMNIST HOSSAM </p><p>KANAFANI WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" ON 4/6: </p><p> </p><p>"... PERHAPS THE STATEMENT OF THE FORMER CIA DIRECTOR, JAMES </p><p>WOOLSEY, TWO DAYS AGO, INDICATES U.S. INTENTIONS FOR THE REGION, </p><p>SINCE WELSEY IS NOMINATED TO BECOME MINISTER OF INFORMATION IN </p><p>THE POST-SADDAM AMERICAN GOVERNMENT ..." </p><p> </p><p>8.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "WHAT\'S COMING IS WORSE," UAE COLUMNIST </p><p>IBN AL DEIRA WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" ON 4/6: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE DEMOCRACY OF GENERAL GARNER THAT WILL BE COMING ON TANKS </p><p>AND OVER THE DEAD BODIES OF IRAQIS IS NOT THE DEMOCRACY THAT </p><p>IRAQIS HAVE BEEN DREAMING OF.  IRAQ HAS BEEN BAD DURING SADDAM\'S </p><p>REGIME BUT IT WILL BE WORSE DURING GARNERS ..." </p><p> </p><p>9.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "TROOPS HUMILIATING PROUD IRAQIS," MOHAMED </p><p>ALMEZEL, BAHRAIN BUREAU CHIEF FOR EXPATRIATE-ORIENTED ENGLISH </p><p>DAILY "GULF NEWS" WROTE AN ARTICLE ON 4/6 CRITICAL OF AMERICAN </p><p>AND BRITISH TROOPS TREATMEMT OF IRAQIS AT MILITARY CHECKPOINTS. </p><p>AL-MEZEL NOTED IRAQ\'S HISTORY AS A \'CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION\' AND </p><p>URGED COALITION FORCES TO RESPECT THE DIGNITY AND CULTURE OF </p><p>IRAQ.  AL-MEZEL LINKED AMERICAN ACTIONS IN IRAQ TO ISRAEL\'S </p><p>OCCUPATION OF THE PALESTINIANS, REFERRING TO AN AMERICAN SOLDIER </p><p>ARRESTING AN IRAQI AND TYING HIS HANDS WITH A PLASTIC CORD AS </p><p>"THE SAME TYPE USED BY ISRAELI SOLDIERS IN THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>OCCUPIED TERRITORIES." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
