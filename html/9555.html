<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001853 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, EAID, GT </p><p>SUBJECT:  AIDS Worker Escapes Kidnapping </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  Violence against human rights workers has </p><p>escalated in recent months and a group working to educate street </p><p>workers on the prevention and danger of HIV/AIDS has been the </p><p>most recent victim of such assaults.  There have been several </p><p>threats and acts of intimidation against workers of the </p><p>Organization to Support Integrated Sexuality Against AIDS </p><p>(OASIS) as a result of stigmatization and discrimination against </p><p>those of diverse sexual orientation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>--------------- </p><p>2.  (U)  An estimated 67,000 people (out of a population of 12 </p><p>million) in Guatemala are HIV positive, and approximately 5,619 </p><p>people have AIDS.  Seventy-three percent of these are male.  The </p><p>communities most at risk are homosexual males (11.5 percent), </p><p>followed by prostitutes (4.7 percent). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  OASIS is one of the only human rights groups in </p><p>Guatemala working with homosexual men and prostitutes in order </p><p>to curb HIV/AIDS infection rates among these high-risk </p><p>communities.  The organization originated ten years ago as part </p><p>of the Association for Integrated Health, and educates </p><p>homosexual men on prevention issues associated with the HIV </p><p>virus.  Approximately 100 people attend weekly meetings </p><p>concerning HIV prevention, mental health, self-esteem and other </p><p>health related topics.  Moreover, OASIS works with about 1,000 </p><p>prostitutes every month to prevent contraction of HIV and sells </p><p>condoms to them for a price of ten cents, about half the street </p><p>value of a condom. </p><p> </p><p>OASIS Director Receives Threats </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>4.  (U)  On July 10, POL Intern and ECON Intern met with Jorge </p><p>Lopez Sologaistoa, Executive Director of OASIS, who has become </p><p>another victim of the recent wave of human rights abuses </p><p>afflicting Guatemala.  He recounted that on the morning of May </p><p>13, 2003, two unarmed men kidnapped Lopez while he was walking </p><p>to his car.  One of the assailants forced him into the back of </p><p>the car, blindfolded him and restrained his head to constrict </p><p>his sight while the other man drove away from the scene.  Lopez </p><p>escaped during momentary confusion when his kidnappers nearly </p><p>collided with another car.  They did not pursue him on foot. </p><p>Lopez has also received repeated threats over the telephone. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Lopez wrote a full page complaint of the incident which </p><p>appeared in el Periodico on June 7.   The complaint advocated </p><p>human rights for all people regardless of economic condition, </p><p>gender, or sexual orientation.  Seventy-five other organizations </p><p>from seventeen countries signed onto the complaint expressing </p><p>their solidarity with OASIS\'s cause. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Lopez noted that acts of intimidation and other human </p><p>rights violations are frequent in his line of work.  He contends </p><p>that low ranking police officers are believed to be involved in </p><p>committing these acts.  He also believes that further acts of </p><p>aggression will occur, but that he will continue his work and </p><p>will not allow these actions to stop him from achieving the </p><p>goals and objectives of his organization. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>---------- </p><p>7.  (U)  The kidnapping attempt against Lopez, and the frequent </p><p>attacks against homosexuals, occur in a context of growing </p><p>violent crime affecting all Guatemalans, and an increase in </p><p>threats against human rights workers specifically.  Homosexuals </p><p>and those with AIDS are targets of violent discrimination due to </p><p>lack of education and awareness in some sectors of society.  We </p><p>will continue to monitor and report on this situation. </p><p></p></div>
