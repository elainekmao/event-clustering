SSH OBJECTIVE: SOCIAL ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  CRITERIA OBSERVED IN SELECTING THESE SSH PROJECTS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  IN SELECTING THE ABOVE SSH PROJECTS EMBASSY HAS CAREFULLY </p><p>CONSIDERED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THESE PROJECTS WILL BENEFIT, </p><p>THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THOSE REQUESTING THE </p><p>PROJECTS, AS WELL AS THEIR ABILITY TO COMPLETE THE PROJECTS. </p><p>THE MAJORITY OF THESE PROJECTS ARE AIMED AT IMPROVING </p><p>CONDITIONS FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN.  WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN INTO </p><p>CONSIDERATION THE NEED FOR LOCALLY PRODUCED FOOD THAT CAN </p><p>GENERATE INCOME AND RESULT IN FOOD SELF-SUFFICIENCY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  TWO PROPOSALS FROM OUTSIDE KINSHASA WERE INTRODUCED THIS </p><p>YEAR.  WE ACCEPTED BOTH OF THESE PROPOSALS, ONE IN BAS-CONGO </p><p>AND THE OTHER IN EQUATEUR.  THE MAJORITY OF THE PROPOSALS </p><p>COME FROM KINSHASA, HOWEVER, WHERE IT IS MUCH EASIER TO </p><p>ADMINISTER PROJECTS DUE TO THE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS OUTSIDE OF </p><p>THE CAPITAL CITY.  KINSHASA, WITH ITS GROWING POPULATION OF </p><p>OVER SIX MILLION PEOPLE, HAS AN IMMENSE NEED FOR SMALL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  OUR SEVEN PROJECTS ARE A DROP IN THE </p><p>BUCKET, BUT WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD IMPROVING THE LIVING </p><p>CONDITIONS OF THE APPLICANTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE POPULATION OF THE DRC IS ESTIMATED AT OVER 50 MILLION </p><p>PEOPLE.  THE POPULATION OF KINSHASA, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>THE EMBASSY\'S SSH PROJECTS ARE LOCATED, IS SAID TO BE </p><p>APPROXIMATELY SIX MILLION.  POST\'S MISSION PROGRAM PLAN NOTES </p><p>THE STRONG US NATIONAL INTEREST IN PURSUING HUMANITARIAN </p><p>GOALS IN THE DRC, AND THESE SELF HELP PROJECTS WILL PROMOTE </p><p>THAT US INTEREST.  USAID HAS A PRESENCE IN THE DRC.  THE </p><p>PEACE CORPS DOES NOT HAVE A PRESENCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  PREVIOUS POST ADMINISTRATION PERFORMANCE: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  FY00.  FUNDING FOR FY2000 HAS NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED </p><p>(NEITHER BY THE EMBASSY, NOR BY THE PROJECT RECIPIENTS.) </p><p>CONTRACTS FOR 2000 PROJECTS WERE SIGNED ON SEPTEMBER 22, </p><p>2000.  DUE TO LOCAL BANKING RESTRICTIONS, WE PLAN TO PAY </p><p>VENDORS DIRECTLY FOR MATERIALS AND/OR SERVICES NEEDED IN </p><p>ORDER TO COMPLETE THEIR PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  FY99.  DUE TO LOCAL BANKING RESTRICTIONS, FUNDS ALLOCATED </p><p>FOR THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN SLOW IN GETTING TO THE </p><p>RECIPIENTS.  CONTRACTS FOR ALL 1999 PROJECTS HAVE BEEN </p><p>EXTENDED AND RECEIPTS ARE COMING IN.  ONE OF OUR RECIPIENTS </p><p>HAS NOT RECEIVED ITS FUNDS.  HOWEVER, WE ARE CORRESPONDING </p><p>WITH USAID CONCERNING THIS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FY98.  NO FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED DUE TO THE WAR AND THE </p><p>EVACUATION OF THE EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FY97.  TEN OF THE ELEVEN AGREEMENTS WERE LIQUIDATED. WE HAVE </p><p>WORKED HARD TO CLOSE OUT THESE PROJECTS, AND ARE PLEASED TO </p><p>REPORT THAT WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO USAID ALL THE DOCUMENTS </p><p>NECESSARY TO LIQUIDATE THE ONE REMAINING PROJECT.  ALL </p><p>AGREEMENTS PRIOR TO 1999 HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND WE </p><p>ANTICIPATE A FAVORABLE REPORT FROM USAID. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
