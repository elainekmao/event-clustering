<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000632 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PGOV, PINS, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: SECURITY INCIDENTS IN RUN-UP TO NEPAL BANDH </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 604 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 592 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ARSO H.E. REX, REASONS 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) A bomb exploded in the middle of a small bridge west </p><p>of Kathmandu\'s historic Durbar Square March 29 at </p><p>approximately 8:45 a.m.  At least 26 people were injured in </p><p>the blast, including four school children who were transiting </p><p>the area, two of whom sustained serious injuries.  There were </p><p>no fatalities.  No Americans were injured, and the area is </p><p>not frequented by foreign tourists.  The bridge itself </p><p>sustained only minor damage and was reopened by noon. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Tankeswori is a narrow two-lane bridge over the </p><p>Bishnumati River between Hanumandkocha and Tachachal.  At </p><p>that hour, the bridge is normally crowded with vendors, </p><p>shoppers, pedestrians, and vehicles.  According to witnesses, </p><p>a few people on the bridge noticed a bundle of cloth lying on </p><p>the footpath that raised suspicion.  As the bystanders talked </p><p>amongst themselves, three army personnel who were passing </p><p>through the area in plain clothes overheard them, and began </p><p>to clear the area.  Soon thereafter, the explosive device </p><p>detonated.  According to police and RNA sources, the </p><p>explosive was apparently in an empty paint can that had been </p><p>placed next to a larger, similar container holding bricks and </p><p>nails.  Authorities suspect that the blast was triggered by a </p><p>timer or possibly by remote control.  Police have taken one </p><p>person into custody. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment:  Unlike most of the explosive devices used </p><p>by the Maoists in crowded areas of Kathmandu, this device </p><p>appears to have been designed to spray shrapnel and cause </p><p>casualties.  Many previous "banner bombs" were simply wrapped </p><p>in cloth or paper and designed to make noise. We suspect the </p><p>explosion to be part of the Maoists\' continuing campaign to </p><p>terrorize the population into supporting the general strike </p><p>they have called for April 2-6 (reftels).  The Embassy will </p><p>hold an EAC meeting the morning of April 1 to assess the </p><p>security situation. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
