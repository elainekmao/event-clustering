<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003009 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, May 21, focuses </p><p>preparations for the Jordanian parliamentary elections </p><p>as the candidate registration for the elections closed </p><p>at 821 candidates yesterday.  Papers also highlight </p><p>America\'s warning of continued threats in Saudi </p><p>Arabia.  Majority of editorial commentary focus on the </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Operations here and there" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/21):  "There is a strange coincidence of time </p><p>between two phenomena that have never coincided </p><p>before: the wave of operations in the West Bank and </p><p>Gaza and Israel, and the wave of Al-Qa\'eda operations </p><p>in Riyadh and Casablanca..  It is a purely </p><p>circumstantial coincidence of timing, nothing more and </p><p>nothing less.  Yet, this coincidence carries with some </p><p>disturbing indications, namely that it can be employed </p><p>to better serve Israel\'s objective of `Talbanizing\' </p><p>the Palestinian Authority, of linking the Palestinian </p><p>struggle with international terrorism, and of turning </p><p>Israel\'s racist-based aggression and colonization into </p><p>another chapter of the legitimate international war </p><p>against terrorism..  Once again, the recent wave of </p><p>operations in Palestine and the Arab world shows that </p><p>combating violence, terrorism and extremism and </p><p>containing the anti-peace movement cannot be achieved </p><p>by military and security means alone, rather by </p><p>addressing the faults, namely the occupation, the </p><p>oppression, the frustration and the desperation." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
