<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002737 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PTER, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT "WORLD MUST FIGHT TERRORISM"; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "World must fight terrorism" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated its </p><p>      November 30 editorial to calling for "a united front </p><p>      against terrorism" and urged world leaders to "desist from </p><p>      harboring terrorist groups."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Terrorism whatever its motive is </p><p>      unacceptable. . .On Thursday suicide bombers blew up </p><p>      a hotel full of Israelis in Kenya killing 14 people </p><p>      minutes after missiles narrowly missed an Israeli </p><p>      airliner taking off nearby.  The attacks appear to </p><p>      have been well orchestrated and synchronized by the </p><p>      forces of evil.  Although a group that calls itself </p><p>      `Army of Palestine\' sent a claim of responsibility, </p><p>      Israel and Kenyan authorities reportedly blamed the </p><p>      al Qaeda network largely accused of the 11 September </p><p>      2001 bombings in the United States for the attack. </p><p>      It is however our hope that the authorities will </p><p>      institute thorough investigations into this matter </p><p>      and bring those behind the heinous act to book.  We </p><p>      are basically saying no to terrorism regardless of </p><p>      where it is happening in the global village. </p><p>      Terrorists have to be tracked down and killed as </p><p>      banditry of any nature causes unnecessary human </p><p>      suffering and retards development.  A united front </p><p>      against terrorism has to be forged if the cancer is </p><p>      to be nipped in the bud.  World leaders should </p><p>      desist from harboring terrorists groups in their </p><p>      countries as this helps them to flourish and spread </p><p>      their tentacles.  While this ugly incident was </p><p>      taking place in Kenya another bomb was exploding in </p><p>      South Africa at the Mtamvuma Bridge. . .These </p><p>      terrorist activities have left many people in the </p><p>      sub-region who watched the movie-style attack on the </p><p>      U. S. unsettled.  It is now clear that all of us are </p><p>      vulnerable to attack by terrorists and should thus </p><p>      prepare for any eventuality. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
