(U) The Jordanian Intellectual Property Association </p><p>(JIPA) announced at a June 25 fund-raising breakfast plans </p><p>for its upcoming Intellectual Property Week (IP Week) to be </p><p>held in Amman, Jordan on August 11-14, 2003.  The weeklong </p><p>workshop is the first of its kind in the region and JIPA </p><p>hopes to make it an annual event.  Amongst other donors, </p><p>the USAID-funded AMIR program financed the launch event. </p><p>In addition to providing programmatic details, IP Week </p><p>organizers solicited participants to sponsor events during </p><p>the conference. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Academics, policy-makers, and industry leaders will </p><p>gather at IP Week to address a variety of issues including: </p><p>protection and enforcement; intellectual assets as a </p><p>vehicle for economic growth and business expansion; </p><p>knowledge management; compliance with international trade </p><p>treaties.  Invited speakers include Jordanian government </p><p>officials, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, World </p><p>Intellectual Property Organization, USAID, and the </p><p>International Intellectual Property Institute. IP Week will </p><p>also showcase the key sectors of audiovisual products, </p><p>anti-counterfeiting, books and publications, information </p><p>technology and pharmaceuticals by holding a sideline </p><p>exhibition of products and services. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) A brainchild of JIPA chairman Murad Bushnaq, IP </p><p>week should serve to highlight Jordan\'s place at the front </p><p>of the regional pack in the IPR protection arena.  The </p><p>event, which will build on the buzz created by the World </p><p>Economic Forum Extraordinary Meeting at the Dead Sea June </p><p>21-23 (reported septels), may also signal to potential </p><p>investors in IP-sensitive sectors that Jordan can provide a </p><p>hospitable investment and operating environment. </p><p>Organizers at the June 25 breakfast said they were already </p><p>receiving expressions of interest from companies throughout </p><p>the region, Europe, and the U.S., and expected a strong </p><p>turnout for IP Week events. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
