<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000369 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CJAN, EAGR, KTIA, PGOV, PHUM, SNAR, CFED, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSODOR,S MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>GUTIERREZ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB JOHN R. HAMILTON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Over lunch at the residence February 10, the </p><p>Ambassador gave FM Gutierrez a heads up that we are actively </p><p>working on specific benchmarks for re-certification; pressed </p><p>him on Article 98, extradition, Belize-Guatemala, election </p><p>observation, the proposal to investigate clandestine groups, </p><p>and delays in the Mediterranean fruit fly program (Moscamed). </p><p> Gutierrez was generally forthcoming in most areas; whether </p><p>he can bring his government along remains to be seen.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>Belize-Guatemala: </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DCM accompanied the Ambassador; Gutierrez came alone. </p><p>He had just returned from Washington, where he had signed a </p><p>protocol for continuing a regime of confidence building </p><p>measures with his Belizean counterpart, Assad Shoman, with </p><p>OAS Secretary General Gaviria and Deputy SecGen Einaudi </p><p>looking on.  Einaudi had been critical in getting the </p><p>Belizeans to closure, Gutierrez said.  He felt that he would </p><p>be able to develop a good relationship with Shoman, whom he </p><p>intended to visit in Belize after the March elections there. </p><p>He is also taking a proposal to Panama (for the Central </p><p>American summit with Colombia) to include Belize in certain </p><p>Central American integration activities.  He was not (at all) </p><p>encouraging about post-November, Guatemalan election interest </p><p>in the facilitators, recommendations, voicing again what we </p><p>have heard here, that it would have been easier for Guatemala </p><p>to accept the results of international arbitration than the </p><p>facilitators, recommendations.  He in effect shrugged when </p><p>the Ambassador pointed out that the &recommendations8 had </p><p>in fact been negotiated with the MFA (under his predecessor, </p><p>Gabriel Orellana) and that the Guatemalans discovered the </p><p>defects in process pretty late in the game.  He suggested </p><p>that Orellana had failed to keep the government informed, had </p><p>not consulted the &Council of Belize8 (of notables, set up </p><p>under the Arzu government to advise on matters Belizean) and </p><p>that Vice President Reyes Lopez had been horrified when he </p><p>saw what Orellana had agreed to. </p><p> </p><p>OAS Resolution on Colombia Bombing: </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>3. (C) Gutierrez said President Uribe had phoned President </p><p>Portillo over the weekend, seeking Guatemalan support for a </p><p>strong OAS resolution.   Briefed by Portillo, who had </p><p>immediately sat down to draft a statement of support that the </p><p>Central American presidents might make when they meet </p><p>February 11 with Uribe in Panama, Gutierrez said he had </p><p>cautioned Portillo that Guatemala needed to consider any </p><p>resolution carefully, think it all the way through.  He </p><p>clarified, when the Ambassador asked what there is to think </p><p>about when a bomb kills 32 civilians, that Guatemala will </p><p>support a forceful condemnation of terrorism, but that he </p><p>thinks Uribe may be after much more than that and his </p><p>instincts will be to be cautious. </p><p> </p><p>Narcotics: </p><p>------------ </p><p>4. (C) Gutierrez was apologetic that President Portillo had </p><p>surfaced, in the press this morning and in a tendentious </p><p>manner, a proposal that he had intended to broach at the </p><p>lunch, namely that the U.S. engage Guatemala in a much more </p><p>robust program of port security.  Portillo had said that the </p><p>GOG would be proposing, through the Ambassador, that the U.S. </p><p>take over and run the ports, "with Guatemalan authorities" </p><p>(the only caveat), and  "we,ll see then if drug control is </p><p>any better."  The Ambassador said we will be continuing our </p><p>technical assistance on port security but that running </p><p>foreign ports is not in our portfolio.  If the GOG wants to </p><p>think in ambitious terms, however, it might consider putting </p><p>out for bid a long-term concession to run the ports, both in </p><p>the interest of overall efficiency and good management and in </p><p>the interest of narcotics control.  Gutierrez returned to the </p><p>subject at the end of the lunch, saying he would raise it </p><p>with Portillo. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador advised that the Washington </p><p>inter-agency community is engaged in developing benchmarks </p><p>for re-certification and that he hoped to have them in hand </p><p>before the Embassy,s next ministerial level meeting with his </p><p>government, February 21. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Guatemala has contracted the Greenberg-Taurig law </p><p>firm, of Washington, which has hired former WHA Assistant </p><p>Secretary Peter Romero, to assist it on re-certification. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>(The Ambassador met with Greenberg Taurig attorney Ruth </p><p>Espey-Romero and Romero on February 7, outlining what we see </p><p>as the problem areas; Romero out-briefed the Ambassador </p><p>February 10 on his meetings with the government, saying that </p><p>he had emphasized only a strong anti-drug performance would </p><p>sell in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>Extradition: </p><p>-------------- </p><p>7. (C)  Gutierrez claimed that the presidential authorization </p><p>in the Castillo extradition is only one or two signatures </p><p>away from being complete.  He reluctantly agreed to provide </p><p>us a copy of it when we questioned if the authorization would </p><p>come free and clear of conditions with which we could not </p><p>comply.  (We suspect it does and will advise when we get it.) </p><p> He warned that the authorization goes as far as Guatemala </p><p>can go. </p><p>Elections: </p><p>------------ </p><p>8. (C) Gutierrez says that the Government will be issuing </p><p>invitations to the international community in general (he </p><p>mentioned EU, UN and OAS in particular) to observe </p><p>Guatemala,s November elections.  He needs to coordinate </p><p>further with Guatemala,s elections tribunal before issuing </p><p>the invitations, but does not anticipate problems.  He hopes </p><p>that elections missions could be on the ground, at least with </p><p>a minimum presence, by mid-year. </p><p> </p><p>Clandestine Group Commission: </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>9. (C) Gutierrez gave the Ambassador a heads up that the </p><p>government of Guatemala would be asking for declassification </p><p>of USG classified holdings on this subject.  The Ambassador </p><p>reviewed our support for the proposal but warned against a </p><p>strategy of transferring responsibility for the Commission,s </p><p>success to the U.S.  Gutierrez protested that that was not </p><p>the idea; he recalled that the vast majority of information </p><p>received by the Historical Clarification Commission (Truth </p><p>Commission) had come from Guatemalans (victims and individual </p><p>military officers), but that the little that the U.S. had </p><p>provided had been valuable in cross-checking and verifying </p><p>Guatemalan sources.  The Ambassador said we will see how we </p><p>can be helpful but left a marker that declassification was </p><p>not necessarily in the cards. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Gutierrez said that Peace Secretary Catalina </p><p>Soberanis would be the GOG point person on the Clandestine </p><p>Commission proposal.  She is currently ill, however, which </p><p>leaves him to work this week with Human Rights Watch </p><p>executive Jose Miguel Vivanco.  The government has invited </p><p>Vivanco to act as &facilitator8 in reaching agreement on </p><p>the Commission,s mandate and structure.  Noting that the </p><p>Guatemalan human rights community had complained that the </p><p>Government has not yet responded to the human rights </p><p>ombudsman directly, Gutierrez said the problem was that the </p><p>ombudsman launched the proposal publicly but never sent the </p><p>proposal to the government.  A reply to the proposal was </p><p>already drafted for whenever this oversight was corrected. </p><p>Gutierrez also mentioned the government,s interest in not </p><p>limiting the commission,s mandate to the period since 1996 </p><p>(note:  putting some practical limits on the commission,s </p><p>mandate was a U.S. suggestion). </p><p> </p><p>Article 98: </p><p>------------- </p><p>11. (C) We briefed Gutierrez extensively on the issue.  He is </p><p>aware of it, had assumed that Guatemalan not being a </p><p>signatory to the Rome Treaty would deal with our concern and </p><p>was disappointed to learn it will not.  He also had not </p><p>understood that the ICC can exercise jurisdiction over </p><p>citizens whose state is not a treaty signatory.  Upshot was </p><p>that he promised to give the issue more attention. </p><p> </p><p>Moscamed program: </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>12. (C) We briefed Gutierrez on problems we are having with </p><p>the Ministries of Agriculture and Environment in moving ahead </p><p>with this year,s spraying program (whose season is </p><p>determined by the biological cycle of the Med fruit fly).  We </p><p>also alerted him that USDA/APHIS might raise the issue with </p><p>Ambassador Arenales in Washington.  He offered to speak to </p><p>both ministers. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>------------- </p><p>13. (C)   This meeting covered a lot of ground.  Gutierrez is </p><p>an easy and responsive interlocutor who conveys a </p><p>well-meaning persona.  Not an FRG member, we\'ll see how much </p><p>influence he has within this FRG government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
