<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000916 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, Human Rights, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: REGIME RELEASES 32 POLITICAL PRISONERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 613 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA PRISCILLA A. CLAPP FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  The regime announced yesterday that it </p><p>had released 32 political prisoners; 14 NLD members and 18 </p><p>others, mostly students.  The NLD was told of only 24 </p><p>releases, its 14 members and 10 students the regime said were </p><p>arrested for supporting NLD activities.  Despite the </p><p>discrepancy in reporting, the NLD hopes these releases </p><p>presage more significant releases of NLD members and students </p><p>in conjunction with the upcoming visit of Special Envoy </p><p>Razali and others. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The regime announced the release of 32 political </p><p>prisoners yesterday (7/28); 14 NLD members and 18 others. </p><p>Following its normal procedure, the regime faxed a brief </p><p>statement from its spokesperson to selected &friendly8 </p><p>embassies (the U.S. is not among them) and local press </p><p>representatives.  The statement provided just the names of </p><p>those released and stated that they had been returned to </p><p>their families from various correctional facilities and were </p><p>&resting comfortably.8   This was the largest single </p><p>release of prisoners by the regime since talks with NLD </p><p>General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi began in December 1999. </p><p>None of the 14 NLD prisoners were senior or prominent </p><p>officials although two were township level leaders before </p><p>their arrests.  Most of the non-NLD prisoners were students </p><p>who were arrested along with NLD members but were not </p><p>registered party members. </p><p> </p><p>NLD notified of only 24 releases..... </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Visiting NLD headquarters to obtain their views on </p><p>the releases, Poloff was told that NLD Secretary U Lwin had </p><p>received a call from Military Intelligence (MI) alerting him </p><p>only to the release of 14 NLD members and 10 students who </p><p>were arrested with NLD members.  MI did not mention the other </p><p>eight releases which the regime had announced to others.  U </p><p>Lwin did not have any explanation for the discrepancy. </p><p>(Note:  The difference in the method the regime notified the </p><p>NLD and the press and the differences in the numbers provided </p><p>is just one example of how carefully the regime continues to </p><p>attempt to control information.  Perhaps the regime did not </p><p>provide eight of the names to the NLD because the prisoners </p><p>were not affiliated with the NLD, although their releases </p><p>were certainly a result of NLD efforts.  As usual, however, </p><p>the regime provided no explanation for its actions. End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  This discrepancy in numbers aside, U Lwin was </p><p>pleased with the releases, noting that although no </p><p>significant NLD leaders were released the number of prisoners </p><p>released is much higher than the five to ten prisoners the </p><p>regime has been releasing periodically since the talks began. </p><p> He said he believes the releases are an effort to </p><p>demonstrate political progress prior to upcoming visits to </p><p>Burma by UN Special Envoy Razali (8/2), Japanese Foreign </p><p>Minister Kawaguchi (8/3), and Malaysian Prime Minister </p><p>Mahathir (8/18). </p><p> </p><p>More releases imminent? </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  This release of 14 NLD members brings the total </p><p>number of remaining NLD prisoners down to 261, according to U </p><p>Lwin.  He said that he is hopeful that the regime will </p><p>&clean the slate8 and release the remaining prisoners in </p><p>conjunction with Special Envoy Razali,s visit.  This is a </p><p>necessary and long overdue action which would pave the way </p><p>for progress on dialogue, he said. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  U Lwin was also pleased that the regime included </p><p>student activists in these releases.  He said the NLD has no </p><p>estimate of the number of these activists remaining in prison </p><p>but there are many.  Many of these students, he explained, </p><p>were arrested for participating in NLD rallies when they were </p><p>quite young and had little understanding of the consequences </p><p>of their actions.  Some who are still in prison were arrested </p><p>as long ago as 1989, according to U Lwin.  He and Vice </p><p>Chairman U Tin Oo expressed hope that yesterday,s releases </p><p>are a harbinger of more student releases in the near future. </p><p>7. (SBU)  Discussing the total number of remaining political </p><p>prisoners, U Lwin said the NLD does not know how many non-NLD </p><p>ethnic political prisoners exist in addition to the student </p><p>activists.  He said the number of Karen, Shan, and other </p><p>ethnic political prisoners could be substantial, especially </p><p>near the border areas.  (Note:  This explains in part at </p><p>least the continuing inconsistent estimates of political </p><p>prisoners by Amnesty International, ICRC, and others. End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Clapp </p><p></p></div>
