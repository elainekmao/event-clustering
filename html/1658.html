(SBU) SUMMARY.  VIETNAM HAS RAISED THE DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>BURMA BEFORE, AND INTENDS TO DO SO AGAIN AT THE APRIL 30 </p><p>ASEAN MINISTERIAL IN RANGOON, BUT "IN OUR OWN WAY."  AN MFA </p><p>OFFICER PRAISED THE "SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS" THAT HAS BEEN </p><p>MADE IN THE TALKS ALREADY.  OUR POINTS WILL BE PASSED TO FM </p><p>NIEN, HEADING THE VIETNAMESE DELEGATION TO RANGOON, AS WERE </p><p>SIMILAR POINTS MADE EARLIER BY A DELEGATION OF EU EMBASSIES </p><p>LED BY SWEDEN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. AND EU POINTS TO BE SHARED WITH FM NIEN </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) POLOFF PRESENTED REFTEL POINTS ON BURMA DIALOGUE TO </p><p>TRAN DUC BINH OF THE MFA ASEAN DEPARTMENT APRIL 27.  BINH </p><p>WILL BE A MEMBER OF VIETNAM\'S FIVE-PERSON DELEGATION TO THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01010  271118Z </p><p>APRIL 30 RANGOON ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING.  FM NGUYEN </p><p>DY NIEN WILL LEAD THE DELEGATION.  BINH SAID THAT AN EU </p><p>DELEGATION LED BY THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR HAD OFFERED SIMILAR </p><p>POINTS TO THE ASEAN DEPARTMENT TWO DAYS EARLIER.  HE </p><p>PROMISED TO PASS OUR POINTS TO NIEN, AS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY </p><p>PASSED ON THE EU\'S POINTS. </p><p> </p><p>RAISING THE DIALOGUE "IN OUR OWN WAY" </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO BINH, VIETNAM WILL RAISE THE DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH THE BURMESE DURING THE APRIL 30 MINISTERIAL, BUT "IN </p><p>OUR OWN WAY."  HE EXPLAINED THAT VIETNAM HAD ALREADY </p><p>EXPRESSED ITS INTEREST IN THE DIALOGUE, BUT IS LIMITED IN </p><p>WHAT IT CAN SAY BECAUSE OF VIETNAM\'S AND ASEAN\'S POLICIES OF </p><p>NON-INTERFERENCE INTO THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>VIETNAM SEES "SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ALREADY" </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) BINH SAID THAT FROM VIETNAM\'S PERSPECTIVE, THERE </p><p>HAS BEEN "SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS" IN THE TALKS ALREADY. </p><p>DURING LAST MONTH\'S ASEAN MEETING IN HCMC, THE BURMESE </p><p>DELEGATION BRIEFED THE OTHER ATTENDEES ON THE DIALOGUE. </p><p>BINH NOTED THAT THE BURMESE DID NOT GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT THE </p><p>DIALOGUE AT THAT TIME BECAUSE "MANY OF THE DETAILS ARE BEING </p><p>KEPT SECRET."  NEVERTHELESS, HE SAID, VIETNAM\'S IMPRESSION </p><p>IS THAT "BOTH SIDES ARE SATISFIED THAT THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>PROGRESS."  POLOFF REITERATED THAT OUR IMPRESSION, ON THE </p><p>CONTRARY, IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE PROGRESS OF LATE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01010  271118Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) BINH SAID THAT THE VIETNAMESE DELEGATION LOOKED </p><p>FORWARD TO SEEING THE SITUATION IN BURMA FIRST HAND, BUT </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT NIEN AND HIS DELEGATION WOULD BE THERE FOR </p><p>ONLY ONE DAY BEFORE RETURNING TO HANOI, WHERE NIEN WILL BE </p><p>RECEIVING PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF OF PAKISTAN.  HE SAID THE </p><p>GROUP WOULD BE BRIEFED ON THE DIALOGUE.  BINH REITERATED </p><p>VIETNAM\'S SUPPORT OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: ENCOURAGING THAT VIETNAM WOULD RAISE THE MATTER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) COMMENT: IT IS ENCOURAGING THAT VIETNAM HAS RAISED </p><p>THE MATTER OF THE DIALOGUE WITH BURMA, AND WILL DO SO AGAIN, </p><p>IF ONLY "IN OUR OWN WAY."  IT IS UNUSUAL FOR VIETNAM TO </p><p>RAISE SUCH MATTERS AT ALL WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY </p><p>ASEAN PARTNERS, IN LIGHT OF ITS OWN STEADFAST ADHERENCE TO A </p><p>POLICY OF "NON-INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS."  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
