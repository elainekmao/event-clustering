<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000301 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  STRONG GVN REACTION TO VIRGINIA FLAG BILL </p><p> </p><p>REF: Hanoi 288 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Senior Vice Foreign Minister (VFM) Nguyen Dinh </p><p>Bin told Ambassador on Sunday, February 9 that the Virginia </p><p>House of Delegates\' Bill (HB 2829) on displaying the flag of </p><p>the former Republic of Vietnam is a "wrongdoing that has </p><p>upset the GVN, the National Assembly, and the people of </p><p>Vietnam."  Passage by the Virginia State Senate would "set a </p><p>very dangerous precedent" and "jeopardize the bilateral </p><p>relationship," he claimed.  VFM Bin also noted that mass </p><p>organizations, such as the Vietnam-U.S. Friendship Society, </p><p>are "mobilizing" against the bill. (Note:  As of February </p><p>10, that Society, the Veterans Association, and the Vietnam </p><p>Fatherland Front have already issued well-publicized </p><p>denunciations of the bill.  End note) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  VFM Bin, expanding on Assistant Foreign Minister </p><p>Nguyen Duc Hung\'s remarks at a meeting with Charge on </p><p>February 6 (reftel), said that the GVN\'s senior leadership </p><p>was following the matter with "great concern."  VFM Bin said </p><p>that the GVN "appreciated" Deputy Secretary Armitage\'s </p><p>recent letter to the Virginia legislative officials opposing </p><p>the bill, viewing it as a "positive step." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  VFM Binh added that due to the "seriousness and </p><p>urgency" of the matter, the GVN requested that the </p><p>Ambassador relay to Washington the "feelings and concern of </p><p>the GVN and the Vietnamese people." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The Ambassador told Bin that he would relay the </p><p>GVN\'s concerns, which are already "well-known in </p><p>Washington."  He reminded VFM Bin that the Virginia Senate </p><p>had not passed the bill.  The Ambassador explained to Bin </p><p>that, under the federal system, states have considerable </p><p>autonomy.  However, if states venture into the foreign </p><p>policy arena, the federal government can and does challenge </p><p>them in court. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The Ambassador cautioned VFM Bin against </p><p>overreaction to the bill, noting that a strong GVN reaction </p><p>could have the unintended effect of encouraging similar </p><p>legislation in other states with large Vietnamese-American </p><p>populations, such as Texas and California.  He noted that </p><p>legislation perceived as anti-GVN is usually brought forward </p><p>by legislators representing constituencies with large </p><p>Vietnamese-American populations.  The Ambassador urged </p><p>restraint, noting that the best long-term solution is for </p><p>the GVN to develop a more creative strategy for </p><p>reconciliation with the overseas Vietnamese community, many </p><p>of whom feel alienated from the GVN.  The Ambassador </p><p>affirmed that on his trips back to Washington, he meets with </p><p>Vietnamese-American groups in northern Virginia and </p><p>elsewhere, explains that there have been many changes in </p><p>Vietnam, and encourages them to visit.  In those efforts, </p><p>the Ambassador commented, "I am doing your job" and he </p><p>observed very little similar effort by the GVN embassy to </p><p>seek understanding with overseas Vietnamese communities. </p><p>The Ambassador also noted that suggestions we have made for </p><p>improving ties with the Vietnamese community in the U.S. </p><p>have been ignored, such as allowing family members access to </p><p>the Army of the Republic of Vietnam cemetery in Bien Hoa. </p><p>"If you defile the graves of peoples\' ancestors, don\'t be </p><p>surprised if the descendants are still hostile," he noted. </p><p>Summing up the history of the GVN\'s failure to pursue a </p><p>policy of "reconciliation and concord," the Ambassador said </p><p>that it is now "reaping what it had sown." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  In response, VFM Bin said that he "understood </p><p>well" the US legal system, but affirmed that it is important </p><p>to deal with this "emerging" problem in "all its aspects." </p><p>If the US Administration explained all the "negative </p><p>implications" of this bill to the Virginia legislature, the </p><p>bill would probably not pass, he claimed.  He denied that </p><p>the GVN was overreacting, noting that the bill, if passed, </p><p>would "hurt the most sacred feelings of the Vietnamese </p><p>people." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Concerning reconciliation, VFM Bin (the MFA </p><p>official directly responsible for liaison with the overseas </p><p>Vietnamese community) said that GVN policy in this area </p><p>reflected the "tolerance of the Vietnamese people."  Despite </p><p>the fact that "many overseas Vietnamese have tried to harm </p><p>us in the past, we allow them to return to their country.  I </p><p>do not think that there is any other country as tolerant as </p><p>Vietnam," Bin claimed. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)   Separately, the MFA spokeswoman on February 7 said </p><p>that "Vietnam vehemently demands that the Government and </p><p>Congress of Virginia State take immediate measures to revoke </p><p>such a wrongful bill."  Her remarks were widely reported by </p><p>the state media. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
