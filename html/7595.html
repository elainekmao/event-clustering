<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000727 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, SOCI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA ELECTIONS -- THE VIEW FROM THE QUEUE </p><p> </p><p>1.  Winding down Shehu Shagari Way in Abuja to an AP </p><p>station opposite the Hilton is a fuel queue that </p><p>varies between 300 and 1700 meters.  Motorists favor </p><p>this queue because the AP station often has fuel and </p><p>because the gentle slope of the final 900 meters means </p><p>no need to start engines.  On Monday evening, the </p><p>queue was just under one kilometer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  DCM stopped at every fourth vehicle where the </p><p>driver was outside to solicit views on the April 19 </p><p>elections.  Of 43 persons polled, just five preferred </p><p>not to comment.  The other 38 overwhelmingly commended </p><p>the peaceful conduct of voting, in some cases </p><p>expressing relief that things had gone as well as they </p><p>had.  Relatively few (about a dozen) volunteered </p><p>unease or unhappiness about electoral malfeasance. </p><p>These included the most voluble interlocutors; just </p><p>four called the process "bad," however.  Only one </p><p>person mentioned the name of any of the major </p><p>candidates, and that was to call President Obasanjo by </p><p>his nickname, Baba.  Another said he would have voted </p><p>ANPP if Rochas Okorocha had been that party\'s </p><p>candidate, but he had voted PDP since Rochas was not a </p><p>candidate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  A plurality of those interviewed offered that God </p><p>decided who would govern Nigeria.  God did not make </p><p>mistakes, and so the person declared the winner was </p><p>God\'s choice.  They would now pray that the chosen </p><p>leader would do the right thing.  A major (if obvious) </p><p>concern for those in the queue was that the leader </p><p>address fuel shortages. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT: The people in the fuel queue represent a </p><p>cross-section of "ordinary Nigerians" living in Abuja. </p><p>They do not have access to special fuel supplies and </p><p>are not rich enough to hire someone else to stand in </p><p>for them (however, a number were drivers for people </p><p>wealthy enough to hire them).  The almost overwhelming </p><p>emphasis on the importance of peaceful elections </p><p>(virtually everyone willing to talk mentioned it) was </p><p>remarkable, and it suggests that calls for "mass </p><p>action" to protest questionable results that heavily </p><p>favor the PDP may not resonate to the extent that some </p><p>in the opposition would like.  The conviction that God </p><p>would make the right choice for Nigeria should </p><p>surprise no one familiar with the centrality of faith </p><p>to Nigerian society.  For them, whether the elections </p><p>represent the "will of the Nigerian people" matters </p><p>little, for the will of God is self-evident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT CONTINUED: Those most inclined to voice </p><p>detailed objections to the conduct or results of the </p><p>elections were from the Southeast.  Northern Muslims </p><p>particularly tended to express faith in God and </p><p>submission to His will, though one said several times </p><p>that the elections were "bad" but declined to say much </p><p>more.  Two people from the Southwest expressed at </p><p>least a measure of unhappiness with the AD\'s downfall, </p><p>but the rest appeared not to care.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  NOTE:  The percentage of Muslims among those </p><p>sampled may have been reduced somewhat by the timing </p><p>of the survey, which took place during a period that </p><p>included two prayer times; DCM did not address those </p><p>who were praying or preparing to do so. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
