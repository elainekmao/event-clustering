<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001697 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PDA (JGREENBLATT); WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IMMUNITIES, JULY 16, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" on </p><p>7/16 entitled "No way of winning". "Let\'s see how things work in </p><p>Honduras: if the Honduran politicians don\'t put the ball through </p><p>the basket they lose, and if they do it they lose too. A group of </p><p>Congressmen got together after receiving a great deal of </p><p>criticism, and in a moment of despair or irritation they decided </p><p>to take away immunities from everybody. It\'s worth to point out </p><p>that this has just been an announcement, there\'s nothing official </p><p>yet, but as usual the decision making in Honduras is like a </p><p>pendulum, moving back and forth." </p><p> </p><p>"This has been the case on the issue of immunities. The </p><p>Constitution includes a broad definition of it, pretending to </p><p>embrace everything, but it has resulted on a continuous abuse of </p><p>this privilege, until the bubble burst. Once it burst, they </p><p>decided to take an extreme measure: eliminate immunities for </p><p>everybody." </p><p> </p><p>"We believe it\'s necessary to limit immunities exclusively to </p><p>perform the duties of key public officials. It shouldn\'t be too </p><p>broad to protect civil servants from civil lawsuits or criminal </p><p>prosecution." </p><p> </p><p>2. Article in San Pedro Sula-based daily "Tiempo" on 7/16 </p><p>entitled "The elimination of immunity will only benefit </p><p>criminals". "Olban Valladares and Toribio Aguilera, Congressmen </p><p>representing the Innovation and Unity Party, declared that the </p><p>elimination of immunities will only benefit organized crime, </p><p>narco trafficking and a group of 12 untouchable entrepreneurs who </p><p>have become rich through illegal activities." </p><p> </p><p>"They insisted that the abolition of immunities will affect many </p><p>public officials, such as Congressmen, judicial agents, </p><p>prosecutors, judges, members of the Superior Court and other </p><p>officials of the Executive branch." </p><p> </p><p>"They believe it\'s essential to adjust the immunities law, to </p><p>protect the officials of the Judicial, Executive and Legislative </p><p>branch, and the Public Ministry during their duties as civil </p><p>servants." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
