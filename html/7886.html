END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>WFP\'S "ROLLING" EVOLUTION OF A TWINNING STRATEGY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) JOHN POWELL WALKED US MISSION STAFF THROUGH WFP\'S </p><p>EVOLVING TWINNING STRATEGY AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>A) DONORS TO THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) </p><p>PRESENTLY MAKE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE FORM OF FOOD </p><p>COMMODITIES, SERVICES (SUCH AS SHIPPING AND TRANSPORT) AND </p><p>CASH, ALL OF WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MOVE FOOD FROM A DONOR </p><p>TO SPECIFIC BENEFICIARIES. CASH IS THE MOST FLEXIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>DONORS OF COMMODITIES ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE THE CASH NEEDED </p><p>TO MEET THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR CONTRIBUTION. THESE </p><p>INVOLVE THE TRANSPORT, HANDLING AND STORAGE COSTS OF MOVING </p><p>THE FOOD FROM THE DONOR COUNTRY TO THE BENEFICIARIES, WHO </p><p>MAY BE LOCATED IN A LANDLOCKED COUNTRY IN ANOTHER CONTINENT. </p><p>DONORS ARE ALSO ASKED TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE OF THE OTHER </p><p>OPERATIONAL AND SUPPORT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SET UP AND </p><p>MANAGEMENT OF THE OPERATION SUCH AS MONITORING THE </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE FOOD TO MAKE SURE THAT IT ACTUALLY </p><p>REACHES THOSE FOR WHOM IT WAS INTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>B) MOST DONORS TO WFP ARE COUNTRIES; AND ALL MAJOR DONORS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01957  01 OF 02  071320Z </p><p>ARE MEMBERS OF THE OECD. SOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE </p><p>EMERGING AS DONORS. THESE EMERGING DONORS ARE WILLING TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE FOOD COMMODITIES BUT ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE </p><p>ASSOCIATED CASH. INDIA, FOR INSTANCE, DONATED ONE MILLION </p><p>TONS OF WHEAT TO AFGHANISTAN. BUT IT REQUIRES MORE THAN  USD </p><p>200 MILLION TO DELIVER THAT AMOUNT OF COMMODITIES TO </p><p>BENEFICIARIES IN AFGHANISTAN. AND INDIA SIMPLY DOES NOT HAVE </p><p>THE CASH. OTHER POTENTIAL DONORS INCLUDE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA, PAKISTAN, CHINA, THAILAND, VIET NAM, BRAZIL AND THE </p><p>UKRAINE, TO NAME A FEW. THERE ARE IMMENSE POSSIBILITIES - IF </p><p>A MECHANISM CAN BE FOUND TO ENABLE PROSPECTIVE DONORS TO </p><p>GIVE WHAT THEY HAVE, WHICH IS FOOD. </p><p> </p><p>C) THE CONCEPT OF TWINNING IS TO ESTABLISH A FINANCIAL </p><p>FACILITY THROUGH WHICH CASH COULD BE MATCHED WITH THE </p><p>COMMODITY CONTRIBUTIONS OF EMERGING DONORS THEREBY </p><p>LEVERAGING SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES OF FOOD. THE </p><p>LEVERAGE RATIO IS OFTEN HIGH. FOR EXAMPLE, A CASH DONATION </p><p>OF USD 2 MILLION WOULD LEVERAGE 20,000 TONS OF RICE FROM </p><p>INDIA TO SUPPORT VICTIMS OF THE CONFLICT IN SRI LANKA TO </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2919 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01957  02 OF 02  071321Z </p><p>ACTION SSO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   ANHR-00  EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00  TEDE-00 </p><p>      IO-00    NSCE-00  OIC-02   SS-00    TEST-00  PRM-00   SAS-00 </p><p>        /002W </p><p>                  ------------------611CA6  071321Z /38 </p><p>P 071321Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9708 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC PRIORITY 2662 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY KUWAIT </p><p>AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI </p><p>AMEMBASSY BANGKOK </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY COLOMBO </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3209 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001957 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01957  02 OF 02  071321Z </p><p>STATE FOR U/S LARSON, A/S PRM DEWEY, IO A/S HOLMES, EUR/WE, </p><p>IO/EDA SWINNICK, E FOR CPENCE </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS AND RTILSWORTH </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS AND JBRAUSE, AA/DCHA WINTER, </p><p>D/DCHA/OFDA BMCCONNELL, D/DCHA/FFP LANDIS </p><p>USUN FOR AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE AND MLUTZ </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USEU </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, AORC, WFP, UN, PREF, EAGR, EU </p><p>SUBJECT: "TWINNING" - WORLD FOOD PROGRAM UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>MAKE THE TRANSITION TO PEACE. THIS TRANSACTION WOULD </p><p>OTHERWISE COST AROUND USD 6 MILLION.  TWINNING IS THEREFORE </p><p>A MECHANISM THAT CAN BRING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES INTO THE </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY. TWINNING WOULD </p><p>ENABLE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO BECOME SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS IN THE FINANCING OF HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS </p><p>ACROSS THE WORLD, A BURDEN HITHERTO BORNE MAINLY BY OECD </p><p>COUNTRIES. FINALLY, THIS MECHANISM WOULD BE USED TO DIRECT </p><p>FOOD ASSISTANCE TO SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE, MAINLY </p><p>VICTIMS OF MAN-MADE OR NATURAL DISASTER. THESE ARE PEOPLE </p><p>WITHOUT THE MEANS TO HELP THEMSELVES. AS A CONSEQUENCE, </p><p>TRANSACTIONS OF THIS KIND WOULD NOT BE TRADE DISTORTING. </p><p> </p><p>D) THE PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH A SPECIAL FUND WITHIN WFP </p><p>NAMED "THE G-8 FUND FOR EMERGING DONORS". THE FUND WOULD BE </p><p>FINANCED BY G-8 MEMBERS BUT NON-G-8 MEMBERS WOULD BE INVITED </p><p>TO CONTRIBUTE. THE FUND COULD BE ESTABLISHED AT SAY, USD 500 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01957  02 OF 02  071321Z </p><p>MILLION, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF WFP\'S </p><p>EXPENDITURE IN 2002. (NOTE. IT WOULD ALSO BE POSSIBLE TO </p><p>CONSIDER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ENDOWMENT FUND. AN </p><p>ENDOWMENT WOULD INVOLVE MUCH LARGER INITIAL CONTRIBUTIONS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN THE CURRENT POOR INVESTMENT CLIMATE. IT WOULD, </p><p>HOWEVER, REDUCE THE NEED FOR REGULAR REPLENISHMENT. END </p><p>NOTE.) THE FUND WOULD BE SEPARATELY MANAGED AND ACCOUNTED </p><p>FOR BY WFP; AND IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AUDIT ACCORDING TO </p><p>WFP\'S FINANCIAL REGULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>E) THE PROPOSAL MAKES SOUND FINANCIAL SENSE; AND IT AVOIDS </p><p>SETTING UP COSTLY NEW ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES AND </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS. WFP\'S OVERHEAD COSTS ARE 7 PERCENT. MOST </p><p>IMPORTANTLY, IT WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DONORS BEARING </p><p>THE EXTRA-ORDINARY COSTS OF DEALING WITH THE EXPLOSION OF </p><p>HUMANITARIAN CRISES THAT NEED UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNTS OF FOOD </p><p>AID. AS THE UN\'S FOOD AID AGENCY, WFP IS ABLE TO ACHIEVE </p><p>ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN ITS OPERATIONS WORLD-WIDE, THEREBY </p><p>KEEPING COSTS LOW; AND IT HAS THE EXPERIENCE TO MANAGE </p><p>TWINNING ARRANGEMENTS WITH EMERGING DONORS. END OF JOHN </p><p>POWELL\'S PRESENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) WFP HAS SEEN ITS EMERGENCY PORTFOLIO (INCLUDING </p><p>IRAQ) FOR 2003 EXPAND FROM USD 2 BILLION (2002 LEVEL) TO USD </p><p>4 BILLION. AS A RULE, DONOR BUDGETS RARELY GROW </p><p>EXPONENTIALLY. INDIA (WHICH OFFERED ONE MILLION TONS OF </p><p>WHEAT FOR AFGHANISTAN IN OCTOBER 2001, HAS NOW OFFERED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01957  02 OF 02  071321Z </p><p>(APRIL) 50,000 MTS OF WHEAT FOR IRAQ, AND ANNOUNCED THAT IT </p><p>WOULD ARRANGE (PAY) ALL OCEAN SHIPPING CHARGES TO WFP </p><p>DESIGNATED PORTS IN THE REGION. BUT THE GOI CONCEDES THAT IT </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE THE ADDITIONAL CASH TO PAY IN-COUNTRY </p><p>TRANSPORT, SHIPPING AND HANDLING NOR WFP\'S SUPPORT COSTS. </p><p>JOHN POWELL IS HOPEFUL THAT A G8 ENDORSEMENT OF THE TWINNING </p><p>CONCEPT/STRATEGY AT THE EVIAN SUMMIT WILL MOVE THESE KINDS </p><p>OF OFFERS ALONG TO FRUITION.
