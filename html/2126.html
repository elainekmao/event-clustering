<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GABORONE 003514 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KHIV, EAID, SOCI, MASS, PHUM, BBG, BC </p><p>SUBJECT: A GRASS-ROOTS LOOK AT HIV/AIDS IN BOTSWANA </p><p> </p><p>REF: GABORONE 3255 </p><p> </p><p>INTRODUCTION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  DURING OUR RECENT TRAVELS UPCOUNTRY, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>AND EMBASSY STAFF LOOKED AT COMMUNITY-BASED ACTIVITIES IN </p><p>THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS AND INTERAGENCY USG SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THOSE EFFORTS.  IT WAS A SOBERING EXPERIENCE THAT </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE DEBILITATING SOCIAL EFFECTS OF THE </p><p>DISEASE. </p><p> </p><p>SELEBI-PHIKWE: "NUMBER ONE IN THE COUNTRY, NUMBER ONE IN </p><p>THE WORLD"; THE STIGMA OF HIV IS "GENOCIDE" </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON OCTOBER 19, WE ATTENDED THE OFFICIAL OPENING IN </p><p>SELEBI-PHIKWE OF ANOTHER TEBELOPELE VOLUNTARY COUNSELING </p><p>AND TESTING CENTER.  AS PART OF OUR INTERAGENCY EFFORT, </p><p>THE IBB/VOA STATION MANAGER INITIATED NEGOTIATIONS WITH </p><p>LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR THE PLOT OF LAND, THE OFFICE OF </p><p>DEFENSE COOPERATION BUILT THE STRUCTURE, AND THE CENTERS </p><p>FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION PROVIDED EQUIPMENT AND </p><p>STAFF.  THE OFFICIAL OPENING, WHICH ATTRACTED AROUND 200 </p><p>PEOPLE, WAS AN UPBEAT EVENT WITH A SERIOUS THEME.  IT </p><p>INCLUDED A TENT AND LARGE "KNOW YOUR STATUS" SIGNS TO </p><p>ATTRACT ATTENTION ON THE TOWN\'S MAIN STREET; A SKIT IN </p><p>SETSWANA ON HIV/AIDS; AND SPEECHES BY LOCAL OFFICIALS, </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR AND THE MINISTER OF HEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN AN IMPASSIONED SPEECH ALTERNATING BETWEEN ENGLISH </p><p>AND SETSWANA, MINISTER OF HEALTH JOY PHUMAPHI USED A </p><p>PHRASE WE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY HEARD FROM GOB LEADERS.  SHE </p><p>SAID THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH HIV/AIDS IS THE WORST </p><p>CRIME THAT BATSWANA HAVE EVER COMMITTED AGAINST </p><p>THEMSELVES AND SHE TERMED IT "GENOCIDE."  SHE ALSO </p><p>STRESSED THE POINT THAT A LEGAL DOCUMENT OF MARRIAGE DOES </p><p>NOT PROVIDE ANY PROTECTION AGAINST HIV AND URGED PEOPLE </p><p>TO BE TESTED PRIOR TO MARRIAGE.  (SHE HAS TOLD US IN THE </p><p>PAST THAT IN BOTSWANA, WHEN ONE PERSON IS INFECTED, THE </p><p>SPOUSE IS GENERALLY ALSO INFECTED.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN HIS CLOSING REMARKS, THE TOWN CLERK DERISIVELY </p><p>PROCLAIMED SELEBI-PHIKWE AS "NUMBER ONE IN THE COUNTRY, </p><p>NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD" IN HIV INFECTION.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>BOTSWANA LEADS THE WORLD IN HIV INFECTION RATES AND </p><p>WITHIN THE COUNTRY SELEBI-PHIKWE HAD TAKEN THE TOP SPOT </p><p>FROM FRANCISTOWN.  HE CITED THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES </p><p>FROM THE DECEMBER 2000 HIV SURVEY FOR BOTSWANA (FUNDED IN </p><p>PART BY CDC) ESTIMATING THAT 45.7 PERCENT OF ADULTS AGED </p><p>15-49 IN THE TOWN ARE HIV POSITIVE.  (SEE REFTEL FOR A </p><p>FULLER SUMMARY OF THAT SURVEY.)  THE CLERK ALSO DESCRIBED </p><p>THE HUMAN IMPACT OF THE TOLL: THE COUNCIL CARES FOR 445 </p><p>ORPHANED CHILDREN WHO ARE SCATTERED IN FOSTER HOMES </p><p>AROUND TOWN (POPULATION 50,000). </p><p> </p><p>FRANCISTOWN: HELPING CHILD-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS WHERE </p><p>PARENTS HAVE DIED OF AIDS; OTHER VULNERABLE CHILDREN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN FRANCISTOWN THAT EVENING, MINISTER PHUMAPHI (WHOSE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICT IS FRANCISTOWN EAST AND WHOSE </p><p>HUSBAND IS A PROMINENT ATTORNEY) HOSTED THE LAUNCHING OF </p><p>A TRUST AIMED AT ASSISTING (THROUGH PROVISION OF SHELTER, </p><p>TRAINING, ETC.) THE LIVES OF DISADVANTAGED MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>COMMUNITY (INCLUDING THE NEEDY, HOMELESS AND DESTITUTE </p><p>ORPHANS).  THE BASIC HOUSE TO BE PROVIDED TO THOSE IN </p><p>NEED WILL CONSIST OF ONE BEDROOM, ONE KITCHENETTE AND ONE </p><p>BATHROOM BUILT ON A SLAB FOR A TWO-ROOM HOUSE.  MANY OF </p><p>THE COMMUNITY LEADERS OF FRANCISTOWN (POPULATION 84,000) </p><p>WERE IN ATTENDANCE AND THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>GAVE THE KEYNOTE SPEECH. </p><p> </p><p>6.  PHUMAPHI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT MUCH OF THE WORK OF </p><p>THE TRUST WILL BE AIMED AT CHILD-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS, WHERE </p><p>CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 14 ARE CARING FOR THEIR YOUNGER </p><p>SIBLINGS AFTER THE DEATH OR INCAPACITATION OF THEIR </p><p>PARENTS DUE TO AIDS.  OTHER HOUSEHOLDS TO BE ASSISTED </p><p>INCLUDE THOSE IN WHICH BOTH PARENTS HAVE DIED AND THE </p><p>AGING GRANDPARENTS ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES COPING WITH </p><p>CHILD-CARING RESPONSIBILITIES.  ACCORDING TO PHUMAPHI, </p><p>THE PERFORMANCE OF CHILDREN AT SCHOOL TENDS TO DECLINE IN </p><p>THE LAST YEARS PRIOR TO THE DEATH OF A PARENT AS THE </p><p>CHILD SUFFERS FROM STRESS AND ADDITIONAL DUTIES AT HOME. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR HER EFFORTS AND </p><p>PROVIDED AN APPLICATION FORM FOR SELF-HELP PROGRAM </p><p>FUNDING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ON OCTOBER 20, THE SHINING STARS OF FRANCISTOWN\'S </p><p>MONARCH COMMUNITY OFFICIALLY OPENED THEIR NEW FACILITIES </p><p>PAID FOR BY ODC AND THE SELF-HELP PROGRAM.  MINISTER </p><p>PHUMAPHI AND THE AMBASSADOR WERE KEYNOTE SPEAKERS. </p><p>SHINING STARS IS A COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAM, ORGANIZED </p><p>UNDER TRUSTEESHIP OF THE TSHIRELETSO AIDS AWARENESS </p><p>GROUP, BENEFITING 275 VULNERABLE CHILDREN AGED 2 - 18. </p><p>THESE INCLUDE THOSE WHO ARE DESTITUTE, HAVE ILL PARENTS, </p><p>OR ARE ILL THEMSELVES.  THE ORGANIZATION DOES NOT LIMIT </p><p>ITSELF TO "AIDS ORPHANS," AS AIDS CARRIES A STIGMA THAT </p><p>IS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED FROM PARENT TO CHILD. </p><p>CHILDREN ENGAGE IN LIFE SKILLS, ACADEMIC AND SPORTS </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND ARE EDUCATED ABOUT HIV ("SO THEY CAN STAY </p><p>BEHIND WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE HAS GONE," ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>SHINING STARS DIRECTOR).  ALL WORK IS PERFORMED BY </p><p>VOLUNTEERS, AS THERE ARE NO PAID STAFF.  ONE OF THE TASKS </p><p>FOR ADULT SPONSORS IS TO CARE FOR PARENTS SICK WITH AIDS </p><p>SO THAT THEIR CHILDREN CAN ATTEND SCHOOL. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE ODC SUPPORT, PROVIDED THROUGH DOD\'S HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, INCLUDES TWO BUILDINGS, A </p><p>CLASSROOM/LIBRARY AND A KITCHEN/COMMON ROOM/REST ROOM </p><p>FACILITY.  THE AMBASSADOR\'S SELF-HELP FUND HAS PROVIDED </p><p>SHINING STARS WITH EDUCATIONAL EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE AND A </p><p>COMMERCIAL OVEN FOR PRODUCING BREAD FOR SALE TO THE </p><p>COMMUNITY.  PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF BREAD WILL BE USED </p><p>TO COVER ORPHAN-CARE OPERATING EXPENSES.  IT IS HOPED </p><p>THAT THIS WILL REDUCE SHINING STARS\' DEPENDENCE ON LOCAL </p><p>DONORS AS WELL AS GIVE ORPHAN BENEFICIARIES A SENSE OF </p><p>BEING ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE DIRECTOR HAS WORKED VERY HARD AND IS DOING A </p><p>COMMENDABLE JOB, BUT SHE STILL DOES NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH </p><p>COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR EVERYDAY EXPENSES: THE ELECTRIC </p><p>COMPANY HAD THREATENED TO CUT OFF POWER ON THE DAY </p><p>PRECEDING THE EVENT.  THIS IS THE SAME ORGANIZATION WHERE </p><p>THE CHILDREN, DURING OUR VISIT LAST YEAR, SERENADED US </p><p>WITH A SONG CARRYING THE HAUNTING REFRAIN, "MY MOTHER </p><p>DIED BEFORE I MET HER." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE TWO-DAY TRIP PROVIDED US WITH ANOTHER GLIMPSE AT </p><p>THE PERVASIVE IMPACT HIV/AIDS IS HAVING ON BOTSWANA.  NOT </p><p>ONLY ARE MANY ADULTS ALREADY INFECTED, INCLUDING NEARLY </p><p>ONE OUT OF TWO PEOPLE IN THEIR 20S, BUT LARGE NUMBERS OF </p><p>CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE BORN HIV </p><p>POSITIVE OR BECAUSE THEIR RELATIVES ARE DYING OF AIDS. </p><p>AMONG THE MANY USG PROGRAMS IN BOTSWANA RELATED TO </p><p>HIV/AIDS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS AIMED AT </p><p>ASSISTING SUCH NEEDY CASES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LANGE </p><p></p></div>
