<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 08 KUWAIT 05979 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p>USIA FOR NEA, R/NA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  OPRC, KPRP, KU </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE PRESS LORDS OF KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A. 83 KUWAIT A-7 (NOTAL) </p><p>-      B. KUWAIT 3922 (NOTAL) </p><p>-      C. KUWAIT 0670 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  IN LESS THAN 30 YEARS, KUWAIT HAS </p><p>DEVELOPED A POWERFUL CLASS OF NEWSPAPER MAGNATES WHICH, </p><p>NOT SURPRISINGLY REFLECTS THE POLITICAL-ECONOMIC </p><p>GROUPINGS IN MODERN KUWAITI SOCIETY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  REFTELS WELL POINT OUT THE ROUGH DIVISION OF THE </p><p>KUWAITI POWER STRUCTURE INTO A SUNNI MERCHANT </p><p>ARISTOCRACY, THE RULING AL-SABAH FAMILY, THE JENAAT </p><p>CLAN, AND THE SHIA MERCHANT ARISTOCRACY, CLOSELY ALLIED </p><p>WITH THE AL-SABAHS.  OTHER INFORMAL POWER CENTERS </p><p>INCLUDE VARIOUS SUNNI AND SHIA CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS </p><p>FACTIONS AND AN INCHOATE LEFTIST GROUPING.  LOOKING AT </p><p>THE FULL RANGE OF KUWAITI MEDIA, A GENERAL DIVISION MAY </p><p>ALSO BE DISCERNED. </p><p> </p><p>A.  GOVERNMENT- (I.E. AL-SABAH) CONTROLLED:  KUNA </p><p>(KUWAIT NEWS AGENCY), KUWAIT TELEVISION (2 CHANNELS), </p><p>KUWAIT RADIO (BROADCASTING IN ARABIC, FARSI, ENGLISH </p><p>AND URDU), AND THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES\' PUBLICATIONS </p><p>INCLUDING "AL-ARABI" (CIRCULATION:  300,000), THE </p><p>LARGEST CIRCULATION MAGAZINE IN THE ARAB WORLD </p><p>(PUBLISHED MONTHLY BY THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION). </p><p> </p><p>B.  SUNNI MERCHANT ARISTOCRACY:  "AL QABAS" (DAILY; </p><p>AL-SAQER, AL-NISIF, AL-KHURAFI, AL-BAHAR AND AL-SHAYA </p><p>FAMILY), "AL-ANBA" (DAILY; MARZOUK FAMILY), "OSRATI" </p><p>(MONTHLY; A DIFFERENT BRANCH OF THE MARZOUKS). </p><p> </p><p>C.  JENAAT CLAN: "AL-WATAN" (DAILY; LARGELY BY MUSAED </p><p>AL-SALEH FAMILY). </p><p> </p><p>D.  NON-MERCHANT ARISTOCRACY SUNNI: "AL-SIYASSAH" </p><p>(DAILY; JARALLAH FAMILY), "ARAB TIMES" (ENGLISH </p><p>LANGUAGE DAILY; ALSO JARALLAH FAMILY), "AL-RAI AL-AAM" </p><p>(DAILY; MASAEED FAMILY), "AL-NAHDA" (MONTHLY; ALSO </p><p>MASAEED FAMILY), "KUWAIT TIMES" (ENGLISH-LANGUAGE </p><p>DAILY; "ALTICO" FROZEN FOOD IMPORTER YUSUF S. ALYAN). </p><p> </p><p>E.  SHIA MERCHANT ARISTOCRACY: "AL-YAQZA" (MONTHLY; </p><p>BEHBEHANI FAMILY). </p><p> </p><p>F.  SUNNI FUNDAMENTALISTS: "AL-MUJTAMA" (WEEKLY; THE </p><p>SOCIAL REFORM SOCIETY, IDENTIFIED WITH THE MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD). </p><p> </p><p>G.  LEFTISTS: "AL-TALIAT" (BI-WEEKLY, ACTUALLY </p><p>APPEARING IRREGULARLY; FORMER NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTY </p><p>SAMI AL-MUNAYYES). </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE PUBLICATIONS OWNED BY THE SHIA, THE SUNNI </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS, LEFTIST "AL-TALIAT", AS WELL AS THE </p><p>ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PRESS AND OTHER WEEKLIES AND DAILIES, </p><p>HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE ON THE LARGER KUWAITI SOCIETY </p><p>(THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILIES ARE PROFITABLE CASH COWS </p><p>FOR THEIR OWNERS WHO ALSO RECEIVE ALMOST DOLLARS </p><p>100,000 (KD 28,000) A YEAR FROM THE GOK AS A SUBSIDY). </p><p>WHILE "AL-TALIAT" AND "AL-MUJTAMA" HAVE A CERTAIN </p><p>NUISANCE VALUE TO THE KUWAITI POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>ELITE, THEY ARE COMPARATIVELY LIMITED IN TERMS OF </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INFLUENCE.  IT IS THE </p><p>GOK-CONTROLLED ELECTRONIC MEDIA AND THE FIVE ARABIC </p><p>DAILIES (UNDER THE MODERATING HAND OF GOK CENSORSHIP) </p><p>THAT HAVE A POWERFUL, DAILY IMPACT ON THE WAY KUWAITIS </p><p>VIEW THEMSELVES, THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD. </p><p>REFTEL C FOCUSED ON THE DECISION-MAKING STRUCTURE IN </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION WHICH RUNS RADIO AND </p><p>TELEVISION IN KUWAIT, THIS CABLE FOCUSES ON THE </p><p>OWNERSHIP AND DIRECTION OF THE FIVE ARABIC DAILIES. </p><p> </p><p>5. AL-RAI AL-AAM </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>FOUNDED ON APRIL 16, 1961, "AL-RAI AL-AAM" IS THE </p><p>OLDEST BUT LOWEST CIRCULATING OF THE FIVE </p><p>ARABIC-LANGUAGE DAILIES AND IS WHOLLY OWNED BY FOUNDER </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        KUWAIT  05979  02 OF 08  021158Z </p><p> </p><p>ABDULAZIZ F. AL-MASAEED.  AL-MASAEED, IN HIS SEVENTIES, </p><p>ALSO PUBLISHES THE WEEKLY "AL-NAHDA" (PUBLISHER\'S </p><p>ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: 110,000, OF WHICH ALMOST HALF IS </p><p>SUPPOSED TO BE IN SAUDI ARABIA).  HE REPORTEDLY ALSO IS </p><p>A PARTNER IN SEVERAL HOTEL VENTURES IN THE UNITED ARAB </p><p>EMIRATES AND OWNS THE CARLTON HOTEL IN KUWAIT. </p><p> </p><p>AL-MASAEED WAS A DEPUTY IN KUWAIT\'S NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>FROM 1967 TO 1971.  IN THE HEADY ATMOSPHERE OF THE </p><p>1961-1976 PERIOD, WITH FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND A </p><p>FUNCTIONING PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, AL-MASAEED AND </p><p>"AL-RAI AL-AAM" WERE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH.  THE </p><p>PAPER WAS VERY MUCH IN THE IMAGE OF THIS PROUD, </p><p>SOMETIMES VINDICTIVE MAN OF LITTLE FORMAL EDUCATION. </p><p>AL-MASAEED IS FAMOUS IN KUWAIT FOR BEING A LITTLE ODD, </p><p>SOMETIMES SENSATIONALIST, AND LATELY ALSO MORE WILLING </p><p>TO OPENLY CALL FOR THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PRACTICES SUSPENDED BY THE AMIR THAN OTHER DAILIES (HIS </p><p>RIVALS ATTRIBUTE THIS TO THE FACT THAT "SINCE NO ONE </p><p>READS THE PAPER ANYWAY, THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO GET </p><p>ATTENTION"). </p><p> </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE PAPER WAS TRADITIONALLY ANTI-LEFTIST </p><p>(AL-MASAEED WAS VIRULENT IN HIS ATTACKS ON LEFTIST </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY LEADER AHMED AL-KHATIB DURING HIS TERM IN </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY) AND STRONGLY PRO-SABAH </p><p>(AL-MASAEED HAS CURRENTLY CONTRACTED KUWAITI SCULPTOR </p><p>SAMI MUHAMMAD TO CREATE A LARGER THAN LIFE STATUE OF </p><p>THE LATE AMIR ABDULLAH AL-SALEM, THE FATHER OF "KUWAITI </p><p>DEMOCRACY" FOR THE NEWSPAPER\'S LOBBY), AL-MASAEED HAS </p><p>BECOME INCREASINGLY BITTER AT HIS PAPER\'S DECLINE AND </p><p>AT THE CURRENT AMIR\'S FAILURE TO RESTORE PARLIAMENT AND </p><p>FREEDOM OF THE PRESS SINCE 1986.  WHEN AN EDITORIAL OF </p><p>HIS CALLING FOR DEMOCRACY WAS CENSORED IN EARLY 1989, </p><p>HE RESPONDED BY PUBLISHING WITH A BLANK EDITORIAL </p><p>SECTION ON THE FRONT PAGE, FOLLOWING THIS UP BY PUTTING </p><p>HIS OWN PICTURE IN THE SPACE THE DAY AFTER THAT. </p><p> </p><p>DURING THE SALAD YEARS OF THE PAPER, HE DESCRIBED </p><p>HIMSELF AS A "SACK OF COAL TO MY ENEMIES", MEANING THAT </p><p>HE HAD THE POWER OF GETTING OTHERS DIRTY WITHOUT </p><p>GETTING HIMSELF SOILED.  WITH INCREASED COMPETITION BY </p><p>BETTER-FUNDED AND MORE AGGRESSIVE RIVALS IN THE EARLY </p><p>1970S, "AL-RAI AL-AAM" HAS BEEN ON A 15-YEAR </p><p>CIRCULATION SLIDE.  THE PAPER WEATHERED A FINANCIAL </p><p>CRISIS FROM 1982-1986 WHEN ADVERTISING REVENUE DRIED UP </p><p>IN THE WAKE OF THE SUQ AL-MANAKH CRISIS, AND IS NOW IN </p><p>DECENT, BUT GUARDED, FINANCIAL HEALTH, ALTHOUGH IT </p><p>REMAINS THE LEAST FINANCIALLY STABLE OF THE FIVE PAPERS. </p><p> </p><p>ITS STANCE AS THE ONLY PRO-SYRIAN VS PRO-IRAQI OF THE </p><p>KUWAITI ARABIC DAILIES, IS DUE LESS TO ANY POSSIBLE </p><p>SYRIAN PAYOFFS THAN TO THE FACT THAT THE MANAGING </p><p>EDITOR IS A SYRIAN, GHASSAN SAMMAN, WHO OVERSEES MUCH </p><p>OF THE PAPER\'S COMPOSITION.  FAHED ABDULAZIZ </p><p>AL-MASAEED, THE OWNER\'S SECOND SON, IS TECHNICALLY THE </p><p>EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, BUT HAS A SERIOUS DRINKING PROBLEM </p><p>(WHICH PLAYED A ROLE IN THE DEATH OF ABDULAZIZ </p><p>AL-MASAEED\'S ELDEST, AMERICAN-EDUCATED SON). </p><p> </p><p>6.  AL-SIYASSAH </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>"AL-SIYASSAH" WAS STARTD IN 1965 AS A WEEKLY BY AHMED </p><p>ABDUL-AZIZ AL-JARALLAH, A KUWAITI OF RELATIVELY RECENT </p><p>SADI ORIGIN, AND BECAME A DAILY IN APRIL 1968. </p><p>SENIOR USIS FSN RECALLS THAT WHEN PAOS WOULD G IN THE </p><p>EARLY 1960S TO SEE THE THEN-POWERFU AL-MASAEED, CUB </p><p>REPORTER JARALLAH WOULD BE SENT OUT "TO BRING SOME </p><p>PEPSIS, AND CLOSE TH DOOR AFTER YOU." </p><p> </p><p>A MAN OF RELATIVELY HUMBLE BACKGROUND, JARALLAH (NOW IN </p><p>HIS FIFTIES) WAS ABLE TO PARLAY A WINNING PERSONALITY </p><p>AND A FRIENDSHIP WITH THE THEN-MINISTER OF INFORMATION </p><p>INTO A PUBLISHING EMPIRE.  AL-JARALLAH BOUGHT </p><p>"AL-SIYASSAH" FROM AL-MASAEED WITH A BANK LOAN AND THEN </p><p>SECURED THE LICENSE TO TURN "AL-SIYASSAH" INTO A DAILY </p><p>FROM HIS FRIEND THE MINISTER.  IN 1976, AL-JARALLAH </p><p>BOUGHT THE LICENSE FORU,2T9YQ, FOR MORE </p><p>THAN KD 160,000.  AL-JARALLAH\'S SEPARATION FROM </p><p>AL-MASAEED WAS AMICABLE AND HE STILL CARRIES THE </p><p>DISTINCTION OF BEING THE ONLY ONE OF THE FIVE NEWSPAPER </p><p>OWNERS USUALLY ON GOOD TERMS WITH ALL THE OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>"AL-SIYASSAH" AND "ARAB TIMES" ARE OWNED FORMALLY BY </p><p>DAR AL-SIYASSAH FOR PRINTING, PUBLISHING AND </p><p>DISTRIBUTION WHICH IN TURN IS OWNED BY ITS </p><p>STOCKHOLDERS: AHMED AL-JARALLAH, SULAIMAN ABDUL-AZIZ </p><p>AL-JARALLAH (AHMED\'S BROTHER AND AL-SIYASSAH BUSINESS </p><p>MANAGER), MESHA\'AL AHMED AL-JARALLAH (AHMED\'S ELDEST </p><p>SON, EDITOR OF THE "ARAB TIMES", SPEEDBOAT AND RACE CAR </p><p>ENTHUSIAST), AND SATTAM AHMED AL-JARALLAH (AHMED\'S </p><p>3-YEAR OLD SON).  THE COMPANY\'S SHARES HAVE BEEN DULY </p><p>REGISTERED BUT, UNLIKE "AL-QABAS", HAVE NOT BEEN </p><p>PUBLISHED ANYWHERE.  THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS A WEEKLY </p><p>NEWSPAPER "AL-HADAF" PUBLISHED ON FRIDAYS IN PLACE OF </p><p>"AL-SIYASSAH" TO ALLOW AL-JARALLAH TO HOLD ON TO ITS </p><p>PUBLISHING LICENSE, WHICH SOMEDAY MAY BECOME USEFUL. </p><p>"AL-HADAF" IS ALMOST ENTIRELY MADE UP OF FILLER </p><p>MATERIAL, "SOCIETY PAGES" AND HOLLYWOOD GOSSIP. </p><p> </p><p>AL-JARALLAH STRIKES MANY AS SOMETHING OF A </p><p>NOUVEAU-RICHE SOCIAL CLIMBER WHO LOVES TO PRINT HIS </p><p>PICTURE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF HIS PAPERS INTERVIEWING </p><p>REGIONAL AND WORLD LEADERS, INCLUDING A LENGTHY </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH ADNAN KHASHOGGI IN THE "ARAB TIMES"). </p><p>HE WAS A MAJOR PROMOTER OF, AND HEAVY PARTICIPANT IN, </p><p>THE OVERHEATED KUWAITI STOCK MARKET THAT COLLAPSED IN </p><p>1982, AND HAS BEEN PRIVATELY TAKEN TO TASK BY THE </p><p>MARZOUKS, AS WELL AS BY A LOT OF LESSER INVESTORS WHO </p><p>LOST THEIR SHIRTS IN THE COLLAPSE, FOR CONTRIBUTING TO </p><p>THE FINAL DEBACLE. </p><p> </p><p>BUT AL-JARALLAH HAS ALSO SHOWN SOME POLITICAL COURAGE. </p><p>"AL-SIYASSAH" WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE KUWAITI PAPERS TO </p><p>SUPPORT EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT SADAT\'S PEACE OVERTURES TO </p><p>ISRAEL AND CALLED ON THE PLO TO MODERATE ITS POLICIES </p><p>YEARS AGO.  THESE STANDS, PLUS A HARD-LINE ANTI-SYIAN </p><p>EDITORIAL POLICY, ARE USUALLY CONNECTED B OBSERVERS </p><p>HERE WITH AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT I APRIL 1985, </p><p>POSSIBLY CARRIED OUT BY RADICAL PLESTINIAN ELEMENTS </p><p>ALLIED WITH SYRIA.  SINCE TEN, AL-JARALLAH HAS NOT </p><p>MELLOWED; HE HAS EEN A VOCIFEROUS SUPPORTER OF </p><p>LEBANESE GENERAL ICHEL AOUN (UNDER CENSORSHIP, THIS IS </p><p>THE BST WAY TO ATTACK THE SYRIANS) AND OF IRAQ (SO </p><p>PRO-IRAQI THAT HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING ON HE </p><p>IRAQI PAYROLL, AS HE WAS ACCUSED OF WORKIN FOR THE </p><p>SAUDIS SOME YEARS AGO). </p><p> </p><p>WHEN THE SS LA SALLE, FLAGSHIP OF THE US NAVAL FORCES </p><p>N THE GULF, CAME TO KUWAIT IN ERL 1989, AL-JARALLAH </p><p>WAS THE ONLY ONE OF FOUR EDITORS-IN-CHIEF CONTACTED BY </p><p>THE PAO WHO AGREED IMMEDIATELY TO DO A STORY ON THE </p><p>SHIP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AL-WATAN </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>FOUNDED ON JANUARY 17, 1974, "AL-WATAN" IS KUWAIT\'S </p><p>MOST CONSISTENTLY LEFT-WING ARABIC DAILY.  IT COVERS </p><p>EVENTS AFFECTING THE PLO AND THE PALESTINIANS WITH </p><p>ALMOST AS MUCH CARE AS KUWAITI LOCAL NEWS.  IT </p><p>GENERALLY REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF THE POWERFUL </p><p>10,000-MEMBER JENAAT CLAN WHICH ORIGINATED IN SOUTHERN </p><p>IRAQ AND CAME TO KUWAIT IN THE 19TH CENTURY.  AS ONE </p><p>REPORTER PUT IT, "THE GULF BANK IS THE JENAAT BANK AND </p><p>"AL-WATAN" IS THE JENAAT MOUTHPIECE". </p><p> </p><p>IN THE YEARS SINCE ITS FOUNDING, "AL-WATAN" HAS HAD </p><p>MANY CLASHES WITH THE GOK AND THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>INFORMATION\'S CENSOR AS IT HAS BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER </p><p>OF LEFT-WING POLITICAL ELEMENTS IN THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY, ESPECIALLY AHMED AL-KHATIB.  IT PROVIDES THE </p><p>MOST EXTENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE KUWAIT LABOR MOVEMENT </p><p>AND FREQUENTLY FEATURES INTERVIEWS ON, OR GROUP </p><p>DISCUSSIONS OF, TOPICAL ISSUES WITH LESSER- OR UNKNOWN </p><p>KUWAITIS. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE MAINTAINING A LEFT-OF-CENTER EDITORIAL LINE, THE </p><p>PAPER DOES NOT LET POLITICS GET IN THE WAY OF GOOD </p><p>BUSINESS.  WHEN IN EARLY 1989 FUAD AL-HASHEM, ONE OF </p><p>THE PAPER\'S MORE STRIDENT COLUMNISTS, GOT "AL-WATAN" </p><p>BANNED IN THE LUCRATIVE SAUDI MARKET FOR AN INTEMPERATE </p><p>ATTACK ON A FORMER SAUDI KING, HE WAS IMMEDIATELY </p><p>FIRED.  EDITOR-IN-CHIEF JASSEM AL-MUTAWAA QUIPPED THAT </p><p>"HE EMBARRASSED US ONCE TOO OFTEN, HE\'S BAD FOR </p><p>BUSINESS."  THE "AL-WATAN" PRINTING SUBSIDIARY HAS ALSO </p><p>CONSISTENTLY UNDERBID THE OTHER KUWAITI PAPERS IN </p><p>MEETING USIS KUWAIT\'S PRINTING NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>THE STRONGMAN OF "AL-WATAN" IS ITS CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>BOARD, CAIRO-EDUCATED MUHAMMAD MUSAED AL-SALEH, IN HIS </p><p>SIXTIES AND IN POOR HEALTH.  A LAWYER WITH A VERY </p><p>SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE (AL-SALEH, GRAHAM AND JAMES), HE IS </p><p>A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AN ADMIRER OF </p><p>AMERICAN DEMOCRACY (ADDING THAT "THE PROBLEM IS THE WAY </p><p>THE US BEHAVES OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS"), AND A PARTISAN OF </p><p>A MODERATE FORM OF ISLAM THAT HIS FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>CRITICS HAVE TERMED AS "ATHEISM IN MULLAH\'S CLOTHING". </p><p> </p><p>THE PAPER IS OWNED BY DAR AL-WATAN FOR PRINTING, PRESS, </p><p>AND PUBLISHING, WHICH IS IN TURN CONTROLLED (51 </p><p>PERCENT) BY THE AL-MASALEH COMPANY WHICH BELONGS TO </p><p>MUHAMMED MUSAED AL-SALEH AND HIS CLOSE RELATIVES. </p><p>AL-MASALEH COMPANY\'S DIRECTOR IS NAJIB MUSAED AL-SALEH, </p><p>MUHAMMAD\'S NEPHEW.  TWELVE PERCENT OF DAR AL-WATAN IS </p><p>OWNED BY VERY WEALTHY FINANCIER YUSSUF ABDULAZIZ </p><p>AL-MUZAINI AND 15 PERCENT BELONGS TO SHAIKH FAHED </p><p>AL-AHMED AL-SABAH (THE ONLY AL-SABAH TO OPENLY OWN ANY </p><p>KUWAITI NEWSPAPER), WHO IS HEAD OF THE KUWAITI OLYMPIC </p><p>COMMITTEE.  SHAIKH FAHED IS SOMETHING OF A "BLACK </p><p>SHEEP" IN THE AL-SABAH FAMILY HAVING BEEN INTIMATELY </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE "FATEH" MOVEMENT.  THIS GIVES </p><p>"AL-WATAN" THE DUBIOUS DISTINCTION OF HAVING </p><p>CONNECTIONS WITH TWO FORMER KUWAITI GUERRILLAS:  SHAIKH </p><p>FAHED, AND HARVARD-EDUCATED COLUMNIST AHMED AL-RIBI WHO </p><p>FOUGHT AGAINST THE SULTAN OF OMAN\'S FORCES IN DHOFAR. </p><p>THE REMAINING 22 PERCENT OF DAR AL-WATAN IS HELD </p><p>PERSONALLY BY MUHAMMAD MUSAED AL-SALEH AND ABOUT HALF A </p><p>DOZEN SMALLER INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS. </p><p> </p><p>THE PAPER\'S EDITOR-IN-CHIEF JASSEM AL-MUTAWAA (ALSO A </p><p>JENAAT), IN HIS FORTIES, IS THE BROTHER-IN-LAW OF </p><p>MUHAMMAD MUSAED AL-SALEH. </p><p> </p><p>8.  AL-QABAS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>WHILE "AL-WATAN" SEEMS TO HAVE A SOLID LOCK ON THIRD </p><p>PLACE IN CIRCULATION, THE TWO REMAINING KUWAITI PAPERS, </p><p>"AL-QABAS" AND "AL-ANBA" BOTH CLAIM THE DISTINCTION OF </p><p>BEING THE TOP-SELLING PAPER IN THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>"AL-QABAS", FOUNDED IN 1972, IS A SOLID ENTERPRISE </p><p>OWNED BY SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST MEMBERS OF KUWAIT\'S </p><p>SUNNI MERCHANT ARISTOCRACY.  ACCORDING TO THE FOUNDING </p><p>CONTRACT OF DAR AL-QABAS FOR PRESS, PRINTING AND </p><p>PUBLISHING AS PRINTED IN THE OFFICIAL GAZETTE "KUWAIT </p><p>AL-YAWM", THE COMPANY\'S SHARES ARE EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO </p><p>FIVE PORTIONS OF 400 EACH BELONGING TO: </p><p> </p><p>A.  YUSUF AL-NISIF, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, WHOSE FATHER, </p><p>ORIGINAL SHAREHOLDER MUHAMMAD YUSUF AL-NISIF, DIED IN </p><p>1982. </p><p> </p><p>B.  BILLIONAIRE MUHAMMAD ABDEL-MUHSEN AL-KHURAFI, </p><p>DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, MEMBER OF </p><p>THE BOARD OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF KUWAIT, AND FATHER OF </p><p>THE CURRENT FINANCE MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>C.  MUHAMMAD ABDULRAHMAN AL-BAHAR, ALSO A DIRECTOR OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL BANK OF KUWAIT, AND AGENT FOR GENERAL </p><p>ELECTRIC, VOLVO, AND MANY OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>D.  ABDULAZIZ AL-SHAYA, CHAIRMAN, (WHOSE FAMILY </p><p>ORIGINALLY CAME TO KUWAIT FROM THE SAME NEJDI VILLAGE </p><p>AS THE AL-KHURAFIS).  THE SHAYAS OWN THE KUWAIT </p><p>SHERATON AND A HOST OF OTHER BUSINESSES. </p><p> </p><p>E.  MUHAMMAD JASSEM AL-SAQER, CURRENT EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, </p><p>WHO REPLACED HIS FATHER, ORIGINAL SHAREHOLDER JASSEM </p><p>HAMAD AL-SAQER, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF </p><p>KUWAIT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEE OF THE DEFUNCT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND BROTHER </p><p>OF ABDUL AZIZ AL-SAQER, THE POWERFUL CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>KUWAIT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY. </p><p>THE CONTRACT ESTABLISHED THE COMPANY\'S INITIAL CAPITAL </p><p>AT 15,000 KUWAITI DINARS WHICH MEANS THAT EACH ORIGINAL </p><p>SHAREHOLDER PAID KD 3,000 FOR THEIR 400 SHARES.  NOT A </p><p>LARGE INVESTMENT FOR AN ENTERPRISE NOW WORTH IN THE </p><p>TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  (THE BUSINESS MANAGER OF </p><p>"AL-WATAN" ESTIMATED THAT THE VALUE OF THE PHYSICAL </p><p>ASSETS OF THE PAPERS IS ABOUT 25 MILLION DOLLARS EACH.) </p><p> </p><p>WHILE "AL-QABAS\'" OWNERSHIP IS EQUALLY DIVIDED, THE </p><p>PAPER\'S HEART IS MUHAMMAD JASSEM AL-SAQER, A WHITTIER </p><p>GRADUATE IN HIS EARLY 40S WHO HAS BEEN ITS DYNAMIC </p><p>EDITOR-IN-CHIEF SINCE 1982.  THE AL-SAQERS ARE </p><p>ORIGINALLY MEMBERS OF THE ONAIZA TRIBE, AS ARE THE </p><p>AL-SABAH, AND WERE PIONEERS IN THE KUWAITI SEA TRADE TO </p><p>INDIA AND AFRICA UNTIL THE MID-19TH CENTURY WHEN THE </p><p>FAMILY FORTUNE AND FAMILY PATRIARCH WENT DOWN WITH ALL </p><p>HANDS IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.  BY THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY, </p><p>THE FAMILY HAD STARTED A SECOND FORTUNE AND MUHAMMAD\'S </p><p>GRANDFATHER HAMAD ABDULLAH AL-SAQER WAS A STRONG </p><p>OPPONENT OF AL-SABAH FAMILY RULE.  IN THE 1938 MERCHANT </p><p>FAMILY REVOLT AIMED AT LIMITING AL-SABAH POWER, </p><p>MUHAMMAD\'S TWO UNCLES, ABDULLAH (DIED 1974) AND </p><p>ABDULAZIZ (THE FIRST NON-AL-SABAH TO BE NAMED A </p><p>GOVERNMENT MINISTER), PLAYED PROMINENT ROLES. </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING IN THE FAMILY TRADITION, MUHAMMAD JASSEM </p><p>AL-SAQER IS A STRONG, OFTEN WITTY, CRITIC OF AL-SABAH </p><p>AUTOCRACY, WHOSE CHALLENGES ALSO EXTEND INTO THE REALM </p><p>OF SPORT CLUB RIVALRIES.  ALTHOUGH "AL-QABAS" IS MORE </p><p>CENTRIST THAN "AL-WATAN", IN MANY WAYS HIS WORLD VIEW </p><p>IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF MUHAMMAD MUSAED AL-SALEH:  BOTH </p><p>PROFESS TO ADMIRE THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SYSTEM AND WAY </p><p>OF LIFE, BUT BOTH INTENSELY DISLIKE U.S. FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>IN GENERAL, AND IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN PARTICULAR </p><p>(ALTHOUGH MOHAMMED JASSEM IS A FERVENT SUPPORTER OF THE </p><p>US NAVAL PROTECTION REGIME AND PRESENCE IN THE GULF). </p><p>AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF THE ARAB COMPANY FOR </p><p>TRADING SECURITIES, MUHAMMAD PARTICIPATED IN THE 1980 </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WHICH LED TO THE COMPANY PURCHASING 19 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE NEW YORK INVESTMENT FIRM OF SMITH, </p><p>BARNEY.  THE KUWAITI-SAUDI NEGOTIATING TEAM ALSO </p><p>INCLUDED MUHAMMAD\'S BROTHER, WAEL, A PROMINENT </p><p>FINANCIER AND UC-BERKELY GRADUATE. </p><p> </p><p>WITH EXPERIENCE IN INTERNATIONAL FINANCE, AL-SAQER HAS </p><p>SET UP AN INTERNATIONAL EDITION OF "AL-QABAS" CURRENTLY </p><p>PUBLISHED IN PARIS, LONDON AND MARSEILLES (FOR THE </p><p>NORTH AFRICAN MARKET), A VENTURE THAT HAS LOST MONEY </p><p>SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1985 (AL-SAQER ADDS THAT "THE </p><p>LOSSES ARE EXPECTED AND MEASURED").  HE HAS AMBITIOUS </p><p>PLANS TO PRINT THE INTERNATIONAL EDITION IN BUDAPEST </p><p>AND IN THE UNITED STATES WITHIN A YEAR.  "AL-QABAS" </p><p>MAINTAINS THE MOST EXTENSIVE FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT </p><p>STAFF OF ANY KUWAITI NEWSPAPER WITH LARGE BUREAUS IN </p><p>WASHINGTON, LONDON, BEIRUT, CAIRO, AND EVEN A </p><p>CORRESPONDENT IN MOSCOW.  THE LOCAL EDITION OF </p><p>"AL-QABAS" CIRCULATES EXTENSIVELY IN THE GULF, WITH </p><p>AL-SAQER MAKING THE CLAIM THAT THE PAPER IS THE </p><p>FOURTH-LARGEST CIRCULATING PAPER IN SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>(27,000 COPIES A DAY, AFTER THREE SAUDI PAPERS) AND A </p><p>GROWING MARKET IN IRAQ (ABOUT 9,000 COPIES).  IN </p><p>KUWAIT, HE HAS BEEN THE NEWSPAPER TECHNOLOGY LEADER - </p><p>"AL-QABAS" WAS THE FIRST PAPER TO USE COLOR, AN </p><p>INNOVATION THAT THE OTHER FOUR WERE FORCED TO FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>A CANDID MAN IN PRIVATE, WHO IS A USEFUL EMBASSY </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR, AL-SAQER ADMITS THAT THE PAPER\'S KUWAIT </p><p>CIRCULATION IS ABOUT 70,000 INSTEAD OF THE 98,000 THAT </p><p>THE PAPER PUBLICLY CLAIMS.  THE RIVALRY BETWEEN </p><p>"AL-QABAS" AND "AL-ANBA" SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN LARGELY </p><p>PERSONALIZED BY AL-SAQER AND FAISAL AL-MARZOUK, WHO </p><p>MAINTAIN ICILY CORRECT RELATIONS, BUT AT TIMES HAVE </p><p>TAKEN TO CUTTING EACH OTHER OUT OF GROUP PICTURES WITH </p><p>THE AMIR. </p><p> </p><p>9.  AL-ANBA </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>FOUNDED IN FEBRUARY, 1976 "AL-ANBA" CLAIMS A </p><p>CIRCULATION OF 102,000 WHICH ITS RIVALS REJECT AS AN </p><p>EXAGGERATION BY ABOUT 30 PERCENT.  ITS MAJORITY OWNERS </p><p>ARE THE EXTREMELY WEALTHY AL-MARZOUK FAMILY.  THE </p><p>MARZOUK\'S PAST IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF OTHER SUNNI </p><p>MERCHANT ARISTOCRATS:  MIGRATION FROM ARABIA IN THE </p><p>1700S AS PART OF THE SUBAY TRIBE, SEA TRADE FROM IRAQ </p><p>TO INDIA AND AFRICA, AND GOLD SMUGGLING.  THE </p><p>AL-MARZOUKS ALSO PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN THE 1938 </p><p>MERCHANT FAMILY REVOLT AGAINST AL-SABAH ABSOLUTISM (THE </p><p>SHORT-LIVED 14-MAN PEOPLE\'S LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL SET UP </p><p>THEN INCLUDED TWO AL-MARZOUKS AND ONE AL-SAQER). </p><p> </p><p>THE KUWAIT PRESS HOUSE COMPANY WHICH OWNS "AL-ANBA" IS </p><p>OWNED LARGELY (84 PERCENT) BY THE THREE AL-MARZOUK </p><p>BROTHERS AND ONE NEPHEW: </p><p> </p><p>A.  KHALED YUSUF AL-MARZOUK:  THE FAMILY EMPIRE BUILDER </p><p>LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MOVING THE AL-MARZOUKS FROM THE </p><p>RANKS OF THE KUWAITI RICH TO THE SUPER-RICH BY </p><p>EMPHASIZING INTERNATIONAL FINANCE AND REAL ESTATE </p><p>INSTEAD OF TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>B.  FAISAL YUSUF AL-MARZOUK: HARTFORD UNIVERSITY </p><p>EDUCATED EDITOR-IN-CHIEF; DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL BANK OF KUWAIT; BOARD MEMBER OF PETRA BANK </p><p>(JORDAN) AND OF SEVERAL BAHRAINI BANKS; FORMER CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF KUWAIT SHIPBUILDING CORPORATION;  AND HEAVILY </p><p>INVOLVED IN REAL ESTATE IN CALIFORNIA. </p><p> </p><p>C.  JASSEM YUSUF AL-MARZOUK:  KUWAIT\'S FIRST JET PILOT </p><p>AND FORMER DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF KUWAIT AIRWAYS. </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        KUWAIT  05979  07 OF 08  021204Z </p><p> </p><p>D.  WALEED KHALED AL-MARZOUK, KHALED YUSUF\'S SON. </p><p> </p><p>TWO OTHER AL-MARZOUKS PLAY PROMINENT ROLES AT THE </p><p>NEWSPAPER.  COUSIN AHDI AL-MARZOUK HAS SERVED AS </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF "AL-ANBA" AND </p><p>KHALED\'S DAUGHTER BIBI, A PEPPERDINE UNIVERSITY </p><p>GRADUATE, IS DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER AND LARGELY RUNS </p><p>THE PAPER DURING THE FREQUENT INTERVALS THAT UNCLE </p><p>FAISAL IS TRAVELLING ON BUSINESS.  BIBI IS ONE OF ONLY </p><p>THREE WOMEN IN IMPORTANT POSITIONS IN THE KUWAITI </p><p>MEDIA.  INTERESTINGLY, ONE OF THE OTHER TWO IS HER </p><p>OLDER SECOND COUSIN, GHUNAIMA FAHED AL-MARZOUK, OWNER </p><p>AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE GLOSSY WOMEN\'S MAGAZINE </p><p>"OSRATI". </p><p> </p><p>THE REMAINING 16 PERCENT OF THE KUWAIT PRESS HOUSE </p><p>COMPANY IS HELD BY ABOUT 40 INDIVIDUALS, OF WHICH </p><p>SEVERAL ARE MEMBERS OF THE AL-FULAIJ FAMILY (ALSO </p><p>ORIGINALLY MEMBERS OF THE SUBAY TRIBE AND HISTORICALLY </p><p>BOTH BUSINESS AND MARRIAGE PARTNERS OF THE AL-MARZOUKS) </p><p>INCLUDING UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA GRADUATE GHAZI </p><p>AL-FULAIJ, VICE CHAIRMAN OF "AL-ANBA", HIS BROTHER </p><p>FAISAL AL-FULAIJ AND THEIR COUSIN KHALED AL-FULAIJ ALI. </p><p> </p><p>"AL-ANBA" IS, ALONG WITH "AL-SIYASSAH", LESS CRITICAL </p><p>OF US FOREIGN POLICY AND LESS CRITICAL OF THE STATUS </p><p>QUO IN KUWAIT THAN THE OTHER THREE DAILIES.  THE PAPER </p><p>HAS TILTED TOWARDS IRAQ IN THE IRAN-IRAQ AND </p><p>SYRIAN-IRAQI STRUGGLE AND HAS HARSHLY CRITICIZED SYRIAN </p><p>INTERVENTION IN LEBANON FOR YEARS (THEY ALSO HAVE </p><p>SEVERAL ANTI-BA\'ATH SYRIAN EXILES ON THEIR PAYROLL). </p><p>FAISAL AND BIBI HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY EXTREMELY </p><p>ANTAGONISTIC TO WHAT THEY REGARD AS KUWAITI SHIA </p><p>TROUBLE-MAKING IN THE COUNTRY.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE </p><p>PAPER\'S OFFICES WERE BOMBED IN JUNE 1976 AS A RESULT OF </p><p>LOCAL BUSINESS FEUDS.  IN THE 1980S, BOARD MEMBER </p><p>KHALED YUSUF AL-MARZOUK WAS THE OBJECT OF A BUNGLED </p><p>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IN SPAIN THAT KILLED HIS DRIVER. </p><p>THE ATTACKERS WERE SUPPOSEDLY PRO-IRANIAN ELEMENTS.  IN </p><p>THE 1985 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, THE PAPER STRONGLY </p><p>SUPPORTED RELATIVELY CONSERVATIVE, NON-FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>CANDIDATES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  CONCLUSION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>KUWAIT, WITH A POPULATION OF ALMOST TWO MILLION (27.9 </p><p>PERCENT OF THEM KUWAITIS) SEEMS TOO SMALL A MARKET FOR </p><p>FIVE NEWSPAPERS WITH A CLAIMED COMBINED CIRCULATION OF </p><p>405,000 COPIES.  EVEN ALLOWING FOR THE PAPERS\' REGIONAL </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL SALES, THE REAL FIGURE IS CLOSER TO </p><p>300,000.  A SHORT-TERM FORECAST WOULD POINT TO A </p><p>FURTHER CONSOLIDATION OF THEIR MARKET SHARE BY THE BIG </p><p>THREE ("AL-ANBA", "AL-QABAS" AND "AL-WATAN") WITH </p><p>PERHAPS "AL-SIYASSAH" EVENTUALLY ABSORBING "AL-RAI </p><p>AL-AAM" AFTER THE DEATH OF ABDULAZIZ AL-MUSAEED. </p><p> </p><p>ON THE POLITICAL FRONT, THE GOK CONFRONTS A DAILY </p><p>ARABIC PRESS WHICH, WHILE TEMPORARILY CURBED BY </p><p>CENSORSHIP, NEVERTHELESS TENDS TO BE PRO-DEMOCRACY, TO </p><p>REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE SUNNI MERCHANT ELITE, </p><p>AND TO STAND IN OPPOSITION TO INCREASED AL-SABAH </p><p>AUTOCRACY.  THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT A RESTORATION OF </p><p>FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, AS IT EXISTED PRIOR TO1986, </p><p>WOULD BRING ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE RESURRECION OF AN </p><p>ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH LEAING NEWSPAPERS </p><p>WOULD CHIP AWAY AT AL-SABAH PRROGATIVES.  THIS IS </p><p>PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAPEN FOR A LONG TIME, IF EVER. </p><p>AS WITH RESTORATON OF THE PARLIAMENT HOWEVER, THE GOK </p><p>IS UNLIELY TO FULLY TAKE THE LID OFF THE PRESS OR </p><p>RELA OTHER INTERNAL CONTROLS AS LONG AS IT REMAINS </p><p>ERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THREAT OF INTERNAL </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        KUWAIT  05979  08 OF 08  021205Z </p><p> </p><p>SUBVERSION.  THIS, IN TURN, IS LIKELY TO BE A </p><p>TOP-PRIORITY CONCERN AS LONG AS THE INTERNAL ITUATION </p><p>IN IRAN REMAINS UNSTABLE AND THERE IS O NEGOTIATED </p><p>SETTLEMENT OF THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR </p><p>HOWELL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
