<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GABORONE 003435 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: (X1) </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PTER, BC </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS01:  BOTSWANA MUSLIM ATTITUDES </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A)STATE 177569, (B)STATE 175484, (C)GABORONE 3315 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON OFFICER AARON TARVER, REASON </p><p>1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) POST HAS ACTIVELY SOUGHT OUT MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN BOTSWANA TO GAUGE ATTITUDES TOWARDS </p><p>U.S. ACTIONS IN COMBATING TERRORISM FOLLOWING THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS AND FOLLOWING COMMENCEMENT OF </p><p>MILITARY ACTION IN AFGHANISTAN (REFS B, C).  MUSLIM </p><p>COMMUNITY LEADERS HAVE DELAYED MEETING WITH US, AND HAVE </p><p>EXPRESSED UNEASE AT THE PROSPECT, AS THE MEETING WILL </p><p>LIKELY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES OF OPINION. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, POST HAS SECURED A MEETING WITH MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE BOTSWANA MUSLIM ASSOCIATION FOR OCTOBER 24, AND WILL </p><p>REPORT ON THAT MEETING SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>POST\'S RESPONSES TO REFTEL A ARE AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>INDICATORS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE MEDIA.  AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THERE ARE NO </p><p>MEDIA OUTLETS WITH A RADICAL ISLAMIC EDITORIAL POLICY. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED OF THE EXISTENCE OF </p><p>THE MUSLIM\'S CRESCENT NEWSPAPER, PURPORTEDLY EDITED BY A </p><p>MR. ZAFAR BANGASH.  THE PUBLICATION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN </p><p>GENERAL CIRCULATION, AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT ANYWHERE IN </p><p>GABORONE OR FRANCISTOWN.  ACCORDING TO A REPORT IN THE </p><p>WEEKLY PAPER THE BOTSWANA GUARDIAN, MR. BANGASH RECENTLY </p><p>DELIVERED A LECTURE AT THE GABORONE MAIN MOSQUE URGING </p><p>ALL BOTSWANA\'S MUSLIMS "TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH </p><p>AFGHANISTAN."  (COMMENT:  WE WILL PRESS FURTHER TO FIND </p><p>OUT MORE ABOUT THE MUSLIM\'S CRESCENT.  AS THE BOTSWANA </p><p>GUARDIAN IS ONE OF THE MORE SENSATIONALISTIC PAPERS IN </p><p>BOTSWANA, WE ARE UNSURE HOW MUCH WEIGHT TO ATTRIBUTE TO </p><p>THIS REPORT.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ISLAMIC PREACHING/TEACHING.  TO THE BEST OF OUR </p><p>KNOWLEDGE, NO PREACHERS, MOSQUES, OR EDUCATIONAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS HAVE EMERGED AS CENTERS OF RADICALISM. </p><p>THERE ARE NO RADICAL MUSLIM BROADCASTS ON LOCAL RADIO </p><p>AND TV.  BOTSWANA TELEVISION (BTV) IS GOVERNMENT-OWNED, </p><p>AS ARE THE RADIO STATIONS THAT REACH THE LARGEST </p><p>PROPORTION OF LISTENERS IN BOTSWANA, RADIO BOTSWANA AND </p><p>RB2.  TWO INDEPENDENT RADIO STATIONS EXIST, GABZ-FM AND </p><p>YARONA-FM, AND ARE MORE POPULAR THAN STATE-OWNED RADIO, </p><p>BUT THESE HAVE ONLY A LIMITED BROADCASTING RANGE. </p><p>NEITHER STATION BROADCASTS ISLAMIC RADICALISM OVER THE </p><p>AIRWAVES, ALTHOUGH LOCAL CALL-IN TALK SHOWS GIVE </p><p>ANONYMOUS CALLERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VENT ANTI-AMERICAN </p><p>SENTIMENT AT TIMES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) POLITICAL PARTIES.  THERE IS NO POLITICAL PARTY </p><p>IDENTIFIED WITH ISLAMIC RADICALISM IN BOTSWANA.  THE </p><p>LEADING OPPOSITION PARTY, THE BOTSWANA NATIONAL FRONT </p><p>(BNF), ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT ASKS ALL BATSWANA TO </p><p>"CONDEMN TERRORISM AND ALL ITS MANIFESTATIONS AND FORMS </p><p>EVEN IF IT IS PERPETUATED BY SUPERPOWERS, MIDDLE-SIZED </p><p>COUNTRIES, SMALL COUNTRIES, ORGANIZATIONS OR </p><p>INDIVIDUALS."  THE BNF IS A PARTY OF SOCIO-DEMOCRATIC </p><p>LEANINGS, BEGAN BY DR. KENNETH KOMA, WHO OBTAINED HIS </p><p>PH.D. IN THE SOVIET UNION IN THE 1960S.  THE BNF\'S </p><p>PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER IS MR. MOHAMMED KHAN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THERE ARE NO </p><p>KNOWN NGOS, CHARITABLE OR OTHERWISE, WITH KNOWN TIES TO </p><p>ISLAMIC RADICALISM.  WE KNOW OF ONE ORGANIZATION, THE </p><p>BOTSWANA MUSLIM ASSOCIATION (BMA), WHICH FOCUSES ON </p><p>ISSUES OF INTEREST TO MUSLIMS.  THE BMA EXECUTIVE BOARD </p><p>CONSISTS OF ABDUL SATAR DADA, PRESIDENT (DADA IS </p><p>TREASURER FOR THE RULING BOTSWANA DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND </p><p>THE ONLY NON-BLACK AFRICAN IN BOTSWANA\'S PARLIAMENT); </p><p>ISMAIL IBRAHIM, VICE-PRESIDENT; ABDUL MALEK MELAMU, </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL; MOHAMMED IQBAL CHAND, ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY; RIAZ PEERBHAI, TREASURER; AND SALIM KALA, </p><p>ASSISTANT TREASURER.  (SOURCE:  MIDWEEK SUN, 19 SEPT. </p><p>2001). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE BMA YOUTH WING, THE MUSLIM YOUTH MOVEMENT </p><p>(P.O. BOX 1903, GABORONE, BOTSWANA, TEL: +267 71-707- </p><p>870, A MOBILE PHONE NUMBER) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE </p><p>ENTITLED "USA:  HYPOCRITES!" RECITING SEVERAL "FACTS" </p><p>PURPORTING TO EXPLAIN WHY THE U.S.-LED CAMPAIGN AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM IS A "FANTASY," INCLUDING THE STATEMENT THAT </p><p>"IT IS ALSO A RECOGNIZED FACT IN THE ARAB WORLD THAT </p><p>THOSE BOMBINGS (OF THE U.S. EMBASSIES IN NAIROBI AND DAR </p><p>ES SALAAM) WERE PLANNED BY THE ISRAELIS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES. </p><p>WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVING </p><p>TIES TO RADICAL ISLAM.  THE FOUR MAJOR BANKS IN </p><p>BOTSWANA, BARCLAYS AND STANDARD CHARTERED, STANBIC AND </p><p>FINANCIAL BANK OF BOTSWANA, ARE BASED OUT OF THE UK AND </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA, RESPECTIVELY.  WE WILL BE MEETING WITH </p><p>EACH OF THOSE BANKS SHORTLY TO GAUGE PROGRESS IN </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1373.  WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS </p><p>(ORIGINALLY FROM THE RAPPORT, AN AFRIKAANS LANGUAGE </p><p>NEWSPAPER IN SOUTH AFRICA, REPRINTED IN THE CAPE TOWN </p><p>NEWS) THAT ONE OF TWO BUSINESSMEN INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>WATERVAL ISLAMIC INSTITUTE IN MIDRAND, GAUTENG, HAS TIES </p><p>TO THE BANKING INDUSTRY OF BOTSWANA.  RSO AND THE </p><p>BOTSWANA SPECIAL BRANCH OF THEIR POLICE SERVICE ARE </p><p>FOLLOWING UP ON THIS ALLEGATION, BUT HAVE TURNED UP NO </p><p>NEW INFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) SCHOLARSHIPS FOR STUDY ABROAD.  WE HAVE NO </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE LOCAL MUSLIM STUDENTS ARE SENT </p><p>ABROAD FOR STUDY.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME BATSWANA MAY </p><p>HAVE RECEIVED SCHOLARSHIPS TO STUDY IN LIBYA, WHICH HAS </p><p>AN EMBASSY HERE, BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCHOLARSHIPS </p><p>FOR STUDY EMANATE FROM THE GOB, WHICH SENDS THE LARGE </p><p>MAJORITY OF ITS SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS TO THE UK AND THE </p><p>U.S.  A SMALL MINORITY WERE SENT TO STUDY AT AN </p><p>ENGINEERING COLLEGE IN MALAYSIA, BUT A NUMBER OF THOSE </p><p>STUDENTS WERE EXPELLED AFTER THEY STAGED A WALKOUT </p><p>COMPLAINING THAT THEIR COLLEGE WAS IN FACT A SHOPPING </p><p>MALL IN MALAYSIA. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) FOREIGN ITINERANTS.  WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF </p><p>FOREIGN ITINERANTS WITH KNOWN OR RUMORED TIES TO RADICAL </p><p>ISLAM LIVING IN OR REGULARLY TRANSITING THE COUNTRY. </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S BORDERS, HOWEVER, ARE QUITE POROUS, AND </p><p>BOTSWANA\'S GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO </p><p>KNOW IF ITINERANTS ARE TRANSITING THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) CONTACT INFORMATION AND RUMORS.  RSO CONTACTS </p><p>NOTED WITH SURPRISE REPORTS THAT THE BMA WAS UNABLE TO </p><p>REACH A CONSENSUS ON ISSUING A STATEMENT OF CONDOLENCE </p><p>AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACK.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>SOURCE, DADA BASICALLY "BOUGHT HIS WAY IN" TO THE BMA, </p><p>AND CONTROLLED THE ORGANIZATION.  SOURCE THEORIZED THAT </p><p>EITHER DADA TRULY DID NOT WANT A CONDOLENCE STATEMENT </p><p>ISSUED (CONTRARY TO HIS STATEMENT TO AMBASSADOR AND </p><p>DCM), OR THAT THE YOUTH WING BOTSWANA MUSLIM MOVEMENT IS </p><p>EXERTING MORE AUTHORITY WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION THAN </p><p>MAINSTREAM BMA MEMBERS ANTICIPATED. </p><p> </p><p>LANGE </p><p></p></div>
