<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001559 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB, PM, INL, S/CT, WHA/PPC, AND WHA/CEN </p><p>PANAMA FOR CUSTOMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, SNAR, ETRD, PGOV, PREL, ELAB, EAGR, EWWT, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY HIGHLIGHTS INADEQUATE PORT SECURITY AT </p><p>PUERTO CORTES; GOH FINALLY ADDRESSING ISSUE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer; </p><p>reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  On June 14, 2003, Honduras Desk Officer and </p><p>PolOff met with Puerto Cortes Superintendent Antonio Cruz to </p><p>discuss the problematic security situation at the port. </p><p>Puerto Cortes is both the largest port in Honduras and on the </p><p>Caribbean coast of Central America.  Port officials </p><p>acknowledged the lack of security and cited insufficient </p><p>resources as the major impediment to compliance with the new </p><p>U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act, which requires </p><p>ports exporting cargo to the U.S. to meet specific security </p><p>standards and International Maritime Organization (IMO) </p><p>regulations.  Current security procedures at the port are </p><p>virtually non-existent.  During the meeting and a subsequent </p><p>impromptu press conference, DeskOff underscored the </p><p>importance of complying with new U.S. security regulations </p><p>and emphasized that the onus is on Hondurans to make the </p><p>necessary changes.  Minister of the Presidency Luis Cosenza </p><p>has designated Presidential Advisor Mauro Membreno as the GOH </p><p>point person on this issue.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>DeskOff/PolOff Meet with Puerto Cortes Superintendent </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On June 14, 2003, WHA/CEN Desk Officer for Honduras </p><p>and PolOff met with Puerto Cortes Superintendent Antonio Cruz </p><p>and Vice Manager Fermin Boquin to discuss the problematic </p><p>security situation at the port.  Port officials acknowledged </p><p>the lack of security and cited insufficient resources as the </p><p>major impediment to compliance with the new U.S. Maritime </p><p>Transportation Security Act, which requires ports exporting </p><p>cargo to the U.S. to meet specific security standards and IMO </p><p>regulations.  More worrisome, current security procedures at </p><p>the port are virtually non-existent.  During the meeting and </p><p>subsequent impromptu press conference, DeskOff underscored </p><p>the importance of complying with new U.S. security </p><p>regulations and emphasized that the onus is on Hondurans to </p><p>make the necessary changes. U.S.-donated counternarcotics </p><p>canines, costing USD 35,000 apiece, are not currently being </p><p>used to inspect outbound cargoes, and port managers were </p><p>unable to enumerate in detail the specific procedures for </p><p>inspecting containers.  A Power Point presentation delivered </p><p>by port officials offered a laundry list of resources needed </p><p>for compliance, implying that the U.S. should fund these </p><p>requests.  When asked whether the U.S. was planning to fund </p><p>the security modifications, DeskOff indicated that the U.S. </p><p>would offer support of some kind but that the nature of the </p><p>support had not yet been determined. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Puerto Cortes is both the largest port in Honduras </p><p>and on the Caribbean coast of Central America.  It provides </p><p>port services to companies from Guatemala, El Salvador and </p><p>Nicaragua, while serving as a distribution and manufacturing </p><p>site for the surrounding agricultural regions from which over </p><p>1,800,000 containers on more than 1,700 ships were </p><p>transported in 2002.  Puerto Cortes can dock up to ten </p><p>vessels at once.  More than 1,000 ships travel from Puerto </p><p>Cortes to the U.S. annually, and many others travel to </p><p>Europe, Africa and South America.  Puerto Cortes yielded </p><p>revenues of approximately USD 81.4 million in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>GOH Expresses Concern over Inadequate Port Security </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The unacceptable port security situation in Puerto </p><p>Cortes finally captured the attention of the most senior </p><p>levels of the Maduro government in late May.  Minister of the </p><p>Presidency Luis Cosenza met with EmbOffs to ask for U.S. </p><p>assistance in addressing the problem.  His request came in </p><p>the wake of a sobering preliminary assessment (which included </p><p>an estimated USD 1-3 million price tag for the minimum </p><p>security improvements to meet the new legal requirements) </p><p>from a private U.S. port security consultant who works with </p><p>the International Maritime Organization.  Cosenza\'s request </p><p>and designation of Presidential Advisor Mauro Membreno as the </p><p>GOH point person on this issue are encouraging signs that the </p><p>GOH is finally going to treat this issue as high priority. </p><p> </p><p>GOH Slow to Act But Headed in Right Direction </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment:  Cosenza and Membreno\'s willingness to take </p><p>control of the issue is a very welcome sign of the serious </p><p>political will needed to tackle this difficult issue. </p><p>Membreno\'s reputation as a highly capable and well-connected </p><p>political fixer renders him a good choice for the position. </p><p>At the same time, Membreno is regarded as a charter member of </p><p>the dark side of the Nationalist Party.  He will need those </p><p>credentials in order to tackle vested interests within his </p><p>own party, such as Vice President Diaz Lobo, and the port </p><p>labor union if the GOH is to make the necessary changes for </p><p>Puerto Cortes to be certified under the new U.S. Maritime </p><p>Transportation Security Act.  The GOH finally seems to </p><p>understand that fixing the port\'s security is not as simple </p><p>as getting U.S. Customs to open an office at Puerto Cortes. </p><p>This is critical since the new U.S. law will impose a </p><p>complete shutoff of shipping to the U.S. from any port that </p><p>is not certified by July 1, 2004.  End Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
