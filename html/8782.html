<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000713 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PHUM, PREL, BM, Human Rights, ASSK, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: ICRC EXPECTS TO SEE ASSK AND OTHER DETAINED NLD </p><p>LEADERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 696 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: ICRC expects to visit Aung San Suu Kyi and </p><p>the other detained NLD leaders within the next few days. </p><p>Meanwhile, the universities have reopened and Rangoon remains </p><p>quiet. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>ICRC To See ASSK and Other NLD Leaders </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ICRC officers have advised us that ICRC has been given </p><p>permission to see Aung San Suu Kyi and the other NLD leaders </p><p>who were detained following the May 30 ambush in Depeyin. </p><p>ICRC officials are to meet with GOB representatives today or </p><p>tommorow to work out the modalities for the visits, which </p><p>will probably take place during the weekend of June 21 and 22. </p><p> </p><p>Detainees Released </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In a diplomatic note dated June 13, the GOB said that </p><p>it had released 46 persons who had been detained in </p><p>connection with the May 30 attack in Depeyin.  Twenty-five </p><p>people were released on June 11; 21 on June 12.  Apparently, </p><p>however, none of the persons released were picked up at the </p><p>scene of the attack.  From information we have been able to </p><p>gather, all appear to have been detained after the event as </p><p>the GOB searched for signs of a conspiracy. </p><p> </p><p>Universities Open; Rangoon Quiet </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Universities and secondary schools reopened throughout </p><p>Burma on June 16.  Thus far, the country remains quiet.  With </p><p>the exception of a very few small and isolated </p><p>demonstrations, the public has not taken to the streets to </p><p>protest the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi or the closure of </p><p>the NLD offices.  Some preliminary security arrangements have </p><p>been put in place in Rangoon (e.g.; some additional barbed </p><p>wire at Rangoon\'s city hall and a few more MI surveillance </p><p>units on the street), but there are no signs yet that the </p><p>government anticipates any serious trouble. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
