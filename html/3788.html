<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002727 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  KANO GOVERNOR ON OBASANJO PERFORMANCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  During a September 5 call on Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, Kano State Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso offered his </p><p>assessment of the Obasanjo Presidency and urged continued </p><p>USG support for Nigerian democratization.  Kwankwaso, </p><p>Nigeria\'s youngest state governor and at the helm of the </p><p>nation\'s largest state in population and territory, was </p><p>confident of his own standing and appears well-positioned </p><p>for the upcoming round of elections.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Kano State Governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, </p><p>accompanied by the Special Advisor for Metropolitan Affairs </p><p>Akilu Indabawa and the state\'s Health Commissioner, paid a </p><p>call on Ambassador Jeter on 5 September during one of the </p><p>Governor\'s visits to Abuja.  Responding to Ambassador </p><p>Jeter\'s questions, Kwankwaso and his companions expounded </p><p>on the current political problems facing the Obasanjo </p><p>Presidency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Kwankaso said that many of Nigeria\'s problems </p><p>stemmed from the pace of transition from military to </p><p>civilian rule.  Obasanjo had been out of touch with </p><p>politicians since stepping down as military ruler in 1979 </p><p>and that fact, coupled with his incarceration and possible </p><p>torture late in the Abacha regime, meant that he was not </p><p>sufficiently involved in politics and was thus ill-prepared </p><p>to assume leadership of the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Further, Kwankwaso noted, the pot was boiling </p><p>because Nigeria had never successfully had a transition </p><p>between two democratically-elected civilian governments. </p><p>In some ways, conducting credible elections in 2003 will be </p><p>more difficult than in 1999.  Moreover, the failure of past </p><p>democratic experiments has dissuaded many able people from </p><p>political participation.  This has had a leveling effect on </p><p>the quality of governance and political discourse in the </p><p>country.  In Kwankwaso\'s assessment, the 2003 elections and </p><p>the subseqquent round in 2007 will likely continue to </p><p>attract the self-interested politicians who dominate </p><p>Nigerian politics today.  For instance, the genesis of the </p><p>impeachment crisis is the lack of understanding among </p><p>relatively inexperienced politicians of the appropriate </p><p>relationship between political parties and the government. </p><p>Kwankwaso said that the presidential system lessens party </p><p>control over the workings of government and was radically </p><p>different from the parliamentary system, where party </p><p>loyalty is a necessity in defining and directing the </p><p>government\'s goals.  Rather than building civil society, </p><p>the USG focus its assistance on fostering a deeper </p><p>understanding of the role of the parties in a presidential </p><p>system, the Kano Governor explained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Kwankwaso believed Obasanjo was a sincere patriot </p><p>with Nigeria\'s best interests at heart, but the uneven </p><p>wisdom of his appointments and the structure of the </p><p>Presidency "reflects on the quality of his leadership." </p><p>The Governor rightly pointed out that some among the </p><p>Cabinet were "losers in their own districts," unable to be </p><p>elected on their own merits.  Others were appointed by </p><p>Obasanjo to balance the myriad competing political, </p><p>regional and ethnic interests in Nigeria.  Unfortunately, </p><p>in Kwankwaso\'s opinion, Obasanjo\'s assessment of these </p><p>interests was off the mark, based on his own incomplete </p><p>understanding of political developments in Nigeria in </p><p>recent years.  Kwankwaso identified the most serious </p><p>problem for the Presidency as communications, both </p><p>domestically and with the outside world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The Health Commissioner commented the number of </p><p>Ministers and Special Advisors in the Presidency, which he </p><p>figured at about 100, created an uncontrollable </p><p>bureaucracy.  With each person pursuing his own interests, </p><p>no one was looking out for the interests of the President. </p><p>Kwankwaso asked rhetorically, "Where have the Ministers and </p><p>Advisors been while the Legislature was calling for </p><p>Obasanjo\'s impeachment?  Invisible!"  While each one should </p><p>be selling the merits of Obasanjo\'s leadership and </p><p>highlighting his accomplishments, they have all gone </p><p>aground, waiting for the air to clear and figuring how to </p><p>maximize their own individual interests in the aftermath. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Communications with the public has been no better. </p><p>In Kano, Kwankwaso complained, it was Kano State personnel </p><p>who identified projects initiated by Federal authorities in </p><p>order to publicize them to the voters.  "The Ministers </p><p>should be touting the government\'s accomplishments to the </p><p>electorate in order to improve the image of their boss," </p><p>Kwankwaso lamented.  Instead, when anyone gets credit, it </p><p>is usually the Minister rather than the Administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  On the upcoming elections, and despite his </p><p>criticism of the President, Kwankwaso was confident that he </p><p>could deliver Kano to Obasanjo, regardless of who runs </p><p>against him.  The Health Commissioner commented, however, </p><p>that Obasanjo was making a serious mistake by ignoring the </p><p>North.  "Kano is the most populous state in the country, </p><p>and the Hausa-Fulani are the most populous tribe," he said. </p><p>He was perplexed by Obasanjo\'s perceived inattention to the </p><p>political needs of this important region.  When Ambassador </p><p>Jeter asked whether press reports that the President was </p><p>losing support in the north because of his prosecution of </p><p>Mohammed Abacha, Kwankwaso sniffed, "Keeping him in jail </p><p>bothers no one."  Contending that Kano indigenes had no </p><p>love for the Abacha family, he said that, conversely, </p><p>letting Abacha out could be a blow to Obasanjo\'s popularity </p><p>and credibility.  And in response to Ambassador\'s question </p><p>about House of Representatives Speaker Na\'abba\'s chances </p><p>for reelection, Kwankwaso pointedly asked, "Do you want him </p><p>to return?"  The implication that the Governor could derail </p><p>Na\'abba\'s political career was seconded by Indabawa, who </p><p>commented that anyone supported by Kwankwaso was virtually </p><p>assured of election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COMMENT:  Kwankwaso appeared relaxed and confident </p><p>about his future political prospects and prowess.  Like </p><p>other Northerners who back Obasanjo, Kwankwaso is not </p><p>enamored with the President and is full of criticism of his </p><p>Administration; however he likely views the President as a </p><p>known quantity and the lesser evil among the many possible </p><p>candidates.  His assessment of the weaknesses of Obasanjo\'s </p><p>Administration is telling and tracks with our own: a </p><p>Presidency staffed with too many uncoordinated Special </p><p>Assistants and Advisors, most with no clear mandate about </p><p>their respective portfolios, no vision or clear message, </p><p>and an extraordinary inability to sell the man who leads </p><p>the nation from Aso Rock. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
