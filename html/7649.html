<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002666 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S HEADSCARF ISSUE OPENS ANOTHER POLITICAL </p><p>RIFT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting DCM Frank Ward. Reason: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Islamist headscarf remains a threatening </p><p>symbol for the Kemalist state. In inviting headscarved women </p><p>to a reception in honor of the children\'s holiday, AK Party </p><p>Speaker of Parliament Arinc has widened a rift between the </p><p>GOT and the Turkish Establishment.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc hosted an April 23 </p><p>reception in honor of Turkey\'s national children\'s holiday. </p><p>For the first time in 83 years, the President, TGS chief, </p><p>opposition party members and other high-ranking bureaucrats </p><p>all boycotted the event, ostensibly because Arinc\'s </p><p>headscarved wife\'s name appeared on the original invitation </p><p>as a co-host.  Air Force commander Asparuk asked reporters </p><p>rhetorically before the reception, "does this (the </p><p>invitation) mean that we will have to bring our wives covered </p><p>from head to toe?  Of course I am not going." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In the event, Arinc\'s wife -- and most of the </p><p>headscarved wives of senior AK officials including P.M. </p><p>Erdogan -- did not attend (note: there were 5-10 headscarved </p><p>wives in attendance. end note.).  Pouring gas on the fire, </p><p>however, Arinc and Erdogan took turns lambasting those who </p><p>did not attend.  Calling them "irresponsible," Arinc said </p><p>that those "attempting to cast a shadow on the holiday have </p><p>failed;" Erdogan went further, saying "our country will not </p><p>forgive them." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Arinc, the Lightning Rod </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Even as he touts his role as an above-the-fray figure, </p><p>Arinc has repeatedly used his somewhat insulated position to </p><p>appeal to the hearts and minds of AK grassroots and to </p><p>challenge the status quo.  Whether Arinc hopes to use the </p><p>Speakership as a springboard to a higher office like P.M. or </p><p>President remains an open question.  In this case, although </p><p>Arinc announced his wife would not attend the function, he </p><p>did so mere hours before it began -- pointedly after it was </p><p>clear that the generals and others were not going to attend. </p><p>Moreover, in a speech at a symposium on constitutional law </p><p>this week, Arinc suggested that "positive norms such as </p><p>fairness are more important than constitutional law." </p><p>Arinc\'s statement no doubt received kudos from AK supporters </p><p>clamoring for fundamental changes to the constitution.  At </p><p>the same time, however, it was a clear challenge to the more </p><p>Establishment-minded officials in attendance, who hold the </p><p>document to be sacred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Comment: Escalating tension </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) This most recent incident occurred against the </p><p>backdrop of a series of GOT policies that have raised the </p><p>hackles of a Turkish secular Establishment worried about the </p><p>influence of "political Islam" in State organs.  Press </p><p>reports this week have focused on AK\'s efforts to place its </p><p>supporters in the highest levels of the bureaucracy -- a </p><p>traditional Turkish political practice.  Media outlets have </p><p>also highlighted a foreign ministry circular, which </p><p>reportedly requires Turkish embassies abroad to reach out to </p><p>the heretofore taboo Islamist foundation Milli Gorus </p><p>(National View) and Fetullah Gulen\'s Nur movement.  All eyes </p><p>will now be on the April 30 NSC meeting, which will discuss </p><p>acording to the press, "government practices and appointments </p><p>of new bureaucrats" -- but which could also be the first real </p><p>showdown between the two camps since Erdogan became P.M. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
