<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001705 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Jordanian papers published today, March 21, are </p><p>dominated by reports on the war with Iraq.  Wire </p><p>service reports highlight the bombing of Baghdad and </p><p>President Saddam Hussein\'s televised speech to the </p><p>Iraqi people.  All papers also highlight King </p><p>Abdullah\'s meeting with the State Security Council, </p><p>during which he expressed concern for the welfare of </p><p>the Iraqi people and pledged Jordanian humanitarian </p><p>support, stressing Jordan\'s support for Iraq\'s </p><p>territorial unity.  Another lead story highlights </p><p>Jordan\'s official denial of earlier reports quoting </p><p>Iraqi sources that the Iraqis thwarted an American </p><p>military attack across the Jordanian-Iraqi border. </p><p>Also, the Minister of Information declared the eastern </p><p>part of the Kingdom a closed military area that </p><p>requires an official permit to enter.  Other lead </p><p>stories include reports of the anti-war demonstrations </p><p>that took place in various areas in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The American aggression against Iraq and the end </p><p>of the world order" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/21):  "The American missiles launched by U.S. </p><p>President George Bush against Iraq do not suggest </p><p>changing the Iraqi regime only, but also changing the </p><p>world order, that has prevailed and guaranteed </p><p>relative peace in the world for five decades..  The </p><p>U.S. administration chose to leave the world order, to </p><p>bash international law and international legitimacy, </p><p>to take the world back to the law of survival of the </p><p>fittest, simply by ignoring the United Nations and the </p><p>Security Council, and to launch an aggressive attack </p><p>against Iraq in contradiction of the simplest rules of </p><p>international law..  As of now, world countries must </p><p>realize that they no longer live under the umbrella of </p><p>international law, but under the law of power and the </p><p>rule of the jungle.  Therefore, their national </p><p>security is gone;   Israel, for example,  may attempt </p><p>some blatantly stupid actions such as invading </p><p>Palestinian territories, expelling the people, </p><p>attacking Syria and Lebanon, and carrying out other </p><p>actions of aggression, which we had believed that the </p><p>world would not allow." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Arabs must be active in the post-Saddam era" </p><p> </p><p>Former Jordanian Minister of Information Saleh Qallab </p><p>writes on the op-ed page of semi-official, influential </p><p>Arabic daily Al-Rai (03/21):  "This is exactly what </p><p>was expected.  The Iraqi crisis reached the finish </p><p>line.  The need to violently undo the knot that could </p><p>have been undone peacefully has become the only </p><p>option.  The worst of the matter is that the defense </p><p>policy that the Arabs have adopted put them where they </p><p>are today: a major Arab country is facing an unknown </p><p>fate and they are incapable of doing anything..  The </p><p>Iraqi President may have or may have not realized that </p><p>the Security Council\'s battles and the confrontation </p><p>between the United States and its allies on one hand </p><p>and France and its supporters on the other had nothing </p><p>to do with Iraq or with international legitimacy. </p><p>Rather they were the outcome of conflicting interests </p><p>for the purpose of creating another world power that </p><p>balances the United States.  Saddam Hussein\'s mistake </p><p>was that instead of taking his already targeted </p><p>country away from these world conflicts, he placed </p><p>Iraq right in the middle of the storm and turned it </p><p>into a battlefield for the conflicting parties.  The </p><p>outcome is that the United States, which would not </p><p>have the single superpower formula altered, turned its </p><p>back to all and moved towards war.  What happened has </p><p>happened and matters are where they are now.  The </p><p>question is what can the Arabs do?  It is not </p><p>permissible for the future of a brotherly Arab </p><p>country, of such a size and such an importance, to be </p><p>decided in the absence of the Arab viewpoint." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A war crime" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Ibrahim Absi writes on the back page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/21):  "Had the world been free, moral and </p><p>concerned for people\'s rights to life, freedom, </p><p>security, peace, justice and democracy, and were it </p><p>not subject to American threats and bribes, it would </p><p>have declared a decisive stand against the criminal </p><p>war being perpetrated by the U.S. administration </p><p>against Iraq and the Iraqi people, and it would have </p><p>declared its rebellion against the American tyranny </p><p>that surpassed all levels..  The new American crime </p><p>represented by this crazy war being perpetrated by the </p><p>U.S and British administration against the Iraqi </p><p>people is the dirtiest and bloodiest and deserves the </p><p>name `the mother of all crimes\'." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Invading the world" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Yaqoub Jaber writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/21):  "The invasion of Iraq by the United States </p><p>is nothing but part of a wide-scale invasion to </p><p>control the world.  The plan to invade Iraq is not a </p><p>direct outcome of the September 11 attacks, but rather </p><p>an old plan put in place by the hawks of the current </p><p>U.S. administration before they came to power..  The </p><p>United States controls most of the oil routes and now </p><p>seeks to control what left of these routes under the </p><p>pretext of combating terrorism.  Invading Iraqi is </p><p>nothing but part of this hellish scheme, which must be </p><p>resisted via a coalition including Europe, China, </p><p>Russia and all countries keen to protect their </p><p>independence and dignity." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
