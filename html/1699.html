<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001072 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/11/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EFIN, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: BIG PROJECT, BIG PROBLEMS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE ANDREWS, REASONS 1.5(B/D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (C) The Senate Public Accounts Committee Chairman plans </p><p>public hearings on the massive sports stadium now under </p><p>construction on the edge of Abuja.  Unbudgeted by the </p><p>National Assembly, but (for now) privately financed by </p><p>contractors eager to please the Obasanjo government (with a </p><p>government loan guarantee attached), the ostensibly 38 </p><p>billion naira (USD 330 million) project raises troubling </p><p>questions of the unconstitutional usurpation of legislative </p><p>authority.  The Committee Chairman faces opposition from the </p><p>Executive, from Senate Leadership and from inside his own </p><p>committee in his quest to examine the project.  Suppression </p><p>of his efforts would demonstrate once again that transparency </p><p>and accountability are still lacking in government circles. </p><p>Successful public hearings, while potentially very </p><p>embarrassing for the executive, would begin to establish </p><p>those concepts in the public consciousness.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Let\'s Build a Stadium Now (And Find the Money Later) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>2.  (C) Poloff met with Senator Idris Abubakar, Chairman of </p><p>the powerful Public Accounts Committee, on May 9.  The </p><p>Committee examines the financial performance of all branches </p><p>of government.  When asked of the status of his Committee\'s </p><p>efforts to examine the performance of the Executive, Abubakar </p><p>replied that he had that very morning sent a memo forward to </p><p>Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim, setting forth the </p><p>Committee\'s plans to hold public hearings on the massive </p><p>sports stadium now under construction on the edge of Abuja. </p><p>No provision for the project exists in the FY 2001 budget (or </p><p>any previous budget).  The committee selected the project, </p><p>said Abubakar, as the most egregious example of Executive </p><p>usurpation of the spending authority of the Legislative </p><p>branch. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What It Will Cost, Nobody Knows </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) Abubakar explained that the contract for the stadium </p><p>(not shared with the committee despite repeated requests to </p><p>the Ministry of Public Works) was ostensibly for 38 billion </p><p>naira (about $330 million), "but we really don\'t know how </p><p>much it will cost."  The huge stadium is being constructed to </p><p>permit Abuja to host the 2003 All-Africa games.  Other </p><p>athletic facilities are part of the overall project, as is a </p><p>nearby "Athletes\' Village".  The contractors involved, </p><p>including major international companies long resident in </p><p>Nigeria such as Bouygues and Berger, were privately financing </p><p>the project.  Despite the lack of any legislative approval, </p><p>said Abubakar, the Obasanjo Administration had given the </p><p>companies an open-ended loan guarantee for the project, to </p><p>enable the companies to "shop" the project with lenders. </p><p>"The companies are guaranteed payment no matter what the </p><p>terms they negotiate with the lenders," said Abubakar.  The </p><p>ultimate cost of the project was, then, "unknowable." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Let\'s Cooperate -- You Keep Quiet </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>4.  (C) Abubakar said that Senate President Anyim, on the </p><p>express request of President Obasanjo, had previously stymied </p><p>attempts by the Committee to investigate the project. </p><p>Referring to Anyim\'s clear preference for behind-the-scenes </p><p>communication with the Executive branch (in contrast to his </p><p>predecessor\'s provocative public disputes with Obasanjo), </p><p>Abubakar said, "this is the new \'cooperation\'.  We keep </p><p>quiet, and the President does what he wants." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Abubakar said that he expected strong opposition to </p><p>any public hearings from the Executive branch, from the </p><p>Senate President, and potentially from within his own </p><p>committee.  "Most of us (on the committee) are now for the </p><p>hearings, but who knows what will happen.  After all," he </p><p>said with a smile, "the chief fixer (Public Works Minister </p><p>Tony Anenih) is involved.  We are going to call him to </p><p>testify." (Note: Anenih is the principal political hatchet </p><p>man of the Obasanjo Administration, well-known for his </p><p>wealth-spreading habits when key votes or other matters are </p><p>before the National Assembly).  Abubakar acknowledged that he </p><p>planned an entire series of essentially unanswerable </p><p>questions for Anenih.  "What can he say when I ask him where </p><p>in the budget he finds authorization for the project? There </p><p>is no legal authority for it."  Abubakar did not offer an </p><p>opinion on what action the Senate might take in the wake of </p><p>such public hearings.  "Let,s hold the hearing first." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We Are Looking, But We Need to Look Forward, Not Back </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>6.  (C) Abubakar mentioned that his committee planned a </p><p>general audit of all executive accounts, beginning with FYs </p><p>97-99 (the last eighteen months of military rule, and the </p><p>first six months of the Obasanjo regime, employing the </p><p>previous regime\'s budget).  The Auditor-General of the </p><p>Federation, explicitly tasked by the Constitution with </p><p>auditing all government accounts and presenting them to the </p><p>National Assembly, was being helpful and attentive, and </p><p>assembling the various audits for the committee.  Various </p><p>government agencies were not so helpful, many having </p><p>"difficulty" complying with their legal responsibility to </p><p>give access to their financial statements to the </p><p>Accountant-General (who reports to the Auditor-General).  But </p><p>Abubakar stressed that these "backward-looking" audits were </p><p>politically easy. Everyone could support investigations of </p><p>military governments.   "We need to look forward.  It\'s time </p><p>we look at ourselves." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7.  (C) Abubakar is an opposition All People\'s Party senator, </p><p>head of a powerful committee with a majority People\'s </p><p>Democratic Party membership (the PDP controls the Senate with </p><p>sixty-four senators out of 109 total).  In a legislative body </p><p>with very weak party discipline, he is well-respected by his </p><p>PDP and Alliance for Democracy colleagues for his </p><p>intelligence and independent-mindedness.   He is also not </p><p>above making political capital out of what appears to us to </p><p>be a clear usurpation of constitutional authority by the </p><p>executive.  If Senate President Anyim, in league with the </p><p>Executive, squelches yet again the committee\'s stadium </p><p>investigation, we will have yet another example of how </p><p>accountability and transparency remain mere words with no </p><p>great practical implications in government circles. </p><p>Committee hearings would embarrass the executive, but also </p><p>reassert the essential principle of legislative oversight of </p><p>Executive performance. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
