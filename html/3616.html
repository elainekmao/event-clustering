(U) This cable contains an action request. Please see </p><p>paragraph 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During his August 28 meeting with Honduran Foreign </p><p>Minister Guillermo Perez-Cadalso, WHA A/S Otto Reich </p><p>reviewed the importance of an ICC Article 98 bilateral </p><p>agreement to the U.S. and reviewed the draft model text </p><p>for a bilateral agreement.  The FM told A/S Reich that </p><p>Honduras would work closely with the U.S. to address U.S. </p><p>concerns.  Reich also underscored the importance of the </p><p>Article 98 agreement to President Ricardo Maduro in a </p><p>separate meeting the same date.  Maduro understood the </p><p>logic of the U.S. position and indicated his preliminary </p><p>support.  In addition, A/S Reich covered the issue in his </p><p>August 28 meeting with Minister of Defense Fred Breve and </p><p>in a conversation with National Security Advisor Ramon </p><p>Medina Luna.  MFA officials assured Emboffs that Honduras </p><p>would be likely to conclude such an agreement with the </p><p>U.S.  (Note:  Ambassador presented reftel demarche to the </p><p>FM last week. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Separately, the FM alerted A/S Reich that Colombia </p><p>has proposed that the Rio Group meet to discuss and study </p><p>Article 98 agreements.  The FM said that the Colombians </p><p>might want a consensus Rio Group position on proposed </p><p>U.S. bilateral agreements under Article 98 of the Rome </p><p>Treaty.  Other MFA officials opined privately that the </p><p>Colombians were most likely seeking regional political </p><p>cover before proceeding with a bilateral agreement with </p><p>the U.S.  The Hondurans said that there was an effort to </p><p>organize a meeting of Rio Group FMs on this issue at the </p><p>UNGA. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) ACTION REQUEST FOR PM/AT: The MFA queried us as to </p><p>why we did not think that the existing 1954 U.S.-Honduran </p><p>bilateral agreement already provided sufficient </p><p>protections from ICC extradition requests for U.S. troops </p><p>based in or visiting Honduras.  Post will explore this </p><p>issue with Joint Task Force-Bravo lawyers, but requests </p><p>State\'s PM/AT provide input on the appropriate U.S. </p><p>response. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: MFA officials went to great lengths to </p><p>assure Emboffs that GOH would conclude an Article 98 </p><p>agreement with U.S.  They understand fully the importance </p><p>of this issue to the U.S.  We will push the GOH to be </p><p>among the first Latin American countries to sign an </p><p>agreement but upcoming UNGA travel schedules of key MFA </p><p>officials may impede a quick GOH review of the proposed </p><p>text and delay final GOH approval.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>ALMAGUER </p><p></p></div>
