(S) SUMMARY AND COMMENT.  WHILE PM BERLUSCONI\'S SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE US APPROACH TO IRAQ REMAINS RELIABLE, THE GOI - WITH </p><p>EXTREME CAUTION - IS LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR AN EVENTUAL </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE AND VOTE ON THE EXTENT OF ITALY\'S </p><p>SUPPORT. (REF A).  THE GOI CONTINUES TO WORK WITH US TO FIND </p><p>WAYS TO SAY "YES" TO OUR REQUESTS, BUT INCREASING PUBLIC AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY PRESSURE MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST PROCEED </p><p>CAUTIOUSLY AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW (REFS B, C, D).  POST </p><p>APPRECIATES EFFORTS TO IMPROVE INTERAGENCY COORDINATION AND </p><p>PROVIDE ADVANCE NOTICE.  OUR CONTACTS HAVE STRESSED THAT </p><p>EARLY NOTICE (24 HOURS AT A MINIMUM) AND CONTINUED </p><p>COORDINATION WITH MILITARY AND POLITICAL LEADERS IS THE BEST </p><p>WAY TO HELP ITALY TO HELP US.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE GOI IS WORKING TO ACCOMMODATE SEVERAL RECENT USG </p><p>MILITARY REQUESTS FOR OVERFLIGHT AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>IRAQ-RELATED CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS.  HOWEVER, SENIOR MOD AND </p><p>MFA OFFICIALS HAVE UNDERSCORED AGAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF CLOSE </p><p>COORDINATION AND ADVANCE NOTICE IN THE CURRENT SENSITIVE </p><p>POLITICAL CLIMATE.  EVEN OPERATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TREATED AS </p><p>ROUTINE IN THE PAST ARE SUBJECT TO CLOSER SCRUTINY.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, SHORT-NOTICE DELTA CONTRACT MILITARY TRANSPORT </p><p>FLIGHTS THROUGH CIVILIAN AIRPORTS ARE BEING REDIRECTED BY THE </p><p>GOI AWAY FROM ROME\'S MAIN AIRPORT BECAUSE OF THEIR GREATER </p><p>PUBLIC SENSITIVITY (SEE BELOW). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  IN A JANUARY 24 CONVERSATION WITH DCM, MFA POLITICAL </p><p>DIRECTOR GIANCARLO ARAGONA NOTED THAT ITALY IS UNDER </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00292  01 OF 02  241758Z </p><p>CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE FROM SOME EU MEMBERS TO MODULATE ITS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR POSSIBLE US MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ.  BANNER </p><p>HEADLINES IN THE ITALIAN PRESS (INACCURATELY) SPINNING WHITE </p><p>HOUSE STATEMENTS ABOUT ITALIAN SUPPORT MADE IT EVEN MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR ITALY TO POSITIVELY INFLUENCE EU POSITIONS, </p><p>ARAGONA SAID.  DEFENSE MINISTER MARTINO\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR </p><p>ECHOED ARAGONA\'S CONCERNS IN A JANUARY 24 MEETING WITH </p><p>A/POL-MIL COUNSELOR,  ADDING THAT IT WOULD BE A TOPIC OF </p><p>DISCUSSION AT A COUNCIL OF MINISTER\'S MEETING LATER THAT DAY. </p><p> EVEN THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER MENTIONED THE FEEDING FRENZY </p><p>IN THE PRESS TO THE DCM AT A JANUARY 23 EVENT, ADDING THAT </p><p>THE PM, DEFMIN, FM AND DEP. PM HAD AGREED AT A MINI CABINET </p><p>MEETING EARLIER IN THE DAY TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE USG </p><p>REQUEST FOR OVERFLIGHTS AND BASE ACCESS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PM BERLUSCONI AND OTHER MINISTERS, RESPONDING TO PRESS </p><p>INQUIRIES ABOUT THE REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON ON THURSDAY AND </p><p>FRIDAY, WERE CONSTRAINED TO EMPHASIZE THAT ITALY HAS MADE NO </p><p>DECISIONS ON MILITARY PARTICIPATION, THAT SUCH A DECISION </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE PARLIAMENT, AND THAT THE </p><p>GOI STRONGLY WISHES TO SEE EXPLICIT UN ENDORSEMENT OF ANY </p><p>MILITARY ACTION.  EMBASSY HAS CIRCULATED WIDELY, IN ENGLISH </p><p>AND IN ITALIAN, EXCERPTS FROM THE TRANSCRIPT SHOWING WHAT WAS </p><p>ACTUALLY SAID AT THE WASHINGTON PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT IT WILL </p><p>BE HARD TO ROLL BACK THE MISINTERPRETATIONS FOSTERED IN THE </p><p>PUBLIC AND MUCH OF PARLIAMENT. THAT THE TOP GOI OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>DISCUSSING WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE ROUTINE ACCESS REQUESTS IS </p><p>ONE SIGN THAT THE VOLATILE POLITICAL SCENE IS FORCING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO PROCEED VERY CAREFULLY, WITH AN EYE ON THE MOOD </p><p>OF THE PUBLIC, PARLIAMENT, AND ITS EU AND NATO ALLIES.  PUT </p><p>SIMPLY, THE GOVERNMENT FEELS OBLIGED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00292  01 OF 02  241758Z </p><p>HAS NOT SIMPLY HANDED A BLANK CHECK TO THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S)  THE GOI\'S JANUARY 24 DECISION TO REDIRECT DELTA </p><p>CONTRACT FLIGHTS TRANSPORTING ARMED AND UNIFORMED US MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL WITH WEAPONS AND AMMO FROM ROME\'S COMMERCIAL </p><p>AIRPORT (FIUMICINO) TO A MILITARY AIRFIELD (REF E) IS ANOTHER </p><p>SIGN THAT, WHILE WE CAN EXPECT GOI SUPPORT FOR OUR REQUESTS, </p><p>IT WILL NOT BE UNCONDITIONAL.  VCHOD\'S FIRST REACTION WHEN </p><p>BRIEFED BY DATT (WHO HAD LEARNED OF THE MATTER HOURS BEFORE) </p><p>THAT DELTA FLIGHTS WERE DUE TO BEGIN ARRIVING THE NEXT </p><p>MORNING AT FIUMICINO WAS DISBELIEF, FOLLOWED BY WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO MOVE THE MATTER FORWARD TO THE DEFMIN AND OTHER RELEVANT </p><p>MINISTRIES (MINISTRY OF INTERIOR, CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY). </p><p>LATER THAT EVENING, VCHOD NOTIFIED DATT THAT THE FLIGHTS </p><p>COULD NOT TRANSIT ITALIAN CIVIL AIRPORTS BUT OFFERED THE US </p><p>USE OF A MILITARY AIR BASE, SUCH AS SIGONELLA, AVIANO OR EVEN </p><p>PRACTICA DI MARE (20 KM SOUTH OF ROME).  (NOTE: EMBASSY IS </p><p>NOW COORDINATING WITH DELTA AND USAIRWAYS REPRESENTATIVES TO </p><p>REDIRECT THE FLIGHTS, WHICH REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN TRANSITING </p><p>TROOPS THROUGH ITALY SINCE JANUARY 21. END NOTE.)  BOTH VCHOD </p><p>AND DEFMIN\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR CAUTIONED THAT IT MAY BE </p><p>NECESSARY TO ADVISE PARLIAMENT AT LEAST 24 HOURS PRIOR TO </p><p>BEGINNING THE TRANSIT FLIGHTS.  LATE ON JANUARY 24, DEFMIN </p><p>MARTINO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE HAD INFORMED PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI AND PRESIDENT CIAMPI OF HIS DECISION TO PERMIT </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET        PTQ1260 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00292  02 OF 02  241758Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    FAAE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OMB-01   DHS-00   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------2B2F98  241758Z /38 </p><p>O 241727Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7813 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>S E C R E T SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000292 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MARR, EAIR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: KEEPING ITALIAN SUPPORT STRONG </p><p> </p><p>TRANSIT OF US MILITARY PERSONNEL THROUGH ITALIAN MILITARY </p><p>AIRFIELDS ONLY, AND THAT BOTH HAD RATIFIED HIS DECISION. </p><p> </p><p>6.
