<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000195 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA, EB, AND D </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, PREL, CE </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA: MAXIMUM POSSIBLE IMF ASSISTANCE NEEDED </p><p>TO SUPPORT PEACE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is an action request, please see paragraphs 4 and 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. The IMF is in the midst of finalizing a large-scale </p><p>Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for the </p><p>government of Sri Lanka (GSL).  Post understands the fund is </p><p>proposing a SDR 372 million (USD $510 million) package, </p><p>which equates to 90% of Sri Lanka\'s quota.  The 90% of quota </p><p>breaks down into 65% concessional PRGF funding and 25% on an </p><p>Extended Financial Facility (EFF) basis. </p><p> </p><p>3. Minster of Economic Reform Milinda Moragoda asked the </p><p>Ambassador on February 2 for US assistance in expanding the </p><p>size of the PRGF and raising the proportion of concessional </p><p>funding.  Specifically, GSL is looking for the PRGF to be </p><p>100% of its quota, which totals SDR 413 million (about USD </p><p>$566 million).  GSL would also like the proportion of </p><p>concessional PRGF financing in the facility, currently only </p><p>65% of quota, to be as high as possible.  Moragoda said GSL </p><p>was approaching the Japanese with the same request for </p><p>assistance on the PRGF. </p><p> </p><p>4. Action Request: Post sees merit in the GSL request and </p><p>asks the Department and concerned Washington agencies to </p><p>conduct the earliest possible review of the US position on </p><p>the proposed IMF package for Sri Lanka.  The PRGF will be </p><p>one of the main items of support offered at the June Tokyo </p><p>donor conference on Sri Lanka, at which the Deputy Secretary </p><p>has indicated he will be present.  We need the maximum </p><p>possible PRGF to support the economic growth that will be </p><p>critical to forging a lasting peace in Sri Lanka.  Post </p><p>understands the 65% figure for the level of concessional </p><p>funding is a "norm" that is exceeded in special cases.  Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s working toward peace after two decades of war ought </p><p>to qualify as a special case. </p><p> </p><p>5. Action Request, cont.: Post understands the IMF will be </p><p>finalizing this week the terms of the PRGF that will be </p><p>brought before the IMF board later in the month.  An </p><p>intervention this week, before February 7, will therefore be </p><p>necessary if the US is to influence the size and shape of </p><p>the facility. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
