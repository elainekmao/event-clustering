<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000223 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/CM, EAP/RSP/TC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, TW, CH, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  TAIWAN ECONOMICS MINISTER VISITS VIETNAM </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  A.  02 Hanoi 2417   B. 02 Hanoi 1290 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Taiwan Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu </p><p>visited Vietnam January 23 - 27 as the head of a trade </p><p>mission.  While his official host was the Vietnam Chamber of </p><p>Commerce and Industry, Lin held meetings with GVN officials, </p><p>including his counterparts at the Ministry of Trade as well </p><p>as the Ministry of Planning and Investment.  The two sides </p><p>discussed the past 10 years of cooperation as well as plans </p><p>for boosting future economic ties.  A Taiwan press report </p><p>indicated that a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) is a </p><p>possibility.  The visit was not publicized by Vietnam\'s </p><p>state-controlled media.  The PRC embassy reportedly made a </p><p>low-key objection to the GVN over the visit.  A conference </p><p>on Taiwan - Southeast Asia relations planned locally by the </p><p>Institute of China Studies for last July was cancelled after </p><p>strong PRC protests but should take place in Taiwan this </p><p>year.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>ROBUST ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL TIES </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  While the GVN is clearly on record as faithfully </p><p>adhering to "One China" (reftels), the robust economic and </p><p>cultural relationship between Vietnam and Taiwan remains </p><p>important.  By some accounts, Taiwan is the largest investor </p><p>in Vietnam.  (Note:  Other accounts put Singapore in first </p><p>place; however, much of that investment stems from regional </p><p>headquarters of third country firms, especially US oil </p><p>firms.  End note)  According to Dr. Do Tien Sam, Director of </p><p>the Institute of China Studies, Vietnam "greatly </p><p>appreciates" Taiwan investments, some of which, he observed, </p><p>are located in less developed parts of the country. </p><p>(Taiwanese businesspeople tell Embassy that they like doing </p><p>business in Vietnam and apparently that feeling is </p><p>reciprocated.  While some investments are in rural areas, </p><p>most are centered in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, including </p><p>several of the largest modern industrial zones in Vietnam.) </p><p>Two-way trade is also "very significant," reaching about USD </p><p>two billion in 2002, he added.  (Much of that is import of </p><p>materials for garment assembly and re-export of the finished </p><p>product.)  Labor exports are also increasing rapidly, with </p><p>some 60,000 Vietnamese workers going to Taiwan last year. </p><p>About 7,000 Vietnamese women married Taiwanese men last year </p><p>alone.  Over 300,000 Taiwanese tourists visit Vietnam every </p><p>year.  "Ties are strong and getting stronger," Dr. Sam </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>VISIT NOT UNPRECEDENTED </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Minister Lin\'s visit was not unprecedented, </p><p>according to Dr. Sam.  He noted that a previous incumbent, </p><p>whom he named as Jiang Bing Kun, visited Vietnam in his role </p><p>as Economics Minister twice.  Jiang also had a role in </p><p>signing two trade-related agreements - one on investment </p><p>protection and another on double taxation avoidance. </p><p>Separately, Robert Hsieh Bor-Huei of the Taipei Economic and </p><p>Cultural Office (TECO), claimed that Jiang had visited </p><p>Vietnam "nine or 10 times," although some of these were in a </p><p>private capacity.  Hsieh said that he had "heard" that the </p><p>PRC embassy predictably made a formal protest about Lin\'s </p><p>visit (although he was not clear whether to the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs or to the Ministry of Trade), calling it a </p><p>violation of "One China."  Foreign press reports also noted </p><p>that the PRC was unhappy about the visit.  Dr. Sam added </p><p>that "in adherence with "One China," no GVN visit to Taiwan </p><p>has ever gone above the deputy minister level.  Reflecting </p><p>Vietnam\'s pragmatic foreign policy approach, Dr. Sam </p><p>assessed that "we need to maintain our relations with the </p><p>PRC, but also strengthen those with Taiwan." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  According to Dr. Sam, Lin and his GVN </p><p>counterparts reviewed the past ten years of Vietnam - Taiwan </p><p>economic and cultural cooperation and discussed how these </p><p>relations could "be further strengthened in the coming </p><p>years."  A Taiwan press report noted that the two sides </p><p>investigated the possibility of a BTA and that Lin affirmed </p><p>Taiwan\'s support for Vietnam\'s accession to the World Trade </p><p>Organization.  TECO\'s Hsieh said that Vietnam and Taiwan had </p><p>been discussing the possibility of a BTA for a "long time," </p><p>adding that he "does not expect" an agreement to be reached </p><p>within 2003.  Hsieh noted that Lin\'s visit was in the </p><p>framework of Taiwan\'s "go south" policy regarding trade and </p><p>investment, and that Lin had made similar visits to Malaysia </p><p>and Thailand last November. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Vietnam\'s state-controlled broadcast or print </p><p>media did not report on Lin\'s visit, unlike similar visitors </p><p>from other, much less important partners.  According to Dr. </p><p>Sam, this is "typical" for Taiwan visits.  He suggested that </p><p>publicity over these types of visits "would antagonize" the </p><p>PRC. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>REACHING TOO FAR </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Dr. Sam recounted that last summer his Institute </p><p>had planned to host a conference on Taiwan\'s relations with </p><p>Southeast Asian countries.  When the PRC embassy heard about </p><p>it, officials there "reacted very strongly."  The PRC </p><p>embassy lodged an official complaint with the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs as well as with the National Center for </p><p>Social Sciences and Humanities, the parent institution of </p><p>the Institute of China Studies.  Senior officials from the </p><p>National Center "strongly urged" the Institute to cancel the </p><p>conference, which it did.  Dr. Sam suggested that, in </p><p>contrast to Lin\'s visit, which the PRC essentially viewed in </p><p>an economic context, the proposed conference apparently </p><p>stepped over the political line and was therefore </p><p>unacceptable to the PRC.  Dr. Sam said that the PRC embassy </p><p>had indicated, however, that Beijing would not object if the </p><p>conference took place in Taiwan.  Taiwan authorities </p><p>subsequently agreed to host in April 2003. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Vietnam continues to depend on good economic and </p><p>commercial ties with Taiwan, and is clearly willing to take </p><p>a little heat (apparently, increasingly pro forma) from the </p><p>PRC over at least economics-related senior level visits that </p><p>the PRC claims violate the "One China principle."     But </p><p>Vietnamese officials will be careful not to step over </p><p>perceived political lines that might truly anger the PRC, as </p><p>illustrated by last summer\'s ill-fated conference. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
