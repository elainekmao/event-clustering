<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 SANAA 000516 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, OPS FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, PREL, PTER, AADP, CASC, YM, EAC, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING MARCH 18;  UPDATE ON MARIB </p><p>INCIDENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 511 </p><p>     B. SANAA 398 </p><p>     C. SANAA 489 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Begin Summary:  The Ambassador convened an </p><p>Emergency Action Committee (EAC) meeting on March 18 to </p><p>assess threat information in light of the shooting incident </p><p>at the Hunt Oil facility in Marib (ref a) and the Iraq </p><p>contingency.  An uncorroborated source from an accounting </p><p>firm that works with Hunt and Nabors reported to RSO that the </p><p>shooter was a disgruntled employee who had been fired and who </p><p>was not supposed to be allowed on the oil complex.  EAC </p><p>members decided to go to the MoveSafe stance immediately as a </p><p>precaution, which means that employees must limit their </p><p>travel and move in armored vehicles from residence to Embassy </p><p>(ref b).  Key offices and personnel represented at the </p><p>meeting included: AMB, DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, </p><p>ORCA, OMC, SOC YEMEN, RMO, FPD, FBI and YALI (Yemen American </p><p>Language Institute).  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Update on Shootings in Marib </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ambassador spoke by telephone with Ray Hunt, Hunt </p><p>Oil President (in the U.S.), and assured him of the Embassy\'s </p><p>assistance with the disposition of the Amcit Ron Horsch\'s </p><p>body and the injured Canadian victim.  RMO spoke to the </p><p>director of the Yemen-German Hospital where the injured </p><p>Canadian is undergoing surgery at 1830 local time.  He was </p><p>shot twice in the area of the liver but progress is </p><p>reportedly positive.  RMO will remain in close contact with </p><p>hospital authorities to monitor his condition and offer </p><p>assistance as needed.  Hunt headquarters is contacting family </p><p>members of the victims.  CONS is coordinating closely with </p><p>Hunt to provide services as necessary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Post cannot yet determine the motive of the killer. </p><p>However, a source from an accounting firm co-located near </p><p>Hunt oil and Nabors in Marib reported to RSO that the killer, </p><p>Naji Ahmed al-Kumayn, was a disgruntled former employee, </p><p>recently fired, who was not supposed to be at the oil </p><p>complex.  This source reported differing information from </p><p>that received from Hunt regarding the weapon used in this </p><p>incident, stating that it was an AK-47 and not a pistol. </p><p>FBI, FPD (acting as a force multiplier for RSO) and security </p><p>personnel are traveling to Marib to assist in the </p><p>investigation.  Post expects further investigative details by </p><p>the morning of March 19.   (Comment:  Post urges caution in </p><p>reaching any conclusion on killer\'s motivation pending </p><p>results of investigation.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Post has received many calls from media outlets </p><p>asking for information.  A press statement was released after </p><p>clearance and answers to follow-up questions have been </p><p>prepared.  See paragraph 15 for text of press statement. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Iraq Contingency and Current Threat Information </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  Ambassador said that in light of President Bush\'s </p><p>speech, the change to StandFast would probably occur by </p><p>Thursday, March 20 unless circumstances warrant otherwise, </p><p>which will be discussed in another EAC meeting on March 19. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  ORCA briefed on current threat information.  Some </p><p>reporting was received corroborating the possibility of </p><p>random terrorist attacks unaffiliated to al-Qaeda or Iraqi </p><p>elements.  It was noted that such "lone wolf" terrorists, </p><p>acting alone or with small groups, could take advantage of </p><p>the Yemeni security forces possibly being stretched thin in </p><p>an Iraq contingency responding to increased demonstrations. </p><p>ORCA said that "lone wolf" terrorists do not have the time or </p><p>resources to plan attacks and would look for targets of </p><p>opportunity.  Changing routes and times and avoiding known </p><p>places where Americans congregate or popular intersections is </p><p>key to staying safe. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  In light of the Marib incident of an employee </p><p>being the killer, security at the Embassy regarding FSN </p><p>access was discussed.  FSNs are screened through metal </p><p>detectors both at the entrance gate and at Post One.  EAC </p><p>members were not aware of any FSNs who might be angry at the </p><p>Embassy.  The YALI Director stated that he would immediately </p><p>institute similar entry screening for YALI staff of all </p><p>nationalities. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>No Immediate Request for Authorized Departure </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Ambassador asked EAC members to consider seriously </p><p>whether Post should recommend a change to authorized </p><p>departure status.  There was no support for a move to </p><p>authorized departure at this time.  It was decided that the </p><p>EAC would discuss the matter further after more information </p><p>is known about the Marib incident.  EAC members discussed a </p><p>number of other factors, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- surveying all Amcit staff to again ascertain their opinion </p><p>and whether non-essential employees and family members would </p><p>plan to leave; </p><p> </p><p>-- determining what was meant by a comment made by the head </p><p>of airport security to FPD that if it was up to him he would </p><p>close the airport starting March 19; </p><p> </p><p>-- examining the likelihood of incidents like Marib and Jibla </p><p>happening in Sanaa to harder targets; </p><p> </p><p>-- continuing to examine tripwires; </p><p> </p><p>-- assessing reaction to the start of an Iraq war. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>MoveSafe Posture </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF)  After discussing the Marib incident, the Iraq </p><p>contingency and other threat information, EAC members decided </p><p>to go to a MoveSafe stance effective immediately after </p><p>weighing the pros and cons of such a move.  During MoveSafe, </p><p>employees are directed to minimize travel on the streets of </p><p>Sanaa and required to perform essential travel in armored </p><p>vehicles only (ref b).  Information on MoveSafe status was </p><p>disseminated by radio, telephone and by section heads to </p><p>those still at the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Warden Messages </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  RSO reported that the Ministry of Interior </p><p>recommended that Americans avoid Bab al-Yemen and other </p><p>tourist areas for the time being in light of the possible </p><p>war.  EAC decided to issue an immediate Warden Message </p><p>apprising Amcits of the Marib incident and including this </p><p>recommendation to avoid known areas where Americans </p><p>congregate. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Other Security Issues/Measures </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S)  The area where all vehicles undergo bomb checks in </p><p>front of the embassy was discussed as a possible easy target. </p><p> RSO will move vehicles to block sightlines to that area and </p><p>in the long term is looking into moving the sight off the </p><p>main road.  In addition, section heads were encouraged to </p><p>ensure that employees did alter their time of arrival to </p><p>avoid congestion and ensure they were changing times and </p><p>routes to a degree sufficient to frustrate any surveillance </p><p>attempt. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S)  RSO continued follow-up meetings regarding Sheraton </p><p>security to ensure proper coordination between the multiple </p><p>layers of security present at the hotel, including PSO, MOI, </p><p>hotel guards and group four (ref c). </p><p>12.  (C)  Embassy-affiliated Yemen-American Language School </p><p>(YALI) was discussed.  It was recommended that they screen </p><p>all employees.  As recommended to all Amcits, YALI plans to </p><p>lie low when the Iraq war begins and assess the situation </p><p>before returning to regular operations. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  The National Democratic Institute decided to move </p><p>their Amcit and Canadian trainers into Sanaa and move the </p><p>director to a hotel from her well-known house.  NDI is now </p><p>considering having all of its temporary expats leave Yemen in </p><p>light of the Marib incident. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  The March 15 demonstrations were discussed.  RSO </p><p>reported that the MOI gave him conflicting information from </p><p>that reported by the United Nations security director </p><p>regarding how the demonstration near the UN complex in Sanaa </p><p>was dispersed.  The UN representative reported that shots </p><p>were fired in the air by security forces after several unruly </p><p>youths attempted to climb a vehicle with a machine gun mount. </p><p> No injuries occurred.  The MOI reported, however, that shots </p><p>were fired in the air after stone throwers threatened to get </p><p>out of hand, and denied that anyone attempted to get onto a </p><p>military vehicle.  DAO said that a reliable source confirmed </p><p>press reports that demonstrations in Saada on the same day </p><p>got out of control and several people were killed. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  Text of Press Statement: </p><p> </p><p>The American Embassy has learned of the shooting of four </p><p>employees of Hunt Oil in Marib, Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>One American citizen, a Yemeni and a Canadian were killed; </p><p>another Canadian wounded. </p><p> </p><p>We condemn this violence and call on the Yemeni government to </p><p>investigate it fully. </p><p> </p><p>We cannot release further information pending notification of </p><p>family. </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy will assist in dealing with the injured and </p><p>deceased. </p><p> </p><p>American law enforcement personnel will assist the Yemeni </p><p>government in investigating this case. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
