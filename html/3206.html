<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 003461 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT/CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>NICOSIA FOR ILMG </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN MEDIA REACTION ON PRESIDENT\'S MIDDLE </p><p>EAST SPEECH, AMERICAN PRODUCTS BOYCOTT RALLY. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY.  NEWS REPORTS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT\'S MIDDLE </p><p>EAST SPEECH VARIED WIDELY IN THE JORDANIAN PRESS. </p><p>WHILE SEMI-OFFICIAL, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI </p><p>AND ITS SISTER NEWSPAPER CENTRIST, INFLUENTIAL AMONG </p><p>THE ELITE ENGLISH DAILY JORDAN TIMES PRAISED IT AS </p><p>BEING COMPATIBLE WITH JORDAN\'S VISION, THE CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR REPORTED </p><p>"INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM" AND LOCAL REJECTION OF THE </p><p>SPEECH.  THE INDEPENDENT, MASS-APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL- </p><p>ARAB AL-YAWM ONLY REPORTED BARE BONES COVERAGE OF THE </p><p>GOJ STATEMENT WELCOMING THE SPEECH.  EDITORIAL </p><p>COMMENTARIES ALSO REFLECTED CONTRASTING VIEWS ABOUT THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH, FROM COMMENTS LIKE "THE WAY </p><p>FORWARD" IN THE JORDAN TIMES AND "BUSH\'S VIEWS MEET THE </p><p>JORDANIAN VISION" IN AL-RAI, TO "BUSH ACTS AS </p><p>LIEUTENANT FOR SHARON" IN AL-DUSTOUR.  INDIVIDUAL </p><p>COMMENTATORS WERE LARGELY CRITICAL OF THE SPEECH. </p><p>DAILIES ALSO VARIED IN THEIR COVERAGE OF THE </p><p>CANCELLATION OF A RALLY FOR THE BOYCOTT OF AMERICAN </p><p>PRODUCTS ORGANIZED BY THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, </p><p>WHICH WAS PLANNED TO TAKE PLACE YESTERDAY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NEWS REPORTS: </p><p> </p><p>JORDANIAN DAILIES ON JUNE 26 WERE DOMINATED BY </p><p>REACTIONS TO PRESIDENT BUSH\'S SPEECH ON THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST.  THERE WAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN </p><p>THE TONE ADOPTED BY SEMI-OFFICIAL, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC </p><p>DAILY AL-RAI AND ITS SISTER NEWSPAPER CENTRIST, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL AMONG THE ELITE ENGLISH DAILY JORDAN TIMES </p><p>ON ONE HAND, AND THAT OF CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR AND INDEPENDENT, MASS-APPEAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM ON THE OTHER. </p><p> </p><p>AL-RAI AND THE JORDAN TIMES LED WITH THE HEADLINE: </p><p>"JORDAN WELCOMES BUSH\'S SPEECH AND CONSIDERS IT A </p><p>POSITIVE STEP TOWARDS CREATING A PALESTINIAN STATE."  A </p><p>SECOND FRONT-PAGE STORY IN BOTH NEWSPAPERS ANNOUNCED: </p><p>"BUSH\'S SPEECH WELCOMED IN THE ARAB WORLD AND </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY, BUT CAUSED DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN STREET."  THE LEAD STORY IN BOTH NEWSPAPERS </p><p>QUOTED THE STATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN, WHICH </p><p>SAID THAT: "THE SPEECH WAS COMPATIBLE WITH THE </p><p>JORDANIAN POSITION THAT CALLS FOR DEFINING THE OVERALL </p><p>FRAMEWORK FOR THE SOLUTION AND A TIME FRAME FOR </p><p>REVIVING THE PEACE PROCESS." </p><p> </p><p>AL-DUSTOUR, ON THE OTHER HAND, LED WITH THE HEADLINE: </p><p>"INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM OF BUSH\'S CALL FOR REPLACING </p><p>ARAFAT" ON TOP OF A PHOTO OF A MUTILATED BODY OF A </p><p>"MARTYR" KILLED IN HEBRON YESTERDAY.  IN A RARE MOVE BY </p><p>THE JORDANIAN MEDIA, AL-DUSTOUR RELEGATED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S STATEMENT TO A SECONDARY HEADLINE IN THE </p><p>THIRD STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE, WITH THE MAIN HEADLINE </p><p>OF THE STORY QUOTING THE FOREIGN MINISTER AS SAYING: </p><p>"BUSH\'S SPEECH GOES BEYOND ISRAEL\'S REQUEST FOR PHASED </p><p>SOLUTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>THE CANCELLATION OF THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS\' </p><p>RALLY FOR BOYCOTTING AMERICAN PRODUCTS, PLANNED FOR </p><p>YESTERDAY, WAS TREATED WITH EQUALLY DISSIMILAR </p><p>COVERAGE.  AL-RAI IGNORED THE EVENT COMPLETELY, AL- </p><p>DUSTOUR SAID IN A BRIEF REPORT THAT THE RALLY WAS </p><p>CANCELLED, AND AL-ARAB AL-YAWM REPORTED ON THE FRONT </p><p>PAGE THAT: "SECURITY AGENCIES PREVENTED THE </p><p>PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS FROM HOLDING THE RALLY FOR </p><p>THE BOYCOTT OF AMERICAN PRODUCTS." </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES: </p><p> </p><p>-- BUSH\'S IDEAS MEET WITH THE JORDANIAN VISION FOR A </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT. </p><p>THE LEADING COMMENTARY IN SEMI-OFFICIAL, INFLUENTIAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JUNE 26 SAID: "THE JORDANIAN </p><p>WELCOME OF THE SPEECH CAME IN REACTION TO THE U.S. </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE PLAYING A ROLE, </p><p>SOMETHING THAT HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH STRESSED ON </p><p>MORE THAN ONE OCCASION IN THE U.S.  THE PRESIDENT ALSO </p><p>AFFIRMED THE PALESTINIANS\' RIGHT TO AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>STATE IN WHICH THEY WOULD EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO SELF- </p><p>DETERMINATION.  ONE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER THAT JORDAN, </p><p>DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS, CALLED SETTING A TIME-FRAME </p><p>FOR ENDING THE OCCUPATION, AND HERE CAME THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH TO SET A THREE-YEAR DEADLINE FOR THE </p><p>END OF THE OCCUPATION, THEREBY CONFIRMING THE </p><p>CORRECTNESS OF JORDAN\'S VISION." </p><p> </p><p>-- BUSH\'S SPEECH, A STEP BACKWARDS </p><p>MOST WIDELY-READ DAILY COLUMNIST FAHED AL-FANEK WROTE </p><p>IN SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON </p><p>JUNE 26: "PRESIDENT BUSH DID NOT UTTER WORDS SUCH AS </p><p>`OCCUPATION,\' `WITHDRAWAL,\' `THE 1967 BORDERS,\' OR </p><p>`ISRAELI RAIDS ON PALESTINIAN TOWNS AND REFUGEE CAMPS.\' </p><p>HE CONCENTRATED ON PALESTINIAN TERRORISM WHOLE IGNORING </p><p>ISRAELI TERRORISM, AND HE CALLED FOR REPLACING THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT.  IN SHORT, PRESIDENT BUSH GAVE A </p><p>SPEECH IN WHICH HE WENT FURTHER THAN SHARON WOULD HAVE </p><p>HAD HE WRITTEN THE SPEECH HIMSELF.  AS FOR THE REFORMS </p><p>THAT BUSH DEMANDED, THEY ARE WORDS OF TRUTH INTENDED TO </p><p>COVER UP FOR MISCHIEF.  THE TRUE INTENTION BEHIND THEM </p><p>IS TO OBFUSCATE AND BUY TIME FOR SHARON TO COMPLETE HIS </p><p>MISSION." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE OCCUPATION GOVERNMENT WILL NOT RESPOND TO BUSH\'S </p><p>SPEECH. </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST MAHMOUD AL-RIMAWI WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JUNE 26: </p><p>"THE PRESIDENT CALLED ON THE OCCUPATION GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>WITHDRAW TO ITS POSITIONS BEFORE SEPTEMBER 28, 2000. </p><p>SHARON\'S GOVERNMENT WILL NOT DO SO.  INSTEAD, IT WILL </p><p>CONTINUE DESTROYING WHAT REMAINS OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE PRESIDENT ALSO ASKED FOR A STOP TO </p><p>SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY.  SHARON\'S GOVERNMENT WILL NOT </p><p>ACCEPT TO DO SO EITHER.  THE FEAR IS THAT THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION WILL RESPOND TO THIS ISRAELI DISDAIN BY </p><p>LAUNCHING ANOTHER ATTACK AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>AUTHORITY.  THIS IS HOW IT HAS RESPONDED DURING THE </p><p>PAST YEAR." </p><p> </p><p>-- BUSH ACTS AS SHARON\'S LIEUTENANT. </p><p>THE LEADING COMMENTARY OF CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON JUNE 26 SAID: "PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH\'S SPEECH WAS NOT SURPRISING EXCEPT IN THE DEGREE </p><p>OF ITS BIAS FOR ISRAEL, THE FLAGRANCE OF ITS ENMITY TO </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, AND ITS TOTAL DISMISSAL OF </p><p>ARAB DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.  THIS HAS DASHED ALL THE HOPES </p><p>THAT WERE PINNED ON THE U.S. HAVING A RESIDUE OF </p><p>JUSTICE AND INTEGRITY.  THIS SPEECH WILL ONLY </p><p>CONSOLIDATE SHARON\'S BELLIGERENCE, PROLONG THE </p><p>OCCUPATION, AND UNLEASH ANOTHER WAVE OF ZIONIST </p><p>EXTREMISM, WHICH WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE MET WITH PARALLEL </p><p>PALESTINIAN REACTIONS.  BY CONSEQUENCE, BUSH\'S SPEECH </p><p>WILL ONLY HAVE USHERED IN MORE BLOODSHED, DESTRUCTION, </p><p>AND DEATH." </p><p> </p><p>-- CHANCES OF IMPLEMENTING BUSH\'S IDEAS. </p><p>TAHER AL-ADWAN, CHIEF EDITOR OF INDEPENDENT, MASS- </p><p>APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM WROTE ON JUNE 26: </p><p>"I EXPECT THAT MOST ARAB STATES WILL ACCEPT BUSH\'S </p><p>IDEAS, WHETHER PUBLICLY OR IN SECRET, NOT BECAUSE THEY </p><p>AGREE WITH ANYTHING IN THEM, BUT OUT OF FEAR OF A </p><p>CONFRONTATION WITH WASHINGTON.  IN REALITY, BUSH\'S </p><p>IDEAS MEET WITH SHARON\'S STRATEGY IN A VITAL POINT, </p><p>THAT OF CHANGING THE PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP AND ALL </p><p>PALESTINIAN INSTITUTIONS.  THIS AGREES WITH SHARON\'S </p><p>STRATEGY TO WITHDRAW ISRAEL\'S RECOGNITION OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP, WHICH CAME AFTER THE OSLO </p><p>ACCORD.  IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT GAVE SHARON </p><p>ADDITIONAL TIME TO CONTINUE HIS WAR AGAINST THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  AS FOR PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATIONS, </p><p>BUSH\'S DISMISSAL OF THEM WILL ONLY PUSH THEM TO FURTHER </p><p>RESISTANCE AND DAILY MARTYRDOM OPERATIONS, EVEN IF </p><p>ARAFAT CALLS ON THEM EVERY DAY TO STOP."
