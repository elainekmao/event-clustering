<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004003 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: KURDISH YEZIDIS SPEAK UP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason:1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Among Turkey\'s estimated 12-15 million Kurds exists a </p><p>minority within a minority -- the Yezidis.  According to </p><p>Veysi Bulut, a leader of the Yezidi community in Turkey: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Yezidism (note: a non-Islamic religion derived from </p><p>Zoroastrianism.  End note) was once the dominant form of </p><p>worship among the Kurds.  Yezidis vigorously dispute the </p><p>slander, widespread among certain Islamic elements, that they </p><p>are "devil worshippers."  As monotheists, the Yezidis "were </p><p>the first to believe in one God;" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- All Yezidis speak the Kurmanji dialect of Kurdish that </p><p>predominates among Kurds in Turkey.  Indeed, "all Yezidis are </p><p>Kurds, and all Kurds originally were Yezidis."  Many were (he </p><p>charged) forcibly converted to Islam or killed in religious </p><p>intercommunal fighting with Muslims down through the </p><p>centuries.  There is still considerable animosity between </p><p>Muslims and Yezidis in Turkey; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On the other hand, Yezidis "get along well" with Turkey\'s </p><p>heterodox (Shia) Alevi community -- especially with Kurdish </p><p>Alevis, with whom the Yezidi share rituals including praying </p><p>at sunrise and sunset.  Yezidis "also see Christians as </p><p>brothers;" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Politically, Yezidis support the secular State, and oppose </p><p>Islamic extremism; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- There are 200 Yezidi villages in Kurdish southeastern </p><p>Turkey, with a population of about five thousand.  There are </p><p>over 800 thousand Yezidis across the border in Iraq, home to </p><p>the most important Yezidi religious sites. (Note: these </p><p>population figures were confirmed to us by Suavi Aydin, </p><p>Professor of Archaeology at Hacettepe University and an </p><p>expert on minorities in Turkey.  End note.)  Some 100 </p><p>thousand Yezidis live in Iran, 800 thousand in Georgia, and </p><p>30 thousand in Syria; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- During the Turkish State\'s recent struggle with the PKK </p><p>(a.k.a. KADEK), many Yezidis fled to Germany, Sweden, Canada, </p><p>and even the U.S.  However, some expat Yezidis want to take </p><p>advantage of the improved situation in southeastern Turkey to </p><p>return to their homes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Comment: Kurdish Microethnicity </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) For historical reasons, Yezidis have long sought to </p><p>deflect attention from themselves.  But, like other elements </p><p>of what is generally regarded as the wider Kurdish minority </p><p>in Turkey -- including not only Kurdish Alevis but the more </p><p>obscure ethnic Zaza subgroup -- we expect Yezidis to become </p><p>more visible as the EU political reform program takes root. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
