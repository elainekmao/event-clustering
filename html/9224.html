<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001372 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The June 29 edition of the government-controlled </p><p>      weekly "The Sunday Mail" devoted considerable space to </p><p>      articles talking about the forth-coming historic visit to </p><p>      Africa by United States President George W. Bush and </p><p>      Secretary of State Colin Powell\'s op-ed in the New York </p><p>      Times on Zimbabwe.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Bush in no position to talk democracy, </p><p>      says top U. S. writer" the paper carried the following </p><p>      article (adapted from Michael Moore\'s latest book entitled </p><p>      `Stupid White Men\') by Munyaradzi Huni, Political Editor, </p><p>      on page one: </p><p> </p><p>      "United States President Mr. George W. Bush is a </p><p>      threat to American national security and a `Thief-in- </p><p>      Chief\' who should not lecture the world about </p><p>      democracy and human rights, says a leading American </p><p>      writer, Mr. Michael Moore.  He says there is nothing </p><p>      sadder than seeing other leaders of the world trying </p><p>      to `mimic the leaders of our country,\' as their main </p><p>      preoccupation is to exploit the poor countries.  On </p><p>      the other hand, political commentators and diplomats </p><p>      from Southern Africa have warned Mr. Bush that he </p><p>      will be met with a baptism of fire during his visit </p><p>      to Africa next week if he tries to lecture to `us </p><p>      things like democracy and human rights that he is </p><p>      wantonly violating in his country. . . .\'" </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Two great liars of our time" the same </p><p>      paper carried another article (based in part on Moore\'s </p><p>      book) on page 9 by Munyaradzi Huni: </p><p> </p><p>      "One of America\'s most respected writers, Michael </p><p>      Moore, in his latest book entitled `Stupid White </p><p>      Men" that is selling like hot cakes all over the </p><p>      world, describes U. S. President George W. Bush as </p><p>      `a drunk, a thief, a possible felon, an unconvicted </p><p>      deserter and a crybaby.\'  If Moore had gone a step </p><p>      further to tell the world that Mr. Bush is also a </p><p>      bully and an unrepentant liar, then he would have </p><p>      become the first person to give the correct </p><p>      description of the U. S. leader.  But still his </p><p>      description ranks among the best so far. . .Mr. Bush </p><p>      and Mr. (Tony) Blair have manufactured lots of lies </p><p>      against Zimbabwe and it\'s now like an obsession as </p><p>      they dream about regime change in the country, but </p><p>      just like all lies, they will work only for a short </p><p>      time. . .Like typical bullies, Mr. Bush and Mr. </p><p>      Blair\'s lies are all about trying to promote and </p><p>      protect U. S. and UK interests at all costs and </p><p>      using whatever means necessary.  No wonder why they </p><p>      ignored the U. N. as they invaded Iraq. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "an overwhelmed house Negro" the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail\' </p><p>      (06/29) carried the following propaganda articles </p><p>      under the scornful phantom chitchat column  "Under </p><p>      the Surface": </p><p> </p><p>      "An overwhelmed House Negro": "U. S. Secretary of </p><p>      State Colin Powell is really behaving like an over- </p><p>      fed House Negro as many have always thought he is. </p><p>      He is one hell of an unashamed sell-out - a true </p><p>      Uncle Tom who has been overwhelmed by events.  Last </p><p>      week he decided to show his boss, George W. Bush, </p><p>      how good he is in following instructions, even </p><p>      stupid ones, when he wrote a shameful article in the </p><p>      New York Times attacking the Zimbabwean </p><p>      government. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>      "The victory that never was": ". . .America and </p><p>      Britain thought Saddam (Hussein) was one big </p><p>      fool. . .But news from Iraq will tell you that </p><p>      Saddam is no fool at all.  Like a true war </p><p>      strategist, Saddam retreated after realizing that </p><p>      America and Britain were coming with `weapons of </p><p>      mass destruction.\'  He let their soldiers take over </p><p>      Baghdad and, like true fools, Bush and Blair </p><p>      celebrated.  To them the war was over.  But not for </p><p>      Saddam.  The war was just starting.  Now American </p><p>      and British soldiers in Iraq are under siege.  They </p><p>      are dying on a daily basis.  We are not celebrating </p><p>      death here, but then Bush and Blair were celebrating </p><p>      as they massacred thousands of innocent Iraqis, </p><p>      including journalists they had accredited to cover </p><p>      the war as if it was some football match. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>      "Winner of the Week: George W. Bush:" "U. S. </p><p>      President W. George W. Bush is really taking things </p><p>      too far. . .How can Bush try to preach democracy, </p><p>      human rights, good governance and the rule of law </p><p>      when we all know that he is the first culprit to </p><p>      break all these concepts?  Just look at what he has </p><p>      done in Afghanistan and Iraq and just look at how </p><p>      bad his government is treating Arabs.  Even for </p><p>      South African leader Nelson Mandela has had enough </p><p>      of Bush\'s nonsense and he has refused to meet the U. </p><p>      S. leader on his first visit to Africa.  The bully </p><p>      is getting thick-headed with every passing day, but </p><p>      the good thing is that the more his head gets bigger </p><p>      and thicker, the more enemies he is creating for </p><p>      himself and all American citizens.  Who else would </p><p>      take Under the Surface\'s award this week?" </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
