<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001652 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS AND INL, NEW DELHI FOR DEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-06-2002 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PGOV, PTER, CE, MV </p><p>SUBJECT:  Counternarcotics update:  Heroin shipments on </p><p>the downswing; GSL to provide assistance to the Maldives </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Chennai 710 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 1082 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  This Counternarcotics update reviews: </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) reports that </p><p>heroin shipments to Sri Lanka have been dramatically </p><p>reduced of late.  The PNB attributes this positive trend </p><p>to three factors:  (1) The recent success of Indian </p><p>authorities in interdiction; (2) indications that the </p><p>Tamil Tigers may be acting to prevent such shipments; </p><p>and (3) increased cooperation between the PNB and other </p><p>police bureaus.  In other news indicative of an </p><p>increased focus on regional approaches on how to deal </p><p>with the drug problem, the GSL has announced that it is </p><p>providing the Maldivian government drug interdiction </p><p>training.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Decline in Heroin Shipments </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2.  (SBU) The first item in this Counternarcotics update </p><p>involves reports that heroin shipments to Sri Lanka are </p><p>on the downswing.  Elaborating on this positive news, </p><p>the Director of the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) Senior </p><p>Superintendent Pujith Jayasundara told us that the PNB </p><p>has evidence that heroin shipments into Sri Lanka have </p><p>been dramatically reduced in the past few months.  He </p><p>sited a number of reasons for the decline, including the </p><p>recent success of Indian authorities in interdiction. </p><p>Recent seizures by Indian authorities have included that </p><p>of 27KG and 32KG heroin shipments -- see Ref A.  Based </p><p>on this record of seizures, the PNB believes that Indian </p><p>police are taking drug trafficking using Sri Lanka as a </p><p>nexus with increased seriousness. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Another apparent factor in the downswing in </p><p>heroin shipments is the reported crackdown by the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on drug </p><p>trafficking.  Jayasundara told us that the PNB is </p><p>receiving credible information that the LTTE is </p><p>intercepting narcotics traffickers and incarcerating </p><p>them.  This information contradicted previous reports </p><p>that the LTTE gained some of its income via narcotics </p><p>smuggling, he noted.  Jayasundara added that press </p><p>reports stating that the LTTE recently seized 40KG of </p><p>heroin could not be confirmed, but there were </p><p>indications that the reports were accurate. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Commenting on another possible factor in the </p><p>downswing, Jayasundara was very complimentary of what </p><p>appeared to an increase in cooperation by local police </p><p>offices in hampering narcotic sales.  Although there had </p><p>not been large seizures of narcotics in the operations </p><p>carried out with local offices of late, he noted that a </p><p>large number of dealers have been arrested and remain in </p><p>custody thanks to increased GSL coordination.  Those in </p><p>custody included some suspected of being major suppliers </p><p>of narcotics.  The PNB also believes that it is becoming </p><p>increasingly difficult for traffickers to travel to Sri </p><p>Lanka by sea because the navy is now able to focus more </p><p>on such activities than in the recent past because of </p><p>the ceasefire with the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>Program with Maldives </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) In other news, the PNB has announced an </p><p>upcoming training program with the Maldives meant to </p><p>assist narcotics interdiction at the international </p><p>airport serving the Maldivian capital city, Male.  On </p><p>September 23, the PNB will begin training 12 Maldivian </p><p>officers to do narcotics screening at the Male </p><p>International Airport.  As part of the program, the PNB </p><p>will also be providing training using sniffer dogs.  The </p><p>GSL will provide two dogs for the Maldivians to use at </p><p>the end of the training. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (C) The news concerning heroin shipments is certainly </p><p>positive.  During the last two months, the PNB has </p><p>appeared to be very active, with regular reports of </p><p>arrests and seizures.  Despite the overall seizure rate </p><p>being down from this year compared to last year (from </p><p>January through July 61KG of heroin have been seized in </p><p>2002 compared to 102KG in 2001), all indications are </p><p>that heroin supplies in Sri Lanka have been dramatically </p><p>reduced.  The PNB believes the same holds true for </p><p>narcotics being transshipped through Sri Lanka, which is </p><p>also good news, as is the apparent crackdown by the </p><p>LTTE.  Finally, the fact that Sri Lanka and the Maldives </p><p>are cooperating on counternarcotics training is a </p><p>constructive development, indicative of an increased </p><p>focus on regional approaches on how to deal with the </p><p>drug problem.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
