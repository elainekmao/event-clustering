SARAY (VAN) TORTURE VICTIM RE-ARRESTED </p><p>(Evrensel)  Saray (Van) torture victim Okan Yurdabak </p><p>was re-arrested on November 17 after he had filed suit </p><p>against torturers.  Yurdabak claimed the local </p><p>Jandarma commander insulted and threatened him for </p><p>filing suit.  Later the same day, Yurdabak was </p><p>released.  He earlier claimed that Saray Jandarma </p><p>officials had raped him with a truncheon while in </p><p>custody after being arrested following a fight over a </p><p>land dispute.  He reportedly applied to the Van Human </p><p>Rights Association (HRA) for assistance as he was </p><p>afraid he might "disappear" while in custody. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.

The closure stemmed from </p><p>the association\'s "disrupting general security and </p><p>public order, and causing acts of violence to </p><p>increase." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  CONTINUED PRO-OCALAN PROTESTS </p><p>(Evrensel)  Hundreds of youths staged demonstrations </p><p>in six Batman districts to protest implementation of </p><p>isolation policies against PKK (KADEK) leader Abdullah </p><p>Ocalan.
