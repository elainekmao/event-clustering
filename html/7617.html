SUMMARY. THE DIRECTORS GENERAL OF THE WORLD HEALTH </p><p>ORGANIZATION (WHO) AND THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>ORGANIZATION (FAO) PRESIDED OVER THE 4/23 RELEASE OF THE </p><p>WHO/FAO EXPERT CONSULTATION REPORT ON DIET, NUTRITION AND </p><p>PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. BOTH DIRECTORS </p><p>GENERAL EMPHASIZED THAT THE REPORT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING </p><p>OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GLOBAL STRATEGY AND EXPRESSED </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN THE REPORT\'S SOUND SCIENTIFIC BASIS. FAO </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL DIOUF STATED THAT THE FAO GOVERNING </p><p>BODIES WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE REPORT AS </p><p>SOON AS POSSIBLE.  CONCERNING THE CONTROVERSIAL SUGAR </p><p>RECOMMENDATION, DIOUF SAID THAT THE ISSUE "HAD BEEN TAKEN </p><p>OUT OF CONTEXT" AND NOTED THAT THE RECOMMENDATION WAS NOT </p><p>A "STANDARD TO BE REGULATED."  IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION </p><p>FROM THE PRESS, WHO DIRECTOR GENERAL BRUNTLAND SAID THAT </p><p>SHE HADN\'T SEEN SUCH A "STRONG AND MISDIRECTED" RESPONSE </p><p>(FROM THE SUGAR INDUSTRY) SINCE THE "TOBACCO INDUSTRY WAS </p><p>ON THE MOVE."  AMBASSADOR TONY HALL\'S PRESS RELEASE, </p><p>ISSUED THE SAME DAY, EXPRESSED U.S. COMMITMENT TO </p><p>ADDRESSING THE GLOBAL NEED FOR IMPROVED DIETS AND </p><p>INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO FIGHT PREVENTABLE CHRONIC </p><p>DISEASES, BUT STATED THAT THE WHO/FAO REPORT FELL SHORT </p><p>OF PRESENTING THE COMPREHENSIVE BODY OF EVIDENCE AND </p><p>RIGOROUS CONCLUSIONS NECESSARY TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR </p><p>WHO AND FAO POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE DIRECTORS GENERAL OF WHO AND FAO PRESIDED OVER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01728  01 OF 03  231431Z </p><p>THE 4/23 RELEASE OF THE WHO/FAO EXPERT REPORT ON DIET, </p><p>NUTRITION AND PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AT FAO </p><p>HEADQUARTERS IN ROME.  MS. SHIRIKI KUMANYIKA, VICE-CHAIR </p><p>OF THE EXPERT CONSULTATION, PROVIDED A SHORT OVERVIEW OF </p><p>THE REPORT.  SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE OF FAO STAFFERS, </p><p>PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES AND THE MEDIA, WHO DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL (DG) BRUNTLAND STATED THAT CHRONIC DISEASES </p><p>CAUSED 40 MILLION PREMATURE DEATHS PER YEAR AND THAT </p><p>DISEASES SUCH AS OBESITY AND DIABETES WERE NO LONGER A </p><p>"RICH COUNTRY PROBLEM."  THE EXPERT REPORT ON DIET, </p><p>NUTRITION AND PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES CONTAINED </p><p>THE "BEST CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE" AND WILL SERVE AS </p><p>THE "SCIENCE-BASED FOUNDATION" FOR THE GLOBAL STRATEGY </p><p>STILL TO BE DEVELOPED.  SHE NOTED THAT MANY OF THE </p><p>CONCLUSIONS -- THAT A HEALTHY DIET WAS ONE LOW IN SUGAR, </p><p>SALT AND SATURATED FATS, AND HIGH IN FRUITS AND </p><p>VEGETABLES -- WERE NOT NEW BUT HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIATED BY </p><p>MORE RECENT RESEARCH.  BRUNTLAND DETAILED NEXT STEPS FOR </p><p>THE FORMULATION OF THE GLOBAL STRATEGY, INCLUDING MEETING </p><p>WITH STAKEHOLDERS (INDUSTRY, NGO\'S) IN PREPARATION FOR A </p><p>STRATEGY TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE WHO EXECUTIVE BOARD IN </p><p>2004. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CONCERNING MEMBER REACTIONS TO THE REPORT, SHE </p><p>REPORTED THAT A RECENT EUROPEAN REGION MEETING HAD </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY TOOLS SHOULD BE </p><p>USED (TO IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGY) AND HAD NOTED THE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR ADVERTISING, MARKETING, TRADE AND FISCAL </p><p>POLICIES.  THE EUROPEAN MEETING HAD ALSO CONCLUDED </p><p>(ACCORDING TO BRUNTLAND), THAT TRADE AGREEMENTS AND </p><p>DECISIONS ON AGRICULTURE SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN TERMS OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01728  01 OF 03  231431Z </p><p>THEIR IMPACT ON HEALTH.  BRUNTLAND CONCLUDED THAT SHIFTS </p><p>IN DIET AND EXERCISE COULD LEAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON </p><p>HEALTH AND THAT THE EXPERT REPORT CONSTITUTED A "MAJOR </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO THIS EFFORT." </p><p> </p><p>4.  FAO DG JACQUES DIOUF CALLED THE REPORT "TIMELY" AND </p><p>"SIGNIFICANT" AND A MANIFESTATION OF THE LONG </p><p>COLLABORATION BETWEEN FAO AND WHO IN THE "GENERATION OF </p><p>SCIENCE-BASED ADVICE."  HE DISCUSSED THE PROCESS OF </p><p>CONVENING THE SCIENTISTS AND SPECIALISTS TO PREPARE THE </p><p>EXPERT REPORT, EMPHASIZING THEIR "INDEPENDENCE" AND </p><p>"SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE."  HE ALSO STATED THAT THE PROCESS </p><p>WAS TRANSPARENT AND INVOLVED STAKEHOLDERS. IN THIS </p><p>CONTEXT HE SAID THAT SOME RECOMMENDATIONS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>SUGAR RECOMMENDATION, HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.  IT </p><p>WAS NOT MEANT TO BE A "PRECISE SCIENTIFIC" AMOUNT, BUT </p><p>THE "BEST COMPROMISE BASED ON CURRENT KNOWLEDGE WHICH WAS </p><p>DESIRABLE FOR A POPULATION AT LARGE", AND WAS NOT A </p><p>"STANDARD TO BE REGULATED."  HE NOTED THAT MORE RESEARCH </p><p>NEEDED TO BE DONE, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES </p><p>WHERE ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE FOODS MAY BE LIMITED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DIOUF EMPHASIZED THAT THE REPORT WAS "THE BEGINNING," </p><p>NOT THE END OF THE PROCESS. THE REPORT AND THE FAO </p><p>RESPONSE WILL BE PRESENTED TO FAO\'S GOVERNING BODIES AS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3903 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01728  02 OF 03  231431Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     UTED-00  FDRE-01  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PER-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------59F82B  231432Z /38 </p><p>R 231427Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9381 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2636 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY MEXICO </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 001728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO HHS FOR VALDEZ AND STEIGER </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA WINNICK AND KOTOK, IO/T FOR BLACKWOOD </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR REICH AND HUGHES </p><p>MEXICO CITY FOR BRAKEL </p><p>GENEVA FOR HOHMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01728  02 OF 03  231431Z </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, FAO, EAGR, ETRD </p><p>SUBJECT:  FAO/WHO RELEASE OF EXPERT REPORT ON DIET, </p><p>NUTRITION AND PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES </p><p> </p><p>SOON AS POSSIBLE.  FAO\'S RESPONSE WILL INCLUDE AN </p><p>ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT ON CONSUMERS AND FARMERS IN </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  IT WILL LOOK AT HOW FOOD AND </p><p>AGRICULTURAL SECTORS WILL ADJUST AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR </p><p>PRODUCTS, PROCESSING AND TRADE.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>RECOMMENDATION ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND FISH HAD </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR FAO\'S WORK ON HORTICULTURE AND </p><p>FISHERIES, AND "PRESENTED OPPORTUNITIES" FOR DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES WHICH MAY HAVE A "COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE" IN </p><p>PRODUCING THESE FOODS. </p><p> </p><p>MEDIA QUESTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE REUTERS CORRESPONDENT ASKED FOR COMMENT ON THE </p><p>SUGAR INDUSTRY ALLEGATION THAT THE REPORT WOULD CAUSE </p><p>PEOPLE TO THINK "THERE IS A HEALTH RISK TO CONSUMING MORE </p><p>THAN 10 PERCENT SUGAR" AND THEIR REQUEST TO HAVE THE </p><p>REPORT "REMOVED FROM THE WHO WEBSITE."  MS. SHIRIKI </p><p>KUMANYIKA, VICE-CHAIR OF THE EXPERT CONSULTATION, CALLED </p><p>THIS REACTION "UNFORTUNATE," NOTING THAT THE SUGAR </p><p>RECOMMENDATION IS A TARGET FOR A POPULATION AT LARGE, AND </p><p>THAT THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT HAD NOT CHANGED SINCE THE </p><p>WHO\'S LAST REPORT (1990) ON THE SUBJECT.  SHE SAID THAT </p><p>THE EVIDENCE BETWEEN OBESITY AND DENTAL CARIES AND SUGAR </p><p>WAS "EXTREMELY WELL ESTABLISHED" AND THAT THE EXPERTS HAD </p><p>NOT "MISCONSTRUED THE EVIDENCE." </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01728  02 OF 03  231431Z </p><p>7.  WHO DG BRUNTLAND RESPONDED THAT THE "SOLIDITY OF THE </p><p>WORK IS WELL-FOUNDED WHICH MAKES THOSE "CRITICISMS </p><p>UNREASONABLE."  SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD NOT SEEN SUCH A </p><p>"STRONG AND MISDIRECTED" MISSIVES (FROM THE SUGAR </p><p>INDUSTRY) SINCE THE DAYS WHEN "THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY WAS </p><p>ON THE MOVE." </p><p> </p><p>8.  A JAPANESE CORRESPONDENT QUERIED HOW THE "COOPERATION </p><p>OF THE FAST-FOOD INDUSTRIES" WOULD BE OBTAINED.  FAO DG </p><p>DIOUF RESPONDED, "SOME PEOPLE OVERUSE FAST FOOD AND THIS </p><p>HAS LED TO OBESITY, BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE COMPOSITION OF </p><p>THE FOOD AND THE OVERALL FOOD INTAKE.  DG WHO DG </p><p>BRUNTLAND STATED THAT "FAST FOOD ONCE A MONTH, OR A WEEK </p><p>WAS OK, BUT AS A DAILY ROUTINE IT WILL RESULT IN </p><p>NUTRITIONAL STATUS GOING DOWN AND BODY WEIGHT GOING UP." </p><p>SHE ADDED THAT DRINKING "SUGARY DRINKS" MADE THE </p><p>SITUATION "EVEN WORSE." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENTS FROM FAO PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES OF ZIMBABWE, SPEAKING </p><p>FOR THE AFRICAN GROUP, WELCOMED THE PROGRESSIVE DEEPENING </p><p>OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE SUBJECT, BUT EMPHASIZED MEMBER STATE </p><p>INTEREST IN "SHAPING THE AGRICULTURAL COMPONENT, </p><p>PARTICULARLY HOW AND WHEN TO SHIFT PRODUCTION." SHE </p><p>RECALLED THAT MEMBER STATES STILL NEEDED TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>REPORT; THEY HAD A PROBLEM "HAVING THE REPORT ATTRIBUTED </p><p>TO US" BEFORE IT HAD BEEN SEEN BY THE FAO\'S POLICY MAKING </p><p>BODIES.  FAO DG DIOUF RESPONDED THAT FAO MEMBERS WOULD BE </p><p>FULLY INVOLVED AND MENTIONED THAT THE REPORT WOULD BE </p><p>PRESENTED TO THE FAO COUNCIL.  HE ALSO NOTED THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01728  02 OF 03  231431Z </p><p>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN "FAO EXPERT REPORT" AND AN "FAO </p><p>STRATEGY" (THE LATTER BEING MEMBER-OWNED, THE FORMER </p><p>REPRESENTING THE VIEWS OF THE EXPERTS). </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE AMBASSADOR OF BRAZIL ASKED WHETHER THE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS WERE TO BECOME "STANDARDS" OR "GOALS." HE </p><p>NOTED IN THIS CONTEXT THAT THE INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF </p><p>THE REPORT (PRESENTED BY VICE-CHAIR KUMANYIKA) HAD </p><p>REFERRED TO THE ROLE OF CODEX ALIMENTARIUS.  HE ASKED FOR </p><p>ASSURANCES THAT "STRATEGIES" ADOPTED BY GOVERNMENTS NOT </p><p>BECOME BARRIERS TO FREE TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. </p><p>DG DIOUF RESPONDED THAT CODEX WAS AN "INTERGOVERNMENTAL </p><p>BODY," THAT ANY STRATEGY WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED BY </p><p>MEMBERS IN THE GOVERNING BODIES AND "GO THROUGH THE </p><p>NORMAL PROCESS."  (DIOUF DID NOT DIRECTLY ANSWER THE </p><p>QUESTION ON TRADE BARRIERS.) </p><p> </p><p>U.S. PRESS RELEASE </p><p> </p><p>11.  AMBASSADOR HALL RELEASED A PRESS RELEASE ON 4/23, </p><p>STATING THAT THE REPORT "FALLS SHORT OF PRESENTING THE </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE BODY OF EVIDENCE AND RIGOROUS CONCLUSIONS </p><p>NECESSARY TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR WHO AND FAO POLICY </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS" AND WELCOMING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FAO </p><p>MEMBERS TO DISCUSS THE REPORT IN DEPTH.

BEGIN TEXT OF PRESS RELEASE: </p><p> </p><p>THE BEST POSSIBLE SCIENTIFIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH EVIDENCE </p><p>SHOULD BE THE CORNERSTONE OF THE 2004 GLOBAL STRATEGY ON </p><p>DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH.  I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THE WHO/FAO REPORT FALLS SHORT OF PRESENTING THE </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE BODY OF EVIDENCE AND RIGOROUS CONCLUSIONS </p><p>NECESSARY TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR WHO AND FAO POLICY </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THIS REPORT HAS NEVER EVEN BEEN AN ITEM </p><p>FOR DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF FAO.  THIS </p><p>IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE AROUND THE WORLD.  THE </p><p>CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE </p><p>DEVELOPING WORLD SERVE TO REMIND US OF THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>GETTING THE SCIENCE RIGHT.  THE CONSEQUENCES OF DIET AND </p><p>NUTRITION ADVICE - AND THIS REPORT - EXTEND WELL BEYOND </p><p>PUBLIC HEALTH TO THE VERY ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF THE </p><p>FARMERS WHO PRODUCE THE FOODS WE EAT.  WE WELCOME THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS IN DEPTH AT THE NEXT FAO </p><p>COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01728  03 OF 03  231432Z </p><p>SOUND SCIENCE CAN HELP GOVERNMENTS EFFECTIVELY PROMOTE </p><p>PUBLIC HEALTH.  A TRANSPARENT AND PARTICIPATORY </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAT INCORPORATES A RANGE OF </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS CAN HELP TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE </p><p>SOLUTIONS AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES. </p><p> </p><p>GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING DIET, </p><p>NUTRITION AND THE PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES, WE </p><p>BELIEVE EXPERT PEERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING </p><p>THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH COMMUNITY, INDUSTRY, NON- </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND PROFESSIONAL HEALTH </p><p>SOCIETIES, WOULD STRENGTHEN THE REPORT\'S FINDINGS WITH </p><p>ONGOING DEBATE.  SUCH DISCUSSION WOULD ALSO PROVIDE </p><p>VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AS THE WHO, FAO, AND MEMBER </p><p>GOVERNMENTS MOVE FORWARD IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GLOBAL </p><p>STRATEGY ON DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH TO BE </p><p>CONSIDERED IN 2004. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES IS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE GLOBAL </p><p>NEED FOR IMPROVED DIETS AND INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY </p><p>TO FIGHT PREVENTABLE CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS DIABETES, </p><p>HEART DISEASE, AND CERTAIN CANCERS.
