<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 001046 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); EUR/OHI, NEA/IAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KNAR, PHUM, KNAR, VT, VTPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLOCAUST MUSEUM DELEGATION WORKS IN SECRET </p><p>ARCHIVES, OFFERS COLLABORATION TO CATALOGUE CLOSED RECORDS </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: A DELEGATION FROM THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM MET WITH </p><p>VATICAN ARCHIVE/LIBRARY DIRECTOR CARDINAL JORJE MARIA MEJIA </p><p>MARCH 3 AND GAINED ACCESS TO THE VATICAN SECRET ARCHIVE TO </p><p>SURVEY CERTAIN PRE-WAR RECORDS.  THE DELEGATION PROPOSED TO </p><p>MEJIA COLLABORATION WITH THE ARCHIVE\'S SMALL STAFF TO </p><p>CATALOGUE AND MICROFICHE OTHER WWII ERA RECORDS THAT HAVE </p><p>NOT YET BEEN RELEASED.  CARDINAL MEJIA WELCOMED THE </p><p>PROPOSAL, AND URGED THE U.S. DELEGATION TO PUT ITS PROPOSAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01046  01 OF 02  131459Z </p><p>FOR COLLABORATION IN WRITING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, SO THAT </p><p>HE COULD SHARE IT WITH THE VATICAN MFA.  WE BELIEVE THE </p><p>HOLY SEE WILL DECIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OFFER TO </p><p>CATALOGUE, WHICH WOULD ACCELERATE THE RELEASE OF PIUS XI </p><p>ERA DOCUMENTS AND ENHANCE SCHOLARSHIP ON THE VATICAN\'S ROLE </p><p>DURING THE WW II ERA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AMBASSADOR ACCOMPANIED A DELEGATION FROM THE WASHINGTON </p><p>D.C. HOLOCAUST MUSEUM TO A MARCH 3 DISCUSSION OF ACCESS BY </p><p>HOLOCAUST MUSEUM PERSONNEL TO THE VATICAN SECRET ARCHIVES </p><p>WITH ARCHIVE DIRECTOR CARDINAL JORJE MARIA MEJIA. </p><p>HOLOCAUST MUSEUM SCHOLARSHIP DIRECTOR PAUL SHAPIRO, </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM\'S INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES PROJECT, </p><p>RADU IOANID, AND WESTERN EUROPE PROJECT DIRECTOR, KLAUS </p><p>MULLER TOLD MEJIA THAT THE MUSEUM ARCHIVISTS SOUGHT ACCESS </p><p>TO NEWLY OPENED RECORDS FROM THE PRE-WWII PIUS XI ARCHIVE </p><p>(RELATING TO THE BERLIN NUNCIATURE).  THE DELEGATION </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM IS "A BRANCH OF THE </p><p>U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT" AND HAS A STRONG RECORD OF WORKING </p><p>WITH OTHER OFFICIAL ARCHIVES TO COMPILE A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>HOLOCAUST-RELATED ARCHIVE AT THE MUSEUM.  MR. SHAPIRO NOTED </p><p>THAT HIS DIVISION WITHIN THE MUSEUM HAS DEVELOPED A STRONG </p><p>RECORD OF BALANCED SCHOLARSHIP ON THE HOLOCAUST.  ALSO IN </p><p>THAT REGARD, MR. IOANU MENTIONED THAT HE AND HIS STAFF HAD </p><p>WORKED FROM OFFICIAL ARCHIVES IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, </p><p>AS WELL AS IN THE U.S. ARCHIVES, TO COMPILE A </p><p>PHOTOCOPY/MICROFICHE RECORD OF HOLOCAUST-ERA DOCUMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CARDINAL MEJIA RECEIVED THE DELEGATION IN HIS OFFICE </p><p>FOR OVER AN HOUR, AND RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THE U.S. </p><p>PROPOSALS FOR COLLABORATION.  SHAPIRO MENTIONED TO MEJIA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01046  01 OF 02  131459Z </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY OF OFFERING ASSISTANCE TO VATICAN PERSONNEL </p><p>WORKING TO CATALOGUE UNOPENED ARCHIVES FROM THE PERIOD </p><p>1923-1939.  (NOTE: ARCHIVES FROM THE WAR PERIOD ITSELF WILL </p><p>NOT BEGIN TO BE CATALOGUED IN PREPARATION FOR RELEASE UNTIL </p><p>THE FULL SET FROM THE PIUS XI PONTIFICATE ARE FULLY </p><p>CATALOGUED AND RELEASED -- WHICH WILL TAKE AT LEAST ANOTHER </p><p>YEAR).  CARDINAL MEJIA THOUGHT THE HOLY SEE MIGHT WISH TO </p><p>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE U.S. OFFER TO REGISTER AND MICROFICHE </p><p>DOCUMENTS FROM THE PIUS XI PONTIFICATE THAT HAD NOT YET </p><p>BEEN RELEASED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MEJIA EXPLAINED THAT THE VATICAN HAS RESOURCE </p><p>LIMITATIONS THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CATALOGUE, </p><p>DECLASSIFY AND RELEASE DOCUMENTS AS QUICKLY AS MANY </p><p>GOVERNMENTS CAN.  HE SAID THE VATICAN IS INTERESTED IN </p><p>PUTTING AS MANY DOCUMENTS AS POSSIBLE ON MICROFICHE AND CD- </p><p>ROM, SO THAT SCHOLARS CAN ACCESS THEM.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>VATICAN SECRET ARCHIVE DATES TO THE PONTIFICATE OF INNOCENT </p><p>III (1180 AD).  THE VATICAN\'S PRIORITY IS TO DIGITIZE ITS </p><p>EARLIEST DOCUMENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE THEY ARE </p><p>FRAGILE AND DETERIORATING.  TO DATE, THE VATICAN HAS </p><p>DEVELOPED A THREE CD-ROM SET FOR THE EARLIEST PERIODS (1180 </p><p>TO 1504).  WITH ONLY 45 PEOPLE ON THE ENTIRE </p><p>LIBRARY/ARCHIVE PAYROLL, HOWEVER, PROGRESS IN DIGITIZING </p><p>MORE MODERN RECORD WILL BE SLOW IN COMING IN THE ABSENCE OF </p><p>OUTSIDE HELP. </p><p> </p><p>5.  CATALOGUING AND RELEASING FOR STUDY THE MORE RECENT </p><p>PAPER RECORDS ARE, HOWEVER, DEALT WITH SEPARATELY, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MEJIA.  THE VATICAN HAS HIRED TWO ADDITIONAL </p><p>ARCHIVISTS (MAKING FIVE IN TOTAL) TO WORK ON RELEASING 20TH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01046  01 OF 02  131459Z </p><p>CENTURY RECORDS.  THESE ARCHIVISTS HAVE FOCUSED ON </p><p>DECLASSIFYING THE PIUS XI RECORDS (1923-1939) AND, IN AN </p><p>EXCEPTION TO NORMAL PROCESS, HAVE RELEASED THE ENTIRE SET </p><p>OF BERLIN NUNCIATURE DOCUMENTS IN ADVANCE OF THE REST OF </p><p>THE PONTIFICATE\'S RECORDS.  (NOTE: THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM </p><p>DELEGATION LATER RECEIVED ACCESS ID CARDS FOR THE ARCHIVE </p><p>AND WAS ABLE TO BRIEFLY SURVEY THE BERLIN RECORDS). </p><p> </p><p>6.  GIVEN THE INTENSE INTERNATIONAL INTEREST IN SCHOLARSHIP </p><p>ON THE VATICAN\'S ROLE DURING THE HOLOCAUST, MEJIA MADE </p><p>CLEAR HIS INTEREST IN WORKING WITH THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM. </p><p>HE ASKED THE MUSEUM DELEGATION TO PUT ITS PROPOSALS INTO A </p><p>LETTER THAT HE WOULD SHARE WITH THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE </p><p>(WHICH HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR RELATIONS WITH STATES).  HE </p><p>FURTHER URGED THE GROUP TO GET HIM THAT LETTER AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE, SINCE, AT THE AGE OF 81, HE WAS PAST RETIREMENT </p><p>AGE AND SERVING AT THE PLEASURE OF THE POPE AND, HE ADDED, </p><p>OF HIS MAKER.  MR. SHAPIRO TOLD US HE WOULD SEND THAT </p><p>LETTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2676 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01046  02 OF 02  131459Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    UTED-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NEA-00   NSAE-00  PA-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  R-00     DSCC-00  LBA-00   PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /001W </p><p>                  ------------------43CF66  131709Z /38 </p><p>R 131354Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TEL AVIV </p><p>AMCONSUL JERUSALEM </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 001046 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); EUR/OHI, NEA/IAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KNAR, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLOCAUST MUSEUM DELEGATION WORKS IN SECRET </p><p>ARCHIVES, OFFERS COLLABORATION TO CATALOGUE CLOSED RECORDS </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT:  WE ANTICIPATE THAT CARDINAL MEJIA WILL FOLLOW </p><p>THROUGH QUICKLY ON THE MUSEUM\'S PROPOSAL, AND WOULD </p><p>ENCOURAGE THE MUSEUM TO SUBMIT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE </p><p>VATICAN HAS BEEN STUNG BY A SERIES OF HIGHLY CRITICAL AND </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN "POORLY RESEARCHED" BOOKS ON PIUS </p><p>XII\'S ROLE DURING THE HOLOCAUST.  THE RECENT RELEASE OF THE </p><p>FILM "AMEN" BY COSTAS GRAVAS, WHICH PURPORTS TO PROVE THAT </p><p>THE CHURCH UNDER PIUS XII TURNED A BIND EYE TO THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01046  02 OF 02  131459Z </p><p>HOLOCAUST HAS ADDED TO THE HOLY SEE\'S SENSITIVITY.  THEY </p><p>WILL THEREFORE WANT TO ENSURE THAT SERIOUS SCHOLARSHIP ON </p><p>THIS PERIOD IS SUPPORTED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO EXPOSE THE </p><p>TRUTH.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY BELIEVE THAT A BALANCED </p><p>READING OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES WILL REVEAL THAT THE CHURCH </p><p>AND MANY CLERGY DID MUCH TO SAVE JEWS DURING THE HOLOCAUST, </p><p>SOMETIMES AT GREAT PERSONAL RISK. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA01046 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
