(U) On December 20, Ana Cristina Mejia de Pereira, </p><p>President of the National Banking and Insurance Commission, </p><p>announced the liquidation of Banco Capital which, along with </p><p>Banco Sogerin, had been under the supervision of the </p><p>Honduran Deposit Insurance Fund (Fosede) since May 17 after </p><p>the bank was found to be undercapitalized and have high </p><p>levels of related lending and a deteriorating loan portfolio </p><p>(see reftel). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In a December 30 meeting, Pereira told Econcouns </p><p>that the government-appointed supervisors discovered </p><p>previously unknown non-performing loans and new cases of </p><p>insider lending that had increased the bank\'s insolvency, </p><p>pushed the bank\'s legal reserve requirement beneath the </p><p>minimum six percent as required by law and ultimately forced </p><p>the liquidation of Banco Capital.  The Commission is </p><p>preparing an exhaustive report on evidence of violations by </p><p>Capital\'s principal shareholder, Ivis Lopez, to assist the </p><p>Public Ministry in pressing charges.  Pereira confided that </p><p>the original plan was to liquidate Banco Capital last May </p><p>when the bank was intervened.  However, due to concerns that </p><p>closing two banks at that time could cause significant </p><p>amount of capital flight from several other banks, the </p><p>Banking Commission decided to hold off liquidating Capital </p><p>to avoid a banking crisis. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Banco Ficohsa acquired Capital\'s deposits worth 730 </p><p>million lempiras (approx. USD 43 million).  Due to low </p><p>offers, the loan portfolio was not sold.  The government </p><p>hopes to recover approximately USD 100,000 through the sale </p><p>of the remaining assets.  Fosede, which is required by law </p><p>to guarantee deposits up to 150,000 lempiras, originally had </p><p>set aside only 213 million lempiras (approx. USD 12.6 </p><p>million) to guarantee the deposits.  After the sale of the </p><p>assets, the Council of Ministers agreed to transfer 517.7 </p><p>million lempiras (approx. USD 30.7 million) from the </p><p>accounts of the state-owned telephone company Hondutel to </p><p>cover the remaining Capital deposits.  Honduran law requires </p><p>the government to guarantee 100 percent of the deposits </p><p>until September 2003.  Pereira believes the final cost will </p><p>be lower (currently, Ficohsa is reporting that most Capital </p><p>depositors are leaving their accounts open). </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Pereira commented that Banco Sogerin\'s </p><p>recapitalization effort was more successful.  As opposed to </p><p>Capital, which had many outstanding loans in the agriculture </p><p>sector and few assets, Sogerin possessed properties and </p><p>other assets which helped the government-appointed </p><p>supervisors make the bank solvent.  The Banking Commission </p><p>has commissioned an appraisal of plans Sogerin\'s worth, due </p><p>to be completed in February.  It will be sold shortly </p><p>thereafter.  So far Honduran bank Occidente, regional bank </p><p>LAFISE and Salvadoran bank Cuscatlan have all expressed </p><p>interest in acquiring Sogerin. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Pereira also remarked that implementation of Basel </p><p>rules on capitalization requirements will lead to eventual </p><p>bank mergers.  Banco Futuro and the Armed Forces Bank </p><p>(BANFFAA) are both reportedly up for sale.  Shareholders in </p><p>Banco del Pais, in contrast, have chosen to add funds as </p><p>part of a recapitalization effort. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment:  Although not mentioned during briefings </p><p>for the press or donors, the November IMF mission apparently </p><p>urged immediate closure of Capital and quick sale of </p><p>Sogerin.  Pereira appeared confident that the current </p><p>financial sector measures will satisfy the Fund.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
