<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002232 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S SOUTHEAST: LEADING MARDIN M.P.S SUPPORT </p><p>U.S. -- WHILE HAKKARI DYP BACKS "THE STATE" </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 2018 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1631 </p><p>     C. ADANA 95 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Prominent Kurdish M.P.s representing the </p><p>border province of Mardin for both ruling AK and opposition </p><p>CHP support the U.S.-led war against Saddam.  Despite (1) </p><p>pressure from elements within AK, (2) outright hostility from </p><p>the CHP and the Turkish State, and (3) the ethnically Turkish </p><p>public\'s strong anti-war sentiment, these M.P.s tell us </p><p>their own personal and regional political interests, and </p><p>those of their constituents, are supported by the USG </p><p>approach, not the approach of Ankara.  Meanwhile, an M.P. </p><p>representing Hakkari for right-of-center DYP -- which is </p><p>trying to revive its fortunes by tying itself to the security </p><p>forces -- charges that the USG is supporting Turkey\'s enemies </p><p>including the N. Iraqi Kurdish "bandits," the PKK, and </p><p>Kurdish Hizbullah.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Memo to Baykal: Give It A Rest </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CHP deputy Mahmut Duyan, scion of the huge Duyan </p><p>Kurdish tribe in the Mardin Turkey-Syria-Iraq area, told us </p><p>April 4 he has faced a barrage of criticism from party </p><p>colleagues and associated media because he rented property to </p><p>the U.S. military in the region.  Flipping through a file of </p><p>newspaper articles lambasting his business deals with the </p><p>U.S., Duyan noted that the reaction against him has only </p><p>reinforced his support for U.S. efforts in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Indeed, Duyan declared that "I would now be willing to </p><p>provide land for free to the U.S.  My conscience is clear." </p><p>He asserted that in any event he had joined CHP only to </p><p>receive financial assistance for the November 2002  national </p><p>elections.  He also noted that the Duyan tribe is </p><p>theoretically large enough to provide enough votes for an </p><p>independent seat in the legislature.  Duyan, formerly with </p><p>right-of-center DYP that long dominated the province, claimed </p><p>that CHP "now needs me more than I need them." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Memo to Tayyip: Listen Up -- Because TGS Doesn\'t </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) April 3 an AK Party M.P., a leading conservative </p><p>figure in both Mardin and the wider region, gave us a </p><p>pro-U.S., decidedly anti-Turkish State view.  "The Turkish </p><p>state has absolutely no right -- none -- to intervene </p><p>unilaterally in northern Iraq" under any conditions, the M.P. </p><p>said.  If the Turkish military does so, it will have face a </p><p>Kurdish uprising in Turkey that will make the PKK pale by </p><p>comparison, he stated.  The criticism emanating from AK </p><p>elements and the Establishment alike regarding alleged USG </p><p>"massacres" of civilians in Iraq is simply ridiculous, he </p><p>asserted.  He then produced a large, framed poster of the </p><p>results of Saddam\'s chemical attack on Halabja in 1988, </p><p>noting that Turks remain largely silent about the Baath\'ist </p><p>regime\'s ongoing atrocities against civilians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) "We (Kurds) have real problems throughout the region" </p><p>-- political, economic, and social -- the M.P. explained. </p><p>Instead of dealing with these, however, the Turkish State, </p><p>"as represented by the military," insists on an approach that </p><p>over time has only humiliated the Kurds and made them feel </p><p>less tied to Ankara.  "Throughout the region you see </p><p>mountains with messages carved into them that proclaim that </p><p>Turkey is for the Turks.  Why don\'t you see the same in </p><p>Kastamonu or Corum" or elsewhere in ethnically Turkish </p><p>central Anatolia, he asked rhetorically.  The deputy added </p><p>that he repeatedly gives the same message to P.M. Erdogan, </p><p>who knows he has a problem; meanwhile, the military and other </p><p>elements of the Turkish State refuse to listen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The M.P. observed that the various tribes, landlords </p><p>(aghas), and tarikat lodges retain considerable influence in </p><p>the southeast.  The current "feudal structure" in Mardin, he </p><p>said, is closely tied to the Turkish State, which uses it to </p><p>manipulate politics and keep the region under control.  He </p><p>expressed hope, however, that the tribes and tarikats would </p><p>in the future be able to play a more "positive" role </p><p>regarding Kurdish issues.  While there are still some </p><p>diehards that support the approach of Ankara, "90 percent of </p><p>the people now have their eyes open" to the realities on the </p><p>ground in Mardin and elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>DYP: Remnants of Susurluk </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DYP, long in control of the Mardin municipality, has </p><p>long been seen by the Turkish State as a political means to </p><p>keep the province and the wider region "stable" -- as </p><p>evidenced in part by the 1996 Susurluk scandal and the nexus </p><p>of security forces, primarily DYP M.P.s, and organized crime </p><p>groups that fought the PKK.  That nexus still involves some </p><p>DYP elements in the southeast, who retain their sizeable </p><p>paramilitary "village guard" cadres -- DYP M.P. Mehmet Tatar </p><p>from nearby Hakkari being one prominent example.  He asserted </p><p>to us March 17 that: (1) the USG supports not only the </p><p>northern Iraqi Kurds but indirectly the terrorist PKK and </p><p>Turkish "Hizbullah" (comment: the latter in fact created by </p><p>the security forces to combat Kurdish "separatism." End </p><p>comment); (2) he has presented files detailing alleged </p><p>nefarious USG activities to both TGS and President Sezer, </p><p>"who are very worried about the emergence on an independent </p><p>Kurdish state"; (3) Turkey should invade northern Iraq on its </p><p>own to protect Turkish interests; and (4) he, personally, </p><p>with his "thousands" of village guards, is "the guarantor of </p><p>the Turkish State" in his chunk of the southeast. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Iraq question has brought to the fore how little </p><p>Ankara has done throughout the life of the Republic of Turkey </p><p>to address the political, economic, and social questions of a </p><p>significant number of citizens who are ever more aware of </p><p>their Kurdishness. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
