<p>UNCLAS USUN NEW YORK 000718 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, UNSC, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: ELEMENTS OF UK/U.S./SPAIN STATEMENT ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) IN COMMENTS TO THE PRESS BEFORE INFORMAL </p><p>CONSULTATIONS, MARCH 17, UK PERMREP GREENSTOCK, ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS AND AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE, ISSUED A </p><p>JOINT STATEMENT ON IRAQ. FOLLOWING GREENSTOCK\'S COMMENTS, </p><p>AMBASSADORS NEGROPONTE AND ARIAS PROVIDED STATEMENTS TO THE </p><p>PRESS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ELEMENTS OF UK/U.S./SPAIN STATEMENT ON IRAQ AS PRESENTED BY </p><p>UK PERMREP GREENSTOCK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD IN THE LAST FEW </p><p>DAYS IN A FINAL EFFORT TO SEEK A COUNCIL CONSENSUS ON IRAQ. </p><p>IN AN EFFORT TO REUNITE THE COUNCIL, THE UNITED KINGDOM </p><p>PROPOSED LAST WEEK AN ULTIMATUM WHICH WOULD CHALLENGE IRAQ TO </p><p>TAKE A STRATEGIC DECISION TO DISARM. </p><p> </p><p>THERE WERE THREE KEY ELEMENTS TO THE COMPROMISE WE PROPOSED: </p><p> </p><p>-TOUGH BUT REALIZABLE TESTS, INCLUDING AN UNEQUIVOCAL </p><p>COMMITMENT TO DISARMAMENT BY SADDAM HUSSEIN; </p><p> </p><p>-A REALISTIC BUT TIGHT TIMETABLE FOR COMPLETION OF THOSE </p><p>TESTS GIVEN THE URGENT NEED FOR IRAQ TO COMPLY AFTER 12 YEARS </p><p>OF PREVARICATION; </p><p> </p><p>-AND, THIRD, AN UNDERSTANDING THAT IF IRAQ FAILED THE TESTS, </p><p>SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES WOULD ENSUE AS SET OUT IN RESOLUTION </p><p>1441. </p><p></p><p>HAVING HELD FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNCIL MEMBERS OVER THE </p><p>WEEKEND AND IN THE LAST FEW HOURS, WE HAVE HAD TO CONCLUDE </p><p>THAT COUNCIL CONSENSUS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE IN LINE WITH </p><p>RESOLUTION 1441.  ONE COUNTRY IN PARTICULAR HAS UNDERLINED </p><p>ITS INTENTION TO VETO ANY ULTIMATUM "NO MATTER WHAT THE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES."  THAT COUNTRY REJECTED OUR PROPOSED </p><p>COMPROMISE BEFORE EVEN THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT ITSELF AND HAS </p><p>PUT FORWARD SUGGESTIONS THAT WOULD ROW BACK ON THE UNANIMOUS </p><p>AGREEMENT OF THE COUNCIL IN 1441 - THOSE SUGGESTIONS WOULD </p><p>AMOUNT TO NO ULTIMATUM/NO PRESSURE/NO DISARMAMENT; </p><p> </p><p>GIVEN THIS SITUATION, WE HAVE AGREED THAT WE WILL NOT PURSUE </p><p>A VOTE ON THE DRAFT UK/U.S./SPANISH RESOLUTION IN BLUE; </p><p> </p><p>THE COMMUNIQUES AND PRESS STATEMENTS THAT WERE ISSUED AT THE </p><p>AZORES SUMMIT EXPLAIN THE POSITION OF OUR GOVERNMENTS ON THE </p><p>WAY FORWARD.  THE CO-SPONSORS RESERVE THEIR RIGHT TO TAKE </p><p>THEIR OWN STEPS TO SECURE THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TRANSCRIPT OF AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE\'S COMMENTS TO THE PRESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE:  GOOD MORNING.  CAN YOU HEAR </p><p>ME?  I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE ASSOCIATE OURSELVES FULLY </p><p>WITH THE STATEMENT MADE BY AMBASSADOR GREENSTOCK. </p><p> </p><p>I WOULD JUST MAKE THE FURTHER POINT THAT IT HAS BEEN NEARLY </p><p>FOUR AND HALF MONTHS SINCE THE COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED </p><p>RESOLUTION 1441, WHICH FOUND IRAQ IN MATERIAL BREACH AND GAVE </p><p>IT A FINAL OPPORTUNITY TO DISARM OR FACE SERIOUS </p><p>CONSEQUENCES. </p><p></p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ HAS CLEARLY FAILED TO COMPLY. OUR </p><p>GOVERNMENTS BELIEVE THAT THROUGH ACTS OF OMISSION AND </p><p>COMMISSION IRAQ IS NOW IN FURTHER MATERIAL BREACH. </p><p> </p><p>WE ADVOCATED A SECOND RESOLUTION BECAUSE A UNITED COUNCIL </p><p>WOULD HAVE SHOWN IT WAS INTENT ON ENFORCING RESOLUTION 1441 </p><p>AND DISARMING IRAQ. WE BELIEVE THAT THE VOTE WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>CLOSE. WE REGRET THAT IN THE FACE OF AN EXPLICIT THREAT TO </p><p>VETO BY A PERMANENT MEMBER, THE VOTE COUNTING BECAME A </p><p>SECONDARY CONSIDERATION.  THANK YOU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LAST OPPORTUNITY WAS SURRENDERED </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) IN HIS COMMENTS TO THE PRESS, SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS </p><p>STATED THAT UNSCR 1441 WAS QUITE CLEAR IN PARAGRAPH FOUR, </p><p>WHICH ESTABLISHED IN AN UNEQUIVOCAL WAY THAT ANY FALSE </p><p>STATEMENT OR OMISSION ON THE PART OF IRAQ WOULD CONSTITUTE A </p><p>FURTHER MATERIAL BREACH. ARIAS ADDED THAT IRAQ HAD BEEN GIVEN </p><p>ONE LAST OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLY, WHICH IT SURRENDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEGROPONTE </p><p></p></div>
