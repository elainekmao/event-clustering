<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000592 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS TARGET GOVERNMENT VEHICLES, OFFICES IN </p><p>KATHMANDU BEFORE NATIONAL STRIKE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) KATHMANDU 0570 </p><p> </p><p>     B. B) KATHMANDU 0340 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Michael Hoza.  Reason:  1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In a series of weekend attacks within the </p><p>capital and its environs, Maoist insurgents bombed Government </p><p>of Nepal (GON) vehicles and offices, including </p><p>telecommunications facilities and the office of the </p><p>state-owned press.  The attacks come as the Maoists attempt </p><p>to marshal popular support for--or popular fear of </p><p>defying--the nationwide strike they have called for April 2-6 </p><p>(Ref A).  That the Maoists were able to pull off these </p><p>attacks in the heart of the Kathmandu Valley, where the </p><p>presence of the security forces is the strongest and most </p><p>highly visible, indicates that the GON will have its hands </p><p>full during the coming week to reassure the general public </p><p>that it can guarantee safety for those who follow GON </p><p>exhortations to defy the strike.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  From March 23-25 Maoist insurgents launched a series </p><p>of small-scale attacks against GON targets--primarily </p><p>vehicles--within Kathmandu and its immediate environs.  On </p><p>March 23 insurgents hurled a pipe bomb at a police van in </p><p>Pathan (within the Kathmandu metropolitan area), injuring two </p><p>policemen.  In the early morning hours of March 24, about 15 </p><p>Maoists reportedly threw petrol bombs at four GON-owned </p><p>vehicles parked at the Nepal Telecommunications Corporation </p><p>(NTC) exchange in Hattigauda, about 4 km north of the city, </p><p>completely destroying all four cars.  The same day, a group </p><p>of Maoists torched several NTC vehicles in Dachh, about 15 km </p><p>east of the capital, while another group attacked a vehicle </p><p>and transmitter at a third NTC office in Thali, about 12 km </p><p>east of Kathmandu.  In Kathmandu itself, suspected insurgents </p><p>bombed and damaged four GON vehicles parked at an auto repair </p><p>shop the morning of March 24.  A petrol bomb was also hurled </p><p>at a Road Department vehicle traveling within the city March </p><p>24, but no one was injured.  A vehicle belonging to the </p><p>Ministry of Education parked at a secondary school in </p><p>Kathmandu was destroyed by a bomb March 25. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  In an incident mirroring the Feb. 12 attack on a </p><p>Kathmandu Tax Office (Ref B), on March 25 suspected Maoists </p><p>set off an explosive device in the bathroom of the </p><p>state-owned Gorkhapatra press, injuring one person.  Despite </p><p>the injury, damage to the rest of the building is not </p><p>extensive. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment:  With their apparent ability to penetrate </p><p>the security forces\' cordon around--and even </p><p>within--Kathmandu, the Maoists seem to be sending a message </p><p>to the general public that, despite GON claims to the </p><p>contrary (Ref A), the police and army will be hard pressed to </p><p>guarantee the safety of anyone who defies the April 2-6 </p><p>general strike, or "bandh," called by the insurgents. </p><p>Although there may be scant popular support for the Maoists </p><p>or their burdensome bandh, there is substantial fear that the </p><p>Maoists may enforce the bandh with violence which the </p><p>security forces will be ill prepared to counter.  The </p><p>weekend\'s events have done little to calm these jitters or to </p><p>promote faltering public confidence in the ability of the GON </p><p>to squelch the bandh.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
