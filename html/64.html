<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 12 RIYADH 04906 </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, MCAP, MASS, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: THE ROLE OF SAUDI PRINCES IN UNIFORM </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  THE PRESENCE OF A NUMBER OF SAUDI </p><p>ROYAL FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE MILITARY--WE CAN IDENTIFY </p><p>MORE THAN 25 AND THERE ARE CLEARLY OTHERS--HAS LONG </p><p>BEEN A SUBJECT OF INTEREST.  ALSO THE FOCUS OF </p><p>CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S </p><p>WELL CALCULATED EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN CAREFUL CONTROL </p><p>OVER THE MILITARY, TO PRECLUDE ITS BECOMING A THREAT </p><p>TO THE REGIME.  THESE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN COMPLICATED </p><p>IN RECENT YEARS BY THE OFTEN  CONTRADICTORY DEMANDS </p><p>FOR AN EFFICIENT, WELL EQUIPPED  FORCE TO RESPOND </p><p>TO REAL THREATS.  A KEY QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PRINCELY </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE MILITARY IS PART OF THE ROYAL FAMILY </p><p>CONTROL MECHANISM.  BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER IMPORTANT </p><p>QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE ROYAL PRESENCE IN THE </p><p>MILITARY:  IF NOT THERE AS PART OF A CONCERTED EFFORT </p><p>TO MAINTAIN ROYAL CONTROL, WHAT ARE THE ATTRACTIONS </p><p>OF THE MILITARY FOR PRINCES WHO APPEAR TO HAVE NO </p><p>SHORTAGE OF CAREER CHOICES?  WHAT IMPACT DO PRINCES </p><p>IN UNIFORM HAVE ON MILITARY EFFICIENCY AND UNIT </p><p>MORALE GIVEN THEIR SPECIAL STATUS? </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF A GENERALLY CONCEIVED </p><p>PLAN TO MAINTAIN PRINCELY CONTROL OF THE MILITARY, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY IN THE PLACEMENT OF THE MOST SENIOR </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY IN POSITIONS OF CIVILIAN </p><p>CONTROL OVER ALL UNIFORMED ELEMENTS--DEFENSE, </p><p>NATIONAL GUARD AND INTERIOR, INCLUDING ITS PARA- </p><p>MILITARY FORCES.  GOING FURTHER, THE PREPONDERANCE </p><p>OF PRINCELY PRESENCE IN THE LAND AND AIR FORCES, THE </p><p>TWO STRONGEST ELEMENTS OF THE MILITARY, AND THE </p><p>EY POSITIONS HELD BY CERTAIN OF THE UNIFORMED PRINCES, </p><p>SUGGESTS A BROADER DESIGN FOR ROYAL PRESENCE AND </p><p>CONTROL.  BUT THERE ARE COUNTER SIGNALS, PROBABLY </p><p>MOST IMPORTANT BEING REAL QUESTIONS AS TO HOW </p><p>EFFECTIVE SUCH CONTROL MIGHT BE, GIVEN THE DIVERSITY </p><p>OF INTERESTS WITHIN THE ROYAL FAMILY.  JUNIOR </p><p>PRINCES IN MANY CASES HAVE VERY LITTLE REASON TO </p><p>FEAR THE IMPOSITION OF DIRECT CONTROLS FROM THE KING. </p><p>OVERALL, IT IS OUR JUDGEMENT THAT THERE IS MORE </p><p>APPEARANCE THAN REALITY TO THE CONCEPT OF MILITARY </p><p>PRINCES, BELOW THE VERY TOP LEVELS, BEING CAREFULLY </p><p>PLACED WITH THE AIM OF ENHANCING FAMILY CONTROL. </p><p>THIS JUDGEMENT IS REINFORCED BY OTHER SOLID </p><p>ALTERNATIVE REASONS FOR PRINCES TO JOIN THE MILITARY: </p><p>GLAMOUR AND EXCITEMENT, THE HISTORICALLY HONORABLE </p><p>STATUS OF MILITARY SERVICE, BUSINESS SPIN-OFFS FROM </p><p>THE LARGE MILITARY BUDGET, AND EVEN USE OF THE </p><p>MILITARY AS A STEPPING STONE FOR BIGGER THINGS. </p><p>WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THE DEGREE TO WHICH </p><p>PRINCES EXERT A STABILIZING EFFECT IN THE MILITARY, </p><p>THEIR MERE PRESENCE SHOULD BE OF SOME BENEFIT TO THE </p><p>REGIME.  HAVING PRINCES IN THE ARMED FORCES, REGARDLESS </p><p>OF THEIR MOTIVES FOR BEING THERE, DOES PROVIDE A CERTAIN </p><p>DEGREE OF INFLUENCE AND OVERSIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>AS FOR THE IMPACT OF UNIFORMED PRINCES ON MILITARY </p><p>MORALE AND EFFICIENCY, THIS CUTS BOTH WAYS.  CLEARLY, </p><p>THEY DO COMMAND SPECIAL TREATMENT AND ARE LESS BOUND </p><p>BY MILITARY DISCIPLINE, WITH RESULTING RESENTMENT. </p><p>BUT SPECIAL TREATMENT IS NOT LIMITED TO PRINCES IN </p><p>THE MILITARY; STRICT MILITARY DISCIPLINE IS NOT IN </p><p>THE OVERALL SAUDI TRADITION; AND A NUMBER OF THE </p><p>MILITARY PRINCES MORE THAN BALANCE THE NEGATIVES </p><p>WITH THE HIGH QUALITY OF THEIR MILITARY ABILITY. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  INTRODUCTION.  WHEN WE SPEAK OF MILITARY FORCES </p><p>IN SAUDI ARABIA, WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT FORCES UNDER </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION (MODA), THE </p><p>SAUDI ARABIAN NATIONAL GUARD (SANG) AS WELL AS THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES, FRONTIER FORCES AND COAST GUARD </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR (MOI). </p><p>HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF DISCUSSING THE ROLE OF </p><p>PRINCES IN THE MILITARY, THIS REPORT IS CONFINED </p><p>TO THE TWO MORE CLASSICAL MILITARY INSTITUTIONS, THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION AND THE SAUDI ARABIAN </p><p>NATIONAL GUARD.  THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS </p><p>REPORT DRAWS HEAVILY ON THE U.S. SECURITY ASSISTANCE </p><p>ELEMENTS IN SAUDI ARABIA, CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL WHO DEAL </p><p>WITH THE ARMED FORCES AS WELL AS THE EXPERIENCES OF </p><p>EMBASSY PERSONNEL.  IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO </p><p>UNDERTAKE ANY MEANINGFUL EFFORT TO PLUMB THE SAUDI </p><p>PUBLIC OR MILITARY CONCERNING THEIR OWN, PERSONAL </p><p>FEELINGS.  SOCIAL PRESSURE, CULTURAL BIAS, FEAR OF </p><p>REPRISAL AND PLAIN DISTRUST OF FOREIGNERS ARE POWERFUL </p><p>IMPEDIMENTS TO DIRECT INFORMATION GATHERING.  WE </p><p>RECOGNIZE THEREFORE THAT OUR LIST OF PRINCES IS NOT </p><p>COMPLETE, THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER FACTORS WE </p><p>MAY NOT HAVE GIVEN THEIR PROPER EMPHASES, AND THAT </p><p>SUBJECTIVITY MUST ENTER INTO OUR JUDGEMENTS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING THESE DISADVANTAGES, THE INFORMATION </p><p>PROVIDED IN THIS REPORT PRESENTS THE BEST PICTURE </p><p>AVAILABLE OF THE ROLE OF PRINCES IN THE SAUDI ARABIAN </p><p>ARMED FORCES AND REPRESENTS A STARTING POINT ON THIS </p><p>USEFUL SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE PRESENCE OF MORE THAN 25 UNIFORMED PRINCES IN </p><p>THE SAUDI ARABIAN ARMED FORCES RAISES A NUMBER OF </p><p>INTERESTING QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE ROLE PLAYED BY </p><p>THESE ROYAL OFFSPRING.  HOW THESE PRINCES AFFECT THE </p><p>STABILITY OF THE MILITARY AS WELL AS THEIR INFLUENCE ON </p><p>ITS EFFICIENCY AND CREDIBILITY AS A FIGHTING FORCE ARE </p><p>PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS.  IS ROYAL MILITARY </p><p>SERVICE THE RESULT, TO A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE, OF </p><p>AN ORCHESTRATED PLAN BY THE ROYAL FAMILY TO MAINTAIN </p><p>A DIVERSIFIED PRESENCE IN AND CHECK ON THE MILITARY? </p><p>WHY WOULD A PRINCE, WHO SUPPOSEDLY HAS EVERYTHING HE </p><p>COULD POSSIBLY WANT, JOIN THE MILITARY?  HOW ENCUMBERED </p><p>BY MILITARY DISCIPLINE IS HE?  WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON </p><p>UNIT MORALE AND DISCIPLINE WHEN A PRINCE JOINS THE </p><p>OUTFIT?  DO THESE PRINCES HAVE MUCH INFLUENCE OVER </p><p>MILITARY DECISION MAKING?  IF SO, HOW FAR DOES THEIR </p><p>AUTHORITY EXTEND INTO POLICY MAKING?  DO THEY "ROUGH IT" </p><p>OR ARE THEY A PRIVILEGED LOT RELATIVELY EXEMPT FROM </p><p>UNDERGOING HARDSHIP? </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE SAUDIS ARE EXTREMELY SECRETIVE ABOUT THEIR </p><p>ROYAL AFFAIRS, AS THEY ARE ABOUT THE DEFENSE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT, AND IT IS THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW MANY PRINCES ARE IN MILITARY </p><p>SERVICE.  THE FOLLOWING LIST NOTES THOSE WHOSE DUTIES </p><p>HAVE BROUGHT THEM TO THE MISSION\'S ATTENTION OR WHO </p><p>WERE INTRODUCED IN CHANCE MEETINGS.  ONE FURTHER </p><p>DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING WHO IS OR IS NOT A PRINCE </p><p>IS THE COMMONALITY OF NAMES.  WHILE SOME ARE RELATED </p><p>CLOSELY ENOUGH  TO ABDUL AZIZ FOR THEIR ANCESTRY TO </p><p>BE APPARENT, EACH GENERATION ADDS ANOTHER LAYER OF </p><p>NAMES, CAUSING FAMILY ORIGIN TO BE INCREASINGLY </p><p>OBSCURED TO OUTSIDERS.  SOME PREVIOUSLY KNOWN OFFICERS </p><p>HAVE DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT.  THIS LIST IS THEREFORE </p><p>NOT ALL INCLUSIVE.  BESIDES THE UNIFORMED PRINCES </p><p>CONTAINED IN THE LIST, THERE ARE ALSO A LARGE NUMBER </p><p>OF CIVILIAN PRINCES IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN ALL </p><p>THE MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p>- </p><p>-                 MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>- </p><p>-SAUDI ARABIAN LAND FORCES (SALF)------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>-        NAME                 RANK/POSITION (IF KNOWN) </p><p> </p><p>AHMED B.

IT IS INEVITABLE THAT, WITH THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY </p><p>NOW ESTIMATED TO NUMBER MORE THAN 5,000 MALE MEMBERS, </p><p>SOME OF THESE PRINCES SHOULD FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE </p><p>ARMED FORCES.  IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE </p><p>PLAYED BY THE SENIOR PRINCES; THEY ARE THE MINISTERS </p><p>AND SENIOR FUNCTIONARIES AT THE VERY TOP OF THE VARIOUS </p><p>MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS, ENSURING POLITICAL CONTROL AND </p><p>RESPONSIVENESS.  MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND IS THE </p><p>PLACE AND PURPOSE OF JUNIOR PRINCES IN MILITARY SERVICE, </p><p>THOSE IN UNIFORM AND STARTING, AT LEAST, AS JUNIOR </p><p>OFFICERS.  SINCE THE LOYALTY OF ITS ARMED FORCES HAS </p><p>A CLEAR IMPACT ON THE STABILITY OF AL SAUD RULE, </p><p>AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE "ROYAL CONNECTION" WITH </p><p>MILITARY SERVICE IS USEFUL IN JUDGING HOW THE ROYAL </p><p>FAMILY FEELS ABOUT AND DEALS WITH ITS MILITARY </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT, AND HOW NON-ROYAL OFFICERS VIEW THEIR </p><p>AL SAUD COMRADES IN ARMS.   END INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE AL SAUD MONARCHY IS HIGHLY CONSCIOUS OF THE </p><p>UTILITY OF A MODERN MILITARY FORCE AND HAS SPENT </p><p>BILLIONS IN AN EFFORT TO CREATE ONE.  A WELL-TRAINED </p><p>AND SUPERBLY-EQUIPPED MILITARY FORCE IS NOT ONLY VITAL </p><p>TO THE DEFENSE OF THE FRONTIERS, RESOURCES AND RULING </p><p>REGIME IN SAUDI ARABIA AGAINST OUTSIDE AGGRESSION </p><p>BUT IS ALSO USEFUL AS A SYMBOL OF SAUDI NATIONALISM-- </p><p>FOSTERING POPULAR ATTACHMENT TO THE AL SAUD DYNASTY, </p><p>AS DISTINGUISHED FROM OLDER FOCAL POINTS OF LOYALTY </p><p>AND MOTIVATION SUCH AS ARAB LINEAGE OR ISLAMIC FAITH. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE AL SAUD DYNASTS HAVE SEEN MUSLIM </p><p>MONARCHIES FALL TO COUPS D\'ETAT MOUNTED BY MILITARY </p><p>OFFICERS.  THE HISTORY OF THE REGION OFFERS MANY </p><p>EXAMPLES, SUCH AS EGYPT, IRAQ, AND LIBYA, IN WHICH </p><p>THE ARMED FORCES OF THE COUNTRY, STRENGTHENED AND </p><p>MODERNIZED, HAVE OVERTHROWN THE MONARCHIAL REGIME </p><p>THEY WERE ESTABLISHED TO DEFEND.  THUS THE SURVIVAL </p><p>OF THE REGIME REQUIRES THAT CIVILIANS--READ MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE RULING FAMILY--MAINTAIN TIGHT CONTROL OVER THE </p><p>MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT.  THE REGIME HAS PUT THIS </p><p>FAMILIAR  PRINCIPLE INTO PRACTICE BY ENSURING THAT </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS SIT FIRMLY AT THE APEX OF EVERY </p><p>MILITARY OR QUASI-MILITARY COMMAND PYRAMID--WHETHER </p><p>IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION (MODA), THE </p><p>NATIONAL GUARD, OR THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR. </p><p> </p><p>8.  GIVEN THESE SAME CONCERNS IT IS ALSO NOT </p><p>SURPRISING THAT, UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY, THE RULERS </p><p>OF SAUDI ARABIA DID VERY LITTLE TO IMPROVE THEIR </p><p>ARMED FORCES EITHER QUANTITATIVELY OR QUALITATIVELY. </p><p>THEY WERE CONTENT TO ALLOW THE ESTABLISHMENT OF </p><p>ONLY A MODEST MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION </p><p>(MODA) AND MAINTAINED ONLY AN ANTIQUATED NATIONAL </p><p>GUARD.  BUT THIS VIEW BEGAN TO CHANGE IN THE EARLY </p><p>SIXTIES.  IN THE FACE OF WHAT THEY VIEWED AS </p><p>NASSIRITE AGGRESSION FROM THE YEMEN, THE AL SAUD </p><p>WERE FORCED TO RECOGNIZE THE VULNERABILITY OF THEIR </p><p>OWN REGIME TO OUTSIDE MILITARY THREATS.  THEY BEGAN </p><p>A MODEST ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE THEIR DEFENSE FORCES </p><p>AND NATIONAL GUARD WHICH (WITH THE HELP OF NEW </p><p>OIL WEALTH) BECAME A MAJOR EFFORT TO EXPAND AND </p><p>UPGRADE ALL ELEMENTS OF THE MILITARY.  VAST BUILDING </p><p>PROJECTS AND THE ACQUISITION OF SOPHISTICATED </p><p>WEAPONRY HAVE BEEN A MAJOR SAG PREOCCUPATION FROM </p><p>1974 TO THE PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.   ALTHOUGH THERE WAS LIMITED SAUDI PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN FIGHTING IN THE GOLAN IN 1973, IT WAS THE WAR BETWEEN </p><p>IRAN AND IRAQ WHICH FORCED THE SAG TO COME TO TERMS </p><p>WITH SOME OF THE REALITIES OF MODERN COMBAT.  ALL THE </p><p>NEW EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD IS OF LITTLE VALUE WITHOUT </p><p>A COHESIVE OFFICER CORPS CAPABLE OF MAKING QUICK, </p><p>SOPHISTICATED USE OF THEIR WEAPONRY.  UNFORTUNATELY, </p><p>THIS IS PRECISELY THE SORT OF MILITARY ORGANIZATION </p><p>BEST SUITED, AND HENCE MORE LIKELY, TO SEEK POWER IN </p><p>ITS OWN RIGHT.  THE AL SAUD HAVE ACCEPTED THE NEED TO </p><p>DEVELOP THE COMMAND, CONTROL, COORDINATION AND STAFFING </p><p>MECHANISMS NEEDED TO OPERATE A MODERN MILITARY FORCE. </p><p>PEACE SHIELD, THE SAUDIS\' MULTIBILLION DOLLAR C3 PROGRAM </p><p>FOR AIR DEFENSE, MAY EVENTUALLY LINK THE AIR DEFENSE </p><p>COMMAND, RSAF AND ROYAL SAUDI NAVY, BUT THIS PROGRAM </p><p>DOES NOT BEGIN TO TACKLE THE QUESTION OF COMBINED ARMS </p><p>OPERATIONAL CONTROL.  IT ADDRESSES WHAT UNQUESTIONABLY </p><p>IS THE GREATEST CURRENT THREAT PERCEIVED BY THE SAUDI </p><p>REGIME, THAT OF AN AIR ATTACK AGAINST THEIR PETRO- </p><p>INDUSTRIAL-DESALINATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE </p><p>EASTERN PROVINCE.  HOWEVER, IMPLEMENTATION EVEN OF THIS </p><p>PROGRAM HAS BEEN SLOW AND A SYSTEM WHICH INTEGRATES </p><p>ALL THE MILITARY SERVICES, LET ALONE MODA AND THE SANG, </p><p>IS A LONG WAY OFF.  FURTHER STEPS FACILITIATING MILITARY </p><p>COORDINATION BETWEEN SERVICES AND ITS TRANSFER OUT OF THE </p><p>HANDS OF PRINCELY AUTHORITY AND INTO THOSE OF A MILITARY </p><p>GENERAL STAFF DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE IN THE CARDS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WARY THAT A STRONG, COHESIVE MILITARY MIGHT POSE </p><p>A THREAT TO THEIR RULE, THE AL SAUD TREAT EVERY BRANCH </p><p>OF THE MILITARY AS A SEPARATE ENTITY WITH ITS OWN </p><p>EQUIPMENT, GARRISON AND DISTINCT LINES OF COMMAND AND </p><p>CONTROL.  THUS THE ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE ARE HAMPERED </p><p>BY INCOMPATIBILITY OF COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT, SPARE </p><p>PARTS AND AMMUNITION AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, MUTUAL </p><p>DISTRUST SOMETIMES BORDERING ON DISDAIN.  THE NATIONAL </p><p>GUARD AND MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION HAVE BUT </p><p>LIMITED CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER, LITTLE CHANCE AT </p><p>INTEROPERABILITY, AND NO PROVISIONS FOR JOINT OPERATIONS </p><p>EXCEPT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE BROADEST MISSION </p><p>STATEMENTS.  ARMY FORCES ARE ALL GARRISONED WELL AWAY </p><p>FROM THE CAPITAL.  THE ONLY GROUND FORCES NEAR RIYADH </p><p>BELONG TO THE NATIONAL GUARD.  RIYADH AIRBASE HAS NO </p><p>FIGHTER SQUADRONS.  IT IS A FAIR ASSESSMENT TO SAY THAT </p><p>THE SAUDI REGIME HAS TRIED TO ACHIEVE A DELICATE BALANCE, </p><p>HAVING THE MILITARY CAPABILITY AND EFFICIENCY TO MEET </p><p>POTENTIAL EXTERNAL THREATS, BUT NOT SO MUCH AS TO </p><p>ENDANGER THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S OWN DOMESTIC POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>11.  BUT ARE THE PRINCES IN THE MILITARY AN ELEMENT </p><p>OF THE SAME CONTROL PROCESS?  DOES THEIR PRESENCE HAVE </p><p>AN IMPACT ON THE REGIME\'S SECURITY, ON THE EFFICIENCY </p><p>OF THE ARMED FORCES, ON MILITARY MORALE?  DO SENIOR </p><p>PRINCES WITH MINISTERIAL POSITIONS CAREFULLY PLACE THEIR </p><p>JUNIORS IN KEY, UNIFORMED JOBS?  THE COMPLEXITY OF </p><p>AL SAUD FAMILY POLITICS MAKES HIGHLY SPECULATIVE ANY </p><p>ATTEMPT TO INFER THE ORGANIZATION AND CONTROL THAT </p><p>WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PLACE OFFICERS INTO KEY POSITIONS </p><p>IN THE MILITARY SUITABLE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF A </p><p>WATCHDOG ROLE.  MOREOVER, FAR FROM BEING A MONOLITHIC </p><p>ORGANIZATION, THE AL SAUD FAMILY IS A SPRAWLING ENTITY </p><p>WITH AN ARRAY OF DISCRETE AND SOMETIMES COMPETITIVE </p><p>INTERESTS; COHESION AND INTERNAL CONTROL ARE A MAJOR </p><p>PREOCCUPATION OF THE SENIOR-MOST PRINCES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  UNQUESTIONABLY, THERE ARE REASONS WHY PRINCES </p><p>MIGHT PLAY A ROLE IN THE MILITARY BY DESIGN.  GIVEN </p><p>AN ABUNDANCE OF WELL-EDUCATED, LOYAL PRINCES, A </p><p>LOGICAL MOVE FOR THE AL SAUD TO MAKE WOULD BE TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE SOME OF THESE YOUNG MEN TO JOIN THE MILITARY. </p><p>SUCH MEN, IMBUED AS THEY ARE WITH A VESTED SELF- </p><p>INTEREST IN THE REGIME, COULD SERVE AS ITS EYES AND EARS </p><p>AND ALSO EXERT AN INFLUENCE ON THE REST OF THE OFFICER </p><p>CORPS.  CLEARLY THE TOP ECHELON OF THE SAG IS COMPOSED </p><p>ENTIRELY OF PRINCES.  KING FAHD BIN ABDUL AZIZ IS THE </p><p>SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES.  HE EXERCISES </p><p>CONTROL OVER THE REGULAR MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>THROUGH HIS FULL BROTHER, SULTAN BIN ABDUL AZIZ, </p><p>MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION.  WHILE THE KING IS </p><p>ALSO NOMINAL CHIEF OF THE SAUDI ARABIAN NATIONAL GUARD, </p><p>HIS HALF BROTHER, ABDULLAH BIN ABDUL AZIZ, IS ITS </p><p>COMMANDER.  THE KING WOULD PROBABLY HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY </p><p>IN EXERTING ARBITRARY AUTHORITY OVER ABDULLAH, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN MATTERS AFFECTING THE SANG.  DECISIONS </p><p>ARE OFTEN MADE WITH SENIOR FAMILY AGREEMENT.  SINCE </p><p>SURVIVAL OF THE REGIME IS THE AL SAUD FAMILY\'S FIRST </p><p>IMPERATIVE, THERE IS LITTLE VISIBLE SIGN OF DISHARMONY. </p><p>AS CROWN PRINCE AND THUS FAHD\'S PUTATIVE SUCCESSOR, </p><p>STABILITY OF THE REGIME IS ALSO VERY MUCH IN </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S PERSONAL INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>13.  MANY SEEMINGLY INFLUENTIAL POSITIONS BELOW THE </p><p>CIVILIAN POLITICAL DIRECTION LEVEL ARE HELD BY PRINCES. </p><p>UNTIL RECENTLY, THE DIRECTOR OF AIR  OPERATIONS </p><p>FOR THE RSAF WAS A PRINCE.  TWO OF THE FIGHTER BASE </p><p>COMMANDERS ARE PRINCES.  (A THIRD IS COMMANDED BY </p><p>AN AL-SUDAIRY, ONE OF THE FAMILIES LONG ASSOCIATED </p><p>WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY (SEE PARA 16).  WHILE OFTEN </p><p>ADDRESSED AS "PRINCE," AND CLEARLY POSSESSING </p><p>EXCELLENT ROYAL CONNECTIONS, EARLIER REPORTS OFFICIALLY </p><p>LABELING COL AHMED BIN MUSAID AL-SUDAIRY AS A PRINCE </p><p>WERE IN ERROR.)  A NUMBER OF THE MILITARY POLICE </p><p>LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE ARMY ARE HELD BY PRINCES </p><p>AS WELL.  THE DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE NAVY IS A PRINCE. </p><p>IN THE SANG, THE MOST POLITICIZED OF THE SERVICES, </p><p>WE FIND NOT ONLY THE TOP TWO POSITIONS HELD BY </p><p>CIVILIANS BUT ALSO CIVILIAN PRINCES IN KEY ROLES AS </p><p>THE SANG COMMANDERS IN THE WESTERN PROVINCE, </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S SON KHALID, THE EASTERN PROVINCE, MISHARI </p><p>BIN SAUD,AS WELL AS OTHERS IN MORE REMOVED FINANCIAL </p><p>AND ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  MOST PRINCES IN UNIFORM ARE OFFICERS IN THE RSAF </p><p>AND THE ARMY (SAUDI ARABIAN LAND FORCES, OR SALF), </p><p>THE TWO ELEMENTS OF THE ARMED FORCES MOST CAPABLE OF </p><p>MOUNTING A THREAT TO AL SAUD RULE.  PRINCES ARE MORE </p><p>COMMON IN THE OFFICER RANKS OF THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>THAN IN ALL THE OTHERS (NAVY, SANG, MOI QUASI- </p><p>MILITARY FORCES).  IF PRINCES ARE IN THE ARMED FORCES </p><p>TO FULFILL AN OVERSIGHT ROLE, THEY ARE CERTAINLY IN </p><p>THE RIGHT BRANCHES OF THE SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>15.  BUT IF THERE ARE THESE INDICATIONS SUPPORTING </p><p>THE CONCEPT OF DIRECTED ROYAL PLACEMENT IN THE </p><p>MILITARY, THERE IS MUCH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE </p><p>ALSO TENDING TO SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT THE PRESENCE </p><p>AND PLACEMENT OF PRINCES IN THE MILITARY REFLECTS </p><p>INDIVIDUAL INCLINATION AND AMBITION AS MUCH AS-- </p><p>OR MORE THAN--THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PUTATIVE </p><p>PROTECTION PLAN ELABORATED BY THE AL SAUD.  PRINCES </p><p>FREELY REFUSE ASSIGNMENTS AND APPEAR TO BE FREE TO </p><p>LEAVE THE SERVICE IF THEY DESIRE TO DO SO.  THE </p><p>AL SAUD LEADERSHIP APPEARS TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT </p><p>PUSHING PRINCES TOO FAR TOO FAST AS WELL.  PROMOTIONS </p><p>INTO THE GENERAL OFFICER RANKS HAVE ONLY RECENTLY </p><p>BEEN MADE.  BREAKING THE PROMOTION ICE WAS </p><p>COL. FAHD B. ABDULLAH, FORMER RSAF DIRECTOR OF </p><p>AIR OPERATIONS, WHO BECAME SAUDI ARABIA\'S FIRST </p><p>PRINCE TO BE PROMOTED THROUGH THE OFFICER RANKS TO </p><p>BRIGADIER GENERAL IN JANUARY 1984.  THIS PROMOTION </p><p>WAS LATER FOLLOWED BY THE PROMOTIONS OF COL. FAYSAL B. </p><p>MUHAMMED, SALF AVIATION CHIEF, AND KHALID B. SULTAN, </p><p>DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE RSADF. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THERE IS ALSO A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ROYAL </p><p>CONTROL IS REALLY FURTHERED THROUGH A PRINCELY </p><p>PRESENCE.  ABDUL AZIZ FATHERED 45 ACKNOWLEDGED SONS </p><p>FROM AT LEAST 22 WIVES.  THE SURVIVORS AMONG THESE </p><p>SONS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR OWN OFFSPRING, HAVE, OVER </p><p>THE YEARS, ESTABLISHED INFORMAL BLOCKS COMPOSED </p><p>GENERALLY OF GROUPINGS OF FULL-BROTHERS BUT ALSO </p><p>INCLUDING HALF-BROTHER ALLIES.  TO THESE MUST BE </p><p>ADDED THE SONS OF ABDUL AZIZ\'S RELATIVES WHOSE </p><p>FAMILIES CONSTITUTE THE AL SAUD CADET BRANCHES, </p><p>AND THE CHILDREN OF LONG TIME ASSOCIATES NOW </p><p>MARRIED INTO THE GREATER FAMILY.  THESE LATTER </p><p>GROUPS ARE IN AN AMBIGUOUS, AMBIVALENT POSITION: </p><p>WHILE MANY AL SHAYKH AND AL SUDAIRY DAUGHTERS CONTINUE </p><p>TO MARRY YOUNG SCIONS OF THE AL SAUD, MALE MEMBERS </p><p>OF THESE FAMILIES OFTEN EXHIBIT--AND SOMETIMES ARE </p><p>REMINDED BY THE AL SAUD--THAT THEIR LINEAGE IS </p><p>DISTANT.  THIS DIVERSIFICATION OF FAMILY GROUPINGS, </p><p>WITH THEIR CONCOMITANT LOYALTIES, COMPLICATES THE </p><p>ROYAL PRESENCE IN THE ARMED FORCES AND REFLECTS AMONG </p><p>THE UNIFORMED PRINCES A DIVERSITY OF ROLES, INTERESTS </p><p>AND ASPIRATIONS.  THIS DIVERSITY IMPOSES LIMITS TO THE </p><p>DEGREE OF CONTROL AVAILABLE TO THE SENIOR PRINCES </p><p>THROUGH THE PRESENCE OF PRINCES IN THE MILITARY. </p><p>IT IS SIMILARLY FLAWED EVEN AS AN INFORMATION/ </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CONDUIT.  OFFICER PRINCES ARE OFTEN </p><p>ABLE TO AVOID SUBJUGATING THEIR PERSONAL GOALS AND </p><p>AMBITIONS TO THE DESIRES OF THEIR MORE REMOVED UNCLES </p><p>AND COUSINS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  CONTROL AMONG THE SENIOR PRINCES IS COMPLICATED </p><p>ENOUGH (SEE PARA 12).  IT IS EVEN MORE SO AMONG </p><p>THE JUNIORS.  THE PRINCES ALL APPEAR TO BE LOYAL </p><p>TO THE REGIME.  WHILE THERE MAY BE A VARIETY OF </p><p>DIFFERENT SELF-INTERESTS AMONG THEM, ALL THE PRINCES </p><p>ARE DEPENDENT ON THE MONARCHY FOR THEIR STATION IN </p><p>LIFE.  COMPLICATIONS BEGIN WHEN WE EXAMINE THE </p><p>MAKEUP OF THE ROYAL FAMILY AND SEE THAT WHILE MANY </p><p>BEAR THE TITLE OF PRINCE, ALL PRINCES ARE NOT EQUAL. </p><p>THIS LACK OF EQUALITY OFTEN BRINGS WITH IT A WIDE </p><p>RANGE OF PRIORITIES IN LIFE.  SOME PRINCES, MOSTLY </p><p>FROM THE MORE DISTANT BRANCHES OF THE  FAMILY, </p><p>ARE LESS CONCERNED WITH POWER POLITICS AND MORE </p><p>WITH JUST PLAIN UPWARD MOBILITY.  UNABLE TO ASPIRE </p><p>TO THE HIGHEST OFFICES IN THE LAND, THESE PRINCES </p><p>HOLD A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER ASPIRATIONS AND </p><p>AMBITIONS.  FIRST PRIORITY FOR THESE MEN CAN BE </p><p>THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, </p><p>THE SECURING OF A CONTRACT, THE PURCHASE OF NEW </p><p>EQUIPMENT OR THE OPENING OF A NEW BRANCH OFFICE, </p><p>JUST AS MUCH AS THE SECURING OF A MILITARY PROMOTION </p><p>OR NEW, BETTER POSITION.  THE REGIME APPEARS TO BE </p><p>FAIRLY TOLERANT OF THIS ATTITUDE. </p><p> </p><p>18.  IN SUM, WE CAN SAY THAT AT THE VERY TOP OF THE </p><p>CHAIN OF COMMAND--THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL--PRINCES </p><p>HAVE BEEN GIVEN ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES AND OPERATE THOSE FORCES VERY MUCH WITH </p><p>THE SURVIVAL OF SAUDI ARABIA AND THE REGIME IN MIND. </p><p>AS WE GO FARTHER DOWN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND, WE FIND </p><p>A NUMBER OF PRINCES WHOSE REASON FOR BEING THERE IS </p><p>MUCH MORE OBSCURE.  HOWEVER, IF  THEY ARE NOT </p><p>SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF TIME LOOKING AFTER THE </p><p>INTERESTS  OF THE REGIME, THEY AT LEAST GIVE </p><p>OUTSIDERS THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY MIGHT BE.  THUS </p><p>THE REGIME PROBABLY PROFITS MORE FROM THE PERCEPTION </p><p>THAN THE REALITY, AND MORE SO AMONG THE EXPATRIATE </p><p>COMMUNITY THAN INSIDERS.  ALTHOUGH SOME PRINCES ARE </p><p>IN POSITIONS FROM WHERE THEY CAN OVERSEE THE GOINGS </p><p>ON IN THE MILITARY, THERE ARE ENOUGH </p><p>KEY POSITIONS FILLED BY COMMONERS AND, SIMILARLY, </p><p>ENOUGH POSITIONS FILLED BY PRINCES WHERE THERE IS </p><p>RELATIVELY LITTLE CONTROL OR OVERSIGHT TO CAST </p><p>DOUBT THAT THE AL SAUD MAKE ANYTHING MORE THAN A </p><p>HALF-HEARTED ATTEMPT TO POSITION THEIR TRUSTED SONS </p><p>IN KEY JOBS.  SELECTIONS APPEAR  TO BE BASED ON </p><p>THE PRINCES\' INDIVIDUAL DESIRES, AND THE AVAILABILITY </p><p>OF POSITIONS AT A GIVEN TIME. </p><p> </p><p>19.  IF PRINCES ARE NOT IN THE MILITARY TO ACT PRIMARILY </p><p>AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REGIME, WHY THEN ARE THEY </p><p>THERE?  FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE NOT MANY JOBS THAT A </p><p>PRINCE WILL ACCEPT.  WHILE SOME OF THE OLDER, MORE </p><p>RETIRING PRINCES ARE CONTENT WITH THE WORLD OF </p><p>BUSINESS AND FINANCE, THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH MANY </p><p>OF THE YOUNGER, WESTERN EDUCATED AND MORE WORLDLY </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY.  FOR SOME, THERE IS SIMPLY </p><p>NO MOTIVATION TO SPEND LONG HOURS TENDING AFTER </p><p>FAMILY BUSINESS INTERESTS.  FOR OTHERS, DEALING </p><p>DIRECTLY IN BUSINESS IS DEMEANING.  FOR STILL OTHERS, </p><p>THERE IS A YEARNING FOR BIGGER, MORE IMPORTANT TASKS. </p><p> </p><p>20.  THROUGHOUT HISTORY, MILITARY SERVICE HAS BEEN AN </p><p>ACCEPTABLE OCCUPATION FOR MEMBERS OF THE NOBILITY. </p><p>DEFENSE OF THE FAITH AND THE NATION, HONOR AND </p><p>GLORY, PRIDE AND ALL THE OTHER MANIFESTATIONS OF </p><p>MILITARY SERVICE PERMIT PRINCES TO JOIN THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES ALONG WITH THEIR COMMONER COUNTRYMEN.  WHILE </p><p>THE PREPONDERANCE OF PRINCES ARE IN THE SALF AND RSAF, </p><p>THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY THIS SHOULD BE THE </p><p>CASE.  IN A COUNTRY WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF EXCITING </p><p>DIVERSIONS, FLYING AN F-15 OR AN F-5 WITH THE </p><p>POTENTIAL OF ENGAGING IN AERIAL COMBAT IS VERY </p><p>STIMULATING.  VIRTUALLY ALL THE PRINCES IN THE RSAF </p><p>ARE PILOTS.  TWO FIGHTER BASES ARE COMMANDED BY </p><p>PRINCES.  THEIR ACCESS TO THE BEST EDUCATION, THEIR </p><p>LEADERSHIP ADVANTAGES AND THE BASIC ABILITY OF MANY </p><p>OF THE RSAF PRINCES ALL MAKE THEIR APPOINTMENT TO </p><p>LEADERSHIP POSITIONS A LOGICAL OUTCOME OF SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>21. SERVICE IN THE LAND FORCES GROWS OUT OF A LONG </p><p>TRADITION OF GROUND COMBAT.  THE VIEW AMONG THE </p><p>BEDOUIN OF SAUDI ARABIA IS THAT SERVICE IN THE "GROUND </p><p>GAINING ARMS" OF THE MILITARY, WHETHER FOR DEFENSE, </p><p>OR IN OLDER TIMES FOR THE HONOR IT WAS POSSIBLE TO </p><p>ACQUIRE IN THE ONCE PERENNIAL RAIDING, IS THE MOST </p><p>HONORED FORM OF MILITARY SERVICE.  IF MANY OF THE MORE </p><p>EDUCATED, COSMOPOLITAN SAUDIS, PRINCES AND COMMONERS, </p><p>ARE FINDING THE OTHER BRANCHES OF SERVICE--AIR FORCE, </p><p>NAVY AND AIR DEFENSE--EQUALLY ATTRACTIVE, FAMILY AND </p><p>SOCIAL PRESSURE STILL FORCE  MANY OF THOSE WHO DO </p><p>ENTER MILITARY SERVICE TO ENTER THE LAND FORCES AND </p><p>SANG.  RELUCTANT AS SOME MAY BE TO JOIN, SERVICE IN </p><p>THE SANG CAN AMOUNT TO A FAMILY OBLIGATION FOR FAVORS </p><p>GIVEN OR EXPECTED IN THE FUTURE.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>SANG OFFICERS AUTOMATICALLY INCUR A DEBT OF LOYALTY </p><p>TO CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH.  THIS REQUIREMENT PROBABLY </p><p>KEEPS PRINCES WHOSE FAMILY LOYALTIES ARE TO OTHER </p><p>SECTORS OF THE FAMILY, OUT OF THE SANG. </p><p> </p><p>22.  JOINING THE ARMED FORCES CARRIES WITH IT A NUMBER </p><p>OF OBVIOUS BENEFITS.  A NUMBER OF PRINCES HAVE USED </p><p>MILITARY SERVICE TO ESTABLISH THEIR CREDENTIALS AS </p><p>CAPABLE LEADERS AND HAVE GONE ON TO OTHER CAREERS </p><p>IN GOVERNMENT.  OTHERS SEEM INCLINED TO GO FROM THE </p><p>MILITARY INTO BUSINESS HAVING MADE LUCRATIVE CONTACTS </p><p>OR BEGUN THEIR FORTUNES IN OTHER WAYS WHILE IN THE </p><p>SERVICE.  OTHERS STAY IN THE SERVICE BALANCING MILITARY </p><p>DUTY WITH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.  HOWEVER, ONE FACT STANDS </p><p>OUT ABOVE ALL THE REST--MILITARY SERVICE IS NO BAR </p><p>TO GETTING WEALTHY.  MANY OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN </p><p>HAVE AMASSED GREAT FORTUNES THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF </p><p>MILITARY SERVICE.  UNTIL RECENTLY, MODA WAS A SEEMINGLY </p><p>INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF CONTRACTS, PROJECTS, PROCUREMENT </p><p>ACTIONS AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.  WITH NO ENFORCEMENT </p><p>OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST LAWS AGAINST PRINCES, MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE MILITARY, TOGETHER WITH THEIR CIVILIAN RELATIVES, </p><p>TAPPED THIS VAST RESERVE OF FUNDS.  FOR PRINCES, THE </p><p>INSIDE TRACK PROVIDED BY THEIR FAMILY CONNECTION </p><p>HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OUTSHINE ALL THEIR </p><p>NON-ROYAL COLLEAGUES.  THE HIGHER IN RANK, THE BIGGER </p><p>THE OPPORTUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>23.  SOME OFFICERS, SUCH AS COL TURKI BIN NASSIR, </p><p>BASE COMMANDER AT DHAHRAN AND SON OF NASSIR BIN </p><p>ABDUL AZIZ, HAVE MADE NO SECRET OF THEIR BUSINESS </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  AMONG HIS INTERESTS ARE SEVERAL </p><p>BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE F-15 SQUADRON COMMANDER LTC </p><p>MANSOUR BIN BANDAR, ANOTHER PRINCE, IS HIS PARTNER. </p><p>OTHER PRINCES, SUCH AS THE FORMER RSAF DIRECTOR </p><p>OF AIR OPERATIONS, BG FAHD BIN ABDULLAH BIN MUHAMMED </p><p>BIN SAUD AL KABIR, AND HIS YOUNGER UNCLE, BG FAYSAL </p><p>BIN MUHAMMED BIN SAUD AL KABIR, CONDUCT BUSINESS </p><p>THROUGH RELATIVES OR OTHER SURROGATES OUTSIDE THE </p><p>MILITARY.  WHILE FAYSAL, HEAD OF ARMY AVIATION, </p><p>APPEARS TO OWN ONLY A TRAFFIC  LIGHT COMPANY, </p><p>IN REALITY HE IS TIED THROUGH HIS BROTHERS INTO </p><p>MANY ESTABLISHMENTS DIRECTLY RELATED NOT ONLY TO </p><p>ARMY AVIATION BUT ALSO OTHER MILITARY AREAS FROM </p><p>WHICH HE TOO IS PROFITING.  LTC MANSOUR BIN BANDAR, </p><p>THE COMMANDER OF THE F-15 SQUADRON AT THE DHAHRAN </p><p>AIR BASE, RECENTLY DECLINED A TRANSFER WHICH WOULD </p><p>HAVE MADE HIM BASE COMMANDER IN TAIF.  THE REPORTED </p><p>REASON FOR THIS REFUSAL WAS THE REQUIREMENT TO </p><p>GIVE UP PERSONAL CONTROL OF HIS BUSINESS OPERATIONS </p><p>IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>24.  MINDEF SULTAN\'S SON, BG KHALID BIN SULTAN, IS </p><p>THE DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE ROYAL SAUDI AIR DEFENSE </p><p>FORCES.  IN HIS ROLE AS DEPUTY COMMANDER, KHALID </p><p>HAS PROFITED SMARTLY FROM THE VARIOUS WEAPONS </p><p>DEALS HE HAS HELPED ENGINEER.  REPORTEDLY, BOTH </p><p>KHALID AND HIS FATHER OBTAINED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS </p><p>OF DOLLARS IN THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED DEAL TO PURCHASE </p><p>SHAHINE MISSILES FROM THE FRENCH.  OTHER PRINCES </p><p>HAVE PROFITED BY WRITING THE SPECIFICATIONS NEEDED </p><p>FOR A PARTICULAR WEAPON OR SERVICE TO FIT A PARTICULAR </p><p>COMPANY\'S OFFER OR THE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR </p><p>COMPETITIVE RUNOFFS.  OFTEN, AS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE </p><p>CASE OF A LARGE FOOD SERVICE COMPANY SUPPORTING MODA, </p><p>THE OWNER CAN BESTOW THE CONTRACT ON HIMSELF, IN THIS </p><p>CASE, VICE DEFENSE MINISTER ABDUL RAHMAN.  INSIDE </p><p>TRADING IS A COMMON PRACTICE.  SINCE THERE ARE NO </p><p>CONFLICT OF INTEREST WORRIES, THE PRINCES OFTEN ACT </p><p>WITH IMPUNITY.  A NUMBER OF PRINCES ARE MANEUVERING </p><p>ACTIVELY FOR A PIECE OF THE PEACE SHIELD OFFSET </p><p>PACKAGE.  SOME HAVE ARRANGED THE PLACEMENT OF PERSONAL </p><p>EMPLOYEES WITH COMPANIES THEY THOUGHT WOULD GET A </p><p>PIECE OF THE ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>25.  DESPITE AL SAUD PREOCCUPATION WITH IT, MONEY </p><p>IS NOT THE ONLY ATTRACTION FOUND IN MILITARY SERVICE. </p><p>WHILE SOME PRINCES DEVOTE THEMSELVES ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY </p><p>TO SELF ENRICHMENT, AND OTHERS, LIKE THE SAUD AL KABIR, </p><p>CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH MONEY AS A HANDSOME SIDELINE </p><p>TO THEIR MILITARY CAREERS, OTHERS HAVE HIGHER </p><p>ASPIRATIONS.  THE MILITARY CAN BE A STEPPING STONE </p><p>TO BIGGER THINGS.  IT IS CLEARLY NOT A DISADVANTAGE. </p><p>AMONG THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLES ARE THAT OF BANDAR </p><p>BIN SULTAN, ANOTHER SON OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE, </p><p>AND MITIEB BIN ABDULLAH, SON OF THE CROWN PRINCE. </p><p>BANDAR WAS DOUBTLESS A BUSINESSMAN WHEN HE WAS IN </p><p>UNIFORM.  FOR THAT MATTER, HE STILL IS INVOLVED </p><p>IN BUSINESSES HE HAD WHEN F-15 COMMANDER IN DHAHRAN. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE IS ALSO A VERY AMBITIOUS MAN WHO ASPIRES </p><p>TO DOING GREAT THINGS FOR HIS COUNTRY.  BANDAR WAS </p><p>QUICK TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED BY THE ARMS </p><p>SALE DEBATE IN THE U.S. IN THE EARLY 80\'S.  HE </p><p>QUICKLY BECAME AN ARTICULATE SPOKESMAN FOR HIS </p><p>COUNTRY\'S MILITARY POLICY NEEDS.  HIS FAMILY </p><p>CREDENTIALS AND POLITICAL ACUMEN ENABLED HIM TO </p><p>GAIN ACCESS TO THE KING\'S EAR AND HIS PERSONAL </p><p>CHARM AND ABILITY EARNED HIM THE KING\'S ATTENTION. </p><p>NOW AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES AND SOMETIMES </p><p>MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR FOR THE KING, BANDAR IS RUMORED </p><p>TO BE HEADING FOR AN EVEN LARGER FOREIGN POLICY ROLE. </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S SON, MITIEB, IS ALSO A VERY AMBITIOUS MAN. </p><p>USING HIS POSITION AS SON OF THE SANG COMMANDER, MITIEB </p><p>HAS QUICKLY RISEN IN RANK, FAR FASTER THAN ANYONE ELSE </p><p>IN THE ORGANIZATION.  HE ANSWERS ONLY TO HIS FATHER </p><p>AND PERHAPS HIS FATHER\'S MOST SENIOR ADVISOR.  MITIEB </p><p>IS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE MILITARY LIFE, HOWEVER. </p><p>REPORTEDLY, HE IS ANXIOUS FOR A ROLE SIMILAR TO THAT </p><p>OF BANDAR.  IF AND WHEN HIS FATHER BECOMES KING, </p><p>MITIEB MAY WELL GET HIS WISH.  SOME OTHERS WHO HAVE </p><p>MOVED ON ARE LISTED IN LAST SECTION OF LIST PROVIDED </p><p>IN PARA 4.  THE VERY FACT THAT A NUMBER OF PRINCES </p><p>HAVE MOVED ON FROM APPARENTLY SUCCESSFUL MILITARY </p><p>CAREERS TENDS TO FAVOR THE VIEW THAT THE ROYAL </p><p>FAMILY IS NOT THAT CONCERNED WITH THE PRINCELY </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>26.  REGARDLESS OF THEIR REASON FOR BEING THERE, </p><p>THE FINAL KEY QUESTION IS: WHAT IMPACT DOES THE </p><p>ROYAL CONNECTION HAVE ON THE ARMED FORCES?  COMMAND </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PRINCES AND THEIR COMMONER </p><p>COLLEAGUES ARE ESTABLISHED BY PRINCE SULTAN AND </p><p>PRINCE ABDULLAH.  IN THE SANG, NONE OF THE PRINCES </p><p>APPEAR TO ANSWER TO ANYONE BUT THE CROWN PRINCE OR </p><p>HIS MOST SENIOR DEPUTY.  HOWEVER, THE SANG IS SMALL, </p><p>IS MORE ABDULLAH\'S PRIVATE DOMAIN, AND ITS UNIQUE </p><p>TRIBAL ORIENTATION MAKES THE PLACE OF PRINCES </p><p>(ESPECIALLY PRINCES RELATED TO ABDULLAH) MORE </p><p>SECURE.  IN MODA, PRINCES ARE USUALLY IN A POSITION </p><p>TO TAKE ORDERS FROM COMMONERS.  OFFICIAL POLICY </p><p>SAYS THEY ARE TO BE TREATED ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK. </p><p>BUT THE REAL RELATIONSHIP IS UNCLEAR.  A PRINCE </p><p>HAS DIRECT ACCESS TO THE TOP, EITHER PERSONALLY OR </p><p>THROUGH HIS FAMILY.  THE HIGHER THE PRINCE, THE </p><p>EASIER IT IS FOR HIM TO GET HIS OWN WAY IN A DISPUTE. </p><p>WE DO NOT HEAR, HOWEVER, OF MANY DISPUTES WHICH </p><p>REQUIRE ROYAL SETTLEMENT FROM ABOVE.  WE KNOW OF </p><p>RIVALRIES BUT NOT OPEN INSUBORDINATION.  IT IS </p><p>PROBABLE THAT ANY PRINCE WHO CANNOT GET ALONG IN </p><p>MODA IS QUIETLY MOVED OUT.  WHILE STORIES ABOUND </p><p>AS TO THE ACTUAL REASON, BG FAHD BIN ABDULLAH\'S </p><p>RECENT RETIREMENT WAS REPORTEDLY DUE IN PART TO </p><p>THE PERSONAL POWER HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER RECENT </p><p>YEARS, POWER WHICH SOMETIMES APPEARED TO EXCEED THAT </p><p>OF HIS NOMINAL BOSS, THE RSAF COMMANDER.  (WHETHER </p><p>OR NOT THIS PROMPTED HIS PROMOTION/REMOVAL IS UNCLEAR. </p><p>MOST OBSERVERS AGREE HIS COMING IS AT LEAST A BENEFIT </p><p>TO CIVIL AVIATION AND A TECHNICAL PROMOTION.) </p><p> </p><p>27.  BUT TIGHT MILITARY DISCIPLINE IS NOT REALLY IN </p><p>THE SAUDI TRADITION--FOR COMMONERS AS WELL AS ROYALTY. </p><p>SAUDI SOCIETY REMAINS CLOSE TO THE STRONG BEDOUIN </p><p>ETHIC OF FIERCE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE AND STRONG, </p><p>FAMILY/CLAN ORIENTED LOYALTY.  WHILE NOT OBVIOUS, </p><p>EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING HAS ITS PLACE IN THE ORDER </p><p>OF IMPORTANCE.  LOYALTY IS FIRST TO ONE\'S FATHER </p><p>AND THEN TO A LESSER DEGREE, TO OTHER PERSONS, </p><p>INSTITUTIONS AND PURSUITS.  IN THE ARMED FORCES, </p><p>THIS HAS RESULTED IN THE REDUCTION OF WHAT ARE </p><p>ELSEWHERE STRICT MILITARY REGULATIONS INTO THE </p><p>LEAST RESTRICTIVE, LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. </p><p>WESTERN CONCEPTS OF MILILARY DISCIPLINE AS APPLIED </p><p>IN THE SAUDI ARABIAN ARMED FORCES ARE LIBERAL, </p><p>AND TO OUTSIDERS OFTEN SEEM PATENTLY INEFFECTIVE. </p><p>SOLDIERS ON GUARD DUTY CAN BE SEEN WITHOUT LACES </p><p>IN THEIR SHOES OR OUT OF PROPER UNIFORM IN SOME </p><p>OTHER WAY.  ALTHOUGH FORBIDDEN BY REGULATIONS, </p><p>SOLDIERS AND SAILORS CAN STILL BE SEEN LEAVING </p><p>THEIR OFFICES AT 2:00 PM (DAY\'S END) AND GETTING </p><p>INTO  THEIR TAXI CABS TO BEGIN A SECOND OCCUPATION. </p><p> </p><p>28.  DESPITE OFFICIAL PRONOUNCEMENTS TO THE CONTRARY, </p><p>WITH NO EQUALITY BETWEEN PRINCES AND OFFICERS OF EQUAL </p><p>RANK, LARGE DISPARITY IN PAY AND ALLOWANCES (PRINCES </p><p>GET A ROYAL STIPEND OF AROUND USD 120,000 PER YEAR, </p><p>DEPENDING ON PLACE IN THE FAMILY), AND A VAST ARRAY </p><p>OF PREREQUISITES SUCH AS FREE USE OF GOVERNMENT OWNED </p><p>AIRCRAFT, HOMES, ETC., IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THEY </p><p>ARE RELATIVELY ISOLATED FROM THEIR COMMONER COLLEAGUES </p><p>WITHIN THE MILITARY.  PRINCES ASSOCIATE VERY LITTLE </p><p>OUTSIDE THEIR OWN CIRCLES, BUT THIS INDEED IS THE </p><p>CASE WITH FAMILIES IN THE REST OF SAUDI SOCIETY. </p><p>HOWEVER, WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE ARMED FORCES IS THAT </p><p>THE BONDS OF COMRADESHIP ARE VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT. </p><p>WHILE PRINCES HAVE, THROUGH THEIR PERSONAL CONNECTIONS, </p><p>THE ABILITY TO EXERT PRESSURE ON BEHALF OF THEIR UNITS, </p><p>INFLUENCE IS THE WAY VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IS MOVED IN </p><p>THE SAUDI BUREAUCRACY AND NOT MUCH CREDIT IS GIVEN FOR </p><p>DOING SOMETHING WHICH IS EXPECTED.  THE PRESENCE OF A </p><p>PRINCE IN THE UNIT IS THEREFORE NOT NECESSARILY A </p><p>BOON TO MORALE. </p><p> </p><p>29.  THE MISSION IS AWARE OF COMPLAINTS AMONG COMMONER </p><p>OFFICERS ABOUT THE OBVIOUS PRIVILEGES AND EXCESSIVE </p><p>GREED OF ROYAL FAMILY MEMBERS.  THERE HAS ALSO BEEN </p><p>QUIET GRUMBLING ABOUT EXCESSIVE ADVANCEMENT, SUCH AS </p><p>IN THE CASE OF CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S SON MITIEB. </p><p>WHILE OFFICERS WILL MOST GENERALLY WITHHOLD THEIR </p><p>COMMENTS FROM FOREIGNERS, THE FACT THAT A FEW HAVE </p><p>BEEN WILLING TO SPEAK IS PROBABLY INDICATIVE OF WIDER, </p><p>PRIVATE ATTITUDES IN THE OFFICER CORPS.  (THERE IS </p><p>NO PROVISION FOR COMPLAINTS SUCH AS THESE AND THEREFORE, </p><p>IF THEY ARE WIDESPREAD, THEY ARE PROBABLY VOICED ONLY </p><p>AMONG CONFIDANTS.  WE KNOW OF CASES IN WHICH OFFICERS </p><p>WITH OUTSPOKEN OPINIONS HAVE BEEN MOVED TO ATTACHE </p><p>POSITIONS OUT OF THE COUNTRY, BEEN GIVEN RETIREMENT, </p><p>OR BEEN SECONDED TO NON-MILITARY, GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.)  PERHAPS THE EVIDENCE OF CAUTION </p><p>OF MOVING PRINCES TO THE MOST SENIOR POSITIONS </p><p>INDICATES SOME ROYAL FAMILY AWARENESS OF THE POTENTIAL </p><p>PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF OFFICER CORPS MORALE IF THEIR </p><p>OWN ARE PUSHED TOO FAR.  THE SANG APPEARS TO BE LESS </p><p>AFFECTED THAN MODA AND MORE RELAXED ABOUT THE PRINCELY </p><p>ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>30.  OVERALL, PRINCES DO NOT APPEAR TO HELP OR HARM </p><p>THE CAPABILITY OF THE ARMED FORCES.  WHILE IT IS </p><p>DEBATABLE HOW MUCH THEIR EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES </p><p>AFFECT MORALE, THEIR ABILITY TO  CUT THROUGH RED </p><p>TAPE AND FACILITATE MATTERS ON BEHALF OF THEIR UNITS </p><p>SHOULD HELP OFFSET AT LEAST ANY NEGATIVE FEELINGS. </p><p>WHILE SOME MAY COME IN FOR CRITICISM, THE PROVEN </p><p>ABILITY OF OTHERS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN RECOGNIZED AND </p><p>LEADERS SUCH AS COL. MITIEB, OVERALL, ARE RESPECTED </p><p>BY THEIR COLLEAGUES AND SUBORDINATES.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>FINANCIAL ADVANTAGES WHICH ONCE FELL TO EVERYONE </p><p>WITH A LITTLE IMAGINATION ARE DWINDLING FAST.  SOON, </p><p>THE CASE MAY BE THAT ONLY PRINCES WILL HAVE THE CLOUT, </p><p>ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND OPERATING LATITUDE TO MAKE </p><p>IT RICH.  IF THIS OCCURS, THEIR PLACE IN THE MILITARY </p><p>MAY BECOME MORE CONTROVERSIAL. </p><p> </p><p>31.  THE MERE PRESENCE OF PRINCES IN THE ARMED FORCES </p><p>PROVIDES SOME DEGREE OF STABILITY TO THE AL SAUD </p><p>REGIME.  REGARDLESS OF THEIR MOTIVES IN ENTERING </p><p>THE MILITARY, THEIR OVERSIGHT CAPABILITY AND </p><p>INFLUENCE ON EVENTS IN THE MILITARY MUST INEVITABLY </p><p>HAVE SOME EFFECT ON UNIT PERSONNEL.  AND INEVITABLY, </p><p>EVEN IF LINKS TO THE SENIOR PRINCES ARE WEAK, THERE </p><p>MUST BE SOME FEEDBACK ON MILITARY ATTITUDES FROM </p><p>THE PRINCELY PRESENCE.  WHETHER OR NOT A PRINCE </p><p>IMPROVES OR DETRACTS FROM THE MORALE OR CAPABILITY </p><p>OF HIS UNIT IS MORE OR LESS DEPENDENT ON HIS ATTITUDE </p><p>TOWARD THE PROFESSION AND HIS PERSONAL INTERESTS. </p><p>HOWEVER, HIS PRIMARY BENEFIT TO THE REGIME, WHETHER </p><p>BY DESIGN OR NOT, IS THE ROYAL PRESENCE HIS ASSIGNMENT </p><p>BRINGS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUDDARTH </p><p></p></div>
