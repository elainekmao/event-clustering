<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 004046 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  06/29/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, XF, KU </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE RIFT BETWEEN THE CROWN PRINCE AND FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>REF:  KUWAIT 3753 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY DCM GEORGIA DEBELL, REASON 1.5(B). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  KUWAITI FOREIGN MINISTER SHAYKH SABAH AL-AHMED AL-JABER </p><p>AL-SABAH REMAINS IN MOROCCO FOLLOWING HIS CONFRONTATION WITH THE </p><p>CROWN PRINCE ON THE EVE OF THE CAIRO SUMMIT (REFTEL).  SHAYKH </p><p>SABAH HAS CONTINUED TO PERFORM THE RITUALS OF THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER, AND HAS BEEN FEATURED IN THE LOCAL PRESS DISPATCHING </p><p>NATIONAL DAY GREETINGS AND CALLING ON MOROCCAN OFFICIALS </p><p>INCLUDING KING HASSAN.  HIS MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE TO SECRETARY </p><p>CHRISTOPHER AFTER THE DHAHRAN BOMBING RECEIVED SPECIAL ATTENTION, </p><p>AND WHILE THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A ROUTINE VACATION, IT IS EQUALLY </p><p>CLEAR THAT SHAYKH SABAH WILL BE COMING BACK TO THE FOLD.  THAT </p><p>MAY BE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S CHIEF OF </p><p>PROTOCOL TOLD US JUNE 29 THAT THE AMIR HAD GIVEN HIM TWO WEEKS TO </p><p>COOL OFF, AND HE IS EXPECTED BACK IN KUWAIT THE END OF THIS WEEK </p><p>OR THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  WHILE SHAYKH SABAH MAY SOON BE BACK ON THE JOB, THE RIFT </p><p>BETWEEN KUWAIT\'S SECOND AND THIRD RANKING OFFICIALS WILL </p><p>CONTINUE, AND MAY BE MORE PRONOUNCED.  INFORMATION MINISTER SAUD </p><p>NASIR, A BITTER CRITIC OF THE FOREIGN MINISTER (AND A </p><p>CORRESPONDINGLY CLOSE ALLY OF THE CROWN PRINCE), JOINED KUWAIT\'S </p><p>DELEGATION TO THE CAIRO SUMMIT AFTER SHAYKH SABAH DECAMPED, AND </p><p>WILL USE THE EPISODE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO </p><p>ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO TAKE ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  AS NOTED REFTEL, WHILE THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THIS </p><p>LATEST FLARE UP WAS THE ONGOING FEUD OVER RELATIONS WITH JORDAN, </p><p>THE TENSION BETWEEN THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND CROWN PRINCE IS </p><p>ROOTED IN FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES IN PERSONALITY AND STYLE.  THE </p><p>DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF OF KUWAIT\'S ARMED FORCES, FAHED AL-AMIR (A </p><p>SUPPORTER OF SHAYKH SABAH AND A RELATIVE BY MARRIAGE) TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR RECENTLY THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTER IS INCREASINGLY </p><p>FRUSTRATED WITH THE CROWN PRINCE\'S DECISION MAKING STYLE WHICH HE </p><p>DESCRIBED AS THE CAPACITY TO AVOID MAKING DECISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  WE SUSPECT THAT TIME AND AGE HAVE ALSO SHARPENED THE </p><p>RIVALRY FROM THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S SIDE.  AT 66, HE IS A YEAR </p><p>YOUNGER THAN THE AMIR AND A YEAR OLDER THAN THE CROWN PRINCE, AND </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE WILL NEVER RUN THE GOVERNMENT (LET ALONE </p><p>THE STATE) MAY BE INCREASINGLY APPARENT TO HIM.  WHATEVER THE </p><p>REASONS FOR THE DIVISION, THE FACT THAT IT IS A VERY PUBLIC ONE </p><p>MAKES KUWAITIS NERVOUS.  FAHED AL-AMIR AND PARLIAMENTARY FOREIGN </p><p>RELATIONS CHAIRMAN JASSIM AL-SAGER COMMENTED SEPARATELY TO THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER ALL THE WAY AROUND IF THE </p><p>SENIOR AL-SABAHS COULD KEEP THEIR DIFFERENCES TO THEMSELVES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY DURING SUCH CHALLENGING TIMES IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CROCKER </p><p></p></div>
