<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002455 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Govt Postpones Tsvangirai Treason Trial </p><p> </p><p>REF: Harare 2120 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Zimbabwe\'s High Court has put off the </p><p>trial of opposition Movement of Democratic Change (MDC) </p><p>leader Morgan Tsvangirai on charges of treason until next </p><p>February.  We believe the postponement indicates the GoZ </p><p>has been unable to build a strong case against its main </p><p>political foe. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Eleventh Hour Accusations </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In a bizarre case of political intrigue, the GoZ </p><p>brought charges of high treason, punishable by death, </p><p>against Tsvangirai and two other party officials </p><p>immediately before last March\'s controversial election. </p><p>Former Israeli agent Ari Ben-Menashe implicated them in </p><p>an alleged plot to assassinate President Mugabe.  Ben- </p><p>Menashe had allegedly shot a video of himself discussing </p><p>the plot with Tsvangirai. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Procedural Defects in a Structurally Weak Case </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) According to local attorneys, the Zimbabwean legal </p><p>system differs from the US system in that defendants are </p><p>not automatically entitled to review evidence that will </p><p>be used by the prosecution.  In this case, Tsvangirai\'s </p><p>attorneys requested postponement because they had </p><p>received neither a copy of the allegedly damning </p><p>audiotape nor a transcript, both of which they had </p><p>requested.  There is speculation that the State </p><p>manipulated the audiotape, so Defense is seeking to have </p><p>an expert examine the original before the trial begins. </p><p>Additionally, Defense complained of delays in receiving </p><p>an outline of State\'s case against the three defendants. </p><p>Finally, Defense requested postponement because the </p><p>original court date was set without consultation with </p><p>defense attorneys, in violation of accepted practice. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) While the decision whether or not to grant the </p><p>postponement was a matter of the High Court\'s discretion, </p><p>the prosecution failed to contest the application.  Local </p><p>attorneys believe this failure to oppose, after earlier </p><p>threats by the State to vigorously contest postponement, </p><p>lends credence to the view that the GOZ has been unable </p><p>to build a case. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: Ben-Menashe is a shady figure who has </p><p>done consulting for Mugabe\'s government.  If the video- </p><p>tape exists, we suspect it shows evidence of manipulation </p><p>or involves a sort of baiting and entrapment that any </p><p>neutral court would throw out.  It seems Tsvangirai was </p><p>on the mark when he predicted to us in September (ref) </p><p>that Ben-Menashe\'s unwillingness to testify would weaken </p><p>an already flimsy case.  While the Government has planned </p><p>to try Tsvangirai and his colleagues at almost the same </p><p>time as alleged wife-killer and MDC MP Jonwe (who </p><p>subsequently died in custody), the GoZ must regard the </p><p>trial\'s postponement as a "next-best" outcome, since it </p><p>deprives the MDC\'s two most effective spokesmen </p><p>(Tsvangirai and Welshman Ncube) of their passports for </p><p>four more months and keeps the threat of a capital </p><p>indictment hanging over their heads. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
