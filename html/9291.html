<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000837 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BM, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMESE MPS-ELECT APPEAL TO SYG ANNAN, PLAN TO </p><p>ANNOUNCE PARALLEL GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Seventy Burmese MPs-elect (elected in the </p><p>junta-annulled 1990 election) have written to UN Secretary </p><p>General Kofi Annan informing him that they have asked Senior </p><p>General Than Shwe to release the political prisoners and </p><p>implement the UN resolutions regarding restoring democracy in </p><p>Burma.  They also ask the SYG to bring the plight of Burma to </p><p>the notice of the Security Council "for necessary action." </p><p>Post has forwarded the signed letter, text of which is </p><p>included in para 3 below. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Many of the MPs-elect signed the letter after meeting </p><p>at the funeral last month of an influential senior monk who </p><p>"died suddenly."  The monk provided assistance, food, and </p><p>lodging to MPs-elect when they were in Rangoon, and </p><p>occasionally sheltered pro-democracy activists from the </p><p>authorities.  Over 100 MPs-elect were reportedly willing to </p><p>sign the letter, but they decided 35 should not.  The </p><p>MPs-elect, we are told by a normally reliable source, intend </p><p>to declare a parallel government in the next month or two, </p><p>and wanted at least some members to be free if the seventy </p><p>who signed get arrested. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Text of the letter follows.  Signed original </p><p>pouched to EAP/BLCTV July 10th. </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Secretary-General </p><p> </p><p>Subject:  The Disgraceful Situation in Burma after the Crisis </p><p>at Da-Ba-Yin Township </p><p> </p><p>In the evening of May 30, 2003 some members of the National </p><p>League for Democracy (NLD) including U Tin Oo, Vice Chairman </p><p>and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, General Secretary while traveling </p><p>on an organizational tour were savagely attacked by a group </p><p>of thugs between Kyi village and Da Ba Yin town in Sagaing </p><p>Division resulting in several deaths and injuring hundreds of </p><p>NLD members.  The government has not clarified nor provided </p><p>details of the above event. </p><p> </p><p>Moreover, it is learnt that U Tin Oo, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi </p><p>and the youths who accompanied them on the journey were </p><p>seriously harmed and are also held under detention without </p><p>any legal ground. </p><p> </p><p>Hence the undersigned, the representatives who were duly </p><p>elected at the Multiparty Election held in 1990, on behalf of </p><p>the people of Burma, have sent a letter of protest to Senior </p><p>General Than Shwe, Chairman of the State Peace and </p><p>Development Council, calling for:- </p><p> </p><p>(1) Immediate release of U Tin Oo, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and </p><p>all others who were arrested at the site of the crisis. </p><p>(2) Unconditional release of U Aung Shwe, Chairman and other </p><p>Central Executive members of NLD who are kept under house </p><p>arrest since May 31, 2003. </p><p>(3) Reopening of all NLD offices sealed by the government and </p><p>resuming of legal political party functions. </p><p>(4) Official independent investigation and statement of facts </p><p>regarding the events including the number of deaths, wounded, </p><p>missing and detained persons. </p><p>(5) Compliance and implementation of the Resolutions and </p><p>Recommendations of the General Assembly, the Security Council </p><p>and other Agencies of the United Nations. </p><p> </p><p>The above demands are made for the people of Burma as well as </p><p>for the whole community of the world.  We firmly believe that </p><p>the current impasse in this country is not only a disgrace to </p><p>the Nation but is also becoming a threat to the peace and </p><p>security of the whole region. </p><p> </p><p>Attached herewith a copy of the abovementioned letter in </p><p>Burmese version with a humble request that the case should be </p><p>brought to the notice of the Security Council for necessary </p><p>action. </p><p> </p><p>Yours sincerely, </p><p> </p><p>Elected Representatives </p><p> </p><p>The List of Undersigned Parliamentary Members of 1990 General </p><p>Election (70 names follow) </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
