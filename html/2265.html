<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 003093 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR PDAS BELLAMY AND FOR AF/S </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/06/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEMARCHE AND DISCUSSION WITH NIGERIAN </p><p>SPECIAL ENVOY TO ZIMBABWE, EARNEST SHONEKAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 202946 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  During a December 1 meeting with recently </p><p>appointed Nigerian Special Envoy to Zimbabwe Earnest </p><p>Shonekan, Ambassador Jeter raised reftel talking points while </p><p>also leaving a nonpaper and a copy of the SADC Parliamentary </p><p>Forum election norms.  Pleased to hear our views, Shonekan </p><p>said he would factor our points in his upcoming discussions </p><p>in Harare next week.  He promised to consult with frequency </p><p>and to share information with us.  Acknowledging the weight </p><p>of the task before him, Shonekan thought that his good </p><p>personal rapport with Mugabe would help.  Shonekan stated </p><p>that his new role was not to supercede Nigeria\'s </p><p>participation in the CMAG but to complement the Commonwealth </p><p>effort with subtle private diplomacy.  The former Head of </p><p>State commented that he would urge Mugabe to desist from </p><p>inflammatory rhetoric and move deliberately toward better </p><p>economic management and a level playing-field for elections. </p><p>Shonekan believed that Mugabe was guilty of playing to the </p><p>hard-liners but was not wedded </p><p>to these extremists.  Concerted diplomatic pressure, backed </p><p>by incentives for good behavior, had a better chance of </p><p>persuading Mugabe than the threat of sanctions, according to </p><p>Shonekan. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Talking To Mugabe </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (?) At an afternoon meeting at Chief Shonekan\'s </p><p>colonial-era compound in Lagos appropriately named Lugard </p><p>House, Ambassador Jeter delivered reftel talking points and </p><p>discussed the election guidelines developed by the SADC </p><p>Parliamentary Forum. Jeter stressed that the September Abuja </p><p>Agreement had raised hopes that Zimbabwe would steer clear of </p><p>irrational action and walk the path toward responsible land </p><p>reform and democratic elections.  Instead, the trajectory of </p><p>events had been negative.  Political intimidation and the </p><p>truncation of civil liberties had intensified to the extent </p><p>that credible elections were unattainable in the current </p><p>atmosphere.  Without a change of course, the Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe risked further international opprobrium for </p><p>manufacturing defective elections when the conduct of decent </p><p>elections were within the GOZ, grasp but for the requisite </p><p>political will. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador continued that mal-governance was </p><p>harming the economy, now bogged down by the weight of a </p><p>ninety percent inflation rate and the understandable </p><p>skittishness of would-be investors. Moreover, Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>excursion into divisive, strong-arm politics and economic </p><p>brinkmanship mocked the tenets of the New Partnership of </p><p>African Development (NEPAD) launched by President Obasanjo in </p><p>October. Harare\'s misconduct presented a challenge to NEPAD </p><p>credibility.  Obasanjo and other leaders must do all they can </p><p>to prevent an important nation like Zimbabwe from flouting </p><p>NEPAD and undermining the group almost at its very inception. </p><p> Mugabe, Jeter underscored, was in danger of rewriting his </p><p>historical legacy from being an architect of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>independence to being responsible for mortgaging the </p><p>country\'s future to misguided short-term political </p><p>expediencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The affable Shonekan thanked the Ambassador for </p><p>sharing USG views and committed to keeping the lines of </p><p>communication open to us.  Shonekan observed his appointment </p><p>as Special Envoy was not to supplant Foreign Minister Lamido </p><p>or the Commonwealth process.  His role was to complement that </p><p>process by serving as a conduit for private, personalized </p><p>diplomacy between Abuja and Harare. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While acknowledging the difficult task before him, </p><p>Shonekan believed he stood in Mugabe\'s good books and that </p><p>their congenial relationship would reap benefits down the </p><p>road.  Recounting his days as civilian interim Head of State </p><p>between the khaki-garbed Babangida and Abacha regimes, </p><p>Shonekan retold his side-bar conversations with Mugabe during </p><p>Commonwealth and OAU meetings.  In those days, it was Mugabe </p><p>sidling up to Shonekan, giving avuncular prodding to </p><p>democratize Nigeria.  In a twist of fate, Shonekan would now </p><p>reciprocate with Mugabe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Shonekan mentioned he had visited Harare a few weeks </p><p>ago to present a letter from President Obasanjo to Mugabe. </p><p>In fact, his audience with Mugabe was scheduled immediately </p><p>after the Zimbabwean leader\'s tense session with the EU </p><p>delegation.  Shonekan, sensing that Mugabe was already </p><p>bilious after the EU encounter, decided to change tactics, </p><p>leaving "the stick" in the antechamber. Shonekan joked that </p><p>Mugabe looked surprisingly well despite the recent sparring </p><p>he had been doing.  After a laugh that broke the residual </p><p>tension still in the President\'s office, Shonekan contended </p><p>they held a substantive discussion free of rancor and </p><p>histrionics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Mugabe took issue with only one aspect of the letter </p><p>he presented from President Obasanjo, Shonekan declared. </p><p>Mugabe complained that Obasanjo\'s letter stated that Zimbabwe </p><p>had not honored its Abuja commitments, when the missive also </p><p>should have faulted London for not honoring its obligations. </p><p>Despite Mugabe\'s parsing of the letter\'s text, Shonekan found </p><p>him attentive and reasonable.  Mugabe did not seem wedded to </p><p>the hard-line posture he often assumed in public, Shonekan </p><p>said.  Much of Mugabe\'s hectoring was for domestic political </p><p>consumption.  Mugabe was playing to the hard-liners to shore </p><p>up his support.  Unfortunately, Mugabe had succumbed to </p><p>rhetorical excess.  One of the first things Shonekan said he </p><p>would propose to Obasanjo was for Obasanjo to personally urge </p><p>Mugabe to moderate his public statements and those of his </p><p>senior officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Elections </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Shonekan said he would review the SADC Parliamentary </p><p>Forum electoral norms and standards.  If Zimbabwe has signed </p><p>its name to these standards, Shonekan asserted, Mugabe cannot </p><p>now turn away from what he had endorsed previously. Showing </p><p>particular concern about Zimbabwe\'s aversion to election </p><p>observers, Shonekan opined that observers were necessary; </p><p>elections without observers would raise a negative </p><p>presumption against the credibility of the exercise.  Based </p><p>on his November conversations with Mugabe, Shonekan felt </p><p>Mugabe would ultimately relent on the issue of international </p><p>observers but would steadfastly resist an  EU observer team, </p><p>since he now considered Brussels his mortal enemy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>The Season For Land Reform </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Shonekan did not envy the UNDP delegation\'s job.  In </p><p>Zimbabwe during the team\'s visit, he remembered that they </p><p>were being pushed and tugged by sundry and divergent forces. </p><p>The team cannot write a report that will please everyone, </p><p>said Shonekan.  From his talks in Harare, he knew that the </p><p>report will be critical of the GOZ.  The task will be to </p><p>draft a non-political, technical report that, although </p><p>pointing a finger at the GOZ, did not ostracize Mugabe and </p><p>kept the door open to cooperation.  At that point, it would </p><p>be up to the diplomatic community to cajole Mugabe towards </p><p>doing the right thing on land reform, and keeping him from </p><p>using the report to line his wastebasket. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Ambassador Jeter reminded Shonekan that Mugabe </p><p>recently had moved faster in the wrong direction by amending </p><p>the Land Acquisition Act to accelerate farm seizures, as if </p><p>he wanted to rush wholesale seizures, perhaps to present them </p><p>to the international community as a fait accompli.  Shonekan </p><p>accepted that this misguided legislation would complicate </p><p>efforts to formulate a balanced reform program but said </p><p>Nigeria would try to influence Mugabe to return to his pledge </p><p>of cooperation with the international community on this </p><p>important issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>A Little More Prodding From Its Neighbors </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  Shonekan maintained that resolution of the land </p><p>reform was vital not only for Zimbabwe but for the precedent </p><p>it sets for South Africa.  South Africa has a large political </p><p>stake in Zimbabwe, he noted.  Because of the historic </p><p>affinity between ZANU-PF and the ANC and the volatility in </p><p>South Africa regarding land reform, Mbeki has been reticent </p><p>to exert pressure on Mugabe, according to Shonekan.  However, </p><p>the time has come for Mbeki and other SADC leaders to </p><p>pressure Mugabe, Shonekan believed.  Jeter concurred that a </p><p>unified chorus of neighbors might generate effective </p><p>political pressure that could not as easily be sidestepped by </p><p>an African leader as protestations from the West. The </p><p>Ambassador added that Nigeria might try to woo Namibia\'s </p><p>Nujoma to play an active and more positive role. Mugabe would </p><p>take notice if Nujoma, who at times has encouraged Mugabe\'s </p><p>antics, would now begin to counsel accommodation, Jeter </p><p>remarked. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Carrot, Stick, Or Both? </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  Shonekan felt that "positive pressure" could be </p><p>most effective on Mugabe.  Offering a roadmap of required </p><p>actions and parallel incentives (diplomatic and financial </p><p>reward) would have the best chance of getting Mugabe back </p><p>into the fold.  Shonekan feared that the threat of sanctions </p><p>would be counter-productive at this point.  He claimed </p><p>sanctions would only bolster GOZ hard-liners who are already </p><p>arguing that Mugabe should turn his back on  Western nations </p><p>because they were engineering his ouster.  A proposal that </p><p>highlights incentives would buoy moderates and help quiet the </p><p>hard-liners, Shonekan postulated.  Ambassador Jeter mentioned </p><p>the proposed Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act on </p><p>the Hill contained a number of potential incentives but also </p><p>held out the suggestion of sanctions if Mugabe continued his </p><p>undemocratic conduct.   Shonekan stated that the Democracy </p><p>Act seemed to strike the right balance; again, he stressed </p><p>that sanctions should not feature prominently at this moment </p><p>and shoul </p><p>d only be applied as a last resort.  (Note: Shonekan asked </p><p>for a copy of the proposed Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic </p><p>Recovery Act, which we will provide on Shonekan\'s return to </p><p>Nigeria.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) A well respected businessman, Shonekan lamented </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s macroeconomic condition.  Shaking his head after </p><p>Ambassador Jeter told him the inflation rate, Shonekan stated </p><p>that Zimbabwe used to export food but now needed humanitarian </p><p>aid to feed many of its people.  Shonekan worried that </p><p>continued mal-governance and exacerbation of the political </p><p>crisis eventually could lead to a meltdown.  It would be a </p><p>tragedy if Zimbabwe were to become a source of instability </p><p>and refugees in the SADC region, he declared. Ambassador </p><p>Jeter agreed that continued misrule could lead to political </p><p>and economic breakdown the tremors of which would be felt </p><p>throughout the region, particularly in South Africa. Not only </p><p>would its economy be hard hit by a Zimbabwean collapse, South </p><p>Africa would be asked to play host to thousands of refugees </p><p>who would see South Africa as their haven of first resort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Preparing to fly to London that evening for </p><p>consultations with the British, Shonekan believed that </p><p>Nigeria, thanks to his good offices, can exert some pressure </p><p>on Mugabe.  Whether that pressure will be sufficient to drown </p><p>out the hard-liners and give Mugabe the guidance needed to </p><p>walk out of the box in which he has placed himself is most </p><p>uncertain.  However, Shonekan\'s selection seems like a wise </p><p>move on two scores.  First, it increases GON bilateral </p><p>communication with Zimbabwe, making it much easier to sustain </p><p>diplomatic pressure than the periodic CMAG mechanism. </p><p>Second, that Shonekan may have a friendly relationship with </p><p>Mugabe, may make it easier for Shonekan to say some things </p><p>that would cause Mugabe to bristle if heard from another </p><p>source.  Additionally, Shonekan likes working with the US. We </p><p>anticipate that he will remain true to his promise to consult </p><p>and share information with us. End comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
