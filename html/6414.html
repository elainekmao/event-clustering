<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 000949 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ETRD, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: ICAO DEMARCHE DELIVERED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 66380 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 168200 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1. On March 16, 2003, EconOff met with Fawaz Al-Farah, Deputy </p><p>Director General of Aviation Safety and Air Transport at </p><p>Kuwait\'s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), and </p><p>Mohammad Abdul Rahim, Chief of the International Relations </p><p>Division at DGCA\'s Air Transport Department, to deliver </p><p>reftel A points.  Abdul Rahim and another Air Transport </p><p>Department staff member to be determined are planning to </p><p>represent the GOK at the ICAO Worldwide Air Transport </p><p>Conference in Montreal, including the two-day preparatory </p><p>seminar March 22-23. </p><p> </p><p>2. Al-Farah said that the GOK had initially intended to send </p><p>senior level officials to the conference, but decided instead </p><p>on lower, technical level representation due to the situation </p><p>in the region.  Al-Farah added that Kuwait\'s Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs has requested that the Kuwaiti Embassy in </p><p>Ottawa send its Ambassador or another senior level diplomat </p><p>to represent the GOK at the Extraordinary Assembly session </p><p>scheduled to convene immediately after the Transport </p><p>Conference. </p><p> </p><p>3. While Kuwait is not an Open Skies partner, Al-Farah said </p><p>the GOK could support many of the USG positions on </p><p>liberalization of air service rights.  The Kuwaiti officials, </p><p>however, would be attending the Montreal conference in </p><p>largely in a "listen-and-learn" capacity.  Al-Farah said once </p><p>the situation in Kuwait settles, the GOK would be interested </p><p>in reopening discussions on Open Skies. </p><p> </p><p>4. COMMENT: Per reftel B, Post has engaged in Open Skies </p><p>discussions with DGCA previously.  The results of those </p><p>discussions suggested the GOK does not fully understand the </p><p>implications of Open Skies.  We suggest appropriate USG </p><p>officials seek out GOK officials to review past efforts in </p><p>this regard in furtherance of Kuwait\'s "listen-and-learn" </p><p>mission. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
