(U) SUMMARY:  THE HOLY SEE ACTIVELY SEEKS TO INFLUENCE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03633  01 OF 03  231457Z </p><p>THE POLICIES OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS </p><p>AND PARTICIPATES INTENSELY IN THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE TO </p><p>PROMOTE ITS OWN AGENDA, PARTICULARLY ITS POSITION ON </p><p>SEXUALITY AND THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY.  THE HOLY SEE WILL BE </p><p>A U.S. ALLY ON ISSUES THAT DEFEND "HUMAN DIGNITY," SUCH AS </p><p>TRAFFICKING, PEACEKEEPING, DEVELOPMENT AID, AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS.  IT COULD BE A POWERFUL OPPONENT ON OTHERS SUCH AS </p><p>MILITARY INTERVENTION, SANCTIONS, THE DEATH PENALTY, AND </p><p>ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.  U.S. MISSIONS TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE WELL SERVED WHEN THEY </p><p>CULTIVATE AND MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH HOLY SEE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES, WORKING TOGETHER WHERE OUR POSITIONS ARE </p><p>COMPLEMENTARY, AND ENSURING U.S. POSITIONS ARE UNDERSTOOD </p><p>WHERE VIEWS MAY DIVERGE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>THE HOLY SEE\'S MULTILATERAL FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE HOLY SEE IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN A BROAD </p><p>RANGE OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS -- TYPICALLY AS AN </p><p>"OBSERVER" -- AND WORKS WITHIN THESE FORA TO ADVANCE </p><p>PRINCIPLES CENTRAL TO THE CHURCH\'S WORLD VIEW:  PRIORITY OF </p><p>THE HUMAN PERSON; THE PROMOTION AND, WHEN NECESSARY, THE </p><p>DEFENSE OF PEACE; SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY BUILDING </p><p>INITIATIVES; AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL ORDER </p><p>BASED ON JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  FM TAURAN RECENTLY </p><p>RESTATED THE HOLY SEE\'S BASIC MESSAGE TO UN MEMBER STATES: </p><p>ALL NATIONS ARE EQUAL, WITH EQUAL DIGNITY AND RIGHT TO </p><p>DEFENSE OF IDENTITY AND AUTONOMY; NATIONS MUST ACT IN </p><p>SOLIDARITY (I.E., ACCORDING TO RECIPROCAL MORAL OBLIGATIONS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03633  01 OF 03  231457Z </p><p>NOT ONLY TO TREAT EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT BUT TO SEE THAT </p><p>PEOPLES\' BASIC NEEDS ARE MET).  THE HOLY SEE REGARDS THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM AS AN IDEAL FORUM AND PRIVILEGED </p><p>PLATFORM TO ADVANCE THESE PRINCIPLES MULTILATERALLY.  AS A </p><p>RESULT, IT HAS TENDED TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN FACED WITH </p><p>THE UN\'S FAILINGS, PARTICULARLY ITS BUREAUCRATIC </p><p>DEFICIENCIES.  IT IS UNLIKELY TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT U.S. </p><p>CRITIQUES OF THE UN.  HOWEVER, THE HOLY SEE WILL NOT </p><p>HESITATE TO CRITICIZE THE UN AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>DIRECTLY WHEN THESE ENGAGE IN A PERCEIVED ASSAULT ON THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S CORE PRINCIPLES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  IN OPTING FOR PERMANENT OBSERVER STATUS RATHER THAN </p><p>FULL MEMBERSHIP IN MOST ORGANIZATIONS, THE HOLY SEE HAS </p><p>SOUGHT TO EMPHASIZE ITS MORAL, RATHER THAN POLITICAL, </p><p>AUTHORITY, AND ITS UNIQUE INTERNATIONAL JURIDICAL STATUS. </p><p>THE HOLY SEE THEREFORE OPERATES FROM A DOCTRINAL AND </p><p>PRINCIPLE-BASED PERSPECTIVE WITHIN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN ITS REPUTATION OF BEING "SUPER </p><p>PARTES" - A DISINTERESTED MORAL AGENT ACTING FOR THE GOOD OF </p><p>HUMANITY.  THE HOLY SEE IS RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE IN PURELY </p><p>"POLITICAL" MATTERS, SUCH AS THE UNSC VOTE ON SUDAN\'S </p><p>MEMBERSHIP, EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF ESCHEWING ITS VOTE ON SUCH </p><p>MATTERS IN FORA WHERE IT HAS A VOTE.  THE HOLY SEE PREFERS </p><p>NOT TO ENGAGE ON OPERATIONAL ISSUES SUCH AS CANDIDACIES FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, PREFERRING TO BE IN THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION BUT NOT OF IT.  IN THE SUDAN CASE, IT DID TAKE </p><p>AN ACTIVE BUT BEHIND THE SCENES ROLE IN DISCUSSING WITH </p><p>OTHER UNSC DELEGATES THE INAPPROPRIATENESS OF SUDAN AS A </p><p>UNSC MEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03633  01 OF 03  231457Z </p><p>4. (SBU) SOME WITHIN THE CHURCH HIERARCHY HAVE QUESTIONED </p><p>WHETHER THE HOLY SEE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED BY FULL VOTING </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN MORE ORGANIZATIONS, BUT AS BISHOP MARCHETTO OF </p><p>THE COUNCIL FOR THE PASTORAL CARE OF MIGRANTS AND TRAVELERS </p><p>RECENTLY POINTED OUT TO US, OBSRVER STATUS GIVES THE HOLY </p><p>SEE THE BEST OF BOTH ORLDS:  IT CAN PARTICIPATE IN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS AS ACTVELY AS ANY MEMBER, BUT RETAINS THE </p><p>ABILITY TO SAY ABOVE THE FRAY AND "SAY THINGS THAT NEED TO </p><p>BESAID." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  THE HOLY SEE\'S PRINCIPLES TRANSATE INTO A SERIES </p><p>OF STRONGLY HELD POSITIONS ON SSUES OF PRIORITY INTEREST TO </p><p>THE UNITED STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THAT </p><p>WAR MUST ALWAYS BE REFUTED AND PRIORITY GIVEN TO NEGOTIATION </p><p>AND THE USE OF JURIDICAL MEANS FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION.  IT </p><p>WILL THEREFORE OPPOSE THE USE OF FORCE UNLESS THE </p><p>REQUIREMENTS OF ITS JUST WAR DOCTRINE ARE FULFILLED, AS WAS </p><p>THE CASE IN THE LIBERATION OF KUWAIT, BUT NOT IN THE </p><p>CONTINUED MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ (REFTEL).  THE HOLY </p><p>SEE ALSO USES MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY TO PROTECT HUMAN LIFE </p><p>FROM CONCEPTION TO NATURAL DEATH, AS WELL AS TO PROMOTE ITS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4187 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03633  02 OF 03  231458Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   SS-00    TEST-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------CF169A  231458Z /38 </p><p>R 231456Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>GENEVA IO MISSIONS COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 VATICAN 003633 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. EUR/WE (MENNUTI), IO, IO/UNP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, AORC, UN, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: WORKING WITH THE HOLY SEE IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS - POWERFUL ALLY AND OCCASIONAL FOE </p><p> </p><p>TRADITIONAL JUDEO-CHRISTIAN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FAMILY.  IT </p><p>FAVORS GRADUAL REDUCTION IN MILITARY SPENDING AND EFFECTIVE </p><p>DISARMAMENT, SEEKS TO PROMOTE RESPECT FOR CULTURES AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS, AND DEMONSTRATES SOLIDARITY WITH POOR </p><p>COUNTRIES TO PROMOTE THEIR DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03633  02 OF 03  231458Z </p><p>POWERFUL ALLY EFFECTIVE FOE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) IN MANY CASES, U.S. AND VATICAN VIEWS ARE </p><p>COMPATIBLE, AND HOLY SEE DIPLOMATS CAN BE VALUABLE ALLIES. </p><p>WHERE THE USG SEEKS TO PROMOTE HUMAN VALUES AND RELIEVE </p><p>HUMAN SUFFERING BY MEDIATING CONFLICTS, COMBATING DISEASE, </p><p>AND PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, THE HOLY SEE WILL BE A STRONG </p><p>PARTNER.   THE HOLY SEE PERCEIVES A CLOSER THAN EVER </p><p>CONVERGENCE WITH THE USG IN SEVERAL AREAS.  THE MOST </p><p>UNAMBIGUOUS EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE RECENT COORDINATION OF </p><p>POSITIONS IN SUPPORT OF A UN CONVENTION TO BAN ALL FORMS OF </p><p>HUMAN CLONING, AN EFFORT THAT WAS EXTREMELY WELL-RECEIVED AT </p><p>THE HIGHEST LEVELS IN THE CURIA.  POST IS ALSO ENGAGED WITH </p><p>RELEVANT CURIA OFFICES IN A DIALOGUE TO EXPLORE QUESTIONS OF </p><p>FOOD SECURITY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND THE POSITIVE </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO BE MADE BY GMOS.  WHILE THE HOLY SEE HAS YET </p><p>TO BE CONVINCED THAT USG COMMERCIAL INTERESTS ARE NOT THE </p><p>DRIVING MOTIVATION FOR OUR SUPPORT FOR GMO\'S, THEY ARE </p><p>WILLING TO DISCUSS GMOS WITH AN OPEN MIND AS A MEANS OF </p><p>INCREASING FOOD SECURITY.  IF WE CAN MAKE OUR CASE, THE HOLY </p><p>SEE COULD BECOME A POWERFUL BOOSTER IN THE FAO AND THE </p><p>COUNCIL OF EUROPE TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR GMO\'S AS A MEANS TO </p><p>ALLEVIATE HUNGER.  IF, HOWEVER, THE HOLY SEE WERE TO </p><p>CONCLUDE THAT GMOS ARE IMMORAL, IT COULD COMPLICATE OUR </p><p>EFFORTS TO PROMOTE U.S. AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS AND </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO THE ALLEVIATION OF HUNGER THROUGH GMO\'S. </p><p> </p><p>7.   (U) SOME WITHIN THE HOLY SEE BELIEVE THAT A FEW WESTERN </p><p>NATIONS AND NGOS HAVE HIJACKED THE UN TO PROMOTE FEMINIST </p><p>AND HOMOSEXUAL AGENDAS THAT REFLECT MINORITY POSITIONS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03633  02 OF 03  231458Z </p><p>WITHIN THE NGO\'S HOME COUNTRIES.  AT THE CAIRO CONFERENCE, </p><p>AS WELL AS IN BEIJING IN 1995, THE HOLY SEE FORMED EFFECTIVE </p><p>ALLIANCES WITH CONSERVATIVE SOUTH AMERICAN AND ISLAMIC </p><p>STATES SUCH AS GUATEMALA AND LIBYA IN SUPPORT OF ITS </p><p>POSITION.  THE STRATEGY WAS SUCCESSFUL AND WE EXPECT IT TO </p><p>BE USED AGAIN.  ACCORDING TO FM TAURAN, THE HOLY SEE\'S BASIC </p><p>POSITION IS THAT A FAMILY IS CONSTITUTED OF A MAN AND A </p><p>WOMAN IN A PERMANENT RELATIONSHIP, AND THAT HUMAN NATURE AND </p><p>UNIVERSAL RIGHTS EXIST AND ARE SANCTIONED IN THE "GREAT </p><p>DOCUMENTS AND CONVENTIONS THAT REGULATE THE LIFE OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY."  TAURAN SAID THE HOLY SEE WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO PROMOTE A CONSERVATIVE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN MORALITY </p><p>OF SEXUAL ABSTINENCE OUTSIDE OF LEGAL MARRIAGE, FIDELITY </p><p>WITHIN MARRIAGE, AND OPPOSITION TO ARTIFICIAL FORMS OF </p><p>CONTRACEPTION, ABORTION AND THE DEATH PENALTY.  OBVIOUSLY, </p><p>THIS APPROACH LEADS THE HOLY SEE TO BALKS AT WIDELY </p><p>SANCTIONED APPROACHES ON SOME ISSUES SUCH AS CONDOM USE TO </p><p>PREVENT HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA, PREFERRING TO FOCUS ON </p><p>EDUCATION, ABSTINENCE, AND TREATMENT.  THE HOLY SEE HAS ALSO </p><p>LOBBIED AGAINST REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INITIATIVES SUCH AS </p><p>ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION AND ABORTION FOR WOMEN IN REFUGEE </p><p>CAMPS DURING RECENT CONFLICTS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE </p><p>VIGOROUSLY TO PROMOTE ITS VIEWS ON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.   (SBU)  THE HOLY SEE WILL ACTIVELY CULTIVATE ALLIANCES </p><p>WITH ANY STATE OR ORGANIZATION THAT FOSTERS TRADITIONAL </p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF THE FAMILY, CONSERVATIVE SEXUAL AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03633  02 OF 03  231458Z </p><p>REPRODUCTIVE POSITIONS, EQUITABLE ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION, </p><p>AND ETHICAL PRINCIPALS THAT RECOGNIZE AND PROTECT HUMAN LIFE </p><p>FROM CONCEPTION TO NATURAL DEATH.  THE HOLY SEE WILL BE </p><p>AGGRESSIVE IN FOSTERING SUCH ALLIANCES, AS WHEN IT SOLICITED </p><p>THE SUPPORT OF MOSLEM STATES DURING RECENT UN CONFERENCES. </p><p>THE HOLY SEE ALSO ENCOURAGES SYMPATHETIC NGOS ACCREDITED TO </p><p>THE UN TO LOBBY INDIVIDUAL STATES ON SO-CALLED MORAL ISSUES. </p><p>VATICAN OFFICIALS ARE VERY OPEN TO DISCUSSION WITH U.S. </p><p>OFFICIALS, ARE NOT MONOLITHIC IN VIEW, AND CAN BE CONVINCED </p><p>BY MORAL ARGUMENTS.  TO GAIN THEIR SUPPORT, EMBASSIES SHOULD </p><p>SEEK TO CONVEY TO HOLY SEE REPRESENTATIVES HOW OUR POLICIES </p><p>CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ADVANCING THE PRINCIPLES THEY HOLD DEAR. </p><p> </p><p>9.
