<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 010666 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: 2000 TERRORISM REPORT (COLOMBIA) </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 21748 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY BOGOTA\'S SUBMISSION FOR THE </p><p>2000 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT, KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS </p><p>POSED IN REFTEL: </p><p> </p><p>A.  RESPONSE OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO TERRORISM: COLOMBIA\'S </p><p>PROSECUTOR GENERAL (A BRANCH OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>INDEPENDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE) CONTINUES TO GIVE HIGH </p><p>PRIORITY TO THE PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS.  IN 2000, THE </p><p>PROSECUTOR GENERAL SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTED A LARGE </p><p>NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS -- BOTH </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN) AND REVOLUTIONARY ARMED </p><p>FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC), AND MEMBERS OF PARAMILITARY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS -- ON DOMESTIC TERRORISM CHARGES.  THE </p><p>PROSECUTOR GENERAL\'S OFFICE HAS COOPERATED CLOSELY WITH </p><p>U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE PROSECUTION OF </p><p>MEMBERS OF ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS ACCUSED OF KIDNAPPING </p><p>AMCITS. </p><p> </p><p>B.  TERRORIST EXTRADITIONS BY HOST GOVERNMENT: THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FOREIGN </p><p>GOVERNMENT REQUESTS, INCLUDING USG REQUESTS, TO </p><p>EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN 2000. </p><p> </p><p>C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION: </p><p>COLOMBIA\'S INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT, THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS </p><p>OF ITS NARCOTICS TRADE, AND THE PERVASIVE EFFECT OF </p><p>CORRUPTION ON ITS POLITICAL AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS </p><p>CONTINUE TO WORK AGAINST THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE </p><p>PROSECUTION AND CONVICTION OF DOMESTIC CRIMINALS, </p><p>INCLUDING TERRORISTS.  THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTION OF </p><p>1991 AUTHORIZES THE EXTRADITION OF COLOMBIAN NATIONALS </p><p>SOUGHT FOR CRIMES COMMITTED AFTER DECEMBER 1997, IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE.  THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT APPLIED THIS LAW FORCEFULLY IN 2000 </p><p>TO COMPLY WITH SEVERAL U.S. EXTRADITION REQUESTS OF </p><p>COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS, INCLUDING NARCO-TRAFFICKERS. </p><p> </p><p>D.  RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY AND THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAVE CONSISTENTLY </p><p>RELEASED PUBLIC STATEMENTS CONDEMNING ACTS OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  THE EXECUTIVE AND </p><p>JUDICIAL BRANCHES HAVE MADE SERIOUS EFFORTS TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE DOMESTIC TERRORIST INCIDENTS AND TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. </p><p>COLOMBIA BELONGS TO INTERPOL AND SHARES CRIMINAL </p><p>INFORMATION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.  THE U.S. MAINTAINS AN </p><p>ACTIVE LEGAL ATTACHE OFFICE IN BOGOTA, WORKING CLOSELY </p><p>WITH COLOMBIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ARREST AND PROSECUTE </p><p>COLOMBIAN TERRORISTS RESPONSIBLE FOR KIDNAPPING OF </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS, AND OTHER CRIMES.  THE U.S. BUREAU OF </p><p>ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND FIREARMS (ATF) ALSO MAINTAINS AN </p><p>OFFICE IN BOGOTA.  ATF IS THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR ALL </p><p>GOC ENTITIES CHARGED WITH INVESTIGATING TERRORIST </p><p>BOMBINGS.  THE ATF HAS A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>ITS COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT COUNTERPART AGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>E.  MAJOR 2000 COUNTER-TERRORISM STEPS: THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>ARMY AND POLICE TOOK SIGNIFICANT STEPS IN 2000 TO COMBAT </p><p>KIDNAPPINGS AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTS BY THE NATION\'S </p><p>MAIN INSURGENT/TERRORIST GROUPS, THE ELN AND FARC, AND </p><p>PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATIONS.  THE ARMY TRAINED, EQUIPPED </p><p>AND FIELDED ITS SECOND COUNTER-NARCOTICS BATTALION, </p><p>DESIGNED TO SUPPORT NATIONAL POLICE EFFORTS TO THWART </p><p>FARC AND ELN LINKS TO NARCOTICS PRODUCTION AND </p><p>TRAFFICKING.  THE ARMY AND POLICE ANTI-KIDNAPPING UNITS </p><p>UNDERTOOK SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS TO BREAK-UP FARC </p><p>AND ELN KIDNAPPING RINGS AND GAIN THE RELEASE OF SEVERAL </p><p>KIDNAPPING VICTIMS.  A SUCCESSFUL ARMY MILITARY </p><p>OPERATION AGAINST THE ELN LED TO THE RELEASE OF SOME 31 </p><p>COLOMBIAN NATIONALS KIDNAPPED ON SEPTEMBER 18 IN THE </p><p>CITY OF CALI.  TWO AMERICANS KIDNAPPED IN THAT INCIDENT </p><p>WERE RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 21.  A SUCCESSFUL ARMY </p><p>MILITARY OPERATION IN THE SUMAPAZ REGION SOUTH OF BOGOTA </p><p>LED TO THE RELEASE OF SEVERAL LONG-HELD KIDNAP VICTIMS </p><p>AND THE BREAK-UP OF A FARC KIDNAPPING RING OPERATING IN </p><p>BOGOTA.  IN OCTOBER, THE POLICE ARRESTED THE HEAD OF AN </p><p>ELN KIDNAPPING/EXTORTION RING OPERATING IN THE CITY OF </p><p>CALI.  COLOMBIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTINUED TO COOPERATE </p><p>WITH U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT IN GAINING THE RELEASE OF </p><p>SEVERAL KIDNAPPED AMCITS.  IN OCTOBER, THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>POLICE RESCUED A MINOR AMCIT HELD FOR SIX MONTHS BY </p><p>INDIVIDUALS CONNECTED WITH THE FARC. </p><p> </p><p>F.  SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO OPPOSE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. </p><p> </p><p>G.  STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING </p><p>COUNTRIES ON TERRORISM ISSUES: NONE. </p><p> </p><p>H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGE ON ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS TERRORISM </p><p>REMAINS CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY NEGATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>I.  U.S. EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH HOST GOVERNMENT: </p><p>THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO COOPERATE FULLY </p><p>WITH USG INVESTIGATIONS INTO ANTI-U.S. ACTS OF </p><p>TERRORISM.  ALL 16 AMCITS KIDNAPPED IN COLOMBIA IN 1999 </p><p>HAVE BEEN RELEASED.  ONE AMCIT WAS KIDNAPPED IN SANTA </p><p>MARTA IN OCTOBER, BUT IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS </p><p>KIDNAPPED BY COMMON CRIMINALS AND NOT A TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  USG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CONTINUE TO </p><p>PROVIDE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING ANTI-TERRORISM </p><p>TRAINING, TO COLOMBIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>J.  COOPERATION IN LAST FIVE YEARS: </p><p> </p><p>(1) BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AGENCIES OF THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE IN </p><p>SEEKING TO APPREHEND, CONVICT AND PUNISH </p><p>INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS AND INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>(2) BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AGENCIES OF THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ARE COOPERATING IN SEEKING TO </p><p>PREVENT FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST AMCITS IN </p><p>COLOMBIAN TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>K.  COOPERATION TO PREVENT ANTI-U.S. ACTS OF TERRORISM: </p><p>BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AGENCIES OF THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY COOPERATIVE IN THE LAST </p><p>FIVE YEARS IN SEEKING TO PREVENT FURTHER ACTS OF </p><p>TERRORISM AGAINST AMCITS IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p></p></div>
