(C) THE MB HAS A LONG-TIME, PUBLIC AFFILIATION WITH </p><p>HAMAS, DESPITE ITS DECLARED POLICY AGAINST THE USE OF </p><p>VIOLENCE (REF B).  VIOLENT ACTS PERPETRATED BY HAMAS </p><p>AGAINST ISRAELIS ARE, AS ISLAMIST MP ABDUL MAJEED </p><p>AQTASH TOLD POLOFF SEPTEMBER 15, "A REVOLUTIONIST </p><p>RESPONSE TO ISRAELI INJUSTICE, KILLING, OCCUPATION AND </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF THE PALESTINIAN INFRASTRUCTURE."  AQTASH </p><p>CALLED HAMAS "THE MILITARY WING FOR ALL MUSLIMS, NOT </p><p>JUST THE MB". </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN FILASTIN AL- </p><p>MUSLIMAH (THE DATE OF THE INTERVIEW WAS NOT GIVEN BUT </p><p>APPEARS TO BE EARLY AUGUST), THE INTERVIEWER ASKED </p><p>JORDANIAN MB LEADER THUNAYBAT TO DEFINE THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MB AND HAMAS.  THUNAYBAT </p><p>RESPONDED, "WE CONSIDER OURSELVES ONE PEOPLE AND THUS </p><p>ONE MOVEMENT...WE HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AND THE SAME </p><p>CAUSE...WE PRAY FOR THEM AND STRETCH OUR HANDS OUT TO </p><p>THEM IN RESISTING AGAINST THE OCCUPATION AND IN WARDING </p><p>OFF THE HARM FROM THE SONS OF OUR PEOPLE IN PALESTINE. </p><p>AS FOR THE BROTHERS IN HAMAS, THEY ARE THE VANGUARD OF </p><p>JIHAD IN OCCUPIED PALESTINE.  JIHAD IS ONE OF THE </p><p>DUTIES IMPOSED UPON US BY GOD ALMIGHTY, AND IT IS ONE </p><p>OF THE PILLARS ON WHICH THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD MOVEMENT </p><p>WAS FOUNDED.  WE BACK AND SUPPORT OUR BROTHERS IN THIS </p><p>BLESSED MOVEMENT WITH ALL THE POWER WE HAVE AND WILL </p><p>ALL THE MATERIAL, MORAL AND INFORMATION SUPPORT WE CAN </p><p>GIVE THEM." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THUNAYBAT GIVES A ROSIER VIEW OF THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MB AND HAMAS IN THIS PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT THAN MB MEMBER AND INTELLECTUAL IBRAHIM </p><p>GHARAIBEH (STRICTLY PROTECT) DESCRIBED TO POLOFF IN A </p><p>CONVERSATION TWO MONTHS AGO.  GHARAIBEH, EDITOR OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC MAGAZINE AL-UMMAH, TOLD POLOFF JULY 14 THAT THE </p><p>MB HAD DECIDED TO CEASE ALL RELATIONS WITH HAMAS UNTIL </p><p>HAMAS RESOLVES A POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE LEADERS </p><p>INSIDE THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AND OUTSIDE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) GHARAIBEH SAID THE PALESTINIAN MB APPROACHED </p><p>THE JORDANIAN MB IN THE 1980\'S FOR ASSISTANCE TO FORM </p><p>HAMAS.  THEY HAD AN AGREEMENT THAT HAMAS WOULD ONLY </p><p>FUNCTION WITHIN PALESTINE AND REMAIN COMPLETELY </p><p>SEPARATE FROM THE JORDANIAN MB, ALTHOUGH THE JORDANIAN </p><p>MB WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT (WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT WAS NOT </p><p>CLARIFIED).  WHEN "GOVERNMENTS STARTED TO HARASS </p><p>HAMAS", IT MOVED SOME OFFICES OUTSIDE OF THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES FOR SELF-PRESERVATION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>GHARAIBEH, THESE OUTSIDE LEADERS, SUCH AS KHALID </p><p>MISHA\'AL IN JORDAN, BEGAN COMPETING WITH THE INTERNAL </p><p>LEADERS, LIKE SHEIKH YASSIN, FOR CONTROL OVER THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  GHARAIBEH SAID SHEIKH YASSIN HAS ASKED </p><p>THE MB TO IGNORE DIRECTIVES FROM THE EXTERNAL LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) GHARAIBEH SAID THE JORDANIAN MB OPPOSES HAMAS </p><p>RECEIVING DECISIONS FROM OUTSIDE THE TERRITORIES.  IT </p><p>WANTS IT TO BE A PURELY PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATION AND </p><p>INDEPENDENT FROM ANY OUTSIDE SOURCE, INCLUDING THE </p><p>JORDANIAN MB.  HE SAID THE MB DOES NOT WANT HAMAS TO </p><p>BECOME LIKE NAYEF HAWATMA\'S DEMOCRATIC FRONT FOR THE </p><p>LIBERATION OF PALESTINE (DFLP) WHICH, ACCORDING TO </p><p>GHARAIBEH, IS ACTIVE IN SYRIA, BUT HAS FEW FOLLOWERS IN </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) COMMENT:  THE JORDANIAN REGIME, COGNIZANT OF </p><p>THE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE POLICIES OF BOTH </p><p>THE MB AND HAMAS, SEES NO ADVANTAGE IN OPENLY </p><p>CRITICIZING THE MB OVER ITS DECLARATIONS OF SUPPORT FOR </p><p>HAMAS.  IN THE MIND OF MOST JORDANIANS, TO BE ANTI- </p><p>HAMAS IS TO BE ANTI-PALESTINIAN - A MONIKER THE REGIME </p><p>SEEKS TO AVOID.  THE GOJ DOES, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO </p><p>MONITOR CAREFULLY LOCAL HAMAS LEADERS - THEIR CONTACTS, </p><p>STATEMENTS AND ACTIVITIES - AND DOES NOT SHY AWAY FROM </p><p>THREATENING HAMAS MEMBERS WHEN THEY HAVE OVERSTEPPED </p><p>GOJ-IMPOSED REDLINES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BURNS </p><p></p></div>
