<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002414 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  U.S. COMMENTS ABOUT ZIMBABWE\'S FOOD CRISIS </p><p>MAKE FRONT PAGES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Drawing on the Reuters report of Deputy Assistant </p><p>      Secretary Bellamy\'s November 2 interview with the </p><p>      Washington Times, both the government-owned Herald and </p><p>      independent Daily News lead with reporting on U.S. </p><p>      concern about Zimbabwe\'s food crisis.  The Herald\'s </p><p>      page-one, below-the-fold headline is "Anti-Zim Drive: </p><p>      U.S. Plans to Invade Harare."  The Daily News page- </p><p>      one, above-the-fold headline is "U.S. Threatens </p><p>      Zimbabwe: Warns of Intervention to Ensure Food Reaches </p><p>      Needy Regardless of Political Affiliation."  Both </p><p>      stories accurately quote Reuters and Washington Times </p><p>      reports, but the Herald provides page-two space for </p><p>      reactions from Government of Zimbabwe officials and </p><p>      supporters.  The reactions are predictably critical. </p><p>      Copies of both stories have been faxed to AF/S and </p><p>      AF/PD. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   The Herald also dedicates its November 6 </p><p>      editorial to the issue.  Under the title "U.S. threats </p><p>      an insult to Africans" editorial criticizes what it </p><p>      sees as U.S. "deceit." Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      "The threats by the American Government to </p><p>      openly undermine Zimbabwe\'s sovereignty should </p><p>      not be taken lightly, as it is a direct </p><p>      challenge to the universal norms of freedom that </p><p>      are not only cherished by Zimbabweans but by the </p><p>      entire free world.  Coming barely a few months </p><p>      after the launch of the African Union and the </p><p>      last SADC summit, the American utterance, that </p><p>      Africans are unworthy to stand as equals among </p><p>      the nations of the world, is an insult to the </p><p>      peoples of the continent as a whole. . ." </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The cynical justification for the </p><p>      threatened intervention is three tons of food </p><p>      aid that was reportedly confiscated from WFP by </p><p>      alleged ZANU PF youths and distributed in an </p><p>      unfair manner, although it is not stated whether </p><p>      those who got it were supporters of the party or </p><p>      not.  The three tons of maize in question can </p><p>      hardly feed one village for a day but for the </p><p>      Americans, it is good enough evidence to </p><p>      threaten the sovereignty of an independent </p><p>      country. . ." </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .To suggest that the U.S. will intervene in </p><p>      Zimbabwe in a manner that will undermine the </p><p>      country\'s sovereignty in order to ensure that </p><p>      food relief gets to the needy, irrespective of </p><p>      political affiliation is the height of deceit. </p><p>      If the Americans are that worried about the </p><p>      plight of hungry Zimbabweans, they are most </p><p>      welcome to pour in all the required food aid and </p><p>      distribute it themselves as long as it meets the </p><p>      specifications and requirements set by the </p><p>      government.  Unlike in Afghanistan where Yankee </p><p>      military planes were dropping bombs and bags of </p><p>      food aid simultaneously, here, they do not have </p><p>      to stretch themselves that far, as they will be </p><p>      most welcome to come in and do the distribution </p><p>      themselves while the government watches to </p><p>      ensure that food aid is not politicized." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
