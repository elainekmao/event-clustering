<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003409 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/23/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CASC, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR RAISES SECURITY, TIP, CHILD ABDUCTION </p><p>WITH INTERIOR MINISTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 3314 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 3408 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons 1.5 b and </p><p>d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In a May 22 meeting with Interior Minister </p><p>Aksu, Ambassador discussed possible terrorist threats against </p><p>the American community and the GOT\'s efforts to combat </p><p>Trafficking in Persons (TIP).  Ambassador also sought the </p><p>Minister\'s assistance in a U.S. child abduction case.  Aksu </p><p>promised cooperation on those issues, and requested </p><p>information on Turkish citizens he said are being held at </p><p>Guantanamo Bay.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Possible Threats to Embassy, Tourists </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador thanked Aksu for providing enhanced </p><p>security coverage for the Embassy community during the Iraq </p><p>war.  He said cooperation between the Turkish security </p><p>services and Embassy security officers is excellent. </p><p>Ambassador said new information indicates a possible </p><p>terrorist threat against diplomatic missions of the U.S. and </p><p>certain other countries worldwide.  There are also possible </p><p>threats to the broader American community overseas.  In light </p><p>of this, he would appreciate any additional security measures </p><p>Aksu could take.  In addition, Ambassador noted that a number </p><p>of cruise lines have resumed stops at ports in Istanbul and </p><p>Kusadasi.  This is a healthy sign for Turkey\'s economy. </p><p>However, Ambassador said he is concerned that these ships, </p><p>carrying many American passengers, could be targeted by </p><p>terrorists.  He would appreciate any extra security measures </p><p>the GOT could take.  Aksu said he will contact the Ankara </p><p>governor and security director and ask them to enhance </p><p>security for the Embassy and American community, and will </p><p>also direct the Coast Guard to enhance security for cruise </p><p>ships. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Trafficking Report </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador noted Department is preparing the 2003 TIP </p><p>Report for Turkey.  Embassy will continue to pass along </p><p>information from the GOT on TIP to the Department for </p><p>consideration.  Aksu averred that Turkey should not be ranked </p><p>in Tier III in the TIP Report.  He said the GOT takes the </p><p>issue very seriously; Tier III is designated for countries </p><p>that are not making serious efforts to combat human </p><p>trafficking.  Aksu said throughout his career, whenever he </p><p>has participated in international conferences, he has called </p><p>for international cooperation in three areas: drug </p><p>trafficking, terrorism, and TIP.  He argued that the GOT is </p><p>focusing intensely on all three areas, and Turkey should be </p><p>removed from the TIP Report altogether.  It appears that the </p><p>USG wants to rank Turkey in Tier III to create a balance </p><p>among Turkey and other regional countries, but Turkey is far </p><p>more advanced on this issue than its neighbors, he claimed. </p><p>Ambassador said Embassy will keep the Department informed of </p><p>the GOT\'s views.  He said one area of improvement for the GOT </p><p>might be the process of repatriating TIP victims.  Embassy </p><p>understands victims are sometimes sent to a neighboring </p><p>country that is not their country of origin.  The GOT might </p><p>be able to improve its performance in this area by working </p><p>more closely with the International Organization for </p><p>Migration (IOM).  Aksu claimed the GOT returns all victims to </p><p>their country of origin, and works in close cooperation with </p><p>IOM on repatriation (Note: We will continue to press this </p><p>point.  Regina Boucault, head of the IOM Ankara mission, told </p><p>us May 7 that the GOT is not/not cooperating with IOM on </p><p>repatriations and is sending some victims to countries that </p><p>are not their countries of origin.  End Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Child Abduction </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador stressed the importance of implementing the </p><p>Hague Convention on Child Abduction.  He noted that the </p><p>Convention requires that abducted children be returned to the </p><p>country from where they were abducted.  It is important that </p><p>countries enforce this provision so that parents are </p><p>discouraged from kidnapping their children and taking them to </p><p>a country where they expect to receive favorable treatment in </p><p>court.  This is an international problem that requires </p><p>international cooperation.  Ambassador thanked Aksu for his </p><p>help with the Sensoy child abduction case (Note: Ambassador </p><p>raised this case with the Justice Minister May 21 -- reftel </p><p>A. End Note).  Ambassador discussed this case with Aksu </p><p>December 17, and shortly thereafter the GOT located the </p><p>father.  Later, the Ambassador noted, the judge ruled that </p><p>the child be returned to her mother for the remainder of the </p><p>court process.  However, police have been unable to locate </p><p>the child.  Aksu said he had recently directed police and </p><p>Jandarma officials to locate the child.  He said he supports </p><p>full implementation of all international agreements, and </p><p>hoped to have information soon on the child\'s whereabouts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Guantanamo Detainees </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Aksu requested information on six Turkish citizens he </p><p>said are being held at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.  He said </p><p>the GOT had been receiving information about the detainees, </p><p>but recently there has been no information.  Ambassador said </p><p>he would seek information and respond (see reftel B). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
