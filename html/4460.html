REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) At a briefing at 3rd Brigade Headquarters in Pokhara </p><p>November 20, Brig. Gen. Prakash Basnet told DATT and poloff </p><p>he believes the Maoists are "slowly winning."  After making </p><p>significant inroads against the Maoists during the first </p><p>three months of the state of emergency (late </p><p>November-mid-February), the Army has since lost the upper </p><p>hand.  The insurgents are better organized and more unified </p><p>than the Government of Nepal, and are manipulating "weak and </p><p>cowardly" elements within democratic society to push for </p><p>dialogue.  Only the Maoists and the Army are working, in the </p><p>Brigade Commander\'s view; civilian government functions in </p><p>only about 20-30 percent of his area of operation.  Basnet </p><p>said he lacks sufficient manpower and mobility to defeat the </p><p>Maoists and has received no resources to implement Integrated </p><p>Security and Development Program (ISDP) projects in his area. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THE VIEW FROM THE WEST </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On November 20 DATT and poloff attended a briefing </p><p>offered by Brig. Gen. Prakash Basnet, Commander of the 3rd </p><p>Brigade headquartered in Pokhara (approx. 210 km northwest of </p><p>Kathmandu).  Basnet\'s AOR covers more than 39,000 square </p><p>kilometers, includes 16 administrative districts, and is home </p><p>to 4.6 million Nepalis.  The brigade is composed of three </p><p>infantry battalions; one engineering battalion; one </p><p>headquarters battalion; and seven independent infantry </p><p>companies, located at 61 different outposts.  (Note: </p><p>Independent companies are nearly twice the size of battalion </p><p>companies, with 235 soldiers vice 135.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Basnet said he believes the Maoists are "slowly </p><p>winning" the fight in his area.  During the first three </p><p>months of the state of national emergency (Nov. </p><p>26-mid-February 2002), Basnet used helicopters to deploy his </p><p>troops in an aggressive campaign against Maoist insurgents in </p><p>the 16 districts in his AOR.  The Maoists suffered serious </p><p>reverses as a result, Basnet asserted, and much of their </p><p>Central and some their Western Commands were shattered.  The </p><p>tide turned after the Maoist assault on the district </p><p>headquarters in Achham on February 17, however, when the </p><p>Royal Nepal Army (RNA) began moving its limited air assets to </p><p>other priority locations (e.g., the 11th Brigade in Kathmandu </p><p>and the Western Division).  Without helicopters, Basnet says </p><p>he has lost the mobility needed to maintain the offensive </p><p>advantage against the insurgents.  The civilian government </p><p>also failed to provide adequate resources to mount a credible </p><p>campaign against the insurgents, he charged.  The Maoists </p><p>used the monsoon to recruit, retrain and regroup, he </p><p>asserted, and are gradually rebuilding their Western Command. </p><p> (Note:  When asked if the Brigade was receiving more </p><p>resources since the King dismissed the previous government, </p><p>Basnet said that he had been given wire to build perimeter </p><p>defenses.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Large portions of his AOR remain under effective </p><p>Maoist control, Basnet acknowledged.  Only district </p><p>headquarters and a few other larger towns are safe.  Even the </p><p>Chief District Officer (CDO) in Pokhara\'s Kaski </p><p>District--considered one of the safest in the country--cannot </p><p>visit all the Village Devolopment Committees in his </p><p>jurisdiction.  The rest of the territory--including some </p><p>sites with RNA outposts--are dominated by the Maoists at </p><p>night.  In Baglung District, for example, two of the sites </p><p>with RNA garrisons are safe only during the day.  When </p><p>soldiers enter a town on patrol, the Maoists disappear.  At </p><p>night, however, when the soldiers return to the barracks, the </p><p>Maoists return to the villages.  Local government has largely </p><p>ceased to function, except in the district headquarters, </p><p>according to Basnet.  Police have, for the most part, also </p><p>withdrawn to locations fortified by the RNA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Since the beginning of the insurgency in 1996, the </p><p>16 districts in Basnet\'s AOR have suffered the destruction </p><p>of: </p><p> </p><p>--400 VDC buildings; </p><p>--6 telecom repeater stations; </p><p>--3 power stations; </p><p>--15 schools; </p><p>--24 health posts; </p><p>--30 banks; </p><p>--30 forestry posts; </p><p>--24 post offices; </p><p>--50 police stations; </p><p>--14 state-owned corporation offices; </p><p>--30 government vehicles; </p><p>--1 bridge. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>FAULT OF CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) For Basnet, responsibility for the RNA\'s failure to </p><p>counter the Maoists thus far lies squarely at the feet of </p><p>former democratically elected governments.  Self-interested </p><p>and corrupt politicians (and, he implied, civil servants) </p><p>were not serious about allocating enough sufficient financial </p><p>and human resources to fight the Maoists, he alleged.  For </p><p>example, the Brigade was never given funding to implement the </p><p>envisioned Integrated Security and Development Program </p><p>(ISDP), even though Gorkha--originally intended to be the </p><p>ISDP showcase district--falls within his AOR.  Civil servants </p><p>do not perform their assigned functions.  As an example, he </p><p>noted that the RNA brought the bodies of policemen killed in </p><p>a Maoist attack in April to the district hospital in </p><p>Gorkha--only to find that not one of five government doctors </p><p>assigned to the hospital was in town.  The bodies eventually </p><p>had to be brought to the Brigade headquarters in Pokhara for </p><p>post mortems.  Basnet estimates that only about 20 to 30 </p><p>percent of the 917 Village Development Committees (VDCs are </p><p>the smallest unit of local government) in his AOR are </p><p>currently operating.  Only the Maoists and the RNA are </p><p>working, he stated, indicating that ordinary people therefore </p><p>feel abandoned by their government.  "Are we winning hearts </p><p>and minds" this way? he asked rhetorically.  Intelligence </p><p>resources up to the state of emergency were poor, he </p><p>contended, because succesesive democratic governments had </p><p>been using the National Intelligence Division (NID) as a </p><p>repository for party hacks for the past 12 years. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Maoists successfully exploit the internal </p><p>bickering and tendentiousness commonplace among mainstream </p><p>politicians, thereby preventing the development of a strong </p><p>domestic political consensus against the campaign of terror, </p><p>he said.  "We are not united as the Maoists are," he </p><p>observed, adding that the insurgents have successfully </p><p>integrated political, military, psyops, and social elements </p><p>into their operational campaigns.  Even now, he charged, the </p><p>insurgents are manipulating "weak and selfish and cowardly </p><p>elements of democratic society" into pressing the Government </p><p>of Nepal (GON) for dialogue, instead of supporting the RNA in </p><p>its fight.  The militants have co-opted members of human </p><p>rights groups, newspaper editors, teachers, and "the ICRC," </p><p>along with assorted sociopaths and criminals, to promote </p><p>their ends, and have highlighted the GON\'s continued failure </p><p>to address the grievances of "ethnically disadvantaged" </p><p>groups, such as Tamangs, Magars, and the lowest castes, for </p><p>recruitment purposes.  (Some of the 60,000 ex-Indian Gurkhas </p><p>now living in the AOR have also provided training and funding </p><p>to the Maoists, Basnet said; India has been actively </p><p>assisting the GON in helping stop this.)  Thus, the Maoists </p><p>now "feel the national situation is changing in their favor," </p><p>he concluded. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>NEEDS:  TRAINED MANPOWER, MOBILITY, COMMO </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  "The Maoists know very well our weakness," Basnet </p><p>complained:  lack of adequate manpower and sufficient </p><p>mobility.  Because the Maoists only stay two days in any </p><p>given location, RNA troops need to be able to move quickly to </p><p>use intelligence on insurgent whereabouts, Basnet said.  When </p><p>the 3rd Brigade had more helicopters, they were better able </p><p>to interdict Maoist movements and training.  With only </p><p>limited air assets available since the attack on Achham, the </p><p>Brigade\'s mode has shifted to primarily a defensive one.  In </p><p>addition, Basnet estimates he needs 14 battalions (he now has </p><p>approximately 7) to counter the insurgents effectively.  The </p><p>troops must be better trained, he added, noting that the </p><p>amount of time new recruits spend in basic training has been </p><p>cut by two months.   Once they graduate from basic training, </p><p>recruits and other soldiers receive little on-duty training, </p><p>he confirmed. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  The RNA has a 900-officer deficit at the mid-ranks, </p><p>and the NCOs are weak, Basnet lamented.  Weapons are not the </p><p>most critical need when troops lack appropriate fire </p><p>discipline, he pointed out.  When Maoists launch nighttime </p><p>attacks on RNA fixed positions, Basnet said, they typically </p><p>use socket bombs, which are only about 50 percent reliable. </p><p>In these situations, the soldier forgets his training and, </p><p>panicked, will try to fire 300 rounds from one self-loading </p><p>rifle (SLR).  RNA soldiers will continue firing at an enemy </p><p>they cannot see until they run out of ammunition and/or the </p><p>weapon jams--which is virtually inevitable under these </p><p>conditions, Basnet observed.  Once the Maoists determine the </p><p>soldiers are indeed out of ammunition, they lead a more </p><p>targeted assault to overrun the position.  More basic </p><p>training with basic weapons and tactics in needed, he </p><p>emphasized. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Basnet cited secure communications as another urgent </p><p>need.  When Maoists attacked the district headquarters in </p><p>Arghakhanchi on September 7 (Ref B), Basnet called in air </p><p>support for beleaguered troops on the ground.  (As Brigade </p><p>Commander, his entire communication resources consisted of </p><p>one telephone line and one radio.)  But because the </p><p>helicopter had no way to communicate with the ground forces, </p><p>when it finally arrived, it began firing on RNA positions. </p><p>Basnet was, in turn, unable to communicate with the </p><p>helicopter pilot, and instead had to call the airport tower </p><p>in Kathmandu to contact the tower in Pokhara to pass the </p><p>message to the pilot. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>PLANNING </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Basnet, who had just returned that day from meeting </p><p>with the Chief of Army Staff, said he was unaware of the </p><p>existence of any national campaign plan. He has visited all </p><p>of the 61 RNA positions in his AOR, and has moved the </p><p>district headquarters in Arghakhanchi (which was overrun in </p><p>September) to a more strategic position atop a hill.  He does </p><p>not believe the development of village militias in </p><p>government-controlled areas is a useful concept for Nepal </p><p>right now.  If the national police cannot even adequately </p><p>defend a town--police attacked on November 15 in Gorkha held </p><p>out for only 15 minutes, he charged--how can villagers be </p><p>expected to? </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  According to Basnet, the Maoists plan to surround </p><p>all district headquarters (where the RNA maintains fortified </p><p>positions).  The Maoists have consolidated their previous </p><p>three regional commands into two (the Central Command, </p><p>according to one captured Maoist document, had supposedly </p><p>been infiltrated by "traitors"), and are steadily rebuilding </p><p>the loss of trained cadre in its Western Command, Basnet </p><p>fears.  The militants have written a development plan for </p><p>Rukum and Rolpa Districts, Basnet believes, and reported </p><p>having seen evidence suggesting Maoists are building a road </p><p>in Gulmi District.  A document captured recently from a </p><p>Maoist detainee also indicates plans to levy a two percent </p><p>tax on all government employees; to destroy village-level </p><p>infrastructure; to continue a series of nationwide strikes, </p><p>or "bandhs," and to disrupt any plans for local or national </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  Blaming the failures of successive democratic </p><p>governments for all the problems of Nepal today--including </p><p>the RNA\'s inability so far to counter the insurgency--is a </p><p>common refrain among Army leadership.  Whether the interim </p><p>government appointed by the King will succeed in marshalling </p><p>more resources for the fight--defense spending had already </p><p>risen to an all-time high of about one-quarter of the entire </p><p>budget under the previous government of Prime Minister </p><p>Deuba--remains to be seen.  Basnet\'s other comments, however, </p><p>constitute a significant departure from standard RNA </p><p>briefings, and may have been colored by his bearing </p><p>responsibility for the debacle at Arghakhanchi in September </p><p>(Ref B).  Nonetheless, his assessment that after nearly a </p><p>year in the field the RNA has made little headway against the </p><p>Maoists--and in some respects has even lost ground--is a </p><p>sobering one--and stands in marked contrast to the upbeat </p><p>assessment he gave the PACOM assessment team last April. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
