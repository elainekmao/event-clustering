<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 OTTAWA 000899 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO CDC </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, CA/OSC and M/MED </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AMED, SOCI, TBIO, CASC, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: Ontario Declares SARS Health Emergency </p><p> </p><p>Ref: State 072824 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Late on March 26, the province of </p><p>Ontario, faced with growing numbers of cases of </p><p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), </p><p>officially declared a "provincial emergency." </p><p>This represents a dramatic upgrade of measures to </p><p>contain the potential spread of SARS in the </p><p>greater Toronto area, the epicenter of Canada\'s </p><p>SARS cases.  In the last several days, "probable" </p><p>case numbers have jumped to 62, according to </p><p>March 27 "Globe and Mail" reports, making Ontario </p><p>the largest disease site outside Asia. </p><p>Provincial emergency responses and powers include </p><p>(so far voluntary) quarantine orders, potentially </p><p>for thousands of residents and scores of </p><p>emergency medical workers - which could slow </p><p>responses to `911\' calls; the closing of critical </p><p>care units in two major hospitals; round-the- </p><p>clock monitoring by a new Provincial Operations </p><p>Center; and an intense effort to track workers </p><p>and visitors to Scarborough Grace, the hospital </p><p>where Toronto\'s three SARS fatalities were </p><p>treated.  Post will send proposed Public </p><p>Announcement text via Septel. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Multi-ethnic Metropolis Potentially Vulnerable </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2.  Toronto, Canada\'s most populous urban center </p><p>with the nation\'s largest and most diverse ethnic </p><p>and immigrant populations - including one of the </p><p>largest Chinese populations outside Asia - has </p><p>been hit with the majority of the country\'s </p><p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) cases, </p><p>including its three fatalities to date.  With </p><p>high travel rates to and from Asia\'s vulnerable </p><p>areas - the March 26 "Toronto Star" reports </p><p>outbound travel from Toronto\'s Pearson </p><p>International Airport to southeast Asia at more </p><p>than 1,000 passengers daily - the SARS risk </p><p>potential is clear.  The Toronto district of </p><p>Scarborough, with notable concentrations of Asian </p><p>populations, is the focal point of concern and </p><p>attention.  Scarborough Grace Hospital, where the </p><p>three SARS fatalities were treated, was </p><p>completely closed on March 26, while a near-by </p><p>elementary school has also closed as a </p><p>precautionary measure. </p><p> </p><p>Current Profile - A Four-fold Jump in "Probable </p><p>or Suspect" Cases </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3.  According to the City of Toronto\'s March 25 </p><p>SARS Backgrounder, prominently posted on </p><p>Toronto\'s government website, health officials </p><p>report that, of the three fatalities, two were </p><p>related and had traveled to Hong Kong, while the </p><p>third, according to the "Star," had shared the </p><p>same hospital observation room with the one of </p><p>the two family victims.  As of March 25, the city </p><p>backgrounder referred to 15 "probable" and five </p><p>"suspect" cases.  Two days later, the March 27 </p><p>"Globe and Mail" and the CBC report an increase </p><p>of "probable cases" to at least 62 persons, </p><p>including a number of health care workers from </p><p>Scarborough Hospital. </p><p> </p><p>Multi-front Response: Institutional Closings and </p><p>Quarantine Orders; Could Slow `911\' Response </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>4. Under Ontario\'s emergency powers stemming from </p><p>its "Health Protection and Promotion Act" invoked </p><p>on March 26, an extensive quarantine search and </p><p>order is underway, targeting the potentially </p><p>"thousands of people" who visited, worked, or </p><p>were treated at Scarborough Grace Hospital from </p><p>March 16 onward.  In addition, the province\'s </p><p>"Emergency Plan Act," also invoked, authorizes </p><p>the use of emergency funds for disaster response, </p><p>if needed.  With SARS now designated a </p><p>"reportable, virulent, communicable disease," </p><p>this designation empowers public health officials </p><p>to prohibit those suspected of SARS from </p><p>"engaging in activities that may transmit" the </p><p>disease.  According to media, individuals must </p><p>voluntarily place themselves under a 10-day home </p><p>quarantine and wear a protective mask when </p><p>interacting with family members. </p><p> </p><p>5. The quarantine includes, according to CBC </p><p>reports, an estimated 50 ambulance staff and </p><p>paramedics who either had contact with victims, </p><p>or have exhibited possible symptoms of SARS. </p><p>Provincial emergency officials advised residents </p><p>to continue to use the "911" number but indicated </p><p>that response times may be slow. </p><p> </p><p>6. Two major hospitals have been closed or </p><p>restricted in the past 24-48 hours.  Scarborough </p><p>Grace Hospital staff told us that the facility is </p><p>completely closed, with access barred by masked </p><p>security personnel.  In downtown Toronto, Mount </p><p>Sinai, the city\'s premier medical facility, </p><p>closed its intensive care unit and emergency room </p><p>services, according to a hospital public affairs </p><p>officer.  The precautionary closure stems from </p><p>the fact as reported in the March 27 "Globe and </p><p>Mail" that a possible SARS patient was </p><p>transferred to Mount Sinai\'s acute care unit from </p><p>Scarborough over the weekend. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Working with Canadian federal and Toronto </p><p>municipal health personnel, Ontario\'s Ministry of </p><p>Health and Long-Term Care announced March 26 </p><p>additional tracking and containment measures </p><p>including: </p><p> </p><p>-- Planning to increase Ontario\'s isolation bed </p><p>capacity, potentially using new, unopened </p><p>facilities as a way to isolate patients with </p><p>symptoms; and </p><p> </p><p>-- Partnering with the City of Toronto in efforts </p><p>to identify a "broad sweep of people" who </p><p>may have come into contact with SARS sufferers. </p><p> </p><p>Canada Issues Health Travel Advisory while </p><p>Ontario Implements Health Protection and </p><p>Promotion Act Powers </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Health Canada, the nation\'s federal health </p><p>ministry, issued a March 25 travel advisory which </p><p>recommends that persons "defer all travel until </p><p>further notice to Hanoi, Hong Kong, Guangdong, </p><p>and Singapore."  In addition, federal health </p><p>officers are distributing SARS information cards </p><p>to passengers arriving at Toronto\'s Pearson </p><p>International Airport from Asian ports of </p><p>embarkation.  According to a pre-clearance </p><p>contact at Pearson International Airport, airport </p><p>personnel, including U.S. and Canadian inspection </p><p>officers, are not yet receiving protective gear </p><p>or working under special handling rules, although </p><p>individual services have counseled staff on SARS </p><p>characteristics. </p><p> </p><p>Multiple Info Sites and Free Clinics </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. Area residents or travelers concerned about </p><p>SARS can contact a variety of information </p><p>resources sponsored by all three levels of </p><p>government.  The public can call the province\'s </p><p>Telehealth Ontario hotline, 1-866-979-0000 and </p><p>Toronto Public health Hotline, 416-338-7600 for </p><p>clinical information and advice.  In addition, a </p><p>downtown Toronto clinic affiliated with the </p><p>respected Sunnybrook and Women\'s College Health </p><p>Sciences Center opened today offering assessments </p><p>on a walk-in basis to any individuals worried </p><p>about the disease. </p><p> </p><p>Comment:  Province, City Taking SARS Very </p><p>Seriously </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Far from minimizing SARS concerns that could </p><p>potentially affect business or tourist travel to </p><p>Canada\'s leading city, health authorities are </p><p>using whatever legal, research, and public </p><p>outreach tools they have to educate the public, </p><p>isolate symptomatics, and respond to this </p><p>unfolding disease profile.  But given a </p><p>metropolitan population close to five million and </p><p>strong Asian ties and travel patterns, the </p><p>difficulty of enforcing extensive quarantine </p><p>orders, as well as medical uncertainty over the </p><p>disease\'s etiology and clinical transmission </p><p>specifics, it is too soon to know whether Toronto </p><p>is over the worst. </p><p> </p><p>11. MINIMIZE considered. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
