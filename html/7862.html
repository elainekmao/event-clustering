<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000824 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PGOV, EPET, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  SHELL\'S "SEA EAGLE" ENDANGERED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. April 29 local newspapers reported that Shell\'s newly </p><p>deployed Floating Production and Storage and Offloading </p><p>Platform (FPSO), the "Sea Eagle," had been threatened by </p><p>unidentified criminal elements in the Delta.  Shell\'s </p><p>Nigerian subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company of </p><p>Nigeria (SPDC), reportedly had asked the federal government </p><p>for protection of the giant off-shore facility, which was </p><p>deployed in October 2002 to a position some 15 miles off the </p><p>coast of Delta State.  Two days earlier SPDC ran full-page </p><p>adds in local papers highlighting the threat and appealing to </p><p>"all well-meaning and law-abiding citizens" to prevent </p><p>criminals from attacking the Sea Eagle. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) on May 2 contacted </p><p>SPDC\'s Lagos-based Security Manager, who confirmed that he </p><p>had received "credible information" that militant youths in </p><p>Delta State were planning to launch a seaborne attack on the </p><p>Sea Eagle.  The youth reportedly were upset at not being </p><p>offered employment or other "concessions" by Shell for the </p><p>deployment of the FPSO off the Delta State coast.  SPDC </p><p>points out in its April 27 public notice that over 100 new </p><p>jobs for nearby communities were created as the result of the </p><p>Sea Eagle\'s deployment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The SPDC Security Manager said he had assurances from the </p><p>Navy Chief of Staff that the two USG-donated coastal patrol </p><p>boats would be used to protect the Sea Eagle from attack. </p><p>The Sea Eagle serves as an off-shore oil terminal, capable of </p><p>processing 170,000 barrels of oil and 100 million cubic feet </p><p>of gas per day.  It also has storage capacity of 1.4 million </p><p>barrels of crude oil. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
