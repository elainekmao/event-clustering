<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001376 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>INL/C FOR DLUNA AND JBRANDOLINO </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>TREASURY FOR EBARBER AND CWILKINSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KCRM, KSEP, SOCI, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: USG ANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 90733 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Corruption at the official level in Zimbabwe has </p><p>increased markedly in the last several years as the </p><p>Government has systematically undermined the rule of law to </p><p>browbeat political opponents and the ruling party has </p><p>expanded its already considerable system of patronage. </p><p>Corruption, once confined to petty transgressions, has </p><p>evolved into something on a grand scale, and it has permeated </p><p>every level of society from senior ministers and parastatal </p><p>executives to civil servants and peasants.  Nearly everyone </p><p>with ties to government or the ruling party has benefited </p><p>from the government\'s illegal and massive grab of commercial </p><p>farms.  A political environment of impunity has allowed </p><p>opportunists to flourish and senior officials to plunder the </p><p>country\'s dwindling resources.  The Government\'s half-hearted </p><p>effort at an Anti-Corruption Commission in the late 1990s </p><p>floundered and it remains unfunded and unstaffed. </p><p>Prosecutors have not pursued pending corruption cases against </p><p>several ministers and other high-level officials despite </p><p>promises from the head of state at the time that justice </p><p>would be swift and impartial. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Against this backdrop and given current chilly </p><p>US-Zimbabwe relations, the USG provides no anti-corruption </p><p>technical assistance to the GOZ.  Given the GOZ\'s </p><p>demonstrated lack of political will to fight corruption and </p><p>its history of politicizing and misusing direct assistance, </p><p>we would not encourage extending any assistance to the GOZ in </p><p>this area, nor would we advocate inviting GOZ representatives </p><p>to attend the anti-corruption conferences in South Korea next </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) There are no notable efforts in the Zimbabwe </p><p>private sector to temper corruption, but civil society groups </p><p>periodically press the GOZ to rein in corruption. </p><p>Transparency International Zimbabwe (TIZ) leads the civil </p><p>society effort, and has a director who coordinates with other </p><p>local NGOs, such as ZimRights and the Confederation of </p><p>Zimbabwe Industries, in fighting corruption.  USAID funds a </p><p>$100,000/year TIZ program that works with the Parliament of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s Public Accounts Committee in advocating </p><p>anti-corruption efforts in the public sector and in closing </p><p>loopholes in legislation that make corrupt practices easier. </p><p>For example, TIZ is seeking the repeal of sections of the </p><p>District Development Fund Act that tend to encourage </p><p>corruption at the local level.  TIZ also continues to press </p><p>the GOZ, through the Ministry of Justice, to fund and staff </p><p>the Anti-Corruption Commission, and permit it to undertake </p><p>its mandated mission.  The USG also sponsored TIZ\'s director, </p><p>John Makumbe, on an International Visitor Program visit to </p><p>the U.S. in early 2002. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
