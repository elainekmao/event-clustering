GNEHM, REASONS 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (S/NF) SUMMARY: In a wide-ranging tour-d\'horizon with </p><p>the Ambassador, former PM and FM Abdulkarim Kabariti candidly </p><p>weighed in on a variety of issues, foreign and domestic. </p><p>Kabariti is known for his strong views on domestic politics </p><p>and the GOJ\'s relationship with Iraq.  Kabariti\'s comments </p><p>need to be read in perspective.  He is a former government </p><p>official, very much on the outs.  His insights are </p><p>nonetheless invaluable and jibe with much of what we hear on </p><p>the street about the GOJ and the King\'s relationship to his </p><p>country and his government.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Ambassador paid a courtesy call on former PM and </p><p>FM Abdulkarim Kabariti July 17.  Currently CEO and President </p><p>of the Jordan Kuwait Bank, Kabariti served as PM from 1996-7 </p><p>and FM from 1995-6.  He has also served as Chairman of the </p><p>Foreign Relations Committee in the Jordanian House of </p><p>Representatives, First Deputy Speaker in the Upper House of </p><p>the Parliament, Chief of the Royal Court, and, most recently, </p><p>Senator. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>MEPP </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) Kabariti said it was "a miracle" that Jordan </p><p>seemed to be insulated from the effects of recent actions on </p><p>the West Bank/Gaza.  He credited the security measures and </p><p>precautions taken by the King, the direct result being that </p><p>emotions were not allowed "to build up".  He added that it </p><p>helped, too, that "everyone is happy making a living, </p><p>enabling them to send money back to Palestine".  He agreed </p><p>that the GOJ\'s strategy worked much better than even the </p><p>government expected. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF) Kabariti wondered aloud, however, if after U.S. </p><p>midterm elections there might be greater U.S. involvement in </p><p>resolving the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  He said that an </p><p>improvement in the situation in the Occupied Territories </p><p>would help "more than anything else" gain wider support for </p><p>American interests in the region and the GOJ as well.  He </p><p>said that perhaps some "disengagement with Sharon" after the </p><p>elections would "demonstrate an interest in the Palestinian </p><p>people, in their problems."  He said any uproar following an </p><p>American attack on Iraq would not be as much about Iraq as it </p><p>would be anti-American, a demonstration of sympathy with </p><p>Palestine.  Kabariti also said that Saudi Crown Prince </p><p>Abdullah should somehow be publicly rewarded for his role in </p><p>the peace process.  He said that, again, after the election, </p><p>there should be a plan that gives hope, and some </p><p>demonstration that C.P.Abdullah\'s initiative has "at least </p><p>been taken seriously". </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF) Kabariti noted that PM Abul Ragheb was "giving a </p><p>dangerous impression" with his repeated public denials that </p><p>American forces were present in Jordan and that Jordan would </p><p>not be used to support American action in Iraq.  He said that </p><p>once the U.S. does strike Iraq, one of two things will have </p><p>to happen: either the Abul Ragheb government will have to go </p><p>and a new one take its place, or the PM will be forced to say </p><p>"political realities" forced a complete change in policy. </p><p>Kabariti said he was "extremely worried" that because the </p><p>difference between the PM\'s public stand and reality was so </p><p>different, public opinion would be that much more difficult </p><p>to manage. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF) Kabariti related the PM\'s comments to Jordan\'s </p><p>relationship with Gulf countries.  He said this current </p><p>position on Iraq is troubling some of Jordan\'s friends.  By </p><p>way of example, he said senior Kuwaitis were "pissed off", </p><p>and had asked him directly if the PM was being bribed. </p><p>Kabariti said he defended the PM  and told his Kuwaiti </p><p>interlocutors that this was all part of "a domestic political </p><p>campaign to deal with the present political situation".  But </p><p>he said the strategy was "sure to backfire". </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>OIL AND THE PM\'S LEGACY </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF) A clearly troubled Kabariti added that "we\'ve </p><p>succumbed to the allure of business with Iraq".  He pointed </p><p>out that the PM\'s son had many Iraqi business ties and that </p><p>"it all looked very bad".  Responding to Ambassador\'s query </p><p>regarding illegal diversion of Iraqi oil (REF A), Kabariti </p><p>said the motive was "money, that\'s it".  Calling the scheme </p><p>"a sheer bribe", he said it was "a domestic money laundering </p><p>scheme" and that Zaid Juma of the Royal Court was aware of </p><p>it.  He said part of the money goes to the military, but most </p><p>of the money goes to "the bosses".  Kabariti said that "the </p><p>whole thing was packaged with the blessing of the Court and </p><p>the King".  He said that "the GOJ has never been so possessed </p><p>by intricacies and details" as it is by this sort of </p><p>business, and that, as a result, the government was in danger </p><p>of gaining a regional reputation as "a cheap bunch of </p><p>decision makers". </p><p>8.  (S/NF) Kabariti recalled the day PM Abul Ragheb was asked </p><p>to form the government.  He said that he advised Ragheb that </p><p>"once PM, there was no way to go but down" and that he would </p><p>need "luck, will, and devotion" to hold the job.  He told </p><p>Abul Ragheb "to think about the day you are asked to resign </p><p>and what your legacy will be.  Will it be as a reformer?" </p><p>Kabariti mused that rather than being "a strong man of the </p><p>Gulf", the PM was more "the strong oil man of Iraq", and five </p><p>years from now would be "perceived as an agent of Saddam, </p><p>being paid off by Saddam".  Kabariti said that this is </p><p>apparently the legacy Abul Ragheb wants, as he has made </p><p>himself "a hostage" to his pro-Iraqi comments and </p><p>connections. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF) Kabariti said the king needed to be more vocal in </p><p>molding public opinion in advance of a possible strike in </p><p>Iraq.  He said the king could frame the argument in such a </p><p>way that focused on Saddam\'s regime, rather than the Iraqi </p><p>people", that "so many good things cannot be realized by the </p><p>Iraqis" due to Saddam, and that "crimes against humanity, not </p><p>the Iraqi people, would be the target of any coalition </p><p>action.  Kabariti said the King\'s upcoming trip to Washington </p><p>would be a good time for him to get a "very clear message" on </p><p>how to "prepare the people for what\'s going to come".  Noting </p><p>that the King was not taking the PM to Washington, and that </p><p>this was a new policy, Kabariti said Abul Ragheb was told to </p><p>"be more like the Egyptian PM and focus on domestic affairs". </p><p> The King would handle international affairs.  He said Abul </p><p>Ragheb clearly did not like this development, and that he had </p><p>become "edgy and afraid" as a result. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S/NF) Kabariti agreed with the Ambassador that the </p><p>relationship between Washington and Amman was "improved from </p><p>years past" and that this was largely due to the respect the </p><p>Bush Administration had for the King, and the ability of both </p><p>the King and the Queen to connect with the American people. </p><p>But he added that the King "feels much more at ease on a </p><p>foreign platform than the domestic one" and said that they </p><p>were both "very insecure" in Jordan.  He added that this </p><p>insecurity leads to bringing "low caliber people" into the </p><p>government, because "no one, not the King, not the PM, wants </p><p>to be upstaged".  He said the King had not yet "developed his </p><p>father\'s ability to trust his advisors", and that "he does </p><p>not like politics at all".  As a result, he said, the King\'s </p><p>advisors are afraid to tell him anything.  (Note: Kabariti </p><p>also said the King "loves to axe people" in terms of removing </p><p>them from the government.  He said the King believes it </p><p>portrays the image of "a firm, determined, strong-minded </p><p>man".  End note) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S/NF) Kabariti suggested that "the King needs more </p><p>time" to learn how to govern, and said that all Abdullah </p><p>wanted, before the passing of King Hussein, was to be head of </p><p>the Army--"That was his long-term dream; he has never been </p><p>groomed to be King".  But he said that "the Queen adds to his </p><p>insecurity as she does not trust any one."  He added that </p><p>"she is the last one to whisper in his ear" on most matters. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S/NF) In response to the Ambassador\'s question on </p><p>possible timing of Parliamentary elections, Kabariti said he </p><p>thought they would not take place before May or June of 2003. </p><p> Surprisingly, he said that such timing "was okay".  Although </p><p>he was convinced that the King could "manage" elections if </p><p>they were held in autumn as has been widely speculated, the </p><p>King could move the date back without much political damage. </p><p>Kabariti said the King was not afraid of the results of the </p><p>poll; rather, the Court "wanted to rule without </p><p>accountability to Parliament".  Pointing to his own </p><p>experience as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of </p><p>the House of Representatives, Kabariti said "one can always </p><p>make deals in politics, even with the Muslim Brotherhood", </p><p>whose support he gained to pass the Peace Agreement with </p><p>Israel in 1994. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (S/NF) Returning to his earlier theme, he said the King </p><p>"should learn how to strike deals and build an instinct to </p><p>trust on political terms".  He said that with or without </p><p>elections, the government has to "bring the internal </p><p>political situation along".  Kabariti forcefully stated that </p><p>"vision without leadership is fatal; leadership without </p><p>vision even more fatal".  He said the King must take </p><p>political issues on, even if "he is not willing to suffer" </p><p>through the business of politics. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>ECONOMY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Kabariti opined the economy was "doing very well". </p><p> He said he thought the growth over the last five years had </p><p>been "phenomenal" given the tensions in the region.  He </p><p>endorsed the Ambassador\'s comment that it was imperative that </p><p>more people in the Kingdom feel the benefits of economic </p><p>growth, but restated his earlier supposition that had it not </p><p>been for the current economic situation, Jordan would not be </p><p>able to "handle" the Palestinian issue.  Kabariti warmly </p><p>thanked Ambassador for American aid and support.  He said </p><p>that the growth in exports to the U.S. should be a sign to </p><p>Jordanians that opening up to American interests has "very </p><p>obvious benefits". </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>BANKING SCANDAL </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (S/NF) Seconding the Ambassador\'s observation that the </p><p>banking system rode out the recent loan scandal (REF C), </p><p>Kabariti said that alleged perpetrator Majed al-Shemaileh </p><p>chose the banks that he dealt with very carefully.  He said </p><p>that Shemaileh "picked older banks, managed by </p><p>decision-makers who were easily bribed", and avoided </p><p>"professional" banks whose loan criteria would not have </p><p>permitted such activity.  He agreed that the Central Bank did </p><p>"very well", but that more accountability in the system was </p><p>clearly needed "if we are to survive" another such problem. </p><p>He said that money lost by the banks in the scandal, said to </p><p>be about $12 million, should be absorbed by the banks in two </p><p>to three years. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (S/NF) Kabariti noted the case of former head of </p><p>Jordanian Intelligence (GID) Samih al-Batikhi, whose assets </p><p>were seized during the course of the investigation and who </p><p>was alleged by press reports to have been part of the scandal </p><p>(REF B), allegations that have not yet been publicly put to </p><p>rest.  He said he reminded the King that Batikhi had been </p><p>instrumental in safeguarding both his father\'s regime, as </p><p>well as his own.  He said that if Batikhi wanted money, there </p><p>were many other ways he could have got it; he could have had </p><p>$15 million from Kuwait, $50 million from Saddam, or even $10 </p><p>million from the Libyans.  Kabariti said in the course of </p><p>trying to organize the Court finances during his tenure as </p><p>Chief of the Royal Court (from March 1999 to January 2000), </p><p>he discovered the King was "hiding some of Court\'s funds with </p><p>Batikhi".  Kabariti said he reminded the King of this during </p><p>a "very frank discussion".  Kabariti said that after he saw </p><p>what happened to Batikhi, he would never return to politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>WE WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU IN THE COLD </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (S/NF) At the conclusion of the discussion, Kabariti </p><p>returned to the subject of Iraq.  He said that, given his </p><p>trade and oil dealings with Iraq, the PM will never be able </p><p>to give a forceful message to the Jordanians explaining the </p><p>need for regime change.  He said he was aware of American </p><p>assurances to Jordan that "we will never leave you in the </p><p>cold" should some interruption of Iraqi oil shipments take </p><p>place.  He said the message to Jordan from the U.S. should be </p><p>"Don\'t tell me about $250 million (the value of Iraqi oil </p><p>exports to Jordan).  We gave you $500 million!"  Kabariti </p><p>added that the recent Paris Club agreement would not have </p><p>been secured without the help of the USG, implying that </p><p>getting this story out would help as well. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (S/NF) A passionate, patriotic man with strong opinions, </p><p>Kabariti is well known to the Embassy.  His extensive service </p><p>in government, under both the late King Hussein and King </p><p>Abdullah, gives him a unique and informed perspective on a </p><p>wide range of international, regional, and domestic issues. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
