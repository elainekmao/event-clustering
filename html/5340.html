Turgut </p><p>said TGS was meeting with the MFA and he expected MFA would </p><p>contact USG this week to discuss the MOU and the way ahead </p><p>(note: although Turgut said he thought it would be this week, </p><p>he did not sound confident in his response.  end note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
