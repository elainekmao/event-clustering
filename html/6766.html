<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 000513 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  3-26-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, PINS, CE, NO, JA, CH, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Peace process update:  More re sinking of </p><p>Chinese fishing boat; Tamil leader takes on the LTTE </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 251820Z Mar 03 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) FBIS Reston Va DTG 251313Z Mar 03 </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 485 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 381 </p><p>-      (E) Colombo 261 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Sri Lanka\'s peace process reviews </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>>> Sinking of Chinese fishing boat still under </p><p>investigation, but Tigers look more-and-more like the </p><p>culprits </p><p> </p><p>>> In brave but dangerous move, Tamil leader hits out at </p><p>the Tigers </p><p> </p><p>>> Unconfirmed reports that the Tigers are killing </p><p>opponents </p><p> </p><p>>> Alliance between major Opposition grouping and </p><p>radical JVP close, but no agreement yet on how to handle </p><p>peace process </p><p> </p><p>>> Latest poll indicates strong public support for the </p><p>peace process </p><p> </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p>More on Sinking of Chinese Boat </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Sri Lankan government and the peace process </p><p>monitors continue to investigate the March 20 attack on </p><p>a Chinese fishing trawler off the northeastern coast of </p><p>Sri Lanka.  (Note:  Seventeen crewmen, Chinese and Sri </p><p>Lankan, are believed to have died in the incident. </p><p>Ref C reviews the incident in additional detail.)  The </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) organization has </p><p>been accused of perpetrating the attack, although the </p><p>group continues to deny any involvement.  The Sri Lankan </p><p>government has stated that it has now recovered the </p><p>bodies of seven victims, and is continuing its search </p><p>operations for the rest who are missing and presumed </p><p>dead.  In addition, the GSL has released a press </p><p>statement condemning the "unprovoked" attack (without </p><p>mentioning the LTTE) (Ref B).  For its part, China -- </p><p>per Ref A statement by the Chinese MFA -- continues to </p><p>demand a full-and-complete investigation into the </p><p>incident. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In the meantime, the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM) expects to present its </p><p>findings re the incident to the GSL and LTTE on </p><p>March 28.  A public statement by the SLMM will be </p><p>released two or three days later.  When pressed, SLMM </p><p>Spokesman Teitor Torkelson told us that the monitors </p><p>could not confirm that the LTTE sunk the boat.  That </p><p>said, based on the totality of the evidence, the SLMM </p><p>strongly believes the LTTE is responsible.  He expects </p><p>that the SLMM\'s forthcoming press release will implicate </p><p>the LTTE without directly assigning blame. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  The sinking of the vessel remains </p><p>mysterious.  All indications are that the LTTE did </p><p>indeed attack and sink the fishing trawler, but there is </p><p>no apparent rationale for the group doing so.  The LTTE </p><p>has no bone to pick with China, and the group has not </p><p>attacked fishing boats, in general, in the past.  As </p><p>reported in Ref C, however, the Sea Tigers (the LTTE\'s </p><p>"navy") appear to be on a hair trigger following recent </p><p>confrontations with the Sri Lankan navy and it is </p><p>possible they are lashing out.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p>Tamil Leader Hits Out at LTTE </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a courageous, but potentially dangerous move, </p><p>senior Tamil leader V. Anandasangaree has publicly hit </p><p>out at the LTTE.  Anandasangaree, head of the Tamil </p><p>United Liberation Front (TULF) and a senior MP, stated </p><p>publicly on March 23 that he does not accept the LTTE\'s </p><p>claim to be "the sole representative of the Tamil </p><p>people."  (Note:  Anandasangaree has often voiced </p><p>similar opinions about the LTTE to Mission personnel </p><p>during private conversations in the past, but this is </p><p>the first time he has opened up in public.)  He went on </p><p>to complain that the LTTE would not permit the TULF to </p><p>commemorate the life and works of its former leader, A. </p><p>Amirthalingam, who was assassinated by the LTTE in July </p><p>1989 in Colombo. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In addition to Anandasangaree, a second TULF MP </p><p>from Jaffna, N. Raviraj, appears to be trying to </p><p>distance himself from the LTTE.  Referring to a recent </p><p>announcement that there might be local elections in the </p><p>north and east (Ref A), Raviraj announced publicly on </p><p>March 24 that he might run independently of the Tamil </p><p>National Alliance (TNA) (apparently for the job of mayor </p><p>of Jaffna, a post which he formerly held).  (Note:  The </p><p>TNA is composed of four generally pro-LTTE Tamil </p><p>parties, including the TULF, which is its major </p><p>constituent element.  Most members of the TNA are pro- </p><p>LTTE.)  (Note:  The Ambassador is scheduled to meet with </p><p>Raviraj next week and will get his take on the situation </p><p>at that time.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  Anandasangaree\'s decision to criticize </p><p>the LTTE in public is a brave one.  His comments may </p><p>have been prompted by the LTTE\'s recent decision not to </p><p>permit the reopening of Jaffna\'s Library (Ref E).  This </p><p>decision upset Ananadasangaree and other Tamils, who had </p><p>worked long-and-hard to reopen the cultural landmark. </p><p>In any case, Anandasangaree\'s decision to go public is a </p><p>potentially dangerous one, as highlighted by what </p><p>happened to Amirthalingam (see above) and what may be </p><p>happening to other opponents of the LTTE (see below). </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p>LTTE Reportedly Kills Opponents </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) In other news regarding the LTTE and the Tamil </p><p>community-at-large, the past week has seen multiple </p><p>unconfirmed reports of the LTTE assassinating, </p><p>intimidating, and abducting mainly Tamil opponents.  On </p><p>March 18, for example, a former soldier in the Sri </p><p>Lankan army of Tamil ethnicity was killed in Mount </p><p>Lavinia, a city located just south of Colombo.  Despite </p><p>reports claiming that the killing was carried out by the </p><p>LTTE (which, as usual, denies involvement), there has </p><p>been no confirmation of who perpetrated the killing.  In </p><p>the meantime, additional allegations involving the LTTE </p><p>have recently surfaced and include: </p><p> </p><p>-- The LTTE allegedly assassinating numerous government </p><p>intelligence sources during the past year; </p><p> </p><p>-- A recent attempt to deliver a letter bomb to a </p><p>military informant, which exploded and injured several </p><p>people (but not the intended victim); </p><p> </p><p>-- Reported use of intimidation and violence to prevent </p><p>civilians from reporting LTTE-related incidents to the </p><p>SLMM; and, </p><p> </p><p>-- Continued abduction/disappearances of LTTE opponents. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  Mission is looking into this uptick in </p><p>reports of egregious human rights violations by the </p><p>LTTE, especially the reports that they are killing </p><p>opponents.  (Note:  FYI.  Anandasangaree, in a recent </p><p>conversation with the Ambassador, asserted that the LTTE </p><p>was involved in many killings of Tamil opponents.)  Many </p><p>of the reports seem murky, however, and are difficult to </p><p>confirm.  It is also not clear whether the government is </p><p>investigating the cases fully. (Note:  Some suspect that </p><p>the government is not pressing the cases because it </p><p>feels that to do so might jeopardize the peace process, </p><p>or perhaps because Tamil witnesses do not want to </p><p>cooperate.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p>PA and JVP near Alliance </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The People\'s Alliance (PA), the main Opposition </p><p>grouping, and the radical Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) party continue their efforts to form an alliance. </p><p>As reported previously (see Ref D), the parties are </p><p>believed close to sealing a deal.  According to </p><p>contacts, however, one of the key issues dividing the </p><p>two parties is how to deal with the peace process. </p><p>Compared with the PA, the JVP is much, much more anti- </p><p>peace process and does not want to endorse the PA plan </p><p>for constitutional devolution sent to Parliament by </p><p>President Kumaratunga, the PA leader, in August 2000. </p><p>(Note:  The plan was not approved by Parliament at that </p><p>time.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) COMMENT:  It is understandable that the </p><p>historical differences between the two parties re the </p><p>peace process may create some difficulty in coming to a </p><p>compromise.  The JVP has vociferously opposed any </p><p>agreement that devolves any power to the north and east. </p><p>The PA, on the other hand, has had a moderate approach </p><p>to the peace process for quite some time (although some </p><p>PA elements have taken a more critical stance of late). </p><p>While overcoming differences may be difficult, </p><p>indications are that the JVP and PA will find a way to </p><p>reach a compromise and forge an alliance in the coming </p><p>days, weeks, or months.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p>Public Supports Peace Process </p><p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  The latest poll figures continue to show </p><p>overwhelming support for the peace process.  The latest </p><p>edition of a poll by a well-respected local NGO (the </p><p>Center for Policy Alternatives) indicates that 83.7 </p><p>percent of the population supports the peace process. </p><p>Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement in February </p><p>2002, support for the process has remained relatively </p><p>stable at between about 83 and 87 percent.  Norwegian </p><p>facilitation of the talks also maintains a plurality of </p><p>support by a substantial margin (with neutral or unknown </p><p>response receiving substantial numbers).  The SLMM, </p><p>however, is seen as being impartial and effective by </p><p>only a small plurality of the populace.  According to </p><p>the poll\'s results, the Tamil-speaking community is much </p><p>more pro-SLMM than the majority Sinhalese community. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) COMMENT:  Despite recent, strident criticism </p><p>from some in the south aimed at the peace process, the </p><p>latest poll confirms our sense that the public-at-large </p><p>continues to support the ceasefire and discussions with </p><p>the LTTE.  The United National Party (UNP) government, </p><p>which has problems in such areas as the economy, is </p><p>clearly benefiting from this support, as it sees its </p><p>popular standing buoyed by its management of peace- </p><p>related issues.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
