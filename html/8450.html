<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 AMMAN 003242 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM AND NEA; PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, KPAL, KWBG, EAID, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: UNRWA MAY 21-22 DONORS MEETING:  BUDGET </p><p>SHORTFALLS, WEST BANK AND GAZA WOES, AND CONTINUING US </p><p>EFFORTS ON TEXTBOOKS AND TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEL AVIV 2916 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary:  UNRWA\'s May 21-22 meeting of major donors </p><p>and host governments revealed an agency in an atypically </p><p>sound cash-flow position but troubled by overall budget </p><p>shortfalls and underfunded emergency needs in the West Bank </p><p>and Gaza, with only USD 25 million received against its </p><p>current USD 94 million emergency appeal.  UNRWA reported that </p><p>Israeli security restrictions in the West Bank and Gaza </p><p>continue to impede the agency\'s ability to provide basic </p><p>services and emergency humanitarian assistance.  In response </p><p>to donor requests for more technical discussions, UNRWA </p><p>updated donors on initiatives in the relief and social </p><p>services and education departments (including the US-funded </p><p>tolerance project), announcing that it had secured USD 5.6 </p><p>million in funding for its long-planned Palestine refugee </p><p>record project.  In meetings and a visit to Fawwar refugee </p><p>camp held on the margins of the UNRWA meeting, PRM PDAS </p><p>Greene briefed UNRWA and GOI officials on the US Government\'s </p><p>continuing efforts to balance humanitarian assistance, </p><p>stability and security needs in the Palestinian refugee </p><p>context.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) UNRWA held its semiannual meeting of major donors and </p><p>host governments May 21-22 in Amman.  The US Delegation </p><p>included Ambassador Gnehm, PRM PDAS Richard Greene, Regional </p><p>Refugee Coordinator and Refugee Assistant.  At the meeting, </p><p>Ambassador Gnehm announced an initial US contribution of USD </p><p>80 million to UNRWA\'s General Fund and a separate USD 15 </p><p>million contribution to UNRWA\'s emergency appeal. </p><p> </p><p>General Fund Finances:  Improved Cash-Flow but Funding Gap </p><p>Remains </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) UNRWA ComGen Hansen reported that the agency is in </p><p>its best cash-flow situation in recent years, due largely to </p><p>an early General Fund payment from the European Commission, </p><p>which previously made its payments at the end of the calendar </p><p>year.  Unexpected exchange rate gains, savings from </p><p>management reforms and a USD 4 million repayment of VAT owed </p><p>by the Palestinian Authority have also improved the agency\'s </p><p>financial posture.  Nevertheless, UNRWA still expects to face </p><p>a USD 55 million funding gap for calendar year 2003.  The US </p><p>and European Commission delegations asked UNRWA for a </p><p>qualitative assessment of the effects of the projected </p><p>funding gap and an explanation of how UNRWA prioritizes </p><p>programming in such circumstances.  Hansen responded that </p><p>reductions in maintenance spending and staff salaries (e.g., </p><p>the 1999 staff salary rules) bore the brunt of funding </p><p>shortfalls. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) PRM PDAS Greene asked whether UNRWA would consider </p><p>merging the West Bank and Gaza emergency programs into the </p><p>General Fund, eliciting a relatively spirited debate among </p><p>donors and host governments.  Hansen responded that the </p><p>agency would continue to need additional funds for emergency </p><p>programming in the West Bank and Gaza as long as the current </p><p>situation continued.  He added that the agency believed it </p><p>was easier for donors to respond to these needs if they </p><p>continued to be cast as extraordinary, extrabudgetary needs. </p><p>Several donors, including Australia, Sweden, Germany and </p><p>Norway noted that they have an easier time providing </p><p>emergency funding than convincing their parliaments to </p><p>increase annual General Fund contributions to UNRWA.  Syria </p><p>and Jordan expressed concern that inclusion of emergency West </p><p>Bank and Gaza programming in UNRWA\'s General Fund budget </p><p>could undercut support for Palestinians in UNRWA\'s other </p><p>three fields of operations. </p><p> </p><p>Impact of Chronic Underfunding </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Deputy ComGen Karen AbuZayd briefed donors on a study </p><p>conducted by UNRWA\'s Policy Analysis Unit, analyzing the </p><p>effects of an estimated USD 570 million in unfunded needs </p><p>since 1990.  Although UNRWA\'s annual income has increased by </p><p>24 percent since 1990, the Palestinian refugee population has </p><p>increased by 62 percent in the same period due largely to </p><p>spikes in UNRWA registration rolls following the 1990-1 Gulf </p><p>War and the Oslo peace accords.  UNRWA reports that due to </p><p>chronic underfunding, its spending per refugee has dropped </p><p>from USD 99 per refugee in 1990 to USD 73 per refugee in </p><p>2002.  Cost-cutting measures such as the 1999 area staff </p><p>rules (reducing UNRWA Palestinian staff salaries) have </p><p>doubled both the number of resignations per year and the </p><p>recruitment time required to fill vacant positions.  UNRWA </p><p>reported that chronic underfunding has had a significant, </p><p>negative impact on education programs, requiring </p><p>double-shifting in almost all schools in Jordan and Syria and </p><p>leaving UNRWA schools unable to keep up with local </p><p>educational norms, such as the introduction of computer </p><p>science classes.  Underfunding has also required UNRWA to </p><p>decrease its health expenditures (from USD 20 per refugee per </p><p>year in 1990 to a current USD 13 per refugee) and its relief </p><p>services, limiting special hardship cases to just six percent </p><p>of the refugee population, down from seven percent in 1990. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>West Bank and Gaza Emergency Programs -- Needs Remain Great, </p><p>Funds Remain Short </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Hansen characterized the current situation in the </p><p>West Bank and Gaza as "the most difficult in recent years." </p><p>150 Palestinian fatalities occurred in the first four months </p><p>of 2003, a 45 percent increase over the same period in the </p><p>last two years.  Hansen reported that 12,700 Palestinians </p><p>have become homeless since September 2000 due to Israeli home </p><p>demolitions with an "alarming" increase in demolitions in the </p><p>last three months.  According to the World Bank, 50 percent </p><p>of Palestinians in the West Bank live below the poverty line </p><p>while the number in Gaza reaches nearly 75 percent.  However, </p><p>poor donor response to UNRWA\'s emergency appeal -- a mere USD </p><p>25 million received of the USD 94 million requested -- has </p><p>hampered UNRWA\'s ability to respond to the crisis.  Hansen </p><p>said that limited funding has required UNRWA to reduce its </p><p>emergency food distributions and temporary jobs programs. </p><p>Separately, UNRWA West Bank Deputy Director Guy Sirri told </p><p>PRM PDAS Greene during a May 20 visit to Fawwar refugee camp </p><p>that UNRWA was forced to cancel 300 direct hire temporary </p><p>jobs on April 1, due to limited funding. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) UNRWA West Bank Director Richard Cook reported that </p><p>the effects of nearly 32 months of violence and growing </p><p>Palestinian poverty are increasingly obvious in UNRWA </p><p>schools.  (UNRWA began its presentation on West Bank and Gaza </p><p>emergency programming with a short film on an UNRWA student </p><p>injured at her school desk during clashes in Khan Younis </p><p>refugee camp.)  UNRWA teachers are reporting increasing signs </p><p>of psychological distress such as speech impediments, </p><p>bedwetting and psychosomatic problems.  Increasing numbers of </p><p>UNRWA schoolchildren are arriving at school hungry. </p><p>Children\'s classroom time continues to be cut short by </p><p>closures and curfews; Cook reported that UNRWA lost a total </p><p>of 82,000 staff days in 2002, an average of 1,000 staff days </p><p>per West Bank school.  West Bank Education Director Lamis </p><p>Alami separately told PDAS Greene during a May 20 camp visit </p><p>that only 28 percent of UNRWA\'s West Bank schools met the </p><p>minimum requirement of being open for a full 200 working days </p><p>during the 2001-2 school year.  Alami added that although </p><p>test scores are falling, UNRWA can only hold back five </p><p>percent of its students per year due to limited classroom </p><p>space.  Cook told donors that academic performance is worst </p><p>in schools that have been hardest hit by violence.  In </p><p>UNRWA\'s Tulkarm schools, for example, only 27 percent of </p><p>students achieved a passing score on recent Arabic language </p><p>tests, compared to 75 percent of students in nearby NurShams </p><p>camp, which has been relatively isolated from the violence. </p><p> </p><p>Access Difficulties Continue in West Bank and Gaza </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Hansen told donors that UNRWA continues to experience </p><p>severe access difficulties, with 124 of 151 recent access </p><p>problems in the West Bank and Gaza involving UNRWA staff. </p><p>New Israeli restrictions on international staff movement in </p><p>and out of Gaza (ref) were particularly difficult for the </p><p>agency.  Hansen told donors that UNRWA had accrued USD 20 </p><p>million in direct or indirect losses due to closures and </p><p>other Israeli security measures implemented since September </p><p>2000. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) West Bank Director Cook reported that the new IDF </p><p>liaison system for humanitarian agencies had not resulted in </p><p>access improvements on the ground.  Cook cited the April 2003 </p><p>occupation of UNRWA\'s Tulkarm girls school, the May 2003 </p><p>shooting of an UNRWA bus driver in Deir Ammar, and several </p><p>separate incidents in which IDF soldiers at checkpoints held </p><p>guns to the heads of UNRWA international staff members as a </p><p>few examples of deteriorating operating conditions for UNRWA </p><p>staff.  Cook told donors that he believes the IDF\'s failure </p><p>to hold individual soldiers responsible for their actions is </p><p>largely responsible for UNRWA\'s growing access problems. </p><p>Cook added that the Israeli government\'s security wall will </p><p>worsen UNRWA\'s access problems.  21 UNRWA installations, </p><p>including the West Bank field\'s sole hospital at Qalqiliya, </p><p>will be completely isolated by the wall. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) PRM PDAS Greene noted that the US has raised access </p><p>issues with the Israeli Government since the onset of the </p><p>current difficulties and would continue to do so.  However, </p><p>it is important for donors and host governments to remember </p><p>the context of the current situation; closures and other </p><p>Israeli security measures are implemented in response to </p><p>terrorist attacks.  Five suicide bombings in the 48 hours </p><p>preceding the UNRWA meeting cannot be forgotten or ignored. </p><p>Hansen agreed, telling donors that Jordanian Foreign Minister </p><p>Muasher\'s opening remarks regarding the need for a political </p><p>solution to end the violence, including immediate </p><p>implementation of the Quartet\'s roadmap, set the tone for the </p><p>larger context in which UNRWA issues should be considered. </p><p> </p><p>Technical Sessions and Workshops </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) In response to donor requests for more technical </p><p>discussions in the semiannual meetings, UNRWA\'s Directors of </p><p>Relief and Social Services (RSS) and Education presented </p><p>separate briefings on new initiatives in their departments. </p><p>Replicating last spring\'s successful workshop model, UNRWA </p><p>also held smaller discussions on its Neirab/Ein Al Tal </p><p>rehousing project, its emergency programming priorities and </p><p>access issues.  RSS Director Beth Kuttab announced that UNRWA </p><p>had secured USD 5.6 million in funding for its long-planned </p><p>Palestine refugee records project, enabling the agency to </p><p>simultaneously update its registration system and preserve </p><p>the 1948 refugees\' original documentation.  The United </p><p>Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Saudi Arabia and the ruler of </p><p>Sharja pledged money to the project.  Education Director </p><p>Kabir Shaikh updated donors on the US- and German-funded </p><p>tolerance education projects, announcing that 80 schools in </p><p>five fields were participating in the projects on a pilot </p><p>basis, involving 587 staff and 42,000 students.  Shaikh also </p><p>announced that the UK\'s Quality Assurance Project had been </p><p>implemented in 376 schools.  The Syrian delegation noted that </p><p>all new UNRWA education initiatives must be closely </p><p>coordinated with host governments, as UNRWA schools are </p><p>obliged to follow host governments\' curricula. </p><p> </p><p>Textbooks and Terrorism:  Bilateral Meetings with Israeli and </p><p>UNRWA Officials on Margins of Meeting </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) In separate meetings held on the margins of the </p><p>donors meeting and in Israel prior to the meeting, PRM PDAS </p><p>Greene briefed UNRWA and GOI officials on the US Government\'s </p><p>continuing efforts to balance humanitarian assistance, </p><p>stability and security needs in the Palestinian refugee </p><p>context.  He assured GOI Legal Adviser Alan Baker on May 20 </p><p>that the USG was working to ensure that UNRWA was taking </p><p>"every possible measure" to ensure its programs and </p><p>installations remain free from outside influences and that </p><p>its beneficiaries have not engaged in terrorism.  Baker </p><p>responded that the GOI continues to be troubled by the very </p><p>public, political positions taken by UNRWA ComGen Peter </p><p>Hansen.  Hansen\'s published articles, "critical of Israel," </p><p>are a negative influence on GOI officials responsible for </p><p>dealing with UNRWA.  On the more serious charges of UNRWA </p><p>complicity in terrorism, Baker said that he "doesn\'t know" </p><p>whether UNRWA is actively preventing armed activity in West </p><p>Bank and Gaza refugee camps.  He explained that, in the </p><p>aftermath of his very public criticism alleging UNRWA </p><p>complicity several months ago, he had not been following the </p><p>issue very closely. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Baker also asserted that UNRWA is not undertaking </p><p>activities to reduce incitement in its schools.  He told </p><p>Greene that incitement is an integral part of terrorism that </p><p>must be addressed by all parties providing assistance to the </p><p>Palestinians, including UNRWA.  (During a May 20 visit to </p><p>Fawwar refugee camp, UNRWA West Bank officials told Greene </p><p>that the agency works successfully to keep political </p><p>materials out of its installations but has a difficult time </p><p>keeping them off outside walls.  Some exterior walls of UNRWA </p><p>installations in Fawwar camp, for example, were spray-painted </p><p>with Hamas graffiti.) </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) In a May 21 meeting, UNRWA ComGen Hansen and </p><p>Deputy ComGen AbuZayd told Greene that UNRWA continues to </p><p>take seriously the charges of incitement in Palestinian </p><p>textbooks and has begun its own internal review of PA </p><p>textbooks.  The agency also continues to implement the </p><p>US-funded tolerance project, viewing it as an important </p><p>supplementary teaching tool.  Hansen and AbuZayd assured </p><p>Greene that UNRWA "never" resorted to public statements </p><p>critical of Israel as a first approach to problem solving; </p><p>they asserted that UNRWA issued public statements only in </p><p>"grave situations," where UNRWA had been unable to resolve </p><p>differences via quiet diplomatic channels.  AbuZayd also told </p><p>Greene that UNRWA welcomed the imminent US General Accounting </p><p>Office (GAO) investigation of UNRWA programs and procedures </p><p>and was eager to facilitate the GAO\'s work. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) PRM PDAS Greene, ConGen Jerusalem and Embassy Tel </p><p>Aviv cleared this message. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
