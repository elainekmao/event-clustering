<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 03020 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP EXCLUSIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  SYRIAN CLOSURE OF ABU NIDAL OFFICES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) FBIS AMMAN JO 040709Z JUN 87 </p><p>--    B)  LINO/GREENE TELECON JUNE 4, 1987 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP SOME -- BUT </p><p>NOT YET CONCLUSIVE -- CONFIRMATION THAT THE SYRIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO END THE "OFFICIAL" ABU NIDAL </p><p>PRESENCE IN SYRIA.  THE THREE OFFICES IN DAMASCUS APPEAR </p><p>CLOSED.  WHILE THE SYRIAN JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ACTION </p><p>MAY WELL BE ANGER OVER ABU NIDAL\'S DALLIANCE WITH ARAFAT </p><p>IN ALGIERS, THE REAL REASONS SEEM TO BE ANO-SYRIAN </p><p>CONFRONTATION IN LEBANON AND WESTERN PRESSURES.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  POST HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH SOME, BUT AS YET </p><p>INCONCLUSIVE, CONFIRMATION OF "JORDAN TIMES" ARTICLE </p><p>(REFTEL A) THAT SARG HAS FINALLY MOVED TO END THE </p><p>ANO PRESENCE IN SYRIA.  DATT HAS SURVEYED THE THREE </p><p>IDENTIFIED ABU NIDAL OFFICES IN DAMASCUS.  AS OF JUNE 4, </p><p>SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS OUTSIDE THE PRESS OFFICE AND THE ANO </p><p>HEADQUARTERS IN DAMASCUS PROPER HAVE BEEN REMOVED (THESE </p><p>CAMERAS HAD BEEN PRESENT JUNE 3).  THE GUARD FORCE </p><p>NORMALLY PRESENT OUTSIDE BOTH LOCATIONS HAD ALSO BEEN </p><p>MOVED AS OF JUNE 4, AND REGULAR SYRIAN POLICE CARS, </p><p>NEVER PREVIOUSLY SEEN AT THE HEADQUARTERS LOCATION, WERE </p><p>PARKED IN FRONT.  FOLLOW-UP SURVEY ON JUNE 5 FOUND THE </p><p>OFFICES APPARENTLY DESERTED.  LOCAL AP CORRESPONDENT TOLD </p><p>POLOFF JUNE 4 THAT HE HAD VISITED THE ANO HEADQUARTERS </p><p>THAT MORNING AND FOUND THEM OCCUPIED BY "ALI DUBA\'S </p><p>MEN" WHO WERE TEARING POSTERS OFF THE WALLS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AP CORRESPONDENT INSISTS THE STORY IS TRUE, AND THAT </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN ORDERED TO VACATE </p><p>SYRIA COMPLETELY.  HE ASSERTS ALSO THAT THE TRAINING </p><p>CAMPS IN THE BIQA\' HAVE BEEN CLOSED.  (THE SOURCE </p><p>REMINDED US THAT HE HAD MADE THE LATTER CLAIM A WEEK </p><p>AGO.)  PNSF CHAIRMAN KHALID AL-FAHOUM ALSO CONFIRMED THIS </p><p>STORY TO THE ITALIAN COUNSELOR ON THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 4, </p><p>AS DID A "FORMER SENIOR MFA OFFICIAL" TO A NUMBER OF </p><p>OTHER WESTERN DIPLOMATS (WEST GERMAN CHARGE SAYS THE </p><p>SOURCE WAS MOHAMMED SAKARIAN ISMAIL). </p><p> </p><p>5.  ON JUNE 4 AND 5, MISSION OFFICERS CALLED ON AUSTRIAN, </p><p>BRITISH, DUTCH, FRENCH, GERMAN, CANADIAN, SPANISH, </p><p>ITALIAN AND YUGOSLAV COLLEAGUES.  DATT CONTACTED HIS </p><p>CHINESE AND AUSTRALIAN COUNTERPARTS.  THE AUSTRIANS, </p><p>SPANISH, AND ITALIANS CLAIM TO HAVE SOME CONFIRMATION. </p><p>ALL OUR CONTACTS PROMISED TO FOLLOW UP WITH LOCAL </p><p>PALESTINIAN SOURCES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND TO GET </p><p>BACK TO US.  (ARAB EMBASSIES IN DAMASCUS WERE CLOSED </p><p>FRIDAY, JUNE 5.  WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THEM OVER THE </p><p>WEEKEND.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  PHYSICALLY, THE ANO OFFICES APPEAR SHUT </p><p>DOWN.  THEIR STATUS HAS GREATLY CHANGED FROM THE DATT\'S </p><p>LAST RECONNAISSANCE.  THE SYRIANS HAVE BEEN TELLING US, </p><p>AS WELL AS THE REST OF OUR DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES, THAT ABU </p><p>NIDAL\'S ORGANIZATION HAD LEFT SYRIA, WITH THE EXCEPTION </p><p>OF THE FRONT OFFICES WHICH WERE MANNED BY LOW LEVEL </p><p>PERSONNEL, FOR SOME TIME.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE "JORDAN </p><p>TIMES" STORY JUNE 4, MFA EUROPEAN DIRECTOR SULAYMAN HADDAD </p><p>QUIPPED THAT "THE AMERICANS SPEND MILLIONS ON THEIR CIA </p><p>AND YET THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GRASP THE FACT </p><p>THAT ABU NIDAL IS GONE."  FAHOUM AND DFLP AND PFLP </p><p>LEADERS HAVE ALSO BEEN INSISTING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF </p><p>THE YEAR THAT, OTHER THAN THE TOKEN PRESENCE OF THE </p><p>OFFICES, THAT THE ANO HAD LEFT SYRIA, FIRST FOR LEBANON </p><p>AND THEN TO LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT CONTINUED.  THE INFORMAL BUT OFFICIAL JUSTIFI </p><p>CATION FOR THE FINAL SYMBOLIC GESTURE OF CLOSING THE </p><p>OFFICES IS ABU NIDAL\'S DEALINGS WITH ARAFAT IN ALGIERS. </p><p>ONE LOCAL SOURCE TELLS US THAT ABU NIDAL REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>MISREPRESENTED THE DISCUSSIONS TO THE SYRIANS FOLLOWING </p><p>THEIR DEPARTURE FROM ALGIERS.  THE AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR </p><p>POINTS OUT, HOWEVER (AND WE AGREE), THAT THE SAME </p><p>JUSTIFICATION SHOULD APPLY MORE APPROPRIATELY TO THE </p><p>DFLP, PFLP, PCP AND OTHERS WHO PARTICIPATED FULLY IN </p><p>THE PNC.  MORE LIKELY, THE SYRIANS HAVE GROWN INCREASING- </p><p>LY IRRITATED BY THE ANO\'S ACTIVE OPPOSITION TO SYRIAN </p><p>EFFORTS TO END THE ARMED PALESTINIAN PRESENCE IN </p><p>LEBANON AND THE SYRIAN MILITARY OCCUPATION OF WEST </p><p>BEIRUT.  DAMASCUS, TOO, IS ANXIOUS TO RELIEVE WESTERN </p><p>PRESSURE REGARDING TERRORISM AND MAY AT LAST  HAVE </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT THE MAINTENANCE OF WHAT THEY INSIST IS A </p><p>TOKEN POLITICAL PRESENCE IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LINO </p><p></p></div>
