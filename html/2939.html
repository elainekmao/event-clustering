END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY BOLOGNA CENTER, UNIVERSITY </p><p>OF BOLOGNA (UB) FACULTY OF LAW\'S CENTER FOR CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>STUDIES AND DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT, AND UB\'S "KING ABDULAZIZ" </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF ISLAMIC STUDIES SPONSORED A </p><p>CONFERENCE IN BOLOGNA MAY 3-4.  ENTITLED, "STRATEGIES FOR THE </p><p>FUTURE OF NORTH AFRICA: THE CHANGING DIMENSIONS OF LAW, </p><p>POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND CIVIL SOCIETY," THE MEETING </p><p>BROUGHT TOGETHER ACADEMICIANS, PRACTITIONERS, DIPLOMATS, AND </p><p>STUDENTS FOR A CLOSE LOOK AT A REGION THAT HAS RESISTED THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION TREND THAT HAS SWEPT OVER EASTERN EUROPE AND </p><p>LATIN AMERICA.  THE MOST PROMINENT SPEAKER WAS WILLIAM </p><p>QUANDT, VICE PROVOST FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND FORMER NSC STAFF MEMBER UNDER THE </p><p>NIXON AND CARTER ADMINISTRATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING REPORT IS A </p><p>COMPILATION OF THE VIEWS EXPRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>FACTORS IMPEDING DEMOCRACY IN NORTH AFRICA--OR NOT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>3.  TRIBALISM.  IN ARAB SOCIETIES, PARTICULARLY BEDOUIN ONES, </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SOLIDARITY AND POWER HAS TRADITIONALLY </p><p>BEEN RELATED TO FAMILY AND TRIBAL GROUPINGS.  MEMBERS OF </p><p>POWERFUL FAMILIES OR TRIBES BENEFIT FROM THIS UNDEMOCRATIC </p><p>SYSTEM AND HAVE LITTLE INCENTIVE TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT </p><p>APPLIES THE LAWS EQUALLY TO EVERYONE.  IN THIS CONTEXT, A </p><p>FORM OF DEMOCRACY THAT PROVIDED FOR SOME POWER SHARING ALONG </p><p>TRIBAL LINES MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE ANTI-COLONIAL LEGACY.  MOST OF THE LEADERS AND ELITES </p><p>IN NORTH AFRICA ARE VETERANS OF THE BITTER STRUGGLE AGAINST </p><p>EUROPEAN COLONIALISM.  THE CONSTITUTIONS THEY WROTE WERE </p><p>PRIMARILY INTENDED TO EMPOWER THEIR STATES TO FIGHT THE </p><p>COLONIAL POWER.  CITIZENS\' RIGHTS WERE SECONDARY. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY ITSELF WAS CONSIDERED </p><p>HYPOCRITICAL BECAUSE IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES WHOSE BEHAVIOR IN NORTH AFRICA TOOK LITTLE ACCOUNT </p><p>OF THE POPULATIONS\' WISHES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MILITARISM.  THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT HAS BEEN USED AS </p><p>AN EXCUSE TO POSTPONE DEMOCRACY.  IT IS TRUE, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>ARAB GOVERNMENTS HAVE STRENGTHENED THEIR MILITARIES IN ORDER </p><p>TO DEFEND THEIR INTERESTS AGAINST A HEAVILY MILITARIZED </p><p>ISRAEL.  THESE MILITARIES HAVE EITHER SEIZED POWER AND </p><p>MAINTAINED DICTATORSHIPS OR DEFENDED AUTOCRATIC MONARCHIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  RENTIER STATES.  THE PROMINENT ROLE THAT OIL AND GAS PLAY </p><p>IN THE ECONOMIES OF ALGERIA AND LIBYA MAKE THEM "RENTIER </p><p>STATES."  IN EGYPT, U.S. AID CAUSES A SIMILAR EFFECT.  SINCE </p><p>TAXES PAID BY CITIZENS DO NOT FILL GOVERNMENT COFFERS, THE </p><p>PUBLIC HAS LITTLE LEVERAGE TO DEMAND GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS.  THE RESULT IS OFTEN </p><p>CORRUPTION AND ABUSE OF CITIZENS\' RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  FEAR OF ISLAMIST GOVERNMENT.  BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL </p><p>ACTORS FEAR THAT ISLAMISTS COULD INCREASE THEIR INFLUENCE </p><p>THROUGH AN EXPANSION OF FREEDOM OR DEMOCRACY.  WHEN ALGERIA\'S </p><p>ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT (FIS) SWEPT FIRST-ROUND ELECTIONS IN </p><p>1991, NOT ONLY THE ARMY BUT ALSO COMPONENTS OF CIVIL SOCIETY </p><p>DECIDED TO ANNUL THE RESULTS.  THE THEORY WAS THAT THE FIS </p><p>WOULD NOT HOLD DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS IN THE FUTURE, DESPITE </p><p>THEIR ASSURANCES.  TODAY WESTERN GOVERNMENTS ARE LESS AFRAID </p><p>OF ISLAMIST RULE THAN THEY WERE IN 1991, AND THE CIVIL WAR </p><p>THAT THE ANNULMENT SPARKED HAS MADE MANY PEOPLE RECONSIDER </p><p>HOW BAD FIS RUL WOULD REALLY HAVE BEEN. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ISLAM.  ONE SPEAKER STATED THAT THERE IS NO FULLY </p><p>DEMOCRATIC STATE WITH A MAJORITY MUSLIM POPULATION ANYWHERE. </p><p>NOTE:  SENEGAL IS AN EXCEPTION.  END NOTE.  HOWEVER, THIS </p><p>LACK OF DEMOCRACY CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO RELIGION.  NOTHING </p><p>IN ISLAMIC TEXTS IS UNFAVORABLE TO DEMOCRACY, NOR IS ANYTHING </p><p>IN CHRISTIAN TEXTS FAVORABLE TO DEMOCRACY.  INTERPRETATION </p><p>AND PRACTICE ARE KEY.  SINCE MANY NON-MUSLIM COUNTRIES ARE </p><p>ALSO UNDEMOCRATIC, OTHER FACTORS MUST EXPLAIN THE LACK OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  FURTHERMORE, AT ONE TIME, THE LACK OF DEMOCRACY </p><p>IN PLACES LIKE LATIN AMERICA AND FASCIST SPAIN AND ITALY WAS </p><p>ATTRIBUTED TO CATHOLIC CULTURE.  HISTORY HAS PROVEN THAT THE </p><p>"PATRIARCHAL"--EVEN "DICTATORIAL"--NATURE OF CATHOLICISM DOES </p><p>NOT IMPEDE DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  CULTURE.  MANY WESTERNERS BELIEVE THAT ARAB CULTURE MUST </p><p>BE INIMICAL TO DEMOCRACY, BUT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DEMOCRATIC </p><p>VALUES ARE EQUALLY WIDESPREAD AMONG MUSLIMS AND WESTERNERS. </p><p>SURVEY DATA SHOW SIMILAR ATTITUDES AMONG MUSLIMS AND </p><p>WESTERNERS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND </p><p>PRACTICES, PREFERENCE FOR STRONG LEADERS, AND THE ROLE OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE POLITICAL ARENA. </p><p> </p><p>ISLAM, PATRIARCHY, AND DICTATORSHIP: DIVERGENT VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>10.  SO DOES IT MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO PROSPECTS FOR DEMOCRACY </p><p>THAT ARAB CULTURE IS LARGELY PATRIARCHAL AND THAT </p><p>SHARI\'A-BASED FAMILY LAW CODES DISCRIMINATE AGAINST WOMEN IN </p><p>MATTERS OF INHERITANCE AND JUDICIAL TESTIMONY?  THIS WAS THE </p><p>MOST CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT AT THE CONFERENCE.  SOME SCHOLARS </p><p>STATED THAT SINCE THE FAMILY IS THE BASIC UNIT OF SOCIETY, </p><p>THE AUTHORITARIAN FAMILY MODEL--IN WHICH THE HUSBAND IS </p><p>UNQUESTIONABLE--CONDITIONS CITIZENS TO ACCEPT DICTATORSHIP. </p><p>HOWEVER, OTHERS NOTED THAT WOMEN\'S LIBERATION IS NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY A PREREQUISITE FOR DEMOCRACY.  IN THE WEST, </p><p>DEMOCRACY WAS INTRODUCED (ALBEIT IN A LIMITED FORM) BEFORE </p><p>WOMEN WERE ENFRANCHISED.  FINALLY, DESPITE THE COMMON </p><p>STEREOTYPES, ARAB WOMEN ARE NEITHER POWERLESS IN THE FAMILY </p><p>NOR NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO ISLAMIST PARTIES AND CAUSES. </p><p> </p><p>MULTI-PARTY DEMOCRACY NOT NECESSARY THE IDEAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  A PARTY-LESS OR WEAK PARTY SYSTEM MAY ACTUALLY BE </p><p>PREFERABLE TO A MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM, SINCE THE HEAD OF STATE </p><p>IS LESS ABLE TO DOMINATE THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH CONTROL BY </p><p>HIS OWN PARTY.  INSTEAD OF PROMOTING PARTY DEVELOPMENT IN A </p><p>TOP-HEAVY SYSTEM, INTERNAL ACTORS NEED TO CREATE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES THAT PROVIDE FOR INDEPENDENCE OR </p><p>CHECKS AND BALANCES BETWEEN THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>HOW DONORS WASTE MONEY IN NORTH AFRICA </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p></p><p>12.  DONORS HAVE GIVEN LITTLE ATTENTION TO DEMOCRATIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH AFRICA.  MOST OF THE FOREIGN AID GIVEN </p><p>GOES TO EGYPT\'S MILITARY.  SPEAKERS RECOMMENDED THAT THE USG </p><p>INCREASE ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEMOCRATIZATION PROJECTS AND </p><p>REDUCE MILITARY AID.  HUMAN RIGHTS TRAINING FOR POLICE AND </p><p>ELECTION COMMISSIONERS, HOWEVER, MAY BE OF LITTLE USE IN </p><p>SYSTEMS THAT STILL DEPEND ON REPRESSION--NOT LEGITIMACY--FOR </p><p>SOCIAL CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. POLITICAL OPENING COMES ABOUT THROUGH INTERNAL CHANGE, </p><p>AND EXTERNAL ACTORS\' ROLES ARE MARGINAL.  HOWEVER, DONORS </p><p>SHOULD LOOK TO ENCOURAGE THREE PROMISING TRENDS: THE </p><p>IMPROVEMENT IN LOCAL MEDIA, SOME NEW ENTREPRENEURISM, AND THE </p><p>SEA CHANGE IN ATTITUDES TOWARDS DEMOCRACY.  USING HISTORY AS </p><p>A GUIDE, THEY SHOULD LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR </p><p>TRANSFORMATION.  THIS CAN HAPPEN WHEN COMPETING SOCIAL FORCES </p><p>ARE EXHAUSTED BUT NEITHER SIDE IS DOMINANT, FOR EXAMPLE WHEN </p><p>A CIVIL WAR ENDS.  ALTERNATIVELY, A SOCIAL PACT CAN BE </p><p>CONSTRUCTED WHEN THERE ARE SEVERE DIVISIONS WITHIN AN </p><p>AUTOCRACY AND CREDIBLE PARTIES ON BOTH SIDES (E.G., </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION) THAT ARE ABLE TO DELIVER. </p><p> </p><p>A VISION FOR THE FUTURE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  IN SPITE OF THE MANY CHALLENGES FACING THE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>OF DEMOCRACY IN NORTH AFRICA, ONE SPEAKER--AN ITALIAN--STATED </p><p>THAT NORTH AFRICA IS MORE PROPERLY PART OF EUROPE THAN </p><p>AFRICA.  WITH THIS IN MIND, CAN WE IMAGINE THAT THIRTY YEARS </p><p>FROM NOW NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRIES WILL BE SO ECONOMICALLY AND </p><p>POLITICALLY DEVELOPED THAT THEY COULD ASPIRE TO BECOME </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION?  IN THE MEANTIME, NORTH AFRICA </p><p>COULD LEARN FROM THE DEMOCRACY LESSONS OF MUSLIM DEMOCRACIES </p><p>LIKE SENEGAL AND EVENTUALLY TIP THE BALANCE ON THE AFRICAN </p><p>CONTINENT TOWARD PEACEFUL POLITICAL PLURALISM. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
