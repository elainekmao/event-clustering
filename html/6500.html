<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000359 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, Human Rights, NLD, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: NLD COMMENTS ON PRISONER RELEASES, INTIMIDATION, </p><p>AND MANDALAY RALLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM RON MCMULLEN FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  On March 18, NLD Central Executive </p><p>Committee members told Embassy officials that the SPDC </p><p>included 3 NLD prisoners in the 45 prisoners released on </p><p>March 16.  However, the NLD also charged that the SPDC </p><p>continues to condone, if not direct, harassment of the NLD </p><p>and Aung San Suu Kyi.  The prisoner releases are the first </p><p>since last November and are probably linked to Special </p><p>Rapporteur Pinheiro\'s visit this week.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Three NLD Prisoners Released </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  On March 16, the SPDC announced the release of 45 </p><p>prisoners described as "elder inmates, females, either </p><p>pregnant or with young children, and those incarcerated for </p><p>disturbing peace and tranquility."  The announcement was </p><p>provided to the local press but, as far as we have </p><p>ascertained, not to the diplomatic community.  The SPDC has </p><p>made similar releases of pregnant women and women with </p><p>children over the past year at the request of Special </p><p>Rapporteur for Human Rights Sergio Pinheiro.  With Pinheiro </p><p>arriving in Rangoon on March 19, it may be that the prisoner </p><p>release was motivated by his visit, although the SPDC has not </p><p>made the connection explicit. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  According to NLD CEC members, there were 3 NLD </p><p>members among those released.  One of the NLD prisoners is </p><p>elderly and another has epilepsy, according to the NLD, so </p><p>the organization was pleased to have them out of prison. </p><p>That said, the CEC members went on to note that these are the </p><p>first NLD prisoners released since last November and that </p><p>there are many other elderly and sick NLD prisoners still in </p><p>prison.  NLD Secretary U Lwin also stated that the identities </p><p>of the 115 prisoners the regime claims to have released in </p><p>November have never been clarified. </p><p> </p><p>Pamphlets Attack ASSK and Authorities Harass NLD Members </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  The NLD CEC members said that the distribution of </p><p>defamatory pamphlets against Aung San Suu Kyi continues at </p><p>many locations throughout the country.  The NLD leaders found </p><p>it implausible that the regime cannot identify those </p><p>distributing the pamphlets when it closely monitors all </p><p>citizens\' activities, especially the publishing and </p><p>distribution of written materials. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The NLD leaders said that, since February, there has </p><p>also been an increase in repression against NLD members at </p><p>locations throughout the country.  They cited the following </p><p>examples: a) authorities discouraged NLD members from working </p><p>at the NLD office in Kawthaung, the southernmost town in </p><p>Burma; b) an NLD Member of Parliament elect in southern Shan </p><p>State was told by local authorities to resign from a position </p><p>he held at a local monastery; and c) authorities in Bago </p><p>questioned and harassed the landlord of the NLD office there. </p><p> NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe argued that while local officials </p><p>took these actions against NLD members, they may have been </p><p>done at the direction of central authorities.  U Aung Shwe </p><p>noted in particular that in some of the locations where </p><p>harassment is occurring relations between the NLD and local </p><p>authorities have traditionally been good. </p><p> </p><p>Ex-members and USDA Hold Anti-NLD Rally in Mandalay </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  The NLD CEC members said recent press reports </p><p>regarding an anti-NLD rally in Mandalay on March 9 were true. </p><p> Two ex-NLD members organized the rally with support from </p><p>Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) members. </p><p>The rally denouncing the NLD was held in Kanaung Hall, which </p><p>is owned by Minister of Industry-1 Aung Thaung; a former a </p><p>Military Intelligence officer and current USDA official. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Comment:  The release of the 45 prisoners, including </p><p>the 3 NLD members, is probably directly linked to Special </p><p>Rapporteur Pinheiro\'s visit this week.  Pinheiro will almost </p><p>certainly urge the regime to release the political prisoners </p><p>as soon as possible, as he has often done in the past. </p><p>Whether these urgings will have any more impact than they </p><p>have in the recent past remains to be seen, particularly in </p><p>view of the NLD\'s allegations of increased regime harassment. </p><p> End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
