<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001078 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, LI, SL, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO ON LIBERIA: TAYLOR IS FINISHED; </p><p>GON WILLING TO PROVIDE ASYLUM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ACCRA 1164 </p><p>     B. STATE 138730 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In two meetings on other issues during the past </p><p>week, Ambassador raised developments in Liberia with </p><p>President Obasanjo.  Obasanjo said Taylor was "finished" as </p><p>President of Liberia.  Obasanjo said he, Ghanaian President </p><p>Kufuor and others at the Accra talks had leaned hard on </p><p>Taylor to accept a three-stage plan precluding Taylor\'s </p><p>participation in a transition government that ultimately </p><p>would lead to internationally supervised elections in </p><p>Liberia.  According to Obasanjo, it was this pressure that </p><p>precipitated Taylor\'s announcement that he would leave </p><p>office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Notwithstanding Taylor\'s indictment by the Special </p><p>Court in Sierra Leone, Obasanjo reiterated the GON\'s </p><p>willingness to offer Taylor asylum if he chooses to leave </p><p>Liberia.  Obasanjo said he was willing to take Taylor in, </p><p>however, "something would have to be done" about the </p><p>indictment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ambassador advised Obasanjo that the GON use its </p><p>influence with the LURD to get the insurgents to bridle </p><p>their ambitions and maintain the cease-fire in order to </p><p>avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Monrovia.  Obasanjo </p><p>replied the U.S. could influence the LURD since he believed </p><p>the U.S. supported and provided military assistance to the </p><p>rebel group.  Ambassador strongly denied USG support for </p><p>the LURD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: Obasanjo still appears willing to give </p><p>Taylor asylum provided the legal complications arising from </p><p>the Special Court\'s indictment can be resolved in a manner </p><p>that does not put Nigeria in violation of international </p><p>law.  Taylor has vowed to fight to the end and on this part </p><p>he might be truer to his word than on most other </p><p>commitments he has made.  The GON is convinced that if </p><p>Taylor remains in Liberia this will result in a blood bath </p><p>for innocent Liberians, and a humanitarian catastrophe for </p><p>the region.  Obasanjo believes that Taylor\'s exile is the </p><p>obvious preferred choice.  Not only is Taylor\'s fate in the </p><p>balance, the fate of thousands of Monrovians may also be at </p><p>stake.  Exile seems like the most practical solution and, </p><p>as far as we know, Obasanjo\'s offer is the only one on the </p><p>table.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
