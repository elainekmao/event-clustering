<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002130 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND PRM, KUWAIT AND NICOSIA FOR DART </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, KPAL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: RUWEISHED RELIEF EFFORTS FLAPPING IN THE WIND </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary and comment:  On April 5, refcoord and </p><p>DART-West monitored operations at the IOM/JRCS TCN transit </p><p>and UNHCR refugee camps in Ruweished.  Rather than serving as </p><p>a brief stopping point on the way home, the IOM/JRCS transit </p><p>camp is struggling to care for an unexpected population of </p><p>Somalis and Sudanese who do not want to return home, </p><p>stateless Palestinians who have no place to go, as well as </p><p>smaller numbers of other nationalities which are logistically </p><p>difficult to repatriate.  Camp management problems, including </p><p>in key water and sanitation sectors, should remain manageable </p><p>as long as the camp population remains small.  The </p><p>still-empty UNHCR refugee camp is well organized and able to </p><p>accommodate an immediate influx of up to 5,000 refugees.  End </p><p>summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>Transit Camp Turned Temporary Refuge </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) IOM\'s expected deluge of tens of thousands of </p><p>Egyptian laborers, who would be bused to Aqaba and then </p><p>ferried to Egypt, has not materialized.  Rather than serving </p><p>as intermediate rest stop for Egyptians, the Jordan Red </p><p>Crescent Society\'s TCN transit camp at Ruweished has </p><p>therefore emerged as a long-term home for roughly 100 </p><p>Sudanese and Somali nationals who are unwilling to return </p><p>home, 40 undocumented Palestinians and a smaller number of </p><p>other nationalities that are proving to be logistically </p><p>difficult to repatriate.  The typical stay at the TCN transit </p><p>camp has dragged out from the anticipated 24-48 hours to one </p><p>or two weeks -- or even longer, for those who do not want to </p><p>return home and are hoping to return to Iraq once conditions </p><p>improve.  The Palestinians, most of whom are long-term </p><p>residents of Iraq, likely will remain at the camp until they </p><p>are able to return to Iraq although King Abdullah on April 7 </p><p>allowed 13 Palestinians with direct family ties to Jordanian </p><p>citizens to enter Amman on a temporary basis (septel). </p><p> </p><p>Jordan Red Crescent Struggling to Cope </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The Jordan Red Crescent Society (JRCS), formally </p><p>tasked by the GOJ to run the transit camp, has struggled with </p><p>basic camp management issues.  Although JRCS lacked key </p><p>resources such as generators or food stocks, it told IOM it </p><p>did not need any financial or technical assistance to run the </p><p>camp.  IOM has therefore provided financial support only for </p><p>80 JRCS volunteers who are serving as medical staff and </p><p>escorts.  (JRCS currently seeks USD 2.5 million in assistance </p><p>from IFRC to cover camp management costs, a sum IFRC termed </p><p>"excessive.")  Even after the crisis began and key management </p><p>gaps emerged, JRCS refused to seek outside help and failed </p><p>even to systematically identify needs.  IOM and IFRC </p><p>officials have tried to offer technical expertise, but report </p><p>that JRCS leadership has resisted their suggestions.  After </p><p>two weeks of tense negotiations, JRCS President Mohamad </p><p>Al-Hadid finally held a coordination meeting with the NGO </p><p>community on March 31, where JRCS, IOM and NGOs together </p><p>identified gaps and possible solutions. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) According to logistics specialists from UNHCR and </p><p>IFRC, the JRCS camp was poorly engineered in just about every </p><p>sense.  JRCS volunteers erected family tents and rubb halls </p><p>improperly, leaving them literally flapping in the sandstorms </p><p>that have buffeted Ruweished for the last few weeks.  JRCS </p><p>failed to provide food or electricity in the early days of </p><p>the crisis, leaving IOM to hire a caterer and purchase a </p><p>generator for the camp.  JRCS also failed to create proper </p><p>warehousing and inventory systems and only established </p><p>separate warehousing for food and non-food items after UNHCR </p><p>implementing partner CARE offered to set up a rubb hall for </p><p>JRCS.  More significantly, latrines and showers were </p><p>constructed in long rows, with inadequate piping, leaving the </p><p>system unable to be properly flushed.  IOM health officials </p><p>report that there also are inadequate hand-washing facilities </p><p>near the latrines and no plans for personal hygiene training </p><p>in the camp.  JRCS medical services -- including a </p><p>well-equipped six-bed clinic -- fortunately appear to be </p><p>adequate. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Water for the camp is provided by the GOJ\'s Ministry </p><p>of Water.  JRCS trucks the water from the nearby municipality </p><p>of Ruweished and then stores it in three 20,000-liter tanks </p><p>throughout the camp.  Although the GOJ\'s Ministry of Health </p><p>has determined that the stored water is potable, camp </p><p>residents complain that the water is brown and full of </p><p>particles and now refuse to drink it.  IFRC experts later </p><p>told refcoord the tanks most likely were not flushed prior to </p><p>installation.  JRCS is now bringing in a separate water </p><p>tanker from Ruweished once a day and distributing drinking </p><p>water directly from the tanker into collapsible jerry cans. </p><p>As one JRCS employee admitted, this distribution system is </p><p>"chaotic." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) IOM and JRCS\' NGO implementing partners also </p><p>complain that JRCS volunteers do not understand fundamental </p><p>principles of camp management.  In the early days of the </p><p>crisis, JRCS officials allowed visitors to roam the camp </p><p>freely, including journalists who interviewed camp residents </p><p>and even broadcast from inside tents.  JRCS later tightened </p><p>security so much that it refused to allow some IOM staff </p><p>access to the camp, impeding IOM\'s efforts to identify TCNs </p><p>for repatriation.  IOM reports that these access issues have </p><p>now been resolved.  Also in the early days of the crisis, </p><p>JRCS volunteers showed up at the camp in overwhelming numbers </p><p>(400 to the camp\'s then-150 residents), lounging in tents, </p><p>chatting on cell phones and jostling the TCNs out of the way </p><p>at mealtimes.  IOM has subsequently convinced JRCS to reduce </p><p>the volunteer presence at the camp. </p><p> </p><p>UNHCR Refugee Camp:  Ready but Empty </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) UNHCR\'s still-empty refugee camp is well organized </p><p>and ready to accommodate an immediate influx of up to 5,000 </p><p>refugees.  After an initial, enthusiastic wave of tent </p><p>construction by the Hashemite Charitable Organization (HCO) </p><p>and subsequent, destructive sandstorms, roughly 400 family </p><p>tents remain standing in the refugee camp.  UNHCR </p><p>implementing partner CARE/Australia, charged with overall </p><p>camp management, has worked closely with GOJ authorities and </p><p>other NGO implementing partners to set up lighting and roads. </p><p> Japan Platform has provided a well-equipped clinic and three </p><p>medical staff remain on 24-hour call.  Oxfam engineered a </p><p>gravity-fed water distribution system that supplies water </p><p>from a nearby GOJ well to tap stands throughout the camp. </p><p>(Water for the camp is treated by the USAID/OFDA-funded </p><p>reverse osmosis unit.)  At the insistence of the HCO, Oxfam </p><p>also installed flush toilets in part of the camp to respond </p><p>to cultural sensitivities.  A well-stocked UNHCR warehouse in </p><p>nearby Ruweished holds non-food items for 10,000 people. </p><p>UNHCR told refcoord April 7 that it intends to keep the camp </p><p>operational through at least May 15. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Muddled though the JRCS\' relief efforts may be, it </p><p>appears that the transit camp management problems -- </p><p>including in the key water and sanitation sectors -- will </p><p>remain manageable as long as the camp population remains </p><p>small.  And should Jordan suddenly experience a large influx </p><p>of TCNs, IOM has the ability to quickly move TCNs to either </p><p>Queen Alia Airport or Aqaba for immediate repatriation.  We </p><p>therefore do not foresee any significant humanitarian </p><p>problems arising in Ruweished. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
