The Fourth Session of Parliament promises </p><p>to be much the same with the GOZ intent on legislation that </p><p>further stifles dissent, free speech, NGOs, and private </p><p>sector initiatives.  President Mugabe\'s economic agenda, </p><p>which he presented during the July 22 Parliamentary opening </p><p>day ceremony, is fantastical, given the prevailing economic </p><p>conditions, and will do nothing to reverse the downward </p><p>economic spiral.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>No Surprises in ZANU-PF Parliamentary Agenda </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Fourth Session of the Fifth Parliament opened </p><p>July 22 with a speech by President Robert Mugabe in which he </p><p>proposed seventeen new bills ZANU-PF would like to pass </p><p>through Parliament.  Several of these new pieces of </p><p>legislation would imperil economic recovery, curtail free </p><p>speech more, and impinge on civil liberties. </p><p> </p><p>Still Trying to Get NGOs </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>3. (U) ZANU-PF has proposed the Non-Governmental </p><p>Organizations Bill, which seeks to ensure the operations of </p><p>Non-Governmental Organizations(NGOs) are consistent with and </p><p>supportive of government policies and programs.  It expands </p><p>the definition of NGOs to include trusts. In September 2002, </p><p>the Government required NGOs to register with the Ministry of </p><p>Social Welfare, in compliance with the Private Voluntary </p><p>Organizations Act, or they would have to cease operations. </p><p>Several ministers asserted that organizations that were not </p><p>required to register because they did not fit the definition </p><p>of an NGO, such as Amani Trust, Zimbabwe Democracy Trust and </p><p>Southern Africa Media Development Fund, were not properly </p><p>registered and engaged in activities intended to unseat the </p><p>government. (See Reftel C). </p><p> </p><p>No More Parliamentary Boycotts </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>4. (U) The Privileges Amendment Bill seeks to amend several </p><p>Acts of Parliament to punish MPs who boycott, interrupt, or </p><p>walk out on a Presidential address to Parliament.  The </p><p>offending MP would be subject to a fine equivalent to six </p><p>months, salary.  The bill would also afford more protection </p><p>to judges against arrest or search in court premises where </p><p>they are judges. </p><p> </p><p>More Land for the Taking </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>5.  (U) The Land Acquisition Amendment Bill seeks to speed up </p><p>the remaining process of acquiring the remaining designated </p><p>land.  Mugabe\'s speech did not make it clear if the </p><p>legislation would sanction his supporters who have abused the </p><p>land redistribution for personal gain. </p><p> </p><p>Indigenization Campaign Continues </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>6. (U) The Indigenization Bill would ensure that companies </p><p>allocate at least twenty percent of shareholding to workers. </p><p>The Mines and Minerals Act also seeks to make it easier for </p><p>small-scale indigenous miners to participate in the industry. </p><p> (Note: Although the bill has yet to be introduced, GOZ </p><p>officials in Mutare have already sent a letter to local </p><p>industrialists instructing them to list how they would comply </p><p>with the 20 percent requirement.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>A New Fund to Help Poor </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) The Posts and Telecommunications Act will set up a </p><p>fund to ensure telecommunication and postal services are </p><p>available to the rural population at reduced prices. </p><p>(Comment: This new fund will most likely not help the rural </p><p>population obtain low-cost phone and postal services unless </p><p>it is designed as an urban (opposition stronghold) subsidy </p><p>for rural areas (ZANU-PF constituency).  It will probably be </p><p>another source of funds for the GOZ to tap for other </p><p>purposes.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>Unfinished Business </p><p>------------------- </p><p>8. (U) In addition to these items, Parliament will resume </p><p>debate on the Citizenship Bill and Electoral Bill, which both </p><p>received adverse reports from the Parliamentary Legal </p><p>Committee (see Reftels A and B). In addition to debate on </p><p>these two bills, Parliament is likely to debate the expulsion </p><p>of Zengeza MDC MP Tafadzwa Musekiwa, who has missed more than </p><p>the constitutional limit of 21 consecutive days of </p><p>Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Economic Plan = Recipe for Destruction </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Mugabe,s economic recovery ambitions are not based </p><p>on reality, or any concept close to this.  The projects and </p><p>policy solutions he proposed in his speech are not based on </p><p>visible economic principles and ignore the role government </p><p>has played in creating the current disastrous economic </p><p>situation.  Mugabe expressed incredulity that basic goods </p><p>such as milk, bread, and vegetable oil reappeared after price </p><p>controls were effectively lifted and prices rose to market </p><p>rates, and then said the GOZ must strengthen price-monitoring </p><p>mechanisms while simultaneously encouraging companies to </p><p>increase capacity utilization. The objective of this </p><p>strengthening exercise is supposedly to make consumer goods </p><p>more affordable but the two objectives are antithetical, as </p><p>the recent history of price controls and production shows. </p><p>In another example of economic ignorance, Mugabe seemed to </p><p>advocate stronger government interference in the production </p><p>process when he proclaimed that the main challenge to </p><p>economic revival was the provision of adequate means, </p><p>production targets, and technical assistance. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Mugabe blamed the shortage of foreign exchange in </p><p>the economy on a weak monetary authority and unclear monetary </p><p>policies that allowed abuse of earnings and speculative </p><p>activities, but he did connect these poor monetary policies </p><p>with the crack-brained ZANU-PF government policies that were </p><p>the root cause.  He also blamed the unethical practices of </p><p>financial institutions, mining houses, and individual </p><p>exporters for the country\'s problems.  To curb these </p><p>practices, Mugabe said the GOZ would introduce an </p><p>Anti-Corruption Commission Bill to stem the outflow of </p><p>foreign exchange through over or under invoicing, discount </p><p>pricing, advance payments to foreign suppliers of raw </p><p>materials, and smuggling of precious metals.  Mugabe also </p><p>proclaimed that interest rates must be brought down to create </p><p>real wealth, even though real interest rates are already </p><p>negative, but never addressed the spiraling inflation rate. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The grandiose economic recovery plans presented in </p><p>Mugabe,s speech are not feasible in the prevailing economic </p><p>environment, especially given the GOZs lack of foreign </p><p>exchange.  Mugabe told Parliament that the GOZ would continue </p><p>construction on ongoing dam projects and begin at least two </p><p>new one.  He also indicated that the GOZ would rehabilitate </p><p>existing smallholder irrigation schemes and construct at </p><p>least two medium irrigation schemes per province (at least 16 </p><p>projects).  He did not explain how the GOZ would pay for </p><p>these initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Mugabe said the GOZ would strive for </p><p>self-sufficiency in the energy sector.  He cited an </p><p>infeasible memorandum of understanding between the Zimbabwe </p><p>Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) and the Mozambique </p><p>government for ZESA to take up equity in Mozambique\'s Hydro </p><p>Caborra Bassa (HCB).  (Note: The Mozambique Government </p><p>reportedly owes Portugal a large sum for HCB costs and wants </p><p>to sell a percentage of the dam. End note.) However, the GOZ </p><p>cannot buy a percentage of the HCB because they have not </p><p>foreign exchange.  Mugabe hinted at a liberalization of the </p><p>fuel sector through a dual price structure even though a dual </p><p>price structure requires huge subsidies and is open to abuse. </p><p> He also proposed an ambitious Gaseous Hydrocarbons Bill that </p><p>would provide for exploration, production, importation, </p><p>transportation, distribution, and utilization of coal-based </p><p>gaseous products and natural gas for economic development, </p><p>even though the GOZ has no way to financial support such </p><p>efforts and it is inconceivable that foreign investors would </p><p>risk a significant up front investment in the prevailing </p><p>business climate. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>No Ratification of Counterterrorism Protocols </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Contrary to what Zimbabwe has led the U.N. Security </p><p>Council\'s Counterterrorism Committee to believe, ratification </p><p>of the UNSCR 1373 is most likely not on Parliament\'s agenda. </p><p>Mugabe did not mention this, and neither ZANU-PF nor MDC MPs </p><p>with whom we spoke were aware of the need for this action. </p><p>(Note: The executive office typically sets Parliament\'s </p><p>agenda and proposes legislation.  End note.) PolOff,s </p><p>attempts to confirm whether the item is on the parliamentary </p><p>agenda with Parliament\'s clerk were futile.  Nonetheless, the </p><p>Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Bill, which seeks to </p><p>establish an anti-money laundering authority to monitor any </p><p>persons suspected of money laundering and provides for the </p><p>confiscation of ill-gotten gains of crimes, may be a move </p><p>toward implementing sections of UNSCR 1373.  It is perhaps </p><p>the one bright spot in an otherwise dim legislative agenda. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Mugabe,s speech gives a preview as to what </p><p>Parliament will do in the next session, particularly since </p><p>most bills come from the executive through the ministries. </p><p>If passed, the proposed legislation would maintain the status </p><p>quo, and Zimbabwe would in all likelihood continue along the </p><p>path of international isolation and condemnation and economic </p><p>decline.  The economic development and recovery plan Mugabe </p><p>proposes can be summarily dismissed because the GOZ does not </p><p>have the wherewithal to fund any of these initiatives, </p><p>refuses to accept basic economic principles, and ignores the </p><p>reality on the ground.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
