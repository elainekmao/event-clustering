<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000726 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/IPA, NEA/ARP, NEA/PD AND NEA/RA </p><p>NSC FOR ABRAMS AND CLARKE </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD AMBASSADOR LITT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 2/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, ECON, EAID, ETRD, KPAO, KDEM, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE OPINION MAKERS TO NEA/RA GRAPPO: MEPI WILL FOUNDER ABSENT </p><p>MEPP PROGRESS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Charge D\'Affaires Thomas Williams for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: NEA/RA Office Director Grappo visited the </p><p>UAE on February 4 to discuss MEPI issues.  He elicited a few program </p><p>ideas, but also a wide range of reactions with local contacts -- from </p><p>the polite indifference of local businesswomen to the obvious enthusias </p><p>of the Ministry of Education Undersecretary. By and large, our contacts </p><p>opined that the timing of the introduction of MEPI is poor, given the </p><p>USG\'s current focus on Iraq.  They also judge our credibility to be </p><p>at low ebb because of perceived inaction on the Middle East Peace </p><p>Process.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Members of the Executive Council of the National </p><p>Businesswomen\'s Committee in Abu Dhabi met with visiting NEA/RA Directo </p><p>Gary Grappo early on the morning of February 4, and initially rebuffed </p><p>MEPI initiatives -- noting that the UAE does not share the economic or </p><p>political problems of Saudi Arabia and others in the region, </p><p>and that Emirati women are afforded equal rights under UAE law.  They </p><p>admitted, however that specific training for businesswomen (writing a </p><p>business plan, managing business accounts, etc.) would be helpful.  The </p><p>plan to discuss challenges to local businesswomen at a National </p><p>Businesswomen\'s Committee-sponsored conference in April. Grappo agreed </p><p>to forward a list of the top businesswomen in America, from which the </p><p>Council could extend invitations to the conference and explore the </p><p>possibility of a U.S-UAE businesswomen-mentoring program, perhaps withi </p><p>the framework of MEPI. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Grappo subsequently met with Dr. Jamal Muheiri, </p><p>Undersecretary at the Ministry of Education and Youth, to discuss </p><p>possibilities for education reform and development in the MEPI </p><p>framework.  Dr. Muheiri, an enthusiastic participant in the </p><p>November U.S.-UAE Strategic Dialogue in Washington, emphasized the </p><p>importance of education as a way of combating extremism. "It is our </p><p>problem too," he said; "this is the problem of our society in this </p><p>century.  We want to provide curricula to the young which will combat </p><p>religious extremism."  Dr. Muheiri requested MEPI assistance </p><p>in four areas in which the UAE has already embarked on reform: </p><p>curriculum development, teacher training, information technology, and </p><p>library systems. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) At a lunch in honor of Grappo, a small group of UAE academics </p><p>and opinion makers made clear that the moribund peace process remains </p><p>among the most important issues and that in the Emirati view, the lack </p><p>of forward movement on the roadmap will significantly hamper the USG\'s </p><p>ability to spread the MEPI message. This view was most eloquently </p><p>conveyed by longtime Embassy contact and Emirates News Agency </p><p>Director Ibrahim Al-Abed -- a Palestinian by birth who is also a key </p><p>advisor to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Minstate Hamdan Bin Zayid </p><p>Al-Nahyan and Information Minister Abdullah Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Capturing the sense of frustration and disappointment of many </p><p>of our contacts, Al-Abed argued that Arabs simply would not accept the </p><p>U.S. message on the need for reform and democratization as credible </p><p>while the Israeli government is bulldozing Palestinian homes and killin </p><p>civilians in the Territories. He scoffed at our decision to delay the </p><p>roadmap until after the Israeli government is formed, noting that Sharo </p><p>is wasting no time in creating additional facts on the ground, and </p><p>derided what he characterized as our "tacit acceptance" of Israel\'s </p><p>decision to block the travel of Palestinian officials to London last </p><p>month.  Al-Abed noted that USG credibility was on the line when we </p><p>called for political reform in the Arab world while at the same time </p><p>seeking a "regime change" in the democratically elected Palestinian </p><p>Authority, all while also cooperating closely with some of the most </p><p>undemocratic regimes in the region.  "We have the right to question," </p><p>he commented acidly, "whether you will ultimately choose your interests </p><p>over your principles." Academic participants at the lunch did not </p><p>disagree with Al-Abed, but rather suggested that since USG credibility </p><p>is at low ebb, we should work MEPI almost entirely through NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Following a brief interview at the Dubai Business Channel, </p><p>Grappo met a number of Dubai businessmen, emirate-level government </p><p>officials, and academics -- who by and large were receptive to MEPI </p><p>principles -- at a dinner hosted by CG Dubai. All agreed that MEPI </p><p>programs probably are not applicable to Dubai, which is more </p><p>likely a model for economic reform and digital readiness for the rest </p><p>of the Middle East, and might be an appropriate location for some of th </p><p>regional training Grappo proposed.  The Dubai crowd was less vocal abou </p><p>its opposition to U.S. policies in the region; the Director of Dubai\'s </p><p>Technology, E-commerce, and Media Free Zone (TECOM  .e. Dubai Interne </p><p>and Media Cities), Ahmed Bin Byat, said to Grappo, "we leave politics t </p><p>Abu Dhabi; politics get in the way of business." (Comment: In Dubai, </p><p>passionate feelings about the issues of Iraq and the Palestinians run </p><p>just as high as they do in Abu Dhabi, but are less likely to spill over </p><p>into business dealings.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) This cable has been coordinated with Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Williams </p><p></p></div>
