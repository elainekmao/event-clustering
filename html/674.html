<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BANJUL 002791 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W </p><p>LONDON FOR MCKINLEY </p><p>PARIS FOR PERLOW </p><p> </p><p>E.0.12356N DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, PINR, GA </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE GAMBIA:  JAMMEH CLAIMS AN OPEN MANDATE </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  LT JAMMEH, THE PRC, AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT MET </p><p>THE PEOPLE OF BANJUL AT A MASS RALLY JULY 13, 1994. </p><p>LT JAMMEH AND OTHER SPEAKERS FOCUSED ON THE NEED FOR </p><p>CHANGE, THE IMPORTANCE OF ROOTING OUT CORRUPTION, AND </p><p>THE NEED FOR NATIONAL UNITY.  LT JAMMEH PROMISED THAT </p><p>THE PRC WOULD REMAIN IN POWER AS LONG AS THE PEOPLE </p><p>OF THE GAMBIA WISHED.  A RETURN TO DEMOCRACY WAS NOT </p><p>DISCUSSED.  LT JAMMEH\'S REMARKS INDICATE A LACK OF </p><p>ENTHUSIASM FOR WESTERN DEMOCRACY AND AN IMMEDIATE </p><p>CONCERN FOR ELIMINATING CORRUPTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>THE PRC MEETS THE BANJULIANS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE ARMED FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING COUNCIL (PRC) </p><p>CALLED A RALLY AT MCCARTHY SQUARE TO MEET THE PEOPLE </p><p>OF THE CITY OF BANJUL SATURDAY AUGUST 13, 1994.  ALL </p><p>FIVE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE PRC ATTENDED, AS WELL AS </p><p>THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (CABINET) AND THE </p><p>NEWLY-APPOINTED MAYOR OF BANJUL, MAJOR ANTOUMAN </p><p>SAHO.  THE RALLY WAS RESCHEDULED FROM THE RAINED-OUT </p><p>EVENT CALLED FOR MONDAY AUGUST 8, 1994.  GRIOTS </p><p>(TRADITIONAL PRAISE-SINGERS) AND FOLKLORIC PERFORMING </p><p>GROUPS WERE SPECIFICALLY INVITED TO THIS EVENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALTHOUGH CALLED FOR 3 PM, MINISTERS WERE NOT </p><p>SEATED UNTIL NEARLY 4:30 PM.  A LIGHT RAIN FELL FOR </p><p>MOST OF THE RALLY, BUT DID NOT APPEAR TO DIMINISH </p><p>ATTENDANCE OR THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE CROWD.  THE RALLY </p><p>ENDED NEAR DUSK, AT APPROXIMATELY 6:45 PM. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>WE\'RE HERE AND WE\'RE IN CHARGE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  LT JAMMEH AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PRC (LTS </p><p>SABALLY, SINGHATEH, HAIDARA, AND TOURAY) ARRIVED ON </p><p>FOOT FROM STATE HOUSE (ABOUT 100 YDS), BUT WERE </p><p>PRECEDED BY TWO MOTORCYCLE ESCORTS AND TWO TRUCKLOADS </p><p>OF BODYGUARDS ARMED WITH MACHINE GUNS AND RPG-7S. </p><p>UPON ENTRY INTO MCCARTHY SQUARE, THE PRC MEMBERS </p><p>JOINED HANDS WITH THEIR ARMS UPRAISED AND CIRCLED THE </p><p>SQUARE, ACCEPTING CHEERS AND HANDSHAKES AS THEY </p><p>PASSED.  THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY NEARLY 40 GUARDS </p><p>ARMED WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.  SECURITY AT THE AUGUST </p><p>13 RALLY WAS MUCH HEAVIER THAN THE CANCELLED AUGUST 8 </p><p>EVENT, WITH TWICE AS MANY SOLDIERS AND MUCH HEAVIER </p><p>WEAPONRY PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  UPON TAKING SEATS, THE DAIS WAS APPROACHED BY </p><p>ALHAJI CONATEH, THE GAMBIA\'S MOST PROMINENT GRIOT AND </p><p>BALAFON PLAYER (AND A FREQUENT VISITOR AT STATE HOUSE </p><p>BEFORE PRESIDENT JAWARA\'S OVERTHROW).  ON BEHALF OF </p><p>ALL THE GRIOTS OF THE GAMBIA, ALHAJI CONATEH THANKED </p><p>THE PRC FOR THEIR NEW GOVERNMENT AND NOTED THAT THIS </p><p>WAS THE FIRST OCCASION AT WHICH ALL THE GAMBIA\'S </p><p>GRIOTS HAD BEEN ASSEMBLED TO GREET THE HEAD OF </p><p>STATE.  ALHAJI CONATEH SPOKE IN ENGLISH, WHICH HE </p><p>FOLLOWED BY REMARKS IN WOLLOF.  A HALF-DOZEN OTHER </p><p>GRIOTS ALSO OFFERED SPEECHES IN WOLLOF ONLY, WHICH IN </p><p>GENERAL ADVISED LT JAMMEH THAT A TRADITIONAL CHIEF </p><p>MUST BE JUST AND IMPARTIAL, AND NOT SWAYED BY TIES OF </p><p>FRIENDSHIP, TRIBE OR FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>WE LIKE OLD-FASHIONED ENTERTAINMENT </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE GRIOT\'S SPEECHES WERE FOLLOWED BY A MIXED </p><p>GROUP OF KORA AND BALAFON PLAYERS AND SINGERS, WHO </p><p>PLAYED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  FOLKLORIC ENSEMBLES THEN </p><p>PERFORMED IN SEQUENCE, BEGINNING WITH A JOLA TROUP </p><p>WHO EXECUTED VERY ACROBATIC DANCES AND SLASHED AT </p><p>THEMSELVES WITH SWORDS AND KNIVES, UNDERSCORING THEIR </p><p>INVULNERABILITY TO SUCH WEAPONS.  AFTER THE JOLA </p><p>TROUP, FIVE OTHER FULA AND WOLLOF DANCERS PER </p><p>FORMED. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>WE\'VE GOT TO WORK HARD . . . </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  AFTER DANCES AND PERFORMANCES WERE FINISHED,  THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (CABINET) AND THE NEW MAYOR OF </p><p>BANJUL WERE INTRODUCED.  MAJ SAHO\'S SPEECH POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT JULY 22 WOULD BE REMEMBERED AS A DAY OF </p><p>PROGRESS OF THE GAMBIA.  HE STATED THAT HIS GOALS </p><p>WERE TO MAKE BANJUL A QUOTE WORLD CLASS CITY UNQUOTE </p><p>IN WHICH THE SECURITY OF BANJULIANS WOULD REMAIN HIS </p><p>PRIMARY CONCERN.   MINISTERS MADE SHORT SPEECHES </p><p>FOCUSED ON QUOTE THE CHANGE (OF GOVERNMENT) UNQUOTE </p><p>AND THE NEED FOR ALL GAMBIANS TO WORK TOGETHER AND TO </p><p>ABANDON THE BAD HABITS OF THE OLD REGIME.  NEITHER </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTER LT HAIDARA NOR FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>DABO SPOKE ON THIS OCCASION. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>STICK TOGETHER . . . </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  LT JAMMEH RECEIVED A THUNDEROUS CHEER WHEN HE </p><p>ROSE TO SPEAK.  HE BEGAN BY ASKING THE CROWD IF THEY </p><p>WANTED JAWARA BACK.  THE CROWD ROARED BACK THAT IT </p><p>DID NOT.  HE ASKED THE QUESTION A SECOND TIME, WITH </p><p>THE SAME ANSWER.  LT JAMMEH THEN POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>JAWARA HAD QUOTE LED BY DIVIDE AND RULE UNQUOTE, AND </p><p>THAT EVERYONE HAD SEEN THE RESULTS OF DIVIDE AND RULE </p><p>IN RWANDA AND SOUTH AFRICA.  DIVIDE AND RULE HAD BEEN </p><p>THE MECHANISM OF COLONIALISM IN AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>10.  LT JAMMEH INSISTED THAT TRIBE HAD HELD SWAY OVER </p><p>BROTHERHOOD (AMONG CO-NATIONALS) UNDER JAWARA, AND </p><p>THAT EVERYONE COULD SEE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS </p><p>POLICY IN RWANDA.  LT JAMMEH PROMISED THAT THE PRC </p><p>WOULD NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN IN THE GAMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>AND REMEMBER WHO WE ARE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE PRC CHAIRMAN THEN MOVED TO THE ISSUE OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  HE POINTED OUT THAT DEMOCRACY HAD ITS </p><p>ROOTS IN GREECE AND ROME, AND HAD BEEN THE POLITICAL </p><p>SYSTEM OF AFRICA\'S COLONIAL MASTERS.  HE REMINDED THE </p><p>CROWD THAT GAMBIANS HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY, AND ASKED IF GAMBIANS WANTED THE TYPE OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY THAT PURCHASED WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION </p><p>WHILE GAMBIANS WERE POOR. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>WE\'LL TAKE CARE OF THINGS . . . </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  LT JAMMEH PROMISED BANJULIANS THAT THE PRC WOULD </p><p>ASSURE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE.  HE ASSURED HIS AUDIENCE </p><p>THAT WHEN THEIR WORK IS DONE THE GNA WOULD GO BACK TO </p><p>BARRACKS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  MOVING TO THE QUESTION OF DETAINEES, ESPECIALLY </p><p>FORMER POLICE AND ARMY OFFICERS (NOTABLY CPTS CHAM </p><p>AND SARR, FORMER SPOKESMAN LT KONTEH, AND FORMER </p><p>INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE PA SALLAH JAGNE, AS WELL </p><p>AS AN ESTIMATED THIRTY OTHERS), LT JAMMEH WARNED THAT </p><p>QUOTE THERE ARE ENEMIES OF THE GAMBIA INSIDE AND </p><p>OUTSIDE UNQUOTE, AND THAT OUR (GAMBIANS\') DUTY WAS TO </p><p>UNITE FOR THE GAMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>AS LONG AS YOU WANT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  LT JAMMEH INTERJECTED THAT WE (THE PRC) ARE HERE </p><p>(IN POWER) TO RECOVER QUOTE EVERY BUTUT (THE SMALLEST </p><p>UNIT OF THE GAMBIAN CURRENCY) PLUNDERED FROM THE </p><p>GAMBIAN PEOPLE UNQUOTE, AND THAT WE (THE PRC) ARE </p><p>HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INTERESTS OF GAMBIANS ARE </p><p>SERVED.  HE THEN ASSURED THE CROWD THAT THE PRC WOULD </p><p>REMAIN IN POWER AS LONG AS THE PEOPLE OF THE GAMBIA </p><p>SO WISHED. </p><p> </p><p>15.  LT JAMMEH CLOSED HIS REMARKS BY PROMISING THAT </p><p>THE PRC WAS FOR AFRICA AND AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT.  HE </p><p>REMINDED HIS LISTENERS THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES IN DETENTION WANTED LOOTING AND </p><p>VIOLENCE, AND THAT THE PRC WOULD NEVER ALLOW SUCH A </p><p>SITUATION IN THE GAMBIA.  QUOTE NOW, NO ONE IS AT </p><p>RISK OF LOSING EVEN A DOG OR A CHICKEN UNQUOTE. </p><p> </p><p>16.  LT JAMMEH\'S FINAL COMMENT WAS THAT THE PRC </p><p>WANTED A GAMBIA FREE OF PPP CORRUPTION.  WITH A FINAL </p><p>QUOTE LONG LIVE GAMBIAN UNITY, LONG LIVE AFRICAN </p><p>UNITY UNQUOTE, PRC MEMBERS LEFT THE DAIS AND WALKED </p><p>BACK TO STATE HOUSE, FOLLOWED BY LARGE NUMBERS OF </p><p>CHEERING YOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  DESPITE ITS RAMBLING, OFF-THE-CUFF DELIVERY, LT </p><p>JAMMEH\'S ADDRESS WAS HIS FIRST MAJOR DEPARTURE FROM </p><p>HIS OFT-DELIVERED EARLIER SET SPEECH ON THE NEED FOR </p><p>THE GNA TO ACT OWING TO OFFICIAL  CORRUPTION AND THE </p><p>PERVERSION OF DEMOCRACY UNDER JAWARA.  THIS RALLY </p><p>WOULD HAVE BEEN THE APPROPRIATE OCCASION TO ANNOUNCE </p><p>THE PRC\'S PROGRAM FOR RETURNING DEMOCRACY TO THE </p><p>GAMBIA, HAD THE PRC WISHED TO DO SO.  THE </p><p>ANTI-WESTERN AND ANTI-DEMOCRATIC TONE OF LT JAMMEH\'S </p><p>REMARKS, HIS FOCUS ON THE PRC\'S MISSION TO FIND AND </p><p>PUNISH CORRUPTION, AND HIS REFUSAL TO BEND ON THE </p><p>ISSUE OF DETENTION OF FORMER ARMY AND POLICE (INCL. </p><p>TACTICAL SUPPORT GROUP) PERSONNEL, ALL INDICATE THAT </p><p>LT JAMMEH\'S AND THE PRC\'S THOUGHTS ARE NOT FOCUSED ON </p><p>AN EARLY RETURN TO BARRACKS OR A QUICK RETURN TO </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IN THE GAMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>18.  THIS RALLY WAS NOTABLY DIRECTED TOWARD </p><p>TRADITIONAL AND LOCAL LEGITIMIZATION OF AUTHORITY, IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO AN EARLIER RALLY HELD A WEEK EARLIER AT </p><p>THE NATIONAL STADIUM IN FAJARA.  PART OF THE RALLY\'S </p><p>MESSAGE SEEMS TO BE THAT TRADITIONAL AFRICAN </p><p>STANDARDS -- RATHER THAN INTERNATIONAL AND WESTERN </p><p>ONES -- WILL BE THE TESTS BY WHICH THE PRC WILL </p><p>MEASURE THEMSELVES AND THEIR GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>19.  LT JAMMEH IS MERCURIAL, AND OFTEN SEEMS TO SPEAK </p><p>WITHOUT REFLECTION.  HIS PAST MISSTATEMENTS APPEAR </p><p>THOUGHTLESS RATHER THAN DELIBERATELY FALSE, AS IN </p><p>REGARD TO EARLIER PRC DISSIMULATION ON THE DETAINEE </p><p>QUESTION.  HE COULD EASILY CHANGE HIS MIND AND CALL </p><p>ELECTIONS QUICKLY.  NONETHELESS, THE POPULIST </p><p>RHETORIC OF THIS RALLY AND HIS IMPLICIT ASSERTION </p><p>THAT THE PRC CAN INTUIT THE WILL OF THE GAMBIAN </p><p>PEOPLE WITHOUT MEDIATION OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS DO </p><p>NOT BODE WELL FOR THE GAMBIA\'S POLITICAL EVOLUTION </p><p>UNDER PRC TUTELAGE. </p><p> </p><p>20.  LT JAMMEH APPEARS TO BE DEVELOPING INTO AN </p><p>EFFECTIVE DEMOGOGUE.  ALTHOUGH STILL SOMEWHAT STIFF </p><p>AND AWKWARD, AT THIS RALLY HE ORCHESTRATED THE </p><p>CROWD\'S RESPONSES VERY WELL.  LT JAMMEH HAS ALREADY </p><p>LEARNED TO MOBILIZE HIS PERSONAL POPULARITY AND </p><p>PUBLIC ADMIRATION FOR HIS AUDACITY AND SENSE OF </p><p>COMMAND INTO AN EASY JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUED </p><p>POWER.  END COMMENT.  REGARDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WINTER </p><p></p></div>
