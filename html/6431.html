<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L USUN NEW YORK 000716 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UNSC, PARM, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ:GERMAN, FRENCH, AND RUSSIAN MARCH 15 JOINT </p><p>DECLARATION </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT, </p><p>REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) ON MARCH 15, GERMAN PERMREP PLEUGER CIRCULATED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING GERMAN, FRENCH, AND RUSSIAN JOINT DECLARATION ON </p><p>IRAQ AS AN ANNEX TO A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF GERMAN, FRENCH, AND RUSSIAN JOINT </p><p>DECLARATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SHARED GOAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS THE </p><p>DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ PURSUANT TO THE DECISIONS OF THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL.  SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1441 </p><p>(2002), ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY, PROVIDES FOR AN UNPRECEDENTED </p><p>INSPECTIONS REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE REAFFIRM THAT NOTHING IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>JUSTIFIES ABANDONING THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS OR RESORTING TO </p><p>FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SUCCESSIVE REPORTS OF MR. HANS BLIX AND MR. MOHAMED </p><p>ELBARADEI HAVE SHOWN THAT THE INSPECTIONS ARE PRODUCING </p><p>RESULTS.  THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ HAS BEGUN, AND THERE IS </p><p>EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN BE COMPLETED RAPIDLY AND </p><p>IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES SET OUT BY THE COUNCIL.  IRAQ, </p><p>FOR ITS PART, MUST COOPERATE ACTIVELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY. </p><p> </p><p>-- FRANCE, GERMANY AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, SUPPORTED BY </p><p>CHINA, HAVE SUBMITTED PROPOSALS FOR ACHIEVING THAT OBJECTIVE </p><p>BY DEFINING KEY DISARMAMENT TASKS AND ESTABLISHING A RIGOROUS </p><p>TIMETABLE. </p><p> </p><p>-- SUGGESTIONS IN THE SAME SPIRIT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BY </p><p>OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.  THE UNITY OF THE COUNCIL CAN </p><p>BE PRESERVED ON THE BASIS OF THESE EFFORTS, IN ACCORDANCE </p><p>WITH THE PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED BY RESOLUTION 1441 (2002). </p><p>ALL MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL BEAR A PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR ENSURING THAT IT IS NOT DIVIDED AT THIS CRUCIAL TIME. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PROGRAMME OF WORK OF THE UNITED NATIONS MONITORING, </p><p>VERIFICATION AND INSPECTION COMMISSION (UNMOVIC) IS TO BE </p><p>SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL ON TUESDAY.  WE PROPOSE THAT THE </p><p>COUNCIL SHOULD THEN MEET AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL TO APPROVE </p><p>KEY DISARMAMENT TASKS AND ESTABLISH AN IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>TIMETABLE WHICH IS BOTH DEMANDING AND REALISTIC. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE USE OF FORCE CAN BE ONLY A LAST RESORT.  A PEACEFUL </p><p>APPROACH IS PREFERRED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND SUPPORTED </p><p>BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY; WE </p><p>SOLEMNLY APPEAL TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL TO MAKE EVERY </p><p>EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT SUCH AN APPROVAL PREVAILS. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT </p><p> </p><p>NEGROPONTE </p><p></p></div>
