<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002062 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AD/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Who will pre-empt the war on Iraq?" </p><p>      the independent, pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" </p><p>      dedicated its September 8 editorial to urging the United </p><p>      Nations Security Council to stop the United States and </p><p>      Britain from attacking Iraq.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The first salvos of the unfolding war against Iraq </p><p>      have already been fired.  The U.S. and its key ally, the </p><p>      UK, are meeting this weekend, in the context of a `Council </p><p>      of War\' (to use their own words), almost as a confirmation </p><p>      that war can no longer be stopped.  And with the </p><p>      anniversary of the September 11 due this week, war fever </p><p>      has almost engulfed the U.S.  We have no doubt that other </p><p>      members of the </p><p>      UN Security Council will deny Bush and Blair the nod </p><p>      they are seeking as a formality for war plans </p><p>      already concluded.  It will be yet another test for </p><p>      the world body, a commendable outcome, of at least </p><p>      Russia, China and France can stand up and be </p><p>      counted, even if, as appears to be the case, the </p><p>      U.S. and the UK should persist with their war plans. </p><p>      [NB: This is an accurate transcription.] </p><p> </p><p>      "If Bush and Blair should go it alone, the emptiness </p><p>      of their cause will become even more obvious and </p><p>      their penchant for bullying thereby exposed.  But it </p><p>      might not be too late to stop this senseless war, </p><p>      provided that all sections of our Earth speak out </p><p>      and demand that Kofi Annan calls an urgent meeting </p><p>      of the UN Security Council.  The Arab World has </p><p>      already stated its strong opposition to any attack </p><p>      on Iraq and, in so doing, has exposed the hawk that </p><p>      is Israel that alone in the Middle East is in favor </p><p>      of war.  Africa and the Third World need to add </p><p>      their voice.  It is not too late to clinch a </p><p>      diplomatic solution over Iraq and place the matter </p><p>      entirely within the ambit of the United Nations." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
