<p>S E C R E T  STATE 080724 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:    IR, PINT, PEPR </p><p>SUBJECT:    THE IRANIAN SUCCESSION </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S  ENTIRE TEXT). </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS, PREPARED BY INR/NESA IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 1985, MAY BE OF BACKGROUND INTEREST TO ADDRESSEE </p><p>POSTS. </p><p> </p><p>T H E  I R A N I A N  S U C C E S S I O N  A N D  I T S </p><p>C O N S E Q U E N C E S </p><p> </p><p>3.  IT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT PRECISELY HOW </p><p>EVENTS WILL UNFOLD IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS FOLLOWING </p><p>KHOMEINI\'S DEATH.  BUT THE CLERICAL GROUP NOW IN POWER IS </p><p>SO ENTRENCHED THAT IT COULD DOMINATE FOR SOME YEARS.  AT </p><p>BEST, THERE COULD BE A GRADUAL SOFTENING OF THE REGIME\'S </p><p>VIEW OF THE US.  BUT INCREASING INSTABILITY AND SOVIET </p><p>PRESSURE ARE MORE LIKELY TO KEEP THE US IN THE POSITION </p><p>OF THE MAJOR ENEMY OF IRAN.  OVER THE LONGER RUN, WE </p><p>THINK A SINGLE STRONG LEADER WILL EMERGE.  IF HE COMES </p><p>FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD MILITIA, AS NOW APPEARS THE </p><p>BEST BET, HE WILL SHARE MUCH OF THE OUTLOOK OF THE </p><p>PRESENT LEADERSHIP.  THAT WOULD MAKE HIM DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>THE US TO WORK WITH, THOUGH HE MIGHT NOT HAVE KHOMEINI\'S </p><p>DEDICATION TO PURSUING THE WAR WITH IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PROBABLE SUCCESSION SCENARIO:  MOST LIKELY IS A </p><p>RELATIVELY SMOOTH INITIAL TRANSITION TO THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>POST-KHOMEINI ERA.  THE CLERICS ARE PREPARED TO MOVE </p><p>QUICKLY TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY AND CONTROL.  A COMMITTEE </p><p>OF EXPERTS TO MAKE THE CHOICE OF SUCCESSOR HAS BEEN </p><p>ELECTED AND MEETS SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR.  IT SEEMS </p><p>INCLINED TO SETTLE ON AYATOLLAH MONTAZERI, A CHOICE WE </p><p>BELIEVE WILL BE ENDORSED IN KHOMEINI\'S SEALED WILL. </p><p>MONTAZERI WOULD NOT BY ANY MEANS HAVE UNQUESTIONED </p><p>COMMAND.  INDEED, THE INITIAL IRANIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE </p><p>A COLLEGIAL AFFAIR BECAUSE NO SINGLE IRANIAN LEADER WILL </p><p>BE ABLE TO REPLACE KHOMEINI. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE MAIN IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE TO THIS SUCCESSION </p><p>SCENARIO WOULD COME FROM THE JOCKEYING FOR POWER ALREADY </p><p>APPARENT BETWEEN FACTIONS INSIDE THE PRESENT LEADERSHIP </p><p>CADRE.  SHOULD  SUCH RIVALS AS PRESIDENT ALI KHAMENEI AND </p><p>MAJLES LEADER ALI AKBAR RAFSANJANI CLASH, THAT WOULD </p><p>INEVITABLY LEAD TO SERIOUS DISORDER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  A MAJOR DIFFICULTY WILL BE PRESENTED BY THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY GUARD, THE PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION WHICH </p><p>HAS FUNCTIONED AS THE REGIME\'S PRAETORIAN GUARD.  EVEN </p><p>KHOMEINI HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIT THE GUARD SMOOTHLY INTO </p><p>THE CURRENT SOCIAL OR GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE.  AND SHOULD </p><p>THE GUARD THROW ITS CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT BEHIND ONE </p><p>FIGURE, HIS PRIMACY WOULD BE GIVEN A STRONG BOOST. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE LONGER TERM:  WHILE NON-CLERICAL ELEMENTS WILL </p><p>HAVE A HARD TIME COMPETING IN THIS ARENA FOR A LONG TIME </p><p>TO COME, THE CLERICS HAVE NOT INSTITUTIONALIZED CONTROL </p><p>IN ANY DURABLE WAY.  THE INSTABILITY PROVOKED BY </p><p>INFIGHTING AMONG VARIOUS CLERICAL FACTIONS IS LIKELY TO </p><p>BE INCREASED BY ECONOMIC TROUBLES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL </p><p>WEAKNESSES (E.G., CONTINUED MIGRATION TO THE CITIES). </p><p> </p><p>8.  WE THUS REGARD A POSTKHOMEINI CLERICAL REGIME AS </p><p>ESSENTIALLY TRANSITIONAL.  THE CHANCES SEEM GOOD THAT IT </p><p>WILL GIVE WAY SOONER OR LATER TO A SINGLE STRONG LEADER. </p><p>ASSUMING THAT THERE WILL BE NO MAJOR OUTSIDE INTERVENTION </p><p>TO DEFLECT THIS NATURAL COURSE OF EVENTS, THE TRANSITION </p><p>MANEUVERING COULD BE LENGTHY.  THAT WOULD OPEN </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES TO A BROADER RANGE OF PLAYERS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN THE END, HOWEVER, WE THINK THAT THE CHANCES FAVOR </p><p>THE EMERGENCE OF A "MAN ON HORSEBACK."  WE WOULD EXPECT </p><p>HIM TO ACT IN THE NAME OF ISLAM AND CLAIM TO DEFEND THE </p><p>FRUITS OF THE REVOLUTION.  AT PRESENT, THE MOST LIKELY </p><p>INSTITUTION TO PRODUCE SUCH A FIGURE IS THE REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>GUARD.  IF THE TRANSITION IS LONG ENOUGH, HOWEVER, </p><p>SOMEONE COULD EMERGE FROM THE REGULAR MILITARY, DESPITE </p><p>EFFORTS TO PREVENT ANY POPULAR HERO FROM USING THE WAR </p><p>WITH IRAQ TO CATAPULT INTO PROMINENCE.  AS YET WE ARE </p><p>UNABLE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  POSSIBLE SOVIET ROLE:  ALTHOUGH THE SOVIETS HAVE </p><p>ASSETS AND CAN BRING SOME PRESSURE TO BEAR ON THE </p><p>SUCCESSION SITUATION, WE DO NOT BELIEV THAT THEY WILL BE </p><p>ABLE TO EXERT A DETERMINING INFLUENCE OVER THE COURSE OF </p><p>EVENTS.  THE TUDEH PARTY HAS BEEN CRIPPLED THROUGH </p><p>ARRESTS AND EXECUTIONS, THOUGH ITS PRINCIPAL LEADERS ARE </p><p>STILL ALIVE IN IRANIAN JAILS.  WHILE THE SOVIETS MAY BE </p><p>ENCOURAGING THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW PARTY ORGANIZATION, </p><p>THE PARTY HAS NEVER ENJOYED BROAD APPEAL.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>SOVIET ASSETS AMONG THE MINORITIES WOULD FIND IT </p><p>DIFFICULT TO INFLUENCE THE NATIONAL SCENE IN IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE USSR CAN USE ITS CONTROL OVER LAND ROUTES TO </p><p>IRAN, ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF WHICH PASS THROUGH SOVIET </p><p>TERRITORY, TO EXERT PRESSURE.  AND IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO </p><p>MANIPULATE ARMS SALES, IF BY THAT TIME THE SOVIETS HAD </p><p>MANAGED TO ESTABLISH A MAJOR SUPPLY RELATIONSHIP.  BUT </p><p>PRESSING IN THIS WAY WOULD BE RISKY AND THE SOVIETS </p><p>PROBABLY WOULD NOT MAKE AN ALL-OUT PUSH IN THIS DIRECTION. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WE DO NOT EXPECT A SOVIET MILITARY INVASION OF </p><p>IRAN.  A LIMITED STRIKE INTO THE BORDER PROVINCE OF </p><p>AZERBAIJAN WOULD BE POSSIBLE IF IRAN WERE IN CHAOS AND </p><p>APPEARED TO BE FRAGMENTING.  HOWEVER, THE SOVIETS WOULD </p><p>PROBABLY ACT ONLY IF A US MILITARY RESPONSE APPEARED </p><p>UNLIKELY.  ALTERNATIVELY, THEY MIGHT ATTEMPT TO OCCUPY </p><p>AZERBAIJAN IF THEY BELIEVED THE US WERE PREPARING TO </p><p>SEIZE PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN IRAN.  THE USSR MIGHT LAUNCH A </p><p>PREEMPTIVE INVASION IF IT SUSPECTED US PREPARATIONS </p><p>EITHER TO INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF PRO-AMERICAN ELEMENTS OR </p><p>TO SECURE IRANIAN OIL FIELDS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  ALL THESE CONTINGENCIES APPEAR EXTREMELY DISTANT. </p><p>THE SOVIETS WOULD HAVE TO ANTICIPATE THAT THEY WOULD FACE </p><p>A US MILITARY RESPONSE AS WELL AS DIFFICULT LOGISTICAL </p><p>AND TERRAIN PROBLEMS.  MOREOVER, THE SOVIET LEADERS </p><p>PROBABLY PROJECT THAT IRANIAN RESISTANCE WOULD BE ON THE </p><p>ORDER OF THEIR AFGHAN EXPERIENCE AND THAT MAJOR RESOURCES </p><p>WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PACIFY A COUNTRY AS LARGE AND </p><p>POPULOUS AS IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>14.  OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE US?  THE US WILL PROBABLY HAVE </p><p>LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO INFLUENCE THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN </p><p>THE IMMEDIATE POST-KHOMEINI PERIOD.  LEADING POLITICAL </p><p>FIGURES APPARENTLY STILL BELIEVE THAT THE US HAS NOT </p><p>ACCEPTED THE REVOLUTION AND ITS RESULTS.  AS LONG AS WE </p><p>APPEAR TO BE TILTING TOWARD IRAQ AND ARE ISRAEL\'S CLOSEST </p><p>SUPPORTER, THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO CHANGE THAT OPINION.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE REGIME SEES ITSELF LOCKED IN A STRUGGLE </p><p>WITH THE US FOR CONTROL OF THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC WORLD.  THUS THEY IDENTIFY THE US AS THE PRIMARY </p><p>ENEMY TO BE DEFEATED IN THE EFFORT TO LIBERATE THE </p><p>ISLAMIC WORLD FROM THE GRIP OF WESTERN CULTURAL VALUES. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THESE PERCEPTIONS PUT THE US IN A PARTICULARLY </p><p>DIFFICULT POSITION AS IRAN MOVES INTO THE POST-KHOMEINI </p><p>ERA.  ANY SUCCESSOR REGIME SEEMS DESTINED TO MAINTAIN </p><p>ITSELF IN POWER IN THE NAME OF ISLAM AND THE REVOLUTION. </p><p>THUS IT WILL HAVE A BUILT-IN ANTI-AMERICAN BIAS.  IRAN </p><p>MIGHT GROW LESS HOSTILE TO THE US OVER TIME IF WE WERE </p><p>NOT SEEN AS WORKING AGAINST THE REGIME IN TEHRAN, E.G., </p><p>BY ENCOURAGING THE CUT-OFF OF ARMS TO IRAN.  BUT THIS </p><p>WOULD BE A SLOW PROCESS AT BEST, AND IT COULD BE SET BACK </p><p>BY EVENTS OVER WHICH WE WOULD HAVE NO CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR:  KHOMEINI\'S DEATH WOULD REMOVE </p><p>ONE OF THE STAUNCHEST ADVOCATES IN IRAN OF WAR TO THE </p><p>BITTER END.  YET THE CLERICS ARE BY AND LARGE UNITED ON </p><p>THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR, UNLESS IRAN CAN EMERGE WITH </p><p>HONOR.  THAT WOULD INCLINE MOST OF THEM TO INSIST ON THE </p><p>OUSTER OF IRAQI PRESIDENT SADAM HUSSEIN AS A PRECONDITION </p><p>FOR ENDING HOSTILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>17.  NONETHELESS, THE SUCCESSOR REGIME, ONCE IT FELT MORE </p><p>OR LESS SOLIDLY IN CONTROL AT HOME, MIGHT BECOME MORE </p><p>FLEXIBLE IN ITS ATTITUDES TOWARD THE WAR.  TACTICS FOR </p><p>FIGHTING AND TOWARD NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BE AMONG SEVERAL </p><p>ISSUES THAT WILL DIVIDE THE REGIME LOYALISTS.  OPPONENTS </p><p>OF THE WAR ARE LIKELY TO BLAME ITS ADVOCATES FOR </p><p>WEAKENING THE REGIME\'S BASE OF SUPPORT, FOR THE LARGE </p><p>CASUALTIES, AND FOR DIVERSION OF ECONOMIC RESOURCES.  THE </p><p>WAR\'S PROPONENTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL CHARGE THAT ITS </p><p>OPPONENTS LACK REVOLUTIONARY ISLAMIC FERVOR AND ARE NOT </p><p>ADHERING TO KHOMEINI\'S WISHES. </p><p> </p><p>18.  ON BALANCE, THEREFORE, WE BELIVE THAT THE CHANCES OF </p><p>ENDING THE WAR WILL RISE SOMEWHAT AFTER KHOMEINI </p><p>DEPARTS.  BUT IRAN\'S WILLINGNESS TO MAKE PEACE IS BY NO </p><p>MEANS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. </p><p> </p><p>SHULTZ </p><p></p></div>
