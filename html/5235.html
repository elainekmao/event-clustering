<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000244 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, PHUM, ECON, ETRD, KN, AF, PK, PARM, PHUM, ECON, ETRD, KN, AF, PK, IT, ITPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY:  DPRK; AFGHAN TRADE AND INVESTMENT; </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S FUTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 1211 </p><p>     B. ROME 26 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM EMIL SKODON, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  MFA OFFICIALS ASSURED CHARGE THAT THE GOI </p><p>WOULD PURSUE NO INITIATIVE ON THE DPRK, INCLUDING THE IDEA OF </p><p>"HUMANITARIAN" OIL SHIPMENTS, WITHOUT OUR CONCURRENCE AND </p><p>COLLABORATION.  CHARGE ALSO SOUGHT REACTION TO REF A REQUEST </p><p>FOR INFORMATION ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN TRADE TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, DISCUSSED PAKISTAN\'S FUTURE, AND CONSIDERED </p><p>REFORM OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION (SEPTEL).  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>DPRK AND HUMANITARIAN OIL SHIPMENTS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (C)  CHARGE MET MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR ASIA GUIDO </p><p>MARTINI (FORMERLY ITALY\'S AMBASSADOR TO SEOUL) AND UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY FOR ASIA AND HUMAN RIGHTS MARGHERITA BONIVER IN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SEPARATE COURTESY CALLS JANUARY 13.  THE GOI\'S RECENT </p><p>PROPOSAL TO OFFER "HUMANITARIAN" OIL SHIPMENTS TO NORTH KOREA </p><p>(REF B) WAS A PRIMARY TOPIC OF CONVERSATION IN BOTH MEETINGS, </p><p>AND BOTH MARTINI AND BONIVER ASSURED CHARGE THAT ITALY WOULD </p><p>DO NOTHING WITHOUT USG CONCURRENCE AND COLLABORATION.  IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00244  01 OF 02  211403Z </p><p>APPEARED THE IDEA HAD BEEN MARTINI\'S WHILE BONIVER WAS AWAY </p><p>FROM ITALY ON HOLIDAY LEAVE; SHE QUASHED THE INITIATIVE UPON </p><p>HER RETURN, TELLING CHARGE THE IDEA OF AN INDIVIDUAL ITALIAN </p><p>ROLE IN NORTH KOREA WAS "TOTALLY WRONG."  THE GOI SHOULD NOT </p><p>MAKE SUCH A PROPOSAL WITHOUT COORDINATING IT WITH THE U.S. IN </p><p>ADVANCE; "IT WOULD BE ALL BUT FATAL TO SEND MIXED SIGNALS." </p><p>THE ITALIANS, HOWEVER, REMAIN INTERESTED IN COOPERATING WITH </p><p>THE USG ON KOREA AND WOULD LIKE TO BE USEFUL, IF THE U.S. </p><p>THOUGHT THE OIL SHIPMENTS OR ANY OTHER INITIATIVE COULD HELP </p><p>MOVE THE SITUATION WITH THE DPRK FORWARD.  NOTING THAT </p><p>WASHINGTON HAD NOT OVERALL PROVIDED GUIDANCE DIRECTLY ON THE </p><p>OIL PROPOSAL, CHARGE ADVISED HIS INTERLOCUTORS THAT NOW WAS </p><p>NOT THE TIME FOR ANY INITIATIVE WHICH COULD BE PERCEIVED AS </p><p>REWARDING PYONGYANG\'S BAD BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  MARTINI REVEALED THAT THE GOI HAD DISCUSSED THE </p><p>PROPOSAL WITH ITS EU PARTNERS (COMMENT:  PRESUMABLY BEFORE </p><p>BONIVER\'S RETURN), AND REPORTED THAT EUROPE WAS "AMAZINGLY </p><p>DIVIDED" ON THE PROPOSAL.  THE UK AND FRANCE ARE STRONGLY </p><p>OPPOSED; MARTINI SAID FRENCH PRESIDENT CHIRAC "PERSONALLY </p><p>REJECTS" ANY APPROACH TO NORTH KOREA.  THE DANES AND DUTCH </p><p>ARE ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS OPPOSED.  HE DESCRIBED THE FRG AND </p><p>SPAIN AS BEING "AGAINST BUT OPEN," AND CHARACTERIZED ITALY, </p><p>SWEDEN, FINLAND AND THE EU COMMISSION AS BEING "OPEN TO </p><p>FINDING A SOLUTION OR HUMANITARIAN GESTURE TOWARD THE NORTH." </p><p> HE UNDERSCORED THAT IN ANY EVENT, THE GOI WANTED TO MOVE IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH THE U.S.  THAT WOULD ALSO MAKE IT EASIER TO </p><p>FIND CONSENSUS WITHIN THE EU.  MARTINI EXPLAINED THAT PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI AND FOREIGN MINISTER FRATTINI WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO SEE ITALY TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO HELP THE U.S. REACH A </p><p>SOLUTION IN KOREA.  HE WAS CONVINCED, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00244  01 OF 02  211403Z </p><p>SOLUTION LAY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE DPRK.  "IF YOU THINK WE </p><p>CAN BE USEFUL, GIVE US A SIGN." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  MARTINI SAID REPEATEDLY THAT FINDING A POLITICAL </p><p>SOLUTION WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN DEALING WITH AN </p><p>"UNPREDICTABLE OUTCAST" LIKE THE DPRK.  EVEN AFTER FOUR YEARS </p><p>IN SEOUL, HE FINDS THE NORTH KOREANS COMPLETELY </p><p>UNPREDICTABLE. THE NORTH KOREANS, HE FUMED, USE BEHAVIOR </p><p>WHICH IS COMPLETELY AT ODDS WITH THEIR AIMS, AND IT SEEMS </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVINCE THEM TO CHANGE.  NONETHELESS, HE </p><p>REMAINED CONVINCED PYONGYANG "WANTS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP" </p><p>WITH THE U.S., DISCUSSIONS, AND "REASSURANCE."  HE THOUGHT IT </p><p>LIKELY THE DPRK MIGHT EVENTUALLY REQUEST A SEPARATE PEACE </p><p>TREATY WITH THE U.S. AT THE EXPENSE OF SOUTH KOREA.  HE ALSO </p><p>BELIEVED THE DPRK WANTED DIALOGUE WITH THE SOUTH, BUT THOUGHT </p><p>INTERACTION WITH THE U.S. WAS MORE IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  CHARGE ASKED MARTINI WHY, IF WHAT IT WANTED WAS </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE U.S., THE DPRK HAD INTERRUPTED THE PROCESS </p><p>THAT PROVIDED FOR DIALOGUE.  "I SAID THEY WERE </p><p>UNPREDICTABLE," MARTINI REPLIED.  HE OPINED, HOWEVER, THAT IF </p><p>THE U.S. WERE TO ESTABLISH POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE NORTH AND "SETTLE PROBLEMS WITH THEM ONCE AND FOR </p><p>ALL," IT MIGHT HELP -- ALTHOUGH THEY WILL ALWAYS BE </p><p>UNPREDICTABLE, HE ADDED.  THE IDEA OF A NON-AGGRESSION PACT </p><p>IS LUDICROUS TO THE WEST, BUT WITH NORTH KOREA, IT MIGHT </p><p>HELP.  THEN, MARTINI SUGGESTED, PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE </p><p>ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY, HELP FOR THE STARVING POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6598 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00244  02 OF 02  211403Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   C-00     USNW-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     CAC-00   VCE-00   M-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NEA-00   NRRC-00  NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03   OES-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SA-00    R-00     SSD-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /015W </p><p>                  ------------------28F3A9  211404Z /38 </p><p>P 211333Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7770 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY ISLAMABAD </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY SEOUL </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00244  02 OF 02  211403Z </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000244 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, PHUM, ECON, ETRD, KN, AF, PK, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY:  DPRK; AFGHAN TRADE AND INVESTMENT; </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S FUTURE </p><p> </p><p>MARTINI SHARED HIS CONVICTION THAT THE U.S. SHOULD RESOLVE </p><p>THE SITUATION WITH KOREA, AND THE SOLUTION SHOULD BE </p><p>IMMEDIATELY CONFIRMED AT AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM.  "REMEMBER, </p><p>CHINA AND RUSSIA ARE WITH YOU ON ALMOST ALL POINTS."  HE </p><p>REPEATED THAT THE PROSPECT OF A DIRECT SOLUTION AND STABILITY </p><p>MIGHT WIN OVER THE DPRK. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  CHARGE NOTED U.S. FRUSTRATION THAT, WHILE WE WERE </p><p>WILLING TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE IN THE FUTURE, TO </p><p>TALK, TO HAVE A MORE NORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DPRK, NORTH </p><p>KOREA SEEMED TO BELIEVE IT WOULD ONLY BE REWARDED IF IT </p><p>BEHAVED BADLY.  THE SECRETARY WAS CONVINCED IT WAS VITAL TO </p><p>REVERSE THIS "NEGATIVE PROGRESSION" AND PROVE TO THE NORTH </p><p>THAT SUCH BEHAVIOR WOULD BRING COSTS, NOT REWARDS.  CHARGE </p><p>ADDED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BE REALISTIC IN OUR </p><p>EXPECTATIONS, RECOGNIZING THAT WE CANNOT SATISFY ALL OF NORTH </p><p>KOREA\'S.  THE USG, INCLUDING THE SECRETARY, HAS MADE CLEAR </p><p>THAT IF THE DPRK REVERSES SOME OF ITS ACTIONS, THE U.S. IS </p><p>OPEN TO DIALOGUE AND TO A RESOLUTION.  THE U.S. CANNOT REWARD </p><p>UNREASONABLE DEMANDS; IT IS UP TO NORTH KOREA TO GET BACK </p><p>INTO THE GAME.  "IN SOME WAYS," MARTINI REPLIED, "SOLVING THE </p><p>SITUATION IN IRAQ IS EASIER THAN SOLVING THE SITUATION IN </p><p>NORTH KOREA." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  BONIVER ASKED CHARGE ABOUT THE DPRK VISIT TO FORMER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00244  02 OF 02  211403Z </p><p>GOVERNOR/ENERGY SECRETARY BILL RICHARDSON.  CHARGE STRESSED </p><p>THAT THIS WAS A PERSONAL INVITATION AND NOT A BACK CHANNEL </p><p>FOR THE USG, ALTHOUGH RICHARDSON WOULD LIKELY SHARE ANY </p><p>INFORMATION OR IMPRESSIONS HE GAINED.  THE U.S. CONTINUED TO </p><p>SEEK GREATER CLARITY FOR WHY THE DPRK HAD TAKEN THE ACTION IT </p><p>HAD.  BONIVER NOTED SHE HAD RECENTLY MET WITH SEVERAL SOUTH </p><p>KOREAN PARLIAMENTARIANS AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THEIR </p><p>PRIMARY CONCERN WAS THAT THE NORTH\'S ACTION MIGHT PROMPT </p><p>JAPAN TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  CHARGE SAID CHINA HAD </p><p>SIMILAR CONCERNS.  THEY AGREED A MORE SERIOUS CONCERN FOR </p><p>CHINA WAS THE PROSPECT OF MILLIONS OF REFUGEES IF WAR BROKE </p><p>OUT ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>PROMOTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>8.  (C)  WITH U/S BONIVER, CHARGE RAISED REF A REQUEST FOR </p><p>INFORMATION ON ASSISTANCE CURRENTLY PROVIDED, OR IDEAS ON </p><p>HOW, TO PROMOTE TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN AFGHANISTAN.  NEITHER </p><p>BONIVER NOR HER CHIEF OF STAFF, ALESSANDOR DI FRANCO (ALSO IN </p><p>THE MEETING), SUGGESTED ANY ACTIVE ITALIAN PROGRAMS IN THESE </p><p>AREAS.  BONIVER SUGGESTED THAT INVESTMENT SHOULD BE FOCUSED </p><p>ON LABOR-INTENSIVE IDEAS AND PROGRAMS, EMPHASIZING THE NEED </p><p>FOR MORE EMPLOYMENT IN AFGHANISTAN. SHE AGREED WITH CHARGE ON </p><p>THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN BEGAN -- </p><p>SOON -- TO SHOW RESULTS TO THE AFGHAN PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO </p><p>SOLIDIFY SUPPORT FOR THE CENTRAL AFGHAN GOVERNMENT.  BONIVER </p><p>EXPRESSED SOME FRUSTRATION THAT SO MUCH GOI AID IS ALREADY </p><p>COMMITTED THROUGH MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS, AND SAID UN AND </p><p>OTHER ORGANIZATIONS MUST BE PRESSED TO START SHOWING RESULTS, </p><p>TOO. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00244  02 OF 02  211403Z </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>PAKISTAN BIGGEST WORRY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>9.  (C)  CHARGE ASKED BONIVER WHAT WORRIED HER MOST IN HER </p><p>LARGE PORTFOLIO.  (BONIVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EAST, </p><p>SOUTHEAST, CENTRAL AND SOUTH ASIA, AS WELL AS IRAN AND GLOBAL </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.)  "PAKISTAN," SHE REPLIED WITHOUT </p><p>HESITATION.  GENERAL MUSHARRAF HAS DONE A "FANTASTIC JOB FOR </p><p>A DICTATOR," BONIVER CONTINUED, ADDING THAT SHE HAD A CERTAIN </p><p>ADMIRATION FOR HIM.  SHE EVALUATED HIS CHANCE OF POLITICAL </p><p>SURVIVAL AS GOOD, "UNLESS HE IS ASSASSINATED."  BUT HOW LONG, </p><p>SHE WONDERED, WOULD THE RISE OF FUNDAMENTALISM BE CONTROLLED? </p><p> SHE ALSO EXPRESSED LITTLE HOPE FOR PAKISTAN\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>FUTURE; THE GOP ECONOMY, SHE ASSERTED, IS A WRECK. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00244 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
