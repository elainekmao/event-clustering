MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Foreign Minister Narendra Bikram Shah returns on </p><p>January 28 from an unofficial visit to Bhutan to discuss the </p><p>refugee issue with his counterpart.  Shah said he believes </p><p>the visit presents a window of opportunity to secure a </p><p>bilateral resolution to the problem.  The EU representative </p><p>in Kathmandu expressed deep skepticism that Bhutan is serious </p><p>about resolving the problem and noted that many European </p><p>donors are reluctant to use their leverage to pressure the </p><p>kingdom on refugee repatriation.  He welcomed the idea, </p><p>however, of the EU and USG working out a joint position to </p><p>encourage progress before the Feb. 17 donors\' meeting in </p><p>Geneva.  The Indian Embassy has expressed dismay at U.S. </p><p>activism on the refugee matter.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>DISAGREEMENT OVER CITIZENSHIP </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On January 22 the Ambassador and DCM conveyed Ref </p><p>C talking points to Foreign Minister Narendra Bikram Shah and </p><p>to Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya respectively.  Shah </p><p>left for an "unofficial" visit to Bhutan to discuss the </p><p>refugee issue with his counterpart oon January 23.  (Note: </p><p>The low-key visit, which was originally supposed to be </p><p>confidential, was touted in a MFA press release upon his </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>departure as an effort toward progress on the refugee </p><p>situation.  End note.)  Upon his return to Kathmandu on </p><p>January 28, the Minister will brief the Ambassador on </p><p>developments. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Both Shah and Acharya stressed that they believe the </p><p>Minister\'s visit presents a window of opportunity for </p><p>movement on this contentious issue.  Shah is hopeful that a </p><p>bilateral agreement can be reached by Nepal and Bhutan.  If </p><p>successful, Shah would look for international support to make </p><p>the agreement work.  Acharya said he believes the Nepalis and </p><p>Bhutanese are "just one word away" from reaching an </p><p>agreement.  The text proposed by the Nepalis says that the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) will accept Bhutanese not returning </p><p>to Bhutan for resettlement "according to Nepali law."  The </p><p>Bhutanese, however, insist that the text be amended to read </p><p>"according to Nepali citizenship law."  The issue of </p><p>citizenship is politically charged in Nepal for a number of </p><p>reasons, Acharya observed, including the large volume of </p><p>pending claims from Hindi-speaking residents of the southern </p><p>plains of Indian parentage.  The GON is thus unlikely to </p><p>accede to the Bhutanese demand to change the language, the </p><p>Foreign Secretary concluded. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE VIEW FROM THE EU </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On January 23 the DCM called on EU Charge Rudiger </p><p>Wenk to elicit his views on likely donor positions at the </p><p>upcoming February 17 conference in Geneva (Ref C).  Wenk, who </p><p>has spent more than five years tracking the refugee issue </p><p>from New Delhi and Kathmandu, expressed deep-seated </p><p>skepticism that the Foreign Minister\'s visit to Bhutan will </p><p>result in significant progress to break the logjam.  The </p><p>Bhutanese will doubtless say very positive things during the </p><p>visit, he predicted, but will undertake no follow-up actions. </p><p> Thimpu has no incentive to make concessions, he observed, </p><p>and benefits by deferring substantive action toward a </p><p>resolution.  Many EU member states that are donors to Bhutan </p><p>are nonetheless reluctant to put pressure on Thimpu, </p><p>believing that continued Western support is necessary to </p><p>counterbalance perceived Indian influence and preclude the </p><p>"Sikkimization" of Bhutan.  Even if the donors did decide to </p><p>use their influence to urge a solution to the refugee </p><p>problem, Wenk said Bhutan is unlikely to prove susceptible to </p><p>such pressure because its dependence on foreign aid is fairly </p><p>limited.  That said, the French Government has succeeded in </p><p>putting the refugee issue on the agenda for the Feb. 17 donor </p><p>meeting, he added. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  As an example of dismissive attitudes displayed by </p><p>the Government of Bhutan (GOB) toward donor views, Wenk </p><p>reported that Thimpu has never given the EU Commission a copy </p><p>of the first--and only--verification exercise conducted at a </p><p>refugee camp, even though the EU paid the USD 300,000 tab for </p><p>the undertaking.  EU funds supporting the refugee camps in </p><p>Nepal are set to run out in March, Wenk warned, so the EU </p><p>Commission is eager to see a resolution.  Although the </p><p>Government of Denmark, when serving as head of the EU, sent a </p><p>letter to both the GOB and GON urging a timely resolution to </p><p>the problem, no reply from either government has been </p><p>received, Wenk reported. (Note:  The Danish Charge recently </p><p>told us that Denmark received little support from its </p><p>European colleagues when it tried to bring pressure on Bhutan </p><p>over the refugee issue at last year\'s aid consortium.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Despite his skepticism, Wenk said he welcomes the </p><p>USG desire to press for resolution of the problem.  He said </p><p>that growing donor fatigue makes increasingly questionable </p><p>how the refugees would continue to be fed.  He suggested that </p><p>the EU and the USG formulate a joint approach in preparation </p><p>for the Bhutan aid consortium to be held in Geneva on </p><p>February 17.  He undertook to advise Brussels of USG interest </p><p>in the matter. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>INDIANS PERTURBED </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Wenk said that Indian Ambassador Shyam Saran had </p><p>expressed to him apparent dismay at the USG initiative to </p><p>resolve the crisis.  Because of India\'s open border, </p><p>resettling 100,000 refugees in India would be easy, Saran </p><p>reportedly said (Ref E), although he apparently did not </p><p>suggest that the GOI would consider such a course.  According </p><p>to Wenk, Saran said he fears the USG initiative will relieve </p><p>the GOB of responsibility for resolving the problem.  It is </p><p>all right if part of an eventual solution to the problem </p><p>implies third countries taking a certain number of refugees, </p><p>but proposing actual numbers for ultimate resettlement abroad </p><p>takes the pressure off Bhutan and "pulls the rug out from </p><p>under our (India\'s) feet" in resolving the crisis, Saran </p><p>said.  The Ambassador did not, however, specify what efforts </p><p>the GOI is undertaking to reach a resolution.  (Note:  None </p><p>of our Indian diplomatic colleagues, including Ambassador </p><p>Saran, has expressed similar sentiments directly to us.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) We are somewhat skeptical as well that Foreign </p><p>Minister Shah will return to Nepal with anything concrete </p><p>from his discussions in Thimpu, but welcome GON efforts to </p><p>give the stalled discussions one last jumpstart.  The </p><p>prospects of Nepalese Maoist insurgent attention to the </p><p>camps, coupled with dwindling EU aid--a point we hope will be </p><p>strongly emphasized at the donors\' conference in Geneva--make </p><p>the need for an expeditious resolution to the problem more </p><p>urgent than ever.  Unfortunately, however, the Indian </p><p>Ambassador\'s comments indicate that we may not count on the </p><p>GOI to support our initiative. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
