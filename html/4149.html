(SBU) A new IDB-sponsored diagnosis of structural </p><p>problems in Honduras\'s tax policy documents the failure of </p><p>the GOH to raise sufficient revenues to fund vital state </p><p>functions, resulting in steady growth in the central </p><p>government\'s fiscal deficit.   The authors recommend an </p><p>immediate repeal of extensive tax exemptions and loopholes </p><p>that have reduced the tax base significantly over the years, </p><p>and a long-term structural overhaul of the tax system. </p><p>These sensible and needed recommendations will be </p><p>overwhelmingly difficult to implement in the Honduran </p><p>political context and it remains to be seen how tough the </p><p>IMF will be.  There is high-level political commitment to </p><p>work on an equally important improvement of Honduras\' tax </p><p>administration (collection and audits), with help from the </p><p>U.S. Treasury Department\'s tax administration technical </p><p>assistance office.  The high percentage of Honduran tax </p><p>receipts collected by customs officials indicates that a </p><p>customs service technical assistance project may be needed </p><p>as well.  Washington agencies preparing for U.S.-Central </p><p>American Free Trade Agreement (USCAFTA) negotiations may </p><p>wish to consider carefully our position on GOH tax </p><p>incentives for non-traditional exporters (including U.S. </p><p>companies) in the context of the investment chapter.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Honduran Tax Collection: Too Low, Too Unfair and Too </p><p>Uncontrolled </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) A team of consultants hired by the IDB is currently </p><p>putting the finishing touches on a report entitled </p><p>"Honduras: Toward a More Transparent and Diversified Tax </p><p>System."  The study repeats the recommendations of earlier </p><p>studies and analyses.  It is well-documented, albeit based </p><p>on Honduras\' extremely limited statistical data base, and </p><p>provides policymakers the kinds of details needed to target </p><p>loopholes in Honduran tax law.  Obtaining a substantial </p><p>increase in tax revenues in the near-term is going to be an </p><p>important issue in upcoming Article IV review and discussion </p><p>of a new three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility </p><p>program with the IMF team that is expected to arrive </p><p>November 4.  To ensure adequate attention and coordination </p><p>on this aspect of macroeconomic policy, the USAID mission in </p><p>Honduras has coordinated an extremely useful series of </p><p>meetings of the G-15 Macroeconomic group to evaluate </p><p>Honduras\' tax system.  At a recent meeting of this donor </p><p>group, the key results of the IDB study were presented and </p><p>discussed. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The scope of the problem is fairly clear.  Honduras </p><p>collects (using official measures) taxes equivalent to 16 </p><p>percent of GDP.  Assuming GDP in Honduras is underestimated </p><p>by 35 percent, this tax receipt measure falls to 12 percent </p><p>of GDP using the appropriate estimate of GDP.  The World </p><p>Bank advises that this is only half of the percentage that </p><p>is considered healthy for a developing country.   This level </p><p>of tax collection is not adequate to fund the key government </p><p>services and investment that are needed; growth in tax </p><p>receipts has not kept up with expenditure growth over the </p><p>last ten years, resulting in ever growing deficits (with the </p><p>exception of 1995-98).  The percentage of government </p><p>expenditures that were covered by tax revenues has declined </p><p>from 88 percent of GDP in 1998 to only 63 percent in 2001. </p><p>The tax structure also is highly regressive, since most of </p><p>the tax exemptions are provided to the wealthy.  The poorest </p><p>Hondurans pay a percentage of their income in taxes that is </p><p>75 percent higher than the average taxpayer, whereas the </p><p>richest Hondurans pay a percentage of their income in taxes </p><p>that is 20 percent lower than average. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The IDB consultants noted that the rapid growth in </p><p>the public sector wage bill in recent years (up from 45 </p><p>percent of tax receipts in 1997 to more than 60 percent in </p><p>2001) as a result of the wage provisions in the special </p><p>framework laws (estatutos) for teachers and health service </p><p>professionals.  They also commented that the size of the </p><p>state is not the real problem.  They noted that Honduras\' </p><p>central government budget as a percentage of GDP is smaller </p><p>than even Nicaragua\'s.  The state simply does not collect </p><p>enough revenue.  Finally, the lack of sufficient income has </p><p>led the GOH to fail to transfer five percent of net </p><p>government income to municipalities, as required by the </p><p>Municipality Law that went into effect in January 1991. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) As the GOH began to reduce customs tariffs in 1991 </p><p>in an effort to liberalize trade, the sales tax (a modified </p><p>VAT tax) has gradually grown in importance and now accounts </p><p>for 33 percent of total government tax revenues.  Income tax </p><p>accounts for 22 percent of tax receipts, and taxes on oil </p><p>and oil products come in third, representing 21 percent of </p><p>total taxes.  The 1990s were also a period of export </p><p>promotion, resulting in a web of generous tax incentives for </p><p>textile and apparel companies, mining, and tourism services. </p><p>The IDB team notes that the country has paid a high price </p><p>for these incentives, in terms of transparency, fair </p><p>treatment across taxpaying groups, and control of its own </p><p>tax administration. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Although only 12 percent of tax receipts come from </p><p>import duties, the IDB report notes that 50 percent of all </p><p>tax revenues (including customs duties, sales tax, excise </p><p>taxes, etc.) are collected by the customs service.  Tax </p><p>payments are highly concentrated.  In the year 2000, 703 </p><p>large companies paid 77 percent of the income tax and 1,129 </p><p>large firms accounted for three-quarters of sales tax </p><p>payments. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The IDB study also noted the weakness of the </p><p>Honduran tax and customs service, the DEI.  Although some </p><p>improvements have been made (including the new installation </p><p>of an automated tax payment transfer system integrated with </p><p>the commercial banks, a project paid for by the IDB), there </p><p>remains a great deal of work to do.  Note: The U.S. </p><p>Department of Treasury\'s tax administration technical </p><p>assistance project begins in earnest at the beginning of </p><p>November.  This work will focus on tax collection and </p><p>auditing.  The Treasury experts have recommended that the </p><p>Embassy also contact U.S. Customs about possible technical </p><p>assistance for the DEI\'s customs operations.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Extensive exemptions are provided in almost all the </p><p>tax categories, resulting in a greatly reduced tax base.  A </p><p>wide range of companies receive exemptions from the sales </p><p>tax for purchases of raw materials and other inputs.  As </p><p>result of the granting of extensive exemptions from customs </p><p>duties, revenues from this tax source are only 56 percent of </p><p>the theoretical tax collection (calculated by multiplying </p><p>the value of imports by the appropriate ad valorem tariff). </p><p>In addition, the consultants estimate that 41 percent of </p><p>imported goods enter the country exempt from sales tax as </p><p>well. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Tax incentives have been provided to the majority </p><p>of manufacturing and assembly firms (operating in free trade </p><p>zones of several types) and companies in the tourism, mining </p><p>and energy fields, providing these companies with exemptions </p><p>from customs duties, sales tax, and income tax.  Current </p><p>administration of these exemptions provides ample </p><p>opportunity for abuse.  It is believed that at least one </p><p>firm in the power sector is reselling large quantities of </p><p>fuel to gas stations, instead of using the tax-exempt </p><p>product strictly for electricity generation.  Many goods </p><p>imported duty-free as inputs for assembly or manufacturing </p><p>are instead sold on the retail market. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Solutions Are All Politically Unpalatable </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) The IDB team recommended a series of changes to </p><p>the tax code, for the short term, designed to broaden the </p><p>tax base for the GOH\'s main revenue sources.  They believe </p><p>these measures would increase tax collections by two percent </p><p>of GDP, annually.  The key provisions in this list are the </p><p>elimination or dramatic reduction of tax exemptions and the </p><p>application of minimum amounts of taxes to limit tax </p><p>avoidance schemes.  As these tax exemptions benefit the </p><p>largest and most important companies and individuals in the </p><p>country, and in many cases these changes would be tantamount </p><p>to violation of contractual terms and shifting rules of the </p><p>game for investors, many donors are skeptical that </p><p>sufficient political will exists for major tax policy </p><p>shifts. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) For this reason, some experts are proposing that </p><p>the GOH raise the sales tax in order to increase revenues </p><p>quickly, lower the fiscal deficit, and allow the government </p><p>to reach an agreement with the IMF.  Some of these observers </p><p>cite the case of Chile, in which an eighteen percent tariff </p><p>is applied across the board, with almost no exceptions.  In </p><p>Chile and Mexico, these analysts noted, the sales tax is not </p><p>nearly as regressive as one would think, because the </p><p>elimination of exemptions and incentives ensures that the </p><p>wealthier part of the population is not able to avoid taxes. </p><p>While the simplicity and effectiveness of this approach is </p><p>attractive (and senior advisors in the GOH have noted that </p><p>this was the case when the sales tax was raised from seven </p><p>to twelve percent in 1998), it would put the GOH on the </p><p>political defensive for raising taxes on the poor and </p><p>allowing the rich to continue receiving exemptions. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) We expect that the IMF will push the GOH to </p><p>increase tax revenue in order to help achieve macroeconomic </p><p>stability.  The GOH is well advised to improve its tax </p><p>administration, but this will not be sufficient to achieve </p><p>fiscal balance.  At least some tax exemptions will need to </p><p>be eliminated to help reduce the budget deficit.  While </p><p>raising the sales tax represents a simple alternative, we </p><p>believe it would be politically difficult in the current </p><p>context of high unemployment and slow growth.  The GOH may </p><p>also look to privatization and concessions of government </p><p>infrastructure projects, as a way of both increasing </p><p>government revenues and improving efficiency (currently, the </p><p>only privatization proceeds that are included in the 2003 </p><p>budget are the planned sale of a wireless phone concession). </p><p>The final important factor is economic growth.  If Honduras </p><p>can find a way to improve its investment climate </p><p>sufficiently, it may be able to grow itself out of the </p><p>conundrum it finds itself in. </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
