<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000607 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, YM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01:SANAA FSNS: ANXIETY AND HINTS OF BACKLASH </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 521 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by DCM Alan G. Misenheimer, for reasons 1.5 b </p><p>. and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Sanaa FSNs report heightened worry from </p><p>friends and relatives about their working at U.S. Embassy. </p><p>Several expressed concern that they may unwittingly be the </p><p>means to an attack on US personnel or property, and some feel </p><p>that they themselves may become targets because of their </p><p>association with the U.S. Mission. The Ambassador and DCM </p><p>held a meeting with all the FSNs, and several section chiefs </p><p>have met with their FSNs this week to take the pulse on the </p><p>community, which provides a lens with which to view </p><p>unofficial Yemeni reaction to current events. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Connection with U.S. Mission Questioned </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Several FSNs reported that their spouses, children, </p><p>extended family and friends had expressed heightened concern </p><p>about their working for the American Embassy and coming to </p><p>work this week. They were particularly worried about </p><p>Thursday, March 27th, the first day of the weekend after the </p><p>March 21st violent demonstration.  Many thought that </p><p>demonstrations could begin that afternoon and several </p><p>supervisors were approached concerning Embassy closure that </p><p>day. (Note: Embassy Sanaa did move to StandFast on March 27 </p><p>because of a government sponsored demonstration which was </p><p>peaceful and uneventful. No demonstrations were held on March </p><p>28. End Note.) Other FSNs told us that they do not express </p><p>their political views among friends and family, and in some </p><p>cases try not to speak of their association with the Embassy. </p><p> In one case, a third country FSN who may have been mistaken </p><p>for an American had rocks thrown at her by children on the </p><p>way to the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Fears of Violence Increasing </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) One FSN reported going to "Al-Aql" mosque on Friday, </p><p>March 21 and said that he would not have been surprised if </p><p>worshipers had committed violence had the Imam called on them </p><p>specifically to do so. He said people were very upset, and </p><p>the Imam had compared US actions to the Mongols sacking </p><p>Baghdad. Another FSN in a different section reported that he </p><p>felt that the average person may be increasingly inclined </p><p>towards violence.  He added that the anger is still there, it </p><p>is just not being expressed.  FSNs also reported feeling more </p><p>vulnerable in their commutes to and from the Embassy, fearing </p><p>that they may be watched and could be targeted for their </p><p>association with post. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Work Relationships </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Some working relationships with ROYG officials and </p><p>other Yemeni contacts, according to several FSNs in different </p><p>sections, have broken down.  Requests for information have </p><p>been put off, or delayed, and some are feeling some backlash. </p><p>Pol/Econ FSNs requested that we hold off on making new </p><p>appointments right now due to political sensitivities. </p><p>However, one of the development FSNs reported that this </p><p>contacts at the Ministry of Health actively encouraged U.S. </p><p>development activities to proceed at full speed in order to </p><p>complete projects already underway. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Supervisors have been extremely impressed with our </p><p>FSN\'s sense of loyalty and committment to the mission.  Post </p><p>affirms that while some of the external working relationships </p><p>may have cooled, we have not seen any such reaction from our </p><p>FSN employees. FSNs have been working at home during </p><p>temporary Embassy closures, worked weekends to feed staff </p><p>quartered in the Embassy, and provided valuable information </p><p>while security procedures have curtailed much outside </p><p>activity for the American community. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Reaction to Increased Security Measures for FSNS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador met with FSNs on March 25 to discuss </p><p>new security concerns and to gauge public reaction to the war </p><p>in Iraq.   The Ambassador listened to all of their concerns </p><p>and assured our FSNs that their concerns were being addressed </p><p>and the FSNs were an integral part of the Mission team.  New </p><p>security procedures (Ref cable) involve increased screening </p><p>for FSNs entering the building and moving FSN parking outside </p><p>of the Embassy compound.  One FSN said, "I don\'t care if they </p><p>check me seven or eight times, security is for everyone." On </p><p>March 26, Ambassador walked the Embassy perimeter with RSO, </p><p>FSN committee representatives and Central Security </p><p>Organization (CSO) on-site commander. A useful security </p><p>exercise, it also served as a morale booster for our FSNs who </p><p>work inside the Embassy, our Local Guard Force (LGF) and the </p><p>CSO soldiers assigned to protect us. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment: With heightened security procedures for </p><p>American personnel limiting our outside contacts, post has </p><p>become more reliant upon the information provided by our </p><p>FSNs. This summary of their experiences provides a glimpse </p><p>into the mood of Sanaa. End Comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
