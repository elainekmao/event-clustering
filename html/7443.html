<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000767 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ADCO, ADPM, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: FM QIRBI ON THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH, EMBASSY </p><p>VEHICLES, AND NON-DIPLOMATIC PLATES </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 339 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Edmund J. Hull, Ambassador for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  Ambassador and Foreign Minister Abu Bakr </p><p>al-Qirbi discussed problems plaguing the diplomatic pouch, </p><p>outstanding vehicle exemption requests and the shortage of </p><p>non-diplomatic "blue" license plates during an April 12 </p><p>meeting on various subjects (septels).  Ambassador criticized </p><p>the lack of ROYG consistency and stressed the need for a </p><p>swift resolution to avoid wider ramifications.  FM Qirbi </p><p>agreed to contact his ROYG counterparts to get these issues </p><p>resolved.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Diplomatic Pouch </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ambassador highlighted the latest diplomatic pouch </p><p>run on April 11 as another example of ROYG inconsistency.  He </p><p>noted that post did everything ROYG requested and even sent </p><p>people to the airport on 4/10 to make sure preparations were </p><p>complete.  Regardless, there were still new requirements on </p><p>April 11 when the pouches arrived.  Ambassador added that </p><p>post now faces a situation that will require even larger </p><p>shipments just to catch-up with the backlog. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Noting that this impasse is continuing to draw </p><p>attention in Washington, Ambassador delivered a non-paper </p><p>outlining an April 4th incident in which diplomatic couriers </p><p>were physically prevented from performing their duties -- one </p><p>sustaining minor injuries while trying to maintain possession </p><p>of the pouch. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  After hearing the details of the April 4th incident, </p><p>FM Qirbi said he would raise the issue during a meeting with </p><p>PSO Chief Gamish scheduled for later that afternoon (4/12). </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Vehicle Exemptions </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Ambassador called FM Qirbi\'s attention to four </p><p>pending vehicle exemptions at the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, all of which are for armored vehicles.  Ambassador </p><p>highlighted the Embassy\'s need for additional armored </p><p>vehicles to maintain a strong security posture, and advised </p><p>that, due in part to the Embassy\'s growth because of </p><p>increased U.S.-Yemen cooperation, additional vehicle </p><p>exemption requests for both armored and personal vehicles </p><p>would be forthcoming.  Qirbi acknowledged the importance of </p><p>maintaining security, but made no commitment to streamline </p><p>the process. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>"Blue" License Plates </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  When discussion turned to the shortage of blue </p><p>(non-diplomatic) license plates, FM Qirbi immediately denied </p><p>MFA involvement in their issuance.  Ambassador countered that </p><p>the Ministry of Interior, the only other player in the </p><p>process, said that the MOI has no objection to the release of </p><p>these plates, the implication being that unresolved problems </p><p>were to be dealt with by the MFA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Qirbi replied that he would raise this issue with </p><p>the Minister of Interior later that day (4/12).  The </p><p>Ambassador welcomed Qirbi\'s involvement and added that the </p><p>Embassy is trying to help ROYG by making U.S. officials </p><p>harder targets -- by removing easily identifiable diplomatic </p><p>plates and replacing them with regular blue plates. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
