(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS JAMES BRUNO; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE HAS BEEN </p><p>CLOISTERED AT COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS THIS PAST </p><p>WEEK, DELIBERATING ON THE FATE OF GENERAL SECRETARY </p><p>PHIEU AND A NEW LEADERSHIP LINE-UP.  IN THIS "SECOND </p><p>SESSION" OF THE 11TH PLENUM, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HAS </p><p>BEEN TRYING TO FORGE CONSENSUS SO THE OPENING OF THE </p><p>NINTH PARTY CONGRESS CAN BE FINALIZED AND, IF </p><p>POSSIBLE, A NEW "TROIKA" OF LEADERS FORMALIZED AT THAT </p><p>TIME.  THE LATTER IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN, THOUGH, AS A </p><p>BROAD MIX OF CANDIDATES IS BEING PUSHED BY DIFFERENT </p><p>GROUPS OF SENIOR LEADERS.  MOREOVER, THE LEADERS HAVE </p><p>ALREADY ANNOUNCED THERE WILL BE AT LEAST ONE MORE </p><p>PLENUM BEFORE THE CONGRESS, AND COMMENTS IN THE MEDIA </p><p>ABOUT THE POLITICAL REPORT AND ECONOMIC PROGRAM </p><p>SUGGEST THEY ARE STILL BEING MODIFIED BY "GOOD IDEAS" </p><p>FROM THE LOCAL LEVELS.  WE JUDGE IT LIKELY PHIEU WILL </p><p>BE REPLACED, THOUGH PERHAPS NOT AT THE CONGRESS IF A </p><p>SUCCESSOR CANNOT BE AGREED UPON.  PHIEU REPORTEDLY IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00638  01 OF 06  190945Z </p><p>FIGHTING HARD FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE; HIS SPEECH </p><p>OPENING THE PLENUM EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR FUTURE </p><p>LEADERS TO BE OF THE HIGHEST INTEGRITY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY (CONT\'D): HANOI PARTY CHIEF TRONG, CPV </p><p>ORGANIZATION DIRECTOR AN, PRESIDENT LUONG AND NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY SPEAKER MANH ARE MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED AS </p><p>PHIEU\'S POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS.  DEPUTY PM DUNG SEEMS THE </p><p>MOST LIKELY OF THE SOUTHERN "REFORMERS" TO TAKE THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER SLOT.  THE FATE OF THE SENIOR ADVISORS </p><p>IS STILL UP IN THE AIR; THEY CONTINUE TO PLAY </p><p>PROMINENT ROLES IN THE JOCKEYING FOR NEW LEADERSHIP </p><p>SLOTS.  WITH THEIR RESURGENT INFLUENCE, IT LOOKS </p><p>INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY THEY WILL GO QUIETLY INTO THE </p><p>NIGHT.  WHOEVER IS LEFT STANDING IN THE POLITBURO AT </p><p>THE END, THIS COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>MUDDLE THROUGH WITH ITS GRADUAL APPROACH TO REFORM. </p><p>SINCE CONSENSUS PLAYS SUCH A PARAMOUNT ROLE IN THEIR </p><p>DECISION-MAKING, WE DO NOT EXPECT DRAMATIC CHANGES IN </p><p>THE SHORT TERM NO MATTER WHO IS CHOSEN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PLENUM FOCUSED ON LEADERSHIP </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) WITH THE THREE SENIOR ADVISORS LOOKING ON FROM </p><p>THE FRONT ROW, COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU OPENED THE SECOND </p><p>SESSION OF THE 11TH PLENUM MARCH 13 BY NOTING THE </p><p>PARTY WOULD CONTINUE ITS DISCUSSION OF PERSONNEL </p><p>ISSUES FOR THE UPCOMING NINTH PARTY CONGRESS.  PHIEU, </p><p>WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE FIGHTING FOR THIS POLITICAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00638  01 OF 06  190945Z </p><p>LIFE, SAID THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE NEEDED TO PUT FORWARD </p><p>LEADERSHIP CANDIDATES WHO "REPRESENT THE PARTY\'S WILL </p><p>AND INTELLIGENCE AND WHO POSSESS ADEQUATE POLITICAL </p><p>AND MORAL BACKGROUND, A DEEP SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY, </p><p>AND COMPETENCE IN LEADERSHIP AND IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>POLICIES."  HE STRESSED IT WAS NECESSARY "TO ENSURE </p><p>INHERITANCE AND CONTINUITY OF PARTY LEADERSHIP AND </p><p>POLITICAL STABILITY" WHILE WORKING TO ADVANCE THE "DOI </p><p>MOI" RENOVATION PROCESS.  PHIEU SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT </p><p>THAT THE NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE MUST NOT INCLUDE ANYONE </p><p>OF BAD CHARACTER, GUILTY OF "OPPORTUNISM, GREED, POOR </p><p>DISCIPLINE, DISUNITY, BUREAUCRATISM, CORRUPTION, </p><p>INCOMPETENCE AND IRRESPONSIBILITY." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) IN ADDITION TO LEADERSHIP QUESTIONS, THE PLENUM </p><p>HAS FOCUSED ON THE KEY CPV DOCUMENTS TO BE PRESENTED </p><p>AT THE CONGRESS -- THE POLITICAL REPORT, 5-YEAR AND </p><p>10-YEAR ECONOMIC PLANS, AND THE PARTY STATUTE.  IN HIS </p><p>REMARKS PHIEU NOTED THE CPV HAS RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF </p><p>LETTERS AND COMMENTS FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- </p><p>RANGING FROM STUDENTS TO RETIREES AND WAR VETERANS -- </p><p>RESPONDING TO THE PARTY\'S CALL FOR FEEDBACK ON THE </p><p>DRAFT POLITICAL REPORT RELEASED FEB. 3.  PHIEU CLAIMED </p><p>THE CPV WILL COLLATE ALL THE IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS </p><p>PRESENTED, AND WILL "INCORPORATE" THESE IDEAS IN </p><p>REVISING THE REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) IN HIS REMARKS, PHIEU NOTED THE CPV "DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE MUCH TIME FOR THIS PLENUM."  TENTATIVELY THIS </p><p>PLENUM IS SCHEDULED TO GO UNTIL MARCH 20.  PHIEU ALSO </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT A 12TH PLENUM WILL BE HELD BEFORE THE </p><p>CPV CONGRESS.  REPORTS HAVE BEEN CIRCULATING FOR SOME </p><p>TIME IN HANOI THAT THE CONGRESS MIGHT BE HELD IN EARLY </p><p>APRIL, BUT BECAUSE OF APPARENT DIFFICULTY IN REACHING </p><p>AGREEMENT ON LEADERSHIP CHANGES, WE HAVE RECENTLY </p><p>HEARD REPORTS THE CONGRESS COULD SLIP TO JUNE.  A BUSY </p><p>SCHEDULE OF ASEAN MEETINGS HANOI IS HOSTING IMPINGES </p><p>ON THE CALENDAR IF THERE IS MUCH DELAY.  (HANOI IS </p><p>HOSTING ASEAN SENIOR OFFICIALS\' MEETINGS IN MID-MAY, </p><p>WITH THE ASIAN MINISTERIAL, POST-MINISTERIAL AND ASEAN </p><p>REGIONAL FORUM MEETINGS IN LATE JULY.) </p><p> </p><p>PHIEU ON THE DEFENSIVE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ONE OF THE GREAT DRAMAS OF THIS PLENUM SESSION </p><p>IS THE FATE OF PHIEU AND WHETHER HE WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>HOLD ON TO HIS JOB.  IN OCTOBER LAST YEAR, THE THREE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00638  02 OF 06  190946Z </p><p>SENIOR ADVISORS, INCLUDING HIS FORMER MENTOR LE DUC </p><p>ANH, CIRCULATED A LETTER AMONG THE LEADERSHIP ACCUSING </p><p>PHIEU OF LACKING ABILITY IN MANAGEMENT OF PARTY AND </p><p>STATE AFFAIRS.  DIFFERENT THEORIES CIRCULATE IN HANOI </p><p>AS TO WHAT CAUSED ANH IN PARTICULAR TO TURN AGAINST </p><p>HIS FORMER PROTEGE.  SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT PHIEU </p><p>LOCKED THE GVN INTO A BAD DEAL WITH THE CHINESE ON </p><p>BORDER DEMARCATION WITHOUT FULLY CONSULTING HIS </p><p>COLLEAGUES.  OTHERS POINT TO HIS OVERALL LACK OF </p><p>MANAGEMENT ABILITY AND VISION.  (COMMENT: WE BELIEVE A </p><p>KEY FACTOR MAY BE THAT PHIEU "OVERREACHED" IN HIS </p><p>EXPLORATORY EFFORTS TO ASSUME THE ROLE OF STATE </p><p>PRESIDENT AS WELL AS GENERAL SECRETARY, A LA JIANG </p><p>ZEMIN IN CHINA.  SUCH A MOVE, WIDELY AND GENERALLY </p><p>FAVORABLY DISCUSSED UNTIL LAST FALL, WOULD HAVE BEEN A </p><p>DRAMATIC DEPARTURE FOR THE HIGHLY CONSENSUAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE CPV, WITH ITS LONG HISTORY OF A </p><p>CAREFULLY BALANCE AMONG SENIOR LEADERS.  PHIEU MAY </p><p>HAVE LOST ANH\'S SUPPORT AND THAT OF OTHER ADVISORS AND </p><p>POLITBURO LEADERS IN PART BECAUSE OF PERCEIVED HUBRIS </p><p>THAT HE WANTED TOO MUCH POWER.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) WHATEVER THE PROXIMATE CAUSE, IT APPEARS CLEAR </p><p>THAT ONCE THE SENIOR ADVISORS SIGNALED THEIR </p><p>DISAPPROVAL OF PHIEU\'S PERFORMANCE, THIS OPENED THE </p><p>FLOODGATES TO DIFFERENT GROUPS WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP </p><p>WHO HAD VARIOUS GRIEVANCES AGAINST HIM.  THESE </p><p>INCLUDE, ON THE ONE HAND, THE POWERFUL UNIFORMED </p><p>MILITARY, WHO HAVE NEVER CLAIMED PHIEU AS ONE OF THEIR </p><p>OWN.  (NOTE: PHIEU MADE HIS CAREER AS A POLITICAL </p><p>COMMISSAR IN THE ARMY AND WAS SEEN AS NOT ADVANCING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00638  02 OF 06  190946Z </p><p>THE MILITARY\'S INTERESTS WHILE GENERAL SECRETARY.  IN </p><p>THIS REGARD, THE SWEDISH DCM SAID SHE WAS RECENTLY AT </p><p>A GATHERING OF CPV AND MILITARY OFFICIALS WHOM SHE HAS </p><p>KNOWN FOR YEARS.  THE EXTENT OF ANTIPATHY TO PHIEU WAS </p><p>STRIKING.  IN HER PRESENCE, TWO OF THE MILITARY CADRE </p><p>SPOKE OUT PUBLICLY AND SAID HE NEEDED TO GO.  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) REFORMERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, RESENT PHIEU\'S </p><p>HIGHLY IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS AND HIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO </p><p>REFORM; THEY POINT TO HIS CLUMSY REMARKS TO PRESIDENT </p><p>CLINTON, HIS LACK OF VISION, AND HIS CONTINUAL HARPING </p><p>ON "SELF-CRITICISM," A STAPLE THROWBACK OF LENINIST </p><p>CONTROL.  (OTHERS CRITICIZE THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IT </p><p>HAS BEEN SO INEFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH MALFEASANCE </p><p>AND CORRUPTION IN THE RANKS OF PARTY AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS.)  AND THERE ARE, OF COURSE, ALSO MANY </p><p>PERSONALISTIC REASONS WHY INDIVIDUAL LEADERS HAVE </p><p>GRIEVANCES AGAINST PHIEU; HE MADE ENEMIES, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, BY GOING AFTER ALLIES OF PM KHAI SUCH AS </p><p>NGUYEN THAI NGUYEN, WHO WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH </p><p>BEING A SPY FOR CHINA.  (COMMENT: ARGUABLY, THE </p><p>PERSONALISTIC REASONS -- OF SELF-INTEREST, PERSONAL </p><p>RIVALRY AND GRIEVANCE -- MAY BE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL. </p><p>IDEOLOGY OFTEN SEEMS TO TAKE A BACK SEAT HERE TO OTHER </p><p>MOTIVATIONS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>JOCKEYING OVER THE BIG THREE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE WIDE RANGE OF OPPOSITION TO PHIEU SUGGESTS </p><p>HE WILL NOT SURVIVE LONG IN HIS POSITION.  AFTER THE </p><p>FIRST SESSION OF THE 11TH PLENUM IN JANUARY, THERE </p><p>WERE CREDIBLE REPORTS HE HAD OFFERED TO STEP DOWN. </p><p>ONE ACCOUNT OF A STRAW POLL AMONG POLITBURO MEMBERS </p><p>REVEALED ONLY ONE MEMBER -- PHIEU HIMSELF -- </p><p>SUPPORTING HIS CONTINUING IN HIS JOB.  OTHER REPORTS </p><p>SUGGESTED OTHER POLITBURO MEMBERS -- INCLUDING </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER NONG DUC MANH, HANOI PARTY </p><p>CHIEF NGUYEN PHU TRONG, AND CPV ORGANIZATION DIRECTOR </p><p>NGUYEN VAN AN -- ENJOYED MUCH HIGHER JOB APPROVAL AND </p><p>WERE POSSIBLE CANDIDATES TO REPLACE HIM. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS, HANOI HAS BUZZED WITH </p><p>WIDELY VARYING SCENARIOS ABOUT WHO AMONG THE POLITBURO </p><p>WOULD ASCEND TO PHIEU\'S JOB, AS WELL AS THE OTHER TWO </p><p>"TROIKA" POSITIONS -- PRESIDENT AND PRIME MINISTER. </p><p>THESE SCENARIOS REVOLVE AROUND DIFFERENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00638  03 OF 06  190946Z </p><p>CONFIGURATIONS OF THE FOLLOWING: HANOI PARTY CHIEF </p><p>TRONG, CPV ORGANIZATION DIRECTOR AN, PRESIDENT LUONG, </p><p>ASSEMBLY SPEAKER MANH, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER DUNG, AND </p><p>HO CHI MINH CITY PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN MIEN TRIET. </p><p>TRONG, AN, LUONG AND MANH SEEM THE MOST CREDIBLE </p><p>CANDIDATES FOR GENERAL SECRETARY. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) WHILE NONE OF THESE LEADERS STANDS OUT AS A </p><p>PROHIBITIVE FAVORITE, TRONG CERTAINLY IS A LEADING </p><p>CONTENDER TO REPLACE PHIEU.  TRONG HEADED THE CPV\'S </p><p>IDEOLOGY DEPARTMENT AND BEFORE THAT WAS EDITOR OF THE </p><p>"COMMUNIST REVIEW."  AS HANOI PARTY CHIEF HE OCCUPIES </p><p>A GOOD VANTAGE POINT FOR LOBBYING HIS CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES.  THIS PAST YEAR, TRONG HAS </p><p>SERVED AS HEAD OF THE PLATFORM COMMITTEE DRAFTING THE </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL REPORT FOR THE CPV CONGRESS. </p><p>HIS IS A STRONGLY IDEOLOGICAL VOICE THAT WOULD ENSURE </p><p>CONTINUITY AT THE TOP -- AND IDEOLOGICAL "BALANCE" TO </p><p>MORE TECHNOCRATIC MEMBERS LIKELY TO FILL THE OTHER TWO </p><p>SLOTS.  WHEN HE MET THE AMBASSADOR LAST YEAR FOR A </p><p>COURTESY CALL AFTER MONTHS OF REQUESTS, TRONG REVEALED </p><p>LITTLE ABOUT HIMSELF.  HE CHATTED STIFFLY ABOUT </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN HANOI AND HIS COMMENTS WERE TYPICAL OF </p><p>CPV JARGON.  HIS DEMEANOR MATCHED HIS REPUTATION: ONE </p><p>OF THOSE SUSPICIOUS OF THE U.S. AND INSISTENT THAT </p><p>REFORM MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH VIETNAM\'S SOCIALIST </p><p>HERITAGE. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) RECENTLY NGUYEN VAN AN, WHO HAS BEEN IN THE </p><p>SHADOWS OF INTERNAL CPV AFFAIRS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS, HAS RE-EMERGED TO CHALLENGE FOR THE TOP CPV </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00638  03 OF 06  190946Z </p><p>SLOT.  AN WAS A FINALIST FOR THE GENERAL SECRETARY </p><p>SLOT IN DECEMBER 1997, WHEN PHIEU WON OUT IN A CLOSE </p><p>VOTE WITHIN THE POLITBURO.  AS HEAD OF THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE\'S ORGANIZATION DEPARTMENT, AN LIKEWISE </p><p>OCCUPIES AN IMPORTANT POST WITHIN THE PARTY AND </p><p>SOURCES SUGGEST HE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY INVOLVED IN </p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE CONGRESS IN RECENT MONTHS.  ONE </p><p>SOURCE WITH CLOSE FAMILY CONNECTIONS TO SENIOR CPV </p><p>LEADERS TOLD US THAT SENIOR ADVISORS LE DUC ANH AND VO </p><p>VAN KIET REPORTEDLY ARE UNITING BEHIND AN AS THEIR </p><p>FAVORED CANDIDATE FOR GENERAL SECRETARY.  UNDER THIS </p><p>SCENARIO, IF AN ASCENDS TO THE TOP SPOT, THE THREE </p><p>SENIOR ADVISORS WOULD MAINTAIN THEIR POSITIONS AS </p><p>"EMINENCE GRIS" OVERSEEING MATTERS FROM THE WINGS. </p><p>(AT THIS POINT, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE SENIOR </p><p>ADVISORS WILL RETAIN THEIR FORMAL ROLES.  ONE OF THE </p><p>REPORTED CONDITIONS RAISED EARLIER REGARDING PHIEU\'S </p><p>DISMISSAL WAS FOR THE THREE ADVISORS TO STEP DOWN AND </p><p>FOR THOSE POSITIONS TO BE ABOLISHED.  UP TO NOW, </p><p>HOWEVER, THEY CONTINUE TO EXERCISE CONSIDERABLE </p><p>INFLUENCE IN THE PRESENT DELIBERATIONS.)  AS </p><p>DOCUMENTED IN PREVIOUS EMBASSY REPORTING ABOUT </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBERS, AN IS ONE OF THOSE LEADERS WHO IS </p><p>LARGELY HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC AND FOREIGN OBSERVERS. </p><p>WE DO NOT HAVE A GOOD TAKE ON HIS IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>BEARINGS. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) BOTH PRESIDENT LUONG AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>SPEAKER MANH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED REPEATEDLY IN THE </p><p>PAST MONTHS AS POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR OTHER TOP JOBS. </p><p>BOTH COULD BE POSSIBLE COMPROMISE CANDIDATES TO MOVE </p><p>TO GENERAL SECRETARY, ALTHOUGH NEITHER HAS THE PROFILE </p><p>ONE WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT FOR THE JOB.  LUONG IS A </p><p>LOW-KEY TECHNOCRAT WHO LONG SERVED AS A DEPUTY PM AND </p><p>HAS GOTTEN GENERALLY GOOD REVIEWS FOR HIS SERVICE AS </p><p>PRESIDENT; MANH IS FINISHING TWO TERMS AS SPEAKER, AND </p><p>IS RANKED BY HIS PEERS AS ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR CPV </p><p>LEADERS.  (COMMENT: NEITHER OF THESE TWO IS </p><p>PARTICULARLY DYNAMIC, BUT IN VIETNAM\'S POLITICAL </p><p>CUPOLA, SOMETIMES "STEADY, SOLID BLANDNESS" IS AN </p><p>ATTRACTIVE ATTRIBUTE.  END COMMENT.)  MANH, AN ETHNIC </p><p>TAY WHO IS THE LONE MINORITY MEMBER IN THE POLITBURO, </p><p>COULD EITHER BENEFIT OR BE HURT BY LAST MONTH\'S </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  SOME IN THE </p><p>CPV MAY SEE HIS ELEVATION -- EITHER TO GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY OR PRESIDENT -- AS A WAY TO MAKE A SYMBOLIC </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>GESTURE TO THE COUNTRY\'S MINORITIES.  ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, WE HAVE HEARD COMMENTS FROM ETHNIC KINH CADRE IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00638  04 OF 06  190946Z </p><p>HANOI THAT SUCH A MOVE WOULD NOT SIT WELL WITH THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S MAJORITY. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) DUNG, AS FIRST DEPUTY PM, IS THE MOST LOGICAL </p><p>CANDIDATE TO MOVE UP TO PRIME MINISTER, THOUGH SOME </p><p>RECENT SCENARIOS EVEN SUGGEST PM KHAI COULD BE </p><p>PERSUADED TO STAY ON IN THAT POSITION FOR A SHORT </p><p>INTERIM.  DUNG, SEEN BY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND </p><p>MANY WESTERN OBSERVERS AS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING OF </p><p>THE NEXT GENERATION OF REFORMERS, REPORTEDLY MAY FACE </p><p>OPPOSITION AMONG MORE IDEOLOGICAL MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  IDEOLOGICAL MEMBERS CAUTIOUS ON REFORM </p><p>MIGHT PREFER A POTENTIALLY LESS DYNAMIC PM; FOR THIS </p><p>GROUP, A "SAFER" CHOICE MIGHT BE THE TECHNOCRATIC </p><p>LUONG, WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS DEPUTY PM.  (NOTE: A </p><p>VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE TAUGHT DUNG IN </p><p>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL INSISTS HE DID NOT GRADUATE FROM </p><p>JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.  END NOTE.)  ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>TRIET HAS EARNED STRONG KUDOS FROM THE REFORM CAMP FOR </p><p>HIS LEADERSHIP IN HCMC, AND HE IS A PLAUSIBLE </p><p>CANDIDATE, AS IS FORMER HCMC PARTY CHIEF TRUONG TAN </p><p>SANG, NOW IN HANOI AS HEAD OF THE CPV ECONOMIC </p><p>COMMISSION.  ONE OF SANG\'S 1997 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR </p><p>CPV LEADERS TO DISCLOSE THEIR WEALTH HAS NOW BEEN </p><p>RESURRECTED FOR INCLUSION IN THIS YEAR\'S CPV </p><p>DOCUMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) AS THE ABOVE SUGGESTS, THE RANGE OF </p><p>COMBINATIONS IS WIDE, AND IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN </p><p>THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE WILL BE ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT </p><p>ON SUCCESSORS TO THE CURRENT TEAM.  IN FACT, GIVEN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00638  04 OF 06  190946Z </p><p>DIFFICULTIES IN REACHING CONSENSUS AMONG DISPARATE </p><p>FACTIONS, WE HAVE HEARD FROM SEVERAL PARTY-CONNECTED </p><p>SOURCES THAT THE MOST LIKELY RESULT AT PRESENT IS THAT </p><p>THE CPV CONGRESS MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL JUNE, WITH THE </p><p>CURRENT THREE LEADERS REMAINING IN PLACE FOR THE TIME </p><p>BEING.  THE POLISH AMBASSADOR HEARD FROM A SENIOR CPV </p><p>CONTACT THAT A JUNE CONGRESS LOOKS LIKELY AT THIS </p><p>POINT, AND IN FACT, PHIEU MAY INTENTIONALLY BE </p><p>DRAGGING OUT THE STALEMATE IN THE HOPES OF BUYING TIME </p><p>FOR HIM TO STAY IN PLACE BECAUSE OF DEADLOCK. </p><p> </p><p>RETIREMENT COMING SOON FOR OTHERS IN THE POLITBURO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) WHEREAS THE FATE OF THE TOP THREE LEADERS </p><p>REMAINS UNCERTAIN, A NUMBER OF OTHER POLITBURO MEMBERS </p><p>CLEARLY ARE SLATED FOR RETIREMENT FROM THE POLITBURO. </p><p>(NAMING NEW LEADERS TO GOVERNMENT POSTS WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>BE "FORMALIZED" BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, THOUGH THE </p><p>REAL DECISIONS ARE TAKEN BY THE CPV.)  THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE DECIDED AT ITS LAST PLENUM SESSION TO </p><p>REQUIRE THOSE POLITBURO MEMBERS OVER 70 YEARS OLD TO </p><p>RETIRE (THOUGH IT LEFT OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW </p><p>EXCEPTIONS) AND TO ENCOURAGE THOSE OVER 65 TO STEP </p><p>DOWN.  AMONG THOSE REPORTEDLY RETIRING ARE FATHERLAND </p><p>FRONT HEAD PHAM THE DUYET, DEPUTY PM NGUYEN MANH CAM </p><p>(WHO HAD BEEN MENTIONED AS A POSSIBLE VICE PRESIDENT), </p><p>LONG-TIME HEAD OF THE HO CHI MINH POLITICAL ACADEMY </p><p>NGUYEN DUC BINH, AND CPV IDEOLOGY HEAD (AND FORMER </p><p>HANOI PARTY CHIEF) LE XUAN TUNG.  DUYET\'S STATUS HAS </p><p>BEEN DEBATED FOR MONTHS, BUT IT NOW APPEARS HE WILL BE </p><p>EASED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) RUMORS CIRCULATE ABOUT POSSIBLE RETIREMENT FOR </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER PHAM VAN TRA AND MINISTER OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY LE MINH HUONG.  BOTH OF THEM HAVE RUMORED TO </p><p>BE ON THE WAY OUT BEFORE, BECAUSE OF AGE AND IN </p><p>HUONG\'S CASE, REPORTS OF SOME HEALTH PROBLEMS. </p><p>HOWEVER, BOTH OF THEIR MINISTRIES ARE IMPORTANT </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL POWERS WITHIN THE VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP, </p><p>AND THEIR SLOTS WOULD CERTAINLY BE FILLED BY THEIR </p><p>SUCCESSORS, IF THEY DO INDEED STEP DOWN.  CHIEF OF THE </p><p>ARMY\'S GENERAL STAFF LE VAN DUNG CERTAINLY IS A </p><p>CANDIDATE BY POSITION TO REPLACE TRA AS DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER (AND THUS ON THE POLITBURO), BUT HE IS SEEN </p><p>AS UNSOPHISTICATED BY MANY OF HIS KEY PEERS.  (DAO HAS </p><p>HEARD FROM SEVERAL SOURCES THAT DUNG EARNED HIS STARS </p><p>HEROICALLY ON THE BATTLEFIELD, BUT HIS PRESENT WORK AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00638  05 OF 06  190947Z </p><p>CHIEF OF STAFF SEEMS A VALIDATION OF THE "PETER </p><p>PRINCIPLE.")  LT. GENERAL PHAM THANH NGAN IS WIDELY </p><p>SEEN AS A RISING FIGURE AMONG THE NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>OFFICIALS IN THE CPV.  HE HOLDS PHIEU\'S OLD POSITION </p><p>AS POLITICAL COMMISSAR OF THE MILITARY; HE ALSO </p><p>PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS AIR FORCE COMMANDER.  WE EXPECT </p><p>HE WILL REMAIN IN THE LEADERSHIP AND IS A CANDIDATE TO </p><p>RISE IN INFLUENCE.  BECAUSE OF HIS CLOSE TIES TO </p><p>PHIEU, HOWEVER, HE MIGHT BE HURT BUREAUCRATICALLY IF </p><p>THE GENERAL SECRETARY IS FORCED TO STEP DOWN NOW. </p><p>CONVERSELY, HE MIGHT RISE AS A QUID PRO QUO FOR </p><p>PHIEU\'S STEPPING DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) FOR OTHERS AMONG THE LEADERSHIP, IT IS EVEN </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO GAUGE.  NGUYEN THI XUAN MY, </p><p>THE ONLY WOMAN EVER APPOINTED TO THE POLITBURO, IS IN </p><p>CHARGE OF THE CPV CONTROL COMMITTEE, AND IN THIS </p><p>CAPACITY COULD BE BLAMED FOR ONGOING CORRUPTION IN CPV </p><p>RANKS.  ONE LONG-TIME FOREIGN OBSERVER PREDICTS SHE </p><p>WILL RETIRE.  (HOWEVER, THE GVN HAS INDICATED ITS </p><p>INTEREST IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND OTHER HIGHLY VISIBLE POSITIONS, </p><p>AND THIS SUGGESTS SHE MIGHT REMAIN -- OR BE REPLACED </p><p>BY ANOTHER PROMINENT WOMAN LEADER.)  PHAN DIEN, PARTY </p><p>CHIEF IN DANANG, HAS PRESENTED A CONFIDENT IMAGE TO </p><p>WESTERN VISITORS WHO HAVE MET HIM IN RECENT MONTHS, </p><p>SUCH AS THE AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR, AND WE SPECULATE HE </p><p>WILL REMAIN ON THE POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>POLICY CONTINUITY RATHER THAN DRAMATIC CHANGES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00638  05 OF 06  190947Z </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OF THE POLITICAL REPORT AND </p><p>FIVE- AND TEN-YEAR ECONOMIC PLANS SUGGEST THERE WILL </p><p>BE NO DRAMATIC CHANGES COMING OUT OF THE PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS.  AND IN FACT THAT IS WHAT ONE NORMALLY </p><p>EXPECTS OUT OF THIS POLITICAL SYSTEM.  THE PARTY\'S </p><p>ENTIRE PROCESS OF "CONSULTATION" OVER A WHOLE YEAR, </p><p>INVOLVING COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION BY CPV CADRE AT ALL </p><p>LEVELS AND BY OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED "PUBLIC" VOICES, </p><p>TENDS TO MAKE THE PARTY CONGRESS DOCUMENTS A BIT OF </p><p>ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE POLITICAL </p><p>REPORT HAS SECTIONS ON EVERYTHING INCLUDING BUILDING </p><p>AND REFINING SOCIALISM, HOW TO REFORM SOES, HORTATORY </p><p>STATEMENTS ABOUT DEFENDING NATIONAL SECURITY, AND HOW </p><p>TO PROMOTE AN AUTHENTICALLY VIETNAMESE CULTURE </p><p>RENAISSANCE.  TAKEN AS A WHOLE, IT DOESN\'T GIVE MUCH </p><p>OF A GUIDE FOR SPECIFIC ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) AS WE HAVE NOTED BEFORE IN OUR REPORTING, ONE </p><p>OF THE POSITIVES WE SEE IN THE DOCUMENTS IS AN </p><p>INCREASED RECOGNITION OF VIETNAM\'S NEEDS TO EMBRACE </p><p>THE POTENTIAL INHERENT IN THE "KNOWLEDGE-BASED </p><p>ECONOMY."  THIS FOCUSES BOTH ON DEVELOPING AND </p><p>MARKETING VIETNAM\'S HUMAN RESOURCES POTENTIAL IN TERMS </p><p>OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE </p><p>OF VIETNAMESE CITIZENS.  THIS IS REFLECTED PRACTICALLY </p><p>IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S NASCENT EFFORTS TO DEVELOP GREATER </p><p>CAPACITIES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING SUCH </p><p>INITIATIVES AS BREAKING GROUND ON HIGH-TECH PARKS IN </p><p>HO CHI MINH CITY AND HANOI AND IN EFFORTS TO REPLICATE </p><p>BANGALORE\'S OUTSOURCING OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE. </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) THE CONGRESS, HOWEVER, IS UNLIKELY TO RESULT </p><p>IN ANY DRAMATIC BOOST TO THE ECONOMIC REFORM AGENDA. </p><p>MUCH MORE INFLUENTIAL OVER TIME, BY FAR, WILL BE THE </p><p>ROLLING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT AS ECONOMIC REFORMERS IN KEY MINISTRIES AND </p><p>OFFICES (AND INDEED MORE PROGRESSIVE REGIONS SUCH AS </p><p>GREATER HO CHI MINH CITY) PRESS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>TARGETS IN THEIR AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY.  BY </p><p>CONTRAST, THE CONGRESS IS MUCH MORE ABOUT CONTINUITY </p><p>THAN CHANGE.  IN ADDITION, SEEMINGLY TOTALLY DIVORCED </p><p>FROM THE PARTY\'S RHETORIC, THE GVN HAS SIGNED AN IN- </p><p>PRINCIPLE AGREEMENT ON A NEW STRUCTURAL PROGRAM WITH </p><p>THE IMF AND THE WORLD BANK.  THE TIMING OF THE SIGNING </p><p>OF THIS AGREEMENT INDICATES THE REFORMERS WANT TO </p><p>ASSURE THE STRUCTURAL PROGRAM IS A "FAIT ACCOMPLI" FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00638  06 OF 06  190947Z </p><p>THE PARTY CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) REPORTS COMING OUT OF THE FIRST HALF OF THE </p><p>11TH PLENUM SUGGEST THAT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE IS </p><p>LEANING TOWARD ABOLITION OF THE FIVE-MEMBER POLITBURO </p><p>STANDING BOARD AS UNWORKABLE AND INSTEAD RETURNING TO </p><p>A SECRETARIAT THAT WILL STAFF THE WORK OF THE </p><p>POLITBURO.  WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DECISION-MAKING IS </p><p>UNCLEAR.  DECISIONS BY THE WHOLE POLITBURO INSTEAD OF </p><p>A STANDING COMMITTEE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE ANY MORE </p><p>ENLIGHTENED, EFFECTIVE, OR TIMELY.  AND, IT IS </p><p>UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE SECRETARIAT WOULD HAVE ANYTHING </p><p>OTHER THAN "STAFF" RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: MORE OF THE SAME </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) COMMENT: IF ALL GOES ACCORDING TO FORM, THE </p><p>BIGGEST DECISION OF THIS PLENUM LIKELY WILL BE "NO </p><p>DECISION."  WHILE WE JUDGE THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT </p><p>AMONG MOST OF THE CPV LEADERSHIP THAT PHIEU SHOULD GO, </p><p>IT IS MUCH LESS CLEAR A CONSENSUS CAN BE FORGED ON HIS </p><p>SUCCESSOR.  THAT IS LIKELY TO TAKE SOME MORE TIME, AND </p><p>WE FIND VERY CREDIBLE THE REPORTS WE HEAR THAT THE </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS MAY SLIP UNTIL AS LATE AS JUNE.  AND </p><p>EVEN THEN, THERE MAY BE NO AGREEMENT ON THE TOP SLOTS. </p><p>THE LACK OF CONSENSUS AMONG THIS STALEMATED </p><p>LEADERSHIP, WHICH IS ADDICTED TO "CONSENSUS" DECISIONS </p><p>THAT INVOLVE LEAST-COMMON-DENOMINATOR GRADUALISM, </p><p>SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT AN UNPOPULAR PHIEU COULD </p><p>MANAGE TO HOLD ON FOR PERHAPS EVEN ANOTHER YEAR OR SO, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00638  06 OF 06  190947Z </p><p>BEING REPLACED WELL AFTER THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS. </p><p>THE PRECEDENT EXISTS FOR SUCH A MIDTERM REPLACEMENT, </p><p>SINCE PHIEU HIMSELF WON OUT OVER AN IN A SPLIT </p><p>POLITBURO VOTE IN DECEMBER 1997, SOME 18 MONTHS AFTER </p><p>THE EIGHTH CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) IN ANY EVENT, ONE THING IS CERTAIN: THERE WILL </p><p>BE NO DRAMATIC POLICY CHANGES COMING OUT OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS.  WE WILL SEE A GRADUAL </p><p>CHANGE OF EMPHASIS, PERHAPS, AND IN TIME GENERATIONAL </p><p>CHANGE WILL BRING (HOPEFULLY) FRESHER PERSPECTIVES TO </p><p>THE FORE.  BUT IN THE SHORT TERM, THE NEW COLLECTIVE </p><p>POLITBURO LIKELY WON\'T ACT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE </p><p>CURRENT VERSION.  IT WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO BALANCE </p><p>THE DISPARATE "FACTIONS" OF THIS DIVIDED CPV BY </p><p>MUDDLING THROUGH WITH ITS OXYMORONIC "STATE-LED </p><p>MARKET-ORIENTED SOCIALIST DEVELOPMENT."  END COMMENT. </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
