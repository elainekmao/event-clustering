"Sabah" </p><p>reports that 240 PKK/KADEK militants have already applied to </p><p>Turkish officials to take advantage of the law.  213 of the </p><p>applicants are from  Turkey, and the remaining 27 are living </p><p>abroad.  Meanwhile, the US welcomed the law and issued a </p><p>call to PKK militants urging them to take advantage of it. </p><p>"Radikal" quotes US Embassy Charge d\'Affaires Robert Deutsch </p><p>as saying that `the law will work to Turkey\'s benefit, and </p><p>the US is pleased with it.\'   Most papers report the </p><p>reaction from the Foreign Ministry to claims that top PKK </p><p>militants will be sent to political asylum in Norway.  FM </p><p>Gul and Foreign Ministry spokesman Dirioz said that reports </p><p>of the asylum plan are false, and that an exile formula for </p><p>PKK/KADEK leaders would be totally unacceptable.  The </p><p>Norwegian Ambassador to Turkey also denied the allegations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Troop Deployment:  "Milliyet" gives extensive, front-page </p><p>coverage to the troop deployment issue.  The "Milliyet" </p><p>headline reads `the nightmare is back.\'  The government </p><p>faces trouble in convincing President Sezer and AKP deputies </p><p>to support the measure.  Some cabinet ministers are also </p><p>against a Turkish troop deployment in Iraq, the paper </p><p>reports.  Although PM Erdogan fully supported a troop </p><p>deployment before the Iraq war, he is now largely avoiding </p><p>the issue.  The PM said that the issue is `not on </p><p>government\'s agenda.\' Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc said </p><p>that `the parliament will make the best decision if a new </p><p>motion is presented.  However, I hope no one will act </p><p>without taking into account the will of the Turkish people.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7th Harmonization Package:  All papers cover the approval of </p><p>the 7th EU reform package.  "Radikal" says that the package </p><p>is a new step for enhancing democracy in Turkey.  With the </p><p>acceptance of the package, parliamentary control over </p><p>military spending has increased, and the NSC\'s powers have </p><p>been constrained.  Also, the authority to coordinate NSC </p><p>recommendations has been transferred from the NSC Secretary </p><p>General to one of the Deputy Prime Ministers.  The NSC </p><p>Secretary General will be nominated by the Prime Minister </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>and appointed with the approval of the President.  If the </p><p>nominated Secretary General is a military official, then the </p><p>approval of the General Staff will also be required. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The PKK must see the facts" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand commented in the mass appeal Hurriyet </p><p>(7/31): "Necmettin Kerim, a prominent figure of the Kurdish </p><p>lobby in Washington, believes that the PKK\'s life span in </p><p>Northern Iraq is over. .  The Americans know that it will be </p><p>impossible to improve relations with Turkey as long as a PKK </p><p>camp remains in Northern Iraq.  Washington has declared the </p><p>PKK to be a terrorist organization, and announced that the </p><p>U.S. is working to eliminate terrorism in Iraq. There will </p><p>be no foreign forces left in Northern Iraq, neither Turkish </p><p>troops nor the PKK nor Islamist groups. .  The Americans </p><p>expect that, once the repentance law takes effect, some 500- </p><p>1,000 PKK members will be disarmed and sent to Turkey. </p><p>Those who refuse to lay down their arms will be disarmed and </p><p>moved out of Iraq by CENTCOM.  The PKK\'s leadership cadre -- </p><p>some 100 people -- will be sent to Scandinavian countries as </p><p>refugees. American officials have reportedly obtained </p><p>approval of the idea in principle from Norway and other </p><p>Scandinavian countries. According to Kerim, the PKK must end </p><p>its armed struggle. It must leave DEHAP alone. If it is </p><p>going to take part in politics, it must do so within the </p><p>law. .  The PKK-KADEK must see the facts and take a </p><p>decision." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey, Iraq democracy axis" </p><p>Cengiz Candar wrote in the mass appeal DB-Tercuman (7/31): </p><p>"Bringing democracy to Iraq is tough. It will be painful and </p><p>take time. .  The ideal regime for Iraq would be a </p><p>federalist secular democracy. .  We should be aware of the </p><p>fact that the U.S. has made possible the opening of a new </p><p>period in Iraq, the Middle East, and the Islamic world. </p><p>Turkey\'s national interest requires the implementation of </p><p>democracy in Iraq.  Cooperation with the Americans to that </p><p>end is obligatory." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"New era with Syria" </p><p>Sami Kohen opined in the mass appeal Milliyet (7/31): "There </p><p>is no serious obstacle to improving bilateral relations </p><p>between Turkey and Syria.  The U.S., having put Syria on a </p><p>blacklist, is unwilling to see Turkey and Syria move closer </p><p>to one another.  However, Ankara can play a role in </p><p>eliminating some of the disagreements between the U.S. and </p><p>Syria. .  Syrian Prime Minister Miro signed four economic </p><p>cooperation agreements with Turkey during his Ankara visit. </p><p>The trade volume between the two countries is estimated at </p><p>around $1 billion in 2003. .  A new era of strategic </p><p>relations might begin between Syria and Turkey." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
