O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOZ hikes fuel price again </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary:  In an attempt to alleviate severe </p><p>shortages, the GOZ has approximately tripled gas and </p><p>doubled diesel prices.  Economic impact will be </p><p>substantial.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Leaded petrol\'s controlled price rises Z$ 145 to </p><p>450 and diesel Z$ 119 to 200.  It was a politically- </p><p>charged act that Zimbabwe\'s business community has </p><p>lobbied hard for.  Since the Zimdollar began a steep </p><p>slide and Libya halted fuel deliveries in late 2002, </p><p>Zimbabweans have grown accustomed to waiting days, even </p><p>weeks, for subsidized fuel.  Nearly all serious </p><p>businesses and organizations already import fuel at </p><p>international rates. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Time will tell if today\'s price hikes shrink fuel </p><p>queues.  Pent-up demand is enormous.  At Z$ 450 (US$ </p><p>.33)/liter, some Zimbabwean motorists will be unable to </p><p>afford fuel.  To assist commuter vans and lessen residue </p><p>on poorer Zimbabweans, the GOZ left diesel at the highly- </p><p>subsidized rate of Z$ 200 (US$ .15)/liter. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment:  With today\'s decision, the GOZ </p><p>continues its slow-footed steps toward economic </p><p>liberalization.  It\'s the latest in a series of recent </p><p>positive moves, but - in isolation - too little to stem </p><p>the country\'s rapid economic descent.  We will continue </p><p>to analyze the repercussions as the dust settles, but </p><p>offer a few initial observations: </p><p> </p><p>- The GOZ is still unwilling to get out of the fuel- </p><p>subsidy business, a practice it can no longer afford.  At </p><p>Z$ 600-650, the industry estimates that Zimbabwean </p><p>consumers will pay international rates.  At the new </p><p>prices, at least, the GOZ can subsidize a greater amount </p><p>of fuel or divert resources to food and energy. </p><p> </p><p>- The increase will yank Zimbabwe\'s 228 percent inflation </p><p>rate upward.  The GOZ\'s oft-stated goal of double-digit </p><p>inflation by the year\'s end is further out of reach. </p><p> </p><p>- Mounting inflation will make it even harder for </p><p>producers to sell at controlled prices.  The GOZ will be </p><p>under heavier pressure to relax price controls. </p><p> </p><p>- Although people here will find these prices hard to </p><p>stomach, President Mugabe has provided no leadership </p><p>through public appearances or statements to guide the </p><p>country through this painful transition.  Economic </p><p>distortions, such as the fuel subsidy, conceal </p><p>Zimbabweans\' impoverishment.  Each time the price of a </p><p>commodity nears international norms, Zimbabweans </p><p>appreciate more fully how their wealth has plummeted. </p><p>This realization may cause them to turn on the Government </p><p>that brought this about, possibly translating into </p><p>support for the opposition Movement for Democratic </p><p>Change\'s recent calls for mass action. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
