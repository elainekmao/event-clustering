HE HAS THREATENED TO </p><p>THROW HIMSELF FROM THE TREE, IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAKES </p><p>ANY ACTION AGAINST HIS PROPERTY.  ACCORDING TO CONTACTS, </p><p>POLICE HAVE SURROUNDED AND BARRICADED HIS PAGODA.  HOA HAO </p><p>BELIEVERS, A SIZABLE NUMBER OF WHOM WORSHIP AT LIEM\'S </p><p>PRIVATE PAGODA ON A REGULAR BASIS, HAVE GATHERED OUTSIDE TO </p><p>MONITOR THE SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) ON NOVEMBER 6, A HOA HAO ORGANIZATION IN THE U.S. </p><p>NOTIFIED POST THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAD ORDERED NAM </p><p>LIEM TO REMOVE THE GATE TO HIS PROPERTY IN AN GIANG </p><p>PROVINCE\'S CHO MOI DISTRICT.  HOA HAO BELIEVERS HEAVILY </p><p>POPULATE THIS DISTRICT.  TWO RESPECTED HOA HAO ELDERS IN HO </p><p>CHI MINH CITY VERIFIED THE U.S.-ORIGINATED INFORMATION BY </p><p>COMMUNICATING WITH SOURCES ON THE GROUND NEAR NAM LIEM\'S </p><p>HOME.  SURPRISINGLY, NEITHER OF THE HCMC ELDERS HAD HEARD </p><p>ABOUT THE INCIDENT UNTIL POST CONTACTED THEM.  ONE OF THE </p><p>ELDERS REPORTED THAT LOCAL POLICE HAD VISITED HIM ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 6 - A MOVE HE NOW INTERPRETED AS INTENDED TO </p><p>INTIMIDATE HIM FROM TRAVELING TO AN GIANG.  THIS ELDER </p><p>STATED THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER TAKING ACTION IF OFFICIALS </p><p>DID ANYTHING TO HARM NAM LIEM OR REMOVE THE GATE.  HE ADDED </p><p>THAT HOA HAO BELIEVERS IN AN GIANG WERE PREPARED TO DO THE </p><p>SAME. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) NAM LIEM FIRST CLIMBED UP A TREE AND STAYED THERE </p><p>FOR FOUR DAYS IN 1994, AFTER POLICE CAME TO ARREST HIM FOR </p><p>CONSTRUCTING PARTS OF HIS PRIVATE PAGODA, INCLUDING THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01140  110628Z </p><p>GATE, WITHOUT A BUILDING LICENSE.  HE SERVED A FOUR-YEAR </p><p>PRISON SENTENCE FOLLOWING THAT INCIDENT, BUT NEVER REMOVED </p><p>THE GATE.  UPON HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON, HE WELCOMED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RECOGNITION OF THE HOA HAO, ALTHOUGH HE LATER </p><p>BECAME DISILLUSIONED WITH THE GVN-SANCTIONED HOA HAO </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  IN NOVEMBER 2001, NAM LIEM WENT UP THE SAME </p><p>TREE WITH GASOLINE AND A KNIFE IN RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE HOA HAO FLAGS AND OTHER INSIGNIA FROM </p><p>HIS GATE.  HE WAS NOT ARRESTED THE SECOND TIME, BUT </p><p>MUTILATED HIS OWN LEG, BEFORE EVENTUALLY COMING DOWN FROM </p><p>THE TREE VOLUNTARILY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THIS TIME, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT PROMPTED THE LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO ACT -- NAM LIEM\'S DISPLAY OF CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>HOA HAO INSIGNIA ON HIS GATE, OR PREVIOUS CONCERNS OVER THE </p><p>UNLICENSED CONSTRUCTION, THOUGH THE ONE CERTAINLY </p><p>EXACERBATES THE OTHER.  (POST NOTE: PER REFTEL, PREVIOUS </p><p>POLOFF WAS PREVENTED FROM VISITING NAM LIEM IN JUNE 2002, </p><p>BY A GANG OF YOUNG MEN BLOCKING THE PATH TO HIS PAGODA IN A </p><p>THREATENING MANNER.)  ALTHOUGH THE HOA HAO ELDERS IN HCMC </p><p>ARE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION, THEY HAVE NOT </p><p>ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE OR INQUIRIES ON OUR PART.  POST WILL </p><p>DO ITS BEST TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
