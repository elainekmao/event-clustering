(C) POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS SPOKEN OUT FORCEFULLY AND </p><p>CONSISTENTLY AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM IN EUROPE AND AGAINST </p><p>SPECIFIC ANTI-SEMITIC ACTS.  HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH\'S SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM -- IN </p><p>PART BASED ON THE CHURCH\'S SELF-ACKNOWLEDGED HISTORICAL </p><p>&SIN8 OF PROMOTING ANTI-JUDAISM (RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION) </p><p>IN EUROPE. THROUGHOUT HIS PONTIFICATE, THE POPE HAS SOUGHT TO </p><p>TURN THIS AWARENESS OF PAST ERRORS INTO A RESOLVE TO OVERCOME </p><p>THIS HISTORICAL ANTI-JUDAISM AND TO COMBAT EUROPEAN </p><p>ANTI-SEMITISM (ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION).  TO THIS END, THE POPE </p><p>HAS RADICALLY TRANSFORMED THE HOLY SEE\'S RELATIONS WITH JEWS, </p><p>REDEFINING THE JEWISH RELIGION AS INTRINSIC TO CHRISTIANITY </p><p>AND PART OF A COMMON HERITAGE, WHILE ACTIVELY DEEPENING THE </p><p>CHURCH\'S DIALOGUE WITH JEWS.  BUILDING ON THE SECOND VATICAN </p><p>COUNCIL\'S REAPPRAISAL OF CATHOLICISM\'S RELATIONSHIP TO </p><p>JUDAISM, THE HOLY SEE HAS TAKEN SYSTEMIC MEASURES TO ADDRESS </p><p>ITS ROLE IN HISTORICAL ANTI-SEMITISM AND TO CHANGE ITS </p><p>PRACTICE.  ASIDE FROM PUBLIC AND DOCTRINAL STATEMENTS, IT </p><p>ACTIVELY PROMOTES AN AWARENESS OF THE ERROR OF ANTI-JUDAISM </p><p>AND ANTI-SEMITISM IN ITS MANY CATHOLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS. </p><p>THESE TENETS ARE ALSO PROMOTED BY BISHOPS\' CONFERENCES IN </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ARE PREACHED REGULARLY THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>CONTINENT.  CATHOLIC LAY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY ENGAGE IN FREQUENT DIALOGUE AND </p><p>EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH, WITH THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE HOLY SEE. </p><p> END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>JPII:  AN ACTIVIST AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05545  01 OF 04  141510Z </p><p>2. (U) JOHN PAUL II\'S EFFORTS TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM STEM IN </p><p>PART FROM HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCES GROWING UP IN A TOWN WITH </p><p>A LARGE JEWISH POPULATION, DEFENDING JEWISH FRIENDS FROM </p><p>ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACKS, AND WITNESSING HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN </p><p>AND WOMEN BEING SHIPPED TO NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMPS.  FROM </p><p>THE POPE\'S EARLY STUDIES HE CAME TO THE VIEW THAT </p><p>ANTI-SEMITES WERE ANTI-CHRISTIAN.  SUBSEQUENTLY, HE DEVELOPED </p><p>A STRONG PERSONAL CONVICTION OF THE INHERENT DIGNITY OF ALL </p><p>HUMAN BEINGS; AND THREATS TO THIS DIGNITY HAVE ALMOST BECOME </p><p>PERSONAL "CAUSES" FOR THIS POPE.  THE POPE HAS ASSERTED THAT </p><p>THE CHURCH MUST ATONE FOR THE HISTORICAL EXISTENCE OF </p><p>ANTI-JUDAISM IN CHRISTIAN EUROPE THAT AT LEAST IN PART </p><p>CREATED A FOUNDATION FOR THE RACIAL ANTI-SEMITISM OF THE </p><p>TWENTIETH CENTURY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) IT IS THEREFORE NO COINCIDENCE THAT UNDER JOHN PAUL II </p><p>THE VATICAN HAS UNDERTAKEN NUMEROUS SYMBOLIC AND PRACTICAL </p><p>STEPS TO BUILD ON VATICAN II REFORMS AND REACH OUT TO JEWS -- </p><p>MOST DRAMATICALLY WHEN THE POPE VISITED ROME\'S SYNAGOGUE IN </p><p>1986, AND JERUSALEM\'S WAILING WALL IN 2000.  IN FACT, WHEN </p><p>POPE JOHN PAUL II STEPPED INTO ROME\'S SYNAGOGUE IN APRIL </p><p>1986, HE WAS THE FIRST POPE IN 1,900 YEARS TO TAKE THAT STEP. </p><p> THROUGHOUT HIS PONTIFICATE, HE HAS MERGED SUCH DRAMATIC, </p><p>SYMBOLIC STEPS, SUCH AS HIS VISIT TO AUSCHWITZ IN POLAND, </p><p>WITH A NEW CONCEPTUAL APPROACH TO CATHOLIC-JEWISH RELATIONS </p><p>EMBODIED IN AN ARRAY OF STATEMENTS AND EXHORTATIONS.  THESE </p><p>STATEMENTS, WHICH BEGAN WITH THE SECOND VATICAN COUNCIL\'S </p><p>NOSTRA AETATE IN 1965 AND INCLUDE "WE REMEMBER:  A REFLECTION </p><p>ON THE SHOAH," HAVE EMPHASIZED THE CHURCH\'S REJECTION OF ALL </p><p>FORMS OF PERSECUTION, ITS SHARED SPIRITUAL HERITAGE WITH </p><p>JUDAISM, AND A RECOGNITION OF AND REPENTANCE FOR PAST ERRORS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05545  01 OF 04  141510Z </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>WHAT THE HOLY SEE IS DOING </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE CHURCH HAS ORGANIZED ITSELF SINCE VATICAN II TO </p><p>ENGAGE IN AN OPEN DIALOGUE WITH OTHER FAITHS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>ORTHODOX, BUT IN PARTICULAR, WITH THE JEWISH FAITH. </p><p>REFLECTING THE POPE\'S COMMITMENT, HE HAS PUT SOME OF HIS BEST </p><p>PEOPLE ON THIS TASK.  GERMAN CARDINAL WALTER KASPER, ONE OF </p><p>THE VATICAN\'S MOST OPEN AND PERCEPTIVE INTERLOCUTORS, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, HEADS THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR CHRISTIAN UNITY, </p><p>WHICH INCLUDES RESPONSIBILITY FOR DIALOGUE WITH JEWS, AND IS </p><p>CHARGED WITH FOSTERING A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH </p><p>RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS.   KASPER SAID OCTOBER 18, IN REFERENCE </p><p>TO OPENING THE HOLOCAUST-ERA VATICAN ARCHIVES, THAT THE </p><p>CHURCH SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO CONFRONT ITS PAST.  MORE </p><p>RECENTLY, ON NOVEMBER 6 HE OFFERED A THREE-POINT ACTION PLAN </p><p>FOR THE ON-GOING FIGHT AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM FOCUSING ON </p><p>REVISING RELIGIOUS AND EDUCATIONAL TEXTS, INCREASING PERSONAL </p><p>ENCOUNTERS WITH JEWISH PEOPLE, AND STUDYING JEWISH HISTORY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO8477 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05545  02 OF 04  141511Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  DHS-00   EPAE-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------086D95  141519Z /38 </p><p>R 141356Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 VATICAN 005545 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR-BJONES AND EUR/WE-MENNUTI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, VT, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE EFFORTS TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM IN EUROPE </p><p> </p><p>5.    (U) BEYOND KASPER\'S DIALOGUE, THE HOLY SEE IS HIGHLY </p><p>ATTUNED TO ANY INCIDENT THAT MIGHT SMACK OF RESURGENT </p><p>ANTI-SEMITISM.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE POPE QUICKLY SENT A MESSAGE </p><p>WHEN IT SEEMED JEWISH GRAVES IN ROME\'S VERANO CEMETERY HAD </p><p>BEEN DESECRATED EARLIER THIS YEAR (REF A).  THE POPE\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP IN THIS REGARD IS REFLECTED IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF </p><p>THE EUROPEAN CATHOLIC BISHOPS\' CONFERENCES, WHICH HAVE EITHER </p><p>ISSUED DOCUMENTS OR MADE STATEMENTS IN THE MEDIA CONDEMNING </p><p>ANTI-SEMITISM GENERALLY AND SPECIFIC ANTI-SEMITIC ACTS. </p><p>EUROPEAN BISHOPS CONFERENCES WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05545  02 OF 04  141511Z </p><p>AGAINST ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACKS, AS THE FRENCH BISHOPS DID WHEN </p><p>SYNAGOGUES IN FRANCE WERE DESECRATED IN APRIL THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>6.    (U) AT THE OSCE, VATICAN FOREIGN POLICY ACTIVELY </p><p>SUPPORTS AND PROMOTES RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND TOLERANCE IN </p><p>EUROPE.  WHILE DEFENDING ITS OWN INTERESTS AND POSITION, IT </p><p>EMBRACES THE CAUSES OF ALL OTHER RELIGIONS FOR MUTUAL </p><p>BENEFIT.  THE HOLY SEE\'S REPRESENTATIVE IS WORKING WITH US TO </p><p>ENSURE RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION OR ANTI-SEMITISM ARE </p><p>CONDEMNED BY THE OSCE, AND THAT THE ORGANIZATION PUTS </p><p>PRESSURE ON OFFENDING GOVERNMENTS TO AMEND LEGISLATION AND </p><p>PRACTICES. </p><p> </p><p>7.    (U) THE RECENT ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INSTITUTE FOR </p><p>INTER-RELIGIOUS STUDIES AT THE PONTIFICAL GREGORIAN </p><p>UNIVERSITY AND THE OPENING OF THE LIBRARY FOR STUDIES IN </p><p>JUDAISM RUN BY THE SISTERS OF SION REFLECTS THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH\'S CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING UNDERSTANDING OF </p><p>NON-CHRISTIAN RELIGIONS, ESPECIALLY JUDAISM.  WE EXPECT MORE </p><p>CATHOLIC INSTITUTES OF HIGHER LEARNING TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMS </p><p>TO STUDY JUDAISM IN THE YEARS AHEAD.  EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO BE A KEY COMPONENT OF THE HOLY SEE\'S EFFORTS </p><p>TO COUNTER ANTI-SEMITISM.  IN 1985, THE HOLY SEE RELEASED </p><p>"NOTES ON THE CORRECT WAY TO PRESENT THE JEWS AND JUDAISM IN </p><p>PREACHING AND CATECHESIS," A PRIMER DESIGNED TO PUT AN </p><p>DEFINITIVE END TO TEACHING OF JEWISH CULPABILITY IN CHRIST\'S </p><p>DEATH.  CENTURIES OF MISUNDERSTANDING WILL NEVERTHELESS TAKE </p><p>TIME TO CORRECT, BUT THE HOLY SEE\'S EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS ARE </p><p>CONTRIBUTING TO THAT PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  BEYOND THE VATICAN WALLS BUT WORKING CLOSELY WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05545  02 OF 04  141511Z </p><p>THEM, ROME\'S SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY (WHICH FOCUSES ON RELIEF </p><p>AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION AROUND THE WORLD) HAS MAINTAINED A </p><p>TWENTY-YEAR DIALOGUE WITH JUDAISM.  ON THE OCTOBER 16 </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPORTATION OF ROME\'S JEWS TO NAZI </p><p>EXTERMINATION CAMPS, SANT\'EGIDIO FOUNDER ANDREA RICCARDI </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT JEWS ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF ROME\'S </p><p>IDENTITY.  RICCARDI WARNED THAT "NEW WINDS OF ANTI-SEMITISM" </p><p>WERE BLOWING INTO EUROPE, AND SAID IT WAS KEY TO STAND IN </p><p>SOLIDARITY WITH THE JEWS AND NEVER AGAIN TO ABANDON THEM. </p><p>RICCARDI, A RESPECTED HISTORIAN, MENTIONED A NUMBER OF </p><p>ANTI-SEMITIC INCIDENTS THAT HAVE PEPPERED ROME\'S RECENT PAST. </p><p> RICCARDI ALSO REPRESENTED THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY AT A </p><p>MEMORIAL EVENT AT ROME\'S CITY HALL WHERE HE SPOKE ABOUT THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING HISTORY IN FIGHT AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM. </p><p> THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY HOSTS THIS ANNUAL COMMEMORATION </p><p>AND CONDUCTS DURING THE YEAR A NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL TRIPS </p><p>FOR ITALIAN CHILDREN TO THE ROME SYNAGOGUE AND JEWISH SCHOOL, </p><p>WITH THE FULL SUPPORT AND BACKING OF THE HOLY SEE ITSELF.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, IT CONDUCTS AN IMPRESSIVE ANNUAL INTER-RELIGIOUS </p><p>DIALOGUE ENCOUNTER WITH ACTIVE HOLY SEE AND JEWISH </p><p>PARTICIPATION AIMED AT FOSTERING UNDERSTANDING AND </p><p>EMPHASIZING COMMON VALUES OF DIVERSE FAITHS IN THE SPIRIT OF </p><p>THE POPE\'S 1986 ASSISI INTER-FAITH INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>CURIAL VIEWS DIFFER ON STATE OF EUROPEAN ANTI-SEMITISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) DESPITE THE REAL PROGRESS MADE OVER THE LAST FORTY </p><p>YEARS IN THE VATICAN\'S RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM AND THE STRONG </p><p>LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE OF POPE JOHN PAUL II, THE POPE\'S AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05545  02 OF 04  141511Z </p><p>KASPER\'S ENTHUSIASM IS NOT ALWAYS REFLECTED FROM ALL PARTS OF </p><p>THE CURIA.  INDEED, SOME REMAIN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE THREAT OF </p><p>RESURGENT ANTI-SEMITISM, REGARDING RECENT ATTACKS PRIMARILY </p><p>AS A REACTION OF DISAFFECTED MOSLEM IMMIGRANTS TO THE </p><p>SITUATION IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES.  AS ONE  CONTACT </p><p>ASSERTED: "WHEN ISRAEL WITHDRAWS FROM THE TERRITORIES THE </p><p>ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACKS WILL GO AWAY." </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) MOREOVER, ANTI-JUDAIC AND ANTI-SEMITIC SENTIMENTS </p><p>HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETELY ERADICATED FROM THE EUROPEAN MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE CURIA.  IN A FEW CASES, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED EUROPEAN </p><p>CURIAL OFFICIALS WHO HAVE MANIFESTED REMNANTS OF ANTI-SEMITIC </p><p>SENTIMENTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, AN OLDER DESK OFFICER OF FRENCH </p><p>ORIGIN COMPLAINED TO POLOFF THAT THE USG\'S STRONG INTEREST IN </p><p>MODERN EUROPEAN ANTI-SEMITISM STEMMED FROM THE "EXCESSIVE </p><p>INFLUENCE OF JEWS IN YOUR MEDIA AND GOVERNMENT."  HE WENT ON </p><p>TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE VATICAN SHARES USG CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>RESURGENT EUROPEAN ANTI-SEMITISM, BUT THAT IT WASN\'T QUITE AS </p><p>WORRIED AS THE USG APPEARED TO BE.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>JEWISH COMMUNITY IN EUROPE WAS NOW SO FULLY INTEGRATED THAT </p><p>THEIR JEWISHNESS IS MORE A RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION THAN A </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5731 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05545  03 OF 04  141511Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  PERC-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      ECA-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------086DA4  141519Z /38 </p><p>R 141356Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 VATICAN 005545 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

ANOTHER SENIOR CURIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE ON ONE OCCASION TOLD A PREVIOUS AMBASSADOR </p><p>THAT THE VATICAN\'S LEGAL PROBLEMS STEMMING FROM THE HOLOCAUST </p><p>ASSETS REPORT (REF B) WERE THE RESULT OF "JEWISH JUDGES </p><p>HAVING TOO MUCH INFLUENCE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>JEWISH/ISRAELI PERSPECTIVES ON HOLY SEE EFFORTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05545  03 OF 04  141511Z </p><p>11. (C) IN A NOVEMBER 13 CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR, </p><p>RICCARDO DI SEGNI, CHIEF RABBI OF ROME, PRAISED THE HOLY SEE </p><p>FOR ITS ROLE IN DENYING ANTI-SEMITES A THEOLOGICAL BASIS FOR </p><p>THEIR PREJUDICE.  HE SAID THAT THE VATICAN II REFORMS HAVE </p><p>"CUT THE TREE AT ITS ROOTS -- BUT THE ROOTS ARE STILL THERE, </p><p>WAITING FOR WATER."  IN THAT REGARD HE BELIEVED THAT POPE </p><p>JOHN PAUL\'S HIGHLY SYMBOLIC GESTURES SUCH AS THE 1986 VISIT </p><p>TO THE ROME SYNAGOGUE HAD DONE MUCH TO EDUCATE THE ITALIAN </p><p>AND EUROPEAN PUBLIC.  REGARDING THE SCOPE OF THE </p><p>ANTI-SEMITISM PROBLEM, DE SEGNI MAINTAINED THAT EACH COUNTRY </p><p>HAS TO BE ANALYZED IN ITS OWN RIGHT.  HE AGREED THAT MANY </p><p>RECENT ANTI-SEMITIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN </p><p>FRANCE, RESULTED LARGELY FROM FRUSTRATIONS OF DISAFFECTED </p><p>IMMIGRANT YOUTHS FROM NORTH AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  SUCH </p><p>ATTACKS, HE SAID, WERE UNKNOWN IN ITALY.  THE FRENCH </p><p>PHENOMENON WITH ITS MIDDLE EAST LINKS, HE BELIEVED, WAS </p><p>DIFFERENT FROM THE HISTORIC ANTI-SEMITISM THAT STILL EXISTS </p><p>IN EUROPE.  CITING LOCAL SOCCER HOOLIGANS\' USE OF THE WORD </p><p>"JEW" AS AN EPITHET, DE SEGNI INDICATED THAT ITALIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES NEEDED TO WORK HARDER BOTH TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC </p><p>AND CREATE A MORE JUST ECONOMIC ORDER, SO THAT MARGINALIZED </p><p>PEOPLE DO NOT MISTAKENLY TARGET JEWS TO EXPRESS THEIR </p><p>DISAFFECTION. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) OUR ISRAELI EMBASSY CONTACTS ALSO WELCOMED THE POPE\'S </p><p>PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM AND HIS MANY </p><p>IMPORTANT SYMBOLIC ACTS DURING HIS PAPACY.  THEY NOTED THAT </p><p>THE COMMITMENT TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM WAS INCORPORATED IN </p><p>THE "FUNDAMENTAL ACT" AGREEMENT THAT FORMED THE BASIS OF </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND ISRAEL, AND WAS </p><p>THUS BOTH A LEGAL AND MORAL COMMITMENT FOR THE HOLY SEE.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05545  03 OF 04  141511Z </p><p>ISRAELI EMBASSY HAS IN RECENT TIMES FOUND THE HOLY SEE SLOWER </p><p>TO RAISE ITS VOICE IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC ACTS AND RELUCTANT </p><p>TO REPEAT ITS CONDEMNATIONS OF ANTI-SEMITISM OUT OF FEAR THAT </p><p>SUCH STATEMENTS WOULD BE INTERPRETED IN THE ARAB WORLD AS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENTS POLICIES IN THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES.  THE ISRAELI EMBASSY CONTINUES TO EMPHASIZE THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THESE ISSUES SEPARATE, AND RECENTLY </p><p>FOUND SUPPORT FROM CARDINAL ROGER ETCHEGARAY, WHO PUBLICLY </p><p>STATED THAT CRITICISM OF ISRAELI POLICIES MUST NEVER SLIP </p><p>INTO REDUCED VIGILANCE AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM.  THE EMBASSY, </p><p>FOR ITS PART, IS WORKING WITH THE HOLY SEE TO DEVELOP </p><p>EDUCATIONAL AND EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AND TO SUPPORT THE STUDY OF </p><p>JUDAISM AT CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES.  DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, </p><p>ISRAEL\'S RELATIONS WITH THE HOLY SEE ARE CURRENTLY COOL AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S HARD-LINE TACTICS IN THE WEST BANK </p><p>AND GAZA. </p><p>FROM THE CURIA\'S PERSPECTIVE, THE SPIRAL OF VIOLENCE IN </p><p>ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AND THE RESULTANT EXODUS </p><p>OF THE REGION\'S CHRISTIANS, IS A MATTER OF PRIMARY CONCERN </p><p>AND A SUBJECT OF REPEATED PAPAL INTERVENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.   (SBU)  WE CAN CONTINUE TO COUNT ON THE HOLY SEE -- AND </p><p>THIS POPE IN PARTICULAR -- TO BE A VITAL PARTNER IN COMBATING </p><p>ANTI-SEMITISM IN EUROPE TODAY.  DESPITE OCCASIONAL </p><p>DIFFICULTIES AND LINGERING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH AND JUDAISM, WE CAN CONTINUE TO COUNT ON THE HOLY SEE </p><p>TO SPEAK OUT, TEACH, PROVIDE MORAL AND SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05545  03 OF 04  141511Z </p><p>AND KEEP PRESSURE ON EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS TO COUNTER SIGNS OF </p><p>RESURGENT ANTI-SEMITISM.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOLY SEE IS MORE </p><p>THAN WILLING TO USE BOTH ITS VOICE AND VOTE ON SUCH MORAL </p><p>ISSUES AS ANTI-SEMITISM AT EUROPEAN ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE </p><p>OSCE.  POST WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE HOLY SEE TO </p><p>HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR VIGILANCE AGAINST RESURGENT </p><p>ANTI-SEMITISM, NO MATTER WHAT ITS ORIGIN.  LAST WEEK, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THE AMBASSADOR BEGAN COORDINATING WITH HOLY SEE </p><p>COM\'S TO ENSURE THAT THE ANTI-SEMITISM THEME WILL BE PART OF </p><p>THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS\' ANNUAL GREETING TO THE POPE, WHICH </p><p>SHAPES THE POPE\'S ANNUAL DIPLOMATIC CORPS ADDRESS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE AMBASSADOR MEETS REGULARLY WITH ANTI-DEFAMATION </p><p>LEAGUE PRESIDENT ABRAHAM FOXMAN AND RELEVANT VATICAN </p><p>OFFICIALS TO KEEP THIS ISSUE IN THE FOREFRONT OF OUR AGENDA </p><p>AND TO HIGHLIGHT U.S. CONCERNS.  LATER THIS MONTH, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR WILL BE RECEIVING THE "NOSTRA AETATE" AWARD IN NEW </p><p>YORK FROM THE CENTER FOR JEWISH-CHRISTIAN RELATIONS AT SACRED </p><p>HEART UNIVERSITY, REFLECTING HIS COMMITMENT TO COMBATING </p><p>ANTI-SEMITISM.
