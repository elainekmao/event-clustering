<p>S E C R E T STATE 061624 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/04/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, QA, AF </p><p>SUBJECT: TALIBAN PROPOSAL FOR BIN LADEN ISLAMIC TRIBUNAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) TD-315/12389-01 (B) STATE 54430 </p><p>     (C) NEA A/S WALKER - QATAR FM HAMAD BIN JASSIM AL </p><p>         THANI TELCON 04/06/01 AT APPROX. 1400 EDT </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY NEA DAS ALLEN KEISWETTER, REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST FOR DOHA. PLEASE SEE </p><p>    PARA 3. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES THAT </p><p>DURING THE TALIBAN DELEGATION VISIT TO QATAR THE </p><p>TALIBAN AND QATARIS MAY DISCUSS A TRIBUNAL OF MUSLIM </p><p>SCHOLARS TO TRY USAMA BIN LADEN IN QATAR. REPORTEDLY, </p><p>UNDER THIS FORMULA, IF THE U.S. OFFERED SUFFICIENT </p><p>EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL, THEN UBL COULD CONCEIVABLY FACE A </p><p>SENTENCE BY THE ISLAMIC TRIBUNAL. IF THE TRIBUNAL DOES NOT </p><p>FIND HIM GUILTY, THEN UBL WOULD PRESUMABLY BE CONSIDERED </p><p>BY MANY TO BE EXONERATED. PER REFTELCON, QATARI FM HAMAD </p><p> </p><p>BIN JASSIM AL THANI (HBJ) TOLD NEA A/S WALKER ON APRIL 6 </p><p>THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY QATARI CONTACTS WITH THE </p><p>TALIBAN ON THE ISSUE OF A TRIAL FOR UBL. THE ONLY </p><p>CONTACTS OF WHICH HBJ WAS AWARE WAS THE CONTACT QATAR </p><p>MADE, IN ITS OIC ROLE, TO URGE THE TALIBAN NOT TO DESTROY </p><p>BUDDHIST ARTIFACTS AND STATUES. HBJ ADDED THE GOQ HAD NO </p><p>INTENTION TO PURSUE SUCH A TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) NOTWITHSTANDING HBJ\'S DENIAL OF ANY QATAR-TALIBAN </p><p>CONTACT ON THIS ISSUE, PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF THIS TRIBUNAL </p><p>OR ANY OTHER OPTION FOR TRYING UBL DURING THE TALIBAN HIGH </p><p>LEVEL VISIT WOULD ONLY SERVE TO CONFUSE THE ISSUE OF </p><p>TALIBAN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RESOLUTIONS. THE SPECIFIC </p><p>OPTION MENTIONED IN REF A IS ALSO UNACCEPTABLE TO THE U.S. </p><p>FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT IT WOULD </p><p>ATTEMPT TO FORCE THE U.S. TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AGAINST BIN </p><p>LADEN OUTSIDE OF U.S. JURISDICTION. IT IS ALSO UNCERTAIN </p><p>WHETHER THIS PROPOSAL WOULD MEET THE TERMS OF UN </p><p>RESOLUTIONS 1267 AND 1333.   AMBASSADOR MCKUNE IS </p><p>REQUESTED TO DELIVER THE FOLLOWING POINTS TO HBJ OR </p><p>ANOTHER QATARI GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AT A SUITABLE LEVEL: </p><p> </p><p>4. (SECRET/REL QATAR) </p><p>-- WE ARE HEARING RUMORS THAT THE TALIBAN MAY PROPOSE TO </p><p>HOLD A TRIAL FOR USAMA BIN LADEN IN A THIRD COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE UNDERSTAND THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCH APPROACH TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF QATAR, BUT WE WANT YOU TO BE AWARE OF OOUR </p><p>VIEWS. WITHOUT STUDYING THE DETAILS OF ANY SUCH PROPOSAL, </p><p>WE SERIOUSLY QUESTION WHETHER A THIRD COUNTRY TRIAL WOULD </p><p>MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAS LAID DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS YOU KNOW, BIN LADEN IS UNDER INDICTMENT IN THE US, </p><p>AND OUR POSITION IS THAT WE WANT HIM FOR TRIAL IN THE US. </p><p>IF THE TALEBAN HAVE A SERIOUS PROPOSAL, THEY SHOULD </p><p>PRESENT IT TO THE US. </p><p> </p><p>-- YOU MAY TELL THE TALIBAN THAT THE CONTENTS OF YOUR </p><p>CONVERSATIONS WILL BE SHARED WITH THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
