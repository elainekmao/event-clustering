Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on </p><p>7/18 entitled "Tough fight against narco trafficking". </p><p>"Undoubtedly, drug trafficking in Honduras is considerable, as </p><p>shown by the recent drug seizures that have evidenced the </p><p>determination of police authorities against this criminal </p><p>activity that is destroying the lives of millions of young people </p><p>around the world." </p><p> </p><p>"The seizure of more than 2 tons of drugs in the Bay Islands this </p><p>week was a hard hit against drug trafficking, and according to </p><p>the Minister of Security Oscar Alvarez, it demonstrates the </p><p>determination of the Honduran authorities to continue in the </p><p>fight against narco trafficking." </p><p> </p><p>"For that reason, we encourage the police, prosecutors and judges </p><p>to keep their upfront fight against narco traffickers, and don\'t </p><p>give in to their power and financial resources." </p><p> </p><p>2. Article in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" on </p><p>7/18 entitled "80 prominent people are being investigated for </p><p>drug trafficking".

Among </p><p>those being investigated, there are 80 renowned narcos that will </p><p>be brought to justice when our investigation is through\'." </p><p> </p><p>"About the seizure of 2,000 kilos of cocaine in Roatan after a </p><p>serious warning from the US Embassy, Medina noted, `I believe </p><p>it\'s just a coincidence, it isn\'t a direct response for what the </p><p>US Ambassador has recently said\'." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
