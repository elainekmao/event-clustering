<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003915 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2004 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: PENAL CODE AMENDMENTS INCLUDE HUMAN RIGHTS REFORMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1503 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: A revised version of the Turkish Penal Code </p><p>(TPC), currently under parliamentary review, includes </p><p>measures that would: expand the definition of torture and </p><p>increase prison sentences for those who commit torture; </p><p>strengthen privacy rights; introduce home detention for minor </p><p>crimes; and punish those who violate religious, political, </p><p>property, and free speech rights.  It would also punish those </p><p>who "ridicule" judicial decisions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Extensive Overhaul of Penal Code </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The GOT has prepared an extensive overhaul of the </p><p>592-article TPC.  Many of the amendments are technical and </p><p>minor, but some represent significant measures designed to </p><p>help bring Turkey into compliance with EU membership </p><p>criteria.  Parliament is engaged in a long process of </p><p>reviewing and approving each new article (see reftel for </p><p>previously adopted amendments). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Key Amendments </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Key elements of the new TPC include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Torture: Simple torture will be punished by 3-6 years </p><p>imprisonment, up from 3-5 years currently.  Civil servants </p><p>convicted of simple torture will be sentenced to 5-10 years </p><p>imprisonment.  Anyone convicted of causing death by torture </p><p>will be sentenced to life without parole, up from 20 years </p><p>currently.  Anyone convicted of causing permanent injury </p><p>through torture will face 12-18 years imprisonment.  In </p><p>addition, torture will be more broadly defined.  Under </p><p>current law, police "maltreatment" is not defined as torture </p><p>unless it occurs as part of a criminal investigation; under </p><p>the TPC revisions, police could be charged with torture for </p><p>beatings unrelated to an investigation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: The extended prison terms for civil servants and </p><p>expanded definition of torture are particularly important for </p><p>eroding the climate of impunity for police who commit </p><p>torture.  Currently, police can beat people on the street and </p><p>risk nothing more than a reprimand for "maltreatment."  The </p><p>new definition of torture is more in line with the standards </p><p>of the European Court of Human Rights, which has often ruled </p><p>against the GOT on torture cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Privacy Rights: Anyone convicted of: listening to or </p><p>recording private conversations; recording others\' remarks </p><p>without permission at community gatherings; or violating a </p><p>person\'s privacy using film or photographs faces fines or </p><p>prison terms ranging from 2 months to 6 years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: Until the mid-1990s there was virtually no legal </p><p>protection of privacy rights, and there were numerous </p><p>complaints of improper recording by government officials or </p><p>press.  These latest reforms are part of a series of legal </p><p>amendments in this field.  Members of organizations </p><p>representing Kurds, non-Muslims, and other groups out of the </p><p>mainstream often complain that their meetings and private </p><p>conversations are taped by the Government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Life Sentences: Language related to the death penalty, </p><p>now abolished in peacetime, will be removed.  The maximum </p><p>penalties will be "Heavy Life," meaning life without parole, </p><p>and "Regular Life," meaning possible release after 30 years </p><p>with good behavior. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Judicial Rulings: "Ridiculing" judicial decisions will </p><p>be defined as a crime, punishable by 1-3 years imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: Clearly a sour note in an otherwise positive set </p><p>of amendments -- not only restricting free speech but also </p><p>introducing a new crime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Crimes Against Humanity: Genocide and crimes against </p><p>humanity will be specifically defined as crimes punishable by </p><p>life without parole.  Founders or members of organizations </p><p>responsible for such crimes will be subject to 10-20 years </p><p>imprisonment and a life-long ban from public service.  It </p><p>will be possible to hold legal entities accountable for such </p><p>crimes.  The statute of limitations will not apply. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: MFA contacts have told us these amendments are </p><p>related to Turkey\'s eventual accession to the International </p><p>Criminal Court (ICC).  Turkey will have to join the ICC </p><p>before becoming a full EU member, and these are among a </p><p>series of legal amendments needed to harmonize Turkish law </p><p>with the ICC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Home Detention: For crimes punishable by prison terms </p><p>of two years or less, courts will have the option of </p><p>sentencing convicts to home imprisonment monitored by an </p><p>electronic device.  Courts will also have the option of </p><p>allowing a convict to work at a designated location during </p><p>his incarceration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Police Searches: Civil servants convicted of </p><p>conducting improper searches of persons will face 2-6 months </p><p>imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Property Rights: Anyone convicted of obstructing </p><p>someone from purchasing or selling property will face 6-12 </p><p>months imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Dissenting Views: Anyone convicted of obstructing the </p><p>lawful expression of dissenting views will face 1-5 years </p><p>imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Religious Freedom: Anyone convicted of obstructing </p><p>lawful religious expression will face 6-12 months </p><p>imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Political Rights: Anyone convicted of obstructing </p><p>lawful political expression will face 6 months-2 years </p><p>imprisonment, or 1-3 years for civil servants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The revised TPC reflects the efforts of a GOT </p><p>committed to make the reforms needed for EU accession. </p><p>However, as with other reforms, the effectiveness of these </p><p>measures will be determined by the qualify of implementation. </p><p> Some of these measures will be resisted by the judiciary and </p><p>security services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
