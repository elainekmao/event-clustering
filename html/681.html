<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 012970 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PGOV, KPAL, KISL, KWBGXF, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE PUBLIC FACE OF HAMAS IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) AMMAN 12819,  B) JERUSALEM 3647,  C) AMMAN </p><p>12624,  D) JERUSALEM 3626,  E) AMMAN 10029, AND </p><p>PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY HAMAS SPOKESMAN IN JORDAN IBRAHIM </p><p>GHAWSHAH REFRAINED FROM PRAISING THE OCTOBER 19 TEL </p><p>AVIV BOMBING BUT HAS PREDICTED THAT HAMAS WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE SUCH OPERATIONS.  DESPITE HIS </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO OBLIGE THE MEDIA WITH THE KIND OF </p><p>FLAMBOYANT RHETORIC THAT MAKES A GOOD STORY, </p><p>GHAWSHAH HAS CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED THAT HAMAS IN </p><p>JORDAN IS NOT LINKED TO HAMAS IN THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES EXCEPT IN THE MOST SUPERFICIAL WAYS. </p><p>PLO "POLITICAL COUNSELOR" OMAR SHAKAA SEPARATELY </p><p>REEMPHASIZED HIS BELIEF THAT WHILE THE MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD AND HAMAS IN JORDAN ARE ESSENTIALLY THE </p><p>SAME ORGANIZATION, THEY DO NOT CALL THE SHOTS IN THE </p><p>TERRITORIES.  OTHER REJECTIONIST GROUPS IN JORDAN </p><p>HAVE REAFFIRMED THEIR SUPPORT OF JIHAD AS A METHOD </p><p>OF RETAKING PALESTINE AND HAVE CALLED ON JORDANIANS </p><p>AS WELL AS PALESTINIANS TO RESIST THE PEACE TREATY </p><p>WITH ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN THE ABSENCE OF FIRM EVIDENCE OF A LINK </p><p>BETWEEN GHAWSHAH AND HAMAS\' MILITARY WING, THE </p><p>JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT SEEMS PREPARED TO TOLERATE </p><p>RHETORIC THAT DOES NOT EXCEED THAT OF OTHER </p><p>REJECTIONISTS HERE.  ARAFAT\'S RECENT ALLEGATIONS </p><p>THAT HAMAS IN JORDAN IS SUPPORTING AND IN SOME CASES </p><p>DIRECTING EVENTS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES ARE </p><p>FLIMSY AND IGNORE THE FACT THAT KING HUSSEIN STANDS </p><p>TO LOSE AS MUCH, IF NOT MORE, THAN ARAFAT IF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY IS OVERWHELMED BY ISLAMIC </p><p>RADICALS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>HAMAS IN JORDAN RESPONDS TO RECENT ATTACKS... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) HAMAS SPOKESMAN IN JORDAN IBRAHIM GHAWSHAH </p><p>HAS NOT PRAISED THE OCTOBER 19 BOMBING IN TEL AVIV, </p><p>BUT HE HAS DEFENDED RECENT HAMAS ATTACKS BY </p><p>ASSERTING THAT RESISTANCE OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE </p><p>AGAINST THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION.  GHAWSHAH MADE THE </p><p>FOLLOWING POINTS TO THE LATEST EDITION OF ENGLISH- </p><p>LANGUAGE WEEKLY "THE STAR" (FULL TEXT IN FBIS AMMAN </p><p>JN2310100694) AND REITERATED THEM IN STATEMENTS TO </p><p>OTHER MEDIA, INCLUDING CNN: </p><p> </p><p>--   "THE OBJECTIVE OF THE WEST JERUSALEM SHOOTING </p><p>     LAST WEEK WAS TO SHOW THAT PALESTINIAN </p><p>     OPPOSITION TO THE PEACE PROCESS IS ALIVE AND </p><p>     KICKING." </p><p> </p><p>--   "THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS OPERATION (THE WEST </p><p>     JERUSALEM SHOOTING) WAS THAT IT TOOK PLACE IN </p><p>     THE HEART OF THE SO-CALLED ISRAELI ENTITY IN </p><p>     WEST JERUSALEM, NOT IN EAST JERUSALEM. </p><p>     ISLAMISTS ARE NOT ONLY DEMANDING THE RETURN OF </p><p>     EAST JERUSALEM BUT ALSO WEST JERUSALEM." </p><p> </p><p>--   "THIS OPERATION PROVED THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF </p><p>     COMPETITION BETWEEN JORDAN AND THE PLO OVER THE </p><p>     HOLY PLACES IN JERUSALEM.  THE CAUSE IS NOT WHO </p><p>     CONTROLS THE HOLY PLACES, BUT HOW TO REDEEM THE </p><p>     CITY OF JERUSALEM, THE CAPITAL OF PALESTINE." </p><p> </p><p>--   "THE KIDNAPPING OF ISRAELI CORPORAL WACHSMAN </p><p>     WAS A POLITICAL ACT HAMAS WANTED TO BRING TO </p><p>     THE FOREFRONT THE ISSUE OF 5000 PALESTINIAN </p><p>     DETAINEES STILL HELD IN ISRAELI JAILS." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>...AND TO ARAFAT\'S EFFORTS TO RESTRICT THE GROUP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) GHAWSHAH ALSO HARSHLY CRITICIZED ARAFAT IN </p><p>THE "STAR" INTERVIEW FOR ATTEMPTING TO CRACK DOWN ON </p><p>HAMAS IN GAZ: </p><p> </p><p>--   "MR. ARAFAT DOES NOT WANT THE RELEASE OF THE </p><p>     PRISONERS BECAUSE 3,000 OF THOSE DETAINED ARE </p><p>     HAMAS SUPPORTERS." </p><p> </p><p>--   "ARAFAT HAS CROSSED THE RED LINES BY </p><p>     SANCTIONING SWEEPING DETENTIONS, COLLECTIONS OF </p><p>     WEAPONS, THE PERSECUTION OF HAMAS ACTIVISTS AND </p><p>     THE CLOSURE OF THE ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY." </p><p> </p><p>--   "ARAFAT MUST NOW FACE HIS PEOPLE, WHICH IS WHAT </p><p>     PERES AND RABIN WANTED ALL ALONG: AN INTRA- </p><p>     PALESTINIAN STRUGGLE." </p><p> </p><p>--   "THE PEOPLE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT ARAFAT IS </p><p>     ACTING AS A COLLABORATOR FOR ISRAEL.  THE </p><p>     PEOPLE\'S ANGER INCREASED EVEN MORE WHEN THEY </p><p>     DISCOVERED THERE WAS COLLUSION BETWEEN </p><p>     PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) INTELLIGENCE AND ITS </p><p>     ISRAELI COUNTERPARTS DURING THE DIR NABALA (THE </p><p>     KIDNAPPING OF CORPORAL NASHON WACHSMAN) </p><p>     OPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>GHAWSHAH\'S POSITION AS SPOKESMAN </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DESPITE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS </p><p>PLACED ON GHAWSHAH AND HIS COLLEAGUE MUHAMMAD AL- </p><p>NAZZAL LAST APRIL, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA </p><p>CONTINUE TO SEEK OUT GHAWSHAH AS AN ACCESSIBLE </p><p>SPOKESMAN OF THE HAMAS MOVEMENT AND BECAUSE OF HIS </p><p>DEMONSTRATED WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE SENSATIONAL </p><p>COMMENTARY AND REACTION TO EVENTS IN THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES.  NEVERTHELESS, JOURNALISTIC SOURCES </p><p>REPORT THAT GHAWSHAH CONSISTENTLY DENIES THAT HAMAS </p><p>IN JORDAN HAS ANY CONTROL OVER OR DIRECT CONNECTION </p><p>TO EVENTS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, THOUGH THESE </p><p>DISCLAIMERS RARELY APPEAR IN PRINT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ON THE DAY OF THE TEL AVIV BOMBING, GHAWSHAH </p><p>WAS BESIEGED BY REPORTERS LOOKING FOR STATEMENTS. </p><p>SOURCES STRESSED THAT GHAWSHAH FIRMLY REFUSED TO </p><p>ISSUE A WRITTEN STATEMENT ON THIS OCCASION AND STUCK </p><p>TO HIS USUAL PRACTICE OF COMMENTING VERBALLY.  THEY </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT IN THE RARE INSTANCES HE DOES </p><p>COMMIT A STATEMENT TO PAPER, HE PREFERS TO RELEASE </p><p>THEM IN LEBANON OR SYRIA.  (COMMENT: EMBASSY HAS </p><p>NOTED OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS THAT FORMAL HAMAS </p><p>COMMUNIQUES RARELY ORIGINATE IN AMMAN.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THIS DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE HAMAS STATEMENT FAXED TO </p><p>THE "JORDAN TIMES" THAT WAS CITED IN REF D.  THE </p><p>"TIMES" ARTICLE NOTED THAT THE STATEMENT HAS "NO </p><p>DATELINE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>VIEW FROM THE PLO IN JORDAN </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) PLO "POLITICAL COUNSELOR" IN AMMAN OMAR </p><p>SHAKAA ON OCTOBER 19 RESTATED TO POLOFF HIS BELIEF </p><p>THAT HAMAS IN JORDAN EXISTS AS A WING OF THE </p><p>JORDANIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  HE ASSERTED THAT </p><p>NEITHER HAMAS NOR THE BROTHERHOOD HERE EXERT ANY </p><p>CONTROL OVER HAMAS IN THE TERRITORIES.  HAMAS ALSO </p><p>DOES NOT RECEIVE TRAINING OR MATERIAL FROM JORDAN. </p><p>JORDAN\'S HAMAS MOVEMENT THUS PRIMARILY MAKES RADICAL </p><p>STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONS PLANNED AND </p><p>CARRIED OUT BY HAMAS IN THE TERRITORIES WITHOUT </p><p>REFERENCE TO THE OFFICE HERE, SHAKAA DECLARED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) AS HE HAS BEFORE, SHAKAA MADE IT CLEAR THAT </p><p>HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT KING HUSSEIN OR ANY ELEMENT </p><p>OF THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT IS INVOLVED IN </p><p>SUPPORTING HAMAS OPERATIONS IN THE TERRITORIES. </p><p>SHAKAA BELIEVES THAT THE KING AND THE GOJ HAVE A </p><p>TACIT AGREEMENT WITH THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD THAT </p><p>ALLOWS HAMAS TO OPERATE HERE UNDER THE BROTHERHOOD\'S </p><p>UMBRELLA IN EXCHANGE FOR ASSURANCES THAT THE GROUP </p><p>WILL NOT SUPPORT OR UNDERTAKE VIOLENCE IN JORDAN. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ALTHOUGH GHAWSHAH\'S WORDS TAKE ON ADDED </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE HE ACTS AS HAMAS\' "OFFICIAL </p><p>SPOKESMAN," THE SENTIMENTS HE EXPRESSES ARE SIMILAR </p><p>TO THOSE OF OTHER REJECTIONIST GROUPS IN JORDAN </p><p>WHICH HAVE ATTACKED THE JORDANIAN-ISRAELI ACCORD AND </p><p>LENT VERBAL SUPPORT TO ATTACKS IN THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES BY HAMAS\' MILITARY WING.  THE PRACTICAL </p><p>EFFECT OF THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT\'S HANDLING OF </p><p>GHAWSHAH, IN THE ABSENCE OF COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF A </p><p>MORE DIRECT CONNECTION TO HAMAS\' MILITARY CELLS, IS </p><p>TO TOLERATE GHAWSHAH\'S STATEMENTS AS LONG AS THEY DO </p><p>NOT EXCEED STANDARD REJECTIONIST RHETORIC. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) ALLEGATIONS THAT THE KING AND JORDANIAN </p><p>SECURITY SERVICES HAVE HAD A ROLE IN THESE ATTACKS </p><p>ARE EVENLESS CREDIBLE AND WERE DEALT WITH IN REF C. </p><p>THE SUGGESTION THAT THE KING WOULD PLAY A DANGEROUS </p><p>GAME WITH HAMAS TO EMBARRASS ARAFAT AND DESTABILIZE </p><p>THE PA IGNORES THE FACT THAT THE KING HAS JUST AS </p><p>UC TO LOSE AS ARAFAT IF HAMAS BRINGS DOWN THE PA. </p><p>BOMBINGS AND ARRESTS INSIDE JORDAN THIS YEAR (SEE </p><p>REF E AND PREVIOUS REPORTING ON THE "ARAB AFGHANS") </p><p>BROUGHT HOME THE POINT THAT JORDAN HAS ITS OWN </p><p>RADICAL ISLAMIST UNDERGROUND, PART OF WHICH MANY </p><p>THINK IS A CLANDESTINE EXTENSION OF HAMAS. </p><p> </p><p>EGAN </p><p></p></div>
