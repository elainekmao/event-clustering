<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003154 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: FORMER MP DISCUSSES ROLE IN MANISA TORTURE </p><p>CONVICTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2246 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Sabri Ergul, one of the prosecuting attorneys </p><p>in the high-profile Manisa police torture case, used his </p><p>status as a parliamentarian to maintain pressure on the GOT </p><p>and ensure the 10 defendants were convicted and sentenced. </p><p>Ergul served as a witness in the case, having seen some of </p><p>the teenage victims while they were being tortured in </p><p>detention.  After the conviction, he hung a banner calling on </p><p>PM Erdogan to see that the officers were arrested and jailed. </p><p> In addition to such efforts, Ergul credits a fact-based </p><p>prosecuting strategy and international pressure for the </p><p>conviction.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Manisa trial ended April 4 (reftel) after seven </p><p>and a half years when an appeals court upheld the conviction </p><p>of all 10 police defendants, who were sentenced to prison </p><p>terms ranging from five to 11 years.  After the trial, we </p><p>requested an appointment with Ergul, one of the prosecuting </p><p>attorneys and a former Republican Peoples\' Party (CHP) MP. </p><p>Ergul gave us a detailed account of his involvement in the </p><p>case.  His story is consistent with what we know about these </p><p>events, and we consider it highly credible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>By Chance, Ergul Involved From Day One </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ergul recalled that in December 1995 a woman who had </p><p>worked on his parliamentary campaign called him, upset that </p><p>her younger brother was among 16 teenagers detained and taken </p><p>to the Manisa police detention center.  At her request he </p><p>went to see the teenagers.  As a lawyer, he said, he had no </p><p>clear right at that time to see the detainees, though the GOT </p><p>had issued a circular recommending lawyers be given access </p><p>(Note: Lawyers have the right to immediate access today under </p><p>recent reforms.  End Note).  But as an MP, he was not going </p><p>to take no for an answer.  He demanded access, and was sent </p><p>back and forth between the prosecutor\'s and police chief\'s </p><p>offices.  Eventually, Ergul said, he convinced the prosecutor </p><p>to call the police chief as Ergul stood by.  When he arrived </p><p>at the detention center, the police chief sent him upstairs </p><p>to see the director of the Anti-Terror Department, where the </p><p>teenagers were being held.  But when he got there, the </p><p>director and his assistants had gone, apparently assuming he </p><p>would eventually give up and leave as well.  However, Ergul </p><p>convinced the guard on duty to let him wait in the director\'s </p><p>office for his return. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) From the office, Ergul could hear screams partly </p><p>muffled by loud music.  He followed the sound to a door, </p><p>which he opened and saw a young girl on the floor, naked </p><p>except for a blanket held against her body.  There was </p><p>another teenager on the floor and two more sitting on chairs. </p><p> An officer in the cell tried to shove the door closed, and </p><p>Ergul angrily shoved back.  During the confrontation, the </p><p>guard, pointedly referring to Ergul as "Mr. Parliamentarian," </p><p>said the director was available to meet him.  At that point, </p><p>Ergul said, he decided he would use his skills as a lawyer </p><p>and status as an MP to prosecute the case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Doctors Confirm Torture Claims </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ergul arranged for a group of doctors expert at </p><p>identifying signs of torture to examine the detainees, most </p><p>of whom were age 14-16.  The doctors found physical evidence </p><p>to support the teenagers\' accounts of being beaten, given </p><p>electric shocks, and raped with truncheons.  Interviewed </p><p>separately, the teenagers told similar stories of torture. </p><p>For example, several said police gave them electric shocks </p><p>through a ring on the right toe; doctors said a ring on the </p><p>left toe could damage the heart.  Many recounted that police </p><p>administered shocks to the hairy parts of the body and threw </p><p>water on them during the torture -- techniques the doctors </p><p>said were commonly used to avoid telltale marks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Maintaining the Pressure </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>6. (C) Ergul said he knew he would have to maintain </p><p>consistent pressure in order to ensure the police were </p><p>convicted and sentenced.  At the start of the trial he sent a </p><p>case file to then PM Ciller, and when he got no response he </p><p>hung a copy on the door of the PM\'s office.  Inspired by </p><p>traditional signs on businesses with messages like "In This </p><p>Establishment There is Bread," Ergul hung a sign on the </p><p>Manisa detention center declaring, "In This Establishment </p><p>There is Torture."  After the April 4 conviction, Ergul </p><p>continued to follow through to ensure that the GOT fulfilled </p><p>its duty to round up the convicts and incarcerate them.  On </p><p>the morning after the verdict, he hung a banner on his </p><p>balcony with a message for his neighbor, PM Erdogan: "The </p><p>Court Did Its Job, Now It\'s Your Turn."  Pictures of Ergul </p><p>standing by the banner appeared in newspapers.  When Ergul </p><p>learned that several of the convicted officers were staying </p><p>in a police guest house in Ankara, he threatened to send the </p><p>media over unless they surrendered, which they did.  He also </p><p>contacted the Embassy to make sure none of the convicts could </p><p>be given visas.  To date, nine of the 10 officers have turned </p><p>themselves in; there is an arrest warrant for the tenth, </p><p>Engin Erdogan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Teenagers Acquitted on Terror Charges </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) As for the teenagers, they were arrested and charged </p><p>with being members of the Marxist-Leninist Revolutionary </p><p>People\'s Party (DHKP/C), a terrorist organization.  Ergul </p><p>said they were accused of writing pro-DHKP/C graffiti, </p><p>although their graffiti involved nothing more threatening </p><p>than statements like, "Down with University Tuition," a </p><p>protest against a recent decision to begin charging tuition </p><p>at public universities.  Later, he said, prosecutors tried to </p><p>trump up the charges by blaming them for a barbershop fire. </p><p>But that strategy fell through when an investigation revealed </p><p>a faulty stove as the cause of the blaze.  The teenagers were </p><p>all acquitted in court, despite having confessed under </p><p>torture, but remained in detention during their trials for </p><p>periods ranging from seven months to 2.5 years.  Ergul said </p><p>he tried to get the cases against the teenagers dropped in </p><p>light of the evidence of torture, but his efforts were </p><p>rejected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Fact Based Prosecution, International Interest </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ergul said he and other prosecuting attorneys were </p><p>careful to avoid politicizing the case.  In public </p><p>statements, and in court, they focused on the evidence at </p><p>hand and did not try to depict the torture suffered by the </p><p>teenagers as part of a broader human rights crisis.  Ergul </p><p>believes that strategy helped maintain public support, and </p><p>pressure, for a conviction.  He also said U.S. and European </p><p>pressure on the GOT helped ensure a conviction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Manisa case has been around for so long that </p><p>attention shifted years ago from the suffering of the victims </p><p>to the prosecution of the criminals.  Ergul\'s account reminds </p><p>us why cases like these are so important, and underscores the </p><p>need for Turks and outside observers to insist that Turkish </p><p>authorities punish torturers. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
