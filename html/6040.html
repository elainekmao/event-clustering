(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE -- PLEASE SEE </p><p>PARAGRAPH FOUR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The Dubai Ports and Customs Authority </p><p>(DPA), which oversees Jebel Ali and Port Rashid </p><p>(together the 12th largest port in the world), has </p><p>on several occasions indicated to us that they are </p><p>eager to move ahead now with Export Control </p><p>initiatives.  The UAE federal authorities </p><p>(Ministry of Foreign Affairs) have told us that </p><p>they are supportive of the USG providing </p><p>appropriate training directly to DPA.  While some </p><p>aspects of our bilateral EXBS roadmap -- such as a </p><p>workshop on legislation -- must necessarily wait </p><p>until the UAE federal government clarifies </p><p>responsibilities and authorities (a matter </p><p>currently pending before the Cabinet, see reftel), </p><p>we nonetheless can and should move forward with </p><p>other training that we can provide directly to </p><p>DPA.  Among the items we can work directly with </p><p>DPA are: </p><p> </p><p>-- US Customs\' Container Security Initiative; </p><p> </p><p>-- training on detection/identification of </p><p>controlled substances; and, </p><p> </p><p>-- review/assessment of DPA procedures from an </p><p>export controls perspective.  (Note:  An </p><p>assessment might usefully include manifest data </p><p>collection and management, a review of existing </p><p>export control lists, and an assessment of the </p><p>port/customs interface and port operations more </p><p>generally -- particularly with regard to </p><p>transshipment. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Action request:  Post requests </p><p>Washington addressees coordinate in developing a </p><p>program of EXBS activities we may present to DPA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  This message coordinated with Amconsul </p><p>Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
