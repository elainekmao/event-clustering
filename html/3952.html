<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005915 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, PGOV, US, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PM ABUL RAGHEB TELLS DAS CHENEY GOJ TO CONTINUE </p><p>ECONOMIC, CIVIL SERVICE REFORM EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  NEA DAS Elizabeth Cheney discussed the USAID </p><p>program and economic reform October 8 with Prime Minister Ali </p><p>Abul Ragheb and Planning Minister Bassam Awadallah </p><p>(discussion of honor killings reported in septel). </p><p>Ambassador Gnehm, USAID Director Christiansen-Wagner and </p><p>PolCouns Silliman accompanied.  DAS Cheney praised Jordan\'s </p><p>economic reform program and noted that Jordan has the </p><p>potential to be "a model of reform and development for the </p><p>region."  She previewed the Middle East Partnership </p><p>Initiative (MEPI) which Secretary Powell will roll out in a </p><p>speech on November 6.  MEPI will "demonstrate U.S. commitment </p><p>and dedication" to key areas of development in the Middle </p><p>East, including economic development, education, political </p><p>reform, rule of law, and development of civil society.  All </p><p>of these areas, she noted, were highlighted in the recently </p><p>released UN Arab Human Development Report.  She explained </p><p>that this initiative will encompass all of the U.S.\'s </p><p>existing assistance programs in the Arab world which total </p><p>over USD 1 billion annually.  In addition, the USG will </p><p>dedicate USD 20 million for pilot projects in FY02 and </p><p>anticipates additional funding in following years. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Abul Ragheb expressed Jordan\'s great appreciation </p><p>for continued USG support, especially through the USAID </p><p>program.  He noted that the GOJ is now focusing its social </p><p>development activities in areas that the poorest Jordanians </p><p>can feel most:  education, health, vocational training, </p><p>water, and youth programs.  "We need the people to feel what </p><p>is going on."  He described GOJ relations with the IMF and </p><p>World Bank as excellent, and thanked the U.S. for its efforts </p><p>earlier in the year to secure a new Paris Club agreement for </p><p>Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>PRIVATIZATION, ITC UPDATE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Abul Ragheb said that the privatization process is </p><p>going well.  Jordan TeleCom will conduct its first IPO in the </p><p>coming week, selling an additional 15 percent of its shares </p><p>(France TeleCom currently owns 40 percent and Jordanian </p><p>pension systems an additional 10 percent, he noted.) </p><p>Planning Minister Awadallah commented that he hoped the GOJ </p><p>would be "completely outside of JTC" and not dependent on its </p><p>revenues by 2004 "so the Finance Ministry won\'t defend JTC\'s </p><p>monopoly so much."  He said Jordan hopes to find a way to </p><p>fund a USD 53 million project to install the hardware to </p><p>provide a broadband link among all Jordanian schools.  This </p><p>would enhance both Jordanian education and market access. </p><p>The GOJ also has plans to turn school IT facilities into </p><p>after-hours community IT centers. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Abul Ragheb said that, in the process of </p><p>privatization, it is important that the GOJ "deal fairly" </p><p>with those employees who might lose their jobs.  Jordan needs </p><p>more and better programs to retrain workers for jobs in the </p><p>private sector.  This will be especially important, he said, </p><p>when the overstaffed phosphates company is privatized. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>PENSION REFORM </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Responding to a question on civil service and </p><p>pension reform, Abul Ragheb said the GOJ\'s ultimate goal is </p><p>to reduce the number of public sector employees.  Jordan has </p><p>been working with international donors and the IMF on civil </p><p>service and pension reform, and has succeeded in getting all </p><p>newly-hired government employees into the centralized system. </p><p> The problem remains the "different style of pension" systems </p><p>for the military and security services.  Eventually, the GOJ </p><p>wants to move these systems under the umbrella of the central </p><p>pension system, but there are important political factors to </p><p>take into account.  In the short term, however, the GOJ is </p><p>examining ways to reduce military pension expenditures, for </p><p>example by raising the minimum service time to qualify for a </p><p>pension from 16 years to 18 or 20, and by increasing GOJ </p><p>programs to help retired military to find private sector </p><p>jobs.  On e-government, Abul Ragheb said the GOJ is in the </p><p>process of amending civil service bylaws to increase the </p><p>service orientation of government employees.  Awadallah noted </p><p>that Jordan had just received a USD 120 million loan from the </p><p>IMF as the second phase in a public sector reform program. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  DAS Cheney has cleared this message. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
