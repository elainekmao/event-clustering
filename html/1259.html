(C)  AT THE DEPARTMENT\'S INSTRUCTION, AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPRESSED STRONG U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT THE FARM OCCUPATIONS </p><p>AND CONTINUING RURAL VIOLENCE TO VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA ON </p><p>AUGUST 25.  MSIKA BLAMED COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MDC FOR INCITING MUCH OF THE PRE-ELECTION </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INSISTED THAT, IN OCCUPYING FARMS, MOST WAR </p><p>VETERANS HAD MERELY ENGAGED IN TRESPASSING, WHICH WAS NOT </p><p>A SERIOUS CRIME.  THE CABINET HAD AGREED THAT NO NEW FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS WOULD BE PERMITTED, AND THAT WAR VETERANS </p><p>SHOULD BE MOVED TO FARMS IDENTIFIED FOR COMPULSORY </p><p>ACQUISITION.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE WAS NOT IN AGREEMENT THAT VETERANS SHOULD BE </p><p>REMOVED FROM CURRENTLY-OCCUPIED FARMS ON AN EXPEDITED </p><p>BASIS.   MSIKA SAID ZIMBABWE BORE ONLY SOME OF THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND SAID THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S MILLENIUM ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN OUGHT TO </p><p>GET THE ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK.

END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>U.S. CONCERNS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY USAID DIRECTOR AND </p><p>POLOFF, CALLED ON VICE-PRESIDENT MSIKA AUGUST 25 TO </p><p>DELIVER REF B DEMARCHE ON CONTINUING VIOLENCE AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, AS PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE WAS UNAVAILABLE.  AFTER PROVIDING MSIKA WITH A </p><p>NON-PAPER CONTAINING REFTEL TALKING POINTS, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR UNDERSCORED CONTINUING U.S. CONCERN OVER </p><p>VIOLENCE AND FARM OCCUPATIONS, WHICH HAD DAMAGED </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S STANDING IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED THE EVICTIONS OF WAR VETERANS FROM SEVERAL </p><p>FARMS EARLIER IN THE WEEK (REF A) AS A POSITIVE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, BUT NOTED THAT VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION </p><p>WERE CONTINUING IN MANY AREAS.  THE UNITED STATES </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>WANTED TO BE HELPFUL, BUT COULD NOT UNDER THESE </p><p>CONDITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE, MSIKA CLAIMED, WAS NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04750  01 OF 03  251458Z </p><p>MOSTLY OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S MAKING.  HE LAID MUCH OF THE </p><p>BLAME ON COMMERCIAL FARMERS, WHOM HE SAID HAD RENEGED ON </p><p>THEIR COMMITMENTS AT THE SEPTEMBER 1998 DONORS CONFERENCE </p><p>ON LAND REFORM, AND SUBSEQUENTLY FORMED MILITIAS TO BLOCK </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESETTLEMENT EFFORT.  HE ALSO BLAMED THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), WHICH HE </p><p>SAID WAS LAUNCHED NOT FROM ZIMBABWE BUT BY "OUTSIDE </p><p>FORCES." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE VICE PRESIDENT INSISTED THAT THE FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS HAD BEEN MOTIVATED NOT </p><p>BY POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS BUT BY GENUINE ANGER AGAINST </p><p>FARMERS AND THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE SLOW PACE OF </p><p>RESETTLEMENT. (NB. IN PRIOR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR, MSIKA ACKNOWLEDGED THAT POLITICS HAD PLAYED A </p><p>ROLE IN THE OCCUPATIONS.  END NOTE)  THE DONORS\' </p><p>SUSPENSION OF ASSISTANCE IN LIGHT OF THE OCCUPATIONS, </p><p>MSIKA CLAIMED, EMBOLDENED THE FARMERS TO "ENGINEER" </p><p>VIOLENT CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE WAR VETERANS, EVEN THOUGH </p><p>THE VETERANS HAD BEEN TOLD TO BE PEACEFUL AND NOT TO </p><p>INTERFERE WITH FARMING OPERATIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT WOULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN IRRESPONSIBLE IN ORDERING THE POLICE TO EVICT </p><p>THE LARGE NUMBERS OF WAR VETERANS, AS THIS WOULD HAVE </p><p>RESULTED IN WIDESPREAD BLOODSHED.  IN ANY CASE, MSIKA </p><p>SAID, MOST OF THE WAR VETERANS WERE MERELY TRESPASSING, </p><p>WHICH IN HIS VIEW WAS NOT A SERIOUS CRIME. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7271 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04750  02 OF 03  251458Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------7E161D  251459Z /38 </p><p>P 251457Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6939 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 004750 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER, GRACE SONE, AND HOFFMAN BARAK </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04750  02 OF 03  251458Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/17/05 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, EFIN, EAGR, PINR, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: VP MSIKA: BLAMES OTHERS FOR VIOLENCE AND </p><p>ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, BUT SOME ENCOURAGING WORDS ON LAND </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MSIKA INSISTED THAT HE DOES NOT CONDONE </p><p>LAWLESSNESS AND CRITICIZED THOSE WAR VETERANS WHO HAD </p><p>INTERFERED WITH FARMING OPERATIONS OR BUILT STRUCTURES ON </p><p>FARMS THEY HAD OCCUPIED.  MSIKA SAID HE HAD ARGUED IN </p><p>CABINET THAT THE VETERANS MUST BE MOVED AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE TO FARMS IDENTIFIED FOR ACQUISITION, AS THE </p><p>LONGER THIS PROCESS DRAGS ON, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WILL </p><p>BE TO MOVE THEM.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE DID NOT SHARE THE CABINET\'S VIEW. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE DISAGREED WITH MSIKA\'S </p><p>CLAIM THAT THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS HAD ENGINEERED THE </p><p>VIOLENCE.  ON THE CONTRARY, THE EVIDENCE CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF BORE THE REPONSIBILITY FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF </p><p>PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE.  MSIKA DISAGREED, SAYING THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF ONLY HAD RESPONDED TO PROVOCATIONS.  TALK OF </p><p>FARMER MILITIAS IS NONSENSE.  BOTH HE AND MSIKA KNEW, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SAID, THAT MANY OF THE SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS </p><p>WERE TOO YOUNG TO HAVE FOUGHT IN THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE, </p><p>AND CLEARLY HAD BEEN SENT TO THE FARMS TO INTIMIDATE AND </p><p>BEAT THE FARMERS AND THEIR WORKERS.  IF PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>HAD MADE IT CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING THAT VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION WERE UNACCEPTABLE AND POLICE HAD BEEN </p><p>ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB, MOST OF THE LAWLESSNESS COULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04750  02 OF 03  251458Z </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MSIKA CLAIMED THAT ZIMBABWE DID NOT BEAR FULL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  THE GOZ </p><p>PERHAPS WAS TO BLAME FOR SPENDING MORE THAN IT SHOULD </p><p>HAVE ON RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND ON ITS MILITARY INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN THE DROC, WHICH HE HOPED WOULD END SOON.  HOWEVER, HE </p><p>CRITICIZED THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR ADVOCATING THE </p><p>IMPOSITION OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST ZIMBABWE, AND FORMER </p><p>AF ASSISTANT SECRETARY CHESTER CROCKER FOR DOING THE SAME </p><p>THING IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT </p><p>CROCKER WAS A PRIVATE CITIZEN REFLECTING HIS OWN VIEWS </p><p>AND DID NOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. </p><p>HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE USG WAS NOT SEEKING TO PUNISH THE </p><p>GOZ, BUT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS HERE. </p><p>MSIKA ASKED ABOUT THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT (ZDA), WHICH </p><p>HE SAID WOULD PUSH ZIMBABWE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT THE EMBASSY SHARES THE CONCERNS </p><p>OF THE U.S. CONGRESS ABOUT FARM OCCUPATIONS AND THE </p><p>ACCOMPANYING VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>WAY FORWARD </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ASKED ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S NEXT STEPS, THE VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT REPLIED THAT THE GOZ\'S MILLENIUM ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY PLAN SHOULD GET THE ECONOMY BACK ON THE RIGHT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04750  02 OF 03  251458Z </p><p>TRACK.  THE GOZ HAD DEVALUED THE CURRENCY (FROM 38 TO </p><p>50:1) AND WAS PLANNING TO REDUCE DRASTICALLY THE SIZE OF </p><p>THE CIVIL SERVICE (NB: MSIKA\'S AIDE TOLD POLOFF IN AN </p><p>ASIDE THAT SOME 20,000 CIVIL SERVICE JOBS COULD BE </p><p>ELIMINATED. END NOTE).  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>PLANNED TO REDUCE EXPENDITURES, BUT LIKELY WOULD NOT MEET </p><p>ITS INITIAL TARGET OF A 6 BILLION (ZIMBABWE DOLLAR) </p><p>REDUCTION.  MSIKA NOTED THAT AN IMF TEAM HAD JUST ARRIVED </p><p>IN HARARE, AND HE HOPED ITS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD BE CONSTRUCTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ON LAND, THE GOZ\'S ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE WAS TO </p><p>ENSURE A DISTRIBUTION OF EIGHT MILLION HECTARES OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S ARABLE LAND TO BLACK FARMERS, WITH WHITE FARMS </p><p>RETAINING THE REMAINING FOUR MILLION.  INDIGENOUS FARMERS </p><p>CURRENTLY CONTROL THREE MILLION HECTARES.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WOULD ABIDE BY ITS COMMITMENT TO ACQUIRE ONLY </p><p>UNPRODUCTIVE FARMS OR THOSE OWNED BY ABSENTEE </p><p>PROPRIETORS.  FARMS ENGAGED IN AGRO-INDUSTRY WOULD BE </p><p>EXEMPTED FROM THE RESETTLEMENT EFFORT.  IN THE SHORT- </p><p>TERM, NO NEW FARM OCCUPATIONS WOULD BE PERMITTED, WHILE </p><p>WAR VETERANS CURRENTLY OCCUPYING COMMERCIAL FARMS WOULD </p><p>BE REMOVED AND TAKEN TO LAND IDENTIFIED FOR COMPULSORY </p><p>ACQUISITION.  HE IMPLIED THAT THE HEAVY-HANDED TACTICS </p><p>EMPLOYED BY POLICE DURING THE EVICTIONS OF SOME WAR </p><p>VETERANS HAD COMPLICATED THE GOVERNMENT\'S TASK.

THE DONORS ARE WILLING TO BE INVOLVED, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR REPLIED, BUT EMPHASIZED THAT THE VIOLENCE MUST </p><p>END, RULE OF LAW MUST BE RESTORED, AND COURT ORDERS </p><p>RELATED TO THE ILLEGAL INVASIONS MUST BE ENFORCED. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, THE PROCESS MUST BE FAIR AND TRANSPARENT, </p><p>AND FARMOWNERS MUST BE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR LAND. </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S LAND POLICY IS NOT A "NORMAL" ONE, MSIKA SAID, </p><p>RECALLING THAT THE LIBERATION WAR HAD BEEN FOUGHT </p><p>PRIMARILY OVER THE CONCENTRATION OF LAND IN THE HANDS OF </p><p>A FEW. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) THE USAID DIRECTOR NOTED THAT DONORS HAVE </p><p>DISCUSSED INFORMALLY HOW THEY MIGHT REENGAGE ON LAND </p><p>REFORM, AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS.

(C) MSIKA\'S COMMENTS LAYING THE PREDOMINANT BLAME ON </p><p>OTHERS FOR ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC MESS AND THE PRE-ELECTION </p><p>VIOLENCE WERE MERELY THE LATEST IN A COMMON REFRAIN FROM </p><p>THIS GOVERNMENT.  THESE ARE ALL FROM THE SAME SCRIPT.  ON </p><p>LAND, WE WERE ENCOURAGED BY MSIKA\'S REPORT OF CABINET </p><p>AGREEMENT THAT NO NEW INVASIONS WILL BE PERMITTED AND </p><p>THAT WAR VETERANS SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM CURRENTLY- </p><p>OCCUPIED FARMS, EXCEPT FROM THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN LISTED. </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE IS CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH REMOVING </p><p>THE VETERANS, HOWEVER, AND HIS DISCOMFORT LIKELY WAS NOT </p><p>ASSUAGED BY THE AGGRESSIVE TACTICS EMPLOYED BY POLICE </p><p>EARLIER THIS WEEK IN EVICTING SOME VETERANS FROM FARMS ON </p><p>HARARE\'S OUTSKIRTS.  IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR, INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INDUSTRY MINISTER </p><p>NKOSANA MOYO SURMISED THAT LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS, IN </p><p>CAHOOTS WITH THE WAR VETERANS, MIGHT HAVE USED SUCH </p><p>TACTICS INTENTIONALLY IN ORDER TO COMPLICATE THE GOZ\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO PROCEED WITH ADDITIONAL EVICTIONS. </p><p>MEANWHILE, ACCORDING TO THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION </p><p>(CFU), THE EVICTIONS ARE CONTINUING.
