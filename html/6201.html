(C) AS OF MARCH 10, CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING U.S. </p><p>TROOPS TO SUPPORT POTENTIAL ACTION IN IRAQ MAY TRANSIT </p><p>CROATIAN AIRSPACE WITH THE STANDARD ICAO FLIGHT PLAN AS THE </p><p>ONLY ADVANCE WARNING REQUIRED, PROVIDED THEY DO NOT INTEND TO </p><p>LAND.  TWENTY-FOUR HOURS ADVANCE NOTICE IS REQUIRED FOR </p><p>FLIGHTS WHICH INTEND TO LAND AND REFUEL.  THE GOC INTERAGENCY </p><p>WORKING GROUP FINALIZED MODALITIES AND STANDARD OPERATING </p><p>PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT THE FEBRUARY 26 GOVERNMENT DECISION </p><p>TO PROVIDE LIMITED LOGISTICS SUPPORT TO THE U.S.  THE </p><p>PROCEDURES ARE (FOR CROATIA) SURPRISINGLY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND </p><p>SHOULD PROVE SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT.  THE FEBRUARY 26 DECISION </p><p>DID NOT AUTHORIZE TROOPS TO DISEMBARK DURING STOPS IN </p><p>CROATIA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ON FEBRUARY 26, PM RACAN\'S CABINET PASSED A DECISION </p><p>TO AGREE TO LIMITED OVERFLIGHT, LANDING AND REFUELING FOR </p><p>CIVILIAN CONTRACT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING U.S. FORCES FOR </p><p>POTENTIAL ACTION IN IRAQ (REFTEL).  THE DECISION ALSO CREATED </p><p>AN INTER-AGENCY WORKING GROUP TO ESTABLISH MODALITIES FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00501  071648Z </p><p>ENGAGEMENT WITH THE U.S. AND TO DRAFT STANDARD OPERATING </p><p>PROCEDURES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON MARCH 7, DAO AND EMBOFF MET WITH ASSISTANT DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER FOR POLICY JELENA GRCIC POLIC, THE LEADER OF THE </p><p>WORKING GROUP.  SHE PRESENTED US WITH THE GOC\'S "PROTOCOL FOR </p><p>USING AIRSPACE AND AIRPORTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA FOR </p><p>THE NEEDS OF COALITION FORCES UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA."  THE PROTOCOL (FAXED TO EUR/SCE), </p><p>WHICH WAS REFINED IN A SERIES OF INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS, </p><p>ESTABLISHES WHAT APPEAR TO BE REASONABLE GUIDELINES FOR </p><p>NOTIFYING THE GOC OF UPCOMING OVERFLIGHT AND LANDING. </p><p> </p><p>- NO ADVANCE WARNING IS REQUIRED EXCEPT FOR A STANDARD FLIGHT </p><p>PLAN FOR USE OF CROATIA\'S AIRSPACE BY CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT WITH </p><p>NO INTENTION TO LAND OR REFUEL; </p><p> </p><p>- A MINIMUM OF 24 HOURS ADVANCE NOTICE BEFORE AIRCRAFT </p><p>ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL IS REQUIRED FOR USE OF CROATIA\'S </p><p>AIRPORTS FOR LANDING AND REFUELING; </p><p> </p><p>- CROATIA DESIGNATES ITS AIRPORTS IN SPLIT AND PULA AS </p><p>DESIGNATED LANDING SITES, BUT OTHER AIRFIELDS MAY BE USED IN </p><p>THE CASE OF SPECIFIED NEED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ASSISTANT MINISTER GRCIC POLIC EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE PROTOCOL ONLY SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZES THE USE OF </p><p>AIRPORTS BY MD-11, DC-10 AND B-767 AIRCRAFT, THE WORKING </p><p>GROUP HAS DECIDED TO INTERPRET THIS AS "AIRCRAFT SIMILAR TO </p><p>THESE TYPES."  DISMISSING AN EARLIER POTENTIAL POINT OF </p><p>CONTENTION, GRCIC POLIC TOLD US THAT AIRCRAFT COVERED BY THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00501  071648Z </p><p>PROTOCOL WOULD BE AUTHORIZED USING STANDARD CIVILIAN FLIGHT </p><p>CLEARANCES, AND WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE DESIGNATED AS "STATE </p><p>AIRCRAFT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  GRCIC POLIC TOLD US THAT THE PROCEDURES AS SPECIFIED </p><p>ABOVE WERE THE MOST FLEXIBLE HER INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP </p><p>COULD PRODUCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEBRUARY 26 DECISION; </p><p>SOME MAY EVEN PUSH THE BOUNDARIES DEFINED BY CROATIAN LAW. </p><p>SHE SHOWED US A COPY OF THE GOC INTERNAL STANDARD OPERATING </p><p>PROCEDURES FOR ACTION TO BE TAKEN UPON NOTIFICATION BY THE </p><p>USG -- THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY -- OF AN IMPENDING FLIGHT </p><p>COVERED BY THE NEW PROTOCOL.  THE PROCEDURES APPEARED TO US </p><p>TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND BUSINESSLIKE, PROVIDING FOR 24-HOUR </p><p>AVAILABILITY OF RESPONSIBLE OFFICERS IN CASE OF A REQUEST </p><p>OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p></div>
