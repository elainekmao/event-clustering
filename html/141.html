<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 08227 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  PLOTE AND THE LTTE </p><p> </p><p>REF MADRAS 3214 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>2.  ACCORDING TO TAMIL FSN WITH GOOD CONTACTS IN THE </p><p>NORTH, APPROXIMATELY 75 PLOTE MEMBERS TURNED OVER </p><p>THEIR ARMS TO THE LTTE IN JAFFNA OCTOBER 30.  THE </p><p>FSN DESCRIBED THE PLOTE FIGHTERS INVOLVED AS MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE ANTI-UMA MAHESWARAN FACTION OF PLOTE WHICH </p><p>SPLINTERED FROM THE PARENT ORGANIZATION IN JULY 1986. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  A GSL MILITARY OFFICER TOLD EMBOFF THAT THE </p><p>SRI LANKAN PRESS HAD OVERPLAYED THE "PLOTE </p><p>SURRENDER TO THE LTTE," AS FEW MEMBERS OF PLOTE </p><p>HAD IN FACT HANDED THEIR WEAPONS TO THE TIGERS. </p><p>IT WAS THE OFFICER\'S OPINION THAT THIS ACTION </p><p>WILL DO LITTLE TO CHANGE THE MILITARY BALANCE ON </p><p>THE JAFFNA PENINSULA, AS "PLOTE REALLY COULD NOT </p><p>GET MUCH MORE INACTIVE THAN THEY WERE BEFORE." </p><p>CITING REPORTS OF MINOR CLASHES BETWEEN THE LTTE </p><p>AND THE EPRLF OVER A FEW ABANDONED PLOTE </p><p>OBSERVATION POSTS IN JAFFNA, THE OFFICER SAID HE </p><p>BELIEVED A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN THE EPRLF AND THE </p><p>LTTE WAS IN THE OFFING. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH PLOTE IS THOUGHT TO BE THE </p><p>LARGEST OF THE TAMIL INSURGENT ORGANIZATIONS, IT </p><p>HAS SO FAR REFRAINED FROM WIDESCALE INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>THE GUERRILLA WAR.  PLOTE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY DORMANT </p><p>IN THE JAFFNA PENINSULA, WHICH APPEARS TO BE LARGELY </p><p>UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE LTTE.  HOWEVER, PLOTE HAS </p><p>BEEN ACTIVE IN THE NORTH-CENTRAL VAVUNIYA DISTRICT, </p><p>AND TO A LESSER DEGREE IN PARTS OF THE EAST.  WE </p><p>HAVE SEEN NO REPORTS OF A PLOTE "STAND-DOWN" </p><p>TAKING EFFECT ANYWHERE OUTSIDE OF THE JAFFNA AREA.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  AS THIS WAS BEING TYPED AMBASSADOR AND POLOFF </p><p>SPOKE WITH PRINCIPAL OF JAFFNA COLLEGE, WHO APPEARED </p><p>TO AGREE WITH GSL MILITARY OFFICER\'S ASSESSMENT </p><p>PARA 3.  HE SAID PLOTE WAS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE IN </p><p>JAFFNA, BUT THAT EPRLF WAS AND THAT SHOWDOWN BETWEEN </p><p>IT AND LTTE WAS POSSIBLE.  THE PRINCIPAL, PASSING </p><p>THROUGH COLOMBO FROM JAFFNA ON HIS WAY TO THE UNITED </p><p>STATES, SAID THAT THE PERCEPTION IN THE JAFFNA AREA </p><p>WAS THAT LTTE WAS THE STRONGER AND MORE DISCIPLINED </p><p>OF THE TWO MILITANT GROUPS.  HOWEVER, THE EPRLF </p><p>HAS CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT--BOTH MONETARY AND MORAL-- </p><p>FROM TAMILS IN EUROPE, WHO BELIEVE EPRLF MORE </p><p>LIKELY TO TRANSCEND CASTE BARRIERS THAN THE LTTE </p><p>WHICH IS GAINING INCREASING SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>JAFFNA TAMIL ELITES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN </p><p></p></div>
