<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001297 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SCE AND S/WCI </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KAWC, HR, ICTY, UN, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY/CROATIA: GOC AGAIN BACKSLIDING ON COOPERATION? </p><p>REF: A. ZAGREB 1165 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>     B. ZAGREB 925 </p><p>     C. ZAGREB 867 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Poloff Rob Silberstein, REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ICTY Zagreb ResRep Thomas Osorio told us June 5 that </p><p>the GOC is failing to deliver on a number of commitments PM </p><p>Racan gave Chief Prosecutor del Ponte during her mid-April </p><p>visit to Zagreb.  Census information was incomplete, </p><p>assistance to gain access to bank records on GOC financial </p><p>support to breakaway Croats in Bosnia has not been </p><p>forthcoming and the OTP still is in the dark regarding the </p><p>circumstances surrounding the arrest of ICTY fugitive PIFWC </p><p>Ivica Rajic in Split.  Osorio told us not to expect any new </p><p>Croatia indictments soon; del Ponte has decided to hold off </p><p>until she has accumulated a package of 3-5 indictments that </p><p>she can deliver to the GOC at one time.  GOC backsliding on </p><p>its ICTY obligations is no surprise, but it did not help that </p><p>del Ponte took the pressure off by waxing so strongly about </p><p>"improved" GOC cooperation during her visit in April.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  In a meeting June 5, ICTY Zagreb ResRep Thomas Osorio </p><p>told us that, although there was a surge in cooperation </p><p>immediately after the visit of OTP Chief Prosecutor del Ponte </p><p>to Zagreb in mid-April, since then the GOC has failed to </p><p>follow through on many of its commitments.  Of greatest </p><p>concern to the OTP is the GOC\'s failure to provide useable </p><p>census data, one of the major points of discussion between PM </p><p>Racan and del Ponte in April (ref c).  (Inter alia, the OTP </p><p>requires these data to demonstrate Serbian ethnic cleansing </p><p>in Croatia in the Milosevic trial.)  During the del Ponte </p><p>visit, Racan reportedly instructed the GOC to comply with the </p><p>OTP\'s requests, over the objections of Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>Goran Granic.  Shortly thereafter, the GOC provided the OTP </p><p>with what it asserted was a complete package of data on the </p><p>2001 census. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Osorio told us that, after careful analysis of the </p><p>data, the OTP determined that it was inadequate.  Not only </p><p>were vital information elements of the census database </p><p>withheld, approximately 340,000 census records were excluded </p><p>completely.  On May 29, Deputy Prosecutor Blewitt (del Ponte </p><p>was in Rwanda) wrote a strongly worded letter to PM Racan </p><p>stating that the GOC\'s failure to provide the census data was </p><p>a clear failure in cooperation.  Blewitt requested immediate </p><p>intervention to provide the requested data. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to Osorio, the GOC also has failed to meet </p><p>other commitments it made to del Ponte in April: </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOC has yet to provide the promised assistance to </p><p>secure access to Privredna Banka records detailing Croatian </p><p>financial transfers to the para-state of Herceg-Bosna during </p><p>the war. </p><p> </p><p>-- It has failed to certify that the 1000 pages of documents </p><p>from former Defense Minister Susak\'s personal files that the </p><p>GOC provided in early May represented the entire collection. </p><p>Osorio told us that there is reason to believe that the GOC </p><p>submission is incomplete.  OTP analysis of the Susak papers </p><p>suggests the existence of more documents.  Additionally, the </p><p>number of pages that the GOC declared to the OTP varied from </p><p>1000 to over 1300.  (Head of the GOC Office for Cooperation </p><p>with ICTY, Frane Krnic, told the Ambassador in March that </p><p>there were 1156 pages in the Susak collection.) </p><p> </p><p>-- It has not provided the OTP with any information on the </p><p>arrest of ICTY PIFWC Ivica Rajic and on the investigation </p><p>into the illegal PIFWC protection network that the HDZ </p><p>government established (ref b), even though Racan explicitly </p><p>promised del Ponte that this information would be forthcoming. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Osorio said that the only silver lining in ICTY\'s </p><p>relationship with Croatia is the excellent cooperation </p><p>provided by Croatian Chief Prosecutor Mladen Bajic.  The OTP </p><p>recently handed over to Bajic 11 boxes of physical evidence </p><p>that the ICTY collected in the Paulin Dvor war crimes case </p><p>that Bajic is pursuing.  (The Osijek court is about to begin </p><p>the trial of two retired Croatian Army officials for their </p><p> </p><p>role in the murder of 18 ethnic Serbs and one </p><p>ethnic-Hungarian in the town of Paulin Dvor in Eastern </p><p>Slavonia.  Slavko Zadnik, one of Bajic\'s deputies, tells us </p><p>that another six persons may be indicted for the crime. </p><p>Others, including former HDZ intelligence and government </p><p>officials may be indicted for covering-up the crime.) </p><p> </p><p>No new indictments soon </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Osorio said that del Ponte did not sign and forward </p><p>any new indictments to the ICTY judge for approval prior to </p><p>her departure on a three week trip to Rwanda in late May. </p><p>According to Osorio, del Ponte has decided to wait until all </p><p>Croatia indictments are ready.  Her plan is to deliver a </p><p>package of 3-5 indictments at one time to "minimize the </p><p>political shock on the GOC" (for more detail on the potential </p><p>new indictments see ref a).  Osorio said that the net result </p><p>is that we should not anticipate any new Croatian indictments </p><p>any time soon. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) No surprises here: the brief GOC-OTP honeymoon after </p><p>del Ponte\'s mid-April visit to Zagreb is over.  The Croatian </p><p>Government has returned to its disappointing but familiar </p><p>routine of shirking cooperation once the pressure is off. </p><p>While the GOC clearly deserves the lion\'s share of the blame </p><p>for not delivering fully and consistently on its ICTY </p><p>commitments, del Ponte also bears some responsibility for her </p><p>rollercoaster public relations approach.  In April, del Ponte </p><p>was all sweetness and light, announcing that "a very positive </p><p>development of cooperation had been achieved."  Less than two </p><p>months later the OTP is again complaining that the GOC has </p><p>failed to live up to its commitments.  Under such </p><p>circumstances it would not be surprising if the press -- and </p><p>even some of her IC supporters -- might begin to question del </p><p>Ponte\'s credibility. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
