(U) IN DECEMBER 8-9 POLLING, THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) WON ITS THIRD MAYORAL </p><p>ELECTION IN NINE MONTHS IN THE TOWN OF CHEGUTU, WHICH IS </p><p>ABOUT 100 KM SOUTHWEST OF HARARE IN THE TRADITIONAL </p><p>RULING PARTY STRONGHOLD OF MASHONALAND WEST PROVINCE. </p><p>MDC CANDIDATE BLESSING DHLAKAMA EDGED OUT THE ZANU-PF </p><p>CANDIDATE STANLEY MAJIRI BY FEWER THAN 500 VOTES (2,900 </p><p>TO 2,452).  VOTER TURNOUT WAS ONLY 28 PERCENT OF </p><p>REGISTERED VOTERS, BUT CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE FIVE </p><p>PERCENT TURNOUT IN THE SEPTEMBER BULAWAYO MAYORAL </p><p>CONTEST.  THE MDC ALSO WON THE APRIL MASVINGO MAYORAL </p><p>POLL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA PORTRAYED THE DECEMBER 8- </p><p>9 VOTING AS MARRED BY MDC INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE. </p><p>THE ZBC CLAIMED THAT TWO ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS WERE INJURED </p><p>IN ATTACKS BY MDC YOUTH, INCLUDING ONE IN AN INCIDENT </p><p>WHERE MDC SUPPORTERS STONED A CONVOY OF ZANU-PF VEHICLES </p><p>THAT PASSED NEAR DHLAKAMA\'S RESIDENCE.  POLICE RAIDED </p><p>THE MDC CANDIDATE\'S HOME AND ARRESTED TEN MDC SUPPORTERS </p><p>FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, ACCORDING TO THE ZBC.  MAJIRI, </p><p>THE LOSING ZANU-PF CANDIDATE, STATED HE WOULD CHALLENGE </p><p>THE ELECTION RESULT IN COURT BECAUSE OF THE POLLING-DAY </p><p>VIOLENCE.  WE HEARED FROM OTHER SOURCES, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>MOST OF THE PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE IN CHEGUTU WAS </p><p>PERPETRATED BY ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>LONG-DELAYED HARARE POLL SET </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03689  01 OF 02  121537Z </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE CHEGUTU WIN HELPS BUILD MDC MOMENTUM FOR THE </p><p>HARARE MAYORAL AND COUNCIL ELECTIONS, WHICH THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT RULED MUST TAKE PLACE BY FEBRUARY 11, 2002.  THE </p><p>DECEMBER 7 RULING OVERTURNED A HIGH COURT JUDGMENT THAT </p><p>HAD SET AN ELECTION DATE FOR DECEMBER 28, 2001.  CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU LEFT OPEN THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT THE DATE COULD BE CHANGED IF THE GOVERNMENT AMENDED </p><p>THE LAW.  THE HARARE RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION HAD </p><p>CHALLENGED THE GOVERNMENT IN COURT TO HOLD THE HARARE </p><p>ELECTIONS, WHICH UNDER THE LAW, SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE </p><p>NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO.  SINCE THE LAST COUNCIL RESIGNED </p><p>IN 1999 UNDER A CLOUD OF CORRUPTION CHARGES, HARARE HAS </p><p>BEEN RUN BY A GOVERNMENT-APPOINTED COMMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE MDC CHEGUTU WIN SHOWS THAT THE OPPOSITION </p><p>CONTINUES TO HOLD SWAY OVER URBAN AREAS, NOT THAT ITS </p><p>POPULARITY IS NECESSARILY GROWING IN THE TRADITIONAL </p><p>ZANU-PF STRONGHOLD OF MASHONALAND.  IN THE 2000 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, ZANU-PF WON THE LARGER CHEGUTU </p><p>DISTRICT, WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY RURAL, ALBEIT BY A </p><p>RELATIVELY SLENDER MARGIN.  NONETHELESS, THE VICTORY IS </p><p>A MORALE BOOSTER FOR AN OPPOSITION PARTY UNDER SIEGE, </p><p>AND A MOMENTUM-BUILDER FOR THE HARARE POLL AND THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DUE TO TAKE PLACE IN MARCH </p><p>(REPORTED SEPTEL).  THE SUPREME COURT\'S RULING ON THE </p><p>HARARE DATE HAS PROBABLY COMPLICATED THE GOZ\'S ELECTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03689  01 OF 02  121537Z </p><p>PLANNING.  IT MAY BE RELUCTANT TO HOLD THE HARARE </p><p>CONTEST -- ONE THE MDC WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY WIN -- SO SOON </p><p>BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AS IT WOULD GIVE THE </p><p>OPPOSITION EVEN MORE MOMENTUM.  THE GOZ COULD STILL </p><p>AMEND THE LAW TO PERMIT A MAYORAL ELECTION SOME TIME </p><p>AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL ONE, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN NO </p><p>INDICATION OF SUCH PLANNING TO DATE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) HOWEVER, HARARE COULD SERVE AS AN IDEAL "TRIAL </p><p>RUN" FOR THE GOZ TO PRACTICE ITS VOTE MANIPULATION </p><p>TECHNIQUES AND COULD BE AN IMPORTANT BELLWETHER FOR </p><p>VOTER TURNOUT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  IT COULD </p><p>ALSO PROVIDE US VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO THE GOZ\'S LARGER </p><p>ELECTORAL STRATEGY BY REVEALING WHAT THE GOZ PLANS TO DO </p><p>IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF POLLING PLACES, SEEKING TO </p><p>FORCE VOTERS TO VOTE IN DISTRICTS DISTANT FROM THEIR </p><p>RESIDENCES, AND IN USING VOTER ROLLS TO DISENFRANCHISE </p><p>LIKELY OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS.  THE QUESTION OF VOTER </p><p>TURNOUT REMAINS THE GREAT UNKNOWN.  THE MDC HAS LONG </p><p>PREDICTED THAT A HEAVY TURNOUT BOLSTERS THEIR PROSPECTS </p><p>AND A 5 TO 25 PERCENT URBAN TURNOUT WOULD PROBABLY </p><p>SIGNAL THE MDC\'S DOWNFALL.  IT MAY WELL BE THE CASE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT MANY VOTERS HAVE CHOSEN TO DUCK THE POLLS </p><p>AND AVOID A POSSIBLE BEATING OVER THE RELATIVELY LOW- </p><p>STAKE MAYORAL RACES, AND ARE WAITING TO LAY DOWN THEIR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7566 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03689  02 OF 02  121537Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /008W </p><p>                  ------------------4A7AD7  121538Z /38 </p><p>P 121441Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0515 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003689 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/12/11 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE OPPOSITION WINS A THIRD MAYORAL </p><p>ELECTION AND LOOKS TO WIN A FOURTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03689  02 OF 02  121537Z </p><p>BET ON THE MAIN EVENT.
