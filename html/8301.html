<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000978 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, DS/IP/SA, AND DS/DSS/ITA </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CASC, ASEC, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S POLITICAL PARTIES\' ATTEMPT TO RE-OPEN </p><p>PARLIAMENT TURNS VIOLENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 961 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On May 28, Nepal\'s political parties marched on the </p><p>Parliament House in an attempt to reconvene the dissolved </p><p>House of Representatives for two days of meetings.  Each of </p><p>the five parties participating in the day\'s protest held </p><p>seats prior to Parliament\'s dissolution in 2002, including </p><p>the Nepali Congress (NC), the Communist Party of Nepal-United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (UML), People\'s Front Nepal (PFN), Nepal </p><p>Workers and Peasant\'s Party (NWPP), and the Nepal Sadbhavana </p><p>Party (NSP).  Support for the parties\' efforts was not </p><p>universal.  The palace-aligned Rastriya Pajatantra Party </p><p>(RPP) General Secretary, Kamal Thapa, stated that his party </p><p>would not participate in the march, preferring to remain </p><p>neutral.  Former Speaker of Parliament Tara Nath Ranabhat and </p><p>former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba also refused to </p><p>participate, explaining that this would set a bad precedent </p><p>for future parliaments and is unconstitutional. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Embassy sources report that the leaders of the </p><p>political parties, including former Prime Ministers G.P. </p><p>Koirala (NC) and Mahdav Nepal (UML), headed the procession to </p><p>the Parliament House (which is collocated with the Prime </p><p>Minister\'s office and most government offices in a walled </p><p>complex) but were prevented from entering by security </p><p>personnel.  The parties then activated their alternate plan </p><p>to open their session in the Royal Nepal Academy, roughly 2 </p><p>kilometers north of Parliament.  During the travel to the </p><p>alternate site, the party cadres reportedly became violent, </p><p>throwing rocks and bricks at passing vehicles.  The police </p><p>used baton charges and tear gas to disperse the protesters. </p><p>The Embassy has received no reports of American Citizens </p><p>caught in this latest protest; however, the RSO has sent a </p><p>Security Notice through the warden system advising American </p><p>Citizens to avoid the area. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment:  The political parties\' demonstration </p><p>today is a continuation of their joint protest (reftel) </p><p>against the King\'s appointment of an interim government in </p><p>October 2002.  Today\'s particular aim was to reestablish a </p><p>constitutional body that could prompt a showdown with the </p><p>King.  The protest\'s descent into violence is another </p><p>demonstration of the parties\' inability to articulate a </p><p>constructive role for themselves in Nepal\'s political </p><p>landscape.  The violence also mars the fiftieth anniversary </p><p>celebrations marking Sir Edmund Hillary\'s and Tenzing </p><p>Norgay\'s ascent of Everest. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
