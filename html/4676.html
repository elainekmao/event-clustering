Erdogan was </p><p>welcomed by President Bush with the words `Welcome to the </p><p>home of Turkey\'s closest friend and ally\'.  All papers </p><p>report that the US President has extended support to </p><p>Turkey\'s EU entry by saying that `we are shoulder to </p><p>shoulder with Turkey in their struggle to enter the EU\'. </p><p>"Aksam" reports that Erdogan was briefed for 2 hours by </p><p>DepSecDef Wolfowitz and U/S Grossman prior to his meeting </p><p>with President Bush.  "Hurriyet" reports that top-level US </p><p>officials, including SecState Powell, Condoleezza Rice, </p><p>Wolfowitz and US Ambassador to Turkey Robert Pearson, </p><p>attended the meeting at the White House.  "Sabah" reports </p><p>that President Bush promised to call EU capitals to lobby </p><p>for an early accession date for Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkiye" reports that despite all the efforts exerted by </p><p>Turkey, EU countries stubbornly insist on delaying the start </p><p>of accession talks until 2005.  Britain, Spain, Greece, </p><p>Italy, Portugal, Ireland, and Belgium want to begin the </p><p>accession talks in 2003.  However, 8 countries led by France </p><p>and Germany insist on 2005.  In a banner front-page </p><p>headline, "Hurriyet" says that the Turkish people deserve EU </p><p>entry because Turkey has carried out reforms to meet EU </p><p>standards.  "Milliyet" reports that Ankara is planning </p><p>responses to a possible negative outcome in Copenhagen. </p><p>Options under consideration include rejecting Annan\'s Cyprus </p><p>plan, imposing economic sanctions on selected EU countries, </p><p>and rejecting automatic EU access to NATO resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cankaya Summit: "Milliyet" reports that a `security summit\' </p><p>was held at the Presidential Palace yesterday with the </p><p>participation of President Sezer, PM Abdullah Gul, and chief </p><p>of General Staff General Hilmi Ozkok.  EU accession, Cyprus, </p><p>and Iraq were the top issues of yesterday\'s meeting, and </p><p>three decisions were taken : 1. The 2005 proposal for EU </p><p>accession talks is unacceptable, 2. The EU demand for </p><p>evaluating the Turkish government\'s performance over the </p><p>next six months is acceptable, 3. A deal on Cyprus cannot be </p><p>signed before or during the EU summit.  General Ozkok </p><p>reportedly submitted an evaluation report on the Annan plan. </p><p>PM Gul will present the report to EU leaders in Copenhagen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus:  All papers report that Annan has presented the new </p><p>Cyprus plan.  "Hurriyet" reports that Annan\'s revised Cyprus </p><p>Plan does not differ very much from the initial plan, and </p><p>does not meet Turkish demands for equality and sovereignty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Constitutional Amendments: "Milliyet" reports that the </p><p>parliament amended article 76 of the constitution to clear </p><p>the way for the premiership of AKP leader Erdogan.  CHP </p><p>reportedly tried to keep the obstacles in front of Erdogan, </p><p>but to no avail.  In the end, most CHP deputies voted in </p><p>favor of the amendments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Turkey-EU and Erdogan\'s Washington visit </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Plan A: 2003; Plan B: 2004" </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli wrote in tabloid Star (12/11): "The worst- </p><p>case-scenario in Ankara\'s mind is to be given a negotiation </p><p>date in 2004.  This date seems to be the upper `acceptable\' </p><p>limit for Turkey. . AKP leader Erdogan underlined the EU </p><p>issue as the major topic to discuss with President Bush </p><p>prior to his meeting at the White House.  He believes that </p><p>Turkey\'s chances to get a negotiation date within the </p><p>acceptable parameters will increase at least 50 percent more </p><p>after meeting with Bush.  Erdogan hints that he expects </p><p>President Bush to exert even more pressure on European </p><p>leaders.  This support, of course, comes with a price. </p><p>Erdogan and his staffers believe that the price will be </p><p>Turkey\'s support for the Iraq operation.  However, there </p><p>might be another bill attached to it: Cyprus.  . It is very </p><p>likely that President Bush will promise to increase pressure </p><p>on the EU but also exert pressure on the Turkish side on the </p><p>Cyprus issue.  The revised Annan plan on Cyprus will most </p><p>likely be presented to Erdogan while he is in the United </p><p>States.  Turkey is rapidly moving toward a `take-it-or-leave- </p><p>it\' position on the Cyprus issue.  The visit of Erdogan to </p><p>the US might be a breakthrough in Turkish foreign policy." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The last 24 hours" </p><p>Zafer Atay wrote in economic-political Dunya (12/11): "It </p><p>seems there are two main scenarios for Turkey\'s membership </p><p>procedures.  First is the positive scenario, i.e. giving </p><p>Turkey a negotiation date as early as 2003, or setting a </p><p>time in 2004 for giving a date.  The so-called French-German </p><p>formula regarding a 2005 plan is the worst scenario.  The </p><p>approval of this formula has the potential to undermine </p><p>Turkish-EU relations dramatically.  It would provide the </p><p>anti-EU lobby in Turkey clear and undeniable arguments. . </p><p>Time is running out, and in only a few days we will see the </p><p>outcome.  Yet whatever the decision may be, we should never </p><p>think about giving up our efforts to meet the Copenhagen </p><p>criteria.  These are indispensable elements for Turkey and </p><p>Turkish society, and we better continue these reforms </p><p>whether or not we are admitted to the EU." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH, ACTING </p><p></p></div>
