<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001194 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AID/W: PLEASE PASS TO ANE/SA LYNN SAULS, EGAT/WID KATHY </p><p>BLAKESLEE, STATE FOR SA/RA LISA KAPLAN AND G/TIP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, OTRA, NP, Trafficking in Persons </p><p>SUBJECT:  NEPALI TRAFFICKER SENTENCED TO 75 YEARS\' </p><p>IMPRISONMENT </p><p> </p><p>Ref: 2002 Kathmandu 2168 </p><p> </p><p>1.The Nepali "Space Time Daily" reported on June 8, 2003 </p><p>that the Special Court had convicted Bhim Bahadur Basnet, </p><p>the leader of a gang involved in selling nearly one </p><p>hundred Nepali girls to the brothels in Pune, India. </p><p>Basnet, an ethnic Nepali Bhutanese refugee resident in </p><p>Nepal, was sentenced to seventy-five years\' imprisonment. </p><p>This is probably the first case since the enactment of </p><p>the Human Trafficking Control Act of 2043 (1986) in which </p><p>an individual convicted of trafficking has received the </p><p>maximum sentence.  Six other traffickers received </p><p>sentences of from twelve to thirty-six years.  The case </p><p>began when twenty-one Nepalese girls who had been sold to </p><p>Indian brothels were rescued by the NGO Maiti Nepal(one </p><p>of USAID/Nepal\'s implementing partners in the anti- </p><p>trafficking program); eleven of these girls subsequently </p><p>filed a petition with the police against the gang who had </p><p>trafficked them.  Most of the girls were between the ages </p><p>of fifteen and twenty at the time they were sold; they </p><p>were lured by the traffickers with promises of marriage </p><p>or attractive jobs.  In India they were sold for between </p><p>$800 and $1800. </p><p> </p><p>2.The paper described the sentences as "an historic </p><p>decision of the Special Courts.  It is evidence of a new </p><p>seriousness on the part of the Nepalese judiciary </p><p>concerning its role in the fight against human </p><p>trafficking. </p><p>3. Comment: The U.S. "Trafficking Victims Protection Act </p><p>of 2000" mandates that governments of affected countries </p><p>should "prescribe punishment that is sufficiently </p><p>stringent to deter and that adequately reflects the </p><p>heinous nature of the offenses (Section 108a3).  The </p><p>seventy-five year sentence handed down to Mr. Basnet </p><p>meets these criteria, and is a break from past practice </p><p>of meting out less stringent sentences for traffickers. </p><p>Post is encouraged that the judiciary is beginning to </p><p>take trafficking seriously. We will be further </p><p>encouraging the judiciary\'s role through planned training </p><p>and technical assistance under anti-trafficking and rule </p><p>of law projects funded by INL, G/TIP, and USAID.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>4.  This cable has been cleared by the Embassy Pol/Econ </p><p>section. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
