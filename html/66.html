(U)  IN JUNE 10 "ASHARQ AL-AWSAT" INTERVIEW IN </p><p>TUNIS, FON MIN SAUD AL-FAISAL TALKED ABOUT THE </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE FOREIGN MINISTERS\' MEETING ON LEBANON. </p><p>REFERRING TO KING FAHD\'S PREVIOUS EXPRESSION OF </p><p>DISGUST AND DISMAY AT EVENTS AT THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>CAMPS IN LEBANON, HE SAID HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED </p><p>TO EXPRESS HOPE THAT ALL STATES WOULD WORK TO HALT </p><p>BLOODSHED AND BRING ABOUT RECONCILIATION.  HE </p><p>ASSERTED THAT MEETING HAD REACHED A RESOLUTION TO </p><p>END THE BLOODSHED AND HOPED THE LEBANESE GOVERN- </p><p>MENT WOULD COOPERATE IN IMPLEMENTING IT.  HE ADDED </p><p>THAT ALL LEBANESE PARTIES HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO </p><p>EXERT EVERY EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT AN IMMEDIATE </p><p>CEASEFIRE. </p><p>- </p><p>2.  (U)  IN JUNE 10 EDITORIAL, "AL-RIYADH" </p><p>IS IMPLICITLY CRITICAL OF THE MEETING BY NOTING </p><p>THAT THE RESOLUTION PRODUCED WAS THE MINIMUM </p><p>EXPECTED. IT IMPLIED DISAPPROVAL OF INEFFECTIVE </p><p>CONCILIATORY RESOLUTIONS AND OF THE ARAB WORLD FOR </p><p>NOT DOING MORE TO PREVENT THE PALESTINIANS FROM </p><p>BECOMING VICTIMS.  "AL-NADWA," THE MOST VOCALLY </p><p>PRO-PALESTINIAN OF THE SAUDI PAPERS, MENTIONED </p><p>IN JUNE 8 EDITORIAL THAT SOME STATES WILL BOYCOTT </p><p>THE MEETING HELD TO DISCUSS THE WAR OF THE CAMPS </p><p>"WAGED BY THE AMAL MILITIAS."  IT ALSO CALLED FOR </p><p>EFFECTIVE ACTION AND FOR THE COUNCIL TO STAND </p><p>FIRMLY AGAINST THE ATTACKS.  JUNE 9 "AL-NADWA" </p><p>EDITORIAL IS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF NABIH BERRI. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  (U)  KING FAHD HIMSELF SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED </p><p>ANOTHER STATEMENT ON THE PALESTINIAN SITUATION </p><p>IN LEBANON.  JUNE 11 PRESS REPORTS THAT AT CON- </p><p>CLUSION OF EVENING CABINET MEETING JUNE 10, AT </p><p>WHICH SAUD REPORTED ON THE RESULTS OF THE TUNIS </p><p>MEETING, MIN INFO ALI SHAIR READ A STATEMENT IN </p><p>WHICH THE KING AFFIRMED SAUDI ARABIA\'S CONCERN FOR </p><p>THE SAFETY OF THE PALESTINIAN REFUGEES IN THE </p><p>LEBANON CAMPS.  FURTHER, SAUDI ARABIA WOULD </p><p>ATTEND ANY ARAB MEETING WHICH WOULD SERVE THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAUSE AND FIND SOLUTIONS TO STOP THE </p><p>KILLING IN LEBANON. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  SAUD\'S REMARKS PUT THE SAUDIS\' </p><p>CALL TO END THE BLOODSHED ONCE MORE ON RECORD. </p><p>MORE IMPORTANTLY, SAUD\'S PRESENCE AT THE MEETING </p><p>AND SAUDI SUPPORT FOR THE RESOLUTION SHOW SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA ONCE MORE SUPPORTING THE LEADERSHIP ROLE </p><p>OF ARAFAT DESPITE SYRIAN OPPOSITION.  (WE NOTE </p><p>FROM REFTEL SAUD CONFERRED WITH ARAFAT IN TUNIS.) </p><p>ALTHOUGH NO EDITORIALS MENTIONED SYRIA BY NAME, </p><p>ONLY THE AMAL AND BERRI, UNHAPPINESS WITH SYRIA </p><p>IS PROBABLY NOT FAR BELOW THE SURFACE.  INDEED, </p><p>WE HAVE HEARD THAT ASAD HAS BEEN ROUNDLY </p><p>CRITICIZED BY PALESTINIANS AND SAUDIS ON THE </p><p>LOCAL MAJLIS CIRCUIT FOR NOT RESTRAINING THE </p><p>SHI\'ITE ATTACKS AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN CAMPS. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  BEIRUT MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>SUDDARTH </p><p></p></div>
