<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 001702 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL/LP, DRL/PHD, AND EB/TRA </p><p>STATE FOR WHA, WHA/PPC, AND WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PGOV, KJUS, ASEC, HO, KRCM </p><p>SUBJECT: LARGEST DRUG BUST IN HONDURAN HISTORY YIELDS </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 2,000 KILOS OF COCAINE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry L. Palmer for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  On July 16 Honduran authorities seized </p><p>approximately 2,000 kilos of cocaine hidden in a secret </p><p>compartment aboard the "Broad Fire Leader," a Cayman Islands </p><p>flagged vessel that had departed Panama July 11.  The vessel </p><p>docked at French Harbor, Roatan, a small Bay Island port not </p><p>normally associated with international commerce.  The police </p><p>arrested six Honduran nationals; two crew members and four </p><p>other individuals associated with the operation.  This </p><p>seizure is being touted as the largest in Honduran history. </p><p>It raises the total amount of cocaine seized this year in </p><p>Honduras to almost 4,000 kilos.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 16 Honduran authorities seized approximately </p><p>2,000 kilos of cocaine hidden in a secret compartment aboard </p><p>the "Broad Fire Leader," a Cayman Islands flagged vessel with </p><p>registration number 731916 that had departed Panama July 11. </p><p>The vessel was docked at French Harbor, Roatan, a small port </p><p>not normally associated with international commerce. </p><p>According to press reports, police were alerted to the </p><p>presence of the vessel by an anonymous phone call.  Police </p><p>spokesman Leonel Sauceda stated that the special </p><p>investigative police, known as the DGIC had prior knowledge </p><p>concerning the ship\'s illicit activities.  Authorities </p><p>arrived on the scene at approximately 0600 but did not board </p><p>the vessel until 0700.  (Comment:  In fact, the Embassy TAT </p><p>passed intelligence information to the INL funded joint </p><p>intelligence center (CEINCO) that then forwarded the </p><p>information to the DGIC. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The ship\'s manifest stated that its cargo of beer, </p><p>tires, and electronic goods was intended for a local Honduran </p><p>business, but authorities soon determined the business did </p><p>not exist.  Due to foot-dragging by Public Ministry </p><p>prosecutors, however, police did not actually search the </p><p>vessel until approximately 1730, over 11 hours after the fist </p><p>call had been placed to the District Attorney\'s office. </p><p>Police then brought in drug sniffing dogs which alerted </p><p>authorities to the existence of drugs on the ship.  A cursory </p><p>observation of the vessel suggested a secret compartment </p><p>below the main hold.  A search of this compartment yielded 92 </p><p>packages of cocaine totaling approximately 2,000 kilos. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Police immediately arrested the ship\'s two captains, </p><p>Danley Miles Woods (38) and Edmund Kickson (49), both </p><p>Honduran nationals and residents of Roatan.  Police later </p><p>arrested four other Honduran nationals associated with the </p><p>operation: Ricky McKensi (24); Ferry McKensi (26); Chrisman </p><p>Lee McKensi (18); and Orny Johnson (19) </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
