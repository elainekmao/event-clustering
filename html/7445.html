(SBU) BOTAS Deputy General Manager Fuat Celepci told </p><p>econoff April 15 that the oil flow in the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik </p><p>(Ceyhan) pipeline had stopped completely on April 9, and that </p><p>no tankers had transported crude from Ceyhan since March 20. </p><p>Celepci said that the 6.5 million barrel storage tanks at </p><p>Ceyhan had reached near capacity by the end of March </p><p>(reftel), but a very small quantity had continued to flow </p><p>until the pumps were shut down completely on April 9. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Celepci and MFA DG for Energy Haki Akil both denied </p><p>recent press reports that Turkey had applied to the U.S. or </p><p>the U.N. to sell the Iraqi oil in storage at Ceyhan.  Celepci </p><p>noted that marketing of this oil had never been a GOT </p><p>responsibility.  At this stage, he said, the GOT was waiting </p><p>to see who or what entity would ultimately have the rights to </p><p>sell the oil.  Celepci was not certain whether U.N. workers </p><p>were still present at Ceyhan, but was following up with his </p><p>regional manager there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Akil asked econoff if the U.S. could provide any </p><p>information on the future of the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. </p><p>He also asked if there was any truth to press reports that </p><p>the U.S. and the U.K. were supporting a Kirkuk-Haifa oil </p><p>pipeline, which would pass through Jordan and end in the </p><p>Haifa Port of Israel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Action request:  We would appreciate Department\'s </p><p>guidance on the questions raised in para 4. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
