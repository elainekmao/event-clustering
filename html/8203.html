<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0140 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>MAY 21, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for May 21, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Cumhuriyet/Milli Gazete/Turkiye: It is </p><p>claimed that around 90 PKK/KADEK militants have </p><p>infiltrated into regions close to Turkish </p><p>borders, and 300 more are in motion. After </p><p>Barzani\'s IKDP, and Talabani\'s PUK, it is claimed </p><p>PKK/KADEK wants to become the third major force </p><p>in northern Iraq, and it is both continuing to </p><p>threaten Turkey, and trying to increase its </p><p>negotiation power with the US. Gathering at </p><p>Kandil Mountain in northern Iraq, the </p><p>organization\'s Presidency Council, which did not </p><p>find the US demands acceptable, dispatched 90 </p><p>militants toward the Turkish border, and moved </p><p>300 more to Gara and Gabbar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet: T.O., who was tortured by </p><p>dripping melted plastic on her arms, and whose </p><p>father was killed in front of her eyes by village </p><p>guards in Omerli township of Mardin in 1994 when </p><p>she was 12 years old, is still being threatened </p><p>to withdraw her case charging 33 village guards </p><p>with murder. T.O. and her father, Zeki Ozdemir, </p><p>were stopped by village guards and jandarma for </p><p>an ID check and taken to a farmhouse. The </p><p>officials accused her father of taking food and </p><p>ammunitions to the PKK, attacked her father with </p><p>their rifle butts, and burnt plastic on her body. </p><p>She said although her father was killed at the </p><p>scene, no legal action was taken, and the village </p><p>guards evicted them from the village a few days </p><p>later. Ramazan Demiray left his village in </p><p>Diyarbakir due to pressure to become a village </p><p>guard in 1992. In the meantime, Demiray\'s land </p><p>was used by village guards for eleven years. </p><p>After filing a petition with the local Public </p><p>Prosecutor\'s office in 2001 that his land had </p><p>being expropriated without permission, charges </p><p>were brought against the village guards. The </p><p>court ordered the village guards to pay </p><p>approximately USD 10 thousand to the land owner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Radikal/Evrensel: The provincial chairmen of </p><p>Peoples Democratic Party (DEHAP) announced in </p><p>Ankara that, instead of the "repent law" on the </p><p>agenda, a general amnesty, which would include </p><p>PKK/KADEK militants as well, should be declared </p><p>to establish reconciliation in the society. The </p><p>DEHAP Provincial Chairmen said important </p><p>developments that affected the region and Turkey </p><p>were taking place as a result of US\'s </p><p>intervention in Iraq, which created a historic </p><p>chance for resolving the Kurdish issue. They said </p><p>a non-discriminatory amnesty covering the </p><p>PKK/KADEK components as well was essential in </p><p>order to make the cessation of clashes lasting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Sabah: Dr. Hasan Arslan, the Chief Doctor of </p><p>State Hospital in Yukeskova of Hakkari, claimed </p><p>he was kidnapped by three persons two days ago. </p><p>Arslan said he had been beaten, his money and </p><p>cellular phones seized, and he had been forced to </p><p>sign promissory notes and resign from his </p><p>position after he was interrogated. Arslan said </p><p>the kidnappers had introduced themselves as </p><p>members of "Yukesekova Gang." Three of the four </p><p>persons Dr. Arslan reported were later arrested. </p><p>Special Operations Team members, village guards, </p><p>the mayor, and PKK confessors were tried at court </p><p>for membership in the "Yukeskova Gang" some time </p><p>ago. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Turkiye: Security forces from the 3rd Border </p><p>Battalion in Caldiran of Van arrested 81 </p><p>Pakistani nationals near Soguksu village at the </p><p>Iranian border. The arrestees, after being taken </p><p>to the infirmary in Caldiran for a physical </p><p>examination, were relased by the court for </p><p>extradition. Two Turkish national harboring the </p><p>fugitives were detained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Milliyet/Hurriyet: The President of Adana\'s </p><p>Street Children Association, Prof. Dr. Fazilet </p><p>Aksu, said because of eastern and southeastern </p><p>families\' desire to move to bigger towns to </p><p>improve their economic lives the number of the </p><p>street children increased. At a conference by </p><p>Adana\'s Chamber of Pharmacists, Prof. Aksu said </p><p>the situation of the street children aged between </p><p>12 and 14 had become an acute wound in the </p><p>society. Aksu added that they conducted </p><p>interviews with approximately 500 street children </p><p>who mostly had migrated from Sanliurfa, Mardin, </p><p>Diyarbakir, Siirt, and Kayseri provinces. The </p><p>children said their families had moved to Adana, </p><p>Istanbul, and Izmir in order to improve their </p><p>economic conditions, but the migration had </p><p>scattered the household members. In order to </p><p>contribute to their families\' income, the young </p><p>children sell chewing gum, wipe windshields of </p><p>the cars, and beg. Aksu said the majority of the </p><p>children were illiterate, and were exposed to </p><p>abuse and various diseases. Aksu mentioned that </p><p>the association did not have the power to provide </p><p>a humane life for those children, and the state </p><p>did not fulfil its obligation in that regard. The </p><p>Security Directorate of Adana estimated the </p><p>number of street children at five thousand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Bolge: Adana Provincial Jandarma Command </p><p>announced that 34,029 roots of hemp, 300 hemp </p><p>seeds, and 215 grams of heroin were seized in </p><p>four separate operations in Adana, and four </p><p>persons were detained in connection with the </p><p>drugs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Milliyet/Hurriyet: The Young Businessmen </p><p>Association opened a branch in Mersin, MEGIAD. </p><p>MEGIAD\'s Executive Board President, Mehmet </p><p>Karalar, said, within the framework of democratic </p><p>order of Turkey and in the light of Ataturk\'s </p><p>principles, they had founded the association in </p><p>Mersin to contribute to the economic, social and </p><p>cultural development of the town. Karalar said </p><p>they would fulfil their obligations as a business </p><p>association and an NGO, and would try to find </p><p>remedies to economic issues by arranging economic </p><p>forums. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
