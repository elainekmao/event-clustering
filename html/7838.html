Between 1 and 2 May, the DART traveled to An Nasiriyah. </p><p>Accompanied by GOAL and IMC, the DART visited two hospitals </p><p>and local water and sewage treatment facilities.  The DART </p><p>attended the CMOC briefing on 2 May, during which, local </p><p>leaders presented the town\'s most critical needs: food, </p><p>propane, hospital security, and medicines.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART toured An Nasiriyah\'s Maternal and Pediatric </p><p>Hospital on 1 May.  All patients had been discharged five to </p><p>six hours before the hospital was hit by a bomb.  As a </p><p>result of the damage, 40 of the hospital\'s 300 beds are not </p><p>available, but the hospital is operational.  The current </p><p>patient breakdown is 40 percent OB/GYN and 60 percent </p><p>pediatric.  Most of the pediatric patients are suffering </p><p>from gastro-intestinal problems (water-borne diseases) and </p><p>upper respiratory infections.  Prior to the war, the </p><p>hospital reportedly performed 3,000 surgical procedures per </p><p>month.  Now between 200 and 400 surgeries are performed per </p><p>month.  There are now 400 vaginal deliveries, 300 caesarian </p><p>sections, and 200 other gynecological surgeries per month. </p><p>Fewer than one third of the hospital\'s incubators are </p><p>functional. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Most of the hospital\'s staff has returned to work, </p><p>including eight OB/GYN physicians, eleven pediatricians, </p><p>five anesthesia personnel, eight nurse midwives, and 70 </p><p>nurses.  The hospital only has the capacity to provide </p><p>intermittent salaries to some of the staff.  Potable water </p><p>is available by tanker and non-potable water though the </p><p>municipal water system.  There are no laboratory culture </p><p>capabilities, and the pharmaceutical supplies are being </p><p>rapidly depleted.  The hospital\'s main problems are poor </p><p>night-time security, only one anesthesia machine, a lack of </p><p>re-training for staff, and a lack of oxygen.  Oxygen </p><p>(medical-grade by local standards) is available from a local </p><p>contractor at seven times the normal price. The </p><p>International Medical Corps (IMC) expects to have a master </p><p>list of all supplies needed in all three of An Nasiriyah\'s </p><p>hospitals by 5 May. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART also visited the Republic Hospital, which </p><p>mainly treated emergency, dialysis, and urology cases.  The </p><p>100-bed hospital has been almost completely destroyed by a </p><p>combination of bomb damage and looting.  Almost all of the </p><p>windows in the hospital were broken.  However, according to </p><p>the hospital\'s director, the facility was in very poor </p><p>condition even before the war.  There were four patients in </p><p>the hospital\'s two open wards during the DART\'s visit. </p><p>According to the hospital director, eight operations were </p><p>performed in the last week.  The hospital has only two </p><p>respirators and no oxygen.  Air has been used as a </p><p>substitute in the respirators for the past two weeks.  The </p><p>hospital\'s laboratory closes at noon each day due to the </p><p>lack of staff.  All three of the hemodialysis units were </p><p>looted, forcing the hospital to resort to peritoneal </p><p>dialysis.  However, the hospital has only a very small </p><p>supply of the catheters necessary for the peritoneal </p><p>dialysis.  The three looted hemodialysis units were the only </p><p>three in the entire governorate of 1.5 million people.  The </p><p>hospital\'s infectious disease unit is inoperable as the door </p><p>for the isolation room was looted. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>WATER AND SEWAGE TREAMENT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  According to GOAL, An Nasiriyah\'s water and sewage </p><p>treatment plant would require only small interventions to </p><p>become operable.  The staff is available and ready to work. </p><p>The DART visited the plant\'s administrative offices, where </p><p>all the doors, windows, and furniture were looted.  The DART </p><p>also visited the sewage treatment facility, which is </p><p>operating at between 30 and 70 percent of capacity because </p><p>of a lack of maintenance and spare parts.  Since before the </p><p>war, the facility has been relying on temporary pumps as </p><p>there are no parts to repair the permanent pumps.  Due to </p><p>the use of the temporary pumps, the system is being bypassed </p><p>and wastewater is being released untreated. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The DART also visited the water treatment plant, where </p><p>only seven out of the fourteen pumps are operating.  As a </p><p>result, the plant has no standby capacity.  The plant has </p><p>less than one week\'s supply of chlorine left, according to </p><p>GOAL. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FUEL </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>7.  On 1 May, GOAL reported that the supply of propane gas </p><p>is virtually non-existent in An Nasiriyah.  On 23 April, </p><p>looters broke into the propane factory, manually opened the </p><p>valves, and filled bottles with propane, leaving a dangerous </p><p>residue of sulphur and vapor in the tanks.  On 29 April, two </p><p>people were killed and two more seriously burned, when </p><p>looters attempted to break into the pipeline to fill bottles </p><p>manually. </p><p> </p><p>8.  GOAL is attempting to confirm whether the propane plant </p><p>in Basrah is operational and what capacity it has.  If the </p><p>plant is operating, GOAL is considering organizing trucks </p><p>and bottles to go to Basrah in order to supply An Nasiriyah. </p><p>Prior to the war, An Nasiriyah\'s propane consumption level </p><p>was 11,000 bottles per day.  GOAL believes that any propane </p><p>supplies to An Nasiriyah must consist of at least 5,000 </p><p>bottles per day, to avoid civil unrest. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>CIVIL MILITARY OPERATIONS CENTER MEETING </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The DART attended the daily Civil Military Operations </p><p>Center (CMOC) briefing on 2 May.  Several City Council </p><p>leaders told the DART that propane was needed desperately in </p><p>An Nasiriyah.  Food was also named as a priority need; food </p><p>items such as milk and cheese are unavailable.  However, </p><p>there are sufficient supplies of dry foods available. </p><p>Employees have gone three months without pay.  According to </p><p>the city\'s hospital director, security is the hospital\'s </p><p>priority need.  Medicines are also needed, and what drugs </p><p>are available are of a very low quality.  Contact with other </p><p>centers is also difficult because of the lack of operational </p><p>communications equipment. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
