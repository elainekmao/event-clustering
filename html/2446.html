<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 001025 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/01/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PINS, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: PUBLIC PROTESTS GROW IN THE FACE OF FARC </p><p>ATTACKS </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) BOGOTA 00918 B) BOGOTA 00879 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON FOR REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: AS THE FARC\'S WAVE OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>DESTRUCTION CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, PRESIDENT </p><p>PASTRANA MET WITH HIS TOP MILITARY AND CIVILIAN ADVISORS </p><p>TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO COMBAT THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS. </p><p>MEANWHILE, POPULAR ATTITUDES ARE HARDENING AGAINST THE </p><p>FARC, AS PEOPLE TAKE TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST THE </p><p>INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>ATTACKS CONTINUE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE FARC\'S WAVE OF VIOLENCE CONTINUES, DESPITE </p><p>THE GROWING POPULAR CONDEMNATION OF THE GUERRILLA </p><p>ATTACKS.  ON JANUARY 30, THE FARC DETONATED A CAR BOMB </p><p>BEHIND THE CARACOL TV AND RADIO BUILDING IN CENTRAL </p><p>BOGOTA.  NO ONE WAS HURT IN THE ATTACK, BUT SIX PEOPLE </p><p>WERE KILLED AND 25 WERE INJURED IN FLORENCIA (CAQUETA </p><p>DEPARTMENT) WHEN THE FARC ACTIVATED A BOMB WHILE A </p><p>MILITARY CONVOY WAS PASSING BY.  THEY ALSO EXPLODED TWO </p><p>PACKAGE BOMBS IN FRONT OF THE ARMY\'S 5TH MECHANIZED </p><p>DIVISION BARRACKS IN MEDELLIN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>NEW SECURITY MEASURES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ON JANUARY 31, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT ANDRES </p><p>PASTRANA HELD A SECURITY SUMMIT WITH HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>POLITICAL AND MILITARY OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS MEASURES TO </p><p>COMBAT THE FARC OFFENSIVE.  THE SUMMIT WAS ATTENDED BY </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTER ARMANDO ESTRADA, JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>ROMULO GONZALEZ, VICE PRESIDENT AND DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>GUSTAVO BELL, ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL JORGE ENRIQUE MORA, </p><p>NAVY COMMANDER ADMIRAL SOTO, POLICE DIRECTOR LUIS </p><p>ERNESTO GILIBERT AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>SECURITY (DAS - FBI EQUIVALENT) DIRECTOR COLONEL GERMAN </p><p>GUSTAVO JARAMILLO.  SUBSEQUENTLY, PRESIDENT PASTRANA </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS IMPLEMENTING THE </p><p>FOLLOWING SECURITY MEASURES: </p><p> </p><p>-- INSPECTION CHECKPOINTS AT THE ENTRANCES AND EXITS OF </p><p>ALL CITIES; </p><p> </p><p>-- MOBILE CHECKPOINTS INSIDE THE CITIES; </p><p> </p><p>-- RAIDS OF SITES WHERE ATTACKS ARE BEING PLANNED; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- AN INCREASE OF FUNDS TO PAY INFORMANTS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>GROWING PROTESTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE NEW MEASURES WERE ANNOUNCED AS PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION CONCERNING THE FARC\'S TACTICS HAS TURNED </p><p>STRONGLY AGAINST THE GUERRILLAS.  ON WEDNESDAY, JANUARY </p><p>30, THE RESIDENTS OF META PROVINCE HELD A 15-MINUTE </p><p>"POT-BANGING PROTEST" TO VOICE THEIR OBJECTION TO THE </p><p>FARC\'S RECENT ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, WHILE BOGOTA MAYOR </p><p>ANTANAS MOCKUS LED A SIMILAR PROTEST IN NORTHERN BOGOTA. </p><p>THIS PROTEST FOLLOWED A THREE-MINUTE "LIGHTS-OUT" IN </p><p>BOGOTA TO PROTEST THE FARC\'S ATTACKS ON THE </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH HAVE DESTROYED SCORES OF </p><p>ELECTRICAL PYLONS AND HAVE DAMAGED A MAJOR WATER SUPPLY </p><p>FOR THE CAPITAL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) EVEN THOSE WHO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS HAVE CONDEMNED THE FARC ATTACKS.  INGRID </p><p>BETANCOURT, AN INDEPENDENT "GREEN" PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATE, SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE FARC AND CALLED ON THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS TO CEASE THESE ATTACKS.  ANDERS KOMPASS, </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN COLOMBIA, DESCRIBED THE </p><p>ATTACKS AS "DEPLORABLE" AND "COUNTERPRODUCTIVE." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WHILE IT IS NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER THE COLMIL HAS </p><p>RE-DEPLOYED FROM ITS STAGING POINT OUTSIDE OF THE FARC\'S </p><p>SAFE HAVEN ("DESPEJE"), DAO REPORTS THAT THE COLAR\'S </p><p>21ST BATTALION BASED IN GRANADA HAS BEEN DEFENDING KEY </p><p>POPULATION CENTERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE REGION </p><p>AROUND THE DESPEJE (REF B).  THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCE </p><p>(FUDRA) ALSO HAS BEEN CONDUCTING OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS </p><p>AGAINST THE FARC\'S 26TH FRONT AND IS STILL FORWARD </p><p>DEPLOYED IN META DEPARTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ANALYSTS HAVE POSITED A NUMBER OF THEORIES ABOUT </p><p>THE FARC\'S ONGOING OFFENSIVE.  SOME SENIOR MILITARY AND </p><p>POLICE OFFICIALS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE FARC HAS </p><p>MARKEDLY STEPPED UP ITS ATTACKS AROUND BOGOTA, </p><p>SUGGESTING THAT THE GUERRILLAS MIGHT BE TRYING TO </p><p>ISOLATE THE CAPITAL.  MANY OBSERVERS ALSO BELIEVE THE </p><p>FARC\'S ACTIONS ARE MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>THEIR MILITARY CAPABILITIES, APPARENTLY IN THE HOPES OF </p><p>BOLSTERING THEIR LEVERAGE AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. </p><p>ANOTHER THEORY IS THAT THE FARC IS STEPPING UP ITS </p><p>ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO DRAW COLMIL </p><p>FORCES AWAY FROM THE DESPEJE -- IN EFFECT, FORCING THE </p><p>MILITARY TO LOOSEN THE SECURITY CONTROLS ON THE FARC </p><p>SAFE HAVEN, SOMETHING THAT THE GOC HAD REFUSED TO DO IN </p><p>THE NEGOTIATIONS.  WHATEVER THEIR MOTIVES, THE FARC\'S </p><p>LATEST OFFENSIVE MIGHT BE A PYHRRIC VICTORY.  WHILE </p><p>THEIR ATTACKS HAVE HAD A PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT ON THE </p><p>POPULACE (ESPECIALLY IN THE CITIES), THESE ACTIONS HAVE </p><p>PRODUCED A POLITICAL REACTION THAT ULTIMATELY UNDERMINES </p><p>THE FARC\'S INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p></p></div>
