REFTEL REQUESTED POST CONDUCT A PRE-LICENSE CHECK ON </p><p>SAFEWATER CHEMICALS FOR THE EXPORT OF ELEVEN NICKEL-LINED PUMPS </p><p>FOR USE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CHEMICALS USED IN THE OIL AND GAS </p><p>INDUSTRY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   ON APRIL 29, 2003, COMMERCIAL OFFICER MARY O\'BRIEN MET WITH </p><p>MARK CONNER OF AL JABER ENERGY SERVICES, WHO IS THE PROJECT </p><p>MANAGER FOR THE SAFEWATER PROJECT.  (NOTE: COMOFF O\'BRIEN HAD </p><p>PREVIOUSLY MET WITH MR. CONNER IN MARCH 2003 REGARDING THE NEED </p><p>FOR EXPORT LICENSES FOR THE SAFEWATER FACILITY.)  AL JABER GROUP, </p><p>OF WHICH AL JABER ENERGY SERVICES IS A PART, IS A HUGE </p><p>CONGLOMERATE INDUSTRIAL FIRM HERE IN THE UAE WITH BUSINESSES </p><p>INVOLVED IN GENERAL CONTRACTING; MARINE WORKS; IRON, STEEL, </p><p>REBAR, AND ALUMINUM FABRICATION; ASPHALT PRODUCTION; AND HEAVY </p><p>EQUIPMENT SALES.  IN 2001, AL JABER\'S GROSS REVENUE WAS $410 </p><p>MILLION.  THEIR MAIN FACILITY CONSISTS OF 500,000 SQUARE METERS </p><p>ON THE SEASIDE OF MUSSAFAH, ABU DHABI\'S NEW INDUSTRIAL AREA. </p><p> </p><p>3.   AL JABER HAS RECENTLY BEGUN CONSTRUCTION ON A CHLOR-ALKALI </p><p>PLANT THAT IS ABOUT A TEN MINUTE DRIVE WITHIN MUSSAFAH FROM AL </p><p>JABER\'S MAIN FACILITY WHERE MR. CONNER\'S OFFICE IS LOCATED.  THIS </p><p>FACILITY WILL MANUFACTURE HYDROCHLORIC ACID, SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE </p><p>(BLEACH), AND CAUSTIC SODA.  THESE PRODUCTS ARE EXTENSIVELY USED </p><p>IN OIL WELLS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES SUCH AS WATER </p><p>PURIFICATION, PAPER MILLS, AND ALUMINUM (SPELLED ALUMINIUM HERE) </p><p>PROCESSING.  IN FACT, WHEN COMMOFF WENT TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE, </p><p>THERE ARE A PAPER MILL AND AN ALUMINUM EXTRUSION FACILITY VISIBLE </p><p>FROM THE PLOT WHERE THE PLANT IS BEING BUILT. </p><p> </p><p>4.   SAFEWATER HAS PURCHASED AROUND $9 MILLION OF OTHER U.S. </p><p>EQUIPMENT FOR THIS PROJECT, MOST OF WHICH WILL COME FROM IONICS </p><p>IN WATERTOWN, MA.  THIS EQUIPMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE EXPORT </p><p>LICENSES BASED ON INFORMATION MR. CONNER HAS RECEIVED FROM </p><p>IONICS. </p><p> </p><p>5.   BECAUSE OF THE HIGHLY CAUSTIC NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCES BEING </p><p>PRODUCED THE FACILITY WILL REQUIRE THE ELEVEN NICKEL-LINED PUMPS </p><p>LISTED ON THIS LICENSE.  IN ADDITION, IN ORDER TO PRODUCE CAUSTIC </p><p>SODA, SAFEWATER WILL UTILIZE AN EVAPORATOR WHICH INCORPORATES A </p><p>NICKEL-LINED PUMP ALSO FROM GOULDS.  THAT PUMP IS THE SUBJECT OF </p><p>EXPORT LICENSE D305336.  THE PUMP WILL BE SENT TO GEA IN FRANCE, </p><p>INCORPORATED INTO THE EVAPORATOR AND THEN EXPORTED TO THE UAE. </p><p> </p><p>6.   ON MAY 3, 2003, COMMOFF O\'BRIEN SPOKE WITH AHMED SOBHI, </p><p>SALES MANAGER, DAFF TRADING, ABU DHABI.  MR SOBHI SAID THAT DAFF </p><p>TRADING HAS BEEN THE AGENT FOR GOULDS PUMPS IN THE UAE FOR OVER </p><p>15 YEARS.  HE SAID THAT WHEN DAFF SENDS A PURCHASE ORDER TO </p><p>GOULDS, DAFF IS REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY THE END USER AND END-USE TO </p><p>GOULDS.  SAFEWATER PLACED A PURCHASE ORDER FOR 25 PUMPS </p><p>ALTOGETHER WITH DAFF. IN THE QUOTE TO SAFEWATER DAFF INFORMED </p><p>SAFEWATER THAT AN EXPORT LICENSE WAS REQUIRED FOR THE EXPORT OF </p><p>THE ELEVEN NICKEL-LINED PUMPS.  MR. SOBHI EXPLAINED TO COMOFF </p><p>THAT THE PUMPS WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE PORT HERE IN THE UAE AND </p><p>THEN CLEARED THROUGH CUSTOMS BY DAFF.  THE PUMPS WILL THEN BE </p><p>DELIVERED TO SAFEWATER\'S FACILITY IN MUSSAFAH.  MR. SOBHI KNOWS </p><p>THE RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTING ALL OF GOULDS\' PRODUCTS TO </p><p>SANCTIONED COUNTRIES AND IS AWARE DAFF MUST ABIDE BY ALL </p><p>CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT BE IMPOSED ON THE LICENSE. </p><p> </p><p>7.   AS A SIDE NOTE, THE UAE HAS BEGUN THE REGISTRATION PROCESS </p><p>FOR CHEMICAL COMPANIES IN THE UAE.  THEREFORE IF ANY OF THE </p><p>CHEMICALS PRODUCED AT SAFEWATER\'S FACILITY ARE SUBJECT TO CWC </p><p>VERIFICATION, THE MECHANISM FOR REGISTRATION AND REPORTING IS </p><p>UNDERWAY. </p><p> </p><p>8.   RECOMMENDATION:  COMMOFF RECOMMENDS DAFF TRADING AND </p><p>SAFEWATER CHEMICALS AS RELIABLE RECIPIENTS OF CONTROLLED U.S. </p><p>ORIGIN COMMODITIES AND TECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
