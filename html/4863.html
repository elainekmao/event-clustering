<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 005526 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, US, FR, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: IN WAKE OF FATAL ACCIDENT GOK SEEKS TIGHTER </p><p>CONTROL OF JOURNALISTS COVERING US FORCES -- FOR THEIR </p><p>SAFETY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>See action request in para 4. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In the course of a December 25 meeting on other topics </p><p>(septels), the Ambassador and Kuwait Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs Dr. Shaykh Mohammed al-Sabah discussed the </p><p>December 22 death of French journalist Patrick Bourrat as a </p><p>result of injuries he suffered the preceding day while </p><p>covering a training exercise at the Udairi Range.  Dr. </p><p>Mohammed asked the Ambassador whether the French had sought </p><p>an explanation for the accident. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador informed Dr. Mohammed that he had </p><p>received a letter from his French colleague, Ambassador </p><p>Claude Losguardi, on December 23 requesting a report from the </p><p>Commanding General of Third Army as to the exact </p><p>circumstances of the accident and the nature of the medical </p><p>care that Bourrat had received thereafter.  In response, the </p><p>Embassy had provided a preliminary report prepared by the </p><p>U.S. military.  When the final report was available it would </p><p>also be provided.  At Dr. Mohammed\'s request, he shared a </p><p>copy of Losgaurdi\'s letter and the preliminary report with </p><p>him.  (See texts in paragraphs 5 and 6, respectively.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) After perusing the preliminary report, Dr. Mohammed </p><p>commented that it seemed clear that Bourrat\'s own actions had </p><p>cost him his life.  Nonetheless, Dr. Mohammed was troubled </p><p>that Bourrat had been able to leave a safe area to get in the </p><p>way of the tank that hit him.  The report did not address how </p><p>this happened.  He argued that by allowing journalists to </p><p>observe its activities the U.S. military was implicitly </p><p>assuming responsibility for their safety; procedures should </p><p>have been in place to prevent this.  He urged the U.S. to </p><p>consider instituting such procedures.  At the very least, the </p><p>U.S. should insist that journalists sign some form of a </p><p>release of liability that states that they understand the </p><p>rules for their being allowed access to a hazardous event and </p><p>agree to abide by them.  The Ambassador asked Dr. Mohammed </p><p>whether this was an official request.  Dr. Mohammed said that </p><p>it was; the MFA would follow up in writing. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST:  Although a Ministry of </p><p>Defense official had earlier complained to us about </p><p>inflammatory "on to Baghdad" media coverage of recent </p><p>training exercises, Dr. Mohammed made no reference to any </p><p>such concern.  His focus was completely on the safety of the </p><p>journalists and the desire to avoid any future accidents.  In </p><p>this regard, we believe that he has made a useful suggestion. </p><p> If it\'s not already the practice, a standard legal release </p><p>for journalists\' signature that made it clear they understood </p><p>the rules for an event and agreed to abide by them (perhaps </p><p>under penalty of being excluded from participation in future </p><p>events) could help prevent future accidents, or at least </p><p>mitigate any diplomatic / legal fallout from them.  As the </p><p>Ambassador told Dr. Mohammed, there will be a lull in </p><p>training activity for the next few weeks anyway.  Now would </p><p>be a good time to consider how to tighten procedures, </p><p>including possibly the introduction of such a standard legal </p><p>release, before field activities resume in earnest.  (We may </p><p>even want to insist that the journalists\' employers agree to </p><p>the release to make the point that they share responsibility </p><p>for their employees\' behavior.) We recommend that action </p><p>addressees consider this suggestion seriously.  Please </p><p>advise. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Text of Losguardi Letter (informal embassy </p><p>translation of French original) </p><p> </p><p>"Mr. Ambassador, dear colleague, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for calling me to express your compassion and </p><p>sympathy following the accident that cost the life of Mr. </p><p>Patrick Bourrat, TF1 journalist, while he was covering </p><p>maneuvers of U.S. forces in the north of Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>I would greatly appreciate it if you would intervene with the </p><p>commanding general of Third Army to conduct an investigation </p><p>as soon as possible to determine the exact circumstances of </p><p>Mr. Bourrat\'s accident as well as the nature of the care </p><p>provided to him by the American medical team at the Kuwait </p><p>Armed Forces hospital. </p><p> </p><p>Thanking you for your cooperation, please accept Mr. </p><p>Ambassador and dear colleague, the expression of my warm </p><p>regards," signed Claude Losguardi </p><p> </p><p>6.
