<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001610 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR A/S KANSTEINER </p><p>AF/S FOR DELISI AND KRAFT </p><p>AF/RA FOR JOHN WALSER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: THE TAKE FROM ZIMBABWE ON WORKING WITH UNSC 1373 </p><p>AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO BOLSTER AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 128067 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY DCM ROBERT E. WHITEHEAD </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Embassy Harare strongly endorses the use of SADC to </p><p>bolster counterterrorism efforts in this region generally, </p><p>and specifically in the Zimbabwe context.  On the ground in </p><p>Zimbabwe, we have enjoyed close, instantaneous and productive </p><p>cooperation from the Zimbabwean security services, both </p><p>police and intelligence, on counterterrorism (CT) matters. </p><p>To date, this collaboration has produced tangible results. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In other areas, both on the political and economic </p><p>planes, we have fared less well.  Following September 11, the </p><p>GOZ paid ample lip service to counterterrorism and, at our </p><p>request, offered a senior MFA official as their point of </p><p>contact with us.  In practical terms, this has yielded almost </p><p>nothing.  Consumed by pre-electoral politics, obsessed by the </p><p>notion of an anti-Zimbabwe conspiracy in the West, and now </p><p>facing famine and a catastrophic economic decline, the </p><p>preoccupied Zimbabweans have taken action in virtually none </p><p>of the non-operational CT areas where we solicited </p><p>cooperation.  There has been no movement on parliamentary </p><p>ratification of several unsigned UN counterterrorism </p><p>conventions or Central Bank pressure for stiffer anti-money </p><p>laundering legislation that has real teeth.  Given our </p><p>current estrangement from the GOZ, and a virtual (GOZ </p><p>imposed) freeze on relations with the MFA, we harbor little </p><p>hope that additional lobbying efforts on this end will yield </p><p>the results we seek. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In this context, SADC is probably the best vehicle </p><p>available to engage the Zimbabweans constructively on </p><p>counterterrorism issues of importance to us.  The GOZ has </p><p>apparently not engaged the UN Counterterrorism Council to </p><p>date, but we think that they would be more responsive to </p><p>regional pressure to undertake regional initiatives or to </p><p>coordinate to a greater degree with the UN.  In the event </p><p>that USG contacts with SADC present opportunities for greater </p><p>multilateral CT activities, we think that it would be in our </p><p>own interest to make certain that Zimbabweans are encouraged </p><p>and allowed to participate. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
