Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On March 26, Turkish General Staff CHOD General Hilmi </p><p>Ozkok issued a public statement on the current presence of TU </p><p>forces in northern Iraq and future Turkish intentions in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Following are excerpts of the statement (a complete </p><p>English-language text will follow septel): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Certain elements of the Turkish Armed Forces are currently </p><p>in northern Iraq; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Turkish forces are not planning to intervene in the region </p><p>unless there is an attack against Turkish forces there, </p><p>unless there is a refugee influx, unless one of the groups in </p><p>the region attacks the other, or unless the civilian </p><p>population is attacked. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Turkish forces are not planning to send additional forces </p><p>to northern Iraq; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The United States is currently waging a war in the region, </p><p>and when we (the Turks) send units there (northern Iraq), </p><p>coordination will be conducted; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Turkish forces do not intend to fight or to invade; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Turkish forces are not there (northern Iraq) permanently; </p><p>and, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Turkish forces will not engage in clashes in the region </p><p>other than in order to defend themselves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Ozkok also expressed concern about what he described </p><p>as the "suspicious </p><p>attitudes" of certain institutions, international </p><p>organizations, and certain allied countries regarding </p><p>Turkey\'s position, including criticism leveled by foreign </p><p>countries who feel threatened by the efforts of the Turkish </p><p>forces, who are making preparations because of the </p><p>developments in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  Ozkok\'s statement stands on its own. </p><p>Seeking further elaboration at this time could expose </p><p>divisions within TGS or with the GOT.  We recommend that the </p><p>USG refrain from asking the Turks to elaborate on Ozkok\'s </p><p>statement before SPE Khalilzad returns to Ankara for his </p><p>March 29 meetings with the Turks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Amb. Khalilzad has cleared this message. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
