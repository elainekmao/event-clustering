<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001661 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, </p><p>PRM/ANE, AND IO/UNP </p><p>KUWAIT FOR HOC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 04/07/13 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: FRUSTRATED BY ICRC IDLENESS, UAE RED </p><p>CRESCENT AUTHORITY DECIDES TO GO IT ALONE </p><p> </p><p>REFS: ABU DHABI 1602 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: The UAE Red Crescent </p><p>Authority (RCA) hosted on 4/6 in Abu Dhabi a forum of </p><p>international aid organizations to discuss the </p><p>humanitarian situation in Iraq.  This was the first </p><p>major meeting of the International Federation of Red </p><p>Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRCS), the </p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and </p><p>the national societies of the UAE, Jordan, Turkey, </p><p>Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar </p><p>since the war in Iraq began.  Frustrated by the outcome </p><p>of the meeting and ICRC\'s continued refusal to permit </p><p>the national societies immediate entry into Iraq, the </p><p>UAE RCA has decided to circumvent ICRC channels and </p><p>organize a major humanitarian shipment (leaving the UAE </p><p>for Umm Qasr on 4/8) directly through AmEmbassy Abu </p><p>Dhabi and the HOC.  We continue to coordinate the </p><p>details of this shipment with the HOC in Kuwait, </p><p>CENTCOM, and NAVCENT, all of which recognize the </p><p>political sensitivities and are helping us manage this </p><p>delicate situation.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>ICRC Refuses To Cooperate With National Societies </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA) Secretary </p><p>General San\'a Al-Kitbi confirmed to Econoff on 4/7 that </p><p>the ICRC heretofore has sought to prevent national Red </p><p>Crescent Societies from entering Iraq.  The ICRC argues </p><p>that the security situation in many areas of Iraq is </p><p>too dangerous for Red Crescent workers, and the Iraqi </p><p>Government has refused access to regime-controlled </p><p>areas.  (Note: ICRC typically requires permission from </p><p>all parties to a conflict before it can begin </p><p>humanitarian operations.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Al-Kitbi reported that ICRC had interdicted </p><p>national societies\' humanitarian convoys into Iraq, and </p><p>taken possession of the humanitarian supplies at the </p><p>border under the pretense that ICRC staff would </p><p>distribute the items.  According to Al-Kitbi, it is </p><p>well known that the ICRC has only minimal staff in Iraq </p><p>and therefore warehouses the goods for later </p><p>distribution.  "Our workers know the risks and dangers, </p><p>but we must be with the people of Iraq," said Al-Kitbi. </p><p>"This is the purpose of the Red Crescent." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) According to Al-Kitbi, the national societies\' </p><p>delegates convened in Abu Dhabi yesterday to insist </p><p>that the ICRC allow them to enter Iraq.  The exchange </p><p>between the ICRC and national societies reportedly was </p><p>heated (Al-Kitbi said the societies are "fed-up" with </p><p>the ICRC) and the delegates threatened not to </p><p>coordinate with the ICRC in the future, if better </p><p>cooperation is not forthcoming.  Although the ICRC </p><p>finally agreed to ship (or to facilitate shipment) </p><p>humanitarian supplies overland from Kuwait and Syria, </p><p>it did not indicate when such shipments would begin. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>UAE Red Crescent Decides To Act Now </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Although Al-Kitbi was pleased with the </p><p>agreement reached yesterday with the ICRC, she believes </p><p>it will be a number of days (or weeks) before ICRC </p><p>acts.  As an alternate and last resort, the UAE </p><p>Government has requested Embassy assistance to </p><p>coordinate safe passage of a 700-ton shipment of RCA </p><p>humanitarian supplies to Umm Qasr with the HOC.  Al- </p><p>Kitbi noted that the RCA (as a fundamental part of its </p><p>doctrine) does not work with militaries to provide aid, </p><p>but the UAE leadership realizes that coordination with </p><p>Coalition forces is crucial in this case to move and </p><p>distribute the humanitarian supplies in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) She noted that the ICRC is unaware of the </p><p>shipment, and asked that the Embassy refrain from </p><p>notifying the ICRC or the media of RCA plans to travel </p><p>to Umm Qasr later this week.  Al-Kitbi noted that an </p><p>ICRC representative she contacted directly (at the </p><p>suggestion of the HOC) told her that the RCA ship would </p><p>not be allowed to dock in Umm Qasr because of the </p><p>security situation. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Al-Kitbi noted that the Bahraini and Qatari Red </p><p>Crescent Societies likewise are frustrated with the </p><p>ICRC.  They understand that the UAE RCA plans to </p><p>circumvent ICRC channels and send aid directly to Iraq, </p><p>and asked Al-Kitbi yesterday about consolidating </p><p>shipments for the region.  She thought it probable that </p><p>-- if this first shipment to Umm Qasr proves successful </p><p>-- similar requests for additional RCA shipments </p><p>(perhaps including relief supplies from other national </p><p>societies via the UAE RCA) would follow. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
