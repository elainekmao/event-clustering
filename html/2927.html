<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001181 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, PHUM, VM, KN, KS, DPRK </p><p>SUBJECT:  GVN PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO NORTH KOREA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  01 HANOI 2967   B.  HANOI 932 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG\'S VISIT TO </p><p>NORTH KOREA (DPRK) PROVIDED ANOTHER AT LEAST COSMETIC </p><p>INDICATOR OF THE CONTINUING THAW IN BILATERAL RELATIONS. </p><p>WHILE THE TWO COUNTRIES SIGNED A NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS, MOST </p><p>APPEAR TO HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL APPLICATION.  THE </p><p>PROBABILITY OF ANY MAJOR GVN MEDIATION ROLE BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>KOREAS APPEARS LOW.  THE SUBJECT OF NORTH KOREAN DEFECTORS </p><p>ARRIVING IN VIETNAM VIA CHINA REPORTEDLY WAS NOT RAISED WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT LUONG.  CONDITIONS AROUND PYONGYANG APPEARED TO </p><p>SOME IN THE DELEGATION AS MARGINALLY BETTER THAN TWO YEARS </p><p>AGO.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>SEVERAL AGREEMENTS, BUT WHAT DO THEY MEAN? </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  VIETNAM\'S PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG VISITED THE DPRK </p><p>MAY 2-5, WHERE HE MET WITH NATIONAL DEFENSE COMMISSION </p><p>CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-IL AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY PRESIDIUM KIM YONG-NAM.  GVN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN, DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT NGUYEN CANH DINH, AND JUSTICE MINISTER NGUYEN DINH </p><p>LOC TOOK PART IN THE DELEGATION, ALONG WITH MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT LE HUY NGO, CONSTRUCTION </p><p>MINISTER NGUYEN MANH KIEM, AND TRANSPORT MINISTER LE NGOC </p><p>HOAN.  SENIOR DPRK COUNTERPARTS INCLUDED FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>PAEK NAM-SUN AND TRADE MINISTER YI KWANG-KUN. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01181  01 OF 02  130742Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  LUONG\'S VISIT FOLLOWED THE OCTOBER 15-19, 2001 </p><p>GVN/DPRK JOINT ECONOMIC, SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNOLOGY </p><p>COMMITTEE MEETING IN PYONGYANG (REF A), THE FIRST SINCE </p><p>VIETNAM OPENED BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA IN 1992, </p><p>AS WELL AS A SERIES OF HIGH LEVEL VISITS IN 2000 AND 2001. </p><p>THE INCREASED CONTACTS ARE IN LINE WITH VIETNAM\'S GENERAL </p><p>POLICY OVER THE PAST DECADE TO "BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  THE TWO SIDES SIGNED A NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS DURING </p><p>THE VIST, INCLUDING: </p><p> </p><p>--A TREATY ON LEGAL COOPERATION IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES; </p><p> </p><p>--AN AGREEMENT ON THE PREVENTION OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND </p><p>INCOME TAX EVASION; </p><p> </p><p>--AN AGREEMENT ON MARITIME TRANSPORTATION; AND, </p><p> </p><p>--AN AGREEMENT FOR IMPROVING BILATERAL TRADE, INCLUDING </p><p>BARTER TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  LE VAN CU, MFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE ASIA I </p><p>DEPARTMENT (WHO ACCOMPANIED PRESIDENT LUONG TO THE DPRK), </p><p>TOLD POLOFF ON MAY 10 THAT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED DURING THE </p><p>"LANDMARK" VISIT REFLECTED THE "STRONG AND TRADITIONAL" </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  CU ADMITTED THAT THE ECONOMIC </p><p>AGREEMENTS MIGHT NOT HAVE "MUCH VALUE NOW, BUT WILL SERVE AS </p><p>A PATH TO FUTURE COOPERATION."  WHEN PRESSED, CU WAS UNABLE </p><p>TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC BILATERAL TRADE FIGURES, BUT ADMITTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01181  01 OF 02  130742Z </p><p>TWO-WAY TRADE IS "NEGLIGIBLE."  CU NOTED THAT VIETNAM HAD </p><p>ALSO DONATED 5,000 TONS OF RICE TO NORTH KOREA, A "SMALL, </p><p>SYMBOLIC" AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO WHAT VIETNAM HAD DONATED LAST </p><p>YEAR.  CU SAID VIETNAM WOULD LIKE TO DONATE MORE, BUT "WE </p><p>ARE ALSO A POOR COUNTRY."  HE ADMITTED THE DPRK STILL OWES </p><p>USD 10 MILLION TO VIETNAM FOR A 1996 RICE "SALE."  CU SAID </p><p>HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN THE DPRK WOULD REPAY THIS DEBT, DUE TO </p><p>ITS "DESTITUTE" ECONOMIC SITUATION.  HOWEVER, CU CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE "UNDERSTOOD THE HARD SITUATION IN </p><p>THE DPRK" AND ARE "FULLY SYMPATHETIC." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO ONE ROK EMBOFF, THE ECONOMIC </p><p>AGREEMENTS ARE "QUITE MEANINGLESS," SINCE THE DPRK HAS </p><p>"NOTHING TO OFFER VIETNAM."  THE EMBOFF ALSO SAID THE IDEA </p><p>OF "BARTER TRADE" IS "UNREALISTIC" FOR THE SAME REASON.  HE </p><p>DISCOUNTED  REPORTS OF SOME CEMENT AND/OR COAL COMING INTO </p><p>VIETNAM FROM THE DPRK.   HE STRESSED THAT LUONG\'S VISIT, OR </p><p>THE THAWING TREND IN GVN/DPRK RELATIONS IN GENERAL, WOULD </p><p>NOT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON VIETNAM\'S "STRONG" </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH SOUTH KOREA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE GVN MEDIATION ROLE UNLIKELY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  AS NOTED IN REF B, THE GVN HAD INDICATED NEW </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO ACT AS A NORTH-SOUTH MEDIATOR DURING THE ROK </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0121 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01181  02 OF 02  130742Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CA-01    CEA-01 </p><p>      CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  C-00     DOEE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03   OES-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /016W </p><p>                  ------------------AD7BCB  130743Z /38 </p><p>R 130733Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6424 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SEOUL </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI//FPA// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ABLAGG// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 001181 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01181  02 OF 02  130742Z </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S RECENT VISIT; PRESS REPORTS HAD ALSO SPECULATED </p><p>ON SUCH A POTENTIAL ROLE FOR VIETNAM.  THE ROK EMBOFF AND CU </p><p>SEPARATELY DOWNPLAYED THIS LIKELIHOOD, HOWEVER.    ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE EMBOFF, VIETNAM, AS A SOCIALIST COUNTRY, IS "PROBABLY </p><p>NOT SUITABLE" TO BECOME SERIOUSLY INVOLVED IN SUCH AN </p><p>EFFORT, OTHER THAN TO "PASS MESSAGES" BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES. </p><p>THE MFA\'S CU SAID THAT HE VIEWED AN ACTIVE MEDIATION ROLE AS </p><p>"IMPROBABLE."  HOWEVER, HE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT LUONG HAD </p><p>INDEED PASSED A MESSAGE TO HIS HOSTS FROM SOUTH KOREA\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP CONCERNING THE ROK\'S DESIRE FOR "PEACEFUL </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS" ON THE ISSUE OF KOREAN REUNIFICATION, A GOAL </p><p>THAT VIETNAM "FULLY SUPPORTS," CU EMPHASIZED. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>CONCERN OVER DEFECTORS? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  PRESS REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED THE LEGAL </p><p>COOPERATION AGREEMENT MAY HAVE BEEN A REACTION TO AN </p><p>INCREASING NUMBER OF DPRK DEFECTORS COMING THROUGH THE PRC </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO USE VIETNAM AS A TRANSIT POINT TO SOUTH KOREA. </p><p>THE ROK EMBOFF ACKNOWLEDGED THIS INCREASE IS "PROBABLY A </p><p>CONCERN TO THE DPRK," ALTHOUGH HE WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE </p><p>SPECIFIC NUMBERS.  THE MFA\'S CU CLAIMED, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>ISSUE OF POTENTIAL NORTH KOREAN DEFECTORS ENTERING VIETNAM </p><p>DID NOT COME UP DURING LUONG\'S VISIT AND THAT THE GVN DID </p><p>NOT CONSIDER THIS ISSUE IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>UPCOMING VISITS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01181  02 OF 02  130742Z </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  THE MFA\'S CU SAID PRESIDENT LUONG HAD INVITED KIM </p><p>JONG IL TO VISIT VIETNAM, WHILE KIM INVITED COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>OF VIETNAM GENERAL SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH TO VISIT THE </p><p>DPRK.  CU SAID THE RESPECTIVE INVITATIONS WERE ACCEPTED </p><p>"HAPPILY," ALTHOUGH NO DATES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED FOR EITHER </p><p>VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>CONDITIONS MARGINALLY BETTER? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  CU, WHO LIVED IN THE DPRK FOR 12 YEARS AND HAS </p><p>MADE NUMEROUS TRIPS THERE THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, SAID </p><p>CONDITIONS APPEARED "A LITTLE BETTER" SINCE 2001.  THERE </p><p>WERE A FEW MORE LIGHTS BURNING AT NIGHT, COMPARED TO A VISIT </p><p>HE MADE IN 2000 WHEN THE STREETS WERE NEARLY DARK AFTER THE </p><p>SUN SET.  WHILE HE DID NOT HAVE MUCH TIME TO WALK AROUND, HE </p><p>NOTICED A FEW VERY SMALL MARKETS, APPARENTLY NEW.
