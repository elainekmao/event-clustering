<p>UNCLAS ROME  003477 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA SURA JOHNSON </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAGR, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT:  ROME GENEVA GROUP:POST WFS5YL AND TERM LIMITS </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL: ROME 3214 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY. ROME GENEVA GROUP (MAJOR DONORS) MEMBERS </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED WORLD FOOD SUMMIT:FIVE </p><p>YEARS LATER (WFS5YL) AS NEITHER A SUCCESS NOR A FAILURE. </p><p>MEMBERS DISCUSSED WAYS TO REVITALIZE THE WFS5YL FOLLOW-UP </p><p>MECHANISM IN ORDER TO AVOID HOLDING ANOTHER SUMMIT-LEVEL </p><p>MEETING IN 2006 (THE YEAR ORIGINALLY DESIGNATED FOR HOLDING </p><p>THE "MID-TERM REVIEW" OF THE FIRST WORLD FOOD SUMMIT.)  EU </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE GROUP ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD BE STARTING </p><p>CONSULTATIONS ON A TERM LIMIT INITIATIVE SHORTLY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE ROME-BASED GENEVA GROUP MET JUNE 25, 2002 TO REVIEW </p><p>THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED WORLD FOOD SUMMIT: FIVE YEARS LATER </p><p>(WFS5YL) AND DISCUSS OTHER GENEVA GROUP BUSINESS. </p><p> </p><p>WFS5YL POST MORTEM - LIVING UP TO (LOW) EXPECTATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON BALANCE, GENEVA GROUP MEMBERS FELT THAT THE WFS5YL </p><p>WAS "NOT A SUCCESS, BUT NOT A FAILURE."  FRANCE FELT THAT </p><p>PRESS COVERAGE HAD HELPED FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE ISSUE, BUT </p><p>WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE NGO/CSO REACTION TO THE SUMMIT </p><p>(SPECIFICALLY THAT THEY FELT THEY WERE "NOT LISTENED TO.") </p><p>WHILE DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG) DIOUF HAD REPORTEDLY TOLD THE </p><p>NGO FORUM THAT "THE ABSENCE OF OECD LEADERS IS AN INDICATION </p><p>OF THE LEVEL OF PRIORITY THEY ATTACH TO HUNGER," GENEVA </p><p>GROUP MEMBERS AGREED WITH THE U.K. REPRESENTATIVE THAT THIS </p><p>WAS 1) IRRESPONSIBLE AND 2) NOT TRUE.  THE OVERALL LEVEL OF </p><p>ATTENDANCE MATCHED THEIR EXPECTATIONS; AND GENEVA GROUP </p><p>MEMBERS WERE SATISFIED THAT THEIR GOVERNMENTS HAD BEEN </p><p>REPRESENTED AT SUFFICIENTLY SENIOR LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  GERMANY EXPRESSED SATISFACTION THAT THE EVENT DIDN\'T </p><p>"TAKE ANY STEPS BACK." SWEDEN OPINED THAT THE NEW FOCUS ON </p><p>AGRICULTURE AS AN ENGINE OF DEVELOPMENT WAS POSITIVE, BUT </p><p>NOTED HIS COUNTRY\'S DISAPPOINTMENT THAT PARTICIPATION OF </p><p>OTHER UN AGENCIES HAD NOT BEEN AS BROAD AS IT COULD HAVE </p><p>BEEN.  THE BELGIAN AND SWISS REPRESENTATIVES NOTED THAT </p><p>THEIR NATIONAL PRESSES HAD BEEN CRITICAL OF THE SUMMIT FOR </p><p>WASTING MONEY (SWITZERLAND) AND FOR NOT HAVING HIGHER-LEVEL </p><p>OECD REPRESENTATION (BELGIUM).  THE SWISS REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>INFORMED THAT GROUP THAT HE WOULD ASK FOR A FULL ACCOUNTING </p><p>OF WFS5YL COSTS AT THE SEPTEMBER FINANCE COMMITTEE SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE U.K. REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT THE WFS5YL HAD ALL </p><p>ALONG BEEN A "PERSONAL PROJECT" FOR DIOUF: IT HAD BEEN "NON- </p><p>INCLUSIVE" OF MEMBERS AND OF OTHER UN AGENCIES (INCLUDING </p><p>UNDP, THE "SCORE-KEEPER FOR THE MILLENIUM DEVELOPMENT </p><p>GOALS.") HE NOTED IN THIS REGARD THAT THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM </p><p>AND THE INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT HAD </p><p>BEEN DENIED PERMISSION TO HOST EVENTS. THE U.K. </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE CALLED THE WORLD BANK\'S 2002 RURAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY A "MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT FOCUS ON </p><p>AGRICULTURE" AND CONCLUDED THAT AGRICULTURE HAD MOVED UP </p><p>"THE AGENDA" BECAUSE OF THE WORLD BANK AND THE UPCOMING </p><p>WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (WSSD) -- NOT </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE FAO. </p><p></p><p>6.  U.S. DEL GAVE A MORE POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF THE SUMMIT, </p><p>REFLECTING THE FACT THAT THE UNITED STATES CAME TO THE </p><p>WFS5YL WITH NEW INITIATIVES AND A RENEWED FOCUS ON </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND WAS THUS ABLE TO STAGE SUCCESSFUL SIDE- </p><p>EVENTS AND ENGAGE IN PRODUCTIVE BILATERAL MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  GENEVA GROUP MEMBERS EXCHANGED VIEWS ON THE SIDE EVENTS </p><p>(GENERALLY CONSIDERED POORLY ORGANIZED) AND THE ROUNDTABLES </p><p>(GIVEN A "B" GRADE FOR EFFORT).  THE MULTISTAKEHOLDER </p><p>DIALOGUE WAS NOT CONSIDERED PRODUCTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE U.K. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY PRAISED THE U.S. INTERVENTION.  FAO\'S EFFORTS </p><p>ON BEHALF OF AGRICULTURE FOR NEPAD (MUCH OF IT A PLUG FOR </p><p>THE FAO\'S SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY) WERE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED BY THE U.K. AS "OLD-THINKING." </p><p> </p><p>WHITHER THE DIRECTOR GENERAL? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>8.  GENEVA GROUP MEMBERS AGREED THAT THE DG\'S STANDING HAD </p><p>PROBABLY BEEN WEAKENED WITH THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE WFS5YL HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO GENERATE NEW RESOURCES (ALTHOUGH DONORS HAD </p><p>LONG WARNED DIOUF THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE A "PLEDGING </p><p>CONFERENCE.") ON G-77 VIEWS OF THE SUMMIT AS A WHOLE, GENEVA </p><p>GROUP MEMBERS REPORTED THAT THEY HAD HEARD VIEWS RANGING </p><p>FROM "WASTE OF TIME" TO "FIASCO" FROM G-77 COLLEAGUES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  GENEVA GROUP MEMBERS NOTED THAT THE DG\'S USD 100 MILLION </p><p>TRUST FUND SEEMED PRETTY MUCH A MORIBUND ISSUE (THE ONLY </p><p>COUNTRY OTHER THAN ITALY THAT HAS PLEDGED IS NIGERIA) AND </p><p>THAT THE DG IS NOW PUSHING HARD ON CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE </p><p>SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY (SPFS).  THIS SEEMED </p><p>INFELICITOUS TO GENEVA GROUP MEMBERS, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW </p><p>OF THE POOR MARKS THAT THE SPFS EARNED IN A RECENTLY </p><p>CONCLUDED EVOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>WFS5YL DECLARATION -- THE ALLIANCE AGAINST HUNGER -- ROLE OF </p><p>CFS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  GENEVA GROUP MEMBERS AGREED WITH SWEDEN THAT THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS OF THE DECLARATION HAD NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY </p><p>CONFRONTATIONAL. THE U.K. REPRESENTATIVE RECALLED THAT </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAD SHOWN NO INTEREST IN INDICATING </p><p>THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES THEY THEMSELVES SOUGHT TO DEVOTE TO </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND THAT THIS RELUCTANCE HAD FATALLY WEAKENED </p><p>THE G-77\'S EFFORTS TO HAVE THE DONORS COMMIT TO A SPECIFIC </p><p>LEVEL FOR AGRICULTURAL ODA.  THE U.S. NOTED ITS RESERVATION </p><p>ON THE NEGOTIATION OF VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES ON THE RIGHT TO </p><p>FOOD. (COMMENT:  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UNITED STATES, NO </p><p>GENEVA GROUP MEMBERS SPOKE ON OR ALLUDED TO THE RIGHT TO </p><p>FOOD DISCUSSIONS. END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>11. MEMBERS WERE PLEASED THAT THERE WAS NO NEW STRUCTURE OR </p><p>BODY UNDERLYING THE "ALLIANCE AGAINST HUNGER" AND WERE </p><p>SATISFIED WITH THE ALLIANCE\'S FOCUS ON BRINGING IN THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR AND NGO\'S.  THEY AGREED THAT FAO\'S COMMITTEE </p><p>ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY (CFS) NEEDED TO BE STRENGTHENED TO </p><p>FOLLOW UP ON THE WFS5YL. </p><p> </p><p>12.  ITALY LINKED THE NEW ALLIANCE WITH THE OLDER "POLO </p><p>ROMANO" IDEA (WHICH SOUGHT TO LINK INSTITUTIONALLY THE THREE </p><p>ROME AGENCIES DEALING WITH FOOD AND AGRICULTURE).  HE STATED </p><p>THAT THE CFS WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO WORK ON THE "SYNERGY </p><p>BETWEEN THE AGENCIES."  THE U.K. AGREED THAT MORE "OOMPH" </p><p>NEEDED TO BE GIVEN TO THE CFS AND NOTED THAT THE CURRENT CFS </p><p>"DOESN\'T WORK," NOT LEAST OF ALL BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF </p><p>REPORTING (PARTICULARLY FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES) ON THE </p><p>WORLD FOOD SUMMIT PLAN OF ACTION.  THE U.K. NOTED THAT CFS </p><p>HAD A NUMBER BUILT-IN ADVANTAGES: IT WAS OPEN TO ALL UN </p><p>MEMBERS, IT HAD A STANDING BUREAU: IT COULD BE TURNED INTO A </p><p>BODY WHERE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MET ONCE A YEAR TO </p><p>FOCUS GOOD ATTENTION ON THE ISSUES.  EXPANDING THE BUREAU </p><p>WAS DISCUSSED (THE BUREAU DOES NOT HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF </p><p>ALL REGIONAL GROUPS) ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOTED THAT THIS WOULD </p><p>CREATE MORE G-77 POSITIONS THAN OECD POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN 2006 </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>13. MEMBERS RECALLED THAT THE FIRST WORLD FOOD SUMMIT CALLED </p><p>FOR A MID-TERM REVIEW IN 2006.  GENEVA GROUP MEMBERS SPOKE </p><p>WITH CONCERN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DG WOULD CALL </p><p>FOR A "WORLD FOOD SUMMIT: 10 YEARS LATER" TO COMMEMORATE THE </p><p>OCCASION, AND DISCUSSED WAYS TO ENSURE THAT A "REINVIGORATED </p><p>CFS" MIGHT FORESTALL SUCH A POSSIBILITY.  THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>WORKING THROUGH THE CFS BUREAU (FRANCE AND THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>KOREA ARE THE OECD MEMBERS ON THE BUREAU FOR THE NEXT TWO </p><p>YEARS) WAS RAISED, AS WELL AS WORKING THROUGH INFORMAL </p><p>CONTACTS AND REPRESENTATIONAL EVENTS.  THE U.K. NOTED THAT </p><p>PART OF THE CFS REVITALIZATION WOULD INVOLVE KEEPING CLOSE </p><p>CONTACT WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE UN IN NEW YORK WITH </p><p>THE MILLENIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (FAO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>FOOD AVAILABILITY -- A SUB-SECTOR OF POVERTY) SO AS "NOT TO </p><p>FALL INTO ISOLATION." </p><p> </p><p>EU INITIATIVE ON DG TERM LIMITS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE U.K. STATED THAT THE EU WAS EXPECTING CLEARANCE </p><p>SHORTLY IN ORDER TO INITIATE CONSULTATIONS WITH OTHER GROUPS </p><p>ON REINSTATING FAO DIRECTOR GENERAL TERM LIMITS BEFORE THE </p><p>SUMMER HOLIDAYS. U.S. (ACTING PERM REP) AND NEW ZEALAND </p><p>NOTED THAT THIS WAS AN EXISTING GENEVA GROUP ISSUE AND </p><p>REMINDED THE EU REPS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSULTING WITH </p><p>OTHER GROUPS BEFORE DELIVERING A "FAIT ACCOMPLI." THE U.K. </p><p>TOOK NOTE OF THE COMMENTS. HEILEMAN </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
