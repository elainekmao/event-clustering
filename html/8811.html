(U) This is an Action Request, please see para 8. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Summary: The Head of the Americas desk at the Ministry </p><p>of Foreign Affairs requests more information regarding the </p><p>link between the Yemen Al-Aqsa Foundation and Hamas. ROYG </p><p>officials are seeking an alternative charity for donations to </p><p>the Palestinian people, possibly the Arab League\'s al-Quds </p><p>foundation. In a follow up meeting, Pol/Econoff confirmed </p><p>that the Ambassador had already provided information on this </p><p>connection at the highest levels sufficient to justify </p><p>freezing the assets of the Al-Aqsa Foundation. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) In a follow-up meeting on June 9 regarding the USG\'s </p><p>request that the ROYG freeze the assets of the local branch </p><p>of the al-Aqsa Foundation, (Reftel A) Head of the America\'s </p><p>desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Abdul Salam al-Awadhi </p><p>requested more information relating to al-Aqsa Foundation\'s </p><p>support for Hamas.   He stated that evidence in the USG </p><p>nonpaper (Ref B) linking Sheikh al-Muayed, the head of </p><p>al-Aqsa foundation, to al-Qaeda was clear.  However, </p><p>al-Awadhi claimed that the evidence concerning the al-Aqsa </p><p>foundation itself and its connections to Hamas, were not </p><p>explicit enough for the MFA to make a clear decision. </p><p>4. (S) Al-Awadhi said that his office is preparing a report </p><p>for Foreign Minister Qirbi recommending whether or not to </p><p>freeze al-Aqsa Foundation assets. At the same time, ROYG </p><p>officials are also seeking alternative conduits for the </p><p>public to donate money on behalf of the Palestinians (Ref A). </p><p> Al-Awadhi raised the possibility of promoting the Arab </p><p>League backed al-Quds Fund as a possible mechanism for </p><p>charitable donations. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Pol/Econoff pointed out that halting the funding for </p><p>an organization that supports Hamas was particularly </p><p>important in light of Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Mazen\'s </p><p>statements against terror at the Aqaba meetings.  Al-Awadhi </p><p>responded that the ROYG understood this issue, and that they </p><p>did not want to be "more royal than the King"  on the matter </p><p>of positive support for the Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) On June 11, in a subsequent meeting, Pol/Econoff </p><p>confirmed to al-Awadhi that the Ministry had already been </p><p>given all relevant information and that the Embassy believed </p><p>the information was sufficient to justify freezing the assets </p><p>of the Yemen al-Aqsa foundation.  She also explained that the </p><p>Ambassador had given Minister Qirbi copies of the al-Muayed </p><p>indictment, which included information on al-Aqsa\'s </p><p>activities in Yemen.  Al-Awadhi politely disagreed that the </p><p>ROYG had enough information to make such a decision. </p><p>However, he  said that all available information would be </p><p>discussed by an interagency team from the Ministries of </p><p>Interior, Finance and Foreign Affairs, who would decide on </p><p>this matter. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Comment: Al-Awadhi may not have been fully briefed on </p><p>the Ambassador\'s conversations with Foreign Minister Qirbi </p><p>regarding Sheikh al-Muayed and al-Aqsa. Either way, al-Awadhi </p><p>is seeking as much information as possible to support a </p><p>difficult decision for the ROYG. However, his search for more </p><p>facts is postponing a decision on al-Aqsa\'s assets, and this </p><p>may be the desired effect. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Action Request: Please advise Post on the Arab </p><p>League\'s al-Quds Fund, in particular  whether there are </p><p>objections to its possible designation by the ROYG as an </p><p>acceptable conduit for donations from Yemeni citizens to the </p><p>Palestinians. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
