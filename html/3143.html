<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003253 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>IRF/DRL FOR DAVID ABRAHMSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: JO, PGOV, PHUM, SOCI </p><p>SUBJECT: STATUS OF SIHAM QANDAH CHILD CUSTODY CASE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY.  Post has reviewed the case of Jordanian </p><p>widow Siham Qandah and her children.  At issue are the </p><p>custody of the children, their sectarian affiliation and </p><p>their religious upbringing.  Qandah\'s husband converted to </p><p>Islam from Christianity (thus converting the children to </p><p>Islam as a matter of Sharia law) before committing suicide in </p><p>1994.  A Jordanian Sharia court later ruled that custody of </p><p>the children belongs to Qandah\'s Muslim brother.  However, </p><p>the GOJ has not enforced the judgment, and, according to </p><p>activists working on the case, a recent meeting between </p><p>Qandah and a GOJ official left Qandah confident that her </p><p>children will be permitted to remain with her and be raised </p><p>as Christians.  The GOJ has taken some administrative steps </p><p>to implement its obligations under Article 18 of the </p><p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). </p><p> These steps should ease the effect of future such cases. </p><p>Post will continue to monitor this case. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Siham Qandah and Hussam Jibreen had two children, </p><p>Fadi and Rawan, in the late 1980s.  The children were born, </p><p>raised, and registered as Christians.  In 1991, Hussam </p><p>converted to Islam; Fadi and Rawan, as minor children of a </p><p>convert to Islam, then became Muslim under Sharia law. </p><p>Hussam committed suicide in 1994.  In 1995, the Southern </p><p>Irbid Sharia court gave Siham\'s brother -- also a convert to </p><p>Islam -- guardianship of the children.  At the same time, the </p><p>court awarded custody to Siham, but on the condition that the </p><p>children receive an education in Islam.  In 1998, Siham,s </p><p>brother brought a civil court suit seeking custody of the </p><p>children on the grounds that Siham had failed to raise them </p><p>as Muslims.  The court agreed and transferred custody rights </p><p>to Siham,s brother.  Appeals have been exhausted and the </p><p>judgment is now ripe for enforcement.  The children are </p><p>currently aged 12 and 14.  There are no further avenues for </p><p>appeal, and any relevant, subsequent changes in law are </p><p>unlikely to be applied retroactively.  Nonetheless, the GOJ </p><p>has not enforced the ruling. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>SHARIA LAW TRUMPS CIVIL LAW </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Within the sphere of related civil law, there are </p><p>indications that the GOJ is moving toward a more pragmatic </p><p>system of rules to deal with families that have children </p><p>and/or parents of different religions.  The Civil Status and </p><p>Passport Department (CSPD) has altered its internal rules and </p><p>procedures so that the pre-born children of a Christian man </p><p>who converts to Islam retain their status as Christians for </p><p>purpose of civil registration.  Only children born after the </p><p>father converts to Islam are delineated as Muslims for the </p><p>purposes for the CSPD.  According to officials at the </p><p>Ministry of Interior, CSPD,s internal rules are meant to </p><p>embody the spirit of Article 18 of the International Covenant </p><p>on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which encourages </p><p>respect for parental rights to raise children in conformity </p><p>with their religions convictions.  We have learned that the </p><p>provisions of Article 18 may soon be codified more formally </p><p>in the civil law.  However, notwithstanding the positive </p><p>changes in regulation, Jordanian conflict of law rules </p><p>provide that Sharia law trumps conflicting civil law or </p><p>regulations on matters within the province of Sharia law </p><p>(i.e. status of a person as a Muslim or a non-Muslim). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>QANDAH, FRIGHTENED, REACHES OUT TO NGOS, CONGRESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Following the string of court defeats, Qandah </p><p>contacted and appealed to the UK-based NGO Middle East </p><p>Concern (MEC).  Daniel Hoffman, Director of MEC, has been in </p><p>direct contact with the Department and Post regarding </p><p>Qandah\'s situation.  In a March 12, 2002 e-mail, Hoffman </p><p>reported that Qandah was desperate in the face of an expected </p><p>GOJ enforcement of the Sharia judgment.  Hoffman reported </p><p>that Qandah\'s pastor and others would seek to assist her in </p><p>her effort to keep her children.  On May 12, the office of </p><p>Congressman Joseph Pitts contacted PolOff and registered the </p><p>Congressman\'s concern about the case.   In addition, PolOff </p><p>has received inquiries about the case from local AMCITS, who </p><p>may have heard of the case through the local Christian </p><p>community grapevine. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>QANDAH REPORTS MEETING WITH GOJ OFFICIAL, FEARS ALLAYED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  On May 23, Hoffman contacted POLOFF and gave an </p><p>update on the case.  Hoffman stated that Qandah had been in </p><p>contact with him, and that she had recently met with a person </p><p>claiming to be a Jordanian security official.  The official </p><p>told Qandah that he was going to be working with her on this </p><p>case and assured her that nobody was going to take her </p><p>children from her.  Hoffman reported that this meeting lasted </p><p>an hour, and that Qandah was extremely relieved afterwards. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  This case has caught the attention of European NGOs, </p><p>local AMCITs, the local Christian community, and members of </p><p>Congress.  By not enforcing the Sharia court ruling, we </p><p>believe the GOJ is trying to find a way to permit Siham </p><p>Qandah\'s children to stay with her and be raised in their </p><p>mother\'s faith without directly challenging an otherwise </p><p>legal and proper court ruling.  The GOJ is also making </p><p>regulatory reform (it tells us) to strengthen its </p><p>implementation of obligations under Article 18 of the ICCPR. </p><p>We will continue to monitor the situation, but for the </p><p>present, the GOJ seems to have arrived at an equitable </p><p>solution. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
