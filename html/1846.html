<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 134673 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 7/31/11 </p><p>TAGS: CH, PINR, PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: CHINA/TIBET: HU CAN\'T GO HOME AGAIN? </p><p>(01-17, 8/02/01) </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR PATTERSON, TIGHE, NSA FOR MINER, LONDON FOR HALL </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING INR VIEWPOINT WAS WRITTEN BY AN ANALYST IN </p><p>THE OFFICE OF EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC ANALYSIS AND IS </p><p>PROVIDED FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY PAULA CAUSEY, OFFICE DIRECTOR INR/EAP. </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. VICE PRESIDENT HU JINTAO\'S JULY 17-23 </p><p>VISIT TO   TIBET WAS POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR AT LEAST </p><p>THREE REASONS: IT CONFIRMED CURRENT POLICY; IT ASSOCIATED </p><p>HU PERSONALLY WITH THE CURRENT RELATIVELY HARD-LINE </p><p>APPROACH; AND IT DEMONSTRATED HIS HEALTH AND VITALITY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) VICE PRESIDENT HU JINTAO MADE A HIGHLY </p><p>PUBLICIZED TRIP TO TIBET IN MID-JULY TO COMMEMORATE </p><p>THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF TIBET\'S "PEACEFUL LIBERATION," </p><p>WHICH ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE IN MAY.   SOME FOREIGN </p><p>TIBET WATCHERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HIS TRIP WAS </p><p>DELAYED WHILE RENOVATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS </p><p>WERE BEING COMPLETED IN LHASA. WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE </p><p>TO SUGGEST THAT SECURITY CONCERNS MIGHT HAVE DELAYED </p><p>THE TRIP. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE MASSIVE "NATIONAL </p><p>UNITY TRIPOD" WHICH HU UNVEILED MAY NOT HAVE BEEN </p><p>COMPLETED IN TIME, BUT THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION IS </p><p>THAT HIS TRIP WAS TIMED TO REINFORCE THE MESSAGE OF </p><p>THE FOURTH NATIONAL TIBET CONFERENCE IN JUNE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) "PEACEFUL LIBERATION" OR "BLOOD AND TEARS"? </p><p>HU, IN A    VARIETY OF INSPECTION TOURS, MEET-AND- </p><p>GREET OCCASIONS, AND         PHOTO OPS, REITERATED </p><p>BEIJING\'S POLICY LINE ARTICULATED AT THE CONFERENCE, </p><p>WHICH WAS ATTENDED BY ALL SEVEN POLITBURO STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HIS KEYNOTE SPEECH AT THE LARGE- </p><p>SCALE LHASA COMMEMORATIVE RALLY UNDERSCORED TIBET\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVED LIVING STANDARDS. </p><p>IN THIS SPEECH AND IN AN ADDRESS TO OFFICIALS WORKING </p><p>IN TIBET, HU ALSO CALLED FOR STRONG EFFORTS TO </p><p>MAINTAIN STABILITY, SAYING TIBET WAS "A GEOGRAPHIC </p><p>BATTLEFRONT FOR FIGHTING AGAINST [ETHNIC] SEPARATISM." </p><p>HE DENOUNCED EFFORTS BY THE "DALAI CLIQUE" AND OTHER </p><p>"ANTI-CHINA FORCES" TO UNDERMINE STABILITY, A HARD </p><p>LINE DRAWN EVEN MORE CLEARLY BY A PUBLICIZED VISIT TO </p><p>PLA, PEOPLE\'S ARMED POLICE, AND SECURITY POLICE TROOPS </p><p>IN TIBET. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PRC POLICY WAS GRAPHICALLY SHOWN BY THE </p><p>PRESENTATION TO THE PLA GARRISON OF A SILK BANNER WITH </p><p>CONGRATULATORY CHARACTERS WRITTEN BY PRESIDENT JIANG AND </p><p>BY THE UNVEILING OF THE 3.5-TON, 15 METER-TALL "NATIONAL </p><p>UNITY TRIPOD," WHICH ALSO BEARS AN INSCRIPTION BY JIANG. </p><p>AN EXILE SPOKESMAN DENOUNCED THE TRIPOD--WHICH MAY HAVE </p><p>BEEN DESIGNED TO REMIND VIEWERS OF THE "GOLDEN URN" </p><p>WHICH BEIJING INSISTS MUST BE USED TO SELECT HIGH- </p><p>RANKING RELIGIOUS OFFICIALS--AS AN "INSULT TO TIBETANS." </p><p>THE SPOKESMAN DENOUNCED THE 50 YEARS OF CHINESE RULE AS </p><p>A TIME OF "BLOOD AND TEARS" AND SAID THE ANNIVERSARY WAS </p><p>NO CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ET HU, BRUTE? HU\'S REMARKS PLACE HIM FIRMLY AND </p><p>UNEQUIVOCALLY BEHIND THE CENTRAL POLICIES ON TIBET. SOME </p><p>OBSERVERS HOLD OUT HOPE THAT HU MIGHT HAVE MORE LIBERAL </p><p>LEANINGS ON TIBETAN POLICY, HOPES FUELED BOTH BY HIS </p><p>POPULIST APPROACH AS PARTY CHIEF OF POVERTY-STRICKEN </p><p>GUIZHOU IN THE MID-1980S AND BY IMPRESSIONS HE CREATED </p><p>BEFORE BEING ASSIGNED AS PARTY CHIEF IN TIBET IN 1988 AT </p><p>THE HEIGHT OF ETHNIC UNREST IN THE REGION. SOME ALSO SAW </p><p>IN HU\'S LONG ABSENCES FROM TIBET DURING HIS TENURE AS </p><p>PARTY CHIEF A SIGN THAT HE WAS NOT FULLY BEHIND THE HARD- </p><p>LINE CRACKDOWN UNDERWAY AT THE TIME. HU MAY, IN FACT, </p><p>HARBOR MORE LIBERAL LEANINGS, BUT HE GAVE NO HINT OF ANY </p><p>DAYLIGHT BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHER CENTRAL LEADERS DURING </p><p>THIS TRIP. TO DO SO, OF COURSE, WOULD ONLY SERVE TO </p><p>UNDERCUT HIS CHANCES IN THE PARTY LEADERSHIP RESHUFFLE </p><p>COMING IN THE FALL OF 2002. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) I\'M FINE, REALLY... HU\'S RETURN TO TIBET FOR A </p><p>GRUELING WEEK-LONG VISIT MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN INTENDED TO </p><p>SHOW THAT HIS HEALTH IS ROBUST. HIS LENGTHY ABSENCES </p><p>FROM TIBET DURING HIS TENURE AS PARTY SECRETARY WERE </p><p>WIDELY BLAMED ON AN INABILITY TO ACCLIMATIZE TO THE HIGH </p><p>ALTITUDE AND RIGOROUS LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE REGION. </p><p>BY NOT ONLY RETURNING TO LHASA, BUT TRAVELING TO </p><p>SHIGATSE AND MAKING NUMEROUS INSPECTION VISITS, THE 59- </p><p>YEAR-OLD HU PROBABLY HOPED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NO </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT HIS HEALTH SHOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS </p><p>SUCCEEDING JIANG AS PARTY CHIEF AND/OR PRESIDENT. </p><p></p><p>(CCLARKE)(CONFIDENTIAL) </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
