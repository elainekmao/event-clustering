<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004256 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR NOVELLI/SAUMS </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - ABBIE DEMOPULOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, BEXP, JO, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: BILATERAL TRADE AGENDA WITH JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  AMMAN 3830 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFID </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Ambassador Gnehm called on Trade Minister </p><p>Salah al-Bashir July 1 to keep up the momentum on </p><p>bilateral trade issues discussed with AUSTR Cathy Novelli </p><p>during the recent World Economic Forum meetings in Jordan </p><p>(ref).  Bashir also mentioned follow-up on Jordan-Israel- </p><p>Palestine and Jordan-Iraq issues he had discussed with </p><p>Commerce U/S Aldonas and CPA economic adviser Reuben </p><p>Jeffery.  Also attending the meeting were Ministry </p><p>Director General Amer al-Hadidi, assistant Rami Qussous, </p><p>and the Jordanian commercial counselor in Washington, </p><p>Maher Matalka, as well as Econ/C Tom Goldberger. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Accelerated FTA tariff Reductions. </p><p> </p><p>Bashir said he would provide a prioritized list of </p><p>requests by July 8.  He said the request would focus on </p><p>textile products and that Jordan would have no problem </p><p>providing symmetrical reductions in its textile tariffs. </p><p>Bashir added that he was considering asking for </p><p>accelerated reductions other product categories and that </p><p>he would clear the entire request with Finance Minister </p><p>Marto.  PLEASE ADVISE -- Bashir asked how the </p><p>accelerations would be implemented on the U.S. side -- is </p><p>legislation required? </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Bilateral Government Procurement Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>Bashir said he would seek the Cabinet\'s approval to make </p><p>the same offer to the United States that Jordan had </p><p>submitted in the WTO GPA process.  He was worried, </p><p>however, that Jordan could be led to make concessions in </p><p>bilateral negotiations with the U.S. that he would </p><p>subsequently be obliged to offer to others in the WTO </p><p>process.  PLEASE ADVISE -- Bashir asked if procurement in </p><p>Jordan using U.S. Foreign Military Assistance (FMF) funds </p><p>would be possible after conclusion of a GPA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  FTA Joint Commission Meeting. </p><p> </p><p>As discussed in Washington last December, Bashir would </p><p>like to hold the second JTC meeting in Jordan this fall. </p><p>Commercial Counselor Matalka will approach USTR to try to </p><p>find a mutually convenient time (Ramadan and the </p><p>subsequent Eid will run from approximately from October </p><p>25 through the end of November).  Bashir would like </p><p>Ambassador Zoellick to participate.  If it were useful, </p><p>he is ready to invite senior technical level officials </p><p>from other Arab countries to Amman for follow-up MEFTA </p><p>discussions with USTR.  He also plans to build an </p><p>investment event in Jordan around the FTA meeting. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Jordan-Israel-Palestine Issues. </p><p> </p><p>Bashir added that he had discussed a possible trilateral </p><p>Jordanian-Israeli-Palestinian trade event in the United </p><p>States with Commerce Under Secretary Aldonas.  He said </p><p>that Israeli trade minister Olmert had supported the idea </p><p>in Bashir\'s bilateral meeting with Olmert.  Also as </p><p>discussed with U/S Aldonas, Bashir will work to get </p><p>Israeli approval to expedite trade through the northern </p><p>border crossing (Shaikh Hussain) using advanced x-ray </p><p>equipment on the Jordanian side.  Bashir hoped Secretary </p><p>Evans would be able to attend the AmCham-sponsored AJEX </p><p>(American Jordanian Exposition) conference that will be </p><p>held in Amman October 22-23. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Jordan-Iraq Issues. </p><p> </p><p>Bashir said that he had also promised Aldonas a paper on </p><p>the advantages Jordan offers for trade with Iraq. </p><p>Following up on a separate meeting with CPA economic </p><p>advisor Reuben Jeffery during the WEF, Bashir said he </p><p>would be providing shortly a GOJ-approved "non-paper" </p><p>describing outstanding bilateral issues with Iraq, </p><p>including the status of the Iraq-Jordan goods for oil </p><p>barter protocols, as well as Jordan\'s potential </p><p>contribution to rebuilding the Iraqi government and </p><p>economy.  He thought this paper could serve as an agenda </p><p>for a bilateral meeting with CPA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Moving forward on the above items -- along with the </p><p>planned Joint Environmental Forum that should take place </p><p>later this year -- basically constitutes our bilateral </p><p>trade agenda with Jordan through the end of the year. </p><p>Washington should be aware that between now and the end </p><p>of the year there could well be a change in government </p><p>following the recent Parliamentary elections.  While this </p><p>could mean some senior personnel changes, we believe that </p><p>any government will see pursuing these initiatives as in </p><p>its interest.  Nonetheless, it will be important that we </p><p>work closely with the Jordanians to maintain the energy </p><p>and momentum injected by the WEF meetings.  The Embassy </p><p>appreciates the engagement of USTR, Commerce, State and </p><p>other Washington agencies in building this model </p><p>relationship in the region. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
