<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000050 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND PA </p><p>STATE ALSO PLEASE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>USAID FOR ANE/AA GORDON WEST AND JIM BEVER </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL/DAUFHAUSER AND DAS JZARATE </p><p>TREASURY ALSO FOR OFAC/RNEWCOMB AND TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST </p><p>FINANCING </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL/DLAUFMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PHUM, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MAOISTS KIDNAP CHILDREN FOR MILITARY </p><p>TRAINING </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 KATHMANDU 2307 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Robert K. Boggs, for reasons b,d </p><p>. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary and Action Request:  Several GON sources </p><p>confirmed to the Embassy on January 8 that more than 200 </p><p>students from four districts in Nepal\'s far-western region </p><p>have been abducted from their schools by Maoist insurgents </p><p>over the past two weeks.  Some of the children have been </p><p>returned to their homes on the condition that they be readily </p><p>available to join the Maoists if needed, and security sources </p><p>speculate that some of the children may have been given </p><p>military training by their captors before being released. </p><p>Suggested press guidance on this issue follows in para 6. </p><p>Action request for USUN is in para 7. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The National Intelligence Directorate (NID) confirmed </p><p>to the Embassy on January 8 that 162 students were abducted </p><p>from various schools in western Bajura and Kailali districts </p><p>over the past two weeks. The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) reported </p><p>an additional 50 students kidnapped in neighboring Doti </p><p>district, and an ex-MP from Gulmi district related reports of </p><p>seventeen students abducted in his former constituency over </p><p>the same timeframe.  The NID stated that all of the kidnapped </p><p>students were in grades 8, 9 and 10, and according to RNA </p><p>sources, the students either were abducted directly from </p><p>their classes or picked up while on their way to school. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to news reports about the incidents, </p><p>confirmed by the NID, many of the kidnapped students have </p><p>been returned to their families after brief periods of </p><p>captivity.  Security sources speculate that the children may </p><p>have been given some military instruction by their captors in </p><p>preparation for active duty with the insurgents, a suspicion </p><p>supported by GON intelligence reports stating that the </p><p>children were released on the condition that they be readily </p><p>available to re-join the Maoists if needed.  Students and </p><p>local residents who spoke to the media on condition of </p><p>anonymity stated that the children were exposed to a </p><p>"political training program" before being released, and were </p><p>threatened with physical violence and torture if they </p><p>revealed the location of the Maoist camp or the purpose of </p><p>the "meeting." </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Officials at the District Headquarters of Doti and </p><p>Kailali could not confirm or deny the reports, responding to </p><p>Embassy queries by saying that they had "no official </p><p>information" about the kidnappings.  However, when pressed to </p><p>answer "unofficially," officers in both districts stated that </p><p>they were aware that a number of children had been kidnapped, </p><p>but could not confirm how many were still in Maoist custody. </p><p>Citing numbers considerably higher than official reports, the </p><p>acting Chief District Officer in Doti suggested that the </p><p>number of children abducted in his district could be as high </p><p>as 250. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment:  Post agrees with speculation by the </p><p>security forces that the current abductions are for the </p><p>purpose of indoctrination and training, and the incidents, </p><p>combined with prior reports that Maoists have forced families </p><p>to pay a bounty or give up one child to their forces (ref), </p><p>are further evidence of the moral hypocrisy and bankruptcy of </p><p>Nepal\'s so-called "people\'s war."  Maoists in Nepal\'s western </p><p>districts have forced a number of schools to close until the </p><p>militants can provide revolutionary teaching materials.  In </p><p>the continuing absence of revised curricula, the Maoists </p><p>appear to be resorting to forced indoctrination.  The </p><p>kidnapping may be a response also to the reported </p><p>difficulties the Maoists are encountering in recruitment, as </p><p>increasing numbers of young people flee Maoist-infested </p><p>areas. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) FIRST ACTION REQUEST:  Post suggests that PA consider </p><p>releasing a statement condemning the abduction and forced </p><p>conscription of minors by the Maoists.  Suggested press </p><p>guidance follows: </p><p> </p><p>(Begin text) </p><p>Recent reports indicate that Maoist insurgents have abducted </p><p>more than 150 children from their schools in western Nepal </p><p>over the past two weeks, apparently in an effort to conscript </p><p>the students into their ranks.  The United States condemns in </p><p>the strongest possible terms the abduction and forced </p><p>conscription of children for use in an armed conflict, and </p><p>calls on the Maoists to cease this inhumane activity. </p><p> </p><p>(End text) </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) SECOND ACTION REQUEST:  The use of child soldiers by </p><p>Nepal\'s insurgents has been cited in the Third Report of the </p><p>Secretary-General of the United Nations on the Use of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Children in Armed Conflict as a "situation of concern."  Post </p><p>urges US representatives to speak out strongly against the </p><p>continued forced recruitment of minors by Nepal\'s Maoists </p><p>when the report is reviewed by the Security Council. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
