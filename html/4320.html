The plan demands that the two sides on the island </p><p>conclude negotiations by February 28, 2003, and that the </p><p>agreement be taken to referendum on March 30, 2003.  Papers </p><p>report that Secretary Powell has found the first reaction </p><p>from the two Cypriot communities encouraging.  Reports also </p><p>note that if the plan is accepted, the land controlled by </p><p>Turkish Cypriots will be reduced from 36 to 28.5 percent, </p><p>and about 42,000 Turks will be displaced.  According to the </p><p>plan, Varosha, Morphou and 20 villages will be given to </p><p>Greek Cypriots within three years.  85,000 displaced Greek </p><p>Cypriots will be given the right to return their homes in </p><p>the north, and 114,000 Turks who were settled in Cyprus </p><p>after 1974 will be given nationality rights.  Papers report </p><p>that TGS Chief General Ozkok is due in Cyprus on Thursday to </p><p>attend the 19th anniversary celebrations of the TRNC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU: Papers report that German Chancellor Schroeder has found </p><p>initial AKP statements on European affairs as promising, and </p><p>he called for sustained reforms under the new Turkish </p><p>government.  "Radikal" notes the reforms AKP leader Erdogan </p><p>had promised to EU envoys in Ankara, adding that rapid </p><p>parliamentary approval would earn Turkey a date for </p><p>accession negotiations at the Copenhagen Summit.  All papers </p><p>give front-page coverage to Erdogan\'s Rome visit, and his </p><p>meeting with Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi, during which </p><p>Berlusconi promised to support Turkey\'s EU bid at the </p><p>Copenhagen Summit.  Following a November 18 visit to Greece, </p><p>Erdogan will tour Spain, England, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, </p><p>Sweden, and France before the end of  November. </p><p>Erdogan: Erdogan reportedly said that AKP would not press to </p><p>change Article 109 of the Constitution that regulates the </p><p>appointment of a Prime Minister, and added that he would not </p><p>become deputy Prime Minister, but instead will wait for </p><p>removal of his ban.  AKP seeks the support of CHP for </p><p>constitutional reforms that would abolish political bans. </p><p>According to papers, the CHP condition for such cooperation </p><p>will be AKP support to reduce the time between regular </p><p>elections from years to four.  This would prevent AKP  from </p><p>using its current parliamentary majority to elect a new </p><p>President in 2007.  Papers report that AKP deputy chairman </p><p>Abdullah Gul was given the task of restructuring the cabinet </p><p>with 23 ministers, including a Prime Minister with three </p><p>deputies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Having finished meetings in Ankara on Wednesday, the </p><p>CIA delegation headed by Deputy CIA Director McLaughlin will </p><p>proceed to Northern Iraq after stopping at Incirlik Airbase, </p><p>reports say.  Papers report that MFA has launched an </p><p>investigation regarding Iraqi efforts to purchase atropine </p><p>from Turkey.  The Northern Iraqi Patriotic Union of </p><p>Kurdistan (PUK) leader Talabani said on Wednesday on the all- </p><p>news channel NTV that the Iraqi regime established after </p><p>Saddam will be friendly to Turkey.  Talabani pledged </p><p>guarantees for Turkomens, said they would be offered 10 </p><p>seats in the parliament, and added that the Kurds\' </p><p>provisional constitution could be modified according to </p><p>Ankara\'s demands.  He noted that the U.S. had made no </p><p>demands from the Kurds, and said he was unaware of the </p><p>presence of CIA operatives in Northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a)  NATO Summit </p><p>b)  UN Plan on Cyprus </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Upcoming Prague Summit" </p><p>Fikret Ertan wrote in Islamic-intellectual Zaman (11/14): </p><p>"The NATO summit in Prague will be a breakthrough both in </p><p>terms of the future of NATO and for the future of NATO- </p><p>Europe relations.  . The official agenda consists of new </p><p>threats, expansion, new relations, new military capabilities </p><p>and the Balkans.  This by itself makes the summit a very </p><p>important one.  . The EU plan for a European Army and the US </p><p>plan for a rapid reaction force within the NATO structure </p><p>are the two hot topics at the summit.  The debate will most </p><p>likely be concentrated on these issues, both of which are </p><p>immediate concerns for Turkey." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The UN plan is a death verdict for the TRNC" </p><p>Columnist Hasan Unal argued in Islamic-intellectual Zaman </p><p>(11/14): "The UN plan aims to liquidate the Turkish Republic </p><p>of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a state and the Turkish </p><p>Cypriots as a nation. . It might give the impression that it </p><p>meets Turkish demands on constitutional issues, but in fact </p><p>it provides an opportunity for founding a unitary Greek </p><p>Cypriot state. . The plan also gives very limited, poor- </p><p>quality land to the Turkish Cypriots.  . In short, the UN </p><p>plan expects Turkish Cypriots to make vital concessions </p><p>without meeting their ultimate demands. Cyprus will </p><p>gradually become a Greek Cypriot island.  It is clear that </p><p>security issues and guarantees, of which Turkey is part, </p><p>will not be valid the moment Cyprus joins the EU." </p><p>"Cyprus" </p><p>Hadi Uluengin calls the UN plan a historic chance in mass </p><p>appeal Hurriyet (11/14): "Clearly this is a unique chance </p><p>for a Cyprus settlement and one definitely not to be missed. </p><p>Creating excuses or making evasive remarks in order not to </p><p>take advantage of  this chance would be a crucial mistake. </p><p>Whichever side blocks this agreement will be judge harshly </p><p>by history for its mistake. . The Annan plan is almost </p><p>perfect.  Therefore, if one of the concerned parties rejects </p><p>the plan and leads to the continuation of a no-settlement </p><p>situation, it will be doomed to miss the opportunities </p><p>coming with the new millennium." </p><p></p></div>
