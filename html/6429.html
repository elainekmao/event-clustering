<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000655 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR CA/OCS/EMR FOR DGOODING, EAP/BCLTV FOR CJESS, EAP/EX </p><p>FOR LBAER, JJENKINS, MED/EX FOR KHODAI, RMO/BKK FOR JKEYES, </p><p>OES/IHA, WHA/BSC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, AMED, TBIO, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  SARS IN HANOI: CURRENT SITUATION AND REQUEST FOR </p><p>GUIDANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HANOI 590 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Please see action/guidance requests in paras 9 and 10. </p><p> </p><p>What Happened? </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Hanoi is one of the areas most affected in the current, </p><p>worldwide epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). </p><p>The first Hanoi case was identified February 26th, when an </p><p>American citizen (Hanoi\'s "index patient") developed flu-like </p><p>symptoms when traveling from Shanghai, China to Hanoi, Vietnam </p><p>via Hong Kong.  On February 28th, he was admitted at the Hanoi </p><p>French Hospital with fever, myalgia, and shortness of breath and </p><p>was diagnosed with atypical pneumonia.  His condition </p><p>deteriorated quickly, and on March 4th, he was medically </p><p>evacuated to Hong Kong and admitted to the Princess Margaret </p><p>Hospital, where he died on March 13.  Following his evacuation, </p><p>22 health care workers (WHO report) developed similar flu -like </p><p>symptoms and were admitted to the Hanoi French Hospital.  That </p><p>hospital was closed to the public on March 8th, thus removing the </p><p>only hospital with international level standards of health care </p><p>and infection control practices.  An additional wave of health </p><p>care workers and close family members has been admitted to the </p><p>National Institute of Clinical Research on Tropical Medicine </p><p>(NICRTM) at Bach Mai (the national hospital).  According to the </p><p>CDC Vietnam office, which works closely with the NICRTM on </p><p>HIV/AIDS care and treatment, infection control practices at this </p><p>institute are minimal. </p><p> </p><p>Current Situation </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  WHO reports more than 40 cases in Hanoi, all with a direct </p><p>link to either the index patient or health care workers who </p><p>cared for him.  Thus far, all cases appear related to very close </p><p>contact with an affected person. Officially, one additional </p><p>person has died, a nurse from the Hanoi French Hospital, and </p><p>several health care workers reportedly remain in critical </p><p>condition requiring mechanical ventilation. </p><p> </p><p>What is it? </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Thus far, the agent causing the syndrome has not been </p><p>identified.  According to CDC, the agent does not appear to be </p><p>related to initial suspected pathogens such as the Hong Kong </p><p>Avian influenza (H5N1), pneumonic plague, Hantavirus, or </p><p>chlamydia.  However, the Hong Kong cases and the Hanoi index </p><p>case may be related to a longer term epidemic of atypical </p><p>pneumonia in southern China (Guangdong province).  WHO and CDC </p><p>advisories suggest that transmission is consistent with direct </p><p>contact with respiratory secretions of an infected patient.  The </p><p>incubation period (time from exposure to first symptom onset) </p><p>appears to be about 3 to 5 days in most affected patients, but </p><p>may be as long as 7 to 10 days.  Initial symptoms are non- </p><p>specific, and include high fever, muscle aches, and in some </p><p>cases sore throat and dry cough.  Over time, many affected </p><p>patients develop the typical diffuse, bilateral pneumonia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>International Help </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Vietnam Ministry of Health has taken a lead in the </p><p>epidemic investigation and has requested support from WHO </p><p>(taking lead in coordinating international assistance), with </p><p>additional technical support from CDC Atlanta (4 staff) and the </p><p>CDC Vietnam Office.  Additional international experts from </p><p>France, Australia, and Japan are now arriving in country.  As a </p><p>result, WHO\'s coordination of the international response has </p><p>been challenging. </p><p> </p><p>GVN Reaction </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  The GVN was initially slow to provide widespread information </p><p>or recommendations on precautionary measures, and may even have </p><p>provided inappropriate recommendations.  However, later response </p><p>has been appropriate.  An early response by GVN appeared to be </p><p>an attempt to minimize publicity on the severity of the problem. </p><p>Reality now has set in.  With international support, the GVN </p><p>supported the isolation and closure of the Hanoi French Hospital </p><p>and an attempt to prevent spread of the disease into the general </p><p>community.  A unit of NICRTM at Bach Mai hospital has been set </p><p>aside to quarantine patients.  Health officials carefully </p><p>monitor exposed individuals for signs of infection and conduct </p><p>contact tracing.  Vietnam Airlines and other airlines are </p><p>currently screening passengers and have reportedly refused </p><p>boarding to individuals exhibiting symptoms.  In the past few </p><p>days, Vietnamese television has begun to publicize preventative </p><p>measures.  On March 16, the GVN Ministry of Health (MOH) held an </p><p>urgent meeting, which included several foreign experts in </p><p>outbreak investigations and control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reaction of other Embassies </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  The reactions of Embassies in Hanoi have been diverse.  Many </p><p>Embassies are simply sharing the WHO press release with </p><p>travelers to Vietnam.  At the opposite extreme, the Czech </p><p>Embassy has closed its consular operations and is advising its </p><p>citizens not to be in a closed space with large numbers of </p><p>Vietnamese nationals.  According to and EU Embassy here, the </p><p>French Ministry of Health has reportedly acknowledged that WHO </p><p>has not issued a travel advisory warning against travel to </p><p>affected areas, but has nonetheless issued a travel advisory of </p><p>its own warning against non-essential travel.  The French </p><p>Embassy reportedly is also issuing daily warden messages.  Our </p><p>Embassy and ConGen have issued two warden messages - one last </p><p>Wednesday, advising of the closure of the Hanoi French Hospital, </p><p>and one last Friday, recommending precautionary measures to </p><p>avoid exposure.  In addition, Hanoi has held "town-hall </p><p>meetings" with the Embassy community to minimize panic and </p><p>disseminate accurate information. </p><p> </p><p>8. ConGen Ho Chi Minh City reports that the consular corps there </p><p>has been advised that the Tropical Disease Hospital has been </p><p>designated as the primary receiving hospital for any potential </p><p>SARS cases.  As of this writing, there are no confirmed SARS </p><p>cases in HCMC, although local news reports refer to two possible </p><p>cases.  The CDC Vietnam Office reports that infection control </p><p>practices in Vietnam hospitals are minimal, and the likelihood </p><p>of spread of the syndrome into the general community is fairly </p><p>high.  The head of an international clinic with long experience </p><p>in Vietnam has informally told us he expects the crucial point </p><p>for HCMC to be later this week - probably Wednesday and after. </p><p>ConGen will hold a mini-town hall meeting via digital </p><p>videoconference tomorrow afternoon with resident Hanoi CDC </p><p>medical personnel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Requests </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Post strongly recommends that a travel advisory be issued </p><p>immediately for Hanoi recommending against non-essential travel </p><p>to Hanoi for the reasons outlined below. This travel advisory </p><p>could be short term in nature, until it is clear that the </p><p>outbreak of this potentially fatal syndrome is controlled.  The </p><p>need for the continuation of the travel advisory would be re- </p><p>assessed on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> </p><p>-- First, even before the outbreak, medical care in Vietnam is </p><p>limited compared with many neighboring posts.  (Bangkok and </p><p>Singapore are where we medevac people.)  With the closure of the </p><p>Hanoi French Hospital and limited availability for medevac to </p><p>Hong Kong (already over-extended), Singapore or Bangkok (both </p><p>now refusing presumed SARS patients), few international level </p><p>facilities are available in the region for new Hanoi SARS cases, </p><p>and no international facilities exist in Hanoi for any medical </p><p>emergency requiring hospitalization.   Even out-patient care is </p><p>limited: the SOS Clinic receives only patients who have called </p><p>ahead and been screened; the Hanoi Family Practice is screening </p><p>patients at the door but, reportedly, is now referring patients </p><p>suspected of SARS to Bach Mai hospital.  In essence, limited </p><p>options exist for medical care of serious illnesses, and even </p><p>non-serious conditions carry elevated risk (as people may be </p><p>exposed to SARS while awaiting care). </p><p> </p><p>-- Secondly, tourists from southern China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and </p><p>many other countries continue to stream into Vietnam via both </p><p>northern and southern points of entry.  Given that SARS has </p><p>already spread outside of the medical community in Hong Kong and </p><p>southern China, it is highly probable that SARS will spread in </p><p>Vietnam and lead to additional risk of exposure for travelers. </p><p>Furthermore, because of the lack of availability of adequate </p><p>medical care in Hanoi, some exposed patients have attempted to </p><p>fly out of Vietnam to seek medical care elsewhere, thus exposing </p><p>other passengers.  This practice clearly must be stopped as this </p><p>leads to further spread of the epidemic and threat to other </p><p>regions of the world. </p><p> </p><p>-- Finally, medical evacuation is difficult and expensive even </p><p>on a limited basis.  If a more widespread epidemic occurs in </p><p>Hanoi, evacuation will become unfeasible.  Medevac of official </p><p>Americans will be equally difficult. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Lastly, Mission wishes to draw the Department\'s attention </p><p>to the many TDY and PCS travelers that have been long scheduled </p><p>to arrive and depart Vietnam over the next few days and weeks. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
