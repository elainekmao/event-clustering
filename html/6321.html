<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000429 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/OMC DAVID HOGAN </p><p>KATHMANDU FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HUB </p><p> </p><p>E.O 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIS, SENV, ETRD, CE </p><p>SUBJECT: 2003 SHRIMP/TURTLE CERTIFICATIONS UNDER </p><p>SECTION 609 of P.L 101-162 - SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 54094 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  This cable responds to reftel request </p><p>regarding Sri Lanka\'s sea turtle conservation program, </p><p>and is based on information from the Ministry of </p><p>Fisheries and Ocean Resources (MOFOR).  According to </p><p>the MOFOR submission, Sri Lanka\'s fishing industry </p><p>continues to use fishing methods that do not harm sea </p><p>turtles.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Wild harvested shrimp fishery </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  Sri Lanka\'s shrimp trawling grounds are located in </p><p>the North, Northeast and Northwest.  The Government of </p><p>Sri Lanka (GSL) has not issued any licenses for </p><p>mechanized trawling in these areas.  MOFOR states that </p><p>in the event mechanized shrimp trawling is allowed, </p><p>Government will impose regulations requiring use of </p><p>turtle excluder devices (TEDS) in mechanized trawlers. </p><p> </p><p>3.  There are three types of shrimp fisheries in Sri </p><p>Lanka.  One uses small trawls that do not have otter </p><p>doors.  The boats used in this fishery are non- </p><p>mechanized and propelled by sails.  They trawl within </p><p>about one mile from shore, where the depth of the sea </p><p>is less than 12 meters.  Four fishermen go in each </p><p>boat, and the trawl is towed manually.  Presently, </p><p>over 150 boats are engaged in this type of fishery, </p><p>which is practiced mostly in Negombo, in the western </p><p>part of the country. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The second fishery uses trawls using 3.5 ton, 9- </p><p>meter boats powered by 30-horsepower (HP) inboard </p><p>engines.  The trawl is towed manually, usually by four </p><p>to five fishermen.  The time taken to haul the trawl </p><p>is less than one hour.  Presently there are about 60 </p><p>such boats.  This fishery is practiced in Wattala and </p><p>Kalpitiya, in the western coastal belt. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The third fishery type uses cast netting (throw </p><p>netting) in lagoons.  In this type of fishery, usually </p><p>two fishermen go in small boats powered with an out- </p><p>board motor and throw a cone-shaped net that has </p><p>circular sinkers at the bottom and a cord connected to </p><p>the apex.  The net surrounds the fish and shrimp, and </p><p>sinks to the bottom, and is retrieved by pulling the </p><p>cord.  Due to the weight of the sinkers, the mouth of </p><p>the net keeps closed and therefore the fish and shrimp </p><p>inside cannot escape.  Mostly subsistence or part-time </p><p>fishermen practice this fishery. </p><p> </p><p>6.  According to the MOFOR, none of the above </p><p>fisheries are harmful to sea turtles.  In 2002, the </p><p>total shrimp catch was estimate at 5,500 tons.  Over </p><p>70 percent of it came from aquaculture. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Sea turtle protection program </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  GSL continues to conserve sea turtles.  Sea </p><p>turtles are protected under provisions of the Fauna </p><p>and Flora Protection Ordinance. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The above information describing Sri Lanka\'s wild </p><p>harvested shrimp fishery methods was received at </p><p>embassy Colombo from MOFAR, and dated March 12, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
