<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001145 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND SCHLACHTER, </p><p>AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ON MUGABE\'S VISIT TO THE UN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "One trip to New York won\'t change </p><p>   much" </p><p>   the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated its </p><p>   May 14 editorial to President Mugabe\'s May 8-11 </p><p>   Trip to UN headquarters in New York. Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "President Mugabe ignored the crisis in his own </p><p>   country </p><p>   and flew to the UN in New York just to cock a snook at </p><p>   his domestic and international detractors. . .  It would </p><p>   seem that massaging his own political ego is much more </p><p>   vital to the President than the prospect of facing head- </p><p>   on the problems his government has created for the last </p><p>   22 years.  The conference on children at the UN was </p><p>   important in its own way, but not for a head of state </p><p>   whose country has not recovered from the political fall- </p><p>   out of an election condemned as woefully flawed by </p><p>   everybody not particularly starry-eyed about the false </p><p>   glory of \'regaining our heritage\' - the violence-riddled </p><p>   land reform program. . ." </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
