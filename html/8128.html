UNICEF recently released a policy paper recommending </p><p>that infant formula be immediately deleted from the OFF </p><p>general ration.  The following report summarizes information </p><p>gathered by the DART from WFP local female staff, home </p><p>interviews, and IDP interviews in Basrah Governorate between </p><p>4 and 11 May.  Although a more thorough investigation of the </p><p>use of infant formula is necessary in Basrah and other Iraqi </p><p>governorates, the issues raised during interviews indicate </p><p>to the DART that the risks involved in removing this </p><p>commodity from the OFF general food ration for children </p><p>under one year of age cannot be justified prior to the </p><p>establishment of a functioning maternal and child safety net </p><p>and health education program.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>USE OF INFANT FORMULA </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Basrah is Iraq\'s second largest city, with an estimated </p><p>population of 1.2 million people.  The population of Basrah </p><p>governorate is estimated at 1.8 million.  Although overall </p><p>rates of exclusive breastfeeding in Iraq increased during </p><p>the sanctions period (from 17 percent to 30 percent), </p><p>interviews of U.N. World Food Program (WFP) local staff who </p><p>have sampled Basrah\'s urban and rural populations indicate </p><p>that there is significant variance in the rates of </p><p>breastfeeding between rural and urban and uneducated versus </p><p>educated women.  WFP indicates that there is almost </p><p>universal breastfeeding in rural areas of Basrah </p><p>governorate, while in the city more than 75 percent of women </p><p>bottle-feed for at least a portion of an infant\'s first </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>3.  According to WFP, bottle-feeding is particularly common </p><p>to women working outside the home, even though most women </p><p>are provided six months to a year of maternity leave after </p><p>giving birth.  Bottle-feeding among working and educated </p><p>women appears to be largely a matter of preference. </p><p> </p><p>4.  In interviews with poorer women, and with internally </p><p>displaced persons (IDPs) in Al Zubayr, bottle-feeding was </p><p>linked to a mother\'s perception that her own milk supply was </p><p>insufficient.  Among the seven IDP families interviewed by </p><p>the DART, three reported using infant formula (IF) because </p><p>their own milk was insufficient, with two of these estimated </p><p>that they did not eat enough to be able to produce milk.  A </p><p>fourth indicated that she was on medication, and was worried </p><p>that the drug would pass to her baby if she tried to nurse. </p><p> </p><p>5.  All women indicated that they used either bottled or </p><p>boiled water to prepare IF, and in the absence of </p><p>refrigeration, discarded any milk that was not consumed </p><p>immediately.  However, when asked how bottles were cleaned, </p><p>it became apparent that a significant risk of contamination </p><p>of the IF was common to these women.  Bottles are washed in </p><p>unsafe water with other household dishes, and they are not </p><p>dried thoroughly prior to use.  When asked whether diarrhea </p><p>or other digestive complaints were common to their infants, </p><p>three of the seven reported that their infants currently had </p><p>diarrhea and vomiting. </p><p> </p><p>6.  One infant, six days old, whose mother had reported </p><p>having very little breast-milk and insufficient food for </p><p>herself, was clearly dehydrated.  This particular family </p><p>grouping (one male, two females, and four children) was the </p><p>most needy of the IDPs visited in Al Zubayr, with </p><p>malnutrition apparent in three of the four children (one </p><p>with oedema), and respiratory infections in two of these </p><p>three.  When asked why the children had not been taken to </p><p>the hospital or clinic, the mother reported that they did </p><p>not have the money.  Other IDP families living in the same </p><p>building had provided some IF and other commodities to this </p><p>family, but supplies among this group were obviously </p><p>limited.  WFP\'s partner for vulnerable group and IDP feeding </p><p>in Basra governorate will coordinate with IOM to provide </p><p>these families assistance. </p><p> </p><p>7.  For those who can afford to buy IF, it is available in </p><p>local markets.  Pre-war market prices for IF in Basra city </p><p>ranged from 450 to 500 Iraqi dinars for 450 grams.  By </p><p>contrast, the PDS food ration is 250 dinars per person. </p><p>Post-war prices stand at 1,400 to 1,500 Iraqi dinar.  Three </p><p>percent of women receiving IF report selling it.  The most </p><p>common reason for sale is to purchase a different brand of </p><p>formula.  WFP reports that brands and respective quantities </p><p>of half-fat and whole-fat IF have varied from distribution </p><p>to distribution.   Mothers report that the variation causes </p><p>diarrhea and other digestive disorders in their infants, so </p><p>if previously distributed brands are available on the </p><p>market, they will sell or swap newly distributed brands </p><p>and/or formulations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>AVAILABILITY OF INFANT FORMULA AND OTHER USES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  The United Nations Children\'s Fund (UNICEF) recently </p><p>released a policy paper, following a meeting in Amman, that </p><p>recommends the immediate deletion of IF from the Oil for </p><p>Food (OFF) general ration.  Approximately 20 percent of </p><p>Iraq\'s total estimated IF requirements would continue to be </p><p>imported under OFF for distribution through medical centers </p><p>and UNICEF\'s Targeted Nutrition Program.  The policy paper </p><p>cites the monthly distribution of double rations since </p><p>November as evidence that sufficient quantities of IF have </p><p>been distributed to last through August.  In their planning </p><p>framework, this date would provide UNICEF and its partners </p><p>ample time to establish/re-establish a nutritional safety- </p><p>net for mothers and infants.  The plan includes the </p><p>provision of IF only when medically prescribed and otherwise </p><p>removes IF from the OFF food basket immediately.  WFP local </p><p>staff strongly disagree with this analysis for the following </p><p>reasons: </p><p>--  Not enough weaning cereals and powdered milk were </p><p>distributed before the war.  Distribution of powdered milk </p><p>has ranged from 13 percent to 25 percent of a full ration </p><p>since the "April-May" distributions, and was not complete in </p><p>earlier distributions.  In many cases, IF has been used to </p><p>supplement the lack of powdered milk.  (Note:  Powdered milk </p><p>is one of the most valued commodities in the OFF food basket </p><p>because it is the sole "breakfast" commodity.   WFP staff </p><p>from all southern governorates indicate powdered milk </p><p>provides urban families their primary source of yogurt-a </p><p>staple in the Iraqi diet.  End Note.)  Staff report that in </p><p>urban areas particularly, where other options for the </p><p>procurement of milk are limited, mothers have been </p><p>using/purchasing IF to complement the diets of weaning-age </p><p>and older children. </p><p> </p><p>--  WFP staff report that when a child is born, it can take </p><p>from two to four months for him or her to be registered in </p><p>the PDS system.  This means that families with children born </p><p>since January are unlikely to have received infant formula </p><p>during the multi-month distributions provided in January, </p><p>February, or March.  With the interruption of the PDS </p><p>registration and tracking systems, this trend is likely to </p><p>continue for several more months.  Under these </p><p>circumstances, families with an excess of IF will give IF to </p><p>families with unregistered infants, either through sale or </p><p>exchange.  Further, WFP staff doubt that existing stores </p><p>will meet even minimum requirements through June. </p><p> </p><p>--  WFP monthly monitoring post-distribution prior to the </p><p>conflict consistently indicated that the OFF food basket </p><p>provided families between 20 to 25 days of their monthly </p><p>food requirements.  WFP staff indicate that the war, and the </p><p>assumption of power by Coalition forces, has raised hopes </p><p>that the ration will be increased.  Deleting any item from </p><p>the food basket now risks being interpreted as disregard for </p><p>the Iraqi people by the Coalition, and deleting something </p><p>that is considered to be necessary will generate even more </p><p>distrust of Iraq\'s interim administration.  WFP points to </p><p>the last time an attempt was made to remove IF from the food </p><p>basket, and the politicized debate it caused as evidence </p><p>that the issue is too sensitive to approach now as a </p><p>unilateral policy decision. </p><p> </p><p>(Comment:  The first two reasons above question the </p><p>assumption that previously distributed quantities of IF will </p><p>tide over bottle-fed infants over until August, and they </p><p>underscore the importance of ensuring that viable </p><p>alternatives and assistance exist for Iraqi women PRIOR to </p><p>the removal of IF from the OFF basket.  The third reason, </p><p>while meaningless in the analysis of the benefits of breast </p><p>feeding over bottle feeding, is certainly relevant to </p><p>attempts to reestablish the PDS as a way of providing the </p><p>population a sense of stability and security during this </p><p>uncertain time.  It also highlights the necessity of </p><p>ensuring a "fit" between sectoral programmatic decisions and </p><p>the political realities of a volatile environment for which </p><p>they are being made.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Given the considerations above, the DART strongly </p><p>recommends that WFP attempt to ensure that 100 percent of </p><p>the IF ration is included in the OFF food basket throughout </p><p>the planned EMOP program period (September). </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
