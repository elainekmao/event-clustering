(SBU) REFTEL PROVIDES LATEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON </p><p>GVN ACTIONS AGAINST SENIOR MONKS OF THE UNIFIED BUDDHIST </p><p>CHURCH OF VIETNAM (UBCV).  THE AMBASSADOR AND OTHER </p><p>EMBASSY/CONGEN OFFICIALS HAVE WEIGHED IN AT VARIOUS </p><p>LEVELS, URGING THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION ORDER BE </p><p>LIFTED FROM THICH QUANG DO, THAT THICH HUYEN QUANG BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO TRAVEL FREELY TO HCMC, AND THAT OTHER OUTSPOKEN </p><p>FIGURES SUCH AS FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY BE ALLOWED TO VOICE </p><p>THEIR NON-VIOLENT OPINIONS WITHOUT GOVERNMENT </p><p>INTERFERENCE.  DCM SPOKE WITH MFA AND OFFICE OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES LAST WEEK, URGING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO FIND A WAY TO DEMONSTRATE ITS "HUMANITARIAN" </p><p>CONCERNS OVER QUANG\'S HEALTH SITUATION AND TO AVOID ANY </p><p>PUBLIC CONFRONTATION WITH UBCV SUPPORTERS. IN THE PAST TWO </p><p>DAYS, POLCOUNS, SENIOR ADVISOR AND POLOFF MET WITH </p><p>MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY (MPS) DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL </p><p>RELATIONS TO PRESS THESE POINTS.  LIKEWISE, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>HAS RAISED OUR CONCERNS WITH MINISTER OF PLANNING AND </p><p>INVESTMENT GIA AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS.  WE ALSO </p><p>CONTINUE TO PRESS OUR INTERESTS WITH MFA AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE ON RELIGION. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) CLOSE POLICE SURVEILLANCE OF UBCV MONKS AT THEIR </p><p>VARIOUS PAGODAS LIKELY WILL PREVENT ANY OF THEM FROM </p><p>MEETING WITH THICH HUYEN QUANG OR THICH QUANG DO FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING.  THE AUTHORITIES\' SUCCESS IN BLOCKING THE </p><p>VISIT TO THICH HUYEN QUANG NO DOUBT WILL ONLY ADD TO THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01388  080509Z </p><p>FRUSTRATION AND RESENTMENT OF HIS SUPPORTERS.  SHOULD </p><p>QUANG\'S HEALTH EVENTUALLY FAIL WHILE STILL IN ISOLATION IN </p><p>QUANG NGAI, THE PUBLIC OUTCRY WILL GET CONSIDERABLY </p><p>STRONGER AND GO BEYOND THE UBCV AND ITS SUPPORTERS. </p><p>VIETNAM\'S DECISION TO PLACE THE ACTIVIST MONK THICH QUANG </p><p>DO UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION, WILL CONTINUE TO HURT </p><p>VIETNAM\'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) THE TOUGH ACTION AGAINST DISSIDENTS BEGAN DURING </p><p>EX-PARTY CHIEF LE KHA PHIEU\'S TENURE AND IS LIKELY ON </p><p>"AUTOMATIC PILOT." THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE SEEN A </p><p>STEADY ESCALATION OF ACTIVISM ON THE PART OF RELIGIOUS </p><p>FIGURES SEEKING LARGELY TO PROMOTE A POLITICAL AGENDA IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  FOR A TIME, THEY SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAKENED POSITION OF PARTY-BOSS LE KHA </p><p>PHIEU WHOSE LEADERSHIP WAS UNDER CHALLENGE.  PHIEU, </p><p>HOWEVER, SEEMED ABLE TO UTILIZE THESE ACTIVITIES AND THE </p><p>DISTURBANCES IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS TO ADVANCE HIS OWN </p><p>CLAIMS FOR MORE ATTENTION TO "STABILITY," RESULTING IN THE </p><p>"GET TOUGH" POLICY AGAINST SUCH FIGURES AS FATHER LY, </p><p>THICH QUANG DO, AND HOA HAO LEADER LIEM. </p><p> </p><p> 4. (SBU) PHIEU\'S EFFORTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR </p><p>"STABILITY" WERE UNABLE TO REVERSE HIS DECLINING POLITICAL </p><p>STATURE AND HE WAS REPLACED BY NONG DUC MANH WHO CAME </p><p>ABOARD WITH A "REFORMIST" IMAGE.  BUT HIS FEW SHORT WEEKS </p><p>OF TENURE SEEM TO HAVE INTENSIFIED THE "TESTING PERIOD" </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS.  THE ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN PUSHING </p><p>THEIR POLITICAL AGENDA TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH </p><p>AND THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN ACTING MORE FORCEFULLY </p><p>TO DEMONSTRATE THE NEED FOR THE LEADERSHIP TO RESTRICT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01388  080509Z </p><p>THIS ACTIVISM.  THE SECURITY FORCES -- ALREADY SOMEWHAT </p><p>DIMINISHED IN PRESTIGE BY PUBLIC CRITICISM AT THE PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS -- ARE PROBABLY ALSO "TESTING" TO SEE HOW THEY </p><p>MAY FARE UNDER MANH\'S LEADERSHIP.  FOR HIS OWN PART, </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY MANH STILL NEEDS TIME TO FEEL OUT THESE </p><p>COMPETING INTERESTS WITHIN THE PARTY, GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>SOCIETY BEFORE HE AND THE OTHER NEW LEADERS CAN PUT THEIR </p><p>IMPRINT ON NATIONAL POLICY.  FOR THE MISSION AND THE USG, </p><p>THIS IS A TIME TO COUNSEL "MODERATION" AND TO AVOID A </p><p>PUBLIC CONFRONTATION ON THE ISSUES.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>WORK WITH ALL SIDES TO SEEK NEW AVENUES OF CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>ENGAGEMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
