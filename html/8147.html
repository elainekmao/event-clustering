Ashley Wills: </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In the latest effort to get the peace </p><p>process on track, GoN Deputy Foreign Minister Helgesen </p><p>met with the Tigers, May 17.  Helgesen told us that he </p><p>urged the Tigers to attend the Tokyo donors conference. </p><p>In response, the Tigers agreed to review Norwegian </p><p>proposals re assistance issues and respond within the </p><p>next several days.  Helgesen said he would call the </p><p>Deputy Secretary to brief him on the situation, May 22 </p><p>or 23.  Re Tokyo, with the Japanese worried about the </p><p>issue, the GSL wants the conference to go forward as </p><p>planned regardless of whether the Tigers participate. </p><p>Given that the Tigers are showing little sign of give so </p><p>far, the question of whether Tokyo should go forward is </p><p>under increasing scrutiny.  Mission will provide its </p><p>recommendation regarding Tokyo by Wednesday, May 21. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Norwegians continue Efforts with Tigers </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesen </p><p>met with Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>officials led by political chief S.P. Thamilchelvam on </p><p>May 17.  The meeting took place in the LTTE-controlled </p><p>town of Kilinochchi.  (Note:  The May 17 meeting served </p><p>as a follow-up to Foreign Minister Petersen\'s and </p><p>Japanese Special Envoy Akashi\'s recent meetings with the </p><p>LTTE.  All of these meetings were part of the general </p><p>diplomatic effort to convince the LTTE to return to the </p><p>peace talks and attend the June donors conference in </p><p>Tokyo -- see Reftels.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) At a May 19 lunch held before he left Colombo, </p><p>Helgesen told the Ambassador that he had urged the </p><p>Tigers to reconsider their recent decision not to </p><p>participate in the June donors conference in Tokyo.  In </p><p>doing this, Helgesen said he reviewed with the LTTE a </p><p>series of Norwegian-crafted proposals meant to meet the </p><p>group\'s concerns that an appropriate amount of </p><p>humanitarian and developmental assistance be funneled to </p><p>the north and east.  (Note:  The Tigers have expressed </p><p>concerns that much of the assistance would ultimately </p><p>wind up in the south unless strict controls were put in </p><p>place.)  The Norwegian side stressed to the Tigers that </p><p>additional details on how the aid would be distributed </p><p>and the form of the structure controlling it would have </p><p>to be worked out later in consultation with the GSL and </p><p>the donor community.  In their response, Helgesen </p><p>commented that the Tigers reiterated their demands that </p><p>some sort of long-term assistance-disbursing structure </p><p>be set up soon and that the LTTE have an important say </p><p>as to how the assistance is allocated.  The Tigers, </p><p>however, agreed to review the Norwegian proposals and </p><p>respond within the next several days.  Helgesen said he </p><p>planned to telephone Deputy Secretary Armitage on May 22 </p><p>or 23 to review the situation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) When queried by the Ambassador, Helgesen said he </p><p>"maintained hope" that the Tigers would eventually come </p><p>to Tokyo.  He noted that he understood Japanese </p><p>government anxiety over whether or not the conference </p><p>was going forward, given that they were the hosts and </p><p>had to set up the event.  The GoJ seemed to be in a </p><p>panic mode, however, which was not the best position to </p><p>be in when reviewing next steps.  If the Tigers decided </p><p>not to go to Tokyo, Helgesen said the GoN\'s preference </p><p>would probably be to postpone the conference </p><p>indefinitely.  If that happened, the Norwegian </p><p>facilitation effort would focus on trying to restart the </p><p>peace talks.  A key part of any such effort, Helgesen </p><p>noted, would be to improve the level of trust shared by </p><p>the LTTE and the government, which was now at its lowest </p><p>point since the kickoff of the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Regarding his recent interactions with the Tiger </p><p>leadership, Helgesen had some interesting comments.  He </p><p>said it was becoming quite clear to the GoN that the </p><p>military, hard-line camp within the Tigers was having an </p><p>increasing influence on LTTE strategy.  Such hard-line </p><p>officials as Sea Tiger leader Soosai, and military </p><p>commanders Karuna and Banu were becoming more active on </p><p>policy issues and as advisers to LTTE leader </p><p>Prabhakaran.  Helgesen said it was not that longtime </p><p>LTTE negotiator Anton Balasingham had been sidelined, </p><p>but it seemed that his relatively moderate voice was no </p><p>longer the only one that was influencing Prabhakaran. </p><p>Asked about Prabhakaran himself, Helgesen said he had </p><p>met the Tiger leader three times thus far and had come </p><p>away with the impression that he (Prabhakaran) was </p><p>acting the part of a "politician."  As mentioned, </p><p>however, Prabhakaran seemed to be more under the </p><p>influence of hard-line advisers at this point than he </p><p>had in the past.  Nonetheless, Prabhakaran still seemed </p><p>committed to the peace track, Helgesen remarked. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) (((Note:  Further re LTTE in-house machinations, </p><p>both Norwegian and GSL contacts have told us that they </p><p>wonder whether Balasingham\'s recent departure from Sri </p><p>Lanka back to his London home was really due to health </p><p>problems or was more politically inspired.  These </p><p>contacts assert that Balasingham may have left Sri Lanka </p><p>because Prabhakaran was using his hard-line advisers </p><p>more and did not need Balasingham as much.  In any case, </p><p>contacts have told us that a lot of "gamesmanship" seems </p><p>to be taking place within LTTE circles at this time.))) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>GSL wants Tokyo to go Forward </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In several conversations with the Ambassador </p><p>over the May 17-18 weekend, key Sri Lankan Minister </p><p>Milinda Moragoda stressed that the government wants the </p><p>Tokyo donors conference to go forward no matter what the </p><p>LTTE does.  Moragoda was quite emphatic on this point, </p><p>stressing that if the conference is postponed the </p><p>government could come under significant criticism in the </p><p>south.  He said he had heard indications that the </p><p>Japanese government might be planning to postpone the </p><p>conference if the LTTE did not change its mind soon.  He </p><p>urged the U.S. to use its influence on Tokyo to stay the </p><p>course.  The Ambassador replied that the decision to go </p><p>forward with the conference was primarily a Japanese </p><p>decision since they were the hosts.  The U.S. was </p><p>carefully monitoring the situation and had not yet taken </p><p>a position on the issue.  There seemed to be good </p><p>reasons both for the conference to take place as planned </p><p>and for postponing it if the Tigers were not there.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that it was a difficult matter and, in </p><p>making any recommendation to the Japanese, the U.S. </p><p>would take GSL views into account. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Japanese set to wait several days </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Re Tokyo, Japanese Ambassador Otsuka told the </p><p>Ambassador May 19 that his government was not rushing to </p><p>a decision re postponing the conference, but had decided </p><p>to await word as to the results of the latest Norwegian </p><p>facilitation effort.  Information regarding the Tigers\' </p><p>response to Norway should be out by the end of the week </p><p>and the Japanese would abstain from taking a decision re </p><p>the conference until that time, he said. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) With the Tigers showing little sign of give so </p><p>far, the question of whether Tokyo should go forward is </p><p>under increasing scrutiny.  Based on today\'s meeting </p><p>with Helgesen, the Norwegians do not seem to believe </p><p>that it will be too big a deal if Tokyo is postponed. </p><p>Moragoda, however, clearly does.  In the meantime, the </p><p>Japanese -- who have raised the concerns of the </p><p>Norwegians and the GSL through their panicky behavior -- </p><p>seem to have calmed down somewhat and are now prepared </p><p>to wait-and-see.  (Note:  We are receiving increasing </p><p>reports that the Norwegians and the Japanese are not </p><p>getting along, which is no doubt not helping matters. </p><p>The Norwegians seem to perceive the Japanese as being </p><p>clumsy, inflexible, and secretive.)  Mission is </p><p>carefully reviewing this whole issue and will provide </p><p>Washington its recommendation on how the USG should </p><p>proceed re Tokyo in the next day or so.  (Note:  We have </p><p>received late word that the Norwegians are tentatively </p><p>planning a meeting of key local ambassadors early May 20 </p><p>to discuss what to do about Tokyo.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
