<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 06483 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP EXCLUSIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PTER, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: ABU NIDAL AND THE BITAR ASSASSINATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 371962; B) STATE 371963 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING A CALL AT THE MFA ON 8 DECEMBER I PRESENTED </p><p>REFTEL B ANALYSIS AND ANNEX OF THE ABU NIDAL TER- </p><p>RORIST ORGANIZATION TO UNDERSECRETARY SULAIMAN MAJID </p><p>AL-SHAHEEN.  POINTING OUT THE VICIOUS ATTACKS PER- </p><p>PETRATED BY ABU NIDAL\'S GROUP OVER THE PAST YEARS I </p><p>STRESSED THE GRAVE THREAT THAT THE ORGANIZATION CON- </p><p>STITUTES FOR ALL OF US, PARTICULARLY MODERATE ARAB </p><p>STATES SUCH AS KUWAIT.  I EMPHASIZED TO AL-SHAHEEN </p><p>THAT THE USG WOULD DO ALL IT COULD TO INTERDICT </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS AND URGED THE GOK TO COOPERATE WITH </p><p>US TO THIS END.  I ASKED THE  GOK TO USE ITS INFLUENCE </p><p>WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO DENY A </p><p>SAFE HAVEN AND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR SUSPECTED </p><p>MEMBERS OF ABU NIDAL\'S ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ABU NIDAL WAS OBVIOUSLY A TOPIC OF INTEREST TO </p><p>AL-SHAHEEN.  TURNING TO THE MOST RECENT ACT BY ABU </p><p>NIDAL\'S GROUP, THE ASSASSINATION OF AL-BITAR IN AMMAN </p><p>ON 14 NOVEMBER, AL-SHAHEEN INFORMED ME THAT THE PAL- </p><p>ESTINIAN ASSASSINS WERE FROM KUWAIT, HAD ATTENDED </p><p>BISHAR ROOMI SCHOOL, FAILED IN THEIR STUDIES, AND </p><p>THEN HAD BEEN RECRUITED BY THE GROUP, PRESUMABLY OUT- </p><p>SIDE OF KUWAIT.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN HAD APPROACHED THE GOK ON 7 </p><p>DECEMBER WITH INFORMATION THAT DURING THE INTERROGATION </p><p>OF THE TWO PALESTINIANS THEY PROVIDED INFORMATION </p><p>ABOUT THE 1985 CAFE\' BOMBINGS IN KUWAIT.  AL-SHAHEEN </p><p>STATED THE GOK HAD DISPATCHED SOMEONE TO JORDAN </p><p>IMMEDIATELY TO FOLLOW UP THE INVESTIGATION OF A </p><p>CONNECTION BETWEEN  ABU NIDAL AND THE BOMBINGS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE GOK REALIZES ALL TOO WELL THE THREAT THAT THE </p><p>ABU NIDAL GROUP POSES, NOW MORE THAN EVER.  SHOULD </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS COME TO THEIR ATTENTION THEY </p><p>MAY BE WILLING TO SHARE THEIR INFORMATION WITH US. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QUAINTON </p><p></p></div>
