<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ALEXANDRIA 000373 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, KISL, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: ALEXANDRIA: IMPROVING THE NEIGHBORHOODS </p><p>         AND (BY) MOVING OUT THE FUNDAMENTALISTS </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA IS UNDERTAKING </p><p>A MAJOR PROGRAM TO IMPROVE HOUSING AND GENERAL LIVING </p><p>CONDITIONS IN MANY OF ITS POORER NEIGHBORHOODS.  ONE </p><p>PROGRAM ELEMENT, INVOLVING THE RELOCATION OF </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS, IS IN PART INTENDED TO ROOT </p><p>OUT AND ISOLATE EXTREMISTS AND THEIR FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>SYMPATHIZERS.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SURVEYING </p><p>NEIGHBORHOODS AND PREPARING LOCAL IMPROVEMENT PLANS </p><p>ALSO SEEK TO IDENTIFY FUNDAMENTALIST TROUBLEMAKERS, </p><p>WHO ARE THEN RELOCATED TO AREAS AWAY FROM THEIR </p><p>LIKE-MINDED FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE OFFICIAL PRESS MAY 10 REPORTED THAT THE </p><p>CITY OF ALEXANDRIA WAS ENGAGED IN A 186 MILLION L.E. </p><p>(ABOUT USD 55 MILLION) PROGRAM OF NEIGHBORHOOD </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS.  TARGETTED AT FIFTY-SIX POOR </p><p>NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY, THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO </p><p>IMPROVE HOUSING, ROADS, SEWAGE FACILITIES AND WATER </p><p>SUPPLIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (LOU) A LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER AND A DISTRICT MAYOR </p><p>WHOM WE SPOKE WITH SEPARATELY WERE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT </p><p>THE PROGRAM.  BOTH EMPHASIZED THE CARE WHICH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS TAKING TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS </p><p>OF EACH NEIGHBORHOOD.  THEY CLAIMED THAT SOCIAL </p><p>WORKERS HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH VISITING THE </p><p>NEIGHBORHOODS TO SURVEY THE NEEDS OF LOCAL RESIDENTS </p><p>AND THEN HELP PLAN A SUITABLE PROGRAM.  IN AREAS </p><p>WHERE HOUSING IS COMPLETELY UNSUITABLE, RESIDENTS </p><p>WILL BE PREMANENTLY RELOCATED TO HOUSING ELSEWHERE, </p><p>SUCH AS IN THE NOW-LARGELY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT OF </p><p>AMREYA, NEAR THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY.  WHERE </p><p>HOUSING IS NOT SO BAD, OR WHERE ROAD, SEWER, AND </p><p>OTHER IMPROVEMENTS HAVE TO BE MADE, RESIDENTS MIGHT </p><p>BE RELOCATED FOR A SHORT TIME TO TEMPORARY FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (LOU) OUR CONTACTS STRESSED THE ATTENTION WHICH IS </p><p>BEING PAID TO THE NEEDS OF NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, IF SOCIAL WORKERS DETERMINE THAT </p><p>RESIDENTS TO BE RELOCATED INCLUDE LARGE NUMBERS OF </p><p>CHILDREN, SCHOOLS WILL BE BUILT IN THE NEW HOUSING </p><p>AREAS.  ALSO, IF LARGE NUMBERS OF WORKERS ARE </p><p>DISPLACED FROM CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THEIR JOBS BY THE </p><p>RELOCATION, ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO IMPROVING </p><p>TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (LOU) BOTH OFFICIALS DISCOUNTED THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO </p><p>LEAVE THEIR HOMES.  FIRST OF ALL, THE RESIDENTS ARE </p><p>BEING MOVED TO MUCH-IMPROVED HOUSING.  SECONDLY, OUR </p><p>CONTACTS CLAIMED, MOST OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE </p><p>TARGETTED NEIGHBORHOODS ARE MIGRANTS FROM OUTSIDE OF </p><p>THE CITY.  THEY HAVE LITTLE LONG-TERM ATTACHMENT TO </p><p>THEIR COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) OUR CONTACTS BOTH VOLUNTEERED THAT THERE IS A </p><p>SECURITY ASPECT TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM.  THOSE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH SURVEYING THE </p><p>NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ALSO IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL </p><p>TROUBLEMAKERS, SUCH AS FUNDAMENTALISTS, WHO ARE OF </p><p>CONCERN TO SECURITY OFFICIALS.  THOSE RESIDENTS WHO </p><p>ARE OF CONCERN WILL BE RELOCATED TO AREAS AWAY FROM </p><p>LIKE-MINDED NEIGHBORS OR TROUBLEMAKERS FROM OTHER </p><p>NEIGHBORHOODS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  ALEXANDRIAS AMBITIOUS IMPROVEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM IS UNDOUBTEDLY PART OF A NATIONAL EFFORT TO </p><p>TARGET SOME SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CAUSES OF </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST EXTREMISM.  THOSE OFFICIALS WITH WHOM </p><p>WE SPOKE, WHO HAVE IN THE PAST HAVE SHOWN A KEEN </p><p>SENSE AND CONCERN FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS NEEDS, SEEM </p><p>GENUINELY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT; THE DISTRICT MAYOR </p><p>SAID HE HOPED TO SEE REAL PROGRESS IN SIX MONTHS TO A </p><p>YEAR.  IT IS INTERESTING THAT OUR CONTACTS FREELY </p><p>DISCUSSED THE SECURITY ASPECTS OF THE ALEXANDRIA </p><p>PROGRAM, ACKNOWLEDGING THE NEED TO ROOT OUT AND </p><p>ISOLATE EXTREMISTS WHILE ELIMINATING THE REASONS FOR </p><p>AND SOURCES OF THEIR LOCAL SUPPORT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>FISHBEIN </p><p></p></div>
