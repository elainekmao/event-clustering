(U)  Introduction:  The Peoples\' Democratic Party, a </p><p>hybrid from its inception, has been riven by internal power </p><p>struggles, weakened by presidential interference, and now </p><p>faces significant challenges gearing up for its own </p><p>convention, much less the battery of local (2002) State and </p><p>Federal (2003) elections that loom on the horizon (Ref. A). </p><p>The PDP is still the incumbency-protection vehicle of choice, </p><p>and as such, will command a strong following.  Whether the </p><p>PDP, through what heretofore has been a rather combative </p><p>process, can evolve into the semblance of a party with an </p><p>identifiable substantive platform for Nigeria, (beyond </p><p>retaining power for its members and returning Obasanjo for a </p><p>second term) is a long stretch.  In order to place current </p><p>events in perspective, we offer the following refresher on </p><p>the PDP.  An analysis of the current PDP conventioneering </p><p>will be provided by septel.  End Introduction. </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Beginnings: G-18, G-34 </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2. (U)  The G-18 was formed in 1997 by prominent Northern </p><p>politicians who opposed the self-succession bid by military </p><p>strong-man Sani Abacha.  At the time, the G-18 involved </p><p>significant risks, including imprisonment.  Many members were </p><p>former Abacha ministers, including chairman Chief Solomon </p><p>Lar, Abubakar Rimi, Adamu Ciroma and Jerry Gana.  Other key </p><p>participants included: Retired Colonel Abubakar Dangiwa Umar, </p><p>the first prominent Northerner to publicly challenge Abacha\'s </p><p>self-succession bid, Dr. Suleiman Kumo, Balarabe Musa, Sule </p><p>Lamido, and Dr. Usman Bugaje.  Retired General and former </p><p>Presidential aspirant Shehu Yar\'Adua\'s political machine, the </p><p>Peoples\' Democratic Movement, was represented by Lawal Kaita </p><p>and Ango Abdullahi.  Of these, only Gana (Minister of </p><p>Information), Lamido (Minister of Foreign Affairs), Ciroma </p><p>(Minster of Finance), and Bugaje (Special Advisor to the V.P. </p><p>on political matters) have retained formal roles in </p><p>government or the Party.  Lar became PDP Chairman for a time </p><p>but was removed soon after Obasanjo\'s election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  The G-18 expanded to the G-34 with the addition of </p><p>members from the East, Southwest, and South-South.  Alex </p><p>Ekwueme, Vice-President under Shehu Shagari during the Second </p><p>Republic, represented Igbo interests, while Chief Bola Ige </p><p>represented Afenifere and the Yoruba.  Ekwueme, who later </p><p>opposed Obasanjo for the PDP presidential nomination, became </p><p>Chairman of the G-34 with Gana as Secretary.  The G-34\'s </p><p>platform was simple: free elections, generals not invited. </p><p>After Abacha\'s climactic exit from the political scene, the </p><p>five parties he created to support his self-succession bid, </p><p>which Bola Ige called the "five fingers of a leprous hand," </p><p>dissolved, leaving the G-34 as the only significant national </p><p>political organization.  G-34 became the PDP in July 1998, </p><p>and Ekwueme was elected Chairman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Transition </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  At the time of Abacha\'s death, the PDP\'s conservative </p><p>wing was led by former members of the National Party of </p><p>Nigeria (NPN): Ekwueme, Ciroma, Ambassador Jibril Aminu, </p><p>Chief Sunday Awoniyi (leader of the former All Nigeria </p><p>Congress), Chief Don Etiebet, Audu Ogbeh, Bamanga Tukur (NRC </p><p>candidate for president during the Third Republic) and Aminu </p><p>Wali.  Their platform included preserving political stability </p><p>through traditional rulers and institutions, promoting </p><p>private sector growth and limiting the role of government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  The progressives envisaged a more social-democratic </p><p>role for government: they wanted to limit the role of </p><p>traditional rulers and institutions in society and increase </p><p>the role of government in providing essential social </p><p>services, including education, health-care and physical </p><p>infrastructure.  The progressives, like most of the elite </p><p>here, gained wealth and prominence in traditional Nigerian </p><p>fashion: as either contractors to or senior officials in the </p><p>GON, its ministries and parastatals.  Still, the progressives </p><p>are generally disturbed by the disparities of wealth that </p><p>exist in Nigeria, and view improving the lot of the common </p><p>people as key to Nigeria\'s economic and political growth. </p><p>Solomon Lar, Abubakar Rimi, Sule Lamido, Jerry Gana, </p><p>Okwesilieze Nwodo, and Bola Ige led the progressives.  The </p><p>other significant progressive element in the PDP was </p><p>Yar\'Adua\'s PDM.  PDM leaders included current VP Atiku </p><p>Abubakar, former Senate President Chuba Okadigbo, Lawal </p><p>Kaita, Yomi Edu, Dapo Sarumi and Sunday Afolabi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Sani\'s Boys </p><p>----------- </p><p>6. (C)  Abacha-ites, seeing their only opportunity for </p><p>retaining political relevance--and access to cash-- clambered </p><p>aboard the increasingly crowded PDP lifeboat.  These included </p><p>Tony Anenih one of the leaders of the YEAA (Youth Earnestly </p><p>Ask for Abacha), currently Minister of Works and Housing and </p><p>reported to be among the most corrupt of Obasanjo\'s </p><p>notoriously rapacious ministers; Barnabas Gemade, current PDP </p><p>Chairman; Dr. Samuel Ogbemudia and Jim Nwobodo, currently a </p><p>senator from Enugu State and perennial facilitator of </p><p>Anenih\'s political "fixes" in the Senate for Obasanjo. </p><p>Nwobodo was also the key spoiler employed by former military </p><p>Head of State Ibrahim Babangida to divide the Igbos and </p><p>defeat Ekwueme\'s bid for the Presidential nomination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>The Invisible Hand </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Not to be forgotten, or excluded, the Generals </p><p>circled the PDP warily in the beginning.  Upon realizing that </p><p>it would determine the immediate political future of Nigeria, </p><p>they moved in for the taking.  These included Ibrahim </p><p>Babangida, Abdulsalami Abubakar and most importantly, </p><p>Obasanjo\'s NSA, Aliyu Mohammed Gusau.  Their interests were </p><p>simple: protect their assets, prevent serious inquiry into </p><p>their actions, and retain political power by remaining the </p><p>"invisible hand" guiding, or at times forcing, political </p><p>outcomes favorable to their position.  More than any other </p><p>element within the PDP, the Generals were responsible for </p><p>Obasanjo,s candidacy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Yoruba Split </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Bola Ige, leader of the Afenifere and the </p><p>Southwestern faction within the PDP, exited the Party once </p><p>Abacha\'s sidekicks entered.  Ige,s departure was perhaps </p><p>inevitable--Abiola\'s death shattered Yoruba hopes to </p><p>resuscitate the 1993 election results; participating in a </p><p>party that included Abiola\'s jailers, and possible </p><p>executioners, was therefore abhorrent to Yoruba leaders.  The </p><p>departing Yoruba eventually created the Alliance for </p><p>Democracy, arguably the only Fourth Republic party with a </p><p>reasonably unified identity and platform: that the identity, </p><p>Yoruba ethnicity, and the platform, promoting Southwestern </p><p>interests, were regional rather than national heightened the </p><p>AD\'s appeal in the Southwest but limited its effectiveness </p><p>nationwide.   Ige\'s departure from the PDP did, however, </p><p>prevent the Southwest from determining which Yoruba candidate </p><p>would get the PDP Presidential nomination.  (Comment: </p><p>Whatever their political affiliation, many Nigerians at that </p><p>time felt that historical justice demanded the Presidency be </p><p>zoned to the Southwest in 1999.   In any non-military </p><p>Nigerian government, elections, constitutions, and executive </p><p>nominations must conform to the ineluctable pressure of the </p><p>zoning system, which exists to make sure each region gets a </p><p>bite of the apple.  Even now, zoning still appears to trump </p><p>other considerations.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Why Obasanjo? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  IBB probably was the most powerful force behind </p><p>Obasanjo obtaining the PDP presidential nomination.  The </p><p>Generals\' arguments, enhanced by financial incentives, won </p><p>the day.  The arguments favoring Obasanjo included: (1) </p><p>Obasanjo was Yoruba. (2) As one of their own, he would be </p><p>able to manage the military, yet protect its core interests </p><p>with an authority that a civilian president might find </p><p>difficult to muster.  (This has proven largely to be the </p><p>case.   Obasanjo has retired nearly two generations of senior </p><p>military staff during his first two years in office, a move </p><p>that a civilian president would have found more difficult.) </p><p>(3) Obasanjo did a fairly good job, comparatively speaking, </p><p>as military ruler and oversaw the successful transition to </p><p>the Second Republic. (4) Obasanjo, having "diverted" </p><p>substantial sums during his tenure as Head of State would </p><p>ultimately protect the position of his former military </p><p>colleagues and their political associates, preventing any </p><p>serious attempt to recover stolen money or try them for human </p><p>rights abuses.  (While he did not prevent the Oputa Human </p><p>Rights Panel from issuing summonses to IBB, Abubakar and </p><p>Buhari, Obasanjo\'s refusal to compel the triumvirate of </p><p>ex-Generals to appear before the Panel has satisfied this </p><p>expectation.)  (5) Still, the argument that won the day for </p><p>Obasanjo during the first PDP convention was, by all </p><p>appearances--cash. </p><p>10. (C)  Arguments within the PDP against Obasanjo included: </p><p>(1) Obasanjo was not a politician and his allegiance to </p><p>democratic processes (i.e. power sharing) in government, once </p><p>elected, was undetermined.  (2) He had no constituency to </p><p>deliver to the Party as the Yoruba had generally rejected </p><p>him.  (3) His nomination would snub Ekwueme, a qualified, </p><p>experienced politician and PDP founder.  (4) As a former </p><p>military dictator he would lack an understanding of, or </p><p>sympathy for, democratic institutions and practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  During the Jos convention in January 1999, the </p><p>Generals\' arguments, buoyed by significant amounts of their </p><p>money, secured the nomination of Obasanjo over Ekwueme.  Most </p><p>of the Northern leadership sided with the Generals for </p><p>Obasanjo.  Key elements of the late Yar\'Adua\'s progressive </p><p>PDM faction, led by Atiku and Okadigbo supported Obasanjo as </p><p>well.  These included Abubakar Rimi, who suspiciously dropped </p><p>his bid for the nomination at the last minute to support the </p><p>Obasanjo candidacy.  Seeing the need for the Presidency to be </p><p>zoned to the Southwest after nearly 12 years of military rule </p><p>by Northern Muslims, and bowing to the political influence of </p><p>IBB, Northern conservatives and traditional rulers also sided </p><p>with Obasanjo.  Having lost the presidential nomination of </p><p>the party he was instrumental in founding, Alex Ekwueme </p><p>solidly delivered Igboland to the PDP, as did his Northern </p><p>counterparts for the North, and Obasanjo was elected </p><p>President in February 1999, with the PDP under the leadership </p><p>of Chief Solomon Lar as Party Chairman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Obasanjo\'s PDP </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  Obasanjo assumed the Presidency with tremendous </p><p>goodwill, except ironically perhaps among his own Yoruba, </p><p>whose preferred candidate (Olu Falae) he defeated.  He also </p><p>possessed the moral authority of having opposed, and been </p><p>jailed by, Abacha.  However, as many in the party feared, </p><p>President Obasanjo, once elected, showed little understanding </p><p>of--or patience for--the give-and-take of democratic </p><p>politics.  Preferring the role of international statesman to </p><p>domestic consensus builder, Obasanjo expected the Party to be </p><p>the extension of his will domestically.  Former and current </p><p>PDP leaders have described this, with some frustration, as </p><p>Obasanjo\'s tendency to conflate, to his own advantage, the </p><p>presidential and parliamentary systems of democracy: he </p><p>considers himself Prime Minister, in that he demands the PDP </p><p>comply with his wishes, yet has the guaranteed tenure of a </p><p>President, and need not actually lead the party, since he is </p><p>not subject to a no-confidence vote.  This tendency has been </p><p>evinced at several junctures during Obasanjo\'s first term, </p><p>and has left the PDP--already unwieldly-- significantly </p><p>weakened. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Ministerial Appointments </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)  Obasanjo complied with the unwritten rules of zoning </p><p>in making his ministerial appointments, but he did not </p><p>consult with Party leadership, or consider party affiliation </p><p>in making his choices.  Senator Aniete Okon, PDP Publicity </p><p>Secretary during Solomon Lar\'s tenure as Party Chairman, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>commented to Poloff that he was roundly castigated when he </p><p>questioned the President about the appointment of Bola Ige </p><p>(AD) as Minister of Power and Steel.  The President </p><p>reportedly stated that he would make his appointments </p><p>regardless of the Party\'s wishes.  The net effect of this </p><p>approach was to alienate stronger personalities in the party </p><p>that might have lent support during his Presidency.  Many key </p><p>figures in the party were passed over, while the Generals\' </p><p>representative, Aliyu Mohammed Gusau was made NSA, and a </p><p>flock of ex-Abacha officials were given key ministerial </p><p>positions.  In his first round of ministerial appointments, </p><p>Obasanjo appeared to prefer individuals who were compromised </p><p>and conditioned by their their political pasts, and who </p><p>therefore presumably could be controlled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Party Leadership </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  Obasanjo\'s first steps in wresting control of the </p><p>Party came during the November 1999 PDP convention.  Chief </p><p>Sunday Awoniyi, a senior Party founder, was the candidate </p><p>favored by most members as their new chair.  Abacha re-tread </p><p>Barnabas Gemade was the President\'s candidate, but was widely </p><p>opposed because of his close association with Abacha and his </p><p>reputation as being notoriously corrupt, even by Nigerian </p><p>standards.  Gemade was elected, helped by the generous </p><p>administration of cash by the President\'s political fixers, </p><p>led by Tony Anenih.  This practice was so blatant that one </p><p>candidate, Senator Ahmadu Ali, announced at the podium that </p><p>the Presidency was supplying delegates with "Ghana-must-go </p><p>bags" full of cash.  (The colorful plastic-weave bags became </p><p>synonymous with political corruption.)  The message from the </p><p>new President was clear: despite his protestations against </p><p>corruption, the President would not let principle stand in </p><p>the way of his objectives.  Under this venal cloud, the </p><p>Gemade era began.  Ever attuned to double-messages, Party </p><p>members, government officials and Nigerians suspected that </p><p>the new regime, while mouthing words like "transparency," had </p><p>not divorced itself from old style politicking.  Having </p><p>bought Gemade\'s chairmanship at the Jos convention, the </p><p>President was on the road to squandering much of the moral </p><p>authority he brought into office to oppose corruption in </p><p>Nigerian politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C)  Indebted to the President, Gemade functioned as the </p><p>President\'s spokesperson within the Party.  During repeated </p><p>Party and national crises since being elected Chairman, </p><p>Gemade did not seek to arbitrate and resolve disputes </p><p>objectively; instead, he looked to the President for </p><p>direction.  Essentially, Gemade joined Anenih as one of the </p><p>President\'s top two political fixers, and the devolution of </p><p>the PDP into an arm of the Presidency accelerated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>National Assembly Wars </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C)  The PDP "zoned" the Senate Presidency to the Igbo </p><p>during the last round of elections.  When the Senate first </p><p>convened, Chuba Okadigbo was the clear choice of his </p><p>colleagues to be Senate President.  Perhaps because his VP </p><p>was a former PDM leader, but also because of personal animus </p><p>for Okadigbo--a brash, intemperate and brilliant professor of </p><p>political science--Obasanjo opposed his candidacy.  Obasanjo </p><p>wanted Evans Enwerem to be Senate President, and refused to </p><p>be inconvenienced by constitutional niceties like the </p><p>separation of powers.  Enwerem\'s victory was reportedly </p><p>orchestrated by Tony Anenih, with the aid of Jim Nwobodo and </p><p>others in the Senate.  In the House, Salisu Buhari, a 29 </p><p>year-old novice, was elected Speaker with the President\'s </p><p>support.  To Obasanjo,s embarrassment both Enwerem and </p><p>Buhari were soon removed by their colleagues for having lied </p><p>about their credentials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C)  Okadigbo was then elected Senate President in </p><p>November, 1999.  The House elected Rep. Ghali Na\'abba, the </p><p>soft-spoken scion of an old Kano political family, as </p><p>Speaker.  Obasanjo disliked Obadigbo and opposed Na\'abba as </p><p>well.  The Presidency spent the better part of 2000 working </p><p>towards their removal.  These machinations consumed a great </p><p>deal of time and energy during Obasanjo\'s first year in </p><p>office.  The effort seemed driven by a profoundly </p><p>undemocratic streak in the President: Obasanjo tends to </p><p>personalize any opposition, and has preferred to change </p><p>personalities rather than working toward political compromise </p><p>on a given issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU)  After surviving three separate votes to be </p><p>removed, and an onslaught of Executive cash, the conflict </p><p>between the President and Okadigbo reached a dramatic </p><p>stand-off: Okadigbo hid the ceremonial mace to prevent the </p><p>Senate from meeting without him to evict him out from office. </p><p> The President sent nearly one hundred mobile police into his </p><p>residence, ostensibly to retrieve the mace, which was not </p><p>there.  Although Okadigbo survived for a while, his </p><p>colleagues finally succumbed to repeated financial incentives </p><p>to remove him.  Okadigbo was replaced by Senator Anyim Pius </p><p>Anyim, an Igbo political ingenue who, it was correctly </p><p>thought, would be more inclined to do the President\'s bidding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C)  Na\'abba proved more resilient at resisting siege. </p><p>House members who voted to replace Na\'abba were reported by </p><p>multiple sources to have received very healthy payments (up </p><p>to USD 60,000) for their votes.  Payoffs had become </p><p>regularized into a business arrangement.  Predominantly </p><p>Yoruba AD members were paid 1,000,000 naira (roughly USD </p><p>9,500), because they consistently voted with the President. </p><p>PDP and APP members were paid half that amount.  The </p><p>President\'s liaison officer in the House, the ubiquitous </p><p>Esther Uduehi, set up a payment center in the Command Guest </p><p>House at the Villa.  Designated Representatives would then </p><p>collect payoffs for all the Representatives in their State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (C)  Unlike Okadigbo, who commanded loyalty and dislike </p><p>in equal doses among his colleagues, Na\'abba was widely </p><p>respected by House members, excluding AD members.  Another </p><p>significant difference from Okadigbo,s saga was that </p><p>Northern power brokers viewed attempts to replace Na-abba as </p><p>an affront.  Northern representatives, regardless of party </p><p>affiliation rallied around him.  After all the payouts were </p><p>made, but before the no-confidence motion came to a vote, </p><p>House leaders placed a large pile of bound hundred-naira </p><p>notes on the table supporting the ceremonial mace.  By going </p><p>public with the proceeds of the payoffs, the House leadership </p><p>sullied both the President and House members, but protected </p><p>the Speaker. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (C)  Having been only partly successful in replacing the </p><p>PDP\'s National Assembly leadership to please the President, </p><p>Gemade was now called upon to broker a "cease-fire."  A </p><p>commission of Party leadership examined the evidence, which </p><p>included damning video- and audio tape of key Executive </p><p>branch officials bribing House members.  In the face of this </p><p>damaging evidence, the President ended his efforts to remove </p><p>Na\'abba.  The House leadership has retained the tapes as a </p><p>deterrent against future attempt to remove the Speaker, but </p><p>neither side wants the embarrassment of further public </p><p>acknowledgement of their iniquities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>The "Postwar" PDP </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (C)  The President\'s protracted effort to remove Okadigbo </p><p>and Na\'abba produced several results.  With Okadigbo gone, </p><p>and a truce in place with Na\'abba, the 2001 budget passed </p><p>within one month of its presentation to the Assembly, which </p><p>conformed to the Executive\'s understanding of how the budget </p><p>process should work.  Esther Udeuhi once exclaimed to Poloff: </p><p>"This is how it works.  The President presents a budget.  The </p><p>Assembly passes it, unchanged.  Finish!" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (C)  Although the President attained the immediate result </p><p>he wanted, the effect on the Party was highly detrimental. </p><p>Some in the Assembly began to view the AD as the de facto </p><p>party of the President.  PDP members were demoralized and </p><p>began to view the Party as merely an enforcement arm of the </p><p>Presidency.  The PDP remained, however, a vehicle for </p><p>re-election and fund-raising; PDP members in the Assembly </p><p>appear loathe at this point to begin forming more cohesive </p><p>political groupings for fear of losing access to funds and </p><p>Party support for their own re-elections.  In fact, the only </p><p>legislation of real significance passed by the National </p><p>Assembly since the 2001 budget has been the Electoral Reform </p><p>bill, which seeks to compensate for governors\' political </p><p>advantage in filling local government chairman slots with </p><p>their own supporters by postponing the LGA elections from </p><p>2002 to 2003 (Ref. B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Purges </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (C)  In July 2000, at the height of the President\'s </p><p>conflicts with the National Assembly leadership, a group of </p><p>PDP Trustees and founding members issued a communique </p><p>criticizing Obasanjo and Gemade of having eviscerated the </p><p>Party by dictating policy and by their eight-month campaign </p><p>to replace Okadigbo and Na\'abba.  Those participating </p><p>included Abubakar Rimi, Bamanga Tukur, Don Etiebet and Edwin </p><p>Ume-Ezeoke.  Gemade expelled most of the complainants from </p><p>the Party, including Emmanuel Ibeshi, the PDP Publicity </p><p>Secretary.  Ibeshi was expelled for having publicly opposed </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Gemade\'s attempt to extend Party officials\' tenure to four </p><p>years without having to stand for elections during the </p><p>upcoming Party convention. </p><p>Expelled members obtained a court-order compelling their </p><p>re-instatement, but up Gemade refused to comply with the </p><p>order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>A Real Fixer-Upper </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25.  As the President and other PDP incumbents look to the </p><p>2002/2003 election cycle, the debilitated state of the Party </p><p>became apparent--for which Obasanjo bears primary </p><p>responsibility. Obasanjo realized the need to revitalize the </p><p>Party, and chose an independent-minded reformer, Audu Ogbeh, </p><p>as the heir-apparent to Gemade.  True to his nature, Gemade </p><p>turned the local and state Party congresses into a </p><p>street-fight, at one point obtaining a court order suspending </p><p>the upcoming November 9 convention.  Gemade also called a </p><p>meeting of the National Executive Council of the PDP on </p><p>October 27 in which he expelled his former </p><p>partner-in-corruption, Tony Anenih from the Party.  Obasanjo </p><p>called a meeting of the PDP Caucus, including PDP governors, </p><p>National Assembly leadership and the Party leadership the </p><p>following day, which was not attended by Gemade or Nwodo. </p><p>That group voted to re-instate Anenih, and to hold the </p><p>Convention as scheduled on November 9.  The Judge who had </p><p>issued the injunction withdrew it, reportedly having </p><p>collected money from both sides. </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Current Crisis </p><p>-------------- </p><p>26. (C)  The ruling party entered its National Convention </p><p>this past weekend in a divided and weakened state. Party </p><p>congresses for each level of government were supposed to have </p><p>occurred on consecutive weekends: ward congresses on October </p><p>20; local government on the 27; state congresses on November </p><p>3, followed by the National Convention on the 9th.  Each </p><p>level was supposed to elect its own party officials as well </p><p>as delegates to the next congress, culminating in the </p><p>Convention.  There have been extreme irregularities at each </p><p>level, with two Governors, Dariye of Plateau and Kalu of </p><p>Abia, both of who have been at loggerheads with the </p><p>President, cancelling the results of their states\' entire </p><p>ward congresses (Ref. C).  A court injunction obtained after </p><p>the ward congresses, stopped some higher-level congresses, </p><p>while others went forward.  State congresses were held </p><p>November 3, but the delegates sent to these congresses were </p><p>hand-picked by the governors, rather than reflecting the </p><p>earlier party congress results.  Similarly, many of the </p><p>delegates that converged on Abuja will arrive by other than </p><p>transparent selection processes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. (C)  Comment: Rather than postponing the Convention until </p><p>some of the legal, political and interpersonal issues could </p><p>be straightened out, President Obasanjo insisted that the </p><p>Convention hold as scheduled.  This produced the outcome the </p><p>President wanted, but it did little for improving the </p><p>political process in Nigeria\'s ruling party.  End Comment. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
