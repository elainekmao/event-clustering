<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000584 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PTER, VM, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  HANOI 0567    B. FBIS SEP20030311000012 </p><p>-     C.  STATE 63629 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  In a meeting on March 10 devoted primarily to </p><p>bilateral ties (ref a), senior Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen </p><p>Tan Dung described Vietnam\'s "consistent" policy regarding </p><p>Iraq:  The GVN opposed terrorism, opposed using the excuse </p><p>of terrorism to invade another country, and opposed weapons </p><p>of mass destruction.  He urged the international community - </p><p>- working through the UN -- to use "peaceful means" to get </p><p>Iraq to disarm.  (Ref b provides MFA spokeswoman\'s most </p><p>recent iteration of the GVN position on March 7.)  He </p><p>specifically noted that Vietnam would oppose a war against </p><p>Iraq in the absence of a UN Security Council resolution.  He </p><p>emphasized that Vietnam, as a victim of war, opposed war due </p><p>to the suffering, losses, and deaths of innocent civilians. </p><p>He noted that a resort to non-peaceful means would be </p><p>"counter to civilization" in the 21st century. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  DPM Dung added that Vietnam\'s "good relations" with </p><p>Iraq were as two sovereign, independent states that do not </p><p>interfere in each other\'s internal affairs and sought </p><p>mutually beneficial economic ties.  He emphasized that Iraq </p><p>had helped Vietnam during the US embargo on Vietnam by </p><p>enabling it to purchase oil.  He noted that Vietnam owed </p><p>Iraq USD 500 million for those purchases.  (Note:  It was </p><p>not clear whether that was the original or remaining debt.) </p><p>He said that Vietnam sold about USD 500 million worth of </p><p>rice, milk, and other commodities to Iraq each year under </p><p>the UN\'s Food for Oil Program. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Ambassador stressed that the U.S. did not seek war, </p><p>which could have horrible and unpredictable consequences. </p><p>He noted, however, as Secretary Powell had recently stated, </p><p>that the time comes when a clear and credible threat of war </p><p>is the only way to get a response.  He emphasized that </p><p>Saddam Hussein\'s very small responses so far had come only </p><p>because of these threats.  He urged Vietnam to use its good </p><p>relations with Iraq to appeal to its leaders to do what they </p><p>should have been doing regarding disarmament over the past </p><p>twelve years.  He noted that UN inspectors had confirmed the </p><p>existence of WMD programs in the 1990s, but we had yet to </p><p>see sufficient explanations of where these weapons are now. </p><p>He warned that failure to enforce UNSC resolutions could </p><p>have serious consequences for the credibility of the </p><p>institution, citing the example of the League of Nation\'s </p><p>impotence when Italy invaded Abyssinia.  He stressed that </p><p>"time was running out" for the Iraqi leadership to cooperate </p><p>fully as required under UNSCR 1441 and earlier resolutions. </p><p>DPM Dung reiterated his appeal for "peaceful methods" only. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Comment:  Vietnam has already made up its mind on </p><p>Iraq and likely will continue to stick to what it sees as </p><p>the moral high ground of opposing war in general.  We </p><p>suspect even the passage of an additional UNSCR authorizing </p><p>military action would not convince the GVN to add its public </p><p>support to such efforts.  There is, sadly, little likelihood </p><p>that the GVN would ever use whatever channels of </p><p>communication exist between its leaders and Saddam Hussein </p><p>to urge Iraq to do the right thing, and quickly.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  In light of the above, Embassy will not deliver ref </p><p>c demarche request. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
