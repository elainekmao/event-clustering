<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 COLOMBO 000983 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Department for D (Gastright), INR/MR, I/RW, I/REC, </p><p>SA (Camp, Waller), SA/PD (Brennig, Irwin, Scensny) SSA/PAS; </p><p>SSO (Pass to D);  Tokyo (Hara, Bryan) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY: (June 8) Tokyo Conference; Colombo </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  On the eve of the Tokyo Conference, a frenetic </p><p>Sri Lankan media was consumed with talk of an interim </p><p>administration for the north and east and the fate of donor </p><p>money sans LTTE participation.  Tamil newspapers were </p><p>engrossed with Tokyo-related issues large and small - but </p><p>especially with donor money.  Media sympathetic to the GSL </p><p>reiterated the Government`s ability to secure and </p><p>distribute aid money in typically sunny news and editorial </p><p>coverage.  Opposition newspapers led with cohabitation </p><p>drama and offered predictably dour editorial comment. </p><p>Independent media coverage of Tokyo was skeptical and </p><p>prodded the government to "get on with it."  One editorial </p><p>exhorted the Prime Minister to "go the whole hog" in his </p><p>attempt to "bring the Tigers into the mainstream of the Sri </p><p>Lankan polity."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>2. LTTE statements and other Tamil reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Tamil media was obsessed with every aspect of the Tokyo </p><p>Conference - right down to the seven airplane seats </p><p>reserved for the Tigers should they go to Japan.  Two major </p><p>dailies\' headlines were about expected aid money: </p><p>independent weekly VIRAKESARI wrote, "\'As the Tigers are </p><p>not participating, it is expected that certain conditions </p><p>would be laid down in granting aid\' - political observers," </p><p>while state-owned weekly THINAKARAN VAARAMANJARI comforted, </p><p>" \'Aid for development would be spent as stipulated\' - </p><p>Prime Minister assures."  Independent Weekly SUNDAY </p><p>THINAKKURAL\'s lead story cautioned "Tokyo Conference in the </p><p>midst of doubts about the future of the peace talks." </p><p> </p><p>Major independent Tamil daily VIRAKESARI\'s front page </p><p>reported on a variety of other issues:  "Norwegian VIPs </p><p>will not attend the Conference,"  "President refuses to </p><p>meet Prime Minister - did not send any greetings for the </p><p>conference," "\'India will not participate\' - G. L. Peiris," </p><p>and finally, "Seven Visas and seats were reserved for </p><p>Tigers." </p><p> </p><p>Pro-LTTE website Tamilnet headlined (6/7), "Talks should be </p><p>based on concrete proposals - Balasingham." </p><p> </p><p>Block quote: </p><p> </p><p>Negotiations on an Interim Administration for the Northeast </p><p>could only begin once the Sri Lankan government had </p><p>produced a detailed draft of its proposals for such a body, </p><p>the Liberation Tigers said Friday. Discussions could only </p><p>proceed usefully on the basis of "specific and concrete" </p><p>proposals from Colombo, the LTTE\'s Chief Negotiator and </p><p>Political Advisor, Mr. Anton Balasingham, told TamilNet </p><p>when asked about press reports suggesting the government </p><p>had agreed to the establishment of an Interim </p><p>Administration. </p><p> </p><p>End block quote. </p><p> </p><p>Although Tamil editorialists did not write about Tokyo </p><p>today, extensive editorial comment is expected on Tuesday </p><p>and Wednesday. </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline, "Interim administrative mechanism for </p><p>NE imperative," independent, but pro-UNP English weekly </p><p>SUNDAY LEADER ran an interview on its opinion page with </p><p>Senior Vice President, Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) </p><p>and Batticaloa District Member of Parliament, Joseph </p><p>Pararajasingham. </p><p>Block quotes: </p><p>.Pararajasingham says the government\'s position, that an </p><p>interim administration should be established within the </p><p>parameters of the constitution cannot  be justified when </p><p>the ceasefire agreement itself was framed outside the </p><p>constitution. He said if the ceasefire agreement that was </p><p>drafted outside the constitution has paved the way for </p><p>solid peace in the country, he cannot see any reason why </p><p>the government cannot do the same thing to set up the </p><p>interim administration and give the LTTE a legal body </p><p>through which it could have a politico- administrative and </p><p>decision making body to play a dominant role in the </p><p>administration. "If there is a will there is a way. I also </p><p>think the problem faced by the government from the </p><p>executive is also preventing them from fulfilling the </p><p>demands of the LTTE," he told The Sunday Leader in an </p><p>interview. </p><p>Q: Do you see any justification in the LTTE\'s continuous </p><p>refusal to accept proposals put forward by Premier </p><p>Wickremesinghe in regard to the interim administration? </p><p>A: There is sufficient reason for the LTTE to refuse what </p><p>was offered by the Prime Minister, taking into </p><p>consideration the past experience and the history of this </p><p>country in regard to the ethnic issue. You see, the LTTE, </p><p>which was fighting for a separate state and was in a </p><p>formidable position in terms of war, unilaterally declared </p><p>a ceasefire and also signed a Memorandum of Understanding </p><p>with the government because they felt the sufferings of the </p><p>Tamil people had to be alleviated. </p><p>They are now firmly committed to a negotiated settlement. </p><p>They have taken part in six rounds of talks. What was </p><p>promised during the talks has not been implemented. So the </p><p>LTTE has real suspicion about the present proposal. They </p><p>feel it is difficult to overcome red tape and bureaucracy </p><p>through the setting up of the apex body. So they think any </p><p>tangible implementation on the ground has to be through a </p><p>structure, which will give the LTTE a politico- </p><p>administrative and decision making body where they would be </p><p>allowed to play a dominant role. Therefore the proposals </p><p>submitted by the Prime Minister do not in any way answer </p><p>the demands of the LTTE. That falls very short of their </p><p>thinking. </p><p>Q: Many experts, including foreign diplomats say that peace </p><p>cannot be achieved if the Tigers are so rigid. How do you </p><p>view their statements? </p><p>A: It is wrong to say that the Tigers are rigid in their </p><p>demands. As I explained earlier, first of all the </p><p>sufferings of the Tamil people have to be removed. That can </p><p>only be achieved by restructuring and relocating the </p><p>displaced people and rehabilitating them. It also includes </p><p>rehabilitating the war torn north east. In this respect </p><p>they need a very formidable and a very strong set up to </p><p>administer the region. Their demand which is to alleviate </p><p>the suffering of the people, cannot be considered as </p><p>something that is rigid. </p><p>Q: Why do you think the government is reluctant to give </p><p>what the LTTE wants? </p><p>A: Well I think it is because of the non-cooperation of the </p><p>executive that the government is unable to fulfill the </p><p>demands of the LTTE. The government feels that any interim </p><p>administrative structure should be within the parameters of </p><p>the constitution. But what I would like to remind the </p><p>government is this. When the ceasefire agreement was signed </p><p>between the government and the LTTE there was no basis for </p><p>it within the laws of Sri Lanka. It was an extra </p><p>constitutional instrument on which the country\'s peace has </p><p>withstood for more than 15 months and it has laid a solid </p><p>foundation for peace. Why can\'t the government apply the </p><p>same process in formulating an interim administrative </p><p>structure outside the constitution like the ceasefire </p><p>agreement? </p><p> My personal opinion is that the Tamils are fully justified </p><p>in asking for an extra constitutional interim mechanism to </p><p>rebuild and rehabilitate the north east because they never </p><p>accepted the constitution the Britishers left behind in </p><p>1948, the 1972 constitution and the 1978 constitution which </p><p>concentrated the legislative, financial and judicial </p><p>affairs of the island in the hands of the majority of the </p><p>country. Therefore I think the LTTE\'s demand in asking for </p><p>a interim administrative structure is reasonable and </p><p>justifiable, where they could play a dominant role </p><p>politically, administratively and financially. </p><p>Q: The general perception is that the LTTE would </p><p>participate at tomorrow\'s donor conference. How do you see </p><p>it? Do you think failure to participate would be </p><p>disadvantageous to the LTTE? </p><p>A: The LTTE\'s leadership in the latest reply to Prime </p><p>Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has clearly stated that if an </p><p>assurance is given that a draft framework for an interim </p><p>administrative structure along the lines proposed by the </p><p>LTTE leadership is given by the Prime Minister they would </p><p>resume negotiations. So the ball is now in the government\'s </p><p>court. </p><p>Until today the Prime Minister has not responded to the </p><p>request made by the LTTE leadership. Therefore one can be </p><p>convinced that their participation in the Tokyo conference </p><p>is not possible. To answer the other question, this donor </p><p>conference is not only for the rebuilding of the war torn </p><p>north east region. This conference is also a part of the </p><p>annual aid consortium for the government.  If the donor </p><p>countries are really interested in rebuilding, </p><p>rehabilitating and restructuring the war ravaged north </p><p>eastern region I don\'t think there is any reason for them </p><p>to not dole out funds for this humanitarian aspect whether </p><p>the LTTE participates or not. Participation of the LTTE </p><p>should not be taken as a primary concern for the donors not </p><p>to dole out money for the humanitarian projects facing the </p><p>war torn areas in the north east. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>3. GSL statements and pro-government reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Media sympathetic to the GSL offered predictably sunny </p><p>Tokyo coverage.  Newspaper and television lead stories </p><p>reiterated the government `s ability to secure and </p><p>distribute aid money and noted the Prime Minister\'s plans </p><p>for an interim administration. </p><p> </p><p>Independent and state-owned television stations reported </p><p>Chief Negotiator for the Peace Process and Cabinet </p><p>Spokesman G.L. Peiris\' comments that there will be no </p><p>change in the level of aid pledged to Sri Lanka, despite </p><p>the Tigers\' absence in Tokyo.  State-owned ITN television </p><p>elucidated that aid levels will stay the same because the </p><p>trust that international community has placed in the </p><p>Government of Sri Lanka remains unchanged. </p><p> </p><p>Newspapers also focused on the money.  Independent English </p><p>weekly SUNDAY TIMES headlined, "`We-can-spend\' theme at </p><p>Tokyo."  State-owned English weekly SUNDAY OBSERVER </p><p>observed, "Aid pledges on track," while sister Sinhala </p><p>weekly SILUMINA noted, "Comprehensive development plan for </p><p>tomorrow\'s Tokyo confab - Funds to be disbursed for </p><p>immediate projects."  Independent, but pro-UNP English </p><p>weekly SUNDAY LEADER exclaimed, "PM to announce interim set </p><p>up." </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline,"Hope," Government-owned English weekly </p><p>SUNDAY OBSERVER\'s editors commented that despite the </p><p>problems with the peace process, "the Tokyo donor parley </p><p>signals progress." </p><p>Block quotes: </p><p>Most important is the fact that while the negotiating </p><p>process is in suspense right now, the overall peace effort </p><p>remains on track. Both parties have clearly and </p><p>substantively demonstrated their complete lack of desire to </p><p>resort to military action again to achieve their political </p><p>goals. If the LTTE has been careful to make this clear to </p><p>the whole world, the Government\'s own, positive, non- </p><p>belligerent posture on the current impasse has demonstrated </p><p>its own commitment to peace. </p><p>That is why the Tokyo donor parley signals progress despite </p><p>the current problem. Now, all efforts must be made towards </p><p>fulfilling the requisites for overcoming the impasse. If </p><p>the critical problem being raised by the LTTE leadership is </p><p>their exclusion from certain aspects and activities of the </p><p>peace process, then every step must be taken to ensure that </p><p>such exclusion does not occur in the future. </p><p>The setting up of an institutional mechanism that will </p><p>structurally involve the LTTE in the post-war recovery </p><p>process in the North-East will go far not only to ensure </p><p>that organisation\'s continued participation in the </p><p>negotiations but also to guarantee the re-integration of </p><p>whole areas of the country that have been pushed outside </p><p>the national mainstream by the war. </p><p>End block quotes </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>4. Opposition statements and pro-opposition reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Opposition newspapers led with cohabitation drama and Tokyo </p><p>money headlines.  Editorial comment was typically dour and </p><p>concentrated on the untrustworthiness of the LTTE. </p><p>Independent, but nationalist-leaning English weekly ISLAND </p><p>SUNDAY cried, "CBK snubs Japan: refuses statement backing </p><p>confab," but softened the blow and placed "Mood in Tokyo </p><p>optimistic: GL" alongside it.  Sister paper Sinhala DIVAINA </p><p>headlined, "Confab promising 10,000 Kouti [100 lakhs] per </p><p>annum is tomorrow." </p><p> </p><p>State-owned ITN television reported on a meeting between </p><p>USAID Deputy Administrator Fred Schieck and opposition </p><p>leader Mahinda Rajapakse, in which both men noted that </p><p>Tokyo Conference aid could be used for development </p><p>activities in the south as well as the north and east. </p><p>--- Under the headline, "The doubt that will not down," the </p><p>nationalist-leaning English weekly ISLAND SUNDAY\'s editors </p><p>asked whether the LTTE "will use some of that money to </p><p>further militarize for the ultimate putsch." </p><p>Block quotes: </p><p>If the LTTE calculated that their brinkmanship will result </p><p>in the Tokyo meeting being postponed till such time as they </p><p>were willing to talk turkey, they made a grievous error. As </p><p>we have reported on our front page today, the mood in the </p><p>Japanese capital was optimistic yesterday and there was </p><p>reason to expect that they will not come down on any </p><p>pledges they planned to make merely because Prabhakaran and </p><p>Balasingham have played hard to get. Nevertheless, it must </p><p>be freely conceded that there is no doubt that the LTTE\'s </p><p>presence would have made a tangible difference certainly to </p><p>the level of global confidence that the peace process is </p><p>not just on track but heading in the right direction. The </p><p>absence of one party must necessarily create doubts and </p><p>that is the hard reality that we must swallow. It is to be </p><p>hoped that Sri Lanka\'s foreign friends don\'t merely proffer </p><p>carrots but also use some stick in Tokyo. The US has </p><p>certainly been helpful up to now with Ambassador Ashley </p><p>Wills being outspoken in much of what he has said in </p><p>Colombo about Tiger behaviour. It\'s a pity that he is </p><p>ending his assignment here shortly. Hopefully his successor </p><p>will understand the situation as well as he has. </p><p>Finally it must be said that if the kind of money that is </p><p>being spoken about is obtained from the donor community, we </p><p>have to get our act together in efficiently utilizing such </p><p>resources. </p><p>The LTTE certainly has a point that government\'s delivery </p><p>of whatever has been on offer to the war devastated areas </p><p>has been pathetically poor. We certainly have no doubt that </p><p>given their summary methods ("shoot the rogues"), the </p><p>Tigers will do a better job of getting the reconstruction </p><p>and rehabilitation work done much more efficiently than the </p><p>government. But the doubt that will not down is whether </p><p>they will use some of that money to further militarize for </p><p>the ultimate putsch. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>--- Sister paper DIVAINA\'s editorial headline, "Interim </p><p>admin bait," asserts that the Tigers do not want funds "for </p><p>the development of the north and east. it is for the </p><p>benefit of a handful [of Tiger leaders]." </p><p> </p><p>Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"It is surprising that everybody is making such a </p><p>tremendous effort to get the participation of a world\'s </p><p>most brutal terrorist organization at the aid conference... </p><p>How can they be treated on equal terms with a democratic </p><p>government?  Will the monies be snatched by the Tigers who </p><p>claim to be representing the marginalized Tamil communities </p><p>in the north and east?  At the end of the day it is those </p><p>who suffer who will have to pay back these debts... </p><p> </p><p>"The LTTE is shredding crocodile tears for the Tamils .but </p><p>are not prepared to lay down their arms, to renounce </p><p>terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>"Any wise person will realize that the Tigers have vested </p><p>interests.  We know that Anton Balasingham is not working </p><p>with genuine interest-he wants the money not for the </p><p>development of the north and east.it is for the benefit of </p><p>a handful of [Tiger leaders]." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>5. Independent media reaction </p><p>----- </p><p>Independent media coverage of Tokyo was skeptical.  A </p><p>subheadline in independent Sinhala weekly LANKADEEPA\'s </p><p>headline asked, "Are tigers getting ready for another </p><p>fiasco after declaring non participation in the confab?" </p><p>Editorial commentary exhorted the government to address the </p><p>LTTE\'s integration into Sri Lankan politics and corruption. </p><p>--- Under the editorial headline, "Tell It Like It Is," </p><p>independent but pro-UNP English weekly SUNDAY LEADER </p><p>pressed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to "go the </p><p>whole hog" in his attempt to "genuinely to bring the Tigers </p><p>into the mainstream of the Sri Lankan polity." </p><p>Block quotes: </p><p>Clearly, the rose which Wickremesinghe calls  an \'apex </p><p>body\' does not smell as sweet to Balasingham as an \'interim </p><p>administration.\' The nuance, though lost on the LTTE\'s </p><p>Chief Negotiator, is not irrelevant. "In rejecting </p><p>Wickremesinghe\'s elaborately-worded offer of an apex </p><p>committee to oversee north east development, Balasingham </p><p>did not mince his words. He pointed to the inefficiency and </p><p>corruption of the administration in words that must have </p><p>made the Premier wince. And the tragedy is, every word is </p><p>true. </p><p>If Wickremesinghe is serious in his attempt genuinely to </p><p>bring the Tigers into the mainstream of the Sri Lankan </p><p>polity, and not just play for time until the rebels are </p><p>weak enough to demolish militarily (which they might </p><p>justifiably suspect is his plan), he must match his words </p><p>with action. The LTTE must be given incentives to join the </p><p>political mainstream and involving them in an interim </p><p>administration is the key to this. </p><p>In its 2001 manifesto, the UNF promised an interim </p><p>administration for the north and east. Now, Wickremesinghe </p><p>is edging away from that ideal, talking about some nebulous </p><p>committee. This will not do. At some point in a nation\'s </p><p>history, statesmen, not political fudgers, have to take </p><p>strong decisions. That\'s what leadership is about. Polls </p><p>have shown that the overwhelming majority of Sri Lankans as </p><p>a whole and the Tamils as a group, are in favour of a </p><p>negotiated settlement.  It showed that over 90 per cent of </p><p>Tamils were in favour of a federal solution. If that is not </p><p>the surest message that the demand for a separate state is </p><p>a thing of the past, what is? </p><p>Wickremesinghe has committed the nation to peace, the </p><p>welfare of the Tamil people, a negotiated settlement and </p><p>the transfer of significant political authority to the </p><p>LTTE. He must go the whole hog. </p><p>Ranil Wickremesinghe must take the nation (including the </p><p>LTTE) into his confidence. There is simply no point in </p><p>elaborate wordplay and a deft euphemism: that will fool no </p><p>one. Let\'s dispense with the committees and red tape and </p><p>get down to business. Even if he can\'t do it, surely he can </p><p>tell it like it is. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>--- Under the headline, "Get on with it," independent </p><p>English weekly SUNDAY TIMES calls on the government to </p><p>address both the LTTE and corruption, "the foreign monies </p><p>pumped into the system must trickle down to as many </p><p>ordinary people as possible if all this hullabaloo about </p><p>the Tokyo \'aid\' conference is to be meaningful to the </p><p>ordinary folks at home." </p><p>Block quotes: </p><p>The LTTE has made a spectacle of itself to the </p><p>international community. It has not been able to resolve </p><p>the power-struggle between those who want a negotiated </p><p>settlement, and the military-wing mandarins who see their </p><p>own spheres of influence waning if there is a transition to </p><p>peace. </p><p>While the LTTE sorts itself out, however, the Government </p><p>must keep an eye on its own defence mechanism. Irrespective </p><p>of the LTTE\'s own idiosyncrasies of the moment, the </p><p>Government must get on with it, and forge a coherent policy </p><p>that concentrates on the economic development of the entire </p><p>country. </p><p>In this backdrop of events, the Government will need to be </p><p>cautious that reeking corruption in high places and </p><p>monopolies by a handful of people, who are siphoning their </p><p>profits to bank accounts overseas, does not boomerang on </p><p>itself by way of social disorder and revolution. </p><p>And for now, there must be accelerate job creation through </p><p>public investment projects; more ordinary people need more </p><p>money in their hands- and all the foreign monies pumped </p><p>into the system must trickle down to as many ordinary </p><p>people as possible if all this hullabaloo about the Tokyo </p><p>\'aid\' conference is to be meaningful to the ordinary folks </p><p>at home, in the first place. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
