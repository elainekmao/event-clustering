<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001679 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ADVOCACY CENTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2011 </p><p>TAGS: EINV, PREL, ETRD, BEXP, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MOTOROLA\'S BID FOR GSM EQUIPMENT </p><p>CONTRACT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES COMMERCIAL ADVOCACY CASES </p><p>WITH VICE PRESIDENT ABUBAKAR </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Following up from his meeting with </p><p>Motorola representatives on July 9 (following septel from </p><p>Lagos), Ambassador Jeter met the Principal Secretary to </p><p>President Obasanjo, Stephen Oronsaye, on July 10 and with </p><p>Vice President Atiku Abubakar on July 11.  The Vice President </p><p>confirmed that the technical evaluation committee had </p><p>recommended the Motorola bid because it was better qualified </p><p>on all aspects including price, project financing, technical </p><p>qualifications, and delivery time.  However, the Vice </p><p>President said, alleged improprieties between Motorola and </p><p>Director-General Nasir El-Rufai, who chaired the Financial </p><p>Restructuring Committee, invalidated the evaluation </p><p>committee\'s recommendation and caused the President to decide </p><p>in favor of Ericsson.  Both Motorola and Nasir El-Rufai </p><p>dispute these allegations and claim they are completely </p><p>unfounded.  El-Rufai is threatening to take the issue to </p><p>court.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Background </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In May 2001, the GON established the Financial </p><p>Restructuring Committee (FRC) mandated with refinancing NITEL </p><p>debts and seeking long-term financing for the GSM roll-out </p><p>and transmission network expansion.  To conduct the actual </p><p>tendering process, the FRC established a five-man technical </p><p>committee comprised of representatives from NITEL </p><p>(state-owned telecommunications monopoly) and the Bureau of </p><p>Public Enterprises.  There were two rounds of bidding and a </p><p>third round of reassessment to include prices for all omitted </p><p>items according to standard World Bank methodology.  After </p><p>the final reassessment, the evaluation committee submitted </p><p>its report, which recommended Motorola be awarded the </p><p>contract, to the President and Vice President for the final </p><p>decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) On July 5, Embassy advocacy assistance was requested </p><p>on behalf of Motorola in its USD 39.3 million bid for the </p><p>NITEL GSM equipment contract.  The other companies competing </p><p>for the bid are Swedish company Ericsson whose final bid was </p><p>USD 49 million and Shangai Bell of China bidding USD 39 </p><p>million.  On July 6, the Department of Commerce informed the </p><p>Embassy that Ericsson, not Motorola, had been awarded the </p><p>contract.  End Background. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On July 10, Ambassador Jeter met with the Principal </p><p>Secretary to the President Stephen Oronsaye and, on July 11, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>with Vice President Atiku Abubakar to discuss Motorola\'s bid </p><p>for the GSM equipment contract.  In the meeting with </p><p>Oronsaye, Ambassador Jeter emphasized that it was hard to </p><p>understand how Ericsson could have won the bid given </p><p>Motorola\'s lower bid price, best technical specifications, </p><p>and fastest delivery time.  While Oronsaye was not clear on </p><p>all the details of the tendering, he was comfortable that the </p><p>decisions made were in line with the desired transparency and </p><p>integrity of the process.  Oronsaye did mention a possible </p><p>conflict of interest between Bureau of Public Enterprises </p><p>Director-General Nasir El-Rufai, who chaired the Financial </p><p>Restructuring Committee, and Motorola.  This point was </p><p>further elaborated on by the Vice President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) From the outset of the July 11 meeting, the Vice </p><p>President made it clear that he felt no obligation to explain </p><p>the reasons behind the Presidency\'s decision to award the </p><p>contract to Ericsson, but that he would explain in the </p><p>interest of transparency and fairness.  In considering the </p><p>contract award, the Vice President said, he and the President </p><p>looked at the credibility of the exercise, the petitions and </p><p>their desire for Western technology.  Based on these </p><p>considerations they decided to offer the bid to Ericsson. </p><p>Vice President Abubakar confirmed that Ericsson had been </p><p>awarded the contract under the condition that it deliver the </p><p>services at Motorola\'s lower bid price and within 4 months, </p><p>not 5 months as it had proposed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The determining factor in the decision in favor of </p><p>Ericsson appeared to be allegations, brought forth by </p><p>Ericsson, against Motorola.  Vice President Abubakar </p><p>commented that he had received two petitions from Ericsson </p><p>that alleged Nasir El-Rufai was biased in favor of Motorola </p><p>and questioned the validity of the tendering exercise. </p><p>Specifically, Ericsson complained that El-Rufai had a </p><p>conflict of interest because he had worked for Motorola in </p><p>the past.  The Vice President also said that the petition </p><p>claimed that El-Rufai\'s elder brother was a 10 </p><p>percent-shareholder in Motorola.  According to the Vice </p><p>President, El-Rufai\'s failure to respond to these petitions </p><p>in a timely fashion led the Presidency to award the contract </p><p>to Ericsson. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Motorola Regional Sales Director Karen Johanson, who </p><p>was in Nigeria seeking resolution of these issues, disputed </p><p>Ericsson\'s allegations on July 12.  Johanson asserted that </p><p>El-Rufai\'s brother does not hold Motorola stock, although he </p><p>is part-owner of Intercellular Nigeria Ltd., a small fixed </p><p>wireless company in Lagos that distributes Motorola </p><p>equipment.  She said that although El-Rufai worked for </p><p>Motorola for two years prior to his GON employment, he did </p><p>not offer assistance to Motorola during the tendering </p><p>process, "squeezing us just as much as the other companies." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ambassador Jeter asked the Vice President </p><p>hypothetically that even if El-Rufai were biased toward </p><p>Motorola, given the technical committee\'s unanimous vote in </p><p>favor of Motorola, how much influence could one man truly </p><p>have on such a diverse collection of officials.  The Vice </p><p>President argued that if you know El-Rufai personally, you </p><p>would know that "he could sway an entire crowd to agree with </p><p>him on almost any issue."  (Comment.  Since the meeting, </p><p>Embassy has received a copy of El-Rufai\'s written reply to </p><p>the President regarding Ericsson\'s allegations.  His letter </p><p>clarifies that he was not, in fact, on the evaluation </p><p>committee itself, but rather the chairman of the Financial </p><p>Restructuring Committee that oversaw the three evaluation </p><p>committees established for three separate contracts of which </p><p>the GSM equipment contract was one.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Ambassador then raised the concern that, in light </p><p>of irregularities surrounding Ocean Energy\'s and ABB Lummis\' </p><p>bid for government contracts, the GON\'s decision to go </p><p>against the technical committee\'s recommendation would create </p><p>the perception that the tendering process in Nigeria is not </p><p>transparent, and, in fact, would be construed as a bias </p><p>against companies from the United States.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>stressed to the Vice President how critical it is that the </p><p>GON avoid sending a signal to U.S. companies that Nigeria is </p><p>not a friendly place to conduct business.  The Vice President </p><p>responded that he also is anxious not to create the </p><p>impression that U.S. business investment is unwelcome in </p><p>Nigeria.  As a compromise approach, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>suggested that the contract be split regionally with Motorola </p><p>providing equipment for the southern half of the country and </p><p>Ericsson for the northern half.  The Vice President did not </p><p>respond directly, but left the idea on the table for further </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Vice President Abubakar claimed that the Minister of </p><p>Communications had signed the contract with Ericsson on July </p><p>10.  However, as of July 16, Motorola Nigeria representative </p><p>Raphael Udeogu asserted that although the Minister had signed </p><p>two related contracts with Siemens and Alcatel, the contract </p><p>with Ericsson had not yet been signed.  Udeogu reported that </p><p>Ericsson had not yet responded to the GON\'s contract offer at </p><p>Motorola\'s significantly lower bid price of USD 39.3 million </p><p>as compared with Ericsson\'s bid of USD 49 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Comment.  The fact that the President and Vice </p><p>President would believe allegations of corruption brought to </p><p>bear by Motorola\'s competitor without verifying their </p><p>accuracy leaves us questioning the efficacy and transparency </p><p>of the tendering process.  Nasir El-Rufai is a close Embassy </p><p>contact and has a reputation for honesty, fairness and </p><p>transparency, particularly in his official capacity as </p><p>overseer of the GON privatization program.  The Vice </p><p>President\'s claim that El-Rufai could have easily influenced </p><p>the technical committee\'s evaluation seemed to ignore the </p><p>fact that El-Rufai himself was not on the technical </p><p>committee.  Moreover, in his letter to the President, </p><p>El-Rufai strongly refuted Ericsson\'s allegations.  He also </p><p>described the involvement of the Vice President\'s </p><p>Aide-de-Campe who, El-Rufai says, attempted to influence the </p><p>Vice President and him in favor of Ericsson.  The Embassy is </p><p>unable to verify the accuracy of these statements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Comment Continued.  Ambassador Jeter will send letter </p><p>to President Obasanjo this week forwarding a Motorola </p><p>statement addressing Ericsson\'s allegations of impropriety. </p><p>The letter will request that the President reconsider </p><p>Motorola\'s disqualification, which we believe was based on </p><p>erroneous information.  Post will continue to advocate on </p><p>behalf of Motorola.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
