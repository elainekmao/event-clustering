<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 001323 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INR/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA SA/INS (CAMP, WALLER), </p><p>SA/PD (SCHWARTZ, BRENNIG, SCENSNY), SSA/PAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  "Mystery American" attends Sri Lankan </p><p>intelligence meetings, II </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Colombo 01273 </p><p> </p><p>1.  As reported in reftel, from 7/14 through 7/22 Sri Lankan </p><p>newspapers had a field day reporting that an AmCit -- a </p><p>"mysterious American" -- had participated in meetings of the GSL\'s </p><p>intelligence community.  Several dailies carried straightforward </p><p>coverage of the allegation.  Others treated the story as a </p><p>"cohabitation" saga, further evidence of the ongoing spat between </p><p>President Kumaratunga and the UNP government.  Still others </p><p>characterized the American\'s alleged presence as an anti-LTTE </p><p>plot. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The story has garnered additional attention since 7/22.  On </p><p>7/23, under the headline "Bug Them:  U.S. Spy Advisor," the </p><p>independent English DAILY MIRROR (7/23) reported in the style of </p><p>the NATIONAL ENQUIRER that "powerful sections in the Government </p><p>have requested security services to tap telephones of a few senior </p><p>government ministers and MPs in view of the unstable political </p><p>situation prevailing in the country....  It is learnt that </p><p>telephones of certain ministers are being tapped and a weekly </p><p>report is to be submitted which in turn is to be handed over to </p><p>[the] American advisor...." </p><p> </p><p>3.  The saga received a different spin on 7/29 when the ISLAND </p><p>(independent English daily) editorialized under the headline </p><p>"Gung-ho and the National Security Council."  The ISLAND\'s </p><p>positions:  one, "we do not know whether involvement of foreigners </p><p>could worsen or improve the past and present performances of the </p><p>[National Security] Council.  But the NSCs of the past have failed </p><p>to rise up to the challenges and brought disaster to this </p><p>country;" two, although it is feared that foreign presence will </p><p>lead to leaks, "this fear is unfounded because in our open mouthed </p><p>society ... secrets of the nation ... are leaked out ... by </p><p>officials in the council itself!" </p><p> </p><p>4.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>The fact that in about 25 years a rag-tag band of youth has been </p><p>able to resist the three professional armed services and the </p><p>police and build themselves up to a conventional army while </p><p>establishing a financial establishment stretching from Europe to </p><p>the Far East, including an international shipping line speaks </p><p>volumes of the failure of our military, defence and diplomatic </p><p>establishments of which the NSC is a key component. </p><p> </p><p>Internationally, it is apparent that either we did not have a </p><p>regular intelligence service, which was of absolute necessity with </p><p>the terrorist net spreading globally for the past two decades or </p><p>those whom we deployed for intelligence were of no use.  Nor have </p><p>we been able to liase effectively with intelligence services of </p><p>foreign nations which were much better informed about the </p><p>international terrorist activities of the LTTE.... </p><p> </p><p>The fear of having foreigners in sittings of the National Security </p><p>Council is that confidential information being leaked out. This </p><p>fear is unfounded because in our open mouthed society where the </p><p>secrets of the nation discussed in the National Security Council </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>are leaked out to the national press, quite obviously by officials </p><p>in the council itself! </p><p> </p><p>Officials who want to smear their predecessors or successors find </p><p>it quite convenient to leak information to damn their arch foes </p><p>irrespective of the damage it would do to the country. Arms </p><p>merchants could provide detailed reports of discussions of the </p><p>NSC. </p><p> </p><p>We do not know whether involvement of foreigners could worsen or </p><p>improve the past and present performances of the council. But the </p><p>NSCs of the past have failed to rise up to the challenges and </p><p>brought disaster to this country. </p><p> </p><p>All the gung-ho about foreigners being involved in intelligence </p><p>matters can be appreciated but the native sons have failed </p><p>miserably so far. The NSC has to be reconstituted and new defence </p><p>and intelligence strategies thought of. By whom is the question. </p><p> </p><p>5.  End excerpts. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
