<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001926 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, LI, SL, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: KOUYATE ON LIBERIA AND SIERRA LEONE </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary.  Ambassador met with ECOWAS Executive </p><p>Secretary Kouyate on July 27.  Kouyate indicated that the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>effort to organize Liberian opposition and civil society </p><p>leaders continues, and is intended as a precursor to a </p><p>meeting with Charles Taylor.  Careful steps need to be taken </p><p>to avoid division among these opposition figures, and liaison </p><p>with Presidents Kabbah and Conte is imperative.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador Jeter met with ECOWAS Executive Secretary </p><p>Lansana Kouyate in Abuja on July 27.   After initial </p><p>discussions on accreditation to the Secretariat of the </p><p>American Ambassador to Nigeria (septel), Kouyate spoke on </p><p>Liberia.  He said that he was soon to travel to Monrovia, </p><p>after a stop in Bamako to see President Konare.  When asked </p><p>the purpose of the meeting, Kouyate said that in part the </p><p>trip was to discuss the ongoing efforts to organize a meeting </p><p>of Liberian civil society and opposition figures with Charles </p><p>Taylor.  This would be preceded, he hastened to add, by a </p><p>meeting of these leaders, to seek a consensus position, and </p><p>avoid the divisions in opposition ranks that Taylor had </p><p>proved so skillful in exploiting  in the past.  Taylor, </p><p>Kouyate said, had already stated his willingness to talk, but </p><p>not share power, a position which Kouyate welcomed. </p><p>Power-sharing was a bad idea, Kouyate said, given Taylor\'s </p><p>proclivities toward division and double-dealing.  Kouyate </p><p>said he would also meet with opposition and civil society </p><p>leaders in Liberia, and seek additional names for the initial </p><p>list of attendees.  He would also liaise closely with </p><p>Presidents Kabbah and Conte to keep them informed of </p><p>developments and, he hoped, gain their support for the </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On Sierra Leone, Kouyate said that he thought that </p><p>the situation was "better," generally speaking, but there </p><p>were continuing tensions between the RUF and the Kamajors, </p><p>and he thought more effort needed to be paid to the DDR </p><p>process.  He said that UNSyG Annan had recently called and </p><p>asked for his views, and he had emphasized that the DDR </p><p>process was crucial to the peace process.  In response to </p><p>Ambassador\'s inquiry, Kouyate suggested that Sam Bockerie was </p><p>now in Angola, under Jonas Savimbi\'s protection.  He also </p><p>briefly mentioned new tensions between President Compaore of </p><p>Burkina Faso and Charles Taylor.  This was due, he said, to </p><p>Taylor\'s continuing ties to deposed Ivorien military ruler </p><p>General Robert Guei.  Compaore, Kouyate said, feels </p><p>"betrayed." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment.  Apparently hard at work on a meeting </p><p>between Charles Taylor and Liberian opposition and civil </p><p>society figures, Kouyate seemed well aware of the necessity </p><p>for a preparatory meeting among those leaders before any </p><p>discussions with Taylor, and the necessity as well of keeping </p><p>President Kabbah and President Conte firmly in the loop.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
