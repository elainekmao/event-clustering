<p>CONFIDENTIAL KABUL 3619 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 11652: GDS </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINT, AF, US </p><p>SUBJECT: FIRST CONVERSATION WITH NEW AFGHAN PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>1. MUR MOHAMHAD TARAKI, THE PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN\'S NEW </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND HE LIKES TO BE CALLED "MR. PRESIDENT," </p><p>RECEIVED ME ALONE IN HIS OFFICE AT THE OLD PRIME MINISTRY BUILDING </p><p>AT 5 P.M. ON MAY 6, I WAS RECEIVED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING </p><p>BY THE SAME CHIEF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF PROTOCOL WHO HAD SERVED THE </p><p>PREVIOUS REGIME. AS AN INDICATION OF THE TIMES, THE DEPUTY CHIEF, </p><p>WHO IS A MOHAMMADZAI, STARTED WEEPING WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS </p><p>FAMILY. IT WAS IN THIS MOOD THAT HE USHERED ME INTO HIS NEW CHIEF\'S </p><p>OFFICE. SECURITY PRECAUTIONS SEEMED TO BE MINIMAL, WITH ONLY ONE </p><p>ARMORED VEHICLE VISIBLE IN THE COMPOUND OF THE PRIME MINISTRY. </p><p> </p><p>2. TABAKI GREETED ME WITH A WARM HANDSHAKE AND A FRIENDLY SMILE, </p><p>DULY RECORDED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS. WE THEN SAT DOWN IN THE CORNER OF </p><p>HIS OFFICE AND EXCHANGED A FEW PLEASANTRIES WHILE OUR PICTURES </p><p>CONTINUED TO BE SNAPPED. I GOT A GOOD LAUGH FROM HIM WHEN I SAID I </p><p>WAS SORRY I HAD NOT MET HIM DURING MY FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN -- AND EVEN SORRIER DURING THE PAST NINE DAYS. TARAKI </p><p>SPOKE EXCELLENT, IF SOMEWHAT RUSTY, ENGLISH. </p><p> </p><p>3. TARAKI BEGAN HIS CONVERSATION BY RECOUNTING WITH OBVIOUS PRIDE </p><p>AND RELISH THE SUCCESS OF HIS REVOLUTION, STRESSING THAT IT IS A </p><p>REVOLUTION AND NOT A COUP. HE SAID ON THURSDAY, APRIL 27, THE TANKS </p><p>FIRST MOVED IN THE DIRECTION OF KABUL ABOUT 9 A.M., BUT TOOK MORE </p><p>THAN TWO HOURS TO REACH THE CENTER OF THE CITY. BY EVENING, THE </p><p>DAOUD REGIME HAD LOST THE BATTLE, ALTHOUGH THEY TRIED IN VAIN </p><p>DURING THE NIGHT TO SEND REINFORCEMENTS FROM CENTRAL CORPS </p><p>HEADQUARTERS AND FROM KARGHA. WITH THE COMING OF DAYLIGHT, HE SAID, </p><p>THE AIR FORCE WAS ABLE TO FINISH THE JOB. MEANWHILE, WITHIN THE </p><p>PALACE DAOUD HAD BEEN ASKED TO SURRENDER, BUT REFUSED, SHOT AT HIS </p><p>ATTACKERS, AS DID HIS WIFE AND FAMILY, AND WAS THEREFORE KILLED. </p><p>THE INTENTION, SAID TARAKI, HAD BEEN TO TAKE HIM AS A CAPTIVE. </p><p>TARAKI ADDED THAT DAOUD PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN COURT-MARTIALED </p><p>AND POSSIBLY SHOT. TARAKI HAD YESTERDAY  </p><p>THE SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN SHOT BY DAOUD\'S "WHITE PISTOL". </p><p> </p><p>4. TARAKI THEN SAID HE WAS SURPRISED THAT I HAD NOT BEEN THE FIRST </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO CALL ON HIM, BECAUSE WHAT HE IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN IS A "GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR </p><p>THE PEOPLE." CORRECTING HIMSELF A BIT, HE SAID HE HAD ASKED THE SAME </p><p>QUESTION OF THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR BECAUSE PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN </p><p>HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON, CULTURALLY AND ETHNICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>5. I THEN EXPLAINED THAT IN CASES LIKE THIS, WE DO NOT EXTEND FORMAL </p><p>RECOGNITION BUT INDICATE, AS WE HAVE DONE, THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE </p><p>NORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. I SAID, IN FACT, WE HOPE TO HAVE CLOSE </p><p>WORKING RELATIONS WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT. I ADDED, AS OUR NOTE </p><p>STATED, THAT I HOPE HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE SOON TO </p><p>AFFIRM THE VALIDITY OF EXISTING TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS. HE MAD NO </p><p>COMMENT ON THAT SUGGESTION. </p><p> </p><p>6. AT SEVERAL POINTS DURING THESE PRELIMINARY EXCHANGES, TARAKI </p><p>REFERRED TO THE TIME HE HAD SPENT IN THE UNITED STATES, HIS </p><p>FRIENDSHIP FOR AMERICANS, AND HIS LIKING FOR THE AMERICAN QUALITY OF </p><p>FRANKNESS. WE AGREED THAT AFGHANS AND AMERICANS HAVE LOTS IN COMMON </p><p>IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>7. I THEN STATED I WANTED TO BE FRANK WITH HIM. I SAID THAT, AS HE </p><p>KNEW, THE UNITED STATES HAD NEVER SOUGHT ANY STRATEGIC OR POLITICAL </p><p>ADVANTAGE FROM AFGHANISTAN. HE AGREED. I SAID THAT ONE OF THE CARDINAL </p><p>POINTS OF OUR POLICY IS TO HELP AFGHANISTAN MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE, </p><p>ITS INTEGRITY, AND ITS NATIONAL IDENTITY. HE NODDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. </p><p>I SAID THAT SINCE THE BRITISH LEFT INDIA, IT WAS OUR VIEW THAT THE </p><p>ONLY COUNTRY THAT COULD POSSIBLY THREATEN AFGHANISTAN\'S INDEPENDENCE </p><p>IS THE SOVIET UNION. IN PAST TIMES, I NOTED, OUR POLICY HAD BEEN TO </p><p>TRY TO CONSTRUCT BLOCS AGAINST SOVIET EXPANSIONISM, BUT THAT OUR </p><p>APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM HAD, IN THE COURSE OF TIME BECOME MORE </p><p>SOPHISTICATED. </p><p> </p><p>I STATED WE COULD READILY UNDERSTAND -- GIVEN AFGHANISTAN\'S </p><p>GEOGRAPHIC POSITION AND ECONOMIC NEEDS -- WHY IT WOULD WANT A CLOSE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOVIET UNION. BUT, I SAID, WE WOULD BE DISTURBED </p><p>IF AFGHANISTAN\'S FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICIES WERE TO BECOME </p><p>INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THOSE OF THE SOVIET UNION BECAUSE THAT WOULD </p><p>OBLITERATE AFGHANISTAN\'S NATIONAL IDENTITY AND WOULD GIVE RISE TO </p><p>TENSIONS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WHICH COULD THREATEN PEACE. I SAID </p><p>THAT IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT WE APPRECIATE AFGHANISTAN\'S NONALIGNED </p><p>POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>8. IN RESPONSE, TARAKI AFFIRMED THAT AFGHANISTAN IS AND DESIRES TO </p><p>REMAIN AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY AND MASTER OF ITS OWN DESTINY. HE SAID HE </p><p>WAS PLEASED THAT THE UNITED STATES TAKES A MORE FLEXIBLE VIEW OF THE </p><p>WORLD AND ADMITS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IT MADE A MISTAKE IN VIETNAM. HE </p><p>REFERRED TO HIS BEING IN WASHINGTON DURING THE DAYS OF SENATOR MCCARTHY, </p><p>AND NOTED THAT THE THEN VICE PRESIDENT NIXON HAD REFUSED ONCE TO COME </p><p>TO AN AFGHAN EMBASSY RECEPTION BECAUSE AFGHANISTAN WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION. HE WAS PLEASED THAT THAT IS NO LONGER THE APPROACH THE </p><p>UNITED STATES TAKES TOWARD HIS COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>9. I THEN SAID THAT IN EVALUATING THE POLICIES OF A GOVERNMENT IN A </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE AFGHANISTAN, THE UNITED STATES WOULD LOOK FIRST </p><p>AND FOREMOST AT WHAT THAT GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF </p><p>LIVING OF ITS PEOPLE AND TO ASSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS -- </p><p>ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND LEGAL. AT THIS POINT, TARAKI BECAME </p><p>MUCH MORE ANIMATED AND HELD FORTH AT SOME LENGTH ON THE SUBJECT OF HOW </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT WANTS TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID THAT HE </p><p>AND HIS COLLEAGUES -- UNLIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, REALLY CARE ABOUT THE </p><p>POOR PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN PUTTING MONEY IN </p><p>SWISS BANKS. HE SAID THAT IN JUDGING HIS GOVERNMENT\'S POLICIES, WE </p><p>SHOULD ASK THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN WHETHER THEY THINK THEY ARE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL. IN THE PAST, HE BELIEVED FOREIGNERS TENDED TO ASK THE </p><p>ARISTOCRATS WHO, OF COURSE, WERE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING THE POOR </p><p>BECAUSE SUCH A POLICY WOULD THREATEN THEIR OWN PROSPERITY. REGARDING </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS, TARAKI SAID THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEM AND THAT </p><p>EACH NATION MUST JUDGE FOR ITSELF THE KIND OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE MOST </p><p>SUITED TO ITS OWN SITUATION AND CULTURE. HE MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT </p><p>HE WOULD NOT WANT US TO MAKE VALUE JUDGEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT </p><p>TO INTERFERENCE IN AFGHANISTAN\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. I ASSURED HIM THAT </p><p>THE UNITED STATES HAD NO DESIRE TO TRY TO TRANSPLANT ITS GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>SYSTEM ELSEWHERE, BUT THAT WE, NEVERTHELESS, CARE DEEPLY ABOUT HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>10. TARAKI THEN SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD JUDGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS BY </p><p>THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HELP AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMULATED, BUT THAT HE </p><p>WOULD BE ASKING US FOR ASSISTANCE AS, INDEED, HE WOULD BE ASKING THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES. HE SAID THAT THE PRINCIPAL SLOGAN, </p><p>ADDING THAT HE REALLY MEANT POLICY AND NOT SLOGAN, OF HIS GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>TO PROVIDE BREAD, CLOTHING, AND SHELTER FOR THE MASSES. I DESCRIBED OUR </p><p>AID PROGRAM OF RECENT YEARS AND ITS EMPHASIS ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND </p><p>AGRICULTURE FOR THE RURAL POOR. HE SAID HE WOULD TELL ME, AS HE HAD </p><p>TOLD THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR, THAT OUR RESPECTIVE AID PFORAMS HAD FAILED, </p><p>AND THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMITMENT OF THE PREVIOUS </p><p>REGIME. I SAID I AGREED WITH HIM THAT OUR AID PROGRAM HAD NOT ACHIEVED </p><p>ITS GOALS. HE ASKED ME WHY. I REPLIED THAT HE KNEW HIS OWN COUNTRY </p><p>BETTER THAN I, AND THAT I WOULD MERELY SAY THAT THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT </p><p>WAS NOT CAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT WE WISHED TO </p><p>SEE IMPLEMENTED. HE OBVIOUSLY TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN MY SAYING THIS. </p><p> </p><p>11. TARAKI THEN SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE </p><p>MEANT BY "BREAD". HE SAID HE WANTS TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF </p><p>AFGHANS WHO HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY TO WORK IN IGNOMINY ABROAD. THIS WILL </p><p>MEAN THE CONSTRUCTION OF INDUSTRY AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND HE HOPED WE </p><p>WOULD HELP WITH THAT. I TOLD HIM THAT ONCE THE APPROPRIATE MINISTERS IN </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT WERE PREPARED TO DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS WITH US, MY AID </p><p>MISSION DIRECTOR AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>12. I THEN SAID THAT ONE OTHER MATTER OF IMPORTANCE TO THE UNITED </p><p>STATES IS THE STABILITY OF THIS REGION IN THE WORLD. I SAID WE HAVE BEEN </p><p>DELIGHTED AT THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS IN </p><p>DEVELOPING REGIONAL COOPERATION. TARAKI SAID THAT THAT WAS, OF COURSE, </p><p>A MATTER THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD BE STUDYING. HE ALSO SAID THAT WHEN </p><p>ONE TALKS OF REGIONAL COOPERATION, THAT MEANS NOT ONLY COOPERATION WITH </p><p>INDIA, PAKISTAN, AND IRAN -- BUT ALSO WITH THE SOVIET UNION. </p><p> </p><p>13. THE CONVERSATION ENDED WITH PLEASANTRIES AS IT HAD BEGUN. HE SAID </p><p>THAT HE HOPED THE SOVIET UNION WOULD NOT JUDGE HIM BADLY IF HE BUILT MORE </p><p>MOSQUES. BY THE SAME TOKEN, HE HOPED WE WOULD NOT JUDGE HIM BADLY IF HE, </p><p>HIMSELF, DID NOT GO TO A MOSQUE. HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT EVERYTHING </p><p>HE HAD TOLD ME HE HAD ALSO TOLD THE SOVIET UNION. </p><p> </p><p>14. COMMENT:  TARAKI IS A SLIM, WHITE-HAIRED, PROFESSIONAL MAN WHO LOOKS </p><p>SOMEWHAT OLDER THAN 61. HE HAS THE CHAN AND EMPATHY THAT ONE LEARNS TO </p><p>ASSOCIATE WITH AFGHANS. HE IS ALSO CLEARLY HARDHEADED AND EXHILARATED BY </p><p>HIS SUCCESS. WHEN HE IS PARTICULARLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A POINT HE IS </p><p>MAKING, HIS EYES ASSUME A FIERCE, INTENSITY. OUR CONVERSATION WAS </p><p>EXTREMELY CORDIAL AND WAS ALSO, I THINK, A REAL DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>ELIOT </p><p></p></div>
