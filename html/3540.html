<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004719 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IZ, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: A STEP FORWARD ON IRAQ, BUT ELECTIONS POSTPONED </p><p>UNTIL SPRING 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. FBIS GMP20020815000167 B. AMMAN 04526 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) King Abdullah\'s televised speech on August 15 carried </p><p>few surprises.  As expected, he announced the postponement of </p><p>elections until "the spring."  The King also said that </p><p>responsibility for the future of Palestine and Iraq lies with </p><p>their respective leaderships.  Most Embassy contacts had few </p><p>words of praise for the speech, and focused on the </p><p>postponement of elections.  However, it is important to note </p><p>that the King\'s remarks about the responsibility of the Iraqi </p><p>leadership is a welcome change from his comments to the press </p><p>in London three weeks ago.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>NUANCE ON PALESTINE, IRAQ, NO SUPRISE ON ELECTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) King Abdullah addressed the nation on August 15 in a </p><p>speech (see Ref A) that was carried on Jordan television and </p><p>the Lebanese satellite station MBC.  The King reaffirmed that </p><p>Jordan considers the PA the only legitimate leadership of the </p><p>Palestinian people and that the Palestinian people are the </p><p>only ones who can choose their leaders.  At the same time, </p><p>the King frankly and unapologetically defended Jordan\'s </p><p>relations with Israel as good both for Jordan and the </p><p>Palestinians.  He also indirectly criticized Palestinian </p><p>leaders, saying "the Palestinian leadership (must) shoulder </p><p>its responsibilities before its people, the Arab nation, and </p><p>the world."  The King devoted little time in his speech to </p><p>Iraq (less than a minute of his 25 minute remarks), calling </p><p>"for resolving the Iraqi issue through dialogue with the </p><p>United Nations rather than the threat of force or the use of </p><p>force...however, at the end of the day, it is the Iraqi </p><p>leadership which has to make its decision.  It will be </p><p>responsible for this decision before its people, its nation, </p><p>and the world at large."  At the end of the speech, the King </p><p>focused on Jordan\'s domestic politics and, to the surprise of </p><p>no one, announced that legislative elections would be pushed </p><p>back until Spring so the elections would not be influenced by </p><p>regional events. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>JORDANIANS UNDERWHELMED </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A sampling of Embassy contacts indicates that most </p><p>Jordanians heard little new in the King\'s speech.  Most </p><p>contacts believed the King did not waver from previous </p><p>positions on the Palestinian issue.  An East Bank businessman </p><p>believed much of the King\'s rhetoric on the Palestinian issue </p><p>was in response to the accusations make on the Al-Jazeera </p><p>program, "Opposite Direction" (see Ref B).  The contact </p><p>opined that the King\'s emphasis on Jordanian solidarity with </p><p>the Palestinian people was intended to counter accusations </p><p>made on the show that King Hussein had betrayed the </p><p>Palestinian cause.   Another East Bank contact who was </p><p>formerly a member of the Muslim Brotherhood believed the </p><p>speech\'s emphatic rejection of a "Jordanian option" for the </p><p>Palestinians signaled a change in Jordanian policy--away from </p><p>considering the Palestinian cause an internal issue.  "The </p><p>King seemed to be saying that the Palestinian cause is a </p><p>regional issue not a domestic one." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In contrast to the media blitz of the last month, the </p><p>King said relatively little about Iraq and few contacts noted </p><p>the Iraqi aspect of his speech.  However, one East Bank </p><p>contact said that he thought the speech was "straightforward, </p><p>even bold, in putting the responsibility on the Iraqi </p><p>leadership." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) At the end of the speech, the King made the </p><p>announcement that he had been telegraphing for weeks -- that </p><p>Parliamentary elections would be postponed until Spring.  The </p><p>King argued that elections should be postponed so that "these </p><p>elections be free and fair and far from the influence of the </p><p>conditions facing the region".  Reaction to the postponement </p><p>among our contacts has split along East Bank-West Bank lines. </p><p> East Bankers generally favored the postponement, while </p><p>Palestinians were critical, but many agreed that elections </p><p>are likely to be delayed further, at least until next Fall. </p><p>Former Prime Minister Tahir al-Masri told Poloff that the </p><p>issue of elections spoiled the entire speech.  Al-Masri said </p><p>that the Palestinian issue will delay elections now, and </p><p>confidently predicted that "the U.S. invasion of Iraq will </p><p>force a delay again in the Spring."  The Islamic Action Front </p><p>(IAF) issued a public statement calling the postponement </p><p>"unconstitutional" and added that "postponements will open </p><p>the way for more postponements." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>TIMING OF SPEECH: LONG OVERDUE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  While the King\'s rhetorical skills and command of </p><p>formal Arabic continue to improve, many Jordanians believe </p><p>the King should address his people more frequently, in light </p><p>of all the difficult issues facing Jordan.  One intellectual </p><p>told Polfsn that "the speech was part of the King\'s </p><p>checklist: socks, pants, speech, raincoat, etc...he zipped </p><p>his suitcase and off he went--people didn\'t even know he was </p><p>in town, let alone that he had a speech to give!"  One East </p><p>Bank contact said that the King should have delivered the </p><p>speech a long time ago. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The King\'s address was an attempt to reassure </p><p>Jordanians that he understands their frustrations and </p><p>concerns.  The King\'s clear statements that the Palestinian </p><p>and Iraqi leaderships bear ultimate responsibility for the </p><p>fate of their peoples -- a sentiment rarely heard here amid </p><p>speculation of U.S.-led conspiracies -- are welcome.  The </p><p>language on Iraq was much more nuanced than the King\'s </p><p>remarks to the British press three weeks ago.  Senior </p><p>officials have told the Ambassador that this speech was the </p><p>first step in repositioning the GOJ\'s position on Iraq.  He </p><p>was told that the public line would slowly move the focus to </p><p>Iraq\'s responsbilities under UN resolutions. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The postponement of elections was no surprise -- the </p><p>King and government have been telegraphing this punch for </p><p>several months.  The security arguments proved paramount. </p><p>However, on elections as on other human rights issues, we </p><p>believe we should continue to press the Jordanians to open </p><p>the political system as they have liberalized the economic </p><p>system over the last three years. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
