(SBU)  Summary: The case history of Niger Dock, the first </p><p>such privatization to feature an American firm, highlights </p><p>the internal GON rivalries and other obstacles that </p><p>privatization faces in Nigeria.   Just when the issue seemed </p><p>settled, and  J. Raymond McDermott, Inc. (JRM),  had won the </p><p>Niger Dock bid with Global Electric Corporation, a new fly </p><p>flew into the ointment as JRM withdrew its promise to become </p><p>an equity partner.  The latest developments of that situation </p><p>will be dealt with in detail in a separate cable.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Privatization Gameplan for Niger Dock </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  When the GON rolled out its initial privatization </p><p>plan in 1998, the government\'s sole shipbuilding company </p><p>Niger Dock Nigeria, Ltd. was among the companies slated for </p><p>privatization during Phase II of the Bureau of Public </p><p>Enterprise\'s anticipated privatization program.  Established </p><p>in 1986 by the GON as Nigeria\'s preeminent shipbuilding and </p><p>ship repair facility, Niger Dock had become a leading West </p><p>African shipbuilder.  However, its fortunes degenerated </p><p>dramatically as a result of chronic mismanagement.  Still, </p><p>many observers believe a privatized Niger Dock can return to </p><p>form. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Despite numerous hiccups, Phase II remains on </p><p>track.  Yet Niger Dock\'s own privatization has not failed to </p><p>generate extensive internal divisions within the GON, which </p><p>in turn has transmitted diverse and confusing signals to </p><p>potential investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>High Drama Trails the Privatization Bid </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Niger Dock\'s privatization has been dogged by high </p><p>drama among the various GON agencies involved in its </p><p>privatization.  On October 25, 2001 the BPE published the Bid </p><p>Evaluation Criteria on approval by the National Council on </p><p>Privatization (NCP.) According to the BPE privatization plan, </p><p>the tender winner will own 51 percent of the company, the GON </p><p>will retain 20 percent, while the remaining 29 percent would </p><p>be sold to the general public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  On October 31, just days before the final winner </p><p>was to be announced, Nigerdock management -- also a bid </p><p>contender as part of the Navimor International/Stolt Offshore </p><p>joint venture -- withdrew its 2000 audited accounts already </p><p>submitted to the BPE, claiming errors had been spotted in the </p><p>audited accounts. Some observers viewed this  development as </p><p>a ploy to delay the bid opening since Navimor International </p><p>had privately indicated its intention to withdraw from the </p><p>bid. The National Council for Privatization (NCP) authorized </p><p>the BPE to go ahead with the bid awards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Undeterred, BPE went ahead with the bid round since </p><p>Global Energy Company/J. Ray McDermott, as well as Stolt </p><p>Offshore, expressed willingness to continue with the bid.  In </p><p>support, the NCP ruled in favor of BPE and gave its nod to </p><p>commence the bidding. Six serious contenders, including West </p><p>African Shipyards Limited/Spring Fountain (a Niger Dock </p><p>Management Buyout); Navimor International/Stolt offshore; and </p><p>Global Energy Company(GEC)/J. Ray McDermott, submitted </p><p>financial bids. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  When bids were opened November 9, the Global </p><p>Energy Company (a Nigerian oil and gas firm)/J. Ray </p><p>MacDermott partnership was the winner with a bid of N3.4 </p><p>billion (USD 32 million).  According to BPE advisors, the </p><p>only other serious contender was Stolt/Navimor who had </p><p>virtually withdrawn its bid between the first and second </p><p>rounds.  The only reason Stolt maintained its bid, according </p><p>to the BPE advisor, was because McDermott\'s bid remained </p><p>higher than its own.  The reasons behind Stolt\'s disinterest </p><p>are not known. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Almost immediately after the award was announced, </p><p>Transport Minister Ojo Maduekwe sought to reverse the bid </p><p>process.  Under his name, advertisements were placed in the </p><p>local press claiming that since Niger Dock was under probe by </p><p>a judicial commission, privatization of the company could not </p><p>proceed. (In 2000, President Obasanjo had set up a judicial </p><p>commission to look into the affairs of the company since </p><p>2000.  This led to the dissolution of its previous board and </p><p>the suspension of Niger Dock\'s previous Chief Executive.) </p><p>BPE challenged the Minister\'s assertion.  BPE\'s helmsman </p><p>Nasir El-Rufai postulated that since the Judicial Commission </p><p>was looking only into past activities, their findings in no </p><p>way could corrupt the privatization process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>McDermott Stands Down on Niger Dock, at Least for Now </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Enter another fly into the Niger Dock ointment. On </p><p>November 20, el-Rufai briefed Ambassador Jeter on the </p><p>decision of J. Ray McDermott not to commit equity </p><p>participation with GEC at this time, a message crafted on </p><p>November 8 but undelivered to the BPE until after the bid </p><p>award had been announced.  In its message to GEC, McDermott </p><p>indicated it agreed to remain a technical partner and provide </p><p>capital equipment for Niger Dock capacity improvements. </p><p>McDermott also kept the door open for increasing its </p><p>participation in the near future. The BPE chief believed the </p><p>complexion of the GEC/McDermott bid had been altered </p><p>substantially by the McDermott decision.  He feared this late </p><p>change in the partnership arrangement jeopardized the entire </p><p>Niger Dock bid process, and would give the upper hand to </p><p>those who did not want Niger Dock privatization to proceed. </p><p>(For more detail on the Ambassador\'s meeting with el-Rufai, </p><p>see septel.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU)  McDermott management confirmed to USDOC that </p><p>although the company still had a strong interest in Nigerdock </p><p>and was committed to provide significant technical and </p><p>infrastructure support, corporate approvals for providing a </p><p>50/50 equity split with GEC for the project had not yet been </p><p>forthcoming. Such technical participation, McDermott </p><p>believed, was allowed under the draft sales and purchase </p><p>agreement between GEC and the GON. GEC had already secured </p><p>bank financing. And corporate buy-in at some level up to 50 </p><p>percent could be obtained as early as the first quarter of </p><p>2002. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
