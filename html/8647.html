<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003461 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON ISRAELI ASSASSINATION </p><p>ATTEMPT AGAINST HAMAS\' RANTISI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, June 11, highlights </p><p>Israel\'s failed assassination attempt against the life </p><p>of Hamas leader Abdul Aziz Rantisi in Gaza yesterday. </p><p>Some reports feature President Bush\'s reaction to the </p><p>attempt; while all reports featured the Palestinian </p><p>Authority\'s denunciation of the assassination attempt </p><p>and Hamas\' "promise" to retaliate. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "An attempt to assassinate Rantisi or the peace </p><p>efforts?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mohammad Amayreh writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(06/11):  "Right from the beginning, we said that it </p><p>is difficult to be reassured by Sharon\'s promises or </p><p>by his intentions towards implementing the roadmap. </p><p>The Israeli army, yesterday, tried to assassinate one </p><p>of the Hamas leaders in Gaza.  This assassination </p><p>attempt, for which Israeli helicopters were used, was </p><p>undoubtedly sanctioned by Sharon.  Even though the </p><p>Israeli government categorizes this attempt as part of </p><p>combating terrorism, the outcome contradicts </p><p>everything that was agreed upon, including the truce </p><p>or ceasefire agreement and the promise to grant the </p><p>Palestinian prime minister the opportunity to deal </p><p>with the Palestinian factions to try to convince them </p><p>to stop the so-called `violence\'.  This assassination </p><p>attempt, which is not the first of its kind, </p><p>constitutes a clear Israeli effort to impede the </p><p>implementation of the roadmap.  It is a crime to be </p><p>added to Sharon\'s already full record of bloody crimes </p><p>against the Palestinian people and their combatant </p><p>forces." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Assassinating Rantisi or Abu Mazen?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(06/11):  "Why would Sharon put Abu Mazen in this </p><p>corner?  Why would he want to abort Abu Mazen\'s </p><p>mission and not allow him the chance to do the </p><p>necessary on the part of the Palestinians to fulfill </p><p>the roadmap?  The issue therefore is not an issue of </p><p>searching for security, stability and calm.  Rather, </p><p>the Israeli right-wing is trying to impose their own </p><p>vision and conditions in order to eliminate the pulse </p><p>of the Palestinians and to destroy the infrastructure </p><p>of the Palestinian resistance, leading to uprooting </p><p>the Palestinian people." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Palestinian struggle is not a charitable </p><p>organization!" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(06/11):  "The assassination attempt against the life </p><p>of Hamas leader Abdul Aziz Rantisi in Gaza yesterday </p><p>shows once more that the problem in the Middle East is </p><p>not the `terrorism\' of the Palestinians, but the </p><p>terrorism of the Israeli state.  The American </p><p>complicity in these assassinations perpetrated by the </p><p>Sharon government, when Palestinian resistance </p><p>operations are looked upon as terrorism and aggression </p><p>is regrettable and degrading.  Sharon\'s criminal act </p><p>in Gaza, and not Hamas\' rejection of dialogue with Abu </p><p>Mazen, is the indication of the future that awaits the </p><p>roadmap.  The extremist Israeli government is going to </p><p>take advantage of the roadmap to escalate its </p><p>provocations and aggression against the Palestinian </p><p>people.  Israel is the one that is encouraging </p><p>violence, pouring oil on an already raging fire every </p><p>time there is a sign of hope for getting out of the </p><p>vicious circle of killing and destruction.  Sharon\'s </p><p>operation yesterday must not be a reason to stop or </p><p>suspend dialogue among the Palestinians.  If there are </p><p>any priorities on the Palestinian agenda now, </p><p>maintaining the Palestinian national unity should be </p><p>top of that priority list..  If there is to be a </p><p>Palestinian political response to the assassination </p><p>attempt, it should that which stresses the Palestinian </p><p>dialogue and emphasizes the option of resistance, </p><p>because the resistance is the main card that the </p><p>Palestinians have as long as the occupation exists.. </p><p>The criminal Gaza operation shows that Sharon views </p><p>the roadmap as a means to ignite Palestinian civil </p><p>war, nothing more and nothing less." </p><p>-- "Attempting to assassinate the roadmap" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/11):  "Israel\'s assassination attempt against </p><p>Abdul Aziz Rantisi was nothing but an attempt to abort </p><p>the roadmap and this opportunity to achieve just and </p><p>lasting peace..  Israel would not have gone this far </p><p>in its insane war against the Palestinian people and </p><p>in its bloody targeting of the peace process and with </p><p>it Palestinian rights and lives, had it not been for </p><p>America\'s silence about these crimes and the </p><p>encouragement that the extremist and blood-thirsty </p><p>right-wing Israelis receive from the U.S. </p><p>administration.  Washington placed the war criminal on </p><p>a pedestal, and it is up to it alone to bring him down </p><p>from it, if it really wants to give peace a chance." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Who blames Sharon?" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (06/11) editorializes:  "It just does not </p><p>sink in with Ariel Sharon that violence breeds </p><p>violence.  Hamas is indeed an obstacle to both the </p><p>implementation of the roadmap and prospects for peace </p><p>and stability in the entire region.  But bombing </p><p>Gaza\'s residential and most densely populated areas, </p><p>killing three innocent Palestinians and injuring </p><p>scores of people in an attempt to take the life of one </p><p>of Hamas\' most popular leaders is only going to </p><p>undermine, not help, the cause of peace.  It would be </p><p>no exaggeration to say that no one is more eager than </p><p>the Palestinian National Authority to see Hamas </p><p>relegated to the fringes of Palestinian politics.  But </p><p>political assassinations or attempts on the life of </p><p>leaders such as Abdul Aziz Rantisi only strengthen </p><p>Hamas and play in the hands of extremist groups.. </p><p>This umpteenth episode of Israeli state terrorism is </p><p>bound to be echoed by more terrorist operations by </p><p>Hamas.  The circle of violence has been activated. </p><p>What was a truce has ended in another terrible </p><p>military escalation against Palestinian civilians.. </p><p>For peace to get a chance, at some point, someone will </p><p>have to put the blame where it belongs." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
