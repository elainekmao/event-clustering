TOM MCDONALD.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04536  161606Z </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD SPOKE TO ZIMBABWE </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY FOR AFRICA DAVID HAMADZIRIPI ON AUGUST </p><p>15 ABOUT HARARE\'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE PROCEEDINGS AND </p><p>OUTCOME OF THE LUSAKA DROC SUMMIT.  HAMADZIRIPI, WHO </p><p>HAD JUST RETURNED FROM LUSAKA, WHERE HE WAS STAFFING </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE AND FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS </p><p>MUDENGE, TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE MEETING WENT </p><p>QUITE WELL.   THE UNDERSECRETARY SAID THE LUSAKA </p><p>ACCORDS ARE ALIVE AND WELL AND THAT ALL THE PARTIES </p><p>INVOLVED RECOMMITTED THEMSELVES TO THEM.   ALTHOUGH </p><p>PRESIDENT KABILA WAS THE ONLY HEAD OF STATE NOT IN </p><p>AGREEMENT ON THE PATH FORWARD, HAMADZIRIPI DID NOT </p><p>CHARACTERIZE KABILA AS BEING OSTRACIZED BY THE OTHER </p><p>HEADS OF STATE AT THE SUMMIT.  THE UNDERSECRETARY </p><p>NOTED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE WAS GENERALLY POSITIVE AND </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE.  ZIMBABWE, IN PARTICULAR, WAS PLEASED </p><p>WITH RWANDA\'S PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW 200 KILOMETERS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DESPITE THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN KABILA\'S AGREEMENT </p><p>ON MASIRE AS FACILITATOR AND PROBLEMS RELATED TO MONUC </p><p>DEPLOYMENT, ZIMBABWE IS HOPEFUL THAT MOMENTUM WILL </p><p>BUILD FROM THE SUMMIT.  HAMADZIRIPI TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT MUSEVENI AND MUGABE WILL HAVE A CHANCE </p><p>TO DISCUSS THE MASIRE IMPASSE AND OTHER ISSUES AT THE </p><p>SADC SMART PARTNERSHIP MEETING STARTING IN MAPUTO THIS </p><p>WEEKEND AND CONTINUING INTO NEXT WEEK.   AT THE </p><p>SUMMIT, THE PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED BRINGING IN ONE TO </p><p>THREE INDIVIDUALS TO ASSIST MASIRE, AND NAMES WERE </p><p>MENTIONED, ACCORDING TO HAMADZIRIPI, BUT HE DID NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04536  161606Z </p><p>SHARE ANY NAMES WITH THE AMBASSADOR.  HE ALSO NOTED </p><p>THAT AS A RESULT OF THE SUMMIT, DEFENSE CHIEFS WILL </p><p>MEET NEXT WEEK TO FOLLOW UP ON DETAILS OF </p><p>DISENGAGEMENT.  THE REBEL GROUPS AND THE KABILA </p><p>GOVERNMENT, FOR THEIR PART, ARE DUE TO MEET SOON TO </p><p>DISCUSS MODALITIES.  REGARDING MONUC ISSUES, FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER MUDENGE WILL CHAIR A POLITICAL COMMITTEE </p><p>MEETING IN THE NEAR TERM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT:  ZIMBABWE\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY IS UPBEAT </p><p>ABOUT REVIVING THE LUSAKA ACCORDS AND CREATING THE </p><p>CONDITIONS TO EXPAND THE MONUC PRESENCE.  THIS LIKELY </p><p>HAS MORE TO DO WITH MUGABE\'S PERENNIAL HOPE THAT HE </p><p>CAN BRING HOME THE TROOPS THAT CONTINUE TO DRAIN THE </p><p>TREASURY AND PROVIDE A LIGHTNING ROD FOR OPPOSITION </p><p>CRITICISM THAN ANY BREAKTHROUGH IN LUSAKA.  ZIMBABWE </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO DISENGAGE FROM THE </p><p>CONGO WITHOUT A FACE-COSTING UNILATERAL WITHDRAWAL. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
