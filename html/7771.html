<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001063 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL/AAE; EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SNAR, SOCI, PGOV, ETRD, ECON, EAID, LA, VM, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  NAM CAN BORDER OPEN FOR BUSINESS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  Hanoi 1043   B.  02 Hanoi 2889 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  The Vietnam - Laos Nam Can border </p><p>crossing in Nghe An province opened to foreigners  in </p><p>January 2003.  There appears to be a frenzy of building </p><p>activity in and around the border, but cross border traffic </p><p>remains modest.  Smuggling of drugs and other contraband in </p><p>the border area remains a chronic problem.  Vietnamese and </p><p>Lao border forces coordinate regularly and there have been </p><p>small drug seizures based on cross border cooperation.  With </p><p>the border crossing internationalized, tourist development </p><p>will be more possible.  Ref a covered the United Nations </p><p>Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Ky Son project.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  During a monitoring trip to UNODC\'s Ky Son project </p><p>April 21 - 24, poloff and pol FSN visited the Nam Can border </p><p>crossing at the end of National Highway 7 in Ky Son </p><p>district.  From Mung Xem, the district capital, it is about </p><p>15 miles to the border over a winding, hilly, but reasonably </p><p>well-paved road. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>FOREIGNERS CAN CROSS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Nguyen Cong Dong, head of the Nam Can border unit, </p><p>confirmed that the Nam Can border crossing is now open to </p><p>foreigners.  Dong said that this plan had been in the works </p><p>"for a couple years" and that it is part of the GVN\'s </p><p>overall plan to upgrade border crossings between Vietnam and </p><p>Laos. (Note:  ref b reported on the Cau Treo border crossing </p><p>on Highway 9 in Ha Tinh province and the Lao Bao crossing on </p><p>Highway 8 in Quang Tri province.  End note.)  The crossing </p><p>at Nam Can is relatively far from any significant population </p><p>center; Vinh, a large city along the main north-south </p><p>Highway 1, and its companion port at Cua Lo, are about a six- </p><p>hour drive to the east. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The Nam Can crossing remains little known and there </p><p>has been little, if any, official coverage of this decision </p><p>to internationalize it.  Dong estimated that, since Nam </p><p>Can\'s opening to foreigners, "about 100 people from 15 to 20 </p><p>different countries" have crossed, using various modes of </p><p>transportation.  He recalled a small group of foreigners </p><p>even crossing on bicycles.  He predicted that, once the </p><p>border crossing is better known, the numbers will "increase </p><p>substantially." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>MUCH CONSTRUCTION, MODEST TRAFFIC </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  There appears to be a large amount of construction </p><p>activity around the border area, mostly in initial stages. </p><p>The last section of the main road is being upgraded and a </p><p>large area adjacent to the road is being leveled.  Dong </p><p>claimed that he was not sure what the construction plans </p><p>are, but he guessed that "most likely" there would be </p><p>trading center, post office, bank, and hotel built "within </p><p>the next five to ten years."  Dong said that as far as he </p><p>knew, the GVN had not yet declared the area a "border </p><p>economic zone" as it has in other Vietnam - Lao crossings </p><p>(ref b), but he predicted the area would be so designated </p><p>"in the near future." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Locals from both sides of the border may cross </p><p>freely with permits from the relevant authorities.  They may </p><p>even stay on the other side for up to 10 days, but must </p><p>report to the local police, Dong added.  He noted that many </p><p>residents (mostly Hmong) have relatives on both sides of the </p><p>border and that villages and towns on the Lao side are </p><p>"quite similar" to those in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Cross border traffic is still modest, according to </p><p>Dong.  He estimated that about 70 - 100 vehicles cross </p><p>daily, but the traffic is not steady.  During the two hours </p><p>poloffs were in the area, there was little activity on </p><p>either side and no vehicles crossed.  Dong predicted that </p><p>tourist development in Ky Son would now be more possible </p><p>with an international border and that more tourist </p><p>guesthouses would go up in Mung Xen "within the next couple </p><p>years."  (There are currently only two.)  He also noted that </p><p>the UN project is helping to raise living standards in the </p><p>area and "should lead to more trade." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>SMUGGLING - A CHRONIC PROBLEM </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Smuggling of drugs and other contraband remains a </p><p>major problem along the Lao - Vietnam border, including at </p><p>Nam Can.  Dong admitted that "significant amounts" of </p><p>narcotics are entering Vietnam from the Lao side, not just </p><p>through the border, but also via the heavily wooded and </p><p>steep hills that surround the area.  The drugs, which also </p><p>include lesser amounts of amphetamine type stimulants (ATS), </p><p>mostly originate from the Golden Triangle.  While domestic </p><p>consumption is growing, even in Ky Son, the bulk of the </p><p>narcotics likely continue to be transshipped to other </p><p>countries, including the PRC and Australia, he added. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Dong admitted that drug smuggling is a "difficult </p><p>and complicated" problem.  To get at the problem, Dong said </p><p>that his forces have taken a number of initiatives, </p><p>including information campaigns, using informants, and, </p><p>cooperating with the local Customs office as well as the Lao </p><p>counterparts.  Despite these efforts, results appear rather </p><p>meager.  In 2002, according to Dong, his forces made only 15 </p><p>drug arrests and confiscated 37.5 kilograms of opium, 1,112 </p><p>vials of ATS, and about one kilogram of heroin. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  In addition to drugs, Dong said that other </p><p>contraband make their way down Highway 7.  Most of the </p><p>smuggled goods originate from Thailand and include small </p><p>electronics and appliances, motorbike parts, and cigarettes. </p><p>In some cases, drivers drop off goods along the road for </p><p>distribution to more remote areas. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Dong said that his equipment is "basic, but </p><p>generally sufficient."  He has drug-testing kits to make </p><p>basic tests, but for further analyses, he sends suspected </p><p>drugs to a testing lab in Hanoi.  Most of his force has </p><p>undergone Ministry of Public Security basic drug training, </p><p>which he termed "very helpful." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Dong claimed that cross border coordination is </p><p>"good" and he and his Lao counterparts have "excellent </p><p>relations."  They meet at least once a quarter, but more </p><p>often if necessary.  He said cross border information </p><p>exchanges have been "helpful" in making drug-related </p><p>arrests.  Specifically, Dong recounted that in October 2002, </p><p>he received a tip from his Lao counterpart about an opium </p><p>smuggler crossing into Vietnam via a nearby forest path. </p><p>The Lao counterpart provided information regarding timing </p><p>and routing that enabled his forces to ambush the </p><p>individual. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
