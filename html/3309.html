<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001373 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>MANILA FOR OFDA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Maoist Leader Calls September 16 General Strike, </p><p>Vows Revenge for Deaths </p><p> </p><p>REF: Kathmandu 838 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) In a press release dated July 11, Prachanda, </p><p>President of Nepal\'s Maoist Central Committee, called for </p><p>a nation-wide general strike September 16.  It would be </p><p>the first such show of force since late April (Reftel). </p><p>The release also charges "feudal elements" backed by </p><p>"foreign imperialists and expansionists," with the murders </p><p>of Maoist leaders Rit Bahadur Khadka and Krishna Sen.  In </p><p>the release Sen, an underground Maoist Central Committee </p><p>member and pamphleteer journalist whose death in detention </p><p>has been widely reported, is called "Commander."  Speaking </p><p>for the Maoist party, Prachanda pledges "to take revenge </p><p>for the murders." </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The press release was faxed to selected news </p><p>outlets in Kathmandu, and is widely considered genuine. </p><p>Post\'s unofficial translation of the release follows. </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>Murderous feudal elements, with the backing of foreign </p><p>imperialists and expansionists, have been making futile </p><p>attempts to rule the country in a barbaric, medieval </p><p>manner.  They have been killing the best sons and </p><p>daughters of the Nepali people.  The murder, terror and </p><p>looting committed by the Royal Army during the so-called </p><p>emergency have not only ridiculed the achievements of the </p><p>1990 People\'s Movement, but also all the values of human </p><p>civilization.  The murder of political activists, writers, </p><p>poets, artists, journalists and every Nepali committed to </p><p>the liberation and progress of the country has become the </p><p>feudal palace\'s everyday routine.  In this series of </p><p>cowardly murders, member of our Central Committee and </p><p>popular youth leader Comrade Rit Bahadur Khadka has been </p><p>brutally killed.  Following this, after the news came out </p><p>that Krishna Sen, a responsible member of our party and an </p><p>energetic and established poet and journalist of the </p><p>Nepali Progressive Cultural Movement, died in custody </p><p>after inhumane torture, Nepali journalists, human rights </p><p>activists and intellectuals pressured the [government]. </p><p>The government\'s intrigue- and conspiracy-laden statements </p><p>in response to the pressure have made it almost clear </p><p>[that Sen was killed].  We express solidarity with the </p><p>initiatives and movement launched by the journalists, </p><p>human rights activists and intellectuals calling for the </p><p>clarification of Commander Krishna Sen\'s whereabouts and </p><p>punishment of the criminals. </p><p> </p><p>Our party pays tribute with high honor to all martyrs, </p><p>including Commanders Rit Bahadur Khadka and Krishna Sen, </p><p>and vows to take revenge for the murders. </p><p> </p><p>Today, the Nepalese society is on the brink of either </p><p>progress or regression.  The feudal elements have closed </p><p>all doors for a peaceful political exit.  And they are </p><p>nakedly surrendering to foreigners for support for the </p><p>murder of Nepali people.  In this situation, Nepalis have </p><p>no other choice but to create a huge counter-movement for </p><p>the independence and sovereignty of the country and for </p><p>their children\'s rights to live.  No power in the world </p><p>can save the self-surrendering feudal murderers from the </p><p>people\'s united movement.  Our party has decided to appeal </p><p>for a "Nepal Bandh" [general strike] on September 16 to </p><p>protest the murders of the best of the Nepali people\'s </p><p>sons and daughters, including Commanders Rit Bahadur </p><p>Khadka and Krishna Sen, and for a positive way out of the </p><p>present crisis.  The United Front Organization and United </p><p>Revolutionary People\'s Council at the central level and </p><p>various ethnic and regional fronts will announce the </p><p>outline of the programs for this bandh.  We heartily </p><p>request all pro-people groups and the public to make the </p><p>Nepal bandh program successful in order to take the </p><p>people\'s opposition and unity against feudal murderers to </p><p>a new height. </p><p> </p><p>July 11, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>Prachanda, (President), Central Committee, N.C.P. (Maoist) </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
