HANOI 2200  B.  HANOI 2232 </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02297  01 OF 02  231018Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  PHU QUOC ISLAND DISTRICT OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DEVELOPMENT BEYOND AGRICULTURE AND FISHING, </p><p>ITS TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC MAINSTAYS.  THEY HOPE THAT ITS </p><p>TROPICAL ISLAND SETTING AND IMPROVING (THOUGH STILL WEAK) </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE WILL ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT, ATTRACT FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTMENT, AND BRING IN MORE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TOURISTS. </p><p>THE POTENTIAL FOR TOURISM IS REAL BUT WILL PROBABLY NEED </p><p>VASTLY MORE RESOURCES THAN NOW AVAILABLE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  POLOFF AND POL FSN VISITED PHU QUOC ISLAND ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 4.  (REFTELS REPORTED ON COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>DISCUSSIONS AND NARCOTICS ISSUES, RESPECTIVELY).  THE ISLAND </p><p>IS LOCATED OFF THE SOUTHWEST COAST OF VIETNAM, 40 KILOMETERS </p><p>WEST OF THE VIETNAMESE MAINLAND AND ABOUT 15 KILOMETERS </p><p>SOUTH OF CAMBODIA.  IT IS ADMINISTERED AS A DISTRICT OF KIEN </p><p>GIANG PROVINCE.  THERE ARE GOOD BEACHES AROUND MOST OF THE </p><p>ISLAND, ESPECIALLY ON THE WEST AND SOUTHEAST SIDES.  UNLIKE </p><p>THE DELTA MAINLAND, MUCH OF THE ISLAND IS HILLY AND HEAVILY </p><p>FORESTED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ACCORDING TO NGO RANG DONG, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, THE ISLAND CONSISTS OF ABOUT </p><p>600 SQUARE KILOMETERS AND HAS A POPULATION OF ABOUT 80,000, </p><p>97 PERCENT OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC KINH.  THE MAIN TOWN, DUONG </p><p>DONG, IS LOCATED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND, WITH A </p><p>POPULATION OF ABOUT 30,000.  DONG NOTED THAT AGRICULTURE "IS </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT THAN ON THE MAINLAND" DUE TO THE POOR QUALITY </p><p>OF SOIL AND THE LACK OF FLAT LAND.  FISHING HAS </p><p>TRADITIONALLY BEEN MORE IMPORTANT;  PHU QUOC IS ALSO FAMOUS </p><p>IN VIETNAM FOR ITS HIGH QUALITY FISH SAUCE AS WELL AS BLACK </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02297  01 OF 02  231018Z </p><p>PEPPERS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>GETTING THERE IS HALF THE FUN </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  THE ISLAND IS REACHED EITHER VIA FLIGHTS FROM HO </p><p>CHI MINH CITY (ONE HOUR) OR THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL OF RACH </p><p>GIA (ABOUT 25 MINUTES), OR VIA A DAILY FERRY FROM RACH GIA </p><p>(ABOUT SEVEN HOURS).  ONE FOREIGN TOURIST DESCRIBED THE </p><p>FERRY TRIP SIMPLY AS "HELLISH" BUT CHEAP AT USD FOUR. </p><p>DONG CLAIMED THAT THE PROVINCE IS NOW IMPLEMENTING A PLAN </p><p>FOR A HIGH-SPEED FERRY THAT WILL REDUCE TRAVEL TIME IN HALF, </p><p>BUT WAS UNABLE TO SAY WHEN THE NEW FERRY SERVICE MIGHT </p><p>ACTUALLY BEGIN.  ONCE ON LAND, THE ROAD SYSTEM IS QUITE </p><p>BASIC; ONLY ABOUT 27 KILOMETERS OF THE 60 KILOMETERS OF ROAD </p><p>ARE PAVED, DONG ADMITTED.  HE NONETHELESS ASSURED POLOFFS </p><p>THAT "IF YOU COME BACK IN FIVE YEARS, IT WILL LOOK </p><p>COMPLETELY DIFFERENT." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>COUNTING ON TOURISM </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  TRAN QUOC KHANH, CHIEF OF THE DISTRICT INDUSTRIAL </p><p>AND TRADE AFFAIRS OFFICE, NOTED THAT TOURISM IS GROWING </p><p>STEADILY.  WHILE HE WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE PRECISE FIGURES, </p><p>KHANH ESTIMATED THAT TOURISM IS GROWING AT "FIVE TO 10 </p><p>PERCENT" PER YEAR.  HE CITED THE ISSUANCE OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>DECREE 97 IN AUGUST 2000 AS A KEY MILESTONE, CREATING IN </p><p>DUONG DONG TOWN AND THE SURROUNDING AREA AN "OPEN ECONOMIC </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02297  01 OF 02  231018Z </p><p>ZONE."  (NOTE: KIEN GIANG PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE </p><p>OFFICIALS TOLD AMBASSADOR IN JULY 2002 THAT THE PROVINCE WAS </p><p>STILL AWAITING CENTRAL GOVERNMENT APPROVAL FOR PARTS OF THE </p><p>PROJECT, WHICH THEY NOTED WOULD EVENTUALLY ALSO INCLUDE A </p><p>RESIDENTIAL AREA, "CLEAN" COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS </p><p>INSURANCE AND BANKING, AN AIRPORT, AND A DEEP-WATER PORT. </p><p>END NOTE)  SINCE THEN, THE NUMBER OF HOTELS HAS INCREASED </p><p>FROM FOUR TO NINE (THERE ARE NOW ABOUT 200 HOTEL ROOMS ON </p><p>THE ISLAND); NUMEROUS NEW RESTAURANTS HAVE ALSO OPENED. </p><p>KHANH PREDICTED THAT WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS "AT LEAST" </p><p>FIVE MORE HOTELS WILL BE BUILT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  TOURISTS ARE NOW ABOUT EVENLY SPLIT BETWEEN FOREIGN </p><p>AND DOMESTIC, DEPENDING ON THE SEASON, ACCORDING TO KHANH. </p><p>DURING SUMMER AND FALL, THERE ARE RELATIVELY MORE VIETNAMESE </p><p>TOURISTS, MOST COMING IN ORGANIZED GROUPS OR THROUGH </p><p>SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS (WORK UNITS, WOMEN\'S ASSOCIATIONS, </p><p>ETC.).  FOREIGN TOURISTS TEND TO ARRIVE DURING THE WINTER </p><p>MONTHS.  THE ASSISTANT MANAGER OF PHU QUOC\'S SOLE THREE STAR </p><p>HOTEL SEPARATELY CLAIMED TO HAVE HAD "ABOUT 80 PERCENT </p><p>OCCUPANCY" OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS, WITH INCREASING </p><p>NUMBERS OF ORGANIZED JAPANESE GROUPS, AS WELL AS FRENCH AND </p><p>GERMAN TOURISTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)   KHANH ADMITTED THAT "IT IS NOT ENOUGH" JUST TO </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8924 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02297  02 OF 02  231018Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /009W </p><p>                  ------------------EB4DCE  231018Z /38 </p><p>P 231005Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7605 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI//FPA// </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002297 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 1431/MAC/AP/HPPHO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRING TOURISTS TO THE ISLAND -- IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02297  02 OF 02  231018Z </p><p>PROVIDE THEM WITH INTERESTING ACTIVITIES.  HE EXPRESSED A </p><p>WISH THAT DISTRICT AUTHORITIES WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE </p><p>"NATURAL BEAUTY" OF THE ISLAND AND ORGANIZE ECO TOURS AS </p><p>WELL AS TOURS AROUND THE SEA AND THE FORESTS.  KHANH NOTED </p><p>THAT THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE HAD SPECIFICALLY </p><p>DIRECTED THE DISTRICT TO ENGAGE IN TOURISM THAT PROTECTS THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>OPEN FOR BUSINESS - SORT OF </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  KHANH ALSO EXPRESSED A HOPE THAT INCREASED TOURISM </p><p>COULD FORM THE BASIS FOR MORE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT.  HE </p><p>ASKED THAT POLOFFS TAKE BACK TO THE US EMBASSY THE MESSAGE </p><p>THAT PHU QUOC IS INTERESTED IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN THE TOURISM AND INDUSTRY SECTORS.  IN THE </p><p>TOURIST SECTOR, KHANH SUGGESTED A JOINT VENTURE WORLD-CLASS </p><p>RESORT MIGHT BE FEASIBLE.  IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR, KHANH </p><p>SPECIFICALLY POINTED TOWARD SEAFOOD PROCESSING AS AN AREA </p><p>WITH "GREAT POTENTIAL."  KHANH ADMITTED THAT, AS FAR AS HE </p><p>KNOWS, THERE IS NO US FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AT THIS </p><p>TIME.  HOWEVER, PHU QUOC AUTHORITIES "WOULD VERY MUCH </p><p>WELCOME US INVESTMENT," HE DECLARED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  DESPITE KHANH\'S APPARENT INTEREST IN ATTRACTING </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT, PHU QUOC HAS NOT YET ESTABLISHED AN </p><p>INVESTMENT PROMOTION OFFICE, HE ADMITTED.  KHANH EXPRESSED A </p><p>HOPE THAT THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES WOULD ESTABLISH SUCH AN </p><p>OFFICE SOON, BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO PREDICT WHEN.  INSTEAD, </p><p>THE THREE STAR HOTEL, FOR A FEE OF USD 50, PROMISES TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02297  02 OF 02  231018Z </p><p>ORGANIZE BUSINESS MEETINGS AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ON </p><p>INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.  KHANH SAID HE WAS AWARE OF THIS </p><p>SERVICE, WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS THE HOTEL\'S INITIATIVE </p><p>AND NOT INVOLVING DISTRICT AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  PHU QUOC ARGUABLY HAS THE NATURAL BEAUTY AND </p><p>TROPICAL CLIMATE TO COMPETE FOR INTERNATIONAL TOURISTS WITH </p><p>THAILAND\'S PHUKET OR INDONESIA\'S BALI.  HOWEVER, WITHOUT </p><p>SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES DEVOTED TO </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, AND EVEN MORE FAVORABLE </p><p>INVESTMENT CONDITIONS THAN NOW EXIST, PHU QUOC\'S TOURISM </p><p>BOOM IS APT TO REMAIN LIMITED, AND ITS ECONOMIC PROSPECTS </p><p>MODEST. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
