<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000705 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, GT, OAS, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: AGREEMENT ON CLANDESTINE GROUP COMMISSION </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 471 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The human rights community, Human Rights </p><p>Ombudsman, and FM Gutierrez agreed on the make-up and mandate </p><p>for an international commission to investigate recent attacks </p><p>on human rights defenders in Guatemala.  Helen Mack invited </p><p>the Ambassador to attend the public signing ceremony on March </p><p>13 and expressed appreciation for strong USG support for the </p><p>proposal.  That support will be tested as the commission </p><p>moves toward formation in September.  We believe the proposal </p><p>is worthy and was strengthened by the facilitation of Human </p><p>Rights Watch facilitator Jose Miguel Vivanco.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The accord on formation of a Commission to </p><p>Investigate Illegal and Clandestine Security Groups (CICIACS) </p><p>is for three commissioners, with subpoena powers, a witness </p><p>protection program, a one-year term (renewable, in six month </p><p>increments, for up to 12 months more), focused on the </p><p>1994-2003 period, to begin its operations in September 2003. </p><p>The GOG pledged $256,000 in initial financial support and </p><p>committed to solicit funding from the international </p><p>community, to be managed by UNOPS.  A copy of the full text </p><p>of the agreement (5 pages) was forwarded to WHA/CEN on March </p><p>14. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The agreement includes a broad mandate to investigate </p><p>illegal and clandestine groups, with special emphasis on </p><p>those responsible for attacks on human rights defenders, </p><p>justice workers, witnesses, journalists, union members and </p><p>others.  It is also charged with investigating illegal or </p><p>clandestine activities of state security forces and private </p><p>security forces since the signing of the Peace Accord on </p><p>Human Rights on March 29, 1994 (relevant antecedents may also </p><p>be investigated).  The goal of this investigation is to </p><p>dismantle criminal groups with links to the state and </p><p>prosecute responsible individuals, and end attacks and </p><p>threats on groups listed above.  A final report on the </p><p>structure, organization, and financing of groups or networks </p><p>responsible for attacks and threats will include </p><p>recommendations to the government.  An annex to the report </p><p>will include information necessary to initiate administrative </p><p>action against state agents and another for criminal </p><p>prosecution. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) During a March 10-13 visit to Guatemala, Jose Miguel </p><p>Vivanco of Human Rights Watch reassured skeptical NGO\'s and </p><p>rallied GOG and international support, culminating in the </p><p>March 13 agreement.  Ombudsman Sergio Morales announced on </p><p>March 14 that his office had compiled 77 complaints of </p><p>attacks, threats, crimes and intimidation of justice system </p><p>workers, witnesses, and citizens which will be submitted to </p><p>the commission in September. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) With Department concurrence, the Ambassador has </p><p>been actively supportive of the CICIACS proposal, which has </p><p>now cleared its first major hurdle.  NGOs are elated by </p><p>Vivanco\'s success.  However, many other obstacles remain to a </p><p>fully functioning commission.  The Executive must now draft a </p><p>decree, negotiate agreements with the UN and OAS, submit </p><p>those agreements to Congress for ratification, select a </p><p>notable Guatemalan member of the commission.  We will monitor </p><p>and report these steps closely. </p><p>6.  (SBU) We may not receive an official request for </p><p>financial support immediately, but would like to be in a </p><p>position to indicate the approximate amount that we are </p><p>likely to commit in order to aid planning and to encourage </p><p>other donors.  Can we informally and unofficially advise that </p><p>we are likely to commit $500,000? </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) We can also anticipate requests, once the </p><p>Commission is established, for information, including </p><p>declassified documents.  The Ambassador has worked to lower </p><p>expectations of a special declassification project but urges </p><p>the Department to consider standing up now an effort to </p><p>compile an all-source report that we could provide the </p><p>Commission at the onset of its work in September.  There may </p><p>be better ways to be responsive but, knowing that the </p><p>requests will come, we should prepare now to be as responsive </p><p>as possible. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
