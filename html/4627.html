(U) Summary:  This week in Nepal, armed assailants </p><p>attacked a Joint Secretary at a public event in Kathmandu; </p><p>the army blamed political appointees for poor intelligence </p><p>capabilities; Maoists destroyed three Village Development </p><p>Committee buildings in Gulmi district, leaving only seven </p><p>intact; and a development arm of the government announced </p><p>that it would not fund projects in a Maoist-affected area </p><p>due to security concerns.  India stepped up the pressure on </p><p>Maoists, and pledged to cooperate with Nepali border guards </p><p>against terrorism and transnational crime.  NGO workers </p><p>escaped injury in a Maoist attack in southern Siraha </p><p>district.  Villagers who have abandoned their homes are </p><p>ignoring Maoist appeals to return.  The GON released </p><p>information about recovery efforts in Jumla, estimates of </p><p>airport damage and Maoist casualty figures. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>ARMED ASSAILANTS ATTACK JOINT SECRETARY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Two assailants threatened Joint Secretary for </p><p>Education Yuba Raj Pandey in broad daylight after storming </p><p>an afternoon discussion of the Maoist-organized educational </p><p>strike (ref A).  The assailants pointed a pistol at the </p><p>Joint Secretary and smeared his face with black paint, then </p><p>waved the gun at other participants, including teachers\' </p><p>organizations, student organizations and journalists, before </p><p>fleeing the scene, chanting Maoist slogans. </p><p> </p><p>STRONGER RNA TURNS ATTENTION TO INTELLIGENCE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Royal Nepal Army (RNA) officials claim, with some </p><p>exaggeration, that more competent technicians and better- </p><p>trained flight crews together with recently acquired </p><p>helicopters, arms and communication equipment are making </p><p>their forces "stronger by the day."  However, in addition to </p><p>"excellent" local-level intelligence networks, the army says </p><p>it must develop an active central intelligence agency in </p><p>order to operate efficiently against the Maoists.  The RNA </p><p>put the blame for current poor intelligence on an excessive </p><p>number of political appointees in the ranks of the National </p><p>Investigation Department, Nepal\'s national intelligence </p><p>service, under the Home Ministry. </p><p> </p><p>ONLY SEVEN VDCs REMAIN IN DEVASTATED GULMI DISTRICT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) With the recent destruction of three more Village </p><p>Development Committee (VDC) buildings in Gulmi, only seven </p><p>of the central district\'s 79 VDCs remain intact.  Maoist </p><p>destruction of the other 72 VDCs has prompted government </p><p>employees, including health workers, to move to the district </p><p>headquarters, and reportedly has driven an increasing number </p><p>of boys and girls from their village homes to avoid being </p><p>used as human shields by the insurgents.  Although some </p><p>health workers have been providing services in the field, </p><p>transportation of medicine and equipment is difficult, and </p><p>most villagers have no access to health care of any kind. </p><p> </p><p>NO DEVELOPMENT IN RUKUM </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The government\'s Remote Area Development Committee </p><p>(RADC) has halted all development projects in Rukum (in west </p><p>central Nepal) due to security concerns. Even those that are </p><p>nearing completion after four years of work and millions of </p><p>rupees of investment are being abandoned.  According to the </p><p>RADC, since 2.8 million rupees allocated for Rukum last year </p><p>could not be spent due to adverse security conditions, the </p><p>committee has elected not to allocate more funding for the </p><p>district.  The RADC is also discouraging foreign investors </p><p>from funding development projects there. </p><p> </p><p>INDIA TURNS UP THE HEAT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Nepalese and Indian border officials meeting in </p><p>Baharaich, India this week reportedly agreed to cooperate in </p><p>controlling terrorism and other transnational crimes such as </p><p>trafficking in persons and smuggling.  Officials also </p><p>pledged to cooperate in cross-border exchange of prisoners. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Pressure by the GOI reportedly has forced an </p><p>estimated 200 members of the All India Nepal Unity Society </p><p>(AINUS) to leave Indian and move to Nepal\'s central Rolpa </p><p>district.  After the GOI banned AINUS for supporting the </p><p>Maoists and handed over to the GON three of the </p><p>organization\'s leaders, members of the group fled to Nepal </p><p>to avoid arrest.  According to press reports, the AINUS </p><p>members are being trained by the Maoists in military skills. </p><p> </p><p>NGO WORKERS UNINJURED IN SIRAHA ATTACK </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Approximately 10-15 Nepali workers from Save the </p><p>Children/US, CARE and Nepal Family Health Program (NFHP) </p><p>were in Lahan, southern Siraha district for a conference </p><p>during Wednesday night\'s attack by Maoist insurgents (ref </p><p>B).  The NGO workers remained inside their hotel when they </p><p>heard gunfire outside.  NFHP reported to USAID that security </p><p>forces entered the hotel at about midnight, rounded up all </p><p>the guests and took them to another location "for their own </p><p>protection."  None of the workers was harmed in the </p><p>incident, and all were later released. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Maoists destroyed police offices, forestry offices, </p><p>three banks and the offices of the Regional Road Department </p><p>in the attack, which came just two days after the insurgents </p><p>announced plans to stop attacks on infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p>VILLAGERS LEAVING SALYAN DISTRICT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Increasing numbers of villagers are leaving Salyan </p><p>District, declared by the Home Ministry to be "the third </p><p>most fragile" after Rolpa and Rukum, according to press </p><p>reports from the district.  Hundreds of local residents </p><p>reportedly visit the district headquarters every day, to </p><p>obtain an official letter allowing them to travel out of the </p><p>midwestern district. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Fleeing villagers have stated that they are living </p><p>in constant fear of the insurgents, and that tight </p><p>restrictions by government forces on food have made the </p><p>situation in the district worse.  Maoists reportedly </p><p>purchased all the dry food in the district\'s four major </p><p>markets on one day three months ago, sparking controls by </p><p>security personnel on the importation of food into the </p><p>district. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Meanwhile, villagers taking shelter in Musikot, </p><p>headquarters of midwestern Rukum district, report that </p><p>Maoists have urged them publicly to return to their homes in </p><p>the countryside.  None of the displaced villagers has </p><p>returned, despite the insurgents\' appeal--and despite a </p><p>reported warning to one of the villagers that he would be </p><p>killed in the crossfire when the Maoists attack the district </p><p>capital--due to belief that the call to return is a ploy to </p><p>"trap" the local residents back into Maoist control. </p><p> </p><p>GON ESTIMATES AIRPORT DAMAGE AT 270 MILLION NRS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) According to a December 4 press release by the </p><p>Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, the </p><p>reconstruction of 14 airports damaged by Maoist attacks will </p><p>cost the GON 270 million Nrs (3.5 million USD).  Nine of the </p><p>fourteen airports are functioning at a reduced capacity </p><p>following preliminary repairs.  All fourteen airports were </p><p>damaged in the last year. </p><p> </p><p>RECOVERY SLOW AFTER MAOIST ATTACKS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) reported </p><p>on November 30 that the local school, hospital and </p><p>government offices in Khalanga, the capital of western Jumla </p><p>district, are still closed two weeks after a major Maoist </p><p>attack (ref C).  According to the NHRC, Maoists looted </p><p>approximately 1.5 million Nrs (190,000 USD) worth of </p><p>medicine from the hospital, which is now is running out of </p><p>supplies.  The NHRC also reported that local residents </p><p>cannot afford to buy food, since the banks have been shut </p><p>down.  Government workers have been unable to acquire their </p><p>allotted ration of rice, since no Chief District Officer or </p><p>Local Development Officer is present to write the ration </p><p>slips.  Forty government officers were killed in the </p><p>November 14 attack. </p><p> </p><p>MOD RELEASES CASUALTY FIGURES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The Ministry of Defence reported that fourteen </p><p>Maoists were killed in retaliatory attacks by security </p><p>forces on December 1, 2 and 3.  According to the Ministry, </p><p>the Maoists were suspected of having set booby traps for the </p><p>security forces in seven districts around the country. </p><p>Sixteen more Maoists were killed in retaliatory attacks on </p><p>Thursday, December 5. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
