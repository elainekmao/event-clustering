<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000921 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/EX, EB/ESC/ESP </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC, OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, AFIN, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: NATIVES RESTLESS OVER SCOPE OF NEW SANCTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. The Charge d\'Affaires, a.i. and Econoff held briefings on </p><p>the new U.S. sanctions on July 30th for U.S. citizens, and </p><p>July 31st for Burmese and third-country businesspeople, NGOs, </p><p>and the diplomatic and UN community.  Both briefings were </p><p>well-received.  We asked the attendees not to debate U.S. </p><p>policy, but to stay focused on technical issues.  Generally </p><p>the two audiences complied, but were genuinely shocked, and </p><p>in some cases irked, by the ramifications of the sanctions -- </p><p>particularly the ban on financial services.  We tried to give </p><p>general advice and explanations about the sanctions, but </p><p>advised all to contact an attorney or OFAC directly to </p><p>discuss specific cases. </p><p> </p><p>3. The U.S. citizens, including representatives of U.S. </p><p>companies and U.S.-based NGOs, were concerned that they would </p><p>not be able to import their personal effects when they </p><p>returned to the United States.  Many have lived in Burma for </p><p>years, and have accumulated Burmese-made products of </p><p>significant value.  Several asked whether there might be some </p><p>kind of waiver for U.S. citizens to carry home personal </p><p>effects, or for those who could prove they had purchased </p><p>Burmese products before the import ban went into effect. </p><p>U.S. citizens conducting business in Burma were quite worried </p><p>that they would no longer be able to get U.S. dollars </p><p>transferred to Burma from the United States or a </p><p>third-country.  The businesspeople agreed that the impact of </p><p>the sanctions would depend in part if the GOB can adapt its </p><p>trade policy to accept letters of credit in currencies other </p><p>than the U.S. dollars. </p><p> </p><p>4. The second briefing filled the American Center auditorium </p><p>beyond capacity and was somewhat more heated than the first. </p><p>Representatives of foreign embassies in Rangoon were upset </p><p>that remittances of dollars into Burma to fund Embassy </p><p>payrolls and operations were not covered by the first general </p><p>license.  Several Ambassadors urged us to pressure Treasury </p><p>to issue such a license for them as soon as possible.  The UN </p><p>representatives were pleased to be included in the initial </p><p>general license, but confused as to how they would be able to </p><p>bring in funds without relying on frozen correspondent </p><p>accounts in the United States.  Many businesspeople and NGO </p><p>representatives asked about the status of payments that fall </p><p>afoul of the remittance ban and asset freeze, whether these </p><p>payments would also be frozen, or merely returned to sender. </p><p> </p><p>5. Action requested:  We would appreciate specific guidance </p><p>on the legality of transactions (both for those with general </p><p>licenses and those without licenses) in U.S. dollars from a </p><p>third-country bank outside the United States, directly to a </p><p>state-owned bank in Burma.  Also, please advise whether U.S. </p><p>dollar letters of credit, even if between a third-country </p><p>bank and a Burmese bank, will become problematic under the </p><p>new law. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
