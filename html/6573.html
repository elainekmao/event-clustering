<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SINGAPORE 001099 </p><p> </p><p>CINCPAC FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL;MASS, MOPS, SN </p><p>SUBJECT: "TELL THEM TO BE MORE CAREFUL:" IRAQ ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>RUFFLES SINGAPORE\'S FEATHERS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMB. FRANK LAVIN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) MFA PERMSEC (2) BILAHARI KAUSIKAN, PLAINLY IRRITATED, </p><p>CALLED DCM AT OOB ON MARCH 20 TO EXPRESS THE MFA\'S CONCERN AT </p><p>MISCHARACTERIZATION OF SINGAPORE\'S POSITION DURING THE STATE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S MARCH 19 PRESS BRIEFING.  SINGAPORE DID NOT </p><p>APPRECIATE, HE SAID, PRESS REPORTS IMPLYING THAT IT HAD </p><p>CHANGED ITS STANCE ON MEMBERSHIP IN THE IRAQ COALITION. </p><p>THESE RESULTED FROM THE SPOKESMAN\'S STATEMENT THAT "THERE IS </p><p>SINGAPORE, THERE IS PORTUGAL, ALL OF WHOM SAID IN THE LAST 24 </p><p>HOURS IT IS OKAY TO NAME THEM," RESULTING IN AN AFP REPORT </p><p>THAT THE THREE NEWLY LISTED COUNTRIES HAD "PREFERRED TO KEEP </p><p>THEIR SUPPORT ANONYMOUS." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THAT WASN\'T THE CASE, KAUSIKAN REMONSTRATED. </p><p>SINGAPORE HAD ALWAYS MADE CLEAR ITS SUPPORT FOR THE EFFORT TO </p><p>DISARM SADDAM, AND HAD NEVER SAID TO THE U.S. THAT IT DID NOT </p><p>WANT TO BE MENTIONED.  (APPARENTLY, SINGAPORE HAD BEEN </p><p>CONCERNED NOT TO BE LISTED UNDER THE TITLE "COALITION OF THE </p><p>WILLING," BUT WAS HAPPY WITH THE NOMENCLATURE THAT WAS </p><p>FINALLY ADOPED.)  THE SNAFU WAS EMBARRASSING TO A GOVERNMENT </p><p>WHICH HAD GONE OUT OF ITS WAY TO BE STEADFAST IN ITS POLICY </p><p>ON IRAQ; HE BELIEVED IT RESULTED FROM LACK OF COORDINATION </p><p>WITHIN THE USG.  HE INSISTED THAT HIS DEMARCHE BE REPORTED TO </p><p>WASHINGTON.  (DCM OF COURSE AGREED TO DO SO, BUT HAS EDITED </p><p>OUT THE INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AFTER CONSULTING THE BRIEFING TRANSCRIPT, THE DCM </p><p>NOTED THAT A LARGE PART OF THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO LIE WITH </p><p>AFP\'S EMBROIDERY OF THE SPOKESMAN\'S WORDS.  HE ASSURED THE </p><p>PERMSEC THAT ANY MISREPRESENTATION OF SINGAPORE\'S POSITION </p><p>WAS TOTALLY INADVERTENT.  KAUSIKAN, MOLLIFIED, EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT HE WAS NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING NEW OR DIFFERENT TO BE </p><p>ENUNCIATED BY THE USG ON THIS ISSUE AT THIS TIME.  "JUST TELL </p><p>THEM TO BE MORE CAREFUL." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  WE SUSPECT THAT THE MFA RECEIVED SOME HEAT </p><p>FROM THE GOS\' SENIOR LEADERSHIP OVER THE PRESS COVERAGE, AND </p><p>KAUSIKAN WAS FEELING THAT HEAT.  THE QUESTION OF WHETHER </p><p>SINGAPORE HAS BEEN "FORTHRIGHT" IN ITS SUPPORT FOR WAR IN </p><p>IRAQ IS A POLITICALLY-CHARGED ONE DOMESTICALLY, AS GOS </p><p>CRITICS HAVE LAMBASTED IT FOR "HIDING" ITS SUBSERVIENCE TO </p><p>THE U.S. BEHIND A WALL OF OBFUSCATION UNTIL LAST FRIDAY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LAVIN </p><p></p></div>
