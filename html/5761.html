<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000772 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/RA, NEA/ARP, EB/CBA FOR MICHAEL GARCIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 02/17/08 </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, BBSR, ECON, ETRD, EINV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMEMBASSY ABU DHABI AND AMCONSUL DUBAI FACILITATE U.S. </p><p>BUSINESS IN THE UAE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 29441 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Comment and summary.  The U.S. Mission to the UAE has </p><p>facilitated a number of high-profile business deals in the </p><p>UAE during the last year.  Family connections and political </p><p>influence remain key to doing business in the UAE and many of </p><p>our official contacts also own prominent private businesses, </p><p>act as sponsors to foreign firms, or influence the selection </p><p>of bids for major government/local contracts. Our close and </p><p>continuing relationships with the powerful elite in the UAE </p><p>has no doubt led to increased U.S. exports, selection of U.S. </p><p>firms for various contracts and tenders, and positive resolution </p><p>for U.S. firms in commercial disputes during the last year. </p><p>End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Sealing The Deal: Engine Alliance and Emirates Air </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Following a two-year campaign, Engine Alliance </p><p>(a General Electric/Pratt & Whitney joint venture) signed </p><p>a General Terms Agreement on June 5, 2002 with Emirates </p><p>Airline to provide the engines to power Emirates new fleet of </p><p>A-380 aircraft.  The Ambassador and Consul General in Dubai, </p><p>supported by FCS Dubai, actively advocated on behalf of Engine </p><p>Alliance and made official representations on the American firm\'s </p><p>behalf throughout the 2-year long campaign, including with </p><p>Dubai Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Rashid, Emirates CEO Shaykh Ahmed </p><p>Bin Saeed, and senior executives of Emirates Airline.  The </p><p>expected total value of the program -- with parts and services </p><p>over the life of the program -- is estimated at over US$3.6 </p><p>billion. Additionally, with Emirates seriously considering buying </p><p>between 10-20 additional A-380s, this deal will squarely put </p><p>the Engine Alliance in a strong position to capture such follow-on </p><p>orders. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Ambassador and Consul General have also lobbied </p><p>extensively with Emirates CEO Shaykh Ahmed on behalf of </p><p>Boeing\'s efforts to sell 25 B-777 long-range aircraft </p><p>to Emirates Air.  This sale is still pending. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Managing The Boycott Clause: Raytheon and Civil Aviation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador, FCS and Econchief\'s sustained </p><p>advocacy brought to a close on June 14, 2002 a 39-month long </p><p>saga to help U.S. firm Raytheon secure a US$30 million </p><p>deal with the Abu Dhabi Civil Aviation Department for </p><p>air traffic control radars in Abu Dhabi and Al-Ain.  The </p><p>Ambassador successfully urged Abu Dhabi Crown Prince (and </p><p>de facto ruler) Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayid Al-Nahyan to over-rule </p><p>his own Planning Department in May by having the Abu Dhabi </p><p>Executive Council -- in writing -- exempt Raytheon from the </p><p>Israeli boycott clause of the contract. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) When the French company Airsys proved unable to beat </p><p>Raytheon\'s price and the Abu Dhabi Executive Council awarded the </p><p>contract to the U.S. firm in August 2001, Airsys tried to make </p><p>an issue of the Israeli boycott clause in the antiquated, </p><p>standard contract form still used by the Deaprtment of Civil </p><p>Aviation. Using their connections within Abu Dhabi\'s Planning </p><p>Committee, the French sought to have the Raytheon bid </p><p>disqualified for non-compliance unless the firm accepted the </p><p>boycott provision.  Advocacy by the Ambassador and the country team </p><p>throughout this 3-year period was instrumental in helping Raytheon </p><p>overcome efforts by Airsys to wrest away the deal. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Moving Full Speed Ahead: Ford Agency Dispute </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In the fall of 2001, Consul General Dubai made repeated </p><p>interventions with Dubai Crown Prince Shaykh Mohammed Bin </p><p>Rashid to resolve a longstanding dispute between Ford Motor </p><p>Company and its dysfunctional local agent, Galadari Brothers. </p><p>Shaykh Mohammed directed the Dubai Attorney General to broker an </p><p>out-of-court settlement that allowed Ford to establish a new </p><p>agency with Al-Tayer Motors.  After being absent from the local </p><p>market for a number of years, Ford is now once again selling cars </p><p>in the UAE, and the UAE has developed into one of its most </p><p>successful regional markets -- helping to offset downturns in </p><p>the Saudi market, according to the regional Ford office based </p><p>in Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Protecting U.S. Pharmaceuticals: PhRMA v. UAEG </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Ambassador and Econchief negotiated tirelessly </p><p>throughout spring 2002 to stop the production of pirated U.S. </p><p>pharmaceuticals in the UAE and establish adequate IPR protection </p><p>for American products over the long-term.  Despite UAE </p><p>pharmaceutical manufacturer Julphar\'s political ties at the highest </p><p>levels of the UAEG, the Front Office intervened on behalf of </p><p>the U.S. pharmaceutical industry several times at the </p><p>political (ministerial) level and doggedly pursued concessions </p><p>from both industry representative PhRMA and the UAEG in </p><p>face-to-face negotiations.  On March 27, 2002, </p><p>the UAE Ministries of Health and Finance and Industry </p><p>conveyed in writing their acceptance of PhRMA\'s "best and final </p><p>offer" under which 25 U.S. patent-protected, innovative products </p><p>would be afforded 5-year data exclusivity protection (as against </p><p>a UAE-submitted list of 168). Under the terms of the agreement we </p><p>crafted and which PhRMA and the UAEG accepted, all other </p><p>U.S.-patented drugs, whether pending registration or not, will </p><p>be given data exclusivity protection in the UAE market </p><p>equal to the patent term -- a major commitment which puts the </p><p>UAE well beyond its minimal WTO TRIPs obligations. </p><p>9.  (C) To date, the UAEG has kept to the terms of the March </p><p>agreement and has not registered any new U.S. pharmaceuticals for </p><p>production in the UAE, despite such requests from Julphar and </p><p>other local manufacturers.  As a result of Post\'s </p><p>continuing efforts, the UAE has been removed from the 301 </p><p>Watchlist -- a major priority for the UAEG -- and passed fully </p><p>TRIPs-compliant patent, copyright, and trademark laws in 2002, </p><p>further protecting an incalculable amount/dollar value of </p><p>U.S. intellectual property in the UAE for years to come. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Sustained Advocacy For U.S. Oil Companies </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Post has a long tradition of advocating on behalf of </p><p>U.S. oil companies for government contracts and tenders in the </p><p>UAE.  As a result, U.S. firms are well represented in the oil </p><p>sector here (Exxonmobil is an equity stakeholder in Abu </p><p>Dhabi\'s onshore concession and Conoco-Phillips manages Dubai\'s </p><p>main oilfield).  Our advocacy efforts paid off in May 2002, when </p><p>(in a surprise to many in the industry) </p><p>U.S. energy firm Occidental Petroleum was selected to take a 24.5 </p><p>percent stake in the US$3.5 billion Dolphin Project to pipe </p><p>natural gas from Qatar to the UAE.  Aware of Post\'s sustained </p><p>efforts to advocate on behalf of American firms, de facto Defense </p><p>Minister Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan and patron of the Dolphin </p><p>Project told the Ambassador in advance of the official </p><p>announcement on May 8 that a U.S. firm had won the competition. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Most recently, ADNOC Deputy CEO Abdullah Bin Nasser </p><p>Al-Suweidi asked Econchief and Econoff to suggest companies to </p><p>participate in a joint venture with contracting Al-Fahim Group for </p><p>oilfield services in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. </p><p>Econoff passed ADNOC the name of U.S. company Halliburton\'s </p><p>regional representative and in January 2003, Halliburton signed </p><p>a Joint Venture Agreement with Al-Fahim to offer open and cased </p><p>hole logging and wireline perforating services in Abu Dhabi. </p><p>While the value of the business is relatively small, it is </p><p>indicative of the informal way in which the Front Offices </p><p>frequently facilitate and promote business for U.S. companies. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) We eagerly await ADNOC\'s decision later this year to </p><p>select an international oil company as a 28 percent equity </p><p>partner in the development of the Upper Zakum oil </p><p>field -- one of the largest offshore oil fields in the world. </p><p>This project is both technologically complex and commercially </p><p>lucrative (the field holds an approximate 40-50 billion barrels </p><p>of oil; half of Abu Dhabi\'s reserves). In mid-2002, ADNOC </p><p>Deputy CEO Abdullah Bin Nasser Al-Suweidi asked Econchief to </p><p>facilitate contacts at an appropriately senior level with U.S. </p><p>oil giant Chevron-Texaco; ADNOC had not had previous contact </p><p>with the firm and wanted to ensure their initial approach was </p><p>appropriately received.  Econchief was able to contact Chevron\'s </p><p>Vice-President, brief him on Upper Zakum and Mr. Al-Suweidi, </p><p>and put the two together by telephone the next day.  As a result, </p><p>Chevron-Texaco has been invited to submit a bid in the </p><p>project, raising U.S. participation to two (the other is </p><p>ExxonMobil), out of a total field of five.  While the final </p><p>decision has not yet been made, ADNOC CEO Yousef Bin </p><p>Omeir recently told Charge that American oil firms bring </p><p>the best technology and expertise to the table. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
