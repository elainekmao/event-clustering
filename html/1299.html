(C) SUMMARY: A WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMER WAS ATTACKED </p><p>WITH A MACHETE BY A WAR VETERAN ON SEPTEMBER 26 AFTER </p><p>THE VETERAN TRIED TO STOP HIM FROM PLANTING TOBACCO. </p><p>THE FARMER SUFFERED A DEEP GASH ACROSS HIS FACE AND </p><p>NOSE, AND WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL, WHERE HE IS </p><p>RECOVERING FOLLOWING SURGERY.  THIS INCIDENT IS </p><p>INDICATIVE OF RISING TENSIONS ON COMMERCIAL FARMS, WHERE </p><p>CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN OCCUPYING WAR VETERANS AND FARM </p><p>WORKERS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE.  POLICE REACTION HAS </p><p>BEEN LESS THAN PROFESSIONAL IN MANY CASES, ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>FORCE NOW HAS ORDERS TO PREVENT FURTHER OCCUPATIONS. </p><p>THE COMING RAINY SEASON WILL BRING A NEW DIMENSION TO </p><p>FARM TENSION -- BETWEEN WAR VETERANS AND THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>WHICH TO DATE HAS FAILED TO DELIVER ON ITS PROMISE OF </p><p>LAND TO THIS ROUGH CONSTITUENCY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>THE ATTACK </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ACCORDING TO RICHARD AMYOT OF THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS UNION (CFU), A WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMER WAS </p><p>BRUTALLY ATTACKED BY A WAR VETERAN WITH A MACHETE ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 26.  THE ATTACK OCCURRED IN KAROI, A FARMING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05515  01 OF 02  281517Z </p><p>DISTRICT 200 KM NORTH OF HARARE, A REGION TORN BY LAND- </p><p>RELATED VIOLENCE SINCE EARLY THIS YEAR.  AMYOT TOLD </p><p>ECONOFF THAT THE FARMER, MARSHALL ROPER, HAD BEGUN TO </p><p>PLANT TOBACCO ON HIS FARM, WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY </p><p>SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.  TWELVE </p><p>SQUATTERS APPROACHED ROPER AND TOLD HIM HE COULD NOT </p><p>PLANT.  A HEATED DISCUSSION ENSUED, AND A WAR VETERAN </p><p>WITH A MACHETE SWUNG AND STRUCK ROPER IN THE FACE, </p><p>CAUSING A DEEP GASH ACROSS HIS CHEEKS AND NOSE.  ROPER </p><p>FIRED A PISTOL INTO THE AIR IN SELF-DEFENSE AFTER </p><p>COLLAPSING ON THE GROUND.  THE WAR VETERANS THEN FLED. </p><p>AMYOT BELIEVES ROPER WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IF HE HAD </p><p>NOT BEEN ARMED.  THE POLICE HAVE ARRESTED FOUR PEOPLE </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT, BUT THEY ARE REPORTEDLY STILL </p><p>LOOKING FOR ROPER\'S ATTACKER.  A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE </p><p>SEVERELY WOUNDED ROPER APPEARED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 27 EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS", </p><p>SPARKING WIDESPREAD DISGUST AND INDIGNATION IN HARARE. </p><p>MINISTER OF JUSTICE JONATHAN MOYO AND ZANU-PF SPOKESMAN </p><p>NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA BOTH EXPRESSED REGRET AT THE INCIDENT </p><p>AND PROMISED A FULL INVESTIGATION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AMYOT STATED THAT THE ATTACK ON ROPER WAS NOT AN </p><p>ISOLATED INCIDENT.  ROPER AND MANY OTHER FARMERS IN </p><p>OTHER REGIONS HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS THREATS OVER THE </p><p>LAST WEEKS.  THE PREVIOUS WEEK, A GROUP OF COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS, FED UP WITH THE FARM INVASIONS, LACK OF POLICE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05515  01 OF 02  281517Z </p><p>INTERVENTION, AND A NEED TO BEGIN PLANTING, BLOCKED A </p><p>ROAD IN THE CHIVHU FARM DISTRICT IN CENTRAL ZIMBABWE </p><p>WITH A BARRIER TO KEEP WAR VETERANS AND OTHER FARM </p><p>INVADERS FROM INTERRUPTING THEIR PLANTING OPERATIONS. </p><p>THIS LED TO A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE FARMERS AND </p><p>THEIR WORKERS ON ONE SIDE, AND, ON THE OTHER, WAR </p><p>VETERANS, INCLUDING, ACCORDING TO AMYOT, PLAINCLOTHES </p><p>POLICEMEN AND/OR AGENTS FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATION (CIO).  THE WAR VETERANS SHOT AT THE </p><p>FARMERS WITH MILITARY-STYLE ASSAULT WEAPONS AND THE </p><p>FARMERS FIRED BACK, BUT NO ONE WAS HURT.  POLICE </p><p>ARRESTED FOUR OF THE FARMERS AND SEVERAL FARM WORKERS </p><p>AND TOOK THEM TO THE LOCAL STATION.  A GROUP OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND THEIR FARM WORKERS, NUMBERING IN </p><p>THE THOUSANDS, CONVERGED ON THE STATION TO SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>DEMAND THE RELEASE OF THEIR COLLEAGUES AND TO PROTEST </p><p>THE GENERAL BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND ORDER IN THE AREA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>CONFUSION REIGNS REGARDING THE ROLE OF THE ZRP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AMYOT SAID THAT POLICE REACTIONS TO INCIDENTS ON </p><p>THE FARMS HAVE VARIED FROM REGION TO REGION.

POLICE </p><p>COMMANDERS IN SOME AREAS ARE ABIDING BY THIS ORDER </p><p>WHILE, IN OTHER REGIONS, THEY DO NOTHING TO STOP ILLEGAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES BY SQUATTERS OR, IN SOME CASES, EVEN ACTIVELY </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THEM. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: VIOLENT CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN FARMERS </p><p>AND WAR VETERANS MAY ESCALATE IN THE COMING WEEKS, AS </p><p>FARMERS TRY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH PLANTING BEFORE THE </p><p>ONSET OF RAINS IN NOVEMBER, AND WAR VETERANS TRY TO </p><p>BLOCK THEM.  INFORMATION MINISTER MOYO AND ZANU-PF HAD </p><p>LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO CONDEMN THE ATTACK ON ROPER.  THEY </p><p>REITERATED THAT NO NEW FARM OCCUPATIONS OR INTERFERENCE </p><p>WITH FARMING ACTIVITIES WOULD BE PERMITTED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THEY ALSO CONTINUED TO SUPPORT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE </p><p>OCCUPATIONS AS ON-GOING POLITICAL "DEMONSTRATIONS".  THE </p><p>GOZ HAS BEEN MAKING THESE PLEDGES FOR SOME TIME, BUT NEW </p><p>OCCUPATIONS AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES CONTINUE, RAISING </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE GOZ IS LOSING CONTROL OVER </p><p>THE WAR VETERANS.  THIS RELATIONSHIP BEARS CLOSE </p><p>MONITORING AS WELL, AS THE RAINS DRAW NEARER, AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT FINDS ITSELF WITH INCREASINGLY LESS ROOM TO </p><p>MANEUVER.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05515  02 OF 02  281517Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
