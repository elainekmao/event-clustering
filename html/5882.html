<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000386 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:1.6.X6 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: VP ON CURRENT POLITICS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ABUJA 0015 </p><p>      ABUJA 0016 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Nigeria\'s Vice President claims his earlier </p><p>flirtation with running for President was a ruse to distract </p><p>IBB.  According to Atiku, the ambitious former military ruler </p><p>is now effectively sidelined for 2003.  Buhari\'s base in the </p><p>North is narrower than most observers believe, Atiku says, </p><p>asserting that he and President Obasanjo will win handily. </p><p>Clearly pleased with his pivotal role in securing Obasanjo\'s </p><p>renomination, Atiku looks forward to 2007.  Obasanjo still </p><p>faces a credibility gap.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Vice President Atiku Abubakar February 7 invited DCM </p><p>for communal lunch after Juma\'at prayers and then for a brief </p><p>private meeting afterward.  Atiku was in excellent spirits and </p><p>remarked that his health had improved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Agreeing that his own actions had been critical to the </p><p>success of the Obasanjo/Atiku ticket at the early January PDP </p><p>convention (refs), Atiku reviewed events from his perspective. </p><p>He had gone to sleep on Friday night, January 3, when Obasanjo </p><p>returned from an unsuccessful visit to the Bauchi delegation </p><p>and awakened his number two.  The angry delegates had "sent </p><p>the President packing," and Obasanjo needed Atiku\'s support to </p><p>salvage the ticket.  Violating security regulations in the </p><p>interest of showing unity, they drove from rebel delegation to </p><p>rebel delegation together in one car. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) "I had to pity the man," Atiku said.  Over and over, </p><p>delegates said they would vote for Obasanjo because Atiku </p><p>requested them to and despite their anger over Obasanjo\'s </p><p>failure to keep his promises.  The Governors also had to be </p><p>"brought along," Atiku continued.  They wanted firm assurances </p><p>(from Atiku) that Obasanjo would "behave differently next time </p><p>[in the 2003-2007 term]" than he had heretofore. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Atiku felt IBB was significantly diminished in the </p><p>wake of the PDP convention (reftels).  "At the last minute," </p><p>IBB had called Governor Kure to tell him the Niger delegation </p><p>should not vote for Obasanjo and Atiku.  Kure declined to </p><p>follow his patron\'s guidance, saying Niger had committed </p><p>itself and would not renege.  IBB\'s initiatives during this </p><p>electoral cycle were focused on sowing confusion and holding </p><p>Atiku down, so that the road would be clear for an IBB win in </p><p>2007, Atiku opined; the former military ruler fears Atiku will </p><p>be "too powerful" by 2007 if he holds onto the Vice Presidency </p><p>for another four years.  IBB\'s failure to have a significant </p><p>impact on the PDP\'s candidate selection process this year will </p><p>further weaken him in the run-up to 2007, Atiku added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Atiku asserted that he had been "leading them along" </p><p>for seven months, planning all along to stick with Obasanjo </p><p>but allowing Obasanjo\'s adversaries to think they might be </p><p>divided.  By the time they discovered that Obasanjo and Atiku </p><p>were staying together, it was too late for Babangida, Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed and others to implement a back-up plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Atiku said many PDP stalwarts, especially Governors, </p><p>pushed him to announce a bid for the Presidential nomination </p><p>during the first 36 hours of the convention.  He had told them </p><p>he could not abandon Obasanjo because doing so would split the </p><p>country.  "In the end, I am a patriot, and I cannot do that." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) While agreeing with DCM\'s assessment that the ultimate </p><p>result of the convention and his role in achieving it had </p><p>boosted his profile in a political arena where appearances </p><p>play a key role, Atiku contended that this did not help him. </p><p>"I want to be underestimated; that is how I get things done." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Atiku assessed ANPP Presidential candidate Muhammadu </p><p>Buhari\'s chances as slim.  The retired general and former Head </p><p>of State has no base outside the Northwest and, therefore, </p><p>cannot win.  Atiku said he was "blackmailing" politicians and </p><p>businessmen from that zone with this "fact," pushing them to </p><p>return to the PDP so that the Northwest might contribute to </p><p>Obasanjo\'s victory rather than having to live with the </p><p>inevitable despite their best efforts to prevent it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  If Atiku truly was "leading them along" for </p><p>seven months, then he is an actor of extraordinary skill and </p><p>breadth who played deftly nuanced performances before Obasanjo </p><p>allies, Obasanjo adversaries and foreign observers alike.  We </p><p>agree, however, that he benefited from being underestimated, </p><p>particularly vis-a-vis Babangida.  As concerns that former </p><p>Head of State, Atiku\'s assessment of Babangida\'s diminution </p><p>accords generally with our own.  The "Maradonna" of Nigerian </p><p>politics appears increasingly desperate to remain relevant - </p><p>or at least to make the general public think he is.  Having </p><p>failed to control the PDP convention from his Minna mansion, </p><p>he recently told the media that he had been "born again" and </p><p>now supported the idea of a sovereign national conference: </p><p>Anything to keep the ball in play.  As for Buhari, his base of </p><p>strength may be just as narrow as Atiku describes.  His hopes </p><p>for victory rest, therefore, almost entirely on being able to </p><p>exploit fully Obasanjo\'s loss of political credibility and </p><p>popularity.  Thus far, however, his close advisors (all true </p><p>believers) seem to think that voters will flock to Buhari </p><p>simply because he is not Obasanjo (and from the North) and </p><p>apparently do not perceive a need to present a positive </p><p>agenda.  So far, Buhari\'s Presidential campaign has been </p><p>dormant. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
