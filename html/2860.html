SUMMARY: IN A CORDIAL FIRST MEETING, AMBASSADOR </p><p>BURGHARDT AND HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY NGUYEN </p><p>MINH TRIET DISCUSSED THE ROLE OF THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY, CORRUPTION, INVESTMENT AND THE BTA, </p><p>AND THE DIRECTION OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. TRIET </p><p>STRESSED THE GRASSROOTS NATURE OF VIETNAMESE COMMUNISM. </p><p>BESIDES SERVING AS THE HCMC PARTY CHIEF, TRIET IS THE </p><p>FOURTH-RANKING MEMBER OF VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL COMMUNIST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00471  01 OF 02  061031Z </p><p>PARTY POLITBURO. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GRASSROOTS DECISION MAKING </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY NGUYEN MINH TRIET </p><p>WELCOMED AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT (ACCOMPANIED BY CG, DPO, </p><p>AND CONOFFS/NOTETAKERS) TO HCMC PARTY HEADQUARTERS, </p><p>LOCATED IN THE FORMER U.S. DCM\'S RESIDENCE. OPENING THE </p><p>DISCUSSION, THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT HE KNOWS TRIET </p><p>LIKES TO SPEAK FRANKLY ON BIG ISSUES, AND ASKED TRIET </p><p>TO DISCUSS THE ROLE OF THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>(CPV) VIS-A-VIS THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT. TRIET STATED </p><p>THREE IMPORTANT ROLES FOR THE CENTRAL PARTY COMMITTEE: </p><p>TO PLAN PROVINCIAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, MONITOR THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY IMPLEMENTATION, AND </p><p>ENSURE THE CPV FUNCTIONS ACCORDING TO ITS OWN RULES. HE </p><p>NOTED SIMILARITIES WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>STRUCTURE, BUT EMPHASIZED THE ROLE OF LOCAL LEADERSHIP </p><p>AS A KEY PART OF CPV DECISION MAKING IN VIETNAM. THE </p><p>PARTY COMMITTEE PLANS OVERALL POLICIES FOR THE </p><p>PROVINCES AND LOCALITIES, BUT LOCAL DECISIONS ARE BASED </p><p>ON GRASSROOTS OPINION. THE PARTY COMMITTEE RESPONDS TO </p><p>LOCAL CONCERNS AND WILL INSPECT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>STRUCTURE IF PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY WITH ITS DECISIONS. </p><p>THE PARTY COMMITTEE MONITORS MEMBERS\' ACTIVITIES TO </p><p>ENSURE ADHERENCE TO CPV TENETS, AND THE CPV PUNISHES </p><p>CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY IN THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE AMBASSADOR ASKED TRIET ABOUT CORRUPTION IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  HE SUGGESTED THAT ASIAN COUNTRIES HAVE FOUND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00471  01 OF 02  061031Z </p><p>THAT THE WAY TO BEGIN TO COMBAT CORRUPTION IS BY PAYING </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DECENT SALARIES AND ENSURING CLEAR </p><p>PUNISHMENT FOR VIOLATIONS.  THE HARD PART IS EXPOSING </p><p>CORRUPTION.  IN THE U.S., A FREE PRESS AND INDEPENDENT </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ACT AS WATCHDOGS, BUT IN A HIGHLY </p><p>REGULATED SOCIETY, THERE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR </p><p>CORRUPTION. </p><p> </p><p>4. TRIET ACKNOWLEDGED CORRUPTION IN VIETNAM AND CITED </p><p>LOW SALARIES AS ONE REASON. STILL THERE WAS A LIMIT AS </p><p>TO HOW FAR THE GOVERNMENT COULD GO IN RAISING </p><p>GOVERNMENT SALARIES, AS THERE WOULD BE NOTHING LEFT FOR </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND STIMULATING THE ECONOMY. </p><p>HE DESCRIBED THE GRASSROOTS ROLE OF THE CPV, AS WELL AS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE FATHERLAND FRONT, IN PROTECTING </p><p>CITIZENS\' RIGHTS AND FIGHTING CORRUPTION. THE CPV SENDS </p><p>OUT "EVALUATION FORMS" FOR NEIGHBORHOODS TO COMMENT ON </p><p>THEIR LOCAL PARTY LEADERS - EVEN A PARTY LEADER\'S </p><p>SPOUSE AND CHILDREN ARE FAIR GAME.  ORGANIZATIONS LIKE </p><p>THE FATHERLAND FRONT MEET WITH NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS </p><p>ON THE UPCOMING NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS TO LISTEN </p><p>TO THEIR CRITICISMS AND CONCERNS.  IN HIS ONLY </p><p>HISTORICAL ASIDE, TRIET NOTED THAT VIETNAM LACKS </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN GOOD GOVERNANCE "DUE TO THE LONG WAR," </p><p>BUT ADDED THE COUNTRY WANTS TO LEARN GOOD GOVERNANCE </p><p>TACTICS FROM THE WEST. </p><p> </p><p>BTA - A STRONG ECONOMIC CONNECTION WILL HELP THE </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00471  01 OF 02  061031Z </p><p>5. TURNING TO THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA), THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED BTA IMPLEMENTATION AS ONE OF HIS </p><p>PRIORITIES.  HE NOTED THAT AMERICAN COMPANIES IN CHINA </p><p>PLAYED AN ADVOCACY ROLE FOR CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION </p><p>TO BENEFIT THEIR BUSINESSES. BY COMPARISON, THERE ARE </p><p>FEW U.S. COMPANIES IN VIETNAM WHO WOULD TRY TO </p><p>INFLUENCE CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION REGARDING VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  TRIET NOTED THAT CHINA HAD BEEN INDEPENDENT LONGER, </p><p>SO ITS ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. WAS </p><p>NATURALLY MORE MATURE.  HE SAID A STRONG ECONOMIC </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S., LED BY THE BTA, WILL PAVE </p><p>THE WAY FOR VIETNAM\'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  HOWEVER, WITH THE "NEGATIVE REACTION" OF </p><p>SOME OVERSEAS VIETNAMESE TO THE BTA, THE U.S. HAS A </p><p>"RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY" TO EXPLAIN THE NEW BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP TO THEM, AND TO CURB THEIR "COUNTER- </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES".  THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE SECTOR AS THE BEST </p><p>WAY TO ATTRACT FDI.  TRIET ADDED THAT THE PARTY CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE HAD PLANNED FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP THE PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR AND HAD CONFIRMED THE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS OF </p><p>HCMC\'S RAPID PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ROOM FOR GROWTH IN THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED THAT MUCH WORK REMAINED TO </p><p>BE DONE IN THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, WHICH WAS STILL </p><p>NOT TOTALLY NORMALIZED IN MANY RESPECTS.  DISTRUST </p><p>STILL EXISTS ON BOTH SIDES, HAMPERING COORDINATION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00471  02 OF 02  061031Z </p><p>BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE </p><p>MILITARY-TO-MILITARY RELATIONSHIP. TRIET AGREED THAT </p><p>THERE WERE MANY POSITIVE ASPECTS TO THE RELATIONSHIP, </p><p>BUT THE HISTORICAL LEGACY REMAINED AN OBSTACLE. </p><p> </p><p>8. THE AMBASSADOR AND TRIET AGREED TO MEET AGAIN FOR A </p><p>FRANK AND CANDID DISCUSSION, WITH TRIET CALLING THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR A "BRIDGE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM." </p><p> </p><p>9. COMMENT:  TRIET IS A MODERN POLITBURO MEMBER WHO </p><p>BELIEVES IN TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC INTEGRATION INTO THE </p><p>WORLD MARKET.  WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE A FRONTRUNNER FOR </p><p>VIETNAM\'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER, HIS EMPHASIS ON THE </p><p>GRASSROOTS NATURE OF THE CPV\'S DECISION-MAKING PROCESS </p><p>APPEARED TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO CAST THE CPV AS A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC BODY RATHER THAN AS THE UNYIELDING, OPAQUE </p><p>STRUCTURE THAT IT IS.  END COMMENT.  YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
