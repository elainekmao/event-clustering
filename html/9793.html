<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001303 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MASS, LI, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PLANNING FOR LIBERIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 213493 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 1283 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA DAWN LIBERI; REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) According to current GON planning, the 19th </p><p>Motorized Infantry battalion (i.e. NIBATT 15 in UNAMSIL) </p><p>and the 26th Infantry battalion from Sokoto will deploy to </p><p>Monrovia.  Combined manpower of the two battalions is 1,375 </p><p>men.  The GON had indicated a willingness to deploy OFR- </p><p>trained NIBATT 14 from Sierra Leone to Liberia based on our </p><p>request; however, apparently UNAMSIL has opposed the </p><p>redeployment of NIBATT 14 to Liberia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DATT discussed the Liberia deployment with Chief of </p><p>Army Staff (COAS) LTG Agwai July 29 (REF B).  The COAS </p><p>could not give a definitive date for the Nigerian </p><p>deployment as their planning has not been finalized and </p><p>much of it is dependent on external factors such as </p><p>provision of logistical support and lift from prospective </p><p>international donors.  However, the COAS seemed less </p><p>committed to the Nigerian general staff\'s previous </p><p>endorsement of a "backward planning sequence" which would </p><p>make Nigerian deployment dependent on a reliable timetable </p><p>for the follow-on deployments from fellow ECOWAS states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The COAS said the Nigerians would not need </p><p>uniforms, personnel equipment, basic medical support, field </p><p>kitchens or weapons.  He said the GON would be able to find </p><p>enough soft-skinned vehicles for the Sokoto battalion; he </p><p>did not know the status of NIBATT 15\'s vehicles.  He also </p><p>said the Sokoto battalion would deploy with minimal basic </p><p>load of ammunition, and would need resupply quickly once in </p><p>Liberia.  The Sokoto battalion is at 90% personnel </p><p>readiness and could deploy as soon as equipment and </p><p>transport issues have been resolved.  Finally, Agwai said </p><p>the GON could provide 24-30 Warsaw Pact infantry fighting </p><p>vehicles (BMPs) for Liberia but needed assistance with </p><p>transport and ammunition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The COAS said the Nigerian battalions would require </p><p>further donor support in the way of attack helicopters, at </p><p>least one transport helicopter for the Force Commander </p><p>(Nigerian BG Okwonko), logistics support to include </p><p>ammunition resupply in Liberia, communications, air and sea </p><p>lift for the battalion and armored personnel carriers, </p><p>ammunition for the APCs and barrier material. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Post has been unable to raise pertinent reftel </p><p>points with ECOWAS Executive Secretary Chambas or MG Diarra </p><p>due to their prolonged absence from Abuja and presence in </p><p>Accra.  Post would suggest that Embassy Accra also attempt </p><p>to raise these points with Chambas and/or Diarra if </p><p>possible.  Post will continue to press ECOWAS and the GON </p><p>for a quick deployment and will report further as more </p><p>information becomes available. </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
