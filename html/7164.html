<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000680 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "What liberation?" the pro- </p><p>      government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its </p><p>      April 6 editorial to condemning the United States-led </p><p>      war against Iraq, charging that the war is "creating </p><p>      untold hardships" for the Iraqis.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .Adamantly sticking to their self-serving </p><p>      perceptions as liberators of the people of </p><p>      Iraq, rather than the invaders that they are, </p><p>      the Americans and their allies have pushed into </p><p>      the Iraqi capital, where they have bombed out </p><p>      critical public amenities, creating untold </p><p>      hardships for the people they claim to have </p><p>      come to liberate. . .  President Bush openly </p><p>      admitted to the American public that this could </p><p>      be a long war.  This means that the longer it </p><p>      takes, the more suffering that would be visited </p><p>      upon the people of Iraq.  It, therefore, </p><p>      defeats logic that Bush should announce the </p><p>      imminent `liberation\' of the Iraqis when, in </p><p>      fact, they are set to suffer more hardships </p><p>      under Anglo-American occupation." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
