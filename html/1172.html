(C) ON JUNE 23 DCM DELIVERED A DEMARCHE TO MINISTRY </p><p>OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS UNDER SECRETARY FOR AFRICA DAVID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03448  230924Z </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI PER REFTEL INSTRUCTION.  DCM ALSO LEFT A </p><p>NON-PAPER CONTAINING POINTS IN PARAS 1 AND 3 FOR HIS </p><p>CONSIDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) HAMADZIRIPI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT, "THIS IS A VERY </p><p>DIFFICULT SITUATION."  HE NOTED THAT ZIMBABWE WAS </p><p>CONCERNED THAT CLOSURE OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE FACILITATOR </p><p>SIR KETUMILE MASIRE\'S OFFICE IN KINSHASA PUTS A DAMPER </p><p>ON THE MOMENTUM INDUCED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS.  THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMAT STRESSED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>SUPPORTED THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>WAS A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE PEACE AGREEMENT, AND </p><p>HAD ENCOURAGED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC </p><p>OF THE CONGO TO WORK WITH MASIRE TO ACHIEVE A POLITICAL </p><p>SOLUTION.  IN ZIMBABWE\'S ANALYSIS, THE PROBLEM STEMS </p><p>FROM THE FACT THAT THE ROLE OF THE FACILITATOR WAS FROM </p><p>THE BEGINNING NEVER MADE VERY CLEAR.  IN JANUARY THE </p><p>POLITICAL COMMITTEE ATTEMPTED TO CLARIFY IT, BUT </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY NOT SUCCESSFULLY.  THE CONGOLESE, WHO HE </p><p>SAID RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR A FACILITATOR, NEVERTHELESS </p><p>REQUIRED THAT INDIVIDUAL TO RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORITY AND </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY OF THE KABILA GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FOR REASONS THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS DID NOT FULLY </p><p>UNDERSTAND, KINSHASA HAD LOST CONFIDENCE IN MASIRE THE </p><p>PERSON, AS FACILITATOR.  INDEED, THE CONGOLESE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER HAD CALLED HIM THE "COMPLICATOR" AT A RECENT </p><p>POLITICAL COMMITTEE MEETING IN LUSAKA.  THE ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>QUESTIONED WHETHER IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO RESTORE </p><p>KABILA\'S TRUST IN MASIRE; HAMADZIRIPI THOUGHT NOT, AND </p><p>IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE CONGOLESE HEAD OF STATE WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03448  230924Z </p><p>CONTINUE TO CHECK HIS EVERY MOVE.  THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>DIPLOMAT SEEMED AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT THE NEXT STEPS </p><p>MIGHT BE TO RECTIFY THIS PROBLEM, AND DOUBTED HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO PERSUADE KABILA TO REVERSE </p><p>HIS DECISION AND COOPERATE WITH MASIRE.  "WE FIND </p><p>OURSELVES IN A CRISIS," HE CONCLUDED, "BUT ZIMBABWE WILL </p><p>DO WHAT IT CAN SO THE PROCESS IS CARRIED FORWARD". </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
