REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>RALLY </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) APPROXIMATELY 20,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED A PEACEFUL RALLY HELD </p><p>BY THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>30 TO CELEBRATE THE PARTY\'S ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY.  MDC MEMBER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT TENDAI BITI TOLD POLOFF THAT POLICE HARASSMENT HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN AS BAD AS HE EXPECTED.  HIS ONLY COMPLAINT WAS THAT POLICE </p><p>ROADBLOCKS MOUNTED AROUND TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE RALLY MIGHT </p><p>HAVE SCARED SOME PEOPLE AWAY.  ACCORDING TO BITI, RALLY PARTICIPANTS </p><p>CALLED OVERWHELMINGLY FOR MASS ACTION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS </p><p>WEEK THE MDC\'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WILL DISCUSS WHAT KIND OF ACTION </p><p>TO ORGANIZE AND WHEN IT WILL TAKE PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) BOTH THE INDEPENDENT AND GOVERNMENT PRESS QUOTED TSVANGIRAI </p><p>AS DECLARING AT THE RALLY THAT "MUGABE SHOULD GO PEACEFULLY.  IF HE </p><p>DOES NOT, WE WILL REMOVE HIM VIOLENTLY."  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS </p><p>REACTED STRONGLY, WITH POLICE SPOKESMAN WAYNE BVUDZIJENA ANNOUNCING </p><p>THAT TSVANGIRAI COULD FACE ARREST AND PROSECUTION FOR ADVOCATING THE </p><p>VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF THE PRESIDENT.  A ZANU-PF SPOKESMAN CRITICIZED </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S REMARKS AS A "SHOCKING STATEMENT FROM A PERSON WHO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CLAIMS TO BE DEMOCRATIC" AND VOWED THAT HIS PARTY WOULD "ANSWER </p><p>VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MDC CHAIRMAN ISAAC MATONGO SAT BESIDE TSVANGIRAI AT THE </p><p>RALLY.  HE TOLD POLOFF ON OCTOBER 2 THAT TSVANGIRAI HAD MEANT THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05585  021019Z </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE SHOULD GO PEACEFULLY BUT IF NOT, ZIMBABWEANS, WHO </p><p>ARE FED UP WITH THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC DECLINE AND POLITICAL </p><p>INSTABILITY, WOULD FORCE HIM TO GO.  THE MDC, TSVANGIRAI HAD </p><p>IMPLIED, WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTAIN PEOPLE IF MUGABE CONTINUED TO </p><p>HOLD ON TO POWER.  MATONGO EMPHASIZED THAT THE MDC PRESIDENT HAS </p><p>RESISTED AND WOULD CONTINUE TO RESIST CALLS FROM MDC SUPPORTERS TO </p><p>RESORT TO VIOLENCE AGAINST THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT.  THE GOZ, MATONGO </p><p>SAID, WAS TWISTING TSVANGIRAI\'S WORDS IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EXCUSE TO </p><p>CRACK DOWN ON HIM AND THE OPPOSITION PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AT THE SEPTEMBER 30 RALLY, TSVANGIRAI APPARENTLY GOT CAUGHT </p><p>UP IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT AND SAID SOMETHING THAT COULD BE </p><p>MISINTERPRETED BY THOSE WHO SEEK TO DO SO.  ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT TSVANGIRAI IS COMMITTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND </p><p>THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT THROUGH PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC MEANS, HE HAS </p><p>GIVEN A GOVERNMENT SALIVATING FOR A CHANCE TO LOCK HIM UP AN EXCUSE </p><p>TO DO SO WITH A VENEER OF LEGALITY.  POLICE SAY THEY ARE STUDYING </p><p>HIS SPEECH TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS JUSTIFICATION FOR BRINGING </p><p>CHARGES AGAINST HIM.  MEANWHILE, WE WILL STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH </p><p>THE MDC AS THE PARTY DEVELOPS ITS PLANS AND TIMETABLE FOR MASS </p><p>ACTION.  ADDITIONALLY, THE AMBASSADOR WILL CONTINUE TO URGE </p><p>TSVANGIRAI TO ACT IN A MEASURED WAY AND EXERCISE RESTRAINT.  END </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
