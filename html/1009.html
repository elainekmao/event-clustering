<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 002324 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR SUTPHIN </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA AMB. TWINING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/20/O2 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PHUM, CE </p><p>SUBJECT: LTTE MASSACRES 54 CIVILIANS IN EASTERN PROVINCE </p><p>NEAR AMPARA </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) COLOMBO 2306, (B) COLOMBO 2269 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: THE LTTE ATTACKED SLEEPING VILLAGERS IN </p><p>GONAGALA DURING EARLY MORNING HOURS OF SEPTEMBER 18, </p><p>HACKING TO DEATH 54 CIVILIANS INCLUDING WOMEN AND </p><p>CHILDREN.  LOCALS HAVE ASSAILED THE GOVERNMENT FOR </p><p>FAILING TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SECURITY.  ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, TAMILS HAVE CRITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS </p><p>ENERGETIC RESPONSE TO THE LTTE ATTACK EVEN AS IT HAS </p><p>REMAINED SILENT ABOUT THE AIR FORCE\'S ACCIDENTAL BOMBING </p><p>OF TAMIL CIVILIANS IN THE NORTH ON SEPTEMBER 15.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) LTTE CADRES ENTERED THE SINHALESE VILLAGE OF </p><p>GONAGALA, APPROXIMATELY 13 KILOMETRES NORTH OF AMPARA </p><p>(NEAR THE DISTRICT BORDER WITH BATTICALOA) IN EASTERN </p><p>SRI LANKA, BETWEEN O13O AND O430 SATURDAY MORNING, </p><p>SEPTEMBER 18.  REPORTEDLY DRAGGING SOME OF THEIR VICTIMS </p><p>SLEEPING FROM THEIR BEDS, THE LTTE KILLED 54 CIVILIANS </p><p>USING LONG KNIVES, SWORDS AND MACHETES.  THE VICTIMS </p><p>INCLUDED 14 CHILDREN UNDER FIVE YEARS OF AGE, 17 WOMEN </p><p>AND 23 MEN.  THIRTY-EIGHT OTHER PERSONS WERE ALSO </p><p>INJURED.  DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER RATWATTE VISITED THE </p><p>VILLAGE SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND WAS ACCOSTED BY ANGRY </p><p>VILLAGERS ASKING, "IS THIS THE SECURITY YOU ARE </p><p>PROVIDING US?"  HE PROMISED TO SEND MORE HOME GUARDS TO </p><p>THE AREA. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SECURITY SOURCES TOLD EMBOFF THEY SUSPECTED THE </p><p>ATTACK WAS THE WORK OF ABOUT 6O LOCAL LTTE CADRES. </p><p>GIVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME OF THE ATTACK AND GONAGALA\'S </p><p>DISTANCE FROM KNOWN LTTE AREAS OF OPERATION, THEY THINK </p><p>IT UNLIKELY A STRIKE FORCE CAME DOWN FROM THE UNCLEARED </p><p>AREA ALONG THE COAST SOUTH OF BATTICALOA FOR THE ATTACK. </p><p>THE SECURITY FORCES ARE CONTINUING THEIR SEARCH </p><p>OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE ATTACK WAS WIDELY CONDEMNED.  PRESIDENT </p><p>KUMARATUNGA OFFERED HER CONDOLENCES ("I WAS DEEPLY </p><p>GRIEVED TO HEAR OF THE DEATHS"), SAYING "ALL CIVILIZED </p><p>SOCIETIES WOULD, NO DOUBT, DEPLORE CRIMES OF THIS TYPE </p><p>WITH UTTER CONTEMPT."  THE TAMIL UNITED LIBERATION FRONT </p><p>(TULF) AND OTHER TAMIL COMMENTATORS, HOWEVER, CONTRASTED </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S STATEMENT AND OTHER EXPRESSIONS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONCERN FOR THE VICTIMS (PROMISES OF </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THEIR FAMILIES) WITH THE OFFICIAL SILENCE </p><p>AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 15 AIR FORCE BOMBING OF TAMIL </p><p>CIVILIANS IN THE NORTH WHERE 22 CIVILIANS WERE KILLED </p><p>(REF A). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: MOST OBSERVERS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>MILITARY SOURCES, VIEW THIS LATEST LTTE OUTRAGE AS </p><p>DIRECT RETALIATION FOR THE SEPTEMBER 15 BOMBING.  WHILE </p><p>THAT MAY BE TRUE, THE LTTE ACTION DEMONSTRATES ONCE </p><p>AGAIN ITS ABILITY TO STRIKE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  BY </p><p>REVISITING GONAGALA  (A SMALL VILLAGE SURROUNDED BY </p><p>TAMIL ONES IN THE JUNGLE WHERE THE LTTE PASSED THROUGH A </p><p>YEAR AGO) FAR AWAY FROM THE FRONT LINES, THE LTTE ALSO </p><p>SPOTLIGHTED SHORTCOMINGS IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S SECURITY </p><p>BLANKET IN THE EAST.  THIS WILL LIKELY INCREASE PRESSURE </p><p>ON THE GOVERNMENT TO MOVE MORE TROOPS FROM THE NORTH AND </p><p>PERHAPS FROM THE OFFENSIVE LINES TO INCREASE LOCAL </p><p>SECURITY IN THE EAST (REF B).  THE WEEKEND PRESS CARRIED </p><p>MANY CRITICAL STORIES OF THE SHORT-LIVED (24 HOURS) </p><p>RECENT OFFENSIVE ("RANA GOSHA V") SUGGESTING IT HAD </p><p>FALLEN SHORT OF ITS OBJECTIVE AND TROOPS HAD RETREATED. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THIS MASSACRE COULD WELL PROVE TO BE THE </p><p>LTTE\'S MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPON IN PREVENTING ADDITIONAL </p><p>SUCH OFFENSIVES FROM OCCURRING BEFORE THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>MONSOON.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>DONNELLY </p><p></p></div>
