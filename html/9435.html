<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 002007 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE </p><p> </p><p>FOR ECA/PE/V/P - MARGERY BENSON; ECA/PE/V/G/W - EWILKES- </p><p>SCOTT; INFO WHA/PDA - WWANLUND </p><p>MONTREAL FOR PAO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OEXC, SCUL, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: FY 2003 IV MRP "MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY" EVALUATION </p><p>FOR JEAN-PHILIPPE RACICOT </p><p> </p><p>A.   DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: 21-day multi-regional program </p><p>on "U.S. Perspectives on Multilateral Diplomacy Issues," </p><p>participant Jean-Philippe Racicot, Analyst (U.S.), Western </p><p>Hemisphere Intelligence Assessment Secretariat, Privy </p><p>Council Office, Canada. </p><p> </p><p>B.   DATE, FISCAL YEAR AND QUARTER: May 8-29, 2003; FY-03, </p><p>Quarter three </p><p> </p><p>C.   JUSTIFICATION AND OBJECTIVE: At the time he was </p><p>nominated, Mr. Racicot was one of few international </p><p>observers in Quebec who could claim a solid background in </p><p>defense matters, with expertise ranging from NATO expansion </p><p>issues to North American defense and Iraq\'s weapons of mass </p><p>destruction.  An academic frequently featured on news </p><p>programs, Mr. Racicot gains followers by being able to </p><p>tailor his explanations to his audiences. </p><p> </p><p>Having recently made a transition from academia into the </p><p>federal government, Mr. Racicot will continue to inform </p><p>Canadian policymaking through his keen analysis and </p><p>exploration of international issues. </p><p> </p><p>D.   MPP THEME: National security; economic prosperity; </p><p>    global issues </p><p> </p><p>E.   RESULT/IMPACT:  A U.S. watcher for many years, Mr. </p><p>Racicot had little direct experience with Americans.  For </p><p>him, this international visitor program delivered both </p><p>insightful discussion of U.S. policy and society and </p><p>enlightening first-hand contact with Americans, from neo- </p><p>cons to ultra liberals, from urban elites to ranchers.  In </p><p>addition, he gained from interaction with the diverse group </p><p>of participants in the MRP. </p><p> </p><p>An academic by training, Mr. Racicot appreciated the well- </p><p>prepared briefings the group received from the Council on </p><p>Foreign Relations (he learned more there in an hour than in </p><p>a day of other briefings), the Near East Institute </p><p>(brilliant speaker), and the Georgetown professor who </p><p>offered a condensed course in federalism and civics.  Beyond </p><p>the briefings, Mr. Racicot particularly enjoyed encounters </p><p>with Americans, the hallmark of the IV program, from the </p><p>stimulating discussants at Exxon-Mobil and the Oil and Gas </p><p>Journal to Bubba, the world-traveled Brahman cattle rancher; </p><p>gun shop owners; and the retired viola player who offered </p><p>him home hospitality.  (Mr. Racicot also appreciated the pre- </p><p>program appointments WHA/PD set up for him at the State </p><p>Department and the American Enterprise Institute.) </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Racicot relayed his deep satisfaction with the Houston </p><p>and New York programs as well as his disappointment with the </p><p>Seattle program, where staff at a U.S. Senator\'s office </p><p>provided a superficial briefing and visits to Weyerhauser, </p><p>Starbucks or Boeing did not materialize. He did very much </p><p>enjoy home hospitality in Seattle, however. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Racicot came home with a sense of the diversity and </p><p>vigor of the United States, and a newfound appreciation for </p><p>the widespread change in attitude towards world affairs </p><p>wrought by the events of September 2001.  The post is </p><p>confident that his experience and the contacts he made will </p><p>make a solid contribution to his ability to interpret U.S. </p><p>policy and events in coming years. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
