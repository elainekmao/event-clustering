<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 LAGOS 000147 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, BEXP, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  The Economy in 2003:  Triumph of Politics </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary. The economic outlook for the New Year is </p><p>cloudy. Academic experts and business leaders fear that </p><p>Nigeria will experience little if any real per capita </p><p>growth in 2003. They bemoan Nigeria\'s OPEC oil </p><p>production quota of 1.9 million barrels per day, which </p><p>limits the country\'s potential oil exports. These </p><p>experts fear even more what they say are irresponsible </p><p>fiscal policies despite President Obasanjo\'s relative </p><p>frugality. Central Bank data show that such policies </p><p>are putting Nigeria on shaky economic ground as it </p><p>heads toward 2003. Nigerian economists we have talked </p><p>to do not expect a policy change during the next </p><p>quarter, which will be the last before critical federal </p><p>and state elections in April 2003. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Real Economy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The economic clouds of 2002 have obscured the view </p><p>of likely economic activity in the New Year. In early </p><p>November 2002, IMF experts estimated that Nigeria\'s </p><p>gross domestic product would decline 0.9 percent in </p><p>real terms in 2002 owing to falling oil revenues. This </p><p>figure, if confirmed, will be in stark contrast to the </p><p>3.8 percent growth achieved in 2001.  The Central Bank </p><p>has challenged the IMF figure and forecasts 3.2 percent </p><p>growth for 2002.  Its basis for optimism is that non- </p><p>oil sector output may have risen 5.3 percent in 2002, </p><p>buoyed by a 4.1 percent increase in agricultural </p><p>production owing to favorable rainfall. (The </p><p>discrepancy points to the weak database and less than </p><p>robust analysis.)  The GON also points to the dynamism </p><p>of the telecommunications sector, which was energized </p><p>by deregulation and the introduction of GSM telephone </p><p>systems. Both the IMF and the GON recognize that the </p><p>manufacturing sector remained weak in 2002, as capacity </p><p>utilization did not exceed 41 percent during the year. </p><p>Partly because of this fact, there is increasing </p><p>consensus among Nigerians on the need to accelerate </p><p>privatization, and market determination of the exchange </p><p>and interest rates.  The Dutch Action System (DAS), </p><p>which was introduced in mid 2002 to deal with the </p><p>pressure on the exchange rate, has facilitated improved </p><p>management of the exchange rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Whether one uses the IMF or Central Bank figures, </p><p>the data still point to a setting in which purchasing </p><p>power remains weak. Not only is the annual per capita </p><p>income of the Nigerian population estimated to be below </p><p>300 USD, its rate of growth approximates only 2.8 </p><p>percent a year. Consequently, the optimistic 3.2 </p><p>percent growth results in only a 0.4 percent rise in </p><p>per capita income under the better of the two scenarios </p><p>mentioned above. At such a low rate of increase, </p><p>Nigerians are condemned virtually to perpetual poverty. </p><p>It is a far cry from the 7.2 percent real per capita </p><p>income growth that Nigerians would need to experience </p><p>continually over the next ten years to double their </p><p>income within a decade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  To achieve 7-10 percent real growth in any given </p><p>year calls for an environment conducive to business. </p><p>Last year\'s has not been so, according to Doyin Salami, </p><p>a macroeconomics professor at the Lagos Business </p><p>School. In mid-November, he shared data with us and </p><p>business executives that showed that private sector </p><p>turnover had just kept pace with inflation during the </p><p>first half of 2002. A Lagos Business School survey of </p><p>fast moving consumer goods then disclosed that the </p><p>fastest moving items (like powdered milk) were </p><p>necessities being packaged in ever smaller containers </p><p>to be within reach of consumers\' falling purchasing </p><p>power. Expenditure switching was associated with this </p><p>decline in sales volume, Salami asserted. Companies </p><p>marketing consumer goods had to lower their margins in </p><p>2002 to attract buyers since many poor people chose to </p><p>buy goods like GSM telephones rather than essential </p><p>items, notwithstanding their low level of income. </p><p>Consequently, unadjusted profits for the non-financial </p><p>sector fell by 6.4 percent during the period, he said. </p><p>The ratio of losers to winners during this time was </p><p>three to one, he added. A report appearing in the </p><p>December 30 issue of Business Day carried the headline, </p><p>"Economic Lull Impacts on Companies\' Profits." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Except for cases in which the purchase of cellular </p><p>phones facilitates earning a living, other instances of </p><p>inessential purchases may rightly be considered </p><p>conspicuous spending.  Such spending affects aggregate </p><p>growth only at the margin. The reason is simple: there </p><p>are simply too few Nigerians with substantial </p><p>purchasing power. Salami and his better-known colleague </p><p>at the business school, Pat Utomi, presented data </p><p>bearing out this point. Regarding distribution of </p><p>wealth, Salami said the richest four-percent of the </p><p>population in Nigeria possesses 48 percent of the </p><p>country\'s wealth. The next cohort accounts for 46 </p><p>percent of the population and holds 44 percent of the </p><p>wealth. The bottom 50 percent of the population </p><p>accounts for 8 percent of the wealth. This highly </p><p>skewed distribution of wealth is sub-optimal with </p><p>respect to economic growth. Since the richest cohort\'s </p><p>propensity and ability to import is much larger than </p><p>that of the other two- thirds of the population, much </p><p>of the income of the top four percent of the population </p><p>helps to sustain foreign economies, not Nigeria. But </p><p>this group is numerically so small that it absorbs </p><p>little of Nigeria\'s manufactured products.  This group </p><p>also generally disdains Nigerian goods and will buy </p><p>imported items whenever it can, further compounding the </p><p>problem. Its savings or surplus income, which accounts </p><p>for a large proportion of total private savings, is </p><p>consequently often channeled abroad. Such capital </p><p>flight further holds back Nigeria\'s economic growth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  There is another dysfunctional form of conspicuous </p><p>spending in Nigeria: that for political position.  In </p><p>many other countries, people with money invest in </p><p>industry or services as these sectors of economic </p><p>activity generate wealth.  In Nigeria, however, many </p><p>people with money invest directly in the political </p><p>sector or indirectly by backing politically ambitious </p><p>individuals.  It is common knowledge that in Nigeria </p><p>politics can be the short road to massive wealth. How </p><p>else can one account for the substantial cost of recent </p><p>electoral activity in Nigeria?  Funding of it, whether </p><p>originally through a draw down of foreign exchange </p><p>reserves, has been distributed primarily in naira to </p><p>advance the political prospects of various people. An </p><p>Emboff\'s informed estimate of the cost of the Peoples </p><p>Democratic Party convention in Abuja last week is that </p><p>it approximated 60 million USD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Continuing in this vein, Utomi added that statistics </p><p>show that funding for the federal, state, and local </p><p>governments has quadrupled since 1998, yet little of it </p><p>is used productively. (Central Bank data confirm that </p><p>the revenues that accrued to the state and local </p><p>governments increased by a factor of four in nominal </p><p>terms during 1997-2001. Federal government revenues </p><p>nearly doubled during the same period.  The greater </p><p>distribution of revenue to state and local governments </p><p>during the Fourth Republic (relative to the </p><p>distribution in 1997-1998 during military rule) is </p><p>partly the result of a requirement imposed on the </p><p>federal government by the 1999 constitution.)  To make </p><p>his point, Salami referred to a value-for-money audit </p><p>that the IMF and the World Bank conducted in Nigeria </p><p>and said its value-for-money index was put at fourteen </p><p>percent at the Conference on Development that was held </p><p>in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002. Consequently, </p><p>little of the government revenue allocated to economic </p><p>and social services has the intended effect. (Comment. </p><p>We were told that a value-for-money coefficient of 14 </p><p>signifies that only 14 out of every 100 naira collected </p><p>by the federal government is spent effectively.  End </p><p>comment.)  According to Utomi, no more than a tenth of </p><p>the 100,000 young men and women who graduate from </p><p>Nigeria\'s post-secondary institutions every year obtain </p><p>adequate urban employment within one year of </p><p>graduation, for example. Few of these adults find </p><p>meaningful alternative employment in the rural sector </p><p>since the wages are too low to attract them. Rural </p><p>wages remain low partly because forty percent of total </p><p>agricultural production is lost owing to inadequate </p><p>infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fiscal Policy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Nigeria\'s less-than-reassuring fiscal policies are </p><p>the cause of the overcast 2003 outlook.  The central </p><p>government\'s overall budget deficit target for 2002 was </p><p>set at -446 billion naira (about 3.7 billion USD). </p><p>Reviewing the performance of the federal government </p><p>during the first part of the year, Salami showed that </p><p>the overall fiscal balance stood at minus Nl19.5 </p><p>billion (about 1.0 billion USD), which equaled 4.3 </p><p>percent of GDP (assuming 3.2 percent real growth in </p><p>2002). This figure for the deficit appeared in the </p><p>Central Bank\'s report for the first half of 2002. </p><p>Should it turn out that the target figure for 2002 was </p><p>realized, fiscal policy will have been as expansionary </p><p>in 2002 as any policy of the last four years. Although </p><p>oil revenues were 36 percent lower during the first </p><p>half of 2002 than during the first half of 2001 because </p><p>Nigeria\'s OPEC quota limited its export volume, federal </p><p>government revenues still exceeded the budget estimate </p><p>by 29.7 percent in the first six months of 2002. </p><p>However, recurrent expenditures alone rose 14 percent </p><p>during the period relative to those of the first half </p><p>of 2001. The total of recurrent expenditures and the </p><p>federal government\'s capital expenditures and net </p><p>lending "resulted in a large monetary financing of a </p><p>huge deficit" during the first half of 2002, according </p><p>to the Central Bank. More recent Central Bank data </p><p>indicate that recurrent expenditures accounted for 77.7 </p><p>percent of the central government budget and exceeded </p><p>the target by 10.6 percent during the first ten months </p><p>of 2002. Personnel costs associated with a bloated </p><p>civil service accounted for 70 percent of these </p><p>recurrent expenditures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. The Central Bank\'s announcement of late December </p><p>that the federal government had recorded a deficit of </p><p>47.5 billion naira (about 400 million USD) during the </p><p>first ten months of 2002 was unexpected, given that the </p><p>budget deficit for the first semester 2002 totaled </p><p>119.5 billion naira. The reason for the remarkable </p><p>turnaround was the inclusion in the government\'s </p><p>retained revenue of the proceeds of the sale of </p><p>external reserves and of borrowing from the banking </p><p>system. As noted in the Bank\'s report for October, "in </p><p>the ten-month period, the Federal Government </p><p>substantially drew down on its deposits with the </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria, resulting in further injection </p><p>of liquidity in the banking system." Although Obasanjo </p><p>slashed capital expenditures during the first nine </p><p>months of 2002, we expect that the data for the last </p><p>quarter will show that the federal government\'s net </p><p>lending, capital expenditures, and transfers to state </p><p>and local governments will have picked up in 2002. We </p><p>further expect that this trend will continue during the </p><p>first six months of 2003 because of expenditures </p><p>associated with contracts typically awarded at the end </p><p>of a presidential administration and other handouts of </p><p>patronage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Monetary Policy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Nigerian analysts know that the Central Bank has </p><p>the unenviable task of ensuring that monetary policy </p><p>accommodates fiscal policy. Although the rate of growth </p><p>of the monetary aggregates had slowed during the first </p><p>six months of this year relative to the figures for the </p><p>first half of 2001, by the end of October broad money </p><p>(M2) had risen by 32 percent against a target of 15.3 </p><p>percent for 2002. The increases were driven by </p><p>excessive bank credit to the domestic economy; </p><p>primarily government credit, which rose 602.1 percent </p><p>during the first six months of this year relative to </p><p>the corresponding period a year ago. The Central Bank </p><p>itself subscribed to 45 percent of the treasury bills </p><p>issued during the period. Reflecting the government\'s </p><p>inability or unwillingness to make further cuts in the </p><p>budget in the light of a continuing budget deficit, </p><p>government borrowing picked up during the subsequent </p><p>four months (July-October) of 2002. Central Bank data </p><p>for October show that government credit rose a whopping </p><p>836 percent during the first ten months of 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  The crowding out of the private sector has thus </p><p>been an important feature of the money and capital </p><p>markets in 2002. Bank credit to the private sector rose </p><p>by only 8.7 percent in the first ten months of the </p><p>year, a far cry from the annual target of 34.9 percent. </p><p>Equally important was the fact that non-bank public </p><p>subscription to treasury bills rose by a factor of ten </p><p>in the first half of 2002 relative to the corresponding </p><p>period the year before. (The Central Bank\'s and </p><p>commercial banks\' subscriptions to treasury bills rose </p><p>by a factor of seven during the same period.) While it </p><p>may have appeared that the Central Bank\'s reduction of </p><p>the Minimum Rediscount Rate (MRR) by 400 basis points </p><p>in late October, to 18.5 percent, would stimulate </p><p>private sector lending, the reduction also lowered the </p><p>cost of government borrowing and so may have encouraged </p><p>such further borrowing. For these reasons, the cut in </p><p>the MRR late in the year is particularly worrisome; </p><p>such action is counter-intuitive since the budget </p><p>deficits have caused the liquidity overhang. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Bowing to political pressure, the Central Bank of </p><p>Nigeria (CBN) nonetheless further reduced the </p><p>rediscount rate to 16.5 percent in late December and </p><p>called on banks to lower the prime lending rate to MRR </p><p>+ 400 basis point. Unpublished preliminary data of the </p><p>Central Bank that we saw on December 30 indicate that </p><p>this reduction in the MRR has lowered inter-bank </p><p>lending rates. Rates have come down partly because the </p><p>first tranche of the December 2002 statutory federal </p><p>government allocation to the state and local </p><p>governments trickled into bank vaults in late December. </p><p>Professor Salami and other economists we have talked to </p><p>caution that the lower rates are unlikely to hold since </p><p>inflation and default risk drives interest rates. Since </p><p>neither of these two drivers will lose momentum during </p><p>the next six months, lending rates will remain high as </p><p>institutional investors flock to treasury bills in a </p><p>flight to quality.  Moreover, deposit banks are likely </p><p>to find ways to increase their lending rates, Salami </p><p>said. He anticipates the development of an underground </p><p>market in which loans will be extended at MMR plus 400 </p><p>basis points plus a premium to take account of erosion </p><p>of asset values induced by an expected rise in </p><p>inflation early next year. An Emboff already knows of </p><p>an instance in which a contact of his who wants to </p><p>import equipment to process cashews asserted that he </p><p>was recently quoted a rate of interest of 35 percent, </p><p>plus a 2 percent charge for documentation, and a 5 </p><p>percent transfer charge.  The interest rate plus the </p><p>charges total 42 percent, a far cry from the 20.5 prime </p><p>interest rate that the Central Bank is recommending. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Foreign Account </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Central Bank data show that Nigeria\'s trade </p><p>surplus declined 45.3 percent during the first half of </p><p>2002-to 2.6 billion USD-relative to the corresponding </p><p>period the year before. During the first six months of </p><p>2002, export revenue declined 40 percent, to 6.5 </p><p>billion USD, and imports fell 35 percent. The </p><p>invisibles account (services and income) totaled about </p><p>-4.0 billion USD and current transfers equaled 697 </p><p>million USD during the first six months of 2002. </p><p>Consequently, the current account deficit totaled 714 </p><p>million USD compared to a 1.35 billion USD surplus </p><p>during the corresponding period in 2001. As a result, </p><p>foreign exchange reserves fell from 10.45 billion USD </p><p>at the start of the year to 8.7 billion USD at the end </p><p>of June 2002. At the end of October, Nigeria\'s foreign </p><p>reserves totaled about 8.0 billion USD. A review of </p><p>Central Bank data shows that the expected trade, </p><p>current account, and overall account figures for 2002 </p><p>are likely to be as bad as any data of the last three </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. To stanch the expected outflow, the Central Bank in </p><p>July began allocating foreign exchange through a Dutch </p><p>Auction System, which has narrowed the gap to about ten </p><p>points between the parallel and official rates of </p><p>exchange throughout fall 2002. But pressure has built </p><p>up and there is no reason to expect it to decline. The </p><p>Central Bank recently re-authorized twenty-one banks to </p><p>buy foreign exchange, lifting a ban ahead of time that </p><p>had forbade these banks from engaging in such </p><p>transactions owing to violations of foreign exchange </p><p>regulations. The demand for forex by these banks will </p><p>put pressure on the naira and may lead to further </p><p>depreciation. Consequently, and given the political </p><p>uncertainty ahead, we expect that a larger than normal </p><p>volume of funds will flow out of the capital and money </p><p>markets and into the foreign exchange market during the </p><p>next several months. Such movement will test the recent </p><p>stability in the foreign exchange market, as funds </p><p>drift out of the money and capital markets in response </p><p>to the uncertain electoral prospects in spring 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. In the light of the developments mentioned above, </p><p>Professor Salami warns that Nigeria is experiencing a </p><p>"lull before a damaging storm." He cautions that the </p><p>central government might soon find itself unable to use </p><p>foreign reserves as the primary mechanism to manage the </p><p>exchange rate. Nigeria\'s foreign reserves rose slightly </p><p>in November relative to October, but the volume remains </p><p>close to the CBN\'s self-imposed minimum six-month limit </p><p>necessary to sustain imports. We expect a further </p><p>temporary rise in foreign exchange as a result of the </p><p>recent spike in oil prices and slightly larger OPEC </p><p>quota for Nigeria, which will yield larger revenues, </p><p>and repatriated funds associated with the end of year </p><p>holidays. These flows, associated with the seasonal </p><p>weakening of demand for forex by manufacturers, have </p><p>led to a temporary appreciation of the naira that is </p><p>unlikely to be sustained for the reasons mentioned </p><p>above. Should reserves fall much below that floor, the </p><p>government will have no choice but to look for other </p><p>adjustment mechanisms in 2003.  These might comprise </p><p>extensive import bans and tightening of foreign </p><p>exchange regulations (which would again widen the </p><p>differential between the official and parallel </p><p>markets). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prospects for 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Salami suggested enigmatically that 2003 be called </p><p>the Year of Two Halves. He, like several other analysts </p><p>that we have talked to, expects that expansionary </p><p>fiscal policy will characterize the first half of 2003. </p><p>Salami thinks that a contractionary policy will follow </p><p>during the second half of the year to cure what Salami </p><p>calls fiscal hangover. Continuing deficit spending </p><p>during the first half of the year, coupled with general </p><p>uncertainty and capital flight, will maintain pressure </p><p>on the exchange rate. As the naira depreciates during </p><p>this time, Nigeria\'s heavy dependence on imports will </p><p>induce a rise in inflation. This will cause continued </p><p>erosion of asset prices, and savings will fall as a </p><p>percentage of GDP. Given the relatively low level of </p><p>foreign exchange, the Central Bank will be compelled to </p><p>mop up excess liquidity and the attendant effect will </p><p>be higher interest rates, if the rise is not suppressed </p><p>by administrative fiat. In the light of these </p><p>prospects, investors will be wary about imperiling </p><p>dollar resources for naira; consequently, domestic and </p><p>foreign investment in the non-oil sector in 2003 will </p><p>be low relative to 2000-2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  A few positive aspects may nevertheless emerge in </p><p>2003.  The willingness of banks to devote 10 percent of </p><p>their profits before tax to equity investments may </p><p>boost investment in the real sector in 2003.  In 2002 </p><p>little was done with this pool of investible funds, </p><p>which is building up, but creative initiatives by some </p><p>banks and venture capital companies may lead to </p><p>investments that will create employment.  Additional </p><p>jobs are likely to be created in 2003 by the next phase </p><p>of the deregulation of the telecommunications sector as </p><p>the second national carrier, Globalcom Ltd., begins to </p><p>deploy facilities early in 2003. </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. One key issue highlighted by the reports given us </p><p>is the paucity and unreliability of data.  This is </p><p>dramatized by the discrepancy between the projected </p><p>growth rate for 2002 by the IMF (-0.9%) and the Central </p><p>Bank of Nigeria (3.2%).  While there is little the </p><p>analyst can do about the poor data, it is important to </p><p>footnote this defect and add the necessary caveats to </p><p>the robustness of the analysis. While the central </p><p>message of a possible cloudy outcome is right on the </p><p>mark, analytical focus on the fiscal and fiscal policy </p><p>stance and foreign account suggests that Nigeria\'s </p><p>economic outcome is almost solely the result of policy. </p><p>A rigorous decomposition of the structure of the </p><p>economy shows, however, that the oil and agricultural </p><p>sectors account for about 60 percent of the GDP, and </p><p>performance in both sectors is not driven essentially </p><p>by monetary and fiscal policies.  Performance in the </p><p>oil sector is primarily driven by OPEC and </p><p>international oil prices, while agriculture is still </p><p>largely weather dependent (recall the basis for the IMF- </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria huge discrepancy on 2002 growth </p><p>rate).  Much of Salami\'s and Utomi\'s analysis focuses </p><p>on the formal (largely manufacturing) sector, but </p><p>manufacturing account for barely 5 percent of GDP. </p><p>This is this kind of structural analysis that leads us </p><p>to put the appropriate caveats to the gloomy forecast; </p><p>it is possible for economic performance to </p><p>significantly improve even without any improvement in </p><p>policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  Nevertheless, Salami\'s and Utomi\'s presentation of </p><p>late November echoed warnings we have heard from other </p><p>experts about the continuing structural imbalances </p><p>within the economy. Government deficits accommodated by </p><p>monetary policy perpetuate these imbalances. These will </p><p>become even more apparent should oil revenues fall. </p><p>Many countries engage in deficit spending to stimulate </p><p>growth; in Nigeria, however, public spending is largely </p><p>ineffective at increasing sustainable development. The </p><p>reason is that so little of those public funds are </p><p>channeled into productive investment.  Moreover, </p><p>government spending disproportionately favors the </p><p>richest four-percent of the population identified </p><p>earlier. These people tend to travel abroad and account </p><p>for a disproportionate share of imports. These factors </p><p>will put additional pressure on the naira.  Since the </p><p>rich generally seek to convert naira into foreign </p><p>exchange quickly when they have large volumes of </p><p>Nigerian currency (as many did so recently during the </p><p>political party conventions), to reduce exchange rate </p><p>risk and because forex is less bulky, the naira will </p><p>surely depreciate during the coming months. </p><p>Conversely, interest rates will remain high to attract </p><p>capital inflows.  So it is to be feared that instead of </p><p>stimulating growth, excessive government spending will </p><p>crowd out the private sector, which will force </p><p>companies to scramble for funds at high interest rates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  High interest rates will affect not only the </p><p>private sector.  The cost of government borrowing will </p><p>also remain high.  Consequently, investment in </p><p>infrastructure (roads, education, and public health) </p><p>which has been badly neglected during the last several </p><p>years may continue to be so.  An Emboff who has </p><p>accumulated eight years in Nigeria believes that its </p><p>infrastructure is generally decaying.  What is certain </p><p>is that new investment is insufficient to cover the </p><p>needs generated by population growth and depreciation </p><p>of existing assets.  To redress this situation, fiscal </p><p>policy as it has been implemented throughout the last </p><p>ten years must change. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. Improving fiscal policy would call for public </p><p>service reform and a budgetary process based on a </p><p>better appreciation of economic principles. We have </p><p>often heard Nigerian economists criticize their </p><p>government\'s budget formulators for establishing </p><p>budgets premised on one scenario and usually based upon </p><p>a single oil price. Many of these economists recommend </p><p>that budgets be based on multiple scenarios with </p><p>clearly defined trigger points.  For our part, we think </p><p>that the GON should encourage the Central Bank to issue </p><p>a directive to banks informing them that any and all </p><p>future lending to states and local governments would be </p><p>at their risk.  The federal government would thus offer </p><p>no guarantee and would refuse to "deduct at source" </p><p>(i.e., before disbursements from the Federation </p><p>Account) any payments on such debt.  The Central Bank </p><p>could also issue a "caveat emptor" notice to </p><p>international banks to discourage lending to states. </p><p>While such actions by the Central Bank would annoy some </p><p>state-level politicians, there would be little they </p><p>might do about it.  (Few local governments are in a </p><p>position to borrow.)  Assuming such actions led to a </p><p>modification of Nigeria\'s budgetary practices, it would </p><p>not only reduce uncertainty; it would also reassure </p><p>observers that while they may not see improvement in </p><p>the next quarter or two, subsequent quarters might hold </p><p>promise of a brighter future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
