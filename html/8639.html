BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On June 10 in separate conversations with Charge and </p><p>Ambassador Joyce Leader, Office Director of PRM/ANE, the </p><p>Secretaries of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Home </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>have attempted to assure us that Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>policy toward Tibetan refugees transiting Nepal has not </p><p>changed.  The absence of any written policy and variations in </p><p>the messages conveyed by the two Secretaries, however, make </p><p>it difficult to assume a uniform GON approach to such cases </p><p>in the future.  UNHCR\'s success in securing exit permits for </p><p>40 Tibetan refugees on June 11 may provide a promising early </p><p>indicator.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>MFA:  "INFORMAL INSTRUCTIONS" </p><p>NOT TO ARREST TIBETANS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In a June 10 meeting, Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman </p><p>Acharya told Charge that the Government of Nepal (GON) has </p><p>issued "informal instructions" to the police not to arrest </p><p>Tibetans transiting Nepal on their way to India.  (Note: </p><p>Acharya had earlier told Charge that he had spent four hours </p><p>at the Home Ministry the previous week reviewing procedures </p><p>and policies regarding Tibetan refugees.  End note.)  Acharya </p><p>described the May 31 deportation of 18 Tibetan refugees to </p><p>China (Reftel) as "an extraordinary circumstance" that will </p><p>not recur.  He asked the Charge how the GON could </p><p>re-establish its credibility with the international </p><p>community.  The Charge replied that the best way is for the </p><p>GON to revert to its past practice of complying with the </p><p>"gentlemen\'s agreement" by handing over Tibetan asylum </p><p>seekers to UNHCR.  The international community, including the </p><p>US, will be watching carefully to ensure that the GON </p><p>demonstrates its statement that it has not changed its policy </p><p>by continuing to abide by that agreement.  Acharya reiterated </p><p>his previous reassurances that the GON policy remains </p><p>unchanged. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Acharya once again blamed heavy Chinese pressure for </p><p>the GON deviating from its usual practice and deporting the </p><p>Tibetans.  As an example, he cited a request from the Chinese </p><p>government that Nepal issue multiple-entry visas to certain </p><p>"refugees" (i.e., Chinese spies posing as guides escorting </p><p>fleeing Tibetans across the border).  When the GON refused, </p><p>China imposed a work permit requirement for Nepalis seeking </p><p>employment in Hong Kong, Acharya said.  He added that the </p><p>Chinese government had earlier given the GON a list of names </p><p>of Tibetans it believed were in Nepal, requesting that the </p><p>GON apprehend them.  Instead, the GON ignored the list and </p><p>allowed three of the people listed to leave for India. </p><p>Acharya said he believes the Chinese hard line on the latest </p><p>group of 18 may have been in retaliation for the GON\'s </p><p>failure to heed that request. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>HOME MINISTRY: </p><p>FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Also on June 10, Ambassador Joyce Leader, Office </p><p>Director of PRM/ANE, accompanied by poloffs, met with Home </p><p>Secretary Tika Datta Niraula.  (Note:  Amb. Leader\'s call </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>marks the first time the Embassy has succeeded in speaking </p><p>with Niraula, despite numerous efforts, since May 29.  End </p><p>note.)  Amb. Leader underscored USG concern at the GON\'s </p><p>deportation of the 18 Tibetans and strongly urged the GON to </p><p>abide, on humanitarian grounds, by the "gentlemen\'s </p><p>agreement" and turn over Tibetan asylum seekers to UNHCR. </p><p>Niraula responded that the GON has not changed its policy and </p><p>described the deportation as an "accident" that "won\'t happen </p><p>again."  As an example of its commitment, the GON is prepared </p><p>to grant an exit permit to a Tibetan man who has been </p><p>detained since May, Niraula stated, pulling a file from his </p><p>desk.  When poloff asked when the exit permit would be </p><p>granted, Niraula replied that the final decision would have </p><p>to await appointment of a new Home Minister.  Poloffs also </p><p>noted that UNHCR had applied for exit permits for a group of </p><p>40 Tibetans, currently staying at the Reception Center, for </p><p>travel to India.  Niraula said he was unaware of the request </p><p>but foresaw no problem.  (Note:  The exit permits were </p><p>granted on June 11.  The bus was expected to leave the </p><p>evening of the same day.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Niraula contended that the GON broke no law by </p><p>detaining undocumented foreigners on its territory.  Even if </p><p>the GON did not break its laws, Amb. Leader rejoined, it </p><p>violated the gentlemen\'s agreement and the policy that had </p><p>earned it a reputation for tolerance and hospitality toward </p><p>Tibetans.  It is very important that the GON follow up its </p><p>verbal commitments with actions that demonstrate that its </p><p>policy remains intact. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Poloff asked Niraula to articulate GON policy toward </p><p>Tibetan asylum seekers.  Niraula replied that the GON will </p><p>hand over asylum seekers to the UNHCR if it expresses an </p><p>interest in them as "persons of concern."  The asylum seekers </p><p>may not be turned over, however, if the Chinese government </p><p>expresses an interest before the UNHCR in a particular case, </p><p>he suggested.  The Chinese had designated the 18 deported </p><p>Tibetans as "persons of concern" before the UNHCR did, he </p><p>asserted, claiming that the UNHCR did not contact the Home </p><p>Ministry until the day before the deportation.  (Note:  UNHCR </p><p>has told us it contacted the Home Ministry more than one week </p><p>before the deportation.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Poloff urged that UNHCR be afforded access to all </p><p>"persons of concern"--regardless of who else may have </p><p>expressed "concern" about them--in accordance with </p><p>international norms and standards.  When Niraula raised </p><p>Nepal\'s special relationship with China, Amb. Leader urged </p><p>the GON to keep the humanitarian issue of asylum divorced </p><p>from political considerations.  Niraula then backpedaled a </p><p>little from his previous statement about early Chinese </p><p>expressions of "concern" trumping UNHCR access, reiterating </p><p>that the deportations will not recur and that the GON has not </p><p>changed its policy. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The GON is acutely aware of the damage the </p><p>deportations have brought to its standing in the </p><p>international community and is particularly anxious to allay </p><p>donor concerns about possible recurrences in the future. </p><p>While we are pleased to hear of the "informal instructions" </p><p>given to the police not to arrest Tibetans, it is difficult </p><p>to determine, in the continued absence of a formal policy, </p><p>how closely the instructions will be followed--especially in </p><p>cases of "concern" to the Chinese.  We will continue to </p><p>monitor the situation closely--including the timely granting </p><p>of an exit permit to the Tibetan male Niraula mentioned. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Amb. Leader did not have an opportunity to clear </p><p>this message </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
