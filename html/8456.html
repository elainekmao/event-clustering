Sabah: As the peshmergain Northern Iraq </p><p>increased the dinar\'s rate of exchange against </p><p>the USD arbitrarily, truckers carrying goods from </p><p>Turkey to Iraq went on a strike for three days. </p><p>The truckers started carrying goods to Iraq again </p><p>only after the authorities resolved the issue. </p><p>The ROE was 20 Iraqi dinars to USD 1.00 until a </p><p>week ago, but because of a vacuum of authority, </p><p>the peshmerga charged 3.50 Iraqi dinars to USD </p><p>1.00. As a result of the arbitrary application, </p><p>the Iraqis increased the transit fee to 120 US </p><p>dollars. After the truckers\' strike, the transit </p><p>fee was dropped to 20 US dollars. Sirnak Deputy </p><p>Governor Resul Celik said only Turkish truckers </p><p>passing from Habur border gate were exposed to </p><p>such an application which aimed to make the trade </p><p>from Turkey difficult. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
