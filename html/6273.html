Erdogan declined to give a specific date </p><p>for a parliamentary discussion of the decree, saying that </p><p>the motion was of significance for the political future of </p><p>the AKP.  He voiced Turks\' concern about remarks of U/S of </p><p>State Grossman warning Ankara to avoid unilateral </p><p>intervention in northern Iraq.  Erdogan also complained that </p><p>the Turkomen have been left out of the Iraqi opposition </p><p>council.  He stressed that leaving northern Iraq\'s </p><p>administration to a KDP-PUK coalition was unacceptable for </p><p>Turkey.  Dailies claim that Ankara has given the U.S. </p><p>permission to set up nine bases for logistics and </p><p>maintenance within the framework of the deal on </p><p>modernization of Turkish bases that was approved by the </p><p>parliament last month.  American personnel will be subject </p><p>to Turkish law and will carry ID cards approved by Turkish </p><p>commanders when they leave the bases.  Americans will be </p><p>allowed to carry light weaponry for security and protection </p><p>of their equipment, according to the papers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: UN Secretary General Annan has offered a new </p><p>timetable to Cypriot leaders Papadopoulos and Denktas during </p><p>their meeting yesterday at The Hague.  According to the new </p><p>calendar, negotiations would continue until March 28, and </p><p>Greece, Turkey and UK will have to compromise on the UN plan </p><p>by March 31.  A referendum would then be held on both sides </p><p>of the island on April 6.  Meanwhile, Erdogan\'s criticism of </p><p>Annan for allegedly `deceiving\'Ankara rocked The Hague, </p><p>especially the Greeks and Greek Cypriots.  Erdogan has said </p><p>that the UN should not expect concessions only from the </p><p>Turkish side, and noted that there was no change in the </p><p>third plan regarding the sovereignty rights of Turkish </p><p>Cypriots.  Meanwhile, opposition parties in the Turkish </p><p>Cypriot sector have announced plans to organize a referendum </p><p>on the Annan plan on March 30. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq/US-Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> "The clash of two calendars" </p><p>Sami Kohen notes the nuances between Turkish and American </p><p>agenda priorities in the mass appeal Milliyet (3/11): "The </p><p>special election in Siirt province has paved the way for </p><p>Erdogan\'s premiership.  The reason for the huge </p><p>international press interest is simply because of the two </p><p>urgent and pending issues -- Iraq and Cyprus.  The world is </p><p>anxious to see the policies that the new AKP government will </p><p>pursue. . The general observation about the Iraq policy can </p><p>be summarized as follows: The Erdogan government will </p><p>present a second resolution to the parliament, but it will </p><p>not hurry.  Ankara likely will wait for a second UNSC </p><p>resolution, which is due by March 17.  According to a story </p><p>in the Washington Post, Turkey\'s final decision will be made </p><p>on March 19.  Yet it remains unclear whether the Bush </p><p>administration will be patient enough to wait until that </p><p>date.  There is a contradiction between Turkey\'s calendar </p><p>and the US\'s hurry.  A similar contradiction is also valid </p><p>on the Cyprus issue." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"End of story" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in the Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(3/11): "This is the most critical week which will shape the </p><p>future of the Iraq issue.  Washington imposed a deadline of </p><p>March 17 to Iraq, and is exerting pressure on Ankara to </p><p>bring a second authorization to the parliament before that </p><p>date.  However, the war-mongering lobby in Washington is not </p><p>as strong as it used to be.  First of all, the Turkish </p><p>parliament did not take Washington\'s bluff seriously. </p><p>Evidently, Washington did not have a `plan B.\' . Moreover, </p><p>the war-mongering lobby has received another serious blow. </p><p>Father Bush, according to a story in the British `The </p><p>Times,\' advised President Bush `not to act unilaterally and </p><p>try to make things up with the European countries.\' . In the </p><p>meantime, what we see is not only President Bush and the war- </p><p>mongerers are facing problems, but also British PM Blair\'s </p><p>political career is at stake.  It looks as if we are close </p><p>to the end of the story, as long as Turkey continues to </p><p>resist." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
