ENVOY JAMES MORRIS ON THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: On January 24, Ambassador Sullivan and key </p><p>Mission staff attended a meeting and lunch with Special </p><p>U.N. Envoy James Morris and members of his delegation </p><p>during his recent visit to Zimbabwe.  At these events, </p><p>Morris provided briefings on the current international, </p><p>regional and country-specific humanitarian situation, </p><p>current U.N. plans and priorities for responding to the </p><p>crisis, and the results of his discussions (to that point </p><p>in time) with top-level Government of Zimbabwe decision- </p><p>makers, including President Mugabe.  Although little </p><p>substantive progress was noted on the many critical issues </p><p>affecting the country\'s complex, interwoven crises, Morris\' </p><p>visit provided the opportunity for an updated assessment of </p><p>the situation and possible revised priorities and options </p><p>for a more effective future international response.  While </p><p>overall country prospects appear negative, Morris noted </p><p>some positive movement since his last visit in several </p><p>important areas.  However, desires to shift from short-term </p><p>relief response to longer-term mitigation/recovery </p><p>activities are obstructed by the continuing adverse GOZ </p><p>policy environment.  Without significant political change, </p><p>the prospects appear dim for an effective transition to </p><p>recovery in Zimbabwe.  Hence, given the negative near-term </p><p>predictions, we are expecting a prolonged relief response </p><p>with associated USG resource requirements, at the very </p><p>least similar to last year\'s levels.  Despite this rather </p><p>gloomy outlook, Morris (and WFP) continue to impress us </p><p>with their performance.  The Mission recommends continuing </p><p>USG support for on-going humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe, </p><p>as FY2003 resources permit.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. On January 24, Ambassador Sullivan, USAID Director </p><p>Weisenfeld and Aidoff attended a U.N. meeting with Special </p><p>U.N. Envoy (SE) for the Southern African Humanitarian </p><p>Crisis (and Executive Director of the World Food Program </p><p>(WFP), James Morris.  The meeting was well attended by high- </p><p>level representatives of most OECD country missions to </p><p>Zimbabwe, as well as the principal representatives of most </p><p>U.N. agencies in Zimbabwe.  Morris was accompanied on the </p><p>visit by a large team of U.N. officials representing </p><p>relevant U.N. agencies, including the Special U.N. Envoy </p><p>for HIV/AIDS Stephen Lewis, Associate </p><p>Administrator/Director of Bureau for Crisis Prevention and </p><p>Response UNDP, Julia Taft, and WFP\'s Southern Africa Crisis </p><p>Coordinator, Judith Lewis.  Immediately following the </p><p>meeting, Ambassador Sullivan hosted a lunch for selected </p><p>members of the delegation, including Morris, Taft and J. </p><p>Lewis, as well as the U.N. Humanitarian Co-ordinator for </p><p>Zimbabwe (HC) J. Victor Angelo and the WFP Country </p><p>Representative Kevin Farrell. Selected Mission staff also </p><p>attended. </p><p> </p><p>3. The stated purpose of the visit (part of a six-country </p><p>tour) was to follow up on the results of SE Morris\'s first </p><p>mission to Zimbabwe in September 2002, focusing especially </p><p>on: 1) the additional challenges to the humanitarian </p><p>paradigm imposed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, 2) an enhanced </p><p>role for women in the humanitarian response, and 3) </p><p>recommended "structural changes" in the humanitarian </p><p>response to accommodate the revised country (and regional) </p><p>scenario since his last visit and provide the </p><p>"comprehensive" international response to the regional </p><p>crisis called for by U.N. Secretary-General Annan.  This </p><p>latter point was the rationale for the large, multi- </p><p>sectoral composition of the accompanying delegation.  Note: </p><p>The meeting started slightly later than scheduled as the </p><p>delegation was delayed in finishing an "unscheduled" </p><p>meeting with President Mugabe and relevant Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe (GOZ) ministers and officials immediately prior to </p><p>this event.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>4. Morris began the meeting by noting the extremely </p><p>challenging humanitarian situation the world faced, </p><p>particularly in Africa, with the significant </p><p>additional/competing emergency relief requirements imposed </p><p>by the Horn region.  Note:  Morris had just visited </p><p>Ethiopia prior to coming to southern Africa.  End Note.  He </p><p>then thanked all countries present for their generous food </p><p>donations to date, stating that the WFP was handling more </p><p>food now than at any time in its history (over US$1 billion </p><p>worth in 2002).  For southern Africa, he noted that WFP\'s </p><p>regional and Zimbabwe country appeals were about 60 and 66 </p><p>percent met, respectively.  As a result, Zimbabwe\'s food </p><p>pipeline looked relatively healthy now (in contrast to last </p><p>month), with continuing incremental improvements in </p><p>coverage expected through March 2003 (i.e., the end of the </p><p>current WFP Emergency Operation (EMOP) period).  However, </p><p>given the serious problems with the current agricultural </p><p>season (as well as other extenuating factors, such as GOZ </p><p>mismanagement, the adverse effects of the fast-track land </p><p>fiasco and HIV/AIDS), he emphasized the continuing urgency </p><p>of the situation, indicating a requirement of an additional </p><p>100,000 MT of food for the Zimbabwe EMOP to cover a planned </p><p>three-month extension of the appeal period to June 2003. </p><p>Note:  With the delays experienced to date in the start-up </p><p>of this program as well as the temporary drop in aid </p><p>requirements anticipated following the April harvest, this </p><p>additional/extended target can readily be met within the </p><p>existing WFP food appeal, if its requested amounts are </p><p>provided in full.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>5. Following these introductory comments, the focus of </p><p>Morris\' briefing was on the results of his earlier meetings </p><p>with Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) officials, including GOZ </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Mudenge and the meeting with </p><p>President Mugabe.  Note: HC Angelo also noted that the </p><p>delegation had several additional, more specific meetings </p><p>scheduled during the ensuing course the visit with a wide </p><p>variety of GOZ ministers and officials.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>6. Morris described the Mugabe meeting as a general review </p><p>of progress in the response to the country\'s humanitarian </p><p>crisis since his last visit.  While no major breakthroughs </p><p>were reported (unlike the last visit - see reftel A), they </p><p>agreed that some "progress" had been achieved on some </p><p>issues.  Examples included NGO registration/approval for </p><p>WFP operations (from four organizations in September to 12 </p><p>now), importation of Genetically Modified (GM) food </p><p>products (accepted, with WFP milling - including local </p><p>milling - and labeling prior to distribution), and some </p><p>improvement in providing permits for food imports (although </p><p>problems remain in this area).  On the GM issue, Morris </p><p>noted, parenthetically, the extreme importance of the </p><p>movement in this area, stating that, given the tremendous </p><p>importance of USG contributions (accounting for about half </p><p>of the total response worldwide), "they couldn\'t succeed if </p><p>all countries were like Zambia."  Although the discussions </p><p>touched on most of the now familiar issues (e.g., GOZ Grain </p><p>Marketing Board (GMB) monopoly/private sector </p><p>participation, price controls on basic commodities, foreign </p><p>exchange shortages/controls, political </p><p>interference/manipulation of food aid, the plight of the ex- </p><p>commercial farm workers, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its </p><p>relationship to the food crisis, etc.), Morris reported </p><p>little evidence of significant GOZ movement in most of </p><p>these areas.  The possible exception was Mugabe\'s apparent </p><p>support for a possible wheat monetization program for urban </p><p>areas, which are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to </p><p>the persistent market shortages and spiraling black market </p><p>prices.  While there appeared to be some recognition of the </p><p>increasing severity of the humanitarian situation in </p><p>country, generally, Morris indicated his impression that </p><p>government appeared to have a "different view" of the </p><p>situation, with "grandiose predictions" of agricultural </p><p>production alleviating the crisis through such dubious </p><p>schemes as expanded irrigated winter maize production </p><p>(which failed dismally last year, as most experts had </p><p>predicted). </p><p> </p><p>7. Following Morris\' presentation, SE S. Lewis briefly </p><p>highlighted the tremendous additional problems the HIV/AIDS </p><p>pandemic imposed on the crisis, with its significant </p><p>additional burdens on individual sufferers (nutritional </p><p>impacts), community coping structures (the increasing </p><p>numbers of elderly and especially orphan-headed </p><p>households), already-depleted health delivery systems, and </p><p>prospects for agricultural/economic recovery (labor </p><p>shortages).  AA Taft then echoed these sentiments, </p><p>suggesting a greater focus on women (as primary family care </p><p>givers and food producers/providers), and the possibility </p><p>of capacity-building initiatives to mitigate the effects of </p><p>the serious "brain drain" of skilled heath sector </p><p>personnel.  Notable on this subject was Foreign Minister </p><p>Mudenge\'s comment in an earlier meeting with the delegation </p><p>likening the alarming scope of the pandemic in Zimbabwe </p><p>(and, indeed, southern Africa) to a form of "genocide" (in </p><p>the rhetorical sense only, of course). </p><p> </p><p>8.  The briefing concluded with a statement of U.N. </p><p>priorities in future response efforts, including: </p><p>- the need to better integrate the effects of the HIV/AIDS </p><p>pandemic into country analysis and response activities; </p><p>- the need for greater support in the non-food areas of </p><p>assistance (health, nutrition, agricultural recovery, etc.) </p><p>for a truly comprehensive international response; and </p><p>- the need to begin to promote the transition from short- </p><p>term relief response to longer-term recovery/transition </p><p>initiatives to mitigate the crisis. </p><p> </p><p>9. While other subjects were touched on (the situation on </p><p>the ground, HIV/AIDS, urban monetization, agricultural </p><p>season prospects, etc.), the ensuing audience discussion </p><p>focused overwhelmingly on the relative merits of attempting </p><p>longer-term development solutions within the current </p><p>adverse GOZ policy environment.  While additional support </p><p>for short-term humanitarian relief activities seemed </p><p>inevitable, most donor country representatives present </p><p>expressed serious reservations about longer-term support in </p><p>the absence of significant reform of relevant government </p><p>policies (especially, but not exclusively, the land </p><p>problem).  Until significant political reform occurred, the </p><p>response was likely to be limited to short-term </p><p>humanitarian relief (recognizing the negative potential </p><p>effects this approach might have in prolonging the crisis </p><p>and the concomitant increased international response </p><p>requirements). </p><p> </p><p>10. The ensuing luncheon discussion at Ambassador </p><p>Sullivan\'s residence repeated these same themes, with a </p><p>greater focus on HIV/AIDS and possible innovative cross- </p><p>sectoral initiatives that might be pursued within the </p><p>current country context.  Suggestions discussed here </p><p>included using WFP food relief operations to promote AIDS </p><p>awareness (through messages on bags, presentations/messages </p><p>at distribution sites, etc.) and providing Food-for-Health </p><p>Workers (to attempt to arrest the significant loss of </p><p>trained sector personnel). </p><p> </p><p>11. Comment:  As for his last visit, his schedule during </p><p>this visit clearly demonstrates that SE Morris continues to </p><p>enjoy excellent access to top-level GOZ decision-makers. </p><p>However, contrary to his last visit, it appears that these </p><p>interactions are yielding diminishing returns.  While more </p><p>significant movement on key GOZ policies was evident in </p><p>September, despite the increasingly dire nature of the </p><p>country situation, there appears to be reduced prospects </p><p>for substantive policy reform at this time (other than </p><p>"tinkering" with existing policies to reduce some of the </p><p>operational constraints to the response effort).  From the </p><p>donor response, it also seems evident that until such </p><p>substantive reform occurs, the prospects for a transition </p><p>from relief to longer-term recovery remain dim.  Hence, </p><p>given the negative prospects for the current agricultural </p><p>season, it would appear that the humanitarian crisis is set </p><p>to continue for some time to come (with the associated </p><p>additional USG relief requirements that this situation will </p><p>entail).  Within this pessimistic framework, the Mission </p><p>generally endorses Morris\' (and WFP) response efforts to </p><p>date (under extremely difficult circumstances), and </p><p>supports the continuation of USG assistance to the Zimbabwe </p><p>humanitarian response, as resources permit.  In this </p><p>regard, we would highlight the possibility for a renewed </p><p>look at urban monetization schemes in Zimbabwe in response </p><p>to the more encouraging inputs received on this subject </p><p>during this visit.
