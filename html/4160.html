<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002978 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/01/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KTIA, NI, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MOD DANJUMA QUESTIONS ARTICLE 98 </p><p>AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 157638 </p><p>(B) STATE 140390 </p><p>(C) STATE 135262 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During an October 25 meeting, Ambassador Jeter gave </p><p>a draft Article 98 agreement (REF. A) to Minister of </p><p>Defense Lieutenant General (ret.) Theophilus Y. Danjuma. </p><p>In delivering talking points on the ICC (REFS. B and C), </p><p>the Ambassador emphasized that Nigeria\'s active role in </p><p>peacekeeping missions could make its servicemen vulnerable </p><p>to politically motivated prosecutions.  Such would have </p><p>been the case, for example, regarding Nigeria\'s ECOWAS </p><p>troops in Sierra Leone.  It might, therefore, be in </p><p>Nigeria\'s interest to consider the merits of an Article 98 </p><p>Agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Danjuma said he was "intrigued" by European Union </p><p>member states\' objections to Article 98 agreements, noting </p><p>that many believe the U.S. would "kill the ICC the way it </p><p>killed the League of Nations".  Danjuma also wondered if </p><p>the ICC could implement its mandate if the international </p><p>community "starts to make exceptions".  Ambassador replied </p><p>that since Article 98 was part of the Rome Statute, the </p><p>contracting states have agreed that such exceptions would </p><p>not impair the ICC. Ambassador also mentioned that possible </p><p>Congressional action under the American Servicemembers\' </p><p>Protection Act could conceivably, in the future, have some </p><p>impact on security assistance relationships. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ambassador mentioned that he had also raised this </p><p>issue with National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed, and </p><p>also planned to raise it with the Attorney General at the </p><p>earliest opportunity.  Danjuma said he would discuss the </p><p>issue with Minister of Foreign Affairs Sule Lamido this </p><p>week. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
