(C) SUMMARY: IN A THREE HOUR MEETING NEARLY </p><p>HALF OF WHICH WAS SPENT ON LANO, PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>TOLD US THAT LANO ACQUISITION WAS AN OVERDUE </p><p>MATTER OF ACHIEVING JUSTICE AND ESCAPING FROM </p><p>UNOER THE YOKE OF COLONIALISM THAT THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE NOW OEMANO.  THE WAR VET\'S OCCUPATIONS, </p><p>WHICH HE SUPPORTS BUT OID NOT INITIATE, ARE A </p><p>DEMONSTRATION OF "PRACTICAL SELF-HELP."  WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT IN CONDONING THE VET\'S ACTIONS HE </p><p>HAS UNLEASHEO A FORCE THAT IS POWERFUL, </p><p>DANGEROUS, EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL AND A </p><p>THREAT TO THE PRESIDENT\'S IRON GRIP.  ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>GUERILLAS ARE OPERATING AGAIN IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p>HAVING UNCHAINED SUCH A FORCE, HE NOW NEEDS TO </p><p>BUY IT OFF, MOST LIKELY WITH LAND HAVING ALREADY </p><p>EXERCISED THE CASH OPTION, IF HE IS TO MAINTAIN </p><p>CONTROL OVER THE REINS OF POWER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE PRESIDENT IS ADAMANT THAT BRITAIN </p><p>MUST PAY FOR LAND ACQUISITION AS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>HIM, THEY COMMITTED TO IT AT LANCASTER HOUSE IN </p><p>1980.  IF THEY DO NOT PROVIDE FUNDS, COMPULSORY </p><p>ACQUISITION WITHOUT COMPENSATION WILL GO AHEAD. </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS, WHO RETAIN THE MENTALITY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02205  01 OF 04  241249Z </p><p>OF BRITISH COLONIZERS ACCOROING TO PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE, HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY NEED TO OFFER UP </p><p>AS A GOOD FAITH GESTURE ALL 841 FARMS PREVIOUSLY </p><p>DESIGNATED BY THE GOZ FOR ACQUISITION.  NEITHER </p><p>THE POLICE NOR MILTTARY WILL BE USED TO EVICT THE </p><p>FARM INVADERS, ACCOROING TO MUGABE, AS THEY ARE </p><p>MERELY "FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE WAITED TOO LONG </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DURING THE EVENING OF APRIL 22 PRESIDENT </p><p>ROBERT MUGABE, UNACCOMPANIED BUT FOR A NOTETAKER, </p><p>SPENT THREE HOURS PLUS DISCUSSING THE PRIOR DAYS </p><p>MINI-SUMMIT OF REGIONAL LEADERS AT VICTORIA </p><p>FALLS, THE CONGO PEACE PROCESS AND ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>LAND ISSUE WITH U.S. OFFICIALS.  THE U.S. GROUP </p><p>CONSISTED OF S/E HOWARD WOLPE, AMBASSADOR </p><p>MCDONALD, LT. COL. GADDIS, SPECIAL ADVISOR </p><p>PRENDERGAST AND ECONOFF NOTETAKER.  AFTER THE </p><p>INITIAL 20 MINUTES SPENT DESCRIBING THE VICTORIA </p><p>FALLS GATHERING AND PROGRESS MADE THERE ON THE </p><p>CONGO ISSUE MUGABE, WITHOUT A PROMPT FROM US, </p><p>LAUNCHED INTO A 45-MINUTE HISTORICAL TOUR OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S LAND ISSUE COVERING THE PRE-RHODES\' </p><p>DAYS TO THE PRESENT.  DETAILED AND FULL OF </p><p>MINUTIA (THE PRESIDENT WAS A SCHOOLTEACHER FOR </p><p>YEARS BEFORE AND DURING THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE), </p><p>THE MESSAGE WAS THAT HISTORY SAW THE LAND STOLEN </p><p>FROM THE BLACKS WITH CONTROL CONSOLIDATED BY THE </p><p>BRITISH WITH VICIOUS DISREGARD FOR THE RIGHTS OF </p><p>BLACKS, A STATE THAT CONTINUES TODAY WITH ACTIVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02205  01 OF 04  241249Z </p><p>BRITISH SPONSORSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>BRITAIN TO BLAME </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) DURING THE LANCASTER HOUSE NEGOTIATIONS A </p><p>WEEK WAS SPENT STUCK ON THE LAND COMPENSATION </p><p>ISSUE.  PRESIDENT CARTER HELPED BREAK THE </p><p>DEADLOCK, AND THE RESULT WAS A 10-YEAR PERIOD </p><p>WHEN THE PROSCRIBED RULE OF WILLING SELLER- </p><p>WILLING BUYER WAS IN EFFECT, WITH BRITAIN </p><p>SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING FOR THE LAND.  THE PROBLEM </p><p>IS THE ENGLISH NEVER HONORED THEIR OBLIGATIONS, </p><p>MUGABE TOLD US: THE THATCHER GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>LUKEWARM; JOHN MAJOR\'S ADMINISTRATION WAS COLD; </p><p>AND BLAIR\'S LABOR LEADERSHIP OUTRIGHT ICY.  THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT LAMENTED TO US THAT THE </p><p>BRITISH PRIME MINISTER BLAIR HAD NEVER SPENT </p><p>QUALITY ONE-ON-ONE TIME WITH HIM (HAVING STIFFED </p><p>MUGABE ON AN OFFICIAL VISIT AFTER INVITING HIM), </p><p>AND COULD ONLY SPARE THE SENIOR AFRICAN STATESMAN </p><p>10-15 MINUTES ONCE ON A PRODUCTION LINE BASIS </p><p>DURING A EUROPE/AFRICA SUMMIT.  "I HAVE SPENT </p><p>MORE TIME WITH CLINTON" HE SNIFFED, "AND HAVE </p><p> </p><p>EVEN MET WITH CHIRAC FOUR TIMES -- THOUGH HIS </p><p>TIME IN OFFICE IS LESS THAN BLAIR\'S."

"THIS IS WHAT WE ARE NOW </p><p>CARRYING OUT," HE TOLD US, "WITH THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT I SIGNED LAST WEEK." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ZIMBABWE HAS NO MONEY TO PAY FOR LAND, </p><p>MUGABE TOLD US.  BRITAIN DOES HAVE THE MONEY, AND </p><p>IS REQUIRED TO PAY BY BOTH ITS PROMISE TO, AND </p><p>THE FACT THAT ITS CITIZENS STOLE THE LAND FROM </p><p>AFRICANS.  THE LAND ACQUISITION CLAUSE WAS PLACED </p><p>IN THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION TO ENABLE THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS "TO GET PAID SOMETHING FOR </p><p>THEIR LAND", HE EXPLAINED.  (COMMENT:  THIS IS </p><p>THE LINE MUGABE TOOK LAST WEEK IN HIS MEETING THE </p><p>CFU, WHERE HE LECTURED THEM THAT THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE WAS IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS </p><p>AND REMONSTRATING THEM FOR FIGHTING SO ACTIVELY </p><p>AGAINST IT.  END COMMENT.)  THE CONSTITUTION WAS </p><p>REJECTED BECAUSE THE FARMERS ORGANIZED THEIR </p><p>LABOR TO VOTE NO, IN EFFECT CONSPIRING AGAINST </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT, HE TOLD US, AND BECAUSE THE PARTY </p><p>DID NOT CAMPAIGN ENOUGH FOR IT.  THE WAR VETS </p><p>REACTED TO THE REFERENDUM VOTE BY SPRINGING INTO </p><p>ACTION IN A "SELF-HELP MODE", MUGABE STATED, "AND </p><p>WE WANTED IT TO BE A DEMONSTRATION MARK ON THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02205  02 OF 04  241249Z </p><p>MINDS OF THE FARMER\'S AND THE BRITS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) "THE WAR VETS ARE PROTESTORS," HE </p><p>CONTINUED "AND WHILE THE BRITS VIEW IT AS A </p><p>VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW I WILL NEVER SEND IN </p><p>THE ARMY AND POLICE AGAINST OUR OWN PEOPLE."  "IT </p><p>WOULD CAUSE MORE BLOODSHED AND REMEMBER THAT </p><p>THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF WAR VETERANS IN THE </p><p>ARMY, THOUGH FEWER IN THE POLICE," HE STATED </p><p>WHILE LOOKING AT US OVER HIS EYEGLASSES.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT ALSO REITERATED THE DILEMMA CONFRONTING </p><p>THE GOZ WERE IT TO TRY TO ENFORCE THE COURT\'S </p><p>ORDER TO EVICT THE INVADERS.  HIS ARGUMENTS WERE </p><p>THE SAME AS THOSE LAID OUT BY HIS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER TO US EARLIER IN THE DAY (IN ESSENCE THE </p><p>POLICE\'S LACK OF CAPACITY TO ACT AND THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE NON-INTERFERENCE RULING, SEE REF A). </p><p> </p><p>WE PUSH BACK </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WHEN AMBASSADOR MCDONALD RAISED A NUMBER </p><p>OF POINTS REGARDING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING </p><p>THE VIOLENCE OCCURRING ON THE FARMS, DISREGARD OF </p><p>THE RULE OF LAW, THE USG\'S COMMITMENT AND </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR LAND REFORM AND THE NEED FOR A </p><p>PRACTICAL SOLUTION, PRESIDENT MUGABE RESPONDED </p><p>WITH SOME OF HIS TRADEMARK EMOTION AND POINTED </p><p>RHETORIC.  SOME OF THE POINTS AND COUNTERPOINTS </p><p>ARE (U.S. AND ZIMBABWE RESPECTIVELY): </p><p> </p><p>   WE NEED TO RETURN TO THE PRINCIPALS OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02205  02 OF 04  241249Z </p><p>1998 LAND REFORM CONFERENCE.  RESPONSE: THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) OPPOSED THE 841 </p><p>DESIGNATED FARM LIST, AND WITH BRITAIN\'S HELP </p><p>STYMIED IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>    THE WORLD BANK AND OTHERS CAN FUND SOME LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION. RESPONSE: WE WILL NOT GO AHEAD ANY </p><p>MORE ON FAITH.  FOR 20 YEARS WE HAVE DONE THIS </p><p>AND THE LAND ISSUE WILL NOT BE SOLVED UNTIL </p><p>BRITAIN GIVES US THE MONEY TO BUY IT.  THE PEOPLE </p><p>WILL SETTLE FOR NOTHING LESS. </p><p> </p><p>   WE NEED A PRACTICAL SOLUTION.  THERE ARE 800 - </p><p>1000 FARMS BEING VOLUNTARILY OFFERED FOR SALE. </p><p>RESPONSE: THE WAR VETS HAVE ALREADY COME UP WITH </p><p>A PRACTICAL SOLUTION.  THEY ARE ON THE FARMS AND </p><p>WE HAVE A LAW THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MOVE AHEAD ON </p><p>ACQUIRING THE FARMS WE NEED. </p><p> </p><p>   WHAT OF THE DAMAGE TO ZIMBABWE\'S IMAGE AS A </p><p>WONDERFUL COUNTRY, NOT CHARACTERIZED BY VIOLENCE </p><p>OR STANDOFFS?  THE COUNTRY HAS SUFFERED A BLACK </p><p>EYE.  RESPONSE: ZIMBABWE HAS ONLY BEEN WONDERFUL </p><p>FOR THE WHITE COLONIZERS NOT THE BLACKS.  THAT </p><p>HAS NOT CHANGED FOR 20 YEARS SINCE INDEPENDENCE </p><p>BUT WILL NOW.  MORE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN SOUTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6082 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02205  03 OF 04  241250Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-01   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   L-00     AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /009W </p><p>                  ------------------4F3109  241253Z /38 </p><p>P 241252Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5829 </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 002205 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF A/S SUSAN RICE, OAS POWELL, AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/23/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EAGR, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: THE GUERILLA WAR FOR LAND IN ZIMABABWE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02205  03 OF 04  241250Z </p><p>CONTINUES </p><p> </p><p>AFRICA ON THE LAND ISSUE WITH A LOT LESS </p><p>PUBLICITY.  BRITAIN IS TO BLAME, WE ARE NO LONGER </p><p>THEIR COLONY.  BRITISH MP\'S ARE ABSENTEE OWNERS </p><p>OF FARMS, THEY SEEK TO PROTECT TOO.  FINALLY WE </p><p>HAVE THE BRITS ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>   WHAT OF THE 841 FARMS THAT YOU HAVE DEMANDED </p><p>FROM THE CFU?  WHAT OF THE PROPERTIES THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ALREADY OWNS THAT ARE NOT UTILIZED? </p><p>RESPONSE: THEY WILL SAY NO AT FIRST (THE CFU), </p><p>BUT ON THAT THEY MUST AGREE.  WE NEED THOSE 841 </p><p>FARMS BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION.  THEY ARE NEXT </p><p>TO THE COMMUNAL AREAS, THE ONES WE OWN ARE NOT. </p><p>IN WRITING WE HAVE ASSURED THE CFU THAT THE </p><p>DISPLACED COMMERCIAL FARMERS CAN BUY A </p><p>REPLACEMENT PROPERTY.  WE WILL NOT DEVIATE FROM </p><p>THE PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>    WHAT OF THE MONEY FOR LAND IN THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>BUDGET STILL UNSPENT?  RESPONSE: WE WILL NEVER </p><p>USE OUR MONEY FOR LAND - JUST DEVELOPMENT.  THE </p><p>BRITS WILL PAY OR THERE WILL BE NO PAYMENT. </p><p>THOSE TAKING ACTIONS AGAINST US TODAY HAVE NEVER </p><p>SUPPORTED US SINCE 1980, LIKE THE BRITS AND THE </p><p>WHITE FARMERS.  I AM CALLED HITLER IN THE BRITISH </p><p>PRESS.  THEY NEVER CALLED IAN SMITH A HITLER. </p><p>THEY DO THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KEEP US A </p><p>COLONY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02205  03 OF 04  241250Z </p><p> - WHAT ABOUT YOU MAKING A STATEMENT IN THE </p><p>SPIRIT OF VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA\'S -- TO WITHDRAW? </p><p>RESPONSE: I DID NOT SEE THAT STATEMENT AND HAVE </p><p>ONLY HEARD OF IT.  HE DENIES TO ME THAT HE MADE </p><p>IT. </p><p> </p><p>    WHAT ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE INVASION OF THE </p><p>ECONOMY?  THIS IS THE HARVEST SEASON FOR TOBACCO. </p><p>RESPONSE: THE TIME HAS COME AFTER 20 YEARS.  WE </p><p>WILL RESOLVE IT NOW.  IF THE CFU FARMERS WANT TO </p><p>LEAVE THEY SHOULD GO NOW.  THEY ARE EMBITTERED </p><p>OLD RHOADIES WHO HAVE NEVER REPENTED, SADDENED </p><p>THAT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR POWER SINCE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  THEY ARE SABOTAGING THE ECONOMY, </p><p>HAVING BEEN RAISED AND LIVED IN THE DAYS OF </p><p>DISHONESTY AS SANCTIONS BUSTERS.  THEY ARE THE </p><p>WEALTHIEST CLASS BUT PAY THE LEAST TAXES. </p><p> </p><p>   BUT WHAT OF THE MORAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST WHAT </p><p>IS OCCURRING?  YOU ARE THE HEAD OF STATE AND THE </p><p>MORAL LEADER OF THE COUNTRY.  IF YOU CAME OUT </p><p>STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE RULE OF LAW AND TOLD THE </p><p>WAR VETS TO LEAVE THE FARM, MOST WOULD. </p><p>RESPONSE: THE AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE IS EXAGGERATED </p><p>BY THE BBC AND CNN.  TWO DAYS AGO CNN STAGED AN </p><p>EVICTION OF THE WAR VETS.  BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE </p><p>THE MEDIA ON OUR SIDE DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE </p><p>NOT RIGHT OR JUST.  I WILL NOT SEND THE POLICE OR </p><p>ARMY AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02205  03 OF 04  241250Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MUGABE DISPLAYED LUCIDITY AND A </p><p>REMARKABLE MEMORY ANO RECALL THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>CONVERSATION.  HIS MOOO ANO EMOTION SWINGS </p><p>MATCHEO THE RHETORIC ANO WHEN WE RETURNEO TO </p><p>CONGO MATTERS AFTER THE LAND ISSUE HE WAS A </p><p>CHANGEO MAN.  AMBASSAOOR MCOONALO IN A TELEPHONE </p><p>CALL BEFORE THE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT AND </p><p>DURING THE LONG SESSION THOUGHT THE MOOD WAS </p><p>CORDIAL EVEN WHEN THE ISSUES GOT DIFFICULT.  WE </p><p>ARE THE ONLY WESTERN COUNTRY THAT MUGABE HAS MET </p><p>WITH ON THE TOPIC OF LAND.  WE BELIEVE WE WERE </p><p>HEARD, BUT MUGABE WAS NOT PERSUADED.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR PLANS TO CONTINUE HIS CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THE ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IT IS CLEAR THAT MUGABE IS STILL FIGHTING </p><p>THE GUERILLA STRUGGLE HE WON 20 YEARS AGO.  HE </p><p>HAS DRAWN A LINE IN THE SAND AND SAID, "LAND NOW </p><p>AT ALL COSTS."  THE PRESIDENT REALIZES HE IS IN A </p><p>FIGHT FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE, A BATTLE HE MUST </p><p>WIN.  UNLEASHING THE WAR VETS IS A DANGEROUS </p><p>TACTIC, REEKING OF DESPERATION.  THEY ARE A PIT </p><p>BULL LOOSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AND GETTING THEM </p><p>BACK IN THE CAGE OR ON A STOUT CHAIN WILL REQUIRE </p><p>OFFERINGS AND THE PROMISE OF REGULAR FEEDINGS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6086 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02205  04 OF 04  241250Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-01   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   L-00     AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /009W </p><p>                  ------------------4F311C  241253Z /38 </p><p>P 241252Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5830 </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 04 HARARE 002205 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF A/S SUSAN RICE, OAS POWELL, AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/23/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EAGR, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: THE GUERILLA WAR FOR LAND IN ZIMABABWE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02205  04 OF 04  241250Z </p><p>CONTINUES </p><p> </p><p>EVENTS IN THE 24 HOURS SINCE OUR MEETING SHOW </p><p>THAT THE MESSAGE OF NON-VIOLENCE ESPOUSED BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT IN HIS EARLIER MEETINGS WITH THE </p><p>FARMERS AND THE VETS HAVE NOT SUNK IN FOR THE </p><p>LATTER. </p><p> </p><p>10.
