<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BOGOTA 005460 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 6/18/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PTER, PGOV, PREL, PINS, MARR, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT/FARC BEGIN HUMANITARIAN </p><p>EXCHANGE/FARC MANIPULATES EVENT </p><p> </p><p>1. CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON. REASONS: </p><p>1.5(C,D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON JUNE 16, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FARC </p><p>BEGAN THE PLANNED EXCHANGE OF CAPTURED SOLDIERS AND </p><p>POLICEMEN FOR IMPRISONED FARC GUERRILLAS WITH THE FARC </p><p>RELEASE OF 29 POLICEMEN AND SOLDIERS AND THE GOC RELEASE </p><p>OF 11 FARC GUERRILLAS.  ON JUNE 17, THE FARC RELEASED AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL FOUR POLICEMEN IN A SEPARATE CEREMONY.  BY JUNE </p><p>18, A TOTAL OF 47 SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN HAD BEEN </p><p>RELEASED.  THE NEXT STEP IS FOR THE FARC TO UNILATERALLY </p><p>RELEASE SOME 100 ADDITIONAL POLICEMEN/SOLDIERS IN THE VERY </p><p>NEAR FUTURE.  MANY OF THE RELEASED POLICEMEN AND SOLDIERS </p><p>HAD BEEN HELD BY THE FARC SINCE THEIR CAPTURE DURING THE </p><p>DISASTROUS ARMY AND POLICE DEFEATS AT MIRAFLORES AND MITU </p><p>(1998) AND PUERTO RICO (1999). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE FARC RENEGED ON ITS WORD TO THE GOC THAT IT </p><p>WOULD KEEP THE EVENT AT A LOW PROFILE BY BRINGING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESS TO THE RELEASE OF THE </p><p>SOLDIERS/POLICEMEN AND CREATING A LARGE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MEDIA EVENT.  ARMED FORCES COMMANDER GEN. FERNANDO TAPIAS </p><p>CALLED THE FARC MEDIA DISPLAY A "SPECTACLE," AND ADDED </p><p>THAT THE FARC RELEASE IN NO WAY MADE UP FOR THE INHUMANE, </p><p>CONCENTRATION-CAMP TYPE CONDITIONS THE SOLDIERS/POLICEMEN </p><p>WERE HELD IN FOR YEARS.  ALTHOUGH MOST RELEASED </p><p>SOLDIERS/POLICEMEN RESERVED COMMENTS, ONE SOLDIER\'S </p><p>COMMENT THAT THE FARC "TREATED THEM LIKE ANIMALS" WAS </p><p>WIDELY DISSEMINATED BY THE LOCAL PRESS.  (NOTE: EMBASSY </p><p>SOURCES SAY THAT THE MILITARY HIERARCHY HAD INSISTED TO </p><p>THE GOC THAT THE EXCHANGES BE DONE VERY LOW KEY TO KEEP </p><p>THE FARC FROM GAINING POLITICAL MILEAGE FROM THE EVENT. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE GOC HAD APPARENTLY REACHED AGREEMENT WITH THE </p><p>FARC ON THIS ISSUE, THE FARC DID AN END-RUN ON THE GOC BY </p><p>BRINGING THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS TO COVER THE EVENT.  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SEPARATELY, OF THE 12 FARC GUERRILLAS WHO WERE DUE </p><p>FOR RELEASE ALSO ON JUNE 16, ONLY 11 WERE RELEASED WHEN </p><p>ONE OPTED TO COMPLETE HIS SENTENCE AND LEAVE THE FARC. </p><p>DESPITE WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT THIS GROUP WOULD </p><p>INCLUDE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT UPPER AND MID-LEVEL </p><p>FARC COMMANDERS IN COLOMBIA\'S JAILS, NONE OF THE RELEASED </p><p>BELONGED TO THE FARC POLITICAL OR MILITARY HIERARCHY, AND, </p><p>IN FACT, MOST WERE NO MORE THAN FOOT SOLDIERS OR LOW-LEVEL </p><p>URBAN MILITIAS.  HOWEVER, MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SOURCES </p><p>TOLD POLOFF ON JUNE 18 THAT THREE OR FOUR ADDITIONAL FARC </p><p>PRISONERS ARE DUE TO BE RELEASED SOON, AND THAT THIS GROUP </p><p>MAY CONTAIN SOME HIGHER RANKING FARC MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: PREDICTABLY, THE FARC USED THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE TO STAGE A MEDIA SHOW, PROBABLY TO </p><p>TRY TO REPAIR ITS BADLY-TARNISHED INTERNATIONAL IMAGE. </p><p>FOR ITS PART, THE GOC DESERVES CREDIT FOR HAVING FOUGHT </p><p>OFF FARC PRESSURE TO INCLUDE SOME OF THE FARC\'S IMPORTANT </p><p>CADRES AND MORE NOTORIOUS PERPETRATORS OF ACTS OF EXTREME </p><p>VIOLENCE AMONG THE RELEASED.  HOPEFULLY, GOC PEACE </p><p>COMMISSIONER CAMILO GOMEZ WILL REJECT ANY ATTEMPT BY THE </p><p>FARC TO INCLUDE SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAST </p><p>GROUP TO BE RELEASED.  ALTHOUGH MOST COLOMBIANS REJOICED </p><p>OVER THE RELEASE OF THE POLICEMEN/SOLDIERS, AND HOPED FOR </p><p>MORE RELEASES, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THIS ACT, IN AND OF </p><p>ITSELF, WILL RENEW GENERAL CONFIDENCE IN THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  THAT MAY ONLY COME IF THE FARC BEGINS SERIOUS </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS ON DOWNGRADING THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>COMMITS TO ABIDING BY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
