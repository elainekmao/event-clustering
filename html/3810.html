<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005528 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, NEA/ARN, EUR/EB, AND S/CT </p><p>DOJ FOR OIA: SWARTZ AND FRIEDMAN </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR LEGATT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, NL, NO, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ TO APPROACH DUTCH TO ASK THAT MULLAH KREKAR </p><p>NOT BE EXPELLED TO NORWAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. BERRY/RUSSELL TELCON 9/25/02 </p><p> </p><p>     B. THE HAGUE 2722 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 5398 </p><p>     D. OSLO 2169 </p><p>     E. THE HAGUE 2659 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>EXPELLING KREKAR TO NORWAY? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Following ref a telcon, DCM and PolCouns September </p><p>25 called on Acting Foreign Minister Shaher Bak and Personal </p><p>Assistant to Foreign Minister Muasher, Ali al-Ayed, regarding </p><p>the GOJ\'s request for the extradition of Najmuddin Faraj </p><p>Ahmad (aka Mullah Krekar) from Holland.  The DCM explained </p><p>that the Dutch said they were worried that, if Norway strips </p><p>Krekar of his refugee status and the 3-judge panel in the </p><p>October 9 extradition hearing denies Jordan\'s extradition </p><p>request, the GONL will be forced to release Krekar -- an </p><p>outcome the Dutch (and Jordanians) definitely do not want. </p><p>Consequently, we understand that the GONL may attempt to </p><p>expel Krekar to Norway before his refugee status/travel </p><p>documents are revoked. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Bak said that he would call the Dutch Ambassador in </p><p>Amman and urge the GONL to continue with the process of </p><p>extradition to Jordan (including the October 9 hearing), to </p><p>consult closely with the GOJ before taking any action in the </p><p>case, and  to not/not expel Krekar to Norway.  He instructed </p><p>al-Ayed to contact the Jordanian Ambassador in the Hague, who </p><p>was to deliver the same message to the GONL. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>GOJ EXTRADITION REQUEST TO NORWAY IN TRAIN </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Al-Ayed confirmed in a subsequent conversation that </p><p>the Jordanian Ambassador in the Hague had expressed to the </p><p>Dutch MFA Jordanian concerns about the possible expulsion of </p><p>Krekar to Norway.  Al-Ayed said that the Dutch had advised </p><p>Jordan to submit a separate extradition request for Krekar to </p><p>Norway.  Acting FonMin Bak also spoke to the Dutch Ambassador </p><p>in Amman making similar points, and will see her on September </p><p>26.  Bak also plans to see the Norwegian Ambassador in Amman </p><p>separately on September 26. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Both before and after the conversation with Bak, we </p><p>talked with al-Ayed to make sure that the Jordanians </p><p>understand the possible need for making a separate </p><p>provisional arrest and extradition request of Norway. </p><p>Al-Ayed said that the GOJ had already begun the process of </p><p>requesting that Norway arrest and extradite Krekar.  Finally, </p><p>we understand that Jordanian GID Chief Kheir phoned PM Ali </p><p>Abul Ragheb on this case September 25, and that Abul Ragheb </p><p>subsequently called FonMin Marwan Muasher (who is currently </p><p>in Washington) to discuss next steps.  As of 1930 local </p><p>September 25, we do not know what follow on actions Muasher </p><p>may have taken. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>TECHNICAL ISSUES RELATED TO THE EXTRADITION REQUEST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  On other related topics, during the meeting with </p><p>Acting FonMin Bak, the DCM said that, even if this issue of </p><p>Krekar\'s possible expulsion to Norway is resolved, it appears </p><p>that the GOJ will still have to deal with two other technical </p><p>issues related to the extradition request.  First, the GOJ </p><p>will have to pledge that Krekar will not receive the death </p><p>penalty.  Second, the GOJ will have to pledge that he will be </p><p>tried only on the charges for which he is extradited, i.e. </p><p>narcotics trafficking.  Bak said that the GOJ is prepared to </p><p>pledge that Krekar will not be given the death penalty, and </p><p>that he will be tried only on the narcotics trafficking </p><p>charges on which the extradition is based.  He also said that </p><p>he would consider recommending that Jordanian Justice </p><p>Minister Faris Nabulsi contact Dutch Justice Minister Donner </p><p>to express the GOJ\'s very strong interest in progress on </p><p>their extradition request. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  Bak commented, however, that the twenty day delay in </p><p>the Dutch court proceedings may not provide sufficient time </p><p>for the GOJ to prepare the more detailed extradition request. </p><p> The military prosecutor\'s office, Bak noted, would have to </p><p>research and collect the related documents and court records, </p><p>prepare the request in Arabic, translate it and the documents </p><p>into English, then make sure the translations, format, and </p><p>procedures were proper.  He hoped the GOJ could be given more </p><p>than 20 days to produce the final extradition request. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  The GOJ is pressing ahead with its detailed </p><p>extradition request paperwork.  We have offered USG </p><p>assistance in reviewing the final documents to assure that </p><p>they meet Dutch court standards.  We recommend that the </p><p>Department contact FonMin Muasher in Washington to ascertain </p><p>what actions he might have taken today from Washington. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
