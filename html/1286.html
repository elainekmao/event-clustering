REASONS:  1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SOLOMON MUJURU, RETIRED COMMANDER OF THE ARMY, </p><p>RECENTLY SENT AN EMISSARY TO THE MDC, WITHOUT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE\'S KNOWLEDGE, ACCORDING TO A SENIOR MDC OFFICIAL. </p><p>THE EMISSARY INFORMED THE MDC OF THE GOZ\'S INTENTION TO </p><p>PROVOKE VIOLENT CONFRONTATIONS NATIONWIDE AS A PRETEXT FOR </p><p>CRACKING DOWN ON THE OPPOSITION PARTY AND ITS SUPPORTERS. </p><p>TO AVOID THIS BLOODY SCENARIO, MUJURU URGED THE MDC TO </p><p>AGREE TO A COMPLETE AMNESTY FOR CURRENT AND PAST GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS AND ZANU-PF LEADERS.  IN EXCHANGE, THE GOZ WOULD </p><p>DISCUSS FORMING A COALITION GOVERNMENT WITH THE OPPOSITION. </p><p>IF GENUINE, MUJURU\'S OFFER COULD BE A SIGN OF INCREASING </p><p>DESPERATION AMONG ZANU-PF STALWARTS, WHO SEE THEIR LOSS OF </p><p>POWER AS INEVITABLE AND WANT TO ENSURE THEIR IMMUNITY FROM </p><p>PROSECUTION FOR PAST MISDEEDS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, IT COULD </p><p>BE A TRAP INTENDED TO IMPLICATE THE MDC IN A PLOT TO </p><p>OVERTHROW MUGABE, AND JUSTIFY INTENSIFICATION OF THE </p><p>CRACKDOWN ON THE MDC.  THE MDC IS PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY AND </p><p>HAS NOT DECIDED HOW TO RESPOND.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PRETEXT FOR A CRACK-DOWN </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A SEPTEMBER 21 CALL ON DCM AND POLOFF, SENIOR </p><p>MDC ADVISOR CLIVE PUZEY SAID THE MDC WAS RECENTLY </p><p>APPROACHED BY AN EMISSARY FROM SOLOMON MUJURU, RETIRED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05346  01 OF 02  211600Z </p><p>COMMANDER OF THE ARMY, WHO RETAINS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE </p><p>OVER THE CURRENT ARMY COMMANDER, GENERAL VITALIS </p><p>ZVINAVASHE, WHOM HE INSTALLED IN HIS CURRENT POSITION, AND </p><p>THE ARMED FORCES. THE EMISSARY, GOODSON NGUNI (STRICTLY </p><p>PROTECT), IS A DISTANT RELATIVE OF A MEMBER OF PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE\'S FAMILY, WHO HAS BEEN A RELIABLE SOURCE OF </p><p>INFORMATION FOR THE MDC ON THE THINKING OF SENIOR GOZ </p><p>LEADERS, ACCORDING TO PUZEY.  NGUNI, THE MDC OFFICIAL SAID, </p><p>HAD APPROACHED THE MDC IN THIS CASE WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE </p><p>OF PRESIDENT MUGABE.  (COMMENT: POST HAS NO INFORMATION IN </p><p>ITS FILES CONCERNING NGUNI.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NGUNI REPORTED ON THE GOZ\'S PLAN, NOW UNDERWAY, TO </p><p>PROVOKE A GENERAL UPSURGE IN VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT ZIMBABWE </p><p>IN ORDER TO HAVE A PRETEXT TO CRACK DOWN ON THE MDC AND ITS </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  ACCORDING TO NGUNI, ONE BRIGADIER RUWODO (AS </p><p>SPELLED BY PUZEY), WHO WAS BROUGHT OUT OF RETIREMENT TO </p><p>MASTERMIND THE LAND OCCUPATIONS AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p>PRIOR TO THE JUNE ELECTIONS, HAS BEEN SUMMONED AGAIN BY </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE TO CONDUCT A SIMILAR CAMPAIGN OF TERROR. </p><p>(COMMENT:  POST IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH A BRIGADIER RUWODO. </p><p>THE NAME THAT COMES THE CLOSEST IN OUR FILES IS THAT OF </p><p>RETIRED BRIGADIER RICHARD RUWONDO, WHOSE LAST KNOWN </p><p>POSITION WAS DEPUTY CHIEF OF FINANCE OF THE ARMY.  A BANKER </p><p>BY TRAINING, RUWONDO IS UNLIKELY TO BE MIXED UP IN THIS </p><p>ENTERPRISE.  END COMMENT.)  NGUNI SAID 160 CENTRAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO) OPERATIVES HAD ALREADY BEEN </p><p>SENT TO KEY POINTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO CARRY OUT THIS </p><p>PLAN.  WHEN PEOPLE POURED INTO THE STREETS IN PROTEST, THE </p><p>ARMY WOULD SHOOT WHOMEVER IT HAD TO SHOOT, PUZEY QUOTED </p><p>NGUNI AS SAYING. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05346  01 OF 02  211600Z </p><p> </p><p>AMNESTY DEAL </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THERE WAS A WAY TO AVOID SUCH A BLOODY SCENARIO, </p><p>NGUNI CONTINUED.  SENIOR ZANU-PF LEADERS GREATLY FEARED </p><p>LOSING POWER, AS THEY HAD DONE MUCH WORSE THINGS THAN MOST </p><p>OBSERVERS SUSPECTED, AND WERE NOT WILLING TO SPEND TIME IN </p><p>PRISON.  IF THE MDC WERE WILLING TO AGREE TO A COMPLETE </p><p>AMNESTY AND TO DROP ITS PROPOSAL FOR A TRUTH AND </p><p>RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE, ZANU-PF WOULD BE PREPARED TO </p><p>DISCUSS FORMING A COALITION GOVERNMENT WITH THE MDC, AND </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD BE CONVINCED TO RETIRE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ACCORDING TO PUZEY, THE MDC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE </p><p>DISCUSSED NGUNI\'S PROPOSAL ON SEPTEMBER 20 BUT DID NOT </p><p>REACH ANY CONCLUSIONS.  SOME FELT THAT AGREEING TO THE </p><p>AMNESTY WAS PREFERABLE TO ALLOWING ZANU-PF TO DESTROY THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  OTHERS WITHIN THE MDC, HOWEVER, ARE NOT </p><p>INTERESTED IN COMPROMISE AND ARE DETERMINED TO BRING TO </p><p>JUSTICE PRESIDENT MUGABE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  YET A THIRD CURRENT, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE </p><p>NDEBELE, A BULWARK OF MDC SUPPORT, BELIEVES AMNESTY MAY BE </p><p>GRANTED TO ANYONE BUT MUGABE.

IF MUJURU WERE SERIOUS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL, </p><p>THOUGH, PUZEY COULD ARRANGE A MEETING WITH MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STRONGER MDC TIES TO PRETORIA </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) PUZEY REPORTED THAT TSVANGIRAI HAD RETURNED THE </p><p>PREVIOUS WEEK FROM A THREE-DAY VISIT TO SOUTH AFRICA ELATED </p><p>ABOUT HAVING MADE SERIOUS INROADS WITH THE PRETORIA </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THE MDC PRESIDENT SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT </p><p>OF TIME WITH FM ZUMA AND FINANCE MINISTER ERWIN, AS WELL AS </p><p>OTHER KEY CABINET MINISTERS TO WHOM TSVANGIRAI PREVIOUSLY </p><p>HAD HAD LITTLE ACCESS.  TSVANGIRAI, PUZEY SAID, HELD LONG </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH NELSON MANDELA, WHO UNDERTOOK TO SPEAK TO </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIALS AND LIBYAN PRESIDENT QADHAFI ABOUT </p><p>BRINGING MORE PRESSURE TO BEAR ON PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO PUZEY, MANDELA ALSO OFFERED TO ARRANGE A </p><p>MEETING FOR TSVANGIRAI WITH KOFI ANNAN. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WE FIND EXTREMELY CREDIBLE -- AND TROUBLING -- </p><p>NGUNI\'S WARNING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO PROVOKE </p><p>VIOLENT CONFRONTATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS A PRETEXT </p><p>TO CRACK DOWN.  THE GOZ (ZANU-PF) UNLEASED A CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>TERROR PRIOR TO THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS AND IS QUITE </p><p>CAPABLE OF DOING SO AGAIN.  PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS </p><p>CRONIES ARE WAKING UP TO THE FACT THAT THEIR 20-YEAR HOLD </p><p>ON GOVERNMENT IS INCREASINGLY THREATENED AS THE ECONOMY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05346  02 OF 02  211600Z </p><p>CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE AND THE MDC GAINS STRENGTH, AND </p><p>THEY WILL USE WHATEVER TACTICS NECESSARY TO STAY IN POWER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  WE ARE UNSURE, HOWEVER, WHAT TO MAKE OF MUJURU\'S </p><p>BACK CHANNEL OFFER TO THE MDC.  ON ONE HAND, IT COULD BE A </p><p>SIGN THAT SENIOR ZANU-PF OFFICIALS REALIZE THAT IT IS ONLY </p><p>A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL THE PARTY LOSES ITS MONOPOLY ON </p><p>POWER, AND ARE ANXIOUS TO STRIKE A DEAL PROTECTING THEM </p><p>FROM PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR MISDEEDS.  MUJURU\'S PROPOSAL OF </p><p>AN AMNESTY OFFER IN EXCHANGE FOR NOT ORCHESTRATING FURTHER </p><p>VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT SMACKS OF BLACKMAIL, BUT COULD </p><p>REFLECT INCREASING DESPERATION ON THE PART OF SENIOR ZANU- </p><p>PF STALWARTS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, IT COULD BE A TRAP </p><p>DESIGNED TO IMPLICATE THE MDC IN A PLOT TO OVERTHROW </p><p>MUGABE, THUS JUSTIFYING AN INTENSIFICATION OF THE GOZ </p><p>CRACKDOWN ON THE OPPOSITION.  THE QUESTIONABLE COMPONENT IN </p><p>MUJURU\'S AMNESTY PROPOSAL IS MUGABE\'S EXIT.  EVEN IF </p><p>MUJURU\'S OFFER WERE GENUINE AND THE MDC DECIDED TO MAKE THE </p><p>DEAL, IT IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR HOW MUJURU PLANS TO CONVINCE </p><p>MUGABE TO STEP DOWN, ALTHOUGH THE RETIRED GENERAL\'S </p><p>SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE ARMED FORCES WOULD PROVIDE </p><p>POWERFUL LEVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
