(A) 01 ROME 6545 </p><p>     B. (B) ROME 474 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER MARGARET DEAN </p><p> FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00620  01 OF 02  081322Z </p><p> 1.  (C) SUMMARY: WHILE PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI IS LIKELY </p><p>TO SIGN ITALY UP FOR THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER (JSF) PROGRAM, </p><p>THE PERCEPTION IN NON-DEFENSE MINISTRIES IS OF AN UNEQUAL </p><p>AGREEMENT, WITH INSUFFICIENT ECONOMIC/INDUSTRIAL BENEFITS FOR </p><p>ITALY.  ACCORDING TO MINISTRY OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES </p><p>AEROSPACE DIRECTOR (PROTECT) CUZZONI, NO ATTEMPT HAS BEEN </p><p>MADE BY THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE TO DEMONSTRATE THE ECONOMIC </p><p>OR INDUSTRIAL BENEFITS OF JSF FOR ITALY, LEAVING A PERCEPTION </p><p>THAT THE CASE CANNOT BE MADE.  ALENIA\'S ZAPPA HAS REPORTEDLY </p><p>GAINED SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT CIAMPI AND NATIONAL ARMAMENTS </p><p>DIRECTOR ADMIRAL DI PAOLA TO PRESS THE U.S. FOR A BETTER DEAL </p><p>(DURING DI PAOLA\'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON FEB. 12-13).  CUZZONI </p><p>DOUBTS THAT THE PENDING BILATERAL MOU WILL BE DERAILED, BUT </p><p>FEARED POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR BERLUSCONI IF THE CENTER-LEFT </p><p>PAINTS HIM AS HAVING SIGNED AN UNEQUAL ACCORD AGAINST ITALY\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC INTERESTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AT LUNCH FEBRUARY 6 WITH ECON COUNSELOR, ALFREDO </p><p>CUZZONI (PROTECT), AEROSPACE DIRECTOR FOR THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES, SAID THAT PRESIDENT CIAMPI HAD AGREED </p><p>TO TAKE ON THE PRIME MINISTER REGARDING JSF ON BEHALF OF </p><p>ITALIAN INDUSTRY (AND ALENIA IN PARTICULAR).  THIS WOULD BE </p><p>PART OF A COMBINED STRATEGY TO PRESS FOR A BETTER DEAL -- </p><p>CIAMPI AT THE HIGHEST POLITICAL LEVEL, NATIONAL ARMAMENTS </p><p>DIRECTOR ADMIRAL DI PAOLA RAISING THE ISSUE WITH EMBASSY AND </p><p>IN WASHINGTON MEETINGS ON FEBRUARY 12-13, AND ALENIA CEO </p><p>ZAPPA CONTINUING TO PRESS LOCKHEED MARTIN. ZAPPA HAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY CONVINCED DI PAOLA AND CIAMPI THAT -- IF THE GOI </p><p>REFUSES TO SIGN A BILATERAL JSF MOU UNTIL ALENIA IS SATISFIED </p><p>WITH ITS DEAL -- THE USG WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO LEAN ON </p><p>LOCKHEED TO BETTER ITS TERMS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00620  01 OF 02  081322Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ECON COUNSELOR POINTED OUT A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO </p><p>ITALY THOUGH JSF PARTICIPATION, INCLUDING EXPOSURE TO NEW </p><p>MANUFACTURING, DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT TECHNOLGY, LONG TERM </p><p>ITALIAN JOBS AND REVENUES BASED ON THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION RUN </p><p>RATHER THAN JUST THE ITALIAN RUN, BENEFITS TO ITALIAN SMES AS </p><p>WELL AS ALENIA AND FIATAVIO.  SHE ALSO DISCUSSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF PUTTING ASIDE THE OFFSETS/WORKSHARE MENTALITY, </p><p>AND LOOKING TOWARD THE BENEFITS OF MARKET/PERFORMANCE BASED </p><p>CONTRACTS.  CUZZONI RESPONDED THAT ITALY COULD ONLY COUNT ON </p><p>WRITTEN GUARANTEES, THAT STATEMENTS OF POSSIBLE FUTURE </p><p>BENEFITS HAD NO VALUE WITHOUT GUARANTEES AND THAT, IN HIS </p><p>MANY YEARS IN THIS AREA HE HAD SEEN U.S. PROMISES FADE ON </p><p>MANY OTHER DEALS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WHEN ECON COUNSELOR EXPLAINED THAT THE BILATERAL MOU </p><p>MUST BE SIGNED BEFORE THE INDUSTRY CONTRACTS ARE SIGNED, </p><p>CUZZONI WAS SURPRISED.  HE NOTED THAT NEITHER DI PAOLO NOR </p><p>DEFENSE NOR ZAPPA HAD TOLD HIM THIS.  "IN THAT CASE, WE HAVE </p><p>NO LEVERAGE. WE HAVE TO ACCEPT WHAT IS ON THE TABLE," HE </p><p>STATED. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CUZZONI NOTED THAT HE, HIS MINISTER (MARZANO) AND </p><p>MINISTER TREMONTI OF FINANCE ARE STILL SEEKING SOLID </p><p>SUPPORTING DATA ON ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM JSF FOR ITALY </p><p>(REFTEL A).  THE ITALIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY IS SOLD ON THE </p><p>MILITARY BENEFITS, BUT NO ONE HAS CRITICALLY EXAMINED THE </p><p>INDUSTRIAL/ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM THIS ONE BILLION DOLLAR GOI </p><p>INVESTMENT.  ABSENT ANY SUCH CASE BEING MADE, THE PRESUMPTION </p><p>IN THE MINISTRY OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES IS THAT THE CASE </p><p>CANNOT BE MADE.  AT THE SAME TIME, ALENIA AND FIAT AVIO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00620  01 OF 02  081322Z </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE TELLING THE GOI THAT THE DEAL IS NOT </p><p>SUFFICIENTLY ATTRACTIVE.  GOI OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT THE UK </p><p>SIDE LETTER OFFERED SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER TERMS FOR UK </p><p>INDUSTRY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) NONETHELESS, CUZZONI NOW THINKS THAT A POLITICAL </p><p>DECISION IN FAVOR OF JSF IS LIKELY.  HE BELIEVES THAT CIAMPI </p><p>AND ZAPPA WILL TRY TO DERAIL IT, BUT THAT BERLUSCONI WILL </p><p>DECIDE FOR JSF IN THE END.  HE IS CONCERNED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>CIAMPI AND ZAPPA MIGHT CREATE A PARLIAMENTARY AND PUBLIC </p><p>PERCEPTION THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SIGNED AN UNEQUAL </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH LITTLE ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR ITALY IN TERMS OF </p><p>TECHNOLOGY, JOBS OR MONEY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  ABSENT ANY INTERAGENCY PROCESS IN THE </p><p>INTERNAL ITALIAN DISCUSSIONS, THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE HAS NOT </p><p>EXPLAINED, AND APPARENTLY CANNOT EXPLAIN, THE COST/BENEFIT TO </p><p>ITALY OF JSF PARTICIPATION. ZAPPA (AND POSSIBLY ALSO FIAT) </p><p>HAS ARGUED TIRELESSLY THAT THE DEAL IS BAD FOR ITALY. </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTRY OFFICIALS SIMPLY CONVEY THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR </p><p>THE JSF.  THE EMBASSY HAS TALKED TO OTHER MINISTRIES, </p><p>STARTING AT THE AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL, TO EXPLAIN THE POTENTIAL </p><p>BENEFITS, INCLUDING THOSE BEYONE ZAPPA\'S ALENIA.  CUZZONI </p><p>WAS, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0267 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00620  02 OF 02  081244Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PC-01 </p><p>      PM-00    ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  EPAE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------640625  081244Z /45 </p><p>O 080915Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 2027 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000620 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEFENSE FOR DEPSECDEF AND USD AT&L </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, EAIR, PGOV, PREL, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: JSF/ITALY:  POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR MOU BUT ECONOMIC </p><p>CASE NOT MADE </p><p> </p><p>FIAT AVIO TO PRODUCE ENGINE GEARBOXES FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD </p><p>JSF PRODUCTION RUN.
