<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002858 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MEP; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "U.S. stumbling block to </p><p>      Palestinian state" the pro-government weekly "The </p><p>      Sunday Mirror" dedicated its December 22 editorial to </p><p>      accusing the United States of stalling the peace </p><p>      process in the Middle East.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will next month </p><p>      send a delegation to London for talks on a peace </p><p>      blueprint, which envisages an end to two years of </p><p>      violence in the region and a Palestinian state by 2005. </p><p>      However, the call by Israel on the United States. . .to </p><p>      go slowly on the `road map\' until Israeli elections on </p><p>      January 28 has poured cold water on expectations that a </p><p>      definitive document on the peace plan would be produced </p><p>      soon.  America\'s veto last week of a United Nations </p><p>      resolution blaming Israel for the killings of three </p><p>      U.N. staff in Palestinian territories and its excessive </p><p>      use of force raises serious questions about the </p><p>      commitment of both Israel and the U.S. to the peace </p><p>      plan.  It appears the unholy alliance between America </p><p>      and Israel is the single most significant impediment in </p><p>      the way of a lasting solution to the Palestinian </p><p>      crisis.  While U.S. President George W. Bush has </p><p>      expressed his commitment to the establishment of a </p><p>      Palestinian state, last week\'s veto underscored the </p><p>      hypocrisy in American foreign policy on Palestine. </p><p>      America\'s blatant bias towards Israel will certainly </p><p>      determine their response to the resolutions that will </p><p>      come out of the London peace conference, which has been </p><p>      called by British prime Minister, Tony Blair." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
