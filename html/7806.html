Members of DART Field Team West traveled from Jordan to </p><p>Ar Rutbah in western Iraqi on 26 April.  The team met with </p><p>local officials including the newly selected mayor, health </p><p>officials, PDS food agents, education officials and local </p><p>community members.  CARE sent two water engineers to Ar </p><p>Rutbah who provided a detailed brief of the water and </p><p>sanitation system and needs assessment to the DART.  The </p><p>DART also met with Coalition forces who have been present in </p><p>Ar Rutbah for the past several weeks.  Immediate needs could </p><p>be met with specific, targeted interventions so that the </p><p>stable atmosphere of the town can be maintained.  END </p><p>SUMMART. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>WATER </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>2.  There are approximately 25,000 people in and around Ar </p><p>Rutbah, which normally receives its water from three </p><p>different water treatment plants (WTP).  The main source is </p><p>a group of 12 wells that are located approximately 15 </p><p>kilometers (km) south of town.  Other sources are the WTP </p><p>located about 25 km south of Heet, and the WTP near Al Qa\'im </p><p>that draws from the Euphrates.  Water is piped through the </p><p>desert, and there are several points in the pipeline where </p><p>the Bedouin population can draw water out for themselves and </p><p>their sheep. (Note: there are approximately two million </p><p>sheep in this region that each require between three and </p><p>four liters of water per day.  End note.)  The pipeline </p><p>running from Al Qa\'im is not operational.  The pipeline </p><p>running from near Heet is providing water about only half of </p><p>the way through the desert to Ar Rutbah. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Electricity has not been restored to the town and, </p><p>therefore, the normal water system is still down.  However, </p><p>residents are receiving untreated water that is being tanked </p><p>to residences.  Coalition forces acquired generators that </p><p>are being used to pump water from eight of the 12 wells, </p><p>although four are at low efficiency.  The WTP is not </p><p>receiving power, and the two 525 kilovolt-ampere (KVA) </p><p>generators needed to operate the plant are beyond repair. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART discussed several immediate emergency </p><p>interventions to activate the WTP south of town and increase </p><p>capacity at the wells.  Interventions were also discussed </p><p>for improving the operability of the </p><p>pipeline running from the WTP south of Heet.  The DART will </p><p>continue to coordinate with CARE to develop implementation </p><p>plans to address these immediate needs. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The public distribution system (PDS), which serves </p><p>approximately 26,000 beneficiaries, is functioning in Ar </p><p>Rutbah.  All 63 Wakils (public distribution agents) are </p><p>accounted for and working.  The DART witnessed PDS Oil for </p><p>Food (OFF) deliveries to Wakils consisting of dry milk, tea, </p><p>salt, beans, sugar, soap and detergent.  This eight to ten </p><p>truck shipment did not contain flour, rice, oil or infant </p><p>formula. Food supplies are adequate; however, the Wakils </p><p>expressed concerns regarding future deliveries of flour, </p><p>beans, and oil.  Beneficiaries had maintained ration cards, </p><p>and no PDS system problems were reported.  Food was also </p><p>available in the market.  The Head of Wakils stated that the </p><p>last food delivery from Ar Ramadi was on 16 March, and the </p><p>last flour distribution was sometime before that, but still </p><p>in March.  He expects an unknown quantity of flour to be </p><p>delivered from Ar Ramadi on 1 May. Current private stocks </p><p>are probably adequate, but a more extensive assessment is </p><p>needed to confirm this. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Head of Wakils also reported that the mill in Ar </p><p>Ramadi was recently made operational, but had limited </p><p>milling capacity. This needs to be confirmed.  The shortage </p><p>of cooking fuel for private homes and businesses is a </p><p>concern as is security for food trucks on the main highway. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  Following the aerial bombing of Ar Rutbah\'s 40-bed </p><p>hospital during the war, some of the 50-member staff moved </p><p>to the city\'s remaining health facility, the Primary Health </p><p>Center (PHC).  According to its director, Dr. Farouk, a </p><p>pediatrician, the PHC receives 500 patients per day.  It is </p><p>short on essential drugs, although there are enough basic </p><p>stocks to last another month.  Lactose milk is used for </p><p>supplementary feeding, but supplies are low and too </p><p>expensive for purchase on the local market.  There is no </p><p>therapeutic feeding program.   Staff estimated the </p><p>malnutrition rate at ten percent.  The Center has depleted </p><p>its available oxygen, which had been of low quality. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Due to water shortages in Ar Rutbah, the health staff </p><p>has seen an increase in diarrhea cases, though they could </p><p>not provide statistics.  (Note: Medical records were lost </p><p>during the war.  End note.)  They have also treated children </p><p>injured by unexploded ordnance (UXO).  Again, no numbers </p><p>were provided, but two children were seriously injured and </p><p>another killed by a UXO incident two days prior to the DART </p><p>visit. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Dr Aziz, a surgeon and the former director of the </p><p>destroyed hospital, said that because the PHC is not suited </p><p>for surgery or in-patient care, patients are transferred by </p><p>ambulance to the nearest hospital, 300 miles away in Ar </p><p>Ramadi.  Before the war, the PHC had seven staff members. </p><p>It now has between 30 and 35 staff.  Dr. Farouk and Dr. Aziz </p><p>hope to convert the former Baath Party Building, </p><p>located across from the hospital, into a temporary hospital </p><p>facility.  The building was completely looted and would </p><p>require extensive renovation.  The remains of the hospital </p><p>were also looted and all administrative and medical records </p><p>were lost or destroyed.  Most patients in the hospital had </p><p>been deliberately vacated for precautionary reasons before </p><p>the bombing.  One patient and his father, who elected to </p><p>stay in the hospital overnight, were killed in the bombing. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The PHC has intermittent electricity, provided by a </p><p>generator, and water but no communication capabilities. </p><p>Staff sent letters to Ministry of Health (MOH) officials in </p><p>Ar Ramadi, requesting drugs and supplies, but were told they </p><p>would have to pay for them in advance as they had in the </p><p>past.  There are two public-private pharmacies in town, in </p><p>addition to the pharmacy at the PHC.  Many of the eight MOH </p><p>doctors in Ar Rutbah (seven men and one woman) also maintain </p><p>a private practice. </p><p> </p><p>11.  To date, the International Committee of the Red Cross </p><p>(ICRC), MDM-Greece, and World Vision International (WVI) </p><p>have visited the PHC and provided small quantities of </p><p>drugs.  World Vision, working with PHC staff, ICRC and MDM, </p><p>plan to deliver a supply of essential drugs on 28 April, and </p><p>would like to offer ongoing health-sector support to Ar </p><p>Rutbah over several months.  The DART has encouraged WVI to </p><p>submit an implementation plan for emergency health </p><p>intervention in Ar Rutbah. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SCHOOLS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  There are eight primary, three secondary, and one </p><p>intermediate school in town.  None of the schools suffered </p><p>damage related to combat, but several were looted.  Teachers </p><p>and school officials protected most of the schools from </p><p>looters, and the majority of teachers and students are eager </p><p>to get back to school.  Some schools have started back up. </p><p>However, a rumor recently spread that the Coalition forces </p><p>had said that schools nationwide would not start for three </p><p>months, so some teachers and many students </p><p>stopped attending.  Coalition forces and the mayor are </p><p>planning to get the message out to the community through the </p><p>mosques that those schools that can open, should open. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>UXOS </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>13.  Community members report the existence of numerous UXOs </p><p>around town, some dating back to the 1991 war.  Several </p><p>injuries have been reported over the past week.  While </p><p>visiting the former Baath party HQ (site of the proposed </p><p>temporary hospital), the DART witnessed a group digging up a </p><p>site in the compound that was full of UXOs.  Coalition </p><p>forces intervened to stop the activity. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  The town has selected a mayor and representatives for </p><p>the various government ministries.  Police have begun </p><p>patrols, and are manning checkpoints at the entrances to the </p><p>town.  Pay is becoming an issue.  Officials are recommending </p><p>that civil servants keep records of their time in order to </p><p>submit it to the relevant ministries once the national </p><p>government is stood back up. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
