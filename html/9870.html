<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 003618 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA AND INR/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 8/03/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IZ, AL, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  ORAL MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY POWELL TO </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE FOREIGN MINISTERS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  State 224109 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador used the opportunity of an August 4 </p><p>telcon with de facto Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamdan Bin </p><p>Zayid Al-Nahyan, who is out of the country, to deliver a </p><p>brief summary of the Secretary\'s oral message related to </p><p>Iraq and the Roadmap to Arab League Foreign Ministers (see </p><p>reftel). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Sh. Hamdan said the UAEG is doing everything </p><p>possible to support the situation in Iraq, as well as to </p><p>support the Iraqi Governing Council (GC) and the Coalition. </p><p>He told the Ambassador that the international community </p><p>should realize that there is no alternative to the current </p><p>process in Iraq, but that there is a real need to work </p><p>together to ensure a successful transition of power in </p><p>Iraq.  The Ambassador urged the UAEG to back the current </p><p>process, saying it would be helpful for public opinion if </p><p>there were a public expression of UAEG support for the GC. </p><p>Sh. Hamdan concurred, but added that such a public </p><p>statement from the UAEG in support of the process would </p><p>also convey the importance of moving as rapidly as possible </p><p>to form a permanent form of government.  He asked the </p><p>Ambassador if the US would have any problem with that </p><p>approach.  The Ambassador told Sh. Hamdan that reference to </p><p>a careful transition to a permanent government in Iraq, </p><p>coupled with a public recognition of the GC\'s interim role, </p><p>would be a balanced statement.  Sh. Hamdan requested that </p><p>the Embassy send the Secretary\'s talking points to the MFA </p><p>to allow his government to consult about issuing a public </p><p>statement.  The points were delivered before COB Monday. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
