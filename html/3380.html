(C) Summary.  Amid rumors of imminent fuel shortages </p><p>reminiscent of those that occurred in 1998, a local economist </p><p>estimates that Zimbabwe retains at best a one-month supply of </p><p>oil should pipeline and tanker shipments be curtailed.  The </p><p>southern and northern regions are serviced by different </p><p>supply sources and each is threatened by discrete factors, </p><p>both of which involve the lack of forex.  If both regions </p><p>were to lose oil supplies simultaneously, however, the </p><p>northern part would probably retain access to more fuel than </p><p>the southern part due to reserves currently stocked in the </p><p>local storage facilities.  For the moment, and in the absence </p><p>of the GOZ discovering an outside lifeline, it seems to be a </p><p>question of when -- not if -- the shortages set in.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Laboff met with economist John Robertson on July 23 to </p><p>sound out recurrent rumors of an imminent fuel shortage due </p><p>to the chronic lack of forex.  Robertson confirmed that he </p><p>has also heard the rumors, but he had no concrete information </p><p>indicating that suppliers have yet withdrawn.  However, he </p><p>confirmed that funding for both current major sources of fuel </p><p>is in jeopardy, and stated that Zimbabwe is "not far off" </p><p>from widespread shortages. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Currently, the northern part of the country is </p><p>serviced via pipeline from Mozambique through an arrangement </p><p>with Libya.  According to Robertson, the GOZ has been paying </p><p>for Libyan fuel through the transfer of equity in and </p><p>ownership of various Zimbabwean assets, including commercial </p><p>farms, the pipeline itself, and an oil storage facility in </p><p>Msasa.  (Note: Interestingly, an equity deal involving the </p><p>same oil pipeline and Msasa storage facility was reportedly </p><p>consummated with Kuwaiti sources for oil which was purchased </p><p>last year.  End note.)  As stated in reftel, however, Finance </p><p>Minister Simba Makoni reported that the Libyan Area Foreign </p><p>Bank has limited its investments in Zimbabwe to purchases of </p><p>shares in the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe.  Regardless, </p><p>Robertson reported that the Libyans are apparently tired of </p><p>being offered equity or Zimbabwe dollars, and are </p><p>increasingly insisting on payment in forex for their oil, due </p><p>to their own operational and production costs. </p><p> </p><p> 4. (C) By contrast, the southern part of the country -- </p><p>which for purposes of the oil distribution scheme includes </p><p>Victoria Falls as well as Beitbridge, Bulawayo, and Chipinge </p><p>-- is serviced by shipments from South African oil companies </p><p>(Sassoil), with the funding reportedly provided by </p><p>Zimbabwe-based businessman John Bredenkamp through a loan to </p><p>Mugabe.  The fuel for this region is brought in via truck and </p><p>rail.  Shortages have already been reported during the past </p><p>few months, including a period of several days during which </p><p>no fuel was available in the Bulawayo area.  This shortage </p><p>was relieved when fuel from stocks in the northern part of </p><p>the country was shipped in to Bulawayo via truck.  Funding </p><p>for the southern region is allegedly endangered due to </p><p>strained relations between Mugabe/the GOZ and Bredenkamp, who </p><p>reportedly is unwilling to increase his financial exposure to </p><p>the GOZ. (Note:  Robertson opined that some of the strain is </p><p>due to Bredenkamp\'s perception that a close relationship with </p><p>the GOZ is detrimental to his other business interests, which </p><p>is in fact evidence that inclusion on the US sanctions list </p><p>is effective.  End note.)  If Bredenkamp refuses to finance </p><p>future purchases, the GOZ will once again be scrambling for </p><p>enough forex to maintain shipments from South Africa.  Should </p><p>this alternative source of fuel dry up, the shortage could be </p><p>managed for a short period by trucking in fuel from the </p><p>northern stocks.  However, the capacity of the pipeline is </p><p>insufficient to provide fuel for the entire country, and if </p><p>the southern source is cut off, the reserves of the country </p><p>would rapidly be depleted. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) According to Robertson, there seems to be little hope </p><p>for new sources of funding for either the northern pipeline </p><p>fuel source or the southern road/rail fuel source.  Both </p><p>import schemes require large amounts of forex, which is in </p><p>spectacularly short supply.  There are few forex-generating </p><p>exports and even fewer forex-generating domestic businesses. </p><p>The GOZ is facing increasing pressure to purchase and import </p><p>food in addition to that provided through humanitarian aid </p><p>programs, and further economic reverses are expected. </p><p>Despite negotiations with the Libyans and other oil producing </p><p>nations, no new sponsor has appeared on the horizon. </p><p>Additionally, there appear to be no new sources for loans to </p><p>the GOZ, as there are no repayment prospects for either new </p><p>or existing loans. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: Although the rumor that "when the pig comes </p><p>through the pipeline, that\'s all there is" cannot be </p><p>substantiated, there is little doubt that Zimbabwe is facing </p><p>widespread fuel shortages within a month, should either </p><p>source be cut off.  The financiers of both current sources of </p><p>fuel are dissatisfied with the status quo. Unless some new </p><p>source of forex, or new benefactor, appears on the scene, </p><p>fuel shortages are not far away.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
