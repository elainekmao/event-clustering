REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON NOVEMBER 16 ZIMBABWE\'S MINISTER OF FINANCE AND </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SIMBA MAKONI, ANNOUNCED ZIMBABWE\'S 2001 </p><p>BUDGET IN A READING BEFORE PARLIAMENT.  IN OUR OPINION THE </p><p>BUDGET HONESTLY DEPICTS THE SEVERE ECONOMIC CRISIS THE NATION </p><p>IS TRAPPED IN, IS CREATIVE IN ITS ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS </p><p>PROBLEMS, BUT WILL FAIL TO SLASH THE DEFICIT AS PROJECTED. </p><p>(IT SETS DEFICIT TARGETS OF 15 PERCENT OF GDP IN 2001, 9 </p><p>PERCENT IN 2002 AND 4 PERCENT IN 2003.)  DOMESTICALLY, THE </p><p>BUDGET HAS RECEIVED MIXED REVIEWS.  ON THE ONE HAND MANY </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE HONEST ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS SERIOUS </p><p>DOUBT THAT SOME OF THE CREATIVE MEASURES HAVE ANY CHANCE OF </p><p>BEING IMPLEMENTED OR FOLLOWED THROUGH IN THE CURRENT </p><p>POLITICALLY-DRIVEN CLIMATE OF PRESIDENT MUGABE. ANOTHER </p><p>REASON BEHINDS ITS POSITIVE RECEPTION IN SOME QUARTERS IS THE </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION PROCESS THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER INSTITUTED DURING ITS DRAFTING. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE BUDGET PROJECTS TOTAL EXPENDITURES OF ZIM $224 </p><p>BILLION (APPROXIMATELY U.S. $4.7 BILLION, 2.6 BILLION OF </p><p>WHICH IS INTEREST ON THE DEBT), A 57 PERCENT INCREASE FROM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06566  01 OF 04  221629Z </p><p>THIS YEAR\'S REVISED OUTLAY OF ZIM $143 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY </p><p>U.S. $2.6 BILLION).  REVENUE OF ZIM $140 BILLION IS </p><p>PROJECTED, LEAVING A BUDGET DEFICIT OF ZIM $86 BILLION (U.S. </p><p>$1.6 BILLION), OR 15.5 PERCENT OF PROJECTED 2001 GDP. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 2001 BUDGET INCLUDE THE CONTINUATION </p><p>OF THE THREE PERCENT HIV/AIDS LEVY, A CUT IN THE TOBACCO LEVY </p><p>FROM 2.5 TO 1.5 PERCENT, INTRODUCTION OF A COMPUTERIZED CASH- </p><p>BUDGET SYSTEM AIMED AT STOPPING BUDGET OVERRUNS, A ZIM $1.3 </p><p>BILLON ALLOCATION FOR LAND RESETTLEMENT (ABOUT U.S. $23.6 </p><p>MILLION), A 13 PERCENT DECREASE FOR DEFENSE SPENDING (IN </p><p>NOMINAL TERMS), AND AN 18 PERCENT NOMINAL INCREASE FOR HEALTH </p><p>SPENDING.  THE BUDGET ALSO INTRODUCES A CAP ON THE CIVIL </p><p>SERVICE WAGE BILL, FROM THE CURRENT 16.7 PERCENT OF GDP DOWN </p><p>TO 12 PERCENT. HOW THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED IS NOT SPELLED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) OVERALL WE ASSESS THE BUDGET AS A GOOD EFFORT </p><p>CONSIDERING THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT. ON </p><p>THE POSITIVE SIDE IT IS NOT A HEAD-IN-THE-SAND EFFORT, AND IT </p><p>LAYS THE BASIS FOR AN ATTEMPT AT REOPENING DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  ON THE NEGATIVE </p><p>SIDE IT FALLS SHORT IN ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF HOW </p><p>INFLATION WILL BE TAMED, IT ASSUMES THAT FISCAL DISCIPLINE </p><p>WILL TAKE ROOT, AND IT IS EXCESSIVELY OPTIMISTIC IN </p><p>PROJECTING REVENUE IN A RAPIDLY SHRINKING ECONOMY, THEREBY, </p><p>UNDERESTIMATING, IN OUR OPINION, NEXT YEAR\'S DEFICIT.  THE </p><p>MINISTERIAL ALLOCATIONS, WHICH ARE ALL REDUCED IN REAL TERMS </p><p>AFTER FACTORING IN INFLATION WILL RESULT, IN OUR OPINION, IN </p><p>ANOTHER SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET BEING REQUIRED SOMETIME IN THE </p><p>SECOND HALF OF NEXT YEAR.  IN ADDITION AND IN THE END, </p><p>ACTIONS MUST MATCH THE RHETORIC AND WORDS.  WE ARE SKEPTICAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06566  01 OF 04  221629Z </p><p>THAT MAKONI WILL GET OR ACHIEVE ALL HE AMBITIOUSLY SETS OUT </p><p>TO ACCOMPLISH.

(SBU) INQS BUDGET SPEQ MINISTER MAKONI WAS BLUNT IN </p><p>HIS ASSESSMENT AND LISTING OF THE CAUSES OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC CRISIS, PAINTING A STARK PICTURE OF DAY-TO-DAY </p><p>HARDSHIP FOR THE AVERAGE ZIMBABWEAN.   HE ADMITTED THAT THE </p><p>CURRENT HARSH CONDITIONS HAD TURNED ZIMBABWE INTO A </p><p>CARICATURE OF COLONIAL-ERA POVERTY AND OPPRESSION; WITH </p><p>DEEPENING POVERTY, GROWING UNEMPLOYMENT, SHORTER WORKING </p><p>HOURS, RISING COSTS AND A DECLINE IN THE DELIVERY OF SOCIAL </p><p>SERVICES.  OTHER SYMPTOMS OF THE CRISIS CITED IN THE SPEECH </p><p>INCLUDE THAT MANY FAMILIES CAN NO LONGER AFFORD MORE THAN ONE </p><p>MEAL A DAY, THAT WORKERS - UNABLE TO PAY TRANSPORT COSTS - </p><p>WALK OR CYCLE TO THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT, FEWER CAN MAKE </p><p>VISITS TO THEIR RELATIVES IN THE RURAL AREAS, AND FAMILIES </p><p>AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE ARE INCREASINGLY FAILING TO CARE FOR </p><p>THE NEEDY.

THE LAND </p><p>AND AGRICULTURE BUDGET INCREASE (FROM ZIM $2.8 TO $4 BILLION) </p><p>IS CAUSED BY A SIX-FOLD INCREASE IN THE ALLOCATION OF $1.3 </p><p>BILLION FOR THE LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  (THOUGH THE U.S. </p><p>$23 MILLION EQUIVALENT FALLS FAR SHORT OF THE FUNDS NEEDED TO </p><p>PAY FOR EVEN A SMALL PORTION OF THE ACREAGE TO BE SEIZED, OR </p><p>THE INFRASTRUCTURE, INPUTS OR OTHER NEEDS OF THE RESETTLED </p><p>LAND-POOR.)  THE TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION INCREASE OF 63 </p><p>PERCENT IS CAUSED BY A ZIM $900 MILLION ALLOCATION FOR ROAD </p><p>MAINTENANCE, A SPENDING PRIORITY IGNORED IN RECENT YEARS AND </p><p>CONSIDERED NECESSARY BY THE FINANCE MINISTER TO KEEP THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S HIGHWAYS AND ROAD CROSSINGS USABLE BY COMMERCE. </p><p>THE VERY LARGE TRANSFER PAYMENT INCREASE OF 72 PERCENT SHOULD </p><p>BE NOTED (FROM ZIM $75 TO $130 BILLION), AS IT IS NON- </p><p>DISCRETIONARY PAYOUT FOR INTEREST, PENSIONS AND WAR VET </p><p>ANNUITIES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>GOVERNMENT REVENUE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.

IT ALSO PROJECTS THAT THE DISPOSAL OR PRIVATIZATION </p><p>OF STATE-OWNED COMPANIES SHOULD EARN ZIM $22 BILLION (ABOUT </p><p>U.S. $400 MILLION) IN 2001.  WE QUESTION IF SUCH AN </p><p>AGGRESSIVE ASSET SALES PROGRAM CAN BE CARRIED OUT NEXT YEAR, </p><p>AND IF THE EXPECTED PROCEEDS TOTAL IS REALISTIC GIVEN THE </p><p>CONDITION OF NEARLY ALL OF ZIMBABWE\'S PARASTATAL COMPANIES </p><p>(BALANCE SHEETS EXTREMELY IN THE RED AND DILAPIDATED/OUTMODED </p><p>ASSETS), AND ZIMBABWE\'S EXTREMELY POOR TRACK RECORD TO DATE </p><p>IN SELLING-OFF STATE ASSETS.  ALSO OF NOTE IS THE FACT THAT </p><p>THE FINANCE MINISTER APPLIES THE PROCEEDS OF PRIVATIZATION TO </p><p>THE PAYDOWN OF GOVERNMENT DEBT.  PREVIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS ALWAYS STATED THAT THE PROCEEDS WILL GO SOLELY TOWARDS </p><p>INDIGENIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>11.

EFFORTS </p><p>WILL BE MADE, THEREFORE, TO COLLECT THESE MONIES."  ALL THE </p><p>FOREGOING ARE CASES OF BLATANT LARGE-SCALE THEFT AND </p><p>CORRUPTION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEADERSHIP, AND WHAT, IF </p><p>ANY, PROGRESS IS MADE ON RECOVERY OR PROSECUTION WILL BE </p><p>WORTHY OF OBSERVATION.

(THE 2000 </p><p>WAGE BILL IS ABOUT U.S. $1 BILLION AT CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES, </p><p>OR A PER EMPLOYEE AVERAGE OF U.S. $6,200.)  MINISTER MAKONI\'S </p><p>PLEDGE TO KEEP THE CIVIL SERVICE WAGE BILL TO ABOUT 12 </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP IN 2001 (V.S. 16.7 PERCENT THIS YEAR) MEANS </p><p>THAT THE 2001 WAGE TOTAL WILL BE ABOUT ZIM $65 BILLION.  THIS </p><p>IS AN INCREASE IN NOMINAL TERMS OF ONLY ABOUT 18 PERCENT, AND </p><p>IT IS HIGHLY DOUBTFUL THAT ZIMBABWE\'S 161,000 CIVIL SERVANTS, </p><p>MANY OF WHOM ARE NEARLY ALL LOYAL RULING PARTY SUPPORTERS, </p><p>WILL ACCEPT SUCH A MEAGER SALARY INCREASE IN TIMES OF HIGH </p><p>INFLATION. </p><p> </p><p>=  CAPITAL SPENDING: CAPITAL EXPENDITURE HAS AGAIN DECLINED </p><p>AS A PERCENTAGE OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE TO ONLY 4.6 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE TOTAL (IN 1999 IT WAS 12 PERCENT, IN 2000 - 8 </p><p>PERCENT).  THE AMOUNT IS ZIM $10 BILLION, VERSUS THE </p><p>REQUIREMENT, AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE FINANCE MINISTER, OF </p><p>$75 BILLION.  THE ZIM $10 BILLION IS ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>- $1.3 BILLION FOR LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM (V.S. $200 </p><p>MILLION IN THE 2000 BUDGET) </p><p>- $1 BILLION IN A REVOLVING CREDIT FUND FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM </p><p>INDIGENOUS BUSINESSES </p><p>- $500 MILLION TO REPAIR CYCLONE ELINE DAMAGE </p><p>- $900 MILLION FOR ROADS UPKEEP </p><p>- $500 MILLION PROVISION TO MEET CALLED-UP GOZ GUARANTEES OF </p><p>PARASTATALS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06566  04 OF 04  221630Z </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) OVERALL, THIS BUDGET IS PROBABLY THE MOST HONEST AND </p><p>THOUGHTFUL THAT HAS BEEN TABLED IN ZIMBABWE\'S 20 YEARS OF </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  A LARGE NUMBER OF CONSTITUENCIES WERE </p><p>CONSULTED IN ITS FORMULATION, AND IT ALSO LOOKED CAREFULLY </p><p>BACK ON PREVIOUS BUDGETS, RESURRECTING IDEAS CONSIDERED </p><p>WORTHWHILE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE CASH BUDGETING SYSTEM WAS FIRST </p><p>PROPOSED IN THE 1994 BUDGET BY THEN FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>CHAMBATI.  IT COURAGEOUSLY OUTLINES THE PRINCIPAL CAUSES, AND </p><p>SOME OF THE HARSH CONSEQUENCES, OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC </p><p>CRISIS.  ITS ACTION INITIATIVES ARE ALL GOOD.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>BUDGET IS ALSO A COMPROMISE, ON BOTH THE POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC FRONTS.  IT CONTAINS A CONSIDERABLE DOSE OF HOPE </p><p>OVER EXPERIENCE, IN BOTH ITS REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND IN ITS </p><p>BLITHE ASSUMPTION THAT FISCAL DISCIPLINE WILL BECOME </p><p>INSTITUTIONALIZED.  THE LATTER ASSUMPTION IS A KEY ONE </p><p>DESERVING MORE SKEPTICAL ATTENTION.  JADED SENIOR CIVIL </p><p>SERVANTS TOLD THE ECONOFF THAT WHAT HAS NOT OCCURRED IN 20 </p><p>YEARS (GOZ FISCAL DISCIPLINE), WILL NOT LIKELY OCCUR IN YEAR </p><p>21.  (WE SUSPECT A SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET REQUEST WILL COME </p><p>FORWARD SOMETIME IN THE THIRD QUARTER NEXT YEAR.) </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO GIVEN THE HARD ECONOMIC TIMES, </p><p>ONGOING POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP AIMED AT WINNING VOTER\'S </p><p>ALLEGIANCE, AND NO EVIDENCE AS YET THAT ZIMBABWE\'S HARD TIMES </p><p>HAVE BOTTOMED OUT.  THE FINANCE MINISTER DOES NOT PREDICT </p><p>TURNAROUND UNTIL THE THIRD OR FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001.  WE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06566  04 OF 04  221630Z </p><p>PREDICT THAT THE NEXT SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS HERE WILL BE THE </p><p>WORSE THAT ZIMBABWE, OR FOR THAT MATTER RHODESIA, HAS EVER </p><p>EXPERIENCED.  THE HARD CURRENCY SHORTAGE WILL WORSEN, </p><p>BUSINESS CLOSURES WILL ACCELERATE, WITH ATTENDANT JOB LOSSES </p><p>AND SHORTAGES OF BOTH DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED GOODS.  IF THE </p><p>TURNAROUND DOES OCCUR AS ENVISIONED BY THE FINANCE MINISTER, </p><p>THEN IT WILL NOT BE UNTIL 2002 OR 2003 THAT ZIMBABWE WILL </p><p>RETURN TO AN ECONOMIC STATE OF HEALTH LAST SEEN IN 1997.  IN </p><p>OTHER WORDS, FIVE YEARS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, AT THE VERY </p><p>LEAST, HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT BY RECENT ACTIONS OF THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  WE ARE KEEPING OUR FINGERS CROSSED THAT THIS </p><p>HALF-DECADE BLACKOUT IS NOT EXTENDED FURTHER BY ANY MORE ILL- </p><p>CONCEIVED MOVES AND CAMPAIGNS THAT SERVE THE POLITICAL </p><p>EXPEDIENCY AND ENTRENCHMENT DESIRES OF THE FEW, AT THE </p><p>EXPENSE OF THE PRESENT AND FUTURE WELL-BEING AND SURVIVAL OF </p><p>THE MANY, REGARDLESS OF WHAT RACE THEY MAY BE.  WE HAVE, </p><p>HOWEVER, NO EVIDENCE THAT ECONOMIC COMMON SENSE WILL PREVAIL </p><p>OVER THE POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT "FAST-TRACKERS" NOW LEADING </p><p>THIS ECONOMY INTO AN ABYSS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
