<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/27/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, IZ, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AGAINST WAR IN IRAQ IN SANAA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1/5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  A large, peaceful and well-controlled demonstration </p><p>was held on January 27 in Sanaa expressing solidarity with </p><p>the Iraqi and Palestinian people and protesting a possible </p><p>war in Iraq.  Demonstrators gathered from different points </p><p>around the city to converge in mid-morning near the United </p><p>Nations common premises (approximately 25 minutes away from </p><p>the U.S. Embassy).  The demonstration was billed as a </p><p>general, all-party demonstration, and prominent Yemeni </p><p>politicians took part.  Presidential Advisor Abdul Karim </p><p>al-Iryani and Speaker of Parliament Sheikh Abdullah Ahmar </p><p>both gave speeches and marched with the demonstrators.  Crowd </p><p>estimates vary widely from 250,000 to 5,000, with the latter </p><p>being a likelier number.  Post used its radio net and warden </p><p>message systems to warn Amcits to avoid non-essential travel </p><p>during the demonstration, which did not approach the Embassy </p><p>premises. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Post received early warning of possible </p><p>demonstrations through press reports and contacts.  It was </p><p>apparent early in the day that the ROYG was well-prepared for </p><p>the demonstration, with hundreds of security officials </p><p>deployed around Sanaa and concentrated near the United </p><p>Nations complex.  According to security officials, several </p><p>busloads of protesters from varying tribal areas were brought </p><p>in for the demonstration.  A senior Yemeni security official </p><p>estimated the crowd in front of the UN at 250,000.  Embassy </p><p>assets estimate, however, a crowd closer to 5,000. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Although the demonstration appeared to be </p><p>well-controlled and peaceful from the beginning, post decided </p><p>to warn Amcits to avoid non-essential travel during the </p><p>demonstration through its radio and warden message systems </p><p>early in the morning.  By 12:15, post was able to disseminate </p><p>an all-clear message that the demonstration was over and the </p><p>participants were dispersing peacefully. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment:  Indications such as the high-profile </p><p>participants involved and the detailed security presence show </p><p>that the demonstration was probably orchestrated in part by </p><p>the Yemeni government as a way to let the Yemeni public blow </p><p>off steam.  It was peaceful and well-controlled, boding well </p><p>for the ROYG\'s ability to control future demonstrations and </p><p>ensure security.  End comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
