<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000168 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR JAMES E. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, EPET, ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: A CONVERSATION WITH THE POLICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 00148 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES. </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: A very discouraged Deputy Police Commissioner </p><p>(DPC) for Lagos State met with CG and Econoff on January </p><p>7 to discuss the recent fire at the national petroleum company </p><p>building and the realities of police work in Lagos State. </p><p>With an undercurrent of futility and resignation, DPC </p><p>Haruna John (please protect) presented his view of crime </p><p>and punishment in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>No way to run a poIice force </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Deputy Police Commissioner lamented that it is </p><p>impossible to live on a policeman\'s salary at any level of </p><p>the force. No officers can survive without engaging in the </p><p>corruption that flows from top to bottom. He explained that </p><p>Nigerian police constables earn about N5000 a month -- </p><p>approx. USD 45 -- when they are paid.  Police are forced to </p><p>supplement their incomes and often use "roadblock money" </p><p>(bribes extracted from motorists) to subsist.  John confessed </p><p>that he augments his income illicitly with a construction </p><p>business that is made possible by his position and rank on </p><p>the police force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Althouqh uniforms are promised by the government, </p><p>most policemen buy their own because there are never enough </p><p>for everyone.  Sometimes this results in incomplete </p><p>uniforms or uniforms of differing colors and fabric types. </p><p>Some policemen even chip in their own money to gas up the </p><p>police cars. Others use the courtyards of police stations </p><p>as places to sleep. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Asked why anyone joins the police, John stated that he </p><p>believes in the force although he admits that some use </p><p>it for criminal activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Some join because they see opportunities to make money </p><p>throuqh extortion or because they have no other prospects. </p><p>Despite a tradition of testing for competence, the police </p><p>force today checks neither background nor ability. </p><p>The illiterate, miscreants, and even those with criminal </p><p>records can and do join. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) It is not surprising that criminals, politicians, </p><p>and the public treat the police with disdain.  John explained </p><p>that when he first was posted to Lagos, he instructed his </p><p>officers to arrest criminals in the Oodua People\'s Congress, </p><p>a Yoruba vigilante and criminal orqanization. To his chagrin, </p><p>John was openly reprimanded and his instructions reversed. </p><p>In Lagos, he learned, the police don\'t arrest the OPC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>A Rawlings style housecleaning </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Pointing to the corruption of people in power, John </p><p>called the electorate apathetic and predicted that in April </p><p>the voters will elect "whoever gives them the most rice." </p><p>He expects election violence in many areas of Nigeria, </p><p>particularly the Western states, but he predicted that </p><p>Lagos will be relatively peaceful because it is an Alliance </p><p>for Democracy stronghold and virtually a one-party state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Visibly distressed and admitting that he hates </p><p>the military, John said that a Jerry Rawlings style of </p><p>housecleaning might be the only way to solve Nigeria\'s </p><p>problems. Reminded that corruption is not unique to </p><p>civilian governments, John rationalized that military </p><p>governments were surrounded by fewer sycophants and </p><p>supporters looking for financial favors. Therefore, more </p><p>money trickled down to the masses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DPC John said that all indications suggest the </p><p>December 24 fire at the Nigerian National Petroleum Company </p><p>(reftel) was deliberately set. He opined that the suspect </p><p>in custody was probably paid to torch the building by those </p><p>who wanted to cover up wrong-doing.  Looking pensive, the </p><p>DPC predicted that the true story about the fire would never </p><p>be exposed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment.  The Nigerian police force has long been </p><p>neglected by the GON and the DPC is willing to talk about it. </p><p>Without massive assistance, the Nigerian police force will </p><p>continue to be ill-trained and could not handle large-scale </p><p>violence should it arise in the course of the April 2003 </p><p>elections.  The police force in Lagos would welcome USG </p><p>assistance, even if only for a small number of police </p><p>officials prior to the elections.  DPC John realizes that it </p><p>will take a long time to address all of the police force\'s </p><p>problems satisfactorily. Meanwhile, he expects that extortion </p><p>and other abuses will continue as a way of life , as </p><p>will the force\'s bad relations with the community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
