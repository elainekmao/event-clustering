<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ALEXANDRIA 00548 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PGOV, PINS, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  LETTER FROM ALEXANDRIA:  RAMADAN II </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ALEXANDRIA 535 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE BAIRAM FEAST, WHICH FOLLOWS RAMADAN, </p><p>LASTED THREE DAYS IN EGYPT, FOLLOWED BY A WEEK-END.  EARLY </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, BETWEEN ALEXANDRIA SECURITY FORCES AND THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, MANAGED TO AVERT VIOLENCE ON THE </p><p>FIRST DAY OF THE FEAST.  HOWEVER, THE LETTER, IF NOT THE </p><p>SPIRIT, OF THE GOE BAN ON RELIGIOUS DEMONSTRATIONS WAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY VIOLATED IN ALEXANDRIA, AND RIOT POLICE WERE </p><p>DEPLOYED TO ENSURE ORDER.  MUSLIM BROTHER (AND MEMBER </p><p>OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, REPRESENTING THE WAFD PARTY) </p><p>MOHAMED EL MARAGHI WAS THE LEADING ACTOR IN THE FUNDA- </p><p>MENTALIST EVENTS IN ALEXANDRIA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE MONTH OF RAMADAN WAS AN UNEASY TIME IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p>(SEE REFTEL), A CITY WHICH HAS A HISTORY OF FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>VIOLENCE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT WAS IN ALEXANDRIA THAT THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERS ATTEMPTED TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT </p><p>NASSER IN 1954.  SHAYKH HAFEZ SALAAMA\'S CALL, IN CAIRO, </p><p>FOR A "GREEN" MARCH IN SUPPORT OF THE RAPID IMPLEMEN- </p><p>TATION OF SHARIA, OR KORANIC, LAW IN EGYPT (SEE CAIRO </p><p>15351, 15780 AND 15793), AND THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR\'S </p><p>SUBSEQUENT JUNE 12 DECREE BANNING PUBLIC MARCHES, </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE IN ALEXANDRIA: </p><p>ALL LEAVES FOR SECURITY OFFICERS FOR THE DURATION OF THE </p><p>FEAST AFTER RAMADAN WERE CANCELLED, AND POLICE WERE PUT </p><p>ON ALERT STATUS.  WHILE THE MINISTER\'S DECREE, IN FACT, </p><p>WAS VIOLATED IN ALEXANDRIA, INTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTALISTS AND THE SECRET POLICE--AS </p><p>WELL AS THE MASSIVE STREET PRESENCE OF RIOT POLICE ON </p><p>THE FIRST DAY OF THE FEAST--MANAGED TO AVERT VIOLENCE. </p><p>THIS IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH IT WILL BE FOREVER DIFFICULT </p><p>FOR FOREIGNERS TO MAKE TOO MANY INQUIRIES IN EGYPT.  WHAT </p><p>FOLLOWS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE EITHER TO OBSERVE, OR </p><p>TO OBTAIN FROM SECURITY AND OTHER SOURCES.  OUR CONTACT </p><p>WITH FUNDAMENTALIST CLERICS IN ALEXANDRIA REMAINS LIMITED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PRAYERS IN THE STADIUM:  DURING PRESIDENT SADAT\'S TIME </p><p>THERE WERE INAUGURATED,IN CAIRO AND IN ALEXANDRIA, </p><p>MASSIVE MORNING PRAYER SESSIONS IN PUBLIC STADIA ON </p><p>TBE FIRST DAY OF THE BAIRAM FEAST WHICH FOLLOWS RAMADAN. </p><p>THIS YEAR IN ALEXANDRIA, STATE SECURITY AND THE MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERS, LED BY MOHAMED AL MARAGHI, UNDERTOOK EARLY </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON HOW THESE PRAYERS WOULD PROCEED.  STATE </p><p>SECURITY FELT, PROBABLY, CORRECTLY, THAT THE OUTCOME OF </p><p>THE EVENT WOULD BE DECIDED LARGELY BY THE TONE SET BY </p><p>THE SHAYKH LEADING THE PRAYERS.  THEY PROPOSED THAT THE </p><p>GOE MINISTRY OF THE AWQAF REPRESENTATIVE IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p>(TECHNICALLY THE SENIOR IMAM IN THE CITY) LEAD THE </p><p>PRAYERS.  THE MB\'S INSISTED ON SHAYKH MEHALAWI--A </p><p>CHARISMATIC SHAYKH WHO BECAME A PARTICULAR TARGET OF </p><p>PRESIDENT SADAT IN THE FORMER PRESIDENT\'S LAST MONTHS. </p><p>(SHAYKH MEHALAWI WAS JAILED BY SADAT AND WE HAD HEARD </p><p>NOTHING ELSE ABOUT HIM UNTIL HE CAME INTO THE CONSULATE </p><p>GENERAL LAST YEAR, ESCORTED BY A BRIGADIER FROM STATE </p><p>SECURITY, TO OBTAIN A VISA FOR TRAVEL TO THE U.S.  SEE </p><p>84 ALEXANDRIA 329.)  THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR, </p><p>ACCORDING TO OUR ALEXANDRIA SECURITY SOURCES, CONTINUED </p><p>TO INSIST ON THE GOVERNMENT MAN.  THEREFORE, THE STADIUM </p><p>PRAYER NEVER TOOK PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  PRAYERS AT SIDI GABER:  SIDI GABER IS A PUBLIC SQUARE </p><p>LOCATED ON AVENUE EL HORREYA, THE CITY\'S MAIN THOROUGH- </p><p>FARE, IN THE CITY\'S AFFLUENT EASTERN SUBURBS.  THERE IS </p><p>A SMALL MOSQUE LOCATED NEXT TO THE SUBURBAN TRAIN STATION </p><p>ON THE SQUARE.  OUR STATE SECURITY CONTACTS TELL US THAT </p><p>THE MUSLIM BROTHERS CHOSE THIS MOSQUE FOR THEIR MORNING </p><p>PRAYERS JUNE 18.  OTHERS HAVE TOLD US THAT THIS IS THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL PLACE FROM WHICH THE BAIRAM MARCH TO THE </p><p>CITY STADIUM BEGINS, AND THAT THE SHAYKH AT THE NEARBY </p><p>MOSQUE IS A MB (SHAYKH MEHALAWI TRADITIONALLY HOLDS </p><p>FORTH AT THE IBRAHIM MOSQUE, WHICH IS LOCATED DOWNTOWN </p><p>AT RAMLEH STATION).  WHATEVER THE REASON FOR THE SITE </p><p>SELECTION--VICE ONE OF THE MAJOR MOSQUES DOWNTOWN-- </p><p>SUNRISE ON THE FIRST DAY OF BAIRAM SAW APPROXIMATELY </p><p>FIFTEEN THOUSAND FUNDAMENTALISTS GATHERED IN THE STREET, </p><p>SURROUNDED BY AN ESTIMATED ONE THOUSAND POLICE IN FULL </p><p>RIOT GEAR, COMPLETE WITH SHIELDS AND BATONS.  COMMENT: </p><p>BOTH THOSE FIGURES COME FROM POLICE SOURCES.  AN </p><p>EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN, AND CONGEN CONTACT, WHO HAPPENED </p><p>TO BE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME, HOWEVER, TELLS US THAT </p><p>THERE WERE "AT LEAST" THREE THOUSAND RIOT POLICE.  "I </p><p>BECAME VERY SCARED," HE SAID. END COMMENT.  TRAFFIC </p><p>(WHICH IS LIGHT AT THAT EARLY HOUR) WAS TOTALLY BLOCKED, </p><p>BUT THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE, ACCORDING TO BOTH WESTERN </p><p>OBSERVERS AND STATE SECURITY SOURCES.  THE CONSULATE </p><p>GENERAL\'S POLITICAL ASSISTANT (A MUSLIM) LIVES ON THE </p><p>SQUARE, AND REPORTED BEING "FRIGHTENED" BY WHAT SHE </p><p>OBSERVED, INCLUDING NUMEROUS WOMEN IN FULL VEIL--THE </p><p>ENTIRE FACE COVERED (AS IN THE GULF).  SHE FURTHER </p><p>REPORTED THAT THE PRAYER WAS EXTREMELY WELL-ORGANIZED, </p><p>WITH LEADERS DRESSED IN DISTINGUISHING GARB.  IT </p><p>APPEARS THAT THERE WERE INTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS AT THE </p><p>SCENE, BETWEEN SECURITY OFFICIALS AND ORGANIZERS, AND </p><p>THAT THOSE PARTICIPATING DID NOT ATTEMPT TO MARCH, BUT </p><p>DISPERSED IN AN ORDERLY FASHION AFTER THE PRAYER AND </p><p>SERMON.  SHE ALSO REPORTS THAT THE SERMON, BY MB MOHAMED </p><p>EL MARAGHI, CONTAINED DENUNCIATIONS OF THE GOE, CALLED </p><p>"TYRANNICAL" AT ONE POINT.  BY APPARENT AGREEMENT </p><p>BETWEEN THE SECURITY FORCES AND THE FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>ORGANIZERS, THE CROWD WAS ENJOINED BY THE SPEAKER NOT </p><p>TO RESPOND TO VARIOUS, REPEATED JIBES HE MADE AT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  REITERATING HER POINT ABOUT THEIR DISCIPLINE, </p><p>OUR OBSERVER NOTED THAT THE GROUP OBEYED THIS REQUEST, </p><p>ALBEIT WITH RELUCTANCE.  COMMENT:  MUSLIM BROTHER </p><p>MOHAMED EL MARAGHI WAS ELECTED TO THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY </p><p>(WAFD) IN THE HUY EHOIR ELECTIONS, REPRESENTING ALEXAN- </p><p>DRIAACXDCENTRAL DISTRICT.  WE HAVEKMET WITHRWIM ONCE </p><p>(SEE ALEX  QIIN PARA 21).  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SMALLER MARCHES.  THERE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY SMALLER </p><p>MARCHES, TRADITIONAL ON THE FIRST DAY OF BAIRAM, AT </p><p>OTHER LOCATIONS (WE SUSPECT THAT THE SECURITY FORCES </p><p>HAD INSTRUCTIONS TO PROHIBIT ONLY "GREEN" MARCHES)-- </p><p>IN CONTRAVENTION OF MINISTER ROUCHDY\'S DECREE.  ONE </p><p>OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THE OFFICIAL RESIDENCE, AND </p><p>INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED MEN (ONLY), MOST IN </p><p>TYPICAL MB DRESS--WHITE GALLEBEYA, SKULL CAP--AND </p><p>BEARDED, CHANTING THE TRADITIONAL BAIRAM PRAYER.  THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES STATIONED AT THE RESIDENCE DID NOT </p><p>INTERFERE AS THE MEN MARCHED PAST IN A HIGHLY-DISCIPLINED, </p><p>ALMOST MILITARY FASHION.  WE EARLIER REPORTED A DEMONSTRA- </p><p>TION ON JUNE 17, THE LAST DAY OF RAMADAN, IN FRONT OF </p><p>THE POLICE STATION IN THE WORKING CLASS DISTRICT OF </p><p>MOHARREM BEY (SEE CAIRO 16037, PARA 8). THIFDMARCH, OF </p><p>APPRTMIMALELY 300#$034 9, , WE HAVE SINCE LEARNED WAS </p><p>NOT A "GREEN" 76-4:#, BUT A TACTIC USED TO FORCE EYEN </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO PERMIT PUBLIC PRAYERS THE FIRST DAY OF </p><p>BAIRAM.  WE HAVE HEARD OF SIMILAR DEMONSTRATIONS AT </p><p>OTHER POLICE STATIONS AROUND THE CITY, FOR THE SAME </p><p>PURPOSE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  POLICE-MUSLIM BROTHER "COOPERATION:"  AS WE BELIEVE </p><p>IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE EVENTS IN ALEXANDRIA, THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES ARE IN DIALOGUE WITH MB LEADERS HERE: </p><p>THE NEGOTIATIONS ATNSTATE SECURITY, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE </p><p>CONDUCTED DIRECTLY BETWEEN GENERAL ABDEL HADI SAYED AND </p><p>MOHAMED EL MARAGHI.  WE ALSO SURMISE THAT THE FORCES </p><p>COUNTED ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL PROWESS, AND THE WELL-KNOWN </p><p>DISCIPLINE, OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD TO HELP THEM KEEP </p><p>ORDER.  WE NEVERTHELESS FIND THIS COOPERATION BETWEEN </p><p>THE GOE AND A STILL-BANNED ORGANIZATION CURIOUS.  IN </p><p>CONVERSATIONS ON THIS RATHER FINE POINT WITH EGYPTIAN </p><p>CONTACTS WE HAVE HEARD TWO COMPLEMENTARY RATIONALES FOR </p><p>THIS COOPERATION.  ALEX NDP PARTY CHIEF, MOHAMED ABDELLAH, </p><p>IN COMMENTS REMINISCENT OF REMARKS ONE HEARS ABOUT THE </p><p>CPUSA, INDICATED THAT THE MB MOVEMENT IN EGYPT IS </p><p>THOROUGHLY PENETRATED, CONSISTS LARGELY OF OLDER </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS AND IS NEITHER A DYNAMIC, NOR A </p><p>DANGEROUS FORCE IN THE COUNTRY.  THE BUSINESSMAN QUOTED </p><p>ABOVE (PARA 5), WHO HAS GOOD CONTACTS INSIDE THE SECURITY </p><p>SERVICES, CLAIMS THAT THE MB\'S ARE "QUIET" NOW </p><p>(RELATIVE TO PAST TIMES, ONE PRESUMES).  HE FURTHER </p><p>REPORTS THAT IT IS IN GOE INTEREST TO KEEP THE ORGANI- </p><p>ZATION BANNED, AS THAT ALLOWS THE SECURITY FORCES TO </p><p>MAINTAIN CLOSE TABS ON THE MOVEMENT.  COMMENT:  WE HAVE </p><p>HEARD RUMORS THAT THE BAN ON THE BROTHERHOOD MIGHT BE </p><p>LIFTED--BUT ALSO WORRIES EXPRESSED THAT THAT WOULD </p><p>SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL TO BOTH THE RADICAL MUSLIMS AND </p><p>THE GENERAL POPULATION.  WE IMAGINE THAT THE SECURITY </p><p>CONCERNS NOTED HERE MUST WEIGH HEAVILY IN GOE CALCULA- </p><p>TIONS ON THIS ISSUE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  "ISLAMIC GROUPS:"  WHAT DOES CONCERN THESE SAME TWO </p><p>SOURCES IS "AL-GAMIAT AL-ISLAMIYYA" (ISLAMIC GROUPS), </p><p>THE SHADOWY, RADICAL UNDERGROUND GROUPS WHICH OPERATE </p><p>ON A CELL SYSTEM, ACCORDING TO ABDELLAH.  ABDELLAH </p><p>SAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT KNOW WHO THEY ARE, OR </p><p>WHO LEADS THEM.  THE BUSINESSMAN SAYS THAT IT IS THESE </p><p>GROUPS WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PUT THEIR FEMALES INTO </p><p>FULL-FACE VEILS, AS NOTED ABOVE.  HE ALSO CLAIMS THAT </p><p>THE GROUPS ARE COMPOSED OF THE URBAN POOR, UNABLE TO </p><p>COMPETE IN THE DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT OF CONTEMPORARY </p><p>EGYPT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  WE DO NOT WANT TO EXAGGERATE THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF A GATHERING OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN A CITY OF </p><p>THREE MILLION.  (THE ONLY MEDIA COVERAGE OF THIS EVENT </p><p>WAS IN AN OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER, WHICH ALSO PUBLISHED TWO </p><p>PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE GATHERING.  A COPY HAS BEEN POUCHED </p><p>TO INR AND NEA/EGY).  NOR CAN WE EXPLAIN WHY SUCH A </p><p>MASSIVE DEFIANCE OF MINISTRY ROUCHDY\'S DECREE OCCURRED </p><p>ONLY IN ALEXANDRIA, NOT IN CAIRO (OR ELSEWHERE IN EGYPT, </p><p>TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE).  WE SURMISE THAT, AT </p><p>LEAST AS REGARDS ALEXANDRIA, THE SECURITY FORCES CAME </p><p>TO BELIEVE THAT A CONTROLLED GATHERING--EVEN ONE WHICH </p><p>COMPLETELY BLOCKED ALEXANDRIA\'S MAIN STREET--WAS </p><p>PREFERABLE TO A POTENTIALLY VIOLENT, UNCONTROLLED EVENT, </p><p>WHATEVER THE LEGAL TECHNICALITIES.  IN THIS REGARD, </p><p>THE MB\'S BOTH SERVED GOE PURPOSES AND PROVIDED A VENUE </p><p>FOR AL-GAMIAT AL-ISLAMIYYA--WHICH THEY WOULD HPXVE NEVER </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN THEMSELVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>DESPITE THE EARLY HOUR OF THE SIDI GABER GATHERING, THE </p><p>FACT OF ITS OCCURRENCE IS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE CITY, </p><p>AND HAS PROVOKED WORRIED COMMENTS FROM SOME OF OUR </p><p>CONTACTS--USUALLY ALONG THE LINES THAT, "THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SHOULD CRACK-DOWN ON THESE PEOPLE."  WITHIN THE LIMITS OF </p><p>RATHER SEVERE PERSONNEL CONSTRAINTS, WE SHALL ATTEMPT </p><p>TO EXPAND OUR REPORTING ON FUNDAMENTALISM IN EGYPT\'S </p><p>SECOND CITY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COOK </p><p></p></div>
