(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) This message has been coordinated with </p><p>AmConsul Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) SUMMARY:  There is little sign of an active </p><p>political Islamic movement in the UAE, primarily as a </p><p>result of the UAEG\'s support and promotion of a </p><p>moderate practice of Islam and the underdeveloped </p><p>political structure of the UAE (no political parties </p><p>or political opposition).  There are a number of </p><p>groups here with a religious agenda, the vast majority </p><p>of which follow a moderate practice of Islam in line </p><p>with UAEG policy.  The UAEG has used both carrots, </p><p>e.g., religious education, and sticks, e.g., </p><p>preemptive steps to check those it perceives to be </p><p>under Islamist influence.  The small number of Islamic </p><p>groups here do not appear to engage in activities that </p><p>meet the definition of political Islam.  The several </p><p>organizations with an Islamist bent thus far have not </p><p>collided with that policy, in part as a result of </p><p>their active monitoring by the UAEG.  Given the </p><p>situation on the ground here, we believe that a </p><p>continued low-profile approach which reinforces the </p><p>moderation espoused by the UAEG will best serve both </p><p>our short-term and long-term interests.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>UAEG Promotes Moderate Practice of Islam </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The UAEG espouses and supports in practice a </p><p>moderate interpretation of Islam (Ref B), the official </p><p>religion of the UAE.  Virtually all of the country\'s </p><p>citizens (less than 20 percent of the total </p><p>population) are Muslims, with approximately 85 percent </p><p>followers of Sunni Islam and the remaining 15 percent </p><p>followers of Shi\'a Islam.  We estimate that </p><p>approximately 55 percent of the expatriate population </p><p>are Muslim.  Expatriates are predominantly from South </p><p>and Southeast Asia, but there are also a substantial </p><p>number of expatriate Arabs. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The UAEG promotes the moderate practice of </p><p>Islam in a number of different ways.  The Ministry of </p><p>Justice, Islamic Affairs, and Awqaf operates as the </p><p>central federal regulatory authority for Muslim imams </p><p>and mosques and distributes weekly guidance on </p><p>religious sermons to mosques and imams, both Sunni and </p><p>Shi\'a.  Emirate-level Departments of Islamic Affairs </p><p>also provide oversight over mosques and imams.  The </p><p>Government ensures that clergy do not deviate </p><p>frequently or significantly from approved topics in </p><p>their sermons and monitors all sermons for political </p><p>content.  In June 2003, the UAEG initiated a public </p><p>religious education campaign to promote a better </p><p>understanding of Islam, including a one-year training </p><p>course for 166 imams (Ref D). </p><p> </p><p>UAEG Efforts to Thwart Islamic Extremism </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) After 9/11, the UAE senior leadership launched </p><p>a comprehensive top-down internal security review to </p><p>assess the impact of extremist thought and elements on </p><p>UAE society.  The UAEG closely scrutinized the </p><p>activities of the UAE\'s mosques, schools, academic </p><p>institutions, charities and NGOs. The UAEG also </p><p>rounded up about 160 people suspected of ties to </p><p>extremist groups for questioning.  As part of this </p><p>review, the UAEG passed comprehensive anti-money </p><p>laundering legislation, initiated tighter controls on </p><p>funds transferred into and out of the country, </p><p>assessed the country\'s charities and NGOs, and took </p><p>steps to eliminate cash fundraising at mosques and </p><p>channel all charitable giving through government- </p><p>regulated relief organizations.  (Ref C) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF) In an effort to reduce the influence of </p><p>Islamists in the educational and judicial systems, in </p><p>2002 the UAEG either transferred or early retired </p><p>around 60-70 educators and government officials </p><p>thought to be affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. </p><p>Although they were much more moderate than Islamists </p><p>elsewhere in the Gulf and in Egypt and were not/not </p><p>considered extremist in their views, some of those </p><p>sidelined are well known for their conservative </p><p>philosophy.  The UAEG has demonstrated zero tolerance </p><p>for the Muslim Brotherhood in the UAE, whose ultimate </p><p>goal it believes to be regime change and total </p><p>imposition of Shari\'a law.  (Ref E)  The small number </p><p>of "Islamist" intellectuals in the UAE have been </p><p>sidelined.  The UAEG continues to monitor those groups </p><p>and individuals deemed to be Islamist and/or </p><p>affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.  (Ref F) </p><p>8.  (C) Although Islamic studies are mandatory in all </p><p>public schools (UAEG-supported schools for primarily </p><p>citizen children) and in private schools for Muslim </p><p>children, the UAEG has worked to ensure that the study </p><p>of Islam is not overemphasized in the educational </p><p>systems.  There is high-level concern about extremist </p><p>influence on school curricula.  After 9/11, the UAEG </p><p>ramped up its revision of the K-12 public school </p><p>curriculum and is gradually replacing the large number </p><p>of expatriate Arab public school teachers with Emirati </p><p>nationals, over whom the UAEG has better control. </p><p>(Ref C) </p><p> </p><p>Political Islam -- Slim to No Presence in the UAE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The Government has been generally successful </p><p>in achieving its goal of a tolerant society.  While </p><p>citizens regard the country as a Muslim nation that </p><p>should respect Muslim sensibilities, and the majority </p><p>of them are observant Muslims, society as a whole </p><p>places a high value on respect for others and on </p><p>Islamic traditions of tolerance.  Citizens </p><p>occasionally express concern regarding the influence </p><p>on Emirati society by the country\'s foreign majority. </p><p>However, in general, citizens are familiar with </p><p>foreign societies, believe that they can best balance </p><p>foreign influence by supporting and strengthening </p><p>indigenous cultural traditions, and do not advocate </p><p>for legislation or government based on Islamic </p><p>principles. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) There are no elected institutions, no </p><p>political parties in the UAE and no political </p><p>opposition to the UAEG.  There is also a clear absence </p><p>of widespread pressure for opening up the system here. </p><p>(Refs B, C)  There is an acknowledged Salafi (highly </p><p>conservative and Wahhabi-influenced) presence in the </p><p>UAE, although there is as yet no identifiable Islamist </p><p>political movement in the UAE.  (Ref B) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) As a Muslim country, the UAE hosts a number </p><p>of NGOs in the UAE that have religious components as </p><p>well as social, educational, cultural and charitable </p><p>ones.  NGOs here are funded in whole or part by the </p><p>UAEG, an effective mechanism of control, and do not </p><p>generally receive funding from foreign sources. </p><p>Foreign funding, if received, is closely scrutinized </p><p>by the authorities.  If/when these groups express </p><p>anti-American sentiment, it is almost invariably on </p><p>grounds of U.S. foreign policy rather than religious </p><p>grounds. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C/NF) Most groups with religious components may </p><p>sponsor Quranic instruction courses and religious </p><p>workshops and lectures on Islam and require/encourage </p><p>their members to maintain and uphold Islamic </p><p>traditions and values.  Examples: </p><p> </p><p>--Dar Al-Bir Society (org. 1979), Dubai </p><p>--Women\'s Union Association (org. 1973), Sharjah </p><p>--Umm Al-Quwain Woman\'s Society (org. 1974), UAQ </p><p>--Fujairah Welfare Association (org. 1987), Fujairah </p><p>--Nahda Woman\'s Association (org. 1979), Ras Al- </p><p>Khaimah </p><p> </p><p>Available information indicates that these groups </p><p>support a moderate view of Islam in line with UAEG </p><p>policy, have domestic agendas, and do not advocate an </p><p>Islamic government based on Shari\'a law.  Based on </p><p>available information, we believe that these groups </p><p>would engage in a democratic/pluralistic process and </p><p>do/would respect the rights of others as well as the </p><p>principle of alternance of government.  Accordingly, </p><p>these groups would fall into category D as described </p><p>in Ref A para. 4. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C/NF) Several NGOs are public proponents of </p><p>Islamic legislation or governance based on Islamic </p><p>principles.  Available information indicates that </p><p>these groups practice a moderate interpretation of </p><p>Islam in line with UAEG policy and would be willing to </p><p>engage in a democratic, pluralistic process.  We do </p><p>not have information to conclude that these groups </p><p>would not respect the rights of non-Islamists, </p><p>secularists and/or minorities.  Accordingly, these </p><p>groups would fall into category D as described in Ref </p><p>A para. 4: </p><p> </p><p>--Reform Society (org. 1994), Dubai </p><p>--Jurists Association (org. 1980), Sharjah </p><p>--Umm Al-Moumineen Women\'s Association (org. 1974), </p><p>Ajman </p><p>--Social Guidance Association (org. 1981), Ajman </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C/NF) We have little information on the </p><p>following two groups; however, they publicly </p><p>acknowledge one of their aims as working against </p><p>influences that have a negative impact on their </p><p>society.  We have no information to suggest that these </p><p>two organizations are anti-democratic and anti- </p><p>pluralistic.  Based on their public acknowledgements, </p><p>however, it appears that, if in the unlikely event </p><p>they obtained full political power, they might not </p><p>respect the rights of non-Islamists, secularists, </p><p>and/or minorities.  Accordingly, these groups would </p><p>fall into category C as described in Ref A para. 4: </p><p> </p><p>--Al Muntada Al Islami (org. 1996), Sharjah </p><p>--Irshad and Tawjih (org. 1983), Ras Al-Khaimah </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C/NF) Under the leadership of President Zayed, </p><p>the UAE has practiced a policy of tolerance and </p><p>moderation.  Our regular engagement with the NGO </p><p>community -- in a low-key manner and not in an overtly </p><p>political context -- confirms that the UAEG has </p><p>largely been successful in this regard.  The UAEG has </p><p>taken affirmative and preemptive action, without USG </p><p>prompting, to ensure that Islamic extremism does not </p><p>take root in their country.  We expect that the UAEG\'s </p><p>zero-tolerance policy, applied in a thus far </p><p>relatively non-repressive manner, will do much to </p><p>prevent political Islam from raising its head here. </p><p>As discussed in Ref C, our behind-the-scenes </p><p>partnership with the Emiratis has worked in both </p><p>sides\' favor, and we believe that in the UAE, a </p><p>continued low-profile, positive reinforcement approach </p><p>will serve our short-term as well as long-term </p><p>interests in this regard. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
