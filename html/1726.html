<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 CAIRO 003303 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/2005 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PGOV, PTER, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: EGYPT\'S MUSLIM BROTHERS - PART I: HISTORY AND </p><p>STRUCTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 2000 CAIRO 2785 </p><p>     B. 2000 CAIRO 3178 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY A/DCM RICHARD LEBARON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THIS IS THE FIRST IN A TWO PART MESSAGE DISCUSSING </p><p>EGYPT\'S MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  PART 1 OUTLINES ITS HISTORY AND </p><p>STRUCTURE, PART 2 OF THE MESSAGE WILL DISCUSS THE BASES FOR </p><p>THE MB\'S POPULARITY AS A POLITICAL FORCE IN EGYPT TODAY. </p><p>EGYPT\'S (ILLEGAL) MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, FOUNDED IN 1928, IS A </p><p>PART OF THE COUNTRY\'S HISTORY AND ITS PRESENT POLITICAL LIFE. </p><p> THE ORGANIZATION\'S HISTORY IS CHECKERED WITH ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS VIOLENT ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.  THE MB IS THE ORGANIZATION FROM </p><p>WHICH THE VIOLENT ELEMENTS, THE GAMA\'A ISLAMIYYA, THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD AND THE VANGUARDS OF CONQUEST </p><p>SPLINTERED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DESPITE GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO STIFLE THEIR POLITICAL </p><p>ASPIRATIONS, 17 MUSLIM BROTHERS WERE ELECTED IN FALL 2000 AS </p><p>INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES TO THE NATIONAL PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY AND </p><p>IN FEBRUARY THEY CAPTURED ONE-THIRD OF THE SEATS ON THE BOARD </p><p>OF EGYPT\'S LAWYERS SYNDICATE.  TODAY, THE AGING MB LEADERSHIP </p><p>IS HESITANT TO TURN OVER THE REINS TO YOUNGER MEMBERS, </p><p>CAUSING WHAT SOME VIEW AS AN INTERNAL RIFT.  YOUNGER LEADERS </p><p>ARE THOUGHT TO REPRESENT A MORE CONTEMPORARY AND LIBERAL </p><p>TREND, REFERRED TO AS "DOVES" WHILE THE OLDER LEADERS ARE </p><p>THOUGHT TO BE SOMEWHAT SCLEROTIC "HAWKS."  DUE TO THE SECRET </p><p>NATURE OF THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE MB SHURA (CONSULTATIVE) </p><p>COUNCIL, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHO WILL SUCCEED THE CURRENT AGED </p><p>SUPREME GUIDE MUSTAFA MESHHOUR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>AN HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) IS PART OF EGYPT\'S </p><p>HISTORIC AND CURRENT POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.  DESPITE ITS </p><p>ILLEGAL STATUS THE MB IS A SIGNIFICANT FORCE IN CURRENT </p><p>EGYPTIAN POLITICAL LIFE.  FOUNDED BY SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHER </p><p>SHIEKH HASSAN AL BANNA IN ISMAILIA IN 1928, THE ASSOCIATION </p><p>OF MUSLIM BROTHERS WAS THE FIRST WIDE-SCALE, ORGANIZED, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIST MOVEMENT.  SINCE ITS FOUNDING IT HAS </p><p>REMAINED A SEMISECRET ORGANIZATION, WITH A CELLULAR </p><p>ORGANIZATION AND A FOCUS ON ATTRACTING YOUTH.  SOME YOUTH </p><p>GROUPS WERE KNOWN TO BE PARAMILITARY.  THE MB HAS A NETWORK </p><p>OF SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND </p><p>ENTERPRISES.  TITHING ("ZAKAT") OF MEMBERS ALSO HELPS TO </p><p>FINANCE THE ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) IN ADDITION TO PLAYING A PART IN RESISTING AND </p><p>FINALLY ENDING THE BRITISH OCCUPATION OF EGYPT, IN 1948 THE </p><p>MB DEFINED TWO ORGANIZATIONAL OBJECTIVES: IMPLEMENTING AN </p><p>ISLAMIC SOCIAL SYSTEM AND CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIAL SERVICE IN </p><p>EGYPT.  FOR A PERIOD IN BETWEEN WWII AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE </p><p>MILITARY REGIME IN 1952, KING FAROUQ PERMITTED THE MB TO </p><p>FUNCTION AS A POLITICAL PARTY TO COUNTER THE POWER OF THE </p><p>WAFD PARTY.  IN 1948, MB VOLUNTEERS PARTICIPATED IN THE WAR </p><p>FOR PALESTINE.  UPON THEIR RETURN TO CAIRO, THEY WERE ACCUSED </p><p>OF PLOTTING AGAINST THE MONARCHY WITH THE INTENT OF </p><p>ESTABLISHING A THEOCRATIC REPUBLIC.  PRIME MINISTER MAHMOUD </p><p>EL NOQRASHI STRUCK FIRST, ISSUING A DECREE DISSOLVING THE MB, </p><p>IMPOUNDING ITS ASSETS AND ARRESTING ITS MEMBERS.  TWENTY DAYS </p><p>LATER, A YOUNG MB MEMBER ASSASSINATED NOQRASHI.  IN EARLY </p><p>1949, THE MB SUPREME GUIDE EL BANNA WAS MURDERED, IT WAS </p><p>RUMORED, BY GOVERNMENT AGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) AN INTENSE PERIOD OF UNDERGROUND ACTIVITY FOLLOWED. </p><p>A NEW SUPREME GUIDE, HASAN EL HODEIBY TOOK OVER AS HEAD OF </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION.  IN 1951, THE COURT LIFTED THE BAN AND THE </p><p>MB WAS PERMITTED TO RECOVER SOME OF ITS ASSETS AND RESUME </p><p>OVERT ACTIVITIES AFTER THE WAFD PARTY WON THE ELECTIONS AND </p><p>FORMED A NEW GOVERNMENT.  SHORTLY AFTER THE REVOLUTION, A </p><p>1953 DECREE BANNING POLITICAL PARTIES WAS DEEMED NOT TO APPLY </p><p>TO THE MB ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT WAS NOT A POLITICAL PARTY. </p><p>NONETHELESS, IN 1954, NASSER INVOKED THE DECREE, DISSOLVING </p><p>THE MB, WHICH WAS PLOTTING HIS OVERTHROW AND ROUNDED UP </p><p>THOUSANDS OF MBS.  SIX MB LEADERS WERE TRIED, CONVICTED AND </p><p>EXECUTED; 7 WERE SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN 1960, MB DISSENTERS, LEAD BY SAYYED QUTUB, OPENLY </p><p>ADVOCATED THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO OVERTHROW NASSER\'S "APOSTATE </p><p>REGIME."  ONCE AGAIN, MASSIVE ARRESTS OF MB LEADERS AND </p><p>MEMBERS TOOK PLACE.  AFTER NASSER\'S DEATH IN 1970, SADAT </p><p>RELEASED A NUMBER OF JAILED MBS AND THE MAINSTREAM </p><p>ORGANIZATION RENOUNCED VIOLENCE AS A TACTIC.  BOLSTERED BY </p><p>ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH SADAT, THE MB IN 1977 ASKED THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE COURT TO LIFT THE 1954 MILITARY DECREE BANNING </p><p>IT.  THE COURT REFUSED TO OVERTURN THE BAN AND IN 1992 AN </p><p>APPEAL (STILL UNRESOLVED) WAS FILED WITH A HIGHER COURT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE MB CARRIED WITH IT TRADITIONS OF IDEALISM AND </p><p>VIOLENCE, PIETY AND TERROR, WHICH HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO </p><p>DISENTANGLE AND SEVER.  AS THE ORGANIZATION TRIED TO MODERATE </p><p>ITS POSTURE IN THE 1970\'S, MILITANT ISLAMIC FACTIONS </p><p>INCLUDING THE GAMA\'A ISLAMIYYA, EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD AND </p><p>VANGUARDS OF CONQUEST SPRANG FROM ITS RANKS.  SINCE THE </p><p>ATTACKS UPON TOURISTS IN CAIRO AND LUXOR IN 1997, EXTREMIST </p><p>ISLAMIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN SEVERELY CRIPPLED BY THE SECURITY </p><p>SERVICES AND POPULARLY DISCREDITED.  LUXOR SEEMED TO DEEPEN </p><p>THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE MB AND ITS EXTREMIST OFFSPRING.  AL </p><p>HAYAT REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING THE ATTACK IN LUXOR, THE MB </p><p>LEADERSHIP WARNED ITS MEMBERS TO HAVE NO CONTACT WITH THE </p><p>ATTACKERS WHO HAVE "NO RELIGION AND NO CONSCIENCE." </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>THE MB TODAY </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) FOR FIFTY YEARS, SUCCESSIVE EGYPTIAN REGIMES HAVE </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO SUPPRESS OR ELIMINATE THE MB, YET THE MOVEMENT </p><p>SURVIVES.  AN ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION SINCE 1954, MB LEADERS ARE </p><p>PERPETUALLY IN AND OUT OF JAIL AS THE GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>CONTROL OR SHUT DOWN MB ACTIVITIES, THE MOST OBVIOUS OF WHICH </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE APPLYING AN ISLAMIC SOCIAL SYSTEM AND </p><p>DELIVERING SOCIAL SERVICES.  THEY PARTICIPATED IN THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY AS SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY MEMBERS IN THE </p><p>1980S.  IN COORDINATION WITH THE SLP, THE MB WON 37 SEATS IN </p><p>THE 1987 LEGISLATURE.  THEIR PROMINENCE CALLED INTO DOUBT </p><p>THEIR COMPETENCE, WITH ONLY DR. ESSAM EL ARIAN RECOGNIZED AS </p><p>A SERIOUS PARLIAMENTARIAN.  THE MB BOYCOTTED THE FOLLOWING </p><p>ELECTIONS UNTIL THE FALL 2000 ELECTIONS.  IN SEPTEMBER 2000, </p><p>DURING A RARE SHOW OF STRENGTH AT THE FUNERAL OF MB SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL IBRAHIM SHARAF, SUPREME GUIDE MUSTAFA MESHHOUR </p><p>PREDICTED THAT THE MB WOULD ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE IN </p><p>EGYPT BY THE YEAR 2030. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE ASSOCIATION OF MUSLIM BROTHERS IS HEADED BY A </p><p>SUPREME GUIDE, ASSISTED BY A GENERAL GUIDANCE COUNCIL, </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR FORMULATING POLICIES AND RUNNING THE GROUP\'S </p><p>ACTIVITIES, AND BY A SHURA OR CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL.  WE KNOW </p><p>LITTLE ABOUT THE DECISION-MAKING BY THE MB LEADERSHIP WHOSE </p><p>MEETINGS ARE CLANDESTINE.  LIKE A NUMBER OF EGYPTIAN </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES, THE MB IS TODAY HEADED BY ELDERLY </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  THE ORGANIZATION FACES THE CHALLENGE OF MAKING </p><p>WAY FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION, REPRESENTED BY LEADERS IN </p><p>THEIR 40\'S AND EARLY 50\'S LIKE DR. ESSAM EL ARIAN AND DR. </p><p>IBRAHIM ZAAFARANI OF THE DOCTORS\' SYNDICATE, AND JOURNALIST </p><p>SYNDICATE LEADER SALAH ABDEL MAQSOUD. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE MB SUPPORTED ABOUT 40 CANDIDATES WHO RAN AS </p><p>INDEPENDENTS IN THE 2000 ELECTIONS FOR THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY </p><p>(LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT).  OF THE 444 ELECTED SEATS, 17 </p><p>WENT TO MUSLIM BROTHER INDEPENDENTS.  EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE </p><p>MBS ELECTED ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 45.  THE VAST DIVIDE BETWEEN </p><p>AGED AND YOUTH MEMBERS WAS PERHAPS MOST PRONOUNCED IN 1996 </p><p>WHEN YOUNG MB LEADERS JOINED WITH OTHER NON-MB POLITICAL </p><p>CENTRISTS TO SEEK APPROVAL FOR A WASSAT (CENTER) PARTY. </p><p>WASSAT WAS NOT APPROVED BY THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>COMMITTEE, BUT THE YOUNG MB\'S REBELLIOUS ACTIONS LED TO A </p><p>RIFT WITHIN THE MB STRUCTURE.  ACCORDING TO ONE ISLAMIST </p><p>EXPERT, "FOR THE FIRST TIME IN RECOLLECTION, MB LEADERSHIP </p><p>AND ITS CENTRALIZED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE CAME UNDER FIRE </p><p>FROM RANK AND FILE MEMBERS."  THE PRAGMATIC, DYNAMIC YOUNG </p><p>MBS INCLUDING EL ARIAN, MAQSOUD AND ZAAFARANI, IMPRISONED </p><p>FROM 1995-2000 WERE INCAPABLE OF PULLING THE ORGANIZATION </p><p>BACK FROM THE BRINK OF DISCORD AND DEMORALIZATION.  WASAT </p><p>SYMPATHIZERS REMAIN OUTSIDE THE MB MAINSTREAM TODAY.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S METHOD OF COPING WITH THE POPULARITY OF YOUNGER </p><p>MB LEADERSHIP CONTINUES TO BE DETENTION, TRIAL, AND </p><p>IMPRISONMENT.  IN NOVEMBER 2000, 15 MBS, MOST OF THEM </p><p>PROFESSIONALS ACTIVE IN THE SYNDICATES AND POTENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATES FOR THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY, WERE SENTENCED TO 3-5 </p><p>YEARS IN PRISON FOR MEMBERSHIP IN AN ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION AND </p><p>RELATED CHARGES. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>HAWKS AND DOVES -- A GENERATION GAP </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) MOST LEADERS OF THE MB TODAY APPEAR TO FALL INTO </p><p>EITHER "HAWK" OR "DOVE" CAMPS.  SUPREME GUIDE MESHHOUR </p><p>REPRESENTS THE OLD GUARD, THE MORE "HAWKISH" LEADERSHIP, </p><p>REVOLUTIONARIES REARED DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD, SOME </p><p>ACCUSED OF VIOLENT ACTS.  TODAY, HE CLAIMS, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>FEARS THE FACT THAT THE MB IS A "WELL-ORGANIZED ENTITY" </p><p>RATHER THAN AN ADVOCATE OF VIOLENCE.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE </p><p>BOTH THE GENERATION GAP AND THE DIFFERENCE IN VIEWS AND </p><p>TACTICS HAVE BEEN SOURCES OF CONTENTION BETWEEN THE HAWKS AND </p><p>THE DOVES WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION.  ACCORDING TO AL AHRAM </p><p>WRITER OMAYMA ABDEL-LATIF, THE HAWKS INCLUDE MESHHOUR, MB </p><p>SPOKESMAN MAHMOUN EL HODEIBI, ABBAS EL SISSI AND MAHMOUD </p><p>EZZAT IBRAHIM, SOMETIMES MENTIONED AS A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR TO </p><p>MESHHOUR.  OTHER HARD LINERS INCLUDE ABDEL MONEIM ABDUL </p><p>FUTUH, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PHYSICIANS\' SYNDICATE; </p><p>MOHAMED EL SAYED HABIB, FORMER MP AND PROFESSOR AT ASSIYUT </p><p>UNIVERSITY; AND MOHAMED MAHDI AKEF, FORMER HEAD OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC CENTER IN MUNICH. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  DR. ESSAM EL ARIAN, ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL OF </p><p>THE PHYSICIANS\' SYNDICATE REPRESENTS THE YOUNGER, DOVE </p><p>GENERATION OF LEADERS.  ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS GROUP ARE SEIF </p><p>EL ISLAM EL BANNA, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE LAWYERS\' </p><p>SYNDICATE AND SON OF THE MB FOUNDER;  IBRAHIM EL ZAAFARANI </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PHYSICIANS\' SYNDICATE IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p>AND SALAH ABDEL MAQSOUD OF THE JOURNALISTS SYNDICATE. </p><p>POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR IMED SHAHEEN BELIEVES THE YOUNGER </p><p>GENERATION HAS A "NEW VISION."  BRED ON THE CAMPUSES, THEY </p><p>ARE "POLITICIANS" RATHER THAN "REVOLUTIONARIES."   ZAAFARANI </p><p>TOLD POLOFF LAST FALL THAT THE MB DOES NOT CONDONE VIOLENCE </p><p>AND HE INDICATED HE WANTED TO OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH THE U.S. </p><p>ESSAM EL ARIAN EXPLAINED TO AL AHRAM IN OCTOBER 2000, "... </p><p>THE BROTHERHOOD WAS NEVER INVOLVED IN ANY ACT OF VIOLENCE </p><p>(NOTE: PRESUMABLY, IN HIS EXPERIENCE)... WHEN (THEY) WERE PUT </p><p>ON TRIAL, THEY WERE NEVER ACCUSED OF USING VIOLENCE... WE ARE </p><p>AGAINST ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE..." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>SECRECY AND SUCCESSION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) ASKED ABOUT CONCRETE PLANS FOR SUCCESSION TO AVOID A </p><p>POWER VACUUM, EL ARIAN TOLD AL AHRAM NEWSPAPER, "ALL MATTERS </p><p>ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE (MB) SHURA COUNCIL." </p><p>ACCORDING TO STATUTES SET BY ITS FOUNDER IN 1928 AND </p><p>REPORTEDLY AMENDED IN 1992, A CANDIDATE FOR THE POST OF </p><p>SUPREME GUIDE MUST BE FROM THE 120-MEMBER SHURA COUNCIL.  MB </p><p>CHAPTERS OUTSIDE EGYPT WILL ALSO HAVE A SAY IN SELECTING THE </p><p>NEW LEADER, ACCORDING TO ARIAN.  SPECIFICS AND CRITERIA FOR </p><p>CHOOSING A NEW LEADER ARE NOT CLEAR.  MB SPOKESMAN EL HODEIBI </p><p>ADMITTED TO AL AHRAM IN MARCH THAT, "CONVENING THE (SHURA) </p><p>COUNCIL WOULD IN ITSELF LEAD TO ARREST."  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONSIDERS MEMBERSHIP IN THE MB SHURA COUNCIL A CRIMINAL </p><p>MATTER, ACCORDING TO MB SOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) DUE TO THE MB CODE OF SECRECY CONCERNING ITS </p><p>DELIBERATIONS AND PLANS AS WELL AS EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT ANGST </p><p>WITH MB ELECTORAL ACTIVITIES AND RECENT GAINS BOTH IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT AND THE LAWYERS\' SYNDICATE, MB MEMBERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>HESITANT TO SPEAK WITH EMBASSY OFFICERS ABOUT THE MB.  WE </p><p>HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE LIKELY SUCCESSOR TO MUSTAFA </p><p>MESHHOUR, NOW 80 YEARS OLD.  GIVEN THE ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>STRUCTURE AND SPLIT WITHIN THE POLITICAL CAMPS, SELECTION OF </p><p>THE NEXT SUPREME GUIDE WILL LIKELY REPRESENT A STRUGGLE </p><p>BETWEEN THE HAWKS AND THE DOVES.  GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT </p><p>WHO IS ACTUALLY ON THE SHURA COUNCIL, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHICH </p><p>SIDE IS LIKELY TO WIN, ALTHOUGH ACADEMICS FAMILIAR WITH THE </p><p>MB INDICATE MESHHOUR\'S SUCCESSOR WILL LIKELY COME FROM THE </p><p>"DOVE" GENERATION. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) DESPITE ITS INTERNAL CHALLENGES, THE SPECTER OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE, AND ARREST OF ITS MEMBERS, THE MB </p><p>ENJOYS A DEGREE OF POLITICAL POPULARITY AMONG EGYPTIANS, </p><p>WHICH WE WILL EXAMINE IN THE SECOND CABLE IN THIS SERIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KURTZER </p><p></p></div>
