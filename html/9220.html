<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001368 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION U. S. POLICY TOWARDS ZIM UNDER </p><p>FIRE; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "U. S. taking out carrot and stick once </p><p>      again" the July 3 edition of the independent daily "The </p><p>      Daily News" carried an op-ed by Kuthula Matshazi on page 8 </p><p>      that was critical of the United States policy towards </p><p>      Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The carrot-and-stick principle that Powell </p><p>      proposes is very ludicrous and derogatory to a </p><p>      people\'s status.  It assumes that money is the fixer </p><p>      of everything.  Never.  And Bush and Powell know </p><p>      that too.  You can\'t buy us so cheap, Bush and </p><p>      Powell.  Sure, there are problems in Zimbabwe, but I </p><p>      do not think that we need America to come and </p><p>      interfere in our affairs.  As events and time have </p><p>      shown, only the power of the people can solve the </p><p>      problems of Zimbabwe.  Not American money and </p><p>      politics. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
