<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 TEGUCIGALPA 000626 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA DAS FISK, WHA/CEN, AND WHA/EPSC </p><p>STATE FOR PM, INL, EB, AND CA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, OVIP, PGOV, SNAR, ETRD, ECON, MOPS, KJUS, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: TRANSFORMING CENTRAL AMERICA,S SECURITY PARADIGM: </p><p>NEW MISSIONS, MORE APPROPRIATE WEAPONS, BUT LINGERING </p><p>DOUBTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer, Reasons 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  President Maduro reiterated his personal </p><p>commitment to regional disarmament and expressed his </p><p>willingness to move forward on this issue. He also asked for </p><p>U.S. support, mentioning directly the possible need for a </p><p>multilateral security guarantee and asked whether the U.S. </p><p>could provide transition assistance for demobilized soldiers. </p><p>Western Hemisphere Affairs (WHA) Deputy Assistant Secretary </p><p>(DAS) Dan Fisk informed Maduro that the U.S. does not see </p><p>threats to any Central American country coming from their </p><p>regional neighbors.  Fisk commented that he had delivered </p><p>similar messages in San Salvador and Managua over the last </p><p>month and said that the U.S. wanted to understand how </p><p>Honduras was restructuring to meet the new threats to </p><p>national and international security.  He encouraged Maduro to </p><p>take bold steps to rationalize the region\'s military forces. </p><p>Fisk stressed that better regional security relationships </p><p>would help Central American countries realize the full </p><p>benefits of a Central American integration, including a </p><p>Central American Free Trade agreement with the United States. </p><p> END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. Interest In Regional Security </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During WHA DAS Dan Fisk\'s February 5-8 visit he </p><p>discussed Central American disarmament efforts, regional </p><p>military arrangements, and ongoing border disputes with </p><p>President Ricardo Maduro, Minister of Defense Frederico </p><p>"Fred" Breve, and Foreign Minister Guillermo Perez-Cadalso </p><p>Arias.  DAS Fisk conveyed the U.S. view that  Honduras had </p><p>nothing to fear from its two neighbors, El Salvador and </p><p>Nicaragua.  He added further that the U.S. does not see </p><p>threats to any Central American country coming from their </p><p>regional neighbors, commenting  that he had delivered similar </p><p>messages in San Salvador and Managua over the last month.  He </p><p>said the U.S. welcomed the Honduran perspective on regional </p><p>security issues and was interested in understanding how </p><p>Honduras is  restructuring its military to meet the new </p><p>threats to national and international security.  He </p><p>encouraged President Maduro to take bold steps to rationalize </p><p>Honduras\' military and to pursue similar initiatives </p><p>regarding a new regional security framework.  He </p><p>underscored to the Hondurans that better regional security </p><p>relationships would help the region realize the full benefits </p><p>of  Central American integration, including a U.S-Central </p><p>America Free Trade agreement. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Maduro Still Willing To Pursue Disarmament </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) President Maduro reiterated his personal commitment to </p><p>regional disarmament during his February 7 meeting with WHA </p><p>DAS Fisk.  He told Fisk that he wants to reduce the amount of </p><p>money spent on weapons in Honduras.  Maduro emphasized that </p><p>he is willing to move forward on this issue and that his </p><p>government has a proposal to do so. (COMMENT: We are not </p><p>aware of, and doubt there is, any concrete proposal prepared </p><p>by the Government of Honduras (GOH) at this time. END </p><p>COMMENT.)   Noting that the militaries in El Salvador and </p><p>Honduras were more subordinate to civilian authority than </p><p>were those in Guatemala and Nicaragua, he commented that his </p><p>fellow Central American presidents have favorably received </p><p>his suggestions on this topic.  However, Maduro asked for </p><p>U.S. support, mentioning directly the possible need for a </p><p>multilateral security guarantee and whether the U.S. could </p><p>provide economic assistance for demobilized soldiers to be </p><p>integrated into local economies. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) DAS Fisk said Washington recognized President Maduro\'s </p><p>leadership and reiterated the U.S. assessment that most of </p><p>the weapons in Central American military inventories </p><p>represented a Cold War security frame of reference and are </p><p>not the most effective means to  address current threats.  He </p><p>urged President Maduro to take advantage of this historic </p><p>moment and the good will of his fellow presidents to </p><p>rearrange Central American security arrangements in a manner </p><p>that addressed the current threats.  Fisk also urged Maduro </p><p>to consider a dramatic gesture to seize the moral authority </p><p>to lead this process.  He then suggested that Honduras\' F-5 </p><p>aircraft did not enhance Honduras\' ability to confront these </p><p>new emerging security threats and that the costs of the </p><p>logistical support for them crowded out other more pressing </p><p>Honduran military needs.  Fisk continued by saying that the </p><p>Bush Administration was willing to engage on this issue, </p><p>including noting, for example, that the idea had been raised </p><p>of U.S. engagement through such regional mechanisms as the </p><p>Central American Armed Forces Conference (CFAC).  He also </p><p>offered his view that whichever Central American country took </p><p>the first concrete steps towards transforming its </p><p>security/military framework would be in a strong position to </p><p>define the process for the region and would bring positive </p><p>attention to its actions from Washington. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>MOD Outlines New Regional Military Missions </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In DAS Fisk\'s first meeting in Honduras on February 6, </p><p>Defense Minister Fred Breve said that his country\'s and the </p><p>region\'s military are preparing themselves for the new </p><p>transnational threats to their sovereignty and that his </p><p>President, Ricardo Maduro, is ready to pursue regional </p><p>disarmament in order to better align the types of weapons and </p><p>size of the region\'s militaries to these new threats.  As an </p><p>example, Breve pointed to the Central American Armed Forces </p><p>Conference (CFAC) declaration in December that calls on the </p><p>Central American militaries to prepare a common plan to </p><p>combat terrorism.  In addition to this recognition of new </p><p>threats, Breve said that CFAC is also working to downgrade </p><p>their concern about the old threats (i.e. invasion by one </p><p>country in the region against the other).  He said CFAC knows </p><p>it must now unify in order to act against the new common </p><p>enemy.  As an important first step, the CFAC agreed to new </p><p>intelligence sharing on organized crime, with specific </p><p>cooperation in the areas of d </p><p>rug trafficking, narcoterrorism, and Arab alien smuggling. </p><p>Breve also added that the countries agreed to work toward </p><p>establishing a "true" regional inter-agency military </p><p>taskforce. (COMMENT: He did not elaborate on what its mission </p><p>would be. END COMMENT.)  He admitted it will take the </p><p>countries time to identify first the units for the force and </p><p>then the resources to support it. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Breve specifically stated that, given his reduced </p><p>military budget, regionalization of Central American military </p><p>efforts presented an opportunity for more effective use of </p><p>the limited resources available.  He assured Fisk that the </p><p>Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) were aware that it was a </p><p>different world.  Breve wants the HOAF to participate in the </p><p>CFAC counterterrorism unit.  He added that the HOAF mindset </p><p>was changing, noting  that he was reorienting Honduran forces </p><p>to the new missions by reducing the number of bases and </p><p>battalions and deploying forces in the prime drug trafficking </p><p>areas of the North Coast.  The Maduro administration also has </p><p>involved the HOAF in the effort to combat the growing crime </p><p>problem in Honduras and the military itself was more involved </p><p>with the community via civic action, responding to natural </p><p>disasters, and helping to address health programs.  He </p><p>assured Fisk that Honduras was adapting to the new threat </p><p>environment. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Fisk responded that the U.S. wanted Honduras to think </p><p>about new missions in exactly this way.  He told Breve that </p><p>CFAC was the right mechanism to pursue this kind of </p><p>regionalization of militaries and informed the Minister that </p><p>the idea of U.S. engagement, through the U.S. Southern </p><p>Command, with CFAC had recently been raised.   Fisk made </p><p>specific reference to the expanded HOAF engagement in the </p><p>counternarcotics effort and expressed Washington\'s </p><p>appreciation. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Breve said he saw military regionalization as directly </p><p>linked to greater regional economic integration.  However, he </p><p>said Honduras felt there were still some considerable </p><p>challenges to overcome.  He cited the glacial progress toward </p><p>actual land border demarcation with El Salvador and the </p><p>continuing Nicaraguan tariff as impediments.  He cautioned </p><p>that Presidential-level commitments to integration were not </p><p>being translated into action.  He also voiced concern about </p><p>Salvadoran small arms and military transport acquisitions and </p><p>renewed U.S. interest in military-to-military relations with </p><p>Nicaragua, which he imagined would eventually include new </p><p>U.S. military equipment.  Noting the smaller size of the </p><p>Honduras armed forces, he opined that the Honduran Air Force </p><p>provided equilibrium for the Hondurans, even while he </p><p>acknowledged at the same time that the Air Force\'s F-5s were </p><p>more of a symbolic, rather than an effective, deterrent </p><p>force. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Fisk, noting that he had met two days before with the </p><p>Salvadoran MOD, said it is the U.S. conclusion that El </p><p>Salvador\'s military sees its missions being in such areas  as </p><p>humanitarian/disaster response, and also that it wants to </p><p>cooperate with its neighbors.  Its defense modernization is </p><p>designed to help it move troops to respond to these new </p><p>missions.  He said he was impressed with the Salvadoran </p><p>military\'s professionalization and added that he did not see </p><p>any evidence of  expansionist tendencies. After reassuring </p><p>Breve about U.S. views and efforts on the Nicaraguan tariff, </p><p>Fisk agreed that the U.S. has sought a new relationship with </p><p>the Nicaraguan military.  He told Breve that the U.S. effort </p><p>was very respectful of Nicaraguan civilian authority over the </p><p>military and our support would be primarily in logistical </p><p>areas and designed to help transform the Nicaraguan armed </p><p>forces to meet their new missions. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>MOD Views Disarmament Favorably But Asks For U.S. Help </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) Fisk called Breve\'s attention to Nicaraguan Foreign </p><p>Minister Norman Caldera\'s statement on weapons  at the OAS </p><p>counterterrorism meeting in El Salvador two weeks earlier. </p><p>He characterized it as very forward learning and stated that </p><p>the U.S. supported Caldera and the GON efforts to control its </p><p>weapon inventories, including surface-to-air missiles.  Breve </p><p>felt that Caldera\'s statement had been made in response to </p><p>OAS pressure regarding Nicaraguan arms smuggling to </p><p>terrorists in Colombia.  Fisk then stated that there was </p><p>interest and enthusiasm in the U.S. for disarmament </p><p>initiatives emanating from the region.  He commented that any </p><p>such effort would have to take into account defense needs to </p><p>protect against  new threats  and the resources needed to </p><p>address them.  He told Breve that the U.S. was looking to the </p><p>region\'s leaders to grasp this opportunity and that </p><p>leadership would be needed on these issues.  Fisk underscored </p><p>that the U.S. was open to Central American ideas on this </p><p>issue and needed the regio </p><p>n to let us know where it wanted to go on this issue so that </p><p>the U.S. could engage.  He noted that all sides had weapons </p><p>that did not meet their needs against the current threats </p><p>that they confront. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Breve outlined talks between President Maduro and </p><p>Salvadoran President Francisco Flores on disarmament.  He </p><p>said the two had agreed and presented the issue to their </p><p>fellow Central American presidents.  The two presidents were </p><p>working on how to present such ideas to their militaries. </p><p>Breve said that initial discussions also had identified broad </p><p>regional concern about the need to address the implications </p><p>of the demobilization of forces.  The leaders felt that such </p><p>decommissioned forces would represent a target of opportunity </p><p>for organized crime.  Without some sort of jobs program, </p><p>organized crime could use its resources to recruit </p><p>well-trained military to support their ends. Breve affirmed </p><p>Honduran willingness to start a disarmament process but he </p><p>believed it would be a long process.  As much as he would </p><p>like to see early agreement, Breve\'s honest assessment is </p><p>that it will take some time.  He noted that all sides may </p><p>have the intent but may not be willing to act. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Fisk said that he understood the historical </p><p>challenges confronting the region and that demobilization was </p><p>a real concern.  He said the U.S. did not seek to minimize </p><p>the challenges but hoped for a start in the short term.  He </p><p>urged that all sides consider bold steps.  He stressed that </p><p>whomever "gambled" first would have the moral high ground and </p><p>could use it to move the others.  He suggested that another </p><p>way to approach the issue was to view it as a rationalization </p><p>of arms inventories rather than disarmament of militaries. </p><p>He highlighted that the U.S. goal was a better framework for </p><p>overall regional security.  Breve thanked Fisk for this </p><p>encouragement and closed by mentioning the need to consider a </p><p>multilateral security guarantee or body with oversight </p><p>authority. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Foreign Minister Concerned About El Salvador and Nicaragua </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>13. (C) In DAS Fisk\'s meeting with Foreign Minister </p><p>Perez-Cadalso later in the day, the FM reiterated Honduran </p><p>concerns and suspicions about its neighbors\' intentions. </p><p>(COMMENT: Interestingly, MOD Breve made a similar comment, </p><p>saying that suspicions would continue to exist in the </p><p>short-term. END COMMENT.)  Two issues stood out:  Honduran </p><p>concern about Nicaragua\'s 35 per cent tariff and deep </p><p>frustration over the slow, practically non-existent pace of </p><p>land border demarcation with El Salvador.  Perez-Cadalso </p><p>stated that both problems were frustrating to the GOH because </p><p>Presidential-level agreements were not being followed through </p><p>on at the working level by its neighbors.  However, in both </p><p>cases, Perez-Cadalso affirmed that these were issues that </p><p>needed to be put behind the countries because the leaders </p><p>shared the same vision of the future. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) FM Perez-Cadalso stressed that the GOH was prepared </p><p>to accept an ICJ ruling on its maritime border with </p><p>Nicaragua, but that the tariff threatened to start a trade </p><p>war between the two countries.  He noted that the Maduro </p><p>government had been patiently waiting for some action for </p><p>more than a year.  He warned that the Honduran Congress was </p><p>considering taking action because many in Tegucigalpa were </p><p>skeptical that the Nicaraguan Congress really planned to act. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Perez-Cadalso was equally frustrated about the land </p><p>border demarcation with El Salvador.  He said that it was now </p><p>more than 10 years since the ICJ ruling and there had been </p><p>very little progress in actually marking the border as called </p><p>for in the ruling.  He commented that many Hondurans believe </p><p>that El Salvador is simply stalling.  He told DAS Fisk that </p><p>Honduras was prepared to accept a technical expert (an </p><p>independent third party, preferably an American engineer) who </p><p>could settle disputes on the spot.  Perez-Cadalso said that </p><p>the GOH was prepared to accept such an arrangement in order </p><p>to make progress. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
