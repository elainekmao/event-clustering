(SBU) SUMMARY:  This cable contains the final draft </p><p>of the donors statement of principles regarding </p><p>provision of foreign assistance to Sri Lanka as the </p><p>peace process proceeds.  This text has been agreed to </p><p>(ad referendum) by all of Sri Lanka\'s major donors at a </p><p>meeting at Ambassador Wills\' residence April 23.  The </p><p>meeting produced relatively minor changes to the text </p><p>drafted the week before and reported in Reftels.  The </p><p>meeting addressed the manner in which the statement of </p><p>principles will be presented.  In light of the Tigers\' </p><p>April 21 announcement withdrawing from the next round of </p><p>talks and the Tokyo conference, donors agreed to defer </p><p>the decision about how to present the statement to the </p><p>negotiating parties until the status of peace talks is </p><p>resolved.  The donors would look for advice from the </p><p>Norwegians as to the timing of the release.  Ambassador </p><p>Wills suggested a meeting of the donors after the talks </p><p>reconvene to reassess the situation.  The group also </p><p>discussed a common press posture, should the document </p><p>become public.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The principal donors to Sri Lanka reconvened </p><p>April 23 at Jefferson House to discuss proposed </p><p>revisions by capitals to the text agreed to the previous </p><p>week and reported in Ref (B). The meeting produced minor </p><p>revisions to the text itself (see Para.7).  The most </p><p>significant revision to the text was a reordering and </p><p>modification of the priorities contained in the last </p><p>section of the paper and the annex.  Where priority </p><p>milestones in the text were repeated in the annex, they </p><p>have been removed from the annex.  (NOTE: The annex </p><p>cannot be sent in cable form and will follow by fax). </p><p>Much of the afternoon\'s discussion centered on what to </p><p>do with the paper following the announcement by the LTTE </p><p>on April 21 to suspend peace talks (Ref C).  Ambassador </p><p>Wills proposed waiting until the resumption of talks, </p><p>and to look for advice from the Norwegians as to the </p><p>timing of the release to both parties.  The Japanese </p><p>Ambassador concurred, calling for the co-chairs of the </p><p>June Tokyo conference to review the situation, and </p><p>reformulate their strategy with the Norwegians and the </p><p>group of donors.  He stressed Tokyo\'s desire to keep the </p><p>document confidential.  All the donors agreed that it </p><p>was likely that the document would be leaked, and </p><p>discussed a common press posture should the document </p><p>become public. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) One specific change was the on the U.S.- </p><p>proposed language concerning child soldiers in the </p><p>"Reconciliation" section near the end of the paper.  The </p><p>donors modified the language proposed by L concerning </p><p>international law; the bullet point now reads "Underage </p><p>recruitment:  complete halt to recruitment of </p><p>individuals under age 18; progress on the reintegration </p><p>and provision of education and training to current and </p><p>former underage recruits."  The other donors felt L\'s </p><p>language was too legalistic- imagine that! ?d thus out </p><p>of keeping with the tone of that section otherwise.  We </p><p>trust Washington will concur with the new language. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The donors agreed to consult capitals on the </p><p>new text as well as guidance on distribution, with </p><p>Ambassador Wills calling for a meeting once peace </p><p>negotiations resume. </p><p>7.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Request Washington agencies\' </p><p>comments/concurrence on the text in para 7. </p><p> </p><p>Statement of Principles </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Following is the revised statement of </p><p>principles as agreed upon during the April 22 meeting. </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>DRAFT April 23, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Basic Principles for Peace and Development </p><p> </p><p>1.  Purpose </p><p>To ensure sustainable resources for peace and </p><p>development in Sri Lanka through a process that links </p><p>development assistance to adherence to basic principles. </p><p>This is not intended to prescribe but rather to take </p><p>forward the dialogue and partnership among GOSL, LTTE </p><p>and donors, on shared concerns. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Background and Rationale </p><p>Sri Lanka is in a period of transition, somewhere </p><p>between war and peace but not yet definitively \'post </p><p>conflict.\' Progress towards peace and political </p><p>settlement must be encouraged and supported by all </p><p>parties. </p><p> </p><p>This paper highlights basic agreed principles and </p><p>suggests milestones that link development assistance to </p><p>the peace process. The milestones relate to development </p><p>assistance, not humanitarian aid. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka can boast significant progress towards peace. </p><p>The ceasefire agreement has held for more than one year, </p><p>regular peace negotiations have demonstrated commitment </p><p>to address core issues such as a political settlement, </p><p>human rights, humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance </p><p>and gender.  Development achievements are also </p><p>noteworthy:  SIHRN has been established and acknowledged </p><p>by the international community; NERF is operational; </p><p>quick impact projects are being approved; the paper, </p><p>"Regaining Sri Lanka," along with a multilateral group- </p><p>supported assessment for immediate and medium term </p><p>rehabilitation needs, will be tabled at a pledging </p><p>conference in Tokyo in June 2003. </p><p> </p><p>The peace process and the development process are </p><p>mutually reinforcing.  There is need, therefore, to </p><p>develop procedures for ensuring they complement each </p><p>other. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Basic Principles </p><p> </p><p>3.1 Progress on Political settlement </p><p>The main message of the Oslo Declaration is that a </p><p>viable political settlement should be the desired </p><p>outcome of the peace process.  Through six rounds of </p><p>talks, progress and commitments have been made on </p><p>substantive issues.  At the Hakone talks, the parties to </p><p>the negotiation reiterated their commitment to develop a </p><p>federal system based on internal self-determination </p><p>within a united Sri Lanka.  This paper recognises that </p><p>this process will take time, and aims to enhance this </p><p>positive momentum. </p><p> </p><p>3.2 Respect for human rights and security </p><p>Human security is central to the post conflict peace </p><p>settlement process.  It encompasses freedom for </p><p>civilians from pervasive threats, ensures their </p><p>protection and safety, and promotes respect for human </p><p>rights by all parties. </p><p>The Hakone peace talks expressed the parties\' commitment </p><p>to respect and uphold human rights.  We encourage </p><p>expeditious development and implementation of the human </p><p>rights roadmap.  There has also been ongoing substantive </p><p>dialogue between the LTTE and a coalition of </p><p>organisations led by UNICEF on child rights and children </p><p>affected by war. </p><p> </p><p>Considerable commitments were made during 2002 regarding </p><p>land tenure and access issues in conflict-affected </p><p>areas, and on the rights of IDPs.  These positive </p><p>initiatives now require support and implementation. </p><p>Adoption of the UN Guiding Principles on Internal </p><p>Displacement would support these initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>3.3 Participation and Representation </p><p>The Oslo Declaration and SIHRN\'s Guiding Principles </p><p>underscore the importance of recognising the needs and </p><p>aspirations of all ethnic communities as well as </p><p>actively involving beneficiaries of development </p><p>assistance in planning their own development. </p><p> </p><p>At present, ordinary Sri Lankans need a better </p><p>understanding of the peace process.  Wider public </p><p>knowledge and dialogue on the negotiations would </p><p>strengthen public support for peace. </p><p> </p><p>Keys to effective engagement with international actors </p><p>on development, investment and trade will be </p><p>establishing pluralistic, representative government and </p><p>open, market-oriented economies in conflict-affected </p><p>areas. In the latter connection, the donors call on the </p><p>parties to adopt economic policies aimed at reducing </p><p>poverty and encouraging private sector activity. </p><p> </p><p>3.4 Democracy </p><p>The donors accept that it is for the parties to </p><p>negotiate constitutional arrangements with which the </p><p>country as a whole will be comfortable.  The donors\' </p><p>concern is that the system must be democratic, </p><p>transparent and accountable. </p><p> </p><p>There is overwhelming support for a greater degree of </p><p>autonomy at local levels, with representative </p><p>decentralised local government that is accountable, </p><p>responsive to local needs, makes better use of available </p><p>local resources and delivers efficient services. </p><p>While this transition will take time, developing and </p><p>strengthening local government structures expeditiously </p><p>will help build trust within and between communities and </p><p>create an enabling environment for increased donor </p><p>support.  The Hakone proposal to prepare for local </p><p>government elections in the North and East is a welcome </p><p>initiative. </p><p> </p><p>3.5 Transparency and Management of Finances </p><p>With additional resources being committed in the </p><p>conflict-affected areas, the open and transparent </p><p>management of these resources would increase community </p><p>and donor confidence.  While the guidelines for SIHRN </p><p>and the NERF are positive steps, the lack of clarity </p><p>over systems of revenue generation, resource </p><p>distribution and taxation in conflict-affected areas </p><p>needs to be resolved.  The donors urge the parties, in </p><p>the management of public finance and development </p><p>assistance, to combat waste, fraud, and all other </p><p>corrupt practices. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Reconciliation </p><p>Ultimately, the goal of the peace process will be </p><p>reconciliation between and among communities island- </p><p>wide. This will require the underlying causes of </p><p>tensions between and amongst communities island-wide to </p><p>be addressed and reconciled.  National frameworks such </p><p>as that for Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconciliation </p><p>(3R) make important recommendations which address both </p><p>equity and access imbalances in Sri Lanka.  Issues such </p><p>as language policy, education and public sector reform </p><p>require immediate action, additional resources and </p><p>unwavering political commitment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Milestones </p><p>The success of the framework will depend on the setting </p><p>of realistic and achievable milestones.  The immediate </p><p>priorities include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Full implementation and strengthening of the </p><p>ceasefire agreement, including unrestricted access by </p><p>the SLMM. </p><p> </p><p>-- Adoption of the "plan" leading to a final political </p><p>settlement. </p><p> </p><p>-- Clarification of the respective roles of central and </p><p>local government in the administration of taxation and </p><p>the management of public funds. </p><p> </p><p>-- Development of structures of governance at the </p><p>devolved level that are representative, transparent and </p><p>accountable. </p><p> </p><p>-- Underage recruitment: complete halt to recruitment of </p><p>individuals under age 18; progress on the reintegration </p><p>and provision of education and training to current and </p><p>former underage recruits. </p><p> </p><p>-- Respect for basic operating principles of </p><p>international humanitarian and development assistance </p><p>agencies. </p><p> </p><p>-- Progress on settlement of land and livelihood issues </p><p>on occupied lands, including in the HSZ. </p><p> </p><p>-- No laying of new mines and increased mine clearance. </p><p> </p><p>As the peace process progresses, there will need to be </p><p>dialogue to establish further milestones in emerging </p><p>areas such as security and related matters. </p><p> </p><p>Annex 1 contains sample, illustrative milestones in </p><p>support of the above principles. </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>9.
