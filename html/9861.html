<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 004831 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, SOCI, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: CPA SENIOR HEALTH ADVISOR HAVEMAN\'S VISIT TO AMMAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified; please protect accordingly </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Summary:  CPA Senior Health Sector Advisor Jim </p><p>Haveman and a team of CPA staff visited Amman July 28-29 on a </p><p>fact-finding and appeal tour.  During meetings with an array </p><p>of local and international groups, Haveman described current </p><p>conditions in the Iraqi health sector, elicited outside views </p><p>on progress being made in Iraq, and made a pitch for material </p><p>and technical assistance.  CPA has already made enormous </p><p>strides in getting the health sector up and running again, </p><p>but used this trip to identify a number of remaining critical </p><p>needs for which they are requesting assistance from the donor </p><p>community, governments, and the private sector.  The GOJ has </p><p>already begun to consider some of these needs and could be a </p><p>natural conduit for rebuilding Iraq\'s health sector.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT\'S THERE </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  The health sector currently consists of:  One </p><p>11-story MoH building; approximately 240 public hospitals; 70 </p><p>private hospitals; 5 hospitals that were previously the </p><p>private reserves of Saddam Hussein and family; 1,200 primary </p><p>care clinics; 13 medical schools.  The sector employs 85,000 </p><p>people, including MoH personnel and health care </p><p>professionals.  The sector has 29,000 hospital beds, half of </p><p>them empty. </p><p> </p><p>CURRENT CONDITIONS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  According to Haveman, all 11 stories of the MoH </p><p>building were completely gutted by looters, down to the </p><p>switchplates and electrical wiring in the building.  Power </p><p>supply to the country\'s hospitals is sporadic, and roughly </p><p>50% of the medical equipment country-wide is not working. </p><p>Resources tend to be concentrated in and around Baghdad, with </p><p>significantly lower levels of supply and infrastructure in </p><p>the south and in the north.  For example, Haveman noted that </p><p>3 million northern Kurds share 3 MRI machines, and have not </p><p>had access to basic painkillers like Demerol in over 14 years. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Medical capabilities in the country are relatively </p><p>strong, with a healthy supply of qualified physicians and </p><p>pharmacists.  However, lack of access to information over the </p><p>past two-plus decades has put the medical community well </p><p>behind the curve on modern techniques and therapies.  Nursing </p><p>care is substandard, with nurses serving more as orderlies </p><p>than as medical caregivers. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Management capabilities throughout the country are </p><p>virtually non-existent.  Decades of oppression have stifled </p><p>initiative, and much of the sector, as elsewhere in the </p><p>country, is ruled by fear or reprisal for any independent </p><p>thought.  Furthermore, the completely centralized nature of </p><p>the sector under Saddam meant that only the MoH had </p><p>administrative authority, leaving doctors in charge of local </p><p>hospital administration.  The system currently has no </p><p>hospital administrators as such. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  The CPA MoH budget stands at $210 million for H2 </p><p>2003, exclusive of salaries.  This compares favorably to the </p><p>$16 million Saddam spent in all of 2002 to provide health </p><p>care for 23 million people.  Within the CPA budget, $30 </p><p>million has been earmarked for procurement of generators for </p><p>hospitals, and another $125 million for </p><p>purchasing/procurement of critically needed supplies (in </p><p>addition to funds provided through the OFF program). </p><p> </p><p>WHAT THEY\'VE DONE </p><p> </p><p>7.  (u)  Haveman\'s overarching goal is to decentralize the </p><p>healthcare system and devolve as much responsibility as </p><p>possible to the local level.  In conjunction with that, he is </p><p>working to overhaul the MoH and bring supplies and services </p><p>to communities that need them most.  Since the war ended, CPA </p><p>has: </p><p> </p><p>-- delivered humanitarian supplies to critical needs areas, </p><p>including 3,500 tons of medical supplies in the past 45 days. </p><p> </p><p>-- returned medical service levels to near or better than </p><p>pre-war levels:  in the Kurdish north, service levels are at </p><p>100%-plus of pre-war levels; in Basra and the south, service </p><p>is at 85% of pre-war; and in Baghdad and central Iraq, </p><p>service levels are at 75% of pre-war. </p><p> </p><p>-- restructured wages for health care professionals.  Doctors </p><p>now earn $160-$260 per month (vice $20/month under Saddam), </p><p>and pharmacists have seen their wages increase substantially </p><p>from the $1/month they earned under the old regime. </p><p>-- Purged the upper reaches of the MoH of Baathist </p><p>leadership, removing 10 senior MoH officials. </p><p> </p><p>-- held the first country-wide meeting of provincial hospital </p><p>managers in 40 years. </p><p> </p><p>-- held the first country-wide nurses\' seminar in recent </p><p>memory. </p><p> </p><p>-- launched the "Adopt-a-hospital" program, which seeks to </p><p>identify sponsors from the international public or private </p><p>sector who will refurbish, repair, and supply one of the 30 </p><p>hospitals designated by CPA has having the most critical </p><p>needs. </p><p>-- began prioritizing O-F-F contracts to ensure delivery of </p><p>the most critically needed supplies.  CPA staff have </p><p>categorized outstanding approved and funded contracts into </p><p>four tiers, with tier one being the most critically needed </p><p>supplies.  The top 50 tier one contracts were submitted to </p><p>the UN on July 24, and notification to ship should go out to </p><p>contractors by August 7.  Tier 2 contracts will be notified </p><p>by end September; tier 3 by end October; and tier 4 (no </p><p>priority) by November 21, when OFF terminates.  In addition, </p><p>CPA is prioritizing approved but NOT funded contracts to see </p><p>which if any contain critically needed supplies.  Those that </p><p>do will be considered for filling from CPA\'s $125 million </p><p>procurement budget.  Lower priority unfunded OFF contracts </p><p>may be considered at a later date, depending on how needs </p><p>develop.  Contracts with Iraq under programs other than OFF </p><p>(e.g., the Jordan-Iraq oil and trade protocol) are not </p><p>currently being prioritized by CPA. </p><p> </p><p>-- began plans to identify a "tiger team" of some 200 </p><p>engineers and repair specialists already in Iraq to conduct a </p><p>rapid assessment and repair of inoperable medical equipment. </p><p>That which can be fixed easily will be, that which is </p><p>irreparable will be discarded, that which requires additional </p><p>repair will be identified.  Announcement of this team may be </p><p>made in as little as two weeks. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT THEY NEED - MATERIAL </p><p> </p><p>8.  (u)  CPA is developing a "wish list" of critical needs </p><p>and of longer term needs for bringing the MoH and the sector </p><p>up to international norms.  Broadly speaking, outstanding </p><p>needs can be broken down into two categories:  material </p><p>needs, and technical assistance needs. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (u)  Iraq is critically short of "tier one" drugs, i.e. </p><p>high-quality pharmaceuticals and life-saving and more </p><p>specialized drugs.  The Kimadia warehouse is awash in drugs </p><p>purchased under OFF during the Saddam regime, but many of </p><p>those drugs were purchased for purely political reasons and </p><p>either do not work, are not safe, or were never intended for </p><p>delivery.  CPA made a plea to multinational pharmaceutical </p><p>company regional representatives for a commitment to donate </p><p>and/or contract quality drugs on a long-term commitment </p><p>basis, to ensure a continuous supply. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (u)  The country is also in critically short supply of </p><p>basic medical supplies and equipment, and is seeking </p><p>donations from the private sector and donor community to </p><p>supplement current stocks.  CPA is also preparing a specific </p><p>needs list for presentation to the planned UN donors\' </p><p>conference in October.  Haveman mentioned in particular a </p><p>shortage of proper hospital beds, noting all the beds in the </p><p>system date from the mid-1980\'s.  On a related note, he said </p><p>bedsheets and blankets are virtually nonexistent. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (u)  The Ministry itself, and hospital administrative </p><p>offices, are in need of basic office supplies - desks, </p><p>chairs, wastebaskets, calculators, and the like.  CPA would </p><p>welcome donations of such equipment.  Haveman was quick to </p><p>note, though, that MoH is not yet prepared to accept IT </p><p>equipment, as they have not planned out an IT strategy which, </p><p>he noted, would have to be compatible with other government </p><p>ministries and with the network of hospitals and clinics. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (u)  The healthcare system also needs updated medical </p><p>textbooks, journals, and other recent medical literature, </p><p>including on CD-ROM, both to supply medical schools and to </p><p>bring practicing healthcare providers up to speed on current </p><p>practices.  Finally, the system is in short supply of </p><p>medical-grade oxygen.  CPA has indicated a desire either for </p><p>a steady supply of such oxygen or, even better, investment in </p><p>existing or new oxygen manufacturing plants to provide oxygen </p><p>to hospitals on a commercial basis. </p><p>WHAT THEY NEED - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p>13.  (u)  While material needs are the most critical </p><p>currently, CPA has noted a number of areas where technical </p><p>assistance would be welcome in the medium-to-long term. </p><p>These areas include, but are not likely limited to, finding </p><p>adoptive "parents" for the Adopt-a-Hospital program, </p><p>providing training/skills upgrades for Iraqi pharmacists, </p><p>repairing medical equipment not covered by the "tiger team," </p><p>skills training for nurses, legislative and regulatory </p><p>assistance to develop a streamlined registration/licensing </p><p>regime, development of certification programs and exams for </p><p>local healthcare providers, and training for EMT\'s/first </p><p>responders. </p><p>FOLLOW-UP FROM JORDAN </p><p>14.  (sbu)  During Haveman\'s meetings in Amman, both the </p><p>private sector and the GOJ expressed eagerness to help meet </p><p>critical needs wherever possible.  CPA staff noted that </p><p>virtually all of the OFF contracts that Jordanian suppliers </p><p>inquired about had been prioritized as "tier one," indicating </p><p>that many outstanding approved/funded Jordanian contracts </p><p>would be settled expeditiously.  They further noted that, </p><p>among the approved but NOT funded contracts, many Jordanian </p><p>contracts would probably fall into areas deemed "critical </p><p>needs."  In addition to contract-based support, Jordan </p><p>offered the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- a group of local doctors has offered to establish a </p><p>working group to provide training, teaching, and - to the </p><p>extent possible - medical literature to Iraqi counterparts. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Jordanian Armed Forces have a field hospital currently </p><p>operating in Iraq.  CPA has asked the GOJ to consider folding </p><p>it into the Adopt-a-Hospital program, in an effort to </p><p>eliminate the possibility of a parallel healthcare system </p><p>choking off development of the sector.  The Embassy ad the </p><p>GOJ will begin discussing this proposal next week. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Jordanian MoH is providing CPA with copies of all </p><p>healthcare-related legislation and regulatory frameworks </p><p>developed since Jordan acceded to the WTO.  In particular, </p><p>they have offered to assist CPA develop regulations for a </p><p>new, transparent and efficient drug registration regime. </p><p> </p><p>-- Jordan\'s MoH also offered to include Iraqi enrollment in </p><p>its newly-founded nursing center. </p><p> </p><p>-- On a broader level, GOJ Planning Minister Bassem Awadallah </p><p>has pledged the GOJ\'s full support for any future CPA MoH </p><p>needs, noting that a stable, prosperous Iraq is in Jordan\'s </p><p>best interest.  Haveman told Awadallah he would try to put </p><p>together a specific "wish list" to highlight areas where </p><p>Jordan might help. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (u)  CPA Senior Advisor Haveman did not have the </p><p>opportunity to clear this message. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (u)  Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
