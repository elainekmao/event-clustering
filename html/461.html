<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KHARTOUM 02937 </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p>E.O.: 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, LY, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  BASHIR\'S SECOND ANNIVERSARY SPEECH:  HOT </p><p>          AIR IN THE DESERT </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  THE HIGHLIGHT OF CELEBRATIONS </p><p>(VASTLY SCALED DOWN) FOR THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL SALVATION REVOLUTION WAS RCC CHAIRMAN </p><p>BASHIR\'S SPEECH JUNE 29 AT FRIENDSHIP HALL.  IN </p><p>ATTENDANCE WERE LIBYAN LEADER QHADDAFI AND CHADIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT IDRIS DEBY (THE ONLY HEADS OF STATE PRESENT </p><p>THIS YEAR) AS WELL AS SOME LOWER-LEVEL YEMENI, SOMALI </p><p>AND ERITREAN DELEGATIONS.  BASHIR\'S SPEECH WAS </p><p>LARGELY SELF-CONGRATULATORY AND PEPPERED WITH THE </p><p>EXPECTED DIGS AT THE FORMER POLITICAL PARTIES, THE </p><p>OPPOSITION IN EXILE AND THE SOUTHERN REBELS.  ONE </p><p>UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT WAS THE GOS\' INTENT TO </p><p>DEMOLISH KHOBAR PRISON IN A SYMBOLIC GESTURE OF </p><p>SUDAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (LOU)  SUBSTITUTING FOR THE LARGE </p><p>MILITARY/CIVILIAN PARADE STAGED LAST YEAR WAS A </p><p>"GLORIOUS CELEBRATION" HELD IN THE COURTYARD OF </p><p>FRIENDSHIP HALL, AT WHICH PRESIDENT BASHIR DELIVERED </p><p>HIS SPEECH ON THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>SALVATION REVOLUTION.  ALL CHIEFS OF MISSION, INVITED </p><p>FOR 1830 HOURS, WERE SEATED IN A LONG ROW OF CHAIRS </p><p>IN FRONT OF A PACKED MASS OF STANDING "POPULAR </p><p>FORCES" WHO APPEARED TO BE ALMOST ENTIRELY NIF </p><p>MEMBERS AND POPULAR DEFENSE FORCES (PDF) IN UNIFORM. </p><p>ASSEMBLED THERE ALMOST TWO HOURS EARLIER, THEY WERE </p><p>PRESSED TIGHTLY AGAINST THE SEATED DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>AND SWEATING PROFUSELY.  SINCE THE DEMONSTRATION WAS </p><p>LIMITED TO THE FENCED-IN FRONT COURTYARD OF THE HALL, </p><p>THE CROWD NUMBERED ONLY ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND, WITH </p><p>POSSIBLY TWO THOUSAND MORE LINGERING OUTSIDE THE </p><p>FENCE.  DESPITE REPEATED EFFORTS TO AROUSE THE CROWD </p><p>WITH SLOGANS SHOUTED OVER LARGE LOUDSPEAKERS, IT </p><p>REMAINED LISTLESS AND UNRESPONSIVE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  AT ABOUT 2000 HOURS, GOS MILITARY AND </p><p>CIVILIAN OFFICIALS AND SCORES OF SPECIAL GUESTS </p><p>EMERGED FROM THE AIR-CONDITIONED FRIENDSHIP HALL </p><p>WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SOCIALIZING AND ENJOYING </p><p>REFRESHMENTS, WHILE CHIEFS OF MISSION SWELTERED </p><p>OUTSIDE FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.  A LARGE CONTINGENT </p><p>OF HEAVILY-ARMED LIBYAN BODYGUARDS ALSO APPEARED AND </p><p>SEALED OFF THE STEPS LEADING UP TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE </p><p>WHERE THE INVITED WERE SEATED. </p><p> </p><p>DOMESTIC HIGHLIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  IN HIS SPEECH, BASHIR MADE ALL THE EXPECTED </p><p>NOISES ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE JUNE 30 REVOLUTION </p><p>(EVEN ONE NIF INSIDER SNIFFED TO POLOFF THAT THE </p><p>SO-CALLED REVOLUTION SHOULD BE MORE APTLY DESIGNATED </p><p>THE "COUP D\'ETAT").  BASHIR HAILED ADVANCES MADE BY </p><p>THE GOS IN HEALTH, AGRICULTURE, ECONOMIC LAWS AND </p><p>PUBLIC EDUCATION.  HE ALSO PRAISED THE GOS\' EFFORTS </p><p>TO INTRODUCE SHARIA\', TO APPLY THE FEDERAL SYSTEM, </p><p>AND TO MOUNT NATIONAL DIALOGUE CONFERENCES TO "BOOST </p><p>SHURA" (I.E. CONSULTATION). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  THESE AND OTHER CHANGES, BASHIR SAID, HAVE </p><p>FREED SUDAN "FROM THE CAPTIVITY OF POWER-SEEKING </p><p>TRADITIONAL FORCES AND DEFIED THE EXTERNAL CIRCLES </p><p>HARBORING AMBITIONS IN SUDAN."  BASHIR CLAIMED THAT </p><p>THE "FOREIGN-BACKED OPPOSITION" HAD "DISINTEGRATED" </p><p>AND THE REBELLION MOVEMENT HAD "SHRUNK."  THEREFORE, </p><p>IT WAS NOT NECESSSARY FOR THE GOS TO RESORT TO </p><p>EMERGENCY MEASURES.  HE CALLED ON OTHER NATIONS TO </p><p>FOLLOW SUDAN\'S EXAMPLE IN RELEASING POLITICAL </p><p>PRISONERS, A DECISION MADE, HE SAID, IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>APPEALS BY "ARAB AND MOSLEM BROTHERS AND IN </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH...ISLAMIC SHARIA."  BASHIR RENEWED </p><p>THE GOS AMNESTY FOR ALL WHO "OPPOSED OR CARRIED ARMS </p><p>AGAINST" THE COUNTRY BUT GAVE NO APPLICABLE DATES. </p><p>NOT SATISFIED WITH THE EARLIER RELEASE OF POLITICAL </p><p>PRISONERS, BASHIR ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT 1300 CONVICTS </p><p>WOULD BE FREED FROM PRISON.  THESE CONVICTS ARE TO BE </p><p>LARGELY MADE UP OF ELDERLY PERSONS AND YOUTHS WHO </p><p>HAVE SERVED MOST OF THEIR SENTENCE (INELIGIBLE, AMONG </p><p>OTHERS, ARE THOSE IMPRISONED UNDER THE STATE SECURITY </p><p>ACT). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  BASHIR ACKNOWLEDGED THE HARDSHIPS BEING </p><p>ENDURED BY THE SUDANESE POPULATION BUT NOTED THAT </p><p>THEY WERE THE NECESSARY RESULT OF NEEDED ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORMS.  HE ALSO REITERATED THAT THE "BASES" OF THE </p><p>NEW POLITICAL SYSTEM WOULD BE LAID DOWN SOON BUT GAVE </p><p>NO OTHER DETAILS. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARENA </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  ON FOREIGN POLICY, BASHIR SAID SUDAN "WAS </p><p>ABLE TO AFFECT THE OCCURENCE OF EVENTS AND TO MAKE </p><p>THE WORLD CONSIDER ITS VIEWPOINTS" IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FORA.  HE NOTED THAT SUDAN HAD "STOOD AGAINST THE </p><p>IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT AND ALSO AGAINST THE </p><p>DEVASTATION OF IRAQ."  HE DEMANDED THAT THE ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE WORK TOWARDS LIFTING SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ. </p><p>BASHIR DESCRIBED THE SUDANESE-LIBYAN INTEGRATION AS </p><p>SUDAN\'S "OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT" IN ITS RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE ARAB WORLD.  THE INTEGRATION, HE CLAIMED, </p><p>HAD "PRODUCED VARIOUS SUCCESSES" FOR THE SUDANESE AND </p><p>LIBYAN PEOPLES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  BASHIR ALSO SAID SUDAN WANTED TO ENHANCE ITS </p><p>RELATIONS WITH ALL WESTERN, EUROPEAN AND EASTERN </p><p>COUNTRIES.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE CALLED ON AFRICAN </p><p>STATES TO INCREASE COOPERATION AMONGST THEMSELVES, IN </p><p>PART TO AVERT FOREIGN INFLUENCE AND DETER COLONIALIST </p><p>INTERVENTIONS.  HE AGAIN URGED THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO ETHIOPIAN REFUGEES IN </p><p>SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>KHOBAR </p><p> </p><p>9.  BASHIR\'S MOST SURPRISING STATEMENT, HOWEVER, WAS </p><p>HIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE GOS\' INTENT TO DESTROY KHOBER </p><p>PRISON IN KHARTOUM NORTH.  THE DESTRUCTION, TO OCCUR </p><p>JULY 1, IS INTENDED TO SHOW SUDAN\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS.  (COMMENT:  BASHIR\'S SELECTION OF THIS </p><p>PRISON IS A STRANGE ONE.  OF ALL OF SUDAN\'S JAILS, </p><p>KHOBER IS CONSIDERED THE MOST COMFORTABLE.  MANY </p><p>FORMER KHOBAR DETAINEES HAVE FAVORABLY CONTRASTED </p><p>THEIR ACCOMODATIONS IN KHOBAR TO THE CONDITIONS IN </p><p>OTHER PRISONS -- SHALLA FOR EXAMPLE -- OR IN "GHOST </p><p>HOUSES."  TALK IN KHARTOUM IS THAT THE GOS WANTS THE </p><p>DESIRABLE REAL ESTATE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT INTO PRICEY HOMES FOR THE ELITE.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>THE LIBYANS </p><p> </p><p>10.  (LOU)  THE LIBYANS IN ATTENDANCE INCLUDED SOME </p><p>OF QHADDAFI\'S FEMALE BODYGUARDS DRESSED IN TIGHT </p><p>FIGHTING DESIGNER JEANS AND SPIKED HEELS AND PACKING </p><p>PISTOLS UNDER THEIR LOOSE FITTING JUMPER TOPS.  THIS </p><p>MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT SHOCKING TO THE ASSEMBLED </p><p>ALL-MALE ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS WHO HEAVILY ROBE AND </p><p>COVER UP FEMALE MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (LOU)  THE APPEARANCE OF POSTERS PICTURING </p><p>COLONEL QHADDAFI  AND CHANTS OF "WAFI WAFI YA </p><p>QADDHAFI (FAITHFUL QADDHAFI) MADE IT APPARENT THAT </p><p>THE BROTHER LEADERS WOULD NOT ONLY APPEAR BUT WOULD </p><p>BE HONORED AND ADULATED AT THE CEREMONY AND WOULD </p><p>LIKELY ADDRESS THE CROWD, DISPENSING HIS USUAL </p><p>INVECTIVE AGAINST THE U.S. AND THE WEST.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>CHEEK AND BRITISH AMBASSADOR RAMSAY THEREFORE </p><p>DEPARTED FROM THE PREMISES FOLLOWING THE APPEARANCE </p><p>OF QHADDAFI AND THE PLAYING OF SUDAN\'S NATIONAL </p><p>ANTHEM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
