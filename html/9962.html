<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001347 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, KDEM, ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEMONSTRATION AT EMBASSY; ATTACK ON </p><p>OPPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B & D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  About 50 men and women assembled at </p><p>the Embassy on July 3 to peacefully protest the April </p><p>elections and the visit of the President Bush to see </p><p>President Obasanjo.  After departing peacefully, at </p><p>least 30 of the demonstrators were detained for about </p><p>ten days, we learned.  While the demonstrators\' </p><p>organization is unknown to Embassy, regime officials </p><p>believe that it was sponsored by the ANPP and its </p><p>presidential candidate.  More people were detained </p><p>when police officials rounded up staff at the </p><p>Buhari/Okadigbo campaign headquarters on July 7.  At </p><p>least two of the demonstrators contend they were </p><p>physically abused while in detention.  A judge ordered </p><p>the detainees freed on July 15 and they were released </p><p>on July 16.  Also on July 16, a gang of ten armed men </p><p>attacked the ANPP headquarters in Abuja, ransacked its </p><p>offices, removed files and set fire to the building. </p><p>While the demonstrators\' organization is unknown to </p><p>Embassy, regime officials believe that it was </p><p>sponsored by the ANPP and its presidential candidate. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  About 50 men and women came to Embassy Abuja </p><p>the morning of July 3 to protest irregularities in the </p><p>recent elections and the upcoming visit of President </p><p>Bush.  Other participants were reportedly turned away </p><p>by police already on alert due to the general strike </p><p>against the fuel price increase.  The representatives </p><p>of the "Concerned Youth Alliance of Nigeria," a </p><p>heretofore unknown group, presented a statement to </p><p>Embassy staff.  The communique said that the Obasanjo </p><p>government "lacks legitimacy" and listed the various </p><p>deficiencies in the elections and the subsequent </p><p>electoral tribunal process.  The statement says that a </p><p>"visit by the U.S. President . . . will amount to a </p><p>show of solidarity and support for an illegitimate </p><p>government," and requests that, if the visit must take </p><p>place, an audience be granted to the Nigerian youth, </p><p>"the most cheated aggrieved, marginalized and </p><p>disenfranchised."  Apparently, roughly 30 of the </p><p>demonstrators were arrested after they had departed </p><p>the area around the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  At least two of the detainees claim to have </p><p>been beaten while in custody.  They claim that they </p><p>were physically coerced to name accomplices and that </p><p>the police attempted to secure confessions from them </p><p>implicating the ANPP and its presidential candidate, </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari.  According to a source who has </p><p>interviewed one of the detainees, the Inspector </p><p>General of Police Tafa Balogun personally told </p><p>officers to "squeeze them hard." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  On July 7, police in Abuja entered the </p><p>campaign headquarters of the Buhari/Okadigbo </p><p>organization and arrested the office staff.  Two </p><p>campaign officials and several party supporters were </p><p>detained on suspicion of organizing the July 3 </p><p>protest.  According to the Campaign spokesman, the </p><p>police attempted to "force confessions" from the </p><p>detainees and claimed that at least three officials </p><p>were hospitalized after being interrogated and </p><p>allegedly beaten.  According to a police contact, at </p><p>least four officials from the headquarters are still </p><p>in detention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  On July 15, an Abuja Magistrate Court ordered </p><p>the police to release 31 people detained after the </p><p>July 3 demonstration for "unlawful assembly, criminal </p><p>conspiracy and inciting disturbance."  Justice Bala </p><p>Haruna asked the police to describe what constituted </p><p>"unlawful assembly."  Rather than respond, the police </p><p>dropped the charges.  The Justice ruled that the </p><p>demonstrators "acted within the provisions of the </p><p>Nigerian Constitution" and ordered the release of the </p><p>detainees.  It appears that the 31 detainees were </p><p>released the following day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THUGS ENTER ANPP HEADQUARTERS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  On July 16, ten armed men forcibly entered </p><p>ANPP party headquarters, stabbing one employee in the </p><p>process.  According to one witness, the men went to </p><p>the offices of the party chairman and secretary, </p><p>removed files, doused the rooms with "a flammable </p><p>liquid," and set it ablaze before fleeing.  The FCT </p><p>fire service and the police did not respond. </p><p>Volunteers from the Nigeria National Petroleum </p><p>Council\'s private fire brigade came to contain the </p><p>blaze after the attackers fled.  Several offices were </p><p>gutted.  According to one party insider, documents for </p><p>the ANPP\'s July 17 presidential tribunal session were </p><p>among the files pilfered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COMMENT:  The organization purportedly behind </p><p>the demonstration at the Chancery is previously </p><p>unknown to us, but it is common in Nigeria to gather a </p><p>group of "protesters" from the large pool of </p><p>unemployed youth in the country.  In arresting the </p><p>protesters, the security forces overreacted.  The </p><p>protesters were peaceful; this time, it was the police </p><p>who misbehaved.  With the fuel strike in full swing </p><p>and with the security anxiety surrounding the POTUS </p><p>visit, the police were probably instructed to staunch </p><p>any signs of protests.  It was likely felt that this </p><p>small protest was a harbinger of other protests </p><p>intended, at the very least, to embarrass the GON </p><p>politically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT CONT.:  Security forces predictably </p><p>concluded that the ANPP was behind the protest. </p><p>However, detention of Buhari campaign workers was </p><p>equally indefensible and troubling.  For now, we </p><p>cannot identify the architects of the arson at the </p><p>ANPP headquarters or the motivation for this crime. </p><p>The culprits could be internal or external to the </p><p>party.  However, these incidents, viewed collectively, </p><p>demonstrate that political tension, far from </p><p>dissipating, is still significant and can be rekindled </p><p>quickly.  The heavy-handed actions of the GON security </p><p>arms indicate an attempt to nip political protests in </p><p>the bud before they gather momentum.  Should this </p><p>become standard police practice, not only are we </p><p>likely to see more detentions and arrests of </p><p>opposition figures in the future, but Nigeria is </p><p>likely to experience an increase in its political </p><p>temperature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
