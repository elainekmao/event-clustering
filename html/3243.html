<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001576 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT  -- G8 SUMMIT AND NEPAD </p><p> </p><p>1. Under headline "G8 summit a damp squib for NEPAD\'s </p><p>  lofty goals," the independent daily "The Daily </p><p>  News" dedicated its July 3 editorial to stating </p><p>  that the G8\'s proposed aid package to Africa falls </p><p>  short of expectations.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.  ". . .The Group of Eight (G8) summit paid more </p><p>   attention to the Russians and their problems.  To </p><p>   be sure, they did pledge to give Africa some aid, </p><p>   but it was far, far less than what had been </p><p>   promised earlier.  Vladimir Putin left the summit </p><p>   with a smile as broad as the Volga River on his </p><p>   face while the four African leaders invited to the </p><p>   summit must have left the Canadian Rockies feeling </p><p>   as barren in their hopes for the future as the </p><p>   Sahara Desert.  They had been invited to the </p><p>   summit because of their starring roles in the New </p><p>   Partnership for Africa\'s Development (NEPAD). </p><p>   What the rich nations eventually undertook to do </p><p>   may go a long way in improving living standards on </p><p>   the continent.  Individually, the rich countries </p><p>   pledged to increase their aid to Africa, to cancel </p><p>   the crippling debts of the poorest countries and </p><p>   generally to boost trade between themselves and </p><p>   the continent.  But none of this was enough to </p><p>   satisfy critics of the G8 leaders who felt they </p><p>   had fallen far short of their earlier promises. </p><p>   For NEPAD and its lofty goals, the summit was </p><p>   truly a damp squib. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
