(SBU) Summary.  On April 2, the Honduran Congress </p><p>considered and adopted in one reading a second fiscal </p><p>package (the first was adopted in May 2002) designed to </p><p>broaden the tax base, help reduce chronic budget deficits </p><p>and move the government on the road to an IMF agreement. </p><p>Congress modified several of the government-proposed </p><p>provisions in order to lessen the impact on low and medium </p><p>income Hondurans (the majority) and to avoid political </p><p>backfire from influential unionized public sector workers </p><p>(particularly teachers).  Increased taxes on tobacco and </p><p>alcohol were added in order to compensate for lost revenues. </p><p>The government and the IMF are working together to develop </p><p>projections of the effect of the final tax proposals on the </p><p>government\'s annual revenues.  The target had been an annual </p><p>increase of 3.5 billion lempiras, (USD 200 million) - of </p><p>which about 2 billion lempiras (USD 118 million) would be </p><p>collected in the remaining months of 2003 - but IMF sources </p><p>are concerned that the final result will be lower.  The GOH </p><p>has continued with its planned austerity measures and work </p><p>to strengthen the financial sector.  The most problematic </p><p>issue remains: getting the public sector wage bill under </p><p>control for the medium and long term.  The GOH is engaged in </p><p>negotiations with striking doctors on a needed change to the </p><p>law on mandated salaries for medical personnel (if </p><p>successful, the "estatuto" for teachers will be tackled </p><p>next).  The GOH also continues to promise to introduce a new </p><p>civil service framework law that provides the GOH with </p><p>control over wage policy for the majority of public sector </p><p>workers.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) After two months of negotiation and fine-tuning, </p><p>the Honduran government submitted to Congress a package of </p><p>tax measures (called the Law of Tax Equity) designed to </p><p>broaden the tax base and eliminate a number of special tax </p><p>exemptions.  To ease its quick passage, the bill had already </p><p>been watered down from an initial proposal discussed with </p><p>the IMF, but Congress modified it further during the </p><p>marathon legislative session on April 2.  The key measures </p><p>include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Reduction of the income tax exemption for bonuses and </p><p>representation expenses for individuals with income above </p><p>600,000 lempiras (USD 35,294) annually.  Taxation of </p><p>insurance premiums paid by companies and executives. </p><p>Application of the income tax to capital gains from the sale </p><p>of securities and property.  Application of the income tax </p><p>to rental income (for executives and professionals).  The </p><p>first 90,000 lempiras (USD 5,294) will be exempt from income </p><p>tax. </p><p> </p><p>-- Application of the income tax to the "14th month" salary </p><p>(a bonus paid to employees in June of each year) and other </p><p>benefits such as vacation, for taxpayers with annual income </p><p>greater than 225,000 lempiras (USD 13,235).   The "13th </p><p>month" Christmas bonus remains exempt from income tax. </p><p> </p><p>-- Corporate income tax was unified at a rate of 25 percent </p><p>of net taxable income. </p><p> </p><p>-- A "temporary solidarity tax" of five percent was </p><p>established for corporate taxpayers with taxable income </p><p>greater than one million lempiras (USD 58,824).  It will be </p><p>applied to tax bills for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 tax years. </p><p>Hotels and companies working under special export regimes </p><p>are exempted from this measure. </p><p> </p><p>-- Tobacco products and alcoholic beverages will be subject </p><p>to a 15 percent sales tax.  An internal tax on cigarettes </p><p>was increased from 32.25 percent to 45 percent, aligning  it </p><p>with practice in the rest of Central America.  The </p><p>calculation of sales tax on beer, soft drinks and alcoholic </p><p>beverages was modified. </p><p> </p><p>-- Establishment of withholding taxes to ensure more </p><p>corporate taxpayer compliance.  The law requires a payment </p><p>of 12.5 percent of wholesale transactions that will be </p><p>applied against corporate income tax bills.  Similarly, </p><p>companies and self-employed individuals will pay withholding </p><p>taxes of 2.5 percent of net taxable income. </p><p> </p><p>-- Elimination of tax exemptions for nongovernmental </p><p>organizations, cooperatives, churches and nonprofit </p><p>organizations.  Exemptions remain for activities by NGOs </p><p>related to health, education and charity.  Rules on the </p><p>exemptions from customs duties on automobiles imported by </p><p>NGOs are also tightened up.  These provisions are designed </p><p>to stop tax avoidance by Honduran companies.  USAID is in </p><p>discussions with the GOH on the need to avoid taxing U.S. </p><p>assistance provided through NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>-- The number of products exempt from sales tax was reduced </p><p>from 800 to about 200 (mostly foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, </p><p>books and publications and school supplies). </p><p> </p><p>-- Creation of a one percent tax on the value of net assets </p><p>for companies involved in wholesale or retail trade. </p><p> </p><p>-- Elimination of the tax exemption for fuels used in the </p><p>generation of electricity.  Power generation firms may </p><p>present their invoices to the state-owned electricity </p><p>company ENEE for reimbursement of these taxes and customs </p><p>duties.  (Note: this measure was taken to control widespread </p><p>abuses of the tax exemption, in which bunker and diesel fuel </p><p>were imported supposedly for power generation but in fact </p><p>sold on the market.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Reinstatement of the ten percent consumption tax on cars </p><p>including "luxury pickups". </p><p> </p><p>-- Tightening up of the rules on free trade zones and </p><p>special warehouses.  Only true export operations will be </p><p>eligible for related tax breaks. </p><p> </p><p>-- Tightening up of methods to measure inventory and </p><p>corporate expenses routinely deducted to calculate net </p><p>taxable corporate income. </p><p> </p><p>-- Procedural changes to improve sales and income tax </p><p>compliance, including the control of receipts, electronic </p><p>filing and channeling payments through credit card </p><p>companies. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The fiscal package also contained the following </p><p>expenditure measures: </p><p> </p><p>-- Cancellation of 60 percent of government positions that </p><p>were vacant on December 31, except in education, health and </p><p>security.  Overtime pay is limited. </p><p> </p><p>-- Wage freeze for public employees not covered by </p><p>collective bargaining agreements. </p><p> </p><p>-- Instruction to proceed with retirement for all employees </p><p>not meeting legal requirements (generally age). </p><p> </p><p>-- Austerity measures such as limitation of monthly use of </p><p>cellular phones by public officials and establishment of </p><p>caps on overtime hours. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The IMF is working with the GOH to develop </p><p>projections of the effect of the final tax proposals on the </p><p>government\'s annual revenues.  The target had been an annual </p><p>increase of 3.5 billion lempiras (USD 200 million) - of </p><p>which about 2 billion lempiras (USD 118 million) would be </p><p>collected in the remaining months of 2003 - but IMF sources </p><p>are concerned that the final result could be significantly </p><p>lower.  The Congress rejected three important tax measures </p><p>in the original government proposal: taxation of the </p><p>Christmas and June bonuses for a much larger group of </p><p>taxpayers; elimination of the exemption from income tax for </p><p>secondary school teachers and university professors (primary </p><p>teachers have a tax exemption written into the </p><p>Constitution), and taxation of electricity for the largest </p><p>residential users and for commercial users.  The increase in </p><p>the sales tax for tobacco and alcohol was added to </p><p>compensate for these cutbacks. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The GOH has continued with its planned austerity </p><p>measures and work to strengthen the financial sector.  The </p><p>most problematic issue remains: getting the public sector </p><p>wage bill under control.  The GOH is currently in </p><p>negotiations with the doctors over changes to the special </p><p>law, or estatuto, which governs pay for medical personnel. </p><p>GOH negotiators have distributed results of their analysis </p><p>of the Honduran medical establishment\'s comparability with </p><p>other countries in the region.  By any measure, Honduran </p><p>doctors are the highest paid in the region, while medical </p><p>indicators for the country are some of the worst in Latin </p><p>America.  The result of the negotiation (which has the </p><p>possibility of turning into a labor confrontation and a </p><p>doctor\'s strike) will set the stage for attacking the </p><p>bigger, although not quite as egregious, problem of the </p><p>growth in the wage bill for teachers.  (See ref A for more </p><p>on the GOH\'s dispute with the doctors.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: From the IMF\'s point of view, the fiscal </p><p>package was watered down from the original proposal, bowing </p><p>unduly to political pressure.  The Fund is concerned that </p><p>(1) teachers and other unionized public sector workers will </p><p>continue as privileged groups, and (2) widespread tax </p><p>exemptions distorting the economy and reducing potential tax </p><p>income will continue.  To the GOH\'s credit, however, the </p><p>fiscal measures do attack some notable tax loopholes that </p><p>have allowed Honduran companies and wealthy individuals to </p><p>pay very little in taxes over the years.  The question </p><p>remains to be answered if the measures will deliver the </p><p>hoped-for tax revenues.  President Maduro has requested a </p><p>meeting with the Managing Director of the IMF  during his </p><p>April 9-11 visit to Washington to review the progress made </p><p>to date.  Embassy is tracking the progress of GOH-IMF </p><p>negotiations closely.  If no agreement is reached, Honduras </p><p>will need to pay certain overdue payments on DOD loans by </p><p>July and September of this year or risk triggering Brooke </p><p>Amendment sanctions.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
