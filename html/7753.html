<p>UNCLAS ACCRA 000835 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS OPIC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ENRG, GH, ENIV </p><p>SUBJECT: VALCO SHUTS DOWN LAST POTLINE </p><p> </p><p>1. David Thomas, the Managing Director of Volta Aluminum </p><p>Company Limited (VALCO), contacted Econoff to announce VALCO </p><p>will voluntarily curtail its one operating potline effective </p><p>May 5. The company took the decision, according to Thomas, in </p><p>light of the current 237.80 foot level of Volta Lake. Given </p><p>this level, said Thomas, the Volta River Authority (VRA), </p><p>which provides hydropower from Akosombo Dam to VALCO, would </p><p>probably have to curtail VALCO\'s power supplies in the coming </p><p>weeks, using force majeure. According to Thomas, the </p><p>curtailment by VALCO will provide the VRA with some </p><p>flexibility in powering the rest of the electrical grid. </p><p>Under its contract, according to Thomas, VALCO will reserve </p><p>the right to obtain power later in the year when the lake has </p><p>somewhat recovered. VALCO sees minimal impact on its current </p><p>workforce and hopes to resume operations later this year. </p><p>VALCO hopes this gesture is seen as a good faith effort to </p><p>assist Ghana during this power crisis. </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
