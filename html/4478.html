(SBU) SUMMARY: For more than seventy years, the Arab Bank </p><p>has been among the most respected, and even beloved, </p><p>financial institutions in the region.  Having weathered wars, </p><p>political and economic unrest, closures, and </p><p>nationalizations, the Bank has grown into a regional and </p><p>global player in the banking sector, with a reputation as a </p><p>transparent, competent, and trustworthy banker and lender. </p><p>The Bank\'s Palestinian roots, connections, and reputation of </p><p>dependability have made it the preferred bank for </p><p>Palestinians worldwide.  Due to its stature, as well as to </p><p>the historical relationship between the founding Shoman </p><p>family and the monarchy, the Arab Bank enjoys an esteemed </p><p>place in Jordanian society, economically, politically, and </p><p>socially, and has become the "rock" of financial institutions </p><p>in Jordan--a "go to" place when times are tough, and a </p><p>symbol, to Palestinians and Jordanians alike, of the </p><p>"indomitable" Arab spirit.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Arab Bank Group (ARBK) is one of the largest </p><p>financial institutions in the Arab world, with over 400 </p><p>branches and offices in 30 countries in Asia, Europe, and the </p><p>Americas.  It comprises Arab Bank plc, Arab Bank Switzerland, </p><p>and a number of other subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide, </p><p>including branches in New York, London, Paris, Australia, and </p><p>the Gulf countries.  According to its 2001 annual report, the </p><p>Bank had assets of $22.2 billion at the end of 2001.  The </p><p>company\'s net income for 2001 was $195 million, up 6.9% over </p><p>2000. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>THE BANK AND THE JORDANIAN ECONOMY </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Arab Bank branches in Jordan and the Occupied </p><p>Territories accounts for 22% of the Bank\'s assets and 21% of </p><p>its worldwide revenues.  According to Central Bank of Jordan </p><p>(CBJ) figures, the Bank holds 31% of assets, 37% of bank </p><p>deposits, and 17% of loans in the Jordanian banking system. </p><p>The company also accounts for 39% of the Amman Stock </p><p>Exchange\'s (ASE) market capitalization.  With its reputation </p><p>for probity, transparency, and sound management, the Bank has </p><p>been a cornerstone of the local economy, and, having survived </p><p>many political and economic crises in the region, is the </p><p>institution the Jordanian government and Arab clients look to </p><p>for reassurance when times get tough.  Following the </p><p>devaluation of the Jordanian dinar in the late 80s, the Bank </p><p>was one of the few legitimate sources of foreign currency in </p><p>Jordan.  In the wake of the al-Shemailah loan scandal </p><p>(REFTEL) earlier this year, it was rumored that the Bank </p><p>deposited sufficient funds at the CBJ in the event they were </p><p>needed to bail out troubled local banks directly affected by </p><p>the scandal.  Depositors withdrew funds from banks affected </p><p>by the scandal and deposited them in the Arab Bank. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Also noteworthy is the esteem in which the Bank </p><p>and its founding family, the Shomans, are held.  It is said </p><p>that, upon hearing of a threat on a leading Shoman\'s life by </p><p>a prominent southern tribe, the late King Hussein intervened </p><p>personally and told tribal elders directly that dire </p><p>consequences to the tribe would result should the threat be </p><p>carried out.  Another source told us that, when Lebanese PM </p><p>Rafiq Hariri attempted to purchase an additional 5% stake in </p><p>the Bank put up for sale by Kuwaiti interests, and the </p><p>resulting increased Hariri share posed a threat to Shoman </p><p>family control, King Abdullah personally weighed in with the </p><p>Kuwaitis on behalf of the Shomans to support a bid by the </p><p>Jordanian Social Security Corporation, which went on to </p><p>purchase the shares, and left the Bank in Jordanian hands. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Current Ownership and Control </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Shoman family continues to have putative </p><p>control over the Company through its reputation, the respect </p><p>and support of the majority of shareholders, and day-to-day </p><p>management of the Bank.  Currently, the family\'s stake is </p><p>down to 35%, according to market estimates.  Other major </p><p>holders are the Jordanian Social Security Corporation (SSC), </p><p>the Palestinian/Jordanian al-Masri, al-Sabbagh, and al-Saifi </p><p>families, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri (8%), and </p><p>the Saudi Government (17%) via various investment vehicles. </p><p>"Non-Arab" ownership of Arab Bank shares is limited, banned </p><p>as it was until the mid 90s by the Bank\'s internal bylaws due </p><p>to fears of Israeli influence. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The Shoman family also exerts a controlling </p><p>influence via the Board of Directors.  Out of the eleven </p><p>seats on the board, three are occupied by Shomans, two by the </p><p>al-Masri family, and one each by the Sabbagh family, the SSC, </p><p>a representative of the Saudi Ministry of Finance, the Jordan </p><p>Insurance Company, the Beirut-based Arabia Insurance Company, </p><p>and the al-Hariri family, all save the latter loyal to the </p><p>Shomans. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE WEST BANK/GAZA </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In the mid-nineties, the Bank received permission </p><p>by the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) and the Israeli Central </p><p>Bank to reopen in the West Bank/Gaza, under the supervision </p><p>of both the CBJ and the Palestinian Monetary Authority (PMA). </p><p> The Bank, which controls about 55% of total deposits in the </p><p>Occupied Territories, is said to be the main international </p><p>bank used by the Palestinian Authority (PA), although the PA </p><p>apparently prefers to use local, less transparent banks for </p><p>much of its domestic business.  The Arab Bank also owns 55% </p><p>of the Arab Palestine Investment Bank, and was the founding </p><p>shareholder in the Palestine Development and Investment </p><p>Company (PADICO), established in 1993 to help revitalize the </p><p>Palestinian economy.  However, the Bank has come under </p><p>increasing criticism locally as of late due to its extremely </p><p>conservative lending policy; it has virtually ceased lending </p><p>as a result of the Intifada and at a time when Palestinian </p><p>small and medium enterprises need assistance in rebuilding </p><p>and supporting their businesses. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Long identified with the Palestinian cause (Note: a </p><p>short biography of the founder of the Bank, Abdul-Hamid </p><p>Shoman, can be found on the intifada.com website under </p><p>Palestinian personalities), the Bank\'s employees, along with </p><p>then-CEO Abdul-Majid Shoman and the Bank\'s senior management, </p><p>donated 5% of one month\'s salary to the Palestinian people at </p><p>the outbreak of the al-Aqsa Intifada in October, 2000. </p><p>Abdul-Majid also established the Welfare Association, which </p><p>is, according to its website, is "the largest Palestinian </p><p>source of private funds directed toward humanitarian and </p><p>development efforts for Palestine".  The Bank\'s charitable </p><p>arm, the Amman-based Abdul-Hamid Shoman Foundation, sponsors </p><p>a number of Palestinian cultural, scientific, and literary </p><p>funds and fora. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  As one of the few financial outlets available to </p><p>Palestinians in the West Bank/Gaza, the Bank continues to be </p><p>a conduit for remittances from the United States and </p><p>elsewhere to the Occupied Territories.  The sums involved are </p><p>considerable in sum, but individual transactions are likely </p><p>small.  The PMA requires that transactions of more than </p><p>$10,000 be reported to the PMA, with a 24-hour hold on the </p><p>transaction while it is scrutinized.  According to a recent </p><p>U.S. news report, the FBI\'s Joint Terrorism Task Force is </p><p>investigating an Iraqi native indicted under Federal charges </p><p>of running an unlicensed business that illegally transferred </p><p>money to the Middle East.  The indictment alleges that Kareem </p><p>Abdalhassin Albasam used 11 accounts at four Utah banks to </p><p>transfer approximately $2 million to the Amman branch of the </p><p>Arab Bank, where an associate disbursed the money to others. </p><p>In addition, the IDF website (www.idf.il) contains a report </p><p>based on documents purportedly captured during the April </p><p>siege of the Muqatta that show that money from Saudi </p><p>charities was funneled to "families of notorious terrorists" </p><p>in the West Bank via Arab Bank branches.  None of these </p><p>reports suggests that Arab Bank management was aware of such </p><p>transactions. </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>AN ARAB BANK FOR ARABS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Founded by Abdul-Hamid Shoman as an "Arab bank </p><p>for Arabs", the Arab Bank opened its first branch in </p><p>Jerusalem in May 1930.  Its expansion began in 1934 with the </p><p>opening of a branch in Amman, and throughout the region in </p><p>the years following.  However, with the establishment of the </p><p>State of Israel in 1948, the Bank lost its branches in Haifa </p><p>and Jaffa, as well as most of the branches\' deposits. </p><p>Following the Six Day War in 1967, the Bank lost its West </p><p>Bank and Gaza branches. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) In the wake of these closures, the Bank </p><p>nonetheless honored its clients\' deposits both post-1948 as </p><p>well as after the Six Day War, despite not being indemnified </p><p>by the Israelis.  This commitment by the Bank to its </p><p>depositors has made it the bank most favored by Palestinians </p><p>worldwide.  Moreover, the closures caused resentment that </p><p>simmers to this day, and the Bank refuses to deal with Israel </p><p>or the Israeli government.  (Note: A wave of nationalizations </p><p>also took place in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Aden, and Sudan in the </p><p>Sixties and Seventies.  Syria and Iraq have yet to reimburse </p><p>the Bank for these takeovers.  In Saudi Arabia, the </p><p>Saudization of the Bank resulted in the establishment of the </p><p>Arab National Bank, in which the Arab Bank retains a 40% </p><p>share.  The Bank has never had branches in Iran.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE INDOMITABLE ARAB </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Shoman founded the Bank after spending 18 years in </p><p>the United States forging links with Arab communities there </p><p>and learning the retail and banking businesses.  He returned </p><p>to Palestine in 1929 to establish a bank that would "unite </p><p>Arab economies" and combat what he called "Zionist plans" to </p><p>take over the region.  Active in the Palestinian </p><p>demonstrations in 1936, he imported 20,000 pounds of rice and </p><p>sugar from Egypt to sell to Palestinians at token prices. </p><p>Charged with a number of offenses by British mandate </p><p>authorities, he served 18 months in a prison near Haifa. </p><p>Upon his release, Shoman returned to banking.  At the </p><p>outbreak of World War II, when a crowd of deposit holders </p><p>rushed the Jerusalem branch to withdraw their funds, Shoman </p><p>instructed all branches to honor such requests.  This action </p><p>restored confidence in the Bank.  Most funds were </p><p>redeposited, and the Bank acquired its reputation as a safe </p><p>haven, a reputation that still holds today.  In 1948, Shoman </p><p>moved to Amman along with the Bank\'s headquarters. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Shoman pushed the Bank\'s expansion as a way of </p><p>linking Arabs and Arab communities throughout the world. </p><p>Upon opening a branch in Zurich in 1962, the Bank became the </p><p>first Arab financial institution to establish a presence in </p><p>Switzerland.  With branches also in France, Germany, Italy, </p><p>Spain and the U.K., the Bank\'s European entities now comprise </p><p>the majority share of total assets, loans, deposits and </p><p>revenue.  The Bank also has branches in South America, China, </p><p>Korea, and the United States.  Supervised by a host of major </p><p>international regulators, the Bank, and the Shoman family, </p><p>have maintained an unsullied reputation within the </p><p>international banking community for transparency, regulatory </p><p>compliance, and faithful adherence to international banking </p><p>norms and standards. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>MANAGEMENT IN TRANSITION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) ARBK Chairman and son of founder Abdul-Hamid </p><p>Shoman, Abdul-Majid Shoman, transferred most of his formal </p><p>powers to his eldest son, Abdul-Hamid Shoman, now CEO, in </p><p>2001.  The younger Shoman is restructuring the Bank\'s </p><p>management team, much to the chagrin of the old guard, and it </p><p>has been said that he does not command respect in the way his </p><p>father and grandfather had.  The Bank is targeting its </p><p>recruiting efforts on graduates from Western universities, </p><p>and, as part of a new, accelerated management training </p><p>program, these new recruits will move into middle management </p><p>positions within four years, as opposed to ten years </p><p>previously, and this, too, may cause some morale problems. </p><p>In addition, in the recognition it must keep up with modern </p><p>banking, management, and technical advances, the Bank\'s </p><p>strategic plan includes the establishment of strategic </p><p>business units, human resource management, and IT </p><p>development.  The Bank\'s overall management has been </p><p>progressively decentralized, with the establishment of </p><p>regional management centers and branch managers gaining more </p><p>leeway on decision-making. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) As much a part of Jordanian history as any other </p><p>institution, civil or otherwise, the Arab Bank occupies an </p><p>important role in Jordan, commercially, financially, and </p><p>culturally, so much so that the Bank\'s stability plays a role </p><p>in the stability of the country and the region as a whole, as </p><p>recently expressed to us privately by the Governor of the </p><p>Central Bank.  Given the Arab Bank\'s reputation for </p><p>transparency and probity, and its financial bulk in the area, </p><p>allegations to the contrary would be most surprising, with </p><p>potentially far-reaching consequences for the Jordanian and </p><p>Palestinian banking systems, and ultimately, economies. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN CLEARED BY CONGEN JERUSALEM. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
