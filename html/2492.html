Regional Environment Office (REO) for South Asia, </p><p>based at Embassy Kathmandu, would like to propose several </p><p>projects for FY 02 and FY 03 funding via South Asia Bureau </p><p>regional Economic Support Funds (ESF).  While all of the </p><p>proposals have an environmental dimension, they are cross- </p><p>cutting, multi-purpose concepts that will contribute to </p><p>regional stability, confidence-building, and support other </p><p>important U.S. objectives in the region.  REO would like </p><p>to withdraw the FY 02 and 03 requests for USD 1 million </p><p>per year for an integrated river basin management and </p><p>flood forecasting proposal and substitute three new </p><p>proposals.  The total request for REO projects has been </p><p>revised downward slightly for FY02, to USD 1.2 million, </p><p>and sharply, to 1.3 million, for FY 03. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Projects have been listed in priority order, with </p><p>approximate amounts required for effective execution in </p><p>each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003.  Projects with an </p><p>asterisk are new proposals; others are ongoing initiatives </p><p>requiring continued funding already submitted through the </p><p>MPP and BPP processes. </p><p> </p><p>     Project                       FY02           FY03 </p><p> </p><p>(1) USGS Bengal Basin              250,000        350,000 </p><p>Groundwater Arsenic Research </p><p> </p><p>(2) Forests, People, Conflict      250,000        150,000 </p><p>and Insurgency* </p><p> </p><p>(3) SA Transboundary Water         150,000           - </p><p>Quality Monitoring Project </p><p> </p><p>(4) Environmental Crime*           250,000        250,000 </p><p>Anti-Trafficking Enforcement </p><p> </p><p>(5) Asian Water Quality            100,000        250,000 </p><p>Coalition* </p><p> </p><p>(6) Regional Environmental         200,000        300,000 </p><p>Governance Initiative              -------        ------- </p><p> </p><p>TOTAL:                           1,200,000      1,300,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Thumbnail descriptions of the initiatives follow </p><p>(complete project proposals to be furnished if needed): </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>USGS Bengal Basin Groundwater Arsenic Research </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>REO requests USD 250,000 in FY02 and 350,000 in FY03 to </p><p>fund continued research by the U.S. Geological Survey into </p><p>the causes of groundwater arsenic contamination in the </p><p>Bengal Basin.  This would complement, not/not duplicate or </p><p>replace the separate request for bilateral ESF by Embassy </p><p>Dhaka and our USAID mission to Bangladesh. (Note: The </p><p>World Bank has USD 37 million left in a USD 40 million </p><p>fund for arsenic research and mitigation in Bangladesh, </p><p>but the results of this research are needed to be able to </p><p>use the funds effectively.)  Regional funds would be used </p><p>to cover the cost of USGS participation in a multi-donor </p><p>effort to research the extent of the problem in Nepal\'s </p><p>Terai and investigate the mobilization pathways by which </p><p>the arsenic makes its way into the groundwater.  In </p><p>addition, it would fund travel to India, especially West </p><p>Bengal, for USGS consultations and collaborative research </p><p>with responsible Indian officials and groundwater experts. </p><p>(Coordination of research efforts between India and </p><p>Bangladesh to date has been poor.) </p><p> </p><p>Justification: Arsenic-contaminated groundwater has been </p><p>called - accurately, in our view - the greatest natural </p><p>disaster ever to strike mankind, affecting tens of </p><p>millions of people in the Bengal basin, including Nepal\'s </p><p>Terai.  The problem is not limited to South Asia, as </p><p>extensive contamination has been discovered in the </p><p>countries of the Mekong region, as well as in the U.S. </p><p>USGS has great credibility with all partners involved in </p><p>the arsenic question and, by common consensus, has the </p><p>greatest scientific capacity to address hydrogeological </p><p>and geochemical issues that need to be resolved.  Nepal </p><p>offers several comparative advantages for extending </p><p>research already underway: </p><p> </p><p>-- The contaminated aquifers are much closer to the </p><p>Himalayan source of the arsenic.  The simpler hydrogeology </p><p>(compared to the complicated stratography of the Gangetic </p><p>Delta) is more likely to yield early answers as to how the </p><p>arsenic gets into groundwater. </p><p> </p><p>-- The relatively recent and less extensive development of </p><p>groundwater resources in Nepal offers an opportunity to </p><p>study aquifers less influenced by human activities. </p><p> </p><p>-- The concentrations of arsenic in Nepal are roughly </p><p>equal to those found in parts of the U.S.  The Terai, with </p><p>its relatively stable population, is favorable to a study </p><p>of the long-term effects of consumption of moderately </p><p>contaminated water -- of great interest to U.S. health </p><p>authorities studying cancer risk. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Forests, People, Conflict, and Insurgency </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>REO requests USD 250,000 in FY02 and USD 150,000 in FY03 </p><p>for an initiative to counter the spread of regional </p><p>insurgencies through a sustained effort to promote </p><p>community-based natural resource management policies in </p><p>forest areas of South Asia.  The purpose is to identify </p><p>specific socio-economic measures and policy changes that </p><p>will prevent disadvantaged, disenfranchised and </p><p>dispossessed societies and communities from becoming the </p><p>perfect breeding ground for extremist ideologies and </p><p>violent movements.  Goals of the project are: </p><p> </p><p>-- Reduce tensions and conflicts between people and the </p><p>government agencies through participatory, socially </p><p>acceptable and sustainable forestry/natural resources </p><p>policies and regulations. </p><p> </p><p>-- Give local people greater access and greater </p><p>entitlement to forests and other natural resources, </p><p>enabling them to raise their standard of living and </p><p>discouraging them from extremist ideologies and </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>-- Identify corruption in forestry management and find </p><p>effective solutions to curb abuses. </p><p> </p><p>Justification:  Forests in Nepal, India Bangladesh, Bhutan </p><p>and Sri Lanka and parts of Pakistan have turned into </p><p>battlegrounds between government forces and insurgents. </p><p>Ultra-left-wing "Naxalites" reportedly control an area two </p><p>and half times the size of North Carolina in the dense </p><p>forests of eastern India.  During a recent meeting, Indian </p><p>Naxalites and Nepalese Maoist groups agreed to form a </p><p>South Asian Maoist Coalition in a forest corridor from </p><p>western Nepal to the hinterlands of Andhra Pradesh in </p><p>Southern India to facilitate their movements and </p><p>operations.  There is no one specific cause for the rise </p><p>of such insurgencies in these areas.  However, there is </p><p>now a general understanding that such insurgencies have </p><p>been fueled by the dispossession of people of their </p><p>traditional rights and access to natural resources, arcane </p><p>and socially unpopular forest policies, severe poverty, </p><p>and the alienation of forest people from the political </p><p>mainstream.  People who traditionally depend on forests </p><p>for their livelihood have joined the insurgents or are </p><p>sympathetic to their cause.  They often find it easier to </p><p>deal with insurgent groups than with corrupt government </p><p>officials.  In many forest areas, insurgent groups are </p><p>running parallel governments and issuing populist decrees, </p><p>such as raising the price of forest products sold by local </p><p>communities.  Forests also function as the resource base </p><p>of insurgent groups, which resort to lucrative trafficking </p><p>in wildlife products, illegal timber felling and other </p><p>illegal activities to finance their activities. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>South Asia Transboundary Water Quality Monitoring Network </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>REO requests USD 150,000 for FY 2002 to complete Phase </p><p>II of this initiative, which seeks to establish a </p><p>regional network for collecting and sharing water </p><p>quality data of transboundary rivers South Asia.  The </p><p>main U.S. partner for execution is DOE\'s Sandia </p><p>National Laboratories Cooperative Monitoring Center. </p><p>In the current phase of the project, the focus is on </p><p>using technology to complement ongoing and existing </p><p>projects and activities of the partners in the network </p><p>and supporting institutions to foster a common </p><p>understanding of critical water issues and improve </p><p>communication and data sharing within the region.  The </p><p>second phase of this project aims to: </p><p> </p><p>-- Broaden the partnership - include more strategic </p><p>institutions in monitoring water quality in the region. </p><p> </p><p>-- Increase the number of parameters monitored and the </p><p>geographic extent by enlarging the area of coverage </p><p>(i.e., number of mutually agreed test sites). </p><p> </p><p>-- Strengthen the partnership by providing additional </p><p>training and technological know-how. </p><p> </p><p>-- Institutionalize the partnership by creating a </p><p>permanent framework for cooperation and data sharing. </p><p> </p><p>-- Move to the policy sphere.  As the extent and </p><p>severity of regional water quality problems emerge from </p><p>these studies, we hope that the partners will be </p><p>motivated to seek support from their governments for </p><p>regional approaches to pollution mitigation. </p><p> </p><p>Justification: South Asia is one of the most water- </p><p>stressed areas of the world.  Many sub-regions, including </p><p>southern Pakistan, western and southern parts of India, </p><p>and nearly all of Afghanistan, are already facing moderate </p><p>to acute shortages of water scarcity, increasing the </p><p>danger of social conflict and fragmentation within these </p><p>societies.  Compounding the problem is the fouling of </p><p>existing supplies.  Water quality in South Asia is </p><p>degrading at a fast - and accelerating -- pace.  Pollution </p><p>of surface and ground water is caused by poorly planned </p><p>and uncontrolled growth of industries, human settlements </p><p>and agricultural runoff.  Lack of adequate water data is </p><p>hampering the ability of scientists in the region to </p><p>understand the true extent of the problem and find </p><p>effective solutions.  Regional cooperation in this area </p><p>can support sustainable development and, consequently, </p><p>social, economic, and political stability - thereby </p><p>contributing to the relaxation of regional tensions and </p><p>reducing the risk of conflict.  There is considerable </p><p>potential for embedding this project in a larger regional </p><p>approach to water quality issues funded by multilateral </p><p>lenders and other major bilateral donors -- please see the </p><p>section entitled "Asian Water Quality Coalition." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Environmental Crime Anti-Trafficking Enforcement Project </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>REO requests USD 250,000 in each of FYs 02 and 03 to </p><p>support South Asian governments in strengthening their </p><p>capacity to enforce Multilateral Environmental Agreements </p><p>(MEAs).  South Asia is in immediate need of assistance in </p><p>implementing and enforcing MEAs, especially at the </p><p>operational levels, i.e. intelligence-gathering, inter- </p><p>agency coordination, detection of contraband and smuggling </p><p>operations, prosecution of traffickers, and </p><p>institutionalization of enforcement training.  Expected </p><p>outcomes of the project include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Increased knowledge about the status of MEA enforcement </p><p>in South Asia and diagnosis of deficiencies, particularly </p><p>in intelligence and investigative techniques. </p><p> </p><p>-- A strategic plan devised by South Asian governments to </p><p>build their intelligence-gathering regarding various types </p><p>of illegal trafficking, bolster MEA enforcement capacity </p><p>and develop measures to control this illegal commerce. </p><p> </p><p>-- Enhanced regional capacity to detect illegal commerce </p><p>under several MEAs and apprehend/prosecute traffickers, </p><p>consistent with international obligations. </p><p>-- Greater domestic and international coordination and </p><p>cooperation among the various law enforcement agencies in </p><p>South Asian countries charged with enforcing MEAs. </p><p>-- Creation of an indigenous South Asian capacity to </p><p>provide field-based MEA training modules to law </p><p>enforcement officials. </p><p> </p><p>Justification: Terrorism is a threat to democracy and </p><p>civil society everywhere, and cutting off the sources of </p><p>finance and support for terrorism is one of the highest </p><p>priorities for the U.S.  Typically, when South Asian </p><p>insurgencies falter in their popular support, they link up </p><p>with existing criminal networks to finance revolutionary </p><p>activities through such varied illegal pursuits as drug </p><p>running, trafficking in women and children, smuggling of </p><p>arms and ammunition, as well as illegal commerce in </p><p>products covered under the convention on endangered </p><p>species (CITES).  More recently, the development of </p><p>illicit markets for chemicals prohibited or regulated </p><p>under the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting substances </p><p>(ODS) have opened up another extraordinarily lucrative </p><p>line of business for criminal smuggling syndicates. </p><p>Reports indicate that profits from this criminal activity </p><p>may be second only to the narcotics trade. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Asian Water Quality Coalition </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>REO requests USD 100,000 in FY02 and USD 250,000 in FY03 </p><p>to support participation by USG scientific agencies, such </p><p>as USGS and EPA, in a broad-based, multi-donor initiative </p><p>to address water quality issues in South Asia.  The funds </p><p>would be used to pay for TDY travel for consultations and </p><p>joint research by USG scientists in the region.  We would </p><p>welcome support from REO for Southeast Asia/Pacific </p><p>(Bangkok) in soliciting additional support from EAP and/or </p><p>OES for this proposal. </p><p> </p><p>Justification: See the comments on the South Asia Water </p><p>Quality Monitoring for background.  The World Bank and </p><p>other multilateral lenders, as well as international </p><p>organizations such as UNICEF and WHO, have recognized the </p><p>inefficiencies involved in designing country-specific </p><p>programs for each of the many contaminants of concern </p><p>(i.e., arsenic, fluoride, cadmium, other metals, </p><p>fertilizers, organics such as pesticides, microbiological </p><p>organisms, etc.)  As a result, a coalition of donors and </p><p>international agencies is now considering a broad </p><p>initiative on water quality for the South and Southeast </p><p>Asian regions.  These entities frequently seek world-class </p><p>expertise and consulting services from top-ranked USG </p><p>scientific agencies, but are prevented by their charters </p><p>or other technical reasons from funding USG activities. </p><p>The purpose of this request is to ensure that the premier </p><p>U.S. scientific capabilities can be employed effectively </p><p>to support an international initiative to address critical </p><p>South Asian water quality issues. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Regional Environmental Governance Initiative </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>REO requests USD 200,000 in fiscal year 2002 and USD </p><p>300,000 in FY 2003 to promote environmental good </p><p>governance in South Asia.  Small grants (not to exceed USD </p><p>25,000) will be provided, on a competitive basis, to local </p><p>and national non-governmental organizations.  The grants </p><p>will help implement projects to: </p><p> </p><p>-- Enhance civil society\'s environmental knowledge base, </p><p> </p><p>-- Build local governments\' capacity to integrate </p><p>environmental considerations into development planning, </p><p> </p><p>-- Promote effective enforcement of environmental </p><p>regulations at the local level, </p><p> </p><p>-- Strengthen local communities\' ability to manage natural </p><p>resources in an environmentally sound manner, </p><p> </p><p>-- Encourage local environmental advocacy and stewardship </p><p>using democratic means. </p><p> </p><p>Justification: One of the major causes for rapid </p><p>environmental degradation in South Asia is the poor </p><p>implementation of environmental rules and regulations and </p><p>the insufficient ability of local governments to integrate </p><p>environmental considerations into their development </p><p>planning.  The low level of environmental awareness of the </p><p>rural population and the lack of effective civil society </p><p>organizations to advocate and promote environmental </p><p>conservation further aggravates this problem.  There is an </p><p>immediate need to strengthen environmental governance at </p><p>the local level.  While there is a growing effort by </p><p>central governments to devolve more power and resources to </p><p>the local level, there has been a lack of complementary </p><p>efforts to assist local communities and governments to </p><p>manage their natural resources in a sustainable manner. As </p><p>a result, the natural resource base, the source of </p><p>livelihood and sustenance of the mostly rural people of </p><p>South Asia, is increasingly threatened. </p><p> </p><p>4. The Regional Environment Office for South Asia hopes </p><p>the above will be useful to the South Asia Bureau in </p><p>setting priorities and planning for FY 02 and 03 regional </p><p>Economic Support Funds. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
