<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000294 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VIENNA, PLEASE PASS TO IAEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ABUD, KNNP, TRGY, PREL, OVIP, OPDC, IAEA </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA UNLIKELY TO OFFER SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>IAEA BUDGET INCREASE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 013752 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On January 24 ECONOFF passed Deputy Secretary </p><p>Armitage\'s letter (REFTEL) to the Ministry\'s Assistant </p><p>Director for First United Nations Division A.O. Idowum who </p><p>said he would pass it to Foreign Minister Lamido.  Idowu was </p><p>aware of the proposed increase in the IAEA\'s 2004-2005 </p><p>budget. While noncommittal on the proposed increase, he </p><p>claimed that Nigeria is up to date in its financial </p><p>obligation to the IAEA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Idowu has been handling IAEA and disarmament issues </p><p>for the past four years and he rates Nigeria\'s engagement </p><p>with the IAEA highly, specifically thanking the IAEA for </p><p>training staff of the National Hospital, National Agency for </p><p>Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), and </p><p>academics from a number of universities during the last two </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Idowu also showed an interest in the International </p><p>Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources March 10-13, </p><p>2003 in Vienna.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will inform </p><p>the Energy Commission of Nigeria and the Nigerian Nuclear </p><p>Regulatory Authority, advising both organizations to send </p><p>representatives to the conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment:  It is doubtful that Idowu\'s enthusiasm and </p><p>support will be reflected in tangible Nigerian support for an </p><p>IAEA budget increase at a time when Nigeria\'s budget is </p><p>already stretched thin.  For instance, the Foreign Ministry </p><p>has reportedly been unable to pay its power and telephone </p><p>bills in many embassies.  However, Idowu assured us Deputy </p><p>Secretary Armitage\'s letter would reach the Foreign </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Minister\'s desk with a positive recommendation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
