<p>UNCLAS ROME 001234 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM THE U.S. MISSION TO THE UN AGENCIES IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/OMC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, EFIS, TBIO, KSCA, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN SEABIRD BYCATCH NPOA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) BRASILIA 479   B) KOTOK/BERTON 2/22 E-MAIL </p><p> </p><p>1. AS A FOLLOW UP TO AND UPDATE OF REF B) E-MAIL, U.S. </p><p>    MISSION PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING FORMAL RESPONSE TO REF A) </p><p>INQUIRY REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BRASILIAN </p><p>NATIONAL PLAN OF ACTION (NPOA) FOR SEABIRD BYCATCH. </p><p> </p><p>2. INITIALLY, ALT PERM REP SPOKE WITH JEREMY TURNER, </p><p>CHIEF OF THE FISHING TECHNOLOGIES SERVICES, PART OF THE </p><p>FISHERIES INDUSTRIES DIVISION OF THE UN FOOD & </p><p>AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION (FAO).  WHAT TURNER SAID WAS </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CONTENTS OF REF A), </p><p>WHICH SUGGESTED THAT FAO HAD BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND TO </p><p>APPEALS FOR HELP FROM CEMAVE, PART OF THE GOB\'S </p><p>ENVIRONMENT MINISTRY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSERVATION OF </p><p>WILD BIRDS.  INSTEAD, TURNER STATED THAT THE FAO HAD BEEN </p><p>"PUSHING, PUSHING, PUSHING" FOR THE GOB TO ACCEPT FAO </p><p>FUNDS (USD 10,000) TO GET STARTED.  ACCORDING TO TURNER, </p><p>THE PROBLEM IS THE GOB\'S LACK OF A PROCEDURAL WAY OF </p><p>ACCEPTING OUTSIDE FUNDING FROM AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THE </p><p>FAO.  HE CITED A 12/16/02 E-MAIL IN WHICH THE LOCAL FAO </p><p>REP IN BRASILIA REPEATED THE SAME MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>3. TURNER ADMITTED THE FAO HAD BEEN SLOW TO MOVE IN THE </p><p>FIRST HALF OF 2002, BUT SAID THEY HAD BEEN PUSHING THE </p><p>ISSUE SINCE MID-YEAR.  FAO WAS CONSIDERING THE DISBURSAL </p><p>OF FUNDS DIRECTLY TO WHOMEVER THE GOB CHOOSES IN ORDER TO </p><p>SOLVE THE FUNDING PROBLEM, BUT EVEN FAO\'S OWN ACCOUNTANTS </p><p>ARE UNSURE IF THAT IS POSSIBLE.  SO THE FAO CONTINUES TO </p><p>SEARCH FOR A WAY OF GETTING THE MONEY TO THE RIGHT PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>4. ALT PERM REP CALLED ON SENIOR FISHERIES OFFICER </p><p>WILFRIED THIELE (WORKS DIRECTLY FOR TURNER, WHO IS AWAY </p><p>FOR TWO WEEKS) ON 3/19 FOR AN UPDATE.  THIELE COMMENTED </p><p>    THAT THE SEARCH GOES ON FOR A PROPER FUNDING MECHANISM, </p><p>AND THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT UNIQUE TO BRAZIL.  HE OPINED </p><p>THAT ULTIMATELY, THE RESOLUTION WILL INVOLVE TRANSFERRING </p><p>FUNDS TO THE BRAZILIAN FAO REP, WHO MAY BE ABLE TO PAY </p><p>FROM ACTUAL INVOICES SUBMITTED.  MEANWHILE, THE FUNDS </p><p>CONTINUE TO SIT IN ROME. </p><p> </p><p>5. IT IS IRONIC THAT AT THE SAME TIME THAT FAO AND </p><p>BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND A MECHANISM </p><p>FOR UTILIZING THE $40,000 FROM FAO, FAO DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>JACQUES DIOUF TRAVELED TO BRAZIL TO ANNOUNCE A $1 MILLION </p><p>CONTRIBUTION FROM FAO\'S REGULAR PROGRAM FOR TECHNICAL </p><p>COOPERATION FOR ASSISTANCE TO BRAZIL\'S "ZERO HUNGER" </p><p>PROGRAM.  ACCORDING TO THE FEBRUARY 14, 2003 FAO PRESS </p><p>RELEASE, THESE FUNDS WILL BE USED, INTER ALIA TO DESIGN </p><p>AND OFFER CAPACITY-BUILDING COURSES TO COUNTER THE </p><p>EFFECTS OF DROUGHT AND BOLSTER THE PROFITABILITY AND </p><p>PRODUCTIVITY OF THE RURAL POPULATIONS OF NORTH-EASTERN </p><p>BRAZIL. </p><p> </p><p>HALL </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01234 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
