Action Request:  Post received via a diplomatic note from </p><p>the Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs the following </p><p>letter regarding new U.S. procedures pertaining to foreign </p><p>air marshals programs.  The note and letter formally request </p><p>U.S. government permission to allow Royal Jordanian Airlines </p><p>(RJ) to operate flights to the United States with armed law </p><p>enforcement officers on board.  We understand from the </p><p>Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority(CAA) that RJ and CAA have </p><p>separately discussed such procedures with Civil Aviation </p><p>Security Liaison Officer (CASLO) in Rome.  Please advise on </p><p>next steps. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Begin text of letter. </p><p> </p><p>The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has used air marshals to </p><p>provide extra security aboard all Royal Jordanian (RJ) </p><p>flights for a number of years (since 1971).  Therefore, Air </p><p>Marshal policies and procedures pertaining to unlawful </p><p>interference and security of passengers, crew and the </p><p>aircraft on international routes are well established by the </p><p>Jordan Civil Aviation Authority who had delegated this role </p><p>to the Jordan Armed forces/Special Aviation Security and </p><p>protection unit. </p><p> </p><p>We strongly believe and based on our experience for over 30 </p><p>years that our Air Marshal program is well organized and no </p><p>violations were reported by any officials at International </p><p>Airports on this program including USG agencies and TSA. </p><p> </p><p>Due to the new regulatory requirements for an air marshal </p><p>program set by the USG after September 11, we would like to </p><p>inform you that it is the intention of the Government of </p><p>Jordan to use armed air marshals and we certify that our </p><p>armed air marshals are duly trained and authorized law </p><p>enforcement officers. </p><p> </p><p>The Government of Jordan kindly request the USG permission </p><p>for our National Carrier (RJ) to operate direct flights into </p><p>the United States with armed law Enforcement Officers (LEO) </p><p>onboard. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you in advance for your cooperation. </p><p>End text. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
