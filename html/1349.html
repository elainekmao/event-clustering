THE PERMANENT </p><p>SECRETARY, BY TURNS CHOLERIC AND ELATED, WELCOMED THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>INITIATIVE. ADMITTING HE WAS CAUGHT UNPREPARED TO GIVE </p><p>VETTED GOVERNMENT POSITIONS, CHIWEWE NEVERTHELESS SAID </p><p>THAT FIRST THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WOULD BE TO </p><p>PRESENT TO PRESIDENT MUGABE THE UNITED NATIONS AND </p><p>UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UN/UNDP) MISSION </p><p>REPORT ON THE ZIMBABWEAN FAST TRACK LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM\'S TECHNICAL DEFICIENCIES.  THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE WOULD THEN INVITE DONORS WHO WISHED TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE LAND REFORM PROGRAM WITHOUT CONDITIONS TO DO SO. </p><p>THE SENIOR ZIMBABWEAN OFFICIAL ALSO ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06321  01 OF 03  111147Z </p><p>IN ELIMINATING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S "SIEGE" </p><p>AGAINST HIS COUNTRY AND PRESIDENT, A STATE OF AFFAIRS </p><p>THAT FOSTERED INSECURITY AND WAR TALK.  IN TURN, HE </p><p>OFFERED TO APPROACH PRESIDENT MUGABE TO ADVISE HIM TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES ON THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS.  WE ARE CHARY ABOUT HOW FAR WE CAN TAKE THIS </p><p>ENTERPRISE, AND CHIWEWE SO FAR IS AN UNTESTED VEHICLE OF </p><p>UNKNOWN RELIABILITY.  BUT THE FACT THAT HE TOLD US HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S PRINCIPAL CONCERNS MAKES US CAUTIOUSLY </p><p>HOPEFUL THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS MIGHT BE READY TO ENGAGE IN </p><p>REAL AND LESS CONFRONTATIONAL DIALOGUE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON NOVEMBER 8 AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, UNDP RESIDENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE VICTOR ANGELO AND DCM CALLED ON MINISTRY </p><p>OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMANENT SECRETARY WILLARD CHIWEWE, </p><p>WHO WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THREE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>OFFICIALS WHO REMAINED SILENT THROUGHOUT THE DISCUSSION. </p><p>ANGELO LED OFF SAYING THAT IT WAS OUR COMMON PURPOSE TO </p><p>BE OF HELP AND WERE THUS SEEKING THE PERMANENT </p><p>SECRETARY\'S ADVICE ON HOW CERTAIN KEY AMBASSADORS MIGHT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO ZIMBABWEANS FINDING A SOLUTION TO THEIR </p><p>OWN PROBLEMS.  THE UNDP CHIEF WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO </p><p>PROMOTE GREATER DISCUSSION AMONG KEY STAKEHOLDERS WITH A </p><p>VIEW TO FACILITATING A CONSENSUS BUILDING PROCESS.  HE </p><p>STRESSED THAT THERE WAS A SENSE OF URGENCY AMONG THE </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY TO GET THIS PROCESS UNDER WAY SOON, </p><p>BECAUSE CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTRY BEING WHAT THEY ARE, </p><p>WAITING TO HELP MIGHT LEAVE IT TOO LATE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE PERMANENT SECRETARY REACTED BY EXPRESSING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06321  01 OF 03  111147Z </p><p>HIS "HAPPY SURPRISE" THAT THE U.S. AMBASSADOR HAD AGREED </p><p>TO JOIN ANGELO, CALLING THE GESTURE "VERY SIGNIFICANT." </p><p>HE WAS PLEASED TO NOTE THE USG\'S SUPPORT FOR THE LAND </p><p>REFORM PROCESS.  HE ADMITTED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT "TENDED </p><p>TO FEEL GLOBAL LEADERS TAKING A BENIGN NEUTRALITY" </p><p>TOWARD ITS EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE LAND PROBLEM.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT IN ZIMBABWE, "WE DO NOT HAVE THE BASIS OF </p><p>A CONFLICT WITH THE STATUS OF AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM." </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE IS CONVINCED THAT WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL GOOOWILL THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEMS, WHICH </p><p>ARE SMALLER THAN THEY LOOK, AND CALLED ON THE USG TO </p><p>ASSERT ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THIS CONNECTION.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR REJOINED THAT THE PERMANENT SECRETARY SHOULD </p><p>SEE THIS VISIT AS A CONTINUATION OF EFFORTS TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE GOOD WILL TO THIS GOVERNMENT.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>IT WAS TIME TO EXPAND AND INTENSIFY THE DIALOGUE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) TURNING TO THE UNDP RESREP\'S REQUEST FOR ADVICE, </p><p>CHIWEWE REMARKED THAT, "WE NEED TO UNBUNDLE VARIOUS </p><p>ACTIONS AND SEQUENCE THEM."  FIRST AMONG THESE WAS TO </p><p>MAKE A FORMAL PRESENTATION OF THE FINAL REPORT OF THE </p><p>UN/UNDP TECHNICAL MISSION TO PRESIDENT MUGABE. HE </p><p>EXPECTED THE PRESIDENT WOULD ENDORSE THE FINDINGS OF THE </p><p>REPORT, WHICH WOULD GIVE COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0120 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06321  02 OF 03  111148Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      COME-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01 </p><p>      H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------9DA618  111148Z /38 </p><p>P 111147Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7608 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 006321 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06321  02 OF 03  111148Z </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/09/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, EAGR, UNDP, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDP RESREP AND AMBASSADOR CONSULT WITH </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMANENT SECRETARY ON STEPS </p><p>TO DEFUSE TENSIONS IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY "A NEW START."  HE SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT THE VISIT OF UNDP ADMINISTRATOR MALLOCH-BROWN </p><p>SHOULD BE USED AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE </p><p>PRESENTATION.  ANGELO COMMENTED THAT HE APPRECIATED THE </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY\'S OBSERVATION AND LOOKED FORWARD TO </p><p>CONSULTATIONS AT CHIWEWE\'S LEVEL TO GIVE FINAL SHAPE TO </p><p>THE REPORT WHICH WAS STILL IN DRAFT FORM. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) NEXT, CHIWEWE STRESSED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS NOT </p><p>READY FOR DONOR COMMUNITY CONDITIONALITY TO THE "FAST </p><p>TRACK" LAND REDISTRIBUTION EXERCISE.  THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THE TECHNICAL TEAM HAD AGREED ON A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAD WEAKNESSES.  HE SAID THAT THE DONORS </p><p>COULD HELP IMMEDIATELY, FOR EXAMPLE, BY PROVIDING </p><p>EXPERTS ON DEMARCATION, LAND AND IMPROVEMENT VALUATORS </p><p>AND AERIAL SURVEYING EQUIPMENT. HE STRESSED THAT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVE WAS TO "GET IT [THE </p><p>FAST TRACK LAND REDISTRIBUTION EXERCISE] OVER WITH." </p><p>AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, CHIWEWE CONTINUED, "WE ARE </p><p>INVITING DONORS WHO WANT TO SUPPORT THE LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM WITHOUT CONDITIONS.  IF THEY DON\'T WANT TO COME, </p><p>THEY SHOULDN\'T.  IN THAT CASE, WE\'LL DO A BUSH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06321  02 OF 03  111148Z </p><p>RESETTLEMENT." THE PERMANENT SECRETARY REITERATED THAT </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COULD NOT TELL HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO PUT A HALT TO THE RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE, </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE RECEPTIVE TO CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>CRITICISM, FOR EXAMPLE, "REFINE THIS, OR REFINE THAT." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD EXPLAINED THAT HE AND ANGELO </p><p>WERE WILLING TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP BECAUSE, WITH ALL </p><p>DUE RESPECT, HE DID NOT THINK PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD DO </p><p>SO.  THE POINT WAS TO UNLOCK THE DOOR TO DISCUSSION.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT THE USG HAD SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>RULE OF LAW ON THE COMMERCIAL FARMS IN ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT, IN INITIATING THE DISCUSSION, DID NOT </p><p>WISH TO PAPER OVER DIFFERENCES.  HE WONDERED PERHAPS IF </p><p>THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER WAY TO TACKLE THAT DISCUSSION. </p><p>CHIWEWE CONCURRED, AGREEING THAT UNVOICED DISAGREEMENT </p><p>SHOULD BE AVOIDED.  IN A RARE MOMENT OF SELF-CRITICISM, </p><p>HE OBSERVED THAT DIFFERENCES WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY DATING BACK TO SEPTEMBER 1998 STILL REMAINED. </p><p>"PERHAPS THE STANCE I TOOK DURING THE 1998 DONORS\' </p><p>CONFERENCE GAVE A SENSE OF SUCCESS."  AMBASSADOR </p><p>MCDONALD ASKED THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE KEEP AN OPEN MIND, </p><p>AS THE USG WAS PREPARED TO MOVE FORWARD AND ZIMBABWE </p><p>COULD NOT SOLVE ITS PROBLEMS ALONE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY THEN OBSERVEO THAT, </p><p>"IN THE PAST TWO YEARS YOU\'VE PICKEO UP A LANGUAGE OF </p><p>WAR THAT WAS NOT IN OUR VOCABULARY IN THE LAST EIGHT </p><p>YEARS."  IT COMES, HE SAIO, FROM A PERCEPTION THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS "AN ANIMAL UNOER SIEGE," ANO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CREATED THAT.  HE THANKEO ANGELO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06321  02 OF 03  111148Z </p><p>ANO THE AMBASSAOOR FOR MAKING THE FIRST MOVE BUT </p><p>INQUIRED, CAN WE HELP REMOVE THE INTERNATIONAL SIEGE </p><p>AGAINST THE PRESIDENT?"  THE UNDP RESIDENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE REPLIED THAT HE WAS TRYING.  HE HAD TOLD </p><p>THE DONORS THAT THAT WAS NOT THE BEST APPROACH AND HAD </p><p>COUNSELED THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION TO MOVE FROM ITS </p><p>CURRENT POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) WITH THE CREATION OF CONDITIONS TO REMOVE </p><p>INSECURITY AND SIEGE, CHIWEWE STATED THAT HE WAS </p><p>"PREPARED TO SAY TO PRESIDENT MUGABE THAT THE GESTURE </p><p>NEEDS TO BE RECIPROCATED. I COULD SAY TO THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>\'LET\'S CREATE THE NECESSARY ENVIRONMENT TO ENGAGE THE </p><p>DONORS.\'"  SPECIFICALLY, HE WOULD RECOMMEND TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT THAT, "THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE MUST BE SEEN </p><p>TO ENFORCE THE LAW IN RESPECT OF FARM OCCUPATIONS." </p><p>CHIWEWE CONTINUED THAT HE WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT </p><p>THE LAW WAS ENFORCEABLE ONLY UNDER CONDITIONS OF ORDER. </p><p>UNDERSCORING THAT HE WOULD ACT AS A BRIDGE IF THE DONORS </p><p>WERE SATISFIED THAT THERE IS LAW AND ORDER ON THE FARMS. </p><p>ONCE EMBARKED ON THIS PATH, HE LOOKED TO THE WEST TO </p><p>CONTINUE TAKING CONFIDENCE BUILDING STEPS, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>BRINGING THE IMF CLOSER TO ZIMBABWE\'S POSITION AND </p><p>SECURING A WORLD BANK MORATORIUM FROM CALLING IN LOANS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0121 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06321  03 OF 03  111148Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      COME-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01 </p><p>      H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------9DA61B  111148Z /38 </p><p>P 111147Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7609 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 006321 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06321  03 OF 03  111148Z </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/09/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, EAGR, UNDP, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDP RESREP AND AMBASSADOR CONSULT WITH </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMANENT SECRETARY ON STEPS </p><p>TO DEFUSE TENSIONS IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ANGELO OBSERVED THAT THIS WAS NOT "A \'WAITING </p><p>FOR GODOT\' EXERCISE.  TIME IS AGAINST US.  HE COUNSELED </p><p>CHIWEWE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE TO TAKE A </p><p>PRAGMATIC APPROACH AND ESTABLISH ORDER, IDENTIFY THE </p><p>ISSUES AND SAY THAT IT IS WORKING TO ADDRESS THESE.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF DONORS DID NOT UNDERSTAND </p><p>WHY THE UN/UNDP MISSION WAS PURSUING THIS COURSE OF </p><p>ACTION. HE ASKED FOR GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, TO WHICH </p><p>CHIWEWE RESPONDED THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>MADE NO STATEMENT DURING THE UN/UNDP MISSION\'S STAY IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  THE PERMANENT SECRETARY WOULD TRY TO KEEP A </p><p>LID ON THE PRESS.  ASKED WHAT ELSE HE HAD IN MIND </p><p>REGARDING LIFTING OF THE SIEGE, CHIWEWE CONCEDED THAT HE </p><p>HAD NOT RECEIVED ADVANCED NOTIFICATION OF THE ISSUES TO </p><p>BE DISCUSSED AT THE MEETING, BUT THAT "ONCE WE SET THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK RIGHT, AND CONTINUE THE PROCESS STARTED, YOU </p><p>SHOULDN\'T SOLICIT DEFINITIVE GOVERNMENT POSITIONS." </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE THEN TOLD </p><p>CHIWEWE THAT THERE ARE INDIRECT WAYS TO PURSUE THE </p><p>DIALOGUE, BUT THE GOVERNMENT WAS FRUSTRATING THESE.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE HAD NOT MET </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06321  03 OF 03  111148Z </p><p>WITH THE UNIONS (I.E., THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION, THE </p><p>INDIGENOUS COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION AND THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>FARMERS\' UNION) TO DISCUSS THE COMING AGRICULTURAL YEAR </p><p>AND LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS.  THE UNDP RESIDENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED THE PERMANENT SECRETARY THAT HE </p><p>HAD DIFFICULTY PERSUADING AGRICULTURE MINISTER TO DO SO. </p><p>CHIWEWE CHOSE TO INTERPRET IN THIS ACCOUNT AN </p><p>INSINUATION BY ANGELO THAT THE DONOR COMMUNITY WAS </p><p>TRYING TO LOBBY THE GOVERNMENT TO LISTEN TO ITS OWN </p><p>PEOPLE AND IMPOSE THE AGENDA FOR DISCUSSION.  HE </p><p>LAUNCHED INTO A BILIOUS REJECTION OF THE SUGGESTION AND </p><p>DEFENDED HOTLY HIS GOVERNMENT\'S RECORD ON COMMUNICATION </p><p>WITH THE UNION.  ANGELO AND THE AMBASSADOR WORKED IN </p><p>TANDEM TO CALM CHIWEWE, EXPLAINING ONLY THAT THE FARMERS </p><p>HAD SOME REAL CONCERNS AND THAT THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY WAS ADVOCATING NO PARTICULAR POSITION ON THE </p><p>MATTER ONLY BETTER COMMUNICATION.  A MORE RELAXED </p><p>CHIWEWE SUGGESTED THAT MISHECK SIBANDA IN THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE WOULD BE THE PERSON TO APPROACH ON </p><p>THE MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) CHIWEWE IS ARGUABLY THE MOST POWERFUL AND </p><p>INFLUENTIAL PERMANENT SECRETARY IN GOVERNMENT TODAY.  HE </p><p>IS A PROTEGE OF PRESIDENTIAL CONFIDANT AND REPUTED POWER </p><p>BROKER CHARLES UTETE.  IN THE EARLY POST-INDEPENDENCE </p><p>YEARS CHIWEWE WORKED IN THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.  THE FACTS ALONE SUGGEST THAT </p><p>CHIWEWE IS IN A POSITION TO TRY TO PERSUADE THE </p><p>PRESIDENT TO ALTER THE CURRENT COURSE OF HIS POLICY.  TO </p><p>DATE WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE PERMANENT SECRETARY HAS </p><p>NOT USED HIS POSITION IN THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06321  03 OF 03  111148Z </p><p>TO MAKE FRIENDS FOR ZIMBABWE ABROAD.  THE RUSSIAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR, FOR EXAMPLE, IS STILL AWAITING AN </p><p>APPOINTMENT TO MAKE HIS COURTESY CALL ON CHIWEWE DESPITE </p><p>A REQUEST TWO MONTHS AGO.  THE SOUTH AFRICAN HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER TOLD US RECENTLY THAT HE HAS SOME BILATERAL </p><p>PROBLEMS TO SORT OUT AND CHIWEWE KEEPS AVOIDING HIM. </p><p>THE FACT THAT THE PERMANENT SECRETARY RECEIVED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND ANGELO FAIRLY QUICKLY IS EXTRAORDINARY IN </p><p>ITSELF.  IT SUGGESTS TO US THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>LOOKING FOR A WAY TO END ITS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION AS </p><p>A MEANS TO GET OUT OF ITS CURRENT FIX AND MAY BE READY </p><p>TO DEAL.  NEVERTHELESS, WILLARD CHIWEWE REMAINS AN </p><p>UNTESTED VEHICLE OF UNKNOWN RELIABILITY IN DELIVERING </p><p>DESIRABLE BEHAVIOR FROM THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT: WE DO </p><p>NOT FULLY TRUST HIM.
