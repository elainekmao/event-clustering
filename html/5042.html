<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000068 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL, SIMS AND AF/S RAYNOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT: EDITOR ARRESTED UNDER AIPPA; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Norma Edwards (66), the editor of the independent </p><p>      provincial weekly "The Mirror" was arrested and </p><p>      charged under the controversial Access to </p><p>      Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) on </p><p>      January 3 for "publishing a false story."  Edwards </p><p>      was charged for running a story that appeared in the </p><p>      December 19 edition on the arrests of National </p><p>      Constitutional Assembly (NCA) activists and </p><p>      opposition Movement for democratic Change (MDC) </p><p>      activists in the town of Masvingo, 293 kilometers </p><p>      south of the capital Harare.  In the story, the </p><p>      paper chronicled the events surrounding the arrest </p><p>      of the four activists and their alleged ill- </p><p>      treatment by the police while being held two nights </p><p>      for purportedly masterminding a work stoppage in the </p><p>      town.  Edwards was released January 6 and remanded </p><p>      out of custody to February 19, 2003.  The police </p><p>      have also questioned Kennedy Murwira, the journalist </p><p>      who wrote the story, and recorded a warned and </p><p>      cautioned statement. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Since AIPPA became law on March 15, 2002, twelve </p><p>      journalists working for the private media, including four </p><p>      editors have been arrested and charged for violating </p><p>      Section 80 of the Act.  The Section falls under what is </p><p>      termed "Abuse of Journalistic Privilege."  According to </p><p>      AIPPA, journalists are said to have "abused their </p><p>      privilege" by writing falsehoods and/or fabricating </p><p>      information.  The offense carries a fine of up to Z$100,000 </p><p>      or imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years.  So </p><p>      far, no journalist has been imprisoned or fined for </p><p>      violating AIPPA. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
