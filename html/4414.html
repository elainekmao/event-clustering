The Cyprus issue, Turkey\'s EU membership, </p><p>Iraq, NATO expansion, and bilateral relations are on the </p><p>Presidents\' agenda.  On the eve of his Prague trip, </p><p>President Sezer was briefed by high-level Foreign Ministry </p><p>officials on the key issues of Turkish foreign policy </p><p>including  Cyprus, Iraq and the EU.  "Hurriyet" describes </p><p>the Bush-Sezer meeting as `historic\'.  President Sezer will </p><p>also hold meetings with the French President and the Prime </p><p>Ministers of Denmark, Italy and Spain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan\'s Germany trip: Today\'s papers give conflicting news </p><p>on Erdogan\'s visit to Germany.  "Milliyet" reports that </p><p>Erdogan failed to secure German support for Turkey. </p><p>Although he was given a warm welcome in Germany, the meeting </p><p>with Schroeder was reportedly rather distant.  In his </p><p>meeting with Erdogan, Schroeder said that Turkey first had </p><p>to solve the Cyprus issue, maintain the separation of state </p><p>and religion, and meet the requirements of democracy. </p><p>Schroeder also drew attention to a lawsuit filed against </p><p>German foundations in Turkey, and stressed Germany\'s </p><p>sensitivity on this issue.  Erdogan in turn urged Schroeder </p><p>to trust in Turkish justice.  During the press conference </p><p>with German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer,  Erdogan </p><p>stressed Turkey\'s readiness for EU accession talks, while </p><p>Fischer hesitated to give a positive message.   However, </p><p>"Radikal" reports that the result of the meeting with </p><p>Schroeder was positive. </p><p>New Government:  All papers and TV channels cover ceremonies </p><p>marking the transfer of power to the new government. </p><p>"Milliyet" draws attention to messages issued by new Prime </p><p>Minister Abdullah Gul.  Gul was quoted as saying that `We </p><p>have no secret agenda.  Transparency is our guiding </p><p>principle.  Turkey will not experience a new anti- </p><p>fundamentalist crack down\'.  Gul added that the first task </p><p>to be carried out by the government would be to adjust </p><p>regulations related to state security courts and detention </p><p>periods.  "Milliyet" reports that during the hand-over </p><p>ceremony at the Prime Ministry, Ecevit drew Gul\'s attention </p><p>to three sensitive issues: Cyprus, Iraq and the economy. </p><p>Most papers report the Bush phone call to Gul from Air Force </p><p>1 to congratulate Gul on his new post.  "Sabah" reports that </p><p>during the phone call Bush invited Gul to visit the US in </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: "Cumhuriyet" reports that the US is pressing hard </p><p>for a breakthrough on Cyprus following Kofi Annan\'s peace </p><p>plan announcement.  Within this framework, US Cyprus envoy </p><p>Thomas Weston was in Ankara yesterday for meetings with </p><p>Foreign Ministry officials.  Speaking to the press after his </p><p>meetings, Weston said that Turkey should review the peace </p><p>plan carefully to work out a settlement.  Weston voiced hope </p><p>for the new government to make a breakthrough on Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Washington Post article: "Cumhuriyet" carries the Washington </p><p>Post story on Ankara - Washington negotiations on an </p><p>economic and military package for the compensation of the </p><p>Turkey\'s losses in the event of an operation in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CODEL Issa visit: "Radikal" covers the visit with the </p><p>headline "US delegation in Ankara", and reports that the US </p><p>congress members met with U/S Ziyal yesterday.  Following </p><p>the meeting with Ziyal, delegation leader Darrell Issa told </p><p>journalists that `as the only democratic country in the </p><p>Muslim world, Turkey\'s views are very important.  This </p><p>dialogue will continue until the regime changes in Iraq\'. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a)  NATO Summit </p><p>b)  UN Cyprus Plan </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Huge Gap" </p><p>Fikret Ertan notes the military gap between the US and </p><p>Europe in the Islamic-intellectual Zaman (11/20): "NATO </p><p>Secretary General Robertson once again emphasized the need </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to increase NATO\'s military capabilities due to a series of </p><p>new threats such as terrorism and weapons of mass </p><p>destruction.  Actually, he has been issuing similar warnings </p><p>for over a year, and has also criticized the Europeans for </p><p>wasting money on defense. . Robertson  is trying to raise </p><p>awareness on the need for the Alliance to monitor European </p><p>defense spending, which is now 150 billion Euro, to make </p><p>sure that it is properly spent. .  The fact of the matter is </p><p>that the gap in military capabilities between the US and </p><p>Europe has been widening in the post-cold war era. . In </p><p>contrast with the defense budget cuts that Europe has been </p><p>making, the US is spending at least twice as much for </p><p>defense capabilities, and US spending is increasing still </p><p>further since 9/11. . This is one of the major and important </p><p>issues at the Prague summit, and the gap is of Turkey\'s </p><p>direct concern." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A Tough Plan" </p><p>Zafer Atay commented in economic/politics Dunya (11/20): </p><p>"Despite its major downside on the territorial issue, the </p><p>Kofi Annan plan deserves to be treated seriously.  This plan </p><p>should be the basis for negotiations.  The Turkish side can </p><p>correct the plan\'s mistakes and  carry out a series of fine- </p><p>tuning of the text by sitting at the negotiating table. </p><p>That might produce a long-lasting and just agreement between </p><p>the two sides.  On the other hand, the UNSG should extend </p><p>the deadline.  It might also be helpful to the settlement </p><p>process if a solution is found to prevent Greek blackmailing </p><p>to the benefit of the Greek Cypriots on the EU enlargement </p><p>issue." </p><p></p></div>
