<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 OTTAWA 002014 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR ONDCP (CRANE, BAUM), CNC, NDIC; DOJ FOR </p><p>OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (BURKE); DHS FOR BTS; DHS </p><p>FOR CNO (MACKIN) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, KRIM, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN OFFICIALS DISCUSS DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) Summary: In a series of meetings with Dr. Barry Crane </p><p>of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, </p><p>officials from several Canadian government departments set </p><p>out the government of Canada\'s drug control strategy. While </p><p>the GoC appears intent on displaying a more serious approach </p><p>to drug control, it wants to devote more attention to public </p><p>education and studies than enforcement, and the scale of its </p><p>efforts seems inadequate in relation to Canada\'s increasing </p><p>drug problems. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) White House Office of National Drug Control Policy </p><p>Deputy Director for Supply Reduction Dr. Barry Crane </p><p>discussed drug control policy with officials from several </p><p>Canadian federal government departments in Ottawa, on July 8. </p><p>Dr. Crane visited officials at the Department of Foreign </p><p>Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), Health Canada and </p><p>the Canadian Center on Substance Abuse, the Department of </p><p>Justice, and the Department of the Solicitor General. He also </p><p>held a lunch meeting with members of the Parliament of Canada </p><p>on Parliament Hill. Dr. Crane discussed the broad objectives </p><p>of U.S. drug policy, and concerns about current trends in the </p><p>use of methamphetamine by Americans. The Canadian officials </p><p>described their government\'s new national drug strategy, the </p><p>roles played by their respective departments, and GoC\'s </p><p>proposal that possession of small amounts of marijuana be </p><p>decriminalized. Other U.S. representatives attending the </p><p>meetings were Richard Baum, Branch Chief, International </p><p>Policy and Interdiction, </p><p>White House Office of National Drug Control Policy; Tony </p><p>Pratapas, DEA Attache, U.S. Embassy Ottawa; and Mary Witt and </p><p>Craig Bryant, Political Officers, U.S. Embassy Ottawa. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Dr. Crane\'s Message </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Dr. Crane delivered a consistent message at each </p><p>meeting. While it is not the role of U.S. officials to tell </p><p>Canada what drug policies it should follow, Dr. Crane said, </p><p>it is the responsibility of the U.S. government to protect </p><p>its population, and particularly its children, from illicit </p><p>drugs. Noting that Canada is a significant supplier of </p><p>precursor chemicals, used in the illegal production of </p><p>methamphetamine in the U.S., Dr. Crane commented that </p><p>methamphetamine might be more widely consumed in the U.S. </p><p>than cocaine in just a few years. As a result, the USG is </p><p>compelled to take actions to try and limit, if not eliminate, </p><p>the methamphetamine threat. Dr. Crane also noted that high </p><p>potency marijuana presents a similar risk to the U.S. High </p><p>potency marijuana, Dr. Crane observed, is the largest single </p><p>cause of narcotics-related emergency room admissions in the </p><p>U.S. Dr. Crane stressed the need for the U.S. and Canada to </p><p>work vigorously together to safeguard our societies from the </p><p>threat posed by illegal drug </p><p>s. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Turning specifically to GoC\'s proposal to decriminalize </p><p>possession of small amounts of marijuana (Bill C-38, now </p><p>pending in the House of Commons) Dr. Crane noted that the </p><p>problem with decriminalization is that, while we are trying </p><p>to persuade our children to avoid marijuana, Canada\'s </p><p>decriminalization plan sends the message that marijuana use </p><p>is acceptable. For the U.S., Dr. Crane calmly stated, such a </p><p>development on our northern border would necessitate stronger </p><p>U.S. interdiction efforts, in order to protect American </p><p>children. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Canada\'s response </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade </p><p>(DFAIT) - Ruth Archibald, Senior Coordinator, International </p><p>Crime and Terrorism Division, and Terry Cormier, Director, </p><p>International Crime and Terrorism Division, responded that </p><p>Canada is in the process of renewing its national drug </p><p>strategy. Canadian officials are concerned about the impact </p><p>of illicit drugs on the health of every Canadian, Archibald </p><p>noted. Health Canada will continue to provide leadership and </p><p>coordination for Canada\'s drug strategy, as it has done in </p><p>the past, but DFAIT, Justice Canada, and the Solicitor </p><p>General\'s Department will also be involved in planning and </p><p>executing Canada\'s response to narcotics. Archibald indicated </p><p>that execution of what she termed as Canada\'s "renewed" drug </p><p>strategy would proceed independently of the cannabis reform </p><p>bill introduced in May in the House of Commons. </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) Archibald said Canada\'s renewed drug strategy will </p><p>continue to emphasize demand reduction, i.e., public </p><p>education, and will focus on the more vulnerable sectors of </p><p>society in an effort to decrease the number of Canadians who </p><p>try drugs. She said Canada has developed a fair amount of </p><p>expertise, at the federal level, about demand reduction based </p><p>on government programs to deter alcohol abuse and tobacco </p><p>use. Other key components of the new drug strategy, Archibald </p><p>said, will include training programs for law enforcement (one </p><p>example: how to detect marijuana levels in drivers), and </p><p>increased funding for collecting and analyzing drug use data. </p><p>She expressed appreciation for Dr. Crane\'s visit, and said </p><p>they are very interested in learning from our experience. In </p><p>particular, Archibald indicated the Canadians would like </p><p>further discussions with U.S. officials on how we test for </p><p>drug use, how we track drug use among certain populations, </p><p>and our methods for collecting and evaluating data to </p><p>identify drug use trend </p><p>s. (Note: Archibald and other Canadian officials will travel </p><p>to Washington the week of July 14 to discuss Canada\'s drug </p><p>policy, and particularly GoC\'s proposal to decriminalize </p><p>marijuana, with members of Congress. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Health Canada - Dr. Crane met with Beth Pieterson, </p><p>Director General; Cathy Airth, Director for Drug Strategy; </p><p>Carol Bouchard, Director of the Office of Controlled </p><p>Substances; Richard Viau, Director of the Drug Analysis </p><p>Service; and Patricia Begin, Director for Research and </p><p>Policy, at the offices of Health Canada. Pieterson led the </p><p>discussion by making clear Canada would continue to approach </p><p>drug abuse primarily as a health issue. She admitted that </p><p>GoC\'s previous drug strategy suffered from inadequate funding </p><p>and attention.  Pieterson said this was not the case now, </p><p>that GoC is committed to providing funding for research, </p><p>rehabilitation and, most importantly, counter-narcotics </p><p>education and messaging. Pieterson said Health Canada is </p><p>studying how best to get its \'don\'t do drugs\' message across </p><p>to Canada\'s youth, and is looking at the approaches followed </p><p>by other countries to determine what has worked, and what </p><p>hasn\'t. She commented that one aspect of Canada\'s strategy is </p><p>to encourage parents to take a mor </p><p>e active part in directing their children away from drug use. </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) Cathy Airth said the renewal of Canada\'s drug strategy </p><p>had been recommended by the Auditor General of Canada, </p><p>following a review of the federal government\'s past </p><p>expenditures on drug abuse prevention. As a result of this </p><p>review, she indicated the Canadian government plans to almost </p><p>double the amount it spends annually on drug control.  Airth </p><p>repeated that Canada\'s drug strategy would emphasize </p><p>prevention, that they want to reach people before they begin </p><p>using drugs. Dr. Crane noted it is important to emphasize </p><p>both prevention of drug use and law enforcement,that there </p><p>should be a balance. He pointed out that, according to recent </p><p>U.N. drug reports, the U.S. is making progress in reducing </p><p>the demand for illegal drugs by Americans. </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) Carole Bouchard, Director of the Office of Controlled </p><p>Substances at Health Canada, then presented an update on the </p><p>implementation of Canada\'s precursor chemical regulations. </p><p>Phase I of the regulations, directed at the importing, </p><p>exporting, production, and packaging of Class A precursor </p><p>chemicals, took effect in January 2003. Phase II of the </p><p>regulations, focusing on domestic transactions in precursor </p><p>chemicals, went into effect July 7, 2003. Bouchard noted that </p><p>under the regulations, the GoC has authority to inspect </p><p>licensed chemical facilities if there is evidence diversions </p><p>are taking place; however, compliance by Canada\'s drug </p><p>importers and manufacturers remains voluntary. She indicated </p><p>Health Canada hopes to obtain additional financial resources </p><p>to carry out further inspections at production facilities. </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) Richard Viau, Director of Canada\'s Drug Analysis </p><p>Service, took issue with U.S. concerns about the increased </p><p>potency of marijuana grown in Canada. Viau said a lab at </p><p>Health Canada regularly measures the potency of marijuana </p><p>seized by law enforcement officers for use in criminal </p><p>trials, and presented a detailed graph reflecting the potency </p><p>of marijuana seized in recent years. Viau indicated the </p><p>majority of the marijuana tested at Health Canada contains </p><p>THC levels averaging 10%; they see very little marijuana </p><p>exceeding a 20% THC level. He acknowledged Canadian growers </p><p>are becoming smarter in terms of choosing the best species, </p><p>methods of cultivation, and the optimal time for harvesting </p><p>the plant. Dr. Crane said he would like to study Dr. Viau\'s </p><p>data more closely. </p><p> </p><p>11.(C) Justice Canada - Dr. Crane met Paul Saint-Denis and </p><p>Donald Piragoff, senior counsels in the Criminal Law Policy </p><p>Section.  Piragoff stated the problem for GoC is that the </p><p>current marijuana law is not respected. He said police </p><p>officers and prosecutors refuse to pursue cases involving </p><p>small amounts of marijuana, and marijuana users know this. </p><p>Saint-Denis said that under the current law, only one of </p><p>every two possession incidents results in a charge by the </p><p>police (he noted that this statistic does not include the </p><p>province of Quebec). The government believes, therefore, that </p><p>decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana </p><p>will free up law enforcement officers and prosecutors so they </p><p>can devote more attention to large suppliers and grow </p><p>operations. The government also believes the proposed </p><p>marijuana law will be more fairly enforced in all areas of </p><p>Canada, as under the present system non-white and rural </p><p>Canadians are more likely than others to be prosecuted for </p><p>marijuana possession. </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) Saint-Denis noted the percentage of persons using </p><p>marijuana in Canada has increased each year for the past 10 </p><p>years. He said the government wants an enforcement mechanism </p><p>and penalty that will work. Under the government\'s cannabis </p><p>reform law, as it is now written, persons found in possession </p><p>of up to 15 grams of marijuana will be given a ticket and </p><p>required to pay a fine, similar to traffic or other health </p><p>and safety violations. If the violator is a minor, parental </p><p>notification will be required. Piragoff cited the example of </p><p>Australia, where enforcement of the marijuana law increased </p><p>significantly after it was revised to permit tickets and </p><p>fines for persons possessing small amounts. Saint-Denis </p><p>suggested that by notifying parents of marijuana violations, </p><p>adults would be encouraged if not forced to take a more </p><p>active role in educating their young. He said he expects C-38 </p><p>(the cannabis reform bill) to fully complete the </p><p>parliamentary process before the end of the year. (Comment: </p><p>Post believes Saint-Denis </p><p>  and Piragoff were the principal drafters of C-38. End </p><p>comment.) </p><p> </p><p>13.(C) Solicitor General Canada - Dr. Crane met with a large </p><p>group of officials at the Department of the Solicitor </p><p>General, including Christine Miles, Director General, </p><p>Policing and Law Enforcement; Anita Dagenais, Acting Director </p><p>of Hemispheric Cooperation; Policy Analyst Lyndon Murdock; </p><p>and Superintendent Mike Gaudreau, Director of the Drug Branch </p><p>of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Miles directed the </p><p>presentation, which repeated Health Canada\'s message that </p><p>Canada views its drug abuse problem primarily as a health </p><p>issue, and that attention and resources should be focused on </p><p>that aspect of the drug problem. She said law enforcement </p><p>does play an essential role not only in supply reduction, but </p><p>also in educating the Canadian public of the harm drugs can </p><p>cause (citing the DARE program as an example of an </p><p>educational program led by law enforcement). Miles noted </p><p>proudly that the counter-narcotics budget for Canadian law </p><p>enforcement will increase incrementally over the next five </p><p>years. She admitted, however, th </p><p>at there is much to be learned in the law enforcement area, </p><p>for example, how to assess impaired driving caused by </p><p>marijuana use. </p><p> </p><p>14.(C) Mills stated that Canada looks forward to assuming the </p><p>chairmanship of CICAD (Inter-American Drug Abuse Control </p><p>Commission) in Montreal in November, and welcomed </p><p>opportunities to make the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism </p><p>stronger. Mills said the Office of Solicitor General is </p><p>encouraged by the progress made in addressing Canada\'s </p><p>precursor chemical diversion problem through the enactment of </p><p>new regulations, and that Canada\'s pharmaceutical companies </p><p>are cooperating.  She noted, however, that more needs to be </p><p>done and that, at present, it is difficult to measure the </p><p>success of the new regulations because there "just has not </p><p>been enough time." (Comment: when asked specifically if RCMP </p><p>has been able to initiate prosecutions or make arrests for </p><p>any precursor chemical diversions since the first of this </p><p>year, Gaudreau said no, there have been no arrests or </p><p>prosecutions under the new regulations. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>15.(C) Canadian grow operations were also discussed during </p><p>this meeting. Gaudreau indicated the Royal Canadian Mounted </p><p>Police (RCMP) is beginning to work with the Canadian </p><p>Association of Chiefs of Police to develop a more coordinated </p><p>approach to going after "grow ops". According to Policy </p><p>Analyst Lyndon Murdock, this is the first time federal and </p><p>provincial law enforcement have had a shared focus on grow </p><p>ops. In the past, the RCMP often had to struggle with the </p><p>attitudes of local law enforcement, which did not look on </p><p>marijuana offenses as a priority. Gaudreau said the RCMP </p><p>intends to utilize the additional resources and officers it </p><p>will receive, as part of the renewed national drug strategy, </p><p>to pursue the organized crime elements which operate grow </p><p>houses. Gaudreau commented, however, that the RCMP might not </p><p>actually receive funding for new operations until early 2004. </p><p>(Comment: DEA Ottawa\'s RCMP sources have indicated that RCMP </p><p>has decreased the number of its drug-dedicated units this </p><p>year. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.(C) It was noted that, under the government\'s cannabis </p><p>reform bill, the maximum prison sentence for conducting a </p><p>grow operation will increase from 7 to 14 years. When asked </p><p>if mandatory minimum sentences had been considered by the </p><p>government, Miles commented that Canada takes a different </p><p>view of incarceration than the U.S. Miles said it is not the </p><p>"Canadian way" to impose mandatory minimum sentences, as the </p><p>purpose for incarcerating an offender is rehabilitation, not </p><p>punishment. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>A Different View on Parliament Hill </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.(C) Parliament Hill - During a lunch meeting on Parliament </p><p>Hill, members of Parliament had a frank exchange of views </p><p>with Dr. Crane, primarily on C-38. The members present at the </p><p>meeting either have serious reservations about C-38, or are </p><p>outright opponents of it. MP Dan McTeague, the leader of the </p><p>Liberal opponents of C-38, presented a detailed critique of </p><p>the bill. Several members expressed their concern that the </p><p>House leadership will try to push the bill through, </p><p>regardless of the possible consequences for members from more </p><p>conservative ridings. The members also voiced concern about </p><p>the negative impact decriminalization might have on U.S. - </p><p>Canada relations, and expressed a desire for Dr. Crane and </p><p>other U.S. officials to become involved in the marijuana </p><p>debate. Senator Anne Cools raised the possibility of inviting </p><p>a U.S. drug control official to testify about </p><p>decriminalization at a hearing, and several of the House </p><p>members present expressed interest in this idea. (Comment: </p><p>The House of Commons is now i </p><p>n recess and will not reconvene until September.  It is </p><p>uncertain, particularly in light of Prime Minister Chretien\'s </p><p>lame duck status, how hard the government intends to push </p><p>C-38 when the House reconvenes. But the bill cannot be </p><p>declared dead yet. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Navigating the Road Ahead </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.(C) Dr. Crane\'s tour d\'horizon among Canadian government </p><p>officials was informative and useful.  He made clear </p><p>throughout the day that the USG is concerned about the flow </p><p>into the U.S. of Canadian-produced marijuana and diverted </p><p>precursor chemicals, and highlighted that the U.S. must, and </p><p>will, act to stem that flow - for the sake of our children </p><p>and our future. His Canadian interlocutors echoed their </p><p>concerns about the impact that drug abuse, whether of </p><p>marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or alcohol and tobacco, has on </p><p>Canadian children and society at large. However, the Canadian </p><p>officials also emphasized that they intend to address their </p><p>drug demand and supply issues in a way that conforms to their </p><p>style of problem solving. They made it clear that while they </p><p>will listen to U.S. experts and do want to learn from our </p><p>experiences, they will not be lectured to, or forced to take </p><p>measures (including abandoning Canadian initiatives) because </p><p>Washington says so. In this atmosphere, post believes Crane\'s </p><p>presentations str </p><p>uck the right balance between learning and teaching. </p><p>Undertaking research studies is all well and good; however, </p><p>post questions the utility of waiting a year or more to </p><p>complete an academic analysis of a problem when the harmful </p><p>effects of that problem are being experienced now. We suggest </p><p>Canada does not see that the wolf is at the door. </p><p> </p><p>19.(C) We clearly have an uphill battle in front of us. </p><p>Though post thought (perhaps wishfully) that the GoC\'s </p><p>marijuana decriminalization bill had died when the House </p><p>recessed in late June, the bill may well be revived in the </p><p>fall as part of Prime Minister Chretien\'s final push for a </p><p>legacy. The self-selected Liberal Party back-benchers who met </p><p>with Dr. Crane are clearly concerned their Party\'s leadership </p><p>may choose to force C-38 through the House. While Dr. Crane </p><p>said, loudly and clearly, that the U.S. respects Canada\'s </p><p>right to make its own legislative choices, the pleading of </p><p>these MPs for Washington intervention was startling.  They </p><p>obviously feel powerless to oppose their leadership. This </p><p>leads us to wonder whether others, even more influential in </p><p>the Party structure, would pay heed to their constituents if </p><p>the Canadian public at large voices opposition to the </p><p>government\'s decriminalization plan. </p><p> </p><p>20.(C) The Canadian approach to the precursor chemical </p><p>diversion problem may be just as worrisome, albeit less </p><p>openly debated. Keeping in mind that U.S. chemical diversion </p><p>regulations and procedures took years to develop and refine, </p><p>we appreciate that 6 months of a new regime is too short a </p><p>time to prove the success of Canada\'s regulations. We regret, </p><p>however, that Canadian authorities have declined offers of </p><p>assistance from U.S. experts on the development of such </p><p>regulations, a decision that could cost the Canadians many </p><p>man-years of valuable lessons learned. </p><p> </p><p>21.(C) Yes, the Canadians will do it their way and we hope </p><p>they will succeed. Perhaps the best way we can help is to </p><p>remain consistent in our message:  we stand ready to help, </p><p>but in the end the U.S. government will do what it must to </p><p>stem the flow of drugs that are produced in or transit Canada </p><p>from crossing the U.S. border. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
