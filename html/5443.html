<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 000822 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S $3.3 BILLION DEBT SERVICE ON FEB. 5; </p><p>TREASURY\'S REVISED INTEREST RATE PROJECTIONS FOR 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 752 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Turkish Treasury released its February Domestic Debt </p><p>Service schedule on January 31, showing a monthly total of TL </p><p>6.8 quadrillion ($4.1 billion), of which TL 5.6 quadrillion </p><p>is to be paid on February 5. Given the ten-day holiday in the </p><p>middle of the month, during which another TL 0.8 quadrillion </p><p>is due, the entire borrowing burden for the month falls in </p><p>the first week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Treasury\'s goal is to raise at least TL 4.5 </p><p>quadrillion (about $2.8 billion) in T-bill auctions on </p><p>February 4, according to  Deputy DG Volkan Taskin.  He told </p><p>us this is the minimum amount needed.   Other sources that </p><p>will be tapped to meet February debt service include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- External borrowing of $350 million announced on January 31 </p><p>(a re-opening of the 2008 maturity dollar bond launched </p><p>November 7). </p><p>-- Treasury\'s cash account, currently at TL 5.2 quadrillion </p><p>(though much of this is needed to pay GOT salaries and make </p><p>external debt service payments in February). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Volkan also provided Treasury\'s latest projections </p><p>for 2003 domestic borrowing, after the January 28 Higher </p><p>Planning Council decisions on 2003 budget aggregates </p><p>(reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Average nominal interest rate on fixed rate lira </p><p>T-bills:  43 percent. </p><p>--  Market roll-over rate:  93 percent; </p><p>total roll-over rate: 87 percent. </p><p>--  Average maturity of new fixed rate T-bills: 8 months. </p><p>--  Assumptions: $4.5 billion in Eurobonds; $1.7 billion in </p><p>IMF disbursements.  U.S. bilateral aid not assumed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Taskin said Treasury has told the GOT that to get </p><p>the 43 percent average interest rate over 2003 will require </p><p>full implementation of the IMF program, and good timing on </p><p>the Iraq crisis.  Treasury expects interest rates to decline </p><p>after the Iraq crisis, but to stay at current levels or even </p><p>higher until then.  To get the sharp declines needed after </p><p>Iraq, the GOT needs to have its economic reform policies in </p><p>order, per Taskin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment:  One potential problem for the February 4 </p><p>t-bill auctions will be the February 3 release of January </p><p>inflation data - some market analysts are predicting CPI to </p><p>come in very high, in the 3-4 percent range. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
