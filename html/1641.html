IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE, IN A ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING </p><p>CORPORATION (ZBC) TELEVISION INTERVIEW THE NIGHT OF </p><p>APRIL 17, AND THEN AGAIN IN HIS SPEECH AT THE OFFICIAL </p><p>INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATIONS IN HARARE ON APRIL 18, </p><p>REPEATEDLY CRITICIZED BRITAIN AND WHITE ZIMBABWEANS FOR </p><p>BEING THE PRINCIPLE CAUSES OF ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT </p><p>ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  MOST OF THIS CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>BRITISH AND WHITES CENTERED ON THE LAND ISSUE, BUT HE </p><p>ALSO AGAIN ATTACKED THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) FOR MERELY BEING A FRONT FOR </p><p>WHITES.  HE CONFIRMED THAT HE WILL BE THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>AFRICAN NATIONAL UNION - PATRIOTIC FRONT (ZANU-PF) </p><p>CANDIDATE IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND </p><p>WILL ONLY RETIRE WHEN HE IS SURE THAT ZANU-PF HAS A </p><p>SECURE HOLD ON POWER.  MUGABE ALSO THREATENED THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) WILL TAKE OVER COMPANIES </p><p>THAT ATTEMPT TO SHUTDOWN OPERATIONS WITHOUT "GENUINE </p><p>REASONS", ALLEGING THESE COMPANIES COMPLICITY IN </p><p>FRUSTRATING THE "FAST-TRACK" LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM. </p><p>WE SEE THIS THREAT AS A HARBINGER OF MORE URBAN VIOLENCE </p><p>TO COME.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01354  01 OF 03  191450Z </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>THE BRITISH ARE TO BLAME </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OCCASIONS IN BOTH THE </p><p>TELEVISION INTERVIEW AND DURING HIS SPEECH PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE CASTIGATED THE BRITISH FOR INTERFERING IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND SEEKING TO TURN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AGAINST ZIMBABWE.  THE FOCUS OF </p><p>HIS ATTACK AGAINST THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REVOLVED </p><p>AROUND THE LAND ISSUE, AND HIS BELIEF THAT THE BRITISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT RENEGED ON ITS COMMITMENT TO PAY FOR LAND </p><p>REFORM IN ZIMBABWE.  HE CRITICIZED THE BRITISH LABOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AND PRIME MINISTER BLAIR, BY NAME ON </p><p>NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, AND ALLEGED THAT "BRITAIN WAS </p><p>BEHAVING LIKE AN INTERNATIONAL DELINQUENT ON THE </p><p>MATTER."  HE WENT ON TO ARGUE THAT THOSE COUNTRIES THAT </p><p>SUPPORT THE BRITISH POSITION NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS A SOVEREIGN STATE AND THAT IT SHOULD BE </p><p>ASSISTED WITH THE PROGRAMS IT DEVELOPS WITHOUT </p><p>INTERFERENCE FROM ANY SOURCE.  REVEALING HIS OBSESSION </p><p>WITH THE INDEPENDENCE STRUGGLE, DURING HIS INDEPENDENCE </p><p>DAY SPEECH HE SAID, "THIS LAND, THIS ZIMBABWE, IS A </p><p>SACRED INHERITANCE FROM OUR FOREFATHERS.  IT WAS THE </p><p>\'CASUS BELLI\' OF OUR ARMED NATIONAL LIBERATION STRUGGLE. </p><p>IT CANNOT, THEREFORE, BE THAT WHICH WE HAVE TO BEG A </p><p>FOREIGN POWER FOR AND SO WE SAY HANDS OFF, BRITAIN, </p><p>HANDS OFF, BRITAIN!"  HE WENT ON TO SHOUT, "WE ARE NOT </p><p>AN EXTENSION OF BRITAIN.  SO MR. BLAIR HANDS OFF, </p><p>PLEASE!"  TOWARDS THE END OF THE TELEVISION INTERVIEW, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01354  01 OF 03  191450Z </p><p>MUGABE STATED THAT "LOOKING BACK 21 YEARS THE GREATEST </p><p>MOMENT IN MY LIFE WAS SEEING THE BRITISH FLAG GO DOWN </p><p>AND REPLACED BY THE FLAG OF THE NEW NATION OF ZIMBABWE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>AND SO ARE THE WHITES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) MUGABE CONTINUED HIS VITRIOLIC ATTACKS ON WHITE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS IN BOTH THE TELEVISION INTERVIEW AND </p><p>INDEPENDENCE DAY SPEECH.  HE CRITICIZED THE WHITES FOR </p><p>HAVING SPURNED THE HAND OF RECONCILIATION HE HAD </p><p>EXTENDED AT INDEPENDENCE, SAYING "RECONCILIATION WAS NOT </p><p>A ONE-SIDED AFFAIR.  THE WHITES HAD NOT BEEN FORTHCOMING </p><p>AND BEHAVED AS IF THEY BELONGED TO BRITAIN AND WERE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE ONLY TO MAKE MONEY."  HE CONTINUED THAT, "THE </p><p>WHITES WANTED TO REVERSE THE GAINS ATTAINED AT </p><p>INDEPENDENCE BY OPPOSING THE \'FAST-TRACK\' LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM."  AS HE OFTEN DOES, HE REFERRED NUMEROUS TIMES </p><p>TO WHITE ZIMBABWEANS, THE MAJORITY OF WHOM WERE BORN IN </p><p>THIS COUNTRY, AS "SETTLERS."  ACCORDING TO MUGABE, "THE </p><p>SETTLERS ARE USING EVERY TRICK, INCLUDING THAT OF USING </p><p>SOME AMONG US, TO DERAIL THE EFFORT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>ALLOW AN EQUITABLE REDISTRIBUTION OF LAND." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0658 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01354  02 OF 03  191450Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SS-00    STR-00   USIE-00 </p><p>      BBG-00   IIP-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------E171E3  191451Z /38 </p><p>R 191447Z APR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8668 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 001354 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER AND AFR/SA - CPALMA AND </p><p> </p><p>NNEWMAN </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/19/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, PINR, ZI, UK </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE ANNOUNCES RE-ELECTION BID AND LASHES OUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01354  02 OF 03  191450Z </p><p>AT THE BRITISH AND WHITE ZIMBABWEANS WHILE MARKING </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S 21ST INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>THE WHITES BEHIND THE MDC </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) IN THE TELEVISION INTERVIEW MUGABE CRITICIZED THE </p><p>MDC AS BEING JUST A FRONT FOR WHITES, SAYING THAT THE </p><p>"MDC HAD MADE A MISTAKE BY PUTTING WHITES IN THE </p><p>FOREFRONT."  HE LINKED THIS ALLEGED DOMINATION OF THE </p><p>MDC BY WHITES AS EVIDENCE OF THE CONSPIRACY TO RETURN </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO WHITE MINORITY RULE, STATING "IT INVOKES IN </p><p>ALL OF US A BELIEF THAT THE WHITE MAN DOES NOT CHANGE. </p><p>AS LONG AS THE WHITES DID NOT CHANGE, PEOPLE SHOULD </p><p>STRENGTHEN THEMSELVES TO FIGHT EVEN HARDER."  IN HIS </p><p>INDEPENDENCE DAY SPEECH HE STATED "LET US WATCH OUT FOR </p><p>THESE VICIOUS ENEMIES AMONG US AND TRY TO OVERCOME </p><p>THEM", CLEARLY A REFERENCE TO BOTH THE MDC AND </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S WHITE MINORITY AND THEIR OSTENSIBLY VIOLENT </p><p>AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>MUGABE WILL RUN AGAIN </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) MUGABE PUBLICLY CONFIRMED FOR THE FIRST TIME </p><p>SINCE THE ZANU-PF PARTY CONGRESS LAST FEBRUARY THAT HE </p><p>WILL BE THE PARTY\'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

(U) IN BOTH THE TELEVISON INTERVIEW AND THE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE DAY SPEECH MUGABE THREATENED THAT THE GOZ </p><p>WILL TAKE OVER THE OPERATIONS OF ANY COMPANIES THAT TRY </p><p>TO SHUTDOWN OPERATIONS WITHOUT GOZ APPROVAL.  HE </p><p>ASSERTED THAT MANY OF THESE COMPANY CLOSURES DID NOT </p><p>RESULT FROM THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE IN ZIMBABWE, BUT WERE </p><p>BEING DONE AS PART OF THE BRITISH AND WHITE ZIMBABWEANS\' </p><p>CAMPAIGN TO FRUSTRATE THE "FAST-TRACK" LAND PROGRAM.  HE </p><p>STATED THAT "GOVERNMENT WILL IN THE FUTURE NOT ALLOW ANY </p><p>VIABLE MINING OR MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISE TO CLOSE FOR </p><p>UNCLEAR REASONS.  ANY CLOSURES WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE </p><p>ASSENT OF THE GOVERNMENT." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S TELEVISION INTERVIEW, AND </p><p>INDEPENDENCE DAY SPEECH AT THE HALF-FILLED NATIONAL </p><p>STADIUM (WHERE A SOCCER MATCH BETWEEN RIVAL TEAMS </p><p>HIGHLANDERS AND DYNAMOS THAT AFTERNOON WAS LIKELY THE </p><p>BIGGER DRAW), CONFIRMED THAT HE IS A LEADER TRAPPED IN </p><p>THE TIME WARP OF ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE STRUGGLE AND </p><p>HIS PERCEIVED GLORY DAYS.  THE FACT THAT HIS "FAST- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01354  02 OF 03  191450Z </p><p>TRACK" LAND REFORM PROGRAM WILL BE THE ISSUE ON WHICH HE </p><p>WILL RUN HIS 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN WAS </p><p>EVIDENCED BY THE CENTRAL ROLE IT PLAYED IN THE INTERVIEW </p><p>AND THE SPEECH.  IN REALITY, THIS IS THE ONLY ISSUE </p><p>MUGABE AND ZANU-PF CAN USE TO TRY AND GARNER SUPPORT </p><p>FROM THE ZIMBABWE PEOPLE.  HE MENTIONED THE TREMENDOUS </p><p>STRIDES THAT ZIMBABWE HAD MADE SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN THE </p><p>FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE, BUT THE COLD-HARD </p><p>TRUTH IS THAT BOTH THE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND PUBLIC </p><p>HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ARE ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE. </p><p>INDEED, A TWENTY-ONE MINUTE POWER FAILURE AT THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE INDEPENDENCE DAY CEREMONIES WAS ALMOST </p><p>A LITERARY TROPE: A PATHETIC FALLACY TO ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>REACHING THE AGE OF MAJORITY UNDER MUGABE\'S LEADERSHIP. </p><p>LASTLY, MUGABE\'S BIZARRE AND PROBABLY UNENFORCEABLE </p><p>THREAT TO PREVENT COMPANIES FROM SHUTTING DOWN, ALLEGING </p><p>THEY ARE DOING SO JUST TO FRUSTRATE LAND REFORM, </p><p>PORTENDS MORE URBAN VIOLENCE TO US.  WE SEE ZANU-PF </p><p>DEPLOYING WAR VETERANS IN EVEN GREATER NUMBERS TO FORCE </p><p>OWNERS OF FALTERING FACTORIES AND OTHER BUSINESSES TO </p><p>REMAIN OPEN THROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL INTIMIDATION AND THE </p><p>OCCASIONAL VICIOUS BEATING.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS WILL </p><p>NOT HELP THE ZIMBABWE ECONOMY TO IMPROVE NOR RESTORE </p><p>INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.
