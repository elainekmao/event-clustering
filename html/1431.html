<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KINSHASA 008417 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/11/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: GDRC ANNOUNCES LIBREVILLE PARTICIPANTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. LIBREVILLE 2335 </p><p>     B. KINSHASA 8382 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF JONATHAN PRATT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) WITH BOLD HEADLINES, KINSHASA NEWSPAPERS ANNOUNCED </p><p>DECEMBER 19 THE GDRC LIST OF PARTICIPANTS FOR THE </p><p>"PRE-DIALOGUE" IN LIBREVILLE, PROVIDING THE STRONGEST SIGNAL </p><p>YET THAT THE KABILA GOVERNMENT WILL ATTEND THE DECEMBER 21 </p><p>MEETING IN GABON.  INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER "LA REFERENCE PLUS" </p><p>CALLED THE 201 GDRC-SELECTED PARTICIPANTS "ILLUSTRIOUS </p><p>UNKNOWNS", NOTING THAT NO PROMINENT FIGURES FROM THE </p><p>INTERNAL, EXTERNAL, OR ARMED OPPOSITION PLANNED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE.  PRESIDENT KABILA HAS NOT YET ANNOUNCED WHETHER </p><p>HE WILL ATTEND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE LIST OF 201 NAMES, PRODUCED BY THE CONSTITUENT AND </p><p>LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY\'S SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR THE </p><p>INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE, IS BROKEN INTO REPRESENTATIONAL </p><p>CATEGORIES CLEARLY INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE BREADTH OF </p><p>PARTICIPATION.  SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS INCLUDING FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER OKITUNDU AND EDUCATION MINISTER YERODIA APPEAR IN </p><p>THE CATEGORY TITLED "NATIONAL DIRECTORATE OF THE CPP" </p><p>(PEOPLE\'S POWER COMMITTEES).  THE SMALL SECTION FOR POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES (ONLY SEVEN SPOTS) INCLUDES 5 UNKNOWNS AND TWO </p><p>UN-NAMED UDPS PARTICIPANTS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT UDPS </p><p>ANNOUNCED A BOYCOTT AND EVEN BREAK-AWAY UDPS PRESIDENT </p><p>KIBASSA MALIBA ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULDN\'T ATTEND.  A WHOPPING </p><p>SIXTY PARTICIPANTS WILL REPRESENT CONGOLESE CIVIL SOCIETY, </p><p>BUT AS IN THE POLITICAL PARTIES CATEGORY, NONE OF THE NAMES </p><p>ARE FAMILIAR TO THE EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) PROMINENT OPPOSITION FIGURES CONTINUE TO INSIST </p><p>PUBLICLY THAT THEY WON\'T GO TO LIBREVILLE.  RFI REPORTED </p><p>DECEMBER 19 THAT BOTH UDPS PRESIDENT ETIENNE TSHISEKEDI AND </p><p>FONUS PRESIDENT JOSEPH OLENGHANKOY HAD ANNOUNCED THAT THEY </p><p>PLANNED TO BOYCOTT THE MEETING.  BOTH CITED THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>LIBREVILLE MEETING FELL OUTSIDE OF THE LUSAKA PROCESS AS </p><p>THEIR JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT ATTENDING.  (NOTE: TSHISEKEDI IS </p><p>REPORTEDLY SPENDING THE WEEK TRAVELING TO AFRICAN CAPITALS </p><p>INCLUDING LOME, LUANDA, KIGALI, KAMPALA, AND HARARE. END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: THIS PROMINENT ANNOUNCEMENT INDICATES THAT </p><p>THE GDRC MAY IN FACT SEND A CONTINGENT TO GABON FOR A </p><p>"PRE-DIALOGUE" MEETING.  HOWEVER, SEVERAL QUESTIONS REMAIN, </p><p>NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS HOW A LARGE GDRC DELEGATION WILL </p><p>TRAVEL TO LIBREVILLE BEFORE THURSDAY.  MORE TO THE POINT, </p><p>OBSERVERS IN KINSHASA WONDER WHY THE DELEGATES WOULD TRAVEL </p><p>ALL THE WAY TO GABON GIVEN THAT NO RECOGNIZABLE MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE OPPOSITION PLAN TO ATTEND, AND OUTSIDE FACILITATION WOULD </p><p>THEREFORE BE OF LITTLE USE. END COMMENT. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
