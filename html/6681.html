EVENTS SINCE LAST SITREP (all reported times are </p><p>Kuwait Local, GMT plus three): </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Security/Military </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>In the past twelve hours, we have had two "duck-and- </p><p>cover" alerts in response to reported launches of </p><p>surface-to-surface missiles from Iraq.  The most recent </p><p>was at approximately 2326.  No/no reports of damage </p><p>or casualties, nor any indication of chemical or </p><p>biological warheads were reported. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Political </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>The Kuwaiti MFA contacted the Ops Center to confirm the legitimacy </p><p>of visa applications being made in their London Embassy on behalf </p><p>of ORHA.  Working with Kuwait Desk Officer and ORHA team members </p><p>in Kuwaiti, Ops Officer was able to confirm the applications were </p><p>legitimate and pass this information to the MFA. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Consular </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>The remaining stranded Amcit passengers reported earlier have </p><p>departed Kuwait on Kuwait Airways for Chicago via London this </p><p>afternoon. </p><p> </p><p>Fourteen Amcits have requested Embassy assistance to depart from </p><p>Kuwait.  While the majority have requested assistance in obtaining </p><p>flight reservations, four have requested assistance with Saudi </p><p>transit visas.  Embassy Consular officers will be assisting these </p><p>Amcits tomorrow a.m.  Embassy Consular officer released Warden </p><p>Notice number 11, which reinforced all previous warnings to </p><p>American citizens living in Kuwait to be vigilant and practice </p><p>good personal safety and security measures.  Kuwait International </p><p>Airport remains open, although most carriers have suspended or </p><p>restricted service.  However, Kuwait Airways is flying at close to </p><p>normal operations. </p><p> </p><p>An Embassy Consular officer and FSN met with Congen Dhahran and </p><p>Kuwaiti border officials at the Kuwaiti/Saudi border today.  The </p><p>Kuwaiti border officials reported that no Americans citizens have </p><p>tried to cross the border since the start of hostilities between </p><p>Iraq and U.S.  Kuwaiti authorities claim that during the past few </p><p>days, approximately 5,000 Arabs/Kuwaitis have crossed the </p><p>Kuwaiti/Saudi border, which is down from a normal of 12,000 people </p><p>on the weekend.  The Consular officer and Congen confirmed that </p><p>the Saudi Embassy in Kuwait will issue gratis "emergency transit </p><p>visas" to American citizens in Kuwait, if the situation </p><p>deteriorated. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Management </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>At the request of TFIZ01, we confirmed through OMC-K that, as of </p><p>1655 only 9 oil fires had been set by Iraqi forces at the Rumalya </p><p>oil/gas separation facility; 2 of the 9 were extinguished by </p><p>civilian contractors moving with the 1st Marine Expeditionary </p><p>Force (1MEF) in Southern Iraq.  This contradicts a CNN report that </p><p>fifteen oil fires were burning in Rumalya. </p><p> </p><p>3. COMMENTS: None </p><p> </p><p>4.
