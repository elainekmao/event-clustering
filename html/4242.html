Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Returns of Internally Displaced </p><p>Persons (IDPs) to points of origin in Sri Lanka have </p><p>surged, with a large percentage of the 213,000 total </p><p>returns this year transiting in the past eight weeks </p><p>alone.  Most of the returns are to points in Jaffna, but </p><p>many have returned to the Tiger-controlled Wanni region. </p><p>The upward trend seems closely entwined with growth of </p><p>confidence in the peace process.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) There has been a surge in returns of IDPs to </p><p>their points of origin in Sri Lanka.  From early </p><p>September to November 1, there have been 86,000 IDP </p><p>returnees, according to UNHCR.  Before September, there </p><p>had been 127,000 returns since the year began.  The </p><p>grand total for 2002 is 213,000.  UNHCR reports that it </p><p>expects the numbers of returns to climb significantly </p><p>further in November. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) More than half of the returnees have transited </p><p>to points in Jaffna District.  About a third of the </p><p>returnees have gone to points in Mullaitivu and </p><p>Kilinochchi Districts, which are under the control of </p><p>the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  A much </p><p>smaller group of returnees has gone back to Mannar </p><p>District in the north and Trincomalee District in the </p><p>east, which are both under a patchwork of government and </p><p>LTTE control. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) UNHCR reports that there remain about 600,000 </p><p>IDPs in Sri Lanka.  Most of these are in camps scattered </p><p>throughout the country, but some are staying with family </p><p>members.  Most IDPs are Tamils, as are the vast majority </p><p>of returnees.  Very few of the Muslim IDPs ejected from </p><p>Jaffna in the early 1990s by the LTTE have returned. </p><p>UNHCR also reports that only a small handful of the </p><p>approximately 100,000 refugees in India have returned. </p><p>In addition, there is no sign that large numbers of the </p><p>estimated 750,000 Tamil expatriates who left since the </p><p>war began in 1983 have returned.  (Note:  Many of these </p><p>Tamils settled in Canada, Australia, the UK, and </p><p>elsewhere in Europe.  A good percentage are </p><p>professionals.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The recent surge in returns seems directly </p><p>linked with positive news on the peace track. </p><p>Commenting along such lines, N. Raviraj, a Tamil </p><p>National Alliance (TNA) MP from Jaffna, told us that the </p><p>returnees he has met have expressed optimism that the </p><p>peace process was here to stay.  (Note:  Raviraj\'s war- </p><p>torn home area of Chavakachcheri has received many </p><p>returnees.)  This sense of optimism has sharply </p><p>increased with the start of peace talks between the </p><p>government and the LTTE in mid-September.  Raviraj said </p><p>he expected that the returns would continue to grow </p><p>given the positive coverage generated by the second </p><p>session of peace talks (See Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Queried about the large number of returns to </p><p>LTTE areas, Raviraj noted that the choice of many </p><p>returnees to go there probably had to do with the growth </p><p>of confidence in the ongoing ceasefire.  (Note:  Areas </p><p>now controlled by the LTTE in the north were the site of </p><p>frequent and often large-scale fighting.)  He did not </p><p>think it had anything to do with a spurt in support for </p><p>the LTTE.  Raviraj related that the LTTE was trying to </p><p>be as helpful as possible to the returnees by offering </p><p>them some assistance, as well as land to farm.  He </p><p>noted, however, that many of the returnees were very </p><p>poor, barely scratching out an existence. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  The UNHCR has classified the vast </p><p>majority of the returnees as "spontaneous," i.e., they </p><p>just got up and left without much in the way of support </p><p>from the government or anyone else.  The UNHCR, in fact, </p><p>has basically advised IDPs to stay put until more </p><p>landmines are pulled from the ground and the peace </p><p>process creates an even more settled situation.  The </p><p>fact that the returnees are going back under such </p><p>conditions -- and despite the UN\'s advice -- is a sign </p><p>of the high degree of enthusiasm the peace process has </p><p>stimulated.  Further progress on the peace track could </p><p>trigger a veritable stampede of returnees.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
