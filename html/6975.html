O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EMIN, ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: No Coal/No Power </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 79 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Aged machinery at Zimbabwe\'s coal miner </p><p>constrains output and, ultimately, domestic energy </p><p>generation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. In January we reported that most of Wankie\'s haulers, </p><p>dump trucks, rope shovels and front-end loaders were </p><p>grounded, causing the strategic company to undersupply </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s largest power station (ref).  The Operations </p><p>Manager at Barzem, Zimbabwe\'s sole Caterpillar dealer, </p><p>provides further insight.  Caterpillar machines at Wankie </p><p>are already 20-23 years old.  The Barzem rep complained </p><p>that mechanics have been "patching up" machines that </p><p>Wankie should long since have retired.  In spite of the </p><p>tough business climate, the rep has reluctantly turned </p><p>down new repair orders from Wankie.  He said his company </p><p>could no longer take responsibility for fixes to </p><p>antiquated equipment.  Even when machines are operable, </p><p>their outdated technology causes Wankie to overpay for </p><p>each ton of extracted coal (by 2003 standards), making </p><p>the miner less competitive. </p><p> </p><p>3. Comment: As a critical cog in Zimbabwe\'s economy, </p><p>Wankie bears watching.  Hwange Power\'s low output, due to </p><p>erratic coal supplies, heightens Zimbabwe\'s dependence on </p><p>unaffordable imported South African and Mozambican </p><p>energy.  Parastatal ZESA is increasingly rationing energy </p><p>(load-shedding), a consequence of Wankie\'s inability to </p><p>pay for updated machinery.  Undeniably, the </p><p>infrastructure that underpins Zimbabwe\'s once-enviable </p><p>economy is crumbling. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
