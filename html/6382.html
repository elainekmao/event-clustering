<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0075 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MARCH 13, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for </p><p>March 13, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Milliyet/Dunya: It is reported that the UN is </p><p>also going to establish a humanitarian assistance </p><p>center in Mardin, and relief items to be sent by </p><p>the will be distributed from Mardin. Officials </p><p>announced they had initially considered </p><p>Gaziantep, but because of the distances involved </p><p>preferred Mardin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Radikal/Sabah/Dunya/Cumhuriyet/Hurriyet: </p><p>Around 100 Turkish Communist Party members </p><p>shouting slogans tried to enter the Iskenderun </p><p>port. Soldiers and policemen intervened. When the </p><p>protesters resisted, the soldiers fired warning </p><p>shots in the air, and the port was put on alarm. </p><p>As the demonstrators persisted, the military </p><p>commander drew his soldiers back. Police </p><p>reinforcements tried to disperse the group with </p><p>their clubs. American soldiers who came to the </p><p>gate were kept back from the gate by Turkish </p><p>military officers.  All the demonstrators were </p><p>taken to the police station in Iskenderun, and </p><p>eventually those detained were released by the </p><p>court.  According to Sabah, after the events, CHP </p><p>Hatay Deputy Aziz Yazar visited the Iskenderun </p><p>port\'s facilities.  When he wanted to visit the </p><p>ones hired by the US, he was told that TGS </p><p>permission was required. MP Yazar said "Our ports </p><p>are occupied, and we condemn this situation," and </p><p>claimed that no modernization activities were </p><p>indeed being conducted at the port. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Radikal/Sabah/Evren: Regarding Abdullah </p><p>Ocalan\'s trial at the State Security Court (SSC), </p><p>the European Human Rights Court (EHRC) rendered </p><p>its verdict, saying Turkey had violated the 1st </p><p>and 3rd Paragraphs of Article 6 of the European </p><p>Human Rights Convention. Turkey has been found </p><p>guilty for exceeding the alloed detention period, </p><p>not providing a fair trial, and mistreatment </p><p>(specifically for giving the death penalty to </p><p>Ocalan). The EHRC did not find replacing of the </p><p>military judge with a civilian one sufficient for </p><p>fair trail, and remarked that the defense lawyers </p><p>were not given time and means required for </p><p>defense. The lawyers\' claim that Abdullah Ocalan </p><p>was arrested in, and brought from Kenya, to </p><p>Turkey in an illegal way and thus subjected to </p><p>discrimination was refused by the court. The </p><p>court also announced that there had been no </p><p>violations in Ocalan\'s imprisonment conditions. </p><p>Despite the violations, EHRC did not demand </p><p>Turkey pay any indemnities other than the sum of </p><p>100,000 euros for court\'s expenses. Regarding the </p><p>court\'s decision, Ocalan\'s lawyer, Hasip Kaplan, </p><p>said the infringements of their defense rights </p><p>were obvious, and that he would appeal the </p><p>decision concerning illegal arrest, as well as </p><p>other articles. Turkey, meanwhile, also opposed </p><p>to the court\'s decision, saying it lacked solid </p><p>grounds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Evrensel/Hurriyet: Cukurova University </p><p>students protested US-led war on Iraq by throwing </p><p>eggs at posters of President Bush yesterday. The </p><p>students, who demonstrated in front of the </p><p>Education Faculty, shouted anti-US slogans, </p><p>danced folk dances, and read poems of peace </p><p>versus war. </p><p>5.  Evrensel: Ten students from Gaziantep </p><p>University were detained on charges of pro-KADEK </p><p>activities.  Emine Celebi, a member of the </p><p>Womens\' Flank of DEHAP in Kars, who was arrested </p><p>for saying "No to Isolation (in Prison)" during </p><p>March 8 International Women\'s Day demonstrations, </p><p>was released by the court. </p><p>6.  Bolge: Adana DEHAP\'s weekly "sit-in at Inonu </p><p>Park to protest aainst war and against isolation </p><p>in prisons has turned into a tradition. The </p><p>security forces took away "No to War and </p><p>Isolation" banners carried by DEHAP supporters. </p><p>DEHAP\'s Provincial Chairman, Mehmet Can Celik, </p><p>declared that the seizure of the banners by the </p><p>police was an anti-democratic act, that protestos </p><p>would continue sitting in the park. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Hurriyet: It has been determined that foreign </p><p>media representatives following developments in </p><p>Mersin and Iskenderun ports have given small </p><p>cameras and offered money to truckers to take </p><p>pictures inside the ports. Security officials </p><p>also determined that the foreign reporters have </p><p>offered money to truckers operating between </p><p>Turkey and northern Iraq. Evaluating this </p><p>information, the Foreign Ministry and Turkish </p><p>General Staff (TGS) decided that any reporters </p><p>detected doing so would be deported from Turkey </p><p>immediately and truckers receiving money would be </p><p>severely punished. Some Spanish reporters who </p><p>were given a five-day permission by TGS to </p><p>observe the meeting of the Iraqi Opposition in </p><p>Selahaddin in Northern Iraq but subsequently did </p><p>not return to Turkey will definitely not be </p><p>allowed to reenter Turkey. The Spanish Embassy </p><p>wrote an apology to the Turkey Foreign Ministry, </p><p>but the TGS\'s response was that Turkey was a </p><p>serious country, and the rules were given to the </p><p>reporters earlier, and they would make no </p><p>exception. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Radikal: Ambassador Pearson denied </p><p>allegations that the US had gone beyond the </p><p>permission given within the framework of the </p><p>modernization project for Turkish bases. </p><p>Ambassador Pearson said: "All of our ongoing </p><p>activities are within the framework of the </p><p>permission given for the modernization of the </p><p>bases on February 6. We are behaving honestly and </p><p>carefully." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Sabah: After Mesut Barzani, now Celal </p><p>Talabani has also started sending messages to </p><p>Ankara through the western press. In an exclusive </p><p>interview with the Italian La Repubblica paper, </p><p>Talabani said Turkish soldiers should return to </p><p>Turkey after Saddam\'s regime was ended, and the </p><p>Americans should leave at most one hour after </p><p>their job in Iraq was concluded. In response to </p><p>what would happen if Turkish troops entered </p><p>Northern Iraq alone, Talabani said Turkey could </p><p>enter only in limited numbers to a certain place </p><p>along with the Americans. Talabani said the </p><p>Turkish FM Undersecretary, Ugur Ziyal, guaranteed </p><p>that Turkey would not disarm the peshmergas and </p><p>that the Turkish operation would be for </p><p>humanitarian assistance. When asked if he </p><p>believed Turkey\'s intervention would be limited, </p><p>the Kurdish leader said they were very anxious </p><p>about it but with the US they felt more </p><p>comfortable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Milliyet: The Iraqi Turkomen Front\'s </p><p>representative for Turkey, Mustafa Ziya, claimed </p><p>that the Turkomen were under great threat, and </p><p>that they asked for protection from the UN, the </p><p>US, and Turkey. Mr. Ziya claimed Kurdish groups </p><p>in the region, including the KDP and PUK, had </p><p>secret plans, and would put them into effect the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>moment the war started. He said that the Kurdish </p><p>groups had agreed among themselves to enter </p><p>Kirkuk.  Ziya said the US and Turkey had pledged </p><p>that they would not allow such a thing to happen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Radikal/Dunya: The US and Turkey are </p><p>preparing to receive 600,000 thousand refugees </p><p>who could come to the Turkish border in a war on </p><p>Iraq. The relief that will be provided by the </p><p>United Nations (UN) will be extended to refugees </p><p>on the Iraqi side of the Turkish-Iraqi border. </p><p>The Turkish Red Crescent is already deployed at </p><p>the border. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
