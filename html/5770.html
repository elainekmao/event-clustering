<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000595 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR R, IIP-TERRY SCOTT AND PATRICIA ATKISSON, NEA/PPD- </p><p>MACINNES AND DAVIES, NEA/ARP-KANESHIRO, INR/NESA, LONDON FOR </p><p>KHOURY, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, KISL, OPRC, OIIP, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: EVALUATION: KUWAIT SHARED VALUES SPEAKER HEDIEH </p><p>MIRAHMADI </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 05391 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Dr. Hedieh Mirahmadi, Director of Public Affairs </p><p>for the Supreme Islamic Council of America and member of the </p><p>Council of American Muslim Understanding, visited Kuwait 14- </p><p>15 January in the context of the Department\'s Shared Values </p><p>campaign.  In a series of presentations before audiences </p><p>that ranged from conservative Islamist charities to liberal </p><p>NGOs, Dr. Mirahmadi, a Sunni Muslim, addressed the issue of </p><p>Islam\'s international reputation as a religion of violence </p><p>and intolerance, and the responsibility of Muslims to </p><p>counter the extremist ideologies that give credence to this </p><p>perception. The audience reaction to Dr. Mirahmadi\'s polite </p><p>but straightforward presentations ranged from mannered </p><p>toleration (on the part of one Muslim charity) to angry </p><p>rhetorical outbursts in denunciation of US policy (on the </p><p>part of university students and faculty.) Given the </p><p>importance of her message and the tact with which she </p><p>delivers it, we plan to bring this speaker back to Kuwait in </p><p>the late spring for a more extensive program.  Post </p><p>recommends Dr. Mirahmadi to any post wishing to program on </p><p>this sensitive subject.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Dr. Hedieh Mirahmadi, Director of Public Affairs for the </p><p>Supreme Islamic Council of America and member of the Council </p><p>of American Muslim Understanding, visited Kuwait 14-15 </p><p>January in the context of the Shared Values campaign.  Dr. </p><p>Mirahmadi was a last minute substitute for the subjects of </p><p>the Shared Values video spots that we had managed to get </p><p>broadcast on Kuwait TV during Ramadan, and post was </p><p>accordingly disappointed when these locally-recognized </p><p>speakers were not able to travel to Kuwait as planned. </p><p>Added to our apprehension was the fact that Dr. Mirahmadi, a </p><p>Californian of Iranian extraction, does not speak Arabic and </p><p>was therefore limited in terms of the kinds of audiences she </p><p>could engage.  In retrospect, however, we think Dr. </p><p>Mirahmadi\'s principal message (that extremist religious </p><p>violence threatens Islam\'s future) was of great utility in </p><p>the context of Kuwait\'s current internal debate on the </p><p>growing Islamist influence in the country\'s civil </p><p>institutions. </p><p> </p><p>3. Programs with the leadership of the International Islamic </p><p>Charitable Organization (IIOC) and two women\'s Islamic </p><p>charities (including a program for thirty members of the </p><p>Islamic Care Society) broke new ground for PAS.  These </p><p>meetings touched on the basic themes of tolerance and mutual </p><p>respect that underpin the shared values initiative, and the </p><p>audiences expressed deep interest in Muslim life in the US. </p><p>When our speaker attempted to engage the IIOC leadership on </p><p>a discussion of the issue of "jihad," however, they refused </p><p>to be drawn out, instead repeating that moderation is a good </p><p>thing and that there is "only one Islam."  Our effort to </p><p>move the conversation into the crux of the matter--are </p><p>Muslim organizations like the IIOC willing to put </p><p>politically loaded religious terms like "jihad" and </p><p>"mushrakeen" into a modern context--clearly made them </p><p>uncomfortable, and reinforced our sense that our polite </p><p>reception was for diplomatic purposes only.  This sense was </p><p>reinforced somewhat by a photo spray in their lobby that </p><p>showed dismembered Palestinian corpses, with the caption, </p><p>"Thus is Jewish hatred rendered." </p><p> </p><p>4. Dr. Mirahmadi\'s presentation before Kuwait University\'s </p><p>Mass Communication Department, which includes a number of </p><p>liberally oriented, US-educated staff among its ranks, was </p><p>noteworthy for the highly charged political tone of the </p><p>interaction. The audience was clearly not interested in </p><p>hearing about Muslim life in America, and instead focused on </p><p>a litany of accusations that US policy was biased against </p><p>Muslims.  One student proclaimed, to general approbation, </p><p>that there was no proof Muslims carried out the September 11 </p><p>attacks, and that US actions in Afghanistan effectively </p><p>constituted a "Crusade."  The department faculty joined in </p><p>with a heated attack of the Shared Values program, warning </p><p>that Arabs would not be fooled by such egregious </p><p>propagandizing while martyrs are falling in Palestine. </p><p>(Reftel addresses the issue of Kuwaiti reaction to the </p><p>Shared Values campaign.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  Dr. Mirahmadi responded well to these charges, </p><p>effectively refusing to accept self-victimization and </p><p>captious argumentation as excuses for extremist violence. </p><p>To the charge that there was no proof Muslims were behind </p><p>the September 11 attacks, she replied that the hijackers </p><p>themselves made videotapes claiming responsibility for the </p><p>attacks and declaring that they had done so in the name of </p><p>Islam, and asked her interlocutor if he really believed what </p><p>he was saying.  Regarding the US "crusade" in Afghanistan, </p><p>she reminded her audience that Afghans themselves were happy </p><p>to see the Taliban go, and asked why anyone saw a reason to </p><p>contradict them.  When one angry student accused the US of </p><p>discriminating against Muslims by adopting new visa </p><p>requirements, Dr. Mirahmadi said that if Arab states apply </p><p>harsh and onerous control mechanisms to other Arabs, why </p><p>would anyone fault the US for tightening up a very lax </p><p>immigration system after thousands of its citizens were </p><p>killed? </p><p> </p><p>6. Dr. Mirahmadi\'s visit received wide coverage in Kuwait\'s </p><p>major Arabic-language dailies and major English-language </p><p>daily. She was interviewed live on KTV\'s "Good Morning </p><p>Kuwait." Reportage was positive, focusing on themes of </p><p>moderate Islam and the freedom and tolerance accorded </p><p>Muslims in the U.S.  Sample headlines include: </p><p> </p><p>"`Immigration laws old. enforced after 9/11\'" </p><p> </p><p>"There is Definitely a Future for Islam in America" </p><p> </p><p>"`Muslims sometimes disagree amongst themselves and are </p><p>intolerant of each other\'" </p><p> </p><p>"Dr. Mirahmadi: `It is very sad that terrorism is the </p><p>introduction so many have to our religion\'" </p><p> </p><p>"`We have to portray the true image of Islam as a model for </p><p>tolerance and forgiveness\'" </p><p>> > </p><p>7.  Program Evaluation: Post greatly appreciates the work of </p><p>IIP in bringing Dr. Mirahamdi to Kuwait. IIP/G/NEA-SA </p><p>Terrence Scott and IIP/T/SV Patricia Attkisson (who came to </p><p>Kuwait with this speaker) provided superb guidance and </p><p>support on this program.  > Dr. Mirahmadi\'s credibility as a </p><p>US Muslim leader, her personable manner and > professional </p><p>background (a former corporate litigator who doesn\'t fluster </p><p>easily) were ideally suited to the issue at hand.  We look </p><p>forward to bringing her back to Kuwait during the May/June </p><p>timeframe. </p><p> </p><p>JONES> </p><p>  > </p><p></p></div>
