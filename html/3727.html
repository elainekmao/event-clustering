<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 005267 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, PRM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES IN JORDAN RAMPING UP IRAQ </p><p>PLANNING ACTIVITIES; WARN OF MINIMAL STOCKS IN REGION AND </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF OFF DISRUPTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: GENEVA 3883 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Humanitarian agencies in Jordan have </p><p>stepped up contingency planning efforts for a crisis in Iraq. </p><p> Estimated refugee flows (10,000 into Jordan over six months) </p><p>match those provided reftel, but UN sources admit that they </p><p>are based only on conjecture and, in fact, are purposely </p><p>conservative to bring estimated financial needs into a </p><p>reasonable range.  IOM reports that current UN planning does </p><p>not include repatriation for the up-to 170,000 TCN\'s believed </p><p>to be in Iraq or the 250,000 guest workers throughout the </p><p>region.  UN, ICRC and IFRC representatives warned separately </p><p>that there are no stockpiles of non-food relief supplies in </p><p>the region and that it would take two weeks to move resources </p><p>from other areas.  ICRC and IFRC representatives in Jordan </p><p>(who support programs in Iraq) also warned that disruption of </p><p>the OFF program in Iraq would affect the entire nation\'s food </p><p>supply.  They fear also that Iraq\'s already-weakened water </p><p>and sanitation systems are ill-equipped to handle new </p><p>hostilities or new population flows.  Finally, worst-case </p><p>scenarios in Jordan include the possibility of new refugee </p><p>flows from the West Bank, a scenario UNRWA currently cannot </p><p>handle.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>UNHCR: Worried about Lack of Regional Stockpiles and Thin </p><p>Staffing </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) As reported reftel, UNHCR has lead responsibility for </p><p>contingency planning in the region, and would be responsible </p><p>for its usual refugee registration and protection function </p><p>should a crisis begin in Iraq.  Current UNHCR planning </p><p>reflects a likely initial refugee flow of 3,000 into Jordan, </p><p>with a total flow of 10,000 refugees over six months.  (These </p><p>figures do not include the up-to 100,000 third-country </p><p>nationals that IOM believes may seek repatriation from Iraq </p><p>through Jordan.  See para 7 for details.)  However, UNHCR </p><p>Representative Sten Bronee admitted that these figures are </p><p>based only on conjecture and, in fact, are purposely </p><p>conservative to bring projected financial needs into a </p><p>reasonable range.  Bronee said UNHCR\'s budget, submitted to </p><p>UNHCR/Geneva for inclusion in a region-wide humanitarian </p><p>action response plan, includes USD 90,000 to preposition </p><p>non-food supplies for the initial refugee flow, plus an </p><p>additional USD 385,000 to care for the 10,000 refugees </p><p>expected over six months.  These figures were developed in </p><p>coordination with UNHCR\'s technical assessment team, </p><p>currently touring the region in an effort to finalize </p><p>projected contingency needs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) UNHCR Inspector General Maureen Connelly, in Jordan </p><p>as part of a larger regional tour, told Charge September 10 </p><p>that UNHCR currently has no/no stocks in the region, severely </p><p>hampering its ability to respond to a crisis.  According to </p><p>Connelly, UNHCR lacks basics such as tents, blankets, cooking </p><p>kits, water purification kits, sanitation kits and vehicles </p><p>-- essential items that the UN cannot stockpile under current </p><p>limited funding.  Connelly said she also is worried about the </p><p>ability of UNHCR\'s already thinly stretched staff to respond </p><p>to a crisis.  Jordan Representative Bronee, for example, will </p><p>be in Sudan on a two-month mission, leaving the Senior </p><p>Protection Officer as the only full-time international </p><p>employee at UNHCR/Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Connelly also told the Charge UNHCR is worried about </p><p>the GOJ\'s reluctance to engage in detailed planning </p><p>discussions with the UN.  UNHCR/Jordan Representative Bronee </p><p>had told us earlier that planning discussions with the GOJ </p><p>are based on the GOJ\'s oft-stated public position that its </p><p>borders are closed.  Bronee said that while he appreciates </p><p>the GOJ\'s difficult political position, its reluctance to </p><p>engage even in quiet, low-level discussions with the UN about </p><p>practicalities such as water supply or warehousing </p><p>capabilities is hampering the UN\'s planning efforts.  Without </p><p>such discussions, UNHCR fears that it will face a scenario of </p><p>Iraqi refugees stranded in the desert without access to food, </p><p>shelter or water.  (Comment:  We are addressing this issue </p><p>with the GOJ.) </p><p> </p><p>WFP:  13,000 Tons of Wheat on-Hand </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) According to WFP Representative Marwan Kokash, the </p><p>World Food Program currently has 13,000 tons of wheat in its </p><p>Jordan warehouses.  Of that amount, 4,000 tons are to be </p><p>turned over to the GOJ to replenish stocks lent to WFP when a </p><p>previous shipment was delayed.  The remaining 9,000 tons will </p><p>be used in WFP\'s regular Jordan development programs and are </p><p>intended to keep these programs running through September </p><p>2003.  In addition, WFP has contracted with ICRC to import </p><p>through Jordan 6,000 tons of wheat for the ICRC\'s West Bank </p><p>rural food distribution programs.  ICRC Delegate Guy Mellet </p><p>told refcoord that ICRC contingency planning calls for </p><p>diversion of this wheat to Iraq, if necessary.  The wheat is </p><p>scheduled to be distributed in the West Bank in November. </p><p>Mellet noted that the ICRC\'s 15 trucks and international </p><p>drivers, currently used for transportation of relief supplies </p><p>between Jordan and the West Bank, also could be diverted to </p><p>respond to a crisis in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Although WFP has some excess wheat stocks, Kokash </p><p>told refcoord WFP lacks the stocks of cooking oil and </p><p>enriched biscuits necessary to respond immediately to a </p><p>crisis.  Kokash estimates that WFP would need 50 tons each of </p><p>cooking oil and enriched biscuits to respond to initial </p><p>refugee flows into Jordan, and has submitted these figures to </p><p>the UN-wide humanitarian action response plan.  Kokash warned </p><p>that without these stocks, the UN will be unable to meet </p><p>refugees\' food needs during the first two weeks of a crisis. </p><p> </p><p>IOM:  Preparing for 100,000 TCN\'s </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IOM Representative Georgette Hosche reports that </p><p>there are between 70,000 and 170,000 third-country nationals </p><p>(Egyptian, Sudanese and Palestinian) currently resident in </p><p>Iraq.  IOM contingency planning calls for the repatriation of </p><p>up to 100,000 TCN\'s (mainly Egyptians) through Jordan, but </p><p>notes that up to 250,000 guest workers throughout the Middle </p><p>East may seek IOM assistance in returning home in the event </p><p>of hostilities in Iraq.  IOM\'s contingency budget for </p><p>repatriations through Jordan calls for USD 1.9 million, a </p><p>figure that has not been included in the UN\'s humanitarian </p><p>action response plan.  Hosche told refcoord that IOM also is </p><p>prepared to assist UNHCR in registration of refugees, if </p><p>needed.  Hosche echoed UNHCR\'s concerns about the current </p><p>lack of coordination with the GOJ, noting that huge numbers </p><p>of TCN\'s could end up stuck in the desert without access to </p><p>food, shelter or water. </p><p> </p><p>ICRC & IFRC:  Worried about Stockpiles and Potential </p><p>Disruptions to OFF, Water System in Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In separate meetings with refcoord, Jordan-based ICRC </p><p>and IFRC officials expressed concern about their own lack of </p><p>stockpiles.  Although the ICRC has "huge" warehousing </p><p>capacities in Amman, its regional administrative efforts </p><p>currently are focused on supporting relief activities in the </p><p>West Bank and Gaza -- some of which could be diverted to Iraq </p><p>(see para 6).  However, ICRC Jordan Delegate Guy Mellet </p><p>reports that ICRC would have to airlift supplies from its </p><p>Kenya warehouses in order to meet non-food needs resulting </p><p>from hostilities in Iraq.  According to IFRC Regional </p><p>Delegate Christer Aqvist, the Federation currently only has </p><p>25 percent of the non-food supplies it estimates would be </p><p>necessary to provide support to an initial flow of 100,000 </p><p>displaced persons within Iraq.  Without a stockpile of these </p><p>supplies (tents, blankets, cooking kits, medical supplies, </p><p>etc.), Aqvist predicted that the first two weeks of a crisis </p><p>would be a "disaster."  Aqvist noted that the IFRC had </p><p>submitted a USD 1.5 million Iraq emergency preparedness </p><p>proposal to the American Red Cross, but that the proposal had </p><p>been rejected. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Both ICRC and IFRC expressed serious concern about </p><p>the Iraqi population\'s dependence on the Oil-for-Food program </p><p>and the serious implications of any disruption in the </p><p>program.  IFRC Iraq Delegate Sten Swedlund (in Jordan for </p><p>IFRC meetings) told refcoord "the entire population" of Iraq </p><p>is dependent on the OFF program for its food supply.  Any </p><p>disruption in OFF, Swedlund warned, could lead to serious </p><p>malnutrition problems.  IFRC public health specialist Greet </p><p>DeVries characterized the Iraqis as a population "on the </p><p>edge" both physically and psychologically.  As reported in </p><p>UNICEF\'s 2001 survey of children in Iraq, almost one-third of </p><p>children in the southern and central areas of Iraq suffer </p><p>from malnutrition and one in eight children in those areas </p><p>die before their fifth birthday.  DeVries warned that any </p><p>disruption in the OFF program could cause the figures to </p><p>worsen still further.  DeVries noted that no one she had met </p><p>during a recent month-long tour of Iraq had stockpiled food </p><p>or water supplies in their homes. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ICRC and IFRC also warned separately of the dangers </p><p>of disruptions to Iraq\'s water supplies.  According to ICRC </p><p>Delegate Guy Mellet Iraq\'s water supply system fell into a </p><p>serious state of disrepair when the guest workers who </p><p>previously had maintained the system fled Iraq in 1990-1991. </p><p>Since then, the ICRC has maintained the system and IFRC has </p><p>tried to work through the Iraq Red Crescent Society to </p><p>educate Iraqis on the proper way to treat unclean water, yet </p><p>rates of fatal diarrhea have continued to rise in Iraq.  In </p><p>order to manage the effects of any hostilities-inflicted </p><p>damage to the Iraq\'s water system, the IFRC believes an </p><p>immediate relief response would have to include jerry cans </p><p>with purification tablets.  IFRC Iraq Delegate Swedlund is </p><p>especially concerned about water and sanitation capabilities </p><p>in northern Iraq.  He said the infrastructure there, already </p><p>strained by population flows throughout the 1990s, cannot </p><p>handle new population flows without new resources. </p><p> </p><p>UNRWA:  Fears of a Two-Front Refugee Crisis </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Finally, UNRWA Jordan Field Director Bill Lee told </p><p>refcoord that relief agencies in Jordan are especially </p><p>concerned about the possibility of a two-front refugee </p><p>crisis, should Israeli policy or a new round of major </p><p>violence cause Palestinians to flee in significant numbers. </p><p>Lee reported that UNRWA, perpetually underfunded and </p><p>currently focused on emergency relief operations in the West </p><p>Bank and Gaza, does not have the capacity to respond to a new </p><p>Palestinian refugee flow into Jordan.  Lee also expressed </p><p>doubt that the GOJ would allow new Palestinians into Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) We are engaging with the GOJ to make sure they are </p><p>addressing the possibility of movement of TCN\'s through </p><p>and/or refugees into Jordan, and are coordinating in a </p><p>low-key fashion with the appropriate international assistance </p><p>organizations to assess potential needs and available </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
