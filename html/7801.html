(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Heralding a new phase of UAE Red Crescent </p><p>operations in Iraq, the UAE Air Force today </p><p>facilitated the first of four airlifts to Baghdad </p><p>International Airport on behalf of the Red Crescent </p><p>Authority (RCA).  RCA Secretary General San\'a Al-Kitbi </p><p>told Econoff 5/3 that the plane carried 15 tons of </p><p>medical equipment and medicines for seven different </p><p>hospitals in the Baghdad area.  The four airlifts </p><p>combined will deliver more than USD $300,000 in </p><p>medical supplies to Iraq.  Since November 2002, the </p><p>RCA has spent a total of USD $3,347,761 on its </p><p>humanitarian operations in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) According to Al-Kitbi, the medical airlifts </p><p>are only the first step in what is a plan to provide </p><p>seven hospitals located in different areas of Baghdad </p><p>with all the medical supplies and equipment they need </p><p>to offer both outpatient and long-term/surgical </p><p>services.  UAE medical experts are already in Baghdad </p><p>assisting with the complete renovation of the Olympic </p><p>Hospital near the Iraq Ministry of Health building and </p><p>have identified the seven hospitals to receive the RCA </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>In Other News... </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) According to press reports, the RCA delegation </p><p>that arrived to Umm Qasr 4/11 handed over six fully </p><p>equipped ambulances on 5/2 to the Iraqi Red Crescent </p><p>Society.  ICRC will assist the Iraqi Red Crescent in </p><p>the distribution of the ambulances to hospitals </p><p>located in remote areas of southern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Post also learned that RCA coordinated 5/1 a </p><p>convoy carrying 140 tons of food and medical aid to </p><p>Iraq from Jordan on behalf of Human Appeal </p><p>International -- the third largest NGO in the UAE. </p><p>UAE Ambassador to Jordan Rahma Al-Za\'abi dispatched </p><p>the convoy from Amman earlier this week.  Ten </p><p>representatives from the UAE branch of Human Appeal </p><p>International accompanied the supplies to Iraq, and </p><p>will distribute them to Al-Karekh Hospital and other </p><p>medical centers in central Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
