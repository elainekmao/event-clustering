<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001051 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: "JOY TV" SUSPENDS BBC NEWS BROADCASTS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSISIFED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) Joy Television, a nominally independent </p><p>   Zimbabwean television broadcaster, has suspended BBC </p><p>   News programming with immediate effect.  Since its </p><p>   launch in July 1997, the station has broadcast a BBC </p><p>   World TV news summary at 2000 each day.  Joy TV offered </p><p>   no explanation for dropping the BBC news. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) Joy TV operates on a frequency leased from the </p><p>   Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) and uses ZBC </p><p>   facilities for its few productions.  For the most part, </p><p>   Joy TV offers its viewers (limited to the Harare area) </p><p>   American sitcoms, action and talk shows.  As part of </p><p>   its licensing agreement with the Government of </p><p>   Zimbabwe, Joy TV does not produce its own news </p><p>   programming.  It has, on occasion, produced talk shows. </p><p>   Joy TV\'s most recent talk show series disappeared </p><p>   shortly after MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai appeared as </p><p>   the featured guest just before the presidential </p><p>   election. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) Comment:  Joy TV\'s license expires on May </p><p>   31, 2002.  The Government of Zimbabwe has indicated </p><p>   that it will not renew the license.  Joy TV management, </p><p>   however, maintains that it will find an accommodation </p><p>   with the government in order to stay on the air.  Given </p><p>   the Government of Zimbabwe\'s hatred of the BBC, we </p><p>   suspect that Joy TV\'s sudden cancellation of BBC news </p><p>   is part of that "accommodation." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
