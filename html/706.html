<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PHNOM PENH 000152 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, CB, FR, TH </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIEWS OF HOR NAMHONG, CAMBODIAN AMBASSADOR </p><p>          TO FRANCE </p><p> </p><p>1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FORMER SOC FOREIGN MINISTER AND PRESENT RCG </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO PARIS HOR NAMHONG EXCHANGED VIEWS WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR JANUARY 11 DURING A VISIT TO PHNOM PENH. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEORETICALLY NEUTRAL POLITICALLY, HOR NAMHONG </p><p>WITH HIS IMTIMATE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>FORMER REGIME HERE AND A WIDE RANGE OF CONTACTS HAS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE INFORMATION AT HAND OF INTEREST.  HE BEGAN </p><p>BY PRAISING THE EXCELLENT RELATIONS HE ENJOYS WITH </p><p>AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN IN PARIS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE KING.  DESPITE CPP FEARS THAT THE KING WOULD </p><p>SEEK TO GRAB POWER, HOR NAMHONG FOUND HIM DURING A </p><p>RECENT MEETING TO BE VERY RELAXED.  SIHANOUK PRAISED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY FOR ITS HANDLING OF THE KHMER </p><p>ROUGE, OBSERVING THAT THEY ARE EVERYWHERE ON THE RUN. </p><p>HE SAID THAT PEOPLE LIKE SON SANN, NHEK TIOULONG, AND </p><p>SAUMURA TIOULONG HAVE URGED HIM TO TAKE POWER, BUT HE </p><p>INSISTED THAT HE HAS SWORN LOYALTY TO THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>AND HAS NO INTENTION OF CHANGING THE SITUATION.  THE </p><p>KING SAID HE INTENDS TO BE A TRUE CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCH </p><p> </p><p>4.  EARLY ELECTIONS.  HOR NAMHONG SAID HE HAS BEEN </p><p>HEARING SOME PEOPLE SPEAK IN FAVOR OF EARLY ELECTIONS. </p><p>FOR SOME, IT WOULD BE A WAY TO OPEN THE DOOR TO NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION WITH THE KR, SOMETHING HE FINDS </p><p>PERSONALLY TO BE COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.  SOME WITHIN </p><p>FUNCINPEC BELIEVE AN EARLY ELECTION WOULD ENABLE THEIR </p><p>PARTY TO BE THE SOLE PARTY IN CHARGE, A FALSE VIEW WHEN </p><p>IT IS HARDLY CERTAIN THAT FUNCINPEC WOULD WIN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE SITUATION.  IN RESPONSE TO NAMHONG\'S QUESTION </p><p>ABOUT THE SITUATION, THE AMBASSADOR SAID IT SEEMS </p><p>BASICALLY ALL RIGHT.  BOTH STABILITY AND DEMOCRACY ARE </p><p>IMPORTANT, AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S SUCCESS AGAINST THE </p><p>DECLINING KR HAS BEEN IMPRESSIVE.  NAMHONG SAID HE IS </p><p>PLEASED WITH THAT THE TWO PRIME MINISTERS ARE WORKING </p><p>TOGETHER SO WELL.  AMBASSADOR TWINING POINTED OUT THAT, </p><p>WHILE WE SUPPORT THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT AND THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THE ELECTIONS, </p><p>STATEMENTS ALLUDING TO "ENEMIES" AMONG MP\'S AND OTHERS </p><p>WHO "OPPOSE" THE GOVERNMENT ARE DISTURBING.  A DEMOCRACY </p><p>ALLOWS FOR THE FREE EXPRESSION OF OPINION, INCLUDING IN </p><p>THE PRESS AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND NEGATIVE ALLUSIONS </p><p>TO THOSE WITH DIFFERING VIEWS IS NOT HELPFUL TO WHAT THE </p><p>NEW CAMBODIA STANDS FOR.  HOR NAMHONG SAID HE AGREED </p><p>FULLY.  THE PRESS NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIBLE, AND A PRESS </p><p>LAW PROVIDING FOR CIVIL PENALTIES SHOULD BE USEFUL IN </p><p>THIS REGARD.  AS FOR THE ASSEMBLY, DEPUTIES SHOULD BE </p><p>FREE TO SAY WHAT THEY WISH.  AMBASSADOR TWINING </p><p>EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THIS CAN BE EMPHASIZED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE JULY 2 COUP ATTEMPT.  HOR NAMHONG SAID THAT THE </p><p>DEGREE OF HIGHER CPP SUPPORT REMAINS UNCLEAR.  CHEA SIM </p><p>ASKED NAMHONG QUIETLY LATE LAST SUMMER TO REQUEST HUN </p><p>SEN NOT TO PURSUE PENALTIES FOR THE COUP PLOTTERS, A </p><p>MESSAGE HOR NAMHONG DID NOT DELIVER.  SIN SONG AND </p><p>PRINCE CHAKRAPONG PROBABLY MADE THEIR COUP ATTEMPT DUE </p><p>TO PIQUE THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN READMITTED TO THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, MORE THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON, A </p><p>RIDICULOUS REASON TO EJECT THE NEW GOVERNMENT ACHIEVED </p><p>AT GREAT COST TO THE WORLD COMMUNITY.  HUN SEN TOLD HIM </p><p>THAT THAI FOREIGN MINISTER THAKSIN REQUESTED A PRIVATE </p><p>MEETING DURING HIS DECEMBER 21 VISIT TO EXPRESS HIS </p><p>PERSONAL APPRECIATION FOR HUN SEN\'S STATEMENT </p><p>EXONERATING THAKSIN FROM INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP </p><p>ATTEMPT.  HUN SEN HAD BRIEFED SIHANOUK AT GREAT LENGTH </p><p>IN DETAIL LAST SEPTEMBER ABOUT THE COUP ATTEMPT, BUT THE </p><p>KING\'S DESIRE TO PARDON THOSE INVOLVED SEEMS TO INDICATE </p><p>THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE ALL THAT HUN SEN TOLD HIM.  HUN </p><p>SEN FEELS HE CAN BE HELPFUL IN SHORING UP SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>THAI BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOR INVESTMENT IN CAMBODIA </p><p>DURING HIS UPCOMING TRIP TO BANGKOK. </p><p> </p><p>7.  TAKING THE KR TO COURT.  HOR NAMHONG WAS PLEASED </p><p>THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN THE "GENOCIDE INVESTIGATION" </p><p>UNDERWAY.  OUR INFORMATION WILL BE HELPFUL WHEN A COURT </p><p>BEGINS TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE, SOMETHING IT IS </p><p>CAMBODIA\'S RESPONSIBILITY TO INSTIGATE.  IT IS INDEED </p><p>NECESSARY FOR TOP KR LEADERS TO BE PERSONALLY PUT ON THE </p><p>STAND.  FOR THAT, CAMBODIA WILL NEED TO ASK THAILAND FOR </p><p>HELP IN ASCERTAINING THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE KR LEADERS </p><p>SO THEY CAN BE TAKEN.  U.S. ASSISTANCE IN SUPPORTING THE </p><p>CAMBODIAN REQUEST WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  HE HAS </p><p>SUGGESTED TO RCAF CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF KE KIMYAN THAT </p><p>HE PREPARE THE GROUND FOR THIS WHEN HE NEXT MEETS WITH </p><p>THAI MILITARY LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  CAMBODIAN-FRENCH RELATIONS.  THE FRENCH FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER MADE A BIG MISTAKE IN CANCELLING HIS PROPOSED </p><p>VISIT TO CAMBODIA LAST MONTH.  "FRANCE CANNOT BASE ITS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP TOWARD CAMBODIA ON THE DEATH OF ONE </p><p>FRENCHMAN," I.E, IN LAST YEAR\'S HOSTAGE SITUATION.  HE </p><p>WAS ALSO WRONG WHEN HE STATED IN VIETNAM THAT THAT </p><p>COUNTRY IS THE FOCAL POINT FOR FRENCH POLICY TOWARD THE </p><p>THREE COUNTRIES OF THE SUB-REGION.  REGARDING MILITARY </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS, HOR NAMHONG SAID HE HAS URGED THE FRENCH </p><p>TO COORDINATE THEIR AID WITH THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA.  HE </p><p>IS ALSO PLEASED THAT THE FRENCH ARE FINALLY INVITING KE </p><p>KIMRAN TO MAKE AN OFFICIAL VISIT IN APRIL, FOLLOWING HIS </p><p>VISITS TO THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ICORC.  HOR NAMHONG\'S PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT, </p><p>FOLLOWING THE PARIS MEETING IN MARCH IN WHICH BOTH PRIME </p><p>MINISTERS WILL BE PARTICIPATING, THERE SHOULD BE ONLY </p><p>ONE MORE SUCH HIGH-LEVEL MEETING, HELD IN PHNOM PENH, </p><p>AFTER WHICH ICORC SHOULD BE CONVERTED INTO A </p><p>CONSULTATIVE GROUP.  HE INTENDS TO DISCUSS THIS WITH </p><p>PRINCE RANARIDDH DURING A JANUARY 12 MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE KR IN FRANCE.  THE KR, LED BY FORMER KR ENVOY </p><p>TO UNESCO OK SAKUN (A FRENCH CITIZEN), ARE ACTIVE IN </p><p>PROPAGANDIZING AMONG CAMBODIAN IN FRANCE.  WHILE THERE </p><p>ARE NOT MANY WHO ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE KR, A MUCH GREATER </p><p>NUMBER SYMPATHIZES WITH KR ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE </p><p>"ROTTEN" GOVERNMENT, ETC.  HOR NAMHONG DESCRIBED THIS AS </p><p>PART OF THE FRENCH AND FRENCH-CAMBODIAN WAY OF </p><p>INTELLECTUALIZING THINGS WITHOUT TAKING ACCOUNT OF </p><p>REALITY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT.  THE DISCUSSION WAS A USEFUL ONE.  HOR </p><p>NAMHONG WILL BE SEEING HUN SEN BEFORE HE LEAVES AND IS </p><p>LIKELY TO REPORT TO HIM ON OUR CONVERSATION, INCLUDING </p><p>OUR CONCERN REGARDING PEOPLE WHO TAKE A POSITION AT </p><p>VARIANCE WITH THE RCG VIEW AS BEING AGAINST THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THIS CAN BE HELPFUL. </p><p> </p><p>TWINING </p><p></p></div>
