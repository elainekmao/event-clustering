<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000610 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "A volley of propaganda" </p><p>Contributing foreign editor Eric Margolis wrote in the </p><p>conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (3/3): "...[W]hat I </p><p>dislike even more than Saddam\'s nasty regime are </p><p>government lies and propaganda. Since 9/11, Americans </p><p>have been subjected to the most intense propaganda </p><p>campaign from their government since World War I. Much </p><p>of the mainstream U.S. media have been intimidated </p><p>by the Bush administration into unquestioningly </p><p>amplifying its party line. Or, in the worst tradition </p><p>of yellow, jingoist journalism, they act as </p><p>cheerleaders for war.... The American public, often </p><p>wobbly about geography, history and international </p><p>affairs, has been alternatively terrified and enraged </p><p>by bare-faced lies that Iraq was about to attack </p><p>America with nuclear weapons or germs, and was a secret </p><p>ally of al-Qaida. A shocking two-thirds of Americans </p><p>mistakenly believe Iraq staged the 9/11 attacks.... </p><p>It\'s frightening to see Bush claim with a straight face </p><p>his war against Iraq will bring democracy and peace to </p><p>the Mideast, and save Iraqis from repression. Why </p><p>didn\'t he begin by saving Palestinians from the </p><p>repression by his alter-ego, Israeli Prime Minister </p><p>Ariel Sharon? If Bush really cared about Mideast </p><p>democracy, he\'s had two years to do something about </p><p>U.S.-sponsored dictatorships like Egypt and Pakistan, </p><p>or medieval autocracies such as Morocco, Jordan, Saudi </p><p>Arabia and America\'s Gulf protectorates. When Bush says </p><p>he will bring democracy to benighted Iraqis, what he </p><p>really means is U.S. rule. In Bush-speak, \'democracy\' </p><p>has been perverted to mean U.S. imperial hegemony.... </p><p>Many Americans simply don\'t understand their leadership </p><p>is about to plunge the nation into an open-ended, </p><p>dangerous colonial war. All the propaganda about </p><p>democracy, human rights and regional stability is the </p><p>same kind of double-talk used by the 19th century </p><p>British and French imperialists who claimed they were </p><p>grabbing Africa and Asia to bring the benefits of </p><p>Christian civilization to the heathens.... Misery loves </p><p>company. An American-occupied Iraq looks destined to </p><p>join the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza as another </p><p>human, political and moral disaster for all concerned." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Remaking the Arab world" </p><p>The conservative National Post editorialized (3/1): "In </p><p>a speech to the American Enterprise Institute on </p><p>Wednesday, U.S. President George W. Bush made the case </p><p>for war in terms that transcend weapons of mass </p><p>destruction and UN resolutions.... We hope the world </p><p>pays heed to Mr. Bush\'s message. While disarming Iraq, </p><p>ending the country\'s sponsorship of terrorism and </p><p>liberating Saddam Hussein\'s subjects are all war-worthy </p><p>goals, the greatest dividend to be hoped for in the </p><p>long run is the transformation of the Arab </p><p>Middle East.... In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Bush </p><p>declared that \'we will remain in Iraq as long as </p><p>necessary,\' and compared the coming reconstruction </p><p>project with the rebuilding of Japan and Germany six </p><p>decades ago.... The historical comparison is apt, and </p><p>we hope Mr. Bush follows through on these words. </p><p>Through its sustained presence in Iraq, the United </p><p>States will have a rare opportunity to transform the </p><p>Arab Middle East. It would be a tragedy if the </p><p>President turned his back on this crucial enterprise </p><p>once the immediate threat posed by Saddam is </p><p>extinguished." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "Peace can still prevail" </p><p>The liberal Toronto Star opined (3/3): "...American </p><p>pressure has stiffened the Security Council, which is </p><p>forcing Saddam - at last - to disarm. But Bush is now </p><p>perversely undermining the U.N. by making \'regime </p><p>change\' in Baghdad a requirement, in addition to </p><p>disarmament.... Democrats in Congress may be too timid </p><p>to challenge Bush. But polls suggest a fast-growing </p><p>public preference in America for working within the </p><p>U.N. to exhaust peaceful options. Enfeebled by years of </p><p>sanctions, Iraq presents no immediate threat. </p><p>The same can\'t be said of a Security Council at war </p><p>with itself. Making specific demands of Saddam, instead </p><p>of reiterating the Bush mantra that </p><p>\'Iraq must disarm,\' would silence those who contend </p><p>that Bush can never be satisfied. Saddam\'s obduracy is </p><p>infuriating. And he is dangerous.... Still, Saddam has </p><p>blinked. That suggests there\'s a chance he can be </p><p>disarmed peacefully. That would vindicate Bush. </p><p>Reaffirm American leadership. Enhance U.S. prestige. </p><p>And strengthen the United Nations. All without firing a </p><p>shot. It\'s worth a try." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
