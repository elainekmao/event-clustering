(U) As instructed ref A, post provides input for the </p><p>2003 Anti-trafficking in Persons report.  The point of </p><p>contact in Vietnam is Tim Swanson, tel. 84-4-772-1500 and </p><p>fax 84-4-772-2614.  Post estimates that collecting </p><p>information for and drafting the report required 48 hours, </p><p>including 8 hours by an FSN.  Post would appreciate having </p><p>the opportunity to comment on the placement and the report </p><p>language for Vietnam based on the following information. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Below are answers to the questions posed in </p><p>paragraphs 16, 17, 18, and 19 of ref A. </p><p> </p><p>Begin response to questions. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Overview: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Vietnam is both a country of origin and transit for </p><p>trafficked persons.  In addition, women and children are </p><p>also trafficked within Vietnam, usually from rural to urban </p><p>areas.  Poor women and teenage girls, especially those from </p><p>rural areas, are most at risk for being trafficked.  Men </p><p>from similar situations are more likely to seek low paid, </p><p>unskilled, manual labor either in Vietnam\'s cities or </p><p>abroad. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnam has neither comprehensive nor reliable statistics on </p><p>the numbers of persons trafficked from and through Vietnam. </p><p>However, local and foreign experts agree the numbers are </p><p>proportionally lower than those of most other countries in </p><p>the region. </p><p> </p><p>Available statistics are primarily based on cases brought to </p><p>court through 2001.  Because this data only counts cases </p><p>that are discovered and prosecuted, they underestimate the </p><p>true extent of trafficking in persons in Vietnam.  Only </p><p>partial statistics are available for 2002, although the </p><p>officials of the Supreme People\'s Procuracy have stated that </p><p>"hundreds" of traffickers are prosecuted annually.  An </p><p>article published in 2002 in newspapers of the Border Guards </p><p>Command and the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) reported </p><p>256 trafficking cases with 438 defendants in 2001 and 213 </p><p>cases with 351 defendants in 2000.  Between the beginning of </p><p>2001 and early 2003, MPS recorded 270 court cases involving </p><p>trafficking to China with 428 defendants, of whom 200 were </p><p>men.  During the same time period, MPS noted 1080 victims of </p><p>trafficking to China, including 1058 women and girls as well </p><p>as 22 boys.  One MPS estimate is that the actual volume of </p><p>trafficking is six to ten times higher, but Post is unaware </p><p>of the basis for this guess.  On average in the 1990\'s, </p><p>Vietnamese courts heard 300-400 cases per year, involving </p><p>500-700 trafficking victims.  According to a 2001 Vietnamese </p><p>press report, between 1996 and 2000, police "cracked down on </p><p>61 women trafficking rings involving 598 individuals."  The </p><p>statistics available do not include information on </p><p>conviction rates for trafficking and related charges, but </p><p>the overall conviction rate in Vietnamese courts is about </p><p>95%.  Therefore, post believes that nearly as many </p><p>traffickers were convicted as prosecuted. </p><p> </p><p>Data available from border guards concerning women and </p><p>children being trafficked abroad are spotty.  According to </p><p>one report, between 1990-2000, approximately 20,000 young </p><p>women and girls went to China to become brides, domestic </p><p>workers, or sex workers; however, it is not clear how many </p><p>were victims of trafficking.  (Note: Observers believe many, </p><p>if not most, of these young women were voluntary migrants </p><p>and, at least initially, not victims of trafficking.)  Also </p><p>according to border statistics, from 1995-2000, 5000 women </p><p>and children were trafficked to, and subsequently escaped </p><p>from, Cambodia.  As with other statistics available on </p><p>trafficking, these data likely underestimate the magnitude </p><p>of the problem.  According to a Vietnamese press report </p><p>dated 11/28/01, "Seventy percent, or 31,500, of a total of </p><p>45,000 prostitutes working in Cambodia is Vietnamese, of </p><p>whom 30% are under 17."  Although some of these sex workers </p><p>were from Cambodia\'s ethnic Vietnamese minority, some were </p><p>trafficked from Vietnam.  (Note:  Post was not able to </p><p>obtain updated statistics on cross border movements.  End </p><p>note.)  According to International Organization for </p><p>Migration (IOM) sources, "several dozen" Vietnamese </p><p>trafficking victims, many of them teenagers, were </p><p>repatriated from Cambodia in 2001 and 2002. </p><p> </p><p>B.   Vietnamese trafficking victims originate primarily from </p><p>poor rural provinces bordering Cambodia and China.  Some </p><p>also come from other nearby highland provinces.  There is </p><p>also evidence that a smaller number of victims are from </p><p>poor, urban areas. </p><p> </p><p>Women and girls trafficked abroad go primarily to Cambodia </p><p>and China.  Some women from Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong </p><p>Delta who married men from Taiwan were forced into </p><p>prostitution or domestic servitude after their arrival in </p><p>Taiwan.  Since 1995, about 60,000 Vietnamese women have gone </p><p>to Taiwan as brides.  Vietnamese and Taiwan estimates of the </p><p>number who have encountered difficulties, including but not </p><p>limited to trafficking, vary from less than one percent up </p><p>to 14 or 15 percent, but most fall around five percent. </p><p>There have also been reports that Vietnamese women have been </p><p>trafficked to Singapore, Macao, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and </p><p>Thailand.  During 2002, there were at least two local press </p><p>reports about Vietnamese women trafficked for prostitution </p><p>from Ho Chi Minh City to Malaysia via Bangkok.  MPS </p><p>confirmed that trafficking of women to Malaysia is a growing </p><p>problem, with criminal organizations taking advantage of </p><p>labor export programs.  Some of this trafficking occurs </p><p>directly from Vietnam.  There are also reports that </p><p>Vietnamese residing elsewhere in the region have been </p><p>trafficked to third countries.  For example, the Vietnamese </p><p>press reported arrests of traffickers accused of moving </p><p>Vietnamese (and others) from Cambodia to Thailand and </p><p>Malaysia.  MPS noted that is has "good information" that </p><p>some Vietnamese women trafficked to China are subsequently </p><p>trafficked to third countries, especially Japan and the </p><p>United States. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnamese authorities, in cooperation with the INS and </p><p>other third country law enforcement officials, have </p><p>documented cases of trafficking in Vietnamese babies for </p><p>international adoption, especially in the area of directed </p><p>adoption, involving payments to parents in exchange for </p><p>releasing their babies for adoption. </p><p> </p><p>Trafficking also occurs within Vietnam, primarily from poor </p><p>rural areas to the relatively wealthier urban areas of Ho </p><p>Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Haiphong, and Danang.  In the past, </p><p>Vietnamese officials have been relatively reluctant to </p><p>acknowledge internal trafficking.  More recently, officials </p><p>have discussed internal trafficking alongside international </p><p>trafficking and have noted that the definition of </p><p>trafficking in Vietnamese law does not require crossing a </p><p>border.   There are no official data on the extent of </p><p>internal trafficking.  According to one MPS estimate, </p><p>domestic trafficking accounted for approximately 44.5% of </p><p>all Vietnamese women trafficked, although experts in </p><p>trafficking issues question the origin and reliability of </p><p>this statistic, suspecting it may be too high.  Experts </p><p>agreed the GVN has begun to give greater attention to the </p><p>issue of internal trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnam is also a known transit point for trafficking. </p><p>While Vietnamese authorities focus on protecting and </p><p>providing services to Vietnamese citizens, U.S. and third </p><p>country law enforcement officials note that third country </p><p>organized criminal gangs use Vietnam as a transit point from </p><p>China and a number of Middle Eastern countries to Australia, </p><p>Europe, and Canada.  Vietnamese police cooperate with third </p><p>country law enforcement personnel on such cases.  According </p><p>to an INS official in Vietnam this cooperation has </p><p>progressed to the point that not only are Vietnamese </p><p>officials reacting to tips and queries but are also asking </p><p>INS and the Australian Federal Police for advice and </p><p>collaboration on suspected cases.  Such cases prompted </p><p>Australia and Vietnam to sign an agreement stating their </p><p>mutual commitment to combating trafficking in women and </p><p>children.  Vietnam has clearly and repeatedly indicated its </p><p>willingness to conclude other such agreements, including </p><p>with the United States. </p><p> </p><p>C.  Reliable statistical information on trafficking in </p><p>persons remains scarce and incomplete.  UNICEF and MPS </p><p>reported that 2002 survey of ten northern provinces showed </p><p>that a growing proportion of victims were coming from </p><p>provinces far from the China border.  UNICEF also noted that </p><p>some recently repatriated victims from China were actually </p><p>from southern Vietnam and had been trafficked to China </p><p>through Cambodia.  Preliminary findings of a </p><p>UNDP/International Labor Organization (ILO) study conducted </p><p>in conjunction with a project to combat trafficking in the </p><p>Mekong sub-region discovered that many women originally </p><p>reportedly trafficked to China from one province in the </p><p>1990\'s had not actually been trafficked.  GVN officials have </p><p>been quoted in the press as admitting that trafficking was a </p><p>growing problem.  All sources Post interviewed for this </p><p>report claimed, however, that it was impossible to tell </p><p>whether the problem was growing; while there is some feeling </p><p>that it may be leveling off, no officials claimed that it </p><p>was declining.  It is not clear if the overall problem is </p><p>indeed growing, or if it is merely the officials\' awareness </p><p>of trafficking (and its patterns and causes) that is </p><p>growing. </p><p> </p><p>D.  UNODCP plans to undertake a thorough survey of </p><p>trafficking in Vietnam in cooperation with the MPS, the </p><p>Supreme People\'s Procuracy, and the Women\'s Union.  The </p><p>project would also set up a sustainable data collection </p><p>system to be housed within a new office of crime statistics </p><p>within the Procuracy.  Post has submitted a funding request </p><p>to INL to carry out this project (Ref B).  The Vietnam </p><p>portion of a UNDP/ILO regional project combating trafficking </p><p>in women and children in the Mekong sub-region is updating </p><p>and reviewing existing studies to gain a more comprehensive </p><p>understanding of trafficking.  This project is also </p><p>developing a case management database that may be used in </p><p>the future to add to what we know about trafficking in </p><p>persons in Vietnam.  Preliminary findings (see 16. C.) </p><p>indicate that many earlier reported cases do not meet the </p><p>definition of trafficking.  The supposed victims reported </p><p>that they had been free to return at any time.  Many </p><p>Vietnamese and international trafficking experts have </p><p>expressed concern about the lack of data, which makes design </p><p>of appropriate prevention and protection measures difficult, </p><p>and are seeking funding from the U.S. and other donors to </p><p>carry out this much needed survey work.   The Asia </p><p>Foundation has received funding from G/TIP for an anti- </p><p>trafficking project, one component of which is research into </p><p>the root causes of trafficking and gaps in available </p><p>coverage.  The project is just getting underway.  UNICEF and </p><p>MPS plan to replicate in ten southern provinces a survey </p><p>they conducted in ten northern provinces in 2002 (see 16. </p><p>C.). </p><p> </p><p>E.  Post has no information that Vietnam is a destination </p><p>point for trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p>F.  Poor women and teenage girls, especially those from </p><p>rural areas, are most at risk for being trafficked.  UNICEF </p><p>research showed that victims tend to be from moderately poor </p><p>rural areas and have from six to nine years of education. </p><p>Few come from the most remote and poorest areas, although </p><p>recently there appears to be demand in China for Vietnamese </p><p>ethnic minorities because they are "more docile" than the </p><p>ethnic majority Kinh.  Some are sold or indentured by their </p><p>families as domestic workers or sex workers.  Some want to </p><p>be brides of foreign husbands.  Tales of lucrative </p><p>employment lures others.  They then find themselves forced </p><p>into brothels, abusive marriages, or involuntary servitude, </p><p>especially as domestics.  IOM reports that young girls and </p><p>women who are trafficked often are tricked by enticing </p><p>offers brokered by acquaintances.  In addition, the family </p><p>members of teenage girls in poor rural areas often turn a </p><p>blind eye to the details of perceived lucrative offers for </p><p>their daughters\' employment abroad.  Poor families in the </p><p>Mekong Delta region sometimes take a payment of several </p><p>hundred dollars - a large sum for many families (per capita </p><p>income is $400 countrywide and in rural areas is </p><p>considerably lower) - in exchange for allowing their </p><p>daughters to go to Cambodia for an "employment offer."  IOM </p><p>reports that, while there was no indication that the number </p><p>of such victims changed substantially in 2001-2002, the age </p><p>of some girls trafficked to Cambodia has fallen to 13-15, </p><p>something not seen before.  UNICEF also reported that, for </p><p>the first time, in 2002 some girls trafficked to China were </p><p>also as young as 13-15. </p><p> </p><p>Post believes that the Vietnamese traffickers have been </p><p>primarily individual opportunists or small groups.  MPS has </p><p>become concerned with what it describes as progressively </p><p>more sophisticated criminal groups that are using legal </p><p>fronts such as labor export companies and tourism agencies </p><p>to conduct trafficking in persons.  While these groups </p><p>appear to be entirely Vietnamese, some include Vietnamese </p><p>residing abroad.  Anecdotal evidence from organizations such </p><p>as IOM, ILO, and MPS, as well as foreign consular </p><p>authorities in Vietnam, suggest that informal networks </p><p>operate, with "brokers" introducing women and girls to those </p><p>who offer employment abroad, often disguising the real </p><p>nature of the (sex) work.  Frequently, these "brokers" are </p><p>family members or from the same community as the victim.  At </p><p>times, they, too, have been victims of trafficking and </p><p>return to "recruit" others.  Some experts have expressed </p><p>concern that traffickers are becoming more organized and </p><p>developing direct affiliations to others involved in </p><p>smuggling of goods, and perhaps, drug trafficking.  Ministry </p><p>of Justice (MOJ) officials contacted for this report </p><p>indicated that there did not seem to be any significant </p><p>overlap between drug traffickers and human traffickers.  MPS </p><p>has described loosely linked cells, each specializing in </p><p>particular tasks such as recruiting or cross-border </p><p>smuggling, which form chains to carry out human trafficking. </p><p>Reliable observers have noted that individual members of </p><p>Taiwanese organized crime groups are among those bringing </p><p>Vietnamese women to Taiwan through marriage.  However, other </p><p>than use of Vietnam as a transit point for trafficked </p><p>persons, there is little other hard evidence of involvement </p><p>by international organized crime at present. </p><p> </p><p>MPS is paying increasing attention to the involvement of GVN </p><p>officials in trafficking in persons.  Such involvement </p><p>appears primarily to be through providing false documents as </p><p>well as authentic, but fraudulently obtained, passports. </p><p>Greater MPS scrutiny parallels a longer-standing effort to </p><p>crack down on mid- and low-level officials providing false </p><p>documents in support of fraudulent international adoptions. </p><p> </p><p>G.  There is a commitment at the highest levels of the GVN </p><p>to combating trafficking in persons.  In 1997, the Prime </p><p>Minister issued a decree instructing GVN ministries to </p><p>combat trafficking in women and children and assigning </p><p>responsibilities in this effort.  Since that time, official </p><p>GVN entities have made a good faith effort to address </p><p>trafficking.  As an initial step, the GVN amended the </p><p>existing criminal code to increase the penalties for </p><p>trafficking in women and children, which is specifically </p><p>prohibited by law.  The GVN developed and has begun </p><p>implementing a five-year Plan of Action Against Prostitution </p><p>2001-2005, which addresses combating trafficking in women </p><p>and children both abroad and internally.  The Ministry of </p><p>Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) continues to </p><p>work on a dedicated action plan against trafficking in women </p><p>and children.  Conceptually, this would task an </p><p>interministerial working group led by a Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister with coordinating anti-trafficking activities. </p><p>Numerous anti-trafficking initiatives have been and are </p><p>being conducted by a variety of government agencies and </p><p>Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV)-affiliated mass </p><p>organizations.  The GVN has devoted scarce domestic </p><p>resources -- financial, human, and physical -- and drawn on </p><p>international assistance to conduct trafficking initiatives. </p><p>The MOJ, in cooperation with UNICEF, organized a national </p><p>workshop in 2002 to begin efforts to revise laws and </p><p>implement the necessary systemic changes for Vietnam to </p><p>ratify and implement the Optional Protocol Against the Worst </p><p>Forms of Trafficking in Women and Children of the Covenant </p><p>Against Transnational Organized Crime.  In 2002, various GVN </p><p>entities agreed to participate in anti-trafficking projects </p><p>undertaken by the UNODCP, UNICEF, IOM, and the Asia </p><p>Foundation.  In 2002, the GVN actively participated in </p><p>implementing two anti-trafficking projects conducted by the </p><p>UNDP and the ILO as part of their larger Mekong regional </p><p>anti-trafficking programs. </p><p> </p><p>H.  The GVN officially condemns trafficking in persons and </p><p>there is no evidence that any GVN agencies have engaged in </p><p>or tolerated trafficking.  However, experts in this field </p><p>report that individual GVN officials, most frequently border </p><p>guards and other low- to mid-level functionaries, have taken </p><p>bribes in return for facilitating trafficking.  Corruption </p><p>by GVN officials is recognized as a serious problem at all </p><p>levels in Vietnam.  According to GVN sources, the GVN has </p><p>prosecuted and convicted a number of officials involved in </p><p>baby selling and other forms of trafficking, but they were </p><p>unable to provide specifics.  Official media reports have </p><p>also mentioned several prosecutions against local officials </p><p>involved in illegal adoption schemes.  In the case of the </p><p>sale of children for fraudulent international adoptions, </p><p>Post has hard evidence of the involvement of some mid-level </p><p>GVN ministry and provincial officials.  MOJ officials noted </p><p>at least four trafficking cases prosecuted against local GVN </p><p>officials in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>State-owned labor supply companies reportedly supplied </p><p>workers to a Korean-owned garment manufacturer, Daewoosa, in </p><p>American Samoa.  These workers were subjected to debt </p><p>bondage, mistreatment, threats, and abuse.  The Korean owner </p><p>has been convicted of involuntary servitude, money </p><p>laundering, conspiracy, and extortion in this case, but was </p><p>not tried on trafficking charges.  There has not been a </p><p>legal determination that these workers were trafficked or </p><p>that the Vietnamese manpower supply companies were involved </p><p>in trafficking.  Partly as a result of this case, the GVN </p><p>initiated a widely publicized review of the operations and </p><p>finances of licensed labor supply companies, which resulted </p><p>in the temporary or permanent suspension of the operating </p><p>licenses of several companies, including one that supplied </p><p>workers to Daewoosa.  In addition, the director of the </p><p>second labor supply company involved with Daewoosa was </p><p>convicted on corruption charges.  While Post is not aware of </p><p>a direct connection between the director\'s conviction and </p><p>the Daewoosa case, some of our contacts have speculated that </p><p>the investigation that led to his conviction resulted in </p><p>part from the scrutiny brought to bear on the company by the </p><p>American Samoa case. </p><p> </p><p>I.  The GVN faces very real financial and manpower </p><p>constraints that limit its anti-trafficking efforts. </p><p>Resource constraints are a major obstacle to progress in the </p><p>fight against trafficking in persons, including prevention, </p><p>investigation and prosecution, and assistance to victims. </p><p>Vietnam is one of the world\'s poorest countries, with an </p><p>annual per capita income of approximately $400.  Anti- </p><p>trafficking programs compete with other important but under- </p><p>funded public programs including health, poverty </p><p>alleviation, basic sanitation, education, and other public </p><p>services.  Social programs are not the only ones that go </p><p>begging in the budget process.  Infrastructure development, </p><p>law enforcement, and even national defense struggle with </p><p>severe financial constraints.  The country\'s poverty is the </p><p>major "push" for the poor who are at greatest risk of </p><p>falling victim to trafficking schemes.  The shortage of </p><p>financial resources also keeps GVN salaries very low, widely </p><p>perceived as a major factor contributing to corruption, </p><p>which in turn can facilitate trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Prevention: </p><p> </p><p>A.  The GVN has officially acknowledged that trafficking in </p><p>persons is a problem.  NGOs generally give the GVN high </p><p>marks for its forthright efforts to try to prevent </p><p>trafficking; GVN agencies are actively searching for </p><p>additional foreign assistance to address the problem.  GVN </p><p>officials working in the area recognize that trafficking </p><p>could further expand if serious efforts are not made to </p><p>combat it.  National Assembly members have described </p><p>trafficking as a "burning issue." </p><p> </p><p>B.  Several GVN agencies and organizations are engaged in </p><p>anti-trafficking work.  MOLISA is responsible for prevention </p><p>and rehabilitation.  Other concerned ministries include the </p><p>MPS, the MOJ, and the Border Guards Command of the Ministry </p><p>of Defense.  Also involved are the GVN Committee for </p><p>Population, Family, and Children (CPFC) (note:  A 2002 </p><p>government reorganization merged the Committee for </p><p>Protection and Care of Children (CPCC) with the Committee </p><p>for Population and Family Planning. end note), the Supreme </p><p>People\'s Procuracy, and several CPV-affiliated mass </p><p>organizations, including the Women\'s Union, the Youth Union, </p><p>and, to a lesser extent, the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce </p><p>and Industry and the Vietnamese General Confederation of </p><p>Labor. </p><p> </p><p>C.  Yes.  MOLISA, the Women\'s Union, and the CPFC all have </p><p>active information campaigns using a variety of formats, </p><p>including distribution of leaflets and training of community </p><p>trainers aimed at populations deemed to be at risk, as well </p><p>as general information campaigns via the state-owned media. </p><p>These campaigns have been useful, but experts have stated </p><p>that both the messages and the methods are staid and could </p><p>be improved to increase campaigns\' effectiveness, especially </p><p>in the south.  The Asia Foundation is beginning a USG-funded </p><p>project in cooperation with the Women\'s Union that will test </p><p>and evaluate the suitability of several international best </p><p>practices in information campaigns. </p><p> </p><p>D.  GVN and CPV-affiliated organizations also conduct </p><p>programs to prevent trafficking, such as vocational </p><p>training, enterprise development, and micro-credit.  There </p><p>is general agreement that one of the major underlying </p><p>factors leading to trafficking in Vietnam is poverty and </p><p>uneven distribution of the benefits of the economic reforms </p><p>and integration underway since the late 1980\'s.  Therefore, </p><p>these organizations support programs designed to create jobs </p><p>and alleviate poverty.  Such projects have long been </p><p>conducted under large poverty alleviation programs.  More </p><p>recently, the GVN and international donors have begun </p><p>incorporating them as specific strategies in anti- </p><p>trafficking programs.  The GVN raised the level of universal </p><p>education from six years to nine years in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>E.  The GVN supports prevention programs. Prevention efforts </p><p>are focused on education of at-risk populations, vocational </p><p>training, micro-credit programs, and other poverty </p><p>alleviation programs.  More resources would be readily </p><p>welcomed by those agencies involved in prevention.  GVN </p><p>agencies have actively sought assistance from the USG and </p><p>other governments to confront the problem. </p><p> </p><p>F.  The UN agencies in Hanoi, led by UNICEF, UNDP, and </p><p>UNODCP, have undertaken efforts to establish a strategic </p><p>working group to pull together GVN, NGO, IO, and individual </p><p>donor governments to coordinate efforts on trafficking in </p><p>persons in Vietnam.  UNICEF has also worked to facilitate </p><p>cooperation between Vietnamese and Chinese authorities to </p><p>combat trafficking.  UNICEF has also worked extensively with </p><p>MOLISA, MPS, the Border Guards Command, and the MOJ on </p><p>various anti-trafficking projects.  Individual NGOs and </p><p>international organizations cooperate on specific projects </p><p>around the country.  For example, IOM conducted a nation- </p><p>wide education campaign in concert with GVN agencies and </p><p>international actors such as UNICEF.  IOM is currently </p><p>partnered with the Women\'s Union and the CPFC in a number of </p><p>provinces to provide rehabilitation assistance for </p><p>returnees.  MOLISA has partnered with UNDP and ILO on two </p><p>large regional anti-trafficking projects.  Small, domestic </p><p>NGO-like organizations exist, and a few have anti- </p><p>trafficking activities.  However, no legal framework exists </p><p>yet permitting the formal establishment of domestic NGO\'s. </p><p>Therefore, these groups work primarily with international </p><p>entities and are not able to cooperate or interact </p><p>effectively with official GVN agencies. </p><p> </p><p>G.  It is difficult for the GVN adequately to monitor its </p><p>borders.  Vietnam has a long and generally sparsely </p><p>populated land borders with China, Laos, and Cambodia, </p><p>making it easy for traffickers to evade border detection. </p><p>Resources, rugged terrain, and a long-standing border </p><p>dispute with Cambodia also limit the GVN\'s border monitoring </p><p>efforts.  Land border posts lack computer equipment and </p><p>often do not have telephones or radios. </p><p> </p><p>H.  The Prime Minister issued a directive in 1997 </p><p>instructing specific ministries (listed in B above) to </p><p>combat trafficking of women and children overseas and </p><p>assigning them specific responsibilities.  While this </p><p>arrangement has produced results (see 23. G), observers </p><p>inside and outside the GVN note there is room for further </p><p>improvement.  The directive designated MOLISA as the focal </p><p>point; for a time it appeared that this gave MOLISA policy </p><p>leadership, but in practice, this did not happen.  MOLISA </p><p>was generally unresponsive to efforts to broaden the focus </p><p>beyond trafficking in women and children for the purpose of </p><p>sexual exploitation.  Rather than fostering comprehensive, </p><p>coordinated interagency work, MOLISA appeared to favor an </p><p>approach that ensured that all agencies worked only in their </p><p>special areas of competency.  In particular, MOLISA was said </p><p>to resist working with the MOJ, which was charged by the </p><p>Prime Minister with drafting laws and regulations on </p><p>trafficking.  MOJ and other GVN entities have exhibited a </p><p>broader approach to trafficking; MOLISA has now also begun </p><p>to show interest in a more flexible and coordinated </p><p>approach.  MOJ, with support from the National Assembly, has </p><p>begun studying possible legislation and policy changes on </p><p>trafficking in persons.  The MPS has actively enforced </p><p>existing laws on trafficking in women and children.  The </p><p>Border Guards exercised responsibility for receiving and </p><p>repatriating returning victims.  Other GVN entities have </p><p>worked with MOLISA on prevention and rehabilitation.  (Note: </p><p>This problem of inter-ministerial cooperation is not limited </p><p>or unique to trafficking issues. End note) </p><p> </p><p>The GVN is conducting a five-year evaluation report of the </p><p>Prime Minister\'s 1997 decree on combating trafficking in </p><p>women and children.  MPS sources stated that one of the </p><p>recommendations of the evaluation will be more clearly to </p><p>assign a GVN entity to be in charge of overall efforts to </p><p>combat trafficking.  Other sources said that this </p><p>organization could be a Deputy Prime Minister-led </p><p>interministerial steering committee.  Another possibility </p><p>would be to add responsibility for trafficking to an </p><p>existing interministerial steering committee responsible for </p><p>prostitution, illegal drugs, and HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>The GVN and the CPV have concentrated considerable attention </p><p>on the problem of corruption.  While the GVN does not have a </p><p>specific anti-corruption task force, such a body does exist </p><p>within the CPV.  The largest corruption-related trial in SRV </p><p>history, centered on an organized crime gang in Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City, began on February 25, 2003.  In all, 155 persons were </p><p>indicted, including two Central Committee members (one a </p><p>Deputy Minister of Public Security and another the head of </p><p>Voice of Vietnam Radio), as well as the second-ranking </p><p>prosecutor in Vietnam and over a dozen lower ranking law </p><p>enforcement officials.  Charges include murder, bribery, </p><p>gambling, drug trafficking, alien smuggling, and extortion. </p><p>Even before the trial began, the CPV and GVN stripped the </p><p>two Central Committee members from their party and </p><p>governmental posts. </p><p> </p><p>The GVN agreed to accept Swedish ODA for an anti-corruption </p><p>project in September 2002, the first time the GVN has </p><p>allowed foreigners directly to address the subject. </p><p> </p><p>Post\'s contacts almost uniformly indicate that corruption </p><p>facilitates trafficking, but reject the notion that </p><p>corruption drives trafficking or that trafficking is </p><p>actually encouraged by GVN officials. </p><p> </p><p>I.  The GVN has been an active participant in multinational </p><p>and international conferences on trafficking and related </p><p>issues where trafficking is discussed.  In 2001, the GVN </p><p>sent a delegation to the Second World Congress against the </p><p>Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in Yokohama.  In </p><p>February 2002, Vietnam was represented at the Vice Foreign </p><p>Minister level at the regional conference on People </p><p>Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons in Bali, Indonesia. </p><p>The UNDP and ILO regional anti-trafficking projects both </p><p>contain components intended to improve regional cooperation </p><p>on this issue, and the GVN officials working in this area </p><p>support these efforts.  GVN officials working on trafficking </p><p>visited China in 2001 and visited Cambodia in March 2002 to </p><p>share information and improve cooperative efforts to </p><p>prevent, monitor, and control trafficking.  GVN officials </p><p>participated in UNICEF-sponsored meetings with their Chinese </p><p>counterparts in March and November 2002 to increase cross- </p><p>border law enforcement cooperation on trafficking in </p><p>persons.  Law enforcement officials on the border meet </p><p>regularly with their Chinese counterparts to exchange </p><p>information and coordinate activities. </p><p> </p><p>J.  As noted in 16. G, the GVN has developed a five-year </p><p>plan of action for 2001-2005 against prostitution that </p><p>addresses some trafficking-related problems.  A one-year </p><p>progress report will be available soon.  MOLISA is also </p><p>discussing a more specific plan of action against </p><p>trafficking.  This plan could dovetail with creation of new </p><p>working group on trafficking in persons.  (See 17. H.) </p><p>However, MOLISA has not yet consulted several other </p><p>ministries, including the MOJ, and will need them to weigh </p><p>in.  Nonetheless, some observers predict that the plan could </p><p>be completed by the end of 2003. </p><p> </p><p>K.  MOLISA is responsible for prevention and rehabilitation </p><p>policies, MPS and the Supreme People\'s Procuracy for law </p><p>enforcement and prosecution, and MOJ for legislation. </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense also </p><p>have roles, as do some smaller government entities. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Article 119 of the Criminal Code prohibits and </p><p>prescribes punishment for trafficking in women; Article 120 </p><p>prohibits and prescribes punishment for trafficking in </p><p>children.  There is no law that specifically prohibits </p><p>trafficking in men; however, Chapter VI, Article 24, </p><p>Paragraph 1 of Decree No. 152/1999/ND-CP could be used to </p><p>discipline traffickers who recruit or send men abroad to </p><p>work for "illegitimate profits" or illegal purposes.  In </p><p>severe cases, this decree contemplates criminal punishment </p><p>but does not set out a specific sentence for such a crime. </p><p>Save the Children recently published a comparative study on </p><p>the legal provisions of Mekong sub-region countries on </p><p>trafficking in women and children, and noted that, according </p><p>to Vietnamese law, "offenders" must have "traded" victims. </p><p>It also reported that Vietnam\'s law does not "deem that the </p><p>offense of human trafficking can be committed even with the </p><p>victim\'s consent," as do the laws of Cambodia and Thailand. </p><p>Therefore, Vietnamese anti-trafficking laws may not include </p><p>cases where the victim went willingly, but, for instance, </p><p>later was unable to leave, or was placed in debt bondage. </p><p>In practice, GVN authorities nonetheless seem to treat at </p><p>least some such cases as trafficking anyway.  For instance, </p><p>MPS is investigating persons who allegedly tricked women </p><p>into going to Malaysia in 2002 under the aegis of labor </p><p>export, only to find themselves forced into prostitution. </p><p> </p><p>The GVN revised its Marriage and Family law in 2002 to curb </p><p>abuse of marriage, recognition of parents and children, or </p><p>adoption for the purpose of selling, buying or exploitation </p><p>of for labor, sexual or other commercial purposes (Ref C). </p><p>While much of the new law aimed at tightening up </p><p>international adoption procedures, it adds another measure </p><p>to prosecute some human traffickers and prohibits private </p><p>marriage brokerage services that have been used as a </p><p>mechanism for trafficking to Taiwan and elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p>The GVN also tightened up regulations on labor exports (Ref </p><p>D), another mechanism that has been exploited for </p><p>trafficking.  Companies are now required to have 7 billion </p><p>VN dong (about US$455,000) in registered capital, have at </p><p>least seven managers with tertiary education and foreign </p><p>language abilities, have their own training facilities and </p><p>connections to an independent training facility, and provide </p><p>workers training, according to explicit GVN requirements. </p><p>The GVN is reviewing contracts between workers and labor </p><p>export companies and has reduced fees that companies can </p><p>charge to workers.  It has also mandated training for </p><p>company managers and representatives in relevant host </p><p>country and Vietnamese laws.  The GVN is continuing to </p><p>review its labor export programs to tighten them up further. </p><p> </p><p>The GVN is also studying the legal changes required to </p><p>ratify and implement the Optional Protocol Against </p><p>Trafficking in Women and Children of the TNOC. </p><p> </p><p>B.  The penalties for trafficking in women are 2-7 years in </p><p>prison, with heavier sentences of 5-20 years for more </p><p>serious crimes involving organized criminal activity </p><p>(literally, "in an organized manner"), trafficking abroad, </p><p>trafficking more than one person, or a repeat offence.  The </p><p>penalties for trafficking in children are 3-10 years, with </p><p>heavier sentences of 10-20 years or life for more serious </p><p>crimes involving organized criminal activity, trafficking </p><p>abroad, for "despicable or inhuman" purposes, for </p><p>prostitution, for trafficking more than one child, or a </p><p>repeat offense.  No changes were made in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>C.  The penalty for rape is 2-7 years imprisonment, or 5-10 </p><p>years if it involves a victim age 16-18.  If it involves </p><p>organized criminal activity, gang rape, a repeat offense, </p><p>incest, or multiple victims, as well as if it results in 31%- </p><p>60% impairment of the victim, or if she is impregnated, the </p><p>penalty is 7-15 years.  Rape can be a capital offense if the </p><p>victim commits suicide as a result, is infected with HIV, or </p><p>is left more than 61% impaired.  Rape of a child 13-16 years </p><p>old results in a 7-15 year sentence.  Any sexual intercourse </p><p>with a child under 13 years of age is considered rape; the </p><p>offender can be sentenced to 12 years to life or to death. </p><p>If the rape of a child 13-16 involves incest, a ward of the </p><p>offender, results in 31-60% impairment of the victim, or </p><p>impregnating the victim, the sentence is 12-20 years.  If </p><p>the rape of a child 13-16 years old involves organized </p><p>criminal activity, a repeat offense, gang rape, impairment </p><p>greater that 61%, commission of a crime when the offender </p><p>knows he is HIV positive, or leads to the suicide of the </p><p>victim, the punishment is 20 years to life or death.  No </p><p>changes were made in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>D.  See the statistics listed in the overview section </p><p>concerning court cases.  Unfortunately, these data are not </p><p>disaggregated according to numbers arrested and indicted. </p><p>Post has no information concerning the number of </p><p>convictions, although we presume it is high based on usual </p><p>judicial practice.  Nor has the GVN made available </p><p>information on the penalties actually applied to those </p><p>convicted.  UNODCP has discussed the possibility of </p><p>collecting crime statistics in an Office on Crime Statistics </p><p>in the Supreme People\'s Procuracy. </p><p> </p><p>E.  See 16. F.  MPS Criminal Police have reported that they </p><p>have detected increasing organized crime involvement in </p><p>trafficking in persons, but such criminal groups appear to </p><p>be specialized cells with informal links to other groups. </p><p>Most of them are not transnational in nature, but some have </p><p>used travel agencies, employment services, and marriage </p><p>brokerage services as fronts.  Based on this concern, the </p><p>GVN outlawed private marriage brokerage services during </p><p>2002.  The GVN also reviewed and tightened licensing </p><p>requirements for overseas employment services.  IOM reports </p><p>that anecdotal evidence suggests traffickers are often </p><p>individual brokers, who link up with more organized groups </p><p>outside Vietnam.  DEA confirms that most Vietnamese </p><p>traffickers are independent agents or working in small </p><p>unorganized groups.  There is little evidence that GVN </p><p>officials are actively involved in trafficking.  There is </p><p>little or no information on where profits from trafficking </p><p>in persons are being channeled. </p><p> </p><p>F.  The GVN actively investigates cases of trafficking that </p><p>come to its attention.  GVN authorities have worked with </p><p>foreign law enforcement officials, including the INS and the </p><p>Australian Federal Police, to investigate and interdict </p><p>trafficking cases, including fraudulent adoptions. </p><p>According an INS official in Vietnam, this cooperation has </p><p>progressed so that not only do GVN officials react to tips </p><p>and queries, but also seek advice and collaboration on </p><p>suspected cases.  Cooperation continued to improve in 2002. </p><p>However, GVN authorities apparently do not pursue detection </p><p>of trafficking in persons with the same intensity as they do </p><p>other crimes, such as narcotics trafficking, that appear to </p><p>them more clearly to threaten their national interests.  In </p><p>large part, this is because the magnitude of the problem is </p><p>not, in the authorities\' judgment, great enough to warrant </p><p>the resources such an effort would require. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnamese law enforcement does not use special </p><p>investigative techniques in trafficking investigations.  The </p><p>GVN takes the position that such techniques are not </p><p>specifically authorized under Vietnamese law.  In November </p><p>2000, the GVN changed the law to permit the use of such </p><p>techniques, but only for narcotics investigations, effective </p><p>June 1, 2001. </p><p> </p><p>G.  The limited training for GVN officials on investigation </p><p>of trafficking in persons has been given primarily to border </p><p>guards. </p><p> </p><p>H.  Yes.  GVN authorities work closely with countries within </p><p>the INTERPOL and ASEANPOL frameworks.  Vietnam has entered </p><p>into bilateral agreements with China and Australia </p><p>concerning cooperation in combating crimes including </p><p>trafficking in woman and children.  Significant cooperation </p><p>has yet to materialize with China, although observers state </p><p>both sides genuinely appear to be working toward that goal. </p><p>Vietnam also cooperates bilaterally with a number of its </p><p>neighbors via anti-crime agreements, extradition treaties, </p><p>and mutual criminal justice assistance undertakings, all of </p><p>which could apply to pursuing trafficking cases.  The GVN </p><p>also works with a number of international organizations, </p><p>such as UNICEF, UNDP, and ECPAT, to increase protection </p><p>provided to women and children. </p><p> </p><p>I.  Post is not aware of that Vietnam has been asked to </p><p>extradite persons charged with trafficking in other </p><p>countries, whether third country nationals or its own </p><p>citizens.  Vietnamese law does not prohibit extradition of </p><p>its own nationals. </p><p> </p><p>J.  See 16. H. </p><p> </p><p>K.  The GVN and the CPV have formally made fighting official </p><p>corruption a priority.  (See 17. H.)  Despite increasingly </p><p>high profile prosecutions, Vietnam\'s anti-corruption </p><p>campaign is not yet highly credible, comprehensive, or </p><p>effective.  Contacts in and out of the GVN, as well as some </p><p>media reports, indicate that individual low- and mid-level </p><p>officials have at times facilitated trafficking.  There are </p><p>anecdotal reports of GVN officials caught and tried for </p><p>involvement in trafficking cases, but Post has no systematic </p><p>or detailed information to substantiate such reports.  MOJ </p><p>officials noted four such cases in 2002, but admitted that </p><p>their knowledge is incomplete.  Certainly, as in other areas </p><p>involving corrupt officials, more can and should be done </p><p>systematically to pursue and prevent cases of official </p><p>involvement. </p><p> </p><p>L.  Vietnam ratified Convention 182 on November 17, 2000. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnam is studying the steps necessary to ratify ILO </p><p>Conventions 29 and 105 on forced or compulsory labor. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnam has ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention </p><p>on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child </p><p>Prostitution, and Child Pornography. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnam is studying the necessary legal and systematic </p><p>changes to sign and implement the Optional Protocol to </p><p>Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, </p><p>Especially Women and Children of the TNOC. </p><p> </p><p>19.  Protection and Assistance to Victims: </p><p> </p><p>A.   The GVN provides assistance to some victims of </p><p>trafficking.  The Women\'s Union and CPFC have established </p><p>rehabilitation programs to help treat, counsel, and </p><p>reintegrate trafficking victims, and receive some </p><p>international technical and financial support.  (Note:  The </p><p>USG funds IOM assistance to several such centers. The USG- </p><p>funded ILO-IPEC Child Labor project includes a small rescue </p><p>initiative aimed at trafficked children in urban areas. End </p><p>note)  These organizations clearly want to expand their </p><p>efforts, but have only limited domestic funding. </p><p>Independent GVN agencies like the CPFC are seriously under- </p><p>funded.  Mass organizations, like the Women\'s Union, </p><p>typically must generate most of their own funds through </p><p>dues, economic activities, or securing funding from foreign </p><p>organizations.  Therefore, the CPFC and the Women\'s Union </p><p>will likely continue to seek additional domestic and foreign </p><p>funding to pursue victim protection, rehabilitation, and </p><p>reintegration.  Services provided (for some returnees from </p><p>Cambodia and China) included temporary shelter, vocational </p><p>training, small loans to start businesses, medical </p><p>treatment, and sometimes counseling.  As part of its planned </p><p>anti-trafficking project, the Asia Foundation will work with </p><p>the MOJ\'s Legal Assistance Department to provide legal </p><p>counseling to trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p>However, some GVN officials tend to focus on engaging in </p><p>prostitution as a "social evil" rather than viewing the </p><p>prostitutes as victims. </p><p> </p><p>B.   The GVN and mass organizations such as the Women\'s </p><p>Union have provided in-kind assistance to rehabilitation </p><p>projects funded by international donors.  Generally, </p><p>assistance flows the other way, from foreign NGOs and donors </p><p>to GVN entities. In general, the GVN\'s and mass </p><p>organizations\' in-kind contributions include human resources </p><p>and logistical support and occasionally office space.  The </p><p>Women\'s Union has used some of its own resources to fund </p><p>prevention and victim rehabilitation work, but generally </p><p>waits until the international funding is no longer available </p><p>and then uses its very limited funds to sustain the efforts. </p><p> </p><p>C.   In general, the GVN seeks to assist trafficking </p><p>victims, and it does not generally treat victims as </p><p>criminals.  Sometimes victims are prosecuted because of </p><p>engagement in prostitution, but as noted above, prosecution </p><p>usually is focused on women who voluntarily engage in </p><p>commercial sex related activities.  In Vietnam, those found </p><p>guilty of engaging in prostitution are not jailed with </p><p>criminals.  Rather, MOLISA runs 40-plus facilities, commonly </p><p>referred to as rehabilitation or re-education centers, where </p><p>prostitutes receive medical treatment, vocational training, </p><p>and "improved social values."  Generally, those caught </p><p>engaging in prostitution -- voluntarily or as victims of </p><p>trafficking -- are sent to these centers for 3 months to 1 </p><p>year, and they are not free to leave until the designated </p><p>term is up.  MOLISA officials have pointed out that many </p><p>choose to stay well beyond these periods because they do not </p><p>want to return to prostitution but are uncertain of their </p><p>ability to support themselves outside or are hesitant to </p><p>return to their home communities.  They also noted that the </p><p>vast majority voluntarily engaged in commercial sex work. </p><p>While some GVN officials appeared aware that trafficked </p><p>women, by contrast, did not enter prostitution voluntarily </p><p>and are victims, GVN officials have justified the obligatory </p><p>terms such victims can be required to spend in such centers </p><p>on public health grounds, saying that 80% of prostitutes </p><p>entering these centers are infected with one or more </p><p>sexually transmitted diseases and must be treated. </p><p> </p><p>While no outside experts with whom emboffs have had contact </p><p>believe that these camps are effective, much less </p><p>appropriate, for victims of trafficking, experts have </p><p>pointed out that no commercial sex workers are imprisoned </p><p>under GVN policy.  Nor do they have criminal records. </p><p>Trafficking victims are not immediately returned to their </p><p>communities, where they would likely be treated as outcasts </p><p>and run the risk of being trafficked again.  The experts </p><p>would much prefer to see more victims\' assistance programs, </p><p>such as those run by the Women\'s Union and the CPFC.  The </p><p>experts noted that the more experience GVN authorities have </p><p>with victim\'s assistance programs, the more the authorities </p><p>prefer to put trafficking victims into such programs.  But </p><p>without sufficient funds to expand these programs, GVN </p><p>authorities have few alternatives to the above-mentioned </p><p>institutions. </p><p> </p><p>D.   We are not aware whether victims are encouraged to </p><p>assist in the investigation or prosecution of cases. </p><p>Technically, victims have a number of means to seek civil </p><p>action against their traffickers.  There are also means for </p><p>victims to pursue criminal action.  Vietnamese law expressly </p><p>requires criminal offenders to compensate their victims. </p><p>Post is not aware of any case in which a victim\'s access to </p><p>such legal redress has been impeded.  (See 18. A. for </p><p>efforts to provide legal assistance to victims.)  Experts </p><p>have observed that trafficking victims are often reluctant </p><p>to speak to police about the crimes committed against them, </p><p>however.  NGOs have received commitments from the Women\'s </p><p>Union and MPS\'s Criminal Police to receive training for </p><p>community-level personnel in interviewing techniques to </p><p>encourage victims to report crimes that they might be </p><p>unwilling to speak about. </p><p> </p><p>E.   The GVN, in concert with NGOs, provides some shelter, </p><p>such as temporary housing, for some returnees from China and </p><p>Cambodia.  Article 19 of the Criminal Procedure Code allows </p><p>a closed trial when necessary to protect victims\' privacy, </p><p>but there are no other legal protections for victims or </p><p>witnesses.  We are not aware of any case of a witness being </p><p>threatened. </p><p> </p><p>F.   Some GVN officials receive training on how to assist </p><p>victims.  However, because training funding is scarce, the </p><p>achievements of such training are limited.  Vietnamese </p><p>embassies and consulates abroad are charged with the </p><p>protection of Vietnamese citizens in their jurisdictions. </p><p>The GVN continues to seek to expand training to foreign </p><p>embassy and consulate personnel. </p><p> </p><p>G. Yes, the GVN provides assistance to victims as described </p><p>above. </p><p> </p><p>H.   Radda Barnen (Save the Children-Sweden) and Save the </p><p>Children-UK work on public education, advocacy, and </p><p>assistance to trafficked children.  CARE and Family Health </p><p>International help provide assistance to trafficked persons </p><p>who have HIV.  The Asia Foundation initiated an anti- </p><p>trafficking project and has applied for G/TIP funding to </p><p>expand it to other provinces in Vietnam.  While not NGOs, </p><p>IOM, ILO, UNDP, UNODCP, and UNICEF are actively providing </p><p>assistance to the GVN in trafficking in persons, some of </p><p>which is supported through USG funding.  A domestic quasi- </p><p>NGO, the Center for Reproductive and Family Health, works in </p><p>the prevention and victims\' assistance areas and is actively </p><p>soliciting international funds to do more.  As with all NGO </p><p>and international donor activities in Vietnam, cooperation </p><p>with local officials depends on long, patient relationship </p><p>building.  Several organizations, such as IOM, have </p><p>succeeded in identifying and developing close working </p><p>contacts with key community leaders, such as Women\'s Union </p><p>representatives in key border provinces. </p><p> </p><p>End response to questions. </p><p>Burghardt </p><p></p></div>
