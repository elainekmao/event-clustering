<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000216 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POL -- FOR J. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 DECL 01/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DIFFERENT INSIDER VIEWS ON THE PDP </p><p>CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: The PDP convention was a study of </p><p>rough-hewn politics. All participants agree the </p><p>convention was not for the faint-hearted; but they </p><p>also give differing, sometimes conflicting, versions </p><p>of what happened. We probably will never fully know </p><p>the complete truth because so much was blurred by the </p><p>hectic pace of events and distorted by the person\'s </p><p>political bias. However, we can state with confidence </p><p>that the actual vote count did not accurately reflect </p><p>the heated competition at the convention. Less than </p><p>one day before the vote, delegates were more evenly </p><p>divided between Ekwueme and President Obasanjo. The </p><p>power of incumbency and the liberal use of pay-offs </p><p>tipped the scale in Obasanjo\'s favor, turning what </p><p>looked like a close race on January 4 into an Obasanjo </p><p>landslide by the morning of January 5. What follows </p><p>are observations of the convention by three insiders. </p><p>We provide them to afford Washington a view of what </p><p>many players perceived as what happened behind the </p><p>scenes and not necessarily as the complete picture of </p><p>what transpired at the convention.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>From Inside The Villa </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) While the voting was being conducted at the PDP </p><p>convention late into the night of January 5, PolCouns </p><p>met Tunji Abayomi (strictly protect), Obasanjo\'s </p><p>private attorney before the President assumed </p><p>Nigeria\'s highest office.  Now an informal advisor to </p><p>the President, Abayomi described a panicky President </p><p>and coterie the previous day. Obasanjo and his aides </p><p>were caught off-guard when, on the eve of the </p><p>convention, PDP state governors decided to abandon the </p><p>President.  Confronted with this betrayal, Obasanjo </p><p>issued an "all hands-on-deck" call.  Responding to </p><p>this mayday, Abayomi spent most of January 4 at the </p><p>Villa huddling with numerous Obasanjo advisors, </p><p>confidants and friends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The President was dazed, Abayomi recalled. </p><p>Jarred by the unexpected possibility of defeat, the </p><p>usually know-it-all Obasanjo eagerly solicited counsel </p><p>on how to escape the closing vise.  Early that day, </p><p>the dominant theme was to seek a court injunction </p><p>postponing the convention.  Proponents suggested the </p><p>delay to afford Obasanjo time to marshal support and </p><p>undermine Ekwueme\'s momentum.  However, this idea was </p><p>ultimately discarded, partially because of </p><p>apprehension over the public\'s reaction.  More </p><p>importantly, the push for an injunction became less </p><p>urgent when the President\'s advisors began to sense </p><p>their man was regaining ground by the hour. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The President owed much of his recovery to his </p><p>own tenacity and, at times, shamelessness.  He pulled </p><p>out virtually all the stops to clinch the nomination, </p><p>according to Abayomi. For most of that day, the </p><p>President\'s diet consisted of liberal portions of </p><p>humble pie. The President pleaded and cajoled; on at </p><p>least two occasions his eyes welled with emotion as he </p><p>pursued fence-sitting delegates and governors. </p><p>However, Obasanjo saved his best to keep Vice </p><p>President Atiku from defecting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) With rumor swirling that Atiku would opt to </p><p>run with Ekwueme, Obasanjo wasted no time visiting the </p><p>Vice President\'s residence.  Obasanjo begged, </p><p>declaring he would not leave Atiku\'s home unless the </p><p>Vice President accompanied him to win back the </p><p>delegates and governors.  The performance had the </p><p>desired effect.  Atiku joined Obasanjo in publicly </p><p>lobbying the conventioneers.  While it might not have </p><p>been Obasanjo\'s finest hour it was the defining moment </p><p>of the convention.  What had been a suspenseful </p><p>contest would now turn into a rout. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Abayomi thought the convention had taught </p><p>Obasanjo some valuable lessons. The President learned </p><p>that victory was a collective effort but defeat was </p><p>solitary; the President, despite all the trappings of </p><p>office and the buzz of advisors, was a frightened and </p><p>lonely figure much of January 4.  Abayomi thought </p><p>Obasanjo would show more humility and act less </p><p>imperiously as a consequence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  However, Abayomi admitted Obasanjo could </p><p>easily learn the wrong lessons from the convention </p><p>victory. The events could reinforce the notion that </p><p>the coercive powers of his office are a President\'s </p><p>chief assets.  Abayomi admitted the pleading and </p><p>cajolery would not have worked without the underlying </p><p>threat that, even if he lost the convention, Obasanjo </p><p>still would retain the presidency for another five </p><p>months.  During that period, he could wreck the </p><p>political ambitions of those who sided against him. </p><p>It was this reality that kept the Vice President in </p><p>line and with him, the governors, and ultimately the </p><p>delegates.  All things being equal, Ekwueme would </p><p>probably have won the convention, Abayomi contended. </p><p>Obasanjo was disliked by most of the political elite, </p><p>while most people think highly of Ekwueme, he said. </p><p>However, the conventioneers\' fear of Obasanjo </p><p>ultimately corralled their respect for Ekwueme.  The </p><p>convention boiled down to a street fight between a </p><p>hard-nosed bully and a reserved intellectual.  In the </p><p>end, the bully won. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>The View From The Ekwueme Group </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) During a January 9 conversation with DCM and </p><p>PolCouns, Alhaji Isaiku Ibrahim, Ekwueme\'s campaign </p><p>coordinator, fulminated that Obasanjo cheated his way </p><p>to victory. Ibrahim\'s delegate count the morning of </p><p>January 5 revealed a virtual dead heat between </p><p>Obasanjo and Ekwueme; thus, Ekwueme\'s camp anticipated </p><p>a second ballot not an Obasanjo first round landslide. </p><p>Ibrahim acknowledged that throughout January 4 and </p><p>into the early hours of January 5, Ekwueme\'s fortunes </p><p>began to crumble. He cited several reasons for the </p><p>change. First, Obasanjo\'s camp generously showered </p><p>delegates and governors with money. Ibrahim contended </p><p>governors were given 30 million Naira each while every </p><p>delegate received at least 1,000 dollars.  The </p><p>Obasanjo campaign, not the PDP, paid for the </p><p>delegates\' hotel rooms.  Ibrahim claimed Obasanjo\'s </p><p>team required so much money to pass around that the </p><p>Central Bank and Habib Bank kept their doors open </p><p>Friday and Saturday nights. (Comment: Money was </p><p>certainly passed around at the convention, but </p><p>Ibrahim\'s figures are high even by Nigerian standards. </p><p>More importantly, Ekwueme\'s team should not protest </p><p>too loudly. Ekwueme received support from former Head </p><p>of State Babangida; if Babangida is in the mix, money </p><p>cannot be too far behind. There were numerous reports </p><p>that Ekwueme\'s team also paid for delegate support. </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Early on Saturday, Obasanjo was in deep </p><p>trouble and he knew it, maintained Ibrahim. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s campaign rousted a High Court judge from </p><p>his sleep to prepare the ground for an ex parte motion </p><p>to enjoin the convention.  Ibrahim said Obasanjo\'s </p><p>minions dropped this idea after the angry judge chided </p><p>that their antics not only disturbed his sleep but </p><p>also his professional integrity; if they filed the </p><p>motion, he would summarily deny it, the judge </p><p>promised. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Ibrahim claimed Obasanjo\'s campaign then began </p><p>tinkering with delegate accreditation.  They </p><p>successfully padded the delegate lists of some states </p><p>while substituting new lists for other states.  He </p><p>asserted this manipulation of delegate lists </p><p>demonstrated that the PDP machinery was not neutral, </p><p>but an adjunct of the Obasanjo campaign. PDP chairman </p><p>Audu Ogbeh had compromised his integrity, declared </p><p>Ibrahim. (Comment: Others say that Ogbeh had saved the </p><p>day and that it was VP Atiku who wanted to cancel the </p><p>convention to afford himself more time to a way to </p><p>ease Obasanjo out and take first place on the ticket </p><p>without infuriating the President.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The Ekwueme team\'s biggest complaint was the </p><p>vote counting procedures at the convention.  The party </p><p>had agreed to conduct the vote by secret ballot, </p><p>ostensibly to minimize the fear of intimidation. </p><p>However, Obasanjo\'s team used numbered ballots to </p><p>achieve the very thing (intimidation) the secret </p><p>ballot was to eliminate.  The numbered ballots were </p><p>the tip of an elaborate scheme to intimidate </p><p>delegates, according to Ibrahim.  He claimed Ekwueme </p><p>had been hoodwinked by Ogbeh, who ironically was </p><p>Ekwueme\'s campaign manager in the 1980\'s.  Prior to </p><p>the convention, Ogbeh had guaranteed he would keep the </p><p>ballot paper close-hold to prevent tampering.  Because </p><p>of their past relationship, Ekwueme trusted Ogbeh. </p><p>Thus, Ekwueme did not request to examine the ballot </p><p>papers prior to the convention.  This was an </p><p>irreparable mistake, Ibrahim asserted.  With the </p><p>ballots numbered, the President\'s team could determine </p><p>how each delegate voted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Ibrahim maintained the President and Vice </p><p>President pressured the governors to deliver their </p><p>states or risk the overturn of their own re- </p><p>nominations. In turn, the governors put their feet on </p><p>the neck of their respective state chairmen. The state </p><p>chairmen were told to record the numbered ballots </p><p>given to each delegate; more ominously, they were </p><p>instructed to make sure the delegate knew a ledger was </p><p>being kept so that their votes could be traced, </p><p>maintained Ibrahim. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Even with these devices, the Obasanjo-Atiku </p><p>team was not completely sure of victory.  They </p><p>continued to pressure governors as the vote was being </p><p>conducted.  Ibrahim claimed VP Atiku cornered Niger </p><p>Governor Kure, reminding Kure a favor was owed.  The </p><p>Vice President reminded Kure, an Obasanjo foe and a </p><p>friend of former Head of State Babangida, that Atiku </p><p>has supported Kure for renomination in Niger while </p><p>Obasanjo and the rest of the party hierarchy backed </p><p>Commerce Minister Bello.  Calling in his chip, Atiku </p><p>said now was Kure\'s time to reciprocate.  Unless he </p><p>backed the Obasanjo-Atiku ticket,  Atiku threatened </p><p>that both he and Obasanjo would make Kure\'s life </p><p>unbearable.  Ibrahim also described Kaduna State </p><p>governor Makarfi as waffling.  Prior to the </p><p>convention, Makarfi met Ekwueme and personally pledged </p><p>to deliver Kaduna\'s delegates.  After being threatened </p><p>by Obasanjo, Makarfi reversed direction.  While other </p><p>states were voting, Makarfi reportedly gathered </p><p>several key delegates from Kaduna pleading with them </p><p>to return to Obasanjo.  Makarfi said he would "lose </p><p>his job" if Kaduna did not vote Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Ibrahim maintained that most delegates </p><p>recognized Ekwueme was better qualified and </p><p>intellectually superior to Obasanjo. However, he </p><p>accused Obasanjo of scare tactics and bullying his way </p><p>to victory. Ibrahim had no kind words for VP Atiku. </p><p>Ibrahim felt Atiku was the person who most influenced </p><p>the convention due to the relationship with the </p><p>governors.  Atiku disliked Obasanjo but listened to </p><p>expediency\'s counsel and stuck with the President. </p><p>Atiku ultimately was too frightened that Obasanjo </p><p>would ruin him if he defected, Ibrahim asserted. </p><p>Obasanjo needed Atiku now.  But given Obasanjo\'s </p><p>history of ingratitude and untrustworthiness, Ibrahim </p><p>predicted Obasanjo would dump Atiku after the general </p><p>election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Because of the perceived irregularities with </p><p>the convention. Ekwueme\'s camp had not "recognized" </p><p>the result.  Ibrahim stated they were undecided </p><p>whether to quit the party or to continue to challenge </p><p>the convention results from within.  Whatever decision </p><p>is made, will be done as a bloc, he said. (Note: </p><p>Ekwueme filed a lawsuit to overturn the convention </p><p>results. The court denied his request for a temporary </p><p>injunction prohibiting the PDP from referring to </p><p>Obasanjo as the winner.  However, the court will still </p><p>hear the substantive issues raised in Ekwueme\'s suit </p><p>at a later date.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>One Governor\'s Perception </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) In a post-convention discussion with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Kaduna Governor Makarfi asserted </p><p>that Ekwueme\'s candidacy was never a serious threat to </p><p>Obasanjo.  The report that he and other governors had </p><p>shifted to Ekwueme was a complete feign.  The </p><p>governors leaked the story to "teach Obasanjo a </p><p>lesson" to end his autocratic ways.  Makarfi said </p><p>Ekwueme\'s candidacy was ill fated because he </p><p>procrastinated by waiting to announce his candidacy a </p><p>mere one month before the convention.  He logically </p><p>could not have expected to catch Obasanjo within such </p><p>a brief time.  Second, Ekwueme erred by canvassing </p><p>delegates independently instead of first talking to </p><p>the governors who resented being short-circuited. </p><p>Ekwueme learned the hard way that the governors </p><p>control the state machinery, Makarfi said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Last, many governors opposed Ekwueme because </p><p>he had never explicitly repudiated a proposal he </p><p>published in 1994 to reshape Nigeria into a </p><p>confederation of relatively autonomous regions.  This </p><p>proposal, coupled with the fact that Ekwueme might be </p><p>sympathetic to Igbo secessionists, caused governors to </p><p>fear an Ekwueme presidency could occasion the </p><p>dismemberment of Nigeria.  (Comment:  Makarfi\'s </p><p>points, particularly the belated concern about the </p><p>1994 confederation proposal, seem somewhat contrived. </p><p>It seems that Makarfi was trying to put the best gloss </p><p>on his vacillations during the convention. End </p><p>comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>What A Convention It Was </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) By all accounts, the convention was spirited </p><p>drama.  The day before the vote was a day of high </p><p>anxiety. Obasanjo and Ekwueme\'s fortunes waxed and </p><p>waned several times that day.  Vice President Atiku </p><p>occupied an extraordinary position.  If any one person </p><p>determined the outcome, it was Atiku. However, his </p><p>situation was bittersweet.  Courted by both Obasanjo </p><p>and Ekwueme, he could do no worse than emerge as the </p><p>Vice Presidential candidate; however, he also could do </p><p>no better. Atiku recognized the irony of his position, </p><p>although he certainly did not enjoy it.  Meanwhile, </p><p>the PDP governors affirmed that they were powerful </p><p>players, yet, in the end they did not buck the </p><p>President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) Backslapping, back-room deals, and </p><p>backtracking from promises made were all represent and </p><p>well accounted for during the convention.  This was a </p><p>classic lesson in hardball politics.  Throughout the </p><p>convention, principle was told to sit still and behave </p><p>while the players cut and uncut deals unmolested by </p><p>any tinge of conscience.  The convention was about </p><p>people protecting and promoting their narrow </p><p>interests.  Political conventions traditionally are </p><p>not profiles in rectitude but contests of ambition, </p><p>avarice and advantage.  This one was no different.  It </p><p>was both worse and better than it could have been. </p><p>Competition was limited to political tricks and </p><p>treachery -- there was no violence or physical </p><p>intimidation.  Money exchanged hands but probably in </p><p>lesser amounts than in 1999.  For all its demerits, </p><p>the convention was what realistically could be </p><p>expected for a second edition of a party convention in </p><p>a fledgling democracy like that of Nigeria. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
