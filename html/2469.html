ON FEBRUARY 5, ITALY\'S HEALTH AUTHORITIES </p><p>REACTED TO THE FIRST SUSPECTED CASE OF THE </p><p>HUMAN VERSION OF MAD COW DISEASE, NEW VARIANT </p><p>CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE (NVCJD).  THE </p><p>PATIENT IS A 25 YEAR OLD SICILIAN WOMAN FROM </p><p>TRAPANI. ITALY\'S MINISTER OF HEALTH GIROLAMO </p><p>SIRCHIA AND THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE </p><p>GIANNI ALEMANNO BOTH APPEARED ON TELEVISION </p><p>NEWS WITH ASSERTIONS THAT MEAT IN ITALY IS </p><p>SAFE NOW, THAT THE SYSTEMS TO CHECK BSE ARE </p><p>IN PLACE AND ADEQUATE, AND THAT THIS INCIDENT </p><p>IS A CASE THAT HAS HAD A LONG INCUBATION </p><p>PERIOD.  THE QUESTION OF THE DAY IS HOW THE </p><p>ITALIAN PUBLIC WILL RECEIVE THESE MESSAGES. </p><p>ITALIANS\' LEVEL OF TRUST IN GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>GOI EFFORTS TO ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT IT IS </p><p>SAFEGUARDING HEALTH, MAY SUFFER FROM THIS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THERE CERTAINLY IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT </p><p>THE AFFLICTED WOMAN CONTRACTED THE DISEASE </p><p>FROM MEAT CONSUMED IN ITALY.  GOI STATEMENTS </p><p>FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT THE CONTAGION MIGHT </p><p>HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN ITALY AT A TIME WHEN NEW </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00607  01 OF 02  071617Z </p><p>VARIANT CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB WAS UNKNOWN AND </p><p>PRECAUTIONS NOW TAKEN TO CONTROL THE DISEASE </p><p>IN CATTLE HAD NOT YET BEEN TAKEN.  THE FIRST </p><p>ITALIAN COW TESTING POSITIVE TO BOVINE </p><p>SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY (BSE) WAS </p><p>DISCOVERED IN JANUARY, 2001.  TESTING IN </p><p>ITALY HAS BEEN OBLIGATORY SINCE THEN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE AFFLICTED WOMAN SUSPECTED AS ITALY\'S </p><p>FIRST HUMAN CASE OF NVCJD WAS ADMITTED TO THE </p><p>HOSPITAL ABOUT ONE MONTH AGO. HER DIAGNOSIS </p><p>WAS CONFIRMED BY TESTS CONDUCTED AT THE </p><p>LONDON COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, BUT ONLY POST </p><p>MORTEM TESTS ARE CONCLUSIVE IN CASES OF </p><p>NVCJD, WHICH IS CONSIDERED FATAL. IF THE </p><p>ITALIAN PATIENT SUCCUMBS TO WHAT TURNS OUT TO </p><p>BE NVCJD, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST CONFIRMED </p><p>HUMAN CASE TO HAVE OCCURRED IN ITALY. </p><p>ALTHOUGH OTHER SUSPECTED CASES HAVE BEEN </p><p>REPORTED PREVIOUSLY IN THE ITALIAN PRESS, </p><p>NONE HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED.  SINCE ITS </p><p>DISCOVERY IN 1986, APPROXIMATELY 100 DEATHS, </p><p>MORE THAN NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF WHICH HAVE </p><p>OCCURRED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONFIRMED FROM THE DISEASE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE SUPPORTS A CAUSAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BSE AND NVCJD BUT LITTLE </p><p>IS KNOWN ABOUT THE INCUBATION PERIOD BETWEEN </p><p>EXPOSURE TO THE INFECTIVE AGENT AND THE </p><p>EMERGENCE OF SYMPTOMS. PARTICULARLY IN ITALY, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00607  01 OF 02  071617Z </p><p>MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT BSE AND CONFUSION OF THE </p><p>DISEASE WITH THE UNRELATED FOOT AND MOUTH </p><p>DISEASE (FMD) IN CATTLE, CONTRIBUTE TO PUBLIC </p><p>SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SENSATIONAL JOURNALISM ON </p><p>ANIMAL DISEASE AND ITS CONNECTIONS TO HUMAN </p><p>HEALTH.  ITALIANS DO NOT HAVE A WELL GROUNDED </p><p>TRUST IN THEIR AUTHORITIES AND THEY ARE NOT </p><p>INCLINED TO TURN TO THE GOI TO BRING THEM </p><p>RELIABLE INFORMATION. BY WAY OF CONTRAST, IN </p><p>THE U.S. RECENT SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION </p><p>INCLUDING THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE HARVARD RISK </p><p>ASSESSMENT ON BSE, IS PUBLISHED ON THE </p><p>WEBSITES OF THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL, </p><p>THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND THE US </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, ALL OF WHICH ARE </p><p>FREQUENTLY USED BY THE PUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE FIRST CASES OF MAD COW IN ITALY WERE </p><p>DISCOVERED IN 1994 IN IMPORTED CATTLE.  THESE </p><p>CASES WERE FOUND IN TRAPANI WHEN TWO COWS </p><p>AMONG A HERD IMPORTED FROM BRITAIN WERE FOUND </p><p>TO TEST </p><p>POSITIVE TO BSE  ALTHOUGH THE HERD </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ7476 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00607  02 OF 02  071616Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------638FF2  071616Z /38 </p><p>R 071553Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 2014 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 1996 </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000607 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USDA FOR FAS/CMP/DLP/SINDELARE </p><p>CMP/GFD/RIEMENSCHNEIDER; CMP/COT/LBLUM </p><p>ITP/EAMED/MACKE/RICHEY </p><p>OFSTS/LHARBERT/APHIS/ATORRES </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR, ALSO AGRICULTURE </p><p>MILAN FOR PRINCIPAL OFFICER </p><p>FLORENCE FOR PRINCIPAL OFFICER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00607  02 OF 02  071616Z </p><p>NAPLES FOR PRINCIPAL OFFICER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, EU, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: FIFTYFOURTH CASE OF BSE IN ITALY </p><p> </p><p>WAS SEIZED, SOME ANIMALS WERE STOLEN AND </p><p>PRESUMABLY ILLEGALLY SLAUGHTERED.
