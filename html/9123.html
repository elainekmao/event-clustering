<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001671 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, G/TIP, and DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KCRM, KWMN, SNAR, PGOV, SOCI, VM, CNARC, TIP </p><p>SUBJECT:  An Giang:  TIP Problem Depends on Point of View </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  An Giang local government and mass </p><p>organization officials do not agree on the seriousness of the </p><p>Trafficking in Persons (TIP) in their province.  Women\'s Union </p><p>and the Department of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs </p><p>(DOLISA) officials portray a fairly serious problem while local </p><p>police say they detect one or two cases a year involving three or </p><p>four victims each.  NGO\'s have generally depicted An Giang as a </p><p>TIP hotbed.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Criminal Police:  TIP not really a problem here </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Lt. Col. Nguyen Van Minh met poloff, Congen EconJO and </p><p>FSN at the provincial criminal police office in Long Xuyen to </p><p>discuss TIP in An Giang province.  Lt. Col. Minh said that about </p><p>100 criminal police and local officers are specifically </p><p>responsible for preventing TIP-related crimes in An Giang. </p><p>According to Lt. Col. Minh there are only about two TIP cases a </p><p>year, usually involving one, sometimes two traffickers and three </p><p>or four victims.  He added that there might be a few more small- </p><p>scale traffickers operating in the province, but expressed </p><p>confidence that police were catching almost all traffickers.  He </p><p>said that traffickers usually trick women into thinking that they </p><p>can get jobs in Cambodia.  As far as police knew, he clarified, </p><p>only local people were involved in human trafficking.  While </p><p>asserting that the human traffickers were not involved with other </p><p>illegal activity, he admitted that police did not know about any </p><p>connections the traffickers might have in Cambodia.  Convicted </p><p>human traffickers receive sentences of ten years or more if the </p><p>victim is under seventeen, but if not and it is a first offense, </p><p>the prison sentence is usually only two years, according to Lt. </p><p>Col. Minh. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Provincial police only cooperate with district-level </p><p>police to investigate traffickers, not with Cambodian authorities </p><p>or even with GVN border guards.  Despite many claims to the </p><p>contrary, Lt. Col Minh said that An Giang was not being used as a </p><p>transit route from other provinces to Cambodia.  An Giang is also </p><p>a source of many Vietnamese brides who have gone to Taiwan.  Lt. </p><p>Col. Minh said that police have not investigated these because </p><p>they are legal marriages. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>But there is a drug problem </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  In contrast, Col. Lam Minh Huynh, who said he was in </p><p>charge of An Giang\'s counter-narcotics efforts, there is a </p><p>"complicated" drug problem in the province.  (Note:  Col. Huynh </p><p>said that he has attended an ILEA training in Bangkok.  End </p><p>note.)  Many young people were addicted and the number was </p><p>increasing, particularly in rural areas.  It was difficult to </p><p>stop traffickers because the border with Cambodia is relatively </p><p>open, and if things get too hot on one side, they can cross over </p><p>easily.  Since Thailand began its "crackdown" against drug </p><p>dealers, things have been getting better in An Giang, although </p><p>Col. Huynh admitted that he did not know why. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>DOLISA:  It is hard to tell who has been trafficked </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Provincial DOLISA Director Nguyen Thi Nga described her </p><p>department\'s efforts to prevent TIP and assist victims.  She </p><p>explained that An Giang did not have a mechanism to track the </p><p>number of TIP victims, but added that the provincial People\'s </p><p>Committee decided the problem was sufficiently severe that they </p><p>held a meeting to coordinate a response to the problem.  DOLISA\'s </p><p>primary task was to help TIP victims and women who had willingly </p><p>gone to Cambodia -- and for whatever reason decided to engage in </p><p>prostitution there -- to reintegrate into the community upon </p><p>their return.  Director Nga indicated that tens of women were </p><p>involved in DOLISA\'s programs.  However, these programs are open </p><p>to a variety of women in difficult circumstances, not just TIP </p><p>victims.  (Note:  It was not clear whether Director Nga included </p><p>women who went to Cambodia willingly and were subsequently </p><p>tricked into prostitution as TIP victims, although this may be </p><p>considered trafficking under current Vietnamese law.  End Note.) </p><p>She explained that it was difficult to tell who was a TIP victim, </p><p>because there were women who had gone to Cambodia for legitimate </p><p>employment or business reasons.  Some of them had subsequently </p><p>fallen on hard times.  A few of these may have then been tricked </p><p>into prostitution and thus become TIP victims, but many had </p><p>engaged in prostitution voluntarily.  Regardless, as returnees, </p><p>they were eligible for assistance. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Without catching the traffickers "redhanded" it was </p><p>difficult to prove trafficking, she said.  Contrary to MPS, </p><p>Director Nga said that there was considerable cross border TIP in </p><p>An Giang, mostly involving people lured from other provinces. </p><p>She added that nine TIP victims have been repatriated through </p><p>diplomatic channels to Binh Thanh Dong district.  Among them were </p><p>three women who were not from that district or even apparently </p><p>from An Giang.  It was even possible that the three were actually </p><p>ethnic Vietnamese Cambodian citizens.  Per an interministerial </p><p>agreement Director Nga said, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is </p><p>attempting to find the families of these women.  While the other </p><p>women are participating in DOLISA reintegration programs, these </p><p>three are staying in a DOLISA-run social welfare center in Long </p><p>Xuyen. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  DOLISA is working with a French NGO, Terre des Hommes </p><p>(TDH), on an anti-TIP program in Binh Thanh Dong and Phu Tan </p><p>districts called "Women and Child Trafficking Prevention Across </p><p>the Border" Director Nga said.  These are deemed the most </p><p>vulnerable areas because women there have been tricked.  The </p><p>programs address job creation, hunger alleviation and poverty </p><p>eradication.  Some women have received training in sewing and </p><p>obtained jobs in garment factories, while 20 others went to Can </p><p>Tho University to learn advanced agricultural skills that they </p><p>are teaching to their neighbors.  While some of the beneficiaries </p><p>are returned trafficking victims, others are eligible because </p><p>they are part of vulnerable groups. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Director Nga declared that education, not poverty was </p><p>the main problem behind TIP in An Giang.  Most victims had little </p><p>education and little awareness of TIP.  She said victims </p><p>generally had Grade Five or Six educations, at the most.  Higher </p><p>education levels and more awareness of TIP would be key not only </p><p>to eliminating TIP, but to eradicating poverty and hunger too. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------- </p><p>Women\'s Union:  mass organization makes massive education effort </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Nguyen Ngoc Mai, head of the An Giang provincial Women\'s </p><p>Union (WU) delivered a prepared statement about TIP  while other </p><p>senior members of the WU and the provincial Committee on </p><p>Population, Families, and Children (CPFC) looked on, nodding in </p><p>agreement.  Ms. Mai said that unsettled economic conditions and </p><p>frequent flooding in An Giang contribute to "social evils" </p><p>including TIP.  Women are "deceived" and "cheated," especially to </p><p>go to Cambodia.  Others claim to be "tricked" into marrying </p><p>foreigners, especially Taiwanese.  When they have been able to </p><p>return they have said that they were not treated as "wives." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  While the WU has not done research and does not know </p><p>the number of victims, Ms. Mai said that victims have revealed </p><p>that women usually cross the Cambodian border "unofficially" with </p><p>friends who say they can get them a job as a nanny, cafe girl, or </p><p>maid.  Others are similarly tricked to going to cities in </p><p>Vietnam.  Sometimes traffickers invite victims to come with them </p><p>to "visit family and friends in Cambodia," but deliver them to </p><p>brothels where they are held against their will instead.  Ms. Mai </p><p>said that not all of the women are tricked into crossing the </p><p>border or into prostitution, some of them simply have exercised </p><p>poor judgment, are lazy, or think they can get rich quickly. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Protecting women and children from "social evils" such </p><p>as TIP is a "high priority" of the WU, the GVN, and the Communist </p><p>Party of Vietnam (CPV), Ms. Mai declared, adding that such ills </p><p>are bad for "social order, family and spiritual happiness, and </p><p>are prohibited by the laws of Vietnam."  The GVN and mass </p><p>organizations have targeted lending, housing, employment, </p><p>agricultural production, and education programs to fight these </p><p>evils, she noted.  The An Giang WU works on step-by-step TIP </p><p>awareness-raising, especially in remote rural areas where people </p><p>have little access to print media or even radio and television. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Ms. Mai explained that with assistance from the </p><p>national WU, the An Giang WU held nine courses between May 2002 </p><p>and May 2003 for 470 trainers to raise awareness of TIP.  The </p><p>trainers have focused their efforts in 14 communes.  They </p><p>distributed 57,000 leaflets in these communes and conducted </p><p>11,400 meetings with 216,000 An Giang women.  They have organized </p><p>competitions with district-level WU to role-play the negative </p><p>effects of TIP.  A result, Ms. Mai claimed, was to increase an </p><p>initial set of 134 groups -- comprising 1,461 women who had </p><p>committed to not allowing their children to become TIP victims -- </p><p>to 634 groups comprising 9,735 women who have made this </p><p>commitment. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  The provincial WU gives "direct" assistance to at-risk </p><p>women, enabling them to enter poverty-reduction programs that </p><p>have created 5,000 jobs, conducted 18 sewing and other vocational </p><p>training courses, and led to the creation of 1,130 "loan groups" </p><p>comprising 18,999 women, according to Ms. Mai. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Ms. Mai also described a cooperative program the An </p><p>Giang Women\'s Union has been undertaking with the International </p><p>Organization for Migration (IOM) since 2001 to assist with victim </p><p>reintegration.  One component has been to train 30 WU and CPFC </p><p>staff members to locate victims -- including those who have </p><p>returned through unofficial channels -- and help them through the </p><p>process of reintegration.  Female community elders are key to </p><p>this because their respected community positions allow them to </p><p>confidentially approach victims who are otherwise unwilling to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>admit that they have been trafficked.  First approaches may be </p><p>through victims\' parents, but in other cases the community worker </p><p>may decide it is best to keep the victim\'s history from the </p><p>family.  The goal of such intervention is to try to stabilize the </p><p>victims\' lives, according to Ms. Mai.  She commented that this </p><p>may mean helping some victims accept their "difficult lives", and </p><p>that they must make money "the hard way" as well as manage their </p><p>own budgets. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  Comment:  The three differing outlooks outlined above </p><p>say as much about institutional interests as they do about the </p><p>state of the TIP problem in An Giang.  NGOs and IOs active in </p><p>anti-TIP efforts in Vietnam generally consider An Giang\'s problem </p><p>to be relatively serious, but have yet to reliably estimate how </p><p>large.  Provincial authorities did really not shed any light on </p><p>the scale of the problem either.  The stigma victims and near- </p><p>victims may face, even from an organization such as the WU that </p><p>is trying to combat TIP, discourages them from coming forward. </p><p>Less judgmental points of view are becoming more common, </p><p>sometimes in unexpected quarters, such as DOLISA, and continued </p><p>cooperation and attention to TIP should produce more productive </p><p>outlooks and results.
