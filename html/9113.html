<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001147 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>STATE PASS AF/W, INR, EB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EPET, ENRG, PGOV, ASEC, CASC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POLICE KILL FOUR DEMONSTRATORS; STRIKE </p><p>CONTINUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 1135 (B) ABUJA 1107 (C) ABUJA 1091 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary:  The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) strike </p><p>entered its second day with reports of sporadic violence, </p><p>including four people apparently killed near Abuja. </p><p>Nevertheless, the general mood is less tense than it was </p><p>during the strike\'s first day.  Some domestic flights resumed </p><p>today, and the major oil companies report no interruption in </p><p>their operations.  Efforts to resolve the strike continue, </p><p>with NLC leaders and the Presidency meeting from the </p><p>afternoon of June 30 to the early morning of July 1.  No </p><p>resolution to the impasse was achieved, but the Government </p><p>and NLC did agree to establish a "technical committee" that </p><p>will draft recommendations to end the crisis.   The country </p><p>remains mostly calm.  However, as long as the strike </p><p>continues, the possibility of altercations between police and </p><p>strikers exists and political tensions could escalate.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Four Strikers Killed and 88 Jailed in Abuja </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) GON officials confirmed to Poloff that police killed </p><p>four people attempting to block a road in one of Abuja\'s </p><p>satellite towns on June 30.  Initially, the press reported </p><p>that police confirmed the deaths then later retracted the </p><p>statement, claiming to have no information that strikers were </p><p>shot.  NLC officials claimed (and eyewitness accounts tend to </p><p>corroborate) that live ammunition was used during the </p><p>encounter in the satellite town.  Eighty-eight protesters </p><p>were arrested in Abuja yesterday.  Many labor leaders were </p><p>detained temporarily. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) An Embassy police source reported heavy security and </p><p>military patrols in major cities.  Embassy sources in Kano, </p><p>Kaduna, Zaria, Sokoto and throughout the North reported that </p><p>banks, shops and markets remained closed.  Non-unionized </p><p>private sector industries, however, were operating as usual. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Police Lock Down NLC Headquarters </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Senior NLC official Salihu Lukman confirmed to Econoff </p><p>that police sealed off NLC Headquarters in Abuja this morning </p><p>for several hours.  An NLC advisor complained President </p><p>Obasanjo was trying to intimidate the NLC. By locking down </p><p>the NLC Headquarters (traditionally a rallying point for </p><p>strikers) the President hoped to stop labor-led protests, the </p><p>official stated.  NLC senior official Benson Upah also </p><p>claimed that police fired tear gas and live ammunition at a </p><p>vehicle carrying Oshiomole this morning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Crude Still Flowing </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Members of NUPENG, the blue collar oil workers union, have </p><p>joined in the strike.  A Lagos-based Exxon-Mobil official </p><p>reports the strike has not disrupted oil production, and </p><p>exports continue apace. A Shell representative also reported </p><p>no production disruptions due to the strike. At this time, </p><p>PENGASSEN, the skilled petroleum worker\'s union, has not </p><p>joined the strike but will likely make a decision following a </p><p>meeting in Abuja today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lagos and the South Calm </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Lagos remained quiet and mostly calm.  While most </p><p>businesses remained closed, some shopping centers were open. </p><p>Lagos\' mainland region, where the bulk of Lagosians live, </p><p>experienced a second morning of scattered violence, with </p><p>gangs of young men burning tires and intimidating drivers </p><p>going to work. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) There was noticeably increased police presence. There </p><p>were also reports of police clashing with bands of strike </p><p>sympathizers at key intersections early Tuesday morning. On </p><p>Ikoyi and Victoria Islands, the focal point of the financial </p><p>and services sectors where most diplomatic missions are </p><p>located, the strike was having virtually no impact other than </p><p>the closure of some businesses and a welcomed reduction in </p><p>traffic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Ogun, the President\'s home state, is reportedly "shut </p><p>down" today due to the strike.  The situation in the </p><p>South-South also appears quiet.  Port Harcourt experienced </p><p>minor incidents of violence. Most residents stayed home, but </p><p>some gas stations were operating and drivers were queuing for </p><p>fuel. Civil servants appeared for work on Tuesday in larger </p><p>numbers than on Monday.  Warri appeared no more tense than </p><p>usual in recent months, and no specific acts of violence or </p><p>clashes have been reported. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Air Travel Resumes, but Some Flights Canceled </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Most domestic airlines claimed they were operating </p><p>normally on domestic routes Tuesday morning, but passengers </p><p>reported many canceled flights.  Officials of the National </p><p>Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) and Air Transport </p><p>Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN) </p><p>reported that their attempts to shut down flight operations </p><p>had been unsuccessful.  Some disruptions were reported, but </p><p>air traffic controllers, for the most part, elected not to </p><p>strike.  An NLC official reported they were planning to block </p><p>all the routes leading to the Lagos airport to prevent </p><p>passenger access. (Comment: Such an action would likely be </p><p>met with stiff police and security response. End Comment.) </p><p>On Monday morning, an attempt to chain the gates of the </p><p>airport was easily overcome by airport security. There was </p><p>reportedly no shortage of jet-fuel at Nigeria\'s airports </p><p>today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The Nigerian Stock Exchange operated normally on </p><p>Monday, but volumes were low because some dealers were </p><p>absent. Nonetheless, banking shares in particular remained </p><p>actively traded, with analysts reporting a generally positive </p><p>mood overall in the securities market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) On its second day, the strike continues to complicate </p><p>may normal business activities throughout Nigeria.  But the </p><p>atmosphere is less expectant today than yesterday and it is </p><p>too early to determine whether the strikers will be able to </p><p>hold out or if their action has had such an economic impact </p><p>that it would cause government to want a quick resolution by </p><p>sharply reducing their price increase.  Nevertheless, the </p><p>proposed technical committee may be a face-saving device for </p><p>both Labor and the Government wherein a compromise price is </p><p>reached, allowing each side to claim a victory of sorts. </p><p>This is precisely how a similar nation-wide strike over a </p><p>petrol price increase was settled a few years ago.  In the </p><p>end, and no matter how gallant labor fights, a petrol price </p><p>increase is inevitable.  That said, the price increase will, </p><p>in the short term, result in higher food and transportation </p><p>costs, stretching the naira even thinner for most Nigerians. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
