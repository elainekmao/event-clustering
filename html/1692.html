<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001048 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PBTS, MASS, SL, GV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: OBASANJO ON LIBERIA SANCTIONS, CONTE AND THE RUF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ABUJA 959 </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  President Obasanjo told Ambassador Jeter May 5 that </p><p>he was increasingly optimistic that the GOSL and the RUF </p><p>could reach an accommodation.  At the conclusion of their </p><p>visit to Abuja (reftel), the two sides had decided to </p><p>return to Sierra Leone on the same aircraft.  Obasanjo </p><p>opined that the RUF had made a shrewd choice in bringing </p><p>Omrie Golley forward as their leader.  He had not been </p><p>impressed with Issa Sesay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Obasanjo said he planned to tell Charles Taylor </p><p>that ECOWAS would support UN sanctions and that these would </p><p>be "nothing" by comparison to what would come if Taylor did </p><p>not change his behavior. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Nigeria  President sought U.S. assistance to </p><p>encourage Lansana Conte toward greater flexibility. </p><p>Obasanjo believed that, at this point, Guinea  President </p><p>(who did not send a representative from Conakry or even </p><p>from the Guinean Mission in Abuja), was exhibiting </p><p>"unreasonable intransigence." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
