<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BRUSSELS 002375 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INL/PC; DOJ FOR OIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AINF, KCRM, KJUS, EUN, USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>SUBJECT: EUROPOL - U.S. COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.    The mission of Europol (the European Police </p><p>Office) has steadily expanded from its initial focus on </p><p>fighting drugs to encompass all serious crimes, including </p><p>terrorism, illicit migration, trafficking in persons, child </p><p>pornography, money-laundering and counterfeiting of the Euro. </p><p> Within the last year and a half the U.S. has signed two </p><p>cooperative agreements with Europol.   While it is expected </p><p>that the initial flow of information will largely be from the </p><p>USG to Europol, these agreements will allow the U.S. to </p><p>develop a deepening cooperative relationship as Europol grows </p><p>in stature within the EU and acquires a more expansive role </p><p>in police work.  This is being submitted as part of the </p><p>Mission\'s reporting plan.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Mission and Function of Europol </p><p> </p><p>2.  Europol is an evolving police institution of the European </p><p>Union whose primary mission at this time is to facilitate the </p><p>coordination and cooperation of member states in the field of </p><p>criminal law enforcement.  At the present time it has limited </p><p>operational authority and its personnel do not arrest people </p><p>or engage in searches and seizures.  Europol operates under </p><p>its own Convention which came into force on October 1, 1998. </p><p>Europol commenced its full activities on July 1, 1999. </p><p>Membership in Europol is part of the acquis; accordingly, all </p><p>accession countries will be members of Europol as part of </p><p>their obligation to adhere to the EU institutions and </p><p>principles.  Through the pooling of information and data </p><p>concerning those aspects of crime which affect two or more of </p><p>their members, Europol is able, in theory at least, to </p><p>provide all members with better insight into the crime </p><p>problem they face and how best to respond to it.  Europol\'s </p><p>"added value" to member states, in theory, lies in its </p><p>ability to perform critical analysis and to render </p><p>coordinative assistance to member states in fighting </p><p>primarily transnational organized crime and terrorism.  Under </p><p>the Europol convention, all members must assign one or more </p><p>"liaison" officers to Europol headquarters in The Hague and </p><p>ensure that these officers have access on line to the various </p><p>police databases maintained by their respective country. </p><p>Noteworthy is the fact that member states are not pooling </p><p>their databases but merely making them potentially accessible </p><p>in one centralized location in The Hague.  Within a </p><p>relatively short period of time, Europol has evolved from a </p><p>small entity with jurisdiction limited to the drug area to </p><p>its present jurisdiction over all serious crimes, including </p><p>terrorism, illicit migration, trafficking in persons, child </p><p>pornography, and money-laundering, with primary jurisdiction </p><p>over counterfeiting of the Euro.  Europol is funded by </p><p>contributions from the EU Member States according to their </p><p>GNP.  Its 2003 budget is Euro 55.5 million.  There are </p><p>currently 386 staff members from all Member States.  Of </p><p>these, 59 are Europol Liaison Officers representing a variety </p><p>of law enforcement agencies (police, customs, gendarmerie, </p><p>immigration services, etc.)   The Directorate of Europol is </p><p>appointed by the Council of the European Union.  The </p><p>Directorate currently consists of Director Jurgen Storbeck </p><p>(German) and Deputy Directors Willy Bruggeman (Belgium) and </p><p>Mariano Simancas (Spain). </p><p> </p><p>3.  Europol has improved its international law enforcement </p><p>cooperation by signing bilateral agreements with the </p><p>following non-EU states and international organizations:  the </p><p>European Central Bank, the European Monitoring Center on </p><p>Drugs and Drug Addiction, Iceland, Norway, and the World </p><p>Customs Organization.  It is currently in negotiations with </p><p>Canada. </p><p> </p><p>Europol\'s Weakness </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Europol Convention is an extremely complex </p><p>instrument.  It contains precise and cumbersome rules </p><p>concerning the handling of personal data, reflective of the </p><p>Union,s collective fears of massive human rights violations </p><p>by police organizations, which are not usually closely </p><p>controlled.  While obviously a worthy objective, the rules </p><p>are so stringent with respect to the handling of personal </p><p>data as to make it extremely difficult for the organization </p><p>to function effectively.  It is suggested that the same </p><p>objectives could be accomplished in a more efficacious </p><p>fashion so as to strike a more appropriate balance between </p><p>the security needs of the nation and the protection of human </p><p>rights. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Europol depends on others to provide it with the raw data </p><p>which form the basis of its analytical work.  However, a </p><p>critical tenet of the Convention is that member states retain </p><p>control over their own data and dictate what is to be shared </p><p>with Europol and with member states through the Europol </p><p>process.  Thus member states can and do withhold information </p><p>from Europol, which impedes its ability to perform its </p><p>assigned tasks.  Nowhere is this more dramatically seen than </p><p>in the field of terrorism where, following the September 11 </p><p>attack, the JHA ministers publicly criticized their own </p><p>organizations for not sharing critical data on terrorism with </p><p>Europol.  Europol can only propose investigations to member </p><p>states but cannot compel such inquiries.  Europol cannot send </p><p>out its officials to conduct interviews, perform searches or </p><p>make arrests.  Europol is generally disliked if not despised </p><p>by many EU member police organizations.  These organizations </p><p>tend to resent Europol,s existence and view it as criticism </p><p>of their own efforts at coordination, which they maintain, </p><p>have worked effectively over the years.  In this regard, it </p><p>should not be forgotten that Europol is a political creation </p><p>and its establishment was not driven by perceived needs of </p><p>law enforcement but rather the political desire for greater </p><p>integration in the JHA arena.  The JHA ministers are </p><p>consistently conferring more and more jurisdiction on </p><p>Europol.  It is likely that the new EU Constitution (due to </p><p>be unveiled in June 2003) will provide Europol with some </p><p>limited operational role as well as the authority to order a </p><p>country to commence an inquiry.   Over time, Europol could </p><p>evolve into the nucleus of a federal EU police structure. </p><p> </p><p>Relations with the United States </p><p> </p><p>6.  In a relatively short period of time we have been able to </p><p>conclude and put into effect two agreements with Europol </p><p>which provide a legal basis for exchanging all forms of </p><p>information, including personal data.   An outgrowth of the </p><p>events of 9/11, the initial agreement between the U.S. and </p><p>Europol was signed in Brussels in December, 2001, to enable </p><p>the sharing of strategic data and to facilitate cooperation </p><p>on joint threat assessments.  The logical next step was a </p><p>follow-on agreement to allow the exchange of personal data. </p><p>The stringent data privacy restrictions imposed by Europol\'s </p><p>Convention, monitored by its Joint Advisory and Management </p><p>Boards, tempered assessments of the potential success of the </p><p>negotiations.   These concerns were eventually addressed to </p><p>the satisfaction of Europol\'s data protection counselors and </p><p>the second agreement was signed in Copenhagen in December, </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>7.  We are in the process of implementing these agreements </p><p>with all U.S. law enforcement agencies.  Last year the JHA </p><p>ministers directed that Europol open a liaison office in </p><p>Washington.  In August, two officers arrived in Washington to </p><p>take up this assignment.  The precise terms of reference for </p><p>these officers are being developed on an interagency basis. </p><p>There is agreement within the USG that the National Crime </p><p>Bureau (NCB) in Washington should be the point-of-contact for </p><p>Europol.   However, tensions still exist regarding the </p><p>exchange of information concerning terrorism; Europol wants </p><p>access to more case-related information.  The U.S. does not </p><p>have a liaison officer assigned to Europol. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Comment.    Europol\'s critical analysis of transnational </p><p>crime data coming from two or more EU Member States is an </p><p>"added value" to  bilateral law enforcement agreements which </p><p>can provide information from only a single national </p><p>perspective.   At least in the short run, it is anticipated </p><p>that U.S. agencies will be providing more data to Europol </p><p>than it will provide us.  Nevertheless,  the two U.S. </p><p>agreements will allow us to develop a deepening cooperative </p><p>relationship with Europol as it grows in stature within the </p><p>EU.   This will prove useful in our joint fight against </p><p>terrorism.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SCHNABEL </p><p></p></div>
