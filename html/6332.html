<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000491 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SCUL, PGOV YM </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR VISITS ADEN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.    (U) Summary: Ambassador visited Aden, the financial </p><p>capital of Yemen, March 9 to 10 to check on several U.S. </p><p>government sponsored projects and to carry the public </p><p>diplomacy message that, Yemeni interests are well served by a </p><p>strong relationship with the U.S. regardless of Iraq. Locally </p><p>based media were with the Ambassador at each stop and </p><p>provided wide and positive coverage to the visit. Many Yemeni </p><p>media and other contacts have commented to us favorably this </p><p>week on the fact that the U.S. Embassy has not drawn down its </p><p>staff and remains positively, and publicly, engaged in </p><p>promoting development and bilateral cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (U) Visit with the Governor of Aden: On his arrival on </p><p>the morning of Sunday, March 9, the Ambassador drove directly </p><p>from the airport to the Governor,s office to begin his very </p><p>busy day of visits.  In a half-hour conversation, the two </p><p>covered a variety of topics, including economic and social </p><p>development, security at the Port of Aden, the U.S. assisted </p><p>development of the Yemeni Coast Guard, the upcoming </p><p>parliamentary elections in April and the participation of </p><p>women in the process and other issues.  The Governor thanked </p><p>the Ambassador for the U.S. interest in and assistance to </p><p>Aden. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (U) Opening of the Computer Center at the Yemen </p><p>Women,s Association: The Ambassador then moved on to the </p><p>Aden center of the Yemen Women,s Association to officially </p><p>open their new computer center which was financed with a </p><p>grant from the Public Diplomacy Section of the U.S. Embassy. </p><p>The computer center now has ten state-of-the-art computers </p><p>with networking capability and has become a busy place </p><p>training women in computer skills. Embassy Sanaa,s </p><p>Information Resource Director Helmi Noman provided technical </p><p>help in helping set up the computer center as well as trained </p><p>the staff as trainers. The Ambassador was briefed on the work </p><p>of the Association and visited the organization,s three-year </p><p>pre-school facility for the children of working mothers.  The </p><p>children entertained the Ambassador and his entourage with </p><p>recitations and songs. </p><p> </p><p>4.    (U) Visit to the School Desk Factory: The Ambassadorial </p><p>motorcade then moved on to the &General Establishment for </p><p>Furniture and School Equipment,8 where 150 thousand school </p><p>desks are being manufactured for schools all over Yemen </p><p>financed through 416(b) funds ($5.4m).  Each desk bears the </p><p>Embassy,s &Gamariyya8 (traditional Yemeni motif </p><p>incorporating the American flag) that has become a highly </p><p>visible symbol of U.S.-Yemeni development cooperation. </p><p>Director Fadhel Saleh Al-Hilali led a tour of the factory to </p><p>show the various stages of the production.  The Ambassador </p><p>walked by the desks at various states of completion sometimes </p><p>piled as high as the ceiling.  The next day, newspapers </p><p>carried photographs of the Ambassador standing next to those </p><p>mountains of desks as well as trucks laden with the desks </p><p>destined for various regions of the country. </p><p> </p><p>5.    (U) Visit to &Al-Ayyam8 Newspaper: The Ambassador </p><p>then visited the editorial offices of the largest selling </p><p>newspaper in the country, the privately-owned independent </p><p>&Al-Ayyam8 to meet with the publisher and the </p><p>Editor-in-Chief and to give a wide-ranging interview.  The </p><p>interview, which was published in full in the Tuesday, March </p><p>11 issue of the newspaper, covered topics under security and </p><p>development in Yemen, as well as the Iraq and Palestine. </p><p>Following the meeting, the Ambassador and his entourage were </p><p>hosted for lunch by the publisher and owner of the newspaper, </p><p>Hisham Bashraheel. (Complete translated text of the </p><p>Ambassador,s interview sent septel). </p><p> </p><p>6.    (U) Visit to the &College of Light8 School for the </p><p>Blind: The Ambassador,s last visit for the day was to the </p><p>&College of Light8 School for the Blind which was renovated </p><p>and equipped with a grant of more than $130 thousand from </p><p>416(b) funds.  The Ambassador received a briefing on the work </p><p>of the School and visited some classrooms where he chatted </p><p>with students. </p><p> </p><p>7.    (U) Reception: In the evening, the Ambassador hosted a </p><p>reception for Mission contacts in Aden at the Sheraton Gold </p><p>Mohur Hotel located at the center of the picturesque Elephant </p><p>Bay. More than 65 people, representing government, business, </p><p>NGOs, the Yemeni Coast Guard, the foreign consular corps and </p><p>the media were present at the gathering.  The Governor of </p><p>Aden, Taha Ahmed Ghanem, came with his entourage and stayed </p><p>for a long time, conversing with the Ambassador and others. </p><p> </p><p>8.    (U) Visit to the Coast Guard Facilities: On Monday, </p><p>March 10, the Ambassador visited the sites of the Coast Guard </p><p>operations and training bases.  Captain Robert Innes, the </p><p>U.S. maritime advisor to the ROYG, guided the tour.  First, </p><p>from the watchtower hill in the city, the Ambassador got a </p><p>panoramic view of the proposed operations base.  Later, he </p><p>visited the proposed operations base and then took a long </p><p>tour of the training base which is located some distance from </p><p>the former. </p><p> </p><p>9.    (U) Visit to the Aden Community College:  The </p><p>Ambassador,s last visit was to the Aden Community College, a </p><p>three-year American-style vocational-technical school which </p><p>was established about three years ago and is scheduled to </p><p>produce its first graduates this May.  The College is trying </p><p>to maintain a flexible profile in providing graduates with </p><p>practical skills which are needed in the actual job market. </p><p>The Public Diplomacy Section of the Embassy has been </p><p>assisting the College by providing books and providing </p><p>computer training.  PD Sanaa has also requested an English </p><p>Teaching Fellow for the College.  The College administration </p><p>hosted a lunch for the Ambassadorial group following the </p><p>briefing. </p><p> </p><p>10.   (U) Comment: One of the main purposes of the trip was </p><p>to promote the public diplomacy aims of creating a positive </p><p>image for the Mission in Aden in particular and in Yemen in </p><p>general during a tense period in the region. The media </p><p>coverage of the visit was wide and very positive.  The most </p><p>prominent Aden daily, &Al-Ayyam8 reported that they sold </p><p>additional copies during the first day of coverage and some </p><p>key selling points sold out copies of the newspaper the day </p><p>the Ambassador,s interview appeared. During the </p><p>well-attended reception at the end of the first day both </p><p>American officers and FSNs were told by many local attendees </p><p>that while other foreign missions were leaving Yemen, it was </p><p>refreshing and reassuring that the U.S. Mission was not only </p><p>staying on, but remained actively and publicly engaged in </p><p>prmoting development programs and bilateral cooperation. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
