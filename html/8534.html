<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001158 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS AND INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MASS ACTION IN ZIM; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The week-long mass action, called by the opposition </p><p>      Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) aimed at </p><p>      forcing Robert Mugabe to address the economic and </p><p>      political crisis afflicting the country, remains the </p><p>      mainstay for editorials being carried in the </p><p>      mainstream media.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "The final nail on the economy" the </p><p>      independent daily "The Daily News" (06/06) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The government\'s forcible opening of companies </p><p>      heeding the opposition mass action to stay shut this </p><p>      week and threats to deregister these firms could be </p><p>      the final nail on an economy already on the brink of </p><p>      total collapse.  When the dust of the harsh </p><p>      clampdown on the mass action and on these companies </p><p>      has settled down, the cost of the government\'s high- </p><p>      handedness will only then unfold, and many in the </p><p>      administration could have a rude awakening. . .It is </p><p>      not the companies which will be the eventual losers </p><p>      in this high-stakes game, but the government itself, </p><p>      Zimbabwe and its people. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Regime clinging to power by force" the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Zimbabwe Independent" (06/06) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .If the MDC is unable to assemble its </p><p>      supporters in town centers, its leadership is at </p><p>      least able to call a successful strike whenever it </p><p>      likes.  No amount of threats by ministers. . .could </p><p>      get people to work. . .At the end of the week the </p><p>      impression that remained was one of a desperately </p><p>      insecure regime using every means at its disposal. . </p><p>      .to get the country back to work. . .The reality, </p><p>      which the world was able to observe this week, was </p><p>      of a regime that is only able to survive by brute </p><p>      force. . .We are all agreed that by its campaign </p><p>      this week the MDC has drawn the attention of the </p><p>      country and the world to the connection between </p><p>      brutal misrule and economic collapse.  That is the </p><p>      issue successfully dramatized by its followers in </p><p>      the teeth of repression and which can no longer be </p><p>      ignored, not even by the delusionist in State </p><p>      House." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "The West in discord" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" (06/06) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .While the Western self-appointed anointers of </p><p>      African rulers have consistently refused to `bless\' </p><p>      our President\'s victory in the 2002 election, the </p><p>      same `angels. . .,\' have decided to see legitimacy </p><p>      in the mass action organized by MDC, when the action </p><p>      was declared illegal by the High Court. . .The </p><p>      Western governments decide to close their eyes so </p><p>      that they see no evil and hear no evil.  They are </p><p>      mum about the beatings of demonstrators in their </p><p>      backyards but are quick to chastise Zimbabwe for </p><p>      breaking up demonstrations organized by a party that </p><p>      is in possession of a High Court order outlawing the </p><p>      action. . .The people of this country will never </p><p>      surrender their sovereignty to a bunch of leaders </p><p>      who have never been elected by Zimbabweans. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
