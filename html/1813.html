THE </p><p>SUMMIT LEADERS ISSUED AN EGREGIOUSLY IMBALANCED </p><p>DECISION ON LOCKERBIE THAT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN SLATED </p><p>FOR ISSUANCE AT MINISTERIAL LEVEL.  IN AN UNUSUAL </p><p>MOVE, THEY ISSUED THEIR OWN MILD DECLARATION ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE, SUPPLEMENTINQ -- BUT NOT SUPPLANTINQ -- THE </p><p>MINISTERS\' HARSHER DECISION (REFTEL).

CAMERAMEN FLOCKED </p><p>TO HIM, THE ZAMBIAN-GOVERNMENT-LED GALLERY GREETED HIM </p><p>WITH ULULATION, AND SPEAKERS SHOWERED HIM WITH PRAISE </p><p>FOR HIS ROLE IN BRINGING THE AFRICAN UNION INTO BEING. </p><p>ISRAELI MFA OAU CHIEF AMB. DORON GROSSMAN TOLD US </p><p>QADHAFI REFUSED TO ATTEND THE OPENING CEREMONY IF </p><p>THERE WAS AN ISRAELI IN THE ROOM, SO GROSSMAN -- WHO </p><p>COULD HAVE MADE A STINK -- GRACIOUSLY STEPPED OUT.  AT </p><p>THE CLOSING CEREMONY, QADHAFI WAS THE ONLY LEADER </p><p>INVITED TO SPEAK IN OTHER THAN A CEREMONIAL CAPACITY. </p><p>HIS ORATION WAS INTERRUPTED FOR A FEW MINUTES WHEN THE </p><p>LIGHTS SUDDENLY WENT OUT, BUT HE WAITED CALMLY AT THE </p><p>PODIUM UNTIL THEY CAME BACK ON.

BUT </p><p>WHEN BOTSWANA\'S PRESIDENT MOGAE CHALLENGED SUDAN ON </p><p>PRESENT-DAY SLAVERY IN THAT COUNTRY, QADHAFI TRIED TO </p><p>PAPER THINGS OVER BY CLAIMING THAT MOGAE DID NOT MEAN </p><p>TO ACCUSE KHARTOUM. </p><p> </p><p>4.
