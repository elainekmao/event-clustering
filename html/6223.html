O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI, ENGR </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe May Dollarize Energy </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Another pillar of the GOZ\'s mind- </p><p>withering, and failed, interventionist economic policies </p><p>may crumble. Parastatal Zesa is negotiating U.S. dollar </p><p>energy tariffs with selected exporters.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Differentiated Tariffs </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) While recently touring Gweru and Kwekwe </p><p>(Midlands), Econchief met with representatives of Sable </p><p>Chemicals, Zimasco and Zimbabwe Alloys.  They are the </p><p>country\'s 3 largest energy consumers, absorb 20 percent </p><p>of national output and have endured power shedding in </p><p>recent months.  Reps from Zimasco and Zim Alloys, both </p><p>exporters, told us Zesa has just approached them about </p><p>paying for energy in U.S. dollars.  The GOZ\'s recent </p><p>"National Economic Revival Program" broaches the idea of </p><p>some firms paying for energy in foreign exchange. </p><p>Managers of non-exporter Sable said Zesa has not pitched </p><p>them similar proposals.  The chemical company does not </p><p>earn forex directly and could not stay in business if </p><p>paying an international market price for power. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Even as forex-earners, Zimasco and Zim Alloys </p><p>told us they balked at Zesa\'s request that they pay US </p><p>3.8 cents per kilowatt hour.  Firms in Mozambique, </p><p>Botswana, Zambia and South Africa pay under US 2.0 cents. </p><p>The Zimasco plant manager said such rates "would blow us </p><p>right out of the water."  Both miners could swallow a </p><p>tariff equivalent to that in neighboring countries, a 5- </p><p>fold increase over present Zimdollar-denominated rates, </p><p>if Zesa guarantees them preferential service and a fair </p><p>exchange rate. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Over the long haul, energy prices that vary by 5- </p><p>fold are unsustainable.  Nevertheless, both Eskom of </p><p>South Africa and Hydro Cabora Basa of Mozambique have </p><p>threatened to cut off energy exports, a potentially </p><p>devastating blow to an ailing economy heavily dependent </p><p>on imported power.  More importantly, it is mildly </p><p>encouraging that the GOZ is finally thinking about fuel </p><p>and energy in dollarized rather than self-delusive -- </p><p>i.e., converted into Zimdollars at an unsupported </p><p>official rate -- terms. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
