<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 004236 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, KPAO, PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR ROSS\' MEETING WITH ISLAMISTS: A GOOD </p><p>OPENING </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA GREGORY L. BERRY FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On July 17, R Special Coordinator Ambassador Ross met </p><p>with Islamic Action Front (IAF) leaders Sheikh Hamza Mansour </p><p>(IAF Secretary General), Abdel Latif Arabiyat (IAF Shura </p><p>Council President), and Jamil Abu Bakr (IAF First Deputy </p><p>Secretary General).  Poloff accompanied Ambassador Ross.  IAF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>leaders welcomed Ross warmly even as they sharply criticized </p><p>U.S. policy.  The July 17 IAF meeting marked another </p><p>significant step in the restoration of contacts between the </p><p>Embassy and the IAF since they were disrupted two years ago </p><p>by visa issues involving prominent Muslim leaders.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>MORE DIALOGUE NECESSARY </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloff opened the July 17 meeting by acknowledging the </p><p>IAF\'s willingness to engage in dialogue, and noting that this </p><p>willingness had been a factor leading to the meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Ross.  Ambassador Ross expressed the </p><p>Administration\'s respect for Islam and stated the U.S.\'s </p><p>interest in continued dialogue with Islamist figures who </p><p>eschew violence and terror.  Ambassador Ross said the U.S. </p><p>had traditionally underestimated the importance of dialogue </p><p>with the Arab world in general and with the Islamist current </p><p>in particular, and asked IAF leaders for their views </p><p>regarding "the feelings of the Arab people regarding the </p><p>situation" and "the role of the U.S."  He also noted, </p><p>critically, that Muslims had allowed the September 11 </p><p>perpetrators to present themselves as if they were acting in </p><p>the name of Islam. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>ROSS\' VISIT "MAY BE A GOOD START" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As expected, Ambassador Ross\' affirmation of the need </p><p>for continued dialogue provoked sharp responses from IAF </p><p>leaders: </p><p> </p><p>- Arabiyat welcomed Ambassador Ross\' "positive outlook" and </p><p>said "Muslims condemned the acts of September 11."  However, </p><p>Arabiyat believes answers to questions about who perpetrated </p><p>the September 11 attacks can be answered by looking at who </p><p>benefited from the attacks (i.e., Zionists).  Muslims have </p><p>gained nothing while Zionists have gained the loyalties of 45 </p><p>million Americans, presumably including many conservative </p><p>Christians, who are "now mobilized . . . to serve Israel </p><p>under the pretext that Christ will return when Greater Israel </p><p>comes to exist."  Arabiyat also complained about what he </p><p>views as a bias against Muslims dating back to Nixon, and a </p><p>media warp that distorts American opinion in favor of Israel. </p><p> Perhaps because of this, Arabiyat said, America perilously </p><p>places "all its capabilities at the disposal of the Zionist </p><p>project" regardless of divergence between U.S. and Israeli </p><p>interests. </p><p> </p><p>- Turning more towards regional issues, Arabiyat claimed that </p><p>what little was built through the Oslo accords (opposed by </p><p>Islamists at the time of their signing) has been destroyed by </p><p>U.S. support for Sharon "the war criminal," whom the U.S. </p><p>calls "a man of peace."  Regarding Iraq, Arabiyat criticized </p><p>U.S. policy for supporting "a deadly siege" in Iraq on </p><p>grounds that Iraqis have weapons of mass destruction, yet </p><p>failing to "ask similar questions about the Jewish weapons of </p><p>mass destruction."  In answering Ambassador Ross\' question as </p><p>to why the Muslim masses had allowed persons like Bin Laden </p><p>to speak in their name, Arabiyat said the street "applauded </p><p>the acts of Bin Laden as an expression of their frustration </p><p>with U.S. policy, particularly in Iraq and Palestine."  At </p><p>the end of all this, Arabiyat optimistically concluded that </p><p>Ambassador Ross\' visit "may be a good start." </p><p> </p><p>- Mansour began by focusing closely on Ambassador Ross\' </p><p>statement that America had not done enough to promote </p><p>dialogue with Islamists.  According to Mansour, "things may </p><p>be well" if this is an Administration view and not just a </p><p>personal view held by Ambassador Ross.  Mansour then cited </p><p>Qur\'anic verses which, he said, show the September 11 </p><p>"attacks on non-Muslims (were) equally an attack on Islam" </p><p>and provide the basis for "our condemnation" of them.  But </p><p>Mansour blamed September 11 on the pro-Israeli bias of the </p><p>"U.S. Administration" and, most notably of all, its support </p><p>of Sharon.  "Over and above (giving Sharon the money and </p><p>weapons to kill Palestinians), you picked this man, who is </p><p>accursed by the ground on which he walks and describe him as </p><p>a man of peace."  As an aside, Mansour also complained that </p><p>it is not up to the U.S. to decide that Arafat and Saddam </p><p>Hussein should be replaced, though he and his colleagues do </p><p>not support either leader. </p><p> </p><p>- Next, Mansour focused on the realm of public diplomacy, by </p><p>addressing what he termed the "U.S. failure in persuading </p><p>Arabs and Muslims that Islam is not (the Americans\') target." </p><p> Again, Mansour laid the blame squarely on U.S. policy. </p><p>"You," he said, "are capable of occupying the whole world, </p><p>but you will not win our hearts except through justice.  We </p><p>may be weak and poor, but we have rights and are willing to </p><p>make sacrifices to defend them."  Mansour said he fears the </p><p>day when Arab anger boils over to the point that it "becomes </p><p>directed against all things American or Western" and people </p><p>widely say "Bin Laden is the solution."  Mansour believes </p><p>that the U.S. now stands at a historical moment, and </p><p>concluded by expressing hope that he had "presented a correct </p><p>picture" of the dire situation to Ambassador Ross. </p><p>- Mansour and Arabiyat both expressed anger and skepticism </p><p>concerning President Bush\'s June 24 speech.  They remain </p><p>unmoved by President Bush\'s references to Israeli withdrawal </p><p>from the West Bank and eventual creation of a Palestinian </p><p>state, which they juxtapose against past delays in reaching </p><p>both goals and America\'s recent "unleash(ing of) the criminal </p><p>Sharon, the man of massacres" with carte blanche authority </p><p>"to kill people, to kill women and children, (and) to change </p><p>the (Palestinian) leadership."  According to the IAF leaders, </p><p>the street has no faith in President Bush\'s vision because </p><p>its immediate effect is to provide Sharon with political </p><p>cover without giving anything palpable to Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p>- Abu Bakr predicted that moderate influences within Islam </p><p>and the Arab World will continue to weaken as long as the </p><p>U.S. supports Israel at the expense of the Arab rights. </p><p>Trends towards extremism will gather strength so long as U.S. </p><p>policy remains unjust and Arabic regimes remain illegitimate. </p><p> Picking up on the legitimacy point, Mansour added that </p><p>America must "respect the peoples\' choice" in Jordan (i.e., </p><p>by supporting parliamentary elections, in which many expect </p><p>Islamists to do well).  He criticized the lack of a sitting </p><p>Parliament and the GOJ\'s repeated delays in holding new </p><p>elections, saying he "knew" America had hypocritically </p><p>"blessed" this. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador Ross responded generally by noting the </p><p>Administration\'s realization that there exists a principled </p><p>Islamic world with which it should engage positively.  He </p><p>further emphasized our common desires for peace and justice </p><p>for all mankind.  The disagreement, as Ambassador Ross put </p><p>it, is over "the means to get there."  Ambassador Ross </p><p>expressed hope in finding a way "to interact positively with </p><p>the real Muslim ummah" on the goal of achieving peace and </p><p>justice, and concluded by acknowledging that we jointly have </p><p>"hard issues to work on."  Arabiyat applauded Ambassador </p><p>Ross\' remarks and expressed gratitude for his visit, saying </p><p>that he and his colleagues had been "looking for such an </p><p>opening and for this line of thinking." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>PRESS COVERAGE OF THE MEETING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Several Jordanian newspapers have published articles </p><p>about Ambassador Ross\' meeting with Islamists.  The </p><p>sensationalist weekly "Shihan" went so far as to assert that </p><p>the meeting took place "behind the Government\'s back," and </p><p>that it surprised local politicians given "the mounting U.S. </p><p>campaign against Arab and Islamic countries under the excuse </p><p>of combating terrorism."  Shihan also reported that </p><p>Ambassador Ross\' meeting is part of a regional USG effort to </p><p>"obtain information from Islamic communities . . . so as to </p><p>develop means of confronting Islamic movements."  The </p><p>Islamist weekly Assabeel has not covered the meeting at all, </p><p>even though articles like the one in Shihan may be calculated </p><p>to rouse the ire of more extreme Islamist elements opposed to </p><p>engagement with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) For his part, Sheikh Mansour has adopted a firm and </p><p>unapologetic tone in answering press questions about the </p><p>meeting.  When asked by Shihan, for example, if he feared </p><p>news of the meeting might infuriate the Islamist rank and </p><p>file, Mansour responded: "We were not in an entertainment </p><p>session.  We conveyed the message, which the Americans should </p><p>hear.  One of our party\'s aims is to express our stands." </p><p>Asked if there would be other meetings with Americans, </p><p>Mansour replied that he would have no reservations if "there </p><p>was an interest" in meeting and that "each case (involving </p><p>the possibility of a meeting) will be studied at its </p><p>appropriate time." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador Ross\' meeting with "moderate" leaders of </p><p>the IAF and Muslim Brotherhood was the most significant and </p><p>high-level USG contact with Islamists in Jordan in more than </p><p>two years.  While the bulk of the meeting focused on </p><p>criticisms of U.S. policy, Ambassador Ross offered the goal </p><p>of achieving peace and justice as a conceptual "opening" on </p><p>which future dialogue can build.  We anticipate that future </p><p>contacts will reveal more about the IAF\'s operations and </p><p>agenda in Jordan.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) This message was cleared by Ambassador Ross. </p><p>Berry </p><p></p></div>
