<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000366 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF/W FOR BOOTH </p><p>AF/RA FOR BITTRICK </p><p>NSC FOR FRAZER </p><p>OSD FOR TIDLER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, SENV, PHUM, PREF, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO - SPECIAL APPEAL TO </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. LAGOS 188 </p><p>     B. LAGOS 189 </p><p>     C. LAGOS 227 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 301 </p><p>     E. ABUJA 304 </p><p>     F. ABUJA 325 </p><p>     G. STATE 19427 </p><p>     H. STATE 20922 </p><p>     I. STATE 18807 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) President Obasanjo convoked Ambassador Jeter </p><p>(accompanied by DATT and PolMilOff) on February 4 and stated, </p><p>"Howard, we need help."  Explaining that he did not initially </p><p>realize the extent of the destruction caused by the explosion </p><p>at the Ikeja ammunition depot, the President said he was </p><p>making a special appeal to President Bush for assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The DATT explained that the joint EUCOM, UK, UN, </p><p>Nigerian Army EOD assessment team believed that clean-up of </p><p>unexploded ordnance would take two EOD companies six months </p><p>to one year, and that the affected areas of Ikeja and </p><p>Maryland would have to be isolated.  Obasanjo noted that, </p><p>while the British would help, they would only supplement </p><p>American efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador Jeter explained that with the present pace </p><p>of U.S. military operations, it was unclear to what extent we </p><p>could help, beyond the USD 25,000 in emergency disaster </p><p>funds.  We were also looking to provide some remaining </p><p>Operation Focus Relief supplies, if possible.  Noting that </p><p>efforts thus far were appreciated, Obasanjo said he would </p><p>also make the request to President Bush in writing.  He then </p><p>dictated some phrases to his assistant, including, "Thank you </p><p>for the condolences...I am asking for special assistance...we </p><p>do not have the technical capacity to deal with this disaster </p><p>and need assistance...we need a strong team for a </p><p>considerable amount of time." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The situation in Ikeja is much worse than President </p><p>Obasanjo first believed, and he now clearly realizes why his </p><p>initial reactions were seen as unfeeling.  Bombs continue to </p><p>cook-off with attendant injuries and deaths.  As more </p><p>citizens slip back into the affected areas, we can expect to </p><p>see additional injuries and deaths. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Nigerian military, though initially claiming to </p><p>have an EOD capability, does not.  Soldiers and police have </p><p>exacerbated the danger while attempting to clean up by </p><p>stacking unexploded ordnance, including leaking phosphorus </p><p>rounds.  Without sufficient assistance, the situation in </p><p>Ikeja and its environs will grow even more dangerous, and the </p><p>humanitarian, environmental and political fall-out will be </p><p>severe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) There is no doubt that the humanitarian needs are </p><p>great and that we could see a substantial loss of life if </p><p>something is not done quickly to clean up the ordnance spread </p><p>over a heavily populated area comprising between 50 and 200 </p><p>square kilometers.  More deaths will almost certainly lead to </p><p>political instability in Lagos, including within the Nigerian </p><p>army. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The British High Commissioner has told us that HMG </p><p>will help but does not have large numbers of specialists to </p><p>commit to this task. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Nigeria has a clear perception of a special </p><p>relationship with the United States, and made strong </p><p>statements of support for the U.S. after 9-11.  Moreover, </p><p>Nigeria has had a consistent policy of opposition to </p><p>terrorism, including early support for our engagement in </p><p>Afghanistan.  We hope that we can be responsive to Obasanjo\'s </p><p>appeal, which in this time of dire need, will symbolize for </p><p>many the litmus test of our bilateral relationship. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
