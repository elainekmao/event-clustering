(U) Local press reported on June 17 that the Abu </p><p>Dhabi Environmental Research and Wildlife Development </p><p>Agency (ERWDA) signed an agreement to cooperate on </p><p>environmental and wildlife protection with the </p><p>Bahraini General Commission for the Protection of </p><p>Marine Resources, Environment and Wildlife. The pact </p><p>runs for three years, and the UAE wildlife authority </p><p>agreed to work with its counterpart in Bahrain to </p><p>conduct research, manage and assess fish stocks, and </p><p>protect wild plants and endangered species. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment: This pact is a welcome development </p><p>as we have not seen any recent cross-border </p><p>collaboration on environmental issues. To meaningfully </p><p>manage the environment -- especially the heavily </p><p>depleted fish stocks of the Persian Gulf -- countries </p><p>in the region need to increase their level of </p><p>cooperation and coordination with each other (see </p><p>reftel).  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
