Sensitive but Unclassified--NOFORN--entire text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Following is the 2001 Country Report on Human Rights for </p><p>Nigeria </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Introduction </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria is a federal republic composed of 36 states and a </p><p>capital territory, with an elected president and a bicameral </p><p>legislature.  On May 29, 1999, President Olusegun Obasanjo of </p><p>the Peoples Democratic Party was inaugurated to a 4-year term </p><p>after winning elections in February 1999 that were marred by </p><p>fraud and irregularities perpetrated by all contesting </p><p>parties, but most observers agreed the elections reflected </p><p>the will of the majority of voters.  These elections marked </p><p>the end of 16 years of military-led regimes.  On May 5, 1999, </p><p>the Abubakar Government signed into law a new Constitution </p><p>based largely on the suspended 1979 Constitution; the new </p><p>Constitution entered into effect on May 29, 1999.  The </p><p>Constitution provides for an independent judiciary; however, </p><p>in practice the judicial remains susceptible to executive and </p><p>legislative branch pressure, is influenced by political </p><p>leaders at both the state and federal levels, and suffers </p><p>from corruption and inefficiency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Nigeria Police Force (NPF) is tasked with law </p><p>enforcement.  The Constitution prohibits local and state </p><p>police forces.  Internal security is the duty of the State </p><p>Security Service (SSS).  The SSS\'s profile remained poor </p><p>under the Obasanjo regime.  Until the advent of the civilian </p><p>administration in May 1999, special paramilitary anticrime </p><p>squads called "Rapid Response Teams" operated in every state. </p><p> Under Obasanjo, the military personnel dispatched to these </p><p>units returned to their barracks, but the units remained </p><p>intact in most states, staffed by regular policemen and with </p><p>a reduced role and a less menacing presence.  The Obasanjo </p><p>Government increased its reliance on the army to quell </p><p>internal disorder.  The degree of civilian control over the </p><p>Rapid Response Teams and the national police force improved </p><p>during the course of the year.  Despite these new controls, </p><p>members of the security forces, including the police, </p><p>anticrime squads, and the armed forces committed numerous, </p><p>serious human rights abuses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The economy has declined for much of the last three decades. </p><p>Most of the population of approximately 120 million was rural </p><p>and engaged in small-scale agriculture. Agriculture accounted </p><p>for less than 40 percent of gross domestic product but </p><p>employed more than 65 percent of the work force.  The </p><p>agriculture and manufacturing sectors deteriorated </p><p>considerably during the oil boom decades.  The collapse of </p><p>market agriculture contributed significantly to the country\'s </p><p>urbanization and increased unemployment. Although the great </p><p>bulk of economic activity is outside the formal sector, </p><p>recorded gross domestic product per capita was $250.  Much of </p><p>the nation\'s wealth continued to be concentrated in the hands </p><p>of a small elite mostly through corruption and nontransparent </p><p>government contracting practices.  During the year, petroleum </p><p>accounted for over 98 percent of the country\'s export </p><p>revenues, most of the government\'s revenues, and almost all </p><p>foreign investment. During the year economic growth was </p><p>modest, with growth still impeded by inadequate </p><p>infrastructure, endemic corruption, and general economic </p><p>mismanagement.  The Obasanjo Administration inherited ports, </p><p>roads, water, and power infrastructure in a state of </p><p>collapse.  Both the Federal Government and various states </p><p>have focused on improving infrastructure with some success. </p><p>Chronic fuel shortages which afflicted the country for </p><p>several years have been alleviated.  Food production has </p><p>improved, due in part to record rainfalls, but post-harvest </p><p>loss remains a significant problem due to poor transportation </p><p>infrastructure.  An estimated two-thirds of the country\'s </p><p>population live in poverty and are subject to malnutrition </p><p>and disease.  In 2001, the Government has made progress in </p><p>reducing controls on the private sector, and increasing </p><p>expenditures for key social sectors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government\'s human rights record was mixed; although </p><p>there were improvements in several areas during the year, </p><p>serious problems remain.  While the national police, army, </p><p>and security forces continued to commit extrajudicial </p><p>killings and used excessive force to quell civil unrest and </p><p>ethnic violence, the frequency of these abuses has declined </p><p>as compared to the record under the previous military </p><p>governments.  The military was called on to restore order in </p><p>four incidents of civil unrest or conflict--Jos, Tafawa </p><p>Balewa, Kano and in the Tiv-Jukun conflict in Benue, Nasarawa </p><p>and Taraba states.  The containment of severe ethnic conflict </p><p>has been important to restoration of order in these areas, </p><p>and the military has done so without many of the excesses </p><p>seen in previous military regimes.  Nevertheless, Army, </p><p>police, and security force officers regularly beat </p><p>protesters, criminal suspects, detainees, and convicted </p><p>prisoners; however, there were no reports of torture of </p><p>political dissidents. The Government took steps to curb </p><p>torture and beating of detainees and prisoners, including the </p><p>dismissal and arrest in 2000 of senior officials known for </p><p>such practices.  Shari\'a courts sentenced persons to harsh </p><p>punishments including amputations and death by stoning.  Of </p><p>many amputation sentences, only two were carried out, and the </p><p>sentences for stoning have not been implemented.  Prison </p><p>conditions were harsh and life threatening, and along with </p><p>the lack of food and medical treatment, contributed to the </p><p>death of numerous inmates.  At different times in the year, </p><p>the Government released several hundred prisoners in an </p><p>attempt to ease prison congestion.  In May 1999, the </p><p>Government repealed the State Security (Detention of Persons) </p><p>Decree of 1984 (Decree 2), which allowed arbitrary detention </p><p>without charge; however, police and security forces continued </p><p>to use arbitrary arrest and detention.  Prolonged pretrial </p><p>detention remains a major problem. The judiciary is subject </p><p>to political influence, and is hampered by corruption and </p><p>inefficiency.  The judicial system was incapable of providing </p><p>citizens with the right to a speedy, fair trial. The </p><p>Government continued to infringe on citizens\' privacy rights; </p><p>however, there were no reports of members of the armed forces </p><p>looting property, destroying buildings, or driving persons </p><p>away from their homes.  The Government generally respected </p><p>freedom of speech and of the press; however, there were some </p><p>exceptions.  The Government continued to relax its </p><p>restrictions on the rights of freedom of association and </p><p>assembly.  The Government occasionally restricted freedom of </p><p>movement.  The Government generally respected freedom of </p><p>religion, however, the expansion of Shari\'a law in the North </p><p>raised regional and ethnic tensions and threatened religious </p><p>freedom for minority religionists.  The </p><p>Government-established Human Rights Violations Investigation </p><p>Panel (HRVIP), continued its work throughout the year </p><p>reviewing cases of human rights violations since 1966. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Domestic violence against women remained widespread and some </p><p>forms were sanctioned by traditional, customary, or Shari\'a </p><p>law.  Discrimination against women remained a problem. </p><p>Female genital mutilation (FGM) remained widely practiced, </p><p>and child abuse and child prostitution were common. </p><p>Localized discrimination and violence against religious </p><p>minorities persisted. Ethnic and regional discrimination </p><p>remained widespread and interethnic, religious, and regional </p><p>tensions increased significantly. Thousands of persons were </p><p>killed in various local ethnic and religious conflicts </p><p>throughout the country.  Some members of the Ijaw ethnic </p><p>group in the oil-producing Niger Delta region who seek </p><p>greater local autonomy continued to commit serious abuses, </p><p>including killings and kidnappings.  The police often could </p><p>not protect citizens from interethnic, interreligious, </p><p>communal, and criminal violence, and, due to the inability of </p><p>the police, the Government called upon the army to restore </p><p>order following unrest in three cities during the course of </p><p>the year.  The Government took steps to improve worker </p><p>rights; however, some restrictions continued.  Some persons, </p><p>including children, were subjected to forced labor. Child </p><p>labor continued to increase.  Trafficking in persons for </p><p>purposes of forced prostitution and forced labor was a </p><p>problem and collusion of government officials in trafficking </p><p>was alleged.  Vigilante violence increased throughout the </p><p>country, particularly in Lagos and Onitsha, where suspected </p><p>criminals were apprehended, beaten, and sometimes killed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Respect for Human Rights </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including </p><p>Freedom From </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>National police, army, and security forces committed </p><p>extrajudicial killings and used excessive force to quell </p><p>civil unrest under the Obasanjo Government, although their </p><p>record of managing civil unrest improved from last year and </p><p>was much better that under the military regimes of the past. </p><p> The Government did not use lethal force to repress </p><p>nonviolent, purely political activities; however, lethal </p><p>force was used when protests or demonstrations were perceived </p><p>as becoming violent or disruptive, or in the apprehension and </p><p>detention of suspected criminals.  There was marginal </p><p>improvement in security force accountability as misconduct </p><p>was investigated in a few instances.  However in most cases, </p><p>neither the state anticrime task forces, the police, nor the </p><p>armed forces were held accountable for excessive, deadly use </p><p>of force or the death of individuals in custody.  They </p><p>operated with impunity in the apprehension, illegal </p><p>detention, and sometimes execution of criminal suspects. </p><p>Since taking office, President Obasanjo largely resisted </p><p>pressure to call in military troops to quell domestic unrest, </p><p>which reduced the risk that the armed forces would overreact </p><p>or harass civilians.  Instead, Obasanjo preferred to let the </p><p>police deal with civil disturbances, only sending in military </p><p>reinforcements when the police were unable to restore order. </p><p>Inter-ethnic clashes in June and July in Nasarawa, Bauchi and </p><p>Taraba States were handled with a police response.  In </p><p>September the military was deployed in Plateau State to quell </p><p>a major outburst of ethno-religious violence between </p><p>Christians and Muslims.  By October army troops were </p><p>responsible for maintaining order in Kaduna, Jos, Tafawa </p><p>Balewa, Kano and a significant part of eastern Benue, eastern </p><p>Nasarawa and western Taraba states.  Nigerian military unit </p><p>commanders were briefed that international humanitarian laws </p><p>must be respected, &except when the security of troops is in </p><p>jeopardy.8  Multinational oil companies and Nigerian oil </p><p>producing companies subcontract police and soldiers from area </p><p>units particularly to protect the oil facilities in the </p><p>volatile Niger Delta region.  A significant portion of the </p><p>strong upsurge in violent crime during the year was </p><p>attributable to criminal freelancing by current or former </p><p>security forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Police and military personnel used excessive and sometimes </p><p>deadly force in the suppression of civil unrest, property </p><p>vandalization, and interethnic violence, primarily in the oil </p><p>and gas regions of the Delta States.  Confrontations between </p><p>increasingly militant "youths" (who tend to be unemployed </p><p>males between the ages of 16 and 40), oil companies, and </p><p>government authorities continued during the year.  In June </p><p>mobile police in Khana local government area fatally shot an </p><p>Ogoni man who was allegedly unarmed at the time.  In July a </p><p>police officer protecting oil contractors in Bayelsa State </p><p>killed a local youth, reportedly after he tried to disarm a </p><p>police officer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In February Police attempts to disperse Muslim protesters </p><p>outside the main mosque in Gombe resulted in violence with </p><p>protestors damaging buildings and attacking the police </p><p>barracks.  Reports of fatalities varied between three and </p><p>eight killed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On many occasions during the year the Government authorized </p><p>the use of deadly force to combat crime, and police, </p><p>military, and anticrime taskforce personnel committed </p><p>numerous extrajudicial killings in the apprehension and </p><p>detention of suspected criminals.  Police were instructed to </p><p>use deadly force against suspected vandals near oil pipelines </p><p>in the Niger Delta Region, against the Oodua Peoples Congress </p><p>(OPC) vigilante group in Lagos State and, allegedly, against </p><p>participants in the Jos and Kano riots that took place in </p><p>September and October, respectively. In a widely publicized </p><p>case, a police raid aimed at apprehending armed robbers </p><p>resulted in the death of at least four unarmed Igbo traders. </p><p>Violence and lethal force at police roadblocks and </p><p>checkpoints was reduced during the year; however, some </p><p>instances of such violence continued.  During the year an </p><p>upsurge in violent crime in Lagos led to an increase in the </p><p>number of roadblocks and checkpoints at major intersections, </p><p>without an increase in police misconduct or violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harsh and life threatening prison conditions and denial of </p><p>proper medical treatment contributed to the death of numerous </p><p>inmates (see Section 1.c.).  Criminal suspects died from </p><p>unnatural causes while in official custody, usually as the </p><p>result of neglect and harsh treatment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By the end of the year the case concerning a member of Lagos </p><p>Deputy Governor\'s security detail had yet to be transferred </p><p>to a court of competent jurisdiction.  The individual </p><p>allegedly killed a young woman in May, 2000 when she </p><p>obstructed the Deputy Governor,s motorcade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government continued to investigate and detain former </p><p>Abacha government officials and family members.  The Lagos </p><p>High Court prosecution of Hamza al-Mustapha, Mohammed Abacha, </p><p>Mohammed Rabo Lawal, Lateef Shofalan, Mohammed Aminu and </p><p>Sergeant Rogers Mshiella for the 1996 murder of Kudirat </p><p>Abiola, a prominent prodemocracy activist and the wife of </p><p>Moshood Abiola, was adjourned pending a ruling from the </p><p>Supreme Court on an application by defense lawyers.  Colonel </p><p>Ibrahim Yakassai, was being held for alleged involvement in </p><p>the death of Shehu Musa Yar,Adua, a case which has not yet </p><p>been formally been brought before a court.  In addition to </p><p>the above Hamza Al Mustapha, Muhammed Rabo Lawal, Lateef </p><p>Shofolahan, Mohammed Aminu, Col. Yakubu, Ishaya Bamaiyi, </p><p>James Danbaba and Rogers Mshiella were in detention, charged </p><p>with the attempted murder in 1996 of Guardian newspaper </p><p>publisher Alex Ibru.  The Ibru case was postponed when </p><p>Bamaiyi and Mustapha were summoned to appear before the Human </p><p>Rights Violations Investigation Panel (HRVIP). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On August 19 Rivers State House of Assemblyman Monday Ndor </p><p>was shot and killed by unknown actors outside his residence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On October 4, violent clashes between the APP and the PDP in </p><p>Gusau, Zamfara State left four dead and 19 critically </p><p>injured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the year, lethal interethnic and intra-ethnic violence </p><p>escalated.  In September, rioting broke out between the </p><p>Muslim Hausa and various predominantly Christian ethnic </p><p>groups in to Plateau State. Explanations for the initial </p><p>cause of the riot vary.  Approximately 2,300 people may have </p><p>lost their lives in the disturbances, with many of the </p><p>victims buried in mass graves.  Religious and ethnic violence </p><p>resulted in deaths in other communities as well.  In June, </p><p>ethnic clashes in Nassarawa State between Tivs, Jukuns, </p><p>Hausa-speakers and Kwala led to several hundred deaths and </p><p>the displacement of approximately 40,000 people into </p><p>neighboring Benue State.  This conflict resulted in the </p><p>kidnapping and murder of 23 army soldiers who were patrolling </p><p>the area to enforce the peace between the ethnic groups.  In </p><p>Taraba State a dispute between Fulani herders and Tiv farmers </p><p>reportedly resulted in eight deaths.  Hours after a peaceful </p><p>demonstration against U.S. military action in Afghanistan, </p><p>rioting broke out on 12 October in Kano, resulting in over </p><p>100 dead and significant property damage </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The scale of communal violence in the Niger Delta area </p><p>lessened but ethnic rivalries and disputes between local </p><p>communities over resources still led to deadly clashes.  In </p><p>July, serious fighting took place between the Akaeze and Osso </p><p>Edda communities in Ebonyi State.  Reports indicated that 27 </p><p>people had been killed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the Kalabari region of Rivers State, fighting between </p><p>three Ijaw communities: the Ke, Bille and Krakrama, led to </p><p>the reports of the deaths of between 20 and 100 people. </p><p>Violent border disputes between Cross River and Akwa Ibom </p><p>states continued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Organized vigilante groups in large cities, particularly </p><p>Lagos and Onitsha, committed numerous killings of suspected </p><p>criminals.  These vigilante groups engage in lengthy and </p><p>well-organized attempts to apprehend criminals after the </p><p>commission of the alleged offenses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Anambra State, the state government supported the </p><p>extrajudicial activities of the vigilante group known as the </p><p>Bakassi Boys.  Like most vigilante groups, the Bakassi Boys </p><p>kill suspected criminals rather than turn them over to </p><p>police.  The Bakassi Boys tortured and then executed between </p><p>25 and 36 suspected criminals at main intersections in </p><p>Onitsha on May 29th. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Lagos State, the vigilante group known as the OPC clashed </p><p>repeatedly with the police over their protection of Yoruba </p><p>neighborhoods and over political issues.  The organization </p><p>continued to function as a vigilante anti-crime force despite </p><p>the continuing operation of a &shoot-on-sight8 order issued </p><p>against them by President Obasanjo in November of 1999.  The </p><p>number of vigilante killings of suspected criminals carried </p><p>out by OPC was less than in recent years.  Among the more </p><p>prominent incidents, in August, the OPC reportedly beheaded </p><p>four suspected robbers in Lagos before burning the bodies. </p><p>The crucifixion of a man in the Surelere district of Lagos </p><p>was also attributed to the OPC by the local community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were occasional killings in several universities </p><p>carried out by rival student organizations, commonly referred </p><p>to as &cults8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Extrajudicial killing carried out by organized gangs of armed </p><p>robbers remained commonplace throughout the year.  Multiple </p><p>sources reported that a gang of at least 30 armed robbers </p><p>killed 22 residents of the town of Awkuzu, allegedly as </p><p>revenge for Bakassi Boy executions of suspected criminals </p><p>earlier in the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There also were numerous reports of street mobs apprehending </p><p>and killing suspected criminals. The practice of "necklacing" </p><p>criminals (placing a gasoline-soaked tire around a victim\'s </p><p>neck or torso and then igniting it, burning the victim to </p><p>death) caught in the act occurred in several cities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b. Disappearance </p><p>There were no reports of politically motivated </p><p>disappearances.  Members of minority ethnic groups in the </p><p>oil-producing areas kidnapped foreign and local oil company </p><p>employees to press their demands for more redistribution of </p><p>wealth generated by joint ventures with the state-controlled </p><p>petroleum corporation and for specific projects in their </p><p>areas.  In all instances the victims were released unharmed </p><p>after negotiations between the captors and the oil firms; the </p><p>firms usually paid ransoms and promised improved conditions. </p><p>In addition to the political rationale for kidnapping, there </p><p>were numerous instances of strictly criminal kidnapping, in </p><p>which the perpetrators\' sole objective was ransom for the </p><p>release of the victims.  During the year, kidnappings by </p><p>criminals to extort money were more numerous than those </p><p>perpetrated for " political" reasons.  There were also </p><p>several reports of different ethnic groups in the Delta </p><p>kidnapping rivals of other ethnicities as part of ongoing </p><p>disputes over resources.  Due to limited manpower and </p><p>resources, the police and armed forces rarely were able to </p><p>confront the perpetrators of these acts, especially in the </p><p>volatile Delta region.  A lack of resources prevented </p><p>judicial investigations from taking place so that kidnappings </p><p>were routinely left uninvestigated. </p><p>c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment </p><p>or Punishment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits torture and mistreatment of </p><p>prisoners, and the law provides for punishment for such </p><p>abuses; however, although there were no reports of torture of </p><p>political dissidents during the year, army, police, and </p><p>security force officers regularly beat protesters, criminal </p><p>suspects, detainees, and convicted prisoners.  Police </p><p>regularly physically mistreated civilians in attempts to </p><p>extort money from them. Detainees often were kept </p><p>incommunicado for long periods of time.  The 1960 Evidence </p><p>Act prohibits the introduction into trials of evidence </p><p>obtained through torture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With different versions of criminal Shari\'a law now in place </p><p>in 12 Northern states, Shari\'a courts delivered "hadd" </p><p>sentences such as amputation for theft, caning for various </p><p>offenses, and death by stoning.  The courts have yet to </p><p>decide whether such punishments conflict with the </p><p>constitutional provision banning "torture or... inhuman or </p><p>degrading treatment."  Caning, a punishment available under </p><p>Nigerian common law, the Northern Nigerian Penal Code, and </p><p>Shari\'a law, does not appear to conflict with the </p><p>Constitution and has not been successfully challenged in the </p><p>court system as a violation of the constitutional provision </p><p>banning "torture or... inhuman or degrading treatment." </p><p>Stoning and amputation also have not been challenged under </p><p>the 1999 Constitution.  There were only two amputations </p><p>carried out in 2001, despite a much larger number of </p><p>sentences. Lawal Isa had his right hand amputated in Zamfara </p><p>on May 3 for stealing 3 bicycles.   Umaru Aliyu suffered the </p><p>same punishment in Sokoto on July 6, for stealing a goat. </p><p>Bariya Ibrahim Magazu, a 17-year old girl, was given 100 cane </p><p>strokes, following her conviction of fornication and slander. </p><p> Baobab, a Nigerian human rights NGO, had filed an appeal on </p><p>her behalf prior to the execution of the sentence.  The case </p><p>generated a great deal of attention among international human </p><p>rights organizations, and the execution of a reduced </p><p>sentence, underscored likely political intervention to </p><p>dispose of the case. In 2001 Shari\'a courts handed down the </p><p>first death sentences.  Attahiru Umar was sentenced to death </p><p>by stoning for sodomy by a Kebbi Shari\'a court.  In Sokoto, </p><p>Safiya Hussaini, was convicted of adultery because she could </p><p>not prove who was responsible for her pregnancy.  The Federal </p><p>Government has instituted a panel of legal scholars to draft </p><p>a uniform Shari\'a criminal statute for all Northern states, </p><p>to replace hastily drafted, unconstitutional and often </p><p>self-contradictory Shari\'a statutes adopted by the states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the numerous ethnic clashes that occurred throughout the </p><p>year, hundreds of persons were beaten and injured severely. </p><p>Police and security forces failed to respond to most criminal </p><p>acts in a timely manner.  During a year that saw a </p><p>significant increase in criminal activity and civil unrest in </p><p>Lagos, Kano and elsewhere, police generally were outgunned </p><p>and outmaneuvered by criminals, or overwhelmed by mobs trying </p><p>to foment civil unrest.  (See sections 1.a and 1.b). </p><p>Security forces occasionally beat and/or detained journalists </p><p>(see Section 2.a.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prison and detention conditions remained harsh and life </p><p>threatening.  Most prisons were built 70 to 80 years ago and </p><p>lack functioning basic facilities. Lack of potable water, </p><p>inadequate sewage facilities, and severe overcrowding </p><p>resulted in unhealthy and dangerous sanitary conditions. Many </p><p>prisons held 200 to 300 percent more persons than they were </p><p>designed to hold, and many of the pretrial detainees held </p><p>without charge had been detained for periods far longer than </p><p>the maximum allowable sentence for the crimes for which they </p><p>were being held.  Disease was pervasive in the cramped, </p><p>poorly ventilated facilities, and chronic shortages of </p><p>medical supplies were reported.  Prison inmates were allowed </p><p>outside their cells for recreation or exercise only </p><p>irregularly and many inmates had to provide their own food. </p><p>Only those with money or whose relatives brought food </p><p>regularly had sufficient food; petty corruption among prison </p><p>officials made it difficult for money provided for food to </p><p>reach prisoners.  Poor inmates often relied on handouts from </p><p>others to survive.  Beds or mattresses were not provided to </p><p>many inmates, forcing them to sleep on concrete floors, often </p><p>without a blanket.  Prison officials, police, and security </p><p>forces often denied inmates food and medical treatment as a </p><p>form of punishment or to extort money from them.  Harsh </p><p>conditions and denial of proper medical treatment contributed </p><p>to the deaths in detention of numerous prisoners.  A </p><p>reputable human rights organization estimated in 1999 that at </p><p>least one inmate died per day in the Kiri Kiri prison in </p><p>Lagos alone.  According to Prisoners Rehabilitation and </p><p>Welfare Action (PRAWA) a nongovernmental organization (NGO), </p><p>dead inmates promptly are buried on the prison compounds, </p><p>usually without their families having been notified.  A </p><p>nationwide estimate of the number of inmates who die daily in </p><p>the country\'s prisons is difficult to obtain because of </p><p>record keeping by prison officials. PRAWA alleged that prison </p><p>conditions were worse in rural areas than in urban districts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRAWA and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) </p><p>have regular access to the prisons and publish newsletters on </p><p>their work.  The Government admits that there are problems </p><p>with its incarceration and rehabilitation programs and worked </p><p>with groups such as these to address those problems. </p><p>d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention; </p><p>however, the Government rarely observed these prohibitions </p><p>and the police and security forces continued to use arbitrary </p><p>arrest and detention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Police and security forces were empowered to make arrests </p><p>without warrants if they believed that there was reason to </p><p>suspect that a person had committed an offense; they often </p><p>abused this power.  Under the Fundamental Rights Enforcement </p><p>Procedures Rules of the Constitution (based on those of the </p><p>1979 Constitution), police may arrest and detain persons for </p><p>24 hours before charging them with an offense.  The law </p><p>requires an arresting officer to inform the accused of </p><p>charges at the time of arrest and to take the accused persons </p><p>to a station for processing within a reasonable amount of </p><p>time.  By law police must provide suspects with the </p><p>opportunity to engage counsel and post bail.  However, police </p><p>generally did not adhere to legally mandated procedures. </p><p>Suspects routinely were detained without being informed of </p><p>the charges, denied access to counsel and family members, and </p><p>denied the opportunity to post bail for bailable offenses. </p><p>Sheik Yakubu Musa, a Katsina-based Islamic scholar, was </p><p>arrested and detained by security agents for 27 days without </p><p>being charged until he was ordered released by the Abuja High </p><p>Court.  There was no functioning system of bail, so many </p><p>suspects were held in investigative detention.  If family </p><p>members attend court proceedings, an additional payment is </p><p>often demanded by police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lengthy pretrial detention remained a serious problem. </p><p>According to the Constitution, persons charged with offenses </p><p>have the right to an expeditious trial; however, in practice </p><p>this right was not respected (see Section 1.c.).  Serious </p><p>backlogs, endemic corruption, and undue political influence </p><p>continued to hamper the judicial system (see Section 1.e.). </p><p>In January the Minister of State for Internal Affairs was </p><p>quoted in the press as saying there were 45,000 inmates of </p><p>the Nigerian prison system, seventy-five percent of whom were </p><p>awaiting trial. Police cited their inability to securely </p><p>transport detainees to trial on their scheduled trial dates </p><p>as one reason why so many of the detainees were denied a </p><p>trial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Persons who happen to be in the vicinity of a crime when it </p><p>is committed normally are held for interrogation for periods </p><p>ranging from a few hours to several months.  After their </p><p>release, those detained frequently are asked to return </p><p>repeatedly for further questioning.  Police continued the </p><p>practice of placing relatives and friends of wanted suspects </p><p>in detention without criminal charge to induce suspects to </p><p>surrender to arrest, although this was done much less often </p><p>than under the Abacha regime (see Section 1.f.).  Security </p><p>forces occasionally beat and detained journalists (see </p><p>Section 2.a.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Many students have been detained for allegedly taking part in </p><p>cult or criminal activities on university campuses. </p><p>The 1999 Constitution prohibits the expulsion of citizens, </p><p>and the Government does not use forced exile. </p><p>e. Denial of Fair Public Trial </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary; </p><p>however, in practice, the judiciary remained subject to </p><p>executive and legislative branch pressure, was influenced by </p><p>political leaders at both the state and federal levels, and </p><p>suffered from corruption and inefficiency.  Understaffing, </p><p>underfunding, inefficiency, and corruption continued to </p><p>prevent the judiciary from functioning adequately.  Citizens </p><p>encountered long delays and frequent requests from judicial </p><p>officials for small bribes. </p><p>Under the Constitution, the regular court system is composed </p><p>of federal and state trial courts, state appeals courts, the </p><p>Federal Court of Appeal, and the Federal Supreme Court. </p><p>There also are Shari\'a (Islamic) and customary (traditional) </p><p>courts of appeal for each state and for the federal capital </p><p>territory (Abuja).  Courts of the first instance include </p><p>magistrate or district courts, customary or traditional </p><p>courts, Shari\'a courts, and for some specified cases, the </p><p>state high courts.  The nature of the case usually determines </p><p>which court has jurisdiction.  In principle customary and </p><p>Shari\'a courts have jurisdiction only if both plaintiff and </p><p>defendant agree.  However, in practice fear of legal costs, </p><p>delays, and distance to alternative venues encouraged many </p><p>litigants to choose the customary and Shari\'a courts over the </p><p>regular venues.  Shari\'a courts have begun to function in </p><p>thirteen northern states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Criminal justice procedures call for trial within 3 months of </p><p>arraignment for most categories of crimes.  Understaffing of </p><p>the judiciary, inefficient administrative procedures, petty </p><p>extortion, bureaucratic inertia, poor communication between </p><p>police and prison officials, and inadequate transportation </p><p>continued to result in considerable delays, often stretching </p><p>to several years, in bringing suspects to trial (see Section </p><p>1.d.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trials in the regular court system are public and generally </p><p>respect constitutionally protected individual rights, </p><p>including a presumption of innocence, the right to be </p><p>present, to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to </p><p>be represented by legal counsel.  However, there is a </p><p>widespread perception that judges easily are bribed or </p><p>"settled," and that litigants cannot rely on the courts to </p><p>render impartial judgements.  Most prisoners are poor and </p><p>cannot afford to pay the costs associated with moving their </p><p>trials forward, and as a result they remain in prison. </p><p>Wealthier defendants employ numerous delaying tactics and in </p><p>many cases used financial inducements to persuade judges to </p><p>grant numerous continuances.  This, and similar practices, </p><p>clogged the court calendar and prevented trials from </p><p>starting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Some courts are understaffed.  Judges frequently fail to </p><p>appear for trials, often because they are pursuing other </p><p>means of income.  In addition court officials often lack the </p><p>proper equipment, training, and motivation to perform their </p><p>duties, again due in no small part to their inadequate </p><p>compensation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no legal provisions barring women or other groups </p><p>from testifying in civil court or giving their testimony less </p><p>weight; however, the testimony of women and non-Muslims is </p><p>usually accorded less weight in Shari\'a courts (see Section </p><p>5). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of political prisoners. </p><p>f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or </p><p>Correspondence </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with </p><p>privacy, family, home, or correspondence; however, although </p><p>government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, </p><p>authorities continued at times to infringe on these rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Police and security forces continued the practice of placing </p><p>relatives and friends of wanted suspects in detention without </p><p>criminal charge to induce suspects to surrender to arrest, </p><p>although this was done much less frequently than under </p><p>previous military regimes. There were calls by human rights </p><p>groups for the police to end the practice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unlike in several previous years, there were no reports of </p><p>members of the armed forces looting property, destroying </p><p>buildings, and driving persons away from their homes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including: </p><p>Freedom of Speech and Press </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There is a large and vibrant private domestic press that is </p><p>frequently critical of the Government as well as Government </p><p>-owned and controlled publications. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On May 26, 1999, in the last days of Abubakar regime, Decree </p><p>60 was signed into law and created the Nigerian Press Council </p><p>which was charged with the enforcement of professional ethics </p><p>and the sanctioning of journalists who violated these ethics. </p><p> The Nigerian Press Council immediately criticized it as "an </p><p>undisguised instrument of censorship and an unacceptable </p><p>interference with the freedom of the press."  Decree 60 </p><p>attempted to put control of the practice of journalism into </p><p>the hands of a body of journalists who were appointed by and </p><p>received payment from the Government.  In 1999 the NUJ, the </p><p>professional association of all Nigerian journalists, and the </p><p>Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN) rejected </p><p>the creation of the Press Council.  The NPAN called the </p><p>decree unconstitutional and a violation of press freedom, </p><p>because there were already enough laws concerning the </p><p>operation of the press.  The decree, which virtually made </p><p>members of the council employees of the Government, also </p><p>contained a number of provisions inimical to the operation of </p><p>a free press.  Among other provisions, Decree 60 gave the </p><p>Press Council the power to accredit and register journalists </p><p>and the power to suspend journalists from practicing.  Decree </p><p>60 required publications be registered by the council </p><p>annually through a system entitled "Documentation of </p><p>Newspapers."  In applying for registration, publishers were </p><p>expected to submit their mission statements and objectives </p><p>and could be denied registration if their objectives failed </p><p>to satisfy the Council.  The penalties for practicing without </p><p>meeting the Council\'s standards were a fine of $2,200 </p><p>(250,000 Naira) or imprisonment for a term not to exceed 3 </p><p>years.  The decree also empowered the Council to approve a </p><p>code of professional and ethical conduct to guide the press </p><p>and to ensure compliance by journalists.  Under the decree, </p><p>publishers were expected to send a report of the performance </p><p>of their publications to the Council; failure to do so was an </p><p>offense that carried a fine of $900 (100,000 Naira).  The </p><p>Council has set up office and hired staff in Abuja, but is </p><p>yet to taken any official action.  Many journalists believe </p><p>that the existence of the decree and council create a </p><p>significant limitation on freedom of the press in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the year there were a few cases of threats against and </p><p>attacks on the press.  In June, Nnamdi Onyeuma, editor of a </p><p>weekly magazine Glamour Trends was arrested and detained for </p><p>libel in connection with a story alleging that President </p><p>Obasanjo received a $1 million allowance for each of his many </p><p>foreign trips.  Onyeuma is on bail awaiting court action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In May, Imo State security personnel raided newsstands where </p><p>they seized and burned publications that carried stories on </p><p>activities of the Movement for the Actualization of the </p><p>Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), an Igbo youth group </p><p>advocating the revival of the break away Biafran Republic </p><p>that was defeated in the Nigerian Civil War of 1967-70. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In April, Police beat a photographer and destroyed the film </p><p>in his camera when he attempted to photograph a suspect </p><p>leaving the Lagos High Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), the body </p><p>responsible for the regulation and monitoring of broadcast </p><p>media, threatened to take private television and radio </p><p>stations off the air in a dispute concerning the regulatory </p><p>body,s demand that the private stations pay 2.5 per cent of </p><p>their gross income to the NBC.  The Independent Broadcasters </p><p>Association of Nigeria (IBAN) challenged the fees in court </p><p>and in October, President Obasanjo interceded, setting the </p><p>annual fee for the broadcasters at Naira 150,000 or U.S. </p><p>$1,300.  During the course of the year, the NBC also </p><p>prevented the commissioning of the Here and There television </p><p>station in Oyo State claiming the original license had </p><p>expired.  The NBC is challenging expansion plans by African </p><p>Independent Television (AIT), a part of Daar Communications, </p><p>claiming that AIT,s global and terrestrial licenses do not </p><p>allow them to act as a network. This year the NBC again </p><p>issued no new private radio or television licenses.  Ten </p><p>applications pending from 1999 are still awaiting NBC </p><p>approval. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State Governors from Kano, Imo, and Zamfara States became </p><p>embroiled in disputes with journalists and publicly </p><p>threatened the media.   A journalist temporarily lost his </p><p>accreditation to cover the State House in Imo State because </p><p>of an article critical of the Governor,s wife. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are two national, government-owned daily newspapers in </p><p>English, the New Nigerian and the Daily Times. The New </p><p>Nigerian publishes an additional Hausa edition.  Several </p><p>states own daily or weekly newspapers that also are published </p><p>in English.  They tend to be poorly produced, have limited </p><p>circulation, and require large state subsidies to continue </p><p>operating.  Several private newspapers and magazines have </p><p>begun publication since the inauguration of the civilian </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Because newspapers and television are relatively expensive </p><p>and literacy levels are low, radio remains the most important </p><p>medium of mass communication and information. There is a </p><p>national radio broadcaster, the Federal Radio Corporation of </p><p>Nigeria, which broadcasts in English, Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, </p><p>and other languages.  Fifty-one state radio stations </p><p>broadcast in English and local languages. For many years, the </p><p>Government prohibited nationwide private radio broadcasting, </p><p>but the Abacha regime granted broadcasting rights to local </p><p>and regional private radio stations in 1994.  There were six </p><p>private radio stations operating at the beginning of the </p><p>year.  International broadcasters, principally the Voice of </p><p>America (VOA) and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), as </p><p>well as Deutsche Welle and others, broadcast in English and </p><p>Hausa and represent an important source of news for </p><p>Nigerians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Television Station, NTA, is federally owned, </p><p>while 30 states also operate television stations.  There are </p><p>nine privately owned television stations that broadcast </p><p>domestic news and political commentary.  There are two </p><p>private satellite television services.  The 1993 Press Law </p><p>requires local television stations to limit programming from </p><p>other countries to 40 percent.  The 1993 Press Law also </p><p>restricts the foreign content of satellite broadcasting to 20 </p><p>percent, but the Government does not restrict access to, or </p><p>reception of, international cable or satellite television. </p><p>The Government did not restrict Internet access, although </p><p>unreliable and costly telephone service limited access and </p><p>hindered service providers.  NITEL, the Nigerian PTT, </p><p>competed with dozens of privately owned Internet service </p><p>providers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While private television and radio broadcasters remained </p><p>economically viable on advertising revenues alone, despite </p><p>the restrictions that the Government imposed on them, </p><p>government-sponsored broadcasters complained that government </p><p>funding and advertising were inadequate for their needs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Even though editors report that government security officers </p><p>sometimes visit or call to demand information about a story </p><p>or source, journalists and editors no longer fear suspension </p><p>or imprisonment for their editorial decisions.  State </p><p>broadcasters and journalists remain important tools for </p><p>civilian governors; these officials use the state-owned media </p><p>to showcase the state\'s accomplishments and to promote their </p><p>own political fortunes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since the May 1999 elections, foreign journalists who sought </p><p>to enter the country to cover political developments </p><p>generally have been able to obtain visas, and many of the </p><p>obstacles that previously frustrated foreign journalists were </p><p>removed.  Officials within the Ministry of Information became </p><p>more accommodating to requests from foreign journalists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under Obasanjo\'s government, concrete steps have been taken </p><p>to address the problems in the education sector and to </p><p>restore academic freedom.  In 1999, Obasanjo approved the </p><p>establishment of four new private universities.  Student </p><p>groups alleged that numerous strikes, inadequate facilities, </p><p>and the rise of cultism (or gangs) on campuses continue to </p><p>hamper educational progress.  On several occasions during the </p><p>year, protests by students resulted in harassment and arrest </p><p>by police forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Twenty-five wounded soldiers were sentenced to life </p><p>imprisonment for "mutiny" and "disobedience" by a court </p><p>martial after publicly protesting their treatment by military </p><p>officials.  The soldiers had alleged medical neglect, </p><p>substandard treatment and non-payment of allowances after </p><p>they returned wounded from serving in the Nigerian contingent </p><p>of ECOMOG forces in Liberia and Sierra Leone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 1999 Constitution provides citizens with the right to </p><p>assemble freely; and the Government generally respected this </p><p>right, although some limits remained. </p><p>Throughout the year, the Government nominally required </p><p>organizers of outdoor public functions to apply for permits, </p><p>although both government authorities and those assembling </p><p>often ignored this requirement.  The Government retained </p><p>legal provisions banning gatherings whose political, ethnic, </p><p>or religious content might lead to unrest.  Open-air </p><p>religious services away from places of worship remained </p><p>prohibited in most states due to religious tensions in </p><p>various parts of the country.  For example, various Northern </p><p>states, including Plateau, Kano, Zamfara and Kaduna </p><p>instituted bans on public gatherings immediately following </p><p>periods of violent unrest.  This was done in consultation </p><p>with a number of religious and traditional groups, and local </p><p>governments in order to prevent a recurrence of unrest. </p><p>Kaduna state government extended its ban on processions, </p><p>rallies, demonstrations, and meetings in public places in </p><p>order to prevent repetition of the violence that followed the </p><p>establishment of Shari\'a law (see Sections 1.a. and 2.c.).  A </p><p>political rally in Zamfara State degenerated into violence in </p><p>September, prompting a temporary ban on public political </p><p>rallies.  Because of heightened inter-ethnic, inter-religious </p><p>and purely political tensions in 2001, various state </p><p>governments balance requests for public gatherings with their </p><p>potential for creating unrest, and generally permit them to </p><p>go forward when possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Generally, the police do not break up or cancel scheduled </p><p>meetings unless there is a compelling security reason. </p><p>Following the APP/PDP riot in Gusau, a PDP rally for the </p><p>Northwest Zone, scheduled to take place in Sokoto October </p><p>4-5, was cancelled by police for security reasons.  A group </p><p>known as the Fourth Dimension, led by former Vice President </p><p>Augustus Aikhomu, was prevented from meeting in July because </p><p>of violence that occurred at a prior meeting in Benin City. </p><p>Police also cancelled a planned meeting of southern governors </p><p>in Enugu, called to counter a meeting of the 19 northern </p><p>governors, because it was "capable of creating disharmony." </p><p>Police regularly disrupt meetings of the OPC, and maintain a </p><p>ban on the organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Freedom of Religion </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, including </p><p>freedom to change one\'s religion or belief, and freedom to </p><p>manifest and propagate one\'s religion or belief in worship, </p><p>teaching, practice, and observance; however, the Government </p><p>restricted these rights in practice in certain respects. </p><p>Respect for religious freedom remained limited during the </p><p>year due to the implementation of an expanded version of </p><p>Shari\'a law in a total of 13 northern states, which </p><p>challenged constitutional protections for religious freedom </p><p>and occasionally sparked interreligious violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Nigerian Constitution prohibits state and local </p><p>governments from adopting an official religion.  The </p><p>Constitution also provides that states may elect to use </p><p>Islamic (Shari\'a) customary law and courts.  Federal, state </p><p>and local governments fund various religious activities, </p><p>including pilgrimages to Mecca for Muslims and Jerusalem for </p><p>Christians, as well as requiring Christian or Islamic </p><p>religious knowledge to be taught in public schools. About </p><p>half of the population is Muslim, about 40 percent Christian, </p><p>and about 10 percent practice traditional indigenous religion </p><p>or no religion. Since independence, the jurisdiction of </p><p>Shari\'a courts has been limited to family or personal law </p><p>cases involving Muslims, or to civil disputes between Muslims </p><p>and non-Muslims who consent to the courts\' jurisdiction. </p><p>However, the Constitution states that a Shari\'a court of </p><p>appeal may exercise "such other jurisdiction as may be </p><p>conferred upon it by the law of the State."  Some states have </p><p>interpreted this language as granting them the right to </p><p>expand the jurisdiction of existing Shari\'a courts to include </p><p>criminal matters.  Several Christians have alleged that, with </p><p>the adoption of an expanded Shari\'a law in several states and </p><p>the continued use of state funds to fund the construction of </p><p>mosques, teaching of Alkalis (Muslim judges), and pilgrimages </p><p>to Mecca (Hajj), Islam has been adopted as the de facto state </p><p>religion of several northern states.  However, state funds </p><p>also are used to fund Christian pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In </p><p>general states with a clear Christian or Muslim majority </p><p>tailor state-funded services to favor the majority faith. </p><p>The Constitution also provides that the Federal Government is </p><p>to establish a Federal Shari\'a Court of Appeal and Final </p><p>Court of Appeal; however, the Government had not yet </p><p>established such courts by year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government continued to enforce a ban on the existence of </p><p>religious organizations on campuses of primary schools, </p><p>although individual students retain the right to practice </p><p>their religion in recognized places of worship.  Many states </p><p>allow the teaching of Kuranic or Biblical knowledge in </p><p>primary and secondary schools; however, in almost all states </p><p>with religious minorities, there are reports that students </p><p>are forced to take classes that violate their religious </p><p>principles.  Islamic religious knowledge (IRK) is a mandatory </p><p>part of the curriculum in public schools in the North, while </p><p>Christian religious knowledge (CRK) is mandatory in the </p><p>South.  State authorities claim that students are permitted </p><p>to decline to attend these classes or to request a teacher of </p><p>their own religion to provide alternative instruction.  In </p><p>practice, where the population of a state is evenly divided, </p><p>CRK and IRK are equally available.  Where there is a </p><p>predominant faith, the minority faith may or may not be </p><p>offered in the schools.  For example, in many southern states </p><p>CRK is taught in the schools and IRK is not offered to Muslim </p><p>students in the public schools.  Conversely, the opposite is </p><p>true in northern states with an overwhelming Muslim majority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits religious discrimination; however, reports </p><p>were common that government officials discriminated against </p><p>persons practicing a religion different from their own, </p><p>notably in hiring or awarding contracts. Christians in the </p><p>northern, predominantly Muslim part of the country accused </p><p>local government officials of attempting to use zoning </p><p>regulations to stop or slow the establishment of non-Muslim, </p><p>usually Christian, churches.  Muslims in parts of the South </p><p>have suffered similar discrimination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Purdah continued in parts of the country leading to continued </p><p>restrictions on the freedom of movement of women (see Section </p><p>5). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In October 1999, the governor of Zamfara state signed into </p><p>law two bills aimed at instituting Islamic Shari\'a law in his </p><p>state.  Implementation of the law began on January 22. </p><p>Zamfara\'s law adopted traditional Shari\'a in its entirety, </p><p>with the exception that apostasy was not criminalized. </p><p>Following Zamfara\'s lead, other northern states began to </p><p>implement varying forms of expanded Shari\'a; by year\'s end 13 </p><p>states had adopted variations of Shari\'a law: Sokoto, Niger, </p><p>Kano, Kebbi, Jigawa, Yobe, Zamfara, Katsina, Borno, Bauchi, </p><p>Gombe and Kaduna states.  Previously, Shari\'a law had been </p><p>practiced in the north in the areas of personal law, only if </p><p>both litigants agreed to settle their disputes in Shari\'a </p><p>courts. Elements of Shari\'a also had been present in the </p><p>northern penal code, which had been applicable in the north </p><p>since independence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As the result of ethnic and religious violence attendant to </p><p>the expansion of Shari\'a criminal law in various Northern and </p><p>Middle-Belt states, (see Section 5), several northern state </p><p>governments banned open air preaching and public religious </p><p>processions. (#) Katsina and Plateau state governments have </p><p>enacted and maintained a ban on public proselytizing for </p><p>security reasons.  Kaduna has maintained a ban on all forms </p><p>of "processions, rallies, demonstrations, and meetings in </p><p>public places."  Such bans were viewed as necessary public </p><p>safety measures after the deaths of thousands in </p><p>predominantly ethno-religious conflicts, sparked in part by </p><p>the expansion of Shari\'a since 2000, in Kaduna, Plateau, </p><p>Kano, Gombe and Bauchi.  However, large outdoor religious </p><p>gatherings continued to be quite common, especially in the </p><p>southern part of the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Government has tacitly acknowledged the ability </p><p>of states to implement criminal Shari\'a.  However, the </p><p>Federal Government has instituted a committee charged with </p><p>the responsibility to draft uniform Shari\'a criminal and </p><p>procedural laws that could be adopted by all states, instead </p><p>of the current state-drafted statutes that differ in many </p><p>respects (see Section 1.c.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although the expanded Shari\'a laws technically do not apply </p><p>to Christians, the Christian minority in some states has been </p><p>subjected to many of the social provisions of the law, </p><p>primarily the ban on the sale of alcohol.  Consumption of </p><p>alcohol by Christians has not been criminalized, however, its </p><p>sale and public consumption have been restricted throughout </p><p>most of the North, except on Federal Government installations </p><p>such as military and police barracks.  All Muslims were </p><p>subjected to the new Shari\'a provisions in the states that </p><p>enacted them.  Various human rights groups have challenged </p><p>the constitutionality of criminal Shari\'a, but these suits </p><p>have failed for lack of a plaintiff with adequate legal </p><p>standing.  Safiya Hussaini, a divorcee who was convicted of </p><p>adultery and sentenced to death by stoning, has indicated her </p><p>intention to appeal, challenging the constitutionality of the </p><p>conviction (see Section 1.c.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Distribution of religious publications remained generally </p><p>unrestricted, however, the Government continued to enforce </p><p>lightly a ban on published religious advertisements.  There </p><p>were reports by Christians in Zamfara State that the state </p><p>government restricted the distribution of Christian religious </p><p>literature.  Many Christians in the North complain that they </p><p>are not provided adequate radio time on state-owned radio </p><p>stations while Islamic religious programs are aired without </p><p>charge.  Six Pakistani Muslim scholars were arrested in Benue </p><p>State September 23 without being charged, and were later </p><p>questioned by Federal Government officials in Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Following violence in relation to the expansion of Shari\'a </p><p>laws in Kaduna in February 2000, several northern state </p><p>governments banned any type of proselytizing, in spite of the </p><p>fact that it is permitted by the Constitution.  With </p><p>Shari\'a-attendant violence recurring in Plateau, Bauchi and </p><p>Gombe states, such bans have remained in place.  In Jos, </p><p>Missionaries reported that law enforcement officials harassed </p><p>them when they proselytized outside of majority Christian </p><p>neighborhoods.  Proselytizing did not appear to be restricted </p><p>in the southern part of the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Government continued to settle property claims by </p><p>Muslim Brotherhood leader Ibrahim El-Zakzaky for compensation </p><p>for his home and mosque, which were razed by law enforcement </p><p>in 1997.  All 96 of the Muslim Brotherhood followers jailed </p><p>under the previous regime were released during the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, </p><p>Emigration, and Repatriation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution entitles citizens to move freely throughout </p><p>the country and reside where they wish, and in general, the </p><p>Government respected this right; however, police occasionally </p><p>restricted this right by enforcing curfews in areas struck by </p><p>civil unrest, setting up roadblocks and checkpoints.  These </p><p>are routinely used by law enforcement agencies to search for </p><p>criminals, and to prevent the transport of bodies from areas </p><p>of conflict to other parts of the country where their </p><p>presence might instigate retaliatory violence. </p><p>Unfortunately, security and law enforcement officials often </p><p>used such checkpoints to engage in extortion and occasional </p><p>violence (see Sections 1.a. and 1.c.).  Unlike last year, </p><p>there were no reports of government officials restricting </p><p>mass movements of individuals fleeing ethnic unrest.  In </p><p>March 2000, however, the Governor of Niger State instructed </p><p>state police to install roadblocks to prevent southerners </p><p>from returning to their homes.  In that incident, </p><p>southerners, particularly Igbo traders, were attempting to </p><p>return home because they feared violent reprisals in response </p><p>to the deaths of Hausas in Aba and Owerri (see Section 1.a.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Violent clashes between ethnic Hausa and various non-Muslim </p><p>ethnic groups in Jos, Tafawa Balewa, and Kano resulted in the </p><p>imposition of dusk-to-dawn curfew following the deaths of as </p><p>many as 50 persons (see Sections 1.a. and 5).  In September </p><p>and October, Tiv youths set up roadblocks in eastern Benue to </p><p>harass and kill ethnic Jukuns (see Section 1.a.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution also prohibits the denial of exit or entry </p><p>to any citizen, and the Government generally respected this </p><p>law; however, the law also provides that women are required </p><p>to obtain permission from a male family member before having </p><p>an application for a passport processed.  Some men take their </p><p>wives\' and children\'s passports and other identification </p><p>documents with them while traveling abroad to prevent their </p><p>family from leaving the country (see Section 5).  General </p><p>Jeremiah Useni, a retired general and former Minister of the </p><p>Federal Capital Territories under the Abacha regime, was </p><p>prevented in August from traveling outside Nigeria and his </p><p>passport was confiscated.  No reason was given by the FG for </p><p>this action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prominent human rights and prodemocracy activists who fled </p><p>the country during the regime of General Sani Abacha </p><p>continued to return to the country as did many economic </p><p>refugees.  There were no reports that the Government denied </p><p>passports to political figures or journalists or interrogated </p><p>citizens who were issued visas to foreign countries; however, </p><p>there have been sporadic reports that persons still were </p><p>questioned upon entry or exit to the country at Murtala </p><p>Muhammed international airport. These persons, all of whom </p><p>were opponents of the Abacha regime, were identified in </p><p>immigration computer systems as individuals to be questioned </p><p>by immigration or security officers.  For example, Dr. Olua </p><p>Kamalu, deputy president of MOSOP, reported that the SSS </p><p>seized his passport on July 25, 2000.  Dr. Kamalu was </p><p>planning a trip to Ghana to attend a visa interview at a </p><p>foreign embassy. 2001 example available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During periods of civil unrest, numerous persons were </p><p>displaced from their places of residence.  Thousands of </p><p>persons, both Christian and Muslim, were displaced internally </p><p>following the Kaduna riots in February and in May, 2000. </p><p>Most had returned by 2001, and in fact, Kaduna became a place </p><p>of refuge for people of all ethnic groups fleeing violence in </p><p>Jos, Tafawa Balewa and Kano.  Up to 500,000 persons were </p><p>displaced following the ethnic conflict between Tiv, Jukun </p><p>and Hausa in Nasarawa State (see Section 2.c.).  Several </p><p>thousand Hausa families fled Tafawa Balewa after what was </p><p>essentially a pogrom by the predominant Siyawa ethnic group </p><p>in southern Bauchi State.  Bauchi Governor Mu\'azu admitted </p><p>that essentially the entire Hausa community in Tafawa Balewa </p><p>had either departed or had been killed in the conflict (see </p><p>Section 1.a.).  Following civil unrest created largely by </p><p>criminal opportunists in Kano in October, many Igbo and </p><p>Yoruba residents sent their families south. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Typically, only the head of household returned to areas of </p><p>unrest after authorities regained control. Most returnees </p><p>remained apprehensive about continuing to work in these areas </p><p>and returned only to finish business contracts or to sell </p><p>their homes in order to arrange a more organized departure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few hundred residents of the Odi village, razed by soldiers </p><p>in 1999, have returned to the area; however the federal </p><p>Government has not provided them with assistance to </p><p>reconstruct their village (see Section 1.a.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigerian law contains provisions for the granting of refugee </p><p>and asylum status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention </p><p>Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. </p><p>The Government cooperated with the Lagos office of the U.N. </p><p>High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian </p><p>agencies in assisting refugees through the National </p><p>Commission for Refugees and its Federal Commissioner. The </p><p>Eligibility Committee established under Decree 52 of 1989, </p><p>which governs the granting of refugee status, asylum, and </p><p>resettlement, reviews refugee and resettlement applications. </p><p>A representative from the UNHCR participates in this </p><p>committee.  The issue of the provision of first asylum has </p><p>not arisen since the establishment of the National Commission </p><p>for Refugees under Decree 52. </p><p>At year\'s end, there were 6,933 recognized refugees: 13 from </p><p>Angola; 23 from Benin; 4 from Cameroon; 1,703 from Sierra </p><p>Leone; 3,194 from Chad; 74 from Sudan; 1,561 from Liberia; 69 </p><p>from Cote d\'Ivoire; and 292 from other countries.  The </p><p>Government also resettled in the country 3 Cameroonians, 3 </p><p>Chadians, 5 Sudanese, 13 Liberians, and 17 persons from other </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a </p><p>country where they feared persecution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of </p><p>Citizens to Change Their Government </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 1998 and 1999 citizens had the opportunity to exercise </p><p>their right to change their government.  General Abdulsalami </p><p>Abubakar oversaw a transition to civilian rule that included </p><p>elections for local governments (in December 1998), state </p><p>governors and assemblies (in January 1999), and national </p><p>legislators and the president (in February 1999).  Voter </p><p>apathy and widespread fraud marred the legislative elections; </p><p>however, the turnout increased for the presidential race, </p><p>which proceeded peacefully with reports of only a few violent </p><p>incidents.  The Independent National Electoral Commission </p><p>(INEC) certified former President Olusegun Obasanjo\'s victory </p><p>over Chief Olu Falae with a reported 62 percent of the votes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Irregularities occurred at each stage of the electoral </p><p>process, particularly the presidential nominating convention </p><p>and election where, for example, large sums of money were </p><p>offered by both political camps to delegates to vote against </p><p>political opponents.  During the presidential election, </p><p>international observers and foreign diplomats witnessed </p><p>serious irregularities in procedures.  All three parties </p><p>engaged in the local purchase of false ballots and fraudulent </p><p>tally sheets so that there were vast discrepancies between </p><p>what observers saw and inflated tallies in some areas.  In </p><p>addition there were administrative problems such as late </p><p>delivery of voting materials at a large number of polling </p><p>stations.  Those areas with the worst problems were the </p><p>southern tier of states in the Niger Delta region, several </p><p>states in Igboland, and a handful of north central states. </p><p>The production of "ghost votes" in these states amounted to </p><p>as much as 70 or 80 percent of the total reported votes. </p><p>Although all parties engaged in attempts to rig the vote, the </p><p>PDP machine in the Delta and Igboland was responsible for the </p><p>worst excesses. These votes may have added an estimated 15 </p><p>percent to Obasanjo\'s total figure; however, observers </p><p>believe that even if they were thrown out, he still would </p><p>have maintained roughly a 15 percent lead over Falae\'s total. </p><p> International observers confirmed the results and stated </p><p>that, despite widespread fraud, Obasanjo\'s victory reflected </p><p>the will of most voters. Although Falae initially protested </p><p>the election results, eventually he dropped his legal </p><p>challenge.  INEC issued a report on the conduct of the </p><p>election in July 1999 that documented the fraud.  Obasanjo, </p><p>109 senators, 360 members of the House of the National </p><p>Assembly, and 36 governors and state assemblies assumed </p><p>office on May 29, 1999. The President, Vice President, and </p><p>other national and state officials serve 4-year terms. The </p><p>next state and national elections are scheduled for 2003, </p><p>while local government elections are scheduled for 2002. </p><p>INEC is working with several international electoral </p><p>assistance organizations to help improve the process in 2003; </p><p>however, no INEC officials have faced disciplinary action as </p><p>result of their involvement in corrupt activities in the 1999 </p><p>election.  The Constitution outlaws the seizure of the </p><p>government by force and contains provisions for the removal </p><p>of the President, Vice President, ministers, legislators, and </p><p>state government officials for gross misconduct or medical </p><p>reasons.  In November 1999, Senate President Evan Enwerem was </p><p>removed after another credentials scandal.  His replacement, </p><p>Chuba Okadigbo, was removed in August after an internal </p><p>Senate investigation on contracting procedures resulted in </p><p>his indictment.  Several other public officials were </p><p>subjected to close scrutiny by the press, public, and </p><p>legislative investigators. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The political system remains in transition.  The three </p><p>branches of the new government acted somewhat independently </p><p>during the Administration\'s third year in office.  The </p><p>President was instrumental in removing former Senate </p><p>President Chuba Okadigbo in 2000, and continued to fight to </p><p>remove Speaker Ghali Na\'abba in early 2001.  He abandoned </p><p>this approach after evidence came to light of widespread </p><p>fraud and corruption in the attempt to buy votes for </p><p>Na\'abba\'s removal.  The Senate and the House of </p><p>Representatives legislative responsibilities such as budget </p><p>review and oversight, the election reform initiative and </p><p>resource allocation seriously.  Obasanjo created several </p><p>commissions to investigate past government contracts and </p><p>human rights abuses, which were overwhelmed with applications </p><p>to present evidence of wrongdoing (see Section 4).  However, </p><p>the judicial branch remained weakened by years of neglect and </p><p>politicization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Abubakar\'s military Government, which consulted with a </p><p>selected group of constitutional and legal experts around the </p><p>country to revise the 1979 and 1995 Constitutions, </p><p>promulgated the 1999 Constitution on May 5, 1999.  The </p><p>constitution-writing process was criticized for not being </p><p>open to enough participants and for not being subjected to </p><p>wider debate on the country\'s federal structure, revenue </p><p>allocation and power-sharing formulas, and minority ethnic </p><p>groups\' rights.  Complaints about the Constitution persisted </p><p>and there were continued calls for a national conference, </p><p>many from groups in the southwest.  A bill for a national </p><p>conference was introduced in the Senate late in the year. </p><p>They looked instead to the constitutional reform committee in </p><p>the Senate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Special Advisor to President Obasanjo on Constitutional </p><p>Matters Dr. Maxwell Gidado heads a process which gathered </p><p>information from citizen groups in various parts of the </p><p>country on reform of the 1999 Constitution.  His findings </p><p>will be presented by the President to the National Assembly </p><p>for consideration.  (I am not sure of exact process or </p><p>whether findings have been presented yet.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although the Constitution allows the free formation of </p><p>political parties, only three parties were registered with </p><p>the INEC.  The Constitution requires parties to have </p><p>membership in two-thirds of the country\'s 36 states.  In </p><p>anticipation of the 2003 election INEC began preparing a </p><p>draft electoral law for the National Assembly to consider in </p><p>the next legislative session.  In 2000, public fora were held </p><p>during the year in all 36 states and the federal capital </p><p>territory of Abuja to solicit citizens\' views on the draft </p><p>law.  Over 10,000 citizens participated, however, the draft </p><p>law was not subject to much public debate outside of this </p><p>exercise.  The proposed law seeks to regulate the timing of </p><p>elections and the eligibility of independent parties to </p><p>register.  Because of the propensity for violence and unrest </p><p>during elections, and in order to prevent an unfair advantage </p><p>accruing to incumbents, there is substantial pressure to </p><p>reschedule local government elections, currently set for </p><p>April 2002, so that presidential, gubernatorial and local </p><p>government occur in 2003.  Conflicting bills regarding both </p><p>timing of elections and eligibility of new parties are </p><p>pending in the Senate and House. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Women are underrepresented in government and politics, </p><p>although there were no legal impediments to political </p><p>participation or voting by women. Men continued to dominate </p><p>the political arena.  NGO\'s continued to protest the </p><p>underrepresentation of women in the political process, and </p><p>women were underrepresented in the new civilian government. </p><p>Only 6 women were appointed as ministers out of a total of 56 </p><p>positions.  There were 3 women among the Senate\'s 109 </p><p>members, and only 12 women were elected to the 360-member </p><p>House of Representatives.  Women\'s rights groups pushed </p><p>local, state, and the Federal Government (and local levels as </p><p>well) to adopt a 30 percent affirmative action program; </p><p>however, these efforts were unsuccessful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no legal impediments to participation in government </p><p>by members of any ethnic group.  The Constitution requires </p><p>that government appointments reflect the country\'s "federal </p><p>character."  However, there are more than 250 ethnic groups, </p><p>and it is difficult to insure representation of every group </p><p>in the Government.  The federal- and state-level ministers </p><p>generally are selected to represent the country\'s and the </p><p>individual State,s regional, ethnic, and religious makeup. </p><p>President Obasanjo attempted to create an ethnically </p><p>inclusive Government.  The 56-member Cabinet and 109 </p><p>ambassadorial slots were allocated to an equal number of </p><p>candidates from each state to achieve a regional balance. </p><p>Despite this effort, northerners and southeasterners </p><p>criticized the Government for favoring westerners or ethnic </p><p>Yorubas, while the southwesterners criticized the Government </p><p>for relying too heavily on northern and southeastern </p><p>appointments. </p><p>Middle-belt and Christian officers dominate the military </p><p>hierarchy.  Military retirements in 2000, few in number, </p><p>appeared to reflect normal political and military </p><p>decision-making, and appeared to be based on the perceived </p><p>needs of the military and country, without reflecting an </p><p>ethnic or religious bias.  Due to the retirement of many </p><p>"political" officers in 1999, there is a perception among </p><p>some in the north that the historical northern Hausa </p><p>influence on the military has been reduced to the point where </p><p>the North is now underepresented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and </p><p>Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human </p><p>Rights </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government permitted local human rights groups to operate </p><p>and did not interfere with their activities; nor did it </p><p>detain, intimidate, or harass their members.  Criticisms of </p><p>the Government\'s past human rights record were abundant in </p><p>various media. High-level government officials noted that the </p><p>human rights community assisted in the advancement of </p><p>democracy.  In June President Obasanjo, along with a number </p><p>of cabinet members and National Assembly members, met with a </p><p>number of prominent human rights representatives for </p><p>discussions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Catholic Secretariat, a local sectarian interest group, </p><p>continued to hold a monthly open forum in Lagos on various </p><p>subjects relating to past and present human rights issues. </p><p>Discussion panels have included a number of NGO\'s, media, and </p><p>religious leaders.  Each session ended with recommendations </p><p>to the Government on how best to resolve these issues.  The </p><p>Government had not responded to any of these recommendations </p><p>at year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is </p><p>active, with offices in Abuja and Lagos under the direction </p><p>of a regional delegate.  Its primary human rights activities </p><p>during the year involved the training of prison officials on </p><p>human rights, sanitation, and prisoner health. </p><p>The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established </p><p>by Decree 22 in 1995 and tasked with monitoring and </p><p>protecting human rights in the country, enjoyed greater </p><p>recognition by and coordination with NGO\'s.  The NHRC is </p><p>chaired by retired Justice Uche Omo and includes 15 other </p><p>members. The NHRC is establishing zonal affiliates in each of </p><p>the countries six political regions.  The NHRC is supposed to </p><p>work closely with NGO\'s that are devoted to human rights </p><p>issues.  Since its inception, the NHRC has been denied </p><p>adequate funding to do its job properly.  At year\'s end, the </p><p>NHRC had created a strategic work plan through 2002, and was </p><p>in the process of developing a national action plan to be </p><p>deposited with the UNCHR.   In 2001, it began actively to </p><p>assist in appealing extreme Shari\'a verdicts in the North. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The HRVIP, commonly known as the Oputa panel, was established </p><p>in June 1999 by President Obasanjo to investigate human </p><p>rights abuses dating to 1966 and the time of the first </p><p>military coup.  The Oputa panel can recommend courses of </p><p>action to the justice system for perpetrators of past abuses, </p><p>something the NHRC does not do.  According to Justice Oputa, </p><p>the chair, the panel\'s primary goal is to provide the country </p><p>with a systematic examination of past human rights abuses to </p><p>develop a national consensus on the boundaries of acceptable </p><p>behavior by government entities as well as individuals.  The </p><p>panel has heard cases throughout the year, mostly involving </p><p>allegations of unlawful arrest, detention, and torture as far </p><p>back as the 1966 Biafran War.  The panel has also heard cases </p><p>in which the rights of groups were violated.  The Oputa Panel </p><p>has held extensive hearings in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, </p><p>and Kano throughout the year, and has taken evidence in the </p><p>claims of over 10,000 petitioners.  The work of the Panel has </p><p>produced some controversy when former Heads of State, Ibrahim </p><p>Babangida, Abdulsalami Abubakar, and Salisu Buhari refused to </p><p>appear to answer questions about human rights abuses under </p><p>their respective regimes.  The Panel will conclude its </p><p>hearings by the end of the year, and will proceed to draft a </p><p>report and issue its findings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, </p><p>Disability, Language, or Social Status </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 1999 Constitution provides citizens with the right to </p><p>freedom from discrimination based on "community, place of </p><p>origin, ethnic group, sex, religion, or political opinion." </p><p>However, customary and religious discrimination against women </p><p>persisted, occasional religious violence was a problem, </p><p>social discrimination on the basis of both religion and </p><p>ethnicity remained widespread, and ethnic and regional </p><p>tensions continued to contribute to serious violence both </p><p>between groups of citizens and between citizens and the </p><p>security forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Women </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reports of spousal abuse are common, especially those of wife </p><p>beating.  Police normally do not intervene in domestic </p><p>disputes, which seldom are discussed publicly.  The Penal </p><p>Code permits husbands to use physical means to chastise their </p><p>wives as long as it does not result in "grievous harm," which </p><p>is defined as loss of sight, hearing, power of speech, facial </p><p>disfigurement, or other life threatening injuries.  A women\'s </p><p>rights group has estimated that spousal abuse occurs in 20 </p><p>percent of adult relationships. In more traditional areas of </p><p>the country, courts and police are reluctant to intervene to </p><p>protect women who accuse their husbands formally if the level </p><p>of alleged abuse does not exceed customary norms in the </p><p>areas.  Rape and sexual harassment continue to be problems. </p><p>Prostitution is rampant, particularly in urban areas.  A </p><p>number of states, including most northern states which have </p><p>begun the enforcement of Shari\'a law, have begun to enforce </p><p>existing laws or to introduce new laws to combat </p><p>prostitution.  All states that have adopted Shari\'a have </p><p>criminalized prostitution, which is enforced with varying </p><p>degrees of success.  Prostitution is not illegal in Lagos </p><p>State; however, authorities can use statutes that outlaw </p><p>pandering as a justification for arresting prostitutes (See </p><p>Section 6.c).  The adoption of Shari\'a-based legal systems by </p><p>northern states has led to the strong enforcement of laws </p><p>against prostitution for both adults and children (see </p><p>Section 2.c.).  Southern states, like Edo, also are </p><p>criminalizing prostitution and raising the legal age for </p><p>marriage from 16 to 18.  There is an active market for </p><p>trafficking in women to Europe, and elsewhere (see Section </p><p>6.f.).  In some parts of the country, women continue to be </p><p>harassed for social and religious reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Purdah, the Islamic practice of keeping girls and women in </p><p>seclusion from men outside the family, continued in parts of </p><p>the far north. </p><p>Women experience considerable discrimination as well as </p><p>physical abuse.  There are no laws barring women from </p><p>particular fields of employment; however women often </p><p>experience discrimination because the Government tolerates </p><p>customary and religious practices that adversely affect them. </p><p> The Nigerian NGO\'s Coalition expressed concern about </p><p>continued discrimination against women in the private sector, </p><p>particularly in access to employment, promotion to higher </p><p>professional positions, and in salary inequality.  There are </p><p>credible reports that several businesses operate with a "get </p><p>pregnant, get fired" policy.  Women remain underrepresented </p><p>in the formal sector but play an active and vital role in the </p><p>country\'s important informal economy.  While the number of </p><p>women employed in the business sector increases every year, </p><p>women do not receive equal pay for equal work and often find </p><p>it extremely difficult to acquire commercial credit or to </p><p>obtain tax deductions or rebates as heads of households. </p><p>Unmarried women in particular endure many forms of </p><p>discrimination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While some women have made considerable individual progress, </p><p>both in the academic and business world, women remain </p><p>underprivileged.  Although women are not barred legally from </p><p>owning land, under some customary land tenure systems only </p><p>men can own land, and women can gain access to land only </p><p>through marriage or family.  In addition many customary </p><p>practices do not recognize a women\'s right to inherit her </p><p>husband\'s property, and many widows were rendered destitute </p><p>when their in-laws took virtually all of the deceased </p><p>husband\'s property.  Widows are subjected to unfavorable </p><p>conditions as a result of discriminatory traditional customs </p><p>and economic deprivation.  "Confinement" is the most common </p><p>rite of deprivation to which widows are subjected, and it </p><p>occurs predominately in eastern Nigeria.  Confined widows are </p><p>under restrictions for as long as 1 year and usually are </p><p>required to shave their heads and dress in black garments. </p><p>In other areas, a widow is considered a part of her husband\'s </p><p>property, to be "inherited" by his family.  Shari,a personal </p><p>law, in contrast to traditional law and practice in many </p><p>English common law cases, protects widows property rights. </p><p>Polygamy continues to be practiced widely among all ethnic </p><p>groups and among Christians as well as Muslims and </p><p>practitioners of traditional persuasions.  Women are required </p><p>by law to obtain permission from a male family member to get </p><p>a passport (see Section 2.d.).  The testimony of women is not </p><p>equal to that of men in criminal courts.  If one woman </p><p>testifies, a second woman must also to provide testimony to </p><p>equal the weight of the testimony of one man. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Women have been affected to varying degrees by the adoption </p><p>of Shari\'a in the North.  In Zamfara state, local governments </p><p>instituted laws requiring the separation of Muslim men and </p><p>women in transportation, health care, and primary educational </p><p>services (see Section 2.c.).  Separate transportation and </p><p>health facilities for men and women already have been </p><p>implemented there.  In 2000, a non-Muslim woman was pulled </p><p>from a motorcycle and injured by vigilantes for breaking the </p><p>new rule requiring separate transportation for women in a </p><p>local government area of Zamfara State.  In January, an </p><p>unmarried 17-year-old woman was given 100 strokes of the cane </p><p>lashes for fornication and false testimony (see Sections </p><p>1.c,).  While humiliating, the caning did not appear to cause </p><p>serious injury, and the woman was reported to have walked </p><p>home after the execution of the sentence without aid.  Safiya </p><p>Hussaini was convicted of adultery in Sokoto State because </p><p>she could not prove who was responsible for her pregnancy. </p><p>Procedural irregularities were noted in her case.  In </p><p>apparent violation of traditional Shari\'a jurisprudence, some </p><p>Alkali judges appear to deny Shari\'a criminal protections to </p><p>women that they provide to men.  This tends to subject women </p><p>to harsh punishments for fornication or adultery based solely </p><p>upon the fact of pregnancy, while men are not convicted </p><p>without the requisite number of witnesses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A national network of women\'s rights NGO\'s described the </p><p>Government\'s 1998 report on the implementation of the </p><p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination </p><p>Against Women (CEDAW) for the period 1986-94 as "inaccurate" </p><p>in its positive portrayal of the status of women.  The NGO </p><p>Coalition for a Shadow Report on the Implementation of CEDAW </p><p>(NGO CEDAW Coalition) issued its alternative report in March </p><p>1999, which was critical of the Government\'s failure to </p><p>remove legal impediments and social discrimination faced by </p><p>women.  During the year, there reportedly was not much </p><p>progress made to rectify the problems described in the NGO </p><p>report. </p><p>Children </p><p>Public schools continued to be inadequate, and limited </p><p>facilities precluded access to education for many children. </p><p>The Constitution\'s general provisions call for the </p><p>Government, "when practical," to provide free, compulsory, </p><p>and universal primary education; however, despite the </p><p>President\'s commitment to compulsory education, compulsory </p><p>primary education rarely was provided, particularly in the </p><p>north (see Section 6.d.).  Girls are discriminated against in </p><p>access to education for social and economic reasons. The </p><p>literacy rate for males is 58 percent but only 41 percent for </p><p>females.  Rural girls are even more disadvantaged than their </p><p>urban counterparts.  Only 42 percent of rural girls are </p><p>enrolled in school compared with 72 percent of urban girls. </p><p>In the north, Muslim communities favor boys over girls in </p><p>deciding which children to enroll in secondary and elementary </p><p>schools.  In the south, economic hardship also restricts many </p><p>families\' ability to send girls to school and, instead, they </p><p>are directed into commercial activities such as trading and </p><p>street vending.  While the Government increased spending on </p><p>children\'s health in recent years, it seldom enforced even </p><p>the inadequate laws designed to protect the rights of </p><p>children. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cases of child abuse, abandoned infants, child prostitution, </p><p>and physically harmful child labor practices remained common </p><p>throughout the country (see Sections 6.c and 6.d.).  Although </p><p>the law stipulates that "no child shall be ordered to be </p><p>imprisoned," juvenile offenders are incarcerated routinely </p><p>along with adult criminals.  The Government only occasionally </p><p>criticized child abuse and neglect, and it made little effort </p><p>to stop customary practices harmful to children, such as the </p><p>sale of young girls into marriage (see Section 6.f.).  There </p><p>were credible reports that poor families sell their daughters </p><p>into marriage as a means of supplementing their income. </p><p>Young girls often are forced into marriage as soon as they </p><p>reach puberty, regardless of age, in order to prevent the </p><p>"indecency" associated with premarital sex. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A number of states have adopted Islamic (Shari\'a) law in </p><p>varying degrees.  While most schools in the north </p><p>traditionally have separated children by gender, it is now </p><p>required by law in Zamfara, Sokoto, and Kebbi state schools </p><p>(see Section 2.c.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There was evidence of trafficking in children (see Section </p><p>6.f.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Government publicly opposes Female Genital </p><p>Mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international </p><p>health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological </p><p>health; however, it has taken no legal action to curb the </p><p>practice.  (#) A federal law banning FGM is currently before </p><p>the National Assembly.  Because of the considerable problems </p><p>that anti-FGM groups faced at the federal level, most are </p><p>refocusing their energies to combat FGM at the state and </p><p>local government area (LGA) level.  Edo State banned FGM in </p><p>October.  Ogun, Cross River, Osun, Rivers, and Bayelsa states </p><p>banned FGM during the year.  However, the punishments imposed </p><p>are minimal, in Edo state the punishment is a $10.00 (1,000 </p><p>Naira) fine and 6 months imprisonment.  In addition once a </p><p>state legislature criminalizes FGM, NGO\'s have found that </p><p>they must convince the LGA authorities that state laws are </p><p>applicable in their districts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Women\'s Centre for Peace and Development (WOPED) </p><p>estimated that at least 50 percent of women are mutilated. </p><p>Studies conducted by the U.N. Development Systems and the </p><p>World Health Organization estimated the FGM rate at </p><p>approximately 60 percent.  However, according to local </p><p>experts, the actual prevalence may be as high as 100 percent </p><p>in some ethnic conclaves in the south.  While practiced in </p><p>all parts of the country, FGM is more predominant in the </p><p>southern and eastern zones.  Women from Northern states are </p><p>less likely to be mutilated; however, those affected are more </p><p>likely to undergo the severe type of FGM known as </p><p>infibulation.  WOPED believes that the practice is </p><p>perpetuated because of a cultural belief that uncircumcised </p><p>women are promiscuous, unclean, unsuitable for marriage, </p><p>physically undesirable, or potential health risks to </p><p>themselves and their children, especially during childbirth. </p><p>The National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives, The </p><p>Nigerian Women\'s Association, and the Nigerian Medical </p><p>Association worked to eradicate the practice and to train </p><p>health care workers on the medical effects of FGM; however, </p><p>contact with health care workers remains limited. </p><p>Nevertheless, most observers agree that the number of females </p><p>who are currently subjected to FGM is declining. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Indigenous forms of FGM vary from the simple removal of the </p><p>clitoral hood or labia minora to excision of the clitoris and </p><p>the most dangerous form, infibulation.  The age at which </p><p>females are subjected to the practice varies from the first </p><p>week of life until after a woman delivers her first child. </p><p>The Ministry of Health, women\'s groups, and many NGO\'s </p><p>sponsored public awareness projects to educate communities </p><p>about the health hazards of FGM.  The press repeatedly </p><p>criticized the practice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>People with Disabilities </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While the Government called for private business to institute </p><p>policies that ensured fair treatment for the disabled, it did </p><p>not enact any laws requiring greater accessibility to </p><p>buildings or public transportation, nor did if formulate any </p><p>policy specifically ensuring the right of the disabled to </p><p>work. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Religious Minorities </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits religious discrimination; however private </p><p>businesses frequently are guilty of informal religious </p><p>discrimination in their hiring practices and purchasing </p><p>patterns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Religious differences often correspond to regional and ethnic </p><p>differences.  For example, the northern region is </p><p>overwhelmingly Muslim, as are the large Hausa and Fulani </p><p>ethnic groups of the region.  Many southern ethnic groups are </p><p>predominantly Christian, although the Yoruba are roughly </p><p>fifty percent Muslim.  Consequently, at times it is difficult </p><p>to distinguish between religious or ethnic/regional </p><p>discrimination or tension, both of which are pervasive. </p><p>Religious tensions underscored what were predominantly ethnic </p><p>confrontations throughout the year.  The Middle Belt, because </p><p>of its particular historical circumstances, has suffered </p><p>recurring inter-religious and inter-ethnic violence during </p><p>the past two years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The crisis in Kaduna in February and May 2000 was the first </p><p>major Muslim-Christian conflict during Obasanjo\'s tenure. </p><p>Viewed through the ethnic prism, there were numerous </p><p>conflicts in Southern Kaduna between smaller ethnic groups </p><p>and the Hausa-Fulani who occupied towns, whose names are now </p><p>synonymous in Nigeria with the conflicts that occurred there: </p><p>Zangon-Kataf, Kachia, and Kafanchan.  There has not been a </p><p>similar flare up of violence this year due in part to the </p><p>government sponsored dialogue between the different faiths </p><p>and ethnic groups.  For example when two small churches were </p><p>partially burned in the northern part of Kaduna city in </p><p>October, the fires were put out through the efforts of </p><p>Christian and Muslim neighbors, and the State Government </p><p>promised funds to repair them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A violent ethnic crisis erupted in July between the Sayawa </p><p>ethnic group and Hausa/Fulani residing in Tafawa Balewa in </p><p>southern Bauchi State.  Tafawa Balewa is similar to Kafanchan </p><p>or Zangon Kataf in Kaduna state in that it is inhabited </p><p>primarily by the Muslim Hausa-Fulani, while the indigenous, </p><p>non-Muslim, Sayewa ethnic group dominates the land and </p><p>villages surrounding the town.  It is unclear how the </p><p>violence in Tafawa Balewa commenced, but it may have been </p><p>related to the proposed introduction of Shari\'a law by Bauchi </p><p>State.  Most casualties--up to one hundred dead and </p><p>significant property loss--were Hausa-Fulani.  State </p><p>authorities acted quickly to prevent a reprisal by </p><p>Hausa-Fulani against the Sayewa by calling in the military to </p><p>maintain order, but tensions in Tafawa Balewa persists.  By </p><p>mid-September, most of the Hausa-Fulani had left Tafawa </p><p>Balewa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the weekend of September 7, violence erupted in the </p><p>Jos that eventually claimed more than 2300 lives.  It is </p><p>unclear how the unrest began, but tensions had risen over the </p><p>appointment of an ethnic Hausa to the chairmanship of a local </p><p>Poverty Alleviation Program, and earlier violence between </p><p>Christian Sayewa and Musim Hausa-Fulani in Tafawa Balewa, </p><p>Bauchi, only 60 kilometers away. There were also several </p><p>reports of Hausa-Fulanis being summarily killed in outlying </p><p>villages.  Roughly eighty-percent of the casualties in Jos </p><p>were Hausa-Fulani Muslims, who constitute a significant </p><p>minority in Jos.  The military was able to restore order, but </p><p>thousands of Hausas fled Plateau state for Kaduna, Kano, </p><p>Jigawa and Bauchi.  This conflict appears to have been </p><p>primarily ethnic, and secondarily religious.  Christians of </p><p>different sects were reported to have attacked each other, </p><p>and Yoruba Muslims reportedly joined in the killing of their </p><p>Hausa co-religionists.  The Jos conflict produced </p><p>approximately 11,600 internally displaced persons according </p><p>to the Nigerian Red Cross. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In October 12, 600 to 1000 Muslims peacefully demonstrated in </p><p>Kano against U.S. and allied air strikes against Afghanistan. </p><p> However, several hours after the demonstration two small </p><p>churches were burned.  The following morning, a mob of </p><p>predominantly Hausa youth began attacking shopkeepers and </p><p>looting shops in city,s major market.  The military was </p><p>called in to restore order and did so successfully.  The </p><p>violence appeared to be primarily opportunistic and </p><p>criminally inspired but with religious and ethnic overtones, </p><p>with gangs trying to foment unrest in order to loot. Churches </p><p>and three mosques were reportedly burned during the fighting. </p><p> After order was restored, Governor Kwankwaso held a series </p><p>of meetings with local ethnic and religious leaders to stem </p><p>further outbreaks and to rebuild trust between the </p><p>communities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The country\'s population of about 120 million is ethnically </p><p>diverse, and consists of more than 250 groups, many of which </p><p>speak distinct primary languages and are concentrated </p><p>geographically.  There is no majority ethnic group.  The </p><p>three largest ethnic groups, the Hausa-Fulani of the north, </p><p>the Yoruba of the southwest, and the Igbos of the southeast, </p><p>together make up about two-thirds of the population.  The </p><p>Ijaw of the South Delta area, the fourth largest group, claim </p><p>a population of 12 million, roughly the same as the Kanuri </p><p>population in the far northeast and Tiv population in the </p><p>south.  Because of the lack of reliable statistics, it is </p><p>difficult to determine the populations of the various ethnic </p><p>groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits ethnic discrimination by the </p><p>Government.  In addition the Constitution mandates that the </p><p>composition of the federal, state, and local governments and </p><p>their agencies, as well as the conduct of their affairs, </p><p>reflect the diverse character of the country in order to </p><p>promote national unity and loyalty.  This provision was </p><p>designed as a safeguard against domination of the Government </p><p>by persons from a few states or ethnic and sectional groups. </p><p>These provisions were included in response to previous </p><p>domination of the Government and the armed forces by </p><p>northerners and Muslims.  In fact, many argue that the </p><p>informal, though immutable rules of regional and ethnic </p><p>"zoning" substantially outweigh the Constitution, because </p><p>they are the implicit rules by which Nigerians agree to </p><p>remain in one nation.  The Government of Olusegun Obasanjo </p><p>was an example of this diversity. Obasanjo is a Yoruba from </p><p>the southwest, the Vice President is a northerner, and the </p><p>Senate President is an Igbo.  President Obasanjo assiduously </p><p>followed the unwritten rules of zoning in making key </p><p>appointments: essentially, each state must have at least gets </p><p>one minister and one minister of state.  While this makes for </p><p>an unwieldly cabinet and can make geographic or ethnic </p><p>provenance outweigh considerations of competence, this system </p><p>can not be dispensed with easily.  The political parties also </p><p>engaged in "zoning," the practice of rotating positions </p><p>within the party among the different regions and ethnicities </p><p>to ensure that each region and ethnicity is given adequate </p><p>representation.  Nonetheless, claims of marginalization by </p><p>members of southern minority groups and Igbos continued.  The </p><p>ethnic groups of the Niger Delta, in particular, continued </p><p>their calls for high-level representation on petroleum issues </p><p>and within the security forces.  Northern Muslims, who lost </p><p>previously held positions within the military hierarchy, </p><p>accused the Obasanjo Government of favoring  Christians from </p><p>the Middle Belt for those positions.  Traditional linkages </p><p>continued to impose considerable pressure on individual </p><p>government officials to favor their own ethnic groups for </p><p>important positions and patronage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Societal discrimination on the basis of ethnicity is widely </p><p>practiced by members of all ethnic groups and is evident in </p><p>private sector hiring patterns, de facto ethnic segregation </p><p>of urban neighborhoods, and a continuing paucity of marriages </p><p>across major ethnic and regional lines.  There is a long </p><p>history of tension among the diverse ethnic groups (see </p><p>Section 1.a.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Significant inter-ethnic clashes were reported in Delta, </p><p>Anambra, Bauchi, Plateau, Nassarawa, Rivers, Benue, Bayelsa, </p><p>Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Ebonyi States, often resulting in </p><p>fatalities (see Sections 1.a, 5.d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Competing economic aspirations among smaller ethnic groups </p><p>related to the control and powers of subnational governments </p><p>occasionally led to violent conflict. This competition is </p><p>often expressed in terms of "indigene" versus "immigrant." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The crisis in Jos, despite its religious overtones, was </p><p>partially precipitated by indigenous ethnic groups in order </p><p>to drive out or deny Hausa-Fulani "immigrants" access to the </p><p>resources of Plateau State--even though immigrant Hausa </p><p>settlers originally founded Jos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A recurring conflict over land rights and status continued </p><p>for several months between the Tiv, the Kwalla, the Jukun and </p><p>the Azara ethnic groups.  These groups all reside in or near </p><p>the convergence of Nasarawa, Benue and Taraba states.    The </p><p>Tiv, who are thought to have originated in the East African </p><p>highlands, migrated to central Nigeria hundreds of years ago. </p><p> Tivs are regarded as interlopers by the "indigenous" ethnic </p><p>groups, except in parts of Benue State where the Tiv </p><p>predominate.  The conflict began in southeastern Nasarawa </p><p>state June 12 when Alhaji Musa Ibrahim, a chief of the </p><p>Hausa-speaking Azara ethnic group, was assassinated by a </p><p>group of local Tiv.  Hundreds may have been killed in the </p><p>ensuing conflict, which was eventually stopped by the </p><p>military, with nearly 30,000 Tiv migrating south to Benue </p><p>State.  In July, the conflict spread to Taraba State and </p><p>involved the Jukun ethnic group attacking the Tiv. </p><p>Twenty-five people were reported killed and 25,000 Tiv fled </p><p>Taraba for camps on Benue and Nasarawa.  Tensions in Makurdi, </p><p>Benue State, rose over the influx of Tiv, and nearly resulted </p><p>in ethnic conflict there in September. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Other ethnic minorities, particularly in Delta, Rivers, </p><p>Bayelsa, and Akwa Ibom states, have echoed the Ogoni ethnic </p><p>group\'s claims of environmental degradation and government </p><p>indifference to their development in the Delta.  Groups such </p><p>as the Ijaw, Itsekiri, Urhobo, and Isoko continued to express </p><p>their unhappiness about their perceived economic exploitation </p><p>and the environmental destruction of their homelands, and </p><p>incidents of ethnic conflict and confrontation with </p><p>government forces increased in the delta area, particularly </p><p>after the Ijaw Youth Council issued the Kaiama Declaration in </p><p>December 1998 (see Section 1.a.).  Other ethnic groups saw </p><p>the Kaiama Declaration, which claims the entire Delta the </p><p>property of the Ijaw, as threatening their rights. Disparate </p><p>organizations of youths from a variety of ethnic groups </p><p>continued to take oil company personnel hostage in the delta </p><p>region (see Section 1.b.).  For example, in June, an Ijaw </p><p>group took around 60 people hostage at an oil facility at </p><p>Bonny Island, Rivers State.  The group alleged that the land </p><p>where the facility was situated had been obtained illegally. </p><p>As a result of this ongoing violence, many oil companies </p><p>continued to employ local police, and in some cases military </p><p>troops, to protect their facilities and personnel.  Local </p><p>youths claimed that these "militias" engaged in extrajudicial </p><p>killings and other human rights abuses, in some cases with </p><p>the support of foreign oil companies (see Section 1.a.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), an entity </p><p>created in October 2000 to increase government resources </p><p>committed to the area and grant more local autonomy over </p><p>expenditure of these resources, achieved little while plans </p><p>to source its financing remained contentiously debated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 6. Worker Rights </p><p>The Right of Association </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 1999 Constitution gives all citizens the right to </p><p>assemble freely and associate with other persons, and to form </p><p>or belong to any trade union or other association.  However, </p><p>several statutory restrictions on the individual\'s right of </p><p>association, and on trade unions, remain in effect despite </p><p>repeals of most military-era anti-labor decrees.  These </p><p>restrictions include: permitting only a single central labor </p><p>federation (the Nigerian Labour Congress); requiring trade </p><p>unions to be formally registered by the Federal Government; </p><p>requiring a minimum of 50 workers to form a trade union; </p><p>recognizing only 29 trade unions; preventing non-management </p><p>senior staff from joining registered trade unions; and, </p><p>denying senior staff associations a seat on the National </p><p>Labor Advisory Council (NLAC).  Several of these restrictions </p><p>were cited by an ILO committee of experts in 1999.  The </p><p>government has yet to amend these laws, but has conducted </p><p>discussions with senior staff associations concerning formal </p><p>recognition and their accession to the NLAC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Certain categories of Nigerian workers are not permitted to </p><p>join trade unions, including members of the armed forces, and </p><p>government employees in the police, customs, immigration, </p><p>prisons, federal mint, central bank, and telecommunications. </p><p>Certain workers engaged in an "essential service" are </p><p>required to provide advance notice of a strike.  Essential </p><p>services include banking, postal services, transportation, </p><p>public health, and utilities.  Employees working in a </p><p>designated export-processing zone may not join a union until </p><p>ten years after the start-up of the enterprise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>According to figures provided by the Nigerian Labour </p><p>Congress, total union membership is approximately four </p><p>million.  Less than ten percent of the total work force is </p><p>organized.  With the exception of a small number of workers </p><p>engaged in commercial food processing, the agricultural </p><p>sector, which employs the bulk of the work force, is not </p><p>organized.  The informal sector, and small and medium </p><p>enterprises, remain largely unorganized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since 1978 the government has mandated a single trade union </p><p>structure with service and industrial unions grouped under </p><p>the NLC.  The trade union movement is composed of two groups </p><p>consisting of junior and senior staff workers.  The single </p><p>trade union structure and segregation of junior from senior </p><p>staff were intended by government to dilute labor\'s </p><p>bargaining strength.  Junior staff workers--primarily </p><p>blue-collar workers--are organized into 29 industrial unions </p><p>with a membership of approximately four million persons and </p><p>are affiliated with the NLC.  Twenty-one associations make up </p><p>the senior staff associations of Nigeria, which have renamed </p><p>themselves the trade union congress (TUC).  The TUC has a </p><p>claimed membership of approximately 400,000 to 600,000.  The </p><p>TUC -- primarily white-collar workers--has not been </p><p>officially sanctioned by the government, is prohibited by </p><p>statute from affiliating with the NLC.  Although it lacks a </p><p>seat on the National Labor Advisory Council, the government </p><p>has commenced discussions concerning its accession to the </p><p>body.  Sescan has begun to lay the political groundwork to </p><p>achieve government recognition, which will require formal </p><p>action by the national assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Strikes occurred in May and June by the doctors and </p><p>university professors over wages, working conditions, and </p><p>government investment in infrastructure.  Both actions were </p><p>resolved following lengthy negotiations with the relevant </p><p>government ministries, and are significant in that labor </p><p>extracted government commitments to budget greater funds for </p><p>development of the nation\'s moribund health and education </p><p>infrastructures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Smaller strikes plagued the oil sector, particularly in the </p><p>areas of operation in the Niger delta.  The principal issues </p><p>raised by NUPENG (National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas </p><p>Workers) and its senior staff counterpart PENGASSAN </p><p>(Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of </p><p>Nigeria) are the increasing use of contract labor and the </p><p>number of indigenous workers in management positions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no laws prohibiting retribution against strikers </p><p>and strike leaders.  Lagos State Government terminated an </p><p>important local union leader in Lagos, ostensibly for </p><p>nonperformance, following an extended and acrimonious strike </p><p>by state government workers.  Strikers who believe that they </p><p>are victims of unfair retribution may submit their cases to </p><p>the industrial arbitration panel (IAP), with the approval of </p><p>the Labor Ministry.  The IAP\'s decisions are legally binding </p><p>on the parties but may be appealed to the Nigerian Industrial </p><p>Court (NIC).  In practice the decisions of these bodies </p><p>infrequently carry the force of law.  Union representatives </p><p>describe the arbitration process as cumbersome and </p><p>time-consuming, and an ineffective deterrent to employer </p><p>retribution. </p><p>B. The right to organize and bargain collectively </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The labor laws provide for the right to organize and to </p><p>bargain collectively.  Collective bargaining occurs </p><p>throughout the public sector and organized private sector. </p><p>Complaints of anti-union discrimination may be brought to the </p><p>Ministry of Labor for resolution.  The Labor Minister may </p><p>refer unresolved disputes to the IAP and the NIC (see Section </p><p>6.a.).  Union officials have questioned the effectiveness and </p><p>independence of the NIC in view of its refusal in previous </p><p>years to resolve various disputes stemming from the </p><p>government\'s failure to fulfill contract provisions for </p><p>public sector employees.  The NIC was reconstituted this year </p><p>with several new members, including a formerly imprisoned </p><p>trade unionist, Milton Dabibi.  Union leaders have criticized </p><p>the arbitration system\'s dependence on the labor minister\'s </p><p>referrals.  The Labor Minister typically makes few referrals </p><p>to the IAP.  The IAP and NIC are now active following the </p><p>government\'s appointment of new members, but sorely lacking </p><p>in resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the law, a worker under a collective bargaining </p><p>agreement may not strike unless his union has met the </p><p>requirements of the Trade Disputes Act, including mandatory </p><p>mediation and referral of the dispute to the Government.  The </p><p>act allows the Government in its discretion to refer the </p><p>matter to a labor conciliator, arbitration panel, board of </p><p>inquiry, or the National Industrial Court.  The Act forbids </p><p>any employer from granting a general wage increase to its </p><p>workers without prior government approval.  In practice, </p><p>however, the law is widely ignored.  Public and private </p><p>sector strikes are widespread, and private sector wage </p><p>increases are not submitted to the government for prior </p><p>approval. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The government retains broad legal authority over labor </p><p>matters and often intervenes in disputes seen to challenge </p><p>key political or economic objectives.  But the era of </p><p>government domination of unions through handpicked "sole </p><p>administrators" is now over.  The labor movement is </p><p>increasingly active and strident on issues affecting the </p><p>ordinary worker.  During 2001 the Nigeria Labour Congress in </p><p>particular has spoken out often on issues ranging from </p><p>economic reform, fuel price deregulation, privatization, </p><p>globalization, tariffs, corruption, contract workers, and </p><p>political issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The labor movement in February gathered in Abuja to form a </p><p>"civil-society-based" political party, which would feature </p><p>strong labor representation.  Although the event generated </p><p>much interest and attracted senior government attendance, </p><p>funding for the party remains a sticking point. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The government has directed each state administration to </p><p>establish its own salary structure based on its ability to </p><p>pay and in accord with the national minimum wage (see section </p><p>6.e.).  The government\'s decision, taken without broad </p><p>consultation, caught several states by surprise.  Many state </p><p>governments have found it difficult to pay the approximately </p><p>$60 (6500 Naira) monthly minimum wage to their employees, </p><p>without massive layoffs, and the elimination of "ghost </p><p>workers." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>An export-processing zone (EPZ) is being developed in </p><p>Calabar, Cross River State, and a second is planned for Port </p><p>Harcourt, Rivers State.  Workers and employers in such zones </p><p>are subject to national labor laws, which provide for a </p><p>ten-year amnesty on trade unions from the startup of an </p><p>enterprise.  This feature of Nigeria\'s EPZ framework </p><p>attracted negative comment from the ILO. </p><p>c. Prohibition of forced or compulsory labor </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 1974 Labor Decree and the 1999 Constitution prohibit </p><p>forced or compulsory labor.  However, trafficking in women </p><p>and children for purposes of forced prostitution and forced </p><p>labor is a problem (see section 6.f), and enforcement of the </p><p>law is not effective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although employment of persons under 18 years of age </p><p>generally is prohibited, except for agriculture and domestic </p><p>work, the government does not specifically prohibit forced </p><p>and bonded labor by children.  There are occasional reports </p><p>of forced child labor, including child slavery rings </p><p>operating between Nigeria and neighboring countries (see </p><p>sections 5 and 6.f).  The reports suggest that Nigerian </p><p>children are exported to other African countries for domestic </p><p>and agricultural work.  Children from neighboring countries </p><p>are also imported to Nigeria for work as domestic servants. </p><p>d. Status of child labor practices and minimum age for </p><p>employment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 1974 Labor Decree prohibits employment of children less </p><p>than 15 years of age in commerce and industry, and restricts </p><p>other child labor to home-based agricultural or domestic </p><p>work.  The law states that children may not be employed in </p><p>agricultural or domestic work for more than 8 hours per day. </p><p>The decree allows the apprenticeship of youths at the age 13 </p><p>under specific conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Primary education is compulsory, although this requirement </p><p>rarely is enforced.  Studies indicate declining school </p><p>enrollment due to deteriorated public schools and increased </p><p>economic pressures on families.  The lack of sufficient </p><p>primary schools and the high cost of school fees limits many </p><p>families\' access to education, inducing them to place their </p><p>children in the labor market.  Economic hardship leads to </p><p>high numbers of children in commercial activities aimed at </p><p>enhancing meager family income.  Children are frequently </p><p>employed as beggars, hawkers, and bus conductors in urban </p><p>areas.  The use of children as domestic servants is common. </p><p>According to an ILO statement in 1998, and data from UNICEF, </p><p>the incidence of child prostitution is growing (see section </p><p>5). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 1974 Labor Decree and the 1999 constitution prohibit </p><p>forced or compulsory labor, a prohibition that extends to </p><p>children, although they are not mentioned specifically in the </p><p>laws.  There continue to be cases of trafficking in children </p><p>as indentured servants or for criminal activities such as </p><p>prostitution (see section 6.f.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Private and government initiatives to stem the growing </p><p>incidence of child employment exist but are ineffective, </p><p>given the size of the problem, and the need for a </p><p>well-functioning legal system.  UNICEF operates programs that </p><p>remove young girls from the street hawking trade and relocate </p><p>them to informal educational settings.  UNICEF believes it is </p><p>only scratching the surface of the problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In conjunction with the ILO, the government is building a </p><p>national program of action in support of child rights, </p><p>survival, protection, development and participation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The labor ministry has an inspections department whose major </p><p>responsibilities include enforcement of legal provisions </p><p>relating to conditions of work and protection of workers. </p><p>There are less than 50 inspectors for the entire country. </p><p>The ministry conducts inspections only in the formal business </p><p>sector, in which the incidence of child labor is not </p><p>significant. </p><p>E. Acceptable conditions of work </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 1974 Labor Decree set a minimum wage, which is reviewed </p><p>from time to time.  Private sector minimum wages increased </p><p>this year to match the 2000 increase in the public sector </p><p>wage scale.  However, the statutory private sector minimum </p><p>wage is irrelevant because real private sector wages greatly </p><p>exceed the minimum wage.  In early 2001 the national police </p><p>went unpaid for several months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 1974 Labor Decree calls for a 40-hour workweek, two to </p><p>four weeks annual leave, and overtime and holiday pay.  The </p><p>1974 Labor Decree sets out general health and safety </p><p>provisions, some of which are aimed specifically at young or </p><p>female workers.  It requires that the factory division of the </p><p>Ministry of Labor and Employment inspect factories for </p><p>compliance with health and safety standards, but this agency </p><p>is greatly understaffed, lacks basic resources and training. </p><p>In addition, the labor ministry often fails to reimburse </p><p>inspectors for expenses incurred in traveling to inspection </p><p>sites.  Consequently, safety oversight of many enterprises is </p><p>widely neglected and safety standards are quite low for </p><p>indigenous enterprises. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Decree requires employers to compensate injured workers </p><p>and dependent survivors of those killed in industrial </p><p>accidents.  The Labor Ministry, which is charged with </p><p>enforcement of these laws, has been ineffective in </p><p>identifying violators.  The government has failed to action </p><p>various ILO recommendations since 1991 to update its program </p><p>on inspection and accident reporting.  The Labor Decree does </p><p>not provide workers with the right to remove themselves from </p><p>dangerous work situations without loss of employment. </p><p>F. Trafficking in persons </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No specific law makes trafficking in persons a crime.  There </p><p>is an active and growing market for trafficking in women and </p><p>children within the region and to Europe for illicit </p><p>purposes.  The full nature and scope of the trade remains </p><p>unknown, but is considered extensive.  Immigration and police </p><p>officials throughout Europe report a steady flow of Nigerian </p><p>women entrapped and sold into prostitution in Europe, </p><p>particularly Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the Czech </p><p>Republic.  Italian authorities deported several hundred sex </p><p>workers to Nigeria during the year.  Other European countries </p><p>deported smaller numbers of Nigerian trafficking victims. </p><p>Nigerian Police officials claim that Nigerian women, though </p><p>seeking emigration for economic reasons, are often recruited </p><p>and trafficked to Europe through well-organized trafficking </p><p>syndicates run by Nigerian criminals.   Evidence shows that </p><p>these Nigerian trafficking syndicates use indebtedness, </p><p>threats of beatings and/or rape, and threats of violence to </p><p>the victim,s family back in Nigeria to keep the trafficked </p><p>girls and women enslaved in European sex markets and to </p><p>discourage them from seeking assistance from European police </p><p>agencies or NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigerian police report that the families of girls and women </p><p>often condone their entry into the sex trade.  During the </p><p>past year, there was at least one documented case of </p><p>trafficking in children reported in the Lagos metropolis, </p><p>though incidents of trafficking in Lagos and other major </p><p>Nigerian cities are suspected to be commonplace.   The </p><p>absence of more documented reports is believed to be the </p><p>result of ineffective enforcement mechanisms, lack of </p><p>resources, and weak government commitment.  There is evidence </p><p>of trafficking of children to the United States and Europe, </p><p>mostly for the reunification of children with their </p><p>undocumented parents abroad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Basic economic incentives often underlie child trafficking. </p><p>Generally, families who employ children as domestic servants </p><p>(a widespread practice in West Africa) also pay their school </p><p>fees.  Child traffickers receive a monthly payment from the </p><p>employer, part of which is to be remitted to the parents of </p><p>the indentured child servant.  These traffickers take </p><p>advantage of a cultural tradition of child fostering, under </p><p>which it is culturally acceptable to send a child to live and </p><p>work with a more prosperous family in an urban center in </p><p>return for educational and vocational advancement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>According to ILO reports, there is an active and extensive </p><p>trade in child laborers, some of whom are exported to </p><p>Cameroon, Gabon, Benin and Equatorial Guinea to work in </p><p>agricultural enterprises.  Other children are coerced into </p><p>prostitution.  Authorities have identified a trade route for </p><p>traffickers of children for labor through Katsina and Sokoto </p><p>to the Middle East and east Africa.   The eastern part of </p><p>Nigeria and some southern states such as Cross Rivers and </p><p>Akwa Ibom have been the sites of trafficking of children for </p><p>labor and, in some cases, human sacrifice.  Nigeria remains a </p><p>destination for the trafficking of Togolese children.  The </p><p>ILO issued a report on child trafficking in the region that </p><p>identified Nigeria as a source area, destination and transit </p><p>area for children trafficking within and the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The government has conducted few investigations into the </p><p>alleged involvement of government officials in trafficking, </p><p>though this involvement reportedly is widespread. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There is draft legislation now under review in the National </p><p>Assembly that would make trafficking a crime.  There is </p><p>government and societal acknowledgement that trafficking in </p><p>women is a continuing problem, particularly to Europe. </p><p>Police attempts to stem the trafficking of persons are </p><p>inadequate and too often focus on the victims of trafficking, </p><p>who are often subjected to lengthy detention and public </p><p>humiliation upon repatriation to Nigeria.  In contrast, </p><p>traffickers are almost never identified and punished. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Awareness campaigns, often conducted by spouses of prominent </p><p>politicians or non-governmental entities, have only recently </p><p>begun to garner widespread attention.  There are few </p><p>statistics with which to determine if progress is being made </p><p>with these campaigns.  The development of a reliable, </p><p>statistically-valid base for assessing the child trafficking </p><p>problem has only recently begun under ILO auspices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A rare and high-profile arrest of a suspected trafficker </p><p>occurred in mid-2001.  Bisi Dan Musa, a prominent Lagos </p><p>businesswoman and wife of a former Presidential aspirant, was </p><p>arrested and charged with 19 counts of &child stealing8 </p><p>(kidnapping) and slave dealing after 16 children aged between </p><p>one and four years old were found in her custody. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In August, 33 Nigerian women and children intercepted in </p><p>Conakry, Guinea, were repatriated to Nigeria following the </p><p>personal intervention of President Obasanjo.  As of this </p><p>writing, the Nigerian Government is planning to extradite and </p><p>prosecute in Nigeria 15 Nigerian traffickers arrested by </p><p>Guinean authorities in connection with the 33 trafficked </p><p>women and girl. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
