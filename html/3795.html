<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005510 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/RA (SUTPHIN/HANDON-DAVIDSON), NEA/ARN </p><p>(ZIADEH) AND NEA/IPA (RATNEY) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, JO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: AMMAN CENTER FOR PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT SEEKS U.S. </p><p>FUNDING FOR TRACK II PROJECT: THE SECURITY DIMENSION OF THE </p><p>ARAB INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On September 19, poloff met with Dr. Muhammad Kheir </p><p>Mustafa, Director of the Amman Center for Peace and </p><p>Development (ACPD) to discuss a proposed ACPD project "to </p><p>develop an operational definition to the security aspect of </p><p>the Arab Initiative."  The ACPD, one of the few remaining </p><p>active pro-peace organizations in Jordan, has organized </p><p>meetings over the past two years between retired Jordanian </p><p>and Israeli military officers, and has participated in other </p><p>Track II activities during that time as well.  The new </p><p>project would include a series of workshops on three separate </p><p>but interrelated tracks, seeking both Arab and Israeli </p><p>perspectives on elements needed for realizable security </p><p>guarantees.  The ACPD has approached a number of possible </p><p>donors to support this project, including Canada and the NGO </p><p>Search for Common Ground.  Dr. Mustafa said the ACPD would </p><p>welcome U.S. support for their endeavor.  Details follow. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>The ACPD </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The ACPD is a small but active organization that has </p><p>sought to keep lines of communication open between Israelis </p><p>and Jordanians in the face of spiraling regional tensions and </p><p>current widespread popular opposition to "normalization" with </p><p>Israel throughout Jordanian society.  The ACPD has convened </p><p>five meetings in 2001-2002 between retired Jordanian and </p><p>Israeli military officers to discuss security and political </p><p>issues of relevance to both sides (Note: the most recent </p><p>meeting took place in Amman on August 2-3, 2002).  The ACPD </p><p>has often collaborated with Dr. Yair Hirschfeld and the </p><p>Israeli Economic Cooperation Foundation (ECF) on joint </p><p>projects. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The Concept </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Dr. Mustafa told poloff that the ACPD, in its current </p><p>proposal, seeks to move the Arab Initiative forward by </p><p>providing a non-governmental forum where Arabs and Israelis </p><p>could discuss security aspects associated with the </p><p>initiative.  Mustafa told us that "because prospective </p><p>participants would be outside of government, we could be more </p><p>creative and forthcoming about discussing the envisioned </p><p>requirements of all sides."  An informal paper outlining the </p><p>proposal states "the purpose of this project is to develop an </p><p>operational definition to the security aspect of the Arab </p><p>Initiative" and "encourage inter-Arab and Israeli-Arab </p><p>dialogue on issues of security.  The Arab Initiative is the </p><p>clearest message yet for peaceful coexistence and normal </p><p>relations between Arab States and Israel . . . Israel\'s </p><p>security concerns are addressed specifically.  It is the </p><p>purpose of this project to offer detailed operational meaning </p><p>to that (offer) of Arab security guarantees." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The proposal notes the work that had been done under </p><p>the auspices of the long-suspended ACRS Working Group.  The </p><p>new project would not seek to cover the same ground that ACRS </p><p>had, but rather look at "other possibilities" including: </p><p> </p><p>--  security agreements which might address specific issues, </p><p>including \'non-aggression\' declarations, alliances, </p><p>cooperation between intelligence agencies concerning radical </p><p>groups and individuals. </p><p> </p><p>--  setting up a security forum similar to that of the OSCE </p><p> </p><p>--  possible Arab contributions to an international </p><p>peacekeeping force in the region </p><p> </p><p>--  Drafting a legally binding Arab declaration which might </p><p>address Israeli security concerns related both to existential </p><p>threats and those of radical organizations. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>The Proposed Project </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) According to Dr. Mustafa, the project would be </p><p>centered on a series of nine workshops organized in three </p><p>interrelated tracks taking place over the course of one year: </p><p> (1) three Jordanian-Israeli meetings on Israeli perspectives </p><p>of Arab security guarantees; (2) three Inter-Arab Security </p><p>Experts meetings on Arab perspectives of Arab security </p><p>guarantees; and (3) three Arab-Israeli security experts </p><p>meetings to bridge gaps between the 1 and 2.  Meetings would </p><p>be held in Amman, Tel Aviv, Cairo, Muscat, Nicosia, and </p><p>perhaps other locations.  The project would cover the costs </p><p>of participant travel to each meeting, hotel expenses, and </p><p>related conference costs.  Each track would produce a report </p><p>of conclusions from the meetings. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Costs and Funding </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Dr. Mustafa said that the ACPD is seeking support for </p><p>this project from a number of potential donors.  The Canadian </p><p>Embassy here told us that Ottawa (which has funded ACPD </p><p>activities previously) believes the current proposal is a </p><p>worthwhile project, and is looking at possible sources of GOC </p><p>funding.  The ACPD also has been in contact with the NGO </p><p>"Search for Common Ground" regarding funding.  The ACPD would </p><p>welcome USG funding for this project and believes it would </p><p>give the endeavor added weight. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The ACPD estimates that the costs of hosting, </p><p>accommodating and paying travel expenses for participants in </p><p>the nine workshops envisioned would amount to roughly USD </p><p>132,000. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Comment and Action Request </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The ACPD is a small but dedicated organization that </p><p>has kept lines of communication with Israelis open under </p><p>difficult circumstances.  The project they have put forth </p><p>seems to us a worthwhile endeavor that could help focus </p><p>thinking on practical aspects of the Arab-Israeli dialogue. </p><p>Post seeks the Department\'s assessment of the ACPD\'s proposed </p><p>project, the possibility of USG funding, and the types of </p><p>additional information, if any, that might be needed. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
