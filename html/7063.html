(S) SUMMARY:  Honduran President Ricardo Maduro suggested </p><p>that Central American Presidents remain interested in raising </p><p>non-CAFTA topics during their upcoming meeting with President </p><p>Bush.  He also reaffirmed his commitment to provide Honduran </p><p>troops for post-conflict operations in Iraq, even while he </p><p>acknowledged weak public statements of support by the </p><p>Honduran UN Permanent Representative at last week\'s UNSC </p><p>session.  Maduro concurred that the GOH would review any </p><p>actions in Cuba in light of Fidel Castro,s recent crackdown </p><p>on human rights activists.  Finally, he flagged continuing </p><p>political problems in addressing the escalating public wage </p><p>bill, in particular the challenge of breaking a crippling </p><p>doctors\' strike.  He indicated that an IMF agreement remains </p><p>a top priority but said differences remained between the </p><p>Government of Honduras and the IMF. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador met one-on-one with President Maduro at the </p><p>Casa Presidencial March 28.  Ambassador subsequently met with </p><p>Foreign Minister Perez-Cadalso on April 1 to discuss Iraq and </p><p>other key issues (septel). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>April 10 Central American Presidents Visit </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) President Maduro opened the discussion by raising the </p><p>upcoming meeting between the five Central American presidents </p><p>and President Bush scheduled for April 10 in Washington. </p><p>Maduro reiterated that each president had been assigned </p><p>specific topics to raise with the President and would take a </p><p>regional rather than bilateral approach.  He emphasized that </p><p>the Central American presidents wanted to present their </p><p>vision for the future of the region to the President. </p><p>Specifically, the Presidents had laid out that vision in the </p><p>Roatan Declaration.  The list follows:  Agriculture and the </p><p>asymmetry which should govern our future commercial relations </p><p>(Costa Rica); Central American security, the fight against </p><p>narcotrafficking, terrorism and organized crime (El </p><p>Salvador); Disarmament and reduction of arms in the region </p><p>(Nicaragua); Consolidation of democracy and regional </p><p>integration (Guatemala); and Promotion of investment in </p><p>Central America and the development of infrastructure </p><p>(Honduras). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  While deeply appreciative of the opportunity to meet </p><p>with President Bush given the ongoing war, Maduro suggested </p><p>that, in his view, the Central American Free Trade Agreement </p><p>(CAFTA) is only part of the process needed to turn the region </p><p>as a whole "into a success story" and that the presidents </p><p>wanted to make the most out of this meeting with the </p><p>President to advance the U.S.-Central American agenda.   He </p><p>stated that the Central Americans wanted to point out the key </p><p>areas that had to be addressed in the region in order to </p><p>promote needed political and economic integration for </p><p>long-term economic growth and poverty reduction. Ambassador </p><p>reminded Maduro that in this instance, given the short amount </p><p>of time available before the meeting, that remarks should be </p><p>concise, focused, and limited to CAFTA. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Maduro Supportive on Iraq </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Ambassador acknowledged President Maduro\'s supportive </p><p>stance on Iraq and for Honduras joining the coalition.  He </p><p>noted the Government of Honduras\' (GOH) support underscored </p><p>the strong relationship between the two countries and that </p><p>Washington was appreciative.  Ambassador also told Maduro </p><p>that Washington was interested in pursuing his offer of </p><p>troops to assist in post-conflict Iraq and encouraged Maduro </p><p>to make a formal offer in writing to the USG so our </p><p>military-to-military planning could move forward.  However, </p><p>Ambassador called attention to USG disappointment with the </p><p>luke-warm statement delivered by Ambassador Manuel Acosta </p><p>Bonilla, the Honduran Permanent Representative to the United </p><p>Nations, during the March 26 Security Council open session on </p><p>Iraq.  Ambassador urged Maduro and the GOH to play a more </p><p>active public role in support of the coalition\'s goals. </p><p>Maduro reaffirmed Honduras\' support for the coalition and was </p><p>apologetic regarding the statement by Acosta Bonilla.  He </p><p>acknowledged that the remarks were insufficient and that they </p><p>did not reflect the solid support Honduras has for the </p><p>coalition\'s goals.  He went so far as to suggest that he </p><p>would tell the Foreign Minister to remove Bonilla if his </p><p>performance at the UN did not improve.  (COMMENT:  Only the </p><p>President has the legal authority to remove a standing </p><p>ambassador and Maduro is probably aware of this.  In </p><p>addition, given Bonilla\'s status as one of the Nationalist </p><p>Party\'s senior statesmen, only Maduro himself would be able </p><p>to dismiss him.  More than likely Maduro\'s statement was </p><p>intended to deflect criticism of his administration\'s </p><p>relatively meek public support of the coalition\'s efforts to </p><p>date. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>ICC Article 98 Agreement and Counterterrorism Conventions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Ambassador reiterated the necessity of Honduran </p><p>ratification of the International Criminal Court (ICC) </p><p>Article 98 Agreement and expressed hope the agreement could </p><p>be sent to Congress for action as soon as possible. </p><p>Ambassador also provided President Maduro with a list of five </p><p>outstanding UN and two OAS counterterrorism </p><p>conventions/protocols that the USG would like Honduras to </p><p>sign and/or ratify as soon as possible (ref C).  Maduro did </p><p>not seem fully informed on this subject, confusing the </p><p>Article 98 Agreement with the outstanding counterterrorism </p><p>conventions.  Maduro said he would pass the list to the MFA </p><p>(which Post confirmed he did) but he did not offer any </p><p>time-frame for movement on either the ICC agreement or the </p><p>outstanding counterterrorism conventions/protocols. </p><p>(COMMENT:  The GOH is unlikely to forward the Article 98 </p><p>Agreement, or seek congressional action on it, until after it </p><p>secures congressional authorization for the deployment of </p><p>Honduran troops to Iraq. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>AMB Urges Continued Delay on Honduran Ambassador to Cuba </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Ambassador called Maduro\'s attention to the fact that </p><p>Fidel Castro was taking advantage of the conflict in the </p><p>Middle East to crack down on human rights/pro-democracy </p><p>activists in Cuba (ref A).  He directly asked Maduro to </p><p>further delay the appointment of a Honduran ambassador to </p><p>Cuba.  If an appointment is forthcoming in the future, </p><p>Ambassador reminded Maduro that the GOH had agreed to consult </p><p>Post prior to any type of announcement.  Maduro acknowledged </p><p>that he is not very comfortable with Cuba or the Cuban </p><p>doctors in Honduras, referring to concerns that the Cuban </p><p>doctors practice "more than medicine."  However, Maduro once </p><p>again repeated that his administration was not responsible </p><p>for the opening to Cuba and that he had inherited the </p><p>situation from his predecessor.  He promised to keep USG </p><p>concerns in mind in any dealings with Cuba. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Disappointing Results on Honduran Counternarcotics Efforts </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) The Ambassador underscored USG disappointment over the </p><p>lack of effective Honduran interdiction efforts against the </p><p>large amount of illegal narcotics that transit Honduras </p><p>annually.  He pointed out that drug seizures in Honduras are </p><p>at a three-year low.   Ambassador spelled out how corruption </p><p>within the Honduran military and police is undermining law </p><p>enforcement efforts.  He explained that whenever the USG </p><p>passes counternarcotics information to GOH sources it is </p><p>invariably leaked to the traffickers.  Maduro expressed </p><p>dismay and asked if the USG knew who was responsible. </p><p>Ambassador told Maduro the USG was investigating but to date </p><p>had no firm suspects.  However, when the culprits are </p><p>discovered, Ambassador insisted that they be "summarily </p><p>dismissed."  Maduro promised full support on the issue but </p><p>also cited a lack of resources as a major impediment to GOH </p><p>efforts to improve counternarcotics results. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Maduro Very Concerned Over Continued Doctors\' Strike </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Maduro then raised his deep concern over the </p><p>continued doctors\' strike which began in Tegucigalpa March 18 </p><p>and spread nationwide March 24, raising his fears that it </p><p>could cause general instability and that the doctors may try </p><p>to take over hospitals as had been done in the past.  He said </p><p>he was considering dispatching police units to the hospitals </p><p>to prevent this from occurring and that he might be forced to </p><p>declare a "state of emergency," if the situation deteriorated </p><p>further.  (NOTE:  Maduro was scheduled to meet with his </p><p>cabinet later that same day regarding the strike.  Since this </p><p>meeting, the doctors have suspended their strike and have met </p><p>with the GOH to discuss their differences.  The GOH has </p><p>agreed not to fire any of the doctors that were on strike for </p><p>the time being.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Negotiations are ongoing. While the proximate cause </p><p>of the strike was a dispute with the Minister of Health Elias </p><p>Lizardi over appointments of doctors in public hospitals, the </p><p>deeper issue is the impending revision of a law which </p><p>guarantees that the basic doctor\'s salary is 14 times the </p><p>minimum wage which leads to relatively exorbitant salaries </p><p>compared with other public sector employees.  Doctors earn </p><p>anywhere from USD 14,000 - 50,000 a year from just one public </p><p>salary, and many hold two government jobs or have a private </p><p>practice which greatly increases their income.  The </p><p>government must reduce its public wage bill in order to reach </p><p>an agreement with the IMF.  (See para 12 for additional </p><p>detail on IMF negotiations.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Increased Foreign Direct Investment and an IMF Package </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Maduro highlighted that increasing foreign direct </p><p>investment (FDI) remains a high priority for his </p><p>administration.  Maduro referred to a conversation he had </p><p>with Ian Walker (a British economic consultant on the Casa </p><p>Presidencial payroll) who claimed that Honduras would need to </p><p>attract between USD 2.5 to 3 billion annually in order to </p><p>increase GDP by two percent.  Maduro said he was considering </p><p>tax credits, tax forgiveness, duty free status, and other </p><p>measures to accomplish this goal.  Maduro expressed optimism </p><p>that with increased FDI, GDP could rise to the level of </p><p>between five and six percent annually.  Ambassador </p><p>complimented Maduro on his desire to attract increased FDI, </p><p>but noted that the main obstacle to accomplishing this goal </p><p>is deeper reform of the dysfunctional judicial system. </p><p>Ambassador added that "the lack of judicial security," is the </p><p>most serious concern for any prospective investor. </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) During the conversation on FDI Maduro segued into his </p><p>desire to complete an IMF agreement as soon as possible (ref </p><p>B).  Maduro stressed that his administration had been making </p><p>real progress on constraining the budget deficit and that the </p><p>IMF should take that into account.  He also stated he thought </p><p>the IMF was being too dogmatic on the civil service salary </p><p>issue.  The possible revision of laws guaranteeing doctors </p><p>and teachers salaries in multiples of the minimum wage, </p><p>meaning that every raise in the minimum wage leads to large </p><p>raises for doctors and teachers, is a hot button political </p><p>issue.  (COMMENT:  Interestingly, Maduro refrained from </p><p>asking for any type of USG assistance to move the IMF process </p><p>forward.  It appears that he understands the parameters of </p><p>what the USG is willing to do with the IMF. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
