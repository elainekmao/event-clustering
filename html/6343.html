<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001053 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EU, MARR, MK, PREL, NATO, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI PUSHES STRONGLY FOR EU ASSUMPTION OF ALLIED </p><p>HARMONY </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 931 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM E. SKODON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01053  132008Z </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  IN A MEETING BETWEEN DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>GIANCARLO ARAGONA AND THE DCM, ARAGONA QUESTIONED CONTINUED </p><p>DELAYS IN THE EU\'S ASSUMPTION OF OPERATION ALLIED HARMONY </p><p>FROM NATO AND MINIMIZED THE WORK NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE </p><p>BERLIN PLUS PROCESS.  DCM MADE CLEAR THE U.S. HAS NO </p><p>OBJECTION TO THE EU ROLE BUT REITERATED THE NEED TO FINISH </p><p>BERLIN PLUS BEFORE THE HANDOVER OCCURS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON MARCH 11, THE DCM, POLMIN, AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER) </p><p>MET WITH DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR THE MFA\'S BUREAU FOR </p><p>MULTILATERAL POLITICAL AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, GIANCARLO </p><p>ARAGONA, TO DISCUSS A VARIETY OF ISSUES.  RETURNING TO THE </p><p>SAME TOPIC HIS DEPUTY RAISED IN A MEETING MARCH 5 (REF A), </p><p>ARAGONA ASKED THE DCM WHY THE US CONTINUED TO BLOCK THE </p><p>TRANSFER OF OPERATION ALLIED HARMONY IN MACEDONIA FROM NATO </p><p>TO THE EU.  ACCORDING TO ARAGONA, ONLY INSIGNIFICANT </p><p>TECHNICAL DETAILS, MINUTIAE REALLY, REMAINED TO BE WORKED OUT </p><p>WITHIN THE BERLIN PLUS DISCUSSIONS.  DCM INFORMED ARAGONA THE </p><p>U.S HAD NO OBJECTIONS IN PRINCIPLE TO TURNING OVER THE </p><p>OPERATION, AND IN FACT WANTED IT TO SUCCEED.  HOWEVER, HE </p><p>NOTED A CLEAR DIFFERENCE IN PERCEPTION ON THE ISSUE.  THE </p><p>REMAINING BERLIN PLUS DETAILS WERE NOT, IN THE EYES OF </p><p>WASHINGTON, MINUTIAE, BUT RATHER CRITICAL TO TRANSPARENTLY </p><p>SETTING OUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EU AND NATO. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ARAGONA WARNED AGAINST "PLAYING" TOO MUCH WITH NATO, </p><p>STATING THAT WITH THE EASTERN THREAT GONE THE ALLIANCE WAS </p><p>FRAGILE AND COULD EASILY SUFFER.  AS A STEADFAST ALLY, HE </p><p>REQUESTED WE ASK WASHINGTON TO "COOL DOWN" AT NATO.  IF IN </p><p>FACT THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS CONCLUSION OF BERLIN PLUS, THEN THE </p><p>USG SHOULD NOT HAVE CITED OTHER FACTORS AS OBSTACLES TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01053  132008Z </p><p>HANDING OVER THE MISSION.  THE DG ADMITTED EU\'S EMPHASIS ON </p><p>TAKING OVER BOSNIA HAD PERHAPS BEEN TOO RASH, AND STATED IT </p><p>COULD BE DECIDED LATER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ARAGONA AGREED TO OUR SUGGESTION THAT ALL PARTIES </p><p>SHOULD PRESS FOR CLOSURE OF RESIDUAL ISSUES TO COMPLETE </p><p>BERLIN PLUS.  HE ALSO MENTIONED SOME UNHAPPINESS WITH NATO </p><p>MILITARY STAFF DOCUMENTS STATING THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>MACEDONIA WERE UNINTERESTED IN AN EU PRESENCE, QUESTIONING </p><p>THE STRENGTH OF THE EU, AND BELITTLING EUROPEAN MILITARY </p><p>PROWESS.  SUCH STATEMENTS CAUSE BOTH EUROPEAN AND ITALIAN </p><p>UNEASE.  HE FINISHED BY NOTING THAT PM BERLUSCONI WANTS TO </p><p>SEE ESDP APPLIED ON THE GROUND. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) DCM STATED THAT KEEPING NATO STRONG WAS A SHARED </p><p>INTEREST.  THE NUB OF THE MACEDONIA PROBLEM WAS FINISHING THE </p><p>BERLIN PLUS PROCESS SO THE EU/NATO WORKING RELATIONSHIP IS </p><p>CLEAR, ACCEPTED, AND KNOWN TO THE PARTIES. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01053 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
