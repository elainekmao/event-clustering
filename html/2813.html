<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000974 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR SWANN, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI </p><p>FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT KUDOS TO AFRICA; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Don\'t abuse UN" the </p><p>   government-controlled weekly "The Sunday News" </p><p>   dedicated its April 21 editorial to hailing African </p><p>   countries for blocking a call for an investigation </p><p>   into alleged human rights violations in Zimbabwe </p><p>   during a United Nations human rights forum in </p><p>   Geneva, Switzerland last week.  The same editorial </p><p>   also characterized the U.S. human rights record as </p><p>   "deplorable."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Human rights are not white man\'s preserve.  This </p><p>   is the strong message that came across on Friday when </p><p>   the United Nations Human Rights Commission humiliated </p><p>   Britain and the European Union (EU).  The EU concocted </p><p>   ridiculous allegations against Zimbabwe, claiming that </p><p>   the government has grossly violated human rights in </p><p>   the country and should be investigated by UN experts. </p><p>   But in an extraordinary feat of diplomacy, Nigeria led </p><p>   African, Asian and Middle Eastern countries in the 53- </p><p>   member Commission to successfully oppose the EU\'s </p><p>   mischievous campaign. </p><p> </p><p>   "The West\'s own human rights record is deplorable. </p><p>   America has a deplorable record in Angola. . .Iraq, </p><p>   Afghanistan and Latin America.  A few years ago, </p><p>   the U.S. military bombed a pharmaceutical factory </p><p>   in Sudan after making unfounded allegations that it </p><p>   was a chemical weapons plant.  Although there is </p><p>   overwhelming evidence that Washington was wrong. . </p><p>   .no apologies have been forthcoming.  Surely, this </p><p>   makes the U.S. a rogue state.  Western countries </p><p>   are not qualified to lecture developing countries </p><p>   like Zimbabwe on so-called human rights.  With this </p><p>   crucial diplomatic victory developing countries </p><p>   have reminded the West that political bullying of </p><p>   the colonial type is unacceptable." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
