<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0401 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>NOVEMBER 25, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for November 25, 2002.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  VILLAGE RETURN FIGURES </p><p>(Radikal)  Official figures say 380,000 people </p><p>migrated from Southeastern villages beginning in </p><p>1991, when clashes intensified and when village </p><p>evacuations and burnings became a common </p><p>practice, due to alleged logistical support to </p><p>the PKK.  According to human rights </p><p>organizations, as many as three million people </p><p>may have migrated from their villages, with over </p><p>4,000 villages emptied.  Villagers who agreed to </p><p>become village guards were allowed to stay in </p><p>their villages.  According to the Interior </p><p>Ministry, 51,152 evacuees have returned to 9,082 </p><p>homes in eleven State of Emergency (OHAL) and </p><p>adjacent provinces over the past two years under </p><p>the Village Return Project.  However, in a recent </p><p>Istanbul meeting, Human Rights Watch Turkey </p><p>Officer Jonathan Sugden indicated the project was </p><p>far from solving evacuees\' problems.  Attorneys </p><p>from the Working Group formed by the Diyarbakir </p><p>Bar Association petitioned the administrative </p><p>courts in provinces where evacuees faced </p><p>difficulties, to initiate prosecution (against </p><p>local authorities), claiming evacuees\' property </p><p>rights were ignored. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  MOBILE COMMAND VEHICLE </p><p>(Turkiye)  The Health Ministry sent a TL 156 </p><p>billion (approx. USD 100,000) Mobile Command </p><p>Vehicle to the Diyarbakir Health Directorate to </p><p>be used under war conditions.  Increased </p><p>activities continue in Diyarbakir due to the </p><p>possible U.S. operation against Iraq.  The </p><p>vehicle, which includes a digital camera system, </p><p>30,000-kilometer wireless system, automatic </p><p>satellite antenna and telephones, will be sent to </p><p>the border during such an operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  ANTI-YOK AND ANTI-U.S. PROTESTS </p><p>(Evrensel)  A group called "the Gaziantep </p><p>University Democrat Students" held a press </p><p>conference during which they protested the Higher </p><p>Education Council (YOK) and the U.S.  Several </p><p>labor unions and political parties supported the </p><p>protest.  The protest ended after the group </p><p>shouted such slogans as "No to YOK and war," "We </p><p>want a budget for education, not war" and "We </p><p>want mother-tongue education." </p><p>Similar demonstrations were held by the Adana and </p><p>Tunceli chapters of the Teachers Union Egitim-Sen </p><p>to protest pressures and exiles facing teachers, </p><p>war and the IMF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  CONTINUED PRO-OCALAN PROTESTS </p><p>(Evrensel)  Hundreds of Siirt youths staged a </p><p>demonstration to Protest PKK leader Abdullah </p><p>Ocalan\'s isolation by pouring gasoline and </p><p>burning streets, closing roads to traffic, and </p><p>shouting pro-Ocalan slogans.  Following the </p><p>demonstration, police took tight security </p><p>measures.  In Bostanici (Van), a group of youths </p><p>staged a demonstration to mark the anniversary of </p><p>the founding of the PKK.  They marched, shouting </p><p>the "Freedom to Ocalan" slogan.  They then </p><p>dispersed when police arrived. </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  BUSINESS WORLD OPTIMISTIC ABOUT GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROGRAM </p><p>(Dunya)  Business leaders, including Gaziantep </p><p>Organized Industrial Zone President Akif Ekici, </p><p>Gaziantep Commodity Exchange President Omer </p><p>Celik, Southeastern Anatolia Exporters\' Union </p><p>President Abdulkadir Cikmaz, Gaziantep Young </p><p>Businessmen\'s Association (GAGIAD) board member </p><p>Turgut Ercan, Gaziantep Free Zone Corporation </p><p>President Mehmet Ozmen and Mersin Chamber of </p><p>Commerce and Industry President Kadri Saman, </p><p>reacted positively to the new government\'s </p><p>program announced at the Parliament. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
