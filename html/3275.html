END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) MISOFF ATTENDED A MEETING JULY 5 HOSTED BY THE </p><p>CURRENT EU PRESIDENT, DENMARK, TO DISCUSS A STRATEGY FOR </p><p>REINSTATING DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG) TERM LIMITS AT THE UN FOOD </p><p>AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO).  SPAIN, FRANCE, PORTUGAL </p><p>(CURRENT CHAIR OF THE FAO EUROPEAN REGIONAL GROUP), CANADA, </p><p>AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND (REPRESENTING THE FAO\'S SOUTHWEST </p><p>PACIFIC GROUP) AND JAPAN ALSO ATTENDED.  DANISH MINISTER </p><p>COUNSELLOR JORGEN PEDERSON REPORTED THAT TERM LIMITS HAS </p><p>BEEN AGREED EU POLICY SINCE 1998, BUT THAT DENMARK WAS GIVEN </p><p>A MANDATE LAST DECEMBER TO TAKE IT UP IN ROME AFTER THE </p><p>WORLD FOOD SUMMIT:FIVE YEARS LATER MEETING (WFS5YL). </p><p> </p><p>PROPOSED EU STRATEGY </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) JORGEN OUTLINED THE FOLLOWING PROPOSED STRATEGY: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE EU PRESIDENCY WILL HOLD MEETINGS WITH ALL REGIONAL </p><p>GROUPS BEFORE AUGUST, CIRCULATING IN ADVANCE OF THE MEETINGS </p><p>A "SPEAKING NOTE" (FAXED TO IO/EDA SURA JOHNSON 7/8/02) </p><p>WHICH EXPLAINS THE RATIONALE FOR SEEKING TERM LIMITS. </p><p> </p><p>-- (END OF SEPTEMBER) AN EU-DRAFTED REQUEST TO THE FAO TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03357  01 OF 02  110811Z </p><p>ADD THE AGENDA ITEM TO THE OCTOBER COUNCIL SESSION GOES </p><p>FORWARD.  IDEALLY THE REQUEST WOULD BE SIGNED BY CHAIRS OF </p><p>ALL REGIONAL GROUPS; ABSENT THIS, THE REQUEST SHOULD HAVE A </p><p>LARGE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES FROM MANY REGIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- (OCTOBER 2002) THE FAO COUNCIL (OCTOBER 28-NOV 2) AGREES </p><p>TO ADOPT THE AGENDA WITH THE ADDITIONAL ITEM (MAJORITY VOTE, </p><p>IF A VOTE IS TAKEN).  (NOTE:  THIS IS WHERE THE TERM LIMITS </p><p>MOVEMENT CAME TO AN INGLORIOUS END IN 1999 WHEN THE COUNCIL </p><p>VOTED DOWN THE PROPOSAL TO ADD THE ITEM TO THE AGENDA). </p><p> </p><p>-- THE COUNCIL DEBATES THE SUBJECT (PROBABLY WITHOUT </p><p>CONCLUSION) AND AGREES TO SEND IT FORWARD TO THE JUNE 23-28, </p><p>2003 COUNCIL SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>-- (JUNE 2003) THE 124TH COUNCIL SESSION AGREES ON CHANGES </p><p>TO THE FAO BASIC TEXTS TO REINSTATE TERM LIMITS AND SENDS </p><p>THE PROPOSAL TO THE FAO CONFERENCE (NOVEMBER 26-28, 2003) </p><p>FOR ADOPTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- (NOVEMBER 2003) THE CONFERENCE ADOPTS THE PROPOSALS. </p><p>(ALL PROPOSALS TO CHANGE BASIC TEXTS MUST BE ADOPTED BY 2/3 </p><p>VOTE). </p><p> </p><p>WHAT KIND OF "TERM LIMITS" </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SUB) UNGA RESOLUTION 51/241 (ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY) </p><p>AFFIRMS THAT "UNIFORM TERMS OF FOUR YEARS, RENEWABLE ONCE" </p><p>SHOULD BE INTRODUCED FOR UN PROGRAMS FUNDS AND OTHER ECOSOC </p><p>BODIES.  THE SPECIALIZED AGENCIES ARE ALSO "ENCOURAGED" TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03357  01 OF 02  110811Z </p><p>CONSIDER UNIFORM TERMS AND TERM LIMITS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) ON THIS BASIS, PEDERSON ARGUED THAT - IDEALLY - </p><p>THE TERM LIMITS CAMPAIGN WOULD SEEK TO AMEND THE FAO BASIC </p><p>TEXTS TO ALLOW FOR TWO FOUR-YEAR TERMS. (THE CURRENT TERM </p><p>LENGTH IS SIX YEARS).  NONETHELESS, BEARING IN MIND THAT THE </p><p>MOST IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE WAS TO LIMIT THE TERMS (WHATEVER </p><p>LENGTH), THE EU WAS WILLING TO DISCUSS 4 OR 6 YEAR TERMS </p><p>(FIVE YEARS IS PROBABLY NOT AN OPTION AS THE FAO CONFERENCE </p><p>CYCLE -- WHERE ELECTIONS ARE HELD -- IS EVERY TWO YEARS). </p><p>OTHER MEETING PARTICIPANTS DID NOT HAVE SPECIFIC </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS ON THE LENGTH OF TERM AND AGREED THAT THE VIEWS </p><p>OF OTHER REGIONAL GROUPS SHOULD BE HEARD ON THE SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF "GRANDFATHERING" THE </p><p>CURRENT DG (I.E. TO EXEMPT HIM FROM TERM LIMITS ALL </p><p>TOGETHER).  IT WAS NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT IF A FOUR-YEAR TERM </p><p>WERE TO BE APPROVED, THE DG WOULD MOST LIKELY BE ENTITLED TO </p><p>STAY UNTIL THE END OF HIS SIX-YEAR TERM IN 2005. </p><p> </p><p>VIEWS OF REGIONAL GROUPS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1770 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03357  02 OF 02  110813Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   EUR-00   UTED-00  FDRE-01  TEDE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   TEST-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------C99589  110813Z /75 </p><p>R 091156Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 4705 </p><p>INFO USDA FAS WASHDC 2212 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2730 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 003357 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA SURA JOHNSON </p><p>USDA/FAS LYNN REICH, DICK HUGHES </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, FAO, KUNR </p><p>SUBJECT:  EU TAKES ON TERM LIMITS FOR FAO </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03357  02 OF 02  110813Z </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) FODAG MISOFF, CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND </p><p>ALL STATED THAT SEEKING A TWO TERM-LIMIT WAS ALREADY AN </p><p>AGREED GENEVA GROUP POSITION AND THAT THE ISSUE MUST BE </p><p>PURSUED NOW IN ORDER TO BE APPROVED AT THE 2003 CONFERENCE. </p><p>(LEAVING THE ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED AT THE 2005 CONFERENCE </p><p>WOULD PUT THE REFORM EFFORT IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH A </p><p>(POSSIBLE) RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN BY THE CURRENT DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL).  AS STATED IN PARA FOUR, MEETING PARTICIPANTS DID </p><p>NOT HAVE A POSITION ON TERM LENGTH, BUT AGREED TO SEEK </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS.  NEW ZEALAND RECALLED THAT A SIMILAR EFFORT AT </p><p>UNESCO HAD TAKEN 18 MONTHS AND EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>STICKING TO THE COURSE ONCE THE DECISION HAD BEEN TAKEN TO </p><p>MOVE FORWARD ON TERM LIMITS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) IT WAS NOTED THAT MOST MEMBERS OF THE FAO\'S LATIN </p><p>AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN GROUP (GRULAC)SUPPORTED TERM LIMITS. </p><p>(COMMENT: WHILE THERE IS NO FORMAL SYSTEM OF ROTATION AT THE </p><p>FAO, THE GRULAC HAS NEVER HAD A DIRECTOR GENERAL AND </p><p>BELIEVES THAT IT IS THEIR TURN.  END COMMENT.) INDIVIDUAL </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE AFRICAN AND ASIAN GROUPS HAD BEEN HEARD TO </p><p>EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE CONCEPT OF TERM LIMITS BUT THE </p><p>STRENGTH OF THIS POSITION THROUGHOUT THE GROUP NEEDS TO BE </p><p>DISCUSSED AND EXPLORED. </p><p> </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) IT WAS AGREED THAT DENMARK WOULD REPORT BACK ON </p><p>ITS MEETINGS WITH THE OTHER REGIONAL GROUPS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03357  02 OF 02  110813Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) MEETING PARTICIPANTS ALSO DISCUSSED WAYS TO </p><p>INVOLVE  AMBASSADOR MEKOUR (MOROCCO), THE FAO INDEPENDENT </p><p>CHAIR OF COUNCIL, NOTING THAT HAVING MEKOUR ON BOARD WAS </p><p>IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE REFORM EFFORT. (COMMENT: </p><p>SINCE MEKOUR IS NOW STATIONED IN WASHINGTON, THIS POSES </p><p>LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS.  WHETHER MEKOUR WILL SUPPORT THE REFORM </p><p>EFFORT IS ALSO NOT KNOWN.  END COMMENT).  AS A (LESS </p><p>SATISFACTORY) FALLBACK, MEETING PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED </p><p>EMBARKING ON INFORMAL, INTER-REGIONAL LUNCHES TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>MATTER WITH OTHER ROME COLLEAGUES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) MISOFF PROPOSED, AND OTHER MEMBERS AGREED THAT A </p><p>DEMARCHE IN CAPITALS (POSSIBLY A JOINT DEMARCHE) TO COUNCIL </p><p>MEMBERS ON THE QUESTION OF PUTTING THE ITEM ON THE FAO </p><p>COUNCIL AGENDA WOULD BE STRONGLY ADVISED.  THIS SHOULD BE </p><p>TAKEN UP IN EARLY SEPTEMBER AFTER THE MEETINGS WITH THE </p><p>REGIONAL GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>WHO WILL BELL THE CAT? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) PEDERSON REPORTED THAT THE MATTER HAD NOT YET </p><p>BEEN RAISED WITH DIOUF (AS THEY DID NOT WANT HIM TO USE THE </p><p>WFS5YL TO LOBBY AGAINST THE IDEA).  IT WAS NOTED THAT, WHEN </p><p>THE ISSUE HAD BEEN RAISED IN THE PAST, DIOUF\'S RESPONSE WAS </p><p>INEVITABLY "IT\'S UP TO MEMBERSHIP" -- DESPITE THE FACT THAT </p><p>HE VERY MUCH MADE IT HIS BUSINESS TO DEFEAT THE 1999 EFFORT </p><p>TO ADD TERM LIMITS TO THE FAO COUNCIL AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03357  02 OF 02  110813Z </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>11. (SBU) THE EU INITIATIVE BROADENS AND STRENGTHENS AN </p><p>EXISTING GENEVA GROUP DECISION THAT THE TERM LIMITS SHOULD </p><p>BE SOUGHT, AND THAT THE PROCESS NEEDED TO START IN 2002 IN </p><p>ORDER TO AVOID CONFLICT WITH THE NEXT ELECTION (IN 2005). </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) AMONG OTHER "REFORM-MINDED" DELEGATES, FOUR YEARS </p><p>IS THE STARTING OUT POSITION, BUT THERE IS PROBABLY SOME </p><p>NEGOTIATING FLEXIBILITY ON THE ISSUE.
