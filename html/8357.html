<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003509 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: CHP TAKES A TACTICAL VIEW OF REFORM </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by PolCouns John Kunstadter.  Reason: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Opposition CHP has publicly, and privately in </p><p>meetings with us, endorsed the AK government\'s EU reform </p><p>package but has rejected AK proposals to sell state-owned </p><p>forestry lands and to allow local administrations more </p><p>control over health and education services.  The CHP stance </p><p>reflects in large part a tactical political interest in </p><p>weakening AK in the months leading up to the next nation-wide </p><p>local elections.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Principled Opposition? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CHP officials at all levels have spoken publicly in </p><p>favor of AK\'s efforts to push through an ambitious sixth EU </p><p>reform package.  Senior CHP M.P. Bulent Tanla recently </p><p>confirmed to us privately that CHP will support the AK </p><p>package unconditionally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) However, on other key reform proposals, including some </p><p>that are crucial to promoting better governance and </p><p>democratization, CHP has balked for tactical political </p><p>reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In recent meetings, senior CHP deputies have argued </p><p>with limited conviction that AK\'s proposals to decentralize </p><p>the Turkish state system by giving more power to elected </p><p>local authorities, and to sell lands still classified as </p><p>forest although have since developed without title, are </p><p>deeply flawed.  These measures require constitutional </p><p>amendments.  In separate meetings recently, the CHP M.P.s -- </p><p>High Administrative Board members Hakki Akalin and Fuat Cay </p><p>and senior party economist Kemal Kilicdaroglu -- alleged that </p><p>AK is trying to engineer these proposals only to benefit AK </p><p>supporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On local administrative reform, both Akalin and Cay argued </p><p>that CHP opposes AK\'s proposals on the grounds that the GOT </p><p>should first tackle parliamentary immunity -- a major CHP </p><p>campaign theme in the Nov. 2002 elections.  Akalin and Cay </p><p>admitted that local reform figures prominently in CHP\'s </p><p>election program, yet Akalin weakly dismissed AK\'s efforts, </p><p>saying, "You need to read the proposed legislation for </p><p>yourself to understand our objections." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Kemal Kilicdaroglu May 27 offered a more typically Statist </p><p>(and tenuous) criticism of AK\'s proposed legislation. </p><p>Kilicdaroglu explained that AK\'s proposal will give "too much </p><p>power" to the mayors of large towns.  This would only foster </p><p>open disagreement between the elected mayors and governors, </p><p>who are assigned by the State.  Kilicdaroglu also alleged </p><p>that smaller provinces will have a hard time collecting </p><p>enough revenue to support themselves, while larger provinces </p><p>like Istanbul will have more than enough funds.  When asked </p><p>if there were other means available to address the potential </p><p>imbalance while promoting local control, he demurred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Akalin claimed that some forestry land in Istanbul </p><p>province is clearly being earmarked for an unnamed AK </p><p>supporter.  Cay averred that AK "has no clear plan as to what </p><p>will be done with the land after it is sold."  However, both </p><p>sheepishly acknowledged once again that selling the same land </p><p>parcels is part of CHP\'s own party program.  Moreover, </p><p>neither could articulate an alternative to AK\'s proposals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Baykal\'s Permanent Campaign </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Some CHP contacts acknowledge to us privately that </p><p>party leader Baykal is pursuing this strategy not for any </p><p>principled reason but simply to exploit divisions within AK\'s </p><p>parliamentary group and use it as a platform to hammer AK on </p><p>the parliamentary immunity issue.  Former CHP M.P. Erol </p><p>Cevikce -- once very close to Baykal -- explained to us May </p><p>16 that the CHP leader believes ultimately AK will split: "in </p><p>fact, he\'s counting on it."  CHP\'s current opposition to some </p><p>of AK\'s reform efforts, Cevikce noted, is due in part to </p><p>CHP\'s inability to garner more public support as a result of </p><p>its anti-war, anti-USG policy in the run-up to Operation </p><p>Iraqi Freedom. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Cevikce added that everything CHP is doing right now </p><p>is meant to increase CHP\'s chances in the local elections, </p><p>which must be held by April 2004 but which AK could advance </p><p>to autumn 2003.  Success in the local elections would help </p><p>position Baykal and CHP for the next national elections and </p><p>another shot at the prime ministership.  "Baykal has seen the </p><p>likes of Yilmaz, Ciller and even Erbakan become Prime </p><p>Minister," he said, "so why not him?"  Former CHP deputy </p><p>Sabri Ergul subsequently echoed Cevikce\'s comments, noting </p><p>that Baykal sees local elections as a big test to determine </p><p>whether he has solidified his place as CHP leader -- and as a </p><p>national leader.  Ergul averred that CHP will choose local </p><p>candidates who have the best chance of winning regardless of </p><p>political background -- a strategy subsequently confirmed by </p><p>Kilicdaroglu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Politics as Usual </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Many in CHP genuinely recognize the need for reform </p><p>along EU lines, especially given overwhelming public support </p><p>for change -- although it is worth keeping mind that as the </p><p>Party of Ataturk, CHP has traditionally indexed its policy to </p><p>the Establishment view.  On other essential reforms, however, </p><p>CHP\'s stance is that generally adopted by Turkish opposition </p><p>parties -- to reject whatever the government puts forward. </p><p>As such, it\'s not surprising that our CHP interlocutors </p><p>cannot elucidate alternatives to AK policies, and instead </p><p>fall back on the shop-worn Turkish political truism we hear </p><p>routinely from M.P.s and others: "we\'re in the opposition; </p><p>what do you expect?"  In this context, the idea that Baykal </p><p>and his cronies are acting less out of principle and more for </p><p>tactical reasons conforms to well set patterns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) From CHP\'s perspective, playing on AK\'s divisions </p><p>offers probably the only chance the party has to make inroads </p><p>in the local elections.  For example, CHP prospects in Ankara </p><p>revolve around whether the conservative vote will split </p><p>between current mayor Gokcek -- a former Refah and Fazilet </p><p>member who has had run-ins with P.M. Erdogan -- and a new AK </p><p>candidate.  (Note: there are signs Erdogan and Gokcek are </p><p>aware of this and are trying to mend fences.  End note.) </p><p>Likewise, CHP may be hoping that the most ardent opposition </p><p>to AK right now, Motorola deadbeat Cem Uzan\'s Genc Party, </p><p>will hive off a significant share of AK votes. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
