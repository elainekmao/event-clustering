<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000959 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: READOUT ON SOKOTO APPEALS COURT HEARING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1. (C) Summary: Media reports indicate that the Sokoto </p><p>Sharia appeals court on March 25 reversed a lower court </p><p>stoning sentence, clearing Safiya Husseini of all charges in </p><p>the case. During a March 22 conversation with PolCouns, Hauwa </p><p>Ibrahim, one of Husseini\'s attorneys, stated that the Sokoto </p><p>appellate court had listened intently to several defense </p><p>arguments, particularly the theory that the trial verdict was </p><p>improper because it was retroactive. Although the weight of </p><p>law favored Safiya, there was significant political pressure </p><p>on the judges to affirm the verdict. It remains to be seen </p><p>whether Sokoto State will let the matter rest or will appeal </p><p>in federal court. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>A FAIR HEARING </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) During a March 22 meeting with PolCouns, Ibrahim </p><p>capsulated the Sokoto Sharia Appeals Court proceedings in the </p><p>Safiya Husseini stoning case. During the hearings, the </p><p>defense team presented arguments along three lines: (a) </p><p>Constitutional Law, (b) Islamic Procedural Law; and (c) </p><p>Islamic Substantive Law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The constitutional points argued most strenuously </p><p>were that the sentence was retroactive and that Safiya was </p><p>not adequately informed of the charges against her. Section </p><p>36 (8) of the 1999 Constitution protects a person from </p><p>subsequently being criminally liable for an act that was not </p><p>a crime when committed. The same section also provides that a </p><p>criminal penalty cannot be harsher than the penalty in force </p><p>at the time the act was committed.  In Safiya\'s case, the </p><p>alleged adultery occurred before criminal Sharia was </p><p>established in Sokoto.  Thus, the Sharia code is </p><p>inapplicable, according to the defense\'s position. Instead of </p><p>applying Sharia proscriptions, the court must look to Sokoto </p><p>Criminal and Penal Codes then extant to determine whether a </p><p>crime occurred and, if so, the applicable punishment. </p><p>Ibrahim remarked that the judges spent more time on this </p><p>argument than any other during the hearings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The other constitutional ground vigorously argued </p><p>is Section 36 (6), which provides a defendant must be </p><p>apprised in a language he understands about criminal charges </p><p>against him.  Ibrahim explained the sentencing court did not </p><p>thoroughly explain the nature of the offense and punishment </p><p>to Husseini.  During his questioning of Husseini, the trial </p><p>judge also used Arabic words such as "zina" when describing </p><p>the crime of adultery.  Safiya is an uneducated rural woman </p><p>who knows no Arabic and thus did not understand the legal </p><p>implications of "zina" and other words, Ibrahim asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: The bench\'s focus on these arguments proved </p><p>to be a positive indication of how the judges were leaning. </p><p>By accepting these legal theories, the court could manage to </p><p>save Safiya yet sidestep the more nettlesome legal issues, </p><p>particularly the constitutional prohibition against cruel and </p><p>unusual punishment.  The argument that the sentence </p><p>constitutes cruel and unusual punishment was part of the </p><p>defense\'s formal brief; however, a tactical decision was </p><p>taken not to make it the cornerstone of their presentation to </p><p>this particular court.  The lawyers felt the argument would </p><p>engender little support and might produce animosity in a </p><p>Sharia court. End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Regarding Islamic procedural law, the trial erred by </p><p>not providing Safiya time to prepare nor was she given a real </p><p>opportunity to have counsel or examine witnesses, the defense </p><p>contended. Regarding Islamic substantive law, the purported </p><p>confession was not valid, Ibrahim asserted. The "confession" </p><p>was not a statement freely made by Safiya, but the melding of </p><p>answers to a battery of confusing, leading questions asked by </p><p>the trial judge. Also, the trial court did not allow Safiya </p><p>the opportunity to withdraw her "confession," a right </p><p>provided under Sharia law.  Ibrahim recalled that the lower </p><p>court transcript showed that the man Husseini said had </p><p>intercourse with her also admitted to intercourse but was </p><p>later absolved when he began obfuscating his replies to the </p><p>judge\'s questions. Ibrahim maintained that the court erred, </p><p>under Maliki jurisprudence, in considering pregnancy </p><p>conclusive proof of adultery. (Maliki is the prevailing </p><p>school of Islamic thought in Nigeria.) Under the Maliki </p><p>"hidden embryo" doctrine, a women can become pregnant five </p><p>years after a divorce yet the pregnancy still can be </p><p>attributed to the marriage, thus removing the stigma of </p><p>adultery. During the hearings, the defense team asserted a </p><p>finding of adultery required four independent witnesses who </p><p>viewed the same alleged act at the same time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Last, the defense argued that stoning was not mandated </p><p>by the Koran. Ibrahim said the court also focused heavily on </p><p>this aspect of the case, questioning both sides whether </p><p>stoning for adultery was based on the Koran and thus </p><p>mandatory, or Maliki hadith (traditions and custom) or fiqh. </p><p>If either of the latter two apply, the court could more </p><p>easily exercise its discretion to reverse the trial decision, </p><p>she claimed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Despite the judicial attention paid to key defense </p><p>arguments and the impartiality displayed during the hearing, </p><p>Ibrahim was unsure at the time of the conversation whether </p><p>the panel had been sufficiently swayed. She cited local </p><p>social and political pressure on the judges as the main </p><p>reason for her uncertainty. A Sokoto-based colleague </p><p>recounted to her a conversation with one of the judges who </p><p>complained about being drawn into a swell of controversy by </p><p>the case.  Stressing that Sharia was very popular in Sokoto, </p><p>she mentioned that comments from the gallery were </p><p>overwhelmingly for the sentence and not very complimentary </p><p>toward her and the other defense attorney\'s status who were </p><p>called impious Muslims. (Comment: Faced with the prospect of </p><p>social opprobrium and the potential of threats to their </p><p>personal safety, the judges could have easily ignored the </p><p>legal merits of the defense arguments and opted for the easy </p><p>way out. Apparently, the judges stuck to their consciences </p><p>and ignored the political flak swirling around them.  Quite </p><p>possibly, they might have received signals from key political </p><p>figures in Sokoto and beyond that this case had gone too far </p><p>in attracting the wrong type of publicity and that they </p><p>should take any avenue allowing them to reverse the sentence </p><p>without undermining Sharia.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Because they did not understand Sharia in its </p><p>totality, particularly those aspects dealing with social and </p><p>economic justice, outsiders seriously erred and </p><p>underestimated Sharia\'s popularity with the average </p><p>Northerner.  Sharia is more than imposing harsh criminal </p><p>punishments, maintained Ibrahim.  In fact, the central theme </p><p>underlying all the defense\'s arguments was that the stoning </p><p>sentence would not have occurred if Sharia\'s tenets had been </p><p>observed properly.  Under Sharia, a stoning sentence was </p><p>exceedingly rare. She hoped that outside commentary would be </p><p>kept to a minimum so that Nigeria\'s Muslims could "clean </p><p>their own house." However, critical statements from </p><p>foreigners and even non-Muslim Nigerians only inflamed and </p><p>blurred the issue, forcing people to choose between the </p><p>extremes of either being against Sharia or unquestioningly </p><p>supporting a political phenomenon its adherents had labelled </p><p>as Sharia.  For Nigerian Muslims, this was a Hobson\'s choice. </p><p>Wanting to be viewed as faithful, most people would choose </p><p>this politicized variant of Sharia, no matter how skewed it </p><p>might be. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Courtroom Theatrics Even In Sokoto </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) To comply with tradition in Sharia courts, the </p><p>defense team selected a Sokoto-based male attorney who was </p><p>versed in Arabic to act as lead counsel at trial although not </p><p>the most senior member of the defense team.  Despite this and </p><p>other defense attempts to maintain proper decorum, the </p><p>hearing on March 18 took on a carnival air.  When Safiya </p><p>entered the court, she was greeted like a "rock star." </p><p>First, the gallery fell silent.  Then there was a rush, as </p><p>people pushed to take photographs with her.  Even the </p><p>prosecuting attorneys joined the queue.  At one point, an </p><p>imposter claiming to be Safiya\'s attorney approached Ibrahim </p><p>soliciting funds for her purported client.  When Safiya </p><p>walked over and acknowledged Ibrahim, the huckster quickly </p><p>disappeared into the throng. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) While the reversal brings a sigh of relief,  there </p><p>are three similar stoning cases in Sokoto and another in </p><p>Katsina State. Unfortunately, some of the procedural errors </p><p>that helped win Safiya\'s reversal may not be present in the </p><p>other situations. Hard-line Sharia advocates who see the </p><p>Safiya reversal as a blow against Sharia will try to make </p><p>sure the sentences in the next cases are procedurally correct </p><p>and more immune from appellate reversal. Non-Muslims who see </p><p>the reversal as a mortal blow to criminal Sharia will be </p><p>mistaken.  As Ibrahim stated, Sharia is popular with many </p><p>Nigerian Muslims.  It is a social and political force that </p><p>cannot be disbanded by one adverse ruling in one state. Even </p><p>those politicians who exploited Sharia to bolster their </p><p>popularity cannot control it now.  Sharia is Northern </p><p>Nigerian populism, much to the chagrin of the region\'s </p><p>political elite who are accustomed to tight control of their </p><p>area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) As these other cases proceed, we will be faced with </p><p>the same human rights considerations regarding the imposition </p><p>of cruel and unusual punishment.  However, we must be careful </p><p>that our interests are not misconstrued as attacks against </p><p>Sharia or Islam.  Care should be taken to distinguish between </p><p>legitimate Sharia and the unfortunate verdicts sometimes </p><p>rendered by overzealous and untrained trial court judges. We </p><p>must maintain our stance in protection of human rights but </p><p>avoid sweeping statements about Sharia.  As the reversal </p><p>proves, while virtually all Muslims embrace Sharia, there are </p><p>vastly different views within Nigeria\'s Moslem community </p><p>about Sharia\'s procedural and substantive safeguards when it </p><p>comes to the criminally accused. By making sure our </p><p>statements and actions are well calibrated to promote human </p><p>rights but not to make Sharia seem valueless, we will help </p><p>people like Ibrahim and other moderates whose embrace of </p><p>Sharia also encompasses protection of fundamental human </p><p>rights. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
