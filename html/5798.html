<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000428 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E/0/ 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KCRM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: PRISON RIOT KILLS GERARDI MURDERER, SIX OTHERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 GUATEMALA 3281 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  Sergeant Jose Obdulio Villanueva, serving a </p><p>30-year sentence for the murder of Bishop Gerardi, was </p><p>decapitated along with three other inmates during a </p><p>prison riot on February 12.  The riot was an internal </p><p>power struggle between two groups of inmates.  The sixth </p><p>prison uprising in the past seven weeks, this one has </p><p>taken on added significance due to the presence of </p><p>several former military men involved in Guatemala\'s two </p><p>most prominent Human Rights murder cases.  Conspiracy </p><p>theories are running rampant due to Villanueva\'s key </p><p>role in the Gerardi murder coupled with the successful </p><p>evacuation of three military officers being held in </p><p>connection with the murder of Myrna Mack.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background to a riot </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. On December 23, 2002, the bloodiest prison riot in </p><p>recent Guatemalan history left 14 dead in the Pavoncito </p><p>Detention Center (reftel).  Although Pavoncito remains, </p><p>in large part, under the internal control of the </p><p>inmates, many gang members were transferred to the Zone </p><p>18 Detention Center.  Within three days of their </p><p>arrival, these inmates attempted an unsuccessful riot. </p><p>The Zone 18 Detention Center has been largely under the </p><p>control of inmates with military and police backgrounds, </p><p>led by Captain Lima who, like Villanueva, received a 30- </p><p>year sentence for his role in the Gerardi murder. </p><p>Lima\'s control, maintained through extortion and </p><p>violence, was challenged by the ex-mayor of Cuilapa, </p><p>Edwin Franco, an inmate with connections to organized </p><p>crime. </p><p> </p><p>What happened </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. In the early morning of February 12, just after </p><p>prisoners from cell block eight were released into to </p><p>the yard for routine exercise, inmates from the Franco </p><p>faction in blocks one and two either broke out or were </p><p>let out of their cells (there are conflicting official </p><p>reports as whether the cell doors were forced).  The </p><p>prisoners entered the empty block eight and proceeded to </p><p>break through the wall into block seven--exclusive </p><p>territory of the military inmates.  For about forty </p><p>minutes, the inmates in block seven managed to hold off </p><p>their attackers and at the same time to open another </p><p>hole in the opposite wall through which many escaped </p><p>into a patio area near the center entrance that was </p><p>under police custody.  By noon the worst was over and </p><p>some wounded inmates were transferred to San Juan de </p><p>Dios Hospital.  By 3:00 PM authorities were able to </p><p>remove visiting family members trapped by the violence </p><p>in the center.  At 9:00 PM authorities were able to </p><p>confiscate cell phones and numerous improvised weapons. </p><p>Full control has not been restored as a result of a 24- </p><p>hour ultimatum issued to prison authorities by Lima, </p><p>some 200 gang members were transferred back to </p><p>Pavoncito. </p><p> </p><p>The Mack Suspects </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Police removed the three military officers </p><p>implicated in the 1990 murder of anthropologist Myrna </p><p>Mack (General Edgar Godoy, Colonel Oliva, and Colonel </p><p>Valencia) from the detention center without incident. </p><p>The officers were taken to the military\'s Cuartel </p><p>General but, in a positive development, the Cuartel </p><p>Commander refused to take custody because the police did </p><p>not have a judicial order authorizing the transfer.  The </p><p>suspects were then taken to El Boqueron, a newly re- </p><p>opened maximum security facility in Santa Rosa </p><p>Department where they are currently the only inmates. </p><p>Note: Prison directors have authority to make transfers </p><p>without judicial orders under emergency circumstances, </p><p>even to military jails.  Human rights groups have been </p><p>concerned that these officers would easily escape if </p><p>transferred to a military prison.  In the 1990 murder of </p><p>American citizen Michael Devine, Captain Contreras </p><p>escaped within hours of being convicted and transferred </p><p>to a military prison.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Although Villanueva\'s violent execution was the </p><p>result of a riot sparked by an internal power struggle, </p><p>the persistence of the conspiracy theories and rumors </p><p>fueled by these latest prison riots are a fresh </p><p>indication of how little faith Guatemalans have in their </p><p>government.  The zone 18 riot harshly reminded the </p><p>public that official corruption threatens lives.  Over </p><p>the last several weeks, news of official corruption, </p><p>prison riots, and skyrocketing crime rates have been the </p><p>daily fare of all major news networks.  News of the </p><p>latest riot also reminded the public that their </p><p>government has not been able to reassert complete </p><p>control over the inmates in Pavoncito (where gang </p><p>members have just been reinserted).  Captain Lima\'s </p><p>successful ultimatum confirmed for most Guatemalans that </p><p>criminals run the prison system. </p><p></p></div>
