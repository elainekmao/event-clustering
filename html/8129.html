<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000909 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POSSIBLE DEAL FOR WARRI POLITICAL IMPASSE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 816 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Post\'s Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) met with </p><p>Temi Harriman, the National Assembly Representative (PDP) for </p><p>the Warri area, on May 13 in Abuja.  Although she </p><p>characterized polling in her constituency on both April 12 </p><p>and 19 (National Assembly and Presidential/Gubernatorial </p><p>elections, respectively) as almost non-existent, she </p><p>refrained from casting doubt on her renewed electoral </p><p>mandate.  She felt she was a strong candidate for Deputy </p><p>Speaker of the House, a position to be decided at a May 22 </p><p>PDP meeting in Port Harcourt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Commenting on the ongoing crisis in the Warri area, </p><p>Harriman, an Itsekiri, blamed  the new outbreak of violence </p><p>on Ijaw youth in the Warri Southwest Local Government Area </p><p>(LGA).  She rejected Ijaw claims that this LGA is populated </p><p>predominantly by Ijaws.  Similarly, she dismissed Ijaw </p><p>demands to control the majority of the LGA\'s 10 electoral </p><p>wards, six of which are currently controlled by Itsekiri. </p><p>Nevertheless, she emphasized that her constituency, the three </p><p>LGAs of Warri, include substantial numbers of Ijaw and </p><p>Uhrobos in addition to her fellow Itsekiri; she claimed to be </p><p>working with moderate Ijaw leaders who in turn have given her </p><p>political support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) During the meeting at Harriman\'s Abuja residence, </p><p>Jefferson Arubi, the PDP candidate  for the Chairman of the </p><p>Warri Southwest local government area, arrived with an </p><p>"emergency" issue to discuss with Harriman.  According to the </p><p>visibly agitated Arubi, the Delta PDP had just reassigned him </p><p>to run for the lower office of Deputy Chairman, while </p><p>elevating an Ijaw candidate to the Chairmanship candidacy. </p><p>Arubi claimed this was the handiwork of Delta  Governor James </p><p>Ibori (PDP); Arubi said he had been told that any attempt to </p><p>resist this change would lead to his expulsion from the </p><p>party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Harriman\'s immediate response was negative, because </p><p>Warri Southwest LGA had been historically controlled by </p><p>Itsekiri.  Upon reflection, however, she noted that this was </p><p>likely an attempt by the Presidency to ameliorate the Warri </p><p>crisis by giving the Ijaw a taste of politcal power in Warri. </p><p> She advised Arubi to accept the Deputy Chairman position and </p><p>inform the Ijaw candidate that the Itsekiri have accepted </p><p>this move in the name of peace.  The Ijaw should not, </p><p>however, consider the arrangement permanent; in four years </p><p>the Chairmanship should revert to Itsekiri control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Comment:  The militant Ijaw youth of Warri have vowed </p><p>to block the June 21 LGA elections.  Ijaws fear the Itsekiri </p><p>will dominate the elections.  The effort to give the </p><p>Chairmanship of the LGA to the Ijaw certainly looks like an </p><p>attempt to help defuse the crisis.  While this solution is a </p><p>stop-gap measure and does not address the fundamental Ijaw </p><p>grievances of the Warri Southwest LGA, it offers the Ijaw </p><p>tangible political concessions that might help ease tensions. </p><p> This gesture by itself, however, is probably inadequate to </p><p>mollify the Ijaw militants.  The challenge will now be for </p><p>traditional Ijaw leaders such as Chief E.K. Clark to "sell" </p><p>this development as a meaningful gain to the rebellious, </p><p>sometimes criminally inclined, Ijaw youth in the marshy areas </p><p>of Warri. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
