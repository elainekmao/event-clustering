<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000979 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D (Gastright), INR/MR, I/RW, I/REC, SA (Camp, </p><p>Waller), SA/PD (Brennig, Irwin, Scenscy), SSA/PAB, </p><p>SSO (pass to D) Tokyo (Hara, Bryan) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA PLAY   Subject:  Media Play (June 6):  Tokyo </p><p>conference; Colombo. </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  As the Tokyo conference approaches, the media </p><p>scene grows dyspeptic.  "Ways to solve [the] dispute ... can </p><p>be found," the Prime Minister is reported to argue, but </p><p>others speak of racists, i.e., Sinhalese nationalists, who </p><p>want the LTTE to miss Tokyo, while voices closer to the LTTE </p><p>blame the impasse on the GSL.  An editorial in the LTTE- </p><p>leaning SUDAR OLI is even more brutal and an article in the </p><p>LTTE\'s web site says that the "political bankruptcy of the </p><p>Sri Lankan state in solving the ethnic conflict never stood </p><p>so well exposed."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>2. Headlines </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>In the moments prior to his departure for Tokyo Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremasinghe spoke pro-peace once again.  His </p><p>comments resonate in the English and vernacular press.  The </p><p>DAILY MIRROR (independent English daily) says "PM insists no </p><p>more war" and "fervent plea for world community to help </p><p>build peace process in Sri Lanka."  The ISLAND (independent </p><p>but nationalist-leaning English daily) agrees:  "Ways to </p><p>solve dispute over interim admin. can be found - PM." </p><p>THINAKKURAL (independent Tamil daily) quotes the PM as </p><p>seeing "not much of difference between the government and </p><p>LTTE regarding the Interim Administrative Council."  And </p><p>VIRAKESARI (independent Tamil daily) weighs in with </p><p>"International countries are interested in peace efforts, no </p><p>chance for talking of war again - Tokyo Conference a great </p><p>support for the peace efforts - Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremasinghe." </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, the PM\'s cheerleading is accompanied by </p><p>catcalls.  DIVAINA (independent but nationalist-leaning </p><p>Sinhala daily) reports simply that "Tigers say NO...." </p><p>DINAMINA (government-owned Sinhala daily) says that "Racists </p><p>[i.e., Sinhalese nationalists) are in favor of LTTE\'s </p><p>absence at the Confab."  And SUDAR OLI (independent but LTTE- </p><p>leaning Tamil daily) has LTTE leader S. P. Tamilselvan </p><p>blaming the impasse on the GSL:  "The Sri Lankan government </p><p>should take responsibility for non-participation of Tigers </p><p>at the Tokyo Conference, Tamilselvan informs UNHCR </p><p>Official." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>3. Editorials </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline "Tokyo conference and Liberation Tigers" </p><p>SUDAR OLI (independent but LTTE-leaning Tamil daily) blames </p><p>the GSL for creating the impasse by rejecting an interim </p><p>administration that would "give the Tigers more muscle."  It </p><p>may be true, SUDAR OLI says, that "the Tigers could have </p><p>bargained for more aid had they attended the Tokyo </p><p>Conference.  But if there is no proper structure to utilize </p><p>the funds received -- however much is received -- what is </p><p>the use? </p><p> </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>The Tokyo Conference attended by Donor Countries will be </p><p>held in two days and the chances of Tiger participation ... </p><p>are very remote.  Anton Balasingham\'s reply to Prime </p><p>Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and the recent statement made </p><p>by Tamilselvan to British, Dutch, and Swiss diplomats show </p><p>that the chances of Tiger participation at the conference </p><p>are very remote. </p><p> </p><p>There wouldn\'t be a problem if the government would </p><p>establish an Interim Administrative Council that would give </p><p>the Tigers more muscle to pursue reconstruction, </p><p>resettlement, and rehabilitation in the north and east.  ... </p><p>to bring normality back to the peninsula.  Then the Tigers </p><p>would attend the Tokyo Conference, and the peace talks too, </p><p>would resume. </p><p> </p><p>But the government is not ready to establish an Interim </p><p>Administration.  Anton Balasingham has pointed out that the </p><p>Councils in the government\'s proposals will be powerless, </p><p>like SIHRN is, and are unacceptable.  Tamilselvan has also </p><p>informed the diplomats who visited Vanni to pressurize the </p><p>Tigers to attend the Tokyo Conference, that the </p><p>International Community should pressurize the government to </p><p>accept the Interim Administration Structure proposed by the </p><p>Tigers. </p><p> </p><p>Tamilselvan said that the Diplomats agreed with his </p><p>grievances but were unsure whether they would insist that </p><p>the government establish the Interim Administration </p><p>structure. </p><p>It is true that the Tigers could have bargained for more aid </p><p>had they attended the Tokyo Conference.  But if there is no </p><p>proper structure to utilize the funds received -- however </p><p>much is received -- what is the use? </p><p> </p><p>And where is the assurance that the government won\'t use the </p><p>full amount, as in the past, on the development of the </p><p>South. </p><p> </p><p>The Government thinks that aid Tiger participation would </p><p>increase aid, but is not interested in giving the north and </p><p>east its rightful share. </p><p> </p><p>By insisting on the Interim Administration, the Tigers have </p><p>passed the ball into Government\'s court.  Is there a way </p><p>out? </p><p> </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>4. Web sites </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline "Political confusion in Colombo said </p><p>undermining peace" the LTTE\'s TAMILNET castigates "the </p><p>political bankruptcy of the Sri Lankan State."  Quoting a </p><p>Tamil National Alliance MP, Selvam Adaikalanathan, TAMILNET </p><p>says: </p><p> </p><p>Block quote. </p><p> </p><p>"It would be absolutely imprudent on our part to predicate </p><p>the future of the Tamil people on the unpredictable </p><p>political climate we are witnessing in Colombo now.  It is </p><p>getting progressively unstable.  A politically powerful </p><p>section of the Sinhala Buddhist clergy asserts that </p><p>President Kumaratunga wowed during a meeting with its </p><p>leaders that she would divide the Northeast province.  The </p><p>political bankruptcy of the Sri Lankan state in solving the </p><p>ethnic conflict never stood so well exposed," said Mr. </p><p>Selvam Adaikalanathan, MP, a senior leader of the Tamil </p><p>National Alliance. </p><p> </p><p>End block quote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
