<p>S E C R E T STATE 031692 </p><p> </p><p>ALMATY FOR DUSHANBE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 2/18/09 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PGOV, AF </p><p>SUBJECT: TALIBAN CLAIM BIN LADEN OUT OF THEIR TERRITORY </p><p> </p><p>REF:   A) ISLAMABAD 875 (NOTAL)   B) ISLAMABAD 1171 (NOTAL) </p><p>C)   ISLAMABAD 1273 (NOTAL)  D)   ISLAMABAD 1271 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY KARL F.  INDERFURTH, A/S,  SA.  REASON:  1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.   (S)  SUMMARY:  TALIBAN UN "PERMREP DESIGNATE" ABDUL </p><p>HAKEEM MUJAHID TOLD SA A/S INDERFURTH FEBRUARY 17 THAT </p><p>USAMA BIN LADEN  (UBL) WAS NO LONGER IN TALIBAN-CONTROLLED </p><p>TERRITORY.   HE WOULD NOT PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS BUT </p><p>IMPLIED THAT UBL WAS ELSEWHERE IN AFGHANISTAN THOUGH EN </p><p>ROUTE TO A FOREIGN DESTINATION.    HE SAID  THE CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>WOULD BE CLARIFIED IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS.    A/S INDERFURTH </p><p>EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT THAT UBL HAD NOT BEEN EXPELLED TO </p><p>A JURISDICTION WHERE HE COULD BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE; THIS </p><p>WAS OUR ULTIMATE GOAL.   HE ALSO ASKED THE TALIBAN TO EXPEL </p><p>UBL\'S NETWORK FROM AFGHANISTAN AND CLOSE EXISTING TERRORIST </p><p>TRAINING FACILITIES.   MUJAHID ASKED THAT USG PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS ON THIS DEVELOPMENT NOT DWELL ON EXISTING </p><p>DIFFERENCES WITH THE TALL BAN, NOTING THAT THIS WOULD WEAKEN </p><p>ELEMENTS WITHIN THE TALIBAN OPPOSED TO UBL.    A/S INDERFURTH </p><p>REPLIED THAT WHILE WE COULD NOT WISH AWAY OTHER ISSUES, BIN </p><p>LADEN\'S DEPARTURE FROM AFGHANISTAN WOULD REMOVES A MAJOR </p><p>ROADBLOCK TO FUTURE PROGRESS.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U)  SA A/S KARL F. INDERFURTH CALLED IN TALIBAN NEW </p><p>YORK "PERMREP DESIGNATE" ABDUL HAKEEM MUJAHID FEBRUARY 1~ </p><p>PRIMARILY TO REVIEW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING USAMA BIN </p><p>LADEN  (UBL) AND AS PART OF OUR SERIES OF CONTACTS WITH THE </p><p>AFGHAN FACTIONS.   MUJAHID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ASSISTANT </p><p>NOORULLAH ZADRAN.   SA/PAB DIRECTOR MALINOWSKI AND AFGHAN </p><p>DESKOFF RAPOPORT SAT IN.   THE MEETING LASTED ALMOST 90 </p><p>MINUTES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHERE IS USAMA? </p><p> </p><p>3.   (S)  A/S INDERFURTH REVIEWED HIS FEBRUARY 3 MEETING </p><p>WITH TALIBAN "DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER" MULLAH JALIL IN </p><p>ISLAMABAD,  RESTATING POINTS DELIVERED ON THAT OCCASION (REF </p><p>A).  HE NOTED THE TALIBAN RESPONSE THAT THEY HAD IMPOSED </p><p>FURTHER RESTRICTIONS UPON UBL  (REF B) BUT STATED THAT THIS </p><p>DID NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.   HE CITED RECENT REPORTS OF </p><p>ONGOING THREATENING ACTIVITIES FROM UBL AND HIS NETWORK AND </p><p>MADE THE POINT THAT RECENT REPORTS FROM TALIBAN SOURCES </p><p>THAT UBL HAD "GONE MISSING"  (REF C) CONTRADICTED TALIBAN </p><p>CLAIMS TO HAVE HIM UNDER CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (S)  MUJAHID CITED THE IMPORTANCE OF A/S INDERFURTH\'S </p><p>MESSAGE TO JALIL AND SAID HE HAD PERSONALLY CONTACTED </p><p>VARIOUS TALIBAN AUTHORITIES TO GET A POSITIVE RESPONSE SO </p><p>AS TO PROMOTE A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S.  HE </p><p>ASSERTED THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE TALIBAN TO EXPEL UBL </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT UPON PUBLIC OPINION IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, BUT THE TALL BAN HAD IMPOSED </p><p>RESTRICTIONS UPON HIM IN HOPES OF FORCING HIM TO LEAVE </p><p>WILLINGLY.   MUJAHID THEN DECLARED THAT UBL WAS NO LONGER IN </p><p>TALIBAN-CONTROLLED TERRITORY BUT WOULD NOT SAY WHERE HE WAS </p><p>OR HOW THIS HAD COME ABOUT, ONLY THAT THE SITUATION WOULD </p><p>BE CLARIFIED IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS.   HE INTIMATED THAT UBL </p><p>MIGHT STILL BE IN AFGHANISTAN,  PERHAPS WITH A COMMANDER NOT </p><p>LINKED TO THE TALIBAN  (IN THIS CONTEXT HE REFERRED TO UBL\'S </p><p>PREVIOUS TIES TO HEKMATYAR,  SAYYAF, AND MASOOD.) BUT THAT </p><p>HIS ULTIMATE DESTINATION WAS AN UNSPECIFIED OTHER COUNTRY. </p><p>HE STATED THAT TALIBAN LEADER MULLAH OMAR HAD ANNOUNCED </p><p>UBL\'S DEPARTURE PUBLICLY OVER TALIBAN RADIO SHARIAT; HE </p><p>PROCEEDED TO DO THE SAME WITH AWAITING JOURNALISTS AFTER </p><p>THE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRING UBL TO JUSTICE </p><p> </p><p>5.   (S) A/S INDERFURTH SAID WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE </p><p>TALIBAN HAD NOT EXPELLED UBL TO A JURISDICTION WHERE HE </p><p>COULD BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.   HE EXPRESSED FURTHER CONCERN </p><p>REGARDING THE TIME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE UBL\'S </p><p>WHEREABOUTS, NOTING THAT THE AMBIGUITY POSED CERTAIN RISKS </p><p>FOR AFGHANISTAN AND URGED THAT THE TALIBAN PROVIDE MORE </p><p>INFORMATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  IF UBL STAGED A </p><p>TERRORIST ACT DURING THIS INTERIM PERIOD,  BEFORE HIS </p><p>WHEREABOUTS COULD BE ESTABLISHED,  THE TALIBAN COULD STILL </p><p>BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. HE STATED WE WOULD CONTINUE EFFORTS TO </p><p>LOCATE HIM, ADDING THAT IT WOULD BE TAKEN AS AN ACT OF BAD </p><p>FAITH IF UBL WERE PERMITTED TO RETURN TO TALIBAN-CONTROLLED </p><p>TERRITORY.   MUJAHID RESPONDED THAT UBL WOULD NOT RETURN TO </p><p>TALIBAN TERRITORY, THOUGH HE LATER CAVEATED THAT THIS WAS </p><p>NOT IN HIS OFFICIAL INSTRUCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AND EXPEL HIS FOLLOWERS </p><p> </p><p>6.   (S) A/S INDERFURTH ADDED THAT WE WERE ALSO CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT UBL\'S NETWORK AND TRAINING CAMPS INSIDE AFGHANISTAN. </p><p>HE HOPED THE TALIBAN WOULD TAKE QUICK ACTION TO REMOVE </p><p>THESE SUPPORT STRUCTURES AND EXPEL THOSE MEMBERS OF HIS </p><p>NETWORK LEFT BEHIND.   MUJAHID RESPONDED THAT AFGHANISTAN </p><p>HAD NEVER BEEN A TERRORIST STATE AND THAT AFGHANS HAD NEVER </p><p>COMMITTED ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM,  EVEN AGAINST THE </p><p>SOVIETS.   THE TALIBAN ITSELF DID NOT SUPPORT AN AVOWEDLY </p><p>EXPANSIONIST INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT, </p><p>LIKE IRANIAN-SUPPORTED HEZBOLLAH OR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, </p><p>AND WAS NOT IN FAVOR OR THE TRAINING IN AFGHANISTAN OF </p><p>KASHMIRIS, ARABS,  SAUDIS, SUDANESE OR OTHERS IN TECHNIQUES </p><p>OF TERRORISM.   MUJAHID NOTED THAT BIN LADEN\'S PERSONAL VIEW </p><p>OF INTERNATIONAL ISLAM WAS MUCH CLOSER TO THAT OF MANY OF </p><p>THE TALIBAN\'S AFGHAN RIVALS THAN TO THAT OF THE TALIBAN </p><p>ITSELF.   MUJAHID EQUIVOCATED ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF CAMPS </p><p>IN TALIBAN TERRITORY BUT A/S INDERFURTH REPEATED THAT THEY </p><p>WERE PRESENT AND THAT STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO DISMANTLE </p><p>THEM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT REQUESTED </p><p> </p><p>7.   (S)  NOTING THAT THE TALIBAN HAD PUT ITSELF IN A </p><p>DIFFICULT POSITION REGARDING UBL, MUJAHID ASKED THAT USG </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS NOT DWELL ON DIFFERENCES OVER OTHER </p><p>ISSUES  (I.E.  DRUGS, HUMAN RIGHTS, GENDER, ETC.), STATING </p><p>THAT THIS WOULD WEAKEN THOSE WITHIN THE TALIBAN WHO FAVORED </p><p>BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.    HE URGED A POSITIVE </p><p>REFERENCE TO THIS ACTION.    A/S INDERFURTH SAID THAT WE </p><p>WOULD CONSIDER UBL\'S DEPARTURE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>NOTING THAT BIN LADEN HAD BEEN A MAJOR OBSTACLE,   "A BOULDER </p><p>IN THE ROAD."    WE COULD NOT WISH OTHER ISSUES AWAY, BUT </p><p>ONCE BIN LADEN WAS BEHIND US WE COULD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, </p><p>INCLUDING HUMAN RIGHTS, BILATERALLY AND THROUGH THE UN IN </p><p>AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP.    MUJAHID CITED THE </p><p>STRONG U.S. RELATIONSHIP    WITH ISLAMIC SAUDI ARABIA AND </p><p>SAID WE COULD HAVE EVEN BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p>8.   AS AN EXAMPLE OF A POSITIVE STEP, A/S INDERFURTH NOTED </p><p>HIS SIGNATURE YESTERDAY ON A DISASTER DECLARATION THAT </p><p>WOULD AUTHORIZE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 11 EARTHQUAKE    (REF D) AS A POSITIVE STEP AND </p><p>EVIDENCE OF OUR DESIRE TO HELP THE AFGHAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TALIBAN EXPANDING CONTACTS </p><p> </p><p>9.   (S)  A/S INDERFURTH RAISED UN SPECIAL ENVOY BRAHIMI\'S </p><p>UPCOMING VISIT TO THE REGION, NOTING THAT IT WAS COMING AT </p><p>A TIME WHEN THE TALIBAN WAS EXPANDING CONTACTS WITH OTHER </p><p>AFGHAN FACTIONS AND WITH AFGHAN MODERATES.    HE STRESSED OUR </p><p>BELIEF THAT THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT </p><p>BUT RATHER A NEED FOR A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT AND URGED THE </p><p>TALIBAN TO WORK WITH BRAHIMI IN THIS REGARD.    MUJAHID </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THE CONTACTS WITH MASOOD AND THE NEUTRALS, </p><p>ADDING THAT THE TALIBAN HAD ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH </p><p>PROFESSOR BURHANUDDIN RABBANI\'S PEOPLE IN DUBAL AS WELL. </p><p>HE AGREED THAT A MILITARY SOLUTION WAS "NOT DESIRABLE" BUT </p><p>SAID THAT DIPLOMATIC MEANS DID NOT ALWAYS WORK.  MUJAHID </p><p>WAS SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE AFGHAN MODERATES, WHOM HE </p><p>DESCRIBED AS PARTISANS OF THE FORMER KING.  HE SAID THEY </p><p>CONFINED THEIR ACTIVITIES TO "MAKING INEFFECTIVE STATEMENTS </p><p>ABROAD," BUT THEY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO RETURN TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN AND WORK WITH THE TALIBAN TO REBUILD THE </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>10.   (S)  COMMENT: MUJAHID HAS LONG INDICATED HIS OWN </p><p>OPPOSITION TO UBL AND SUPPORT FOR BETTER RELATIONS BETWEEN </p><p>THE U.S. AND THE TALIBAN. IT WAS CLEARLY GRATIFYING FOR </p><p>HIM TO DELIVER THE NEWS THAT UBL HAD LEFT TALL BAN </p><p>TERRITORY. MUJAHID WAS MORE EMOTIONAL DURING THIS SESSION </p><p>THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS ENCOUNTER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TALBOTT </p><p></p></div>
