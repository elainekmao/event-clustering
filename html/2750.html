<p>S E C R E T KATHMANDU 000735 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, ASEC, PHUM, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: INDIA TURNS OVER EIGHT MAOISTS TO NEPAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 731 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>PM Confirms India Turned Over Maoists </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) India turned over eight suspected Maoists to Nepal </p><p>April 10, Prime Minister Deuba confirmed to Ambassador April </p><p>12 (Reftel).  The PM claimed that the suspects - who he </p><p>described as "low-level" - had been apprehended based on </p><p>intelligence provided by the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA).  RNA </p><p>Chief of Army Staff Rana made the same claim April 11. </p><p> </p><p>Leaked, Planted or Both </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The turn-over was reported in the Indian media and </p><p>international wire services.  These reports state that the </p><p>eight Maoists - including one woman - were picked up at </p><p>clinics and nursing facilities in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh </p><p>where they were being treated for combat-related injuries. </p><p>Authorities were searching for accomplices believed to have </p><p>brought the wounded to India for treatment, and were also </p><p>attempting to track the source of the funds used for the </p><p>medical care, press reports mentioned.  Local media in Nepal </p><p>have yet to run the story. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) This is a good start to the promise of Nepal-India </p><p>cooperation against the Maoist insurgency.  As noted Reftel, </p><p>it may have been the result of recent U.S., U.K. and Nepalese </p><p>visits to New Delhi.  That India apparently fed the details </p><p>to the press to get the message out may bode well for future </p><p>operations of this kind. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
