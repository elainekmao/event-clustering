The results of the Coalition assessment of health </p><p>facilities in Basrah City were briefed at the Humanitarian </p><p>Operations Center on 10 April.  The assessment found that </p><p>most of the 82 primary health centers are functioning and </p><p>have sufficient staff, supplies, and equipment for the </p><p>present time.  However, concerns expressed at all the </p><p>hospitals visited were the lack of water, lack of </p><p>electricity, and insecurity, in that order.   The Government </p><p>of Kuwait has made a contribution of five types of fuels to </p><p>Iraq.  Although initial information indicates that the </p><p>propane would be provided in bottles, a request has been </p><p>submitted through the Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society that the </p><p>propane be provided via tankers and transported into Iraq. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>COALITION ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH FACILITIES IN BASRAH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  According to reports from Coalition Civil Affairs units, </p><p>the Director of the Basrah Governorate health authority is </p><p>trying to restart normal health activities.  Many staff have </p><p>continued to work.  The governorate\'s medical stores are </p><p>intact and contain an estimated three months\' worth of drugs </p><p>and supplies.  The communicable disease surveillance system, </p><p>which was operating normally before the war, has not </p><p>collected data from outpatient facilities since the onset of </p><p>fighting.  An emergency surveillance system, implemented </p><p>with the assistance of the International Committee of the </p><p>Red Cross (ICRC), continued to collect this disease data </p><p>from hospitals during the war.  No outbreaks have been </p><p>discovered, although the public health authorities are on </p><p>heightened alert to the possibility.  The Director is </p><p>concerned about the ability to vaccinate children.  There </p><p>are some stocks of vaccine, and the cold chain is intact, </p><p>but additional supplies will be needed shortly. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Most of the 82 primary health centers in Basrah City are </p><p>functioning and have sufficient staff, supplies, and </p><p>equipment for the present time.  The medical school is not </p><p>functioning because the teaching hospital was hit by </p><p>aerial bombardment during the war.  No information about the </p><p>status of the nursing school in Basrah was available. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The greatest concerns expressed by the Director and the </p><p>health staff at all hospitals visited were the lack of </p><p>water, lack of electricity, and insecurity, in that order. </p><p>Coalition engineers are attempting to repair the water and </p><p>electrical systems in hospitals and the city as a whole. </p><p>Hospital staff and Coalition forces are guarding each </p><p>hospital and the central medical stores to prevent looting. </p><p>To date, only military hospitals have been looted. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Secondary concerns expressed by the Director and </p><p>hospital medical staff include: payment of salaries for </p><p>ancillary hospital staff, communications, and transport. </p><p>Physicians were not concerned about their own salaries, but </p><p>were worried that if nurses and ancillary staff were not </p><p>paid soon, they would find jobs elsewhere.  Many have not </p><p>been paid in months.  Apparently, hospitals in Basrah have </p><p>accounts in local Iraqi banks, but do not currently have </p><p>access to deposits in order to meet payroll.  Coalition </p><p>authorities are discussing pay scales and may </p><p>offer salary support to hospital staff according to a </p><p>uniform scheme. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Communications are difficult because the telephone </p><p>system is not operational in Basrah.  There has never been a </p><p>cell phone network.  Before the war, Basrah hospitals </p><p>provided transport for hospital employees to get </p><p>to work and back, and this capacity has been lost because of </p><p>looting of vehicles.  Emergency transport of patients cannot </p><p>be done because ambulances have been looted.  Some </p><p>ambulances have been located, but they had been completely </p><p>stripped and cannot be used. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The 285-bed port hospital is intact and providing full </p><p>services.  Staffing is adequate with 65 physicians.  The </p><p>electricity supply is consistent, and although the </p><p>hospital has some water, it could use more.  Coalition </p><p>forces are providing an emergency supply of water and </p><p>oxygen. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Coalition forces are supplying the 200-bed Basrah </p><p>General Hospital with 30,000 liters of water per day.  As </p><p>with the port hospital, Basrah General is short of oxygen, </p><p>which the Coalition is supplying.  The central medical </p><p>stores for the governorate are located on the grounds of </p><p>this hospital. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Naval dispensary and medical stores have been </p><p>completely looted and are no longer functional.  Those Iraqi </p><p>military medical authorities who have remained in Basrah are </p><p>working with civilian health authorities to consolidate </p><p>whatever military medical staff and equipment remain in </p><p>Basrah in order to begin providing care. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The health center in Al-Adar, just north of Basrah </p><p>City, has been completely destroyed.  No further details are </p><p>available. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FUEL </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Government of Kuwait has made a contribution of </p><p>five types of petroleum products to Iraq.  The contribution </p><p>will be made available in set quantities on a weekly or </p><p>twice weekly basis and will be comprised of diesel for </p><p>cooking, unleaded fuel for transport, kerosene for cooking </p><p>and to power generators, propane for cooking, and engine </p><p>oil. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Initial information, acquired through the Humanitarian </p><p>Operations Center (HOC), indicated that the propane would be </p><p>provided in bottles.  Given the difficulties related to the </p><p>handling and transporting of several thousand filled </p><p>bottles, and the fact that Iraqi gas fittings are different </p><p>from Kuwaiti fittings, a request has been submitted through </p><p>the Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society that the propane be </p><p>provided via tankers and transported into Iraq where it can </p><p>be put into local gas bottles. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The Salvation Army says it is researching the rental of </p><p>propane gas trucks, seeking the adapters able to fill Iraqi </p><p>gas bottles from Kuwaiti tanker fittings, and attempting to </p><p>determine costs.  The Salvation Army has approximately USD 1 </p><p>million of private funds to support this venture and will </p><p>also be coordinating with the HOC on security and convoy </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Save the Children says it is continuing to assess means </p><p>for implementing a one-time fuel distribution in Umm Qasr </p><p>through the public distribution system (PDS).  Save the </p><p>Children is working with local representatives, in </p><p>coordination with the World Food Program (WFP) and </p><p>International Organization for Migraton (IOM) to determine </p><p>the most appropriate means for collecting, filling, and re- </p><p>distributing filled bottles, possibly a voucher system. </p><p>Save the Children is also trying to determine if a system of </p><p>prioritization can be instituted as there may not be enough </p><p>fuel for all families, and needs will grow as more areas </p><p>become accessible. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
