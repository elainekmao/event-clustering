<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002729 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: OREP, PREL, PGOV, SENV, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN LEGISLATORS HOST CODEL DASCHLE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2665 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  On August 31, CODEL Daschle met Senate </p><p>President Anyim, Deputy House Speaker Nwuche, and other </p><p>members of the National Assembly Leadership. Discussions </p><p>touched on democracy and rule of law in Nigeria, trade </p><p>relations and expanding Nigeria\'s economy, natural gas </p><p>production issues, Executive-Legislative branch disputes </p><p>and the campaign against the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Some of the </p><p>Nigerian legislators were curious about the inner workings </p><p>of a more established democratic system and how they could </p><p>adapt these lessons. However, while they voiced many of the </p><p>right platitudes, the Nigerian lawmakers did not appear </p><p>well-versed on key public policy issues; they seemed more </p><p>interested in safeguarding their powers and privileges than </p><p>in improving the performance of their Chambers.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim and Deputy House </p><p>Speaker Prince Chibudom Nwuche welcomed Senators Daschle </p><p>(D-SD), Reid (D-NV), Nighthorse-Campbell (R-CO) and </p><p>Bingaman (D-NM) to the Senate Chambers  during the Codel\'s </p><p>visit on August 31.  Ambassador Jeter, Codel staff members </p><p>and other Embassy and USAID staff were also in attendance. </p><p>Opening the session, Anyim welcomed the Codel, highlighting </p><p>the improvement in US-Nigerian relations over recent years. </p><p>Daschle commented that making Nigeria the final stop on the </p><p>trip was appropriate, given its importance, both regionally </p><p>and internationally.  The Codel then toured the Senate\'s </p><p>new information center (a NDI project) and the Senate </p><p>Chambers before returning to Anyim\'s office for a closed </p><p>session to allow for an exchange of ideas among the </p><p>attendees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Senator Reid questioned Anyim about the impeachment </p><p>threat against President Obasanjo.  Anyim flippantly </p><p>contended that the stand-off was "merely democracy at work </p><p>and no reason for alarm."  He said the Senate was </p><p>responsible to the people of Nigeria and that "the basic </p><p>tenets of democracy must be allowed to develop and </p><p>function."  He suggested that "electoral issues" were at </p><p>the core of the disagreement between the two branches but </p><p>did not elaborate what those issues were.  The Deputy </p><p>Speaker threw in that "parliaments throughout Africa are </p><p>under assault."  He said he had been warning the Presidency </p><p>and anyone else who cared to listen about the necessity of </p><p>respecting the Constitution and the importance of rule of </p><p>law for the past two years, and believed that other </p><p>improvements would follow from these two foundations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  When Senator Campbell asked about trade between </p><p>the U.S. and Nigeria, Anyim replied that the security of </p><p>Nigeria was more important.  He worried that the recent </p><p>State Department travel warning on Nigeria was </p><p>"counterproductive to trade."  Nevertheless, he expressed </p><p>his support for diversifying Nigeria\'s economy and </p><p>lessening reliance on the oil sector, commenting vaguely </p><p>that Nigeria has to "empower the people to expand trade." </p><p>He agreed the fundamental program envisioned in NEPAD was </p><p>sound, but without good governance, NEPAD would fail. </p><p>Daschle seconded Anyim\'s sentiment, commenting that rule of </p><p>law, free enterprise and democracy were all keys to </p><p>guaranteeing international support for NEPAD.  Daschle told </p><p>the Nigerian lawmakers the USG was committed to increasing </p><p>trade with Africa, as evidenced by AGOA.  The Deputy </p><p>Speaker advised the Senators that Nigeria is aware of the </p><p>importance of transparent governance and commented that </p><p>"what is good for Africa is good for the West." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Senator Bingaman asked about Nigeria\'s plans for </p><p>developing its natural gas sector and curbing gas flaring. </p><p>Anyim mentioned that a natural gas and anti-flaring bill </p><p>was currently before the Assembly; without providing </p><p>specifics, he said there had been "progress on it."  Anyim </p><p>noted the growing worldwide consciousness of environmental </p><p>issues and said that Nigeria was no exception to the trend. </p><p>The Deputy Speaker erroneously commented that AGIP was the </p><p>only company working to curtail flaring.  "The U.S. </p><p>companies are not pushing for a solution," he averred.  He </p><p>offered that the pending legislation would require new </p><p>exploration to re-inject the gas at the wellhead in order </p><p>to capture more crude oil while eliminating the flaring. </p><p>(Comment: The Deputy Speaker was wrong about the American </p><p>companies. He probably did not care about the veracity of </p><p>his statement -- because he likely said it for effect. </p><p>Later that day, Senator Bingaman met with American oil </p><p>company executives who summarized for him their plans to </p><p>end gas flaring.  They also told him that there would not </p><p>be any gas flaring at any of their newly developed wells </p><p>(reftel). End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Anyim asked the CODEL how the Nigerian Legislature </p><p>should deal with a President who refused to spend funds as </p><p>budgeted by Legislators.  Daschle responded, "Welcome to </p><p>democracy."  He reminded the legislators of the crisis that </p><p>shut down the USG several years ago and mentioned President </p><p>Bush\'s refusal to spend $5.5 billion recently budgeted by </p><p>Congress.  He pointed out that the two most contentious </p><p>issues for a democracy were budgets and war.  Advising the </p><p>Nigerian legislators to negotiate with the President rather </p><p>than fight him, Daschle stressed that "the institutions are </p><p>more important than the little fights."  Nighthorse- </p><p>Campbell added that the real authority is with the people </p><p>and "when they call you should listen." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Nigerians asked about USG support for HIV/AIDS </p><p>prevention and treatment programs, commenting that the U.S. </p><p>had not provided adequate funding in this area.  Daschle </p><p>said that the USG recognizes its responsibility, expressing </p><p>his opinion that the $500 million in recent U.S. budgets </p><p>was still insufficient and that support for expanding these </p><p>programs was growing in the U.S. Senate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT: The atmosphere during the meeting was </p><p>collegial. The Nigerians appeared eager to hear Codel </p><p>Daschle\'s experiences in reconciling the competing </p><p>interests of the Executive and Legislative branches.  While </p><p>this interest indicates some Nigerian politicians\' efforts </p><p>to chart a course in Nigeria\'s new democratic environment, </p><p>the focus and tone of the Nigerians\' questions show that, </p><p>for now, political bickering over the balance of power </p><p>between the Presidency and the National Assembly remained </p><p>the preferred course of action. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
