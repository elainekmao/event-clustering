A monthly food monitoring report issued by the National </p><p>NGO Food Security Network (FOSENET) suggests a slight </p><p>improvement in the food security situation across the country </p><p>since January due to wider distribution of relief food and </p><p>early harvests.  Despite these gains in rural areas, the </p><p>urban areas experienced a deterioration in food availability </p><p>because of the absence of urban feeding programs and the </p><p>scarcity and politicized distribution of Grain Marketing </p><p>Board (GMB) grain.  Political bias in GMB grain distribution </p><p>was a problem for roughly half the reporting districts but </p><p>was not a barrier to receiving relief food.  Information from </p><p>the partially functioning UN Relief Information and </p><p>Verification Office and an embassy database on incidents of </p><p>politicized food distributions suggests that most food </p><p>manipulations are of GMB food.  Urban areas and Matabeleland </p><p>were areas most affected by these biased food distributions. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD SITUATION </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  A monthly food monitoring report issued by the National </p><p>NGO Food Security Network (FOSENET) suggests a slight </p><p>improvement in the food security situation in half the rural </p><p>districts due to early harvest yields and successful WFP and </p><p>C-SAFE food aid distributions.  Urban areas have </p><p>deteriorating food security situations.  Exclusion from </p><p>beneficiary lists, transportation problems, policy gaps on </p><p>food supply for urban areas, and civil servants who cannot </p><p>get GMB food were the main obstacles to food access. </p><p> </p><p>3. FOSENET is a network of 24 Zimbabwean NGOs, organized in </p><p>March 2002 to monitor food needs, availability, and access </p><p>through NGOs based within districts and through community </p><p>based monitors.  This is FOSENET,s sixth report and covers </p><p>February and March 2003.  It is based upon 132 and 147 </p><p>reports from 53 and 58 districts for February and March, </p><p>respectively.  The number of districts is more than in </p><p>December/January. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Conclusions from the report are as follows: </p><p> </p><p>--By March, 31 districts, or 53 percent of responding </p><p>districts, reported an improved situation compared to more </p><p>than 60 percent of reporting districts reporting a </p><p>deteriorating food security situation in November, December, </p><p>and January. </p><p> </p><p>--Vulnerability stayed about the same with 49 percent of </p><p>districts reporting everyone in need of food.  In January it </p><p>was 47 percent. </p><p> </p><p>--GMB deliveries continued to be erratic but the average </p><p>volume of deliveries per ward increased to 7.3 tons up from </p><p>1.8 tons in January.  Matabeleland and Mashonaland East had </p><p>increased deliveries.  Hurungwe in Mashonaland West continued </p><p>to report wards that have received no GMB food since October. </p><p> Umguza in Matabeleland North received no food since January, </p><p>while Gwanda in Matabeleland South and Chikomba in </p><p>Mashonaland East received none since November 2002. </p><p> </p><p>-- Half the districts reported political bias in favor of </p><p>ZANU-PF party members in GMB grain access.  The cost of GMB </p><p>sales was still a barrier to access with the upper price </p><p>range for a 10-kg bag of corn meal being Z$300, 158 percent </p><p>above the controlled price. </p><p> </p><p>--Commercially supplied food was still scarce and expensive. </p><p>In 16 districts, workers for commercial suppliers, people </p><p>with political access, uniformed forces, youth (Green </p><p>Bombers), and people with business ties were granted access </p><p>to limited market supplies. </p><p> </p><p>-- The informal market prices reached Z$8000 for a 10-kg bag </p><p>of corn meal in some areas of the Midlands--almost 70 times </p><p>the controlled price.  The profit margin for GMB corn sold on </p><p>the informal market widened to Z$4200 from Z$2800 in January. </p><p> </p><p>--Relief supplies improved in Mashonaland East and West and </p><p>in some parts of Manicaland but the eight urban districts </p><p>received no relief supplies.  In two districts, Mhondoro in </p><p>Mashonaland West and Goromonzi in Mashonaland East, NGO </p><p>partners reportedly stopped food distributions because of </p><p>political interference. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>UN FOOD MONITORING AT STANDSTILL </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. The UN Relief and Recovery Unit\'s (RRU), Relief and </p><p>Information Verification Office (RIVO) has made little </p><p>progress since it opened the Mutare monitoring site in </p><p>eastern Zimbabwe in February.  Of the six UN volunteer field </p><p>monitors (UNV) George Olesh, head of RIVO, hopes to hire, </p><p>three are in Zimbabwe.  The other three have not been hired </p><p>because of a glitch within the UNDP system whereby the office </p><p>in Brussels has not wired the money to the account in New </p><p>York. The UNV main hiring office in Bonn, Germany will not </p><p>process further hiring requests until this money appears in </p><p>their New York account. (See Reftel).  In addition to </p><p>staffing shortfalls, RIVO is still waiting for GOZ support </p><p>and concurrence for the office\'s activities. </p><p> </p><p>6. Olesh told PolOff that the ECHO representative in Zimbabwe </p><p>asked when RIVO would begin validation and complained that </p><p>the office was moving too slowly. Olesh told PolOff that the </p><p>partners will most likely need to reconvene to redefine their </p><p>expectations from RIVO. (COMMENT. Admittedly, the RIVO has </p><p>been slow in setting up operations but it is not unexpected. </p><p>The UN agencies cannot proceed without government </p><p>concurrence, as other NGOs, with short-term interests, may be </p><p>able to do.  The UN agencies, in particular UNDP, have </p><p>long-term interests at stake and a favorable relationship </p><p>with the GOZ is necessary for long-term program success. END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>7. Olesh told PolOff that during the March 17 GOZ/Donor </p><p>meeting, the Swedish Ambassador asked Ministry of Social </p><p>Welfare representatives if there would be a RIVO.  The </p><p>government officials replied that they would not support </p><p>district level verification units as described in the </p><p>proposal.  Their preference is to have a centrally located </p><p>office and then deploy teams comprised of NGO and GOZ </p><p>representatives.  Olesh told us that such an arrangement </p><p>would defeat the purpose of the RIVO because the process </p><p>would be political and the reports would be edited down to </p><p>nothing. </p><p> </p><p>8. In spite of these setbacks, Olesh is still relatively </p><p>optimistic that he will be able to open another office within </p><p>the next few months.  He identified Gwanda in Matabeleland </p><p>South, which was declared a disaster area in March, as an </p><p>option.  He said since Matabeleland South has no active </p><p>governor, the provincial administrator must get a consensus </p><p>of all district administrators before RIVO activities can </p><p>proceed.  If the administrators make no decision by May 5, </p><p>Olesh said RIVO would try to open an office in Gweru, where </p><p>the governor is willing to host and support the effort. </p><p>Olesh also identified Muzarabani and Marondera in Mashonaland </p><p>Central as possible locations, banking on lingering district </p><p>and provincial level goodwill in response to UN relief </p><p>efforts during the Muzarabani floods in February. </p><p> </p><p>9. Olesh told us that most of the complaints UNDP receives </p><p>about food distributions have to do with beneficiary </p><p>registrations and rates of expansions and have nothing to do </p><p>with politicization of food distributions.  Most of the </p><p>complaints about politicized food come from Harare and </p><p>Bulawayo and involve access to GMB food. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>LITTLE POLITICAL BIAS IN NGO FOOD ACCESS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. PolOff has been keeping a database of incidents of food </p><p>distribution along political lines since October 2002. </p><p>Database entries are anecdotal reports by US Embassy </p><p>employees and friends of Embassy employees, press reports, </p><p>and individual NGO reports.  The results of the database </p><p>suggest little in the way of political interference in </p><p>international relief food distributions but a fair amount of </p><p>interference in GMB food distributions.  Most reports of </p><p>political interference came from Matabeleland. </p><p> </p><p>11. In its most recent report, FOSENET reported sites in the </p><p>following districts as having difficulty with food access due </p><p>to political bias in food distribution: Lupane and Bubi in </p><p>Matabeleland North; Chimanimani and Mutare rural in </p><p>Manicaland; and Chinhoyi urban in Mashonaland West. </p><p> </p><p>12. On April 1, the World Food Program issued a report of </p><p>suspensions and delays of WFP food distributions in 2003.  In </p><p>half of the investigated incidents, which include the Insiza </p><p>incident reported in reftel, WFP suspected a political </p><p>motive.  Only in Insiza are food distributions still </p><p>suspended.  The NGOs involved in these isolated incidents are </p><p>ORAP in Insiza, World Vision in Murehwa and Wedza, and </p><p>Christian Care in Buhera. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13. The utility of the RIVO is waning fast.  The Ministry of </p><p>Social Welfare\'s refusal to cooperate or endorse the effort </p><p>at the GOZ/donor meeting essentially eliminates any hopes the </p><p>donor community may have had to monitor GMB food.  Since </p><p>there are few allegations of politicized food distributions </p><p>among relief agencies, the RIVO will have limited usefulness. </p><p> Fortunately, food access has steadily improved since the </p><p>beginning of the year and fewer rural districts have to </p><p>contend with the biases of the GMB. END COMMENT. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
