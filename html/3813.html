<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002157 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPERS CRITICIZE INACTION IN </p><p>ABUJA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under title "The dialogue of the deaf" the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Financial Gazette\' (09/26) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "South African President Thabo Mbeki and his </p><p>      Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo have </p><p>      predictably decided to postpone taking the tough </p><p>      decisions that had been expected from them on </p><p>      Zimbabwe, underlining once more that they value </p><p>      the bonds of African brotherhood above all else. </p><p>      In doing so, the two leaders have inevitably </p><p>      placed themselves in direct conflict with </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s democratic forces and all who seek a </p><p>      negotiated solution to a low-level conflict </p><p>      which increasingly threatens southern Africa\'s </p><p>      peace and stability. . .  When the present story </p><p>      of Zimbabwe is finally written in years to come, </p><p>      Mbeki and Obasanjo will stand out as the two </p><p>      leaders who, at a critical time, thwarted the </p><p>      people\'s interests by siding with those in </p><p>      power. . .  They and all others who genuinely </p><p>      wish Zimbabwe well should know better by now: </p><p>      Harare never cares or listens to diplomacy and </p><p>      it will not suddenly do so now or after the </p><p>      March deadline.  These two leaders must take </p><p>      full responsibility for whatever happens next in </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s descent into chaos.  Their </p><p>      determination to secure short-term political </p><p>      interests while postponing the inevitable, </p><p>      however painful, could yet prove too costly for </p><p>      them and their colleagues." </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under title "Abuja let-off could unleash more </p><p>      violence" the independent daily "The Daily News" </p><p>      (09/26) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .If Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo </p><p>      expect President Mugabe to be magnanimous in his </p><p>      victory in Abuja, then they are woefully ill- </p><p>      informed about his party\'s dossier of violence. </p><p>      In rejoicing at their victory, many of his ZANU </p><p>      PF supporters may unleash a new wave of violence </p><p>      against the opposition - just for the hell of </p><p>      it.  The failure to intensify sanctions against </p><p>      Zimbabwe. . .could return to haunt the </p><p>      Commonwealth, but particularly Mbeki and </p><p>      Obasanjo. . .  But the will of the people of </p><p>      Zimbabwe will not be denied expression for long. </p><p>      It would be preferable if, in the end, it was </p><p>      done peacefully.  What Mbeki and Obasanjo are </p><p>      doing is to offer them a frightening option." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
