<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003648 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>ECON DAO RAO FCS PA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  SURF\'S UP: THE EBB AND FLOW OF THE JORDANIAN </p><p>BOYCOTT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) AMMAN 3394 B) AMMAN 2093 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) While anecdotal evidence suggests that a nationwide </p><p>boycott of American products has waned for the time being, </p><p>support at the street level remains strong.  Despite GOJ </p><p>efforts in various fora to discourage the action, boycotters </p><p>seem to be determined to make a statement by rejecting what </p><p>they see as symbols of American culture, regardless of </p><p>possibly detrimental effects on the local economy.  Increased </p><p>support for the boycott on a moral/personal level rather than </p><p>a symbolic/political level can only reinforce what may become </p><p>an established aversion to things American.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>THE NUMBERS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Since calls for a boycott reached a peak this </p><p>spring (REF B), enthusiasm for it has ebbed and flowed as </p><p>intensity of anger towards the U.S., driven by events in the </p><p>West Bank/Gaza, has risen or fallen.  McDonald\'s reports that </p><p>current sales are down 25%, compared to 60% in late April. </p><p>Burger King and Pizza Hut report similar numbers.  (Note: In </p><p>an informal visual survey, we noted that the McDonald\'s and </p><p>Burger King franchises across the street from the University </p><p>of Jordan, site of some of the most vehement anti-U.S. </p><p>demonstrations, appeared to be quite busy.  Similarly, Pizza </p><p>Hut and McDonald\'s restaurants in an upscale Amman </p><p>neighborhood, which were nearly empty in late spring, were </p><p>much busier last week.  End note.)  Coca Cola and Pepsi </p><p>report that soft drink sales are down about 40 percent from </p><p>last year, although local stores say there has been a slight </p><p>upturn recently.  An influx of low-priced Syrian soft drink </p><p>products (REF A), in an effort to take advantage of the </p><p>boycott, has served as a politically-expedient substitute and </p><p>has prolonged the slump. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ANTI-BOYCOTT EFFORTS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The GOJ has intervened at a number of levels to </p><p>discourage the boycott.  PM Abul Ragheb has prodded local </p><p>opinion leaders and NGOs to deter calls for a boycott, and </p><p>government officials have interceded with mosques to drop </p><p>anti-U.S., pro-boycott preaching.  Minister of the Interior </p><p>Majali stated publicly that the boycott would "damage </p><p>Jordan\'s interests and relationships with friendly countries" </p><p>and would  "jeopardize vital financial assistance".  A </p><p>Ministry of Industry and Trade official told Emboffs that </p><p>Minister Bashir has spoken out against the campaign.  Last </p><p>week, the GOJ banned a planned rally by professional </p><p>associations to promote a national boycott. Finally, Coca </p><p>Cola GM Azem Yousef told us that at a ceremony celebrating </p><p>the donation of computers by Coke to a Jordanian school, </p><p>Minister of Education Touqan told teachers to stop </p><p>"glorifying" the boycott, and that ending such talk has </p><p>become a Ministry directive. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The local AmCham, meanwhile, is constructing a </p><p>proactive strategy to reduce the allure of boycott calls over </p><p>the long term.  In addition to placing reactive op-eds </p><p>opposing the boycott, the AmCham is working with local </p><p>journalists to educate them on the economic and job costs of </p><p>the boycott to Jordan.  More significantly, they are working </p><p>with local media and U.S. company reps on a broad press </p><p>strategy to highlight what American companies (as represented </p><p>by Jordanian licensees) are doing to help local communities. </p><p>This includes the Computers in the Classroom project by Coca </p><p>Cola, Microsoft\'s assistance to Jordanian universities, and </p><p>CitiBank\'s programs to educate underprivileged Jordanian </p><p>girls and provide microfinancing to rural women.  The AmCham </p><p>hopes that by highlighting good corporate citizenship over </p><p>the long run, they will create a constituency that actually </p><p>supports U.S. businesses in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>SURVEY SAYS . . . </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) A survey recently conducted by Coca Cola Jordan </p><p>shows both positive and negative trends in Jordanian </p><p>attitudes towards the boycott. The survey canvassed 1200 </p><p>adults throughout the Kingdom to gauge awareness of and </p><p>attitudes toward the boycott. </p><p>6.  (SBU) On the positive side, while 45 percent of the </p><p>respondents are serious about the boycott, only 17 percent </p><p>are committed to maintaining it indefinitely.  What\'s more, </p><p>63 percent think Jordanian consumers are still buying </p><p>American products.  The survey indicates the products singled </p><p>out are mainly fast foods, cigarettes, and soft drinks; </p><p>American computer software, for example, rarely makes the </p><p>list.  Word of mouth on "the street", rather than any </p><p>organized party-driven or Internet-led campaign, accounted </p><p>for the source of most boycotters\' information. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Despite these positive indicators, the survey </p><p>exposed more disturbing trends over the long term.  For </p><p>example, it said that 63 percent of those surveyed said the </p><p>boycott should include Jordanian companies that carried </p><p>American brands.  More worrying, respondents were split down </p><p>the middle about whether Jordanian companies should be </p><p>targeted even if it hurts the Jordanian workforce, suggesting </p><p>that efforts to link the boycott to a negative impact on the </p><p>local economy may not be successful.  Regarding soft drinks </p><p>specifically, 52 percent said that they were not buying </p><p>American brands because of perceived company support for </p><p>Israel.  While this group could not specify the form such </p><p>support might take, it is significant that the companies </p><p>themselves were perceived as policy players, however </p><p>indirectly. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The views expressed by respondents in the Coke </p><p>survey suggests that warnings that the boycott harms </p><p>Jordanian interests may well be immaterial and that the urge </p><p>to make a moral statement, however economically </p><p>insignificant, takes precedence.  These  trends point to a </p><p>wider phenomenon in which Jordanians across the economic </p><p>spectrum feel themselves more politically empowered on a </p><p>personal level by avoiding American products.  Such trends </p><p>could in turn have significant consequences to our long-term </p><p>efforts to promote both economic openness and political </p><p>moderation in Jordan. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
