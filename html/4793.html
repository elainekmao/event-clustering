<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002838 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC-ANC CONTACTS ON ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2829 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  According to a senior MDC parliamentarian, the ANC </p><p>has agreed to a ZANU-PF plan for Zimbabwean Speaker of </p><p>Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa to replace Robert Mugabe, while </p><p>offering token reprentation to the opposition.  MDC leader </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai was briefed on this initiative, which </p><p>likely prompted his December 18 statement condemning South </p><p>Africa and Britain.  The retired Rhodesian Colonel named in </p><p>the statement admitted being sent as an emissary to </p><p>Tsvangirai by Mnangagwa and defense forces chief Vitalis </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Zvinavashe, a particularly interesting development if Mugabe </p><p>was unaware of this overture.  Meanwhile, Father Fidelis </p><p>Mukonori\'s efforts to broker a Mugabe-Tsvangirai dialogue are </p><p>at an embryonic stage, but both sides appear willing to </p><p>engage in such an effort given the provision of unspecified </p><p>guarantees from the other.  The MDC no longer believes South </p><p>Africa will play a fair broker role on Zimbabwe and has told </p><p>Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon in a letter that </p><p>Pretoria has "repudiated its membership in the Troika" by its </p><p>demonstrated partiality toward the "illegitimate Mugabe </p><p>regime."      End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>ANC-ZANU-PF plan on the way forward </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Reftel reported issuance of a statement by Movement </p><p>for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai accusing </p><p>Britain, South Africa, and elements of ZANU-PF of conspiring </p><p>to keep the ruling party in power after Robert Mugabe\'s </p><p>departure from office.  We subsequently received a report of </p><p>two recent meetings held in South Africa between MDC </p><p>parliamentarian (and shadow justice minister) David Coltart </p><p>and Patrick Moseki, described to us as a senior ANC official, </p><p>which might shed additional light on the motivations for </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s statement. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  According to Coltart\'s report, Coltart and Moseki </p><p>first met in South Africa on December 8.  Moseki reportedly </p><p>explained that Thabo Mbeki was facing growing criticism from </p><p>within the ANC and its coalition partners for not doing </p><p>enough to make the South African economy more equitable.  He </p><p>implied that Mbeki was consumed predominantly with </p><p>consolidating his political position, and that his views on </p><p>Zimbabwe should be considered in that light.  Coltart replied </p><p>with a description of the dramatic economic decline and the </p><p>famine in Zimbabwe, and made it clear that the resulting </p><p>tensions could soon erupt if the underlying political crisis </p><p>were not soon resolved.  He reiterated the MDC\'s proposal on </p><p>a way forward -- Mugabe\'s retirement followed by </p><p>establishment of a transitional authority which would restore </p><p>some degree of political and economic stability and pave the </p><p>way for a new, internationally-supervised presidential </p><p>election.  Coltart acknowledged that a transitional authority </p><p>would have to grant some sort of amnesty to Mugabe and his </p><p>senior officials, and that the international community would </p><p>have to be prepared to offer safe passage.  Moseki replied </p><p>that Zimbabwean Speaker of Parliament (and long Mugabe\'s heir </p><p>apparent) Emmerson Mnangagwa was in South Africa attempting </p><p>to sell the ANC a leadership succession plan which excluded </p><p>the MDC.  Moseki said he would meet Mnangagwa the following </p><p>day and report back to Coltart. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  On December 9, Moseki and Coltart met again.  Moseki </p><p>said he had been part of an ANC delegation which had met for </p><p>most of that day with Mnangagwa.  The Zimbabwean Speaker had </p><p>laid out ZANU-PF\'s plan of action, which Moseki implied the </p><p>ANC had bought into : </p><p> </p><p>--Mugabe would serve out his term, which expires in 2008 but </p><p>would soon appoint Mnangagwa Prime Minister and gradually </p><p>turn over most executive functions to him; </p><p> </p><p>--Mnangagwa would offer a token number of Cabinet positions </p><p>to the MDC (he suggested two seats but was urged by some of </p><p>his ANC interlocutors to increase that number to five); </p><p> </p><p>--If the MDC opted not to go along with this plan, it would </p><p>be crushed ruthlessly; </p><p> </p><p>--ZANU-PF would implement the plan regardless of what the </p><p>international community thought of it or Mnangagwa. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment:  We know that Morgan Tsvangirai has been </p><p>briefed on the above discussions, which could have prompted </p><p>him to issue his December 19 statement accusing South Africa </p><p>of collaborating with ZANU-PF to ensure the latter\'s </p><p>continued hold on power.  The warm reception accorded </p><p>Mnangagwa at the ANC congress could have been another factor </p><p>in Tsvangirai\'s decision to issue such a strong condemnation </p><p>of the South Africans.  The MDC leadership has come to the </p><p>conclusion, over the past several months, that the South </p><p>African government will not play a fair broker role on </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Tsvangirai has written to Commonwealth </p><p>Secretary-General Don McKinnon stating that the MDC would </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>find it "extremely difficult" to continue to participate in a </p><p>Commonwealth Troika process which involves South Africa.  In </p><p>the letter, a copy of which has been faxed to AF/S, </p><p>Tsvangirai writes:  "We are convinced that through its </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>duplicity, South Africa has repudiated its membership in the </p><p>Troika.  Pretoria has totally distanced itself from any </p><p>attempt to evaluate the Zimbabwe crisis impartially and </p><p>objectively.  It can only meaningfully participate in the </p><p>Troika deliberations not as an honest broker, but as an open </p><p>and self-confessed representative of the illegitimate Mugabe </p><p>regime." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Father Fidelis keeps at it </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Meanwhile, Father Fidelis Mukonori is continuing his </p><p>efforts to arrange a Mugabe-Tsvangirai dialogue.  In a </p><p>meeting with Tsvangirai advisor Gandi Mudzingwa on December </p><p>19, Father Fidelis said Mugabe had told him that the MDC </p><p>leader had as much of a right as any Zimbabwean to govern </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Mugabe, however, expressed concerns about the </p><p>MDC\'s pending court challenge of the presidential election </p><p>results and about some in the MDC who were more interested in </p><p>seeking retribution than moving forward.  Mudzingwa told us </p><p>it was apparent from his conversation with Father Fidelis </p><p>that Mugabe wants certain guarantees, most likely immunity </p><p>from prosecution for past misdeeds.  Asked whether Mugabe </p><p>would trust Tsvangirai was capable of delivering such a </p><p>guarantee, Mudzingwa told us that was an issue to be worked </p><p>out in an inter-party dialogue.  In his conversation with </p><p>Mudzingwa, Father Fidelis was apparently  dismissive of </p><p>Emmerson Mnangagwa, calling him a "small boy."  Father </p><p>Fidelis was due to follow up with Tsvangirai in a meeting </p><p>scheduled for December 19.  (Comment: This initiative is </p><p>clearly in its embryonic stages and it is unclear whether it </p><p>will lead anywhere.  Mudzingwa was pleasantly surprised by </p><p>Mugabe\'s reported comment regarding Tsvangirai, and said </p><p>dropping the court case was not out of the question provided </p><p>significant concessions were agreed first by the other side. </p><p>Father Fidelis told us separately that no meeting would occur </p><p>this year and until the election court case was resolved. </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>British in cahoots with Mnangagwa? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Tsvangirai told the Ambassador on December 17 that he </p><p>had learned of efforts by the British Government to convince </p><p>the editor of the independent "Daily News" to soften its </p><p>regular criticism of Emmerson Mnangagwa.  He said he also </p><p>knew that retired Colonel Lionel Dyck -- who was head of the </p><p>Rhodesian military\'s parachute regiment and now runs an </p><p>international demining company -- was working with Mnangagwa </p><p>and General Vitalis Zvinavashe, Chairman of the Defense </p><p>Forces, to find a solution to Zimbabwe\'s political crisis. </p><p>(Comment: Tsvangirai clearly assumed these two developments </p><p>were related, and appears to have concluded that the British </p><p>government believed Mnangagwa\'s replacement of Mugabe was the </p><p>best way of restoring political stability to Zimbabwe and </p><p>that they were working together to effect that outcome.  End </p><p>Comment.) In response to a journalist\'s question, Dyck </p><p>acknowledged meeting with Tsvangirai as an emissary of </p><p>Mnangagwa and Zvinavashe.  "I would like to see peaceful </p><p>change in Zimbabwe," he said, "and, as such, the vehicle of </p><p>ZANU-PF should be used as part of a transition to peaceful </p><p>change." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) As we concluded in reftel, Tsvangirai was concerned </p><p>about being squeezed into accepting a political settlement in </p><p>which he and the MDC were given only token representation in </p><p>an Mnangagwa-led government.  He apparently concluded that </p><p>exposing his suspicions publicly was the best way of warding </p><p>off such a possibility.  It is not yet clear whether the MDC </p><p>leader\'s vehement condemnations of particular governments and </p><p>individuals burned bridges with some of those -- both </p><p>internally and externally -- most willing to and capable of </p><p>helping extricate Zimbabwe from its cycle of crises.  In </p><p>addition, if Mugabe was not aware of their overture to </p><p>Tsvangirai via Colonel Dyck, Messrs. Mnangagwa and Zvinavashe </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>will have some very deft explaining to do. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
