<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002820 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, EFIN, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Keeping the Lights On in Zimbabwe </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:   The GoZ will need to spend over twice its revenue </p><p>to meet appropriation goals in 2003, according to our </p><p>calculations.  It will react to this bleak predicament by </p><p>printing money, enduring shortages and relinquishing national </p><p>assets. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. In spite of its veneer of transparency, the GoZ does not </p><p>disclose foreign exchange transactions.  This is quite an </p><p>omission, since they now comprise most GoZ spending.  We </p><p>integrated domestic and foreign accounts into the following </p><p>matrix for 2003, converting the domestic transactions into U.S. </p><p>dollars at the present parallel rate of Z$ 1580:1: </p><p> </p><p>EXPENDITURES </p><p> </p><p>a. Critical : </p><p> </p><p>Food Imports             $  140,000,000 </p><p>Fuel Imports             $  330,000,000 </p><p>Energy Imports           $  110,000,000 </p><p>Civil Service Salaries   $  169,000,000 </p><p>Critical Infrastructure  $    26,000,000 </p><p> </p><p>Total Critical Expenditures   $  775,000,000 </p><p> </p><p>b. Ordinary: </p><p> </p><p>Other External Payments  $  426,000,000 </p><p>Budgeted Expenditures    $  293,000,000 </p><p> </p><p>Total Ordinary Expenditures   $  719,000,000 </p><p> </p><p>Total Expenditures            $1,494,000,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REVENUE </p><p> </p><p>Foreign Exchange Inflows      $  350,000,000 </p><p>Tax Revenues                  $  342,000,000 </p><p>Privatizations                $    13,000,000 </p><p> </p><p>Total Revenue                 $ 705,000,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHORTFALL                     $ (789,000,000) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  A few notes on our methodology: </p><p> </p><p>a.) We accepted GoZ estimates for domestic expenditure and </p><p>revenue at face value, although past years have shown that </p><p>overruns are common. </p><p> </p><p>b) For foreign accounts, we relied on industry estimates as well </p><p>as an internal Reserve Bank working paper of Oct  4. </p><p> </p><p>c) Due to the high political cost of reductions, we counted civil </p><p>service salaries and benefits as a critical expenditure. </p><p> </p><p>d) Critical infrastructure includes what it costs to keep air </p><p>traffic, police, power stations, etc., in operation. </p><p> </p><p>e) Forex inflows mostly reflect GoZ expectations from a 40 </p><p>percent withholding of export earnings, which is subsequently </p><p>exchanged at the official rate (3 percent of market value). </p><p>After increasing the withholding to 50-100 percent in the 2003 </p><p>budget, the Government now forecasts that revenue will grow while </p><p>most economists believe it will move in the other direction.  We </p><p>left earlier projections unchanged. </p><p> </p><p>f) "Critical" levels of fuel and energy cited above probably </p><p>reflect over-consumption at controlled or subsidized prices. </p><p>Fuel is often purchased at Zimbabwe service stations solely for </p><p>resale abroad.   If the GoZ allows these subsidized prices to </p><p>rise toward market-determined levels, demand will fall. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>----------- </p><p>4.  This is a very grim picture.  Still, the many variables make </p><p>it extremely difficult to develop a model that demonstrates what </p><p>Zimbabwe must spend each day or month to forestall economic </p><p>meltdown.  The GoZ will have to make a number of unpleasant </p><p>decisions during 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5. We do not see any way the GoZ could begin again to service </p><p>external debt next year, in spite of Finance Minister Murerwa\'s </p><p>budget statements that Zimbabwe "cannot continue to default on </p><p>[its] external debt commitments . . .  [and the Government is] </p><p>determined to initiate a </p><p>credible program to reduce these arrears."   We expect the GoZ to </p><p>expand money supply aggressively and spend substantially less on </p><p>food, fuel and energy imports that it would like.  Although </p><p>shedding more public assets in garage-sale fashion would be a </p><p>blow to national pride, perhaps even more so than an orderly </p><p>privatization with foreign bidders, the GoZ may decide that this </p><p>is the only way to stave off unbearable shortages.  The GoZ has </p><p>already reportedly exchanged assets with Libya for oil, and the </p><p>internal Reserve Bank document suggests the GoZ may need to lease </p><p>or sell Air Zimbabwe\'s planes as a potential source of revenue. </p><p>(An executive from a U.S. ground support equipment supplier </p><p>believes equity in Air Zimbabwe\'s 2 767s and 3 737s would be </p><p>worth US$ 260 million in the open market.)   Perhaps the GoZ\'s </p><p>only consolation may be that even subsidized energy consumption </p><p>should fall in an economy that is deindustrializing. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
