THE UNITED </p><p>STATES SUBMITTED ITS RESERVATION IN WRITING (ALONG WITH A </p><p>REQUEST THAT THE RESERVATION BE PLACED AS A FOOTNOTE TO </p><p>OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH 10 OF THE DECLARATION.)

CONCERNING OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH 10, WE ARE </p><p>COMMITTED TO CONCRETE ACTION TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES OF THE </p><p>WORLD FOOD SUMMIT, AND ARE CONCERNED THAT STERILE DEBATE </p><p>OVER "VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES" WOULD DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM </p><p>THE REAL WORK OF REDUCING POVERTY AND HUNGER." </p><p> </p><p>WFS5YL PLENARY STATEMENTS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. THE U.S. PLENARY STATEMENT, DELIVERED BY SECRETARY </p><p>VENEMAN, HIGHLIGHTED U.S. EFFORTS TO IMPROVE AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PRODUCTIVITY, NUTRITION AND COMBAT FAMINE, INCLUDING THROUGH </p><p>SCHOOL FEEDING AND  EMERGENCY FOOD AID (WITH SPECIAL </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA).  THE DEVASTATING </p><p>IMPACT OF HIV/AIDS ON FOOD SECURITY WAS STRESSED.  THE </p><p>SECRETARY ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S. WOULD HOST A </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MINISTERIAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IN EARLY 2003 </p><p>TO FOCUS ON HOW DEVELOPING COUNTRIES\' FOOD NEEDS CAN BE MET </p><p>THROUGH NEW FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGIES.

PLENARY STATEMENTS DID NOT ATTRACT A LARGE AUDIENCE, BUT </p><p>THE STATEMENT OF ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT MUGABE -- WHO TOUTED </p><p>HIS LAND RESETTLEMENT SCHEME AS CONTRIBUTING TO FOOD </p><p>SECURITY -- WAS MUCH REMARKED ON IN THE CORRIDORS.  AN NGO </p><p>SPEAKER WHOSE TURN AT THE PODIUM CAME LATE IN THE EVENING OF </p><p>JUNE 12 CAUSED COMMENT AS WELL BY RIPPING UP THE WFS5YL </p><p>DECLARATION AND  EATING IT TO EXPRESS HIS DISSATISFACTION </p><p>WITH THE DOCUMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WFS5YL SIDE EVENTS -- REGIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>"PROJECT EXCHANGE" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN A LAST MINUTE EFFORT TO MOBILIZE FUNDING FOR </p><p>PROJECTS, THE FAO ORGANIZED SOME 20 MEETINGS OF REGIONAL </p><p>ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (SUCH AS MERCOSUR, ECOWAS AND SADC) </p><p>WITH A VIEW TO BRINGING TOGETHER DONORS AND RECIPIENTS TO </p><p>DISCUSS SPECIFIC PROJECT PROPOSALS AT THE REGIONAL AND SUB- </p><p>REGIONAL LEVEL.

THERE WERE MANY </p><p>REPORTS (INCLUDING FROM INSIDE THE SECRETARIAT) OF PROBLEMS </p><p>WITH THE ORGANIZATION AND THE PREPARATION.  COMMENT: ONE </p><p>OECD MEMBER REPORTED THAT THE AFRICAN GROUP (WHICH HAD SENT </p><p>MINISTERS OF AGRICULTURE TO THE SEMINARS), WAS "FURIOUS" AT </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG) DIOUF BECAUSE HE HIMSELF DID NOT </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE AFRICAN SUB-REGIONAL SEMINARS, AND </p><p>BECAUSE THERE WERE FEW OECD DONORS PRESENT.  CURIOUSLY, IN A </p><p>POST-WFS5YL MEETING WITH ACTING PERM REP, THE DG SAID THAT </p><p>HE FELT THE SEMINARS WERE ONE OF THE GREAT SUCCESSES OF THE </p><p>SUMMIT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WFS SIDE EVENTS CONTINUED:  ROUNDTABLES, MULTISTAKEHOLDER </p><p>DIALOGUE -- NGO "DECLARATION" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>8.  THE THREE ROUNDTABLES, WHERE HEADS OF DELEGATION DEBATED </p><p>THE OVERARCHING WFS5YL THEME OF "WFS PLAN OF ACTION: RESULTS </p><p>ACHIEVED, OBSTACLES MET AND MEANS OF OVERCOMING THEM" MET IN </p><p>CLOSED SESSION.

ALMOST ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE DISSATISFIED WITH THE </p><p>MULTISTAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE, WHICH REPRESENTED AN EFFORT TO </p><p>BROADEN THE DISCUSSION OF THE WFS5YL OBJECTIVES BY INCLUDING </p><p>NGO/CSO REPRESENTATIVES.  NGO/CSO PARTICIPANTS SPENT THE </p><p>SESSION LOBBING BROADSIDES AT THE OECD MEMBER COUNTRIES </p><p>(PRIMARILY AGAINST TRADE LIBERALIZATION AND GMO </p><p>"CONTAMINATION.").  MEMBER COUNTRY DELEGATIONS (WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF THE U.S., INDIA, NORWAY, THE EC AND A FEW </p><p>OTHERS) FOR THE MOST PART DID NOT RESPOND.  COMMENT:  THE </p><p>OVERARCHING THEME WHICH HEADS OF DELEGATION USED AS A </p><p>STARTING POINT FOR THE ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION WAS, IN </p><p>RETROSPECT, TOO BROAD TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR MEANINGFUL </p><p>DIALOGUE BETWEEN SOME 100 COUNTRIES AND TWICE THAT NUMBER OF </p><p>NGO\'S.  GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF NGO/CSO\'S IN DELIVERY OF </p><p>FOOD AID AND FOOD ASSISTANCE -- EVEN IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES </p><p>-- MANY DELEGATES WERE FRUSTRATED THAT THE EVENT WAS LESS </p><p>PRODUCTIVE.   THE ABSENCE OF NGO ADVOCACY ON HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ISSUES (OTHER THAN THE RIGHT TO FOOD) WAS ALSO NOTABLE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE FINAL NGO/CSO DECLARATION WAS AN ALMOST COMPLETE </p><p>REBUTTAL OF THE GOVERNMENT-NEGOTIATED "DECLARATION." IN THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03214  03 OF 05  020719Z </p><p>DECLARATION (DISCUSSED REFTEL), DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, HAD ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO TRADE </p><p>LIBERALIZATION; COUNTRIES HAD ALSO AGREED THAT AGRICULTURAL </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE PROMOTED. THE NGO DECLARATION ARGUED </p><p>THAT NUMBER OF HUNGRY WAS NOT REDUCED BECAUSE "GOVERNMENTS </p><p>CONTINUED TO PURSUE POLICIES THAT LEAD TO HUNGER AND </p><p>POLICIES THAT SUPPORT ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION FOR THE SOUTH" </p><p>AND "IMPOSITION OF INTENSIVE...MODELS OF PRODUCTION" WHICH </p><p>HAD "FOCUSED ON SHORT-TERM PRODUCTIVITY GAINS USING HARMFUL </p><p>TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS GMO\'S."  THE NGO DEMONSTRATIONS THAT </p><p>TOOK PLACE (WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CITY OF ROME) WERE </p><p>PEACEFUL, BUT NOT PARTICULARLY WELL-ATTENDED.  USDEL MEMBERS </p><p>PROVIDED WELL-RECEIVED DAILY BRIEFINGS TO U.S. NGOS/CSOS </p><p>OUTSIDE OF THE FAO. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. SIDE EVENT ON BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>11.

THE WFS5YL HAD A SPECIAL FOCUS ON AFRICA, WHICH IS THE </p><p>REGION THAT HAS SEEN FOOD SECURITY DETERIORATE THE MOST </p><p>(ALTHOUGH THE LARGEST NUMBERS OF UNDERNOURISHED ARE STILL IN </p><p>ASIA). THE FAO HAS BEEN DESIGNATED THE SECRETARIAT FOR THE </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PORTION OF THE NEW ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP FOR </p><p>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD), CONSISTENT WITH NEPAD LEADERS\' </p><p>DECISION TO USE EXISTING MECHANISMS (RATHER THAN CREATE NEW </p><p>STRUCTURES).  THE FAO DRAFTED THE FAO/NEPAD JOINT </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE AFRICA AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (CAADP) </p><p>REPORT, WHICH CALLS FOR INVESTMENT OF USD 240 BILLION IN THE </p><p>AGRICULTURE SECTOR BETWEEN NOW AND 2015 AND IS INTENDED TO </p><p>BE DISCUSSED AT THE G8 SUMMIT IN CANADA.   AFRICAN MINISTERS </p><p>MET IN ROME THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE START OF THE WFS5YL TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE DRAFT CAADP.  COMMENT:  THE FAO/NEPAD PROGRAM </p><p>FOR AFRICA IS PRIMARILY FOCUSSED ON GENERATING EXTERNAL </p><p>RESOURCES AND PUTS SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON CHANNELING RESOURCES </p><p>THROUGH THE FAO\'S SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY (SPFS). </p><p>THE SPFS WAS CREATED IN THE WAKE OF THE  1996 WORLD FOOD </p><p>SUMMIT TO PROMOTE SMALL-SCALE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECTS </p><p>(MANY STAFFED WITH TECHNICIANS FROM OTHER DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES) WORKING ON INCREASING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY. </p><p>A 2002 EVALUATION OF SPFS HAD LITTLE POSITIVE TO SAY ABOUT </p><p>SPFS PROJECT DESIGN OR SUSTAINABILITY.

THE FAO DIRECTOR GENERAL SAW THE WFS5YL AS AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO RENEW POLITICAL COMMITMENT TO THE GOALS OF </p><p>THE 1996 WORLD FOOD SUMMIT AND MOBILIZE RESOURCES ON BEHALF </p><p>OF THE WORLD\'S HUNGRY.  WHILE OECD DONORS HAD LONG WARNED </p><p>HIM THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE A "PLEDGING CONFERENCE," THE DG\'S </p><p>"PROJECT EXCHANGE" AS WELL AS THE ROLL-OUT OF THE FAO\'S USD </p><p>24 BILLION "ANTI-HUNGER INITIATIVE" WERE CLEARLY EFFORTS TO </p><p>MOBILIZE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR AGRICULTURE -- ESPECIALLY </p><p>FOR FAO PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR FOOD </p><p>SECURITY (SPFS). </p><p> </p><p>16.

TO THIS END, HE HAS ALREADY EMBARKED ON BILATERAL </p><p>MEETINGS WITH DONOR COUNTRIES REPRESENTATIVES IN ROME (AND </p><p>ABROAD) TO PURSUE THIS AGENDA AND CONTINUE TO SEEK TO </p><p>MOBILIZE NEW RESOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>...AND THE VIEW FROM THE FAO STAFFERS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  THE EVENT -- MEASURED IN EXPENSE AND DISRUPTION OF </p><p>STAFF WORK -- WAS NOT PARTICULARLY FRUITFUL FOR MOST FAO </p><p>STAFFERS.  THEY ARE RELIEVED IT IS OVER, BUT DISAPPOINTED </p><p>WITH THE RESULTS (PARTICULARLY THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE </p><p>"WORLD-STARVES-WHILE-DELEGATES-EAT" GENRE).  FAO STAFFERS </p><p>PREPARING FOR THE WFS5YL ALSO BORE THE BRUNT OF THE DG\'S </p><p>HIGHLY CENTRALIZED AND LAST-MINUTE DECISION MAKING STYLE. </p><p> </p><p>WFS5YL RESULTS -- ITALY AND THE FAO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>18.  WHILE ITALY ROYALLY BANKROLLED THE WFS5YL (FINAL </p><p>FIGURES ARE NOT YET KNOWN), NO ONE WAS MORE SURPRISED THAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03214  05 OF 05  020719Z </p><p>FAO DIRECTOR GENERAL DIOUF WHEN ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BERLUSCONI, IN HIS CONCLUDING REMARKS, STATED THAT THE FAO </p><p>NEEDED TO GO ON A DIET AND TRIM 30 PERCENT -- JUST LIKE HIS </p><p>COMPANIES.  A VISIBLY DISTRESSED DIOUF PASSED A NOTE TO THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER, WHO, AFTER READING IT, TOLD THE AUDIENCE </p><p>THAT HE HAD JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT THE FAO HAD, IN FACT, </p><p>BEEN REDUCING.  A WEEK LATER THE ITALIAN SUPPLEMENT TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE PUBLISHED AN OP-ED BY ITALIAN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIAN DARIO RIVOLTA COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FAO\'S </p><p>WASTE AND INEFFICIENCY AND THE "FAILURE OF FAO\'S CURRENT </p><p>MANAGEMENT" WHICH, "WITH A BILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY </p><p>SECURITY FOR THEIR FUTURE, [IS] NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE." </p><p> </p><p>NEXT STOP JOHANNESBURG -- VIEWS OF ROME GENEVA GROUP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>19.  IN A TOUR-DE-TABLE OF GENEVA GROUP (MAJOR DONORS) </p><p>MEMBERS AFTER THE WFS5YL, THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT </p><p>THE WORLD BANK PRESENTATION ON RURAL DEVELOPMENT WAS THE </p><p>BEST CONCEIVED AND MOST SUBSTANTIVE PRESENTATION OF THE </p><p>WFS5YL.  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING LOW EXPECTATIONS FROM THE </p><p>OUTSET, A NUMBER OF GENEVA GROUP MEMBERS ALSO EXPRESSED </p><p>SATISFACTION WITH THE PRESS COVERAGE OF THE EVENT AND </p><p>GENERAL AWARENESS RAISING OF THE PROBLEMS OF HUNGER.  EU </p><p>GENEVA GROUP MEMBERS ALSO OPINED THAT WORLD SUMMIT ON </p><p>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (WSSD) SHOULD MAKE A MORE </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE CONTRIBUTION IN THE AREA OF AGRICULTURE </p><p>(ALTHOUGH THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE CURRENT WSSD AGRICULTURE </p><p>SECTION IS WEAK). (COMMENT: THE CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE IN THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT, RATHER THAN THE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03214  05 OF 05  020719Z </p><p>GENERAL COMMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p>20. COMPARED TO OTHER OECD MEMBER COUNTRIES, OUR IMPRESSION </p><p>OF THE SUMMIT APPEARS SLIGHTLY MORE POSITIVE, POSSIBLY </p><p>REFLECTING THE FACT THAT THE U.S. CAME TO THE WFS5YL WITH </p><p>NEW INITIATIVES AND A RENEWED FOCUS ON AGRICULTURE.  WE WERE </p><p>THUS ABLE TO STAGE SUCCESSFUL SIDE-EVENTS AND ENGAGE IN </p><p>PRODUCTIVE BILATERAL MEETINGS.  THE PRESS FOCUS ON TRADE </p><p>ISSUES FREQUENTLY UPSTAGED THE DEVELOPMENT MESSAGE, BUT ALSO </p><p>PROVIDED U.S. PRINCIPALS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO </p><p>CRITICISMS OF THE U.S. FARM BILL.  AS FOR DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>DIOUF, HIS INABILITY TO MUSTER NEW RESOURCES DIRECTLY FOR </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES MAY UNDERCUT HIS SUPPORT AMONG THOSE </p><p>COUNTRIES, AND MAY IMPACT PROSPECTS FOR A RUN AT A THIRD SIX- </p><p>YEAR TERM.
