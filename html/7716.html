<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 000950 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR/SCE NYSTROM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, EFIN, SI, BK, MK, SR, HK </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA WILL NOT ACCEPT TRANSFER OF NBY FUNDS </p><p></p><p>REF: STATE 99664 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLECON COUNSELOR NICHOLAS HILL, FOR REASONS 1.5 (B AND </p><p>D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON APRIL 29, WE MET WITH MIROSLAV KOVACIC, HEAD OF </p><p>THE AMERICAS DEPARTMENT AT THE MFA, AT HIS REQUEST.  KOVACIC </p><p>SAID THE MINISTRY HAD HEARD FROM THE CROATIAN NATIONAL BANK </p><p>(CNB) THAT IT HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO ACCEPT A TRANSFER OF </p><p>$54.6 MILLION AS CROATIA\'S PART OF UNFROZEN NBY ASSETS IN THE </p><p>U.S.  KOVACIC REFERRED BACK TO OUR DEMARCHES OVER THE LAST </p><p>SEVERAL MONTHS, WHICH HAD DESCRIBED A PROCESS IN WHICH, IF </p><p>THE USG DID NOT RECEIVE HOLD HARMLESS ASSURANCES FROM ALL </p><p>PARTIES, THE USG WOULD PROCEED WITH A GENERAL UNBLOCKING. </p><p>KOVACIC ASKED FOR CONFIRMATION THAT THE TELEX FROM THE </p><p>FEDERAL RESERVE BANK IN NEW YORK DID INDEED INDICATE THAT THE </p><p>USG HAD DECIDED TO DISBURSE THE MONEY TO EACH SUCCESSOR STATE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) USING REFTEL POINTS, WE CONFIRMED THAT THE USG HAD </p><p>DECIDED THAT TRANSFERRING THE FUNDS DIRECTLY TO EACH </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAY TO </p><p>GET THE ASSETS TO THE SUCCESSOR COUNTRIES.  WE STRESSED THAT </p><p>WE WOULD BE CONCERNED IF CROATIA TOOK ANY LEGAL STEPS THAT </p><p>WOULD INTERFERE WITH THIS EFFORT TO RESOLVE ISSUES LEFT OVER </p><p>FROM THE MILOSEVIC ERA.  FINALLY, WE BELIEVED THAT THE ISSUE </p><p>OF NBY ASSETS FROZEN IN THE US UNDER MILOSEVIC-ERA SANCTIONS </p><p>AND THE AGREEMENT ON SUCCESSION ISSUES (ASI) SHOULD BE </p><p>HANDLED SEPARATELY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) KOVACIC COUNTERED THAT GOC LAWYERS SAID THE TWO </p><p>    ISSUES WERE LINKED.  THE GOC COULD NOT ACCEPT THE MONEY, </p><p>BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN ACCEPTING THE KEY OF THE ASI, WHICH </p><p>HAD NOT BEEN RATIFIED BY PARLIAMENT.  HE EXPRESSED HIS </p><p>STRONG, PERSONAL DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THIS OUTCOME WAS NOT IN </p><p>LINE WITH WHAT THE USG HAD TOLD THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p>KOVACIC SAID CROATIA HAD BEEN VERY HOPEFUL WHEN THE USG </p><p>OFFERED ASSISTANCE TO HELP OBTAIN AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAD </p><p>HAPPENED TO THE NBY DEPOSITS -- AN OFFER THAT SEEMED TO </p><p>DISAPPEAR SUDDENLY AFTER AN OFAC VISIT TO ZAGREB AND BELGRADE </p><p>IN DECEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WE EXPLAINED THAT THE OFFER WAS RESCINDED AFTER </p><p>OFFICIAL VISITORS TO CROATIA, DISMAYED BY THE HARD LINE TAKEN </p><p>BY CROATIAN INTERLOCUTORS, CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT </p><p>CROATIA WAS NOT LOOKING FOR AN EXPLANATION THAT WOULD SMOOTH </p><p>THE WAY TO RATIFICATION OF THE ASI, BUT RATHER FURTHER </p><p>REASONS TO BE INTRANSIGENT AND TO DEMAND COMPENSATION.  WE </p><p>REITERATED THAT IT WOULD BE UNWISE FOR CROATIA TO TRY TO </p><p>BRING A COURT CASE AGAINST THE USG OVER THIS ISSUE.  KOVACIC </p><p>SAID IT WAS TOO EARLY TO SAY, BUT IT MIGHT IN THE END BE </p><p>NECESSARY. </p><p>MOON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
