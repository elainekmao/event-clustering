<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002642 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 09/06/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR BULAWAYO MAYORAL VOTE AND TWO BY- </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE VOTERS OF BULAWAYO WILL CHOOSE A NEW MAYOR AND THE </p><p>VOTERS OF MAKONI WEST A NEW MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT SEPTEMBER 8-9, </p><p>WHILE CHIKOMBA WILL CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR TO THE LATE WAR VETERAN </p><p>LEADER CHENJERAI "HITLER" HUNZVI IN A BY-ELECTION SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>SEPTEMBER 22-23.  THE PRE-ELECTION PERIOD HAS BEEN MOSTLY PEACEFUL </p><p>IN BULAWAYO, ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN ACCUSATIONS OF VOTE-BUYING </p><p>AND OF PADDING OF THE VOTERS ROLL.  THE MDC IS EXPECTED TO WIN, </p><p>BUT THE KEY ISSUE IS WHETHER THE OPPOSITION PARTY CAN MAINTAIN ITS </p><p>HUGE MARGIN OF VICTORY FROM THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION </p><p>-- IN WHICH IT WON 160,000 VOTES TO ZANU-PF\'S 20,000 -- AND THUS </p><p>PROJECT A SENSE OF POLITICAL MOMENTUM.  IN MAKONI WEST, LOCATED ON </p><p>THE BORDER BETWEEN THE MDC STRONGHOLD OF MANICALAND PROVINCE AND </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S HEARTLAND OF MASHONALAND EAST, THE RULING PARTY HAS </p><p>EMPLOYED TACTICS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION, ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY </p><p>ON A MORE LIMITED SCALE THAN IN PREVIOUS BY-ELECTIONS IN BINDURA, </p><p>BIKITA WEST, AND MARONDERA.  THE MDC HAS BEEN FORCED TO CONDUCT A </p><p>LOW-KEY DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGN, AND HAD CONSIDERED SEEKING A COURT- </p><p>ORDERED DELAY UNTIL RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.  UNTIL THE </p><p>LAST SEVERAL DAYS, THE CAMPAIGN IN CHIKOMBA HAS BEEN MOSTLY FREE </p><p>OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION, LIKELY BECAUSE HUNZVI WON BY ALMOST </p><p>9,000 VOTES AND ZANU-PF DOES NOT FEEL PARTICULARLY THREATENED </p><p>THERE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>BULAWAYO </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02642  01 OF 02  071102Z </p><p>2.  (C) THE RUN-UP TO THE SEPTEMBER 8-9 BULAWAYO MAYORAL ELECTION </p><p>HAS BEEN MOSTLY PEACEFUL AND THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) HAS BEEN ABLE TO CAMPAIGN FREELY.  ZANU-PF </p><p>POLITICAL COMMISSAR -- AND POLITBURO MEMBER -- SIKHANYISO NDLOVU </p><p>TOLD POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF THAT HE AND FORMER ARMY COMMANDER </p><p>SOLOMON MUJURU HAD ORDERED JOSEPH CHINOTIMBA AND HIS MILITIA TO </p><p>STAY AWAY FROM THE BULAWAYO CAMPAIGN, PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THE </p><p>PARTY\'S USUAL TACTICS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION WOULD ONLY </p><p>BACKFIRE IN MATABELELAND.  THAT SAID, HOWEVER, SENIOR MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) OFFICIALS EXPRESSED CONCERN TO US ABOUT </p><p>TWO TACTICS BEING EMPLOYED BY ZANU-PF IN THE BULAWAYO CAMPAIGN. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MDC VICE-PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA AND ELECTIONS </p><p>DIRECTOR PAUL THEMBA NYATHI, THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE </p><p>VOTERS ROLL IS BEING PADDED WITH ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS, ALTHOUGH THEY </p><p>DID NOT YET HAVE A SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF THAT EFFORT.   THAT </p><p>CONCERN HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT THE VOTERS ROLL HAD </p><p>NOT YET BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE REQUISITE PUBLIC INSPECTION, </p><p>NINE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.  IN ADDITION, RULING PARTY </p><p>HEAVYWEIGHTS SUCH AS INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO, LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT MINISTER IGNATIUS CHOMBO, AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>GENDER, AND EMPLOYMENT CREATION DEPUTY MINISTER SHUVAI MAHOFA ARE </p><p>HANDING OUT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH AT POLITICAL RALLIES.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF WOMEN HAVE BEEN ATTENDING THESE RALLIES AND </p><p>ACCEPTING THE HANDOUTS, IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT IT WILL AFFECT THE </p><p>WAY THEY VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) BOTH ZANU-PF AND THE MDC HAVE CHOSEN AS THEIR CANDIDATES </p><p>TECHNOCRATS WITH LONG RECORDS OF SERVICE TO THE CITY.  THE MDC\'S </p><p>JAPHET NDABENI NCUBE HAS SERVED AS BULAWAYO\'S DIRECTOR OF HOUSING </p><p>FOR 15 YEARS, WHILE GEORGE MLILO FROM ZANU-PF HAS BEEN THE CITY\'S </p><p>WATER ENGINEER OF LONGSTANDING.  ACCORDING TO THEMBA NYATHI, MLILO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02642  01 OF 02  071102Z </p><p>HAS BEEN TRYING TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM ZANU-PF, REGULARLY URGING </p><p>VOTERS AT PUBLIC RALLIES TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR THE CANDIDATE </p><p>OF THEIR CHOOSING, REGARDLESS OF THE PARTY THEY REPRESENT.  MOST </p><p>OBSERVERS AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THE PARTY LABEL WILL CARRY MUCH </p><p>MORE WEIGHT WITH VOTERS THAN THE CREDENTIALS OF THE INDIVIDUAL </p><p>CANDIDATES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) BULAWAYO, WHERE RESIDENTS HAVE LONG BEEN BRUTALIZED AND </p><p>MARGINALIZED BY THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT, IS THE HEART OF MDC </p><p>TERRITORY.  IN THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY WON 160,000 VOTES IN BULAWAYO TO ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>20,000.  FEW OBSERVERS DOUBT THAT THE MDC WILL WIN THE MAYORAL </p><p>RACE, BUT THEY POINT OUT THAT THE KEY ISSUE IS THE MARGIN OF </p><p>VICTORY.  A LARGE MARGIN FOR THE MDC WOULD CREATE A SENSE OF </p><p>MOMENTUM FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2002 AND LIKELY WILL </p><p>EMBOLDEN NERVOUS MDC SUPPORTERS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO </p><p>COME OUT ON PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DAY.  A MARGIN SMALLER THAN THAT </p><p>WHICH OBTAINED IN JUNE 2000 WOULD PROVIDE AMMUNITION FOR ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>CONTENTION THAT IT HAS MADE INROADS IN URBAN AREAS SINCE THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY VOTE.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT BULAWAYO IS AN </p><p>EXPECTATIONS GAME, AND A SMALLER THAN EXPECTED VICTORY FOR THE MDC </p><p>WILL BE SPUN BY THE RULING PARTY AS A SIGN OF ITS IMPROVED </p><p>POLITICAL FORTUNES.  THEMBA NYATHI ADMITTED AS MUCH WHEN HE TOLD </p><p>US THAT THE MDC\'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN BULAWAYO IS OVERCOMING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6014 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02642  02 OF 02  071102Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------1BFD07  071103Z /38 </p><p>P 071048Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9666 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002642 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 09/06/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR BULAWAYO MAYORAL VOTE AND TWO BY- </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>VOTER COMPLACENCY AND GETTING ITS SUPPORTERS TO THE POLLS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02642  02 OF 02  071102Z </p><p> </p><p>MAKONI WEST </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE BY-ELECTION IN MAKONI WEST, ALSO SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>SEPTEMBER 8-9, WILL FILL THE SEAT LEFT VACANT BY THE DEATH OF THE </p><p>LATE MINISTER OF DEFENSE MOVEN MAHACHI.  MAHACHI WON 55% OF THE </p><p>VOTE IN JUNE 2000, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHICH WAY THE </p><p>ELECTION WILL GO THIS TIME.  MAKONI WEST IS LOCATED IN THE </p><p>STRONGLY PRO-MDC MANICALAND PROVINCE, BUT IT IS ON THE BORDER WITH </p><p>MASHONALAND EAST, A ZANU-PF STRONGHOLD. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WE UNDERSTAND FROM SEVERAL SOURCES THAT ZANU-PF\'S WAR </p><p>VETERANS AND PARTY THUGS HAVE ESTABLISHED AT LEAST FIVE BASE CAMPS </p><p>IN THE CONSTITUENCY TO COORDINATE A CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION AGAINST SUSPECTED OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS. TIM SHEEHY, </p><p>WHO WILL HEAD THE EUROPEAN UNION\'S NEW ELECTION SUPPORT UNIT IN </p><p>HARARE, MET WITH A NUMBER OF LOCAL RESIDENTS IN MAKONI WEST ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 5.  DURING HIS VISIT, SHEEHY WAS TOLD BY A PROMINENT </p><p>CLERGYMAN THAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS BECOME MORE VIOLENT IN RECENT </p><p>WEEKS, AND THAT MDC SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS IN THE </p><p>OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF INCIDENTS.  THE HOUSE OF THE CONSTITUENCY\'S </p><p>MDC CHAIRMAN WAS BURNED DOWN, MANY RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN FORCED BY </p><p>WAR VETERANS TO ATTEND ALL-NIGHT POLITICAL RALLIES, AND TEACHERS </p><p>AT SOME SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN THREATENED WITH PHYSICAL HARM FOR </p><p>ALLEGEDLY SUPPORTING THE OPPOSITION.  THE CLERGYMAN ALSO EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT POSSIBLE PADDING OF THE VOTERS ROLL, NOTING REPORTS </p><p>THAT VOTERS CONTINUE TO BE REGISTERED, LONG AFTER THE LEGAL PERIOD </p><p>FOR DOING SO ENDED.  IN ITS WRITTEN PRE-ELECTION REPORT, THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE ELECTION SUPPORT NETWORK -- WHICH PROVIDES DOMESTIC </p><p>MONITORS AT ALL POLLING STATIONS -- DESCRIBED THE CONSTITUENCY AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02642  02 OF 02  071102Z </p><p>"TENSE, WITH REPORTS THAT INTIMIDATION AND VOTE-BUYING ARE RIFE." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MDC ELECTIONS DIRECTOR THEMBA-NYATHI TOLD US THAT, AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THE CLIMATE OF INTIMIDATION, HIS PARTY HAS HAD TO </p><p>CONDUCT A LOW-KEY DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGN.  THE MDC LEADERSHIP HAD </p><p>CONSIDERED ASKING THE COURT TO DELAY THE ELECTION INDEFINITELY, </p><p>UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE RULE OF LAW WAS RESTORED, BUT ULTIMATELY </p><p>DECIDED AGAINST THAT COURSE OF ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>CHIKOMBA </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) A SECOND BY-ELECTION IS SCHEDULED IN THE MASHONALAND EAST </p><p>CONSTITUENCY OF CHIKOMBA SEPTEMBER 22-33 TO FILL THE SEAT LEFT </p><p>VACANT BY LATE WAR VETERAN LEADER CHENJERAI "HITLER" HUNZVI. </p><p>SINCE HUNZVI WON 65 PERCENT OF THE BALLOTS CAST -- BY 7,000 VOTES </p><p>-- IN JUNE 2000.  GIVEN THAT MARGIN OF VICTORY AND CHIKOMBA\'S </p><p>LOCATION IN THE ZANU-PF HEARTLAND OF MASHONALAND EAST, THE RULING </p><p>PARTY LIKELY WILL RETAIN THIS SEAT.  THE CAMPAIGN HAS, </p><p>SURPRISINGLY, BEEN MOSTLY PEACEFUL, THANKS TO THE INSISTENCE BY </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN THAT HE WOULD NOT TOLERATE THE </p><p>TACTICS USED BY THE PARTY IN OTHER BY-ELECTIONS.  IN ADDITION, WE </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT HUNZVI\'S PREDECESSOR IN CHIKOMBA, SOLOMON MUJURU </p><p>-- WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE RULING PARTY POLITBURO AND A RETIRED ARMY </p><p>COMMANDER WHO RETAINS THE LOYALTIES OF MANY ACTIVE DUTY OFFICERS </p><p>-- HAS BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES TO ENSURE THAT THE PRE- </p><p>ELECTION PERIOD IS PEACEFUL.  ZANU-PF COULD HAVE COME TO THE </p><p>CONCLUSION THAT IT HAD CHIKOMBA IN THE BAG SO IT COULD AFFORD TO RUN A </p><p>PEACEFUL CAMPAIGN.  DURING THE PAST WEEK, HOWEVER, WE HAVE HEARD </p><p>REPORTS OF SOME VIOLENT CLASHES BETWEEN MDC AND ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02642  02 OF 02  071102Z </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVATION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) EMBASSY OFFICERS PLAN TO OBSERVE ALL THREE ELECTIONS AND </p><p>ARE COORDINATING OUR EFFORTS WITH OTHER DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
