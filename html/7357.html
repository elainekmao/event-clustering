<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000668 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VISIT TO KWARA STATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 404 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Poloff traveled to the Kwara State capital </p><p>of Ilorin on March 17 and met with officials from the </p><p>People\'s Democratic Party and with the National Democratic </p><p>Party gubernatorial Candidate.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The political situation in Kwara has been extremely </p><p>tense in recent months.  All Nigerian People\'s Party (ANPP) </p><p>Governor Mohammed Lawal, a retired military officer, was </p><p>once a protege of Dr. Abubakar Olusola (Sola) Saraki, the </p><p>perennial strongman of Kwara politics.  Once associates, </p><p>the two men are now bitter enemies.  This personal feud </p><p>also reverberates across the ethnic landscape of the state. </p><p>Saraki is a product of the Hausa/Fulani emirate system.  As </p><p>a member of one of the royal families in Ilorin, Lawal has </p><p>publicly claimed to be a descendant of the maverick Yoruba </p><p>leader who pulled Ilorin away from the crumbling Oyo </p><p>(Yoruba) Empire centuries ago.  Lawal is seeking </p><p>reelection.  Saraki is promoting his own son, Bukola, for </p><p>the seat.  The history between Saraki and Lawal, and the </p><p>fact that Bukola is his father\'s proxy, has spoiled the </p><p>political atmosphere, making for a tense, often violent, </p><p>campaign.  Saraki the elder and younger left the ANPP after </p><p>Lawal\'s ascent to governor, and joined the People\'s </p><p>Democratic Party (PDP). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) One of the issues behind the conflict is the naming </p><p>of traditional rulers.  Lawal has promoted more than twenty </p><p>Yoruba traditional rulers, vowing to "return the lost </p><p>status of the Yoruba."  Additionally, court challenges to </p><p>the nomination of title-holders in the Ilorin Emirate have </p><p>come from both Lawal and Ilorin Emir Gambari (a Saraki </p><p>supporter and brother of Ibrahim Gambari, Foreign Minister </p><p>during the Buhari Administration, Nigeria\'s longest-serving </p><p>UN Permanent Representative, and now Under Secretary for </p><p>Africa and the United Nations), with each seeking to limit </p><p>the influence of the other.  The fallout between Saraki and </p><p>Lawal has created a real showdown in the state.  Will </p><p>Saraki continue to orchestrate politics in the state or </p><p>will Lawal replace him as the big man, becoming both king </p><p>and kingmaker himself? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Poloff noticed a heightened state of security around </p><p>the residential compounds of the gubernatorial candidates, </p><p>as well as riot police patroling the town.  The Embassy </p><p>vehicle was required to go through three different PDP </p><p>security checkpoints to reach the State Chairman.  The PDP </p><p>representatives made numerous allegations of violence and </p><p>repressive actions taken by members and hired thugs of the </p><p>All Nigerian People\'s Party (the party of the incumbent </p><p>governor).  Accusations ranged from tearing down posters </p><p>and billboards, intimidation and physical assault of </p><p>campaign personnel, and even that the governor himself gave </p><p>the command to shoot PDP campaigners last month on the road </p><p>to Benue State. Driving through town Poloff noted that </p><p>there were many posters for the incumbent governor, and </p><p>also for the Alliance for Democracy (AD) candidate (the </p><p>former Chief of Staff to Lagos State governor, Bola </p><p>Tinubu), but very few for the PDP candidate (in actuality </p><p>we counted as many political ads for the PDP runner-up in </p><p>the party convention). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The NDP candidate denied that any threats had been </p><p>made against him or his party in any way; however, he </p><p>stated  that the ANPP and PDP were simply gunning for each </p><p>in the state capital and that the two parties were doing </p><p>very little in the rest of the state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: Given the contentious nature of politics in </p><p>Kwara, the two main parties are wary and on guard against </p><p>each other.  The personal nature of the contest may make it </p><p>more intense.  Dirty tricks and violence are in the den of </p><p>both parties.  The race literally may be hard-fought and </p><p>hard-won.  Lawal may have the inside track but it will be </p><p>close.  Saraki The Elder is a veteran and very wealthy </p><p>politician and he will use all of his wiles and wealth to </p><p>unseat Lawal, who, in Saraki\'s eyes, has turned out to be </p><p>an ingrate protege.  When asked about election day, PDP </p><p>officials assured Poloff that they would have their own </p><p>security personnel at each polling station, which does not </p><p>bode well for a peaceful Election day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
