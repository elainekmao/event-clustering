<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001358 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, INR/NESA </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  08-04-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINR, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Tiger official, in high profile trip to the </p><p>east, sticks to hard-line stance regarding base </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1344, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by James F. Entwistle, Charge\' d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C) SUMMARY:  S.P. Thamilchelvam, political chief of </p><p>the Tamil Tigers, has reiterated that the group has no </p><p>plans to vacate an unauthorized base it has set up in </p><p>Trincomalee and, indeed, there has been no change in the </p><p>situation on the ground.  Thamilchelvam, who wrapped up </p><p>a long visit to the east on August 4, appears to have </p><p>used the trip to rally support from the important </p><p>eastern Tiger faction on peace process matters.  His </p><p>trip, which is virtually unprecedented for a high-level </p><p>Tiger official, highlights his increasingly prominent </p><p>role in the organization.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) TIGERS STICK TO HARD-LINE:  S.P. Thamilchelvam, </p><p>political chief of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) organization and a close associate of LTTE leader </p><p>V. Prabhakaran, has reiterated that the group has no </p><p>plans to vacate an unauthorized base it has set up in </p><p>Trincomalee District.  In comments posted on the pro- </p><p>LTTE website "TamilNet" on August 1 and reported in the </p><p>Sri Lankan press, Thamilchelvam was quoted as stating </p><p>that the base was located well within a long-standing </p><p>LTTE area of influence.  He added that, in any case, the </p><p>base had been there for many years and was not worth </p><p>bothering about.  These assertions contradict the </p><p>findings of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, "SLMM," </p><p>which has ruled that the base encroaches on government- </p><p>controlled territory and was established only within the </p><p>past year, thus violating the February 2002 ceasefire </p><p>accord (See Reftels).  Poloff contacted the SLMM\'s </p><p>Trincomalee office, which confirmed that as of early </p><p>August 4 LTTE forces still occupied the site. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Norwegian Ambassador Hans Brattskar on August 4 </p><p>confirmed to Charge\' and SFRC staffer Jonah Blank the </p><p>lack of progress on the base.  He said the next step is </p><p>a SLMM ultimatum to the LTTE.  If the LTTE does not </p><p>respond to that ultimatum, the issue would pass into </p><p>Brattskar\'s "facilitator" channel.  Brattskar noted that </p><p>his only "weapon" in that event would be tough talk in </p><p>Kilinochchi. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) VISIT TO THE EAST:  Thamilchelvam made the </p><p>comments regarding the base in the midst of a week-long </p><p>visit to eastern Sri Lanka (he returned to the Wanni on </p><p>August 4).  Observers have commented that the trip is </p><p>virtually unprecedented for a high-level Tiger official </p><p>representing LTTE leader Prabhakaran and the Tigers\' </p><p>headquarters in the Wanni region in north-central Sri </p><p>Lanka.  Jehan Perera, the head of the National Peace </p><p>Council, a local think-tank, told us that to his </p><p>knowledge there has never been such a public trip by a </p><p>high-level Tiger official to the east, though there were </p><p>almost certainly numerous clandestine visits during the </p><p>war years.  Perera commented that based on what he had </p><p>had heard and read on TamilNet it seemed that </p><p>Thamilchelvam was using the trip to brief the important </p><p>eastern faction of the LTTE on the status of the peace </p><p>process.  (Note:  The LTTE is believed to have two major </p><p>factions:  the most important one hails from Jaffna and </p><p>includes much of the senior leadership, including </p><p>Prabhakaran and Thamilchelvam; the other is from the </p><p>east and supplies many recruits for the LTTE\'s military </p><p>forces.)  Perera went on to remark that the briefings </p><p>probably focused on the LTTE\'s next steps in regard to </p><p>the government\'s recent proposal outlining possible </p><p>modalities for forming an interim administration in the </p><p>north/east (see Reftels). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) With respect to the specifics of his visit to </p><p>the east, Thamilchelvam held a slew of rallies, in </p><p>addition to holding meetings with top LTTE officials in </p><p>the region.  According to press reporting, a sampling of </p><p>Thamilchelvam\'s activities included: </p><p> </p><p>-- On July 27, shortly after arriving in the region, </p><p>Thamilchelvam spoke to a rally attended by thousands of </p><p>LTTE supporters at Meenaham, a LTTE military base </p><p>located approximately 40 kilometers northwest of </p><p>Batticaloa town.  (Note:  Meenaham is believed to be one </p><p>of the Tigers\' major bases in the jungle areas of </p><p>Batticaloa.) </p><p> </p><p>-- On July 27-28, Thamilchelvam held meetings with the </p><p>LTTE\'s eastern commander "Karuna" and other local LTTE </p><p>commanders.  (Note:  There are no reports indicating </p><p>that Thamilchelvam met with "Karikalan," who used to be </p><p>considered a senior LTTE official in Batticaloa, but </p><p>seems to have been sidelined by the LTTE leadership in </p><p>recent months.) </p><p>-- On July 29, Thamilchelvam and Karuna held a joint </p><p>meeting with local NGO\'s working in the Batticaloa area. </p><p> </p><p>-- On August 1, Thamilchelvam traveled to Trincomalee </p><p>District where he met with LTTE district commander </p><p>"Colonel Pathuman" and district political chief </p><p>"Thilak."  The meeting took place in Sampur, a LTTE- </p><p>controlled coastal area located northeast of Mutur town </p><p>and southeast of Trincomalee city. </p><p>(Note:  Norwegian Ambassador Brattskar confirmed that </p><p>Thamilchelvam apparently did not visit the controversial </p><p>military base set up near Trincomalee city mentioned </p><p>above.) </p><p> </p><p>-- On August 2, Thamilchelvam participated in the </p><p>ceremonial opening of a computer training center </p><p>established by the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization </p><p>(TRO), a LTTE-controlled NGO, in the Mutur area.  Later </p><p>that day, Thamilchelvam addressed a large gathering of </p><p>Trincomalee government officials. </p><p> </p><p>-- On August 4 (or thereabouts), Thamilchelvam was </p><p>slated to return via helicopter to LTTE headquarters in </p><p>the Wanni region. </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  In his comings and goings in the east, </p><p>Thamilchelvam has been taken around by a GSL helicopter. </p><p>This has proven controversial, with some strongly anti- </p><p>LTTE elements in the south complaining that the Tigers </p><p>do not warrant such treatment.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  Thamilchelvam\'s remarks on the base in </p><p>Trincomalee indicate that there has been no change in </p><p>the group\'s hard-line stance so far, despite some hopes </p><p>that the LTTE might be reconsidering its position. </p><p>After being very public in its complaints about the LTTE </p><p>over the issue for a couple of weeks, the SLMM has been </p><p>more low-key of late, perhaps hoping that quiet </p><p>diplomacy might lead to a breakthrough. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT (Continued):  Thamilchelvam\'s trip </p><p>highlights his increasingly prominent role in the LTTE </p><p>organization.  In fact, on political issues, </p><p>Thamilchelvam seems almost as important within LTTE </p><p>leadership ranks at this time as the seriously ill Anton </p><p>Balasingham, the group\'s longtime spokesman and chief </p><p>negotiator.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
