REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A NOVEMBER 20 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, SENIOR ZANU- </p><p>PF OFFICIAL NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA SAID THE GOZ WANTS TO MAINTAIN GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE USG, AND HE URGED THAT THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY </p><p>AND RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA), CURRENTLY BEFORE THE HOUSE OF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES, BE TAKEN "OFF THE AGENDA."  THE AMBASSADOR SAID </p><p>CONCRETE IMPROVEMENTS ON OUR ISSUES OF CONCERN -- RESTORATION OF </p><p>THE RULE OF LAW, A REDUCTION IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE, FREE AND FAIR </p><p>ELECTIONS -- ARE ESSENTIAL PRECURSORS TO AN IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH US.  SHAMUYARIRA INSISTED THAT INTERNATIONAL ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVERS WILL BE INVITED AFTER THE ELECTION DATES ARE ANNOUNCED, </p><p>BUT HE STRESSED THAT "LONG-HAIRED SCANDINAVIANS" TRYING TO TEACH </p><p>US ABOUT DEMOCRACY WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THE RULING PARTY IS URGING ITS SUPPORTERS TO CONDUCT A </p><p>PEACEFUL CAMPAIGN, BUT LAMENTED THAT THEY MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>CONTROL IN THE FACE OF PROVOCATIONS FROM THE OPPOSITION MDC.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ZDERA </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03527  01 OF 03  231104Z </p><p>2.  (C) IN A NOVEMBER 20 CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR, ZANU-PF </p><p>ELDER STATESMAN -- AND THE RULING PARTY\'S SECRETARY FOR </p><p>INFORMATION -- NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA FIRST RAISED THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA), CURRENTLY BEFORE THE </p><p>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.  SHAMUYARIRA SAID THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WANTED TO "GET ZDERA OFF THE AGENDA" AND HE THOUGHT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE MIGHT SOON WRITE TO PRESIDENT BUSH EXPRESSING HIS CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT THIS PENDING LEGISLATION.   THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT ZDERA </p><p>WAS AS MUCH AN INCENTIVES BILL AS A SANCTIONS BILL, AND THAT IT </p><p>RECOMMENDS THE IMPOSITION OF TARGETED PERSONAL SANCTIONS IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF PROGRESS ON RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS, AND </p><p>FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS </p><p>WELCOME TO SEND A LETTER BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT CONCRETE ACTIONS </p><p>ADDRESSING THE AREAS OF CONCERN SPECIFIED IN THE BILL WOULD CARRY </p><p>MUCH GREATER WEIGHT WITH THE U.S. CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>U.S.-ZIMBABWE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SHAMUYARIRA SAID THE GOZ WANTS TO KEEP RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>USG "ON AN EVEN KEEL," AS THE UNITED STATES HAS ALWAYS USED ITS </p><p>INFLUENCE IN ZIMBABWE CONSTRUCTIVELY.  HE SAID THE BRITISH ARE </p><p>"AGAINST US" AND HAVE CONVINCED THE EUROPEAN UNION TO TAKE THE </p><p>SAME TACK.  THE GOZ HOPED THE USG WOULD DISTANCE ITSELF FROM THAT </p><p>APPROACH BY DROPPING ZDERA AND BY MAKING A GESTURE TOWARD MUGABE. </p><p>(NOTE: HE DID NOT ELABORATE ON WHAT KIND OF GESTURE MIGHT BE </p><p>HELPFUL.  END NOTE.)  HE URGED THAT PRESIDENT BUSH "PLEASE, </p><p>PLEASE" NOT PURSUE A CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE, AS IT WOULD NOT BE PRODUCTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR SAID POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND RULE OF LAW ARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03527  01 OF 03  231104Z </p><p>MAJOR ISSUES FOR THE UNITED STATES, AND PROGRESS OR LACK OF </p><p>PROGRESS ON THOSE FRONTS WOULD BE KEY DETERMINANTS OF OUR </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS </p><p>MAINTAIN OPEN CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION, BUT HE SAID HE WANTED TO </p><p>MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR THE UNITED </p><p>STATES IS TO SEE CONCRETE IMPROVEMENTS ON THE GROUND. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS DETERIORATED SINCE </p><p>THE MID-OCTOBER VISIT OF AF PDAS MARK BELLAMY.   THE RECENT </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN BULAWAYO (REFTELS), IN PARTICULAR, HAD </p><p>CAUSED US SERIOUS CONCERN.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT HE HAD SEEN </p><p>MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS THAT WAR VETERANS BURNED DOWN THE MDC OFFICE </p><p>WHILE POLICE STOOD BY AND DID NOTHING.  THAT IS THE SORT OF </p><p>ACTION, HE SAID, WHICH GARNERS INTERNATIONAL HEADLINES AND MAKES </p><p>IT MORE LIKELY THAT ZDERA WILL PASS.  IF THAT REPORT IS TRUE AND </p><p>POLICE DID NOT TAKE ANY ACTION, SHAMUYARIRA REPLIED, THEY SHOULD </p><p>BE REPRIMANDED.  POLICE, HE ASSERTED, SHOULD BE NEUTRAL AND DO </p><p>EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO MAINTAIN LAW AND ORDER, REGARDLESS OF </p><p>WHO VIOLATES IT. </p><p> </p><p>LAND, VIOLENCE, ELECTIONS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7306 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03527  02 OF 03  231104Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  EPAE-00  DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------4231AD  231105Z /38 </p><p>P 231017Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0355 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 003527 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 11/23/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03527  02 OF 03  231104Z </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR, ZANU-PF SECRETARY OF INFORMATION NATHAN </p><p>SHAMUYARIRA DISCUSS ZDERA, POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ON LAND, THE AMBASSADOR CONTINUED, THE ABUJA AGREEMENT </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN PREEMPTED BY EXECUTIVE ACTIONS INTENDED TO </p><p>PROHIBIT THE ABILITY OF COMMERCIAL FARMERS AFFECTED BY FAST TRACK </p><p>TO PURSUE LEGAL REMEDIES.  REGARDING PREPARATIONS FOR THE </p><p>ELECTION, WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE REPORTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS.  IN ADDITION, THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS </p><p>TO THE ELECTORAL ACT CAUSE US SERIOUS CONCERN, INCLUDING THE </p><p>APPARENT INTENTION TO PREVENT CIVIL SOCIETY FROM SERVING AS </p><p>DOMESTIC ELECTION MONITORS, A ROLE THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE.  THE AMBASSADOR REMINDED SHAMUYARIRA THAT WE ARE </p><p>STILL AWAITING WORD FROM THE GOZ ON WHETHER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS WILL BE PERMITTED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SHAMUYARIRA REPLIED THAT HE WAS NOT FULLY BRIEFED ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RECENT MOVES ON LAND.  HE WAS CONCERNED BY THE </p><p>ANNOUNCED INTENTION TO LIMIT THE SIZES OF FARMS TO AS LITTLE AS </p><p>250 HECTARES, WHICH WAS "TOO SMALL FOR VIABLE FARMING."  REGARDING </p><p>THE ELECTION, THE ZANU-PF OFFICIAL SAID INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS </p><p>WOULD BE PERMITTED AFTER THE ELECTION DATES ARE ANNOUNCED.  HE </p><p>MADE IT CLEAR THAT INVITATIONS WOULD NOT BE ISSUED TO SCANDINAVIAN </p><p>COUNTRIES, WHICH HE CLAIMED STRONGLY SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION MDC </p><p>AND WOULD CAMPAIGN HEAVILY FOR THE OPPOSITION PARTY UNDER THE </p><p>GUISE OF ELECTION OBSERVATION.  "WE DO NOT WANT LONG-HAIRED </p><p>SCANDINAVIANS TEACHING US ABOUT DEMOCRACY," HE SAID.  HE ASSERTED </p><p>THAT THE RULING PARTY IS URGING ITS SUPPORTERS TO CONDUCT A </p><p>PEACEFUL CAMPAIGN, BUT HE WARNED THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>CONTROL THEM IN THE FACE OF CONTINUED PROVOCATIONS FROM THE MDC. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03527  02 OF 03  231104Z </p><p>IF THE MDC COULD KEEP ITS FOLLOWERS QUIET, HE SURMISED, ZANU-PF </p><p>COULD "LIKELY KEEP OURS QUIET AS WELL." </p><p> </p><p>OF COURSE OUR ELECTION WILL BE FREE AND FAIR </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) SHAMUYARIRA DECLARED THAT ZIMBABWE HAD HELD FREE AND FAIR </p><p>ELECTIONS SINCE INDEPENDENCE, AND HE INSISTED THAT THERE WOULD BE </p><p>NO RIGGING OR TAMPERING IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  HE </p><p>DISMISSED CONCERNS THAT REGISTRAR-GENERAL TOBAIWA MUDEDE IS TOO </p><p>CLOSELY TIED TO THE RULING PARTY.  MUDEDE, HE POINTED OUT, HAD </p><p>ORGANIZED THE FEBRUARY 2000 CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM IN WHICH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN DEFEATED, SUPERVISED THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS IN JUNE 2000 IN WHICH THE MDC WON A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER </p><p>OF SEATS, AND OVERSAW THE 2001 MAYORAL ELECTIONS IN MASVINGO AND </p><p>BULAWAYO, BOTH OF WHICH THE MDC WON.  SINCE ANY SYSTEM CAN BE </p><p>MANIPULATED, SHAMUYARIRA SAID, THE STRENGTH OF ANY ELECTORAL </p><p>PROCESS DEPENDS ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO OVERSEE </p><p>IT, AND ZIMBABWE\'S ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN NON- </p><p>PARTISAN AND OF THE HIGHEST INTEGRITY.  SHAMUYARIRA SAID HE DID </p><p>NOT THINK ANY ZIMBABWEAN BELIEVES PRESIDENT MUGABE OR ZANU-PF RIGS </p><p>ELECTIONS, ALTHOUGH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS HAMMERED THEM </p><p>FOR DOING SO.  WHEN THE OPPOSITION PARTY CALLS FOR MUDEDE TO GO, </p><p>THEY ARE REALLY PUSHING FOR AN MDC SUPPORTER TO REPLACE HIM. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ENCOURAGED THE GOZ TO ESTABLISH MECHANISMS </p><p>TO REASSURE POLITICAL PARTIES AND ZIMBABWEANS IN GENERAL OF THE </p><p>INTEGRITY AND FAIRNESS OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  ESTABLISHMENT OF </p><p>AN INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION, AS RECOMMENDED BY THE SADC </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY FORUM\'S ELECTORAL NORMS AND STANDARDS, IS ONE </p><p>IMPORTANT STEP.  ANOTHER IS TO PERMIT INTERNATIONAL OBSERVATION OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03527  02 OF 03  231104Z </p><p>THE ELECTORAL PROCESS BY CREDIBLE, NON-PARTISAN ORGANIZATIONS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, VOTER EDUCATION CAN BE AN AREA FOR COOPERATION RATHER </p><p>THAN CONFRONTATION.  TO THE EXTENT THAT ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES CAN </p><p>FIND WAYS TO MAXIMIZE THE INFORMATION GETTING TO ELIGIBLE VOTERS, </p><p>THAT HELPS BUTTRESS CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS.  SHAMUYARIRA </p><p>RESPONDED THAT THEY WOULD ALLOW POLITICAL PARTIES TO CONDUCT VOTER </p><p>EDUCATION BUT WOULD HENCEFORTH PROHIBIT NGO\'S FROM DOING SO. </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY IN ZIMBABWE IS NOT NEUTRAL, HE INSISTED BUT, RATHER, </p><p>IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE MDC.  IF THE PLEA THE AMBASSADOR WAS </p><p>MAKING WAS TO ALLOW CIVIC BODIES TO CARRY OUT VOTER EDUCATION, HE </p><p>WOULD MAKE A COUNTER-DEMAND THAT THEY BE GENUINELY NEUTRAL.  THAT </p><p>IS A FAIR POINT THAT SHOULD BE EXAMINED BY THE ELECTORAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES, THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED, BUT THE BEST PRINCIPLE, IN </p><p>GENERAL, IS THE MORE EDUCATION OF VOTERS, THE BETTER. </p><p> </p><p>RACIAL TENSIONS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) SHAMUYARIRA SAID THEY HAVE BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THE </p><p>BEHAVIOR OF "EUROPEANS" (WHITE ZIMBABWEANS), WHO DECLINED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS HERE AFTER INDEPENDENCE.

(C) WE HAD BARELY SAT DOWN WHEN SHAMUYARIRA LAUNCHED INTO </p><p>ZDERA, AND THE IMPORTANCE TO THE GOZ OF BLOCKING CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>PASSAGE.  ALTHOUGH ZDERA WOULD HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE GROUND </p><p>HERE IN TERMS OF DECREASED ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE OR IMF/IBRD RE- </p><p>ENGAGEMENT, THE GOZ AND ZANU-PF REALIZE ITS PASSAGE WOULD BE A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT GESTURE OF U.S. DISAPPROVAL OF GOZ ACTIONS, AND </p><p>THEREFORE HOPES VERY MUCH THAT IT CAN BE TURNED OFF.  THAT SAID, </p><p>ZDERA\'S APPROVAL WOULD CERTAINLY PROMPT THE GOZ TO ADD US TO THE </p><p>BURGEONING LIST OF FOREIGN ENEMIES WHICH ALREADY INCLUDES THE </p><p>UNITED KINGDOM, THE SCANDINAVIANS, AND THE EU (AT LEAST WE WOULD </p><p>BE IN GOOD COMPANY).  WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN INCREASE IN </p><p>OFFICIAL ANTI-USG RHETORIC AND REDUCED ACCESS TO GOZ OFFICIALS. </p><p>IN A WORST-CASE SCENARIO, THE GOZ WOULD USE ZDERA AS A PRETEXT TO </p><p>INVOKE SOVEREIGNTY CONCERNS AND LAUNCH A NO-HOLDS BARRED CRACKDOWN </p><p>ON THE MDC, THE INDEPENDENT PRESS, AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY SUPPORTED BY ITS NEW ENEMY.  WE RECALL THAT FM MUDENGE </p><p>SAID IN PARLIAMENT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THAT PASSAGE OF ZDERA COULD </p><p>PROMPT THE GOZ TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY, A BLUFF THAT WE </p><p>ARE WILLING TO CALL. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03527  03 OF 03  231105Z </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
