<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000916 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT RECEIVES LIMITED PRESS COVERAGE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 705 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 683 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Upon public release of the 2002 Human Rights </p><p>Report (HRR) on March 31, Embassy issued a press statement </p><p>from the Ambassador highlighting the USG human rights </p><p>concerns in Guatemala and areas where we believe improvements </p><p>can made.  However, neither the report nor the Ambassador\'s </p><p>statement received much public attention, as the recurring </p><p>theme of the human rights situation was overshadowed by the </p><p>war in Iraq and breaking political scandals.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Ambassador\'s statement reiterated USG concern over </p><p>the human rights situation and expressed hope for improvement </p><p>with the creation of CICIACS (Ref A).  Only one daily </p><p>newspaper, Prensa Libre, reported the release of the HRR and </p><p>the Ambassador\'s statement.  No radio programs covered the </p><p>report\'s release.  All press attention focused on the war in </p><p>Iraq and the latest Guatemalan scandal, that of the duel </p><p>between Attorney General Carlos de Leon and former </p><p>Anti-Corruption Prosecutor, Karen Fischer. (Ref B) </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Immediately after the public release in Washington, </p><p>HROff and PolOff delivered a copy of the report to Sara </p><p>Solis, Director of Bilateral Affairs, and Mario Cifuentes, </p><p>Senior Assistant to the Minister, at the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs.  HROff also circulated the report amongst human </p><p>rights contacts.  All recipients thanked HROff for the </p><p>detailed report and said they anxiously await translation, </p><p>which post expects to have completed with the next two weeks. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Comment: Domestic scandals in an election year and a </p><p>controversial foreign war crowded out news of the HRR\'s </p><p>release this year.  In addition, USG concern over the human </p><p>rights situation here in Guatemala is common knowledge, and </p><p>thus not particularly newsworthy.  Once we have a Spanish </p><p>translation, we will consider new PD opportunities to advance </p><p>our human rights agenda.  At a meeting April 3, however, </p><p>Foreign Minister Gutierrez said he had read the report in its </p><p>entirety.  He appeared to find it balanced and objective. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
