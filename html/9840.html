<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: RESIGNATIONS THROW OPPOSITION CHP FOR A </p><p>LOOP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4787 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass. Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Two M.P.s from the main opposition, Establishment </p><p>standard-bearer CHP resigned over the party\'s negative stance </p><p>on the "re-integration" law -- designed to coax PKK/KADEK </p><p>militants down from the mountains of n. Iraq -- which </p><p>Parliament passed July 29 (reftel).  Cemal Kaya and Nezir </p><p>Nasiroglu -- from Southeastern provinces Agri and Batman, </p><p>respectively -- explained publicly that they were "uneasy" </p><p>with CHP\'s policies on Kurdish issues.  Nasiroglu added that </p><p>the party\'s stance "is not in line with the principles of </p><p>democracy or with the promises I made to my people."  Kaya, </p><p>meanwhile, has already suggested that he is considering </p><p>joining the ruling AK Party. (Note: AK recently acquired </p><p>former independent deputy Sabahattin Ceveri from Sanliurfa, </p><p>bringing the AK total number of seats in Parliament to 366 -- </p><p>one shy of the two-thirds necessary to change the </p><p>constitution.  End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Views From Both Sides of the Tracks... </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a private conversation Aug. 1, CHP Hakkari M.P. </p><p>Esat Canan told poloff that more resignations from his party </p><p>could follow.  He railed against CHP for failing to support </p><p>the "re-integration" law, adding that he and some of his </p><p>Southeastern colleagues are considering leading an internal </p><p>opposition when Parliament reconvenes in October.  But, he </p><p>said, "if CHP cannot support democracy and social peace, then </p><p>there may not be a reason for me to stay."  He acknowledged </p><p>that, as it stood, the law may not bring large numbers of </p><p>PKK/KADEK militants down from the mountains, but that it </p><p>represented an important step.  He allowed that AK may not </p><p>have been "strong enough" to overcome Establishment </p><p>resistance to the more comprehensive law he would have </p><p>preferred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CHP deputy and Foreign Affairs Committee member Hasim </p><p>Oral offered Aug. 1 a strikingly different opinion of the </p><p>resignations and "re-integration law."  (Note: Oral hails </p><p>from Denizli in the Aegean region -- long a bastion of the </p><p>political Establishment/center-left. End note)  Oral claimed </p><p>that the resignations "will not weaken the party; they will </p><p>strengthen it" by culling disgruntled deputies.  He further </p><p>argued that "none of his constituents wants an amnesty (sic) </p><p>for the terrorists." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>...And From the Bench </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Constitutional Court Justice Hasim Kilic, a leading </p><p>advocate of comprehensive reform, explained to us privately </p><p>Aug. 1 that CHP has only itself to blame for its present </p><p>problems.  CHP is creating an image as an unprincipled and </p><p>out-of-touch party by appearing to oppose, or only </p><p>begrudgingly to accept after much hand-wringing, "everything" </p><p>-- every pro-democracy reform that comes down the pike.  He </p><p>said CHP is behaving as if its sole job is simply to gainsay </p><p>everything the AK Government does even when the Government is </p><p>doing the right thing.  This turns off the voters, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Party of Ataturk, "Freak of Nature" -- or Both? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The resignations have sparked a round of negative </p><p>press coverage against the "Party of Ataturk" by </p><p>Establishment journalists frustrated with CHP leader Deniz </p><p>Baykal\'s perceived tactical fecklessness, lack of vision, and </p><p>flaccid poll numbers.  Columnist Erdal Safak, writing in the </p><p>lead editorial in the August 1 edition of the mass daily </p><p>"Sabah,"  described CHP as a "freak of nature" with "tragic" </p><p>policies and prospects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Recently, Kemal Dervis, in whom so many CHP voters had </p><p>invested their hopes, has been making noises about internal </p><p>reform and hinting at eventually challenging Baykal for </p><p>leadership of the party.  To do so, however, would require </p><p>Dervis to energize the party by reconsidering his often </p><p>uncritical public support for Kemalist equities -- something </p><p>he has so far been loath to do (septel).  It is clear that </p><p>until CHP can make major changes, its prospects making a run </p><p>for it against the ruling AK in future elections will remain </p><p>dim. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
