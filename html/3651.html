<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001633 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO USTR FOR FHUEGEL </p><p>TREASURY FOR DO/GCHRISTOPOLUS AND AKIFAYAT, GRAO </p><p>MANILA FOR USADB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KTDB, BEXP, ECON, EINV, ETRD, EFIN, CE, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT FINANCE-DOLLAR DEBT AND </p><p>REFORM EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  (a) Colombo 001400 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) has </p><p>requested proposals for a financial facility of up to $350 </p><p>million to finance the budget deficit.  The funds raised in </p><p>this issue will ease pressure from the local money market </p><p>and interest rates.  The proceeds will be part of a Rs 329 </p><p>billion (approximately $3.4 billion) gross borrowing program </p><p>of the GSL for 2002.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GSL to borrow $350 million </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>2.  The Central Bank has requested proposals from </p><p>international investment banks and local banks to raise $350 </p><p>million in long-term debt.  The minimum tenor of the loan is </p><p>5 years and proposals are invited in the form of either a </p><p>syndicated loan, fixed rate bond or a floating rate note. </p><p>The closing date for proposals is September 6.  The Central </p><p>Bank expects to borrow the funds during the last quarter of </p><p>2002.  The funds will go to finance the GSL capital </p><p>expenditure and to retire existing short-term government </p><p>debt. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Sri Lanka will go for the debt issue, its largest ever </p><p>in international markets, minus a sovereign debt rating. </p><p>Although Sri Lankan officials have talked about seeking a </p><p>debt rating, Treasury Secretary Charitha Ratwatte told the </p><p>media a few weeks ago that the GSL would wait for the peace </p><p>process to take root, then will seek a rating.  Investment </p><p>analysts in Colombo feel that Sri Lanka would likely get a </p><p>below investment grade of B+ or BB+, close to India\'s BB </p><p>rating, if it applies for a rating for long-term foreign </p><p>currency debt. </p><p> </p><p>4. The last time the GSL raised a loan from the </p><p>international market was in 1997 when it raised $50 million </p><p>through a two year floating rate note.  In addition, in late </p><p>2001 and June 2002, GSL raised a total of $250 million </p><p>through dollar denominated bonds sold in Sri Lanka.  The </p><p>last tranche of this issue in June 2002 was priced at six </p><p>months LIBOR plus 193 basis points.  The Central Bank is </p><p>confident of receiving favorable bids for the current debt </p><p>call.  Citibank/Solomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, HSBC and </p><p>Standard Chartered Bank are among those expected to submit </p><p>bids. </p><p> </p><p>5.  According to the Central Bank, the total gross borrowing </p><p>program of the GSL for 2002 is Rs 329 billion (or about $3.4 </p><p>billion).  The proceeds from the $350 million (Rs 33.3 </p><p>billion) international debt issue will form part of the </p><p>borrowing plan, along with a $90 million dollar denominated </p><p>Development Bond issued in the local market in June.  In </p><p>addition, the Government expects about $70 million (Rs 736 </p><p>million) from concessionary foreign financing.  The balance </p><p>will be raised mostly in the local rupee market. </p><p> </p><p>Development of a long-term yield curve </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  The retirement of some rupee debt with dollar proceeds </p><p>is expected to improve market liquidity and further ease </p><p>pressure on the interest rates, which have fallen </p><p>considerably during 2002.  In response to a reduction of key </p><p>Central Bank short-term discount rates and improved </p><p>liquidity, the entire Central Bank yield curve has shifted </p><p>downwards by about 300 basis points between January and </p><p>August 2002.  Currently, short-term (3 month and 12 month) T- </p><p>bill rates are at 11-11.5% while long-term rates vary </p><p>between 13.3 percent for 4 year bonds and 14.4 percent for 6 </p><p>year bonds. </p><p> </p><p>7. In addition, the Central Bank has issued more long-term </p><p>rupee bonds and the yield curve has been extended up to 6 </p><p>years.  In a bid to develop further the long-term yield </p><p>curve, Central Bank is also expected to issue 12-year bonds </p><p>this year.  The Central Bank is said to be keen on issuing </p><p>long-term debt in view of current low interest rate climate, </p><p>but the timing and the features of the issue have not been </p><p>decided yet. </p><p> </p><p>Other financial sector developments </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>8.  Meanwhile, the Prime Minster has appointed a Financial </p><p>Sector Reforms Committee (FSRC) to fast track financial </p><p>sector reforms.  The Committee is reviewing key reforms </p><p>identified at a recent conference hosted with the assistance </p><p>of the IMF resident representative office in Colombo.  The </p><p>conference results included a series of recommendations. </p><p>Some of the reforms considered by the FSRC are relaxation of </p><p>controls on foreign exchange and the capital account, </p><p>amendments to the banking act and monetary law act, </p><p>strengthening bank supervision, relaxation of the statutory </p><p>reserve ratio, development of debt instruments and the </p><p>creation of a long term yield curve. </p><p> </p><p>New legislation </p><p>--------------- </p><p>9.  In a separate move to control public finances, the GSL </p><p>will introduce a wide-ranging Fiscal Management </p><p>(Responsibility) Act.  The purpose is to promote greater </p><p>accountability and responsibility in all public offices.  It </p><p>will place government spending under strict scrutiny and </p><p>will prevent finance ministers from giving out pre-election </p><p>subsidies and inducements to voters.  If extreme </p><p>circumstances necessitate spending over-budget, the Finance </p><p>Minster has to table a statement in Parliament justifying </p><p>the action.  Under the act, election manifestos of major </p><p>parties are to be referred to the Central Bank to assess the </p><p>long-term impact on government finances.  The Central Bank </p><p>should also investigate and comment on all government </p><p>spending plans. </p><p> </p><p>10. The law also would require the Finance Minister to </p><p>present to Parliament a financial position report annually </p><p>which will state GDP estimates and forecasts of other key </p><p>economic variables.  The Finance Minister is also expected </p><p>to present to parliament a mid year GSL fiscal position </p><p>report as well as the annual budget statement.  The GSL soon </p><p>plans to introduce several other laws or amendments to </p><p>current legislation concerning the financial sector </p><p>including regulations on monetary policy and banking, </p><p>finance companies, stocks and securities, mortgage, and debt </p><p>and loan recovery. </p><p>Amselem </p><p></p></div>
