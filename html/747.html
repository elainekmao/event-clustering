<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 010344 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, KWBG, KPAL, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  HAMAS ARRESTS:  THE POLITICS OF PRESSURE </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  PALESTINIAN MILITARY LEADERS DESCRIBED </p><p>THE JUNE 26 ARREST OF 40 HAMAS ACTIVISTS AS A </p><p>NECESSARY STEP TO FORCE HAMAS TO CEASE VIOLENT </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN GAZA AND ENTER THE POLITICAL PROCESS. </p><p>THE ARRESTS, AUTHORIZED BY PLO CHAIRMAN ARAFAT AT A </p><p>LATE NIGHT JUNE 25 "SECURITY COUNCIL" MEETING, WERE </p><p>IN REACTION TO HAMAS LEAFLETS CLAIMING </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JUNE 25 DONKEY CART SUICIDE </p><p>BOMBING (WHICH SLIGHTLY GRAZED THREE ISRAELI </p><p>SOLDIERS).  CHARGES WILL NOT BE BROUGHT AGAINST MOST </p><p>OF THOSE DETAINED, ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, AND </p><p>MOST WILL BE RELEASED "WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS." </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON JUNE 27, EMBOFF MET SEPARATELY WITH CHIEF OF </p><p>PALESTINIAN SECURITY FORCES NASSER YUSIF AND </p><p>CIVILIAN POLICE CHIEF GHAZI JABALI TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>ARRESTS OF HAMAS ACTIVITIES EARLY ON JUNE 26.  WHILE </p><p>THEIR VIEWS SOMETIMES DIVERGE WIDELY, IN THIS </p><p>INSTANCE THEIR COMMENTS WERE SIMILAR:  IN PLO </p><p>CHAIRMAN ARAFAT\'S EYES,  HAMAS\' CLAIM OF </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY (DISAVOWED LATER IN A SECOND LEAFLET) </p><p>FOR THE JUNE 26 DONKEY CART SUICIDE BOMBER NEAR KHAN </p><p>YUNIS WAS PROOF OF THE VIOLATION OF THE UNWRITTEN </p><p>UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PA AND HAMAS TO REFRAIN </p><p>FROM VIOLENT ACTS WITHIN GAZA.  ARAFAT FELT HE HAD </p><p>TO TAKE A STAND.  IN A "SECURITY COUNCIL" MEETING </p><p>LATE JUNE 25, ARAFAT ISSUED THE ORDER TO ARREST 40 </p><p>MEMBERS OF HAMAS, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT BY ALL </p><p>BRANCHES OF THE PALESTINIAN ARMED FORCES EARLY JUNE </p><p>26. </p><p> </p><p>PA SECURITY CHIEF ON HAMAS ARREST </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>3.  OF THE 40 ARRESTED, YUSIF DESCRIBED 18 OF THEM </p><p>AS THE BULK OF THE GAZA-BASED POLITICAL LEADERSHIP </p><p>OF HAMAS (INCLUDING AHMED BAHER, MAHMOUD ZAHAR, AND </p><p>MUHSEN ABU EITA);  THE REST WERE VARIOUS ACTIVISTS </p><p>ON WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A LIST OF "USUAL SUSPECTS." </p><p>BOTH SOURCES TOLD US THAT ARAFAT PERSONALLY CHOSE TO </p><p>CONCENTRATE ON THE POLITICAL RATHER THAN MILITARY </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF HAMAS, ALTHOUGH YUSIF SAID THAT HE HAD </p><p>COUNSELED ARAFAT TO ARREST THE MILITARY LEADERS </p><p>INSTEAD.  BOTH JABALI AND YUSIF BELIEVE THAT HAMAS </p><p>CARRIED OUT THE DONKEY CART INCIDENT AND THAT THE </p><p>BELATED DENIALS WERE MERELY IN REACTION TO THE </p><p>PRESSURE OF THE ARRESTS. </p><p> </p><p>POLICE CHIEF VIEWS </p><p>------------------ </p><p>4.  JABALI SAID THAT THE ARRESTS WERE A "POLITICAL" </p><p>STEP.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHER CIVILIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAD NOT BEEN INVOLVED.  NO CHARGES HAD </p><p>BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE DETAINEES.  HE PREDICTED </p><p>THAT MOST -- BUT NOT ALL -- WOULD BE RELEASED WITHIN </p><p>48 HOURS, A VIEW SECONDED BY YUSIF.  JABALI </p><p>DISMISSED THE RUMORS OF IRREGULAR TREATMENT OF THE </p><p>HAMAS ACTIVISTS IN HIS CUSTODY, SAYING THAT HIS </p><p>POLICE HAD MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT THAN </p><p>"SHAVING THE BEARD OF SHEIKH AHMED" (BAHER).  "BUT I </p><p>CAN\'T SPEAK FOR THOSE BEING DETAINED BY THE SECRET </p><p>POLICE," HE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL IMPACT OF ARAFAT\'S STEP </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>5.  YUSIF CRITICIZED HOW THE ARRESTS WERE MADE, </p><p>SAYING THAT LEGAL WARRANTS COULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED </p><p>AND CHARGES BROUGHT, BUT HE AGREED WITH JABALI THAT </p><p>THE ARRESTS THEMSELVES WERE A NECESSARY STEP.  BOTH </p><p>PREDICTED THAT BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE HAMAS WOULD </p><p>BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE </p><p>PA.  BOTH NOTED THAT HAMAS HAD NOT CUT OFF TALKS IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE ARRESTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  RESPONDING TO EMBOFF\'S QUESTIONS, JABALI </p><p>COMMENTED THAT HE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR A POSSIBLE </p><p>BACKLASH FROM HAMAS, BUT HE EXPECTED THAT THE IMPACT </p><p>OF THE ARRESTS WOULD MOSTLY BE POSITIVE, RATHER THAN </p><p>NEGATIVE.  JABALI AND YUSIF SAID THAT THE TIMING HAD </p><p>NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JULY 1 "DEADLINE" FOR </p><p>REDEPLOYMENT NEGOTIATIONS, AND BOTH PREDICTED THAT </p><p>GAZA WOULD REMAIN CALM IF THAT "DEADLINE" WERE </p><p>MISSED, SINCE THE PA IS IN FIRM CONTROL OF THE </p><p>SECURITY SITUATION.  JABALI EXPESSED MORE CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE WEST BANK, WHERE </p><p>HAMAS ACTIVITISTS ARE UNDER LESS PA CONTROL AND </p><p>PRESSURE. </p><p> </p><p>A DISSENTING VIEW </p><p>----------------- </p><p>7.  SAMIR SIKSEK, YUSIF\'S DEPUTY, EARLIER OFFERED AN </p><p>INTERPRETATION OF THE ARRESTS WHICH DIVERGED GREATLY </p><p>FROM THAT OF HIS BOSS AND OF JABALI.  IN HIS VIEW, </p><p>ARAFAT HOPED TO GOAD HAMAS INTO A VIOLENT REACTION </p><p>TO PROVIDE AN EXCUSE FOR THE ISRAELIS TO SLOW </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  THAT WAY, ACCORDING TO SIKSEK, IF </p><p>WHAT THE PALESTINIANS CONSIDER THE "DEADLINE" OF </p><p>JULY 1 IS MISSED, ARAFAT COULD BLAME HAMAS AND </p><p>PRESERVE HIS OWN POPULARITY.  SIKSEK ARGUED THAT THE </p><p>ARRESTS WERE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ARAFAT\'S ARBITRARY </p><p>AND AUTOCRATIC RULE WHICH SHOULD CONCERN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES, IF THE USG IS STILL PROMOTING PALESTINIAN </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  (COMMENT:  IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT </p><p>SIKSEK RARELY MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRITICIZE </p><p>ARAFAT AMD THAT HE DID NOT EXPRESS THESE VIEWS IN </p><p>FRONT OF YUSIF.  END COMMENT.) </p><p></p></div>
