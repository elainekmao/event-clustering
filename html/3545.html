<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001626 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE ALSO PASS TO USAID </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI GOVERNMENT HANDS LOCAL GOVERNMENT OVER TO </p><p>BUREAUCRATS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1387 </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Having allowed the terms of all locally elected </p><p>officials to expire as of July 16 (reftel), the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) has announced plans to transfer local bodies\' </p><p>functions and authority to civil servants until elections can </p><p>be held in April and new representatives installed in July. </p><p>GON officials--reportedly including the Prime Minister </p><p>himself--have acknowledged that the decision not to extend </p><p>the local bodies\' terms was politically motivated.  The </p><p>Opposition, which controlled the majority of the local </p><p>bodies, has already signaled its displeasure with the GON </p><p>plan.  Several donors, especially those with large programs </p><p>committed to strengthening local governments, have expressed </p><p>frustration with the GON action and threatened to withhold </p><p>funding.  The re-election next year of these critical </p><p>elements of grass-roots democracy is likely to require </p><p>substantial moral and material support from the international </p><p>community.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>CIVIL SERVANTS TO TAKE OVER LOCAL BODIES </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On August 15 the Cabinet decided to appoint civil </p><p>servants to assume the responsibilities and functions of </p><p>locally elected officials, whose terms were allowed to expire </p><p>July 16 (Reftel).  The Cabinet\'s decision not to extend the </p><p>five-year terms of the local bodies for another year had left </p><p>Nepal\'s 75 District Development Committees (DDCs), 58 </p><p>municipalities, and 3,912 Village Development Committees </p><p>(VDCs) with no functioning government--and thus no ability to </p><p>recieve and disburse funds--for a month. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The August 15 announcement followed an abortive </p><p>effort by the Government of Nepal (GON) to elicit an </p><p>all-party consensus on how to administer local government in </p><p>the absence of locally elected bodies.  All Opposition </p><p>parties, with the exception of the National Democratic Party </p><p>(RPP), boycotted an August 11 all-party meeting called by the </p><p>GON on the subject. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  According to the Cabinet\'s plan, civil servants from </p><p>ministries with offices at the local level (Agriculture; </p><p>Home; Education; Health; Physical Works; Local Development; </p><p>and Women, Children, and Social Welfare) will take the place </p><p>of elected local bodies officials.  Each DDC will be replaced </p><p>by a seven-member team of civil servants, headed by the Local </p><p>Development Officer (LDO) in the role of the DDC Chairman; </p><p>each municipality by a five-member team, with the </p><p>municipality\'s Executive Officer sitting in for the mayor, </p><p>and each VDC by a three-member team, with the VDC Secretary </p><p>subbing for the VDC Chairman.  (An earlier plan to include </p><p>members of civil society organizations in these newly formed </p><p>bodies was nixed.)  Ganga Dutta Awasthi, Joint Secretary for </p><p>the Ministry of Local Development, acknowledged that the </p><p>Maoists had disrupted the operations of many rural VDCs--700 </p><p>VDC offices have been destroyed in the course of the </p><p>insurgency--but he expressed confidence in the GON\'s ability </p><p>to recruit adequate numbers of bureaucrats to serve in these </p><p>remote areas.  The Ministry already has applied to the Civil </p><p>Service Commission to fill 350 vacant VDC Secretary slots. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Awasthi emphasized the temporary nature of the new </p><p>arrangement, which will remain in place until new local </p><p>elections can be held next year. The GON has committed to </p><p>hold these elections by April, he noted.  Since local </p><p>elections are a lengthy and cumbersome process--DDCs can only </p><p>be elected after VDCs are in place--the new local bodies are </p><p>unlikely to be in place until July 2003 at the earliest, he </p><p>conceded. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>OPPOSITION, SOME DONORS UNHAPPY </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The Cabinet decision to allow the local bodies\' </p><p>terms to expire unleashed a firestorm of criticism from the </p><p>Opposition, as well as from several donors.  Jhala Nath </p><p>Khanal, a Standing Committee Member of the Communist Party of </p><p>Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML), which controlled the </p><p>majority of such bodies, denounced the move as </p><p>"anti-democratic."  Democratically elected officials at the </p><p>village level occupy the front lines against Maoist </p><p>insurgents, he argued, and are thus often targeted for </p><p>intimidation and assassination.  By letting democratically </p><p>elected local bodies expire, Khanal charged, the Nepali </p><p>Congress government has achieved by bureaucratic fiat exactly </p><p>what the Maoists have been trying to accomplish through their </p><p>campaign of terror and murder:  the abolition of local </p><p>democratic government. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Nor is the UML sounding the only note of </p><p>discontent.  Several donors with  projects aimed at </p><p>strengthening local government, including the Germans, Swiss, </p><p>Dutch, Danes, and UNDP, have all expressed dissatisfaction </p><p>with the GON decision, with some--most notably the Germans </p><p>and Swiss--threatening to freeze disbursements for some </p><p>projects.  Awasthi said those donors reacted too hastily, </p><p>noting that the GON decisions both to allow local bodies to </p><p>expire and to assume responsibility for the functions of </p><p>those bodies after their expiration were fully in accord with </p><p>the Local Self-Governance Act.  He believes the new </p><p>bureaucratic arrangement will persuade these donors to resume </p><p>disbursements.  The local head of the German aid agency, </p><p>however, told emboff his organization will likely bypass the </p><p>new official local bodies, working instead with user groups </p><p>and other community organizations.  The Swiss aid director </p><p>said his agency was still considering how to respond to the </p><p>GON plan.  A World Bank official said that his organization </p><p>was considering whether to withhold some budgetary support </p><p>from the central government as a way of expressing its </p><p>disapproval for the move. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL MOTIVATION? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  Adding to the donors\' displeasure is the GON\'s </p><p>explicit acknowledgement that party politics played a </p><p>substantial role in the decision not to extend the local </p><p>bodies for one year.  Officials at the National Planning </p><p>Commission and the Ministry of Local Development have told </p><p>emboffs that the PM and his Cabinet feared the </p><p>Opposition-dominated local bodies would divert funding to </p><p>support UML candidates in the upcoming national elections. </p><p>(The Prime Minister himself reportedly admitted these motives </p><p>to a group of donors during a recent meeting on the budget.) </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Faced with the imminent expiration of local </p><p>bodies, the PM had two choices consistent with Nepali law: </p><p>allowing them to lapse or extending their term for one year. </p><p>He chose the former, primarily for admittedly partisan </p><p>reasons.  Unfortunately, this decision follows others--the </p><p>dissolution of Parliament, the extension of a state of </p><p>emergency that suspends nearly all civil rights--that leaves </p><p>Nepal\'s young democracy in a particularly precarious </p><p>condition with no elected representatives at any level of </p><p>government.  Filling the year-long vacuum at the local level </p><p>with bureaucrats is a pale substitute, especially since civil </p><p>servants owe their allegiance to their respective line </p><p>ministries, rather than to local residents whose interests </p><p>they should be advocating.  Pressure from foreign missions, </p><p>including this one, reportedly persuaded the GON leadership </p><p>to commit to holding local bodies elections by April.  These </p><p>elections, like the parliamentary elections scheduled for </p><p>November, are likely to require substantial administrative </p><p>and financial support from the international community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
