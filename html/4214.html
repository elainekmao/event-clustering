<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003034 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  PDP SETS PRIMARY SCHEDULE; FAILS TO </p><p>RESOLVE OBASANJO/ATIKU RIFT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2975 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons:  1.5 (B & </p><p>D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  The ruling PDP\'s National Executive </p><p>Committee met October 31 in a failed effort to heal the </p><p>Obasanjo/Atiku rift, according to Deputy House Speaker </p><p>Nwuche.  The Vice President\'s faction won the three key </p><p>decisions at the four-hour meeting.  First, efforts by </p><p>Obasanjo\'s supporters to adopt the Obasanjo/Atiku ticket by </p><p>consensus were rejected.  Second, the session backed the </p><p>legislators\' proposed (and Atiku\'s preferred) primary </p><p>timetable and, third, it nullified the requirement that </p><p>candidates complete "intent to run" forms early which would </p><p>have forced Atiku to make known his intentions to challenge </p><p>Obasanjo.  Now Atiku has more flexibility and time to </p><p>decide.  The inability to resolve the rift between its two </p><p>top office-holders demonstrated again the strength of </p><p>factionalism within the PDP.  Reconciliation will prove </p><p>elusive and infighting will likely grow more intense as the </p><p>countdown to primaries and the party convention approaches. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The ruling People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) </p><p>National Executive Committee (NEC) October 31 meeting </p><p>failed to heal the political rift between President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo and Vice President Atiku Abubakar. </p><p>During a private breakfast meeting at the Ambassador\'s </p><p>Residence the following day, Deputy Speaker of the House of </p><p>Representatives Chibudom Nwuche told Ambassador Jeter that </p><p>Obasanjo and Atiku communicate only through "surrogates," </p><p>and the gap between the two appeared to be widening. </p><p>During the NEC meeting, attended by Obasanjo, Atiku, </p><p>senators, governors and party officials past and present, </p><p>the NEC rejected a proposal by Edo State Governor Igbegnion </p><p>to adopt Obasanjo and Atiku (as well as all sitting </p><p>governors and their deputies) as consensus candidates for </p><p>the anticipated 2003 elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Nwuche further said the NEC also rejected the </p><p>President\'s efforts to hold the presidential primary before </p><p>the other national and state primaries.  Obasanjo had hoped </p><p>to win his presidential spot then use this secured position </p><p>to promote his choices for legislative and gubernatorial </p><p>nominations.  Moreover, with Obasanjo securing his place </p><p>first, the contestants in the other races would need his </p><p>support and, in the process, be obliged to promise their </p><p>loyalty.  At the end of the NEC meeting, however, PDP </p><p>Chairman Audu Ogbeh announced that the party\'s primaries </p><p>would commence mid-December starting with nominations for </p><p>the State Houses of Assembly; no timetable for the </p><p>subsequent primaries was announced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  In a related development, the PDP also adopted </p><p>guidelines for nominations, setting fees for potential </p><p>candidates, starting at five million Naira (38 thousand </p><p>dollars) for President and dropping to 100,000 Naira (820 </p><p>dollars) for State Houses of Assembly.  To encourage female </p><p>candidates, PDP Chairman Ogbeh announced that the fees </p><p>would be waived for women.  Adding further to the </p><p>uncertainty surrounding the process, the NEC also </p><p>eliminated the deadline for potential candidates to declare </p><p>their intentions by nid-November - a gambit designed to </p><p>flush out Atiku.  Instead, candidates will be able to file </p><p>until the eve of the primaries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  The PDP was yet again unable to resolve </p><p>the differences between the President and his Vice.  The </p><p>Vice President\'s forces emerged from the NEC strengthened, </p><p>with Obasanjo\'s weaknesses evident.  Unable to get himself </p><p>selected as a consensus candidate, Obasanjo now must temper </p><p>himself for a tough fight for the nomination, with Atiku as </p><p>one likely, if late, challenger.  The primary timetable and </p><p>the elimination of the filing deadline serve Atiku\'s </p><p>interests, giving him the chance to assess his chances and </p><p>delay announcing his candidacy until the last minute before </p><p>directly challenging Obasanjo.  The indirect challenge will </p><p>take shape around the primary process, with each campaign </p><p>turning into a miniature test of strength between Obasanjo, </p><p>on the one hand, and Atiku and other challengers, on the </p><p>other. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
