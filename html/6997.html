<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 001378 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); OES/IHA, IO/PPC, L/UNA, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SOCI, TBIO, VT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION TO </p><p>CONTROL BIOMEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.THE VATICAN\'S PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE HAS ISSUED A </p><p>SET OF GUIDELINES FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH TO PROTECT HUMAN </p><p>DIGNITY.  MEMBERS OF THE ACADEMY RECOMMENDED ETHICALLY </p><p>BASED INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION ON BIOMEDICAL TECHNIQUES </p><p>    THAT REFLECTED THE "VALUES DESCRIBED IN THE NATURE OF THE </p><p>HUMAN PERSON."  THE ACADEMY GUIDELINES STRESSED THAT </p><p>EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIOMEDICINE MUST BE CONDUCTED </p><p>WITHIN THE AMBIT OF "DEFINITE ENDS" AND ETHICS.  WHILE IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE THERE ARE NO ETHICAL BARRIERS BEYOND WHICH THE </p><p>HUMAN PERSON IS FORBIDDEN TO APPLY HIS "COGNITIVE ENERGY," </p><p>THERE ARE PRECISE ETHICAL LIMITS FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE ACADEMY, "WHAT IS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE IS </p><p>NOT FOR THAT VERY REASON MORALLY ADMISSIBLE."  THE ULTIMATE </p><p>AIM OF EVERY RESEARCH ACTIVITY IN THE BIOMEDICAL FIELD MUST </p><p>BE THE "INTEGRAL GOOD OF MAN." </p><p> </p><p>2.KEY TO VATICAN ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IS THE AVOIDANCE </p><p>OF ANY FORM OF "INSTRUMENTALIZATION" OR DESTRUCTION OF THE </p><p>HUMAN BEING.  THE VATICAN ALSO SEEKS TO KEEP BIOMEDICAL </p><p>RESEARCH FREE FROM COMPROMISING LINKS TO POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC INTERESTS.  TO MEET THESE GUIDELINES, THE ACADEMY </p><p>HAS PUT FORWARD A THREE-STAGE METHODOLOGY FOR BIOMEDICAL </p><p>RESEARCH THAT RESPECTS THE GOOD OF THE HUMAN PERSON: 1) THE </p><p>PRESENTATION OF THE BIOMEDICAL DATA; 2) EXAMINATION OF THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HUMAN PERSON AND DISCERNMENT OF THE </p><p>VALUES THIS RAISES; AND 3) THE ELABORATION OF ETHICAL NORMS </p><p>THAT CAN GUIDE THE WORK OF THOSE INVOLVED IN A GIVEN </p><p>SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.THE ACADEMY ALSO INSISTED UPON A HIGH STANDARD OF </p><p>F </p><p>PROFESSIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND A RIGOROUS PROCEDURAL </p><p>METHODOLOGY CONCERNING THERAPEUTIC AND NON-THERAPEUTIC </p><p>EXPERIMENTATION.  EXPERIMENTATION ON ANIMALS IS ALSO </p><p>ENCOURAGED, TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF HUMAN SUBJECTS.  THE </p><p>    ACADEMY PAPER PICKS UP ON STANDARD VATICAN POLICY ON THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF HUMAN EMBRYOS, DECLARING THAT EXPERIMENTATION </p><p>ON THEM "IN THE LIGHT OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES" IS </p><p>ETHICALLY UNACCEPTABLE GIVEN THE HIGH RISK OF IRREVERSIBLE </p><p>DAMAGE OR DEATH.  DESTRUCTION OF EMBRYOS, EVEN IN ORDER TO </p><p>BENEFIT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS, IS JUDGED TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. </p><p>THE ACADEMY FOR LIFE STRESSED THAT "IT IS NEVER MORALLY </p><p>LICIT TO DO EVIL INTENTIONALLY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ENDS </p><p>THAT ARE GOOD IN THEMSELVES, AND ANY EXPERIMENTATION ON THE </p><p>HUMAN EMBRYO THAT DOES NOT PRODUCE A DIRECT BENEFIT FOR ITS </p><p>OWN HEALTH IS MORALLY ILLICIT. </p><p> </p><p>4.COMMENT: THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE IS THE BODY </p><p>IN THE ROMAN CURIA CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING CATHOLIC </p><p>TEACHING ON LIFE ISSUES.  THE ACADEMY "STATEMENT," </p><p>THEREFORE, REPRESENTS OFFICIAL HOLY SEE POLICY ON </p><p>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH.  ITS DEVELOPMENT AND RELEASE NOW </p><p>REFLECTS THE HOLY SEE\'S DESIRE TO SHAPE AND INFLUENCE </p><p>ONGOING WORK AT THE UN TO ACHIEVE AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONVENTION TO BAN HUMAN CLONING.  THE HOLY SEE OBSERVER </p><p>MISSION TO THE UN WILL CERTAINLY RELY ON AND REFER TO THIS </p><p>NEW "POSITION PAPER" AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THAT PROCESS. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA01378 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
