(U) May Day March Bigger Than Past Years </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>Between 25,000 and 35,000 workers marched in May Day parades </p><p>in the capital, a significant increase over recent years. </p><p>The marchers, ranks were swelled by teacher organizations, </p><p>who concluded a successful nationwide strike in March. </p><p>(Note: The teacher strike was ruled illegal by labor courts, </p><p>but Congress passed an amnesty for strikers on April 2. </p><p>Teachers remain in dialogue with the government on unresolved </p><p>budgetary demands and the fate of an education </p><p>decentralization teachers unions have labeled privatization. </p><p>End Note.)  The May Day march was initially divided between </p><p>two major groupings, the UASP labor federation, which </p><p>includes teachers groups, and the other major federations </p><p>(UGT, UNSITRAGUA, CSNP).  All came together in the central </p><p>square and were unified in their common demands: </p><p> </p><p>-- job creation, decent wages, reinstatement of illegally </p><p>fired workers, agrarian reform, greater freedom to organize </p><p>unions and bargain collectively, full implementation of the </p><p>Peace Accords, </p><p>-- resignation of the Labor Minister (for abuse of authority), </p><p>-- rejection of a CAFTA and FTAA, </p><p>-- rejection of payments to ex-civil defense patrollers who </p><p>committed human rights abuses, </p><p>-- rejection of increased payroll deductions for Social </p><p>Security, and demands for greater autonomy for the Social </p><p>Security Institute, </p><p>-- rejection of fuel and electricity price hikes, and </p><p>-- rejection of privatization of education, health and social </p><p>security. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) President Portillo Touts Labor Priorities and CAFTA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>The May 2 copy of the government\'s official daily, "Diario de </p><p>Centro America," includes text of President Portillo\'s May </p><p>Day speech, including the following comments on the labor </p><p>clause of a CAFTA: </p><p> </p><p>-- The labor clause must be integrated into the main text of </p><p>a CAFTA agreement, </p><p> </p><p>-- There should be a "cooperative focus" in the enforcement </p><p>mechanism, </p><p> </p><p>-- Responsibilities of governments and companies should be </p><p>clearly differentiated, </p><p> </p><p>-- Our right to require clarification and amplification of </p><p>the text must be respected, </p><p> </p><p>-- It should be understood that we cannot assume short term </p><p>solutions for structural problems that require medium and </p><p>long-term solutions, </p><p> </p><p>-- The dispute settlement mechanism for labor issues must be </p><p>separate from other disputes, due to its special nature and </p><p>the ILO and bilateral rules. </p><p> </p><p>The speech also highlights other GOG labor priorities: </p><p> </p><p>-- Ministry restructuring (new Strategic 5-year Plan) to </p><p>better meet today\'s realities (70% of workers in informal </p><p>sector, 50% of workers located in rural areas, coffee crisis, </p><p>a weak Labor Ministry). </p><p> </p><p>-- A Labor Ministry budget boost of 30% for 2004. </p><p> </p><p>-- A collective bargaining agreement for the ministry\'s </p><p>workers. </p><p> </p><p>-- Labor Code reforms to be sent to Congress shortly: on </p><p>child labor, domestic workers, sexual harassment, universal </p><p>(no-fault) severance pay, and procedural and administrative </p><p>process changes. </p><p> </p><p>-- Tripartite dialogue, formation of a national recreation </p><p>institute for recreation for public sector employees, a new </p><p>national core labor rights course. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) HRR and UNICEF Child Labor Report Get Headlines </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>Major daily Prensa Libre printed an opinion piece on May 2 </p><p>headlined "Labor Criticisms from the U.S. Against Guatemala" </p><p>noting criticisms of labor rights violations in the context </p><p>of CAFTA negotiations.  The article quoted extensively from </p><p>the Department\'s Human Rights Report for 2002 (newly </p><p>translated and on the Embassy\'s website).  Press also gave </p><p>extensive coverage to a recent report from the National </p><p>Statistical Institute, funded by UNICEF and the World Bank, </p><p>which reported the following statistics for child labor in </p><p>Guatemala: </p><p> </p><p>-- highest incidence of child labor in Central America </p><p>(507,000 children working between ages 7 and 14 (66% male, </p><p>56% indigenous, 77% rural); 418,000 between ages 15 and 17 </p><p>(66% male, 47% indigenous, 69% rural); a total of 925,000 </p><p>child workers). </p><p> </p><p>-- The rate of child workers has risen from 7.9% in 1994 to </p><p>23.5% today. </p><p> </p><p>-- 68% of child workers work in the agriculture sector. </p><p> </p><p>-- 76% of child workers work for their families and are not </p><p>paid for their labor. </p><p> </p><p>-- Child workers work an average of 47 hours per week. </p><p> </p><p>-- 8,000 child workers work in dangerous professions such as </p><p>fireworks production and in mines. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Banana Conflict Escalating </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>In early March, 38 workers at the Lourdes and Fatimah </p><p>plantations owned by BANDEGUA and leased to independent </p><p>producers were fired in retaliation for a two week work </p><p>stoppage during which workers also blockaded an access road </p><p>that serves a number of plantations, including some not </p><p>involved in the work stoppages.  BANDEGUA is the Guatemalan </p><p>subsidiary of Del Monte Fresh Produce of Coral Gables, </p><p>Florida.  On April 24 the SITRABI banana workers union told </p><p>U.S. Representative Levin that another 60 workers have since </p><p>been fired, and all 98 workers and the SITRABI union </p><p>leadership have been charged in criminal court for violations </p><p>related to the loss of fruit and blockage of transit.  The </p><p>Solidarity Center is considering including the conflict in </p><p>its submission for CAFTA labor comments.  LabAtt inquired </p><p>about this case on April 30 to Vice Labor Minister Monzon, </p><p>and expressed concern that the ministry mediate labor </p><p>conflicts before they escalate into criminal actions. </p><p>Monzon\'s son, Sergio Monzon Ordonez, is reportedly the new </p><p>operator of the plantations.  Monzon Sr. said a high level </p><p>GOG group is being formed to seek resolution of the conflict </p><p>and will provide additional information on May 7. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Social Security Institute (IGSS) Raises Rates </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>The IGSS has invested funds in a controversial new housing </p><p>project, and been the subject of union and employer calls for </p><p>greater political autonomy, and the subject of never-ending </p><p>corruption scandals that leave hospitals without medicine. </p><p>Even more controversial, however, was the decision by the </p><p>IGSS board to increase employer and worker payroll deductions </p><p>beginning in April.   By changing the calculation of base pay </p><p>to include mandatory bonuses, the IGSS decision nearly </p><p>tripled the average contribution by workers and employers. </p><p>The board also decided to delay IGSS coverage for new </p><p>registrants for four months after inscription.  The payroll </p><p>tax increase sparked a constitutional challenge from </p><p>employers (CACIF), a non-binding resolution in Congress </p><p>asking the board to reconsider the increase, and protests </p><p>from labor groups. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Unemployment Rising </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>Press reported that unemployment (including underemployment </p><p>) jobs that once finished, lead to unemployment) jumped from </p><p>10.8% in 2000 to 18.3% in 2002, according to the National </p><p>Statistical Institute\'s August-September 2002 Survey of </p><p>Employment and Income.  During the same period, however, </p><p>employment (especially in the informal sector) has increased, </p><p>as more women have entered the workforce (increasing from </p><p>700,000 in 1989 to 1.8 million (of a total of 4.9 million) in </p><p>2002).  In Guatemala City, 43% of women workers are </p><p>unemployed or under-employed.  The agriculture sector, which </p><p>includes 50% of all male workers nationwide and 18% of women </p><p>workers, has the highest rate of informal employment (80%), </p><p>where workers are not covered by social security or other </p><p>legal protections. </p><p> </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
