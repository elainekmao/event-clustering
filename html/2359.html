<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000032 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MURDER CONVICT HANGED IN KADUNA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  On January 3, a man recently convicted of the July </p><p>2000 murder of a woman and her two children by a Shari\'a </p><p>court in Katsina was hanged in Kaduna.  The man, Sani Yakubu </p><p>Rodi, became the first person to be executed under the </p><p>criminal Shari\'a system.  Although the Shari\'a Court had </p><p>determined that Rodi should be executed by stabbing, the mode </p><p>of execution was changed to hanging.  Apparently, the trial </p><p>court choose stabbing because Rodi killed his victims with a </p><p>knife. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Comment:  In that Rodi was a confessed triple </p><p>murderer, his case had none of the human rights implications </p><p>of the Safiya Husseini stoning sentence for  adultery (see </p><p>septel.)  However in that the first capital punishment under </p><p>Shari\'a now has been carried out, proponents of criminal </p><p>Shari\'a and its traditional penalties may begin to agitate </p><p>more actively for the implementation of the controversial </p><p>stoning sentence in Husseini\'s case. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
