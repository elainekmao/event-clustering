<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008621 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/04/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: DRC FOREIGN MINISTER PRAISES UN RESOLUTION 1332, </p><p>SAYS PRESIDENT BONGO WILL PLAY LEAD ROLE AT LIBREVILLE II </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF KENT C. BROKENSHIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY: FOREIGN MINISTER OKITUNDU TOLD AMBASSADOR </p><p>SWING HE WAS PLEASED WITH UN RESOLUTION 1332, PARTICULARLY </p><p>THE SPECIFIC MENTION OF CITIES WHERE MONUC WOULD DEPLOY. HE </p><p>CLAIMED THIS WOULD DISCOURAGE PARTITION OF THE CONGO. HE </p><p>PREFERRED THE CONGO CONFLICT\'S FOLLOW-UP MEETING TO TAKE </p><p>PLACE IN NEW YORK, NOT ADDIS ABABA. OKITUNDU DEFENDED THE </p><p>GDRC\'S DECEMBER 25 BOMBING RAIDS ON GBADOLITE AND GEMENA, AND </p><p>PRAISED PRESIDENT KABILA\'S WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE </p><p>DRC TO MEET WITH OPPOSITION GROUPS. HE CLAIMED THE OPPOSITION </p><p>SHUNNED PRESIDENT KABILA IN LIBREVILLE OUT OF FEAR THEY WOULD </p><p>BE ARRESTED IF THEY BOARDED A KABILA-CHARTERED AIRCRAFT. TO </p><p>ASSUAGE THE OPPOSITION, OKITUNDU SAID PRESIDENT BONGO WOULD </p><p>"TAKE CHARGE" OF ORGANIZING A SECOND MEETING BETWEEN THE GDRC </p><p>AND THE OPPOSITION IN LIBREVILLE AT THE END OF JANUARY. OTHER </p><p>SUBJECTS SEPTELS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>TALK OF PEACE </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AMBASSADOR SWING MET WITH FOREIGN MINISTER LEONARD SHE </p><p>OKITUNDU DECEMBER 27 TO  DISCUSS THE LATTER\'S RECENT VISIT TO </p><p>NEW YORK IN SUPPORT OF UN RESOLUTION 1332. OKITUNDU SAID HE </p><p>WAS PLEASED WITH THE DOCUMENT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SPECIFIC </p><p>MENTION OF TOWNS WHERE MONUC FORCES SHOULD DEPLOY, I.E. </p><p>KISANGANI AND MBANDAKA, AND POSSIBLY GOMA AND BUKAVU. AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THIS, HE SAID RESOLUTION 1332 REINFORCES THE </p><p>CONCEPT OF AN INDIVISIBLE CONGO SINCE IT SPREADS MONUC FORCES </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY (AS OPPOSED TO STATIONING UN TROOPS </p><p>ALONG THE FRONT SEPARATING THE WARRING FACTIONS). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE FOREIGN MINISTER WAS PLEASED AT THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL\'S INVITATION IN UNSCR 1332 FOR THE SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVENING A MEETING IN FEBRUARY </p><p>BETWEEN THE LUSAKA SIGNATORIES AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL. AS A </p><p>VENUE HE PREFERRED NEW YORK RATHER THAN ADDIS ABABA, AS NEW </p><p>YORK REPRESENTED A MORE NEUTRAL SETTING. IN THE MEANTIME, HE </p><p>SAID ALL SIDES SHOULD RESPECT THE DISENGAGEMENT PLAN AND </p><p>HONOR THE LATEST CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>TALK OF WAR </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AMBASSADOR SWING ASKED HOW OKITUNDU RECONCILED HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RECENT SIGNATURE OF DISENGAGEMENT SUB-PLANS WITH </p><p>REPORTS THAT KABILA AND HIS ALLIES HAD BOMBARDED GBADOLITE </p><p>AND GEMENA ON DECEMBER 25. OKITUNDU REPLIED THAT GDRC WAS </p><p>UNDER ATTACK ON TWO FRONTS, WITH ONE ASSAULT APPARENTLY </p><p>TARGETING LUBUMBASHI. THESE ATTACKS ARE IN THEMSELVES </p><p>VIOLATIONS AND MUST BE MET BY FORCE. "IF WE DO NOT FIGHT </p><p>BACK, LUBUMBASHI WILL FALL." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) PROMPTED BY AMBASSADOR SWING, OKITUNDU SAID PRESIDENT </p><p>KABILA\'S DECEMBER 22 MEETING WITH ZIMBABWE\'S ROBERT MUGABE </p><p>AND NAMIBIA\'S SAM NUJOMA IN KINSHASA, AND HIS SUBSEQUENT </p><p>BRIEFING OF DOS SANTOS IN LUANDA ON THE KINSHASA MEETING, </p><p>WERE IN FACT COUNSELS OF WAR IN RESPONSE TO RWANDAN AND </p><p>UGANDAN ATTACKS IN THE CONGO. WHILE HE DID NOT DIVULGE THE </p><p>DETAILS OF THE MEETINGS, THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT IF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FAILED TO STOP THE CURRENT </p><p>OFFENSIVES "THEN WE MUST BE PREPARED TO USE OTHER MEANS." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>BONGO TO TAKE CHARGE OF LIBREVILLE II </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) PRESIDENT KABILA\'S ATTEMPT TO MEET WITH OPPOSITION </p><p>GROUPS IN LIBREVILLE DECEMBER 21 FAILED IN PART BECAUSE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION FEARED FOR THEIR SAFETY. ACCORDING </p><p>TO OKITUNDU, MAJOR OPPOSITION FIGURES REFUSED TO BOARD AN </p><p>AIRCRAFT CHARTERED BY PRESIDENT KABILA OUT OF FEAR THE PLANE </p><p>WAS IN FACT A TRAP SET TO BAG THE LOT OF THEM, AND SEND THEM </p><p>TO DETENTION CENTERS IN LUBUMBASHI. MANY ALSO FEARED THAT </p><p>KABILA WOULD SO DOMINATE THE LIBREVILLE AGENDA (AS HE HAS </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO DO IN EVERY POLITICAL FORUM TO DATE) THAT IT WAS </p><p>POINTLESS TO ATTEND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) YET THE WILL TO MEET WITH KABILA IS THERE, INSISTED </p><p>OKITUNDU. HE CLAIMED THAT OPPOSITION GROUPS ROUTINELY CALL </p><p>THE PRESIDENT TO ASK FOR APPOINTMENTS, AND THAT BOTH THE </p><p>INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPPOSITION ORIGINALLY APPROVED OF THE </p><p>LIBREVILLE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IN ORDER TO DISPEL OPPOSITION FEARS, OKITUNDU SAID THE </p><p>GDRC IS ASKING PRESIDENT BONGO TO TAKE COMPLETE CHARGE OF </p><p>LIBREVILLE II, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR THE END OF JANUARY. THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER DID NOT ELABORATE ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE </p><p>GOB\'S COMING RESPONSIBILITIES. HOWEVER, THEY ARE LIKELY TO </p><p>INCLUDE THE FORUM\'S AGENDA AS WELL AS LOGISTICAL SUPPORT IN </p><p>ARRANGING FOR THE TRANSPORTATION, LODGING, AND FEEDING OF </p><p>WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE SEVERAL HUNDRED CONGOLESE PARTICIPANTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH HIS "PACKAGING" OF KABILA\'S POLICIES </p><p>IS MORE ATTRACTIVE, AND HIS PRESENTATION OF THE ISSUES FAR </p><p>LESS EMOTIONAL THAN HIS PREDECESSOR\'S, IT IS ALSO APPARENT </p><p>THAT OKITUNDU\'S MARGIN OF MANEUVER IS EXTREMELY NARROW -- IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO THAT OF HIS EARLIER HUMAN RIGHTS PORTFOLIO -- AS </p><p>THIS LATEST CONVERSATION APTLY ILLUSTRATES. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
