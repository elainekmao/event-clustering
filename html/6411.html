GOING TO WAR WITHOUT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S APPROVAL </p><p>IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE DEATH OF INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY AND </p><p>POSSIBLY THE UN.

EVERYONE IS CONVINCED, WHETHER THEY ARE ACCEPTED OR NOT </p><p>ACCEPTED, THAT THE WAR IS KNOCKING ON OUR DOORS, BUT THE IRAQI </p><p>REGIME IS STILL TRYING TO GAIN TIME, TO PLAY WITH TIME, AND IS </p><p>DEALING WITH THE CRISIS IN EASY INSTALLMENTS.  ALTHOUGH IRAQ HAS </p><p>RESPONDED TO UNSC RESOLUTION 1441, YET VERY SLOWLY, JUST LIKE ITS </p><p>HABIT OF DEALING WITH IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WOULD AVERT THE </p><p>IRAQIS MORE TRAGEDIES.  THE CRISIS OF THE FIRST GULF WAR IS STILL </p><p>IN THE AIR, AND THE CRISIS OF THE SECOND GULF WAR, RESULTING FROM </p><p>THE CRIMINAL INVASION OF KUWAIT, IS STILL GOING ON AS WELL.  IN </p><p>ORDER TO STOP THE CRISIS OF A THIRD GULF WAR, INITIATIVES AND </p><p>SINCERE ADVISE WERE GIVEN TO THE IRAQI REGIME TO CHANGE ITS </p><p>ATTITUDE AND TO HELP PAVE THE WAY FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE REGIME HAS IGNORED ALL OF THIS INSTEAD OF CLOSING </p><p>OPENINGS FOR WAR ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.

BUSH\'S STATEMENT WAS APPLAUDED BY ISRAEL, WHO KNEW WHAT HE </p><p>WOULD SAY BEFORE HE SAID IT.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>ADMINISTRATION DEALS FLEXIBLY WITH ALL PEACE INITIATIVES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY AS SEEN WITH THE NOMINATION OF MAHMOUD ABBAS, ABU </p><p>MAZEN, AS PRIME MINISTER OF PALESTINE, WHOM ISRAEL APPROVED OF </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS POSITION TOWARDS THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA!!  WHAT </p><p>IS MORE IMPORTANT IS THE PALESTINIAN MAN WHO IS THE PULSE OF THE </p><p>CURRENT INTIFADA.  THIS MAN WILL NEVER YIELD TO ANY TRIALS </p><p>TERMINATING HIS LEGITIMATE BATTLE.  THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA IS </p><p>SUPPOSED TO MOVE THE PEACE PROCESS FORWARD AND NOT BE MOVED BY </p><p>PEOPLE WHO DO NOT EVEN SYMPATHIZE WITH PALESTINIANS." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
