<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002375 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Developments in the Middle East situation continues </p><p>to dominate lead reporting over the past few days. </p><p>Over the weekend, May 10-12, front-page news reports </p><p>on the end of the Church of the Nativity crisis and on </p><p>the end of Arafat\'s siege.  Newspapers also highlight </p><p>King Abdullah\'s visit to the United States, featuring </p><p>extensive coverage of his remarks and his meetings </p><p>there.  Other stories highlight the Sharm El-Sheik </p><p>summit meeting and its final decision against "all </p><p>forms of violence".  Although the majority of </p><p>editorial commentaries view the outcome of the summit </p><p>as a "push for peace" and a show of Arab support and </p><p>willingness for peace, some argue that the main issue </p><p>is the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories </p><p>and the Palestinian right of resistance. </p><p> </p><p>                Editorial Commentaries </p><p> </p><p>-- "Rejecting all forms of violence" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Rakan Majali writes on the back page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/14):  "Evidently, American pressures are no longer </p><p>focused against the Palestinian National Authority, </p><p>but also against the moderate Arab countries, who are </p><p>expected to have a role in putting a stop to the </p><p>martyrdom operations.  According to the Sharm El-Sheik </p><p>summit\'s final statement, rejecting all forms of </p><p>violence is the only way to resume the peace process. </p><p>This is true.  However, the confrontations [between </p><p>the Palestinians and the Israelis] are not happening </p><p>because of the martyrdom operations, but as a result </p><p>of Israel\'s barbaric of extermination, and the </p><p>Palestinians have not choice but to respond.  Another </p><p>point to be taken into consideration is the fact that </p><p>the continuation of the Israeli occupation of the </p><p>Palestinian territories is the peak of aggression and </p><p>the ultimate action of terror." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Why martyrdom operations?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Yaser Za\'atreh writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al- </p><p>Dustour (05/14):  "Here goes the Arab official </p><p>statements rejecting the martyrdom operations under </p><p>American pressures.  The question is why this viscous </p><p>American attack against martyrdom operation in </p><p>particular?  It proves that these operations are the </p><p>strongest weapons in the hands of the Palestinians, </p><p>and that its acceptability among the young Palestinian </p><p>men and its development could turn into a real victory </p><p>against the Hebrew state.  Washington, concerned for </p><p>Israeli interests, wants to rob the Palestinians of </p><p>their strongest weapon, a weapon that can abolish the </p><p>occupation.  Unfortunately, in their moment of </p><p>weakness, the Arabs are going along with what </p><p>Washington wants, only to make the task of the martyrs </p><p>more difficult." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Arab movement towards peace" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/13):  "In general, the objectives of the current </p><p>Arab political movement are crystal clear.  There is </p><p>great enthusiasm among the Arab countries to play the </p><p>leadership role in times of quiet and peace.  Yet, </p><p>this enthusiasm disappears completely in times of </p><p>crises and the Arab countries become silent.  There is </p><p>an Arab move towards peace under the motto of `let </p><p>bygones be bygones\'.  There is no move to make Sharon </p><p>to pay for his crimes.  In fact, this disregard for </p><p>the complete destruction that befell the Palestinian </p><p>Authority and the Palestinian people is aggravating </p><p>and infuriating." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
