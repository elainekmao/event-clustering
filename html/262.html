<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 00636 </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMCONGEN DUBAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, SOCI, ECON, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  TEHRAN SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCENE </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  WOMEN IN TEHRAN ARE TESTING THE LIMITS </p><p>OF THE LIBERALIZATION OF DRESS CODES BY WEARING </p><p>BRIGHTLY COLORED, FASHIONABLE CLOTHES, BARELY CONCEALED </p><p>BY EQUALLY FASHIONABLE RAINCOATS OR SCARVES. </p><p>BUSINESSMEN BEMOAN THE FAILURE OF THE ECONOMY TO </p><p>REVIVE AFTER THE CEASEFIRE, THOUGH SOME PARTS OF THE </p><p>ECONOMY ARE EXPERIENCING A REVIVAL.  ANTI-ISRAELI </p><p>PROPAGANDA OVERSHADOWS ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA </p><p>ON THE STREETS OF TEHRAN.  THE NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL </p><p>COMPANY STRUGGLES TO OPERATE ON THE EXPERTISE OF A </p><p>TINY MINORITY OF EXPERIENCED WORKERS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  TRAVELLERS FROM TEHRAN REPORT DRAMATIC CHANGES IN </p><p>THE CITY\'S FASHION SCENE.  THE MANAGER OF A MAJOR </p><p>AIRLINE WHO RETURNED FROM A BUSINESS TRIP TO TEHRAN </p><p>A FEW DAYS AGO REPORTS HAVING SEEN WOMEN WEARING BLUE </p><p>JEANS, ALBEIT UNDER THEIR RAINCOATS.  SOURCE ALSO SAW </p><p>DOZENS OF WOMEN WEARING COLORFUL AND BRIGHTLY PRINTED </p><p>SCARVES LOOSELY DRAWN OVER THEIR HEADS.  DURING A RECENT </p><p>VISIT TO DUBAI, THE COUSIN OF DUBAI\'S IRANIAN FSN </p><p>EXPRESSED AMAZEMENT THAT WOMEN HERE DO NOT HIGHLIGHT </p><p>THEIR HAIR.  APPARENTLY, A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN </p><p>IN TEHRAN STREAK THEIR HAIR AND PROMINENTLY DISPLAY </p><p>A BLOND FRINGE OUTSIDE THEIR SCARVES.  THE DRAB RAINCOATS </p><p>USUALLY WORN OVER CLOTHES HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY TRENDY </p><p>EUROPEAN STYLES AND TWO-PIECE SUITS ARE APPEARING WITH </p><p>GREATER FREQUENCY.  (COMMENT:  WHILE CONGEN DUBAI HAS </p><p>BEEN HEARING REPORTS OF LIBERALIZING TRENDS IN DRESS </p><p>CODES FOR SOME TIME NOW, THE AMAZEMENT OF BOTH IRANIAN </p><p>AND WESTERN SOURCES WHO REPORTED THE ABOVE GIVES MUCH </p><p>GREATER WEIGHT TO THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED CHANGES.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  AIRLINE SOURCE REPORTS THAT MANY OF THE IRANIAN </p><p>BUSINESSMEN HE DEALT WITH WERE GREATLY DISPIRITED </p><p>OVER FAILURE OF THE ECONOMY TO PICK UP AFTER THE </p><p>CEASEFIRE.  ON HIS TRIP LAST WEEK, SOURCE NOTED AN </p><p>INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF CONSUMER GOODS OF BETWEEN </p><p>THIRTY AND FIFTY PERCENT SINCE HIS PREVIOUS TRIP TO </p><p>TEHRAN ALMOST A YEAR AGO.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE SAID </p><p>THAT ANYTHING COULD BE HAD IN TEHRAN\'S BLACK MARKET, </p><p>FOR A PRICE.  WHILE THE REST OF THE ECONOMY IS FALTERING </p><p>ONE SEGMENT OF THE ECONOMY IS EXPERIENCING A REVIVAL. </p><p>APPARENTLY, THE WORLD\'S OLDEST PROFESSION IS ONCE AGAIN </p><p>PLYING ITS TRADE IN THE LOBBIES OF TEHRAN\'S PRINCIPAL </p><p>HOTELS.  ACCORDING TO SOURCE, HE WAS REPEATEDLY </p><p>APPROACHED IN A DISCREET MANNER BY WOMEN IN HIS HOTEL. </p><p>THEY WOULD ASK FOR HIS NUMBER AND PROMISE TO CALL LATER </p><p>TO SET UP AN ASSIGNATION.  SUCH ASSIGNATIONS ARE SET </p><p>UP IN PRIVATE RESIDENCES AND NEVER IN HOTELS WHERE THE </p><p>DANGER OF BEING DISCOVERED IS TOO GREAT.  PRICES ARE </p><p>QUITE REASONABLE IF PAID IN HARD CURRENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MOST OF THE PEOPLE AIRLINE SOURCE MET WERE LOATHE </p><p>TO DISCUSS POLITICS OPENLY, AND HE PERCEIVED A GREAT </p><p>FEAR OF THE REVGUARDS AMONG HIS INTERLOCUTORS.  HIS </p><p>CONTACTS WERE ALSO VERY SUSPICIOUS OF EACH OTHER, </p><p>FEARING THAT SOMETHING THEY SAID MIGHT BE REPORTED TO </p><p>THE AUTHORITIES.  ANTI-AMERICAN BANNERS WERE PRESENT </p><p>IN ALL HOTEL LOBBIES BUT HAD BEEN RELEGATED TO </p><p>OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACES.  ON THE OTHER HAND, ANTI-ISRAELI </p><p>POSTERS, BANNERS, AND BILLBOARDS WERE PROMINENTLY </p><p>DISPLAYED THROUGHOUT TEHRAN.  AT THE FIRST ROUNDABOUT </p><p>ON THE ROAD FROM THE AIRPORT INTO TEHRAN, FOUR LARGE </p><p>BILLBOARDS PROCLAIMED IN ENGLISH AND FARSI:  ISRAEL </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE COUSIN OF DUBAI\'S IRANIAN FSN WORKS IN NIOC </p><p>HEADQUARTERS IN TEHRAN IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION. </p><p>IN HER OPINION, THE NIOC IS RUN ON THE STRENGTH OF </p><p>THE EXPERTISE OF A HANDFUL OF ITS 103,000 EMPLOYEES. </p><p>UPPER MANAGEMENT IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON ITS </p><p>SUBORDINATES FOR GUIDANCE IN DECISIONMAKING.  WHENEVER </p><p>THIS EMPLOYEE\'S BOSS GOES INTO A HIGH-LEVEL MEETING, </p><p>HE REMAINS IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH HER BY PHONE </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE MEETING SEEKING HER GUIDANCE ON </p><p>EVERYTHING FROM ROUTINE TO MANAGERIAL ISSUES.  BECAUSE </p><p>SOURCE IS A WOMAN, SHE CANNOT ATTEND THE MEETINGS </p><p>HERSELF.  THE INABILITY OF THE NIOC TO WORK EFFECTIVELY </p><p>IS FURTHER HAMPERED BY DEFICIENCIES IN FOREIGN-LANGUAGE </p><p>CAPABILITY AMONG ITS EMPLOYEES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MACK </p><p></p></div>
