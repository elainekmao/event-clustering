MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPERS CONTINUE TO RUN OPINION PIECES </p><p>   FOCUSING ON THE WAR AGAINST TERROR.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW: </p><p> </p><p>2.   UNDER HEADLINE "NEW FACE OF TERRORISM TARGETS </p><p>   EVERYBODY," THE NOVEMBER 4 EDITION OF THE </p><p>   GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED WEEKLY "THE SUNDAY MAIL" CARRIED </p><p>   THE FOLLOWING PIECE BY ITS U.S.-BASED CORRESPONDENT </p><p>   TENDAYI KUMBULA: </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .THE NEW FACE OF TERRORISM TARGETS EVERYBODY.  THE </p><p>   SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS. . .DID NOT SELECT VICTIMS ON THE </p><p>   BASIS OF RACE, COLOR, ETHNICITY, CREED, RELIGION, </p><p>   RESIDENCE OR ECONOMIC CLASS.  ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAD </p><p>   HAPPENED TO BE ON THE FOUR HIJACKED PLANES OR THE </p><p>   BUILDINGS THAT THE PLANES CRASHED INTO WERE FAIR GAME </p><p>   AND TARGETS.  TODAY THE REALIZATION THAT TERRORISM IS </p><p>   NOT A GAME AND IS NOT A HOLLYWOOD CREATION HAS HIT HOME. </p><p>   THERE IS NO PANIC YET.  BUT AMERICANS ARE CONCERNED, </p><p>   CONFUSED AND SCARED. . .  FOR THE FIRST TIME, AMERICANS </p><p>   ARE DEALING WITH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE REST OF </p><p>   THE WORLD HAS FACED OVER THE YEARS.  IT IS NOT A </p><p>   COMFORTABLE OR COMFORTING SITUATION TO BE IN, ESPECIALLY </p><p>   SINCE THIS IS A BATTLE WITH NO CLEARLY DEFINED </p><p>   PARAMETERS OR RULES OF BEHAVIOR. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>3.   UNDER HEADLINE "GLOBAL TENSIONS OVER AFGHANISTAN </p><p>   THREATEN WORLD WAR," THE SAME NEWSPAPER CARRIED THE </p><p>   FOLLOWING OPINION PIECE BY ITS REGULAR COLUMNIST </p><p>   TAFATAONA MAHOSO: </p><p> </p><p>   "THE UNITED NATIONS IS IGNORING IMPORTANT WARNINGS FROM </p><p>   ISRAEL, INDIA, SYRIA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN AND IRAQ ABOUT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03302  051421Z </p><p>   THE WAY THE SO-CALLED WAR AGAINST TERROR IS BEING </p><p>   CONDUCTED.  IT IS UNUSUAL FOR SAUDI ARABIA TO CONTRADICT </p><p>   THE U.S. FOREIGN POLICY.  THEREFORE SAUDI FEARS AND </p><p>   DOUBTS INDICATE A PERCEPTION OF REAL DANGER. . .  THE </p><p>   ANGLO-AMERICAN RESPONSE TO ATTACKS ON NEW YORK AND </p><p>   WASHINGTON ON 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 IS CONTRARY TO THE </p><p>   LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE BEIJING DECLARATION. . .  THE </p><p>   U.S. AND ITS ALLIES ARE ONCE MORE TARGETING ENTIRE </p><p>   CITIES AND VILLAGES IN PURSUIT OF THEIR OWN QUARREL WITH </p><p>   AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON AND ORGANIZATION WHO AT ONE TIME </p><p>   ACTUALLY SERVED AS AN INSTRUMENT OF U.S. FOREIGN </p><p>   POLICY. . .  THE STRENGTH OF SAUDI OBJECTIONS TO ANGLO- </p><p>   AMERICAN PREPARATIONS FOR WAR SUGGESTS THAT THE SAUDIS </p><p>   KNOW THAT THE OBJECTIVE IS MUCH WIDER AND MORE </p><p>   INDEFINITE THAN A \'STRIKE AGAINST TERROR.\'" </p><p> </p><p>4.   MEANWHILE THE NOVEMBER 2 EDITION OF THE </p><p>   GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" CARRIED AN </p><p>   OP-ED BY AMBASSADOR JOSEPH SULLIVAN UNDER HEADLINE "ALL </p><p>   PEOPLE VULNERABLE TO TERROR."   THIS IS THE THIRD </p><p>   PROMINENT PLACEMENT FOLLOWING PRIOR PUBLICATIONS IN THE </p><p>   NOVEMBER 1 EDITIONS OF THE PRIVATELY-OWNED "THE DAILY </p><p>   NEWS" AND THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL </p><p>   GAZETTE." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
