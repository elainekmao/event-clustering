<p>UNCLAS ADANA 0080 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA AND PRM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  POPULATION MOVEMENT IN NORTHERN </p><p>          IRAQ NOT TOWARD TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  According to contacts in </p><p>southeastern Turkey, population movements in </p><p>northern Iraq in anticipation of war are not </p><p>toward the Turkish border.  Rather, those on the </p><p>move are generally seeking to leave cities for </p><p>the perceived safety of villages higher up in the </p><p>hills.  The Habur gate is calm for now.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  With the situation in northern Iraq </p><p>quite fluid, we offer the following information </p><p>relayed to us on March 18 by various contacts in </p><p>southeastern Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hakkari </p><p>:::::::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU)  The mayor of Hakkari and one of our </p><p>Hakkari human-rights contacts both confirm that </p><p>they have received no information about refugees </p><p>heading toward Hakkari province\'s border with </p><p>Iraq.   That border is covered with snow, they </p><p>note. Their contacts in northern Iraq have spoken </p><p>of internal refugee movements within northern </p><p>Iraq only. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sirnak </p><p>:::::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The UNHCR Coordinator in Silopi, who </p><p>has been travelling extensively, said he had </p><p>neither seen nor heard of refugee movement toward </p><p>the Turkish border for now.  He believed the </p><p>pattern of internal movement inside northern Iraq </p><p>consists of people leaving cities (notably Mosul </p><p>and Dohuk) for the countryside, particularly the </p><p>mountains.  The migrants\' logic is that cities </p><p>are perceived as more likely to be attacked. </p><p>Sirnak province\'s Habur gate between Turkey and </p><p>Iraq is very calm at the moment, he said, </p><p>something that was confirmed by an oil-trader in </p><p>Silopi who has good contacts in northern Iraq. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
