AMBASSADOR SEMBLER MET WITH GIANNI LETTA, </p><p>U/S AT THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, ON JULY 26 </p><p>TO PURSUE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL REFTEL DEMARCHES ON THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) AND OPERATION ENDURING </p><p>FREEDOM (OEF) TROOP CONTRIBUTIONS. AMB. SEMBLER URGED THE GOI </p><p>TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH THE USG SOON TO </p><p>ENSURE PROTECTION FOR US TROOPS AGAINST IMPROPER APPLICATIONS </p><p>OF THE ICC\'S JURISDICTION.  HE URGED THAT BERLUSCONI MAKE A </p><p>STRONG STATEMENT OF RECOMMENDATION TO PARLIAMENT THAT ITALY </p><p>CONTRIBUTE GROUND TROOPS OR SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF OEF.  LETTA, WHO IS BERLUSCONI\'S CLOSEST ADVISOR, </p><p>AGREED TO RAISE BOTH ISSUES WITH THE PM.  WE EXPECT A REPLY </p><p>EARLY NEXT WEEK.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>OEF TROOP CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  COMMENTS BY PM BERLUSCONI ON JULY 24 REGARDING </p><p>ITALY\'S TROOP DEPLOYMENT IN SUPPORT OF OEF (SEPTEL) OPENED </p><p>THE WAY FOR AMB. SEMBLER TO EMPHASIZE TO LETTA THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF A COMMITMENT OF GROUND TROOPS OR SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES </p><p>TO REPLACE UNITS ROTATING OUT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT ONLY 379 ITALIAN TROOPS CURRENTLY WERE </p><p>DEPLOYED FOR OEF (307 ON A FRIGATE IN THE ARABIAN SEA), </p><p>RATHER THAN THE 1,000 TROOPS BERLUSCONI HAD MENTIONED DURING </p><p>HIS SPEECH TO ITALIAN AMBASSADORS.  HE AND LETTA AGREED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03703  01 OF 02  261604Z </p><p>THE PM WAS LIKELY REFERRING TO ITALIAN TROOPS SUPPORTING BOTH </p><p>OEF AND ISAF, WHICH TOGETHER INCLUDE OVER 800 SOLDIERS AND </p><p>CARABINIERI (379 IN OEF PLUS 454 IN ISAF).  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOTED THAT THE ORIGINAL OFFER APPROVED BY PARLIAMENT LAST </p><p>NOVEMBER INCLUDED GROUND TROOPS AND SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES </p><p>THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CALLED UPON...UNTIL NOW.  (IN HIS SPEECH, </p><p>BERLUSCONI, AND LATER DEFENSE MINISTER MARTINO, STATED THAT </p><p>PARLIAMENT WOULD NEED TO REVIEW A REQUEST TO DEPLOY TROOPS.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AMB. SEMBLER TOLD LETTA THAT HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>THE DELAY A PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW WOULD CAUSE, PARTICULARLY </p><p>GIVEN THE IMPENDING PARLIAMENTARY RECESS UNTIL MID-SEPTEMBER. </p><p> HE STRESSED THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT ITALY INDICATE A </p><p>POSITIVE INTENT TO HELP, NOW THAT THE US IS ASKING FOR </p><p>SPECIFIC ASSISTANCE.  A/DCM NOTED THAT WE WOULD HOPE A MAJOR </p><p>NATO ALLY WOULD RESPOND MORE QUICKLY THAN SOME OF THE SMALLER </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT ARE PREPARING TO STEP FORWARD.  (NOTE: </p><p>FOLLOWING THE MEETING, THE PRESS REPORTED ALBANIA\'S PLANS TO </p><p>SEND A 30-MAN SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAM -- TRAINED BY ITALIANS </p><p>-- TO AFGHANISTAN ON AUGUST 5. END NOTE.)  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>PROPOSED THAT THE PM RECOMMEND TO PARLIAMENT THAT GROUND </p><p>TROOPS OR SPECIAL OPERATION FORCES BE CONTRIBUTED TO OEF -- A </p><p>COMMITMENT THAT WILL CLEARLY SHOW THAT BERLUSCONI AND HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT ARE WITH THE US IN THIS FIGHT.  HE MENTIONED HIS </p><p>MEETING WITH THE PM LAST MARCH WHEN BERLUSCONI MADE AN </p><p>ON-THE-SPOT DECISION, AGAINST THE PREFERENCES OF HIS MILITARY </p><p>ADVISORS, TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR THE FORMER AFGHAN KING -- </p><p>THAT KIND OF IMMEDIATE POLITICAL COMMITMENT WAS CALLED FOR </p><p>HERE, THE AMBASSADOR SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) LETTA PROMISED TO CONVEY TO THE PM OUR REQUEST THAT A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03703  01 OF 02  261604Z </p><p>COMMITMENT BE MADE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN WAITING </p><p>UNTIL MID-SEPTEMBER.  HE EXPLAINED THAT PARLIAMENT\'S APPROVAL </p><p>OF ITALY\'S PARTICIPATION IN OEF LAST NOVEMBER INCLUDED THE </p><p>CONDITION THAT ANY SIGNIFICANT VARIATION WOULD BE SUBJECT TO </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW.  WHILE HE DIDN\'T FORESEE ANY PROBLEMS, </p><p>A PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW COULD NOT BE AVOIDED.  LETTA AGREED </p><p>THAT A MAJOR ALLY LIKE ITALY SHOULD BE AMONG THE FIRST TO </p><p>OFFER TO CONTRIBUTE.  HE SAID HE WILL RELAY BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>RESPONSE EARLY NEXT WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>ICC </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AMB. SEMBLER STRESSED THAT THE USG IS NOT WORKING TO </p><p>UNDERMINE THE ICC.  RATHER, WE WANT TO USE ARTICLE 98 OF THE </p><p>ROME TREATY TO NEGOTIATE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE THE </p><p>PROTECTION WE DEEM NECESSARY FOR OUR SOLDIERS AGAINST </p><p>POSSIBLE POLITICAL MISUSE OF THE COURT.  HE NOTED THAT SOME </p><p>OF THE SAME COUNTRIES THAT URGED THE US TO RELY ON ARTICLE 98 </p><p>AGREEMENTS AS A WAY AROUND THE IMPASSE OVER THE BOSNIA POLICE </p><p>MISSION MANDATE WERE NOW RESISTING THE IDEA.  HE URGED THAT </p><p>BERLUSCONI TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE AS A KEY NATO ALLY AND </p><p>AGREE TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH US.  AN </p><p>EXTENDED ANALYSIS BY GOI LAWYERS WOULD NOT BE HELPFUL; WHAT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4322 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03703  02 OF 02  261605Z </p><p>ACTION SWCI-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    JUSE-00  L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------D0BBB7  261605Z /38 </p><p>O 261559Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5124 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 003703 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR U/S BOLTON, AMB.

LETTA NOTED THAT THE PM </p><p>HAD PUBLICLY STATED THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THE USG\'S CONCERNS </p><p>AND RECOGNIZES THE CAPABILITY OF US COURTS TO HANDLE SUCH </p><p>CASES.  HE SAID HE WOULD REVIEW THE BOILERPLATE ARTICLE 98 </p><p>AGREEMENT WE PASSED TO HIM, DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH </p><p>BERLUSCONI AND HIS STAFF, AND REPLY TO US NEXT WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>6.

IT </p><p>WILL TAKE REAL LEADERSHIP BY BERLUSCONI TO RISK ROCKING THE </p><p>EU BOAT BY BEING THE FIRST TO START ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  HE WILL ALSO LIKELY ENCOUNTER SOME DOMESTIC </p><p>RESISTANCE TO COMMITING TROOPS TO AFGHANISTAN, SOMETHING HE </p><p>AND HIS DEFENSE MINISTER HAVE BEEN HOPING TO AVOID.  WE WOULD </p><p>NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE PM\'S SOLUTION IS TO MAKE A PERSONAL </p><p>BUT CONFIDENTIAL COMMITMENT TO PRESS PARLIAMENT FOR RAPID </p><p>APPROVAL IN SEPTEMBER, WITHOUT MAKING IT A MATTER OF PUBLIC </p><p>DISCUSSION BEFORE THEN.
