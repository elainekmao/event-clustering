SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST: IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC EROSION IN THE PREVIOUSLY </p><p>GENEROUS HEALTH BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE UAEG TO NON- </p><p>CITIZEN RESIDENTS.  THE HIGHEST HEALTHCARE COSTS IN THE </p><p>GULF REGION, COMBINED WITH DECREASING GOVERNMENT </p><p>SUBSIDIES IN RECENT YEARS, HAVE FORCED THE UAEG TO </p><p>CHARGE EXPATRIATES FOR NEARLY ALL HEALTH SERVICES. </p><p>SINCE 1996, THE UAEG HAS REQUIRED EXPATRIATES TO HOLD A </p><p>HEALTH CARD -- ISSUED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, A LOCAL </p><p>HOSPITAL, OR A PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY -- AS A </p><p>PREREQUISITE FOR A RESIDENCY PERMIT.  THE UAE MINISTER </p><p>OF HEALTH RECENTLY ADMITTED TO LOCAL REPORTERS, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THE HEALTH CARD SCHEME HAS NOT WORKED, AND </p><p>EXPATRIATES IN REALITY PAY FOR MOST OF THEIR MEDICAL </p><p>TREATMENT.  MANY PEOPLE ARE UNABLE FINANCIALLY TO COVER </p><p>THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE COSTS, AND THEREFORE DELAY </p><p>TREATMENT AND ENDANGER THEIR HEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST CONTINUED:  IN SPRING </p><p>2001, THE UAEG ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO MAKE IT COMPULSORY </p><p>FOR EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE PRIVATE MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR </p><p>EXPATRIATE WORKERS.  PROGRESS ON CODIFICATION OF THIS </p><p>LEGISLATION HAS BEEN SLOW, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE </p><p>COMPLICATED CONSENSUS-BASED DECISION-MAKING PROCESS OF </p><p>THE UAE BUREAUCRACY.  COMPARATOR COMPANIES AND </p><p>COUNTERPART DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS DETERMINED IN 2001 THAT </p><p>INSURING THEIR EMPLOYEES WAS A DE FACTO REQUIREMENT, </p><p>DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF A LAW.  POST REITERATES ITS </p><p>REQUEST TO WASHINGTON TO BUDGET FOR FSN HEALTH INSURANCE </p><p>IN FY04.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE UAE IS BROKEN </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE UAE </p><p>DISCRIMINATES AGAINST EXPATRIATE WORKERS -- WHO COMPRISE </p><p>MORE THAN 85 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY\'S POPULATION AND 98 </p><p>PERCENT OF PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS.  UAE NATIONALS PAY </p><p>BETWEEN 25 DIRHAMS (US $6.80) AND 100 DIRHAMS (US </p><p>$27.23) FOR A HEALTH CARD THAT ENTITLES THEM TO LARGELY </p><p>FREE HEALTH CARE FOR FOUR YEARS.  EXPATRIATES, ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, ARE CHARGED BETWEEN 100 DIRHAMS (US $27.23) </p><p>AND 300 DIRHAMS (US $81.68) FOR A HEALTH CARD FOR ONE </p><p>YEAR, WITH ADDITIONAL FEES FOR ROUTINE HEALTHCARE </p><p>SERVICES -- 50 DIRHAMS (YS $13.61) FOR EACH X-RAY OR </p><p>ULTRASOUND, 75 DIRHAMS (US $20.45) FOR AN INTRAVENOUS </p><p>PYELOGRAM, OR 100 DIRHAMS (US $27.23) FOR A CT SCAN. </p><p>SINCE 2001, EXPATRIATES HAVE PAID FOR ALL MEDICATIONS. </p><p>SUCH CHARGES CAN BE A HUGE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON OUR FSNS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PRICES FOR PHARMACEUTICALS AND SOME MEDICAL TESTS IN </p><p>THE UAE ARE NOW 20-30 PERCENT HIGHER THAN IN THE REST OF </p><p>THE GULF, AND MORE THAN 50 PERCENT HIGHER THAN PRICES OF </p><p>SIMILAR PRODUCTS IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT.  THIS IS AN </p><p>UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCE OF POST\'S EFFORTS TO ENSURE UAE </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH ITS WTO PATENT PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS. </p><p>AS THE RESULT OF WASHINGTON\'S AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TO RID </p><p>THE UAE MARKET OF CHEAP ILLEGAL COPIES OF PATENT- </p><p>PROTECTED MEDICINES, THE UAE HEALTH SECTOR NOW IS </p><p>LARGELY DEPENDENT ON DRUGS FROM EUROPE AND THE UNITED </p><p>STATES -- IN TURN PUSHING UP PRICES OF BASIC MEDICINES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>COMPULSORY PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IS THE SOLUTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE QUASI-PARLIAMENTARY FEDERAL NATIONAL COUNCIL </p><p>FIRST RAISED MANDATORY EMPLOYER-PROVIDED PRIVATE HEALTH </p><p>INSURANCE IN 1999.  THE PROPOSITION WAS RECOGNITION BY </p><p>THE UAEG THAT ITS CURRENT HEALTH CARD SCHEME FALLS SHORT </p><p>OF PROVIDING BASIC HEALTH SERVICES TO THE UAE\'S MORE </p><p>THAN 3 MILLION EXPATRIATE WORKERS.  THE UAEG, HOWEVER, </p><p>MAY NEVER SIGN THE PLAN INTO LAW.  THE UAE\'S CONFEDERAL </p><p>STRUCTURE REQUIRES THAT THE RULERS OF ALL SEVEN EMIRATES </p><p>RATIFY LEGISLATION, THE PRESIDENT GIVES HIS FINAL </p><p>APPROVAL, AND THE LAW IS PUBLISHED AS OFFICIAL -- A </p><p>LENGTHY AND DIFFICULT PROCESS THAT HAS MIRED MANY GOOD </p><p>PROPOSITIONS IN THE BUREAUCRACY FOR YEARS.  POLITICAL </p><p>SENSITIVITIES AND SECURITY CONCERNS ALSO HINDER THE </p><p>PROVISION OF CODIFIED RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES FOR THE </p><p>UAE\'S MASSIVE FOREIGN POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>PREVAILING PRACTICE: MANDATORY HEALTH INSURANCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6.  PROPOSITIONS, SUCH AS MANDATORY HEALTH INSURANCE, </p><p>OFTEN ARE THE PREVAILING PRACTICE WITHOUT EVER BECOMING </p><p>OFFICIAL LEGISLATION.  AS PART AND PARCEL OF THEIR </p><p>EFFORTS TO PROVIDE A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT AND </p><p>ACCEPTABLE LIVING STANDARDS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES, OUR </p><p>COMPARATORS AND MANY OTHER LOCAL EMPLOYERS ARE PROVIDING </p><p>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE TO STAFF.  COUNTERPART </p><p>DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS (AUSTRALIA AND UNITED KINGDOM) </p><p>DETERMINED IN 2001 THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE </p><p>HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEIR STAFF.  THE UAE\'S MONOPOLY </p><p>TELECOM PROVIDER AND LARGEST EMPLOYER RECENTLY </p><p>CONTRACTED A NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY TO PROVIDE </p><p>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR ITS MORE THAN 20,000 STAFF </p><p>COUNTRYWIDE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>DELAY OF FSN HEALTH INSURANCE HAS TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>  7.   ALTHOUGH NO ONE CAN PREDICT WHETHER A TRAGIC DEATH COULD </p><p>      HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY THE PROVISION OF BETTER HEALTH CARE, OUR </p><p>      EMBASSY FAMILY HAS SUFFERED RECENT LOSSES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>      AVOIDED BY BETTER HEALTH CARE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN MAY 2003, AN </p><p>      EMBASSY DRIVER WHO WAS ONLY ONE WEEK AWAY FROM RETIREMENT </p><p>      SUDDENLY DIED FROM A PROBABLE HEART ATTACK.  HE PREVIOUSLY HAD </p><p>      SOUGHT TREATMENT FOR CHEST PAINS AT THE EMBASSY HEALTH UNIT, BU </p><p>      TOLD HIS SUPERVISOR THAT HE WAS DELAYING THE RECOMMENDED FOLLOW </p><p>      UP CARE UNTIL HE RETURNED TO INDIA -- WHERE HE COULD AFFORD </p><p>      TREATMENT.  ALTHOUGH POST\'S HEALTH UNIT HAS IMPLEMENTED A PROGR </p><p>      OF REGULAR MEDICAL REVIEWS OF DRIVERS AND OTHER FSN EMPLOYEES, </p><p>      THE LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE CONTINUES TO DISSUADE OUR EMPLOYEE </p><p>      FROM SEEKING FOLLOW-UP CARE AT LOCAL HEALTH FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>  8.   CONCLUSION/ACTION REQUEST:  WHILE THE UAEG HAS YET TO PASS </p><p>      LEGISLATION (AND MAY NEVER DO SO) FOR MANDATORY EMPLOYER-PROVID </p><p>      HEALTH INSURANCE, THEY ARE RELYING ON THE FACTS ON THE GROUND T </p><p>      SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  AS MENTIONED IN PARA 6, MOST INSTITUTIONS A </p><p>      NOW PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE AND WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THE U.S. </p><p>      MISSION SHOULD AS WELL.  POST REQUESTS BUDGET ALLOCATION TO FUN </p><p>      FSN HEALTH INSURANCE AS OF SEPTEMBER 21, 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
