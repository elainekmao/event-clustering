<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001484 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:08/05/03 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, NP, IN, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: INDIAN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR PLEDGES TO </p><p>COORDINATE WITH THE US IN CONTACTS WITH NEPAL\'S MAOISTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) KATHMANDU 1461 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary.  According to the Indian Ambassador to </p><p>Nepal, India\'s National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra </p><p>has reaffirmed the Indian Government\'s (GOI\'s) policy of </p><p>synchronizing with the U.S. its tough talking points for </p><p>Nepal\'s Maoist leaders.  Mishra reportedly also pledged </p><p>that his Government, in its dialogue with the Maoists, </p><p>has never encouraged the militants to attack or to </p><p>threaten US interests in Nepal.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Shyam Saran, Indian Ambassador to Nepal, called on </p><p>the Ambassador on August 4 to report on the results of </p><p>his promised efforts (reftel) to ensure that no agency of </p><p>the GOI was giving Nepal\'s Maoists the impression that it </p><p>condoned attacks or threats on US interests here.  Saran </p><p>said that in order to ensure that he received an </p><p>authoritative statement of GOI policy, undistorted by </p><p>possibly conflicting agendas of different foreign affairs </p><p>agencies, he went right to the top--talking by phone to </p><p>Principal Secretary and National Security Advisor Brajesh </p><p>Mishra. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) With evident satisfaction Saran reported that </p><p>Mishra had confirmed unequivocally that no agency of the </p><p>GOI has ever been authorized to make any statement </p><p>encouraging Nepal\'s Maoists to attack or to threaten US </p><p>interests in Nepal.  Mishra reportedly went on to say </p><p>that he had never felt that the US and India are </p><p>operating at cross purposes in our respective policies </p><p>toward Nepal and the Maoists.  Mishra said he had made </p><p>this point repeatedly in his candid discussions at higher </p><p>levels of the USG, including with his counterpart, Dr. </p><p>Rice.  Ranjit Rae, Joint Secretary for Nepal and Bhutan </p><p>in the Foreign Ministry, would be underscoring this point </p><p>to the US Embassy in New Delhi on behalf of Mishra, Saran </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Saran went on to explain that the GOI would </p><p>continue to adhere to the basic talking points with the </p><p>Maoists to which he and the Ambassador had agreed.  As he </p><p>expressed them, these points are the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- The nature of the GOI\'s relations with the Maoists </p><p>would be determined by the actions of the Maoists </p><p>themselves.  If the Maoists wanted to be treated by the </p><p>GOI as a legitimate political party they would have to </p><p>give up violence and terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>-- If, as all Indian intelligence now indicates, the </p><p>Maoists continue to engage in such criminal behavior on </p><p>Indian soil as gun running and cooperation with Indian </p><p>Naxalites, the Indian Government may attack them. </p><p> </p><p>-- If the Maoists are truly committed, as they say, to </p><p>multiparty democracy, they must end threats of violence </p><p>against their political opponents and provide a level </p><p>playing field for other parties to operate in areas where </p><p>the Maoists are active militarily.  In particular, no </p><p>election to a constituent assembly (a persistent Maoist </p><p>demand) or any other body would be possible under the </p><p>threat of Maoist guns. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Saran caveated the foregoing points by asserting </p><p>that his government had had no direct contact with the </p><p>Maoists in New Delhi.  He said that reports that the </p><p>Maoist leadership, now in India, had sent a letter to the </p><p>GOI requesting its support for going back to war against </p><p>the Nepal Government had not been substantiated; no such </p><p>letter had been received by the GOI.  He confirmed that </p><p>his DCM had had a single meeting with Baburam Bhatterai </p><p>in Kathmandu and "some of his folks" h </p><p>ad met with Maoist </p><p>spokesman Mahara.  He added that Indian officials have </p><p>met on occasion with Maoist surrogates or "go betweens." </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Comment.  Amb Saran\'s quick response to the issues </p><p>that the Ambassador had raised with him just three days </p><p>earlier (reftel) strengthens our high regard for him as a </p><p>sincere and cooperative colleague.  However disingenuous, </p><p>his denial that his government has established a </p><p>continuing dialogue with the Maoist leadership is not </p><p>surprising given the sensitive nature of that dialogue. </p><p>The clear affirmation by the National Security Advisor </p><p>that the GOI wants to coordinate with the U.S. its overt </p><p>policy toward Nepal and the Maoists is good news, as is </p><p>his statement that the GOI is not encouraging the Maoists </p><p>to oppose US interests here.  It is still possible, of </p><p>course, that lower-ranking officers of the Research and </p><p>Analysis Wing (RAW) have encouraged the Maoists to oppose </p><p>US activities and influence in Nepal without </p><p>authorization and without reporting these comments to </p><p>senior GOI officials.  All this underscores how far we </p><p>have come in establishing a constructive dialogue with </p><p>the Indians on Nepal, and how far we have yet to go to </p><p>gain their full cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
