(C) A FEBRUARY 18 JOINT SESSION OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEES OF THE CROATIAN </p><p>PARLIAMENT FAILED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY LINE ON </p><p>IRAQ.  PREDICTABLY, THE FAILURE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IRAQ, </p><p>BUT WITH THE COALITION\'S INCOMPETENCE AND THE OPPOSITION\'S </p><p>OPPORTUNISM.  SINCE THE SESSION PRODUCED NO CONCRETE RESULT, </p><p>PARLIAMENT SPEAKER ZLATKO TOMCIC WILL LIKELY CALL FOR A </p><p>BROADER DEBATE OF THE GOC IRAQ POLICY DURING THE NEXT PLENARY </p><p>SESSION OF THE SABOR, WHICH MAY TURN OUT TO BE EVEN MORE </p><p>DISRUPTIVE.  WHILE PM RACAN AND SOME OTHERS (INCLUDING WE) </p><p>TRY TO STEER THE DEBATE IN CROATIA TO SADDAM AND IRAQ, MOST </p><p>OF THE POLITICAL CHATTERING CLASS HERE CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON </p><p>HOW THE GOC\'S POLICY STATEMENTS ON IRAQ WILL AFFECT CROATIA\'S </p><p>APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP AND ON VARIOUS POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES\' FORTUNES IN AN ELECTION YEAR. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE GOC DECISION TO JOIN THE VILNIUS-10 DECLARATION </p><p>OF SUPPORT TO THE USG INTERPRETATION OF IRAQ\'S NONCOMPLIANCE </p><p>WITH UNSCR 1441 TOOK MOST OF CROATIA\'S POLITICAL LEADERS BY </p><p>SURPRISE.  WHILE MESIC TOOK THE CABINET\'S ABRUPT POLICY </p><p>CHOICE MORE OR LESS IN HIS STRIDE, THE PARLIAMENT (SABOR) GOT </p><p>ITS NOSE OUT OF JOINT.  INSISTING ON ITS CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>PREROGATIVE AS CROATIA\'S SUPREME POLITICAL BODY, THE SABOR </p><p>SCHEDULED A JOINT SESSION OF THE COMMITTEES ON NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS (REFTEL).  THE MEETING WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00393  01 OF 02  211406Z </p><p>DELAYED A WEEK AS THE PM WAS BUSY ABROAD DRUMMING UP SUPPORT </p><p>FOR CROATIA\'S EU BID, BUT IT FINALLY CONVENED IN CLOSED (BUT </p><p>VERY LEAKY) SESSION ON FEBRUARY 18.  IN ADVANCE OF THE </p><p>MEETING, THE EMBASSY PROVIDED BOTH COMMITTEES TRANSLATIONS OF </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL\'S FEBRUARY 5 INTERVENTION AT THE UN SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>COUNCIL AND SEVERAL OTHER SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AS THE COALITION HOLDS A SLIM MAJORITY IN BOTH </p><p>COMMITTEES, THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A </p><p>FOREGONE CONCLUSION.  ANTE MARKOV (HSS), CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE, MADE SURE OF ALL OF HIS VOTES </p><p>WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE MEETING (WE HAD ADMONISHED HIM NOT TO </p><p>PLAY POLITICS ON IRAQ - REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ZDRAVKO TOMAC, WHO CHAIRS THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEE AND IS A MEMBER OF PM RACAN\'S SDP, FAILED TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF HIS COMMITTEE WHO ARE ON THE </p><p>COALITION WERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING.  TOMAC HAS BEEN A </p><p>RIGHT-WING, KNOW-IT-ALL IRRITANT TO RACAN WITHIN THE SDP </p><p>SINCE THE COALITION CAME TO POWER IN 2000, BUT THE PM -- WHO </p><p>IS ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE SDP -- HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO </p><p>BRING HIM INTO LINE.  IN THE RUNUP TO THIS JOINT COMMITTEE </p><p>SESSION, TOMAC THREATENED TO QUIT THE SDP (AFTER HIS SISTER </p><p>WAS FIRED FROM HER POSITION AS ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR </p><p>VETERANS AFFAIRS). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE OPPOSITION HDZ, WHICH REMAINS LARGELY </p><p>UNRECONSTRUCTED FROM THE CORRUPT, NATIONALIST DAYS OF </p><p>PRESIDENT TUDJMAN, HAS TAKEN A STRONG POSITION IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>USG EFFORTS ON IRAQ.  BUT WITHOUT ALL OF THE COALITION </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESENT, THE OPPOSITION COULD NOT PASS UP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00393  01 OF 02  211406Z </p><p>THE CHANCE TO DELIVER A POLITICAL DEFEAT TO PM RACAN.  THE </p><p>OPPOSITION ABSTAINED FROM THE COMMITTEE VOTE, WHICH MEANT </p><p>THAT WITH TWO FRINGE-PARTY VOTES AGAINST AND TWO COALITION </p><p>VOTES PLAYING HOOKY, THE COMMITTEE DID NOT SUPPORT THE GOC </p><p>POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 19 POST-MORTEM MEETING, OPPOSITION MP </p><p>AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE MEMBER VESNA SKARE-OZBOLT </p><p>SHEEPISHLY ADMITTED TO US THAT THE ONLY REASON THE HDZ AND </p><p>HER PARTY, THE RIGHT-OF-CENTER DEMOCRATIC CENTER (DC), VOTED </p><p>AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT POSITION WAS ELECTION-YEAR POLITICS. </p><p>THE DECISION TO ABSTAIN WAS MADE ON THE DAY OF THE COMMITTEE </p><p>MEETING, WHEN HDZ PRESIDENT SANADER COUNTED NOSES AND SAW </p><p>THAT THE COALITION WOULD LOSE WITHOUT THEM.  THE HDZ, WHICH </p><p>IS DESPERATE TO GET THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY (AND </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE USG) TO GIVE ITS SEAL OF APPROVAL TO ITS </p><p>FAR-FROM-COMPLETE INTERNAL REFORM PROCESS, PHONED POLOFF </p><p>AFTER THE VOTE TO TRY AND REASSURE US THAT THE HDZ POSITION </p><p>ON IRAQ REMAINS STAUNCHLY PRO-USG.  THE HDZ ISSUED A PRESS </p><p>RELEASE THE FOLLOWING DAY WITH THE SAME MESSAGE, BUT ADDING A </p><p>LINE ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT IT IS NOT THE OPPOSITION\'S </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO DELIVER THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4534 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00393  02 OF 02  211406Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NRRC-00  NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /005W </p><p>                  ------------------3956CD  211406Z /38 </p><p>O 211400Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9513 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000393 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, HR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: JUST ANOTHER POLITICAL FOOTBALL FOR CROATIAN </p><p>POLS </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00393  02 OF 02  211406Z </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) NO FOLLOW-UP MEETING TO THE JOINT SESSION HAS BEEN </p><p>SCHEDULED, BUT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT PARLIAMENT SPEAKER ZLATKO </p><p>TOMCIC (HSS) WILL LET THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY CHOICE STAND </p><p>WITHOUT THE SABOR MARKING ITS TERRITORY.  RIGHT NOW, THE </p><p>COALITION PARTIES HAVE SUSPENDED THEIR DIFFERENCES IN ORDER </p><p>TO PRESENT A UNITED FRONT AS CROATIA SUBMITS ITS APPLICATION </p><p>TO THE EUROPEAN UNION (SIGNED ON FEBRUARY 20 AND SCHEDULED </p><p>FOR DELIVERY IN ATHENS ON FEBRUARY 21).  BUT IT WON\'T BE LONG </p><p>BEFORE THE BELL RINGS TO SIGNAL THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT </p><p>ROUND, AND IRAQ WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE HOTTEST POLITICAL </p><p>POTATO IN ZAGREB.  DESPITE POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS OUTSIDE OF </p><p>CROATIA, POLITICIANS HERE WILL USE THIS ISSUE TO GAIN </p><p>ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR OPPONENTS IN THIS ELECTION YEAR. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
