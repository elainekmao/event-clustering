<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002204 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories published in all papers today, May 6, </p><p>report on "the U.S.-Israeli campaign" to change the </p><p>Palestinian leadership and Prime Minister Sharon\'s </p><p>visit to the United States.  Papers also carry wire </p><p>service reports featuring excerpts from remarks made </p><p>by the National Security Advisor about the </p><p>"unacceptable" situation in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Sharon\'s files" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(05/06):  "The right-wing U.S. administration proved </p><p>that it is the most biased in favor of Israel in the </p><p>entire history of America.  This administration has </p><p>supported Sharon\'s war and policies in such a flagrant </p><p>and blatant manner, after it was chosen as the only </p><p>godfather of peace in this region.  After Sharon\'s </p><p>massacres and slaughters in Jenin and Nablus, we </p><p>believe that this administration will not be able to </p><p>hold on in the face of Arab and international protests </p><p>and condemnations.  It will not be able to defend </p><p>Sharon\'s wars much longer.  The Israeli prime minister </p><p>has fully depended on America\'s political and media </p><p>support in his dirty war against the Palestinians.  In </p><p>return however, the Palestinian cause received </p><p>unprecedented support on the level of the people and </p><p>organizations.  This will surely affect America\'s bias </p><p>for Israel and will force Washington, sooner or later, </p><p>to shy away from supporting a man, whose history is </p><p>filled with horrible massacres." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Worrying American stances" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/06) editorializes:  "Washington, having went to </p><p>extremes in its pressure on the Palestinian leadership </p><p>and in politically administering the Israeli </p><p>operations, now goes back to instigating against the </p><p>Palestinian leadership.  What is there left of the </p><p>American vision [for a comprehensive political </p><p>solution] when Washington wages a war of siege with </p><p>the Israeli generals and rabbis?  What negotiations </p><p>and what international conference when all the Arab </p><p>parties who want to see an end to the occupation, are </p><p>undergoing the worst type of American classifications? </p><p>What peace and what political process can Washington </p><p>launch when it is waging its own wars to oust the </p><p>Palestinian leadership, to isolate Syria and to </p><p>pressure Lebanon?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Zionist movement and the U.S. administration" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mazen Saket writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/06):  "The clarity of the relationship and the </p><p>alliance between the U.S. administration and the </p><p>Zionist movement proves the anti-Arab stand of the </p><p>United States and the failure of those who claim that </p><p>the United States can have the honest broker\'s role in </p><p>a political settlement.  This proves that the United </p><p>States is the major enemy of the Palestinian cause and </p><p>the Arab Nation." </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
