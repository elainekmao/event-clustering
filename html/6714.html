<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001913 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB, EB/IFD/OMA/TRA, EUR/SE, </p><p>ROME FOR FAA, PARIS FOR TSA, </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, EAIR, ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: THY PRIVATIZATION:  ON TRACK...FOR NOW </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1203 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Turkish Airlines (THY - Turk Hava </p><p>Yollari) is scheduled for tender in the third quarter 2003, </p><p>and the GOT official heading THY privatization said that </p><p>plans are on schedule.  THY has managed, largely through </p><p>timely sales of old planes, to remain profitable in bad times </p><p>generally for the airline industry.  However, THY officials </p><p>have commented to us privately that, following a profitable </p><p>2002, sales are expected to drop in 2003.  They add that a </p><p>successful privatization this year will be difficult. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Plans on Schedule </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Ali Guner Tekin, the Privatization Administration </p><p>(PA) official in charge of the THY sale, told us March 7 that </p><p>the lead-up to war was hurting THY\'s revenue stream and may </p><p>cause problems for the scheduled privatization process.  "If </p><p>it is a long war, it will affect this privatization </p><p>strongly," Tekin said.  He feels, however, that the Iraq </p><p>conflict will likely be short and cause minimal, if any, </p><p>delays. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In the next few months, Tekin plans to hire a </p><p>consultant to assess the current investor climate, set up a </p><p>value assessment committee, and establish a tender commission </p><p>(chaired by THY\'s Vice President).  The tender commission </p><p>will be responsible for advertising the technical </p><p>specifications of THY aircraft and aircraft parts.  In the </p><p>third quarter of 2003, the PA will give a public offering for </p><p>15-25 percent of the company followed by a block sale of a </p><p>minimum 51 percent, and another public offering for the </p><p>remainder of the company.  Tekin hopes to finalize the sale </p><p>by early 2004.  Press sources estimate THY\'s value in 2001 </p><p>was USD $2-3 billion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Bidders will have to meet a number of requirements: </p><p>no more than 40 percent of THY can be foreign owned; a </p><p>majority of the company\'s capital assets must be held in </p><p>Turkey; and a majority of its board must be Turkish. PA is </p><p>trying to find interested investors in Turkey as well as in </p><p>Turkish expat communities in Europe.  The articles dictate </p><p>that the GOT hold at least one share - the "golden share" - </p><p>reserving the GOT the right to block any future merger </p><p>decisions taken by the new THY management.  Speaking of all </p><p>the conditions that need to be met, Tekin said the right </p><p>bidder will not necessarily be the highest bidder.  "We\'re </p><p>looking for a suitable candidate for our daughter," he said. </p><p>"It doesn\'t have to be rich but it sure needs to be decent." </p><p>. </p><p>THY Remains Profitable in a Struggling Industry </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Taken into the privatization portfolio in August </p><p>1990, THY has undergone two previous iterations of </p><p>privatization efforts gone awry.  In 1991, privatization was </p><p>halted when war with Iraq broke out and, in early 2001, plans </p><p>were again delayed due to the GOT financial crisis. </p><p>Following that crisis, the GOT loosened price and regulatory </p><p>controls on THY flights, allowing it to reduce or eliminate </p><p>unprofitable flight routes, lay off 1,500 workers, sell </p><p>excess aircraft, and pare down in-flight meals.  In addition, </p><p>THY was fortunate to receive $20 million from the Government </p><p>of Iran for the sale of several Airbuses one week prior to </p><p>September 11, 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) This increased autonomy and revenue helped THY </p><p>manage the post 9/11 storm that hit the aviation industry. </p><p>In 2002, a year in which many airlines struggled and two </p><p>European flag carriers went bankrupt, THY had it\'s most </p><p>profitable year since 1996 ($107 million in profits).  In </p><p>2001, THY sales were $1.4 billion; in only the first nine </p><p>months of 2002, sales were $1.2 billion.  (Because THY is the </p><p>largest foreign currency earner in the Turkish economy, it\'s </p><p>revenues are an important mechanism in protecting the Turkish </p><p>lira from depreciation.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Threat of War Hurting Sales </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>7.  (SBU) Head of Marketing for Turkish Airlines Guliz Ozturk </p><p>told us in late February that THY expected a significant </p><p>decrease in international and domestic operations in the </p><p>event of a war in Iraq (reftel).  Ozturk said THY has already </p><p>cut back on its flights to the Far East, and she anticipated </p><p>a significant drop in bookings on THY\'s European flights.  In </p><p>addition, Ozturk said THY was also concerned about its </p><p>domestic operations to eastern and southeastern Turkey, </p><p>noting that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to keep </p><p>aircraft and crews in these cities once an operation began. </p><p>8.  (SBU) COMMENT:  In light of these difficulties, one THY </p><p>executive was doubtful that the airline could be successfully </p><p>privatized this year.  Although Tekin appears to be genuinely </p><p>committed to completing the sale of THY by early 2004, he may </p><p>be overly optimistic on the timing. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
