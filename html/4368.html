<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 006735 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, LE, SY, IR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON POSSIBLE RESCHEDULING OF HIZBALLAH </p><p>RESUPPLY FLIGHT DELIVERED </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 229647 (B) AMMAN 6610 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Following receipt of ref A demarche request, poloff </p><p>conveyed points to Ali al-Ayed, personal assistant to FonMin </p><p>Muasher.  Al-Ayed took down the information and promised to </p><p>share it with the relevant GOJ authorities.  He noted, </p><p>however, that after our last demarche on the subject (ref B), </p><p>he had discussed the overflight issue with FonMin Muasher and </p><p>Muasher had reaffirmed Jordan\'s long-standing position on </p><p>this issue: i.e. that for "technical reasons" (that the </p><p>Iranian overflights cross Jordanian airspace for only 3-5 </p><p>minutes), others in the flight path -- especially the Saudis </p><p>-- are in a better position to intervene effectively than </p><p>Jordan.  That said, Al-Ayed promised that the GOJ would </p><p>continue to monitor the situation closely and would notify </p><p>the Embassy of any Iranian overflight requests they receive. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
