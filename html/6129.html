(U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright, for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company\'s (ADNOC) Deputy </p><p>CEO, Abdullah Bin Nasser Al-Suwaidi does not believe that </p><p>the oil market would collapse following a military conflict </p><p>with Iraq and removal of Saddam Hussein from power.  In a </p><p>March 3 meeting with Econchief and Econoff, Al-Suwaidi </p><p>posited that oil prices would likely soften a bit -- to the </p><p>$18-20 range -- if Iraq produced at full capacity, but would </p><p>not drop significantly beyond that.  (Note: Others in the </p><p>UAE government, including senior officials at the mammoth </p><p>Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which makes the Emirates </p><p>overseas portfolio investments, have privately expressed a </p><p>concern that a drastic drop in oil prices is inevitable, </p><p>down to possibly $8 a barrel.)  Al-Suwaidi elaborated that </p><p>prices are artificially high right now, and that he recently </p><p>signed contracts for the next two months fixing the UAE\'s </p><p>signature \'Murban\' crude at $34 per barrel. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Al-Suwaidi does not believe that Iraq\'s oil </p><p>production will increase substantially in the short term, </p><p>and -- although cheap to produce -- Iraqi oil fields will </p><p>require billions of dollars in investment and several years </p><p>to realize their full potential.  He intimated that the </p><p>Kirkuk and Basra fields, in particular, are in poor </p><p>condition, having been producing for decades.  He also </p><p>suggested that Iraq\'s claimed reserves may be overstated; in </p><p>any case, he doubted that there are any large, undiscovered </p><p>deposits of oil in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
