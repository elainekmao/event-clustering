THE RESCHEDULED UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00895  01 OF 03  221143Z </p><p>ORGANIZATION (FA0) WORLD FOOD SUMMIT FIVE YEARS LATER </p><p>(WFS5YL) WILL MEET JUNE 10-13 IN ROME.  THE FAO COMMITTEE </p><p>ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY (MEETING IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE </p><p>WFS5YL) WILL NEGOTIATE THE WFS5YL DECLARATION.  THE </p><p>DECLARATION IS  CURRENTLY A PATCHWORK OF REGIONAL AND G- </p><p>77 WISH-LISTS AND WILL REQUIRE MUCH WORK IF IT IS TO </p><p>ACTUALLY ADVANCE THE ORIGINAL WORLD FOOD SUMMIT PLAN OF </p><p>ACTION.  THE U.S. IS LIKELY TO BE ISOLATED IN OPPOSING </p><p>DECLARATION LANGUAGE SUPPORTING AN FAO "CODE OF CONDUCT </p><p>ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD"  WHICH MANY COUNTRIES SEE AS A </p><p>MORAL IMPERATIVE AND A SUMMIT "DELIVERABLE."  FAO </p><p>REGIONAL CONFERENCES ARE ALSO MEETING PRIOR TO THE WFS5YL </p><p>AND THE FAO DIRECTOR GENERAL SEEKS FROM THEM SUPPORT FOR </p><p>HIS PROPOSAL FOR A "GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST HUNGER;" BUT </p><p>THE CONFERENCES ARE MORE LIKELY TO FOCUS ON REGIONAL </p><p>ISSUES SUCH AS NEPAD, HIV/AIDS AND TSE TSE FLY </p><p>ERADICATION (AFRICA) AND TRADE LIBERALIZATION (LATIN </p><p>AMERICA).  PLENARY STATEMENTS, ROUNDTABLES, NGO </p><p>MULTISTAKEHOLDER DIALOGUES, PARLIAMENTARIANS MEETINGS AND </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL PANELS DURING THE WFS5YL WILL PROVIDE AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR THE U.S. TO HIGHLIGHT POSITIONS ON </p><p>POVERTY ALLEVIATION, BIOTECH, FOOD AID AND AGRICULTURAL </p><p>TRADE ISSUES.  USG SUPPORT FOR RECENT FAO REQUESTS FOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN BIOTECH WOULD PROVIDE A GOOD ENTRY POINT </p><p>FOR ILLUSTRATING HOW THE U.S. SUPPORTS INITIATIVES TO </p><p>IMPROVE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN REGIONS SUCH AS </p><p>AFRICA THROUGH BIOTECHNOLOGY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>WFS5YL LEAD UP </p><p>------------- </p><p>2.

THE NORTH AMERICAN REGION (U.S. </p><p>AND CANADA) DOES NOT HAVE A REGIONAL CONFERENCE; THE U.S. </p><p>PARTICIPATES AS A MEMBER OF THE ASIA AND PACIFIC </p><p>CONFERENCE AND AS AN OBSERVER AT THE OTHER CONFERENCES. </p><p>FODAG AND/OR USDA WILL ATTEND THE AFRICA CONFERENCE, THE </p><p>ASIA CONFERENCE, THE LATIN AMERICAN CONFERENCE AND THE </p><p>EUROPEAN CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>-- JUNE 6-8 SESSION OF THE FAO\'S COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD </p><p>SECURITY (CFS), THE BODY CHARGED WITH WFS FOLLOW-UP. </p><p>THE CFS DATES WERE CHANGED TO ALLOW IT TO SERVE AS THE </p><p>"PREPCOM" FOR THE WFS5YL. </p><p> </p><p>REGIONAL CONFERENCES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>3.  THE REPORTS OF THE REGIONAL CONFERENCES (NORMALLY </p><p>SUBMITTED TO THE FAO COUNCIL) WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR </p><p>INFORMATION TO THE WFS5YL.  IF THE RECENTLY-CONCLUDED </p><p>AFRICAN REGIONAL CONFERENCE (REFTEL A) IS ANY GUIDE, </p><p>DELEGATES AT THOSE CONFERENCES WILL HIGHLIGHT AREAS OF </p><p>PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE FOOD SECURITY OF THE REGION. </p><p>(AFRICAN CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS HIGHLIGHTED NEPAD, TSE </p><p>TSE FLY ERADICATION AND HIV/AIDS.)

SHE ADMITTED THAT, ABSENT AN AGENDA </p><p>ITEM OR DOCUMENTATION ON THE ISSUE AT THE REGIONAL </p><p>CONFERENCES, SUCH "CONCEPTUALIZATION" MIGHT BE THIN. </p><p>(COMMENT: THE DG URGED SUPPORT FOR THE COALITION IN HIS </p><p>STATEMENT TO THE AFRICAN CONFERENCE, BUT PARTICIPANTS </p><p>THEMSELVES DID NOT MENTION IT.  END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY (CFS) JUNE 6-8 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>4. THE MOST IMPORTANT ITEM FOR THE CFS WILL BE </p><p>NEGOTIATION AND CONCLUSION OF THE WFS5YL DECLARATION, </p><p>MOST LIKELY IN AN OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP (OEWG).  THE </p><p>DOCUMENT, AS IT EMERGED FROM THE 199TH COUNCIL SESSION </p><p>OEWG, IS REPLETE WITH BRACKETS AND INCLUDES TEXT WHICH, </p><p>AS A RESULT OF TIME CONSTRAINTS, NEVER EVEN HAD A FIRST </p><p>READING BY THE OEWG.

OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THE USG ARE: </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00895  02 OF 03  221143Z </p><p> </p><p>- UNDISCUSSED TEXT PROPOSING A CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE </p><p>RIGHT TO FOOD; </p><p>- TEXT IN BRACKETS WHICH GOES FURTHER ON "THE RIGHT TO </p><p>FOOD" THAN THE U.S. WAS ABLE TO ACCEPT AT THE WORLD FOOD </p><p>SUMMIT; </p><p>- LANGUAGE ON FOOD SAFETY WHICH COULD UNDERMINE THE PRE- </p><p>EMINENCE OF CODEX ALIMENTARIUS IN ESTABLISHING FOOD </p><p>SAFETY STANDARDS; </p><p>- TEXT IN BRACKETS ON THE UPCOMING TRADE ROUND ENDORSING </p><p>SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR AGRICULTURE IN DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES; </p><p>- LACK OF ADEQUATE LANGUAGE ON CREATING ENABLING </p><p>ENVIRONMENTS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH; </p><p>- LANGUAGE ON HUNGER WHICH UNDERMINES THE MILLENIUM </p><p>SUMMIT POVERTY REDUCTION LANGUAGE. </p><p> </p><p>RIGHT TO FOOD </p><p>-------------- </p><p>6.  AS DISCUSSED IN REFTEL D, THE PROPOSED CODE OF </p><p>CONDUCT ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD REDIRECTS THE FOCUS OF FOOD </p><p>SECURITY AWAY FROM NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ADVANCES </p><p>THE ARGUMENT THAT INTERNATIONAL ACTORS AND THE PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR HAVE SPECIFIC LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES IN PROMOTING </p><p>AND PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO FOOD.  THE U.S. WILL BE </p><p>CHALLENGED TO SHAPE THE RIGHT TO FOOD DEBATE IN A </p><p>POSITIVE WAY DURING THE WFS5YL IN THE FACE OF WIDESPREAD </p><p>NGO SUPPORT AND A COALITION OF COUNTRIES (PRIMARILY </p><p>LATIN, BUT ALSO NORWAY AND ITALY) WHO SEE RIGHT TO FOOD </p><p>AS A MORAL IMPERATIVE AND A SUMMIT "DELIVERABLE." </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00895  02 OF 03  221143Z </p><p>OTHER CFS ITEMS </p><p>----------------- </p><p>7.  THE CFS WILL ALSO REVIEW RESPONSES FROM COUNTRIES ON </p><p>COMMITMENTS 3,4,6 AND RELEVANT PARTS OF 7 OF THE WORLD </p><p>FOOD SUMMIT (WFS) PROGRAM OF ACTION.  (THESE COMMENTS, -- </p><p>INCLUDING FROM THE UNITED STATES (REFTEL C) -- WERE DUE </p><p>JANUARY 31.) (COMMENT: CFS EFFECTIVENESS IN FOLLOWING UP </p><p>THE WFS COMMITMENTS HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY THE POOR </p><p>RESPONSE FROM COUNTRIES, AND FAO SENIOR MANAGEMENT DOES </p><p>NOT HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR AN IMPROVED RESPONSE RATE AT THE </p><p>UPCOMING SESSION. END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>LEVEL OF ATTENDANCE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>8.  IT IS TOO EARLY TO GIVE AN ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED </p><p>ATTENDANCE BY HEADS OF STATE.  WE HAVE HEARD HEADS OF </p><p>STATE OF URUGUAY AND COLOMBIA MAY ATTEND.  ARGENTINA, </p><p>CHILE, BRAZIL AND PERU ARE NOT EXPECTED TO SEND HEADS OF </p><p>STATE. AFRICA IS EXPECTED TO BE WELL REPRESENTED.  OECD </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES IN ROME DO NOT HAVE A GOOD IDEA ABOUT </p><p>OECD REPRESENTATION, ALTHOUGH WE UNDERSTAND THAT SPANISH </p><p>PRESIDENT AZNAR MAY ATTEND (SPAIN WILL BE HEADING THE </p><p>EU).  BRIEF APPEARANCES BY THE ITALIAN PRESIDENT AND </p><p>PRIME MINISTER ARE EXPECTED. </p><p> </p><p>WFS5YL SIDE EVENTS </p><p>------------------- </p><p>9. THREE WFS5YL ROUNDTABLES ARE SCHEDULED.  EACH COUNTRY </p><p>IS INVITED TO ATTEND ONE ROUNDTABLE (ALL ROUNDTABLES WILL </p><p>DISCUSS THE SAME CFS-ENDORSED TOPIC: "WFS PLAN OF ACTION </p><p>-- RESULTS ACHIEVED, OBSTACLES MET, AND MEANS OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00895  02 OF 03  221143Z </p><p>OVERCOMING THEM"). AN NGO MULTISTAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE WILL </p><p>TAKE PLACE DURING THE WEEK.  A HIGH-LEVEL PANEL WITH </p><p>INVITED GUESTS ON "POLITICAL WILL" (POSTPONED SINCE FALL </p><p>2001) IS EXPECTED TO BE SCHEDULED DURING THE SESSION. THE </p><p>ITALIAN HOSTS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO ORGANIZE A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>NGO ARRANGEMENTS </p><p>----------------- </p><p>10.  WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT SECURITY AND ACCREDITATION </p><p>PROCEDURES WILL NEED TO BE MUCH TIGHTER THAN DURING THE </p><p>FIRST WFS, FAO ORGANIZERS APPEAR RELATIVELY RELAXED ABOUT </p><p>THE UPCOMING EVENT (PARTLY AS A RESULT OF HAVING </p><p>ESSENTIALLY GONE THROUGH A DRY RUN IN 2001).  THEY ARE </p><p>NEGOTIATING PLACEMENT OF AN NGO FORUM IN A SITE A 15 </p><p>MINUTE WALK FROM FAO (THE FORMER ROME CITY ABATTOIR) AND </p><p>HAVE REITERATED THAT THE NGO\'S COMING TO THE WFS5YL ARE </p><p>"NOT ANTI-FAO" (IN CONTRAST TO THE 2001 GENOA G-8 SUMMIT </p><p>WHICH MANY NGO DEMONSTRATORS HOPED TO CLOSE DOWN). </p><p>(COMMENT:  WE EXPECT ANTI-GMO PROTESTORS TO BE OUT IN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5763 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00895  03 OF 03  221143Z </p><p>ACTION SSO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   ANHR-00  E-00     TEDE-00  IO-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   SS-00    TEST-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------6A5A1E  221143Z /38 </p><p>R 221113Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 2350 </p><p>INFO USDA FAS WASHDC 2018 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 000895 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/LYNN REICH AND DICK HUGHES </p><p>STATE FOR E STAFF, IO/EDA ROSE BERSTEIN </p><p>USAID FOR RALPH CUMMINGS AND ROB BERTRAM </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, FAO, EAID, AGR </p><p>SUBJECT:  WORLD FOOD SUMMIT FIVE YEARS LATER STATE OF </p><p>PLAY </p><p> </p><p>FORCE.

U.S. PLENARY INTERVENTIONS AND PARTICIPATION IN SIDE </p><p>EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS (SUCH AS PRESS CONFERENCES) </p><p>PROVIDE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ARTICULATE U.S. POSITIONS </p><p>ON POVERTY ALLEVIATION, THE IMPORTANCE OF BIOTECH FOR </p><p>IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES, THE UPCOMING AGRICULTURAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS, </p><p>AND USE OF FOOD AID. WE EXPECT THAT MEDIA INTEREST WILL </p><p>BE HIGH, AND USDELS (INCLUDING NGO AND CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>DELEGATES) SHOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT </p><p>WITH ITALIAN AUDIENCES (AND MEDIA) ON BIOTECH AND OTHER </p><p>TOPICS OF BILATERAL AS WELL AS MULTILATERAL INTEREST.  IN </p><p>THIS REGARD, WE WOULD HOPE THAT RECENT FAO REQUESTS FOR </p><p>U.S. SUPPORT FOR A BIOTECH NETWORK IN AFRICA, AND FOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN DEVELOPING A BIOTECH IPR STRATEGY (REFTEL </p><p>E) MIGHT BE GIVEN A FAVORABLE RECEPTION BY INTERESTED USG </p><p>AGENCIES.
