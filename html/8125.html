Summary: The Consular Section received the visa </p><p>    application of an individual presenting a Brazilian passport </p><p>    and stating he also held the passports of Libya, Egypt and </p><p>    Turkey. Individual intended to travel as part of an official </p><p>    UAE delegation to the United States. After contacting the Fraud </p><p>    Unit at the US Consulate General in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the </p><p>    Brazilian passport was found to be fraudulent.  In addition, a </p><p>    Local Lookout entered by Post in November 2001 from a </p><p>    Diplomatic Note circulated by the UAE Embassy in Baghdad, </p><p>    showed that the same individual had lost a UAE diplomatic </p><p>    passport issued in his name. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.   On 10 May 2003, the Consular Section received the visa </p><p>    application of TATANAKI, Hassan Salah El Din, DPOB, 04 Jan </p><p>    1957, Libya. The individual presented a Brazilian passport </p><p>    issued in Sao Paulo in November 2002.  The Fraud Unit in Sao </p><p>    Paulo confirmed with the Federal Police that although they had </p><p>    a record of a passport issued with the above bio data, the </p><p>    photo in their files did not match the one in the passport or </p><p>    visa application.  Furthermore, conoffs in Ankara confirmed </p><p>    with Turkish Passport authorities that there is no record of a </p><p>    Turkish passport issued to the above individual. </p><p> </p><p>3.   A local check of NIV records showed a Local Lookout for </p><p>    the above individual.  The Lookout file indicated that the UAE </p><p>    Embassy in Baghdad had sent a series of diplomatic notes on </p><p>    October 2, 2001, reporting that a total of 13 UAE diplomatic </p><p>    passports had been lost, one of which belonged to a TATARIAKI, </p><p>    Hassan Salah Aldeen. Checks with consular contacts at UAE </p><p>    Immigration confirmed that this is the same individual. </p><p> </p><p>4.   A check of the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) showed </p><p>    that the individual\'s brother TATANAKI, Faez Salah El Din, </p><p>    DPOB, 12 May 1954, Libya, had presented a fraudulent Brazilian </p><p>    passport in London in February 1999 and had been refused for </p><p>    misrepresentation and fraud, INA 212(a)(6)(C).  In addition, in </p><p>    February 2002, the same brother had a visa in a Turkish </p><p>    passport revoked under INA 212(a)(3)(A)(i) by conoffs in Cairo. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Comment:  The case of Hassan Tatanaki illustrates the </p><p>    continuing problems associated with the issuance UAE passports </p><p>    to non-UAE nationals.  As reported in previous cables (see </p><p>    refs), the basis for issuance of a UAE passport to an </p><p>    individual may only be the individual\'s connection to </p><p>    influential ruling family members.  In this particular case, </p><p>    the individual also held passports from four other countries, </p><p>    at least one of which was fraudulent. The individual has been </p><p>    entered into CLASS under section 212(a)(6)(C) of the INA. End </p><p>    Comment. </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
