<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 KABUL 001215 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR ZKHALILZAD, JDWORKEN, RHANSON; DSEDNEY </p><p>STATE FOR SA/PAB, SA/AR AMBASSADOR JOHNSON, PAT </p><p>HASLACH </p><p>AID FOR ANATSIOS, JKUNDER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, SOCI, AF, SNAR </p><p>SUBJECT: Second update on USG support for the </p><p>Justice Commission </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Kabul 639 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: The Commission for Reform of Justice </p><p>and the Judiciary (CRJJ) continues to make </p><p>strides in implementing elements of its Master </p><p>Plan, which includes 29 reform tasks and a rough </p><p>budget and timeline.  The entire Plan has not </p><p>been officially approved, which impedes needed </p><p>upgrades in donor coordination and commitments. </p><p>Nonetheless, the Commission?s selection and </p><p>initial implementation of priority actions should </p><p>elicit optimism over the possibility of reform </p><p>occurring in the justice sector.  The USG has </p><p>been the primary donor, to date; though, the </p><p>Italians are designated to be the lead </p><p>coordinating country.  Through USAID, STATE/INL </p><p>and CJCMOTF, the USG will continue to support the </p><p>Commission and will help the CRJJ initiate four </p><p>out of the five high priority activities that it </p><p>has selected from its Master Plan.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Establishment of the Work Plan </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  USAID, through contracts with Bearing Point </p><p>and Management Systems International (MSI) and a </p><p>subcontract with the Asia Foundation (TAF), has </p><p>been providing assistance to the Judicial </p><p>Commission, since its inception.  Technical </p><p>assistance helped the Commission for Reform of </p><p>Justice and the Judiciary (CRJJ) establish a </p><p>Master Plan and initialize the implementation of </p><p>elements of the Plan.  The Plan comports with </p><p>both mandates from the Bonn Accords and </p><p>Presidential Decree #153 that direct the CRJJ to </p><p>operate in the following four areas:  1) Law </p><p>Reform; 2) Surveys, Physical Infrastructure, and </p><p>Training; 3) Legal Education and Awareness; 4) </p><p>Structure of Judicial Institutions. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>CRJJ Progress with USG Assistance </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The USG, through OTI and CJCMOTF, has </p><p>assisted the CRJJ with extensive reconstruction </p><p>of the judicial infrastructure and equipment. </p><p> For example, OTI funded the Kabul Public Court </p><p>House.  Currently, the USG is also contributing </p><p>to four of the five priority areas of the Work </p><p>Plan selected by the CRJJ for immediate </p><p>implementation.  For each priority area, the CRJJ </p><p>will establish a working group.  The CRJJ has </p><p>already selected appropriate lead and cooperating </p><p>Ministries, as well as participating legal </p><p>entities, organizations and actors.  USAID will </p><p>provide technical advisors for four of these </p><p>priority areas to help facilitate cooperation </p><p>among the working group, budget development and </p><p>other organizational needs.  USAID advisors will </p><p>also provide substantive technical advice that </p><p>includes methods for research and implementation </p><p>of the reforms.  It remain  unclear how </p><p>successful this cooperation will be between </p><p>entities, particularly among other Ministries </p><p>that may resist elements of the reform tasks. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Summary of the four USG support areas </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   Advisor to the Chairman of the CRJJ:  The </p><p>CRJJ faces many challenges and multiple tasks. </p><p>It is charged with rebuilding the domestic </p><p>justice system, which includes assessing the </p><p>current state of the system, researching and </p><p>proposing reforms and, in cooperation with UNAMA </p><p>and the Italians, enlisting and coordinating the </p><p>necessary technical and donor support.   USAID, </p><p>through the TAF and MSI, will provide a technical </p><p>advisor to support the CRJJ?s efforts in law </p><p>reform and compilation, to organize a process for </p><p>public input into decision for reform, to revise </p><p>laws and to analyze need for reform the court </p><p>systems.  The advisor will also provide </p><p>administration support to the Commission and </p><p>design approaches to training. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Property Deed Rehabilitation:  Property deed </p><p>rehabilitation is considered an urgent issue to </p><p>secure mortgages in urban areas and title for </p><p>collateral in rural areas.  The Ministry of </p><p>Finance is charged with the issue and may provide </p><p>some funding from the ARTF.  USAID will manage </p><p>the process by providing technical assistance on </p><p>deed registry systems with the aim of proposing </p><p>appropriate reforms.   The technical advisor will </p><p>work with a CRJJ working group to make decisions </p><p>about the appropriate technology, draft proposed </p><p>amendments on the law for recording deed and </p><p>other laws related to land tenure.  USAID will </p><p>also provide infrastructural support for the </p><p>rehabilitation of the property deed registry at </p><p>the Kabul court, attempt to preserve property </p><p>deeds and modernize the property deed recording </p><p>office.   This work will build upon current </p><p>USAID/OTI-funded emergency assistance in </p><p>preserving the property deeds presently found in </p><p>two locations. </p><p> </p><p>6. Prototype Legal Facility for the district </p><p>level:  The physical infrastructure of courts is </p><p>a fundamental componento thelong-term plan for </p><p>judicial rehabilitation. The CRJJ plans to have </p><p>designed a government complex which would </p><p>encompass the district court facilities.  The </p><p>Ministry of Urban Development will coordinate the </p><p>design process.  STATE/INL will fund the </p><p>construction, contributing $200,000 to $250,000. </p><p>With USAID support, MSI will hire an architect to </p><p>develop an optimal design for a district </p><p>courthouse that would accommodate all appropriate </p><p>functions for such a facility.  The legal </p><p>facility is designed to become a demonstration </p><p>model and develop information regarding the costs </p><p>of such a facility.  The building will include </p><p>space for the public to watch the proceedings, </p><p>for staff to work and possibly reside, a law </p><p>library with public access, detention facilities </p><p>for criminal suspects, legal aid and a bar </p><p>association.  The prototype will also include an </p><p>incinerator for narcotics, a place for evidence </p><p>storage and a center for prosecutorial training. </p><p>Currently, CJCMOTF is considering assisting in </p><p>the construction of district level legal </p><p>facilities.  This design will provide a good base </p><p>model for that construction. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Public Education Advisor:   Public awareness </p><p>of the formal law in Afghanistan is minimal. </p><p>Legal literacy is needed to inform the public, </p><p>strengthening democracy and enhance access to </p><p>justice.  USAID is expected to provide at least </p><p>one technical advisor to CRJJ to assist the </p><p>public education process around reforms in the </p><p>justice sector.  The technical advisor will also </p><p>work with the CRJJ to coordinate with the </p><p>Constitutional Commission on publicity related to </p><p>the new constitution after its adoption.  The </p><p>public education program may include legal </p><p>seminars, workshops and round-tables for the </p><p>public; radio programs on legal rights and </p><p>advertisements in the print media. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Possible future USG assistance to the CRJJ </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. Planning for support for the CRJJ has </p><p>proceeded in two additional areas.  INL, through </p><p>TAF, plans to provide support for a one-year </p><p>program in prosecutorial training.  Training </p><p>prosecutors would inaugurate CRJJ plans to </p><p>require training and examinations and pay scales </p><p>for the justice sector and tie personnel for </p><p>promotion and increases in salary to an </p><p>examination process.   A second area currently </p><p>under planning is USAID?s supported reform in </p><p>public administration.  Following the </p><p>ratification of the Constitution, the </p><p>organization of the state and building </p><p>transparency and accountability into this </p><p>organization will be a pressing priority. </p><p>However, the law reform demanded by reform in </p><p>public administration is a politically sensitive </p><p>area, which involves reform that reaches beyond </p><p>the specter of judicial and criminal reform. </p><p>Consequently, public administration is burdened </p><p>with political uncertainty and apprehension that </p><p>hinders the pace and the uniformity of its </p><p>implementation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>CRJJ assistance from other government donors </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. The Italians have adopted the lead on </p><p>performing a survey on the institutional status </p><p>of the Justice Sector across Afghanistan, as well </p><p>as an evaluation of the existing informal </p><p>systems.  Initial development of this survey was </p><p>executed by USAID-funded technical assistance </p><p>through the TAF, in cooperation with CJCMOTF. </p><p>The survey of Kabul is complete and USAID has </p><p>been informed by the Italians that the survey </p><p>process has begun in 5 other regions.  It is </p><p>unclear when the Italians will complete the </p><p>project. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Concerns on progress of the Justice Commission </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>10. Three issues related to the work of the CRJJ </p><p>should be monitored.  First, the CRJJ needs to </p><p>officially approve the Master Plan and release </p><p>it, in order to elicit greater donor commitments. </p><p> Second, it is important to note that many of the </p><p>first approved projects focus more on the form of </p><p>the system and less on the substance of law </p><p>reform.  The political sensitivity around </p><p>extensive law reform often slows or stalls its </p><p>implementation in transitioning countries. </p><p>Third, coordination between the Constitutional </p><p>Commission and the Judicial Commission appears to </p><p>be strained, as indicated by the Constitutional </p><p>Commission?s unwillingness to share a copy of the </p><p>draft Constitution with the Justice Commission. </p><p>Problems in coordination will hinder the ability </p><p>of the Justice Commission to do some of the work </p><p>mandated by Bonn, such as the creation of a draft </p><p>law on the constitutional curt and the law on </p><p>justice administration. </p><p> </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
