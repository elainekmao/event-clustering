(C) SUMMARY: ON THE EVE OF THE JUNE 24-25 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, THIS CABLE OFFERS POST\'S </p><p>PREDICTIONS FOR HOTSPOTS AND TOUGH RACES AMONG </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES IN ZIMBABWE\'S TEN PROVINCES. THE MDC IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO FARE VERY WELL IN MOST PROVINCES, WITH ITS </p><p>TOUGHEST CHALLENGE COMING FROM THE TRADITIONAL ZANU-PF </p><p>STRONGHOLDS OF THE "THREE MASHONALANDS" (MASHONALAND </p><p>CENTRAL, EAST, AND WEST), AND MASVINGO. POST PREDICTS A </p><p>WIN OF ABOUT 60 SEATS FOR THE MDC, ALTHOUGH OPPOSITION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03460  01 OF 07  231346Z </p><p>LEADERS HAVE TOLD US THEY EXPECT TO WALK AWAY WITH 80-85 </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES. LIKELY VOTE RIGGING CLEARLY WOULD AFFECT </p><p>THOSE NUMBERS. WHILE WE EXPECT THE ELECTION WEEKEND TO </p><p>BE REASONABLY QUIET, THE POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE WILL </p><p>INCREASE GREATLY IN THE JUNE 26-28 PERIOD, AS RESULTS </p><p>FROM EACH CONSTITUENCY ARE ANNOUNCED. IN THE RURAL </p><p>AREAS, MUGABE ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL GIVE WAR VETERANS </p><p>THE GREEN LIGHT TO SEEK REVENGE AGAINST COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS, THEIR EMPLOYEES, AND COMMUNAL RESIDENTS SHOULD </p><p>THE RURAL VOTE NOT GO ZANU-PF\'S WAY. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>VIOLENCE DURING ELECTIONS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ALTHOUGH THE POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE IN THE CITIES </p><p>AND ON OCCUPIED FARMS AFTER THE ELECTIONS IS HIGH, POST </p><p>EXPECTS JUNE 24 AND 25 TO BE REASONABLY QUIET DAYS AT </p><p>THE POLLS, WITH ONLY ISOLATED SKIRMISHES BETWEEN RIVAL </p><p>PARTIES OCCURRING IN SOME HOTSPOTS. THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>REPUBLIC POLICE INTENDS TO DEPLOY 30,000 OFFICERS TO THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S 4,000 POLLING STATIONS OVER THE VOTING </p><p>WEEKEND, AND ARMED MILITARY PERSONNEL ALSO ARE EXPECTED </p><p>TO BE VISIBLE. DESPITE SUCH DETERRENTS, SEVERAL HOTSPOTS </p><p>COULD SEE OUTBREAKS OF FIGHTING, PARTICULARLY IN THE </p><p>HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBS AND OCCUPIED FARMING AREAS. </p><p>FOLLOWING ARE SOME CONSTITUENCIES WHERE VIOLENCE IS MORE </p><p>LIKELY TO OCCUR: </p><p> </p><p>-- BUDIRIRO, HARARE PROVINCE: A HIGH-DENSITY SUBURB AND </p><p>HOME TO WAR VETERANS\' LEADER CHENJERAI "HITLER" HUNZVI\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03460  01 OF 07  231346Z </p><p>MEDICAL OFFICES, WHERE MDC SUPPORTERS ALLEGEDLY HAVE </p><p>BEEN TORTURED. </p><p> </p><p>-- CHITUNGWIZA AND HIGHFIELD, HARARE PROVINCE: TWO OF </p><p>THE CAPITAL\'S LARGEST HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBS. </p><p> </p><p>-- PLUMTREE, BULAWAYO PROVINCE: A LARGE PERI-URBAN AREA </p><p>ON THE BOTSWANA BORDER. </p><p> </p><p>-- KWEKWE, MIDLANDS: TERRITORY OF MINISTER OF JUSTICE </p><p>AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, A ZANU-PF </p><p>HARD-LINER WHO HAS FULLY EMBRACED PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S </p><p>CAMPAIGN STRATEGY OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE FOLLOWING AREAS IN MASHONALAND EAST: WEDZA, </p><p>MUTOKO NORTH, MUTOKO SOUTH, MUDZI, MUREHWA NORTH, </p><p>MUREHWA SOUTH, GOROMONZI, AND CHIKOMBA.

THE RACE </p><p>WILL BE CLOSE, BUT IN THE END, WE PREDICT THE MDC </p><p>PROBABLY WILL FALL SHORT OF THE 76. (OF COURSE, IN THE </p><p>CASE OF RAMPANT RIGGING OR BALLOT BOX STUFFING, ALL BETS </p><p>ARE OFF.) THE FOLLOWING IS A BREAKDOWN OF OUR </p><p>PREDICTIONS BY PROVINCE, INCLUDING SOME NOTES ON TOUGH </p><p>RACES IN PARTICULAR CONSTITUENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03460  02 OF 07  231347Z </p><p>4. (C) HARARE (19 SEATS): THE MDC IS EXPECTED TO WIN A </p><p>LARGE MAJORITY OF CONSTITUENCIES WITH VOTES FROM </p><p>WORKERS, UNEMPLOYED YOUTH, THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY (WHITE </p><p>AND BLACK), AND OTHER WELL INFORMED ZIMBABWEANS WHO </p><p>BLAME THE RULING PARTY FOR THE COLLAPSE OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN HARARE NORTH, THOUGH, THE INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE </p><p>CHESTER MHENDE IS FAVORED TO WIN OVER THE ZANU-PF AND </p><p>MDC CANDIDATES. (TRUDY STEVENSON, THE MDC NOMINEE, IS A </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE AND NOT A NATIVE-BORN ZIMBABWEAN; </p><p>SHE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY GARNERING VOTES.) </p><p> </p><p>-- HARARE SOUTH ALSO IS EXPECTED TO BE A TOUGH RACE </p><p>BETWEEN INCUMBENT MARGARET DONGO, PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE UNION OF DEMOCRATS AND CURRENTLY THE ONLY </p><p>INDEPENDENT PARLIAMENTARIAN, ZANU-PF CANDIDATE VIVIAN </p><p>MWASHITA, AND MDC CHALLENGER GABRIEL CHAIBVA. THE </p><p>OUTCOME IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT; DONGO HAS STOOD THE </p><p>TEST OF TIME IN HER CONSTITUENCY, RETAINS SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>POPULARITY, BUT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT MARGINALIZED ON THE </p><p>NATIONAL POLITICAL SCENE. SHE HAS COMPLAINED </p><p>VOCIFEROUSLY, HOWEVER, THAT AS A RESULT OF THE REDRAWING </p><p>OF THE HARARE SOUTH BOUNDARIES BY THE DELIMITATION </p><p>COMMISSION, ABOUT 5,000 SOLDIERS ON A NEARBY MILITARY </p><p>BASE NOW ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE IN HER DISTRICT. DONGO </p><p>IS WORRIED THAT THE MILITARY VOTES (EITHER GENUINE OR </p><p>DOCTORED BY THE RULING PARTY) COULD SWING THE ELECTION </p><p>IN FAVOR OF MWASHITA. THE MDC ALSO IS EXTREMELY POPULAR </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE HARARE CONSTITUENCIES, AND CHAIBVA, WHILE </p><p>NOT WELL KNOWN, CANNOT BE RULED OUT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03460  02 OF 07  231347Z </p><p> </p><p>-- MDC CANDIDATES ARE EXPECTED TO WIN IN THE INFAMOUS </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES OF BUDIRIRO (HOME OF HUNZVI\'S SURGERY), </p><p>AND CHITUNGWIZA (HARARE\'S MOST CROWDED HIGH DENSITY </p><p>SUBURB AND SITE OF FREQUENT VIOLENT CLASHES). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) BULAWAYO (8 SEATS), MATABELELAND NORTH (7 SEATS), </p><p>AND MATABELELAND SOUTH (8 SEATS): THE MDC IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>WIN A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE SEATS IN THESE PROVINCES </p><p>DOMINATED BY THE MARGINALIZED NDEBELE ETHNIC GROUP. THE </p><p>MDC IS FIELDING A LOT OF UNKNOWN CANDIDATES IN THESE </p><p>PROVINCES, THOUGH, AND MANY INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES ALSO </p><p>ARE LOOKING TO SNATCH VOTES FROM THE RULING PARTY. FOR </p><p>THEIR PART, MDC LEADERS ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE NDEBELES </p><p>WILL SUPPORT THEM OVER INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES IN A </p><p>PROTEST VOTE AGAINST THE HUMAN RIGHTS ATROCITIES </p><p>SANCTIONED BY PRESIDENT MUGABE DURING THE MID-1980S. IN </p><p>BOTH BULAWAYO SOUTH AND MAKOBA, HOWEVER, TWO POPULAR </p><p>"INDEPENDENT" NDEBELE CANDIDATES STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF </p><p>BEATING BOTH THE ZANU-PF AND MDC NOMINEES. CHARLES MPOFU </p><p>(BULAWAYO SOUTH -- SEE BELOW) AND MATSON HLALO (MAKOBA - </p><p>- SEE BELOW) ARE FORMER ZANU-PF\'ERS WHO DEFECTED FROM </p><p>THE RULING PARTY AFTER THE 1999 BULAWAYO CITY COUNCIL </p><p>ELECTIONS AND STILL RETAIN SUBSTANTIAL POPULARITY IN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3101 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03460  03 OF 07  231347Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------664ACA  231347Z /38 </p><p>P 231350Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6403 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 07 HARARE 003460 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF PDAS NANCY POWELL, AF DAS WITNEY SCHNEIDMAN, </p><p>AND AF/S - ARLENE RENDER </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/ROBERT SHEPARD </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/RALYEA AND NATAN EPSTEIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03460  03 OF 07  231347Z </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID WASHDC FOR AFR/SA - NAN NEWMAN, OTI - MARC </p><p>SCOTT, AND A/AID - RICHARD MCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/22/2000 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ELAB, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DESPITE STIFF COMPETITION, POTENTIAL FOR </p><p>VIOLENCE IN SOME AREAS, AND EXPECTED VOTE RIGGING, MDC </p><p>LIKELY TO WIN ABOUT 60 SEATS </p><p> </p><p>THEIR AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>-- BULAWAYO SOUTH: THIS WILL BE A VERY DIFFICULT RACE </p><p>BETWEEN INDEPENDENT CHARLES MPOFU AND DAVID COLTART, THE </p><p>MDC SECRETARY FOR LEGAL AFFAIRS AND A PROMINENT ATTORNEY </p><p>AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST. THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE, </p><p>CALLISTUS NDLOVU, IS NOT EXPECTED TO FARE WELL, AS HE IS </p><p>A KNOWN CRITIC OF FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AND NDEBELE </p><p>LEADER JOSHUA NKOMO. </p><p> </p><p>-- MAKOBA: THIS ALSO WILL BE A TOUGH RACE BETWEEN </p><p>INDEPENDENT MATSON HLALO, A WELL-KNOWN NDEBELE </p><p>POLITICIAN, POPULAR ZANU-PF CANDIDATE SITHEMBISO NYONI </p><p>(A MINISTER OF STATE IN THE OFFICE OF THE VICE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03460  03 OF 07  231347Z </p><p>PRESIDENT), AND LITTLE KNOWN MDC CANDIDATE THOKOZANI </p><p>KHUPE. </p><p> </p><p>-- NKULUMANE: A HIGH PROFILE AND DIFFICULT RACE WILL </p><p>TAKE PLACE BETWEEN MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS DUMISO </p><p>DABENGWA (AT ONE TIME A DISAFFECTED ZAPU DETAINEE), AND </p><p>MDC VICE PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA. BOTH ARE NDEBELE, AND </p><p>BOTH ENJOY SUPPORT IN THE CONSTITUENCY. SIBANDA IS </p><p>FAVORED TO WIN, THOUGH, BOTH BECAUSE OF HIS TRADE UNION </p><p>ROOTS AND ASSOCIATION WITH THE MDC, AND BECAUSE OF </p><p>DABENGWA\'S IMAGE AS A LAME DUCK IN MUGABE\'S CABINET WHO </p><p>HAS TURNED HIS BACK ON HIS PEOPLE. IF SIBANDA WINS, IT </p><p>WILL BE A VERY BIG VICTORY FOR THE MDC. </p><p> </p><p>-- BULAWAYO NORTH: FORMER BULAWAYO MAYOR JOSHUA MAHLINGA </p><p>(ALSO AN ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE DISABLED), FACES </p><p>MDC SECRETARY GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE IN WHAT WILL LIKELY </p><p>BE A VERY CLOSE RACE.

(C) MANICALAND (14 SEATS): THE MDC IS EXPECTED TO WIN </p><p>AT LEAST HALF THE SEATS HERE, ALTHOUGH A FEW LIKELY WILL </p><p>BE LOST TO MORE POPULAR INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES.

SOME, </p><p>LIKE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY CHIEF WHIP MOSES MVENGE IN </p><p>MUTARE CENTRAL, LAZARUS NZARAYEBANI IN MUTARE SOUTH, AND </p><p>SHEPHERD MUKWEKWEZEKE IN MUTARE WEST, FORMERLY WERE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03460  03 OF 07  231347Z </p><p>OUTSPOKEN ZANU-PF PARLIAMENTARIANS WHOM THE POLITBURO </p><p>EFFECTIVELY SIDELINED FOR CRITICIZING RULING PARTY </p><p>POLICIES.

MDC NONETHELESS EXPECTS TO </p><p>FARE EXTREMELY WELL IN MANICALAND, PARTLY BECAUSE THOSE </p><p>VOTES THAT THE RULING PARTY DOES RECEIVE ARE LIKELY TO </p><p>BE SPLIT BETWEEN THE NEW "ZANU-PF INDEPENDENTS" AND </p><p>FORMAL RULING PARTY CANDIDATES.

ALTHOUGH THE MDC ASSERTS </p><p>THAT MASHONALAND RESIDENTS ARE KEEPING THEIR LOYALTY TO </p><p>THE PARTY HIDDEN AND WILL VOTE THEIR CONSCIENCE ON </p><p>ELECTION DAY, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT THE STATE-SPONSORED </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL.

THE </p><p>MDC\'S SUPPORT STEMS FIRST AND FOREMOST FROM THE FACT </p><p>THAT IT PROMISES CHANGE, IN PARTICULAR ECONOMIC REFORM, </p><p>AND A NEW, MORE TRANSPARENT, AND MORE INCLUSIVE STYLE OF </p><p>GOVERNANCE.

OF 566 TOTAL CANDIDATES, A STUNNING 40 </p><p>PERCENT (OR 226) REPRESENT VARIOUS INDEPENDENT PARTIES </p><p>OTHER THAN ZANU-PF AND THE MDC.

THE DISPLACED </p><p>POLITICIANS -- MANY OF WHOM STILL ENJOY WIDESPREAD </p><p>SUPPORT IN THEIR AREAS -- THEREFORE ARE RUNNING AS </p><p>INDEPENDENTS, AND ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE AWAY A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF VOTES THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE FOR </p><p>THE RULING PARTY. SOME POPULAR FORMER ZANU-PF\'ERS NOW </p><p>RUNNING AS INDEPENDENTS INCLUDE CHESTER MHENDE IN HARARE </p><p>NORTH, MOSES MVENGE IN MUTARE CENTRAL, VESTER SITHOLE IN </p><p>CHIPINGE NORTH (MANICALAND), LAZARUS NZARAYEBANI IN </p><p>MUTARE SOUTH, SHEPHERD MUKWEKWEZEKE IN MUTARE WEST, AND </p><p>JOHN TSIMBA IN MARONDERA WEST.

(C) IF THERE IS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF VOTE RIGGING, WE </p><p>EXPECT THE MDC TO GARNER ABOUT 60 SEATS -- MORE THAN THE </p><p>ONE-THIRD OF THE LEGISLATURE NECESSARY TO BLOCK </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND APPROPRIATIONS BILLS.

THE </p><p>PRIMARY DETERRENTS TO ELECTION RIGGING WILL BE THE </p><p>DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MONITORS, AS WELL AS THE </p><p>CANDIDATES\' POLLING AGENTS, WHOM ELECTION OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>SUPPOSED TO ALLOW TO REMAIN WITH THE BALLOT BOXES FROM </p><p>THE OPENING OF THE POLLS TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE COUNT. </p><p>ALTHOUGH DIPLOMATS WERE EVENTUALLY ACCREDITED, THE </p><p>ELECTION DIRECTORATE LIMITED THE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS IT WOULD ACCREDIT (INCLUDING DENYING NDI AND </p><p>IRI OBSERVER STATUS). IN THE END, WE EXPECT TO SEE A </p><p>TOTAL OF ABOUT 300 INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS ACTUALLY ON </p><p>THE GROUND. MEANWHILE, THE NUMBER OF DOMESTIC MONITORS </p><p>IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT 16,000, DOWN FROM THE 20,0000 </p><p>ORIGINALLY PLANNED. THESE ACCREDITATION PROBLEMS </p><p>CERTAINLY ARE NO ACCIDENT. WITH THE NUMBER OF WATCHFUL </p><p>EYES ON THE BALLOT BOXES GREATLY REDUCED, IT REMAINS TO </p><p>BE SEEN WHETHER THE RULING PARTY WILL BE ABLE TO TAMPER </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE ELECTION RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
