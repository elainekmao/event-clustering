<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 003416 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, NEA/NGA, PMAT; OSD FOR ISA AND ISP; JCS </p><p>FOR J5; EUCOM FOR J5, POLAD; CENTCOM FOR J5 AND POLAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: THE TURKS AND THE STABILIZATION FORCE IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 2538 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 2553 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The GOT continues to express an interest in </p><p>participating in the stabilization force in Iraq.  The Turks </p><p>understand the political sensitivity of a neighboring state </p><p>putting troops in Iraq.  According to MFA DDG for NATO </p><p>Affairs Sanivar Kizildeli, Turkey is not looking to use NATO </p><p>as a "back door" to get into the force.  Rather, Iraq is such </p><p>a key national interest for Turkey that the GOT wants to </p><p>ensure that a reputable and reliable institution like NATO is </p><p>responsible for Iraq\'s security over the long term.  While </p><p>Turkey initially made missteps initially regarding financial </p><p>aid and the London Conference, there are good reasons for a </p><p>Turkish role in the force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) It appears that the Poles may have generated adequate </p><p>forces for its division for now.  But looking down the road, </p><p>our experience in Afghanistan tells us that few countries </p><p>have the resources or the public support for extended </p><p>operations far from home.  Allowing the Turks the maximum </p><p>possible role now could spare us from encountering Turkish </p><p>recalcitrance later when we are looking for countries to </p><p>contribute troops.  Embassy Ankara advocates this approach </p><p>because it serves US long-term interests in Iraqi transition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Per Ref B, Turkey has offered a gamut of capabilities </p><p>from a division-level headquarters to a humanitarian </p><p>assistance brigade, psyops unit, and air traffic control. </p><p>The USG may best be able to exploit these capabilities </p><p>without unnecessarily offending sensitivities in Iraq by </p><p>accepting non-combat assets such as a medical unit, mobile </p><p>surgical hospital, humanitarian assistance unit, firefighting </p><p>units, air traffic controllers, ground illumination units, </p><p>etc. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We understand that Washington is considering offering </p><p>Turkey some advisor slots for the Polish division.  This type </p><p>of minimal role is a good start, but as we look longer term, </p><p>we should consider a broader role for Turkey in the short- to </p><p>medium-term in order to keep open our options in the future. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
