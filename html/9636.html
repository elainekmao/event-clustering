<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 003368 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/FO, EUR/WE, EUR/ERA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S.-EU TROIKA POLITIAL DIRECTORS - PRODUCTIVE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON ESDP, IRAQ, NON PROLIFERATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM SCOTT KILNER.  REASON:1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  A/S Jones had broad, frank and productive </p><p>discussions at the U.S.-EU Troika Political Directors </p><p>meeting, chaired by Italian MFA POLDIR Giancarlo Aragona in </p><p>Rome on July 18.  Both sides agreed on the need for </p><p>strengthened and complementary U.S.-EU and EU-NATO security </p><p>relations under Berlin plus, and for support of the ESDP </p><p>operation in Macedonia; the US and EU remain open to an EU </p><p>command of SFOR responsibilities in Bosnia, if and when </p><p>conditions merit the transfer from NATO.  Jones stressed that </p><p>Galileo will require a political-level decision, based on </p><p>technical discussions, to successfully resolve the overlay </p><p>problem. The Middle East is a priority for the Italian </p><p>Presidency and the EU praised President Bush\'s personal </p><p>involvement.  A/S Jones noted the President wants the Quartet </p><p>to play a strong role in the MEPP.  She also noted progress </p><p>on resolving remaining differences on the Container Security </p><p>Initiative and the Passenger Name Record programs.   Although </p><p>little headway was made on ICC/article 98, the </p><p>non-confrontational exchange of views allowed both sides to </p><p>clarify their concerns.  Both sides agreed that in Iraq, the </p><p>international community should focus on security issues, </p><p>improvement of quality of life, development of self-governing </p><p>mechanisms, and economic revitalization. The Afghanistan </p><p>government projects a budget shortfall of over 180 million </p><p>USD; the EU is on track to meet its pledge of one billion </p><p>Euros over five years. A/S Jones expressed appreciation for </p><p>the development and launch of the EU Strategy against </p><p>Proliferation of WMD; now we should focus on practical </p><p>measures in Iran and North Korea. Jones argued that the U.S. </p><p>and EU should develop a strategy to use the next IAEA report, </p><p>which will reportedly be very critical of Tehran. Aragona </p><p>said that North Korea\'s WMD program is a multilateral, global </p><p>problem, and needs a joint and coordinated response. He </p><p>expressed hope that China would play a helpful role.  A/S </p><p>Jones urged the EU to use Moscow\'s desire for good relations </p><p>with the West to promote reforms in Russia, and said that the </p><p>US was open to an EU stabilization force in Moldova, under an </p><p>OSCE mandate.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Participants </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) U.S.: Beth Jones, Assistant Secretary European and </p><p>Eurasian Affairs; Chuck English, Director, Office of European </p><p>Union Affairs; Scott Kilner, Econ Counselor, U.S. Embassy </p><p>Rome; Gary Robbins, POL-MIL Counselor, U.S. Embassy Rome; Lee </p><p>Litzenberger, Political Officer, U.S. Mission to the EU; Kent </p><p>Logsdon, Special Assistant to A/S Jones; Marja Verloop, EU </p><p>Desk Officer; and Jim Donegan, Political Officer, U.S. </p><p>Embassy Rome.  Presidency: Giancarlo Aragona, Political </p><p>Director; Sandro De Bernardin, CFSP Coordinator and European </p><p>Correspondent; Gerolamo Schiavoni, Head, North America </p><p>Bureau; and Pierfrancesco Sacco, Deputy European </p><p>Correspondent.  Council Secretariat:  Robert Cooper, Director </p><p>General; Jim Cloos, Director Transatlantic Relations; and </p><p>Massimo Parnisari, European Correspondent.  European </p><p>Commission: Fernando Valenzuela, Deputy Director General for </p><p>External Relations; Percy Westerlund, Director, North </p><p>America; and Peter Dun, Assistant European Correspondent. </p><p>Ireland: David Cooney, Political Director; and Kevin Conmy, </p><p>European Correspondent. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>European Security Strategy (ESS) </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Aragona began by saying he was pleased that the June </p><p>U.S.-EU Summit had set the right tone for progress on the </p><p>European Security Strategy.  The outline Solana presented in </p><p>Thessaloniki would serve as the foundation for further work; </p><p>the goal is to have the document ready to sign by member </p><p>state heads of government at the December EU Summit.  The </p><p>Italian Presidency would do whatever was necessary to ensure </p><p>the document strengthened and complemented US-EU and EU-NATO </p><p>security relations - in other words, that it was completely </p><p>in accordance with Berlin plus.  The Italian Presidency will </p><p>host a Ministerial at 25 on August 29 to discuss European </p><p>Security Strategy progress and "emerging proposals" from the </p><p>April 29 Brussels Defense Mini-Summit.  Cooper added that the </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>European Security Strategy process was in its beginning </p><p>stages, and should include input from both the US and NATO as </p><p>it progresses.  He offered to travel to Washington for </p><p>consultations, and looked forward to a period of discussion </p><p>and "workshops" during the fall before detailed drafting </p><p>begins in November.  Valenzuela noted that European Security </p><p>Strategy would also encompass internal security issues, such </p><p>as energy and trade. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A/S Jones welcomed the Solana European Security </p><p>Strategy draft, and emphasized that it mirrors closely U.S. </p><p>views on ESDP\'s relationship to NATO.  She was pleased to </p><p>hear Aragona emphasize that the European Security Strategy </p><p>would complement and strengthen US-EU and EU-NATO security </p><p>relations, and accepted Cooper\'s offer to travel to </p><p>Washington for more detailed discussions - the U.S. wants to </p><p>collaborate in this process, and we look forward to seeing </p><p>the EU move concepts from paper to concrete actions. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ESDP Missions - Berlin Plus </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Aragona said that the three active ESDP missions </p><p>(Macedonia, Congo and Bosnia police) demonstrated that the EU </p><p>was committed to enhancing its security capabilities in line </p><p>with Berlin plus.  Europeans do not want to be "laggards" </p><p>when it comes to its security responsibilities, particularly </p><p>when they involve the Balkans.  Aragona noted that the </p><p>Copenhagen EU council expressed willingness for an EU </p><p>takeover of SFOR functions in Bosnia if and when conditions </p><p>merit a transfer from NATO command. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Cooper said that in his view, the EU-NATO relationship </p><p>has done well and come a long way from the Berlin plus </p><p>signing last December to launching Operation Concordia just </p><p>three months later.  The EU has "surprised itself" with the </p><p>rapidity with which it deployed to the Congo.  The EU intends </p><p>to be "out on time" from the Congo, which will make it easier </p><p>to deploy other operations in the future, as contributing </p><p>nations will be confident they will not be engaged in drawn </p><p>out operations.  Cooper emphasized that the military </p><p>deployment was but one aspect of the Congo operation.  The EU </p><p>will commit resources and personnel to stabilizing all </p><p>aspects of the Congo\'s political and economic </p><p>infrastructures.  Cooper reiterated that there was no </p><p>disagreement with the US on a possible EU takeover of SFOR </p><p>command in Bosnia - it will happen only when the U.S., EU and </p><p>NATO decide together that it is time. Cooney agreed, and </p><p>looked forward to a "real test" of Berlin plus in Bosnia.  He </p><p>also expressed satisfaction with the 550 "high quality" </p><p>officers deployed by the EU for police training in Bosnia </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Cooper said that he was not satisfied with some </p><p>aspects of the Berlin plus relationship, and not entirely </p><p>enthusiastic about the "political atmosphere" between NATO </p><p>and EU.  The EU and NATO had not yet developed a "habit" of </p><p>active cooperation.  SHAPE does not yet function as a </p><p>platform for Berlin plus and planning for EU operations. </p><p>This may be the result of growing pains and the fact that the </p><p>three ESDP operations thus far did not depend heavily on </p><p>sharing NATO assets or planning capabilities.  Aragona </p><p>averred that once ESDP and Berlin plus got up to "cruising </p><p>speed," these initial problems would evaporate. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) A/S Jones said that the USG was pleased that after </p><p>four years of negotiations between the EU and NATO, an ESDP </p><p>operation in accordance with Berlin plus was finally launched </p><p>in March to Macedonia, and she emphasizes this point with the </p><p>American public whenever possible.  It was unfortunate that </p><p>headlines from elsewhere in the world in March meant </p><p>Concordia did not receive the notice it deserved - especially </p><p>as it relates to the new relationship between ESDP and NATO. </p><p>A/S Jones pledged to work with the EU and NATO so that SHAPE </p><p>does in fact begin to feel like a proper military </p><p>headquarters for the EU.  Our main concern is that we avoid </p><p>duplication of capabilities and headquarters - we want to </p><p>streamline and become more efficient to more effectively </p><p>address new threats. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) A/S Jones reiterated that the U.S. remains open to an </p><p>EU takeover from SFOR in Bosnia, but not now.  The security </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>situation at the moment and unfinished business relating to </p><p>apprehending Persons Indicted for War Crimes and terrorists </p><p>call for a continued NATO presence of 12,000 personnel at </p><p>least through the fall.  In the Balkans we remain committed </p><p>to "in together - out together."  A/S Jones also praised the </p><p>police training mission in Bosnia, and hoped it could serve </p><p>as a model for missions to Afghanistan and Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Galileo </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) A/S Jones noted President Bush was clear that the </p><p>U.S. has strong political concerns about how Galileo\'s </p><p>planned overlay of the GPS M-code could adversely impact </p><p>Allied military communication.  She stressed that technical </p><p>experts have demonstrated that any overlay, even partial, </p><p>will interfere with Allied military capabilities.  She </p><p>reassured the EU that it is not our intention to have Galileo </p><p>be a second-class system; we believe that by separating GPS </p><p>and Galileo we could support the NATO Alliance without </p><p>degrading Galileo.  A/S Jones welcomed the EU offer to stay </p><p>in contact. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Valenzuela is hopeful that experts can find a </p><p>solution between the two extremes of satisfying security and </p><p>avoiding second-class status for Galileo.  He stressed the </p><p>importance of a clear political mandate and noted that we </p><p>have everything to gain from complementary systems and </p><p>nothing to gain by impeding one another.  He said that the EU </p><p>is ready to hold classified consultations regardless of </p><p>venue. Once the experts have worked out the issues, the </p><p>Commission will have to consider matters of cost, robustness, </p><p>and delays. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Aragona stressed Italy\'s desire to fully safeguard </p><p>U.S. security concerns, and noted the rest of the EU Member </p><p>States felt similarly.  However, he reiterated that it is </p><p>equally important Galileo be first class -- technologically </p><p>functional and credible.  He was glad to see this is fully </p><p>recognized by the U.S. administration and is confident that </p><p>we are moving ahead on a sound footing.  He applauded the </p><p>Commission\'s willingness to let the U.S. choose the venue for </p><p>the classified session, provided it is a U.S.-EU </p><p>conversation. Cooper added that it is important to keep the </p><p>prize in mind.  "If the technicians can make it work, two </p><p>systems are better than one -- and our people are instructed </p><p>to find a solution." </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) A/S Jones noted the question of venue will be </p><p>resolved, but stressed this situation may still require a </p><p>political-level decision, based on technical discussions, to </p><p>come to a firm conclusion.  Everyone agreed the next step was </p><p>open-minded technical talks.  David Cooney, Irish Political </p><p>Director, added that there is full consensus in the EU, </p><p>including non-NATO EU countries, that no one wants to </p><p>undermine the NATO alliance. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Middle East </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) A/S Jones noted that intense discussions are underway </p><p>bilaterally with both Sharon and Abu Mazen, and underscored </p><p>the need to continue working with Palestinians on prisoner </p><p>releases, fence and security issues, and with the Israelis on </p><p>security on the ground.  On the economic side, A/S Jones </p><p>raised need to move fast and get a direct budget for the </p><p>Palestinians in order to expand support for Abu Mazen and </p><p>enhance his ability to make agreements with Sharon for the </p><p>greater good.  Intense cooperation should continue with the </p><p>Quartet; both the U.S. and the EU must push both sides at the </p><p>GAERC and meetings in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Aragona confirmed the Middle East is a priority for </p><p>the Italian Presidency.  He welcomed the U.S. efforts, and </p><p>President Bush\'s increased involvement.  He agreed the </p><p>situation is fragile and requires commitment, which the EU is </p><p>ready to take on.  He explained Sharon and Abu Mazen would </p><p>appear in succession at the GAERC, and the EU would impress </p><p>upon them the need to move ahead with roadmap implementation. </p><p> Aragona stressed the need for a credible, effective </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>monitoring mechanism, and highlighted the appointment of new </p><p>special envoy, Ambassador Otte. Cooney noted the EU can play </p><p>a complementary role to push the Arabs to meet their </p><p>commitments, and  pointed out that the EU is not looking for </p><p>glory -- but is looking for peace.  Valenzuela raised the </p><p>importance of keeping the Palestinian Authority functioning </p><p>with economic support, and the need for the population itself </p><p>to see the dividends of peace.  He added that new focus on </p><p>the private sector would also have positive effects. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) A/S Jones noted the President wants the Quartet to </p><p>play a strong role to resolve the conflict, and that from the </p><p>U.S. perspective, each Quartet member should strive for equal </p><p>credibility with both parties for more effective agreements. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Counter-Terrorism </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) A/S Jones described U.S.-EU CT cooperatio as very </p><p>strong, especially between EU Justice ad Home Affairs (JHA) </p><p>experts and their U.S. counterparts.  This was highlighted </p><p>during the summit with the signing of the Mutual Legal </p><p>Assistance and Extradition agreements.  She noted progress on </p><p>terrorism finance, but urged the EU to designate all wings of </p><p>Hamas and Hizballah, and groups that raise funds for them, as </p><p>terrorist entities.  A/S Jones noted progress on resolving </p><p>remaining differences on the Container Security Initiative </p><p>and the Passenger Name Record programs, and looked forward to </p><p>closing remaining gaps.  Aragona reiterated the high priority </p><p>the EU places on CT cooperation and said the EU wants to </p><p>enhance cooperation in information collection and sharing and </p><p>terrorism finance. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Aragona said that EU Foreign Ministers will discuss </p><p>Hamas at the July 21-22 GAERC, an issue now "under constant </p><p>review."  However, he noted that Hamas\' respect for the </p><p>current ceasefire would need to be taken into account. Cooper </p><p>said Hamas was not a black and white issue for the EU.  Its </p><p>designation raised questions -- whether the international </p><p>community would ever want to include Hamas in a political </p><p>process; and how to replace the social services Hamas </p><p>provides Palestinians.  He said the EU has also talked </p><p>extensively to Abu Mazen about Hamas, and is "pulled in </p><p>different directions" regarding potential designation.  A/S </p><p>Jones pressed again for EU designation of Hamas and Hizballah </p><p>as terrorist organizations. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>International Criminal Court </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) Aragona stated his understanding of U.S. public and </p><p>congressional pressure against ICC, but noted the equally </p><p>strong conviction in Europe in support of the ICC and the </p><p>principle of international jurisdiction.  In addition, the EU </p><p>view is that the mechanisms of the ICC will protect against </p><p>the politicization of the court that the U.S. fears.  He said </p><p>the U.S. and EU needed to avoid "divisive engagement" on this </p><p>issue; in spite of our differences it was in U.S.-EU </p><p>interests to manage this issue successfully.  Aragona said </p><p>the EU\'s guiding principles on Article 98 agreements were not </p><p>a campaign against U.S. efforts to negotiate Article 98 </p><p>agreements.  Aragona said he hoped the ICC would establish a </p><p>track record that would persuade the U.S. to reconsider its </p><p>position. </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) A/S Jones clarified that there was no disagreement </p><p>between the U.S. and the EU over the importance of </p><p>prosecuting war crimes.  The disagreement was over the </p><p>failure, in drafting the Rome statute, to provide safeguard </p><p>mechanisms such as those applicable to the ICTY, making the </p><p>tribunals accountable to the international community.  Just </p><p>as countries tell us that for constitutional reasons they </p><p>cannot deploy troops abroad without a UN decision, we cannot </p><p>for constitutional reasons subject U.S. citizens to a </p><p>tribunal that is not accountable to the international </p><p>community.  A/S Jones noted that EU guidelines allow Member </p><p>States to negotiate Article 98 agreements.   She noted that </p><p>some Member State Ambassadors, with strong personal </p><p>convictions on the issue, have been overly eager to tell </p><p>accession countries that Article 98 agreements are not </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>allowed, or that signing an agreement could jeopardize EU </p><p>assistance funds.  We know this is not EU policy, and seek EU </p><p>help to clarify to Member State Ambassadors what is </p><p>appropriate for them to tell accession and third countries, </p><p>and what is not. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) Aragona replied that he could not exclude that some </p><p>Member State Ambassadors might have made the representations </p><p>described by A/S Jones, but the EU position on Article 98 </p><p>agreements is clear, and exists in writing.  The only </p><p>authorized way for the EU position to be conveyed to third </p><p>countries is via the Presidency or the EU Troika. Valenzuela </p><p>added that the notion that the EU could threaten to withhold </p><p>assistance from accession countries was remote.  The </p><p>procedures involved would include a European Court of Justice </p><p>decision -- after accession of the country concerned.  Cooney </p><p>noted that the U.S. and the EU had both given countries "a </p><p>pretty hard time" over Article 98 agreements, and cited U.S. </p><p>pressure, via withholding military assistance under </p><p>provisions of the American Servicemembers Protection Act </p><p>(ASPA) as an example.  Although Ireland was not a recipient </p><p>of US Security assistance, the application of ASPA to </p><p>Ireland, Cooney said, would not bring Ireland any closer to </p><p>signing an Article 98 agreement.  A/S Jones responded that </p><p>ASPA was the law of the land, and U.S. military assistance to </p><p>countries amounted to 1/100th of potential EU assistance to </p><p>accession states, so the two situations were not comparable. </p><p>(Comment.  Although little headway was made on the substance, </p><p>the direct but non-confrontational exchange of views allowed </p><p>both sides to clarify their concerns.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) A/S Jones provided an update of the situation in </p><p>Iraq, focusing on five key priorities: security issues, </p><p>improvement of quality of life, assistance from the </p><p>international community, development of self-governing </p><p>mechanisms, and economic revitalization.  She outlined </p><p>developments in police staffing and training, legal and </p><p>judicial reform, electricity production and supply, and the </p><p>establishment of the Iraqi Governing Council.  She noted </p><p>plans to convene a donors, conference in October, adding </p><p>that the US hopes the EU will be an active participant, </p><p>perhaps taking the opportunity of the July 21 GAERC to make </p><p>this commitment. </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) Aragona praised the creation of the IGC as an </p><p>important step, and agreed on the primary importance of </p><p>providing a secure environment in which Iraq,s most pressing </p><p>needs can be addressed.  He said the EU would continue to </p><p>work closely with Ambassador Bremer and his team.  While it </p><p>may be premature to get into specifics about the October </p><p>donors, conference, the US should be assured that the EU </p><p>will play a very supportive role on financial assistance and </p><p>reconstruction.  Aragona stressed the importance of Iraqis </p><p>&owning8 this process. </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) Aragona requested US views about an eventual UN role </p><p>in Iraq.  A/S Jones replied that UNSCR 1483 addresses </p><p>existing responsibilities.  The Allied Coalition understands </p><p>and accepts its responsibilities, and will focus on the five </p><p>priorities outlined earlier.  Any discussion of transfer of </p><p>authority would, at this point, be premature. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Afghanistan </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) A/S Jones noted that the Afghanistan government </p><p>projects a budget shortfall of over 180 million USD.  The EU </p><p>has already committed 50 million USD; we hope it will give </p><p>another 20 million.  Additionally, Afghan elections are </p><p>expected to cost about 100 million USD; we trust that the EU </p><p>will also be supportive of that process.  A/S Jones briefed </p><p>on the Provincial Reconstruction Team program and urged EU </p><p>participation.  She also expressed appreciation for the </p><p>willingness of the EC,s Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) to </p><p>permit personnel of the Coalition Joint Civil-Military </p><p>Operations Task Force (CJCMOTF) to use UN Humanitarian Air </p><p>Service flights for crucial transport, and urged ECHO to </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>extend such usage beyond August 1. </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) Cooney expressed concern that constitutional </p><p>consultations were taking place without circulation of draft </p><p>texts, saying this was giving rise to suspicions that the </p><p>process was not really inclusive.  Cooney also expressed </p><p>concern about possible delays in the electoral process. </p><p>Cooper added that there is a growing perception among many </p><p>Afghans that a &fix8 is in which will simply ratify </p><p>existing powers. </p><p> </p><p>27. (C) Valenzuela said the EU is on track to meet its pledge </p><p>of one billion Euros over five years, with outlays during the </p><p>current year totaling over 200 million.  He recognized the </p><p>need for electoral funding, but was noncommittal, noting that </p><p>the EC budget is already stretched.  Valenzuela also echoed </p><p>Cooper,s concerns that the electoral process not be </p><p>perceived as favoring status quo warlord power.  In that </p><p>regard, he expressed general support for extending Kabul,s </p><p>power and influence into the provinces, but said present </p><p>plans do not envision EU participation in the PRT,s. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Nonproliferation </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>28. (C) Aragona said that the conceptual framework for NP </p><p>coordination is contained in the EU Strategy Against </p><p>Proliferation of WMD; now we should focus on practical </p><p>measures in Iran and North Korea.  A/S Jones expressed </p><p>appreciation for the development and launch of the </p><p>nonproliferation initiative.  While we recognize that there </p><p>are some differences of perception, we agree that there are </p><p>ample opportunities for cooperative action.  A/S Jones </p><p>expressed US concerns about proceeding with an initiative in </p><p>the UNGA, but said the US is willing to discuss this </p><p>possibility with EU experts. </p><p> </p><p>29. (C) Cooper said the Commission has developed four main </p><p>areas of emphasis.  First, the IAEA has proven very useful, </p><p>most recently with Iran.  Second, the EU will, in </p><p>consultation with the U.S., review all of its treaty </p><p>relationships with a view to adopting language requiring </p><p>nonproliferation cooperation.  Third, the Commission wishes </p><p>to review (at 25) the best practices of various </p><p>nonproliferation regimes.  Finally, Cooper lauded the </p><p>Proliferation Security Initiative, but noted that not all EU </p><p>member states were asked to participate in PSI, and asked </p><p>whether such EU participation might be possible.   A/S Jones </p><p>said the US would welcome broader participation that expands </p><p>the effectiveness of the PSI.  Aragona said that, as one of </p><p>the original PSI participants and EU Presidency country, </p><p>Italy might be well placed to explore the idea of greater </p><p>inclusiveness. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iran </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>30. (C) Aragona noted that Italian FM Frattini recently told </p><p>his Iranian counterpart that prompt and unconditional </p><p>agreement to the Additional Protocol sought by the IAEA is </p><p>essential. He said that political dialogue and economic </p><p>cooperation must be linked, and we should balance our </p><p>approaches and avoid steps that might prove </p><p>counterproductive.  A/S Jones said the U.S. and EU should </p><p>develop a strategy to use the next IAEA report, which will </p><p>reportedly be very critical of Tehran.  The U.S. recognizes </p><p>that Iran is divided; the key question is how to influence </p><p>internal dynamics to achieve the changes in Iranian policy </p><p>that we seek. </p><p>----------- </p><p>North Korea </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>31. (C) Aragona said that North Korea\'s WMD program is a </p><p>multilateral, global problem, and needs a joint and </p><p>coordinated response. He expressed hope that China might be </p><p>able to foster a renewal of dialogue with the DPRK.  A/S </p><p>Jones welcomed Aragona,s recognition that North Korean </p><p>proliferation is a global issue.  The criminality of the </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>regime is also a factor.  Valenzuela lauded the intensity of </p><p>U.S. dialogue with China and Japan on North Korea, but </p><p>expressed concern that discussions with other KEDO members </p><p>outside the framework of KEDO might affect that body, and </p><p>asked that we keep the EU in the loop on all KEDO-related </p><p>matters. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Russia </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>32. (C) Aragona said the EU is making progress with Russia on </p><p>border/immigration issues, combating organized crime and drug </p><p>trafficking.  The EU raises Chechnya and human rights issues, </p><p>but has not had much success. The EU assessment is the </p><p>Russians are content with their role within the Quartet.  On </p><p>Moldova, Aragona said that Russian FM Ivanov is extremely </p><p>uncomfortable with any "outside" role in a settlement.  On </p><p>nonproliferation, Aragona said the Russians may be moving in </p><p> </p><p>the right direction, but this was an Italian national </p><p>assessment. </p><p> </p><p>33. (C) A/S Jones urged the EU to use Russia\'s desire for </p><p>good relations with the West to promote reforms.  On </p><p>Chechnya, despite Russian extreme sensitivities, the U.S. </p><p>raises it at all levels, including at summit meetings, </p><p>pointing out that there must be a political solution that </p><p>also addresses underlying causes.  On human rights/media </p><p>freedom and economic reform, much still needs to be done. </p><p>The U.S. is concerned about Putin\'s recent closure of TV </p><p>stations. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Moldova/Frozen Conflicts </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>34. (C) A/S Jones outlined U.S. frustration with the Russian </p><p>MFA "stone wall" that blocks any effort to move ahead on </p><p>Moldova or any of the frozen conflicts.  The U.S. strategy, </p><p>which is still being developed, is to say to Moscow that if </p><p>it wants good relations with the U.S. and the West (e.g. visa </p><p>free travel with the EU) then it can\'t say the EU has no </p><p>voice in a Moldova settlement.  A/S Jones outlined upcoming </p><p>U.S.-Russian meetings that can be used to raise these issues </p><p>above the level of the MFA, and said the U.S. would welcome a </p><p>similar EU effort.  Russia cannot be allowed to take "Cold </p><p>War" positions on Moldova and Georgia. </p><p> </p><p>35. (C) Cooney agreed there was a big gap between Russian </p><p>rhetoric and action, and outlined three reasons why the EU </p><p>sought a role in a Moldova settlement.  First, the EU wants </p><p>conflict resolved on what will be its borders.  Second, </p><p>Moldova is an economic basket case -- per capita GDP is two </p><p>percent of the EU average and it is a source of organized </p><p>crime and trafficking in persons.  Third, the EU wants a </p><p>resolution in Moldova before enlargement encompasses Romania </p><p>in order to avoid further tension along that border.  Cooney </p><p>noted that public discussion of a potential EU peacekeeping </p><p>force in Moldova was not helpful in reaching a political </p><p>settlement -- it would just upset the Russians.  Aragona </p><p>added that no decisions have been taken; when the day comes </p><p>that the OSCE does reach a decision, and if the OSCE asks the </p><p>EU to take this role, the EU will have to take the Russian </p><p>connection to Moldova into account.  A/S Jones said that the </p><p>U.S. was open to an EU stabilization force in Moldova, under </p><p>an OSCE mandate, and would want such a mission to draw on </p><p>NATO planning.  It should follow the Macedonia, not Congo, </p><p>model since it would be in the European theatre. </p><p> </p><p>36 (U)  A/S Jones has cleared this cable. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03368 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
