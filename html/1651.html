THE SOUTHERN DELEGATION (WHICH INCLUDED </p><p>ONE CAO DAI REPRESENTATIVE) ATTEMPTED TO MEET PRIVATELY </p><p>WITH THE VIET MINH DELEGATION HEADED BY PHAM VAN DONG AND </p><p>PHAN ANH.  BUT DONG CALLED THE SOUTHERN DELEGATES PUPPETS </p><p>OF THE FRENCH, AND THE PROPOSAL NEVER BORE FRUIT.  IN AN </p><p>ATTEMPT TO RESTART THE INITIATIVE, PHAM CONG TAC, CAO DAI </p><p>POPE AT THE TIME, INVITED DONG AND THE THREE OTHER VIET </p><p>MINH DELEGATES TO DINNER.  THEY REFUSED, BUT OFFERED TO </p><p>HOST THEIR OWN DINNER FOR PHAM CONG TAC.  THE CAO DAI POPE </p><p>ALSO REFUSED THE DINNER INVITATION, BUT THE CAO DAI AND </p><p>THE VIET MINH EVENTUALLY DID AGREE AT LEAST TO MEET. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE CAO DAI AND VIET MINH HAD BEEN BITTER ENEMIES. </p><p>VIET MINH FORCES ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE KILLED THOUSANDS OF </p><p>CAO DAI FOLLOWERS AND DIGNITARIES FROM 1946-48.  AT THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THEIR MEETING, PHAM CONG TAC REPORTEDLY TOLD </p><p>PHAM VAN DONG THAT VIETNAM SHOULD FIND ITS OWN IDEOLOGY </p><p>AND NOT FOLLOW THAT OF CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION. </p><p>INDEPENDENCE FROM COLONIALISM WHILE FOLLOWING COMMUNISM, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00488  260658Z </p><p>PHAM CONG TAC REPORTEDLY SAID, WOULD BE LIKE A PRISONER </p><p>BREAKING HIS HANDCUFFS FROM THE WALL ONLY TO ROAM WITHIN </p><p>HIS PRISON CELL. </p><p> </p><p>3.

PHAM VAN DONG PROMISED </p><p>TO MAKE A VISIT TO THE CAO DAI TEMPLE IN TAY NINH. </p><p>(REMINDED OF THIS PROMISE IN 1991, DONG REPORTEDLY SAID </p><p>THAT FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THE TIME WAS NOT YET RIGHT. </p><p>HE NEVER MADE THE TRIP.) </p><p> </p><p>4. AT THE NEXT FORMAL SESSION IN GENEVA, WHEN THE VIET </p><p>MINH DELEGATION WALKED INTO THE ROOM, THE CAO DAI </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SOUTHERN DELEGATION (WHO HAD BEEN </p><p>AT THE PHAM CONG TAC/PHAM VAN DONG MEETING) STOOD UP AND </p><p>BOWED TO PHAM VAN DONG.  DONG IN TURN BOWED TO THE CAO DAI </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE.  THE SOUTHERN DELEGATION TOOK THIS AS A </p><p>BOW TO THEM ALL COLLECTIVELY, AND THEY IN TURN STOOD UP </p><p>AND BOWED TO THE VIET MINH DELEGATION, WHO IN TURN THEN </p><p>RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT.  ACCORDING TO THE CAO DAI </p><p>RELIGIOUS ELDER WHO RELATED THE STORY, THE FRENCH </p><p>DELEGATION LOOKED ON IN AMAZEMENT AT THIS BOWING BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO SIDES WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY REFUSED TO TALK TO EACH </p><p>OTHER AT THE FORMAL ROUNDS.  THE GENEVA TALKS ENDED WITH </p><p>"ACCORDS" THAT PARTITIONED THE COUNTRY, AND CALLED FOR A </p><p>CEASE-FIRE AND ELECTIONS.  THE REST, AS WE KNOW, IS </p><p>HISTORY. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00488  260658Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
