End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) BEGIN MEPI STRATEGY TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Introduction and Overview </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>In the past two years, the U.S.-Yemeni relationship made </p><p>great strides: Yemen is a key partner in the war on </p><p>terrorism, a USAID office re-opened, and recent </p><p>Parliamentary elections demonstrate that Yemen is making </p><p>solid democratic progress.   However, internal instabilities </p><p>are threatening the country\'s move towards greater democracy </p><p>and economic freedom, which could possibly weaken the U.S.- </p><p>Yemen partnership against terrorism. Extreme poverty, an </p><p>uneducated populace, inexperienced civil society, and </p><p>traditional tribal order all threaten Yemen\'s ability to </p><p>move forward. </p><p> </p><p>Over the next five years, Embassy Sanaa\'s MEPI goals are </p><p>aimed at giving Yemen an opportunity to provide its citizens </p><p>with more educational opportunities, stronger democratic </p><p>institutions, and improved economic conditions.  MEPI </p><p>initiatives will expand choices in education, government, </p><p>and economics to empower all Yemenis, including the </p><p>traditionally marginalized categories of the poor, women, </p><p>and children, to become active participants in all aspects </p><p>of Yemeni society. </p><p> </p><p>Specifically, we expect Yemen to have made great strides in </p><p>its security situation, buttressed by significant progress </p><p>in democracy. A diversified economy will provide jobs for a </p><p>growing population.  In education, we envision greater </p><p>access to schools for both girls and boys, and more </p><p>education choices that lead toward jobs in the private </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p>Specifically, Embassy Sanaa requests MEPI funding for: </p><p> </p><p>Education Reform </p><p>  1)   Expanding basic education and literacy; </p><p>2)   Increasing English language training; </p><p>3)   Improving technical training; and </p><p>  4) Expanding U.S.- Yemeni Education and Research </p><p>  Cooperation </p><p> </p><p>Political Reform </p><p>  1)   Strengthening democratic institutions </p><p>2)   Improving electoral processes </p><p>3)   Reforming the judiciary </p><p>4)   Increasing the professionalism of media organizations </p><p>and journalists </p><p> </p><p>Economic Reform </p><p>  1)   Increasing trade and investment </p><p>2)   Expanding employment and business opportunities at the </p><p>local level </p><p>3)   Enhancing policy reform and program development </p><p> </p><p>Each pillar strategy is comprehensive and includes an </p><p>analysis of the need for reform along with achievable and </p><p>measurable results. The entire MEPI strategy corresponds to </p><p>our 2005 MPP plan, including Goal 3: Democratic Systems and </p><p>Practices; Goal 4: Economic Growth and Development; and Goal </p><p>5: International Public Opinion.  Based on this strategy, </p><p>Embassy Sanaa looks forward to working closely with MEPI and </p><p>USAID personnel to develop specific activities and Request </p><p>for Grant Proposals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Education </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>The quality of education and training helps determine </p><p>economic development and social progress in Yemen. </p><p>Therefore, Embassy Sanaa will focus on raising education </p><p>standards and providing the training needed to meet the </p><p>demands of the modern business environment and increased </p><p>trade. Higher education standards will also create an </p><p>improved climate for development goals.   Corresponding with </p><p>Post\'s MPP Economic Growth and Development and International </p><p>Public Opinion goals, the MEPI Education strategy includes </p><p>support for:  1) Expanding basic education and literacy; 2) </p><p>Increasing English language training; 3) Improving technical </p><p>training; and 4) Expanding US-Yemeni education and research </p><p>cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>1. Expanding Basic Education and Literacy </p><p> </p><p>Problem: Only half of all Yemeni children aged 6 to 11 </p><p>enroll in school and gender disparity is pronounced, </p><p>especially in rural areas where only 30% of girls attend </p><p>school and two-thirds drop out before completing their </p><p>primary education.  In the rural areas where three-fourths </p><p>of Yemenis live, 68% of men and 94% of women have had no </p><p>formal education or have failed to complete primary school. </p><p>Nearly all (91%) never-married rural women are illiterate. </p><p>Only 60 percent of teachers have a basic education, or at </p><p>most, one to two years of secondary school.  The majority of </p><p>children in grades 4-6 have difficulty relating what they </p><p>learn in schools to their daily lives. Most pupils have </p><p>limited ability to read, write or solve problems.  There are </p><p>shortages of teachers and teaching materials.  Constraints </p><p>also include severe overcrowding, insufficient numbers of </p><p>schools and inadequate school buildings. </p><p> </p><p>In Yemen, girls are more likely to enroll and stay in school </p><p>if they have female teachers, but only a fifth of Yemeni </p><p>teachers are women and only 8% of those women teachers work </p><p>in the rural areas.  Only 56% of schools have any toilet </p><p>facilities and few have separate facilities for girls. </p><p>Overcrowded co-educational classrooms also deter girls\' </p><p>enrollment and retention because families feel uncomfortable </p><p>with the close physical proximity of male and female </p><p>students. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: </p><p> </p><p>The USG education strategy in Yemen focuses on basic </p><p>education (grades 1-6), improved literacy, especially for </p><p>women and girls, and education reform.  To carry out these </p><p>goals, Embassy Sanaa seeks MEPI funding in the following </p><p>areas: 1) Enhancing access to quality primary education in </p><p>the public sector; 2) Increasing literacy and numeracy for </p><p>adults and out-of-school youth at the community level; and, </p><p>3) Improving the environment for public education. </p><p> </p><p>1. Enhancing access to quality primary education in the </p><p>public sector: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Build, renovate and equip elementary schools in </p><p>     partnership with community organizations. Special </p><p>     attention will be paid to physical constraints to </p><p>     girls\' participation (e.g. separate latrines) </p><p> </p><p>     -- Train teachers (especially female teachers) with a </p><p>     focus on improved students\' ability to think abstractly </p><p>     and solve problems </p><p> </p><p>     -- Train administrators to better manage limited </p><p>     resources and increase engagement with the community </p><p> </p><p>2. Increasing literacy and numeracy for adults and out-of- </p><p>school youth at the community level: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Create opportunities for illiterate men, women and </p><p>     children in rural communities to learn to read, write </p><p>     and do basic math in programs related to their needs. </p><p>     Community-based activities may include </p><p>     radio/video/internet distance-learning and parents\' and </p><p>     women\'s education circles </p><p> </p><p>3.  Improving the environment for public education </p><p> </p><p>     -- Develop district and governorate education plans </p><p>     with community participation; Increase citizen input by </p><p>     providing education planning and program grants </p><p>     -- Promote new teaching approaches, i.e., interactive </p><p>     and inquiry-based learning </p><p>     -- Develop policies to increase girls\' enrollment and </p><p>     retention in school </p><p>     -- Structure outreach programs to educate adults and </p><p>     out-of-school youth </p><p>     -- Provide technical assistance to the Ministry of </p><p>     Education and the district and governorate education </p><p>     offices to implement the ROYG decentralization </p><p>     objectives and the ROYG Basic Education Strategy </p><p>     -- Provide technical assistance to the ROYG at all </p><p>     levels to collect and use education data for planning </p><p>     and management </p><p>     -- Develop IT applications that can be used with solar </p><p>     and satellite technology </p><p>     -- Develop programs to improve public attitudes </p><p>     regarding the value of education, especially for girls </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Increased number of teachers trained in interactive, </p><p>     inquiry-based, teaching methods </p><p>     -- Increased number of administrators trained, with a </p><p>     focus on maximizing limited resources </p><p>     -- Education facilities improved </p><p>     -- Increased average number of days teachers spend in </p><p>     the classroom </p><p>     -- Increased enrollment and retention of girls in </p><p>     school </p><p>     -- Increased numbers of adults and out-of-school youth </p><p>     with improved basic literacy and numeracy skills </p><p>     -- Expanded communities receiving education outreach </p><p>     services </p><p>     -- Community-based education organizations formed or </p><p>     strengthened </p><p>     -- District and governorate education plans and </p><p>     resource allocation budgets prepared with community </p><p>     participation </p><p>     -- District and governorate education offices with data- </p><p>     based planning capacity; District education offices </p><p>     that plan and share budget information with the </p><p>     community </p><p> </p><p>2.  Increasing English Language Training </p><p> </p><p>Problem: English language instruction is uneven throughout </p><p>the Republic of Yemen.  In Sanaa, English has become a </p><p>"second language," where it is routinely used in business, </p><p>educational and diplomatic endeavors.  The Yemen America </p><p>Language Institute (YALI)\'s high enrollment figures </p><p>(approximately 1,350 students per term), the number of new </p><p>language institutes, and the number of professional job </p><p>vacancies requiring English proficiency all point to a clear </p><p>demand for quality English language instruction. </p><p> </p><p>Outside of Sanaa, however, a far lower percentage of the </p><p>population has any working knowledge of English.  Moreover, </p><p>there are few venues to learn English outside of Yemeni </p><p>schools and universities in the major cities.  Even where </p><p>English is taught, the quality of language teaching is </p><p>mediocre.   Without increased opportunities to learn </p><p>English, Yemen\'s development options will continue to be </p><p>limited along with the American-Yemeni political, economic, </p><p>and cultural relations. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: </p><p> </p><p>To improve the quality of English language training in Yemen </p><p>and to expand access to English instruction, Embassy Sanaa </p><p>seeks MEPI funding to: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Expand English language instruction in rural Yemen </p><p>     -- Provide training in technical and specialty topics </p><p>     (e.g. medical, auxiliary health services, public </p><p>     administration, engineering, business, trade, finance) </p><p>     -- Offer stipends (tuition, fees, materials, </p><p>     transportation and living expenses) for students and in- </p><p>     service training </p><p>     -- Train English teachers in improved methodology and </p><p>     curriculum </p><p>     -- Supply instructional materials to expand English in </p><p>     public sector classrooms </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p>     -- Increased numbers of schools and language centers </p><p>     teaching English </p><p>     -- Expanded pool of teachers able to teach English </p><p>     -- More Yemenis able to communicate and work in English </p><p> </p><p>3. Expanding Technical Training: </p><p> </p><p>Problem: There are too few job opportunities for Yemen\'s </p><p>growing population.  For those who have a high school </p><p>education, finding work is difficult because their skills </p><p>often do not match the needs in the public and private </p><p>sectors.  Adults also do not have the skills now demanded by </p><p>the labor market and must be retrained.  Furthermore, those </p><p>who have academic degrees often lack the practical skills </p><p>required by employers. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: </p><p> </p><p>To provide appropriate training suitable for the job market </p><p>in Yemen and to enhance education opportunities for Yemenis, </p><p>the Embassy seeks to use MEPI funding to: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Train teachers at technical universities in updated </p><p>     teaching methodology </p><p>     -- Strengthen Community College management and their </p><p>     ability to provide practical, job-related training </p><p>     -- Promote workforce development centers with the </p><p>     private and public sectors </p><p>     -- Develop curricula in basic technical areas such as: </p><p>     computer skills, laboratory technicians, medical </p><p>     equipment operators and repair technicians, </p><p>     electronics, management, accounting, building </p><p>     management, construction management, hotel and tourism </p><p>     administration </p><p>     -- Offer scholarships to enable students to attend </p><p>     technical training (tuition, fees, materials, </p><p>     transportation and living expenses) </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p>     -- Increased enrollment at technical institutes </p><p>     -- Strengthened community college system, including </p><p>     increased enrollment </p><p>     -- Workforce development centers established in </p><p>     partnership with the private and public sectors </p><p>     -- New curricula and teaching materials developed and </p><p>     used by teachers </p><p>     -- Expanded number of students trained and placed in </p><p>     jobs </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Expanding US/Yemeni Education and Research Cooperation: </p><p> </p><p>Problem: American researchers who wish to visit Yemen lack a </p><p>permanent home from where to base their research. Presently, </p><p>the American Institute of Yemeni Studies (AYIS), the premier </p><p>institute of its kind in Sanaa, has been operating out of </p><p>ill-equipped, leased quarters.  As a result, AIYS is unable </p><p>to expand its cultural outreach activities that promote </p><p>deeper understanding between Yemen and America. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: Post seeks funding to acquire a facility for </p><p>AIYS. </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p>     -- Enhanced U.S.- Yemen cooperation in research and </p><p>     cultural exchanges </p><p>     -- Establishment of a permanent home for the American </p><p>     Institute of Yemeni Studies </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Political Reform </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>Despite a weak economy, nascent democratic development, and </p><p>few examples to draw from in the Middle East, Yemen has </p><p>moved towards significant political reform since 1990. </p><p>Yemen has universal suffrage, a multi-party system, elected </p><p>national and local representatives, and an active, if still- </p><p>developing, civil society sector.  However, recent April </p><p>2003 parliamentary elections exposed the considerable </p><p>weaknesses that remain in Yemen\'s political reform efforts, </p><p>including allegations of fraud, a lack of support for women </p><p>candidates, and a judicial and media system that favored the </p><p>ruling party. </p><p> </p><p>With local council and presidential elections scheduled for </p><p>2006 providing an important opportunity, the MEPI goals of </p><p>strengthening democratic processes, promoting the rule of </p><p>law and accountable, effective government institutions, and </p><p>strengthening the role of media in society will help </p><p>strengthen citizens\' participation in democratic life and </p><p>foster a society in which adherence to the rule of law is </p><p>the norm.  Corresponding with Post\'s MPP Democratic Systems </p><p>and Practices goal, the Embassy Sanaa strategy for MEPI </p><p>political reform support includes the following categories: </p><p>1) Strengthening democratic institutions; 2) Improving </p><p>electoral processes; 3) Reforming the judiciary; and, 4) </p><p>Increasing the professionalism of media organizations and </p><p>journalists. </p><p> </p><p>1.  Strengthening Democratic Institutions </p><p> </p><p>Problem:  Yemen\'s democratic institutions remain fragile, </p><p>which reduces the avenues by which strong democratic reform </p><p>can take root, particularly regarding the inclusion of women </p><p>and other underrepresented groups.  Local councils, elected </p><p>in 2001, represent an arm of government close to the </p><p>citizens where women and opposition parties stand a much </p><p>better chance to take advantage of political life. However, </p><p>local councils lack the resources, skills, and knowledge of </p><p>their power to function properly.  ROYG Ministry offices at </p><p>the district and governorate levels lack the ability, </p><p>resources, and experience to implement ROYG decentralization </p><p>policy, and engage effectively with elected officials and </p><p>citizens. </p><p>The Parliament also remains weak and is not effective in </p><p>providing oversight of the executive branch of ROYG, </p><p>drafting legislation, or representing constituents.   While </p><p>Yemen enjoys an active multi-party system, the ruling party </p><p>dominates the political scene and all parties lack a clear </p><p>long-term strategy, a membership base that represents </p><p>citizens, and a democratic internal structure.  Strong </p><p>political parties that effectively represent Yemenis are </p><p>needed to consolidate democratic progress.  In a similar </p><p>way, most non-governmental organizations (NGOs) suffer from </p><p>poor organization, little experience, and unfocused goals </p><p>that reduce their ability to advocate effectively on behalf </p><p>of the community, particularly outside of urban areas. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: </p><p> </p><p>To strengthen democratic institutions, Embassy Sanaa seeks </p><p>MEPI funding for long-term multi-year programs for </p><p>activities in the following areas: 1) Increasing democratic </p><p>participation; 2) Encouraging decentralization; and, 3) </p><p>developing the NGO sector and civil society. </p><p> </p><p>1. Increasing Democratic Participation </p><p> </p><p>     -- Local council governance program to assist members </p><p>     to better represent their constituents and act as more </p><p>     effective officials through training on their legally </p><p>     mandated roles and responsibilities, including </p><p>     integrating traditional tribal culture into democratic </p><p>     political culture.  (FY O2 MEPI funds have funded the </p><p>     first-phase of this project via the National Democratic </p><p>     Institute (NDI) through March 04.) </p><p>     -- Parliamentary strengthening program to build the </p><p>     institutional capacity and increase the ability of </p><p>     parliament to act as an independent entity through </p><p>     training new members, fostering communication between </p><p>     democratic institutions and improving constituency </p><p>     relations </p><p>     -- Political party strengthening program to consolidate </p><p>     party representation of citizens and strong multi-party </p><p>     competition </p><p>     -- Women in politics program to improve the skills and </p><p>     knowledge of women office holders and increase the </p><p>     number and efficacy of future women candidates for </p><p>     public office as a complement and follow-on program to </p><p>     the regional campaign training schools program that </p><p>     began in November 2002 and ongoing NDI programming. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Encouraging Decentralization: </p><p> </p><p>    -- Pilot decentralization projects in selected </p><p>    governorates to train and equip local councils to </p><p>    manage resources and provide services to constituents </p><p>    -- Pilot decentralization projects in selected </p><p>    governorates to train and equip local offices of ROYG </p><p>    Ministries to engage effectively with local councils </p><p>    and citizens to plan and implement sectoral programs </p><p> </p><p>3.   Developing the NGO sector and Civil Society: </p><p> </p><p>    -- Enable the NGO sector and civil society to </p><p>    effectively participate in community and human rights </p><p>    development through training interventions and </p><p>    establishing an NGO support center </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p>     -- Increased numbers of local councils that represent </p><p>     citizens effectively, obtain and allocate resources </p><p>     wisely, provide needed services to the community, </p><p>     integrate tribal culture and offer avenues for women </p><p>     and other disadvantaged groups to participate in </p><p>     democratic life </p><p>     -- Increased number of times Parliament challenges </p><p>     government initiatives or amends legislation </p><p>     -- Increased number of Members of Parliament (MPs) who </p><p>     represent constituents effectively </p><p>     -- Increased use of strategic planning and internal </p><p>     democratic processes by political parties </p><p>     -- Increased party membership base representing </p><p>     citizens across Yemen </p><p>     -- Increased multi-party competition resulting in a </p><p>     more balanced political spectrum </p><p>     -- Increased numbers of women in elected office </p><p>     -- Increased numbers of elected women and men with the </p><p>     ability to advocate effectively on issues </p><p>     -- Increased efficacy and number of NGOs that </p><p>     effectively advocate on behalf of citizens </p><p>     -- Increased number of district and governorate offices </p><p>     of ROYG Ministries that engage substantively with local </p><p>     councils and citizens in program planning and resource </p><p>     allocation </p><p>2.  Improving Electoral Processes </p><p> </p><p>Problem: The April 2003 parliamentary elections marked an </p><p>improvement in Yemen\'s electoral process, but significant </p><p>flaws show that much more work is needed to build confidence </p><p>in the electoral process.  With local council and </p><p>presidential elections scheduled for 2006, problems with the </p><p>voter registry (caused by a lack of civil registry </p><p>documenting citizens accurately that allowed significant </p><p>underage voting), election administration, political party </p><p>fraud, and citizen confidence in the election must be </p><p>addressed. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: </p><p>To improve the electoral process, Embassy Sanaa seeks </p><p>support for the following long-term programs: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Continue to assist to the Supreme Committee for </p><p>     Elections and Referenda (SCER) to professionalize its </p><p>     operations and to administer the 2006 elections in an </p><p>     effective, independent and confidence-building manner </p><p>     -- Assist the ROYG and SCER to develop a modern, cost- </p><p>     effective, accurate and comprehensive civil registry </p><p>     -- Support and train Yemeni civil society groups to </p><p>     monitor the elections to help ensure confidence in the </p><p>     election and to foster political party confidence in </p><p>     the SCER and election administration </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Increased professionalism in the SCER resulting in </p><p>     effective management of and confidence in the electoral </p><p>     process </p><p>     -- The first-ever civil registry in Yemen and </p><p>     government identification cards for all Yemenis </p><p>     -- Improved accuracy in voter registration and other </p><p>     benefits, including citizen access to basic services </p><p>     and more effective counter-terrorism measures </p><p>     -- Increased confidence in election results through </p><p>     monitoring and effective adjudication of citizen, NGO </p><p>     and political party concerns </p><p> </p><p>3.  Reforming the Judiciary </p><p> </p><p>Problem: Yemen\'s judicial system needs comprehensive reform, </p><p>including reconciling differing pre-unification laws, de- </p><p>politicizing judges, strengthening the application and </p><p>implementation of law, training more effective and fair </p><p>judges, and effectively responding to human rights concerns. </p><p>The absence of effective rule of law affects all aspects of </p><p>Yemeni society negatively, including undermining the </p><p>stability of land tenure, fostering a reliance on tribal </p><p>adjudication outside the political system, and negative </p><p>impacts on expanded trade and investment. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: </p><p> </p><p>Participate in the MidEast Regional Judicial Reform program </p><p>and design effective follow-up programming within the Yemeni </p><p>judicial system by training judges, assisting in the reform </p><p>and effective implementation of key laws, and encouraging </p><p>the non-politicization of judges. </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Improved information sharing of best practices in </p><p>     judicial reform across the region </p><p>     -- Increased number of judges that are impartial and </p><p>     give fair judgments </p><p>     -- Increased number of needed laws that are implemented </p><p>     effectively </p><p>     -- Increased confidence and transparency in the </p><p>     judicial system, lessening the reliance on traditional </p><p>     tribal justice </p><p> </p><p>4.  Increasing the Professionalism of Media Organizations </p><p>and Journalists </p><p> </p><p>Problem:  While Yemen has a fairly active government and </p><p>opposition written press compared to other countries in the </p><p>Middle East, it suffers from ruling-party dominated </p><p>broadcast media, government oppression of journalists, and a </p><p>lack of professional journalists trained in investigative </p><p>and factual reporting. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: </p><p> </p><p>To increase the professionalism of media organizations and </p><p>journalists, Embassy Sanaa seeks funding to establish a </p><p>Media Training Center to: </p><p>     -- Provide working journalists with best practices and </p><p>     methods of journalism, including investigative and </p><p>     factual reporting </p><p>     -- Offer training and support to foster a more </p><p>     effective media sector </p><p>     -- Work to reduce government oppression of the media </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p>     -- Increased professionalism of journalists resulting </p><p>     in more effective reporting and decreased oppression of </p><p>     journalists </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Economic Growth </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>One of the 25 poorest and least developed countries in the </p><p>world, Yemen\'s real GDP per capita is approximately US$300. </p><p>According to the World Bank, GDP growth for 2002 was 2.9 %, </p><p>which does not match population growth of 3.5% a year. </p><p>Unemployment is estimated to be 25-35%, and oil resources, </p><p>which account for one third of the gross national product </p><p>and 70% of government revenues, are expected to decline </p><p>significantly during the next decade.  Despite these </p><p>negative indicators, many international donors praised </p><p>Yemen\'s fiscal policy and progress in economic reform </p><p>throughout the last five years. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI goals encouraging foreign direct investment and </p><p>developing revenue and employment growth will help diversify </p><p>and strengthen the Yemeni economy by providing jobs, </p><p>expanding the economic base, and, in the long term, lessen </p><p>Yemen\'s dependence on oil.  Corresponding to its MPP </p><p>Economic Growth and Development goal, the Embassy Sanaa </p><p>strategy for MEPI economic reform support has three goals: </p><p>1) Increasing trade and investment; 2) Expanding employment </p><p>and business opportunities at the local level; and, 3) </p><p>Enhancing policy reform and program development. </p><p> </p><p>1.  Increasing Trade and Investment </p><p> </p><p>Problem: Yemen is considered by the World Bank to be among </p><p>the most open and trade liberalized countries in the MENA </p><p>region. However, oil exports represented more than 95 </p><p>percent of total merchandise exports in 2000. Of the </p><p>remaining 5 percent, products such as fish, coffee, fruits, </p><p>and vegetables are low value added. This fact made economic </p><p>growth in Yemen vulnerable to volatility in price and </p><p>demand. </p><p> </p><p>Obstacles constraining the growth potential and development </p><p>of export-potential sectors are: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Weak institutional and organizational structures </p><p>     that fail to uphold competition and prevent monopoly, </p><p>     ensure good quality products and protect intellectual </p><p>     property rights </p><p>     -- Limited infrastructure necessary to enhance </p><p>     exporting activities </p><p>     -- Limited-quality economic, population and trade data </p><p>     -- Limited information about markets and demand for </p><p>     products </p><p>     -- Informal activities that dominate the private sector </p><p>     -- Lack of technical know-how, product quality and </p><p>     trade experience resulting in the inability to meet </p><p>     international standards </p><p> </p><p>Similar constraints also restrict the ability of Yemeni </p><p>producers to contribute to internal economic growth and </p><p>employment creation by exporting their products to markets </p><p>within Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>Foreign investors are discouraged from investing in Yemen </p><p>because the commercial legal system is ill-equipped to </p><p>adjudicate disputes. Judges are often unfamiliar with </p><p>commercial law, and since unification, conflicting laws </p><p>remain on the books.  Courts are burdened with large </p><p>caseloads and, often, a case may take years to be heard and </p><p>then stagnates in the appellate process.   If a commercial </p><p>ruling is won, it is rarely enforced.  Without a clear land- </p><p>titling system, limited ability to collateralize against </p><p>property, and courts\' reluctance to enforce default </p><p>judgments against property collateral, domestic investors </p><p>are also reluctant to invest their money into new </p><p>businesses. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: </p><p> </p><p>The MEPI strategy for trade assistance will work to enhance </p><p>the export climate and to reform commercial law to establish </p><p>the appropriate export and investment environment in Yemen. </p><p>MEPI goals will be coordinated with and assist in Yemen\'s </p><p>active participation in the proposed U.S.-Middle East Free </p><p>Trade Area.  Embassy Sanaa will also integrate commercial </p><p>law reform with the MidEast Regional Judicial Reform Program </p><p>and subsequent follow-up activities. Embassy Sanaa seeks </p><p>MEPI funding to: </p><p> </p><p>1. Enhance the Export Climate </p><p>     -- Identify trade opportunities.  Targeted research in </p><p>     selected sectors will identify opportunities to expand </p><p>     exports and increase investment in new businesses </p><p>     -- Develop the country\'s overall export potential </p><p>     through an improved legal, regulatory, and </p><p>     institutional environment for international trade </p><p>     -- Improve the quality of data needed for expanded </p><p>     trade and investment </p><p>     -- Provide exporters with the training and technical </p><p>     expertise required to meet international standards </p><p>     -- Support selected elements of the WTO Integrated </p><p>     Framework </p><p>     -- Increase economic growth and jobs </p><p> </p><p>2.  Reform Commercial law </p><p> </p><p>     -- Train judges and lawyers in commercial law </p><p>     -- Embark on a program to deconflict old laws remaining </p><p>     on the books since unification </p><p>     -- Expand existing alternative dispute resolution </p><p>     mechanisms to lessen reliance on the over burdened </p><p>     court system </p><p>     -- Develop programs to train ROYG courts to enforce </p><p>     commercial rulings </p><p>     -- Identify participants for the Mideast Regional </p><p>     Judicial Reform Program </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p> </p><p>Export Climate: </p><p> </p><p>     -- New trade opportunities identified </p><p>     -- Expanded investment in export sectors </p><p>     -- Improved legal and regulatory environment </p><p>     -- Increased international, regional and internal </p><p>     trade; Enhanced trade links between Yemen and regional </p><p>     trading partners </p><p>     -- Level of non-oil exports increased </p><p>     -- Improved quality and transparency in commercial and </p><p>     population data </p><p>     -- Selected elements of the WTO Integrated Framework </p><p>     supported </p><p>     -- Increased economic growth and jobs at the sub- </p><p>     regional level through increased trade within Yemen </p><p> </p><p>Commercial law: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Increased numbers of judges and lawyers with </p><p>     appropriate commercial training </p><p>     -- Expanded use of alternative dispute resolution, if </p><p>     proven more effective, for commercial cases </p><p>     -- Evidence of enforcement of commercial dispute </p><p>     decisions </p><p> </p><p>2.  Expanding employment and business opportunities at the </p><p>local level </p><p> </p><p>Problem: With unequal access to government, credit and </p><p>markets, the growth in number, size, and productivity of </p><p>small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) stagnated over the </p><p>last decade. Because SMEs comprise 96 percent of the private </p><p>sector, their lack of growth is stalling the Yemen economy </p><p>and helping to increase the poverty level. </p><p> </p><p>The underserved governorates of Marib, Al-Jawf, Shabwa, </p><p>Saada, and Amran, in particular, have vast, unrealized </p><p>potential in the agriculture, mining, and light </p><p>manufacturing sectors. Enterprises cannot take advantage of </p><p>these resources and potential because they lack financial, </p><p>business, and marketing services and know-how. Virtually no </p><p>opportunities exist for entrepreneurs to access capital, to </p><p>expand or start enterprises or to receive business </p><p>development support (e.g. marketing, business planning). </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: </p><p> </p><p>The focus will be placed on providing small and medium-sized </p><p>enterprises with greater and reliable access to sustainable </p><p>financial and business services:  1) Enhance microfinance </p><p>and SME finance institutional development; 2) create SME </p><p>business development services; and, 3) Expand SME </p><p>association development. This program element will pay </p><p>particular attention to expanded business and employment </p><p>opportunities for women. </p><p> </p><p>1. Enhance Microfinance and SME Finance Institutional </p><p>Development </p><p> </p><p>     -- Create and enhance institutional entities that are </p><p>     able to offer finance to small lenders in Marib, Al- </p><p>     Jawf, Shabwa, Amran, and Saada Governorates </p><p>2. Create SME Business Development Services (BDS) </p><p>     -- Develop access to non-financial services for micro </p><p>     and small entrepreneurs to receive training and </p><p>     technical assistance, technology transfer, product and </p><p>     services marketing assistance, general management </p><p>     assistance, and business mentoring </p><p> </p><p>3. Expand SME Association Development </p><p> </p><p>     -- Develop associations that integrate producers, </p><p>     processors and vendors into a single organization </p><p>     focused on developing different sub-sectors and </p><p>     enhancing the prospects of economic success </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p> </p><p>     -- SME finance providers developed and offering </p><p>     services in the five target governorates </p><p>     -- SME finance providers reach sustainability (meeting </p><p>     100% of their operational and financial costs) and </p><p>     offer services to capable SMEs </p><p>     -- Technical assistance and training programs for SMEs </p><p>     developed </p><p>     -- Business development services available for specific </p><p>     SME sectors, such as agriculture, food processing, </p><p>     transport, handicraft and tourism, mining, and light </p><p>     manufacturing </p><p>     -- Increase in business linkages between SMEs and </p><p>     economic drivers </p><p>     -- Associations developed, coordinating and networking </p><p>     -- New business opportunities identified </p><p>     -- Increase in income and employment generating- </p><p>     activities </p><p> </p><p>3. Enhancing Policy Reform and Program Development </p><p> </p><p>Problem: Economic development in Yemen is constrained by </p><p>limited institutional support by the ROYG and the private </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p>MEPI Strategy: </p><p> </p><p>To enhance the Republic of Yemen\'s policy reform and program </p><p>development, Embassy Sanaa will seek funding to: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Expand and improve the higher education and research </p><p>     institute systems\' to support economic growth in trade, </p><p>     investment and SMEs </p><p>     -- Expand the ability of the ROYG Ministry of Industry </p><p>     and Trade to produce and share business abstracts and </p><p>     reports </p><p>     -- Develop comprehensive district and governorate </p><p>     economic and development growth plans </p><p>     -- Establish economic development offices and/or </p><p>     authorities at the local level </p><p>     -- Expand business education and training in high </p><p>     schools, community colleges and universities </p><p>     -- Establish public/private sector fora to identify </p><p>     obstacles to expanded business and employment </p><p>     opportunities </p><p> </p><p>Expected Results: </p><p> </p><p>     -- Increased access to information </p><p>     -- Improved laws, regulations and policies </p><p>     -- Economic growth integrated into local level planning </p><p>     -- Increased numbers of Yemenis with business-related </p><p>     skills </p><p>     -- Improved partnerships between the public and private </p><p>     sector </p><p> </p><p>     (END TEXT OF MEPI STRATEGY) </p><p></p></div>
