Therefore, the FonMin\'s message about the </p><p>GOB\'s committment to counternarcotics efforts can be judged </p><p>as having come from the top and is a surprising change from </p><p>the GOB\'s usual tactic of "deny, deny, counter-accuse". End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Taking the opportunity of a remarks before the </p><p>assembled Rangoon diplomatic corps at noon on New Year\'s Eve, </p><p>the Burmese Foreign Minister digressed for ten minutes from </p><p>his set speech to comment on the  GOB\'s desire to prove the </p><p>credibility of its efforts against narcotrafficking. </p><p>Although some of the FonMin\'s stated goals may be </p><p>unattainable ( i.e. reducing opium production in 2003 to 80 </p><p>per cent of the 2002 production), he sent a strong message </p><p>that he would do everything in his power as Vice Chairman of </p><p>the CCDAC  (Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control) to </p><p>maintain momentum in the GOB\'s counternarcotics program. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) He also called for regional assistance and cooperation </p><p>with China, Thailand, Lao, Cambodia and India in combating </p><p>ATS production, particularly with regards to controlling the </p><p>flow of precursor chemicals.  The FonMin steered clear of the </p><p>usual GOB tactic of claiming that Burma was the subject of a </p><p>conspiracy or a smear campaign in regard to its </p><p>counternarcotics efforts, saying instead that he was </p><p>"ashamed" to see his country named in the international press </p><p>as a major source of drugs. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The FonMin also called the situation of the farmers </p><p>who are participating in opium substitution projects </p><p>"tragic".  He said that the GOB knew it was the farmers that </p><p>suffered the most and assured the audience that the GOB was </p><p>sending additional food assistance to them to keep them from </p><p>going back into opium production.  He said that the GOB was </p><p>not asking for foreign assistance, but that direct foreign </p><p>assistance to the farmers would be welcome.   He also </p><p>mentioned the GOB\'s agreement with the Wa in which the Wa </p><p>pledged to be out of opium production by 2005, saying </p><p>"pledges were no longer enough", there had to be action and </p><p>concrete proof that they were getting out of narcotrafficking </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) At the luncheon after the speech, the FonMin continued </p><p>to talk about how intent the GOB and he, personally, was, to </p><p>rid the country of opium production and of the importance of </p><p>aiding farmers in crop substitution projects.  He asked the </p><p>COM if the USG would provide assistance with crop yield </p><p>surveys and satellite imaging to assist in eradication </p><p>efforts (hopefully an indication that the next CNC survey </p><p>will not be thrown off track by the probable of </p><p>non-certification of Burma\'s counternarcotics efforts). </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment:  The FonMin has a reputation for being </p><p>non-controversial and it was highly uncharacteristic of  him </p><p>to digress from the standard "roads, bridges and visits" </p><p>speech to speak extemporaneously about the GOB\'s narcotics </p><p>problem.  Although he is not seen as a heavyweight in terms </p><p>of power, he is known as being close to Than Shwe, reportedly </p><p>because he never brings unpleasant news to the Senior General </p><p>and always "follows instructions".  Therefore, the FonMin\'s </p><p>message about the GOB\'s commitment to counternarcotics </p><p>efforts can be judged as having come from the top and is a </p><p>surprising change from the GOB\'s usual tactic of "deny, deny, </p><p>counter-accuse". End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
