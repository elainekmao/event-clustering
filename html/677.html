<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ADANA 0532 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  WHO PAYS THE PKK? </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ETHNIC TURKISH WIFE OF ADANA AMCIT BUSINESSMAN </p><p>INFORMED ADANA POLOFF THAT HER BROTHER, OWNER OF A LARGE </p><p>RESTAURANT NEAR BURSA, WAS KIDNAPPED BY THE PKK AND TOLD TO MAKE </p><p>"FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS."  RELEASED UNHARMED THE NEXT DAY BUT </p><p>AWARE OF THE PKK\'S ABILITY TO EXACT REPRISALS, HE TOLD HIS WIFE </p><p>NOT TO TELL ANYONE, ESPECIALLY THE POLICE, ABOUT THE INCIDENT. </p><p>THE PKK\'S EXTORTION NETWORK NOW SEEMS TO EXTEND TO TURKISH </p><p>NATIONALS WITH FEW, IF ANY, TIES TO THE TROUBLED SOUTHEAST.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AMCIT BUSINESSMAN IN ADANA, WHOSE WIFE IS AN ETHNIC TURK FROM </p><p>THE BURSA AREA OF NORTHWEST TURKEY, HOSTED A SMALL DINNER PARTY </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 8.  HIS WIFE WAS SOBBING AS SHE GREETED POLOFF AT </p><p>THE FRONT DOOR.  SPEAKING IN A LOW VOICE SO THAT THE OTHER GUESTS </p><p>COULD NOT HEAR, SHE SAID THAT HER BROTHER HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY </p><p>THE PKK.  HE OWNS A LARGE SEAFRONT RESTAURANT THAT FACES THE SEA </p><p>OF MARMARA AND HAS A PIER WHERE HIS YACHT AND OTHERS CAN DOCK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE HOSTESS\'S SISTER-IN-LAW HAD JUST CALLED TO PROVIDE THE </p><p>FOLLOWING DETAILS.  ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 7, SHE AND HER </p><p>HUSBAND WERE GETTING INTO THE CAR OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE.  TWO WELL- </p><p>DRESSED MEN APPROACHED THEM.  THEY TOLD HER THEY NEEDED TO SPEAK </p><p>TO HER HUSBAND PRIVATELY AND THAT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM </p><p>PROVIDED THAT SHE DID NOT GO TO THE AUTHORITIES.  THEY THEN PUT </p><p>HER HUSBAND INTO THEIR CAR AND DROVE AWAY.  SHE DID NOT CALL THE </p><p>POLICE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS RETURNED TO HIS HOME UNHARMED.  HE </p><p>HAD BEEN TAKEN BY TWO PKK OPERATIVES, HE SAID, AND DRIVEN TO A </p><p>LOCATION THAT HE COULD NOT (OR WOULD NOT) IDENTIFY.  THEY TOLD </p><p>HIM THAT THEY KNEW HE WAS A RICH MAN AND THAT THEY EXPECTED HIM </p><p>TO MAKE APPROPRIATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PKK.  THEY CAUTIONED HIM </p><p>THAT NO HARM WOULD COME TO HIM OR HIS FAMILY IF HE COOPERATED AND </p><p>IF HE TOLD NO ONE OF THE APPROACH THEY HAD MADE TO HIM. </p><p>OTHERWISE, THEY TOLD HIM, THEY "KNEW WHERE HE LIVED."  HIS WIFE </p><p>DID NOT SAY THAT HE HAD AGREED TO MAKE PAYMENTS, BUT THERE SEEMS </p><p>TO BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT HE DID SO.  HE URGED HIS WIFE TO SAY </p><p>NOTHING ABOUT THE INCIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  PKK EXTORTION HAS BEEN PART OF THE LANDSCAPE IN </p><p>SOUTHEAST TURKEY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.  CONSULATE ADANA REPORTED </p><p>AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 1992 THE LIKELIHOOD THAT BUSINESSMEN AND </p><p>ELECTED OFFICIALS--EVEN MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COALITION\'S TRUE </p><p>PATH PARTY (DYP)--HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTING, IN SOME CASES </p><p>UNWILLINGLY, TO THE ORGANIZATION\'S COFFERS.  PKK COLLECTION </p><p>EFFORTS, AND RETRIBUTION FOR NON-PAYMENT, HAVE BECOME KNOWN IN </p><p>ADANA AS WELL.  A LARGE ADANA LANDOWNER WAS TAKEN FROM HIS HOME </p><p>AND KILLED TWO YEARS AGO, APPARENTLY FOR REFUSING TO PAY THE PKK. </p><p>THE SITUATION OF THE RESTAURANTEUR NEAR BURSA IS A STRONG </p><p>INDICATION THAT THE TENTACLES OF THE PKK NOW EXTEND TO ETHNIC </p><p>TURKS WITH NO TIES EITHER TO THE SOUTHEAST OR TO THE INCREASINGLY </p><p>"KURDIFIED" ADANA-MERSIN REGION.  IF HIS CASE IS NOT AN ISOLATED </p><p>ONE, IT IS YET ANOTHER INDICATION WHY THE PKK SEEMS NOT TO BE </p><p>CONSTRAINED BY A LACK OF FUNDS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>RAPOPORT </p><p></p></div>
