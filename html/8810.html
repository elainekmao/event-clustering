<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001510 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW OF VIETNAM\'S </p><p>--       MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY: A new Prime Ministerial degree in March </p><p>2003 reaffirmed the MFA\'s main diplomatic functions as the </p><p>GVN\'s main foreign affairs agency and also confirmed its </p><p>leadership over Vietnam\'s Border Commission and increasingly </p><p>active Committee for Overseas Vietnamese.  The new decree is </p><p>unlikely to change the substance or style of the MFA\'s work, </p><p>which is divvied up among 28 regional and functional </p><p>departments.  The MFA continues to attract some of the </p><p>brightest young Vietnamese students.  MFA careers tend to be </p><p>devoted to a single country and/or specialty.  The Americas </p><p>Department is notably strong, with most officials having </p><p>served and/or studied in the U.S.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>NEW LEGAL FRAMEWORK </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Prime Ministerial Decree 21, issued March 10, </p><p>confirmed the MFA\'s lead role as the GVN\'s main foreign </p><p>affairs agency and identified its specific tasks.  It </p><p>updated and formalized a similar Decree 82 from November 10, </p><p>1993 on the MFA\'s tasks and responsibilities.  According to </p><p>this revised legal framework, the MFA -- under the </p><p>leadership of the Government and Prime Minister -- has </p><p>explicit duties, inter alia, to: </p><p>-- establish or guide diplomatic and consular relations with </p><p>other countries and international organizations; </p><p>-- represent the nation and conduct diplomatic relations; </p><p>-- manage representative activities in foreign countries and </p><p>with international organizations, including the UN and </p><p>others, according to international law; </p><p>-- make arrangement for high level official visits overseas </p><p>as well as receiving high-level foreign visitors; </p><p>-- arrange conferences and seminars on international </p><p>affairs; </p><p>-- express the official viewpoints and positions of Vietnam </p><p>on international issues; </p><p>-- monitor foreign press reports regarding Vietnam; </p><p>-- oversee the activities of foreign reporters in Vietnam; </p><p>and, </p><p>-- protect the interests of the nation and the interests and </p><p>rights of Vietnamese organizations and citizens overseas </p><p>according to Vietnamese and international law. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Decree 21 also ratified some new responsibilities </p><p>and organizational changes that had been quietly introduced </p><p>over the past decade, most notably oversight over Vietnam\'s </p><p>Border Commission and its Committee on Overseas Vietnamese. </p><p>(These slipped under MFA control in October 2001 and </p><p>November 1995, respectively.)   Both organizations have had </p><p>more public roles in the past several years due to ongoing </p><p>negotiations with both the PRC and Cambodia on border </p><p>issues, and as the GVN increasingly reaches out to the Viet </p><p>Kieu population, most recently during the U.S. visit of </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Binh Din, who is also head of </p><p>the latter Committee. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  According to Vu Thi Tinh, an expert in the MFA\'s </p><p>Department for Organization and Personnel, Decree 21 should </p><p>be viewed as part of the GVN\'s "administrative reform master </p><p>plan," but should have little practical impact on the day-to- </p><p>day functioning of the MFA.  Tinh noted several key points </p><p>in the decree: </p><p>--Previously, a minister-equivalent had headed the Border </p><p>Commission but now a deputy minister, Le Cong Phung, </p><p>oversees its work; and, </p><p>-- Decree 21 created a new entity, the Center for External </p><p>Economic Information and Informatics.  Previously, this had </p><p>existed as an office within the Department for Economic </p><p>Affairs.  Tinh said that the GVN decided to separate out </p><p>this Center because MFA diplomatic activities "are more and </p><p>more focused on economic cooperation and require more modern </p><p>communications efforts." </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>STRUCTURE </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Administratively, the MFA is broken down into 28 </p><p>units, largely on regional or functional specialties. </p><p>The regional Departments, each headed by a Director General </p><p>and usually supported by 2-3 Deputy Directors General, </p><p>include: </p><p>-- Americas: covering the U.S., Canada, Central and South </p><p>Americas (its Director General has the concurrent title of </p><p>Assistant Foreign Minister).  One of its DDGs concurrently </p><p>serves as the head of the inter-agency "Vietnam Office for </p><p>Seeking Missing Personnel," which is our key interlocutor on </p><p>all POW/MIA issues; </p><p>-- West Asia - Africa: responsible for about 70 countries-- </p><p>including Iraq -- although the GVN is without diplomatic </p><p>presence in most of these; </p><p>-- ASEAN:  handling all ASEAN affairs and meetings -- </p><p>including the ARF and PMC -- but not bilateral relations; </p><p>-- Asia I:  supervising ties with the PRC, Taiwan, the </p><p>Koreas, Japan, and Mongolia; </p><p>-- Asia II:  overseeing relations with Australia, New </p><p>Zealand, Laos, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, </p><p>Thailand, Singapore, Burma, Cambodia, and South Asia; </p><p>-- Europe I:  maintaining relations with Russia, the former </p><p>Soviet republics, Eastern Europe, and Yugoslavia; and, </p><p>-- Europe II:  promoting ties with Western, Northern, and </p><p>Southern Europe. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Functional components, also usually headed by DGs, </p><p>consist of: </p><p>-- Department for External Policies (sometimes called the </p><p>Policy Planning Department), which performs analyses and </p><p>provides advice to help the MFA\'s leadership, similar to S/P </p><p>and/or INR; </p><p>-- Department for Economic Affairs, which collects and </p><p>analyzes information concerning the world economics and </p><p>develops economic policy proposals; </p><p>-- Department for Multilateral Economic Cooperation, which </p><p>provides analyses and advice on policies concerning </p><p>international economic integration.  This department also </p><p>takes the lead on APEC issues, while the Ministry of Trade, </p><p>with MFA participation, handles WTO issues; </p><p>-- Department for International Laws and Treaties, which </p><p>provides advice on legal matters concerning Vietnam\'s </p><p>treaties and relations with other countries and </p><p>international organizations, including the signing of </p><p>international conventions (and is our interlocutor on </p><p>counter-terrorism conventions, the ICOC, and the ICC); </p><p>-- International Organizations, responsible for Vietnam\'s </p><p>participation in more than 60 international organizations, </p><p>as well as handling all of our human rights inquiries.  The </p><p>IO Department is also our interlocutor on the long-standing </p><p>negotiations over a Counter-narcotics agreement; </p><p>-- Department for Protocol; </p><p>-- Department for Culture - UNESCO, which provides advice on </p><p>policies in cultural cooperation and relations with </p><p>different countries and with UNESCO; </p><p>-- Department for Information and Press, which acts as the </p><p>MFA\'s spokesperson and provides press advice concerning </p><p>Vietnam\'s foreign policy.  It also deals with resident </p><p>foreign press members, issuing their visas and press </p><p>credentials as well as requests for meetings and travel; </p><p>-- Center for Foreign Press Service, which provides </p><p>assistance to visiting foreign journalists.  The center can </p><p>arrange appointments, set up interviews and provides </p><p>assistants/interpreters; </p><p>-- Department for Organization and Personnel, the equivalent </p><p>of State\'s Bureau of Human Resources; </p><p>-- Department for Administration and Accountancy, </p><p>responsible for the MFA\'s finances in Vietnam and overseas; </p><p>-- Department for Consular Affairs, which manages consular </p><p>relations, including our ongoing bilateral discussions on a </p><p>protocol on adoptions.  This Department also handled the </p><p>2001/2 Montagnard issues, including negotiations with UNHCR </p><p>and Cambodia on the short-lived Tripartite Agreement, given </p><p>its responsibility for Vietnamese citizens.  In addition, </p><p>this department, after receiving notification and </p><p>documentation from the Protocol Department, issues visas to </p><p>foreign diplomatic personnel; </p><p>-- the Inspectorate, the MFA\'s internal auditor.  It also </p><p>deals with concerned letters of complaints and denunciation </p><p>within its diplomatic community in and outside the country; </p><p>-- the Executive Office, which coordinates the MFA\'s </p><p>contacts with other ministries as well as diplomatic </p><p>missions overseas; </p><p>-- Committee for Overseas Vietnamese; </p><p>-- Border Commission; </p><p>-- Diplomatic Service of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), which </p><p>handles the work of foreign consulates general there, </p><p>including requests for meetings and travel; </p><p>-- Institute for International Relations, a rough equivalent </p><p>of NFTAC, although it also offers undergraduate degrees for </p><p>would-be diplomats and others interested in international </p><p>affairs; </p><p>-- International Affairs Weekly, the MFA\'s official journal; </p><p>-- Center for External Economic Information and Infomatics, </p><p>which serves as a link for domestic economic organizations </p><p>and foreign counterparts.  In addition, the Center manages </p><p>computer resources for the MFA; and, </p><p>-- Department for Diplomatic Service Corps, which provides </p><p>such services as housing and employment of local staff for </p><p>the diplomatic community (although its role has diminished </p><p>dramatically as most missions nowadays are able directly to </p><p>hire and to secure housing).  The MFA also runs its own car </p><p>rental agency, to handle the needs of visiting delegations. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>ASSIGNMENT PROCESS AND PRACTICES </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The MFA\'s Department for Organization and Personnel </p><p>is responsible for MFA assignments, both domestic and </p><p>foreign.  Concerning foreign assignments, Huu Quoc Chinh, an </p><p>expert in that department, said that the MFA\'s senior </p><p>leadership gives this issue "a great deal of attention."  An </p><p>MFA internal committee, chaired by the Department for </p><p>Organization and Personnel, reviews applications for </p><p>assignments on behalf of the foreign minister or one of his </p><p>deputies.  According to Chinh, MFA officials are normally </p><p>assigned only to the countries covered by the departments in </p><p>which they are currently serving.  This provides "more </p><p>continuity and expertise," Chinh claimed.  No one may be </p><p>assigned overseas until he/she is beyond the MFA\'s </p><p>probationary period of three to five years.  However, in </p><p>some "special" cases, the person can apply after one year, </p><p>Chinh noted.  Personnel from functional departments, </p><p>however, have somewhat greater leeway in their overseas </p><p>assignments, however. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Separately, Tran Viet Tu, senior expert in the West </p><p>Asia - Africa Department, pointed out that the GVN views the </p><p>background and training in an individual closely before </p><p>deciding on an overseas assignment.  Similar to the Chinese </p><p>system, he noted, Vietnamese diplomats tend to specialize in </p><p>one area, building up an expertise in a language as well as </p><p>political and cultural issues.  Tu noted that, in his case, </p><p>"it is unlikely" he would ever be assigned outside the Arab </p><p>world, since he has the language and experience in that </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  The MFA continues to attract among the GVN\'s most </p><p>talented and (not surprisingly) internationally savvy </p><p>cadres, even in this era of growing private sector </p><p>opportunities for the best and the brightest.  Many are </p><p>second generation diplomats, including most recently the son </p><p>of former Ambassador to the U.S. and now Deputy Foreign </p><p>Minister Le Van Bang (who has now sought reassignment from </p><p>the ASEAN Department to the Americas Department).  President </p><p>Tran Duc Luong\'s son is also an MFA official. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Our experience with the Americas Department in </p><p>particular has been very good.  Its North American division </p><p>and US/Vietnam division staff appears among the most </p><p>impressive within the MFA.  Most (apart from AFM and DG </p><p>Nguyen Duc Hung) have served previously and/or studied at </p><p>the graduate level in the United States, and understand our </p><p>culture and political system well.  They likely sometimes </p><p>find themselves in the uncomfortable position of having to </p><p>deliver a demarche that they know may well be counter- </p><p>productive when dealing with us.  The strident official </p><p>reactions to irritants like the Vietnam Human Rights Act and </p><p>catfish dumping cases likely originate from the senior </p><p>leadership and/or the Party\'s Commission on External </p><p>Relations, where the levels of expertise on the U.S. are </p><p>less strong and where ideology plays a more central role. </p><p>In such cases, the advice of the more knowledgeable Americas </p><p>staff may not count heavily enough, unfortunately. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
