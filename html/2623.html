<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000678 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, PDAS BELLAMY; ALSO FOR AF/S </p><p> </p><p>PRETORIA PLEASE PASS A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/04 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMONWEALTH OBSERVER GROUP GIVES </p><p>         THUMBS-DOWN ON ZIMBABWEAN ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM REWHITEHEAD DUE TO 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HARARE 665 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) AFTER A ONE-HOUR DELAY, COMMONWEALTH OBSERVER </p><p>GROUP (COG) HEAD OF MISSION ABDULSALAMI ABUBAKAR READ TO </p><p>THE ASSEMBLED PRESS AND DIPLOMATIC CORPS IN INTERIM </p><p>STATEMENT ON THE ZIMBABWEAN ELECTION THAT WAS SHORT BUT </p><p>CERTAINLY NOT SWEET TO GOZ EARS.  ABUBAKAR REMARKED ON </p><p>THE COMMONWEALTH\'S ENGAGEMENT IN TRYING TO RESOLVE TO </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN "CRISIS" SINCE ABUJA AND SAID THAT THE </p><p>COG TERMS OF REFERENCE REQUIRED THAT IT PRONOUNCE ON THE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS AND WHETHER OR NOT THE ELECTION </p><p>ALLOWED THE FREE EXPRESSION OF THE VOTERS\' WILL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ON THE FIRST POINT, HE SAID THAT COG HAD BEEN </p><p>DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THE DETERMINATION OF ZIMBABWEANS TO </p><p>EXERCISE THEIR DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS UNDER "DIFFICULT </p><p>CONDITIONS."  HE CONTINUED THAT A HIGH LEVEL OF </p><p>POLITICALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE MARRED THE PRE-ELECTION </p><p>PERIOD, MOST OF IT PERPETRATED BY SUPPORTERS/MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE RULING PARTY AGAINST SUPPORTERS/MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION.  HE SPECIFICALLY CITED YOUTH MILITIA </p><p>ORGANIZED BY THE GOZ OSTENSIBLY AS A TRAINING PROGRAM </p><p>THAT HAD CARRIED OUT A "SYSTEMATIC CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>INTIMIDATION AGAINST THE MDC."  THIS HAD CREATED A </p><p>"CLIMATE OF FEAR AND SUSPICION." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ABUBAKAR SAID THAT POLICE HAD NOT TAKEN ACTION </p><p>AGAINST OR INVESTIGATED INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE AND BEEN </p><p>"HIGH-HANDED" WITH THE MDC AND "LENIENT" TO ZANU-PF. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00678  141252Z </p><p>THIS HAD ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE RULE OF LAW IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) HE NEXT STATED THAT THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK </p><p>FOR THE ELECTION WAS BASICALLY FLAWED.  THE PUBLIC </p><p>OORDER AND SECURITY ACT IN PARTICULAR HAD PREVENTED FREE </p><p>MOVEMENT AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND HAD NOT ALLOWED THE </p><p>OPPOSITION TO CAMPAIGN.  THE STATEMENT CITED OTHER </p><p>REGULATIONS HAD KEPT CIVIL SOCIETY FROM PLAYING ITS </p><p>NORMAL ROLE, INCLUDING UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS THAT </p><p>PREVENTED DEPLOYMENT OF DOMESTIC OBSERVERS.  THERE WAS A </p><p>LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE REGISTRATION PROCESS.  THE </p><p>STATEMENT CRITICIZED THE WIDE DISCRETION GIVEN THE </p><p>REGISTRAR GENERAL AND SAID THAT THE INCUMBENT PARTY HAD </p><p>USED STATE RESOURCES FOR ITS CAMPAIGN, IN PARTICULAR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S NEAR MONOPOLY ON THE BROADCAST MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE STATEMENT CONTINUED THAT MANY COULD NOT VOTE </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION OF POLLING STATIONS IN URBAN </p><p>AREAS.  SUCH A PHENOMENON DID NOT EXIST IN RURAL AREAS. </p><p>ABUBAKAR CITED "INEXPLICABLE" DELAYS IN HONORING A HIGH </p><p>COURT RULING TO OPEN POLLING STATION FOR A THIRD DAY OF </p><p>VOTING IN HARARE AND CHITUNGWIZA.  THE REPORT CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT "CONDITIONS IN ZIMBABWE DID NOT ADEQUATELY ALLOW </p><p>FREE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF THE ELECTORS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE AUSTRALIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER AND AN </p><p>AUSTRALIAN MEMBER OF COG TOLD US THAT THE HARD-HITTING </p><p>STATEMENT HAD BEEN THE FOCUS OF INTENSE WRANGLING, WITH </p><p>NAMIBIAN AND KENYAN DELEGATES (AND TO A LESSER DEGREE </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICANS) ALIGNED AGAINST ALL OTHER MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE DELEGATION, INCLUDING OTHER AFRICANS.  THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00678  141252Z </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO DELETE LANGUAGE CRITICAL OF THE GOZ FAILED </p><p>WHEN THE OTHERS THREATENED TO BRING THE ISSUE TO A VOTE </p><p>AND FORCE THEM TO WALK OUT.  THE AUSTRALIAN OBSERVER </p><p>SAID THAT HE DID NOT THINK THAT IT HAD ULTIMATELY COME </p><p>TO THAT, BUT THAT CONSENSUS WAS BY NO MEANS UNIVERSAL. </p><p>HE ADDED THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EVEN MORE BRUISING </p><p>STRUGGLE OVER THE DRAFT OF THE FINAL REPORT, WHICH WILL </p><p>CONTAIN A RECOMMENDATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT ZIMBABWE </p><p>SHOULD BE SUSPENDED FROM THE COMMONWEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT.  DESPITE ITS INTERNAL RIFTS, THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH HAS JOINED RANKS WITH SADC-PF AND THE </p><p>NORWEGIANS IN PUBLICLY CONDEMNING THE CONDITIONS UNDER </p><p>WHICH THE ELECTION TOOK PLACE (REFTEL), AND BY EXTENSION </p><p>CALLING INTO QUESTION ITS LEGITIMACY.  THIS OUTCOME </p><p>GENERATED CONSIDERABLE EMOTION.  THE AUSTRALIAN OBSERVER </p><p>FUMED THAT HE FOUND IT INCONCEIVABLE THAT SOME OF THE </p><p>AFRICAN OBSERVERS WOULD ARGUE THAT AFRICAN ELECTIONS </p><p>SHOULD BE JUDGED BY MORE LENIENT STANDARDS THAN </p><p>ELECTIONS HELD ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
