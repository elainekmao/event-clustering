<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 KUWAIT 000544 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/M, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, IIP/G/NEA- </p><p>SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, FEBRUARY 3-10: WAR AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ; TERRORISM IN KUWAIT; US PRESENCE IN KUWAIT; SPACE </p><p>SHUTTLE COLUMBIA; TRAVEL WARNING; REPATRIATION CASE. </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Support for US-led action against Iraq is strong </p><p>despite being alloyed with rhetorical angst over Israel and </p><p>other issues. The US presence in Kuwait is seen as necessary </p><p>even after Saddam is removed, but one commentator also </p><p>expresses embarrassment that "Kuwaiti soldiers are playing </p><p>cards and drinking tea" while US troops prepare to defend </p><p>Kuwait again. </p><p> </p><p>The space shuttle accident was politicized, with one writer </p><p>chastising those who would gloat over it as revenge for US </p><p>Middle East policy. Among the gloaters: a commentator who </p><p>gleefully hopes that the association of Palestine, Texas </p><p>will remind the West of the daily tragedy of "the other </p><p>Palestine." </p><p> </p><p>Commentary on the repatriation of an American citizen </p><p>teenager who also holds a Kuwaiti passport appears again, </p><p>with the US Embassy accused of "bearing the greatest </p><p>responsibility" for the violation of the Kuwaiti father\'s </p><p>parental rights. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Al-Rai Al-Aam reported that the GOK is leaning towards </p><p>imposing martial law. If implemented, the National Assembly </p><p>would remain in session, and the government would commit </p><p>itself "not to abuse its power." The Kuwait Lawyers </p><p>Association opposes martial law, while former MP, Ali Al- </p><p>Baghli, supports it "so that our American friends will not </p><p>be vulnerable to enemies and Kuwaitis who support Al-Qaeda." </p><p>The government will also seek National Assembly approval for </p><p>a three-month temporary law allowing the government to hold </p><p>suspects for 15 days instead of 4, if there is war against </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Sabah </p><p>Al-Ahmed, denied allegations that schools would be closed </p><p>after reports that two American schools have extended their </p><p>mid-year break until March 22. President of Kuwait </p><p>University, Dr. Al-Jallal, announced that the university </p><p>would resume classes on February 15 as usual, but would </p><p>issue departure forms for professors who wish to leave. </p><p> </p><p>Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed is reported to have said that gas </p><p>masks are "on the way" and will be available to the public. </p><p>However, he is quoted as saying: "I\'m one of those people </p><p>that won\'t put one on." </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassa reported that the Kuwaiti military asked all </p><p>private sector transportation companies to make their </p><p>vehicles available for military use. The Ministry of Health </p><p>requested that leave for doctors, nurses, and other health </p><p>employees was suspended. </p><p> </p><p>All papers reported that the Kuwaiti military has declared </p><p>two-thirds of Kuwait a restricted military zone starting </p><p>February 15. Ministry of Interior investigation teams have </p><p>reportedly started accompanying American military convoys </p><p>for protection purposes. </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Defense, Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak, told the </p><p>Kuwait News Agency that the GCC Defense Ministers meeting in </p><p>Jeddah agreed to deploy a Peninsula Shield battalion to </p><p>Kuwait to support Kuwaiti military units. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Information Assistant Under-Secretary for </p><p>Foreign Media, Sheikh Mubarak Al-Duaij, in a radio interview </p><p>in Beirut said: "The Kuwaiti government plans to build camps </p><p>outside the border for Iraqi refugees. The Iraqi people and </p><p>the Kuwait people are twins." It is reported that 2100 tents </p><p>have been sent to the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border to be used by </p><p>refugees and American forces. </p><p> </p><p>All papers reported Iraqi Prime Minister Tariq Aziz\'s </p><p>retraction that in case of an armed conflict, Iraq "does not </p><p>intend to attack Kuwait, but rather American forces in </p><p>Kuwait." Elsewhere, Iraqi Vice President Ramadan threatened </p><p>suicide attacks inside Iraq and abroad, specifically naming </p><p>Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. </p><p> </p><p>National Assembly Speaker, Jassim Al-Khorafi, said in an </p><p>interview with Reuters: "Democracy is a double-edged sword. </p><p>If it is properly used, it is beneficial. If it is not, then </p><p>it leads to chaos." On February 3, a lack of a quorum </p><p>prevented the adjourning of the National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p>A court sentenced four Kuwaitis accused of being members of </p><p>Al-Qaeda to five years in jail. Elsewhere, a Kuwaiti man was </p><p>apprehended after a shotgun, ammunition and over 200 video </p><p>cds showing "jihad" operations in Bosnia and Chechnya were </p><p>found in his vehicle. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassa asked religious and parliamentary figures, "When </p><p>will we see an end to the attacks against U.S. forces in </p><p>Kuwait?" Sample responses: </p><p>--Islamist Kuwait University political science professor, </p><p>Dr. Abdulla Sahar answered that these were individual acts </p><p>that will disappear with the downfall of Saddam\'s regime. </p><p>--Shiite MP, Abdul-Mohsen Yousef Jamal said it is not </p><p>permitted to attack the forces that come to protect us. </p><p>--Director of the Kuwait Center for Strategic Studies, Dr. </p><p>Sami Al-Faraj answered that these are individual acts and do </p><p>not reflect how the Kuwaiti society views the American </p><p>presence here. </p><p> </p><p>All papers carried coverage of a press roundtable discussion </p><p>with Ambassador David Mack, Vice President of the Middle </p><p>East Institute, on the Iraq crisis. </p><p> </p><p>3. "Let Us Share Their Tragedy" </p><p>Dr. Naji Al-Ziad wrote in independent Al-Qabas (2/3):  "I </p><p>was very sorry to hear about the tragic loss of the American </p><p>astronauts and the space shuttle. Unfortunately, some </p><p>believe that America-- the enemy of Islam and of Muslims, as </p><p>they perceive it-- deserves such a punishment. . The death </p><p>of astronauts in the interest of science should not be a </p><p>chance to take revenge. We have to stand side by side with </p><p>them, just as they stood with us during our crisis in 1990." </p><p> </p><p>4. "A Message to the American Ambassador" </p><p>Qais Al-Ustta wrote in independent Al-Qabas (2/3):  "Many </p><p>Kuwaitis have good relations with the American Ambassador to </p><p>Kuwait, Richard Jones. The Ambassador realizes that 99% of </p><p>Kuwaitis consider America a friend to Kuwait. On the other </p><p>hand, American citizens and the American government believe </p><p>that attacks on American soldiers have increased, and that </p><p>puts the Ambassador in between. I write to you as a humble </p><p>citizen to tell you that your presence in Kuwait is </p><p>something we welcome, and to stress to you that Kuwait will </p><p>remain a safe haven for our American friends." </p><p> </p><p>5. "America is at its Best" </p><p>Osam Safar wrote in independent Al-Qabas (2/3): "Those who </p><p>believe that the American role [in the Middle East] will end </p><p>after a new Iraqi government is established are mistaken. </p><p>Frankly, the need for a powerful nation such as the US will </p><p>not end, and we will not encourage them to leave Kuwait. </p><p>until another powerful nation like the US emerges." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The American Palestine" </p><p>Islamist Adel Al-Qassar wrote in independent Al-Qabas (2/4): </p><p>"The destiny of the Israeli space astronaut Iian Ramon ended </p><p>in a small town called Palestine in Texas. We hope that the </p><p>West would remember the Eastern Palestine and the massacres </p><p>that Israel commits against the Palestinian people. We also </p><p>wish the Western Palestine would realize the tragedies of </p><p>the Arab Palestine. We also hope that the US will give more </p><p>Arab names to its regions." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Before the Strike Begins" </p><p>Waleed Al-Ahmad wrote in independent Al-Anba (2/3): "We know </p><p>that at one time Saddam Hussein served the interests of the </p><p>US, but now, Saddam has become useless. We also fully </p><p>realize that the current situation has benefited Israel. </p><p>which seems to be at the peak of its joy because the Iraqi </p><p>crisis has diverted the attention of the world away from the </p><p>terrorist acts perpetrated by Israel against the </p><p>Palestinians. We also realize it is useless to call on the </p><p>Arab world to solve the crisis. Therefore, we must support </p><p>US efforts to oust Saddam\'s regime." </p><p> </p><p>8. Independent Al-Qabas published (2/5) an interview with </p><p>Dr. Ahmad Al-Baghdadi, liberal Political Science professor </p><p>at Kuwait University, as part of a series of interviews with </p><p>prominent Kuwaiti figures discussing extremism in Kuwait: </p><p>"When I ask for the closure of the Faculty of Sharia, this </p><p>does not mean that I am calling for the elimination of </p><p>religious education for children and youths. I want this </p><p>education to continue in the mainstream system so that those </p><p>extremists will not have the chance to join such </p><p>institutions and teach our children this extremism. </p><p>[T]raditional Salafi thinking distinguishes between the </p><p>infidel from the believer as the latter having the right to </p><p>everything and the former to nothing in the land of Islam. </p><p>Therefore, any kind of support to the infidels-- and here we </p><p>talking directly about the question of American military </p><p>presence in Kuwait and the [Arabian] Peninsula-- would not </p><p>be acceptable." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "An Open Letter to President Bush" </p><p>Noriyah Al-Sadani wrote in Independent Al-Rai Al-A\'am (2/8): </p><p>"Your authorization for your citizens to leave Kuwait has </p><p>made us fearful of what will happen, and what kind of new </p><p>weapons will be used. What precautions have you taken for </p><p>the safety of our homeland and those living in Kuwait? . I </p><p>pray for the safety of your officers and soldiers who are </p><p>present in Kuwait, and for the safety of all people in </p><p>Kuwait. The noble objective of this war is to remove Saddam. </p><p>but what happens after that?" </p><p> </p><p>10. Mohammad Musaid Al-Saleh wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(2/9):  "A friend of mine informed me that while driving </p><p>recently to his farm, he passed American and British </p><p>military vehicles heading to locations to defend Kuwait. </p><p>Later, my friend saw some Kuwait soldiers playing cards and </p><p>drinking tea. My friend is wondering if it is reasonable for </p><p>the Americans and the British to do their duties while the </p><p>Kuwaitis are playing cards and drinking tea? We should not </p><p>ask for the help of foreign soldiers when Kuwait is in </p><p>danger. Kuwaitis must defend their country. Foreign powers </p><p>are not willing to defend us every time Kuwait is in </p><p>danger." </p><p> </p><p>11. "The Tragedy of a Father and his Daughter: Who is </p><p>Responsible?" </p><p>Mallallah Yousef Mallallah wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(2/9):  "The Ministry of Education, the Ministry of </p><p>Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of </p><p>Communication and the American Embassy in Kuwait were all </p><p>involved in the kidnapping of a Kuwaiti child from Kuwait </p><p>and transporting her to the US. The Embassy of a great and </p><p>powerful nation should not have got involved in this case </p><p>because there are legal, diplomatic and other legitimate </p><p>ways to solve this issue. One would ask, how did the girl </p><p>leave the school and how did she go to the American Embassy? </p><p>. Whose responsibility is it at the Ministry of Interior for </p><p>not opening a missing child case at the police station? How </p><p>could the Ministry of Foreign Affairs participate in the </p><p>kidnapping of a Kuwaiti citizen? Why did the country ignore </p><p>the basic constitutional rights of a Kuwaiti citizen? The </p><p>Ministry of Communication is also responsible in this case </p><p>because it controls the borders.  The American Embassy bears </p><p>the greatest responsibility for the father and the daughter. </p><p>Why didn\'t they find another way to solve this case? What </p><p>about the fate of the innocent child? . If any citizen has </p><p>any problem, he usually asks for the help of the government </p><p>and its institutions, but what does he do if the government </p><p>is involved in the crime? I personally know the honesty of </p><p>Mr. Al-Saffar and I call on him to try all legal and </p><p>legitimate ways to solve his case, because if we keep silent </p><p>about his case, then we will not feel safe and secure in our </p><p>own country." </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
