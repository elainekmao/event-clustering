<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001564 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ANZ SUES INFORMATION MINISTER MOYO; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   We have a classic case here in which the prey has </p><p>      become the predator.  Upset by "highly defamatory and </p><p>      malicious attacks" by Information and Publicity Minister </p><p>      Jonathan Moyo, the independent Associated Newspapers of </p><p>      Zimbabwe (ANZ) - publishers of the "Daily News" and its </p><p>      sister weekly the "Daily News On Sunday" - has filed a Z$58 </p><p>      million defamation suit against the minister, including the </p><p>      state-owned Zimbabwe Newspapers (ZIMPAERS) group - </p><p>      publishers of "The Herald" and six other titles - and </p><p>      Nathaniel Manheru, a columnist for ZIMPAPERS\' flagship "The </p><p>      Herald" newspaper.  According to an article carried in the </p><p>      August 5 edition of the independent daily "The Daily News," </p><p>      under headline "ANZ files $58m defamation suit against </p><p>      Moyo, Herald," ANZ secretary and chief legal advisor </p><p>      Gugulethu Moyo is reported to have instructed ANZ lawyers </p><p>      to issue summons against Moyo in his personal capacity. </p><p>      ANZ is suing Moyo over various statements he allegedly made </p><p>      in the state media attacking and bringing into question the </p><p>      integrity of the ANZ newspapers and their editorial staff. </p><p>2.   Among the offending stories cited in the summons is an </p><p>article carried in the May 17 edition of "The Herald."  In </p><p>the article, Moyo is alleged to have attacked "The Daily </p><p>News," its staff and the ANZ Group non-executive chairman </p><p>Strive Masiyiwa over a story about a plan proposed by the </p><p>international community to help lift Zimbabwe out of the </p><p>current economic crisis.  Another defamatory article cited </p><p>in the summons appeared in "The Herald" of June 10, in </p><p>which Information Minister Moyo is quoted "accusing </p><p>Masiyiwa of using `The Daily News\' to destabilize Zimbabwe" </p><p>and also harboring presidential ambitions.  In the June 14 </p><p>edition of "The Herald", Manheru allegedly wrote and </p><p>ZIMPAPERS published and distributed an article suggesting </p><p>that Masiyiwa owned and ran a newspaper "to advance his </p><p>personal interests in opposition politics."  According to </p><p>an unnamed official, ANZ has "more than 300 articles in </p><p>which he (Moyo) has made statements which were untrue, </p><p>defamatory and highly prejudicial to the newspaper group." </p><p>Information and Publicity Minister Jonathan Moyo is yet to </p><p>file his papers at court responding to the ANZ suit against </p><p>him. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
