<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000604 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NAC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Coverage of Iraq war raises </p><p>      questions" the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald" dedicated its March 25 editorial to urging </p><p>      journalists, especially those from the electronic </p><p>      media, covering the United States-led war against Iraq </p><p>      to be impartial.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The Americans were very angry about the </p><p>      showing of the U.S. POWs on the world\'s television </p><p>      screens, although quiet about live footage of Iraqis </p><p>      actually surrendering and not quite being POWs until </p><p>      that surrender had been officially accepted.  So while </p><p>      technically the American journalists were just legal </p><p>      while the Iraqi authorities were in breach of the </p><p>      Geneva conventions, the tiny difference is immaterial </p><p>      to those who were photographed. </p><p> </p><p>      ".It has already become obvious that the U.S. </p><p>     and British television coverage of the invasion </p><p>     of Iraq is far more one-sided than most editors </p><p>     of those television networks would desire.  It </p><p>     has also been noticeable that the written </p><p>     reportage from the great news agencies, both </p><p>     those based in `coalition\' countries and those </p><p>     outside, has been far more analytical and made </p><p>     far more effort to try and see the larger story." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
