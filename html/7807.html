<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002616 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR TSA FOR FRANK HARRIS </p><p>ATHENS FOR TSAR MONTGOMERY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ASEC, PTER, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI "SOUVENIR" CAUSE OF FATAL EXPLOSION AT </p><p>JORDANIAN AIRPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: An explosive device apparently picked up </p><p>in Iraq as a souvenir by a Japanese photo-journalist </p><p>detonated at Queen Alia International Airport during </p><p>examination by a security guard May 1, killing the guard and </p><p>injuring five others.  The photographer remains incarcerated </p><p>by Jordanian officials, but is expected to be released to the </p><p>custody of Japanese government officials after further </p><p>interrogation.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>DEADLY SOUVENIR </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Queen Alia International Airport Director Nasri </p><p>Nowar told us that at approximately 6:30 p.m. Thursday, May </p><p>1, a security guard at the airport noticed a </p><p>"suspicious-looking device" during an initial screening of </p><p>the luggage of a Japanese photo-journalist en route to Tokyo </p><p>via Cairo.  Nowar said the guard had moved the luggage to an </p><p>"isolated" table for further inspection, and was in the </p><p>process of examining the device when it exploded in his </p><p>hands, killing him immediately and injuring five others </p><p>standing by.  The explosion also touched off some panic among </p><p>passengers and airport staff who thought the airport was </p><p>under attack, according to Nasri, but airport police quickly </p><p>restored calm.  The terminal was closed for four hours </p><p>pending maintenance and investigation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Nowar said the photographer, Hiroki Gomi, a </p><p>passenger on an Egyptair flight to Cairo, told police that he </p><p>picked up the device in Baghdad in mid-April as a "souvenir" </p><p>from the war, but had "no idea" it was a type of munition. </p><p>Gomi also told police he had given a similar souvenir to a </p><p>friend from Amman, which police were dispatched to retrieve </p><p>upon Gomi\'s disclosure.  Nowar said that preliminary findings </p><p>indicated the devices were bomblets from cluster bombs, but </p><p>added that the investigation was ongoing. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) While Gomi could be charged with negligent homicide </p><p>under Jordanian law, Nowar said that it was more likely he </p><p>would be released to the custody of Japanese government </p><p>officials for deportation following further questioning by </p><p>Jordanian military and intelligence officials, as Jordan "did </p><p>not want to jeopardize the excellent relationship we have </p><p>with Japan."  A representative from Gomi\'s employer, the </p><p>newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, arrived in Jordan over the </p><p>weekend and personally expressed his apologies on behalf of </p><p>the newspaper to the victim\'s coworkers and assured Jordanian </p><p>officials that the victims would be compensated. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Nowar said none of the other injuries appear to be </p><p>life-threatening.  He said another guard and an Egyptian </p><p>passenger remain in the hospital, but may be released </p><p>tomorrow.  The remaining injured, including a guard and two </p><p>airport baggage workers, were treated on the scene and </p><p>released. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) While clearly rattled by what was an incident </p><p>apparently characterized more by stupidity and negligence </p><p>than by criminal intent, Jordanian civair authorities are </p><p>confident the matter was handled properly by airport security </p><p>personnel.  Nonetheless, they are eager to hear from </p><p>Transportation Security Administration officials, due in </p><p>Amman mid-May, their thoughts on the incident, as well as </p><p>possible recommendations for additional safeguards. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
