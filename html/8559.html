<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001263 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, ASEC, MARR, IZ, IR, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM, TERFIN, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S 6/2 MEETING WITH FM QIRBI: U/S BOLTON </p><p>VISIT; JUDICIAL, ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 1170 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge Alan G. Misenheimer for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In a 6/2 meeting with Ambassador, FM Qirbi </p><p>said he looked forward to visiting WDC, possibly with </p><p>Interior Minister Alimi for policy discussions.  He welcomed </p><p>Ambassador\'s readout of the FBI Director\'s meeting with Saleh </p><p>earlier the same day.  Ambassador briefed Qirbi on the </p><p>upcoming visit of U/S Bolton, underscoring the importance of </p><p>positive Yemeni action on Article 98 and cooperation with the </p><p>DPRK.  On terrorist financing, the Ambassador argued that </p><p>Moayed should cooperate with U.S. investigators and urged the </p><p>ROYG to designate a legitimate channel (vice the al-Aqsa </p><p>Foundation) of Yemeni public support for Abu Mazen and the </p><p>PA.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>FBI Director Mueller\'s Visit </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, called on FM Abubaker </p><p>al-Qirbi at his home late in the evening of 6/2.  Qirbi was </p><p>joined by Special Assistant Abdel Karim al-Iryani. </p><p>Ambassador began by providing Qirbi with a detailed readout </p><p>of FBI Director Mueller\'s meeting with President Saleh </p><p>earlier the same day.  Qirbi expressed satisfaction with the </p><p>discussion, noting that law enforcement cooperation with the </p><p>United States would remain a major Yemeni interest for the </p><p>foreseeable future.  Ambassador urged Qirbi to see that Yemen </p><p>is well represented at the upcoming economic forum in Amman </p><p>and the September judicial reform conference in Manama. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Policy Dialogue with the USG </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Qirbi said he had been reflecting on his recent </p><p>discussion with Ambassador about travel to Washington.  In </p><p>the aftermath of both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Yemen\'s </p><p>April parliamentary elections, he said it was "high time" to </p><p>initiate substantive talks with the USG about future </p><p>developments in the region.  He said he wanted to make Yemen </p><p>a positive element in U.S. strategic thinking about the </p><p>region, including both Iraq and Israeli-Palestinian peace </p><p>efforts.  Of particular importance, he said, was U.S. </p><p>cooperation with Yemen and other countries in the region -- </p><p>especially the GCC states -- to build regional security.  The </p><p>time is past, argued Qirbi, when Yemen or any other country </p><p>in this region, can think of its own security to the </p><p>exclusion of broader security in the region.  Qirbi suggested </p><p>that the effort should address Iran as well.  Referring to </p><p>his talks with Iranian officials during the recent OIC </p><p>meeting in Tehran, he reported that the "Iranians think they </p><p>are reaching out to you but you are ignoring them." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The FM commented that it could make sense for him to </p><p>visit Washington together with Interior Minister Alimi, as </p><p>this would provide for a broader base of bilateral </p><p>discussions, including detailed talks on CT cooperation -- </p><p>including U.S. assistance for the Yemeni Coast Guard, which </p><p>falls under Alimi\'s authority. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>U/S Bolton\'s Visit: Article 98; DPRK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador characterized the upcoming visit of U/S </p><p>Bolton (now set for June 16-18) as a golden opportunity for </p><p>the ROYG to reach a successful outcome on Article 98.  He </p><p>briefly reviewed the positive examples set by Jordan, Egypt, </p><p>Kuwait and Bahrain and noted that the Egyptian model -- based </p><p>on a simple exchange of notes -- might readily be adapted for </p><p>Yemen.  Iryani confirmed that Qirbi\'s office had received </p><p>copies of the Egyptian notes from the Embassy earlier in the </p><p>week and were actively studying them.  The Ambassador made a </p><p>strong pitch for Qirbi to take personal ownership of the </p><p>issue for Yemen and work it to conclusion in advance of U/S </p><p>Bolton\'s visit.  Qirbi said he would coordinate with the </p><p>Embassy over coming weeks toward this end. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador also advised the FM that U/S Bolton would </p><p>raise Yemen\'s cooperation with North Korea, a very sensitive </p><p>and important subject for the USG.  Recalling previous </p><p>discussions of the subject, Ambassador urged Qirbi to </p><p>postpone any actions or decisions on further interaction with </p><p>the DPRK -- including planned port improvements -- before </p><p>discussing the issue with U/S Bolton.  He reiterated the </p><p>recommendation that Yemen seek an acceptable alternative, </p><p>perhaps engineering/construction firms from Eastern Europe. </p><p>Qirbi welcomed the advice and said he looked forward to </p><p>successful discussions with U/S Bolton. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Economic Reform Meeting in Amman </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador urged Qirbi to ensure that the ROYG is well </p><p>represented at the upcoming WEF meeting in Amman.  The FM </p><p>acknowledged the importance of the meeting and said Yemen </p><p>would take part. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Judicial Reform Meeting in Manama </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In response to urging that Yemen also attend the </p><p>September Bahrain meeting on judicial reform, Qirbi expressed </p><p>regret at the new Justice Minister\'s decision not to attend a </p><p>judicial reform conference in South Korea.  By September he </p><p>will be well settled in, so Yemen should be well represented </p><p>in Manama.  Qirbi acknowledged that judicial reform, </p><p>especially in the areas of commercial contracts and land </p><p>tenure, was desperately needed in Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Terrorist Financing/Sheikh Moayed </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Qirbi said he was pleased the Moayed case had come up </p><p>in the FBI Director\'s discussions in Aden.  He said the ROYG </p><p>remained deeply concerned over the domestic implications of </p><p>the case and was attempting to mitigate the impact of a </p><p>possible German decision to extradite Moayed to the United </p><p>States.  Many people are convinced he is innocent, said </p><p>Qirbi.  The Ambassador noted Moayed\'s popularity in Sanaa, </p><p>but urged Qirbi to draw attention to the integrity of both </p><p>the German and U.S. legal systems.  Moayed will receive due </p><p>process, and should cooperate with U.S. investigators in </p><p>uncovering the network of terrorist financing in the United </p><p>States, said the Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Ambassador also noted the financing issue as an </p><p>appropriate way for states of the region, including Yemen, to </p><p>show support for President Bush\'s high profile effort to </p><p>foster Israeli-Palestinian peace.  Since the USG had recently </p><p>designated the al-Aqsa Foundation, both in Yemen and </p><p>elsewhere, as a terrorist financing entity, the ROYG should </p><p>now seek not only to shut off any remaining channels of </p><p>monetary support for Palestinian extremist groups but also to </p><p>designate and support a legitimate channel for Yemenis to </p><p>support Abu Mazen and the Palestinian Authority as it embarks </p><p>on a difficult peacemaking effort.  Qirbi said the ROYG would </p><p>follow up accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
