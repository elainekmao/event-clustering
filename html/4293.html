PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, EAID, ECON, EFIN, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMOCRATIC SPACE FURTHER RESTRICTED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) recently </p><p>issued a report unusually critical of the GOZ, detailing a </p><p>chronology of violence during the October by-election in </p><p>Insiza.  ZESN recommends that an Independent Electoral </p><p>Commission be appointed by Parliament to conduct future </p><p>elections to prevent the "democratic space" in Zimbabwe from </p><p>further shrinking.  Like many others working for a more </p><p>democratic Zimbabwe, ZESN is not hopeful of progress in the </p><p>near future.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On October 31, the Zimbabwe Election Support Network </p><p>(ZESN), an association of NGOs, issued an unusually critical </p><p>preliminary report on the by-election held in Insiza October </p><p>26 - 27.  The report blames irregularities squarely on </p><p>ZANU-PF and uses stronger, more condemnatory language than </p><p>ZESN\'s previous election reports.  Included is a chronology </p><p>of vote buying by the ruling party during the run-up to the </p><p>elections, the disruption of MDC rallies by ZANU-PF officials </p><p>giving out food, the shooting of an MDC official by the </p><p>ZANU-PF candidate, the theft of MDC campaign materials by </p><p>ZANU-PF members, the denial of access to the constituency for </p><p>the MDC candidate, and other shootings and attacks on MDC </p><p>members or their homes.  The report complains that the GOZ </p><p>accredited only eight ZESN observers, that many voters were </p><p>turned away at the polling stations, and that voter turnout </p><p>was low amidst a tense environment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ZESN recommends that an Independent Electoral </p><p>Commission, as opposed to the partisan Electoral Supervisory </p><p>Committee (ESC) that now oversees elections, should be </p><p>appointed by Parliament to conduct future elections.  The </p><p>report recommends that GOZ accredit independent observers </p><p>expeditiously, and that the voters\' roll be made available to </p><p>all stakeholders.  And it suggests that polling stations </p><p>should be easily accessible and that food should not be used </p><p>to entice votes. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Chairman of ZESN, Dr. Reginald Matchaba Hove, </p><p>expressed ZESN\'s frustration at the GOZ\'s continued </p><p>willingness to use violence, intimidation and vote buying to </p><p>control an election outcome, security threats against the </p><p>opposition candidate, and the GOZ\'s denial of accreditation </p><p>of 42 ZESN observers.  He said he would meet with the </p><p>Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Elections in a lobbying </p><p>effort to keep the pressure on, but was not hopeful that </p><p>freer elections would result.  Instead, he anticipated that </p><p>the "democratic space" would be further restricted.  He noted </p><p>that distributing food as an integral part of the campaign </p><p>process in near famine conditions could hardly result in a </p><p>democratic outcome.  People in Insiza, he said, had voted for </p><p>food, not their preferred political leadership.  He reported </p><p>that the Grain Marketing Board, (GMB) had already stepped up </p><p>food deliveries in Kuwadzana, the suburb of Harare </p><p>represented by the recently deceased MDC MP Learnmore Jongwe, </p><p>to influence the upcoming by-election there. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ZESN has used more neutral language in past election </p><p>reports to describe irregularities.  In a frustrated tone, </p><p>this report blames the GOZ squarely for hijacking the </p><p>democratic process in what amounts to appointing its </p><p>candidate into office.  Yet, like many others working for a </p><p>more democratic Zimbabwe, Dr. Hove is not hopeful of progress </p><p>in the near future so long as maintaining political power </p><p>remains the predominant objective of the current government. </p><p>We share his view.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
