SUMMARY: THE IWG AND ISC ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO </p><p>INCORPORATE NEW POLICIES AND GUIDANCE INTO THE ICASS </p><p>HANDBOOK.  SINCE THE LAST UPDATING OF THE HANDBOOK IN </p><p>APRIL OF 1998 THERE HAVE BEEN MANY LESSONS LEARNED LEADING </p><p>TO CHANGES AND ADDITIONS TO ICASS POLICIES.  THIS IS THE </p><p>FIRST IN A SERIES OF CABLES HIGHLIGHTING UPDATES TO 6 FAH- </p><p>5 - THE ICASS HANDBOOK. AS WE UPDATE EACH SECTION WE WILL </p><p>BE SENDING OUT A CABLE EXPLAINING THE CHANGES, WHILE AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME INCORPORATING THE CHANGES INTO THE FAH.  THE </p><p>GOAL IS TO COMPLETE UPDATING THE HANDBOOK BY NEXT SPRING. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE "DEVELOPMENT OF STAFFING PATTERN AND POSITION </p><p>SCHEDULES" IS TO NO LONGER BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE </p><p>PERSONNEL SERVICES COST CENTER BUT UNDER THE BASIC PACKAGE </p><p>COST CENTER. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE ACTIVITY "DEVELOPMENT OF STAFFING PATTERN AND </p><p>POSITION SCHEDULES" IS PRESENTLY ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE </p><p>PERSONNEL SERVICES COST CENTER. WITH INPUT FROM THE POSTS </p><p>THE IWG HAS DETERMINED THAT THIS ACTIVITY FITS BETTER </p><p>UNDER THE "BASIC PACKAGE" COST CENTER SINCE ALL AGENCIES </p><p>BENEFIT FROM THIS SERVICE BY VIRTUE OF BEING IN COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>4. PLEASE DELETE THE WORDS "DEVELOPMENT OF STAFFING </p><p>PATTERN AND POSITION SCHEDULES" FROM 6-FAH-5 H-405.1-10. </p><p>THE TEXT WILL NOW READ:  "(A) U.S. CITIZEN EMPLOYEE </p><p>PERSONNEL SERVICES - A.DESCRIPTION. PROCESSING </p><p>DOCUMENTATION FOR CHANGES TO HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE </p><p>SELECTION, THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN AND OTHER ALLOTMENTS, HOME </p><p>OF RECORD, AND RETIREMENT PROCESSING (WHETHER THROUGH THE </p><p>RELEVANT OPEN SEASON, UPDATING OF FAMILY STATUS OR OTHER). </p><p>ALSO INCLUDES EMPLOYEE COUNSELING, HANDLING GRIEVANCES,AND </p><p>RELATED REPORTS AND FILES.  MAY ALSO INCLUDE ADMINISTERING </p><p>THE POST LANGUAGE PROGRAM AND MISSION AWARDS PROGRAM." </p><p> </p><p>5. ADD "DEVELOPMENT OF STAFFING PATTERN AND POSITION </p><p>SCHEDULES" TO THE 6-FAH-5 H-405.1-1 BASIC PACKAGE </p><p>B. DESCRIPTION. "INCLUDED IN THESE SERVICES, DEPENDING ON </p><p>THE POSTS, ARE: DEVELOPMENT OF STAFFING PATTERN AND </p><p>POSITION SCHEDULES, DIPLOMATIC ACCREDITATION TO THE HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT, LICENSES AND SPECIAL PERMITS..." </p><p>6.
