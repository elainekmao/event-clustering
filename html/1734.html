(C) MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI TOLD CHARGE ON JUNE 4 THAT THE DEATHS THE PAST MONTH </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OF THREE ZANU-PF STALWARTS, THE LOSS OF THE MASVINGO MAYORAL </p><p>ELECTION, AND THE BACKLASH FROM THE WAR VETERANS\' "LABOR DISPUTE" </p><p>CAMPAIGN MIGHT LEAD THE RULING PARTY TO REASSESS ITS CAMPAIGN </p><p>TACTICS.  THE MDC PRESIDENT PRAISED SECRETARY POWELL\'S RECENT </p><p>REMARKS, SAYING THEY PUT ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON SOUTH AFRICA TO </p><p>DO SOMETHING ABOUT ZIMBABWE.  TSVANGIRAI SAID THE MDC ENJOYS GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA AND THE ANC, BUT HE WAS CONCERNED </p><p>THAT DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE LEADER TONY LEON\'S OUTSPOKENNESS </p><p>BOLSTERS MUGABE\'S EFFORTS TO PORTRAY THE ZIMBABWEAN OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY AS A FRONT FOR WHITE INTERESTS.   THE MDC TAKES SERIOUSLY </p><p>MUGABE\'S THREAT "NEVER, EVER" TO ALLOW IT TO GOVERN ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>BELIEVES THREE-QUARTERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WILL SUPPORT IT IN </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION EXPECTED IN 2002.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CHARGE, ACCOMPANIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF, CALLED </p><p>BRIEFLY ON MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI ON JUNE 4.  CHARGE INFORMED TSVANGIRAI THAT ASSISTANT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SECRETARY KANSTEINER HAD RECENTLY BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SENATE AND NOTED THAT WE WERE AWARE THAT TSVANGIRAI PLANNED TO </p><p>VISIT WASHINGTON FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT THE END OF JUNE -- FOLLOWING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01798  01 OF 02  051323Z </p><p>A TWO-WEEK LEADERSHIP SEMINAR AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY.  HE </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE INTERESTED </p><p>IN HEARING THE MDC PRESIDENT\'S VIEWS. </p><p> </p><p>DEATHS OF GEZI, MAHACHI, AND HUNZVI </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ASKED HIS THOUGHTS ON THE LIKELY IMPACT OF THE DEATH OF </p><p>WAR VETERAN LEADER CHENJERAI "HITLER" HUNZVI, TSVANGIRAI REPLIED, </p><p>LOOKING SKYWARD, THAT "SOMEONE UP THERE WHERE ZANU-PF DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE A MONOPOLY ON POWER" MUST BE LOOKING AFTER ZIMBABWEANS. </p><p>THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL FOR ZANU-PF, TSVANGIRAI ASSERTED. </p><p>DURING THE PAST MONTH, THE RULING PARTY HAS SUFFERED THE </p><p>DEVASTATING LOSS OF THREE FIGURES CRITICAL TO ITS TACTICS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION -- THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE, THE </p><p>MINISTER OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, GENDER, AND EMPLOYMENT CREATION, </p><p>AND NOW HUNZVI.  ZANU-PF\'S LOSS TO THE MDC IN THE MASVINGO </p><p>MAYORAL ELECTION HAD BEEN EMBARRASSING FOR THE RULING PARTY.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE RECENT EFFORT BY WAR VETERANS TO RESOLVE LABOR </p><p>DISPUTES HAD BACKFIRED BADLY FOR ZANU-PF, ALIENATING BOTH </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN VOTERS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.   THE MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT SURMISED THAT THE RULING PARTY CONSEQUENTLY MIGHT BE </p><p>REASSESSING ITS STRATEGY AND COULD DECIDE TO TRY RUNNING A </p><p>"LEGITIMATE" CAMPAIGN IN THE BULAWAYO MAYORAL RACE SCHEDULED TO </p><p>TAKE PLACE JUNE 23-24.  TSVANGIRAI INSISTED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH A </p><p>TACTICAL CHANGE WOULD ACCOMPLISH LITTLE IN BULAWAYO, AS AN MDC </p><p>VICTORY THERE WAS ALL BUT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. </p><p> </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL\'S REMARKS AND SOUTH AFRICA\'S ROLE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01798  01 OF 02  051323Z </p><p>4.  (C) THE MDC PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS PLEASED WITH SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL\'S REMARKS ABOUT ZIMBABWE, DURING HIS VISIT TO PRETORIA, </p><p>AND THAT THEY HAD SENT A MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>THAT "MUGABE\'S TIME IS UP."  HE BELIEVED POWELL\'S COMMENTS WOULD </p><p>PUT PRESSURE ON OTHER COUNTRIES WITH MORE INFLUENCE IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>TO STEP UP THEIR EFFORTS TO EFFECT POSITIVE CHANGE, SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>IN PARTICULAR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE MDC\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR, TSVANGIRAI PROVIDED AN UPBEAT ASSESSMENT, </p><p>INSISTING THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT (SAG) HAS "DEPARTED </p><p>COMPLETELY" FROM ITS ORIGINAL APPROACH.  THE SAG, HE POINTED OUT, </p><p>IS BEING MUCH MORE CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AND THE MDC ENJOYS POSITIVE TIES WITH THE SAG AND THE </p><p>ANC.  TSVANGIRAI CONTINUED, HOWEVER, THAT PEOPLE LIKE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>ALLIANCE LEADER TONY LEON "DO NOT HELP MATTERS."  LEON ACTS AS IF </p><p>HE IS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE MDC, A FACT WHICH PLAYS INTO </p><p>MUGABE\'S ATTEMPTS TO PORTRAY ZIMBABWE\'S PRINCIPAL OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY AS MERELY A FRONT FOR WHITE INTERESTS.  TSVANGIRAI WAS </p><p>PARTICULARLY UPSET ABOUT A QUESTION LEON RECENTLY POSED TO </p><p>PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI IN PARLIAMENT ABOUT LAND REFORM IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, WHICH APPARENTLY FORCED THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT TO </p><p>ENDORSE THE GOZ\'S FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>WILL MUGABE ALLOW MDC TO TAKE POWER? </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO9067 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01798  02 OF 02  051323Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------F485D1  051323Z /38 </p><p>P 051241Z JUN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9029 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001798 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 06/04/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, MARR, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC LEADER DISCUSSES ZANU-PF STRATEGY, SOUTH AFRICA, THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN MILITARY, AND SECRETARY POWELL\'S REMARKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01798  02 OF 02  051323Z </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF RECALLED PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S </p><p>REMARK ON SEVERAL PUBLIC OCCASIONS THAT HE WOULD "NEVER, EVER" </p><p>ALLOW THE MDC TO GOVERN ZIMBABWE AND ASKED HOW THE MDC WOULD </p><p>RESPOND IF MUGABE STEALS NEXT YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI RESPONDED THAT HIS PARTY TAKES MUGABE\'S THREAT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SERIOUSLY, AS IT WOULD BE NAIVE NOT TO, AND REALIZES THAT THERE </p><p>IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINNING AN ELECTION AND WINNING POWER. </p><p>THAT IS WHY HE AND OTHER SENIOR MDC OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT THE POLICE AND MILITARY ABIDE BY THE OUTCOME OF THE </p><p>ELECTION, AN EFFORT WHICH HE CLAIMED HAD BORNE FRUIT.  WHILE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE MILITARY\'S TOP BRASS RETAIN STRONG </p><p>LOYALTIES TO MUGABE, TSVANGIRAI ASSERTED THAT THREE-QUARTERS OF </p><p>THE ARMED FORCES ARE "WITH US." </p><p> </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S COURT CASE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE CHARGES PENDING AGAINST HIM FOR </p><p>ALLEGEDLY INCITING VIOLENCE, TSVANGIRAI SEEMED GENUINELY </p><p>UNCONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES.  HE STATED THAT HE </p><p>THOUGHT HIS LEGAL TEAM SHOULD HAVE AGREED TO PROCEED IN THE HIGH </p><p>COURT, AS THE CHARGES WERE BASELESS AND THE CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>DISMISSED ON THE MERITS.  IN THE END, HOWEVER, TSVANGIRAI YIELDED </p><p>TO HIS LAWYERS, WHO MAINTAINED THAT THE BEST STRATEGY WAS FIRST </p><p>TO ASK THE SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE </p><p>COLONIAL-ERA LAW UNDER WHICH HE HAS BEEN CHARGED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01798  02 OF 02  051323Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) TSVANGIRAI WAS CONFIDENT AND UPBEAT, BUT OBVIOUSLY </p><p>DISTRACTED BY HIS IMMINENT DEPARTURE FOR THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM </p><p>IN DURBAN AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, FOR THE UNITED STATES.  HE WAS </p><p>CLEARLY PLEASED ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THE MDC\'S RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH SOUTH AFRICA, AND THOUGHT THE PRIMARY VALUE OF SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL\'S RECENT REMARKS WAS TO EXERT PRESSURE ON PRETORIA TO "DO </p><p>SOMETHING" TO STOP THE LAWLESSNESS AND STANCH THE ECONOMIC </p><p>BLEEDING TO THE NORTH.  THE DEATHS OF GEZI, MAHACHI, AND HUNZVI </p><p>HAVE CAUSED SIGNIFICANT PARANOIA WITHIN THE RULING PARTY, BUT </p><p>THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT TSVANGIRAI\'S SPECULATION THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF MIGHT AS A RESULT DECIDE TO JETTISON ITS TIME-TESTED </p><p>CAMPAIGN TACTICS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION.  INDEED, </p><p>INDICATIONS ARE THAT URBAN AND RURAL VIOLENCE WILL CONTINUE TO BE </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S SIGNATURE TACTIC.  THAT THE MDC IS MAKING A DETERMINED </p><p>EFFORT TO CULTIVATE THE MILITARY REVEALS POLITICAL MATURITY AND </p><p>SAVVY, BUT TSVANGIRAI\'S CLAIM THAT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES SUPPORT THE MDC STRIKES US AS A BIT OPTIMISTIC. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
