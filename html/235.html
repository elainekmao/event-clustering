<p>UNCLAS BONN 31258 </p><p> </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PHUM, GE, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  HAS THE FRG CHANGED ITS VIEW OF THE PKK? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ANKARA 11311 </p><p> </p><p>1.  WE SUSPECT THAT WHAT THE "TERCUMAN" COLUMNIST IS </p><p>REFERRING TO IN CLAIMING THAT THE GERMANS VIEW THE PKK AS </p><p>A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION (REFTEL) IS THE ASSERTION IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S MOST RECENT INTERNAL SECURITY REPORT </p><p>(VERFASSUNGSSCHUTZBERICHT), COVERING DEVELOPMENTS IN 1987, </p><p>THAT "IN TURKEY THE PKK OPERATES IN AN OPENLY TERRORISTIC </p><p>MANNER."  THIS ASSERTION DID NOT APPEAR IN THE PREVIOUS </p><p>YEAR\'S REPORT.  OUR CONTACTS IN THE INTERIOR MINISTRY HAVE </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION IN THEIR MINDS BUT </p><p>THAT THE PKK USES TERRORIST TACTICS AND HAS PERPETRATED </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WHETHER THE PKK OR PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PKK </p><p>HAVE ENGAGED IN WHAT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>ON GERMAN SOIL IS AN ISSUE THAT IS PRESENTLY BEFORE THE </p><p>COURTS.  FOLLOWING A SERIES OF VIOLENT CRIMES (INCLUDING </p><p>MURDER AND ARSON) APPARENTLY PERPETRATED BY PKK MEMBERS IN </p><p>GERMANY, AND SEARCHES OF SEVERAL APARTMENTS BELONGING TO </p><p>PKK MEMBERS, THE FEDERAL PROSECUTOR INITIATED AN </p><p>INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER A TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION HAD BEEN FORMED IN THE FRG ON THE PERIPHERY </p><p>OF THE PKK, THE NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF KURDISTAN </p><p>(ERNK) AND THE PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY OF KURDISTAN </p><p>(ARGK).  (NOTE THAT THIS INVESTIGATION IS NOT DESIGNED TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER THE PKK IN GERMANY IS AS SUCH A </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.)  AT THE SAME TIME, SOME TWENTY </p><p>PKK MEMBERS ARE DUE TO COME TO TRIAL THIS FALL ON CHARGES </p><p>OF MURDER, ARSON, OCCUPATION ACTIONS AND THE LIKE.  THE </p><p>GERMAN AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THEY HAVE A STRONG CASE AGAINST </p><p>A NUMBER OF THESE INDIVIDUALS; BUT THAT IT WOULD BE MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT THE PKK ITSELF (IN THE FRG) IS A </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WE ARE FOR THE MOMENT UNABLE TO GET A DEFINITIVE </p><p>OPINION ON WHETHER THE FACT THAT THE GERMAN INTERNAL </p><p>SECURITY AUTHORITIES CONSIDER THE PKK (IN TURKEY) TO BE A </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATION RENDERS ITS MEMBERS INELIGIBLE FOR </p><p>POLITICAL ASYLUM IN THE FRG. </p><p> </p><p>BURT </p><p></p></div>
