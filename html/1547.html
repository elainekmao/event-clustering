(C) ACCORDING TO A HIGH-LEVEL UNION OFFICIAL WHO IS </p><p>ALSO A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY\'S NATIONAL </p><p>EXECUTIVE, THE JUST-ENDED ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE </p><p>UNION\'S (ZCTU) FIVE-YEAR CONGRESS RESULTED IN THE </p><p>ELECTION OF A NATIONAL EXECUTIVE BODY THAT SOLIDLY </p><p>SUPPORTS THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC). </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S RULING PARTY, ZANU-PF, TRIED TO BUY </p><p>DELEGATES\' VOTES RIGHT UP TO VOTING TIME AT THE </p><p>CONGRESS, BUT NOT A SINGLE PRO-ZANU-PF LABOR LEADER WAS </p><p>ELECTED TO THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE.  WHILE THE NEW </p><p>NATIONAL EXECUTIVE PUBLICLY AFFIRMED THAT THE ZCTU IS </p><p>NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY POLITICAL PARTY, AND THAT IT IS </p><p>NON-PARTISAN IN CHARACTER, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE NEW </p><p>LEADERSHIP WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE MDC IN SUPPORTING </p><p>THE PARTY\'S CANDIDATE IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON FEBRUARY 26, LABOFF MET WITH NICHOLAS </p><p>MUDZENGERERE, SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ZIMBABWE CATERING </p><p>AND HOTEL WORKERS UNION, TO DISCUSS THE OUTCOME OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00859  01 OF 02  281811Z </p><p>JUST-ENDED LABOR CONGRESS.  MUDZENGERERE IS ALSO THE </p><p>FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ZCTU, AND A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE MDC NATIONAL EXECUTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>A PRO-MDC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IS ELECTED </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MUDZENGERERE REVEALED THAT THE MDC IS VERY </p><p>PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE CONGRESS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MUDZENGERERE, ALL THE MEMBERS ELECTED TO THE NEW ZCTU </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ARE PRO-MDC LABOR LEADERS (REFTEL). </p><p>THE NEW SECRETARY-GENERAL, WILLARD CHIBHEBHE, IS THE </p><p>FORMER PRESIDENT, AND NOW A TRUSTEE OF THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>RAILWAY ARTISANS WORKERS UNION, AND HAD THE BACKING OF </p><p>THE OTHER TWO RAILWAY UNIONS.  HE ALSO WAS A CANDIDATE </p><p>FOR SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE MDC WHEN THE PARTY WAS </p><p>FIRST FORMED IN 1999, AND LATER WAS THE SECRETARY OF </p><p>POLICY AND RESEARCH FOR THE MDC.  THE NEW ZCTU </p><p>PRESIDENT, LOVEMORE MATAMBO, IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE POST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS WORKERS UNION, AND </p><p>WAS PART OF THE ZCTU GENERAL COUNCIL WHEN THE LABOR BODY </p><p>VOTED TO ORGANIZE THE MDC IN 1998.  THE OTHER NEW </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE ZCTU EXECUTIVE HAVE SIMILARLY STRONG </p><p>UNION AND MDC CREDENTIALS.  THE FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT, </p><p>LUCIA MATIBENGU, IS THE HEAD OF THE MDC WOMEN\'S LEAGUE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S VOTE BUYING FAILS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00859  01 OF 02  281811Z </p><p>4. (C) MUDZENGERERE ALLEGED THAT ZANU-PF WAS TRYING TO </p><p>BUY THE OUTCOME OF THE CONGRESS RIGHT UP UNTIL THE VOTES </p><p>WERE CAST.  HE STATED THAT ZANU-PF BAGMEN CAME TO THE </p><p>CONGRESS WITH BAGS OF CASH, AND WERE TRYING TO BRIBE </p><p>CONGRESS DELEGATES TO ENSURE THAT THEY WOULD VOTE FOR </p><p>THE PRO-ZANU-PF SLATE OF CANDIDATES.  THIS IS ON TOP OF </p><p>THE RUMORED ZIMBABWE $1.5 MILLION THAT THE RULING PARTY </p><p>PAID IN DUES ARREARAGES ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS UNIONS SO </p><p>THAT THEY COULD ATTEND THE CONGRESS AND VOTE FOR THE </p><p>PRO-ZANU-PF CANDIDATES.  HOWEVER, MUDZENGERERE INDICATED </p><p>THAT BECAUSE THE VOTING WAS BY SECRET BALLOT, ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>STRATEGY BACKFIRED, AS THE DELEGATES TOOK THE MONEY AND </p><p>THEN CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR THE PRO-MDC CANDIDATES. </p><p>EVEN THOUGH THE PRO-MDC FORCES WERE UNABLE TO PRESENT A </p><p>SINGLE SLATE, NOT ONE PRO-ZANU-PF CANDIDATE WAS ELECTED. </p><p>ISIDORE ZINDOGA, THE FORMER ACTING SECRETARY-GENERAL OF </p><p>THE ZCTU AND HEAD OF THE PRO-ZANU-PF SLATE, RECEIVED </p><p>ONLY 35 VOTES, WHILE CHIBHEBHE RECEIVED 81 VOTES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>A WARM GREETING FOR TSVANGIRAI AND SIBANDA </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9639 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00859  02 OF 02  281811Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   PM-00    PRS-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-01   G-00     SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------CBB2F4  281811Z /45 </p><p>R 280543Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8302 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000859 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DRL/IL FOR KBRYANT </p><p>NSC FOR JFRAZER </p><p>ILAB FOR RSHEPHARD </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 02/27/11 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZCTU UNION LEADER CONFIRMS THAT LABOR CONGRESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00859  02 OF 02  281811Z </p><p>OUTCOME ASSURES COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ZCTU AND THE MDC </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE FORMER SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ZCTU, AND </p><p>CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE MDC, MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, AND THE </p><p>FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE ZCTU, AND CURRENT VICE-PRESIDENT </p><p>OF THE MDC, GIBSON SIBANDA, RECEIVED A STANDING OVATION </p><p>FROM THE DELEGATES WHEN THEY ADDRESSED THE CONGRESS. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S COMMENT THAT THE "ZCTU WAS THE SOUL OF THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MDC" WAS MET WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE FROM THE </p><p>DELEGATES.  ACCORDING TO MUDZENGERERE, THERE WERE NO </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS EVIDENT AMONG THE DELEGATES AT THE </p><p>CONGRESS.  WHILE THE NEW EXECUTIVE PUBLICLY AFFIRMED </p><p>THAT THE ZCTU IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY, MUDZENGERERE MADE CLEAR THAT IN PRIVATE THE </p><p>ENTIRE NEW EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, AS WELL AS WORKERS IN </p><p>GENERAL, STRONGLY SUPPORT THE MDC AND WILL FULLY SUPPORT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>MUDZENGERERE\'S PENDING COURT CHALLENGE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN ADDITION TO HAVING STRONG LABOR CREDENTIALS, </p><p>MUDZENGERERE IS AN MDC ACTIVIST AS WELL.  HE WAS ONE OF </p><p>THE MDC CANDIDATES DEFEATED IN LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION AS A RESULT OF ZANU-PF INTIMIDATION OF VOTERS. </p><p>MUDZENGERERE REPORTEDLY LOST BY LESS THAN 60 VOTES OUT </p><p>OF AROUND 15,000 VOTES CAST IN THE MAKONI EAST DISTRICT. </p><p>HE RELATED HOW ZANU-PF THUGS AND "WAR VETS" HAD </p><p>PREVENTED COMMERCIAL FARM WORKERS FROM VOTING DURING THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00859  02 OF 02  281811Z </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  THE EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT OF </p><p>THIS INTIMIDATION, ACCORDING TO MUDZENGERERE, IS THAT </p><p>25,000 VOTED IN THE DISTRICT IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REFERENDUM (WHEN THERE WAS NO INTIMIDATION), VERSUS ONLY </p><p>15,000 IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION FOUR MONTHS LATER. </p><p>MUDZENGERERE\'S COURT CHALLENGE IS TO BE HEARD IN THE </p><p>NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE ELECTION OF A PRO-MDC NATIONAL EXECUTIVE AT </p><p>THE ZCTU CONGRESS WAS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE </p><p>FUTURE VIABILITY OF THE MDC AS A NATIONAL POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY.  HAVING ACHIEVED THIS, MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND THE </p><p>MDC LEADERSHIP CAN BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF.  WHEN THE </p><p>NEW ZCTU PRESIDENT, LOVEMORE MATAMBO, TOLD THE GOZ- </p><p>CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" NEWSPAPER THAT "THE ZCTU IS A </p><p>NON-PARTISAN BODY THAT IS NOT THE SOUL OF THE MDC", THIS </p><p>WAS FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF PRESIDENT MUGABE AND COMPANY, </p><p>AND DID NOT SIGNIFY THE TRUE LEANINGS OF THE NEW </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  WE EXPECT THAT THE NEW ZCTU LEADERSHIP WILL </p><p>WORK TO SUPPORT TSVANGIRAI\'S CANDIDACY IN THE UPCOMING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN WAYS THAT ON THE SURFACE ARE </p><p>NON-PARTISAN (E.G. VOTER REGISTRATION, VOTER EDUCATION, </p><p>GET OUT THE VOTE EFFORTS), BUT WHICH WILL SERVE TO HELP </p><p>LEVEL THE POLITICAL PLAYING FIELD.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00859  02 OF 02  281811Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
