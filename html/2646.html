<p>UNCLAS ROME 001400 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS OES/ETC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, ETRD, TBIO, IT, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: INVASIVE SPECIES:  STILL AN EXOTIC PRIORITY IN </p><p>ITALY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  01 STATE 66205 </p><p> </p><p>1.  ON MAY 2, 2001, SCICOUNS DELIVERED A COPY OF THE U.S. </p><p>NATIONAL INVASIVES MANAGEMENT PLAN (REFTEL) TO PATRIZIA DE </p><p>ANGELIS, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF MOE NATURE CONSERVATION SERVICE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01400  191528Z </p><p>IN MID-MAY, DE ANGELIS TOLD US THAT INVASIVE SPECIES IS AN </p><p>ISSUE OF GOI CONCERN, BUT AT LOW LEVEL OF PRIORITY.  IN </p><p>FACT, THE GOI RATIFIED BOTH THE BIODIVERSITY AND BERN </p><p>CONVENTIONS - WHICH PROVIDE FOR CONTROL OF INVASIVE ALIEN </p><p>SPECIES - BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE SPECIFIC REGULATIONS OR AN </p><p>ACTION PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THEM.  MOREOVER, ITALY IS FAR </p><p>BEHIND THE U.S. SINCE IT STILL HAS TO MAKE A COMPLETE LIST </p><p>NOT ONLY OF ITS INVASIVE SPECIES BUT OF PLANT AND ANIMAL </p><p>RESOURCES GENERALLY.  DE ANGELIS PROMISED TO PASS THE U.S. </p><p>PLAN TO HER OFFICE EXPERTS AND ORGANIZE A MEETING AS SOON AS </p><p>THEY HAD REVIEWED IT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  CONFIRMING THE LOW LEVEL OF INTEREST IN THE TOPIC, DE </p><p>ANGELIS AGREED TO MEET AGAIN ONLY IN DECEMBER 2001.  SHE WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY PROF. PAOLO BLASI, PRESIDENT OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>BOTANICAL SOCIETY.  BLASI CONFIRMED THAT INVASIVE PLANTS </p><p>PLAY A MINOR ROLE IN ITALY COMPARED TO NORTHERN EUROPE (15- </p><p>20 PCT VS 40-50 PCT) DUE TO THE PROTECTIVE ROLE AND GREATER </p><p>TEMPERATURE RANGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. </p><p>IN FACT, THE INGRESS OF ALIEN SPECIES ORIGINATING IN WARMER </p><p>CLIMATES INSIDE THE INNER - AND THUS HOTTER - ZONES OF </p><p>CENTRAL EUROPEAN CITIES WAS NOT IDENTIFIED IN LARGE </p><p>MEDITERRANEAN CITIES IN ITALY, WHERE THE TEMPERATURES OF THE </p><p>INNER CITY ARE STILL IN THE RANGE REQUIRED BY THE LOCAL </p><p>SPECIES.  HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE PROPORTION OF ALIEN SPECIES </p><p>TENDS TO INCREASE ALONG WITH THE INCREASING LEVELS OF HUMAN </p><p>IMPACT AND URBANIZATION, GENERALLY AS A RESULT OF CLEARING </p><p>LAND FOR AGRICULTURE OR SETTLEMENTS, OR MORE LOCALLY, THE </p><p>TRANSPLANTING OF EXOTIC PLANT MATERIALS INTO NATIVE GARDENS. </p><p>IN ITALY, PALERMO (SICILY) HAS THE GREATEST NUMBER OF </p><p>EXOTIC/ALIEN SPECIES, INVADERS COLLECTED INTO THE CITY\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01400  191528Z </p><p>BOTANICAL GARDEN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BLASI ADDED THAT ITALY IS STILL CARRYING OUT A CENSUS OF </p><p>ALIEN SPECIES IN THE ITALIAN FLORA, INVOLVING MORE THAN 20 </p><p>ITALIAN UNIVERSITIES.  HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE 2002 </p><p>EUROPEAN MAN AND BIOSPHERE MEETING WOULD BE HELD ON OCTOBER </p><p>7-11 IN ROME.  ITALY WILL PROPOSE INCLUDING ROME IN THE </p><p>WORLD BIOSPHERE RESERVE LIST. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01400 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
