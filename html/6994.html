<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002126 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/31/2020 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, KNNP, ENRG, TU, IAEA </p><p>SUBJECT: IAEA & IRAN: TURKS TO PASS USG POINTS TO THEIR </p><p>VIENNA MISSION; REQUEST CLARIFICATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 81552 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Polmiloff met MFA Disarmament Department Head Ibrahim </p><p>Yagli on March 31 and delivered reftel points.  Regarding the </p><p>information outlined in reftel para 2, tick 2, Yagli asked </p><p>whether the USG thought Iran had conducted experiments beyond </p><p>the enrichment of uranium or if we were saying that Iran had </p><p>failed to report to IAEA experiments related only to </p><p>enrichment efforts.  Polmiloff advised that we read reftel </p><p>points to mean the former, but said that we would get back to </p><p>MFA if that interpretation were incorrect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Yagli said he would pass our information to the </p><p>Turkish Mission in Vienna, where personnel from the Turkish </p><p>Atomic Energy Authority take the lead in examining Iran\'s </p><p>compliance with its NPT commitments.  Yagli added that he </p><p>knew that Iran is a party to the "standard" safeguards </p><p>protocol, but he wondered if the USG had any information that </p><p>Iran may be considering signing the additional safeguard </p><p>protocol.  In any event, he advocated that the IAEA board of </p><p>governors take a "step-by-step" approach to analyzing Iran\'s </p><p>compliance and to pushing for greater Iranian transparency. </p><p>From the Turkish perspective, Iran\'s becoming a party to the </p><p>additional protocol ought not be enough to satisfy the IAEA. </p><p>Noting that, as a neighbor of Iran, Turkey is keenly </p><p>interested, Yagli concluded by asking that the USG continue </p><p>to share with Turkey as much information about Iran\'s nuclear </p><p>efforts as it can.  He particularly signaled out USNATO\'s </p><p>presentations to Allies in Brussels as "valuable." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Action Request: Per para 2, if the correct reading of </p><p>reftel points is that Iran has conducted experiments beyond </p><p>uranium enrichment efforts, please advise so that we can </p><p>reply to our Turkish interlocutors.  End Action Request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
