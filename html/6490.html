<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000257 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, IO/UNP, R, PA/OA </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, PHUM, PREL, OPRC, MOPS, VM, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMUNIST YOUTH ORGANIZATION HOLDS PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ WAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The HCMC Youth Union organized a boisterous, but </p><p>peaceful demonstration by more than 5000 high school and college </p><p>students at the District One Youth Center on March 17.  The rally </p><p>featured speakers and musical performances to appeal to the kind </p><p>of young audience which frequents the Youth Center for cultural </p><p>events.  Part of an ongoing peaceful campaign of mass organization </p><p>demonstrations against going to war in Iraq, the two-hour </p><p>gathering was well planned and organized, and received extensive </p><p>national press coverage.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Youth Center, located just two blocks from the U.S. </p><p>Consulate, was packed with young people carrying banners made of </p><p>red bunting lettered with anti-war slogans, as well as cut-out </p><p>letters spelling N-O-W-A-R, and hand-drawn posters with images and </p><p>slogans in English like, "Peace For Iraq", "No War", and "Stop </p><p>Bombing."  The mood was boisterous, as protestors jumped up and </p><p>down and swayed their signs to the beat of the music, but under </p><p>control.  The rally started at 6:00 pm and ended promptly at 8:00 </p><p>pm, with participants collecting piles of white birds folded from </p><p>paper, symbolizing peace. </p><p> </p><p>3.  As with other demonstrations we have seen (reftel) -- </p><p>demonstrations in Vietnam are almost always organized by Communist </p><p>Party mass organizations, like the Youth Union -- the speeches </p><p>outlined Vietnam\'s oft-repeated anti-war policy.  The event was </p><p>filmed by the national television station and carried by the three </p><p>newspapers with the largest readership in Vietnam (Saigon Giai </p><p>Phong, Thanh Nien and Tuoi Tre). </p><p> </p><p>4.  On March 18, ConGen received a fax from the Fatherland Front </p><p>Committee of the province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau addressed to the </p><p>governments of the U.S. and the U.K.  The letter said that the </p><p>people of Ba Ria-Vung Tau had suffered during the Vietnam War and </p><p>empathized with the people of Iraq.  The Committee had organized a </p><p>meeting the day before and decided to send this letter advocating </p><p>the same points raised in reftel, as well as asking for an end to </p><p>the economic embargo against Iraq and more time for the UN weapons </p><p>inspections team to ensure that Iraq complies with UNSCR 1441. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Comment:  This is not the first example of the Communist Party </p><p>of Vietnam organizing a demonstration to show public support for </p><p>its policy positions, but it seemed to be one of the more genuine </p><p>outpourings of peaceful concern.  Nearly 70 percent of the </p><p>population of Ho Chi Minh City is under 30 years-old, and most </p><p>students can easily be mobilized to attend these events through </p><p>school networks and busing.  In this case, many of the banners </p><p>were in English, though next day press reports noted only two </p><p>Westerners in attendance.  In a country where opportunities for </p><p>public expression are extremely limited and orchestrated, this may </p><p>have been one occasion where GVN official policy actually </p><p>reflected sentiments close to the students\' own. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
