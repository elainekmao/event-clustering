(U) Local press prominently reported the resolution of a </p><p>strike by forty laborers against a contracting firm on March 11. </p><p>The employees stopped working for a week to protest the decision </p><p>of the firm to pay them daily instead of monthly (why daily </p><p>payments were perceived as pernicious by the workers is not </p><p>clear).  Though the original work contract mandated daily </p><p>payments, the employer had been paying wages on a monthly basis </p><p>for the previous six months. The Labour Disputes Section of the </p><p>Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs dispatched a team to </p><p>investigate the complaint and mediated an agreement between the </p><p>parties, convincing the workers to end their protest.  The </p><p>Ministry sided with the workers and concluded that since they had </p><p>been paid monthly for the last six months, the original contract </p><p>was superceded. The contractor agreed to abide by the Ministry\'s </p><p>decision. </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) Comment:  As this example demonstrates, workers in the </p><p>UAE enjoy some degree of latitude when it comes to exercising </p><p>their rights.  The environment fostered by the government is </p><p>generally permissive, explaining why the occasional work </p><p>stoppage/strike, while technically unsanctioned in law, is </p><p>nonetheless viewed benignly by the authorities.  Although these </p><p>informal rights are not inconsiderable, the UAE federal </p><p>government--in an effort to further modernize the economy -- is </p><p>nonetheless pushing forward with formal legislation to </p><p>institutionalize unions and clearly define their role (see </p><p>reftels). </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
