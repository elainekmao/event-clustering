MYERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EINV, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: GREATER TRANSPARENCY FOR THE UAE BUDGET IN-LINE </p><p>WITH IMF RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABU DHABI 526 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Richard A. Albright </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) UAE Minister of State for Finance Dr. Mohammed </p><p>Khalfan Khirbash forwarded the 2003-2005 federal budgets to </p><p>the UAE Cabinet for approval 5/18, and announced that </p><p>future budgets would be based on internationally accepted </p><p>classification of fiscal revenues and expenditures.  In its </p><p>last Article IV Consultation, the IMF urged the UAEG to </p><p>adopt these standards in an effort to increase transparency </p><p>and consistency in the UAE\'s budget process.  Khirbash </p><p>acknowledged that previous UAE federal budgets -- based on </p><p>the antiquated chapter system -- allocated a set amount of </p><p>money to each ministry every fiscal year regardless of </p><p>their actual requirements (see reftel).  The 2003 budget </p><p>onward, however, will apportion money to ministries based </p><p>on their programs, and require each ministry to justify </p><p>monies spent. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The UAEG undertook budget reform at the urging of </p><p>the IMF and UNDP in December 2002, according to press </p><p>reports.  The UAEG hired consulting firm KPMG to train </p><p>Finance Ministry officials on internationally accepted </p><p>accounting guidelines, and assist the Ministry to prepare </p><p>the 2003 federal budget.  In February 2003, the Finance </p><p>Ministry requested the other ministries to forward a </p><p>"performance-based" budget taking into consideration </p><p>upcoming programs during the fiscal year.  UNDP also held a </p><p>number of workshops to train officials from the other </p><p>ministries and federal institutions on how best to develop </p><p>such a budget.  The final phase will require the UAEG to </p><p>pass legislation codifying the new budget process. </p><p>Khirbash estimates that it will take another six to eight </p><p>months to complete the entire shift from the old budget </p><p>system, and may take up to three years to work out all of </p><p>the kinks. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: The lack of reliable, timely, and complete </p><p>fiscal data for the UAE hampers economic analysis, and </p><p>paints an inaccurate picture of the health of the economy. </p><p>UAE fiscal data has suffered from incomplete coverage of </p><p>fiscal accounts (such as investment income from ADIA\'s </p><p>assets), off-budget activities, information on financing </p><p>the budget, and double counting of some government </p><p>activities.  Many expenditures are omitted from the budget, </p><p>including transfers from Abu Dhabi to the northern emirates </p><p>as well as aid transfers abroad.  Despite Khirbash\'s </p><p>announcement, we\'re skeptical that the UAEG will completely </p><p>open its books and reveal such sensitive information, but </p><p>any modification to the UAEG bookkeeping in-line with IMF </p><p>recommendations would be an improvement.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
