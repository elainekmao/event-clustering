Erdogan did not make any commitment on the troop </p><p>deployment issue, and said it would be taken up after the </p><p>new cabinet is formed.  Erdogan reminded VP Cheney of the </p><p>Turks\' sensitivities, and admitted that the government would </p><p>not be able to survive a second defeat of the resolution in </p><p>parliament.  With hopes to get a new UNSC resolution </p><p>gradually fading, reports suggest that the Washington </p><p>Administration has stepped up pressure on Ankara.  Cheney, </p><p>impatient for an immediate response regarding the use of a </p><p>Turkish air corridor, was not happy with Erdogan\'s response, </p><p>according to today\'s press.  Papers expect Erdogan to </p><p>present his cabinet list to President Sezer for approval on </p><p>Friday.  The new government program will be discussed in the </p><p>parliament on Tuesday, and the vote of confidence will be </p><p>sought on Thursday, March 20.  Some reports suggest that the </p><p>government could submit a second decree for troop deployment </p><p>to the parliament as early as March 21. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Court closed pro-Kurdish HADEP: The Constitutional Court has </p><p>banned pro-Kurdish HADEP (People\'s Democracy Party) for </p><p>allegedly providing support to terrorist activities.  The </p><p>Court\'s justification claimed that HADEP has provided </p><p>`concrete support\' to the terrorist PKK, and ruled that 46 </p><p>party members, including chairman Murat Bozlak, are barred </p><p>from politics for five years.  Chief Prosecutor Kanadoglu </p><p>has also filed a case for the closure of DEHAP, a party </p><p>regarded as the `continuation\' of HADEP.  The HADEP </p><p>leadership has denounced the court\'s decision as a </p><p>`political massacre,\' and the party is expected to appeal to </p><p>the ECHR.  "Yeni Safak" notes that the closure decision for </p><p>HADEP came immediately after the ECHR ruling calling for the </p><p>retrial of PKK leader Ocalan.  The paper sees the </p><p>development as another instance of Turkey\'s defiance of </p><p>Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Post Djindjic assassination in Serbia and the Balkans </p><p>2. Iraq and US-Turkey relations </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> "Djindjic was victimized by foreign intervention" </p><p>Ferai Tinc commented on the assassination of the Serbian </p><p>leader in mass appeal Hurriyet (3/14): "Djindjic was killed </p><p>on the eve of a meeting to shape Kosovo\'s future structure. </p><p>Although a decade has already gone by, the process of the </p><p>dissolution of the former Yugoslavia has not yet been </p><p>concluded.  Djindjic was one of the victims of the `divide </p><p>and restructure\' process.  . Djindjic had found himself </p><p>trapped between his efforts to clean out the country\'s </p><p>underworld figures and organizations on the one hand, and </p><p>foreign pressure about Kosovo on the other.  The internal </p><p>situation also did not help him, as some ultra nationalist </p><p>movements continued to flourish at a time of economic </p><p>difficulty.  The demise of Djindjic opens a new page in the </p><p>Balkans story.  It also shows that none of the Balkan- </p><p>related problems, including Bosnia, has been resolved." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bush pressures; Erdogan resists" </p><p>Murat Yetkin commented in the liberal-intellectual Radikal </p><p>(3/14): "President Bush sent a letter to AKP leader Erdogan </p><p>which, in fact, was an ultimatum about Iraq wrapped in </p><p>diplomatic courtesy.  Yet Erdogan, with the help of the </p><p>Turkish Foreign Ministry, studied the ultimatum as two </p><p>separate parts.  The decision is to continue cooperation </p><p>between Turkey and the US, but to decline, for the moment, </p><p>the request for permission to open Turkish airspace for US </p><p>air strikes.  Erdogan believes that neither the political </p><p>nor the legal framework is ready for requesting this </p><p>permission from the parliament.  The parliament </p><p>authorization will be initiated as soon as the new </p><p>government is formed, and right after it receives the vote </p><p>of confidence. . Nobody can possibly predict where this is </p><p>going to go.  But one thing is clear: Washington is </p><p>increasing the pressure, and Ankara continues to resist." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
