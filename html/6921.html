<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002052 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMARCHES ON WAR SUPPLEMENTAL AND BOLSTERING </p><p>MARKET CONFIDENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) STATE 77719 </p><p>     B. (B) STATE 74060 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an action request -- see para 9. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary:  DCM delivered ref A and B points to </p><p>Treasury U/S Oztrak and MFA Deputy U/S Kilic March 26-27, and </p><p>EconCouns separately presented them to State Planning U/S </p><p>Tiktik and AK Deputy Reha Denemec.  DCM stressed that USG was </p><p>very concerned about the lack of market confidence in GOT </p><p>economic policies, and strongly urged the government to take </p><p>tangible steps quickly to restore confidence.  He noted that </p><p>USG assistance could be helpful in that context, but that </p><p>Congress\' willingness to approve that assistance would depend </p><p>greatly on Turkish cooperation in the days and weeks ahead, </p><p>particularly on Northern Iraq.  GOT officials welcomed the </p><p>U.S. move as a sign the Administration wants to maintain the </p><p>relationship, but stressed that they would not rely on </p><p>possible assistance in their economic planning.  While our </p><p>economic interlocutors did not delve into the forward </p><p>military cooperation that could help garner Congressional </p><p>support for the Administration\'s request, we would welcome </p><p>guidance in the expectation that such questions will be </p><p>forthcoming.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In meetings March 26 and 27, DCM delivered reftel </p><p>points to Treasury U/S Faik Oztrak and MFA Deputy U/S Kilic, </p><p>while EconCouns presented them to State Planning U/S Tiktik </p><p>and AK Deputy Reha Denemec, who is close to PM Erdogan.  We </p><p>stressed USG concern about the fragility of Turkey\'s public </p><p>finances, as market players tell us their confidence in the </p><p>government is extremely low, and urged the government to move </p><p>rapidly to conclude its LOI with the IMF and to take </p><p>additional steps to bolster market confidence.  DCM stressed </p><p>that the President\'s decision to include the assistance </p><p>request in the War Supplemental reflected U.S. recognition of </p><p>Turkey\'s importance and economic problems, but warned that </p><p>improved cooperation on Iraq, particularly Northern Iraq, </p><p>would be critical in overcoming Congressional skepticism </p><p>about the aid in light of recent unfavorable developments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Treasury U/S Oztrak and SPO U/S Tiktik welcomed the </p><p>U.S. move and noted that it had already bolstered the </p><p>markets, but said the government would not count on the money </p><p>in formulating its economic plans.  They, along with MP </p><p>Denemec, acknowledged Turkey\'s financial fragility and the </p><p>lack of market confidence.  They argued that the government </p><p>was fully committed to implementing the reform program, </p><p>including reaching final agreement with the IMF, and noted </p><p>recent comments to that effect by PM Erdogan and Deputy PM </p><p>Sener.  DCM/EconCouns responded that investors wanted more </p><p>than rhetoric; they were insisting on concrete steps, </p><p>including rapid completion of the 4th review, accelerated </p><p>privatization, and steps to improve the investment </p><p>environment.  Oztrak pointed out that the government had </p><p>taken many tangible steps, including approval of new taxes, </p><p>and would shortly approve a very tight budget and </p><p>long-delayed direct tax reform.  He conceded, however, that </p><p>the government, like its predecessor, tended to emphasize in </p><p>public those policies that played to its constituents (i.e. </p><p>populist policies), while staying mum on its more </p><p>"responsible" policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Deputy U/S Kilic also welcomed the proposed U.S. </p><p>assistance, saying it not only bolstered market confidence </p><p>but also indicated that the bilateral relationship was back </p><p>on track.  He understood it involved double conditionality: </p><p>approval by the Congress, and -- even assuming that approval </p><p>-- continuing Turkish cooperation on Iraq.  He noted that </p><p>Turkey was well aware of Congressional sensitivities -- they </p><p>had experience with the Congress on such matters in the past </p><p>-- and thus saw this as a good test case.  DCM responded that </p><p>the decision clearly reflected the Administration\'s desire to </p><p>assist Turkey, but that we were also looking to Turkey to </p><p>find ways to help us on Iraq.  He noted that the Embassy was </p><p>keeping track of Turkish cooperation, such as recent </p><p>permissions to allow U.S. aircraft to make emergency </p><p>landings, but believed more could be done. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Kilic said Turkey had plenty of goodwill and was </p><p>anxious to restore the "long-cherished" bilateral </p><p>relationship.  It wanted to do that, irrespective of the fate </p><p>of the proposed assistance package.  He acknowleged that </p><p>recent developments had harmed the relationship, and noted </p><p>that the GOT had made several forthcoming moves in recent </p><p>days to help repair the damage.    Kilic also noted Turkey\'s </p><p>interest in participating in Iraq reconstruction, and asked </p><p>that the Embassy provide whatever information it could. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment:  While we received some questions about </p><p>financial conditions of the supplemental request, none of our </p><p>interlocutors posed questions about military cooperation </p><p>requirements.  They chose to view the request as a sign that </p><p>there is a U.S. commitment to a strong relationship with </p><p>mutual support, but like most of Turkey, they did not look </p><p>proactively on how they could act to demonstrate Turkey\'s </p><p>support for the U.S.  While they obviously recognize the </p><p>possibility that Congress will not support the </p><p>Administration\'s request, they seem unwilling to look for </p><p>areas where they might be helpful.  We recognize that reftel </p><p>makes no direct linkage between assistance and support for </p><p>U.S. military operations in Iraq.  Nonetheless, it could be </p><p>helpful to offer the Turks some ideas of support that would </p><p>strengthen the Administration\'s arguments in seeking </p><p>Congressional approval of the assistance request.  Such </p><p>support might include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Stronger political support of the coalition in </p><p>international fora; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Facilitating humanitarian relief across the border; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Support for commerical logistical resupply of non-military </p><p>items for U.S. forces in Northern Iraq; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Continuing support for emergency landings at Turkish </p><p>airbases for refueling or other "humanitarian" reasons; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- An established, flexible approach to medical evacuation </p><p>and SAR needs coming out of Iraq for assistance at medical </p><p>facilities in Turkey, such as Incirlik; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Any additional military requests, such as basing CSAR </p><p>assets or tankers from Turkey, that would require further </p><p>Parliamentary approval, must be treated in a different </p><p>category.  PM Erdogan has been quoted repeatedly as saying </p><p>another motion is not under consideration.  Many speculate </p><p>such an idea has become increasingly problematic as coverage </p><p>of the ongoing war has turned Turkish attitudes even more </p><p>negative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Mission would appreciate any further guidance </p><p>available on how the assistance request would relate to </p><p>further support elements we seek. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
