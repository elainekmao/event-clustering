(C) SUMMARY: TEN WEEKS BEFORE ASSUMING THE EU PRESIDENCY, </p><p>ITALIAN MFA INDICATED THAT A VISIT BY PM BERLUSCONI TO ISRAEL </p><p>WAS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN EARLY JUNE, EMPHASIZED ITALY\'S </p><p>POSITIVE BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL, UNDERLINED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE ON PALESTINIAN REFORM AND </p><p>ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION THAT WILL TAKE PLACE IN ROME MAY </p><p>28-29, AND WAS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE EU </p><p>ENDORSING BERLUSCONI\'S MARSHALL PLAN FOR THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>ECONOMY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>POSSIBLE VISITS TO ISRAEL AND THE REGION </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON APRIL 15, POL MC MET WITH LUCA FERRARI, THE MFA\'S </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR ISRAEL AND PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS.  FERRARI </p><p>SAID THAT BERLUSCONI AND SHARON ENJOYED WARM PERSONAL </p><p>RELATIONS AND WERE IN REGULAR TELEPHONE CONTACT.  BERLUSCONI </p><p>WANTED TO VISIT ISRAEL BEFORE ITALY ASSUMED THE EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY, PROBABLY IN THE FIRST TEN DAYS OF JUNE, SAID </p><p>FERRARI.  ARRANGING THIS TRIP, HE ADDED HOWEVER, DEPENDED ON </p><p>BEING ABLE TO SET UP A MEANINGFUL MEETING WITH ABU MAZEN </p><p>"WHILE AVOIDING ANYTHING MORE THAN A HANDSHAKE WITH ARAFAT." </p><p>IF THAT PROVED TOO DIFFICULT, THE ALTERNATIVES WOULD BE </p><p>EITHER FOR SHARON TO COME TO ITALY OR FOR BERLUSCONI TO GO TO </p><p>JERUSALEM AND AVOID MEETING PALESTINIANS ALTOGETHER. </p><p>BERLUSCONI WOULD LIKE TO VISIT JORDAN, EGYPT, AND POSSIBLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01665  01 OF 02  171655Z </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA ON THE SAME TRIP, SAID FERRARI.  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>SEPARATE GOI PLANS INVOLVED SENDING MANTICA, THE MFA\'S UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY FOR MIDDLE EASTERN AND AFRICAN AFFAIRS, TO LEBANON, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SYRIA, AND PROBABLY ALSO JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA BEFORE ITALY </p><p>ASSUMED THE EU PRESIDENCY ON JULY 1.  THERE WAS NO PLAN FOR </p><p>FM FRATTINI TO VISIT ANY OF THESE COUNTRIES, SAID FERRARI. </p><p>POL MC ASKED THAT THE GOI CONSULT WITH US CLOSELY ON ANY </p><p>POSSIBLE MEETING OF SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS WITH ABU MAZEN </p><p>AND/OR ARAFAT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MANY EU COUNTRIES HAVE OFTEN "MADE THE MISTAKE OF </p><p>KEEPING ISRAEL AT ARM\'S LENGTH," LAMENTED FERRARI, THUS </p><p>MINIMIZING THE EU\'S INFLUENCE ON THE MEPP.  THE GOI, ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, HAS BEEN TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE TO ISRAEL THAT ITS </p><p>INTEREST IS NOT LIMITED ONLY TO THE MEPP BUT EXTENDED TO </p><p>BILATERAL TECHNICAL COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL, AS MANIFESTED BY </p><p>VISITS IN RECENT MONTHS TO ISRAEL BY THE ITALIAN MINISTER OF </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ITALIAN MINISTER OF PRODUCTIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>CONFERENCE ON PALESTINIAN REFORM </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) FERRARI UNDERLINED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE </p><p>THE GOI IS ORGANIZING IN ROME MAY 28-29 ON PALESTINIAN REFORM </p><p>AND ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION.  HE SAID THAT THE GOI HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01665  01 OF 02  171655Z </p><p>CAREFULLY COORDINATED THIS CONFERENCE NOT ONLY WITH THE GREEK </p><p>PRESIDENCY OF THE EU, BUT ALSO WITH THE ISRAELIS AND THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  FERRARI WAS VERY HOPEFUL FOR HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>ATTENDANCE AT THIS CONFERENCE, AND EXPRESSED SPECIAL INTEREST </p><p>IN A/S BURNS PARTICIPATING IN IT (REF A).  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>SEPARATE MEETINGS OF THE QUARTET MEMBERS COULD TAKE PLACE </p><p>DURING THE CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>EUROSMEC </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) FERRARI WAS CAUTIOUSLY CONFIDENT THAT THE ITALIAN </p><p>CANDIDATE LAURA MIRACHIAN WOULD REPLACE MIGAEL ANGEL </p><p>MORATINOS AS THE EUROSMEC (EUROPEAN SPECIAL MIDDLE EAST </p><p>COORDINATOR).  FERRARI WAS HOPEFUL THAT MIRACHIAN WOULD BE </p><p>INFORMALLY APPROVED BY THE EU FMS IN THEIR MAY 2 GYMNICH </p><p>MEETING.  HE FELT THE ITALIAN CANDIDATE HAD THE BACKING OF </p><p>THE U.K., PORTUGAL, SPAIN, AND GREECE.  THE FRENCH, SAID </p><p>FERRARI, HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OPPOSED TO AN ITALIAN CANDIDATE FOR </p><p>THIS POSITION.  THE FRENCH POSITION WAS NOW MORE UNYIELDING, </p><p>GIVEN THE FRANCO-ITALIAN DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL DIFFERENCES </p><p>ON IRAQ, BUT THE FRENCH WERE UNABLE TO PROMOTE ANY CREDIBLE </p><p>ALTERNATIVE TO MIRACHIAN.

HOWEVER, </p><p>FERRARI WAS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE EU </p><p>ENDORSING THE MARSHALL PLAN IDEA.  FIRST, MANY MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>EU WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO GIVE ITALY, AND SPECIFICALLY </p><p>BERLUSCONI, CREDIT FOR SUCH A PROGRAM.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, </p><p>MOST EU MEMBERS WERE NOT INTERESTED IN POOLING THEIR </p><p>BILATERAL DONATIONS TO THE PALESTINIANS, BEYOND THAT ALREADY </p><p>MANDATED BY THE EU BUDGET. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01665 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
