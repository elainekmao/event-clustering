<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 001179 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, DRL (ANKSE) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, EAID, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Mission recommends alternate organization for </p><p>implementing judicial reform grant </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  02 Colombo 2110, and previous </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is an action request.  Please see Para 6. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  The judicial reform project to </p><p>increase the capacity of courts in Sri Lanka\'s war-torn </p><p>north and east, as well as administer legal aid to those </p><p>affected communities, has been only partially </p><p>successful.  The portion of the grant related to </p><p>equipment purchase for the courts has gone smoothly. </p><p>The organization designated to provide legal aid </p><p>services has caused Mission to doubt their ability to </p><p>fully undertake the task.  Mission requests a </p><p>redirection of remaining funds to another organization </p><p>more capable of completing the required activities. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BACKGROUND ON JUDICIAL REFORM PROJECT:  Mission </p><p>received a USD 250,000 grant from DRL to address </p><p>judicial reform and provide legal aid in the north and </p><p>east of Sri Lanka, where the court system has been </p><p>devastated due to three decades of ethnic conflict.  The </p><p>grant had two discrete tasks:  purchase and deliver </p><p>equipment to enable functioning of courts in the north </p><p>and east and setup and equip a Colombo-based office to </p><p>administer judicial reform projects, beginning with </p><p>legal assistance to vulnerable populations in conflict </p><p>affected areas.  The Sri Lanka National Commission of </p><p>Jurists (SNCJ) was the local non-governmental </p><p>organization (NGO) awarded the grant for carrying out </p><p>the second goal of the grant -- providing legal aid.  In </p><p>an effort to enable the SNCJ to demonstrate capacity, </p><p>the second part of the grant was divided into two parts </p><p>of office setup and program development. </p><p> </p><p>4.  CURRENT STATUS OF EFFORTS:  The first goal of </p><p>the project is nearing completion.  Court equipment has </p><p>been purchased and Mission is making final arrangements </p><p>to present the items to the Ministry of Justice. </p><p>Regarding the SNCJ\'s tenure, however, the organization </p><p>has demonstrated a lack of capacity in being unable to </p><p>carry out the first part of its grant.  The SNCJ was </p><p>given ample time to establish and equip an office in </p><p>Colombo.  During this time frame, Mission has observed </p><p>that the SNCJ has been unable to undertake basic </p><p>management tasks, make decisions in a timely fashion, </p><p>hire responsible staff, or prove fiscal management </p><p>competency.  These actions have cast doubt on the SNCJ\'s </p><p>ability to effectively plan and budget for implementing </p><p>legal aid programs on behalf of the disaffected </p><p>communities in the north and east. </p><p> </p><p>5.  RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:  In assessing the </p><p>situation, Mission has determined that redirecting the </p><p>remaining funds, for program planning, to another </p><p>organization will allow for more efficient utilization </p><p>of the funds as well as having the greatest impact in </p><p>delivering legal aid.  After a careful review of capable </p><p>organizations, Mission recommends that the government- </p><p>funded Legal Aid Commission receive the funds to </p><p>complete the second task of providing legal aid.  By </p><p>working with this public statutory body, Mission will be </p><p>able to have both a short- and long-term impact on rule </p><p>of law issues in Sri Lanka.  Given the Legal Aid </p><p>Commission\'s current organization to be able to engage </p><p>lawyers in all court centers, the grant money will </p><p>immediately enhance their efforts.  Over the long-term, </p><p>Mission will be able to develop a relationship with the </p><p>government, building within the GSL a positive focus on </p><p>human rights and rule of law issues.  This relationship </p><p>will augment Mission\'s current USAID Democracy and </p><p>Governance programs. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACTION REQUEST:  Mission requests that remaining </p><p>funds be reprogrammed to the Legal Aid Commission to </p><p>complete the tasks set forth in the judicial reform </p><p>project. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  Given the desire to aid vulnerable </p><p>communities in the north and east and be consistent with </p><p>the spirit of the grant, Mission believes that endowing </p><p>a different organization with the funding to carry out </p><p>legal aid activities will have the most impact.  With </p><p>many international donors providing significant funding </p><p>to local NGOs, Mission would like to use this </p><p>opportunity to build a sustainable relationship with the </p><p>government, supporting its efforts to address the needs </p><p>of its people.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
