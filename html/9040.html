<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  DUBAI 2696 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, IR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: IRANIANS EAGER TO JOIN THE INFORMATION AGE, BUT </p><p>TEHRAN HAS SECOND THOUGHTS </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY ACTING CONSUL GENERAL JOHN LANCIA FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: IRANIAN USE OF THE INTERNET AND CELLULAR </p><p>COMMUNICATION IS RAPIDLY EXPANDING AND THE TREND LOOKS SET </p><p>TO CONTINUE. CONOFF SPOKE WITH A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND AN </p><p>INTERNET/TELECOM COMPANY OWNER IN MAY ABOUT IRANIAN USE OF </p><p>THE INTERNET AND MOBILE PHONES. THEY INDICATED THAT BOTH </p><p>BUSINESSES ARE GROWING STEADILY DESPITE IRAN\'S POOR </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE. THE REGIME, HOWEVER, MAY BE HAVING SECOND </p><p>THOUGHTS ABOUT THE FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION. IN MID-MAY </p><p>TEHRAN TOOK MEASURES TO CURTAIL ACCESS TO SOME WEBSITES IT </p><p>DEEMS IMMORAL OR THAT DISSEMINATE ANTI-REGIME POLITICAL AND </p><p>SOCIAL VIEWS, BUT THEIR EFFORTS MAY PROVE FUTILE. CONOFF </p><p>POLLED IRANIAN VISA APPLICANTS IN MAY AND JUNE ABOUT THE </p><p>IMPACT OF THE GOVERNMENT FILTERING AND FOUND MOST </p><p>INTERVIEWEES\' USE OF THE INTERNET UNAFFECTED BY THE NEW </p><p>MEASURES. MOST OF THOSE SURVEYED SAID THAT FILTERING MAY </p><p>PREVENT THEM FROM LOOKING UP SPECIFIC SITES ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>PROMINENT IRANIAN DISSIDENTS OR PRO-REFORM NEWSPAPERS, BUT </p><p>IT WAS HAVING LITTLE IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO GET NEWS </p><p>ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS IN IRAN, WHICH FOR THEM WAS MORE </p><p>IMPORTANT. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>IRANIANS LINING UP TO DIAL UP </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) URBAN IRANIANS ARE CLAMORING TO BE CONNECTED TO THE </p><p>INTERNET AND IRANIAN BUSINESSES ARE STEPPING IN TO MEET THE </p><p>RISING DEMAND, ALTHOUGH NOT WITHOUT OBSTACLES. CONOFF SPOKE </p><p>WITH A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND THE OWNER OF A SMALL INTERNET </p><p>COMPANY IN TEHRAN IN MAY TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO IRAN\'S LEAP </p><p>INTO THE GLOBAL INFORMATION AGE. ACCORDING TO THE U.S.- </p><p>TRAINED SOFTWARE ENGINEER, IRAN\'S INTERNET SERVICES ARE </p><p>DOMINATED BY A HANDFUL OF LARGE COMPANIES, ALTHOUGH A </p><p>NUMBER OF SMALL COMPANIES ARE SURVIVING DUE TO SHEER DEMAND </p><p>VOLUME. THE ENGINEER SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED PARS ONLINE, </p><p>WHICH IS PATTERNED AFTER U.S.-BASED AMERICA ONLINE, AS ONE </p><p>OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST RELIABLE PROVIDERS OF INTERNET </p><p>SERVICES IN IRAN. THE OWNER OF A SMALL INTERNET COMPANY IN </p><p>IRAN SHARED HIS VIEWS ON THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT FACING </p><p>TELECOM COMPANIES IN IRAN. HE SAID HIS COMPANY WAS ONE OF </p><p>HUNDREDS IN TEHRAN THAT WAS SEEKING TO CAPITALIZE ON THE </p><p>BOOM IN INTERNET, CELLULAR, AND CALLING CARD SERVICES IN </p><p>IRAN. HOWEVER, HE LAMENTED THE LACK OF PRIVATIZATION WITHIN </p><p>THE INDUSTRY, FOREIGN COMPETITION WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE, </p><p>AND THE SLOW PACE WITH WHICH IRANIAN INSTITUTIONS WERE </p><p>ADAPTING TO LARGE-SCALE USE OF THE INTERNET. FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>HE SAID THAT IRAN HAS NO E-COMMERCE CAPABILITY, WHICH </p><p>PREVENTS IRANIAN BUSINESSES FROM ADVERTISING AND </p><p>CAPITALIZING ON THE HUGE GROWTH IN INTERNET USE. HE </p><p>CONTINUED BY SAYING THAT IRANIAN BANKS KNOW OF THE </p><p>TECHNOLOGY, BUT WERE SLOW TO ADAPT, RESULTING IN THE LOSS </p><p>OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF POTENTIAL REVENUE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) FOR MOST IRANIANS ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IS EASY, </p><p>ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNG, AND IT IS STEADILY GAINING </p><p>ACCEPTANCE AMONG ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY. ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>SOFTWARE ENGINEER THE FIRST STEP INVOLVES BUYING A PREPAID </p><p>INTERNET CARD, WHICH ALLOWS IRANIANS TO DIAL UP FROM ANY </p><p>CONNECTED PC AND GAIN ACCESS. THE CHARGE IS RELATIVELY </p><p>CHEAP FOR IRANIANS, ACCORDING TO SEVERAL STUDENTS CONOFF </p><p>SPOKE WITH IN JUNE, RUNNING BETWEEN 2000 TO 4500 IRANIAN </p><p>RIALS (IRR) PER HOUR (.24 TO .55 USD WITH 1 USD = 8170 IRR </p><p>AS OF 23 JUNE 2003). BOTH THE ENGINEER AND THE INTERNET </p><p>BUSINESS OWNER ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 2 </p><p>MILLION INTERNET USERS IN TEHRAN. BOTH SAID THAT IRAN\'S </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITIES ARE PLANNING FOR A SURGE OF </p><p>UP TO 20 MILLION USERS NATIONWIDE WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE BOOM IN INTERNET SERVICE IS HAVING AN EFFECT ON </p><p>RELATED BUSINESS SECTORS, SUCH AS COMPUTER SALES. THE </p><p>SOFTWARE ENGINEER SAID THAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ABOUND </p><p>IN THE COMPUTER FIELD, SPURRED BY IRANIANS\' DESIRE TO BE </p><p>CONNECTED TO THE WORLD. HE CONTINUED BY SAYING THAT THE </p><p>TREND IN GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY IS TO COMPUTERIZE, AND </p><p>SIGNIFICANT FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT TO MODERNIZE ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>PROCESS IS MOVING SLOWLY. FOR EXAMPLE, AN EMPLOYEE OF </p><p>IRAN\'S CENTRAL BANK SAID THAT CURRENTLY THERE WAS NO </p><p>COMPUTER SYSTEM ALLOWING THE CENTRAL BANK OR OTHER BANKS IN </p><p>TEHRAN TO COMMUNICATE WITH BRANCHES IN OTHER CITIES. THIS </p><p>SHORTFALL SEVERELY LIMITS THE CENTRAL BANK\'S AUDITING </p><p>CAPABILITY, AND THE BANK\'S MANAGEMENT HOPES COMPUTERIZATION </p><p>MAY SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE ENGINEER WENT ON TO SAY THAT </p><p>PERSONAL COMPUTERS WERE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN IRAN. MOST </p><p>SYSTEMS RELIED ON IMPORTED PARTS, WHICH WERE THEN ASSEMBLED </p><p>IN IRAN. HE ESTIMATED THE COST OF A COMPUTER TO BE ROUGHLY </p><p>4.1 MILLION IRR (APPROXIMATELY 500 USD WITH $1=8170 IRR AS </p><p>OF 23 JUNE 2003), NOT ENTIRELY OUT OF REACH FOR MIDDLE </p><p>CLASS IRANIANS. HE INDICATED THAT GETTING SPECIALIZED </p><p>EQUIPMENT, LIKE NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS, WAS MORE DIFFICULT, BUT </p><p>A LOT OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT FROM ASIAN MANUFACTURERS IN </p><p>KOREA, CHINA, AND JAPAN IS FLOWING INTO IRANIAN MARKETS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>REGIME, OTHER OBSTACLES IMPEDE THE FLOW OF INFORMATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) TEHRAN\'S EFFORTS AT CENSORSHIP OF THE INTERNET </p><p>APPEAR TO BE ON THE RISE. IRAN\'S MINISTRY OF POST, </p><p>TELEPHONE, AND TELEGRAPH (MPTT) BEGAN FILTERING THE FIRST </p><p>OF AS MANY AS 15,000 WEBSITES ON 10 MAY, ACCORDING TO </p><p>IRANIAN PRESS. THE FILTERING BEGAN FOLLOWING A DECREE FROM </p><p>IRAN\'S SUPREME CULTURAL REVOLUTION COUNCIL, WHICH FORMED A </p><p>THREE MEMBER PANEL COMPRISED OF THE INTELLIGENCE MINISTRY, </p><p>MINISTRY OF ISLAMIC CULTURE AND GUIDANCE, AND THE NATIONAL </p><p>BROADCASTING AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFY PROHIBITED WEBSITES. </p><p>MINISTER OF THE MPTT, SEYYED AHMAD MO\'TAMEDI, SAID IN MID- </p><p>MAY THE REASON FOR THE FILTERING WAS TO PREVENT ACCESS TO </p><p>IMMORAL SITES AND TO PREVENT THE DISSEMINATION OF ANTI- </p><p>REGIME POLITICAL AND SOCIAL VIEWS VIA THE INTERNET. </p><p>HOWEVER, DURING THE FIRST ROUND OF FILTERING A NUMBER OF </p><p>DOMESTIC- AND FOREIGN-BASED NEWS SITES WERE SHUT DOWN, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE PRESS. INCLUDED AMONG THESE WERE POPULAR </p><p>PRO-REFORM SITES SUCH AS EMROOZ, ASR-E NOW, AND AFTAB; </p><p>SITES ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF IRAN\'S MOST WELL KNOWN </p><p>DISSIDENTS SUCH AS DARIUSH FORUHAR AND AYATOLLAH HOSSEIN </p><p>ALI MONTAZERI; AND SOME WESTERN-BASED PERSIAN LANGUAGE </p><p>SITES INCLUDING RADIO FARDA AND RADIO LIBERTY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DESPITE THE REGIME\'S STEPS TO BLOCK INTERNET ACCESS </p><p>THEIR EFFORTS MAY ULTIMATELY PROVE FUTILE. ACCORDING TO </p><p>SEVERAL STUDENTS AND PROFESSIONALS CONOFF SPOKE WITH IN </p><p>LATE MAY AND JUNE, THE NEW, STRONGER GOVERNMENT FILTERS </p><p>DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH POLITICAL AND NEWS SITES TEHRAN </p><p>VIEWS AS ESPOUSING ANTI-REGIME MESSAGES. MOST INTERVIEWEES </p><p>CITED FEW PROBLEMS IN GAINING ACCESS TO MAJOR NEWS </p><p>WEBSITES, SUCH AS CNN OR BBC, TO VIEW CURRENT INFORMATION </p><p>ON IRAN, WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE INTERVIEWEES, WAS MORE </p><p>IMPORTANT THAN HAVING ACCESS TO DISSIDENT WEB PAGES. IN </p><p>ADDITION, SOME IRANIAN OFFICIALS HAVE QUESTIONED THE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS OF FILTERING, ACCORDING TO THE PRESS. THE </p><p>DEPUTY FOR LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS FOR THE MPTT IN </p><p>LATE MAY SAID THAT CURRENTLY WEBSITES EXIST THAT OFFER A </p><p>WAY AROUND FILTERING AND THE NEW RESTRICTIONS WILL NOT </p><p>PROVIDE A COMPLETE BLOCK OF SITES DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE BY </p><p>THE REGIME. THE INTERNET BUSINESS OWNER OFFERED HIS VIEWS </p><p>ON THE ISSUE, SAYING THAT CENSORSHIP WAS NOT AN ISSUE FOR </p><p>MOST INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY USE FIBER </p><p>OPTIC NETWORK CONNECTIONS THROUGH DUBAI TO LONDON, WHICH TO </p><p>DATE HAVE ESCAPED CENSORSHIP FROM GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. </p><p>THE ONLY PROBLEMS OCCURRED WITH THOSE PROVIDERS RELIANT ON </p><p>SATELLITE CONNECTIONS, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT COULD MORE </p><p>EASILY INTERRUPT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE INTERNET COMPANY OWNER, WHO WORKS BOTH IN IRAN </p><p>AND THE UAE, CHARACTERIZED IRAN\'S COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE AS \'A MESS,\' AND A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO </p><p>FUTURE GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY. HE SAID SERVICE PROVIDERS </p><p>OFFERED ALL TYPES OF SERVICES INCLUDING DIGITAL SERVICE </p><p>LINES (DSL) AND DIAL UP INTERNET CONNECTIONS, BUT OFTEN </p><p>CONNECTIONS WERE UNRELIABLE. HE SAID APPLICATIONS FOR DSL </p><p>CONNECTIONS TAKE UP TO NINE MONTHS FOR INSTALLATION, WHILE </p><p>IN MOST WESTERN COUNTRIES, AND EVEN IN DUBAI, IT TAKES ONLY </p><p>2-4 DAYS. HE SAID THAT MANY NEW BUILDINGS BEING CONSTRUCTED </p><p>IN TEHRAN DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT POTENTIAL INTERNET </p><p>USAGE. USUALLY, A CONTRACTOR WILL ONLY APPLY FOR 40-50 </p><p>CONNECTIONS IN A RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX OF 120 APARTMENTS, </p><p>MEANING ADDITIONAL CONNECTIONS HAVE TO BE INSTALLED. ALL IN </p><p>ALL HE SAID INTERNET SERVICE WAS UNEVEN, BUT THE SECTOR HAD </p><p>POTENTIAL IF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE WOES WERE RESOLVED. THE </p><p>ENGINEER ASSESSED IRAN\'S INFRASTRUCTURE AS "OK" WITH NEW, </p><p>FASTER CONNECTIONS BECOMING AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, PROBLEMS </p><p>REMAINED WITH SMALLER COMPANIES WHOSE SERVERS COULD STILL </p><p>BE EASILY OVERLOADED, LEAVING MOST IRANIANS WITH UNRELIABLE </p><p>SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>CELLULAR COMMUNICATION IN IRAN: BUSY SIGNALS ON THE RISE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE INTERNET COMPANY OWNER ALSO SPOKE ABOUT IRAN\'S </p><p>EXPANDING MOBILE PHONE SECTOR. HE ESTIMATED THAT CURRENTLY </p><p>THERE WERE MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION CELL PHONES IN TEHRAN WITH </p><p>MORE BEING ADDED EVERY DAY. ACCORDING TO IRANIAN PRESS, THE </p><p>MPTT IS UNDERTAKING AN EXPANSION EFFORT NATIONWIDE TO </p><p>INCREASE THE NUMBER OF USERS OF THE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>NETWORK FROM TWO TO FIVE MILLION. THE BUSINESS OWNER </p><p>CONTINUED BY SAYING THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES TO </p><p>DOING BUSINESS WAS THE MONOPOLY ENJOYED BY THE </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OF IRAN (TCI). PRIVATIZATION </p><p>TALKS WERE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY, AND ACCORDING TO AN IRANIAN </p><p>CONSULTANT CONOFF SPOKE WITH IN JUNE, DEPUTY MINISTER FOR </p><p>PROGRAMMING AT THE MPTT, NASROLLAH JAHANGARD, IS </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY SPEARHEADING THE EFFORT TOWARDS A CONCLUSION. </p><p>THE BUSINESS OWNER CONTINUED SAYING THAT TCI WAS COMPETING </p><p>WITH SMALLER COMPANIES, HAVING RECENTLY SLASHED THEIR </p><p>CELLULAR RATES BY UP TO 70 PERCENT, AND WERE LOOKING TO </p><p>QUASH THEIR COMPETITION BEFORE PRIVATIZATION TOOK PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE INTERNET COMPANY OWNER ALSO SPOKE ABOUT THE </p><p>CURRENT BUSINESS LANDSCAPE IN THE TELECOM SECTOR, PROBLEMS </p><p>FACING THE INDUSTRY, AND THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN COMPANIES. </p><p>HE SAID THE PROCESS TO START HIS BUSINESS WAS QUITE SIMPLE. </p><p>IRANIAN BANKS OFFERED FAVORABLE RATES ON BUSINESS LOANS AND </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED NEW TELECOM COMPANIES BY NOT </p><p>REQUIRING THEM TO PAY TAXES. HOWEVER, HE WAS PESSIMISTIC </p><p>ABOUT THE NEXT TWO YEARS BECAUSE THE IRANIAN MARKET WAS </p><p>VIRTUALLY CLOSED AND FEW OPPORTUNITIES EXISTED FOR IRANIAN </p><p>COMPANIES TO EXPAND INTO OVERSEAS MARKETS. ONE MAJOR </p><p>PROBLEM WITHIN THE INDUSTRY WAS POOR PLANNING RELATED TO </p><p>CELL PHONE TOWERS. THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH OF THEM, WHICH IN </p><p>TURN, PROVIDED POOR CONNECTIONS AND NOT ENOUGH COVERAGE FOR </p><p>THE VOLUME OF DEMAND. HE ALSO LAMENTED THE FOREIGN </p><p>COMPETITION IRANIAN COMPANIES HAD TO FACE. CURRENTLY MODELS </p><p>FROM FOREIGN COMPANIES SUCH AS NOKIA AND ERICSSON WERE VERY </p><p>POPULAR, AND COMPANIES FROM CHINA AND KOREA (SAMSUNG) WERE </p><p>DOMINATING THE IRANIAN MARKET. IN ADDITION, EUROPEAN </p><p>MANUFACTURERS SUCH AS NOKIA AND ERICSSON HAD RECENTLY WON A </p><p>CONCESSION FROM TCI TO MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE SIM CARDS </p><p>UNDER THEIR OWN BRAND NAME IN IRAN, GIVING THEM A STRONGER </p><p>PRESENCE WITHIN THE DOMESTIC MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>NO HOLDING BACK THE TIDE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT: IRANIANS ARE DETERMINED TO LEAP INTO THE </p><p>INFORMATION AGE, DESPITE THE REGIME\'S HESITATION, BY FULLY </p><p>EMBRACING MODERN TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE INTERNET AND </p><p>MOBILE PHONES. IRAN IS EXPANDING ITS INTERNET AND MOBILE </p><p>PHONE SYSTEMS WITH THE ONLY OBSTACLE BEING THEIR OWN </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE UPGRADES WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>INVESTMENTS OF MONEY AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO RECTIFY, </p><p>BUT IT CAN BE DONE. CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, APPEAR DETERMINED TO STEM THE FREE </p><p>FLOW OF INFORMATION. THEIR FOCUS IS ON THOSE WEBSITES </p><p>ESPOUSING ALTERNATIVES TO THE CURRENT REGIME, BUT BASED ON </p><p>INTERVIEWEES\' ACCOUNTS THEY ARE FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE. </p><p>TECHNICAL SHORTCOMINGS PREVENT BLOCKING "PROHIBITED" SITES </p><p>ENTIRELY, AND MOST IRANIANS CONOFF SPOKE WITH ARE GETTING </p><p>THE NEWS THEY WANT DESPITE TEHRAN\'S EFFORTS. TEHRAN COULD </p><p>EXPAND FILTERING TO INCLUDE MAINSTREAM DOMESTIC AND </p><p>WESTERN-BASED MEDIA SITES OR PROHIBIT INTERNET ACCESS ALL </p><p>TOGETHER. HOWEVER, SUCH STEPS WOULD LIKELY ENGENDER A </p><p>BACKLASH FROM INTELLECTUALS, STUDENTS, AND OTHER MIDDLE- TO </p><p>UPPER-CLASS IRANIANS WHO HAVE COME TO SEE MODERN </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS METHODS AS CENTRAL TO DAILY LIFE. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LANCIA </p><p></p></div>
