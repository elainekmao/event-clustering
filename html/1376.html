THE ALREADY </p><p>DECIMATED LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO ALMOST </p><p>NOTHING DURING THE WAR WHICH BEGAN IN 1998.  THE MILITARY </p><p>COURT CONTINUES TO TRY CIVIL CASES. </p><p> </p><p>D.  THE GDRC MADE NO STATEMENTS IN 2000 REGARDING TERRORIST </p><p>INCIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>E.

SINCE THE 1998 BOMBINGS IN NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM, THE </p><p>EMBASSY HAS ASKED PERMISSION FROM THE GDRC TO CLOSE THE ROAD </p><p>IN FRONT OF THE CHANCERY TO INCREASE OUR SETBACK.  WHILE THE </p><p>GDRC HAS AGREED IN PRINCIPLE, WE HAVE THUS FAR BEEN UNABLE TO </p><p>OBTAIN OFFICIAL AUTHORIZATION TO DIVERT AND CLOSE THE ROAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
