(U)  The following includes the full text of the V-1 human </p><p>rights report as amended by Post.  We know and did not ignore </p><p> reftel request that post only send the text of responses </p><p>keyed to the questions/comments contained in the V-1.  We </p><p>have answered these questions to the best of our ability and </p><p>resources. However, due to the number of questions and </p><p>because of the additional significant edits and changes to </p><p>the V-1 text that were required to ensure its accuracy, it is </p><p>necessary to send the entire text.  To assist Washington in </p><p>following the changes that post has made, we have also </p><p>emailed a "tracked" version of the document. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Begin Text of Report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria is a federal republic composed of 36 states and a </p><p>capital territory, with an elected president and a bicameral </p><p>legislature.  On May 29, 1999, President Olusegun Obasanjo of </p><p>the Peoples Democratic Party was inaugurated to a 4-year term </p><p>after winning elections in February 1999 that were marred by </p><p>fraud and irregularities perpetrated by all contesting </p><p>parties.  However, most observers agreed the elections </p><p>reflected the will of the majority of voters.  These </p><p>elections marked the end of 16 years of military-led regimes. </p><p> The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary; </p><p>however, in practice the judicial branch remains susceptible </p><p>to executive and legislative branch pressure, is influenced </p><p>by political leaders at both the state and federal levels, </p><p>and suffers from corruption and inefficiency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Nigeria Police Force (NPF) is tasked with law </p><p>enforcement.  The Constitution prohibits local and state </p><p>police forces.  Internal security is the duty of the State </p><p>Security Service (SSS).  "Rapid Response Teams" remained </p><p>intact in most states.  Staffed by police, these teams had a </p><p>reduced role and a less menacing presence than in previous </p><p>years.  Due to the inability of the police to stem severe </p><p>communal violence on repeated occasions, The Government\'s </p><p>reliance on the army to quell internal disorder increased </p><p>during the year. Members of the security forces, including </p><p>the police, anticrime squads, and the armed forces committed </p><p>serious human rights abuses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The economy, which had been in decline for much of the last </p><p>three decades, recorded modest growth of 3.8 percent during </p><p>2001.  Further economic growth has been impeded by the </p><p>long-standing problems of a dilapidated infrastructure, </p><p>corruption and general economic mismanagement.   Most of the </p><p>population of approximately 120 million was rural and engaged </p><p>in small-scale agriculture.  The agricultural sector employed </p><p>over 65 percent of the work force but accounted for only 36 </p><p>percent of gross domestic product. The agriculture and </p><p>manufacturing sectors deteriorated considerably during the </p><p>oil boom decades and years of military rule.  The collapse of </p><p>market agriculture contributed significantly to the country\'s </p><p>urbanization and increased unemployment.  Recorded gross </p><p>domestic product was $285 (N31,426) but the great bulk of </p><p>economic activity is outside the formal sector. Due to </p><p>corruption, nontransparent government contracting practices </p><p>and structural inadequacies, much of the nation\'s wealth </p><p>continued to be concentrated in the hands of a small elite. </p><p>During the year, petroleum accounted for over 98 percent of </p><p>the country\'s export revenues, most of the government\'s </p><p>revenues, and almost all foreign investment. The country\'s </p><p>ports and roads are in disrepair while water and power </p><p>infrastructures are inadequate to meet demand.  However, the </p><p>Federal Government and various states have begun improving </p><p>infrastructure with some success, such as the privatization </p><p>of NITEL, the auction of two GSM licenses to private </p><p>operators, the rehabilitation of power plants and the move </p><p>towards buy-operate-transfer contracts and independent power </p><p>projects (IPPs). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Chronic fuel shortages, which afflicted the country for </p><p>several years, have been mostly alleviated by the improved </p><p>operation of domestic refineries and the recent move toward </p><p>price deregulation. Food production improved during the year </p><p>due in part to record rainfalls; however, poor transportation </p><p>infrastructure and road closures resulting from an increase </p><p>in inter-communal violence caused much agricultural produce </p><p>to be lost. During 2001, the Government made progress in </p><p>reducing controls on the private sector and increased </p><p>expenditures for key social sectors.  The Government moved to </p><p>deregulate the downstream oil sector, reduced its role in </p><p>private banking institutions, eliminated the </p><p>telecommunications monopoly, and deregulated the domestic </p><p>aviation industry.  Also, Government budget allocations to </p><p>education increased by 13 percent and 6 percent for recurrent </p><p>and capital expenditures respectively.   Allocations for </p><p>health increased by 58 percent and 178 percent for recurrent </p><p>and capital expenditures respectively. Nevertheless, a </p><p>significant percentage of the country\'s population lived in </p><p>poverty and many Nigerians were subject to malnutrition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government\'s human rights record was mixed; although in </p><p>marked improvement over the record of the preceding military </p><p>regimes, there were serious problems and abuses. Civil </p><p>liberties were mostly respected and the everyday behavior of </p><p>security forces was better than under preceding military </p><p>regimes.  However, there were many instances of civilian </p><p>instigated communal violence during the year. The military </p><p>was called on to restore order in several major incidents of </p><p>civil unrest or conflict-- such as Jos, Tafawa Balewa, Kano, </p><p>Warri and in the Tiv-Jukun conflict in Benue, Nasarawa and </p><p>Taraba states -- and in many other occurrences of communal </p><p>violence of lesser magnitude. While deployment of security </p><p>forces may have contained the violence and saved lives in </p><p>many of these instances, the national police, army, and </p><p>security forces committed extrajudicial killings and often </p><p>used excessive force in quelling these episodes of civil </p><p>unrest and violence.  In the year\'s most egregious case, army </p><p>soldiers reportedly killed approximately 200 unarmed </p><p>civilians and destroyed much of the town of Zaki Biam in </p><p>Benue State in apparent retaliation for the killing of 19 </p><p>soldiers. Army, police, and security force officers regularly </p><p>beat protesters, criminal suspects, detainees, and convicted </p><p>prisoners; however, there were no reports of torture of </p><p>political dissidents. The Government continued to take steps </p><p>to curb torture and beating of detainees and prisoners </p><p>Shari\'a courts sentenced persons to harsh punishments </p><p>including amputations and death by stoning.  Two amputation </p><p>sentences were carried out during the year. In September, two </p><p>persons, Mohammed Wada and Adamu Idi, were found guilty of </p><p>theft and sentenced to amputation by a Shari\'a court in </p><p>Katagum, Bauchi State, but the sentences were not carried </p><p>out. No sentences for stoning were implemented. Prison </p><p>conditions were harsh and life threatening, and along with </p><p>the lack of food and medical treatment, contributed to the </p><p>death of numerous inmates.  At different times in the year, </p><p>the Government released several hundred prisoners in an </p><p>attempt to ease prison congestion.  In May 1999, the </p><p>Government repealed the State Security (Detention of Persons) </p><p>Decree of 1984 (Decree 2), which allowed arbitrary detention </p><p>without charge; however, police and security forces continued </p><p>to use arbitrary arrest and detention.  Prolonged pretrial </p><p>detention remains a major problem. The judiciary is subject </p><p>to political influence, and is hampered by corruption and </p><p>inefficiency.  The judicial system often was incapable of </p><p>providing a criminal suspect a speedy, fair trial.  With some </p><p>exceptions, the Government respected freedom of speech and of </p><p>the press. The Government continued to relax its restrictions </p><p>on the rights of freedom of association and assembly.  The </p><p>Government occasionally restricted freedom of movement, </p><p>particularly during periods and in areas of unrest.  Some </p><p>state governments, restricted freedom of religion in certain </p><p>respects.  Expansion of Shari\'a raised tensions in several </p><p>communities and resulted in violence in some instances.  In </p><p>1999 the Government established the Human Rights Violations </p><p>Investigation Panel (HRVIP), to review cases of human rights </p><p>violations since 1966; public hearings before the panel in </p><p>Abuja, Lagos, Kano, and Port Harcourt occurred during the </p><p>year and the Panel\'s report is due in early 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Domestic violence against women remained widespread and some </p><p>forms were sanctioned by traditional, customary, or Shari\'a </p><p>law.  Discrimination against women remained a problem. </p><p>Female genital mutilation (FGM) remained widely practiced, </p><p>and child abuse and child prostitution were common. </p><p>Localized discrimination and violence against religious </p><p>minorities persisted. Ethnic and regional discrimination </p><p>remained widespread and interethnic, religious, and regional </p><p>tensions increased significantly. Thousands of persons were </p><p>killed in various local communal conflicts throughout the </p><p>country.   In June and July, more than 200 people were killed </p><p>in inter-communal clashes in Nasarawa State over access to </p><p>land.  In September, several hundred people, mostly Muslims, </p><p>were killed in Jos.  Also in October, fighting in Kano state </p><p>resulted in the deaths of approximately 100 persons initially </p><p>sparked by local street thugs, the unrest in Kano later took </p><p>on ethnic and religious overtones. Some members of the Ijaw </p><p>ethnic group in the oil-producing Niger Delta region who seek </p><p>greater local autonomy continued to commit serious abuses, </p><p>including killings and kidnappings.  During the year, the </p><p>Government took steps to improve worker rights; however, some </p><p>restrictions continued.  Some persons, including children, </p><p>were subjected to forced labor.  Overall, child labor </p><p>continued to increase.  Trafficking in persons for purposes </p><p>of forced prostitution and forced labor was a problem and </p><p>allegations of government officials\' involvement were </p><p>widespread.  Vigilante violence increased throughout the </p><p>country, particularly in Lagos and Onitsha, where suspected </p><p>criminals were apprehended, beaten, and sometimes killed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During 2001, the Federal Government inaugurated the National </p><p>Action Plan for Human Rights Steering Committee (including </p><p>Ministers of Justice, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, </p><p>Women and Youth Development, Labor, and Senate and House </p><p>Chairmen of the National Assembly Human Rights Committees) </p><p>and Coordinating Committee.  As part of the National Action </p><p>Plan, the Committees will assess and report on human rights </p><p>in Nigeria, and make and implement recommendations to improve </p><p>human rights. </p><p>Respect for Human Rights </p><p>Section 1  Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including </p><p>              Freedom From </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government did not use deadly force to repress </p><p>nonviolent, purely political activities; however, lethal </p><p>force was used when protests or demonstrations were perceived </p><p>as becoming violent or disruptive, or in the apprehension and </p><p>detention of suspected criminals.  As a result, national </p><p>police, army, and security forces committed extrajudicial </p><p>killings and used excessive force to quell civil unrest in </p><p>several incidents during the year. State anticrime task </p><p>forces remained the most frequents human rights offenders. </p><p>However in most cases where abuses were committed, neither </p><p>the state anticrime task forces, the police, nor the armed </p><p>forces were held accountable for excessive, deadly use of </p><p>force or the death of individuals in custody.  They operated </p><p>with impunity in the apprehension, illegal detention, and </p><p>sometimes execution of criminal suspects. Since taking </p><p>office, President Obasanjo has preferred to let the police </p><p>deal with civil disturbances, sending in military </p><p>reinforcements only when the police were unable to restore </p><p>order.  The Government deployed the army numerous times </p><p>during the year to restore order after civil unrest. While </p><p>the army proved capable of restoring order, it was ill </p><p>trained to handle civil unrest and other related police work. </p><p>Due in part to this lack of training,  the military committed </p><p>numerous abuses while performing this role.  Multinational </p><p>oil companies and Nigerian oil producing companies </p><p>subcontract police and soldiers from area units particularly </p><p>to protect the oil facilities in the volatile Niger Delta </p><p>region.  Freelance security forces and former security forces </p><p>accounted for a significant portion of the violent crime </p><p>during the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The police, military, and anticrime taskforce personnel </p><p>committed numerous extrajudicial killings in the apprehension </p><p>and detention of suspected criminals.  Police used deadly </p><p>force against suspected vandals near oil pipelines in the </p><p>Niger Delta Region, against the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) </p><p>vigilante group in Lagos State and, allegedly, against </p><p>participants in the Jos and Kano riots that took place in </p><p>September and October, respectively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In February police reportedly killed 10 persons and destroyed </p><p>the headquarters of the Movement for the Actualization of the </p><p>Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) in Okigwe; several MASSOB </p><p>leaders, including Ralph Uwazuruike, were arrested (see </p><p>Section 1.d.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Also in February, outside the main mosque in Gombe state, </p><p>police killed several persons while dispersing Muslim </p><p>protesters who reportedly were attacking and damaging </p><p>buildings, such as the police barracks.  There were </p><p>unconfirmed reports that police reportedly shot and killed 22 </p><p>detainees who attempted to escape from Jos prison during the </p><p>September disturbances in Jos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> In December, police and members of a militant Islamic group </p><p>clashed when the police attempted to stop the group from </p><p>holding a march in Kano.  Several members of the group were </p><p>killed during the confrontation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were only a few instances where policemen were held to </p><p>account for their abuses.  For example, three policemen in </p><p>Kogi state were sentenced to death in April by hanging after </p><p>being found guilty of theft and murder.  The policemen were </p><p>accused of stopping a car, killing five persons, and stealing </p><p>the passengers\' money.  The sentence had not been carried out </p><p>by year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the year, ethnic and religious tensions increased in </p><p>parts of Nigeria.  The Government often called on the </p><p>military when the tension turned violent. The Government </p><p>deployed the army in Jos in Plateau State to quell a major </p><p>outburst of  ethno-religious violence  that claimed </p><p>approximately 2300 lives before it was ended, in large part </p><p>due to the presence of  the military.  By October, army </p><p>troops were maintaining order in Kaduna, Jos, Tafawa Balewa, </p><p>Kano, and a significant part of eastern Benue, eastern </p><p>Nasarawa and western Taraba states. There were credible </p><p>reports that in some of these deployments, soldiers used </p><p>excessive lethal force while attempting to end the unrest. </p><p>The number of total casualties resulting from the use of </p><p>excessive force by security forces is unknown but most </p><p>sources believe that far fewer lives were lost in suppressing </p><p>the violent outbreaks than were lost during the outbreaks </p><p>themselves. </p><p>However, on October 22 and 23, evidence strongly indicates </p><p>army soldiers killed approximately 200 ethnic Tiv civilians </p><p>and ransacked the town of Zaki Biam In Benue State in </p><p>retaliation for the slaying of 19 soldiers allegedly by </p><p>members of the ethnic Tiv militia. Reportedly, tens of </p><p>thousands fled the area as a result of the violence, adding </p><p>to the number of internally displaced people in that region </p><p>of the country. The Government announced the establishment of </p><p>a commission of inquiry to investigate the killings, but by </p><p>year\'s end the commission had not been inaugurated.   Also in </p><p>October, several hours after the conclusion of a peaceful </p><p>demonstration against U.S. military action in Afghanistan, </p><p>rioting broke out in the largest marketplace in the city of </p><p>Kano. While sparked by street thugs initially, the violence </p><p>later took on religious and ethnic overtones; 100 persons </p><p>were killed and dozens of shops and cars were damaged. </p><p>Finally the army was called out to restore order. Some </p><p>citizens alleged that the army and police used excessive and </p><p>lethal force and that several deaths came at the hands of the </p><p>security forces. In November police reportedly charged more </p><p>than 200 persons in connections with the clashes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>According to Human Rights Watch, soldiers, naval personnel, </p><p>and paramilitary Mobile Police deployed in the oil and gas </p><p>regions of the Niger Delta carry out assaults and other </p><p>abuses on an ongoing basis (see Section 5). According to </p><p>Human Rights Watch, the police shot on sight suspected armed </p><p>robbers, alleged members of ethnic militia, and youths in the </p><p>Niger Delta Region accused of stealing oil and vandalizing </p><p>facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Confrontations between increasingly militant "youths" (who </p><p>tend to be unemployed males between the ages of 16 and 40), </p><p>oil companies, and government authorities continued during </p><p>the year.  In June in the Khana local government area, mobile </p><p>police shot and killed an allegedly unarmed Ogoni man.  In </p><p>July a police officer protecting oil contractors in Bayelsa </p><p>State killed a local youth, reportedly after the youth tried </p><p>to disarm him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Violence and lethal force at police roadblocks and </p><p>checkpoints decreased during the year; however, some </p><p>instances of such violence continued.  In August, the </p><p>Abakaliki police (headquarters for Ebonyi State), killed four </p><p>members of the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) at a </p><p>checkpoint.  The victims included the chairman of the Ishielu </p><p>Local Government, Onyebuhi Eche, Ifeanyi Nnanji, Gbonna </p><p>Odembaigwe and Uche Frank.  During the year, an upsurge in </p><p>violent crime in Lagos led to an increase in the number of </p><p>roadblocks and checkpoints at major intersections, without an </p><p>increase in police misconduct or violence (see Section 2.d.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harsh and life threatening prison conditions and denial of </p><p>proper medical treatment contributed to the death of numerous </p><p>inmates (see Section 1.c.)  Criminal suspects died from </p><p>unnatural causes while in official custody, usually as the </p><p>result of neglect and harsh treatment.  There were reports </p><p>that police killed persons suspected of belonging to the </p><p>Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) if they found ceremonial cuts or </p><p>marking on the detainees\' backs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of any investigation or action taken </p><p>against the police in Lagos, who reportedly killed 509 </p><p>suspected armed robbers and injured 113 robbery suspects, </p><p>during the course of making 3,166 arrests; not all of those </p><p>killed were OPC members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were no developments in the May 2000 alleged killing by </p><p>security forces of a young woman who obstructed the motorcade </p><p>of Lagos Deputy Governor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No action was taken against the members of the security </p><p>forces responsible for killing the persons in the following </p><p>cases from 2000: The August killing of a Nnamdi Azikiwe </p><p>University student; the July killing of 1 person when a </p><p>demonstration was dispersed forcibly; the July killing of 1 </p><p>person when a strike was dispersed forcibly; the June </p><p>killings of 2 persons in Abuja; the June killings of five </p><p>persons for suspected vandalism; April and March killings of </p><p>28 Delta youths near oil flow stations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Human Rights Violations Investigation Panel (HRVIP), also </p><p>known as the Oputa Panel, continued hearings during the year </p><p>into 150 cases of killings by members of the security forces </p><p>(see Section 4.)  The Panel\'s report is expected to be </p><p>released early in 2002. In 2000 the Civil Liberties </p><p>Organization (CLO) (a credible human rights organization) </p><p>filed a petition with the National Human Rights Commission </p><p>and the Oputa Panel concerning the 1999 death in detention of </p><p>Godfrey Opuoru.  Sunday Aghedo, the Lagos state police </p><p>commissioner under whose command the death occurred, was </p><p>replaced by Mike Okiro in 1999.  Despite an order from the </p><p>Oputa Panel to the police to reinvestigate the case, there </p><p>was no evidence they had done so by year\'s end. </p><p>The Government did not address the 1999 leveling of Odi in </p><p>Bayelsa State by federal troops.  The Government did not hold </p><p>accountable any of the officers or soldiers involved in the </p><p>destruction of the town and the killing of several hundred </p><p>inhabitants; there were newspaper reports that some of the </p><p>soldiers were promoted.  Trials against Keniwer Imo Neweigha, </p><p>Monday Diongoli, Timi Epengele, Onoriode David, Ebi Clifford </p><p>Saibu, Derioteidou Aganaba, Timinepre Keren, Joshua </p><p>Godspower, John Zitua, and Benson Odiowei for the alleged </p><p>murders of 12 policemen and 6 civilians that sparked the Odi </p><p>incident, were ongoing at year\'s end.  When the prosecution </p><p>could not produce Odiowei for trial in 2000, the case was </p><p>postponed to a later date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The prosecution of Hamza al-Mustapha, Mohammed Abacha, </p><p>Mohammed Rabo Lawal, Lateef Shofalan, Mohammed Aminu and </p><p>Sergeant Rogers Mshiella for the 1996 murder of Kudirat </p><p>Abiola, a prominent democracy activist and the wife of </p><p>Moshood Abiola, was adjourned repeatedly during the year; </p><p>defense lawyers for each individual had filed numerous </p><p>motions for adjournment in the Lagos High Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 1999 the trial against former Army Chief of Staff Ishaya </p><p>Bamaiyi for the attempted murder in 1996 of Guardian </p><p>newspaper publisher Alex Ibru began.  Hamza al-Mustapha, </p><p>former Lagos Police Commissioner James Danbaba, and Colonel </p><p>Jubrin Bala Yakubu, also were charged in the attempt on Ibru </p><p>but their trials were pending at year\'s end.  All of the </p><p>defendants were being held at Kiri Kiri maximum-security </p><p>prison at year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On August 19, unknown assailants shot and killed Rivers State </p><p>Assemblyman Monday Ndor outside his residence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In December Osun State Lawmaker Odunayo Olagbaju was killed </p><p>in political violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On December 23 in Ibadan, Justice Minister Bola Ige was </p><p>killed in his home in what most believed as a politically </p><p>motivated assassination.  By year\'s end, police reportedly </p><p>detained a 27-year-old man who confessed to being a member of </p><p>an eight-man gang that shot Ige in exchange for $8,960 (1 </p><p>million naira).  The suspect\'s mental state has been </p><p>questioned and he was released. There has been widespread </p><p>speculation that Ige and others were killed in connection </p><p>with the political dispute between the Osun State Governor, </p><p>Bisi Akanda, and Osun State Deputy Governor, Iyiola Omisore. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Anambra State, the state government supported and paid the </p><p>vigilante group known as the Bakassi Boys. Like most </p><p>vigilante groups, the Bakassi Boys killed suspected criminals </p><p>rather than turn them over to police; however, in some cases, </p><p>the Bakassi Boys have chosen to mutilate alleged criminals, </p><p>rather than killing them outright. They also were accused of </p><p>harassing and threatening political opponents of the state </p><p>government.  On May 29, the Bakassi Boys tortured and killed </p><p>between 25 and 36 suspected criminals in Onitsha.  They </p><p>reportedly stabbed them with machetes and knives as </p><p>bystanders cheered; the victims\' bodies were then set on </p><p>fire. In July members of the Bakassi Boys hacked to death </p><p>four suspected armed robbers in Imo state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There also were numerous reports of street mobs apprehending </p><p>and killing suspected criminals.  The practice of </p><p>"necklacing" criminals (placing a gasoline-soaked tire around </p><p>a victim\'s neck or torso and then igniting it, burning the </p><p>victim to death) caught in the act occurred in several </p><p>cities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In early April in Osun State, mobs lynched approximately 12 </p><p>persons accused of making genital organs disappear.  In one </p><p>incident on April 6, a resident reportedly announced that his </p><p>penis had disappeared while members of an Evangelical </p><p>Christian group were preaching door-to-door; an angry mob </p><p>descended on the evangelists and burned eight of them to </p><p>death. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On October 4, 4 persons were killed and 19 were injured </p><p>critically during violent clashes between supporters of the </p><p>All People\'s Party (APP) and People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) </p><p>in Gusau, Zamfara State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition to the incidences of ethno-religious violence in </p><p>Jos, Kano and Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba States, there were </p><p>other incidents were citizens lost their lives due in </p><p>communal fighting. On November 3 and 4, at least 10 persons </p><p>reportedly were killed in Gwantu, Kaduna state.  In this </p><p>instance, the formal institution of a modified form of </p><p>criminal shari\'a law in Kaduna State added to the tension </p><p>long present in a feud between two rival local leaders that </p><p>was the primary spark of the unrest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Taraba State a dispute between Fulani herders and Tiv </p><p>farmers reportedly resulted in eight deaths.  In December, </p><p>competition over land use between ethnic Hausa-Fulani herders </p><p>and ethnic Birom farmers turned violent and resulted in at </p><p>least 30 and perhaps as many as 90 deaths, mainly </p><p>Hausa-Fulani. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Communal violence in the Niger Delta decreased during the </p><p>year, but ethnic rivalries and disputes between local </p><p>communities over resources still led to deadly clashes.  In </p><p>July fighting between the Akaeze and Osso Edda communities in </p><p>Ebonyi State resulted in the deaths of 27 persons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the Kalabari region of Rivers State, between 20 and 100 </p><p>persons were killed in fighting among three Ijaw communities: </p><p>the  Bille and Krakrama. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the east, violent border disputes between Cross River and </p><p>Akwa Ibom states continued during the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Lagos State, the vigilante group known as the OPC clashed </p><p>repeatedly with the police over their protection of Yoruba </p><p>neighborhoods and over political issues. The OPC continued to </p><p>function as a vigilante anti-crime force despite President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s "shoot-on-sight" order issued against them in </p><p>1999.  During the year, there were fewer OPC vigilante </p><p>killings than in previous years, but OPC-related violence did </p><p>occur. On August 16, the OPC reportedly beheaded four </p><p>suspected robbers and set their bodies on fire in Lagos </p><p>state.  The OPC also reportedly crucified a man in the </p><p>Surelere district of Lagos </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In August Ganiyu Adams, a leader of the OPC, was arrested and </p><p>charged in Lagos state with murder and robbery; Adams had </p><p>been wanted by the police since 1999 riots sparked by the </p><p>OPC.  In September, the OPC announced that it would stop its </p><p>vigilante activities. In October, Adams again was arrested </p><p>and charged with murder, stealing, robbery, and illegal </p><p>possession of firearms; on October 30, he was released on $85 </p><p>(20,000 naira) bail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the year, members of student organizations, commonly </p><p>known as cults, occasionally killed students from rival </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Killings carried out by organized gangs of armed robbers </p><p>remained commonplace throughout the year.  A gang of at least </p><p>30 armed robbers reportedly killed 22 residents in the town </p><p>of Awkuzu on July 28, allegedly in retaliation for the </p><p>executions of suspected criminals by the Bakassi Boys earlier </p><p>in the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b. Disappearance </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances </p><p>during the year; however, in 2000 the OPC charged that the </p><p>police were responsible for the disappearance of at least two </p><p>of its members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Members of minority ethnic groups in the oil-producing areas </p><p>kidnapped foreign and local oil company employees to press </p><p>their demands for more redistribution of wealth generated by </p><p>joint ventures with the state-controlled petroleum </p><p>corporation and for specific projects in their areas. In all </p><p>instances the victims were released unharmed after </p><p>negotiations between the captors and the oil firms; the firms </p><p>usually paid ransoms and promised improved conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition to the political rationale for kidnapping, there </p><p>were numerous instances of strictly criminal kidnapping, in </p><p>which the perpetrators\' sole objective was ransom for the </p><p>release of the victims.  During the year, there were a </p><p>greater number of kidnappings by criminals to extort money </p><p>than for "political" reasons.  Some kidnappings, particularly </p><p>in the Delta, appear to have been part of longstanding ethnic </p><p>disputes over resources. Due to limited manpower and </p><p>resources, the police and armed forces rarely were able to </p><p>confront the perpetrators of these acts, especially in the </p><p>volatile Delta region.  A lack of resources prevented </p><p>judicial investigations from taking place so that kidnappings </p><p>routinely were left uninvestigated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment </p><p>   or Punishment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits such abuses, and the law provides </p><p>for punishment for such abuses; however, during the year, </p><p>army, police, and security force officers regularly beat </p><p>protesters, criminal suspects, detainees, and convicted </p><p>prisoners. Police regularly physically mistreated civilians </p><p>in attempts to extort money from them. The law prohibits the </p><p>introduction into trials of evidence obtained through torture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Different versions of criminal Islamic Shari\'a law were in </p><p>place in 12 northern states by year\'s end (see Section 1.e.). </p><p> Shari\'a courts delivered "hadd" sentences such as amputation </p><p>for theft, caning for fornication and public drunkenness, and </p><p>death by stoning.  Appellate courts have yet to decide </p><p>whether any of these punishments constituted "torture or... </p><p>inhuman or degrading treatment" as stipulated in the </p><p>Constitution.  Caning as a punishment under Nigerian common </p><p>law, the Northern Nigerian Penal Code, and Shari\'a law has </p><p>not been challenged successfully in the court system prior to </p><p>the introduction of Shari\'a law as a violation of the cruel </p><p>and inhuman punishment clause in the Constitution.  Stoning </p><p>and amputation also have not been challenged under the </p><p>Constitution.  There were two amputations carried out during </p><p>the year despite a larger number of sentences.  Shari\'a </p><p>courts handed down their first death sentences during the </p><p>year.  As with the common law criminal courts, indigent </p><p>persons without legal representation were more likely to have </p><p>their sentences carried out immediately upon being sentenced </p><p>(there is a period of appeal granted to all accused). The </p><p>Federal Government has instituted a panel of legal scholars </p><p>to draft a uniform Shari\'a criminal statute  to replace </p><p>divergent Shari\'a statutes adopted by the states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In September an Islamic court in Kebbi state sentenced a man </p><p>to be stoned to death for sodomizing a 7-year-old boy (see </p><p>Section 5).  The sentence has not been carried out and he is </p><p>still in custody. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On May 3, Lawal Isa had his right hand amputated in Zamfara </p><p>for stealing three bicycles.  On July 6, the right hand of </p><p>Umaru Aliyu was amputated in Sokoto for the theft of a goat. </p><p>In July a Shari\'a court in Kebbi state sentenced a </p><p>15-year-old boy to amputation of one of his hands for </p><p>stealing $286 (32,000 naira) from a businessman. In August a </p><p>Shari\'a court in Zamfara state sentenced Amina Abdullahi to </p><p>100 lashes for having an extramarital affair. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Bariya Ibrahim Magazu, a 17-year-old girl, was given 100 cane </p><p>strokes in January, following her September 2000 conviction </p><p>of fornication and slander.  She also was sentenced to an </p><p>additional 80 lashes for naming in court but not being able </p><p>to prove paternity of the child; however, the additional 80 </p><p>lashes were not administered.  Prior to the execution of the </p><p>sentence, Baobab, a Nigerian human rights NGO, filed an </p><p>appeal on her behalf. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In Sokoto, Safiya Husseini was convicted of adultery in </p><p>September by a local Shari\'a court which found her pregnancy </p><p>to be conclusive proof of adultery.  She was not married at </p><p>the time of her pregnancy.  Husseini was sentenced to death </p><p>by stoning, but the sentence was not executed by year\'s end </p><p>and has been stayed pending the appeal she filed challenging </p><p>the legal basis for the decision under Islamic law.  Two </p><p>domestic human rights organizations condemned the death </p><p>sentence, and an international NGO asked President Obasanjo </p><p>to intercede in the matter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Shari\'a criminal law does not provide for amputation as the </p><p>punishment for persons convicted of misappropriating public </p><p>funds.  Rather, the faithful are called upon to ostracize </p><p>persons so convicted. </p><p>Hamza Al Mustapha, Muhammed Rabo Lawal, Lateef Shofolahan, </p><p>Mohammed Aminu, Col. Yakubu, Ishaya Bamaiyi, James Danbaba </p><p>and Rogers Mshiella were detained and charged with the 1996 </p><p>attempted murder of Guardian newspaper publisher Alex Ibru; </p><p>however, the case was postponed during most of 2001 after </p><p>Bamaiyi and Mustapha were summoned to appear before the </p><p>HRVIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No action was taken against army personnel responsible for </p><p>rapes and other abuses in Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers states as </p><p>reported in 1999. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After the November 1999 release of Jerry Needam, Editor of </p><p>the Ogoni Star newspaper, the Government representatives </p><p>failed to appear in court for any hearings relating to his </p><p>case.  Police reportedly beat Needam, forced him to sign a </p><p>confession, and did not allow him access to medical treatment </p><p>during his detention in 1999. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In a few instances during the year, Security forces beat and </p><p>detained journalists who made unfavorable news reports.  (see </p><p>Section 2.a.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the numerous ethnic clashes that occurred throughout the </p><p>year (see Sections 1.a. and 5), thousands of persons were </p><p>beaten or injured severely.  Police and security forces, </p><p>failing to respond to these and most other criminal acts in a </p><p>timely manner, were slow to protect civilians caught in </p><p>unrest in Plateau, Kaduna, Kano, Benue states and in other </p><p>areas of Nigeria. Generally, the police lacked the resources </p><p>and training to control criminals and mobs that fomented </p><p>civil unrest. (see Sections 1.a. and 1.b.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On January 1, an Islamic vigilante group known as Hisbah </p><p>reportedly caned in public a Christian trader 80 times after </p><p>he was found with a bottle of gin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The HRVIP or the Oputa Panel heard several cases during the </p><p>year (see Sections 1.a. and 4). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On January 26, seven women of the Ogoni ethnic minority </p><p>appeared before the HRVIP and accused soldiers of the Rivers </p><p>State Internal Security of raping them in 1993 and 1994. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In February Ohaneze Ndigbo, an Igbo cultural organization, </p><p>asked the HRVIP to investigate atrocities, including pogroms, </p><p>genocide, mistreatment of refugees and war prisoners, and </p><p>bombing of civilian targets, allegedly committed against </p><p>Igbos between 1966 and 1970. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prison and detention conditions remained harsh and life </p><p>threatening.  Most prisons were built 70 to 80 years ago and </p><p>lack functioning basic facilities.  Lack of potable water, </p><p>inadequate sewage facilities, and severe overcrowding </p><p>resulted in unhealthy and dangerous sanitary conditions. </p><p>Many prisons held 200 to 300 percent more persons than they </p><p>were designed to hold. The Government acknowledged the </p><p>problem of overcrowding as the main cause of the harsh </p><p>conditions common in the prison system.  According to </p><p>government sources, approximately 45,000 inmates were held in </p><p>a system of 148 prisons (and 83 satellite prisons) with a </p><p>maximum designed capacity of 33,348 prisoners. Some human </p><p>rights groups estimate a higher number of inmates*-perhaps </p><p>as many as 47,000 (see Section 1.d.). Several times in 2000 </p><p>authorities attempted to ease congestion in some smaller </p><p>prisons. For example, in honor of the Eid-El-Kabir in March </p><p>2000, the Governor of Kano State released 159 prisoners, 52 </p><p>of whom were pretrial detainees held without charge.  Those </p><p>released also were provided with travel funds to return to </p><p>their homes. In 2001, the Governor of Kaduna State, on the </p><p>recommendation of a state court judge, made a similar release </p><p>of prisoners.  During March 2001, the Chairman of the </p><p>National Human Rights Commission visited Owerri Prison in Imo </p><p>State.  According to NHRC reporting, 90 percent of those in </p><p>prison were awaiting trial.  Multiple adjournments in some </p><p>cases had led to serious delays.  The NHRC urged the courts, </p><p>Ministry of Justice and the police to hasten the expedition </p><p>of the cases awaiting trial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In December, five teenagers were released from Suleja prison, </p><p>in Niger State, through the help of local NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Disease was pervasive in the cramped, poorly ventilated </p><p>facilities, and chronic shortages of medical supplies were </p><p>reported.  Prison inmates were allowed outside their cells </p><p>for recreation or exercise only irregularly, and many inmates </p><p>had to provide their own food.  Only those with money or </p><p>whose relatives brought food regularly had sufficient food; </p><p>petty corruption among prison officials made it difficult for </p><p>money provided for food to reach prisoners.  Poor inmates </p><p>often relied on handouts from others to survive.  Beds or </p><p>mattresses were not provided to many inmates, forcing them to </p><p>sleep on concrete floors, often without a blanket.  Prison </p><p>officials, police, and security forces often denied inmates </p><p>food and medical treatment as a form of punishment or to </p><p>extort money from them.  Harsh conditions and denial of </p><p>proper medical treatment contributed to the deaths of </p><p>numerous prisoners.  A reputable human rights organization </p><p>estimated in 1999 that at least one inmate died per day in </p><p>the Kiri Kiri prison in Lagos alone.  According to the </p><p>Prisoners Rehabilitation and Welfare Action (PRAWA) a </p><p>nongovernmental organization (NGO), dead inmates promptly are </p><p>buried on the prison compounds, usually without notifying </p><p>their families.  A nationwide estimate of the number of </p><p>inmates who die daily in the country\'s prisons is difficult </p><p>to obtain because of poor record keeping by prison officials. </p><p> PRAWA and other NGO\'s alleged that prison conditions were </p><p>worse in rural areas than in urban districts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In practice women and juveniles are held with male prisoners, </p><p>especially in rural areas.  The extent of abuse in these </p><p>conditions is unknown.  In most case, women who commit minor </p><p>offenses are released on bail, while women who commit major </p><p>offenses are detained.  There is no formalized procedure </p><p>regarding the separation of detainees and convicted </p><p>prisoners.  Rather the method of confinement depends wholly </p><p>on the capacity of the facility.  Therefore, due to space </p><p>constraints detainees are often housed with convicted </p><p>prisoners. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2000 President Obasanjo directed the Ministry of Justice </p><p>to create a judicial administration committee to address the </p><p>questions of overcrowding, prison conditions, and </p><p>rehabilitation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2001, the National Human Rights Commission began working </p><p>with the Ministry of Justice and the Legal Resources </p><p>Consortium to draft a new Prisons Bill to conform with </p><p>minimum standard rules of prisons practice and provisions of </p><p>the United Nations.  The NHRC has also urged the Federal </p><p>Government and police against detaining persons in civil </p><p>cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the year, the Government allowed international and </p><p>domestic NGO\'s, including PRAWA and the International </p><p>Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), regular access to prisons; </p><p>however, it did not allow them continuous access to all </p><p>prisons.  PRAWA and the ICRC publish newsletters on their </p><p>work.  The Government admits that there are problems with its </p><p>incarceration and rehabilitation programs and worked with </p><p>groups such as these to address those problems.  However, </p><p>groups such as Rotary International report difficulties at </p><p>the local level in gaining access to prisons and jails to do </p><p>rehabilitation programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In August local media reported that the Inspector General of </p><p>the police decided to transfer all current members of the </p><p>Lagos-based Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) known as the </p><p>"Scorpions."  Reportedly there had been numerous allegations </p><p>against SARS officers for corruption, including aiding and </p><p>abetting crime groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention; </p><p>however, security forces generally did not observe these </p><p>prohibitions.  Police and security forces continued to use </p><p>arbitrary arrest and detention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Police and security forces were empowered to make arrests </p><p>without warrants if they believed that there was reason to </p><p>suspect that a person had committed an offense; they often </p><p>abused this power.  Under the Fundamental Rights Enforcement </p><p>Procedures Rules of the Constitution, police may arrest and </p><p>detain persons for 24 hours before charging them with an </p><p>offense.  The law requires an arresting officer to inform the </p><p>accused of charges at the time of arrest and to take the </p><p>accused persons to a station for processing within a </p><p>reasonable amount of time.  By law police must provide </p><p>suspects with the opportunity to engage counsel and post </p><p>bail.  However, police generally did not adhere to legally </p><p>mandated procedures.  Suspects routinely were detained </p><p>without being informed of the charges, denied access to </p><p>counsel and family members, and denied the opportunity to </p><p>post bail for bailable offenses.  Detainees often were kept </p><p>incommunicado for long periods of time.  The provision of </p><p>bail was often arbitrary or subject to extra-judicial </p><p>influence.  In many parts of the country, there was no </p><p>functioning system of bail, resulting in many suspects being </p><p>held in investigative detention for sustained periods. </p><p>Numerous suspects alleged that police demanded payment before </p><p>they were taken to court to have their cases heard.  If </p><p>family members attend court proceedings, an additional </p><p>payment often is demanded by police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In August, security agents arrested and detained for 27 days </p><p>without charge Sheik Yakubu Musa, a Katsina-based Islamic </p><p>scholar; the Abuja High Court later ordered his release. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Human Rights Watch reported that the police arrested hundreds </p><p>of MASSOB and detained many without charge; MASSOB leader </p><p>Ralph Uwazuruike was arrested several times during the year. </p><p>In 2000 the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights </p><p>reported that 302 OPC members were arrested following clashes </p><p>with the police in Lagos.  Of those detainees, 95 were </p><p>released in 2000.  The remaining detainees were not able to </p><p>obtain legal representation and either could not make bail or </p><p>were not eligible for bail due to the charges brought against </p><p>them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Security forces temporarily detained journalists in a few </p><p>instances during the year.  (see Section 2.a.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Students in general are no longer singled out for arrest </p><p>because of political activities; however, many students were </p><p>detained during the year for allegedly taking part in cult or </p><p>criminal activities on university campuses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No information was available during the year about the Ogoni </p><p>activists who were arrested in 2000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On March 23, police in Gombe arrested 19 reportedly peaceful </p><p>persons for unlawful assembly (see Section 2.c.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lengthy pretrial detention remained a serious problem. </p><p>According to the Constitution, persons charged with offenses </p><p>have the right to an expeditious trial; however, in practice </p><p>this right was not respected.  Serious backlogs, endemic </p><p>corruption, and undue political influence continued to hamper </p><p>the judicial system (see Section 1.e.).  The </p><p>Controller-General of prisons estimated that two-thirds of </p><p>prisoners are detainees awaiting trial who have not been </p><p>charged (see Section 1.c.). In January the Minister of State </p><p>for Internal Affairs reportedly said that there were 45,000 </p><p>inmates in the Nigerian prison system, 75 percent of who were </p><p>awaiting trial. Many of the pretrial detainees held without </p><p>charge had been detained for periods far longer than the </p><p>maximum allowable sentence for the crimes for which they were </p><p>being held.  Police cited their inability to securely </p><p>transport detainees to trial on scheduled trial dates as one </p><p>reason why so many detainees were denied trial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Persons who happen to be in the vicinity of a crime when </p><p>committed are at times held for interrogation for periods </p><p>ranging from a few hours to several months.  After their </p><p>release, those detained frequently are asked to return </p><p>repeatedly for further questioning.  Police continued the </p><p>practice of placing relatives and friends of wanted suspects </p><p>in detention without criminal charge to induce suspects to </p><p>surrender to arrest. There were reports that Imo state prison </p><p>officials work with some pretrial detainees to blackmail </p><p>those who knowingly or unknowingly purchased stolen goods </p><p>from the detainees.  These persons, usually prominent </p><p>individuals residing in larger cities such as Abuja and </p><p>Lagos, are remanded to Imo state custody and told that they </p><p>also will be prosecuted for the transfer of stolen goods; </p><p>however, if they pay a bribe, they are released as is the </p><p>pretrial detainee who colluded with the prison officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of political detainees during the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2000, Ismaila Gwarzo, the national security advisor to </p><p>former Head of State General Sani Abacha, was placed under </p><p>house arrest without any charges being brought. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits the expulsion of citizens, and the </p><p>Government does not use forced exile.  Many citizens who had </p><p>lived abroad due to fear of persecution under previous </p><p>military regimes continued to return to the country during </p><p>the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>e. Denial of Fair Public Trial </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary; </p><p>however, in practice, the judiciary remained subject to </p><p>executive and legislative branch pressure, was influenced by </p><p>political leaders at both the state and federal levels, and </p><p>suffered from corruption and inefficiency.  Understaffing, </p><p>underfunding, inefficiency, and corruption continued to </p><p>prevent the judiciary from functioning adequately.  Citizens </p><p>encountered long delays and frequent requests from judicial </p><p>officials for small bribes in order to expedite cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the Constitution, the regular court system is composed </p><p>of federal and state trial courts, state appeals courts, the </p><p>Federal Court of Appeal, and the Federal Supreme Court. </p><p>There also are Shari\'a (Islamic) and customary (traditional) </p><p>courts of appeal for each state and for the Federal Capital </p><p>Territory (Abuja).  Courts of the first instance include </p><p>magistrate or district courts, customary or traditional </p><p>courts, Shari\'a courts, and for some specified cases, the </p><p>state high courts.  The nature of the case usually determines </p><p>which court has jurisdiction.  In principle customary and </p><p>Shari\'a courts have jurisdiction only if both plaintiff and </p><p>defendant agree.  However, in practice, preference, fear of </p><p>legal costs, delays, and distance to alternative venues </p><p>encouraged many litigants to choose the customary and Shari\'a </p><p>courts over the regular venues.  Shari\'a courts, which have </p><p>begun to function in 12 northern states, carried out two </p><p>amputations during the year (see Section 1.c.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Criminal justice procedures call for trial within 3 months of </p><p>arraignment for most categories of crimes.  Understaffing of </p><p>the judiciary, inefficient administrative procedures, petty </p><p>extortion, bureaucratic inertia, poor communication between </p><p>police and prison officials, and inadequate transportation </p><p>continued to result in considerable delays, often stretching </p><p>to several years, in bringing suspects to trial (see Section </p><p>1.d.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trials in the regular court system are public and generally </p><p>respect constitutionally protected individual rights in </p><p>criminal cases, including a presumption of innocence, the </p><p>right to be present, to confront witnesses, to present </p><p>evidence, and to be represented by legal counsel.  However, </p><p>there is a widespread perception that judges easily are </p><p>bribed or "settled," and that litigants cannot rely on the </p><p>courts to render impartial judgements.  Most prisoners are </p><p>poor and cannot afford to pay the costs associated with </p><p>moving their trials forward, and as a result they remain in </p><p>prison.  Wealthier defendants employ numerous delaying </p><p>tactics and in many cases used financial inducements to </p><p>persuade judges to grant numerous continuances.  This, and </p><p>similar practices, clogged the court calendar and prevented </p><p>trials from starting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Many courts are understaffed, and personnel underpaid. </p><p>Judges frequently fail to appear for trials, often because </p><p>they are pursuing other means of income.  In addition court </p><p>officials often lack the proper equipment, training, and </p><p>motivation to perform their duties, again due in no small </p><p>part to their inadequate compensation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no legal provisions barring women or other groups </p><p>from testifying in civil court or giving their testimony less </p><p>weight; however, the testimony of women and non-Muslims </p><p>usually is accorded less weight in Shari\'a courts (see </p><p>Section 5). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and </p><p>the Saro-Wiwa family continued to petition President </p><p>Obasanjo, the Minister of Justice, and the Oputa Human Rights </p><p>panel to reverse the verdict of the Auta Tribunal that </p><p>convicted Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni-9 in October 1995. At </p><p>year\'s end, the Government had not responded to the two year </p><p>old appeal to clear the names of Saro-wiwa and the Ogoni </p><p>activists, who were executed by the regime of Sani Abacha in </p><p>November 1995. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of political prisoners. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or </p><p>   Correspondence </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits such actions; however, although </p><p>government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, </p><p>authorities continued at times to infringe on these rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Police and security forces continued the practice of placing </p><p>relatives and friends of wanted suspects in detention without </p><p>criminal charge to induce suspects to surrender to arrest. </p><p>There were calls by human rights groups for the police to end </p><p>the practice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although the expanded Shari\'a laws technically do not apply </p><p>to Christians, the Christian minority, especially in Zamfara </p><p>and Sokoto states, was subjected to many of the social </p><p>provisions of the law, such as the separation of the sexes in </p><p>public transportation vehicles (a law that was repealed after </p><p>only 2 weeks), and in health facilities, the segregation by </p><p>gender of school children, and bans on the selling of alcohol </p><p>(see Section 2.c.).  At least on Christian was punished for </p><p>violating Shari\'a laws (see Section 1.c.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> a.  Freedom of Speech and Press </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the </p><p>press, and the Government generally respected these rights; </p><p>however, there were problems in some areas. </p><p>The Government owns and controls some publications; however, </p><p>there is a large and vibrant private domestic press that </p><p>frequently is critical of the Government.  There are two </p><p>national, government-owned daily newspapers in English, the </p><p>New Nigerian and the Daily Times.  The New Nigerian publishes </p><p>an additional Hausa edition.  Several states own daily or </p><p>weekly newspapers that also are published in English.  They </p><p>tend to be produced poorly, have limited circulation, and </p><p>require large state subsidies to continue operating. By the </p><p>end of 2000, five major daily newspapers, one newsmagazine, </p><p>and several sensational evening newspapers and tabloid </p><p>publications had begun publication.    Two new newspapers </p><p>began publication in 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On May 26, 1999, in the last days of Abubakar regime, Decree </p><p>60 was signed into law and created the Nigerian Press </p><p>Council, which was charged with the enforcement of </p><p>professional ethics and the sanctioning of journalists who </p><p>violated these ethics. The decree, which virtually made </p><p>members of the council employees of the Government, also </p><p>contained a number of provisions inimical to the operation of </p><p>a free press.  Among other provisions, Decree 60 gave the </p><p>Press Council the power to accredit and register journalists </p><p>and the power to suspend journalists from practicing.  Decree </p><p>60 required that publications be registered by the Council </p><p>annually through a system entitled "Documentation of </p><p>Newspapers." The penalties for practicing without meeting the </p><p>Council\'s standards were a fine of $2,200 (250,000 Naira) or </p><p>imprisonment for a term not to exceed 3 years.  The decree </p><p>also empowered the Council to approve a code of professional </p><p>and ethical conduct to guide the press and to ensure </p><p>compliance by journalists.  Under the decree, publishers were </p><p>expected to send a report of the performance of their </p><p>publications to the Council; failure to do so was an offense </p><p>that carried a fine of $900 (100,000 naira).  The Nigerian </p><p>Press Council opened an office and hired staff in Abuja; </p><p>however, it did not take any official action during the year. </p><p> Many journalists believe that the existence of the decree </p><p>and the Council are significant limitations on freedom of the </p><p>press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Editors report that government security officers sometimes </p><p>visit or call to demand information about a story or source; </p><p>however, journalists and editors no longer fear suspension or </p><p>imprisonment for their editorial decisions for failing to </p><p>comply with such demands.  State broadcasters and journalists </p><p>remain important tools for civilian governors; these </p><p>officials use the state-owned media to showcase the state\'s </p><p>accomplishments and to promote their own political fortunes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the year, there were a few cases of threats against </p><p>and attacks on the press.  In April, police beat a </p><p>photographer and destroyed the film in his camera when he </p><p>attempted to photograph a suspect leaving the Lagos High </p><p>Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In May, Imo State security personnel raided newsstands where </p><p>they seized and burned publications that carried stories on </p><p>activities of MASSOB, a group advocating revival of the </p><p>Biafran Republic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In June police arrested, detained, and charged with libel </p><p>Nnamdi Onyeuma, editor of weekly magazine Glamour Trends, in </p><p>connection with a story alleging that President Obasanjo </p><p>received a $1 million allowance for each of his many foreign </p><p>trips.  Onyeuma was released on bail awaiting court action at </p><p>year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the year, governors from Kano, Imo, and Zamfara states </p><p>were involved in disputes with journalists and publicly </p><p>threatened the media.  State governments also have threatened </p><p>and detained journalists who have criticized their policies. </p><p>For example, a journalist temporarily lost his accreditation </p><p>to cover the State House in Imo State because of an article </p><p>critical of the Governor\'s wife. </p><p>Because newspapers and television are relatively expensive </p><p>and literacy levels are low, radio remains the most important </p><p>medium of mass communication and information.  There is a </p><p>national radio broadcaster, the Federal Radio Corporation of </p><p>Nigeria, which broadcasts in English, Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, </p><p>and other languages; 51 state radio stations broadcast in </p><p>English and local languages. There were six private radio </p><p>stations operating during the year.  No new private radio </p><p>licenses were issued during the year by the National </p><p>Broadcasting Commission (NBC), the body responsible for the </p><p>deregulation and monitoring of the broadcast media. Ten </p><p>applications pending from 1999 still were awaiting NBC </p><p>approval at year\'s end. </p><p>International broadcasters, principally the Voice of America </p><p>(VOA) and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), as well as </p><p>Deutsche Welle and others, broadcast in English and Hausa and </p><p>are an important source of news in the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In January police beat, arrested and detained Igha Oghole, a </p><p>journalist with Radio Benue, Makurdi, after he insisted on </p><p>conducting a scheduled interview with the police commissioner </p><p>rather than interviewing his subordinate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Television Station, NTA, is federally owned, </p><p>while 30 states also operate television stations.  There are </p><p>nine privately owned television stations that broadcast </p><p>domestic news and political commentary.  There are two </p><p>private satellite television services.  The law requires </p><p>local television stations to limit programming from other </p><p>countries to 40 percent and restricts the foreign content of </p><p>satellite broadcasting to 20 percent, but the Government does </p><p>not restrict access to, or reception of, international cable </p><p>or satellite television. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NBC threatened to take private television and radio </p><p>stations off the air when the stations refused to pay 2.5 </p><p>percent of their gross income to the NBC; the Independent </p><p>Broadcasters Association of Nigeria (IBAN) challenged the </p><p>fees in court.  In October the Federal Government set the </p><p>annual fee for the broadcasters at $1,300 (N150,000).  During </p><p>the year, the NBC also prevented the commissioning of the </p><p>Here and There television station in Oyo State, ruling that </p><p>the original license had expired.  The NBC also challenged </p><p>expansion plans by African Independent Television (AIT), a </p><p>part of Daar Communications, claiming that AIT\'s global and </p><p>terrestrial licenses do not allow them to act as a network. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While private television and radio broadcasters remained </p><p>economically viable on advertising revenues alone, despite </p><p>the restrictions that the Government imposed on them, </p><p>government-sponsored broadcasters complained that government </p><p>funding and advertising were inadequate for their needs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since the 1999 elections, foreign journalists who sought to </p><p>enter the country to cover political developments generally </p><p>have been able to obtain visas, and many of the obstacles </p><p>that previously frustrated foreign journalists were removed. </p><p>Officials within the Ministry of Information became more </p><p>accommodating to requests from foreign journalists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government did not restrict Internet access, although </p><p>unreliable and costly telephone service limited access and </p><p>hindered service providers.  NITEL, the Nigerian PTT, </p><p>competed with dozens of privately owned Internet service </p><p>providers (ISP\'s).  All other ISP\'s were owned privately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government continued to take concrete steps to address </p><p>the problems in the education sector and to restore academic </p><p>freedom.  In 1999 Obasanjo approved the establishment of four </p><p>new private universities, but the quality of secondary </p><p>education generally remained low. Student groups alleged that </p><p>numerous strikes, inadequate facilities, and the rise of </p><p>cultism (or gangs) on campuses continue to hamper educational </p><p>progress.  On several occasions during the year, protests by </p><p>students resulted in harassment and arrest by police forces. </p><p>(See Section 1.d.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly, and the </p><p>Government generally respected this right, although some </p><p>limits remained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government continued to nominally require organizers of </p><p>outdoor public functions to apply for permits, although both </p><p>government authorities and those assembling often ignored </p><p>this requirement.  The Government retained legal provisions </p><p>banning gatherings whose political, ethnic, or religious </p><p>content might lead to unrest.  Open-air religious services </p><p>away from places of worship remained prohibited in many </p><p>states due to religious tensions in these parts of the </p><p>country.  For example, various northern states, including </p><p>Plateau, Kano, Zamfara, and Kaduna, banned public gatherings </p><p>immediately following periods of unrest, but they did so in </p><p>consultation with a number of religious and traditional </p><p>groups, and local governments in order to prevent a </p><p>recurrence of unrest. In September Kaduna state government </p><p>extended its ban on processions, rallies, demonstrations, and </p><p>meetings in public places in order to prevent repetition of </p><p>the violence that followed the announcement of the enactment </p><p>of Shari\'a law in 2000 (see Sections 1.a. and 2.c.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In September a political rally in Zamfara State turned </p><p>violent, prompting a temporary ban on public political </p><p>rallies in the state.  On October 31, the Ondo state </p><p>government banned open-air religious meetings by both </p><p>Christians and Muslims in a bid to prevent religious violence </p><p>(see Section 5). In October, a security forces committee </p><p>banned all political, cultural, and religious meetings in </p><p>Plateau state following ethno-religious clashes in the Jos, </p><p>the state capital (see Section 5). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In December in Rivers State, police dispersed a rally of the </p><p>National Youth Council of Ogoni People because the group </p><p>reportedly had not received authorization to hold the </p><p>demonstration.  In October the police banned for security </p><p>reasons a PDP rally scheduled to take place in Sokoto on </p><p>October 4 and 5.  In July the police banned the meeting of a </p><p>group known as the Fourth Dimension, led by former Vice </p><p>President Augustus Aikhomu, because of violence that occurred </p><p>at a prior meeting in Benin City.  In March the Government </p><p>banned a seminar on Islamic law that was planned in Zaria. In </p><p>May police cancelled a planned meeting of southern governors </p><p>in Enugu, reportedly because the meeting was "capable of </p><p>creating disharmony."  Police regularly disrupt meetings of </p><p>the OPC, and maintain a ban on the organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for the right to associate freely </p><p>with other persons in political parties, trade unions, or </p><p>special interest associations, and the Government generally </p><p>respected this right in practice; however, there were </p><p>exceptions.  Although the Constitution allows the free </p><p>formation of political parties, only three parties were </p><p>registered with the INEC.  The Constitution requires parties </p><p>to have membership in two-thirds of the country\'s 36 states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c. Freedom of Religion </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, including </p><p>freedom to change one\'s religion or belief, and freedom to </p><p>manifest and propagate one\'s religion or belief in worship, </p><p>teaching, practice, and observance; however, the Government </p><p>restricted these rights in certain respects. The </p><p>implementation of an expanded version of Shari\'a law in 12 </p><p>northern states continued, which challenged constitutional </p><p>protections for religious freedom and occasionally sparked </p><p>inter-religious violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits state and local governments from </p><p>adopting an official religion; however, some Christians have </p><p>alleged that Islam has been adopted as the de facto state </p><p>religion of several northern states, given the reintroduction </p><p>of Shari\'a criminal law, and the continued use of state </p><p>resources to fund the construction of mosques, the teaching </p><p>of Alkalis (Muslim judges), and pilgrimages to Mecca (Hajj). </p><p>However, state funds also are used to fund Christian </p><p>pilgrimages to Jerusalem.  In general states with a clear </p><p>Christian or Muslim majority explicitly favor the majority </p><p>faith.  There are 36 states in the country; governors have </p><p>autonomy in decision making but derive their resources from </p><p>the federal Government.  Both the federal and state </p><p>governments are involved in religious matters, including the </p><p>regulation of mandatory religious instruction in public </p><p>schools, subsidized construction of churches and mosques, </p><p>state-sponsored participation in the Hajj, and pilgrimages to </p><p>Jerusalem. Approximately half of the population is Muslim, </p><p>about 40 percent Christian, and about 10 percent practice </p><p>traditional indigenous religion or no religion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On November 2, Kaduna state implemented a modified version of </p><p>Shari\'a law.  Islamic punishments are not being incorporated </p><p>into the criminal code in Kaduna, as has happened in several </p><p>other northern states. </p><p>The Constitution provides that states may elect to use </p><p>Islamic (Shari\'a) customary law and courts.  Until the </p><p>reintroduction of criminal Shari\'a by Zamfara State in </p><p>January 2000, the jurisdiction of Shari\'a courts, which are </p><p>part of the regular court system, had been limited to family </p><p>or personal law cases involving Muslims, or to civil disputes </p><p>between Muslims who consent to the courts\' jurisdiction. </p><p>However, the Constitution states that a Shari\'a court of </p><p>appeal may exercise "such other jurisdiction as may be </p><p>conferred upon it by the law of the State."  Some states have </p><p>interpreted this language as granting them the right to </p><p>expand the jurisdiction of existing Shari\'a courts to include </p><p>criminal matters (see Section 1.e.).  In October 1999, </p><p>Zamfara state passed laws establishing Shari\'a courts and </p><p>courts of appeal, and another bill that constituted the </p><p>Shari\'a penal code; the bills took effect on January 27, </p><p>2000.  Zamfara adopted traditional Shari\'a in its entirety, </p><p>with the exception that apostasy was not criminalized.  After </p><p>the adoption of Shari\'a in Zamfara, other northern states </p><p>began to implement forms of expanded Shari\'a.  By year\'s end </p><p>12 northern states had adopted variations of Shari\'a law -- </p><p>Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Niger, Kano, Katsina, Kaduna, Jigawa, </p><p>Yobe, and Bauchi, Borno and Gombe. Adherence to the new </p><p>Shari\'a provisions is compulsory for Muslims in some states </p><p>and optional in others. Previously Shari\'a law had been </p><p>practiced in the north in the areas of personal law, only if </p><p>both litigants agreed to settle their disputes in Shari\'a </p><p>courts.  Elements of Shari\'a also had been present in the </p><p>northern penal code, which had been applicable in the north </p><p>since independence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution also provides that the federal Government is </p><p>to establish a Federal Shari\'a Court of Appeal and Final </p><p>Court of Appeal; however, the Government had not yet </p><p>established such courts by the end of the period covered by </p><p>this report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although religious belief or adherence is not required for </p><p>membership in registered political parties, in May 2001, the </p><p>Zamfara state house assembly suspended for 3 months two of </p><p>its Muslim members, Ibrahim Musa Murai and Abdullahi Majidadi </p><p>Kurya, for not supporting bills introduced by the governor. </p><p>They were accused of not showing full support for a </p><p>compulsory closing of businesses, schools, and hospitals </p><p>during Friday prayers and an enforced zakkat (alms) payment </p><p>to assist the needy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Christian and Islamic groups planning to build new churches </p><p>or mosques are required to register with the Corporate </p><p>Affairs Commission (CAC).  The law requires that such groups </p><p>name a board of trustees, place a notice of the group\'s </p><p>intent to organize in three nationwide newspapers, and send </p><p>trustee information to the CAC.  If no objections are </p><p>received, the group can proceed with its meetings.  This law </p><p>was put into effect to stem the proliferation of new </p><p>buildings in the absence of zoning laws, to resolve legal </p><p>questions arising from disputes over church ownership and </p><p>control, to provide a single registry for government </p><p>reference in the event that compensation is demanded </p><p>following civil disturbances, and to allow for legal </p><p>solemnization of marriages.  The CAC did not deny </p><p>registration to any religious group during the year; however, </p><p>some religious groups experienced delays in obtaining </p><p>permission from local zoning boards to build houses of </p><p>worship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although distribution of religious publications remained </p><p>generally unrestricted, the Government continued to enforce </p><p>lightly a ban on published religious advertisements.  There </p><p>were reports by Christians in Zamfara state that the state </p><p>government restricted the distribution of religious </p><p>(Christian) literature. Similar discrimination against the </p><p>use of state-owned media for Muslim programming was reported </p><p>in the south. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government continued to enforce a ban on the existence of </p><p>religious organizations on campuses of primary schools, </p><p>although individual students retain the right to practice </p><p>their religion in recognized places of worship. According to </p><p>the Constitution, students are not required to receive </p><p>instruction relating to a religion other than their own; </p><p>however, public school students throughout the country were </p><p>subjected to mandatory Islamic or Christian religious </p><p>instruction.  Islamic studies are mandatory in public schools </p><p>in Zamfara and other northern states, to the exclusion of </p><p>Christianity.  State authorities claim that students are </p><p>permitted to decline to attend these classes or to request a </p><p>teacher of their own religion to provide alternative </p><p>instruction; however, in practice the dominant religion of </p><p>the state is taught in the school, and students cannot use </p><p>these other mechanisms.  There are reports that Christianity </p><p>is taught in the same manner in Enugu and Edo states, and </p><p>that Muslim students cannot access Koranic teaching in the </p><p>public schools. During the period covered by this report, </p><p>Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) leaders volunteered to </p><p>place teachers of Christianity in Zamfara and Sokoto state </p><p>schools, where students alleged that they were being forced </p><p>to take courses in Islamic religious knowledge in order to </p><p>graduate.  Governors of both states accepted the offer of </p><p>assistance and stated that they had not been aware of the </p><p>problem; however, CAN did not provide any teachers in either </p><p>state during the year.  They indicated that schools in rural </p><p>areas may not have qualified teachers of Biblical or </p><p>Christian education classes, and that students in such </p><p>schools have a right to opt out of Koranic knowledge classes, </p><p>which otherwise would be required. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits religious discrimination; however, reports </p><p>were common that government officials discriminated against </p><p>persons practicing a religion different from their own, </p><p>notably in hiring or awarding contracts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Christians in the predominantly Muslim northern states also </p><p>alleged that local government officials used zoning </p><p>regulations to stop or slow the establishment of new </p><p>Christian churches.  Officials have responded that many of </p><p>these new churches are being formed in traditionally </p><p>residential neighborhoods that were not zoned for religious </p><p>purposes.  The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) offices </p><p>in Zamfara and Sokoto states alleged that local authorities </p><p>there delayed or denied to Christians certificates of </p><p>occupancy (CO\'s), which are required to show title to land. </p><p>For example, the Catholic Church in Zamfara state has been </p><p>unable to retake possession of a clinic that was confiscated </p><p>during a period of military rule in the 1970\'s.  Renewal of </p><p>the CO for the church building was approved; however, the </p><p>Church has been unable to obtain a CO to reoccupy the clinic </p><p>building and the adjoining land.  Zamfara and Sokoto state </p><p>officials denied that discrimination was behind the cases </p><p>cited by CAN.  State officials said the certification boards </p><p>were dealing with a large backlog of cases for all persons, </p><p>regardless of religious faith. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As the result of ethnic and religious violence related to the </p><p>expansion of Shari\'a criminal law in various states, (see </p><p>Section 5), several state governments banned public </p><p>proselytizing, although it is permitted by the Constitution. </p><p>The Katsina and Plateau state governments enacted and </p><p>maintained a ban on public proselytizing for security </p><p>reasons. Some states relaxed these restrictions informally </p><p>during the reporting period, and allowed some public </p><p>proselytizing by Christians and Muslims.  Missionaries </p><p>reported that law enforcement officials harassed them when </p><p>they proselytized outside of their designated zones. During </p><p>the year, Kaduna maintained a ban, enacted in 2000, on all </p><p>forms of "processions, rallies, demonstrations, and meetings </p><p>in public places."  Such bans were viewed as necessary public </p><p>safety measures after the deaths of thousands in </p><p>predominantly ethno-religious conflicts, sparked in part by </p><p>the expansion of Shari\'a since 2000, in Kaduna, Plateau, </p><p>Kano, Gombe and Bauchi (see Section 5).  On October 31, the </p><p>Ondo state government banned open-air religious meetings by </p><p>both Christians and Muslims in a bid to prevent religious </p><p>violence.  However, large outdoor religious gatherings </p><p>continued to be quite common, especially in the southern part </p><p>of the country.  In November, religious rioting in Osogbo, </p><p>Osun state, reportedly led to at least one death and the </p><p>destruction of several places of worship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Government has tacitly acknowledged the ability </p><p>of states to implement criminal Shari\'a.  However, the </p><p>Federal Government has instituted a committee charged with </p><p>the responsibility to draft uniform Shari\'a criminal and </p><p>procedural laws that could be adopted by all states, instead </p><p>of the current state-drafted statutes that differ in many </p><p>respects (see Section 1.c.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although the expanded Shari\'a does not apply to Christians, </p><p>Christians in some states have been subjected to many of the </p><p>social provisions of the law All Muslims in states that </p><p>expanded Shari\'a to criminal matters are subject to the new </p><p>Shari\'a criminal codes. All cases involving only Muslims must </p><p>be heard by a Shari\'a court.  Other states with Shari\'a law </p><p>still permit Muslims to choose common law courts for criminal </p><p>cases; however, societal pressure forces most Muslims to use </p><p>the Shari\'a court system.  Various human rights groups have </p><p>challenged the constitutionality of criminal Shari\'a, but </p><p>these suits have failed for lack of a plaintiff with adequate </p><p>legal standing. </p><p>In March journalists covering the implementation of Shari\'a </p><p>law in Bauchi state were warned by the governor, Ahmed </p><p>Mu\'azu, that they would be prosecuted if they misrepresented </p><p>the Government\'s position on Shari\'a.  None were arrested for </p><p>this reason by year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A number of states informally sanctioned private vigilante </p><p>Shari\'a enforcement groups. In Zamfara state, Governor Ahmed </p><p>Sani vested the local vigilante group with full powers of </p><p>arrest and prosecution because he believed that the police </p><p>were not enforcing the new Shari\'a laws.  Governor Saminu </p><p>Turaki of Jigawa state also mobilized a statewide Shari\'a </p><p>enforcement committee to arrest, detain, and prosecute Muslim </p><p>offenders.  In April the Katsina Arts and Musicians </p><p>Association wrote to the Katsina House of Assembly protesting </p><p>the arrest and detention of Sirajo Mai Asharalle.  Asharalle </p><p>was arrested by the state-sanctioned Rundunar Adalci </p><p>vigilante group while performing music at a local function, </p><p>but was released soon after his arrest.  The performance of </p><p>music and dancing was banned under the Shari\'a law introduced </p><p>by Katsina state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, </p><p>   Emigration, and Repatriation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides for these rights, and in general, </p><p>the Government respected this right; however, police </p><p>occasionally restricted this right by setting up roadblocks </p><p>and checkpoints and enforcing curfews in areas with civil </p><p>unrest.  For example, in October, a dusk-to-dawn curfew was </p><p>imposed in Makurdi and Gboko, Benue state, following civil </p><p>unrest in the region. Roadblocks and checkpoints routinely </p><p>are used by law enforcement agencies to search for criminals </p><p>and to prevent the transport of  bodies from areas of </p><p>conflict to other parts of the country where their presence </p><p>might instigate retaliatory violence. Security and law </p><p>enforcement officials continued to use excessive force at </p><p>checkpoints and roadblocks and engage in extortion and </p><p>violence (see Sections 1.a. and 1.c.).  Unlike in the </p><p>previous year, there were no reports of government officials </p><p>restricting mass movements of individuals fleeing ethnic </p><p>unrest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Violent clashes between ethnic Hausa and various non-Muslim </p><p>ethnic groups in Jos, Tafawa Balewa, and Kano resulted in the </p><p>imposition of dusk-to-dawn curfews following the deaths of </p><p>numerous persons (see Sections 1.a. and 5).  In September and </p><p>October, Tiv youths set up roadblocks in eastern Benue to </p><p>harass and kill ethnic Jukuns (see Section 1.a.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution also prohibits the denial of exit or entry </p><p>to any citizen, and the Government generally respected this </p><p>law.  Some men take their wives\' and children\'s passports and </p><p>other identification documents with them while traveling </p><p>abroad to prevent their family from leaving the country (see </p><p>Section 5).  In August General Jeremiah Useni, a retired </p><p>general and former Minister of the Federal Capital </p><p>Territories under the Abacha regime, was prevented from </p><p>traveling outside Nigeria and his passport was confiscated; </p><p>the Federal Government provided no reason for this action, </p><p>but it was widely assumed to be related to allegations of </p><p>corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prominent human rights and prodemocracy activists who fled </p><p>the country during the regime of General Sani Abacha </p><p>continued to return to the country as did many economic </p><p>refugees.  There were no reports that the Government denied </p><p>passports to political figures or journalists or interrogated </p><p>citizens who were issued visas to foreign countries; however, </p><p>there have been sporadic but unsubstantiated reports that </p><p>persons still were questioned upon entry or exit to the </p><p>country at Murtala Muhammed International Airport. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During periods of civil unrest, numerous persons were </p><p>displaced from their places of residence.  In late June and </p><p>early July  several thousand Hausa families fled Tafawa </p><p>Balewa in southern Bauchi state, following violent attacks by </p><p>the majority Sayawa ethnic group; according to the ICRC, </p><p>approximately 20,000 fled their homes, and several dozen may </p><p>have been killed. In September approximately 15,000 persons </p><p>were displaced by interethnic violence in Jos. In September </p><p>and October, thousands of persons from all ethnic groups fled </p><p>violence in Tafawa Balewa and Kano and approximately several </p><p>hundred thousand persons were displaced due to ethnic </p><p>conflict in Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa States (see Section </p><p>2.c.)  In October following civil unrest in Kano, many Igbo </p><p>and Yoruba residents sent their families south.  (see </p><p>Sections 1.a. and 5).  Many persons fleeing civil unrest </p><p>first shelter and safety at military barracks, police </p><p>compounds, and other public places.  Some were still living </p><p>in such government buildings at the end of 2001. Thousands of </p><p>persons, both Christian and Muslim, were displaced internally </p><p>following the Kaduna riots in 2000; most returned to their </p><p>homes during the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Many returnees remained apprehensive about continuing to work </p><p>in these areas, with some returning only to finish business </p><p>contracts or to sell their homes in order to arrange a more </p><p>permanent departure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few hundred residents of the Odi village, razed by soldiers </p><p>in 1999, have returned to the area; however the Federal </p><p>Government has not provided them with assistance to </p><p>reconstruct their village (see Section 1.a.). </p><p>The law provides for the granting of refugee and asylum </p><p>status in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention Relating to </p><p>the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.  The Government </p><p>cooperated with the Lagos office of the UN High Commissioner </p><p>for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian agencies in </p><p>assisting refugees through the National Commission for </p><p>Refugees and its Federal Commissioner.  The Eligibility </p><p>Committee, which governs the granting of refugee status, </p><p>asylum, and resettlement, reviews refugee and resettlement </p><p>applications.  A representative from the UNHCR participates </p><p>in this committee.  The issue of the provision of first </p><p>asylum has not arisen since the establishment of the National </p><p>Commission for Refugees under Decree 52. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At year\'s end, there were 6,933 recognized refugees: 13 from </p><p>Angola; 23 from Benin; 4 from Cameroon; 1,703 from Sierra </p><p>Leone; 3,194 from Chad; 74 from Sudan; 1,561 from Liberia; 69 </p><p>from Cote d\'Ivoire; and 292 from other countries. The </p><p>Government also resettled in the country 3 Cameroonians, 3 </p><p>Chadians, 5 Sudanese, 13 Liberians, and 17 persons from other </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a </p><p>country where they feared persecution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens </p><p> to Change Their Government </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides citizens the right to change their </p><p>government peacefully through periodic, free, and fair </p><p>elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Citizens </p><p>exercised this right in national elections for president and </p><p>the National Assembly in February 1999. The President, Vice </p><p>President, and other national and state officials serve </p><p>4-year terms.  The next state and national elections are </p><p>scheduled for 2003, while local government elections are </p><p>scheduled for 2002. However, the local government elections </p><p>may move to 2003 due to the passage of a controversial </p><p>electoral law in December. The INEC is working with several </p><p>international electoral assistance organizations to help </p><p>improve the process in 2003.  No INEC officials have faced </p><p>disciplinary action as result of their alleged involvement in </p><p>corrupt activities that marred the 1999 elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution outlaws the seizure of the Government by </p><p>force and contains provisions for the removal of the </p><p>President, Vice President, ministers, legislators, and state </p><p>government officials for gross misconduct or medical reasons. </p><p>Early in the year, there was an unsuccessful attempt to </p><p>remove Speaker Ghali Na\'abba allegedly led by members of the </p><p>executive branch. Evidence of widespread fraud and corruption </p><p>in the attempt to buy votes for the removal of Na\'abba forced </p><p>the abandonment of the effort to remove the speaker. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The political system remains in transition.  The three </p><p>branches of the Government acted somewhat independently. </p><p>Despite his party\'s substantial majority in the legislature, </p><p>the President was not able to exercise authority without </p><p>legislative oversight and inclusiveness. The Senate and the </p><p>House of Representatives took legislative responsibilities </p><p>such as budget review and oversight, the election reform </p><p>initiative, and resource allocation seriously.  Obasanjo </p><p>created several commissions to investigate past government </p><p>contracts and human rights abuses, which were overwhelmed </p><p>with applications to present evidence of wrongdoing (see </p><p>Section 4).  However, the judicial branch remained weakened </p><p>by years of neglect and politicization (see Section 1.e.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution was promulgated on May 5, 1999.  The </p><p>constitution-writing process was criticized for not being </p><p>open to enough participants and for not being subjected to </p><p>wider debate on the country\'s federal structure, revenue </p><p>allocation and power-sharing formulas, and minority ethnic </p><p>groups\' rights.  Complaints about the Constitution persisted </p><p>and there were continued calls for a national conference to </p><p>reexamine the constitutional and political structure of </p><p>Nigeria.  While there were many different conceptions of what </p><p>such a conference would involve, those in the southwest </p><p>tended to favor a "sovereign" national conference, which </p><p>would modify the existing constitution to implement a more </p><p>decentralized structure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In early December the President signed an electoral law that </p><p>moved local elections from 2002 to 2003.  This provision was </p><p>contested by the state governors and state assemblies as an </p><p>infringement on the states constitutional powers to control </p><p>local government.  While allowing new political parties to </p><p>participate in local elections in 2003, the act prohibited </p><p>them from from participation in state and national elections </p><p>until 2007.   After weeks of public debate, both Houses of </p><p>the National Assembly repealed the prohibition against new </p><p>parties participating in the 2003 national and state </p><p>elections. The  constitutionality of the law and how it was </p><p>amended was also the subject of a suit  before the Supreme </p><p>Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The percentage of women in government and politics does not </p><p>correspond to their percentage of the population; however, </p><p>there were no legal impediments to political participation or </p><p>voting by women. Men continued to dominate the political </p><p>arena and NGO\'s continued to protest the limited </p><p>representation of women in the political process.  Out of </p><p>more than 500 ministerial and National Assembly positions, </p><p>there are only six female ministers, three female Senators </p><p>and 12 female Representatives.  Women\'s rights groups lobbied </p><p>local, state, and the Federal Government (and local levels as </p><p>well) to adopt a 30 percent affirmative action program; </p><p>however, these efforts were unsuccessful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no legal impediments to participation in government </p><p>by members of any ethnic group.  The Constitution requires </p><p>that government appointments reflect the country\'s "federal </p><p>character."  However, there are more than 250 ethnic groups, </p><p>and it is difficult to insure representation of every group </p><p>in the Government (see Section 5).  The federal- and </p><p>state-level ministers generally are selected to represent the </p><p>country\'s and state\'s regional, ethnic, and religious makeup. </p><p> President Obasanjo has attempted to create an ethnically </p><p>inclusive Government.  Despite this effort, many groups </p><p>complained of insufficient representation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Middle-belt and Christian officers dominate the military </p><p>hierarchy.  In 1999 Obasanjo retired all military officers </p><p>who held political office, which meant that a </p><p>disproportionate number of northern Hausa officers--who </p><p>dominated the upper ranks under the previous military </p><p>regimes--left the service.  In 2000 there were few military </p><p>retirements, and although they appear to reflect an ethnic or </p><p>religious bias, some in the north believe that the northern </p><p>Hausa are underrepresented in the military. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and </p><p>             Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged </p><p>Violations </p><p>             of Human Rights </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A number of domestic and international human rights groups </p><p>generally operate without government restriction, </p><p>investigating and publishing their findings on human rights </p><p>cases.  Government officials are generally cooperative and </p><p>responsive to their views. Criticisms of the Government\'s </p><p>past human rights record were abundant in various media. </p><p>High-level government officials noted that the human rights </p><p>community assisted in the advancement of democracy.  However, </p><p>in 2001, human rights activists complained that President </p><p>Obasanjo and members of his government did not meet with them </p><p>as frequently as in the previous year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Catholic Secretariat, a local faith-based interest group, </p><p>continued to hold a monthly open forum in Lagos on various </p><p>subjects relating to past and present human rights issues. </p><p>Discussion panels have included a number of NGO\'s, media, and </p><p>religious leaders.  Each session ended with recommendations </p><p>to the Government on how best to resolve these issues.  The </p><p>Government had not responded to any of these recommendations </p><p>by year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In February the Kano Council of Ullamas declared Kano off </p><p>limits to NGO\'s after a mob set fire to a truck that hisbah </p><p>(Islamic law enforcers) prevented from entering Kano (see </p><p>Section 2.d.).  The Ulamas lack secular authority, and NGOs </p><p>continue to operate freely in Kano. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On October 29, the CRP called on President Obasanjo to take </p><p>responsibility for recent retaliatory attacks by the army </p><p>against Tiv communities in central Benue State (see Section </p><p>1.a.). A number of groups spoke out against the events in </p><p>Benue, and called for full investigations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The ICRC is active, with offices in Abuja and Lagos under the </p><p>direction of a regional delegate.  Its primary human rights </p><p>activities during the year involved the training of prison </p><p>officials on human rights, sanitation, and prisoner health </p><p>(see Section 1.c.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is tasked with </p><p>monitoring and protecting human rights in the country, </p><p>enjoyed greater recognition by and coordination with NGO\'s, </p><p>and worked hard to establish its credibility as an </p><p>independent monitoring body.  The NHRC is chaired by retired </p><p>Justice Uche Omo and includes 15 other members.  The NHRC was </p><p>establishing zonal affiliates in each of the countries six </p><p>political regions during the year.  The NHRC is supposed to </p><p>work closely with NGO\'s that are devoted to human rights </p><p>issues.  Since its inception, the NHRC has been denied </p><p>adequate funding to do its job properly.  At year\'s end, the </p><p>NHRC had created a strategic work plan through 2002, </p><p>inaugurated steering and coordinating committees for the </p><p>national action plan.  During the year, it assisted in </p><p>appealing a number of Shari\'a verdicts in the north (see </p><p>Sections 1.c. and 1.e.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The HRVIP, commonly known as the Oputa panel, is a one-time </p><p>panel that was established in 1999 by President Obasanjo to </p><p>investigate human rights abuses dating back to 1966 and the </p><p>time of the first military coup.  The Oputa Panel can </p><p>recommend courses of action to the justice system for </p><p>perpetrators of past abuses, something the NHRC does not do. </p><p>According to Justice Oputa, the chair, the panel\'s primary </p><p>goal is to provide the country with a systematic examination </p><p>of past human rights abuses to develop a national consensus </p><p>on the boundaries of acceptable behavior by government </p><p>entities as well as individuals.  The panel heard cases </p><p>throughout the year, mostly involving allegations of unlawful </p><p>arrest, detention, and torture as far back as the 1966 </p><p>Biafran War (see Sections 1.a. and 1.c.)  The panel also </p><p>heard cases in which the rights of groups were violated.  The </p><p>Oputa Panel held extensive hearings in Lagos, Abuja, Port </p><p>Harcourt, and Kano during the year, and has taken evidence in </p><p>the claims of more than 10,000 petitioners. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On January 20, according to newspaper reports, HRVIP Chairman </p><p>Justice Chukwudifu Oputa apologized to the Ogoni ethnic </p><p>minority on behalf of the Government for events in recent </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In September President Obasanjo appeared before the panel to </p><p>explain his role in army actions during his tenure as </p><p>military head of state in the late 1970\'s.  The family of </p><p>late musician Fela Kuti claimed that Obasanjo was involved in </p><p>a 1979 army raid in which Kuti\'s mother was killed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the year, former Heads of State, General Ibrahim </p><p>Babangida, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, and General </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari refused to appear to answer questions about </p><p>human rights abuses under their respective regimes. The Panel </p><p>concluded its hearings and began drafting a report of its </p><p>findings, expected to be released in early 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, </p><p> Disability, Language, or Social Status </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides citizens with the right to freedom </p><p>from discrimination based on "community, place of origin, </p><p>ethnic group, sex, religion, or political opinion." However, </p><p>customary and religious discrimination against women </p><p>persisted, occasional religious violence was a problem, </p><p>social discrimination on the basis of both religion and </p><p>ethnicity remained widespread, and ethnic and regional </p><p>tensions continued to contribute to serious violence both </p><p>between groups of citizens and between citizens and the </p><p>security forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Women </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Domestic violence is a problem.  Reports of spousal abuse are </p><p>common, especially wife beating.  Police normally do not </p><p>intervene in domestic disputes, which seldom are discussed </p><p>publicly.  The Penal Code permits husbands to use physical </p><p>means to chastise their wives as long as it does not result </p><p>in "grievous harm," which is defined as loss of sight, </p><p>hearing, power of speech, facial disfigurement, or other life </p><p>threatening injuries.  A women\'s rights group has estimated </p><p>that spousal abuse occurs in 20 percent of adult </p><p>relationships.  In more traditional areas of the country, </p><p>courts and police are reluctant to intervene to protect women </p><p>who accuse their husbands formally if the level of alleged </p><p>abuse does not exceed customary norms in the areas.  Rape and </p><p>sexual harassment continue to be problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Government publicly opposes female genital </p><p>mutilation (FGM), which is condemned widely by international </p><p>health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological </p><p>health; however, it has taken no legal action to curb the </p><p>practice.  There was a bill to ban FGM before the National </p><p>Assembly at year\'s end. Because of the considerable problems </p><p>that anti-FGM groups faced at the federal level, most are </p><p>refocusing their energies to combat FGM at the state and </p><p>local government area (LGA) level.  In 2000 Edo, Ogun, Cross </p><p>River, Osun, Rivers, and Bayelsa states banned FGM.  In Edo </p><p>state, the punishment for FGM is a $10 (1,000 naira) fine and </p><p>6 months imprisonment, which is a significant amount in rural </p><p>Nigeria.  In addition once a state legislature criminalizes </p><p>FGM, NGO\'s have found that they must convince the LGA </p><p>authorities that state laws are applicable in their </p><p>districts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Women\'s Centre for Peace and Development (WOPED) </p><p>estimated that at least 50 percent of women undergo FGM. </p><p>Studies conducted by the U.N. Development Systems and the </p><p>World Health Organization estimated the FGM rate at </p><p>approximately 60 percent among the nation\'s female </p><p>population.  However, according to local experts, the actual </p><p>prevalence may be as high as 100 percent in some ethnic </p><p>conclaves in the south.  While practiced in all parts of the </p><p>country, FGM is more predominant in the southern and eastern </p><p>zones.  Women from northern states are less likely to undergo </p><p>FGM; however, those affected are more likely to undergo the </p><p>severe type of FGM known as infibulation.  WOPED believes </p><p>that the practice is perpetuated because of a cultural belief </p><p>that uncircumcised women are promiscuous, unclean, unsuitable </p><p>for marriage, physically undesirable, or potential health </p><p>risks to themselves and their children, especially during </p><p>childbirth.  The National Association of Nigerian Nurses and </p><p>Midwives, The Nigerian Women\'s Association, and the Nigerian </p><p>Medical Association worked to eradicate the practice and to </p><p>train health care workers on the medical effects of FGM; </p><p>however, contact with health care workers remains limited. </p><p>Nevertheless, most observers agree that the number of women </p><p>and girls who are undergoing FGM is declining each year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Indigenous forms of FGM vary from the simple removal of the </p><p>clitoral hood or labia minora to excision of the clitoris and </p><p>the most dangerous form, infibulation.  The age at which </p><p>women and girls are subjected to the practice varies from the </p><p>first week of life until after a woman delivers her first </p><p>child.  The Ministry of Health, women\'s groups, and many </p><p>NGO\'s sponsored public awareness projects to educate </p><p>communities about the health hazards of FGM.  The press </p><p>repeatedly criticized the practice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prostitution is rampant, particularly in urban areas.  A </p><p>number of states have begun to enforce existing laws or to </p><p>introduce new laws to combat prostitution.  All states that </p><p>have adopted Shari\'a have criminalized prostitution (see </p><p>Section 2.c.), and this prohibition is enforced with varying </p><p>degrees of success.  Prostitution is not illegal in Lagos </p><p>state; however, authorities can use statutes that outlaw </p><p>pandering as a justification for arresting prostitutes.  The </p><p>adoption of Shari\'a-based legal systems by northern states </p><p>also has led to the strong enforcement of laws against child </p><p>prostitution (see Section 2.c.).  Southern states, like Edo, </p><p>also are criminalizing prostitution and raising the legal age </p><p>for marriage from 16 to 18. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There is an active market for trafficking in women to Europe, </p><p>and elsewhere (see Section 6.f.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In some parts of the country, women continue to be harassed </p><p>for social and religious reasons.  Purdah, the Islamic </p><p>practice of keeping girls and women in seclusion from men </p><p>outside the family, continued in parts of the far north. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Women also experience considerable discrimination.  There are </p><p>no laws barring women from particular fields of employment; </p><p>however, women often experience discrimination because the </p><p>Government tolerates customary and religious practices that </p><p>adversely affect them.  The Nigerian NGO\'s Coalition </p><p>expressed concern about continued discrimination against </p><p>women in the private sector, particularly in access to </p><p>employment, promotion to higher professional positions, and </p><p>in salary inequality.  There are credible reports that </p><p>several businesses operate with a "get pregnant, get fired" </p><p>policy.  Women remain underrepresented in the formal sector </p><p>but play an active and vital role in the country\'s important </p><p>informal economy.  While the number of women employed in the </p><p>business sector increases every year, women do not receive </p><p>equal pay for equal work and often find it extremely </p><p>difficult to acquire commercial credit or to obtain tax </p><p>deductions or rebates as heads of households.  Unmarried </p><p>women in particular endure many forms of discrimination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While some women have made considerable individual progress, </p><p>both in the academic and business world, women remain </p><p>underprivileged.  Although women are not barred legally from </p><p>owning land, under some customary land tenure systems only </p><p>men can own land, and women can gain access to land only </p><p>through marriage or family.  In addition many customary </p><p>practices do not recognize a women\'s right to inherit her </p><p>husband\'s property, and many widows were rendered destitute </p><p>when their in-laws took virtually all of the deceased </p><p>husband\'s property.  Widows are subjected to unfavorable </p><p>conditions as a result of discriminatory traditional customs </p><p>and economic deprivation.  "Confinement" is the most common </p><p>rite of deprivation to which widows are subjected, and it </p><p>occurs predominately in eastern Nigeria.  Confined widows are </p><p>under restrictions for as long as 1 year and usually are </p><p>required to shave their heads and dress in black.   In other </p><p>areas, a widow is considered a part of her husband\'s </p><p>property, to be "inherited" by his family.  Shari\'a personal </p><p>law protects widows property rights. Polygamy continues to be </p><p>practiced widely among all ethnic groups and among Christians </p><p>as well as Muslims and practitioners of traditional </p><p>persuasions.  Women are required by law to obtain permission </p><p>from a male family member to get a passport (see Section </p><p>2.d.).  The testimony of women is not equal to that of men in </p><p>criminal courts (see Section 1.e.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Women have been affected to varying degrees by the adoption </p><p>of various forms of Shari\'a law in 12 northern states.  In </p><p>Zamfara state, local governments instituted laws requiring </p><p>the separation of Muslim men and women in transportation and </p><p>health care.  In apparent violation of traditional Shari\'a </p><p>jurisprudence, some Alkalis judges denied Shari\'a criminal </p><p>protections to women that they provide to men.  For example, </p><p>a few women were subjected to harsh punishments for </p><p>fornication or adultery based upon the fact of pregnancy, </p><p>while men were not convicted without the requisite number of </p><p>witnesses (see Sections 1.c. and 1.e.).A coalition of women\'s </p><p>rights NGOs in 1998-1999 found inaccurate the Government\'s </p><p>positive portrayal of its implementation of the CEDAW; there </p><p>reportedly was not much progress during 2001 towards </p><p>rectifying the deficiencies identified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On April 4, President Obasanjo initiated a national policy to </p><p>stop all discrimination against women. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Children </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While the Government increased spending on children\'s health </p><p>in recent years, it seldom enforced laws designed to protect </p><p>the rights of children.  Public schools continued to be </p><p>inadequate, and limited facilities precluded access to </p><p>education for many children.  The Constitution calls for the </p><p>Government, "when practical," to provide free, compulsory, </p><p>and universal primary education; however, despite the </p><p>President\'s commitment, compulsory primary education rarely </p><p>was provided. In many parts of Nigeria, girls are </p><p>discriminated against in access to education for social and </p><p>economic reasons.  The literacy rate for men is 58 percent </p><p>but only 41 percent for women.  Rural girls are even more </p><p>disadvantaged than their urban counterparts.  Only 42 percent </p><p>of rural girls are enrolled in school compared with 72 </p><p>percent of urban girls. Many families favor boys over girls </p><p>in deciding which children to enroll in secondary and </p><p>elementary schools.  For the families where economic hardship </p><p>restricts the ability to send girls to school, many girls are </p><p>directed into commercial activities such as trading and </p><p>street vending. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cases of child abuse, abandoned infants, child prostitution, </p><p>and physically harmful child labor practices remained common </p><p>throughout the country (see Sections 6.c and 6.d.).  Although </p><p>the law stipulates that "no child shall be ordered to be </p><p>imprisoned," juvenile offenders are incarcerated routinely </p><p>along with adult criminals.  The Government criticized child </p><p>abuse and neglect, but it did not undertake any significant </p><p>measures to stop customary practices harmful to children (see </p><p>Section 6.f.).  There were credible reports that poor </p><p>families sell their daughters into marriage as a means of </p><p>supplementing their incomes.  Young girls are sometimes </p><p>forced into marriage as soon as they reach puberty, </p><p>regardless of age, in order to prevent the "indecency" </p><p>associated with premarital sex. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FGM is performed commonly on girls in some areas of the </p><p>country (see Section 5, Women). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There was evidence of trafficking in children (see Section </p><p>6.f.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Child labor, including forced child labor, remained a problem </p><p>during the year (see Sections 6.c., 6.d., and 6.f.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Persons with Disabilities </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While the Government called for private business to institute </p><p>policies that ensured fair treatment for persons with </p><p>disabilities, during 2001 it did not enact any laws requiring </p><p>greater accessibility to buildings or public transportation, </p><p>nor did if formulate any policy specifically ensuring the </p><p>right of persons with disabilities to work. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In August the Federal Government established vocational </p><p>training centers in Abuja to provide training to beggars with </p><p>disabilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Religious Minorities </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits religious discrimination; however, there </p><p>were some instances where officials discriminated against </p><p>people practicing religions different than their own in </p><p>hiring practices and in the awarding of state contracts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Religious differences often correspond to regional and ethnic </p><p>differences.  For example, the northern region is </p><p>predominately  Muslim. Many southern ethnic groups are </p><p>predominantly Christian, although the Yoruba are roughly </p><p>fifty percent Muslim. Both Muslims and Christians are found </p><p>in large numbers in the Middle Belt.  In many areas of the </p><p>Middle Belt, Muslim Fulani tend to be pastoralists while the </p><p>Muslim Hausas and most Christian ethnic groups tend more </p><p>toward farming or urban living. Consequently, it is often </p><p>difficult to distinguish religious discrimination and tension </p><p>from economic and land use competition or ethnic and regional </p><p>discrimination.  Religious tensions underscored what were </p><p>predominantly ethnic confrontations throughout the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The crisis in Kaduna in 2000 was the first major </p><p>Muslim-Christian conflict during Obasanjo\'s tenure. Estimates </p><p>of the number of persons killed range from 1,000 to 1,500. </p><p>Following the 2000 violence in Kaduna (see 2000 country </p><p>report), the Government sponsored dialog among the state\'s </p><p>different religious and ethnic groups which helped to </p><p>significantly reduce the level of inter-religious tension and </p><p>violence in 2001.  For example, in October, when two small </p><p>churches caught fire in Kaduna city, Christian and Muslim </p><p>neighbors helped extinguish the fires, and the state </p><p>government promised funds to repair them.  However, in </p><p>November, several people were killed in southern Kaduna state </p><p>due to a rivalry between two local leaders that intensified </p><p>when expanded Shari\'a was formally implemented in the state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In early April in Osun State, mobs lynched 12 visiting </p><p>Evangelical Christians belonging to the Brotherhood of Christ </p><p>(see Section 1.a.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On May 22, Christian and Muslim youths clashed in the town of </p><p>Kumo over the introduction of Shari\'a law; approximately 25 </p><p>persons were injured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In June there were unconfirmed reports that Muslim youths set </p><p>four churches on fire in Dutse, Jigawa state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In November Muslim youths reportedly vandalized eight </p><p>churches in Osogbo, Osun state, and four churches in Ilorin, </p><p>Kwara state; one person reportedly was killed in Osogbo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In early September, 2,300 persons were killed in interethnic </p><p>violence that split along religious lines in Jos.  Between </p><p>10,000 and 15,000 persons were displaced by the violence (see </p><p>Section 2.d).  The appointment of an ethnic Hausa to the </p><p>chairmanship of a local Poverty Alleviation Program increased </p><p>tensions, which accompanied the earlier violence between </p><p>Christian Sayewa and Musim Hausa in Tafawa Balewa, Bauchi, </p><p>only 60 kilometers away.  There also were reports of summary </p><p>executions of Hausa in outlying villages.  Approximately 80 </p><p>percent of the victims in Jos were Hausa Muslims, who </p><p>constitute a significant minority in Jos.  The military was </p><p>able to restore order, but thousands of Hausa fled Plateau </p><p>state for Kaduna, Kano, Jigawa, and Bauchi states.  This </p><p>conflict appears to have been primarily ethnic.  Christians </p><p>of different ethnic groups reportedly attacked each other, </p><p>and Yoruba Muslims joined in targeting their Hausa </p><p>co-religionists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On October 12, 600 to 1,000 Muslims peacefully demonstrated </p><p>in Kano against U.S. and allied air strikes against </p><p>Afghanistan.  Several hours after the demonstration, two </p><p>small churches were burned.  The following morning, a mob of </p><p>predominantly Hausa youth attacked shopkeepers and looted </p><p>shops in city\'s major market.  During the riots, 100 persons </p><p>were killed.  The military was called in to restore order. </p><p>Two churches and three mosques reportedly were burned during </p><p>the fighting.  After order was restored, Governor Kwankwaso </p><p>held a series of meetings with local ethnic and religious </p><p>leaders to stem further outbreaks and to rebuild trust </p><p>between the communities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In November youths vandalized eight churches in Osun state </p><p>and four churches in Ilorin, Kwara state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were no developments in the following 2000 incidents of </p><p>inter-religious violence: 18 persons were killed in the </p><p>Bambam community of southern Gombe state when Christians </p><p>attacked Muslims; approximately 200 persons were killed in </p><p>Nayari, Kaduna state, when Christians rioted after finding </p><p>the body of a person whom they believed to have been a </p><p>Christian killed by Muslims; 1 person was killed in Borno </p><p>state following an argument over the location of a church; 1 </p><p>church was burned and 2 were vandalized in Sokoto following a </p><p>pro-Shari\'a rally by university students. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The country\'s population is ethnically diverse, and consists </p><p>of more than 250 groups, many of which speak distinct primary </p><p>languages and are concentrated geographically.  There is no </p><p>majority ethnic group.  The four largest ethnic groups are </p><p>the Hausa and Fulani of the north, the Yoruba of the </p><p>southwest, and the Igbos of the southeast. The Ijaw of the </p><p>South Delta area are the fifth largest group, followed by the </p><p>Kanuri in the far northeast and Tiv in the Middle Belt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution prohibits ethnic discrimination by the </p><p>Government.  In addition the Constitution mandates that the </p><p>composition of the federal, state, and local governments and </p><p>their agencies, as well as the conduct of their affairs, </p><p>reflect the diverse character of the country in order to </p><p>promote national unity and loyalty.  This provision was </p><p>designed as a safeguard against domination of the Government </p><p>by persons from a few states or ethnic and sectional groups. </p><p>These provisions were included in response to previous </p><p>domination of the Government and the armed forces by </p><p>northerners and Muslims.  The Government is an example of </p><p>this diversity.  Obasanjo is a Yoruba from the southwest, the </p><p>Vice President is a northerner, and the Senate President is </p><p>an Igbo. The Government attempted to balance key positions </p><p>and deputy positions among the different regions and ethnic </p><p>groups. The Senate used its oversight role to reject many of </p><p>Obasanjo\'s ambassadorial appointments and insisted on three </p><p>nominees from each state for each appointment. The political </p><p>parties also engaged in "zoning," the practice of rotating </p><p>positions within the party among the different regions and </p><p>ethnicities to ensure that each region and ethnicity is given </p><p>adequate representation.  Nonetheless, claims of </p><p>marginalization by members of southern minority groups and </p><p>Igbos continued.  The ethnic groups of the Niger Delta, in </p><p>particular, continued their calls for high-level </p><p>representation on petroleum issues and within the security </p><p>forces.  Northern Muslims, who lost previously held positions </p><p>within the military hierarchy, accused the Government of </p><p>favoring Christians from the Middle Belt for those positions. </p><p> Traditional linkages continued to impose considerable </p><p>pressure on individual government officials to favor their </p><p>own ethnic groups for important positions and patronage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Societal discrimination on the basis of ethnicity is </p><p>practiced widely by members of all ethnic groups and is </p><p>evident in private sector hiring patterns, de facto ethnic </p><p>segregation of urban neighborhoods, and a continuing paucity </p><p>of marriages across major ethnic and regional lines.  There </p><p>is a long history of tension among the diverse ethnic groups </p><p>(see Sections 1.a. and 2.c.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were significant interethnic clashes in Delta, Anambra, </p><p>Bauchi, Plateau, Nassarawa, Rivers, Benue, Bayelsa, Akwa </p><p>Ibom, Cross River, and Ebonyi States during the year.  Often </p><p>the competition was between local "indigene" and "immigrant" </p><p>ethnic groups. Thousands of people were killed and injured </p><p>during such fighting (see Sections 1.a.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section 6 Worker Rights </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Right of Association </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution provides all citizens with the right to </p><p>assemble freely and associate with other persons, and to form </p><p>or belong to any trade union or other association for the </p><p>protection of their interests; however, several statutory </p><p>restrictions on the right of association and on trade unions </p><p>remained in effect despite repeals of parts of the </p><p>military-era antilabor decrees.  Only a single central labor </p><p>federation, the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) is legally </p><p>permitted, and the Government recognizes only 29 trade </p><p>unions.  Trade unions must be registered formally by the </p><p>Federal Government, and a minimum of 50 workers is required </p><p>to form a trade union.  Nonmanagement senior staff are </p><p>prevented from joining trade unions, and senior staff </p><p>associations are denied a seat on the National Labor Advisory </p><p>Council (NLAC).  The ILO Committee of Experts repeatedly has </p><p>cited several of these restrictions.  The Government has not </p><p>amended the laws, but it has conducted discussions with </p><p>senior staff associations concerning formal recognition and </p><p>their accession to the NLAC. </p><p>Workers, except members of the armed forces and employees </p><p>designated as essential by the Government, may join trade </p><p>unions.  Essential workers include members of the armed </p><p>forces and government employees in the police, customs, </p><p>immigration, prisons, federal mint, central bank, and </p><p>telecommunications sectors.  Employees working in a </p><p>designated export processing zone (EPZ) may not join a union </p><p>until 10 years after the start-up of the enterprise (see </p><p>Section 6.b.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>According to figures provided by the NLC, total union </p><p>membership is approximately 4 million.  Less than 10 percent </p><p>of the total work force is organized.  With the exception of </p><p>a small number of workers engaged in commercial food </p><p>processing, the agricultural sector, which employs the bulk </p><p>of the work force, is not organized.  The informal sector, </p><p>and small and medium enterprises, largely remain unorganized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since 1978 the Government has mandated a single trade union </p><p>structure with service and industrial unions grouped under </p><p>the NLC.  The trade union movement is composed of two groups </p><p>consisting of junior and senior staff workers.  The single </p><p>trade union structure and segregation of junior from senior </p><p>staff were intended to dilute the bargaining strength of </p><p>workers.  Junior staff workers--primarily blue-collar </p><p>workers--are organized into the 29 industrial unions, which </p><p>are affiliated with the NLC; 21 associations make up the </p><p>Senior Staff Associations of Nigeria (SESCAN), which renamed </p><p>themselves the Trade Union Congress (TUC).  The TUC has a </p><p>claimed membership of approximately 400,000 to 600,000.  The </p><p>TUC, composed primarily of white-collar workers, has not been </p><p>sanctioned officially by the Government, and is prohibited by </p><p>statute from affiliating with the NLC.  While the TUC lacks a </p><p>seat on the NLAC, the Government allowed the TUC to operate </p><p>openly. However, in 1999 SESCAN, now the TUC, began to lay </p><p>the legal and political groundwork to achieve government </p><p>recognition, which will require formal action by the National </p><p>Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In August 2000, the Government decertified the maritime </p><p>workers union on the grounds that the union had not scheduled </p><p>internal elections in accordance with its charter\'s </p><p>requirement. The Government then issued directives requiring </p><p>maritime workers to register with specific contracting firms. </p><p> As a result this historically powerful union was weakened; </p><p>however, it continued to challenge the Government\'s action </p><p>during the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Workers have the right to strike; however, certain essential </p><p>workers are required to provide advance notice of a strike. </p><p>There were several strikes by such personnel during the year. </p><p> In May and June, both doctors and university professors went </p><p>on strike over wages, working conditions, and government </p><p>investment in infrastructure.  Both strikes were resolved </p><p>following lengthy negotiations with government ministries. </p><p>During the year, the Government committed itself to budgeting </p><p>greater funds for development of the nation\'s health and </p><p>education infrastructures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the year, there were smaller strikes over the </p><p>increased use of contract labor and the lack of indigenous </p><p>workers in management positions in the oil sector, </p><p>particularly in the Niger Delta.  The National Union of </p><p>Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and its senior </p><p>staff counterpart Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff </p><p>Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) particularly are concerned </p><p>about the increasing use of contract labor and the number of </p><p>indigenous workers in management positions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2000 Lagos public sector workers went on strike to protest </p><p>the state government\'s refusal to pay a higher minimum wage. </p><p>A compromise package offered by the state was accepted by the </p><p>workers; however, the local union leadership continued to </p><p>press for more pay at year\'s end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no laws prohibiting retribution against strikers </p><p>and strike leaders, but strikers who believe that they are </p><p>victims of unfair retribution may submit their cases to the </p><p>industrial arbitration panel (IAP), with the approval of the </p><p>Labor Ministry.  Lagos State Government terminated an </p><p>important local union leader in Lagos, ostensibly for </p><p>nonperformance, following an extended strike by state </p><p>government workers.  The IAP\'s decisions are binding on </p><p>parties but may be appealed to the Nigerian Industrial Court </p><p>(NIC).  In practice the decisions of these bodies </p><p>infrequently carry the force of law.  Union representatives </p><p>describe the arbitration process as cumbersome and </p><p>time-consuming, and an ineffective deterrent to retribution </p><p>against strikers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The ILO cited a number of restrictions on freedom of </p><p>association. These include: Requiring all registered labor </p><p>unions to affiliate with a single central labor federation </p><p>(the Nigerian Labor Congress); establishing a minimum of 50 </p><p>workers to form a trade union; providing for the possibility </p><p>of compulsory arbitration; giving the registrar broad powers </p><p>to supervise trade union accounts; and giving the Government </p><p>discretionary power to revoke the certification of a trade </p><p>union due to overriding public interest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The NLC and labor unions are free to affiliate with </p><p>international bodies; however, prior approval from the </p><p>Minister is required.  The NLC has affiliated with the </p><p>Organization of African Trade Unions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The labor laws provide for both the right to organize and the </p><p>right to bargain collectively between management and trade </p><p>unions.  Collective bargaining occurs throughout the public </p><p>sector and the organized private sector.  Complaints of </p><p>antiunion discrimination may be brought to the Ministry of </p><p>Labor for mediation, conciliation, and resolution.  The Labor </p><p>Minister may refer unresolved disputes to the IAP and the NIC </p><p>(see Section 6.a.).  Union officials have questioned the </p><p>effectiveness and independence of the NIC in view of its </p><p>refusal in previous years to resolve various disputes </p><p>stemming from the Government\'s failure to fulfill contract </p><p>provisions for public sector employees.  The NIC was </p><p>reconstituted this year with several new members, including a </p><p>formerly imprisoned trade unionist, Milton Dabibi.  Union </p><p>leaders have criticized the arbitration system\'s dependence </p><p>on the Labor Minister\'s referrals.  The Labor Minister </p><p>typically makes few referrals to the IAP. The IAP and NIC </p><p>were active following the Government\'s appointment of new </p><p>members; however, both suffered from a lack of resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A worker under a collective bargaining agreement may not </p><p>participate in a strike unless his union complied with  the </p><p>requirements of the law, which include provisions for </p><p>mandatory mediation and for referral of the dispute to the </p><p>Government.  The law allows the Government discretion to </p><p>refer the matter to a labor conciliator, arbitration panel, </p><p>board of inquiry, or the National Industrial Court.  The law </p><p>forbids any employer from granting a general wage increase to </p><p>its workers without prior government approval.  However, in </p><p>practice the law does not appear to be enforced effectively; </p><p>strikes, including in the public sector, are widespread (see </p><p>Section 1.a) and private sector wage increases generally are </p><p>not submitted to the Government for prior approval. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government retains broad legal authority over labor </p><p>matters and often intervenes in disputes seen to challenge </p><p>key political or economic objectives.  However, the labor </p><p>movement is increasingly active on issues affecting workers. </p><p>During the year, the NLC spoke out on economic reform, fuel </p><p>price deregulation, privatization, globalization, tariffs, </p><p>corruption, contract workers, and political issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government directed each state administration to </p><p>establish its own salary structure based on its ability to </p><p>pay and in accord with the national minimum wage (see Section </p><p>6.e.).  During the year, many state governments found it </p><p>difficult to pay the approximately $60 (6,500 naira) monthly </p><p>minimum wage to their employees, without massive layoffs or </p><p>the elimination of "ghost workers" who appear on the </p><p>employment rolls but not on the job. </p><p>An EPZ remains under development in Calabar, Cross River </p><p>State, and a second EPZ is planned for Port Harcourt, Rivers </p><p>State.  Workers and employers in such zones are subject to </p><p>national labor laws, which provide for a 10-year amnesty on </p><p>trade unions from the startup of an enterprise.  The law </p><p>provides that there shall be no strikes or lockouts for a </p><p>period of 10 years following the commencement of operations </p><p>within a zone.  In addition the law allows the Export </p><p>Processing Zones Authority to handle the resolution of </p><p>disputes between employers and employees instead of workers\' </p><p>organizations or unions.  The 1992 Export Processing Zones </p><p>Decree has been criticized by The ILO has criticized the law </p><p>for not allowing any unauthorized person to enter any EPZ. </p><p>c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor; however, </p><p>trafficking in women and children for purposes of </p><p>prostitution and forced labor is a problem (see Section </p><p>6.f.), and enforcement of the law is not effective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government does not specifically prohibit forced and </p><p>bonded labor by children; however, the law prohibits forced </p><p>or compulsory labor, a prohibition that extends to children. </p><p>Employment of persons under 18 years of age generally is </p><p>prohibited, except for agriculture and domestic work.  , </p><p>There were occasional reports of forced child labor, </p><p>including child slavery rings operating between Nigeria and </p><p>neighboring countries where children are trafficked to work </p><p>as domestic servants (see Sections 5 and 6.f).  The reports </p><p>suggest that Nigerian children are trafficked to other </p><p>African countries for domestic and agricultural work. </p><p>Children from neighboring countries also are trafficked to </p><p>Nigeria for work as domestic servants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for </p><p>   Employment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The law prohibits employment of children less than 15 years </p><p>of age in commerce and industry and restricts other child </p><p>labor to home-based agricultural or domestic work.  The law </p><p>states that children may not be employed in agricultural or </p><p>domestic work for more than 8 hours per day.  The Decree </p><p>allows the apprenticeship of youths at the age of 13 under </p><p>specific conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economic hardship leads high numbers of children in </p><p>commercial activities aimed at enhancing meager family </p><p>income.  The ILO estimates that upward of 12 million children </p><p>between the ages 10 and 14 (25 percent of all children) are </p><p>employed in some capacity. Children frequently are employed </p><p>as beggars, hawkers, and bus conductors in urban areas.  The </p><p>use of children as domestic servants is common. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Private and government initiatives to stem the growing </p><p>incidence of child employment continue but have been </p><p>ineffective.  UNICEF operates programs that remove young </p><p>girls from the street hawking trade and relocate them to </p><p>informal educational settings.  UNICEF reported that despite </p><p>the narrow focus on young girls, the program only began to </p><p>address the problem during the year.  In conjunction with the </p><p>ILO, the Government formulated a national program of action </p><p>in support of child rights, survival, protection, </p><p>development, and participation.  In August a formal agreement </p><p>establishing the program was signed by the ILO and the Labor </p><p>Ministry; however, the program had not shown any results by </p><p>year\'s end due to logistical problems and changing personnel </p><p>in the Ministry. On October 16 and 17, the Senate Committee </p><p>on Women\'s Affairs and Youth held public hearings to </p><p>investigate child labor, sex trading, and other forms of </p><p>exploitation to which minors are subjected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Labor Ministry has an inspections department whose major </p><p>responsibilities include enforcement of legal provisions </p><p>relating to conditions of work and protection of workers. </p><p>However, there are less than 50 inspectors for the entire </p><p>country, and the Ministry conducts inspections only in the </p><p>formal business sector, in which the incidence of child labor </p><p>is not significant. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>According to an ILO statement in 1998, and data from UNICEF, </p><p>the incidence of trafficking in children for prostitution is </p><p>growing (see Sections 6.c. and 6.f.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>e. Acceptable Conditions of Work </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The law sets a minimum wage, which is reviewed infrequently. </p><p>Private sector minimum wages increased during the year to </p><p>match the 2000 increase in the public sector wage scale; </p><p>however, real private sector wages greatly exceed the minimum </p><p>wage.  In the first half of the year, the national police </p><p>were  not paid for several months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2000 the minimum wage increased to $75 (7,500 naira) per </p><p>month for federal workers and to $55 to $65 (5,000 to 6,500 </p><p>naira) per month for state employees.  Private employers in </p><p>the formal sector track the public sector wage scale.  Along </p><p>with the many allowances that are paid, the increase appears </p><p>sufficient to support a decent standard of living.  However, </p><p>many government agencies were slow to pay the new wage scale, </p><p>and all federal salaries were frozen for 3 months during the </p><p>summer, pending a census of government employees.  Ghost </p><p>workers (who appear on the employment rolls but not on the </p><p>job) remained a significant problem that was not addressed </p><p>fully during the year.  The Government increased federal </p><p>salaries in 2000 without adequate consultations with state </p><p>governments, whose employees demanded similar wages; as a </p><p>result, several state governments maintained that they could </p><p>not afford to pay this wage (see Section 6.b.).  The issue of </p><p>the minimum wage caused several labor disruptions throughout </p><p>the year, and remains unresolved in several states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The law calls for a 40-hour workweek, 2 to 4 weeks annual </p><p>leave, and overtime and holiday pay.  There is no law </p><p>prohibiting excessive compulsory overtime.  The law also </p><p>establishes general health and safety provisions, some of </p><p>which are aimed specifically at young or female workers.  It </p><p>requires that the factory division of the Ministry of Labor </p><p>and Employment inspect factories for compliance with health </p><p>and safety standards; however, this agency is greatly, lacks </p><p>basic resources and training, and consequently neglects </p><p>safety oversight of many enterprises, particularly </p><p>construction sites and other nonfactory work.  The Ministry </p><p>often fails to reimburse inspectors for expenses incurred in </p><p>traveling to inspection sites, and safety oversight of many </p><p>enterprises often is neglected.  The law requires employers </p><p>to compensate injured workers and dependent survivors of </p><p>those killed in industrial accidents.  The Labor Ministry, </p><p>which is charged with enforcement of these laws, has been </p><p>ineffective in identifying violators.  The Government has </p><p>failed to act on various ILO recommendations since 1991 to </p><p>update its program on inspection and accident reporting.  The </p><p>Labor Decree does not provide workers with the right to </p><p>remove themselves from dangerous work situations without loss </p><p>of employment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>f. Trafficking in Persons </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No law makes trafficking in persons a crime.  There is an </p><p>active and growing market for trafficking in women and </p><p>children within the region and to Europe.  The country is a </p><p>source, transit, and destination country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The full nature and scope of the trade remained unknown, but </p><p>immigration and police officials throughout Europe continued </p><p>to report a steady flow of Nigerian women lured and sold into </p><p>prostitution in Europe, particularly Italy, the Netherlands, </p><p>Spain, and the Czech Republic.  Italian authorities deported </p><p>several hundred sex workers to Nigeria during the year. Other </p><p>European countries deported smaller numbers of Nigerian </p><p>trafficking victims.  Nigerian Interpol claimed that some </p><p>women entered the sex trade independently, were not </p><p>controlled by syndicates, and were economically motivated. </p><p>However, Human Rights Watch reported that according women\'s </p><p>rights organizations, hundreds of women migrated to Europe in </p><p>response to job offers as domestic workers or waitresses. </p><p>Upon arrival many were forced into prostitution in order to </p><p>pay off debts.  In addition there is evidence that Nigerian </p><p>crime syndicates may use indebtedness, threats of beatings </p><p>and rape, physical injury to the victim\'s family, arrest, and </p><p>deportation to persuade those forced into sex work from </p><p>attempting to escape or from contacting police and NGO\'s for </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In January there were reports that hundreds of Nigerian girls </p><p>are sold into sexual slavery and trafficked through England. </p><p>The girls reportedly request asylum at British airports and </p><p>are taken into the care of social services or foster care.  A </p><p>few weeks later the girls disappear and reportedly are </p><p>trafficked to European countries, in particular Italy, where </p><p>they are forced into prostitution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During the year, there was at least one documented case of </p><p>trafficking in children reported in Lagos; however, incidents </p><p>of trafficking in Lagos and other major Nigerian cities are </p><p>suspected to be commonplace. Child traffickers receive a </p><p>monthly payment from the employer, part of which is to be </p><p>remitted to the parents of the indentured child servant. </p><p>Traffickers take advantage of a cultural tradition of </p><p>"fostering," under which it is acceptable to send a child to </p><p>live and work with a more prosperous family in an urban </p><p>center in return for educational and vocational advancement. </p><p>Often the children in these situations only work and do not </p><p>get any formal education; however, families who employ </p><p>children as domestic servants also pay their school fees. </p><p>They are forced to serve as domestics or to become street </p><p>hawkers selling nuts, fruits, or other items.  There were </p><p>credible reports that poor families sell their daughters into </p><p>marriage as a means of supplementing their income (see </p><p>Section 5). </p><p>According to ILO reports, there is an active and extensive </p><p>trade in child laborers, some of whom are trafficked to </p><p>Cameroon, Gabon, Benin, and Equatorial Guinea to work in </p><p>agricultural enterprises.  Other children are coerced into </p><p>prostitution (see Section 5).  Authorities also have </p><p>identified a trade route for traffickers of children for </p><p>labor through Katsina and Sokoto to the Middle East and East </p><p>Africa.  The eastern part of Nigeria and some southern states </p><p>such as Cross Rivers and Akwa Ibom have been the sites of </p><p>trafficking of children for labor and, in some cases, human </p><p>sacrifice.  The country remains a destination for the </p><p>trafficking of Togolese children. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>According to the Women Trafficking and Child Labor </p><p>Eradication Foundation, an average of 60 Nigerian girls and </p><p>women are repatriated every month. According to Titi </p><p>Abubakar, the founder of WOTCLEF, many trafficking victims </p><p>were involved in commercial sex, begging, menial jobs, or </p><p>forced marriages </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government has conducted few investigations into the </p><p>alleged involvement of government officials in trafficking; </p><p>however, allegations of such involvement is widespread. Some </p><p>returnees have alleged that immigration officials actively </p><p>connive with syndicates; however, there were no arrests of </p><p>immigration officials for trafficking offenses during the </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Draft legislation was under review in the National Assembly </p><p>that would make trafficking a crime; however, no action was </p><p>taken on it by year\'s end. There is government and societal </p><p>acknowledgement that trafficking in women is a continuing </p><p>problem, particularly to Europe.  Police attempts to stem the </p><p>trafficking of persons are inadequate and frequently focus on </p><p>the victims of trafficking, who often are subjected to </p><p>lengthy detention and public humiliation upon repatriation. </p><p>Traffickers were identified and punished in only a few cases. </p><p> Awareness campaigns, often conducted by spouses of prominent </p><p>politicians or NGO\'s, only recently have begun to garner </p><p>widespread attention.  There are few statistics available to </p><p>determine the success of antitrafficking campaigns.  The </p><p>development of a reliable statistical base for assessing the </p><p>child trafficking problem began under ILO auspices.  The </p><p>Nigerian national program of the ILO-IPEC\'s regional </p><p>trafficking program began in earnest in November 2001, after </p><p>the ILO-IPEC completed an assessment of trafficking in </p><p>Nigeria.  The regional and Nigeria programs are funded </p><p>completely by the U.S. Department of Labor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In one of the few cases of prosecution for trafficking, Bisi </p><p>Dan Musa, a prominent Lagos businesswoman and wife of a </p><p>former presidential candidate, was arrested and charged with </p><p>19 counts of "child stealing" and "slave dealing;" 16 </p><p>children between the ages of 1 and 4 reportedly were found in </p><p>her custody.  Her trial is ongoing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In August 33 Nigerian women and children were repatriated </p><p>from Conakry, Guinea, following the personal intervention of </p><p>President Obasanjo.  According to U.N. officials, trafficking </p><p>agents offered the women between $184 and $1,802 (20,000 to </p><p>200,000 naira) and promised good jobs.  Guinean authorities </p><p>reportedly arrested 15 Nigerian trafficking suspects in the </p><p>case, including a former police commissioner of Edo State; at </p><p>year\'s end, the they were extradited to Nigeria in October </p><p>and at year\'s end were being tried by the Federal High Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On August 12, a Nigerian man was detained in Sokoto state for </p><p>the alleged trafficking of 10 girls between the ages of 10 </p><p>and 16.  One of the girls reportedly said the man was taking </p><p>them to work abroad in hairdressing salons. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
