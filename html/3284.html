<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001344 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, ECON, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S FY 03 BUDGET FOCUSES ON SECURITY, CUTS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE </p><p> </p><p> ------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  On July 8 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba </p><p>presented a budget that for the first time puts "maintaining </p><p>peace and security" in the face of the Maoist insurgency </p><p>ahead of poverty alleviation as an "overriding priority." </p><p>Introduced by royal ordinance in the absence of Parliament, </p><p>the FY 03 budget increases security-related expenditures by </p><p>43 percent while cutting development expenditures by 23 </p><p>percent.  The lean budget, which features the narrowest </p><p>margin of increased expenditures ever, comes in the context </p><p>of a dismal .8 percent growth in GDP.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>BUDGET BY ORDINANCE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On July 8 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba presented </p><p>the USD 1.2 billion FY 03 budget to an assembly that included </p><p>dignitaries from the Government of Nepal (GON), </p><p>representatives from  the undissolved Upper House of </p><p>Parliament, and members of the diplomatic community at the </p><p>National Planning Commission.  The PM prefaced his speech by </p><p>justifying both his decision to extend the state of emergency </p><p>and his move to dissolve the Lower House of Parliament.  In </p><p>the absence of Parliament, the budget had been approved by </p><p>royal ordinance earlier the same day.  Nepal\'s fiscal year </p><p>begins July 17. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The budget, presented in the shadow of the </p><p>six-year-old Maoist insurgency, an extended state of </p><p>emergency, a dissolved Lower House of Parliament, and </p><p>impending national elections, was remarkable for several </p><p>"firsts."  Projected expenditures, for example, for the first </p><p>time declined (albeit by a modest 3 percent) in comparison to </p><p>the previous fiscal year.  Another first:  "maintaining peace </p><p>and security" displaced poverty alleviation as an "overriding </p><p>priority" for the first time.  Thus requested levels for </p><p>regular expenditures (about USD 736.4 million), boosted by a </p><p>43 percent surge in defense spending, outstripped requests </p><p>for development expenditures (about USD 495.8 million).  An </p><p>effort to aim at more realistic revenue estimates, based </p><p>primarily on improved tax and customs collection and </p><p>increases in import duties for certain goods, resulted in </p><p>projections 9 percent lower than the previous year.  Revenues </p><p>are expected to account for about 58 percent of expenditures, </p><p>with foreign grants and loans making up an additional 15 </p><p>percent and internal and external borrowing another 12.5 </p><p>percent.   A budget deficit that is 5.2 percent of GDP is </p><p>projected. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>WHAT MADE THE CUT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Since "development is not possible without peace," </p><p>funding for the Ministries of Home and Defense together </p><p>accounted for the single largest percent (23.6 percent) of </p><p>regular expenditures.  Regular expenditures in general will </p><p>be trimmed by an embargo on the procurement of new vehicles </p><p>(except for the security forces), contracting out of cleaning </p><p>and guard services for government offices, and the </p><p>elimination of redundant positions in the Public Service </p><p>Commission and in loss-making state-owned enterprises.  The </p><p>PM ranked poverty alleviation and employment promotion next </p><p>after this "investment for peace" required by the security </p><p>forces.  Electricity and road construction programs received </p><p>the most generous allotment of development expenditures at 18 </p><p>and 10 percent respectively, while education, irrigation, and </p><p>health services netted 8.5 percent, 7.7 percent, and 7.1 </p><p>percent respectively. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Some of the development projects that escaped </p><p>elimination under the uncharacteristically austere budget </p><p>included improved credit programs for agricultural borrowers; </p><p>subsidized training programs for former Maoists; </p><p>micro-hydropower schemes to provide electricity to another </p><p>5,000 households; the repair of infrastructure damaged by the </p><p>insurgents; expanded Food for Work programs for former bonded </p><p>laborers; and agricultural extension programs for apiculture, </p><p>sericulture, and livestock raising for remote rural areas. </p><p>The budget provided funding in the amount of approximately </p><p>USD 7 million for national elections, now scheduled for </p><p>November 13.  In an acknowledgement of widening unemployment </p><p>figures, the PM also announced the Government plans to send </p><p>100,000 young people abroad for foreign employment, with </p><p>priority given to "people from poor, downtrodden and ethnic </p><p>groups."  Foreign investment will be promoted by offering </p><p>ten-year, multiple-entry visas to non-resident Nepali </p><p>investors and by creating "a congenial atmosphere" for </p><p>investors of other nationalities.  Funding to begin </p><p>construction of an Export Processing Zone in the border city </p><p>of Bhairawa is also set aside. </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>GRIM GROWTH FIGURES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The budget presentation followed closely upon the </p><p>release of the annual Economic Survey, which reported a mere </p><p>.8 percent in GDP growth in FY 02, the smallest increase in </p><p>18 years.  (Note:  FY 01 GDP growth was 4.7 percent, while </p><p>6.14 percent growth was posted in FY 00.  End note.) </p><p>Agricultural productivity grew by only 1.7 percent, compared </p><p>with 4.3 percent the previous year.  Non-agricultural growth, </p><p>dragged down by the struggling tourism and garment </p><p>industries, meanwhile, grew by a minute .2 percent, compared </p><p>with 5 percent the previous year.  Per capita income declined </p><p>from USD 240 to USD 226 during FY 02. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The depressing performance of the current year </p><p>notwithstanding, the Government of Nepal (GON) is nonetheless </p><p>predicting an optimistic aggregate economic growth rate of </p><p>4.3 percent during the upcoming fiscal year.  Much of the </p><p>anticipated increase is predicated upon an inexplicably </p><p>projected 4.9 percent increase in the non-agricultural </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  So far the FY 03 budget has generated only muted </p><p>static from some quarters, including the Opposition Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML), both for its </p><p>slicing of the usual array of development programs and its </p><p>introduction despite the dissolution of Parliament.  While </p><p>its estimates for next year\'s growth seem somewhat rosier </p><p>than warranted--especially since we see no immediate relief </p><p>in sight for the depressed garment and tourism </p><p>industries--the GON appears to have made a legitimate effort </p><p>to meet donor demands to pare expenditures and develop more </p><p>modest projections for revenues.  In prior years the GON had </p><p>proved unable to spend all of the funds allocated for </p><p>development; the soaring costs of the insurgency have now </p><p>forced it to prioritize its spending.  The scuttling of many </p><p>GON-funded development projects is an unfortunate, but </p><p>inescapable, casualty of the insurgency. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
