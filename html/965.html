<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 008066 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, P, SA/PAB; LONDON FOR POL/SUTPHIN; PARIS FOR </p><p>POL/RAVELING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10/27/08 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PTER, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: PAKISTAN: FUNDAMENTALISM AND SUPPORT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN </p><p>AND THE TALIBAN IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE (C-NA8-01076) </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) STATE 190698, (B) ISLAMABAD 7155 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY JOHN R. SCHMIDT, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH A SAMPLING OF RURAL </p><p>PUNJABI POLITICIANS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT RECRUITMENT TO MILITANT </p><p>RELIGIOUS GROUPS IS INCREASING IN POORER AREAS OF THE PUNJABI </p><p>COUNTRYSIDE (PRIMARILY SOUTHERN PUNJAB), BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE </p><p>THAT A MASS FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>DEVELOPING.  THESE SAME SOURCES ALSO CONTEND THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN </p><p>AND THE TALIBAN ARE HIGHLY POPULAR AMONG POORLY EDUCATED PEOPLE </p><p>IN RURAL AREAS (AND PROBABLY URBAN AREAS AS WELL).  SUCH </p><p>POPULARITY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED, BUT </p><p>EXISTS AT THE LEVEL OF POPULAR CULTURE, REFLECTING THE NEED FOR </p><p>SUCCESSFUL ROLE MODELS ON THE PART OF ORDINARY MUSLIMS FED UP </p><p>WITH THE FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENTS TO MEET </p><p>BASIC HUMAN NEEDS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL A, POLCOUNS HAS RECENTLY SPOKEN </p><p>WITH THREE PML MNAS REPRESENTING RURAL CONSTITUENCIES IN THE </p><p>PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE.  THE THREE ARE MUMTAZ AHMED TARAR, A NAWAZ </p><p>SHARIF LOYALIST WHO SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC </p><p>SERVICES COMMITTEE, COL (R) GHULAM SARWAR CHEEMA, A PARTY </p><p>SWITCHING FORMER PPP MINISTER OF STATE WHO NOW SERVES AS CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF THE ASSEMBLY DEFENSE COMMITTEE, AND SARDAR MANSOOR HAYAT KHAN </p><p>TAMMAN, A LIBERAL-MINDED MNA NOW SERVING AS CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>FINANCE COMMITTEE, TO WHOM POLCOUNS PAID A REPEAT VISIT.  THE </p><p>SUBJECT WAS SUPPORT FOR ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM AND THE TALIBAN IN </p><p>THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN THE JUDGMENT OF POLCOUNS, TARAR WAS THE MOST </p><p>COMPELLING WITNESS.  IN A WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION, HE CONTENDED </p><p>THAT ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM (DEFINED AS SUPPORT FOR MILITANT </p><p>RELIGIOUS GROUPS) IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM ONLY IN RURAL </p><p>DISTRICTS CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE LANDHOLDINGS (I.E., QUASI-FEUDAL </p><p>AREAS), WHERE THERE WAS A STARK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVES AND HAVE </p><p>NOTS.  THE ECONOMIC DISPARITY IN THESE REGIONS HELPED TO FUEL </p><p>EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES.  HE CITED THE MULTAN, BAHAWALPUR, </p><p>MIANWALI AND SARGHODA AREAS AS EXAMPLES.  IN OTHER DISTRICTS, </p><p>WHERE SMALL LANDHOLDERS PREVAIL AND THERE IS A FUNCTIONING MIDDLE </p><p>CLASS, THERE ARE FEWER SOCIAL TENSIONS AND EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS </p><p>ATTITUDES ARE HELD BY ONLY BY A FEW.  HIS OWN DISTRICT, MANDI </p><p>BAHAUDIN IN CENTRAL PUNJAB, FELL INTO THE LATTER CATEGORY.  LESS </p><p>THAN ONE PERCENT OF HIS CONSTITUENTS BELONGED TO MILITANT GROUPS, </p><p>USUALLY THE SUNNI SECTARIAN SIPAH-E-SAHABA PAKISTAN (SSP). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) TARAR SAID THE CASE WAS QUITE DIFFERENT WITH RESPECT TO </p><p>SUPPORT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN.  HE BELIEVED THAT </p><p>UPWARDS OF NINETY PERCENT OF THE CONSTITUENTS IN HIS DISTRICT </p><p>AND, INDEED, THROUGHOUT URBAN AND RURAL PUNJAB, HAVE A HIGHLY </p><p>FAVORABLE OPINION OF BOTH BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN.  HE OPINED </p><p>THAT BIN LADEN IS THE HERO OF THE MOMENT IN PAKISTAN AND WOULD </p><p>WIN ANY ELECTION IN A LANDSLIDE.  THIS WAS NOT DUE TO ANY </p><p>WELLSPRING OF FUNDAMENTALIST RELIGIOUS SUPPORT.  HIS OWN </p><p>CONSTITUENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE NOT PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS.  IT </p><p>WAS DUE RATHER TO THE FACT THAT BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN </p><p>APPEARED TO ORDINARY FOLK AS ISLAMIC HEROES WHO HAD NOT ONLY </p><p>STOOD UP TO THE ANTI-ISLAMIC WEST BUT WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SO </p><p>DOING.  THIS WAS A HEADY CONTRAST TO THE PERCEIVED INEFFECTUALITY </p><p>OF THEIR OWN LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) TARAR ADDED THAT SUPPORT FOR THE 15TH AMENDMENT WAS </p><p>SIMILARLY WIDESPREAD IN HIS DISTRICT.  THIS WAS NOT DUE TO </p><p>RELIGIOUS CONVICTION, BUT BECAUSE HIS CONSTITUENTS BELIEVED THAT </p><p>IT WOULD EMPOWER THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING SWIFT JUSTICE AND LAW </p><p>AND ORDER TO THE COUNTRY.  DESPITE THE POPULARITY OF BIN LADEN </p><p>AND THE TALIBAN IN RURAL AREAS, TARAR SAW LITTLE DANGER THAT </p><p>PEOPLE FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE COULD BE PERSUADED TO TAKE MILITANT </p><p>ACTION.  THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO DAY STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE </p><p>AND TOO REMOVED FROM THE CENTERS OF POWER.  HIS OWN CONSTITUENTS </p><p>WERE MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON OBTAINING GOVERNMENT LOANS WHICH COULD </p><p>BE USED TO PAY AGENTS TO SMUGGLE THEM INTO WESTERN COUNTRIES.  HE </p><p>ESTIMATED THAT FIVE TO TEN PERCENT OF HIS CONSTITUENTS WERE </p><p>WORKING OR HAD WORKED ABROAD.  THE REAL DANGER CAME FROM THE </p><p>URBAN AREAS, WHERE THERE WAS A MUCH LARGER CADRE OF </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST RABBLE ROUSERS WHO COULD POTENTIALLY MOBILIZE </p><p>LARGE NUMBERS OF DISAFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE URBANE, HIGHLY POLISHED COL CHEEMA REPRESENTS A RURAL </p><p>PUNJABI CONSTITUENCY NEAR GUJRANWALA AND OWNS PROPERTY IN THREE </p><p>OTHERS (NEAR LAHORE, FAISALABAD AND JHANG).  HE WAS MUCH MORE </p><p>IMPRESSIONISTIC AND LESS SPECIFIC IN HIS OWN VIEWS ABOUT </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM IN RURAL PUNJAB.  HIS OWN BELIEF WAS THAT THE </p><p>FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE THE LOT OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE HAD DESTROYED THE FAITH OF ORDINARY PAKISTANIS IN THE </p><p>ABILITY OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL CLASS (MILITARY AND </p><p>CIVILIAN) TO PROVIDE GOOD GOVERNMENT AND SATISFY BASIC ECONOMIC </p><p>AND SOCIAL NEEDS.  THIS, IN TURN, HAD MADE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE </p><p>TO ALTERNATIVE MESSAGES, SUCH AS THOSE CONVEYED TWO DECADES AGO </p><p>BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND, MORE RECENTLY, BY THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) RICH WITH ANECDOTES, HE TOLD THE STORY OF AN ELDERLY </p><p>WOMAN WHO HAD COME TO HIM FOR HELP DURING A RECENT VISIT TO HIS </p><p>DISTRICT.  ALTHOUGH THE ONLY ELECTRICAL ITEM IN HER ONE ROOM </p><p>HOUSE WAS A LIGHT BULB HER BILL AMOUNTED TO 3000 RUPEES (60 </p><p>DOLLARS, A FORMIDABLE SUM).  ALTHOUGH SHE HAD A FAN, SHE COULD </p><p>NOT AFFORD TO RUN IT.  CHEEMA SAID THAT, WHILE HE HAD MANAGED TO </p><p>GET HER BILL REDUCED TO 2500 RUPEES, THE WOMAN WAS TYPICAL OF THE </p><p>CASES HE GETS DURING HIS WEEKLY AUDIENCES WITH CONSTITUENTS.  HIS </p><p>CONSTITUENTS WERE BENDING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF INCREASING POVERTY, </p><p>WHICH MADE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RADICAL RELIGIOUS MESSAGES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) CHEEMA ALSO BEMOANED THE MANY FUNDAMENTALIST MADRASSAS </p><p>(RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS) THAT HAD SPRUNG UP RECENTLY.  HE TOLD THE </p><p>STORY OF THE SON OF A CONSTITUENT WHO HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO DROP </p><p>OUT OF STANFORD BY A VISITING PAKISTANI "TABLIGHI" (LAY ISLAMIC </p><p>PROSELYTIZER) AND RETURN TO PAKISTAN TO ENROLL IN A MADRASSA NEAR </p><p>LAHORE.  HE HAD SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN LOST TO HIS FAMILY, WHO </p><p>STRUGGLED TO GAIN PERMISSION TO SEE HIM AND RECEIVED FOR THEIR </p><p>TROUBLES A PERFUNCTORY HELLO AND GOOD-BYE.  HIS SENSE WAS THAT </p><p>RECRUITMENT TO RADICAL MADRASSAS HAD BEEN SHARPLY ON THE INCREASE </p><p>RECENTLY, SERVING AS A MAGNET FOR DISAFFECTED YOUTH.  MUHAMMAD </p><p>KHALID MASUD, PROFESSOR OF ISLAMIC LAW AT THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY, ECHOED THIS IN A CONVERSATION WITH POLCOUNS </p><p>ON OCTOBER 24 CONTENDING THAT EXTREMIST VIEWS WERE COMING TO </p><p>DOMINATE THE ENTIRE MADRASSA SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) CHEEMA SAID IT WAS HIS SENSE THAT SUCH TRENDS WERE </p><p>FRAYING AT THE VERY FABRIC OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY, CAUSING THE </p><p>COUNTRY TO BEGIN COMING APART AT THE SEAMS.  SWITCHING METAPHORS, </p><p>HE LIKENED PAKISTAN TO A DRIED OUT BALE OF HAY THAT NEEDED ONLY </p><p>THE SLIGHTEST OF SPARKS TO SET IT ALIGHT.  NOTING THE SHARP </p><p>INCREASE IN SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND APPEARANCE OF MYRIAD SECTS ALL </p><p>HOLDING THEIR OWN MONOPOLIES ON THE TRUTH, HE FEARED THAT ONCE </p><p>THE SPARK WAS LIT ALL THESE GROUPS WOULD BE AT EACH OTHERS </p><p>THROATS.  LOOKING AT POLCOUNS RUEFULLY, HE COMMENTED THAT WHILE </p><p>POLCOUNS WOULD SERVE IN PAKISTAN FOR ONLY A YEAR OR TWO, HE AND </p><p>HIS COUNTRYMEN WERE CONDEMNED TO REMAIN BEHIND. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH TARAR AND CHEEMA, POLCOUNS </p><p>ALSO PAID A RETURN VISIT TO SARDAR MANSOOR HAYAT KHAN TAMMAN, WHO </p><p>HAD EARLIER REPORTED A SHARP INCREASE IN FUNDAMENTALISM AND PRO- </p><p>TALIBAN SENTIMENT IN HIS RURAL PUNJABI DISTRICT (REFTEL B). </p><p>TAMMAN DID NO BACKING AWAY FROM HIS EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM TAKING HOLD IN HIS DISTRICT.  HE SAID THE POVERTY </p><p>IN HIS DISTRICT HAD HELPED ATTRACT CONVERTS TO RADICAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>GROUPS.  AKRAM AWAN, A MIDDLE CLASS LANDLORD AND FOUNDER OF THE </p><p>RADICAL AKHAN UL MUSLIMIN PARTY, ALSO HAILS FROM HIS DISTRICT. </p><p>LIKE TARAR HE ALSO OBSERVED THAT, SINCE THE U.S. CRUISE MISSILE </p><p>STRIKES IN AFGHANISTAN, THE FORMERLY UNKNOWN OSAMA BIN LADEN HAD </p><p>BECOME A CELEBRITY AND SOMETHING OF A FOLK HERO AMONG THE </p><p>ORDINARY PEOPLE IN HIS DISTRICT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) SOME OF THE ABOVE OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN ALSO BEEN NOTED </p><p>BY CONSULATE LAHORE.  PO WAS STRUCK BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF FLAGS, </p><p>BANNERS AND SLOGANS FOR THE JIHADIST LASHKAR-E-TAIBA (LT) HE </p><p>NOTED IN SAHIWAL DISTRICT DURING A RECENT VISIT TO HARAPPA.  THIS </p><p>GROUP SPECIALIZES IN RECRUITING YOUNG PUNJABIS TO FIGHT IN </p><p>KASHMIR.  CONSULATE CONTACTS HAVE ALSO NOTED A CONTINUING </p><p>STRENGTHENING IN SUPPORT FOR THE SSP IN RURAL PARTS OF KHANEWAL, </p><p>TOBA TEK SINGH AND MULTAN DISTRICTS.  THE SSP ALSO RECENTLY </p><p>CAPTURED CONTROL OF THE JHANG MUNICIPALITY (ITS URBAN BIRTHPLACE) </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE RURAL JHANG HINTERLAND REMAINS FIRMLY UNDER THE </p><p>CONTROL OF THE LOCAL SHIA LANDLORD.  ACCORDING TO CONSULATE </p><p>LAHORE, MILITANT GROUPS SUCH AS THE SSP AND THE LT APPEAR TO BE </p><p>EXPANDING THEIR SUPPORT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS PARTIES, SUCH AS JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI AND JAMAAT-ULEMA-I- </p><p>ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) COMMENT: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD A CLEAR PICTURE </p><p>OF POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE </p><p>BASED ON A SMALL HANDFUL OF CONVERSATIONS.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THERE IS ANYTHING LIKE A MASS FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT </p><p>DEVELOPING IN THE RURAL AREAS.  OUR SENSE, RATHER, IS THAT THE </p><p>CONTINUING DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IS FUELING A </p><p>STEADY INCREASE IN THE RECRUITMENT OF DISAFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE </p><p>INTO RADICAL RELIGIOUS GROUPS LIKE THE SSP IN AREAS OF RURAL </p><p>PUNJAB (PRIMARILY THE SOUTH) WHERE POVERTY BITES THE HARDEST.  IN </p><p>RAISING A RED FLAG, TAMMAN IS PROBABLY REACTING MORE TO AN </p><p>IMPROVEMENT IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITY OF A LOCAL MILITANT </p><p>GROUP WITH PRO-TALIBAN SYMPATHIES THAN TO A LARGESCALE INCREASE </p><p>IN NUMBERS.  FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, THE DANGER IS NOT THAT RURAL </p><p>PUNJAB IS TURNING FUNDAMENTALIST, BUT THAT RADICAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>GROUPS ARE MAKING INROADS HERE JUST AS IN URBAN AREAS, FRAYING </p><p>GRADUALLY BUT INEXORABLY AT THE STABILITY OF THE STATE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  COMMENT CONT.  AS FOR THE ALLEGED WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR </p><p>OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN AMONG ORDINARY PEOPLE, OUR </p><p>INSTINCTS TELL US THIS MAY WELL BE CORRECT, BUT FOR THE REASONS </p><p>CITED BY TARAR.  SUCH ATTITUDES DO NOT REFLECT RADICAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>SENTIMENT OR EVEN ACTIVIST POLITICAL SUPPORT BUT OPERATE AT THE </p><p>LEVEL OF POPULAR CULTURE, WITH BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN VIEWED </p><p>AS A SUCCESSFUL ISLAMIC ROLE MODELS.  (PUNJABIS, AFTER ALL, ARE </p><p>MUCH MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN KASHMIR THAN IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.) </p><p> </p><p>14.  COMMENT CONT.  NONETHELESS, THE FACT THAT BIN LADEN AND THE </p><p>TALIBAN CAN FUNCTION AS CULTURAL ICONS IS CLEARLY AN INDICTMENT </p><p>OF THE PAKISTANI POLITICAL CLASS, WHICH HAS MISERABLY FAILED TO </p><p>PROVIDE EITHER GOOD GOVERNMENT OR POSITIVE ROLE MODELS.  IT IS </p><p>ALSO AN INDICATION OF THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF ORDINARY PAKISTANIS </p><p>TO ANTI-WESTERN PROPAGANDA, ITSELF NOURISHED BY THE FAILURE OF </p><p>SUCCESSIVE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENTS TO DELIVER THE GOODS, BUT </p><p>REFLECTING ALSO THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF YEARS OF WHAT HAS BEEN </p><p>PERCEIVED HERE AS ANTI-ISLAMIC BEHAVIOR BY THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MILAM </p><p></p></div>
