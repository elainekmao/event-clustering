(C)  In October 23 meetings with Deputy Assistant </p><p>Secretary for South Asian Affairs Donald Camp and the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Ambassador, newly appointed Foreign Minister Narendra Bikram </p><p>Shah and Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya both stressed </p><p>that the change in government will not affect Nepal\'s </p><p>inclination to conclude an Article 98 agreement with the U.S. </p><p> DAS Camp emphasized the USG\'s continued support for Nepal. </p><p>ForMin Shah assessed that the interim government can depend </p><p>on no more than "a few months of good will" from a public </p><p>anxious to see progress on resolving the insurgency and </p><p>holding elections.  Biographic information on the new Foreign </p><p>Minister follows in Paras 10-11 below.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>US SUPPORT:  "GREAT POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE" </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Deputy Assistant Secretary for South Asian Affairs </p><p>Donald Camp, accompanied by the Ambassador, DCM, and poloff </p><p>met October 23 with Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya and </p><p>Joint Secretary for South Asia Gyan Chandra Acharya.  DAS </p><p>Camp opened the meeting by expressing the USG\'s continued </p><p>support for the Government of Nepal (GON), reflected in </p><p>increased development and security assistance.  The Foreign </p><p>Secretary responded that the GON attaches "great political </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>significance" to USG support. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>ARTICLE 98 </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The October 11 change in government does not change </p><p>the GON\'s willingness to pursue an Article 98 agreement with </p><p>the U.S. (Ref A).  The MFA is "expediting" review of the </p><p>draft agreement with the Ministry of Law, the Foreign </p><p>Secretary said.  GON and USG views on the International </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Criminal Court coincide, he noted.  (Note:  The Foreign </p><p>Minister echoed this position in his subsequent meeting with </p><p>DAS Camp and the Ambassador, but asked for a list of </p><p>countries that have already concluded and/or are seriously </p><p>considering an Article 98 agreement. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>SUPPORT FROM INDIA, OTHERS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  The Ambassador asked for an assessment of Indian </p><p>cooperation in countering the Maoist insurgency.  The Foreign </p><p>Secretary responded that although the previous government of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Prime Minister Deuba had "a good understanding" with the </p><p>Indian government, India\'s "actions don\'t always match the </p><p>expectations here." While India had cooperated in banning the </p><p>All Indian-Nepali Unity Society, a Maoist front (Ref B), the </p><p>same organization has resurfaced in India under a different </p><p>name, the Foreign Secretary asserted.  India has given some </p><p>indication that it will increase military support; Acharya </p><p>cited rifles as one example.  The Chinese are helping "on a </p><p>token basis," while Russian offers are purely on a commercial </p><p>basis.  The GON has tried to allay Indian suspicions </p><p>surrounding US security assistance, the Foreign Secretary </p><p>added, by stressing the transparency of USG aid and aims. </p><p>The GON wants the support of India "in ways that are </p><p>acceptable and comfortable for us," Joint Secretary Acharya </p><p>interjected.  GON efforts at transparency are not the same as </p><p>seeking approval from India for accepting foreign aid, he </p><p>stressed. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>BHUTANESE REFUGEES </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The Foreign Secretary confirmed that Foreign </p><p>Minister Shah met briefly October 22 with the Bhutanese </p><p>Foreign Minister during the latter\'s stopover at the </p><p>Kathmandu airport.  Shah formally invited his Bhutanese </p><p>counterpart for the next (and long-pending) round of </p><p>bilateral talks aimed at resolving the Bhutanese refugee </p><p>problem; no date was fixed.  Joint Secretary Acharya said the </p><p>refugees are growing frustrated by the lack of progress; the </p><p>GON is worried the Maoists could exploit that frustration. </p><p>Disagreement persists between the two governments over what </p><p>action is to be taken with various categories of refugees </p><p>and, more specifically, over the definition of "forced" </p><p>eviction.  The Joint Secretary said he suspects the </p><p>Government of Bhutan is procrastinating because of dismay at </p><p>the number of bonafide refugees, based on the results of the </p><p>first (and so far only) joint verification exercise, it may </p><p>be required to take back.  He believes that the Bhutanese </p><p>government sometimes responds to international pressure.  The </p><p>GON has thus asked some European governments for help in </p><p>persuading the Bhutanese of the need for flexibility. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  DAS Camp noted that representatives of the USG, </p><p>including the Ambassador in New Delhi, has raised the issue </p><p>with the Bhutanese on a number of occasions.  Our main </p><p>leverage with the Bhutanese is moral suasion, he observed. </p><p>Since the Bhutanese are increasing the number of countries </p><p>with which they have Ambassadorial relations, the scope for </p><p>increasing international pressure may increase as well.  The </p><p>USG will continue to press for a timely resolution to the </p><p>refugee problem, both on its own and in concert with other </p><p>countries.  Joint Secretary Acharya suggested the USG might </p><p>persuade the Bhutanese to initiate dialogue with refugee </p><p>leaders in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER: "ONLY A FEW MONTHS OF GOOD WILL" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Immediately following the meeting with the Foreign </p><p>Secretary, DAS Camp, accompanied by the Ambassador and DCM, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>called on Foreign Minister Narendra Bikram Shah.  DAS Camp </p><p>noted the unprecedented level of bilateral cooperation, which </p><p>reflects USG support for Nepal.  DAS Camp and the Ambassador </p><p>welcomed the new government\'s commitment to holding elections </p><p>as soon as possible, as well as its continued interest in </p><p>concluding an Article 98 agreement. Shah thanked the USG for </p><p>its support.  He noted that he will make his first foreign </p><p>trip as Minister October 28 when he accompanies Crown Prince </p><p>Paras to the Global Mountain Summit in Bishkek. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Shah asked his visitors for the USG\'s assessment of </p><p>the constitutionality of the King\'s October 11 appointment of </p><p>the interim government.  The Ambassador acknowledged there is </p><p>some dispute among the political parties on this question, </p><p>but noted the current domestic political situation is </p><p>"breaking new ground."  No previous King had ever used the </p><p>authority apparently granted him under Clause 127 of the </p><p>Constitution; the Clause itself has never been subjected to </p><p>judicial review.  The important thing is that all Nepalis, </p><p>regardless of political affiliation, present a united front </p><p>against the Maoists.  The King is trying, so far with limited </p><p>success, to make this happen. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Once former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was </p><p>expelled from the Nepali Congress and registered his own </p><p>party with the Election Commission, he was no longer the </p><p>leader of the largest party in Parliament and thus lost the </p><p>moral right to be Prime Minister, Shah said.  Had King </p><p>Gyanendra had agreed to Deuba\'s request for a year-long </p><p>extension in office, such an act would have been "a massive </p><p>violation" of the Constitution.  Shah believes the King acted </p><p>to save the Constitution.  He had to dismiss Deuba before </p><p>October 6--the deadline set by the Election Commission to </p><p>file nominations for general elections--and before </p><p>campaigning began in earnest.  The basic tasks of the </p><p>caretaker government are to hold elections--within six months </p><p>at the latest--and to restore security.  While acknowledging </p><p>that so far there has been no popular outcry against the </p><p>King\'s action, he believes the caretaker government can </p><p>expect "only a few months of good will" before the public </p><p>grows impatient for results. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON NARENDRA BIKRAM SHAH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Narendra Bikram Shah, called out of retirement by </p><p>his October 11 appointment as Foreign Minister by King </p><p>Gyanendra, had a lengthy and distinguished career in Nepal\'s </p><p>Foreign Service, serving as Ambassador in both the Panchayat </p><p>era and after the restoration of democracy in 1990.  Shah </p><p>held the post of Nepal\'s Permanent Representative to the UN </p><p>from 1995-1999; Foreign Secretary from 1986 to 1992; and as </p><p>Ambassador to the USSR from 1981 to 1985.  A former </p><p>diplomatic colleague at the UN describes him as witty, </p><p>intelligent, and a long-time friend to the U.S. </p><p>11.  (U)  Shah was born January 1, 1940, in Dhadhing District </p><p>in central Nepal.  He graduated with a Masters degree in </p><p>history from Calcutta University in 1960.  He returned to </p><p>India as Counselor at Nepal\'s Embassy in New Delhi from </p><p>1972-1976. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) DAS Camp did not have the opportunity to clear this </p><p>message before departing from Kathmandu. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
