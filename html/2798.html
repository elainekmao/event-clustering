<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000955 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND SCHLACHTER, </p><p>AF/RA FOR SWANN, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ZIM TURNS 22; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Editorials published in the April 18 and 19 editions </p><p>   of </p><p>   the mainstream newspapers concentrate on Zimbabwe\'s 22nd </p><p>   anniversary.  Editorial excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   Under headline "Spirit of togetherness is heartening," </p><p>   the government-controlled daily "The Herald" (04/19) </p><p>   comments: </p><p> </p><p>   "The turnout at yesterday\'s independence celebrations </p><p>   throughout the country is a clear affirmation of </p><p>   President Mugabe\'s leadership.  Thousands of Zimbabweans </p><p>   from both the ruling ZANU PF and opposition MDC turned </p><p>   out to hear President Mugabe\'s independence message. </p><p>   For the first time in over two years, the MDC joined </p><p>   hands with other Zimbabweans to commemorate the </p><p>   country\'s 22 years of independence. . .This show of </p><p>   unity was in keeping with President Mugabe\'s call for </p><p>   all Zimbabweans to cast their political, religious, </p><p>   ethnic or cultural differences aside and concentrate on </p><p>   nation building.  Zimbabweans have been waiting for a </p><p>   long time to see this kind of political maturity </p><p>   displayed as it sends the right signals to the outside </p><p>   world that, despite our political differences, we are </p><p>   one nation.  The celebration of this Independence Day by </p><p>   all nationals should signify a new thinking and unity of </p><p>   purpose.  It is an affirmation of the country\'s </p><p>   sovereignty and will send an unambiguous message to the </p><p>   country\'s detractors that were bent on dividing the </p><p>   nation and re-colonizing us.  We expect the entire </p><p>   country to rally behind its leaders in charting a new </p><p>   course for the revival of the economy. . .The </p><p>   independence celebrations have started the ball rolling </p><p>   and political leaders should now tone down inflammatory </p><p>   statements that don\'t build the nation but distract </p><p>   attention from the real development needs of the people. </p><p>   . .We also commend the leader of the MDC, Mr. Morgan </p><p>   Tsvangirai, for urging his supporters to attend the </p><p>   independence celebrations. . .This gesture is a good </p><p>   sign for the future and will mean that the opposition </p><p>   can now be part and parcel of the various national </p><p>   processes of the country. . .A new chapter was opened. . </p><p>   .and hopefully there will be no one to spoil this new </p><p>   spirit of togetherness as we join hands to build a new, </p><p>   revitalized Zimbabwe." </p><p> </p><p>3.   Under headline "Journey without maps," the independent </p><p>   weekly "The Financial Gazette" (04/18) comments: </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .But for all the seemingly business-as-usual </p><p>   attitude adopted by Zimbabwe\'s leaders in the face of </p><p>   widening international condemnation and isolation, it is </p><p>   clear that the sanctions are beginning to have a telling </p><p>   and that Mugabe and his officials are deeply worried </p><p>   about the road ahead.  Nothing bears out the </p><p>   government\'s worry more than its rabid response to the </p><p>   sanctions because, if they were of no effect at all, </p><p>   none of its members would bother even to respond.  And </p><p>   yet despite this realization, Harare somehow seems to </p><p>   think that it has the wherewithal to ride over the storm </p><p>   of its isolation, in the same manner as former Rhodesian </p><p>   premier Ian Smith hoped he would do in the turbulent </p><p>   1960s and 1970s.  As Smith now knows only too well, a </p><p>   vain attempt to defy the world over a clear injustice </p><p>   has its price, and Rhodesia and Smith himself eventually </p><p>   learnt this lesson to their grief.  It won\'t be </p><p>   different now for Mugabe. . .As Zimbabwe today marks its </p><p>   22 years of independence, is it not an irony that the </p><p>   country is once again under international sanctions for </p><p>   government-sponsored anarchy, as it was for several </p><p>   years up to 1980?  Instead of withdrawing into a cul-de- </p><p>   sac and hoping that normalcy will eventually return to </p><p>   Zimbabwe, Mugabe and his advisers must get real and do </p><p>   so quickly.  They need to acknowledge the deep-seated </p><p>   grievances that their actions have caused and correct </p><p>   these before it is too late.  Not even the half-backed </p><p>   economic reforms led by agriculture, which the </p><p>   government is toying around with, will ever work in a </p><p>   climate of mayhem and international sanctions.  The </p><p>   alternative to doing the right thing now is clear: </p><p>   Mugabe and his government will face the same ignominious </p><p>   exit as Smith did.  It could even be worse." </p><p> </p><p>4.   Under headline "Marking final victory over the </p><p>   colonial </p><p>   yoke," the government-controlled daily "The Herald" </p><p>   (04/18) ran the following comment on page one: </p><p> </p><p>   "Although battered and bruised, Zimbabweans today </p><p>   celebrate the final victory against the yoke of </p><p>   colonialism and can now stand proud and tall as a truly </p><p>   independent African nation. . .Despite 22 years of </p><p>   independence, the ghost of colonialism was still </p><p>   haunting the country and this spook was finally </p><p>   exorcised in the March 9-11 presidential poll.  The </p><p>   country has now truly come of age and will have to learn </p><p>   to stand on its own feet.  The sanctions that are being </p><p>   applied against Zimbabwe by mostly European countries </p><p>   and the U. S. remove the safety guards the country </p><p>   needed in its early years of independence.  While most </p><p>   urbanites are reasonably concerned and scared at the </p><p>   prospect of going it alone, we need to assure them that </p><p>   this is the perfect opportunity for the country to dig </p><p>   deep within itself and develop a truly Zimbabwean </p><p>   economy that is owned and driven by its own people.  The </p><p>   sanctions are indeed a blessing in disguise as they </p><p>   serve as a test among ourselves to see whether we </p><p>   qualify to be independent or not.  We have had 22 years </p><p>   to learn the ropes of governance and business, it is now </p><p>   time we started fending for ourselves. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>5.   Under headline "Little cause for cheer on Independence </p><p>   Day," the independent daily "The Daily News" (04/18) </p><p>   comments: </p><p> </p><p>   "Today, the government will reflect on its 22-year rule. </p><p>   It would like everyone to believe that its achievements </p><p>   are unparalleled, but that is not entirely true.  Its </p><p>   gains were during the first decade of independence and </p><p>   were in the areas of education and health.  However, </p><p>   since the 1990s, there was a rapid erosion of those </p><p>   gains that the losses now seem to outweigh the </p><p>   achievements. . .Lest the people are bamboozled, those </p><p>   attending the Independence celebrations today need to </p><p>   see beyond the rhetoric and identify who is to blame for </p><p>   the sorry state Zimbabwe finds itself in." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
