<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 001159 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, YE </p><p>SUBJECT: REORGANIZATION OF THE IRAQI MFA AND RECALL OF COM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 126507 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ALAN MISENHEIMER FOR REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> ------ </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  The Foreign Minister\'s Office Director </p><p>confirms that Iraq\'s former Ambassador left Sanaa before the </p><p>war, that the remaining diplomats are keeping a low profile, </p><p>and that the ROYG continues to protect the Embassy as </p><p>inviolable diplomatic premises. In these circumstances, he </p><p>believes it impractical to make promises about Iraqi </p><p>diplomatic files or consular seals. Also, two Yemeni </p><p>diplomats remained in Iraq throughout the war: they report no </p><p>major problems to date. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>No Iraqi Ambassador in Yemen </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>2. (u) On May 20, Pol/Econ chief discussed the reorganization </p><p>of the Iraqi MFA with Marwan Noman, Office Director for </p><p>Foreign Minister Qirbi. He promised to convey to the Minister </p><p>the non-paper containing reftel talking points immediately, </p><p>in preparation for his subsequent meeting with Ambassador </p><p>Hull. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Noman confirmed that Iraq\'s Ambassador to Yemen, Taha </p><p>Y. Al Basri, left Sanaa before the war began. The remaining </p><p>diplomats are keeping a low profile now, and the embassy </p><p>premises are guarded, as before, by ROYG soldiers.  He did </p><p>not know if they had been contacted by the Iraqi MFA steering </p><p>committee headed by Ambassador Ahmed. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>But What About the Babies? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>4. (C)  Noman agreed that it would be "most inappropriate" </p><p>for the remaining diplomats to exercise any diplomatic </p><p>authority.  However, as a lawyer who specializes in </p><p>diplomatic law, he personally questioned the need to suspend </p><p>consular functions, especially services to expatriate Iraqi </p><p>citizens.  "If an Iraqi baby is born, or an Iraqi marries a </p><p>Yemeni, their papers must be endorsed by their Embassy.  Who </p><p>else would do that?  The American Embassy as the occupying </p><p>power?"  He stressed again that his questions were personal </p><p>and hypothetical, but he hoped the impending United Nations </p><p>resolution on Iraq would clarify the responsibilities of the </p><p>occupying power. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) As for ensuring that the Iraqi staff do not remove </p><p>diplomatic files or consular seals, he speculated that they </p><p>had burned anything they wanted to well before the </p><p>Ambassador\'s departure.  Since the Embassy chancery and </p><p>grounds remained inviolable diplomatic premises, the MFA can </p><p>not prevent future bonfires, or take an inventory of </p><p>sensitive diplomatic and consular material. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>The Foreign Minister Concurs </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>6. (C)  FM Qirbi reiterated the same line in a 5/22 meeting </p><p>with Ambassador Hull (other subjects reported septel). He </p><p>noted that an initial concern had been to protect the two </p><p>remaining Iraqi diplomats from possible attack by Iraqi </p><p>expats resident in Yemen.  They remain under security </p><p>surveillance but no such attack has materialized.  Qirbi </p><p>added that several Iraqi academics he knows intend to remain </p><p>in Yemen for some time, but eventually want to return to </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Yemeni Diplomats in Baghdad </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>7. (U) Noman confirmed that two diplomats remain in Yemen\'s </p><p>Baghdad Embassy.  The embassy is undamaged, and the diplomats </p><p>have reported by radio to Sanaa that they are well. Noman was </p><p>not aware of any contacts with ORHA. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>8. (C) Comment:  The Yemen Government is probably relieved </p><p>that the Iraqi Ambassador did not stick around to become an </p><p>embarrassment. While Noman claims "diplomatic inviolability" </p><p>cloaks the remaining Iraqi diplomats in the embassy, we </p><p>expect the ROYG is keeping a very good eye on their </p><p>activities. End Comment </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
