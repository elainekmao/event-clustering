The full text of the ICS has also </p><p>been transmitted by e-mail to EUR/IFD/OIA for the </p><p>attention of </p><p>Neil Feird and Ann McConnell July 24, 2003.

Openness to Foreign Investment </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Netherlands\' trade and investment policy is </p><p>among the most open in the world.  With combined </p><p>merchandise exports and imports accounting for more </p><p>than two-thirds of GDP, the Dutch economy is one of the </p><p>most internationally oriented.  The Netherlands remains </p><p>among the world\'s largest suppliers of investment </p><p>capital and currently ranks number six among the </p><p>world\'s ten largest foreign investors (third if FDI is </p><p>related to GDP).  The Netherlands also ranks number six </p><p>among global recipients of FDI.  The Dutch government </p><p>maintains liberal policies toward foreign direct </p><p>investment, and adheres to the OECD investment codes. </p><p> </p><p>3. The only Dutch exception to the principle of </p><p>national treatment is in air transport.  Nationality </p><p>and ownership requirements apply for licenses to </p><p>operate an airline, and the right to cabotage is </p><p>reserved to national carriers.  With the exception of a </p><p>few public and private monopolies from which foreign </p><p>and domestic private investment is banned (the </p><p>Netherlands central bank, Netherlands railways, </p><p>national airport Amsterdam Schiphol, national carrier </p><p>KLM, and public broadcasting) foreign firms are able to </p><p>invest in any sector and are entitled under the law to </p><p>equal treatment with domestic firms. </p><p> </p><p>4. European Union reciprocity provisions in banking and </p><p>investment services and in a few other areas bind the </p><p>Dutch.  Provisions related to government incentives, </p><p>national rules of incorporation, and access to the </p><p>capital market are all administered on a </p><p>non-discriminatory basis.  Business laws and </p><p>regulations are in accordance with international legal </p><p>practices and standards and apply equally to foreign </p><p>and Dutch companies. </p><p> </p><p>5. Structural and regulatory reforms have long been an </p><p>integral part of a major reorientation of Dutch </p><p>economic policy.  Product market competition is </p><p>strengthened by way of programs aimed at strengthening </p><p>market forces, deregulation and legislative quality </p><p>combined with tightening of competition policy. The </p><p>government has reduced its role in the economy by </p><p>introducing market forces in formerly public utilities </p><p>sectors.  While the gas and electricity sectors are </p><p>gradually being opened up to foreign competition, </p><p>government-controlled entities retain dominant </p><p>positions in rail transport and water sector and </p><p>continue to play a large role in aviation and in </p><p>telecommunications. </p><p> </p><p>6. Despite relatively high Dutch labor costs and labor </p><p>market imperfections (complex labor laws resulting in </p><p>restrictive hiring and firing practices for employers), </p><p>foreign investors have found the Netherlands a </p><p>favorable location for their European investment </p><p>projects.  The Dutch actively solicit foreign </p><p>investment through the Netherlands Foreign Investment </p><p>Agency (NFIA), and related regional economic </p><p>development companies. Approximately 30 percent of </p><p>total FDI in the European Union is directed towards the </p><p>Netherlands.  Foreign direct investment is concentrated </p><p>in growth areas including information technology, </p><p>biotechnology, medical technology and food processing. </p><p>Investment projects are predominantly in contract </p><p>manufacturing (high-tech assembly), distribution, and </p><p>value-added logistics.  Ernst & Young\'s international </p><p>annual benchmark studies identify the Netherlands as </p><p>one of four most popular locations for foreign ICT in </p><p>Europe, while also ranking the Dutch biotechnology </p><p>sector among Europe\'s elite. </p><p> </p><p>7. The Netherlands also ranks among the countries in </p><p>Europe with the largest number of broadband connections </p><p>and the highest internet penetration in the European </p><p>Union.  According to the Economic Intelligence Unit </p><p>(EIU) e-commerce readiness survey, the Netherlands </p><p>ranks third in the world due to continued rollout of </p><p>broadband services, internet related legislation and </p><p>government programs.  The government will shortly </p><p>embark on a broadband action program aimed at creating </p><p>the regulatory framework that will stimulate and </p><p>facilitate broadband development. </p><p>8. The Netherlands is particularly attractive for the </p><p>establishment of European headquarters, European </p><p>distribution centers, call centers and shared services </p><p>centers.  Investment surveys indicate that U.S. </p><p>investors in particular favor the Netherlands as a </p><p>location for European Distribution Centers (EDCs).  An </p><p>estimated 60 percent of U.S. companies in Europe have </p><p>located their EDCS in the Netherlands.  Following the </p><p>introduction in 1997 of a more friendly tax regime, the </p><p>number of European headquarters established in the </p><p>Netherlands has also increased sharply to nearly ninety </p><p>in 2002.  A special Corporate Financing Arrangement </p><p>(CFA) allows European headquarters established in the </p><p>Netherlands to set aside eighty percent of intra- </p><p>company financing into a tax-free reserve, thereby </p><p>reducing the effective corporate tax rate to seven </p><p>percent from a normal rate of 34.5 percent. </p><p> </p><p>9. Foreign investors find the Netherlands attractive </p><p>because of the country\'s stable political and </p><p>macroeconomic climate, a highly developed financial </p><p>sector, the presence of a well educated, and productive </p><p>labor force, and the high quality of Dutch physical and </p><p>communications infrastructure. The Netherlands ranks </p><p>among the world\'s most internationally oriented </p><p>countries, second only to Singapore. </p><p> </p><p>10. Various international surveys rank the Netherlands </p><p>among the top ten countries in the industrialized world </p><p>with the most competitive economies and most favorable </p><p>business and investment climate.  The 2003 World </p><p>Competitive Survey by the Swiss-based Institute for </p><p>Management Development (IMD) ranked the Netherlands </p><p>eighth among the world\'s most competitive (smaller) </p><p>economies.  The Economist Intelligence Unit\'s (EIU) </p><p>2003 survey of the global business environment singled </p><p>out the Netherlands as the country with the most </p><p>favorable business climate for the period 2003-2007, </p><p>due to its political stability and effectiveness, </p><p>policy towards investment and the availability of </p><p>finance.  Finally, a recent OECD study cites the </p><p>Netherlands among countries offering the best </p><p>environment for direct investment. </p><p> </p><p>11. The Netherlands is also known for its favorable </p><p>fiscal climate. Precise tax guidance given to foreign </p><p>investors provides transparency with regard to long- </p><p>term tax obligations.  A recent Forbes global tax </p><p>burden survey ranked the Netherlands relatively </p><p>favorably with regard to the overall tax burden as well </p><p>as the marginal tax rate. </p><p> </p><p>12. Despite predominantly favorable business and </p><p>investment conditions, other international </p><p>organizations, including the World Economic Forum, flag </p><p>a sharp erosion of the competitive position as a major </p><p>challenge confronting the Netherlands.  More </p><p>specifically, relatively high wage cost, growing </p><p>imperfections in the road infrastructure, and a less </p><p>than flexible labor market are sited as potential </p><p>bottlenecks in attracting foreign direct investment to </p><p>the Netherlands. </p><p> </p><p>13. Deterioration of the fiscal climate due to sharper </p><p>tax competition among EU Member States and measures by </p><p>the European Commission aimed against national tax </p><p>incentives with a subsidy element is likely to also </p><p>affect the Dutch competitive environment.  To this end, </p><p>the CFA corporate financing arrangement will be </p><p>abolished in January of 2004 as a state subsidy harmful </p><p>to EU tax competition. </p><p> </p><p>14. There are no apparent foreign investment screening </p><p>mechanisms and 100 percent foreign ownership is </p><p>permitted in those sectors open to foreign investment. </p><p>The rules on acquisition, mergers, takeovers, and </p><p>reinvestment are nondiscriminatory.  All firms must </p><p>conform to certain rules of conduct on mergers and </p><p>takeovers.  The Social Economic Council (SER), an </p><p>official advisory body composed of representatives of </p><p>government, business and labor, administers Dutch </p><p>merger and takeover rules.  SER rules are intended, </p><p>first and foremost, to protect the interests of </p><p>stakeholders and employees.  They include requirements </p><p>for timely announcement of merger and takeover plans </p><p>and for discussions with trade unions.  A survey among </p><p>European companies by Heidrick & Struggles ranks the </p><p>Netherlands second after the United Kingdom for its </p><p>transparency of corporate governance practices. </p><p>Despite the supposedly open policy, elaborate corporate </p><p>protective measures against hostile takeovers may de </p><p>facto block acquisitions or takeovers by Dutch and </p><p>foreign investors.  A draft corporate governance code </p><p>of conduct that seeks to improve transparency in </p><p>shareholder/management relations as well as structure </p><p>and accountability of management, was introduced in </p><p>July 2003.  The code of conduct, providing for a </p><p>marginal reduction of takeover defenses, will become </p><p>effective as of January 1, 2004. </p><p> </p><p>15. The Netherlands maintains no preferential or </p><p>discriminatory export or import policies with the </p><p>exception of those that result from its membership in </p><p>the European Union.  The Dutch also abide by all </p><p>internationally agreed strategic trade controls,(e.g. </p><p>the Wassenaar Agreement). In summary, Dutch domestic </p><p>restrictions on foreign investment remain minimal and </p><p>no new ones are being planned.  The Dutch investment </p><p>climate should continue as it is, but will increasingly </p><p>be influenced by EU policies. </p><p> </p><p>A.2. Conversion and Transfer Policies </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>16. There are no restrictions on the conversion or </p><p>repatriation of capital and earnings (including branch </p><p>profits, dividends, interest, royalties), or management </p><p>and technical service fees, with the exception of the </p><p>nominal exchange license requirement for non-resident </p><p>firms. </p><p> </p><p>A.3.  Expropriation and Compensation </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>17. The Netherlands maintains strong protection on all </p><p>types of property, including private property, and the </p><p>right of citizens to own and use property. </p><p>Expropriation would only take place in the public </p><p>interest and with adequate compensation.  We have no </p><p>reason to believe that it would be undertaken in a </p><p>discriminatory manner or in violation of established </p><p>principles of international law.  The embassy is </p><p>unaware of any recent expropriation claims involving </p><p>the Dutch government and U.S. or other foreign-owned </p><p>property. </p><p> </p><p>A.4.  Dispute Settlement </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>18. The embassy is not aware of any investment dispute </p><p>involving the Dutch government and U.S. or other </p><p>foreign companies.  The Netherlands is a signatory to </p><p>the International Convention on Investment Disputes and </p><p>a member of the International Center for the Settlement </p><p>of Investment Disputes (ICSID).  Although the central </p><p>government has no rules regarding withdrawals of </p><p>investment, occasionally trade unions go to court over </p><p>company closures.  This has occurred in the case of </p><p>both domestic and foreign-owned firms. </p><p> </p><p>A.5 Performance Requirements/Incentives </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>19. There are no trade-related investment performance </p><p>requirements in the Netherlands.  General requirements </p><p>to qualify for investment subsidy schemes apply equally </p><p>to domestic and foreign investors.  There are no </p><p>requirements for employment of local capital or </p><p>managerial personnel.  However, in practice almost all </p><p>chief executives of major U.S. subsidiaries in the </p><p>Netherlands are Dutch or other EU nationals, because </p><p>skilled managers are available at a cost less than that </p><p>of posting an American abroad.  In the case of staff </p><p>personnel, however, Dutch nationals must be employed </p><p>unless firms can demonstrate that a Dutch national </p><p>cannot perform the job in question.  This burden is </p><p>eased by an existing provision that prior employment </p><p>with the firm of at least two and a half years amounts </p><p>to a presumption of unique qualifications for the job. </p><p> </p><p>20. Limited, targeted investment incentives have long </p><p>been a well-publicized tool of Dutch economic policy to </p><p>facilitate economic restructuring and to promote energy </p><p>conservation, regional development, environmental </p><p>protection, R&D, and other national socio-economic </p><p>goals.  Subsidies and incentives are available to </p><p>foreign and domestic firms alike and are spelled out in </p><p>detailed regulations.  Subsidies are in the form of tax </p><p>credits that are usually disbursed through corporate </p><p>tax rebates or direct cash payments in the event of no </p><p>tax liability. </p><p> </p><p>21. Reflecting the European Union\'s limits on direct </p><p>government support, the Regional Investment Projects </p><p>Subsidies Scheme (BSRI), formerly IPR, is the only </p><p>major investment incentive still available to </p><p>investors.  The BSRI aims to encourage corporate </p><p>investment in parts of the country with a high </p><p>unemployment rate by giving an investment grant for new </p><p>investments (industrial buildings and fixed assets) or </p><p>the acquisition of land.  Investment costs qualifying </p><p>for BSRI grants include costs incurred for the </p><p>acquisition of land, necessary buildings and durable </p><p>equipment.  BSRI cash grants of up to 20 percent of </p><p>actual investment costs are available up to a maximum </p><p>of approximately $13 million per project.  Sharply </p><p>rising unemployment, a major criterion for Brussels </p><p>approval of national investment subsidies, is likely to </p><p>increase the significance of the BSRI as an investment- </p><p>stimulating instrument. </p><p> </p><p>22. Local investment subsidies are sometimes also </p><p>available from regional development companies. </p><p>Regional non-tax incentives are available in the form </p><p>of cash grants, low-interest loans, local government </p><p>participation and export guarantees for selected areas. </p><p>The growing number of tax incentives offered to </p><p>investors in other EU countries has prompted the </p><p>government to look into the possibilities of expanding </p><p>existing tax instruments to aggressively improve the </p><p>Dutch tax climate vis--vis that in competitor </p><p>countries like Belgium, Germany and Ireland. Right to </p><p> </p><p>A.6. Right To Private Ownership and Establishment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>23. There are full rights of private ownership and </p><p>establishment of business enterprises in the </p><p>Netherlands, except in the monopoly sectors as noted in </p><p>the introduction.  Despite the fact that service </p><p>providers must often meet stringent licensing </p><p>requirements, numerous enterprises in the Netherlands </p><p>are 100 percent owned by foreign firms, including many </p><p>from the United States.  Licenses are granted on the </p><p>basis of competitive equality. </p><p> </p><p>A.7. Protection of Property Rights </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>24. The Netherlands has a generally good set of </p><p>legislation and regulations that protect intellectual </p><p>property rights.  However, the enforcement of </p><p>anti-piracy laws remains a concern to producers of </p><p>software and digital media (see below).  The </p><p>Netherlands belongs to the World Intellectual Property </p><p>Organization (WIPO), is a signatory of the Paris </p><p>Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, </p><p>and conforms to the accepted international practice for </p><p>protection of technology and trademarks. The Dutch have </p><p>been slow in implementing EU directives bringing </p><p>domestic legislation in line with the WIPO 1996 </p><p>Copyright Treaty (WCT), the WIPO performance and </p><p>phonogram treaty (WPPT), and the EU 98/44/ec directive. </p><p>There is an overall sense among policy makers to step </p><p>up measures aimed at raising awareness of Intellectual </p><p>Property Rights (IPR) rules and regulations and to </p><p>strengthen enforcement. </p><p> </p><p>25. Patents for foreign investors are granted </p><p>retroactively to the date of original filing in the </p><p>home country, provided the application is made through </p><p>a Dutch patent lawyer within one year of the original </p><p>filing date.  Patents are valid for 20 years.  Legal </p><p>procedures exist for compulsory licensing if the patent </p><p>is inadequately used after a period of three years, but </p><p>these procedures have rarely been invoked.  Since the </p><p>Netherlands and the United States are both parties to </p><p>the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) of 1970, patent </p><p>rights in the Netherlands may be obtained if PCT </p><p>application is used.  The Netherlands is a signatory of </p><p>the European Patent Convention, which provides for a </p><p>centralized Europe-wide patent protection system.  This </p><p>convention has simplified the process for obtaining </p><p>patent protection in the Member States.  Infringement </p><p>proceedings remain within the jurisdiction of the </p><p>national courts, which could result in divergent </p><p>interpretations detrimental to US investors and </p><p>exporters. </p><p> </p><p>26. The enforcement of anti-piracy laws remains a </p><p>concern to producers of software, audio and videotapes </p><p>and textbooks from the United States.  Organized </p><p>optical disc software piracy and e-commerce piracy are </p><p>also of major concern to the Dutch.  Annual losses to </p><p>the US motion picture industry due to audiovisual </p><p>piracy in the Netherlands have been estimated at tens </p><p>of millions of dollars annually.  The Dutch government </p><p>has recognized the need to protect intellectual </p><p>property rights and law enforcement personnel have </p><p>worked with industry associations to find and seize </p><p>pirated software.  Dutch IPR legislation currently in </p><p>place explicitly includes computer software as </p><p>intellectual property under the copyright statutes. </p><p> </p><p>A.8. Transparency of the Regulatory System </p><p> </p><p>27. Laws and regulations that affect direct investment, </p><p>such as environmental rules, health and safety </p><p>regulations, etc., are non-discriminatory and apply </p><p>equally to foreign and domestic firms.  Dutch tax law </p><p>facilitates attracting non-Dutch personnel to live and </p><p>work in the Netherlands. Currently, expatriate staff </p><p>transferred to the Netherlands on a temporary contract </p><p>can make use of the 30 percent ruling.  The ruling </p><p>provides that 30 percent of his/her gross employment </p><p>income in the Netherlands is not taxable under Dutch </p><p>personal income tax laws. This treatment is granted for </p><p>a maximum of ten years.  Furthermore, the expatriate is </p><p>considered a non-resident, meaning that only income </p><p>from Dutch sources is taxed in the Netherlands. </p><p> </p><p>28. Dutch corporations and branches of foreign </p><p>corporations currently are subject to a corporate tax </p><p>rate of 34.5 percent (profits of up to _ 22,689 </p><p>($24,000) are taxed at a rate of 29 percent) on taxable </p><p>profits, which puts the Netherlands at the higher end </p><p>of the corporate tax bracket in the European Union. </p><p>Dutch corporate taxation generally allows for the </p><p>exemption of dividends and capital gains derived from a </p><p>foreign subsidiary (participation exemption).  A survey </p><p>by Baker & McKenzie into the corporate tax structure of </p><p>EU Member States observed that both the corporate tax </p><p>rate and the effective corporate tax rate (20.67 </p><p>percent in the year 2001) are higher than the European </p><p>average.  Nevertheless, the Dutch corporate tax </p><p>structure ranks among the most competitive in Europe. </p><p>A further reduction of the corporate tax rate to 30 </p><p>percent to bring the effective corporate rate closer to </p><p>the EU average has therefore been proposed.  No local </p><p>Dutch income taxes are levied on corporations. </p><p>Furthermore, the Netherlands maintains an extensive </p><p>network of tax treaties with a large number of </p><p>countries.  A new tax treaty with the U.S. took effect </p><p>on January 1, 1994. </p><p> </p><p>A.9.Efficiency of Capital Markets and Portfolio </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Investment </p><p>---------- </p><p>29. Dutch financial markets are fully developed and </p><p>operate at market rates, facilitating the free flow of </p><p>financial resources.  The Netherlands is an </p><p>international financial center for the foreign exchange </p><p>market and for eurobonds and bullion trade.  The </p><p>flexibility that foreign companies enjoy in conducting </p><p>business in the Netherlands extends into the area of </p><p>currency and foreign exchange.  There are no </p><p>restrictions on foreign investors\' access to sources of </p><p>local finance. </p><p> </p><p>A.10.Political Violence </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>30. The Netherlands is noted for its stable political </p><p>environment. In the highly consensus-oriented Dutch </p><p>society, political violence is almost nonexistent.  The </p><p>Dutch economy derives much of its strength from a </p><p>stable industrial climate fostered by partnership </p><p>between unions, employers\' organizations and the </p><p>government.  Strikes are rarely regarded as the primary </p><p>means to settle labor disputes and labor strikes in </p><p>recent decades have been very rare. </p><p> </p><p>A.11. Corruption </p><p>---------------- </p><p>31. New anti-bribery legislation, implementing the 1997 </p><p>OECD anti-bribery convention, became effective in 2001. </p><p>The new anti-bribery law reconciles the language of the </p><p>OECD anti-bribery convention with the EU fraud </p><p>directive and the Council of Europe convention on </p><p>fraud.  It makes corruption by Dutch businessmen in </p><p>landing foreign contracts a penal offense, and bribes </p><p>are no longer deductible for corporate tax purposes. </p><p>At a national level, Dutch justice and interior </p><p>ministries have taken steps to sharpen regulations to </p><p>combat bribery in public procurement and in the </p><p>issuance of permits and subsidies.  This has led NGO </p><p>Transparency International to rank the Netherlands </p><p>number six among the least corrupted countries in the </p><p>world after Canada, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden and </p><p>Australia </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>B. Bilateral Investment Agreements </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>32. The Netherlands has signed bilateral investment </p><p>agreements with a large number of countries including: </p><p>Albania, Argentina, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belize, </p><p>Bolivia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina </p><p>Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde (Republic of), Chile, China, </p><p>Costa Rica, Cuba, Croatia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, </p><p>Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Gambia, Georgia, </p><p>Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, </p><p>Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, </p><p>Kenya, Korea (Republic of), Kuwait, Laos, Latvia, </p><p>Lebanon, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, </p><p>Moldova (Republic of), Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, </p><p>Namibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, </p><p>Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russian </p><p>Federation, Senegal, Singapore, Slovenia, Slovak </p><p>Republic, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tajikistan, </p><p>Tanzania, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, </p><p>Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen, </p><p>Yugoslavia, Zambia,  and Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>33. The Netherlands adheres to the OECD codes on </p><p>capital movements and invisible transactions, with the </p><p>exceptions mentioned earlier.  It maintains a treaty of </p><p>friendship, commerce and navigation with the United </p><p>States that generally provides for national treatment </p><p>and free entry for foreign investors, with certain </p><p>exceptions.  The Netherlands is also a member of the EU </p><p>single market. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>C. OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>34. Dutch companies investing in developing countries </p><p>through the establishment of subsidiaries or joint </p><p>ventures can insure their investment against </p><p>non-commercial risks with the privately-owned </p><p>Netherlands Credit Insurance Company (NCM) under the </p><p>1969 investment reinsurance act (WHI).  The NCM </p><p>reinsures its political risks with the Ministry of </p><p>Finance.  Dutch investors have not heavily utilized </p><p>this insurance program, however, and efforts are </p><p>underway to find ways of making the program more </p><p>effective. </p><p> </p><p>35. According to Article 7b of the investment </p><p>reinsurance act (WHI) of 1969, reinsurance of </p><p>investment in LDC\'s (Less Developed Countries) can be </p><p>provided only if a satisfactory agreement has been </p><p>reached with the recipient country regarding </p><p>regulations that will apply to Dutch investment in that </p><p>country.  The act covers procedures that will be </p><p>followed in the case of a dispute between the investor </p><p>and the host country on recovery of indemnity resulting </p><p>from the insurance of the investment.  A temporary </p><p>program (Thrio) covering the insurance of investment in </p><p>all Eastern and Central European countries, with the </p><p>exception of the former Yugoslavia and the Asian </p><p>republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States </p><p>(CIS) was introduced in 1991.  In 1997, the WHI and </p><p>Thrio programs were merged with similar programs for </p><p>developing countries into the Investment Reinsurance </p><p>Arrangement (IRA).  Investment in countries with which </p><p>the Netherlands has concluded a bilateral investment </p><p>treaty is eligible for coverage under the IRA.  The </p><p>Netherlands is a member of the Multilateral Investment </p><p>Guarantee Agency (MIGA). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>D. Labor </p><p>-------- </p><p>36. The Dutch workforce is largely well educated and </p><p>multilingual.  As a result of the current economic </p><p>downturn, employment growth has been decelerating which </p><p>has resulted in a steep increase in the level of </p><p>unemployment.  With an unemployment rate of 5.4 percent </p><p>in June of 2003 (up from 3.7 percent in May of 2002), </p><p>the official unemployment rate is climbing but remains </p><p>well below the EU average.  Stagnating employment </p><p>growth and a growing number of layoffs are expected to </p><p>raise the average unemployment rate to more than five </p><p>percent of the labor force in 2003, and to well over </p><p>six percent, and closer to the EU-15 average, in 2004. </p><p>Because of unfavorable labor market developments, the </p><p>Dutch government is giving the highest priority to </p><p>reducing structural unemployment, particularly long- </p><p>term unemployment, while boosting job creation. </p><p> </p><p>37. The Netherlands currently has the highest part-time </p><p>work rate in the OECD, which has contributed to greater </p><p>labor market flexibility.  A substantial increase in </p><p>the participation of women in the workforce led the </p><p>share of part-time workers in the total working </p><p>population to increase to more than 40 percent.  Labor </p><p>market participation, especially by elderly workers, is </p><p>slowly but gradually growing from a low of sixty </p><p>percent in the early 1990s to more than 70 percent of </p><p>the potential labor pool in 2004.  The high part-time </p><p>employment rate and low labor market participation are </p><p>the main factors contributing to less than full </p><p>utilization of labor potential.  Increasing labor </p><p>market participation is regarded as a critical to </p><p>ensure continued economic growth and to cope with the </p><p>impact of a rapidly graying population. </p><p> </p><p>38. The Dutch government\'s job creation policy is </p><p>focused on the following elements: reducing the general </p><p>burden of taxes and social security contributions, </p><p>moderating growth in wage levels, improving </p><p>productivity, and strengthening the economic structure. </p><p>In addition, the Dutch government has taken measures to </p><p>improve labor market flexibility.  This combination of </p><p>greater (but not full) labor market flexibility, </p><p>consensual wage restraint, and lowering of the tax </p><p>burden and social security contributions is seen as the </p><p>key to economic recovery. </p><p> </p><p>39. Workers may be found through government-operated </p><p>labor exchanges, a rapidly growing number of private </p><p>employment firms, or directly through, for example, </p><p>newspaper advertisements.  The official average </p><p>workweek currently is 38 hours, but work-shortening </p><p>programs (ADV) effectively reduce the average workweek </p><p>to 36 hours.  Cutting average working hours is often </p><p>used to create jobs or avoid layoffs.  Recently </p><p>concluded wage contracts include provisions for a 36- </p><p>hour workweek.  Also, the American business community </p><p>in the Netherlands has given cautious approval to </p><p>efforts to split the average 38-hour working week over </p><p>four instead of five days, and treat Saturday as a </p><p>normal working day.  This would help ease the country\'s </p><p>traffic-choked roads and allow companies to better </p><p>utilize their machinery.  On the other hand, new </p><p>legislation has been adopted which will increase the </p><p>flexibility in the operating hours of companies and </p><p>shops. </p><p>40. The average contract wage increase in 2002 was </p><p>close to four percent compared to an increase of </p><p>approximately five percent in 2001.  Counting on the </p><p>impact of a slowdown in the economy and sharply rising </p><p>unemployment to moderate wage demands, official </p><p>estimates optimistically expect the negotiated contract </p><p>wage rise in 2003 to stay just below three.  Labor </p><p>contracts for the year 2003 and 2004 concluded so far </p><p>provide for an average contract wage rise of 2.4 </p><p>percent.  The average per unit wage costs increase in </p><p>2003 is forecast to decelerate to a level below an </p><p>average 4.6 percent wage cost increase in 2002. </p><p>Surveys of average annual labor costs, base pay plus </p><p>employers\' social security costs, mandatory benefits </p><p>and voluntary benefits, across the European Union rank </p><p>the Netherlands ninth after countries such as the UK, </p><p>Germany, France, Sweden and Denmark. </p><p> </p><p>41. Benchmark reports by the European Industry </p><p>Federation UNICE observe that, despite relatively high </p><p>wage costs, the Netherlands has one of the highest </p><p>levels of labor productivity in the manufacturing </p><p>industry.  In order to reduce the gap between </p><p>productivity and wage costs the Dutch government has </p><p>significantly reduced employers\' costs for workers who </p><p>earn minimum wage or slightly above.  It has also </p><p>called on organizations of employers and workers to </p><p>create jobs at the lowest end of the wage scale. </p><p>Currently, the lowest wage established by collective </p><p>labor agreements (CAO\'s) is about eight percent higher </p><p>than the statutory minimum wage ($1,413 per month in </p><p>2002). </p><p> </p><p>42. Labor/management relations in both the public and </p><p>private sectors are generally good in a system that </p><p>emphasizes the concept of social partnership.  Although </p><p>wage bargaining in the Netherlands is increasingly </p><p>decentralized, there still exists a central bargaining </p><p>apparatus where labor contract guidelines are </p><p>established.  About 75 percent of all Dutch workers are </p><p>covered by union contracts that are negotiated on a by- </p><p>sector basis with employers associations and, if </p><p>accepted by the government, are extended by law to the </p><p>entire sector. Some sector labor contracts (e.g., road </p><p>transport and haulage) are relatively inexpensive, </p><p>while others (e.g., metal) are more costly.  To avoid </p><p>surprises, potential investors are advised to consult </p><p>with local trade unions to determine which, if any, </p><p>labor contracts apply to workers in their business </p><p>sector prior to making an investment decision. </p><p>Collective bargaining agreements negotiated in the past </p><p>few years have, by and large, been accepted by the rank </p><p>and file without much protest, despite only moderate </p><p>wage rises, and days lost to strikes are relatively </p><p>low. </p><p> </p><p>43. The Dutch have always had an economy that derives </p><p>its strength from free trade and a stable industrial </p><p>climate fostered by partnership between unions, </p><p>employers\' organizations and the government.  There is </p><p>substantial labor involvement in corporate </p><p>decision-making on matters affecting workers.  Each </p><p>company in the Netherlands with at least 50 workers is </p><p>required by law to institute a Works-Council with which </p><p>management must consult on a range of issues including </p><p>investment decisions.  Legislation implementing the EU </p><p>work council directive came into effect in March of </p><p>1998.  The Dutch government in 2003 agreed on </p><p>legislation governing employee participation of </p><p>European companies (companies operating in at least two </p><p>EU member states).  Under this legislation, company </p><p>founders and its workers must conclude an agreement on </p><p>employee participation.  Trade unions and management </p><p>are generally receptive to foreign investment, </p><p>especially where this leads to improved employment </p><p>possibilities and related benefits.  U.S. companies </p><p>generally perceive works councils as contributing to </p><p>management-worker relations and a benefit to the </p><p>company. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>E. Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>44. The Netherlands has no free trade zones or free </p><p>ports in the sense of territorial enclaves where </p><p>commodities can be processed or reprocessed tax-free. </p><p>There are, however, a large number of customs </p><p>warehouses (EU category a through e, but no category a </p><p>and f or "free zones") and free warehouses at </p><p>designated places and international airports where </p><p>goods in transit may be temporarily stored under </p><p>customs supervision.  Goods may be repacked, sorted or </p><p>relabeled. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>F. Foreign Direct Investment Statistics </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>45. Statistics on the level of FDI in the Netherlands </p><p>(by country of origin and industry sector), and </p><p>comparable data covering the stock of Dutch FDI abroad, </p><p>are compiled by the Netherlands Central Bank (NB) on an </p><p>ad hoc basis (http://www.dnb.nl).  The NB\'s FDI inflows </p><p>are based on sources of capital transactions rather </p><p>than on actual "by country" investment outlays. </p><p> </p><p>46. The FDI to GDP ratio in the Netherlands continues </p><p>to be among the highest in the European Union. The NB\'s </p><p>FDI statistics reveal that the total stock of FDI in </p><p>the Netherlands amounted to $350 billion, equal 74 </p><p>percent of GDP, at the end of 2002.  Sharing in the </p><p>global foreign direct investment slowdown, total FDI </p><p>inflows into the Netherlands in 2002 were almost halved </p><p>(down 45.7 percent) to seven percent of GDP, from well </p><p>over 13 percent in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>47. FDI from the U.S. in 2002 fell sharply to $ 7 </p><p>billion, from $ 24.8 billion in 2001.  The NB\'s FDI </p><p>statistics also show that reduced inflows of direct </p><p>investment and lower capital movements by non-bank </p><p>financial enterprises lowered the stock of U.S. direct </p><p>investment in the Netherlands to $74 billion, equal 16 </p><p>percent of GDP, in 2002 ($145.7 billion according to </p><p>U.S. Department of Commerce statistics).  This ranks </p><p>the United States as the largest supplier of direct </p><p>investment in the Netherlands. </p><p> </p><p>48. According to FDI statistics based on actual </p><p>investment outlays by country of origin during the </p><p>period 1987 through 2002, the Netherlands Foreign </p><p>Investment Agency (NFIA) was actively involved in the </p><p>establishment of close to 700 U.S. investment projects </p><p>with a total value of more than $5 billion.  The total </p><p>volume and value of direct investment projects for the </p><p>whole of 2002 is estimated to be somewhat higher than </p><p>the official number because the Netherlands has no </p><p>compulsory registration of foreign investment, and also </p><p>because there is a considerable amount of regional </p><p>investment acquisition. </p><p> </p><p>49. Foreign companies established in the Netherlands </p><p>account for roughly one-third of industrial production </p><p>and employment in industry.  At the end of 2002, about </p><p>25 percent of foreign establishments in the Netherlands </p><p>were of U.S. origin, 51 percent from the European </p><p>Union, 10 percent from other European countries, four </p><p>percent Japanese and the remaining 12 percent from </p><p>non-OECD and non-EU countries. </p><p> </p><p>50. The Netherlands is regarded as one of the most </p><p>attractive countries for setting up European </p><p>headquarters (EHQ\'s), call centers, shared services </p><p>centers (SSCs), and European distribution centers </p><p>(EDC\'s).  Of all foreign headquarters established in </p><p>Europe, close to 60 percent are located in the </p><p>Netherlands.  An estimated 25 percent of SSCs in Europe </p><p>have chosen to come to the Netherlands.  According to </p><p>the UK Data Monitor, the Netherlands currently also has </p><p>close to one thousand call centers within its borders, </p><p>many of which are located in the capital of Amsterdam. </p><p> </p><p>51. Amsterdam has also developed into the continent\'s </p><p>biggest data-communications infrastructure junction and </p><p>ICT center.  U.S. ICT companies including Cisco Systems </p><p>and MCI World Com have chosen to build their data </p><p>centers close to Amsterdam\'s fiber optic high-speed </p><p>data lines and its Gigaport broadband network. A </p><p>similar data-communications infrastructure junction and </p><p>ICT cluster, linking the Netherlands with the North of </p><p>Europe, has been established by U.S. company Tycom in </p><p>the city of Groningen in the north of the Netherlands. </p><p> </p><p>52. The Dutch also lead Europe in attracting </p><p>distribution centers.  An estimated 42 percent of U.S. </p><p>multinational companies have established a European </p><p>distribution center in the Netherlands.  U.S. companies </p><p>investing in the Netherlands have also been expanding </p><p>robustly in the micro-electronics field and value-added </p><p>logistics. </p><p> </p><p>53. According to the Netherlands Foreign Investment </p><p>Agency, computer manufacturers in particular are </p><p>looking to northern Europe to establish an assembly, </p><p>maintenance and distribution centers.  Packard Bell is </p><p>successfully operating a distribution center in the </p><p>city of Nijmegen, province of Gelderland, employing 500 </p><p>workers.  Technology wholesaler, Ingram Micro, </p><p>established a multi-million dollar regional </p><p>distribution center in the province of Limburg.  Other </p><p>large U.S. electronics firms with establishments in the </p><p>Netherlands are AT&T, Rank Xerox, IBM,and Honeywell. </p><p> </p><p>54. Abott Laboratories, manufacturer of infant formula </p><p>and medical nutritional food, has chosen the province </p><p>of Noord-Brabant as the place to invest $ 51 million in </p><p>a European distribution center. Abott Labs will be </p><p>following in the footsteps of Amgen Europe BV, leading </p><p>manufacturer of bio-pharmaceuticals, that has been </p><p>operating a European Logistical center in Noord-Brabant </p><p>since 1989. </p><p> </p><p>55. In the chemical sector, Lyondell Chemical Nederland </p><p>Ltd. is currently investing an estimated $1 billion in </p><p>a joint project with Bayer aimed at expanding Propylene </p><p>Oxide (PO)and Tertiary Butyl Alcohol production </p><p>capacity in the Port of Rotterdam Botlek area. </p><p> </p><p>56. The top fifteen U.S. investors in the Netherlands, </p><p>based on the number of employees (by company investment </p><p>outlays are protected) include Alcoa Europe Holding BV, </p><p>IBM Nederland NV, Sara Lee/DE NV, Dow Benelux NV, Du </p><p>Pont De Nemours Nederland BV, General Electric Plastics </p><p>Europe BV, Philip Morris Holland BV, Compaq Computer </p><p>BV, Cargill BV, Honeywell BV, Masterfoods Veghel BV, </p><p>Merck, Sharp & Dohme BV, Esso Nederland BV, Eastman </p><p>Chemical Europe BV, and Cisco Systems International BV. </p><p> </p><p>Russel </p><p></p></div>
