<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001416 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO - WILL IMBRIE </p><p>STATE FOR EB - TONY WAYNE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MCDONALD </p><p>USDOC FOR BERNARD CARREAU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, ETRD, ECON, EFIN, PREL, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: THE IMPORTANCE TO IRAQS POST-WAR ECONOMY </p><p>OF ENDING SANCTIONS NOW </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST:  ORHA believes that </p><p>its success in administering the newly liberated </p><p>Iraq will depend significantly on stimulating </p><p>early economic activity and sending a message of </p><p>hope for their economic future to the Iraqi </p><p>people.  ORHA proposes to encourage trade with, </p><p>and investment by, historic neighboring trade </p><p>partners as part of an effort to help "jump start" </p><p>Iraq\'s economy.  This cannot occur without lifting </p><p>United Nations and U.S. bilateral sanctions that </p><p>bar imports and exports to and from Iraq except </p><p>under the provisions of the Oil for Food program. </p><p>Accordingly, ORHA requests that Washington </p><p>agencies work with the international community to </p><p>end sanctions on Iraq\'s economy as soon as </p><p>possible. END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The strategic end state we seek in Iraq is: </p><p> </p><p>"A unified Iraq, with an Iraqi national identity </p><p>that respects tribal, ethnic and religious </p><p>heritages.  Governed by a broad-based, freely </p><p>elected government that adheres to the rule of </p><p>law, Iraq is neither a threat to the region nor a </p><p>supporter of WMD or terrorism.  The nation will </p><p>adopt and develop a viable, free market-based </p><p>economy." </p><p> </p><p>3.  ORHA (The Office of Reconstruction and </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance), led by LTG (R) Jay </p><p>Garner, and initially a component of the Coalition </p><p>Provisional Authority will work to return the </p><p>control of Iraq back to a duly constituted </p><p>government of Iraq as soon as possible.  ORHA may </p><p>be viewed as the first step in that process.  ORHA </p><p>is establishing itself in Baghdad and elsewhere in </p><p>Iraq as circumstances permit.  ORHA will address </p><p>immediate humanitarian assistance requirements and </p><p>will establish civil administration and </p><p>reconstruction priorities. </p><p> </p><p>4.  As noted above, a key reconstruction priority </p><p>is setting the stage for a free market-based </p><p>economy in Iraq.  ORHA recognizes that creating an </p><p>institutional and policy framework conducive to </p><p>the development of a free market-based economy, </p><p>led by the private sector, will require short, </p><p>medium and long-term efforts.   Many of the medium </p><p>(90 days to six months) and long-term efforts (six </p><p>months to two years) will entail international </p><p>assistance programs that will last beyond ORHA\'s </p><p>mandate.   In the short-term ORHA will focus on </p><p>actions that can stimulate activity in the Iraqi </p><p>economy and send a message of hope to the Iraqi </p><p>people for their economic future and enable Iraq\'s </p><p>private sector to start to contribute. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ORHA has developed an "Iraq Economic Jumpstart </p><p>Program."  The objective of the program is to </p><p>allow Iraqis to realize an immediate improvement </p><p>in their lives and to allow normal economic </p><p>activity to begin to operate during the first 90 </p><p>days.  The elements of the program include trade, </p><p>finance, investment, and other measures as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>-- Work with the international community to </p><p>quickly lift sanctions on trade, commerce, and </p><p>investment. </p><p> </p><p>-- Issue emergency payments of USD20 to all civil </p><p>servants who return to work. </p><p> </p><p>-- Place top priority on supplies of water, </p><p>electricity and fuel. </p><p> </p><p>-- Open borders to traditional trade partners. </p><p> </p><p>-- Declare a 90-day tariff holiday. </p><p> </p><p>-- Challenge all international assistance donors </p><p>to use Iraqi businesses and workers whenever </p><p>possible. </p><p> </p><p>-- Remove all barriers to internal trade except </p><p>safety and security standards. </p><p> </p><p>-- No currency will be denied validity including </p><p>the Iraqi Dinar, Old Iraqi (liberation) Dinar and </p><p>US Dollars with exchange rates determined by the </p><p>market. </p><p> </p><p>-- Immediate attention to restoring a functioning </p><p>banking system. </p><p> </p><p>-- Immediately assist Iraq in restoring relations </p><p>with the IMF and World Bank. </p><p> </p><p>-- Implement USAID and other USG assistance to </p><p>Iraqi businesses - e.g. USAID micro credit </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Trade and investment will be a key source of </p><p>reconstruction resources for Iraq.  To that end, </p><p>several of the elements of ORHA\'s "Economic </p><p>Jumpstart Program" focus on trade - open borders </p><p>for trade, a 90-day tariff holiday, removing </p><p>internal barriers, etc. </p><p> </p><p>7.  U.S. and United Nations sanctions against Iraq </p><p>make all trade with Iraq except as allowed via the </p><p>cumbersome mechanism of the Oil for Food program </p><p>contrary to international law.  Yet the </p><p>justification for such sanctions no longer exists </p><p>in the post Saddam regime era.  Economic sanctions </p><p>are central to the average Iraqis daily </p><p>perceptions.  Further, maintaining sanctions sends </p><p>the worst possible message to the average Iraqi </p><p>regarding the intent of the Coalition, the United </p><p>States and the international community. </p><p>Accordingly, ORHA urges that Washington agencies </p><p>work with the international community to end the </p><p>application of sanctions to trade by Iraqi </p><p>business and citizens as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
