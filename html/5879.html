<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000369 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, ETRD, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: LAGOS STATE GOVERNOR\'S VIEWS ON IRAQ, NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTIONS, AND AGOA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ACG ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Begin summary.  Lagos State Governor Tinubu told </p><p>ConGen and DAS Bridgewater February 16 that he has asked the </p><p>Lagos State Assembly to issue a resolution declaring that no </p><p>new construction be permitted along "Embassy Row" on </p><p>Victoria Island. Tinubu assured ConGen that he will do all he </p><p>can to ensure protection of consular and diplomatic personnel </p><p>in Lagos.  He shared our view that the dispute with Iraq </p><p>relates to weapons of mass destruction, not Islam, and he is </p><p>confident that most of his co-religionists share this view. </p><p>Tinubu pledged to work closely with the legislators who will </p><p>be elected or re-elected to the National Assembly to secure </p><p>passage of a customs bill, inaction on which has prevented </p><p>Nigeria from benefiting from AGOA.  Tinubu disclosed </p><p>antipathy for President Obasanjo, but praised Vice President </p><p>Atiku Abubakar, whom he has known for many years.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a luncheon for visiting DAS Pamela Bridgewater </p><p>February 16, Lagos State Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu assured </p><p>the DAS and accompanying ConGen that his office will do all </p><p>it can to ensure protection of the Consulate in the event of </p><p>war with Iraq. Tinubu added that he has asked the Lagos State </p><p>Assembly to issue a resolution declaring that no new </p><p>construction be permitted along "Embassy Row" on Victoria </p><p>Island. With a view to the longer term, he will seek the </p><p>Assembly\'s approval to designate the Walter Carrington </p><p>Crescent a diplomatic zone.  Such action would help ensure </p><p>the safety and security of diplomatic missions remaining in </p><p>Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Tinubu expressed concern about Al Queda\'s nominal </p><p>designation of Nigeria among the countries that need to be </p><p>liberated from the grasp of American imperialism. Tinubu </p><p>asserted that the vast majority of his fellow Muslims are </p><p>neither sympathetic to Baghdad nor extremist Muslims. </p><p>Nigeria\'s moderate Muslims have great sympathy for the </p><p>United States, he said, and they know that the issue between </p><p>Iraq and the United Nations relates to weapons of mass </p><p>destruction, not Islam.  The Governor said Al Queda\'s </p><p>message was meant for agitators who might jeopardize </p><p>Nigeria\'s unity and development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Regarding security in Nigeria, Tinubu said he expects </p><p>that even if war breaks out few people will be incited to </p><p>hold pro-Iraq or anti-US demonstrations in the southern </p><p>states, particularly Osun, Oyo and Lagos.  He said the </p><p>politicians do not want international politics to detract </p><p>from their mobilization efforts for the spring elections. </p><p>Tinubu (himself a Muslim) has been meeting with Muslim </p><p>leaders who will not support anti-US activities.  He promised </p><p>that any agitators would be "checkmated".  The situation is </p><p>different in northern Nigeria, he said, where it is </p><p>politically expedient for moderate politicians to support </p><p>Sharia.  He expects violent demonstrations specifically in </p><p>Kano, Kaduna and Jos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Tinubu senses that the United States has not </p><p>maintained the momentum in its positive engagement of Islam </p><p>that it had shown shortly after September 11, 2001. Lately, </p><p>US media outlets have not shown enough concern for Muslims in </p><p>the coverage of the impending conflict with Iraq.  US </p><p>coverage of the issue has been too intellectual when it is </p><p>very emotional in the Muslim world.   This fact has given </p><p>Iraq a propaganda edge over the US.  Tinubu perceives that </p><p>the USG has not done a very good job explaining its cause to </p><p>the Muslim world either.  Most Muslims, he said, believe </p><p>President Bush is "simply finishing his father\'s business." </p><p> Even Tinubu, a staunch US supporter, doubts the validity of </p><p>the US argument. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Turning to the presidential contest, Tinubu disclosed </p><p>that he does not like President Obasanjo because he </p><p>contributed to the end of democracy in Nigeria during his </p><p>tenure as a military president and is now benefiting from </p><p>that history.  That said, Tinubu admitted that he and his </p><p>party, the Alliance for Democracy, must support Obasanjo. </p><p>Southwest Nigeria is Yoruba land and the President is Yoruba. </p><p>Tinubu"s party had no choice since it has not fielded a </p><p>presidential candidate.  Moreover, Obasanjo is the only </p><p>candidate who stands a chance of blocking his rival, General </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari, whose ethnocentrism would jeopardize </p><p>Nigeria"s national unity.  Buhari and his ilk are agents of </p><p>destabilization who would be far worse than Obasanjo. Tinubu </p><p>and many other governors are therefore implementing a </p><p>strategy to re-elect Obasanjo, partly in an effort to prevent </p><p>Sharia from spreading. Tinubu predicted that the President </p><p>will follow his own course, if re-elected, since he will not </p><p>need as many friends the second time around. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Tinubu praised Vice President Atiku Abubakar, whom he </p><p>has known for many years. Tinubu warned that former military </p><p>strongman Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida and National Security </p><p>Advisor Aliyu Mohamed will try to discredit Atiku. That </p><p>effort will fail, Tinubu predicted, because Atiku has the </p><p>support of the governors and the National Assembly. </p><p>Elaborating on his knowledge of the VP, Tinubu said he has </p><p>known and understood the VP even before his entry into </p><p>politics. Atiku is a detribalized politician who knows where </p><p>he is going and how to build bridges to get there. Tinubu </p><p>expects Atiku will play a larger role in the next </p><p>presidential administration, especially in economic affairs, </p><p>while Obasasanjo will concentrate on external relations. </p><p>Atiku may also assume responsibility for other domestic </p><p>portfolios in the next administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Tinubu bemoaned the fact that Nigeria is not </p><p>benefiting from the textile provisions of the Africa Growth </p><p>and Opportunity Act, and claimed partial responsibility for </p><p>this situation.  He said he had not pressed his fellow </p><p>governors to exert pressure on the national legislators for </p><p>enactment of a customs bill mandating country-of-origin </p><p>certification of inputs that might go into Nigerian textile </p><p>exports to the United States.  Since Lagos State </p><p>manufacturers could benefit substantially from the AGOA </p><p>textile provisions, Tinubu plans to press for quick passage </p><p>of the customs bill.  He believes the next legislature will </p><p>passed it soon after it convenes in late spring 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Bio comment.  Tinubu is direct, articulate, and a </p><p>sharp analyst who understands accommodation.  He acknowledges </p><p>the imperative of political compromise in the game for power, </p><p>even with political actors whom he might be inclined to </p><p>denigrate. Tinubu credits his going into politics to Atiku\'s </p><p>personal encouragement.  Tinubu\'s admiration of Atiku </p><p>suggests that the Governor could be persuaded to play a </p><p>national role in an Atiku administration if the VP were </p><p>elected president four years hence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) DAS Bridgewater did not clear this cable before her </p><p>departure from post. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
