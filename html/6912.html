<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0089 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MARCH 28, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for March 28, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Sabah: It is estimated that there are 3,000 </p><p>PKK/KADEK militants at "Mahmur Camp" in northern </p><p>Iraq just south of the 36th parallel. The PKK </p><p>authorities have been sending messages recently </p><p>through Kurdish groups in northern Iraq to the US </p><p>so that the coalition forces would not bomb them. </p><p>The PKK claims the presence of many civilians in </p><p>the camp. It is believed that Celal Talabani and </p><p>Mesut Barzani are conveying the PKK\'s message to </p><p>US forces. The PKK fears meeting the same fate as </p><p>the al-Qaida-affiliated Al-Ansar organization </p><p>that has been bombed by the US in Halabja. </p><p>Sources in Washington have reported that the US </p><p>has just started thinking about what to do about </p><p>the camps like "Mahmur." The "Kurdish Summit" in </p><p>Ankara being chaired by President Bush\'s special </p><p>envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, agreed upon ending the </p><p>terrorist activities of all terrorist groups in </p><p>the region. An anonymous US official said </p><p>Washington accepted PKK/KADEK as a terrorist </p><p>organization but so far US military forces have </p><p>only bombed Al-Ansar and Komala camps in Halabja. </p><p>What will happen to the PKK camps is going to </p><p>become a serious examination for Turkey-US </p><p>relations. The US has three options, according to </p><p>reports. </p><p>(1) To bomb the PKK/KADEK camp, given that the </p><p>organization is officially recognized as a </p><p>terrorist organization by Department of State. </p><p>(2) To disarm the militants in the camp and </p><p>surrender them to Turkish authorities who could </p><p>grant them an amnesty. </p><p>(3) To not touch the PKK/KADEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Milliyet: The US troops deployed at Mardin\'s </p><p>Industrial Zone were put on alert when they </p><p>received a suicide car bomb threat. The soldiers </p><p>have been reinforcing security at the base. The </p><p>soldiers scan the base perimeter with projectors </p><p>and use night-vision binoculars. Soldiers pointed </p><p>their guns at a DHA (Dogan News Agency) reporter </p><p>who wanted to take pictures; the stand-off was </p><p>ended after a US military officer checked the </p><p>journalist ID card. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Bolge: KESK (Public Employees Unions </p><p>Confederation) and Adana Chapter Platform members </p><p>held an anti-war protest meeting at Ugur Mumcu </p><p>Square by the Railway Station in Adana.  KESK </p><p>affiliates also marched past the Consulate, </p><p>shouting slogans, e.g. "Murderer America, Get Out </p><p>of Turkey." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Evrensel: An anti-war demonstration drew </p><p>participation of 100 people in Adiyaman. The </p><p>participants shouted slogans such as "Damn US </p><p>Imperialism," "Budget not for war but education," </p><p>and "US the murderer, AKP the collaborator." In </p><p>the southeast, smaller but similar demonstrations </p><p>took place in Tunceli, Malatya, Elazig, and </p><p>Mersin, as well.  Milliyet: In addition to two Dutch </p><p>Patriot Missile Batteries at the 2nd Tactical Air </p><p>Base in Diyarbakir, two US Patriot Missile Batteries </p><p>and 200 soldiers arrived yesterday. It is anticipated </p><p>that one of the batteries will be deployed in </p><p>Mardin, where the US has established a logistical </p><p>support center. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Cumhuriyet: Because Turkey announced refugee- </p><p>flow would be a reason for a Turkish incursion in </p><p>northern Iraq, Kurdish groups there have decided </p><p>to send refugees to Iran and Syria instead, if </p><p>unable to cope with refugees internally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Radikal: Because it is anticipated that the </p><p>Iraqi government would cut the electricity </p><p>supplied from Baghdad to Zakho, a team of eight </p><p>electricians was dispatched from Batman to </p><p>northern Iraq to assess the situation.  Officials </p><p>announced that they were waiting for instructions </p><p>from the Ministry of Energy for providing </p><p>electricity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Milliyet: It is reported that the </p><p>Coordinating Governor of Diyarbakir, Nusret </p><p>Miroglu, has in hand "a blank check" to cope with </p><p>any refugee problems that might erupt.  It is </p><p>reported that some 3,000 refugees would be able </p><p>to go to European countries, via a procedure, </p><p>which Turkey would arrange, by land and air and </p><p>sea, primarily to Belgium, France, Holland, and </p><p>Denmark. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Radikal/Hurriyet/Cumhuriyet: The European </p><p>Commission announced it is interested in the </p><p>retrials at the Ankara State Security Court (SSC) </p><p>of (now-defunct) DEP party former Turkish </p><p>parliamentary deputies Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, </p><p>Orhan Dogan, and Selim Sadak. The Commission\'s </p><p>announcement said the cases would be followed </p><p>very closely and reiterated the importance it </p><p>attaches to "freedom of expression and </p><p>association" and its application in practice in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Milliyet:  With regard to the DEP deputies </p><p>trial, it is reported that 17 members of the </p><p>Babat clan, who had previously given testimony </p><p>against the former deputies, had decided not to </p><p>appear in court, despite summons sent by the SSC. </p><p>The witnesses reportedly stated that they could </p><p>make their statements via letters rogatory, but </p><p>the European Human Rights Court had instructed </p><p>the SSC that presence of the witnesses was </p><p>required. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Milliyet/Turkiye: The Hungarian Ambassador </p><p>to Turkey, Zsolt Szalay, has been visiting the </p><p>Cukurova Region to evaluate its economic </p><p>potential for promoting economic ties. The </p><p>Ambassador visited Adana\'s Chamber of Commerce, </p><p>Chamber of Industry, Commodities Exchange, </p><p>Governorate, and Organized Industrial Zone.  He </p><p>announced that a large Hungarian Trade Delegation </p><p>would hold a meeting in Istanbul on May 15 to </p><p>focus on how to increase trade volume between the </p><p>two countries. </p><p>12.  Turkiye/Milli Gazete: TEK, the Turkish </p><p>Electricity Distribution Company, sued 5 township </p><p>and 8 district municipalities in Malatya province </p><p>for not paying electric bills in the amount of </p><p>USD one million. TEK is demanding confiscation of </p><p>the assets of the municipalities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Bolge: Thanks to efforts by Adana AKP </p><p>Provincial Chairman and eight deputies from the </p><p>region, crop dusters that had been banned from </p><p>flying, due to the war on Iraq, have now been </p><p>granted permission to fly again, for the purpose </p><p>of dusting wheat fields with pesticides. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
