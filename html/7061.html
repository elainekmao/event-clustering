KELLY/PALMER E-MAIL 03/21/03 </p><p>     F. 02 TEGUCIGALPA 3318 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer; Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary.  Ambassador met April 1 with Honduran </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Guillermo Perez-Cadalso to </p><p>discuss a wide range of issues, with a focus on Iraq and </p><p>combating terrorism.  Ambassador urged the GOH to make </p><p>stronger public statements on Iraq, including on Iraqi war </p><p>crimes, and criticized the recent statement by the Honduran </p><p>UN PermRep as "empty."  Perez-Cadalso said that the GOH would </p><p>definitely provide troops to support the U.S. in post-war </p><p>Iraq, and pledged to work with the Ministry of Defense to get </p><p>a formal letter offering support to the USG.  Ambassador </p><p>pressed the FM on the need to ratify the ICC Article 98 </p><p>Agreement with the U.S., sign/ratify five outstanding UN and </p><p>two OAS counterterrorism conventions/protocols, and support </p><p>the USG candidacy for the UNESCO Executive Board.  The FM </p><p>pledged that the GOH would support the final draft of the </p><p>UNCHR resolution on Cuba, reiterated the GOH\'s desire for an </p><p>18-month extension of TPS, and noted the tougher language in </p><p>the 2002 Human Rights Report on extrajudicial killings and </p><p>corruption in Honduras.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador and PolOff met April 1 with Honduran </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Guillermo Perez-Cadalso Arias at </p><p>the MFA to discuss Iraq and other key issues.  The meeting </p><p>followed the Ambassador\'s March 28 meeting with Honduran </p><p>President Ricardo Maduro (septel). </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: GOH Needs to be Publicly Supportive </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador thanked FM Perez-Cadalso for the GOH\'s </p><p>support for the U.S. as a member of the Coalition of the </p><p>Willing on Iraq.  The Foreign Minister said that he was the </p><p>highest ranking representative of foreign governments in </p><p>attendance at a recent briefing at the State Department for </p><p>representatives of the coalition, during his recent trip to </p><p>Washington (ref E).  Ambassador told the FM that the USG was </p><p>not happy with Honduran UN PermRep Manuel Acosta Bonilla\'s </p><p>statement during the March 26 United Nations Security Council </p><p>open debate on Iraq.  It was a weak and empty statement that </p><p>did not show support for the USG position on Iraq, said the </p><p>Ambassador.  Ambassador emphasized that he had already </p><p>discussed with President Maduro March 28 the USG\'s </p><p>disappointment with the statement (septel).  Ambassador told </p><p>FM Perez-Cadalso that the USG needed stronger support from </p><p>coalition partners, and urged the GOH to speak out publicly </p><p>in support of U.S. policy on Iraq.  Perez-Cadalso made it </p><p>clear that he had gotten the message, but he neither </p><p>criticized the PermRep nor pledged to make a more forceful </p><p>public statement on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador reiterated that the USG was watching </p><p>closely Honduran statements, or lack thereof, on Iraq.  The </p><p>comparison with El Salvador, which has made repeated public </p><p>statements of support on U.S. Iraq policy, already offered </p><p>troops in a post-war Iraq, and has ratified virtually all </p><p>counterterrorism conventions, was not favorable to Honduras. </p><p>Ambassador said he understood that the war was a potentially </p><p>difficult issue for the GOH, but emphasized that the neutral </p><p>UN statement by the Honduran PermRep was seen by the USG as a </p><p>lost opportunity for the GOH to publicly support U.S. policy </p><p>on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Iraqi War Crimes - FM Asks for Written Material </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Ambassador delivered ref C demarche on Iraqi war </p><p>crimes, which PolOff had delivered March 31 to MFA DG for </p><p>Foreign Policy AMB Mario Fortin.  The FM asked for a brief </p><p>written report from the U.S. detailing the points raised by </p><p>the Ambassador.  Perez-Cadalso said that the GOH needed this </p><p>before making any statement to the press.  Ambassador said </p><p>that the Embassy would request it from the Department.  Post </p><p>has since asked WHA/CEN to find out when the "public </p><p>diplomacy package" on this issue mentioned in the cable will </p><p>be ready to give to Posts to release to host governments and </p><p>the press, and if there was anything in the meantime that the </p><p>Department can provide posts for use as a non-paper or fact </p><p>sheet to the GOH, preferably in Spanish (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>Honduras Will Offer Troops for Post-War Iraq </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Ambassador raised the issue of possible GOH </p><p>participation in post-war "phase IV" operations in Iraq, </p><p>saying that both President Maduro (septel) and Minister of </p><p>Defense Fred Breve had previously given the Embassy </p><p>indications of support.  Ambassador emphasized that the USG </p><p>needed a formal written offer of support from the GOH </p><p>detailing the kind of assistance the GOH was prepared to </p><p>provide.  Perez-Cadalso said that the answer was yes, the GOH </p><p>would provide troops, and that he would talk with MOD Breve </p><p>and work on getting a formal offer of support to the USG. </p><p> </p><p>ICC Article 98 Agreement: Congress a Potential Problem </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) When asked about the status of ratifying the ICC </p><p>Article 98 Agreement between the U.S. and Honduras, </p><p>Perez-Cadalso confirmed that it had not yet been sent to </p><p>congress for approval.  The FM said it was a difficult time, </p><p>given the ongoing war in Iraq, for the GOH to seek </p><p>congressional approval of this controversial agreement. </p><p>Ambassador underlined that the USG would remember favorably </p><p>countries that stood by the U.S. during the war in Iraq, and </p><p>noted that this support might include taking tough steps such </p><p>as this.  Perez-Cadalso asked Ambassador for USG assistance </p><p>to urge Congress, especially the opposition Liberal Party, to </p><p>support approval of the agreement.  Ambassador said that the </p><p>Embassy would be happy to talk to congressional leaders about </p><p>the importance of approving the agreement.  (Note:  The </p><p>Liberal Party is opposed to U.S. policy on Iraq. </p><p>Perez-Cadalso evidently believes that this may fuel potential </p><p>Liberal Party opposition to an ICC Article 98 Agreement. </p><p>Post notes that the GOH had months since the September 19, </p><p>2002 signing of the agreement in which the GOH could have </p><p>introduced the agreement to congress for approval prior to </p><p>the start of the war in Iraq.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Honduras Moving Slowly on Counterterrorism Conventions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Ambassador gave the FM a Spanish-language copy of </p><p>the IAEA\'s 1980 Convention on the Physical Protection on </p><p>Nuclear Materials (which WHA/CEN had obtained with the </p><p>assistance of NP/NE and U.S. Mission Vienna).  PolOff told </p><p>the FM that the Embassy hoped to soon have Spanish-language </p><p>texts of the two ICAO and two IMO counterterrorism (CT) </p><p>conventions/protocols also outstanding.  (In fact, with the </p><p>assistance of IO and Embassy London, WHA/CEN obtained copies </p><p>of the two IMO CT conventions/protocols which Post sent to </p><p>the FM April 2.  Post now only needs the two ICAO </p><p>conventions/protocols, with the assistance of ConGen </p><p>Montreal.)  This was in addition to the Spanish-language </p><p>texts of the two OAS CT conventions (obtained by WHA/CEN with </p><p>the help of WHA/USOAS and delivered to the FM during WHA DAS </p><p>Fisk\'s February 6 meeting with him.) which the FM claimed </p><p>would soon be sent to congress for approval.  Ambassador made </p><p>clear the USG\'s desire that Honduras sign and/or ratify all </p><p>seven outstanding CT conventions as quickly as possible.  The </p><p>FM told Ambassador that the CT conventions would not be </p><p>controversial in Congress, but blamed the Casa Presidencial </p><p>for some of the delay in forwarding the CT conventions to </p><p>congress.  (Note:  The DCM has raised the issue of the CT </p><p>conventions/protocols with Minister of the Presidency Luis </p><p>Cosenza in a March 12 meeting and a March 28 letter.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>GOH Will Support Final Draft of UNCHR Resolution on Cuba </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>9. (C) In response to Ambassador\'s request for the GOH to </p><p>co-sponsor the United Nations Commission on Human Rights </p><p>(UNCHR) resolution on Cuba (as it had done in 2002), the FM </p><p>said that his understanding was that the Peruvian draft </p><p>resolution was still circulating for comments.  Once the </p><p>draft was finalized, Perez-Cadalso said that the GOH would </p><p>support it.  AMB Fortin told PolOff April 1 that the GOH had </p><p>a copy of a draft resolution sponsored by Peru, Costa Rica, </p><p>and Nicaragua. </p><p> </p><p>UNESCO Executive Board - Noncommittal Response from FM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Ambassador demarched FM on the upcoming re-entry of </p><p>the U.S. into UNESCO, and urged the GOH to support the USG </p><p>candidacy for the UNESCO Executive Board as requested in a </p><p>dip note.  Perez-Cadalso was noncommittal.  PolOff, who had </p><p>previously demarched AMB Fortin on the issue (ref D), called </p><p>Fortin after the meeting to confirm that the scheduled date </p><p>for the election was October 10, 2003, in response to a </p><p>question from the FM, who mentioned that the Honduran </p><p>Ambassador in Geneva would be changing prior to October. </p><p> </p><p>TPS - GOH Makes Another Plea for 18 Month Extension </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Ambassador gave Perez-Cadalso a copy of the letter </p><p>from the Secretary to the FM on the Honduran request for an </p><p>extension of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Hondurans, </p><p>that thanked Perez-Cadalso for his March 18 letter and </p><p>explained that a decision was pending (ref A).  The FM </p><p>reiterated that the GOH was seeking an 18-month extension of </p><p>TPS.  The Ambassador said that he would relay this request to </p><p>Washington. </p><p> </p><p>FM Notes Criticism in Human Rights Report </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Ambassador gave FM a copy of the final version of </p><p>the Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Honduras for </p><p>2002.  PolOff had given an embargoed copy to AMB Fortin March </p><p>31, which the FM said he had skimmed that afternoon. </p><p>Perez-Cadalso noted that the criticism on extrajudicial </p><p>killings and corruption was somewhat tougher than the 2001 </p><p>report, and said that the timing of the release of the report </p><p>was difficult.  He said that it was difficult for the GOH to </p><p>be criticized by the USG at the same time it was supporting </p><p>the U.S. on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>MFA Gets the Message on Iraq </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (S) Comment.  FM Perez-Cadalso understood Ambassador\'s </p><p>direct message that the GOH, as a member of the coalition, </p><p>needed to express its public support for U.S. policy on Iraq </p><p>in a more forceful manner.  His definitive answer that the </p><p>GOH would provide troops in some capacity for post-war Iraq </p><p>was positive, but his failure to pledge to make a more </p><p>forceful public statement on Iraq was not.  On most issues </p><p>the MFA is a cautious institution, and Perez-Cadalso is often </p><p>an embodiment of that caution.  He has not taken any bold </p><p>initiatives as Foreign Minister but has conscientiously </p><p>carried out Maduro Administration foreign policies.  It is </p><p>important to note that he is not a member of the tight Maduro </p><p>inner circle.  (In fact, his removal has been the subject of </p><p>ongoing speculation since December 2002.)  Nevertheless, Post </p><p>believes that Perez-Cadalso and President Maduro understand </p><p>that as a member of the coalition on Iraq, the GOH needs to </p><p>make bolder public statements.  End Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
