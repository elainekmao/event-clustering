(U) On February 18, Turkish financial markets continued </p><p>to ignore the news of a deadlock in negotiations over a U.S. </p><p>assistance package:  the lira appreciated nearly one percent </p><p>to close at TL 1,626,000 from yesterday\'s TL 1.642,000); </p><p>TL-denominated T-bills dropped one percentage point to 57 </p><p>percent compounded; the Istanbul Stock Exchange was up 4 </p><p>percent (and up 2.5 percent February 17).  Bond and stock </p><p>market transactional volume February 18 was quite strong </p><p>(bond was nearly one quadrillion, stocks was TL 700 </p><p>trillion). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) JP Morgan/Chase\'s local bond trader Sinan Gumisdis </p><p>explained to us the sentiment as follows:  "market players </p><p>see a few more days of tough bargaining (between the U.S. and </p><p>Turkey), but a positive result by week\'s end, based on the </p><p>perception that both sides want a deal."  Sinan says the </p><p>Turkish corporate sector had already hedged its lira </p><p>positions (manufacturers relying on imports have already </p><p>imported several months worth in advance; exporters are </p><p>holding onto their dollars).  He concluded that if there\'s no </p><p>deal by early next week, sentiment will change. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) analyst Murat Golkan </p><p>of Bender Securities said the ISE rally over past two days is </p><p>being driven by foreign buyers, including "quality" </p><p>longer-term institutions (not just the in-and-out hedge </p><p>funds).  Golkan said leaks of cross-conditionality between </p><p>the U.S. package and IMF program is seen as very encouraging, </p><p>since "everyone knows by now that AK would squander the money </p><p>if it could." Goldman Sachs Turkey analyst told us separately </p><p>that he agreed clear reform conditionality, especially on </p><p>ongoing fiscal adjustments, was key to market acceptance of </p><p>the U.S. package. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Some Progress on 2003 Budget </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The GOT has made some progress in meeting the 6.5 </p><p>percent primary surplus target, according to Ministry of </p><p>Finance Deputy DG for budget Ahmet Kesik (though IMF and </p><p>World Bank reps are more negative, see below).  Kesik told us </p><p>February 18 that the GOT and IMF teams are agreed on measures </p><p>that result in a primary surplus of about 5.4 percent of GNP. </p><p> The largest issue outstanding is IMF and World Bank </p><p>opposition to the GOT proposal to delay into 2004 the "Direct </p><p>Income Support" payments to farmers originally budgeted for </p><p>2003, which amounts to about TL 1.5 quadrillion or about 0.4 </p><p>percent of GNP, per Kesik.   He added that senior bureaucrats </p><p>are urging the Cabinet to reach closure with the IMF this </p><p>week, in order to get the draft 2003 budget submitted to </p><p>parliament by early next week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) World Bank Operations Director Zeillon confirmed </p><p>that delaying the direct income support (DIS) program was a </p><p>serious problem for the Bank, and would endanger pending Bank </p><p>loan tranches (nearly $1 billion now scheduled for end </p><p>March).  In effect it rolls back this key reform, which is a </p><p>more efficient way of supporting farmers, in favor of the </p><p>traditional Turkish practice of discretionary price supports </p><p>for certain products (e.g., hazelnuts and tobacco) which AK </p><p>is reviving.  Zeillon said this belies the AK slogan of </p><p>increasing social spending for the poor, since DIS targets </p><p>the poorest farmers, while AK has focused instead on middle </p><p>class spending measures such as increasing the civil service </p><p>pension fund. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) IMF resrep also confirmed that the primary surplus </p><p>shortfall is now about 1.1 percent of GNP, that the DIS delay </p><p>(which he said would in effect cancel the program) is a major </p><p>issue of contention.  He did note that the GOT had agreed to </p><p>include in the definition of primary surplus some TL 2.7 </p><p>quadrillion (about 0.75 percent of GNP) of in-kind foreign </p><p>suppliers\' credits (used, e.g., for the GOT to import </p><p>construction and medical equipment).  IMF resrep said the IMF </p><p>team has a meeting late February 18 with State Minister </p><p>Babacan, and that he would brief us on the results February </p><p>19. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
