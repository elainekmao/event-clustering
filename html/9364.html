<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 003251 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, T, AND PM/B </p><p>NSC FOR THEROUX </p><p>DOD FOR OSD/ISA/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 07/12/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KTIA, KICC, PGOV, PARM, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAEG WANTS ARTICLE 98 DVC ON JULY 16 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by A/DCM Katherine Van De Vate, for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and Action Request:  The UAE Ministry of </p><p>Justice is eager to hold a digital videoconference on the </p><p>U.S.-UAE Article 98 agreement and is proposing July 16 for </p><p>the date.  The relevant Ministry of Justice personnel will </p><p>not be in the country after the end of this week.  We </p><p>request that Washington participants see if it is possible </p><p>to hold a DVC on July 16.  Otherwise it is likely that the </p><p>discussions will slip until September.  Post hopes to have </p><p>this signed late September/early October and would, </p><p>therefore, appreciate efforts to hold the DVC on the 16th. </p><p>End Summary and Action Request. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Ambassador met with UAE Minister of Justice, </p><p>Islamic Affairs, and Awqaf Mohamed Nakhera Al-Dhaheri on </p><p>July 13.  The Minister raised a number of questions that </p><p>the UAEG has about the proposed text.  The Ambassador </p><p>suggested that these would be best raised with the </p><p>appropriate USG officials in a digital videoconference. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The issues are: </p><p>-- The UAEG is concerned about the text that states the USG </p><p>and the UAEG have each "expressed their intention to </p><p>investigate and to prosecute where appropriate acts within </p><p>the jurisdiction" of the ICC.  The UAEG is concerned that </p><p>the phrase "where appropriate" leaves open the possibility </p><p>that allegations would not be investigated. The Ambassador </p><p>explained that USG concerns relate specifically to </p><p>politically motivated attacks on U.S. personnel. </p><p> </p><p>--The UAEG proposed that the agreement should cover </p><p>nationals of each party only.   The Ambassador noted that </p><p>the U.S. military has a number of non-Amcits serving. </p><p> </p><p>--The Minister also asked for an explanation of the </p><p>statement "current and former" military personnel.  He </p><p>asked whether this meant that former military personnel </p><p>traveling to the UAE on private business or tourism would </p><p>be protected under the agreement. </p><p> </p><p>--The Minister explained the UAEG rationale for deleting </p><p>paragraph 6 of the text that says "This agreement shall </p><p>remain in force.."  The UAEG position is that this is not </p><p>being negotiated as an "agreement," but as an exchange of </p><p>diplomatic notes, and therefore, calling it an agreement is </p><p>inappropriate.  The Ambassador suggested that the UAEG </p><p>provide alternate language, and the Minister agreed. </p><p> </p><p>5 (U) Econchief followed up with Abdul Rahim Al-Awadi, </p><p>Undersecretary for International Cooperation and Planning </p><p>at the Ministry of Justice, to provide him with </p><p>Department\'s suggested dates (July 22-23, 29-30).  Al-Awadi </p><p>told Econchief that these dates would not be possible for </p><p>the UAEG and proposed that the DVC be held on July 16. </p><p>Post strongly supports the UAEG suggested date.  We hope to </p><p>have negotiations concluded quickly in order to have the </p><p>signing ceremony by the end of September/early October to </p><p>coincide with the annual strategic partnership meeting to </p><p>be held in Abu Dhabi at that time. </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
