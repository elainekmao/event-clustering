SUMMARY.  Labor conditions at the qualifying industrial </p><p>zones (QIZs) are satisfactory and tending toward improvement. </p><p> The QIZs continue to grow, resulting in increased demand for </p><p>labor, and the demand for trained domestic labor is pressing. </p><p> Foreign source labor, especially within the textile sector, </p><p>remains relatively high at about 30% of the QIZ workforce. </p><p>Improving domestic productivity and cost advantages of </p><p>domestic labor, if coupled with badly needed vocational </p><p>training, may eventually push down the demand for foreign </p><p>laborers.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>VISITS TO QIZS REVEAL IMPRESSIVE GROWTH AND PRODUCTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  On June 30, the Ambassador and emboffs visited the Al </p><p>Tajammouat QIZ, which is located approximately 30 minutes </p><p>south of Amman.  The Ambassador toured three QIZ factories, </p><p>escorted by Park Manager Halim Safiti.  According to Safiti, </p><p>there are 20 QIZ-inspired factories in Al Tajammouat, of </p><p>which 17 are currently operational.  These factories employ </p><p>7,000 laborers, and Salfiti expects that number to reach </p><p>10,000 by the end of 2002.  70% of the work force is </p><p>domestic, over 95% are women, and most come from East Amman, </p><p>Zarqa and Madaba.  The tour of the factories was impressive; </p><p>rows upon rows of Jordanian women, mostly dressed in </p><p>conservative/traditional attire, working with sewing machines </p><p>and other textile equipment.  Labor conditions at these </p><p>plants are good.  Workspaces are clean and well lit, exits </p><p>are clearly marked and workers seemed to be in good spirits. </p><p>In one factory, the temperature was a bit high, and Safiti </p><p>took the Ambassador\'s suggestion that the plant look into </p><p>more effective cooling equipment.  According to Safiti, </p><p>salaries of the workers at some of these plants are 20% above </p><p>minimum wage (which is currently 80 JD per month), with </p><p>incentive programs for superior quality/quantity production. </p><p>(Note:  There has been some concern expressed by embassy </p><p>contacts to COMMOFF regarding workers at this QIZ being paid </p><p>at less than minimum wage). </p><p> </p><p>3.  On July 7, poloff met with Fathallah Omrani, President of </p><p>the Union of Workers in Textile Garment and Clothing </p><p>Industries, at the Al Husn QIZ, located near the city of </p><p>Irbid.  (Note:  Omrani is a long-time contact of the embassy </p><p>and will be traveling to Washington July 12 for consultations </p><p>with the ILO, labor NGOs and USG officials).  Omrani escorted </p><p>poloff through two factories - owned by Tefron and Century </p><p>Wear.  Both of these factories operate exclusively with </p><p>Jordanian labor, and are under contract with Victoria\'s </p><p>Secret, Gap, and Calvin Klein.  The factories employ 300 and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>2100 workers, respectively.  Century Wear plant manager Jamil </p><p>Karka explained that there is such a surplus of (untrained) </p><p>labor in the Irbid area that he could "hire 500 workers </p><p>tomorrow if he had the extra capacity to do so". </p><p> </p><p>4.  The floors of the Al-Husn factories are air conditioned </p><p>(while the managerial offices were not), and were at full </p><p>capacity.  They are well lit, clean, and workers have access </p><p>to fresh water and clean bathrooms.  Exits are clearly </p><p>marked.  Salaries at these factories were at minimum wage (80 </p><p>JD), with incentive programs that push the average monthly </p><p>wage to over 100 JD per month.  Karka was proud to say that </p><p>his factory has one of the best reputations for labor </p><p>conditions in Jordan, and Omrani confirmed this.  Century </p><p>Wear\'s factory employs higher labor standards, not only </p><p>because of the self-asserted magnanimous nature of Karka, but </p><p>because US companies expect enhanced labor standards.  Omrani </p><p>commented that US companies are most vigilant regarding the </p><p>issue of labor conditions at the QIZ factories and as a </p><p>result, laborers at these factories enjoy better conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>UNION BOSS SETS UP HEALTH CLINIC </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Following the tour of the factories, Omrani escorted </p><p>poloff to a recently opened health clinic that serves workers </p><p>of the QIZs in Al-Husn  The health clinic was funded with a </p><p>USD 92000 grant from the Government of Japan.  The clinic </p><p>employs 7 doctors (one of whom is a dentist) and provides </p><p>basic check-ups and examinations to workers and their </p><p>families.  All workers, regardless of union membership, may </p><p>receive free treatment at the clinic, and family of union </p><p>members will also be able to receive free treatment soon. </p><p>Omrani has arranged for 9 of the QIZ textile companies at </p><p>Al-Husn to contribute 1 JD per month per worker to the clinic </p><p>in order to allow it to sustain operations.  In its first six </p><p>months, the clinic provided treatment to nearly 5000 workers, </p><p>and has operated with a small surplus.  Omrani hopes to </p><p>secure funding for a similar clinic at the QIZ near Zarqa </p><p>soon. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>EFFECTIVE VOCATIONAL TRAINING NEEDED DESPERATELY </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  Poloff met on June 13 with Abdel Abdel Jaber, Assistant </p><p>Director General for Technical Affairs at the GOJ\'s </p><p>Vocational Training Corporation.  Abdel Jaber is directing a </p><p>program through which 12000 Jordanians will receive </p><p>vocational training subsequent to a three month tour in the </p><p>Jordanian Army.  Abdel Jaber said that his program had </p><p>attracted over 40000 applicants, and that the VTC has, in the </p><p>past, placed over 80% of trainees in jobs, including </p><p>approximately 60% in jobs related to their vocational </p><p>training.  There are 30 vocational training subjects in which </p><p>trainees may study, and there are plans afoot to open centers </p><p>throughout Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Although the GOJ has recognized the pressing need for </p><p>expanded vocational training, both labor leaders and plant </p><p>managers criticized the VTC as a clunky and ineffective </p><p>bureaucratic mechanism.  According to managers at Al </p><p>Tajammouat, the VTC "misses the mark" by training workers in </p><p>fields for which there is no demand.  Omrani commented that </p><p>while the VTC places laborers into employment, these workers </p><p>generally do not last, largely because the VTC provides </p><p>outdated or poor training.  Companies often train their own </p><p>work force; at Tefron one of fourteen production lines is </p><p>dedicated to trainees.  The trainees spend an average of two </p><p>months on the training line before joining the work force. </p><p>Results have been good, but the demand for trained labor at </p><p>the QIZs far exceeds the currently available supply.  This is </p><p>why, Omrani explains, companies look eastward to China and </p><p>Sri Lanka for trained workers. </p><p> </p><p>8.  USAID, in collaboration with the GOJ, will provide </p><p>vocational training to 1000 Jordanians in Irbid via the </p><p>Jordan U.S. Business Partnership Program.  The plan is to </p><p>have highly skilled Sri Lankan garmenteers give intensive </p><p>training to Jordanians in groups of 15-20 at a time over the </p><p>course of a year.  The cost of this program will not exceed </p><p>USD 300,000, based on a one year estimate.  The goal is to </p><p>increase the supply of trained Jordanian garmenteers to help </p><p>meet QIZ demand.  Depending on the effectiveness of this </p><p>initiative, USAID may continue with vocational training </p><p>endeavors. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>CULTURAL FACTORS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. Aside from the lack of trained workers, Jordanian cultural </p><p>norms also hamper productivity.  Even Omrani concedes that </p><p>Jordanian workers, "will not work as hard as the Chinese". </p><p>Additionally, Jordanians, and in particular women, have heavy </p><p>familial responsibilities.  Nearly all Jordanian female </p><p>textile laborers leave employment after marriage; this </p><p>curtails the average working career for such laborers to less </p><p>than four years, according to Karka.  In the face of </p><p>experienced labor imported from countries such as China on </p><p>two year contracts, Jordanians are generally less productive. </p><p> Omrani commented that on top of everything else, many QIZ </p><p>companies do not enforce maximum workday laws on imported </p><p>labor, and the GOJ is, according to him, averse to </p><p>challenging such companies, whose investors may already be </p><p>tepid toward further investment in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Plant manager Karka was optimistic about shifting </p><p>Jordanian cultural views toward female labor.  There is a </p><p>growing number (currently about 10% of Century\'s workforce) </p><p>of married female laborers, and Karka was proud to report </p><p>that the women at his factory were happy and enjoyed </p><p>workplace camaraderie.  The jobs give them their own income, </p><p>their own identity, and their own sense of worth, he said. </p><p>The prediction that Jordanian women would not or could not </p><p>produce quality textile goods has been proven false, Karka </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  In light of satisfactory labor conditions, greatly </p><p>increasing production, and growing acceptance by Jordanian </p><p>society, the QIZs will benefit most from efforts to augment </p><p>vocational training.  As reported in reftel, the biggest </p><p>sticking point in continued development of the QIZs is a lack </p><p>of trained Jordanian labor.  Given the current political </p><p>climate and the recent economic slump, the fact that </p><p>thousands of traditionally clad Jordanian women, working in </p><p>western-style factories (built partially through Israeli </p><p>capital investment), producing goods for export to the US is </p><p>a major success story. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
