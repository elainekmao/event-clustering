SUMMARY. ITALY\'S ALREADY WEAK ECONOMY WILL REGISTER AN </p><p>ANEMIC GDP GROWTH RATE OF ONE PERCENT IN 2002, WITH A </p><p>MODERATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY EXPECTED ONLY IN THE SECOND HALF </p><p>OF THE YEAR.  IN 2003, GDP GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO CLIMB </p><p>ABOVE TWO PERCENT. INVESTMENT WILL PROMPT THE VERY MODEST </p><p>GROWTH IN 2002, WHILE THE 2003 GROWTH WILL BE SUPPORTED BY </p><p>EXPORTS AND A GRADUAL ACCELERATION IN GROWTH OF HOUSEHOLD </p><p>CONSUMPTION, AS WELL AS AN IMPROVED GLOBAL ECONOMIC </p><p>PICTURE. INFLATION IS EXPECTED TO SLOW OVER THE FORECAST </p><p>PERIOD, ALTHOUGH THE EURO CHANGEOVER AND AN UNUSUALLY COLD </p><p>WINTER WILL PUSH INFLATION SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN THE FIRST </p><p>QUARTER OF THIS YEAR. ONE-TIME MEASURES PROPOSED TO REDUCE </p><p>THE DEFICIT WILL FALL SHORT OF THE GOIS OPTIMISTIC </p><p>PREDICTIONS. CRITICAL STRUCTURAL REFORMS WILL NOT TAKE </p><p>PLACE IN 2002, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR THE GOI TO MEET </p><p>BUDGET DEFICIT TARGETS FOR 2002. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00462  01 OF 08  302302Z </p><p>GDP GROWTH </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN THE AFTERMATH OF SEPTEMBER 11 AND THE GLOBAL </p><p>ECONOMYS TAILSPIN, ITALY, LIKE THE REST OF THE EU, SAW ITS </p><p>ECONOMY STUMBLE BADLY. FOURTH QUARTER 2001 RESULTS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH STILL TRICKLING IN, ARE SHOWING ZERO PERCENT OR </p><p>EVEN A NEGATIVE GDP GROWTH RATE. THESE RESULTS MORE THAN </p><p>OFFSET THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRST QUARTER, WHEN </p><p>GDP ROSE AT AN ANNUALIZED RATE OF MORE THAN 3 PERCENT. WE </p><p>EXPECT THAT FINAL FIGURES WILL SHOW A GROWTH RATE OF 1.8 </p><p>PERCENT. AVERAGE EURO-ZONE GROWTH IN 2001 IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN 1.5 PERCENT.  FOR ITALY, THIS IS A SILVER LINING </p><p>IN AN OTHERWISE BLEAK PICTURE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  FOR MOST OF THE 1990S AND INCLUDING 2000, ITALY HAS HAD </p><p>A SLOWER GROWTH RATE THAN THE AVERAGE OF EURO-ZONE </p><p>ECONOMIES. THE GOI STILL OFFICIALLY FORECASTS THAT GDP </p><p>GROWTH IN 2001 WILL RANGE FROM 1.9 PERCENT TO TWO PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE ACROSS-THE-BOARD WEAK FOURTH QUARTER PERFORMANCE, </p><p>FROM INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION TO HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION, WILL </p><p>REVERBERATE FOR MONTHS.  GDP GROWTH FOR 2002 IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>BE AN ANEMIC ONE PERCENT, ACCORDING TO THE CONSENSUS </p><p>FORECAST OF ITALIAN RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS.  THE OECD IN ITS </p><p>ANNUAL REPORT PREDICTS A GDP GROWTH RATE OF 1.2 PERCENT. IN </p><p>CONTRAST, THE GOI PREDICTS 2.3 PERCENT GDP GROWTH. </p><p> </p><p>5. WE CONCUR WITH LEADING THINK-TANKS THAT THE GOIS </p><p>PREDICTION IS TOO OPTIMISTIC.  THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS NOT </p><p>EXPECTED TO BEGIN TO REBOUND UNTIL THE SECOND HALF OF THIS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00462  01 OF 08  302302Z </p><p>YEAR, WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO DEPRESS ITALIAN EXPORTS TO ITS </p><p>MAJOR MARKETS: THE U.S. AND GERMANY.  THE LATTERS MORE </p><p>PROFOUND ECONOMIC WOES ARE BAD NEWS FOR ITALIAN EXPORTERS, </p><p>SINCE GERMANY IS THEIR NUMBER ONE EXPORT MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>6. INVESTMENT WILL CONTINUE AT MODERATE RATES.  THE GOI </p><p>PREDICTS THAT THE TREMONTI LAW, WHICH PROVIDES TAX BENEFITS </p><p>FOR REINVESTED PROFITS, WILL SPUR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN </p><p>2002, WHICH, IN TURN, WILL PROP UP GDP GROWTH.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT, GIVEN GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES, ITALIAN </p><p>COMPANIES WILL MAKE MARKET MOVES CAUTIOUSLY AND POSTPONE </p><p>MAJOR INVESTMENTS. WE EXPECT THAT THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF </p><p>THE TREMONTI LAW WILL ONLY BEGIN TO BE FELT IN THE LATTER </p><p>HALF OF THE YEAR. THE GOI ALSO EXPECTS AN UPTURN IN </p><p>HOUSEHOLD CONFIDENCE AND CONSUMPTION.  AGAIN, THE CONSENSUS </p><p>IS THAT CONSUMERS ARE ADOPTING A WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE </p><p>UNTIL THERE ARE SIGNS OF A GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY. </p><p>ECONOMIC WOES IN REGIONS OUTSIDE OF EUROPE ALSO MAY HAVE A </p><p>BOOMERANG EFFECT.  SOME 200,000 INVESTORS IN ITALY HAVE </p><p>ASSETS, THROUGH MUTUAL FUNDS AND INDIVIDUAL STOCKS, IN </p><p>ARGENTINA. (ACCORDING TO THE LATEST ESTIMATES, ITALIANS </p><p>OVERALL EXPOSURE IN ARGENTINA IS ABOUT E12 BILLION.
