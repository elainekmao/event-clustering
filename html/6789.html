<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 GUATEMALA 000781 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PGOV, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: RE-CERTIFICATION BENCHMARKS DEMARCHE DELIVERED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 66351 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 770 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador John R. Hamilton.  Reason 1.5 (B&D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  As requested in Ref A, the Ambassador </p><p>discussed counter-narcotics re-certification benchmarks in </p><p>detail with President Portillo on March 22.  The Ambassador </p><p>gave Portillo a copy of the diplomatic note on benchmarks </p><p>(full text para 10), rebuffed a request for material </p><p>assistance to the Guatemalan military, and warned that the </p><p>use of torture against narco-traffickers is unacceptable to </p><p>the USG and would be extremely prejudicial to Guatemala\'s </p><p>chances for re-certification.  Portillo raised no objections </p><p>to the benchmarks and promised to investigate MINUGUA\'s </p><p>allegations of the use of torture and to stop any further use </p><p>of torture in the war against narcotics trafficking.  DCM met </p><p>separately with Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Perez and </p><p>Secretary for Strategic Analysis Arturo Montenegro to discuss </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the benchmarks.  Perez proposed a follow-up meeting on </p><p>benchmarks between GOG vice ministers and the DCM and NAS on </p><p>March 26.  We anticipate that the GOG will formally agree to </p><p>the benchmarks.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador\'s meeting with Portillo was reported </p><p>in Ref B.  MINUGUA chief Koenigs had told the Ambassador on </p><p>March 21 that there was strong evidence of the use of torture </p><p>and illegal detention (for at least eight hours) against </p><p>three narco-trafficking suspects on March 6, in Zacapa </p><p>province.  MINUGUA\'s conclusions in this case were based on a </p><p>joint investigation by its regional office in Zacapa in </p><p>conjunction with the Human Rights Ombudsman\'s representative. </p><p> To compile its report, MINUGUA interviewed the </p><p>suspects/victims, police and anti-narcotics (SAIA) police </p><p>sources.  We have been unable to corroborate MINUGUA\'s report </p><p>with official sources in the SAIA or the military, who deny </p><p>any involvement with torture in this case.  Nevertheless, </p><p>based on discussions with unofficial sources, MINUGUA\'s </p><p>allegations appear credible. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) DCM met with Perez and Montenegro on March 19, </p><p>accompanied by Acting NAS Chief and PolOff.  He provided </p><p>Spanish and English versions of the benchmarks received from </p><p>the Department, commenting that these benchmarks are not </p><p>substantially different from what had previously been under </p><p>discussion. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The two GOG officials made the following comments </p><p>in response to specific benchmarks: </p><p> </p><p>-- SAIA Institution Building:  Montenegro provided a copy of </p><p>a general order from the National Civil Police establishing </p><p>the Guatemalan Narcotics Police (SAIA) which outlined basic </p><p>selection requirements for entry into the unit.  Montenegro </p><p>asked if this order satisfied the benchmark requirements. </p><p>Acting NAS chief noted that the order was a partial document </p><p>of a larger regulation and that the requirement for periodic </p><p>urinalysis and polygraph testing would be contained in </p><p>another part of the regulation which was not presented. </p><p>Perez distinguished between "formal versus real" compliance, </p><p>noting that issuing an order may satisfy the formal </p><p>requirement, but real compliance would involve verification </p><p>of implementation.  Montenegro acknowledged this point, and </p><p>added that the order indicated the GOG\'s intention to comply. </p><p> </p><p>-- Extradition:  Perez asked what time frame is implied in </p><p>the phase "over the coming year."  DCM replied that it was </p><p>the next 12 months. </p><p> </p><p>-- Precursor Chemicals:  Montenegro confirmed that the </p><p>regulations have already been passed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Perez noted that the benchmarks now total nine vs. </p><p>the ten previously discussed, since the issues of seizures </p><p>and prosecutions have been combined in the current document. </p><p>Montenegro said the order of the benchmarks has apparently </p><p>changed.  Previously, the first benchmarks under discussion </p><p>were those under the direct responsibility of the Executive. </p><p>Now they are mixed.  Perez said that is not a problem;  the </p><p>benchmarks are a GOG, not solely Executive responsibility. </p><p>He said he has not discussed this yet with the Foreign </p><p>Minister, but he will propose that the GOG assign primary </p><p>responsibility for completion of each benchmark to the </p><p>responsible ministry, and name an individual responsible, </p><p>thereby creating a matrix of goals and accountable </p><p>institutions and individuals. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Perez said the Portillo Administration has "a </p><p>mountain" of demands on it in its last year, but wants to </p><p>make substantial progress meeting the benchmarks by </p><p>September, 2003.  Re-certification is important to the GOG\'s </p><p>bilateral relationship with the U.S., the GOG\'s financial </p><p>interests (Comment:  this is a reference to stalled efforts </p><p>to float Eurobonds.  End Comment.), and also a national </p><p>interest in combating narco-trafficking and related </p><p>corruption. </p><p>7.  (SBU) Perez acknowledged that the recertification effort </p><p>will require coordinated action by the Executive, the Public </p><p>Ministry and the judiciary.  Given shortage of prosecutors </p><p>and resources, progress will be difficult, and will require </p><p>shifting prosecutorial assets to this task in the next </p><p>semester.  DCM asked if the Public Ministry and judiciary are </p><p>willing to do so.  Perez said yes.  He said FM Gutierrez has </p><p>two priority areas for transition to the next government: </p><p>the Peace Accord Agenda and the Counter-narcotics Matrix.  He </p><p>asked if the USG would object to the GOG sharing the matrix </p><p>with other countries who might be able to provide support (he </p><p>mentioned Japan in the context of better port management, and </p><p>Spain to train police).  The DCM said we would have no </p><p>objection to the GOG doing this once we have a formal </p><p>agreement on benchmarks.  Perez proposed, and the DCM </p><p>accepted, a meeting between GOG vice ministers, the DCM and </p><p>NAS on March 26 to discuss the benchmarks further. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Secretary Montenegro concluded by saying the new </p><p>benchmarks offered "no surprises" and indicated general </p><p>agreement on the substantive issues.  Montenegro said that he </p><p>hopes to develop a national counter-narcotics strategy for </p><p>Cabinet approval, to coordinate GOG policy and create a </p><p>policy framework useful to this and the next government.  He </p><p>is aware of the Government of Mexico\'s strategy document, and </p><p>was told of the USG strategies.  He asked for NAS </p><p>collaboration in this effort, which we to. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) We anticipate no major roadblocks to formal </p><p>Guatemalan agreement to these benchmarks.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Text of Diplomatic Note on Benchmarks provided to </p><p>GOG: </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy of the United States of America presents its </p><p>compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Guatemala </p><p>and has the honor to refer to conversations between our two </p><p>governments on the matter of counter-narcotics cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>To comply with current United States law establishing the </p><p>certification mechanism and to respond to calls for a more </p><p>transparent process, the Embassy of the United States takes </p><p>advantage of this opportunity to advise the Government of </p><p>Guatemala of U.S. law governing the certification process and </p><p>both generic and specific certification standards. </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy wishes to establish at the outset that the </p><p>International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) and </p><p>other U.S. policy documents on drug control underscore U.S. </p><p>efforts to curb its own drug consumption problems.   Illegal </p><p>drugs exact an enormous toll on U.S. society: 52,000 lives </p><p>annually and some $160 billion dollars a year in economic </p><p>costs.  Sixteen million Americans use drugs on a current </p><p>basis, and 5.6 million meet the criteria for needing drug </p><p>treatment.  United States National Drug Control Policy </p><p>commits unprecedented resources to the treatment of drug </p><p>abuse and the reduction of demand: some $5.2 billion in </p><p>Fiscal Year 2002.  President Bush has announced the United </p><p>States goal of reducing drug use by 10 percent in two years </p><p>and 25 percent in five years.  Recent data from the </p><p>University of Michigan\'s "Monitoring the Future" survey show </p><p>the first significant downturn in youth drug use in nearly a </p><p>decade, with reduced drug use noted among 8th, 10th, and 12th </p><p>graders. </p><p> </p><p>No domestic policy of demand reductions can succeed, however, </p><p>while the supply of drugs into the United States continues </p><p>unrestrained.  For that reason, we also place enormous </p><p>importance on cooperation with other countries.  The United </p><p>States Government\'s aim in approaching the Government of </p><p>Guatemala now is to establish a dialogue regarding the United </p><p>States and Guatemala counter-narcotics objectives for the </p><p>near term and to present clear objectives that, if met, will </p><p>be given due consideration by the U.S. in evaluating </p><p>compliance with the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN </p><p>convention and the United States and Guatemala bilateral </p><p>counter-narcotics program.  The Embassy of the United States </p><p>is pleased with the exchanges held to date and will continue </p><p>to dialogue with the Government of Guatemala on this subject </p><p>throughout the year.  The United States Government is </p><p>prepared to review the original decision regarding </p><p>Guatemala\'s counter-narcotics cooperation in response to </p><p>significant progress in all areas of the shared </p><p>counter-narcotics agenda.  The benchmarks outlined in this </p><p>diplomatic note are not "all or nothing" mandates but, </p><p>rather, represent a series of concrete steps toward a </p><p>definite target.  Significant progress on taking these steps </p><p>would demonstrate the will of the Government of Guatemala to </p><p>meet its international counter-narcotics obligations. </p><p> </p><p>The United States Government\'s assessment of a country\'s </p><p>counter-narcotics performance is independent of levels of </p><p>U.S. bilateral counter-narcotics assistance to that country. </p><p>However, within budgetary limitations, the United States </p><p>Government will seek to be as responsive as possible to the </p><p>Government of Guatemala\'s requests for drug control </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p>Under U.S. law, each country identified by the President as a </p><p>major illicit drug producing or drug- transit country is </p><p>subject to the annual certification process.  Under this </p><p>process, the President determines, based upon overall </p><p>counter-narcotics performance, whether the country has </p><p>"failed demonstrably" during the previous 12 months to make </p><p>substantial efforts to adhere to their obligations under </p><p>international counter-narcotics agreements and take the </p><p>counter-narcotics measures specified in U.S. law.  The </p><p>certification decisions are made by the President upon the </p><p>recommendations of the Secretary of State, with input from </p><p>other concerned United States Government agencies. </p><p> </p><p>In order not to be found as having "failed demonstrably," a </p><p>country must take meaningful and committed actions against </p><p>narcotics trafficking and related criminal activity.  Key </p><p>criteria considered in the certification process include: </p><p> </p><p>(1) Performance in areas identified in the 1988 UN drug </p><p>convention: namely, cultivation/manufacturing; </p><p>consumption/demand reduction; trafficking; illicit crop </p><p>eradication/substitution; interdiction and law enforcement </p><p>cooperation; asset seizure; extradition and mutual legal </p><p>assistance; drug treatment; control of precursor/essential </p><p>chemicals; and money laundering. </p><p> </p><p>(2) Performance in accomplishing goals described in any </p><p>applicable bilateral narcotics agreement with the United </p><p>States, or a multilateral narcotics agreement; </p><p> </p><p>(3) Performance in preventing and punishing public </p><p>corruption, especially by senior government officials that </p><p>facilitates the production, processing, or shipment of drugs </p><p>and other controlled substances, or that discourages the </p><p>investigation or prosecution of such acts; and </p><p> </p><p>(4) The United States Government is very interested in </p><p>efforts to improve regional cooperation and regional </p><p>activities to support the goals of the 1988 UN drug </p><p>convention. The Government of the United States will consider </p><p>such activities and initiatives as we evaluate performance. </p><p> </p><p>While the President makes his certification determinations </p><p>based on a country\'s compliance with all aspects of the 1988 </p><p>UN drug convention, bilateral agreements, other multilateral </p><p>agreements, and the elimination of corruption, there are </p><p>specific areas of interest that we will highlight during the </p><p>certification process.  The United States believes the </p><p>following actions could be taken: </p><p> </p><p>1.   SAIA Institutional Building: Adopt formal regulations to </p><p>govern SAIA activities and operations based on the </p><p>regulations and policies used by the National Civilian </p><p>Police. Policies should include regular polygraphs and </p><p>urinalysis, as well as mechanisms to promote greater </p><p>cooperation between the SAIA and the Anti-Narcotics </p><p>Prosecutors. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Significant Increase in Seizures, Arrests and </p><p>Prosecutions: Increased development and prosecution of cases </p><p>against those involved in narco-trafficking and other types </p><p>of organized crime.  Guatemala should increase security </p><p>measures to protect judges and prosecutors.  Cocaine seizures </p><p>should return to CY2000 levels, which averaged 800 kilos or </p><p>more per month, with a significant seizure at ports of entry </p><p>at least every two months. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Inventory and Destroy All Drugs Seized before 1999 and </p><p>Increase Warehouse Security: Destroy all seized drugs not </p><p>needed for evidence by April 30th, and develop and implement </p><p>security measures for drug warehouses. Establish clear </p><p>procedures for chain of custody, evidence handling, and drug </p><p>destruction. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Sign the Counter-narcotics Bilateral Maritime Agreement </p><p>with the U.S.: Guatemala should negotiate and sign a </p><p>counter-narcotics bilateral maritime agreement with the USG. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Search Warrants: Guatemala should develop a mechanism </p><p>that ensures that narcotics search warrants are issued in a </p><p>timely and secure fashion. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Successful Completion of Extradition Requests: Guatemala </p><p>should fully process all pending U.S. extradition requests. </p><p>Over the coming year, the Government of Guatemala  should </p><p>cooperate in identifying procedures to expedite extradition </p><p>requests. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Successful Promulgation and Implementation of </p><p>Regulations on Precursor Chemicals: Guatemala should </p><p>promulgate the implementing regulations that are required by </p><p>the precursor chemical law of 1999. </p><p> </p><p>8.   Seized Assets and Forfeited/Undeclared Cash: Guatemala </p><p>should adopt and implement legislative and/or procedural </p><p>reforms for seizing and utilizing in an efficient manner all </p><p>assets of criminals acquired through criminal activity, and </p><p>assign these assets to strengthen the Judiciary, the Public </p><p>Ministry, and the Police, who are battling narco-trafficking </p><p>and organized crime. Special emphasis should be placed on </p><p>transferring seized cash into law-enforcement programs. </p><p> </p><p>9.   Money Laundering Efforts: Guatemala\'s money laundering </p><p>legislation is the best weapon in the fight against </p><p>corruption and organized crime. Guatemala should assign </p><p>sufficient personnel who are qualified to the Money </p><p>Laundering Prosecutor\'s Office and will make every effort to </p><p>take cases to trial. The Financial Investigations Unit </p><p>(IVE), that is part of the Superintendent of Banks (SIB), </p><p>should share information with the Prosecutor\'s office in </p><p>conformance with the Guatemalan money laundering law. These </p><p>efforts will contribute to Guatemala coming off the Financial </p><p>Action Task Force (FATF) list of non-cooperating countries in </p><p>anti-money laundering efforts.  Guatemala should take all </p><p>necessary steps to improve inter-institutional cooperation </p><p>that will allow for more effective compliance with the money </p><p>laundering law. </p><p> </p><p>The efforts of U.S. and Guatemalan governments can do much to </p><p>reduce the threat of drug addiction to the youth of the two </p><p>countries.  The Government of the United States looks forward </p><p>to continued discussions with the Government of Guatemala on </p><p>strengthening counter-narcotics cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy of the United States of America takes the </p><p>opportunity to renew to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of </p><p>the Government of Guatemala the assurances of its highest </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p>Embassy of the United States of America, Guatemala City, </p><p>March 21, 2003. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
