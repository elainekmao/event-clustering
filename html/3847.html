KATHMANDU 1443 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael Malinowski for reason 1.5 (b)(d) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) There have been increasing restrictions on the </p><p>Tibetan refugee community in Nepal.  Celebrations and </p><p>cultural events have been canceled on short notice by </p><p>government authorities, press conferences interrupted by </p><p>police and the Office of Tibet Representative detained for </p><p>a day.  Although many Tibetan refugees are still able to </p><p>enter Nepal and transit to India, post has received </p><p>credible reports of an apparent increase in refugees being </p><p>turned back at the border by Nepali immigration </p><p>authorities.  The Government of Nepal (GON) has repeatedly </p><p>declared that they will have no tolerance for \'anti-China\' </p><p>activities, and Prime Minister Deuba has confirmed that </p><p>Chinese pressure is behind the shift in policy toward </p><p>Tibetans.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>"POLITICAL" EVENTS CANCELED; </p><p>MONASTERIES LEFT ALONE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Kathmandu ref cables report incidents in which </p><p>Tibetan gatherings have been halted by police or canceled </p><p>by Nepali authorities with short notice to the </p><p>coordinators.  Office of Tibet Representative Wangchuk </p><p>Tsering has directly attributed the incidents to Beijing, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>stating in a letter to the Embassy that the Tibetan </p><p>community has been "prevented by the concerned authorities </p><p>of Nepal from organizing any cultural or social gatherings </p><p>on numerous occasions because of China\'s interference." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Tsering\'s assertions are supported by the common </p><p>theme of the canceled events: a link with the Dalai Lama or </p><p>the Tibetan government-in-exile.  In April, a cultural </p><p>program sponsored by the Tibetan Youth Association to </p><p>celebrate the thirteenth birthday of the Dalai </p><p>Lama-recognized Panchen Lama was called off by police.  In </p><p>July, three separate events planned for the weekend of the </p><p>Dalai Lama\'s birthday had to be canceled on short notice </p><p>when the GON issued an official order to the Radisson Hotel </p><p>not to accept any business from any Tibetan refugee groups </p><p>for the duration of the celebration (ref B).  Earlier this </p><p>month, a Tibetan Democracy Day religious gathering was </p><p>interrupted by police, and Tsering himself was detained in </p><p>police custody for most of the day (ref C). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Conversely, purely religious events such as </p><p>liturgical dances are allowed to continue with no </p><p>interference from the GON as long as they are confined to a </p><p>private location.  Tibetan Democracy Day religious </p><p>ceremonies were allowed to continue, once they were moved </p><p>inside.  "The monasteries are left alone," confirmed </p><p>Matthieu Ricard (protect), a French citizen and Buddhist </p><p>monk well-connected to the Tibetan community, "but when the </p><p>(Office of Tibet) Representative lifts his little finger, </p><p>if the government knows about it, they stop it." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Tsering has characterized GON interference with the </p><p>Tibetans\' freedom of assembly, which he says has been on </p><p>the rise for the past two years, as increasingly frequent, </p><p>persistent, indiscriminate and immediate; and he has </p><p>related statements from government and police officials </p><p>fingering China as the motivating force behind the </p><p>crackdown.  His sources "say that the Chinese Embassy tells </p><p>them something, and it gets done," Tsering told PolOff in a </p><p>September 25 interview. "We have a religious activity or a </p><p>cultural event, but the Chinese Embassy tells the MFA it is </p><p>an \'anti-China\' activity, and the MFA informs the </p><p>authorities that it must be stopped without looking into </p><p>the background." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>PM, GON OFFICIALS CONFIRM CHINESE PRESSURE; </p><p>KING REITERATES NO TOLERANCE FOR \'ANTI-CHINA\' ACTIVITIES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The fingers pointing north are not simply a reflex </p><p>response.  Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba confirmed to </p><p>Ambassador Malinowski earlier this month that the GON is </p><p>under pressure from China about the Tibetans.  Both UNHCR </p><p>and the Office of Tibet indicate that GON officials of </p><p>various ranks and positions have told them directly that </p><p>Chinese pressure is behind the shift in treatment of </p><p>Nepal\'s Tibetan community. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) King Gyanendra clearly stated Nepal\'s stand on his </p><p>state visit to Beijing in July.  "(Nepal) will not allow </p><p>the emergence of elements running against the development </p><p>of Nepal-Chinese ties," he was quoted as saying in the </p><p>local press. "It will not permit within its borders any </p><p>activities that undermine China\'s interests."  Newly </p><p>appointed Chief of Army Staff Pyar Jung Thapa reiterated </p><p>the statement this month.  The crux of the problem, </p><p>according to most Embassy sources in the Tibetan community, </p><p>is that the GON is applying too sweeping a definition to </p><p>"anti-China" activities, probably at the behest of Chinese </p><p>officials and possibly in an effort to support the </p><p>"one-China" policy. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) In July, for example, police closed down a press </p><p>conference organized by a Nepali Buddhist organization to </p><p>refute a widely publicized statement by the Dorje Shugden </p><p>Society that the Dalai Lama was a terrorist and that </p><p>Tibetan monasteries in Nepal were used for "anti-China" </p><p>activities (ref D).  Police interrupted Tsering as he read </p><p>a prepared statement contradicting the claims, arresting </p><p>two organizers and halting the conference.  Newspaper </p><p>reports stated that police had acted on a warrant issued by </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and two high-ranking GON </p><p>spokesmen attributed the incident to support for the </p><p>"one-China" policy. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>CHANGES AT THE BORDER </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Additional problems exist at the China-Nepal </p><p>border.  Refugees arriving at the Tibetan Reception Center </p><p>(TRC) have reported increased Chinese security at the </p><p>border, including undercover immigration officers dressed </p><p>in village clothing as well as armed patrols.  Many state </p><p>that they were stopped by the Chinese on their first or </p><p>second attempt to cross into Nepal and either imprisoned </p><p>for a short term or sent to forced labor for up to two </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) In addition to increased Chinese security, the </p><p>Embassy received reports earlier this year that Nepali </p><p>border guards were handing Tibetans back to the Chinese, </p><p>despite a "gentleman\'s agreement" with UNHCR that would </p><p>allow them to freely transit to India.  According to Roland </p><p>Weil (protect), UNHCR Protection Officer, sporadic reports </p><p>have come from refugees arriving at the TRC who claim to </p><p>have been turned around by Nepali immigration officials on </p><p>their first try.  Initial news came from sympathetic police </p><p>at border posts who phoned UNHCR offices to report that </p><p>they had "had to" turn Tibetans over to Chinese </p><p>authorities. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Weil does not believe the GON has issued a </p><p>comprehensive order to turn people back, since police still </p><p>occasionally escort groups of refugees to the TRC, and he </p><p>added that no new reports of forced repatriation have been </p><p>received since early this year. "That doesn\'t mean it </p><p>doesn\'t happen, however," he cautioned, stating that </p><p>information flow from the border has been hampered by the </p><p>destruction of communication infrastructure. "Police can\'t </p><p>call us even if they would want to, and we can\'t call them </p><p>to ask what has been happening." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>PROPAGANDA IN THE PRESS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) In early September, a series of editorials by the </p><p>usually well-respected Kathmandu Post editor-in-chief </p><p>Yubaraj Ghimire were published following a trip to Tibet </p><p>for Nepali journalists sponsored by the Chinese government. </p><p>From the opening line, the intent of the articles was </p><p>clear. "China values Nepal\'s unequivocal support on the </p><p>one-China policy," the first article began, before </p><p>launching into a catalogue of possible benefits of </p><p>cooperation, ranging from increased cross-border tourism to </p><p>Chinese investment in Nepali industry and even the </p><p>possibility of linking Nepal into railway service to </p><p>Shanghai.  Further articles stated that "even if the Dalai </p><p>Lama decides against getting back to Tibet... the Chinese </p><p>government seems determined to protect (his position as </p><p>religious leader) in deference of the religious faith and </p><p>wishes of the Tibetans."  But despite the parroted prose, </p><p>the series captured the current situation in microcosm: </p><p>struggling Nepal can benefit from a cordial relationship </p><p>with China, and China\'s cordiality apparently has a price. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) In general, agreements between the GON and UNHCR </p><p>are still functioning as intended, and the GON\'s </p><p>relationship with the Tibetan community is tolerant on a </p><p>day-to-day basis. However, Chinese pressure is changing the </p><p>nature of that relationship.  Though it is unclear whether </p><p>the pressure is coming from the Chinese Embassy in </p><p>Kathmandu or from the central government in Beijing, the </p><p>effect is the same: freedom of expression and freedom of </p><p>assembly have been compromised and a long-standing </p><p>agreement with UNHCR appears to have been unilaterally </p><p>altered by the GON.  The Embassy has raised this issue at </p><p>the highest levels of the government, including with the </p><p>Prime Minister, and will continue to stress the value that </p><p>the USG places on individual rights. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
