The Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) initiative has had </p><p>a net positive, and increasingly widely-felt, effect on </p><p>Jordan\'s economy, political dynamics, and social structure. </p><p>While the success of the initiative to date is irrefutable, </p><p>the QIZ\'s will have to face a number of hurdles in the near </p><p>future.  These include continuing regional instability, the </p><p>rise of competing tariff preference programs in other parts </p><p>of the world, and the wholesale reconfiguration of the </p><p>global textile market in 2005 with the advent of the WTO\'s </p><p>multifiber arrangement (MFA).  The QIZ\'s are well-equipped </p><p>to meet these challenges and, in combination with Jordan\'s </p><p>Free Trade Agreement with the U.S., will maintain a place </p><p>for Jordan in the global textile production market. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT THE INITIATIVE IS </p><p> </p><p>2.  The QIZ initiative was created by Presidential </p><p>proclamation in November 1998.  It extended benefits of the </p><p>U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement to certain industrial zones </p><p>in Jordan identified and agreed upon by the U.S., Israeli, </p><p>and Jordanian governments.  Goods produced in such zones </p><p>were given duty-free access to the U.S., provided a certain </p><p>percentage of the value added of the good came from the QIZ, </p><p>Israel, and/or the West Bank/Gaza, in the following </p><p>proportions:  11.7% QIZ origin; 11.7% Israeli origin; 11.6% </p><p>QIZ/Israeli/WB/Gaza origin.  The balance of the value of the </p><p>good could be from anywhere in the world.  In February 1999, </p><p>the Israeli and Jordanian governments amended these </p><p>percentages on a temporary basis, reducing the required </p><p>Israeli input to 7% for high-tech goods and 8% for all other </p><p>goods for five years.  (Note:  The QIZ concept has been on </p><p>offer to Egypt as well since 1998, but Egypt has not yet </p><p>requested QIZ designation for any industrial parks.  End </p><p>note.)  The initiative was designed to provide an incentive </p><p>for Jordanian and Israeli businesses to develop partnerships </p><p>or even joint ventures in QIZ parks, thus creating a </p><p>constituency in favor of normalization within both </p><p>countries\' business communities. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC IMPACT </p><p> </p><p>3.  The QIZ\'s have enjoyed enormous economic success, due in </p><p>large part to the initiative\'s unforeseen attractiveness to </p><p>foreign textile producers who came to the QIZ\'s both to </p><p>escape quota ceilings in their own countries and to take </p><p>advantage of tariff breaks of 30% or more on a wide range of </p><p>apparel products.  The speed and effectiveness with which </p><p>the QIZ\'s have sparked export-led growth in Jordan is </p><p>impressive:  in 1999, total Jordanian exports to the U.S. </p><p>were barely $13 million.  In 2002, QIZ exports to the U.S. </p><p>are estimated to reach $400 million.  Because of the QIZ\'s, </p><p>the U.S. is now Jordan\'s largest export market, and Israel </p><p>(Jordan\'s other market for QIZ goods) is Jordan\'s fifth </p><p>largest export market.  The initiative has created over </p><p>21,000 new jobs directly, and an unknown level of indirect </p><p>employment.  The QIZ\'s have also attracted over $200 million </p><p>in new investment from some 11 countries, including Jordan, </p><p>Israel, the U.S., the UAE, India, Pakistan, and China/Hong </p><p>Kong/Taiwan.  While the bulk of QIZ investment initially </p><p>came from East Asia, there are now as many Jordanian QIZ </p><p>exporters as there are from any other investing country. </p><p> </p><p>4.  These national-level figures come into even sharper </p><p>focus at a regional level.  QIZ parks are routinely becoming </p><p>engines of growth in their communities.  The QIZ in Irbid, </p><p>Jordan\'s third-largest city, draws laborers from a half- </p><p>dozen nearby communities, and QIZ exports from the Al Hassan </p><p>Industrial Estate account for 80% of the park\'s exports. </p><p>Previously, Al Hassan was primarily home to small industrial </p><p>and engineering concerns linked to the Iraqi market.  In </p><p>Zarqa, Jordan\'s biggest industrial governorate, the impact </p><p>is even more noticeable.  The private sector-run QIZ park in </p><p>nearby Al Dulayl, despite a slow start, is now the clear </p><p>production leader for the region.  Al Dulayl\'s exports </p><p>account for 50% of all exports from the governorate.  Even </p><p>regions without functioning QIZ parks benefit from the </p><p>program.  The port of Aqaba receives most of the imports of </p><p>inputs for QIZ goods, and fully 40% of QIZ exports use Aqaba </p><p>as well.  This translates into jobs for truckers and port </p><p>workers, jobs which had been scarce in the years following </p><p>imposition of sanctions on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5.  At the local level, the QIZ initiative is having perhaps </p><p>its strongest, yet least-publicized, impact.  In Irbid, QIZ </p><p>exporters put $2 million in wages into the local economy </p><p>each month.  The multiplier effect of these wages is felt in </p><p>the retail sector, the transportation sector, and the food </p><p>and personal services sectors in the city and beyond, to </p><p>name just a few.  While no systematic study of these </p><p>ancillary benefits has been undertaken, the anecdotal </p><p>evidence of increased income growth can be seen on the </p><p>streets in new goods in shops, new business and residential </p><p>construction, and the like. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The QIZ experience has also had proven structural </p><p>benefits.  It is creating a trained industrial labor force </p><p>on a large scale for the first time ever.  It has also given </p><p>government and private-sector actors a crash-course in </p><p>investment promotion.  The improvement in Jordan\'s ability </p><p>to sell itself to foreign investors, particularly in the </p><p>private sector, has been marked in the past three years. </p><p>The private sector-run Al Tajammouat QIZ outside Amman is </p><p>the best example.  A relative late-comer to the QIZ game, </p><p>Tajammouat\'s management has aggressively marketed the park </p><p>in East and South Asia.  As a result, Tajammouat is now home </p><p>to more QIZ exporters than any other QIZ park (including the </p><p>original park in Irbid).  In fact, Tajammouat\'s investment </p><p>promotion officers have helped train the usually </p><p>lackadaisical Jordan Investment Board in promoting the </p><p>QIZ\'s.  Finally, the initiative is providing technology </p><p>transfer, helping to create in Jordan a cadre of business </p><p>managers, accountants, line supervisors, and workers who </p><p>understand global standards for quality, timeliness of </p><p>delivery, and dependability.  Such tech transfer is also </p><p>visible in the creation of these new, modern industrial </p><p>parks themselves, which will help Jordan to attract non-QIZ </p><p>businesses in the future to take advantage of the FTA. </p><p> </p><p>THE POLITICAL IMPACT </p><p> </p><p>7.  The political impact of the QIZ\'s has been more </p><p>measured, but notable nevertheless.  At a macro level, the </p><p>QIZ\'s have helped to moderate somewhat debate over </p><p>normalization.  As early as 2000, it was not uncommon to see </p><p>editorials sharply criticizing QIZ\'s because of the Israeli </p><p>content requirement, calls for the discontinuation of the </p><p>program, blackballing of businesses investing in QIZ\'s, and </p><p>the like.  With the success of the initiative, notably the </p><p>jobs it has created, that criticism has all but disappeared </p><p>from the English-language press, and is far more muted in </p><p>even the more vitriolic Arabic papers.  It is becoming </p><p>increasingly difficult for the Muslim Brotherhood, for </p><p>example, to call for the destruction of an initiative that </p><p>is providing good incomes for thousands of families, many of </p><p>them in traditionally poor, conservative communities.  Even </p><p>at the lowest points of the Intifada, when Jordanian </p><p>opposition groups were calling for breaking of diplomatic </p><p>relations with Tel Aviv, the QIZ\'s were given barely a </p><p>mention.  While there is still underlying discomfort with </p><p>QIZ\'s among many conservative Jordanians, and while many </p><p>Jordanian businessmen still shy away from QIZ investment </p><p>(either in opposition to Israeli participation or fear of </p><p>being blackballed for dealing with Israel), the public </p><p>debate over the relative merits of the QIZ\'s seems to have </p><p>been won by moderate elements. </p><p> </p><p> THE SOCIAL IMPACT </p><p> </p><p>8.  This is perhaps the most interesting, unforeseen, impact </p><p>of the QIZ\'s.  Some 70% of QIZ workers are women, and a </p><p>significant percentage of those are new entrants into the </p><p>workforce.  In addition, many of these women come from </p><p>small, traditional villages.  Scores of women interviewed by </p><p>the embassy reported an improved sense of self-worth, a </p><p>greater feeling of independence, and a greater degree of </p><p>overall satisfaction compared to their previous work in the </p><p>home.  This increased sense of empowerment has found form </p><p>in, among other things, women\'s discussion groups formed at </p><p>some factories in at least one QIZ park, where women say </p><p>they can talk about social and political issues that would </p><p>be frowned upon back in the village.  Limited interviews </p><p>with families have shown that, in many cases, a number of </p><p>women in the same family often take jobs in QIZ\'s , thereby </p><p>greatly increasing family income - especially in families </p><p>where the males have been jobless for some time.  The base </p><p>rate for a QIZ worker is Jordan\'s minimum wage of about </p><p>$112/month, but in reality labor competition has driven </p><p>those rates up to as much as $200-$250/month.  These changes </p><p>have of course created some stresses, notably in families </p><p>where women out-earn men, and in conservative family units </p><p>where the patriarch may force women in the family to quit </p><p>jobs or control their income through the use of direct- </p><p>deposit into patriarch-controlled bank accounts.  In </p><p>addition, many young women who take QIZ jobs leave the </p><p>workforce upon marriage, creating a turnover and training </p><p>problem.  These attitudes, though, are beginning to shift. </p><p> </p><p>ISSUES AHEAD </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Jordanian government will have to face a number of </p><p>procedural and structural issues to maintain the health of </p><p>the QIZ\'s in the coming years.  Most immediately, they will </p><p>need to renegotiate input percentages with the Israeli </p><p>government.  The 8% input level reverts to 11% in February </p><p>2004, and current investors are already howling about the </p><p>negative impacts of returning to the higher levels.  Jordan </p><p>has an interest in, de minimus, maintaining the 8% level, or </p><p>in restructuring the percentages to allow for more flexible </p><p>application of the Israeli input rule - both to keep current </p><p>investors and attract new ones.  To their credit, the </p><p>Jordanian government has for the first time framed this </p><p>issue in terms of benefit to Israel of restructuring the </p><p>regime, arguing that doing so will substantially increase </p><p>investment and broaden production into new product lines, </p><p>which would mean more business for Israeli firms as volumes </p><p>increase. </p><p> </p><p>10.  More generally, Jordan must cope with the rise of </p><p>competing tariff preference programs in other parts of the </p><p>world.  The Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Africa Growth </p><p>and Opportunities Act are both fighting to attract the same </p><p>pool of new investors from South and East Asia.  Jordan will </p><p>need to do an even better job selling itself, and will need </p><p>to further improve the functionality of the QIZ paperwork </p><p>process, to ensure they can continue to attract those </p><p>investors.  So far, Jordan has been fairly successful at </p><p>trumping these two competitors.  Another concern for Jordan </p><p>is the possibility of a Turkish-Israeli QIZ.  Domestic U.S. </p><p>textile concerns make it unlikely that any such QIZ would </p><p>include the textile sector, but a Turkish QIZ could steal </p><p>potential higher-end manufacturers away from Jordan down the </p><p>road - investors Jordan has not been successful in </p><p>attracting so far. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Politically, the QIZ\'s will continue to be affected by </p><p>instability in the region.  Instability in either Iraq or in </p><p>the West Bank/Israel has a negative affect on attracting new </p><p>investors.  This has been particularly true in the West </p><p>Bank, where spikes in Israeli/Palestinian violence have </p><p>correlated exactly with drop off\'s in new investor interest. </p><p>However, none of the turmoil to date has affected existing </p><p>investor interest.  None of the spikes in violence resulted </p><p>in lost production or sustained lost access to Israeli </p><p>inputs or the port of Haifa.  Partly as a result of the </p><p>ability of QIZ producers to thrive even during instability </p><p>in the West Bank, new investor interest has traditionally </p><p>returned to the QIZ\'s about three months after each spike in </p><p>violence.  In the long term, both Jordan and Israel have an </p><p>interest in making sure QIZ production is unaffected by </p><p>instability in the West Bank.  Thus we can expect both sides </p><p>to work hard to make sure access to inputs is maintained and </p><p>the northern border crossing to Haifa remains open. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Internally, Jordan\'s biggest challenge will be </p><p>continuing to be able to provide a trained industrial labor </p><p>force to a growing list of interested investors.  Industrial </p><p>labor training programs in Jordan are underfunded and poorly </p><p>targeted.  Most investors train their own employees, and </p><p>wage competition has started to be felt in the more </p><p>established QIZ\'s in Irbid, Zarqa and Amman as the most </p><p>highly trained workers can now command more than double the </p><p>normal wage.  While a labor squeeze is not yet a serious </p><p>problem, it may not be far off, and could slow investment </p><p>interest in the country.  The kingdom recently took initial </p><p>steps to improve and expand industrial labor training </p><p>through a joint Labor Ministry/Armed Forces training </p><p>program, but much more needs to be done.  On a related note, </p><p>the QIZ\'s continue to experience periodic isolated episodes </p><p>of labor complaints, usually surrounding payment of wages to </p><p>expatriate workers.  While these incidents remain few, they </p><p>are still an irritant that the GOJ will need to monitor and </p><p>take corrective action on as necessary to avoid any labor </p><p>stigma being attached to the QIZ\'s. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The biggest structural challenge for the QIZ\'s, though, </p><p>is the entry into force of the WTO multifiber arrangement in </p><p>2005.  On January 1 of that year, quotas on textile imports </p><p>into the U.S. will be eliminated, which will give low-cost, </p><p>high volume producers like China and Pakistan a massive </p><p>advantage in the textile sector.  Jordan\'s challenge will be </p><p>to maintain its current investors and try to attract new </p><p>ones in a far more competitive global textile market.  A </p><p>number of potential new investors interviewed by the Embassy </p><p>have indicated that, even in the post-2005 environment, they </p><p>would be interested in establishing facilities in Jordan. </p><p>Many of them believe that U.S. import quotas will be </p><p>replaced with increased duties, either under safeguards </p><p>measures or anti-dumping cases.  Should this be the case, </p><p>Jordan\'s tariff benefit under the QIZ\'s will be even more </p><p>pronounced.  In addition, many producers have a policy of </p><p>diversifying their sources of production to hedge against </p><p>instability in any one country.  Thus it appears Jordan, </p><p>with aggressive management by the government, will be able </p><p>to maintain a viable textile sector even after the </p><p>implementation of the multifiber arrangement in 2005. </p><p> </p><p>THE FTA AND THE QIZ\'S </p><p> </p><p>14.  The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement will, by 2010, </p><p>eliminate tariffs on all textile products.  Thus, eventually </p><p>the QIZ\'s will be anachronistic as the FTA matches tariff </p><p>breaks and provides for more straight-forward rules of </p><p>origin (i.e., no Israeli input requirements).  Such a </p><p>distinction will matter little for Jordan\'s economy or </p><p>ability to attract investment, as its tariff preferences </p><p>into the U.S. market relative to third countries will remain </p><p>the same.  However, if Israel hopes to continue to reap the </p><p>political and economic benefits of the QIZ\'s it will have to </p><p>scramble to keep Jordan-based textile producers interested </p><p>in the QIZ initiative.  Such an interest is not nearly so </p><p>pressing for Jordan, whose main benefit from the QIZ\'s has </p><p>been jobs, investment, and technology transfer -- all things </p><p>that will continue under the FTA. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>15.  The QIZ\'s are an important success story for Jordan and </p><p>for the ability of economic cooperation to foster political </p><p>cooperation.  They have also had a number of unintended - </p><p>and overwhelmingly positive - consequences, from industrial </p><p>labor force and investment promotion training to women\'s </p><p>empowerment.  Growth in new businesses has slowed from its </p><p>early heyday, due in part to continuing regional instability </p><p>and constraints on availability of trained labor.  In </p><p>addition, the uncertainty of the post-2005 global textile </p><p>environment is legitimate cause for pause in some Jordanian </p><p>circles.  Nevertheless, the QIZ initiative continues to draw </p><p>interested textile sector investors and to lay the </p><p>groundwork for attracting investors under the FTA. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
