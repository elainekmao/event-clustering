<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 001075 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SOCI, MOPS, PREL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: FLOOD OF SUPPORT FROM KUWAITI POPULATION </p><p> </p><p>1.  At 7:45am March 25, Op Center Kuwait received a call from </p><p>a Kuwaiti woman expressing support for our role in the </p><p>military action in Iraq.  She said her call was the result of </p><p>a text message she received on her cell phone telling her to </p><p>call the Embassy to let us know her opinion of the conflict </p><p>(pro or con).  The message also instructed her to forward it </p><p>to all of her friends.  The trickle of calls in the early </p><p>morning soon became a torrent, overwhelming the Embassy </p><p>switchboard, and all lines at the Op Center are now engaged </p><p>non-stop fielding phone calls from message recipients. </p><p>Between 9:30am and 4:30pm, the Embassy received 303 phone </p><p>calls supporting our actions in Iraq from people who received </p><p>the text message, and no/no phone calls opposed to the </p><p>conflict. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Post has no idea of the identity or motivation of the </p><p>person who began this message chain.  There is no doubt that </p><p>the phone calls are genuine expressions of support from </p><p>people who feel strongly enough about the issue to take the </p><p>time to call in.  Since the start of the war, even before </p><p>this call-in campaign, our contacts were typically starting </p><p>each phone call with expressions of support. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
