<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001010 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR TASK FORCE 1 - EB ACTION OFFICER </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR EB/ESC AND NEA/ARP </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/MAC/AME </p><p>DOE FOR IE - L. COBURN AND C. WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT OIL UPDATE -- MARCH 20, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 1002 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reasons 1.5. (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A full breakdown of KPC production was not available </p><p>today, but a senior KPC official reported total output was </p><p>2.45 million barrels for the period 0500 3/19/03 to 0500 </p><p>3/20/03. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Following several missile attacks aimed at Kuwait, a </p><p>senior KPC official contacted EconChief to ascertain the risk </p><p>such missile attacks posed to Kuwait\'s refineries.  After </p><p>consulting with OMC-K officials and the Ambassador, EconChief </p><p>told the KPC official that while the refineries are </p><p>potentially within the outer range of some Iraqi missiles, </p><p>the refineries are within the coverage of Patriot batteries </p><p>that are performing admirably to this point.  EconChief also </p><p>noted that Iraq appears to be targeting military targets, not </p><p>commercial or civilian targets.  The KPC official appreciated </p><p>the assessment. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) KPC officials report that "three Japanese customers and </p><p>one shipping company...are not prepared to enter the Gulf in </p><p>the present circumstances."  KPC expects that other firms may </p><p>follow suit, and that the move could affect loading </p><p>operations at other Northern Gulf ports such as Ras Tanura. </p><p>KPC officials intend to initiate "shuttle services" to move </p><p>crude and product to the Southern Gulf for transfer to </p><p>waiting tankers."  One KOTC Tanker captain refused to operate </p><p>in the Northern Gulf, he has been replaced.  KPC has the </p><p>capacity to move 100,000 to 200,000 bpd to Khor Fakkan, but </p><p>does not intend to "advertise" the fact that it is allowing </p><p>some customers to load there, for fear all will demand the </p><p>same service. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Dow Jones and Reuters news wires reported on 3/19 </p><p>comments by KPC officials that Kuwait is selling an </p><p>additional 300,000 to 350,000 barrels per day in an effort to </p><p>dampen high oil prices.  Most of the oil is being sold on </p><p>term contracts to Asian buyers, but the official said spot </p><p>sales may also occur "later on, if there is a need."  KPC </p><p>officials also said that KPC has no plans to stop any </p><p>operations, adding that operations would continue as normal </p><p>unless physical hostilities were directed against the </p><p>country\'s oil facilities.  The Reuters report added that </p><p>Kuwait has plans to use its own fleet to carry crude and </p><p>product to Khor Fakkan, near Fujairah, where Kuwait has </p><p>storage facilities. (Note: Khor Fakkan is located outside the </p><p>Persian Gulf, on the Gulf of Oman. End Note.) </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
