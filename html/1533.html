(U) CLASSIFIED BY ACTING DCM ROBERT DRY; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: THE CAPITALS OF THE TWO KEY CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS PROVINCES OF GIA LAI AND DAKLAK HAVE STABILIZED, </p><p>WITH NO MORE DEMONSTRATIONS SINCE THE WEEKEND OF FEB. 10- </p><p>11.  POLICE AND MILITARY PRESENCE REMAINS HEAVY IN THE </p><p>CAPITAL AND OUTLYING AREAS OF GIA LAI, WHICH WAS THE SITE </p><p>OF THE BIGGEST DEMONSTRATIONS.  BUON ME THUOT, CAPITAL OF </p><p>DAKLAK, IS CALM, AND THERE IS NO VISIBLE POLICE PRESENCE </p><p>THERE.  COFFEE TRADERS SAY THEIR WORK HAS RETURNED TO </p><p>NORMAL IN THE PROVINCES.  THE GVN REPORTEDLY SENT IN DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTERS DUNG AND TAC IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIRST </p><p>REPORTS OF DEMONSTRATIONS TWO WEEKS AGO TO MANAGE THE </p><p>SITUATION.  THE GVN CONTINUES TO SAY ONLY 20 VIETNAMESE </p><p>CITIZENS WERE ARRESTED FOLLOWING THE DEMONSTRATIONS, THOUGH </p><p>THEY DECLINE TO RELEASE ALL THE NAMES.  NGO SOURCES CLAIM </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WERE ARRESTED, THOUGH THIS CANNOT BE </p><p>VERIFIED.  AMBASSADOR IS RAISING OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>SITUATION AND REQUESTING ACCESS TO THE AREA WITH SENIOR GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>POLICE PRESENCE HEAVY IN GIA LAI; CALM IN DAKLAK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AS DOCUMENTED IN REF A AND INFORMAL COMMUNICATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00396  01 OF 02  161217Z </p><p>WITH EAP/BCLTV, CALM HAS RETURNED TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>PROVINCES OF GIA LAI AND DAKLAK FOLLOWING THE LARGE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE PREVIOUS WEEK.  (THE PROTESTS WERE </p><p>TRIGGERED BY THE ARREST JANUARY 29 OF TWO ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>MEN WHO APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN LEADERS IN PROTESTANT HOUSE </p><p>CHURCHES IN THE REGION.  THE TWO MEN WERE PROMPTLY RELEASED </p><p>AFTER SIGNING A STATEMENT BEFORE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES.) </p><p>WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS OF INJURIES SUFFERED BY </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS AND POLICE, BUT NO DEATHS HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONFIRMED.  THE MFA SPOKESPERSON FEB. 15 SAID THERE WERE 20 </p><p>PERSONS ARRESTED -- AND NO MORE -- IN GIA LAI PROVINCE, THE </p><p>SITE OF THE BIGGEST DEMONSTRATIONS.  SHE DECLINED TO GIVE </p><p>THEIR NAMES, HOWEVER.  NGO GROUPS, SUCH AS THE MONTAGNARD </p><p>FOUNDATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA, HAVE ALLEGED 200 OR MORE </p><p>PERSONS ARRESTED.  THE MFA CONTINUES TO DESCRIBE THOSE </p><p>ARRESTED AS "PROVOCATIVE PEOPLE" WHO DESTROYED PROPERTY AND </p><p>CAUSED INSTABILITY, BUT THE ROOTS OF THE PROTESTS ARE </p><p>VARIED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) EMBASSY AND CONSULATE STAFF CONTINUE TO MEET WITH </p><p>AND SPEAK BY PHONE WITH A WIDE RANGE OF DIPLOMATIC, NGO, </p><p>BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT SOURCES ABOUT THE EVENTS IN THE </p><p>HIGHLANDS.  AN ETHNIC MINORITY STUDENT FROM DAKLAK TOLD </p><p>CONGENOFF THAT ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF THE TENSIONS IS </p><p>THE CAMPAIGN BY SOME ETHNIC MINORITY PERSONS IN THE </p><p>PROVINCES FOR AUTONOMY FROM HANOI.  HE SAID RELIGION WAS </p><p>ONLY INCIDENTALLY A CAUSE OF THE UNREST; IT IS WHEN </p><p>"RELIGION CROSSES OVER INTO POLITICS" (AND PERSONS DEMAND </p><p>AUTONOMY) THAT IT BECOMES A POINT OF TENSION WITH THE GVN. </p><p>A VIETNAMESE BUSINESSMAN FROM PLEIKU, CAPITAL OF GIA LAI, </p><p>SAID THE GVN WAS TOTALLY TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00396  01 OF 02  161217Z </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS FOLLOWING THE ARREST OF THE TWO ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY PERSONS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE DANISH EMBASSY (PROTECT) HAS TWO RESIDENT </p><p>AID/DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL IN BUON ME THUOT, AND THEY REPORT </p><p>THE CITY IS QUIET.  IN A MEETING THIS WEEK WITH THE CHAIR </p><p>OF THE DAKLAK PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>"GOVERNOR", THE DANES WERE TOLD THE PROTESTERS THERE WERE </p><p>DEMANDING AUTONOMY AND WERE PROTESTING LACK OF EDUCATIONAL </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES.  (HE DID NOT MENTION LAND RIGHTS OR </p><p>RELIGIOUS ISSUES, THOUGH THESE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY PART OF THE </p><p>EQUATION, AS DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS REPORTING.) THE DANISH </p><p>EMBASSY TOLD US THEY WERE ABLE TO BOOK A FLIGHT INTO AND A </p><p>HOTEL IN BUON ME THUOT, SO IT APPEARS THE CITY HAS LARGELY </p><p>STABILIZED.  (GIA LAI IS MUCH MORE ISOLATED THAN DAKLAK, </p><p>WHICH IS THE MAJOR COFFEE-EXPORTING PROVINCE IN THE AREA. </p><p>GIA LAI IS MORE INSULAR, POORER AND HAS A SMALLER FOREIGN </p><p>NGO AND BUSINESS PRESENCE.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A GVN SOURCE TOLD A JAPANESE EMBOFF THAT DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG AND DEPUTY PM NGUYEN CONG </p><p>TAC WERE DISPATCHED TO THE REGION IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS BEGAN TO REPORT ON DEVELOPMENTS AND MANAGE </p><p>THE GVN\'S RESPONSE.  (COMMENT: IF TRUE, SUCH HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>ATTENTION SIGNALS THE GVN\'S PERCEPTION OF THE SERIOUSNESS </p><p>OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS AND THE DISCONTENT THEY REFLECT.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) COFFEE TRADERS INFORM FAS THAT NORMAL TRADING AND </p><p>MARKETING ACTIVITIES HAVE RESUMED IN THE TWO PROVINCES. </p><p>THEY SAY THE TWO CAPITAL CITIES ARE BOTH CALM.  DAKLAK IS </p><p>THE CENTER FOR ROUGHLY 60 PERCENT OF VIETNAM\'S EXPORT </p><p>COFFEE CULTIVATION.  GIA LAI (NORTH OF DAKLAK) AND LAM DONG </p><p>(SOUTH OF DAKLAK) ARE THE NEXT TWO BIGGEST CULTIVATORS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) THERE ARE NO AMERICAN CITIZENS REGISTERED WITH THE </p><p>EMBASSY OR CONSULATE WHO RESIDE IN EITHER DAKLAK OR GIA </p><p>LAI.  ACCORDING TO THE EXTERNAL RELATIONS OFFICE OF DAKLAK, </p><p>HOTELS IN THE PROVINCE ARE STILL CLOSED TO FOREIGNERS AS OF </p><p>FEB. 14, AND THEIR OFFICE ADVISES FOREIGNERS TO REFRAIN </p><p>FROM TRAVEL TO THE PROVINCE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.  (THIS </p><p>CONTRADICTS WHAT THE DANES HEARD, BUT IS THE MESSAGE </p><p>DELIVERED TO OUR MISSION.) </p><p> </p><p>ROOTS OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY REF A, WE CONTINUE TO </p><p>BELIEVE THE ROOTS OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS ORIGINATE IN </p><p>DISPUTES OVER LAND, HEAVY-HANDED TREATMENT OF PROTESTANT </p><p>RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS, AND ONGOING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES.  THE SPARK APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00396  02 OF 02  161217Z </p><p>HARASSMENT OF PROTESTANT HOUSE CHURCH LEADERS IN THE AREA, </p><p>THOUGH SMOLDERING RESENTMENT BY MINORITIES OVER THE LOSS OF </p><p>THEIR TRADITIONAL LANDS TO ETHNIC VIETNAMESE AND OTHER </p><p>MIGRANTS LIKELY WAS FUEL FOR THE FLAMES.  EXTREME </p><p>IMPOVERISHMENT OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, EXACERBATED BY THE </p><p>STEEP DROP IN COFFEE PRICES, ALSO WAS A CONTRIBUTING </p><p>FACTOR. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS OF HARASSMENT OF </p><p>PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL </p><p>MONTHS.  IN PARTICULAR, THE HOUSE CHURCHES (OR "VILLAGE </p><p>CHURCHES" IN OUTLYING RURAL AREAS) THAT ARE PREDOMINANT IN </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY AREAS COME IN FOR PARTICULAR HARASSMENT. </p><p>THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE THESE CHURCHES FACE A CATCH-22: </p><p>THEY ARE NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED AS LEGAL BODIES, AND </p><p>THUS MEMBERS COMING TOGETHER FOR PEACEFUL RELIGIOUS </p><p>ACTIVITIES ARE CONSIDERED OUTSIDE THE LAW AND SUBJECT TO </p><p>HARASSMENT OR ARREST DEPENDING ON THE WHIMS OF LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS.  ALSO, THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PETITION TO </p><p>BECOME LEGAL (AS WERE SOME 250 MORE-ESTABLISHED </p><p>"EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM" PROTESTANT CHURCHES THAT </p><p>WERE RECOGNIZED AS PART OF THE PROTESTANT CHURCH CONFERENCE </p><p>THAT CONCLUDED LAST WEEK IN HCMC).  RELIGIOUS HARASSMENT IS </p><p>ONE OF SEVERAL FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE TENSIONS IN THE </p><p>HIGHLANDS, BUT IT IS ONLY ONE OF SEVERAL.  LAND RIGHTS, </p><p>SOCIETAL DISCRIMINATION, EXTREME POVERTY AND DESPERATION, </p><p>AND THE CAMPAIGN BY SOME HIGHLANDS PEOPLES FOR AUTONOMY ARE </p><p>INEXTRICABLY LINKED; ALL OF THESE ARE ROOTS OF THE </p><p>TENSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00396  02 OF 02  161217Z </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE AFTERMATH OF THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS CLOSELY AND THE GVN\'S RESPONSE TO WHAT WERE </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY THE BIGGEST DEMONSTRATIONS AND EXPRESSION OF </p><p>POPULAR DISCONTENT SINCE THE THAI BINH UPRISING THREE YEARS </p><p>AGO.  THE AMBASSADOR HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE CONCERNS </p><p>REGARDING HUMAN RIGHTS WITH TRADE MINISTER VU KHOAN EARLIER </p><p>IN THE WEEK.  HE HAS AN APPOINTMENT TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>SITUATION IN DAKLAK AND GIA LAI AND OTHER ISSUES WITH VICE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER BIN EARLY NEXT WEEK.  WE RECOGNIZE THE </p><p>NEED TO GET A FIRSTHAND ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION IN THE </p><p>HIGHLANDS AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING TO DO SO.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
