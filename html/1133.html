<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L DAMASCUS 002985 </p><p> </p><p>NICOSIA FOR ILMG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 6/11/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, SY </p><p>SUBJECT: ASAD SITREP 03: BASHAR PROMOTED TO COMMANDER- </p><p>         IN-CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES; KHADDAM </p><p>         SIGNS DECREES BUT IS NOT ACTING PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RYAN C. CROCKER, REASON 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SYRIAN TELEVISION REPORTED THE AFTERNOON OF 6/11 </p><p>THAT VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM HAD SIGNED DECREE NUMBERS 9 </p><p>AND 10, PROMOTING COLONEL BASHAR AL-ASAD TO THE RANK OF </p><p>GENERAL AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE MOST OBVIOUS EFFECT OF THIS IS THAT BASHAR </p><p>HAS NOW OFFICIALLY ASSUMED ONE OF THE PRESIDENT\'S "THREE </p><p>HATS," I.E. HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES, HEAD OF THE PARTY, </p><p>AND HEAD OF STATE.  BASHAR IS EXPECTED TO BECOME HEAD OF </p><p>THE BA\'TH PARTY AT THE PARTY CONGRESS, STILL EXPECTED TO </p><p>TAKE PLACE JUNE 17-22, AND HEAD OF STATE AFTER A PUBLIC </p><p>REFERENDUM WHICH COULD BE HELD AS EARLY AS JUNE 25. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THIS DEVELOPMENT ALSO POINTS MORE CLEARLY TO HOW </p><p>WE BELIEVE THE DECISION-MAKING GROUP IS HANDLING THE </p><p>ISSUE OF "WHO\'S IN CHARGE."  NO INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN </p><p>APPOINTED ACTING PRESIDENT, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>STICKING AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE </p><p>AND THUS KHADDAM, AS FIRST VICE PRESIDENT, IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR SIGNING DECREES.  HOWEVER, WE NOTE THAT </p><p>KHADDAM IS NOT BEING REFERRED TO AS ACTING PRESIDENT, </p><p>NOR HAS HE MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS LIKELY DELIBERATE.  THE DECISION- </p><p>MAKING GROUP AT THIS POINT IS LIKELY COMPRISED OF </p><p>BASHAR, \'ASIF SHAWQAT, FM SHARA, DEFMIN TALAS, AND </p><p>PERHAPS OTHERS.  KHADDAM IS APPARENTLY COOPERATING AS </p><p>TITULAR SIGNER OF DECREES UNTIL BASHAR CAN TAKE OVER </p><p>OFFICIALLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CROCKER </p><p></p></div>
