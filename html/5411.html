<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000220 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT-OWNED PAPER TAKES OFFENSE AT U.S. </p><p>TRAVEL WARNING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Zim must not bow to hate campaign" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" used its January </p><p>      30 editorial to dismiss the January 27 travel warning. </p><p>      Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The travel warning issued by the United States State </p><p>      Department advising its citizens against traveling to </p><p>      Zimbabwe while also urging those already in the country to </p><p>      consider leaving is most unfortunate.  The basis on which </p><p>      the warning was issued is unfounded and only goes to show </p><p>      the extent to which the U.S. and its ally Britain will stop </p><p>      at nothing in their hate campaign against Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>      U.S. State Department alleges that this country is in the </p><p>      midst of political, economic and humanitarian crises that </p><p>      have affected security - nothing could be far from the </p><p>      truth (sic). </p><p> </p><p>      "There is peace and stability in the country and a </p><p>      few incidents of political violence reported </p><p>      recently cannot be used to tarnish the entire </p><p>      country\'s image.  Worse cases of violence are being </p><p>      reported in the U.S. itself everyday and other </p><p>      countries but no one has made noise about </p><p>      them. . .  We are all too aware of the fact that all </p><p>      this is being done to frustrate Zimbabwe\'s chances </p><p>      to host next month\'s Cricket World Cup. . . </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
