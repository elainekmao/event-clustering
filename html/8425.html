<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001568 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TRA, WHA/CAN, NEA, AND S/CT </p><p>PASS TSA FOR SUSAN WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, EAIR, PTER, PINR, CA, LE, Transportation </p><p>SUBJECT: NO AIR CANADA FLIGHTS TO BEIRUT NOW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Classified by Economic Minister Counselor Michael </p><p>Gallagher for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Transport Canada\'s Director of Security Jim Marriott </p><p>confirmed that the Canadian Transportation Agency, the </p><p>licensing arm of the Ministry, has suspended the license that </p><p>had been issued in March to Air Canada for flights from </p><p>Montreal to Beirut.  The reason for the suspension is </p><p>"national security."  Marriott said this was a "victory" for </p><p>those concerned about aviation security. Marriott added that </p><p>Canada will be watching very closely for signs of any </p><p>rapproachment between the U.S. and Lebanon (and Syria); in </p><p>particular, whether the USG changes its policy regarding </p><p>flights by U.S. carriers into Beirut. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Bruce Levy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and </p><p>International Trade (DFAIT) told us Transport Canada will </p><p>certainly be asked: 1. what has changed since the license was </p><p>issued in March? and, 2. what was the influence of the United </p><p>States on this decision?  Levy said the first question will </p><p>be very difficult to answer.  As for the second, Levy said he </p><p>had recommended that, if asked, Transport Candada acknowledge </p><p>that the USG had conveyed its views, but that the Canadian </p><p>goverment made the decision independently.  Levy added that </p><p>Air Canada has sold thousands of tickets for the Beirut </p><p>flights already, primarily to Canada\'s large Lebanese </p><p>community, so the decision to suspend the license for the </p><p>flights will not be greeted with hosannas by everyone - </p><p>especially as Air Canada is now in bankruptcy and needs </p><p>revenue. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Air Canada representatives had no comment on the issue </p><p>other than to say they expect to release a press announcement </p><p>today. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C). Comment:  While we let Canada know our views on this </p><p>issue very clearly at several levels, our approach has always </p><p>been private and behind the scenes.  We strongly recommend </p><p>that the Department and other agencies have minimal public </p><p>comment on this.  Given Canadian sensitivities about U.S. </p><p>pressure, undue focus on the U.S. role could complicate our </p><p>future security efforts. End Comment. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
