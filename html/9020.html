<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001672 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, MARR, KPKO, IZ, NL </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH PARLIAMENT SUPPORTS DEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN </p><p>IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: THE HAGUE </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: On June 25, the Dutch parliament gave the go- </p><p>ahead for deployment in the Stabilization Force of about </p><p>1,100 troops in the Al-Muthanna province in Iraq.   The </p><p>three government parties were supported by the opposition </p><p>Labor party and by smaller parties on the center-right. </p><p>Voting against were the opposition Socialist and Green Left </p><p>parties, as well as four dissidents from the Labor Party and </p><p>one from D66, a government party.  Defense Minister Kamp </p><p>reassured the Parliament that adequate arrangements had been </p><p>made for British and/or U.S. military assistance in the </p><p>event the Dutch troops were to get into trouble.  The 650 </p><p>Dutch marines and 450 support troops are scheduled to arrive </p><p>in Iraq by mid-July and to be operative in early August </p><p>after a few weeks of acclimatization.  The initial </p><p>deployment period is for six months.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. At a June 25 hearing of the parliamentary foreign affairs </p><p>and defense committees, Defense Minister Kamp convinced a </p><p>large majority that adequate arrangements had been made to </p><p>guarantee the safety of the Dutch troops in Iraq in a </p><p>possible emergency situation.  "If they get into trouble, we </p><p>can count on the British.  If necessary, there will be </p><p>assistance from the British division within six hours and </p><p>air support within 15 minutes."  Since the Dutch troops will </p><p>operate under British command, "they feel fully responsible </p><p>for us."  Besides, he said we have it "black on white" that </p><p>they will come to our assistance.   Kamp did not anticipate, </p><p>however, that it would come to that but he conceded that the </p><p>mission was not without risks.  "This is not a holiday trip </p><p>to Gran Canaria," he said.  Kamp assured the Parliament that </p><p>the armament of the Dutch troops was sufficiently "robust." </p><p>Unlike the situation in Srebrenica, he said the troops are </p><p>not sent off "with their hands tied behind their back." </p><p>Among the Dutch troops are sharp shooters and they will have </p><p>heavy machine guns and anti-tank weapons.   Kamp also </p><p>assured the Parliament that the troops had been well </p><p>prepared for their mission.   Various spokesmen expressed </p><p>concern about the death of six British soldiers earlier in </p><p>the week.  Kamp, however, viewed it as an unfortunate </p><p>incident and not as an organized campaign against the </p><p>British. </p><p> </p><p>3. A minority of opponents regarded UNSC resolution 1483 as </p><p>an insufficient basis for deployment, feared a repetition of </p><p>the misfortunes of Dutch troops in Srebrenica and objected </p><p>to what they viewed as the Dutch troops becoming part of the </p><p>U.S.-UK occupation force.  "As long as this is no UN </p><p>operation, we have no business there," said opposition Labor </p><p>party deputy floorleader Adri Duivesteijn, one of four </p><p>dissidents in the 42-member parliamentary group.  "What is </p><p>the legitimacy of this occupation force after a war in which </p><p>governments were deceived?" he questioned.  Minister Kamp </p><p>sneered at SP spokesman Van Bommel that "parties that oppose </p><p>peacekeeping no matter what have no right to speak."  He </p><p>pointed out that a clear distinction is being made between </p><p>countries that supply troops to the Stabilization Force and </p><p>the U.S. and UK as occupying forces, even though the </p><p>minister had to admit that this distinction may not be </p><p>obvious to the average Iraqi.  Foreign Minister De Hoop </p><p>Scheffer assured Parliament that the mission of the Dutch </p><p>troops was to advance peace and stability in Iraq, but </p><p>conceded that "serving the peace is more difficult than </p><p>waging war." </p><p> </p><p>Sobel </p><p></p></div>
