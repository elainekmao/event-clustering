<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002871 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY) </p><p>INFO IIP </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, APAOS, IOs, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: "INTEGRATION AND LEADERSHIP" </p><p> </p><p>  October 11, Editorial in "Tiempo"(San Pedro Sula-based </p><p>  Liberal paper owned by businessman and Congressional </p><p>  Deputy Rosenthal): "The new U.S. Ambassador to Honduras, </p><p>  Doctor Larry Palmer, has begun his diplomatic work </p><p>  announcing that the US will continue working for regional </p><p>  integration."  Obviously the U.S. government is convinced </p><p>  wisely that Central America\'s economic and social </p><p>  problems have a negative impact on the United States, </p><p>  mainly the substantial flow of illegal immigrants - these </p><p>  problems can not be resolved individually by each country </p><p>  but only regionally". </p><p> </p><p>  "Ambassador Palmer\'s statements should not be ignored </p><p>  because it shows the firmness of his country\'s stance on </p><p>  the Free Trade Agreement that is now being negotiated </p><p>  between the United States and the Hemisphere - a Free </p><p>  Trade Agreement good for Central America and the United </p><p>  States". </p><p> </p><p>  "The fact is that the conclusion of the NAFTA agreement </p><p>  between the United States and Canada can be seen not only </p><p>  as a tool for economic growth or as a commercial </p><p>  interchange, but as a way to help solve the social </p><p>  calamities of poverty and unemployment". Honduras </p><p>  understands the value of integration but until now has </p><p>  not taken any concrete action.  It is time to make an </p><p>  extra effort to put it into practice--it is an urgent </p><p>  task for real leaders". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer. </p><p></p></div>
