<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 008369 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND GUNARATNE </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MARKETS RALLY ON EU, CYPRUS NEWS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Honeymoon Continues; Economic Data Also Strong </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The two-week market rallies continued strongly on the </p><p>morning of November 18: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Treasury bill yields dropped 1.5 percentage points. With </p><p>the benchmark July 2 bill now at 49.5 percent, in compounded </p><p>terms, rates have dropped over 14 percentage points since the </p><p>November 3 elections. </p><p>-- The stock market, up 4.5 percent in morning trading, has </p><p>risen about 40 percent since the elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira appreciated about 1.5 percent since Friday, and </p><p>is now trading at TL 1,580,000 to the dollar.  This </p><p>represents appreciation from one year ago even in nominal </p><p>terms (not counting the approximately 35 percent inflation of </p><p>the past 12 months.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Year-end growth data continues to support an optimist </p><p>outlook.  The Turkish Treasury officially revised its </p><p>year-end 2002 projection upwards, from 3 to 4 percent GNP </p><p>growth.  Central Bank economist Ilker Domac says 4 percent </p><p>remains a conservative figure; the Central Bank\'s internal </p><p>projections have year-end growth at 4.4 percent.  Treasury </p><p>U/S Oztrak told us privately Treasury now projects 5 percent </p><p>growth.  Comment: The 2002 growth data has to be seen in </p><p>light of last year\'s decline of 9.7 percent:  this is a </p><p>partial recovery.  The tricky part now involves forecasting </p><p>2003 growth, and to do that we\'ll need to see the assumptions </p><p>in the new government\'s budget.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets React to Gul, Cyprus and EU News, </p><p>Less About the Economy </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Market analysts and participants tell us the </p><p>markets are being driven by the AK party\'s "sensible </p><p>positions on Cyprus, the EU and on relations with President </p><p>Sezer," according to Bender Securities strategist Murat </p><p>Gulkan.  The selection of Abdullah Gul as PM was also </p><p>welcome, since Gul is AK\'s best known figures to the </p><p>financial markets.  JP Morgan/Chase treasurer had a </p><p>cautionary note, telling us, "it\'s about Cyprus and the EU, </p><p>which means there\'s room for correction."  Disbank Treasurer </p><p>Bayazit concurred, adding that some Turkish banks are playing </p><p>the risky, but traditional game of borrowing dollars and </p><p>Euros to invest in lira instruments (especially T-bills.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  There have been some foreign inflows to the local </p><p>capital markets, though most of the buying continues to be </p><p>local, per brokers.  One broker told us that the Istanbul </p><p>Stock Exchange\'s largest U.S.  investor - Capital Assets </p><p>Management - has been selling most of its holdings into this </p><p>rally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Market participants also note that the new </p><p>government\'s economic policies are still not clear,  The </p><p>"One-Year Action Plan" released by AK Chairman Erdogan </p><p>November 16 had a mixed reception (see septel).  For now, the </p><p>markets are largely ignoring it, and focusing on the positive </p><p>approach of the new Government to political issues. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
