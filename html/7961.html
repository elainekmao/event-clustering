SUMMARY: Ongoing investigations at the Iraqi National </p><p>Museum are revealing the extent of losses from display </p><p>galleries and stores from the early April looting. Present </p><p>reports indicate 38 items, including some well-known pieces, </p><p>were lost from or damaged in the display galleries.  Tallies </p><p>of the restoration and storage rooms are still incomplete </p><p>and may take months to finish. Museum officials continue to </p><p>receive reports of looting of remote archeological sites. </p><p>About 50,000 manuscripts, from another building, are still </p><p>well-protected at a bomb shelter in a residential </p><p>neighborhood, but reports indicate losses at a smaller </p><p>manuscript collection. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE IRAQI NATIONAL MUSEUM: TALLYING THE LOSSES </p><p> </p><p>2.   Continuing work at the Iraqi National Museum is </p><p>clarifying the extent of the losses there. As of May 4, </p><p>investigators from U.S. Customs and the museum officials had </p><p>identified 38 lost or damaged items from among those in the </p><p>museum displays when it was looted. These items include </p><p>famous items such as the Sumerian sacred vase of Warca, </p><p>dated 3000 B.C, and a diorite statue from Ur with a </p><p>cuneiform inscription (ca. 2430 B.C.). Other well-known </p><p>missing items are the heads of three second-century A.D. </p><p>statues from Hatra, modeled on Greek originals from the </p><p>fourth century B.C. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Investigators have not completed work in the Museum\'s </p><p>restoration room, where a thorough investigation of debris </p><p>may reveal more lost or damaged items. Preliminary results </p><p>show 10 missing pieces and one damaged artifact - the famous </p><p>golden harp of Ur. Museum officials now believe that the </p><p>harp\'s original golden head had been replaced by a copy, now </p><p>stolen. Some of the best-known pieces still missing from the </p><p>restoration section include three eighth-century B.C. ivory </p><p>pieces from Nimrud. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Museum officials have begun their inventory of items </p><p>lost or damaged from the storage vaults, and the final </p><p>account may take months to complete. First results indicate </p><p>that most items taken from the vaults were small and </p><p>transportable: statues and cylinder seals. Confirming these </p><p>results were the content of a case returned to the museum by </p><p>INC forces, who reportedly found the items at a checkpoint. </p><p>Most of those items were of the sort described above. As of </p><p>May 5, the return of objects from individuals had slowed </p><p>down. Still unknown are the details about objects that </p><p>Jordanian officials have reportedly seized at the frontier </p><p> </p><p>5.   In a visit to the museum on May 5, we found the museum </p><p>officials particularly concerned about the integrity of </p><p>remote sites, particularly Sumerian remains in the south. </p><p>They were especially worried about uncontrolled digging.  An </p><p>ORHA officer reports in Hilla that the site museum and </p><p>expedition house at Babylon were looted, but there is no way </p><p>to know if looters have damaged the site itself. U.S. forces </p><p>have controlled access to the site of Ur, and are dropping </p><p>leaflets warning against disturbing other sites around </p><p>Nassiriya. </p><p> </p><p>MANUSCRIPTS IN THE BOMB SHELTER </p><p> </p><p>6.   On May 5, we also visited the National Manuscript </p><p>Center (formerly the Saddam Manuscript Center), which had </p><p>housed about 50,000 Arabic, Persian, Kurdish, Greek, and </p><p>Syriac manuscripts.  About four months before war broke out, </p><p>recalling the loss of manuscripts in 1991, employees, led by </p><p>Center\'s Chairman emeritus Ousama Naghshbandi, began moving </p><p>the manuscripts to a bomb shelter in a residential </p><p>neighborhood. The shelter is impressive: a one-story </p><p>windowless block with the precious items secured behind at </p><p>least three heavy steel doors. It would take a very </p><p>determined looter to break in, and the local inhabitants - </p><p>although not on good terms with Naghshbandi - have defended </p><p>the location. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Looters could not break into the barred and bricked-up </p><p>manuscript center itself, located in a 1920s house in </p><p>downtown Baghdad. They did, however, trash the neighboring </p><p>manuscript restoration center, although damage was limited </p><p>to loss of materials, air-conditioners, furniture, and </p><p>plumbing fixtures. Reports from other collections indicate </p><p>that manuscript collections at the Shiia religious centers </p><p>at Karbela and Najaf are undamageed. Looters did, however, </p><p>vandalize and pillage the manuscript library of the Ministry </p><p>of Awqaf and Religious Affairs, containing about 5,000 </p><p>items. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
