<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003617 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, US, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: EUROPEANS ASK IF U.S. WILL BE MORE FORTHCOMING ON </p><p>JORDAN DEBT RELIEF AT JULY 9 PARIS CLUB </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. PARIS 4438 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 3519 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  During a regular monthly breakfast meeting July 2, </p><p>new British Ambassador Christopher Prentice told the </p><p>Ambassador that HMG had been surprised by the conservative </p><p>stance of the USG on debt relief for Jordan at the June 20 </p><p>Paris Club meeting (ref a).  Prentice noted that PM Blair and </p><p>FonSec Straw had committed the UK to support "as generous as </p><p>possible" debt rescheduling for Jordan.  Straw\'s most recent </p><p>letter had actually indicated a willingness to join consensus </p><p>for "full stock rescheduling."  When the Ambassador said he </p><p>was not aware that the British representative presented this </p><p>position in Paris on June 20, Prentice confirmed that, </p><p>although the UK representative had instructions to be more </p><p>forthcoming, he remained silent in the face of the USG\'s </p><p>opposition to anything greater than Houston terms for Jordan. </p><p> Prentice added that he believes the UK is, in fact, prepared </p><p>to support "Houston plus" terms with a longer consolidation </p><p>period (as FinMin Marto requested of the Ambassador, ref b) </p><p>in the July 9 Paris Club meeting -- unless the U.S. again </p><p>opposes such relief. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DCM spoke separately July 2 with Spanish DCM Jose </p><p>Luis Cuerdo, who said that the general consensus among EU </p><p>states is to support rescheduling "on generous terms" for </p><p>Jordan.  Cuerdo concluded, based on discussions while Spain </p><p>was EU President, that EU member support for Jordan did not </p><p>go as far as it otherwise would have because the U.S. and </p><p>Japan were not prepared to join a more forthcoming consensus </p><p>at the June 20 meeting.  Cuerdo commented that Spain could </p><p>not support the complete debt reprofiling for which Jordan </p><p>had originally asked, but would support terms more generous </p><p>than those discussed on June 20, absent opposition from the </p><p>U.S. and Japan. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
