AGENDA ITEM 3 - STATE OF WORLD AGRICULTURAL MARKETS </p><p>(CCP 03/7).  THE U.S. INTERVENTION HIGHLIGHTED FACTUAL </p><p>ERRORS IN THE SECTION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.  THE UNITED </p><p>STATES SUGGESTED THAT THE FAO FOCUS FUTURE WORK ON </p><p>ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE EU\'S TRACEABILITY </p><p>REGULATIONS ON DEVELOPING COUNTRY EXPORTS INSTEAD OF </p><p>FOCUSSING ON "BALANCING CONSUMER CONCERNS WITH </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRY NEEDS", AS SUGGESTED IN THE PAPER. </p><p> </p><p>5.   MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION AFTER THE U.S. INTERVENTION </p><p>FOCUSSED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.  THE EU EMPHASISED THAT IT </p><p>DOES NOT BAN BIOTECH PRODUCTS, HAVING APPROVED 18 EVENTS </p><p>SINCE 1991.  SEVERAL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CALLED FOR PAO </p><p>TO ENGAGE IN MORE CAPACITY BUILDING EFFORTS SO THAT </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CAN GET THE FACTS ON BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>VERSUS PROPAGANDA FROM DIVERGENT SOURCES.

SEVERAL COUNTRIES (AUSTRALIA AND THE EU) TALKED </p><p>ABOUT THEIR WTO POSITIONS, WITH THE EU HIGHLIGHTING </p><p>THEIR "EVERYTHING BUT ARMS" AGREEMENT.  THAILAND, </p><p>SURPRISINGLY, RATHCR THAN VOICING ITS CAIRNS GROUP </p><p>POSITION IN THE WTO, CALLED FOR THE FAO TO INITIATE A </p><p>STUDY ON HOW TO STABILIZE COMMODITY PRICES, SPECIFICALLY </p><p>CITING THE RUBBER CARTEL AS A MODEL. </p><p> </p><p>7.   SEVERAL COUNTRIES (B </p><p>RAZIL AND CANADA) SAID THE </p><p>PAPER MIXED UP THE DISCUSSION OF FOOD SAFETY AND FOOD </p><p>QUALITY ISSUES.  CANADA SAID THAT CONSUMER CONCERNS GO </p><p>BEYOND FOOD SAFETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT AS STATED IN THE </p><p>PAPER.  CANADA SUGGESTED THAT FAO FOCUS FUTURE WORK ON </p><p>ANALYSING THE IMPACT ON DEVELOPING COUNTRY EXPORTS WHEN </p><p>COUNTRIES IMPOSE NON-HEALTH RELATED REQUIREMENTS </p><p>REGARDING PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES, GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS, </p><p>AND ANIMAL WELFARE. </p><p> </p><p>8.

THE U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01662  02 OF 04  171535Z </p><p>INTERVENTION FOCUSSED ON THE NEED FOR ALL COUNTRIES, </p><p>INCLUDING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, TO LOWER TARIFFS.  NO </p><p>OTHER COUNTRY SUPPORTED THIS POSITION.  SLOVAKIA </p><p>GENERALLY SUPPORTED THE U.S. POSITION BUT WANTED SPECIAL </p><p>PROVISIONS IN THE WTO FOR COUNTRIES IN TRANSITION. </p><p> </p><p>9.   SEVERAL COUNTRIES REITERATED THEIR WTO PROPOSALS, </p><p>CLAIMING THAT WHATEVER WAS IN THE PROPOSAL WAS </p><p>BENEFICIAL TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  JAPAN AND THE EU </p><p>SUPPORTED THE IDEA THAT LOWER TARIFFS, INCLUDING THOSE </p><p>PROPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES IN THE WTO WOULD HURT </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  AUSTRALIA CALLED FOR JAPAN AND </p><p>THE EU TO BE MORE AMBITIOUS IN THE WTO AGRICULTURE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, MALAYSIA, SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>AND OTHER CAIRNS MEMBERS SUPPORTED THE PAPER\'S PREMISE </p><p>THAT DOMESTIC SUPPORT AND HIGH TARIFFS IN DEVELOPED </p><p>COUNTRIES WERE THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF LIMITED MARKET </p><p>ACCESS AND LOW COMMODITY PRICES.  SEVERAL OF THESE </p><p>COUNTRIES SUPPORTED THE PAPER\'S VIEW THAT TARIFF PEAKS </p><p>AND ESCALATION PRESENTED SERIOUS CHALLENGES TO </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES\' ABILITY TO EXPORT PROCESSED </p><p>PRODUCTS.  THE EU EMPHASIZED THE BENEFITS OF </p><p>PREFERENTIAL TRADING AGREEMENTS.  INDONESIA WANTED TO </p><p>SEE THE WTO EXCLUDE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM ANY TARIFF </p><p>REDUCTIONS IN ORDER TO PROTECT DOMESTIC PRODUCERS. </p><p> </p><p>10.   BRAZIL PROPOSED THAT THE COMMITTEE DO A </p><p>COMPARATIVE STUDY OF "WINNERS AND LOSERS"  UNDER THE </p><p>CURRENT TRADING REGIME, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF TRADE BUT </p><p>ALSO FOREIGN DIRCCT INVESTMENTS.  ARGENTINA ALSO CALLED </p><p>FOR MORE FAO FUNDING FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01662  02 OF 04  171535Z </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION AND THE </p><p>INTERIM COMMISSION ON PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES.  TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE WAS NEEDED NOT ONLY TO HELP DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES MEET STANDARDS SET BY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT </p><p>ALSO TO HELP SET STANDARDS FOR IMPORTING DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES.  CANADA SUGGESTED THAT FAO ANALYSE THE IMPACT </p><p>OF STANDARDS BEING SET BY FOOD RETAILERS ON DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRY PRODUCERS AND EXPORTS.  NIGERIA SUPPORTED </p><p>CANADA\'S SUGGESTION. </p><p> </p><p>11.   AGENDA ITEM 5B- SOME TRADE POLICY ISSUES RELATING </p><p>TO TRENDS IN AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS IN THE CONTEXT OF FOOD </p><p>SECURITY (CCP 03/10).  THE THRUST OF THE SECRETARIAT\'S </p><p>PAPER WAS TO POINT OUT AN INCREASE IN IMPORT SURGES </p><p>(BROADLY DEFINED AS A 20 PERCENT INCREASE OVER THE 5- </p><p>YEAR TREND), PARTICULARLY SINCE URUGUAY ROUND </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION, AND TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF SUCH SURGES </p><p>ON THE FOOD SECURITY OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  THIS </p><p>ASSESSMENT WAS MADE BY COMPARING IMPORT TRENDS TO </p><p>PRODUCTION TRENDS.  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IMPORT </p><p>SURGES COULD HAVE EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES FOR FOOD SECURITY, THE PAPER MAINLY </p><p>FOCUSSED ON NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR LOW-INCOME FOOD </p><p>DEFICIT COUNTRIES (LIFDCS), I.E. PRODUCTION IMPACT, </p><p>INABILITY TO FINANCE SUCH IMPORTS.  IN PRESENTING THIS </p><p>PAPER, THE FAO SECRETARIAT POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS A </p><p>PROPOSAL FOR THE DOHA ROUND THAT RECOMMENDS A </p><p>STREAMLINED SAFEGUARD PROCEDURE FOR DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>12.   THE U.S. INTERVENTION EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01662  02 OF 04  171535Z </p><p>PAPER WAS MISLEADING IN THAT MOST OF THE COUNTRIES </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED IN "CASE STUDIES" CITED THEREIN WERE NOT </p><p>SUBJECT TO UR MINIMUM ACCESS DISCIPLINES, PER PARA 2 IN </p><p>ARTICLE 15 OF THE AGREEMENT ON AGRICULTURE.  A LIST OF </p><p>THE 30 EXCLUDED COUNTRIES WAS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE U.S. DEL POINTED OUT THA </p><p>T THE PAPER\'S MAIN </p><p>PREMISE, THAT FOOD SECURITY COULD BE ENHANCED BY RAISING </p><p>IMPORT BARRIERS, RAN COUNTER TO THE BODY OF RESEARCH </p><p>CONDUCTED BY INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>FAO ITSELF.  FINALLY, THE U.S. DEL SUGGESTED THAT THE </p><p>FAO FINE TUNE ITS RESEARCH IN THIS AREA SO THAT IT COULD </p><p>EFFECTIVELY HELP LIFDCS IN TARGETED COUNTRIES ADJUST TO </p><p>BOTH THE CHALLENGES AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE WORLD\'S </p><p>MORE OPEN TRADING ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>13.   THE AUSTRALIAN DEL ASSERTED THAT IMPORT SURGES </p><p>WERE DUE TO PRODUCTION SUBSIDIES IN THE EU, U.S. AND </p><p>JAPAN; AND THAT SUBSIDIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH </p><p>"INAPPROPRIATE FOOD AID" DISTORTED WORLD AGRICULTURAL </p><p>MARKETS TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF LDCS (LEAST DEVELOPED </p><p>COUNTRIES).  HE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE PAPERS </p><p>SEEMING ENCOURAGEMENT OF LDCS TO INCREASE THE USE OF </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9374 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01662  03 OF 04  171535Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00   E-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------57800D  171543Z /38 </p><p>R 171537Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9331 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2630 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 001662 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/ICD/DHUGHES; FAS/ITP/PSHEIKH, DHENKE, </p><p>SSCHWARTZ; FAS/EC/MCHAMBLISS, FAS/CMP/FLEE, EBERRY </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA/SKOTOK AND EB/TPP </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION TO THE U.N.

THE CANADIAN DEL ECHOED AUSTRALIAN </p><p>AND U.S. CONCERN ABOUT SAFEGUARDS AND, LIKE THE U.S., </p><p>ENCOURAGED THE SECRETARIAT TO FINE TUNE ITS ANALYSIS OF </p><p>IMPORT SURGES AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE. </p><p> </p><p>14.   THE JAPANESE, EU AND SOUTH KOREAN DELS UNDERSCORED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFEGUARD MEASURES, WITH JAPAN </p><p>PROPOSING THAT THE LEGITIMATE USE OF SUCH MEASURES BE </p><p>EXPANDED IN THE WTO.  THC EU ENCOURAGED THE FAO TO SHARE </p><p>ITS PAPER WITH THE WTO AND WENT ON TO ASSERT THAT </p><p>SPECIAL SAFEGUARDS FOR LDCS SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO </p><p>DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.  THE EU ALSO ENCOURAGED THE FAO TO </p><p>PROVIDE INSTITUTIONAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES THAT MIGHT </p><p>NEED TO MAKE USE OF EXISTING SAFEGUARDS.  KOREA ASSERTED </p><p>THAT IMPORT SURGES HAVE HURT ITS FOOD SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>15.   AGENDA ITEM 6 - INTERNATIONAL ACTION ON </p><p>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES AND TRADE.  INCLUDED IN THIS </p><p>ITEM WAS FOOD AID (CCP 03/2).  THE FAO SECRETARIAT </p><p>PRESENTED A PAPER THAT LARGELY FOCUSSED ON DONOR </p><p>COUNTRIES\' REPORTING OBLIGATIONS AND A SIGNIFICANT DROP </p><p>IN THE VOLUME OF FOOD AID TRANSACTIONS BEING NOTIFIED TO </p><p>THE COMMITTEE ON SURPLUS STOCKS DISPOSAL (CSSD) IN 2000 </p><p>AND 2001.  ISSUES RAISED BY MEMBER COUNTRIES IN THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2002 CSSD MEETING WERE ALSO SUMMARIZED IN THE </p><p>REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>16.   THE AUSTRALIAN DELEGATE CONDEMNED THE U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMCNT\'S USE OF FOOD AID, ASSERTING THAT IT IS TRADE </p><p>DISTORTING, A 100 PERCENT SUBSIDY AND PRIMARILY A </p><p>SURPLUS DISPOSAL MECHANISM.  HE ALSO UNDERSCORED THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01662  03 OF 04  171535Z </p><p>DISTRIBUTION VIA PRIVATE VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS (PVOS) </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE USED TO AVOID POOD AID CONVENTION </p><p>OBLIGATIONS.  HE PROPOSED THAT FOOD AID DONATIONS BE </p><p>MADE SOLELY IN CASH, WHEREBY THE DONOR COUNTRY WOULD </p><p>PURCHASE COMMODITIES FROM AN LDC OR EVEN A DIFFERENT </p><p>REGION OF THE RECIPIENT COUNTRY, AND THAT THE DONATION </p><p>BE FULLY A GRANT, NOT A CONCESSION LOAN, AND THAT IT NOT </p><p>BE TIED TO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS.  THE EU DEL, WHILE </p><p>AGREEING WITH AUSTRALIA THAT FOOD AID SHOULD BE IN FULL </p><p>GRANT FORM, NOTED THAT THE DEFINITION OF EMERGENCY FOOD </p><p>AID WAS NOT WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE CSSD AND SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT THE CSSD AWAIT THE RESULTS OF THE WTO NEGOTIATION </p><p>TO DETERMINE ITS ROLE.  BOTH DELS STRESSED THE NEED FOR </p><p>INCREASED TRANSPARENCY.  OTHER COUNTRIES WERE GENERALLY </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OF AUSTRALIA AND THE EU, INCLUDING NEW </p><p>ZEALAND, ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, HUNGARY AND MEXICO. </p><p> </p><p>17.   THE U.S. STATEMENT UNDERSCORED THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>IMPERATIVE FOR FOOD AID AND RESPONDED TO POINTS MADE IN </p><p>THE PAPER REGARDING REPORTING OF FOOD AID TRANSACTIONS. </p><p>THE U.S. ALSO CALLED FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY IN FOOD AID </p><p>TRANSACTIONS FOR ALL DONORS AND ENCOURAGED AN INCREASED </p><p>ROLE FOR THE CSSD IN THE FUTURE AGREEMENT ON AGRICULTURE </p><p>WITHIN THE WTO. </p><p> </p><p>18.   JAPAN SUPPORTED THE U.S. STATEMENT RECOGNIZING THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN NEED FOR FOOD AID.  JAPAN ENCOURAGES A </p><p>FLEXIBLE FRAMEWORK (I.E., LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES </p><p>SHOULD RECEIVE FULL GRANTS, BUT CONCESSION TERMS SHOULD </p><p>ALSO BE ALLOWABLE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL FOOD </p><p>AID NEEDS WOULD BE COVERED). </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01662  03 OF 04  171535Z </p><p> </p><p>19.   THE LDCS WERE SILENT ON THIS TOPIC WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF INDONESIA, WHICH PRESENTED A STATEMENT </p><p>UNDERSCORING THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>AND THE N </p><p>EED FOR SPEEDY DELIVERY.  ACKNOWLEDGING THAT </p><p>THE WTO IS TO PROVIDE A DEFINITION OF EMERGENCY FOOD </p><p>AID, THE INDONESIAN DEL UNDERSCORED THAT DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES NEED FOOD AID AND THAT COMPROMISE ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE IS REQUIRED. </p><p>20.   ADOPTION OF THE REPORT. AS THE UNITED STATES WAS </p><p>NOT IN THE DRAFTING COMMITTEE (CANADA REPRESENTED NORTH </p><p>AMERICA), THE U.S. DELEGATION SOUGHT IN THE FINAL </p><p>PLENARY TO INTRODUCE CHANGES TO THE FINAL REPORT.  THE </p><p>FIRST SUGGESTION SOUGHT TO REVISE A RECOMMENDATION THAT </p><p>THE FAO IDENTIFY "WINNERS AND LOSERS" FROM </p><p>"PROTECTIONISM" AND DOMESTIC SUPPORT TO MAKE THE </p><p>RECOMMENDATION LESS POLITICALLY CHARGED AND MORE </p><p>ANALYTICAL IN NATURE.  THE SECOND SUGGESTION AIMED AT </p><p>BALANCING THE RECORD OF THE FOOD AID DISCUSSION TO </p><p>INCLUDE THE POSITION CXPRESSED BY THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>OTHERS THAT FOOD AID DONATIONS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN </p><p>FOOD SECURITY AND SHOULD BE MADE IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE </p><p>FOOD AID CONVENTION AND DISCIPLINES TO BE ARTICULATED IN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9377 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01662  04 OF 04  171535Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00   E-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PER-00   ACE-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------578012  171543Z /38 </p><p>R 171537Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9332 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2631 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 04 OF 04 ROME 001662 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/ICD/DHUGHES; FAS/ITP/PSHEIKH, DHENKE, </p><p>SSCHWARTZ; FAS/EC/MCHAMBLISS, FAS/CMP/FLEE, EBERRY </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA/SKOTOK AND EB/TPP </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION TO THE U.N.
