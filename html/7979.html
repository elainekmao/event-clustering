THE D/S\'S REMARKS ON SYRIA, THE </p><p>ROADMAP, AND U.S. PLANS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ </p><p>WERE USED IN SUBSEQUENT ARTICLES AND EDITORIALS AND </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED BY OTHER UAE DAILIES AND REGIONAL SATELLITE </p><p>TV CHANNELS.  THIS EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW INJECTED BALANCE </p><p>INTO AL KHALEEJ\'S HARSH CONDEMNATIONS OF US FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY AND INTENTIONS IN THE REGION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON APRIL 20, 2003, "AL-KHALEEJ" HEADLINED FRONT-PAGE </p><p>EXCERPTS OF THE INTERVIEW.  THE MAIN HEADLINES READ: </p><p> </p><p>--"CONFIRMING THAT AMERICA WILL BE IN CHARGE OF IRAQ FOR </p><p>A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, ARMITAGE TELLS \'AL-KHALEEJ\': </p><p>SYRIA IS AT A CROSSROADS" </p><p>--"THE ROADMAP IS NOT SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION OR </p><p>BARGAINING" </p><p>--"THE UN ROLE IS VITAL, AND WE ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH PERLE ON ELIMINATING ITS ROLE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  "AL-KHALEEJ" ALSO DEVOTED AN ENTIRE INSIDE PAGE TO </p><p>THE FULL TRANSCRIPT OF DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE\'S </p><p>INTERVIEW.  THE HEADLINES ON PAGE 12 READ: </p><p> </p><p>--"ASSERTING THAT SYRIA MUST BE AWARE THAT THE SITUATION </p><p>HAS CHANGED, POWELL WILL DISCUSS THE PROPOSAL TO </p><p>ELIMINATE WMD FROM THE REGION WITH ASSAD" </p><p>--"ARMITAGE TELLS \'AL-KHALEEJ\': WE WILL RULE IRAQ FOR A </p><p>SHORT PERIOD AND HAVE NO LIST OF OTHER TARGETS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  ON THE SAME DAY, SISTER ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY "GULF </p><p>TODAY" POSTED AN ARTICLE ON THE INTERVIEW ON ITS FIRST </p><p>PAGE WITH THE FULL TRANSCRIPT ON AN INSIDE PAGE.  THE </p><p>FRONT-PAGE HEADLINE READ:  "NO TIMEFRAME FOR IRAQ: US </p><p>WILL NOT DEPART WITHOUT ENSURING SECURITY, SAYS </p><p>ARMITAGE," "PEACE \'ROAD MAP\' IS NOT NEGOTIABLE," AND "US </p><p>WILL NOT STAY IN IRAQ ONE DAY LONGER THAN NECESSARY." </p><p> </p><p>5.

THE COVERAGE ALSO REPEATED THE DEPUTY </p><p>SECRETARY\'S COMMENT THAT "THE US PRESENCE IN IRAQ WILL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>NOT BE ONE DAY LONGER THAN NECESSARY".  OVERALL, THE </p><p>EMINENTLY QUOTABLE DEPUTY SECRETARY BROUGHT BALANCE AND </p><p>OBJECTIVITY TO THE UAE MEDIA\'S DEBATE ON IRAQ, THE </p><p>ROADMAP, AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT: SINCE THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ, </p><p>POST HAS NOTED AN INCREASED WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF </p><p>LOCAL MEDIA TO ENGAGE WITH US AND WITH USG OFFICIALS. </p><p>THE DEPUTY SECRETARY\'S INTERVIEW WAS THE FIRST SUCH </p><p>INTERVIEW WE HAVE DONE WITH THE USUALLY ANTI-AMERICAN </p><p>(BUT INFLUENTIAL) AL-KHALEEJ. IT PAVED THE WAY FOR AN </p><p>INTERVIEW BY AL-KHALEEJ WITH AMBASSADOR WAHBA TWO WEEKS </p><p>LATER, AGAIN, A FIRST OF ITS KIND.  WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT </p><p>OPPORTUNITY AT THIS TIME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS </p><p>GREATER OPENNESS.  WE ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO </p><p>MAINTAIN THE INCREASED LEVEL OF INTERVIEWS BY SENIOR USG </p><p>OFFICIALS WITH THE ARAB MEDIA. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
