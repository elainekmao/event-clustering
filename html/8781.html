<p>S E C R E T THE HAGUE 001548 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ESP, S/CT, INR/EC, EUR/ERA, EUR/UBI, IO/PHO </p><p>TREASURY FOR AUFHAUSER, ZARATE, MURDEN </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OIA/FRIEDMAN </p><p>FBI FOR LORMEL </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR LEGATT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PTER, EUN NL </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCING: ADDITIONAL DUTCH RESPONSE ON </p><p>HAMAS-RELATED DESIGNATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. THE HAGUE 1531 </p><p>     B. STATE 163613 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Jess Baily Reason 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (S) Dutch officials told us 6/16 that at the EU Foreign </p><p>Ministers Meeting, Dutch FM de Hoop Scheffer plans to stress </p><p>the need for the EU to take urgent action against Hamas </p><p>(including clearinghouse designation), to urge that the EU </p><p>exert influence on Middle East leaders to stop funding for </p><p>Hamas, and to urge the Palestinian Authority devote more </p><p>attention and resources to humanitarian shortfalls that might </p><p>occur if the flow of funds to Hamas were stopped or slowed. </p><p>Dutch officials hope that the outcome will be a European </p><p>Council political declaration calling for the dismantling of </p><p>the "terrorist networks of Hamas."  Dutch Prime Minister </p><p>Balkenende has indicated he is prepared to raise the issue </p><p>before the Council. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) The officials were not optimistic that the EU would </p><p>be able to formally designate all ref b entities by June 25. </p><p>If no EU member objects to the Dutch proposal, Al Aqsa </p><p>Foundation could be designated on June 23 (note: the Dutch do </p><p>not believe there is a clearinghouse meeting June 23 but </p><p>indicate this is the expiration date for completion of the </p><p>"silence procedure" concerning Al Aqsa Foundation. end note) </p><p>Because designation of Hamas has already been formally </p><p>proposed, Hamas could be added to the EU designation list if </p><p>remaining reserves are lifted.  The Dutch believe that the </p><p>French position will be the primary determinant of whether </p><p>existing reserves are lifted.  However, procedural issues </p><p>will likely (according to the Dutch) prevent the other ref b </p><p>individuals and entities from being quickly designated.  Even </p><p>with a political impulse from the EU Council, for the </p><p>entities to be designated, a member state would have to </p><p>propose clearinghouse designation, an evidenciary file </p><p>(preferably a judicial file) submitted, and sufficient time </p><p>given to all the member states to study the evidence.  If EU </p><p>consideration goes smoothly, the Dutch believe EU designation </p><p>is unlikely to take place before August.  If consideration is </p><p>favorable but not entirely smooth, designation might not take </p><p>place before the Fall. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) In order to facilitate EU designation, the Dutch will </p><p>work to get language into the EU Council declaration </p><p>directing EU bodies to act as quickly as possible in taking </p><p>action against Hamas. They will work to ensure the language </p><p>specifically calls for taking action against the finances of </p><p>Hamas, its leaders, and those that raise funds for it. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) The Dutch are also considering urging stricter </p><p>control over all funds going into the areas controled by the </p><p>Palestinian authority, including wire transfers. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
