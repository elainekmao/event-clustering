<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L PHNOM PENH 000922 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, BM, CB </p><p>SUBJECT: CAMBODIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SUPPORTS RELEASE OF </p><p>AUNG SAN SUU KYI </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 146687 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR CHARLES A. RAY.  REASON: 1.5 (B) (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) DURING A JUNE 4 MEETING ON THE CAMBODIAN ELECTIONS </p><p>AND COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION (SEPTEL), THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ASKED FOREIGN MINISTER HOR NAMHONG TO WEIGH IN WITH THE SPDC </p><p>TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI.  OBSERVING THAT </p><p>THE DETENTION OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE </p><p>REPUTATION OF ASEAN AS A WHOLE, THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>CAMBODIA AS THE ASEAN CHAIR COULD PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN </p><p>CONVINCING THE SPDC TO RELEASE HER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) INDICATING THAT HE WAS AWARE OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OUTRAGE AT THE DETENTION, HOR NAMHONG RESPONDED THAT HE HAD </p><p>JUST GIVEN AN INTERVIEW TO NHK, THE JAPANESE TELEVISION </p><p>NETWORK.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD RELATED TO NHK THAT ASEAN HAD </p><p>BEEN PLEASED WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS IN BURMA OVER THE LAST </p><p>COUPLE OF YEARS, INCLUDING AUNG SAN SUU KYI\'S RELEASE FROM </p><p>HOUSE ARREST, THE DIALOGUE WITH THE SPDC AND THE FREEDOM SHE </p><p>HAD TO MOVE AROUND THE COUNTRY.  NOW, HE SAID, ASEAN WAS "NOT </p><p>VERY HAPPY."  HOR NAMHONG SAID THAT HE COMMENTED THAT HE </p><p>HOPED THE SITUATION WOULD SOON RETURN TO NORMAL.  THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER ADDED THAT ASEAN\'S PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERFERENCE IN </p><p>THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF MEMBER COUNTRIES PREVENTED HIM FROM </p><p>TAKING DIRECT ACTION WITH BURMA UNLESS INVITED.  HE NOTED TO </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR ALSO THAT BURMA\'S ACTIONS WOULD BE A TOPIC FOR </p><p>DISCUSSION AT THE ARF/PMC MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT.  WHILE NOT PERHAPS AS MUCH AS WE WANTED FROM </p><p>HOR NAMHONG, HIS PUBLIC EXPRESSION OF UNHAPPINESS WITH THE </p><p>SPDC\'S ACTIONS IS PROBABLY THE MOST WE COULD HOPE FOR.  THE </p><p>ARF WILL, OF COURSE, PROVIDE A FORUM FOR CONCERNED NATIONS TO </p><p>EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ON THE SPDC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p></p></div>
