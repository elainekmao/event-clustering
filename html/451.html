CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>/------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING A MARCH 31 - APRIL 3 TRIP TO TBILISI, </p><p>POLOFF RELAYED THE TALKING POINTS IN REF A TO </p><p>GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET CHAIRMAN GAMSAKHURDIA AND </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF SEEKING A MECHANISM FOR </p><p>PEACEFUL DIALOGUE TO RESOLVE THE MANY PROBLEMS </p><p>GEORGIA FACES.  GAMSAKHURDIA INSISTED THAT HE HAD </p><p>BEEN FORCED TO TAKE EXCEPTIONALLY HARSH MEASURES </p><p>AGAINST THE OSSETIANS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN LEAGUE </p><p>WITH MOSCOW.  GAMSAKHURDIA EXPLAINED THAT THE CENTER </p><p>HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE ECONOMIC PRESSURE TO FORCE </p><p>GEORGIA TO SUCCUMB TO ITS WISHES AND NOW MOSCOW WAS </p><p>RESORTING TO POLITICAL SABOTAGE.  GAMSAKHURDIA </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE CENTER WAS ANGRY BECAUSE THE </p><p>REPUBLIC\'S CITIZENS HAD VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY FOR </p><p>GEORGIAN INDEPENDENCE IN THE MARCH 31 REFERENDUM.  HE </p><p>FELT THAT MOSCOW WOULD MAKE FURTHER EFFORTS TO </p><p>PROVOKE A CONFRONTATION AS A PRETEXT FOR IMPOSING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL RULE IN GEORGIA.  GAMSAKHURDIA ALSO SAID </p><p>HE FELT BETRAYED BY YEL\'TSIN BECAUSE THE RSFSR LEADER </p><p>HAD RENOUNCED THE AGREEMENT THEY HAD SIGNED EARLIER </p><p>IN MARCH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THIS IS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF THREE REPORTS ON </p><p>POLITICS IN SOVIET GEORGIA.  THIS CABLE FOCUSES ON </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA\'S CONFRONTATION WITH THE CENTER OVER </p><p>SOUTH OSSETIA AND RELATIONS WITH OTHER REPUBLICS. </p><p>THE SECOND REPORT DEALS WITH GEORGIA\'S INTERNAL </p><p>POLITICS.  THE THIRD WILL COVER A TRIP POLOFF MADE TO </p><p>A KGB PRISON AND A CONVERSATION WITH THE LAWYER OF </p><p>THE IMPRISONED OSSETIAN LEADER KULUNBEGOV. </p><p> </p><p>A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR GAMSAKHURDIA </p><p>/------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. POLOFF ARRIVED IN GEORGIA LATE ON MARCH 31, THE </p><p>DAY OF THE REFERENDUM ON GEORGIAN INDEPENDENCE AND </p><p>ALSO GAMSAKHURDIA\'S BIRTHDAY.  GAMSAKHURDIA SENT </p><p>GEORGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GEORGIY KHOSHTARIA TO THE </p><p>AIRPORT TO GREET POLOFF AND WHISK HER AWAY TO A </p><p>BIRTHDAY/REFERENDUM CELEBRATION HELD AT AN OPULENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT HOUSE OVERLOOKING THE CITY.  MANY OF </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA\'S CLOSEST FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS WERE IN </p><p>ATTENDANCE INCLUDING FOREIGN MINISTER KHOSHTARIA, </p><p>PRIME MINISTER TENGIZ SIGUA, AND ALL OF THE OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF HIS GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE PRELIMINARY REFERENDUM RETURNS WERE ANNOUNCED </p><p>AS THEY CAME IN.  WITH EACH NEW ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT </p><p>THE OVERWHELMING VOTE IN VARIOUS REGIONS IN FAVOR OF </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, THE CELEBRANTS MADE MORE TOASTS AND </p><p>BECAME ALMOST DELIRIOUS WITH THEIR VICTORY.  THE </p><p>BANQUET WAS LAID OUT IN TYPICAL GEORGIAN FASHION WITH </p><p>PLATES FULL OF GEORGIAN DELICACIES AND FREE-FLOWING </p><p>LIQUOR OF ALL SORTS.  POLOFF ARRIVED RATHER LATE INTO </p><p>THE CELEBRATION AND GAMSAKHURDIA WAS ALREADY INTO HIS </p><p>SECOND ROUND OF TOASTS OFFERED TO MOST OF HIS MANY </p><p>GUESTS.  THE TOASTS WERE INTERSPERSED WITH TYPICAL </p><p>GEORGIAN SINGING WHICH CONSISTS OF A FOUR-PART </p><p>HARMONY A CAPPELLA.  ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING </p><p>TOASTS OFFERED BY THE MINISTER OF FINANCE BEGAN WITH </p><p>REGRET THAT GEORGIA WAS REMEMBERED ONLY AS STALIN\'S </p><p>BIRTHPLACE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  PRIME MINISTER SIGUA (PROTECT) SAT NEXT TO POLOFF </p><p>AND TOLD HER THAT IT WAS HIS IDEA THAT GAMSAKHURDIA </p><p>ATTEND THE MARCH 16 DINNER IN MOSCOW WITH SECRETARY </p><p>BAKER.  SIGUA SAID THE CENTER HAD DISCOURAGED ALL </p><p>REPUBLIC LEADERS FROM ATTENDING AND THAT WAS WHY </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA HAD ARRIVED AFTER ANNOUNCING OVER THE </p><p>TELEPHONE THAT HE WAS NOT COMING.  SIGUA SAID THAT </p><p>GORBACHEV HAD SUCCESSFULLY PRESSURED MOST OF THE </p><p>OTHER REPUBLIC LEADERS TO DECLINE THE SECRETARY\'S </p><p>INVITATION. </p><p> </p><p>GEORGIA\'S DISPUTE WITH THE CENTER INTENSIFIES </p><p>/-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  POLOFF MET WITH GAMSAKHURDIA SEVERAL TIMES DURING </p><p>THE VISIT TO DISCUSS GEORGIAN POLITICS AND THE </p><p>DEVELOPING POLITICAL DRAMA BETWEEN GEORGIA AND </p><p>MOSCOW.  POLOFF DREW ON POINTS OUTLINED IN REF A </p><p>DURING DISCUSSIONS WITH GAMSAKHURDIA AND EMPHASIZED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF FINDING A PEACEFUL MECHANISM FOR </p><p>THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES.  GAMSAKHURDIA FELT THAT </p><p>HE HAD OFFERED MORE THAN ONCE TO RESOLVE HIS DISPUTES </p><p>WITH THE CENTER THROUGH PEACEFUL DIALOGUE BUT WAS </p><p>REBUFFED BY MOSCOW.  HE RECOUNTED SEVERAL RECENT </p><p>CONFRONTATIONS WITH USSR LEADERS OVER THE UNION </p><p>TREATY, SOUTH OSSETIA, AND THE GEORGIAN MVD. </p><p> </p><p>8.  GAMSAKHURDIA REFERRED TO A FEBRUARY 25 </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH GORBACHEV IN WHICH THE SOVIET </p><p>LEADER REPORTEDLY WARNED GAMSAKHURDIA THAT IF HE DID </p><p>NOT SIGN THE UNION TREATY, GEORGIA WOULD FACE EVEN </p><p>MORE VIOLENCE AND POLITICAL UNREST.  HE ALSO SHOWED </p><p>POLOFF COPIES OF TELEGRAMS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM </p><p>MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS BORIS PUGO AND GORBACHEV </p><p>WARNING HIM TO COMPLY WITH USSR DECREES OR FACE THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES.  GAMSAKHURDIA SAID HE STILL HAS NO </p><p>INTENTION OF SENDING EVEN OBSERVERS TO THE UNION </p><p>TREATY NEGOTIATIONS AND THE GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET </p><p>WOULD NOT EVEN BE DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ON APRIL 7, THE GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET PRESIDIUM </p><p>PASSED A RESOLUTION PROTESTING THE ADDITION OF </p><p>FURTHER SOVIET TROOPS IN SOUTH OSSETIA AS A "RUDE </p><p>VIOLATION OF GEORGIAN SOVEREIGNTY," ACCORDING TO </p><p>GEORGIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER GEORGIY KHONELIDZE </p><p>(PROTECT), WHO CALLED POLOFF THAT SAME DAY.  THE </p><p>RESOLUTION DECRIES THE USE OF TROOPS AGAINST SOCIETY </p><p>AND EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THE CENTER WOULD REFRAIN </p><p>FROM FURTHER DESTABLIZING THE SITUATION IN THE </p><p>REPUBLIC.  THE RESOLUTION ALSO CALLS FOR A PEACEFUL </p><p>DIALOGUE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE OSSETIAN </p><p>PROBLEM.  THE RESOLUTION EMPHASIZED GEORGIA\'S INTENT </p><p>TO LEGALLY SEEK INDEPENDENCE AND INITIATE DIRECT </p><p>ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND CULTURAL RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>RSFSR, ARMENIA, AZERBAYDZHAN AND OTHER REPUBLICS. </p><p>KHONELIDZE ALSO TOLD POLOFF THAT GEORGIA\'S WORKERS </p><p>WERE PREPARING TO CALL FOR A GENERAL STRIKE IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE MINERS AS A RESULT OF THE PRICE RISES </p><p>AND CONTINUED PARTIAL ECONOMIC BLOCKADE. </p><p> </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA SEES CENTER\'S HAND IN SOUTH OSSETIA </p><p>/-------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>10.  GAMSAKHURDIA INSISTED THAT THE CENTER WAS </p><p>FUELING THE OSSETIAN PROBLEM AND THAT GORBACHEV HAD </p><p>REFUSED TO ENGAGE IN ANY KIND OF DIALOGUE ON THE </p><p>PROBLEM.  THE GEORGIAN LEADER ACCUSED USSR COUNCIL OF </p><p>NATIONALITIES CHAIRMAN RAFIK NISHANOV OF </p><p>MASTERMINDING THE CENTER\'S MANIPULATION OF OSSETIA. </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA CLAIMED THAT ARRESTING OSSETIAN LEADER </p><p>KULUNBEGOV WAS "THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE BLOODSHED </p><p>AND DEFUSE THE SITUATION." (SEE SEPTEL FOR FURTHER </p><p>INFORMATION ON KULUNBEGOV\'S DETENTION.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  GAMSAKHURDIA CLAIMED THAT GEORGIA WOULD BE </p><p>WILLING TO ALLOW THE OSSETIANS TO HOLD A REFERENDUM </p><p>ON AUTONOMY BUT ONLY AFTER GEORGIA ACHIEVED </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  HE SAID THAT NOW THEY COULD NOT BE </p><p>SURE WHETHER THE OSSETIANS GENUINELY WANTED POLITICAL </p><p>AUTONOMY OR WHETHER THEY WERE BEING DRIVEN BY THE </p><p>CENTER TO DEMAND THIS AUTONOMY.  AS IN PAST </p><p>CONVERSATIONS (REFS C-E), HE ROUTINELY REFERRED TO </p><p>THE OSSETIANS AND THEIR LEADERS AS "CRIMINALS" AND </p><p>"TERRORISTS."  HE CLAIMED THAT HE HAD ORDERED AN END </p><p>TO THE GEORGIAN BLOCKADE OF TSKHINVALI BUT THAT </p><p>"BANDS OF CRIMINALS" CONTINUED TO SABOTAGE THE </p><p>OSSETIANS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WHEN POLOFF SUGGESTED THAT INNOCENT OSSETIANS, </p><p>SUCH AS TSKHINVALI\'S CHILDREN, MIGHT BE SUFFERING, </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA AGAIN BLAMED THE OSSETIANS FOR THE </p><p>PROBLEM.  HE CLAIMED THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT THIS FATE </p><p>UPON THEMSELVES BY CONTINUING TO DEMAND AUTONOMY.  HE </p><p>ALSO ASSERTED THAT "BANDS OF OSSETIAN CRIMINALS" WERE </p><p>FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER --A POINT THE OSSETIANS </p><p>DENY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  ON THE EVENING OF APRIL 2, POLOFF SAT WITH </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA IN HIS OFFICE IN THE GEORGIAN SUPREME </p><p>SOVIET AND WATCHED THE SOVIET NEWS PROGRAM "VREMYA" </p><p>WHICH WAS FEATURING AN ITEM ON THE VIOLENCE IN </p><p>TSKHINVALI.  "THEY ARE ANGRY BECAUSE WE HAD SUCH AN </p><p>OVERWHELMING VICTORY IN THE REFERENDUM ON </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  NOW THEY ARE PREPARING THE GROUND TO </p><p>SEND IN TROOPS TO TAKE OVER OSSETIA AND MAYBE THE </p><p>REPUBLIC," HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THOSE WORDS PROVED TO BE PROPHETIC BECAUSE </p><p>GORBACHEV BEGAN TO SEND IN ADDITIONAL TROOPS TO SOUTH </p><p>OSSETIA THE NEXT DAY.  ON ALRIL 3, GAMSAKHURDIA TOLD </p><p>POLOFF HE HAD SPOKEN TO USSR SUPREME SOVIET CHAIRMAN </p><p>LUK\'YANOV BY TELEPHONE ABOUT THE TROOPS BEING SENT TO </p><p>SOUTH OSSETIA.  GAMSAKHURDIA SAID HE HAD WARNED </p><p>LUK\'YANOV THAT MORE TROOPS WOULD INCREASE BLOODSHED </p><p>IN THE REGION AND THAT HE AND GORBACHEV WOULD BE HELD </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS BLOODSHED.  LUK\'YANOV REPLIED </p><p>THAT HE WOULD PASS THIS MESSAGE TO GORBACHEV. </p><p>LUK\'YANOV ALSO TOLD GAMSAKHURDIA THAT THE RSFSR </p><p>CONGRESS\' RESOLUTION CALLING ON GORBACHEV TO "TAKE </p><p>URGENT MEASURES TO NORMALIZE THE SITUATION IN SOUTH </p><p>OSSETIA" HAD HEAVILY INFLUENCED GORBACHEV\'S DECISION </p><p>TO SEND MORE TROOPS.  GAMSAKHURDIA ASKED LUK\'YANOV, </p><p>"WHAT RIGHT DOES THE RSFSR HAVE TO TELL THE CENTER </p><p>WHAT TO DO IN GEORGIA?"  THE GEORGIAN LEADER SAID HE </p><p>CONSIDERED THIS INTERFERENCE IN GEORGIA\'S INTERNAL </p><p>AFFAIRS.  HE SAID LUK\'YANOV HAD NO ANSWER AND WAS </p><p>SILENT. </p><p> </p><p>15.  GAMSAKHURDIA TOLD POLOFF THAT ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>GEORGIAN MVD COMMANDANT IN TSKHINVALI, THE CENTER </p><p>PLANNED TO SEND IN THE DZHERZHINSKIY DIVISION TO </p><p>IMPOSE ORDER IN SOUTH OSSETIA.  THIYSPARTICULAR </p><p>DIVISION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BRUTAL TREATMENT OF </p><p>AZERBAYDZHANIS IN BAKU IN JANUARY 1990. </p><p> </p><p>16.  GAMSAKHURDIA CLAIMED THAT THE CENTER WAS </p><p>FUNNELING WEAPONS THROUGH THE SOVIET ARMY TO THE </p><p>OSSETIANS.  HE TOOK POLOFF TO A ROOM WITH A DISPLAY </p><p>OF SOVIET ARMY WEAPONS ALLEGEDLY CONFISCATED FROM THE </p><p>OSSETIANS.  THE GEORGIAN LEADER ALSO SHOWED POLOFF A </p><p>ROCKET WHICH ALLEGEDLY HAD BEEN USED IN AN ATTACK ON </p><p>A GEORGIAN VILLAGE NEAR TSKHINVALI.  THE ROCKET HAD </p><p>KILLED A GEORGIAN FAMILY OF FIVE AND WAS THE SAME </p><p>TYPE USED IN THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN, ACCORDING TO A </p><p>GEORGIAN VETERAN OF THAT WAR.  GAMSAKHURDIA USED THIS </p><p>EXHIBIT TO ILLUSTRATE THAT OSSETIANS WERE NOT THE </p><p>ONLY ONES SUFFERING IN THIS CONFRONTATION.  THE </p><p>GEORGIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO HAD SEVERAL GEORGIAN </p><p>REFUGEES FROM TSKHINVALI ON DISPLAY IN THE LOBBY OF </p><p>THE INTOURIST HOTEL IVERIA WITH SIGNS WRITTEN ONLY IN </p><p>ENGLISH PROTESTING OSSETIAN ACTS AGAINST GEORGIA. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE REFUGEES\' SUFFERING APPEARED TO BE </p><p>GENUINE, THEIR USE AS PAWNS IN A POLITICAL PROPAGANDA </p><p>GAME WAS OBVIOUS AND A BIT CRUDE. </p><p> </p><p>17.  INTERESTINGLY, GEORGIAN REPUBLIC OPPOSITION </p><p>LEADERS ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE OSSETIANS ARE "TOOLS OF </p><p>THE KGB" AND THAT OSSETIAN LEADER CHOCHIYEV IS A KGB </p><p>OFFICER.  LIKE GAMSAKHURDIA, THE GEORGIAN NATIONAL </p><p>CONGRESS LEADERS BELIEVE THAT OSSETIANS SHOULD BE </p><p>GRANTED CULTURAL BUT NOT POLITICAL AUTONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC PRESSURE INEFFECTIVE AGAINST GEORGIA </p><p>/-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  GAMSAKHURDIA ASSERTED THAT THE CENTER\'S ATTEMPTS </p><p>TO USE ECONOMIC PRESSURE AGAINST GEORGIA HAD FAILED </p><p>FOR SEVERAL REASONS.  HE SAID THAT GEORGIA HAD BEEN </p><p>ABLE TO RETALIATE AGAINST THE CENTER\'S ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>USE ECONOMIC PRESSURE BY THREATENING TO CLOSE THE </p><p>REPUBLIC\'S RAILWAYS AND PORTS.  HE SAID THAT THIS </p><p>TACTIC HAD BEEN EFFECTIVE DURING THE REPUBLIC\'S </p><p>DISPUTES WITH MOSCOW LAST SUMMER WHEN GEORGIA WAS </p><p>ABLE TO FORCE THE CENTER TO GIVE INTO ITS DEMANDS ON </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY.  GAMSAKHURDIA POINTED OUT THAT BECAUSE </p><p>OF THE ARMENIAN-AZERBAYDZHANI CONFLICT, GEORGIA\'S </p><p>RAILWAYS WERE THE ONLY ONES FULLY FUNCTIONING IN THE </p><p>CAUCASUS AND THEREFORE CONSTITUTED A CRITICAL </p><p>TRANSPORTATION LINK TO THE REST OF THE USSR. </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA ALSO POINTED OUT THAT MANY SOVIET </p><p>MILITARY FAMILIES LIVED IN GEORGIA AND THEY TOO WOULD </p><p>SUFFER FROM ANY MORE SHORTAGES OF FOOD AND ENERGY. </p><p>IN ADDITION, THE NON-GEORGIANS IN THE REPUBLIC WOULD </p><p>PAY A PRICE FOR ANY ECONOMIC SANCTIONS OR DEPRIVATION </p><p>IMPOSED ON GEORGIA. </p><p> </p><p>19.  GAMSAKHURDIA OBSERVED THAT THE ECONOMIC WEAPON </p><p>WAS NOT GEORGIAN-SPECIFIC AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE </p><p>USED EFFECTIVELY TO STEM GEORGIAN NATIONALISM AND THE </p><p>DESIRE FOR INDEPENDENCE.  HE MAINTAINED THAT THE </p><p>CENTER WAS MORE LIKELY TO USE A COMBINATION OF </p><p>POLITICAL AND MILITARY PRESSURE SUCH AS IMPOSING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL RULE, INSTEAD OF ECONOMIC THREATS WHICH </p><p>HAD PROVEN INEFFECTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>BETRAYED BY YEL\'TSIN </p><p>/------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  GAMSAKHURDIA SAID HE COULD NO LONGER TRUST RSFSR </p><p>LEADER BORIS YEL\'TSIN "BECAUSE ONE DAY HE SAYS ONE </p><p>THING AND THE NEXT DAY HE SAYS THE OPPOSITE." </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA WAS REFERRING TO THE PROTOCOL HE HAD </p><p>SIGNED WITH YEL\'TSIN ON MARCH 23.  THE PROTOCOL </p><p>STIPULATED RSFSR-GEORGIAN COOPERATION IN QUELLING THE </p><p>OSSETIAN CONFLICT WITHOUT THE CENTER\'S INTERFERENCE. </p><p>THE PROTOCOL ALSO CALLED FOR CLOSER POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN THE REPUBLICS IN THE </p><p>FUTURE.  GAMSAKHURDIA AND OTHER GEORGIAN OFFICIALS </p><p>SUCH AS GEORGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER KHOSHTARIA ON </p><p>PREVIOUS OCCASIONS HAD EMPHASIZED THE GREAT </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROTOCOL FOR GEORGIA\'S FUTURE (REF </p><p>B). </p><p> </p><p>21.  GAMSAKHURDIA TOLD POLOFF THAT YEL\'TSIN WAS </p><p>"FIGHTING FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE IN THE RSFSR </p><p>CONGRESS AND HE HAD TO GIVE UP HIS AGREEMENT WITH US </p><p>IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS OWN POLITICAL FUTURE."  THE </p><p>GEORGIAN LEADER SAID YEL\'TSIN HAD REJECTED THE </p><p>PROTOCOL AS A SOP TO THE RSFSR COMMUNIST PARTY. </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA CONTINUED TO LAMBAST YEL\'TSIN AND HIS </p><p>PERSONAL CHARACTER SAYING THAT THE RSFSR LEADER IS A </p><p>"DRUNKARD AND OBVIOUSLY UNTRUSTWORTHY."  "YEL\'TSIN </p><p>WILL DO ANYTHING TO SAVE HIS SKIN," GAMSAKHURDIA </p><p>SAID.  INTERESTINGLY, ONLY A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE, </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA HAD BEEN SINGING YEL\'TSIN\'S PRAISES AND </p><p>STRESSING THAT YEL\'TSIN WAS THE SOVIET UNION\'S ONLY </p><p>HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.  GAMSAKHURDIA ALSO CRITICIZED </p><p>USSR PEOPLE\'S DEPUTY GALINA STAROVOYTOVA FOR HER ROLE </p><p>IN BACKING THE SOUTH OSSETIANS\' CAUSE. </p><p> </p><p>22.  LENINGRAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MATLOCK </p><p></p></div>
