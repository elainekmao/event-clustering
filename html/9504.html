<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 07 ANKARA 004525 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL AND EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: DRAFT 2003 IRF </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 194330 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. The following text is the draft 2003 report on </p><p>International Religious Freedom (IRF) for Turkey: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the </p><p>Government generally respects this right in practice; </p><p>however, the Government imposes some restrictions on </p><p>religious groups and on religious expression in government </p><p>offices and state-run institutions, including universities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. There was no significant change in the status of respect </p><p>for religious freedom during the period covered by this </p><p>report.  Some Muslims, Christians, and Baha,is faced some </p><p>restrictions and occasional harassment, including detentions </p><p>for alleged proselytizing or unauthorized meetings.  The </p><p>Government continued to oppose "Islamic fundamentalism."  An </p><p>intense debate continues over a broad government ban on </p><p>wearing Muslim religious dress in state facilities, including </p><p>universities, schools, and workplaces.  Following the June </p><p>2001 closure of the Islamist-led Fazilet (Virtue) party for </p><p>"antisecular activities," two new political parties were </p><p>formed.  Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of </p><p>one of these new parties, the Islam-influenced AK Party, and </p><p>former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, the leader of the </p><p>other, the Islamist Saadet Party, were banned from </p><p>participating in the November 2002 national elections due to </p><p>past convictions for illegal speech.    Erdogan was later </p><p>able to enter Parliament and become Prime Minister, and </p><p>Erbakan was able to assume the formal leadership of Saadet, </p><p>when the terms of their bans from politics ended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Government policy and the generally calm relationship </p><p>among religions in society protect religious freedom in </p><p>principle.  All citizens of Turkey carry an identification </p><p>card that  lists their religion.  Moreover, Christians, </p><p>Baha\'is and some Muslims face societal suspicion and mistrust </p><p>and more radical Islamist elements continue to express </p><p>anti-Jewish sentiments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The U.S. Government frequently discusses religious freedom </p><p>issues with the Government in the context of its overall </p><p>dialog and policy of promoting human rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>SECTION 1: RELIGIOUS DEMOGRAPHY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The country has a total area of 301,394 square miles, and </p><p>its population is approximately 67.8  million.  Approximately </p><p>99 percent of the population is Muslim, the majority of whom </p><p>are Sunni.  The level of religious observance varies </p><p>throughout the country, in part due to the "secularist" </p><p>approach of the Turkish State.  In addition to the country\'s </p><p>Sunni Muslim majority, there are an estimated 10 -12 million </p><p>Alevis, followers of a belief system based on Islam with a </p><p>coloration related to aspects of Shi\'ism and influenced by </p><p>other religions found in Anatolia. Turkish Alevi rituals </p><p>include men and women worshipping together through speeches, </p><p>poetry, and dance.   The Government considers Alevism a </p><p>heterodox Muslim sect; however, some Turkish Alevis and </p><p>radical Sunnis maintain Alevis are not Muslims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. There are several other religious groups, mostly </p><p>concentrated in Istanbul and other large cities.  While exact </p><p>membership figures are not available, these include an </p><p>estimated 65,000  Armenian Orthodox Christians, 25,000 Jews, </p><p>and from 3,000 to 5,000 Greek Orthodox.  These three groups </p><p>are recognized by the Government as having special legal </p><p>minority status under the 1923 Lausanne Treaty.  There also </p><p>are approximately 10,000 Baha\'is, as well as an estimated </p><p>15,000 Syrian Orthodox (Syriac) Christians, 3,000 </p><p>Protestants, and small, undetermined numbers of Bulgarian, </p><p>Chaldean, Nestorian, Georgian, Roman Catholic, and Maronite </p><p>Christians.  The number of Syriac Christians in the southeast </p><p>once was high; however, under pressure from State authorities </p><p>and later under the impact of the war against the PKK </p><p>insurrection many Syriacs have migrated to Istanbul, Europe, </p><p>or North America. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. There are no known estimates of the number and religious </p><p>affiliation of foreign missionaries in the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>SECTION II. STATUS OF RELIGIOIUS FREEDOM: </p><p>Legal/Policy Framework </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the </p><p>Government generally respects this right in practice; </p><p>however, the Government imposes some restrictions on </p><p>non-Muslim religious groups and on Muslim religious </p><p>expression in government offices and state-run institutions, </p><p>including universities, usually for the stated reason of </p><p>combating religious fundamentalism.  The Constitution </p><p>establishes the country as a secular state and provides for </p><p>freedom of belief, freedom of worship, and the private </p><p>dissemination of religious ideas.  However, these rights are </p><p>restricted particularly by other constitutional provisions </p><p>regarding the integrity and existence of the secular State. </p><p>The Constitution prohibits discrimination on religious </p><p>grounds. </p><p>10. The Government oversees Muslim religious facilities and </p><p>education through its Directorate of Religious Affairs </p><p>(Diyanet).  It regulates the operation of the country\'s </p><p>75,000 mosques, and employs local and provincial imams, who </p><p>are civil servants.  Some groups claim that the Diyanet </p><p>reflects mainstream Sunni Islamic beliefs to the exclusion of </p><p>other beliefs; however, the Government asserts that the </p><p>Diyanet treats equally all those who request services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. A separate government agency, the General Directorate for </p><p> Foundations (Vakiflar Genel Mudurlugu), regulates some </p><p>activities of non-Muslim religious groups and their </p><p>affiliated churches, monasteries, religious schools, and </p><p>related property.  There are 160 "minority foundations" </p><p>recognized by the Vakiflar, including Greek Orthodox </p><p>(approximately 70 sites), Armenian Orthodox (approximately </p><p>50), and Jewish (20), as well as Syrian Christian, Chaldean, </p><p>Bulgarian Orthodox, Georgian, and Maroni foundations.  The </p><p>Vakiflar also regulates Muslim charitable religious </p><p>foundations, including schools and hospitals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. In October 2002 the Government implemented a reform </p><p>measure allowing, in principle, some non-Muslim foundations </p><p>to acquire property for the first time since 1936. A number </p><p>of foundations criticized the application process as lengthy </p><p>and burdensome, and by the end of the period covered in this </p><p>report the Vakiflar had rejected many such applications. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. Some religious groups have lost property to the State in </p><p>the past, or continue to fight against such losses.  If a </p><p>non-Muslim community does not use its property due to a </p><p>decline in the size of its congregation to under 10 </p><p>individuals, the Vakiflar may assume direct administration </p><p>and ownership.  If such groups can demonstrate a renewed </p><p>community need, they may apply to recover their properties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. Government authorities do not interfere on matters of </p><p>doctrine pertaining to non-Muslim religions, nor do they </p><p>restrict the publication or use of religious literature among </p><p>members of the religion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. There are legal restrictions against insulting any </p><p>religion recognized by the State, interfering with that </p><p>religion\'s services, or debasing its property.  However, some </p><p>Christian churches have been defaced, with communities unable </p><p>to repair them, including in the Tur Abdin area of the </p><p>southeast where many ancient Syriac churches are found. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Alevis freely practice their beliefs and build "Cem </p><p>houses" (places of gathering).  Many Alevis allege </p><p>discrimination in the State\'s failure to include any of their </p><p>doctrines or beliefs in religious instruction classes (which </p><p>reflect Sunni Muslim doctrines) in public schools, and charge </p><p>a bias in the Diyanet.  No funds are allocated specifically </p><p>from the Diyanet budget for Alevi activities or religious </p><p>leadership.  However, some Sunni Islamic political activists </p><p>charge that the secular state favors and is under the </p><p>influence of the Alevis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Restrictions on Religious Freedom </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. The Government imposes some restrictions on religious </p><p>groups and on religious expression in government offices and </p><p>state-run institutions, including universities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. The Government, in particular the military, judiciary, </p><p>and other members of the secular elite, continued to wage </p><p>campaigns against proponents of Islamic fundamentalism. </p><p>Fundamentalism, especially the advocacy of Shari\'a law, is </p><p>viewed by these groups as a threat to the democratic secular </p><p>republic.  The National Security Council (NSC)--a powerful </p><p>military/civilian body established by the 1982 Constitution </p><p>to advise senior leadership on national security </p><p>matters--categorizes religious fundamentalism as a threat to </p><p>public safety.  Despite the NSC\'s activism on this issue, </p><p>legislative measures have been taken in only 5 of an 18-point </p><p>"anti-fundamentalist" plan introduced in 1997. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. According to the human rights NGO Mazlum-Der, some </p><p>government ministries dismissed, or barred from promotion, </p><p>civil servants suspected of anti-state (including Islamist) </p><p>activities, one of the 1997 points.  According to Mazlum-Der, </p><p>other contacts, and media accounts, the military regularly </p><p>dismisses observant Muslims from the service.  Allegedly such </p><p>dismissals are based on behavior that the military believes </p><p>identifies these individuals as Islamic fundamentalists, and </p><p>their fear is that such individuals have less loyalty to a </p><p>secular, democratic state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. In November 2002 an appeals court overturned a February </p><p>2002 ruling by an administrative court to close  the Union of </p><p>Alevi-Bektasi Organizations (ABKB) on the grounds that it </p><p>violated the Associations Law, which prohibits the </p><p>establishment of associations "in the name of any religion, </p><p>race, social class, religion, or sect."  The case was </p><p>returned to the lower court, which ruled against closure in </p><p>February 2003.  An appeals court in May 2003 upheld the lower </p><p>court ruling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. Tarikats (religious orders and communities) and other </p><p>mystical Sunni Islamic, quasi-religious, and social orders </p><p>have been banned officially since the 1920s and the Turkish </p><p>military ranks tarikats among the most pernicious threats to </p><p>Kemalist secularism, but tarikats remain active and </p><p>widespread.  The NSC has called for stricter enforcement of </p><p>the ban as part of its campaign against the perceived threat </p><p>of Islamic fundamentalism.  Nevertheless, some prominent </p><p>political and social leaders continue to be associated with </p><p>tarikats or other Islamic communities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. Under the law, religious services may take place only in </p><p>designated places of worship.  Under municipal codes, only </p><p>the State can designate a place of worship, and if a religion </p><p>has no legal standing in the country it may not be eligible </p><p>for a designated site.  Non-Muslim religious services, </p><p>especially for religious groups that do not own property </p><p>recognized by the Vakiflar, often take place on diplomatic </p><p>property or in private apartments.  Police occasionally bar </p><p>Christians from holding services in private apartments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. An August 2001 circular signed by the Ministry of </p><p>Interior  encouraged some governors to use existing laws </p><p>(such as those which regulate meetings, religious building </p><p>zoning, and education) to regulate gatherings of </p><p>"Protestants, Baha\'is, Jehovah\'s Witnesses, Believers in </p><p>Christ, etc ..." within their provinces, while "bearing in </p><p>mind" those provisions of the law that provide for freedom of </p><p>religion.  According to one Protestant group, as well as </p><p>other observers and media reports, local authorities asked </p><p>more than a dozen churches in Istanbul and elsewhere to </p><p>close, or  subjected them to increased police harassment, </p><p>since the publication of the circular.  Several Protestant </p><p>groups that have engaged in activities ranging from worship, </p><p>to bible study, to religious education have had charges filed </p><p>against them for zoning violations.  There is no known method </p><p>for acquiring zoning to engage in any new religious-building </p><p>construction.  Mosques, churches, and synagogues alike have </p><p>no "zoned" status, and no group is known to have received </p><p>zoning permission for the construction of a "new" church. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. Following the Constitutional Court\'s June 2001 closure of </p><p>the Islamist Fazilet (Virtue) party for being a center of </p><p>activities "contrary to the principle of the secular </p><p>republic," two successor parties were formed--the Islamist </p><p>Saadet (Contentment) Party and the AK (Justice and </p><p>Development) Party, conscious of the strength of Muslim </p><p>tradition in Anatolia but calling itself  a "conservative </p><p>democratic" party.  AK Party Chairman  Recep Tayyip Erdogan, </p><p>now Prime Minister, faced immediate legal challenges to his </p><p>role as founding member of the party, based on his 1999 </p><p>conviction for the crime of "inciting religious hatred."  In </p><p>January 2002, the Constitutional Court ruled that Erdogan was </p><p>ineligible to run for Parliament due to this conviction and </p><p>therefore could not be a founding member of the party, and </p><p>gave  AK an October 2002 deadline to remove Erdogan as party </p><p>chairman.  When AK failed to comply, prosecutors opened a </p><p>case demanding the closure of AK.  The case continued at the </p><p>end of the period covered in this report, though under recent </p><p>legal reforms a conviction would not lead to closure. </p><p>Erdogan also faces possible legal charges based on speeches </p><p>he made in the early 1990s that allegedly contained </p><p>anti-secularist statements, and for alleged financial </p><p>misconduct.  Erdogan was elected to Parliament in </p><p>by-elections held after the term of his political ban </p><p>expired. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. Necmettin Erbakan, an Islamist former Prime Minister, was </p><p>also banned from the November electionsowing to a past </p><p>conviction for illegal speech.  Erbakan assumed the Saadet </p><p>chairmanship in May 2003 after his five-year political ban </p><p>expired. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26. In July 2001, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) </p><p>upheld the Government\'s 1998 decision to close Fazilet\'s </p><p>predecessor party, Refah.  The court ruled that the closure </p><p>"could reasonably be considered to meet a pressing social </p><p>need for the protection of a democratic society" because, </p><p>according to the ECHR\'s analysis, Refah had espoused the </p><p>possibility of instituting Shari\'a law in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. In March 2003, an Ankara State Security Court ruled to </p><p>postpone a verdict in the trial in absentia of controversial </p><p>Islamic philosopher Fetullah Gulen, now residing in the </p><p>United States.  Gulen, indicted in 2000, faced five to 10 </p><p>years imprisonment under the Anti-Terror Law on charges of </p><p>"attempting to change the characteristics of the Republic" by </p><p> trying to establish a theocratic Islamic state.  The </p><p>prosecutor also charged that Gulen attempted to "infiltrate" </p><p>the military.  Under the postponement ruling, the case </p><p>against Gulen will be formally closed if he does not commit </p><p>another felony crime within five years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28. The authorities monitor the activities of Eastern </p><p>Orthodox churches but do not interfere with their activities. </p><p> The Government does not recognize the ecumenical nature of </p><p>the Greek Orthodox patriarch, acknowledging him only as head </p><p>of the Turkish Greek Orthodox community.  The Government does </p><p>not interfere with his travels or other ecumenical </p><p>activities, however.  The Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul </p><p>continues to seek to reopen the Halki seminary on the island </p><p>of Heybeli in the Sea of Marmara.  The seminary has been </p><p>closed since 1971, when the State nationalized all private </p><p>institutions of higher learning.  Under existing </p><p>restrictions, religious communities largely remain unable to </p><p>train new clergy in the country for eventual leadership. </p><p>Coreligionists from outside the country have been permitted </p><p>to assume leadership positions in some cases, but all </p><p>community leaders (Patriarchs and Chief Rabbis) must be </p><p>Turkish citizens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29. There is no law that explicitly prohibits proselytizing </p><p>or religious conversions; however, many prosecutors and </p><p>police regard proselytizing and religious activism with </p><p>suspicion, especially when such activities are deemed to have </p><p>political overtones.  Police occasionally bar Christians from </p><p>proselytizing by handing out literature.  Police occasionally </p><p>arrest proselytizers for disturbing the peace, "insulting </p><p>Islam," conducting unauthorized educational courses, or </p><p>distributing literature that has criminal or separatist </p><p>elements.  Courts usually dismiss such charges.  If the </p><p>proselytizers are foreigners, they may be deported, but </p><p>generally they are able to reenter the country.  Police </p><p>officers may report students who meet with Christian </p><p>missionaries to their families or to university authorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>30. The Government continued to enforce a long-term ban on </p><p>the wearing of religious head coverings at universities or by </p><p>civil servants in public buildings.  Women who wear head </p><p>coverings, and both men and women who actively show support </p><p>for those who defy the ban, have been disciplined or lost </p><p>their jobs in the public sector as nurses and teachers. </p><p>Students who wear head coverings are not permitted to </p><p>register for classes.  In March 2002, deputies from Islamist </p><p>parties in Parliament pressed for a motion of censure against </p><p>the Minister of Education for allegedly "creating unrest at </p><p>the ministry" and "escalating tensions" by enforcing strictly </p><p>the headscarf ban, including at Imam-Hatip (religious) high </p><p>schools.  In June 2002, a special parliamentary committee </p><p>concluded that the Minister should not face charges.  Many </p><p>secular Turkish women accuse Islamists of using the headscarf </p><p>as a political tool, and say they fear that efforts to remove </p><p>the headscarf ban will lead to pressure against women who </p><p>choose not to wear head covering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>31. In April 2003, the President, the chief of the Turkish </p><p>General Staff, opposition party members, and high-ranking </p><p>bureaucrats boycotted a reception in honor of Turkey,s </p><p>national children,s holiday because Parliament Speaker </p><p>Bulent Arinc,s wife, who wears a headscarf, was listed on </p><p>the invitation as co-host.  The incident marked the first </p><p>time the event had been boycotted in 83 years.  Arinc also </p><p>drew sharp criticism from secular circles in November 2002 </p><p>for bringing his wife with him to the airport to see off </p><p>President Sezer on a foreign trip. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>32. Some members of non-Muslim religious groups claim that </p><p>they have limited career prospects in government or military </p><p>service, particularly as military officers, judges or </p><p>prosecutors.  A 1997 law made eight  years of secular </p><p>education compulsory.  Students may pursue study at Islamic </p><p>Imam-Hatip high schools upon completion of eight  years in </p><p>the secular public schools.  Imam-Hatip schools are </p><p>classified as vocational, and therefore graduates face some </p><p>barriers to university admission such as an automatic </p><p>reduction in their entrance exam grades.  Only the Diyanet is </p><p>authorized to provide religious training, usually through the </p><p>public schools, although some clandestine private religious </p><p>classes may exist.  Students who complete five years of </p><p>primary school may enroll in Diyanet Koran classes on </p><p>weekends and during summer vacation.  Many Koran courses </p><p>function unofficially. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>33. State-sponsored Islamic religious and moral instruction </p><p>in public eight-year primary schools is compulsory.  Upon </p><p>written verification of their non-Muslim background, </p><p>minorities "recognized" by the Government under the 1923 </p><p>Lausanne Treaty (Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and </p><p>Jewish) are exempted by law from Muslim religious </p><p>instruction.  These students may attend courses with parental </p><p>consent.  Other non-Muslim minorities, such as Catholics, </p><p>Protestants, and Syriac Christians, are not exempted legally; </p><p>however, in practice they may obtain exemptions.  The courts </p><p>have ruled that all universities are public institutions and, </p><p>as such, have an obligation to protect the country\'s basic </p><p>principles, such as secularism.  Small, peaceful protests </p><p>against this policy occurred at various times during the </p><p>period covered by this report, and some journalists and </p><p>supporters face minor charges relating to their roles in the </p><p>protests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>34. Some religious groups have lost property to the State in </p><p>the past, or continue to fight against such losses. An </p><p>Armenian church in Kirikhan, Hatay province, faced possible </p><p>expropriation when  its community  decreased to fewer than 10 </p><p>persons.  The Armenian Patriarchate won a court case allowing </p><p>it  to retain control of the property, but prosecutors </p><p>appealed.  In April 2003 an appeals court upheld the original </p><p>ruling and ordered the property to be turned over to an </p><p>Armenian church board. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>35. In April 2002 the Baha\'i community lost a legal appeal </p><p>against government expropriation of a sacred site in Edirne. </p><p>The Ministry of Culture had granted cultural heritage status </p><p>to the site in 1993, but in January 2000 the Ministry of </p><p>Education notified the Baha\'i community that it had </p><p>expropriated the adjacent primary school property for future </p><p>use.  At the end of the period covered in this report, the </p><p>Baha,i were awaiting the results of their final appeal to </p><p>the Council of State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>36. Restoration or construction may be carried out in </p><p>buildings and monuments considered "ancient" only with </p><p>authorization of the regional board on the protection of </p><p>cultural and national wealth.  Bureaucratic procedures and </p><p>considerations relating to historic preservation in the past </p><p>have impeded repairs to religious facilities, especially in </p><p>the Syrian Orthodox and Armenian properties.  However, </p><p>according to religious leaders, the Government has become </p><p>more supportive of these communities\' requests.  Groups are </p><p>prohibited from using funds from their properties in one part </p><p>of the country from supporting their existing population in </p><p>another part of the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>37. Although religious affiliation is listed on national </p><p>identity cards, there is no official discrimination based </p><p>upon religious persuasion.  Some religious groups, such as </p><p>the Baha\'i, allege that they are not permitted to state their </p><p>religion on their cards because no category exists; they have </p><p>made their concerns known to the Government.  Conversion to </p><p>another religion entails amending one\'s identification card; </p><p>there are reports that those who convert from Islam to </p><p>another religion have been subject to harassment by local </p><p>officials when they seek amendment of their cards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Abuses of Religious Freedom </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>38. U.S. citizen and Sufi Muslim preacher Aydogan Fuat was </p><p>released following his May 2002 acquittal on charges of </p><p>illegally using religious dress.  Prosecutors appealed </p><p>Fuat,s acquittal, but the appeals court did not respond. </p><p>Fuat was also acquitted on separate charges of causing </p><p>religious enmity through speech. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>39. Christian groups have encountered difficulty in </p><p>organizing (especially in university settings) in Gaziantep, </p><p>Eskisehir, and other cities in which they have not sought </p><p>recognition as a foundation; the authorities briefly detained </p><p>some Turkish and foreign Christians in these areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>40. In March 2003 an Istanbul court acquitted seven </p><p>Christians who were charged with holding illegal church and </p><p>Bible study meetings in an apartment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>41. In June 2003, an Istanbul court acquitted  13  Ahmadi </p><p>Muslims, members of a small religious community , who had </p><p>been  arrested in April 2002 and charged under Article 7 of </p><p>the Anti-Terror Law (involvement with an organization "with </p><p>terrorist aims").  Three of the defendants had been held </p><p>until their August 2002 hearing, after which they were </p><p>released on bail.  The case was under appeal at the end of </p><p>the period covered in this report. </p><p>There were no other reports of religious detainees or </p><p>prisoners. </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Forced Religious Conversion </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>42. There were no reports of forced religious conversion, </p><p>including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or </p><p>illegally removed from the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Improvements and Positive Developments </p><p>in Respect for Religious Freedom </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>43. In October 2002 the Government implemented a reform </p><p>measure allowing, in principle, some non-Muslim foundations </p><p>to acquire property for the first time since 1936.  A number </p><p>of foundations criticized the application process as lengthy </p><p>and burdensome, and by the end of the period covered in this </p><p>report the Vakiflar had rejected many such applications. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>44. In June 2003, Parliament approved an amendment to the Act </p><p>on Construction replacing the word "mosques" with "houses of </p><p>worship," removing a legal obstacle to the building of </p><p>non-Muslim religious facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>45. In May 2002, the Diyanet adopted a series of decisions </p><p>after holding a 4-day conference on religious issues with </p><p>attendees from the Diyanet\'s Supreme Council on Religious </p><p>Issues and experts from theology schools.  The Diyanet </p><p>formally decided to: allow women to participate in the </p><p>congregation for daily prayers on Fridays, during religious </p><p>holidays, and funeral prayers; allow original Arabic prayers </p><p>to be recited in native tongues; rule that men may not use </p><p>the Koran as a premise for domestic violence; underline the </p><p>fact that civil marriages (rather than religious marriages) </p><p>are required by law; and state that social and legal advances </p><p>for women are not against the spirit of the Koran.  Some </p><p>women immediately began to participate in congregations with </p><p>men. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>46. In the fall of 2001, the Diyanet issued an immediate </p><p>statement condemning terrorism as a crime against humanity. </p><p>The Diyanet also issued a statement, read during Friday </p><p>prayers at all mosques, stressing that there is no Islamic </p><p>justification for any form of terrorism.  This message was </p><p>reinforced during the Ramazan period at state-sponsored </p><p>Iftaar dinners attended by members of non-Muslim religious </p><p>groups, and repeated in a statement at the Diyanet-sponsored </p><p>"Fifth Eurasia Islamic Council." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>SECTION III. SOCIETAL ATTITUDES </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>47. Government policy and the generally calm relationship </p><p>among religions in society contributed to religious freedom; </p><p>however, some Muslims, Christians, and Baha\'is face societal </p><p>suspicion and mistrust.  Jews and most Christian </p><p>denominations freely practice their religions and report </p><p>little discrimination in daily life.  However, citizens who </p><p>convert from Islam may experience some form of social </p><p>harassment or pressure from family and neighbors. </p><p>Proselytizing is socially  unacceptable.  A variety of </p><p>newspapers and television shows have published anti-Christian </p><p>messages, including leftist-nationalist"Aydinlik", whichin </p><p>May 2002 published a purported list of 40 churches in the </p><p>city of Izmir that were "bribing" converts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>48. Many non-Muslim religious group members, along with many </p><p>in the secular political majority of Muslims, fear the </p><p>possibility of Islamic extremism and the involvement of even </p><p>moderate Islam in politics.  Several Islamist newspapers </p><p>regularly publish anti-Semitic material. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>49. Iftar dinners (evening events tied to the daily breaking </p><p>of the Ramadan fast) often involve invitations to non-Muslim </p><p>religious and secular leaders.  Iftars hosted by diplomats, </p><p>as well as business and religious leaders, typically include </p><p>invitations to non-Muslims as a sign of openness and </p><p>hospitality. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>SECTION IV. U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>50. The U.S. Government discusses religious freedom issues </p><p>with the Government in the context of its overall dialog and </p><p>policy of promoting human rights.  The Ambassador and other </p><p>Mission officials, including staff of the U.S. Consulate </p><p>General in Istanbul and the U.S. Consulate in Adana, enjoy </p><p>close relations with Muslim majority and other religious </p><p>groups.  The U.S. Embassy continues to urge the Government to </p><p>re-open the Halki seminary on Heybeli Island.  In December </p><p>2001, the Secretary of State met with high-ranking government </p><p>officials to discuss several issues, including freedom of </p><p>religion.  In April and May 2002, visiting representatives </p><p>from the State Department\'s Bureau of Democracy, Human </p><p>Rights, and Labor met with members of various religious </p><p>groups to hear their concerns.  In October 2002 the Archons </p><p>of the Order of St. Andrew, an American group which actively </p><p>supports the Ecumenical Patriarchate, made its first trip to </p><p>Ankara and, with the support of the Embassy, met with the </p><p>Diyanet and other senior officials to urge the reopening of </p><p>Halki.  The Ambassador and other Embassy officers also remain </p><p>in close contact with local NGOs that monitor freedom of </p><p>religion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>51. Embassy and Consulate staff members monitor and report on </p><p>incidents of detention of foreigners found proselytizing, and </p><p>have attended the trials of Americans and others facing </p><p>charges relating to free expression and the free practice of </p><p>religion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
