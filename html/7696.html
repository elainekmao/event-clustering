<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000888 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/24/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: YORUBA CONTROL OF SOUTHWEST POLITICS A </p><p>THING OF THE PAST? </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ACTING CONSUL GENERAL JOSEPH GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary.  Ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) </p><p>sweeps in recent legislative and gubernatorial elections show </p><p>that rule of "old line" leaders of the mainly-Yoruba Alliance </p><p>for Democracy Party and the Yoruba socio-cultural </p><p>organization, Afenifere, has ended.  Five of the six States </p><p>in the southwest have gone to PDP and a younger group of </p><p>politicians.  This may signal a more progressive governance </p><p>in the region, at least for the near term.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Licking the wounds </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Leaders of the largely-Yoruba Alliance for Democracy </p><p>Party (AD) and the Yoruba socio-cultural organization, </p><p>Afenifere, met four days after the April 19 presidential and </p><p>gubernatorial elections to try to muddle together a position </p><p>in the face of the AD\'s astonishing defeat in five of the six </p><p>southwestern States they had controlled since the elections </p><p>of 1999.  The group issued a resolution rejecting the </p><p>election results but stopped short of threats of court </p><p>challenges that other politicians have made.  Instead, they </p><p>stated that the validity of the elections and the </p><p>determination of the rightful winner would be left to the </p><p>"tribunal of God and the court of public opinion."  The </p><p>resolution also rejected reports that AD National Chairman </p><p>Ahmed Abdulkadri had officially conceded a presidential </p><p>victory to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate and </p><p>current President, Olusegun Obasanjo.  Trying to find someone </p><p>to blame for the debacle, an AD source told PolOffs that some </p><p>in the group accused Abdulkadri of being in cahoots with the </p><p>PDP to the detriment and destruction of the AD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  AD and Afenifere have given the media a list of </p><p>alleged irregularities in the  April 12 legislative elections </p><p>and the April 19 gubernatorial elections.  (AD did not field </p><p>a presidential candidate, and thus, has no standing to </p><p>challenge that election.)  The leaders of the two groups were </p><p>to have met again on April 24th to consider what action they </p><p>will take with respect to this matter, but sources have told </p><p>PolOffs that the decision is unlikely to contradict the </p><p>decision already taken, i. e. not to challenge the elections </p><p>in court.  Ironically, the PDP is apparently going after the </p><p>one southwestern State it did not capture, Lagos State.  The </p><p>losing candidate, Funso Williams (PDP), has submitted a </p><p>petition charging gross irregularities in the gubernatorial </p><p>election that went to AD Governor Bola Tinubu.  Although some </p><p>irregularities were reported by all elections observers, </p><p>there appears to be little chance that Williams\' challenge </p><p>will succeed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What happened and what\'s next? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Consulate sources and most media observers blame the </p><p>AD and Afenifere current troubles on complacency.  Since the </p><p>First Republic, AD (evolving from the Yoruba base in </p><p>predecessor organization like the United Party of Nigeria and </p><p>the Social Democratic Party) and Afenifere had an easy time </p><p>of marshaling support of the Yoruba in the southwest.  This </p><p>was so much so that many observers still refer to the region </p><p>as the "monolithic" southwest.  However, beginning with the </p><p>elections of 1999, leaders of the group apparently became </p><p>over-confident and began to neglect the constant care and </p><p>feeding necessary to sustain a loyal constituency.  Added to </p><p>this, Afenifere began to try to reshape itself as a political </p><p>organization, if not superior to AD, then at least AD\'s equal </p><p>in demanding Yoruba loyalty.  Obansanjo, a Yoruba and PDP </p><p>candidate, won neither the hearts nor the votes of Yorubas in </p><p>the southwest and got no support from Afenifere in 1999.  As </p><p>a consequence, he is reportedly behind the formation of the </p><p>Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) in 2001.  The YCE, widely </p><p>regarded as the tool of Obasanjo, publicly eschews any </p><p>political aspirations and claims its focus is only </p><p>"socio-cultural." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  An aide to Governor Tinubu told PolOff that leaders </p><p>of AD would be meeting during the next months to shape a "new </p><p>AD" and a "new Deal" for the Yoruba.  With five of the </p><p>governors in the southwest heavily financed, solidly backed </p><p>by the majority party and ready to make names for themselves </p><p>and their party, AD will have a difficult road ahead.  Media </p><p>observers have commented that the new bloc of young Yoruba </p><p>governors will no longer be directed by the "politics of </p><p>gerontocratics" of the old leaders of any political party and </p><p>Afenifere has lost its influence over this generation of </p><p>political leaders.  Some observers have pointed to the </p><p>assassination of Justice Minister Chief Bola Ige, a strong </p><p>opponent of Afenifere\'s mixing in politics, as the point </p><p>where Yorubas began to lose faith in both the AD and </p><p>Afenifere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State by State </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu was always expected </p><p>to be retained in office.  Despite grumbling from some losing </p><p>candidates, Tinubu has already begun to consolidate his win </p><p>by accepting congratulations from opponents and beginning to </p><p>pay off campaign debts.  In Ondo State age, in the person of </p><p>incumbent Adebayo Adefarati, bowed to the relative youth of </p><p>PDP candidate Dr. Oluegun Agagu.  Although, Adefarati had </p><p>made no statement rejecting or accepting defeat to date, </p><p>Agagu has already published a victory message and solicited </p><p>"suggestions from the people to improve the State."  Chief </p><p>Bisi Akande, in Osun State is apparently the only loser to </p><p>step aside gracefully.  One day after Prince Olagunsoye </p><p>Oyinlola (PDP) was declared the winner, Akande set up a </p><p>seventeen member transition team to handle the turn-over to </p><p>his successor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The biggest surprise upset came in Ogun State where </p><p>Governor Olusegun Osoba was unseated by Otunba Gbenga Daniel. </p><p> Osoba was expected to win re-election because he had turned </p><p>in the best performance of any of the southwest governors </p><p>except Tinubu.  He was  described by observers as a superb </p><p>politician campaigning tirelessly across the State and </p><p>drawing large enthusiastic crowds.  He was also reported to </p><p>have the support of the traditional rulers in Ogun.  However, </p><p>as soon as Daniel was declared the winner and President </p><p>Obasanjo sent a congratulatory message, the traditional </p><p>rulers hurried to congratulate Daniel, too, and urge the </p><p>loser to "accept defeat in good faith and the spirit of </p><p>sportsmanship." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  After the April 12 legislative elections showed PDP </p><p>making big inroads into AD\'s southwest power base, many </p><p>projected that of the six vulnerable governors, Lamidi </p><p>Adesina of Oyo State would most certainly lose his job. </p><p>Adesina had lost support of the Oyo citizens by failure to </p><p>deliver government services, alienating local leaders, and </p><p>lavishing government money and jobs on his friends and </p><p>family.  As predicted, Adesina lost to rival Senator Rasheed </p><p>Ladoja of the PDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Following the April 12 legislative loses, Governor </p><p>Niyi Adebyo, charged out with renewed vigor to wage a </p><p>week-long, door-to-door campaign to save his seat in tiny </p><p>Eketi State.  Although a close race down to the finish, </p><p>Adeboyo lost to PDP\'s Peter Ayo Fayose.  There has been no </p><p>word from either camp on whether the election will be </p><p>challenged or accepted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Comment.  Nigerian voters in this series of </p><p>elections appeared to be more enthusiastic about their </p><p>ability to affect government by their votes.  Political </p><p>parties, especially the AD, were taken by surprise that </p><p>voters would not only complain about bad government but come </p><p>out in significant numbers and stand in the hot sun or </p><p>driving rain to vote to make changes in their leadership. </p><p>The new governors and legislators now have four years to </p><p>prove that the voters were right to trust democracy, and the </p><p>voters have four years to see that they can have change if </p><p>the new leaders fail to deliver.  AD and Afenifere leaders </p><p>seem to have rejected, however, any notion that their ousting </p><p>from southwest seats of power had any direct link to voter </p><p>preference.  They claim that fraud alone explains their poor </p><p>showing in the elections. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
