<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000800 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KCRM, SNAR, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON), Nepali Government Policy </p><p>SUBJECT: Parliament Adjourns With Passage of Anti- </p><p>Corruption Bills </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 555 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Parliament adjourned April 17 after </p><p>passing four anti-corruption bills.  Legislators will </p><p>return in May for a budget session and to consider further </p><p>extending the state of emergency in effect since November </p><p>2001.  The four new anti-corruption measures provide for </p><p>punishments for taking bribes and other public </p><p>malfeasance; the means to freeze accounts of officials </p><p>accused of corruption; the establishment of a special </p><p>court to prosecute corruption cases; and the impeachment </p><p>of members of constitutional bodies.  Reformers welcomed </p><p>the new measures, but warned of obstacles to </p><p>implementation and vague language that could handicap the </p><p>measures\' effectiveness.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal\'s Parliament Adjourns </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Nepal\'s Parliament adjourned its winter session </p><p>April 17, its last order of business the passage of four </p><p>bills targeted against public corruption.  Parliament will </p><p>re-convene for a budget session in mid-May, in time for </p><p>legislators to consider an extension of the state of </p><p>emergency.  [Note: The state of emergency expires May 26, </p><p>and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has indicated that </p><p>he will ask Parliament to extend it.  Originally declared </p><p>November 26, 2001, the emergency was extended by three </p><p>months in late February by vote of Parliament.  The </p><p>Parliament Secretariat told us that this year the </p><p>government had decided to move up by one month </p><p>Parliament\'s annual budget session, which usually convenes </p><p>in June.  This will obviate the need to convene a special </p><p>session to extend the emergency.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Anti-Corruption Bill Locus of New Measures </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) At the heart of the package of four new public </p><p>corruption measures is the "Anti-Corruption Bill," which </p><p>provides for punishments for accepting or giving bribes </p><p>and acquiring property with illegally-acquired funds. </p><p>Jail terms range from three months for accepting a bribe </p><p>worth Nepali Rupees (NRs.) 25 thousand (USD 325) to up to </p><p>ten years for a bribe of over NRs. 10 million (USD </p><p>130,000).  The bill would forbid civil servants from </p><p>taking "donations" or gifts related to work without </p><p>permission, keeping commissions or other benefits gained </p><p>in the course of procuring or leasing goods and services, </p><p>and inflicting loss or damage to public property. </p><p> </p><p>CIAA: Power to Freeze Accounts </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) A second bill grants additional powers to the </p><p>Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority </p><p>(CIAA).  The CIAA would have the power to issue orders to </p><p>freeze bank accounts belonging to individuals under </p><p>investigation for corruption, and to seize property </p><p>acquired through illegal means even though the property is </p><p>in someone else\'s name.  Public officials would be </p><p>required to prepare and submit financial disclosure </p><p>statements or face penalties.  The statements would be </p><p>consulted in the future to gauge whether an official has </p><p>acquired property illegally or had been living beyond his </p><p>means. </p><p> </p><p>Another Special Court </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The fourth anti-corruption measure provides for the </p><p>establishment of a Special Court to hear corruption cases. </p><p>[Note:  Nepal\'s legislature has already mandated special </p><p>courts to hear cases related to narcotics trafficking, </p><p>trafficking in persons (TIP), and public security.  These </p><p>special courts are located in Kathmandu, but take cases </p><p>from all over the country.  NGOs working on TIP issues </p><p>have complained that many victims of trafficking cannot </p><p>afford the expense of traveling to the capital to make </p><p>their case, and for that reason some traffickers have </p><p>escaped prosecution.  End Note.]  The Special Court can </p><p>freeze the assets and hold the passports of accused </p><p>persons.  Appeals from the Special Court go directly to </p><p>the Supreme Court.  [Note:  Previously, corruption cases </p><p>were first heard in Appellate Court.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>New Impeachment Mechanism </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) An Impeachment Bill establishes a mechanism for </p><p>Parliament to impeach officials of constitutional bodies </p><p>for inefficiency, "bad character," or dishonesty.  [Note: </p><p>Constitutional bodies include the Election and Public </p><p>Service Commissions as well as the Commission for the </p><p>Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).  Previously </p><p>Parliament lacked the means to remove members of these </p><p>bodies for cause.  End Note.]  The bill would require a </p><p>vote of twenty-five percent of Parliament to commence an </p><p>impeachment proceeding.  A panel of three - two MPs (from </p><p>different parties) and a legal expert - would then take </p><p>statements and conduct an investigation before making a </p><p>recommendation to the full house.  The full chamber votes </p><p>on the panel\'s recommendation, with a simple majority of </p><p>MPs needed for impeachment. </p><p> </p><p>New Measures Seen as Over-broad, but Amendments Fail </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) A leading Nepalese businessman and member of </p><p>Parliament\'s Upper House criticized the new measures in a </p><p>discussion with Poloff.  In part, problems with the bills </p><p>resulted from the extraordinary treatment they were given. </p><p>All four by-passed regular procedures and were pushed </p><p>through the entire process in a single week, an </p><p>unprecedented occurrence.  Our contact explained that </p><p>although the laws had a "high-sounding name," their scope </p><p>was so broad as to render them meaningless.  By expanding </p><p>the definition of civil servants, the bills would make a </p><p>crime of tipping a waiter in a restaurant partially owned </p><p>by the government.  His greatest fear, however, was that </p><p>by expanding the powers of the CIAA, the new legislation </p><p>would make that body even less effective than it has been. </p><p>The Parliamentarian introduced amendments to redress these </p><p>problems, and although the Upper House accepted the </p><p>amendments, the Lower House voted them down. </p><p> </p><p>Laws and Sausages </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The amendments failed in the Lower House after </p><p>the ruling Nepali Congress Party (NCP) whip, who had a </p><p>large part in pushing through the original, non-amended </p><p>versions of the bills, took the Upper House amendments as </p><p>a personal affront.  While NCP members were working on a </p><p>compromise to ease his wounded pride, opposition leader </p><p>Madhav Nepal took the floor to fight the amendments. </p><p>Nepal argued that after a multi-party consensus on </p><p>fighting corruption had been forged in the Lower House, </p><p>the Upper House had come along and substantially changed </p><p>the legislation.  Nepal proposed rejecting the amendments </p><p>in toto, and in the face of resistance from the whip and </p><p>the opposition party, the rest of the Lower House fell in </p><p>line. </p><p> </p><p>Implementation Uncertain </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Ruling party MPs praised the session\'s </p><p>accomplishments, which also included new legislation on </p><p>women\'s property rights (Reftel) and the establishment of </p><p>commissions on women\'s and dalits\' (lower caste) issues. </p><p>Altogether sixteen bills - including the four anti- </p><p>corruption measures - have been sent to the Palace and </p><p>await formal Royal assent, required for a bill to become </p><p>law under Nepal\'s Constitution.  Observers commented that </p><p>although the new measures are welcome, the test will come </p><p>when the government attempts to implement them.  This is </p><p>especially true of the anti-corruption measures, the Amcit </p><p>head of the local National Democratic Institute (NDI) </p><p>related. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Widely viewed as corrupt and unresponsive, </p><p>Nepal\'s political leaders know they have to put their </p><p>house in order.  In this year\'s Parliamentary session they </p><p>made a tentative effort in that direction.  Although far </p><p>from perfect, the new anti-corruption measures are a good </p><p>start to rolling back a problem that affects both Nepal\'s </p><p>economy and its ability to rally support for efforts to </p><p>quell the Maoist insurgency.  The best reason to celebrate </p><p>may be that the quantity of legislation pushed through </p><p>during this year\'s session of Parliament greatly exceeded </p><p>the output last year - when opposition party leaders led a </p><p>boycott to protest then-Prime Minister G.P. Koirala\'s </p><p>alleged involvement in an airplane-leasing scandal.  Anti- </p><p>corruption crusaders have committed to fighting for more </p><p>and better legal and regulatory tools to press their </p><p>cause, which they rightly view as central to the </p><p>development of Nepal\'s young democracy. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
