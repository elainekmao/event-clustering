<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000554 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PRO-GOVERNMENT DAILY FAULTS ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>CONTINUED SUSPENSION FROM COMMONWEALTH </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Stayaways and sanctions will not </p><p>      solve our problems" the pro-government daily "The </p><p>      Daily Mirror" offered a March 18 editorial criticizing </p><p>      the Commonwealth for extending Zimbabwe\'s suspension, </p><p>      saying the move was "unwise" and "also dampens </p><p>      homegrown efforts to find a solution to our problems." </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The announcement by the Commonwealth Secretary </p><p>      General, Don McKinnon yesterday that the </p><p>      Commonwealth was renewing sanctions (sic) </p><p>      against Zimbabwe came as a shock to many.  The </p><p>      decision seems to have been taken without </p><p>      consensus of African members of the </p><p>      Commonwealth, raising serious doubts about its </p><p>      validity.  Although the hostility of white </p><p>      members of this group towards Zimbabwe, and </p><p>      President Mugabe in particular, is well known, </p><p>      this harsh measure was, without doubt, unwise. </p><p>      Not only does it go against the spirit of </p><p>      political reconciliation, which various eminent </p><p>      personalities from around the world have been </p><p>      trying to foster.  It also dampens homegrown </p><p>      efforts to find a solution to our problems. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
