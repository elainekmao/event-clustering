<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000117 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, SOCI, ETRD, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: HCMC OFFICIALS CAN NOW RUN THE CITY </p><p> </p><p>REF: HO CHI MINH CITY 75 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A TEST CASE FOR </p><p>VIETNAM\'S MAJOR CITIES, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>DEVOLVED SOME SIGNIFICANT POWERS TO HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>WITH THE ISSUANCE OF "DECREE 93" BY THE OFFICE OF THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER.  THIS DECREE PERMITS HCMC FOR THE FIRST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00117  01 OF 02  050818Z </p><p>TIME TO DO ITS OWN BUDGETING, APPROVE LARGE DOMESTIC </p><p>INVESTMENT PROJECTS, HANDLE LAND ISSUES, HIRE AND FIRE </p><p>KEY PERSONNEL, AND EVEN PRIVATIZE SOME PUBLIC SERVICES </p><p>- ALL WITH MUCH LESS INTERFERENCE FROM HANOI.  HCMC </p><p>AUTHORITIES SAY THEY WERE SURPRISED THAT SO MUCH </p><p>AUTONOMY HAS BEEN GRANTED AND ARE STILL ASSESSING </p><p>EXACTLY WHAT THIS MEANS.  THEY ASSERT, HOWEVER, IT WILL </p><p>BRING MORE EFFICIENT, TRANSPARENT, AND RESPONSIVE </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>I NEED TO CHECK WITH HANOI </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>2. HO CHI MINH CITY AUTHORITIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY </p><p>NEEDED APPROVALS FROM HANOI TO MAKE ALMOST ANY MAJOR </p><p>DECISION.  THIS BEGAN TO CHANGE WHEN LAST DECEMBER THE </p><p>OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER ISSUED "DECREE 93." THE </p><p>DECREE GRANTS SIGNIFICANT AUTONOMY TO HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>IN SOME AREAS.  CITY OFFICIALS HAD BEEN PUSHING FOR </p><p>MORE LOCAL CONTROL FOR SOME TIME, BUT TO THEIR </p><p>SURPRISE, ACCORDING TO ONE LOCAL OFFICIAL, "WE GOT </p><p>ABOUT 95% OF WHAT WE WERE ASKING FOR."  ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>DECREE WENT INTO EFFECT ON DECEMBER 27, THE CITY IS </p><p>STILL ASSESSING HOW IT WILL IMPLEMENT ITS NEW POWERS. </p><p>RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS WILL BE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO </p><p>THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH FOR NEW </p><p>IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS.  JUST THE SAME, LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS ALREADY SEE THIS AS A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN </p><p>THE AREA OF ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>YOU\'RE FIRED </p><p>------------ </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00117  01 OF 02  050818Z </p><p>3.  UNDER THE DECREE, THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE OF HCMC </p><p>NOW HAS THE AUTHORITY TO HIRE AND FIRE KEY PERSONNEL, </p><p>SUCH AS CITY DEPARTMENT HEADS.  BEFORE, SUCH DECISIONS </p><p>HAD TO BE APPROVED BY HANOI.  NOW HCMC CAN INSTALL ITS </p><p>OWN PEOPLE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HIERARCHY -- AND </p><p>FIRE THEM IF THEY DO NOT PERFORM.  THE CITY ALSO HAS </p><p>NEW AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL "INCENTIVES" TO </p><p>RECRUIT AND RETAIN SPECIALIZED OR TECHNICAL STAFF. </p><p>FIRST VICE-CHAIRMAN NHAN HAS TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT </p><p>HE WILL USE THESE INCENTIVES TO PROVIDE HIGHER SALARIES </p><p>FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS (SEE REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>4.  WHAT MAY HAVE EVEN A LARGER IMPACT, LOCAL OFFICIALS </p><p>NOW WILL HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH, RESTRUCTURE </p><p>OR DISSOLVE AGENCIES, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, AND </p><p>STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES) UNDER THEIR CONTROL. </p><p>THE CITY CAN ALSO EXERCISE THE OPTION OF PRIVATIZING </p><p>SOME OF ITS PUBLIC SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>IT\'S TIME FOR YOU TO MANAGE YOUR OWN BANK ACCOUNT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>5.  PRIOR TO DECREE 93, HANOI DETERMINED HCMC\'S BUDGET </p><p>LINE ITEM BY LINE ITEM.  HCMC WAS UNABLE TO REDEPLOY </p><p>THAT MONEY REGARDLESS OF HOW THE CITY PERCEIVED </p><p>CHANGING LOCAL NEEDS.  NOW HCMC HAS GAINED VIRTUALLY </p><p>FULL CONTROL OVER ITS ENTIRE BUDGET PROCESS. IN THE </p><p>PAST, HANOI DETERMINED ANNUALLY THE CONTRIBUTION THAT </p><p>HCMC MADE TO THE NATIONAL BUDGET, AND EVERY YEAR SAW AN </p><p>INCREASE.  UNDER DECREE 93, THE AMOUNT GOING TO CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT COFFERS WILL BE SET AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL </p><p>INCOME TAX REVENUES ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS, MAKING IT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00117  01 OF 02  050818Z </p><p>POSSIBLE FOR HCMC TO MORE ACCURATELY FORECAST ITS </p><p>FUTURE REVENUES.  FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS HCMC WILL BE </p><p>ABLE TO RETAIN 24% OF ALL CORPORATE AND PERSONAL INCOME </p><p>TAXES RAISED IN THE CITY.  HCMC WILL ALSO BE ALLOWED TO </p><p>SEEK OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING -- SUCH AS ISSUING BONDS </p><p>AND ASSESSING FEES FOR LOCAL SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>I WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING REALLY BIG </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>6.  CITY PLANNING IS NOW, UNDER DECREE 93, ACTUALLY A </p><p>CITY GOVERNMENT FUNCTION.  THE DECREE EXPLICITLY NOTES </p><p>THAT LAND USE ISSUES ARE TO BE HANDLED AT THE CITY </p><p>LEVEL.  THIS MEANS CITY AUTHORITIES CAN NOW LEASE LAND </p><p>PLOTS OF ANY SIZE AND PAY LOCALLY-DETERMINED PRICES FOR </p><p>LAND FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT PROJECTS. </p><p>PREVIOUSLY, ALL LAND DEALS OVER ONE HECTARE REQUIRED </p><p>APPROVAL FROM THE PRIME MINISTER.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS, THIS CHANGE SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY SPEED UP </p><p>THE APPROVAL PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  STILL, THE DECREE STATES THAT HCMC AUTHORITIES </p><p>SHOULD SHARE PROPOSALS WITH RELEVANT CENTRAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>MINISTRIES ON MAJOR CITY PLANNING INITIATIVES.  IF HCMC </p><p>DOES NOT RECEIVE A REPLY WITHIN 30 DAYS, THE INITIATIVE </p><p>IS CONSIDERED APPROVED. THIS IS A MARKED DEPARTURE FROM </p><p>THE TRADITIONAL "UNLESS IT IS EXPLICITLY PERMITTED, IT </p><p>IS NOT ALLOWED" APPROACH UTILIZED BY THE GVN. </p><p> </p><p>I\'LL TAKE YOUR 10 MILLION </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>8.  THE PROCESS OF APPROVING LARGE DOMESTIC INVESTMENTS </p><p>ALSO HAS BEEN STREAMLINED, AND SHOULD ALLOW PROJECTS TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00117  02 OF 02  050818Z </p><p>MOVE MUCH MORE QUICKLY.  WITH DECREE 93, DOMESTIC </p><p>INVESTMENT PROJECTS OVER US$10 MILLION WILL BE REVIEWED </p><p>AT THE "FEASIBILITY STUDY" PHASE BY THE OFFICE OF THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER.  THIS ALLOWS FOR THE APPROVAL OF </p><p>PROJECTS "IN PRINCIPLE" AT AN EARLY STAGE, RATHER THAN </p><p>SUBJECTING EVERY ASPECT OF A FULLY DEVELOPED PROPOSAL </p><p>TO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SCRUTINY.  THE DECREE DOES NOT </p><p>COVER FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ANYTHING ELSE? </p><p>-------------- </p><p>9.  THE MOVE TO GRANT MORE AUTONOMY TO HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>IS A SUCCESS FOR CITY OFFICIALS WHO HAVE LONG LOBBIED </p><p>FOR THESE CHANGES.  THEY HAVE ASSERTED THAT HCMC - </p><p>BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE, LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND </p><p>RATE OF GROWTH - HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGES. </p><p>SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, HANOI AGREED TO ALMOST ALL OF HO </p><p>CHI MINH CITY OFFICIALS\' PROPOSALS.  ONLY A FEW ITEMS </p><p>FROM THEIR INITIAL PROPOSAL WERE REJECTED: ELIMINATION </p><p>OF ONE LAYER OF CITY GOVERNMENT; CREATION OF A SPECIAL </p><p>HCMC TOURIST POLICE FORCE; AND THE FREEDOM TO ESTABLISH </p><p>HCMC-SPECIFIC INVESTMENT AND FINANCE CORPORATIONS. </p><p>(NOTE:  SEVERAL CONSULATES GENERAL IN HCMC--BRITISH, </p><p>GERMAN, SINGAPOREAN, JAPANESE, AND U.S., AMONG OTHERS-- </p><p>HAD URGED THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE TO ESTABLISH A </p><p>SEPARATE TOURIST POLICE, GIVEN RECENT INCREASES IN </p><p>STREET CRIME AND THE DEATH OF A BRITISH TOURIST DURING </p><p>A PURSE-SNATCHING ATTEMPT.  ALTHOUGH DISAPPOINTED THAT </p><p>THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT GRANT HCMC THE FUNDING </p><p>FOR THIS ENDEAVOR, THIS WAS THE FIRST WE HAD HEARD THAT </p><p>HCMC OFFICIALS HAD BEEN PRESSING HANOI TO INCLUDE A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00117  02 OF 02  050818Z </p><p>SEPARATE POLICE FORCE AS PART OF THE OVERALL REFORM </p><p>PACKAGE.) </p><p> </p><p>10. LOCAL OFFICIALS STATE THAT HCMC WILL CONTINUE </p><p>PUSHING FOR THOSE CHANGES AS A PART OF FUTURE REFORMS. </p><p>OVERALL, HOWEVER, HO CHI MINH CITY OFFICIALS WERE </p><p>PLEASED WITH THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION SHOWN BY HANOI. </p><p>THEY VIEW THESE NEW MANAGEMENT POWERS AS REAL, ABSOLUTE </p><p>AND EFFECTUAL.  HO CHI MINH CITY\'S ABILITY TO SUCCEED </p><p>USING THESE NEW MANDATES WILL BE A HARBINGER OF </p><p>INITIATIVES TO COME THROUGHOUT THE REST OF VIETNAM. </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN CONG TAN WAS QUOTED IN THE </p><p>LOCAL PRESS AS STATING, "IF HCMC FULFILLS THE </p><p>DECENTRALIZED TASKS, THE MODEL WILL BE APPLIED NATION- </p><p>WIDE WHEN ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS ARE CONDUCTED IN THE </p><p>FUTURE." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>11.  THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A STRONG STEP IN </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM BY GRANTING HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>POWERS THAT WOULD PROBABLY APPEAR TO MOST OF US AS </p><p>TYPICAL CITY GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS, BUT NOT IN VIETNAM. </p><p>WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, HOWEVER, IS HOW BOTH HANOI AND </p><p>HCMC DEFINE, IN PRACTICE, THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP.  ONE </p><p>CITY OFFICIAL NOTED THAT EVEN WITH ITS NEW POWERS "IN </p><p>REALITY, WE WILL STILL ASK FOR ADVICE FROM HANOI ON </p><p>MAJOR PROJECTS."  HCMC WILL RECEIVE A GREAT DEAL OF </p><p>SCRUTINY IN THIS PILOT PHASE OF DEVOLUTION, BOTH FROM </p><p>HANOI AS WELL AS FROM OTHER LARGE CITIES SUCH AS DANANG </p><p>AND CAN THO WHICH WILL SEEK SIMILAR INDEPENDENCE.  WILL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00117  02 OF 02  050818Z </p><p>THESE NEW POWERS MAKE THE CITY MORE RESPONSIVE, </p><p>EFFICIENT, AND ACCOUNTABLE?  THE SIGNS ARE POSITIVE. </p><p>DECREE 93 FOLLOWS A SERIES OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>REFORMS THAT HAVE STREAMLINED INVESTMENT AND OTHER </p><p>LICENSING PROCEDURES HERE IN HCMC -- AND ARE ONE REASON </p><p>HCMC GENERATES SO MUCH OF VIETNAM\'S INVESTMENT AND </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
