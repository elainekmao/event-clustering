<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000065 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL/IRF, CA/VO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, PHUM, PGOV, PREL, SOCI, KIRF, VM, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT:  RELIGIOUS FREEDOM: THE VIEW THROUGH THE VISA </p><p>WINDOW </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Consular associate recently interviewed a Korean </p><p>missionary affiliated with the Global Mission Society of the </p><p>Presbyterian Church in Korea for a nonimmigrant visa (NIV). </p><p>The applicant, who described himself as a missionary pastor </p><p>with an "underground" Protestant church, said he conducted </p><p>services wherever he could within his geographic area of </p><p>responsibility, which included the Central Highlands and the </p><p>southern part of Vietnam.  While the applicant cited </p><p>continued problems in dealing with government authorities -- </p><p>he described Dak Lak province as a particularly difficult </p><p>place to hold services and practice his faith -- he felt it </p><p>was easier to conduct his work now than in the past. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  NIV applicant went on to say that he had been an </p><p>active missionary in Vietnam for about 10 years.  He lived </p><p>here with his Korean wife and children, who attended a </p><p>"missionary school."  (Note:  His passport contained a </p><p>number of renewed Vietnamese tourist visas, the more recent </p><p>of which were multiple entry.)  The most difficult years </p><p>were 1993-1995, when he and his family were under such tight </p><p>surveillance that they considered themselves under de facto </p><p>house arrest.  In contrast, the ever-growing number of </p><p>worshippers throughout the communities he served today made </p><p>him feel more comfortable in carrying out his activities. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  NIV applicant came to Conoff\'s attention when he </p><p>applied for a tourist visa to attend the 2003 Centennial </p><p>World Mission Conference of Korean Christian immigration in </p><p>Honolulu.  (Note:  2003 marks the 100th Anniversary of </p><p>Korean immigration to the United States.  NIV applicant was </p><p>trained in Korea but has connections with congregations in </p><p>the U.S.)  While it is not uncommon for members of the </p><p>Protestant faith to apply for NIV\'s, anecdotal evidence </p><p>suggests that most are Baptist.  Throughout the interview, </p><p>NIV applicant insisted on speaking English.  He eventually </p><p>became so agitated over the presence of a Vietnamese FSN </p><p>assisting with interpretation that the interview was moved </p><p>to a private room. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Comment:  Consular associate was able to take </p><p>advantage of a nonimmigrant visa interview to gain some </p><p>insight into the life of a foreign Protestant missionary </p><p>resident in HCMC.  This cable does not mean to imply that </p><p>one pastor\'s circumstances have a broad significance for the </p><p>religious freedom situation in Vietnam writ large.  It does </p><p>provide some interesting perspectives on the mixture of </p><p>restrictions, harsh pressures and considerable ability to </p><p>worship that often seem to characterize the experience of </p><p>clergy from unregistered or suspect religious groups.  In </p><p>this case the pastor was clearly extremely wary of GVN </p><p>authorities based on his own experience of hardship.  At the </p><p>same time, despite his religious activities, he appears to </p><p>have been able to stay in Vietnam for a long time with </p><p>relative ease, travel widely including in sensitive areas, </p><p>and see the numbers of his worshippers increase. </p><p> </p><p>WHITE </p><p></p></div>
