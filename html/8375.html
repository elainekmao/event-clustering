<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0148 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MAY 30, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for May 30, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Sabah/Hurriyet: As a result of ensuing </p><p>clashes between the security forces and a group </p><p>of PKK-KADEK militants who had set up an ambush </p><p>near Bingol yesterday evening, one soldier was </p><p>killed while seven others were wounded. As </p><p>clashes continued, enforcement units were </p><p>dispatched to the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Hurriyet: Charges were brought against a </p><p>shepherd named Suleyman because he grazed his </p><p>live stocks in Bingol at night. The court </p><p>demanded two and a half months of imprisonment </p><p>for the shepherd for acting in opposition to the </p><p>orders given by authorities. The shepherd </p><p>appealed the case to the Supreme Court. The </p><p>Supreme Court acquitted Suleyman on the grounds </p><p>that the state was responsible for promoting live </p><p>stock raising and supporting the live stock </p><p>raisers for increasing production, and that the </p><p>ban was not in confirmation with the </p><p>Constitution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Hurriyet: After his speech at the War Academy </p><p>on EU and assorted issues, the Vice Chief of TGS, </p><p>General Buyukanit, clarified his views about his </p><p>abstention on use of mother tongue in </p><p>broadcasting. General Buyukanit was quoted as </p><p>saying, "When there are thousands of terrorists </p><p>in the country, we can not pretend as though they </p><p>do not exist. It would not matter if broadcasting </p><p>on the country\'s television was made in Chinese </p><p>or Arabic if there had been no terrorist threat </p><p>in our country." Drawing attention to the </p><p>difficulty in controlling the TV channels, </p><p>General Buyukanit said "RTUK\'s (Radio and </p><p>Televison High Council) offices in Anatolia are </p><p>being closed down. Who is going to inspect these </p><p>private broadcasts? Once it was debated on a </p><p>private TV channel in Diyarbakir whether the </p><p>Independent Kurdish State should be Islamist or </p><p>secular. Controlling is not as easy as it is </p><p>thought. First of all, the idea would emerge, and </p><p>then weapons would be given to people. At the </p><p>moment, there are 900-armed PKK militants within </p><p>the borders. Is this a threat? At a time, Kocero </p><p>(a bandit) was only one person, and he was a </p><p>threat. From this angle, we perceive broadcasting </p><p>in the mother tongue as a threat." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Sabah: The Batman Women\'s Platform decided to </p><p>arrange a poem and essay competition in Turkish </p><p>and Kurdish on "War, Peace and Women." The </p><p>platform applied to the governor\'s office to </p><p>obtain permission. The authorities denied its </p><p>request on the grounds that no such entity </p><p>legally existed. The governor\'s decision is found </p><p>odd because Turkey is trying to pass bills to </p><p>make it permissible to broadcast in Kurdish on </p><p>private TV channels. An inmate in Batman prison, </p><p>Fahriye Ceylan, hoping the permission for the </p><p>contest would be granted, sent a poem in Kurdish </p><p>to the jury. The poem was illegible because it </p><p>was entirely scratched out by the prison </p><p>administration. The prison administration\'s note </p><p>on the poem stated, "It has been scratched out </p><p>because it was written in a not understandable </p><p>language." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Milliyet: Adana\'s Mayor Aytac Durak, who </p><p>faced up to one year of imprisonment on the </p><p>charges of abuse of authority while in office, </p><p>also benefited from the amnesty law. Durak was </p><p>charged of violating several laws and rules </p><p>between 1996 and 1998. His file has been </p><p>suspended for five years. If Mayor Durak commits </p><p>a crime within five years, he will be given a </p><p>penalty for the previous charges as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Bolge/Cumhuriyet: Although the harvesting of </p><p>wheat has started in the Cukurova Plain, the </p><p>government has not announced the basic rate for </p><p>the product yet. The producers said they suffered </p><p>approximately a 10 percent loss in yield due to </p><p>extreme heat and northeast wind in May. The </p><p>farmers said the government should take world </p><p>market prices into account and announce a basic </p><p>price not less than 0.26 or 0.28 USD per kilo. </p><p>Merchants have been buying wheat at 0.21 or 0.22 </p><p>US dollar per kilo. The President of Yuregir\'s </p><p>Chamber of Agriculture, Sahin Tekin, said TMO </p><p>(Soil Products Office) was not friendly to </p><p>farmers anymore because it acted in a business- </p><p>minded manner. Tekin said it was impossible to </p><p>feed 70 million people with imported wheat, and </p><p>therefore, he said the government should support </p><p>the farmers to increase the wheat production. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
