<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000680 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: HIMALAYAN TOURISM HEADED DOWNHILL </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 568 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  Nepal\'s tourism industry, one of the </p><p>country\'s top sources of foreign exchange, has been </p><p>facing tough times in recent months, and the prolonged </p><p>slump has negatively affected every sector of the </p><p>tourism economy, from hotels and airlines to trekking </p><p>agencies.  International arrivals at Tribhuvan </p><p>International Airport were down by 56% this February, </p><p>and occupancy rates at hotels around Kathmandu are at </p><p>40% on average.  Although the GON has announced several </p><p>relief measures, the mood among industry professionals </p><p>ranges from skeptical to bleak, with most business </p><p>owners blaming their woes on domestic and international </p><p>security concerns. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>VACANT ROOMS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. Nepal\'s hotel industry has been hit hard by the </p><p>decline in tourist revenues, with five-star hotels </p><p>apparently hit the hardest.  While most hotels in the </p><p>capital report 40-45% rates of occupancy, the Yak and </p><p>Yeti, one of Kathmandu\'s oldest luxury hotels, reported </p><p>an occupancy rate of 25% for March, and the newer Hyatt </p><p>cited a dismal 10-15% for the same month.  The Crown </p><p>Plaza Soaltee is running at about 50%, according to its </p><p>owner.  Conversely, the less sumptuous Kathmandu Guest </p><p>House was bucking the trend with an occupancy rate of </p><p>90%.  It appears clear that the high end of the tourist </p><p>trade is taking a larger hit than the low -- backpacking </p><p>-- end. </p><p> </p><p>3. Deepak Upraity, General Manager of Kathmandu\'s </p><p>Shangri-La Hotel, estimates that occupancy in the </p><p>capital is down 50% compared to last year\'s figures. </p><p>According to Upraity, the decline may be too much to </p><p>bear for an industry already suffering from oversupply. </p><p>"We haven\'t started laying people off yet," he said in a </p><p>meeting with EmbOff, "but we\'ve stopped filling staff </p><p>vacancies, and we\'ve asked people to go on leave.  We\'re </p><p>holding local events just to keep the staff busy and </p><p>keep [the hotel] going. But we\'re also looking at ways </p><p>to start seriously cutting costs." </p><p> </p><p>4. March is typically one of the best months for tourism </p><p>in Nepal-- good enough to sustain the industry through </p><p>the lean summer monsoon season.  But this year, with an </p><p>occupancy rate of 45% in March and an expected 25% </p><p>occupancy rate in June, Upraity is not optimistic. </p><p>"Tourism has been steadily declining since 1999," he </p><p>lamented, referring to the year in which an Indian </p><p>Airlines jet was hijacked on departure from Kathmandu. </p><p>"Last year, people had already made bookings when the </p><p>royal massacre happened, and so they kept coming because </p><p>they didn\'t want to cancel.  But now?" He simply </p><p>shrugged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EMPTY SEATS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5. Immigration data documents the drastic decline in the </p><p>number of foreign arrivals at Tribhuvan International </p><p>Airport (TIA) when compared to last year.  American </p><p>arrivals were down by approximately 62% in January, with </p><p>1101 Amcits arriving this year, compared with 2950 in </p><p>2001.  February numbers reflect a 56% decrease, from </p><p>3296 last year to 1436 this year. Total arrivals by </p><p>third-country nationals (excluding India) were down by </p><p>62% in January and 59% in February.  Indian arrivals, </p><p>perhaps boosted by the SAARC Summit, were only down by </p><p>24% in January, but dropped by 41% the following month. </p><p> </p><p>6. Several airlines have cancelled service as a result </p><p>of the shrinking demand for service.  The Dutch carrier </p><p>Transavia will suspend flights to Kathmandu starting on </p><p>April 28; Russian carrier Aeroflot is also canceling its </p><p>Kathmandu schedule.  Thai Airways, which runs daily </p><p>service to and from Bangkok, reports that their incoming </p><p>flights are only carrying 30-40% of capacity, and a </p><p>personnel officer at Royal Nepal Airlines, the national </p><p>carrier, told EmbOff in March that the airline is "on </p><p>the verge of complete collapse". </p><p> </p><p>7. Domestic airlines are also feeling the heat, with </p><p>several of the small local companies laying off workers. </p><p>Tulsi Karmacharya, Manager of NECON Air, stated that his </p><p>company has had to lay off 25% of their workers, due in </p><p>part to the decline in tourism, and Mountain Air has </p><p>forced employees to take leave without pay starting in </p><p>February. </p><p> </p><p>DESERTED TREKKING ROUTES </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. The lack of tourism has been devastating to Nepal\'s </p><p>multitude of trekking firms, as the worsening security </p><p>situation has made visitors less willing to travel to </p><p>remote areas with poor communication and transportation </p><p>infrastructure. Recent Maoist activities, such as </p><p>blocking the road to Jiri, the origin point for the </p><p>Everest trek, are likely to further impact the industry. </p><p>Tsering Dorjee, Sales Manager at Malla Treks, indicated </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>that their business was down by more than 50% and that </p><p>many of their guides, cooks and porters, all of whom </p><p>work on contract, are simply out of work.  "It\'s all </p><p>because of the security situation," Dorjee said.  "No </p><p>one wants to venture out anywhere." </p><p> </p><p>9. Foothills Trekking, which schedules about 40-50 </p><p>groups during the first three months of a normal year, </p><p>is experiencing an even sharper decline in business. </p><p>According to its Chairman, Birendra Gurung, the company </p><p>has scheduled just three trekking groups so far this </p><p>year.  "Everyone has the same problem," Gurung stated. </p><p>"Maybe the number one or number two company has more </p><p>groups, but everyone else is really suffering." </p><p>Anecdotal evidence supports this: trekking guides and </p><p>agents applying for non-immigrant visas since the start </p><p>of the year have been reporting a complete evaporation </p><p>of business, and have been presenting documents that </p><p>show little or no income since September of last year. </p><p> </p><p>SAME PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. Kathmandu\'s hotels have historically survived the </p><p>monsoon thanks to the trickle of tourists transiting </p><p>Nepal on their way to Tibet, but hotels in Nepal\'s </p><p>second city of Pokhara rely on Indian business travelers </p><p>to fill their rooms during the rainy season. According </p><p>to Shangri-La\'s Upraity, the situation in Pokhara is </p><p>even worse than in the capital and not expected to get </p><p>any better.  Claiming that tourism in Pokhara was down </p><p>by 60-80%, he said that the worsening security situation </p><p>had eroded the "friendly, brotherly impression" that </p><p>Indian tourists had previously had of Nepal, and </p><p>predicted a continuing freefall in occupancy rates. </p><p> </p><p>11. Even the Tiger Tops/Tiger Mountain juggernaut, which </p><p>helped to pioneer eco-tourism in the jungle parks and </p><p>mountain regions of the country, has been affected by </p><p>the general decline in tourism. Tiger Tops CEO Kristjan </p><p>Edwards told EmbOff that occupancy in the various Tiger </p><p>Tops lodges is approximately 50%, even after the company </p><p>closed its popular Tented Camp in Royal Chitwan National </p><p>Park and began offering reduced rates to the other </p><p>resorts for both residents and foreign tourists.  One </p><p>night at the Tiger Tops Jungle Lodge cost $325 in 2000; </p><p>this year the rate is as low as $75 per night. </p><p> </p><p>12. Though Tiger Tops has been able to keep 95% of its </p><p>staff employed to this point, Edwards stated that </p><p>they\'ve reduced salaries in order to meet costs, and </p><p>that in a normal year the company would be hiring above </p><p>attrition rather than asking people to leave.  "There </p><p>was a sharp decrease after September 11, and things have </p><p>stayed about the same ever since," he said. "Hopefully </p><p>things won\'t drop off too much more, or we\'ll have to </p><p>make some drastic cuts." </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  The GON has begun to make changes to visa policies </p><p>and other regulations in an effort to encourage tourism </p><p>and other foreign travel to Nepal, but industry </p><p>professionals are skeptical about the effectiveness of </p><p>the new measures. Soft loans to hotels and other </p><p>hospitality businesses were promised by the government </p><p>but have not, as yet, materialized. According to the </p><p>Shangri-La\'s Upraity, neither banks nor the government </p><p>want to take responsibility for loans that may very well </p><p>end up in default. </p><p> </p><p>14. Declaring 2002-2003 as \'Destination Nepal Year\', and </p><p>hoping to capitalize on this year\'s status as </p><p>International Mountaineering Tourism Year and the </p><p>fiftieth anniversary of the first successful ascent of </p><p>Mount Everest, the GON has opened up an additional 103 </p><p>Himalayan peaks for mountaineering. Climbing fees for 60 </p><p>peaks have been reduced or eliminated, and the </p><p>bureaucracy required to climb peaks of less than 6500 </p><p>meters has been simplified, eliminating the need for a </p><p>liaison officer.  Response to the measures has been </p><p>lukewarm, with most comments in the press echoing those </p><p>of Tek Chandra Pokharel, a prominent industry </p><p>entrepreneur. "Those were steps that should have been </p><p>taken long, long ago," he said in a March interview. </p><p>"They are welcome, but merely opening a few more </p><p>peaks... will not help now." </p><p> </p><p>15.  To counteract the drop-off in tourism from the U.S. </p><p>and other typical source countries, the GON and the </p><p>Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) have been courting Nepal\'s </p><p>northern neighbor, hoping to attract China\'s burgeoning </p><p>tourist population. In November of last year, the GON </p><p>signed an MOU with China regarding procedures for </p><p>Chinese tourists to visit the country and has since </p><p>approved 78 travel agencies to handle Chinese tourists. </p><p>Earlier this year, NTB invited a group of Chinese travel </p><p>journalists to tour the country\'s most poplar </p><p>destinations, and the board has been producing pamphlets </p><p>and CD-ROM promotional materials in Chinese. </p><p>Nevertheless, Chinese arrivals at TIA dropped by 52% </p><p>during the first two months of this year, compared with </p><p>the same period last year. </p><p> </p><p>16. COMMENT:  While backpackers and trekkers continue to </p><p>come to Nepal, albeit in much lower numbers than usual, </p><p>wealthier "high-yield" travelers appear to have been </p><p>scared off by the declining security situation.   Maoist </p><p>leadership released a letter in March (REF) containing </p><p>assurances that they are not targeting the tourism </p><p>industry, but also containing threats to foreign </p><p>tourists and Nepali businesses alike.  Though the events </p><p>of September 11 and ongoing tensions in the region have </p><p>had some negative effect on tourism in Nepal, the major </p><p>threat to that sector of the economy derives from the </p><p>domestic insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>17. Potential tourists, alerted by increased </p><p>international news coverage of continuing violence by </p><p>the Maoists, are researching the security situation in </p><p>Nepal and rethinking or abandoning travel plans.  The </p><p>trickle-down effect has deprived trekking guides, cooks, </p><p>porters and other low-income contract workers of much- </p><p>needed seasonal income.  Hotel workers, airline </p><p>employees and travel agents may soon face unemployment. </p><p>The severe effect that the downturn has already had on </p><p>the industry has the potential to turn into economic </p><p>disaster if the trend continues unchecked.  Blame for </p><p>most of the industry\'s woes lies squarely at the feet of </p><p>the Maoists, and once again calls into question the </p><p>insurgency\'s proclaimed dedication to the people. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
