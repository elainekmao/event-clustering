<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BRASILIA 001550 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO USTR FOR JWOLFE, SCRONIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, BR, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) </p><p>SUBJECT: BRAZIL CONTINUES TO DEBATE TRADE POLICY ON EVE OF </p><p>USTR ZOELLICK\'S VISIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: BRASILIA 01321 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Economic Officer Janice Fair for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p>. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an Action Request; please see para 15. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Summary.  In the run-up to USTR Zoellick\'s May </p><p>27-28 visit, debate has </p><p>intensified publicly, within the GoB, and perhaps most of all </p><p>in the Foreign Ministry, on </p><p>Brazil\'s participation in the FTAA negotiations.  A number of </p><p>policy options are </p><p>reportedly under consideration, including delay or </p><p>reformulation of the FTAA </p><p>negotiations, and tying the FTAA negotiations to a parallel, </p><p>more limited four-plus-one </p><p>(Mercosul-U.S.) agreement.  FTAA skeptics within Brazil\'s </p><p>Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Relations (Itamaraty) appear pitted against certain other </p><p>ministries, such as Finance, </p><p>Agriculture and to some extent the Ministry of Development, </p><p>which favor a more forward </p><p>leaning GoB posture in the FTAA negotiations.  President Lula </p><p>is expected to convene an </p><p>interministerial meeting to forge a policy consensus before </p><p>USTR Zoellick\'s arrival. </p><p>Itamaraty has indicated that USTR Zoellick should be prepared </p><p>to discuss the possibility </p><p>of a four-plus-one negotiation during his meeting with </p><p>Minister Amorim on May 28.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Who\'s In Charge? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Despite campaign rhetoric asserting that the FTAA </p><p>would result in Brazil\'s </p><p>"annexation" to the United States, President Lula after </p><p>assuming power quickly </p><p>committed to continuing negotiations in good faith.  However, </p><p>the GoB\'s commitment to </p><p>the negotiations came under new question following Brazil\'s </p><p>decision not to submit </p><p>initial offers in the areas of services, investment and </p><p>government procurement according </p><p>to the previous negotiation schedule.  Since then, the </p><p>internal policy debates have plainly </p><p>intensified. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Major re-casting of the GoB\'s official attitudes could </p><p>be on the way. </p><p>Reorganization and personnel changes within Itamaraty have </p><p>placed officials with known </p><p>anti-FTAA sentiments in apparent de facto control of Brazil\'s </p><p>negotiating team.  Leading </p><p>this group is Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes, currently the number </p><p>two at Itamaraty as </p><p>Secretary-General.  Pinheiro Guimaraes was exiled to an </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>academic sinecure by then- </p><p>Foreign Minister Celso Lafer during the previous </p><p>administration because of his </p><p>outspoken public posture against the FTAA.  Guimaraes\' </p><p>advisor, Regis Percy Arslanian, </p><p>was part of the Brazilian delegation attending the recent </p><p>Trade Negotiating Committee </p><p>meeting in Puebla, Mexico; Arslanian was DCM of Brazil\'s </p><p>Embassy in Washington </p><p>until 2001. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In what appears to be a consolidation of control, in </p><p>early May, responsibility for </p><p>FTAA negotiations was removed from Clodoaldo Hugueney, </p><p>Undersecretary General for </p><p>Integration, Economy and Trade Affairs and previously </p><p>co-chair of the FTAA at the vice- </p><p>ministerial level along with DUSTR Peter Allgeier.  In the </p><p>move, FTAA as well as </p><p>Mercosul-EU negotiations were shifted to Itamaraty\'s new </p><p>Undersecretariat for South </p><p>America Affairs (ref a), headed by Luiz Felipe Macedo Soares, </p><p>Brazil\'s former </p><p>Ambassador to Mexico.  On May 14, Hugueney\'s assistant, </p><p>Pompeu Neto, implied that </p><p>Hugueney was removed because of his pro-FTAA views; Hugueney </p><p>had argued </p><p>unsuccessfully that Brazil should comply with the schedule </p><p>for initial offers. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On May 16, Itamaraty announced that Adhemar Bahadian, </p><p>Brazil\'s Consul </p><p>General in Buenos Aires and a personal friend of Minister </p><p>Amorim and Pinheiro </p><p>Guimaraes, would take over the FTAA co-chair </p><p>responsibilities.  Bahadian is reported to </p><p>have extensive trade experience including negotiations under </p><p>GATT, work at the World </p><p>Intellectual Property Organization and he served as Amorim\'s </p><p>alternate in the WTO from </p><p>2000 to 2002.  Bahadian was a Brazilian point person on </p><p>Summit of the Americas in the </p><p>late nineties and has served a total of ten years at the </p><p>United Nations.  He was an </p><p>Embassy contact while he was Chief of Staff for the Secretary </p><p>General from 1994 to </p><p>1996.  Carlos Alberto Simas Magalhaes will remain Brazil\'s </p><p>lead FTAA negotiator, a </p><p>position to which he was named in February by the new GoB. </p><p> </p><p>Internal Policy Debate </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Pinheiro Guimaraes\' evidently ascending role over </p><p>FTAA policy within Itamaraty </p><p>does not bode well for close, collaborative efforts on FTAA. </p><p>Neto expressed to us his </p><p>judgment that the intellectual formation of Pinheiro </p><p>Guimaraes and his allies dates back </p><p>to the seventies and is characterized by suspicion that the </p><p>United States aims to dominate </p><p>the hemisphere, as well as by an inward-focus relating to </p><p>economic development. </p><p>Despite the economic benefits that Brazil could gain through </p><p>an FTAA, Neto claims that </p><p>these decision-makers are guided by their suspicion and </p><p>ideological aversion to projects </p><p>supported by the United States. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In a strange twist, other ministries within the </p><p>government now seem to be out in </p><p>front of Itamaraty on trade liberalization.  After Finance </p><p>Minister Palocci\'s recent trip to </p><p>Washington, press reported (and Neto has confirmed to us) </p><p>that the Finance Ministry has </p><p>been trying to insert itself more into trade deliberations </p><p>out of concern over Itamaraty\'s </p><p>faltering support for the FTAA.  Chief of Staff Dirceu </p><p>confirmed to Ambassador during </p><p>their May 6 meeting that President Lula intends to convene a </p><p>meeting with ministers prior </p><p>to USTR Zoellick\'s arrival in order to arrive at a single GoB </p><p>position regarding trade </p><p>strategy. </p><p> </p><p>FTAA Policy Options </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) As reported in reftel, Itamaraty interlocutors claim </p><p>that proceeding with the </p><p>FTAA status quo is untenable for Brazil, given the current </p><p>impasse in WTO Doha </p><p>Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, the absence of key </p><p>Brazilian issues within the </p><p>scope of FTAA negotiations, and public hostility toward the </p><p>FTAA.  Specifically, they </p><p>point to the unwillingness of the United States to negotiate </p><p>new disciplines covering </p><p>domestic support for agriculture and unfair trade remedies </p><p>within the FTAA, and the U.S. </p><p>market access offers for goods, which were least favorable </p><p>for Mercosul, as limiting their </p><p>political flexibility to move forward in negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Therefore, the GoB is considering and will likely </p><p>propose to USTR Zoellick a </p><p>new approach toward bilateral trade relations and/or </p><p>reformulation of the FTAA </p><p>negotiations.  Local press has identified the following </p><p>policy options as under </p><p>consideration: </p><p> </p><p>--negotiation of a U.S.-Mercosul (four-plus-one) agreement is </p><p>the most often cited option. </p><p>Antonio Simoes, Economic Adviser to Foreign Minister Amorim, </p><p>has conveyed that </p><p>USTR Zoellick should be prepared to discuss this possibility </p><p>during his meeting with </p><p>Amorim on May 28.  Itamaraty interlocutors stress that the </p><p>four-plus-one would be </p><p>narrow in scope, perhaps limited to tariff-only, and </p><p>especially that it would be </p><p>supplemental to FTAA negotiations, not in lieu of. </p><p>--a reformulation of the FTAA to focus on tariffs, leaving </p><p>contentious issues for </p><p>negotiation within the WTO.  The GoB is concerned that </p><p>certain investment and </p><p>government procurement rules sought by the United States </p><p>would limit Brazil\'s ability to </p><p>pursue an economic development strategy utilizing industrial </p><p>policies. </p><p> </p><p>--bifurcation of the FTAA process into two stages - the first </p><p>stage of tariff-only </p><p>negotiations to be completed by 2005 with subsequent </p><p>launching of negotiations on the </p><p>remaining issues.  NOTE: However, once tariff negotiations </p><p>are complete, there would be </p><p>no guarantee that Brazil would feel compelled to participate </p><p>in negotiations in the areas it </p><p>has identified as problematic. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>--seeking a delay in the end date of the FTAA negotiations </p><p>until 2007.  Proponents argue </p><p>that progress cannot be made in the FTAA until the thorny </p><p>issues of domestic support and </p><p>unfair trade remedies are dealt with in the DDA negotiations, </p><p>which are unlikely to </p><p>conclude by 2005. </p><p> </p><p>--the more remote possibility of a U.S.-Brazil supplemental </p><p>negotiation.   We judge it </p><p>unlikely that Brazil would pursue such an option at this </p><p>time, particularly since Nestor </p><p>Kirchner, Argentina\'s President-elect, reaffirmed Argentina\'s </p><p>solidarity with Brazil\'s </p><p>intention to strengthen Mercosul during his trip to Brasilia </p><p>May 8. </p><p> </p><p>Implications </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Itamaraty interlocutors have stressed that all </p><p>options, even ones they are not </p><p>promoting, involve continuation of FTAA negotiations. </p><p>However, cynics warn that delay </p><p>of the process or reformulation of the negotiations are only </p><p>more subtle ways of </p><p>deliberately undermining the FTAA and leading to its eventual </p><p>demise. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) If the United States does not agree to any alteration </p><p>of FTAA substance or </p><p>process, or to the pursuit of a "supplemental" U.S.-Mercosul </p><p>agreement, post believes </p><p>that a "do nothing" strategy by the USG would not precipitate </p><p>an immediate withdrawal </p><p>of Brazil from the FTAA.  However, it would likely lead to a </p><p>hardening of Brazilian </p><p>positions as it seeks to slow down the process and elicit </p><p>support from other FTAA </p><p>countries on contentious issues such as domestic support </p><p>disciplines. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Complicating Brazil\'s FTAA analysis is its domestic </p><p>political scene. </p><p>Although Lula has widespread support to undertake thorny </p><p>social security and tax reform, </p><p>as the administration moves forward with its specific </p><p>proposals, the debate is bound to </p><p>become more polarized.  Five months into the administration, </p><p>the government is also </p><p>walking a fine line between kudos from the market on its </p><p>stringent macroeconomic </p><p>policies and the political backlash that may emerge due to </p><p>the scarcity of resources for </p><p>social spending that these policies yield.  On top of that, </p><p>PT radicals, supported by some </p><p>intellectuals and religious leaders, are pressing the </p><p>government for a referendum on </p><p>continuing with the FTAA.  The GoB would be politically hard </p><p>pressed at this time to </p><p>take on additional enemies in support of the currently </p><p>envisioned FTAA. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) According to Neto, the Pinheiro Guimaraes group is </p><p>convinced that Brazil\'s </p><p>negotiating position is stronger in a bilateral (4 1) than in </p><p>a regional negotiation. </p><p>Itamaraty believes that through a four-plus-one negotiation </p><p>Brazil can more quickly attain </p><p>market access for its key products (OJ, textiles, sugar, </p><p>footwear, etc.), scoring economic </p><p>and political success that would make continued participation </p><p>in the FTAA palatable. </p><p>Underlying this perception is the GoB\'s fear that the United </p><p>States will not come forward </p><p>in the FTAA with substantial, timely market access for key </p><p>Brazilian products.  The </p><p>policy options being considered by the GoB are designed to </p><p>avoid a disastrous end-of-day </p><p>scenario in which Brazil has negotiated issues of interest to </p><p>the United States (investment, </p><p>government procurement), and even though not getting what it </p><p>needs in return, is </p><p>compelled to sign the FTAA because diplomatically it cannot </p><p>be left outside the </p><p>hemispheric pact. </p><p> </p><p>Action Request </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) In pursuing a four-plus-one negotiation, the GoB </p><p>may feel emboldened by </p><p>U.S. negotiations with other countries in the region. </p><p>However, it seems the GoB may </p><p>underestimate the obstacles to providing Brazil with the </p><p>market access concessions it </p><p>seeks on sensitive products that would be inherent in such an </p><p>agreement.  If the four-plus- </p><p>one option is a non-starter from the USG perspective, post </p><p>would appreciate guidance </p><p>from Washington agencies concerning the need to subtly </p><p>downplay it prior to USTR </p><p>Zoellick\'s arrival.   When deliberating on possible USG </p><p>reactions to GoB trade proposals, </p><p>post also suggests that Washington consider potential market </p><p>access carrots, such as </p><p>movement on some key Brazilian products in the revised U.S. </p><p>FTAA offer, to provide the </p><p>GoB with something tangible, but that would keep </p><p>deliberations squarely within the </p><p>FTAA and premised on Brazilian movement in all other FTAA </p><p>areas.  Additionally, any </p><p>forward movement on "discussing" domestic support within the </p><p>FTAA along the lines </p><p>envisioned in instructions from the April 8-11 TNC meeting in </p><p>Puebla could help </p><p>establish for Brazilians U.S. sincerity in claiming that </p><p>"everything is on the table" and </p><p>assist in diffusing the most contentious issue for Brazil in </p><p>the FTAA. </p><p>VIRDEN </p><p></p></div>
