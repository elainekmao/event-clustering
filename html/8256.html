<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 002451 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB, NEA/ARP, AND NEA/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 05/25/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KPAL, KWBG, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE: A MODEL FOR IRAQ? </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) STATE 131981  B) ABU DHABI 2256  C) DUBAI </p><p>1992 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Richard A. </p><p>Albright, for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment:  The UAE is eager to see </p><p>the swift reintegration of Iraq into the international </p><p>trade and investment system, and the emergence of </p><p>Baghdad as an economic counterweight to Riyadh in the </p><p>region.  Given the cumbersome nature of GCC </p><p>deliberations, and the sense here that the UAE already </p><p>is well ahead of its fellow member states when it </p><p>comes to economic liberalization, the UAE is likely to </p><p>prefer to engage Iraq bilaterally on trade and </p><p>investment issues rather than wait for a regional GCC </p><p>approach to be developed.  The UAE will seek to </p><p>further Iraq\'s economic recovery by offering its </p><p>expertise in the areas of banking and finance and oil, </p><p>and could also serve as a useful model in digital </p><p>readiness and the protection of intellectual property </p><p>rights (IPR).  Iraq probably will receive significant </p><p>UAE private (and perhaps official) investment -- </p><p>especially when a liberalized trading regime and legal </p><p>framework to protect foreign investors in Iraq are in </p><p>place.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>The UAE Offers Its Experts For Iraq\'s Recovery </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The UAEG already has provided specific </p><p>proposals for participation in Iraq\'s economic </p><p>recovery (ref B).  UAE officials committed to provide </p><p>training to Iraqi Central Bank officials in banking </p><p>operations, banking supervision and examination, and </p><p>anti-money laundering detection and investigation. </p><p>Combating terrorist financing through its formal and </p><p>informal financial networks has been a major goal of </p><p>the UAEG since 2000, and an area in which the UAEG has </p><p>made tremendous strides.  The UAE was the first Arab </p><p>country to become a member of the elite Egmont Group </p><p>of Financial Intelligence Units, and could well serve </p><p>as a model for Iraq\'s own financial system. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) </p><p>also has offered to help develop responsible fiscal </p><p>and monetary policy in Iraq, carve out a supervisory </p><p>role for the Iraq Central Bank, and help establish a </p><p>liberalized trade regime that would lead to Iraq\'s </p><p>eventual accession to the WTO.  The AMF has expertise </p><p>in a broad range of economic topics, as well as a </p><p>formal agreement with the WTO to provide training on </p><p>trade-related issues to its Arab membership -- which </p><p>includes Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) UAE officials have indicated that they could </p><p>dispatch experts from the Abu Dhabi National Oil </p><p>Company (ADNOC) to assist in the near term </p><p>reconstruction of the Iraqi oil sector.  Although the </p><p>UAE could assist the Iraqi Oil Ministry in oil </p><p>exploration, refining, processing, distribution and </p><p>management, Abu Dhabi realistically will be Baghdad\'s </p><p>competitor in this sector over the long-term. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Senior UAE officials have been actively </p><p>engaged with the USG regarding Iraq\'s reconstruction </p><p>even before the war, including high level visits to </p><p>Washington to promote potential participation in terms </p><p>of assistance, investment and trade.  Recently, 100 </p><p>Iraqi businessmen formed an off-shore corporation in </p><p>the Jebel Ali Free Zone (ref C), with the strong </p><p>support of the Government of Dubai, to compete for </p><p>Iraqi reconstruction contracts (Comment:  Dubai is </p><p>perturbed by the fact that while the Jordanian/Iraq </p><p>border appears wide open for commerce, the port of Umm </p><p>Qasr, Dubai\'s lifeline to the Iraqi marketplace, </p><p>remains closed.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>The UAE: A Model Of Success </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The UAE, and Dubai in particular, is well </p><p>ahead of the rest of the region in terms of telecom </p><p>interconnectivity and digital readiness, and could </p><p>serve as a model for communications systems in Iraq. </p><p>Telecom networks in the UAE are based on cutting-edge </p><p>technology, and local governments and businesses are </p><p>regional pioneers in e-government and e-commerce </p><p>initiatives.  We note that Thuraya -- which, to our </p><p>knowledge, is one of only two mobile phone service </p><p>providers currently operating in Iraq -- is based in </p><p>Abu Dhabi, with the UAEG as a major shareholder. </p><p>8.  (C) The UAE is at the forefront of protecting </p><p>intellectual property rights (IPR) in the region. </p><p>Although there is room for improvement in consistent </p><p>implementation, the UAE represents a useful example of </p><p>the strides that can be made working hand-in-hand with </p><p>U.S. Government and businesses to protect property </p><p>rights.  As part and parcel of its development into a </p><p>regional trading center, the UAE Government has made </p><p>the protection of intellectual property a priority in </p><p>recent years.  New copyright, trademark and patent </p><p>laws, passed in 2002, provide high levels of </p><p>protection for U.S. intellectual property, while an </p><p>agreement -- brokered by the Embassy in 2002 -- </p><p>continues to provide TRIPs-plus levels of protection </p><p>for U.S. pharmaceuticals. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Tapping UAE Capital </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The UAE\'s two stock exchanges in Abu Dhabi or </p><p>Dubai offer a pool of investment capital for Iraqi </p><p>companies.  The Abu Dhabi Securities Market (ADSM), </p><p>for example, currently lists 21 local and foreign </p><p>companies on its trading board from several different </p><p>sectors, including banking, insurance, services </p><p>(telecom and IT-related companies), hotels, and is </p><p>actively courting more foreign businesses.  Oatar\'s </p><p>telecom monopoly, Q-Tel, already is listed and ADSM is </p><p>negotiating with the National Bank of Kuwait to list </p><p>later this year. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The UAEG itself is unlikely to invest </p><p>significantly in Iraq; the Abu Dhabi Investment </p><p>Authority has told us that very little of its </p><p>estimated $200 billion in assets is invested in the </p><p>Middle East  -- mostly to American, European, and </p><p>Asian markets.  The UAE Offsets Group and the </p><p>International Petroleum Investment Company, however, </p><p>are just two of several quasi-governmental </p><p>organizations that may seek both portfolio and </p><p>greenfield investments in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) UAE construction, transportation, and </p><p>logistics companies are likely to invest significant </p><p>equities in starting businesses in Iraq, upgrading </p><p>Iraq\'s infrastructure, and directly contributing to </p><p>Iraq\'s economic recovery.  Prominent UAE companies </p><p>with state-of-the-art technology, electronic mapping, </p><p>and positioning equipment are vying to upgrade and </p><p>manage the major Iraqi airports and seaports.  Dubai\'s </p><p>successful creation and management of numerous free </p><p>zones may serve as a model for Iraq.  Indeed, UAE </p><p>officials already have proposed the construction of </p><p>three free zones in southern, central, and northern </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>12.
