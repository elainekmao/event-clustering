TOM MCDONALD.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: AN OPPOSITION ADVISOR AND RELIABLE </p><p>EMBASSY CONTACT REPORTED TO THE AMBASSADOR SEPTEMBER 14 </p><p>AN UPSURGE IN POLICE HARASSMENT OF THE OPPOSITION.  AT </p><p>THE TOP OF THE LIST WAS A RAID ON THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) HEADQUARTERS TODAY AND AN </p><p>ATTEMPT TO ARREST TWO SENIOR MDC OFFICIALS.  POLICE ARE </p><p>ALSO REPORTED TO BE HARASSING OWNERS AND FARM WORKERS ON </p><p>FARMS IN THE HARARE AREA.  THE POLICE ACTIONS MAY BE </p><p>PARTLY A GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO MDC CALLS FOR CIVIL </p><p>DISOBEDIENCE AND PARTLY AN ATTEMPT TO ASSERT MORE </p><p>CONTROL OVER A POLICE FORCE INCREASINGLY SYMPATHETIC TO </p><p>THE OPPOSITION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  MDC ADVISOR AND CONFIDANT CLIVE PUZEY CALLED ON THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SEPTEMBER 14 ON SHORT NOTICE TO REPORT AN </p><p>UPSURGE IN POLICE HARASSMENT OF THE OPPOSITION.  HE </p><p>STATED THAT THE ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE (ZRP) ENTERED </p><p>MDC HEADQUARTERS ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 14 WITH A </p><p>WARRANT TO SEARCH FOR HIDDEN ARMS CACHES.  (UNKNOWN </p><p>ASSAILANTS SLIGHTLY DAMAGED THE HEADQUARTERS ENTRANCE </p><p>WITH A TYPE OF GRENADE LATE ON THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER </p><p>11.  SEE REFTEL.)  HAVING FOUND NO WEAPONS, THE ZRP </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO ARREST, WITHOUT A WARRANT, TWO MDC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05187  01 OF 02  141445Z </p><p>OFFICIALS, ONE OF THEM BEING GANDI MUDZINGWA, MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI\'S POLITICAL ASSISTANT AND </p><p>RIGHT-HAND MAN.  PUZEY DID NOT KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THE </p><p>OTHER OFFICIAL BEING SOUGHT.  (MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS </p><p>CURRENTLY IN MANICALAND ON AN "OPINION CANVASSING" TRIP, </p><p>ACCORDING TO PUZEY).  HAVING NOT FOUND EITHER OFFICIAL, </p><p>THE ZRP HAS SEALED OFF MDC HEADQUARTERS IN THE BELIEF </p><p>THAT THE TWO OFFICIALS ARE IN HIDING SOMEWHERE IN THE </p><p>BUILDING.  PUZEY REPORTED THAT THE PRESS, MDC LAWYERS, </p><p>MDC MPS, AND OTHER SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN CALLED TO THE </p><p>SCENE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PRESSURE THE ZRP TO LEAVE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) PUZEY ALSO SAID THAT THE ZRP IS STEPPING UP ITS </p><p>HARASSMENT OF COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND OTHER PERCEIVED MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.  HE CITED ONE FARMER NEAR </p><p>HARARE AS BEING SOUGHT BY THE ZRP FOR INCITING HIS </p><p>WORKERS TO ATTACK WAR VETERANS.  THE FARMER CALLED IN </p><p>HIS LAWYER TO TRY TO KEEP THE POLICE AT BAY, BUT IT IS </p><p>UNKNOWN IF HE WAS DETAINED.  THE "DAILY NEWS" REPORTED A </p><p>SIMILAR STORY SEPTEMBER 14 IN WHICH SEVERAL WAR VETERANS </p><p>WERE HOSPITALIZED AFTER "HEAVY FIGHTING" WITH FARM </p><p>WORKERS ON A HARARE-AREA FARM.  THE FIGHTING WAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY SPARKED BY FARM WORKERS REACTING TO </p><p>HARASSMENT BY THE WAR VETERANS.  THE NEWS STORY </p><p>INDICATED THAT POLICE OFFICERS LATER RETURNED TO THE </p><p>FARM AND ACTED "OPENLY HOSTILE" TO THE WORKERS, BEGAN </p><p>PUSHING AND SHOVING THEM, AND ACCUSED THEM OF BEING </p><p>ANTOGONISTIC TO THE WAR VETERANS\' CAUSE.  THE WAR </p><p>VETERANS, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE POLICE, THREATENED TO </p><p>KILL THE FARM\'S OWNER, ARTHUR HARLEY, FOR INCITING HIS </p><p>WORKERS.  HARLEY REPORTEDLY THEN WENT INTO HIDING. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05187  01 OF 02  141445Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WHEN ASKED WHY THE ZRP WAS SUDDENLY STEPPING UP </p><p>ITS HARASSMENT OF THE MDC, PUZEY OFFERED A MULTITUDE OF </p><p>POSSIBLE REASONS.  HE CITED THE MDC\'S CALLS FOR </p><p>IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT MUGABE, ITS CALLS LAST WEEK FOR </p><p>CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AND WORK STAY-AWAYS, AND THE GROWING </p><p>CLAMOR FOR CHANGE COMING FROM THE MDC BENCH IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  HE ALSO STATED THAT SUPPORT FOR THE MDC IS </p><p>GROWING IN THE ZRP, AND THAT SENIOR GOZ OFFICIALS HAVE </p><p>DEMANDED THAT HIGH-RANKING POLICE OFFICIALS TAKE MORE </p><p>ACTION IN FAVOR OF THE WAR VETERANS.  THESE SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIALS HAD THREATENED THE CHILDREN OF THESE POLICE </p><p>OFFICERS IF THEY DID NOT TAKE ACTION, ACCORDING TO </p><p>PUZEY.  PUZEY ALSO MENTIONED THAT TRIBAL ELDERS ACROSS </p><p>ZIMBABWE ARE FED UP WITH MUGABE AND WILL BE COMING TO </p><p>HARARE SOON TO DEMAND CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: PUZEY, A WELL-KNOWN LOCAL BUSINESSMAN </p><p>AND RELIABLE EMBASSY CONTACT, APPEARED VERY DISTRAUGHT </p><p>AT THE POLICE ACTION, THE FIRST OVERT GOVERNMENT ACTION </p><p>AGAINST THE MDC SINCE IT CAPTURED 57 SEATS IN JUNE\'S </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL HOW FAR </p><p>THIS WILL GO AND WHETHER THIS IS PART OF A WIDER </p><p>NATIONWIDE CRACKDOWN ON OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES AND </p><p>SUPPORTERS.
