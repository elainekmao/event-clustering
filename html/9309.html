<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 004233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR SAUMS </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - ABIGAIL DEMOPULOS </p><p>USDOC/4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIANS FEELING UPBEAT, FOR A CHANGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS 1.5 ( </p><p>B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary.  Jordan is currently on a high:  the war in </p><p>Iraq is over, parliamentary elections succeeded, the World </p><p>Economic Forum was a shot in the arm, there is movement on </p><p>the roadmap, the stock market is up, foreign debt is down, </p><p>and Jordan\'s credit rating was just upgraded.  The private </p><p>sector is looking for new opportunities in Iraq and to the </p><p>west of the Jordan River and new foreign investment seems to </p><p>be coming in from the Gulf.  This is a welcome mood swing, </p><p>but setbacks in the peace process and instability in Iraq </p><p>could reverse the swing.  Jordan will need continued </p><p>encouragement to move forward with reforms as well as </p><p>continued financial support to help spread economic benefits </p><p>more broadly in the society.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Feeling Good About Ourselves </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Having weathered the war with Iraq with minimal </p><p>economic fallout (thanks to U.S. assistance), held </p><p>parliamentary elections, and received an international boost </p><p>from the President\'s visit to Aqaba and the World Economic </p><p>Forum (WEF) meetings at the Dead Sea, Jordanians are feeling </p><p>good about themselves.  Sourness no doubt remains among </p><p>"intellectuals," journalists, and old guard politicians, but </p><p>the overall mood of government and the private sector </p><p>contacts these days is one of optimism and even enthusiasm </p><p>about the future. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>And Even about the United States </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  As Israel and the Palestinians take first steps on </p><p>the road to peace, the good feelings are even spilling over </p><p>into the way Jordanians see the United States.  Attendance at </p><p>our Fourth of July reception was unprecedented in recent </p><p>memory.  The heavyweight U.S. delegation to the WEF was </p><p>noticed and appreciated by Jordanians, who were buoyed by </p><p>Secretary Powell\'s, Ambassador Zoellick\'s and other officials </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>repeated references to Jordan as the region\'s model for good </p><p>policy. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Private/Public Sectors Buoyant </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Rather than the economic and political catastrophe </p><p>so many feared would result from the severing of Jordan\'s </p><p>"special" economic relationship with Iraq, there is a </p><p>boomtown atmosphere in the private economy.  Iraqis with cold </p><p>cash are buying up everything from cars, to clothing and </p><p>consumer goods, to manufactured products.  Lines at the Iraqi </p><p>border are miles long.  Brimming with schemes to get involved </p><p>in Iraqi reconstruction, businesspeople are again looking </p><p>west to participate in rebuilding the shattered West Bank </p><p>economy.  At the same time, there appears to be a new </p><p>interest by Gulf investors in Jordan.  The leading mobile </p><p>phone company was purchased by a Kuwaiti counterpart earlier </p><p>in the year, and Saudi investors are moving into real estate </p><p>and retail development in Aqaba, Amman, and the Dead Sea. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  A similar loosening is true in politics. </p><p>Parliamentary elections were conducted with relative ease and </p><p>the outcome maintained the traditional balance as tribal </p><p>groupings retained the upper hand over Palestinians and </p><p>Islamists.  Increasingly, Jordanians are spontaneously </p><p>approaching us to say that, in the end, the U.S. did the </p><p>right thing in Iraq.  The Aqaba Summit and movement on the </p><p>roadmap also brought relief.  The trade and water ministers </p><p>noted with satisfaction that they were able to have their </p><p>first public meetings with Israeli counterparts in years </p><p>during the WEF.  After some hesitant contacts with the </p><p>Embassy during the war, other ministers are now competing </p><p>among themselves to be the first to go to meet CPA in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Real Economy Scarred by the War, but Looking up </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The limited numbers available bear out the positive </p><p>mood.  With the economy preparing for war, real GDP in the </p><p>first quarter (not seasonally adjusted) declined 13% compared </p><p>to the previous quarter, which was itself down 2% over the </p><p>third quarter.  But compared to the first quarter of 2002, </p><p>GDP actually grew by 2.8%.  Besides seasonal drops in </p><p>construction and agriculture, manufacturing, electricity and </p><p>water, and wholesale and retail trade saw the sharpest </p><p>declines in activity in the first three months.  There also </p><p>appears to have been a drop in government spending following </p><p>a usual end of year spurt. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The focus, however, is on the 2.8% increase over the </p><p>first quarter of 2002.  Government officials and private </p><p>analysts hope this performance will be sustained through the </p><p>following three quarters to achieve a 3% annual growth rate. </p><p>Exports and QIZ activity remain solid.  January-April QIZ </p><p>textile production appeared to be up over 15% according to </p><p>partial results from Irbid\'s al-Hassan Industrial Estate. </p><p>The one down note is uncertainty over the status of contracts </p><p>for shipments to Iraq under the OFF and bilateral trade </p><p>protocol that were interrupted or for which payment was not </p><p>received due to the war.  The old-guard businesses that held </p><p>such contracts are putting the government under considerable </p><p>political pressure to make them whole. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>First Credit Upgrade in Years </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Financially, Jordan is in its best position in </p><p>decades.  Foreign reserves stand at $4.4 billion (including </p><p>the $700 million transferred by the United States to cover </p><p>war-related budget needs).  Banks are flush and the stock </p><p>market is up 32% from its pre-war low in February.  In a </p><p>another sign of market confidence, the finance ministry </p><p>recently succeeded in issuing $200 million in five-year JD </p><p>treasury bonds at 4.25%, about 2.25% over LIBOR, the lowest </p><p>spread ever.  An especially important vindication for Finance </p><p>Minister Marto\'s policies of fiscal restraint was Standard </p><p>and Poor\'s July 3 upgrade of Jordan\'s long term sovereign </p><p>credit rating to BB from BB-.  This was the first upgrade in </p><p>years and one that Marto hopes will be followed by Moody\'s </p><p>after it completes an assessment this month. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>2003:  A Balanced Budget is Possible </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Fiscally, the government is also feeling </p><p>comfortable.  According to its recently published staff </p><p>report, the IMF expects a JD 175 million deficit this year, </p><p>equivalent to 2.8% of GDP.  This improvement over the 5.0% </p><p>realized last year is mainly thanks to extraordinary </p><p>assistance from the United States, the Gulf states (in the </p><p>form of free oil), and Japan that more than offset the loss </p><p>of the oil subsidy from Iraq and additional spending related </p><p>to the war.  This outcome would reduce the external debt </p><p>burden by 4 percentage points, to 73% of GDP, compared with </p><p>90% in 1999 and over 100% earlier in the decade.  In fact, </p><p>Finance Secretary General Abu Hammour recently told ECON/C </p><p>that he thought the budget for the year could well end up in </p><p>balance, adding that Jordan had no intention of requesting </p><p>U.S. agreement to use the last $200 million of the recent </p><p>$700 million budget transfer this year. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  As Prime Minister Abul Ragheb and Marto reaffirmed </p><p>to Under Secretaries Larson and Taylor during the WEF, the </p><p>government remains committed to the undertakings it made to </p><p>the U.S.  All spending will be through the previously </p><p>approved budget (with "surplus" amounts going to deficit </p><p>reduction rather than new projects) and Jordan will continue </p><p>to implement steps to wean itself off cheap oil imports by </p><p>raising consumer prices of oil products. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>2004 Deficit Target Tougher, but Within Reach </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Meeting the IMF\'s 2004 deficit target of 3.9% of </p><p>GDP (JD 289 million) will be more difficult, but still seems </p><p>achievable.  Reserving $200 million of the $700 million </p><p>provided by the U.S. for the 2004 budget will be a big help, </p><p>as would continuation of the concessional oil supplies from </p><p>the Gulf.  Abu Hammour said that so far, the Saudis have </p><p>promised to continue the current arrangement only through </p><p>end-September, but that he was hopeful they would agree to </p><p>continue it through next year, along with Kuwait and the UAE. </p><p> (A top palace official told the Ambassador the Saudis had </p><p>already agreed to continue it through March 2003, but this </p><p>appears to be closely held.) </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  Even with this help, deficit reduction measures </p><p>equivalent to 1.3% of GDP (about JD 100 million) would still </p><p>need to be identified to meet the 2004 target.  Abu Hammour </p><p>said these will be achieved through continued price increases </p><p>for petroleum products, other tax increases and some spending </p><p>curtailment.  He admitted that a sitting Parliament would </p><p>make implementing such measures more politically complex than </p><p>in the past few years.  We hear that Marto will make a major </p><p>outreach campaign to new deputies to educate them on budget </p><p>realities and prepare the ground for the 2004 budget debate </p><p>that will take place in December. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Comment:  A Fragile Moment </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  After years of pessimism, a mood swing is welcome. </p><p>But we should welcome it as just that:  lack of sustained </p><p>progress on the road map and/or in stabilizing Iraq could </p><p>swing the public in the opposite direction very quickly. </p><p>There is also a complacency risk.  Improving the investment </p><p>climate so as to achieve the higher growth rates needed to </p><p>reduce unemployment and poverty will remain hard work.  New </p><p>Parliamentarians weary of years of fiscal austerity will make </p><p>this task more difficult for the King and his government. </p><p>Reducing poverty and unemployment remains Jordan\'s most </p><p>pressing economic and political challenge.  Funding for the </p><p>productivity enhancement projects under the Social and </p><p>Economic Transformation Program (SETP) will continue to </p><p>remain crucial for political stability and medium term </p><p>growth.  The embassy will continue to engage to maintain the </p><p>positive momentum.  Washington\'s continued focus and </p><p>engagement will also be critical in the months ahead. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
