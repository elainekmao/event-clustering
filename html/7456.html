<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001827 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASKFORCE, NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01:  UAE PRESIDENT ISSUES </p><p>STATEMENT ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In his first public statement since the </p><p>outbreak of Iraq hostilities, UAE President Shaykh </p><p>Zayid bin Sultan Al-Nahyan declared the UAE\'s </p><p>commitment to and solidarity with the people of </p><p>Iraq in remarks carried by all of the UAE\'s major </p><p>newspapers on 4/15.  Zayid reiterated the UAE\'s </p><p>support for Iraqi efforts to rebuild and regain </p><p>control of their country.  He also emphasized the </p><p>UAE\'s firm position on the need to protect Iraq\'s </p><p>sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as </p><p>the right for Iraqis to "determine their destiny </p><p>without foreign interference or trusteeship." </p><p>Zayid ordered the UAEG to redouble its efforts to </p><p>provide humanitarian assistance and instructed the </p><p>Armed Forces to set up a field hospital in Iraq </p><p>(see septel). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Zayid called upon Iraqis to set aside their </p><p>differences, "rise above hatred" and work together </p><p>in a spirit of unity and reconciliation.  He </p><p>recalled that the UAE had worked hard to prevent </p><p>the war.  In a reference to his initiative for </p><p>Saddam to step down, introduced and rejected at the </p><p>March 1 Arab League Summit, Zayid stated "we </p><p>addressed the former Iraqi leadership and offered </p><p>our advice to them, but they chose not to heed our </p><p>reason and were carried away by their pride." </p><p>Zayid regretted the deaths of Iraqi civilians as a </p><p>result of the conflict and the current state of </p><p>"chaos" gripping much of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Zayid emphasized the importance of the </p><p>United Nations in maintaining international </p><p>legitimacy, peace and security.  He urged the </p><p>members of the coalition to allow Iraqis to run </p><p>their affairs as soon as possible and looked </p><p>forward to a "healthy" Iraq that can "provide </p><p>freedom, pride and justice for all." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: Zayid\'s statement hits on all of </p><p>the themes the Emirati leadership has emphasized </p><p>privately with us since the crisis began.  The </p><p>plight of Iraqi civilians, the need to preserve </p><p>Iraq\'s territorial integrity (read:  Iranian and </p><p>Turkish ambitions) and the danger of an extended </p><p>U.S./coalition presence are all addressed.  Most of </p><p>all, however, Zayid\'s remarks were directed to the </p><p>UAE people who almost universally opposed the </p><p>conflict.  Zayid\'s reference to his initiative </p><p>reminds the public that the leadership, in the face </p><p>of regional opposition, did its utmost to avert the </p><p>conflict and put the blame squarely on Saddam.  He </p><p>signaled to his people that it is now time to move </p><p>in committing the UAE to building a new and better </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
