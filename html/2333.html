SUMMARY:  BOARDING SCHOOL EDUCATION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT </p><p>ROLE IN THE EFFORTS OF PHU THO AND TUYEN QUANG PROVINCES IN </p><p>NORTHERN VIETNAM TO INTEGRATE THEIR ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>POPULATIONS.  THE GVN SET UP BOARDING SCHOOLS NOT ONLY FOR </p><p>INTEGRATION, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY ARE MUCH CHEAPER TO BUILD </p><p>AND STAFF THAN THE ALTERNATIVE OF SETTING UP LOCAL SCHOOLS </p><p>IN REMOTE VILLAGES.  THE BOARDING SCHOOLS BRING SELECTED </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY STUDENTS TO MORE CENTRAL, BUT STILL SOMEWHAT </p><p>ISOLATED LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES.  THERE, IN </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE LANGUAGE, STUDENTS RECEIVE A RELATIVELY GOOD </p><p>EDUCATION AND EXPOSURE TO A DAILY PROGRAM THAT IS </p><p>CONSIDERABLY MORE INTENSIVE AND STRUCTURED THAN IS TYPICAL </p><p>FOR VIETNAMESE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.  GRADUATES OF THE </p><p>SCHOOLS HAVE BECOME, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOVERNMENT LEADERS, </p><p>PHYSICIANS, AND TEACHERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>WHY BOARDING SCHOOLS? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING AN OFFICIAL TRIP TO THE NORTHERN PROVINCES OF PHU </p><p>THO AND TUYEN QUANG PROVINCES NOVEMBER 27-29, POLOFF AND POL </p><p>FSN VISITED TWO BOARDING HIGH SCHOOLS FOR ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>STUDENTS.  PROVINCES WITH SIGNIFICANT MINORITY POPULATIONS </p><p>THROUGHOUT VIETNAM HAVE ESTABLISHED SECONDARY LEVEL BOARDING </p><p>SCHOOLS FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES.  VARIOUS OFFICIALS STRESSED </p><p>THAT MANY OF THE STUDENTS ATTENDING THE BOARDING SCHOOLS ARE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03302  01 OF 03  210733Z </p><p>FROM VILLAGES THAT CAN ONLY BE REACHED ON FOOT AND THAT </p><p>OFTEN DO NOT HAVE LOCAL SCHOOLS OR BASIC UTILITIES. </p><p>PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS ALSO DISCUSSED THE DIFFICULTY OF </p><p>GETTING TEACHERS TO WORK IN REMOTE SCHOOLS.  FEW ETHNIC </p><p>MAJORITY KINH TEACHERS ARE WILLING TO WORK IN THE MOUNTAINS </p><p>AND THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS FROM ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS IS </p><p>VERY SMALL, THEY ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>WHY GO TO A BOARDING SCHOOL? </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  SCHOOL AND PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO </p><p>THE GREAT COMPETITION TO ATTEND THESE BOARDING SCHOOLS. </p><p>THEY EXPLAINED THAT THE BOARDING SCHOOLS OFFER SEVERAL </p><p>ADVANTAGES.  FOREMOST, THEY SAID, IS THAT THE BOARDING </p><p>SCHOOLS MAY BE THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY THESE STUDENTS HAVE TO </p><p>ATTEND HIGH SCHOOL AT ALL.  MOREOVER, SCHOOL OFFICIALS </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE BOARDING SCHOOLS PROVIDE A BETTER EDUCATION </p><p>THAN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN DISTRICT TOWNS, THE OTHER </p><p>OPTION FOR SOME OF THESE STUDENTS.  PROVINCIAL AND SCHOOL </p><p>OFFICIALS ALSO EXPLAINED THAT ALLOWANCES PAID OUT OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL BUDGET PAY FOR TEXTBOOKS, SCHOOL SUPPLIES, BEDDING, </p><p>MOSQUITO NETS, AND CLOTHING.  FURTHERMORE, THE SCHOOLS </p><p>RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE OF VIETNAM DONG 120,000 PER STUDENT PER </p><p>MONTH, PRIMARILY FOR FOOD.  THE STUDENTS, SCHOOL OFFICIALS </p><p>SAID, MAY USE ANY LEFTOVER AMOUNT FOR DISCRETIONARY </p><p>SPENDING.  FINALLY, OFFICIALS ADDED, ALL STUDENTS RECEIVE AN </p><p>ALLOTMENT TO COVER THE COST OF TRAVELING TO AND FROM THEIR </p><p>HOME COMMUNITIES TWICE A YEAR.  OFFICIALS NOTED THAT, SINCE </p><p>MANY OF THESE STUDENTS ARE FROM VERY POOR FAMILIES, THERE </p><p>WAS NO WAY FOR THEM TO ATTEND SCHOOL WITHOUT THESE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03302  01 OF 03  210733Z </p><p>SUBSIDIES. </p><p> </p><p>HOW DO YOU GET IN? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  SCHOOL OFFICIALS EXPLAINED HOW STUDENTS WERE CHOSEN TO </p><p>ATTEND THE BOARDING SCHOOLS.  THE PHU THO SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL </p><p>HEADMASTER SAID THAT HIS STUDENTS WERE ALL GRADUATES OF THE </p><p>PROVINCE\'S BASIC SECONDARY LEVEL (JUNIOR HIGH) BOARDING </p><p>SCHOOL WHO HAD PASSED AN ENTRANCE EXAMINATION.  HE ADDED </p><p>THAT COMMUNE-LEVEL OFFICIALS CHOSE BASIC SECONDARY BOARDING </p><p>SCHOOL STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR "POTENTIAL."  TUYEN QUANG </p><p>OFFICIALS SAID THAT ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS WERE CHOSEN BY </p><p>EXAMINATION; 70 PERCENT OF THE INCOMING STUDENTS ARE FROM </p><p>THE PROVINCE\'S THREE BASIC SECONDARY BOARDING SCHOOLS AND 30 </p><p>PERCENT FROM THE REST OF THE PROVINCE\'S BASIC SECONDARY </p><p>SCHOOLS.  PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS REMARKED THAT COMPETITION TO </p><p>GET INTO THE SCHOOLS IS VERY KEEN. </p><p> </p><p>EDUCATION IN THE BOARDING SCHOOLS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  OFFICIALS SAID THE BOARDING SCHOOLS USE THE STANDARD </p><p>NATIONAL CURRICULUM AS WELL AS A PROGRAM OF EXTRACURRICULAR </p><p>ACTIVITIES DEFINED BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  TEACHERS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO HEADMASTERS, SUPERVISE STUDY AND </p><p>EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES WITH A DAILY SCHEDULE OF ACADEMIC </p><p>CLASSES IN THE MORNING AND SUPERVISED STUDY, PRACTICUMS, </p><p>SPORTS, AND CIVICS AND SOCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES IN THE </p><p>AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS.  OFFICIALS AT BOTH SCHOOLS ADMITTED </p><p>THAT THEY DO NOT ADD OR CHANGE ANY ACTIVITIES BASED ON LOCAL </p><p>CONDITIONS, NOR DID THEY EMPHASIZE THE STUDENTS\' VARIOUS </p><p>CULTURAL HERITAGES.  THEY HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>STUDENTS\' PARTICIPATION IN SOCIALIZATION AND CIVICS </p><p>ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO "INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE NATION."  IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\'S RECENT </p><p>DIRECTIVE TO USE LOCAL LANGUAGES IN SCHOOLS, TUYEN QUANG\'S </p><p>PROVINCIAL EDUCATION CHIEF SAID THAT VIETNAMESE HAD BEEN THE </p><p>SOLE MEANS OF INSTRUCTION IN ALL OF THE PROVINCE\'S SCHOOLS </p><p>SINCE THE 1970\'S AND THAT THERE WERE NO PLANS TO USE </p><p>MINORITY LANGUAGES AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>THE RESULTS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAID THAT THEIR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO </p><p>GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO CAN HELP THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND THAT </p><p>THEIR YARDSTICK IS THE NUMBER WHO GET INTO COLLEGE.  THE </p><p>HEADMASTER CLAIMED THAT ALMOST HALF OF TUYEN QUANG\'S </p><p>GRADUATES HAD GONE ON FOR FURTHER TRAINING AFTER THE SPRING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03302  02 OF 03  210734Z </p><p>2001 GRADUATION, WHEREAS HIS OPPOSITE NUMBER IN PHU THO </p><p>CLAIMED THAT ABOUT ONLY 15 PERCENT OF HIS HIGH SCHOOL </p><p>GRADUATES CONTINUED THEIR EDUCATION.  WHILE THE PHU THO </p><p>BOARDING HIGH SCHOOL HAD ONLY OPENED IN 1997, THE TUYEN </p><p>QUANG OFFICIALS NOTED THAT THEIR SCHOOL HAD BEEN OPEN SINCE </p><p>1959 AND THAT ITS CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF 4,465 GRADUATES NOW </p><p>INCLUDED ALMOST 50 MEDICAL DOCTORS AND DOCTORATE DEGREE </p><p>HOLDERS, SEVERAL PROVINCIAL PEOPLE COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN AND </p><p>VICE-CHAIRMEN, HEADS OF THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES, </p><p>AND MANY OF THE SCHOOLS\' CURRENT TEACHERS.  (NOTE:  ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES MAKE UP ABOUT HALF OF TUYEN QUANG\'S POPULATION </p><p>AND THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND VICE- </p><p>CHAIRMAN, THE PROVINCIAL EDUCATION CHIEF, AND A NUMBER OF </p><p>OTHER PROVINCIAL LEADERS ARE MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS. </p><p>MINORITIES COMPRISE ABOUT 2.5 PERCENT OF PHU THO\'S </p><p>POPULATION.  END NOTE.)   OFFICIALS SAID THAT GRADUATES WHO </p><p>DID NOT GO ON TO COLLEGE GENERALLY RETURNED TO AND WORKED IN </p><p>THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>LIFE AT THE SCHOOLS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  STUDENTS STAY AT THE SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE ACADEMIC </p><p>YEAR, ACCORDING TO SCHOOL OFFICIALS.  MOST ONLY RETURN HOME </p><p>DURING SUMMER VACATION AND AT TET, BECAUSE, THE HEADMASTERS </p><p>SAID, IT IS TOO TIME CONSUMING AND TOO EXPENSIVE TO GO HOME </p><p>MORE FREQUENTLY.  LIKEWISE, PARENTS VERY SELDOM VISIT.  THE </p><p>TEACHERS LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AROUND THE SCHOOLS AND </p><p>RECEIVE 30 PERCENT INCENTIVE PAY FOR TEACHING AT A BOARDING </p><p>SCHOOL, ACCORDING TO THE TUYEN QUANG SCHOOL HEADMASTER; </p><p>OTHER STAFF MEMBERS LIVE IN THE SCHOOLS WITH THE STUDENTS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03302  02 OF 03  210734Z </p><p>THE TUYEN QUANG HEADMASTER REMARKED THAT TEACHERS BECOME </p><p>SURROGATE PARENTS FOR THE STUDENTS.  SCHOOL AND PROVINCIAL </p><p>OFFICIALS EMPHASIZED THAT STUDENTS PRODUCE MUCH OF THEIR OWN </p><p>FOOD, BOTH TO MAKE THEIR MONTHLY ALLOWANCES GO FARTHER AND </p><p>TO PUT THEIR AGRICULTURE CLASSES INTO PRACTICE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  BOTH SCHOOLS ARE LOCATED 7 TO 10 KILOMETERS FROM THE </p><p>NEAREST DISTRICT TOWN ON SELF-CONTAINED CAMPUSES.  SCHOOL </p><p>OFFICIALS SAID THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LEAVE </p><p>CAMPUS.  PHU THO OFFICIALS SAID THEIR FACILITY USED TO BE A </p><p>COLLEGE FOR STUDENTS FROM LAOS.  AT BOTH SCHOOLS, EIGHT TO </p><p>TEN STUDENTS SHARED ONE DORMITORY ROOM, DOUBLING UP ON BUNK </p><p>BEDS.  THE EACH STUDENT HAD WOODEN LOCKER AND SOME ROOMS </p><p>WERE DECORATED WITH POSTERS.  ON THE DAY OF POLOFF\'S VISIT, </p><p>MOST STUDENTS IN THE TUYEN QUANG BOARDING SCHOOL APPEARED TO </p><p>BE DRESSED IN TRADITIONAL CLOTHING OF THEIR VARIOUS ETHNIC </p><p>GROUPS.  THEY ALSO CARRIED LENGTHS OF BAMBOO, DESCRIBED BY </p><p>ONE OFFICIAL AS "RIFLES" SINCE THE STUDENTS WERE IN MILITARY </p><p>TRAINING THAT WEEK.  STUDENTS AT THE PHU THO BOARDING SCHOOL </p><p>WERE CASUALLY DRESSED DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON HOUR OF </p><p>POLOFF\'S VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  THE BOARDING SCHOOLS REPRESENT A GOOD </p><p>EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR MINORITY STUDENTS AND PROVIDE </p><p>THE GVN A MEANS TO BOND THEM MORE CLOSELY TO THE CENTER. </p><p>THE GVN PAYS FOR NEARLY ALL OF THEIR EXPENSES AND ITS </p><p>EMPLOYEES BECOME THEIR SURROGATE PARENTS.  IF THE INTENTION </p><p>IS TO PRODUCE LOYAL AND INVOLVED CITIZENS, THEN THE APPARENT </p><p>HEAVY REPRESENTATION OF BOARDING SCHOOL ALUMNI IN THE RANKS </p><p>OF TUYEN QUANG\'S PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP SUGGESTS SUCCESS.  IT </p><p>IS LESS CLEAR, HOWEVER, WHAT CONTRIBUTION THESE SCHOOLS MAKE </p><p>IN PROMOTING OR MAINTAINING TRADITIONAL MINORITY CULTURES, </p><p>OR IN ENSURING THAT THE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION PAYS OFF FOR </p><p>THEIR OWN MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
