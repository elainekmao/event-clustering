(C) THE GOC IS REACTING TO IC PRESSURE ON REFUGEE RETURNS. </p><p> MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS AND RECONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING, </p><p>RADIMIR CACIC, HELD A HASTILY ARRANGED MEETING ON FEBRUARY 4 </p><p>WITH THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY TO PRESENT HIS MINISTRY,S </p><p>PROGRAM ON REFUGEE RETURN.  THE EVENT AT THE SHERATON HOTEL </p><p>WAS HEAVILY ATTENDED BY TELEVISION AND PRINT MEDIA.  THE </p><p>MINISTER WAS COMBATIVE.  MUCH OF WHAT CACIC SAID WAS OLD NEWS </p><p>AND FILLED WITH QUESTIONABLE FIGURES ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT,S </p><p>EFFORTS THUS FAR.  HE DID, HOWEVER, ANNOUNCE A NEW INITIATIVE </p><p>AIMED AT RESTORING LOST OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS.  HE </p><p>CHASTISED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR ITS LACK OF </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, CRITICIZED THE GOC </p><p>AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR ITS SHORTCOMINGS ON RETURN-RELATED </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MANY IC OFFICIALS AGREED THAT CACIC,S PRESENTATION </p><p>WAS LONG ON STYLE BUT SHORT ON SUBSTANCE.  THE HASTY EVENT </p><p>OBVIOUSLY WAS DESIGNED TO PUSH BACK STRONGER IC PRESSURE ON </p><p>THE GOC ON RETURNS.  THE GOC MISSED ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>CONVINCE THE IC THAT IT IS WILLING TO MAKE MEANINGFUL </p><p>PROGRESS ON RETURNS AND TO WORK WITH THE IC IN DOING SO. THAT </p><p>SAID, THE GOC\'S PUSHING BACK IS SOFTENING SOME IC RESOLVE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00337  01 OF 04  121720Z </p><p>NOTABLY THE OSCE HOM AND PERHAPS LOCAL COMMISSION REPS. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GOC LAYS OUT RED CARPET TREATMENT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN WHAT MANY IC OFFICIALS CONSIDERED AN UNUSUAL VENUE </p><p>TO HOLD A MEETING ON REFUGEE RETURNS, GOC OFFICIALS, LED BY </p><p>CACIC, HOSTED ALMOST ONE HUNDRED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY AT THE SHERATON HOTEL.  TELEVISION AND </p><p>PRINT MEDIA PRESENCE WAS EXTENSIVE.  CACIC USED THE OCCASION </p><p>TO REVIEW THE GOVERNMENT,S PERFORMANCE ON REFUGEE-RELATED </p><p>ISSUES SINCE COMING TO POWER IN 2000 AND TO HIGHLIGHT NEW GOC </p><p>PLANS TO ACCELERATE THE RETURN OF REFUGEES.  HE WANTED THIS </p><p>EVENT TO BE UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL AND ACTED MORE LIKE A </p><p>LECTURER THAN MINISTER.  HIS GOAL WAS TO SHOW THAT THE GOC </p><p>REGARDED THE ISSUE OF RETURNS WITH GREAT IMPORTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>CACIC:  I,M IN CHARGE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CACIC,S DEMEANOR THROUGHOUT THE PRESENTATION WAS </p><p>INTENDED TO DISPEL ANY NOTION THAT ANYONE ELSE BESIDE HIMSELF </p><p>WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR REFUGEE-RELATED MATTERS.  CACIC PRESENTED </p><p>HIS DEPUTY AND ASSISTANT MINISTERS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>REFUGEE RETURNS, BUT DID MOST OF THE TALKING.  HE ASSUMED </p><p>DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GOC,S RECORD ON RETURNS OVER </p><p>THE PAST THREE YEARS.  HE REMINDED THE AUDIENCE THAT HIS </p><p>MINISTRY WAS HAMPERED BY LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE PREVIOUS </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  ONLY LAST FALL WERE THE MOST CRUCIAL PARTS OF </p><p>THIS LEGISLATION AMENDED, WHICH, HE SAID, HELPED REMOVE ALL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00337  01 OF 04  121720Z </p><p>OF THE LEGISLATIVE BARRIERS TO RETURN.  HE SAID HE WAS NOT </p><p>SATISFIED WITH RESULTS TO DATE; HE QUESTIONED HIS ASSISTANT </p><p>MINISTERS ABOUT THE LACK OF PROGRESS AND FOUND MANY OF THEIR </p><p>RESPONSES TO BE UNACCEPTABLE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME OF </p><p>THEIR "JUSTIFICATIONS," AS HE REFERRED TO THEM, DEALT WITH </p><p>FINANCIAL AND RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT </p><p>WERE OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. </p><p>EU MEMBERSHIP AT STAKE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CACIC INSISTED THAT THE DISCONTENT IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REFLECTED A LACK OF INFORMATION.  HE </p><p>SAID HE INTENDS TO HAVE A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH THE IC TO </p><p>SHARE INFORMATION AND AVOID FUTURE MISUNDERSTANDINGS.  THIS </p><p>IS IMPORTANT, HE SAID, BECAUSE CROATIA WILL SOON SUBMIT ITS </p><p>APPLICATION TO JOIN THE EU AND CROATIA IS HELPED BY GETTING </p><p>MORE INFORMATION OUT.  HIS TOP PRIORITIES ARE RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>AND PROPERTY RETURNS.  SINCE 2000 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN </p><p>THE GOC,S ATTITUDE COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT, </p><p>CACIC SAID: THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HELPED ONLY ETHNIC CROATS </p><p>WHILE THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT HELPS ALL OF ITS CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>COOPERATION WITH IC PRODUCES MIXED RESULTS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE QUALITY OF COOPERATION WITH SOME IN THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9811 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00337  02 OF 04  121721Z </p><p>ACTION PRM-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  OIGO-00  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------352A9B  121738Z /38 </p><p>R 121719Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9449 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 ZAGREB 000337 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, OSCE, EUN, UNHCR, ECON, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: GOC PUSHING BACK ON IC CRITICISM ON RETURNS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00337  02 OF 04  121721Z </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS A SORE POINT FOR CACIC, AND AT </p><p>TIMES HE CONVEYED HIS FRUSTRATION.  HE EXPRESSED GRATITUDE </p><p>FOR THE EU-SPONSORED HOUSING PROGRAM BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE </p><p>GERMAN NGO ARBEITER-SAMARITER-BUND (ASB) AS HIS MINISTRY,S </p><p>KEY PARTNER IN HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS.  UNDER THIS </p><p>PROGRAM, ASB WILL RECONSTRUCT 1000 HOUSES.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND COUNTRIES, INCLUDING UNHCR, THE EU, </p><p>AND U.S., ARE PROVIDING IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO RETURNING </p><p>REFUGEES THROUGH THEIR VARIOUS PROGRAMS.  LOANS FROM </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ENABLED THE GOC TO </p><p>MAKE PROGRESS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.  YET, WHILE CACIC </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT HAS HAD A DIRECT </p><p>IMPACT, HE CLAIMED THE IC HAS SPENT ONLY ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT </p><p>OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT SPENT ON RECONSTRUCTION SINCE 1996. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) CACIC SAID HE EXPECTED GREATER UNHCR INVOLVEMENT </p><p>DURING WHAT HE SAID WOULD BE A CRITICAL YEAR FOR RETURNS (REF </p><p>A).  THIS WAS BECAUSE THREE-FOURTHS OF THE GOVERNMENT,S </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS WILL BENEFIT RETURNING SERBS.  HE SAID </p><p>HE REGRETTED THAT IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THE PROGRAMS TO HAVE A </p><p>DIRECT IMPACT ON THE SERB POPULATION.  THE GOC PLANS TO ISSUE </p><p>7,500 DECISIONS FOR RECONSTRUCTION THIS YEAR, WHICH WILL MAKE </p><p>IT POSSIBLE FOR AT LEAST 20,000 PEOPLE TO RETURN IF THEY </p><p>CHOOSE TO DO SO ONCE THEIR HOUSES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT SINCE SEPTEMBER 2002, ALMOST 940 PROPERTIES HAVE </p><p>BEEN REPOSSESSED.  THE GOC PLANS TO RETURN ALL HOMES TO THEIR </p><p>RIGHTFUL OWNERS BY THE END OF 2003. </p><p> </p><p>NEW INITIATIVE TO RESTORE TENANCY RIGHTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00337  02 OF 04  121721Z </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) CACIC,S DECLARATION THAT THE GOC WOULD SEEK TO </p><p>RESTORE LOST OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS SPARKED THE </p><p>GREATEST ATTENTION FROM HIS AUDIENCE.  HE SAID THAT IN THE </p><p>AREAS OF SPECIAL STATE CONCERN ("ASSC" -- WAR-AFFECTED AREAS) </p><p>ALL CITIZENS WERE VICTIMS OF THE WAR AND HAVE A RIGHT TO </p><p>RETURN, TO QUALIFY FOR HOUSING CARE AND TO PURCHASE THEIR </p><p>FORMER RIGHTS.  FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVED OUTSIDE THE ASSC (THAT </p><p>IS MOST FORMER OTR HOLDERS), THEY WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE </p><p>GOC,S PROGRAM ON PUBLICLY FUNDED HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.  A </p><p>NEW LAW WILL BE ENACTED THAT WILL CALL FOR THE FORMULATION OF </p><p>LISTS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF WHO CAN QUALIFY FOR SUCH </p><p>ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE MINISTER EXPLAINED, THERE WOULD </p><p>BE TWO POSSIBILITIES: OWNERSHIP AND RENT.  UNDER THE </p><p>OWNERSHIP PROGRAM, LOANS WILL BE OFFERED WHICH THE OWNERS </p><p>WILL HAVE TO REPAY OVER A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD.  THE RENT </p><p>PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT WILL ALLOW THE PERSON TO </p><p>PAY RENT FOR A REQUIRED PERIOD OF TIME, AFTER WHICH HE WILL </p><p>BECOME THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY.  CACIC ENVISIONED A 4-YEAR </p><p>PERIOD TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM.  FORMER TENANCY RIGHT </p><p>HOLDERS WILL BE GIVEN A ONE-YEAR DEADLINE TO APPLY AND 2 TO 3 </p><p>YEARS FOR THE PROPERTIES TO BE BUILT.  THE GOC WILL EARMARK </p><p>FUNDS FOR THE PROGRAM BY THE END OF THE YEAR, AND CACIC SAID </p><p>IT EXPECTS THE PROGRAM WILL BE COMPLETED BY 2006. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) CACIC PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE A HIGH NUMBER </p><p>OF APPLICATIONS FROM SERBS CURRENTLY LIVING IN </p><p>SERBIA-MONTENEGRO AND BIH.  THESE ARE THE POPULATIONS THE IC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00337  02 OF 04  121721Z </p><p>WANTED TO RETURN TO CROATIA.  MANY OF THE SERBS THAT WOULD </p><p>QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM DO NOT WANT TO RETURN TO CROATIA BUT </p><p>WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELL ANY PROPERTY PROVIDED TO THEM, </p><p>AN OUTCOME STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE GOC.   THE PROGRAM AS </p><p>OUTLINED BY CACIC IS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE WHO </p><p>REALLY WANT TO RETURN.  HE STATED THAT THE GOC DID NOT </p><p>CURRENTLY HAVE THE MONEY TO INITIATE THE PROGRAM BUT WOULD </p><p>RESOLVE THE FUNDING ISSUE SOON.  IT HAD TO IN ORDER TO </p><p>RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS ONCE AND </p><p>FOR ALL.  HE STRESSED THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL </p><p>THE PROPERTIES OBTAINED THROUGH THE PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTIOUS QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) A BRIEF QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD FOLLOWED CACIC,S </p><p>REMARKS.  THE MINISTER BECAME IRRITATED AND CONFRONTATIONAL </p><p>WHEN OSCE HEAD PETER SEMNEBY ASKED FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION </p><p>ABOUT THE TENANCY RIGHTS INITIATIVE, NOTABLY WHEN WOULD THE </p><p>ONE-YEAR DEADLINE BEGIN FOR FORMER TENANCY RIGHTS HOLDERS. </p><p>CACIC RESPONDED THAT HE WOULD WAIT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO TELL HIM WHAT TO DO.  THIS WAY, THE IC COULD NOT </p><p>SAY THAT THE GOC SET A SHORT DEADLINE THAT WAS DISCRIMINATORY </p><p>AGAINST SERBS WHO DID NOT RESIDE IN CROATIA.  CACIC SAID HE </p><p>WOULD SIGN ANY PROPOSAL THE IC SUBMITTED TO HIM, BUT THEN HE </p><p>DID NOT WANT TO HEAR COMPLAINTS AFTERWARDS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9815 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00337  03 OF 04  121721Z </p><p>ACTION PRM-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  OIGO-00  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------352AB9  121739Z /38 </p><p>R 121719Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9450 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 ZAGREB 000337 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, OSCE, EUN, UNHCR, ECON, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: GOC PUSHING BACK ON IC CRITICISM ON RETURNS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00337  03 OF 04  121721Z </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) OTHER LEADING IC REPS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT RENTAL </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR CURRENT OWNERS WHO ARE NOT OCCUPYING THEIR </p><p>PROPERTIES AND FOR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE LOOTING OF </p><p>PROPERTIES BY TEMPORARY OCCUPANTS AS THEY VACATE THEM.  CACIC </p><p>REPLIED THAT THE GOC WILL PROVIDE RENTAL COMPENSATION TO </p><p>THOSE WHO QUALIFY UNDER THE LAW BUT HE DID NOT SAY WHEN IT </p><p>WOULD BEGIN.  AS FOR LOOTING, CACIC SAID THE GOC DID NOT HAVE </p><p>THE MONEY TO COMPENSATE EVERYONE WHOSE PROPERTY HAD BEEN </p><p>LOOTED.  HE EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT CROATIA WAS BEING ASKED </p><p>TO PROVIDE SUCH COMPENSATION WHEN NO OTHER COUNTRY IN THE </p><p>REGION WAS ASKED TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>INCREASING THE STAKES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) IC PRESSURE ON THE GOC TO STEP UP TO THE RETURNS </p><p>ISSUE HAS INCREASED RECENTLY IN WAYS IT APPARENTLY CANNOT </p><p>IGNORE.  WE NEED TO JUDGE THE GOC BY ITS ACTIONS AND BY </p><p>RESULTS ON THE GROUND, NOT BY RHETORIC OR DECLARATIONS.  SO </p><p>FAR, WHAT IS CLEAR -- CACIC\'S PERSONAL LEAD MADE THIS CLEAR </p><p>-- IS THAT MORE CAREFULLY "MANAGING" THE RETURNS ISSUE WITH </p><p>THE IC IS PART OF THE GOC\'S EFFORT TO MAINTAIN MOMENTUM </p><p>TOWARD THE EU AND NATO.  IT WAS LESS OBVIOUS THAT ACTUALLY </p><p>SOLVING THIS BIG PROBLEM IS ON THE GOC\'S AGENDA -- MOST OF </p><p>WHAT CACIC TALKED ABOUT WAS EITHER OLD HAT TO THOSE WHO WORK </p><p>THESE ISSUES OR INSUFFICIENTLY DETAILED TO BE GROUNDS FOR </p><p>CONFIDENCE THAT THE GOC IS TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) THIS EVENT WAS ONLY THE LATEST SIGN THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00337  03 OF 04  121721Z </p><p>INCREASED IC PRESSURE IS REACHING AND RESONATING AT THE </p><p>HIGHEST GOC LEVELS, AND THAT THE GOC KNOWS THE STAKES HAVE </p><p>INCREASED.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PLAN TO ADDRESS THE </p><p>OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS PROBLEM IS PROOF OF THAT; THE </p><p>ISSUE HAS LANGUISHED SINCE THE IC RAISED IT, TO LITTLE </p><p>EFFECT, WITH PM RACAN IN DECEMBER 2001.  ON ITS FACE, CACIC\'S </p><p>PLAN WOULD REPRESENT A REAL STEP FORWARD, BUT THE SHORTFALL </p><p>HERE ALWAYS IS IMPLEMENTATION AND WE WILL BE WATCHING </p><p>CAREFULLY.  CACIC\'S PRESENTATION LEFT US NO MORE CONVINCED </p><p>THAN BEFORE THAT THE GOC HAS ANY REAL DESIRE, WILL OR INTENT </p><p>TO ACT ON RETURNS ISSUES ESPECIALLY IN THIS ELECTION YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>...BUT OSCE/EU WAVERING </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) THAT SAID, GOC PUSH BACK FOLLOWING THE IC PRINCIPALS </p><p>JANUARY 23 LETTER TO PM RACAN SUSPENDING PARTICIPATING IN THE </p><p>JOINT LEGAL WORKING GROUP IS HAVING AN IMPACT.  OSCE HOM </p><p>SEMNEBY WAS QUICK, AND AT PAINS, TO PUT OUT A BEST-CASE </p><p>LAUDATORY PRESS RELEASE ON CACIC\'S ANNOUNCED OCCUPANCY AND </p><p>TENANCY RIGHTS PLAN.  SEMNEBY ALSO PULLED EVERY CONCEIVABLE </p><p>PUNCH IN AN EXCESSIVELY POSITIVE BRIEFING ON THESE ISSUES TO </p><p>THE EU WESTERN BALKANS WORKING GROUP (COWEB) IN BRUSSELS </p><p>FEBRUARY 6.  YET AGAIN IN AN IC PANEL BRIEFING FOR A VISITING </p><p>OSCE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION FEBRUARY 10, SEMNEBY TOOK A </p><p>NOTABLY SOFTER LINE ON THE GOC THAN DID UNHCR, THE UN LIAISON </p><p>OFFICE OR OUR OWN EMBASSY PARTICIPANT.  IT IS CLEAR TO US AND </p><p>TO SEMNEBY\'S AMERICAN DEPUTY HOM (PROTECT) THAT SEMNEBY IS </p><p>GETTING COLD FEET OUT OF FEAR THAT THE OSCE-GOC RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WILL SOUR AND HE WILL END UP COLD-SHOULDERED AND VILIFIED </p><p>LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR BERNARD PONCET.  THAT COULD HAPPEN, BUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00337  03 OF 04  121721Z </p><p>IF SO IT WOULD BE OF LIMITED IMPORT FOR REAL IC INTERESTS </p><p>HERE.  THE OSCE MISSION IS LIKE UNMOVIC -- IF THE HOST </p><p>COUNTRY REJECTS AND OBSTRUCTS PEOPLE WHO CAN ONLY HELP IT </p><p>RESOLVE ISSUES OF INTERNATIONAL CONCERN, BUT NOT ENFORCE, ITS </p><p>VALUE DISAPPEARS AND IT COULD AS EASILY GO AWAY.  WE ARE </p><p>CONVEYING TO THE OSCE MISSION AND TO SEMNEBY THAT WHILE WE </p><p>WANT THEM TO TRY TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE GOC, </p><p>THEY WILL NOT HAVE OUR SUPPORT IF THEY LOSE FOCUS AND </p><p>SACRIFICE BASIC PRINCIPLES IN THE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) OF PERHAPS MORE CONCERN ARE INDICATIONS THAT EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMISSION PRESSURE ALSO PEAKED LAST MONTH WITH THEIR ACTIVE </p><p>SUPPORT FOR SUSPENDING THE JOINT LEGAL WORKING GROUP. THE </p><p>COMMISSION DEPUTY HEAD JOINED SEMNEBY IN SOFT-PEDALING </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE GOC AT THE OSCE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION </p><p>BRIEFING.
