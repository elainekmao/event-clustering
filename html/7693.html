<p>S E C R E T ABU DHABI 002013 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/26/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, EAID, SA, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAQI SUNNI IMAM AL-KUBAYSI STIRS </p><p>STRONG POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS </p><p>AMONGST EMIRATIS AND IRAQI EXPATS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) Dubai 1523; B) Riyadh 2221 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Ahmed Al-Kubaysi the Iraqi Sunni Imam who </p><p>delivered a fiery sermon in Baghdad on April 18, </p><p>continues to be a source of controversy even in the </p><p>UAE, his adopted land.  We received two very </p><p>different takes on Al-Kubaysi, one from a prominent </p><p>Emirati NGO head and another from a formerly well- </p><p>connected Iraqi government official.  Their </p><p>comments have separately been echoed by others in </p><p>the UAE, highlighting the fact that while Al- </p><p>Kubaysi has his admirers, particularly in UAE </p><p>official circles (ref A), he also has his share of </p><p>detractors. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) UAE Jurists\' Association Chairman Dr. </p><p>Muhammad Al-Rukn -- in a meeting with Polchief and </p><p>Poloff -- praised Al-Kubaysi, noting that the Iraqi </p><p>preacher\'s strong connections to the Dubai Al- </p><p>Maktoum ruling family had resulted in his being </p><p>granted Emirati citizenship.  Al-Rukn, himself a </p><p>conservative Sunni, reported that Al-Kubaysi is </p><p>also tied to the Saudis (NFI), having studied in </p><p>Riyadh in the early 1980s.  After leaving Iraq in </p><p>the mid-1990s, Al-Kubaysi took up residency in </p><p>Dubai where he became a key advisor on religious </p><p>matters to the Dubai government and a regular on </p><p>Dubai TV\'s weekly religious affairs program. </p><p>According to Al-Rukn, the Iraqi cleric, an expert </p><p>in the application of Shari\'a law, played a role in </p><p>the drafting of the UAE\'s personal status law (yet </p><p>to be finalized). </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Dr. Ala\'a Al-Tameemi (strictly protect), a </p><p>former high ranking official in the Iraqi Ministry </p><p>of Industry and Trade and resident in the UAE since </p><p>the mid-1990s, told Polchief that in his view, Al- </p><p>Kubaysi was a dangerous, divisive figure and </p><p>nothing more than a stalking horse for the Saudis </p><p>and Emiratis, both of whom fear a Shi\'a power grab. </p><p>Al-Tameemi, also a Sunni, dismissed out of hand the </p><p>rationale that Al-Kubaysi was trying to bridge </p><p>Sunni-Shi\'a differences, noting that Al-Kubaysi\'s </p><p>real goal was to keep the Shi\'a in their box and </p><p>that he was coordinating closely with the Saudis in </p><p>this regard.  According to Al-Tameemi, Al-Kubaysi, </p><p>despite the "cover story" of fleeing Iraq in fear </p><p>of Saddam, was in fact a "well known" Iraqi agent; </p><p>Al-Tameemi went so far as to allege that Al-Kubaysi </p><p>was "mukhabarat," i.e. an Iraqi intelligence agent. </p><p>As proof, Al-Tameemi pointed to the fact that the </p><p>Iraqi cleric had traveled back to Iraq on numerous </p><p>occasions in the past few years, mostly as a member </p><p>of UAE official delegations.  Al-Tameemi recalled </p><p>that Al-Kubaysi had, just a few weeks before the </p><p>onset of Operation Iraqi Freedom, appeared on the </p><p>Al-Jazeera program "Shari\'a wal Hayat" during which </p><p>he blasted the U.S. and compared Saddam Hussein to </p><p>the Imam Hussein, hardly the actions of a Saddam </p><p>oppositionist, in Al-Tameemi\'s view. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
