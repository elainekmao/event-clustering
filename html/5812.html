<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000338 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, IZ, AL, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMENI FOREIGN MINISTER ON IRAQ AND THE ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE MINISTERIAL IN CAIRO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting Pol/Econ Chief Catherine J. Westley for Reason 1. </p><p>5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  The Iraq situation and the recent Arab </p><p>League ministerial were discussed when the Ambassador called </p><p>on Foreign Minister Qirbi on February 18.  Notably, according </p><p>to Qirbi the Yemenis and other Arab countries did not buy </p><p>into the French proposals on inspections, despite their </p><p>appreciation for the French and German stances against </p><p>military action.  Yemen\'s missile cooperation with North </p><p>Korea and other matters were also discussed during the </p><p>meeting (septels).  Also present at the meeting were MFA </p><p>Advisor al-Iryani, DCM, DATT and Acting Pol/Econ Chief </p><p>(notetaker).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)   While giving the Foreign Minister a readout of his </p><p>recent Washington consultations, the Ambassador said that </p><p>there is total commitment on the part of the USG that Iraq </p><p>must disarm.  He also noted that there is a preference for </p><p>working through the UNSC and the international community, but </p><p>that at the end of the day Iraq must disarm. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Qirbi gave a readout of the recent Cairo meeting of </p><p>Arab League foreign ministers.  He said that they heard from </p><p>the Saudis, the Syrians, the Iraqis, and that there is </p><p>"nothing new" as far as the sequence of events is concerned. </p><p>He said that the "striking issue" was the degree of Iraqi </p><p>cooperation and its stated commitment to answer questions </p><p>from the inspectors and eliminate WMD.  Qirbi opined that </p><p>what Iraq said may or may not be correct, but if it is </p><p>correct, they are moving in the right direction. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Qirbi said that the Arab delegations urged Iraq to </p><p>"abide by and implement" UNSCR 1441 in its entirety.  He </p><p>noted that there was unanimous opposition to military action </p><p>unless all peaceful means of resolving the problem are </p><p>exhausted.  He said that until there is a clear statement </p><p>from the inspectors that Iraq is not cooperating, those </p><p>peaceful means remain open.  However, he mentioned the </p><p>possibility that time limits might be imposed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Qirbi said the French and German positions against </p><p>military action were appreciated, but that the ROYG and most </p><p>Arab states do not/not agree with their proposals regarding </p><p>inspectors.  He suggested that the Arab delegations are </p><p>mindful of not taking advantage of the split between the </p><p>French and German governments and the U.S. and other European </p><p>governments.  Rather, the Arab position would be to pressure </p><p>Iraq toward an outcome acceptable to both France and the </p><p>U.S., meaning both no war and complete disarmament. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The Ambassador said it was useful for the AL member </p><p>states to be clear on Iraq\'s responsibilities to disarm.  The </p><p>Ambassador mentioned specifics from Secretary Powell\'s </p><p>February 14 UNSC speech, and noted that time will tell if </p><p>Iraq does decide to change its course and disarm.  Qirbi said </p><p>that the U.S. has a major responsibility to support the </p><p>inspectors (read: through intelligence provision). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Ambassador Hull stressed the need to sustain </p><p>pressure on Baghdad.  Even Iraq\'s recent participation in the </p><p>Tripartite Committee on Gulf War missing was solely the </p><p>result of international pressure, as Iraq had long boycotted </p><p>the meetings.  Still, Iraq refuses to account for Kuwaiti </p><p>missing.  Saddam Hussein responds to pressure and nothing </p><p>else, said the Ambassador.  Qirbi nodded in agreement, </p><p>acknowledging that Yemen\'s own diplomatic efforts to resolve </p><p>this problem were fruitless as a result of Iraqi </p><p>intransigence. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  FM Qirbi agreed that all should continue to pressure </p><p>Iraq, but added that pressure needs to also be placed on the </p><p>U.S. and its allies not to be hasty in the use of military </p><p>force. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Comment:  It is notable that the Yemenis and other </p><p>Arab states did not buy the French proposal on inspections. </p><p>The French Ambassador told Ambassador Hull on February 17 </p><p>that Paris had tasked him with demarching on the proposals </p><p>throughout the Eid holiday.  Apparently his efforts did not </p><p>influence the Yemeni position.  End Comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
