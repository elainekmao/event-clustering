<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002228 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR GARY PETERS, JUSTICE FOR OPDAT, TREASURY FOR OTA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, KCRM, KTIA, PREL, PTER, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO REQUEST ON COUNTERRORISM LEGISLATION </p><p>SEMINARS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 51937 B. AMMAN 5049-01 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) In response to Ref A, Post has queried and received a </p><p>positive response from the FonMin\'s office on the GOJ\'s </p><p>interest in attending counterterrorism legislation seminars </p><p>in Washington.  The GOJ is one of our strongest partners in </p><p>the war on terrorism and we believe the opportunity to </p><p>further develop their legislative tools on key </p><p>counterterrorism issues would be invaluable.  Post has </p><p>identified the following areas in which we believe the GOJ </p><p>would benefit from training: terrorist financing, border </p><p>control and immigration, export and import controls, and </p><p>investigative and prosecution tools for counterterrorism </p><p>offenses. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The following answers are keyed to Ref A questions on </p><p>the GOJ\'s legal system: </p><p> </p><p>A. The GOJ legal system is an amalgam of several legal models </p><p>reflecting the influences of colonial and regional powers </p><p>prominent in the last century.  It is essentially a </p><p>code-based legal system that derives its normative and </p><p>procedural structure primarily from Egyptian codes, which </p><p>themselves were based on the French tradition and models of </p><p>the 19th and 20th centuries. The GOJ legal system also </p><p>incorporates Shari\'a (Islamic law) and some aspects of </p><p>European law.  For example, during the Ottoman period, </p><p>aspects of French commercial law and civil and criminal </p><p>procedures were adopted.  English common law was introduced </p><p>in the West Bank between 1917 and 1948, and was introduced in </p><p>the East Bank during the years 1921-1946, when the East Bank </p><p>comprised the British Mandate of Transjordan. </p><p> </p><p>B. Yes, codified in the penal code. </p><p> </p><p>C. Yes, per Ref B, the GOJ in October 2001 passed a series of </p><p>amendments to its penal code that broadly define terrorism </p><p>and punishments for terrorism-related crimes. </p><p> </p><p>D. Yes, as a condition of the FY 2001 cash transfer program, </p><p>the U.S. required the GOJ to draft statutes on money </p><p>laundering.  The GOJ statutes are based on the "forty </p><p>recommendations"--the general framework of the Financial </p><p>Action Task Force of the OECD. </p><p> </p><p>E. Yes, conditional on the approval of the Prosecutor </p><p>General.  If approval has not been given, evidence garnered </p><p>from such operations will not be allowed to be presented in </p><p>court. </p><p> </p><p>G. Yes, conditional on the approval of the Prosecutor </p><p>General.  If approval is not given, evidence garnered from </p><p>such surveillance cannot be presented in court. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
