<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 004200 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/09/09 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SY </p><p>SUBJECT: BASHAR\'S INTRO TO THE WEST? </p><p>         U.S. VIEW OF BASHAR IMPORTANT TO ASAD </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) DAMASCUS 4043, B) DAMASCUS 0997 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RYAN C. CROCKER, REASON 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  A SOURCE CLOSE TO BASHAR AL-ASAD TOLD </p><p>US AUGUST 5 THAT PRESIDENT ASAD HAD APPROVED A MIDDLE </p><p>EAST INSIGHT MAGAZINE INTERVIEW WITH BASHAR, SCHEDULED </p><p>TO BE PUBLISHED IN SEPTEMBER.  THE SAME SOURCE, A BASHAR </p><p>LOYALIST, PROBED US ON HOW THE U.S. VIEWED THE HEIR- </p><p>APPARENT AND SEEMED INTENT ON HEARING ABOUT HOW TO </p><p>IMPROVE BASHAR\'S IMAGE WITH THE U.S.  IF THE INTERVIEW </p><p>COMES OFF, IT MAY SIGNAL THE BEGINNING OF A SARG- </p><p>ORCHESTRATED "SELL JOB" OF BASHAR TO THE WEST, AND TO </p><p>THE U.S. IN PARTICULAR.  MEANWHILE, RUMORS INDICATE THAT </p><p>BASHAR STILL FACES SOME INTERNAL OBSTACLES, POSSIBLY </p><p>AMONG ALAWIS.  WE SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF OUR POSTURE ON BASHAR IN THE MONTHS TO </p><p>COME.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MEI INTERVIEW WITH BASHAR? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AN AMERICAN-BASED, SYRIAN BUSINESSMAN WITH CLOSE </p><p>TIES TO BASHAR AL-ASAD TOLD US AUGUST 5 THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>ASAD HAD GIVEN HIS APPROVAL FOR BASHAR TO BE INTERVIEWED </p><p>BY MIDDLE EAST INSIGHT (MEI) MAGAZINE, FOR THE SEPTEMBER </p><p>ISSUE.  THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST INTERVIEW GRANTED BY </p><p>BASHAR TO A WESTERN PUBLICATION, ALTHOUGH A LENGTHY </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH THE LEBANESE NEWSPAPER AL-KIFAH AL-\'ARABI </p><p>APPEARED IN FEBRUARY (REF B).  ACCORDING TO THIS </p><p>BUSINESS CONTACT, WHO STATED CREDIBLY THAT HE HAD MET </p><p>WITH BASHAR DURING THE PRECEEDING WEEK, IT HAD BEEN </p><p>AGREED WITH MEI THAT THE QUESTIONS WOULD BE SUBMITTED IN </p><p>ADVANCE AND THAT THE INTERVIEW WOULD BE APPROVED BY THE </p><p>SARG BEFORE ITS PUBLICATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THIS CONTACT, A BASHAR LOYALIST WHO SAYS HE WOULD </p><p>RETURN TO WORK FOR THE SARG UNDER BASHAR\'S DIRECTION, </p><p>SAID THAT ASAD IS LOOKING FOR "CERTAIN CONTROLLED </p><p>ENVIRONMENTS" IN WHICH TO INCREASE HIS SON\'S EXPOSURE </p><p>AND STATURE.  WHILE THIS CONTACT REMAINS CONCERNED THAT </p><p>SYRIA LACKS THE FORWARD-THINKING TECHNO-AND BUREAUCRATS </p><p>NEEDED TO EFFECT CHANGE HERE (REF A), HE SEEMS CONVINCED </p><p>THAT BASHAR PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TOWARDS A MORE </p><p>OPEN AND EFFICIENT SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>BASHAR NEEDS U.S. BLESSING </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DURING OUR EXCHANGE, THIS CONTACT ASKED AS </p><p>BLATANTLY AS WE HAVE HEARD THUS FAR HOW THE U.S. VIEWED </p><p>BASHAR, AND ASKED FOR OUR ADVICE ON WAYS BASHAR\'S IMAGE </p><p>COULD BE PROMOTED IN THE U.S.  WE ANSWERED THAT A </p><p>CONSIDERED OPINION WAS IMPOSSIBLE SINCE FEW AMERICANS </p><p>HAD EVER MET HIM, MUCH LESS EVALUATED HIM AS A FUTURE </p><p>PRESIDENT.  HE ASKED FOR OUR OPINION ON THE UPCOMING MEI </p><p>INTERVIEW, WHICH WE SAID WOULD BE USEFUL (AS WALID </p><p>MU\'ALLIM\'S HAD BEEN) IF IT PROVIDED "REAL QUESTIONS AND </p><p>REAL ANSWERS," AND NOT OBVIOUSLY PRE-PACKAGED </p><p>STATEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>A LEGITIMACY "VACUUM" </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) SEVERAL PRO-BASHAR AND/OR U.S-LEANING </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS HAVE INQUIRED MORE SUBTLY THAN THIS </p><p>ARTICULATE BUSINESS CONTACT ABOUT U.S. VIEWS TOWARD THE </p><p>HEIR APPARENT, APPARENTLY LOOKING FOR POSITIVE SIGNALS </p><p>FROM US ABOUT OUR FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.  A </p><p>FORMER MP WHO MAINTAINS REGULAR CONTACT WITH US AND THE </p><p>BRITISH EMBASSY EXPANDED ON THE THEME IN A RECENT </p><p>CONVERSATION.  HE SAID THE REGIME IS CLEARLY WORRIED </p><p>ABOUT A "VACUUM IN LEGITIMACY" AFTER AN ANTICIPATED </p><p>PEACE AGREEMENT WITH ISRAEL, SINCE SO MUCH OF ASAD\'S </p><p>INTERNAL AUTHORITY AND INTERNATIONAL STANDING STEMS FROM </p><p>THE CONFLICT WITH ISRAEL.  IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS </p><p>CRUTCH, ASAD IS INTENT ON SECURING FOR BASHAR THE KIND </p><p>OF SUPPORT THAT JORDANIAN KING ABDULLAH RECEIVED FROM </p><p>THE U.S. AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER.  SUCH SUPPORT </p><p>WOULD WIN FINANCIAL GAINS, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY FOR THE NEW BASHAR REGIME, </p><p>AMELIORATING BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>STILL LACKING SOME CREDENTIALS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) MEANWHILE, CONTACTS INDICATE WITHOUT ELABORATING </p><p>THAT BASHAR STILL FACES SOME RESISTANCE AMONG THE ALAWI </p><p>ELITE, SOME OF WHOM DOUBT THAT BASHAR IS CAPABLE OF </p><p>MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM THAT HAS LONG BENEFITED THIS </p><p>RULING MINORITY. (INTERESTINGLY, CHRISTIANS AND MOST </p><p>OTHER RELIGIOUS MINORITIES HAVE EXPRESSED OPEN SUPPORT </p><p>FOR BASHAR IN THE FERVENT HOPE THAT HE WILL MAINTAIN </p><p>ASAD\'S "LIVE AND LET LIVE" APPROACH TOWARDS MINORITY </p><p>RELIGIOUS GROUPS.)  WHILE IT IS NO LONGER TABOO TO SPEAK </p><p>OPENLY ABOUT BASHAR AS A SUCCESSOR TO HIS FATHER, EVEN </p><p>SUPPORTERS FRET THAT HE STILL LACKS A TITLE AND AN </p><p>OFFICIAL PLACE IN THE GOVERNMENT/PARTY STRUCTURE.  THE </p><p>COMMON WISDOM IS THAT A REGIONAL COMMAND MEETING </p><p>SOMETIME IN THE FALL WILL FINALLY ELECT BASHAR INTO THE </p><p>BA\'TH PARTY LEADERSHIP, BUT PREPARATIONS FOR SUCH A </p><p>MEETING ARE STILL NOTICEABLY ABSENT.  WE NOTE AS WELL </p><p>THE PERSISTENT RUMORS THAT BASHAR HAS NOT LIVED UP TO </p><p>EXPECTATIONS WITH HIS HANDLING OF THE LEBANON FILE, AND </p><p>THAT VP KHADDAM IS STILL PERFORMING HIS TRADITIONAL ROLE </p><p>AS ARBITER AMONG THE LEBANESE LEADERSHIP.  FINALLY, IT </p><p>IS CLEAR THAT BASHAR CONTINUES TO BE EXCLUDED FROM PEACE </p><p>PROCESS RELATED ACTIVITY, WHICH REMAINS AN ASAD-SHARA </p><p>AFFAIR. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) OTHER RESISTANCE MAY COME FROM BA\'TH PARTY </p><p>STALWARTS GENERALLY UNHAPPY WITH SIGNS OF CHANGE IN </p><p>SYRIA AND ASAD\'S DECISION TO PURSUE PEACE.  A MEMBER OF </p><p>THE COMMUNIST PARTY POLITBURO CLAIMED THAT IN A RECENT </p><p>MEETING WITH THE NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE FRONT, WHICH HE </p><p>ATTENDED, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE BA\'TH PARTY </p><p>REGIONAL COMMAND DR. SULAYMAN QADDAH MADE OPENLY </p><p>CRITICAL REMARKS ABOUT THE PEACE PROCESS AND EVEN SPOKE </p><p>RHETORICALLY ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL.  WHILE </p><p>THIS FORMER MP AGREED THAT THIS SENTIMENT WOULD NEVER </p><p>STAND IN THE WAY OF ASAD\'S DESIRE TO CONCLUDE A PEACE </p><p>WITH ISRAEL, HE SAID SUCH COMMENTS REFLECTED A CERTAIN </p><p>ELEMENT OF "OLD THINK" THAT WAS RELUCTANT TO EMBRACE </p><p>FORWARD MOVEMENT, EVEN WITH BASHAR. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT.  IF THE MEI INTERVIEW COMES OFF, IT WILL </p><p>MARK BASHAR\'S MEDIA INTRODUCTION TO THE WEST, A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT IN ITSELF SINCE FEW OFFICIAL </p><p>SYRIANS ARE ALLOWED SUCH ENTREE.  WHILE IT MAY SIGNAL </p><p>THE BEGINNING OF A SARG-ORCHESTRATED EFFORT TO "SELL" </p><p>BASHAR TO THE WEST, AND THE UNITED STATES IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>IT IS LIKELY TO BE A HIGHLY STRUCTURED AND CONTROLLED </p><p>EFFORT.  SOME OBSERVERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT IF THE U.S. </p><p>GIVES BASHAR (AND A NEW MINORITY ALAWI REGIME) ITS </p><p>BLESSING, "ASAD WILL SIGN WITH ISRAEL TOMORROW."  WHILE </p><p>THIS LINKAGE IS TOO BOLD, WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE </p><p>HOW IMPORTANT OUR POSTURE TOWARDS BASHAR IS LIKELY TO </p><p>BE, IN INCREASING MEASURE, IN THE MONTHS TO COME. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THUS FAR, THE BASHAR CAMPAIGN DOES NOT INCLUDE </p><p>ACTUAL CONTACT WITH AMERICAN OFFICIALS; THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>NO RESPONSE TO REQUESTS BY THE AMBASSADOR AND A NUMBER </p><p>OF CODELS FOR MEETINGS.  OUR WESTERN DIPLOMATIC </p><p>COLLEAGUES HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE, PRESUMABLY </p><p>BECAUSE ASAD DOES NOT WANT POSSIBLY LESS-THAN-EFFUSIVE </p><p>ASSESSMENTS TO REACH WORLD CAPITALS.  FOR NOW, </p><p>THEREFORE, THE ANSWER TO PROBES ABOUT OUR VIEW IS </p><p>SIMPLE: </p><p> </p><p>--THE USG HAS HAD NO CONTACT WITH BASHAR AL-ASAD. </p><p> </p><p>--DECISIONS ON LEADERSHIP IN SYRIA ARE FOR SYRIANS TO </p><p>MAKE, NOT AMERICANS. </p><p> </p><p>CROCKER </p><p></p></div>
