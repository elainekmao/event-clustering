<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005173 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR TUCKER ASKEW </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: OUTSPOKEN JORDANIAN MP SAYS IRAQIS DON\'T LIKE </p><p>SADDAM, BUT WOULD FIGHT FOR HIM IF FACED WITH A U.S. </p><p>INVASION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Douglas A. Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In a recent rambling conversation with A/DCM, </p><p>Mahmoud Kharabsheh (please protect), an outspoken former </p><p>Jordan MP and former provincial intelligence chief, said that </p><p>most average Iraqis would not/not support a U.S. military </p><p>strike on Iraq aimed at overthrowing the regime.  He said </p><p>that, based on monthly trips into Iraq for business </p><p>negotiations and conversations with "Iraqi friends" in </p><p>Jordan, most Iraqis do not like Saddam Hussein or the </p><p>"Tikriti regime," and would be very happy to see the </p><p>government fall and Saddam leave the scene.  He claimed, </p><p>however, that all the Iraqis with whom he had spoken had had </p><p>a viscerally negative reaction to the possibility of a U.S. </p><p>invasion, even if the purpose of the strike was to change the </p><p>regime.  Kharabsheh claimed that several of his business </p><p>contacts pledged that they would pick up arms and fight any </p><p>U.S. assault.  Kharabsheh speculated that his Iraqi contacts </p><p>felt that the "dishonor" of possible foreign military </p><p>intervention was worse than the continuation of the current </p><p>"brutal" Iraqi regime. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  In addition, Kharabsheh continued, U.S. Military </p><p>action against Iraq would solidify the "strong and growing" </p><p>feeling of anti-Americanism in the Arab street.  "If you </p><p>invade Iraq," he argued forcefully, "you will create a new </p><p>generation of (anti-American) mujaheddin (holy warriors), </p><p>just the way you did fighting (the Soviets) in Afghanistan." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COMMENT:  Based on previous conversations, we know </p><p>Kharabsheh to be personally opposed to U.S. military action </p><p>against Iraq, and he almost certainly exaggerated his </p><p>arguments to make a rhetorical point.  Nonetheless, both of </p><p>his points -- that Iraqis will not welcome U.S. military </p><p>actions and that military action will inspire a new </p><p>generation of anti-American violence -- are themes that we </p><p>have been hearing more in Jordan in recent weeks as the U.S. </p><p>public debate about the possibility of military action has </p><p>increased.  There are many variations on the theme, including </p><p>a remark by a Baghdad-based Western diplomat that the Iraqi </p><p>civilian majority -- hating and fearing the regime, but </p><p>mistrustful of promises by outsiders -- will simply "lock the </p><p>doors, close the shutters, and wait it all out." </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
