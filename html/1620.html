<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000579 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR SUTPHIN </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA AMB TWINING </p><p> </p><p></p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CE </p><p>SUBJECT: COLOMBO CALM AFTER THREE MONTHS OF LTTE CEASEFIRE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) COLOMBO 0234, (B) COLOMBO 0201, (C) COLOMBO 0188, </p><p>(D) COLOMBO 0182, (E) COLOMBO 0156, (F) COLOMBO 0108, (G) 00 </p><p>COLOMBO 2773, (H) 00 COLOMBO 2760 </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) SUMMARY:  RELATIVE CALM PREVAILS IN COLOMBO MORE </p><p>THAN THREE MONTHS AFTER AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN DECEMBER 2000 BY </p><p>THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE) OF A UNILATERAL </p><p>CEASE-FIRE (SEE REFTELS A-C, F-H).  AFTER A SERIES OF </p><p>OFFENSIVES TO RECLAIM PART OF THE JAFFNA PENINSULA, SRI </p><p>LANKAN ARMED FORCES HAVE REFRAINED FROM MAJOR MILITARY </p><p>OPERATIONS IN AREAS HELD BY THE LTTE, ALTHOUGH AERIAL </p><p>BOMBARDMENT OF SUSPECTED LTTE BASES CONTINUES.  DESPITE THE </p><p>CALM, THE SINHALESE PUBLIC BOTH IN COLOMBO AND RURAL AREAS </p><p>OF THE SOUTH REMAINS SKEPTICAL ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR PEACE. </p><p>ENGLISH-MEDIUM MEDIA HAVE WITHHELD JUDGEMENT ABOUT POSSIBLE </p><p>PEACE TALKS, ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE VERNACULAR SINHALESE PRESS </p><p>INSISTS FAILURE OF PEACE TALKS WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO </p><p>RESUMPTION OF HOSTILITIES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COLOMBO-BASED PRESS ANALYSTS WHO HAVE COVERED THE </p><p>CONFLICT FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES SAY THE RECENT CALM IN THE </p><p>CAPITAL REMINDS THEM OF 1987, WHEN THE LTTE AGREED TO LAY </p><p>DOWN ARMS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE INDO-LANKA ACCORD.  THEY </p><p>STRESS BREAKDOWNS IN THE PEACE PROCESS, IN 1987 AND </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY, HAVE IMMUNIZED THE PUBLIC FROM HOPING TOO MUCH </p><p>FOR PEACE AND SAY PEOPLE HAVE VERY LOW EXPECTATIONS THE </p><p>CURRENT LULL WILL CONTINUE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  LOCAL POLITICAL ORGANIZERS AND ACADEMICS IN THE </p><p>PREDOMINANTLY SINHALA-SPEAKING PROVINCES OF UVA, </p><p>SABARAGAMUWA AND THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE TOLD EMBOFF DURING A </p><p>TRIP IN EARLY APRIL THAT FEW PEOPLE IN THESE RURAL DISTRICTS </p><p>HAD GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT TO THE THREE MONTHS OF RELATIVE CALM </p><p>IN COLOMBO.  THEY SAID THE PUBLIC CONTINUES TO EXPRESS GREAT </p><p>SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE LTTE\'S MOTIVES IN ANNOUNCING ITS CEASE- </p><p>FIRE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  GOVERNMENT ENGLISH-LANGUAGE MEDIA HAS NEITHER EXTOLLED </p><p>NOR DECRIED THE RECENT CALM, BUT SOME SECTIONS OF THE </p><p>SINHALA-LANGUAGE PRESS CONTINUE TO WARN OF IMPENDING ATTACKS </p><p>BY THE LTTE.  OPPOSITION UNITED NATIONAL PARTY (UNP) SOURCES </p><p>ACCUSE THE GSL OF USING THE THREAT OF RENEWED LTTE ATTACKS </p><p>TO JUSTIFY CONTINUED HEAVY DEFENSE EXPENDITURE AND SAY THE </p><p>GSL CONTINUES TO USE THE ONGOING WAR ISSUE TO DISTRACT </p><p>ATTENTION FROM THE ECONOMY\'S WEAKNESS AND RISING COST OF </p><p>LIVING (SEE REFTELS D-E). </p><p> </p><p>5.  A MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SOURCE ATTACHED TO SRI LANKA\'S </p><p>LARGEST MILITARY TRAINING ACADEMY, AT DIYATALAWA, TOLD </p><p>EMBOFF THAT ALTHOUGH THE MILITARY HAD NOT LET ITS GUARD DOWN </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO THE LTTE\'S CEASE-FIRE ANNOUNCEMENT, MANY </p><p>MILITARY OFFICERS NONETHELESS EXPRESS CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE </p><p>NORWAY-LED PEACE PROCESS.  DESPITE ALL THE RHETORIC OF WAR, </p><p>HE SAID, "SOLDIERS YEARN FOR PEACE MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE." </p><p> </p><p>6.   COMMENT:  BUDDHIST AND HINDU NEW YEAR CELEBRATIONS </p><p>TYPICALLY MAKE MID-APRIL A QUIET TIME; THE LTTE\'S CEASE-FIRE </p><p>AND MANEUVERS AROUND THE POSSIBILITY OF PEACE TALKS HAVE </p><p>MADE THIS ONE OF THE QUIETEST APRILS IN YEARS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>DEEP MISTRUST OF LTTE INTENTIONS CONTINUES IN MUCH OF THE </p><p>SINHALESE PUBLIC, PEOPLE IN COLOMBO UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE ENJOYED </p><p>THE LAST THREE BOMB-FREE MONTHS.  MOST PEOPLE NOW BELIEVE </p><p>SOME SORT OF TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND LTTE WILL </p><p>OCCUR, BUT EXPECTATIONS ABOUT POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF TALKS </p><p>REMAIN LOW.  NOBODY WILL BE SURPRISED IF -- SOME WOULD SAY </p><p>"WHEN" -- THE EXPLOSIONS BEGIN AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
