BEGIN TEXT OF FAO-WFP LETTER TO US MISSION. "DEAR MR. </p><p>LAVELLE: </p><p> </p><p>AS YOU KNOW, THE FAO AND WFP FREQUENTLY ORGANIZE JOINT CFSA </p><p>(CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY ASSESSMENT) MISSIONS TO CARRY OUT </p><p>RAPID OVERALL ASSESSMENTS OF THE FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND </p><p>SITUATION IN COUNTRIES IN A STATE OF CRISIS.
