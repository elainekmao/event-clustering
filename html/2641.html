<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000882 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 18/03/02 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: OBASANJO NOT DOING WELL ACCORDING NASSARAWA STATE </p><p>GOVERNOR ADAMU: BUT MAY BE THE BEST WE CAN DO </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5(B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY: On February 16, Governor Alhaji Abdullah </p><p>Adamu warmly welcomed Ambassador Jeter him as the first </p><p>American Ambassador to ever visit Nassarawa State. Adamu </p><p>noted that the dangers to democracy were mounting and gave </p><p>low marks to Obasanjo as a politician and a communicator. </p><p>However, Adamu did not see an alternative to Obasanjo in </p><p>2003; for the sake of stability he thought Obasanjo should </p><p>return to office. Adamu believed that Ibrahim Babangida, </p><p>too clearly identified with military rule, would garner </p><p>little popular support. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  During a February 15 visit to Benue State, the </p><p>Ambassador, stopped in the capital city of Lafia to visit </p><p>Nassarawa Governor Abdullah Adamu. Adamu, head of the </p><p>Governor\'s Forum, is a well respected political figure who </p><p>prefers to do most of his work behind the scenes and </p><p>outside the public glare. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Adamu stated that Nigeria, politically, was "not </p><p>well." According to Adamu, two major problems plague </p><p>Nigeria as it moves toward the 2003 elections.  First, </p><p>there is a systematic, deliberate intention by some to </p><p>undermine democracy by constantly focusing on its failures </p><p>without offering solutions.  These attacks are effective </p><p>because "expectations for democracy were high and </p><p>Nigerians\' patience is low." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Second, poverty, and youth unemployment are being </p><p>exploited by certain well- heeled Nigerians, especially </p><p>retired military officers who were flushed out of political </p><p>positions upon the return to democracy. Adamu implied that </p><p>these provocateurs could exploit poverty by shelling out </p><p>Naira to forment unrest and violence along ethnic, </p><p>religious and regional lines.  The Governor suggested that </p><p>although these people may not be colluding consciously, </p><p>they have a common enemy in the government and their </p><p>efforts collectively have seriously injured the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Assessing Obasanjo\'s chances of re-election, Adamu </p><p>said that the President had lost popularity in the North </p><p>because he failed to give enough attention to the states in </p><p>that region. People were feeling a sense of betrayal. </p><p>However, "when the chips are down" some of the Northern </p><p>leaders will "forgive and support him."  Adamu contended </p><p>that Obasanjo still has a problem with his fellow Yorubas, </p><p>who have never forgiven him for not manipulating the 1979 </p><p>election in favor of Awolowo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  The Governor scored Obasanjo low on political </p><p>strategy, public relations and information management.  He </p><p>cited the Electoral Act as an example of Obasanjo\'s </p><p>failing. He suggested that the bill could have been worked </p><p>in a way that would not have pitted the central government </p><p>against the governors and much of the rest of the country. </p><p>Instead, the Administration had allowed the tenure of local </p><p>governments to become a major political issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Despite Obasanjo\'s problems, Adamu did not see an </p><p>alternative that could stabilize the country.  While the </p><p>name of former Head of State Ibrahim Babangida is on the </p><p>lips of many as an emerging contender, Adamu discounted the </p><p>idea of a Babangida presidency.  Because he is so closely </p><p>associated with military rule and all of the abuses that </p><p>emerged from it, Adamu thought an IBB candidacy would open </p><p>old wounds and could destabilize the country, "That\'s not </p><p>the way to sincerely fight corruption," he stressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Governor Adamu thought the United States should </p><p>encourage Obasanjo and the country to support democratic </p><p>continuity and sustain Nigeria\'s democratic institutions. </p><p>"If we don\'t handle the transition well, it will create </p><p>problems we can\'t estimate," he concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Comment: Adamu does not seek the spotlight as much </p><p>as some his gubernatorial colleagues but he is considered </p><p>an astute politician whose views are respected by his </p><p>peers.  Adamu is part of a growing chorus lamenting the </p><p>state of national politics and criticizing the President\'s </p><p>performance; however, his view that currently there is no </p><p>alternative figure who can better stabilize the country is </p><p>telling. His low estimation of a potential Babangida </p><p>candidacy is a reminder that many along the political elite </p><p>as well as ordinary citizens, see a Babangida candidacy as </p><p>a potential step backwards. End Comment </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
