HALL DREW THE BOARD\'S ATTENTION TO </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S FEBRUARY 1 RADIO ADDRESS TO THE NATION </p><p>WHERE THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED THAT MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY FOOD AID COMES AS A GIFT FROM THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES. HE CITED THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>ANNOUNCED INTENTION IN 2004 TO REQUEST MORE THAN ONE BILLION </p><p>DOLLARS TO MEET EMERGENCY FOOD NEEDS WORLDWIDE, AND A </p><p>PROPOSED U.S. DOLLAR 200 MILLION "FAMINE FUND" TO BRING </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO AFRICA AND OTHER REGIONS FACING STARVATION. </p><p> </p><p>7. AMBASSADOR HALL ALSO NOTED THAT THERE EXISTS IN BOTH </p><p>GENEVA AND NEW YORK AN OECD-CONSTITUTED HUMANITARIAN LIAISON </p><p>WORKING GROUP (HLWG) TO DISCUSS MATTERS OF COMMON CONCERN </p><p>AMONGST DONORS AND OCCASIONALLY WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF </p><p>RELEVANT PARTS OF THE VARIOUS UN SECRETARIATS.

WFP HAS </p><p>RATCHETED UP ITS BUDGETARY NEEDS ESTIMATES BY U.S. DOLLARS </p><p>600 MILLION OVER THE 2002 LEVEL (WITHOUT FACTORING IN IRAQ). </p><p>CLEARLY, THE NUMBERS ARE OVERWHELMING THE SYSTEM AND </p><p>STRETCHING WFP\'S COPING CAPACITY TO SOMEWHERE NEAR THE </p><p>BREAKING POINT.
