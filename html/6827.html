Please Protect Accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: World Airways\' troubles securing landing rights from </p><p>the Ministry of Aviation for charter service between Lagos, New York, </p><p>and Atlanta could soon be over. On March 21, Minister of Aviation Kema </p><p>Chikwe signed a memo approving World Airways\' application and forwarded </p><p>it to President Obasanjo, who will likely send it to Nigeria\'s Federal </p><p>Executive Council (FEC) during the next few weeks for final approval. </p><p>The Ministry\'s assent followed a March 19 meeting between Chikwe, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, and World Airways Station Manager Pat Munson to </p><p>determine the status of World Airways\' application.  After chiding the </p><p>airline for not approaching her directly about the charter </p><p>service, the Minister said she would expedite the process.  Chikwe\'s </p><p>decision to approve the application came after nearly two months of USG </p><p>insistence that the Ministry of Aviation respect Nigeria\'s bilateral </p><p>commitment with the United States and grant World Airways\' landing righ </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On March 21, Chikwe informed the Ambassador that she had </p><p>signed a memo approving World Airways\' application to operate air </p><p>service between the United States and Nigeria and had forwarded it to </p><p>the President for likely FEC consideration and final approval </p><p>during the next few weeks.  This followed a March 19 meeting between </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Minister Chikwe, and World Airways\' Station </p><p>ManagerPat Munson.  After several unsuccessful attempts World Airways </p><p>finally had a chance during the meeting to formally introduce itself to </p><p>Chikwe and to assuage the Minister\'s concerns.  Chikwe said the airline </p><p>had only itself to blame for the delay in approval, as World Airways </p><p>should have approached her before beginning advertising service.  Munso </p><p>apologized and sought guidance on the correct procedure to follow.  The </p><p>Minister accepted Munson\'s apology and said she would do all she could </p><p>to expedite World Airways\' application. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Background </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In January 2003, World Airways, a licensed U.S. carrier, </p><p>filed a request with the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) and </p><p>the Ministry of Transportation to operate a charter flight between the </p><p>United States and Nigeria.  The USG had granted World Airways worldwide </p><p>charter authority; in addition, the USG had authorized the touroperator </p><p>RiteTime Aviation and Travel Services, to market the service. </p><p>By letter dated February 4, the GON\'s Ministry of Aviation acknowledged </p><p>that it was considering World Airways\' application.  The Ministry of </p><p>Aviation nonetheless asked USDOT to confirm that World Airways was a </p><p>"dependable" airline and not a front for Nigerians in the United States </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) According to DOT officials, bilateral partners, such as </p><p>Nigeria, customarily accept USG designation as sufficient evidence to </p><p>approve service under the Open Skies Agreement.  The DOT, nonetheless, </p><p>provided a letter to the Ministry in late February stating that World </p><p>Airways is "fit, willing and able" to provide air transport.  Despite </p><p>repeated attempts by Post to arrange a meeting between Minister Chikwe </p><p>and World Airways in late February and early March, the Minister was </p><p>unavailable (often campaigning with the President), and the </p><p>Ministry of Aviation was also unable to provide information to the </p><p>Embassy or World Airways concerning the application process.  The </p><p>Ambassador then met with President Obasanjo on March 7 to discuss </p><p>World Airways\' approval request.  During the meeting, Obasanjo said the </p><p>solution to the problem was for World Airways to find another tour oper </p><p>(Comment. Based on our conversations with World Airways officials over </p><p>last two months, without RiteTime, World Airways will not fly to Nigeri </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>More Background: DOT and Post Efforts </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) During a March 11 meeting with Ambassador Jeter and visiting </p><p>Deputy Assistant Secretary of Transportation Joel Szabat, DAS Szabat </p><p>and Jeter expressed concern over the Ministry\'s delay in approving </p><p>World Airways service, which under the current Open Skies </p><p>agreement should be granted with "minimum procedural delay."  Szabat </p><p>stressed that the USG had fulfilled its obligation by designating World </p><p>Airways an approved carrier.  (The Notice of Designation was transmitte </p><p>via Diplomatic Note in August 2001, then again as a courtesy in </p><p>February 2003.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) DAS Szabat reminded the Minister about the importance of </p><p>faithfully honoring the bilateral air agreement and encouraged Chikwe </p><p>to set a good precedent for other U.S. carriers potentially interested </p><p>in beginning direct service to Nigeria.  Should World Airways face too </p><p>many difficulties in securing landing rights, he said, other U.S. </p><p>carriers would not look favorably on doing business in Nigeria. </p><p>Kevin Sample, Senior Advisor DOT, reminded the Minister that USG </p><p>approval of the now suspended Nigeria Airways wet lease agreement with </p><p>Atlanta Icelandic had taken less than 24 hours. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) During the March 11 meeting, the Minister complained about </p><p>World Airways\' alleged procedural failings.  She criticized World Airwa </p><p>for not notifying the Ministry before the airline began </p><p>advertising the new service.  According to the Minister, the airline </p><p>should have approached her in person with the appropriate paperwork </p><p>before going public and advertising the service.  Minister Chikwe also </p><p>questioned World Airways\' choice of business partner, Peter Obafemi, </p><p>whose company is responsible for advertising and selling tickets. </p><p>Obafemi had been involved in a failed deal with the National Aircraft </p><p>Maintenance Project, which publicly embarrassed the Minister.  Szabat </p><p>reminded the Minister that the question about the ticketing agent was </p><p>in no way related to the issue of Nigeria\'s respect of its bilateral </p><p>commitment to the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Minister next tried to link its approval of World Airways </p><p>with Nigeria\'s attainment of Category I status.  This FAA top safety </p><p>ranking, which reflects international standards, would allow Nigeria to </p><p>fly its planes and crews to the United States.  Chikwe said she would </p><p>find it much easier to approve World Airways after Nigeria obtained </p><p>Category I status.  Both Szabat and the Ambassador made clear that the </p><p>two issues cannot be linked, as approval of air carriers falls under </p><p>our bilateral agreement whereas the Category I standing depends on </p><p>Nigeria\'s ability to pass an international aviation safety assessment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) By the end of the March 11 meeting, Chikwe, although upset, </p><p>said she still supported the deal and would put the issue before the </p><p>Federal Executive Council after she received a recommendation from the </p><p>NCAA and the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Now that the Minister has met World Airways staff and vented </p><p>her frustration, approval of the airline\'s request should become a </p><p>reality.  However, considering her past attempts to delay the deal, she </p><p>may not be willing to admit defeat so easily. Her personal grudge </p><p>against World Airways\' ticketing agent, Peter Obafemi, remains a proble </p><p>although she assured the Ambassador that the two had </p><p>reconciled.  Chikwe\'s animosity towards Obafemi is compounded by her </p><p>unfamiliarity with World Airways, which led her to suspect the </p><p>deal waspossibly another swindle. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
