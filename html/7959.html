<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001333 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, MNUC, IR, CA, NPT, Iran </p><p>SUBJECT: NPT: IRAN\'S BOGUS CLAIMS OF CANADIAN NUCLEAR </p><p>COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>(C) Canada\'s Department of Foreign Affairs and International </p><p>Trade (DFAIT) informed us that in its May 5 briefing at the </p><p>NPT PrepCom, Iran indicated that it is considering use of </p><p>Canadian Cando reactors in the Iranian nuclear program. </p><p>DFAIT reminded us that there is no public or private Canadian </p><p>nuclear cooperation with Iran, and that the GoC will continue </p><p>to ensure no future cooperation.  Iran\'s motivation in citing </p><p>Cando, DFAIT continued, was to try to butress their claims </p><p>that the Iranian nuclear program is purely civilian.  DFAIT </p><p>noted that "Nucleonics Week" has already picked up this story </p><p>from Iran\'s presentation.  The GoC is trying to beat the </p><p>story back with Nucleonics Week, but it will likely get some </p><p>press play. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
