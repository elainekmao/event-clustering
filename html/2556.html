<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000467 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PREL, NP, IN, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI REACTION TO TRADE TREATY RENEWAL WITH INDIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 KATHMANDU 1675 </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Reaction in Kathmandu to the March 2 signing of </p><p>the revised bilateral trade treaty between Nepal and India in </p><p>New Delhi has been mixed.  The revised treaty terms include </p><p>value addition requirements on manufactured goods and imposed </p><p>quota restrictions on four items that together account for </p><p>about 25 percent of Nepal\'s exports to India.  Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) officials, who had feared India would impose even </p><p>more restrictive terms, are publicly billing the renewal a </p><p>success.  Reaction in the business community is varied, but </p><p>most believe the deal their Commerce Secretary signed is </p><p>likely the best that Nepal, with limited bargaining power and </p><p>next-to-no leverage, could hope for.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>HIGHER VALUE ADDITION REQUIREMENTS; </p><p>QUOTAS ON "SURGE" ITEMS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Reaction in Kathmandu to the March 2 signing in </p><p>New Delhi of the revised bilateral trade treaty between Nepal </p><p>and India has been mixed.  Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>officials are gamely--but not vociferously--claiming success. </p><p> Sources in the business community are generally less </p><p>sanguine, but largely believe that the deal their Commerce </p><p>Secretary signed is likely the best Nepal could hope for. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Under the 1996 treaty, which came up for renewal in </p><p>December, the value of Nepali exports to its largest trading </p><p>partner increased by nearly seven times over the past five </p><p>years.  India now accounts for 43 percent of Nepal\'s total </p><p>export market.  Re-negotiation of the treaty terms, which </p><p>offered duty-free, quota-free access to specified exports, </p><p>has been hanging like a black cloud over Nepal\'s Trade </p><p>Ministry and the local business community since August 14, </p><p>when the Government of India first announced its intention to </p><p>open the treaty for review (Reftel).  India\'s concerns, </p><p>according to Bhanu Prasad Acharya, Nepal\'s Trade Secretary, </p><p>focused on two points:  1) the amount of value addition </p><p>required for Nepali exports to qualify for duty-free, </p><p>quota-free access; and 2) a purported "surge" in the volume </p><p>of some exports. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The revised terms impose a quota on Nepal\'s exports </p><p>of four items (vegetable ghee, zinc oxide, copper wire, and </p><p>acrylic yarn), which accounted for about 25 percent of </p><p>Nepal\'s  exports to India over the past year.  In addition, </p><p>Nepal\'s manufactured exports must meet a minimum standard of </p><p>25 percent value addition during the first year of the </p><p>five-year treaty and 30 percent thereafter in order to </p><p>qualify for duty-free access.  The agreement also reportedly </p><p>allows for the unilateral imposition of anti-dumping measures </p><p>if either party\'s complaints of dumping are not address </p><p>within 60 days of formal notice.  The new terms take effect </p><p>March 6. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>GON CLAIMS MODEST SUCCESS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) According to Purushottam Ojha, Joint Secretary at </p><p>Nepal\'s Ministry of Trade, only the GON\'s "hard bargaining" </p><p>prevented India from pressing for even less generous terms. </p><p>For example, Ojha said the Indians had originally pushed for </p><p>70 percent value addition.  Besides haggling the value </p><p>addition requirement down by more than half, Ojha said his </p><p>Ministry also succeeded in persuading India to exempt a fifth </p><p>export--steel pipes--from quota restrictions.  He added the </p><p>Indians were "adamant" about imposing some restrictions on </p><p>the four items. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY SEES RED </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) While the Trade Ministry may be trying to paint the </p><p>new agreement as a modest triumph, reaction in the business </p><p>community is more varied.  Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, the </p><p>President of the Nepal Chamber of Commerce, told us the </p><p>revised terms killed the "spirit" of the 1996 treaty by </p><p>giving India greater latitude in restricting exports.  New </p><p>provisions allowing the imposition of anti-dumping measures </p><p>will leave Nepali industries at the mercy of India, he </p><p>predicted.  Arun Chaudhury, head of the Nepal-India Chamber </p><p>of Commerce, on the other hand, said that Nepal must expand </p><p>its industrial base and should not count on special favors </p><p>from its trading partners to stay afloat.  The world has </p><p>changed since 1996, and Nepal must change with it, he said. </p><p>Banwari Lal Mittal of the Nepal-USA Chamber of Commerce </p><p>speculated that exporters of the four items now subject to </p><p>quota restrictions might actually benefit from having fewer </p><p>competitors in the market. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Most Nepalis--including those at the Trade </p><p>Ministry--realize the GON had few bargaining chips and </p><p>next-to-no leverage going into the negotiations.  The terms </p><p>of the 1996 treaty were generous to Nepal, and a raft of </p><p>businesses tailored to export products to India under those </p><p>very conditions--including the lack of value added </p><p>requirements--have sprung up in the intervening five years to </p><p>take advantage of that generosity.  But 2001 was not a good </p><p>year for Nepali businesses for a number of reasons.  The </p><p>combined effects of September 11 and the Maoists insurgency </p><p>have crippled tourism; the international airport recorded 42 </p><p>percent fewer arrivals in November (the peak season) this </p><p>year than last.  Meanwhile, exports of garments to the U.S., </p><p>Nepal\'s largest textile market, have declined by 20 percent. </p><p>India may have taken these factors into account in granting, </p><p>according to the Trade Ministry, less rigorous terms than </p><p>originally contemplated.  The observation that Nepal must </p><p>expand its industrial base is just, but for Nepali </p><p>businessmen struggling to get by, the message could not have </p><p>come at a more difficult time. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
