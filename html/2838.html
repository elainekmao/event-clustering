SUMMARY:   A COALITION OF COUNTRIES (DEVELOPED AND </p><p>DEVELOPING)IS PROMOTING WORLD FOOD SUMMIT FIVE YEARS </p><p>LATER ENDORSEMENT OF A VOLUNTARY CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE </p><p>RIGHT TO FOOD AS A "DELIVERABLE" OF THE UPCOMING SUMMIT- </p><p>LEVEL MEETING.  THE UNITED STATES OBJECTED TO A CODE OF </p><p>CONDUCT AT THE 1996 WORLD FOOD SUMMIT AND CONTINUES TO </p><p>OPPOSE ONE ON THE GROUNDS THAT A CODE WILL DO LITTLE TO </p><p>PROMOTE FREEDOM FROM HUNGER, AND IS LIKELY TO STIPULATE </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDUCT (NO SANCTIONS/EMBARGOES, </p><p>NO GMO\'S, ANTI-FREE TRADE) WHICH IS AGAINST U.S. PRIVATE </p><p>AND PUBLIC INTERESTS.  HOWEVER, IF THE CODE\'S ENDORSEMENT </p><p>CANNOT BE PREVENTED, A LATIN AMERICAN PROPOSAL -- TO HAVE </p><p>AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING GROUP UNDER FAO AUSPICES </p><p>DRAFT THE CODE -- MAY BE PREFERABLE TO A NORWEGIAN </p><p>PROPOSAL TO HAVE THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>DRAFT THE CODE OF CONDUCT.  WASHINGTON VIEWS REQUESTED. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p>2.  A CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD IS "UNFINISHED </p><p>BUSINESS" FROM THE 1996 WORLD FOOD SUMMIT.  THE U.S. </p><p>SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING OUT A SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO A CODE </p><p>AT THE SUMMIT, BUT A LIVELY DEBATE ON THE CODE CONTINUED. </p><p>A CIVIL-SOCIETY DRAFTED CODE OF CONDUCT HAS BEEN </p><p>CIRCULATED, AND IS FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO IN RIGHT TO </p><p>FOOD LITERATURE (AND MIGHT BE DRAWN ON FOR ANY FUTURE </p><p>NEGOTIATED TEXT).  COMMENT 12 ON RIGHT TO FOOD BY THE UN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02071  01 OF 02  291555Z </p><p>COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS (2000) </p><p>STATED THAT "THE PRIVATE SECTOR - NATIONAL AND </p><p>TRANSNATIONAL - SHOULD PURSUE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK OF A CODE OF CONDUCT TO RESPECT THE RIGHT TO </p><p>ADEQUATE FOOD, AGREED UPON JOINTLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND CIVIL SOCIETY." </p><p> </p><p>WHY IS THE U.S. AGAINST THE RIGHT TO FOOD AND A CODE OF </p><p>CONDUCT? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>3.  DRAFTING A CODE OF CONDUCT - IN ADDITION TO BEING A </p><p>VERY POOR USE OF FAO\'S SCARCE RESOURCES -- WILL NOT HELP </p><p>COUNTRIES IMPROVE FOOD SECURITY ON THE GROUND: IF THE </p><p>EXISTING CIVIL SOCIETY CODE IS ANY GUIDE, IT WILL BECOME </p><p>A POLITICAL DIATRIBE AGAINST TRADE LIBERALIZATION, </p><p>AGAINST MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS, AGAINST </p><p>SANCTIONS/EMBARGOES AND AGAINST GMO\'S.  OF EVEN MORE </p><p>CONCERN, IT SEEKS TO SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY FOR HUNGER FROM </p><p>NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, AND ONTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND </p><p>"THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY." </p><p> </p><p>4.  FURTHERMORE, IT IMPLIES ACCEPTANCE OF A LEGALLY </p><p>BINDING RIGHT TO FOOD WHICH IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE U.S. </p><p>POSITION AS STATED AT THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT.  THE U.S. </p><p>POSITION ON RIGHT TO FOOD IS THAT IT IS A GOAL OR </p><p>ASPIRATION TO BE REALIZED PROGRESSIVELY WHICH DOES NOT </p><p>GIVE RISE TO ANY INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS TO REDRESS </p><p>VIOLATIONS OR COMPENSATE VICTIMS, NOR DOES IT DIMINISH </p><p>THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TOWARD THEIR </p><p>CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02071  01 OF 02  291555Z </p><p>CURRENT STATE OF PLAY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>5.  ALTHOUGH THE FAO HAS BEEN ABLE TO GENERATE LITTLE </p><p>ENTHUSIASM FOR ITS PROPOSALS TO SPEED UP WORK ON THE </p><p>STILL-UNFINISHED DECLARATION FOR THE JUNE 10-13 WORLD </p><p>FOOD SUMMIT FIVE YEARS LATER (WFS5YL), INTENSE ACTIVITY </p><p>IS TAKING PLACE IN AND OUTSIDE OF ITALY ON THE "RIGHT TO </p><p>FOOD" SEGMENT OF THE DRAFT DECLARATION.  THE GOVERNMENTS </p><p>OF ITALY AND NORWAY HAVE SPONSORED (AND GERMANY WILL </p><p>SPONSOR MAY 22-23) SEMINARS ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD WITH A </p><p>VIEW TO GATHERING SUPPORT FOR A CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE </p><p>RIGHT TO FOOD AS A "DELIVERABLE" FOR THE UPCOMING WFS5YL. </p><p>(THE UNITED STATES WAS INVITED TO THE ITALIAN AND GERMAN </p><p>SEMINARS, BUT WAS NOT INVITED TO THE NORWEGIAN EVENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  POLITICAL "BUY-IN" HAS BEEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN </p><p>ITALY, WHERE THE ITALIAN MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE STATED </p><p>HIS SUPPORT FOR A CODE AT A SEMINAR ORGANIZED BY THE </p><p>ITALIAN MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND THE JACQUES MARITAIN </p><p>INSTITUTE (REFTEL).

SIMILARLY, THE GERMAN SEMINAR IS TO BE </p><p>OPENED BY THE GERMAN MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND CONSUMER </p><p>PROTECTION, RENATE KUNAST. </p><p> </p><p>NORWEGIAN PROPOSAL </p><p>------------------ </p><p>7.  A NORWEGIAN NON-PAPER CIRCULATED AMONG EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRY MISSIONS IN ROME PROPOSES RE-OPENING THE ROME </p><p>DECLARATION AND PROGRAM OF ACTION TO INVITE THE HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER ON HUMAN RIGHTS TO DEVELOP A VOLUNTARY CODE </p><p>OF CONDUCT ON THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE FOOD, "WITH A VIEW TO </p><p>POLICY AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT, MEANS AND METHODS OF </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION, NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND MONITORING, AS </p><p>WELL AS MAKING NATIONAL REPORTING BY STATES PARTIES TO </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL TREATY BODY (THE COVENANT ON ECONOMIC, </p><p>SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS) MAXIMALLY RELEVANT." </p><p> </p><p>LATIN AMERICAN PROPOSAL </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>8.  A LATIN AMERICAN GROUP (GRULAC) PROPOSAL TAKES </p><p>ANOTHER TACK (VENEZUELA IS THE LEADING COUNTRY AMONG THE </p><p>LATINS ON THIS ISSUE):  FODAG RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING FROM </p><p>GRULAC 4/26/02: </p><p> </p><p>BEING TEXT: </p><p>WE UNDERLINE OUR CONVICTION THAT A VOLUNTARY CODE OF </p><p>CONDUCT ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD WILL HELP STRENGTHEN THE </p><p>POLICIES DIRECTED AT ACHIEVING FOOD SECURITY FOR ALL, AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02071  02 OF 02  291555Z </p><p>THEREFORE DECIDE TO ESTABLISH AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL </p><p>WORKING GROUP FOR THE ELABORATION OF THE VOLUNTARY CODE </p><p>OF CONDUCT WITH A TWO-YEAR PERIOD, IN COORDINATION WITH </p><p>THE RELEVANT UN ORGANISMS THROUGH THE FAO SECRETARIAT. </p><p>THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING GROUP SHALL INFORM THE </p><p>COMMITTEE ON FOOD SECURITY OF ITS RESULTS. </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>PROPOSED ACTION </p><p>--------------- </p><p>9. ASSUMING THERE IS OVERWHELMING PRESSURE FOR THE WFS5YL </p><p>TO APPROVE A CODE OF CONDUCT, FODAG SEES THE FOLLOWING </p><p>ADVANTAGES OF THE GRULAC PROPOSAL: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE DRAFTING IS IN THE HANDS OF AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL </p><p>BODY(RATHER THAN THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS) </p><p>WHERE THE U.S. CAN PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY; </p><p> </p><p>--  FAO HAS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH CODES OF CONDUCT </p><p>(PESTICIDES, FISHERIES).

THE U.S. WOULD NEED TO WORK FOR THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>-- CONSENSUS DECISION MAKING; </p><p> </p><p>-- INDUSTRY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION; </p><p> </p><p>-- THE BODY STARTS FROM SCRATCH (NOT USING THE CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY DRAFTED CODE AS A BASIS.)
