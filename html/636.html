CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: CONSUL GENERAL MET WITH SDP LEADER AND </p><p>RECENT DETAINEE SHEHU YAR\'ADUA ON FEBRUARY 22. </p><p>YAR\'ADUA SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHY HE HAD BEEN DETAINED, </p><p>BUT THOUGHT IT WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HAD REFUSED TO </p><p>JOIN THE ABACHA GOVERNMENT, HAD SPOKEN OPENLY AGAINST </p><p>IT, AND ALSO HAD AN ORGANIZATION AND FOLLOWING BEHIND </p><p>HIM.  YAR\'ADUA BELIEVES THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE WILL BE </p><p>HELD, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY TAKE DIRECTIONS THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WILL NOT WISH OR BE ABLE TO CONTROL.  HE FIRMLY </p><p>BELIEVES ALL DELEGATES TO IT SHOULD BE ELECTED AND THAT </p><p>THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT MUST NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO VETO </p><p>OR CHANGE THE CONFERENCE\'S DECISIONS, ESPECIALLY ON THE </p><p>LENGTH OF TIME THE PRC SHOULD STAY IN POWER.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SHEHU YAR\'ADUA HAS BEEN HOSTING A NON-STOP </p><p>POLITICAL HOUSE PARTY SINCE HIS RELEASE FROM DETENTION </p><p>IN THE EARLY HOURS OF FEBRUARY 16.  THE STREAM OF </p><p>VISITORS TO HIS HOME HAS BEEN STEADY, REPORTED DAILY IN </p><p>SUCH KADUNA PAPERS AS THE DEMOCRAT.  HE HAS, HOWEVER, </p><p>CONSISTENTLY REFUSED TO GRANT INTERVIEWS TO THE PRESS, </p><p>IN SPITE OF OHE FACT THAT THEY HAVE STAKED HIM OUT FOR </p><p>THE PAST WEEK.  WHEN CG CALLED ON YAR\'ADUA AT HIS HABIB </p><p>BANK OFFICE, SHE RAN INTO THE VOA STRINGER AMONG A </p><p>LARGE GROUP OF OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  YAR\'ADUA SAID HE COULD NOT REALLY EXPLAIN WHY HE </p><p>HAD BEEN DETAINED.  UNLIKE HIS DETENTION, ALONG WITH </p><p>TWELVE OTHERS, IN DECEMBER 1991, WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>MOTIVES OF THE BABANGIDA REGIME, HE COULD NOT FIND THE </p><p>LOGIC BEHIND THIS RECENT EPISODE.  WHEN ASKED IF HE HAD </p><p>BEEN INTERROGATED, HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD BEEN ASKED TO </p><p>ANSWER WRITTEN QUESTIONS THAT HE BELIEVED HAD BEEN SENT </p><p>UP FROM ABUJA.  "THEY WERE SO STUPID," HE SAID, THAT HE </p><p>HAD ENJOYED WRITING OBFUSCUTORY ANSWERS OR ONE-WORD </p><p>NEGATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  HE SAID THE COMMENTS OF OTHERS TO THE PRESS THAT </p><p>YAR\'ADUA HAD SAID NOTHING SO STRONG AS OBASANJO, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, WERE NOT VERY HELPFUL.  HE BELIEVED THE BIG </p><p>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND CRITICS LIKE OBASANJO WAS </p><p>THE FACT THAT HE, YAR\'ADUA, STILL HAD HIS ORGANIZATION </p><p>AMD FOLLOWING BEHIND HIM.  OBASANJO SPOKE ONLY FOR </p><p>HIMSELF, WHILE YAR\'ADUA HAD SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  YAR\'ADUA ALSO BELIEVED THE ABACHA REGIME MOVED </p><p>AGAINST HIM AS THE ONLY MAJOR POLITICAL FORCE THAT </p><p>REFUSED TO COLLABORATE IN THE CURRENT CABINET.  HE SAID </p><p>HE THOUGHT THAT MOST OF THOSE WHO JOINED THE CABINET </p><p>DID SO BECAUSE NIGERIANS DO NOT BELIEVE THEY CAN REFUSE </p><p>THE MILITARY.  AS A FORMER MILITARY OFFICER, HE KNEW </p><p>THERE WAS NO REASON TO GO RUNNING TO JOIN GOVERNMENT </p><p>WHEN ABACHA TOOK OVER.  AS A STAUNCH ADVOCATE OF </p><p>CIVILIAN DEMOCRATIC RULE, YAR\'ADUA BELIEVED THE ONLY </p><p>PRINCIPLED STAND WAS TO REFUSE TO TAKE PART IN AN </p><p>ILLEGAL REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>7.  YAR\'ADUA BELIEVED THE ABACHA REGIME WAS A </p><p>DO-NOTHING GROUP.  THERE WAS NO PLAN AND NO </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS.  THE ECONOMIC MEASURES HAD </p><p>NOT YET BEEN PUT IN PLACE.  YAR\'ADUA POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>NONE OF THE BANKS, HIS INCLUDED, HAD RECEIVED ANY WORD, </p><p>FOUR DAYS AFTER THE FIRST FOREIGN EXCHANGE AUCTION </p><p>SINCE DECEMBER, WHAT ALLOCATIONS HAD BEEN MADE AND TO </p><p>WHOM.  HE ALSO BELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO IDEA WHAT </p><p>WOULD COME FROM THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE AND THAT IT </p><p>WOULD BE UNABLE TO CONTROL THE FORCES ITS CONVENING </p><p>WOULD UNLEASH. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ON THE SUBJECT OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE, YAR\'ADUA </p><p>SAID THE REASON HE HAD CALLED IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>FOR A LIFTING OF THE PROHIBITION ON POLITICAL </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS AND MEETINGS WAS TO PERMIT THE FULLEST </p><p>POSSIBLE AIRING OF VIEWS PRIOR TO THE CONVENING OF THE </p><p>THIS PROCESS WAS BUILDING UP HEADS OF STEAM WITH NO </p><p>VENT.  SHOULD THIS CONTINUE, THE OPENING WEEKS OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WILL BE EXPLOSIVE.  HE FEARS THE MILITARY </p><p>GOVERNMENT MAY NOT PERMIT THE PROCESS TO CONTINUE UNTIL </p><p>MATTERS QUIET DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ASKED IF HE PLANNED TO BE A PART OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONFERENCE, YAR\'ADUA GAVE A MORE QUALIFIED RESPONSE </p><p>THAN THAT OF SIX WEEKS AGO (REFTEL D).  HE SAID HE </p><p>WOULD WAIT TO SEE THE TERMS OF REFERENCE, PARTICULARLY </p><p>ON THE QUESTION OF HOW THE DELEGATES WOULD BE CHOSEN. </p><p>HE WAS ADAMANT THAT THE CONFERENCE DELEGATES MUST ALL </p><p>BE ELECTED; IF INTEREST GROUPS OR TRADITIONAL RULERS </p><p>WISHED TO HAVE INPUTS, THEY SHOULD DEAL THROUGH THE </p><p>ELECTED DELEGATES, HE SAID.  THIS WAS A FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY.  FURTHER, HE THOUGHT IT WAS </p><p>POINTLESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY THAT THE QUESTION </p><p>OF NIGERIAN UNITY AMD WHAT BINDS THE COUNTRY TOGETHER </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE ON THE TABLE.  IT ALREADY WAS ON THE </p><p>TABLE, HE SAID, AND IT NEEDS DISCUSSION.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVEI E COURAGE TO LET THE ANGER BE </p><p>EXPRESSED AND PERMIT MORE FRUITFUL DISCUSSION TO </p><p>FOLLOW.  FINALLY, HE WAS WAITING TO SEE WHETHER THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WOULD BE GIVEN FULL AUTHORiTY, INCLUDING THE </p><p>AUTHORITY TO SET THE TIME LIMITS ON THE ABACHA </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  IN HIS VIEW, THIS WAS ALSO AN IRREDUCIBLE </p><p>REQUIREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  YAR\'ADUA REPLIED TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT BABANGIDA COULD STILL HOPE FOR </p><p>RESURRECTION AS A CIVILIAN ELECTED PRESIDENT BY SAYING </p><p>THAT "THE LONGER ABACHA REMAINS IN POWER, THE BETTER </p><p>BABANGIDA WILL LOOK."  NEVERTHELESS, YAR\'ADUA CLEARLY </p><p>ENDORSED THE BITTER ATTACK ON BABANGIDA MADE AT THE </p><p>AREWA HOUSE CONFERENCE BY HIS FORMER BOSS OBASANJO.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT BABANGIDA IS "TOO OLD, AND LAUGHED WHEN CG </p><p>SAID SHE AND IBB WERE THE SAME AGE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT: YAR\'ADUA AS ALWAYS WAS HARD TO READ.  HE </p><p>HAS A NERVOUS MANNER, WITH A FREQUENT COUGH AND MUCH </p><p>FIDGETING.  IN SPITE OF THESE PERSONAL MANNERISMS, HE </p><p>IS CHARISMATIC IN ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS, EXPRESSING </p><p>STRONG OPINIONS WITH CONVICTION.  THE PRINCIPLED </p><p>DEFENSE OF DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES HE DELIVERED RANG TRUE, </p><p>EXCEPT FOR THE NAGGING THOUGHT AT THE BACK OF THE MIND </p><p>THAT HE IS SITTING FAIRLY PRETTY TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE IF THE CONDITIONS HE OUTLINED </p><p>WIN OUT.  SINCE HE HAS NOT JOINED THE GOVERNMENT NOR </p><p>RECOMMENDED ANY PROXIES (AS HAVE, FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE </p><p>LIKE SARAKI AND SHINKAFI), HE IS "CLEAN."  ON BALANCE, </p><p>HOWEVER, WE WOULD JUDGE THAT YAR\'ADUA HAS CONSISTENTLY, </p><p>OVER THE TWO AND MORE YEARS WE HAVE HAD CONTACT, </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC CIVILIAN RULE IN </p><p>LANGUAGE THAT EXPRESSES BOTH CONVICTION AND A MORE </p><p>NUANCED UNDERSTANDING THAN WE HAVE MET IN OTHER </p><p>NIGERIAN POLITICIANS.  IN SHORT, THE ABACHA REGIME MAY </p><p>REGRET HAVING TAKEN A STEP THAT CAN ONLY HAVE ENHANCED </p><p>YAR\'ADUA\'S REPUTATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WEINLAND </p><p></p></div>
