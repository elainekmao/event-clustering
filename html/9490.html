The deadlock over peace talks between the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) and the Maoists remains unresolved.  The GON has </p><p>increased security in many districts throughout Nepal </p><p>following reports of increased Maoist activities.  The local </p><p>press reported on July 14 that Maoists are importing weapons </p><p>from points along the Nepal-India border.  The GON, yielding </p><p>to Maoist demands once again, released the three remaining </p><p>Maoist Central Committee Members from prison on July 12.  On </p><p>July 17 a team of security forces reportedly arrested </p><p>fourteen Maoists who were armed and carrying explosives. </p><p>Bharat Dhungana, head of the Maoists\' office in Kathmandu, </p><p>alleged that he was handcuffed and held for five hours by </p><p>security forces on July 17.  Maoist disregard for the code </p><p>of conduct continued, with the brazen abduction of two </p><p>unarmed Royal Nepal Army (RNA) soldiers on July 9.  The </p><p>insurgents reportedly also killed a district committee </p><p>member of the Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (CPN-UML), and abducted five other civilians, </p><p>including two youths and a police constable.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>THIRD ROUND OF TALKS REMAINS ELUSIVE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  The future of peace negotiations remains uncertain as </p><p>Maoist leaders still have not responded to the formal letter </p><p>from the GON inviting them to a third round of talks. </p><p>Initial reports suggested that the Maoists would issue a </p><p>response on July 17, but to date there has been no reply. </p><p>Kamal Thapa, Minister for Communication and Information and </p><p>government negotiating team member, reportedly sent a formal </p><p>letter to Baburam Bhattarai, head of the Maoist negotiating </p><p>team, on July 13.  Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman, </p><p>claimed on July 14 that he had no knowledge of the letter. </p><p>However, the local press reported on July 17 that Maoist </p><p>team members were meeting in the mid-western district of </p><p>Bardiya to discuss the letter.  Security forces reportedly </p><p>are suspicious of the apparent "closed-door" session and </p><p>have speculated that a high command meeting was actually </p><p>being held with Prachanda, Maoist chairman, and Bhattarai </p><p>present as well.  Maoist cadres in the region have denied </p><p>any knowledge of the whereabouts of the top two leaders. </p><p>(Note:  Bhattarai continues to remain absent from the public </p><p>spotlight, and speculation remains that he is in India.  End </p><p>Note). </p><p> </p><p>3.  As the fragility of the peace process becomes more </p><p>evident, concern over impending violence grows.  An article </p><p>published on July 17 by a pro-monarchy weekly English </p><p>language newspaper quotes a Maoist source as saying that the </p><p>Maoists used the ceasefire to "reorganize their party," and </p><p>are now equipped with "a good stock of arms."  The source </p><p>further claims that not only are Maoist leaders using India </p><p>as a safehaven, but are also receiving intelligence </p><p>information from India\'s external intelligence agency, the </p><p>Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY STEPPED UP </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The local press reported on July 15 that the GON is </p><p>stepping up security due to what an army official called </p><p>"suspicious activities" by Maoist cadres.  The unnamed </p><p>source alleged that the insurgents have dramatically </p><p>increased their movements, acquired more arms, and stepped </p><p>up extortion demands.  The newspaper also quoted the army </p><p>official as saying that the Maoist leaders have gone </p><p>underground, and there was no way to "ensure that they will </p><p>return to the talks table."  Armed Police Force (APF) </p><p>personnel reportedly have resumed nighttime security </p><p>patrols, and increased security checks along routes </p><p>frequented by Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Amid speculation over the disappearance of Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai, the GON has increased security in many of the mid- </p><p>western districts, and imposed a curfew in the mid-western </p><p>district of Dang, a Maoist stronghold and scene of a deadly </p><p>attack on an army base in 2002.  The decision comes after </p><p>reports that Bhattarai allegedly used an ambulance in Dang </p><p>to facilitate the transport of arms and ammunition to </p><p>Maoists in that region. </p><p> </p><p>6.  A curfew imposed by security personnel in the western </p><p>district of Syangja will continue to be enforced despite </p><p>objections from residents.  District officials said the </p><p>curfew is necessary in light of continued security threats. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS TRANSPORTING ARMS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  The local press reported on July 14 that Maoists in the </p><p>far western district of Kailali are importing weapons from </p><p>points along the Nepal-India border.  According to security </p><p>forces, the insurgents are working with the People\'s War </p><p>Group (PWG) and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC), Indian </p><p>extremist groups.  Papers linking the insurgents to the </p><p>Indian Maoist groups reportedly were confiscated along with </p><p>weapons and ammunition. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Maoists in Kavre, a district east of Kathmandu, </p><p>reportedly have declared the region as a base.  According to </p><p>July 11 press reports, Maoist cadres have sealed the borders </p><p>of the district and do not allow new people to enter. </p><p>Maoist cadres reportedly claim that they are preparing to </p><p>fight a "people\'s war" against "imperialistic forces." </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS RELEASED </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  In yet another concession to Maoist demands, the GON </p><p>released the three remaining Maoist Central Committee </p><p>Members from prison on July 12.  Maoists had demanded the </p><p>release of all five of their Central Committee Members as a </p><p>precondition of peace talks, but previously only two had </p><p>been released.  The move is an apparent effort to entice the </p><p>Maoists to return to the negotiating table for a third round </p><p>of talks. </p><p> </p><p>10.  On July 17 Bharat Dhungana, the Secretary of the </p><p>Maoists\' office in Kathmandu, alleged that he was </p><p>handcuffed, blindfolded and held for five hours by security </p><p>forces.  Dhungana claims that five people in civilian </p><p>clothes questioned him on the whereabouts of senior Maoist </p><p>leaders, on their plans regarding participation in a third </p><p>round of talks, and extortion demands by the insurgents. </p><p>Dhungana said his "arrest" would hinder the return of Maoist </p><p>leaders to the capital as they would be unsure of their own </p><p>security.  On that same day, a team of security forces </p><p>reportedly arrested fourteen armed Maoists, including four </p><p>women, in Dolakha District while on routine patrol. </p><p>Security forces confiscated explosives from the insurgents </p><p>and militia uniforms. </p><p> </p><p>11.  On July 15 fourteen Maoist cadres were released from </p><p>detention in Panchthar District. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS ABDUCT RNA SOLDIERS; </p><p>VIOLATIONS CONTINUE TO RISE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  Two unarmed RNA soldiers reportedly were abducted by </p><p>Maoists on July 9 in Makwanpur District.  The Defense </p><p>Ministry condemned the Maoists\' action as "inhuman </p><p>irresponsible behavior," and has demanded the immediate </p><p>release of the soldiers. </p><p> </p><p>13.  A group of Maoists reportedly killed a district </p><p>committee member of the Communist Party of Nepal-United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) on July 15 in Butwal District. </p><p>The activist was returning home when the insurgents </p><p>allegedly stabbed him to death. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Maoists reportedly abducted two youths on July 12 in </p><p>Makwanpur District.  The youths were tied up and taken to an </p><p>undisclosed location.  On July 13 the registrar of the </p><p>District Soil Conservation Office in Gulmi District was </p><p>abducted by insurgents.  On that same day in Jajarkot </p><p>District, Maoists abducted a police constable and a Village </p><p>Development Committee (VDC) secretary.  Both men remain </p><p>missing. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Two powerful pipe bombs were found on the ground floor </p><p>of a court in Siraha District on July 15.  The bombs are </p><p>similar to those normally planted by Maoist insurgents </p><p>during the insurgency, although no one has claimed </p><p>responsibility. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Citizenship certificates distributed during RNA health </p><p>camps, which Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman, </p><p>publicly condemned on July 14 as a ploy to disrupt talks, </p><p>have been confiscated by Maoists in Banke District.  The </p><p>insurgents, who have attempted to disrupt the health camps </p><p>numerous times in the past, confiscated the cards after the </p><p>RNA team departed. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
