<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001215 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR, EXIM, OPIC </p><p>ABIDJAN ALSO FOR USED/AFDB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ETRD, EINV, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON STRATEGY FOR THE U.S. BILATERAL PARIS </p><p>AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1194 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Director General of the Debt Management Office </p><p>(DMO) Akin Arikawe April 8 explained that Nigeria no longer </p><p>wanted to sign its bilateral Paris Club agreement with the </p><p>USG until negotiations (with more favorable terms for </p><p>Nigeria) were completed with the UK and Japan.  Arikawe </p><p>stressed the logic of the GON\'s delaying tactics for Paris </p><p>Club Agreements, and repeated his interest in exploring </p><p>debt-for-nature swaps with the USG.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>THE WAITING GAME </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Econ Officer April 8 called on DMO\'s Director General </p><p>Akin Arikawe to discuss the April 5 Supreme Court Decision on </p><p>Resource Allocation (reported reftel).  Arikawe produced a </p><p>copy of a March 19, 2002 letter to Mrs. F. M. Yemidale, </p><p>Secretary of the Nigerian Debt Conversion Committee, from </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Michael Kaplan of the Treasury Department\'s Office of </p><p>International Debt Policy. Kaplan wrote, "there are some </p><p>outstanding issues that hinder our efforts to move forward on </p><p>the debt swap.  U.S. and Nigeria have not yet signed the </p><p>bilateral agreement implementing the terms of the 2000 Paris </p><p>Club rescheduling for Nigeria.  In addition, Nigeria has </p><p>accumulated payments arrears to the U.S. Government." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Arikawe saw the letter as a terse brush off, and that </p><p>Nigeria -- for ecological as well as political reasons -- </p><p>wanted to pursue environmental debt swaps.  EconOff reminded </p><p>Arikawe that Ambassador Jeter had already raised with him (as </p><p>well as the Minister of Finance and the Vice President) USG </p><p>concerns about delays with the bilateral agreement.  If </p><p>Nigeria\'s real goals were debt rescheduling and eventually a </p><p>significant debt write off, current dilatory tactics holding </p><p>out for the most optimal term was costing the Nigerian </p><p>government money and the opportunity for progress on a number </p><p>of fronts including debt swaps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The DMO DG claimed satisfaction with the USG terms on the </p><p>bilateral debt agreement, but did not want to complete the </p><p>agreement until Nigeria had reached better terms with the </p><p>U.K. and Japan on these debts.  If the U.S. agreement were </p><p>filed in Paris now, the Europeans would insist on similar </p><p>terms.  He noted  the size of Nigerian debt to the USG was </p><p>relatively small, about a seventh the size of the UK\'s and </p><p>only half the amount owed to the Dutch, one of the smaller </p><p>European donors.  He insisted terms of the agreement with the </p><p>U.S should not be the ruler by which the other agreements are </p><p>measured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Arikawe felt the UK and Japanese agreements should come </p><p>soon.  With the Japanese and UK on board in the near future, </p><p>and the German agreement already in the final stages, more </p><p>than 60% of the debt would have been negotiated.  At that </p><p>point, Nigeria would look to finishing the U.S. bilateral. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>GON STILL WANTS DEBT FOR NATURE SWAP </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Nigeria was still very interested in a debt for nature </p><p>swap; Arikawe repeated his assertion that securing a </p><p>private-sector third party would not be a problem.  He asked </p><p>that we contact Michael Kaplan and see if he could arrange </p><p>meetings at Treasury for Mrs. Yemidale on the margins of this </p><p>year\'s IMF/World Bank spring meetings.  She wanted to begin </p><p>work on a Nigerian plan to be ready when, "in the near </p><p>future," Nigeria returns to normal relations with the Paris </p><p>Club and the IMF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>JAPANESE AND UK PERSPECTIVES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The Japanese Embassy informs us that an agreement on </p><p>Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) debt is ready to sign, </p><p>and they are preparing an Exchange of Notes to split that </p><p>agreement from Japanese commercial debt.  This would allow </p><p>for a formal signing on ODA debt while the two sides continue </p><p>to negotiate a mutually acceptable interest rate for the </p><p>commercial loans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. A British High Commission Economics Officer reports </p><p>progress in negotiating interest rates and grace periods. </p><p>The remaining sticking point is Nigerian insistence on </p><p>applying payments to principal before interest.  Arikawe told </p><p>UK negotiators that the GON would make payments only to those </p><p>countries with which it had signed bilateral agreements. </p><p>Were Nigeria to honor its debt payments in full, the UK would </p><p>receive $550 million this year.  This obviously is not going </p><p>to happen, but the UK is inclined to "cut their losses and </p><p>move forward" with an agreement that brings in something. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>9.  In the wake of our insistence on adhering to the standard </p><p>terms of the bilateral agreement, the Nigerians evidently </p><p>have done a negotiation volte-face.  Previously, Arikawe had </p><p>execution of the U.S agreement at the head of the list, now </p><p>it is the tail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>WHEN MIGHT THE U.S. BILATERAL BE READY? </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. The international donor community and IFIs are convenient </p><p>targets for venting nationalistic spleen, and President </p><p>Obasanjo has recently taken a few rhetorical shots at the IMF </p><p>in the local and international press.  At the same time, one </p><p>of candidate Obasanjo\'s selling points in 1999 was his </p><p>stature with the international community.  He may want to </p><p>package these mostly technical agreements as diplomatic </p><p>accomplishments in the build up to the election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Even if the Administration wants to accelerate the </p><p>process, it may not go as fast as they want.  On Christmas </p><p>Eve Arikawe held a press conference announcing signings with </p><p>three countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland.  Today, </p><p>two of those countries have still not signed.  Added to this </p><p>is the DMO\'s new task of assigning external debt to </p><p>individual states (reported septel).  Assuming Arikawe is </p><p>sincere that the GON will stop stalling as a tactic (which is </p><p>uncertain -- and certainly not within his control), his shop </p><p>may still lack the capacity to conclude agreements as quickly </p><p>as he may hope. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
