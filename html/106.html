<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 01587 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PGOV, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: KHAMENEI\'S VISIT: RESURGENCE OF SHIA EXTREMISM? </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY: THE SUCCESSFUL (FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE) </p><p>VISIT OF KHAMENEI TO PAKISTAN HAS BOOSTED THE MORALE OF </p><p>THE RADICAL SHIA GROUPS HERE. APPARENTLY FLUSH WITH NEW </p><p>FUNDS, THE SHIAS HAVE BEGUN MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH </p><p>THE ANTI-GOP, ANTI-US OPPOSITION, PARTICULARLY OVER </p><p>LIBYA. SUCH CAUSES EVOKE LITTLE PUBLIC SYMPATHY, AND </p><p>THE ATTITUDES OF THE SUNNI MAJORITY -- MANY OF WHOM </p><p>HAVE BEGUN TO LOOK UPON ANY SIGNS OF SHIA ASSERTIVENESS </p><p>WITH SUSPICION AND DISTASTE -- WILL CONTINUE TO LIMIT </p><p>THE ABILITY OF THE RADICAL SHIAS TO PURSUE SPECIFICALLY </p><p>SECTARIAN GOALS. HOWEVER, SHIA EXTREMISTS WILL </p><p>DOUBTLESS SEEK TO EXPLOIT ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR FANNING </p><p>ANTI-AMERICANISM AMONG THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. A HEATING </p><p>UP OF THE AL QUDS EPISODE WOULD TURN ALL GROUPS AGAINST </p><p>US.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE KHAMENEI VISIT </p><p> </p><p>2. ONE WORRISOME ASPECT OF THE RECENT VISIT OF IRANIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT KHAMENEI TO PAKISTAN HAS BEEN THE APPARENT </p><p>NEW LEASE ON LIFE IT HAS GIVEN TO RADICAL SHIA </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS HERE. PAKISTANI SHIAS CLEARLY VIEWED THE </p><p>VISIT PRIMARILY AS A SECTARIAN ONE, AND THE COMMUNITY </p><p>AS A WHOLE WENT ALL OUT TO ENSURE KHAMENEI\'S WELCOME </p><p>WAS A WARM ONE. HUGE THRONGS OF SHIAS WERE BUSED TO THE </p><p>AIRPORTS IN LAHORE AND ISLAMABAD TO GREET KHAMENEI AND </p><p>WELCOMING POSTERS SPRUNG UP IN THE MAJOR CITIES OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE MONEY FOR THIS MAJOR EFFORT APPARENTLY CAME FROM </p><p>TWO SOURCES: WEALTHY PAKISTANI SHIAS AND THE IRANIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT. THE FUNDS WERE FUNNELED PRIMARILY THROUGH </p><p>TWO RADICAL SHIA ORGANIZATIONS, THE TEHRIK-E-NIFAZ-E- </p><p>FIQH-E-JAFFRIA AND THE IMAMIA STUDENTS ORGANIZATION </p><p>(ISO). THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAD BEEN IN THE </p><p>FOREFRONT OF THE SECTARIAN AGITATION LAST YEAR. </p><p>HOWEVER, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- PERHAPS INCLUDING </p><p>THE FEAR OF A SUNNI BACKLASH -- THEY HAD BEEN </p><p>RELATIVELY QUIET FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>4. IN UTILIZING THE NEW FUNDS AVAILABLE, THE EXTREMIST </p><p>SHIAS ENSURED THAT KHAMENEI\'S WELCOME TOOK ON A </p><p>RADICAL, ANTI-GOP, ANTI-US TINGE. THE CROWDS CHANTED </p><p>ANTI-AMERICAN SLOGANS, MANY OF THE BANNERS WERE ON AN </p><p>ANTI-AMERICAN THEME, AND A LARGE NUMBER OF SHIAS AT THE </p><p>DEPARTURE CEREMONY OPENLY SHOWED DISRESPECT TO </p><p>PRESIDENT ZIA, SURROUNDING HIS CAR AND MAKING OBSCENE </p><p>GESTURES. </p><p> </p><p>RENEWED SELF-CONFIDENCE </p><p> </p><p>5. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE KHAMENEI VISIT, THE RADICAL </p><p>SHIAS APPEAR MORE SELF-CONFIDENT THAN THEY HAVE IN </p><p>MONTHS. SINCE KHAMENEI\'S DEPARTURE, THE ISO HAS BEEN </p><p>PARTICULARLY ACTIVE IN SUPPORTING THE FLURRY OF </p><p>ANTI-AMERICAN, PRO-LIBYAN RALLIES WHICH OPPOSITION </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE ORGANIZED THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>COUNTRY. THESE RALLIES HAVE NOT STRUCK A POPULAR CHORD </p><p>-- ATTENDANCE HAS ALMOST UNIFORMLY BEEN SMALL -- BUT </p><p>THE AMOUNT OF ORGANIZATIONAL EFFORT WHICH HAS GONE INTO </p><p>THEM AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE POPPED UP ALL OVER THE </p><p>COUNTRY MAKES THIS PHENOMENON NOTEWORTHY. </p><p> </p><p>LIMITS </p><p> </p><p>6. THE ACTIVITIES OF THE RADICAL SHIA ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO BE LIMITED BY TWO FACTORS: </p><p>THE  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND FEAR OF A SUNNI </p><p>BACKLASH. THE RECENT ACTIVISM OF THE RADICAL SHIAS </p><p>APPEARS TO BE A MANIFESTATION NOT ONLY OF EUPHORIA </p><p>FOLLOWING THE KHAMENEI VISIT, BUT ALSO OF A GREATER </p><p>AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. THE MONEY BEING SPENT NOW --MUCH </p><p>OF WHICH PRESUMABLY IS LEFT-OVER FROM THE VISIT -- WILL </p><p>HAVE TO BE REPLENISHED IF THE SHIAS ARE TO MAINTAIN </p><p>THEIR CURRENT LEVEL OF ACTIVITY. THE ATTITUDE OF THE </p><p>IRANIAN GOVERNMENT -- THE MOST LIKELY PAYMASTER -- WILL </p><p>THEN BECOME CRUCIAL -- WILL THE IRANIANS RISK </p><p>ANTAGONIZING THE GOP TO PLAY THEIR OWN SECTARIAN GAMES </p><p>IN PAKISTAN? </p><p> </p><p>7. GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC IMBALANCE -- AND THE GROWING </p><p>INTOLERANCE OF SHIA "DEMANDS" BY THE VAST SUNNI </p><p>MAJORITY, THE SHIAS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PURSUE </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY A SPECIFICALLY SHIA AGENDA. INDEED, THE </p><p>LEVEL OF GRUMBLING AMONGST THE SUNNIS ABOUT THE SHIAS </p><p>HAS NOTICEABLY RISEN AS A RESULT OF A PERCEPTION THAT </p><p>THE SHIAS "HIJACKED" KHAMENEI\'S VISIT FOR THEIR OWN </p><p>PURPOSES AND ARE -- ONCE AGAIN -- GROWING UPPITY. </p><p>PRESIDENT ZIA HIMSELF IS REPORTEDLY ENRAGED BY HIS </p><p>TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF KHAMENEI\'S WELL-WISHERS AND </p><p>HAS TOLD THE SECURITY FORCES TO CHECK CLOSELY INTO THE </p><p>OPERATIONS --AND FUNDING -- OF THE RADICAL SHIAS. </p><p> </p><p>8. PRESUMABLY, A RECOGNITION THAT THEY CAN NOT AFFORD </p><p>TO GO IT ALONE AT LEAST PARTIALLY EXPLAINS WHY THE </p><p>RADICAL SHIAS ARE INCREASINGLY MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH </p><p>THE EXTRA-PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION AND IN PARTICULAR </p><p>HAVE LASHED ON TO THE LIBYAN CAUSE AS TOOL FOR </p><p>AMERICAN-BASHING. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE, THE MOVEMENT FOR THE </p><p>RESTORARTION OF DEMOCRACY (MRD), HAS BEEN WILLING TO </p><p>MAKE COMMON CAUSE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE </p><p>SHIAS. IN SOME WAYS, THIS IS A NATURAL ALLIANCE OF </p><p>GROUPS ON THE OUTS WITH THE PRESENT SYSTEM. FOR THE </p><p>MRD, HOWEVER, THE SHIAS REPRESENT A TWO-EDGED SWORD: </p><p>SHIA EXTREMISTS MIGHT HIJACK THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR THEIR OWN RADICAL PURPOSES, THEREBY </p><p>ALIENATING MUCH OF THE MRD\'S CONSTITUENCY (MANY OF WHOM </p><p>ARE FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE SUNNIS). </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>10.  FOR THE MOMENT, THE TACTIS OF THE RADICAL SHIAS </p><p>APPEAR UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED:  THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS </p><p>FAIRLY FIRMLY IN THE SADDLE, AT LEAST OVER THE SHORT </p><p>TERM; AND COLONEL QADDHAFI\'S CAUSE EVOKES LITTLE PUBLIC </p><p>SYMPATHY -- TOO MANY PAKISTANIS CONSIDER HIM A </p><p>TERRORIST. IF, HOWEVER, AN ANTI-AMERICAN CAUSE ARISES </p><p>AROUND WHICH A LARGER SECTION OF THE PAKISTANI POPULACE </p><p>CAN UNITE -- AND EVENTS SUCH AS RECENTLY HAPPENED AT </p><p>THE AL-AQSA MOSQUE COULD PROVE TO BE SUCH A CATALYST -- </p><p>THE RADICAL SHIAS WILL NO DOUBT DO ALL THEY CAN TO TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINTON </p><p></p></div>
