<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002515 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, ECIN, MARR, UG, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT MUSEVENI SPEAKS ON AFRICAN </p><p>INTEGRATION AT THE WAR COLLEGE </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  President Yoweri Museveni, guest lecturer at the </p><p>Nigerian National War College on September 17, was billed to </p><p>speak to the filled hall about regional integration.  His </p><p>well-received speech focused largely on globalization as the </p><p>driving force for integration.   Museveni argued that states </p><p>and supranational structures of significantly large </p><p>population groups would give Africa the might necessary to </p><p>demand trade rights and access to global markets.  However, </p><p>he warned, Africa must eschew religious, ethnic and tribal </p><p>conflicts that prevent integration and economic development. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  President Yoweri Museveni, accompanied on the dais by </p><p>Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Chief of Defense Staff Ibrahim </p><p>Ogohi, Chief of Naval Staff Afolayan, Chief of Air Staff </p><p>Wuyep, Senator Udo Udoma and the NWC Commandant Rear Admiral </p><p>HL Okpanachi, gave the inauguration lecture for Course 10 at </p><p>the Nigerian National War College on September 17.  Course 10 </p><p>includes students from Benin, Burkina-Faso, Niger, Togo, and </p><p>for the first time, Uganda and France. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  While integration was the main point of Museveni\'s paper, </p><p>dubbed "Why Uganda? Why Nigeria?  Why the African Union?", he </p><p>identified globalization as the impetus for integration (the </p><p>speech sounded remarkably similar to many recent Thomas </p><p>Friedman columns).  First, Museveni launched into an </p><p>anthropological discussion of the value-added of larger </p><p>political units; states versus tribes.  (Museveni must have </p><p>also recently read Jared Diamond\'s book, "Guns, Germs and </p><p>Steel").  He discussed the transition of humanity from </p><p>hunter-gatherers to static agricultural-based societies. </p><p>Museveni argued that these societies had to organize to </p><p>irrigate and therefore developed larger social structures. </p><p>He then asked why development of more complex structures had </p><p>escaped Africa?  Africa\'s low population levels due to </p><p>disease and the high availability of "gatherable" resources </p><p>made it unnecessary for Africans to develop structures more </p><p>complex than tribes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Museveni argued the consolidation of tribes into states </p><p>by colonial powers was largely positive and noted that those </p><p>African leaders who challenged this process were doomed to </p><p>failure by the march of history.  Implying that tribal </p><p>structures were outdated and unhelpful for development, he </p><p>joked, "I have a problem with my Kings in Uganda.  They wear </p><p>feathers and kingly attire, but," he emphasized, "they were </p><p>conquered.  \'Your Majesty, where were you?  I was not a chief </p><p>then?", he asked rhetorically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Rejecting the claims of African apologists railing </p><p>against the history of colonialism and the dissolution of </p><p>tribal structures, Museveni opined that Africa must organize </p><p>larger structures ("at a supra-tribal level") to survive. </p><p>Comparing Uganda to China, and noting that in the last 10 </p><p>years he had become a favorite of the World Bank because </p><p>2,300 new companies had invested in Uganda, Museveni pointed </p><p>out that in the same period, 300,000 new companies had </p><p>invested in China.  Why, he asked?  Because China has two </p><p>billion people, he argued, and companies seek markets.  While </p><p>Uganda could not compete alone (it was too small), and </p><p>individual tribes even less so, larger African groupings </p><p>could and should compete on the world stage.  Provided the </p><p>chauvinisms of tribe and religion were resolved, he </p><p>explained, the 750 million people in the African Union would </p><p>have much stronger diplomatic and economic bargaining power </p><p>(collectively more than the sum of their individual parts). </p><p>Museveni laughed as he noted that he, as a Head of State, </p><p>regularly had to go begging for South Africa\'s support </p><p>whenever he made an international effort because Uganda was </p><p>simply too small to go it alone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Turning to resources and value-added products, Museveni </p><p>recounted that tobacco growers in the West Nile area had </p><p>demanded part of the revenue from taxes on cigarette sales </p><p>since they grew the crops.  He explained to the growers that </p><p>they would not get additional revenue; the consumers buying </p><p>the cigarettes were the real source of the wealth.  Comparing </p><p>this to Nigeria\'s oil revenue allocation debate and arguing </p><p>that the wrong topic was being debated, Museveni emphasized </p><p>that oil was not the wealth of Nigeria, but its large </p><p>population.  Nigeria\'s strength was its human capital and its </p><p>120m strong market, provided that people received education </p><p>and had enough individual wealth to be consumers.  For </p><p>success in development, he stated, one needs three things: </p><p>educated people, fresh water, and arable land.  Dismissing </p><p>the importance of oil, he proclaimed, "Agriculture is the </p><p>everlasting petroleum." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  However, as long as Africans fell victim to </p><p>inter-religious and inter-communal conflicts, Africa would </p><p>not develop as an integrated unit, Museveni emphasized. </p><p>Africa must avoid the kinds of conflict seen in the Middle </p><p>East, Museveni argued.  What do you care if someone else eats </p><p>pork, or is from a different tribe -- what you should care </p><p>about is whether he will buy what you are selling.  But </p><p>instead of talking about trade and access to markets, </p><p>Museveni lamented, Africans are talking about pork. </p><p>Emphasizing his point, Museveni said he had become the first </p><p>Christian in his family in 1947.  However, he flatly stated </p><p>that at the Durban conference on racism, he had declared that </p><p>he was considering returning to his local tribe\'s religion, </p><p>because, "back at my home, we never cared what anyone else </p><p>ate." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. COMMENT:  Somewhat light in its delivery, Museveni\'s </p><p>speech, containing many nuggets for his Nigerian audience was </p><p>well-received.  Nigerian dependence on oil puts the country </p><p>at economic risk should shocks occur in world petroleum </p><p>prices.  Privatization and diversification into non-oil </p><p>sectors have been central tenets of the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration, but globalization and privatization have been </p><p>viewed as strictures imposed by the International Financial </p><p>Institutions and Western states.  Another African leader </p><p>carries more credibility than Western leaders in Nigeria when </p><p>discussing the benefits of free markets.  More importantly, </p><p>Museveni\'s strong statements against inter-communal and </p><p>inter-religious conflict are sorely needed here, as events of </p><p>the past few years in Kaduna, Jos, Lagos and elsewhere have </p><p>clearly and sanguinely demonstrated. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
