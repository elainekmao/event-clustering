<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008126 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU, AM, AJ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA STICKING TO ITS GUNS ON ARMENIA </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reasons: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  In separate meetings last week with EUR/SE Director </p><p>Hengel, MFA officials reiterated standard Turkish concerns in </p><p>relations with Armenia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Deputy Director General for the Caucasus and Central </p><p>Asia Ertan Tezgor told us Turkey will not move to normalize </p><p>relations with Armenia until Yerevan recognizes current </p><p>borders.  "How can Turkey," he asked, "carry out good </p><p>neighborly relations when Armenia occupies 20% of Azeri </p><p>territory?"  Director General for Bilateral Political Affairs </p><p>Ahmet Banguoglu said that the best way for USG to contribute </p><p>positively to Armenian-Turkish relations would be to "control </p><p>the Armenian lobby."  Tezgor echoed Banguoglu, calling </p><p>Armenian American behavior on this issue "childish."  He also </p><p>urged USG to "do something;" otherwise Armenia would fall </p><p>entirely under Russian influence.  Banguoglu added that the </p><p>unresolved situation in Nagorno-Karabakh is a concern to the </p><p>GOT, but of a lesser order given immediate Turkish interest </p><p>in border and "lobby" issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment: These views reflect an MFA in its </p><p>default-mode defensiveness, a condition exacerbated by the </p><p>current, though temporary, uncertainty as to who will be the </p><p>AK Party\'s choice for foreign minister in the next </p><p>government.  We have heard Tezgor try to be more imaginative </p><p>in the past regarding a possible comprehensive </p><p>Turkey-Armenia-Azerbaijan solution; he may have an incentive </p><p>to return to this fresher mode of thinking once the new </p><p>government is in place.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) EUR/SE Director Hengel did not have the opportunity to </p><p>clear this cable. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
