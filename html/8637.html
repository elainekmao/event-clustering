<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HANOI 001437 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ACHAO// </p><p>CDR USPACOM HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL, AND DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ECON, ETRD, EINV, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM: Ongoing evolution of the role of </p><p>attorneys </p><p> </p><p>Ref A)  HANOI 1411 </p><p>Ref B)  HCMC 0499 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  The gradual process of judicial reform </p><p>and development of a "rule-of-law" state in Vietnam have </p><p>contributed to the rise in the prominence of lawyers.  The </p><p>just-concluded Nam Cam trial (ref b) showcased pilot changes </p><p>in court proceedings that are supposed to put defense </p><p>attorneys on a more equal footing with prosecutors.  A </p><p>revision to the Criminal Procedure Code expected to pass the </p><p>National Assembly in December should institutionalize these </p><p>changes and give defendants the right to have an attorney </p><p>present from the time of initial police questioning.  (The </p><p>current system only guarantees access from the time a </p><p>defendant is formally charged -- very late in the </p><p>investigation process.)  Vietnam\'s legal culture has </p><p>traditionally been strongly biased in favor of prosecutors </p><p>and police, and citizens have tended to avoid litigation as </p><p>much as possible.  Continuing and substantial improvements </p><p>in the ability of attorneys to protect the rights of their </p><p>clients will hinge largely on overcoming a system stacked </p><p>against the defense and still dominated by the Communist </p><p>Party.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Judicial Reform, Lawyers, and the "Rule of Law" State </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  "Judicial reform" in Vietnam describes a laborious </p><p>but steady process -- in many cases supported by foreign </p><p>funding -- that is promoting a larger role for lawyers along </p><p>with the development of the overall legal and judicial </p><p>system.  The legal profession does not have a longstanding </p><p>tradition in Vietnam;  there was essentially no formal legal </p><p>training in Vietnam from 1960 until 1979 (ref a). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  According to Professor Luu Van Dat, Vice President </p><p>of the Vietnam Lawyers Association (VLA),  for many years </p><p>after 1945, "People\'s Advocates" (Bao Chua Vien Nhan Dan) </p><p>represented defendants during court trials if approved in </p><p>advance by the court.  The presumption was that anyone with </p><p>common sense -- and, likely, with demonstrated loyalty to </p><p>the Party and state -- ought to be able to handle such </p><p>cases.  Professor Le Hong Hanh, Vice Rector of Hanoi Law </p><p>University (Vietnam\'s largest law school), confirmed to </p><p>poloffs that most judges before 1990 did not even have a law </p><p>degree; they were appointed on the basis of their </p><p>"achievements" (and, presumably, Party record). </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Becoming a Lawyer </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) As war-time concerns faded in the mid- to late- </p><p>1970\'s, the need for legal expertise became increasingly </p><p>apparent, according to several Vietnamese legal experts. </p><p>While there were a handful-- such as the VLA\'s Dat -- who </p><p>had studied under the French prior to 1945, the relatively </p><p>few Vietnamese law students matriculated mostly under </p><p>scholarship in Eastern-bloc countries. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  In 1979, the GVN established Hanoi Law University </p><p>(HLU).  Initially, HLU concentrated on training students who </p><p>would become judges and prosecutors, according to Professor </p><p>Hanh.  The lawyer\'s role was otherwise "very insignificant" </p><p>under central planning, he added.  The shift towards a </p><p>market economy raised the demand for legal training, </p><p>Professor Hanh noted.  Other law faculties were created in </p><p>Ho Chi Minh City, Dalat, Hue, and elsewhere (ref a).  Demand </p><p>for lawyers grew rapidly from 1992 to 1999, but subsequently </p><p>leveled off somewhat. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  HLU, the largest and most prestigious Vietnamese </p><p>law school, currently receives about 38,000 admissions </p><p>applications per year but has a student body of only about </p><p>4000 undergraduates and 300 graduate students.  Professor </p><p>Nguyen Ngoc Chi of the law faculty at Hanoi National </p><p>University (HNU), numbered his students at almost 2000, </p><p>including about 850 part-timers, and 180 graduate students. </p><p>Professor Nguyen Dang Dung at HNU noted that most law </p><p>graduates now expect to work in the commercial sector as </p><p>specialists on contracts and international trade.  Economic </p><p>and commercial law courses are also currently the most </p><p>popular at HLU, because students hope to parlay them into </p><p>jobs in the commercial and private sector, according to </p><p>Professor Hanh.  Demand for these courses outstrips </p><p>available seats, so enrollment is based on academic records </p><p>and admission tests.  However almost all of these courses </p><p>are still taught by Eastern Bloc trained professors who </p><p>themselves have never had international standard training in </p><p>these areas.  As one law student commented to Econ </p><p>Counselor, a Marxist-Leninist teaching commercial law seems </p><p>to defeat the purpose.  Serious students of these subjects </p><p>frequently seek graduate study overseas.  HLU Vice Rector </p><p>Hanh conceded that very few of his faculty members have had </p><p>time for further education.  The U.S.-Vietnam Trade Council </p><p>has obtained private funding to work with the Ministry of </p><p>Justice (MOJ) and several law universities to help develop a </p><p>modern legal curriculum.  Embassy and the USAID-funded </p><p>Support for Trade AcceleRation (STAR) Project are looking </p><p>for ways to complement that work.  Ref A described current </p><p>law school curriculum in detail, including the required dose </p><p>of Communist/Ho Chi Minh ideology and indoctrination about </p><p>relations between the State/Party and the law.  A bachelor\'s </p><p>degree in law is now a requirement to become an attorney, </p><p>prosecutor, or judge; trial attorneys as well as and judges </p><p>and prosecutors now must meet additional requirements. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>The Legal Profession </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Types of Lawyers:  Legal professionals in Vietnam </p><p>are referred to as "luat gia."  They may join the Vietnam </p><p>Lawyers Association (VLA), which now has about 30,000 </p><p>members, according to VLA Vice President Dat.  Their ranks </p><p>range from the GVN\'s Chief Procurator down to minor district </p><p>court functionaries, as well as holders of bachelor\'s </p><p>degrees working in the private sector.  A more specialized </p><p>subset of "luat gia," called "luat su," include primarily </p><p>prosecutors, judges, and trial attorneys.  Dat estimated </p><p>their numbers nationwide at only 2,500; they are also </p><p>eligible for VLA membership. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Bar Association:  The National Assembly Standing </p><p>Committee authorized the Vietnam Bar Association\'s </p><p>establishment in 1987.  However, it was only in 2002 that </p><p>Vietnam instituted an exam for admission to the Bar, after </p><p>the NASC revised the Bar\'s statute (authorizing ordinance) </p><p>in 2001.  Several hundred would-be attorneys took the first </p><p>exam in 2002.  All must first take a six-month bar exam </p><p>preparation course at a Ministry of Justice training school </p><p>(ref a), following graduation from a university-level law </p><p>faculty.  Since the requirement is new, the course\'s </p><p>curriculum is still under development, according to HNU\'s </p><p>Dung, who added that the course had been weighted towards </p><p>criminal law procedures.  There has been considerable </p><p>debate, according to Professor Dung, over both the course\'s </p><p>content and the methods used to teach it.  According to the </p><p>school\'s director, Dr. Phan Huu Thu, the school charges </p><p>tuition (he declined to reveal the amount), but the GVN pays </p><p>for attendees who are already GVN cadres.  Bar association </p><p>membership increased dramatically from about 1,800 in 2001 </p><p>to the current level near 2,500 (still only 1 bar member per </p><p>32,000 inhabitants).  The VLU\'s Dat explained this by </p><p>recognizing "we need more attorneys."  Only two years ago, </p><p>the Vietnam Bar Association spoke of the need to ensure the </p><p>"quality" of attorneys when explaining why membership was so </p><p>limited and was essentially "by invitation" only (usually </p><p>based on Party service).  Not all VBA members are welcoming </p><p>this change to an at least nominally merit-based system. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Legal Careers:  Before 1994-5, the GVN employed </p><p>almost all law school graduates, according to Professor </p><p>Hanh.  Since then, however, most graduates have gravitated </p><p>instead to the private sector, with its generally better </p><p>salaries and benefits.  The VLA\'s Dat said that the majority </p><p>of those who become trial attorneys specialize in criminal </p><p>law.  The remainder practice civil law, especially related </p><p>to family, marriage, land, and property issues.  There are </p><p>"a few" administrative lawyers, who primarily handle </p><p>complaints against the state.  (Note:  recently-passed </p><p>legislation to help victims of injustice obtain redress from </p><p>the state may lead shortly to an increase in these numbers, </p><p>although many questions remain about the implementation of </p><p>that law, as septel will describe.  End note.)  Dat added </p><p>that there is an even smaller number of economic, trade and </p><p>commercial law specialists, and only "four or five" </p><p>Vietnamese intellectual property rights attorneys.  Some GVN </p><p>ministries face a serious shortage of qualified attorneys. </p><p>The Ministry of Trade, for example, has no practicing </p><p>qualified trade attorneys.  Almost all Vietnamese lawyers </p><p>practicing in these areas have obtained additional training </p><p>abroad, primarily in Australia and the U.S. </p><p>10.  (U)  According to various contacts, most Vietnamese </p><p>citizens associated courts and attorneys only with </p><p>"criminal" activities and charges, and thus tried to avoid </p><p>them as much as possible.  There is also a widespread </p><p>assumption, especially among urban residents, that the </p><p>courts are tools of the Party and State and that average </p><p>defendants or plaintiffs are at a disadvantage.  Rumors of </p><p>corruption among judges also lessen popular confidence in </p><p>court proceedings.  The idea that attorneys can be involved </p><p>with economic and commercial issues is particularly </p><p>"unfamiliar" to most Vietnamese, according to the VLA\'s Dat. </p><p>The clients of the few existing economic and commercial </p><p>lawyers are almost exclusively foreign entities, he added. </p><p>Many Vietnamese citizens prefer -- if absolutely necessary - </p><p>- to use "arbitrators" instead of lawyers.  There are about </p><p>100 such GVN-licensed arbitrators, including Dat himself. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>A Sea Change in the Making? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  However, integration with the rest of the world is </p><p>now changing how Vietnamese view lawyers, Dat claimed.  An </p><p>extremely important change, he commented, relates to </p><p>criminal lawyers.  The current Criminal Procedure Code does </p><p>not adequately protect the rights of defendants, according </p><p>to Dat, although it does formally stipulate that they are </p><p>not deemed guilty until convicted.  As ref b reported, the </p><p>Nam Cam case was one of several pilot cases testing new </p><p>court procedures.  The most important development was the </p><p>growing equality of defense attorneys and prosecutors in </p><p>front of the judge.   Dat pointed out that this would not be </p><p>easy for prosecutors, who have long been used to being in </p><p>the driver\'s seat in the courtroom.  Judges too, still need </p><p>to learn how to moderate the debate and will "make mistakes" </p><p>for some time to come, he predicted. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  The National Assembly debated revisions to the </p><p>Criminal Procedure Code during its ongoing session, and </p><p>expects to pass the revised Code at its next session in </p><p>December.  According to Dat and press reports, the code\'s </p><p>new draft contains language that would institutionalize </p><p>these pilot changes in trial procedures, including a </p><p>requirement that individuals have access to an attorney from </p><p>the beginning of a case, i.e., at the time of initial </p><p>questioning by police.  (Currently, attorneys only gain </p><p>access after the prosecution and police conclude their </p><p>formal investigation, which can take months or more than a </p><p>year.)  The Procuracy took the lead in drafting of the new </p><p>Criminal Procedure Code, but Dat noted that the VLA had been </p><p>formally invited to comment on the draft.  While he admitted </p><p>that the Procuracy will find the "psychology" of these </p><p>procedural -- and conceptual --changes "difficult," he </p><p>claimed that many in the Procuracy were "quite progressive" </p><p>on the issue. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  Toward the end of the Nam Cam trial, different </p><p>local newspapers carried stories about statements reportedly </p><p>made by some defense attorneys.  At least one article in a </p><p>police-owned newspaper called for the prosecution of one </p><p>defense attorney who had attacked the methods and </p><p>credibility of some of the investigating officers in the Nam </p><p>Cam case.  Other articles, including one written by a </p><p>retired Supreme Court Chief judge and another on behalf of </p><p>the Bar Association, defended the legality of the lawyers\' </p><p>actions, although they admitted that the tactics were rather </p><p>"difficult" to accept. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Foreign lawyers:  As previously reported, over the </p><p>last few years the GVN has realized through its attempts to </p><p>implement the U.S-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement and the </p><p>World Bank and IMF agreements, that legal reform underpins </p><p>its entire reform effort.    Vietnam\'s BTA obligations are </p><p>now also a major driving force behind reform of the legal </p><p>profession in Vietnam.  The BTA calls for liberalization on </p><p>restrictions on activities of U.S law firms.  The MOJ, with </p><p>significant assistance from STAR, is currently revising the </p><p>1998 decree that regulates the operation of foreign law </p><p>firms and lawyers in Vietnam.  Revision of this decree is </p><p>intended to bring Vietnam into closer compliance with its </p><p>BTA commitments to liberalize the legal services sector and </p><p>bring Vietnamese law into closer harmony with international </p><p>law and practice. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  The current draft of the revised law on foreign </p><p>lawyers does expand the scope of foreign lawyers activities </p><p>but still restricts them and Vietnamese lawyers who work for </p><p>them from actually arguing cases in court even if the </p><p>Vietnamese lawyer has passed the Bar.  Contacts in the legal </p><p>profession have indicated that the VBA is pushing for this </p><p>continued restriction in order to force foreign law firms to </p><p>partner with a domestic firm in order to take cases to </p><p>court. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  Comment:  The role of lawyers is very slowly </p><p>evolving closer to international norms, to what appears to </p><p>be the clear satisfaction of as least some in the Vietnam </p><p>Lawyers Association and among the ranks of Hanoi\'s law </p><p>professors.  Other elements, including the police and </p><p>probably some judges, likely remain uncomfortable with the </p><p>greater legal and procedural complexities these developments </p><p>will represent.  The USG has in previous Human Rights </p><p>Dialogues called on the GVN to allow defendants to have </p><p>access to attorneys from the time of detention; the proposed </p><p>revised Criminal Procedure Code would be a welcome step </p><p>forward if adopted by the NA, as is probable given the </p><p>publicity devoted to the current debate.  One big question </p><p>will be the willingness of the Communist Party of Vietnam to </p><p>end its behind-the-scenes oversight of the court system and </p><p>allow the kind of more genuinely independent legal system up </p><p>to international standards that Vietnam needs to accelerate </p><p>its integration into the international economy and to </p><p>attract additional foreign investment. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
