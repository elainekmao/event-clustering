<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 001900 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/CEN AND CA/OCS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, CASC, ASEC, KDEM, PINR, PINS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: FRG ORGANIZES VIOLENT PROTESTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1888 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador J.R. Hamilton for reason 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In response to a major legal reversal in Rios </p><p>Montt\'s bid for the Presidency (reftel), thousands of </p><p>well-organized Rios Montt supporters took to the streets of </p><p>the capital on July 24, closing off strategic intersections </p><p>with burning tires.  Mobs have targeted opposition newspapers </p><p>as well as surrounding the Constitutional and Supreme Court </p><p>buildings.  One journalist is confirmed dead from a heart </p><p>attack as he was covering events.  Another was beaten and </p><p>doused with gasoline before being pulled to safety.  The GOG </p><p>has been slow to mobilize police resources and the Ambassador </p><p>has called President Portillo, Minister of Interior Calderon </p><p>and Foreign Minister Gutierrez, to urge restoration of order. </p><p> Portillo announced at 3:00 PM that he has ordered combined </p><p>police/military elements to restore order.  A warden message </p><p>has been transmitted, visa applicants were sent home, </p><p>services for Amcits continue, but we will be on an "essential </p><p>staff" basis July 25.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On the morning of July 24, pro-Rios Montt protesters </p><p>launched coordinated actions across the city.  The mobs, </p><p>which include thugs in ski masks armed with guns, molotov </p><p>cocktails, and sticks initially targeted the opposition news </p><p>media and the offices of opposition financier Dionisio </p><p>Gutierrez.  Buses are reported to be bringing more protesters </p><p>in from the countryside.  Mobs are reported to be forming </p><p>outside the Constitutional Court building, vowing not to </p><p>leave until Rios Montt is registered as a candidate.  Another </p><p>group has taken positions outside a single-gated residential </p><p>community where numerous politicians and diplomats, including </p><p>U.S. Mission personnel, live.  The protesters vow to block </p><p>the entrance for at least three days and have set up tents </p><p>and are passing out food.  Human Rights Ombudsman, Sergio </p><p>Morales has been threatened and has abandoned his office. </p><p>The Ministry of Education has recommended all classes be </p><p>canceled tomorrow.  The Bi-National Center has also closed. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In response to reports that police were withdrawing </p><p>from areas where protesters were gathering, the Ambassador </p><p>twice informed Minister of Interior Calderon that the Embassy </p><p>would be harshly critical if the police allowed the mobs to </p><p>become violent or if the situation descended into general </p><p>disorder.  During the second conversation, Calderon told the </p><p>Ambassador he was sending reinforcements to the offices of </p><p>newspapers Siglo 21 and El Periodico as well as to the </p><p>business center that seem to be most threatened.  Shortly </p><p>thereafter, Foreign Minister Gutierrez told the Ambassador he </p><p>would seek to promote a gentleman\'s agreement for keeping a </p><p>lid on the situation once the immediate situation is </p><p>contained.  Gutierrez said President Portillo supports the </p><p>idea.  At 3:00 PM, state television broadcast a Portillo </p><p>announcement pledging to restore public order through a </p><p>combined police/military response.  In a telephone </p><p>conversation with the Ambassador, Portillo offered to focus </p><p>police attention on disturbances in residential areas and </p><p>said he would appeal to the FRG leadership to turn the </p><p>disturbances off. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Earlier, on the evening of July 23, the Ambassador </p><p>spoke with FRG Congressman Aristides Crespo to urge the FRG </p><p>to resist the temptation to engage in public disorder in </p><p>response to the court decision.  A testy Crespo denied that </p><p>any mobilization was centrally planned, and pointedly refused </p><p>to commit to the need for protests to remain peaceful. </p><p>During the morning commute of July 24, Embassy officers noted </p><p>a large number of portable toilets had appeared overnight in </p><p>a park over a major intersection.  Other officers heard </p><p>reports of trucks laden with food and water circulating in </p><p>areas where demonstrations later "spontaneously occurred." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Embassy has not been targeted in any of the </p><p>disturbances.  Employees have restricted their movements, </p><p>security forces have been pulled inside the fence line to </p><p>prevent accidental encounters with protesters.  Approximately </p><p>150 visa applicants were given new appointments and sent </p><p>home.  A warden message advising Amcits of the situation has </p><p>been cleared with CA and transmitted.  Amcits still have </p><p>access to the Embassy building.  The EAC convened at 2:30 PM </p><p>local time and developed staffing plans, alternate lodging </p><p>for those living in affected areas, and considered ways to </p><p>reunite separated families.  We will operate with only </p><p>essential staff on July 25. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
