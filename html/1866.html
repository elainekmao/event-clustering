(U) ON AUGUST 6, SENATE STAFFDEL, LED BY GARRETT </p><p>GRIGSBY, MET WITH SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT AND ZANU-PF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02379  01 OF 02  101014Z </p><p>SECRETARY OF ADMINISTRATION EMMERSON MNANGAGWA IN HIS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PARLIAMENT OFFICES.  MNANGAGWA WAS JOINED BY DEPUTY </p><p>CLERK OF PARLIAMENT HELEN DINGANI, AND THE STAFFDEL WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY CHARGE AUBREY HOOKS AND POLOFFS. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MNANGAGWA BEGAN BY EMPHASIZING THAT HE IS NOT A </p><p>GOVERNMENT MINISTER; NONETHELESS, AS SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT, HE FOLLOWS GOVERNMENT ISSUES.  HE ITERATED </p><p>THAT NEXT YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE HELD IN </p><p>MARCH OR APRIL.  THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) HAS </p><p>HAD FIVE GENERAL ELECTIONS SINCE INDEPENDENCE, AND IT </p><p>WILL NOT MISS THIS ELECTORAL DATE, EITHER.  HE DESCRIBED </p><p>THE BASIC ELECTORAL PROCESS, AND MENTIONED THE THREE BY- </p><p>ELECTIONS HELD SINCE LATE LAST YEAR.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE BINDURA BY-ELECTION AS "LESS VIOLENT" </p><p>THAN THE PREVIOUS TWO BECAUSE THE POLICE HAD SET UP </p><p>ROADBLOCKS AT POINTS LEADING INTO THE DISTRICT AND </p><p>SEARCHED FOR WEAPONS.  THE ATTACK ON MDC PRESIDENT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S CONVOY WAS A "SMALL INCIDENT" IN AN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OTHERWISE PEACEFUL DISTRICT.  IN RESPONSE TO A STAFFDEL </p><p>QUESTION ABOUT THE VIOLENCE SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE IN </p><p>BINDURA, MNANGAGWA SAID THE MDC AND ZANU-PF HAVE AGREED </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A CODE OF CONDUCT BASED ON COMMONWEALTH AND </p><p>EU CODES OF CONDUCT.  A TEAM OF FIVE ZANU-PF MEMBERS AND </p><p>FIVE MDC MEMBERS ARE EXAMINING WAYS TO REDUCE VIOLENCE, </p><p>INCLUDING LIMITING THE TRANSPORT OF YOUTH AND OTHER </p><p>CAMPAIGNERS TO THEIR OWN CONSTITUENCIES.  A NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTION, SUCH AS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WOULD BE AN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02379  01 OF 02  101014Z </p><p>EXCEPTION BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS ONE BIG CONSTITUENCY IN </p><p>THAT CASE. </p><p> </p><p>COURT CHALLENGES </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE SPEAKER RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE MDC\'S COURT </p><p>CHALLENGES TO LAST YEAR\'S ELECTORAL RESULTS.  WHILE THE </p><p>MDC CHALLENGED THE RESULTS IN 37 SEATS, ZANU-PF </p><p>CHALLENGED ONLY ONE.  THE RULING PARTY RECOGNIZES THAT </p><p>THE ELECTION IS OVER AND REPRESENTED THE VIEW OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE.  OF THE EIGHT MDC CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN </p><p>RULED UPON BY THE HIGH COURT, FOUR RESULTS HAVE BEEN </p><p>UPHELD AND FOUR NULLIFED.  ZANU-PF HAS APPEALED THE FOUR </p><p>NULLIFICATIONS, AND THOSE CASES ARE DUE TO BE HEARD BY </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT.  THE MDC IS CHALLENGING THE RESULTS </p><p>BASED ON TWO BASIC PREMISES: THERE WAS PRE-ELECTION </p><p>VIOLENCE AND THE VOTERS\' ROLL WAS DEFECTIVE.  THE LATTER </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE, MNANGAGWA AVERRED, BECAUSE THE </p><p>VOTERS WERE GIVEN WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION TO INSPECT </p><p>THE ROLLS.  IF THEY FOUND THEIR NAME WAS NOT ON THE ROLL </p><p>IN THEIR CONSTITUENCY, IT COULD BE ADDED TO A SEPARATE </p><p>REGISTER ON THE SPOT.  IF THEY FOUND THE NAME OF SOMEONE </p><p>WHO HAD DIED, IT COULD BE REMOVED IF IT WAS REPORTED TO </p><p>THE LOCAL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR.  ZIMBABWE\'S VOTING </p><p>RECORDS ARE FULLY COMPUTERIZED, BUT THE COMPUTER CANNOT </p><p>TELL IF SOMEONE HAS DIED OR MOVED UNLESS IT IS REPORTED, </p><p>HE EMPHASIZED.  IN ADDITION, THE DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR </p><p>COULD TAKE UP TO TWO MONTHS TO RECORD A CHANGE ONCE IT </p><p>IS REPORTED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02379  01 OF 02  101014Z </p><p>LAND ISSUE: NOT AS BAD AS IT SEEMS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MNANGAGWA THEN DELVED INTO THE HISTRIONICS OF </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE IN ZIMBABWE.  HE POINTED OUT THAT HE </p><p>HELPED DRAFT THE 1992 LAND ACQUISITION ACT, WHICH </p><p>OBLIGATED THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FARMERS FOR ACQUIRED </p><p>LAND WITHIN THREE MONTHS IN THE CURRENCY OF THE SELLER\'S </p><p>CHOICE.  THAT HAS ALL CHANGED, HOWEVER.  BY COMPULSORILY </p><p>ACQUIRING ALL THE COMMERCIAL FARMING LAND AT ONCE, </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS AVOIDING FIVE OR MORE YEARS OF STRIFE, THE </p><p>SPEAKER OPINED.  HE ADMITTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>ACQUIRED TOO MUCH LAND.  (NOTE: 95 PERCENT OF COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMING LAND HAS BEEN LISTED FOR SEIZURE.  END NOTE.) </p><p>FARMERS THAT ARE COOPERATIVE WITH GOVERNMENT CAN GET </p><p>THEIR LAND BACK.  THOSE FARMERS WITH MORE THAN ONE FARM </p><p>WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE THEY WANT TO KEEP; THE </p><p>REST WILL HAVE TO BE GIVEN UP UNLESS IT IS PART OF A </p><p>PRODUCING AGRIBUSINESS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6195 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02379  02 OF 02  101015Z </p><p>ACTION H-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    DS-00    TEDE-00  SS-00    DSCC-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /001W </p><p>                  ------------------107D83  101015Z /38 </p><p>R 101012Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9445 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002379 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/10/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: GRIGSBY STAFFDEL MEETS WITH ZIMBABWE </p><p>SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p>MONITORS OR OBSERVERS? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT ZIMBABWE ADMITTING ELECTION </p><p>MONITORS, MNANGAGWA DREW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN MONITORS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02379  02 OF 02  101015Z </p><p>AND OBSERVERS.  MONITORS, WHETHER THEY BE FROM THE EU, </p><p>SADC, OAU OR ELSEWHERE, ARE GIVEN TERMS OF REFERENCE AND </p><p>HAVE NO RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL OR ENTERING POLLING </p><p>PLACES.  THEY ARE ACCREDITED TO POINT OUT TO ELECTION </p><p>OFFICIALS PROBLEMS THEY SEE IN THE VOTING AND COUNTING </p><p>PROCESS.  MONITORS CAN, FOR EXAMPLE, ASK VOTE COUNTERS </p><p>TO RECOUNT A STACK OF BALLOTS IF THEY DO NOT APPEAR </p><p>CORRECTLY COUNTED, BUT THEY CANNOT DO THE COUNTING </p><p>THEMSELVES.  MONITORS ARE OBLIGATED TO REPORT OBSERVED </p><p>PROBLEMS TO GOVERNMENT.  OBSERVERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>ARE MORE RESTRICTED IN WHERE THEY CAN GO.  THEY CANNOT </p><p>POINT OUT PROBLEMS TO ELECTION OFFICIALS, BUT CAN ONLY </p><p>RECORD WHAT THEY SEE FOR THEIR OWN REPORTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ONLY AS THE MEETING WAS CONCLUDING DID MNANGAGWA </p><p>ASK ABOUT THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY </p><p>ACT (ZDERA) THAT HAD JUST PASSED THE SENATE.  THE </p><p>SPEAKER LAMENTED THAT THE BILL WOULD ONLY CAUSE GREATER </p><p>ECONOMIC HARDSHIP FOR ZIMBABWEANS.  STAFFDEL EXPLAINED </p><p>THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL AND THE STEPS IT WOULD GO </p><p>THROUGH IN CONGRESS NEXT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN HIS MEETING WITH THE STAFFDEL, SPEAKER </p><p>MNANGAGWA WAS CORDIAL AND PLEASANT, CONTINUING THE CHARM </p><p>OFFENSIVE HE BEGAN WITH OTHER WESTERN INTERLOCUTORS A </p><p>FEW MONTHS AGO.  MNANGAGWA, AS PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S HEIR </p><p>APPARENT, CLEARLY HAS AN EYE ON THE FUTURE BY TRYING TO </p><p>PORTRAY HIMSELF AS A MODERATE ON CONTENTIOUS ISSUES LIKE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02379  02 OF 02  101015Z </p><p>LAND, ELECTIONS, AND OBSERVERS.  HIS REPUTATION, </p><p>HOWEVER, WOULD PUT HIM IN THE HARD-LINE GOVERNMENT CAMP, </p><p>AND HIS ACTIONS WILL HAVE TO SPEAK LOUDER THAN HIS WORDS </p><p>IN THE FUTURE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) THIS CABLE WAS NOT CLEARED BY STAFFDEL BEFORE </p><p>ITS DEPARTURE FROM HARARE. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
