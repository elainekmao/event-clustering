THIS RULING MAKES MORRIS A HONDURAN </p><p>CITIZEN AND, THEREFORE, NOT EXTRADITABLE UNDER THE </p><p>HONDURAN CONSTITUTION. THE SOLICITOR GENERAL HAS FILED </p><p>AN APPEAL WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE COURT. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON JANUARY 9, 2003 POST LEARNED FROM STAFF </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COURT IN SAN PEDRO SULA </p><p>THAT ON OCTOBER 24, 2002 THE JUDGE HAD RULED IN FAVOR </p><p>OF MORRIS ANNULLING THE CANCELLATION OF HIS HONDURAN </p><p>CITIZENSHIP.  THE RULING WAS BASED ON ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>ERRORS, SUCH AS: A) THE REQUEST FOR CANCELLATION OF </p><p>MORRIS\' CITIZENSHIP WAS FILED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL </p><p>AND NOT BY THE SOLICITOR GENERAL; B) THE 1994 CRIMINAL </p><p>CASE AGAINST HIM WAS FILED AFTER HE HAD OBTAINED HIS </p><p>HONDURAN CITIZENSHIP; C) THE 1992 CRIME WAS CLOSED </p><p>BEFORE MORRIS OBTAINED HIS HONDURAN CITIZENSHIP (HE </p><p>SERVED 6 MONTHS PROBATION AND PAID A $250 DOLLAR </p><p>FINE). THE SOLICITOR GENERAL FILED AN APPEAL ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 19, 2002 WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE COURT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) WHILE TRYING TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE ABOVE- </p><p>MENTIONED APPEAL, WE ALSO LEARNED THAT ON MARCH 25, </p><p>2002 MORRIS HAD FILED ANOTHER APPEAL TO THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT ARGUING THAT THE REQUEST FOR CANCELLATION OF HIS </p><p>HONDURAN CITIZENSHIP SHOULD HAVE BEEN FILED BY THE </p><p>SOLICITOR GENERAL INSTEAD OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

(SBU) DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT POST HAS </p><p>BEEN MEETING WITH THE MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT, MINISTRY </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT\'S SECRETARY GENERAL, THE SUPREME COURT, </p><p>AND HAS MADE ENDLESS PHONE CALLS TO THE DIFFERENT </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS ON A WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS IN </p><p>ORDER TO OBTAIN AND KEEP TRACK OF INFORMATION ON THIS </p><p>CASE.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE GOH DOES NOT PROVIDE TIMELY </p><p>INFORMATION ON COURT CASES, AND THE HONDURAN JUDICIAL </p><p>SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE A CENTRALIZED TRACKING SYSTEM. </p><p>POST IS FORCED TO RELY ON INFORMATION PROVIDED BY </p><p>COURT STAFF THROUGH PERIODIC PHONE CALLS, SOMETIMES </p><p>THE CLERKS CLAIM THAT THERE ARE NO NEW DEVELOPMENTS ON </p><p>THE CASE WHEN IN FACT THERE IS OR THEY PROVIDED </p><p>INFORMATION WHICH IS NOT ACCURATE.  THE BACKDROP TO </p><p>THIS CASE IS PERSISTENT RUMORS THAT MORRIS, WHO HAS </p><p>MARRIED INTO A POLITICALLY WELL-CONNECTED HONDURAN </p><p>FAMILY, HAS CONTINUED TO PAY LARGE BRIBES TO JUDGES </p><p>AND COURT CLERKS TO DELAY AND POSTPONE RULINGS ON HIS </p><p>CASE. </p><p> </p><p>5.
