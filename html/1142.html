<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 003013 </p><p> </p><p>NICOSIA FOR ILMG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 6/13/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, SY </p><p>SUBJECT: ASAD LAID TO REST, BASHAR ERA BEGINNING, </p><p>         SYRIANS ADJUST TO NEW REALITY </p><p> </p><p>REF: DAMASCUS DAO IIR 6 891 0161 00 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RYAN C. CROCKER, REASON 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  IN THE PAST THREE DAYS, AS MANY SYRIANS </p><p>SAT NUMBLY ABSORBING THE NEWS THAT THEIR PRESIDENT, </p><p>LEADER, AND FATHER FIGURE OF THREE DECADES HAD DIED, SON </p><p>BASHAR AL-ASAD HAS QUIETLY AND SO FAR EFFECTIVELY </p><p>ASSUMED CHARGE; HE AWAITS ONLY OFFICIAL PARTY AND </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL BLESSING.  WE BELIEVE THIS WILL COME </p><p>QUICKLY AND WITHOUT DISRUPTION.  THE PARTY CONGRESS THAT </p><p>WILL PROMOTE BASHAR TO PARTY HEAD WILL BEGIN JUNE 17, </p><p>ALTHOUGH NOT WITH UNANIMOUS ENTHUSIASM.  IN A CAREFULLY </p><p>CHOREOGRAPHED FUNERAL DISPLAY, SENIOR SYRIAN OFFICIALS, </p><p>WITH DEFMIN MUSTAFA TALAS IN THE LEAD, LENT THEIR FULL </p><p>SUPPORT AT OFFICIAL CEREMONIES JUNE 13 IN DAMASCUS.  THE </p><p>ERA OF HAFIZ AL-ASAD, WHO, ON JUNE 10, DIED EXACTLY 33 </p><p>YEARS LATER TO THE DAY THAT ISRAEL FIRST REOCCUPIED THE </p><p>GOLAN, IS OVER..  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SYRIANS GATHER IN SHOCK--AND SORROW </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  MINISTER OF HEALTH DR. MUHAMMAD AL-SHATTI, </p><p>ESCORT TO THE U.S. DELEGATION, TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT </p><p>THE NATION WAS STILL "IN A STATE OF SHOCK."  BEFORE 6 </p><p>A.M. THE MORNING OF ASAD\'S FUNERAL JUNE 13, SYRIANS FROM </p><p>ALL CORNERS HAD BEGUN TO GATHER IN THE CENTRAL AREA </p><p>WHERE HIS CASKET WOULD BE CARRIED IN WALKING PROCESSION. </p><p>WHILE REPUBLICAN GUARD AND POLICE SECURITY WAS THICK </p><p>ALONG THE FUNERAL ROUTE AND THE AIRPORT ROAD, THE MANY </p><p>THOUSANDS OF EMOTIONAL MOURNERS MADE THEIR MARCH AND </p><p>DEPARTED WITHOUT INCIDENT.  THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR </p><p>CONTACTS HAVE FOR DECADES FELT NO PROBLEM EXPRESSING </p><p>THEIR FRUSTRATION, RESENTMENT, OR OPPOSITION TO THIS </p><p>REGIME DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>ASAD\'S PASSING IS STILL BEING ABSORBED, AND FOR SOME, </p><p>THE FEELING OF LOSS IS STRONG.  THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT IS </p><p>HEIGHTENED BY UNCERTAINTY AND APPREHENSION ABOUT THE </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>AT THE PALACE: BASHAR IN CHARGE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) NEWLY-MINTED GENERAL BASHAR AL-ASAD ACTED NOT </p><p>ONLY AS A BEREAVED SON, BUT ALSO AS THE LEADER OF SYRIA </p><p>AND THE PARAMOUNT HOST TO A STREAM OF FOREIGN </p><p>DIGNITARIES ARRIVING TO PAY THEIR CONDOLENCES AND </p><p>RESPECTS TO HIS FATHER THE MORNING OF JUNE 13.  THE </p><p>MASSIVE, GLASS-WALLED PALACE THAT SITS ON THE HILLS </p><p>OVERLOOKING DAMASCUS WAS FILLED WITH A RESPECTFUL BUZZ </p><p>AS LARGE DELEGATIONS WERE LED, IN EFFICIENT PROCESSION, </p><p>TO STAND BEFORE ASAD\'S CASKET.  DELEGATES THEN PROCEEDED </p><p>TO BRIEF MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN MINISTER FAROUK AL-SHARA, </p><p>AND THEN GREETED COMMANDER IN CHIEF BASHAR AL-ASAD, WHO </p><p>STOOD ALONE (NOTABLY WITHOUT HIS BROTHERS OR UNCLES) IN </p><p>A LARGE RECEIVING ROOM TO THE SIDE.  THE MESSAGE WAS </p><p>CLEAR THAT THIS WAS NOT A FAMILY GATHERING; GENERAL </p><p>BASHAR WAS THERE AS CHIEF OF STATE.  HE APPEARED CALM, </p><p>POISED, AND AUTHORITATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PROMINENT AMONG SENIOR SYRIANS WHO LINED THE </p><p>FORMAL RECEIVING ROOM WAS DEFMIN TALAS, LENDING SUPPORT </p><p>TO SEVERAL REPORTS THAT SINCE ASAD\'S DEATH TALAS HAD </p><p>ASSUMED THE ROLE AS NUMBER ONE ADVISER TO BASHAR.  FM </p><p>SHARA ACTED AS CO-HOST, SHUTTLING BETWEEN HIS DUTIES ON </p><p>THE SYRIAN DELEGATION AND RECEIVING AND BIDDING GOODBYE </p><p>TO VISITING DIGNITARIES.  THE LEBANESE LEADERSHIP AND </p><p>OTHER LEBANESE WERE IN STRONG EVIDENCE AND SAT OPPOSITE </p><p>THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN THE RECEIVING HALL. </p><p> </p><p>NO ONE OPPOSING, BUT NOT EVERYONE </p><p>HASTENING TOWARD THE FUTURE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE FUNERAL CEREMONIES WENT SMOOTHLY, INDICATING </p><p>THAT THE SYRIA\'S CURRENT LEADERSHIP AND BA\'TH PARTY </p><p>MACHINERY WAS ABLE TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY IN A CRISIS </p><p>SITUATION.  THE BA\'TH PARTY CONGRESS WILL BEGIN AS </p><p>PLANNED JUNE 17, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL PARTY MEMBERS ARE </p><p>RUSHING TO EMBRACE THE NEW ERA.  MINISTER OF HEALTH AL- </p><p>SHATTI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT IT WAS BASHAR WHO HAD </p><p>INSISTED THAT THE BA\'TH PARTY CONGRESS GO AHEAD AS </p><p>PLANNED, AN IMPORTANT STEP ON MOVING THE COUNTRY FROM </p><p>MOURNING THE PAST TO BUILDING THE FUTURE.  HE REMARKED </p><p>THAT, LEFT TO ITS OWN DEVICES, THE OSSIFIED PARTY </p><p>LEADERSHIP PROBABLY WOULD WAIT ANOTHER SIX MONTHS, AND </p><p>SAID THAT WHILE "NO ONE WAS OPPOSED, NOT EVERYONE WAS </p><p>HASTENING TOWARDS IT."   ON THE MUCH-DISCUSSED ISSUE OF </p><p>ASAD\'S RIVAL AND BROTHER RIF\'AT, BOTH THE RUSSIAN AND </p><p>EGYPTIAN AMBASSADORS DISCOUNTED THIS THREAT DESPITE THE </p><p>RIF\'AT STATEMENT IN SPAIN CHALLENGING HIS NEPHEW. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT.  THE SYRIAN SUCCESSION IS PROCEEDING AS </p><p>SMOOTHLY AND CALMLY AS POSSIBLE.  BASHAR PRESIDED AS </p><p>LEADER OF SYRIA DURING THE FUNERAL PROCEEDINGS; SENIOR </p><p>SYRIANS WERE THERE TO LEND HIM SUPPORT.  DESPITE THE </p><p>PROMINENT PRESS PLAY, FEW OF OUR CONTACTS TAKE THE </p><p>RIF\'AT CHALLENGE SERIOUSLY.  THE ERA OF HAFIZ AL-ASAD </p><p>HAS OFFICIALLY PASSED AND THE BASHAR ERA HAS BEGUN.  THE </p><p>SON APPEARS WELL ON HIS WAY TO GAINING POWER IN AN </p><p>ORDERLY FASHION.  THE QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER HE CAN </p><p>KEEP IT. UNLIKE JORDANIAN KING ABDULLAH, WHO ASSUMED THE </p><p>THRONE BOLSTERED BY INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT AND </p><p>LEGITIMACY, BASHAR\'S QUEST FOR LEGITIMACY WILL HINGE </p><p>MORE ON SYRIA\'S COMPLEX INTERNAL SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>CROCKER </p><p></p></div>
