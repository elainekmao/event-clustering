An editorial and an op-ed article carried in the July </p><p>      13 edition of the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" </p><p>      concentrate on the talks between President George W. Bush </p><p>      and his South African counterpart, Thabo Mbeki, during </p><p>      President Bush\'s visit to Africa.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Time to set road map in motion" the </p><p>      paper comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "U. S. President George W. Bush left Africa last </p><p>      week after making significantly progressive </p><p>      statements on the resolution of Zimbabwe\'s political </p><p>      stalemate.  His endorsement of the African </p><p>      initiative on Zimbabwe was the final confirmation to </p><p>      all those who expected and actually agitated for a </p><p>      more muscular approach to the country\'s protracted </p><p>      impasse that only Africans and Zimbabweans in </p><p>      particular were better placed to sort out the </p><p>      country\'s challenges. . .The country must now put </p><p>      into motion its road map for a transition out of the </p><p>      current impasse without getting obfuscated by </p><p>      academic and irrelevant demands that do not serve </p><p>      the interests of the nations. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Zimbabwe: The messages from the </p><p>      Mbeki/Bush meeting" the same newspaper carried the </p><p>      following op-ed under its ghost column "The </p><p>      Scrutator" on page 10: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .But, was there a `climb-down\' on the part of </p><p>      the U. S. A., as claimed in some official circles </p><p>      here in Zimbabwe?  No.  There could have been no </p><p>      `climb-down\' if there had been no `climb-up\' in the </p><p>      first instance.  For, the position of both the </p><p>      U. S. A. and Britain on the question of Zimbabwe had </p><p>      been stated quite clearly by the American Assistant </p><p>      Secretary of State, William Kansteiner. . .following </p><p>      the visit to Harare on 5 May, 2003, by the three </p><p>      African Presidents, Mbeki, Obasanjo and Muluzi. </p><p>      Both expressed confidence in this "African </p><p>      initiative. . .\'  So, if there had been a </p><p>      `climb-down,\' it was in May, 2003, after which the </p><p>      burden was firmly on Mbeki\'s shoulders.  That Bush </p><p>      would so unequivocally re-affirm that. . .is only a </p><p>      pyrric (sic) victory for those in Zimbabwe who are </p><p>      gloating over what they perceive as another defeat </p><p>      for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change (MDC); </p><p>      in reality, it is a major challenge for Mbeki in </p><p>      particular and a loud warning for Harare. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
