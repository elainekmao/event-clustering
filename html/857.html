<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 012278 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p>PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR S/NIS (PRESEL) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:11/15/17 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KISL, PTER, PHUM, PINR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GLIMPSES OF THE SHARIA IN TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 11676;B) ANKARA 11279 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR RICHARD MCKEE, </p><p>EMBASSY ANKARA.  REASON: 1.5(B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ALONG WITH THE GROWING ELECTORAL STRENGTH OF </p><p>PRIME MINISTER NECMETTIN ERBAKAN\'S ISLAMIST REFAH </p><p>(WELFARE) PARTY, THE IDEA OF RESTORING THE SHARIA </p><p>(RELIGIOUS LAW) APPEARS TO BE GAINING ADHERENTS IN </p><p>TURKEY (REF A).  THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS FROM </p><p>ISLAMIST SOURCES IN REFAH AND THE GOT\'S RELIGIOUS </p><p>AFFAIRS DIRECTORATE PROVIDE A GLIMPSE OF WHERE THE </p><p>DEBATE ON RELIGION, POLITICS, AND SOCIETY IN THIS </p><p>COUNTRY MAY BE HEADED. IN THIS, TURKEY\'S LARGELY </p><p>DEVOUT KURDISH MINORITY LIKELY WILL PLAY A PIVOTAL </p><p>ROLE.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>THE KURDS: "LOYAL TO THE SHARIA..." </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  IN A MEETING WITH POLOFF ON OCTOBER 31, MEHMET </p><p>FUAT FIRAT, A KURDISH REFAH DEPUTY REPRESENTING </p><p>ISTANBUL, COMMENTED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION TO </p><p>HIS ETHNIC BRETHREN. FIRAT NOTED THAT HE WAS A MEMBER </p><p>OF THE REFAH CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION BOARD (NOMINALLY </p><p>THE PARTY\'S HIGHEST POLICYMAKING BODY) WITH POLITICAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR HAKKARI, SIIRT, AND OTHER PROVINCES </p><p>IN PREDOMINANTLY KURDISH SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY, HIS </p><p>NATIVE REGION.  (NOTE:  FIRAT\'S AUTHORITY ON KURDISH </p><p>AND ISLAMIC ISSUES ALSO IS ROOTED IN HIS OWN </p><p>ILLUSTRIOUS PEDIGREE.  HE IS A GRANDSON OF SHAYKH SAID </p><p>OF PALU, WHO LED THE FIRST MAJOR ISLAMIST-KURDISH </p><p>REBELLION AGAINST THE FELDGLING SECULAR TURKISH </p><p>REPUBLIC IN 1925. SHAYKH SAID HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF </p><p>A CULT HERO, PARTICULARLY AMONG ISLAM-ORIENTED KURDISH </p><p>NATIONALISTS IN TURKEY. END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE KURDS, FIRAT ASSERTED, WERE "LOYAL TO THE </p><p>SHARIA."  THIS WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE TEACHINGS </p><p>OF THE NAKSHIBENDI TARIKAT (TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL </p><p>ISLAMIC BROTHERHOOD), TO WHICH FIRAT HAS FAMILY TIES. </p><p>MOST NAKSHIBENDI MURIDS (ADHERENTS) IN TURKEY WERE </p><p>KURDS, HE NOTED.  FIRAT OBSERVED THAT NAKSHIBENDI </p><p>KURDS WERE NOT FANATICS, HOWEVER; AS EVIDENCE, HE </p><p>CONTRASTED THE RELATIVELY AUSTERE, RESTRAINED </p><p>NAKSHIBENDI RITUALS WITH THOSE OF THE MORE ECSTATIC </p><p>KADIRI TARIKAT. IN FIRAT\'S VIEW, THE KURDS OF TURKEY </p><p>SIMPLY WANTED THE KIND OF JUSTICE THAT OBTAINED IN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES -- INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO USE THEIR OWN </p><p>LANGUAGE AND DEVELOP THEIR OWN CULTURE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>FIRAT, THESE FREEDOMS WOULD BE PERMITTED UNDER THE </p><p>SHARIA. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) FIRAT EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE ATTITUDE </p><p>OF MANY NAKSHIBENDI SHAYKHS, WHOM HE ACCUSED OF </p><p>PURSUING THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND ALLIANCES WITH "THE </p><p>STATE" AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR MURIDS.  "ALL THEY WANT </p><p>TO DO IS GET RICH," HE LAMENTED.  WITH EVIDENT PRIDE, </p><p>FIRAT STATED THAT IN CONTRAST, SHAYKH SAID HAD USED HIS </p><p>WEALTH TO RAISE AN ARMY; "HE SPENT HIS MONEY ON </p><p>SOLDIERS." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) FIRAT RELATED HOW AS A YOUNG MAN HE HAD MET </p><p>SAID NURSI (AKA SAID KURDI), THE ISLAMIC SCHOLAR WHOSE </p><p>WRITINGS BECAME THE BASIS FOR THE MYSTICAL NURCU </p><p>MOVEMENT.  ACCORDING TO FIRAT, NURSI WAS IMPRISONED </p><p>FOR HIS ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF ISLAM AND KURDISH </p><p>CULTURAL AUTONOMY BY MUSTAFA KEMAL ATATURK.  BEFORE </p><p>HIS DEATH IN 1960, NURSI VOWED TO A GROUP OF KURDISH </p><p>NOTABLES INCLUDING FIRAT THAT THE KURDS WOULD "GET </p><p>THEIR REVENGE AGAINST THE KEMALISTS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>...BUT WHAT IS IT? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) REFAH DEPUTY FROM BITLIS ABDULHALUK MUTLU, LIKE </p><p>FIRAT ANOTHER NAKSHIBENDI KURD, OBSERVED TO POLOFF AND </p><p>VISITING INR OFFICERS ON NOVEMBER 14 THAT THE KURDS </p><p>WERE "BOUND" BY THE PRINCIPLES OF ISLAM.  HE LAUGHED </p><p>AS HE RELATED HOW HIS NEPHEW, A STUDENT IN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES, WAS FOND OF TELLING PEOPLE THAT THE U.S. WAS </p><p>THE MOST "ISLAMIC" STATE IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE IT </p><p>EMBODIED THE SHARIA\'S PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE TO A </p><p>HIGHER DECREE THAN ANY OTHER REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IN THE KURDISH MIND, THE SHARIA NOW WAS </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH FREEDOM AND "DEMOCRACY," MUTLU SAID. </p><p>LIKE "DEMOCRACY," HOWEVER, "NO ONE WAS SURE WHAT IT </p><p>(SHARIA) MEANS."  MUTLU ARGUED THAT DESPITE THE </p><p>TRAPPINGS OF DEMOCRACY IN TURKEY, HE, LIKE THE REST OF </p><p>TURKEY\'S KURDS, HAD NEVER LIVED UNDER A TRULY </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REGIME; THUS, HE HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE </p><p>KNEW LITTLE ABOUT HOW A REAL DEMOCRACY WORKED. </p><p>ILLUSTRATING HIS POINT, MUTLU PREDICTED THAT REFAH </p><p>WOULD NOT TRY TO RESTORE RELIGIOUS RULE IN TURKEY. </p><p>INSTEAD, IF REFAH EVENTUALLY WON A PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>MAJORITY, IT WOULD THEN "ASK THE NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL FOR ITS RECOMMENDATIONS" ON THE SUBJECT, HE </p><p>LAUGHED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TURKEY AND THE TALEBAN </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) LATER ON NOVEMBER 14, POLOFF AND INR OFFICERS </p><p>CALLED ON NIYAZI KAHVECI, THE HEAD OF THE RESEARCH </p><p>DEPARTMENT AT THE GOT\'S RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS DIRECTORATE </p><p>(THE "DIYANET," AS IT IS KNOWN IN TURKISH).  AN </p><p>ISLAMIC SCHOLAR, KAHVECI ASSERTED THAT LITTLE HAD </p><p>CHANGED IN ISLAMIC DOCTRINE SINCE THE MIDDLE AGES. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, SUNNI ISLAM IN TURKEY AND AS PRACTICED </p><p>BY THE TALEBAN IN AFGHANISTAN WAS BASICALLY THE SAME. </p><p>MUSLIMS BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE BOUND BY THE WORD OF </p><p>THE QURAN.  ALTHOUGH KAHVECI AND A FEW COLLEAGUES IN </p><p>ACADEMIA WERE TRYING TO "REFORM" ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES TO </p><p>FIT THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC WORLD, MOST TURKISH SCHOLARS </p><p>HAD LEARNED THEIR TRADE IN "ALGERIA AND EGYPT" (READ: </p><p>WHERE RADICAL "FUNDAMENTALIST" OR TRADITIONAL VIEWS OF </p><p>THE SHARIA PREVAIL).  THEOLOGY PROFESSORS IN TURKEY\'S </p><p>UNIVERSITIES GENERALLY SUPPORTED REFAH, KAHVECI ADDED, </p><p>AS DID THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE STAFF AT THE </p><p>DIYANET. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) KAHVECI NOTED THAT REFAH HAD BEEN VERY CLEVER </p><p>IN GETTING ITS MESSAGE ACROSS TO THE PUBLIC AND IN </p><p>FACT HAD POSITIONED ITSELF AS THE PRIMARY SPOKESMAN </p><p>FOR RELIGIOUS TURKS.  IN KAHVECI\'S VIEW, THE SECULAR </p><p>PARTIES PLAYED INTO REFAH\'S HANDS BY GANGING UP ON THE </p><p>ISLAMISTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, POLITICALLY-ORIENTED TV </p><p>DEBATES ROUTINELY DEVOLVED INTO A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN </p><p>REFAH ON ONE SIDE AND EVERYONE ELSE ON THE OTHER. </p><p>THIS LEGITIMIZED REFAH\'S RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS IN THE </p><p>MINDS OF THE TV VIEWING AUDIENCE.  MOREOVER, THE </p><p>SECULAR PARTIES HAD LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THIS. </p><p>"WHY NOT?" KAHVECI SAID. "THEY DON\'T KNOW ANYTHING </p><p>ABOUT ISLAM." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT: DEFINING SHARIA -- AND WINNING VOTES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) "\'IJMA" -- CONSENSUS -- TRADITIONALLY WAS ONE </p><p>OF THE CARDINAL SOURCES OF ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE ALONG </p><p>WITH THE QURAN, THE SUNNA AND HADITH (TRADITIONS AND </p><p>SAYINGS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD), AND QIYAS </p><p>(ANALOGICAL REASONING). TODAY, \'IJMA IS THE FOCUS OF </p><p>SOME SCHOLARLY ATTEMPTS TO DISCERN COMMON POINTS </p><p>BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC AND ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  IN CLASSICAL JURISPRUDENCE, HOWEVER, \'IJMA </p><p>MEANT CONSENSUS OF THE LEARNED; THE OPINIONS OF THOSE </p><p>NOT SCHOOLED IN THE FINE POINTS OF ISLAMIC DOCTRINE </p><p>CARRIED NO WEIGHT. IN KEEPING WITH THIS TRDITIONAL </p><p>ATTITUDE, TURKEY\'S MUSLIMS HAVE BEEN MORE THAN WILLING </p><p>LET THE SCHOLARS INTERPRET THE SHARIA AND ENLIGHTEN </p><p>THE FAITHFUL. IN POLITICAL TERMS, NOW THAT AN ISLAMIST </p><p>ALTERNATIVE TO THE SECULAR REGIME IS AVAILABLE IN THE </p><p>FORM OF REFAH, MANY RELIGIOUS "CONSERVATIVE" VOTERS </p><p>WHO BY DINT OF HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCE HAD SUPPORTED </p><p>SECULAR PARTIES ARE RIPE FOR THE PICKING BY REFAH </p><p>PRIME MINISTER ERBAKAN -- THE "HOCA" (TEACHER) AS HE </p><p>IS KNOWN AMONG HIS FOLLOWERS. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) FOR KAHVECI, THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE </p><p>"MEDIEVAL" REFAH UNDERSTANDING OF THE SHARIA LARGELY </p><p>HAS BEEN PROTECTED FROM SCHOLARLY EXAMINATION AND </p><p>COMPETITION BY THE KEMALISTS\' HOSTILITY TO ISLAMIC </p><p>POLITICAL INFLUENCE, WHICH HAS HAMPERED FREE, INFORMED </p><p>DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT.  WITH NO POLITICAL ALTERNATIVE </p><p>OF THEIR OWN, TURKEY\'S RELIGIOUS KURDS HAVE BEGUN TO </p><p>FLOCK TO REFAH, HELPING TO TURN ERBAKAN\'S PARTY INTO </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S LARGEST.  KAHVECI\'S FEAR IS THAT MUCH OF </p><p>THE REST OF TURKEY WILL FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) OUR SENSE IS THAT SUPPORT FOR RESTORING THE </p><p>SHARIA IS STILL CONFINED TO A MINORITY -- ALBEIT A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING ONE (SEE REF A FOR SOME RECENT </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION POLLING ON ATTITUDES TOWARD ISLAMISM </p><p>AND THE SHARIA).  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE DIVIDING LINES </p><p>BETWEEN AVOWEDLY SECULAR (EVEN IF, IN RARE CASES, </p><p>PERSONALLY OBSERVANT) AND SELF-CONSCIOUSLY </p><p>RELIGIOUS/ISLAMIST CITIZENS ARE BECOMING MORE </p><p>PRONOUNCED.  VIOLENT INCIDENTS, PARTICULARLY ON </p><p>UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES, COULD WELL ENSUE. </p><p> </p><p>GROSSMAN </p><p></p></div>
