SUMMARY:  THE WAR IN IRAQ, IRAQI CIVILIAN CAUSALITIES, AND </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AID DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA.  UAE PRINT </p><p>DAILIES ALSO COVERED ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS IN DUBAI, VARIOUS </p><p>ARAB CAPITALS, AND AROUND THE WORLD.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" ARTICLE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR ARABS TO REALIZE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE </p><p>WAR IN IRAQ.  ANOTHER "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL DESCRIBED THE WAR IN </p><p>IRAQ AS THE NEW "MONGOL MASSACRES."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON THE UN\'S ROLE IN MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRESSURE TO STOP THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS CREATED BY THE WAR, ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED 3/29: </p><p> </p><p>"...AT THIS TIME, AN ESSENTIAL QUESTION ARISES:  WHY DID ALL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS AND ATTEMPTS TO STOP THIS WAR CEASE?  WHERE </p><p>IS THE UN, THE CHARTER OF WHICH CALLS FOR ENSURING WORLD PEACE? </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY STILL HAS A ROLE WHICH SHOULD BE </p><p>PERFORMED AND ACTIVATED." </p><p> </p><p>3.  ALLEGING THE REAL REASONS BEHIND THE WAR ON IRAQ ARE OIL AND </p><p>PROTECTING ISRAEL, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 3/29: </p><p> </p><p>"AMERICAN AND BRITISH OFFICIALS CLAIM TO HAVE ACHIEVED TWO </p><p>POSITIVE OUTCOMES:  SECURING THE OIL FIELDS IN THE SOUTH AND </p><p>SECURING THE WESTERN FRONT TO PREVENT THE TARGETING OF ISRAEL </p><p>WITH MISSILES ... THE REAL REASONS BEHIND THIS WAR ARE BOTH THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF ISRAEL AND IRAQ\'S OIL WEALTH AND NOTHING ELSE." </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENTING ON THE RESIGNATION OF RICHARD PERLE, UAE COLUMNIST </p><p>AYSHA SULTAN WROTE IN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" ON </p><p>3/29: </p><p> </p><p>"... CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE ALLIES SEEM TO BE LOOMING.  THE FIRST </p><p>TO FALL OUT ... WAS THE PRIME MINISTER OF SPAIN, JOSE MARIA </p><p>AZNAR, WHO IS WIDELY HATED BY THE SPANISH PEOPLE AND RIDICULED BY </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  AZNAR AND PERLE ARE NOT THE FIRST VICTIMS AND ARE </p><p>NOT THE FIRST NAILS IN THIS EMPIRE\'S COFFIN." </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "FACING THE TRUTH," UAE COLUMNIST DR. </p><p>MOHAMED IDREES WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" ON 3/29: </p><p> </p><p>"... THEY ARE GOING TO DESTROY IRAQ WHILE HAVING THEIR EYES ON </p><p>PALESTINE AND OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.  COLIN POWELL STATED THIS </p><p>WHEN HE SAID THAT THE U.S. IS COMING INTO IRAQ IN ORDER TO FORCE </p><p>SOME CHANGES IN THE REGION TO SERVE AMERICAN INTERESTS AND HE DID </p><p>NOT FORGET TO MENTION ISRAEL\'S \'PEACE\' AS A PRIORITY.  THE LOSS </p><p>OF IRAQ IS JUST THE BEGINNING AND NOT THE END.  AND WITHOUT AN </p><p>ARAB ROLE THAT COULD SAY \'NO\' TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN IRAQ, THE </p><p>ARABS WILL NEVER REALIZE WHERE AND WHEN IS THE END, SINCE THEY </p><p>ALREADY LOST THE BEGINNING." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON RECENT STATEMENTS ABOUT ISRAEL AND THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS BY UK FOREIGN MINISTER JACK STRAW, ABU DHABI-BASED </p><p>SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 3/27: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE STATEMENT ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH, IT HAS TO BE ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY ACTIONS IN ORDER TO RESTORE DIGNITY TO THE VICTIM AND TO </p><p>PUNISH THE TORMENTOR ... THE WESTERN COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE </p><p>REPEATEDLY WISHED TO SOLVE THE PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI CONFLICT </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE ROADMAP PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH, OF </p><p>TWO STATES LIVING TOGETHER IN PEACE, ARE REQUIRED TO MOVE AHEAD </p><p>AND FORCE ISRAEL TO ACCEPT THE FAIT ACCOMPLI WILLINGLY OR </p><p>UNWILLINGLY.  ONLY THEN WILL A HALF CENTURY OF INJUSTICE IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST BE RECOGNIZED." </p><p> </p><p>7.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "THE NEW MONGOL MASSACRES," "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 3/27: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHOEVER IS ADDICTED TO COVERING UP FOR THE CRIMINALS WHO </p><p>COMMIT THE MASSACRES AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS, WILL DEFINITELY </p><p>COMMIT THE SAME.  WHOEVER WANTS HIS COMPANIES TO BENEFIT WILL </p><p>RESORT TO DESTRUCTION IN ORDER TO AN CREATE APPROPRIATE </p><p>FOUNDATION FOR RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS ... THE NEW MONGOL </p><p>NIGHTMARE HAS SPREAD TO ALL ARAB COUNTRIES AND EVERYONE IS MERELY </p><p>AN ONLOOKER.  THESE NEW MONGOLS WILL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH IRAQ </p><p>ONCE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SWALLOW IT." </p><p> </p><p>8.  UNDER THE OP-ED HEADLINE, "A BARGAIN OVER A NATION," </p><p>INFLUENTIAL UAE BUSINESSMAN KHALAF AL HABTOOR WROTE IN EXPATRIATE- </p><p>ORIENTED ENGLISH DAILY GULF NEWS ON 3/29: </p><p> </p><p>"NOBODY CAN CLAIM THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH WHAT\'S HAPPENING IN </p><p>THE ARAB WORLD.  THIS IS FATE CREEPING AT US VERY QUICKLY AND WE </p><p>CAN\'T STOP IT.  IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE TO ASK THIS QUESTION ... </p><p>ESPECIALLY SINCE SOME GOVERNMENTS ARE REJECTING THE PROBLEMS OF </p><p>THEIR PEOPLE.  EXCEPT THE EMIRATES EXPERIMENT ... THERE IS NO </p><p>EVIDENCE IN OUR ARAB WORLD THAT WE HAVE LEADERS WHO GIVE PRIORITY </p><p>TO THEIR NATIONS OVER THEMSELVES ... AND SOME ARAB LEADERS ACT </p><p>LIKE THAT BEDOUIN WHO COVERED HIS HEAD AND SAID:  NOTHING MATTERS </p><p>AS FAR AS I AND MY CAMEL ARE SAFE!" </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
