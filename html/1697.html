VATICAN SPOKESMAN, JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S HEALTH PROBLEMS CAUSED SOME CONCERN </p><p>DURING HIS VISIT TO GREECE, SYRIA AND MALTA. CONFIRMING THE </p><p>POPE WAS "EXHAUSTED," NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THE PONTIFF\'S </p><p>NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION AND HIS AGE TELLS THE WORLD THAT </p><p>"THIS BLESSED FATIGUE IS WORTH IT." HE SPECULATED THAT </p><p>FUTURE POPES WOULD RECALL THE EXAMPLE OF JOHN PAUL II AND </p><p>"THE IMPLICIT MESSAGE THAT, DESPITE THE PAIN AND FATIGUE HE </p><p>SUFFERED, THEY WILL SEE HOW MUCH GOD ALLOWED HIM TO </p><p>ACCOMPLISH." EMBASSY CONTACTS ACCOMPANYING THE POPE ON HIS </p><p>TRIP SAID HE STRUGGLED MORE THAN USUAL BUT THAT HIS TENACITY </p><p>AND DRIVE REMAIN INTACT, JOKING AT TIMES WITH THE PRESS </p><p>POOL. THE VATICAN SPOKESMAN SAID THE POPE HAS NO PLANS TO </p><p>CURTAIL HIS TRAVEL SCHEDULE (UKRAINE IN JUNE, ARMENIA IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER, CANADA IN THE SUMMER OF 2002, PLUS TWO MORE </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT YEAR). NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THAT THE POPE "WILL </p><p>NOT STOP HIS TRAVELS UNTIL GOD CALLS HIM HOME." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>VATICAN DECLARES LATEST PAPAL VISITS A RESOUNDING SUCCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02600  01 OF 02  122002Z </p><p>3.   VATICAN SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS DECLARED THE </p><p>PAPAL VISIT TO GREECE, SYRIA AND MALTA AS MORE THAN </p><p>SATISFACTORY. PARTICULARLY PLEASING FOR THE VATICAN WAS THE </p><p>POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM THE GREEK ORTHODOX ARCHBISHOP OF </p><p>ATHENS TO THE PONTIFF\'S VISIT TO GREECE. ARCHBISHOP </p><p>CHRISTODOULOS GAVE THE POPE A COURTEOUS WELCOME, THANKED HIM </p><p>FOR HIS VISIT AND PROMISED HIS PRAYERS IN SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>REMAINDER OF THE PAPAL TRIP. NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THE POPE DID </p><p>NOT EXPECT THE GESTURE AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO "PROVIDENCE." </p><p>THE SPOKESMAN CONTINUED THAT POPE JOHN PAUL WAS DELIGHTED </p><p>WITH HIS TRIP TO GREECE AND THAT "TWO MONTHS AGO, THIS TRIP </p><p>WAS UNTHINKABLE." HE EFFUSED THAT "ONCE AGAIN THE POPE DOES </p><p>NOT LET HISTORY HAPPEN BUT HAS DIRECTED IT." WHEN ASKED </p><p>WHETHER THE EXPERIENCE IN GREECE AUGURED WELL FOR A LONGED- </p><p>FOR PAPAL TRIP TO MOSCOW, NAVARRO-VALLS ANSWERED, "WE\'LL </p><p>SPEAK ABOUT THAT IN TWO MONTHS." (COMMENT: THE VATICAN WILL </p><p>WANT TO WAIT FOR THE OUTCOME OF THE POPE\'S VISIT TO UKRAINE </p><p>IN JUNE BEFORE MAKING FURTHER COMMENTS ABOUT A VISIT TO </p><p>MOSCOW. END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>4.   NAVARRO-VALLS WAS CAREFUL TO DEPOLITICIZE THE SYRIAN </p><p>LEG OF THE POPE\'S PILGRIMAGE. NAVARRO-VALLS DISTANCED THE </p><p>VATICAN FROM PRESIDENT ASSAD\'S REMARKS AT THE WELCOME </p><p>CEREMONY. HE SAID THE POPE HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT </p><p>ASSAD WOULD SAY AND THAT THE VATICAN\'S RESPONSE WAS </p><p>CONTAINED IN THE PONTIFF\'S SPEECH "ENUNCIATING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRINCIPLES THAT APPLY TO ALL." COMMENTING ON THE PONTIFF\'S </p><p>VISIT TO QUNEITRA, HE SAID THE "SOLE OBJECTIVE AND THE SOLE </p><p>REASON WAS TO PRAY FOR PEACE." THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT </p><p>"PEOPLE OF GOODWILL WILL UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE" THE </p><p>POPE\'S GESTURE. NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THE POPE WAS MOVED BY THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02600  01 OF 02  122002Z </p><p>RESPECT AND AFFECTION SHOWN HIM BY SYRIAN MOSLEMS, ADDING </p><p>THAT JOHN PAUL II WAS AWARE OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FIRST </p><p>VISIT BY A POPE TO A MOSQUE. HE SAID POPE JOHN PAUL HOPED IT </p><p>WOULD BEAR NEW FRUIT IN THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE </p><p>CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>SWISS GUARD LOOKING FOR VOLUNTEERS ON THE INTERNET </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5.   THE SWISS GUARD SWORE IN 26 NEW RECRUITS IN A MAY 6 </p><p>CEREMONY, HOWEVER THE UNIT IS STILL SHORT SEVEN SOLDIERS. </p><p>SWISS GUARD COMMANDER, COLONEL PIUS SEGMULLER SAID THE </p><p>GUARDS HAVE BEGUN TO USE THE INTERNET (GARDESUISSE.ORG) </p><p>FOR RECRUITMENT. HE NOTED THAT SWITZERLAND\'S STRONG ECONOMY </p><p>AND SECULARIZATION MAKE IT HARDER TO ATTRACT RECRUITS. "WHEN </p><p>THINGS ARE GOING WELL IN OUR COUNTRY, YOUTH FIND WORK EASILY </p><p>AND ARE NOT INTERESTED IN COMING TO ROME TO SERVE THE POPE," </p><p>HE SAID. IN THE WAKE OF A 1998 MURDER-SUICIDE SCANDAL, THE </p><p>SELECTION PROCESS HAS BEEN TOUGHENED UP.
