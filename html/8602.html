<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003421 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DOC/BIS FOR RCUPITT </p><p>DHS FOR ABACHELLER </p><p>ROME FOR CUSTOMS ATTACHE </p><p>DOE FOR ASCHEINMAN AND DMARTIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PARM, AMGT, ETTC, KSTC, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: EXBS PROPOSED ACTIVITIES FOR JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 113776 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Post concurs with EXBS cooperative activities </p><p>proposed reftel, and expects the GOJ will react favorably to </p><p>the proposal. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Post recommends the following amendments to the </p><p>proposed programs: </p><p> </p><p>--  For FY 02 funds, we note that item (d), "Licensing </p><p>Workshop," is proposed as a one-time program.  We expect that </p><p>the workshop will be an excellent start to a training regimen </p><p>for GOJ officials slated to take on licensing </p><p>responsibilities, but we do not think it will be sufficient </p><p>to train them fully.  We recommend repeating the training </p><p>program every six months, using whatever FY funds are </p><p>appropriate, to ensure that GOJ staff are comprehensively and </p><p>continuously trained.  Similarly, item (k), "Computer Data </p><p>Analysis," should be offered on a regular basis to ensure </p><p>staff are regularly and properly trained. </p><p> </p><p>--  For FY 03 funds, we recommend similarly that training </p><p>under item (d), "X-Ray Van and Associated Training," be </p><p>offered on a regular basis instead of as a one-off.  In </p><p>addition, post has received requests from senior ASEZA </p><p>customs officials over the past months requesting immediate </p><p>additional training on existing x-ray equipment in Aqaba </p><p>port.  If possible, we recommend adding a regular training </p><p>program for existing x-ray equipment at the earliest possible </p><p>availability and regularly thereafter. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Post looks forward to working with the EXBS team </p><p>over the workplan period.  We note, however, that a program </p><p>of the ambitious scope proposed would place extraordinary </p><p>pressure on Post resources, both in ECON and GSO.  In order </p><p>to ensure that the program gets the appropriate level of </p><p>administrative support, we recommend Washington consider </p><p>identifying and contracting a long-term in-country EXBS </p><p>advisor or locally-hired logistics assistant who could </p><p>coordinate the various program activities from Amman.  Post </p><p>also would welcome coordination with USAID Jordan\'s customs </p><p>program, which has focused in part on enforcement and </p><p>intelligence issues with Jordanian customs. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
