<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOSCOW 004277 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/NIS AND EUR/RUS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  2/26/09 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, RS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SHARIA, SHURA, AND STATEHOOD IN CHECHNYA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  MOSCOW 2479 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY EDWARD J. SALAZAR, CHIEF, INTERNAL </p><p>POLITICAL AFFAIRS  REASONS:  1.5 (B) AND (D). ORDWAY. </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) CHECHEN PRESIDENT MASKHADOV DECLARED A STATE OF </p><p>SHARIA (ISLAMIC) LAW EARLY IN FEBRUARY, PROMPTING A </p><p>FLOOD OF HIGH-LEVEL CRITICISM IN MOSCOW.  RUSSIAN </p><p>POLITICIANS HAVE PREDICTED WORSENING RUSSIAN-CHECHEN </p><p>RELATIONS DUE TO THE SUSPENSION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW </p><p>IN THE BREAKAWAY REPUBLIC.  ACCORDING TO REGIONAL </p><p>EXPERTS, THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW AND A SHURA </p><p>(COUNCIL) IN CHECHNYA MAY BE NO MORE THAN A LAST DITCH </p><p>ATTEMPT BY MASKHADOV TO UNITE A SHARPLY-DIVIDED </p><p>POPULATION AND BUILD A SENSE OF STATEHOOD.  THE </p><p>PROGNOSIS, HOWEVER, REMAINS THE SAME:  IT IS UNLIKELY </p><p>THAT MASKHADOV OR THE OPPOSITION CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS </p><p>TASK.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE, IN WITH THE SHURA </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ON FEBRUARY 3, THE INTRODUCTION OF FULL-SCALE </p><p>SHARIA (ISLAMIC) LAW WAS ANNOUNCED IN CHECHNYA ON THE </p><p>INITIATIVE OF CHECHEN PRESIDENT ASLAN MASKHADOV.  TO </p><p>BEGIN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA LAW, MASKHADOV </p><p>SIGNED SEVERAL DECREES STIPULATING THAT ALL LOCAL </p><p>LEGISLATION MUST BE BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH THE KORAN </p><p>AND DECREED THE CREATION OF A SHURA (COUNCIL) ACCORDING </p><p>TO SHARIA REGULATIONS.  PRESS REPORTS FURTHER INDICATE </p><p>THAT, IN AN EFFORT TO HASTEN THE TRANSITION TO ISLAMIC </p><p>LAW, THE EXISTING CHECHEN LEGISLATURE WAS STRIPPED OF </p><p>ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS, AND THE POST OF VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT WAS ABOLISHED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE, IN WITH THE SHURA </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 10, CHECHNYA\'S NEWLY-FORMED SHURA </p><p>ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR "CONSULTING" WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MASKHADOV, ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS.  THE CHECHEN </p><p>SHURA IS COMPRISED OF 34 MEMBERS IN ADDITION TO </p><p>MASKHADOV.  THE SHURA INCLUDES SEVERAL PROMINENT </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADERS SUCH AS FORMER PM SHAMIL BASAYEV, </p><p>FORMER VP VAKHA ARSANOV, FORMER PRESIDENT ZELIMKHAN </p><p>YANDERBIYEV, AND OPPOSITION FIELD COMMANDER KHUNKOR- </p><p>PASHA ISRAPILOV.  (NOTE:  ALTHOUGH CHECHEN "WAR LORDS" </p><p>ARBI BARAYEV AND AL-KHATTAB ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>SHURA, OBSERVERS BELIEVE THEY CONTINUE IN THEIR SUPPORT </p><p>OF BASAYEV.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) ALTHOUGH MASKHADOV\'S ACTIONS ARE WIDELY </p><p>BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN AN EFFORT TO CO-OPT HIS EXTREMIST </p><p>OPPOSITION, THE INTRODUCTION OF FULL-SCALE SHARIA AND </p><p>THE CREATION OF A SHURA HAVE NOT CREATED PEACE INSIDE </p><p>THE REBEL REPUBLIC.  THE CHECHEN OPPOSITION, LED MOST </p><p>OFTEN BY BASAYEV, CONTINUED TO EXERT PRESSURE ON </p><p>CHECHEN SOCIETY TO REMOVE MASKHADOV FROM HIS POST AS </p><p>PRESIDENT.  IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE RUSSIAN PRESS ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 23, BASAYEV CLAIMED MASKHADOV\'S INTRODUCTION </p><p>OF SHARIA LAW WAS "INSINCERE," AND ALLEGED THAT AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT SHARIA COURT WILL BE FORMED WHICH WILL </p><p>"DECIDE WHO IS GUILTY" AND RECOMMEND APPROPRIATE </p><p>PUNISHMENT FOR THE "GUILTY."  NO FURTHER DETAILS WERE </p><p>GIVEN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ACCORDING TO CAUCASUS EXPERT ALEKSEY MALASHENKO </p><p>OF THE MOSCOW CARNEGIE CENTER, THE SHURA CREATED IN </p><p>CHECHNYA IS NOT A TRADITIONAL MOSLEM SHURA RUN BY </p><p>RELIGIOUS MEN.  INSTEAD, MALASHENKO BELIEVES, THE </p><p>CHECHEN SHURA IS A COUNCIL OF MILITARY MEN.  MALASHENKO </p><p>CLAIMS THE CHECHENS CAME TO HIM OVER A YEAR AGO AND </p><p>ASKED FOR MATERIALS AND INFORMATION ON SHARIA LAW AND </p><p>BUILDING AN ISLAMIC STATE.  HE SAYS HE ADVISED THEM ON </p><p>THE DIFFICULTY OF MOSLEM CIVIC EDUCATION IN A POST- </p><p>SOVIET SOCIETY, AND GAVE THEM BOOKS ON ISLAM AND SHARIA </p><p>LAW.  AFTER WATCHING THE EVENTS OF THE PAST MONTH, </p><p>MALASHENKO SADLY CONCLUDED THAT NO ONE IN THE CHECHEN </p><p>LEADERSHIP EVER READ THE MATERIAL THEY RECEIVED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>FROM "BAD" TO "WORSE" </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) MASKHADOV\'S MOVE TO INTRODUCE SHARIA AND FORM A </p><p>SHURA BEFORE HIS OPPOSITION BEAT HIM TO IT HAS BEEN MET </p><p>WITH A FLOOD OF HIGH-LEVEL CRITICISM ELSEWHERE. </p><p>COMMUNIST LEADER GENNADIY ZYUGANOV CALLED THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW A "ROLL-BACK TO THE DARK </p><p>AGES" AND PREDICTED A WORSENING OF THE REFUGEE </p><p>SITUATION IN THE REGION.  DEPUTY PM FOR REGIONAL </p><p>AFFAIRS VADIM GUSTOV CHARACTERIZED THE INTRODUCTION OF </p><p>SHARIA AS DIVISIVE, AND CLAIMED IT MAY LEAD TO A </p><p>"YUGOSLAVIA VERSION" OF RUSSIA, AND WILL MEAN "WAR." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) GUSTOV MAY FIND HE HAS LITTLE SUPPORT FOR A </p><p>MILITARY INTERVENTION IN CHECHNYA, HOWEVER.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO A MOSCOW OPINION POLL CONDUCTED ON FEBRUARY 12-14, </p><p>ONLY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE POLLED BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SHOULD USE MILITARY FORCE TO BRING CHECHNYA </p><p>FULLY BACK INTO THE FOLD OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. </p><p>SIXTY-EIGHT PERCENT OPPOSE THE USE FORCE, EVEN THOUGH </p><p>THE MAJORITY OF RESPONDENTS BELIEVE CHECHNYA IS A PART </p><p>OF RUSSIA. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) ALTHOUGH CLEARLY IN THE MINORITY, MODERATE </p><p>VOICES HAVE SPOKEN OUT WITH A "WAIT AND SEE" ATTITUDE </p><p>TOWARDS CHECHEN SHARIA.  SPEAKER OF THE RUSSIAN DUMA, </p><p>GENNADIY SELEZNEV, STATED THAT REGIONAL EXPERTS MUST </p><p>FIRST SPECIFY WHAT KIND OF SHARIA RULE CHECHNYA WILL </p><p>ADOPT OFFICIALLY BEFORE AN OPINION CAN BE FORMED.  THE </p><p>PREDICTABLY MODERATE DAGESTAN-BORN MINISTER FOR </p><p>NATIONALITIES, RAMAZAN ABDULATIPOV, CALLED THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA IN CHECHNYA "A RASH STEP" AND </p><p>STATED THAT MASKHADOV HAS "WEAKENED HIS POSITION" AND </p><p>MAY BE REMOVED FROM HIS PRESIDENTIAL POST AT ANY TIME </p><p>BY THE NEWLY-FORMED SHURA.  ABDULATIPOV ALSO QUESTIONED </p><p>THE ABILITY OF CHECHNYA TO "EXERCISE CIVILIZED ISLAM </p><p>AND SHARIA LAW," POINTING OUT THAT "NO ONE IN CHECHEN </p><p>SOCIETY IS SUFFICIENTLY VERSED ON SHARIA STANDARDS, </p><p>BEGINNING WITH THE PRESIDENT AND ENDING WITH THE FIELD </p><p>COMMANDERS." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE FIRST WEEKS FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF </p><p>SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA HAVE BROUGHT NO RESOLUTION TO </p><p>THE ONGOING POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN PRESIDENT MASKHADOV </p><p>AND THE OPPOSITION FIELD COMMANDERS.  MASKHADOV AND THE </p><p>OPPOSITION HAVE YET TO REVEAL THE "DEGREE" OF SHARIA </p><p>THEY INTEND TO IMPOSE.  THEIR NEWLY-CREATED SHURA DOES </p><p>APPEAR TO BE NO MORE THAN A COUNCIL OF MILITARY MEN, AS </p><p>NO SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP HAS EMERGED FROM THE RUINS OF </p><p>CHECHEN SOCIETY.  ACCORDING TO REGIONAL EXPERTS, THE </p><p>QUESTION OF CHECHNYA\'S ABILITY TO BUILD ANY TYPE OF </p><p>STATE, INCLUDING AN ISLAMIC ONE, REMAINS THE CORE </p><p>ISSUE.  THE OFFICIAL SUSPENSION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW </p><p>IN THE BREAKAWAY REPUBLIC, HOWEVER PRO-FORMA, MAY </p><p>SIGNAL THE FURTHER WORSENING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN </p><p>CHECHNYA AND MOSCOW, PARTICULARLY IF NO COMPROMISE </p><p>FORMULA CAN BRIDGE THE GAP NEEDED TO GIVE SHARIA LAW </p><p>THE VEIL OF CONFORMANCE WITH THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>COLLINS </p><p></p></div>
