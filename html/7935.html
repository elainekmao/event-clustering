Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Closely following up the visit of a </p><p>senior Japanese envoy, Norwegian facilitator Erik </p><p>Solheim met May 8 with Tiger leaders.  The meeting was </p><p>cordial, but the Tigers did not confirm that they will </p><p>come back to the peace talks or attend the June donors </p><p>conference.  Norway\'s FM is expected to visit next week </p><p>to press the case again.  While an impressive display of </p><p>diplomatic activity, the tag team efforts of the GoN and </p><p>the GoJ have not forced the Tigers to buckle yet.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In the latest of the increasingly frenetic tag </p><p>team efforts to engage the Tigers, Norwegian special </p><p>envoy Erik Solheim met with senior Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leaders on May 8.  (Note:  Solheim\'s </p><p>meeting closely follows that of Japanese envoy Yasushi </p><p>Akashi, who met with LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran on May 7 </p><p>-- see Reftel.)  The meeting took place in the LTTE- </p><p>controlled town of Kilinochchi in northern Sri Lanka. </p><p>Present from the Tiger side were chief negotiator Anton </p><p>Balasingham, Sea Tiger leader Soosai (one name only), </p><p>and a number of other LTTE military leaders. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Solheim\'s intervention did not break the </p><p>deadlock over the peace process.  Tomas Stangeland, </p><p>polchief of the Norwegian Embassy, attended the meeting </p><p>and told us late May 8 that Solheim pressed the Tigers </p><p>hard to return to the peace talks and attend the June </p><p>donors conference in Tokyo.  The Tigers would not budge </p><p>from their demand that the GSL had to earn LTTE trust by </p><p>taking steps re delivery of humanitarian assistance and </p><p>reducing military deployments in Jaffna District. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Stangeland added that Solheim had pressed the </p><p>Tigers hard on clear indications that LTTE operatives </p><p>were engaged in a widespread campaign of assassination </p><p>against Tamil opponents (see Reftels).  The Tigers </p><p>denied the charge. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Despite the brush off on substantive issues, </p><p>Stangeland characterized the meeting as quite cordial. </p><p>He thought that it was significant that Balasingham had </p><p>brought Soosai, a well-known LTTE hard-liner, to the </p><p>meeting.  (Note:  The Sea Tigers, the unit Soosai heads, </p><p>has been involved in several violent confrontations with </p><p>the Sri Lankan Navy in recent months.)  Stangeland </p><p>thought this rare exposure of Soosai to international </p><p>diplomacy might have a softening effect within LTTE </p><p>inner circles in the long-term. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Stangeland noted that Solheim had briefed Sri </p><p>Lankan Prime Minister Wickremesinghe late May 8 about </p><p>the meeting with the LTTE earlier in the day. </p><p>In the meantime, the next step in engaging the Tigers </p><p>seems to involve Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan </p><p>Petersen, who is reportedly set to visit Sri Lanka next </p><p>week.  (Note:  Petersen was to visit Sri Lanka earlier </p><p>this year, but his visit had to be postponed because of </p><p>the Iraq situation.)  Petersen will reportedly meet with </p><p>the Tigers in Kilinochchi. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  While an impressive display of </p><p>diplomatic activity, the tag team efforts of the </p><p>Norwegians and the Japanese have not forced the Tigers </p><p>to buckle yet.  With the Japanese-mandated deadline </p><p>(May 14) of one-week slipping away, a decision by the </p><p>Tigers about the June donors conference in Tokyo must be </p><p>made soon.  Our guess is that the inner circle of the </p><p>Tigers will be huddling soon to discuss the group\'s </p><p>future moves.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
