CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ESCUDERO.  REASON: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ACCORDING TO BBC CORRESPONDENT MONICA WHITLOCK </p><p>(PLEASE PROTECT), UZBEK ISLAMIC MILITANT "TAKHIRJON" HAS </p><p>SURFACED IN PESHAWAR.  TAKHIRJON LED THE 1991 "ADOLAT" </p><p>UPRISING WHICH BRIEFLY TOOK OVER THE HOKIMIATE OFFICES IN </p><p>NAMANGAN CITY (IN THE FERGANA VALLEY), DEMANDING AN </p><p>ISLAMIC REPUBLIC.  THE DEMONSTRATION WAS BROKEN UP AND </p><p>TAKHIRJON FLED TO AFGHANISTAN.  OUR INFORMATION UNTIL NOW </p><p>WAS THAT HE, WITH PERHAPS A FEW DOZEN TO A COUPLE HUNDRED </p><p>FIGHTERS, WAS WITH THE TAJIK OPPOSITION IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE SOURCE FOR THE INFORMATION THAT HE IS IN </p><p>PESHAWAR IS HIS BROTHER, PRESUMABLY A RELIABLE ONE.  THE </p><p>BROTHER ALSO TOLD WHITLOCK THAT UZBEK POLICE HAVE </p><p>ARRESTED TWO OF TAKHIRJON\'S OTHER BROTHERS, ONE IN </p><p>SAMARKAND AND THE SECOND IN NAMANGAN.  NEITHER OF THE </p><p>ARRESTED BROTHERS IS ISLAMICALLY ACTIVE, HE CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) WHITLOCK SAID SHE HAS HEARD THAT "JUMABOY </p><p>NAMANGANI," TAKHIRJON\'S DEPUTY COMMANDER, IS NOW IN </p><p>TAVILDARA, TAJIKISTAN, WITH OPPOSITION WARLORD MIRZO RIO. </p><p>SHE NOTED THAT THE BRITISH GOLD MINERS RECENTLY HELD </p><p>HOSTAGE BY MIRZO RIO INITIALLY COMMENTED TO HER THAT THEY </p><p>HAD BEEN SURPRISED BY THE NUMBER OF UZBEKS WITH THE </p><p>WARLORD, BUT THEN REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE ANY </p><p>FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  THE GOU\'S LONG-STANDING FEAR OF ISLAMIC </p><p>ACTIVISTS IS EXACERBATED BY ITS CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>TALIBAN ADVANCE IN AFGHANISTAN.  IN A RECENT CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH THE AMBASSADOR (REFTEL), PRESIDENT KARIMOV LINKED </p><p>THE 1992 ADOLAT UPRISING WITH THE DANGER OF CREEPING </p><p>ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM FROM AFGHANISTAN.  THE ARREST OF </p><p>TAKHIRJON\'S RELATIVES IS ALMOST CERTAINLY LINKED TO THOSE </p><p>SAME FEARS, EVEN THOUGH THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE </p><p>ADOLAT LEADER\'S LOYALTIES LIE MORE WITH THE TAJOPP AND </p><p>AFGHAN TAJIK COMMANDER MASSOUD THAN WITH THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ESCUDERO </p><p></p></div>
