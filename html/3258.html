SHE SPECIFICALLY INVITED AMCHAM MEMBERS TO COME TO </p><p>THE EMBASSY EARLY WHEN THEY HAVE VIEWS, CONCERNS OR SPECIFIC </p><p>INTEREST IN ITALIAN POLICIES/LEGISLATION, EU </p><p>POLICIES/DIRECTIVES OR INTERNATIONAL (WTO, OECD) </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.

THE PROCTER AND GAMBLE REPRESENTATIVE NOTED THAT, WHILE </p><p>IN THE PAST THE FIRM\'S OFFICIALS HAD PREFERRED THAT IT BE </p><p>SEEN AS AN ITALIAN ENTITY (INSTEAD OF AS A BRANCH OPERATION </p><p>OF A U.S. MULTINATIONAL), THIS HAS CHANGED.  THEY NOW </p><p>BELIEVE IT IS IN THEIR INTEREST TO GIVE GREATER VISIBILITY </p><p>TO THEIR U.S. OWNERSHIP AND ARE, THEREFORE, MORE WILLING TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN AMCHAM ACTIVITIES AND ENGAGE IN GREATER </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE EMBASSY.
