<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 RIYADH 004048 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA:  1998 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 202128;  (B) CAIRO 03962 </p><p> </p><p>1.   THE FOLLOWING RESTATES AND RESPONDS TO EACH OF THE QUESTIONS </p><p>SET FORTH IN REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>A.   DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF EACH COUNTRY </p><p>TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 1998, INCLUDING ANY HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTION RELATING TO TERRORISM.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE </p><p>GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT ACTIONS REGARDING ACTS OF TERRORISM </p><p>AGAINST OR AFFECTING U. S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG IS CONTINUING ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE KHOBAR </p><p>TOWERS BOMB ATTACK OF JUNE 1996 WHICH KILLED 19 U. S. MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL.  ALTHOUGH THE SAG REPORTEDLY HAS DETAINED AND </p><p>INTERROGATED SAUDI CITIZENS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBING, IT HAS </p><p>NOT YET BEGUN PROSECUTION OR TAKEN ANY OTHER PUBLIC LEGAL ACTION </p><p>REGARDING ANY SUCH PERSONS.  THERE WERE NO OTHER KNOWN TERRORIST </p><p>CASES OR ACTIONS THAT CAME BEFORE THE JUDICIARY IN 1998. </p><p> </p><p>B.   DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION </p><p>OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR? </p><p>PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO </p><p>U. S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG REQUESTED THAT CANADA DEPORT SAUDI CITIZEN HANI </p><p>AL-SAYEGH TO SAUDI ARABIA IN 1997.  CANADIAN OFFICIALS DETAINED AL- </p><p>SAYEGH IN MARCH 1997 ON CHARGES OF DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUNE </p><p>1996 KHOBAR TOWERS BOMB ATTACK.  CANADA DEPORTED AL-SAYEGH TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AFTER DOCUMENTS LINKING HIM TO SAUDI HIZBALLAH WERE </p><p>PRESENTED TO THE COURT.  THE SAG THEN REQUESTED THAT THE USG DEPORT </p><p>AL-SAYEGH TO SAUDI ARABIA TO QUESTION AND PERHAPS PROSECUTE HIM FOR </p><p>HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING.  THE EXTRADITION </p><p>CASE IS STILL PENDING FINAL DECISION WITH THE IMMIGRATION AND </p><p>NATURALIZATION SERVICE (INS).  THERE HAVE BEEN MEDIA REPORTS THAT </p><p>THE SAG HAS REQUESTED THAT THE TALEBAN GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN </p><p>EXTRADITE SAUDI-BORN TERRORIST FINANCIER AND ORGANIZER USAMA BIN </p><p>LADIN.  BIN LADIN, WHO WAS STRIPPED OF HIS SAUDI CITIZENSHIP IN </p><p>1994, WAS INDICTED ON NOVEMBER 5, 1998 BY A U. S. FEDERAL GRAND </p><p>JURY IN NEW YORK, WHICH ALLEGED THAT HE AND OTHERS ENGAGED IN AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONSPIRACY TO ATTACK U. S. FACILITIES AND TO KILL </p><p>U. S. CITIZENS INCLUDING IN NAIROBI, KENYA AND DAR ES SALAAM, </p><p>TANZANIA ON AUGUST 7, 1998. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTS THAT SAUDI </p><p>AUTHORITIES REQUESTED JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES TO EXTRADITE MUHAMMAD </p><p>AL-MAQDISI, WHO IS SERVING A 15 YEAR SENTENCE IN JORDAN AND HAS </p><p>BEEN LINKED TO THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF USAMA BIN LADIN. </p><p> </p><p>C.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS EXIST TO THE SAG\'S </p><p>PROSECUTION OF PERSONS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>WITHIN SAUDI ARABIA.  HOWEVER, THE SAG HAS NOT ENTERED INTO </p><p>EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE </p><p>UNITED STATES.  (NOTE:  EXTRADITION TREATIES EXIST WITH YEMEN AND </p><p>EGYPT AND THE ARAB LEAGUE ANTI-TERRORIST AGREEMENT (REFTEL B) HAS </p><p>EXTRADITION ARTICLES.) </p><p> </p><p>D.   DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. </p><p>THIS WOULD INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG AT ALL LEVELS, INCLUDING THE KING, CROWN PRINCE, </p><p>MINISTER OF INTERIOR, MINISTER OF INFORMATION, ISLAMIC ULAMA, AND </p><p>OFFICIAL NEWS MEDIA PUBLICLY AND CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNS TERRORISM IN </p><p>UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS, INCLUDING BY MAKING ATTEMPTS TO ERADICATE </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL/RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TERRORISM.  THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE IN HIS OCTOBER WORLD TOUR MADE A POINT TO CONDEMN TERRORISM </p><p>IN ALL ITS FORMS AND TO DENY THAT TERRORISM HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH </p><p>ISLAM.  THE SAG CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING </p><p>AND HAS SHOWN INCREASED COOPERATION IN ITS ASSISTANCE TO THE USG IN </p><p>ITS OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>E.   DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1998 BY </p><p>THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  INTERNALLY, THE SAG CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR </p><p>TOWERS BOMBING.  IT HAS ALSO UNDERTAKEN NUMEROUS MEASURES TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN SECURITY PROTECTION OF U. S. MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC </p><p>PERSONNEL, PARTICULARLY AFTER THE AUGUST BOMBINGS OF U. S. </p><p>EMBASSIES IN EAST AFRICA AND A THREAT AGAINST U. S. FACILITIES IN </p><p>OCTOBER.  INTERNATIONALLY, AT THE TUNIS MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE INTERIOR MINISTERS IN JANUARY, THE SAG JOINED IN THE </p><p>UNANIMOUS ADOPTION OF AN ANTI-TERRORIST COOPERATION ACCORD WHICH </p><p>HAD BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION FOR FOUR YEARS.  THE ACCORD AIMS TO </p><p>ENHANCE INTER-ARAB COOPERATION REGARDING EXTRADITION OF CONVICTED </p><p>TERRORISTS, IMPROVE INFORMATION EXCHANGES ABOUT TERRORISTS\' </p><p>WHEREABOUTS, FINANCES AND SUPPORT NETWORKS, AND STRENGTHEN CONTROLS </p><p>ON TRAVEL AND INFILTRATION OF TERROR SUSPECTS THROUGH ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THE ACCORD (SEE REFTEL B), SIGNED IN CAIRO ON APRIL 22, </p><p>CONTAINS A PLEDGE NOT TO ORDER, FINANCE, OR COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS, </p><p>TO PREVENT TERRORIST CRIMES AND TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM.  THIS </p><p>AGREEMENT WAS RATIFIED BY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS IN RIYADH ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 28.  AT THE 66TH SESSION OF THE GCC MINISTERIAL COUNCIL </p><p>HELD IN RIYADH IN MARCH, THE GCC MINISTERS REJECTED "ALL FORMS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM WHEREVER THEY COME FROM."  AT A DOHA MEETING </p><p>OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ISLAMIC CONFERENCE (OIC) MINISTERS, ALSO </p><p>IN MARCH,  THE MEMBERS URGED ISLAMIC COUNTRIES TO CONDEMN TERRORISM </p><p>IN ALL OF ITS ASPECTS, NOT TO PROVIDE SANCTUARY FOR TERRORISTS, AND </p><p>TO HELP BRING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE.  THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR </p><p>CALLED ON MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND U. N. MEMBER STATES TO REACH AN </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM ACCORD SIMILAR TO THE ONE SIGNED BY ARAB LEAGUE </p><p>NATIONS IN APRIL.  FINALLY, AT THE UNGA 53RD SESSION IN SEPTEMBER, </p><p>THE SAUDI ASSISTANT FOREIGN MINISTER REJECTED ANY LINK BETWEEN THE </p><p>RELIGION OF ISLAM AND TERRORISM, AND STATED THAT "THE KINGDOM </p><p>REJECTS VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM IN ANY FORM OR SHAPE."  HE CALLED </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL ACTIONS THROUGH THE U. N. TO BRING ABOUT THE </p><p>TERMINATION OF TERRORISM AND CALLED FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION </p><p>TO FIGHT THE SHELTERING OF TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>F.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS, INCLUDING </p><p>(BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS </p><p>OR THEIR ACTIVITIES; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RECOGNITION; MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC </p><p>PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; PROVISION OF SANCTUARY AND/OR </p><p>PRESENCE OF OFFICES OF TERRORIST GROUPS; PROVISION OF TRAINING OR </p><p>TRAINING SITES; PROVISION OF WEAPONS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON </p><p>TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG DOES NOT FINANCIALLY SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR ACTIVITIES.  ITS REGULATIONS REQUIRE </p><p>THAT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY AGENCIES </p><p>OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO SOLICIT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR </p><p>DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL CAUSES, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT </p><p>THIS IS ENFORCED CONSISTENTLY.  NONETHELESS, THERE CONTINUE TO BE </p><p>ALLEGATIONS THAT SOME INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES SOLICIT AND COLLECT PRIVATE FUNDS IN SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p>THE SAG CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNS TERRORISM.  HOWEVER, SHEIKH AHMAD </p><p>YASIN, THE FOUNDER OF HAMAS, VISITED SAUDI ARABIA FOR HAJJ AND </p><p>MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND MET CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH IN APRIL. </p><p> </p><p>G.   HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  (THE SEVEN </p><p>GOVERNMENTS DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY AS STATE SPONSORS OF </p><p>TERRORISM ARE CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA, AND </p><p>SUDAN.) </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG DID NOT MAKE ANY OFFICIAL PUBLIC STATEMENTS </p><p>SUPPORTING ANY OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES ON THE USG\'S TERRORISM LIST </p><p>REGARDING A TERRORIST ISSUE.  HOWEVER, THE SAG ALLOWED A LIBYAN </p><p>AIRCRAFT CARRYING 105 HAJJ PILGRIMS TO LAND AT JEDDAH\'S </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ON MARCH 29 AND TO DEPART THE SAME DAY, IN </p><p>VIOLATION OF UNSC SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>H.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1997, POSITIVE OR </p><p>NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE AUGUST 1998 BOMBING OF U. S. EMBASSIES IN DAR ES </p><p>SALAAM AND NAIROBI FURTHER HEIGHTENED AWARENESS AND CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>ATTEMPTS THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN SAUDI ARABIA, FOLLOWING THE 1995 AND </p><p>1996 ATTACKS AGAINST U. S. TARGETS.  ALL OF THESE ATTACKS MET WITH </p><p>OFFICIAL CONDEMNATION, AND HAVE SPURRED GREATER COOPERATION AMONG </p><p>SAUDI SECURITY ORGANS IN ADDRESSING INTERNAL SECURITY ISSUES.  THE </p><p>SAG HAS SUBSTANTIALLY INTENSIFIED ITS DIALOGUE WITH GCC AND OTHER </p><p>ARAB AND ISLAMIC COUNTRIES ON COMBATING TERRORISM.  THE SAUDI ANTI- </p><p>TERRORISM STANCE WAS GIVEN A WORLD-WIDE STAGE DURING THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE\'S MONTH-LONG VISIT TO EUROPE, THE U. S., AND ASIA.  THE </p><p>SAUDI GOVERNMENT REMAINS CONCERNED WITH A CONTINUED TERRORIST </p><p>PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN, ESPECIALLY THOSE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>USAMA BIN LADIN, A TERRORIST FINANCIER AND ORGANIZER OF SAUDI </p><p>ORIGIN, AND DOWNGRADED ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TALEBAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>IN SEPTEMBER.  BIN LADIN WAS INDICTED IN NEW YORK IN NOVEMBER FOR </p><p>PROMOTING TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>I.  DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH </p><p>RESPECT TO THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, </p><p>SPECIFIC U.S. REQUESTS TO THE HOST GOVERNMENT FOR COOPERATION AND </p><p>EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES IN THE HOST COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO TERRORIST GROUPS </p><p>DIRECTLY OR IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.  DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF </p><p>THE HOST COUNTRY\'S COOPERATION WITH THOSE EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS SATISFIED THE </p><p>SPECIFIC REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  BEGINNING WITH THE 1996 VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA OF A USG </p><p>INTERAGENCY COUNTERTERRORISM TEAM FOLLOWING THE 1995 OPM/SANG </p><p>BOMBING, THE USG AND THE SAG ENTERED INTO UNPRECEDENTED, </p><p>COORDINATED, INTERAGENCY CONSULTATIONS ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND </p><p>SECURITY ISSUES WHICH ENGENDERED HIGH-LEVEL SAG INTEREST AND THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE SAG MINISTRIES.  THIS INTEREST AND </p><p>PARTICIPATION HAS CONTINUED AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THROUGHOUT </p><p>1998.  THE USG AND SAG EXCHANGE INFORMATION ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND </p><p>SECURITY ISSUES AFFECTING AMERICAN AND SAUDI INTERESTS IN THE </p><p>REGION.  CONSULTATIONS AND TRAINING FOR SAUDI COUNTERTERRORISM AND </p><p>SECURITY OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES ALSO OCCURRED.  FOLLOWING </p><p>THE 1996 KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING, THE USG AND THE SAG FURTHER </p><p>INCREASED COOPERATION.  FBI DIRECTOR LOUIS FREEH VISITED SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA TWICE IN 1996 TO COORDINATE INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS WITH SAUDI </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTER PRINCE NAIF.  THE FBI MAINTAINS A PERMANENTLY </p><p>STAFFED LEGAL ATTACHE OFFICE IN THE U. S. EMBASSY.  WHILE </p><p>COOPERATION THROUGHOUT 1998 ON THE KHOBAR TOWERS INVESTIGATION WAS </p><p>STRONG, FOLLOWING THE EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS IN AUGUST IT WAS </p><p>INCREASED FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>J.   IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL INFORMATION, IF THE UNITED STATES </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION FROM THE HOST GOVERNMENT DURING </p><p>THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF AN </p><p>ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS OR </p><p>INTERESTS, PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON: </p><p> </p><p>     (I)  THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN APPREHENDING, </p><p>CONVICTING, AND PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE ACT; AND </p><p> </p><p>     (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING IN PREVENTING FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED </p><p>STATES CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  (I) THE SAG HAS SOUGHT TO APPREHEND, CONVICT, AND PUNISH </p><p>THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH THE OPM/SANG AND KHOBAR TOWERS </p><p>BOMBINGS AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS.  IN THIS REGARD, ON APRIL </p><p>22, 1996 FOUR SAUDI NATIONALS PUBLICLY CONFESSED TO COMMITTING THE </p><p>OPM/SANG BOMBING OF NOVEMBER 1995 AND THEY WERE EXECUTED ON MAY 31. </p><p>THE SAG HAS COOPERATED WITH THE USG, ALTHOUGH EARLIER STAGES OF THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP DID NOT ALWAYS MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF USG OFFICIALS. </p><p>SAUDI OFFICIALS AND THE FBI HAVE WORKED CLOSELY ON MANY </p><p>INVESTIGATION ISSUES RELATED TO BOTH BOMBINGS AND CONTINUE TO </p><p>CONSULT CLOSELY ON THE STATUS OF THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING </p><p>INVESTIGATION. </p><p> </p><p>          (II) THE SAG HAS DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE HUMAN AND FINANCIAL </p><p>RESOURCES TO PROTECT USG PERSONNEL AND INTERESTS FOLLOWING THE </p><p>OPM/SANG, KHOBAR TOWERS, AND EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS.  IT MADE </p><p>AVAILABLE TO COALITION FORCES THE PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE AT AL </p><p>KHARJ, WHERE MOST U. S. SERVICEMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA ARE NOW LOCATED, </p><p>AND A VERY LARGE RESIDENTIAL COMPOUND, KNOWN AS ESKAN VILLAGE, </p><p>SOUTH OF RIYADH FOR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DOD PERSONNEL.  THE SAG </p><p>SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FACILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS.  THE SAG ALSO WORKED WITH AMERICAN SECURITY PERSONNEL </p><p>TO ENHANCE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AT ALL OTHER USG FACILITIES IN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA, INCLUDING THE U. S. EMBASSY IN RIYADH AND THE CONSULATES </p><p>GENERAL IN JEDDAH AND DHAHRAN.  USG AND SAG OFFICIALS FROM THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVELS DOWN CONTINUE TO MEET REGULARLY TO REVIEW THE SAFETY </p><p>OF AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>K.   IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION DURING </p><p>THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U. S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE </p><p>DESCRIBE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING IN PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES </p><p>CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG HAS PROVIDED TO THE USG INFORMATION ON THREATS </p><p>DIRECTED AT U. S. INTERESTS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND CONTINUES TO LIAISE </p><p>CLOSELY WITH USG AGENCIES TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST </p><p>AMERICANS IN THE KINGDOM.  THREATS HAVE REGULARLY LED TO THE RAPID </p><p>DEPLOYMENT OF EXTRA SECURITY PERSONNEL AND THE PLACEMENT OF </p><p>PERMANENT PHYSICAL BARRIERS, CHECKPOINTS, AND OTHER VISIBLE </p><p>DETERRENTS. </p><p> </p><p>FOWLER </p><p></p></div>
