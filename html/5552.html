<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000262 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PAPER REFUSES TO APOLOGIZE FOR </p><p>DISTORTED REPORTING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   On January 25, UN WFP Envoy James Morris took the </p><p>      government-owned "Herald" to task for gross distortions </p><p>      in their report of his remarks after a January 24 </p><p>      meeting with Robert Mugabe.  Morris characterized the </p><p>      "Herald\'s" article as "100 percent lies." </p><p> </p><p>  2.   On January 29, Japan\'s Ambassador to Zimbabwe </p><p>      wrote a letter to the "Herald" complaining bitterly of </p><p>      the paper\'s "fabrications" and "misrepresentations" in </p><p>      their January 28 report about his meeting with </p><p>      Information Minister Jonathan Moyo. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   On February 4, U.S. Ambassador Sullivan wrote the </p><p>      "Herald" to refute the paper\'s false account of his </p><p>      effort to be allowed to observe the Morgan Tsvangirai </p><p>      trial. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   On February 6, the "Herald" responded to this </p><p>      string of journalistic mistakes with a defensive </p><p>      editorial entitled  "Mistakes are different from </p><p>      falsehoods."  Excerpts follow. </p><p> </p><p>  5.   "Newspapers throughout the world are not immune to </p><p>      making mistakes and `The Herald\' is no exception. </p><p>      However, there is a clear distinction between a mistake </p><p>      and publishing falsehoods.  Any newspaper worth its </p><p>      salt knows that it is a cardinal sin to create </p><p>      fictitious stories, as this is detrimental to its </p><p>      credibility.  It is, indeed, normal for different </p><p>      publications or broadcasters to make divergent </p><p>      interpretations to a news event.  It is in this regard </p><p>      that `The Herald\' takes great exception to attempts by </p><p>      the discredited opposition mouthpiece, `The Daily </p><p>      News,\' to equate mistakes made by this newspaper to </p><p>      lies published by `The Daily News. . .\' </p><p> </p><p>      "It is every newspaper\'s journalistic right to </p><p>      put into context, rightly or wrongly, statements </p><p>      made by public officials.  There is nothing new </p><p>      in this.  It is only foolishness or malice to </p><p>      say our interpretation was a quote because it </p><p>      clearly was not written as such. . .  So we have </p><p>      no apologies to make to either Ambassador Liyama </p><p>      or Special Envoy Morris for doing our job as </p><p>      journalists but it is their job to be </p><p>      categorical when answering reporters\' questions. </p><p>      If either Special Envoy Morris or Ambassador </p><p>      Liyama believe we have contravened any law, we </p><p>      are ready to have that tested and determined in </p><p>      a court of law and not on the pages of an </p><p>      opposition newspaper." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
