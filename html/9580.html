<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001475 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/FO A/S KANSTEINER AND AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA SR DIR JENDAYII FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC RELATES MORE CONTACTS ABOUT DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) Contacts with ZANU-PF: MDC President Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai and Secretary General Welshman Ncube told the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Ambassador over lunch July 22 that Zanu-PF and the South </p><p>African Government(SAG) had reached out to them recently. </p><p>ZANU-PF Minister for Justice and Parliamentary Affairs </p><p>Patrick Chinamasa had contacted Ncube to negotiate for the </p><p>MDC\'s attendance/non-boycott of President Mugabe\'s July 22 </p><p>speech opening the parliamentary session.  The MDC had </p><p>requested a number of concessions by ZANU-PF, including no </p><p>arrests or harassment of its parliamentarians and freedom to </p><p>campaign in late August urban council and parliamentary </p><p>bi-elections.  MDC received sufficient assurances by late </p><p>July 21 to agree that its MP\'s and even Tsvangirai (a non-MP) </p><p>would attend the session.  The agreement came too late to </p><p>affect ZANU-PF from blockading and preventing MDC from </p><p>registering its local council candidates in a number of </p><p>traditional ZANU-PF strongholds, but Tsvangirai was told that </p><p>registration of candidates would be re-opened in these areas. </p><p> MDC is publicly characterizing its attendance at parliament </p><p>as a goodwill gesture intended to facilitate dialogue and </p><p>hopes privately that it can stimulate some positive steps </p><p>toward dialogue on both sides.  How delicate and top-centered </p><p>ZANU is, however, was reflected when Speaker Mnangagwa had to </p><p>call President Mugabe personally a few minutes before the </p><p>parliamentary session to confirm that he should issue </p><p>invitations to Tsvangirai, even though it was Chinamasa who </p><p>had urged Tsvangirai to attend.  Mugabe\'s speech was </p><p>unremarkable and absent inflammatory rhetoric, although </p><p>filled with delusions about the wonderful state of the </p><p>Zimbabwean agriculture, tourism, etc. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) South African Outreach: According to Ncube, the South </p><p>African High Commissioner has also been pressing MDC and </p><p>ZANU-PF for more progress toward dialogue.  The MDC told him </p><p>it was ready for dialogue now without conditions. SAG HC Ndou </p><p>also met with Minister for State Security Goche on this </p><p>subject and Goche told Ncube on July 22 that he would be </p><p>traveling to South Africa to meet with President Mbeki\'s </p><p>people on the dialogue issue. Comment: The most encouraging </p><p>part of the South African contacts is Goche sharing with </p><p>Ncube about his upcoming meeting with the South Africans. End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MDC Plans: The MDC issued a statement July 22 on his </p><p>openness to dialogue on issues of national emergency (text </p><p>being faxed to AF/S). The intent is to make clear that the </p><p>burden is on ZANU to address the national crisis by entering </p><p>into dialogue.  MDC will also work hard in late August\'s </p><p>elections to demonstrate its firm hold on urban areas.  MDC </p><p>is working on for release in the next several months a </p><p>platform of policies in order to demonstrate that it has </p><p>economic and political proposals for a transition or </p><p>post-election period. The MDC will continue its </p><p>party-building activities and its training in non-violence, </p><p>but has no mass action activities planned for the near term. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  The MDC was clearly thrown off balance by </p><p>its failure to organize successful demonstrations in early </p><p>June, but it appears to have recovered its equilibrium and to </p><p>be pursuing a more patient course.  ZANU-PF\'s triumphalism </p><p>has begun to run itself out, as the country\'s economic and </p><p>political crisis continues.  Whether this is the sort of </p><p>mutually hurting stalemate that can lead to successful </p><p>dialogue/negotiations remains to be seen, since it requires </p><p>not only the assent of many in ZANU-PF, but also of the </p><p>ultimate hard-liner Robert Mugabe. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
