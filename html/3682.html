(C) Summary: On August 28 WHA Assistant Secretary Otto </p><p>Reich visited with Honduran Minister of Defense Federico </p><p>Breve Travieso and Chief of the Joint Staff General Jose </p><p>Isaias Barahona.  The meeting covered a variety of topics, </p><p>including the Cerro La Mole radar, border conflicts with </p><p>Nicaragua and El Salvador, the potential U.S. gift of six </p><p>UH-1 helicopters and the needs of the Honduran Armed Forces </p><p>(HOAF) with respect to the battle against trafficking of </p><p>drugs and arms.  The following day, A/S Reich met with the </p><p>President of the Supreme Court of Justice Vilma Morales and </p><p>other justices. Their meeting focused on anticorruption and </p><p>judicial reform and independence.  A/S Reich also toured one </p><p>of Honduras\'s new courtrooms built to implement its new </p><p>adversarial criminal procedure, a key U.S.-sponsored legal </p><p>reform.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>MOD REVIEWS DRUGS, ARMS, HELOS AND AN AIRPORT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On August 28, WHA A/S Reich visited with Honduran </p><p>Minister of Defense Federico Breve Travieso (MOD) and Chief </p><p>of the Joint Staff General Jose Isaias Barahona at the </p><p>Estado Mayor Conjuntos (the Honduran equivalent of the Joint </p><p>Staff).  He was greeted by a formal honor guard and joined </p><p>by WHA/CEN Director Paul Trivelli, the DCM, PolCouns, </p><p>Defense Attache, MilGrp Commander and PolMilOff (notetaker). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The MOD assured A/S Reich that the Honduran Armed </p><p>Forces (HOAF) wants to work with the U.S. in the battle </p><p>against drug and arms trafficking.  Breve outlined a </p><p>plethora of problems of the HOAF, focusing on communication </p><p>deficiencies that severely hinder Honduras\'s effectiveness </p><p>in situations that require an immediate response.  The MOD </p><p>raised the issue of the Cerro La Mole radar and the failure </p><p>of the U.S. to contribute to maintenance costs of the </p><p>facility.  A/S Reich assured the MOD that the U.S. is </p><p>engaged on this issue and is looking for a solution.  (See </p><p>reftel A for background information on this issue.)  Breve </p><p>asked about the possibility of obtaining Plan Colombia funds </p><p>to aid the HOAF\'s efforts to interdict drugs passing through </p><p>Honduras to the U.S.  A/S Reich explained restrictions on </p><p>the manner in which Plan Colombia money can be spent. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MOD Breve also raised the U.S. offer to give the HOAF </p><p>six used UH-1 helicopters.  The GOH must pay $4 million to </p><p>refurbish the helicopter to make them flight-worthy before </p><p>they can receive the UH-1s.  However, Breve advised the A/S </p><p>that his ministry\'s budget is too tight at this moment to </p><p>pay for the repairs and asked if the U.S. could fund these </p><p>repairs or assist in finding an alternative solution.  The </p><p>MOD stressed that the helicopters would enhance Honduras\' </p><p>ability to participate in counternarcotics activities. </p><p>MILGRP Commander explained that U.S. funds were not </p><p>available and that the cost of the repairs unfortunately had </p><p>to be borne by the recipient nation. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Breve broached the subject of the proposed conversion </p><p>of the Soto Cano military airstrip into an international </p><p>airport for commercial use.  President Maduro embraces the </p><p>concept, which seeks to transform the Comayagua valley into </p><p>a new commercial center by bolstering Honduras\'s capacity to </p><p>export cargo and import tourists.  (See reftel B for </p><p>additional information about this proposal to convert the </p><p>military airstrip (shared by the HOAF and Joint Task Force </p><p>Bravo) into a facility that would accommodate both </p><p>commercial air traffic and military operations.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>SUPPORTING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND PROMOTING REFORM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On August 29, A/S Reich (accompanied by Ambassador, </p><p>WHA/CEN Director Trivelli, DCM, PolCouns, USAID Deputy </p><p>Director, USAID FSN and PolOff) met with Supreme Court </p><p>President Vilma Morales and five justices in the Court\'s </p><p>conference chambers.  Morales and A/S Reich discussed at </p><p>length the problem of corruption and the role the judiciary </p><p>plays in combating it.  A/S Reich stressed the importance of </p><p>an independent judiciary in a democratic system, and of </p><p>judicial transparency and the rule of law in building the </p><p>confidence of the international investment community.  A/S </p><p>Reich and Morales talked about the strides Honduras has made </p><p>in the area of judicial and legal reform, including the new </p><p>selection process for Supreme Court judges (designed to </p><p>depoliticize the Court) and the new Code of Criminal </p><p>Procedure that established an adversarial system of </p><p>prosecution.  (For a detailed account of anticorruption </p><p>efforts in Honduras, see reftel C.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador Almaguer raised the issue of the </p><p>Congress\'s recently proposed Constitutional amendment that </p><p>strips the Court of its authority to interpret the </p><p>constitutionality of the laws and bestows it upon the </p><p>Congress itself.  (Note: Post will provide more information </p><p>about this ongoing judicial conflict via septel.  End Note.) </p><p>Judges Marco T. Barahona and Ovidio Navarro weighed in on </p><p>this topic, highlighting the need for civil society and </p><p>other sectors, especially the G-15 group and U.S., to </p><p>support the Court in its battle for independence and the </p><p>maintenance of separation of powers. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The delegation toured a newly constructed courtroom </p><p>designed to implement the country\'s new criminal procedures </p><p>code, which uses a prosecutorial system vice the previous </p><p>inquistorial one and which requires oral trials with </p><p>witnesses and juries.  The new criminal procedures code is </p><p>one of the most important U.S. sponsored legal reforms to be </p><p>enacted in Honduras. Judge Jorge Alberto Burgos Cordova from </p><p>the Honduran Sentencing Tribunal gave a brief presentation </p><p>that outlined how the recent reforms to the criminal process </p><p>are already beginning to yield more equal justice under law. </p><p>(Note: Judge Burgos formerly served as a prosecutor, during </p><p>which time he came very close to death when would-be </p><p>assassins shot him 17 times.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
