DRAWING ON REFTEL TALKING </p><p>POINTS, CHARGE URGED ZIMBABWE TO OPPOSE, OR AT A </p><p>MINIMUM, ABSTAIN ON CUBA\'S UNGA RESOLUTION CONDEMNING </p><p>THE U.S. BILATERAL EMBARGO ON CUBA.  CHINGONO RESPONDED </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE VOTED FOR THE SAME RESOLUTION LAST YEAR IN </p><p>HOPE OF MAINTAINING ITS GOOD RELATIONS WITH CUBA.  EVEN </p><p>IF ZIMBABWE VOTES IN FAVOR AGAIN THIS YEAR, ZIMBABWE </p><p>HOPES THAT IT CAN USE ITS INFLUENCE TO CONVINCE CUBA TO </p><p>RESUME A DIALOGUE WITH THE UNITED STATES, HE STATED. </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMAT REPORTED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>ASKED CUBA FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF ITS U.S. RELATIONSHIP, </p><p>AND CUBA RESPONDED THAT IT DETECTS NO MEANINGFUL CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>2.

ZIMBABWE WANTS TO AVOID MAKING THESE UNGA </p><p>RESOLUTIONS A RITUAL, AND INTENDS TO RE-EVALUATE THE </p><p>SITUATION IN CUBA EVERY YEAR, BUT OFTEN DOES NOT HAVE </p><p>THE PERTINENT INFORMATION TO MAKE AN INFORMED VOTE. </p><p>ZIMBABWE APPRECIATES ANY INFORMATION THE U.S. CAN </p><p>PROVIDE, CHINGONO CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.

THERE ARE TOO MANY STRONG TIES, AND </p><p>PARALLELS, BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND CUBA FOR ZIMBABWE TO </p><p>ABSTAIN OR VOTE AGAINST ITS OLDEST ALLY IN THE AMERICAS. </p><p>THERE ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT 100 LOW-COST DOCTORS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE FROM CUBA, AND PRESIDENT MUGABE LIKELY VIEWS </p><p>CASTRO AS A FELLOW-IN-ARMS BESIEGED BY A HOSTILE WEST. </p><p>MUGABE ALSO LIKELY SEES THIS VOTE AS A COST-FREE CHANCE </p><p>TO POKE THE U.S. IN THE EYE OVER WHAT HE PERCEIVED WAS </p><p>AN ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON ZIMBABWE WITH THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT.
