<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004423 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: UNCONTRITE SEZER TELLS AMBASSADOR IRAQ </p><p>INCIDENT WAS "UNACCEPTABLE." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson.  Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador paid a farewell visit July 14 on President </p><p>Sezer, who while maintaining his usually low-key and </p><p>disinterested demeanor reiterated several times his public </p><p>charge that the July 4 arrest (and subsequent release) of </p><p>Turkish Special Forces (TSF) troops in Iraq was </p><p>"unacceptable" under any circumstances.  Sezer shook his head </p><p>"no" vigorously on several different occasions, while </p><p>Ambassador was relating that U.S. forces had strong reasons </p><p>for their actions.  Sezer noted the mil/mil commission was </p><p>continuing its work; he expressed hope that its conclusions </p><p>would provide a clearer understanding and basis for </p><p>U.S.-Turkey relations in the future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador replied that there are two distinct issues </p><p>involved in the matter: 1) how TSF were treated; and 2) the </p><p>more fundamental issue, which is the fact that the U.S. </p><p>forces had solid reasons to be concerned about violent </p><p>activities planned by the TSF inimical to stability in Iraq. </p><p>It is thus the purpose of the joint Fact-Finding Team to </p><p>examine both issues.  The USG understands the emotions on the </p><p>Turkish side; it is important, however, to lower the </p><p>temperature of deliberations and to ensure the development of </p><p>coordination procedures that will prevent such things from </p><p>happening again.  Ambassador noted that relations between the </p><p>U.S. and Turkish militaries -- which for fifty years had been </p><p>a pillar of the wider U.S.-Turkey relationship -- are </p><p>strained; both sides should do the utmost to improve the </p><p>atmosphere.  Gens. Abizaid and Jones are coming to Turkey </p><p>July 18, F.M. Gul is planning a visit to the U.S. thereafter; </p><p>such visits are very important to helping put the bilateral </p><p>relationship back on track.  Ambassador reiterated that, </p><p>frankly, Turkey needed to understand that the U.S. units </p><p>involved had reason to act, even if the way the action </p><p>unfolded on the ground raised questions in Turkey about its </p><p>propriety.  Ambassador elaborated that the USG is working to </p><p>demonstrate that Turkey and the U.S. share the same broad </p><p>perspective on Iraq, which given turkey\'s geographical </p><p>advantages would go a long way to encouraging and promoting </p><p>Turkish business and other interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Sezer reiterated that the incident was unacceptable, </p><p>then volunteered the following as context: U.S.-Turkey </p><p>relations were fine, he said, until the March 1 failure in </p><p>Parliament of the Government\'s resolution that would have </p><p>allowed U.S. troop deployments to and through Turkey.  "The </p><p>United States said that its main reasons for going to war in </p><p>Iraq were the WMD threat and the need to democratize the </p><p>country.  I don\'t know if you have any WMD data yet, but as </p><p>for democratization: the Turkish constitution gives the </p><p>Parliament the authority to make such decisions.  So, while </p><p>the U.S. campaigns for democracy in Iraq you should not </p><p>complain about democracy in another country."  The AK </p><p>Government may have wanted the resolution to pass, Sezer </p><p>said, but the decision was up to the legislature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Sezer is politically tone deaf.  He adhered to the </p><p>Turkish hard-liners\' view regarding the July 4 incident; he </p><p>also showed a lack of interest in seeking ground that would </p><p>allow both Turkey and the U.S. to put the issue in context </p><p>and bilateral relations back on track. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
