The mass appeal papers </p><p>published an "emergency special edition" right after the </p><p>news broke about the initial bombing.  Today the general </p><p>tone is about the ongoing missile attacks as well as </p><p>speculation as to the reason for the early bombing.  Reports </p><p>claim that CIA-based intelligence reports had revealed the </p><p>locating about Saddam and his aides.  Several papers report </p><p>that the heavy bombardment continues with Cruise missiles, </p><p>while the ground operation has been launched from the south. </p><p>"Milliyet" reports that US troops captured two Iraqi cities </p><p>in the southern port area.  All major Turkish papers are </p><p>filing their stories on the war by using international wire </p><p>service reports to supplement information from their </p><p>correspondents in Baghdad or Kuwait.  "Hurriyet" reports </p><p>that, unlike in the Gulf war, Turkey and the US have lost </p><p>direct contact. In 1991 then-president Bush notified Turkey </p><p>an hour before the war began, but this time Turkish leaders </p><p>learned of the war from Turkish liaison officers in Tampa, </p><p>FL.  Papers also note the ongoing discussions between Turkey </p><p>and the US about the terms and conditions of the overflight </p><p>permission.  "Yeni Safak" blames the government for hurrying </p><p>to pass the resolution from parliament before reaching </p><p>agreement on a related MOU.  Several papers mention that </p><p>Turkey wants to link the use of Turkish airspace with a </p><p>Turkish army incursion into northern Iraq.  The discussion </p><p>about the shape of the MOU continued until early this </p><p>morning, but to no avail.  "Hurriyet" quotes Ankara </p><p>diplomatic sources as saying "Turkey is waiting for certain </p><p>answers from Washington at this point." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>From the internal standpoint, the overall tone in the press </p><p>is that the AKP government has made an historical mistake </p><p>and has handled the issue very badly.  News reports and many </p><p>editorial comments are questioning the decisions reached by </p><p>policy-makers.  They note that Turkey was `dreaming\' by </p><p>believing that the US had no `Plan B\' for the war, and that </p><p>Turkey\'s resistance could prevent the war from occurring. </p><p>"Hurriyet" editor-in-chief Ertugrul Ozkok slams the AKP and </p><p>their advisers as being "completely blind," and notes that </p><p>Turkey will have to pay the negative consequences in the </p><p>years to come.  "Sabah" reports statements by former Foreign </p><p>Minister Yakis, who admitted that they all believed that </p><p>`Plan B\' did not exist.  Yakis said "evidently we were wrong </p><p>and made a very serious strategic mistake."  Islamist "Yeni </p><p>Safak" pursues a different tone, calling on the world to </p><p>stop the war.  The front-page banner headline reads </p><p>"illegitimate and unlawful."  Ultra-nationalist "Ortadogu" </p><p>characterizes the war as "a blood feud," and predicts that </p><p>it will last much longer than expected.  Stories in the </p><p>press also highlight the "different priorities" within the </p><p>AKP administration, citing PM Erdogan\'s visit to a small </p><p>Anatolian city in the midst of war preparations.  In an </p><p>effort to convince the AKP to accept the overflight </p><p>proposal, Tayyip Erdogan told his party members that there </p><p>will not be a `third resolution\' in the future.  "When I was </p><p>in Corum (a town in Central Anatolia) I understood that </p><p>nobody cares about Iraq.  They are thinking about the </p><p>poverty they face in everyday life." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  War on Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Pluses and minuses" </p><p>Sedat Ergin analyzed the current status of US-Turkish </p><p>relations in light of the war on Iraq in mass appeal </p><p>Hurriyet (3/21): "The results of the bargain between </p><p>Turkey\'s AKP government and the US administration can be </p><p>summed up as follows: </p><p>The most important and valuable gain for Turkey is the </p><p>agreement with the US on the political principles of </p><p>reshaping Iraq.  Most important is the declaration that </p><p>Iraq\'s resources belong to all peoples of Iraq.  Naming the </p><p>Turkomen as one of Iraq\'s founding peoples is also a very </p><p>important gain for Turkey. . On the other hand, there is </p><p>still uncertainty about the Turkish army\'s role in northern </p><p>Iraq.  If Turkey remains persistent on that issue, most </p><p>probably the two sides will reach a consensus in the days </p><p>ahead. . On the economic front, what Turkey received from </p><p>the US seems to be no more than a one-page press release </p><p>issued by the US Embassy in Ankara.  We all knew that </p><p>Washington supports Turkey\'s economic reform program - that </p><p>is not news. . When it comes to the political losses, it </p><p>would require another full-page commentary.  Due to the fact </p><p>that Washington is now implementing `Plan B\' for the Iraq </p><p>operation, there is a serious `crack\' in the way Washington </p><p>now sees Ankara.  Just like a crack in a vase, the healing </p><p>will take time and the crack will remain visible even at the </p><p>end. . Given the current picture, we can conclude that </p><p>Turkey\'s strategic importance has also suffered an erosion. </p><p>Once the war is over, for instance, Incirlik airbase will </p><p>lose its vitality as the US moves to the Middle East." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The wrong calculation" </p><p>Sami Kohen commented in mass appeal Milliyet (3/21): "The </p><p>war on Iraq began in an unusual way.  Evidently, CIA </p><p>intelligence reports led to the conclusion that Saddam and </p><p>his aides could be located and targeted.  However, the </p><p>missiles went to the wrong address and, as we have seen, </p><p>Saddam Hussein went on live television just three hours </p><p>later.  In the event that Saddam had been killed, the war </p><p>may have ended.  It seems that it was an idea endorsed by </p><p>President Bush as well, but it did not succeed.  . The </p><p>current war poses a series of dangers to the international </p><p>community, including the US.  From the military standpoint, </p><p>in addition to the possibility that Saddam will use chemical </p><p>or biological weapons, there are big risks for the US both </p><p>in the growing negative public reaction and the possible </p><p>rise in international terrorism.  From the political point </p><p>of view, the US action is perceived as unilateral, which </p><p>puts the US gradually in a state of alienation and also </p><p>alters existing international balances.  From the economic </p><p>standpoint, the repercussions of the war will be on a global </p><p>scale, and weak economies will be most badly affected." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
