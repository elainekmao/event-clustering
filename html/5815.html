<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000282 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, DRL, AND DRL/CRA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT:  USG promotion of human rights in Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  State 13790 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Per Reftel, Mission\'s response to the request for </p><p>information on how we are promoting human rights in Sri </p><p>Lanka follows: </p><p> </p><p>2.  PEACE PROCESS:  The ongoing peace process has had </p><p>more of a direct and dramatic impact on improving the </p><p>human rights situation in Sri Lanka than any other </p><p>factor during the past year.  Mission contributes to the </p><p>peace process in numerous ways, including through </p><p>consistent and high-level use of public diplomacy tools, </p><p>and also private interaction with key actors.  Another </p><p>visible means of assistance was the donation of </p><p>approximately USD 500,000 to help start up the GSL\'s </p><p>Peace Secretariat.  The Secretariat is still using those </p><p>funds.  USAID has also contributed close to USD 1.5 </p><p>million to support the peace process through several </p><p>projects, including the provision of technical experts </p><p>to the Peace Secretariat and for outreach programs to </p><p>engage the public.  Other programs to assist and </p><p>reinforce the peace process are being considered. </p><p> </p><p>3.  LEAHY CHECKS/MILITARY:  In the past, Mission has on </p><p>occasion refused training for certain security force </p><p>personnel because of their possible involvement in human </p><p>rights violations.  Mission has informed the Sri Lankan </p><p>security forces of the necessity of conducting a human </p><p>rights based background check on personnel recommended </p><p>for training.  The past year has seen the security </p><p>forces become more self-limiting as to who is nominated </p><p>for proposed training programs.  In addition, Mission </p><p>personnel have presented numerous demarches to various </p><p>levels of the GSL on the need to address the issue of </p><p>impunity within the security forces.  In that regard, </p><p>the security forces appear to be taking steps to </p><p>overcome a history of human rights violations and </p><p>impunity with the opening of multiple investigations </p><p>during the year.  There have also been some convictions. </p><p> </p><p>4.  INTERNATIONAL VISITORS PROGRAM (IVP):  Mission uses </p><p>IVP grants to further its MPP goals in regard to the </p><p>promotion of human rights and religious tolerance. </p><p>During the past year, for example, Mission nominated a </p><p>Sri Lankan Muslim leader to participate in an "Islam in </p><p>America" program.  Mission also nominated a number of </p><p>key individuals from human rights organizations for </p><p>programs focusing on improving organizational modalities </p><p>and how to focus on human rights-related judicial </p><p>actions. </p><p> </p><p>5.  LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE):  The LTTE is </p><p>on the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list and </p><p>Mission does not have direct contact with its members. </p><p>During the course of the year, however, Mission has </p><p>repeatedly made public statements raising concerns about </p><p>the forcible recruitment of children and the harassment </p><p>of the minority Muslim population in the east by the </p><p>LTTE.  Moreover, Mission regularly meets with Tamil </p><p>politicians and other Tamil leaders who are believed to </p><p>have contact with the LTTE.  Mission delivers consistent </p><p>messages to these interlocutors on the need for the LTTE </p><p>to stop employing violence and terrorism, stop </p><p>recruiting children, embrace pluralism, and abide by all </p><p>other international human rights standards.  Although </p><p>Mission\'s contributions were only one part of a larger </p><p>campaign by the international community aimed at </p><p>prompting responsiveness from the LTTE, at year\'s end </p><p>tensions between the Muslim community and LTTE had eased </p><p>somewhat, and the LTTE has agreed to renew its work with </p><p>UNICEF to stop child recruitment and counteract the </p><p>effects on those already recruited. </p><p> </p><p>6.  JUDICIAL REFORM:  Mission has taken the first steps </p><p>toward implementing a DRL-funded project to address </p><p>Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) cases.  The GSL has a </p><p>history of using PTA cases to arrest Tamils arbitrarily. </p><p>The PTA permitted the government to hold these </p><p>individuals in remand for an undetermined amount of </p><p>time.  Some individuals have been in custody for a </p><p>matter of years without having their cases heard in </p><p>court.  As part of the ongoing peace process, the GSL </p><p>has not arrested anyone under the PTA during the past </p><p>year and has actively begun to re-examine PTA cases. </p><p>Taking advantage of the GSL\'s newfound openness on these </p><p>cases, Mission -- using DRL funds -- has initiated the </p><p>purchasing of equipment to process the cases and is in </p><p>the final stages of helping fund attorneys for </p><p>individuals still in custody. </p><p> </p><p>7.  SPECIFIC PROJECTS:  In addition to regular contact </p><p>with GSL representatives on human rights issues, Mission </p><p>also supports individual programs focused on specific </p><p>issues.  For example, Mission has provided assistance to </p><p>the National Child Protection Authority and the Don </p><p>Boscoe Technical Center for their work in combating </p><p>trafficking in children and rehabilitating those that </p><p>have been sexually exploited.  A demining program was </p><p>also conducted to assist in permitting IDP\'s to safely </p><p>return to their home communities in Jaffna District. </p><p>Mission continues to look for opportunities to support </p><p>specific human rights programs as part of the USG\'s </p><p>promotion of human rights in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
