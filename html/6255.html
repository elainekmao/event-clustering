<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001513 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE (SILVERMAN AND GOELLNER-SWEET), NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU, IZ, AF </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH THINK TANK ALLEGES US PLANS TO REDEFINE </p><p>"MIDDLE EAST." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM RDEUTSCH, REASONS 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  ((C) SUMMARY:  ASAM, A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION PROVIDING </p><p>ADVICE AND RESEARCH TO THE TGS AND THE GOT, ASSERTS THE USG\'S </p><p>POST-IRAQ GEOPOLITICAL STRATEGY INVOLVES REDEFINING THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST REGION TO INCLUDE AFGHANISTAN.  ASAM SUPPORTS THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF AUTONOMOUS REGIONS FOR KURDS AND TURKMEN IN </p><p>POST-WAR IRAQ BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT AN IRAQ BASED ON THE </p><p>FEDERAL SYSTEM WILL SERVE AS A POTENTIAL CATALYST FOR </p><p>REGIONAL INSTABILITY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WE MET WITH UMIT OZDAG, CHAIRMAN OF THE TURKISH </p><p>CENTER FOR EURASIAN STRATEGIC STUDIES (ASAM) AT THE RESEARCH </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S HEADQUARTERS IN THE CANKAYA SECTION OF ANKARA. </p><p> THE HEADQUARTERS ARE PLUSH, SUGGESTING THAT OZDAG HAS BEEN A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL FUND-RAISER. ASAM WAS PREVIOUSLY FUNDED BY TGS. </p><p>HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ADVANCED </p><p>STRATEGY CENTER -- A THINK TANK WITH DEEP CONNECTIONS TO THE </p><p>NSC, TGS, AND INTEL SERVICES -- ASAM IS NOW SUPPORTED BY A $5 </p><p>MILLION GRANT FROM ISLAMIST TURKISH FOOD PROCESSING COMPANY </p><p>ULKER AS A WAY TO EXPAND ITS POLITICAL ACCESS TO THE </p><p>SECULARIST ESTABLISHMENT.  OZDAG SAYS ASAM PROVIDES ADVICE TO </p><p>THE TURKISH GENERAL STAFF (TGS) AND OTHER GOT ENTITIES AND HE </p><p>CLAIMED GOOD RELATIONS WITH RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS IN THE US, </p><p>ASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  HE CLAIMS NOT TO HAVE CLOSE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH INSTITUTES IN WESTERN EUROPE, ALTHOUGH HIS </p><p>GERMAN IS FLUENT FROM YEARS OF STUDY AND TEACHING IN GERMANY. </p><p> ASAM IS EMBARKING ON A NEW RESEARCH PROJECT THAT INVOLVES </p><p>HOWARD UNIVERSITY IN WASHINGTON, DC, ACCORDING TO OZDAG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>US RESHAPING GEOPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) OZDAG STATED THAT HIS AND ASAM\'S MIDDLE EAST FOCUS IS </p><p>CURRENTLY MORE IN THE US OPERATION POTENTIAL IN IRAQ.  OZDAG </p><p>BELIEVES THE US IS SEEKING TO RESHAPE THE GEOPOLITICAL </p><p>LANDSCAPE OF THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER THE IRAQ ISSUE IS RESOLVED </p><p>SO THAT AFGHANISTAN IS INCLUDED IN THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST </p><p>REGION.  IN ANTICIPATION OF THE US\'S POTENTIAL REDEFINITION </p><p>OF THE REGION, ASAM HAS ENCOURAGED THE GOT TO SUPPORT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN TO FURTHER TURKEY\'S OWN </p><p>NATIONAL INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>FEDERAL IRAQ AGAINST TURKISH NATIONAL INTERESTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>4.  (C) OZDAG ECHOES THE STANDARD OFFICIAL TURKISH LINE THAT </p><p>THE CREATION OF A FEDERAL IRAQ IS AGAINST TURKISH NATIONAL </p><p>INTERESTS.  FURTHER, OZDAG STATES THAT A FEDERAL IRAQ WOULD </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED ETHNIC TENSIONS IN TURKEY.  OZDAG </p><p>WOULD PREFER TO SEE IRAQ REORGANIZED INTO A "UNIFIED, </p><p>DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY," ESTABLISHING AUTONOMOUS REGIONS FOR BOTH </p><p>KURDS AND TURKMEN.  OZDAG ALLEGES THAT THERE ARE 2 1/2 </p><p>MILLION TURKMEN AND 4 MILLION KURDS IN IRAQ.  DENYING BOTH </p><p>KURDS AND TURKMEN AUTONOMOUS REGIONS, OZDAG ASSERTS, WOULD </p><p>VIOLATE BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>COOPERATION WITH KURDS AGAINST TURKISH INTERESTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>5.  (C) OZDAG BELIEVES THAT WASHINGTON\'S COOPERATION WITH </p><p>KURDS IS INCONSISTENT WITH TURKISH INTERESTS.  HE PREDICTS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR KURDS WILL EXTRACT ITS OWN SOCIAL PRICE IN </p><p>TURKEY, SINCE THERE ARE MANY IN TURKEY WHO WILL FOLLOW A </p><p>KURDISH "ANTI-POPE" AS A RESULT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>SHI\'A  DO NOT NEED AUTONOMY </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>6.  (C)  OZDAG DOES NOT PERCEIVE A NEED FOR AUTONOMOUS </p><p>REGIONS/STATUS FOR IRAQI SHI\'A, A MAJORITY POPULATION IN IRAQ </p><p>BUT, RATHER, THAT OTHER MINORITY GROUPS REQUIRED SPECIAL </p><p>PROTECTION FROM THE SHI\'A.  HE NOTED THAT TEL AVIV WOULD </p><p>PROBABLY OPPOSE ANY AUTONOMY FOR THE SHI\'A. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>US DOESN\'T CARE ABOUT NEW IRAQI GOVERNMENT </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>7.  (C) BELIEVING THE US DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE COMPOSITION </p><p>OF THE NEW IRAQI GOVERNMENT, OZDAG WARNS THAT ESTABLISHING A </p><p>FEDERAL IRAQ WILL PLANT THE SEEDS OF LONG-TERM REGIONAL </p><p>INSTABILITY.  ANKARA, OUT OF SELF INTEREST, WILL BE COMPELLED </p><p>TO ESTABLISH CLOSER TIES TO TEHERAN AND DAMASCUS, AS IT DID </p><p>IN THE EARLY NINETIES, HE AVERRED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  OZDAG\'S ASSERTIONS REFLECT THE MIDDLE OF </p><p>THE CURVE ON TURKISH ANALYSIS OF IRAQ, TURKISH INTERESTS AND </p><p>US POLICY.   END COMMENT. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
