Piracy of optical media remains a major issue in </p><p>Nigeria. Lack of enforcement resources and trained </p><p>enforcement staff, coupled with inadequate public and </p><p>government understanding and appreciation of the benefits </p><p>of IPR protection, make reversing this situation a </p><p>difficult, long-term effort. The Government of Nigeria </p><p>(GON)--by far the largest user of computers in the </p><p>country--is making a serious effort to see that all </p><p>government agencies use only licensed software, but it </p><p>still remains the largest user of pirated software in the </p><p>country. Meanwhile, the GON appears stalled in its </p><p>efforts to bring its IPR legislation into full compliance </p><p>with TRIPS. Admittedly, there has been little progress </p><p>over the last year, but we believe that naming Nigeria to </p><p>the Watch List is unwarranted. In fact, doing so might </p><p>make further progress on this issue considerably more </p><p>difficult. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Optical Media Piracy </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>2. Nigeria remains a large market for a wide range of </p><p>pirated optical media products. Although no formal </p><p>surveys have been conducted, Emboffs observe that nearly </p><p>all recordings offered for sale are pirated. Much of the </p><p>pirate industry is centered in one section of Lagos, </p><p>where several local optical media companies have the </p><p>capacity to produce over 500 copies of CDs, DVDs, and </p><p>VCDs daily. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The GON has slowly begun to take measures to counter </p><p>the problem. In early 2002, the Nigerian Copyrights </p><p>Commission (NCC) said it would require optical media </p><p>manufacturers to include anti-piracy devices (for </p><p>example, holograms) on their recordings. This program has </p><p>been subject to numerous delays, but the NCC announced </p><p>recently that all media would include holograms by March </p><p>2003. The NCC has no plans to require manufacturers to </p><p>include source identification codes. Nor are there plans </p><p>to enact legislation that would specifically target </p><p>optical media piracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. To date, the GON has demonstrated only tepid action </p><p>against the pirate industry, preferring, for example, to </p><p>attack videocassette rental shops rather than </p><p>manufacturers of pirated videocassettes. Coordination </p><p>among law enforcement authorities remains almost non- </p><p>existent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Use/Procurement of Government Software </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>5. While the extent of GON consumption of pirated </p><p>software is unknown, the government itself is considered </p><p>the largest abuser of IPR. Many, if not most, government </p><p>offices, utilize pirated software. In early 2002 </p><p>President Obasanjo directed all ministries and </p><p>parastatals to account for the software in their </p><p>possession, and to regularize software usage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. To that end, the President tasked the National </p><p>Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA)--in </p><p>coordination with the NCC--with auditing all software in </p><p>use by the government and negotiating license agreements </p><p>with the software owners. NITDA has faced delays in </p><p>completing the first step of the process, determining the </p><p>volume and types of software in use. NITDA promised to </p><p>provide an inter-ministerial review committee with a </p><p>report by September 2002 and then December 2002, but the </p><p>report is still pending. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Although the audit report has not been completed, </p><p>NITDA attempted to begin negotiations with at least one </p><p>software company, Microsoft. A participant in a recent </p><p>meeting between NITDA and Microsoft says that NITDA </p><p>lacked sufficient data on the government\'s use of </p><p>Microsoft products to make any headway. It is likely that </p><p>NITDA--underfunded and poorly staffed, given the enormity </p><p>of its new mandate--will continue to make similar </p><p>missteps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TRIPs Compliance </p><p>---------------- </p><p>8. Nigeria is a signatory to the Universal Copyright </p><p>Convention and the Berne Convention. In 1993, Nigeria </p><p>became a member of the World Intellectual Property </p><p>Organization (WIPO) and thereby became party to most of </p><p>the major international agreements on intellectual </p><p>property rights. The Patents and Design Decree of 1970 </p><p>governs the registration of patents; and the Standards </p><p>Organization of Nigeria is responsible for issuing </p><p>patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Once conferred, a </p><p>patent conveys an exclusive right to make, import, sell, </p><p>or use the products or apply the process. The Copyright </p><p>Decree of 1988, based on WIPO standards and U.S. </p><p>copyright law, makes it a crime to export, import, </p><p>reproduce, exhibit, perform, or sell any work without the </p><p>permission of the copyright owner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. In 1999, amendments to the Copyright Decree </p><p>incorporated most TRIPS protections for copyrights, </p><p>except provisions to protect geographical indications and </p><p>undisclosed business information. The amendment also gave </p><p>the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) additional </p><p>enforcement powers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Four TRIPS-related bills and amendments are currently </p><p>in various stages of preparation, but none have been </p><p>forwarded to the National Assembly. The World </p><p>Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has reviewed </p><p>the first three of the acts listed (all except the plant </p><p>and animal variety legislation) and, according to the </p><p>GON, determined that their enactment would bring Nigeria </p><p>into full compliance with TRIPS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The NCC and Trademarks and Patents Registry (TPR) are </p><p>preparing a bill that would merge both agencies to </p><p>establish an Intellectual Property Commission (IPCON). </p><p>The draft law also provides for the new commission to </p><p>retain a portion of the fees it collects to fund </p><p>operations and programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The Ministry of Justice is reviewing an amendment to </p><p>the Patents and Designs Act that will make comprehensive </p><p>provisions for the registration and proprietorship of </p><p>patents and designs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The Ministry of Justice is also reviewing an amendment </p><p>to the Trademarks Act that will improve existing </p><p>legislation relating to the recording, publishing, and </p><p>enforcement of trademarks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Various agencies are drafting a bill to provide </p><p>protection for plant varieties, including biotechnology, </p><p>and animal breeds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Enforcement </p><p>----------- </p><p>11. Law enforcement, particularly for patents and </p><p>trademarks, remains weak, and the judicial process is </p><p>slow and subject to corrupting influences. Inadequate </p><p>funding, lack of computerization to facilitate </p><p>enforcement, and staffing shortages contribute to </p><p>Nigeria\'s weak IPR enforcement climate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. A key deficiency remains inadequate understanding and </p><p>appreciation among regulatory officials, distributor </p><p>networks, and consumers of the benefits of intellectual </p><p>property rights protection. This is coupled with the fact </p><p>that the average consumer price of legally produced or </p><p>imported materials, particularly software, is beyond the </p><p>reach of most Nigerians. In particular, Nigeria\'s over- </p><p>stretched and under-trained police lack understanding of </p><p>IPR. The Nigerian Customs Service has received some WIPO </p><p>sponsored training, but even those officers who can </p><p>identify pirated imports are not allowed, under the </p><p>current law, to impound the offending materials unless </p><p>the copyright owner has filed a complaint against that </p><p>particular shipment, which is only done in very rare </p><p>instances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. Companies rarely seek trademark or patent protection </p><p>because it is generally perceived as ineffective. </p><p>Nonetheless, recent government efforts to curtail IPR </p><p>abuse have yielded some results. A number of high profile </p><p>actions have been taken against IPR violators. The </p><p>Nigerian Police, working closely with the NCC, have </p><p>occasionally raided enterprises allegedly producing and </p><p>selling pirated software and videos. Industry sources </p><p>indicate that the NCC has been reinvigorated to an extent </p><p>by the appointment of a new director general in July </p><p>2002, who voices a commitment to enforcement. Microsoft </p><p>reports more successful raids in 2002, including a bank </p><p>that has been charged in court, and settlements that have </p><p>resulted in the purchase of appropriate licenses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. However, most raids appear to be conducted against </p><p>small-scale pirates, and not the large, well-connected </p><p>ones. Moreover, very few cases involving copyright, </p><p>patent, or trademark infringement have been successfully </p><p>prosecuted, and most cases continue to be settled out of </p><p>court. It is unlikely that law enforcement will improve </p><p>without assertive political leadership, policy direction, </p><p>and adequate financial support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. IPR cases are handled primarily by the Federal High </p><p>Court, whose judges generally enjoy broad familiarity </p><p>with IPR protection law. However, in the lower courts, a </p><p>judge handling the case might not be knowledgeable in </p><p>IPR, and misapplication of the law is not uncommon. Lagos </p><p>is the only region in Nigeria where the majority of </p><p>judges have a reasonable knowledge of IPR. Further </p><p>exacerbating the problem, most legal practitioners do not </p><p>possess adequate knowledge of intellectual property </p><p>rights to properly handle cases. In 2002, the USG\'s Civil </p><p>Law Development Program (CLDP) continued to educate </p><p>Nigerian civil and judicial officials on IPR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Rightsholders continue to push for improved law </p><p>enforcement. Nigerian artists--including writers, </p><p>filmmakers, and musicians--have in recent years </p><p>campaigned for more effective copyright protection and </p><p>amendments to existing law. Lawyers active in IPR issues </p><p>formed the Industrial Property Law Interest Group (IPLIG) </p><p>to educate the public and lobby on behalf of industrial </p><p>IPR issues. IPLIG has sponsored several copyright </p><p>conferences and initiated an IPR course at the Lagos Law </p><p>School. Software company representatives, represented by </p><p>the Business Software Alliance (BSA), continue to work </p><p>directly with the Nigerian Government to reduce the now </p><p>high number of agencies using pirated software. Nigerian </p><p>filmmakers formed the Proteus Entertainment Agency to </p><p>challenge copyright infringement and promote stronger law </p><p>enforcement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>17. Although Nigeria is a large market for pirated goods, </p><p>it should not be included in USTR\'s Special 301 Watch </p><p>List. The GON continues to make efforts to shore up its </p><p>regulatory and legal framework. Admittedly, enforcement </p><p>remains poor, mostly due to inadequate funding but also </p><p>the result of competing priorities. Overall, though, the </p><p>GON has made a serious effort to improve IPR protection. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s effort to ensure that GON agencies use </p><p>licensed software is this year\'s best example of this </p><p>commitment. Furthermore, naming Nigeria to the Watch List </p><p>would only serve to incite latent anti-Western sentiments </p><p>in Nigeria and complicate efforts of local and foreign </p><p>rights-holders to strengthen the protection afforded </p><p>their intellectual property. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
