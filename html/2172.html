ALTHOUGH NO DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR THE 2002 </p><p>   PRESIDENTIAL POLL DUE EARLY NEXT YEAR, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA </p><p>   HAS STARTED RUNNING EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES FOCUSING ON THE </p><p>   LANDMARK PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT.  FOLLOWING ARE EXCERPTS FROM </p><p>   EDITORIALS FOCUSING ON THE DEBATE OVER PROPOSED AMENDMENTS </p><p>   TO THE ELECTORAL ACT: </p><p> </p><p>2.   UNDER HEADLINE "PREPARING THE GROUND FOR ELECTION </p><p>   FRAUD," THE NOVEMBER 12 EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT DAILY </p><p>   "THE DAILY NEWS" COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>   "THE GOVERNMENT\'S APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO </p><p>   THE ELECTORAL ACT THAT ENTAILS CHANGING REGULATIONS ON </p><p>   POSTAL VOTING, CAMPAIGNING, POLLING AND ON THE VOTER\'S </p><p>   ROLL ITSELF. . .IS BOTH REGRETTABLE AND DISHEARTENING. </p><p>   REGRETTABLE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT, ARROGANT AS ALWAYS, </p><p>   DECIDED ON THOSE AMENDMENTS ALONE WITHOUT CONSULTING </p><p>   OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FOR CONSENSUS.  THIS MAKES THE </p><p>   AMENDMENTS A PARTISAN AFFAIR CLEARLY MEANT TO MAKE IT </p><p>   EASIER FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO MANIPULATE THE BALLOT IN </p><p>   FAVOR OF ZANU PF. . .   DISHEARTENING BECAUSE THE </p><p>   AMENDMENTS ARE CLEARLY A SELF-SERVING MOVE DESIGNED TO </p><p>   MAKE ALL OTHER ASPIRING CONTESTANTS IN THE NEXT AND </p><p>   SUBSEQUENT ELECTIONS LOSE ALL HOPE OF WINNING AS THE </p><p>   CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THE AMENDMENTS IS TO RENDER THE </p><p>   POLITICAL PLAYING FIELD IN ZIMBABWE MUCH MORE UNEVEN </p><p>   THAN IT HAD BEEN HITHERTO.  OVER AND ABOVE THE PHYSICAL </p><p>   DANGERS THOSE WHO BRAVE STANDING AGAINST ZANU PF </p><p>   CANDIDATES FACE BECAUSE OF THE EVER-PRESENT VIOLENCE THE </p><p>   PARTY ALWAYS UNLEASHES AGAINST THOSE WHO OPPOSE IT, THE </p><p>   AMENDMENTS MAKE CONTEST BY ANYONE OUTSIDE ZANU PF A </p><p>   COSTLY, FUTILE EXERCISE. . .

UNDER HEADLINE "WE CAN HANDLE ELECTIONS ON OUR OWN," </p><p>   THE NOVEMBER 9 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED </p><p>   WEEKLY "THE MANICA POST" COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>   "A PROPOSAL BY THE GOVERNMENT TO AMEND THE ELECTORAL ACT </p><p>   TO GIVE POWERS TO THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION </p><p>   (ESC) TO RECRUIT, TRAIN AND DEPLOY ELECTION MONITORS IN </p><p>   ALL ELECTIONS, BE THEY PRESIDENTIAL OR PARLIAMENTARY BY- </p><p>   ELECTIONS, SHOULD BE WELCOMED BY EVERYONE WHO IS PROUD </p><p>   TO BE ZIMBABWEAN. . .  PREVIOUSLY THE ESC HAS RELIED ON </p><p>   MONITORS TRAINED BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, AN </p><p>   UNHEALTHY SITUATION CONSIDERING THAT THE SUPERVISORY </p><p>   BODY WAS NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THEIR TRAINING.  THIS </p><p>   PUT ESC IN AN AWKWARD POSITION.  HOW, FOR INSTANCE, </p><p>   COULD IT BE IN CHARGE OF PEOPLE WHOSE TRAINING IT HAD </p><p>   LITTLE TO DO WITH?  ON THE OTHER HAND, HOW MUCH CAN THE </p><p>   NGOS BE TRUSTED TO TRAIN ELECTION MONITORS WHEN SOME OF </p><p>   THEM ARE KNOWN TO BE HOSTILE TO THE ZANU PF GOVERNMENT? </p><p>   . . .IT IS HIGH TIME THE OPPOSITION IS DISABUSED OF THE </p><p>   NOTION THAT ZIMBABWEANS CANNOT HANDLE THEIR OWN AFFAIRS. </p><p>   . . ." </p><p> </p><p>4.
