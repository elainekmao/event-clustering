<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 003636 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PREL, VT, VTPGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: THE LIMITS OF VATICAN PERSUASION ON BISHOPS\' </p><p>POLITICAL VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2001 VATICAN 0196 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: DESPITE THE PERCEPTION OF THE HOLY SEE AS </p><p>A HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION, IT RARELY GIVES "MARCHING </p><p>ORDERS" TO CATHOLIC BISHOPS ON SECULAR POLITICAL MATTERS. </p><p>IN THE RARE CASES WHEN IT DOES DECIDE TO PRESS ITS POLITICAL </p><p>VIEWS, IT IS LARGELY LIMITED TO THE POWER OF PAPAL </p><p>PERSUASION - WHICH IS COMPELLING, BUT NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03636  01 OF 02  231501Z </p><p>CHANGE BISHOPS\' INDIVIDUAL CONVICTIONS.  THE POPE\'S VIEWS ON </p><p>POLITICAL MATTERS ARE CONVEYED BY THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE </p><p>THROUGH THE LOCAL NUNCIO.  HOWEVER, THE HOLY SEE GENERALLY </p><p>SEEKS TO AVOID PUBLIC DISPUTES, BOTH TO PRESERVE THE UNITY </p><p>OF THE CHURCH AND TO PROTECT THE PHYSICAL SECURITY OF ITS </p><p>ADHERENTS IN COUNTRIES WHERE CATHOLICS ARE A THREATENED </p><p>MINORITY.  WHEN LOCAL BISHOPS\' VIEWS RUN COUNTER TO U.S. </p><p>INTERESTS, DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE RESIDENT NUNCIO AND THE </p><p>BISHOPS THEMSELVES OFFER THE BEST MEANS TO ADDRESS ISSUES. </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN WOULD ALSO BE PREPARED TO RAISE ISSUES OF </p><p>PRIORITY INTEREST WITH THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>BISHOPS AND POLITICS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) EMBASSY VATICAN OCCASIONALLY RECEIVES QUERIES FROM </p><p>POSTS AS TO WHETHER THE HOLY SEE MIGHT INTERVENE TO CHANGE </p><p>THE POLITICAL BEHAVIOR OF A BISHOP.  RECENT INQUIRIES, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, HAVE FOCUSED ON HARD LINE CROAT-NATIONALIST CLERGY </p><p>IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AND BISHOPS\' LETTERS </p><p>SEEMING TO SUPPORT BASQUE SEPARATISM.  IN THE PAST, BISHOPS\' </p><p>SUPPORT FOR LIBERATION THEOLOGY IN CENTRAL AMERICA OR </p><p>REPRESSIVE REGIMES IN THE SOUTHERN CONE OF LATIN AMERICA </p><p>HAVE EVOKED CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND CRITICISM. </p><p>UNLIKE OTHER GOVERNMENTS WE MIGHT APPROACH TO REIN IN AN </p><p>OFFICIAL, THE HOLY SEE IS CONSTRAINED ON POLITICAL ISSUES </p><p>(UNLIKE ISSUES OF CHURCH DOCTRINE) BY CHURCH STRUCTURES AND </p><p>TRADITIONS FROM COMPELLING ADHERENCE TO VIEWS FAVORED BY THE </p><p>CURIA. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03636  01 OF 02  231501Z </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>THE LIMITS TO PAPAL PERSUASION </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE HOLY SEE HAS LIMITED OPTIONS FOR INFLUENCING </p><p>LOCAL BISHOPS\' POLITICAL VIEWS.  USUALLY IT RELIES ON THE </p><p>POWER OF PERSUASION VIA THE LOCAL NUNCIO.  A BISHOP IS </p><p>BROADLY AUTONOMOUS IN HIS DIOCESE, HOWEVER, AS THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH FOLLOWS THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY -- THE </p><p>REQUIREMENT THAT LOCAL ELEMENTS OF THE CHURCH MANAGE THEIR </p><p>OWN AFFAIRS.  THE HOLY SEE MAY INVOKE THE FEALTY OF A BISHOP </p><p>TO HIS POPE, BUT IT HAS LIMITED DISCIPLINARY RECOURSE IN THE </p><p>EVENT THE BISHOP REFUSES TO ALTER OR TONE DOWN HIS VIEWS. </p><p>WERE THE POPE TO ATTEMPT TO REPLACE OR RECALL THE BISHOP ON </p><p>THE BASIS OF POLITICAL VIEWS AGAINST THE WILL OF HIS FLOCK, </p><p>HE WOULD RISK PROVOKING A SCHISM, WITH NO GUARANTEE THAT THE </p><p>POPE\'S VIEWS WOULD PREVAIL.  THE VATICAN SEEKS TO AVOID SUCH </p><p>AN INJURY TO THE "FAMILY" OF THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH AT ALMOST </p><p>ANY COST. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) IN RECENT HISTORY, THE POPE HAS EXCOMMUNICATED A </p><p>BISHOP ONLY FOR DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCES, NOT POLITICAL ONES. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1988 ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE FRENCH PRELATE, </p><p>MARCEL LEFEBVRE WAS EXCOMMUNICATED "AUTOMATICALLY" FOR </p><p>ORDAINING NEW BISHOPS FOR HIS BREAK-AWAY GROUP OF CATHOLICS </p><p>WITHOUT THE REQUIRED PERMISSION OF THE POPE.  ANOTHER </p><p>EXAMPLE OF CHURCH DISCIPLINE WAS THE BREAKUP OF THE SAO </p><p>PAOLO DIOCESE IN 1989 INTO FOUR SEPARATE DIOCESES.  THE POPE </p><p>AND HIS CURIA UNILATERALLY DECLARED THE BREAKUP AND </p><p>INSTALLATION OF THREE ADDITIONAL (AND MORE CONSERVATIVE) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03636  01 OF 02  231501Z </p><p>BISHOPS WHEN ARCHBISHOP OF SAO PAOLO EVARISTO ARNS REFUSED </p><p>TO BACK DOWN FROM HIS STRONG SUPPORT FOR LIBERATION </p><p>THEOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  MORE FREQUENTLY, THE VATICAN HAS HAD LIMITED </p><p>ABILITY IN CHANGING POLITICAL POSITIONS OF ITS BISHOPS.  IN </p><p>2001, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CROATIAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE\'S PUBLIC </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED AND REFORM-ORIENTED </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF STIPE MESIC, PRESENTED A THREAT TO THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S BROADER INTEREST IN REGIONAL RECONCILIATION AND </p><p>STABILITY.  THE NUNCIO IN ZAGREB WAS CHARGED WITH CONVEYING </p><p>THE HOLY SEE\'S "CEASE AND DESIST" ORDER TO THE CROATIAN </p><p>BISHOPS.  WHEN THAT DIDN\'T CHANGE THE LATTER\'S ANTI- </p><p>GOVERNMENT COMMENTARY, THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE DISPATCHED </p><p>FM EQUIVALENT ARCHBISHOP TAURAN TO ZAGREB TO PRESS THE </p><p>POINT.  TAURAN LEFT A PRO MEMORIA WITH THE CROATIAN BISHOPS </p><p>-- AN ESPECIALLY STRONG INDICATION OF THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>INTEREST IN THE ISSUE (REFTEL). THE POPE, HOWEVER, DID NOT </p><p>PUBLICLY CENSURE THE LOCAL BISHOPS.  THAT HE DIDN\'T </p><p>UNDERSCORES THE PRIMARY INTEREST IN PROTECTING THE OUTWARD </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4215 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03636  02 OF 02  231502Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   NSAE-00  TEST-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------CF179B  231503Z /38 </p><p>R 231500Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 003636 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

(SBU) COMMENT:  WHEN CONFRONTED WITH A BISHOP WHOSE VIEWS </p><p>GO AGAINST THE GRAIN OF THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS ON SECULAR </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUES, THE HOLY SEE WILL ALWAYS ASSESS ITS OWN </p><p>BIG PICTURE OF FAITH, MORALS, DOCTRINE AND THE WELL-BEING OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03636  02 OF 02  231502Z </p><p>ITS FAITHFUL IN JUDGING WHETHER AND HOW TO INTERVENE.  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE WILL ALMOST ALWAYS CHOOSE TO ACT BEHIND THE SCENES, </p><p>APPROACHING AN OUTSPOKEN BISHOP THROUGH HIS COLLEAGUES IN </p><p>THE LOCAL BISHOPS\' CONFERENCE AND/OR THE LOCAL NUNCIO.  IN </p><p>CASES WHERE BISHOPS OF OTHER CHURCH REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>ARTICULATE VIEWS SEEN AS DAMAGING TO U.S. INTERESTS, </p><p>EMBASSIES SHOULD SEEK TO DEVELOP GOOD AVENUES OF </p><p>COMMUNICATION WITH THE RESIDENT NUNCIO AND THE NATIONAL </p><p>BISHOPS THEMSELVES.  EMBASSY VATICAN WOULD ALSO BE PREPARED </p><p>TO APPROACH THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE AT THE HOLY SEE AND TO </p><p>ADVISE POSTS ON HOW BEST TO ADVANCE U.S. VIEWS IN THE FACE </p><p>OF OUTSPOKEN OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL BISHOPS. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA03636 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
