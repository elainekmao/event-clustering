(C) SUMMARY: AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR, </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S BUDGET AND GDP OUTLOOK LOOKS TO FALL FAR SHORT OF THE </p><p>PROJECTIONS MADE IN THE "MILLENIUM BUDGET," RELEASED LATE LAST YEAR. </p><p>AT THE TIME THE BUDGET WAS MADE PUBLIC, BOTH WE AND LOCAL ANALYSTS </p><p>ASSERTED THAT ITS PREDICTIONS ON BOTH THE SIZE OF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>DEFICIT AND THE PROJECTED GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) WERE OVERLY </p><p>OPTIMISTIC, IF NOT OUTRIGHTLY UNATTAINABLE (REFTEL A).  RESULTS AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS ARE INDICATING THAT EVEN THE </p><p>MOST PESSIMISTIC COMMENTATORS, INCLUDING US, WERE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC. </p><p>LOW EXPORT PRICES, HIGH DOMESTIC INFLATION, THE PEGGED EXCHANGE RATE </p><p>AND RESULTANT HARD CURRENCY SHORTAGE, COMPOUNDED BY SHOCKS SUCH AS </p><p>THE FUEL SHORTAGE AND THE FARM INVASIONS, CAUSE US TO NOW ESTIMATE </p><p>THAT GDP MAY ONLY TOTAL ZIM $230 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY U.S. $6.1 </p><p>BILLION), OR ABOUT 88 PERCENT OF THE GOVERNMENT FORECAST. </p><p>PROFLIGRATE SPENDING, INCLUDING VERY LARGE, UNBUDGETED-FOR SALARY </p><p>INCREASES GRANTED BY THE PRESIDENT WITH AN EYE ON THE ELECTIONS, </p><p>INTEREST COSTS AVERAGING 65 PERCENT (ON GOVERNMENT BORROWINGS), AND </p><p>NO PROGRESS ON SAVINGS MEASURES MAKE IT CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT THE </p><p>DEFICIT TARGET WILL BE GROSSLY OVERSHOT.  THE NET RESULT IS AN </p><p>ESTIMATE THAT THIS YEAR\'S DEFICIT MAY EASILY AMOUNT TO 18 TO 20 </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP.  SUCH A SHORTFALL WILL HAVE SERIOUS NEGATIVE FORWARD </p><p>CONSEQUENCES THAT INCLUDE CONTINUING HIGH INFLATION, STIFLED OR </p><p>NEGATIVE REAL GDP GROWTH, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FUNDING SUPPORT.  UNLESS AGGRESSIVE MEASURES IN A REVERSE DIRECTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02081  01 OF 02  140811Z </p><p>ARE TAKEN AFTER THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS, THE RESULTS COULD WORSEN. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>THE SIZE, AND COMPONENTS, OF THE DEFICIT </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN THE BUDGET ANNOUNCED BY THE FINANCE MINISTER ON OCTOBER </p><p>21 LAST YEAR, THE GOZ DEFICIT FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR WAS PEGGED AT </p><p>ZIMBABWE $9.9 BILLION (ABOUT U.S. $264 MILLION AT CURRENT RATES), OR </p><p>ABOUT 3.9 PERCENT OF GDP.  GDP ITSELF WAS FORECAST BY THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTRY TO BE ZIM $260 BILLION (ABOUT U.S. $6.9 BILLION AT CURRENT </p><p>RATES).  LOCAL ECONOMIC ANALYSTS AND COMMENTATORS AT THE TIME </p><p>REVISED THE DEFICIT UP TO $15 BILLION (PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE </p><p>REALISTIC INTEREST COST ASSUMPTIONS) AND THE PROJECTED GDP DOWN TO </p><p>$250 BILLION, FOR A PRO FORMA DEFICIT OF ABOUT 6 PERCENT OF GDP. </p><p>WHILE NOT HEALTHY OR SUSTAINABLE (AND ABOUT DOUBLE THE IMF\'S 2.8 </p><p>PERCENT TARGET), SUCH A RESULT WOULD BE FAR BETTER THAN THE DOUBLE- </p><p>DIGIT DEFICIT FIGURE EMERGING FOR 1999.  HOWEVER, EVEN BEFORE THE </p><p>FIRST DAY OF THE NEW MILLENIUM IT BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT </p><p>EITHER TARGET WAS A CHIMERA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FIRST, THE GOVERNMENT EMBARKED ON A MASSIVE UNBUDGETED-FOR </p><p>SPENDING SPREE, WHICH WAS CLEARLY A VOTE-BUYING EXERCISE.  IT HIKED </p><p>CIVIL SERVICE SALARIES BETWEEN 69 AND 80 PERCENT, WHILE ALSO JACKING </p><p>UP HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION ALLOWANCES BY 178 PERCENT.  (THE 1999 </p><p>BUDGET CONTAINED ONLY A 30 PERCENT ACROSS-THE-BOARD INCREASE FOR ALL </p><p>DRAWING A GOVERNMENT WAGE.)  IT GRANTED THE CABINET AND MEMBERS OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT SALARY AND ALLOWANCE INCREASES OF BETWEEN 200 AND 300 </p><p>PERCENT, BACKDATED TO JULY 1999.  THE DEFENSE FORCES HAD THEIR </p><p>SALARIES DOUBLED, AND TRADITIONAL HEADMEN AND CHIEFS SAW THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02081  01 OF 02  140811Z </p><p>MONTHLY PAYOUT SWELL BY UP TO 400 PERCENT.  NOT TO BE LEFT OUT, THE </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY WAR VETERAN\'S PENSIONS WERE RAISED BY ABOUT </p><p>50 PERCENT (REFTELS B & C).  HOWEVER, A CERTAIN SECTOR MISSED OUT ON </p><p>THE LARGESSE; THE JUDICIARY GOT NARY A SINGLE DIGIT INCREASE OR </p><p>ALLOWANCE HIKE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT\'S 2000 BUDGET ALSO MADE UNREALISTIC </p><p>PROJECTIONS OF AVERAGE INFLATION AND INTEREST COSTS.  INFLATION (NOW </p><p>AT ABOUT 50 PERCENT AND GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE ON THE THRESHOLD OF </p><p>RISING DUE TO DEVALUATION) WAS FORECAST TO BE 30 PERCENT AT MID- </p><p>YEAR, DECLINING TO 15 PERCENT AT YEAR-END.  BECAUSE THIS WILL NOT BE </p><p>THE CASE, EVERY COST LINE IN THE BUDGET IS UNDERSTATED, AND WITH </p><p>HIGHER REAL OPERATING COSTS, THE DEFICIT WILL SWELL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE COST OF SERVICING THE GOVERNMENT\'S DEBT IS A VIVID </p><p>EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS BLOWING OUT THE BUDGET.  IN THE FY 2000 BUDGET, </p><p>INTEREST COSTS ARE SCHEDULED TO RISE IN NOMINAL TERMS FROM 1999\'S </p><p>ZIM $21 BILLION, TO ZIM $28 BILLION (ABOUT U.S. $375 MILLION), AND </p><p>COMPRISE ABOUT 30 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BUDGET.  THE COSTS ARE BASED </p><p>ON AN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE BELOW 30 PERCENT, AND A TOTAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>DEBT OF ABOUT ZIM $160 BILLION (SPLIT INTO $95 BILLION FOREIGN AND </p><p>$65 BILLION DOMESTIC).  HOWEVER, SOURCES WITHIN GOVERNMENT HAVE </p><p>INDICATED TO US THAT TOTAL GOZ BORROWINGS (INCLUDING PARASTATAL </p><p>COMMITMENTS AND ARREARS) NOW APPROXIMATE ZIM $270 BILLION (OR OVER A </p><p>YEAR\'S GDP).  THIS TOTAL IS SPLIT INTO FOREIGN DEBT OF $150 BILLION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5392 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02081  02 OF 02  140811Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  VC-01    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------4BAD42  140812Z /38 </p><p>R 140816Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5757 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002081 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND GRACE SONE </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/13/10 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S 2000 BUDGET AND GDP OUTLOOK IS BLEAK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02081  02 OF 02  140811Z </p><p> </p><p>AND DOMESTIC DEBT OF $120 BILLION, INCLUSIVE OF MORE THAN $80 </p><p>BILLION IN TREASURY BILLS AND A RESERVE BANK OVERDRAFT OF OVER $7 </p><p>BILLION.  THE LATTER EXISTS DESPITE A PLEDGE TO THE IMF MADE IN THE </p><p>FALL OF 1999 TO ELIMINATE GOZ CHECK KITING, AND THE OVERDRAFT </p><p>THEREBY CREATED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WITH GOVERNMENT INTEREST RATES CURRENTLY EXCEEDING 65 </p><p>PERCENT, AND LITTLE DOWNWARD MOVEMENT EXPECTED FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT </p><p>QUARTER, THE CONUNDRUM BECOMES EVIDENT.  IF ONE ANNUALIZES THE </p><p>DOMESTIC DEBT SERVICING COST AT, SAY, AN INTEREST RATE OF 50 </p><p>PERCENT, THE INTEREST CHARGE COMES TO $60 BILLION, OR $32 BILLION </p><p>MORE THAN THE AMOUNT BUDGETED FOR TOTAL INTEREST COSTS ($28 </p><p>BILLION), ON BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN DEBT.  OF COURSE ANY </p><p>DEVALUATION OF THE CURRENCY WILL SWELL THE $95 BILLION OF FOREIGN </p><p>BORROWING BY A PROPORTIONAL AMOUNT, AND MAKE THE DEBT SERVICE COSTS </p><p>COMMENSURATELY MORE EXPENSIVE. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>PROJECTED GDP </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT\'S FY 2000 BUDGET PROJECTED A GDP OF $260 </p><p>BILLION.  THE ESTIMATE CONTAINS ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS REAL GROWTH IN </p><p>THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR OF 4.9 PERCENT.  IT DOES NOT FACTOR IN </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION LOSSES DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, FARM INVASIONS </p><p>(ALL CROPS), CYCLONE ELINE (TIMBER, TEA AND COFFEE), EXCESS RAINFALL </p><p>IN SOME AREAS (MAIZE AND COTTON), OR THE FUEL SHORTAGE (ALL CROPS). </p><p>IN ADDITION, MINING AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION CONTINUE TO DECLINE, </p><p>DUE PRIMARILY TO CONTINUED HIGH INTEREST COSTS AND HIGH INFLATION, </p><p>THE FUEL SHORTAGE, AND A LACK OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TO IMPORT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02081  02 OF 02  140811Z </p><p>NECESSARY INPUTS OR EQUIPMENT.  SIMILARLY, RETAIL SALES IN ALL AREAS </p><p>ARE DOWN, AND TOURISM BOOKINGS ARE OFF DUE TO PRESS REPORTS OF THE </p><p>FUEL SHORTAGE, FARM INVASIONS AND DOMESTIC POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  FOR </p><p>THESE CUMULATIVE REASONS WE FORECAST THAT GDP MAY VERY LIKELY BE, AT </p><p>BEST, ABOUT ZIM $230 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY U.S. $6.1 BILLION). </p><p>CALCULATING WITH THE UPWARDLY REVISED GOVERNMENT DEFICIT PROJECTION </p><p>AND THE DOWNWARDLY ADJUSTED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TOTAL (OR GDP), THE </p><p>RESULT IS THE DISMAL 20 PERCENT OF GDP DEFICIT ESTIMATE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED (REFTELS C & D), ZIMBABWE IS FACING </p><p>SEVERE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT ARE GETTING WORSE WITH TIME.  A DELAY </p><p>WILL ONLY INCREASE THE COST AND EFFORT REQUIRED TO GET BACK TO WHERE </p><p>THE COUNTRY WAS ONLY A YEAR OR TWO AGO.  ZIMBABWE RETAINS </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, BOTH HUMAN AND ECONOMIC, WHICH IT CAN CALL ON </p><p>TO REVERSE THE SLIDE, BUTTRESSED BY THE TOP-CLASS AND DEMONSTRATED </p><p>RESILIENCY OF ITS INDUSTRY AND PRIVATE SECTOR.  HOWEVER, THIS ACTION </p><p>MUST COME SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, AND THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTIONS </p><p>IS OUR RECOMMENDED, LATEST, START DATE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
