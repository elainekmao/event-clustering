<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 000679 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, HR, IZ, UNCHR-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: UNCHR/CROATIA:  CROATIA WILL OPPOSE </p><p>SPECIAL SITTING; UN ROLE IN POST WAR IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 76558 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: LAWRENCE G ROSSIN,AMBASSADOR FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE GOC WILL VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL FOR A </p><p>SPECIAL SITTING ON THE IRAQ CONFLICT, "AS IT IS CURRENTLY </p><p>FRAMED AND GIVEN THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE COMMISSION."  HOWEVER, </p><p>    DEPUTY FM SIMONOVIC TOLD AMBASSADOR IN CONVEYING THIS </p><p>POSITION THAT THE SITUATION AT THE UNCHR IS "FLUID" AND THE </p><p>GOC MIGHT RECONSIDER IF THE PROPOSAL EVOLVED POSITIVELY AND </p><p>PARTICULARLY IF THE EU SWUNG IN BEHIND IT.  THIS DECISION WAS </p><p>TAKEN AT THE HIGHEST GOC LEVEL.  OBVIOUSLY, USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>WILL NEED TO WATCH THE CROATIANS CAREFULLY; THEY UNDOUBTEDLY </p><p>WILL ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH ANY EU POSITION THAT EMERGES. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AMBASSADOR DELIVERED REF A DEMARCHE TO DEPUTY FM </p><p>SIMONOVIC EARLY MARCH 25.  IN ADDITION TO PREVIOUS POINTS, </p><p>AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED HIS VIEW THAT A GOC SHIFT FROM "ABSTAIN" </p><p>TO "NO" WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE MUTUAL DESIRE OF PM </p><p>RACAN AND THE AMBASSADOR TO CIRCUMSCRIBE OUR DIFFERENCES OVER </p><p>IRAQ AND FIND COMMON GROUND, PER THEIR MARCH 24 MEETING. </p><p>GIVEN OUR COMMON INTEREST IN REBUILDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF </p><p>THE UN SYSTEM AND FOCUSING THE WORK OF THE UNCHR ON REAL </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, THIS SEEMED AN APPROPRIATE AREA FOR GOC </p><p>SUPPORT.  IT WAS NO ACCIDENT THAT COUNTRIES LIKE CUBA, LIBYA </p><p>AND ZIMBABWE WERE PUSHING THIS; APART FROM BECOMING AN </p><p>ANTI-AMERICAN CIRCUS, IT WOULD EAT UP TIME OTHERWISE </p><p>AVAILABLE TO EXAMINE THEIR ABUSES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SIMONOVIC SAID HE HAD SPOKEN TO PM RACAN BEFORE THE </p><p>MEETING AND WOULD SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN AFTERWARD.  PERSONALLY, </p><p>HE SEEMED TO FIND MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS APPEALING, BUT HE </p><p>SAID HE COULD ONLY PROVIDE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER AFTER </p><p>CONSULTING HIS SUPERIORS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SIMONOVIC APPEARED GENERALLY AWARE OF THE CONTENT OF </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR\'S DISCUSSION WITH PM RACAN MARCH 24.  HE </p><p>    AFFIRMED A GOC DESIRE TO END PUBLIC CONTROVERSY ABOUT OUR </p><p>DIVERGENT POLITICAL POSITIONS ON IRAQ AND TO FOCUS ON </p><p>CROATIA\'S SUPPORT FOR THE GWOT AND WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>IN POST-CONFLICT ACTIVITY IN IRAQ AS WELL AS ON THE FUTURE </p><p>ROLE OF THE UN IN IRAQ AND IN MAINTAINING A STABLE WORLD </p><p>ORDER.  UN INVOLVEMENT IN POST-WAR IRAQ WOULD CONSTITUTE "THE </p><p>FIRST PHASE FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE UN."  HE ASKED IF THE USG </p><p>HAD DEVELOPED A POLICY OR FRAMEWORK FOR THE ROLE OF THE UN </p><p>VIS-A-VIS IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THE PRESIDENT\'S AND SECRETARY\'S </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF DESIRE THAT THE UNITED NATIONS PLAY A </p><p>LEADING ROLE IN POST-CONFLICT IRAQ.  IN THAT REGARD, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED WITH DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THOSE COUNTRIES </p><p>THAT HAD OPPOSED THE UNSCR IN THE UNSC SEEMED NOW TO BE </p><p>BLOCKING AMENDMENT OF THE OIL-FOR-PEACE ARRANGEMENT TO </p><p>BENEFIT THE IRAQI PEOPLE, AND CRITICIZING THE IDEA OF A NEW </p><p>UNSCR FOR POST-CONFLICT ACTIVITY.  THEIR APPARENT FOCUS WAS </p><p>PERPETUATING THE PREVIOUS UNSC DEBATE, NOW ENDED.  SUCH </p><p>DWELLING ON THE PAST WOULD NOT ENHANCE THE REVITALIZATION OF </p><p>THE UN SYSTEM THAT WE AND THE GOC SEEK.  SIMONOVIC, CROATIA\'S </p><p>FORMER UN PERMREP, NODDED IN AGREEMENT.  HE SAID HE HAD </p><p>WRITTEN AN OP-ED (TO BE PUBLISHED IN A ZAGREB PAPER MARCH 26) </p><p>CALLING FOR UN REFORM AND GREATER WEIGHT IN THE UN FOR THE </p><p>MORE CAPABLE MEMBER STATES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: WHILE SIMONOVIC SAID A LOT POSITIVE, THE FACT </p><p>THAT IT TOOK HIM ALL DAY TO GET US AN ANSWER TO OUR UNCHR </p><p>DEMARCHE, AND THAT THE ANSWER WAS SO CAREFULLY HEDGED, </p><p>INDICATES THAT CROATIA WILL NOT BE PROMINENT IN WORKING FOR </p><p>THE SORT OF UN REFORM HE ADVOCATED. </p><p>    ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
