(SBU) ON MAY 21, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER SIMONIC TO DISCUSS CROATIA\'S DESIGNATION ON THE </p><p>SPECIAL 301 WATCH LIST FOR FAILING TO PROTECT U.S. </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  SIMONIC IS IN CHARGE OF HEALTH AND </p><p>MINORITY ISSUES.  SIMONIC ACKNOWLEDGED THE OBLIGATION CROATIA </p><p>HAD TO RATIFY THE BILATERAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MOU, AND </p><p>SAID A KEY GOAL WAS TO PASS THE DRAFT DRUG LAW, WHICH </p><p>CURRENTLY INCLUDES LANGUAGE ON DATA EXCLUSIVITY.  SUBSEQUENT </p><p>NEWS ITEMS QUOTED SIMONIC AS WILLING TO TRY TO PRESS THE </p><p>CABINET TO SEND THE MOU TO THE PARLIAMENT FOR RATIFICATION, </p><p>BUT MINISTER OF HEALTH VLAHUSIC WAS SQUARELY AGAINST </p><p>RATIFYING THE MOU.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01187  01 OF 02  271602Z </p><p>2.  (SBU) ON MAY 21, THE AMBASSADOR REVIEWED FOR DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER SIMONIC THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE 1998 INTELLECTUAL </p><p>PROPERTY MOU WAS SIGNED.  THE U.S. NEGOTIATED THE MOU IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF SUPPORTING CROATIA\'S BID TO JOIN THE WTO AND IN </p><p>CONJUNCTION WITH A BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY (BIT). </p><p>CROATIA WAS NOW A MEMBER OF THE WTO, THE BIT WAS IN FORCE, </p><p>AND THE MOU WAS STALLED, DESPITES YEARS OF DISCUSSIONS, BOTH </p><p>IN WASHINGTON AND IN ZAGREB.  HE WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT </p><p>GOC FAILURE TO ACT HAD ALLOWED CROATIA TO "DRIFT" ONTO THE </p><p>WATCH LIST.  WHILE OUR GOAL WAS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, THE 301 </p><p>PROCESS DID CONTAIN MECHANISMS THAT COULD WELL LEAD TO TRADE </p><p>SANCTIONS DOWN THE ROAD IF THE GOC DID NOT ACT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED APPROVINGLY THE NEWS THAT THE </p><p>LATEST ITERATION OF THE DRAFT PHARMACEUTICAL LAW CONTAINED </p><p>LANGUAGE ON DATA EXCLUSIVITY DRAWN FROM THE EU MODEL.  (THE </p><p>LANGUAGE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE DRAFT AT LEAST ONCE </p><p>BEFORE.)  HE HOPED THAT DATA EXCLUSIVITY WOULD REMAIN IN THE </p><p>LEGISLATION, BE ENACTED AND IMPLEMENTED SOON. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) SIMONIC REMARKED THAT HE WAS RELATIVELY NEW IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  ONE OF HIS AND HIS PARTY\'S (HSS -- CROATIAN </p><p>PEASANT\'S PARTY) MAIN PRIORITIES WAS TO PASS A NEW DRUG LAW. </p><p>UPON ENTERING THE GOVERNMENT, HE LEARNED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF </p><p>THE MOU.  SIMONIC CONCLUDED THAT THE GOC HAD AN OBLIGATION TO </p><p>THE U.S. TO RATIFY THE MOU.  CROATIA ALSO HAD TO FOLLOW </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RULES, SUCH AS THOSE OF THE WTO, STABILITY PACT </p><p>AND THE EU.  HE WAS NOT AN ECONOMIST, AND ADMITTED THAT HE </p><p>HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN DATA ON WHAT THE EFFECT WOULD BE </p><p>ON THE CROATIAN HEALTH SYSTEM OR ON CROATIAN COMPANIES OF </p><p>INTRODUCING DATA EXCLUSIVITY.  SIMONIC SAID HE WAS PUSHING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01187  01 OF 02  271602Z </p><p>FOR THE DRUG LAW, WHICH WAS IMPORTANT FOR CROATIA AND HIS </p><p>PARTY, AND HE BELIEVED THE MOU WOULD BE RATIFIED AS WELL. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE WARNED, THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>COMMENT ON THE DRAFT LEGISLATION.  SIMONIC FLAGGED THE MOU\'S </p><p>PROVISION FOR PIPELINE PROTECTION OF DRUGS AS A CONCERN AS </p><p>WELL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR THANKED SIMONIC FOR HIS RECOGNITION </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S OBLIGATION TO RATIFY THE MOU.  WHILE ANY </p><p>COUNTRY COULD EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN RATIFICATION, WHAT HAD </p><p>BEEN OF CONCERN IN CROATIA WAS THE LACK OF EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITMENT TO PUSH FOR RATIFICATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) THE MEDIA COVERED THE VISIT FAIRLY EXTENSIVELY, AND </p><p>FOR THE FIRST TIME REPORTED ON THE 301 ANNOUNCEMENT. </p><p>(SIMONIC HAD ARRANGED AN UNUSUAL POOL SPRAY AT THE TOP OF THE </p><p>MEETING).  AFTER THE MEETING, SIMONIC TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK HARD TO GET CROATIA OFF THE WATCH LIST, </p><p>AND SAID HE WOULD PRESS FOR MOU RATIFICATION WITHIN THE </p><p>CABINET.  HE NOTED THAT WHILE CROATIA WAS ON A LIST WITH </p><p>COUNTRIES SUCH AS PAKISTAN AND JAMAICA (PRESUMABLY NOT A GOOD </p><p>THING), THERE WERE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SUCH AS ITALY ON </p><p>THE LIST AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) THE MEDIA ALSO INTERVIEWED MINISTER OF HEALTH </p><p>VLAHUSIC, WHO WAS LESS FORTHCOMING.

IN ANOTHER PRINT INTERVIEW, HE IS QUOTED </p><p>AS SAYING THAT "WITH THE NEW LAW ON DRUGS, AND BY JOINING THE </p><p>WTO, CROATIA HAS ACCEPTED EVERYTHING THAT RELATES TO THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY... THE U.S. IS ASKING </p><p>CROATIA TO SIGN SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN SIGNED BY </p><p>SOME EU MEMBERS." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) WE HAVE HEARD FROM INDUSTRY SOURCES THAT VLAHUSIC </p><p>MAY PLAN TO SUGGEST AMENDMENTS TO THE DRAFT DRUG LAW THAT </p><p>WOULD DELAY IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL EU ACCESSION.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SENT A LETTER MAY 21 TO MINISTER VLAHUSIC, SHORTLY </p><p>BEFORE THE MEETING WITH DPM SIMONIC (TEXT EMAILED TO USTR, EB </p><p>AND THE DESK), URGING SPEEDY RATIFICATION OF THE BILATERAL IP </p><p>MOU. </p><p> </p><p>9.

THE 301 </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT POINTS UP THE FALLACY OF THE HEALTH MINISTER\'S </p><p>ARGUMENTS TO US (REFTEL) -- THAT IS, THAT SINCE THE GOC IS </p><p>COMPLYING WITH TRIPS, IT DOES NOT NEED TO RATIFY THE MOU -- </p><p>AND EXPOSES HIS POSITION AS PANDERING TO THE LOCAL INDUSTRY. </p><p>WHILE THERE IS MORE MOMENTUM THAN BEFORE TO RATIFY THE MOU, </p><p>THERE WILL ALSO BE A TEMPTATION ON THE PART OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, LOOKING AT THE LONG TIMELINE BEFORE THE NEXT 301 </p><p>REVIEW, TO PUT THIS ON THE BACK BURNER.
