<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 000909 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/P, IO, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. </p><p>MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  05-29-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, CE, UN, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka\'s foreign policy:  Prime Minister </p><p>tilts toward U.S., but faces resistance </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 873, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Since coming to power, PM Wickremesinghe </p><p>has taken steps to steer Sri Lankan foreign policy </p><p>closer to the U.S.  In doing this, he has had successes, </p><p>including the signing of an ICC waiver with the U.S. and </p><p>in regard to Iraq where the GSL steered a constructive </p><p>course.  Moreover, one of his key ministers recently </p><p>proposed that the GSL take the lead in forming some sort </p><p>of counterweight to NAM.  That said, the PM\'s initiative </p><p>has faced stiff resistance from MFA bureaucrats.  In </p><p>addition, the president and Opposition, backed by much </p><p>of the press and the intelligentsia, have cut into his </p><p>room for maneuver via their generally anti-U.S. biases. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In the post-Iraq war environment, we think the </p><p>GSL will continue to want to draw closer to the U.S. </p><p>With the PM facing a precarious cohabitation situation, </p><p>however, additional steps toward the USG will have to be </p><p>carefully plotted out.  Nonetheless, with Sri Lanka </p><p>facing a difficult peace process and needing help to </p><p>constrain the Tamil Tigers, we think the larger trend in </p><p>the country provides ballast for the PM\'s pro-U.S. </p><p>proclivities.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>PM tilts toward U.S. </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Since coming to power in late 2001, Prime </p><p>Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken steps to steer </p><p>Sri Lankan foreign policy closer to the U.S. </p><p>Wickremesinghe\'s pro-U.S. views have been long-standing </p><p>and are in part a function of family connections.  His </p><p>uncle, J.R. Jayewardene, for example, was Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>president from the late 1970s through the late 1980s, </p><p>and maintained very close links with the U.S. </p><p>(Note:  In fact, Jayewardene was called "Yankee Dickey" </p><p>by leftists for years.)  Moreover, Wickremesinghe, who </p><p>comes from a very wealthy business family, is a strong </p><p>advocate of free enterprise and strongly opposed to the </p><p>disastrous socialist policies of former governments. </p><p>Wickremesinghe is also surprisingly knowledgeable about </p><p>U.S. history and politics; he is an avid reader about </p><p>the American Civil War, U.S. military history, and U.S. </p><p>legislation.  The prime minister\'s pro-U.S. views also </p><p>emerge out of his political calculus that Sri Lanka </p><p>needs the support of the international community, </p><p>especially the U.S., to constrain the Tamil Tigers. </p><p>With the peace process his government\'s number one </p><p>priority bar none, the prime minister has worked hard to </p><p>secure U.S. support for his efforts in this area from </p><p>very early on in his tenure. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In pursuing this pro-U.S. course, Wickremesinghe </p><p>has been supported by two dynamic advisers, Minister of </p><p>Constitutional Affairs G.L. Peiris and Minister of </p><p>Economic Reform Milinda Moragoda.  (Note:  Beyond their </p><p>official titles, both Peiris and Moragoda play key roles </p><p>as peace process negotiators and policy formulators for </p><p>the GSL.)  In general, the Oxford-educated Peiris\' focus </p><p>has been more on cultivating ties with former colonial </p><p>power Britain and other Commonwealth countries, but he </p><p>is very pro-U.S. and often visits Washington.  More than </p><p>Peiris\', Moragoda\'s direct focus has been on cultivating </p><p>relations with the U.S. and with India.  Re the U.S., </p><p>the intelligent, articulate Moragoda is a perfect fit. </p><p>Born in Washington, D.C, he is a dual national Amcit </p><p>(please protect) married to an American, with plenty of </p><p>Washington connections, many from his days as a visiting </p><p>fellow at the Heritage Foundation and at Harvard.  A </p><p>"big picture" person, Moragoda is also highly aware that </p><p>the U.S. is the most powerful country in the world, and </p><p>he feels that it is better that Sri Lanka recognize that </p><p>fact and work within it. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) (((Note:  Of late, the duo of Peiris and </p><p>Moragoda have been joined by a new pro-U.S. player:  In </p><p>just several months on the job, Ambassador Devinda </p><p>Subasinghe, a U.S.-educated financier and close friend </p><p>of the PM, has already made a mark in Washington.))) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Pro-U.S. Policy reaps some Successes </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In moving forward on a pro-U.S. agenda, the PM </p><p>has had some notable successes.  Last November, for </p><p>example, he overruled the recalcitrant Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs (see more below re the MFA) and had the </p><p>GSL sign an Article 98 waiver to the International </p><p>Criminal Court (ICC) agreement with the U.S.  While this </p><p>agreement did not receive much local publicity, the move </p><p>placed Sri Lanka squarely in the U.S. camp on an issue </p><p>of high importance to us.  In another sign of a pro-U.S. </p><p>tilt, the PM directed the MFA to take a relatively </p><p>moderate posture regarding Operation Iraqi Freedom, </p><p>despite strong anti-U.S., anti-war currents in Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s polity, including from the large Muslim </p><p>population (see Reftels).  Although the government\'s </p><p>statement was not all we would have wanted, it was </p><p>relatively constructive, with the prime minister going </p><p>so far as to ask us for comments re the draft. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) More recently, Minister Moragoda made a </p><p>startling proposal to U.S. officials.  In discussions in </p><p>Washington, Moragoda stated that the GSL was interested </p><p>in forming some sort of group that would counter the </p><p>Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) block of countries.  Moragoda </p><p>was a bit vague about his idea.  He indicated, however, </p><p>that the GSL -- although a charter member of the group </p><p>since its formation decades ago -- felt that the NAM was </p><p>too strident and too anti-U.S., and that greater </p><p>practicality was now called for.  The way forward is </p><p>still being worked on, but once the idea is fleshed out </p><p>further, the current thinking is that PM Wickremesinghe </p><p>might announce some sort of formal proposal re a new </p><p>grouping at the UN General Assembly this September. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) (((Note:  Aside from the ICC, Iraq, and </p><p>Moragoda\'s proposal, the government has also made an </p><p>effort to draw closer to the U.S. in economic/commercial </p><p>and defense-related areas.  The GSL, for example, inked </p><p>a Trade and Investment Agreement, "TIFA," with the U.S. </p><p>last year.  On the defense side, the government has </p><p>consistently supported U.S. military operations with </p><p>blanket overflight and landing clearances as well as </p><p>access to ports.  As the peace process continues, the </p><p>military has also begun to look toward increasing </p><p>participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations </p><p>and accepting a larger role in assisting the U.S. in the </p><p>global war on terror.  Most recently, the government </p><p>even has begun to explore ways of possibly assisting in </p><p>Iraqi reconstruction efforts.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Resistance from MFA, Opposition, etc. </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The PM\'s tilt toward the U.S. has faced stiff </p><p>resistance from bureaucrats in the MFA, who are wedded </p><p>to NAM, "G-77"-type thinking.  As mentioned above, for </p><p>example, the MFA fought tooth-and-nail against the </p><p>proposed ICC waiver.  Because of resistance at the </p><p>working level, signing of the agreement was delayed for </p><p>several weeks, as MFA bureaucrats made various changes </p><p>meant to weaken the text.  Mission, collaborating </p><p>closely with Moragoda and others at the political-level, </p><p>fended off these attempts and the accord was eventually </p><p>signed.  Re the government\'s statement re Iraq, it was </p><p>also clear to Mission that elements in the MFA wanted to </p><p>take a line that hewed much more closely to the French- </p><p>German-Russian anti-U.S., pro-Saddam Hussein position. </p><p>(Note:  The MFA\'s deadening hand is also noticeable in </p><p>UN voting.  Despite strong USG efforts, for example, the </p><p>GSL only abstained on the recent UNCHR vote re the </p><p>Castro regime\'s atrocious human rights record.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) (((Note:  Foreign Minister Tyronne Fernando is </p><p>actually quite friendly to the U.S.  In fact, Fernando </p><p>has been one of those in the government who have told us </p><p>that Sri Lanka should separate itself more from NAM. </p><p>Fernando\'s effectiveness in communicating these views to </p><p>his ministry are hampered by the fact that he has been </p><p>ill with a serious heart condition and does not seem to </p><p>be a hands-on manager in any case.  Moreover, while he </p><p>has not announced it officially, Fernando also makes no </p><p>bones about the fact that he wants to be the next UN </p><p>Secretary General after Kofi Annan\'s term is up.  Due to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>this latter factor, Fernando seems to go out of his way </p><p>at times not to rock the boat and challenge the "UN </p><p>consensus."  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) In addition to the entrenched bureaucracy in </p><p>the MFA, Wickremesinghe\'s tilt toward the U.S. has also </p><p>encountered sharp resistance from the president, her </p><p>People\'s Alliance (PA) party, and the radical Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party.  While she is not anti- </p><p>U.S. per se, President Kumaratunga -- who shares a very </p><p>tense cohabitation relationship with the PM -- is not </p><p>particularly friendly to our international positions on </p><p>issues as diverse as Iraq, climate change, the ICC, </p><p>general North/South affairs, etc.  Kumaratunga\'s stance </p><p>seems to be strongly influenced by the fact that her </p><p>parents, who were both prime ministers, were advocates </p><p>of NAM-type thinking on the international stage.  The </p><p>president\'s Sorbonne education also appears to have </p><p>affected her and she is quite pro-French.  As could be </p><p>expected, the president\'s PA party basically mirrors her </p><p>perspectives.  As for the leftist JVP, the party has </p><p>always been strongly anti-U.S., accusing us routinely in </p><p>public of being the "arch-imperialist.  Given that an </p><p>alliance between a large section of the PA with the JVP </p><p>is set to be announced soon, there is little indication </p><p>that Opposition views of the U.S. will improve in the </p><p>near-term. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) It is also the case that much of the </p><p>intelligentsia in Sri Lanka and much of the press share </p><p>a general anti-U.S. bias.  Intellectuals, such as they </p><p>are in Sri Lanka, are mostly influenced by Marxism to a </p><p>large extent with a fair amount having studied in the </p><p>former Soviet Union, and they routinely chatter against </p><p>U.S. "hegemony" and "world empire."  In the meantime, </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s press -- both the English and vernacular -- </p><p>contains a large amount of anti-U.S. commentary, </p><p>including the ritual condemnations of our policy on Iraq </p><p>and alleged excesses in the war on terrorism.  The </p><p>government, including PM Wickremesinghe and especially </p><p>Moragoda, also come under considerable heat for </p><p>allegedly wanting to make Sri Lanka a U.S. "lackey." </p><p>(Note:  While the newspapers have their decided biases, </p><p>TV and radio in Sri Lanka are generally apolitical on </p><p>international issues -- but not on domestic issues where </p><p>they tend to take sides.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) In the post-Iraq war environment, we think the </p><p>Sri Lankan government will continue to want to draw </p><p>closer to the U.S.  The prime minister faces a very </p><p>precarious cohabitation situation, however, with his </p><p>party holding control of Parliament by only several </p><p>seats.  Given this situation, the PM will have to </p><p>consider carefully how additional steps toward us might </p><p>affect his domestic political standing.  Too sharp a </p><p>tilt toward the U.S. could potentially subject him to </p><p>harsh criticism from the Opposition, which will </p><p>reverberate to the prime minister\'s disadvantage in </p><p>press channels and among the leftist intellectual set. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Nonetheless, with Sri Lanka facing a difficult </p><p>peace process and needing help to constrain the </p><p>unpredictable Tamil Tigers, we think the larger trend in </p><p>the country provides sizable ballast for the PM\'s pro- </p><p>U.S. proclivities.  (Note:  In general, polls show that </p><p>Sri Lankans of all ethnic groups view the U.S. in a very </p><p>friendly way.)  One key test of the prime minister\'s </p><p>chosen course is whether he uses UNGA to take on NAM and </p><p>propose some sort of new grouping.  If he does that, he </p><p>would have consummated a dramatic shift in his country\'s </p><p>foreign policy orientation.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
