<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001544 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, EINV, BEXP, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN TELECOMS PREPARED FOR CONFLICT PRESSURES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: In recent meetings with Jordanian telecom </p><p>operators, we were assured that fixed-line and wireless </p><p>telecom networks were prepared for pressures on their systems </p><p>in the event of a conflict in neighboring Iraq.  Plans have </p><p>been made to protect physical infrastructure, fleets, </p><p>offices, and equipment, and officials fully expected their </p><p>networks to be able to handle any strains on the system </p><p>brought on by heavy call volume. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) There are but two major players in the Jordanian </p><p>telecom sector: Jordan Telecom (JT), (owned by the Jordanian </p><p>Government--41.5%, France Telecom--40%, the Social Security </p><p>Corporation--13%, and miscellaneous investors--5.5%) and </p><p>parent company of mobile provider MobileCom, and Fastlink, </p><p>recently purchased from Egyptian Orascom by the Kuwaiti </p><p>Mobile Telecommunications Company.  JT currently has 650,000 </p><p>land-line subscribers.  Fastlink dominates the wireless </p><p>market, however, with 700,000 subscribers to MobileCom\'s </p><p>300,000.  More rapid than expected growth in Fastlink\'s </p><p>client base last year put a strain on the company\'s </p><p>infrastructure, resulting in occasional periods of system </p><p>failure, most notably during a snowstorm in January, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>FASTLINK IS FINE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On March 12, Fastlink CEO Michael Dagher told us </p><p>that since last year, the company has spent $120 million </p><p>upgrading its infrastructure, and he was confident any surge </p><p>in traffic could "smoothly" be accommodated in the event of </p><p>conflict.  He pointed out that there were no system outages </p><p>during the late February blizzard in Amman, when the city was </p><p>carpeted with 28 inches of snow, likewise during the recent </p><p>Eid holidays when the network was handling twice the normal </p><p>local traffic.  He attributed the increase in capacity to the </p><p>upgrades, and expressed confidence that Fastlink could, at </p><p>present, handle 1.5 million customers at any given time. </p><p>Dagher said he was more concerned about international calls, </p><p>given what he said was limited capacity on the part of JT, </p><p>currently the only legal provider for international traffic </p><p>in and out of Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Dagher also said that the company is working with </p><p>the Ministry of Information Communication and Technology </p><p>(MOICT) regarding security of Fastlink buildings and </p><p>infrastructure, which is largely located within the Amman </p><p>headquarters.  Fastlink also has towers spread out throughout </p><p>the country, and those will be guarded as well.  Dagher added </p><p>that Fastlink will depend on cameras, alarms, and a large </p><p>(100 person) security force to protect company assets, </p><p>including Dagher\'s private home. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>JT READY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Olivier Faure, JT Director of Marketing, told us </p><p>March 9 they had "no worries" about the system\'s ability to </p><p>handle either heightened domestic volume or international </p><p>calls.  He said that 70% of Jordan Telecom\'s traffic is </p><p>within the Middle East and that the network is fully equipped </p><p>to handle it.  Faure said the company also had no strong </p><p>concerns about international traffic backing up.  He said </p><p>additional switches recently added by JT should help the </p><p>network accommodate calls from Jordan to the United States. </p><p>He added that JT "can not control how traffic comes in," and </p><p>fell back on the familiar JT refrain about long distance </p><p>traffic bypassing JT\'s infrastructure via low-cost foreign </p><p>carriers or pirated by illegal voice over IP operators. </p><p>Faure said that MobileCom recorded no outages during the </p><p>recent snowstorm, and that only a few of JT\'s fixed-line </p><p>customers lost service due to phone lines downed by trees or </p><p>heavy snow. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Regarding JT\'s infrastructure, Faure said that the </p><p>company\'s concerns were twofold: collateral or intentional </p><p>damage to infrastructure, and interruption of fuel/energy </p><p>supplies.  Regarding the former, he said JT was working with </p><p>the government to get extra police and military protection </p><p>for buildings, switches, and towers.  Faure said the bigger </p><p>problem could be servicing the network should either the JT </p><p>maintenance fleet be unable to move due to a cutoff in fuel </p><p>stocks, or equipment suffer damage as a result of an </p><p>interruption in energy supply or flow.  On the whole, </p><p>however, Faure said both the wireless and the fixed-line </p><p>networks would be "okay." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Unlike the 2001 snowstorm, when the Fastlink </p><p>network went down for a number of hours, Jordanian telecoms </p><p>seem well-prepared for any surge in volume due to possible </p><p>conflict in Iraq.  If last month\'s blizzard, which </p><p>effectively shut down the city for almost four days, was a </p><p>test-run of sector infrastructure\'s ability to handle an </p><p>increase, it appears that the confidence of Jordanian telecom </p><p>officials may not be misplaced, absent any serious and </p><p>long-term damage to infrastructure or equipment.  On the </p><p>other hand, problems--unrelated to military operations--with </p><p>poor quality inbound voice and fax service can be expected to </p><p>persist until the GOJ takes decisive action to address the </p><p>regulatory and pricing issues that are their core. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
