WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) PRESENTED "NOTES FOR A </p><p>CONSULTATION ON STRATEGIC ISSUES" IN ROME ON JANUARY 14, </p><p>2003. WFP REITERATED ITS INTENT TO INTENSIFY ITS FOCUS IN </p><p>COUNTRIES WITH THE GREATEST NEED - WHICH IT DEFINED AS THOSE </p><p>WITH A PER CAPITA GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDI) OF LESS THAN </p><p>USD 885 AND A RATE OF UNDER-5 CHILD STUNTING GREATER THAN 30 </p><p>PERCENT. THE TARGET WOULD BE TO DEDICATE 75 PERCENT OF WFP\'S </p><p>DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO THESE 29 COUNTRIES BY THE END OF </p><p>THE 2004-2005 BIENNIUM. WFP FURTHER PROPOSED FOUR PROGRAM </p><p>WORK OBJECTIVES: A) SUPPORTING UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATION </p><p>AND REDUCING GENDER DISPARITY IN ACCESS TO EDUCATION; B) </p><p>SUPPORTING IMPROVED HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE GROUPS </p><p>THROUGH NUTRITION EDUCATION; C) SAVING LIVES IN CRISIS </p><p>SITUATIONS; AND D) PRESERVING LIVELIHOODS IN CRISIS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00341  01 OF 03  291509Z </p><p>SITUATIONS. THE NOTES RECOGNIZED THAT WFP RISKS LOSING ITS </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS IF ITS RESOURCES AND CAPACITY ARE SPREAD TOO </p><p>THIN. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. THESE NOTES FORM PART OF A WORK IN PROCESS LEADING UP TO </p><p>A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK TO BE SUBMITTED FOR EXECUTIVE BOARD </p><p>APPROVAL IN MAY 2003. THE NOTES REFLECT THE WFP </p><p>SECRETARIAT\'S RECOGNITION THAT WFP\'S DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HAS PRECIPITOUSLY FALLEN OVER THE PAST DECADE - FROM ALMOST </p><p>U.S. DOLLARS 1 BILLION A DECADE AGO TO U.S. DOLLARS 273 </p><p>MILLION THIS PAST YEAR, WITH THE CLEAR IMPROBABILITY THAT </p><p>THIS TREND WILL BE REVERSED IN THE FUTURE. DESPITE THE </p><p>ISSUANCE OF THE WFP FOOD FOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY (FAAD) IN </p><p>1999, THE REALITY IS THAT A NUMBER OF MAJOR DONORS (EC, </p><p>SWEDEN, JAPAN, THE NETHERLANDS) HAVE MADE A POLICY DECISION </p><p>NOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO WFP\'S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. MOREOVER, </p><p>THE UNITED STATES HAS REPEATEDLY ASKED THAT BOTH WFP AND THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE BOARD REFOCUS ON THE KEY RECOMMENDATION OF THE </p><p>1994 TRIPARTITE EVALUATION OF WFP (NORWAY, THE NETHERLANDS, </p><p>AND CANADA) WHICH SUGGESTED THAT WFP REDUCE THE NUMBER OF </p><p>COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT FUNCTIONS TO ABOUT 50. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>WHAT WFP PROPOSES FROM THIS POINT ONWARD </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. WFP\'S SECRETARIAT SUGGESTS GENERALLY PURSUING THE UN\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00341  01 OF 03  291509Z </p><p>FIRST MILLENIUM DEVELOPMENT GOAL(MDG), I.E., THE ERADICATION </p><p>OF HUNGER AND POVERTY. SPECIFICALLY, IN CRISIS </p><p>(CONFLICT/DISPLACEMENT, NATURAL DISASTER, DROUGHT/FLOOD, </p><p>HIV/AIDS, ECONOMIC SHOCKS) - WFP WOULD CAST ITS FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE AS PREVENTING VULNERABLE PEOPLE FROM SLIDING INTO </p><p>CHRONIC HUNGER. WFP SEES ITSELF WELL POSITIONED TO </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO MEETING THE MDG BOTH IN EMERGENCIES AND IN </p><p>MORE STABLE SITUATIONS AND IS THEREFORE NOT LIMITED TO </p><p>ACTIVITIES SUPPORTED THOUGH ONE FUNDING MECHANISM I.E., </p><p>DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. WFP LISTED FOUR PROGRAM WORK OBJECTIVES: A) SUPPORTING </p><p>UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATION AND REDUCING GENDER DISPARITY IN </p><p>ACCESS TO EDUCATION; B) SUPPORTING IMPROVED HEALTH OF </p><p>CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE GROUPS THROUGH NUTRITION EDUCATION; </p><p>C) SAVING LIVES IN CRISIS SITUATIONS; AND D) PRESERVING </p><p>LIVELIHOODS IN CRISIS SITUATIONS. TWO THEMES DESCRIBE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN OBJECTIVES. GENDER CONSIDERATIONS WOULD APPLY </p><p>TO ALL THEMES AS A CROSS-CUTTING ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>5. IN GENERAL, THE TIGHTENED WORK OBJECTIVES IMPLY MORE </p><p>DIRECT FEEDING ACTIVITIES, ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN. ON FOOD- </p><p>FOR-WORK, THERE WOULD BE INCREASED CONCENTRATION ON </p><p>PRESERVING LIVELIHOODS DURING CRISES; THERE WOULD ALSO BE A </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1515 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00341  02 OF 03  291510Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PRM-00   SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------2DA883  291705Z /38 </p><p>P 291436Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7852 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERN </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2483 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3071 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 000341 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR A/S IO HOLMES, A/S PRM DEWEY, IO/EDA WINNICK </p><p>USAID FOR AA/DCHA WINTER, D/DCHA/FFP LANDIS, DCHA/PPE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00341  02 OF 03  291510Z </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR MCHAMBLISS/RTILSWORTH </p><p>USUN NEW YORK FOR CSERWER </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p>NAIROBI FOR REDSO NESTES </p><p>TOKYO FOR USAID REP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, AORC, WFP, UN, PREF, EU </p><p>SUBJECT:   WFP FOOD AID - A "FIRST CUT" ON FUTURE WFP </p><p>PROGRAMMING DIRECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN FOOD-FOR-WORK FOR ASSET CREATION, </p><p>NATURAL RESOURCES ACTIVITIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>IN HOW MANY COUNTRIES SHOULD WFP WORK? </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. WFP FLOATED A "BALLON D\'ESSAI" ("TRIAL BALLOON") TO FOCUS </p><p>ITS DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES ON 29 COUNTRIES WHOSE PER CAPITA </p><p>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDI) IS LESS THAN U.S. DOLLARS 885 </p><p>AND WHOSE RATE OF UNDER-5 CHILD STUNTING IS GREATER THAN 30 </p><p>PERCENT. THE TARGET WOULD BE TO DEDICATE 75 PERCENT OF WFP\'S </p><p>DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO THESE 29 COUNTRIES BY THE END OF </p><p>THE 2004-2005 BIENNIUM. NOTE: WFP PRESENTLY IMPLEMENTS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN 54 COUNTRIES. END NOTE. THERE WAS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE REACTION TO THIS PROPOSAL, PARTICULARLY FROM </p><p>ASIAN AND LATIN AMERICAN PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES PRESENT. </p><p>CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS ARE NECESSARY NOT ONLY TO REACH </p><p>CONSENSUS ON THIS DE FACTO "DOWNSIZING" CRITERIA, BUT ALSO </p><p>TO DEVELOP SPECIFIC COUNTRY PHASE OUT TIMETABLES.

WFP\'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WANTS TO INCREASE WFP\'S REVENUE </p><p>BASE FROM ABOUT 1.9 BILLION DOLLARS TO 3 BILLION DOLLARS PER </p><p>YEAR.  THIS REQUIRES GREATLY EXPANDED TRADITIONAL DONOR </p><p>SUPPORT, REACHING OUT CREATIVELY TO NON-TRADITIONAL DONORS, </p><p>ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND IMPROVING LEVERAGE OF </p><p>RESOURCES.  FOR EXAMPLE, INDIA, AN EMERGING DONOR, HAS </p><p>AGREED TO DONATE 1 MILLION TONS OF WHEAT FOR AFGHANISTAN. </p><p>OTHER EMERGING DONORS INCLUDE ALGERIA, VIET NAM, THAILAND, </p><p>THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA (RSA), THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION </p><p>AND PAKISTAN. IN ADDITION, WFP IS BEGINNING TO SEEK OUT </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERSHIPS, COGNIZANT THAT UNICEF RECEIVES </p><p>MORE THAN 30 PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM PRIVATE DONATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>8. SPECIFICALLY, WFP WILL: </p><p> </p><p>-ASK CASH DONORS TO ALLOW WFP TO "TWIN" THEIR CASH WITH THE </p><p>COMMODITY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM EMERGING DONORS (SEE REF A); </p><p>-ASK THOSE DONORS THAT PREFER TO HAVE THEIR CASH DONATIONS </p><p>USED TO PURCHASE FOOD TO ALLOW WFP TO PURCHASE THAT FOOD </p><p>FROM EMERGING DONORS, WHERE SUCH A TRANSACTION MEETS THE </p><p>TEST OF TIMELINESS OF DELIVERY, QUALITY OF PRODUCT AND COST </p><p>COMPETITIVENESS; </p><p>-ASK DONORS TO ESTABLISH A FUND (OR OTHER FINANCIAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00341  02 OF 03  291510Z </p><p>FACILITY) UNDER WHICH WFP WOULD HAVE AVAILABLE CASH TO MATCH </p><p>WITH THE COMMODITY CONTRIBUTIONS OF EMERGING DONORS; </p><p>-ASK PRIVATE-SECTOR DONORS TO ALLOW WFP THE MAXIMUM </p><p>FLEXIBILITY (ALONG THE ABOVE LINES) IN USING CASH </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO LEVERAGE COMMODITY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM </p><p>EMERGING DONORS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. SIMPLY, WAR AND DROUGHT (PARTICULARLY IN SUB-SAHARAN </p><p>AFRICA) HAVE DRASTICALLY RATCHETED UP HUMANITARIAN FOOD AID </p><p>NEEDS AND OVERWHELMED WFP\'S RESOURCING CAPACITY. THE </p><p>STRATEGIC NOTES PAPER RECOGNIZES THAT THE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES ARE ABOUT HALF </p><p>OF WHAT ARE NEEDED FOR APPROVED COUNTRY PROGRAMS.  WFP IS </p><p>INTENT ON FINDING WAYS OF MAXIMIZING INPUTS FROM EMERGING </p><p>DONORS, BUT THIS RUNS INTO THE CONVENTIONAL FULL COST </p><p>RECOVERY BARRIER WHERE ALL DONORS ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY ALL </p><p>COSTS, BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT, ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR </p><p>DONATION. CLEARLY, WFP RECOGNIZES THAT IT RISKS LOSING ITS </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS IF ITS RESOURCES AND CAPACITY ARE SPREAD TOO </p><p>THIN.
