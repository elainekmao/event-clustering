<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 000299 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NP/NPC/ECNP FOR KCROUCH, LONDON </p><p>AND ROME FOR CUSTOMS ATTACHES, DOC/BIS FOR RCUPPITT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PARM, PREL, PTER, KSTC, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAEG FORMING CABINET LEVEL COMMITTEE </p><p>          TO MANAGE EXPORT CONTROLS PORTFOLIO </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a 1/14 meeting with MFA Minstate Hamdan Bin </p><p>Zayid Al-Nahyan (other topics reported septel), the </p><p>Ambassador pressed Hamdan and MFA Assistant Undersecretary </p><p>Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuaimi on the need to jumpstart the </p><p>export controls training initiatives put on hold since </p><p>October 2002.  She noted that this issue was center stage </p><p>during the Bilateral Dialogue and that we were eager to move </p><p>forward as soon as possible.  She hoped that the UAEG could </p><p>schedule the WMD Commodity Identification Course in </p><p>February. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hamdan briefed that the MFA had run up against </p><p>roadblocks in the UAE "interagency" process and had been </p><p>unable to recruit the high quality of attendees merited for </p><p>this training.  Hamdan wants to avoid a potentially </p><p>embarrassing situation if the wrong candidates are put </p><p>forward for training.  He has decided to take up the matter </p><p>at the next Cabinet meeting, scheduled for 1/27, where he </p><p>will recommend the formation of a Cabinet-level committee to </p><p>manage the portfolio.  Through this mechanism, Hamdan hopes </p><p>to achieve "buy-in" from his ministerial colleagues. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  Hamdan and his subordinates at the MFA are </p><p>clearly frustrated by the bureaucratic inertia which has </p><p>impeded progress on our bilateral EXBS agenda.  Previously </p><p>the Ministry of Economy and Commerce was deemed responsible </p><p>for federal-level customs issues (a key element in the </p><p>planned EXBS training road-map) and did a lackluster job </p><p>organizing a program for a visiting USG team on "Trade-Based </p><p>Money Laundering."  By bumping export controls up to the </p><p>Cabinet level, Hamdan is placing the issue on the </p><p>national/federal agenda, where it rightly belongs, given its </p><p>importance to our relationship and the UAE\'s national </p><p>security. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
