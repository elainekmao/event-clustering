<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 VIENNA 00031 </p><p> </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS BRATISLAVA 002 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, LO </p><p>SUBJECT:  INDEPENDENT SLOVAKIA ENTERS THE WORLD STAGE </p><p> </p><p>1.  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE -- ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  WITH THE FANFARE OF FIREWORKS, THE ROAR OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF ROCKETS, THE UNCORKING OF HUNDREDS OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE, SLOVAKS CELEBRATED </p><p>NOT ONLY THE COMING OF THE NEW YEAR JANUARY 1 BUT ALSO </p><p>THE MILENNIAL ACHIEVEMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT STATE.  THE </p><p>SLOVAK PARLIAMENT, MEETING ON THAT DAY, FORMALLY ISSUED </p><p>A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.  OFFICIALS ATTENDED A </p><p>HIGH MASS THAT DAY, AND HELD A RECEPTION FOR AMBASSADORS </p><p>OR CHARGES FROM THE SEVENTYODD COUNTRIES THAT HAVE </p><p>ALREADY RECOGNIZED SLOVAKIA.  THE SPIRIT OF THE DAY </p><p>SEEMED TO BE "WE CAN DO IT;" A SUBTLE PSYCHOLOGICAL TURN </p><p>SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED TO THE REALIZATION THAT SLOVAKS </p><p>NOW ARE TRULY ON THEIR OWN.  THE MAKINGS OF A NEW STATE </p><p>ARE STILL INCOMPLETE, AND THE UNCERTAINTIES OF OUTSIDERS </p><p>WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO BE RELIEVED.  AS SLOVAKS RETURN </p><p>TO THEIR EVERYDAY CARES, THEY WILL SOON FIND OUT WHAT IS </p><p>IN STORE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN OF INDEPENDENCE. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE SQUARE OF THE SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING, </p><p>BRATISLAVA\'S MAIN SQUARE, WHICH HAS WITNESSED MANY </p><p>DRAMAS OF SLOVAK HISTORY SINCE IT WAS FILLED TO </p><p>OVERFLOWING IN THE HEADY DAYS OF THE NOVEMBER 1989 </p><p>REVOLUTION WAS THE SCENE OF ONE MORE EPOCHAL EVENT AS </p><p>CHURCH BELLS RANG IN THE NEW YEAR OVER THE SLOVAK </p><p>CAPITAL.  DESPITE THE COLD, THOUSANDS OF MERRY-MAKERS </p><p>FILLED THE SQUARE\'S LOWER PORTION, TO HEAR PRIME </p><p>MINISTER VLADIMIR MECIAR ANNOUNCE THAT SLOVAKIA WAS NOW </p><p>INDEPENDENT.  MANY, HOWEVER, WERE TOO INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>MERRIMENT OF THE MOMENT TO HEAR HIS WORDS.  THE NEXT </p><p>MORNING, HUNDREDS OF SLOVAKS LINED THE STREETS WAITING TO </p><p>BUY THE FIRST POSTAGE STAMPS OF THE NEW REPUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN A NEW YEAR\'S SPEECH TO THE NATION, MECIAR CALLED </p><p>THE DEMISE OF THE CSFR PART OF THE GEOPOLITICAL CHANGES </p><p>OCCURRING IN THE WORLD, AND ALSO OF THE DIFFERENT </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE CZECH AND SLOVAK </p><p>REPUBLICS AFTER 1989, AND OF THE "MISTAKES" MADE DURING </p><p>THAT TIME.  HE SAID THERE IS INDEED SOMETHING TO </p><p>CELEBRATE: NOT ONLY THE CULMINATION OF A MILLENIAL LONGING </p><p>FOR ONE\'S OWN STATE, BUT ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF DIRECTLY </p><p>PARTICIPATING IN EUROPEAN AND WORLD-WIDE INTEGRATION. </p><p>SLOVAK SECURITY WOULD BE GUARANTEED IN AN "ALL EUROPEAN </p><p>SECURITY SYSTEM." (NOTE: ON JANUARY 4, IN A SPEECH TO THE </p><p>BUDDING SLOVAK MILITARY, MECIAR SAID THAT AN ARMY IS NEED </p><p>BECAUSE, "WHILE WE HAVE NO ENEMIES, WE HAVE NO ALLIES </p><p>EITHER").  MECIAR DENIED THAT SLOVAKIA WOULD BE ISOLATED </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY, AND POINTED TO RAPID RECOGNITION BY OTHER </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN DESCRIBING RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., MECIAR CALLED </p><p>THEM "IMPORTANT."  HE SAID THAT, WHILE SOMEONE TRIED TO </p><p>"EMBITTER" THOSE RELATIONS TOWARD THE END OF LAST YEAR, HE </p><p>BELIEVED THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED (MECIAR REFERRED </p><p>TO THE EAVESDROPPING INCIDENT IMPLICITLY ONLY).  WHILE NOT </p><p>EXPLICITLY VOWING TO INSURE THAT SUCH INCIDENTS NOT REPEAT </p><p>THEMSELVES, MECIAR DID STATE THAT SLOVAKIA WILL RESPECT </p><p>THE INVIOLABILITY OF THE DIPLOMATIC OFFICES OF ALL STATES </p><p>AND ALL OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONVENTIONS.  AFTER MENTIONING THE U.S., MECIAR PLACED </p><p>RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE UKRAINE AND THEN WITH THE </p><p>CZECH REPUBLIC, RELATIONS WHICH HE SAID WOULD BE THE "MOST </p><p>NUMEROUS."  RELATIONS WITH AUSTRIA ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY\'S CHARACTER AS A MARKET ECONOMY AND </p><p>ADVANCED DEMOCRACY, AND WITH HUNGARY ON THE BASIS OF </p><p>"NON-INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS" AND "INVOLABILITY </p><p>OF BORDERS."  THE GABCIKOVO PROBLEM, MECIAR SAID, SHOULD </p><p>BE SOLVED BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MECIAR SAID THAT THE STRUCTURE OF SLOVAK </p><p>ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, </p><p>STARTING WITH CENTRAL STATE ORGANS AND CONTINUING WITH </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION; HE ASSURED THERE </p><p>WOULD BE NO "BLAVO(BRATISLAVA)CENTRALISM" TO MAKE UP FOR </p><p>THE DETESTED "PRAGOCENTRALISM."  THE COUNTRY WOULD BE </p><p>BUILT UP ACCORDING TO LEGAL NORMS PREVALENT IN THE EC. </p><p>PRIVATIZATION WOULD CONTINUE WITH THE AIM OF ESTABLISHING </p><p>AN ENTREPRENEURIAL CLASS.  MECIAR CLOSED BY NOTING THAT </p><p>"IF WE BELIEVE OURSELVES, THE WORLD WILL BELIEVE US AS </p><p>WELL." </p><p> </p><p>7.  AT A SESSION HELD ON THE MORNING OF JANUARY 1, THE </p><p>SLOVAK PARLIAMENT APPROVED A DECLARATION ANNOUNCING </p><p>SLOVAKIA AS ONE OF THE TWO SUCCESSOR STATES TO THE CSFR. </p><p>THE DECLARATION ASSURED THAT SLOVAKIA WOULD ASSUME ITS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COMMITMENTS AND BE GOVERNED ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE RULES OF A PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACY.  THE PARLIAMENT </p><p>DECLARED SLOVAKIA\'S INTENTION OF JOINING THE UN AND </p><p>COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND ITS READINESS TO EXCHANGE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS WITH ALL STATES BASED ON "FRIENDSHIP AND </p><p>PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE (NA MIEROVOM SPOLUNAZIVANI), ON THE </p><p>BASIS OF EQUALITY, NON-INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS, </p><p>AND INVOLABILITY OF BORDERS.  IN REMARKS BEFORE PARLIAMENT </p><p>THAT MORNING, MECIAR WARNED THAT THE COMING YEAR WOULD BE </p><p>"DIFFICULT," BUT NOT NECESSARILY MORE SO THAN PAST ONES. </p><p>PARLIAMENT SPEAKER IVAN GASPAROVIC, FOR HIS PART, ASKED </p><p>HIS COLLEAGUES FOR "UNITY," NOT IN THE FORMAL SENSE THAT </p><p>DISREGARDS THE NATURAL DIFFERENTIATION OF INTERESTS, BUT </p><p>ONE THAT PLACES POLITICAL STABILITY, SPIRITUAL RENEWAL, </p><p>AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AS AIMS FOR EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF </p><p>PARTY.  IN THE JANUARY 4 "PRACA," GASPAROVIC URGED HIS </p><p>FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN TO BE REALISTIC -- NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE </p><p>THEIR OWN POTENTIAL, BUT TO REALISTICALLY JUDGE THE </p><p>ECONOMIC, MORAL, AND PHYSICAL RESERVES OF THE COUNTRY AND </p><p>ITS POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  FOREIGN MINISTER MILAN KNAZKO, IN A JANUARY 1 PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE, SOUGHT TO PLACE SLOVAK FOREIGN POLICY IN THE </p><p>CONTOURS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AND SECURITY.  HE SAID </p><p>SLOVAKIA WANTS TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE VISEGRAD FOUR, AND </p><p>THAT AS FAR AS ARMS SALES ARE CONCERNED, SLOVAKIA WOULD </p><p>NOT EXPORT TO RISK AREAS AND WOULD SEEK TO COORDINATE ITS </p><p>APPROACH WITH SUCH STATES AS THE U.S. AND FRANCE.  HE </p><p>REJECTED THE NOTION OF A RENEWED "LITTLE ENTENTE" AGAINST </p><p>POSSIBLE FUTURE HUNGARIAN EXPANSIONISM.  FINALLY, HE </p><p>CAREFULLY FIELDED A JOURNALIST\'S QUESTION WHICH SOUGHT TO </p><p>FORCE HIM TO DIFFERENTIATE HIS CONCEPTION OF FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY FROM MECIAR\'S (MECIAR HAD PLACED THE U.S. FIRST IN </p><p>DISCUSSING FOREIGN RELATIONS, WHEREAS KNAZKO HAD SAID THAT </p><p>RELATIONS WITH SLOVAKIA\'S NEIGHBORS, ESPECIALLY THE CZECH </p><p>REPUBLIC, WOULD BE ITS PRIORITIES). </p><p> </p><p>9.  MARIAN TKAC, WHO IS ORGANIZING THE SLOVAK NATIONAL </p><p>BANK, PREDICTED IN A JANUARY 4 INTERVIEW IN "NARODNA </p><p>OBRODA" THAT ONCE FLOATED, SLOVAKIA\'S CURRENCY SHOULD NOT </p><p>LOSE MORE THAN 10 PCT OF ITS VALUE, WHICH HE CONSIDERS A </p><p>"FANTASTIC SUCCESS" GIVEN THE MUCH LARGER FALL IN THE </p><p>CZECHOSLOVAK KORUNA\'S VALUE SINCE 1990.  TKAC ALSO SAW ONE </p><p>OF THE MAIN ADVANTAGES OF INDEPENDENCE BEING THAT IT </p><p>ALLOWS SLOVAKIA TO EXECUTE ITS OWN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL </p><p>STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT:  WHILE TEARS SHED LAST WEEKEND WERE MOSTLY </p><p>TEARS OF JOY, A FEW DIE-HARDS GATHERED NEW YEAR\'S EVE TO </p><p>GRIEVE THE LOSS OF THEIR CZECH CONNECTION AT THE CZECH </p><p>LION -- THE TRADITIONAL MONUMENT TO CZECH-SLOVAK </p><p>STATEHOOD.  IN THE RECENT PAST, MANY SLOVAKS HAVE BEEN </p><p>GLOOMY ABOUT THE EFFECT OF INDEPENDENCE ON THEIR ECONOMIC </p><p>FUTURE.  THOSE THAT CELEBRATED, HOWEVER, SEEMED TO BE </p><p>GENUINELY ELATED AT THE NOVELTY OF LIVING IN THEIR OWN </p><p>STATE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN FUTURE.  ONE CAN </p><p>EXPECT THAT QUESTIONS ABOUT POLITICAL PLURALITY WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO PLAGUE THE RULING HZDS AS SLOVAKIA LOOKS AWAY </p><p>FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE AND MORE TOWARD DEVELOPING </p><p>BOTH POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY AS A STATE. </p><p>INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, KNAZKO AGAIN TOOK THE ROLE OF </p><p>DISSIDENT WITHIN HIS OWN MOVEMENT; IN REPLY TO A POLL </p><p>CONDUCTED BY "NARODNA OBRODA," (JANUARY 4), HE REJECTED </p><p>THE IDEA THAT THE HZDS A A MOVEMENT IS OVERSENITIVE TO </p><p>MEDIA CRITICISM, AND SUGGESTED THE QUESTIONER CONSIDER </p><p>WHICH SPECIFIC PERSONS ACT IN SUCH A WAY.  HE SAID HE </p><p>REGARDS THE OPPOSITION AS AN INDELIBLE PART OF A </p><p>PLURALISTIC SYSTEM AND AN INTELLIGENT OPPOSITION AS THE </p><p>BEST COLLABORATOR OF A GOVERNING POLITICAL GROUPING. </p><p>KNAZKO WAS ALSO TRUE TO THIS THOUGHT WHEN, IN A SIDE </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH CHARGE AFTER RECEIVING THE FIRST </p><p>DIPLOMATIC VISA ISSUED BY THE US EMBASSY, HE NOTED THAT IT </p><p>WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT IN A NEW SUNDAY WEEKLY INTERVIEW </p><p>PROGRAM, SLOVAK TV DECIDED TO HAVE THE WIVES OF PROMINENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT POLITICIANS (MRS. MECIAR, PROKES, GASPAROVIC, </p><p>WEISS, KOVAC), BUT NOT THE WIVES OF MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION.  HACKER UNQUOTE </p><p> </p><p>SWIHART </p><p></p></div>
