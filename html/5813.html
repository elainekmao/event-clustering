While Yemen is well-positioned in many areas such </p><p>as political reform, fiscal responsibility and health and </p><p>education expenditures, there is more work to be done.  The </p><p>ROYG, the USG and the World Bank should work together to make </p><p>sure that needed reforms are undertaken.  Qirbi agreed on the </p><p>vital importance of working together to ensure Yemen remains </p><p>a leading candidate.
