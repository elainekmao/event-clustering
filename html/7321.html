U.S. soldiers and </p><p>Iraqis pulled down a 15-meter bronze statue of Saddam in the </p><p>city center.  "Yeni Safak" says American tanks made a `show </p><p>of force\' in the heart of Baghdad, and, citing Reuters, adds </p><p>that coalition forces carried out terrible massacres in </p><p>southern Iraq.  Almost all papers drew a parallel between </p><p>the overthrow of Saddam\'s rule and the collapse of communist </p><p>regimes in Eastern Europe.  "Sabah" says everyone was wrong: </p><p>The allied operation in Iraq has disproved several views, </p><p>including the idea that Saddam would not be easily toppled, </p><p>that Baghdad would not fall without a siege, and that the </p><p>war couldn\'t be won without a northern front.  American and </p><p>British rule has begun in Iraq, and the process of </p><p>reshaping the Middle East has started, dailies report. </p><p>Papers highlight the U.S. Administration\'s warning to Iran, </p><p>Syria, and North Korea that Iraq should serve as a lesson to </p><p>all.  Now Ankara turns its eyes to the Americans and the </p><p>Kurdish groups advancing on Kirkuk and Mosul.  Citing </p><p>American papers, "Zaman" sees a Turkish military </p><p>intervention in Northern Iraq as unlikely, but notes that </p><p>the U.S. is closely following the reaction of TGS Chief </p><p>General Ozkok and political leaders in Ankara.  "Turkiye" </p><p>reports that KDP forces are near Mosul, and that the KDP has </p><p>surrounded  Kirkuk.  The paper claims that a crisis is </p><p>looming in Northern Iraq.  "Aksam" reports the TGS has sent </p><p>five officers to Northern Iraq to discuss with U.S. officers </p><p>the position of KDP forces around Mosul.  Ankara has asked </p><p>the KDP to end pressure on Turkomen towns.  President Sezer </p><p>said on Wednesday that Turkey wants Mosul and Kirkuk, eyed </p><p>by the Kurds, to remain within a united Iraq.  Meanwhile, </p><p>the MFA stated that Ankara would not accept the condition on </p><p>the $1 billion grant offer by the U.S. that Turkey would </p><p>refrain from entering Northern Iraq.  Prime Minister Erdogan </p><p>said it was the Americans\' decision to provide financial aid </p><p>to Turkey, so that Washington should refrain from giving the </p><p>impression that there is ongoing bargaining with Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Prime Minister Erdogan, who met with his Greek </p><p>counterpart Simitis at the Balkan Summit in Belgrade, said </p><p>that the UN peace plan for Cyprus should be reviewed, and </p><p>that bilateral talks for a compromise should continue. </p><p>Simitis reportedly said the Annan plan offered grounds for </p><p>on agreement, and that negotiations should continue within </p><p>the UN framework.  Both leaders agreed that the Cyprus </p><p>problem must be resolved as soon as possible, and that they </p><p>must find a way to move the process forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Fall of Baghdad </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"He did not even fire one honorary bullet" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief of mass appeal Hurriyet, Ertugrul Ozkok </p><p>observed (4/10): "The Saddam era has ended and the future of </p><p>the Iraqi people is now brighter than ever before.  In the </p><p>next 5 to 10 years, we are going to see the proper use of </p><p>oil money - that is, for the welfare of the people as </p><p>opposed to building kitsch palaces for dictators or </p><p>producing chemical weapons.  It is sure that in the years </p><p>ahead, we will observe the domino-effect on other `Baath- </p><p>like\' regimes in the region. . Yet it is also the time for </p><p>us to get rid of the `Third world rationale\' and `Saddam- </p><p>like\' mentality in Turkey.  It is just the right time to </p><p>lift Turkey up to become a full member of the modern western </p><p>community." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Iraq is only the beginning" </p><p>Erdal Safak editorialized in the mass appeal Sabah (4/10): </p><p>"The fall of Baghdad not only signified the end of Saddam, </p><p>but also the end of the Eisenhower doctrine, which had </p><p>served as a protective shield for regimes in the Middle East </p><p>since 1956. . Following the 9/11 attacks, the US has begun </p><p>to shape a new doctrine.  As Paul Wolfowitz defined it, `the </p><p>US cannot possibly be safe and secure unless the Middle East </p><p>is democratized.\' . The Iraq war is just the beginning. </p><p>Dictatorships and other backward regimes in the Middle East </p><p>are next on the list, and it is certain that the most </p><p>immediate concern is Syria. . Turkish Foreign Minister Gul </p><p>should urgently cancel his upcoming trip to Damascus, which </p><p>will only serve to increase misunderstandings between Turkey </p><p>and the US." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Toward the end" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in the Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(4/10): "The planners of the Iraq war did not conceal their </p><p>intention to move toward other countries once Iraq is </p><p>finished.  It will also be interesting to see what kind of </p><p>administration is to be formed in post-war Iraq.  .The world </p><p>is rapidly moving toward a new era, and it will most likely </p><p>be formed based on the `superiority of power.\'  From now on, </p><p>the US might target any country in the world by using </p><p>`magical\' terms such as liberation and freedom." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
