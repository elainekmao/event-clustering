<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001364 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/T (BLACKWOOD), WHA/CAN (RUNNING) </p><p> </p><p>HHS FOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, OFFICE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (STEIGER) </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR HOHMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, PREL, CA, WHO </p><p>SUBJECT: Framework Convention on Tobacco Control </p><p>(FCTC): Canadians Suggest We Reexamine Our Stance </p><p> </p><p>Ref. (A) OTTAWA 1304 </p><p>     (B) SECSTATE 106632 </p><p> </p><p>1. This cable contains an action request, see paragraph </p><p>11. </p><p> </p><p>2. As a follow-up to the official GoC response to our </p><p>request for support on removing the Reservations Clause </p><p>(Article 30) of the FCTC (Ref A), Canada\'s Department </p><p>of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) has </p><p>provided Embassy a detailed response to USG concerns </p><p>raised in reftel B. </p><p> </p><p>3. The DFAIT document claims that the GoC has examined </p><p>carefully USG concerns, and in particular the areas in </p><p>which the USG had indicated it might take reservations </p><p>(Ref B).  It offers the GoC assessment of three areas </p><p>in particular: Advertising, Promotions and Sponsorship; </p><p>Warning Labels and; Distribution of Free Samples. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Advertising, Promotion and Sponsorship </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. Our DFAIT interlocutors note that initially, this </p><p>was an area that posed challenges for Canada as well, </p><p>given their own constitutional requirements.  The GoC, </p><p>the documents states, "worked diligently to negotiate </p><p>wording that allowed for a constitutional "carve-out". </p><p>In our view the opening words in each of Articles 13.2, </p><p>13.3 and 13.4 provide excellent scope for governments </p><p>to take action that is consistent with their </p><p>constitutions." </p><p> </p><p>5. The DFAIT document also points out "the U.S. has </p><p>previously ratified agreements with limitations on </p><p>advertising containing a similar constitutional </p><p>qualification.   A constitutional qualification ("with </p><p>due regard to its constitutional provisions") was used </p><p>in Article 10 of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic </p><p>Substances, in the context of an obligation to prohibit </p><p>advertising of psychotropic substances to the public. </p><p>The UN commentary on this provision suggests that </p><p>Article 10(2) was drafted in order to require States to </p><p>prohibit the advertisement of these substances to the </p><p>extent that they are allowed to do so by their </p><p>Constitutions.  No reservations or declarations have </p><p>been made regarding this clause, suggesting that the </p><p>qualifier has been sufficient to address the concerns </p><p>of States Parties (including the United States), which </p><p>include constitutional protections of the right to </p><p>freedom of expression." </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Warning Labels </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. With respect to Warning Labels, the DFAIT document </p><p>states: "With respect to Article 11.1, we would note </p><p>that the United States has ratified other treaties that </p><p>have required legislative changes." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Distribution of Free Samples </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. The DFAIT document declares that: "Article 16.2 is </p><p>not mandatory, since it provides the flexibility to </p><p>simply "promote" the prohibition of the distribution of </p><p>free tobacco products to the public and minors." </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Canada\'s Conclusion </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. The DFAIT document further states, "Based on these </p><p>considerations, our view is that the text of the </p><p>Convention should have enough flexibility to meet the </p><p>needs of the U.S. Government." </p><p> </p><p>9. The DFAIT document notes ".a number of governments </p><p>negotiating in Geneva, particularly representing </p><p>developing countries, were concerned that if </p><p>reservations were permitted in the Convention, their </p><p>governments would come under intense pressure from </p><p>tobacco companies to enter a large number of </p><p>reservations and undermine the treaty.  That is why </p><p>many governments resisted so strongly provisions that </p><p>would allow for reservations.  We expect that such </p><p>concerns would remain, and that any effort to reopen </p><p>the treaty text at the World Health Assembly could be </p><p>quite divisive and problematic." </p><p> </p><p>10.  The DFAIT document concludes that the GoC ".would </p><p>strongly encourage the U.S. government to re-examine </p><p>the flexibility that exists in the current text and </p><p>make the best use possible of this flexibility.  We </p><p>(Canada) would encourage the U.S. government not to </p><p>reopen the text at the World Health Assembly." </p><p> </p><p>11. Comment and Action request: The points contained in </p><p>the DFAIT document follow closely similar arguments </p><p>made by the Canadian Cancer Society in its recent </p><p>letter to Ambassador Cellucci.  While we hold out </p><p>little hope of changing the GoC\'s position prior to the </p><p>World Health Assembly (WHA) next week, we would </p><p>appreciate cleared points that we can use in responding </p><p>to DFAIT and to press inquiries which we expect as news </p><p>of our position on the FCTC begins to come out of </p><p>Geneva. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
