THEY SHARE THE U.S. VIEW THAT SADDAM IS A DANGER </p><p>TO THE WORLD, AND HAVE NOW COME TO SEE THE MERITS OF HIS </p><p>REMOVAL.  THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO OPPOSE WAR AS A MEANS TO </p><p>ACHIEVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S OBJECTIVES IN IRAQ, AND </p><p>IS INTENSIFYING ITS DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY TO HEAD OFF WAR. </p><p>FOLLOWING WEEKS OF SPECULATION OF POSSIBLE HOLY SEE </p><p>ENGAGEMENT WITH BAGHDAD, THE VATICAN CONFIRMED FEBRUARY 5 </p><p>THAT TARIQ AZIZ WOULD MEET WITH THE POPE FEBRUARY 14.  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINSTER TOLD US THE POPE WOULD URGE </p><p>BAGHDAD TO COMPLY WITH UN RESOLUTIONS TO AVOID WAR, BUT WOULD </p><p>ALSO EXPRESS SOLIDARITY WITH THE SUFFERING OF THE IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE.
