Per ref A, US Mission queried WFP\'s Deputy </p><p>Director for West Africa Arnold Verken who described </p><p>both present and planned World Food Program </p><p>operational steps which are described below. WFP is </p><p>in the process of chartering a supply ship to be used </p><p>as a mobile floating office off the coast of </p><p>Monrovia. A rack up of WFP\'s equipment funding needs </p><p>is provided in light of the growing magnitude of the </p><p>present crisis. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Current Plans </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. WFP is currently providing food to refugees and </p><p>IDPs in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia from the </p><p>current WFP West Africa Coastal Regional PRRO </p><p>(January - December 2003).  Liberian refugees in Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire are serviced under the WFP EMOP for Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire (May 1 - December 31, 2003). Current </p><p>Liberian refugee caseloads receiving WFP assistance </p><p>are as follows: 70,000 in Guinea, 53,000 in Sierra </p><p>Leone, and 35,000 in Cote d\'Ivoire.  There are an </p><p>estimated 175,000 plus IDPs in Liberia. </p><p> </p><p>3. The 2003 WFP PRRO is currently funded at 60 </p><p>percent (USD 34.4 million from a total of USD 57 </p><p>million), leaving USD 22.6 million yet to be funded. </p><p>It should be noted that USAID/DCHA/Office of Food for </p><p>Peace (FFP) is considering a new contribution of USD </p><p>7 million to the PRRO, which is not included in the </p><p>above figure.  Note: The level of WFP food </p><p>distributions in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea </p><p>has been lower than expected over the last year. </p><p>Thus, WFP has accumulated food stocks that could have </p><p>covered (with the 60 percent) the food requirements </p><p>to almost the end of the year, if current levels had </p><p>remained consistent throughout the rest of the year. </p><p>WFP expects that the levels of distributions will now </p><p>increase substantially, thus requiring the 40 percent- </p><p>unfunded balance.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>4. The Cote d\'Ivoire pipeline is quite critical right </p><p>now.  A pipeline break of oil, beans, and corn-soy </p><p>blend (CSB) in July has forced WFP to cut rations of </p><p>these commodities to IDPs, as well as refugees.  WFP </p><p>has drawn against the Immediate Response Account </p><p>(IRA), which must be repaid, to affect local </p><p>purchases.  Bids were opened on 9 July for rice, </p><p>maize meal, and oil.  Although the EMOP is funded at </p><p>about 60 percent, recently announced major </p><p>contributions from USAID and the European Union will </p><p>not arrive until the last quarter of the year.ASSY ROME </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, DCHA/AA WINTER, </p><p>DCHA/D/OFDA MCCONNELL, DCHA/D/FFP LANDIS </p><p>STATE FOR AS/AF KANSTEINER, DAS/PRM, IO/EDA </p><p>USDA FOR FAS CHAMBLISS, TILSWORTH AND FAS/ICD KRAMER, </p><p>LEBLANC </p><p>USUN FOR AMBASSADOR NEGRO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The launch of a United Nations (UN) special appeal </p><p>for Liberia in the near future is a distinct </p><p>possibility, reports WFP, once access inside Liberia </p><p>improves.  WFP, as well as other UN agencies, will </p><p>then be able to make a better determination of the </p><p>magnitude of the actual needs.  Some populations have </p><p>been inaccessible for months, therefore it is likely </p><p>that many will be in need of food assistance.  WFP </p><p>anticipates malnutrition rates also being high. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Current Operations inside Liberia </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. After the first attacks in Monrovia in early June, </p><p>WFP/Liberia distributed a 15-day ration to Internally </p><p>Displaced Persons (IDPs), refugees, and other </p><p>vulnerables in and near Monrovia between 13 - 23 </p><p>June, 2003, before a second attack occurred on June </p><p>23.  The ration consisted of 1,800 kilocalories (kc) </p><p>for IDPs and refugees (400 grams cereals, 50 grams </p><p>pulses, 25 grams vegetable oil, 5 grams of salt) and </p><p>1,880 kc for those in institutions and was provided </p><p>to the following: </p><p> </p><p>-56,979 IDPs living in (schools, churches, etc) </p><p>received 326 MT of food.  The estimated total of IDPs </p><p>in these shelters is 76,273; </p><p> </p><p>-1,500 IDPs in existing camps received 11 MT; </p><p> </p><p>-6,189 Sierra Leonean Refugees received 45 MT; </p><p> </p><p>-2,610 beneficiaries in institutions, such as </p><p>orphanages, hospitals, etc. received 39 MT. </p><p> </p><p>7. Following attacks in late June, WFP recommenced </p><p>its distributions on 5 July, and as of 12 July 2003, </p><p>the following had been provided: </p><p> </p><p>-39,311 IDPs in living in (schools, churches, etc); </p><p> </p><p>-849 beneficiaries in institutions received 18 MT. </p><p> </p><p>8. In addition ICRC was allocated 363 MT from WFP to </p><p>also assist 50,000 IDPs in irregular shelters </p><p>(schools, churches, etc.) and institutions. </p><p> </p><p>9. On July 11, WFP also began distributing food to </p><p>Sierra Leonean refugees in camps.  Refugees in VOA, </p><p>Banjor and Zuanah have been asked to receive their </p><p>food at Banjor, while those in Samukai Town are being </p><p>served in their camp. </p><p> </p><p>10. WFP emphasizes that as long as security remains </p><p>problematic food assistance will remain limited and </p><p>may not target the most in need.

Having just completed their Joint Assessment </p><p>Mission (JAM), WFP and UNHCR expect there will be an </p><p>additional influx of 20,000 Liberian refugees into </p><p>Guinea and an additional influx of 30,000 Liberian </p><p>refugees into Sierra Leone by the end of 2003. </p><p>Additional Liberian refugees are also expected in </p><p>western Cote d\'Ivoire. </p><p> </p><p>12. Any additional needs that surface in Guinea, </p><p>Sierra Leone, or Liberia during 2004 would be </p><p>addressed through activation of the contingency </p><p>provision in the new PRRO, just as WFP activated the </p><p>contingency measure in its 2003 PRRO in February of </p><p>this year for Liberia.  The contingency provision in </p><p>the new PRRO is 150,000 USD for nine months and can </p><p>be utilized in any of the three countries as needs </p><p>arise. </p><p> </p><p>13. Under the Cote d\'Ivoire EMOP, WFP has recently </p><p>addressed the needs of a large influx of Liberian </p><p>refugees that crossed the border into Cote d\'Ivoire </p><p>during June.  WFP opened up an office in Tabou town </p><p>in order to assist the influx and immediately began </p><p>providing 15-day rations.  Last week (July 3-9), WFP </p><p>reported that Nicla refugee camp remains full of arms </p><p>and like the June general food distribution, the July </p><p>distribution witnessed shooting and harassment by </p><p>uncontrolled Liberians present in the camp.  The </p><p>pipeline problems mentioned in paragraph 4 are </p><p>exacerbated by a growing number of beneficiaries. </p><p>Although not yet a major problem among the refugee </p><p>populations in Cote d\'Ivoire, malnutrition rates are </p><p>increasingly worrisome.  Severely malnourished </p><p>children under selected feeding programs by Medecins </p><p>Sans Frontiere and Action Contre La Faim presently </p><p>exceed 1,000. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Next Steps </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>14. WFP views the situation in Liberia as a major </p><p>humanitarian crisis and is building its strategy on </p><p>the premise that basic security conditions will allow </p><p>it to work. Once access is permitted, WFP foresees </p><p>the need for a sizeable intervention for which </p><p>additional resources would be required.  Under the </p><p>best case scenario giving access to new areas, WFP </p><p>intends to open six operational sub-offices: Harper, </p><p>Zwedru, Ganta, Phebe, Tubmanburg and Voinjama. If </p><p>basic security does not exist, its action will be </p><p>limited, given the significant difficulties in </p><p>reaching all intended beneficiaries. </p><p> </p><p>15. A sub-regional contingency planning exercise </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>under the OCHA umbrella is underway.  Various case </p><p>scenarios are being discussed, reports WFP, but was </p><p>unable to provide further details at this time. </p><p>Cross border operations are also being considered </p><p>within the overall access strategy and were broadly </p><p>discussed during the recent UN Humanitarian Inter- </p><p>Agency Mission.  This mission, led by Carolyn </p><p>McAskie, will debrief in Dakar the week of July 14. </p><p> </p><p>16. WFP is in the process of chartering a supply ship </p><p>to be used as a mobile floating office off the coast </p><p>of Monrovia.  A similar ship was used for the same </p><p>purpose during the previous crisis in Monrovia in </p><p>1996.  WFP hopes to have the ship in Abidjan in two </p><p>weeks, where she would load supplies and staff </p><p>(unless the staff are allowed by UNSECOORD to proceed </p><p>to Liberia before the ship arrives), and sail to </p><p>Monrovia.  It would be on hire for an initial period </p><p>of two months.  WFP intends to share the vessel with </p><p>OCHA and UNICEF, however, the accommodation capacity </p><p>is limited to 32 passengers. </p><p> </p><p>17. The following needs are anticipated by WFP: </p><p> </p><p>a) Additional food quantities would be required, </p><p>triggering a budget revision of the current PRRO, and </p><p>perhaps a flash appeal; </p><p> </p><p>b) Chartering the ship to serve as a floating UN </p><p>office for two months, about USD 350,000; </p><p> </p><p>c) Replace logistics equipment that has been looted: </p><p>Trucks. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . about USD 900,000 </p><p>(commercial trucks are not available) </p><p>4x4 Vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .USD 160,000 </p><p>Mobile storage units  . . . . . . . . . .

OCHA is currently the lead agency on IDPs.  WFP </p><p>reports there is a common feeling that OCHA capacity </p><p>needs to be bolstered to address the magnitude of the </p><p>current crisis. </p><p> </p><p>19. Minimize considered.
