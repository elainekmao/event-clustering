NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: INCREASING GOVERNMENT BRUTALIZATION AND TORTURE OF </p><p>POLITICAL OPPONENTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 77 </p><p> </p><p>     B. HARARE 151 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) The Government of Zimbabwe has intensified its </p><p>brutalization of political opponents and is increasing its </p><p>reliance on torture as a means of intimidation.  On January </p><p>16 a court-ordered medical exam revealed that an MDC MP and </p><p>four other MDC members had been tortured while in police </p><p>custody earlier that week.  In response, the prosecutor </p><p>declined to pursue the case against the MDC members, but he </p><p>was threatened by the CIO, and has quietly inquired about </p><p>fleeing to the UK.  This comes amidst a number of other cases </p><p>of beatings and unlawful arrest of high-profile opposition </p><p>figures in the first 3 weeks of the New Year.  Ahead of </p><p>by-elections in Kuwadzana, and the Cricket World Cup, and in </p><p>the midst of crippling food and fuel shortages, the GOZ </p><p>appears determined to demonstrate that it remains firmly in </p><p>control.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>MDC MP Tortured </p><p>--------------- </p><p>2. (C) On January 14 riot police arrested Movement for </p><p>Democratic Change (MDC) MP Job Sikhala, Gabriel Shumba, a </p><p>human rights lawyer in the Public Interest Unit of the Legal </p><p>Resources Foundation (LRF) (a local legal rights NGO), and </p><p>three other MDC members at Nyamutamba Hotel in Chitungwiza. </p><p>Suspected CIO agents held and tortured them for three days. </p><p>Charles Mutama, an MDC member who was tortured alongside </p><p>Sikhala, recounted to Poloff being taken alone on the evening </p><p>of January 15 blindfolded from Harare Central Police Station </p><p>to an undisclosed location about 45 minutes away by car.  He </p><p>was taken inside a 20 by 30 foot room where 8 persons </p><p>interrogated him regarding MDC planned demonstrations, beat </p><p>him with planks, strangled him with wire, attached electrodes </p><p>to his fingers, toes, tongue and genitals and subjected him </p><p>to electric shocks lasting about 20 seconds.  The </p><p>interrogation lasted about 6 hours. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) One interrogator, who was visibly drunk, urinated on </p><p>him before forcing him to lie naked in a puddle of urine with </p><p>a metal bucket over his head as shocks were administered. </p><p>Mutama said he screamed uncontrollably during the shocks, his </p><p>voice changing pitch as the voltage increased.  He said he </p><p>heard Sikhala\'s voice and screams in a neighboring room. </p><p>When the five reconvened two days later each realized he had </p><p>been subjected to similar torture.  Poloff observed burn </p><p>marks on Mutama\'s left 4th finger from the electrode which </p><p>was wrapped around it, and cuts around his neck from the </p><p>strangling. </p><p> </p><p>Torture Medically Confirmed </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) Sikhala wept as he recounted his ordeal in a </p><p>magistrate\'s court on January 15.  By the magistrate\'s order </p><p>the five were examined by a medical doctor, who certified </p><p>they had been tortured.  The five were nevertheless charged </p><p>under the draconian Public Order and Security Act (POSA) with </p><p>planning to overthrow the government, and released on bail of </p><p>US$20.00 (Z$30,000) each.  Though the five must report to </p><p>police weekly, the prosecution reportedly does not intend to </p><p>pursue the case because of the confirmed torture, and for </p><p>lack of evidence. </p><p> </p><p>Public Prosecutor Seeks Asylum </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>5. (C) On January 20 the lead prosecutor in the Office of </p><p>Public Prosecutions in the Ministry of Justice, Thabani </p><p>Mpofu, who prosecuted Job Sikhala recently, and several </p><p>prominent cases against MDC members in the past year, </p><p>approached the British High Commission in Harare seeking </p><p>asylum.  According to a British diplomat Mpofu has been </p><p>informed by friends connected to the CIO several times in the </p><p>past year that parties within CIO would like him eliminated </p><p>for his lack of vigor in prosecuting MDC members.  His </p><p>friends had, up until January 20, advised him that they could </p><p>handle the agitated parties.  On that date, just after MDC MP </p><p>Job Sikhala was released, his friends informed him they could </p><p>no longer hold off the parties interested in his elimination. </p><p> They advised him against going to work or home--he has </p><p>complied.  The British suggested he might consider going to </p><p>South Africa and are making inquiries toward that end. </p><p> </p><p>A Poisoning Pattern </p><p>------------------- </p><p>6. (U) In a public statement, the MDC on January 17 </p><p>complained that several of its members, including Job </p><p>Sikhala, who have been detained by police and suspected CIO </p><p>agents in the past several months have been forced to drink </p><p>unspecified liquids resulting in severe sickness in three </p><p>cases, and death in two cases.  The MDC also noted that </p><p>former MDC MP for Kuwadzana, Harare, Learnmore Jongwe, died </p><p>of chloroquine poisoning while in police custody. </p><p> </p><p>Community Leaders Beaten </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>7. (U) On January 14 ZANU-PF youth militia members detained </p><p>four officials of the Combined Harare Residents Association </p><p>(CHRA)--a USAID grantee--as they were meeting with Harare </p><p>residents.  The four were taken to a nearby room and beaten </p><p>severely with bricks and police style batons for two hours by </p><p>suspected CIO members. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) On January 15 MDC activist Farai Makiwa was abducted </p><p>from Kuwadzana by ZANU- PF militia and beaten at an office at </p><p>the Kuwadzana 5 shopping center. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Officials Arrested </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>9. (U) As reported in Ref A, MDC Executive Mayor of Harare </p><p>Elias Mudzuri was arrested on January 11 and held for 48 </p><p>hours along with 20 other councilors and council officials </p><p>for hosting a public meeting with constituents in Harare. </p><p>Though released, Deputy Mayor Sekesai Makwavara, who suffers </p><p>from high blood pressure, is still recovering from the ordeal </p><p>at home. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) On January 12, MDC MP Paul Madzore was arrested for </p><p>allegedly assaulting two police officers and was beaten while </p><p>in custody.  On January 20, Paul Madzore\'s wife, MDC MP and </p><p>Shadow Minister of Labor, Pauline Mpariwa, was arrested at </p><p>her home in Marimba Park in Harare, held at Harare Central </p><p>Prison for reasons that are still unclear, and released </p><p>without charge 48 hours later. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) On January 2 MDC MP, Abednico Bhebhe, was arrested in </p><p>Bulawayo for putting up posters that read \'Hoot, enough is </p><p>enough\'.  Prosecutors originally sought a conviction under </p><p>the Public Order and Security Act (POSA), claiming the </p><p>activity could have endangered public safety by inciting </p><p>violence.  But they eventually dropped the case, reportedly </p><p>for lack of evidence. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) From January 19 - 21 seven MDC Mashonaland East </p><p>Provincial officials were arrested at their homes.  Among </p><p>them are Jane Chifamba, Provincial Chair for Mashonaland East </p><p>Women\'s Assembly, Sam Kamudarira, the Provincial Youth Chair, </p><p>and Leon Sunday, a member of the province\'s executive </p><p>committee. No charges have been filed against any of the </p><p>seven, who were still being held at Marondera Police Station </p><p>Criminal Investigations Department on January 21. </p><p> </p><p>MDC MP Flees </p><p>------------ </p><p>13. (U) On January 20 the independent Daily News reported </p><p>that MDC MP Tafadzwa Musekiwa fled to the UK saying he had </p><p>specific information that he was on a government hit list </p><p>together with Job Sikhala.  Though he has been in the UK for </p><p>about two months, he reportedly intends to return to Zimbabwe </p><p>soon to prevent the GOZ from calling a by-election for his </p><p>constituency, Zengeza in Harare.  Musekiwa and Sikhala have </p><p>been arrested several times since winning office in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>NGOs Condemn Violence </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>14. (U) In public statements on January 20 - 23 the Legal </p><p>Resources Foundation (LRF), Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human </p><p>Rights, the Human Rights NGO Forum, and the Zimbabwe Election </p><p>Support Network (ZESN) separately condemned the recent </p><p>arrests and tortures and criticized police, particularly the </p><p>Law and Order Section, for their involvement.  In separate </p><p>statements, the organizations called on various parties </p><p>including the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs, the </p><p>Attorney General, the Police Commissioner, the African </p><p>Commission on Human and Peoples\' Rights, and Interpol to </p><p>prosecute the perpetrators, and restore public trust in the </p><p>rule of law and the criminal justice system in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) Commentators and MDC officials have suggested that </p><p>these recent arrests and tortures are part of a GOZ attempt </p><p>to quash government critics and any potential anti-Mugabe </p><p>mass demonstrations in the run-up to the Cricket World Cup in </p><p>Harare in February. </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>16. (C) During the past three years, the Government has </p><p>confined its tactics of physical intimidation / harm </p><p>primarily to little-known figures who have no way of </p><p>defending themselves or of publicizing their victimization. </p><p>The GOZ\'s stepped-up use of torture against higher-profile </p><p>figures is a new and troubling development which suggests an </p><p>increasing concern about domestic pressure, and dwindling </p><p>concern about international opinion. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) The GOZ is likely stepping up its campaign of violent </p><p>intimidation now in response to a confluence of </p><p>circumstances: the approaching Kuwadzana by-election (Ref B), </p><p>the approaching Cricket World Cup, and ordinary peoples\' </p><p>increasing frustration with food and fuel shortages.  The GOZ </p><p>appears determined to demonstrate that even in the face of </p><p>crippling economic and social hardships, it remains firmly in </p><p>control.  ZANU-PF is also demonstrating the intent to </p><p>maintain its policy of "crushing the MDC" through every means </p><p>available.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
