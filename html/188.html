<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 BAGHDAD 00855 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y (PARAGRAPH 3, LAST THREE SENTENCES) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, MOPS, PHUM, PTER, PINR, IZ, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIEWS OF IRANIAN KURDISH LEADER QASSEMLU </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  COMING DOWN OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS FOR ONE </p><p>OF HIS OCCASIONAL TRIPS TO BAGHDAD, IRANIAN KURDISH </p><p>LEADER QASSEMLU MET SADDAM FEBRUARY 10.  QASSEMLU ADMITTED </p><p>THAT INTENSE SHELLING IN THE AREA OF HIS FORMER HEADQUAR- </p><p>TERS (DOWNRIVER FROM THE EMBATTLED TOWN OF MAWAT) HAD </p><p>FORCED HIM RECENTLY TO MOVE 35 KILOMETERS NORTH.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED TO HAVE 10-12,000 ACTIVE FIGHTERS AND THE </p><p>CAPABILITY TO CALL ON MANY MORE AND TO HAVE AMPLE ARMS </p><p>(CAPTURED FROM IRANIANS) AND MONEY (THROUGH SMUGGLING). </p><p>HE MADE AN APPEAL FOR U.S. "MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT," </p><p>NOTING THAT HIS PARTY HAS ALWAYS STRONGLY DISAPPROVED OF </p><p>HOSTAGE-TAKING.  THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR HAS APPROACHED </p><p>HIM ON BEHALF OF KIDNAPPEES HELD BY TALABANI AND HE IS </p><p>HOPEFUL THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO GET THEM FREED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED HIS RELATIONS WITH TALABANI AS </p><p>GOOD, ALTHOUGH HIS POLICY OF STRICT NEUTRALITY BETWEEN </p><p>TALABANI AND THE IRAQIS SOMETIMES CAUSES FRICTION. </p><p>QASSEMLU RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR AN ALLIANCE WITH OTHER </p><p>IRANIAN OPPOSITION GROUPS, BUT RAJAVI--WHOM  HE DESCRIBED </p><p>AS AN "AMATEUR"--SEEMS UNWILLING.  RAJAVI\'S LIMITED </p><p>MILITARY ACTIONS IN THE NORTH COMPLICATED QASSEMLU\'S </p><p>RELATIONS WITH TALABANI, AND RAJAVI WILL NOW MOVE HIS </p><p>EFFORTS SOUTH.  UNLIKE RAJAVI, QASSEMLU AVOIDS EVER </p><p>BEING PHOTOGRAPHED WITH SADDAM.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED THE </p><p>SITUATION IN IRANIAN KURDISTAN AS STABLE, WHILE THE </p><p>SITUATION IN IRAQI KURDISTAN HAS "SHARPLY DETERIORATED" </p><p>(I.E., FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY IN </p><p>BAGHDAD) DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS.  THE IRAQI </p><p>VILLAGE DESTRUCTION CAMPAIGN HAS NOT YET BEEN MIRRORED </p><p>ON A LARGE SCALE IN IRAN.   END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>4.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE 1988 CONGRESS OF THE DEMOCRA- </p><p>TIC PARTY OF KURDISTAN OF IRAN (KDPI), SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>A.R. QASSEMLU (WHO SPELLS HIS NAME GHASSEMLOU) CAME DOWN </p><p>FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO MEET SADDAM HUSSEIN  FEBRUARY 10. </p><p>BECAUSE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF IRANIAN KURDS IN SWEDEN AND </p><p>FRANCE, QASSEMLU TYPICALLY CONTACTS THE SWEDISH AND </p><p>FRENCH AMBASSADORS WHEN HE MAKES TRIPS TO BAGHDAD, EVERY </p><p>FIVE TO SEVEN MONTHS.  POLCHIEF LOBBIED SWEDLSH AMBASSADOR </p><p>THOREN FOR A MEETING WITH QASSEMLU AND WAS INVITEO TO A </p><p>SIX-HOUR LUNCH FEBRUARY 12.  QASSEMLU CAME ACROSS AS EX- </p><p>TREMELY OPEN, SOPHISTICATED, AND ARTICULATE, EVEN IN </p><p>ENGLISH WHICH IS ONLY HIS SIXTH-BEST LANGUAGE (AFTER </p><p>KURDISH, PERSIAN, ARABIC, FRENCH, AND CZECH).  HE WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY THE DIRECTORS OF THE KDPI\'S PARIS, </p><p>STOCKHOLM,  AND BAGHDAD OFFICES (ABDULLAH GHEDERI, </p><p>EBRAHIM DJEURABESKA, AND SALAM AZIZI). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>APPEAL FOR MORAL SUPPORT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  QASSEMLU MADE A STRONG APPEAL FOR AMERICAN "MORAL </p><p>AND POLITICAL SUPPORT."  HE OBSERVED THAT THE KDPI HAS </p><p>ALWAYS HAD A POLICY OF STRONGLY OBJECTING TO TERRORISM </p><p>AND HOSTAGE-TAKING, AND HE PROVIDED POLCHIEF WITH A </p><p>PAPER HE HAD RECENTLY PRESENTED (THROUGH HIS REPRESEN- </p><p>TATIVE) AT A PARIS SYMPOSIUM ON TERRORISM, IN WHICH HE </p><p>OBJECTED TO TERRORISM AS A TOOL FOR REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>LIBERATION GROUPS.  HE CLAIMED TO BE PERPLEXED THAT </p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS RECEIVED "A </p><p>RAGTAG BUNCH OF BACKWARD AFGHAN FUNDAMENTALISTS" AND </p><p>PERSISTS IN TRYING TO BOLSTER "NONVIABLE NICARAGUAN </p><p>GROUPS," WHILE NOT AFFORDING ATTENTION TO "TRUE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC GROUPS" WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR "UNIVERSALLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  POLCHIEF OBSERVED THAT THERE IS PUBLIC SYMPATHY </p><p>FOR THE KURDISH SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES BUT NOT </p><p>VERY MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT IT; QASSEMLU MIGHT DO WELL TO </p><p>CULTIVATE JOURNALISTS.  QASSEMLU SAID THAT ONE OF THE </p><p>THINGS HE HAD DONW WHILE IN BAGHDAD THIS TIME WAS TO </p><p>PUSH THROUGH A VISA FOR THE WASHINGTON POSO\'S  JONATHAN </p><p>RANDAL (PARIS), WHO HE SAID IS WRITING A BOOK ABOUT </p><p>KURDS AND TO WHOM HE HAS GIVEN FOURTEEN HOURS OF </p><p>INTERVIEW.  QASSEMLU LAMENTED THAT "THE SOVIETS ALWAYS </p><p>TEND TO SEE THE KDPI AS SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICANS AND </p><p>THE AMERICANS ALWAYS SUSPECT THE SOVIETS" WHILE IN </p><p>FACT THE KDPI HAS NO FRIENDS.  "OUR ONLY FRIENDS  ARE </p><p>THE MOUNTAINS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ITALIAN HOSTAGES </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  QASSEMLU ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD JUST MET ITALIAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR TOSCANO AND GIVEN HIM A PLEDGE TO DO WHAT HE </p><p>COULD ABOUT THE THREE ITALIAN KIDNAPPEES BEING HELD BY </p><p>TALABANI\'S PATRIOTIC UNION OF KURDISTAN (PUK).  HE </p><p>NOTED THAT HE HAD INTERVENED OCCASIONALLY IN THE PAST, </p><p>HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN INFLUENCING TALABANI TO RELEASE </p><p>HOSTAGES, AND HE "HAD EVERY CONFIDENCE" THAT HE WOULD </p><p>BE SUCCESSFUL AGAIN. (HE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THS </p><p>WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE ITALIANS HAD APPROACHED HIM </p><p>AND THUS HE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY MADE ANY EFFORTS </p><p>ON THE CIVILIAN\'S BEHALF.)  QASSEMLU BETRAYED A TRACE OF </p><p>ANNOYANCE THAT OTHER GROUPS\' WILLINGNESS TO RESORT TO </p><p>TERRORISM HAD GAINED THEM GREATER ATTENTION THAN THAT </p><p>GIVEN THE KDPI, EVEN THOUGH THE KDPI, HE CLAIMED, IS </p><p>A "MUCH MORE FIRMLY AND WIDELY BASED ORGANIZATION." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>KDPI BASE OF SUPPORT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  QASSEMLU SAID THAT HE HAS 10-12,000 ACTIVE FIGHTERS </p><p>AND "CANNOT HANDLE" ANY MORE THAN THAT FOR LOGISTICAL </p><p>JEXNSJM  WHENEVER HE NEEDS, HE CAN CALL UP "SEVERAL </p><p>MULTIPLES" OF THAT FIGURE.  HE CLAIMED THAT HE HAS NO </p><p>REAL COMPETITION FOR INFLUENCE AMONG IRANIAN KURDS </p><p>("80 PERCENT ARE BEHIND ME") AND HE SCOFFED AT THE </p><p>SITUATION IN IRAQ:  "THERE IS NOTHING SIMILAR IN IRAN </p><p>TO A (KURDISH) TAHA MA\'RUF AS \'VICE PRESIDENT\' OR THE </p><p>KURDS THAT HOLD MINISTRIES HERE.  THERE IS NOTHING </p><p>LIKE THE HUGE NUMBERS OF \'JAHASH\'" (THE PEJORATIVE </p><p>TERM FOR THE KURDISH TRIBAL FORCES HELD BY VHENIRAIE </p><p>(##) --AND THUS BECOME SOMETHING EQUIVALENT TO THE </p><p>"JAHASH."). </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN HIS APPEAL FOR AMERICAN "MORAL AND POLITICAL </p><p>SUPPORT," QASSEMLU STRESSED THAT HE WAS NOT CALLING </p><p>FOR MONEY OR ARMS.  "OF COURSE ONE ALWAYS LIKES MORE, </p><p>BUT WE HAVE PLENTY."  HE CLAIMED THAT THE KDPI HAS, </p><p>OVER THE YEARS, BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE AMPLE ARMS FROM </p><p>THE IRANIAN URMY/PASDARAN.  HE WAS RELUCTANT TO GO INTO </p><p>HIS FINANCIAL SOURCES, CLAIMING ONLY THAT "EVERY FAMILY </p><p>IN KURDISTAN MAKES VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS," BUT IN THE </p><p>COURSE OF CONVERSATION IT BECAME CLEAR THAT BOTH THE </p><p>KDPI AND PUK SUSTAIN THEMSELVES IN LARGE PART THROUGH </p><p>SMUGGLING.  QASSEMLU SAID THAT HE "ONLY" CJARGES A </p><p>"THREE PERCENT DUTY" ON GOODS PASSING FROM IRAQ INTO </p><p>IRAN, AS OPPOSED TO "AS MUCH AS TWENTY PERCENT" LEVIED </p><p>BY TALABANI.  EXAMPLES OF GOODS GOING INTO IRAN </p><p>INCLUDE WHISKEY AND VIDEOS AND OF GOODS GOING INTO </p><p>IRAQ, CARPETS AND PISTACHIOS.  FORMERLY TEA CAME FROM </p><p>IRAQ AND SUGAR FROM IRAN, BUT LATELY BOTH TEA AND </p><p>SUGAR HAVE BEEN MOVING FROM IRAQ INTO IRAN.  QASSEMLU </p><p>SAID THAT HE HAD RECENTLY ASKED TALABANI HOW LONG HE </p><p>COULD SURVIVE FINANCIALLY IF HIS MONETARY SOURCES </p><p>SUDDENLY DRIED UP, AND TALABANI SAID, "TWO MONTHS," </p><p>WHEREAS QASSEMLU CLAIMED HE WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY </p><p>GOING ON FOR "AT LEAST TWO YEARS." </p><p> </p><p>10.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN IRANIAN </p><p>KURDISTAN AS "STABLE," I.E., MUCH THE SAME AS IT HAS </p><p>XBEEN FINCE 1980 WHEN THE KDPI LOST ITS CONTROL OVER </p><p>THE CITIES AND CHANGED FROM CONVENTIONAL WARFARE TO </p><p>GUERRILLA TACTICS.  THE IRANIANS CONTROL THE CITIES </p><p>VNOW BUT ONLY CONTROL THE MAIN HIGHWAYS FROM EIGHT TO </p><p>FVE; TE KDPI TACES OVER AT NIGHT.  QASSEMLU PRO\' </p><p>XFESSED TO BE "OPTIMISTIC" ABOUT THE FUTURE, SINCE HIS </p><p>SUPPORT IN IRANIN KURDISTAN IS "ROCK-SOLID."  HE SAID </p><p>THAT HE ISHPREPARED TO HOLD OUT IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR </p><p>25 YEARS, BUT IF KHOMEINI DIES SOON "THERE MAY BE </p><p>CONSIDERABLE TURMOIL IN TEHRAN," AND THE IRANIAN </p><p>ECONOMY IS "IN A TAILSPIN."  WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE </p><p>OR TALABANI AND BARZANI CONTROLLED MORE TERRAIN, </p><p>QASSEMLU SAID THAT THREE YEARS AGO HE DID, BUT NOW </p><p>THE IRAQI KURDS DO.  THE REASON, HE EXPLAINED, IS </p><p>NOT THAT HE IS DOING WORSE--TO THE CONTRARY HE IS </p><p>HLDING HIS OWN--IT IS RATHER THAT THE SITUATION FOR </p><p>THE BAGHDAD REGIME IN IRAQI KURDISTAN HAS "DETERIOKA- </p><p>TED SO SHARPLY" OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. (#) </p><p>CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING </p><p>TALABAMI AND SADDAM TOGETHER FOR PROLONGED NEGOTIA- </p><p>TIOS TH YEARS AGO, WHICH BROKE DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>COMPELLED TO MOVE HEADPUARTERS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  QASSEMLU ADMITTED THAT HE HAD RECENTLY BEEN OBLIGED </p><p>TO MOVE HIS HEADQUARTERS.BECAUSE OF INTENSE IRANIAN </p><p>SHELLING.  HIS FORMER HEADQUARTERS--HE POINTED OUT ON AN </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY NOT VERY DETAILED MAP--APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN NEAR THE LESSER ZAB RIVER WHERE IT FLOWS INTO IRAQ </p><p>(APPROXIMATELY 3601N 4520E).  HE HAD HAD A LARGE HOSPI- </p><p>TAL TYERE TO WHICH FRENCH DOCTORS CAME EVERY MONTH, AND </p><p>OFTEN THE KDPI WAS PUT IN THE ANOMOLOUS SITUATION OF </p><p>HAVING BOTH TALABANI AND IRAQI ARMY CASUALTIES AT THE </p><p>HOSPITAL AT THE SAME TIME.  THE LOCALS BECAME UNTENABLE </p><p>BECAUSE THE IRANIAN ARMY WAS JUST TO THE EAST, THE IRAQI </p><p>ARMY JUST TO THE WEST, AND TALABANI\'S FORCES BEHIND THE </p><p>IRAQI ARMY FURTHER TO THE WEST--"EVERYBODY WAS POUNDING </p><p>EVERYBODY."  NOW HE HAS MOVED TO A POINT (APPROXIMATELY </p><p>3620N 4515E) SOME THIRTY-FIVE KILOMETERS TO THE NORTH, </p><p>AGAIN RIGHT ON THE IRANIAN BORDER SO THAT QASSEMLU </p><p>SPENDS MUCH OF HIS TIME ON THE IRANIAN SIDE (HE CLAIMS), </p><p>BUT WHERE THE IRAQI ARMY IS MUCH FURTHER AWAY TO ZHE </p><p>WEST.  THUS, HIS HEADQUARTERS NOW APPEARS TO BE IN A </p><p>KIND OF NO-MAN\'S-LAND WHERE THE KDPI HAS FULL SWAY. </p><p>HE SAYS HE HAS REBUILT THE HOSPITAL THERE AND THE </p><p>FRENCH DOCTORS CONTINUE TO COME. </p><p> </p><p>12.  ON FIGHTING AT MAWAT ON THE GOGASUR RIVER JUST TO </p><p>THE SOUTH OF WHERE HIS FORMER HEADQUARTERS WAS, QASSEMLU </p><p>SAID THAT THE IRANIAN OBJECTIVE IS TO CLEAR TALABANI\'S </p><p>EAST-WEST ACCESS.  TALABANI\'S HEADQUARTERS, HE CLAIMED, </p><p>IS LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF MAWAT (SOMEWHERE VAGUELY IN THE </p><p>VALLEY OF THE SHILER RIVER WHICH MEETS THE GOGASUR </p><p>SOUTH OF MAWAT, APPROXIMATELY AT 3547N 4540E).  THE </p><p>IRANIANS CONTROL THE RIDGE OVERLOOKING MAWAT TO THE EAST, </p><p>THE IRAQIS CONTROL THE HILLS SOUTHWEST OF MAWAT, AND </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN MUCH FIGHTING THERE AND IN THE MOUNTAIN </p><p>WEST OF MAWAT WHICH THE IRANIANS PARTIALLY CONTROL. </p><p>JUST THAT MORNING QASSEMLU RECEIVED A CALL FROM HIS </p><p>HEADQUARTERS THAT THE IRAQIS HAD JUST LAUNCHED A NEW </p><p>ATTACK ON THE IRANIAN POSITIONS WEST OF MAWAT.  MAWAT </p><p>ITSELF, "LIKE PANJWIN," QASSEMLU COMMENTED, IS </p><p>COMPLETELY ABANDONED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>RELATIONS WITH TALABANI </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  QASSEMLU CLAIMED TO BE "VERY GOOD FRIENDS" WITH </p><p>TALABANI.  RECENTLY HE HAD ASKED TALABANI TO PICK UP </p><p>SOME CAVIAR FOR HIM FROM THE CASPIAN, AND WHEN TALABANI </p><p>BROUGHT IT TO HIM HE JOKED THAT HE HAD HAD TO GO </p><p>THROUGH SPECIAL CHANNELS TO GET MORE CAVIAR THAN IS NOW </p><p>USUALLY PERMITTED AND IF THE IRANIAN AUTHORITIES HAD </p><p>KNOWN WHOM IT WAS FOR "THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN APOPLECTIC." </p><p>QASSEMLU ADMITTED THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN DELICATE </p><p>ISSUES ARISE.  FOR EXAMPLE, RECENTLY 52 IRAQI SOLDIERS, </p><p>INCLUDING SIX OFFICERS, HAD TAKEN REFUGE WITH THE KDPI </p><p>AND TALABANI HAD DEMANDED THAT THEY BE HANDED OVER. </p><p>THE DISPUTE WENT ON FOR TWO WEEKS BUT QASSEMLU WAS </p><p>ADAMANT THAT THE KDPI MUST REMAIN "ABSOLUTELY NEUTRAL" </p><p>IN ALL MATTERS BETWEEN IRAQIS AND KURDS, AND HE EVENTU- </p><p>ALLY HANDED THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS BACK TO THE </p><p>IRAQI ARMY.  QASSEMLU, WHO WHILE BEING REMARKABLY OPEN </p><p>ALSO TENDED TO CHOOSE HIS WORDS CAREFULLY, WAS UNWILL- </p><p>ING TO BE DRAWN OUT ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>MAS\'UD BARZANI, BUT HE RIDICULED THE IDEA THAT THE </p><p>BARZANIS\' "KDP" WAS EVER "A REAL PARTY."  "THEY ARE </p><p>MERELY A TRIBE." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>SADDAM IS IN CHARGE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  QASSEMLU WAS UNWILLING TO DISCUSS HIS MEETING WLTH </p><p>SADDAM, INDEED EVEN DIRECTLY TO ADMIT IT TOOK PLACE </p><p>(ALTHOUGH PRIVATELY TO THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR HE HAD </p><p>BEEN MORE CANDID), ALTHOUGH HE DID ALLUDE TO THE </p><p>PERSIAN SAYING THAT "IF YOU CAN MEET GOD, THERE IS NO </p><p>POINT IN SETTLING FOR ONE OF THE TWELVE IMAMS." </p><p>QASSEMLU SAID THAT, UNLIKE MUJAHEDIN E-KHALQ LEADER </p><p>RAJAVI, HE HAD "ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE" TO BE PHOTO- </p><p>GRAPHED WITH SADDAM OR HAVE ANY PUBLICITY OF HIS TRAVEL </p><p>TO BAGHDAD, MUCH LESS OF MEETING SADDAM--"IT DOES NOT </p><p>GO OVER VERY WELL IN IRAN."  POLCHIEF PRESSED HIM ON </p><p>WHO IN IRAQ IS IN CHARGE OF KURDISH ISSUES, AND </p><p>QASSEMLU SAID, "SADDAM.  HE IS IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING." </p><p>THAT ASIDE, HOWEVER, HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT IN DAY-TO- </p><p>DAY AFFAIRS, "THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN IRAQ: </p><p>SADDAM; \'ADNAN (KHAYRALLAH, MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND </p><p>FIRST COUSIN AND BGOTHER-IN-LAW OF SADDAM), WHO IS IN </p><p>CHARGE OF THE SOUTH; AND \'ALI HASAN (AL-MAJID, PATER- </p><p>NAL COUSIN AND LOOK-ALIKE OF SAWAAV0| WHO IS IN UHAR3 </p><p>RGFITHE NORTH."  HOWEVER, QASSEMLU INDICATED HE DID NOT </p><p>SEE \'ALI HASAN, HEADQUARTERED IN KIRKUK, VERY OFTEN, </p><p>APPARENTLY BECAUSE QASSEMLU NEVER SETTLES FOR LESS </p><p>THAN "GOD." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>VILLAGE DESTRUCTION </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  POLCHIEF ASKED QASSEMLU FOR HIS REACTION TO THE </p><p>IRAQI CAMPAIGN OF DESTROYING KURDISH VILLAGES. </p><p>QASSEMLU ACKNOWLEDGED THAT "MOST" VILLAGES HAVE BEEN </p><p>DESTROYED BUT HE SEEMED UNEMOTIONAL ON THE POINT. </p><p>POLCHIEF ASKED IF THE CAMPAIGN HAD HAD THE EFFECT OF </p><p>INCREASING THE NUMBER OF GUERRILLAS AND REFUGEES.  HE </p><p>ANSWERED THAT IT HAD "GREATLY" INCREASED THE NUMBER </p><p>OF UERRILLAS BUT NEITHER HE NOR TALABANI ENCOURAGED </p><p>THE IDEA OF REFUGEES INTO THE OTHER\'S TERRITORY, </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN FEEDING AND CARING </p><p>FOR PEOPLE.  THE NET EFFECT OF THE IRAQI VILLAGE DES- </p><p>TRUCTION CAMPAIGN, HE ACKNOWLEDGED, IS THE ALMOST </p><p>COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF THE IRAQI KURDS\' TRADITIONAL </p><p>AGRARIAN WAY OF LIFE.  KURDISH MEN IN IRAQ HAVE </p><p>ONLY TWO CHOICES, TO GO TO THE CITIES OR TO STAY: IN </p><p>NEWLY CONSTRUCTED CENTERS WHERE THE ONLY LIVELIHOOD IS </p><p>TO BE "JAHASH."  QASSEMLU SAID THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE </p><p>SO FAR ONLY DESTROYED 25 VILLAGES, OUT OF OVER SEVEN </p><p>THOUSAND IN IRANIAN KURDISTAN (AND A CLAIMED KURDISH </p><p>POPULATION IN IRAN OF SEVEN MILLION), BUT HE COMMENTED, </p><p>"ALAS, EACH SIDE TENDS TO LEARN BAD HABITS FROM THE </p><p>OTHER."   ONE BAD HABIT THAT HE CLAIMED THE IRANIANS </p><p>HAVE (#) IS THE USE OF CHEMICUL WEAPONS.  "BOTH </p><p>SIDES DO IT, ALTHOUGH THE IRAQIS MUCH MORE."  POLCHIEF </p><p>ASKED WHETHER, GIVEN THE DENUDED NATURE OF MOST OF </p><p>KURDISTAN, HELICOPTERS AND OTHER AIRBORNE ATTACKS POSE </p><p>A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE PESHMERGA.  QASSEMLU SAID, </p><p>"NEITHER WE NOR THE IRAQI KURDS ARE WORRIED ABOUT </p><p>HELICOPTERS.  WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THEM.  BUT ARTILLERY </p><p>IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR US.  AND CHEMICAL WARFARE IS </p><p>A PROBLEM TOO." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>A KURD\'S VIEW OF IRAQ </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  QASSEMLU DID NOT GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO CRITICIZE IRAQ, </p><p>BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST A BARRAGE OF CUTTING REMARKS THAT </p><p>CLEARLY SHOWED HIS DISDAIN FOR ARABS AND FOR THE IRAQI </p><p>REGIME.  IN PARTICULAR, HE SAID THAT HE VERY MUCH DISLIKED </p><p>BAGHDAD AND AVOIDED COMING UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. </p><p>HE GRUDGINGLY ADMITTED THAT IRAN IS A MORE FLUID AND </p><p>DYNAMIC SOCIETY--"YES, IN URMIA PEBPLE CAN PICKIUP THE </p><p>PHONE TO THE UNITED STATES ANY TIME THEY WANT, AND THEY </p><p>ARE FREE TO TRAVEL OUT OF THE COUNTRY," HE SAID WISTFULLY </p><p>--BUT HE WAS QUICK TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE IS MUCH LESS </p><p>INTERFERENCE IN PEOPLE\'S PRIVATE MORALS IN IRAQ AND THAT </p><p>IRAQ STANDS FOR "MORE MODERN IDEAS."  HE HAD DETESTED THE </p><p>SHAH, "BUT KHOMEINI IS MUCH WORSE."  HE HAD SEEN KHOMEINI </p><p>TWICE IN 1979 AND BEEN "LIED TO SHAMELESSLY."  QASSEMLU </p><p>PROCEEDED TO GIVE A LECTURE ON THE SHI\'A PRACTICE OF </p><p>"TAQIYA" (DECEIT TO SERVE A HIGHER PURPOSE) AS AN </p><p>PNGRAINED PART OF THE SHI\'A PERSONALITY; POLCHIEF NOTED </p><p>THAT WE HAD RECENTLY LEARNED A FEW LDSSONS ON THE SUBJECT </p><p>OURSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>RAJAVI </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  QASSEMLU ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE KDPI IS IN NEED OF </p><p>ALLIANCES WITH OTHER IRANIAN OPVBSITION GROUPS, SINCE </p><p>BY ITSELF IT OBVIOUSLY CANNOT OVERTHROW THE REGIME.  HE </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THE REGIME HAS WIDE SUVPORT ("HUNDREDS OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF MULLAHS WHO ALL SEE THEIR LIVELIHOOD AT </p><p>STAKE") AND ITS OVERTHROW WILL BE NO EASY MATTER.  POL- </p><p>CHIEF ASKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE ALLIANCE WITH RAJAVI WHO, </p><p>IN ANY CASE, HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN  MOUNTING MILITARY </p><p>ACTIONS IN THE NORTH.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED RAJAVI AS </p><p>AN "AMATEUR," WHO HAS 1200 FIGHTERS "AT THE MOST" BUT </p><p>HAS A GOOD PROPAGANDA MACHINE.  HE ADMITTED THAT RAJAVI </p><p>"HAD TRIED A FEW ACTIONS IN THE NORTH," BUT UNLIKE THE </p><p>KDPI THE MUJAHEDIN E-KHALQ "HAVE NO REAL STRENGTH IN </p><p>PLACE IN IRAN."  "IN FACT, OF ALL THE OPPOSITION GROUPS," </p><p>QASSEMLU CLAIMED, "ONLY MY PARTY HAS SIGNIFICANT STRENGTH </p><p>INSIDE IRAN."   QASSEMLU SAID THATSRAJAVI\'S RECENT </p><p>ACTIONS IN THE NORTH HAD CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR THE KDPI, </p><p>BECAUSE IT HAD ON OCCASION ENGAGED TALABANI\'S FORCES. </p><p>QASSEMLU SAID THAT HENCEFORTH RAJAVI WILL NOT BE </p><p>OPERATING IN THE NORTH BUT HAS NOW SWITCHED TO THE </p><p>SOUTH.  HE ADMITTED THAT RAJAVI "IS APPARENTLY NOT EAGER </p><p>FOR ANY ALLIANCES."  "RAJAVI HAS VISIONS OF GRANDEUR; </p><p>HE THINKS HE IS ABLE TO CARRY IT BY HIMSELF." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>KDPI CONGRESS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  IN AN ASIDE, THE KDPI PARIS REPRESENTATIVE (WHO </p><p>WITH HIS COLLEAGUE IN STOCKHOLM WAS TO RETURN TO </p><p>EUROPE FEBRUARY 15) SAID THAT "APPROXIMATELY 200" </p><p>PARTY REPRESENTATIVES HAD APPEARED FOR THE CONGRESS, </p><p>HELD AT THE NEW PARTY HEADQUARTERS.  THE CONGRESS HAD </p><p>ALWAYS PREVIOUSLY BEEN BIENNIAL, BUT BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>ENORMOUS DIFFICULTIES FACED BY MANY OF THE PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS IN MAKING THE JOURNEY FROM OUTLYING PARTS OF </p><p>IRANIAN KURDISTAN OVER THE BORDER TO THE HEADQUARTERS </p><p>IN IRAQ, IT HAS NOW BEEN DECIDED NOT TO HAVE THE NEXT </p><p>CONGRESS FOR THREE YEARS.  QASSEMLU, WHILE REPEATEDLY </p><p>STRESSING THE DEMOCRATIC NATURE OF HIS PARTY AND ITS </p><p>POLICIES  (AND HE CLARIFIED THAT HE MEANT "DEMOCRATIC" </p><p>IN THE WESTERN RATHER THAN EASTERN SENSE), ADMITTED </p><p>THAT HE HAD HAD NO OPPONENT FOR POSITION OF SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL.  POLCHIEF ASKED WHETHER ANY KDPI REPRESENTA- </p><p>TIVES FROM THE U.S. HAD PARTICIPATED, AND THE REPLY </p><p>WAS THAT WHILE ONE HAD ATTENDED THE PREVIOUS CONGRESS, </p><p>NONE CAME THIS  TIME. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>KOMALA </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>19.  THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR DISPLAYED CONSTERNATION </p><p>THAT TWO WEEKS AGO HE HAD GIVEN A PROMINENT IRANIAN </p><p>KURDISH FIGURE, SHAYH \'IZZ AL-DIN HUSAYNI, A TOURIST </p><p>VISA TO SWEDEN, AND NOW HE IS ASKING FOR ASYLUM.  THE </p><p>VISA HAD BEEN REQUESTED ON HIS BEHALF BY HIS SON-IN-LAW, </p><p>NAMED CHAMSI, THE BAGHDADREPRESENTATIVE OF KOMALA </p><p>(SMALL MARXIST IRANIAN KURDISH GROUP).  QASSDMLU </p><p>DISCOUNTED SHAYKH HUSAYNI\'S RELIGIOUS IMPBRTANCE AND </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF KOMALA. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>BIOGRAPHICS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  QASSEMLU (GHASSEMLOU) WAS BORN IN 1930.  HIS EARLY </p><p>EDUCATION WAS IN URMIA BUT HE ALSO ATTENDED THE AMERICAN </p><p>COLLEGE IN TEHRAN.  HE WENT TO UNIVERSITY IN PARIS BUT </p><p>WAS EXPELLED FROM IRAN (#) REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES. </p><p>HE WON A SCHOLARSHIP AT THE UNIVERSITY IN PRAGUE, AND HE WAS </p><p>AN ECONOMICS PROFESSOR IN PRAGUE FOR TWENTY YEARS.  HE </p><p>DEPARTED WHEN THE SOVIETS MARCHED IN IN 1968.  OFF AND </p><p>ON DURING THE 1970S HE SERVED AS AN ECONOMIST IN THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PLANNING IN BAGHDAD, DURING WHICH HE </p><p>AUTHORED A MAJOR OVERALL ECONOMIC PLAN FOR IRAQ, HE </p><p>CLAIMS.  OF MEDIUM HEIGHT AND SLENDER BUILD, HIS HAIR </p><p>IS GRAYING BUT HE MOVES WITH THE QUICKNESS AND AGILITY </p><p>OF A YOUNGER MAN.  HE TELLS A GOOD ANECDOTE AND PEPPERS </p><p>HIS CONVERSATION WITH CONSTANT HUMOR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWTON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOTE BY OC/T:  (#):  OMISSION:  PARA 20 LINE 4.
