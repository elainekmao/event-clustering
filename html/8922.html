<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001450 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KTIA, YM, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S BOLTON 6/16-17 VISIT TO YEMEN: ARTICLE 98 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 STATE 84875 B. SANAA 1263 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ALAN G. MISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:   ROYG Foreign Minister al-Qirbi pledged his </p><p>support for an Article 98 agreement with the U.S. during the </p><p>June 16-17 visit of U/S Bolton.  On timing, President Saleh </p><p>was equivocal, suggesting that Yemen would not sign until a </p><p>specified list of other Arab states were on board. According </p><p>to the Foreign Minister, Saleh later agreed that Yemen would </p><p>join "some" other Arab signatories by exchanging diplomatic </p><p>notes (on the Egyptian model).  Al-Qirbi estimates the </p><p>Ministry of Legal Affairs will take six to eight weeks to </p><p>complete preparations for the notes. Parliamentary </p><p>ratification of the Rome statute, which Yemen signed in 2002, </p><p>will not come until some time later in the year. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Article 98: Important to America </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During his June 16-17 visit to Yemen (septels), Under </p><p>Secretary John Bolton pressed Foreign Minister Abu Bakr </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>al-Qirbi on the urgent need to sign an Article 98 agreement </p><p>with the U.S.  Explaining the importance of the issue to the </p><p>American people, as well as the Administration, U/S Bolton </p><p>assured the Minister that Article 98 is not meant to provide </p><p>immunity for American citizens accused of serious crimes. In </p><p>such circumstances, U.S. courts would provide immediate and </p><p>vigorous prosecution.  The International Criminal Court, in </p><p>contrast, risks becoming politicized and thus losing both </p><p>credibility and effectiveness. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  U/S Bolton reminded the Foreign Minister that Egypt, </p><p>Djibouti, and Bahrain had already signed Article 98 </p><p>agreements, and Kuwait was about to do so.  Yemen should join </p><p>them as soon as possible.  A team of experienced U.S. </p><p>negotiators would be ready to assist with any ROYG questions. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Endorsing the Agreement </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>4.  Al-Qirbi agreed on the importance of concluding an </p><p>Article 98 agreement, having studied the issue for some time. </p><p>His staff had recently completed a report on Article 98, </p><p>recommending an exchange of diplomatic notes, rather than a </p><p>bilateral treaty that would require parliamentary approval. </p><p>Al-Qirbi promised U/S Bolton to refer that report, with his </p><p>endorsement, to the Ministry of Legal Affairs for action. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>President Saleh: Bargaining on Numbers </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  President Ali Abdullah Saleh seemed less forthcoming </p><p>during his Article 98 discussions with U/S Bolton.  Saleh </p><p>said he wanted to see his GCC neighbors and a number of other </p><p>Arab states on board before Yemen signed. His list of </p><p>countries which must act before Yemen included the GCC </p><p>countries, Egypt, Djibouti, Jordan Morocco, Tunisia, and </p><p>Mauritania.   Half-jokingly, he proposed that the U.S. commit </p><p>$100 million in development aid if it needed Yemen\'s </p><p>immediate agreement. </p><p> </p><p>6. U/S Bolton reminded Saleh that it was politically </p><p>important for Yemen to sign an agreement as soon as possible. </p><p> Other Arab States had either signed already, or were in the </p><p>process of concluding agreements; Yemen should not wait for </p><p>the last minute. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Yemeni Timetable: Six to Eight Weeks </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  In a follow-up meeting on June 18 with Charge, FM </p><p>al-Qirbi said he had reviewed U/S Bolton\'s visit with ROYG </p><p>President Saleh.  Saleh had agreed in principle to an Article </p><p>98 signing, as long as "some" other Arab states were already </p><p>enrolled.   With this presidential green light, Qirbi </p><p>estimated that the Ministry of Legal Affairs would take six </p><p>to eight weeks to prepare for the exchange of notes. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The Charge welcomed al-Qirbi\'s assurances, and again </p><p>stressed the need for Yemen to conclude an agreement as soon </p><p>as possible.  Rather than waiting for other Arab states to </p><p>act, Yemen should lead.  Al-Qirbi quipped that leadership is </p><p>costly in the Middle East, but Yemen would proceed.   Charge </p><p>asked the Foreign Minister to follow the issue personally, </p><p>and promised to supply any information required by the </p><p>Ministry of Legal Affairs.  He stressed that the exact </p><p>wording of the text is very important and should follow the </p><p>successful models already in force to prevent unnecessary </p><p>delay. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Qirbi concluded by noting that Yemen\'s formal </p><p>ratification of the Rome Statute was "months away."  It had </p><p>been referred to the Yemeni Parliament for ratification </p><p>immediately after signing.  However, with the seating of the </p><p>new parliament and government following the April 2003 </p><p>elections, the ratification process would have to begin again </p><p>as new business. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Comment:  FM Qirbi\'s timeline  - six to eight weeks for </p><p>Legal Affairs to complete preparations for the exchange of </p><p>diplomatic notes - is potentially achievable, given President </p><p>Saleh\'s nod of approval and the number of Arab states now </p><p>lined up for signature.  We will prod the ROYG on Article 98 </p><p>progress at every opportunity, and provide whatever </p><p>information resources are needed to speed the work. End </p><p>Comment </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
