HE DESCRIBED RANKO AS TALL AND </p><p>MUSCULAR, WITH BLACK HAIR; AND MONIKA AS 18 OR 19 YEARS </p><p>OLD, SHORT, NICE-LOOKING, WITH BLACK SHOULDER-LENGTH </p><p>HAIR.

UPON </p><p>DISEMBARKING FROM THE BUSSES, THE PRISONERS HAD TO ENTER </p><p>THE CAMP BETWEEN TWO ROWS OF "CETNIKS" WITH CLUBS, WHO </p><p>BEAT THEM.  IN THE WAREHOUSE, THE EARLIER ARRIVALS WERE </p><p>LYING FACE DOWN, THEIR HANDS BEHIND THEIR HEADS AND THEIR </p><p>HEADS SHAVED.

(U) SOME PRISONERS DIED FROM THE DAILY BEATINGS IN </p><p>THE CAMP.  OFTEN, SOLDIERS RETURNING FROM THE FRONT WOULD </p><p>BE BROUGHT IN TO BEAT THE PRISONERS.  CERTAIN PEOPLE WERE </p><p>SINGLED OUT FOR THE WORST BEATINGS, INCLUDING A SOLDIER </p><p>NAMED NEDIM.  FOOD WAS VERY BAD, WITH ONLY ONE KILO OF </p><p>BREAD FOR 15 PERSONS, AND A FEW SPOONSFUL OF THIN CABBAGE </p><p>SOUP.  THERE WAS NO MEDICAL CARE, AND SOME OF THE OLD AND </p><p>SICK DIED AS A RESULT.  THE OLDEST MAN THE WITNESS KNEW </p><p>IN THE CAMP WAS BORN IN 1911.  ON THE HOTTEST DAYS, </p><p>PRISONERS WERE LOCKED UP IN THE WAREHOUSES, WHERE THE </p><p>HEAT WAS UNBEARABLE; TWO OR THREE PRISONERS WITH HEART </p><p>PROBLEMS DIED AS A RESULT. </p><p> </p><p>10.
