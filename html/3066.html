The government of Robert Mugabe refused to re-new </p><p>    the broadcast license of semi-independent television </p><p>    broadcaster "Joy TV" and the station ceased operations </p><p>    on May 31.  The following report from the Zimbabwe </p><p>    office of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) </p><p>    offers an accurate summary of the sad case of Joy TV. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>CURTAIN COMES DOWN ON JOY TV </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s privately owned broadcasting station, Joy </p><p>TV, started in July 1998, closed down on 31 May 2002, </p><p>bringing down the curtain on Zimbabwe\'s botched </p><p>experiment with broadcasting diversity and carrying the </p><p>same dream down with it. </p><p> </p><p>Joy TV closed down after a lease agreement it had with </p><p>the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) was </p><p>canceled on the grounds that Joy TV had violated the </p><p>Broadcasting Services Act that was enacted in 2001. </p><p>Joy TV was leasing ZBC\'s second station, generally </p><p>known as TV 2. </p><p> </p><p>The closure of Joy TV leaves the state-controlled ZBC </p><p>as the sole broadcasting voice in Zimbabwe. Although </p><p>the Broadcasting Services Act was enacted in 2001, </p><p>purportedly to regulate the entry of other players into </p><p>the industry, no private station has been licensed to </p><p>date.  The ZBC therefore maintains its "monopoly". </p><p> </p><p>The short but eventful life of Joy TV faced stern </p><p>challenges, especially direct interference from the </p><p>government.  This manifested itself in a direct order </p><p>for the station to drop the BBC news bulletin it </p><p>broadcast everyday.  Joy TV was also never allowed to </p><p>produce local news except musicals and apolitical </p><p>documentaries.  The station\'s reliance on the ZBC for </p><p>transmission was a contributing factor to its demise. </p><p>The government could switch it off at any time, </p><p>effectively preventing Joy TV from producing any </p><p>programming that challenged the status quo. </p><p> </p><p>The closure of Joy TV underscores the need to license </p><p>other players to enter the broadcasting industry.  MISA- </p><p>Zimbabwe believes the Broadcasting Act needs major </p><p>amendments if private players are to survive in the </p><p>industry. </p><p> </p><p>The government has largely ignored the calls to amend </p><p>the Act, which makes it virtually impossible for </p><p>private players to enter the industry.  Among the many </p><p>blemishes in the Act are the prohibition on foreign </p><p>investment in the broadcasting industry and the </p><p>requirement that broadcasters adhere to a strictly </p><p>defined programme content. </p><p>End text. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
