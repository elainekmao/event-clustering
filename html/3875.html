(U) SUMMARY.  GVN OFFICIALS CHARACTERIZED THE FOURTH </p><p>ASIA-EUROPEAN MEETING (ASEM) AS A "SUCCESS."  VIETNAM\'S MAIN </p><p>GOAL WAS TO ADVANCE ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH ITS EUROPEAN </p><p>PARTNERS.  VIETNAM SUPPORTED THE DECLARATION ON COOPERATION </p><p>ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM BUT LIKELY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED </p><p>LANGUAGE ON RESOLVING THE "ROOT CAUSES."    PRIME MINISTER </p><p>PHAN VAN KHAI, WHO REPRESENTED VIETNAM, ALSO VISITED </p><p>ICELAND, BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG, AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN </p><p>CONJUNCTION WITH THE ASEM MEETING.  VIETNAM WILL HOST ASEM V </p><p>IN 2004, AND HOPES FOR PARTICIPATION BY AT LEAST TWO MORE </p><p>ASEAN MEMBERS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL EUROPEAN STATES.

NGUYEN QUANG THUAN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>CENTER FOR EUROPEAN STUDIES OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR </p><p>SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES OF VIETNAM, DESCRIBED THE </p><p>2002 ASEM AS A "KEY OPPORTUNITY FOR VIETNAM TO PUSH ITS </p><p>ECONOMIC AGENDA OF INCREASING TRADE WITH EUROPE."

(SBU)  MFA ASIA II DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL TRAN HAI HAU, </p><p>WHO ACCOMPANIED PM KHAI, TOLD POLOFF SEPARATELY THAT PM KHAI </p><p>WAS "EXTREMELY PLEASED" WITH THE RECEPTION HE HAD RECEIVED </p><p>FROM HIS EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS, INCLUDING PLEDGES OF </p><p>ADDITIONAL ODA AND SUPPORT FOR VIETNAM\'S ACCESSION TO THE </p><p>WTO.  THE GVN IS "ANXIOUS TO SEE ITS ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH </p><p>EUROPE MATCH ITS POLITICAL RELATIONS," HAU NOTED.  HE WAS </p><p>UNABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAD BROUGHT UP </p><p>TRADE ISSUES THAT HAVE GENERATED CONTROVERSY BETWEEN VIETNAM </p><p>AND THE EU, SUCH AS TEXTILE QUOTAS, OR THAT THE LEADERS HAD </p><p>DISCUSSED ANY SPECIFIC MEASURES TO IMPROVE TRADE RELATIONS </p><p>WITH EUROPE.  HAU SAID THE PRIME MINISTER HAD, HOWEVER, </p><p>DISCUSSED THE NEED FOR MORE ASSISTANCE FROM THE EU "TO </p><p>BRIDGE THE DEVELOPMENT GAP AMONG ASEM COUNTRIES."  (NOTE: </p><p>THE "DEVELOPMENT GAP" IS A COMMON THEME THAT GVN OFFICIALS </p><p>CONSISTENTLY BRING UP WITHIN THE ASEAN CONTEXT TO SEEK MORE </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR VIETNAM.  END NOTE.) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02390  01 OF 03  030854Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  HAU OBSERVED THAT VIETNAM IS "LOOKING FORWARD" TO </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF AN "ECONOMIC TASK FORCE" AGREED UPON AT </p><p>THE MEETING.  HAU SAID THIS TASK FORCE WILL BE "ACTION </p><p>ORIENTED" AND CONSIDER TRADE, INVESTMENT, AND FINANCE </p><p>ISSUES.  HE ADDED THAT, AS THE HOST FOR ASEM V, VIETNAM </p><p>(ALONG WITH JAPAN) EXPECTS TO PLAY A "COORDINATING ROLE" IN </p><p>THIS TASK FORCE, BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE DETAILS AS TO </p><p>WHAT THIS ROLE WILL ENTAIL. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  MINISTRY OF TRADE (MOT) MULTILATERAL TRADE </p><p>DIVISION OFFICIALS WERE MUCH LESS UPBEAT ABOUT THE "REAL" </p><p>ECONOMIC RESULTS OF THE MEETING, HOWEVER.  THEY SAID THAT </p><p>FEW OF THEIR "TOP" ISSUES WERE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL AT A HIGH </p><p>LEVEL AND INDICATED THAT ASEM IV HAD BEEN A LOST OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO MOVE FORWARD ON STICKY BILATERAL ISSUES.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THE OFFICIALS APPEARED LESS CONVINCED OF THE ULTIMATE </p><p>USEFULNESS OF THE "ECONOMIC TASKFORCE," NOTING THAT SO FAR </p><p>THERE WAS NO CLEAR POLICY INSTRUCTION ON GOALS AND METHODS </p><p>OF ANY SUCH GROUP OR HOW THE GVN WOULD POSSIBLE FUND AND </p><p>STAFF ANOTHER SUCH EFFORT.  THEY EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT IT </p><p>WOULD END UP BEING A "SHOW" FORUM THAT WILL CONSUME </p><p>RESOURCES BUT DELIVER NO CONCRETE RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>TERRORISM/IRAQ:  STAY WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1935 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02390  02 OF 03  030854Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   EVG-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  INL-00   DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    ED-01    EXME-00  EUR-00   E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PER-00   PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------F0C0E0  030854Z /38 </p><p>R 030854Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7692 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY SEOUL </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>ALL EUROPEAN UNION POST COLLECTIVE </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ACHAO// </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 002390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02390  02 OF 03  030854Z </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  ON THE COUNTERTERRORISM FRONT, VIETNAM "WAS </p><p>PLEASED WITH AND STRONGLY SUPPORTED" THE ASEM DECLARATION, </p><p>ACCORDING TO HAU.  HOWEVER, THE PRIME MINISTER MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>"SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED" THAT THE FINAL TEXT DID NOT DISCUSS </p><p>THE "NEED TO ADDRESS POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>GAP" AS "ROOT CAUSES" OF TERRORISM, ACCORDING TO HAU.  HAU </p><p>ALSO REITERATED THE OFT-HEARD GVN VIEW THAT, IN ADDRESSING </p><p>TERRORISM AND THE IRAQ ISSUE, "RESPECT FOR THE UN CHARTER </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS IS MOST IMPORTANT."  A DANISH EMBOFF </p><p>SAID THAT A "MULTILATERAL APPROACH" TO THESE ISSUES WAS A </p><p>"COMMON THEME" EXPRESSED BY ASEM LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>KOREA:  KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  CONCERNING THE KOREAN PENINSULA, THE EUROPEAN </p><p>STUDIES CENTER\'S DR. THUAN NOTED THAT THE RECENT VISIT OF </p><p>JAPAN\'S PRIME MINISTER KOIZUMI TO NORTH KOREA HAD GENERATED </p><p>MOMENTUM TO PUSH FOR "IMPROVED STABILITY" ON THE KOREAN </p><p>PENINSULA AT THE ASEM MEETING.  THE DANISH EMBOFF SAID THAT </p><p>ASEM LEADERS HAD AGREED THAT THIS IS A "GOOD TIME TO ENGAGE </p><p>NORTH KOREA CONSTRUCTIVELY."  THE MFA\'S HAU EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02390  02 OF 03  030854Z </p><p>THE GVN IS "ENCOURAGED" BY THE ONGOING DIALOGUE AND </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA, AND "HOPES THIS </p><p>TREND WILL CONTINUE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>BILATERAL TALKS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.

THE MFA\'S </p><p>HAU NOTED THAT THESE MEETINGS WERE VERY SHORT, LASTING 10 TO </p><p>15 MINUTES, AND DID NOT GET INTO SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES.  HAU </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT PM KHAI AND PRC PREMIER ZHU RONGJI HAD NOT </p><p>DISCUSSED THE LAND BORDER ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  ACCORDING TO THE MFA\'S HAU AND PRESS REPORTS, </p><p>HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE BILATERAL VISITS INCLUDED: </p><p>--AN INVESTMENT PROMOTION AND PROTECTION AGREEMENT WITH </p><p>ICELAND AND AN AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO GVN MINISTRY </p><p>OF FISHERIES OFFICIALS; </p><p>--A PLEDGE FROM LUXEMBOURG TO PROVIDE NEARLY USD 35 MILLION </p><p>IN ODA OVER FROM 2003-2008, MAKING VIETNAM THE LARGEST </p><p>RECIPIENT IN ASIA OF LUXEMBOURG ODA IN DOLLAR TERMS. </p><p>LUXEMBOURG ALSO PLEDGED USD 250,000 IN EMERGENCY FLOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  FINALLY, LUXEMBOURG AIRLINES PROMISED TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE OPENING OF A DIRECT FLIGHT BETWEEN LUXEMBOURG </p><p>AND HO CHI MINH CITY; </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02390  02 OF 03  030854Z </p><p>--A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENT WITH BELGIUM; </p><p>--A USD 100 MILLION PLEDGE OF ADDITIONAL AID OVER THE NEXT </p><p>THREE YEARS FROM THE EU; AND, </p><p>--PLEDGES OF SUPPORT FOR VIETNAM\'S ACCESSION TO THE WTO FROM </p><p>ALL THE BILATERAL HOSTS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ASEM V ENLARGEMENT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  HAU SAID VIETNAM IS "EXCITED" TO HOST ASEM V IN </p><p>2004.  THE MFA PLANS TO WORK WITH OTHER MINISTRIES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY MOT, TO COORDINATE PLANS.  MFA IS "CONSIDERING" </p><p>ESTABLISHING A SEPARATE ASEM UNIT IN MFA TO PREPARE FOR ASEM </p><p>V, BUT FOR NOW, THE RESPONSIBILITY REMAINS WITHIN THE ASIA </p><p>II DIVISION, HAU CLAIMED.  THERE IS, HOWEVER, ALREADY AN </p><p>ASEM OFFICE IN THE MULTILATERAL TRADE DIVISION AT MOT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  HAU REPORTED THAT ASEM ENLARGEMENT WAS NOT </p><p>DISCUSSED AT THE COPENHAGEN MEETING BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN </p><p>VETTED LAST JUNE AT THE FOREIGN MINISTERS\' MEETING IN </p><p>MADRID.  "VIETNAM IS HOPEFUL" THAT ASEM V WILL INCLUDE THE </p><p>THREE REMAINING ASEAN MEMBERS (BURMA, CAMBODIA, AND LAOS) </p><p>THAT DO NOT YET PARTICIPATE IN ASEM, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THERE ARE "CONCERNS" AMONG SOME EU COUNTRIES REGARDING </p><p>BURMA.
