<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KCRM, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: INTERIOR MINISTER COMMENTS ON ASSAULT AGAINST </p><p>PUBLISHER </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1658 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolOff Robert E. Copley for reasons 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The Ambassador met on June 27 with Interior </p><p>Minister Reyes Calderon to express concern over the June 24 </p><p>criminal attack of the home of newspaper publisher Jose Ruben </p><p>Zamora, and to urge a thorough investigation.  Reyes Calderon </p><p>said that the Public Ministry was investigating the case, </p><p>despite the lack of cooperation by Zamora.  He stressed that </p><p>he has no reason to doubt that the assault had occurred the </p><p>way Zamora described it, but added that the facts that have </p><p>surfaced so far do not add up.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador paid a call on Minister of Interior </p><p>Jose Reyes Calderon on June 27 to raise, inter alia, our </p><p>concerns over the June 24 criminal attack on the home of "El </p><p>Periodico" editor and GOG critic Jose Ruben Zamora (reftel). </p><p>The Ambassador told Reyes Calderon that it is critical that </p><p>the GOG conduct a thorough investigation of the incident. </p><p>Reyes Calderon acknowledged the importance of resolving this </p><p>case and said that his Ministry was doing everything it could </p><p>to assist the Public Ministry which, he repeatedly pointed </p><p>out, is legally in charge of the investigation.  Reyes </p><p>Calderon said he hoped Mr. Zamora would cooperate more fully </p><p>with the investigation because it was extremely important to </p><p>get to the truth of what happened in such a high profile </p><p>case, and his cooperation, which has so far been limited, was </p><p>essential. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Reyes Calderon stressed that he had known Zamora </p><p>personally for many years and considered him to be a man of </p><p>honor.  He commented, however, that a number of factors in </p><p>Zamora\'s account of the incident are unusual.  For example, </p><p>Reyes Calderon said that in "typical" acts of intimidation, </p><p>the aggressors use masks to terrorize the victim and usually </p><p>destroy some of the victim\'s property to heighten the terror </p><p>and to demonstrate their control of the situation.  According </p><p>to Zamora, the group that attacked him included a woman and </p><p>wore no masks.  They spent around two hours threatening </p><p>Zamora in his house.  According to Reyes Calderon, two hours </p><p>would be an extremely risky and unnecessary amount of time to </p><p>spend in the home if the goal was simply to deliver the </p><p>message that Zamora should tone down his attacks on the </p><p>government or on organized crime. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Reyes Calderon said he had been able to inspect the </p><p>entire house and observed no sign of violence (Note: RSO and </p><p>PolOff visited the Zamora house about six hours after the </p><p>incident and observed no signs of violence in the rooms they </p><p>visited.  Zamora appeared unhurt and one of his teenage sons </p><p>with whom they spoke showed no sign of physical abuse and </p><p>seemed unusually calm given his recent ordeal (reftel). End </p><p>note).  No fingerprints have been found in the house except </p><p>for those of the family and household staff, according to </p><p>Reyes Calderon, who finds it strange that the attackers would </p><p>make no attempt to hide their faces, yet manage not to leave </p><p>fingerprints during two hours in the house.  He also pointed </p><p>out that the Zamora house is less than one hundred yards and </p><p>in the direct line of sight of a guarded gate controlling </p><p>access to the residential area.  According to Reyes Calderon, </p><p>all of the license plates recorded by the guards the morning </p><p>of the incident belonged to residents of the neighborhood </p><p>(Note: EmbOffs entered the neighborhood by a different gate </p><p>several blocks from the main entrance in an Embassy vehicle. </p><p>The guards at this gate were unsure of the location of </p><p>Zamora\'s house, and granted access without requesting </p><p>identification.  Typically residential security guards </p><p>provide very little security and would have nothing to gain </p><p>and possibly their lives to lose if they admit to witnessing </p><p>an assault such as the one on Zamora. End note). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador told Reyes Calderon that, especially in </p><p>view of the political tension surrounding the electoral </p><p>campaign, clarifying the Zamora case was in everyone\'s </p><p>interest.  He urged Reyes Calderon to continue providing all </p><p>assistance to the Public Ministry to carry out a serious and </p><p>thorough investigation. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: The attack against Zamora and his family </p><p>continues to generate significant interest in the press, and </p><p>other journalists have stepped forward to say that they, too, </p><p>have been threatened.  The incident has generated concern </p><p>that political or criminal sectors opposed to change could </p><p>engage in further violence during the election campaign in </p><p>order to protect their interests.  The GOG recognizes the </p><p>importance of investigating the incident, and Reyes Calderon </p><p>has told us that he is committed to providing all assistance </p><p>to the investigation.  Important facts about what happened at </p><p>the Zamora residence on the morning of June 24, however, are </p><p>still not known, and the success of any investigation will </p><p>depend to a large extent on cooperation between government </p><p>investigators and Zamora. </p><p>LINDWALL </p><p></p></div>
