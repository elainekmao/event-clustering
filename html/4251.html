<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 003062 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY) </p><p>INFO IIP </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, APAOS, Ios, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION:  FREE TRADE OF THE AMERICAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Orlando Henrquez writing in "La Tribuna" Tegucigalpa- </p><p>     based daily (11/05): "The Free Trade of the Americas even </p><p>     though it is viewed with skepticism and opposition by many </p><p>     Latin American countries, especially for the subsidy that </p><p>     U.S. agricultural sectors receive-- the treaty is an </p><p>     irreversible reality." Honduras is an abandoned, wretched </p><p>     and beggared country with no authority to reject the treaty </p><p>     or not participate in it." </p><p> </p><p>     "But we should be conscious that if we do not start </p><p>     seeking now a formula to be part of the treaty-- when </p><p>     it becomes a reality-- we will be undressed and </p><p>     helpless." The Free Trade Agreement could provide us </p><p>     unanticipated benefits if we can manage it as a tool of </p><p>     progress." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Marel Medina Bardales writing in "Tiempo" the San Pedro </p><p>     Sula-based daily (11/05): "The Lover of the Free Trade of </p><p>     the Americas" The FTAA is a two-faced phenomenon-- One face </p><p>     is smooth and with pieces of jewelry as well as hellacious </p><p>     avenues, the other is rugged and wrinkled". That is why many </p><p>     organizations such as the Nicaraguan organization MANANFA, </p><p>     Sinti-Techan from El Salvador, Guatemalan  Native and Rural </p><p>     Coordinator, Honduran Community Commercialization Network, </p><p>     and the Honduran Popular Group have been protesting against </p><p>     the FTAA. </p><p> </p><p>     "It is not true that it brings sustainable and stable </p><p>     growth, or more or fewer job opportunities; it destroys </p><p>     the national sovereignty, it threatens the process of </p><p>     democracy and increases the external debt.  It is a </p><p>     project that provides the control of our continent to </p><p>     benefit U.S., European and Asian transnational </p><p>     companies." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     Palmer </p><p></p></div>
