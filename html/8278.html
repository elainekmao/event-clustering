<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0145 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MAY 27, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for May 27, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Evrensel: It is claimed that MKP-HKO (Maoist </p><p>Communist Party-Peoples Liberation Army) member </p><p>Aycan Tato, killed in the clashes at Dinar Deresi </p><p>of Tunceli on May 24, was the victim of an extra- </p><p>judiciary killing. Eyewitnesses claimed that </p><p>security forces opened gunfire, without any </p><p>warning, on Tato as he walked toward the wooded </p><p>area from the house the security forces were in. </p><p>It is claimed that no weapons were found on Tato. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Evrensel: Nine presidents of Bar Associations </p><p>in Eastern and Southeastern Turkey prepared an </p><p>alternative Draft Law to the Repent Law. At a </p><p>press conference, the presidents demanded a </p><p>"general amnesty." They proposed no action to be </p><p>taken against people who had not been subjected </p><p>to any investigation in the past, and that these </p><p>people should benefit from the law provided they </p><p>applied within one year of the date the law was </p><p>enforced. The Bar Association presidents also </p><p>proposed a five year suspension of sentences for </p><p>inmates and prisoners with definite sentences. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Cumhuriyet: The Chief Public Prosecutor of </p><p>the Diyarbakir State Security Court, Saban Erbas, </p><p>sent to Ankara a report on the draft Repent Law. </p><p>The report, which expressed the views of the </p><p>officials in the region, is deemed as a "road </p><p>map" for the draft Repent Law which will be </p><p>handled at the National Security Council\'s </p><p>meeting tomorrow. Erbas, whose judiciary </p><p>jurisdiction covers Batman, Bingol, Diyarbakir, </p><p>Mardin, Sirnak, and Sanliurfa provinces, said </p><p>that the armed combat with terrorism should be </p><p>supported with legal arrangements and </p><p>psychological operations as well. Saban </p><p>emphasized that the state did not achieve its </p><p>objective of persuading the terrorists to come </p><p>down from the mountains because of the lack of </p><p>legal arrangements. Saban added that developing </p><p>technology and diversity in communication </p><p>devices, and domestic migration made it difficult </p><p>to follow terrorist organizations; he emphasized </p><p>that it was important to know the organizational </p><p>structure of terrorist organizations in combating </p><p>them. Regarding the most recent Repent Law, </p><p>declared on August 26, 1999, Saban said it was </p><p>not successful because of its narrow scope. He </p><p>added, "In order to bring down the terrorists in </p><p>the mountains, security forces constantly claimed </p><p>that the terrorists could benefit from the repent </p><p>law. The terrorists who surrendered to security </p><p>forces as a result of this propaganda were </p><p>disappointed with the fact that the repent law </p><p>was not applied. They reached the conclusion that </p><p>the security forces\' propaganda did not reflect </p><p>reality." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Cumhuriyet: One single house has not been </p><p>built for the 1966 earthquake victims in Mus. The </p><p>earthquake victims in Mus warned the Bingol </p><p>earthquake victims not to be deceived by promises </p><p>made by politicians, and that they should take </p><p>care of themselves.  Regarding the situation of </p><p>the 1966 earthquake in Mus, Mayor Abdulbari Han </p><p>said: "The officials promised houses for 4,400 </p><p>people. With contributions from the World Red </p><p>Crescent, the British government built 589 </p><p>temporary barracks for the victims, and officials </p><p>promised that permanent houses would be </p><p>constructed in a very short time. Although 37 </p><p>years have passed since the earthquake, no houses </p><p>have been built in Mus, and most of the people </p><p>qualified for the houses have died." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Turkiye: Mustafa Caliskan, the President of </p><p>the Adana Chapter of MUSIAD (Independent </p><p>Industrialists and Businessmen Association), said </p><p>the sugar price in Turkey was fivefold that of </p><p>world prices, and added, "the state should end </p><p>the period of loading its losses on the shoulders </p><p>of 70 million people." Caliskan said a kilo of </p><p>granular sugar was sold for approximately one USD </p><p>while it was only 0.20 USD in the world markets. </p><p>Caliskan said while sugar is overpriced in the </p><p>country, the General Directorate of the Sugar </p><p>Plants was seeking permission to export its </p><p>excessive sugar stocks for half the price </p><p>determined for exportation. He said the issue </p><p>should be investigated. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
