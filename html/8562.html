The Central MOT in Baghdad announced the first </p><p>nationwide public food distribution since the military </p><p>action against the regime of Saddam Hussein, would begin in </p><p>June.  The commodities and size of the June ration are </p><p>publicized.  There is concern that the ration is missing </p><p>three commodities and that the quantity of beans is quite </p><p>low.  Expectations regarding the items in the ration are </p><p>rumored to be high with the fall of the former regime. </p><p>There is still no word about the Coalition Provisional </p><p>Authority payments to each governorate MOT office of USD </p><p>50,000.  WFP is in need of additional warehouse space in </p><p>Basrah, but has decided to train the stevedores in better </p><p>stacking methods as finding additional warehouse space is </p><p>difficult.  Problems with security in the central warehouse </p><p>complex in Basrah continue.  Coalition forces are training </p><p>the MOT guard force, but are not convinced this is the </p><p>answer to the problem.  Food agents for Az Zubayr pick up </p><p>their food rations from the Basrah central warehouse complex </p><p>on 1 June.  MOT offices receive safes and furniture from the </p><p>DART.  Commencement of repair of the grain silo in Basrah is </p><p>still a week away.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>PDS JUNE RATION ANNOUNCED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  At the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA)/British </p><p>Coalition public distribution system (PDS) working group </p><p>meeting on 29 May, the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) </p><p>presented the Central Ministry of Trade\'s (MOT) proposed </p><p>ration for the month of June.  The adult ration, for the </p><p>entire country, is as follows:  9 kilograms (kg) of flour, 3 </p><p>kg of rice, 0.25 kg of beans, 1 kg of vegetable oil, 2 kg of </p><p>sugar, 0.20 kg of tea, 0.25 kg of soap, and 0.50 kg of </p><p>detergent.  The infant ration consists of 8 tins (3.6 kg) of </p><p>infant formula, 0.50 kg of detergent, and a soap bar.  The </p><p>cost for a single adult or infant ration is 250 Iraqi Dinars </p><p>for June, the same price as pre-war. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The proposed beans ration of 0.25 kg per person is one- </p><p>sixth of what WFP had outlined in its Emergency Operation </p><p>(EMOP), which calls for a monthly ration of 1.5 kg beans. </p><p>Supplies of beans are on the way, but unfortunately the </p><p>shipping schedules are behind.  In addition, the announced </p><p>June ration is missing weaning cereal, dried whole milk, and </p><p>salt because of insufficient quantities in the country. </p><p>These items are normally part of the ration. </p><p> </p><p>4.  CPA and British Coalition forces in the lower south have </p><p>expressed their concern about being bound by decisions made </p><p>by the MOT in Baghdad, claiming that the former regime </p><p>continually overlooked the south, and thus the needs are </p><p>greater in the south.  They are also concerned that the </p><p>perpetuation of centralized MOT control in Baghdad risks </p><p>undermining current efforts of CPA and British Coalition </p><p>forces to meet needs effectively in their area of </p><p>responsibility.  WFP agreed that the presumed disconnect </p><p>between Baghdad and the southern governorates was one that </p><p>needed to be addressed.  WFP proposed that CPA, WFP, and the </p><p>DART request a Baghdad meeting with WFP/Baghdad, CPA/Main, </p><p>and MOT/Baghdad to raise the issues of representation, </p><p>participation, and delegation of authority. </p><p> </p><p>5.  To announce the nationwide 1 June revival of the PDS, </p><p>the following is being repeated in Arabic on "Bayna Al- </p><p>Nahrain" radio station, run by the Coalition Forces:  "Dear </p><p>Citizens of Iraq:  The World Food Program will start its </p><p>food distributions to all Iraqis on June 01, 2003.  The food </p><p>will be delivered to all Ministry of Trade authorized food </p><p>agents in your areas.  In order to ensure a smooth food </p><p>distribution, you will need to contact your food </p><p>distribution agent and present your food ration cards just </p><p>like before. Your cooperation is highly appreciated."  The </p><p>Civil Military Operations Center (CMOC) wrote the copy for </p><p>this announcement. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Rumors are circulating that the June ration is going to </p><p>be composed of items never intended to be part of the </p><p>distribution.  There are counterfeit lists circulating in </p><p>different regions through sales in the local markets.  These </p><p>fraudulent lists include additional food items, as well as </p><p>small appliances and tableware.  The DART has seen the lists </p><p>in the markets of Basrah, Al Hillah, Samawah, and Arbil.  It </p><p>seems that entrepreneurs are creating false lists, sometimes </p><p>in the form of ration cards, and selling them as the genuine </p><p>article.  Iraqis may be prone to believe the validity of the </p><p>lists because expectations about the ration are rumored to </p><p>be high in a post-Saddam era.  This points to the need for </p><p>the Central MOT to publicize widely the actual ration.  As </p><p>of 1 June, the MOT in Basrah had not received the Central </p><p>MOT\'s official notice about the June ration through official </p><p>MOT channels from Baghdad, although WFP had shared it with </p><p>the MOT.  The DART reports that other governorate MOT </p><p>offices have also not received the official word. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>WHERE ARE THE USD 50,000 PAYMENTS? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  CPA Lower South reported that after two official </p><p>requests for information, there is still no word from </p><p>CPA/Main about the USD 50,000 payments to the governorate- </p><p>level MOT offices.  (Note:  The DART reports that no </p><p>notification has been made as to start date of the payments </p><p>in other governorates either.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>NEED FOR ADDITIONAL WAREHOUSE SPACE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>8.  WFP reported several days ago that the central warehouse </p><p>facilities in Basrah were full, with 13 trucks waiting to </p><p>offload.  British Coalition forces indicated that they were </p><p>in the process of drawing down their presence in the </p><p>warehouse, but would not be able to vacate the space in time </p><p>to meet the immediate need for additional space.  In </p><p>response, the MOT manager offered alternative warehousing at </p><p>the Basrah port. </p><p> </p><p>9.  However, after examining the port storage facilities, </p><p>WFP decided to instead send the Basrah overflow of </p><p>commodities to a warehouse in Az Zubayr (20 minutes away). </p><p>At the same time, WFP logistics is going to train the </p><p>stevedores in off-loading practices, teaching them to stack </p><p>the bags more tightly and higher.  WFP feels this action </p><p>will ultimately increase the tonnage amounts stored in the </p><p>central warehouse. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>MOT SECURITY FORCE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  British Coalition forces reported that half of a 96-man </p><p>MOT guard force has been trained to protect the MOT complex. </p><p>The other half is to be trained this week.  Guards are </p><p>working, but the  British forces report there is a shortage </p><p>of weapons.  British forces are awaiting a shipment of </p><p>confiscated arms, modified to prevent automatic firing that </p><p>will be distributed as they arrive.  (Note: The British are </p><p>concerned that the MOT guards who are being trained are "not </p><p>young enough" for the job.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  A number of holding cells have been repaired at the </p><p>central warehouse gate and are manned by newly trained </p><p>Basrah police.  More than 80 looters were captured at the </p><p>warehouse facility last week.  Three looters who escaped </p><p>capture are reported to have drowned in nearby canals as </p><p>they fled the warehouse during a Coalition raid on 26 May. </p><p> </p><p>12.  In addition, the MOT reported on 31 May that 80 looters </p><p>(WFP thinks the number was closer to 20) entered the </p><p>warehouse compound on the night of 30 May.  The British </p><p>forces indicate that it is losing confidence in the MOT </p><p>guard force, suspecting that the majority of the guards come </p><p>from the same area (near the warehouse complex) as the </p><p>looters themselves.  As Basrah MOT guards remain unarmed and </p><p>hesitant to interfere with looters, the need for a dedicated </p><p>Coalition security force has become critical until the </p><p>issues with the MOT guard force are sorted out.  The British </p><p>forces reported on 31 May that it had been tasked to provide </p><p>additional security at the central warehouse complex during </p><p>the June PDS distribution period. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>FOOD AGENTS COLLECT RATIONS ON 1 JUNE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  The DART visited the central warehouse complex in </p><p>Basrah on 31 May to observe preparations for the arrival of </p><p>Az Zubayr food agents on 1 June, as Az Zubayr is the first </p><p>district in Basrah governorate to receive the June rations. </p><p>The visit coincided with elections for the selection of a </p><p>Chief of Security by the MOT guard force.  DART staff will </p><p>be posted at the central warehouse on 1 June to observe the </p><p>food agents receiving their rations.  The DART will also </p><p>monitor the activity in the MOT office and the Ration </p><p>Registration Center (RRC), as those who may have been </p><p>excluded from the PDS prior to the war or new townspeople </p><p>arrive to re-register for the PDS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>MOT WAREHOUSE/OFFICE EQUIPMENT AND REPAIRS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  The MOT requested British Coalition assistance in </p><p>locating eight functioning forklifts, which MOT employees </p><p>insist were removed by British forces during the past two </p><p>weeks.  WFP reported that the MOT now "repairs" forklifts </p><p>for their period of use only, removing necessary parts when </p><p>they are not in use to prevent the forklifts from being </p><p>"requisitioned" by military personnel.  The British forces </p><p>have promised to try and locate the missing equipment.  They </p><p>subsequently located two of the eight missing forklifts and </p><p>were to return them on 31 May. </p><p> </p><p>15.  On 30 May, the MOT expressed concern that there were no </p><p>safes at the warehouse facility, which is currently also </p><p>doubling as the RRC.  Due to bank closures, food agents will </p><p>be turning over significant amounts of money to the MOT </p><p>prior to receiving their rations.  Given the high level of </p><p>insecurity at the central warehouse complex, distributions </p><p>could not begin before a way to secure funds was </p><p>established.  The DART contacted the International </p><p>Organization for Migration (IOM), its implementing partner </p><p>for the rehabilitation of the MOT, RRC, and warehouse </p><p>administrative center, and obtained assurances that five </p><p>safes would be procured and delivered by 31 May. </p><p> </p><p>16.  To follow up, the DART visited the central warehouse </p><p>complex on 31 May to check progress.  The DART found that </p><p>British "Quip" and U.S. Department of Defense ODACHA-funded </p><p>rehabilitation of the warehouse administrative offices was </p><p>progressing well, and computers that were taken home by MOT </p><p>employees and stored in their homes were in the process of </p><p>being re-installed at the warehouse facility.  Per above, </p><p>safes were being installed by IOM, and DART requested that </p><p>IOM make an additional procurement of chairs and printer </p><p>cartridges for the MOT offices. </p><p> </p><p>17.  On 31 May, the DART located the Coalition Civil Affairs </p><p>contracting officer for the DOD ODACHA-funded silo complex </p><p>rehabilitation project.  He reported that work on the silo </p><p>is to begin within a week, but cautioned that parts </p><p>necessary for the repair of the grain elevator would have to </p><p>be ordered from the U.S. and would arrive in five to seven </p><p>days.  The DART will visit the silo complex with the Civil </p><p>Affairs contracting officer later this week.  (Note:  With </p><p>the arrival of ships carrying bulk grain cargo into the Port </p><p>of Umm Qasr, the need for the silos to be cleaned and </p><p>repaired in Umm Qasr and Basrah is becoming more crucial by </p><p>the day.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
