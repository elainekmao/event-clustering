<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002859 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRESIDENT OBASANJO\'S DRAFT 2002 BUDGET SHOWS </p><p>RESTRAINT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 997 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  The draft 2002 budget presented by President </p><p>Obasanjo November 7 signals his attempt to restrain spending </p><p>despite upcoming elections.  Proposed spending levels total </p><p>N841 billion (USD 7.5 billion), a seven percent reduction </p><p>from the adjusted 2001 budget.  Thirty-five percent of the </p><p>budget is allocated to capital expenditures, compared with 56 </p><p>percent in 2001.  Budget revenue assumptions are also more </p><p>realistic than 2001: oil prices of USD 18 per barrel and </p><p>production of 2.1 million barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil </p><p>and condensate.  However, the projected 2002 GDP growth rate </p><p>of 5.6 percent may be too optimistic.  The budget projects a </p><p>deficit of N102 billion, roughly 2.8 percent of projected </p><p>2002 GDP.  Many national legislators are displeased with the </p><p>President\'s proposal.  Some claim the draft is too asutere </p><p>while others complain the proposal is too large and does not </p><p>allow for complete funding of the 2001 budget. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  President Obasanjo presented the draft 2002 Federal </p><p>Budget to the National Assembly on November 7.  The draft </p><p>budget totals Naira 840.8 billion (roughly USD 7.5 billion) </p><p>with only 35 percent in projected capital expenditures </p><p>(N297.2 billion; USD 2.7 billion) and the remainder in </p><p>recurrent expenditures (N543.6 billion; USD 4.9 billion). </p><p>The President\'s proposed 2002 capital expenditures represent </p><p>a 41 percent reduction from adjusted 2001 proposed capital </p><p>expenditures while proposed recurrent expenditures grew 37 </p><p>percent over 2001 allocations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Total Federal Retained Revenue is projected to be N632.9 </p><p>billion (USD 5.7 billion).  Federal Retained Revenue includes </p><p>the federal government\'s share of the federation account (oil </p><p>and non-oil revenue) plus VAT, special funds, privatization </p><p>proceeds, federal government industry revenue, proceeds from </p><p>grain sales and open acreage allocation fees.  See reftel for </p><p>a detailed description of Nigeria\'s budget structure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. With expenditures totaling N840.8 billion, the budget </p><p>projects a fiscal deficit of N207.9 billion (USD 1.86 </p><p>billion), representing 5.8 percent of projected 2002 GDP. </p><p>The budget assumes a 2002 GDP growth rate of 5.6 percent for </p><p>total GDP of N3.567 trillion (USD 32 billion).  However, the </p><p>President has proposed using excess oil proceeds from July to </p><p>September 2001, recovered funds looted during the former </p><p>military regime, grants and assistance to offset the deficit </p><p>by N106.3 billion (USD 950 million), leaving an actual </p><p>deficit of N101.6 billion (USD 907 million), or 2.8 percent </p><p>of GDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The budget proposes N190.4 billion (USD 1.7 billion) for </p><p>external debt servicing costs, including both publicly and </p><p>privately held debt.  This draft is N30 billion lower than </p><p>the adjusted 2001 budget, which targeted USD 2 billion for </p><p>debt servicing.  Debt servicing is deducted from oil revenue </p><p>as a first line charge and is not included in the Federal </p><p>Retained Revenue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Budget Assumptions </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The assumptions on revenue earnings for the 2002 Budget </p><p>proposal are more realistic than those used for the 2001 </p><p>Budget.  The President\'s proposal assumes an oil price of USD </p><p>18 per barrel, down from USD 22 per barrel last year.  Crude </p><p>oil production is expected to meet the OPEC production quota </p><p>of 1.835 million b/d in addition to condensate production of </p><p>250,000 b/d for a total production volume of 2.08 million </p><p>b/d.  The GON\'s 57 percent equity share in that production </p><p>gives it 1.19 million b/d, minus 445,000 b/d for domestic </p><p>consumption.  Therefore, the 2002 budget is based on crude </p><p>oil exports of 741,700 b/d at USD 18 per barrel (minus </p><p>production costs of USD 9.5 per barrel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The proposed budget is also predicated on a 5.6 percent </p><p>growth rate in 2002 GDP.  Although this projection is on the </p><p>high end, it is not wholly unrealistic if current reforms are </p><p>completed and the privatization program advances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. The most unrealistic assumption in the proposed budget is </p><p>the exchange rate projection of N110 to the U.S. dollar -- </p><p>the same exchange rate used in the 2001 budget.  In </p><p>compliance with the new IMF informal policy framework </p><p>(reported septel), the GON is committed to a market-based </p><p>exchange rate and harmonization of official and parallel </p><p>rates, which would result in an estimated ten percent </p><p>depreciation of the Naira.  However, since 80 percent of the </p><p>budget is funded from oil revenues, which are </p><p>dollar-denominated, a depreciated Naira may not have a very </p><p>severe impact on the budget. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Response from the National Assembly </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  The draft budget was not well received by many national </p><p>legislators.  Some claim the proposed budget is miserly and </p><p>additional capital projects are necessary.  Others assert </p><p>that it is too large because nearly half of the 2001 budget </p><p>remains to be funded.  These legislators wonder how the </p><p>President intends to satisfy unmet 2001 obligations and </p><p>implement the 2002 budget proposal without producing a large </p><p>fiscal deficit that would dampen the macroeconomic </p><p>environment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Moreover, Representative Mohammed S. Daggash, Chairman of </p><p>the House Finance Committee, asserted that the President had </p><p>spent off-line roughly N200 billion (USD 1.8 billion) in </p><p>projects and programs not approved in either the 2001 Budget </p><p>or Supplemental Budgets, representing a nearly 25 percent </p><p>"hidden" increase to the 2001 Budget.  These additional </p><p>expenditures were unconstitutional, he said, because they had </p><p>not received legislative approval.  As a result, Daggash </p><p>claimed, the federal deficit stood at roughly N235 billion as </p><p>of end-October 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Comment.  The President\'s use of more realistic oil price </p><p>and production figures and lower capital expenditures is a </p><p>sign that he apparently intends to restrain spending in 2002. </p><p> Lower capital expenditures will contribute to this image </p><p>objective, but may cause severe heartburn among politicians </p><p>who rely on government procurement contracts for political </p><p>patronage and personal enrichment.  High recurrent </p><p>expenditures likely reflect anticipated rises in federal </p><p>employee wages delayed from 2001 until April 1, 2002.  Those </p><p>who claim this budget is too large, given the extent the 2001 </p><p>budget remains unfunded, have a point. Their concerns may </p><p>likely be drowned out by those clamoring for more Naira to </p><p>pass through the government till.  Given the likely pressure </p><p>to increase the 2002 budget, the President may be forced to </p><p>accept higher spending in order for the bill to pass through </p><p>the Assembly.  However, President Obasanjo will probably not </p><p>concede to demands to complete implementation of the 2001 </p><p>budget given the current deficit and his commitment to </p><p>restrain spending within an informal IMF arrangement.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
