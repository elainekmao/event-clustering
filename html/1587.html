IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: ON MARCH 14, ZIMBABWE FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>STANISLAUS MUDENGE BRIEFED ZIMBABWE\'S DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>AND THE PRESS ON THE FUTURE OF THE PROPOSED AFRICAN </p><p>UNION, CHANGES MADE TO SADC STRUCTURES IN WINDHOEK ON </p><p>MARCH 9, AND THE STATUS OF LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p>MUDENGE ALSO TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ANOTHER JAB AT </p><p>THE UK.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S STATEMENTS ON THE DRC </p><p>WERE REPORTED IN REF A.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>AFRICAN UNION CLOSER TO FRUITION </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MUDENGE BRIEFED HEADS OF MISSION ON THE EARLY </p><p>MARCH OAU EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT HELD IN SIRTE, LIBYA. </p><p>MUCH OF THE SUMMIT WAS FOCUSED ON THE CREATION OF AN </p><p>AFRICAN UNION, WHICH WILL BE ALONG THE LINES OF THE </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION, THE MINISTER REPORTED.  NEW STRUCTURES, </p><p>INCLUDING AN EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, A PAN-AFRICAN </p><p>PARLIAMENT, A HIGH COURT, AN AFRICAN CENTRAL BANK, AND A </p><p>VARIETY OF TECHNICAL COMMITTEES, WERE ALL AGREED UPON. </p><p>ALL 53 COUNTRIES ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT HAVE SIGNED </p><p>THE ACT THAT CONSTITUTES THE UNION; 32 HAVE FORMALLY </p><p>RATIFIED THE ACT, AND ONLY FOUR MORE ARE NEEDED TO MAKE </p><p>THE UNION A REALITY, MUDENGE SAID.  (NOTE: LIBYAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR MAHMOUD YOUSEF AZZABI LATER INTERJECTED TO </p><p>SAY THAT TWO MORE COUNTRIES HAD JUST RATIFIED THE ACT, </p><p>BRINGING THE TOTAL TO 34.  END NOTE.) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01030  01 OF 02  151446Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE UNION IS EXPECTED TO BE OPERATIONAL BY NEXT </p><p>YEAR, MUDENGE CONTINUED.  THE UNION\'S HEADQUARTERS WILL </p><p>BE IN ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA, BUT ITS OTHER INSTITUTIONS, </p><p>SUCH AS THE PARLIAMENT AND CENTRAL BANK, WILL LIKELY BE </p><p>HEADQUARTERED IN YET-TO-BE-DETERMINED CITIES.  THE OAU </p><p>STRUCTURES WILL EVENTUALLY BE FOLDED INTO THE AFRICAN </p><p>UNION.  MUDENGE NOTED THAT ZIMBABWE AND SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>HAVE ALREADY RATIFIED THE AFRICAN UNION ACT, AND ASSURED </p><p>THE DIPLOMATS PRESENT THAT THERE IS A "VIGOROUS </p><p>COMMITMENT BY AFRICA TO GO FORWARD" WITH THE UNION. </p><p> </p><p>RESULTS OF SADC SUMMIT DOWNPLAYED </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE FOREIGN MINISTER TRIED TO DOWNPLAY THE </p><p>RESULTS OF THE SADC SUMMIT HELD IN WINDHOEK ON MARCH 9. </p><p>HE STATED THAT THE SUMMIT WAS FOCUSED ON "MODERNIZING" </p><p>SADC\'S INSTITUTIONS, AS THE DECENTRALIZATION OF SOME </p><p>ORGANS HAD BECOME A PROBLEM.  MUDENGE CLAIMED THE PRESS </p><p>WAS "CONFUSED" ABOUT THE DECISION MADE TO BRING THE </p><p>ORGAN ON POLITICS, DEFENSE AND SECURITY INTO THE FORMAL </p><p>SADC FRAMEWORK UNDER THE SADC CHAIRMAN.  THE MINISTER </p><p>ASSERTED THAT THE DECISION TO ROTATE THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF </p><p>THE ORGAN WAS NOT NEW--THE CHAIRMANSHIP WAS SUPPOSED TO </p><p>BE ROTATED FROM THE ORGAN\'S INCEPTION IN 1996, BUT THE </p><p>MEMBER STATES HAD SIMPLY DECIDED TO RENEW PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE\'S MANDATE YEAR AFTER YEAR.  ZIMBABWE "KNEW" THIS </p><p>COULD NOT GO ON INDEFINITELY.  HOWEVER, MUDENGE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT MUGABE WAS NOT VOTED OUT OF THE </p><p>CHAIRMANSHIP AT THE SUMMIT AS SOME PRESS ARTICLES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01030  01 OF 02  151446Z </p><p>STATED.  ALL THE HEADS OF STATE UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO </p><p>PUT OFF ELECTING A NEW CHAIRMAN UNTIL THE SIGNING OF THE </p><p>NEW SADC CHARTER IN AUGUST.  ALL THE MEMBER STATES WERE </p><p>VERY HAPPY WITH THIS DECISION, THE FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>LAND REFORM IS PROCEEDING </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MUDENGE WENT ON TO SAY THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE HAD </p><p>ASKED HIM TO RESPOND TO THE UNDP\'S LETTER URGING THE GOZ </p><p>TO BREAK THE IMPASSE ON LAND REFORM (REF B).  MUDENGE </p><p>SAID HE COULD NOT DIVULGE THE DETAILS OF THE GOZ\'S </p><p>RESPONSE, AS THEY WERE INTENDED FOR UNDP ADMINISTRATOR </p><p>MARK MALLOCH-BROWN.  THE GOZ WILL FOLLOW THE LAWS OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE WHEN IT PURSUES ITS LAND REFORM PROGRAM, THE </p><p>MINISTER CONTENDED.  "WE DO NOT REGARD THE ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>THE WAR VETERANS AS LEGAL, BUT ONLY AS A DEMONSTRATION </p><p>OF THEIR FRUSTRATION," HE SAID.  ZIMBABWE WANTS TO AVOID </p><p>THE ENORMOUS BLOODSHED THAT WOULD OCCUR IF IT TRIED TO </p><p>EXPEL THE WAR VETS FROM THE OCCUPIED FARMS.  OUR FAST- </p><p>TRACK LAND REFORM PROGRAM WILL "SHORTEN THE PERIOD OF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2806 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01030  02 OF 02  151446Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  IRM-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------D22A09  151450Z /38 </p><p>P 151443Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8440 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>OAU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001030 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/15/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE FOREIGN MINISTER BRIEFS DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CORPS ON AFRICAN UNION, SADC, AND LAND REFORM </p><p> </p><p>AMBIGUITY," MUDENGE CLAIMED.  THE GOZ HAS RESETTLED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01030  02 OF 02  151446Z </p><p>60,000 PEOPLE ON TWO MILLION HECTARES ALREADY.  "GO SEE </p><p>FOR YOURSELVES WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE DONE WITH FEW </p><p>INPUTS," HE CHALLENGED.  MUDENGE REMARKED THAT THEIR </p><p>CROPS "LOOK WONDERFUL," BUT ADMITTED THAT THE LIVING </p><p>CONDITIONS OF THE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOOD. </p><p> </p><p>ANOTHER JAB AT THE BRITISH </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE FOREIGN MINISTER COULD NOT PASS UP AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ANOTHER JAB AT THE BRITISH, WHOSE </p><p>HIGH COMMISSIONER WAS IN ATTENDANCE AT THE BRIEFING.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM THE SPANISH AMBASSADOR, </p><p>MUDENGE ACCUSED THE UK OF TRYING TO SCUTTLE THE EU\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO HELP ZIMBABWE OUT OF ITS TROUBLES.  "HOW CAN </p><p>THEY CRITICIZE BELGIUM AND FRANCE FOR RECEIVING </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE?" HE ASKED.  A PALL FELL OVER THE ROOM </p><p>AS MUDENGE CALLED THE BRITISH "RACISTS" IN FRONT OF THE </p><p>ENTIRE DIPLOMATIC CORPS AND SAID THEIR ATTITUDE WOULD </p><p>EXACERBATE RACIAL DIVISIONS IN ZIMBABWE.  MUDENGE\'S RANT </p><p>WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE HEADLINE STORY IN THE MARCH 15 </p><p>EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MUDENGE\'S ENTHUSIASTIC ENDORSEMENT OF THE LIBYA- </p><p>SPONSORED SUMMIT ON THE AFRICAN UNION SUGGESTS SOME KIND </p><p>OF QUID PRO QUO MAY BE AT WORK BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>LIBYA.  ALTHOUGH MANY IN THE GOZ UNDOUBTEDLY AGREE THAT </p><p>THE IDEA OF AN AFRICAN UNION HAS SOME APPEALING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01030  02 OF 02  151446Z </p><p>ELEMENTS, PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS BEEN TO LIBYA NUMEROUS </p><p>TIMES BEFORE TO SEEK RELIEF FOR HIS COUNTRY\'S CHRONIC </p><p>FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND FUEL SHORTAGES.  MUDENGE\'S EFFORT </p><p>TO DOWNPLAY PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S EFFECTIVE OUSTER FROM </p><p>SADC\'S SECURITY ORGAN WAS AS TRANSPARENT AS IT WAS </p><p>EXPECTED.  GOVERNMENT SPINMEISTERS HAVE WORKED HARD TO </p><p>PORTRAY SADC\'S MOVE AS A REGULAR ROTATION OF THE </p><p>SECURITY ORGAN\'S CHAIRMANSHIP, NOT AS A VOTE OF NO- </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN MUGABE\'S HANDLING OF ZIMBABWE\'S POLITICAL </p><p>AND ECONOMIC CRISES.  THERE WAS NOTHING NEW IN THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER\'S REMARKS ON LAND REFORM.  ANY FEELINGS </p><p>OF GOODWILL HE MAY HAVE RESURRECTED IN BRINGING TOGETHER </p><p>THE RESIDENT MISSION HEADS WERE SWEPT AWAY BY HIS </p><p>UNDIPLOMATIC DIATRIBE AGAINST THE BRITISH.  MUDENGE\'S </p><p>UNEVEN DIPLOMACY IS CHARACTERISTIC OF GOZ ACTIONS IN </p><p>GENERAL: ONE STEP FORWARD FOLLOWED BY TWO STEPS BACK. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
