<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 THE HAGUE 001731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AC/CB, NP/CBM, VC/CCB, L/ACV, IO/S </p><p>SECDEF FOR OSD/ISP </p><p>JOINT STAFF FOR DD PMA-A FOR WTC </p><p>COMMERCE FOR BIS (GOLDMAN) </p><p>NSC FOR CHUPA </p><p>WINPAC FOR FOLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, CWC </p><p>SUBJECT: CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION (CWC): WRAP-UP FOR 16 </p><p>- 30 JUNE </p><p> </p><p>This is CWC-74-03. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  No other delegations showed enthusiasm for </p><p>committing, as of Friday, June 20, to a serious, sustained </p><p>effort at a systemic fix for Article IV/V financing. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  There were no immediate results from this round of </p><p>industry intersessional consultations, but it is possible </p><p>that the September Executive Council could take decisions on </p><p>Boundaries of Production and Requests for Clarification of </p><p>Declarations. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Facilitator Eric Wills (Netherlands) tried to get </p><p>consensus on what he considered the technical issues in the </p><p>draft decision on sampling and analysis.  He appears to have </p><p>succeeded, with the exception of the French, who insist that </p><p>analysis results be hand-carried from the designated lab that </p><p>performed the analysis to The Hague. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Ambassador Javits will participate in site visits at </p><p>Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Tooele, Utah the week of 14 July </p><p>and will return to Washington for consultations 18-19 July. </p><p> </p><p>Topics: </p><p> </p><p>-- Article IV/V Consultations </p><p>-- June Industry Intersessionals </p><p>-- Sampling and Analysis Procedures </p><p>-- Ambassador Javits Upcoming Travel </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Article IV/V Consultations </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  US Del led off the comments, expressing regret that </p><p>the proposed facilitator\'s report for EC-33 language was so </p><p>anodyne and arguing that the reference only to "efforts to </p><p>achieve prompt issue and payment of invoices" was reductive </p><p>and did not cover many other elements of the Article IV/V </p><p>problem. Deloff made the point that U.S. inability as of yet </p><p>to reimburse for Article IV/V in 2003 did not in any way </p><p>speak to problems with the system of budgeting for and </p><p>assessing Article IV/V.  Del urged the need for serious </p><p>discussion of a real solution to this problem, underlining </p><p>that the USG was willing to discuss the three main </p><p>approaches, as outlined in draft EC-33 guidance.  Facilitator </p><p>Geoff Cole (UK) welcomed this, but then pointed out in detail </p><p>the problems with each of the three, e.g. difficulties that </p><p>might arise with assessment based on previous year\'s </p><p>activities if there were significant year-to-year </p><p>fluctuations in the amount of work carried out. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  No other delegations showed enthusiasm for </p><p>committing, as of Friday, June 20, to a serious, sustained </p><p>effort at a systemic fix for Article IV/V. (Ruth Flint </p><p>(Switzerland) indicated a preference for the system of </p><p>assessing based on previous year\'s activity.)  Overall </p><p>preference was to suggest modest edits to the facilitator\'s </p><p>text and he recalled that a statement at an EC in mid-2002 </p><p>had referred to the possibility of possessor states making </p><p>voluntary advance payments on Article IV/V, should they so </p><p>wish.  There was broad support for resurrecting this </p><p>previously agreed language. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The Spanish thought the reference to payment of </p><p>invoices "as far as possible within the same year as the work </p><p>carried out" in the facilitator\'s draft was too vague, and </p><p>suggested replacing "the work" with "the inspections". </p><p>Nobody had problems with that. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  A number of dels specified that they had no </p><p>instructions with respect to allowing reimbursements for </p><p>withdrawals from the Working Capital Fund to cover 2004 needs </p><p>to be made as late as the end of 2005.  This group of </p><p>countries included Germany, France, and Russia. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>June Industry Intersessionals </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  There were no immediate results from this round of </p><p>industry intersessional consultations, but it is possible </p><p>that the September Executive Council could take decisions on </p><p>Boundaries of Production and Requests for Clarification of </p><p>Declarations. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Facilitators held meetings on Captive Use, Requests </p><p>for Clarification of Declarations, Low Concentrations </p><p>Schedule 2A/2Aasterisk, the draft Handbook on Chemicals (part </p><p>of the draft Declarations Handbook), and the draft </p><p>Declarations Handbook.  The session on OCPF (Other Chemical </p><p>Production Facility or UDOC) plant site selection was </p><p>cancelled because the new U.S. paper had not been coordinated </p><p>with Switzerland. </p><p> </p><p>-- The two sessions on the draft Declarations Handbook and </p><p>its Handbook on Chemicals raised issues too technical for </p><p>delegations to respond to adequately on the spot.  There </p><p>might easily be consensus, however, if some of the proposals </p><p>could be translated into simple language.  Especially useful </p><p>are the suggestions to highlight the most used chemicals in </p><p>the Handbook on Chemicals, and to make forms A-1 and A-2 of </p><p>the draft Declarations Handbook an annual submission from all </p><p>States Parties, reconfirming their National Authority </p><p>information and certifying that they have nothing else to </p><p>declare (if that is the case).  The facilitator (Manfred </p><p>Ruck, Germany) also proposes a simple new system to assign </p><p>unique identifier numbers to all Scheduled chemicals that do </p><p>not have Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers.  He intends </p><p>next to sort out mixtures declarations. </p><p> </p><p>-- A decision on Requests for Clarification of Declarations </p><p>should be possible now that Del has been able to respond to </p><p>the Iranian legal objections.  There is broad support for a </p><p>political commitment to providing some kind of answer to such </p><p>requests within 60 days, especially since 45 percent of such </p><p>requests in 2002 involved inspectability of plant sites, and </p><p>60 percent involved compliance concerns.  Iran and others are </p><p>swayed by the argument that if a declaration is not complete, </p><p>the timeline for submitting declarations under the Convention </p><p>has not been met. </p><p> </p><p>-- The British facilitator for Low Concentrations suggested </p><p>that Amiton be moved to Schedule 1 because it is no longer </p><p>used, but neither he nor the Scientific Advisory Board had </p><p>done their homework in this respect.  When Del asked if the </p><p>Technical Secretariat had any information, Industry </p><p>Verification Branch confirmed that declarations of transfers </p><p>of Amiton are still coming in. </p><p> </p><p>-- Captive Use is still being blocked by Russia because </p><p>Russia does not declare any Schedule 3 production that does </p><p>not leave the plant site.  (The Russian delegation would sign </p><p>up to the captive use language with respect to Schedule 2 </p><p>only.)  Germany also spoke out for the first time, reserving </p><p>on the draft decision text because there is no agreement in </p><p>Berlin.  The German del clarified later that Germany does </p><p>not/not interpret the Boundaries of Production decision to </p><p>require any declarations based only on calculations.  Unless </p><p>a measurement has been made, Germany maintains there is </p><p>nothing for inspectors to verify, since re-doing calculations </p><p>does not constitute Verification. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Sampling and Analysis </p><p>Procedures 19 June 2003 </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Facilitator Eric Wills (Netherlands) tried to get </p><p>consensus on what he considered the technical issues in the </p><p>24 April draft decision.  He appears to have succeeded, with </p><p>the exception of the French insistence that analysis results </p><p>be hand-carried from the designated lab that performed the </p><p>analysis to The Hague (para. 11.8 (e)). </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  The French del has had a bad experience with the </p><p>Technical Secretariat\'s approach to confidentiality, and does </p><p>not want to allow any additional hands/eyes on the analysis </p><p>results.  The Rijswijk lab (Stefan Mogl) wants to insist on </p><p>hand-carrying because the results were not readable when sent </p><p>by secure fax during the recent exercise.  Mogl has not </p><p>approached Technical Secretariat support staff (IT, </p><p>Confidentiality) who might be able to offer him a better </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>technical option.  Del has since done so. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  Iran continues to raise political objections to </p><p>para. 9.1, insisting that "geographic distribution" of chosen </p><p>designated labs be mandated.  Wills continues to point out </p><p>that only European labs were available in 2000.  India listed </p><p>numerous labs currently suspended in support of Iran.  There </p><p>is a factual misunderstanding here by supporters of Iran, if </p><p>not by Iran itself.  This might be straightened out by a </p><p>forceful and clear spokesperson for the Technical Secretariat. </p><p>14.  (U)  In paras. 9.3 and 11.6, Iran demands the right for </p><p>the ISP to observe off-site analysis, because it is part and </p><p>parcel of inspection activity. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  Agreed changes: </p><p> </p><p>--    OP 2, request the Technical Secretariat to "further" </p><p>test and validate . . . Rationale:  to reflect the successful </p><p>sampling and analysis exercise. </p><p> </p><p>--    Para. 6.1, the UK requested the Technical Secretariat\'s </p><p>custody "is deemed to be" maintained by "the integrity of" </p><p>the fiber-optical seals.  However, the language will stay </p><p>unchanged due to objections from France, Japan and Del. </p><p> </p><p>--    Para. 6.3, France reserves until it studies the IATA </p><p>A-106 document used to apply the special exemption granted to </p><p>the Director General by IATA in 1993. </p><p> </p><p>--    Para. 6.4, Germany objected that the Convention says </p><p>the Director General shall be responsible for transport of a </p><p>sample, so the responsibility cannot be the National </p><p>Authority\'s.  Agreed fix:  "The National Authority of a </p><p>designated lab shall facilitate in-country transport of the </p><p>sample." </p><p> </p><p>--    Para. 6.5, delete "as necessary" because it is </p><p>grammatically part of the previously deleted verbiage. </p><p> </p><p>--    Para. 11.9, the ROK tried to insist on a third lab if </p><p>there is any inconsistency.  It should be possible to explain </p><p>to the South Korean delegation why this might not be </p><p>necessary.  The ROK del indicated they would accept "or, if </p><p>the issue is not clarified, select additional ones." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Ambassador Javits\' Upcoming Travel </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  Ambassador Javits will participate in site visits </p><p>at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Tooele, Utah the week of 14 July </p><p>and will return to Washington for consultations 18-19 July. </p><p>Ambassador Javits is willing to stay in Washington an extra </p><p>day or two if additional meetings are necessary. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U)  Javits sends. </p><p> </p><p>BAILY </p><p></p></div>
