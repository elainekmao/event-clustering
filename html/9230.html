<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001738 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/WCI - PROSPER/CROCK, EUR - BOGUE, EUR/SCE </p><p>- JONES/GREGORIAN, L/EUR - LAHNE, DRI - DAVIS, INR/WCAD - </p><p>SPRIGG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 FIVE YEARS AFTER CLOSURE OF ICTY </p><p>TAGS: BK, HR, NL, PHUM, PREL, SR, ICTY </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY: PRESIDENT MERON TO VISIT BELGRADE JULY 24-25 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by: Clifton M. Johnson, Legal Counselor, </p><p>Reason: 1.5(d) and 1.6. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) International Criminal Tribunal for the former </p><p>Yugoslavia (ICTY) President Theodor Meron has received and </p><p>accepted a formal invitation to visit Belgrade from Serbia </p><p>and Montenegro (SAM) Foreign Minister Svilanovic.  Meron,s </p><p>visit is scheduled for July 24 to 25 and is being pitched by </p><p>Svilanovic as a way to promote international justice and </p><p>strengthen SAM,s cooperation with the ICTY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The visit will, apparently, be given a high profile </p><p>with meetings promised with President Marovic, Prime Minister </p><p>Zivkovic, and Foreign Minister Svilanovic.  Meetings are also </p><p>being scheduled with key local judges.  Meron will be </p><p>accompanied by his Chief of Staff, Larry Johnson, and Vice </p><p>President Judge Pocar (Italy). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment.  Meron can be expected to press SAM </p><p>authorities vigorously on the need to enhance cooperation </p><p>with the Tribunal and to arrest Mladic and other outstanding </p><p>war criminals.  He is mindful of the need to make these </p><p>points while acknowledging important progress by SAM, and </p><p>views this visit as an opportunity to build a rapport with </p><p>SAM interlocutors that will prove beneficial to both SAM and </p><p>the ICTY.  He would welcome any additional background or </p><p>suggested points to raise during his visit. We believe a </p><p>meeting with Ambassador Montgomery and briefing from Embassy </p><p>Belgrade would also be very helpful.  If Embassy Belgrade </p><p>concurs, we would like to fix quickly the date/time for such </p><p>a meeting on the front end of the visit to maximize its value </p><p>and impact.  End comment. </p><p>BAILY </p><p></p></div>
