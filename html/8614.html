<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000520 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>Department for EAP/BCLTV and DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: PROTESTANTS IN QUIET STAND OFF WITH POLICE OVER NEW HOUSE </p><p>CHURCH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  A group of 50-100 Protestant believers has been working </p><p>around the clock for two days to construct a new (unrecognized) </p><p>branch church in HCMC, in defiance of local police and government </p><p>officials.  The situation has remained peaceful thus far, but at </p><p>least one pastor on the scene has encouraged his followers to </p><p>physically resist any attempts to stop construction or disperse </p><p>the believers.  Protestants working at the site say anywhere from </p><p>50 to 200 police and other local government officials have been </p><p>present at various times during the construction.  They accuse the </p><p>government of employing undercover policemen and hired thugs in an </p><p>attempt to provoke a confrontation.  Police  allegedly interfered </p><p>with the shipment of construction materials -- taking custody of </p><p>at least one vehicle, though after the supplies had been removed </p><p>by the Protestant believers.  Police have also allegdly warned </p><p>local merchants not to sell to the group.  In spite of this, </p><p>construction of the prefabricated structure, which began at 5:00 </p><p>am on June 9, is slated to be completed early on June 11 local </p><p>time.  Some pastors at the scene took the initiative, contacted a </p><p>Time correspondent in Hanoi, and were interviewed by telephone </p><p>today. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  According to regular ConGen contacts in the Protestant </p><p>community, the new church is being constructed on a parcel of land </p><p>in District 2 owned by a GVN-recognized Southern Evangelical </p><p>Church of Vietnam (SECV) pastor from District 9.  The government </p><p>ordered an earlier church on the same site demolished some years </p><p>ago, after which the congregation continued to worship outdoors </p><p>for several more months before the government finally clamped down </p><p>completely.  Local authorities have allegedly denied numerous </p><p>written applications over the intervening years to build a new </p><p>structure on this site.  The reason given is that while the </p><p>District 9 church has been recognized, a church on this District 2 </p><p>parcel of land has neither been approved for construction nor as a </p><p>"branch" of the older church.  Post\'s contacts admit that </p><p>officials at the ward level have apparently issued an order </p><p>explicitly denying permission to build and authorizing local </p><p>officials to remove any illegal construction.  But they also claim </p><p>that the HCMC People\'s Committee and Committee on Religious </p><p>Affairs have recently given them some form of unwritten, informal </p><p>consent to proceed. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  A Protestant pastor not directly associated with the </p><p>new church told Poloff this evening that the law actually allows </p><p>construction to begin if the government fails to respond to an </p><p>application for a building permit within three weeks.  ConGen is </p><p>unable to verify this assertion at this time, but this could be </p><p>the passive, informal "permission" on which these believers base </p><p>their case.  In the meantime, this same pastor believes the police </p><p>are unlikely to crack down on such a large group out in the open. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
