SUMMARY:  UAE MEDIA DEVOTED EXTENSIVE COVERAGE TO ATTACKS ON </p><p>THE MEDIA INSIDE BAGHDAD WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS FOR THE AL-JAZEERA </p><p>AND ABU DHABI TV OFFICES AND PERSONNEL.  "AL-ITTIHAD" OPINED THAT </p><p>THE ATTACK OPENS THE DOOR FOR ALLEGATIONS OF AN AMERICAN DESIRE </p><p>TO SILENCE THE VOICE OF TRUTH IN THE WAR.  ALONG THIS LINE, AN </p><p>"AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL CLAIMED THAT THE U.S. TARGETED THE ARAB </p><p>MEDIA TO COVER ITS PLANS TO COMMIT A MASSACRE TO ACHIEVE ITS </p><p>GOALS IN IRAQ.  AN "AL-BAYAN" COLUMNIST ASSERTED THAT THE U.S. IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL WARS IN THE REGION IN ITS EFFORTS TO CONTROL </p><p>REGIONAL RESOURCES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "HAS THE WAR AGAINST REALITY BEGUN?," </p><p>SEMI-OFFICIAL ABU DHABI-BASED ARABIC DAILY "AL-ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 4/9: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT THE WAR PROMISED AS A CLEAN </p><p>WAR HAS KILLED A LARGE NUMBER OF JOURNALISTS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS </p><p>WITH MANY OTHERS WOUNDED ... THE TRAGIC BLOODY SCENE OF THE </p><p>JOURNALISTS IN BAGHDAD YESTERDAY OPENS THE DOOR FOR MANY </p><p>ALLEGATIONS ABOUT A DESIRE TO SILENCE THE VOICE OF TRUTH AND </p><p>PREVENT THE HEROIC JOURNALISTS IN THE BATTLEFIELD IN BAGHDAD FROM </p><p>TRANSMITTING WHAT HAPPENS AND WHAT TRAGEDIES MIGHT OCCUR AS THE </p><p>WAR ENTERS ITS DECISIVE STAGE IN THE STREETS OF THE IRAQI </p><p>CAPITAL." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "TURNING OFF THE LIGHTS TO HIDE THE </p><p>CRIME," SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED </p><p>4/9: </p><p> </p><p>"... TARGETING JOURNALISTS IN BESIEGED BAGHDAD, UNDER FIRE THIS </p><p>VERY HOUR, IS A NEW CRIME THAT MUST BE ADDED TO THE LIST OF </p><p>CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE AGGRESSION (COALITION FORCES).  IT </p><p>REPRESENTS PART OF THE LARGER CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST THE ARAB </p><p>PEOPLE OF IRAQ BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD ... A MASSACRE NEEDS TO BE </p><p>COMMITTED TO ALLOW THE AGGRESSION TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS IN IRAQ. </p><p>THIS MASSACRE NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN COMPLETE DARKNESS, AND </p><p>THIS EXPLAINS WHY ALL LIGHTS MUST BE SWITCHED OFF TO AVOID </p><p>FURTHER SCANDALS ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  AN EDITORIAL IN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY </p><p>"AL-BAYAN" NOTED 4/9: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT IS REGRETTABLE TO SEE THE AMERICAN MILITARY SPOKESMAN, </p><p>FRANK THORPE TELL CNN THAT "WE HAVE TOLD THEM FROM THE BEGINNING </p><p>THAT BAGHDAD HAS BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE, A WAR ZONE.\' </p><p>THIS STATEMENT REVEALS THE FACTS BEHIND THE WAR OPERATIONS.  THE </p><p>SHELLING DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION UNARMED CIVILIANS, A </p><p>FACT REVEALING THE HIDDEN FACE OF THE WAR.  NO ONE CAN DENY THAT </p><p>WHAT HAPPENED WAS DELIBERATE TO HIDE REALITY AND STOP ANY </p><p>REVELATION OF WHAT IS OCCURRING IN IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE DIRECTOR OF DUBAI MUNICIPALITY QASSEM SULTAN WROTE IN HIS </p><p>WEEKLY "AL-BAYAN" COLUMN 4/9: </p><p> </p><p>"... IN THE FIRST WAR, AMERICA WANTED TO ELIMINATE THE (TWO) </p><p>REGIONAL POWERS, IRAN WITH ITS AMERICAN ARMS AND MILITARY MIGHT </p><p>FROM THE SHAH, AND IRAQ WITH ITS DEVELOPED WEAPONS AND ADVANCED </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CULTIVATED BY THE U.S.  IN THE SECOND WAR, AMERICA </p><p>WANTED TO COMPLETE ITS ROLE IN CONTROLLING THE REGION AND ITS </p><p>RESOURCES BY PLACING ITSELF AS A SPONSOR OF THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>INTERESTS.  HOWEVER, ALL INDICATIONS PROVE THAT THIS WAR WAS </p><p>PLANNED YEARS AGO BY ZIONIST HANDS ... (SUCH AS) THE ZIONIST </p><p>RICHARD PEARLE, THE FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER\'S ADVISOR ... </p><p>WILL AMERICA AND BRITAIN LEAVE IRAQ AND ITS RESOURCES AFTER THESE </p><p>TROOPS HAVE ARRIVED HERE?  SOME OF THEIR EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT </p><p>SUCH A WEALTH IS THEIRS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE BEST OF MANKIND, AND </p><p>THEREFORE, THEY CAN NOT ALLOW THESE UNDEVELOPED PEOPLE TO CONTROL </p><p>IT." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
