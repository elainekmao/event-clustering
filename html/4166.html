<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 003017 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, DRL, EB </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KJUS, PHUM, KCRM, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: PEELING A ROTTEN ONION-SUPREME COURT OUSTS ENTIRE </p><p>COURT OF APPEALS OVER CORRUPTION ALLEGATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Chief Francisco Palmieri; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: On October 23, 2002, in an unprecedented </p><p>move the Supreme Court suspended all three magistrates of the </p><p>Court of Appeals.  Magistrate Mario Alberto Guzman Zuniga </p><p>(Guzman) was suspended pending the investigation of </p><p>allegations that he took a bribe.  Guzman supposedly accepted </p><p>money from various Honduras Air Force officers who are </p><p>charged with pilfering money from the military retirement </p><p>fund.  The other two Court of Appeals magistrates--Dagoberto </p><p>Aspra Iglesias (Aspra) and Rita Ondina Nunez Barahona (Nunez) </p><p>have also been suspended after having attempted to file a </p><p>corruption claim against Guzman with the Inspector General of </p><p>the Courts.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>JUDICIAL CORRUPTION EXPOSED </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On October 28, 2002, the Honduran Supreme Court made </p><p>a shocking and unprecedented move when it ratified the </p><p>suspension of all three of the magistrates on the Honduran </p><p>Court of Appeals.  The act temporarily rendered the Court of </p><p>Appeals inoperative and raised serious questions about the </p><p>stability of the judiciary.  One of the three magistrates, </p><p>Mario Alberto Guzman Zuniga, was suspended pending the </p><p>investigation of allegations of corruption.  On October 24, </p><p>Aspra went public with allegations that Guzman accepted some </p><p>$5400 in bribes from Honduran Air Force officers who are </p><p>embroiled in a legal battle in which they are charged with </p><p>pilfering money from the military retirement fund.  (COMMENT: </p><p>Embassy sources indicate that much more substantial sums of </p><p>bribe money are involved in connection with the lawsuit.  END </p><p>COMMENT.)  Magistrates Aspra and Nunez were also suspended </p><p>after they attempted to lodge a complaint against Guzman with </p><p>the Inspector General of the Courts.  The Supreme Court </p><p>appointed interim magistrates to serve on the Court of </p><p>Appeals and will reportedly name permanent replacements by </p><p>the end of the week. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Nunez met with EmbOffs on October 29, 2002, to </p><p>discuss her role in the controversy.  Nunez portrayed herself </p><p>and Aspra as unwitting victims of a corrupt judicial system, </p><p>and maintained that their suspensions are political </p><p>retaliation for publicly blowing the whistle on their fellow </p><p>judge.  Nunez told EmbOffs that when she and Aspra learned of </p><p>the corrupt activities of Guzman, they attempted to lodge a </p><p>complaint with the Inspector General of the Courts (IG).  The </p><p>IG purportedly refused the complaint, asserting a lack of </p><p>jurisdiction to deal with the issue.  Moreover, Nunez asserts </p><p>that she and Aspra reported Guzman to the President of the </p><p>Supreme Court (Vilma Morales) on October 9, and that Morales </p><p>advised them she would "take care of it."  The </p><p>self-proclaimed whistleblowers heard nothing more about the </p><p>matter for 15 days, when Aspra decided to go public with </p><p>their allegations against Guzman. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>THE PLOT THICKENS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Nunez insists that her and Aspra\'s suspensions are </p><p>retaliation, and that there are corrupt judicial forces that </p><p>seek to remove them from the bench for other ulterior motives </p><p>unrelated to this case.  (NOTE:  She claims that she and her </p><p>family have received death threats, a common occurrence in </p><p>Honduras.  END NOTE.)  Nunez mentioned that there are at </p><p>least two other major lawsuits pending before the Court of </p><p>Appeals.  She charges these forces want the two of them </p><p>removed prior to the trials of the two cases.  She stated </p><p>that members of the Supreme Court--including Morales </p><p>herself--have personal interest in the other cases.  On the </p><p>morning of October 29, 2002, Morales told an AID official </p><p>that the Supreme Court has evidence that all three </p><p>magistrates are involved in the bribery scheme.  The Public </p><p>Ministry (Office of the Attorney General) is investigating </p><p>the entire matter, and Attorney General Roy Medina publicly </p><p>stated that, under the circumstances, the suspension of all </p><p>three judges is appropriate.  On October 31, the Supreme </p><p>Court is supposed to determine the fates of the judges in </p><p>question.  Nunez anticipates she and Aspra will be </p><p>terminated. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) This public airing of judicial corruption opens a new </p><p>chapter in the ongoing saga of the Honduran judiciary, which </p><p>has historically been fraught with corruption and subject to </p><p>political influence.  The 15 Supreme Court justices are the </p><p>first to be selected under a new system designed to </p><p>depoliticize the Honduran high court.  Supreme Court </p><p>President Vilma Morales has repeatedly declared her </p><p>commitment to clean up the court system and battle judicial </p><p>corruption.  This case could eventually result in the first </p><p>prosecution of a corrupt appeals court judge.  However, a </p><p>contact in the Casa Presidencial told the PolChief that the </p><p>removal of Nunez and Aspra was not a positive development and </p><p>was being engineered by Supreme Court justices who seek to </p><p>control the appeals court.  It is unclear whether or not </p><p>Morales is involved, but the Maduro cabinet official </p><p>indicated his concern about Supreme Court intervention in the </p><p>business of the Court of Appeals is not focused on her, but </p><p>on other Supreme Court judges. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
