<p>UNCLAS STATE 336019 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:   N/A </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, US </p><p>SUBJECT: AIDS TESTING OF VISITING U.S. MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL </p><p> </p><p>1.  PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS OF HOST NATIONS HAVE RESULTED </p><p>IN OCCASIONAL REQUESTS THAT VISITING MILITARY UNITS </p><p>DEMONSTRATE THAT UNIT PERSONNEL ARE FREE OF AIDS VIRUS. </p><p>THIS MESSAGE PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR RESPONDING TO </p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN, OFFICIAL ACTION, OR OTHER EFFORTS </p><p>BY HOST NATIONS TO CONDITION U.S. MILITARY VISITS ON AIDS </p><p>TESTING. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING COMMUNICABLE </p><p>DISEASES ON VISITING U.S. NAVY SHIPS AND U.S. MILITARY </p><p>AIRCRAFT, A HOST GOVERNMENT CAN BE INFORMED THAT: </p><p> </p><p>A.  A COMMANDING OFFICER OF A U.S. NAVY SHIP OR U.S. </p><p>MILITARY AIRCRAFT IS REQUIRED TO REPORT AT ONCE TO LOCAL </p><p>HEALTH AUTHORITIES ANY CONDITION ABOARD HIS SHIP OR </p><p>AIRCRAFT WHICH PRESENTS A HAZARD OF INTRODUCTION OF A </p><p>COMMUNICABLE DISEASE OUTSIDE THE SHIP OR AIRCRAFT.  THE </p><p>COMMANDING OFFICER, IF REQUESTED, WILL CERTIFY THAT THERE </p><p>ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL ENTERING THE </p><p>HOST NATION FROM HIS SHIP OR AIRCRAFT WILL PRESENT SUCH A </p><p>HAZARD. </p><p> </p><p>B.  CONCEALMENT OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MIGHT </p><p>SUBJECT A U.S. NAVY SHIP OR MILITARY AIRCRAFT TO </p><p>QUARANTINE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED UNDER DOD REGULATIONS. </p><p>ANY U.S. NAVAL OFFICER ENGAGING IN SUCH CONCEALMENT WOULD </p><p>BE LIABLE TO COURT MARTIAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IF ASKED WHAT THE U.S. IS DOING TO PREVENT THE SPREAD </p><p>OF AIDS BY U.S. SERVICE PERSONNEL, THE FOLLOWING </p><p>STATEMENT MAY BE GIVEN TO THE HOST COUNTRY: </p><p> </p><p>QUOTE  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE POLICY REQUIRES </p><p>ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL TO BE SCREENED FOR SEROLOGICAL </p><p>EVIDENCE OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) </p><p>INFECTION.  THOSE WITH POSITIVE SEROLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF </p><p>HIV INFECTION ARE ASSIGNED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.  IN </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS POLICY, U.S. NAVY AND MARINE </p><p>PERSONNEL DEPLOYING OVERSEAS IN U.S. NAVY SHIPS AND OTHER </p><p>MILITARY PERSONNEL ENROUTE TO PERMANENT OVERSEAS DUTY ARE </p><p>TESTED PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT.  UNQUOTE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE UNITED STATES VIEWS NAVY SHIPS AND MILITARY </p><p>AIRCRAFT AS SOVEREIGN.  THEREFORE THE U.S. WILL REFUSE </p><p>REQUESTS TO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS, TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC </p><p>INFORMATION ON INDIVIDUAL CREW MEMBERS, AND TO UNDERTAKE </p><p>OTHER REQUESTED ACTIONS SINCE THE CERTIFICATION OF THE </p><p>COMMANDING OFFICER IS DEFINITIVE.  FOR SECURITY AND OTHER </p><p>REASONS, THE U.S. DOES NOT RELEASE FOR ANY REASON </p><p>DETAILED LISTS OF PERSONNEL EMBARKED IN U.S. NAVY SHIPS </p><p>OR MILITARY AIRCRAFT VISITING FOREIGN PORTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FYI:  IN USING THE ABOVE GUIDANCE AND ADDRESSING HOST </p><p>NATION QUERIES, POSTS SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO AND RESIST </p><p>MEASURES WHICH DISCRIMINATE AGAINST U.S. MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL OR UNITS.  EXAMPLES INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>A.  REQUIRING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT U.S. MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL THAN VISITING MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>B.  TREATING U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL AS HIGHER RISK </p><p>GROUP THAN MERCHANT SEAMEN, VISITING COMMERCIAL AIRCREWS, </p><p>ETC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHULTZ </p><p></p></div>
