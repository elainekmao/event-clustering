<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 RANGOON 001644 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND INL/AAE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA AND FINCEN </p><p>DEA FOR OF, OFF </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p>JUSTICE FOR MARY LEE WARREN </p><p>MANILA ALSO FOR USED/ADB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, BM, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: A WA SELF-PORTRAIT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: A paper prepared by the Wa for international </p><p>visitors to their territories portrays their region as a </p><p>relatively poor, but developing part of Myanmar that is </p><p>struggling to rid itself of opium.  The Wa describe their </p><p>Special Region as an indivisible part of Burma, though they </p><p>also underline their continued interest in autonomy.  Some of </p><p>the points ring true; others; e.g., regarding the Wa </p><p>commitment to democratic principles, are simply hilarious. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  In paragraph 8 below is a lightly editted paper that was </p><p>drafted by the United Wa State Party last Spring for </p><p>distribution to international visitors.  While it is </p><p>obviously meant to present the Wa in the best light, it does </p><p>make some interesting points.  First, in a telling comment on </p><p>the real state of power relationships between the GOB and the </p><p>Wa, the very first line commits the Wa flatly to the Union of </p><p>Burma.  It states that "Wa State is an indivisible part of </p><p>the Union of Myanmar."  Autonomy is still an issue of </p><p>interest to them, but, at least according to this paper, </p><p>independence is not. </p><p> </p><p>3. The paper also provides a purported breakdown of revenue </p><p>for Wa State (as the UWSA calls its territories along Shan </p><p>State\'s borders with China and Thailand), at least in </p><p>percentage terms.  The interesting lines are the "allocation </p><p>from the Union government," which represents the development </p><p>and food subsidies provided by the GOB; the tax, which, </p><p>according to Wa Chairman Pauk Yu Chan, mostly represents a </p><p>tax on opium; and the "partner\'s share fund," which probably </p><p>represents the whole variety of kickbacks which the Wa </p><p>receive from criminal gangs operating in and through their </p><p>teritories. </p><p> </p><p>4.  There are no numbers for the value of the revenue, but it </p><p>is not hard to do some calculations from numbers which Pauk </p><p>Yu Chan provided to Poloff and representatives from the </p><p>German and British embassies on November 27.  According to </p><p>Pauk Yu Chan, about half the UWSP\'s revenue goes to pay the </p><p>salaries of members of the United Wa State Army and the </p><p>United Wa State Party, all of whom are paid at a rate of one </p><p>Chinese Yuan per day.  Assuming 25,000 personnel total in </p><p>both the UWSA and the UWSP, that works out to total </p><p>expenditures on salaries of less than $10 million and total </p><p>Wa revenues of less than $20 million. </p><p> </p><p>5.  That $20 million number for revenues is also roughly </p><p>compatible with figures Pauk Yu Chan provided for the Wa </p><p>opium tax.  According to Pauk Yu Chan, the opium tax, levied </p><p>at a rate of about 7 percent of the value of the crop, brings </p><p>in about 12 percent of the UWSP\'s total revenue.  Given </p><p>UNDCP\'s estimate of opium production in Wa territories (22 </p><p>percent of Burma\'s total crop; i.e., the equivalent of 120 to </p><p>160 metric tons), and a farmgate price of between $125 and </p><p>$150 per kilogram for raw opium gum in Wa State, the overall </p><p>value of the Wa opium crop would be somewhere between $15 </p><p>million and $20 million, and the take to the UWSP from the </p><p>opium tax somewhere between $1 million and $1.4 million. </p><p>While there are ways to move this number up or down (e.g., if </p><p>the Wa convert some of the opium to heroin, or tax only a </p><p>portion of the opium crop), the final total for the UWSP\'s </p><p>annual revenues will still probably come out somewhere in the </p><p>range of $20 million.  There is, of course, no way to know </p><p>whether the accounts in the paper are complete or if the </p><p>figures provided by Pauk Yu Chan are correct.  If they are, </p><p>however, then Wa financial resources may be a good deal less </p><p>than many assume. </p><p> </p><p>6. The list of public works completed by the UWSP over the </p><p>past 14 years is also fairly remarkable.  It is also probably </p><p>accurate.  Every visitor to the Wa territories is struck by </p><p>the sharp contrast between the state of development in the </p><p>territories controlled by the Wa as opposed to conditions in </p><p>GOB-controlled areas of Shan State.  Working phones, </p><p>hard-paved roads, and 24-hour per day electricity from </p><p>hydropower plants that are still only working at one-third of </p><p>capacity suggest that at least some of the Wa revenues (and </p><p>probably a large portion) have been invested in the </p><p>development of the region. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Finally, the Wa claim to have eliminated about half the </p><p>opium cultivation in their territories over the past 12 </p><p>years.  That proportion may be correct, but no one can really </p><p>tell since there were no international observers in the area </p><p>in 1990.  However, the Wa are wildly wrong regarding their </p><p>estimate of current production.  According to the Wa, their </p><p>territories now produce only 30 metric tons of opium per </p><p>year.  According to UNDCP, the total is probably somewhere </p><p>between 120 and 160 metric tons. </p><p> </p><p>8. Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>I.  Brief Introduction of Wa State </p><p> </p><p>Wa State is an indivisible part of Union of Myanmar, as a </p><p>minority autonomous region (People\'s Government of Wa State), </p><p>we only ask the Union Government to grant us more power in </p><p>self-administration. </p><p> </p><p>In the past history of Wa Region, it was a territory of </p><p>anarchy without organization and leadership.  In the period </p><p>of Communist Party of Myanmar, as the second stage in the </p><p>history of Wa region, there were mainly wars and few </p><p>constructions in the region, which brought only disaster to </p><p>Wa people.  Therefore, we seceded from the Communist Party of </p><p>Myanmar in 1989, established Special Region (Wa State) </p><p>Government, Myanmar.  The People\'s Government of Wa State has </p><p>subdivisions with different levels as follows:  County </p><p>Government, Town Government, Township Government.  There is </p><p>also a chief and secretary in every village.  We use these </p><p>governing entities to administer Wa territory.  Our principle </p><p>is governing with democratic means and laws. </p><p> </p><p>We mainly use persuasion and education in our administration, </p><p>and executive methods as a supplement. </p><p> </p><p>In past years, the Union Government has created a peaceful </p><p>and stable environment for our construction, supplied us with </p><p>great support in finance, materials, techniques, etc.  For </p><p>instance, the Union Government has given us hundreds of sites </p><p>in Mengsuk, Mohkuk and Phakant to exploit ruby and jade </p><p>mines, and permitted us to establish trading companies in </p><p>many cities in Myanmar.  We sincerely thank the Union </p><p>Government for its concerns and supports. </p><p> </p><p>WADP (Wa Alternative Development Project) and other </p><p>international charities have made great efforts to help us </p><p>with drug control in recent years; they have developed many </p><p>projects in Wa State and made some achievements.  The Wa </p><p>people express their sincere thanks. </p><p> </p><p>The Wa people have already understood that opium poppy cannot </p><p>bring them fortune but disasters, and opium has damaged their </p><p>health and mind, blocked Wa\'s development of productivity. </p><p>Therefore, the Wa State has made up its mind to eradicate </p><p>opium poppy growing, change its poor economic structure, </p><p>rebuild new communities, and increase the pace of social </p><p>modernization. </p><p> </p><p>II.  Revenue Resource </p><p> </p><p>1.  From the allocation of the Union Government     20% </p><p>2.  Incomes from trading business                   21% </p><p>3.  Tax                                             14% </p><p>4.  Partner\'s share fund                            21% </p><p>5.  Mine products                                   20% </p><p>6.  Tourism industry                                 4% </p><p> </p><p>III.  Development and Construction plan </p><p> </p><p>A.  Education: Thirteen years ago, there were only 20 primary </p><p>schools with 480 students in Wa region.  There are 289 </p><p>schools with 20,754 students now, including 5 middle schools. </p><p> </p><p>B.  Health Care: There were only 4 hospitals and 8 clinics </p><p>with 150 persons as medicine staff in Wa region 13 years ago. </p><p> There are 20 hospitals and 160 clinics with 590 persons as </p><p>medicine team in Wa State now. </p><p> </p><p>C.  Energy Resource Construction: Wa people used oil pine </p><p>wood and oil lamp for lighting in the long history.  There </p><p>was only a hydro power station with 40 kilowatts capacity in </p><p>the Wa region 13 years ago, which was not sufficient for </p><p>lighting in Pangkham.  In period of peaceful construction, we </p><p>have built 7 hydro power stations with 13,900 kilowatts </p><p>capacity in the past 10 years. </p><p> </p><p>D.  Road Construction: There were a few raw roads with a </p><p>total length of only 300 km in Wa region 13 years ago; the </p><p>total length of roads is now 3,000 km.  There are main roads </p><p>with 730 km in the northern part of Wa State, most of them </p><p>are paved with cubic stones, and more than 30 bridges have </p><p>been built with the roads.  Now all the counties are </p><p>connected with roads paved with cubic stone; all towns are </p><p>connected with raw roads.  We have achieved our Ten Years </p><p>Plan in road construction; the road system can basically </p><p>supply transportation in Wa State. </p><p> </p><p>There are standard roads paved with sand and rubble for 505 </p><p>km in the southern part of Wa State, with 47 bridges. </p><p> </p><p>E.  Local industry: Wa State has developed its local industry </p><p>in some sectors, such as Hongpang Distillery, Cigarette </p><p>Factory (40,000 cases per year as product capacity), </p><p>Goodhealth Jewelry, Longtan Tin Smelter (1,000-1,500 tons of </p><p>fine tin per year as its scale), and Pangkham Peace Beer </p><p>Factory. </p><p> </p><p>F.  Agriculture: We have invested more than (RMB)Y10 millions </p><p>in agriculture sectors, constructed Mengkar conduit and </p><p>Wanleng Dam as agricultural infrastructures, which can supply </p><p>irrigation to 23,000 mu (1 acre=6.66 mu) of paddy rice fields </p><p> (However, because of insufficient funds, few paddy rice </p><p>fields have actually been irrigated).  These agricultural </p><p>projects have been funded by Wa State Government, not </p><p>including local government\'s funds. Moreover, since the truce </p><p>and entering peaceful construction period, each division, </p><p>regiment of our troop can supply food for about 4 months by </p><p>itself.  The real action of troop\'s taking part in </p><p>agricultural and local construction encourage people\'s </p><p>activities; as a result, people\'s income increased 30% on </p><p>average. </p><p> </p><p>Alternative projects as follows: Wa State has developed </p><p>rubber plantations on 53,660 mu, tea on 8,000 mu, various </p><p>fruits on 6,600 acres and 160,000 teak trees.  It also </p><p>developed a breeding industry, establishing a pig farm in </p><p>Kyaing Teng and two chicken farms in Tachileik. </p><p> </p><p>Other alternative projects are under development. </p><p> </p><p>IV.  Drug control works </p><p> </p><p>The history of opium poppy growing in Wa region is more than </p><p>a hundred years.  It is impossible to eradicate poppy growing </p><p>in a short time.  Therefore, the Wa State Government made a </p><p>plan in November 1990 to reduce the poppy growing area </p><p>year-by-year, and to completely eliminate poppy growing </p><p>within 10-15 years.\' </p><p> </p><p>In the past ten years, the Wa State Government has done a lot </p><p>of propaganda about drug control among its cadres, solders </p><p>and common people.  The intention of eliminating drugs in Wa </p><p>State has been fully understood by every Wa person. </p><p> </p><p>In 1997, Wa State Government proclaimed the complete </p><p>elimination of poppy growing in the whole Wa region by the </p><p>end of 2005. </p><p> </p><p>In 1990, the estimated poppy growing area was 10,000 acres </p><p>with total opium production of about 60 tons.  In 1994, the </p><p>area was 8,000 acres and production was about 48 tons, and </p><p>5,000 acres in 2000 with about 30 tons of total opium </p><p>production. </p><p>Wa State had destroyed great deal of drugs and processing </p><p>mills in Namteng, Nawi, Hotao and Yawnting, etc, the value of </p><p>drugs and equipment is more than a hundred million USD. </p><p> </p><p>Reported by:  Pu Yu Chen (Bao Youxiang) </p><p>Chairman of Wa State Government </p><p>April 02, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>End text </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
