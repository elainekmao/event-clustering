<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 DAMASCUS 000625 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 02/19/02 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, IS, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  ASAD WARNS THAT STRIKING IRAQ WOULD CREATE </p><p>          CHAOS IN REGION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  FBIS 171750Z FEB 02; SERIAL EUP20020217000115 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA PHILO L. DIBBLE, REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY. IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW WITH </p><p>ITALIAN DAILY CORRIERE DELLA SERA, BASHAR AL-ASAD </p><p>WARNED THAT A STRIKE AGAINST IRAQ WOULD DESTABILIZE </p><p>THE REGION.  HE ALSO DENIED THAT SYRIAN OIL IMPORTS OF </p><p>IRAQI OIL VIOLATED UNSCRS; REPEATED SYRIA\'S COMMITMENT </p><p>TO A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE; SAID THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION </p><p>LACKS A CLEAR VISION REGARDING THE MEPN AND SPEAKS </p><p>WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF VOICES; CLAIMED A "FREE PRESS" </p><p>AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES AMONG THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS </p><p>PRESIDENCY; SAID INDIVIDUAL HUMAN RIGHTS MUST NOT </p><p>CONFLICT WITH THE RIGHTS OF SOCIETY; SAID HIS PERSONAL </p><p>INTERESTS INCLUDE EXERCISING, READING ABOUT HISTORY, </p><p>COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND "ANYTHING DIGITAL;" AND CALLED </p><p>FOR INCREASED DIRECT CONTACTS BETWEEN THE WEST AND </p><p>MUSLIM COUNTRIES TO OVERCOME GLOBAL MISUNDERSTANDING. </p><p>ASAD\'S INTERVIEW WAS NOTEWORTHY FOR THE WIDE RANGE OF </p><p>SUBJECTS DISCUSSED, HIS EVIDENT SELF-CONFIDENCE, AND </p><p>THE EVOLUTION OF A PROFESSORIAL STYLE THAT RESULTS IN </p><p>LENGTHY (AND SOMETIMES UNWISE) EXPLANATIONS OF SYRIAN </p><p>POSITIONS.  HE REMAINS, IN OUR VIEW, VERY MUCH A WORK </p><p>IN PROGRESS, BUT ONE WHOSE PROFESSED INTEREST IN </p><p>ENGAGING THE WEST IS WORTH TESTING.   END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN AN INTERVIEW  PUBLISHED IN THE ITALIAN </p><p>DAILY "CORRIERE DELLA SERA," IN ADVANCE OF HIS 19 </p><p>FEBRUARY VISIT TO ITALY, SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL- </p><p>ASAD COVERED TOPICS RANGING FROM IRAQ AND THE MEPN TO </p><p>HIS HOBBIES.  THREE VERSIONS OF THE INTERVIEW </p><p>APPEARED:  THE CORRIERE DELLA SERA PUBLISHED EXCERPTS </p><p>OF THE INTERVIEW IN ITALIAN (TRANSLATED BY FBIS IN </p><p>REFTEL), WHILE SYRIAN AND REGIONAL ARABIC MEDIA </p><p>PUBLISHED A LONGER "FULL TEXT" IN ARABIC, AND THE </p><p>SYRIA TIMES PUBLISHED A "FULL TEXT" IN ENGLISH THAT </p><p>INCLUDED ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS THAT WERE NOT IN THE </p><p>ITALIAN OR ARABIC VERSIONS.   HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SYRIA </p><p>TIMES VERSION OF THE INTERVIEW FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>WARNING ON IRAQ </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) "WHAT I ASK MYSELF IS THIS:   IS THERE ANY </p><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR AN ATTACK ON IRAQ?   DOES AN ATTACK </p><p>BY ANY CHANCE FORM PART OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM?   IN ATTACKING IRAQ DOES ONE DEFEND JUSTICE </p><p>AND DEMOCRACY, OR DOES ONE FUEL PRECISELY INJUSTICE </p><p>AND THE ABSENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS?   I BELIEVE THAT AN </p><p>ATTACK WOULD BE AGAINST JUSTICE AND AGAINST HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS.   ALL THE ARAB AND MUSLIM COUNTRIES, WITHOUT </p><p>EXCEPTION, ARE OPPOSED TO IT.  AND ALL THE EUROPEAN </p><p>ENVOYS WITH WHOM I HAVE MET, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, HAVE </p><p>EXPRESSED THEMSELVES IN THE SAME WAY." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) "AN ATTACK ON IRAQ WOULD BE EXTREMELY SERIOUS. </p><p>THE PEOPLE\'S WRATH WOULD BECOME FAR MORE DANGEROUS </p><p>THAN POLITICAL REACTIONS.   I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>UNITED STATES NEEDS TO ATTRACT ANY FURTHER HATRED." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>SYRIA/IRAQ PIPELINE NOT A VIOLATION? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) FROM ARABIC VERSION:  "CONCERNING THE OIL, WE </p><p>ANNOUNCED OUR OPINION VERY CLEARLY FROM THE BEGINNING. </p><p>WE SAID THAT THERE WAS OLD OIL PIPELINE BETWEEN US AND </p><p>IRAQ THAT WE TESTED LAST YEAR.  WHEN WE SAY WE ARE </p><p>TESTING, WE ARE DEFINITELY TESTING IT WITH OIL AND NOT </p><p>WITH WATER OR AIR.  AND CERTAINLY THE DIRECTION IS </p><p>FROM IRAQ TO SYRIA BECAUSE WE HAVE NO OIL TO SEND TO </p><p>IRAQ.  AND I HAVE SAID THIS TO AMERICAN OFFICIALS. </p><p>BUT THIS IS A VERY OLD PIPELINE THAT HAS BEEN THERE </p><p>SINCE THE FIFTIES, AND WHEN WE HAD OUR POLITICAL </p><p>DIFFERENCES WITH IRAQ, THIS PIPELINE WAS NOT USED. </p><p>ITS OPERATION IS DIFFICULT, WHICH PROMPTED US TO </p><p>ANNOUNCE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A NEW PIPELINE </p><p>WITH MUCH BIGGER CAPACITY.  AND WE WERE DISCUSSING </p><p>THIS PIPELINE WITH COUNTRIES IN THE REGION AND WITH </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  AND WE SAID THAT WITH THIS NEW </p><p>PIPELINE OR IN ANY OIL TRANSACTIONS WITH IRAQ, WE WILL </p><p>ABIDE BY UN RESOLUTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) THE SYRIA TIMES VERSION ADDS:  "AND WE SAID </p><p>THAT WITH THIS NEW PIPELINE WITH IRAQ, WE ARE GOING TO </p><p>BE COMMITTED TO UN RESOLUTIONS AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO </p><p>SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR A MEETING THAT THE UN SHOULD </p><p>CONVENE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AT THE END OF LAST SUMMER, </p><p>AND THEN THIS MEETING WAS POSTPONED.  AND THEREFORE, </p><p>WE ARE NOT VIOLATING ANY U.N. RESOLUTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>NO CONDITIONS FOR PEACE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) "SYRIA HAS NEVER SET ANY CONDITIONS, AND WE </p><p>ALWAYS SAY THAT SYRIA DOES NOT HAVE CERTAIN CONDITIONS </p><p>AT ALL.  WHEN SYRIA SPEAKS ABOUT THE BASES FOR PEACE </p><p>IT REFERS TO THE NECESSITY OF IMPLEMENTING SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND MADRID\'S TERMS OF REFERENCE. </p><p>THESE TERMS OF REFERENCE WERE NOT INVENTED BY SYRIA, </p><p>RATHER THEY WERE AMERICAN IDEAS AND THEY BECAME </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RESOLUTIONS ONCE THEY WERE APPROVED BY </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. ... HENCE, OUR CONDITIONS </p><p>ARE THE CONDITIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND </p><p>THEY STIPULATE THE FULL RETURN OF SYRIAN RIGHTS." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>AMERICA HAS NO VISION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) "UNTIL NOW THE ROLE THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO </p><p>EUROPE BY THE UNITED STATES IS TO MARKET AMERICAN </p><p>IDEAS, BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN ALLOWED TO PLAY A ROLE OF </p><p>ITS OWN MAKING.  BUT EVEN THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION </p><p>DOESN\'T HAVE A CLEAR VISION OF HOW TO CONDUCT THIS </p><p>PEACE PROCESS. ...I CAN\'T SEE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>ARE PREPARED FOR THIS ROLE UNLESS EUROPE WANTS TO PLAY </p><p>THIS ROLE IN AN INDEPENDENT FASHION." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>AND SPEAKS WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF VOICES </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) "I THINK THAT IF THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION </p><p>IS ABLE TO FORMULATE A SINGLE OPINION, THEN THEY COULD </p><p>PROBABLY HAVE COOPERATION WITH EUROPE.  BUT YOU NEED </p><p>FIRST TO HAVE A SINGLE OPINION.  THIS IS WHAT I SAID </p><p>TO WILLIAM BURNS, THE U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF </p><p>STATE, WHEN HE VISITED ME IN DAMASCUS TWO MONTHS AGO. </p><p>I SAID TO HIM: YOU ARE A GROUP OF ADMINISTRATIONS, NOT </p><p>JUST ONE ADMINISTRATION.  EACH ONE OF YOUR </p><p>ADMINISTRATIONS HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>LEBANON: OUR PRESENCE IS TEMPORARY </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) "WE DON\'T BUILD OUR RELATIONS WITH LEBANON ON </p><p>THE BASIS OF THE MILITARY PRESENCE. ...THE PRESENCE IS </p><p>A TEMPORARY ONE.  I THINK THE ACTUAL ACT OF </p><p>REDEPLOYMENT IS SUBJECT TO A MILITARY FACTOR AND THE </p><p>CONDITIONS THAT INFLUENCE THIS, PARTICULARLY THE SOUTH </p><p>OF LEBANON AND THE ISRAELI SITUATION." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) [ASKED ABOUT SYRIAN RELATIONS WITH ELIE </p><p>HOBEIKA]  "IN FACT, THE ONE WHO SUPERVISED AND </p><p>INITIATED THE KILLINGS IS SHARON PERSONALLY." (ASAD </p><p>DID NOT MENTION HOBEIKA.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>GET TO THE ROOT CAUSES OF TERRORISM </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) [REGARDING SUICIDE BOMBERS] "I CAN BRIEFLY </p><p>SAY THAT THE FRAME OF MIND THAT PUSHES PEOPLE TO DIE </p><p>IS THE RESULT OF THE ACCUMULATION OF HUGE FRUSTRATION </p><p>AND OPPRESSION THAT IS PRACTICED AGAINST THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  WHETHER THE WEST AGREES OR </p><p>DIFFERS WITH THEM, THEY ARE THE RESULT OF ISRAELI </p><p>TERRORISM AGAINST THEM.  WESTERN OFFICIALS WASTE THEIR </p><p>TIME IN CONDEMNING THESE PEOPLE.  WHY DON\'T THEY GET </p><p>REALISTIC AND GO BACK TO THE ROOT CAUSES?  THESE </p><p>PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IF THEY DON\'T GO DIE IN ISRAEL, </p><p>THEY ARE GOING TO BE KILLED IN THEIR OWN HOUSES, </p><p>BECAUSE SHARON IS COMING TO THEM IN THEIR HOUSES. .WE </p><p>THINK, REGARDLESS OF OUR OWN PERSONAL OPINIONS, THAT </p><p>THE ONLY SOLUTION  IS TO ADDRESS THE REAL CAUSE OF </p><p>THIS PROBLEM BY EXERTING PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO STOP </p><p>KILLING THE PALESTINIANS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>SYRIAN UN REP COMMENTS ON 9/11 </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) [NO APOLOGY, BUT A LENGTHY EXPLANATION ABOUT </p><p>DIFFERING FRAMES OF REFERENCE; ESSENTIALLY, PEOPLE </p><p>FEEL MOST STRONGLY WHAT IS RELEVANT TO THEM AND THE </p><p>COMPARISON WAS BETWEEN 9/11 AND THE ACCUMULATION OF </p><p>THE PAIN INFLICTED UPON PALESTINIANS AND ARABS BY </p><p>ISRAEL SINCE 1948.] </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ISLAM AND THE WEST </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) IS THERE A BOOK FOR WESTERN READERS THAT CAN </p><p>EXPLAIN THE RELATION BETWEEN THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND THE </p><p>WESTERN WORLD?]  "REGRETTABLY, MOST OF THE BOOKS </p><p>AVAILABLE NOW ARE WRITTEN BY NON-MUSLIMS. WE ARE DOING </p><p>SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN SYRIA, WE ARE TRYING TO CALL </p><p>FOR OTHER COUNTRIES TO CONDUCT WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS </p><p>ABOUT ISLAM.  THIS IS WHAT WE DID WITH THE AMERICANS </p><p>AND THE EUROPEANS; WE SHALL CONTINUE THESE DIALOGUES </p><p>WITH DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD ABOUT MEDIA, </p><p>ACADEMIA, CULTURE, AND BUSINESS.  I ADVISE THAT DIRECT </p><p>CONTACT, PERSONAL CONTACT BE ESTABLISHED." </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) "FIRST, WE SAY HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT WE CAN\'T </p><p>SEPARATE BETWEEN THE RIGHT OF ONE PERSON AND THE RIGHT </p><p>OF SOCIETY.  SECOND, WHEN WE SAY THE RIGHT OF ONE </p><p>PERSON, IT MEANS HIS RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE </p><p>IMPROVEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY, BUT HE HAS </p><p>NO RIGHT TO UNDERMINE THE INTEREST OF HIS COUNTRY.  I </p><p>THINK THAT SOCIETIES HAVE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS OF THESE </p><p>RIGHTS ACCORDING TO THEIR CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS.  THEREFORE, THE POLITICAL PRISONERS YOU </p><p>HAVE TALKED ABOUT WERE IMPRISONED BECAUSE THERE WERE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE DIFFICULT AND THEY HARMED THE </p><p>REAL INTEREST OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY.  THE LARGE NUMBER </p><p>OF POLITICAL PRISONERS THAT WERE LET FREE WAS DURING </p><p>THE TIME OF THE LATE PRESIDENT HAFIZ AL-ASAD, BECAUSE </p><p>THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS PRESIDENCY? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) "WE HAVE ISSUED LAWS IN MANY DOMAINS.  WE </p><p>STARTED LARGE SCALE TRAINING OF PEOPLE IN COOPERATION </p><p>WITH THE EU IN DIFFERENT FIELDS.  WE STARTED A GREATER </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF ORDINARY PEOPLE TO HELP IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE DOING THEIR WORK.  WE </p><p>ACTIVATED A REAL DIALOGUE AMONG THE SYRIAN PEOPLE </p><p>ABOUT THE SYRIAN VISION OF THE FUTURE. ...WE PERMITTED </p><p>PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES IN SYRIA AND WE ALLOWED FREE </p><p>PRESS IN SYRIA!  A FEW WEEKS AGO WE STARTED </p><p>INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING STATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>PERSONAL QUESTIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U) [ASKED WHETHER BEING A PRESIDENT WAS </p><p>RESTRICTIVE, SINCE HE COULDN\'T GO TO THE CINEMA LIKE </p><p>ORDINARY FOLKS.]  "I DON\'T HAVE THE HOBBY OF GOING TO </p><p>THE CINEMA, BUT I LIKE TO MEET PEOPLE A LOT.  AND I DO </p><p>THAT, I MIX WITH PEOPLE JUST AS I USED TO DO BEFORE I </p><p>BECAME A PRESIDENT, BUT LESS OFTEN BECAUSE I HAVE LESS </p><p>TIME." [INTERVIEWER: AND WHAT IS YOUR HOBBY?] "I </p><p>EXERCISE A LOT AND I READ A LOT."  [ABOUT WHAT?] </p><p>"MOSTLY HISTORY.  AND I LOVE TO GET TO KNOW NEW </p><p>INVENTIONS, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE COMPUTER AND NEW </p><p>TECHNOLOGY, EVERYTHING DIGITAL."  [ARE YOU FOND OF </p><p>FOOTBALL CLUBS?]  "NO." [NOT EVEN WHEN YOU WERE IN </p><p>LONDON?]  "NO." </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) COMMENT:  NOW APPARENTLY A STANDARD PRACTICE </p><p>IN ADVANCE OF VISITS ABROAD, ASAD\'S INTERVIEW WAS </p><p>NOTEWORTHY FOR THE WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS DISCUSSED, </p><p>HIS EVIDENT SELF-CONFIDENCE, AND THE EVOLUTION OF A </p><p>PROFESSORIAL STYLE THAT RESULTS IN LENGTHY (AND </p><p>SOMETIMES UNWISE) EXPLANATIONS OF SYRIAN POSITIONS. </p><p>HIS ACCOUNT OF WHY SYRIA\'S ILLICIT OIL IMPORTS FROM </p><p>IRAQ ARE NOT VIOLATING UNSCRS IS UNINFORMED OR </p><p>DISINGENUOUS.  HIS TALLYING OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS, IF </p><p>LESS OUT OF SYNC WITH REALITY THAN BA\'THI PROPAGANDA, </p><p>STILL STRAINS THE CREDULITY OF OBJECTIVE OBSERVERS. </p><p>WE WERE STRUCK BY HIS WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS PURELY </p><p>PERSONAL TOPICS.  HIS PREFERENCES (A COMPLETE LACK OF </p><p>INTEREST IN FOOTBALL; INTEREST IN EXERCISE AND A </p><p>PASSION FOR TECHNOLOGY) SET HIM FAR APART FROM THE OLD </p><p>GUARD OBSERVERS ON WHOM HE STILL DEPENDS.  HE REMAINS, </p><p>IN OUR VIEW, VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS, BUT ONE </p><p>WHOSE PROFESSED INTEREST IN ENGAGING THE WEST IS WORTH </p><p>TESTING.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>DIBBLE </p><p></p></div>
