(SBU) Summary.  According to local press and contacts, the </p><p>Jordanian government may be on the verge of ratifying a new law, </p><p>heralding the creation of a new, free-standing, ministry of </p><p>environment.  Jordanian government officials believe the new </p><p>ministry will retain the General Corporation for Environmental </p><p>Protection as its core.  Enforcement of environmental bylaws </p><p>might remain an issue.  Speculation abounds on the identity of </p><p>the new minister.  Nevertheless, pleas are already being made by </p><p>officials for technical assistance to build the capacity of the </p><p>new entity.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Coincidental with the December 11 Washington meeting of </p><p>the FTA Joint Commission, at which environmental FTA issues </p><p>garnered significant attention (reftel), we began to see in Amman </p><p>visible movement on the long-stalled draft law to create a </p><p>ministry of environment.  Ambassador Alia Bouran, Jordan\'s </p><p>representative to Brussels and the EU, noted to the USDEL at the </p><p>Joint Commission that the law was with the cabinet for final </p><p>approval, which she expected by year\'s end.  Indications of </p><p>renewed activity on this issue locally was also reported in the </p><p>Jordanian media.  Faris Juneidi, Director General of the General </p><p>Corporation for Environmental Protection (GCEP), confirmed to </p><p>Regional Environment Officer that the long-awaited draft law </p><p>creating the ministry was in the final stages of review and </p><p>comment at the cabinet and that it is expected to be ratified by </p><p>the end of the year.  In a separate but related development, the </p><p>Prime Minister, while briefing the King on the Jordan First </p><p>campaign, said government efforts to protect the environment will </p><p>be crowned with the establishment of an independent ministry. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Juneidi commented that the draft law had changed little </p><p>from its original 2001 version, but could offer no explanation </p><p>for the long delay or the apparent sudden revival.  (Other </p><p>environment contacts thought the recent burst of activity was </p><p>linked to the FTA Joint Commission meeting and the desire of the </p><p>Jordanian government to meet its commitments and leverage </p><p>environmental technical assistance.)  He was confident, however, </p><p>that GCEP would constitute the core of the new ministry, but </p><p>quickly added that it would not simply be a matter of "changing </p><p>the placard on the building."  By his own admission, Juneidi\'s </p><p>organization needs significant technical assistance to build its </p><p>capacity, especially in the area of professional development of </p><p>GCEP\'s personnel. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) When probed about the nature of the relationship between </p><p>the new ministry of environment and other ministries with </p><p>overlapping responsibilities (such as water, health, municipal </p><p>and rural affairs, and industry), Juneidi was clear that the new </p><p>entity would have the lead on environmental issues, nationwide, </p><p>but would necessarily have to coordinate with others.  He </p><p>stressed that the ministry would be full-fledged and on a par </p><p>with others.  Juneidi also welcomed the dissolution of the </p><p>Environmental Supreme Council whose unwieldy size (22 members) </p><p>and composition (most ministers as well as representatives from </p><p>the NGO and business communities) he thought had hamstrung its </p><p>ability to act.  On the downside, he was somewhat apprehensive </p><p>that the new ministry might lack the necessary teeth to make it a </p><p>credible player on environmental enforcement. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Other contacts within GCEP and the NGO community also </p><p>welcomed the establishment of a new ministry.  More forthcoming </p><p>than Juneidi on speculating about the identity of the new </p><p>minister, GCEP working level contacts suggested that Samer Tawil, </p><p>the current Minister for National Economy and Minister of State </p><p>(a position essentially without portfolio), might be the </p><p>candidate.  Although lacking a background in the environment, he </p><p>is a close confidant of the Prime Minister who has championed the </p><p>new environment ministry idea.  The appearance of Ambassador </p><p>Bouran at the Washington FTA Joint Commission, where delegation </p><p>head Salah al-Bashir, the Minister of Industry and Trade, </p><p>designated her the environmental lead for the forum, has also led </p><p>to wide conjecture.  Yet, despite Bouran\'s strong environment </p><p>credentials and background as the lead environment negotiator </p><p>during the FTA process, many in GCEP believe that she will not </p><p>get the nod--at least at this time. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT:  The establishment of a ministry of environment </p><p>comes at a propitious time--the Joint Environmental Forum of the </p><p>FTA is scheduled to meet within the next few months, at which it </p><p>is expected Jordan will seek technical assistance to build the </p><p>government\'s capacity to monitor and enforce the country\'s </p><p>environment.  Somewhat disconcerting is the refrain that we are </p><p>hearing about GCEP forming the core of the new ministry.  While </p><p>GCEP has some positive attributes, the fear is that the ministry </p><p>will be a change in name only, hobbling its ability to develop </p><p>into the dynamic body necessary to tackle the challenging and </p><p>competing issues.  It is also disappointing to hear that Bouran, </p><p>arguably the most qualified professionally and academically for </p><p>the new job, may not be rewarded.  On the positive side, however, </p><p>someone like Samer Tawil, with his close links to the Prime </p><p>Minister and strong track record as a competent decision maker as </p><p>Secretary General at the Trade Ministry, could fend off competing </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>priorities from other sectors and bring strong managerial skills </p><p>to develop a new environmental agenda. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
