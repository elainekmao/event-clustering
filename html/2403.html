SUMMARY: IN A DECEMBER MEETING, THE DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>GIA LAI PROVINCIAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CALLED LEPROSY </p><p>HIS MAIN PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN.  HE ALSO DISCUSSED </p><p>OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS, INCLUDING HIV/AIDS, AND </p><p>AMBITIOUS PLANS TO IMPROVE THE STAFFING/FACILITIES OF </p><p>THE PROVINCE\'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.  THIS CABLE WAS </p><p>CLEARED WITH OUR CDC REP IN HANOI.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>LEPROSY: PROGRESS, BUT ERADICATION STILL OUT OF REACH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>2.  VIETNAM HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN BATTLING </p><p>LEPROSY (HANSEN\'S DISEASE), REDUCING THE ANNUAL RATE OF </p><p>NEW CASES FROM 0.64 PER 10,000 PERSONS IN 1996 TO 0.23 </p><p>NEW CASES PER 10,000 PERSONS IN 2000.  THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>LATE 1990S, THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS PROVINCES OF KON TUM, </p><p>GIA LAI AND DAK LAK STILL PURSUED THEIR GOAL OF </p><p>ERADICATING LEPROSY BY THE YEAR 2000 (SEE REFTEL). </p><p>THAT GOAL WAS NOT ACHIEVED, BUT PROVINCIAL LEADERS\' </p><p>ADVOCACY HELPED LAUNCH A CENTRAL GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN TO </p><p>ERADICATE LEPROSY NATIONWIDE BY THE YEAR 2010. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE INCIDENCE OF LEPROSY IS HIGHEST IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS AND THE REMOTE NORTHERN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS, </p><p>WHERE IT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFLICTS VIETNAM\'S ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY GROUPS.  ABOUT 1000 OF VIETNAM\'S 13,000 </p><p>PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE LEPROSY RESIDE IN GIA LAI </p><p>PROVINCE.  IN A MEETING ON DECEMBER 13, DR. MANG DUNG, </p><p>THE DIRECTOR OF THE GIA LAI PROVINCIAL DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>HEALTH, TOLD CONGENOFFS THAT THE PROVINCE HAD REPORTED </p><p>50 NEW CASES OF THE DISEASE IN 2000, COMPARED WITH 471 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00055  01 OF 02  220631Z </p><p>NEW CASES IN 1994.  DR. DUNG ATTRIBUTED THE REDUCTION </p><p>IN LEPROSY TO CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS TO </p><p>EDUCATE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN PROPER HYGIENE AND </p><p>CARE OF LEPROSY PATIENTS.  THE PROVINCE HAS ALSO </p><p>REDOUBLED ITS EFFORTS TO DIAGNOSE THE DISEASE IN ITS </p><p>EARLY STAGES AND FOLLOW UP WITH AGGRESSIVE MULTI-DRUG </p><p>TREATMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  DR. DUNG LISTED TUBERCULOSIS, MALARIA AND GOITER AS </p><p>THE NEXT MOST SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS IN GIA LAI </p><p>PROVINCE.  HE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF MALARIA </p><p>CASES HAD INCREASED IN THE PAST YEAR DUE TO THE </p><p>WEATHER, THE PROVINCE HAD SEEN A 60 PERCENT REDUCTION </p><p>IN MALARIA MORTALITY AS A RESULT OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND </p><p>TREATMENT.  TUBERCULOSIS REMAINS A SERIOUS PROBLEM, </p><p>WITH THE DISEASE AFFECTING THREE PERCENT OF THE </p><p>PROVINCE\'S POPULATION.  THE GOVERNMENT REDUCED THE </p><p>INCIDENCE OF GOITER BY FIVE PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR, </p><p>ACCORDING TO DR. DUNG, BY PROVIDING IODIZED SALT TO THE </p><p>REMOTE AREAS WHERE THE DISEASE IS MOST PREVALENT.  DR. </p><p>DUNG ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE PROVINCE, </p><p>MALNUTRITION AND INADEQUATE MATERNAL AND CHILD </p><p>HEALTHCARE WERE SERIOUS PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>HIGH HIV RATE, QUESTIONABLE BLOOD SUPPLY </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  SURPRISED THAT DR. DUNG HAD NOT LISTED IT AS AN </p><p>AREA OF CONCERN, POLOFF ASKED ABOUT THE INCIDENCE OF </p><p>HIV/AIDS IN THE PROVINCE.  DR. DUNG SAID THAT 3300 </p><p>PERSONS HAD BEEN TESTED FOR HIV IN THE PAST YEAR.  OF </p><p>THOSE, 45 HAD TESTED POSITIVE FOR THE HIV VIRUS.  CG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00055  01 OF 02  220631Z </p><p>ASKED IF THE 3300 PERSONS TESTED WERE FROM HIGH-RISK </p><p>GROUPS.  DR. DUNG REPLIED THAT THE SAMPLE POPULATION </p><p>HAD NOT COME FROM VULNERABLE OR HIGH-RISK GROUPS; THEY </p><p>WERE ALL PEOPLE WHO HAD UNDERGONE VARIOUS TYPES OF </p><p>SURGERY AT PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT HOSPITALS.  AS SUCH, </p><p>DR. DUNG SUGGESTED, THEY COULD BE CONSIDERED RANDOM </p><p>SAMPLES.  WHEN CG ASKED HOW SAFE THE PROVINCIAL BLOOD </p><p>SUPPLY WAS, DR. DUNG SAID HE BELIEVED IT WAS SAFE. </p><p>WHEN PRESSED, HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PROVINCE "DOES </p><p>NOT HAVE STATE-OF-THE-ART TESTING CAPABILITY." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT: WE WONDER IF THIS POVERTY-STRICKEN </p><p>PROVINCE HAS THE RESOURCES TO TEST ITS BLOOD SUPPLY AT </p><p>ALL.  WE WERE ALSO STRUCK BY DR. DUNG\'S APPARENT </p><p>NONCHALANCE IN RELATING THE HIV STATISTICS - CDC STAFF </p><p>FAMILIAR WITH THE TESTING PROGRAM NOTE THAT IT WAS NOT </p><p>A RANDOM SAMPLE, AS ONLY SELECT SURGICAL PATIENTS ARE </p><p>SCREENED (THOSE THE SURGEONS CONSIDER HIGH RISK). BUT </p><p>EVEN WITH THIS SAMPLING BIAS, THE NUMBERS SUGGEST A </p><p>MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE MAKING. </p><p> </p><p>UNFULFILLED NEEDS IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>7.  DR. DUNG SAID THE PROVINCE PLANS TO CONSTRUCT A NEW </p><p>500-BED HOSPITAL IN PLEIKU AT A COST OF VND 32 BILLION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00055  02 OF 02  220631Z </p><p>(USD 2.2 MILLION).  SPAIN HAS PLEDGED USD 3 MILLION IN </p><p>ODA ASSISTANCE FOR EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES.  THE </p><p>PROVINCE PLANS TO SPEND AN ADDITIONAL VND 10 BILLION </p><p>(USD 0.7 MILLION) ON ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT.  (NOTE: THIS </p><p>IS A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT FOR THIS EXTREMELY POOR </p><p>PROVINCE.  REFTEL REPORTED THAT FROM 1975-97, GIA LAI </p><p>HAD BUDGETED ZERO/ZERO FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF ANY </p><p>NEW HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  DR. DUNG SAID THAT EACH OF THE PROVINCE\'S 12 </p><p>DISTRICTS BOASTS A 50- TO 100-BED HOSPITAL.  NINE OF </p><p>THESE HOSPITALS HAVE SURGICAL CAPABILITIES.  GIA LAI </p><p>HOPES TO BUILD SURGICAL WARDS IN THE REMAINING THREE </p><p>DISTRICT HOSPITALS AS WELL.  IN ADDITION TO THE </p><p>DISTRICT HOSPITALS, DR. DUNG SAID, EACH COMMUNE WITHIN </p><p>A DISTRICT IS SERVED BY A CLINIC, AND SMALLER HEALTH </p><p>STATIONS ARE SET UP AT THE HAMLET LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  DR. DUNG ADMITTED THAT RECRUITING AND RETAINING </p><p>TRAINED STAFF AT THE COMMUNE CLINICS AND HAMLET HEALTH </p><p>STATIONS IS PROBLEMATIC.  ONLY 17 OF THE 175 COMMUNE </p><p>CLINICS HAVE A PHYSICIAN ON HAND.  THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WANTS TO INCREASE THAT NUMBER TO </p><p>THE 50 PERCENT LEVEL, BUT SEEMED TO LACK A SPECIFIC </p><p>PLAN ON HOW TO ATTAIN ITS OBJECTIVE.  DR. DUNG SAID HE </p><p>WANTED TO PROVIDE MEDICAL SCHOLARSHIPS TO STUDENTS IN </p><p>RETURN FOR A COMMITMENT TO WORK AT THE ISOLATED RURAL </p><p>CLINICS.  "WE ARE LOOKING FOR INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>FOR THIS," HE STATED.  (NOTE: VIETNAM GRADUATES A </p><p>SURPLUS OF PHYSICIANS.  IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, ONLY </p><p>ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF GRADUATES END UP IN MEDICAL ROLES. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00055  02 OF 02  220631Z </p><p>MANY PURSUE CAREERS IN OTHER FIELDS, AS THEY PREFER TO </p><p>STAY IN THE BIG CITIES RATHER THAN WORK IN REMOTE </p><p>AREAS.  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE TWO EMBASSY FSN STAFF WITH </p><p>MEDICAL DEGREES WORKING IN NON-HEALTH RELATED JOBS. </p><p>POST ALSO KNOWS AN ETHNIC GIA RAI PHYSICIAN FROM GIA </p><p>LAI PROVINCE WHO WORKS AS A BUSINESS CONSULTANT IN HO </p><p>CHI MINH CITY.  HE WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO HIS HOME </p><p>VILLAGE, BUT HE WOULD NEVER COME CLOSE TO THE INCOME HE </p><p>EARNS IN THE CITY.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  IN RESPONSE TO CG\'S QUESTIONS, DR. DUNG NOTED THAT </p><p>CLEAN DRINKING WATER WAS CENTRAL TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH </p><p>OF A COMMUNITY, BUT THAT WATER SANITATION WAS THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEES.  SIMILARLY, HE SAID PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION </p><p>SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROVINCIAL SCHOOL </p><p>CURRICULUM, BUT HIS OFFICE HAD NO INPUT INTO OR </p><p>KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION IN THE </p><p>PROVINCE, AS THAT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>11.  WHILE DR. DUNG IS VERY CONCERNED AND IS ACTUALLY </p><p>BETTER INFORMED THAN SOME OF HIS COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER </p><p>PROVINCES, THERE WAS NO PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH </p><p>PROBLEMS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT.  FROM </p><p>A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT, ADDRESSING THE CAUSES OF </p><p>MATERNAL, INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY RATES (IN ALL </p><p>THREE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS PROVINCES) SHOULD BE A HIGHER </p><p>PRIORITY THAN LEPROSY.  ALSO, WHILE GIA LAI PROVINCE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00055  02 OF 02  220631Z </p><p>NEEDS A NEW HOSPITAL IN THE PROVINCIAL SEAT, THERE </p><p>SEEMS TO BE LITTLE INVESTMENT IN PERSONNEL AND </p><p>FACILITIES IN THE MORE REMOTE AREAS WHERE LEPROSY, </p><p>TUBERCULOSIS AND MALARIA CONTINUE TO TAKE THEIR TOLL. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE DISCUSSION WITH DR. DUNG ALSO RAISES CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT HIV/AIDS IN GIA LAI, AND BY EXTENSION, IN THE </p><p>REST OF THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  IN A VERY POOR PROVINCE </p><p>WITH EXTREMELY LIMITED RESOURCES WHERE HEALTHCARE </p><p>PROVIDERS STILL CALL THE AGE-OLD DISEASE OF LEPROSY </p><p>THEIR MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGE, HOW CAN THEY POSSIBLY </p><p>BATTLE A DISEASE THAT WILL REQUIRE MODERN AND EXPENSIVE </p><p>TECHNOLOGY TO DETECT AND TREAT?    YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
