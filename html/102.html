<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 DAMASCUS 07872 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR RAPHEL </p><p>PARIS FOR WINN </p><p>UNCINCCENT FOR POLAD LOWRIE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, KPRP, SY, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  SYRIA AND IRAN:  ALMOST A RETURN TO STATUS QUO </p><p>          ANTE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) DAMASCUS 7586, B) DAMASCUS 7844 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  BY CUTTING OFF OIL TO SYRIA, IRAN </p><p>SIGNALED ITS DISPLEASURE OVER THE MOUNTING SYRIAN DEBT </p><p>TO IRAN, SYRIAN POLICIES IN LEBANON, AND MOVES TOWARD </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT WITH JORDAN AND IRAQ.  BY ALL ACCOUNTS, </p><p>HOWEVER, PM KASM\'S VISIT TO TEHRAN DECEMBER 1-3 </p><p>PRODUCED AGREEMENT THAT THE OIL SHIPMENTS ARE TO BE </p><p>RESUMED.  THE IRANIANS CANNOT EXPECT SIGNIFICANT SYRIAN </p><p>PAYMENT FOR PAST OR PRESENT DELIVERIES, BUT NOW THEY </p><p>SEEM WILLING TO GO AHEAD ANYWAY.  THEY APPARENTLY HAVE </p><p>BEEN REASSURED ABOUT SYRIA\'S RELATIONS WITH JORDAN AND </p><p>IRAQ, AND THEY MAY HAVE BECOME MORE RESIGNED TO SYRIAN </p><p>POLICIES IN LEBANON. ASAD APPEARS TO HAVE EMERGED FROM </p><p>THESE THREE MONTHS OF TENSION WITH IRAN WITH HIS BALANCE </p><p>OF SOURCES OF AID INTACT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SYRIAN PRESSURE, IRANIAN COUNTER PRESSURE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE PERIOD SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER 1985 WAS ONE OF </p><p>HEIGHTENED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SYRIA AND IRAN.  FOR </p><p>THE FIRST TIME IN THE RECENT RELATIONSHIP OF THOSE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES, THE FLOW OF IRANIAN OIL TO SYRIA WAS INTER- </p><p>RUPTED.  AT THE TIME OF THE OIL CUTOFF IN LATE AUGUST, </p><p>WE BELIEVED THAT THE PROXIMATE CAUSE WAS THE EFFECTIVE </p><p>IRAQI BOMBINGS OF KHARG ISALND.  HOWEVER, THE IRANIANS, </p><p>AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, WERE ABLE    FAIRLY QUICKLY  TO </p><p>REPAIR THE DAMAGE DONE TO KHARG, WHILE THE OIL CUTOFF </p><p>HAS CONTINUED UNTIL THE PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN SUM, THE IRANIANS WERE SENDING THE SYRIANS A </p><p>SIGNAL.  THAT SIGNAL COINCIDED WITH SIGNIFICANT SYRIAN </p><p>PRESSURE AGAINST THE IRANIANS IN SEVERAL SECTORS. </p><p>FIRST WERE THE PALPABLY INCREASED SYRIAN STRICTURES </p><p>ON HIZBALLAH AND THE SIEGE OF THE IRANIAN-SUPPORTED </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS IN TRIPOLI IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY </p><p>OCTOBER, RESULTING IN A DEFEAT FOR THE FUNDAMENTALISTS </p><p>(AND THUS FOR IRAN).  IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD OCCURRED </p><p>PRINCE \'ABDALLAH\'S MISSIONS TO DAMASCUS, AMMAN, AND </p><p>BAGHDAD WHICH LED TO THE PRESENT RECONCILIATION WITH </p><p>JORDAN AND A SPATE OF RUMORS OF A RECONCILIATION WITH </p><p>IRAQ.  THESE DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRED AGAINST A BACKGROUND </p><p>OF THE MOUNTING SYRIAN DEBT TO IRAN, NOW POSSIBLY </p><p>AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS.  THE IRANIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS--AND STILL IS--UNDER PRESSURE FROM </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE MAJLIS WHO ARE ANGERED BY SYRIAN FAILURE </p><p>TO PAY ON THE DEBT; AND THE IRANIAN PRESS HAS RECENTLY </p><p>HAD SOME VERY UNSAVORY THINGS TO SAY ABOUT SYRIA. </p><p> </p><p>THE KASM VISIT:  THE HEAT IS OFF </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  BY ALL ACCOUNTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN OR HEARD, THE </p><p>VISIT OF SYRIAN PRIME MINISTER KASM TO IRAN DECEMBER 1-3 </p><p>ALLEVIATED MANY OF THESE TENSIONS.  WE HAVE NOT YET </p><p>FOUND SOLID CONFIRMATION THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE </p><p>RESUMED SHIPPING OIL TO SYRIA, BUT A WIDE RANGE OF </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS HERE--BOTH SYRIANS AND DIPLOMATS WHO HAVE </p><p>HEARD FROM THEIR EMBASSIES IN TEHRAN--HAVE BEEN IN AGREE- </p><p>MENT THAT SYRIA GOT ALL OR MOST OF WHAT IT WANTED ON </p><p>THE ECONOMIC FRONT.  MINISTER OF ECONOMY \'IMADI, WHO </p><p>TRAVELED TO TEHRAN WITH KASM, TOLD THE AUSTRALIAN DCM </p><p>THAT THE IRANIANS AGREED TO RESUME OIL DELIVERIES, AND </p><p>THE FRENCH DCM GOT THE SAME MESSAGE DURING A VISIT TO </p><p>THE IRANIAN EMBASSY HERE.  OUR JAPANESE COLLEAGUES </p><p>ASSERT THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE AGREED TO A NEW ONE-YEAR </p><p>SCHEME INVOLVING THE IMMEDIATE RESUMPTION OF OIL </p><p>SHIPMENTS.  (ACCORDING TO THE JAPANESE, THIS AGREEMENT </p><p>PROVIDES   1 MILLION TONS FREE, 2 MILLION TONS FOR HARD </p><p>CURRENCY, AND 2 MILLION TONS FOR BARTER.  IF SO, THE </p><p>IRANIANS ARE ONCE AGAIN DISINGENUOUS:  IT IS EXTREMELY </p><p>UNLIKELY THE SYRIANS WILL PAY HARD CURRENCY FOR EVEN </p><p>2 MILLION TONS, NOR DO THEY HAVE GOODS WORTH THE </p><p>EQUIVALENT OF 2 MILLION TONS TO BARTER.)  OUR KUWAITI </p><p>COLLEAGUES ASSURE US THAT THE PORTION (THEORETICALLY) </p><p>TO BE PAID FOR IN HARD CURRENCY IS TO BE DELIVERED AT </p><p>"SIGNIFICANTLY  BETTER RATES" THAN OBTAINED UNDER THE </p><p>PREVIOUS AGREEMENT OF APRIL 1985.  FROM SUCH REPORTS, </p><p>IT APPEARS THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT THEY </p><p>ARE NOT GOING TO GET MUCH HARD CURRENCY--WHETHER FOR </p><p>THE NEW SHIPMENT OR IN PAYMENT FOR THE OLD.  THE NET </p><p>RESULT IS A SYRIAN VICTORY ON THE KEY DEBT/PAYMENT ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MEANWHILE, ON DECEMBER 13-18 THE IRANIANS SENT </p><p>THEIR MINISTER OF ISLAMIC GUIDANCE, MUHAMMAD KHATAMI, </p><p>TO DAMASCUS (REF B).  KHATAMI WAS FULL OF WORDS OF </p><p>PRAISE FOR SYRIA, WAS WARMLY RECEIVED BY ASAD  AND BY A </p><p>HOST OF SYRIAN MINISTERS, SIGNED AN INFORMATION COOPERA- </p><p>TIVE AGREEMENT, OPENED AN IRANIAN CULTURAL COUNCIL IN </p><p>DAMASCUS, AND IN GENERAL GAVE A FURTHER REAFFIRMATION </p><p>OF THE RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE IRANIANS MAY HAVE GIVEN UP ON SOME POINTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  WE DO NOT WANT TO OVEREMPHASIZE THE POINT, </p><p>BUT IT APPEARS TO US THAT THE NET RESULT OF THESE PAST </p><p>THREE MONTHS OF INCREASED TENSION BETWEEN SYRIA AND </p><p>IRAN IS A RESOLUTION AT SOME EXPENSE TO IRAN.  IF THE </p><p>IRANIANS ARE RESUMING OIL SHIPMENTS AT THE PREVIOUS </p><p>RATE OR NEAR TO IT, THE LOSS IS AN EXPENSIVE ONE--WORTH </p><p>$1 BILLION/YEAR IN OIL.  ON THE POLITICAL FRONT, THE </p><p>IRANIANS HAVE GIVEN UP POINTS AS WELL, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS LEBANON.  THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE </p><p>OF THE KASM VISIT TREATED LEBANON IN A WAY TO SUGGEST </p><p>THAT IRAN NOW ENDORSES SYRIAN POLICIES IN LEBANON. </p><p>SINCE IT IS CLEAR THAT IRAN OPPOSES MANY OF SYRIA\'S </p><p>POLICIES IN LEBANON, THIS ENDORSEMENT IS A REMARKABLE </p><p>PUBLIC CONCESSION.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE DO NOT BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE PUT AWAY THEIR AMBITIONS FOR A </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST SHI\'A-DOMINATED STATE IN LEBANON, </p><p>ESPECIALLY SINCE IRAN\'S ALLIES THERE ARE NOT PART OF </p><p>THE SYRIAN-BROKERED TRIPARTITE NEGOTIATION.  WE WOULD </p><p>NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THE SYRIANS HAD PRIVATELY </p><p>MADE PROMISES TO THE IRANIANS ABOUT LEBANON.  THE PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT MAY, THEREFORE, NOT BE WORTH THE PAPER IT IS </p><p>WRITTEN ON, BUT IT DOES SUGGEST THAT IRAN MAY BE A </p><p>LITTLE MORE RESIGNED THAN PREVIOUSLY TO SYRIA\'S DETER- </p><p>MINATION TO HAVE ITS WAY IN LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>8.  AS REGARDS JORDAN AND IRAQ, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE </p><p>SYRIANS HAVE GONE TO SOME LENGTHS TO REASSURE THE </p><p>IRANIANS.  NOTHING HAS COME OF \'ABDALLAH\'S EFFORTS </p><p>FOR SYRIAN RECONCILIATION WITH IRAQ AS YET, AND NOTHING </p><p>IN THE COMMUNIQUE EMERGING FROM TEHRAN WOULD GIVE </p><p>REASON FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT SYRIAN WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH IRAQ.  AS FOR JORDAN, ASAD PROBABLY </p><p>AFFIRMED TO THE IRANIANS THAT HE HAS GIVEN UP NOTHING </p><p>AT ALL IN THE PROCESS, I.E., THAT THE RECONCILIATION </p><p>HAS INVOLVED ONLY JORDAN\'S COMING TOWARD SYRIA AND </p><p>NONE OF THE REVERSE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE IRANIAN CONCESSIONS ON DEBT AND LEBANON </p><p>ILLUSTRATE HOW IMPORTANT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SYRIA </p><p>IS TO IRAN.  THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE PUT EMPHASIS </p><p>ON THE SYRIAN CLOSURE OF THE KIRKUK-HOMS PIPELINE, </p><p>BUT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE PIPELINES, </p><p>THIS IS NO LONGER A COMPELLING ARGUMENT.  THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF SYRIA TO IRAN NOW IS POLITICAL.  IRAN </p><p>PLACES GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL VALUE ON NOT HAVING TO </p><p>CONFRONT UNITED ARAB HOSTILITY.  IT ALSO VALUES SYRIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN IRANIAN PURCHASES OF ARMS, ALTHOUGH </p><p>IRAN COULD PROBABLY FIND OTHER AVENUES TO MEET ITS </p><p>MILITARY NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  SECOND, THE RELIGIOUS-IDEOLOGICAL COMPONENT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT.  IRAN IS AN EVANGELIZING NATION, BOTH </p><p>ON THE ISLAMIC PLANE AND, PARTICULARLY, ON THE SHI\'A </p><p>PLANE.  LEBANON IS A KEY ELEMENT IN THIS MISSION; AND </p><p>SYRIA HOLDS THE KEY TO LEBANON.  MOREOVER, SYRIA IS </p><p>SYMPATHETIC WITH IRAN\'S CRUSADE AGAINST THE SUNNI OVER- </p><p>LORD OF IRAQ, WHICH IS A MAJORITY SHI\'A COUNTRY.  A </p><p>FACTOR OF POSSIBLE IMPORTANCE IS THE SHI\'A/\'ALAWI TIE. </p><p>MANY OF THE IRANIAN MULLAHS VIEW THE \'ALAWIS AS </p><p>HERETICAL AND DESPICABLE; BUT WE ALSO THINK IT LIKELY </p><p>THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE MULLAHS FEEL CLOSER TO THE </p><p>\'ALAWIS THAN TO THE SUNNIS.  FOR HIS PART, ASAD IS </p><p>FIRST AND FOREMOST A SECULAR BA\'THI, BUT WE NEVER </p><p>UNDERESTIMATE HOW DEEP THE ETHNIC STRAINS RUN IN </p><p>SYRIA, AND WE DO NOT EXCLUDE ASAD FROM THESE PREJUDICES. </p><p>THE \'ALAWIS SHARE WITH THE OTHER SYRIAN MINORITIES A </p><p>HOSTILITY TOWARD THE SUNNI MAJORITY; UNDER ASAD, THEY </p><p>HAVE PROCLAIMED THEMSLEVES TO BE ORTHODOX SHI\'A; AND </p><p>ASAD IS THEIR LEADER, AS WELL AS--AND PERHPAS BEFORE </p><p>BEING--LEADER OF THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ASAD, THE CONSUMMATE BALANCER </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  WE DOUBT THAT KASM WENT TO IRAN WITH ANY </p><p>SPECIFIC THREATS, BUT IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT ASAD </p><p>LET IT BE KNOWN POLITELY TO THE IRANIANS THAT HE HAD </p><p>OTHER ALTERNATIVES--IN PARTICULAR, TURNING TO THE </p><p>SAUDIS TO MAKE UP FOR THE CUTOFF OF IRANIAN OIL </p><p>DELIVERIES.  IT IS, HOWEVER, A COURSE WHICH ASAD WANTED </p><p>TO AVOID.  THE PRESENT SITUATION--OF HOSTILE BENE- </p><p>FACTORS--IS ONE THAT SUITS ASAD PERFECTLY.  WHILE </p><p>NEITHER OF HIS PRINCIPAL BENEFACTORS IS HAPPY, THEY </p><p>GO ON BEING GENEROUS--IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THEIR </p><p>MUTUAL ANTIPATHY.  THERE IS EVERY LIKELIHOOD, FOR THE </p><p>NEAR TERM, AT LEAST, THAT ASAD WILL BE ABLE TO GO </p><p>ON EXTRACTING LARGESSE FROM BOTH OF THESE GOLDEN GEESE. </p><p>FOR THEIR PART, THE SAUDIS APPEAR TO SEE SOME VALUE IN </p><p>THE SYRIAN RELATIONSHIP TO IRAN, AS THEY HOPE THAT </p><p>SYRIA WILL USE IT TO PRESSURE IRAN NOT TO ATTACK THE </p><p>GULF. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE REAFFIRMATION OF THE SYRIAN-IRANIAN </p><p>RELATIONSHIP DURING THE KASM VISIT TO TEHRAN INDICATES </p><p>THAT THE TENSIONS OF THE PAST THREE MONTHS HAVE ABATED. </p><p>AS WE HAVE SUGGESTED IN PREVIOUS REPORTING, THERE IS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE RESILIENCY IN THE RELATIONSHIP, DESPITE </p><p>THE PROFOUND DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO COUNTRIES\' CULTURES </p><p>AND IDEOLOGIES.  FOR IRAN, THE RELATIONSHIP RESTS ON </p><p>MORE THAN LEBANON OR A PIPELINE, IMPORTANT AS THESE ARE. </p><p>FOR SYRIA, THE ECONOMIC ELEMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT, </p><p>AND ASAD\'S ATTACHMENT.TO IRAN MIGHT FALL BY THE WAYSIDE </p><p>IF IRAN PERSISTED IN WITHHOLDING OIL (INDEED, WE STILL </p><p>AWAIT CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT OIL DELIVERIES HAVE </p><p>RESUMED).  YET, IT IS CLEAR THAT ASAD PREFERS TO HAVE </p><p>IRAN AS ONE OF HIS MAJOR BENEFACTORS, HE IS CONTENT </p><p>WITH THE PRESENT STATE OF THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR (THOUGH </p><p>AN IRANIAN INVASION OF KUWAIT OR A TOTAL DEFEAT OF </p><p>IRAQ WOULD PRESUMABLY ALTER THIS VIEW--WHILE A "MERE" </p><p>SUCCESS NORTH OF BASRA MIGHT NOT), AND HE SHARES WITH </p><p>IRAN AN IMPLACABLE HOSTILITY TOWARD IRAQ AND ISRAEL. </p><p>THE \'ALAWI-SHI\'A BOND MAY BE A FACTOR OF IMPORTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  BEIRUT MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EAGLETON </p><p></p></div>
