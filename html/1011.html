LESOTHO IS MUDDLING THROUGH AN ARTIFICIAL AND UNEASY </p><p>CALM ONE YEAR AFTER A REGIONAL MILITARY INTERVENTION TO </p><p>REVERSE AN ARMY MUTINY AND FORESTALL AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>OVERTHROW THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT. THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY </p><p>OF THE DRAMATIC EVENTS OF 1998 PASSED WITH LITTLE NOTICE </p><p>BY MANY HERE AND SEPTEMBER 22 APPEARED A DAY LIKE ANY </p><p>OTHER.  HOWEVER, THE POLITICAL POLARIZATION THAT </p><p>GENERATED THE AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 1998 POLITICAL/SECURITY </p><p>CRISIS IS FAR FROM BEING RESOLVED.  INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>MECHANISMS PUT IN PLACE WITH THE HELP OF REGIONAL PLAYERS </p><p>TO FACILITATE A PROCESS OF RESOLUTION ARE AT AN IMPASSE. </p><p>PLANS TO HOLD NEW ELECTIONS IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2000 </p><p>HAVE STALLED.  POLITICAL PARTIES ARE STILL AT LOGGERHEADS </p><p>AND HARBOR MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OBJECTIVES THAT ARE NOT </p><p>AMENABLE TO COMPROMISE. THERE WERE NO COMMEMORATIVE </p><p>EVENTS BY EITHER THE GOVERNING OR OPPOSITION PARTIES -- </p><p>EXCEPT FOR THE OPPOSITION COALITION\'S UNVEILING A </p><p>SCULPTURE DEDICATED TO THE "HEROES" OF THE ARMY WHO WERE </p><p>"MARTYRED" AS THEY DEFENDED THE COUNTRY FROM FOREIGN </p><p>"INVADERS."  AS A MEASURE OF THEIR RENEWED CONFIDENCE, </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER, THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER WERE TRAVELING OVERSEAS WITH NO WORRIES </p><p>ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE OF LAW AND ORDER DURING THEIR </p><p>ABSENCE.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF A CRISIS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. ON SEPTEMBER 22, 1998, AT THE REQUEST OF PRIME </p><p>MINISTER PAKALITHA MOSISILI AND WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF </p><p>THE HEADS OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>(SADC), MILITARY FORCES FROM SOUTH AFRICA INTERVENED IN </p><p>THE POLITICAL/ SECURITY CRISIS THAT WAS UNFOLDING IN </p><p>LESOTHO.  THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL DEFENSE FORCE WAS </p><p>SOON JOINED BY TROOPS FROM BOTSWANA WHO BATTLED WITH ARMY </p><p>MUTINEERS AND THEIR OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN HEAVY </p><p>FIREFIGHTS FOR THREE DAYS.  UNFORTUNATELY, BY THAT TIME, </p><p>NEARLY 100 PEOPLE WERE DEAD AND ARSONISTS AND LOOTERS HAD </p><p>DECIMATED THE COMMERCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN LESOTHO\'S </p><p>THREE LARGEST TOWNS, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL, MASERU. </p><p> </p><p>HISTORY, PRECEDENTS AND HARBINGERS... </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. IN 19941995 BOTSWANA, SOUTH AFRICA AND ZIMBABWE BECAME </p><p>GUARANTOR MEMBERS OF THE SADC TROIKA THAT WAS MANDATED TO </p><p>OVERSEE THE PEACE PROCESS AFTER ELEMENTS IN LESOTHO\'S ARMY </p><p>FOMENTED A PALACE COUP LED BY KING LETSIE III. THIS </p><p>GUARANTOR STATUS, UNDER A 1994 MOU, AIMED TO SUPERVISE A </p><p>RETURN TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE IN THE REGION THAT SADC </p><p>WILL NOT TOLERATE EFFORTS TO UNCONSTITUTIONALLY OVERTHROW </p><p>DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED MEMBER STATES. THE PALACE COUP </p><p>FOLLOWED REJECTION BY OPPOSITION PARTIES OF THEIR TOTAL </p><p>DEFEAT IN THE 1993 ELECTIONS.  OPPOSITIONISTS ALLEGED, </p><p>BUT DID NOT PROVE, ELECTORAL FRAUD AND VOTE RIGGING. THEY </p><p>USED THIS ALLEGATION TO PRECIPITATE AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>OVERTHROW OF THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. AS IN 1994, THE 1998 CIVIL STRIFE FOLLOWED THE </p><p>ELECTORAL DEFEAT BY THE SAME COALITION OF OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTIES WHO AGAIN ALLEGED THEY WERE VICTIMS OF ELECTORAL </p><p>FRAUD.   AN UNAUTHORIZED SEVEN-MONTH- LONG DEMONSTRATION </p><p>AND PALACE VIGIL BY OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS BEGAN IN AUGUST </p><p>1998.  OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS CALLED ON THE KING TO </p><p>OVERTURN THE ELECTION RESULTS URGED HIM TO INSTALL A </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY.  EFFORTS BY SOUTH AFRICA\'S </p><p>THEN VICE PRESIDENT, THABO MBEKI, TO MEDIATE A PEACEFUL </p><p>RESOLUTION OF THIS ESCALATING CRISIS PROVED FUTILE. </p><p> </p><p>5. THE PALACE VIGIL SOON LED TO AN ARMY MUTINY, THE </p><p>FORCED SHUT DOWN OF THE CAPITAL AND OF PUBLIC OFFICES, </p><p>ALONG WITH HIJACKING OF GOVERNMENT VEHICLES BY OPPOSITION </p><p>ACTIVISTS.  CABINET MEMBERS WENT UNDERGROUND IN FEAR OF </p><p>THEIR LIVES, AS IN 1994, WHEN THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER </p><p>WAS ASSASSINATED BY COUP PLOTTERS.  IN THIS POLARIZED </p><p>INTERNECINE ATMOSPHERE, THE SADC MILITARY INTERVENTION </p><p>SPARKED AN ORGY OF LOOTING, DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, </p><p>BURNING AND LOSS OF LIFE. THE PRIVATE RESIDENCES OF THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER, SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE CABINET, AND A </p><p>NUMBER OF HIGH LEVEL OFFICIALS WERE DESTROYED BY FIRE AND </p><p>THEIR ANIMALS WERE SLAUGHTERED.   A WELL-ORCHESTRATED </p><p>ASSAULT ON SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESS INTERESTS TOOK PLACE, </p><p>WITH CHINESE AND INDIAN BUSINESSES CAUGHT UP IN THE </p><p>FLASHOVER. SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONALS WERE RANDOMLY </p><p>ATTACKED, VEHICLES BEARING SOUTH AFRICAN REGISTRATION </p><p>NUMBERS WERE VANDALIZED. EXPATRIATE RESIDENTS OF LESOTHO, </p><p>INCLUDING NON- OFFICIAL AMERICANS, EVACUATED THE COUNTRY </p><p>IN LARGE NUMBERS.  IT TOOK THE SOUTH AFRICAN ARMY THREE </p><p>DAYS OF BLOODY FIGHTING TO SUPPRESS THE LDF RESISTANCE </p><p>AND THEIR OPPOSITION ALLIES WHOM THEY ARMED FROM MILITARY </p><p>WEAPONS INVENTORIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INAUSPICIOUS REMEMBRANCES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>6.THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN ONE OF MANY REVERSALS FOR LESOTHO. </p><p>AFTER EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE HIGHEST ECONOMIC GROWTH </p><p>RATES IN AFRICA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DECADE, IN ONE YEAR </p><p>LESOTHO\'S GROWTH RATE WENT FROM SEVEN PERCENT TO MINUS </p><p>EIGHT PERCENT.  THOUSANDS OF JOBS WERE LOST IN THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES.  THESE </p><p>NEW CASES OF UNEMPLOYMENT EXACERBATE AN ALREADY HIGH RATE </p><p>OF JOBLESSNESS AND THE ASSOCIATE STRESS ON HOUSEHOLDS </p><p>TEETERING ON THE BRINK OF POVERTY.  SMALL ARMS </p><p>TRAFFICKING IS ON THE INCREASE, HOUSEBREAKING AND STREET </p><p>CRIME IS RAMPANT, OPPOSITION PARTIES ARE IN DISARRAY, THE </p><p>ECONOMY IS WEAKER THAN IT WAS A YEAR AGO AND THE </p><p>ELECTORATE IS DESPONDENT. </p><p> </p><p>7. ONE YEAR LATER, THE ROOTS OF LESOTHO\'S CRISIS REMAINS </p><p>UNRESOLVED AND THE FUTURE PEACE OF THE COUNTRY IS FAR </p><p>FROM GUARANTEED.  A RELATIVE AND ARTIFICIAL CALM HAS BEEN </p><p>RETURNED UNDER THE SADC SECURITY UMBRELLA, BUT THIS CALM </p><p>IS ONLY ON THE SURFACE.  THE PEACE ENFORCEMENT PHASE OF </p><p>SADC\'S OPERATION BOLEAS ENDED IN APRIL 1999, AND WAS </p><p>REPLACED BY A SMALLER CONTINGENT OF SADC TROOPS WHO ARE </p><p>TRAINING THE LDF IN CIVIL/MILITARY AFFAIRS WHILE </p><p>REINFORCING CIVIC CALM.  THOUGH MOST BASOTHO ACT AS IF IT </p><p>IS BUSINESS AS USUAL, THE UNDERLYING POLITICAL TENSIONS </p><p>CONTINUE AND A LASTING SOLUTION IS STILL ELUSIVE. </p><p> </p><p>8. FOLLOWING LAST YEAR\'S MILITARY INTERVENTION, AN </p><p>INTERIM POLITICAL AUTHORITY (IPA) WAS FORMED (NOVEMBER </p><p>1998) TO PREPARE THE GROUND FOR NEW ELECTIONS SCHEDULED </p><p>AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS (MAY 2000).  DESPITE LACK OF PROOF </p><p>OF ELECTORAL FRAUD, THE GOVERNING PARTY WAS CONVINCED TO </p><p>ACCEPT NEW ELECTIONS AS A MEANS FOR SETTLING THE MATTER. </p><p>SINCE THEN, THE GOL HAS EMBARKED ON A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM FOR CIVIL SERVANTS, THE LDF AND OTHER </p><p>SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS. THEIR GOAL IS TO MINIMIZE THE </p><p>NEGATIVE EFFECT OF PARTISAN LOYALTIES IN THE PUBLIC AND </p><p>SECURITY SERVICES WHILE PROMOTING A NON-PARTISAN </p><p>MERITOCRACY FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS. THOSE SOLDIERS WHO WERE </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE LDF MUTINY ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME BEING </p><p>TRIED VIA COURTS-MARTIAL FOR THEIR PART IN THE ATTEMPTED </p><p>COUP AND OTHER INFRACTIONS AGAINST THE DEFENSE ACT (1996). </p><p> </p><p>MUTINY WITHIN THE ARMY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES OPPOSED THE RESULTS OF </p><p>THE 1998 GENERAL ELECTIONS -- AS HAS EVERY LOSING PARTY </p><p>SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN 1966.  THEY CALLED FOR THE KING TO </p><p>DISSOLVE THE GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH THEY KNEW THAT THE KING </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO DO SO. </p><p>WIDESPREAD DISTURBANCES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CAPITAL, LED </p><p>TO A SOUTH AFRICAN EFFORT TO MEDIATE IN THE PROBLEM. A </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN-SPONSORED COMMISSION OF INQUIRY -- THE </p><p>LANGA COMMISSION -- WAS CONVOKED TO LOOK INTO OPPOSITION </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF ELECTION FRAUD.  THE COMMISSION\'S </p><p>FINDINGS, WERE LESS THAN UNAMBIGUOUS.  THE LANGA </p><p>COMMISSION DID NOT FIND ANY PROOF OF ELECTORAL FRAUD, BUT </p><p>SAID THEY COULD NOT PROVE THAT NO FRAUD AFFECTED </p><p>ELECTORAL OUTCOMES.  CHOOSING TO INTERPRET THE AMBIGUITY </p><p>OF THE LANGA REPORT AS A VICTORY, THE OPPOSITION PARTIES </p><p>STRENGTHENED THEIR PROTESTS AND MADE THE COUNTRY </p><p>UNGOVERNABLE. CABINET MINISTERS ABANDONED THEIR POSTS, </p><p>WENT INTO HIDING AND THE CAPITAL WAS LITERALLY SHUT </p><p>DOWN.  A HANDFUL OF LDF JUNIOR OFFICERS TOOK PART IN WHAT </p><p>LATER LED TO A MUTINY.  ARMY OFFICERS ABOVE THE RANK OF </p><p>CAPTAIN WERE ARRESTED AND HELD IN THE MAXIMUM SECURITY </p><p>PRISON.  THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WAS FORCED TO READ AT </p><p>GUNPOINT A STATEMENT OVER STATE RADIO CLAIMING HE FIRED </p><p>28 OF HIS OFFICER COLLEAGUES AND SUBSEQUENTLY ANNOUNCED </p><p>HIS OWN RESIGNATION. IN THE FOLLOWING DAYS, WITH THE ARMY </p><p>IN MUTINY AND POLICE DISARMED, THE ONLY ORGANIZED ARMED </p><p>FORCES IN THE COUNTRY WERE MUTINEERS AND OPPOSITION </p><p>PROVOCATEURS.  THIS SITUATION BECAME UNTENABLE, AND </p><p>MOTIVATED THE PM\'S REQUEST TO SADC FOR MILITARY </p><p>INTERVENTION TO REVERSE THE MUTINY AND RETURN THE COUNTRY </p><p>TO LAW AND ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>10. THE GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARKED ON A PROGRAM OF REFORM </p><p>FOR THE LDF, THE POLICE AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY SERVICE </p><p>(NSS).  THE SADC INTERVENTION FORCES, KNOWN AS OPERATION </p><p>BOLEAS, HAVE SINCE BEEN REPLACED BY OPERATION MALUTI </p><p>WHICH IS AIMED AT RETRAINING AND REORIENTING THE LDF. </p><p>THE SADC/LDF TRAINING IS REPORTED TO BE GOING WELL AND IT </p><p>IS ENVISAGED THAT IT WILL BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE </p><p>YEAR.  AN INITIAL PLAN TO DISBAND THE NSS -- AFTER IT </p><p>FAILED TO INFORM THE GOVERNMENT OF THE OPPOSITION </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES\' PLAN TO STAGE A COUP -- WAS </p><p>ABANDONED.  THIS DECISION FOLLOWED AN OUTCRY FROM MANY </p><p>QUARTERS OF THE SOCIETY WORRIED THAT THE LCD MIGHT BE </p><p>ENGAGED IN AN EFFORT TO TRANSFORM STATE EMPLOYEES INTO </p><p>LCD PARTISANS. </p><p> </p><p>THE INTERIM POLITICAL AUTHORITY (IPA) </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. THE IPA WAS ESTABLISHED IN NOVEMBER 1998, TO PREPARE </p><p>FOR EARLY ELECTIONS, AND WAS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE THE </p><p>BASIS FOR A SOLUTION TO THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS IN </p><p>LESOTHO.  THE IPA IS MADE UP OF TWO MEMBERS FROM EACH OF </p><p>THE TWELVE POLITICAL PARTIES THAT TOOK PART IN THE 1998 </p><p>ELECTION.  THERE ARE 24 IPA MEMBERS, WHICH GIVES UNUSUAL </p><p>VOTING STRENGTH TO THE OPPOSITION COALITION WHILE ALMOST </p><p>ENSURING THE RULING PARTY\'S INITIATIVES NEVER CARRY THE </p><p>CONSENSUS. THE IPA IS SUPPOSED TO SET THE STAGE FOR NEW </p><p>ELECTIONS BY MAY 2000. THEY ARE TO AGREE AND MAKE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE NEXT ELECTION, </p><p>ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THE AUTONOMY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF </p><p>THE INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION (IEC), AMONG OTHER </p><p>MATTERS.  THE IPA\'S TENURE STATUTORILY ENDS AS SOON AS </p><p>THE RESULTS OF 2000 ELECTIONS ARE ANNOUNCED. </p><p> </p><p>12. SOUTH AFRICAN MEDIATORS RECOMMENDED THE IPA AS A </p><p>COMPROMISE METHOD TO ACCOMMODATE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE </p><p>GOALS.  THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES WANTED A </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY (SOMEHOW WITHOUT THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF THE RULING PARTY) BUT THE GOL OPPOSED </p><p>THAT AFTER IT WON SUCH A RESOUNDING ELECTORAL VICTORY </p><p>WITH SEVENTY NINE OF EIGHTY SEATS IN PARLIAMENT. </p><p>(COMMENT: THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES CHOSE TO </p><p>PORTRAY THE IPA AS A KIND OF POWER SHARING ARRANGEMENT OR </p><p>PARALLEL/INTERIM GOVERNMENT.   HOWEVER, THE GOL, AS THE </p><p>LEGITIMATELY ELECTED GOVERNMENT, REFUSES TO CEDE ANY OF </p><p>ITS AUTHORITY TO THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE, BUT DOES </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE IPA.  THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SADC </p><p>VIEWS THE RULING PARTY AS THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT -- AS </p><p>DOES THIS EMBASSY AND OTHER RESIDENT DIPLOMATIC </p><p>MISSIONS.  NOR HAS COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF ELECTORAL FRAUD </p><p>BEEN PRESENTED TO UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE </p><p>MOSILILI ADMINISTRATION.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>PROGRESS, OR LACK THEREOF... </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE IPA HAS COVERED LITTLE </p><p>GROUND AND MADE MINISCULE PROGRESS IN PREPARING FOR NEW </p><p>ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR. INTERMINABLE SQUABBLES BETWEEN THE </p><p>RULING LESOTHO CONGRESS FOR DEMOCRACY (LCD) MEMBERS AND </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MAREMATLOU FREEDOM PARTY (MFP), </p><p>THE BASOTHOLAND CONGRESS PARTY (BCP) AND THE BASOTHO </p><p>NATIONAL PARTY (BNP) HAVE WASTED INVALUABLE TIME. </p><p>POLITICIANS USED THE IPA AS A PLATFORM TO DENOUNCE ONE </p><p>ANOTHER AND HOLD FORTH ON THE APPROPRIATENESS OF INVITING </p><p>THE SADC FORCES TO INTERVENE IN THE POLITICAL AND </p><p>MILITARY PROBLEMS OF LESOTHO. LITTLE WORK WAS </p><p>ACCOMPLISHED ON ELECTIONS PREPARATION, THE IPA\'S MAIN </p><p>DUTY.  ATTEMPTS BY OPPOSITION LEADERS TO DERAIL OR </p><p>DISCREDIT COURT-MARTIAL HEARINGS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL </p><p>WHO TOOK PART IN THE MUTINY ALSO OCCUPIED TOO MUCH OF THE </p><p>IPA\'S WORKING TIME. (COMMENT: FROM 1970 TO 1993, </p><p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES RULED LESOTHO, AND </p><p>EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICES WAS DEPENDENT ON </p><p>POLITICAL AFFILIATION WITH THE BNP.  AS A RESULT OF THE </p><p>1993 ELECTION, THE THEN-BCP INHERITED A CIVIL SERVICE, AN </p><p>ARMY, A POLICE FORCE, AND AN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE THAT </p><p>WAS PROFOUNDLY POLARIZED IN PARTISAN OPPOSITION AGAINST </p><p>THEM.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVED THAT OPPOSITION LEADERS </p><p>WERE OPPOSED TO THE COURT-MARTIAL HEARINGS BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT THEY AND THEIR SUPPORTERS COULD BE </p><p>IMPLICATED IN SUBORNING MUTINY AS A PRELUDE TO AN ATTEMPT </p><p>TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>14. DESPITE ITS LIMITED ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THE IPA MAY BE </p><p>ON THE VERGE OF AGREEING TO ADD FIFTY SEATS TO THE </p><p>CURRENT EIGHTY-MEMBER NATIONAL ASSEMBLY - FOR A TOTAL OF </p><p>130 SEATS, WITH A PORTION OF THOSE SEATS CONTESTED ON A </p><p>FIRST-PAST-THE-POST SYSTEM AND THE REMAINDER BY </p><p>PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION.  THIS OSTENSIBLE EFFORT AT </p><p>REPRESENTATIONAL INCLUSIVENESS APPARENTLY SERVES THE </p><p>INTERESTS OF OPPOSITION PARTIES MORE THAN IT DOES THE </p><p>RULING PARTY. HOWEVER, IF VOTING PATTERNS REMAIN </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH THE 1993 AND 1998 ELECTIONS, A NEW POLL </p><p>MAY YET RATIFY THE VOTERS\' PREFERENCE FOR THE LCD OVER </p><p>ALL OTHER PARTIES.  AFTER MUCH WRANGLING AND GOL </p><p>ACQUIESCENCE, THE IPA HAS ALSO AGREED TO REPLACE THE </p><p>CURRENT COMMISSIONERS OF THE INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL </p><p>COMMISSION (IEC). AFTER FAILING TO SADDLE THE LCD WITH </p><p>ACCUSATIONS OF ELECTORAL FRAUD, OPPOSITION POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES TURNED TO BLAME THEIR ELECTION DEFEAT ON THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE IEC, CLAIMING THAT HE WAS BRIBED. </p><p>(COMMENT: THIS WAS THE FIRST IEC IN THE ELECTION HISTORY </p><p>OF LESOTHO AND THE THREE COMMISSIONERS HAD NEVER HAD ANY </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING ELECTIONS.  THE THREE </p><p>COMMISSIONERS WERE THE NOMINEES OF OPPOSITION PARTIES AND </p><p>INITIALLY WERE DISTRUSTED BY THE LCD.  DESPITE THIS </p><p>HANDICAP, AND LIMITED TIME TO ACHIEVE THEIR MANDATE, THE </p><p>IEC WAS COMMENDED BY INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS REGIONAL </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVER GROUPS FOR THEIR JOB OF CONDUCTING THE </p><p>1998 ELECTIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, OPPOSITION MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>IPA SAY THEY HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE IEC, SO THEIR </p><p>SIX YEAR TERMS SHOULD BE TRUNCATED AND THEY SHOULD BE </p><p>REPLACED.  IN CONTRAST, ELECTION OBSERVERS CONCLUDED THAT </p><p>THE 1998 POLL MET INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC ELECTION THAT REFLECTED THE WILL OF THE </p><p>ELECTORATE.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>15. THE CURRENT IMPASSE WITHIN THE IPA IS CENTERED ON THE </p><p>PROPOSED MODEL FOR THE NEXT ELECTION.  THE RULING PARTY </p><p>PREFERS TO RETAIN THE TRADITIONAL ELECTORAL SYSTEM OF </p><p>FIRST PAST THE POST (FPTP) WHILE THE OPPOSITION PARTIES </p><p>SEE THEIR ADVANTAGE IN A MIXED SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL </p><p>REPRESENTATION (PR) AND A CONSTITUENCY BASED SYSTEM. </p><p>(COMMENT: THERE IS A CYNICAL VIEW AMONG SOME BASOTHO THAT </p><p>IT IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF ANY IPA MEMBERS TO SEE </p><p>ELECTION PREPARATION SUCCEED BECAUSE THE IPA HAS BECOME A </p><p>MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD FOR OPPOSITIONISTS, AND THE LCD IS </p><p>ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS GOVERNING AUTHORITY WITHOUT </p><p>INTERRUPTION OF ITS FIVE YEAR TENURE.
