<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 003099 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR ISA/ACHUA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSESSING NONG DUC MANH\'S LEADERSHIP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RAYMOND BURGHARDT, </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY.  NONG DUC MANH IS PERHAPS THE MOST </p><p>TELEGENIC VIETNAMESE LEADER SINCE HO CHI MINH.  DESPITE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03099  01 OF 03  310253Z </p><p>CONSTANT MEDIA EXPOSURE, LITTLE IS KNOWN OF HIS </p><p>PERSONAL VALUES OR ALLIES.  WESTERN PERCEPTIONS OF HIM </p><p>AS A POLITICAL REFORMER ARE LIKELY OFF THE MARK, AS </p><p>MANH MORE PROBABLY SHARES THE CONVICTIONS OF HIS PEERS </p><p>ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE CPV TO RETAIN EXCLUSIVE </p><p>POLITICAL POWER AND TO MOVE DECISIVELY TO COUNTER-ACT </p><p>WOULD-BE CHALLENGES TO "NATIONAL SOLIDARITY."  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PUBLIC PERSONA </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  SINCE HIS ELECTION AS GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) AT THE NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS IN APRIL 2001, NONG DUC MANH HAS RARELY BEEN </p><p>OUT OF THE PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT.  AS DE JURE LEADER OF THE </p><p>ALMOST 3-MILLION MEMBER CPV AND AS DE FACTO PARAMOUNT </p><p>LEADER (OF SORTS) OF THE NATION, MANH\'S PRESENCE IS </p><p>UBIQUITOUS.  RARELY DOES A DAY GO BY WITHOUT A PHOTO OF </p><p>HIM ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE CPV\'S "NHAN DAN" NEWSPAPER </p><p>OR WITHOUT COVERAGE OF HIM RECEIVING SOME HONORED GUEST </p><p>OR EXHORTING SOME CADRES ON NATIONAL NEWS.  WHETHER DUE </p><p>TO A SUNNY DISPOSITION OR A CAREFULLY CALCULATED SENSE </p><p>OF PUBLIC RELATIONS, MANH IS THAT RARE VIETNAMESE WHO </p><p>TURNS ON A SMILE FOR A CAMERA.  MOST OTHER VIETNAMESE </p><p>IN AND OUT OF LEADERSHIP RANKS SEEM TO FEEL OBLIGED TO </p><p>ADOPT A DIGNIFIED, SOLEMN DEMEANOR IN THE PRESENCE OF A </p><p>PHOTOGRAPHER.  HO CHI MINH WAS PROBABLY THE LAST </p><p>VIETNAMESE LEADER WHO WAS ROUTINELY SHOWN IN A BENIGN </p><p>AND EVEN HAPPY LIGHT IN THE OFFICIAL MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03099  01 OF 03  310253Z </p><p>4.  (C)  FOR ALL HIS PUBLIC PERSONA, HONED AS WELL </p><p>DURING ALMOST TEN YEARS AS NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN, </p><p>MANH THE MAN REMAINS A MYSTERY TO VIRTUALLY ALL FOREIGN </p><p>OBSERVERS, AND LIKELY TO MOST VIETNAMESE AS WELL. </p><p>UNLIKE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY COUNTERPARTS, HE DOES </p><p>NOT ROUTINELY MEET WITH FOREIGN DIGNITARIES VISITING </p><p>HANOI, UNLESS THEY ARE FRATERNAL PARTY DIGNITARIES IN </p><p>THEIR OWN RIGHT.  (HE DID, HOWEVER, RECEIVE SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL DURING THE JULY 2001 ASEAN MEETINGS.)  HIS </p><p>FOREIGN TRIPS AS GENERAL SECRETARY HAVE ALSO BEEN </p><p>CONSPICUOUSLY FEW: IN 2002, HE MADE ONLY TWO OVERSEAS </p><p>TRIPS, TO JAPAN AND TO RUSSIA AND BELARUS, BOTH WITHIN </p><p>THE SPACE OF A MONTH.  HIS ONLY KNOWN VISIT TO THE U.S. </p><p>WAS AS NA CHAIRMAN IN 2000.  AMBASSADOR HAS NOT MET </p><p>WITH MANH SINCE ARRIVAL AT POST IN DECEMBER 2001, </p><p>DESPITE A STANDING REQUEST DATING BACK FROM THE TIME OF </p><p>PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS IN FEBRUARY 2002.  INDEED, </p><p>WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CHINESE AND RUSSIAN </p><p>AMBASSADORS, WHO ESCORTED HIGH LEVEL VISITORS FROM </p><p>THEIR CAPITALS TO CALL ON MANH, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY </p><p>OTHER AMBASSADORS WHO HAVE MET HIM IN VIETNAM.  THE </p><p>JAPANESE AMBASSADOR MET MANH ONLY DURING MANH\'S VISIT </p><p>TO TOKYO EARLIER THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  JUDGING FROM PRESS ACCOUNTS, MANH MAINTAINS A </p><p>VIGOROUS IN-COUNTRY TRAVEL SCHEDULE, ESPECIALLY </p><p>TARGETING VIETNAM\'S POORER PROVINCES AND MOUNTAINOUS </p><p>AREAS DOMINATED BY ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS, LIKE HIS OWN </p><p>HOME PROVINCE OF BAC KAN.  ACCORDING TO BAC KAN </p><p>OFFICIALS, MANH RETURNS TO HIS HOMETOWN AT LEAST ONCE A </p><p>YEAR, AND IS SAID TO BE A CONVIVIAL IMBIBER OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03099  01 OF 03  310253Z </p><p>LOCAL POTENT LIQUOR.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HIS WIFE </p><p>REMAINS IN BAC KAN. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT DOES HE STAND FOR? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  FOR ALL HIS MEDIA EXPOSURE, MANH\'S OWN </p><p>POLITICAL CREDO OR INCLINATION TO SHAPE IDEOLOGY ARE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO DISCERN.  THE CPV UNDER HIS WATCH HAS MADE </p><p>A PUSH FOR STRENGTHENING "GRASS-ROOTS DEMOCRACY" AND </p><p>FOR REINFORCING POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION AT </p><p>ALL LEVELS OF SCHOOLING.  THESE APPEAR TO BE </p><p>COMPLEMENTARY EXERCISES NEITHER IN EXPANDING PUBLIC </p><p>PLURALISM NOR IN RETURNING TO MARXIST ROOTS, BUT RATHER </p><p>IN REASSERTING A STRONGER CPV ROLE AT A TIME OF </p><p>DRAMATIC DOMESTIC CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  MANH WON KUDOS FROM MANY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS FOR HIS APPARENT EFFORTS TO WAKE UP THE OFTEN </p><p>MORIBUND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DURING HIS TENURE THERE, </p><p>INCLUDING SUCH INNOVATIONS AS TELEVISION COVERAGE AND </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7110 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  03099  02 OF 03  310253Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    CIAE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------1E6C94  310253Z /38 </p><p>R 310206Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8498 </p><p>INFO ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 003099 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR ISA/ACHUA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/13 </p><p>SUBJ: ASSESSING NONG DUC MANH\'S LEADERSHIP </p><p> </p><p>FORMAL Q&A SESSIONS BETWEEN AT LEAST A SELECTED NUMBER </p><p>OF MINISTERS AND NA DELEGATES.  SOME FOREIGN ACADEMICS </p><p>DREW THE CONCLUSION THAT MANH WAS AT HEART A POLITICAL </p><p>REFORMER, AND, POSSIBLY, A CLOSET LIBERAL.  SUCH AN </p><p>INTERPRETATION DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN BORNE OUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03099  02 OF 03  310253Z </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY.  THE CPV UNDER MANH (AS BEFORE) HAS </p><p>ORCHESTRATED PLENUMS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE EACH OF THE </p><p>PLENARY NA SESSIONS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF, AND </p><p>COMMENTED PUBLICLY AND SPECIFICALLY ON WHAT THE NA </p><p>SHOULD TRY AND SHOULD NOT TRY TO ACCOMPLISH DURING </p><p>THOSE SESSIONS.  AS SUCH, MANH HAS AT LEAST INDIRECTLY </p><p>UNDERCUT THE GROWING PUBLIC LEGITIMACY AND AUTHORITY </p><p>THE NA HAD BEGUN TO ACHIEVE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  FURTHER, UNDER MANH\'S LEADERSHIP, THE GVN AND </p><p>CPV HAVE MOVED AGGRESSIVELY AGAINST SOME PERCEIVED </p><p>THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND NATIONAL UNITY, </p><p>INCLUDING FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY, NEW AND OFTEN YOUNG </p><p>"CYBER-DISSIDENTS," AND WOULD-BE MONTAGNARD ACTIVISTS. </p><p>THESE ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS GO AGAINST THE BROADER </p><p>TREND OF GROWING PERSONAL FREEDOMS WITHIN VIETNAM THAT </p><p>HAVE EMERGED OVER THE PAST DECADE.  THERE ARE NO REAL </p><p>INDICATIONS OF ANY IMMINENT PERIOD OF POLITICAL </p><p>LIBERALIZATION OR GREATER EASE ABOUT ACCEPTING PUBLIC </p><p>AND PRIVATE CRITICISM OF THE PARTY AND COMMUNIST SYSTEM </p><p>SYSTEM UNDER MANH\'S RULE.  TWO MORE PROMINENT ACTIVISTS </p><p>WERE DETAINED SHORTLY AFTER CHRISTMAS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  MANH HAS ACKNOWLEDGED OFTEN AND FORCEFULLY THE </p><p>NEED FOR THE CPV TO CLEAN UP ITS OWN ACT AND MOVE </p><p>QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ITS MIDST. </p><p>THE UPCOMING "NAM CAM" MAFIA CASE IS APT TO BE THE </p><p>SHOWCASE EFFORT IN THIS REGARD, ALTHOUGH MOST OF ITS </p><p>OFFICIAL VICTIMS HELD GVN -- RATHER THAN CPV -- POSTS. </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND INFORMATION ON DECEMBER 19 </p><p>FORMALLY CRITICIZED THE MEDIA (IN PARTICULAR TUOI TRE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03099  02 OF 03  310253Z </p><p>"YOUTH" AND GIA DINH VA XA HOI "FAMILY AND SOCIETY") </p><p>FOR REPORTING "IRRESPONSIBLY" AND "INACCURATELY" THAT </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS EVEN ABOVE THE DEPUTY MINISTER-LEVEL </p><p>WOULD BE IMPLICATED IN THIS CASE. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL ALLIES? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  UNFORTUNATELY, EMBASSY HAS NO INSIGHT INTO </p><p>THE ALLIANCES WITHIN THE CPV LEADERSHIP MANH HAS </p><p>FORGED, OR INTO THE DYNAMICS OF DECISION-MAKING AT THAT </p><p>LEVEL.  HIS TECHNOCRATIC BACKGROUND AND STUDIES </p><p>OVERSEAS LEFT HIM PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE </p><p>MILITARY/PUBLIC SECURITY LOOP, AND OUR ASSUMPTION IS </p><p>THAT THESE LINKS ARE NOT HIS MAJOR STRENGTHS, DESPITE </p><p>HIS CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE CPV\'S MILITARY COMMISSION.  NOR </p><p>ARE THERE OBVIOUS CONNECTIONS WITH THE ONCE ALL- </p><p>POWERFUL PROPAGANDA AND IDEOLOGICAL ORGANS OF THE CPV; </p><p>WE DO NOT EXPECT SCHOOLCHILDREN TO START READING NONG </p><p>DUC MANH\'S COLLECTED WORKS, OR TO SEE ANY MANH-PRODUCED </p><p>VERSION OF JIANG ZEMIN\'S "THREE REPRESENTS" ENTER THE </p><p>THE CPV PANTHEON ANY TIME SOON.  THE ORGANIZATIONAL/ </p><p>PERSONNEL WING OF THE CPV APPARENTLY REMAINS UNDER THE </p><p>DOMINATION OF NA CHAIRMAN NGUYEN VAN AN, WHO MANY </p><p>ASSUME MAY STILL BE A REAL OR POTENTIAL RIVAL AFTER </p><p>HAVING LOST THE GENERAL SECRETARY SWEEPSTAKES TO MANH </p><p>AT THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>GOING OUT ON A LIMB </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03099  02 OF 03  310253Z </p><p>11.  (C) WAS MANH\'S ELEVATION TO THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP </p><p>SLOT MERELY A MATTER OF NICE GUYS -- OR AT LEAST </p><p>SOMEONE WITHOUT ANY KNOWN CORRUPT TINGES IN HIS FAMILY </p><p>TREE -- FINISHING FIRST?  WAS IT DYNASTIC DEFERENCE TO </p><p>HIS ALLEGED DESCENT FROM HO CHI MINH?  IS HE AN </p><p>UNLIKELY PUPPET OF FORMER "SENIOR ADVISER" DU MUOI OR </p><p>PENULTIMATE CPV LEADER LE KHA PHIEU (BOTH OF WHOM WERE </p><p>DUTIFULLY TROTTED OUT AT THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF THE </p><p>LATEST NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SESSIONS IN ANOTHER GESTURE OF </p><p>SOLIDARITY)?  OR IS HE JUST THAT LOWEST COMMON </p><p>DENOMINATOR CANDIDATE WHO COULD BE COUNTED ON NOT TO </p><p>ROCK THE SHIP OF STATE AT A DELICATE HISTORICAL </p><p>JUNCTION? </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  WE DON\'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THE ABOVE </p><p>QUESTIONS; NOR, WE SUSPECT, DOES VIRTUALLY ANYONE IN </p><p>VIETNAM TODAY.  WE ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THERE </p><p>IS A LOT MORE TO MANH THAN MEETS THE EYE, BUT THAT HE </p><p>NEEDS TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY GIVEN A POLITBURO AND </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE PROBABLY NOT OF HIS OWN DESIGN OR </p><p>SHAPING.
