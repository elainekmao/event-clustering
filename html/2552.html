THE ONLY CREDIBLE PUBLISHED POLL BY </p><p>THE MASS PUBLIC OPINION POLL FROM A JANUARY STRATIFIED </p><p>SAMPLE SURVEY SHOWED MDC WITH A TWO TO ONE MARGIN AMONG </p><p>VOTERS EXPRESSING A PREFERENCE, WITH ALMOST 60 PER CENT </p><p>DECLINING TO REVEAL THEIR INTENTIONS.  WE UNDERSTAND </p><p>THAT A PRIVATE GOVERNMENT POLL ALSO SHOWED PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE TRAILING BY A NARROWER MARGIN OF THE LOW 50 PER </p><p>CENT TO HIGH 40 PER CENT RANGE. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, ZANU-PF INSIDERS ARE </p><p>PRIVATELY EXPRESSING GREATER CONFIDENCE IN RECENT WEEKS </p><p>OVER THE LIKELY ELECTION OUTCOME AND THEIR PROSPECTS OF </p><p>MAINTAINING POWER.  PART OF THIS CONFIDENCE COMES FROM </p><p>WHAT THEY FEEL HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL MOBILIZATION OF THEIR </p><p>RURAL VOTER BASE AND SUBSTANTIAL INTIMIDATION OF </p><p>POTENTIAL MDC VOTERS IN RURAL AREAS AND OTHER AREAS </p><p>WHERE MDC SUPPORT IS NOT OVERWHELMING.  THERE ARE ALSO </p><p>CREDIBLE REPORTS OF VOTE MANIPULATION, PARTICULARLY WITH </p><p>MILITARY BALLOTS, LAST-MINUTE ADDITIONS TO THE VOTER </p><p>ROLLS ONLY IN AREAS OF ZANU-PF STRENGTH AND IN THE MOST </p><p>RURAL VOTING PRECINCTS AND WITH MOBILE POLLING STATIONS. </p><p>IN ADDITION, THE MDC HAS BEEN FRUSTRATED IN ITS CAMPAIGN </p><p>BY POLICE OR ZANU-PF MOB PREVENTION OF SCORES OF </p><p>OPPOSITION RALLIES.  MOREOVER, EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO </p><p>HOLD DOWN THE TURNOUT IN AREAS OF MDC STRENGTH -- URBAN </p><p>AREAS AND MATABELELAND THROUGH DELAY IN ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>POLLING PLACES AND REDUCTION OF POLLING STATIONS IN </p><p>URBAN AREAS.  ITS MUCH HYPED UNVEILING OF THE ALLEGED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00574  070037Z </p><p>ASSASSINATION PLOT BY MDC CANDIDATE TSVANGIRAI ALSO </p><p>PLEASES ZANU-PF.  WHILE WE DOUBT THAT THE CONSPIRACY </p><p>ACCOUNT HAS CHANGED MANY VOTES, IT HAS RAISED  FEARS </p><p>AMONG SOME MDC SUPPORTERS THAT, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO COME TO POWER, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THEREBY DISCOURAGING MDC SUPPORTERS FROM VOTING. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AS REPORTED IN REFTEL, MDC\'S CHANCES IMPROVE, </p><p>DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE TURNOUT.  GIVEN THE EXTENT </p><p>OF ZANU-PF VOTE MANIPULATION, LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON </p><p>OPPOSITION CAMPAIGNING AND USE OF THE STATE RADIO AND </p><p>TELEVISION, AND CONTINUING TARGETED  INTIMIDATION AND </p><p>VIOLENCE, A VERY HIGH VOTER TURNOUT IS EVEN MORE </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR THE OPPOSITION TO OVERCOME THE ABOVE </p><p>HANDICAPS.  FOR THE MDC TO PREVAIL, IT COULD TAKE 80 PER </p><p>CENT OR MORE TURNOUT, A PARTICIPATION RATE THAT WAS </p><p>ANTICIPATED IN THE JANUARY OPINION POLL, BUT WHICH COULD </p><p>DIMINISH DUE TO OBSTACLES PLACED IN THE WAY OF </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN MDC AREAS OF STRENGTH.  EVEN WITH A </p><p>VERY HIGH TURNOUT, AN MDC MARGIN OF VICTORY WOULD LIKELY </p><p>BE FAIRLY NARROW, GIVEN THE COUNTERVAILING FACTORS AT </p><p>PLAY.  ALTERNATIVELY WITH A LOWER TURNOUT, ZANU-PF COULD </p><p>WELL PREVAIL DUE TO THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ITS </p><p>STRENGTH IN RURAL AREAS, INTIMIDATION OF OPPOSITION </p><p>ACTIVITY AND VOTE MANIPULATION.  WE DO NOT THINK IT </p><p>LIKELY THAT ZANU-PF CAN WIN BY A LARGE MARGIN.  THERE IS </p><p>SUFFICIENT SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION AND ARE SUFFICIENT </p><p>CHECKS IN THE VOTING AND COUNTING SYSTEM TO PREVENT </p><p>WHOLESALE MANIPULATION OF THE COUNT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ANOTHER REASON FOR GREATER ZANU-PF CONFIDENCE IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00574  070037Z </p><p>INCREASED PLANNING FOR HOW THEY CAN PREVENT TSVANGIRAI </p><p>FROM TAKING OFFICE, EVEN IF HE SHOULD WIN THE VOTE. </p><p>MANIPULATION OF THE ALLEGED ASSASSINATION PLOT INTO A </p><p>FORMAL CHARGE OF TREASON IS ONE OBVIOUS ROUTE, BUT WE </p><p>KNOW THEY ARE THINKING OF OTHER MEANS AS WELL TO SUBVERT </p><p>A NEGATIVE RESULT.  WHETHER THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO </p><p>EXECUTE SUCH PLANS WOULD DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, </p><p>INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL REACTION TO THE RESULTS AND THE </p><p>WILLINGNESS OF THE ARMED FORCES TO SUPPORT ACTION TO </p><p>SUBVERT AN ELECTION RESULT IN FAVOR OF THE MDC. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
