<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001724 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PM, NEA, WHA, WHA/PPC, WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, MARR, PREL, PGOV, SP, PL, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: STATUS OF HONDURAN TROOP DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. TEGUCIGALPA 1243 </p><p>     B. TEGUCIGALPA 1309 </p><p>     C. JUNE 15 INFO MEMO FROM DR. S. ZAKHEIM TO </p><p>        SECRECTARY OF DEFENSE </p><p>     D. STATE 207638(ALL NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry L. Palmer for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) SUMMARY:  Training continues for the all volunteer </p><p>Task Force Xatruch (TFX), the 370 soldier contingent Honduras </p><p>plans to deploy to Iraq by mid-August.  The task force is </p><p>composed of 35 officers and 335 enlisted soldiers. TFX will </p><p>deploy as part of the Spanish Brigade in the Polish Division </p><p>and will operate in the vicinity of An Najaf.  TFX will work </p><p>side-by-side with local police to patrol this major smuggling </p><p>zone.  This area has been pacified and the biggest expected </p><p>threat TFX might face will be organized crime elements.  Task </p><p>Force officers informed PolMilOff that the unit\'s training </p><p>was nearing completion and moral was high.  Equipment and </p><p>sustainment needs continue to be a major concern, that could </p><p>delay the deployment of the Task Force.  Also, due to the </p><p>fact that TFX will deploy through Kuwait, a Status of Forces </p><p>Agreement (SOFA) with the Government of Kuwait must be </p><p>completed before GOH forces enter the theater of operations. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Task Force Xatruch </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Training continues for TFX, the 370 soldier contingent </p><p>Honduras plans to deploy to Iraq mid-August.  The task force, </p><p>composed of 35 officers and 335 enlisted soldiers, is </p><p>comprised of volunteers from throughout the Honduran Armed </p><p>Forces (HOAF).  TFX will deploy (with the other Central </p><p>American forces) as part of the Spanish Brigade under the </p><p>Polish Division and will operate in the vicinity of An Najaf. </p><p> TFX will work side-by-side with local police to patrol this </p><p>major smuggling zone.  This area has been pacified and the </p><p>biggest expected threat TFX might face will be organized </p><p>crime elements.  The breakdown of TFX is: </p><p> </p><p>1 Command and Control Unit with 13 Officers and 7 Enlisted; </p><p>1 Infantry Company with 5 Officers and 101 Enlisted; </p><p>1 Infantry Company with 5 Officers and 100 Enlisted; </p><p>1 Military Police Company with 5 Officers and 77 Enlisted; </p><p>1 Support Company with 7 Officers and 40 Enlisted. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) TFX is commanded by COL Carlos Andino Cobos who </p><p>recently returned from a survey trip to the deployment zone </p><p>in Iraq.  COL Andino reports that his biggest concern is the </p><p>morale of his troops after arriving in Iraq.  Apparently, the </p><p>deployment zone near An Najaf does not offer any type of </p><p>diversion when units are off duty.  (Comment:  The Honduran </p><p>contingency will be deploying without any means to provide </p><p>rest and recreational activities for its troops; alcohol is </p><p>also not permitted.  Also, a senior military officer </p><p>expressed his concerns that the HOAF has not developed a </p><p>mechanism for TFX soldiers to have even periodic telephone </p><p>contact with their families back home during the deployment. </p><p>The Hondurans will be quartered in housing vacated by </p><p>departing U.S. Marine units with practically no conveniences </p><p>left behind.  Boredom will surely be a problem and COL Andino </p><p>fears that none of his soldiers will volunteer to stay past </p><p>the planned six month deployment due to the significant </p><p>hardships they will face.  End Comment) </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The HOAF reports that of the 35 officers slated to </p><p>deploy to Iraq, over half have served as part of the UN </p><p>peacekeeping mission to the Sinai.  Also, for the first time, </p><p>Honduras will deploy six women as part of its contribution to </p><p>the international peacekeeping effort.  The primary mission </p><p>of these women will be to function as interlocutors with the </p><p>women of Iraq, thus respecting local customs. The planned </p><p>deployment of TFX will be for six months.  HOAF officials </p><p>have indicated a second volunteer task force will be readied </p><p>to replace TFX at the end of the six month deployment. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On July 7 PolMilOff visited Honduran military base </p><p>at Tamara to review the progress of TFX.  Base commanders and </p><p>TFX officers all reported good progress and high moral, </p><p>although one officer noted that the young age of many of the </p><p>enlisted soldiers could potentially be problematic due to </p><p>their inexperience.  Nine members of Joint Task Force Bravo </p><p>(JTF-B) were also present as observers to verify that TFX </p><p>members are able to complete the 33 assigned principal tasks </p><p>(and the many subsets below them) necessary before the </p><p>deployment can go forward.  JTF-B personnel reported good </p><p>progress by the Honduran troops toward these goals. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) While the training of TFX is proceeding on schedule, </p><p>sustainment and equipment needs continue to be a challenge. </p><p>TFX members still do not know exactly how they will deploy to </p><p>Iraq or how their other logistical needs will be met.  Prior </p><p>to any deployment, the GOH must also complete a SOFA </p><p>agreement with the Government of Kuwait (ref D).  The GOH is </p><p>working hard toward the completion of a SOFA in order to have </p><p>the agreement in place before the end of July.  The current </p><p>target date for the arrival of TFX to Iraq is sometime in </p><p>mid-August with the stand-up of the force projected for </p><p>September 1. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Vetting of TFX </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Post understands the necessity to vet TFX members </p><p>for human rights abuses due to the fact that the unit will be </p><p>receiving USG funding.  This process is moving forward and </p><p>should be completed soon.  In the interim, the HOAF assured </p><p>Post verbally that none of the members of TFX participated in </p><p>the incident at the El Porvenir prison where 68 people were </p><p>killed, many purportedly at the hands of GOH security forces </p><p>(ref B). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Political Environment </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Honduras, under the leadership of President Maduro, </p><p>was an early member of the Coalition of the Willing, and </p><p>remains a supporter of the U.S. position on Iraq.  The HOAF </p><p>is also interested in increasing its participation in </p><p>international peacekeeping missions, although at this point </p><p>without significant USG assistance this is not a foreseeable </p><p>option.  While the deployment of TFX to Iraq has not </p><p>generated much public debate, apart from the usual </p><p>denunciations of the Bloque Popular (a coalition of leftist </p><p>activists), if TFX were to sustain even minimal casualties, </p><p>public opinion could turn rapidly against Honduran </p><p>participation in the reconstruction of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) On July 16 the National Innovation and Unity Party </p><p>(PINU), a minor opposition party in the national congress, </p><p>announced it is planning to introduce a resolution to block </p><p>the planned troop deployment due to concerns about the </p><p>security situation in Iraq.  PINU members also pointed to the </p><p>fact that U.S. forces have yet to discover any weapons of </p><p>mass destruction, which they charge undermines the legitimacy </p><p>of U.S. forces in Iraq.  However, their main fear remains the </p><p>risk of Honduran casualties.  This effort, which has little </p><p>chance of success, is politically inspired to further place </p><p>responsibility for the troop deployment squarely on Maduro\'s </p><p>Nationalist Party. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment:  The GOH is hoping for generous USG military </p><p>assistance for its participation as a member of the Coalition </p><p>of the Willing, one of the first countries to sign and ratify </p><p>an Article 98 agreement, and as a nation willing to send its </p><p>troops to Iraq.  HOAF officials are well aware that some of </p><p>their neighbors receive FMF assistance and are looking for </p><p>similar funding based on Honduras\' overall support of the USG </p><p>foreign policy objectives.  A high ranking GOH official </p><p>privately questioned Honduras\' knee-jerk support of U.S. </p><p>international objectives, and if U.S. military assistance </p><p>does not materialize, the critics may grow louder and wider </p><p>among GOH officials. End Comment </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
