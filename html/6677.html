(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  AMBASSADOR DELIVERED REFTEL DEMARCHE ON </p><p>THE AFTERNOON OF 3/23 TO MFA MINSTATE SHAYKH </p><p>HAMDAN BIN ZAYID (OTHER TOPICS SEPTEL, NOTAL). </p><p>SHAYKH HAMDAN REPEATED WHAT HE HAS TOLD US BEFORE </p><p>-- NAMELY, THAT THE UAEG IS RELUCTANT TO CLOSE </p><p>IRAQ\'S DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS HERE BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>"GREAT VALUE" BEING DERIVED FROM THE UAE MISSION </p><p>IN BAGHDAD.  DESIROUS OF AVOIDING A TIT-FOR-TAT </p><p>CLOSURE, THE UAEG HAS MADE CLEAR TO THE IRAQI </p><p>DIPLOMATS HERE THAT THEY ARE TO BEHAVE THEMSELVES. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR NOTED IN PARTICULAR THE NEED TO </p><p>KEEP TABS ON IRAQI INTELLIGENCE SERVICE </p><p>OPERATIVES.  SHAYKH HAMDAN REASSURED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT SURVEILLANCE OF THE OFFICIAL </p><p>IRAQIS IS CONSTANT AND INTRUSIVELY OBVIOUS.  HE </p><p>BELIEVED THEY HAD GOTTEN THE MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  SHAYKH HAMDAN NOTED THAT HE GETS CALLS </p><p>3-4 TIMES PER DAY FROM THE UAE CHARGE IN BAGHDAD </p><p>(USING A THURAYYA SATELLITE TELEPHONE).  THE </p><p>EMIRATI MISSION IS ABLE TO GLEAN USEFUL </p><p>INFORMATION FROM ITS CONTACTS ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>INSIDE IRAQ (INDEED, DURING THE MEETING THE </p><p>EMIRATI CHARGE IN BAGHDAD CALLED SHAYKH HAMDAN TO </p><p>REPORT ON 20 EXPLOSIONS IN WESTERN BAGHDAD AROUND </p><p>THE TAJI MILITARY COMPLEX AND A NUMBER OF OTHER </p><p>SITES).  AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE INFORMATION THE UAEG </p><p>IS ABLE TO OBTAIN, THE MFA MINSTATE CONFIDED THAT </p><p>IRAQI SOURCES HAVE TOLD THE EMIRATIS IN BAGHDAD </p><p>THAT ALI HASSAN AL-MAJID (AKA "CHEMICAL ALI) IS </p><p>DEAD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  COMMENT:  THE UAE CLEARLY BELIEVES </p><p>THAT THE THREAT POSED BY ALLOWING IRAQI MISSIONS </p><p>TO REMAIN OPEN HERE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY MITIGATED </p><p>BY AGGRESSIVE SURVEILLANCE, STRICT WARNINGS TO </p><p>IRAQI DIPLOMATS, AND THE COOPTION OF KEY PERSONNEL </p><p>(MOST NOTABLY THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR).  WE WOULD </p><p>NOTE THAT ORCA CHIEF HERE IS OF A SIMILAR VIEW. </p><p>GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE THE UAEG ATTACHES TO KEEPING </p><p>TABS ON DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ, AND THE RELATIVELY </p><p>EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF CONTACTS WHICH THE UAEG </p><p>ENJOYS IN BAGHDAD AND BEYOND, WE DO NOT BELIEVE </p><p>THE UAEG IS LIKELY TO CHANGE ITS VIEW THAT CLOSING </p><p>IRAQ\'S DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS HERE IS NOT IN THE </p><p>INTEREST OF THE EMIRATES. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
