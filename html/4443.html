<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006812 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ECA/A/S/A; NEA/PPD; NEA/ARN, IIP/G/NEA, R </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: JO, KPAO, SCUL, OEXC, OIIP </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS DELIVER MESSAGE TO </p><p>RECEPTIVE BUT HESITANT AUDIENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE ECA FUNDED U.S. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS </p><p>TOUR VISITED JORDAN OCTOBER 20-22 TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE TO </p><p>JORDANIAN STUDENTS THAT THEY CONTINUE TO BE WELCOME IN U.S. </p><p>UNIVERSITIES.  THE PROGRAM INCLUDED DIALOGUE AND INFORMATION </p><p>SESSIONS FOR HIGH-LEVEL EDUCATION CONTACTS, UNIVERSITY AND </p><p>HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ADMINISTRATORS, AND THE GENERAL </p><p>PUBLIC, INCLUDING A BREAKFAST DISCUSSION WITH SENIOR </p><p>UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS HOSTED BY AMBASSADOR GNEHM.  ALL </p><p>AUDIENCES, INCLUDING PROSPECTIVE JORDANIAN STUDENTS AND </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES, WERE GENERALLY RECEPTIVE AND EAGER TO HEAR </p><p>THE MESSAGE, BUT DID NOT HIDE THEIR CONTINUED HESITANCY </p><p>ABOUT THE PERCEIVED SITUATION, REGARDING TOLERANCE, COMFORT- </p><p>LEVEL, AND NEW VISA, ENTRY, AND REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS, </p><p>IN THE U.S. FOR ARAB AND MUSLIM STUDENTS.  THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATORS\' PROGRAM ATTRACTED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE MEDIA </p><p>COVERAGE, WITH MOST REPORTS FOCUSING ON THE ADMINISTRATORS\' </p><p>MESSAGE OF WELCOME AND ON PACIFYING VISA RELATED </p><p>MISCONCEPTIONS.  POST ARRANGED CONSULAR REPRESENTATION AT </p><p>ALL PUBLIC FUNCTIONS AND FOUND THEIR PARTICIPATION TO BE </p><p>ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO ADDRESS NEVER-ENDING VISA-RELATED </p><p>QUESTIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   PAS AND AMIDEAST TEAMED UP TO COORDINATE THE U.S. </p><p>UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS TOUR OCTOBER 20-22 IN JORDAN.  THE </p><p>THREE U.S. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS SELECTED FOR JORDAN, </p><p>CHARLES GREENLEAF, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, RANDALL </p><p>RICHARDSON, UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, AND MARY GRAY, AMERICAN </p><p>UNIVERSITY, WERE EFFECTIVE IN DELIVERING A CLEAR AND </p><p>CONSISTENT MESSAGE OF WELCOME TO JORDANIAN STUDENTS, AND </p><p>AUDIENCES SEEMED TO RECEIVE THE REPRESENTATIVES AS </p><p>AUTHORITATIVE, GENUINE, AND SYMPATHETIC.  PROGRAM EVENTS </p><p>INCLUDED A BREAKFAST PANEL DISCUSSION HOSTED BY THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR WITH UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS, ADMINISTRATORS AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM SPONSORS, A PRESS ROUNDTABLE WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL MAJOR LOCAL PRINT AND RADIO MEDIA, </p><p>A PUBLIC INFORMATION SESSION THAT DREW A CROWD OF AROUND 300 </p><p>PEOPLE, AND MEETINGS AND INFORMATION SESSIONS AT A LOCAL </p><p>UNIVERSITY AND A HIGH SCHOOL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  TWO MAIN CONCERNS BECAME CLEAR FROM ALL SESSIONS, WITH </p><p>ONE OR THE OTHER WEIGHING MORE HEAVILY DEPENDING ON THE </p><p>SPECIFIC AUDIENCE.  THE FIRST ISSUE CONCERNED THE TREATMENT </p><p>OF ARAB AND MUSLIM STUDENTS IN THE U.S., BOTH SOCIALLY </p><p>WITHIN UNIVERSITY AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES, AND </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVELY BY GOVERNMENT OR UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS.  THE </p><p>SECOND ISSUE CENTERED ON NEW VISA, ENTRY AND REGISTRATION </p><p>PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS.  WHILE ALL GROUPS EXPRESSED AT </p><p>LEAST SOME AMOUNT OF APPREHENSION REGARDING BOTH ISSUES, </p><p>GENERALLY ATTENDEES WITH LITTLE PREVIOUS EXPOSURE TO THE </p><p>U.S. EXPRESSED MORE ANXIETY OVER TREATMENT CONCERNS, WHILE </p><p>THOSE WITH EXTENSIVE PERSONAL OR FAMILY EXPERIENCE IN THE </p><p>U.S. CITED NEW PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS AS THEIR LARGEST </p><p>WORRY.  AT AN INFORMATION SESSION HELD FOR THE GENERAL </p><p>PUBLIC, THE ADMINISTRATORS AND PANEL MEMBERS RESPONDED TO </p><p>MANY QUESTIONS ALONG THE LINE OF "WILL I BE REJECTED </p><p>ADMISSION OR EVALUATED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE I AM ARAB?" </p><p>COMPARATIVELY, AT A PANEL DISCUSSION HELD FOR APPROXIMATELY </p><p>50 STUDENTS AND PARENTS AT THE PRESTIGIOUS AMMAN </p><p>BACCALAUREATE SCHOOL, A HIGH SCHOOL THAT REGULARLY SENDS ITS </p><p>STUDENTS TO U.S. UNIVERSITIES SUCH AS HARVARD AND BROWN, THE </p><p>MAJORITY OF QUESTIONS WERE POSED BY PARENTS AND DIRECTED AT </p><p>THE EMBASSY\'S CONSULAR OFFICER.  THIS AUDIENCE, WHILE </p><p>MAINTAINING A VERY FAVORABLE VIEW OF U.S. HIGHER EDUCATION </p><p>AND A PREFERENCE FOR SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO THE U.S. TO </p><p>STUDY, MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER </p><p>OTHER OPTIONS IF THEY FELT THAT THEIR CHILDREN WOULD FACE </p><p>DIFFICULT LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES RELATED TO </p><p>THEIR ENTRY AND RESIDENCE IN THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE ADMINISTRATORS\' TOUR RECEIVED EXTENSIVE LOCAL MEDIA </p><p>COVERAGE, WITH THE MAJORITY OF HEADLINES REFLECTING THE </p><p>MESSAGES OF WELCOME AND/OR THE CONTINUED ISSUANCE OF STUDENT </p><p>VISAS.  AL-RA\'I ARABIC DAILY CARRIED TWO INSIDE-PAGE </p><p>REPORTS, ONE WITH THE HEADLINE: "U.S. AMBASSADOR: WE WELCOME </p><p>JORDANIAN AND ARAB STUDENTS IN OUR UNIVERSITIES," AND THE </p><p>SECOND HEADLINE: "AMERICAN ACADEMICS: NUMBER OF JORDANIAN </p><p>STUDENTS IN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES DID NOT GO DOWN AFTER </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11."  IN ADDITION, AL-DUSTOUR ARABIC DAILY FILED </p><p>AN ARTICLE WITH POSITIVE REMARKS BY THE ADMINISTRATORS </p><p>REGARDING THE SITUATION OF ARAB STUDENTS IN AMERICAN </p><p>UNIVERSITIES, AND THE JORDAN TIMES ENGLISH DAILY CARRIED A </p><p>REPORT FOCUSING ON ATTEMPTS TO "ALLAY CONCERNS OVER THE </p><p>TREATMENT OF ARAB STUDENTS IN THE U.S. AND DISPEL ANY VISA </p><p>DELAY RUMORS."  WHILE NO REPORTS WERE ENTIRELY NEGATIVE, AN </p><p>ARTICLE FILED BY THE LOCAL AP REPORTER INCLUDED THE </p><p>HEADLINE: "U.S. UNIVERSITY ENVOYS REASSURE ARAB STUDENTS </p><p>THEY ARE WELCOME, BUT JORDANIANS REMAIN SUSPICIOUS."  THIS </p><p>SAME REPORT QUOTED FROM INTERVIEWS WITH JORDANIAN STUDENTS </p><p>ATTENDING THE PUBLIC INFORMATION SESSION, INCLUDING ONE 18- </p><p>YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO STATED, "DESPITE THE ASSURANCES WE\'RE </p><p>HEARING, I\'M STILL AFRAID BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBLE HARASSMENT </p><p>I MAY FACE AS AN ARAB.  MY PARENTS ARE OPPOSED TO SENDING ME </p><p>TO THE UNITED STATES AND PREFER THAT I GO TO ENGLAND." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  THE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS\' EXPLICIT </p><p>WELCOME TO ARAB AND MUSLIM STUDENTS IS, FINALLY, ONE MESSAGE </p><p>THAT JORDANIANS WANT TO HEAR.  THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE PROGRAM </p><p>SESSIONS REFLECTED A SENSE THAT JORDANIANS TRULY WANT TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THEY OR THEIR CHILDREN ARE WELCOME AND SAFE IN </p><p>U.S. UNIVERSITIES, DESPITE THEIR REMAINING HESITATION.  THE </p><p>TWO TYPES OF AUDIENCES ENCOUNTERED DURING THIS TOUR POINTS </p><p>TO TWO NEEDED STRATEGIES:  FIRST, SINCE IT IS A MESSAGE THAT </p><p>THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ALREADY DESIRE TO BE TRUE, IT IS </p><p>HELPFUL TO REPEATEDLY STATE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS THE SIMPLE </p><p>MESSAGE THAT ARAB AND MUSLIMS ARE WELCOME AND DESIRED AT </p><p>U.S. UNIVERSITIES.  IN ADDITION, FOR OUR MORE EXPOSED </p><p>AUDIENCE, IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE INCREASED ACCESS </p><p>TO CLEAR, DEFINITIVE INFORMATION ON VISA, ENTRY, AND </p><p>REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
