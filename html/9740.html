<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001817 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, MARR, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM, MARITIME SECURITY </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: AMBASSADOR\'S JULY 8 TRIP TO ADEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 1700 </p><p> </p><p>     B. SANAA 1699 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Begin summary:  The Ambassador\'s July 8 trip to the </p><p>southern port city of Aden (reftels) to attend the graduation </p><p>ceremony of the first group of Yemeni officials trained by </p><p>the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) received favorable coverage in </p><p>both national and local press.  During the visit, the </p><p>Ambassador also met with the newly appointed Governor of </p><p>Aden, Dr. Yahya Al-Shaibi, to discuss the training, </p><p>strengthening Aden\'s security posture and an </p><p>Internet-in-the-classroom initiative (ref b).  Two Aden-based </p><p>independent newspapers -- the widely-circulated daily </p><p>Al-Ayyam, and the weekly Al-Tariq -- carried extensive </p><p>coverage of the visit underscoring the vital role of Yemeni </p><p>coastal forces in safeguarding the port of Aden and the </p><p>Yemeni coastline.  Al-Ayyam also published exclusive </p><p>interviews with Ambassador Hull (text para 5) and USCG </p><p>Representative to Yemen, Captain Robert Innes (text para 6). </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  On July 9, Al-Ayyam, an independent daily based in </p><p>Aden, published a full-page, illustrated story titled </p><p>"American Ambassador Praises First Graduates of the Yemen </p><p>Coast Guard and Affirms They Will Be A Deterring Force to </p><p>Protect Yemen,s Security."  The article described the </p><p>graduation of about 20 Yemeni officers as the "first (Yemen) </p><p>coastal force trained by experts from the U.S. Coast Guard," </p><p>and said the Deputy Governor of Aden, Abdul-Karim Shaif, </p><p>praised the efforts of the American experts.  The paper also </p><p>mentioned the Ambassador,s discussions with the newly </p><p>appointed Governor of Aden, Dr. Al-Shaibi (ref b). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  On July 10, Al-Ayyam published an exclusive </p><p>full-page interview under the heading "U.S. Ambassador to the </p><p>Paper: Yemen Exerted Serious Efforts to Increase Security for </p><p>Aden Port and Yemeni Coasts"  (text para 5).  The interview </p><p>discussed various aspects of U.S.-ROYG cooperation, as well </p><p>as reconstruction in Iraq and the Roadmap. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Aden-based weekly Al-Tariq carried a half-page </p><p>report titled "Aimed at Protection and Safeguard of Shipping </p><p>at the Regional Waters the Americans Sponsor Training of </p><p>First Group of Yemen Coast Guard Forces" on July 15.  The </p><p>report says that following the attacks on the USS Cole at the </p><p>Port of Aden and the French tanker along the coast of </p><p>Mukalla, there has been an urgent need for the existence of a </p><p>security apparatus to undertake the responsibility of </p><p>ensuring safety and security for Yemen territorial waters. </p><p>Al-Tariq concludes that this will require the establishment </p><p>of a Yemen Coast Guard. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Excerpt from Ambassador\'s Interview with Aden-based </p><p>daily Al-Ayyam. </p><p> </p><p>(Begin text) </p><p> </p><p>Al-Ayyam:  Could you brief us on the reason for your visit to </p><p>Aden? </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador:  We have three reasons for this visit.  First, is </p><p>to meet with the new Governor of Aden who has a good </p><p>reputation.  Since we are interested in doing a number of </p><p>things in Aden, it would be good to get to know the Governor </p><p>at the beginning of his new post and also to know his ideas </p><p>and explore the issues of co-operation.  The second reason </p><p>for the visit is to announce a new program launched by the </p><p>Embassy, which is the e-learning program under the Middle </p><p>Eastern partnership initiative.  We have $ 1.5 million to get </p><p>Internet into 20 to 25 Yemeni schools.  We will choose five </p><p>schools in Aden and five in Sana,a.  The rest will be </p><p>distributed to other Yemeni governorates.  We wanted to </p><p>inform the Governor about this project and get his support. </p><p>The third reason is that the U.S. Coast Guard has a team in </p><p>Aden providing training for the Yemen Coast Guard.  Today we </p><p>are attending the graduation of the first batch of </p><p>U.S.-trained Yemen Coast Guard officers and I wanted to be </p><p>here for the graduation. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Ayyam:  Your government has a lot of programs for Yemen, </p><p>some of which are in Aden, such as the de-mining program and </p><p>the current security training for Aden Airport security.  Why </p><p>don,t you have a consulate here as rumors indicate that you </p><p>have an intention to open one? </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador:  I think the answer to that is simple that we </p><p>feel that we could do all our works in Aden by visiting Aden </p><p>regularly from Sana,a.  Transportation between Sana,a and </p><p>Aden including air flights are available and the roads are </p><p>good.  This allows us to do several programs though we do not </p><p>have permanent representation here. </p><p>Al-Ayyam:  How do you think Coast Guard training would serve </p><p>Aden Port security and how would that be reflected in the </p><p>West? </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador:  I think the world is watching Yemen make serious </p><p>efforts to increase security in Aden port and along the </p><p>Yemeni coasts as a whole.  This is not the issue of high </p><p>sounding statements, but these are doable efforts and do not </p><p>only include getting the required equipment but also getting </p><p>the necessary training to enable the Coast Guard force to use </p><p>such equipment effectively.  In addition, the Coast Guard is </p><p>building a qualified modern institution with the required </p><p>infrastructure such as the headquarters and maintenance </p><p>centers to be able to run their operations.  Therefore you </p><p>have to look at what the Coast Guard is doing and not at what </p><p>is being said about them.  If you looked at what Yemenis are </p><p>doing to improve security in Aden and along the Yemen coast, </p><p>I think that will have a great effect to change the image </p><p>that there is no security in this area. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Ayyam:  In regards to e-learning, how many schools will </p><p>have the program?  Will the private sector take part in this </p><p>program? </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador:  The program includes 20 schools at least in </p><p>Yemen and we hope that the private sector will participate. </p><p>We are currently in contact with the private sector and we </p><p>have found some interest.  We believe that it is natural for </p><p>the private sector to contribute to this program since </p><p>Internet training in Yemen for a new generation capable of </p><p>using the Internet would be very useful for private </p><p>establishments. </p><p> </p><p>(End text) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  On July 9, Al-Ayyam carried an article based on a </p><p>July 8 interview with USCG Representative Captain Robert </p><p>Innes. </p><p> </p><p>(Begin text) </p><p> </p><p>"U.S. Maritime Officer to Al-Ayyam:  Aden is Nominated to </p><p>Establish a Regional Coast Guard Training Center" </p><p> </p><p>In his talk to al-Ayyam, Captain Robert Innes, Maritime </p><p>Advisor to the Yemeni Authorities, described the graduation </p><p>of the first batch of the Yemen Coast Guard as a step in a </p><p>series of others to train the Yemen Coast Guard.  He </p><p>indicated that "the training of the first batch focuses on </p><p>safety and security and future training will include maritime </p><p>and engineering skills for all, since achieving </p><p>professionalism in this area means training to all sailors." </p><p> </p><p>As far as the new training programs are concerned, he said </p><p>that "new training programs actually began before this one, </p><p>which ended today (July 8th); even started, and will </p><p>continue."  "We have been working with the Yemen Navy for two </p><p>years and my job is to transfer knowledge and experience and </p><p>infrastructure equipment to the leadership, and once this </p><p>leadership takes over they would be able to do everything by </p><p>themselves" he added. </p><p> </p><p>Responding to al-Ayyam,s question about having a regional </p><p>training center instead of moving from a port to another and </p><p>whether Aden is nominated for this; Mr. Innes said that there </p><p>will be one in the future and that Aden is nominated "but we </p><p>are looking for an institution for which Aden could act as a </p><p>branch.  The center in Aden will be leading a 500km-long </p><p>coast with operation centers alongside the coast.  Other </p><p>ports such as Mukalla and Hodeida will have branches too. </p><p>There is a great benefit in making certain duties such as </p><p>training central since this is an economic issue too. The </p><p>Yemen Navy and the Yemen Coast Guard have been clever about </p><p>this since they have selected the best examples from all over </p><p>the world and not from the United States alone and I am </p><p>encouraging them to do this.  The system followed in the U.S. </p><p>may not be the best for Yemen.  America is a big country and </p><p>applying the American system in Yemen may not be the best </p><p>solution, and the Yemen Government has looked around the </p><p>world for the models that suit them best." </p><p> </p><p>(End text) </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
