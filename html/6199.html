<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HELSINKI 000262 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, CH, FI, Finland-Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES IRAQ WITH PRESIDENT HALONEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: HELSINKI 248 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL CHIEF JOHN HALL, REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON MARCH 4 THE AMBASSADOR CALLED ON PRESIDENT HALONEN </p><p>FOR A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF ISSUES ON THE INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>BILATERAL AGENDA.  IRAQ WAS THE CHIEF TOPIC.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>BEGAN BY THANKING THE PRESIDENT FOR HER RECENT FIRM PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESOLVING THE CRISIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HELSIN  00262  071504Z </p><p>LIES WITH SADDAM, NOT WITH THE UN, THE U.S., OR OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE PRESIDENT REITERATED HER BELIEF THAT IRAQI </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS IS THE KEY TO THE PROBLEM. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, SHE STRESSED THAT THE MAJORITY OF FINNS </p><p>OPPOSE DISARMING SADDAM BY FORCE.  AN ANTI-WAR PETITION </p><p>SIGNED BY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD BEEN DELIVERED TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL PALACE DURING THE DAY-LONG DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>FEBRUARY 15.  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED FINLAND ON BEING A </p><p>COUNTRY THAT WELCOMES DISSENT -- AND CONGRATULATED THE FINNS </p><p>ON THEIR ABILITY TO DISSENT IN AN ORDERLY WAY.  THE PRESIDENT </p><p>LAUGHED, "YES, WE FINNS ARE ORDERLY." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) HALONEN ALSO VOICED FINNISH CONCERN ABOUT THE </p><p>AFTERMATH OF A CONFLICT, ESPECIALLY ITS EFFECT ON THE </p><p>DEVELOPING NATIONS OF THE REGION.  IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REACH OUT TO NATIONS WHERE POVERTY IS </p><p>RAMPANT -- WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE CONNECTIONS.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE </p><p>POLITICAL STRUCTURES OF NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, EMPHASIZING </p><p>THAT SHE WAS NOT WORRIED ABOUT IRAN.  (SHE SEEMED TO BE </p><p>REFERRING IN PARTICULAR TO SAUDI ARABIA.)  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>SAID THE UNITED STATES IS EQUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ECONOMIC </p><p>AND POLITICAL STABILITY, BOTH WITHIN IRAQ AND IN THE REGION, </p><p>AND WAS COMMITTED TO A VISION OF A FUTURE OF HOPE FOR ALL OF </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST.  IN THIS CONNECTION, WE APPRECIATE FINLAND\'S </p><p>PUBLICLY-STATED WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>IN IRAQ, WITH HUMANITARIAN AID AND PEACEKEEPERS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHETHER THE AMBASSADOR THOUGHT A </p><p>CONFLICT WAS INEVITABLE.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HELSIN  00262  071504Z </p><p>OBSERVED THAT DIPLOMATS OFTEN ANSWER A QUESTION WITH A </p><p>QUESTION.  FOLLOWING THAT MODEL, SHE ASKED WHETHER THE </p><p>PRESIDENT THOUGHT SADDAM HAD ANY INTENTION OF FULLY </p><p>DISARMING.  IT SEEMS HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF: IF HE DID </p><p>NOT HONOR THE FIRST UNSC RESOLUTION ON IRAQ, WHAT IS THE </p><p>CHANCE THAT HE WILL HONOR THE EIGHTEENTH? </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE PRESIDENT AND THE AMBASSADOR ALSO BRIEFLY </p><p>DISCUSSED HALONEN\'S BUSY SCHEDULE OF INTERNATIONAL VISITS </p><p>OVER THE PAST YEAR.  PRESIDENT HALONEN SAID AGAIN HOW MUCH </p><p>SHE APPRECIATED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MEETING WITH HER LAST APRIL, </p><p>AND THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HELPING ARRANGE THE VISIT, </p><p>ALONG WITH CALLS ON JUSTICE O\'CONNOR AND SENATOR HELMS.  IT </p><p>IS CLEAR HALONEN IS ALSO STILL THINKING ABOUT HER VISIT TO </p><p>CHINA LAST NOVEMBER.  SHE SAID THAT FOR MANY NATIONS THE </p><p>FUTURE LIES IN WORKING WITH CHINA.  STILL THERE REMAINS MUCH </p><p>FOR THE CHINESE TO DO IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS FIELD.  SHE NOTED </p><p>THAT SHE HAD BEEN CRITICIZED FOR NOT TAKING A STRONGER STANCE </p><p>ON THIS ISSUE DURING HER VISIT.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE SAME </p><p>APPLIES TO IRAQ -- WHO HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE?  WHERE IS THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OUTRAGE OVER THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY SADDAM AGAINST HIS </p><p>OWN PEOPLE? </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: WE ARE STRUCK BY HOW MUCH MORE MODERATE </p><p>PRESIDENT HALONEN\'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS ARE TODAY THAN EVEN TWO </p><p>YEARS AGO.  ALTHOUGH FINLAND REMAINS A NON-ALIGNED NATION -- </p><p>AND MANY FINNS REMAIN OUTRIGHT PACIFISTS -- HALONEN HAS MADE </p><p>CLEAR IN A HIGH-PROFILE WAY HER VIEW THAT THE HEAT MUST BE </p><p>KEPT ON SADDAM.  IN DECEMBER SHE AND PM LIPPONEN TOGETHER </p><p>APPROVED FINLAND\'S PUBLIC COMMITMENT TO AIDING IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HELSIN  00262  071504Z </p><p>POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ, AT A TIME WHEN NOT THAT </p><p>MANY NATIONS HAD COME FORWARD WITH SUCH A COMMITMENT.  TO </p><p>SOME EXTENT, SHE IS PROBABLY TRYING TO CLOSE RANKS WITH </p><p>LIPPONEN, SINCE ELECTIONS ARE  IMMINENT (MARCH 16).  AND </p><p>LIPPONEN HAS INDEED MADE USE OF HER STATEMENTS, ANSWERING </p><p>OPPOSITION CRITICISM OF FINLAND\'S IRAQ STANCE BY SAYING HIS </p><p>GOVERNMEN IS IN LINE WITH THE PRESIDENT\'S POLICY (REFTEL). </p><p>MCELVEEN-HUNTER </p><p></p></div>
