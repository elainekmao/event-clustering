(SBU)  Summary:  Mehmet Erbas, a junior </p><p>faculty member at Mersin University, has </p><p>conducted scholarly research about the migration </p><p>of Kurds from the countryside to the cities of </p><p>Turkey.  He believes that "Kurdish identity" will </p><p>survive transplantation to the metropolis as long </p><p>as Kurdish migrants see a benefit to it.  The </p><p>Turkish State has no ability to influence this </p><p>process.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Mehmet Erbas, a young assistant </p><p>professor of sociology at Mersin University\'s </p><p>Science and Literature Faculty, has carved out a </p><p>niche in the study of a very significant </p><p>phenomenon of contemporary Turkey: the massive </p><p>migration by rural Kurds to urban areas.  This </p><p>migration has dramatically changed the </p><p>demographics of cities like Mersin, as well as </p><p>other cities in the southeast, and indeed </p><p>throughout the country.  Istanbul, by some </p><p>reckonings, is now the largest Kurdish city in </p><p>the world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Erbas is not Kurdish.  He hails from </p><p>Ordu, on the Black Sea.  He does not speak </p><p>Kurdish.  Nevertheless, he has undertaken the </p><p>study of Kurdish migration because he feels it is </p><p>a crucially important topic for understanding </p><p>where Turkey is headed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  In a wide-ranging April 11 discussion </p><p>in his office at Mersin University, Erbas offered </p><p>some perhaps unconventional thoughts about the </p><p>nature, and consequences, of large-scale rural- </p><p>to-urban migration by southeastern Kurds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  First, "it\'s not about language." </p><p>According to Erbas, the ability to speak Kurdish </p><p>is not crucial to Kurdish identity in Turkey. </p><p>There are politicized Kurds who do not know the </p><p>language.  He cited the case of the large Kurdish </p><p>diaspora from Turkey that now resides in Western </p><p>Europe.  These Kurds, he said, have made no </p><p>attempt to set up Kurdish language schools for </p><p>their children.  This stands in contrast to </p><p>Turkish emigrants in Western Europe, who have </p><p>done so.  At the same time, he noted, Kurds </p><p>living in Western Europe who came from northern </p><p>Iraq did work to set up Kurdish-language </p><p>education for their children - in effect, </p><p>replicating the Kurdish-language educational </p><p>system they had back in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Second, "it\'s not clear how much of </p><p>the tenacity of the culture is its Kurdishness </p><p>and how much is its ruralness."  This observation </p><p>would likely be agreed upon by many residents of </p><p>Turkey\'s cities who have been urbanized longer, </p><p>and who have noted, often with dismay, the </p><p>persistence of rural folkways (in dress, in </p><p>ritual, in family stucture) in the city.  A </p><p>family slaughtering its Kurban Bayram sheep on a </p><p>fifteenth-floor balcony of a high-rise in an </p><p>apartment complex is as likely to be Turkish as </p><p>Kurdish. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Third, there is class-consciousness </p><p>among Kurds, but it has a twist.  There is a </p><p>large number of well-off, even wealthy, Kurds in </p><p>a city like Mersin.  Those who buy a summer beach </p><p>house do not go out of their way to make sure </p><p>they will have Kurdish neighbors there.  On the </p><p>other hand, if one goes to a typical Newroz </p><p>(Nevruz, the Persian-Kurdish March 21 celebration </p><p>of Spring) celebration in a large Turkish city, </p><p>the crowd is likely to be made up of middle and </p><p>lower-class Kurds.  Wealthy Kurds do not usually </p><p>attend.  Why?  Interestingly, according to Erbas, </p><p>it is not out of snobbery.  Rather, it is out of </p><p>fear that being seen at such events by Turkish </p><p>authorities might open them to accusations of </p><p>being overly "politicized" in their Kurdishness. </p><p>(Note:  Some contacts recall for us that in the </p><p>1980s and 1990s there were wealthy and powerful </p><p>Kurds who disappeared mysteriously.  End note.) </p><p>A prosperous and successful Kurd in Turkey still </p><p>might worry about the risks of "guilt by </p><p>association" with more radical elements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Fourth, the basic motivation for </p><p>maintaining one\'s Kurdish identity after the move </p><p>from the country to the city is, in Erbas\' view, </p><p>"to get something from it."  The "something" he </p><p>has in mind is not an ineffable kind of ethnic </p><p>pride.  Rather, it is something pragmatic in re </p><p>housing and jobs.  Uniquely among citizens of </p><p>Turkey, the Kurds of the southeast over their </p><p>history developed an elaborate system of "clan" </p><p>or "tribe" ("asiret" in Turkish) affiliation. </p><p>This system is part and parcel of the phenomenon </p><p>of the "aga" (large feudal landowner) system - </p><p>also peculiar to Kurdish lands in southeast </p><p>Turkey.  The salience of the clan system </p><p>persists.  Polling done among Kurdish youth in </p><p>the southeast, for example, is ambiguous; </p><p>depending on how one looks at it, young people\'s </p><p>belief in the value of the clan system is either </p><p>(predictably) fading or (remarkably) still alive. </p><p>(Note: It was in angry reaction to the </p><p>"feudalism" of the clan and "aga" system that a </p><p>young Kurd named Abdullah Ocalan first embraced </p><p>revolutionary politics as a Marxist at Ankara </p><p>University in the 1970s.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  As it effects rural-to-urban </p><p>migration, the relevance of enduring clan values </p><p>among southeastern Turkey\'s Kurds is that a </p><p>typical Kurdish rural-to-urban migrant is not, </p><p>and cannot be, "an individual actor."  While a </p><p>random rural Turkish family from, say, Erzurum </p><p>might be drawn to a neighborhood in Istanbul or </p><p>Ankara that offers hometown contacts, there are </p><p>many other neighborhoods to choose from.  The </p><p>tighter bonds of clan connection in the Kurdish </p><p>world dictate differently.  Clan is expected to </p><p>seek out and be helped by clan.  To fly in the </p><p>face of that practice, according to Erbas, means </p><p>that an incoming migrant simply might not be </p><p>cold-shouldered.  Concretely, that might mean not </p><p>being offered informal assistance with job- </p><p>seeking or not being invited to settle in a </p><p>neighborhood, particularly a squatter </p><p>("gecekondu" in Turkish) neighborhood.  Thus, </p><p>maintaining one\'s "Kurdishness" is a practical </p><p>necessity for access to housing and employment </p><p>and social acceptance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Comment:  As long as new migrants </p><p>remain dependent on personal, family, and clan </p><p>networks to survive, Kurdish ethnic identity is </p><p>likely to survive in contemporary urban Turkey, </p><p>no matter what actions Turkish State authorities </p><p>take.  End comment. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
