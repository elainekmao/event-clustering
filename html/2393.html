REASON: 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C)  SUMMARY: THE MFA\'S DIRECTOR FOR EU INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>AND JUDICIAL AFFAIRS, GIUSEPPE BUCCINO, REITERATED TO POLOFF </p><p>THAT THERE WILL BE NO/NO MAJOR CHANGES IN ITALY\'S EUROPEAN </p><p>POLICY.  PM BERLUSCONI SEES NO CONTRADICTION IN PROTECTING </p><p>AND ADVANCING BOTH NATIONAL AND COMMON EUROPEAN INTERESTS. </p><p>THE GOI IS DEVOTING CONSIDERABLE TIME AND EFFORT, AT THE VERY </p><p>HIGHEST LEVELS, TO SECURING ITS PLACE IN EUROPE.  STILL, </p><p>BUCCINO SHARED THE VIEW OF MANY INSIDE THE MFA THAT FORMER FM </p><p>RUGGIERO\'S RESIGNATION REPRESENTED A "WASTED CHANCE" FOR </p><p>IMPROVING THE STATUS OF ITALY IN EUROPE.  PM BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>DECISION TO TAKE THE HELM OF THE MFA ON AN INTERIM BASIS </p><p>ALLOWS A COOLING OFF PERIOD, AND MEANS RUGGIERO\'S SUCCESSOR </p><p>WOULD MEET LESS RESISTANCE FROM WITHIN THE MFA FOR THE PLAN </p><p>TO FOCUS RESOURCES ON COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  PM BERLUSCONI HAS SAID THAT A WELL-CRAFTED EUROPEAN </p><p>CONSTITUTION IS NECESSARY TO THE FUTURE OF A VIBRANT EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMUNITY.  THE GOI WANTS A CONSTITUTION THAT INCLUDES A </p><p>CHARTER OF RIGHTS, AND MORE CLEARLY DEFINES THE ROLES AND </p><p>COMPETENCIES OF COMPONENT INSTITUTIONS.  THE CONVENTION WILL </p><p>ALSO HAVE TO DEAL CAREFULLY WITH THE CONCEPT OF SUBSIDIARITY, </p><p>AND THE GOI WILL SUPPORT GIVING AN ENHANCED ROLE TO NATIONAL </p><p>PARLIAMENTS IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES IN BRUSSELS. </p><p>THE ITALIAN DELEGATION TO THE CONVENTION WILL CONSIST OF ONE </p><p>DELEGATE OF GOVERNMENT (ACCORDING TO BUCCINO, THIS MAY BE AN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00274  01 OF 03  171552Z </p><p>ACADEMIC), PLUS TWO REPRESENTATIVES FROM PARLIAMENT, ONE FROM </p><p>THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, ONE FROM THE SENATE.  ITALY WOULD </p><p>PREFER THAT THE SUBSEQUENT INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE </p><p>(IGC) FINISH ITS WORK BY THE END OF 2003.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ON JANUARY 15, THE MFA\'S DIRECTOR FOR EU </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL AND JUDICIAL AFFAIRS, GIUSEPPE BUCCINO, </p><p>REITERATED TO POLOFF THE VIEW INSIDE THE MFA (REPORTED REF B) </p><p>THAT FORMER FM RUGGIERO\'S RESIGNATION REPRESENTED A "WASTED </p><p>CHANCE" FOR IMPROVING THE STATUS OF ITALY IN EUROPE AND THE </p><p>MFA WITHIN THE GOI.  BUCCINO CONFIDED THAT HE WAS A GREAT </p><p>SUPPORTER OF RUGGIERO\'S, AND LOOKED TO HIM AS SOMETHING OF A </p><p>ROLE MODEL.  RUGGIERO HAD A LONG CAREER IN DIPLOMACY, A </p><p>STERLING REPUTATION AMONG OTHER EURO-DIPLOMATS, AND WAS A </p><p>FELLOW NEAPOLITAN TO BOOT. BUT BUCCINO HAD OBSERVED THE </p><p>PUBLIC ARGUMENT BETWEEN ECONOMIC MINISTER TREMONTI AND </p><p>RUGGIERO DURING THE LAEKEN EU SUMMIT, WHICH OCCURRED IN FRONT </p><p>OF PM BERLUSCONI.  BUCCINO COULD SENSE FROM THE LOOK ON </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S FACE THAT HIS HERO\'S DAYS IN GOVERNMENT WERE </p><p>NUMBERED.  (COMMENT: AS REPORTED REF B, CHEERLEADERS FOR </p><p>RUGGIERO SUCH AS BUCCINO WERE CLEARLY IN THE MINORITY AT THE </p><p>MFA.  GIVEN RUGGIERO\'S STRENGTH OF CHARACTER AND SELF ESTEEM, </p><p>PERHAPS HE COULD NOT HAVE SUBMERSED HIMSELF ENOUGH FOR LONG </p><p>ON ANY TEAM; WITNESS HIS SIX WEEKS AS CEO AT ENI.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ACCORDING TO BUCCINO, BERLUSCONI\'S DECISION TO TAKE </p><p>THE HELM OF THE MFA ON AN INTERIM BASIS WAS CORRECT.  IT </p><p>ALLOWS A COOLING OFF PERIOD FOR EMOTIONS TO CALM AFTER </p><p>RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE.  BUCCINO ALSO APPROVES OF BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>PLAN TO HAVE EMBASSIES AND AMBASSADORS FOCUS MORE ENERGY ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00274  01 OF 03  171552Z </p><p>PROMOTING ITALIAN COMMERCIAL INTERESTS WORLDWIDE, BUT THAT </p><p>OPINION WAS NOT SHARED BY MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES.  HE </p><p>SURMISED THAT RUGGIERO\'S SUCCESSOR WOULD MEET LESS RESISTANCE </p><p>FROM WITHIN THE MFA IF THE PLAN WERE SEEN AS A CONTINUATION </p><p>OF BERLUSCONI\'S POLICY RATHER THAN AS A NEW INITIATIVE OF </p><p>HIS/HER OWN.  (NOTE:  THERE IS CONSIDERABLE INTERNAL GOI </p><p>DEBATE, DESPITE THE REBUTTAL OF MINISTER OF PRODUCTION </p><p>ACTIVITIES ANTONIO MARZANO, OVER MOVING ICE (INSTITUTO </p><p>COMMERCIO ESTERO, EQUIVALENT TO OUR FOREIGN COMMERCIAL </p><p>SERVICE) TO THE MFA.  GIVEN MARZANO\'S OWN FIRM ROLE IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN HIS AREA OF EXPERTISE, WE ANTICIPATE THIS MOVE </p><p>IS UNLIKELY.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  TURNING TO THE FOREIGN POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF </p><p>RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE, BUCCINO SAID THAT HE HAD PARTICIPATED </p><p>PERSONALLY IN A NUMBER OF MEETINGS WITH BERLUSCONI, AND HE </p><p>ASSURED POLOFF THAT THERE WILL BE NO/NO MAJOR CHANGES IN </p><p>ITALY\'S EUROPEAN POLICY.  POLITICIANS, INDUSTRY LEADERS, AND </p><p>ACADEMICS ALL AGREE THAT ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY HAS TWO FOCAL </p><p>POINTS; ITS ROLE IN A STRONG EUROPEAN UNION, AND ITS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES.  ANYTHING THAT WOULD </p><p>DETRACT FROM THAT PREMISE IS INCONCEIVABLE.  BERLUSCONI SEES </p><p>NO CONTRADICTION IN PROTECTING AND ADVANCING BOTH NATIONAL </p><p>AND COMMON EUROPEAN INTERESTS.

BUCCINO INSISTED THAT THE GOI\'S VIEW HAS BEEN, AND </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO BE, THAT WHAT "BUILDS UP EUROPE, BUILDS UP </p><p>ITALY." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) BUCCINO NOTED THAT 2002 WILL BE A CRITICAL YEAR IN </p><p>THE HISTORY OF THE EU, AND WILL SET THE COURSE FOR THE FUTURE </p><p>OF THE INSTITUTION.  THIS YEAR\'S CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION </p><p>WILL REQUIRE "REASONING, DEBATE, AND DEEPER KNOWLEDGE" OF THE </p><p>ISSUES AMONG MEMBER STATES, BUT THE FINAL OUTCOME WILL BE A </p><p>STRONGER, MORE DEMOCRATIC EU.  THE CONVENTION PROCESS ITSELF </p><p>REPRESENTS A MORE TRANSPARENT, DEMOCRATIC APPROACH THAN HAS </p><p>BEEN USED IN THE PAST FOR DRAFTING EU TREATIES.  PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI HAS SAID ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, PUBLICLY AND IN </p><p>CLOSED MEETINGS, THAT A WELL CRAFTED EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION </p><p>WOULD BE NECESSARY TO THE FUTURE OF A VIBRANT EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMUNITY.  CONVENTION MEMBERS MUST AVOID CREATING A DOCUMENT </p><p>THAT CONFUSES THE AVERAGE EUROPEAN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  BUCCINO SAID THAT THE GOI WANTS A CONSTITUTION THAT </p><p>INCLUDES A CHARTER OF RIGHTS, AND MORE CLEARLY DEFINES THE </p><p>ROLES AND COMPETENCIES OF COMPONENT INSTITUTIONS.  BUT </p><p>FLEXIBILITY WAS ALSO ESSENTIAL. ITALY DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE </p><p>GERMAN GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A </p><p>COMPLETE "CATALOG" DELINEATING EU/STATE/REGIONAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES.  CERTAIN ISSUES WILL REQUIRE CREATIVE </p><p>THINKING ON HOW CENTRAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES CAN WORK </p><p>TOGETHER. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00274  02 OF 03  171553Z </p><p>8.  (C)  THE CONVENTION WILL HAVE TO DEAL CAREFULLY WITH THE </p><p>CONCEPT OF SUBSIDIARITY.  FORMER PM GIULIANO AMATO - ONE OF </p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENTS OF THE CONVENTION - HAS STATED PUBLICLY </p><p>THAT IN SOME AREAS THE EU WILL BE REQUIRED TO DO MUCH MORE - </p><p>DEFENSE, ENVIRONMENT, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH -  BUT THAT IN MORE </p><p>"TRADITIONAL" MATTERS, LIKE AGRICULTURE AND STRUCTURAL </p><p>IMPROVEMENT FUNDS, THE "FIRST PILLAR" MECHANISMS MAY BE TOO </p><p>STRONG AND MIGHT HAVE TO BE REINED IN AND MADE TO ABIDE BY </p><p>MORE DEMOCRATIC RULES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  BUCCINO SAID THE GOI WILL SUPPORT AN ENHANCED ROLE </p><p>FOR NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES IN </p><p>BRUSSELS.  ONE WAY MAY BE TO ESTABLISH MORE FORMALIZED LINES </p><p>OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN AND NATIONAL </p><p>PARLIAMENTS. THE GOI\'S VIEW IS THAT NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS </p><p>SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPEAL IMMEDIATELY ANY </p><p>REGULATION BELIEVED TO VIOLATE THE CONCEPT OF SUBSIDIARITY TO </p><p>THE COURT OF JUSTICE.  UNDER CURRENT PROCEDURES, SUCH APPEALS </p><p>CAN ONLY BE FILED AFTER A REGULATION IS ENFORCED.  BUCCINO </p><p>SAID THAT THE GOI\'S SUPPORT FOR MORE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION BY </p><p>NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE PROPOSAL BY SOME </p><p>EP MEMBERS TO ESTABLISH A "SECOND CHAMBER" OF THE EP, WHICH </p><p>WOULD BE COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS.  THE </p><p>GOI\'S VIEW IS THAT SUCH A CHAMBER WOULD REDUCE THE LEGITIMACY </p><p>OF AND "RE-NATIONALIZE" THE EP. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  IN ADDITION TO AMATO, THE ITALIAN DELEGATION TO THE </p><p>CONVENTION WILL CONSIST OF ONE DELEGATE OF GOVERNMENT, </p><p>(ACCORDING TO BUCCINO, THIS MAY BE AN ACADEMIC) PLUS TWO </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM PARLIAMENT, ONE FROM THE CHAMBER OF </p><p>DEPUTIES AND ONE FROM THE SENATE, AND WILL MOST LIKELY BE ONE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00274  02 OF 03  171553Z </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY MEMBER AND ONE GOVERNMENT PARTY MEMBER.  THE </p><p>FINAL DECISION WILL BE MADE BY THE END OF JANUARY.  TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED BY DIPLOMATS FROM MEMBER STATES </p><p>(BUCCINO WILL LIKELY BE ONE OF THE DIPLOMATS). </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  THE CONVENTION WILL WORK FOR ONE YEAR (MARCH </p><p>2002-MARCH 2003).  SUBSEQUENT FORMAL ADOPTION OF THE </p><p>CONVENTION\'S RECOMMENDATIONS BY AN INTER-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>CONFERENCE (IGC) WILL BE SUBJECT TO MEMBER STATES\' INTERNAL </p><p>POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS.  ACCORDING TO BUCCINO, THE BRITISH </p><p>WANT A SLOW PROCESS (CONCLUSION OF THE IGC AT THE END OF </p><p>2004) SO AS NOT TO HURT CHANCES FOR PASSAGE OF THE EURO </p><p>REFERENDUM IN THE UK IN 2003.  ITALY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE </p><p>IGC FINISH BY THE END OF 2003, GIVEN THAT EP ELECTIONS AND A </p><p>DECISION ON ACCESSION OF NEW MEMBERS ARE SCHEDULED FOR 2004. </p><p>(COMMENT: NOT COINCIDENTALLY, THIS WOULD BE A FEATHER IN </p><p>ITALY\'S CAP FOR ITS OWN PRESIDENCY, WHICH ENDS IN DECEMBER </p><p>2003.) </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  COMMENT:  THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS GENERAL </p><p>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS OF THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT DESIGNED </p><p>TO REASSURE SKEPTICS THAT ITALY REMAINS FIRMLY ANCHORED IN </p><p>EUROPE.  THE DETAIL OF BUCCINO\'S READOUT ON THE SPECIFICS OF </p><p>GOI THINKING ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE STRONGLY REINFORCES </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0878 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00274  03 OF 03  171553Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  OPR-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------59492C  171553Z /38 </p><p>O 171539Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1721 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 000274 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/17/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EU, IT, PGOV, PINR, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA VIEW ON FOREIGN POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF </p><p>RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE AND THE GOI\'S ROLE IN EU REFORM AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00274  03 OF 03  171553Z </p><p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p>THOSE STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS OUR CONVICTION THAT ITALY </p><p>REMAINS STRONGLY COMMITTED TO ITS VIEW OF A STRONGER EUROPEAN </p><p>UNION.
