<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001177 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, MARCH 30: WAR IN IRAQ; ARAB </p><p>OPPOSITION TO WAR </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: Media commentary reflects a sense of alienation </p><p>and resentment vis-a-vis Kuwait\'s Arab League confreres. </p><p>Demonstrations were held this week in front of the Libyan </p><p>and Syrian embassies in Kuwait, and a proposal now before </p><p>the National Assembly calls for parliamentary approval of </p><p>any financial aid to Arab countries. </p><p> </p><p>Commentators opine that Iraqis are not rebelling against </p><p>Saddam\'s regime because they remember their experience in </p><p>1991, when the US "encouraged and then deserted them." On </p><p>the news pages, five Iraqi infiltrators, believed to be </p><p>Fedayeen Saddam militia members, were apprehended at the </p><p>Kuwaiti border on March 28. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  News Stories: The lead story in all newspapers on March </p><p>30 is coverage of a missile that exploded after midnight in </p><p>the sea near a popular Kuwait City waterfront mall, injuring </p><p>two. The air raid sirens did not sound, as the missile </p><p>reportedly came in under radar level. </p><p> </p><p>Five suspected Fedayeen Saddam were apprehended after </p><p>crossing into Kuwait on March 28, reports Al-Seyassa. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas front pages a report that approximately 85 percent </p><p>of high school students came to school on March 29, the </p><p>first day of classes since schools were closed one week ago </p><p>due to the outbreak of hostilities. </p><p> </p><p>National Assembly Speaker Jassem Al-Khrafi described the pro- </p><p>Iraqi demonstrations in some Arab countries as "controlled </p><p>and not staged voluntarily", Al-Qabas reports on its front </p><p>page. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas also reports that MP Khaled Al-Adwa has urged the </p><p>National Assembly to adopt a resolution requiring National </p><p>Assembly approval of any financial assistance from the </p><p>Kuwait Arab Fund to protest the Arab stance towards Saddam\'s </p><p>regime. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports that the American Embassy in Kuwait </p><p>has received hundreds of phone calls this week supporting </p><p>the war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Around 2000 Kuwaitis demonstrated on March 25 in front of </p><p>several Arab embassies. The protestors chanted slogans </p><p>against Saddam\'s regime, Arab satellite channels that </p><p>"support" the regime and Syrian and Libyan support of </p><p>Saddam, Al-Rai Al-Aam reports. </p><p> </p><p>Kuwaiti students returning from Jordan tell Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>that they were abused and their cars vandalized. Al-Qabas </p><p>reports that Kuwaiti students in Bahrain have also faced </p><p>abuse and plans are being made to assist their return to </p><p>Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reports that three hotels in </p><p>Kuwait City received bomb threats on March 28, all hoaxes. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports that on March 30, 1.5 million liters </p><p>of drinking water from Kuwait will arrive in Umm Qasr. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "No Gloating" </p><p>Conservative Salah Al-Fadli wrote in independent Al-Rai Al- </p><p>Aam (3/26):  "The American war on Iraq does not have any </p><p>kind of legal or moral legitimacy. The only good thing that </p><p>will come out of this war is getting rid of Saddam. It is </p><p>shameful and regrettable that some simple-minded people, in </p><p>the face of global American hegemony, gloat at Iraq now. </p><p>Instead of gloating, we should be wary for the future of </p><p>this region and for the fate of our communities in the face </p><p>of future [American] plans for the area." </p><p> </p><p>4. "Coordination with the Iraqi Opposition" </p><p>Shiite MP Abdul-Mohsen Yousef Jamal wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Qabas (3/26): "Some wonder why people in southern Iraq, are </p><p>not rising up against the [Iraqi] regime as they did in </p><p>1991. Perhaps they fear a repeat performance by Saddam\'s </p><p>regime, when after former President Bush first encouraged </p><p>and then deserted them, they became easy prey. Currently, </p><p>they are probably waiting. to see if America\'s claim of </p><p>changing the Iraqi regime is credible. Another reason is </p><p>that the Americans to date have refused to coordinate with </p><p>the Iraqi opposition. American coordination with the Iraqi </p><p>opposition is crucial, and the quicker the better since </p><p>condemnation of the war is on everyone\'s lips." </p><p> </p><p>5. "A Salute to the Coalition Forces" </p><p>Liberal Ibrahim Al-Duaij wrote in independent Al-Seyassah </p><p>(3/29): "Al-Arabia satellite channel has become the new </p><p>mouthpiece for the leader of the Iraqi regime. They have </p><p>begun broadcasting pictures of children, women and old men </p><p>stained with blood and claiming that they are the victims of </p><p>the American strike on Iraq. Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabia will </p><p>not succeed in defending the regime in Baghdad, no matter </p><p>how hard they try." </p><p> </p><p>6. "Kuwait\'s Interests First" </p><p>Liberal Dr. Naji Al-Zaid wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(3/29): "We offered [Syria] 1,109 million dollars as aid, </p><p>without interest. This money was given so that Syrian </p><p>citizens could live in comfort. This applies also to Lebanon </p><p>and other Arab countries. Unfortunately. they still insist </p><p>on keeping Saddam and his regime in power. Our interests are </p><p>no longer with any country that does not support our right </p><p>to exist. Our interests lie with those who can guarantee us </p><p>our freedom, sovereignty and democracy." </p><p> </p><p>7. "Kuwait\'s Aid and the Arab Demonstrations" </p><p>Mohammad Al-Ajmi wrote in independent Al-Watan (3/30):  "Why </p><p>all the demonstrations against Kuwait? Are the American </p><p>missiles, which strike Iraq, made in Kuwait? Can Kuwait </p><p>prevent the US and Britain from achieving their goals? </p><p>Kuwait is now sharing its food and water with the Iraqis </p><p>while other Arab countries are still chanting in support of </p><p>Saddam. We have offered them food and water-- what have </p><p>other countries offered them?" </p><p> </p><p>8. "Let us Annex Southern Iraq" </p><p>Liberal Faisal Al-Qanai, Secretary General of Kuwait </p><p>Journalists Association, wrote in independent Al-Seyassah </p><p>(3/30): "We do not know where the next Iraqi missile will </p><p>strike. We are not concerned about any Arab League </p><p>statement, because we will not see one of condemnation [of </p><p>missile attacks on Kuwait]. This outrageous Iraqi attack on </p><p>us [on March 29] gives us justification to defend ourselves </p><p>by allowing Kuwaiti forces to occupy southern Iraq and annex </p><p>it to Al-Jahra governate." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
