<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 001744 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, NEA/NGA, EUR/SE, PMAT, AND L; OSD FOR ISA, ISP </p><p>AND LEGAL; JCS FOR J3, J5 AND LEGAL; EUCOM FOR GEN. WALD, </p><p>J3, J4, J5, POLAD; CENTCOM FOR J3, J5 AND POLAD; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH GENERAL STAFF TEMPORARILY SUSPENDS OEF </p><p>BLANKET CLEARANCE </p><p> </p><p>(u) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) The Embassy learned late March 18 from AMCC Incirlik </p><p>that the Turkish General Staff (TGS) has temporarily </p><p>suspended the blanket clearance that the GOT had provided the </p><p>US for aircraft in support of Operation Enduring Freedom </p><p>(OEF).  TGS Deputy J3 for Command and Control Maj. Gen. Ozer </p><p>reportedly took the decision to suspend the clearance after </p><p>learning that three USAF-contracted 747 aircraft had used the </p><p>blanket clearance to bring into Incirlik Air Base cargo in </p><p>support of site preparations.  Ozer shares the widely-held </p><p>view among GOT civilian and military officials that the OEF </p><p>blanket clearance does not/not apply to aircraft delivering </p><p>site preparation-related material. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The DATT has requested a meeting with Maj. Gen. Ozer </p><p>to discuss the issue in an effort to clarify any </p><p>misunderstanding that may have occurred and attempt to have </p><p>the OEF blanket clearance reinstated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Comment:  In the Turks\' minds, activities related to </p><p>Operation Enduring Freedom and those related to contingency </p><p>operations against Iraq (including site preparations) are </p><p>distinct and unrelated.  MFA and TGS officials have cautioned </p><p>us against using OEF-related arrangements and procedures for </p><p>site preparation or other Iraq-related activities.  In turn, </p><p>the Embassy, EUCOM Forward and the Office of Defense </p><p>Cooperation (ODC) have taken a number of steps to ensure </p><p>that, in the case of Iraq-related activities, the USG </p><p>continues to operate in Turkey within the strict confines of </p><p>the terms of the site preparation MOU.  The recent incident </p><p>involving the USAF-contracted 747\'s that resulted in a </p><p>suspension of our OEF blanket clearance is an important </p><p>reminder of the GOT sensitivities on Iraq-related activity in </p><p>Turkey and highlights the importance of making sure that we </p><p>continue to operate according to the agreed upon arrangements </p><p>with the Turks. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
