Radikal/Tercuman/Dunya: The Undersecretary </p><p>for Customs Ministry, Nevzat Saygilioglu, </p><p>announced that the border trade that would be </p><p>realized through Border Trade Centers would </p><p>initially be opened at the gates with Syria. </p><p>Saygilioglu said border trade centers would be </p><p>founded in the customs zones on an area of 2000 </p><p>square meters and would mainly target trade with </p><p>local businessmen and passengers. Goods belonging </p><p>to both countries would be marketed at the </p><p>shopping centers expected to become operational </p><p>in June. The model shopping centers along the </p><p>Syrian border will be opened at the gates in </p><p>Cilvegozu and Yayladag (Hatay), Karkamis </p><p>(Gaziantep), Oncupinar (Sanliurfa, and Nusaybin </p><p>(Mardin). Such trade centers will in turn be </p><p>opened at the border gates with Iran, Georgia, </p><p>and Nakhichevan. Saygilioglu said Turkey expected </p><p>a volume of USD 150-200 million turnover in trade </p><p>at the five trade centers to be opened along the </p><p>Syrian border, and added that type of trade would </p><p>revive the economy and create employment </p><p>opportunities in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Evrensel: Abdullah Ocalan\'s sister and </p><p>lawyers who went to Gemlik in order to visit </p><p>Abdullah Ocalan at Imrali prison were not taken </p><p>to the island by the officials on the grounds of </p><p>diverse weather conditions. For the same reasons, </p><p>Ocalan\'s sister and attorneys were denied a visit </p><p>to Ocalan last week. One of Ocalan\'s lawyers, </p><p>Aysel Tugluk, announced they had been denied the </p><p>meeting with their client on the pretext of </p><p>"diverse weather conditions" despite the fact the </p><p>weather was clear and sunny. She added  they had </p><p>been prevented from seeing Ocalan for 14 weeks </p><p>because of officials\' decision some time ago. </p><p>Urging sensitivity to the issue, attorney Tugluk </p><p>demanded ending the discrimination, and the </p><p>application of special anti-democratic laws </p><p>against their client, calling for unrestricted </p><p>practice of his democratic rights, and ending his </p><p>isolation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Cumhuriyet: The National Security Directorate </p><p>announced 35 persons had committed suicide out of </p><p>1.7 million people detained in the past 8 years. </p><p>The report said the majority of the ones who </p><p>committed suicide were urban dwellers aged </p><p>between 15-24. The ratio of the kind of suicide </p><p>taking place in Turkey is as follows: 51 percent </p><p>by hanging themselves, 17 percent by fire </p><p>weapons, 13 percent by jumping from heights. 36 </p><p>percent of people committing suicide have been </p><p>doing so due to mental disorder. The report which </p><p>also examined suicides in detention rooms between </p><p>1995-2002, announced that 35 persons had </p><p>committed suicide out of 1.7 million detainees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.

The report disclosed </p><p>that women constituted 56.9 percent of 144 </p><p>suicides last year, Batman taking the lead with </p><p>46, and Diyarbakir coming second with 31 cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.
