<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006522 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: "JORDAN FIRST": KING SEEKS TO PROMOTE LOYALTY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  In mid-October, the GOJ rolled out an </p><p>extensive public relations campaign to promote its new </p><p>"Jordan First" domestic political initiative.  Billboards, </p><p>signs and posters emblazoned with the motto "al-Urdun </p><p>Awaalan" (Jordan First) and a Jordanian flag held aloft by </p><p>five hands (each representing a different segment of </p><p>Jordanian society) are now displayed throughout the country. </p><p>On October 30, the King articulated his conception of "Jordan </p><p>First" in more detail in a letter to PM Ali Abul Ragheb, and </p><p>instructed the PM to form a "Jordan First" committee to </p><p>implement it.  Reactions to the initiative in the media and </p><p>in our discussions with Jordanians have thus far been mixed, </p><p>and will be reported septel.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>JORDAN FIRST IN ELECTIONS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The King first discussed "Jordan First" in the </p><p>context of planned forthcoming elections in Jordan.  On </p><p>October 9, the King discussed the initiative during an </p><p>interview with Pan-Arab satellite station MBC, which was </p><p>printed in its entirety by the Jordanian media.  The King </p><p>said that "elections should be national, bearing a national </p><p>agenda, and within the frame of the slogan \'Jordan first\'." </p><p>Continuing, the King said that he would prefer "two or three" </p><p>political parties (as opposed to the current 30) and was </p><p>critical of the fact that many fringe parties, such as the </p><p>Communists and Ba\'athists, are directed by movements outside </p><p>of Jordan.  Turning to the Muslim Brotherhood, the King said </p><p>that, "for the sake of fairness, the Islamic current in </p><p>Jordan and the Muslim Brothers in particular, were very </p><p>devoted to the interests of Jordan.  But unfortunately, there </p><p>are links between this party and other parties outside </p><p>Jordan." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The same week, billboards, placards and posters </p><p>emblazoned with the motto "al-Urdan Awaaalan" and a Jordanian </p><p>flag held aloft by five hands were displayed around the </p><p>country.  Note:  The five hands holding the flag include a </p><p>female\'s, a soldier\'s, one cuffed in traditional Palestinian </p><p>attire, a muscled hand of a laborer, and a manicured hand of </p><p>a professional. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>JORDAN FIRST IN LOYALTIES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  On October 30, the King presented a Royal Letter to </p><p>PM Ali Abul Ragheb explaining the campaign\'s purpose as "an </p><p>axial idea and national starting point from where we embark </p><p>on thinking and acting, and to serve as a tool to measure </p><p>performance and true citizenship."  Arguing that this </p><p>national principle is already embedded in the conscience of </p><p>Jordanians, the King wrote that "We want to establish this </p><p>principle as a working approach and a daily practice for each </p><p>Jordanian man and woman who believes in this country as a </p><p>cradle of security and stability, and one which has a </p><p>promising future; those who seek fulfillment through their </p><p>native land, and not via external loyalties whatever the </p><p>goals and objectives are." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  The King also named 31 prominent individuals, whom he </p><p>called on to form a committee to "look into the best ways and </p><p>mechanisms to convey the \'Jordan First\' message and establish </p><p>it as a daily practice in the educational, economic, social </p><p>and development circles."  On October 31 the King chaired the </p><p>committee\'s first meeting. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>JORDAN FIRST\'S \'NOBLE MESSAGE\' </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  In a clear reference to those (either East-Bankers or </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanians) who </p><p>may try to use "Jordan First" to support their narrow East </p><p>Bank or West Bank agendas, the </p><p>King said that "Jordan First" must have "complete immunity </p><p>against negative ideas and </p><p>accusative misinterpretations that, willfully or not, try to </p><p>deal with \'Jordan First\' out </p><p>of its comprehensive pure and noble context into narrow </p><p>visions that we do not, and cannot </p><p>accept."  Turning to the press, he said that "Jordan\'s press </p><p>should also give prominence to </p><p>deal with local issues and the concerns of citizens in a </p><p>sense of responsibility and </p><p>patriotism, before any external issue." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  "Jordan First" is an effort to re-focus Jordanians\' </p><p>attention to issues that the King believes are more important </p><p>for Jordan during a time of increased regional tension.  Now </p><p>that the King has articulated the meaning behind the </p><p>billboards, "Jordan first" has become a leading topic of </p><p>discussion among Jordanians.  A full readout of local </p><p>reaction will be reported septel. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
