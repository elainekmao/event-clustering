THE DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO </p><p>MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, GIANFRANCO GIORGOLO, UNDERSCORED </p><p>THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE WILL ESTABLISH A CLEAR </p><p>REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN ITALY FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) MINISTRY OFFICIALS HIGHLIGHTED AREAS IN WHICH EX </p><p>ANTE REGULATION MAY BE WARRANTED. THEY INCLUDE CALL </p><p>ORIGINATION AND CALL TERMINATION; TRANSIT SERVICE; WHOLESALE </p><p>TRUNK LEASED LINES AND UNBUNDLED ACCESS; BROADCASTING </p><p>SERVICES AND WHOLESALE BROADBAND SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>THE MARKET - EUROPE AND ITALY </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) COMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITY OFFICIALS SHARED WITH THE </p><p>U.S. DELEGATION INFORMATION FROM A SOON-TO-BE RELEASED </p><p>COMMISSION REPORT ON THE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THIS REPORT, EU COUNTRIES ACCOUNT FOR 25 PERCENT OF THE WORLD </p><p>MARKET FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS.  IN 2003, GIVEN THE RECESSION </p><p>IN THE EURO-ZONE, THE SHARE IS EXPECTED TO CONTRACT BY ONE </p><p>PERCENT, WITH ASIA\'S SHARE INCREASING PROPORTIONALLY.  MOBILE </p><p>SERVICES, NOT INCLUDING HARDWARE, ACCOUNT FOR 37 PERCENT OF </p><p>ALL TELECOM SERVICES IN EUROPE.  SUBSCRIBERS FOR MOBILE </p><p>SERVICES IN THE EU REACHED 213 MILLION IN 2002.  PRE-PAID </p><p>CARDS ACCOUNT FOR A SIZABLE MARKET SHARE.  IN ITALY, 78 </p><p>PERCENT OF USERS OF MOBILE SERVICES USE PRE-PAID CARDS.  TEXT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01084  02 OF 04  171344Z </p><p>MESSAGING AND INTERNET ON CELL PHONES ACCOUNT FOR AN </p><p>ESTIMATED 10 PERCENT OF REVENUES FOR MOBILE OPERATORS IN </p><p>EUROPE.  THE INTERNET HAS SPURRED GROWTH IN THE FIXED LINE </p><p>MARKET AS WELL.  FIXED LINE TELEPHONY GREW 10 PERCENT FROM </p><p>2001 TO 2002 IN EUROPE; EUROPE NOW HAS MORE THAN 329 MILLION </p><p>FIXED LINES. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) IN EUROPE, AND PARTICULARLY IN ITALY, THE MARKET FOR </p><p>MOBILE IS NEARLY SATURATED. COMPETITION WILL BE FOCUSED ON </p><p>PRICE, COMMENTED AUTHORITY OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>3G/BROADBAND/WI-FI </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) FIVE 3G LICENSES HAVE BEEN ISSUED, ONE EACH TO H3G </p><p>ITALIA, IPSE 2000, TELECOM ITALIA MOBILE (TIM), </p><p>OMNITEL-VODAFONE, WIND.  THE LICENSES ARE FOR 20 YEARS, WITH </p><p>COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS OF PROVISIONS TO REGIONS BY 2004 AND TO </p><p>PROVINCIAL CAPITALS BY 2006.  ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRY, TWO </p><p>OPERATORS, TIM AND H3G, ARE NEARLY READY TO BEGIN OPERATIONS. </p><p> H3G IS EXPECTED TO START LIMITED SERVICE IN THE SUMMER.  THE </p><p>GOI IS EXPLORING DIFFERENT INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE 3G </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  ONE BARRIER TO START UP IS THE DIFFERENT </p><p>REGIONAL STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC MAGNETIC TRANSMISSION </p><p>EMISSIONS (EMTS).  THE GOI IS WORKING WITH REGIONAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO SET A NATIONAL STANDARD FOR EMISSIONS, AND </p><p>WILL UNDERTAKE A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO ASSUAGE THE </p><p>PUBLIC\'S CONCERNS ABOUT EMTS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF BROADBAND IS A KEY </p><p>GOAL FOR THE MINISTRY, AND FOR THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT AS A </p><p>WHOLE.  MINISTRY OFFICIALS INDICATED THAT BROADBAND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01084  02 OF 04  171344Z </p><p>DEVELOPMENT WILL BE ONE OF THE ITALY\'S PRIORITIES AS EU </p><p>PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) THE GOVERNMENT IS FINE-TUNING A PLAN FOR BROADBAND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, WHICH INCLUDES PUBLIC FUNDING OF NEARLY ONE </p><p>BILLION EUROS OVER FIVE YEARS FOR PUBLIC DEMAND/USE.  THE </p><p>MINISTRY FOR INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY HAS CREATED AN </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FOR BROADBAND DEVELOPMENT.  THE EVENTUAL </p><p>AIM OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS IS TO HAVE BROADBAND COVERAGE </p><p>FOR 85-90 PERCENT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, 65 PERCENT OF </p><p>BUSINESSES AND 35 PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS.  COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>MINISTRY OFFICIALS ARGUED THAT BROADBAND\'S POTENTIAL IN ITALY </p><p>IS GREATER THAN IN THE REST OF EUROPE.  GIVEN ITALY\'S VARIED </p><p>TOPOGRAPHY AND ITS ANCIENT RUINS, THE LAYING OF CABLE LINES </p><p>PROVED DIFFICULT.  CABLE TRANSMISSION NEVER TOOK OFF. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) WI-FI HAS JUST BEGUN IN ITALY, ACKNOWLEDGED MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIALS.  ITALY\'S NATIONAL PLAN FOR FREQUENCIES ENVISIONS </p><p>THREE BANDS FOR WI-FI.  A DECREE ISSUED IN FEBRUARY OPENS </p><p>ACCESS TO WI-FI, BOTH FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE USE.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>NO OFFICIAL LICENSE IS REQUIRED, POTENTIAL WI-FI OPERATORS </p><p>MUST INFORM THE MINISTRY PRIOR TO STARTING UP OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>TERMINATION COSTS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2204 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01084  03 OF 04  171345Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CIP-00   CTME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     UTED-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-01  PER-00   ACE-00   SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------458FF5  171345Z /38 </p><p>R 171239Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8754 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF JUSTICE WASHDC </p><p>FCC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 001084 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCE FOR NTIA/GALLAGHER/SPECK; USDOC FOR </p><p>4220/MAC/EUR/SED/DDEFALCO; FCC FOR AGOMEZ AND ATHOMAS; </p><p>JUSTICE FOR CWILLNER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01084  03 OF 04  171345Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ETRD, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S./ITALY BILATERAL TALKS ON COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>POLICY: FROM BROADBAND TO WI-FI TO CYBER SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) THE TERMINATION COST OF FIXED TO MOBILE NETWORKS IN </p><p>ITALY IS IN EXCESS OF COSTS.  U.S. FIRMS HAVE COMPLAINED </p><p>ABOUT THESE COSTS, AND IN JANUARY 2003, COMPTEL FILED A </p><p>COMPLAINT IN THE OFFICE OF THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE\'S </p><p>(USTR\'S) SECTION 1377 REVIEW.  WHILE THE U.S. DELEGATION </p><p>PRAISED THE AUTHORITY\'S RECENT DECISION TO SET NEW TARIFFS </p><p>FOR FIXED TO MOBILE INTERCONNECTION, AT 14.95 EURO CENTS FOR </p><p>TERMINATION, A REDUCTION BY 12 PERCENT, THE U.S. ALSO </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR FUTURE REDUCTIONS.  REGULATORY </p><p>OFFICIALS TOLD THE U.S. DELEGATION THAT THEY PLAN TO REDUCE </p><p>TERMINATION COSTS FURTHER IN 2004 AND 2005, IN THE RANGE OF </p><p>20 PERCENT, AND WILL INTRODUCE A NEW BASKET OF FIVE SERVICES </p><p>SUBJECT TO A PRICE CAP. </p><p> </p><p>MULTILATERAL ISSUES - ITU, WRC, WSIS </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) THE TWO DELEGATIONS DISCUSSED AT LENGTH THEIR </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THE MARRAKECH MEETING OF THE </p><p>ITU PLENIPOTENTIARY WHICH TOOK PLACE IN OCTOBER 2002. </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR GIORGOLO UNDERSCORED THE GOI\'S FRUSTRATION </p><p>WITH THE MEETING AND CONCERN THAT ITALY\'S POSITIONS WERE NOT </p><p>HEARD.  IN PARTICULAR, ITALY IS CONCERNED THAT ITS REDUCTION </p><p>IN CONTRIBUTION BY FIVE UNITS WILL LEAD TO A COMMENSURATE </p><p>LOSS IN INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01084  03 OF 04  171345Z </p><p>16. (SBU) THE U.S. IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FOCUS OF THE ITU, </p><p>COMMENTED AMBASSADOR GROSS.  THE U.S. WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH </p><p>THE "COMPROMISE" THAT FORCED COUNTRIES TO REDUCE THEIR </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED VALUE OF EACH SHARE. </p><p>THE U.S. WANTED THE VALUE OF EACH SHARE TO STAY THE SAME. </p><p>GROSS NOTED THE USG\'S CONCERN ABOUT THE PREMATURE </p><p>ELECTIONEERING OF POTENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR ITU; ELECTIONS ARE </p><p>NOT FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) FABIO BIGI, SENIOR COUNSELOR FOR THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS, ARGUED THAT THE CENTRAL ROLE OF THE ITU AFTER </p><p>MARRAKECH SHOULD BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORLDWIDE </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS.  THE GENERAL SECRETARIAT SHOULD SUPPORT </p><p>ACTIVITY OF THE RADIOCOMMUNICATION, STANDARDIZATION, AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT SECTORS.  THE COST OF RUNNING THE ITU, HE ARGUED, </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE INCREASED.  THE SECRETARIAT SHOULD EVALUATE THE </p><p>ITU\'S SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, ESTABLISH PRIORITIES, AND </p><p>IMPROVE MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY.  THE ITU SHOULD </p><p>UNDERTAKE STEPS TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, HE URGED.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE ITU SHOULD FAVOR THE UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) MINISTRY OFFICIALS EXPRESSED THEIR HOPE THAT THE </p><p>ITU WILL CONDUCT STUDIES TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF 3G </p><p>SYSTEMS.  THE ITU ALSO SHOULD WORK ON FREQUENCY BAND </p><p>ALLOCATIONS.  IN PREVIOUS ITU CONFERENCES, THEY NOTED, SOME </p><p>FREQUENCY BANDS WERE IDENTIFIED AND ISSUED.  SUCH ALLOCATIONS </p><p>ARE ESSENTIAL, THEY ARGUED, TO GIVE COMPATIBILITY TO 3G </p><p>SYSTEMS AND TO ENCOURAGE THE VIABILITY OF GALILEO. </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) BIGI, GIORGOLO, AND OTHER ITALIAN DELEGATES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01084  03 OF 04  171345Z </p><p>UNDERSCORED THEIR EAGERNESS TO WORK WITH THE U.S. ON ITU AND </p><p>OTHER MULTILATERAL ISSUES.  THEY NOTED THAT IT WAS OBVIOUS IN </p><p>MARRAKECH THAT THE U.S. AND ITALY SHARED ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE SAME POSITIONS.  THE TWO GOVERNMENTS COULD HAVE COMBINED </p><p>STRATEGIES AND TACTICS, BIGI COMMENTED.  THE GOI EMPHASIZED </p><p>ITS DESIRE TO WORK WITH THE U.S. IN THE LEAD UP TO THE WRC IN </p><p>JUNE AND THE WORLD SUMMIT ON THE INFORMATION SOCIETY IN </p><p>DECEMBER.  REGARDING THE WRC, ITALY\'S POSITION ON WIRELESS </p><p>LOCAL AREA NETWORKS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE EU CONSENSUS, </p><p>GIORGOLO POINTED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>LEGAL FRAMEWORK </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) AT THE TIME OF THE BILATERALS, MINISTRY UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY INNOCENZI WAS TESTIFYING BEFORE PARLIAMENT ON THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>LEGGE GASPARRI (THE LAW NAMED AFTER MINISTER OF </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS GASPARRI).  THE BILL, INTRODUCED TO PARLIAMENT </p><p>IN SEPTEMBER 2002, FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON MEDIA OWNERSHIP. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MINISTRY OFFICIALS, THE BILL IS BASED ON AN </p><p>INTEGRATED ANTI-TRUST REGIME, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT </p><p>EVERYTHING FROM TELEVISION, INTERNET, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, </p><p>PUBLISHING.
