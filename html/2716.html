<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001068 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RIYADH FOR RUSS HANKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2027 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PGOV, KDEM, PHUM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA,S OBASANJO IN TROUBLE IN THE NORTH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 829 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5(b) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.      (U) Summary:  President Olusegun Obasanjo\'s probable </p><p>re-election bid faces deep opposition in the North, but </p><p>he seems to have a strategy for recovery.  Nigeria\'s </p><p>leader benefits from a lack of credible opponents and </p><p>the apparent readiness of some Northern elites to join </p><p>his government, if the enticement is right.  All the </p><p>same, growing numbers of Northerners are praying for new </p><p>blood.  A recent pronouncement by Sokoto Governor </p><p>Bafarawa highlighted northern unhappiness.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) During a recent trip to Kano and Kaduna, DCM spoke </p><p>with 15 northern political and business figures, only one of </p><p>whom holds a remunerative position in the GON.  Just one (not </p><p>the one receiving GON money) felt President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>popularity had grown during the preceding six months.  The </p><p>other 14 saw varying degrees of decline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Recurring themes in the conversations included </p><p>interlocutors\' strongly-expressed hopes that the U.S. would </p><p>"do something" to convince Obasanjo that he was on the wrong </p><p>path and to discourage him from seeking a second term.  Fear </p><p>of violence associated with campaigning was pervasive.  More </p><p>general concerns about insecurity were also often expressed. </p><p>(One businessman commented that the area where he resides had </p><p>experienced four armed robberies in 11 years, three of them </p><p>in the past two years.)  GON failure to address corruption </p><p>effectively was also a key theme.   VP Atiku Abubakar\'s </p><p>reported interest in Kabo Air came up several times; Kabo </p><p>once again won the largest share of the Hajj airlift contract </p><p>and once again stranded some pilgrims in Saudi Arabia for </p><p>nearly a month after Eid el-Adha. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Those who had never liked Obasanjo unsurprisingly </p><p>were the most critical.  The Obasanjo Administration\'s lack </p><p>of support for agriculture was a particular sore point in </p><p>this agriculture-dependent part of the country.  However, </p><p>even Obasanjo\'s supporters were showing doubts.  Dr. Liman </p><p>Ciroma, a highly influential northern elder, said he found </p><p>himself increasingly isolated when expressing the view that </p><p>the North should accept another four years with Obasanjo at </p><p>the helm.  Indeed, the bill of particulars against the Head </p><p>of State was powerful, Ciroma conceded, particularly when </p><p>measured against the hopes and aspirations of Northerners. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Ciroma is holding his fire in public, while erstwhile </p><p>Obasanjo supporter Sokoto Governor Attahiru Bafarawa </p><p>delivered a blistering indictment of the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration on the closing day of a seminar on peace and </p><p>harmony in the North.  Ambassador heard from the Chairman of </p><p>the Northern Governors\' Conference that Bafarawa\'s speech was </p><p>formulated at a Conference meeting and had the endorsement of </p><p>all Northern Governors.  Held in Kaduna March 27-28, under </p><p>the auspices of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), the </p><p>seminar brought together many of the best-known Northern </p><p>elites.  Bafawara blasted Obasanjo and the GON for alleged </p><p>anti-Northern biases and failure to deliver on even his most </p><p>basic campaign promises.  In an effort to blunt the expected </p><p>attack and to cast doubt on ACF\'s claim to speak for the </p><p>entire North (not just Hausas, Fulanis and assimilated ethnic </p><p>groups), Obasanjo loyalists arranged for pro-OO political </p><p>figures from the Middle Belt to announce their support for </p><p>the President almost simultaneously.  Few of these </p><p>individuals pack much political punch, and press play has </p><p>focused on interpreting and dissecting Bafarawa\'s attack to </p><p>the near exclusion of reporting the Middle Belters\' </p><p>encomiums. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Ciroma said he and some other northern leaders were </p><p>now actively searching for alternatives to Obasanjo.  One </p><p>option under consideration was former Head of State Yakubu </p><p>Gowon; another was former Commonwealth Secretary-General </p><p>Emeka Anyaoku.  Ciroma admitted that Gowon was past his prime </p><p>and that his accomplishments as Head of State were less than </p><p>stellar.  However, he would likely bring most of the Middle </p><p>Belt along, as well as a measure of stability.  Anyaoku would </p><p>rally Igbo votes while being acceptable to most Northerners, </p><p>Ciroma thought.  In our view, neither Gowon nor Anyaoku would </p><p>inspire many voters; it would take tremendous resources to </p><p>make them viable alternatives to current contenders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) While Ciroma and many others look to tried and true </p><p>political players, younger Northerners (and some of their </p><p>elders) grow restless and seek generational change.  They </p><p>dislike the choices they see before them now:  Obasanjo, </p><p>Babangida or Atiku.  Few have any name to offer; most say </p><p>they are praying for divine intervention and express hope </p><p>that the USG will "do something" to convince Obasanjo to </p><p>"adopt the Mandela option." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Though some believe Obasanjo ultimately will not run, </p><p>all indications today point to him seeking a second term. </p><p>The parade of sycophants calling on him to stay thickens </p><p>daily, a sure sign of his own current thinking.  Moreover, </p><p>some around him (notably Works and Housing Minister Anenih) </p><p>are recruiting for the Cabinet, not just for the final year </p><p>of this term, but for the next as well.  According to one </p><p>young Northerner, Anenih\'s plan is to bring a few old </p><p>Northern warhorses, such as Lawal Kaita and Umaru Shinkafi, </p><p>out of the stables for the run-up to the 2003 elections in </p><p>the belief that their presence will foil efforts to bring </p><p>forth a unified Northern challenge.  Additional credence is </p><p>given to this story by recent generally positive comments on </p><p>GON performance and Obasanjo from Kaita ("Tell") and Shinkafi </p><p>("Trust").  After the election, Obasanjo would replace the </p><p>old warhorses with younger steeds, Anenih is said to be </p><p>telling potential younger steeds (in order to keep them from </p><p>bucking this strategy).  Meanwhile, Obasanjo himself </p><p>reportedly told media on April 1 that he was beginning a </p><p>14-day fast, in order to obtain proper guidance from God and </p><p>the Nigerian people.  At the fast\'s end, he would announce </p><p>his intentions for 2003.  Thirteen days and counting. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
