<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000230 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: FEBRUARY 3 TREASON TRIAL OF MDC PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  The common law treason trial of three Movement for </p><p>Democratic Change (MDC) leaders -- President Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai, Secretary-General Welshman Ncube, and Member of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Parliament Renson Gasela -- is scheduled to begin in </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s High Court on Monday, February 3.  The trial was </p><p>originally scheduled for November 11, 2002 but was postponed </p><p>after state prosecutors failed to provide certain evidence </p><p>requested by the defense attorneys.  The GOZ is alleging </p><p>that, in the months leading to the March 2002 presidential </p><p>election, the three MDC officials plotted the assassination </p><p>of President Mugabe with a lobbying firm headed by notorious </p><p>businessman Ari Ben-Menashe. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Innocent Chagonda, a member of the MDC\'s legal team, was </p><p>confident about the defense\'s case when we spoke to him on </p><p>January 30.  He seemed to relish the prospect of </p><p>cross-examining principal GOZ witness Ben-Menashe, whose </p><p>credibility likely will not be difficult to impugn.  He even </p><p>suspected that Ben-Menashe might not appear at trial, as </p><p>prosecutors refused to share their witness list. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Most independent observers of Zimbabwe\'s political scene </p><p>have dismissed the charges as a transparent attempt to keep </p><p>the pressure on Zimbabwe\'s principal opposition party by </p><p>forcing it to commit scarce resources to legal counsel, and </p><p>that the case provided a convenient excuse to confiscate the </p><p>passports of the three accused.  The MDC certainly has reason </p><p>to feel confident -- its legal team, led by renowned South </p><p>African attorney George Bizos, is strong, and the state\'s </p><p>evidence is, at best, flimsy.   However, the stakes are very </p><p>high and there are signs which should worry the MDC.  High </p><p>Court Judge Paddington Garwe has opted to handle this case </p><p>himself, and Garwe is well-known as a ruling party </p><p>sympathizer.  In fact, Garwe dismissed several MDC challenges </p><p>to 2000 parliamentary election results although the </p><p>opposition party presented overwhelming evidence of political </p><p>violence and electoral manipulation.  Under common law, Garwe </p><p>will have significant leeway in determining whether to </p><p>convict -- he would be more constrained had Tsvangirai been </p><p>charged under a particular statute with treason -- and in </p><p>determining the length of any prison sentence should there be </p><p>a conviction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
