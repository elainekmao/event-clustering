<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004912 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, E, EB, E/CBED, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ETTC, PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: BOTAS ON IRAQI OIL AND GAZPROM </p><p> </p><p>Classified by EconCouns Scot Marciel, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary.  BOTAS General Manager Mehmet Bilgic told us </p><p>August 1 that a 10-person BOTAS technical team was in Iraq </p><p>with Iraqi officials to inspect the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik </p><p>pipeline and help get the oil flowing again as soon as </p><p>possible.  Bilgic asked about the veracity of a recent news </p><p>report that U.S. authorities in Iraq planned to export all </p><p>oil through southern Iraq and close the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik </p><p>pipeline.  Bilgic said BOTAS and Gazprom had agreed to resume </p><p>the Blue Stream gas flow, but were still "discussing" </p><p>outstanding issues in all of their bilateral gas contracts. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BOTAS Team in Iraq </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Bilgic told EconCouns and econoff August 1 that </p><p>BOTAS had sent a 10-person technical team to Iraq on July 30 </p><p>to inspect the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline and help get </p><p>operations started as soon as possible.  Bilgic said the team </p><p>-- including 3 pump station engineers, 3 pipeline </p><p>communication system experts, 2 firefighters, and 2 </p><p>assistants -- was working with Iraqi Oil Ministry officials. </p><p>Bilgic said the team\'s preliminary report indicated that the </p><p>pipeline was in better condition than expected, but they </p><p>still had not seen the entire pipeline.  He noted that one of </p><p>the problems was lack of communication along the pipeline. </p><p>Bilgic said BOTAS wanted to get the oil flowing from Kirkuk </p><p>as soon as possible, and had offered to help the Iraqis </p><p>achieve this.  He said he hoped pipeline operations could </p><p>resume in August, but would not know until his team returned </p><p>from Iraq whether that was feasible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Bilgic said he had seen a recent news article </p><p>suggesting that U.S. authorities in Iraq planned on exporting </p><p>all oil through southern Iraq, and no longer planned on using </p><p>the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline.  EconCouns responded that </p><p>there was no such plan, and that authorities in Baghdad were </p><p>working hard to export oil from both the north and south. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Relations with DEPA, Gazprom </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Bilgic said he had had good meetings with DEPA in </p><p>Greece in mid-July.  He said he reiterated BOTAS\' interest in </p><p>DEPA privatization, and continued the dialogue on the </p><p>Greece-Turkey interconnect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Referring to BOTAS\' recent dispute with Gazprom over </p><p>the price formula in the Blue Stream contract, Bilgic said </p><p>the two companies had decided to resume the Blue Stream gas </p><p>flow as of August 1.  He said the companies still had </p><p>"disagreements" regarding all of their gas contracts (Blue </p><p>Stream, Russia West 1 and Russia West 2), including issues </p><p>regarding price, "take-or-pay" provisions, and duration of </p><p>the contracts.  Indicating that BOTAS paid a higher price for </p><p>gas than Gazprom\'s other clients, Bilgic said it was his hope </p><p>that BOTAS and Gazprom could reach an accommodation that </p><p>would allow all parties to continue implementing the </p><p>contracts. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
