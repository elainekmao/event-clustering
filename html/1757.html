<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001375 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS ALSO FOR OECD </p><p>E for WMCGLYNN </p><p>EB/IFD/OMA FOR PREID </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO EX/IM FOR DSOMERVILLE, DSCHNEIDER </p><p>AND ROBINSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 16JUN11 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEBT NEGOTIATIONS STALL; PLANS FOR </p><p>         AN EXPANSIONARY SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET DENIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) CARRIG-MULLINAX 12JUN01 EMAIL, </p><p>      B) STATE 97771, C) STATE 79460, </p><p>      D) TURNER-CARRIG 3MAY01 EMAIL, </p><p>      E) HESS-ARIKAWE LETTER DATED 3MAY01 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F Jeter; reason 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) At meetings in Abuja June 11 and 12, senior </p><p>GON economic policy-makers were thoroughly pessimistic </p><p>regarding near term prospects for achieving consensus </p><p>on the U.S.-Nigeria Bilateral Debt Agreement required </p><p>to implement the December 2000 Paris Club </p><p>rescheduling.  A.S. Arikawe, Debt Management Office </p><p>Chief, opined that the GON would request a three-month </p><p>extension on Paris Club bilaterals so that the U.S. </p><p>and nine other creditor nations might "develop </p><p>reasonable positions" on debt relief.  Policy-makers </p><p>were dismissive of press reports that the GON intended </p><p>to double its spending for 2001.  Nevertheless, </p><p>Principal Secretary to the President Steve Oronsaye\'s </p><p>logic for contending that a 130 billion naira </p><p>"supplementary budget" would have "absolutely zero" </p><p>net effect on capital spending for the year is as </p><p>opaque for us as it is for the IMF.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) TDY U.S. Treasury Advisor Lisa Cook and </p><p>Economic Section Chief met June 11 with Principal </p><p>Secretary to the President Steve Oronsaye and Director </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>General of the Debt Management Office Mr. A.S. Arikawe </p><p>for discussions regarding a debt swap for environment </p><p>clean-up initiative (Ref B and Septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In subsequent side-bar conversations with </p><p>EconChief, the GON interlocutors commented on the </p><p>state-of-play regarding the Bilateral Debt </p><p>Rescheduling Agreement (Refs C, D and E) and a rumored </p><p>supplementary budget that media reports held would </p><p>double the expansionary 2001 spending plan approved </p><p>already by the National Legislature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Bilateral Rescheduling Agreement </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Arikawe was thoroughly pessimistic on </p><p>prospects for a near-term and successful conclusion to </p><p>U.S.-Nigeria negotiations regarding the bilateral debt </p><p>rescheduling agreement required to implement the </p><p>December 2000 Paris Club rescheduling.  He declared </p><p>several USG provisions within the agreement </p><p>"unacceptable to Nigeria" and "impossible" to fulfill </p><p>because they were "too contentious."  Arikawe declined </p><p>to identify any provisions he found unacceptable, </p><p>beyond those concerning payment of "reasonable </p><p>expenses" incurred in contract enforcement actions and </p><p>unilateral suspension rights as already noted in para </p><p>6, Ref C. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.   (U) However, Arikawe promised (for the third time </p><p>since our initial request shortly after his May 3 </p><p>meeting at the Department with Treasury, State and </p><p>Eximbank officers) to provide the GON position in </p><p>writing by a date certain.  This time his self-imposed </p><p>delivery date is Monday (or Tuesday) June 18 (or 19). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Arikawe volunteered that the U.S. is not the </p><p>only creditor with which the GON has serious </p><p>differences.  He said nine other bilateral agreements </p><p>were similarly stalled.  In a June 12 follow up </p><p>conversation, Arikawe summarized the negotiations\' </p><p>state-of-play by noting that Nigeria planned to </p><p>request a three-month extension for negotiations so </p><p>that Paris Club creditors might have time to "develop </p><p>reasonable positions" on debt relief. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Expansionary Supplementary Budget Denied </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Oronsaye opened the discussion regarding a </p><p>supplementary budget on his own volition.  He </p><p>acknowledged that, indeed, there would be a </p><p>supplementary budget.  However, he averred, press </p><p>reports describing official sources as confirming the </p><p>President\'s approval of a supplementary budget </p><p>doubling the spending already programmed for 2001 were </p><p>"irresponsible and thoroughly false."  He estimated </p><p>that the supplementary would not exceed 130 billion </p><p>naira (vice the 894 billion in some press reports) and </p><p>insisted that none of the supplementary would derive </p><p>from "new" appropriations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) According to Oronsaye, the supplementary </p><p>budget is merely an "administrative necessity" </p><p>mandated by the Constitution and it would have an </p><p>"absolutely zero" net effect on capital spending this </p><p>year.  As he described it, there is a need to </p><p>"prioritize" spending on power production and the </p><p>provision of water to rural areas.  To move these </p><p>projects to the head of the spending queue, he </p><p>continued, requires National Assembly approval since </p><p>the Assembly already had approved capital spending for </p><p>2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Comment.  We found Oronsaye\'s explanation of </p><p>the need for a supplementary budget unconvincing and </p><p>June 12 shared his logic with IMF ResRep R. van Til. </p><p>He, too, was puzzled by Oronsaye\'s comments, but </p><p>pointed out that it is the spending total, not how the </p><p>GON cares to characterize its genesis, that counts as </p><p>the bottom line.  The IMF, he allowed, is more </p><p>concerned that Nigeria remains "off track" on </p><p>virtually all indicators set out last summer for </p><p>policing the now moribund Stand-By Arrangement.  And, </p><p>he said that although Article 4 consultations with the </p><p>GON (in preparation for the June 29 report to IMF\'s </p><p>Executive Board) were scheduled to conclude on Friday, </p><p>June 15, much work still remained to be done.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
