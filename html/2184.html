SUMMARY:  OFDA SENT EDRC JAY NASH TO NORTHERN </p><p>NIGERIA FOR FOUR DAYS TO ASSESS THE FLOODING THERE AND </p><p>TO MAKE A PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER </p><p>ADDITIONAL OFDA SUPPORT (ABOVE AND BEYOND THE $25,000 </p><p>TRANSFERRED AS A RESULT OF THE AMBASSADPR  DISASTER </p><p>DECLARATION) WOULD BE NEEDED.  CROP DAMAGE WAS SEVERE, </p><p>THOUGH THE NUMBERS OF DISPLACED PERSONS WERE NOT </p><p>PARTICULARLY HIGH AND THEIR NEEDS WERE LARGELY BEING </p><p>ADDRESSED BY THE LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS.  FOR  THE </p><p>TIME BEING, THE INITIAL $25,000 IN DISASTER RELIEF </p><p>ASSISTANCE IS SUFFICIENT, AND MONITORING ITS USE BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF RED CROSS SOCIETIES WILL </p><p>GIVE USAID AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER MORE </p><p>EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE (SUCH AS FOOD AND NON-FOOD </p><p>COMMODITIES) IS NEEDED TO COMPLEMENT NIGERIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT EFFORTS.  SHOULD AN INTERNATIONAL NGO BE </p><p>INTERESTED IN ADDITIONAL WORK IN THE AREAS OF SAFE </p><p>WATER AND/OR RECONSTRUCTION, AND USAID NIGERIA CONCURS </p><p>THAT THIS IS A NEED THAT WILL NOT BE MET BY OTHER </p><p>DONORS, OFDA SHOULD BE OPEN TO REVIEWING AND POSSIBLY </p><p>FUNDING PROPOSALS OF THIS TYPE IN THE NEXT MONTH OR </p><p>TWO.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. OFDA DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO EDRC JAY NASH </p><p>VISITED NORTHERN NIGERIA ON TDY FROM MONDAY SEPTEMBER </p><p>17 TO THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 20TH.  THE PURPOSE OF THE TRIP </p><p>WAS TO EVALUATE THE NEED FOR FURTHER OFDA ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>VICTIMS OF THE FLOODS IN KANO AND JIGAWA STATES.  (THE </p><p>INITIAL GRANT OF $25,000 REQUESTED IN THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>DISASTER DECLARATION </p><p>HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED AND </p><p>PROCESSED.)  THE ASSESSMENT INCLUDED THREE DAYS OF </p><p>FIELD VISITS TO FLOOD AFFECTED AREAS, INCLUDING A </p><p>HELICOPTER FLYOVER ON THE THIRD DAY, AS WELL AS </p><p>NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND </p><p>OTHERS INVOLVED IN THE ASSISTANCE EFFORT.  NASH WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY GARBA ABDU OF THE USAID/NIGERIA HEALTH </p><p>UNIT, WHO IS A NATIVE OF NORTHERN NIGERA AND FLUENT </p><p>SPEAKER OF HAUSE  HE DOMINANT LANGUAGE IN THE </p><p>AFFECTED AREA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>GENERAL SITUATION DESCRIPTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. UNUSUALLY HEAVY RAINS IN THE SECOND HALF OF AUGUST </p><p>IN NORTHERN NIGERIA SWELLED THE KANO AND CHALLAWA </p><p>RIVERS, ESPECIALLY AT THE POINT WHERE THE TWO RIVERS </p><p>CONVERGE TO FORM THE KEDEIJA RIVER.  WATER ALSO ROSE </p><p>BEHIND THE TIGA AND CHALLAWA DAMS.  VILLAGES NEAR THE </p><p>RIVERS RESPONDED BY BUILDING DIKES AROUND THE INHABITED </p><p>AREAS, AND IN SOME CASES, AROUND FIELDS.  ON AUGUST </p><p>27TH, HOWEVER, WATER BEGAN SPILLING OVER THE DAMS, </p><p>FLASH-FOODING RESULTED AND THE DIKES OF MANY VILLAGES </p><p>WERE OVERRUN BY THE WATER IN AS LITTLE AS THIRTY </p><p>MINUTES TIME, FORCING THE INHABITANTS OF SOME VILLAGES </p><p>AND CITY WARDS TO FLEE FOR THEIR LIVES.  SOME VILLAGES </p><p>WERE CUT OFF FROM ACCESS TO HIGHER GROUND BEFORE </p><p>VILLAGERS COULD ESCAPE.  THESE PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED IN </p><p>BOATS, OR IN SOME CASES, BY FLOATING ON LARGE </p><p>CALABASHES.  TWENTY  PEOPLE REPORTEDLY DROWNED IN KANO </p><p>STATE, AND 180 IN JIGAWA STATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL WAS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL. ONE WEEK </p><p>OF AUGUST REPORTED AS MUCH RAINFALL AS THE ENTIRE RAINY </p><p>SEASON LAST YEAR. THIS WAS THE FIRST LIFE-ENDANGERING </p><p>FLOODING TO OCCUR IN THE AREA IN LIVING MEMORY, AND THE </p><p>VICTIMS WERE SERIOUSLY TRAUMATIZED.  (MANY ARE </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY EXPRESSING GREAT RELUCTANCE TO RETURN TO </p><p>THE SAME LOCATIONS.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. FORTUNATELY, MOST OF THE DAMAGE WAS TO FARMLANDS </p><p>RATHER THAN INHABITED AREAS.  THE REGION IS NOT DENSELY </p><p>POPULATED, AND MOST VILLAGES OF THE AREA ARE LOCATED </p><p>FAR ENOUGH FROM THE RIVER, AND ON SUFFICIENTLY HIGH </p><p>GROUND, TO AVOID HAVING BEEN FLOODED.  SOME VILLAGES </p><p>AND CITY WARDS, HOWEVER, WERE TOTALLY SUBMERGED, AND </p><p>OTHERS PARTIALLY SUBMERGED, RESULTING IN THE COMPLETE </p><p>LOSS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSES (WHICH, MADE PRIMARILY OF </p><p>MUD, COLLAPSED QUICKLY WHEN EXPOSED TO THE CURRENT). </p><p>THE NUMBER OF VILLAGES AND WARDS WITH HOUSES DAMAGED OR </p><p>DESTROYED BY THE FLOODING IS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN </p><p>30 AND 50.  THE NIGERIAN RED CROSS IS REPORTING SOME </p><p>33,500 PERSONS DISPLACED IN JIGAWA STATE AND 50,000 IN </p><p>KANO STATE, WITH APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE DISPLACED </p><p>CAMPING OUT IN SCHOOLS AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS </p><p>ASSIGNED THEM BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE OTHER </p><p>HALF STAYING WITH RELATIVES OR FRIENDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. THOUGH NOT HEAVILY POPULATED, THE REGION IS, </p><p>HOWEVER, HIGHLY FARMED, WITH ALMOST ALL LAND PLANTED </p><p>WITH ONE CROP OR ANOTHER.  CROP DAMAGE IS THUS </p><p>EXTENSIVE.  MANY FARMERS OF THE AREA HAVE LOST ALL RICE </p><p>AND BEAN FIELDS, WHILE SOME HAVE ALSO LOST MUCH OR ALL </p><p>OF THE MILLET AND GUINEA CORN STAPLE CROPS.  (THE </p><p>DAMAGE TO THE STAPLE MILLET AND GUINEA CORN FIELDS </p><p>WOULD APPEAR TO BE LESS THAN ORIGINALLY FEARED, SINCE </p><p>MANY FIELDS THAT WERE UNDERWATER DRIED WITHIN A WEEK </p><p>AND SINCE THESE TALL PLANTS SEEM NOT TO HAVE SUSTAINED </p><p>MUCH DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF BEING PARTIALLY UNDERWATER </p><p>FOR THAT PERIOD.  THE MILLET AND GUINEA CORN LOSS, </p><p>HOWEVER, MUST STILL BE CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT, </p><p>ESPECIALLY FOR FARMERS WITH FIELDS IN LOWER-LYING AREAS </p><p>OR CLOSE TO THE RIVER BED.)  THE NUMBER OF VILLAGES </p><p>WHOSE CROPS WERE AFFECTED BY THE FLOODING IS REPORTEDLY </p><p>125, AND PROBABLY SOME 500,000 PERSONS (100,000 </p><p>FAMILIES) COULD BE SAID TO BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY </p><p>DAMAGE TO THEIR SUBSISTENCE CROPS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. THOUGH NIGERIA IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO ETHNIC AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS TENSION, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO DATE THAT </p><p>THE FLOOD HAS AGGRAVATED THIS SITUATION.  THERE DOES </p><p>NOT, FOR EXAMPLE, APPEAR TO BE INCREASED </p><p>ETHNIC/RELIGIOUS TENSION AS A RESULT OF THE LIMITED </p><p>POPULATION MOVEMENT TOWARD THE URBAN AREAS.  THE </p><p>AFFECTED VILLAGES ARE LARGELY OF THE SAME ETHNICITY </p><p>(HAUSA-FULANI) AND RELIGION AS THE MAJORITY POPULATIONS </p><p>IN THE NEARBY URBAN AREAS SUCH AS KANO AND WUDIL, AND </p><p>THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NUMEROUS </p><p>ANY WAY TO SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER ANY ETHNIC/RELIGIOUS </p><p>BALANCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>THE RESPONSE TO DATE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. NEARLY ALL THE INITIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FLOOD </p><p>VICTIMS-PRIMARILY THE DISPLACED-TO DATE HAS COME FROM </p><p>THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE AFFECTED AREAS. </p><p>IN KANO STATE, THE STATE RELIEF AND REHABILITATION </p><p>AGENCY HAS ASSISTED THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE </p><p>REGULAR FOOD AID, AS WELL AS NON-FOOD ITEMS, AT REGULAR </p><p>TWO-WEEK INTERVALS TO THE WORST AFFECTED.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>KURA LGA HAS TWICE DELIVERED TO ITS AFFECTED VILLAGES </p><p>500 BLANKETS, 500 50 KG SACKS OF RICE, 200 100KG BAGS </p><p>OF CORN FLOUR, 500 25KG BAGS OF SALT, 600 GALLONS OF </p><p>VEGETABLE OIL, 500 WOMEN  CLOTH WRAPS AND 500 MEN </p><p>BUBUS.  A THIRD </p><p>DISTRIBUTION IS UNDER PREPARATION.  OF </p><p>THESE AMOUNTS, APPROXIMATELY 3/5THS WENT TO THE 1678 </p><p>HARD-HIT FAMILIES OF GAMADAN.  KURA ALSO SAYS THEY </p><p>SPEND ABOUT $450 DAILY ON BREAD PURCHASES FOR THE </p><p>AFFECTED FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JIGAWA STATE HAS ALSO RESPONDED, THOUGH THEIR RESPONSE </p><p>SEEMS A LITTLE LESS CONSISTENT AND REGULAR THAN THAT OF </p><p>KANO STATE.  AT A SCHOOL HOUSING THE DISPLACED FROM A </p><p>PARTIALLY SUBMERGED VILLAGE PEOPLE SAID THEY HAD </p><p>RECEIVED ONE ROUND OF FOOD DISTRIBUTION ONLY, AND WERE </p><p>SERIOUSLY SHORT OF FOOD.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE STATE IN ANOTHER LOCATION NOT FAR AWAY HAD ALREADY </p><p>BEGUN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FIRST OF A PROMISED 500 </p><p>NEW HOUSES.  COMMENT:  THE WALLS OF THIS HOUSE, MADE </p><p>FROM COMPRESSED CEMENT-MUD BRICKS, ARE NEARLY COMPLETE. </p><p>INTENDED, ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE BUILDING IT, FOR JUST </p><p>ONE FAMILY, THE HOUSE IS QUITE LARGE, WITH SEVERAL </p><p>BEDROOMS, AND BOTH OFDA AND USAID/NIGERIA </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES HAD THE STRONG REACTION THAT (A) </p><p>PROVIDING ROOFING FOR IT WILL BE QUITE EXPENSIVE, AND </p><p>(B) BUILDING 500 SUCH HOUSES IS AN EXTREMELY AMBITOUS </p><p>PROJECT WHICH MIGHT EASILY SURPASS THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>RESOURCES BEFORE MANY </p><p>ARE BUILT AND FOR WHICH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FIND ANY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONTRIBUTOR/PARTNER.  END </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THOUGH FOOD AND NON-FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS IN BOTH KANO AND </p><p>JIGAWA STATES ARE NO DOUBT SHORT OF BEING COMPLETELY </p><p>ADEQUATE, AND THOUGH THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY </p><p>WILL CONTINUE IN A DEPENDABLY RELIABLE MANNER, THESE </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT AND ANYONE WORKING TO </p><p>PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE MUST BE CAREFUL TO </p><p>COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS </p><p>TO AVOID DUPLICATION, SO AS NOT TO PROVIDE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH AN EXCUSE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE </p><p>RELIEF/REHABILITATION EFFORTS.  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS NOW PARTICIPATING IN THE RELIEF EFFORT, HAVING TWICE </p><p>SENT EVALUATION TEAMS FROM THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY </p><p>MANAGEMENT AGENCY (NEMA) AND PROVIDING KANO STATE WITH </p><p>$300,000 FOR RELIEF EFFORTS.  (THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AID TO JIGAWA WAS NOT CONFIRMED, BUT IS </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THAT PROVIDED TO KANO.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. IN ADDITION, JIGAWA JUST RECEIVED #100,000 BRITISH </p><p>POUND, FROM DFID OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT (JIGAWA </p><p>HAVING BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A DFID +FOCUS; STATE WELL </p><p>BEFORE THE PRESENT CRISIS.)  THOUGH JIGAWA IS LESS </p><p>POPULATED THAN KANO, FLOOD DAMAGE ON THE WHOLE APPEARS </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN WORSE THERE, WITH MORE HOMES AND FIELDS </p><p>LOST THAN IN KANO, AND MORE AREAS STILL UNDER WATER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. BOTH STATE GOVERNMENTS WERE ABLE TO SECURE A LIMITED </p><p>AMOUNT OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES FROM UNICEF, AND LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AREAS HAVE ALSO RECEIVED ASSISTANCE FROM </p><p>LOCAL BUSINESSMEN.  THE NIGERIAN RED CROSS PROVIDED </p><p>SOME SMALL DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO BENEFICIARIES USING </p><p>BOTH THEIR OWN RESOURCES AND FEDERATION FUNDING ($5000 </p><p>TO DATE.)  USAID EXPENDED $1000 OF THE $25,000 DISASTER </p><p>GRANT ON SOME RELIEF MATERIALS AND HAS TURNED OVER THE </p><p>REMAINING $24,000 VIA A GRANT TO THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FEDERATION OF RED CROSS AND RED CRESCENT SOCIETIES.  NO </p><p>OTHER EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE HAS YET BEEN FORTHCOMING, AND </p><p>NO INTERNATIONAL RELIEF AGENCIES HAVE SET UP IN THE </p><p>AREA.  A DELEGATION FROM THE JAPANESE EMBASSY ARRIVED </p><p>IN KANO ONE DAY AFTER THE OFDA REPRESENTATIVE FOR AN </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATIOM, BUT THEIR ASSISTANCE </p><p>PLANS, IF ANY, ARE NOT YET KNOWN.  DFID JOINED OFDA IN </p><p>THE HELICOPTER FLYOVER ON SEPTEMBER 20TH, AND HAS, AS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, JUST MADE #100,000 AVAILABLE TO </p><p>JIGAWA STATE GOVERNMENT FOR DISASTER RELIEF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  PART OF THE PROBLEM IN THE NIGERIAN CONTEXT, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH, WOULD APPEAR TO BE THAT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING UN AGENCIES, ARE NOT </p><p>HIGHLY PRESENT IN THE COUNTRY. ICRC HAS A VERY SMALL </p><p>OFFICE IN LAGOS.  UNDP AND UNICEF HAVE OFFICES IN KANO, </p><p>BUT THESE OFFICES ARE SMALL.  (THE OFDA REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT BOTH ORGANIZATIONS IN KANO, BUT </p><p>THEY APPEAR TO BE ONE-MAN OFFICES AND THE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES WERE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE SHORT TIME </p><p>FRAME OF THE VISIT.)  THOUGH OTHER LARGE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>NGOS MAY HAVE OFFICES IN LAGOS AND PROGRAMS IN SOUTHERN </p><p>AREAS, NONE APPEAR TO HAVE ANY PRESENCE AT ALL IN THE </p><p>FLOOD-AFFECTED PARTS OF THE COUNTRY-NO ONE APPEARED TO </p><p>HAVE EVEN HEARD OF MOST OF THEM-AND NONE HAVE COME TO </p><p>DO ASSESMENTS OF THE RECENT DISASTER.  BEING AN AREA OF </p><p>INTENSE AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY, IT IS CLEARLY NOT </p><p>NORMALLY A DEFICIT AREA IN TERMS OF FOOD SECURITY, </p><p>WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN THE LACK OF A WFP PRESENCE AND ANY </p><p>FFP SUPPORT. END OF COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>PRESENT NEEDS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. IN GENERAL, THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, </p><p>AND PARTICULARLY THE LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, HAVE </p><p>RESPONDED ADMIRABLY TO MANY OF THE URGENT NEEDS OF THE </p><p>FLOOD VICTIMS.  GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE WAS THE FIRST TO </p><p>ARRIVE, AND REMAINS, BY FAR, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO DATE.  THE CONCERN IS NOT THAT THERE ARE </p><p>SERIOUS GAPS IN THE ASSISTANCE-(RELATIVELY FEW OF THE </p><p>VICTIMS MET DURING THE ASSESSMENT COMPLAINED ABOUT THE </p><p>QUANTITY OR QUALITY OF THE RESPONSE)-BUT THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP REGULAR </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND COMPLETE AMBITIOUS PROGRAMS THAT IT HAS </p><p>INITIATED OR PROMISED.  THERE ARE ALREADY SIGNS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN JIGAWA STATE, THAT GOVERNMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE WILL WANE OVER TIME, AND THAT MORE EXTERNAL </p><p>RESPONSES WILL BE NEEDED.  FURTHERMORE, IT WILL BE </p><p>NECESSARY TO FINE-TUNE THE ASSISTANCE, WITH ASSISTANCE </p><p>PROVIDERS, NOW PROCEEDING TO EVALUATE CAREFULLY ON A </p><p>FAMILY-BY-FAMILY BASIS, AS THE FLOOD WATERS RECEDE, THE </p><p>EXACT EXTENT OF THE AFFECTED POPULATION  LOSSES AND </p><p>THEIR MINIMUM SHORT AND LONG-TERM NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  ADDITIONAL TEMPORARY SHELTER APPEARS NOT TO BE A </p><p>CONCERN.  SEVERAL THOUSAND HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY </p><p>THE FLOOD, AND A FEW VILLAGES ARE STILL UNDER WATER. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THE + DISPLACED PERSONS/FAMILIES ; </p><p>SITUATION WOULD SEEM TO BE UNDER CONTROL.  NO </p><p>POPULATIONS APPEAR TO BE COMPLETELY SHELTER-LESS AT THE </p><p>PRESENT TIME, THE GOVERNMENT HAVING ASSIGNED SCHOOLS </p><p>AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS, OR RENTED PRIVATE </p><p>BUILDINGS, TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO </p><p>MOVE IN WITH RELATIVES OR FRIENDS IN NON-AFFECTED </p><p>HOUSES OR AREAS.  THE NUMBERS ARE NOT THAT HIGH, IN ANY </p><p>CASE, AND MANY WHO WERE ORIGINALLY CAMPING IN GROUP </p><p>SHELTER AREAS HAVE SINCE MOVED OUT, PREFERING TO EITHER </p><p>STAY WITH FRIENDS AND RELATIVES, OR TO MOVE TO RENTED </p><p>HOUSING IN TOWNS, OR TO RETURN TO IMPROVISED HOUSING </p><p>BACK IN THEIR HOME VILLAGES (FOR THOSE CASES WHERE THE </p><p>WATER HAS ALREADY RECEDED). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AS THE GROUP SHELTER AREAS ARE NOT FAR FROM THE </p><p>DISPLACED HOME VILLAGES, AND IN MANY CASES + BELONG ; </p><p>IN SOME SENSE ANYWAY TO THE COMMUNITIES AFFECTED, THE </p><p>ARRANGEMENT HAS CAUSED SO FAR MINIMAL DISRUPTION. </p><p>SCHOOL HAS BEEN SUSPENDED IN SOME AREAS DUE TO </p><p>OCCUPATION OF THE BUILDING BY THE DISPLACED, BUT IT IS </p><p>LIKELY THAT A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WILL BE SOON </p><p>IMPROVISED.  (IN SOME SCHOOLS HOUSING THE DISPLACED, </p><p>SOME CLASSROOMS HAVE BEEN KEPT CLEAR FOR SCHOOL USE AND </p><p>THE SHORTAGE OF SPACE COMPENSATED FOR BY A MOVE TO A </p><p>TWO-SHIFT SYSTEM.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOCIAL PROBLEMS MIGHT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE IF THE </p><p>DISPLACED REMAIN IN THE BUILDINGS FOR MORE THAN A FEW </p><p>MONTHS, WHICH IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THESE PEOPLE </p><p>BE ASSISTED SOON TO DECIDE UPON RECONSTRUCTION SITES </p><p>AND PROVIDED MATERIALS TO USE IN RECONSTRUCTION.  THERE </p><p>IS NO DESIRE TO REMAIN IN GROUP SHELTERS.  UNLESS THERE </p><p>IS MORE HEAVY RAIN (WHICH HAS NOT BEEN TRUE SINCE </p><p>AUGUST), ALL THE VILLAGES FROM WHICH THE DISPLACED CAME </p><p>WILL PROBABLY BE COMPLETELY ACCESSIBLE IN TWO OR THREE </p><p>WEEKS TIME, OPENING THE POSSIBILITY OF RETURN, </p><p>ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHOSE HOUSES WERE CONSTRUCTED OF </p><p>CONCRETE BLOCK AND ARE THUS PROBABLY RECOVERABLE. </p><p>THOUGH MANY ARE SAYING THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO RETURN </p><p>TO THE SAME VILLAGES, FEARING THAT NEXT YEAR THE SAME </p><p>THING COULD HAPPEN AGAIN, IN AREAS WHERE THE WATER HAS </p><p>RECEDED, MANY CLEARLY ALREADY HAVE RETURNED.  WHAT </p><p>COULD KEEP PEOPLE IN GROUP SHELTER AREAS LONGER THAN IS </p><p>ADVISABLE IS THE GOVERNMENT  STATED PROMISE TO </p><p>RESETTLE THE DISPLACED TO NEW SITES ON HIGHER GROUND, </p><p>WHICH MAY NOT BE ACTED UPON QUICKLY.  IN SOME CASES THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A NEW SITE </p><p>FOR A VILLAGE, THEY MUST WAIT UNTIL THE HARVEST OF </p><p>NOVEMBER-DECEMBER IS OVER, SINCE MOST OF THE AREAS THEY </p><p>MIGHT MOVE TO ARE CURRENTLY PLANTED FIELDS AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE THE LAND FROM PRESENT </p><p>OWNERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN ANY CASE, THERE IS NO REASON AT PRESENT TO MOVE TO </p><p>ANOTHER SHELTER THAT WILL NOT BE A PERMANENT ONE, ONCE </p><p>IT IS DECIDED-BY GOVERNMENT, OR ON A FAMILY BY FAMILY </p><p>BASIS-WHERE THEY SHOULD REBUILD, THESE FAMILIES COULD </p><p>PROBALBY USE SOME PLASTIC SHEETING TO IMPROVISE </p><p>TEMPORARY HOUSING ON THEIR NEW (OR OLD) RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>SITES, AS WELL AS CEMENT, ROOFING WOOD, TIN ROOFING AND </p><p>DOOR-/WINDOW SETS TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION OF NEW HOUSING. </p><p>SINCE MANY OF THESE PEOPLE LIVED IN EXTENDED-FAMILY </p><p>COMPOUNDS WITH MULTIPLE BUILDINGS, IT SHOULD BE </p><p>EMPHASIZED FROM THE START THAT ASSISTANCE CAN NOT </p><p>REPLACE WHAT HAS BEEN LOST, BUT ONLY PROVIDE  PERHAPS </p><p>THE FIRST PERMANENT STRUCTURE OF THE FUTURE COMPOUND </p><p>(EXCEPT, OF COURSE, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT STATE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, OR SOME OTHER DONOR, MAKES AVAILABLE THE </p><p>RESOURCES FOR COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE FLOODED VILLAGES LOST ANY FOOD STOCKS THEY HAD </p><p>AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HARVEST MUCH FROM ANY REMAINING </p><p>VIABLE FIELDS UNTIL LATER NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER OF THIS </p><p>YEAR.  EVEN IN LOCATIONS WHERE RESIDENTS WERE ABLE TO </p><p>KEEP FLOOD WATERS FROM ENTERING THE VILLAGE PROPER, </p><p>MUCH EARLY-HARVEST MILLET INTENDED TO TIE THE </p><p>POPULATION OVER UNTIL THE MAIN HARVEST LATER THIS YEAR </p><p>HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE FIELDS AND THUS HAS BEEN LOST. </p><p>PARTICULARLY WORRISOME IS THAT MOST OF THE CLOSE-TO- </p><p>THE-GROUND PROTEIN CROPS, LIKE BEANS AND BAMBARA SEED, </p><p>AS WELL AS THE INCOME-PRODUCING CROPS, SUCH AS RICE, </p><p>HAVE BEEN LARGELY DESTROYED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REGULAR FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS WILL LIKELY BE NECESSARY </p><p>UNTIL DECEMBER OF 2002-THE NEXT HARVEST.  FOR FAMILIES </p><p>STILL ABLE TO HARVEST CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF MILLET </p><p>AND GUINEA CORN IN DECEMBER OF THIS  YEAR, FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE MAY BE REDUCED AT THAT TIME TO JUST PROTEIN </p><p>AND OTHER NON-STAPLE COMMODITIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. SAFE DRINKING WATER REMAINS A CONCERN FOR ALL. </p><p>THERE HAVE BEEN NO OUTBREAKS OF WATER-BORN DISEASES TO </p><p>DATE, BUT THIS REMAINS AN AREA OF VULNERABILITY. </p><p>THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS CHLORINATED SOME CONTAMINATED </p><p>WELLS, AND DUG SOME NEW WELLS (IN RESETTLEMENT AREAS), </p><p>HEALTH OFFICIALS WILL NEED TO BOTH (A) EXPAND THE </p><p>EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT ALL AFFECTED POPULATIONS HAVE </p><p>ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER, (B) FOLLOW UP ON INITIAL </p><p>INTERVENTIONS, PROVIDING ADDITIONAL CHLORINE AS </p><p>NECESSARY, AND (C) MAKE SURE THAT THE POPULATIONS ARE </p><p>WELL-EDUCATED CONCERNING THE DANGERS OF USING NON- </p><p>TESTED WATER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. A SPECIAL MEDICAL INTERVENTION WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE </p><p>INDICATED AT THIS JUNCTURE, SINCE THERE HAVE BEEN NO </p><p>UNUSUAL MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND SINCE THE AFFECTED </p><p>POPULATIONS, IN GENERAL, HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME </p><p>MEDICAL CARE THAT THEY DID BEFORE THE FLOOD.  SEVERAL </p><p>OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE SPONSORED THE SENDING OUT </p><p>OF SPECIAL + MOBILE CLINIC ; TO TREAT SPECIFICALLY </p><p>THOSE DIRECTLY-AFFECTED BY THE FLOODING.  THIS EFFORT </p><p>SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SITUATION </p><p>WILL REMAIN STABLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. CERTAIN OTHER NON-FOOD ITEMS WOULD BE OF USE, </p><p>THOUGH THESE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE URGENT NEEDS. </p><p>ADDITIONAL CLOTHING FOR FAMILIES WHOSE HOUSES WERE </p><p>FLOODED WOULD NO DOUBT BE MOST WELCOME, FOR EXAMPLE, AS </p><p>WELL AS KITCHEN SETS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LOST WHAT THEY </p><p>HAD.  (FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS HAVE, IN MOST CASES, </p><p>LOANED THE DISPLACED THE MATERIALS NEEDED FOR COOKING, </p><p>BUT INDIVIDUAL KITCHEN SETS WILL PROBALBY BE NEEDED </p><p>WHEN THE DISPLACED LIVING-AND COOKING-IN GROUPS AT THE </p><p>PRESENT TIME RETURN TO FAMILY HOUSING.)  LATER ON </p><p>(AFTER RECONSTRUCTION), SEED AND TOOL DISTRIBUTIONS </p><p>WILL BECOME IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION -  GENERAL </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS AND </p><p>PROVIDING NON-FOOD ASSISTANCE WHERE NECESSARY, THE </p><p>NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO </p><p>MOVE QUICKLY IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING WHERE THE </p><p>AFFECTED POPULATIONS WILL RECONSTRUCT HOUSING AND BEGIN </p><p>PROVIDING MATERIALS TO ENABLE THOSE IN NEED TO BEGIN </p><p>THE RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THOUGH AT THE PRESENT MOMENT VIRTUALLLY EVERYONE IS </p><p>TALKING ABOUT + RESETTLEMENT TO SAFER AREAS ;, THESE </p><p>SENTIMENTS AND INTENTIONS MAY LOSE FORCE OVER TIME AS </p><p>PEOPLE SEE THE FLOOD WATERS RECEDE AND THEIR ORIGINAL </p><p>SITES BECOME ACCESSIBLE AGAIN.  FURTHERMORE, IN </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PLANS THERE REMAINS THE COMPLICATED </p><p>QUESTION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THOSE FAMILIES WHO DID </p><p>NOT LOSE THEIR HOUSES (WHOSE HOUSES WERE MADE OUT OF </p><p>CEMENT BLOCKS, FOR EXAMPLE).  DO THEY ALSO MOVE?  IF </p><p>SO, DOES SOMEONE PROVIDE THEM RECONSTRUCTION SUPPORT AS </p><p>WELL? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE </p><p>AN OVERLY-AMBITIOUS CONCEPT OF RECONSTRUCTION, WHEREIN </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT-OR OTHER DONORS-DO NOT JUST SUPPLY </p><p>MATERIALS FOR A SMALL BASIC PERMANENT DWELLING, BUT </p><p>ACTUALLY BUILD LARGE NEW HOUSES-USING PAID LABOR-FOR </p><p>THE FLOOD AFFECTED POPULATIONS.  SIMPLER-AND QUICKER- </p><p>SOLUTIONS TO RECONSTRUCTION NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AND </p><p>INITIATED, PREFERABLY IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD POSITON ITSELF </p><p>TO MONITOR THE SITUATION CLOSELY, AND TO THE EXTENT </p><p>POSSIBLE, BE READY TO RESPOND-PARTICULARLY WITH FOOD, </p><p>BLANKETS, WATER AND MEDICINE-WHEREVER IT IS CLEAR THAT </p><p>THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT CAN NOT RESPOND IN A TIMELY </p><p>FASHION.  EXTERNAL DONORS AND ACTORS MUST BE EXTREMELY </p><p>CAREFUL TO ONLY COMPLEMENT NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT EFFORTS, </p><p>AND NOT SEEM IN ANY WAY TO BE COMPETING WITH GOVERNMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  CLOSE COORDINATION WITH GOVERNMENT RELIEF </p><p>AGENCIES IS THUS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ACTORS AND DONORS MUST WORK IN THE </p><p>BACKGROUND AND ADOPT A PURELY SUPPORTIVE ROLE.  THOUGH </p><p>THEY NEED NOT CHANNEL THEIR RESOURCES THROUGH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, THEY MUST TAKE CARE AS TO NOT BE </p><p>SEEN TO BE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY OF THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>LEST THE GOVERNMENT PERCEIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>WITHDRAW AND SHIFT PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE DISASTER TO EXTERNAL ACTORS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. BOTH NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY SHOULD VERIFY THAT THERE  HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>EXTENSIVE DAMAGE FURTHER DOWN THE RIVER FROM THE </p><p>ORIGINAL FLOODED AREA.  THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THAT SOME 40 VILLAGES IN YOBE STATE HAVE </p><p>ALSO BEEN AFFECTED, YET LITTLE ATTENTION SEEMS SO FAR </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN PAID TO THIS AREA.  THE SITUATION MUST BE </p><p>CAREFULLY MONITORED UNTIL THE FLOOD PEAK FINALLY MAKES </p><p>ITS WAY TO LAKE CHAD OR CEASES TO BE A PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION  FDA SPECIFIC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL DONORS AND ACTORS AT THIS </p><p>POINT SHOULD BE TO COMPLEMENT-BUT NOT SUPPLANT - </p><p>NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT ASISTANCE WHEREVER THIS APPEARS TO </p><p>BE FALLING SHORT OF THE MINIMUM.  THE USG  $24,000 </p><p>DISASTER GRANT TO THE IFRCS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR </p><p>USG INVOLVEMENT OF THIS SORT IN THE SHORT TERM, SINCE </p><p>NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE IS STILL BEING PROVIDED. </p><p>AS THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN ALL SECTORS- </p><p>SHELTER, HEALTH, WATER, FOOD, AND NON-FOOD NECESSITIES- </p><p>INTERVENTIONS CANNOT YET BE DEFINITIVELY PLANNED ALONG </p><p>SECTORAL LINES.  IFRCS MIGHT, HOWEVER, FIND IT </p><p>PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLED IN WATER AND </p><p>SANITATION EFFORTS, AS IT IS UNCLEAR THAT NIGERIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT AREA HAS BEEN </p><p>UNIFORM AND CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE AFFECTED REGIONS. </p><p>LOCAL PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL FOOD AND NON-FOOD ITEMS </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED, HOWEVER, SHOULD CONDITIONS </p><p>WARRANT IT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. THE INEVITABLE SERIOUS LAPSES IN NIGERIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BECOME MORE READILY </p><p>APPARENT OVER THE NEXT MONTH.  DURING THIS TIME, </p><p>USAID/NIGERIA AND ANY INTERESTED INTERNATIONAL NGOS </p><p>WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNIY TO DETERMINE MORE SPECIFICALLY </p><p>HOW THE GOVERNMENT  EFFORTS MIGHT BEST BE COMPLEMENTED </p><p>AND TO DEVELOP RESPONSE PLANS AND PROPOSALS FOR </p><p>SUBMISSION TO OFDA OR OTHER USG AGENCIES.  MUCH BETTER </p><p>AND DETAILED INFORMATION AS TO SUCH QUESTIONS AS TO </p><p>EXACTLY HOW MANY HOMES WERE DESTROYED AND WHAT </p><p>PERCENTAGE OF FARMERS LOST WHAT PERCENTAGE OF WHICH </p><p>CROPS SHOULD ALSO BE FORTHCOMING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE BOTH </p><p>USAID AND OFDA A CHANCE TO EVALUATE FURTHER THE GRAVITY </p><p>OF THE DISASTER BUT ALSO THE VALUE AND QUALITY OF THE </p><p>RESPONSE BY ANY INTERNATIONAL NGOS WHO BECOME INVOLVED, </p><p>AND THUS PROVIDE USAID AND OFDA CLEAR IDEAS REGARDING </p><p>WHO MIGHT BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE PARTNERS FOR FURTHER </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THIS POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. A POTENTIAL AND VERY USEFUL ROLE FOR USG FUNDING TO </p><p>PLAY IN THE NEAR FUTURE MIGHT WELL BE IN THE </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT, PROVIDING, FOR EXAMPLE, A SET, </p><p>STANDARD AMOUNT OF CEMENT, ROOFING MATERIALS, BRICKS, </p><p>DOORS AND WINDOWS TO EACH FAMILY PROVEN TO HAVE LOST </p><p>ALL PERMANENT HOUSING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. A SECOND POTENTIAL ROLE FOR USG-FUNDED PARTNERS </p><p>COULD WELL BE IN THE WATER-SANITATION DOMAIN, EITHER </p><p>REPAIRING DAMAGED WATER SOURCES IN THE ORIGINAL FLOODED </p><p>VILLAGES OR DIGGING NEW WELLS AT NEW RESETTLEMENT </p><p>SITES, DEPENDING ON THE HABITATION PATTERNS THAT </p><p>DEVELOP AS THE WATERS RECEDE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. CENTRAL TO BOTH OF THE ABOVE POTENTIAL ROLES FOR </p><p>USG-FUNDED PARTNERS WOULD APPEAR TO BE CLOSE </p><p>COORDINATION WITH THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT IN PLANNING </p><p>THE DISASTER RESPONSE, AND PARTICULARLY IN PROMOTING </p><p>THE RAPID DETERMINATION OF WHERE RECONSTRUCTION WILL </p><p>TAKE PLACE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. THERE IS AN INTERESTING POTENTIAL ROLE FOR USG/OFDA </p><p>FUNDING WITH REGARD TO FUTURE FLOOD MITIGATION.  THOUGH </p><p>IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT THE FLOOD RESULTED FROM SOME </p><p>EXTRAORDINARILY HEAVY RAINS IN CLOSE SUCCESSION DURING </p><p>THE MONTH OF AUGUST, NO TECHNICAL STUDY HAS YET BEEN </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE WHAT, IF ANYTHING, COULD HAVE </p><p>BEEN DONE BEFORE OR DURING THE RAINS TO MITIGATE THE </p><p>EFFECTS.  COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE WATER IN THE </p><p>RESERVOIRS BEEN RELEASED IN SMALL QUANTITIES TO PREVENT </p><p>THE WATER COMING OVER THE TOP ALL OF A SUDDEN CREATING </p><p>A FLASH-FLOOD SITUATION AS OPPOSED TO A GRADUAL ONE? </p><p>THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WOULD NOT BE TO ASSIGN FAULT, </p><p>BUT GIVEN THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVER THAT THIS </p><p>EXACTLY HAS HAPPENED-THE FIRST MAJOY FLOOD SINCE THE </p><p>DAMS WERE CONSTRUCTED-AND THAT IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO </p><p>SIMPLY GIVE UP FARMING THIS LARGE AREA OF FERTILE LAND </p><p>JUST BECAUSE THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THAT SOME YEAR IN </p><p>THE FUTURE IT MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN, IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO </p><p>NOW STUDY IN DETAIL THE CAUSES AND POSSIBLE MEANS OF </p><p>PREVENTING A REOCCURENCE SHOULD NEXT YEAR, OR THE YEAR </p><p>AFTER, THERE ONCE AGAIN BE HEAVY RAINS.  RIGHT NOW, THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING THEY WANT EVERYONE TO AT LEAST </p><p>MOVE TO THEIR RESIDENCES TO NEW LOCATIONS, AND MUCH OF </p><p>THE POPULATION, STILL TRAUMATIZED, HAS AGREED TO MOVE. </p><p> IF, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT WILL AT SOME POINT GET </p><p>INTO A SITUATION WHERE IT MUST CONVINCE PEOPLE TO MOVE </p><p>TO HIGHER GROUND, THE DISCUSSION WILL BE MORE </p><p>PRODUCTIVE IT IS BETTER INFORMED, I.E. IF EXPERTS HAVE </p><p>LOOKED AT THE SITUATION AND DETERMINED THE DEGREE TO </p><p>WHICH A REOCCURENCE WOULD BE PREVENTABLE, GIVEN THE NEW </p><p>DISCOVERY THAT THIS IS A DANGER TO ALWAYS BE ON THE </p><p>LOOKOUT FOR. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
