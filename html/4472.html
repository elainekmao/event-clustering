<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 008569 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/20/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S SOUTHEAST: BETTER, BUT STILL BACKWARD AS </p><p>GOT PREPARES TO LIFT STATE OF EMERGENCY </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8447 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The GOT is expected to complete the phased </p><p>lifting of the state of emergency November 30 by allowing the </p><p>regime to expire in the last two southeastern provinces where </p><p>it continues -- Diyarbakir and Sirnak.  While the regime\'s </p><p>demise is welcome, five longstanding problems will continue </p><p>to plague the region: underdevelopment, the village guards, </p><p>traditional tribal structures, political alienation, and </p><p>displaced persons.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Based on a five-province survey by Embassy Human </p><p>Rights Officer, tensions in the southeast are down </p><p>significantly from years past, but residents are concerned </p><p>about longstanding impediments to the region\'s economic and </p><p>social development.  This cable, which builds on reftel </p><p>report from Consulate Adana, is based on November 12-16 </p><p>interviews with human rights activists, security officials, </p><p>mayors, sub-governors, attorneys, and religious leaders in </p><p>Diyarbakir, Batman, Siirt, Sirnak, and Mardin provinces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Conditions in the southeast have improved greatly over </p><p>the past three years, following the capture of PKK leader </p><p>Abdullah Ocalan and the virtual end of armed clashes between </p><p>PKK terrorists and security forces.  For example, at the </p><p>security checkpoint outside the town of Eruh, Siirt Province, </p><p>police today check IDs and keep a record of travelers.  In </p><p>years past, according to Eruh Mayor Hamit Nas, police used to </p><p>thoroughly search all vehicles and passengers, and enforce </p><p>strict quotas on transported goods, a process that lasted 1-2 </p><p>hours.  Today, relations between the elected mayor and the </p><p>Ankara-appointed provincial governor and sub-governor are </p><p>good, Nas said.  The sub-governor operates a restaurant </p><p>providing free food to 120 families, and has organized a </p><p>soccer team that includes both members of the security forces </p><p>and local residents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Still, Nas said, economic conditions have not improved </p><p>much since the GOT lifted the state of emergency in Siirt in </p><p>November 1999, and very few residents forced from their homes </p><p>during the height of the conflict have been able to return. </p><p>Eruh provides a reminder that eliminating the state of </p><p>emergency will have limited effect unless followed up with </p><p>other measures.  By completing the phasing out of the regime, </p><p>the GOT will be shutting down the state of emergency region </p><p>Governor\'s Office and eliminating special powers of search, </p><p>detention and interrogation given to security officials in </p><p>state of emergency provinces.  However, our contacts identify </p><p>five obstacles that will continue to block progress. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>OBSTACLE 1: UNDERDEVELOPMENT </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The region has suffered from official neglect dating </p><p>back to the founding of the republic, long before the </p><p>emergence of the PKK and the establishment of the state of </p><p>emergency.  The GOT has focused on controlling, rather than </p><p>developing, the region, out of fear that the mostly Kurdish </p><p>population would separate from Turkey.  Mayors and human </p><p>rights activists cite illiteracy as a major problem, and say </p><p>the education system in the region has always lagged behind </p><p>the rest of the country.  They also say the GOT has recently </p><p>begun restricting fuel trade across the Habur gate on the </p><p>Iraqi border, shutting off an important source of income. </p><p>Seyhmus Diken, advisor to the Diyarbakir mayor, said the </p><p>region is unable to reap benefits from its natural resources </p><p>-- including agricultural and mineral wealth -- because of </p><p>Turkey\'s centrally controlled economy.  The GAP dam project </p><p>is expected to provide irrigation, but has not made a </p><p>significant impact to date.  Diken said a history of conflict </p><p>and lack of GOT support also prevent the southeast from </p><p>drawing tourists by exploiting its historic riches, ranging </p><p>from the ancient walls of Diyarbakir to the Syriac Christian </p><p>monasteries of Mardin.  The city of Diyarbakir, fed up with </p><p>attempts to gain support from Ankara, is currently restoring </p><p>the city walls on its own.  Diken said GOT officials have so </p><p>little regard for local governments in the southeast that one </p><p>Ankara bureaucrat refused to believe that Diyarbakir was nine </p><p>months away from completing the wall project, and asked for a </p><p>photograph. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>OBSTACLE 2: THE VILLAGE GUARD </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Human rights activists and local elected officials </p><p>universally condemn the village guards as a menace.  The GOT </p><p>formed and armed the village guards, who number about 65,000 </p><p>in the southeast, as part of its campaign against the PKK. </p><p>They are widely regarded as undisciplined and dangerous, and </p><p>have repeatedly been accused of murder, beating, rape, </p><p>corruption, drug trafficking, and other abuses.  Critics of </p><p>the force say village guards across the region are living in </p><p>the homes, and farming the land, of displaced residents, and </p><p>will continue to block the return of residents forced out </p><p>during the PKK conflict.  Security officials and </p><p>sub-governors admit the guards are a problem, and say they </p><p>are no longer needed to fight terrorists.  But they argue </p><p>that the guards served their country in the fight against the </p><p>PKK and the GOT has no choice but to phase them out slowly. </p><p>"If we fire them, they will be an even bigger problem," said </p><p>Ugur Bulut, Sirnak deputy governor for security matters. </p><p>Hakki Uzun, state of emergency region deputy governor, said </p><p>the GOT will not hire any new guards and will gradually close </p><p>down the force as its members resign or retire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>OBSTACLE 3: TRIBAL STRUCTURE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Traditional tribal/feudal structures, though fading, </p><p>continue in the region.  Security officials cite this as a </p><p>major challenge.  Ali Tatli, Batman deputy security director, </p><p>said conservative Kurdish families choose to solve problems </p><p>on their own, rather than go to the police.  This, he said, </p><p>explains the continued problem of "honor killings" -- the </p><p>murder by immediate family members of women suspected of </p><p>being unchaste.  Mayors and human rights activists agree, but </p><p>say the GOT exploits these ancient traditions to maintain </p><p>control.  They accuse the government of providing political </p><p>and financial support to selected tribal leaders (agas), many </p><p>of whom are given positions in the village guards.  Tribal </p><p>leaders exercise tight control over thousands of uneducated </p><p>followers, who work their land and vote according to their </p><p>instructions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>OBSTACLE 4: POLITICAL ALIENATION </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The pro-Kurdish DEHAP (formerly HADEP) party won a </p><p>landslide victory in the southeast in the November 3 </p><p>elections, but, as in the past, failed to pass the threshold </p><p>of 10 percent of the national vote required to enter </p><p>parliament.  Though DEHAP officials say harassment of the </p><p>party has decreased, government officials still regularly </p><p>raid DEHAP offices and detain party members.  As a result, </p><p>people in the region have no faith in the democratic process, </p><p>contacts agreed.  To make matters worse, two independent </p><p>candidates elected to parliament from the region were </p><p>nominated by the village guards, according to human rights </p><p>activists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>OBSTACLE 5: RETURNS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The GOT estimates that 378,000 people were displaced </p><p>from the southeast between 1984 and 1999 due to the conflict; </p><p>human rights organizations put the number at more than one </p><p>million.  The GOT claims that 51,000 displaced residents have </p><p>returned.  Turkish and international human rights </p><p>organizations have consistently criticized the GOT\'s returns </p><p>program as inadequate and secretive.  Provincial officials </p><p>say they are doing their best to assist returns.  Bulut said </p><p>Sirnak officials have approved about half the return </p><p>applications of displaced residents.  The other half, he </p><p>said, were turned down because their villages lack essential </p><p>services -- such as water, power, or roads -- or because </p><p>their homes are in areas that remain unsafe.  Rejected </p><p>applications will be reviewed again as conditions improve. </p><p>But local representatives of the Human Rights Association and </p><p>the Immigrants Association for Social Cooperation and Culture </p><p>claim the GOT opposes large-scale returns, and that most </p><p>returnees have received little or no GOT support.  They say </p><p>displaced villagers cannot receive permission to return </p><p>unless they sign a document stating that they fled their </p><p>homes because of actions taken by the PKK, not the GOT, and </p><p>that they will not seek GOT assistance for their return. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The measures utilized by the GOT to fight separatism </p><p>and terrorism in the southeast have also contributed to the </p><p>region\'s backwardness.  The virtual end of the PKK conflict </p><p>provides an opportunity for the GOT to chart a new course and </p><p>begin to close the gap between the southeast and the rest of </p><p>the country, a process one sub-governor said could take </p><p>decades.  This would require considerable funding combined </p><p>with a little imagination and common sense; for example, the </p><p>village guards could be re-trained and assigned to tasks more </p><p>suitable for present conditions.  Unfortunately, it appears </p><p>that GOT officials have not yet adopted a "post war" strategy </p><p>for the region. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
