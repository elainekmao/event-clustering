(C)  Summary:  An active Canadian Public Security </p><p>Anti-terrorism Unit investigation has revealed that an </p><p>organized group of Pakistani males in Canada and Pakistan are </p><p>presenting academic documentation purporting to be issued by </p><p>the Ottawa Business College.  This school exists in name only </p><p>with the sole intent of enabling foreign nationals to obtain </p><p>study permits for applications for Permanent Residence in </p><p>Canada. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The Pakistani males have generally been in the 20-30 </p><p>year old age group.  They list the Ottawa Business College </p><p>with an address of 1825 Markham Road, Scarborough, Ontario </p><p>M1B 4Z9.  It should also be noted that this school has used </p><p>the name Kingston College.  There is a legitimate school that </p><p>is also named Kingston College Inc. located at 2286 Holdom, </p><p>Burnaby, British Columbia V5B 4Y5. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  A trend has emerged that individuals associated with </p><p>the Ottawa Business College in Ontario will obtain study </p><p>permits and then make Convention Refugee claims by making </p><p>slight variations to their names and dates of birth. </p><p>Consequently, these individuals will maintain two identities </p><p>in Canada allowing them to travel internationally while their </p><p>refugee claims are processed. </p><p> </p><p>4.
