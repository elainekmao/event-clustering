<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ALEXANDRIA 00290 </p><p> </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD HOWELL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, ECON, PINR, SOCI, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: ISLAMIC TRILOGY, PART I:  AN OVERVIEW OF </p><p>         THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ALEXANDRIA 00289 </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>ALEXANDRIA\'S RADICAL PAST... </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>2.  PERHAPS IN KEEPING WITH ITS REPUTATION AS A </p><p>CENTER OF DISSENT, IN THE 1970\'S, ISLAMIC RIGHT </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN ALEXANDRIA WERE FOCUSED ON THE </p><p>POLITICAL:  THE RADICAL "SHIBAB MUHAMMAD" </p><p>ORGANIZATION, WHICH TRIED TO OVERTHROW SADAT </p><p>IN 1974, AND THE FIRST RENDITION OF "AL-JIHAD" </p><p>WHICH WAS ACTIVE IN 1979-81, DREW MANY OF THEIR </p><p>LEADERS AND ADHERENTS FROM ALEXANDRIA AND LARGE </p><p>DELTA TOWNS--IN CONTRAST TO "AL-TAKFIR W\'AL-HIJRA" </p><p>AND LATER RADICAL ORGANIZATIONS WHICH WERE ORGANIZED </p><p>AND FOCUSED ON CAIRO AND UPPER EGYPT.  MORE VISIBLY, </p><p>TWO ALEXANDRIA-BASED RELIGIOUS LEADERS, SHAYKHS </p><p>MAHALLAWI AND EID, GALVANIZED A LARGE, VOCAL, AND </p><p>YOUTHFUL FOLLOWING BETWEEN 1977-81 THROUGH THEIR </p><p>POLEMICS (ALBEIT NON-VIOLENT) AGAINST SADAT </p><p>AND CAMP DAVID AND THEIR EXHORTATIONS IN FAVOR OF </p><p>AN ISLAMIC-STYLE REPUBLIC. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>... AND LOWER PROFILE PRESENT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>3.  THE SITUATION IN ALEXANDRIA IS CONSIDERABLY </p><p>DIFFERENT IN 1987.  IN CONTRAST TO THE DAYS WHEN </p><p>MAHALLAWI AND EID WERE IMPORTANT FIGURES ON THE </p><p>NATIONAL POLITICAL SCENE, NO CURRENT LOCAL FIGURE </p><p>CAN BE SAID AT PRESENT TO HAVE SUCH AN INFLUENCE </p><p>OR A FOLLOWING.  EXTREMIST ISLAMIC ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>SUPPORTING VIOLENCE PROBABLY HAVE ADHERENTS, BUT </p><p>THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ALEXANDRIA IS A PARTICULAR </p><p>CENTER FOR THESE GROUPS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>4.  HOWEVER, RADICAL (BUT NON-VIOLENT) ISLAMIC </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS (AND ESPECIALLY THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </p><p>AND THE VARIOUS ISLAMIC GROUPS OR "GAMAAT") </p><p>RETAIN UNTESTED BUT CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL CLOUT. </p><p>THIS IS BEST EVIDENCED BY THE LATTER\'S SUCCESS IN </p><p>RECENT UNIVERSITY STUDENT UNION ELECTIONS (86 </p><p>ALEXANDRIA 1341) AND THE CAREFUL AND SUCCESSFUL </p><p>ORCHESTRATION OF THE MASS PUBLIC PRAYER SERVICES </p><p>IN ALEXANDRIA BY SUPPORTERS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>AT THE END OF RAMADAN AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE </p><p>FEAST OF SACRIFICE (86 ALEXANDRIA 899).  IN </p><p>THIS SENSE, THE ISLAMIC RIGHT\'S LOWER POLITICAL </p><p>PROFILE IN ALEXANDRIA COULD BE MISLEADING.  WHILE </p><p>THERE ARE DOUBTLESS MANY DIVISONS BETWEEN VARIOUS </p><p>FACTIONS, THERE ARE ALSO SUGGESTIONS THAT THE </p><p>ISLAMIC RIGHT, HOWEVER AMORPHOUS, IS BETTER </p><p>ORGANIZED, DISCIPLINED, AND FINANCED THAN SOME </p><p>OBSERVERS SUGGEST.  THE BIG QUESTION MARK IS </p><p>THE EXTENT TO WHICH VARIOUS GROUPS IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p>HAVE LINKAGES AMONG THEMSELVES OR WITH NATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE SEMI-LEGAL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD. </p><p>THIS ISSUE WILL BE ADDRESSED IN PART II. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IN-ROADS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>5.  WHERE THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IS MORE READILY HAVING </p><p>ITS INFLUENCE FELT (AND RAPID GROWTH OBSERVED) IS </p><p>IN COMMERCE, SOCIAL AND WELFARE ACTIVITIES, AND </p><p>PHILANTHROPY.  FOR THE TIME BEING, THIS HAS NOT </p><p>TRANSLATED INTO ANY DIRECT POLITICAL SPOILS, BUT </p><p>THE IMPACT OF ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS IN THESE AREAS HAS </p><p>BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE LOCAL SCENE.  WHILE </p><p>IT MUST BE CONCEDED THAT SOME PEOPLE AFFILIATE </p><p>THEMSELVES WITH SUCH ORGANIZATIONS OR ACTIVITIES </p><p>BECAUSE IT IS CHIC TO DO SO, IT IS NEVERTHELESS </p><p>EQUALLY TRUE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ARE INCREASING THEIR SHARE OF THE </p><p>LOCAL WEALTH, CREATING JOBS IN AN OTHERWISE </p><p>STAGNANT ECONOMY, AND RESPONDING TO SOCIAL NEEDS </p><p>THAT AN OTHERWISE OVERBURDENED CITY GOVERNMENT </p><p>CANNOT PROVIDE. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>6.  THIS THREE PART REPORT PROVIDES A FIRST TENTATIVE </p><p>MICROSCOPIC VIEW OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA: </p><p>ITS LEADERS, ITS ACTIVITIES, AND ITS IMPACT. </p><p>SOME OF THE PERSONALITIES HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN </p><p>EARLIER REPORTING; OTHERS HAVE NOT BEEN AND ARE </p><p>STILL RELATIVELY UNKNOWN TO US.  VARIOUS OBSERVERS </p><p>ASSESS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS:  SOME ARE GENUINELY </p><p>SCARED, FEARING THAT THESE ACTIVISTS, LOADED WITH </p><p>SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS FUNDS, WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT (AND NEGATIVE) POLITICAL IMPACT ON </p><p>EGYPT\'S FUTURE.  OTHERS ARE MORE SANGUINE AND ARGUE </p><p>THAT THE UPSURGE IN ISLAMIC ACTIVISM IS MERELY REFLECTIVE </p><p>OF POPULAR OPINION IN FAVOR OF INCREASED RELIGIOSITY. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>7.  BOTH OF THESE VIEWPOINTS ARE HEARD FREQUENTLY </p><p>IN ALEXANDRIA.  OUR ASSESSMENT IS THAT THERE ARE </p><p>INDEED POSITIVE ASPECTS TO THE CURRENT ACTIVISM </p><p>OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA:  IN A CITY WHERE </p><p>THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS AND LITTLE PROSPECT FOR </p><p>EARLY IMPROVEMENT, THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, NOT INFREQUENTLY, </p><p>IS HELPING TO FILL THE VOID AND, IN THIS MANNER, </p><p>CREATING A MORE STABLE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>8.  AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE TOO MANY UNANSWERED </p><p>QUESTIONS AS TO WHO IS FINANCING VARIOUS ISLAMIC </p><p>ENTERPRISES AND UNDERTAKINGS AND ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS </p><p>BETWEEN VARIOUS ISLAMIC ENTREPRENEURS AND PHILAN- </p><p>THROPISTS AND NATIONAL OR LOCAL ISLAMIC PERSONALITIES </p><p>AND ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE A POLITICAL AGENDA WHICH </p><p>IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE GOE.  UNTIL THESE </p><p>QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED, ONE MUST CONTINUE TO VIEW </p><p>THE ISLAMIC RIGHT AND ITS PROPONENTS WITH CONTINUED </p><p>CAUTION AND CURIOSITY. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>9.  PART II IN THIS SERIES WILL IDENTIFY SOME OF </p><p>THE PRINCIPAL SPIRITUAL AND (POTENTIALLY) POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA.  THE </p><p>THIRD AND FINAL PART WILL LOOK AT REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>OF THE GROWING ISLAMIC BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND </p><p>ASSESS THEIR ROLE IN COMMERCE, SOCIAL WELFARE, </p><p>AND PHILANTHROPIC ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAMBLEY </p><p></p></div>
