DUSTR Huntsman </p><p>reviewed the progress of BTA implementation, urged the GVN </p><p>to consult further with auto industry representatives </p><p>regarding a proposed policy to significantly increase </p><p>tariffs on auto parts, and advised the GVN to provide a </p><p>counterproposal on textile quotas and work to quickly </p><p>conclude textile negotiations.  DUSTR Huntsman pointed out </p><p>that the bilateral relationship needs to have both a </p><p>"problem-solving track" and an "opportunity track" and noted </p><p>that President Bush had clearly defined the opportunity </p><p>track through the Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative (EAI).  In </p><p>their meetings, DPM Vu Khoan, MOT Tuyen and MPI Phuc </p><p>generally hit the right notes on most problems and </p><p>opportunities.  However, the lack of a concrete response </p><p>regarding the proposed increase in auto tariffs remains an </p><p>area of concern, especially given its potential disastrous </p><p>effect on the investment climate.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) During DUSTR Jon Huntsman\'s March meetings with </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Vu Khoan, Minister of Trade </p><p>(MOT) Truong Dinh Tuyen and Minister of Planning and </p><p>Investment, four recurring themes arose: implementation of </p><p>the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), auto </p><p>tariffs, textile negotiations, and the future of Vietnam\'s </p><p>global integration. </p><p> </p><p>BTA IMPLEMENTATION </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) GVN counterparts universally heralded the positive </p><p>development of the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral relationship since </p><p>BTA implementation began, especially pointing to the rise in </p><p>two-way trade.  Exports to the U.S. have more than doubled </p><p>in value over the past year (up 129%), and exports from the </p><p>U.S. to Vietnam are up by almost one-third (up 26%).  MOT </p><p>Tuyen forecast that exports from Vietnam will rise more </p><p>slowly in the future while American exports to Vietnam will </p><p>accelerate.  All three GVN officials pointed out Vietnam\'s </p><p>efforts to meet its BTA commitments, implementing some of </p><p>them, such as insurance, ahead of schedule. (Note: Although </p><p>GVN officials like to claim this, it is in fact not exactly </p><p>true.  They have licensed one U.S. firm ahead of schedule as </p><p>a 100% FIE in the life sector but there are several other </p><p>outstanding requests in both the life and non-life sectors.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) DUSTR Huntsman responded by characterizing the </p><p>U.S.-Vietnam relationship as "fundamentally very good" and </p><p>noting the additional interest in Vietnam brought by the </p><p>BTA.  While acknowledging the GVN\'s progress on </p><p>implementation, DUSTR Huntsman encouraged the GVN to </p><p>continue to focus on outstanding issues, including </p><p>transparency and IPR enforcement.  DPM Vu Khoan, MOT Tuyen </p><p>and MPI Phuc replied by highlighting the GVN\'s various </p><p>efforts on both fronts.  Regarding transparency, DPM Vu </p><p>Khoan pointed to the fact that GVN decrees now do not take </p><p>effect until fifteen days after they have been announced and </p><p>are often launched on the government website.  MOT Tuyen </p><p>noted that laws are made available to the public and are </p><p>often published in the newspapers.  Meanwhile, MPI Phuc </p><p>referred to GVN efforts build the capacity of civil servants </p><p>in order to ensure that they have a good understanding of </p><p>the laws and roadmaps in order to properly enforce them. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) On IPR, DUSTR Huntsman further explained that this </p><p>issue will always be important to our relationship, because </p><p>there are people in the U.S. and Vietnam creating and </p><p>developing new technologies that fuel future growth.  The </p><p>three Vietnamese counterparts acknowledged the significance </p><p>of IPR for the GVN and that the lack of protection could </p><p>hinder Vietnam\'s development.  Furthermore, many Vietnamese </p><p>companies now realize the importance of protecting their own </p><p>trademarks.  The large number of workshops and seminars </p><p>conducted by the USAID-funded Support for Trade AcceleRation </p><p>(STAR) project provide the groundwork for improving </p><p>cooperation on IPR.  The three GVN officials acknowledged </p><p>that the GVN must streamline the activities of the agencies </p><p>responsible for IPR enforcement.  At the same time, DPM Vu </p><p>Khoan attributed some problems in enforcement to </p><p>difficulties in being able to tell if an import is </p><p>counterfeit or not.  MPI Phuc stated that they are doing </p><p>everything they can to fight piracy, but individual problems </p><p>are beyond the GVN\'s control. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) DUSTR Huntsman also raised the problems </p><p>experienced by one U.S. company (McCullagh) with the Dak Lak </p><p>provincial government in its attempts to buy out its joint </p><p>venture partner (Krong Ana).  He explained the necessity of </p><p>ensuring that local governments do not overturn decisions </p><p>made by the central government and urged the Ministry of </p><p>Planning and Investment to do everything possible to resolve </p><p>the situation in an amicable way.  MPI Phuc responded that </p><p>he is aware of the case and has appointed officials who will </p><p>follow and report on it.  DUSTR Huntsman also raised </p><p>concerns about the GVN\'s commitment to enforce arbitral </p><p>awards, specifically citing the ongoing Tyco case (see </p><p>reftel A). MPI Phuc simply responded that he must check into </p><p>the status of the case. </p><p> </p><p>AUTO TARIFFS </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) DUSTR Huntsman raised the issue of a Ministry of </p><p>Finance proposal to significantly raise import duties and </p><p>apply a special consumption tax on the importation of </p><p>automobile kits and cited the issue as an "area of concern" </p><p>(see reftel B for discussion about a similar decree in </p><p>December 2002 that had been temporarily suspended).  The </p><p>GVN\'s inadequate consultation with the industry makes this </p><p>issue even more worrisome.  Using the case of Ford as an </p><p>example, DUSTR Huntsman explained that Ford has invested USD </p><p>72 million in Vietnam.  However, if the new policy is </p><p>implemented, Ford fears that it will be forced out of the </p><p>market.  Before the GVN implements this policy, DUSTR </p><p>Huntsman urged, the industry representatives should have the </p><p>opportunity to sit down with the relevant departments to </p><p>hear the plan and be able to discuss its effect on their </p><p>long term investment plans in Vietnam.  DUSTR Huntsman </p><p>advised that the GVN carefully consider the place of the </p><p>international auto companies in Vietnam\'s market. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The responses from the three Vietnamese officials </p><p>were confusing and disjointed, showing a lack of clear </p><p>comprehension of the true motives behind this proposed </p><p>Decision.  DPM Vu Khoan tried to explain that the GVN\'s </p><p>policy of adjusting tariff rates is designed to suit WTO </p><p>standards.  The GVN needs to reduce the level of protective </p><p>barriers, which are currently very high in Vietnam.  As an </p><p>example, DPM Vu Khoan cited the high level of protection </p><p>currently offered for automobiles produced domestically. </p><p>Consumers pay 100 percent special consumption tax on </p><p>automobiles imported into Vietnam but only 5 percent for </p><p>those produced domestically.  DPM Vu Khoan argued that </p><p>Vietnam needs to reduce the protective barriers as part of </p><p>its negotiations with the WTO.  With respect to consultation </p><p>with the industry, DPM Vu Khoan noted that the Ministry of </p><p>Finance has already met with the automobile producers to </p><p>discuss the issue.  He also stated that he would study the </p><p>letters Ambassador Burghardt and the U.S. automobile </p><p>association had sent him on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) MOT Tuyen acknowledged that the change to the </p><p>tariff schedule was sudden and would have an adverse impact </p><p>on producers.  He argued, however, that it did not violate </p><p>the BTA because there is no binding commitment on auto </p><p>tariff levels.  Auto producers in Vietnam, he claimed, make </p><p>very high profits.  He stated that producers still do not </p><p>produce many auto parts in Vietnam and that Vietnam very </p><p>much wanted to develop an auto industry.  (Note: Tuyen was </p><p>echoing an argument we have heard in many other areas - the </p><p>idea of "too much" or "enough" profit.  GVN officials often </p><p>do not understand or accept the concept of recovery of sunk </p><p>costs and/or return on investment.  We continue to remind </p><p>them that the amount of "profit" is not a GVN concern, and </p><p>in fact, they should be happy since it generates tax </p><p>revenue.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Finally, MPI Phuc responded by explaining that </p><p>this strategy concerned import duties on spare parts and the </p><p>special consumption tax (SCT).  Presently, imported cars are </p><p>taxed at 300 per cent while locally manufactured cars are </p><p>only subject to a 100 per cent tax.  Because importers and </p><p>exporters reject this protectionism, the GVN must reconsider </p><p>the SCT.  Furthermore, the GVN must decrease certain taxes, </p><p>such as the SCT, and impose similar tax rates between </p><p>locally manufactured and imported cars in order to follow </p><p>their commitments to international institutions.  In </p><p>response to this explanation, DUSTR Huntsman again </p><p>underscored the importance of continued consultations with </p><p>investors regarding this issue.  DUSTR Huntsman also pointed </p><p>out Vietnam\'s tariff roadmap should approximate WTO rates </p><p>and not have spikes, as the GVN negotiates to accede to the </p><p>WTO.  In light of this process, Vietnam should, furthermore, </p><p>consider phasing out local content requirements.  MPI Phuc </p><p>replied that he understood this issue and that the GVN </p><p>recently abolished the local content requirement for </p><p>motorcycles. </p><p> </p><p>TEXTILE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) DUSTR Huntsman expressed appreciation that </p><p>Vietnam had offered dates for a second round of textile </p><p>negotiations (the week of April 7), but emphasized that </p><p>Vietnam needs to offer a counterproposal in advance of these </p><p>discussions.  There are buyers and company boards of </p><p>directors who want to know what is coming and need this </p><p>matter settled so that they can make business decisions. </p><p>DUSTR Huntsman also pointed out that the USG waited 14 </p><p>months before beginning negotiations.  He assured his </p><p>counterparts that the U.S. would be fair, but that the U.S. </p><p>and Vietnam must wrap the negotiations up quickly. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Both DPM Vu Khoan and MOT Tuyen affirmed that the </p><p>GVN is ready to negotiate and implement an agreement. </p><p>However, they argued Vietnam needs more time to fulfill the </p><p>"vitality" of the BTA.  Furthermore, the U.S. should </p><p>consider Vietnam\'s overall potential as a producer.  The </p><p>U.S. should not simply look at current export numbers, </p><p>because "sometimes reality is unrealistic."  While the </p><p>increase in Vietnamese textile exports to the U.S. is </p><p>remarkable, the value is still very small compared with the </p><p>huge U.S. market. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) MOT Tuyen noted the large amount of U.S. cotton </p><p>imported by Vietnam.  He stressed the importance of the </p><p>textile and apparel industry to Vietnam, noting that </p><p>textiles account for a significant portion of Vietnam\'s </p><p>export revenue (after stripping out coffee and marine </p><p>products).  Because Vietnam has less agricultural land per </p><p>person than China, Vietnam has undertaken to move many </p><p>redundant farm workers to industrial jobs, such as those </p><p>offered in textile and garment production.  If Vietnam does </p><p>not succeed in this effort, MOT Tuyen claimed that </p><p>additional stresses on the forest and environment would </p><p>occur.  He further emphasized that Vietnam is a growing </p><p>market.  With additional quota, Vietnam would have more </p><p>foreign exchange to purchase U.S. products, such as aircraft </p><p>and other high-tech goods, as well as afford U.S. </p><p>participation in infrastructure projects.  In addition, MOT </p><p>Tuyen said that he did not think that the U.S. wants its </p><p>market full of Chinese products. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) During his discussion on this subject, DPM Vu </p><p>Khoan emphasized that the two sides should work to expand </p><p>their bilateral relations with a long-term vision and on the </p><p>basis of stability.  This concept is crucial for both sides </p><p>and the Southeast Asian region as a whole.  The fact that </p><p>negotiations have begun is a good step, DPM Vu Khoan added. </p><p>Next April when negotiations resume, there will be good </p><p>discussions and the GVN will present its ideas to the U.S. </p><p>side. </p><p> </p><p>WTO AND BEYOND </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Although it will be important for Vietnam and the </p><p>U.S. to make progress on some of the current difficulties in </p><p>the relationship, such as improving IPR enforcement and </p><p>finishing textile negotiations in April, DUSTR Huntsman </p><p>emphasized that both sides should also focus on the long- </p><p>term relationship.  This goal fits with President Bush\'s </p><p>vision of the Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative (EAI), which </p><p>recognizes the importance of ASEAN and ensures that the two </p><p>sides grow and develop together through increased trade </p><p>links.  The U.S. wants to help Vietnam join the WTO, then </p><p>perhaps negotiate a Trade Investment Framework Agreement </p><p>(TIFA), and finally undertake a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). </p><p>DUSTR Huntsman noted that the USG will participate in the </p><p>WTO working party on Vietnam\'s accession that is tentatively </p><p>planned for May in Geneva.  The GVN must take advantage of </p><p>this preparatory stage, DUSTR Huntsman advised.  There are </p><p>several areas in which Vietnam can begin preparing for </p><p>membership today by putting the right rules on the books. </p><p>BTA implementation will also help prepare Vietnam for WTO </p><p>accession. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) DPM Vu Khoan noted that the GVN is looking </p><p>forward to the sixth working party.  Although a number of </p><p>countries have indicated an interest in having bilateral </p><p>negotiations with Vietnam, Vietnam has only held these talks </p><p>with a limited number of countries, including the EU and New </p><p>Zealand.  The GVN is, therefore, looking forward to the </p><p>opportunity to assess its partners\' sentiments during the </p><p>working party.  DPM Vu Khoan agreed that Vietnam must use </p><p>its time to prepare for WTO accession.  The National </p><p>Assembly has 117 bills and amended laws on its agenda </p><p>through 2005.  The National Assembly is also in the process </p><p>of reforming the process of law making, which should help </p><p>accelerate the reform process. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) MOT Tuyen welcomed the EAI as well as possible </p><p>technical assistance WTO issues.  However, practical </p><p>implementation remains an issue.  MOT Tuyen stressed his </p><p>personal view that the U.S. should not seek to negotiate </p><p>separate agreements with individual ASEAN member states, but </p><p>should try to negotiate with ASEAN as a group.  As most </p><p>tariff rates among ASEAN countries drop to between zero and </p><p>five percent in 2006, the trend should be to work with </p><p>ASEAN.  DUSTR Huntsman reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to </p><p>working more closely with ASEAN and the increasing </p><p>importance of an integrated market.  However, he noted, some </p><p>members are clearly ready to move faster than others. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Throughout DUSTR Huntsman\'s meetings, </p><p>he noted that the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral relationship has </p><p>two tracks - a problem-solving track and an opportunities </p><p>track.  While both sides must work on the "problem-solving </p><p>track" in addressing the wide range of issues, they must </p><p>also pursue the "opportunity track" to build the long-term </p><p>relationship.  In their meetings, DPM Vu Khoan, MOT Tuyen </p><p>and MPI Phuc generally agreed with this approach, hitting </p><p>the right notes on most problems and opportunities. </p><p>However, the lack of an organized, consistent or concrete </p><p>response regarding the proposed increase in auto tariffs </p><p>remains an area of concern, especially given its potential </p><p>disastrous effect on Ford and GM/Daewoo investments and the </p><p>investment climate in general. </p><p> </p><p>19.
