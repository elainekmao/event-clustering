<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001732 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY MARCH 19: ORIGINAL U.S. PACKAGE </p><p>GONE, BUT MARKETS CONTINUE TO HOPE FOR SOME PACKAGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 (b, </p><p>d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Between Extremes of Monday and Tuesday </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Turkish financial markets were in a foul mood at OOB </p><p>March 19, on news reports (see below) that the original U.S. </p><p>financial package had in fact expired, despite GOT public </p><p>statements to the contrary on March 18 during critical T-bill </p><p>auctions.  At market opening, the lira traded at TL 1,740,000 </p><p>to the dollar and T-bill yields dropped to 70 percent. </p><p>Markets improved throughout the morning, on renewed hopes of </p><p>some U.S. financial package still being available, and at </p><p>mid-day: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira was trading at TL 1,685,000 to the dollar </p><p>(depreciating about two percent from yesterday\'s close); </p><p>--  T-bill yields rose to 65 percent (up five percentage </p><p>points from yesterday\'s close); </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange declined 5 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) At OOB March 19, General Manager of Akbank (largest </p><p>holder of GOT marketable debt) Kurtul told us, "Babacan lied </p><p>to us to get through the auctions.  The markets completely </p><p>lack confidence in these people.  They can\'t get things done </p><p>and they don\'t react properly."  But Kurtul also added that </p><p>news of progress with the IMF would be welcome and would </p><p>begin to help restore some market confidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Kocbank acting CEO Kemal Kaya was somewhat less </p><p>pessimistic, partly because his bank no longer has much </p><p>T-bill exposure.  He noted that the Turkish banks (again, not </p><p>his) can continue to comfortably fund T-bill purchases </p><p>through borrowing in the overnight lira markets at current </p><p>rates (overnight rates are 44 percent).  While this creates a </p><p>serious maturity mismatch, the main risks per Kaya is that </p><p>the Central Bank is forced to raise its overnight lending </p><p>rates, to dampen inflationary expectations, or that T-bills </p><p>continue to lose money thus downgrading the amount of </p><p>overnight exposure the banks can afford (overnights use </p><p>T-bills as collateral.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Some Public Statements Interpreted as </p><p>Giving Hope for New U.S. Package </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The main news item at OOB March 19 was not positive </p><p>for those hoping for a U.S. financial package.  It was the </p><p>press statement of GOT spokesman (and Justice Minister) Cemil </p><p>Cicek following the late March 18 Cabinet meeting.  Cicek </p><p>told the press around midnight that the Government had </p><p>decided to submit a new parliamentary resolution on March 19, </p><p>which could be approved by parliament the same day.  But he </p><p>said the new resolution would seek authorizations for two </p><p>elements:  U.S. overflight rights; Turkish troop deployment </p><p>abroad.  (Comment:  Markets expect U.S. troop authorization, </p><p>but not overflight rights, to equal a financial package.) </p><p>Cicek explained the resolution in part as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "The U.S. Government requested that Turkey only open air </p><p>corridors for the transit of U.S. airplanes.  At this stage, </p><p>that\'s all they wanted from us.  Hence, we will only include </p><p>these two aspects in the resolution.  In the negotiations, we </p><p>mutually agreed in principle on the presence of Turkish </p><p>troops in Northern Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Later in morning Turkish TV newcasters and market </p><p>analysts focused on one sentence in the Secretary\'s March 18 </p><p>press interview:  "Now we\'ll wait to see what the Turkish </p><p>Government is able to do and what the parliament is able to </p><p>do and then we can respond to what\'s on the table or not." </p><p>This was interpreted as giving renewed hope that some U.S. </p><p>package was still available.  As chief analyst for Bender </p><p>Securities (the largest stock brokerage for foreign </p><p>investors) told us, "the original package is gone, but all is </p><p>not lost." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  Finally, MinState Babacan gave press comments shortly </p><p>after noon local time that supported the hopeful </p><p>interpretation in the markets.  Babacan was walking into a </p><p>meeting with FM Gul when journalists asked him why he had </p><p>announced on March 18 that the full U.S. package including a </p><p>bridge loan was still available.  Babacan replied:  "The full </p><p>package would have been valid in the case of full military </p><p>cooperation with the U.S.  But developments are changing very </p><p>rapidly.   Depending on developments, there might be a new </p><p>package (from the U.S.)" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
