<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004589 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, XF, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FORMER IRAQI OIL MINISTER SAYS SADDAM IS VULNERABLE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Former Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Chalabi told visiting </p><p>SFRC Staffer Puneet Talwar August 12 that Saddam\'s hold is </p><p>fragile, that most Iraqis believe the U.S. is serious about </p><p>regime change "this time," and that they "want to see Saddam </p><p>gone, preferably while they are asleep."  Saddam will use the </p><p>fear of chaos to try to keep his populace quiet, and the fear </p><p>of mass casualties from potential WMD strikes to keep the </p><p>U.S. from launching operations.  Given heightened regional </p><p>tensions and low U.S. credibility stemming from the ongoing </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict, regime change by covert means </p><p>would be far preferable to a more conventional approach </p><p>requiring a longer, and more visible, U.S. military build-up, </p><p>according to Chalabi. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Turning to "the day after," Chalabi argued that the </p><p>Iraqi army should focus on providing order, that the </p><p>on-the-ground U.S. presence should be minimized, and that a </p><p>provisional government made up of technocrats, not military </p><p>men, should be put in place.  U.S. security guarantees will </p><p>be essential in allaying Iraqi fears of possible future </p><p>Iranian or Turkish ambitions.  Most Iraqis, he stated, </p><p>understand that their future is dependent on good relations </p><p>with the West in general and the U.S. in particular.  Iraq </p><p>could rebuild itself "within five years" by boosting oil </p><p>production to six million barrels per day, along with debt </p><p>and loan forgiveness.   If the U.S. does not act this time, </p><p>Chalabi cautioned, many Iraqis will give up the future once </p><p>and for all, and Saddam will emerge stronger than ever.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Visiting SFRC Staffer Puneet Talwar, accompanied by </p><p>Poloff, met former Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Chalabi August </p><p>12.  Chalabi, who was Oil Minister from March 1987 to October </p><p>1990, has been resident in Amman since 1993.  He currently is </p><p>an oil industry consultant. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>A Fragile Regime Dependent on Fear of Chaos </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Chalabi began by arguing that, behind all the bluster, </p><p>Saddam\'s regime is fragile.  The regime, he said, seeks to </p><p>keep its own populace quiet and loyal, and the U.S. at bay, </p><p>by heightening fears of the chaos and destruction that could </p><p>ensue should military operations commence.  Looking back to </p><p>1991, Chalabi said "he (Saddam) was spreading rumors of </p><p>chaos, rumors that the intelligence services were behind. </p><p>People didn\'t rally around Saddam because they loved him. </p><p>They did so because they were scared."  Although not </p><p>minimizing the potential for Saddam to use WMD against U.S. </p><p>forces, Israel, or his own people, he said that the regime </p><p>will seek to use those fears as a deterrent against threats </p><p>from within or without. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>But Once It Cracks, It will Fall </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) That strategy notwithstanding, Chalabi said he </p><p>believes that once an operation to change the regime begins </p><p>"Saddam will not be there for long.  What you need to do is </p><p>separate Saddam from the people, block his lines of </p><p>communication to the Special Republican Guards, and then </p><p>flood the airwaves with your message.  If the people are </p><p>convinced that Saddam has fled or is cornered, everybody will </p><p>run after themselves.  Iraqis think you are serious now and </p><p>most want to see Saddam go, preferably while they are asleep." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Covert is the Way to Go </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Chalabi offered that a quick, precise, covert action </p><p>would be far preferable to a more conventional military </p><p>approach for a number of reasons.  First, U.S. credibility in </p><p>the region is at a very low point as a result of the ongoing </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict, thus making the pre-positioning </p><p>of large numbers of U.S. troops and material difficult. </p><p>Second, Saddam would, with some success, paint a conventional </p><p>U.S. military assault as "an invasion force, not a liberation </p><p>force."  This would result in greater, and better </p><p>coordinated, Iraqi resistance.  Finally, a large </p><p>on-the-ground U.S. presence "would begin to look like an </p><p>occupying force after a while.  You don\'t want this." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>The First Day After: An Immediate Need for Order and Calm, </p><p>And U.S. Security Guarantees </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In this immediate "day after" environment, it will be </p><p>critical, Chalabi argued, that the Iraqi people be reassured </p><p>that order and calm will prevail and the country will not </p><p>fall into chaos.  The Iraqi Army should focus on this task, </p><p>not overall governance, Chalabi said.  Rather than military </p><p>rule, "a provisional government of technocrats should be </p><p>installed."  (Note: Chalabi declined to identify anyone </p><p>specifically who should be included in such a government, and </p><p>recognized the difficulties of such a task.  In his view "the </p><p>Iraqi opposition outside the country has no real constituency </p><p>and there is no Karzai.  Saddam has gotten rid of anybody who </p><p>even had that potential."  Chalabi also dismissed the notion </p><p>that there is any significant nostalgia for restoration of </p><p>Hashemite rule either.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In addition to internal order, Iraqis will also want </p><p>immediate reassurance that their national sovereignty will be </p><p>protected: "People understand that their future lies with the </p><p>West in general, and the U.S. in particular.  You (i.e. the </p><p>U.S.) don\'t need to be there physically, but they need to </p><p>know that you will support them against Iranian or Turkish </p><p>ambitions." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Iraqis Must Think of Themselves as Iraqis First </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Peering further down the road at a post-Saddam Iraq of </p><p>the future, Chalabi said that "the question of federalism </p><p>needs to be looked at closely."  Five to seven regional </p><p>governments would be feasible, he offered, including one for </p><p>the Kurdish areas.  That said, for the most part these </p><p>divisions should not fall along ethnic lines: "People need to </p><p>think of themselves as Iraqis first."  Future leaders should </p><p>work to include members from all groups in their governments, </p><p>but "somebody should not be hired because he\'s a Kurd or a </p><p>Shiite, or whatever.  To follow the Lebanese model would make </p><p>matters worse and would be a constant source of instability </p><p>for years to come." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Reconstruction: Oil and a Bit of Debt Forgiveness </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Turning to the longer term aspects of Iraqi </p><p>reconstruction, Chalabi struck a very positive chord, </p><p>predicting that, under the proper conditions, the country </p><p>"could rebuild itself in five years."  Iraq, Chalabi said, </p><p>"could go to 6 million barrels per day easily.  I had that </p><p>plan in 1990."  Increased petroleum revenues, along with </p><p>forgiveness of some Iraqi debts and loans, would hasten </p><p>Iraq\'s reintegration into the international community. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>It\'s Now or Never </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) As the meeting drew to a close, Chalabi made clear </p><p>that, in his view, the time had come for the U.S. to rid Iraq </p><p>of Saddam.  If that does not happen, and the U.S. continues </p><p>with a policy of containment, "we will all feel disheartened, </p><p>disenchanted, and that there is no hope for our country. </p><p>People will believe that Saddam really does have some special </p><p>power and that he is here for good. There should be an </p><p>ultimatum from the Security Council about the return of the </p><p>inspectors.  When they go back in, I\'m sure they will find </p><p>things Iraq should not have.  You need to have the support of </p><p>the international community, and you need to deal with this </p><p>problem now, before new (internal) problems arise in Saudi </p><p>Arabia or Kuwait and make the prospect of regime change in </p><p>Iraq even more complicated." </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
