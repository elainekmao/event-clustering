(C) Summary: Prosecutors at the International Criminal </p><p>Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) successfully </p><p>negotiated four plea agreements during the three months that </p><p>ended with the plea of Darko Mrdja on July 24.  According to </p><p>ICTY Chief of Prosecutions Michael Johnson, the plea </p><p>agreements are not one-off affairs but an important part of </p><p>the prosecutors\' efforts to implement the ICTY completion </p><p>strategy.  Johnson also spoke hopefully about implementing a </p><p>"transition strategy" and working with Balkan players to </p><p>transfer cases to national jurisdictions, but emphasized that </p><p>work on "transitioning" has not been at the top of the chief </p><p>prosecutor\'s agenda and has therefore been shortchanged in </p><p>internal planning.  While this approach is just one part of </p><p>the Tribunal\'s efforts, Johnson\'s overview provides insight </p><p>into one way in which the Tribunal will try to implement the </p><p>tight schedule of the completion strategy.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The July 24 guilty plea by Darko Mrdja for his role in </p><p>the Mt. Vlasic massacre in 1992 capped an active three months </p><p>in which three other indictees pled guilty in agreements with </p><p>the ICTY prosecutors.  All four indictees can be </p><p>characterized as below the standard of senior-level </p><p>perpetrators: two mid-level officers involved in the 1995 </p><p>Srebrenica massacres (Nikolic and Obrenovic), a guard at the </p><p>Keraterm camp (Banovic) and a police officer (Mrdja).  At </p><p>least a dozen -- and potentially up to twenty -- indictees at </p><p>the pre-trial or trial stage may be characterized as </p><p>mid-level or lower-level perpetrators of crimes within the </p><p>ICTY\'s jurisdiction.  It is this general group of indictees </p><p>that is targeted by senior prosecutors for plea negotiations. </p><p> They tend to be cases which have relatively narrow crime </p><p>bases, with limited witnesses and limited goals, and they are </p><p>therefore envisioned as "quick" prosecutions that can be </p><p>handled in a few months each.  (Note: Getting witness lists </p><p>reduced, indictments narrowed and prosecution cases shortened </p><p>have been major goals of judicial chambers, and the jury is </p><p>still out on whether the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) is </p><p>succeeding in this regard.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Chief of Prosecutions Michael Johnson explained that </p><p>he and senior prosecutors were engaged in a "marble stacking </p><p>exercise," in which cases are generally ranked in order of </p><p>priority and readiness for a plea negotiation.  Plea </p><p>negotiations have worked most effectively with respect to </p><p>indictees whose trials are scheduled to take place in the </p><p>near term, and Johnson said that he and other senior staff </p><p>have worked with ICTY judicial chambers to "fast track" such </p><p>cases.  (Note: The Mrdja case is a good example: focused on a </p><p>massacre on a particular date in 1992 involving a particular </p><p>perpetrator, the prosecution case was anticipated to last not </p><p>more than a month.  On July 9 a trial date of July 29 was </p><p>scheduled; plea negotiations intensified and an agreement was </p><p>reached on July 24. End note.)  Once an indictee pleads out, </p><p>the next marble/case drops into play, gets scheduled for </p><p>trial, and plea negotiations are sought.  Not all indictees </p><p>are interested, but, in this way, Johnson said that senior </p><p>prosecutors hope not only to clear the docket of cases that </p><p>fall below completion strategy criteria but also encourage </p><p>the mid- and low-level perpetrators to testify against the </p><p>leadership -- a process that, in itself, can help to reduce </p><p>the number of witnesses and resulting time necessary to put </p><p>on prosecution evidence in those big cases.  Johnson argued </p><p>that the Tribunal would get more out of plea agreements than </p><p>it would out of the simple transfer of the same indictees to </p><p>national jurisdictions for trial under Rule 11bis of the </p><p>Tribunal Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Meanwhile, he </p><p>said, it would ease the potential strain on the special war </p><p>crimes chamber envisioned for Sarajevo by reducing the number </p><p>of cases it would have to handle in its early stages. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Johnson suggested that other factors also contribute </p><p>to the plea agreements.  He believes, for instance, that </p><p>consideration of the special war crimes chamber is forcing </p><p>indictees to ask themselves whether they would rather spend </p><p>prison time "in Sweden or Tuzla."  It is partly for this </p><p>reason that Johnson believes that the international community </p><p>should talk of a "transition strategy," which suggests that </p><p>perpetrators will find no safe haven from prosecutions, </p><p>rather than a "completion strategy," which may give the wrong </p><p>impression of a closing-out of files against alleged </p><p>perpetrators.  OTP\'s conviction rate is also impressive, </p><p>making indictees believe that the odds are against them if </p><p>their cases go to trial.  Moreover, it is hoped that the </p><p>recent life sentence imposed on Milomir Stakic (septel) for </p><p>his involvement as a Bosnian Serb civilian leader in the </p><p>Prijedor region in 1992 -- more than the forty-six years </p><p>imposed on the much more senior Bosnian Serb General Krstic </p><p>two years ago -- will concentrate the minds of similarly </p><p>culpable indictees who may believe they are choosing between </p><p>a deal and life in prison.  OTP\'s relatively recent emphasis </p><p>on ensuring that indictments are narrowly-drawn and </p><p>trial-ready should, Johnson hopes, contribute to their </p><p>ability to negotiate plea agreements early in the pre-trial </p><p>schedule. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Johnson tried to make clear that he, Deputy Prosecutor </p><p>Graham Blewitt and the prosecutorial staff generally are </p><p>committed to achieving the completion strategy, reflected in </p><p>part by the focus on plea agreements.  He noted that all of </p><p>the recent pleas have involved not only senior trial </p><p>attorneys with years of courtroom experience but also junior </p><p>prosecutors hoping to set foot in court for the first time. </p><p>It is the junior rank-and-file one would expect to be </p><p>personally disappointed in the completion strategy, but </p><p>Johnson emphasized that even such individuals are firmly </p><p>"with the program" and worked hard to make the recent plea </p><p>agreements happen.  He understood as natural the concern than </p><p>trial attorneys want to go to trial and that investigators </p><p>want to see their targets indicted and detained, but </p><p>according to him it is less important to these people where </p><p>such perpetrators are tried than that they are in fact tried. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In Johnson\'s view, the elements outlined above -- plea </p><p>agreements and the fast-tracking of cases -- need to be </p><p>supplemented by a focus not just on the fact of transferring </p><p>cases to national jurisdictions but how that would occur. </p><p>Because, in his view, Chief Prosecutor Del Ponte has not been </p><p>a champion of these elements, he believes they need the </p><p>strong encouragement of the international community.  Johnson </p><p>said that the chief prosecutor, for instance, has </p><p>consistently had problems with plea agreements, rejecting the </p><p>advice of her senior prosecutors to accept one draft </p><p>agreement (which instead is going to trial) because it </p><p>recommended a sentence of fifteen to twenty years rather than </p><p>twenty to twenty-five.  Echoing what embassy legal officers </p><p>have heard from contacts in the Registry and chambers, </p><p>Johnson noted that Del Ponte has disallowed her staff to </p><p>participate in discussions aimed at determining how </p><p>indictees, indictments and other investigative files might be </p><p>transferred to national jurisdictions.  As a result, he said, </p><p>almost no work has been done to prepare the groundwork for </p><p>the transfer of cases from the ICTY, a central feature of the </p><p>completion strategy. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment: Plea agreements are not particularly popular </p><p>among victims groups, who tell OTP, for instance, that </p><p>Obrenovic and Nikolic are getting lenient treatment despite </p><p>their role in the Srebrenica massacres that took thousands of </p><p>lives.  The fact that senior prosecutors nonetheless are </p><p>pursuing such agreements suggests an understanding of the </p><p>resource pressures brought to bear by the completion </p><p>strategy.  Further agreements are likely to be reached in </p><p>coming weeks and months, and we suspect that the initial </p><p>targets will be in the imminent-trial cases, such as the </p><p>Dubrovnik case.  To Johnson\'s mind, the international </p><p>community\'s encouragement of such agreements -- for instance, </p><p>as a possible preambular paragraph in reftel\'s draft UN </p><p>Security Council resolution -- would provide additional </p><p>assistance to those in OTP trying to map out a route to </p><p>achieving the completion strategy target dates.  End comment. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
