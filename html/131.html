<p>S E C R E T  STATE 227611 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:        IR, IZ, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:     IRAN/IRAQ WAR: SITUATION IN TEHRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ISLAMABAD 15582 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DEPARTMENT APPRECIATES VERY MUCH MFA ADDITIONAL </p><p>SECRETARY KHAN\'S READOUT OF HIS RECENT VISIT TO TEHRAN </p><p>(REFTEL).  WE AGREE WITH HIS GENERAL ASSESSMENT THAT </p><p>THERE ARE NO SIGNS THAT THE IRANIAN SIDE IS READY TO MOVE </p><p>TOWARD MEDIATION/NEGOTIATIONS ON THE WAR.  WE ALSO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT HE IS CORRECT THAT A MAJOR IRANIAN OFFENSIVE </p><p>SHOULD BE EXPECTED WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, IF IT </p><p>CAN BE MANAGED LOGISTICALLY.  WE WERE STRUCK, HOWEVER, </p><p>AND VERY INTERESTED, IN HIS COMMENTS REGARDING IRANIAN </p><p>MORALE AND DECREASING SUPPORT FOR THE REVOLUTION WHICH HE </p><p>OBSERVED, BOTH IN TEHRAN AND THE COUNTRYSIDE.  HIS </p><p>OBSERVATION ON THE MODERATE GROUP AMONG THE CLERGY WAS </p><p>ALSO OF GREAT INTEREST TO US.  ON DOMESTIC IRANIAN ISSUES </p><p>AS WELL AS ON MATTERS OF SHIA THEOLOGY AND THE </p><p>INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE CLERGY AND THE GOVERNMENT, SUCH </p><p>A GROUP HAS BEEN IDENTIFIABLE FOR SOME TIME.  WE HAVE NOT </p><p>SEEN, HOWEVER, RECENT EVIDENCE THAT ITS DIFFERENCES WITH </p><p>THE DOMINANT, MORE RADICAL GROUP EXTENDED TO OPPOSITION </p><p>TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WITH THAT AS BACKGROUND, WE WOULD APPRECIATE EMBASSY </p><p>FOLLOWING UP WITH KHAN, FOCUSSING ON THE FOLLOWING </p><p>QUESTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>   -THE CHANGED ATMOSPHERE IN TEHRAN: ON WHAT DOES HE </p><p>HINGE HIS JUDGMENT THAT THE MOOD TOWARD THE REVOLUTION OR </p><p>THE WAR HAS CHANGED?  SPECIFICALLY, WHAT ARE HIS GROUNDS </p><p>TO BELIEVE THAT THE FRUSTRATIONS NOTED REFTEL EXTEND TO </p><p>LOWER CLASS SUPPORTERS OF THE REGIME AND ARE THUS NOT </p><p>JUST A MIDDLE CLASS PHENOMENON?  DO THE PAKISTANIS </p><p>BELIEVE THEY HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF POLITICAL TRENDS IN </p><p>SOUTH TEHRAN, FOR EXAMPLE? (SOUTH TEHRAN IS THE LOWER </p><p>CLASS RESIDENTIAL AREA OF THE CAPITAL, WHERE MANY OF THE </p><p>RECENT MIGRANTS FROM THE COUNTRY LIVE). </p><p> </p><p>   --ON WHAT BASIS DOES HE JUDGE THAT THE MOOD "IN THE </p><p>COUNTRYSIDE" HAS CHANGED ALONG THE LINES OF THE MOOD IN </p><p>TEHRAN?  HOW DOES HE MEASURE/ASSESS THAT MOOD? </p><p> </p><p>   --THE COMPOSITION OF THE MODERATE CLERICAL GROUP </p><p>INTERESTS US.  WHO ARE ITS LEADERS?  PROMINENT </p><p>SUPPORTERS?  HOW DOES KHAN KNOW THEIR VIEWS ON THE WAR </p><p>(AS OPPOSED TO DOMESTIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL QUESTIONS </p><p>WHICH ARE SUBJECTS OF OPEN DEBATE)?  DOES HE HAVE THE </p><p>SENSE THAT THIS GROUP IS GROWING IN IMPORTANCE?  AND, </p><p>ABOVE ALL, DOES HE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>SUBJECT OF THE IRANIAN VIEW OF THE WAR IS A MATTER OF </p><p>POTENTIAL DEBATE OR CONCEIVABLE CHANGE OF POLICY WHILE </p><p>AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI REMAINS IN ACTIVE CONTROL OF THE </p><p>REGIME?  IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT A MIDDLE GROUND </p><p>MIGHT DEVELOP (OR EXISTS) WHEREBY IRAN WOULD ACCEPT AN </p><p>END TO THE WAR AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM </p><p>POWER, BUT NOT THE ELIMINATION OF BAATH PARTY CONTROL OF </p><p>THE STATE? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHULTZ </p><p></p></div>
