<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 DHAKA 004187 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR EB/ESC, INR/SA, DRL </p><p>USDOC FOR 4530 ITA/ANESA/OSA, 6000 ADVOCACY CENTER </p><p>ISLAMABAD PLEASE ALSO PASS TO A/S INDERFURTH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 9/4/07 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EPET, ECON, BG, US </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S INTRODUCTORY MEETING WITH </p><p>BANGLADESH PRIME MINISTER SHEIKH HASINA </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN HOLZMAN.  REASON </p><p>1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  PRIME MINISTER SHEIKH HASINA USED </p><p>HER INTRODUCTORY MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR HOLZMAN TO </p><p>PRESS HARD FOR A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO BANGLADESH. </p><p>SHE SAID THAT SHE, AND THE PEOPLE OF BANGLADESH, "ARE </p><p>EXPECTING A VISIT BY THE PRESIDENT."  FOREIGN </p><p>SECRETARY FAROOQ SOBHAN ADDED THAT WHAT HE PERCEIVED </p><p>TO BE A RECENT "GOLDEN AGE" IN U.S.-BANGLADESHI </p><p>RELATIONS WOULD BE DISRUPTED IF THE PRESIDENT DECIDED </p><p>NOT TO COME.  THE PRIME MINISTER ASSURED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT THERE WOULD BE ABSOLUTE FAIRNESS IN </p><p>THE EVALUATIONS OF THE CURRENT ROUND OF GAS BIDS, AND </p><p>ADDED THAT SHE WOULD ENDEAVOR TO ACCELERATE THE </p><p>APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE UNOCAL PRODUCTION-SHARING </p><p>CONTRACT (PSC), SO THAT THE AGREEMENT COULD BE SIGNED </p><p>DURING A/S INDERFURTH\'S VISIT NEXT WEEK.  THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER THANKED THE U.S. FOR ASSISTING WITH THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF HER FAMILY MEMBERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON SEPTEMBER 3, AMBASSADOR HOLZMAN, </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY DCM TED NIST (NOTETAKER), PAID AN </p><p>INTRODUCTORY CALL ON PRIME MINISTER SHEIKH HASINA. </p><p>ALSO IN ATTENDANCE WERE FOREIGN SECRETARY FAROOQ </p><p>SOBHAN, MFA AMERICAS AND PACIFIC DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>ASHRAF UD-DOULA, PRINCIPAL SECRETARY TO THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER S.A. SAMAD, PRESS SECRETARY TO THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER JAWADUL KARIM, AND ASSISTANT PRIVATE </p><p>SECRETARY TO THE PRIME MINISTER IBRAHEEM HOSEIN KHAN. </p><p> </p><p>"WE EXPECT YOUR PRESIDENT TO COME TO BANGLADESH" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>4. (C) FOLLOWING AN EXCHANGE OF PLEASANTRIES, </p><p>AMBASSADOR HOLZMAN DISCUSSED POSSIBLE VISITS TO THE </p><p>REGION BY U.S. OFFICIALS.  HE OBSERVED THAT ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY INDERFURTH WOULD BE COMING NEXT WEEK.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT BOTH PRESIDENT CLINTON AND SECRETARY </p><p>ALBRIGHT ARE CONSIDERING TRIPS TO THE REGION, BUT </p><p>STRESSED THAT NEITHER HAS DECIDED DEFINITELY TO COME </p><p>TO BANGLADESH.  THE PRIME MINISTER RESPONDED "WE </p><p>EXPECT (PRESIDENT CLINTON) TO COME TO BANGLADESH." </p><p>SHE REMEMBERED FONDLY MRS. CLINTON\'S TRIP TO </p><p>BANGLADESH IN 1995, AND THEIR EXPERIENCE IN FEBRUARY </p><p>AS CO-CHAIRS OF THE MICROCREDIT SUMMIT IN </p><p>WASHINGTON.  SHE RECALLED HER "EXCELLENT MEETING" </p><p>WITH THE PRESIDENT AND MRS. CLINTON IN THE WHITE </p><p>HOUSE, AND SAID SHE APPRECIATED THE LETTER THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HAD SENT HER FOLLOWING THE DENVER ECONOMIC </p><p>SUMMIT.  SHE NOTED THE "STRONG LINKS" THAT THE AWAMI </p><p>LEAGUE HAS WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, INCLUDING ITS </p><p>ASSISTANCE WITH FUND-RAISING AND POLITICAL ACTION. </p><p>SHE ALSO RECALLED HER ATTENDANCE AT THE 1992 </p><p>DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION.  IT\'S NOT JUST THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, SHE CONCLUDED: "THE PEOPLE OF BANGLADESH </p><p>WANT PRESIDENT CLINTON TO VISIT." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) FOREIGN SECRETARY SOBHAN ECHOED THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S SENTIMENTS.  THIS IS SOMETHING THE ENTIRE </p><p>COUNTRY IS LOOKING FORWARD TO, HE SAID.  HE ADDED </p><p>THAT IN HIS VIEW, PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S VISIT WILL BE </p><p>AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL OF U.S. SUPPORT FOR BANGLADESH\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN DEMOCRACY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE.  A </p><p>CLINTON VISIT, HE SAID, WOULD BE A VERY POWERFUL </p><p>SIGNAL TO THE PEOPLE IN BANGLADESH AND THE REGION, </p><p>AND WOULD REINFORCE BANGLADESH\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY.  A DECISION BY THE PRESIDENT </p><p>NOT TO COME WOULD, HE SAID, CAUSE "SERIOUS </p><p>MISGIVINGS."  HE ADDED THAT "WE DON\'T HAVE </p><p>EXAGGERATED EXPECTATIONS ... EVEN A ONE-DAY VISIT </p><p>WOULD BE APPRECIATED." </p><p> </p><p>A "GOLDEN AGE"? </p><p>--------------- </p><p>6. (C) ON A ROLL, SOBHAN CHARACTERIZED THE LAST </p><p>FOURTEEN MONTHS (SINCE THE ELECTION OF THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER) AS A "GOLDEN AGE" OF U.S.-BANGLADESHI </p><p>RELATIONS.  HE POINTED TO THE PRIME MINISTER\'S TWO </p><p>TRIPS TO THE UNITED STATES, HER MEETINGS WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND MRS. CLINTON IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND </p><p>THE MICROCREDIT SUMMIT.  HE ALSO NOTED THE RECENT </p><p>INCREASE IN U.S. INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE </p><p>ENERGY FIELD. </p><p> </p><p>GAS </p><p>--- </p><p>7. (C) THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT IN THIS </p><p>CONNECTION, THERE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION AND </p><p>CONCERN ON THE PART OF A NUMBER OF THE U.S. COMPANIES </p><p>THAT SUBMITTED BIDS JULY 16 FOR THE SECOND GAS </p><p>ROUND.  SOME AMERICAN COMPANIES ARE CONCERNED THAT </p><p>ANOTHER COMPANY, NOT FROM THE U.S. (NOTE: SHELL.  END </p><p>NOTE), HAS BEEN GIVEN AN ADVANTAGE IN THE EVALUATION </p><p>OF ITS BIDS.  U.S. COMPANIES, HE STRESSED, WILL BE </p><p>ABLE TO LIVE WITH THE RESULTS, SO LONG AS THE PROCESS </p><p>IS FAIR AND OPEN, AND THE OUTCOME CLEARLY SERVES </p><p>BANGLADESH\'S NATIONAL INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) AFTER CONFERRING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, </p><p>PRINCIPAL SECRETARY SAMAD SAID THE EVALUATION PROCESS </p><p>WILL BE TRANSPARENT, AND THE PLAYING FIELD WILL BE </p><p>LEVEL FOR ALL COMPETITORS.  THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE WILL SCRUTINIZE THE PROCESS, HE SAID, EVEN </p><p>BEFORE THE "SHORT LISTS" ARE PREPARED.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>OF THE FOUR CONCERNS ALREADY WITH CONCESSIONS IN </p><p>BANGLADESH, THREE ARE AMERICAN. (NOTE: THE THREE ARE </p><p>OCCIDENTAL, UNITED MERIDIAN, AND REXWOOD/OKLAND.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, HALLIBURTON AND UNOCAL HAVE CONTRACTUAL </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER CONCESSIONAIRES.  END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE PRIME MINISTER ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT </p><p>THERE WOULD BE "ABSOLUTE FAIRNESS" IN THE EVALUATION </p><p>OF THE BIDS, AND SAID THAT SHE HAS GIVEN VERY </p><p>SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO THOSE WHO ARE WORKING ON IT </p><p>TO TREAT ALL COMPANIES FAIRLY.  SAMAD ADDED THAT THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER HAD ASSIGNED HIM TO OVERSEE THE </p><p>PROCESS.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CREDIBILITY IN THE BID </p><p>ROUND IS "TERRIBLY IMPORTANT." </p><p> </p><p>UNOCAL SIGNING PROPOSAL </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>10. (C) THE AMBASSADOR THEN MADE A SPECIFIC </p><p>SUGGESTION - THAT THE BDG MOVE QUICKLY IN APPROVING </p><p>THE PSC (PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT) FOR THE UNOCAL </p><p>SHAHBAZPUR PROJECT, SO THAT THE AGREEMENT COULD BE </p><p>SIGNED DURING ASSISTANT SECRETARY INDERFURTH\'S VISIT </p><p>TO BANGLADESH ON SEPTEMBER 10-12.  THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>RESPONDED, "SURE; I THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE." </p><p>SAMAD SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE </p><p>"AT LEAST TO INITIAL" THE CONTRACTS, BUT AMBASSADOR </p><p>HOLZMAN PRESSED TO HAVE A REAL SIGNING, SO THAT </p><p>UNOCAL COULD BEGIN ITS WORK AT THE OUTSET OF THE </p><p>COMING DRY SEASON, AND MAKE GOOD ON ITS AGREEMENT TO </p><p>DELIVER GAS TO POWER PLANTS FOR THE ENERGY-STARVED </p><p>WESTERN REGION (SHEIKH HASINA COMES FROM THIS REGION). </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY CONCERNS </p><p>----------------- </p><p>11. (C) THE PRIME MINISTER CLOSED BY NOTING HER </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE USG\'S PROTECTION OF HER FAMILY </p><p>IN THE UNITED STATES, AND REQUESTED ITS HELP IN </p><p>APPREHENDING ANY PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF HER FATHER\'S </p><p>KILLING WHO MIGHT BE IN THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>AMBASSADOR HOLZMAN NOTED THAT IF ANY OF THE SUSPECTS </p><p>WERE IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY WOULD PROBABLY </p><p>REQUEST ASYLUM; AFTER THAT, THEIR FATE WOULD BE IN </p><p>THE HANDS OF THE COURT SYSTEM, WHICH COULD MOVE VERY </p><p>SLOWLY.  DCM ADDED THAT THE USG WOULD APPRECIATE ANY </p><p>INFORMATION THE BDG MIGHT HAVE ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC </p><p>THREATS TO MEMBERS OF THE PRIME MINISTER\'S FAMILY, SO </p><p>THAT WE CAN PASS THIS INFORMATION TO LOCAL LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>12. (C) THIS WAS A VERY CORDIAL FIRST MEETING.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR BEGAN BY GIVING THE PRIME MINISTER A </p><p>POPULAR AMERICAN CHILDREN\'S BOOK FOR HER NEW </p><p>GRANDDAUGHTER, AND THIS CLEARLY PUT THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER IN A VERY FRIENDLY FRAME OF MIND. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) THE BDG IS PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS FOR A </p><p>CLINTON VISIT.  ANYONE WHO IS PERCEIVED BY THE BDG TO </p><p>HAVE ANY INFLUENCE OVER THIS DECISION CAN EXPECT TO </p><p>BE LOBBIED, AND LOBBIED HARD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOLZMAN </p><p></p></div>
