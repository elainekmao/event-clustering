<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001870 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR CA/OCS/CI, CA/OCS/ACS/EAP, CA/OCS/PRI, </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR CA/VO/F/P, EAP/BCLTV, AND L/EAP </p><p>Bangkok for DHS/DD </p><p>Ho Chi Minh City for CONS and DHS OIC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KOCI, CVIS, CASC, PREL, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM ADOPTIONS:  NO FORWARD MOTION, LOSS OF </p><p>YARDAGE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HANOI 1759 B) STATE 168760, C) AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.   The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) </p><p>reorganization has all but halted forward progress on </p><p>reaching any bilateral understanding on adoptions.  Post has </p><p>yet to receive written confirmation that a document other </p><p>than a bilateral agreement will be acceptable, and has been </p><p>told that the offices of the Prime Minister and State </p><p>President are not currently likely to accept anything other </p><p>than a bilateral agreement.  In addition, the GVN\'s former </p><p>lead adoption agreement negotiator (who was the principal </p><p>source of support for the USG position) is no longer in </p><p>charge.  We expect little progress in the foreseeable future </p><p>as the Ministry of Justice\'s new Office of International </p><p>Adoptions gets up and running.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>NO ONE IN CHARGE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) As initially reported ref A, a July 12 </p><p>reorganization within MOJ resulted in the nominal shifting </p><p>of responsibilities for adoptions negotiations to the newly </p><p>created Office of International Adoptions (OIA).  However, </p><p>OIA is still in transition.  The individuals formerly </p><p>responsible for adoption "agreements" no longer have any </p><p>decision-making authority, and their successors (and their </p><p>roles) have not yet been identified. </p><p> </p><p>NO RESPONSE </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On July 11, the Consular section contacted MOJ </p><p>Director of International Cooperation, Nguyen Van Binh, to </p><p>reiterate the USG request for written confirmation that a </p><p>document other than a bilateral agreement would be </p><p>acceptable.  When no response to the request was </p><p>forthcoming, the Consular section contacted Binh again on </p><p>July 16.  Binh admitted that the offices of the Prime </p><p>Minister and State President are opposed to any document </p><p>that is not a formal bilateral agreement.  Additionally, </p><p>Binh noted that he strongly believes that if he officially </p><p>asks for approval to move forward with negotiation of a </p><p>document other than a bilateral agreement at this time, the </p><p>answer will be "no." </p><p> </p><p>BINH IS AN ALLY... </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Binh said that he had been trying to find legal </p><p>precedents in which the GVN entered into (and the State </p><p>President ratified) an accord that was not a bilateral </p><p>agreement, but to date has been unsuccessful.  He has </p><p>requested the assistance of the Vietnamese Embassy in </p><p>Washington in this matter. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Binh nonetheless expressed hope in building </p><p>consensus in support of an MOU, Protocol, or similar </p><p>document within the interagency working group on </p><p>international adoptions.  This group will include members of </p><p>all relevant Ministries, as well as representatives of the </p><p>offices of the Prime Minister and State President.  It is </p><p>the same group that will consider our latest draft Protocol. </p><p>Binh asked for more time to build this consensus.  He stated </p><p>that no interagency working group meeting would take place </p><p>until after the staffing of the MOJ\'s new Office of </p><p>International Adoptions was clarified, the issues thoroughly </p><p>reviewed by the new staff, and summer vacation season was </p><p>over.  The earliest this meeting could take place is late </p><p>September or October. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... BUT IS NO LONGER IN CHARGE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Unfortunately, however, Binh is no longer the </p><p>point person for adoptions - his Prime Ministerial </p><p>designation as lead negotiator for international adoptions </p><p>expired July 12.  Binh now serves only as an "advisor" on </p><p>the issue while OIA gets up to speed.  Per ref A, Binh has </p><p>said that it was unlikely that he would be assigned to head </p><p>up the new OIA. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Binh has consistently demonstrated an understanding </p><p>of the U.S. position and a willingness to work with us to </p><p>reach bilateral consensus.  However, with the loss of his </p><p>authority as lead negotiator for international adoptions, it </p><p>is not at all clear that he will be in a position to </p><p>influence policy decisions in this area. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) What is clear is that, with the creation of OIA, </p><p>we are potentially back to square one.  The change in </p><p>personnel responsible for international adoptions is likely </p><p>to result in a thorough re-evaluation of the issues and the </p><p>GVN\'s position.  Given the current opposition in the offices </p><p>of the Prime Minister and the State President, and further </p><p>given the tendency of GVN officials to reject positions of </p><p>their predecessors in an effort to exert authority, </p><p>cultivating support with the new personnel in the OIA will </p><p>be an uphill battle. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) We will continue to make every effort - engaging </p><p>both Binh and the (as yet unnamed) new officials at OIA - to </p><p>move forward with the latest draft.  However, we expect </p><p>little progress in the foreseeable future as the OIA </p><p>concentrates on getting up and running. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
