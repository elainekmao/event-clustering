<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 TEGUCIGALPA 002959 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, WHA, WHA/CEN, PM, AND INR/B </p><p>NSC FOR MAISTO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, MASS, MCAP, ETRD, PINR, HO, XK </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN MINDEF OUTLINES REGIONAL DISARMAMENT </p><p>PLAN; EMERGES AS LEADING NATIONAL SECURITY FIGURE IN GOH </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEGUCIGALPA 2534 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolChief Francisco Palmieri; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Minister of Defense Federico Breve used his </p><p>introductory courtesy call with the Ambassador to outline an </p><p>ambitious Honduran regional disarmament policy initiative </p><p>that seeks to complement the current push for greater </p><p>regional economic integration.  Breve\'s vision is in line </p><p>with U.S. policy goals and highlights how civilian leadership </p><p>of Latin American militaries can advance U.S. interests in </p><p>the region.  We expect Breve to be named as President Ricardo </p><p>Maduro\'s National Security Advisor in the near future.  He </p><p>will be dual-hatted and keep the Defense Ministry portfolio. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Changing Region\'s Military Paradigm to Favor Integration </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During the Ambassador\'s initial courtesy call on </p><p>October 23, Minister of Defense Federico &Fred8 Breve </p><p>described in broad terms a Government of Honduras (GOH) </p><p>initiative that seeks to reduce the size of regional </p><p>militaries and number of armaments in Central America.  He </p><p>explained that President Ricardo Maduro has proposed a </p><p>regional disarmament initiative to his fellow Central </p><p>American Presidents.  Maduro and Breve believe that reducing </p><p>the size of the region\'s military forces and amount of </p><p>military expenditures would boost regional economic </p><p>integration efforts.  Breve told the Ambassador that the </p><p>possibility of armed military confrontation between Central </p><p>American countries was now in the past.  He said that </p><p>President Maduro believes that regional disarmament could </p><p>foster increased cooperation and build mutual trust among the </p><p>region\'s countries; something that Maduro also mentioned </p><p>previously in an August 28 meeting with WHA A/S Otto Reich </p><p>(reftel). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Breve told the Ambassador that President Maduro has </p><p>discussed this idea with Salvadoran President Francisco </p><p>Flores and Nicaraguan President Enrique Bolanos.  All three </p><p>presidents are interested in the topic and agreed that it </p><p>should be tabled as an agenda item for further discussion at </p><p>upcoming summits of Central American presidents.  Breve said </p><p>that Flores expressed stronger interest in the idea because </p><p>Flores sees its potential to change the fundamental paradigm </p><p>of relations among the Central American countries.  Flores </p><p>and Maduro believe a regional disarmament agreement could </p><p>send a bold message to the international investment community </p><p>that there is a new spirit of political stability in Central </p><p>America.  However, Breve cautioned that while Flores is </p><p>personally interested in the concept, he is moving slowly in </p><p>advancing the issue with his own military in El Salvador, in </p><p>part because El Salvador has some important pending arms </p><p>purchases.  Bolanos, Breve noted, is even more limited in how </p><p>he can respond because of the still strong influence of the </p><p>Sandinistas on Nicaraguan military attitudes. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Seeking Balance in U.S. Military Assistance to Region </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Breve acknowledged that the GOH initiative is at a </p><p>very preliminary stage but asked the Ambassador for U.S. </p><p>support.  He has said previously that ministerial-level talks </p><p>with El Salvador were encouraging but revealed that El </p><p>Salvador was not ready to enter into detailed talks yet. </p><p>Breve suggested that U.S. views would be welcome and </p><p>important to the GOH. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Breve also pointed out that the U.S. could send out </p><p>important signals to the region on this issue.  Breve noted </p><p>that the U.S. is seeking to improve military to military </p><p>relations with the Nicaraguan armed forces and added that </p><p>with the right cues from the U.S. the Nicaraguan military </p><p>might become an ally in this disarmament effort.  In </p><p>addition, he asked that the U.S. pay special attention to the </p><p>overall size of the Nicaraguan military.  He said the GOH </p><p>believes it is once again trying to increase its numbers.  He </p><p>mentioned that U.S. support for Salvadoran military hardware </p><p>purchases be equally and carefully calibrated.  He has noted </p><p>to other EmbOffs that it appears that there is a reduction in </p><p>the size of Guatemalan military underway as well.  (COMMENT: </p><p>Breve, while not saying so directly, feels that there is not </p><p>a balance in U.S. FMF assistance to the region.  As the only </p><p>civilian head of a Central American military, he has pointed </p><p>out to EmbOffs that it would help his standing with his own </p><p>military if he could show some positive results from the U.S. </p><p>for Honduran military assistance requests.  We also note that </p><p>Breve has never linked the Honduran decision to sign an </p><p>International Criminal Court Article 98 agreement with the </p><p>U.S. to any of his requests for U.S. military assistance. END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador replied that the U.S. strongly </p><p>supported regional economic integration efforts that would </p><p>promote a free trade agreement with the Central American </p><p>countries.  The Ambassador said he would inform Washington of </p><p>the GOH interest in regional disarmament and raise the issue </p><p>at an upcoming Chiefs of Mission conference. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Defense Minister\'s National Security Role to Expand </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Defense Minister Breve will likely replace Ramon </p><p>Medina Luna as National Security Advisor in the near future. </p><p>Multiple sources have told post that President Maduro is </p><p>giving Breve this expanded portfolio because Breve has </p><p>successfully managed the Honduran Armed Forces\' (HOAF\'s) </p><p>support for the &zero-tolerance8 crime campaign.  The </p><p>military\'s support has been steadfast and continual, when </p><p>many doubted the HOAF,s ability to sustain its </p><p>participation.  Breve also told the Ambassador that he is </p><p>fully committed to expanding the military\'s role in the drug </p><p>interdiction war.  He explained that while the police have </p><p>the legal mandate to fight drug trafficking they do not have </p><p>the wherewithal to do the job. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Breve said he is very happy with his role in the </p><p>Maduro government.  He said that his lack of previous </p><p>military experience was proving to be an advantage in running </p><p>the Defense Ministry.  He explained that his private sector </p><p>background allowed him to bring a business-like approach to </p><p>his management of the Ministry.  He had already been able to </p><p>improve the Ministry\'s contracting procedures and to </p><p>negotiate better deals with some long-term military </p><p>suppliers.  He also remarked that he had an excellent </p><p>relationship with the Chief of the Joint Staff General Isaias </p><p>Barahona.  Breve said that General Barahona was proving to be </p><p>an excellent choice because he commands the full respect of </p><p>his troops and has a well-developed understanding of the role </p><p>of the military in peacetime. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT:  President Maduro was preparing to raise this </p><p>disarmament initiative during the now-postponed visit of </p><p>Secretary Powell earlier in the month.  Both the President </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>and Defense Minister firmly believe that a regional </p><p>disarmament effort could positively catalyze regional </p><p>economic integration efforts by reducing the threat of </p><p>military action over ongoing border disputes and </p><p>demonstrating to the international community the political </p><p>maturity of the current regional political leadership.  Breve </p><p>also freely concedes that since Honduras has the smallest </p><p>armed forces in the region it has much to gain from this </p><p>initiative.  He admits that the GOH\'s budget situation will </p><p>limit the growth of the Honduran armed forces in the near </p><p>future and that he does not anticipate any significant GOH </p><p>investment in military arms or hardware in the short-term. </p><p>When Breve assumes the National Security portfolio, post </p><p>expects him to be a more reliable and responsive interlocutor </p><p>than Medina Luna.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Bio Note: Federico (Fred) BREVE Travieso </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Federico (Fred) BREVE Travieso was born August 18, </p><p>1945 in Tegucigalpa and is married.  After attending the </p><p>American School in Tegucigalpa, he earned a B.S. from McGill </p><p>University in Montreal, Canada, and an MBA from the INCAE in </p><p>Managua, Nicaragua.  He is a businessman and construction </p><p>contractor and has built a small business empire in Honduras. </p><p> From 1990 to 1993, Breve Travieso was the General Manager of </p><p>the Honduran electric company, National Electric Energy </p><p>Company (ENEE).  In a 1992 survey conducted by the </p><p>Tegucigalpa newspaper La Tribuna, Breve received the dubious </p><p>honor of being the \'worst official of the year\' with almost </p><p>twice the votes of the official who came in second place.  In </p><p>1991, he was embroiled in a scandal in which he allegedly </p><p>orchestrated the payment of USD 2.8 million of debt owed to </p><p>ENEE by Panama through Corporacion Financiera S.A. (COFISA). </p><p>Coincidentally, relatives of high-level Honduran government </p><p>officials owned COFISA.  (Comment:  At this point, we do not </p><p>know if there was or is any connection between President </p><p>Maduro and COFISA.  However, during the COFISA scandal, </p><p>Maduro was president of the Central Bank of Honduras.  End </p><p>comment.)  Breve sits on the boards of numerous local </p><p>corporations and is the president and general manager of a </p><p>construction company that held the local contract for </p><p>expansion of the U.S. Embassy.  He speaks excellent English. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
