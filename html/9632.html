<p>UNCLAS HANOI 001885 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; INL/AAE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, PREL, PINS, LA, VM, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  LARGEST DRUG BUST EVER IN VIETNAM (PART II) </p><p> </p><p>REF: HANOI 01504 </p><p> </p><p>  1.  (U) SUMMARY.  Some of Vietnam\'s state-controlled </p><p>  media have reported that a second comprehensive search of </p><p>  the same truck seized on June 9 led to the recent </p><p>  discovery of another 33 kilograms of heroin, in addition </p><p>  to the 40 kilograms uncovered during the first </p><p>  inspection.  A senior Customs official has speculated </p><p>  that Provincial Government authorities might be involved </p><p>  with the traffickers.    END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>  --------------- </p><p>  CASE BACKGROUND </p><p>  --------------- </p><p> </p><p>  2.  (U) According to the Ho Chi Minh City-based "Tuoi </p><p>  Tre" newspaper (owned by the Communist Young League) and </p><p>  police newspapers, a second, more complete search was </p><p>  conducted June 25 on the truck initially seized by Quang </p><p>  Tri counternarcotics police on June 9 (ref a).  Local </p><p>  authorities found an additional 33 kilograms of heroin </p><p>  hidden under 10 tons of scrap metal.  Together with the </p><p>  first seizure, officers have so far uncovered a total of </p><p>  73 kilograms of heroin in this one shipment.  (Note: </p><p>  During all of 2002, GVN law enforcement entities seized </p><p>  only 55 kilograms of heroin throughout the entire </p><p>  country.  End note).  During subsequent interrogations, </p><p>  the truck driver Nguyen Dinh Hoanh confessed to police </p><p>  how he had hidden the drugs in the truck underneath the </p><p>  scrap metal. </p><p> </p><p>  --------------------------- </p><p>  WHO MAY BE BEHIND ALL THIS? </p><p>  --------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>  3.   (U) Records at the Lao Bao Border gate reportedly </p><p>  showed that, between May 2002 and June 2003, Hoanh made a </p><p>  total of 17 trips through this border crossing, importing </p><p>  "scrap metal" from Laos for various companies in Vietnam. </p><p>  On the last two trips, Hoanh was transporting "scrap </p><p>  metal" for Phuong Quang Trading Company, said to be owned </p><p>  by Le Van Quang, described as the younger brother of </p><p>  Director of Quang Tri Provincial Customs Department Le </p><p>  Van Toi.  Le Thanh Hien, Deputy Director of the Anti- </p><p>  smuggling Department of Vietnam\'s General Department of </p><p>  Customs, speculated publicly that Hoanh had effectively </p><p>  used the Toi\'s name to ward off further scrutiny each </p><p>  time he went through customs procedures at the border. </p><p>  Hien added that he personally did not think that Toi was </p><p>  involved with the trafficking, but did not rule out the </p><p>  possibility of a further investigation. </p><p> </p><p>  4. (U) Comment:  No one comes out looking very good out </p><p>  of this case, which should have been a relative triumph </p><p>  for the understaffed and underfunded provincial </p><p>  counternarcotics police.  The clear implication of </p><p>  complicity by GVN officials, and the likelihood that </p><p>  personal rivalries may have led to a tip-off about the </p><p>  truck and its contents may explain why this case did not </p><p>  receive broader coverage in the Vietnamese media. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
