<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L JERUSALEM 002756 </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR LEVERETT </p><p>NEA FOR FRONT OFFICE AND NEA/IPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KPAL, KWBG, PGOV, PREL, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: FATAH LEADER ON HAMAS CELL IN JERUSALEM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) TEL AVIV 4184 B) JERUSALEM 2729 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING PRINCIPAL OFFICER MARY DRAPER, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: A SENIOR FATAH OFFICIAL AND PLC MEMBER </p><p>CRITICIZED HAMAS FOR CONDUCTING OPERATIONS IN JERUSALEM, </p><p>SAYING THIS WAS PART OF A WIDER COMPETITION BETWEEN FATAH AND </p><p>HAMAS OVER WHICH DIRECTION TO TAKE THE RESISTANCE.  THE </p><p>DISCOVERY OF A HAMAS CELL IN EAST JERUSALEM WILL COMPLICATE </p><p>THE ONGOING CEASE-FIRE TALKS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES, IN HIS </p><p>VIEW.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) HATEM ABDEL QADER, A MEMBER OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL FOR JERUSALEM AND FATAH\'S HIGH COMMITTEE </p><p>FOR THE WEST BANK, TOLD POLCHIEF 8/22 THAT HAMAS OPERATIONS </p><p>INSIDE JERUSALEM VIOLATED AN UNDERSTANDING WITH FATAH NOT TO </p><p>CONDUCT SUCH ACTIVITIES IN JERUSALEM.  RECENT REVELATIONS OF </p><p>A HAMAS CELL IN EAST JERUSALEM COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE </p><p>PLIGHT OF THE 220,000 PALESTINIANS LIVING IN EAST JERUSALEM, </p><p>AND WOULD CERTAINLY COMPLICATE THE BROADER, ONGOING </p><p>CEASE-FIRE TALKS BETWEEN FATAH AND HAMAS, HE SAID.  FATAH\'S </p><p>POLICY ON JERUSALEM, ACCORDING TO ABDEL QADER, HAS BEEN TO </p><p>EMPLOY NON-VIOLENT MEANS TO PRESS THE GOI ON </p><p>JERSULEM-SPECIFIC ISSUES (I.E., HOME DEMOLITIONS, LAND AND ID </p><p>CONFISCATIONS, EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ABDEL QADER SAID THAT THE PRESENCE OF A HAMAS CELL IN </p><p>JERUSALEM WAS A MANIFESTATION OF A LARGER ONGOING COMPETITION </p><p>BETWEEN FATAH AND HAMAS OVER RESISTANCE TACTICS.  HAMAS WAS </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL AND MAXIMALIST, WHILE FATAH WAS PRAGMATIC AND </p><p>FOCUSED; THAT\'S WHY FATAH WAS NOW PURSUING A CEASE-FIRE </p><p>(COMMENT: ALBEIT ONE LIMITED GEOGRAPHICALLY TO INSIDE GREEN </p><p>LINE ISRAEL -- SEE REFTELS).  ON ARAFAT\'S ORDERS, FATAH HAD </p><p>HAD TO THREATEN TO EXPEL PARTY MEMBERS FOR TAKING WEAPONS AND </p><p>MONEY FROM HAMAS AND PIJ -- RESOURCES THAT ORIGINATED FROM </p><p>TEHRAN, HE SAID.  IN ADDITION, ABDEL QADER SAID HE WAS </p><p>PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN WHAT HE TERMED "THE BATTLE FOR THE </p><p>CHILDREN" -- A FATAH EFFORT TO COUNTER UNDUE HAMAS INFLUENCE </p><p>IN THE SCHOOLS THAT WAS RADICALIZING PALESTINIAN YOUTH BY </p><p>EXPOSING THEM TO DAILY PROPAGANDA ABOUT ALLEGED ISRAELI </p><p>ATROCITIES.  "THE LAST THING WE WANT IS A RADICAL ISLAMIC </p><p>STATE LIKE IRAN," HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ABDEL QADER EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT FATAH WOULD </p><p>PREVAIL.  FIRST, THE HAMAS LEADERSHIP ITSELF WAS NOW DIVIDED </p><p>OVER RESISTANCE TACTICS, A RIFT THAT FATAH WOULD ATTEMPT TO </p><p>EXPLOIT, HE SAID.  SECOND, MOST PALESTINIANS WERE NOT </p><p>COMFORTABLE WITH HAMAS\' SOCIO-POLITICAL PLATFORM (EVEN IF </p><p>MANY ADMIRED THE PARTY\'S "STEADFASTNESS").  "LET US HAVE </p><p>ELECTIONS AND LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES -- YOU </p><p>WILL SEE, WE WILL WIN." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: EAST JERUSALEM\'S PALESTINIANS HAVE </p><p>TRADITIONALLY BEEN HARDER TO RECRUIT FOR TERRORIST OPERATIONS </p><p>BECAUSE OF THEIR PRIVILEGED POSITION VIS-A-VIS WEST BANK </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  NOT SUBJECT TO TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, THEY ARE </p><p>ECONOMICALLY BETTER OFF, AND ARE ENTITLED TO ISRAELI SOCIAL </p><p>SERVICES THAT, WHILE SHORT OF WHAT ISRAELI CITIZENS ENJOY, </p><p>ARE SUPERIOR TO THOSE THE PA PROVIDES TO PALESTINIANS IN THE </p><p>WEST BANK AND GAZA.  THAT SAID, THE DISCOVERY OF A HAMAS CELL </p><p>IN JERUSALEM IS A REMINDER THAT VIOLENT RESISTANCE STILL </p><p>RESONATES AMONG SOME HERE, AND A SIGN OF THE CONTINUING </p><p>DISUNITY AMONG PALESTINIAN POLITICAL FACTIONS ON ACCEPTABLE </p><p>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DRAPER </p><p></p></div>
