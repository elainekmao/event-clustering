The first sentence is </p><p>moved to the end of paragraph 5.  The remaining content is </p><p>included in the following two paragraphs. </p><p> </p><p>16.  In former paragraph 3, please replace "Virtually all </p><p>Sunni mosques are government funded or subsidized" with </p><p>"The Government funds or subsidizes virtually all Sunni </p><p>mosques". </p><p>17.  In former paragraph 3, please add the following to the </p><p>end of the paragraph:  "All Sunni imams are government- </p><p>employed.  The Government distributes guidance on religious </p><p>sermons to mosques and imams, whether Sunni or Shi\'a, and </p><p>monitors all sermons for political content." </p><p> </p><p>18.  In former paragraph 4, please add the following as new </p><p>sentence 3: "Shi\'a imams are government-appointed only in </p><p>Dubai Emirate." </p><p> </p><p>19.  In former paragraph 5, please add the following to the </p><p>end of the paragraph (from former paragraph 2):  "The </p><p>Government does, however, permit de facto recognition of </p><p>other religions through the issuance of land use permits </p><p>for the construction and operation of religious buildings." </p><p>20.  Please add the following between former paragraphs 5 </p><p>and 6 (Language is taken from "Restrictions" section and </p><p>placed in "Legal/Policy Framework" because the following </p><p>language describes policy.  Language that explains how the </p><p>policy can be restrictive is contained in the </p><p>"Restrictions" section.): </p><p> </p><p>"Non-Muslim groups are permitted to practice their religion </p><p>freely in religious compounds built on land grants from the </p><p>local rulers.  In such cases, a religious group leader </p><p>requests from the local ruler a grant of land (title to </p><p>which remains with the ruler) and permission to build a </p><p>religious building thereon.  Religious groups without land </p><p>grants and religious buildings built thereon are thereby </p><p>limited in their ability to assemble for worship and to </p><p>conduct business, but are allowed to worship on the </p><p>compounds of other religious groups if permitted by such </p><p>religious groups to do so.  Discreet, off-compound private </p><p>and public gatherings are not targeted or disrupted by the </p><p>police or other security forces." </p><p> </p><p>"There are approximately 23 Christian church buildings in </p><p>the UAE built on land donated by the ruling families of the </p><p>emirates in which they are located.  One Hindu temple and </p><p>two Sikh temples also operate in the UAE.  Three emirates </p><p>are home to parochial primary and secondary schools.  Abu </p><p>Dhabi and Dubai Emirates have donated land for Christian </p><p>cemeteries, and Abu Dhabi has donated land for a Bah\'ai </p><p>cemetery.  There are two operating cremation facilities and </p><p>associated cemeteries for the Hindu community, one in Dubai </p><p>and one in Sharjah." </p><p> </p><p>"Non-Muslim religious groups do not receive funds from the </p><p>Government.  However, those with land grants are not </p><p>charged rental payments and some of the religious buildings </p><p>constructed on land grants were donated by the local ruling </p><p>families.  Also, Sharjah Emirate waives payment of </p><p>utilities for religious buildings.  Non-Muslim groups raise </p><p>money from among their congregants and receive financial </p><p>support from abroad.  Religious groups also advertise </p><p>certain religious functions in the press, such as memorial </p><p>services, choral concerts, and fundraising events." </p><p> </p><p>21.  Please delete former paragraph 6 and insert as the </p><p>next paragraph after former paragraph 7 beginning "As the </p><p>state religion...." </p><p> </p><p>22.  In the former second to last paragraph, last sentence, </p><p>please replace "forbidden publicly to eat, drink, or smoke </p><p>during fasting hours" with "forbidden to eat, drink, or </p><p>smoke publicly during fasting hours." </p><p> </p><p>23.  Please add the following as the new second to last </p><p>paragraph: </p><p> </p><p>"The rulers of the various emirates regularly pardoned </p><p>prisoners on religious and national holidays without regard </p><p>to the prisoners\' religious affiliations.  Those pardoned </p><p>generally are serving sentences from 3 to 5 years for </p><p>financial crimes, immigration violations, and other minor </p><p>offenses; pardons reportedly were not extended to prisoners </p><p>convicted of murder, rape, and kidnapping.  Most of the </p><p>pardoned foreign nationals were deported, while those </p><p>jailed for financial crimes were given a grace period to </p><p>settle amounts still owed prior to deportation." </p><p> </p><p>-- RESTRICTIONS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p>24.  In paragraph 1, sentence 2, please delete "either" and </p><p>replace "ministries" with "departments." </p><p> </p><p>25.  In paragraph 1, sentence 3, please replace "controls </p><p>in all mosques the appointment of preachers and the conduct </p><p>of their work" with "controls the appointment of preachers </p><p>and the conduct of their work in all mosques". </p><p> </p><p>26.  Please add the following as new paragraph 2: </p><p> </p><p>"The UAE Government espouses and supports in practice a </p><p>moderate interpretation of Islam.  In concert with other </p><p>governments, in 2001 the Government arrested and detained </p><p>numerous individuals suspected of ties to extremist groups. </p><p>Most of them were subsequently released." </p><p> </p><p>27.  In former paragraph 2, sentence 1, please replace </p><p>"There does not appear to be a formalized method" with </p><p>"There is no formalized method". </p><p> </p><p>28.  In former paragraph 2, sentence 2, please replace </p><p>"access to land to and permission to build a church </p><p>thereon" with "access to land to religious groups with </p><p>permission to build religious buildings thereon." </p><p> </p><p>29.  In former paragraph 2, sentence 3, please replace </p><p>"churches" with "religious buildings" and please replace </p><p>"Christian congregations" with "religious groups". </p><p> </p><p>30.  Please delete former paragraphs 3 and 4.  Reason: </p><p>Moved to "Legal/Policy Framework" section. </p><p> </p><p>31.  In former paragraph 5, sentence 1, please replace "Ras </p><p>Al-Khaymah" with "Ras Al-Khaimah". </p><p> </p><p>32.  In former paragraph 5, please delete sentences 2-4. </p><p>Reason: Sentences moved to "Positive Developments" section </p><p>to join other information on new religious buildings. </p><p> </p><p>33.  In former paragraph 6, please delete sentence 1. </p><p>Reason:  Moved to "Legal/Policy Framework" section. </p><p> </p><p>34.  In former paragraph 6, please replace former sentences </p><p>2 and 3 with the following: </p><p> </p><p>"There is only one Hindu temple for the large Hindu </p><p>community.  There are also only two Sikh temples.  All </p><p>three temples are located in Dubai." </p><p> </p><p>35.  Please delete former paragraph 7.  Reason: Moved to </p><p>"Legal/Policy Framework" section. </p><p> </p><p>36.  Please replace former paragraph 8 with the following: </p><p> </p><p>"The conversion of Muslims to other religions is regarded </p><p>with extreme antipathy; therefore, the Government prohibits </p><p>non-Muslims from proselytizing or distributing religious </p><p>literature under penalty of criminal prosecution and </p><p>imprisonment for engaging in behavior offensive to Islam. </p><p>While there is no law against missionary activities per se, </p><p>the authorities reportedly have threatened to revoke the </p><p>residence permits of persons suspected of public missionary </p><p>activities." </p><p> </p><p>Reason:  Remaining information placed in other following </p><p>paragraphs to improve the flow of this section. </p><p> </p><p>37.  Please add the following paragraphs after former </p><p>paragraph 8 beginning with "The conversion of Muslims to </p><p>other religions": </p><p> </p><p>"In November 2002, two members of the Dubai Police Criminal </p><p>Investigation Department (CID) arrested an evangelical </p><p>Christian pastor for distributing religious materials at a </p><p>public shopping mall in violation of the prohibition </p><p>against proselytizing.  The CID had received a complaint </p><p>from a Muslim expatriate that the pastor had distributed </p><p>religious literature to him at that same location the day </p><p>before.  The pastor was detained for almost one month </p><p>before being released on bail; he provided his passport to </p><p>the authorities as security for his release.  His movements </p><p>in the country were not restricted, and he reportedly </p><p>preached to various church congregations throughout the </p><p>country during his release.  The court gave the religious </p><p>materials to a local panel of Islamic scholars for review </p><p>to determine if they were offensive to Islam -- the panel </p><p>concluded that the religious materials were not inherently </p><p>offensive to Islam, but would be offensive to a Muslim if </p><p>given to a Muslim.  The court convicted the defendant on 27 </p><p>April, sentenced him to one year, suspended the sentence, </p><p>and ordered his deportation.  Although, prior to his </p><p>arrest, the pastor had planned to leave the UAE in January </p><p>2003, he appealed the deportation order and requested a </p><p>grace period to allow his children time to complete the </p><p>school year.  The court granted the requested grace </p><p>period." </p><p> </p><p>"In March 2001, Dubai police arrested four visiting </p><p>noncitizens for violating laws barring non-Muslims from </p><p>proselytizing because they distributed Christian religious </p><p>materials, including videos and CD-ROMs, on a public </p><p>street.  One of those arrested was detained for less than a </p><p>week.  Authorities held the passports of those arrested </p><p>during the investigation; the accused persons deposited </p><p>their passports as security to guarantee their appearance </p><p>in court.  They were able to move freely about Dubai but </p><p>not permitted to leave the emirate.  The charges against </p><p>the noncitizens were dropped on April 8, 2001, and they </p><p>left the country on April 9." </p><p> </p><p>38.  In former paragraph 9, sentence 1, please replace </p><p>"foreigners to declare" with "foreigners applying for </p><p>residence permits to declare". </p><p>39.  In former paragraph 9, sentence 1, please replace "the </p><p>Government does not collect" with "the Government </p><p>reportedly does not collect". </p><p> </p><p>40.  Please add the following new paragraph after former </p><p>paragraph 9 beginning with "Immigration authorities </p><p>routinely....": </p><p> </p><p>"In addition customs authorities have questioned the entry </p><p>of large quantities of religious materials (such as Bibles </p><p>and hymnals) that they deemed in excess of the normal </p><p>requirements of existing congregations, although in most </p><p>instances the items have been permitted entry.  Customs </p><p>authorities reportedly are less likely to question the </p><p>importation of Christian religious items than non-Muslim, </p><p>non-Christian religious items, although in virtually all </p><p>instances importation of the material in question </p><p>eventually has been permitted." </p><p> </p><p>Reason: Moved to this location from location earlier in the </p><p>Section. </p><p> </p><p>41.  Please replace former paragraph 10 with the following </p><p>(Reason: Rewording and additional language.): </p><p> </p><p>"There is a dual system of Shari\'a (Islamic) courts for </p><p>criminal and family law matters and secular courts for </p><p>civil law matters.  Non-Muslims are tried for criminal </p><p>offenses in Shari\'a courts.  Not all crimes are punishable </p><p>by Shari\'a penalties.  In cases punishable by Shari\'a </p><p>penalty, non-Muslims may receive civil penalties at the </p><p>discretion of the judge, which generally occurs.  Shari\'a </p><p>penalties imposed on non-Muslims also may be overturned or </p><p>modified by a higher court." </p><p> </p><p>42.  In former paragraph 11, please add the following as </p><p>new sentence 2:  "Dubai has a special Shi\'a council to act </p><p>on matters pertaining to Shi\'a family law." </p><p> </p><p>43.  In former paragraph 11, former sentence 2, please </p><p>replace "marry non-Muslim women;" with "marry non-Muslim </p><p>women "of the book," that is Christian or Jewish women;". </p><p> </p><p>44.  In former paragraph 12, sentence 2, please replace </p><p>"schools" with "public schools". </p><p> </p><p>45.  In former paragraph 12, please delete the last </p><p>sentence. </p><p> </p><p>46.  In former paragraph 12, please add the following </p><p>sentences as new sentences 3 and 4: </p><p> </p><p>"Religious groups may, however, conduct religious </p><p>instruction for their members on their religious compounds, </p><p>and there are parochial schools operating in the country. </p><p>According to Article 84 of the Executive System of Private </p><p>Education, private schools found teaching subjects that </p><p>contravene Islam, defame any religion or contravene the </p><p>nation\'s ethics and beliefs may face penalties, including </p><p>closure." </p><p> </p><p>-- IMPROVEMENTS AND POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN RESPECT FOR </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p>47.  In paragraph 1, please replace sentence 1 with the </p><p>following: </p><p> </p><p>"In mid-2003, the Coptic Orthodox Church received </p><p>permission to build a church in Abu Dhabi.  Two new </p><p>churches also opened during the period covered by this </p><p>report -- in April 2003, a 1,000-plus capacity Coptic </p><p>Orthodox church and service facilities opened in Dubai, and </p><p>in October 2002, a 1,000-plus capacity Catholic Church and </p><p>hall opened in Fujeirah emirate." </p><p>48.  In paragraph 1, please add the following sentences </p><p>between former sentences 3 and 4:  "The Indian Orthodox </p><p>church opened in May 2003 in a public ceremony.  In early </p><p>2001, ground was broken in Jebel Ali for the construction </p><p>of several churches on a parcel of land donated by the </p><p>Government of Dubai to four Protestant congregations and a </p><p>Catholic congregation." </p><p> </p><p>49.  In paragraph 1, former sentence 4, please replace "A </p><p>Catholic church" with "The Catholic church". </p><p>50.  In paragraph 1, please add the following as the new </p><p>second to last sentence:  "In May 2001, the Crown Prince of </p><p>Dubai authorized the construction of a Greek Orthodox </p><p>church on donated land." </p><p>51.  In paragraph 1, last sentence, please replace "Also </p><p>during the period covered by the report," with "Also in </p><p>2001,". </p><p> </p><p>52.  Please add the following paragraphs as new paragraphs </p><p>2-5: </p><p> </p><p>"In April 2002, UAE President Shaykh Zayed bin Sultan Al </p><p>Nahyan announced that he would personally fund, through the </p><p>UAE Red Crescent Authority, the repair and restoration of </p><p>Bethlehem\'s Church of the Nativity and Omar mosque, both of </p><p>which were damaged during Israeli-Palestinian hostilities." </p><p> </p><p>"In June 2002, a Palestinian Greek Orthodox priest paid an </p><p>official visit to the UAE.  In February 2003, UAE Supreme </p><p>Council member and Ruler of Ajman Emirate received an </p><p>official visit from the Catholic Bishop to the Arabian </p><p>Peninsula.  Also in February 2003, the Coptic Archbishop of </p><p>Jerusalem and the Near East delivered a lecture on </p><p>religious tolerance at the Zayed Center for Coordination </p><p>and Follow-Up in Abu Dhabi.  In May, the Bishop of the </p><p>Delhi Dioceses was the chief celebrant at the public </p><p>consecration ceremony of the fifth Indian Orthodox church </p><p>in the UAE.  In July, the Zayed Center for Coordination and </p><p>Follow-Up hosted the Catholic Bishop to the Arabian </p><p>Peninsula, who spoke on religious tolerance in the UAE and </p><p>the importance of dialogue among religions." </p><p> </p><p>"In May 2002, the Council of Evangelical Churches hosted a </p><p>3-day public conference in Abu Dhabi, which featured an </p><p>internationally renowned Christian speaker, seminars, and </p><p>workshops, with events for adults and children.  Tickets to </p><p>the conference were available upon request." </p><p> </p><p>"Also in 2002, the Dubai Evangelical Church Center hosted a </p><p>youth event called "Desert Challenge" attended by adults </p><p>and children from six countries." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>SECTION III -- SOCIETAL ATTITUDES </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>53.  In the second to last sentence, please replace "they </p><p>are able to best limit unwanted foreign influence" with </p><p>"they can best balance foreign influence." </p><p> </p><p>54.  Please delete the last sentence. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>SECTION IV -- U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>55.  Please replace paragraph 2 with the following: </p><p> </p><p>"Embassy officials in Abu Dhabi and Consulate General </p><p>officials in Dubai have discussed religious tolerance and </p><p>freedom with UAE Government officials on a number of </p><p>occasions, and have encouraged the government to increase </p><p>religious freedom here by permitting the opening or </p><p>expansion of religious facilities for the large expatriate </p><p>population.  Embassy and consulate officials also help to </p><p>protect religious freedom by monitoring its status through </p><p>informal inquiries and meetings with UAE Government </p><p>officials and representatives of Muslim, Christian and </p><p>other faiths.  For example, Embassy and Consulate officials </p><p>closely monitored the criminal proceedings in 2002-2003 of </p><p>the evangelical Christian pastor arrested for </p><p>proselytizing, and the Consul General urged Dubai officials </p><p>to dispose of the case in a manner acceptable to all </p><p>parties involved." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
