<p>UNCLAS HANOI 001821 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/PD, AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT:  REDUCTION IN FATHER LY\'S SENTENCE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request -- see para 3. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Court officials in Ha Nam province on July 17 </p><p>confirmed media reports that the court had reduced the </p><p>cumulative 15 years sentences of Catholic Father Nguyen Van </p><p>Ly by five years in recognition of his "good behavior" in </p><p>prison.  Court officials confirmed that he was in a prison </p><p>in Ha Nam province and described him as an "obedient </p><p>prisoner."  They indicated that this reduction was a "normal </p><p>practice" that had not been specifically requested by Father </p><p>Ly or his relatives.  He will also remain subject to a five </p><p>year administrative detention order following his new </p><p>release date in 2011. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Comment:  The GVN clearly believes that it should </p><p>win international -- particularly, U.S. -- commendation for </p><p>this step, which shows how little senior GVN officials yet </p><p>understand the nature of our differences on human rights. </p><p>This reduction in sentence is a hollow and perhaps even </p><p>counter-productive gesture that will only remind the </p><p>international community and members of Congress of this </p><p>Catholic priest sentenced to 15 years in prison for nothing </p><p>more than speaking his mind.  We should be quite frank in </p><p>our calls for his release.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Suggested press guidance:  The five year reduction </p><p>in Father Nguyen Van Ly\'s 15 year sentences is a hollow </p><p>gesture, since he should never have been tried and </p><p>convicted.  The GVN should instead immediately release </p><p>Father Ly and all other prisoners who have done nothing more </p><p>than exercise their right to free speech and other basic </p><p>freedoms. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
