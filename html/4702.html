Mission\'s draft of the 2002 INSCR for Sri Lanka </p><p>follows.  Responses are keyed to questions in Ref B. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>I. Summary: </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka has a comparatively modest drug problem.  The </p><p>government maintains a solid counternarcotics record, </p><p>including a strong nation-wide demand reduction program. </p><p>The U.S. government has a close relationship with the </p><p>Sri Lankan government on counternarcotics issues. </p><p>Supported by the U.S. Embassy, efforts at public </p><p>education on drug abuse continued during the year.  The </p><p>country remained an effective regional player in </p><p>counternarcotics cooperation.  An ongoing ceasefire with </p><p>the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has enabled </p><p>the government to commit more officials to </p><p>counternarcotics efforts, thus strengthening Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>counternarcotics activities.  The government continued </p><p>to make available to other nations in the South Asian </p><p>Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) a U.S. </p><p>government-funded database on narcotics arrests and </p><p>related information.  Sri Lanka has signed the UN Drug </p><p>Convention, although Parliament still had not considered </p><p>the enabling legislation for the convention as of the </p><p>end of 2002. </p><p> </p><p>II.  Status of Country: </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka is not a major producer of narcotics or </p><p>precursor chemicals.  Some evidence exists that Sri </p><p>Lanka may be a transit point for a limited amount of </p><p>narcotics.  With respect to its domestic situation, Sri </p><p>Lanka has a modest drug problem with continued </p><p>consumption of heroin and cannabis. </p><p> </p><p>III. Country Action Against Drugs in 2002: </p><p> </p><p>-- Policy Initiatives:  In 2002, the Sri Lankan </p><p>government continued to maintain a good track record on </p><p>counternarcotics issues.  One primary change affecting </p><p>operations during 2002 was the December 2001 transfer of </p><p>jurisdiction of the police -- who are responsible for </p><p>counternarcotics and demand reduction activities -- from </p><p>the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of Interior. </p><p>The change in leadership coincided with a cessation of </p><p>hostilities with the LTTE and was implemented by the new </p><p>government elected on December 5, 2001.  During the 19- </p><p>year conflict with the LTTE, the police were often </p><p>called on to assist in prosecuting the war effort </p><p>against the LTTE.  This was clearly evident in the </p><p>decrease in personnel in police bureaus, including the </p><p>Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB).  The past year has seen </p><p>the PNB refocus on the Sri Lankan counternarcotics </p><p>masterplan drafted with the assistance of the UN Drug </p><p>Control Program (UNDCP) and initially implemented in </p><p>1994.  The PNB increased its staff from approximately </p><p>150 officers to just over 200.  With the cessation of </p><p>hostilities between the government and the LTTE, PNB </p><p>officers were able to focus on counternarcotics </p><p>investigations instead of being constantly pulled aside </p><p>for additional duties. </p><p>At the end of the year, the government had not yet </p><p>submitted to Parliament the comprehensive </p><p>counternarcotics legislative package drafted by the </p><p>National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB), the </p><p>government agency responsible for coordinating national </p><p>drug policies.  The proposed legislation was being </p><p>reviewed by the Attorney General\'s office at year\'s end. </p><p>During 2002, the NDDCB, in anticipation of the eventual </p><p>implementation of its legislative package, was </p><p>developing monitoring mechanisms for current and </p><p>upcoming counternarcotics legislation. </p><p> </p><p>-- Accomplishments:  In January 2001, the Sri Lankan </p><p>government signed an extradition treaty with the United </p><p>States.  Sri Lanka continued to work with SAARC on </p><p>regional narcotics issues. </p><p> </p><p>-- Law Enforcement Efforts:  The PNB, the Customs </p><p>Service, and the Department of Excise share </p><p>responsibility for discouraging cannabis production.  At </p><p>mid-year, the PNB was forecasting a reduction in the </p><p>annual seizure rate of narcotics.  At year\'s end, </p><p>however, a series of seizures, including approximately </p><p>20kg of heroin in November, dramatically increased the </p><p>total amount of narcotics seized. </p><p> </p><p>((NOTE:  At this time, the annual statistics on seizures </p><p>and arrests are not yet available from the Sri Lankan </p><p>government.  Per instructions in Ref B, Mission will </p><p>forward the statistics, as they become available.)) </p><p> </p><p>-- Corruption:  Although there were rumors (nothing </p><p>confirmed) of bribery of low-level government officials </p><p>by narcotics dealers in 2002, there was no evidence that </p><p>public officials engaged in narcotics trafficking.  In </p><p>one case a former police officer was arrested for </p><p>narcotics trafficking and was awaiting trial at year\'s </p><p>end.  In 1994, the government established a permanent </p><p>commission to investigate charges of bribery and </p><p>corruption against public officials.  No narcotics- </p><p>related corruption cases were reportedly reviewed by </p><p>this body during 2002. </p><p> </p><p>-- Agreements and Treaties:  Sri Lanka has signed the </p><p>1988 UN Drug Convention, and the 1990 SAARC convention </p><p>on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.  Enabling </p><p>legislation for both conventions, initially drafted by </p><p>the NDDCB in 1997, still had not reached Parliament at </p><p>year\'s end.  The Attorney General\'s office was reviewing </p><p>the legislation.  In January 2001, the Sri Lankan </p><p>government enacted a new extradition treaty with the </p><p>United States.  Sri Lanka has also signed the following </p><p>agreements:  World Customs Organization Convention; the </p><p>International Convention on Investigation and Repression </p><p>of Customs Offences (the Nairobi Convention); the Single </p><p>Convention on Narcotic Drugs, along with the 1972 </p><p>Protocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic </p><p>Drugs; and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substance </p><p>(signed in 1993). </p><p> </p><p>-- Cultivation and Production:  With respect to illicit </p><p>narcotic substances, Sri Lanka is only known to produce </p><p>cannabis, and Sri Lanka\'s production has little, if any, </p><p>effect on the United States.  Most cannabis cultivation </p><p>occurs in heavy jungle in the southeastern part of the </p><p>island, adjacent to previous areas of conflict.  The </p><p>police have an active program to find and destroy </p><p>cannabis crops. </p><p> </p><p>((NOTE:  At this time, the annual statistics on </p><p>eradication efforts are not yet available from the Sri </p><p>Lankan government.  Per instructions in Ref B, Mission </p><p>will forward the statistics, as they become available.)) </p><p> </p><p>-- Drug Flow/Transit:  Some heroin reportedly transits </p><p>Sri Lanka.  Unlike 2001, no major seizures occurred at </p><p>Colombo\'s international airport.  Customs officials and </p><p>the PNB suspect that narcotics are brought into Sri </p><p>Lanka by ship from India.  During 2002, India reported </p><p>large-scale seizures of heroin headed for Sri Lanka in </p><p>Chennai.  The PNB regularly stressed their country\'s </p><p>vulnerability to transshipment of heroin from India due </p><p>to Sri Lanka\'s long coastline.  Sri Lanka has no coast </p><p>guard and the primary operations of Sri Lanka\'s naval </p><p>vessels were in efforts to prevent the inflow of weapons </p><p>to the LTTE.  This lack of seagoing capability hinders </p><p>interdiction efforts. </p><p> </p><p>-- Domestic Programs:  The government has an excellent </p><p>record on demand reduction.  The NDDCB continued its </p><p>aggressive national public education campaign.  In </p><p>addition, the PNB in conjunction with NGOs, and after </p><p>U.S. government-funded training through the Colombo </p><p>Plan, initiated an anti-narcotics education campaign in </p><p>late 2002 in schools nation-wide.  The NDDCB, through </p><p>international and local funding, provides training on </p><p>prevention techniques and has established four free </p><p>treatment and rehabilitation centers in Sri Lanka.  The </p><p>courses offered by NDDCB are directed at judicial </p><p>officers, police officers, students, teachers, and </p><p>parents.  The Colombo Plan also continued extensive </p><p>rehabilitation and prevention training programs.  Until </p><p>2002, the Colombo Plan worked primarily with NGOs in Sri </p><p>Lanka.  Due to the ongoing ceasefire, the PNB has been </p><p>able to allocate more time to training for its personnel </p><p>and has worked with the Colombo Plan to expand the </p><p>police officers\' focus from only interdiction to include </p><p>prevention techniques. </p><p> </p><p>IV.  U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs: </p><p> </p><p>-- U.S. Policy Initiatives:  The U.S. government has a </p><p>close relationship with the Sri Lankan government on </p><p>counternarcotics issues.  In addition to providing </p><p>material and financial support, the U.S. Embassy in Sri </p><p>Lanka has participated actively in community awareness </p><p>seminars.  The U.S. government hopes to advance self- </p><p>sufficiency and co-operation among law enforcement and </p><p>other government officials working on narcotics issues </p><p>in Sri Lanka and the region.  In 2002, several PNB </p><p>officers participated in an Anti-Terrorist Assistance </p><p>training program in the United States and Sri Lanka. </p><p>The U.S. government is the principle contributor to the </p><p>Colombo Plan\'s Drug Advisory Program (DAP), providing </p><p>over USD 300,000 to the program in 2002.  The funding </p><p>was used to conduct regional and country-specific </p><p>training seminars with government and NGO </p><p>representatives on education, awareness, rehabilitation, </p><p>and prevention techniques.  The DAP also contributed </p><p>directly to awareness campaigns in Colombo. </p><p> </p><p>-- Bilateral Cooperation:  In previous years, the U.S. </p><p>government assisted several Sri Lankan organizations in </p><p>their counternarcotics efforts.  In 1998, the U.S. </p><p>government provided close to USD 7,000 for equipment </p><p>purchases to the NDDCB, the Federation of Non- </p><p>Governmental Organizations Against Drug Abuse </p><p>(FONGOADA), and the Sri Lanka Anti-Narcotics </p><p>Association.  In August 2000, more than 30 participants </p><p>from narcotics enforcement agencies in four countries </p><p>attended an anti-narcotics investigative techniques </p><p>course in Colombo funded by the U.S. government and </p><p>conducted by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).  In </p><p>2002, the U.S. continued to provide training to the Sri </p><p>Lankan government.  In December, for example, the DEA </p><p>conducted a training program on airport interdiction </p><p>techniques for 26 participants from Sri Lanka and four </p><p>participants from the Maldives. </p><p> </p><p>-- Road Ahead:  The U.S. government will continue to </p><p>work with Sri Lankan counternarcotics organizations </p><p>whenever possible, particularly by speaking at or </p><p>otherwise participating in seminars addressing the drug </p><p>problem.  The overall level of U.S. counternarcotics </p><p>assistance to Sri Lanka is expected to incrementally </p><p>increase in 2003.  The U.S. expects to continue its </p><p>support of the Colombo Plan, and already has agreements </p><p>to conduct additional training with the PNB and other </p><p>government officials involved in counternarcotics </p><p>efforts. </p><p>V.  Statistical Tables: </p><p> </p><p>((NOTE:  At this time, the annual statistics on </p><p>eradication efforts are not yet available from the Sri </p><p>Lankan government.  Per instructions in Ref B, Mission </p><p>will forward the statistics, as they become available.)) </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>======== </p><p>MALDIVES </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>3.  Mission\'s draft of the 2002 INSCR for the Maldives </p><p>follows. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>The Maldives is not a major producer of narcotics or </p><p>precursor chemicals.  No concrete evidence exists that </p><p>the Maldives is a transit point for narcotics.  Some </p><p>Maldivian officials believe their country may become a </p><p>transshipment point, however. </p><p> </p><p>Consisting of approximately 1,100 islands set in the </p><p>Indian Ocean, and with a population of approximately </p><p>270,000, the Republic of the Maldives has a </p><p>comparatively small drug problem that appears to be </p><p>growing.  The government is aware of the problem and is </p><p>fully cooperative with the U.S. on counternarcotic </p><p>issues.  The fact that children under 16 constitute </p><p>about 50 percent of the population makes police and UNDP </p><p>officials wary of the high growth potential for drug use </p><p>in the country.  Nonetheless, the police believe they </p><p>can control the sale of drugs on the streets of the </p><p>capital and most populated city, Male.  Police officials </p><p>believe that some of the country\'s approximately 25,000 </p><p>foreign workers, mainly Indians and Sri Lankans who work </p><p>in the country\'s resorts, conduct most of the </p><p>trafficking, which is believed to be limited. </p><p> </p><p>Although there is no evidence yet to indicate that the </p><p>Maldives is a transshipment point at this time, </p><p>international observers and some government officials </p><p>fear that the Maldives has the potential to become a </p><p>transshipment point for smugglers.  Most drugs are </p><p>believed to come into the country by sea, but the </p><p>Customs Service and police find it impossible to search </p><p>all ships adequately.  In late 2002, the government </p><p>participated in training with Sri Lanka on using drug </p><p>sniffing dogs to help search vessels. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. has assisted the Maldives in counternarcotics </p><p>activities, including via direct training or through the </p><p>Colombo Plan.  With U.S. government funding, the </p><p>Maldivian government began to computerize its </p><p>immigration record-keeping system in 1993 in an attempt, </p><p>among other purposes, to track the movements of </p><p>suspected drug traffickers.  Starting in 1996 the U.S. </p><p>has contributed USD 33,000 to implement and then expand </p><p>this computer system. </p><p> </p><p>In November 1997, the Maldivian government established a </p><p>Narcotics Control Board (NCB) under the Executive Office </p><p>of the President.  The Board\'s Commissioner, a military </p><p>officer, has concurrent duties in the Maldivian National </p><p>Security Service.  The NCB principally overseas </p><p>rehabilitation of addicts, and co-ordinates the efforts </p><p>of NGOs and other individuals engaged in </p><p>counternarcotics activities.  He also co-ordinates drug </p><p>interdiction activities. </p><p> </p><p>In 1997, the government established the country\'s first </p><p>drug rehabilitation center with space for several dozen </p><p>clients.  With the expansion of the rehabilitation </p><p>program, and a move to the land previously occupied by </p><p>the national prison, the center now houses up to 300 </p><p>clients at any one time.  The center cannot keep pace </p><p>with the number of people ordered to undergo </p><p>rehabilitation, however.  At times there are as many </p><p>people under house arrest and awaiting a position in the </p><p>camp, as there are individuals undergoing treatment.  In </p><p>addition to the camp, the NCB has established a </p><p>continuing prevention program designed to prevent </p><p>relapse.  The government also launched an ongoing drug </p><p>awareness campaign in 1998.  In conjunction with the </p><p>national effort, the government sent teams to 11 of the </p><p>19 atolls to conduct awareness campaigns and to assist </p><p>in drug detection. </p><p> </p><p>The Republic of the Maldives has no extradition treaty </p><p>with the United States.  In 1994, however, the Maldives </p><p>cooperated with the U.S. in rendering a Nigerian </p><p>national to the United States to face narcotics </p><p>trafficking charges.  The Maldivian government has </p><p>signed the 1988 UN Convention.  The South Asian </p><p>Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Convention </p><p>on Narcotic Drugs came into force in the Maldives in </p><p>1993. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
