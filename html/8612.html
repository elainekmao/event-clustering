<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000682 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND DRL </p><p>USMISSION NEW YORK FOR AMBASSADOR TWINING </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, BM, ASSK, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: SPDC STRIKES CONCILIATORY TONE IN SECOND BRIEFING </p><p>ON MAY 30 AMBUSH </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 0647 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  In a June 10 briefing for journalists and </p><p>diplomats following UN Special Envoy Razali\'s departure from </p><p>Rangoon, the Foreign Ministry provided more details of the </p><p>May 30 ambush of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s (ASSK) motorcade near </p><p>Depeyin and side-pedaled on several issues connected to the </p><p>attack.  Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win announced </p><p>that an official inquest by the Ministry of Home Affairs is </p><p>underway and more details would be forthcoming.  The COM </p><p>again requested a full accounting of the injured, dead and </p><p>detained.  She also expressed the expectation that the SPDC </p><p>would not merely return to the status quo ante May 30 but </p><p>would take concrete steps forward on the path of national </p><p>reconciliation. This briefing was unexpectedly conciliatory </p><p>indicating that the government is on notice that the issue is </p><p>bigger than access to ASSK and the NLD members - they must </p><p>try to build some credibility, quickly, if they expect anyone </p><p>to believe their "commitment to national reconciliation." </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DeputyFonMin (DFM) Khin Maung Win reiterated that the </p><p>SPDC regarded the events of May 30 as "most unfortunate" and </p><p>that the "safe custody" measures for ASSK are temporary and </p><p>will be lifted "as soon as the situation returns to normal." </p><p>He said Special Envoy Razali was granted the "special </p><p>gesture" of a meeting with ASSK for two reasons:  to show </p><p>their continuing cooperation with the United Nations, and </p><p>because of the SPDC\'s trust in confidence in Mr. Razali </p><p>himself. </p><p> </p><p>3.  He announced that the Ministry of Home Affairs had opened </p><p>an official inquest into the May 30 "incident."  Preliminary </p><p>investigations show that violence erupted when ASSK\'s convoy </p><p>attempted to "plow through a crowd blocking the road."  He </p><p>made much out of the fact that this occurred late at night in </p><p>"an area with no public lighting, there was much confusion, </p><p>and things got out of hand."  (Note:  The government appears </p><p>to be developing a new approach to describing the situation. </p><p>Unlike the tone of certainty accompanying the statements of </p><p>the last press briefing - "There were 5000 people gathered. </p><p>...  There were no military or police present at the time of </p><p>the attack. ...  Only fifty were injured. ... No arrests were </p><p>made - the government is emphasizing uncertainty, the </p><p>confusion and dark, and that the inquest is "ongoing" and </p><p>more details may yet be uncovered.  It gives them more leeway </p><p>to retract or contradict statements made earlier.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DFM "clarified" several statements made at the June 3 </p><p>briefing (Reftel).  He was careful to say, instead of "50 </p><p>injured" that 48 people presented themselves at the hospital </p><p>for treatment, leaving the possibility that there were more </p><p>injured who did not.  In response to a question about </p><p>arrests, he said that no one had been "arrested per se" but </p><p>that, "as they say in the British newspapers, several people </p><p>are helping us with our inquiries." </p><p> </p><p>5.  He reiterated that both Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo were </p><p>not hurt in what the SPDC is now calling "a melee" instead of </p><p>an "incident." </p><p> </p><p>6.  Diplomats present reiterated their desire to have access </p><p>to ASSK and Tin Oo.  The COM requested that the government </p><p>provide a full accounting, including names of the dead and </p><p>injured at the scene.  The DFM replied that he would try to </p><p>comply.  She also expressed the expectation that SPDC would </p><p>demonstrate their stated commitment to the national </p><p>reconciliation process not merely by releasing ASSK and other </p><p>detainees and reopening the NLD offices, but going forward </p><p>with concrete steps to bring about national reconciliation. </p><p>The DFM said he shared that sentiment, as "we do not want to </p><p>return to confrontation." </p><p> </p><p>7.  Comment:  This briefing was unexpectedly conciliatory. </p><p>However, the assembled dip corps expressed disappointment </p><p>that the government continues to stonewall on the issue of </p><p>access to ASSK and the NLD leadership, and on the issue of </p><p>the conditions and location of their detention.  But it </p><p>appears that the government is starting to realize that </p><p>attacking and accusing the NLD of provoking the clash, or </p><p>claiming an international smear campaign against the SPDC, </p><p>won\'t wash. They are also on notice that the issue is bigger </p><p>than access to ASSK and the NLD members - they must try to </p><p>build some credibility, quickly, if they expect anyone to </p><p>believe their "commitment to national reconciliation".  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
