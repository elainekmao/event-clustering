WE NOW HAVE A CLEARER PICTURE, IN PART BASED </p><p>ON EYE-WITNESS REPORTS, OF THE KILLINGS THAT TOOK </p><p>PLACE AT THE ANIMAL MARKET IN NORTHEAST MOGADISHU </p><p>ON DECEMBER 6 (REFTEL).

A BYSTANDER ON A MOTOR SCOOTER FOLLOWED THE </p><p>PICK-UP TRUCK UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE </p><p>GARRISON OF THE 77TH MILITARY SECTOR.  BACK AT THE </p><p>SCENE OF  THE SHOOTING, POLICE ARRIVED AND ARRESTED </p><p>THE MEN WHO HAD FIRED ON THE SOLDIERS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  AN FSN\'S SISTER, WHO LIVES NEAR THE MARKET,  SAYS </p><p>SHE COUNTED 12 DEAD BODIES, AND THAT TWO OTHERS DIED </p><p>LATER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND AN ADDITIONAL THREE </p><p>AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  RADIO MOGADISHU REPORTED ON DECEMBER 6 THAT </p><p>TEN PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED BY "BANDITS" AT THE </p><p>ANIMAL MARKET, AND THAT THREE SUSPECTS HAD BEEN </p><p>ARRESTED.  ON DECEMBER 7, HOWEVER, RADIO MOGADISHU </p><p>REVISED ITS ESTIMATE, "AFTER LONG INVESTIGATIONS," </p><p>TO TWO DEAD AND FOUR WOUNDED. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.

IN THIS MEETING, MORGAN </p><p>IS SAID TO HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PERPETRATORS </p><p>WERE GALGALA AND MAREHAN MEMBERS OF THE 77TH SECTOR </p><p>GARRISON.  HE PROMISED TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE, </p><p>AND BLAMED THE SOLDIERS\' BEHAVIOR ON THE TONE </p><p>SET BY HIS PREDECESSOR, GENERAL ABDURAHMAN MOHAMED </p><p>SAID "MASLAH."  HE DID NOT SAY THAT THE GUILTY </p><p>SOLDIERS HAD BEEN OR WOULD BE ARRESTED, HOWEVER. </p><p>ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACT, THE ELDERS WERE IMPRESSED </p><p>BY MORGAN AND WERE WILLING TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE ARMY\'S BEHAVIOR TOWARD CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7.
