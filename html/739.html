(C) A RECENT GOVERNMENT REPORT PROVIDED SOME LONG- </p><p>AWAITED STATISTICS ON DETAINEES, KIA, AND CIVILIANS </p><p>FROM THE MAY 1-2 SECTOR WEST BATTLES.  IT APPEARS, </p><p>HOWEVER, STILL TO LEAVE OPEN QUESTIONS FOR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND FOR THE AREA\'S SERB </p><p>POPULATION.  THE MAIN CASUALTY OF THE GOC\'S INADEQUATE </p><p>AND UNTIMELY EFFORTS TO PROVIDE NUMBERS ON CASUALTIES </p><p>AND REFUGEES IS THUS, IRONICALLY, ITS OWN CREDIBILITY. </p><p>END SUMMARYCOMMENT. </p><p>- </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>GOC ISSUES A STATISTICAL REPORT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ON MAY 22, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER KOSTOVIC </p><p>RELEASED A STATEMENT CONTAINING STATISTICAL INFORMATION </p><p>ON PEOPLE IN SECTOR WEST AFFECTED BY THE MAY 1-2 WAR </p><p>THERE.  THE RELEASE OFFERS THE FOLLOWING DATA: </p><p> </p><p>-- A "CENSUS" TAKEN APPARENTLY ON MAY 4 SHOWED 2922 </p><p>CIVILIANS REMAINING AROUND PAKRAC AND ABOUT 500 TOTAL </p><p>IN OKUCANI, STARA GRADISKA, AND JASENOVAC. </p><p> </p><p>-- BETWEEN MAY 8 AND 19, 1719 PEOPLE LEFT AND WENT TO </p><p>B-H.  6-7000 CIVILIANS WERE ESTIMATED TO HAVE FLED THE </p><p>AREA AHEAD OF THE ADVANCING TROOPS.  OF THE REMAINING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02007  01 OF 02  241545Z </p><p>SERB POPULATION, 675 HAVE BEEN GRANTED CROATIAN </p><p>CITIZENSHIP CERTIFICATES; 1070 HAVE APPLIED FOR SUCH </p><p>CERTIFICATES. </p><p> </p><p>-- 188 BODIES WERE FOUND AFTER THE FIGHTING.  127 OF </p><p>THESE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.  20 IDENTIFIED AS CIVILIANS </p><p>WERE KILLED "IN CROSSFIRE CAUSED BY PARAMILITARY </p><p>UNITS," AS WERE ANOTHER 34 WHO "ARE ASSUMED POSSIBLY </p><p>NOT TO HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF PARAMILITARY UNITS."  THESE </p><p>BODIES WERE BURIED "IN SEVERAL GRAVES" BY RELEVANT </p><p>AUTHORITIES; RELATIVES MAY MAKE INDIVIDUAL INQUIRIES TO </p><p>THE CROATIAN RED CROSS. </p><p> </p><p>-- 1494 "MILITARILY CAPABLE" MEN WERE PROCESSED IN </p><p>"RECEPTION CENTERS."  917 OF THESE WERE RELEASED </p><p>WITHOUT INITIATION OF INVESTIGATORY PROCESS.  OF THE </p><p>REMAINDER WHO WERE INVESTIGATED, 188 ARE STILL BEING </p><p>HELD IN "INVESTIGATION CENTERS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>DATA LEAVES MANY OPEN QUESTIONS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (LOU) THE GOVERNMENT\'S "REPORT" AT LEAST DEFINES </p><p>THE PARAMETERS, BUT IT LEAVES OPEN AS MANY QUESTIONS AS </p><p>IT ANSWERS.  WE NOTE THE FOLLOWING SHORTCOMINGS: </p><p>-- NO FIGURE IS PROVIDED FOR WOUNDED-IN-ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE HOW MANY CIVILIANS </p><p>REMAIN IN THE AREA, AS THE TOTAL ATTRIBUTED TO A MAY 4 </p><p>RED CROSS CENSUS (3422) CANNOT BE SQUARED WITH THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02007  01 OF 02  241545Z </p><p>(APPARENTLY LATER) CUMULATIVE FIGURES FOR THOSE WHO </p><p>LEFT (1719) AND THOSE WHO REMAIN (POSSIBLY 1745). </p><p> </p><p>-- THE FIGURES ON DETAINEES LEAVE AN ADDITIONAL 391 </p><p>PERSONS UNACCOUNTED FOR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN A CONVERSATION MAY 23 WITH ASSISTANT </p><p>MINISTER OF INTERIOR FOR POLICE JOSKO MORIC, POLOFFS </p><p>(WHO AT THE TIME HAD ONLY PRESS ACCOUNTS OF THE </p><p>"REPORT") ASKED MORIC ABOUT THE LAST DISCREPANCY </p><p>ESPECIALLY.  HE CLAIMED THE MATTER WAS PROBABLY UNCLEAR </p><p>"BECAUSE OF INCOMPLETE MEDIA TRANSCRIPTION" (COMMENT: </p><p>ON OUR RETURN TO ZAGREB WE FOUND THE PRESS ACCOUNT WAS </p><p>A FULL RENDERING OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S PRESS RELEASE, AND </p><p>NO MORE COMPLETE REPORT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE UN.) </p><p>MORIC SAID THE NUMBER NOT ACCOUNTED FOR REPRESENTED </p><p>PERSONS NOT CHARGED WITH WAR CRIMES BUT OTHER "NORMAL" </p><p>CRIMES SUCH AS THEFT.  (COMMENT: IF SO, THIS WOULD </p><p>VIOLATE THE SPIRIT AND LETTER OF THE GOC\'S AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH THE UN.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ4024 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4024 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02007  02 OF 02  241545Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  OASY-00  DODE-00  EB-01 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-08    L-01     ADS-00   M-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01 </p><p>      P-01     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   PRME-01  DRL-09   G-00       /029W </p><p>                  ------------------C8F704  241545Z /38 </p><p>P 241636Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5900 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 002007 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA; USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  5/24/00 </p><p>TAGS:  PNAT PHUM HR </p><p>SUBJECT:  WESTERN SLAVONIA: INFORMATION GAP, PART I </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02007  02 OF 02  241545Z </p><p> </p><p>CREDIBILITY IS A PROBLEM </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.

SP </p><p>ECIFIC POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- MORIC ALSO CLAIMED FULL REPORTS, INCLUDING LISTS OF </p><p>THE NAMES OF DEAD, DETAINEES, AND OTHERS, HAD BEEN </p><p>PROVIDED TO THE ICRC AND UN.  WE FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>AS OF MIDDAY MAY 23, NEITHER ICRC NOR UN OFFICIALS IN </p><p>WESTERN SLAVONIA OR ZAGREB HAD ANYTHING BUT THE PRESS </p><p>RELEASE SUMMARIZED ABOVE.  (ICRC PEOPLE MAKING THE </p><p>ROUNDS OF KEY SERBS IN PAKRAC AREA MAY 23 HAD ONLY THE </p><p>LIST THAT THE HEAD OF THE BJELOVAR DETENTION CENTER HAD </p><p>GIVEN U.S. POLOFFS MAY 18). </p><p> </p><p>-- THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE THE </p><p>NUMBER OF KIA (188) IN THIS REPORT WITH THE MUCH LARGER </p><p>NUMBER (450) CITED A WEEK AGO BY DEFMIN SUSAK. </p><p>ALTHOUGH SUSAK\'S STAFF TOLD DATT HE PULLED THAT FIGURE </p><p>OUT OF THIN AIR, IT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND OUGHT </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  (WESTERN SLAVONIA </p><p>SERB LEADER VELJKO DZAKULA, TO WHOM WE SHOWED THE </p><p>NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT OF THE REPORT, PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY </p><p>ON THIS DISCREPANCY, OFFERING IT AS EVIDENCE THAT THE </p><p>GOC WAS HIDING SOMETHING.) </p><p> </p><p>-- THE GOC ATTEMPTS TO BLAME ALL THE CIVILIAN DEATHS ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02007  02 OF 02  241545Z </p><p>"PARAMILITARY UNITS," I.E., THE SERBS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE REFERENCE TO BURIAL OF THE DEAD IN "SEVERAL </p><p>GRAVES" MAY -- OR MAY NOT -- EXPLAIN RECENT PRESS </p><p>REPORTS OF "MASS GRAVES" IN OKUCANI AND ELSEWHERE.
