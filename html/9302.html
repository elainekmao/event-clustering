<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001408 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   President George W. Bush\'s remarks on the challenges </p><p>      facing Zimbabwe during a joint news conference with </p><p>      his South African counterpart, Thabo Mbeki, in </p><p>      Pretoria made the top story during the state-run </p><p>      radio and television, ZBC/TV, news programs </p><p>      broadcast on July 9 at 2000 hours.  The reporter </p><p>      aired sound bites from the two Presidents that </p><p>      centered on their shared position on how the </p><p>      political, economic and social turbulence in </p><p>      Zimbabwe could be resolved.  This news clip was </p><p>      followed by another clip about an anti-Bush protest </p><p>      that declared him a dangerous warmonger.  However, </p><p>      the station remained tight-lipped about another </p><p>      demonstration by about 100 supporters of the </p><p>      Movement for Democratic Change that waved placards, </p><p>      outside the U. S. Embassy in Pretoria, praising Bush </p><p>      for taking a tough line on Robert Mugabe. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Armed with the same story and a statement from </p><p>      Information Minister Jonathan Moyo\'s office, the </p><p>      July 10 editions of the two government-controlled </p><p>      dailies - "The Herald" and "Chronicle" - smiled all </p><p>      the way to the printers to run the following </p><p>      articles: </p><p> </p><p>      "Under headline "Bush shocks MDC" the "Herald" </p><p>      (07/10) carried the following articles under sub- </p><p>      headlines: </p><p> </p><p>      "U. S. President agrees with Mbeki on Zim" Itayi </p><p>      Musengeyi in Pretoria, South Africa reports: </p><p> </p><p>      "United States President George Bush has snubbed an </p><p>      MDC petition calling South African President Thabo </p><p>      Mbeki a `dishonest broker\' and urging the American </p><p>      Government to effect a `regime change\' in Zimbabwe. </p><p>      Speaking at a Press conference after meeting </p><p>      President Mbeki in Pretoria yesterday, the American </p><p>      President said he was of `one mind\' with his South </p><p>      African counterpart\'s approach to the Zimbabwean </p><p>      situation. . .Mr. Bush told reporters that he did </p><p>      not doubt the South African leader\'s capabilities as </p><p>      a mediator and that America supported him all the </p><p>      way.  In an apparent climb-down from recent </p><p>      pronouncements that the U. S. would ask South Africa </p><p>      to pressure Zimbabwe to hold fresh presidential </p><p>      elections, Mr. Bush said he was convinced President </p><p>      Mbeki was working hard to help Harare resolve its </p><p>      problems.  The U. S. leader also said Mr. Mbeki was </p><p>      an honest broker on the Zimbabwean issue. . ." </p><p> </p><p>      Under headline "Opposition party\'s antics laughable </p><p>      and childish" the "Herald" (07/10) carried the </p><p>      following article on page one: </p><p> </p><p>      "The British-sponsored MDC\'s predictable antics </p><p>      meant to catch the eye of U. S. President George W. </p><p>      Bush are vain, laughable and childish and can only </p><p>      confirm the MDC\'s infamous status as a puppet </p><p>      organization set up to protect and advance white </p><p>      interests, the Department of Information and </p><p>      Publicity in the President\'s Office said in a </p><p>      statement yesterday.  `No amount of falsehoods or </p><p>      sonorous verbiage can take away the fundamental </p><p>      truth that Zimbabwe today is a victim of her quest </p><p>      for genuine independence, democratic and full </p><p>      sovereign right over her resources, principally </p><p>      land.  Everything else is extraneous. . .\'  The </p><p>      department said President Bush\'s fleeting and </p><p>      perfunctory reference to Zimbabwe at his Press </p><p>      Conference is a loud climb-down by a President all </p><p>      along misled, but who now leaves the region better </p><p>      enlightened about issues at stake. . .\'The U. S. has </p><p>      also had to accept that Zimbabwe savors full and </p><p>      untrammeled sovereignty and thus will not accept </p><p>      false and synthetic solutions from outsiders however </p><p>      powerful.  The long and bloody years of independence </p><p>      struggle against white settler occupation have given </p><p>      this region a unique political trait which Bush </p><p>      cannot ignore, let alone contradict,\' the statement </p><p>      read. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   While the government-controlled press was gleefully </p><p>      reporting on the press conference, the independent </p><p>      daily "The Daily News" (07/10) settled on amplifying </p><p>      opposition MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai\'s message to </p><p>      Presidents Bush and Mbeki.  The paper carried the </p><p>      story on page two under headline "Tsvangirai </p><p>      welcomes U. S. commitment to end crisis."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      "Opposition MDC president Morgan Tsvangirai </p><p>      yesterday said he had welcomed commitment by </p><p>      American President George Bush and his South African </p><p>      counterpart Thabo Mbeki to seek an urgent end to </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s crisis but the opposition leader insisted </p><p>      there was no dialogue yet between his party and the </p><p>      ruling ZANU PF party as claimed by Mbeki. . .`We are </p><p>      encouraged by the statements of President Thabo </p><p>      Mbeki . . .and President George W. Bush. . .that </p><p>      there has been a meeting of minds between the two </p><p>      presidents on the Zimbabwe crisis. . . . \'" </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
