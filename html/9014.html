<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001474 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, PGOV, ECON, HR, BK, Refugee </p><p>SUBJECT: GOC APPROVES HOUSING MEASURES AIMED AT </p><p>FACILITATING REFUGEE RETURNS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) STATE 96439 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) ZAGREB 1084 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Darren Taylor, Political Officer, For Reasons: 1.5 (B) a </p><p>nd (D). </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In what is being viewed as an abrupt change of policy, </p><p>the Croatian Government on June 12 finally approved measures </p><p>aimed at providing subsidized housing to refugees who enjoyed </p><p>"tenancy rights" under the old Yugoslav system.  In another </p><p>development, Prime Minister Racan, for the first time, </p><p>publicly called for all refugees to return to Croatia.  The </p><p>GOC,s pursuit of EU membership -- and the EU,s linkage of </p><p>progress on return-related issues as a condition for </p><p>membership -- is the driving force behind recent GOC actions. </p><p> The proof will be in the implementation.  Senior GOC </p><p>officials, unfortunately, are already declaring the mission </p><p>accomplished -- characteristically confusing statements of </p><p>intention with implementation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>What A Difference A Day Makes </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) After three years of ignoring, rebuffing and attacking </p><p>IC insistence that it address the issue of lost </p><p>occupancy/tenancy rights (OTR) affecting the ability of tens </p><p>of thousands of refugees to return to Croatia, the SDP-led </p><p>coalition Racan government on June 12 dramatically reversed </p><p>its previous policy and announced a new initiative to provide </p><p>housing assistance to refugees who had enjoyed OTR and who </p><p>want to return.  The government previously insisted that OTR </p><p>had been abolished as a legal instrument in Croatia and </p><p>therefore that no effort would be made to offer any special </p><p>assistance (never mind compensation) to the tens of thousands </p><p>of refugees -- by one estimate, up to 100,000 ethnic Serbs -- </p><p>who lost OTR when Croatia\'s law was changed after they had </p><p>fled Croatia, often under duress, in the mid-nineties. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Following Cabinet approval of the new initiative, </p><p>Prime Minister Racan took center stage and publicly welcomed </p><p>refugees to return to Croatia during a nationwide television </p><p>broadcast.  (Racan had rejected making such a public appeal </p><p>ever since entering office in early 2000, citing domestic </p><p>political considerations.)  In this first-ever public, </p><p>personal invitation, Racan told the TV audience that, by </p><p>adopting the housing program, the GOC had removed a key </p><p>political obstacle to EU membership.  "Housing is no longer </p><p>an obstacle for refugees seeking to return to Croatia,8 he </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p>GOC Highlights Housing Policy </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In their public announcements and in a presentation to </p><p>the Zagreb diplomatic corps, GOC officials described the new </p><p>initiative as an effort to facilitate the return of refugees, </p><p>not restore OTR to all individuals and families who lost </p><p>them.  Under the new housing plan, which the GOC promised to </p><p>begin implementing within 30 days, there will be two options </p><p>for potential returnees. </p><p> </p><p>--  Subsidized rent of state-owned apartments.  Under this </p><p>program, returnees would be eligible to receive subsidized </p><p>rent (less than one dollar per square meter) for apartments </p><p>that will be bought by the State or built through the </p><p>state-subsidized housing program. </p><p> </p><p>--  Direct purchase of property.  Refugees who are </p><p>financially able to pay the down payment (usually 10-30 </p><p>percent of the actual cost of a home or apartment) will </p><p>receive low interest rate loans under the program. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) GOC officials stressed that only former OTR holders </p><p>who seek to return to Croatia and who do not own homes in </p><p>Croatia or any of the former Yugoslav republics will be </p><p>eligible to participate in the program.  The program will </p><p>include cities both inside and outside of the war-affected </p><p>areas (so-called "Areas of Special State Concern").  The GOC </p><p>said it plans to spend USD 70 million toward the effort next </p><p>year and complete the reconstruction program by 2006. </p><p>Roughly half of this amount will come from the state budget. </p><p>Both Deputy PM Linic and Deputy FM Simonovic assured the </p><p>Ambassador that funds have been reserved for this program. </p><p>The GOC plans to apply for loans from the Council of Europe </p><p>Bank to cover the remaining balance. </p><p> </p><p>EU Membership Driving Force Behind GOC Action </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The EU,s decision to link Croatia,s progress on </p><p>refugee returns to its eventual membership in the EU is </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>driving the GOC effort.  In its March report, the EC </p><p>Commission specifically set a benchmark for the GOC:  to </p><p>develop and implement an acceptable plan to restore OTR for </p><p>those who lost such rights after fleeing during the war.  The </p><p>Commission gave the GOC until the end of the year to show </p><p>measurable progress on this and two other key impediments to </p><p>return: property restitution and processing applications for </p><p>reconstruction assistance.  The clear message was that the </p><p>GOC must act to enable and facilitate minority returns or </p><p>face a negative avis next spring on its EU membership </p><p>application.  The linkage is the only powerful lever </p><p>available to the IC to force the GOC to take what it </p><p>considers unpopular and costly steps to facilitate mostly </p><p>Serb returns.  Early signs are that the GOC is bending under </p><p>this EU pressure, which the USG has both spurred and </p><p>endorsed. </p><p> </p><p>No Time to Celebrate </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The GOC has a history of making promises and not </p><p>following through.  The Ambassador has underscored that we </p><p>will be looking at implementation as the true test of the </p><p>government\'s commitment -- a message he conveyed again to the </p><p>Prime Minister on June 26.  Whether or not the GOC fully </p><p>implements the program just announced will send a clear </p><p>signal about its readiness to "clear the hurdle" on refugee </p><p>returns.  While the GOC appears to have gotten the message </p><p>from the EU that resolving refugee returns will weigh heavily </p><p>on Croatia,s bid for membership, the same holds true for </p><p>NATO membership -- a point which the Croatians need to be </p><p>reminded of at every opportunity (Ref). </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Finally, despite the rather celebratory spirit </p><p>displayed by many GOC officials over the recent initiative, </p><p>another cloud hangs over Croatia: the case a former tenancy </p><p>right holder brought to the European Court of Human Rights in </p><p>Strasbourg.  Scores of other similar cases loom too.  The GOC </p><p>could be on the hook to compensate -- at enormous cost -- all </p><p>former tenancy rights holders, not just those who return to </p><p>Croatia to live.  Indeed, the proposed GOC program is not a </p><p>final resolution to the issue of OTR.  The EU holds that </p><p>rulings by the Strasbourg court must be respected -- a </p><p>central obligation of any country which aspires to EU </p><p>membership.  The OSCE is also following these cases closely. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
