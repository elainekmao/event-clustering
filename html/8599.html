<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001629 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/TPP/BTA/EWH MKEHOE </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR SCHANDLER AND ASTEPHENS </p><p>USDOC FOR 4320/ITA/MAC/JBENDER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA CUSTOMS\' DUMPING INVESTIGATION COULD IMPACT </p><p>U.S. STEEL EXPORTERS, BUT NOT MANUFACTURERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) has initiated an </p><p>investigation into the alleged injurious dumping of steel </p><p>structural tubing, known as hollow structural sections, </p><p>originating in, or exported from Korea, South Africa and </p><p>Turkey.  The investigation covers hollow structural sections </p><p>made of carbon and alloy steel, welded, in sizes up to and </p><p>including 16 inches in outside diameter for round products </p><p>and up to and including 48 inches in periphery for </p><p>rectangular and square products.  Although the investigation </p><p>does not include U.S. manufacturers, CCRA has informed post </p><p>that some of the goods subject to the investigation have been </p><p>sold to importers in Canada by exporters located in the U.S. </p><p>A complete list of the U.S. exporters is provided in </p><p>paragraph four. </p><p> </p><p>2. Three Canadian Manufacturers filed a complaint alleging </p><p>that the dumping of steel structural tubing has caused or is </p><p>threatening to cause injury to the companies\' production of </p><p>hollow structural section in Canada.  According to figures </p><p>contained in the complaint, imports from Korea, South Africa </p><p>and Turkey rose from approximately 8,800 tonnes in 2001 to </p><p>approximately 32,000 tonnes in 2002.  CCRA will conduct an </p><p>investigation to determine whether the subject goods imported </p><p>into Canada during the period of April 1, 2002, to March 31, </p><p>2003, have been dumped.  The Canadian International Trade </p><p>Tribunal (CITT) will conduct a preliminary inquiry to </p><p>determine if there is evidence that discloses a reasonable </p><p>indication that the dumping has caused or is threatening to </p><p>cause injury to the Canadian industry.  Details on the </p><p>investigation can be found at by clicking on "Statements of </p><p>Reasons" at www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/sima. </p><p> </p><p>3. From customs import documentation, the CCRA has identified </p><p>24 exporters of the subject goods, ten of which are based in </p><p>the U.S.  As a part of the investigation, CCRA has requested </p><p>information from exporters to determine the normal value and </p><p>the export price of the goods shipped to Canada.  Exporters </p><p>have until June 29, 2002 to respond to CCRA\'s request for </p><p>information.  CCRA\'s manager for the Industrial Products </p><p>Division Jim Gove told econoff that a failure to respond to </p><p>CCRA\'s request for information will lead to a likely less </p><p>favorable Anti-dumping determination than companies which </p><p>provide detailed information.  According to Gove, U.S. </p><p>exporters are not the major exporters of hollow structural </p><p>sections to Canada.  Sales figures from U.S. companies </p><p>indicate exports to Canada are sideline operations of </p><p>businesses that are primarily focused on the U.S. market. </p><p>Because of this, Gove did not expect many of the U.S. </p><p>exporters to provide the requested information. </p><p> </p><p>4. U.S. Exporters of structural tubing from the U.S. to </p><p>Canada include: </p><p> </p><p>- American Steel Inc., 19022 - 80th Avenue South, Kent, </p><p>Washington, 98032 </p><p>- Atlas Tube Inc.
