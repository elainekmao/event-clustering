<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003394 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PAUL THANOS </p><p>USTR FOR SAUMS </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, BEXP, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SYRIAN SOFT DRINKS SWAMP U.S. PRODUCTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) AMMAN 2093 B) AMMAN 2039 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) The local subsidiaries of Pepsi and Coca Cola say </p><p>that their soft drink sales are off by up to 40 percent from </p><p>2001 due to a new bilateral trade agreement between Jordan </p><p>and Syria that has led to an influx of Syrian soft drink </p><p>products  concurrent with the continuing boycott of American </p><p>products (REF A).  They also allege that the Syrian goods are </p><p>in clear violation of trademark regulations.  The companies </p><p>say their combined USD 200 million investment in Jordan is in </p><p>jeopardy.  They are requesting trade protection from the </p><p>Jordanian government and judicial system, but are drawing up </p><p>plans to lay off hundreds of employees should sales not pick </p><p>up.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In separate meetings with local Pepsi and Coke </p><p>officials, EmbOffs were informed about a major decline in </p><p>soft drink sales for both major brands, which together </p><p>control the Jordanian market.  While the decrease in sales </p><p>had begun late spring at a time when calls for a boycott of </p><p>American goods in the region peaked, the companies have </p><p>recently seen a sharp upsurge of lower-priced Syrian soft </p><p>drink products in Jordan, some of which are clear copies of </p><p>American beverages.  This follows the entry into force of a </p><p>bilateral trade agreement between Jordan and Syria, and </p><p>suggests that Syrian producers are exploiting the boycott to </p><p>get a foothold in the Jordanian market. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>THE REAL THING? </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) We met with Azem Yousef, General Manager of Coca </p><p>Cola Bottling LTD. of Jordan.  Yousef told us that business </p><p>was off by 30 percent for the year so far.  While he allowed </p><p>that the boycott was certainly having an impact, he pointed </p><p>to the sudden appearance of low-priced Syrian soft drinks on </p><p>the market.  Yousef said that the new Jordanian-Syrian trade </p><p>agreement allows Syrian soft drink manufacturers to export </p><p>their product to Jordan tariff-free.  He added that, although </p><p>Jordanian brands could enter Syria without tariffs under the </p><p>agreement, Pepsi and Coke were not allowed to register their </p><p>trademarks or sell their products in Syria.  Even at </p><p>wholesale prices, Yousef said, Coke cannot compete. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Yousef brought out some examples of the Syrian </p><p>products.  Master Cola is packaged in an indented plastic </p><p>bottle and is labeled in a manner, both in color and in </p><p>script, that is identical to Coke.  Similarly, flavored soft </p><p>drinks, such as "Master Orange", bear a striking resemblance </p><p>to Fanta, another Coca Cola product.  However, according to </p><p>Yousef, the similarity stops there; the Syrian flavors are </p><p>not even close approximations, and the plastic bottle is </p><p>milky, distorting the soda\'s true color. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Yousef also shared with us the results of a survey </p><p>commissioned by Coke to assess Jordanian attitudes toward the </p><p>boycott and his company\'s products.  The survey, which polled </p><p>1200 Jordanians across the country and was conducted by an </p><p>independent polling organization, showed that the primary </p><p>targets of the boycott are Jordanian companies with an </p><p>American brand name, over American companies and the USG.  In </p><p>addition, respondents were evenly split on the question of </p><p>whether or not the boycott should continue even if it hurt </p><p>the Jordanian work force.  On the positive side, the survey </p><p>suggested that less than 17 percent of those asked were </p><p>firmly committed to the boycott. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>CHEER UP </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) PepsiCo Jordan Managing Director Khaled al-Bakri </p><p>told us a similar story.  He said that Pepsi\'s current </p><p>numbers are "just like winter\'s", despite having "many more </p><p>throats" in Jordan this time of year, a reference to the </p><p>200,000 or so Saudis and Gulf residents that spend their </p><p>summers in cooler Amman.  He said that business was down 40 </p><p>percent from last year, and attributed the decline to the </p><p>Syrian products.  He echoed Yousef\'s view that Syrian </p><p>producers were using the trade agreement to take advantage of </p><p>the boycott and pry their way into the Jordanian market, </p><p>saying "the flood of Syrian soft drinks encourages the </p><p>sustainment of the boycott". </p><p>7.  (SBU) Al-Bakri showed us a study done by Pepsi in </p><p>collaboration with Coke on the economic impact of the </p><p>imported soft drinks on both American brands.  In addition to </p><p>a USD25 million loss in revenue to the two companies, the GOJ </p><p>would see a USD 13 million shortfall in sales tax revenue </p><p>since the Syrian product is being under-invoiced at the </p><p>border.  More importantly, he said, if sales don\'t pick up, </p><p>as many as 900 employees from both companies would have to be </p><p>laid off by the end of the year.  He stressed the point by </p><p>telling us that the company\'s HR Director was preparing </p><p>contingency plans for a layoff of up to 400 employees, out of </p><p>a 1200 person workforce, by the end of the summer if sales </p><p>did not pick up.  Al-Bakri added that, due to continued </p><p>losses by its Jordanian subsidiary, Pepsi had begun "to write </p><p>down" the operation in Jordan as a five year amortization </p><p>rather than 20 years. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Courtesy of Al-Bakri, we saw another example of </p><p>copycat Syrian beverages.  Cheer Up, produced by the Udarit </p><p>Trading Company of Damascus, is packaged identically to </p><p>PepsiCo\'s Seven Up, right down to the background shading of </p><p>the can and even the logo itself.  He said that there are no </p><p>intellectual property rights concerns in Syria, hence the </p><p>ability of Syrian companies to produce whatever they want </p><p>without regard to trademark considerations.  Al-Bakri said </p><p>that he had recently seen other products, such as candies, </p><p>pirated by Syrian companies in similar fashion. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>COMPETITORS JOIN FORCES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Yousef and al-Bakri met jointly with Minister of </p><p>Industry and Trade Bashir June 17.  They told us the Minister </p><p>was very supportive, and encouraged them to apply to the </p><p>Ministry for trade protection.  Al-Bakri said the criterion </p><p>the companies had to demonstrate was that an increase in </p><p>Syrian imports was followed by a significant decline in the </p><p>production and sales of the Jordanian-produced soft drinks. </p><p>Following the application, there would be a 200 day temporary </p><p>injunction on Syrian imports while the application was </p><p>reviewed.  Yousef added that the Minister suggested they file </p><p>trademark infringement cases in Jordanian court.  (Note: </p><p>Al-Bakri told us that PepsiCo Regional Director Sa\'ad </p><p>Abdul-Latif was coming to Jordan June 19-20 to meet with GOJ </p><p>officials in an effort to heighten government awareness of </p><p>the problem.  Ambassador and Embassy staff will meet with </p><p>Abdul-Latif to follow up). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Despite this combined USD 200 million invested in </p><p>Jordan, USD 60 million in salaries and benefits, USD 50 </p><p>million in capital expenditures, and USD 150 million in sales </p><p>tax, Pepsi and Coke have suffered combined net losses of USD </p><p>55 million since 1997.  Executives are growing increasingly </p><p>frustrated.  In addition, confiscatory sales taxes and </p><p>unfounded quality control issues with the Ministry of Health </p><p>(REF B), coming as they have during an already costly </p><p>boycott, have soured the investments for the American </p><p>companies. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The influx of Syrian product, with its attendant </p><p>IPR problems, exacerbation of the boycott, and impact on </p><p>sales, is another example of the difficulties of doing </p><p>business in Jordan despite the economic reforms of the past </p><p>several years.  Significant layoffs and the potential </p><p>abandonment of the Jordanian market by PepsiCo would be even </p><p>more troubling.  Embassy staff will continue working with </p><p>Pepsi, Coke, and GOJ officials to sort through the issues </p><p>raised by the Jordan-Syrian FTA and its impact on American </p><p>business.  END COMMENT </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
