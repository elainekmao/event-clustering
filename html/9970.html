(SBU) US/Mission Rome Humanitarian Attache visited two </p><p>UNHCR-managed Rohingya refugee camps on July 29-30 - </p><p>Kutupalong and Nayapara - located in Teknaf Thana (Cox\'s </p><p>Bazar district, at the southernmost tip of Bangladesh </p><p>directly bordering Burma) which house approximately 20,000 </p><p>Burmese Muslims from Arakan (Rakhine) State in western </p><p>Burma. He found increasing pressure tactics being employed </p><p>by camp authorities and local officials to accelerate </p><p>repatriation efforts, an attempt to marginalize the role of </p><p>UNHCR\'s two most prominent international NGO partners (MSF- </p><p>Holland and Irish Concern), and the UNHCR\'s in-country team </p><p>in a phase-down, overtaken by events mode. He also observed </p><p>a "make-shift camp/slum" located in the center of Teknaf </p><p>town, occupied by approximately 4,500 Rohingya people dubbed </p><p>"illegal intruders" who have been living there for the past </p><p>8-9 months under abominable conditions and who receive </p><p>virtually no assistance. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) US Mission/Rome Humanitarian Attache Tim Lavelle </p><p>visited two UNHCR-managed Rohingya refugee camps on July 29- </p><p>30 - Kutupalong and Nayapara - located in Teknaf Thana </p><p>(Cox\'s Bazar district, southern Bangladesh) which house </p><p>approximately 20,000 Burmese Muslims from Arakan (Rakhine) </p><p>State in western Burma. The Rohingyas in these camps (more </p><p>than twenty such camps were established in the early 1990\'s </p><p>which are now down to two) are officially recognized as </p><p>refugees by UNHCR, which is directly responsible for their </p><p>survival and safety. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In the period 1991-1992, approximately 250,000 </p><p>Rohingya Muslims left Burma, victims of large-scale </p><p>repression at that time. In addition to the camp populations </p><p>cited above, an estimated minimum of 100,000 Rohingya </p><p>presently live in the Cox\'s Bazar region and are considered </p><p>illegal immigrants by the Bangladeshi government. This </p><p>latter group has no rights, and no substantive help or </p><p>assistance from anyone. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Both at present and historically, there is a clear </p><p>policy of discrimination against the Rohingya in Burma. As </p><p>per the 2002 State Department\'s Country Report on Human </p><p>Rights in Burma: "Members of the Rohingya Muslim minority in </p><p>Rakhine State, on the country\'s western coast, continued to </p><p>experience severe legal, economic, and social </p><p>discrimination. The Government (has) denied citizenship to </p><p>most Rohingya on the grounds that their ancestors did not </p><p>reside in the country at the start of British colonial rule </p><p>in 1824, as required by the country\'s highly restrictive </p><p>citizenship law."  Human Rights Watch (in their July 2002 </p><p>Report entitled "Crackdown on Burmese Muslims") commented: </p><p>"In Arakan state, a predominately Muslim area, human rights </p><p>violations, including forced labor, restrictions on freedom </p><p>of movement, and the destruction of mosques, have been </p><p>commonplace." Note: US Mission officer met in Teknaf with an </p><p> </p><p>MSF-Holland (MSF-H) representative based in Arakan State who </p><p>confirmed that these egregious practices were continuing - </p><p>in addition to imposition of large "fees" for marriage and </p><p>birth registration ("there are lots of villages where no one </p><p>has married for several years"), arbitrary taxation, opaque </p><p>licensing and monopoly schemes linked to land and water </p><p>access, and frequent curfews. End note. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Reportedly in the first visit by the Burma Head of </p><p>State to Bangladesh (Dhaka) in 20 years in December 2002, </p><p>the subject of repatriation of Rohingyas was discussed. In </p><p>April 2003 in Geneva, the Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary </p><p>(Samser Mobin Chowdhury) reiterated Bangladesh\'s support to </p><p>all efforts for Burmese refugees remaining in Bangladesh to </p><p>return promptly to their homeland. Over the last several </p><p>months, the Burmese Government has sent signals that all </p><p>"constraints" on refugee return are now "off" and that </p><p>authorities will now accept all refugee claims at "face </p><p>value." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Whither UNHCR Bangladesh? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) UNHCR did a survey in Bangladesh at the end of 2002 </p><p>which concluded that the majority of refugees in the Teknaf </p><p>camps did not want to return for a variety of reasons. Some </p><p>5,000 expressed interest in returning but cited </p><p>"complications." UNHCR Bangladesh then proceeded to produce </p><p>(December 23) a concept paper (which still, in US Mission\'s </p><p>understanding, remains in draft) entitled "Self-Sufficiency </p><p>of Refugees From Northern Rakhine State of Myanmar in </p><p>Bangladesh." This paper apparently commented on how refugees </p><p>could be helped toward self-reliance using as a guiding </p><p>principle the concept of Temporary Settlement (TS) in local </p><p>Bangladeshi communities for refugees who would not opt for </p><p>immediate repatriation. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Despite "scuttling" early on the TS idea as a non- </p><p>starter, given the improved bilateral climate between the </p><p>two concerned governments, UNHCR verbally promulgated a </p><p>rolling strategy several months later which involved a phase- </p><p>out of UNHCR material assistance by the end of 2003; and </p><p>informed its two principal NGO partners (MSF-H and Irish </p><p>Concern) of UNHCR\'s unilateral decision to have both NGOs </p><p>hand over their respective health programs (health care for </p><p>children under ten, including supplementary and therapeutic </p><p>feeding) by July 1 to the Government\'s Ministry of Health </p><p>(MOH). Note: At the time of the visit, the handover date had </p><p>slipped to August 1, but it was evident that the MOH is not </p><p>in a position to assume this substantive NGO workload any </p><p>time soon. End note. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Additional note. In a subsequent meeting in Dhaka </p><p>(July 31) with the UNHCR Country Representative, Ms. Machiko </p><p>Kondo, US Mission was informed that UNHCR was motivated to </p><p>hand over its Rohingya camp health activities to the MOH in </p><p>part based upon a 2002 recommendation of  UNHCR\'s External </p><p>Auditor who apparently concluded that, with a reduced case </p><p>load in the camps (compared with the 1990s) - the district </p><p>MOH would be up to the task. Ms. Kondo also saw greater MOH </p><p>involvement as an integral part of UNHCR\'s self-sufficiency </p><p>approach. End additional note. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Ms. Kondo also informed US Mission that the latest </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR A/S PRM DEWEY, IO A/S HOLMES, EUR/NE, EUR/WE, </p><p>SA/INS, IO/EDA SKOTOK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS, RTILSWORTH AND LPANASUK </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, A </p><p> </p><p>iteration of the "self-sufficiency" strategy was presently </p><p>under active discussion in UNHCR Headquarters, Geneva. The </p><p>other partners (World Food Program, MSF-H, Irish Concern and </p><p>the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS)- the latter </p><p>supervises food distributions in the camps) - all voiced </p><p>concern over the complete lack of consultation and </p><p>communications in the elaboration of this plan. (Meetings on </p><p>these issues and time frames between UNHCR and its partners </p><p>have been going on since late last year with little </p><p>concluded or agreed upon.)  Both international NGOs saw the </p><p>folding of all health care efforts into the local MOH as a </p><p>quick way of eliminating their "honest broker" efforts on </p><p>behalf of "voluntary repatriation." It was also not clear to </p><p>the US Mission whether this latest draft strategy had even </p><p>been shared with the Bangladesh Government. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>A visit to the two official camps - "Quibbling over the </p><p>definition of coercion" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Walkthroughs (with GOB, UN and NGO personnel) on </p><p>July 29-30 of the officially recognized Kutupalong and </p><p>Nayapara camps (populations of 8,268 and 12,495 Rohingya on </p><p>June 30 respectively) revealed the following: </p><p> </p><p>-There remains high chronic malnutrition in both camps, </p><p>despite an involved and sustained international NGO presence </p><p>over a number of years. Both camps have  supplementary </p><p>(total coverage 1,300 mothers and small children) and </p><p>therapeutic feeding centers (covering 100 acutely </p><p>malnourished children) and WFP has now introduced a primary </p><p>school biscuit snack program for up to 6,000 camp children; </p><p> </p><p>-There is a visible local police presence in both camps, </p><p>which is reinforced by paramilitary cadres. We also came </p><p>across a plain-clothed "enforcer" (adept at crowd control), </p><p>who appeared to be well known and feared by the Nayapara </p><p>camp residents; </p><p> </p><p>-Both of the two Camp-in-Charge GOB officers conveyed that, </p><p>in their view, almost all of the refugees wanted to go back </p><p>(now that the Government of Burma had agreed to their </p><p>return) and that they saw their job as making this happen </p><p>soonest. They stated that the overall goal is to have all </p><p>camp residents repatriated by the end of 2004; </p><p> </p><p>-On the day of the visit, tension was particularly high at </p><p>the Kutupalong camp where several groups of women held up </p><p>banners protesting "bully-boy" tactics and heightened </p><p>(verbal at this point) threats of intimidation. US Mission </p><p>was handed a petition (one of dozens that are reportedly </p><p>generated weekly and given to UN and NGO personnel) which </p><p>contained the following: "The principles of voluntariness in </p><p>repatriation, respecting fundamental principles of the </p><p>refugee law had been/have been/are being excessively </p><p>violated by GOB Camp officials;" </p><p> </p><p>-MSF-H and Irish Concern staff reported that they are now </p><p>starting to receive threatening letters accusing them of </p><p>siding with the "dissidents" who want to block the now </p><p>accelerating repatriation process;S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR A/S PRM DEWEY, IO A/S HOLMES, EUR/NE, EUR/WE, </p><p>SA/INS, IO/EDA SKOTOK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS, RTILSWORTH AND LPANASUK </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, AA/ANE, </p><p>D/DCHA/ </p><p> </p><p>-It was clear from viewing MOH facilities and staff in place </p><p>at both camps that they are presently operating on a </p><p>"shoestring" with a modicum of personnel and little </p><p>equipment. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Note: For our visit, the local UNHCR staff in the </p><p>camps preferred to play the role of "silent backbenchers." </p><p>End note. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>The "makeshift camp/slum" of Rohingya "illegal intruders" in </p><p>Teknaf town </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) US Mission observed a 3-4 acre "make-shift camp/ </p><p>slum" located in the center of Teknaf town, opposite the </p><p>Thana Executive office. It contains an estimated 4,500 </p><p>Rohingyas. There is speculation that many of these are </p><p>refugees who were repatriated by UNHCR over the last years </p><p>and decided to return again (by illegally crossing back into </p><p>Bangladesh). This slum has received little serious attention </p><p>from the UN, the GOB or the NGOs since its emplacement 8-9 </p><p>months ago. As per MSF-H, the Thana Executive Officer in </p><p>Teknaf describes these people as "illegal intruders." As per </p><p>the NGOs, this slum came into being as a direct result of a </p><p>GOB military-style operation late last year in the area </p><p>focused on uprooting illegal immigrants ("Operation Clean </p><p>Heart").  This "sweep" was specifically targeted at the </p><p>100,000 "illegal" Rohingyas (the minimum guess) presently </p><p>living in the Cox\'s Bazar area (outside the official camps). </p><p>The condition of these Rihingya slum dwellers in Teknaf town </p><p>is abominable. When queried, the position of the local UNHCR </p><p>office towards those people is that they are not refugees </p><p>and there is therefore no foreseen or anticipated action, as </p><p>this could trigger further probing as to who these people </p><p>are and so forth. UNHCR confirmed that they had visited the </p><p>"makeshift camp/slum" on several occasions but that no </p><p>assistance had been nor would be provided. From July, the </p><p>GOB deployed a small contingent of local police at the site. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) MSF-H informed that it had obtained tentative </p><p>permission of the GOB\'s Thana leader to access the camp and </p><p>had been carrying out limited health education for the </p><p>"makeshift camp population," including encouraging them to </p><p>access the government hospital for general treatment or </p><p>other illnesses. The nutritional situation is grim with </p><p>clear and visible signs of acute malnutrition (marasmus), in </p><p>particular among the under-fives (mostly girls). Water for </p><p>the camp is supplied by two government-provided tube wells. </p><p>US Mission was also informed that 10 latrines had been dug </p><p>but that overuse and the present monsoon had rendered them </p><p>unusable. Note: on August 5, US Mission learned from WFP </p><p>Dhaka that the local MOH had agreed to "intervene" in the </p><p>Teknaf slum. End note. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Conclusions and Recommendations </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) It is imperative that all pressure, overt and </p><p>covert, direct and indirect, on the 20,000 official Rohingya </p><p>refugees to repatriate against their will on the part of </p><p>camp and local authorities - cease with immediate effect. </p><p>UNHCR needs to affirm that continued international and localS PENN, </p><p>MCHAMBLISS, RTILSWORTH AND LPANASUK </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, AA/ANE, </p><p>D/DCHA/OFDA BMCCONNELL, D/DCHA/FFP LANDIS </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USAID/PLERNER </p><p>USUN FOR MLUTZ </p><p>GENEVA FOR AMBASSADOR MOLEY, RMA/LYNCH AND USAID/ </p><p> </p><p>NGO presence in these camps as "honest brokers" in the </p><p>voluntary repatriation process is critical. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) UNHCR and its UN sister agencies need to recognize </p><p>that, as long as the Government of Burma continues its </p><p>repression towards the people of Arakan in general and the </p><p>Rohingya Muslims in particular, UN engagement in Cox\' Bazar </p><p>district will continue and that adequate resources must be </p><p>allotted. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Any refugee "self-sufficiency plan" developed by </p><p>UNHCR for the remaining residual caseload of 20,000 </p><p>Rohingyas - needs to be fully vetted with all key </p><p>counterparts (WFP, MSF-H, Irish Concern, Bangladesh Red </p><p>Crescent, etc) and realistic timeframes mutually agreed upon </p><p>in an open and transparent manner. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) The UN needs to urgently request the Government of </p><p>Bangladesh to allow UN Agencies and NGOs to provide </p><p>humanitarian assistance to the 4,500 Rohingya living in the </p><p>"makeshift camp/slum" in Teknaf town. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) UNHCR is asked to consider an assessment to </p><p>determine the approximate number of Rohingya "illegals" </p><p>living in the Cox\'s Bazar district, (minimum estimate </p><p>100,000) and suggest a strategy for dealing with them </p><p>because this is not going to go away. </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) The UN needs also to move forward with the </p><p>establishment of a code of conduct and standards of behavior </p><p>for its staffs and partners related to protection of </p><p>vulnerable populations for sexual exploitation and abuse as </p><p>mandated by the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee at its </p><p>fifty-third session in Geneva in July, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) UNHCR and its partners have been intimately </p><p>involved with the Rohingyas in Cox\'s Bazar since 1991-1992, </p><p>the initial exodus of 250,000 refugees who left Burma due to </p><p>acute repression. While the official numbers indicate that, </p><p>over the last decade, 230,000 have returned home, many have </p><p>chosen to re-return to Bangladesh as "illegals" rather than </p><p>deal with the nightmare that is Burma. The remaining </p><p>official "residual" caseload of 20,000 Rohingyas will (in </p><p>our view) return only under increased intimidation, which is </p><p>already evident at the camps. Despite the desire of the GOB </p><p>to come to closure on this long-festering matter, UNHCR has </p><p>to remain the unwavering advocate of those Rohingyas who do </p><p>not choose repatriation. This is not the moment for naivete </p><p>or rosy optimism. As expressed in a refugee petition handed </p><p>to us in the Kutupalong camp on July 29: "Seeing no </p><p>international protection and alternative, we, the </p><p>unfortunate victims of injustice make up our mind to sign up </p><p>the affidavit (the future death trap of Rohingya refugee) </p><p>and go back to Burma with well founded fear of genocide and </p><p>persecution only to escape the physical torture, arbitrary </p><p>arrests, jail custody, expulsion from the camps and </p><p>starvation. We the refugees go back to Burma through one way </p><p>and leave the homes and enter into Bangladesh through </p><p>another way." </p><p>Hall </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03583 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
