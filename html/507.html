<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TOKYO 04774 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR HENNESEY/OASIA/IDB </p><p> </p><p>MANILA FOR USADB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  EFIN, JA </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAN, THE ADB, AND THE IBRD </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 69132  (B) TOKYO 3330 </p><p>      (C) STATE 97814 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FINATT CALLED ON HIROSHI TOYODA (DIRECTOR, DEVELOPMENT </p><p>INSTITUTIONS DIVISION, MINISTRY OF FINANCE) TO ASCERTAIN </p><p>WHETHER GOJ HAD FINALIZED ITS VIEW ON IRAN JOINING THE ASIAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT BANK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  TOYODA SAID THE MATTER IS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED </p><p>INTERNALLY WITHIN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, BUT AS FAR AS THE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTRY OF JAPAN IS CONCERNED, THEY WILL SUPPORT IRAN </p><p>JOINING THE ADB.  TOYODA NOTED THAT EVEN BEFORE FINATT HAD </p><p>MADE EARLIER DEMARCHE (REF B), MOF HAD INFORMALLY COMMUNICATED </p><p>ITS SUPPORT OF IRAN TO THE ADB.  A FORMAL POSITION WON\'T BE </p><p>ANNOUNCED UNTIL MOFA HAS COMPLETED ITS INTERNAL DELIBERATIONS, </p><p>BUT ON MATTERS OF THIS TYPE MOF TYPICALLY PREVAILS OVER MOFA </p><p>UNLESS THERE ARE EXCEPTIONAL POLITICAL REASONS WEIGHING IN </p><p>MOFA\'S FAVOR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MOF\'S DECISION IS BASED ON IRAN BEING A MEMBER OF OTHER </p><p>IFIS (IMF, IBRD) AND ITS INCLUSION AS A REGIONAL COUNTRY UNDER </p><p>ESCAP.  TOYODA SAID MOF SYMPATHIZES WITH USG ON NOT WANTING A </p><p>SPONSOR OF STATE TERRORISM TO HAVE ACCESS TO IFI RESOURCES, </p><p>WHICH MAY THEN ALLOW DIVERSION OF FUNDS TO TERRORIST </p><p>PURPOSES.  BUT GIVEN THE ESCAP DEFINITION OF REGIONAL </p><p>COUNTRIES, AND IRAN\'S OTHER IFI MEMBERSHIPS, MOF FEELS IT </p><p>APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT MEMBERSHIP IN THE ADB. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ON THE OTHER HAND, MOF WILL NOT LOBBY OTHER COUNTRIES TO </p><p>SUPPORT MEMBERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>6.  TOYODA SAID NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE </p><p>IRANIANS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WITH RESPECT TO IBRD LENDING, AND POSSIBLE FUTURE LENDING </p><p>BY THE ADB IF IRAN BECOMES A MEMBER OF THAT INSTITUTION, </p><p>TOYODA SAID MOF WOULD BE FLEXIBLE, AND POSSIBLY OPPOSE LOANS </p><p>"A LA THE PRC" FOLLOWING THE TIANANMEN SQUARE INCIDENT AND THE </p><p>G-7 AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, IF THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF A </p><p>PROJECT IS SO OVERWHELMINGLY CONVINCING, MOF WOULD HAVE </p><p>DIFFICULTY OPPOSING SUCH A LOAN FOR IRAN IN IBRD OR ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ON RELATED MATTERS, TOYODA CONTINUES TO ASK "WHO" ASKED US </p><p>ABOUT NORTH KOREA\'S OBSERVER STATUS AT THE ADB.  FINATT SAID </p><p>HE WOULD INQUIRE.  WITH REGARD TO THE MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT </p><p>FUND OF THE EAI, TOYODA NOTED THAT JAPAN\'S DIET CLEARED THE </p><p>WAY LAST FRIDAY (MARCH 27) FOR JAPAN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MIF </p><p>UP TO $500 MILLION OVER 5 YEARS.  MOF ASKS THE STATUS OF USG </p><p>APPROPRIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ARMACOST </p><p></p></div>
