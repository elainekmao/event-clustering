<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 000425 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA, WHA/CEN, WHA/CCA, DRL/IL, AND DS/OP/WHA </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ELAB, ETRD, PHUM, PINR, SOCI, ASEC, CU, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATIONS IN TEGUCIGALPA: FOCUS IS ON GOH </p><p>POLICIES, BUT SUB-THEMES ARE ANTI-U.S. AND PRO-CUBA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 TEGUCIGALPA 2987 </p><p>     B. 02 TEGUCIGALPA 2928 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Chief Francisco Palmieri; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Political demonstrations continue off and on in </p><p>Tegucigalpa, led by various small organizations, the loose </p><p>political alliance known as the Popular Block, secondary </p><p>teachers (COPEMH), and others.  Sometimes the protests are </p><p>staged outside the Embassy, but more commonly they are held </p><p>downtown in front of Congress.  Frequently, many of the </p><p>"demonstrators" are bused in from outside Tegucigalpa.  These </p><p>"protesters for hire" are paid for their services prior to </p><p>leaving Tegucigalpa.  At some of the smaller demonstrations, </p><p>few of the demonstrators, other than the leaders, appear to </p><p>be from Tegucigalpa.  While persistent, they pose little </p><p>threat to social order and do not appear to have captured the </p><p>broader general public\'s support or interest. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The most recent demonstration outside the Embassy </p><p>occurred January 30 with about 100-130 demonstrators </p><p>organized by the Civic Council of Popular Organizations and </p><p>Indigenous of Honduras (COPINH), and led by Salvadore Zuniga. </p><p> Protesters opposed a possible war in Iraq, privatization, </p><p>and "neocolonialism."  The demonstrators also criticized Plan </p><p>Colombia, CAFTA, U.S. policy in Cuba and Venezuela, U.S. </p><p>military cooperation with Honduras, and the electricity </p><p>contract for U.S. company AES.  The group then linked up with </p><p>a larger group downtown organized by the Popular Block.  At </p><p>the end of this larger demonstration protesters were told </p><p>that there would be worldwide demonstrations at U.S. </p><p>embassies, including in Tegucigalpa, on Saturday, February </p><p>15.  The press has also repeated information about a possible </p><p>anti-U.S. demonstration February 15. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Demonstrations are often pro-Cuban in flavor, such as </p><p>the December 5, 2002 demonstration by 200 people outside the </p><p>Embassy organized by the Honduras-Cuba Friendship Association </p><p>(AHC), which protested alleged U.S. injustices against Cuba. </p><p>The same day a larger demonstration downtown protested </p><p>against the "privatization" of health services.  Carlos </p><p>Reyes, leader of the Popular Block, criticized alleged U.S. </p><p>"imperialism" at the larger demonstration. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Popular Block and the secondary teachers are the </p><p>most frequent demonstrators.  They protest privatization, </p><p>civil service salary levels, and the public health system. </p><p>These protests, however, are usually focused on GOH polices </p><p>and not the USG, although they often have a anti-USG sub-text </p><p>to them.  Popular Block leader Carlos Reyes has also written </p><p>an anti-CAFTA and anti-FTAA booklet. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  None of the recent demonstrations, unlike </p><p>one in October 2002 (ref A), have been violent, and they are </p><p>still more a worry than a serious problem for the Maduro </p><p>Administration.  Protests, however, are likely to heat up </p><p>over a draft Civil Service Framework Bill, which the GOH has </p><p>yet to introduce to Congress, that will likely de-link civil </p><p>service salaries from being indexed to raises in the minimum </p><p>wage.  Post also notes that there may be Cuban support for </p><p>some of the anti-U.S. demonstrations, as evidenced by the </p><p>December 5 demonstration organized by the Honduras-Cuba </p><p>Friendship Association and the continual criticism of U.S. </p><p>policy on Cuba in kitchen-sink style protests.  End Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
