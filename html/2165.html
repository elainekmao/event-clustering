<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002856 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ETRD, PHUM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: AGOA ELIGIBILTY REVIEW FOR NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 191161 </p><p>     B. 00 ABUJA 9427 </p><p>     C. 00 STATE 110733 </p><p>     D. 00 STATE 127971 </p><p>     E. 00 STATE 126813 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Post has reviewed all documents relating to AGOA </p><p>eligibility for Nigeria including reftels C, D and E, the </p><p>2000 Human Rights Report, this year,s report on trafficking </p><p>in women and children, and the first draft of the 2001 Human </p><p>Rights Report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The following is an update of the information provided </p><p>previously in response to ref A. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.A: The GON continues to make slow progress in </p><p>developing an open economy, minimizing government </p><p>interference and promoting free market principles. </p><p>Privatization of the national telecommunications monopoly </p><p>(NITEL) is scheduled to take place before year-end 2001. </p><p>Privatization of the National Insurance Company (NICON), </p><p>ship-builder Nigerdock, the New Nigerian Newspapers and other </p><p>public enterprises continue to move forward faster than many </p><p>international experts forecasted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.B: Ethnic and religious tension increased sharply in </p><p>the last half of 2001, with communal clashes in parts of the </p><p>country claiming a few thousand lives.  Despite these </p><p>difficulties, the GON has on several occasions restated its </p><p>commitment to the rule of law, political pluralism and human </p><p>rights.  Work remains to be done in implementing these </p><p>rights, however.  The GON has programs underway to reform the </p><p>military, police force and judicial system.  The Obasanjo </p><p>Administration does not have a policy of supporting human </p><p>rights abuses.  Freedom of speech and of the press is largely </p><p>respected.  Limited resources to train security forces in </p><p>proper techniques and respect for human rights have limited </p><p>GON success in preventing individual members of security </p><p>agencies, including police and military personnel, from </p><p>abusing the rights of fellow citizens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.C: The GON continues to move toward policies </p><p>eliminating barriers to U.S. trade and investment. </p><p>Currently, the GON is seeking to harmonize, and add </p><p>transparency to, existing investment codes and regulations. </p><p>The GON is moving in the direction of lower tariffs, </p><p>particularly for manufacturing inputs, and has established </p><p>export-processing zones where exporters can receive special </p><p>duty treatment.  The GON has made progress on restructuring </p><p>the intellectual property rights regime; draft legislation to </p><p>create a quasi-independent IPR office is pending approval by </p><p>the Executive Council.  Additionally, our two governments are </p><p>restructuring the bilateral economic dialogue in order to </p><p>achieve concrete progress in trade and investment between the </p><p>two nations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.D: Although the GON expresses commitment to poverty </p><p>alleviation, progress has been slow.  Gross Domestic Product </p><p>grew only 3.2 percent in 2000, barely exceeding population </p><p>growth.  The vast majority of wealth in the country continues </p><p>to be held by a multi-ethnic elite that, however, represents </p><p>a small percentage of the population.  The Niger Delta </p><p>Development Commission was created to address health care and </p><p>educational deficiencies in one of Nigeria\'s least developed </p><p>regions.  However, the NDDC has not yet received the total </p><p>funding necessary to fulfill its mandate.  The GON is also </p><p>committed to developing a Poverty Reduction Strategy in </p><p>cooperation with the IMF.  This medium-term strategy may </p><p>accelerate progress in poverty reduction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.E: Efforts against corruption have not abated, but </p><p>neither have these efforts registered successes with major </p><p>positive effect on the macro-economy.  A Budget Monitoring </p><p>and Price Unit has been established to provide due process </p><p>for all government procurements.  Additionally, the GON has </p><p>cooperated in auditing all end-2000 and 2001 capital </p><p>projects.  As part of the current IMF policy framework, the </p><p>GON has agreed to publish the results of the audits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.F.2: The GON does not engage in activities that </p><p>undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. </p><p> President Obasanjo has been at the forefront of African </p><p>Heads of State by unconditionally and publicly supporting </p><p>U.S. effort to find and bring to justice the perpetrators of </p><p>the September 11 attacks and to combat terrorism globally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 5: Nigeria has agreed to, but not yet ratified, ILO </p><p>Conventions 182, Worst Form of Child Labor, and 138, Minimum </p><p>Age for Employment.  Legislation prohibits children under 15 </p><p>years to work in most sectors and outlaws forced or </p><p>compulsory labor.  However, enforcement is weak.  Post will </p><p>address issues related to child labor in more detail via </p><p>septel. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
