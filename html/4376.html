<p>S E C R E T ROME 005599 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IT, EUN, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: DELIVERY OF PRESIDENT\'S MESSAGE TO PM BERLUSCONI </p><p> </p><p>REF: WHITE HOUSE 150626ZNOV02 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION EMIL SKODON, REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY DCM, MET WITH PM BERLUSCONI </p><p>AT CIAMPINO AIRPORT LATE EVENING OF 15 NOVEMBER TO DELIVER </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MESSAGE ON THE PRAGUE NATO SUMMIT AND TO </p><p>DISCUSS OTHER ISSUES (SEPTEL).  BERLUSCONI WAS MAKING A SHORT </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05599  182359Z </p><p>TRANSIT STOP AT CIAMPINO ON THE WAY TO HIS HOME IN SARDINIA </p><p>FROM AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO SKOPJE.  BERLUSCONI\'S DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISOR CASTELLANETA AND CHIEF OF STAFF VALENTINI WERE ALSO </p><p>PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) BERLUSCONI DESCRIBED THE PRESIDENT\'S DECISION TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE NATO CANDIDACY OF SEVEN ASPIRANT COUNTRIES AS </p><p>"GOOD NEWS," AND SAID HE WAS IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT. </p><p>REFERRING TO THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN INITIATIVE SUMMIT FROM </p><p>WHICH HE HAD JUST COME, BERLUSCONI OBSERVED THAT ALL OF THE </p><p>NON-NATO COUNTRIES AT THE SUMMIT WANTED TO BE IN NATO </p><p>SOMEDAY.  IT WAS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD BE A LONG ROAD </p><p>FOR MANY, SUCH AS MACEDONIA, GIVEN THEIR LOW LEVEL OF </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  BERLUSCONI ALSO PICKED UP ON (AND </p><p>APPRECIATED) THAT PORTION OF THE PRESIDENT\'S LETTER WHICH </p><p>COMMENDED HIM FOR REJECTING PROPOSED CUTS IN GOI DEFENSE </p><p>SPENDING, COMMENTING THAT HE WANTED TO INCREASE DEFENSE </p><p>SPENDING LEVELS IF HE COULD, NOT JUST MAINTAIN THEM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) AMBASSADOR BRIEFED DEFMIN MARTINO ON CONTENTS OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S LETTER THE FOLLOWING DAY, SATURDAY THE 16TH, IN A </p><p>CONVERSATION AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE.  DCM WAS ALSO </p><p>PRESENT.  MARTINO WELCOMED THE NEWS OF THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>DECISION ON THE SEVEN ASPIRANT COUNTRIES.  REGARDING DEFENSE </p><p>SPENDING LEVELS, MARTINO SAID HE HAD FOUGHT HARD AGAINST </p><p>PROPOSED DEFENSE CUTS IN THIS YEAR\'S GOI BUDGET SUBMISSION, </p><p>AND HE WOULD CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR INCREASED SPENDING OVER THE </p><p>NEXT FIVE YEARS TO MEET NATO CAPABILITY COMMITMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) THE DEFMIN NOTED THAT HE HAD AGREED TO FOUR OF THE </p><p>FIVE SPECIFIC CAPABILITY PRIORITIES FOR ITALY PROPOSED BY </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05599  182359Z </p><p>LORD ROBERTSON, BUT COULD NOT SIGN UP TO THE GOI SPENDING </p><p>MORE ON STRATEGIC AIRLIFT SINCE CURRENT GOI ASSETS (PRIMARILY </p><p>C-130J\'S) WERE SUFFICIENT.  IN FACT, MARTINO SAID, STRATEGIC </p><p>LIFT WAS ABOUT THE ONLY AREA WHERE THE MOD DID NOT NEED TO </p><p>SPEND MORE.  WHEN MORE LIFT ASSETS WERE NEEDED, THE GOI COULD </p><p>RENT ANTONOV\'S AS IT HAD IN THE PAST.  MARTINO OBSERVED THAT </p><p>IF YOU ONLY USE A CAR A FEW TIMES A YEAR, IT MAKES SENSE TO </p><p>RENT INSTEAD OF TO BUY; AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED, THE SAME </p><p>PRINCIPLE APPLIED TO ADDITIONAL AIRLIFT ASSETS.  NOTING THAT </p><p>GERMAN CHANCELLOR SCHROEDER WAS SEEKING TO SPEAK WITH PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI ABOUT NATO CAPABILITIES, MARTINO SHARED HIS </p><p>SUSPICION THAT SCHROEDER INTENDED TO PUSH BERLUSCONI TO </p><p>REVERSE THE GOI DECISION NOT TO BUY A-400\'S, IN ORDER TO TAKE </p><p>THE PRESSURE OFF GERMANY TO PURCHASE MORE.  MARTINO WONDERED </p><p>ALOUD IF SAVING THE A-400 PROGRAM MIGHT BE THE REAL MOTIVE </p><p>BEHIND LORD ROBERTSON\'S PITCH TO THE GOI TO ACQUIRE MORE </p><p>AIRLIFT CAPABILITY. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05599 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
