Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Despite recent assurances from the </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture officials that new quarantine </p><p>regulations would not go into affect until July 2004, Turkey </p><p>announced and implemented new phytosanitary regulations on </p><p>July 6, 2003. Most foreign embassies, trade associations and </p><p>trading companies were unaware of the announcement. A </p><p>translated version has been sent to USDA electronically. </p><p>Ankara had reminded Turkish officials that any new </p><p>regulations should be notified through the WTO to no avail. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Quarantine Regulations: A Complicated History </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  As part of its EU harmonization process, Turkey </p><p>issued new phytosanitary regulations in July 2002 with an </p><p>implementation date of January 2003.  Unfortunately, the </p><p>2002 regulations included some fairly onerous requirements </p><p>and, as a result, trade in corn and wheat practically </p><p>stopped in January 2003.  Pressure from the various groups </p><p>including the Turkish Feed Association, international </p><p>trading companies and foreign embassies resulted in a </p><p>suspension of the 2002 regulations.  Between February and </p><p>June 2003, the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture\'s Protection </p><p>and Control Secretariat solicited input from various groups </p><p>including USDA in order to rewrite the regulations.  As the </p><p>process dragged on, we were informed from various sources </p><p>that new regulations would be announced but that they would </p><p>not be implemented until 2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Turkish Regulations - Coming Sooner that Anticipated </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  On July 7, FAS/Ankara was notified that the </p><p>Turkish Protection and Control Department in the Ministry of </p><p>Agriculture had published and implemented new quarantine </p><p>regulations and that implementation would be immediate. We </p><p>had met with Abdulmecit Yesil, the head of the quarantine </p><p>section of Protection and Control, at the beginning of June </p><p>to discuss this issue. We were informed that the regulations </p><p>would be published shortly and distributed to all Embassies </p><p>in Ankara.  At the same time, Yesil again stated that the </p><p>new regulations would not go into effect until July 2004. As </p><p>late as last Friday, the Cargill/Ankara representative had </p><p>spoken with Turkish officials who assured him that the new </p><p>regulations would be delayed by one year.  According to a </p><p>trade contact, there was some sort of dispute between </p><p>Protection and Control and the Prime Minister\'s legal office </p><p>who demanded immediate implementation.  As a result, the new </p><p>regulations went into effect in 2003 instead of 2004 as </p><p>originally planned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Some Changes </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  We again met with Yesil on July 7.  He announced </p><p>that Protection and Control had no choice in the </p><p>announcement and that implementation had to be immediate, </p><p>for the most part.  He noted that some provisions would be </p><p>phased in over the course of three months. We have not been </p><p>able to determine whether this 3-month grace period is in </p><p>place.  These changes would be related to EU harmonization </p><p>and European Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) </p><p>regulations, but he was not specific. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Yesil stated that an English translation of the </p><p>document was in its final stages and would be distributed to </p><p>embassies in Ankara.  This translation has subsequently been </p><p>received and sent to Washington electronically.  According </p><p>to Yesil, testing for fusarium, a highly controversial part </p><p>of the July 2003 regulations has been dropped as has the </p><p>inconsistencies related to kiln-dried wood products. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Private Sector - New Regs May Not be a Problem </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  We contacted several companies and associations </p><p>as well as western embassies regarding the announcement. </p><p>Most were unaware of the new regulations.  Cargill/Istanbul </p><p>did know about the announcement and their impression was </p><p>that it would not affect imports of corn or wheat from any </p><p>country.  Comment.  In addition, some provisions may be </p><p>delayed for 90 days.  End comment.  However, until we are </p><p>able to do a closer examination of the regulations, we </p><p>cannot confirm.  Note: Oilseeds and cotton, two of the </p><p>largest commodities the U.S. exports to Turkey, are not </p><p>covered by the regulations.  End note.  Cargill officials </p><p>did say that planting seeds could be affected by the </p><p>regulation.  Calls to several embassies showed that none </p><p>were aware of the announcement.  We have contacted traders </p><p>who are currently unloading corn shipments.  There have been </p><p>no delays or problems with the current certificates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>WTO Notifications - A Nice Try </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Turkey\'s record on adhering to WTO rules has been </p><p>inconsistent at the very least.  In fact many, although not </p><p>all, frustrations with Turkish ag trade policy could be </p><p>avoided if Turkish officials were more transparent.  In </p><p>June, knowing that the new regulations would soon be </p><p>published, we reminded the Ministry of Agriculture and the </p><p>Under Secretariat for Foreign Trade that any change in their </p><p>regulations should be notified through the WTO. We were </p><p>assured, as we have been many times in the past that Turkey </p><p>would comply with their WTO responsibilities.  However, it </p><p>came as no surprise that notifications had not been made. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Comment:  Good Response but No Cigar </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  We have received an English translation of the </p><p>regulations and have sent it to USDA electronically.  We </p><p>have also sent a letter to the Director of Protection and </p><p>Control requesting a 90-day delay in implementation.  In </p><p>general, we have found most officials at the Ministry of </p><p>Agriculture to be helpful over the past several months. </p><p>Protection and Control officials were not only willing but </p><p>requested U.S. input for the regulations that we have taken </p><p>as encouraging sign.  However, in the end their abrupt </p><p>announcement and the absence of any official notification </p><p>only serves to question the ability and willingness of the </p><p>Turkish government to comply with international trade rules. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
