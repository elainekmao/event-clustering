<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 004914 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>NSC FOR BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDA FOR FAS FOR EC AND CCC/FSA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: MARKETS RALLY ON IMF/INFLATION NEWS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Turkish markets rallied Monday and Tuesday on the </p><p>back of good inflation news and the IMF Board\'s August 1 </p><p>decisions to approve the 5th Review and extend 2004-2005 </p><p>Turkish repurchases.  The lira strengthened to 1.406 </p><p>million/dollar, yields on the benchmark August 8, 2004 t-bill </p><p>dropped to 43.64 percent, and the stock market rose eight </p><p>percent to 11,499.89.  Amid much good news, the markets </p><p>shrugged off Moody\'s August 5 announcement that it was not </p><p>considering an upgrade of its currently negative outlook on </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The State Statistical Institute announced over the </p><p>weekend that that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell 0.4 </p><p>percent in July, while the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) </p><p>dropped 0.5 percent.  Analysts had expected CPI to increase </p><p>slightly and WPI to hold steady.  Declining food and clothing </p><p>prices, which usually soften in the summer due to seasonal </p><p>factors, were the driving force behind the drop in the </p><p>indeces, along with the continuing strength of the lira.  The </p><p>drop in prices has prompted several analysts to predict </p><p>another Central Bank rate cut, adding to the positive </p><p>momentum in the markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Markets welcomed the Fund\'s decision to extend </p><p>Turkey\'s 2004-2005 repurchases, which should reduce the </p><p>country\'s debt service load by nearly $7 billion over the </p><p>next two years.  Although most analysts had expected some </p><p>kind of "roll over," few expected the Fund\'s decision to be </p><p>made this soon and to include 2005 as well as 2004 payments. </p><p>Today, State Minister Babacan told the press that the Fund\'s </p><p>decision would ease Turkey\'s debt burden over the next two </p><p>years, and also announced that Treasury officials would </p><p>travel to Washington August 18 to discuss U.S. assistance. </p><p>There were, he said, no impediments to the U.S. release of </p><p>$8.5 billion in loans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Separately, Parliament passed late last week </p><p>legislation that should strengthen BRSA\'s hand in dealing </p><p>with Imar Bank and potentially other bank fraud cases.  The </p><p>legislation includes provisions that: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- authorize the Council of Ministers to determine the </p><p>principles and methods to be used by the Savings Deposit </p><p>Insurance Fund (SDIF) to pay legitimate deposits of banks </p><p>that are being liquidated; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- in cases where banking regulators determine that the </p><p>amount of bank deposits exceed the amount of deposits the </p><p>bank has officially declared (such as in the Imar Bank case), </p><p>criminal courts -- upon the recommendation of SDIF -- are </p><p>authorized immediately to freeze an equivalent amount of the </p><p>assets of bank owners and managers, including branch </p><p>managers, and their families.  Depending on the results of </p><p>further investigation, SDIF could be authorized to seize </p><p>assets sufficient to cover the difference between declared </p><p>and actual deposits; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- makes anyone who uses false documents to file a fraudulent </p><p>claim for deposits in a taken-over bank subject to </p><p>imprisonment for 4-8 years. plus a fine equal to ten times </p><p>the amount received from the bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) At first glance, this legislation appears to be </p><p>very similar to that sought by BRSA President Akcakoca.  We </p><p>will report further details after discussing this with BRSA. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
