(C) SUMMARY: SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE GREAT LAKES HOWARD </p><p>WOLPE, ACCOMPANIED BY SPECIAL ADVISOR JOHN PRENDERGAST </p><p>AND POLOFFS, MET WITH NEWLY REAPPOINTED FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>STANISLAUS MUDENGE AND UNDERSECRETARY FOR AFRICA DAVID </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI ON 19 JULY.  WOLPE AND PRENDERGAST EXPRESSED </p><p>USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONTINUED VIABILITY OF THE LUSAKA </p><p>ACCORDS IF THE SIGNATORIES WERE TO ACQUIESCE TO KABILA\'S </p><p>REJECTION OF SIR KETUMILE MASIRE AS FACILITATOR.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, WOLPE HIGHLIGHTED RECENT ACTION IN THE </p><p>EQUATEUR REGION AND OBSTACLES PLACED BY DRC PRESIDENT </p><p>LAURENT KABILA TO MONUC DEPLOYMENT AS ADDITIONAL </p><p>WORRYING FACTORS.  HE PRESSED THE FM ON THE NEED FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO EXERT ALL POSSIBLE LEVERAGE ON KABILA TO </p><p>ABANDON HIS REJECTION OF MASIRE, AND OFFERED SOME </p><p>SUGGESTIONS ON HOW THAT MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED.  MUDENGE, </p><p>WHILE AFFIRMING THE NEED FOR MASIRE TO BE RETAINED AS </p><p>FACILITATOR, FAULTED MASIRE\'S APPROACH, AND PROPOSED </p><p>THAT MASIRE CONSULT CLOSELY, AND REGULARLY, WITH THE </p><p>LUSAKA SIGNATORY MINISTERS MOST DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN </p><p>NEGOTIATING THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT.  THE FM ALSO BLAMED </p><p>THE FIGHTING IN EQUATEUR ON THE UGANDANS, AND SAID IT </p><p>WAS PROVING EASIER TO WORK WITH PAUL KAGAME NOW THAT HE </p><p>IS PRESIDENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE GREAT LAKES HOWARD WOLPE </p><p>MET JULY 19 WITH FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS MUDENGE. </p><p>WOLPE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AF SPECIAL ADVISOR JOHN </p><p>PRENDERGAST AND POLOFFS; MUDENGE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY FOR AFRICA DAVID HAMADZIRIPI.  WOLPE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04061  01 OF 02  241510Z </p><p>EXPRESSED ANXIETY ABOUT THE LUSAKA PROCESS, WHICH IS </p><p>"HANGING BY A THREAD."  HIS MISSION, HE STATED, WAS TO </p><p>GET THE PULSE OF THE AFRICAN LEADERS ON HOW TO WORK </p><p>TOGETHER TO REVIVE THE PROCESS AND TO PRESENT SOME IDEAS </p><p>FOR MOVING THE BALL FORWARD.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER, </p><p>CLEARLY TIRED FROM THE PAST MONTH\'S PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS IN ZIMBABWE AND HIS RECENT TRIP TO LOME FOR </p><p>THE OAU SUMMIT, SAID HE\'D BEEN CONCENTRATING ON "OTHER </p><p>THINGS" AND ASKED FOR A BRIEF RECAPITULATION OF THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION OF DROC AND THE STATUS OF MASIRE, </p><p>WHICH WOLPE PROVIDED. </p><p> </p><p>VIEWS ON MASIRE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  WOLPE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT REPORTS THAT </p><p>NAMIBIAN PRESIDENT SAM NUJOMA HAD TOLD SEVERAL U.S. </p><p>MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT MASIRE NO LONGER HAS THE </p><p>SUPPORT OF KABILA\'S SOUTHERN ALLIES, AND REITERATED THE </p><p>USG STANCE THAT KABILA\'S OPPOSITION TO MASIRE IS A FIG </p><p>LEAF FOR HIS RESISTANCE TO THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE. </p><p>TO ACQUIESCE TO KABILA\'S REJECTION OF MASIRE, HE </p><p>CONTINUED, WOULD BE TO EFFECTIVELY ABANDON LUSAKA AND TO </p><p>RESTART THE WAR.  HE DESCRIBED MASIRE\'S EFFORTS TO PULL </p><p>TOGETHER A SUPPORT TEAM MADE UP OF FRANCOPHONES WITH </p><p>EXPERTISE IN THE CONGO.  WOLPE ALSO NOTED THAT THE OAU </p><p>HAD RECENTLY ISSUED A STRONG STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR </p><p>MASIRE.  THIS, HE SAID, COULD INCREASE THE LEGITIMACY OF </p><p>THE FACILITATION EFFORT AND OFFER KABILA A WAY TO ACCEPT </p><p>MASIRE WITHOUT LOSING FACE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04061  01 OF 02  241510Z </p><p>4.  (C)  MUDENGE CLAIMED THAT THE CONCEPT OF A </p><p>"FACILITATOR" IN THE LUSAKA PROCESS HAD BEEN HIS OWN </p><p>IDEA, BUT NOTED THE DIFFICULTY OF MASIRE\'S TASK.  HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MASIRE IS A "VERY WISE MAN," BUT SAID </p><p>THAT THIS "RIVER (THE LUSAKA PROCESS) IS FULL OF </p><p>CROCODILES."  WHILE PROFESSING "TREMENDOUS ADMIRATION" </p><p>FOR MASIRE, MUDENGE EXPRESSED A NUMBER OF RESERVATIONS </p><p>ABOUT THE WAY MASIRE AND HIS STAFF HAVE CONDUCTED </p><p>THEMSELVES THUS FAR.  HE ASSERTED THAT THEY HAD FAILED </p><p>TO SEEK ADVICE FROM THE VARIOUS PARTIES THAT WERE </p><p>INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN CREATING THE LUSAKA ACCORDS, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT CHILUBA.  IT IS ONLY </p><p>THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH THESE PEOPLE, WHO UNDERSTAND </p><p>HOW HARD IT WAS TO GET THE COMPROMISES WROUGHT ON PAPER </p><p>AND WHO HAD TO "FINESSE" THEIR WAY THROUGH EACH PARTY\'S </p><p>SENSITIVITIES, THAT MASIRE AND HIS TEAM CAN HOPE FOR </p><p>SUCCESS.  MUDENGE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT MASIRE </p><p>MUST MAKE CONTACT WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE DROC CONFLICT, </p><p>AN EFFORT THAT\'S "BEEN MISSING." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  MUDENGE ALSO LAMENTED OTHER FACTORS PREVENTING </p><p>THE SUCCESS OF THE FACILITATOR; AS AN EXAMPLE, HE SAID </p><p>THAT MASIRE HAS BROUGHT IN A ZAMBIAN ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>FORMER PRESIDENT KAUNDA.  THIS IS VERY DISTURBING, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1188 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04061  02 OF 02  241511Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /008W </p><p>                  ------------------71BED6  241511Z /38 </p><p>O 241513Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6677 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 004061 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR A/S RICE AND PDAS POWELL </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, MOBS, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT:  S/E WOLPE MEETS WITH FM MUDENGE </p><p> </p><p>CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ZAMBIANS\' ROLE.  AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04061  02 OF 02  241511Z </p><p>FOR KABILA\'S INCREASING RELUCTANCE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OF </p><p>THE LUSAKA TENETS, MUDENGE ASSERTED THAT KABILA HAD HAD </p><p>NO REAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE ACCORDS WHEN THEY WERE </p><p>FIRST SIGNED; HE SAID THAT THE ONLY REASON KABILA HAD </p><p>AGREED TO LUSAKA WAS THAT AN AIDE HAD GIVEN HIM AN </p><p>INACCURATE INTERPRETATION OF ITS PROVISIONS.  NOW, WITH </p><p>HIS POSITION STRENGTHENED BY HIS ALLIES, KABILA FEELS NO </p><p>COMPULSION TO ALLOW MONUC TROOPS INTO HIS COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>FIGHTING IN EQUATEUR </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  WOLPE EXPRESSED USG CONCERN ABOUT CONTINUED </p><p>MOVEMENT BY BOTH MLC\'S AND KABILA\'S TROOPS IN THE </p><p>EQUATEUR REGION -- IN VIOLATION OF THE KAMPALA CEASEFIRE </p><p>LINE - WHICH IS EXACERBATING THE STRAINS ON THE LUSAKA </p><p>PROCESS.  MUDENGE, ASSERTING THAT SOME UGANDAN OFFICERS </p><p>HAD BEEN CAPTURED IN THE EARLIER EQUATEUR FIGHTING, SAID </p><p>THAT THE GOZ IS NOT WILLING TO ENTERTAIN THE NOTION THAT </p><p>THE MLC, AND ITS LEADER, BEMBA, ARE ANYTHING BUT THE </p><p>"MOUTHPIECE" OF THE UGANDANS.  WOLPE NOTED THAT THE USG </p><p>HAD EARLIER COME DOWN HARD ON MUSEVENI AS WELL AS BEMBA, </p><p>BUT THAT NOW IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT FORCES THAT WERE IN </p><p>VIOLATION OF THE KAMPALA AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID HE SHARED WOLPE\'S </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE EQUATEUR SITUATION.  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>"OTHER PARTIES FOR VARIOUS REASONS DON\'T WANT PEACE TO </p><p>GO FORWARD," SPECIFICALLY CRITICIZING THE GOU FOR BEING </p><p>"EVASIVE" ABOUT ITS COMMITMENT TO LUSAKA, AND </p><p>QUESTIONING WHAT THE UGANDANS ARE UP TO.  IN CONTRAST, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04061  02 OF 02  241511Z </p><p>HE AVERRED, THE GOZ HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT IS "NOT </p><p>PREPARED TO COUNTENANCE ANY VIOLATION OF KAMPALA." </p><p> </p><p>MONUC </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  WOLPE NOTED WITH CONCERN THAT KABILA CONTINUES </p><p>TO DENY MONUC FULL ACCESS, BY, FOR, EXAMPLE, INSISTING </p><p>ON CLEARING ALL FLIGHTS.  STRESSING THAT BOTH THE MASIRE </p><p>AND THE EQUATEUR ISSUES NEED TO BE RESOLVED QUICKLY, </p><p>WOLPE SAID THAT THERE IS LITTLE IF ANY HOPE FOR THE FULL </p><p>DEPLOYMENT OF MONUC AND WITHDRAWAL OF CONGOLESE FORCES, </p><p>IF THE GOVERNMENT IN KINSHASA IS NOT WILLING TO COMPLY </p><p>WITH ALL ASPECTS OF LUSAKA DISARMAMENT.  THE CONGOLESE, </p><p>HE SAID, HAVE LESS ENTHUSIASM FOR MONUC THAN THE </p><p>EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES, ADDING THAT MONUC CANNOT CONTINUE </p><p>TO BE DENIED FULL ACCESS TO THE CONGO.  WOLPE TOLD </p><p>MUDENGE THAT AN EARLY MONUC DEPLOYMENT IN KISANGANI IS </p><p>UNDER CONSIDERATION IN AN EFFORT NOT ONLY TO STABILIZE </p><p>THE SITUATION IN THAT CITY, BUT ALSO AS A MEANS TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN EXTERNAL SIGNATORY CONFIDENCE IN MONUC\'S </p><p>CAPABILITY AND SERIOUSNESS.  PRENDERGAST ADDED THAT THE </p><p>USG GOAL IS TO MAKE THE SITUATION AS CONDUCIVE AS </p><p>POSSIBLE TO MONUC DEPLOYMENT, SAYING THAT, GIVEN THE </p><p>DEBACLE IN SIERRA LEONE, THE UN WANTS TO BE CERTAIN THAT </p><p>THERE IS AN EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE IN PLACE, AND THAT </p><p>MONUC OBSERVERS WILL BE UNIMPEDED IN THEIR EXECUTION OF </p><p>THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  MUDENGE CONCURRED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>DEPLOYING MONUC, BUT NOTED THAT KABILA IS BECOMING LESS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04061  02 OF 02  241511Z </p><p>CONVINCED THAT THIS IS IN HIS INTEREST.  WOLPE RESPONDED </p><p>THAT THIS IS WHY THE GOZ\'S ROLE IS SO IMPORTANT.  "YOUR </p><p>LEVERAGE IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL," HE SAID.  MUDENGE </p><p>RESPONDED THAT "LEVERAGE IS A DIMINISHING RESOURCE." </p><p>STILL, WOLPE COUNTERED, KABILA IS ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT </p><p>ON THE  ZIMBABWEANS.  WOLPE CLOSED THE MEETING BY ONCE </p><p>MORE URGING MUDENGE AND THE GOZ TO EXERT ALL POSSIBLE </p><p>PRESSURE ON KABILA TO PERMIT LUSAKA TO GO FORWARD, AS IT </p><p>IS IN THE COMMON INTEREST OF ALL THE EXTERNAL STATES TO </p><p>END THIS DEVASTATING CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  MUDENGE\'S RESPONSE TO WOLPE\'S ASSERTION THAT </p><p>THE GOZ COULD TRULY INFLUENCE KABILA SINCE KABILA IS </p><p>STILL TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON THE GOZ WAS A COY LAUGH.  HE </p><p>SAID THEY WOULD BE DISCUSSING COURSE CORRECTIONS AND </p><p>LEVERAGE AT THE UPCOMING POLITICAL COMMITTEE MEETING. </p><p>HOWEVER, MUDENGE RECOGNIZED THAT ACQUIESCENCE TO </p><p>KABILA\'S REJECTION OF MASIRE COULD SOUND THE DEATH KNELL </p><p>OF LUSAKA. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
