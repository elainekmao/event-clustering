<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 ANKARA 008110 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, ECON, OTRA, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: SCENESETTER FOR CODELS BEREUTER, HASTERT, </p><p>ISSA, SMITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: Turkey\'s Nov. 3 national elections produced a </p><p>landslide victory for the Islam-influenced AK Party, which </p><p>thus far has chosen to follow a reasonable path with emphasis </p><p>on EU membership.  The economy is on eggshells, and the new </p><p>government will need to stick to the IMF-backed reform </p><p>program to avoid another crisis.  Turkish officials are </p><p>concerned about the possible negative effects on the economy </p><p>of an operation in Iraq, stress the need for international </p><p>legitimacy and a mandate from the UNSC, and state their </p><p>preference for a peaceful process of disarmament.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Domestic Political Snapshot </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Islam-influenced Justice and Development (AK) Party\'s </p><p>landslide victory and Establishment standard-bearer </p><p>Republican People\'s Party\'s (CHP) distant second-place finish </p><p>in Turkey\'s Nov. 3 general elections cuts the number of </p><p>parties in parliament back to only two for the first time in </p><p>decades.  More than anything else, AK\'s victory reflects </p><p>broad public dissatisfaction with business as usual: in </p><p>particular on pocketbook issues, corruption, and the tired </p><p>direction given by a group of political leaders, some of whom </p><p>have been on the scene for over 40 years.  AK has made the </p><p>drive for EU membership -- including passage of necessary </p><p>economic and political reforms -- its top priority.  AK </p><p>leader R. Tayyip Erdogan is currently not eligible to stand </p><p>for Prime Minister because of past legal problems, stemming </p><p>from his conviction for the public recitation of a poem. </p><p>However, AK will form a government with almost the two-thirds </p><p>majority needed to allow it to amend the Constitution (to </p><p>restore Erdogan\'s political rights), and may be able to find </p><p>the remaining votes needed from independent M.P.s.  Final </p><p>election results show that (1) 45% of the votes cast will not </p><p>be represented in the new parliament because they went to </p><p>parties unable to cross the 10% vote threshold; (2) upwards </p><p>of 60% of the vote went to non-Establishment parties; (3) the </p><p>traditional center-right parties, which have dominated </p><p>Turkish politics for generations, got only 15% of the vote. </p><p>While P.M. Ecevit and Kemalist pundits professed shock at the </p><p>election results, a varied spectrum of other commentators and </p><p>leading businessmen made balanced and forward-looking </p><p>assessments.   The current government under Ecevit will </p><p>continue as a lame-duck administration until the new AK </p><p>government receives a vote of confidence in Parliament, </p><p>probably sometime in early December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>EU and Human Rights </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  In February, March and August Parliament passed extensive </p><p>reforms intended to meet the political requirements for </p><p>European Union membership.  The EU Commission in its October </p><p>report praised the reforms, but stated that "considerable </p><p>further efforts are needed" to bring Turkey into compliance </p><p>with membership criteria.  It recommended that the EU: 1) </p><p>enhance its support for Turkey\'s pre-accession preparations, </p><p>and provide additional resources; 2) revise the Accession </p><p>Partnership agreement; and 3) extend and improve the </p><p>functioning of the Customs Union.  The Turkish Government </p><p>criticized the report for failing to give proper credit for </p><p>the reform effort, but remains committed to EU membership. </p><p>With strong U.S. support, Turkey is lobbying EU officials and </p><p>member states.  The Turkish Government wants the EU at its </p><p>December 12-13 Summit in Copenhagen to set a date to begin </p><p>accession talks.  Some EU-member-state leaders have raised </p><p>the possibility of a "conditional date," contingent upon </p><p>further reforms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The three reform packages are focused on improving human </p><p>rights, applying to such areas as free speech, pre-trial </p><p>detention, and the rights of religious groups, among others. </p><p>Parliament abolished the death penalty during peacetime and </p><p>lifted bans on private courses and TV broadcasts in Kurdish </p><p>and other non-Turkish languages. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Turkish government does not recognize the ecumenical </p><p>nature of the Patriarchate in Istanbul.  Nor has the </p><p>government changed its position against allowing the </p><p>reopening of the Ecumenical Patriarchate\'s seminary on the </p><p>island of Halki despite the Patriarchate\'s continual </p><p>requests; the seminary was closed in 1971 when the Turkish </p><p>government nationalized private institutions of higher </p><p>learning.  In October, the Ambassador accompanied a </p><p>delegation from the Archons of the Order of Saint Andrew the </p><p>Apostle in New York during a visit to the Patriarchate and </p><p>Halki and meetings in Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Economic Situation </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Turkey\'s financial situation remains fragile, with the </p><p>main vulnerability being the country\'s ability to continue </p><p>servicing a large sovereign debt burden in 2003.   Concerns </p><p>with the effects of an external shock on their own debt </p><p>sustainability underlie many Turks\' misgivings -- both in </p><p>private sector and in government -- with an Iraq operation. </p><p>Turkey has, nevertheless, performed well for the first 18 </p><p>months under an IMF-backed economic reform program.  By year </p><p>end 2002, inflation will be cut in half (to 34 percent), </p><p>growth is expected to come in at 4 percent (after a deep </p><p>recession in 2001), and the banking sector is much better </p><p>regulated and as a result in a stronger position than it was </p><p>before the 2001 crisis.  Political uncertainty, however, has </p><p>cost Turkey in terms of higher interest rates on government </p><p>bonds which will add to Turkey\'s financing bill next year. </p><p>The focus now is on the direction of the AK-led government </p><p>that will emerge in the coming weeks.  The expectation in the </p><p>markets is that the new administration must continue with the </p><p>existing IMF-backed reform program.  Any deviation from this </p><p>program -- especially on fiscal austerity and on structural </p><p>reforms -- will again cause uncertainty and interest rates to </p><p>rise.  The new government will have to do everything right in </p><p>order to retain investor confidence and to avoid a serious </p><p>financing problem in 2003 -- with or without an external </p><p>shock. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Foreign Investment </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Attracting more foreign direct investment is a key </p><p>element of Turkey\'s reform program.  Turkey currently </p><p>receives very small flows of foreign direct investment, </p><p>compared with other emerging market countries.  For instance, </p><p>Poland attracts $4-5 billion per year on average, while </p><p>Turkey gets less than $1 billion (thus far in 2002, Turkey </p><p>has only received $180 million in foreign direct investment). </p><p> Political and economic instability, and unresolved business </p><p>disputes involving large U.S. companies, have hurt Turkey\'s </p><p>business image and limited investment flows.  The AK Party </p><p>has said that improving the business climate and attracting </p><p>more FDI is a high priority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Bilateral Trade </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  On bilateral trade ties, our trade is roughly in balance </p><p>-- each country exports about $3 billion to the other.  In </p><p>order to boost trade with Turkey, the President has proposed </p><p>creating a Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ); products </p><p>exported from a QIZ enter the U.S. duty free provided they </p><p>meet certain conditions.  Legislation authorizing QIZs in </p><p>Turkey is currently pending in Congress.  Other key trade </p><p>issues involve Turkish action to enhance protection of </p><p>intellectual property rights and to reduce tariff and </p><p>non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural exports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Energy </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  On regional energy issues involving Turkey, we have seen </p><p>important progress on the realization of the East-West energy </p><p>corridor from the Caspian to the Mediterranean, which </p><p>continues to be a major U.S. policy objective in Turkey.  The </p><p>Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline is firmly on track, </p><p>and is entering the construction phase.  The governments of </p><p>Turkey and Azerbaijan have recently reached final agreement </p><p>on a gas sales purchase agreement for the </p><p>Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum, or Shah Deniz, gas pipeline, which </p><p>likely will be sanctioned by the project owners in February </p><p>2003.  The U.S. is working closely with the Government of </p><p>Turkey to help it achieve its goal of becoming a transit </p><p>country for Caspian gas to Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Greece </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Relations between Turkey and Greece are better now than </p><p>they have been in decades.  The positive climate grew out of </p><p>the personal friendship between Greek F.M. Papandreou and </p><p>former Turkish F.M. Cem and has been largely sustained </p><p>despite Cem\'s departure from government in July.  Greece </p><p>appears to have become one of the most vocal supporters in </p><p>the EU for an accession negotiation date for Turkey, and </p><p>Greek P.M. Simitis was the first foreign leader to </p><p>congratulate Erdogan on AK\'s electoral victory. </p><p>Nevertheless, potential problem areas remain in the form of: </p><p>1) territorial issues related to sea and airspace in the </p><p>Aegean; 2) continental shelf; and 3) Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Cyprus </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Cyprus issue has long kept Turkey and Greece at </p><p>odds.  Settlement talks continue under the auspices of the </p><p>UN.  We believe that there is an opportunity for a lasting </p><p>solution on the island in the context of the EU accession </p><p>process.  Nevertheless, Turkish officials have raised the </p><p>public specter of a potential "train wreck" that could affect </p><p>not only the situation on the island but also Greek-Turkey </p><p>and EU-Turkey relations.  The admission of Cyprus to the EU </p><p>before a settlement has been reached, and before Turkey has </p><p>received at least a date for accession negotiations, is </p><p>anathema to Turks.  The landslide victory of AK in the Nov. 3 </p><p>elections, however, could create some room for maneuver. </p><p>While sympathizing with Turkish sensitivities, AK has </p><p>criticized "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" leader </p><p>Denktash for his mismanagement of the "TRNC" and, as a </p><p>single-party government with a significant mandate from the </p><p>Turkish public, might be more open to seeking a solution </p><p>where past Turkish governments have remained intransigent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Armenia/Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) and Central Asia </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Armenian diaspora attempts to have Western legislatures </p><p>pass resolutions condemning what Armenians consider a 1915 </p><p>genocide by the Ottoman Empire continues to roil relations </p><p>between Ankara and Yerevan.  Moreover, normalization of </p><p>relations is likely to occur only with the resolution of the </p><p>Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, </p><p>Turkey\'s closest ally in the region; such a solution would </p><p>have to resolve the status of NK, which is Azerbaijani </p><p>territory but currently occupied by Armenia; and the question </p><p>of a land corridor across Armenia to connect Azerbaijan\'s </p><p>main territory with its exclave Nakhcivan.  Turkey has had </p><p>aspirations to play a leading role in Central Asia for the </p><p>past decade, but its initial attempts after 1991 reminded </p><p>Central Asian states of the Big Brother approach of Soviet </p><p>Russia; uneven Turkish economic growth led Central Asians to </p><p>question the value of a special relationship with Turkey; and </p><p>some Central Asian states also grew concerned that Turkish </p><p>promotion of new schools set up in the region under the aegis </p><p>of Turkish Islamic figure Fethullah Gulen was a wedge to </p><p>introduce more militant Islam into the region.  As a result, </p><p>Turkey had to scale back its ambitions.  Growth of Turkish </p><p>influence in the region will depend to a great extent on how </p><p>well Turkey demonstrates its economic vigor and ability to </p><p>maintain a moderate Islamic identity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>OEF and the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Our only predominantly Muslim NATO Ally, Turkey has </p><p>participated actively in GWOT.  In doing so, it has supported </p><p>our message that GWOT is not a war on Islam.  In the </p><p>aftermath of 9/11, the Turks issued strong public statements </p><p>condemning the attacks, and, in the face of considerable </p><p>public opposition, pushed through a parliamentary resolution </p><p>authorizing the deployment of Turkish troops abroad for </p><p>Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and the stationing of </p><p>additional foreign troops in Turkey.  Turkey was one of the </p><p>first countries to offer Special Operations Forces for OEF. </p><p>Turkey also streamlined customs procedures for equipment used </p><p>for OEF, granted blanket permission for US OEF aircraft to </p><p>operate and refuel in Turkish airspace (over 5,000 flights to </p><p>date), dispatched liaison officers to CENTCOM, EUCOM and to </p><p>Kandahar, offered the use of additional air bases for </p><p>operations through Turkey, offered two KC-135 tankers in </p><p>support of air operations, and increased its force protection </p><p>posture at US military facilities in the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>ISAF </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  Turkey was one of the first countries to contribute </p><p>forces to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) </p><p>in Afghanistan.  In June 2002, Turkey assumed the leadership </p><p>role and currently has 1,400 troops on the ground.  Turkey\'s </p><p>tenure as ISAF lead nation ends o/a December 20 and the Turks </p><p>are looking  to the USG -- their key strategic partner -- to </p><p>have a successor in place as close to that date as possible. </p><p>The Germans/Dutch have agreed to take over ISAF command from </p><p>the Turks, but have said they will not be able to do so until </p><p>March 2003 at the earliest.  The US is working with the </p><p>Germans and Dutch to speed up the transfer of ISAF command so </p><p>as to minimize the extra time (and money) the Turks are </p><p>required to remain in Kabul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  The Turkish government has consistently preferred a </p><p>peaceful solution or a solution legitimated by new UN </p><p>Security Council resolutions.  A majority of Turks worries </p><p>about the consequences of military action against Iraq; </p><p>Turkey vigorously opposes creation of an independent Kurdish </p><p>state in Northern Iraq.  However, should the U.S. decide to </p><p>initiate military operations, Turkey would likely support us, </p><p>while insisting on guarantees that its interests be protected </p><p>and seeking economic compensation for projected losses.  AK </p><p>Party has said Turkey,s position will depend on the mandate </p><p>established by UNSC resolutions.  The well-know Turkish </p><p>concerns include damage to the fragile Turkish economy </p><p>(especially investment and tourism); the potential for </p><p>Iraq,s disintegration/the emergence of an independent </p><p>Kurdish state in northern Iraq; Iraqi Kurdish control of </p><p>Mosul or Kirkuk oil fields; preventing refugee flows into </p><p>Turkey; and protection of the Iraqi Turkmen population. The </p><p>Turks will also expect the U.S. to live up to President </p><p>Bush,s January 2002 commitment to PM Ecevit that the US </p><p>would consult with Turkey every step of the way on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>NATO </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  Turkey continues to view NATO as its strongest link to </p><p>Europe and therefore places great importance on the Alliance </p><p>and its continued viability.  It supports a robust </p><p>enlargement but worries that the organization\'s enlargement </p><p>may erode NATO\'s efficiency and ability to act.  The Turks </p><p>also seek to ensure that their own influence in the Alliance </p><p>is not diluted by the addition of new members and that NATO\'s </p><p>presence in Turkey is not trimmed in the process of NATO </p><p>command structure reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>ESDP </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  Permanent arrangements for NATO-EU cooperation in the </p><p>form of Berlin Plus are currently stalled due to the lack of </p><p>an agreement on the participation of non-EU NATO Allies in </p><p>ESDP in return for guaranteed access to NATO assets.  The US, </p><p>Turkey and other Allies are opposed to ad hoc arrangements </p><p>that would allow the EU to "deploy" ESDP in the Balkans </p><p>pending permanent resolution of Berlin Plus.  In the </p><p>meantime, key players, including the UK, Turkey, Greece, and </p><p>EU HiRep Solana are working to negotiate a deal that will </p><p>satisfy Turkey\'s national security concerns and the EU\'s need </p><p>to protect its sovereignty of decisionmaking.  The Turks will </p><p>expect US backing on ESDP if they believe the EU is pressing </p><p>for an agreement that compromises Turkish national interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Military Capabilities </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  Turkey spends one of the highest proportions of its GNP </p><p>among all Allies on defense and is supportive of US efforts </p><p>to prod other Allies to increase their capabilities.  Turkey </p><p>is undertaking a serious military modernization program over </p><p>the next several years, but is hampered by the ongoing </p><p>economic crisis.  While Turkey may support the concept of </p><p>"niche capabilities" in NATO, it likely will continue to </p><p>invest in its own defense priorities given its perception </p><p>that threats to Turkey are different than those to other </p><p>Allies and its belief that NATO (i.e., the Europeans) may not </p><p>invoke Article V to protect Turkey against Kurdish terrorists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Arms Sales </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  Bell Textron has been in contract negotiations with the </p><p>Turks for nearly two years for 50 anti-armor helicopters </p><p>based on the U.S. Marine Corps\' AH-1Z King Cobra, a contract </p><p>valued between $1.5-2B dollars.  Negotiations have bogged </p><p>down over Turkish demands that Bell, while only a </p><p>sub-contractor to Turkish aircraft industries, assume an </p><p>inordinate degree of risk.  We are supporting Bell,s efforts </p><p>to develop a roadmap to reach contract signature by the end </p><p>of the year.  The Turks remained concerned that after </p><p>contract signature, the sale will get bogged down in </p><p>licensing and Congressional notification process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Indigenous and Transnational Terrorist Attacks </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  In the aftermath of the Gulf War, the predecessor to the </p><p>Turkish terrorist group Revolutionary People\'s Liberation </p><p>Party/Front (DHKP/C) assassinated four Americans in Turkey </p><p>and carried out numerous bombings of U.S. targets (mostly </p><p>private sector businesses, although two rockets were directed </p><p>toward the Consulate General in Istanbul).  Other Turkish </p><p>terrorist groups with anti-western sympathies include Turkish </p><p>Communist Party/Marxist Leninist (TKP/ML), Turkish Workers </p><p>and Peasants Revolutionary Army (TIKKO) and Islamic Greater </p><p>Eastern Raiders/Front (IBDA/C).  A renewed conflict with Iraq </p><p>could cause these groups to actively target U.S. interests in </p><p>Turkey.  Al-Qaida threats to target U.S. bases in Turkey have </p><p>been pubic knowledge for some time.  We can also assume Iraqi </p><p>intelligence operatives could plan subversive operations in </p><p>Turkey should the Turks offer support to the U.S. initiative </p><p>in Iraq.  The Turkish National Police (TNP) are quite </p><p>responsive in their role as protector of U.S diplomatic and </p><p>military interests in Turkey.  TNP has provided enhanced </p><p>coverage at our two most vulnerable facilities (Istanbul and </p><p>Adana), closing two city streets bordering each facility. </p><p>Mission Turkey is confident the TNP will continue their high </p><p>level of responsiveness for U.S. facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Homeland Security Issues </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.  In FY 2002 US Embassy Ankara and American Consulate </p><p>Istanbul adjudicated approximately 70,000 non-immigrant visa </p><p>applications -- most from Turks -- and more than 6,000 </p><p>immigrant visa applications.  Ankara and Istanbul also </p><p>processed around 6,000 Iranian non-immigrant visa </p><p>applications.  Iran\'s status as a state sponsor of terrorism </p><p>poses a particular challenge in these cases.  Embassy Ankara </p><p>last year submitted more than 295 names of potential </p><p>terrorists for inclusion in the Consular Lookout namecheck </p><p>system.  This year we have added some 300 more names to the </p><p>system.  The use of supplemental application forms and other </p><p>measures to improve our ability to scrutinize each </p><p>application has lengthened the entire process.  While </p><p>consular officers offer as expeditious service as possible, </p><p>their primary responsibility is to carry out U.S. law and to </p><p>ensure those who receive visas will not pose a threat to the </p><p>U.S.  As new Homeland Security visa requirements are </p><p>implemented, such as the inclusion of biometric data on </p><p>visas, we will have new challenges to process. </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Security Issues for Mission Turkey </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.  Embassy Ankara has outgrown its 1950\'s era chancery. </p><p>Driven by intense U.S. policy interests in Turkey, staff </p><p>continues to expand but we have no more room.  Three </p><p>buildings on the compound have minimal setback to Paris </p><p>Caddesi and are a major concern.  Efforts are underway to </p><p>consolidate the staff of the Public Affairs Building (located </p><p>in a renovated apartment building outside of perimeter wall) </p><p>onto the compound.  This will improve our security and allow </p><p>us to concentrate our resources on the chancery compound. </p><p>The ongoing facility space plan will relocate many offices as </p><p>far away from the perimeter as possible to reduce overall </p><p>vulnerability.  Current space conditions necessitate the use </p><p>of the two annex buildings along the perimeter.  While we </p><p>have deployed local guards and TNP to reduce the perimeter </p><p>threat, a longer term solution is needed  The Consulate in </p><p>Istanbul will move from the current historic but exposed </p><p>quarters to new office building, meeting security standards, </p><p>next spring. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Facility to House Consulate Adana </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23.  The lease for the current Consulate expires in 12/02 and </p><p>landlord does not wish to renew.  Embassy team began an </p><p>exhaustive search for a new Consulate site for Adana in </p><p>2000/2001 with no success.  The commercial real estate market </p><p>in Adana cannot meet our physical security standards for this </p><p>type facility.  A possible solution we explored using space </p><p>as a tenant in a wing of the Hilton Hotel reconstructed to </p><p>DOS standards recently disappeared. We continue to experience </p><p>difficulty finding options to relocate our Consulate in </p><p>secure offices. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
