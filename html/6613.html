<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 000370 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: PINHEIRO SEEKING SPDC APPROVAL FOR HR ASSESSMENT </p><p>TEAM </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  On March 20, UN Special Rapporteur </p><p>Pinheiro briefed the U.S., EU, Japanese, and Australian </p><p>Ambassadors on his current visit to Burma.  Pinheiro said the </p><p>6-day visit is to update information prior to his March 31 </p><p>presentation to the UN Human Rights Committee and to request </p><p>government approval for a human rights assessment team to </p><p>visit Burma.  Pinheiro stated that his impression was that </p><p>since his last visit in November, there has been no real </p><p>progress on basic freedoms in Burma and, in fact, there had </p><p>been some negative developments.  He told COM privately after </p><p>the meeting that he was increasingly frustrated with the lack </p><p>of progress on human rights and that he does not have any </p><p>indication that the regime is sincere about reforms.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Overall Assessment - Poor </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  UN Special Rapporteur briefed the U.S., EU, Japanese, </p><p>and Australian Ambassadors on March 20 on his current visit </p><p>to Burma, asking for their impressions of recent developments </p><p>on human rights in the country.  Pinheiro said his impression </p><p>is that there has been no progress on basic freedoms since </p><p>his last visit in November 2002 and, in fact, he believes </p><p>there have been some negative developments.  He cited as </p><p>examples the increase in harassment of the NLD and Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi, the lack of cooperation with the ILO on forced </p><p>labor, and the failure to release any political prisoners </p><p>until just days before his visit.  Pinheiro said it is </p><p>becoming increasingly apparent to him that the SPDC does not </p><p>want dialogue with the NLD at this time.  Meanwhile, he said, </p><p>the SPDC\'s recent diplomatic achievements, such as the recent </p><p>visit of the Thai Princess and the Bangladeshi Prime </p><p>Minister, help mitigate international pressure for reform. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Pinheiro said he was seeking current information on </p><p>conditions in Burma for his presentation to the UN Human </p><p>Rights Committee on March 31.  In addition to obtaining the </p><p>views of the gathered Ambassadors, he said he would be </p><p>meeting with SPDC Secretary One Khin Nyunt, the Home </p><p>Minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials, Aung San Suu </p><p>Kyi, ethnic leaders, and "all the usual suspects."  He also </p><p>planned to visit Insein prison, a labor camp, and the tomb of </p><p>U Thant (the only Burmese UN Secretary General).  Pinheiro </p><p>said the short length of this visit did not allow any field </p><p>visits.  He would be staying in Rangoon, but on his next </p><p>visit he hoped to travel to Rakhine State. </p><p> </p><p>Proposed Human Rights Assessment Team </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Pinheiro said he would also seek SPDC approval of his </p><p>proposal for a human rights assessment team to visit Burma, </p><p>hopefully later this year.  Following up on the need for an </p><p>independent assessment of the Shan rape allegations, Pinheiro </p><p>said he has been back and forth a great deal with the Burmese </p><p>on a mutually acceptable assessment.  He is now proposing a </p><p>five-person team to conduct a 3-5 week assessment looking at </p><p>human rights issues including rape, child soldiers, and the </p><p>treatment of civilians in areas of conflict.  He does not </p><p>know how the regime will react to this latest proposal but </p><p>said he does not plan to continue making proposals and </p><p>counter-proposals.  If the regime refuses to accept this </p><p>proposal or if they delay, he said, he would go ahead with an </p><p>assessment and published report based on information he has </p><p>gathered along the Thai border.  He assumes that this would </p><p>upset the GOB, but asserted that they would have only </p><p>themselves to blame for not being responsive to his proposals </p><p>to assess conditions from inside Burma. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Pinheiro told the Ambassadors that if his proposal </p><p>for an assessment team is accepted, he hoped the </p><p>international community would provide funding for it.  COM </p><p>Martinez and others assured Pinheiro that funding for the </p><p>assessment would not be a problem.  The Australian Ambassador </p><p>said he had been encouraging SPDC officials to agree to the </p><p>assessment and told them that his government would provide </p><p>funding. </p><p> </p><p>Ambassadors\' Feedback </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  COM Martinez urged Pinheiro to press the regime to be </p><p>more transparent in actions it takes on human rights.  As an </p><p>example, she cited the March 16 release of 45 prisoners, some </p><p>of them political prisoners, which local diplomats learned </p><p>about only from rumors and press reports from foreign </p><p>sources.  Similarly, the SPDC announced the release of 115 </p><p>prisoners last November but never provided a list of names of </p><p>those released.  She said that, as a result, there has never </p><p>been a full accounting of who was actually released in spite </p><p>of efforts by several Embassies and the local press to sort </p><p>it out.  Pinheiro said he shared the COM\'s frustration, </p><p>agreeing that the regime does not provide information in an </p><p>open or transparent manner even when it appears to be in its </p><p>best interests to do so.  For example, the SPDC told him that </p><p>the 45 prisoners released on March 16 included 15 elderly </p><p>people, 15 women, and 15 political prisoners, but did not </p><p>provide him with a list of names.  Now, he has learned that </p><p>there may have only been a handful of political prisoners in </p><p>the group.  (Note:  The NLD says only three of its members </p><p>were released.  We have no information on other political </p><p>prisoners among those released.  End Note.)  He added that </p><p>whether it was a handful or fifteen, the regime\'s failure to </p><p>release any political prisoners since his last visit was </p><p>inexcusable and he intends to push hard for the unconditional </p><p>release of all political prisoners. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  The COM also urged Pinheiro to emphasize to the SPDC </p><p>the need to show their commitment to improving the human </p><p>rights situation by committing fiscal resources to the </p><p>process.  Setting up committees and organizations to mount </p><p>public information campaigns was pointless if there were no </p><p>fiscal resources to carry out investigations or assist </p><p>victims, and the SPDC needs to know that the international </p><p>community is not fooled by these tactics. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The British Ambassador thanked Pinheiro for his </p><p>December report, noting that with the way small segments of </p><p>his report were misrepresented by regime-backed press he may </p><p>want to be more careful of his wording in this report. </p><p>Pinheiro said he believed his December report was accurate </p><p>and that the executive summary, in particular, was a </p><p>"devastating" criticism of the regime\'s failures.  He said he </p><p>could not be responsible for how various periodicals "spun" </p><p>his statements.  The British Ambassador added that if he </p><p>comments again on the need for greater humanitarian </p><p>assistance by the West, he should balance this with some </p><p>information on the constraints and harassment that NGOs face </p><p>in Burma, SPDC efforts to block assistance, and the need for </p><p>humanitarian assistance to focus on progress on human rights. </p><p> Pinheiro said he agreed on all points and, specifically, he </p><p>planned to include more on the constraints on NGOs in this </p><p>report. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  The Japanese Ambassador stated that there is no </p><p>question as to whether the SPDC is right or wrong; they are </p><p>clearly wrong.  The key question now is how to persuade them </p><p>to make improvements.  He argued against continued sanctions </p><p>and tough rhetoric and encouraged engagement as a means to </p><p>effective positive change.  The Australian Ambassador noted </p><p>that engagement has been the policy of his country for more </p><p>than one year and, so far at least, it has been a one-way </p><p>street.  He cautioned that it has to be a two-way street for </p><p>any progress to occur; the regime has to be willing to </p><p>change. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  The French argued for continued sanctions and </p><p>claimed that the regime does respond to this kind of </p><p>pressure.  The German Ambassador drew the conversation back </p><p>to practical measures for improving human rights in Burma, </p><p>recommending that Pinheiro work with his UN colleagues to </p><p>make human rights reporting part of every UN officer\'s </p><p>responsibilities.  The Australian Ambassador recommended that </p><p>Pinheiro\'s report should be a little harsher than the last on </p><p>forced labor and child soldiers, both of which he believes to </p><p>be widespread problems, and more balanced in its discussion </p><p>of religious freedom.  The Ambassador said that while </p><p>religious activities are restricted, most religious leaders </p><p>have found ways around the restrictions and are quite active. </p><p> Pinheiro thanked the Ambassadors for their views and </p><p>promised an outbrief on the results of his visit on March 26. </p><p>Privately - "Very Frustrated" </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  In a private meeting following the briefing, </p><p>Pinheiro confided in COM Martinez that he is very frustrated </p><p>with the regime\'s lack of progress on human rights.  Pinheiro </p><p>said he has tried to provide openings for the regime to </p><p>demonstrate some improvements on human rights but they </p><p>continue to deny basic freedoms across the board.  He is </p><p>questioning whether there is really an interest in the higher </p><p>echelons of the regime for any improvement in human rights. </p><p>He is not particularly hopeful that the SPDC will accept his </p><p>proposal for a human rights assessment team.  If they do not, </p><p>and he publishes a report based on information gathered along </p><p>the Thai border, he anticipates that his relations with the </p><p>regime will deteriorate.  He would prefer to maintain an open </p><p>dialogue, he said, but without any positive action by the </p><p>regime he must report what he finds. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
