<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 NIAMEY 002216 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR MORAN; LONDON FOR YOUNG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 04/29/07 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, NG </p><p>SUBJECT:  QADHAFI VISIT: HE CAME, HE SAW, HE LEFT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) NIAMEY 2168; (B) USDAO TUNIS 091214 MAY 97 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR CHARLES O. CECIL.  REASON: </p><p>1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  WHAT HE LEFT BEHIND WILL BECOME MORE </p><p>APPARENT IN THE COMING DAYS.  QADHAFI STAYED ABOUT 24 </p><p>HOURS.  THE MAIN PUBLIC EVENT WAS HIS ADDRESS TO THE </p><p>FAITHFUL AT THE NIAMEY MOSQUE THURSDAY AFTERNOON, IN </p><p>WHICH HE CALLED FOR THE ABANDONMENT OF THE FRENCH </p><p>LANGUAGE IN FAVOR OF ARABIC, AND THE REPLACEMENT OF THE </p><p>WESTERN, "COLONIALIST" SOLAR CALENDAR BY THE LUNAR </p><p>CALENDAR.  NIGERIENS LINED THE STREETS TO WELCOME HIM, </p><p>BUT IN NUMBERS NOWHERE NEAR THE MILLION CLAIMED BY </p><p>TRIPOLI RADIO.  THREE LIBYAN AIRCRAFT--TWO 727S AWD A </p><p>737--WERE ON THE TARMAC AT ONE TIME, AND OTHER AIRCRAFT </p><p>PRECEDED THE VISIT WITH ADVANCE TEAMS.  NIGERIEN </p><p>OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT THE LIBYANS TOLD THEM THE AIRCRAFT </p><p>CAME FROM JERBA, IN TUNISIA.  OTHER REPORTING INDICATES </p><p>OTHERWISE.  SOME OF QADHAFI\'S REMARKS MUST HAVE BEEN </p><p>EMBARASSING TO BARE AND HIS GOVERNMENT.  MEDIA COVERAGE </p><p>WAS DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO QADHAFI\'S STATEMENTS; NO </p><p>NIGERIEN OFFICIAL STATEMENTS WERE BROADCAST OR PRINTED. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>THE VISIT SCENARIO </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF SUFIS TAKING </p><p>PLACE IN NIAMEY MAY 7-13 SERVED AS THE FOCAL POINT FOR </p><p>YESTERDAY\'S VISIT TO NIAMEY BY LIBYA\'S COLONEL QADHAFI, </p><p>HIS FIRST VISIT TO NIGER SINCE 1974.  QADHAFI ARRIVED </p><p>AROUND 9:00 TO A GALA AIRPORT RECEPTION COMPLETE WITH </p><p>VARIOUS DANCING TROOPS.  THOUGH INVITED, AMERICAN AND </p><p>EUROPEAN AMBASSADORS OR CHARGES (FRENCH, GERMAN, </p><p>BELGIAN AND EUROPEAN COMMUNITY) DID NOT ATTEND THE </p><p>ARRIVAL.  AFTER A LONG RECEIVING LINE, INCLUDING FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENTS ALI SAIBOU AND MAHAMANE OUSMANE (THE FIRST </p><p>TIME WE ARE AWARE OF HIS BEING IN AN OFFICIAL RECEIVING </p><p>LINE SINCE HIS OVERTHROW JANUARY 27, 1996), QADHAFI AND </p><p>BARE RODE THROUGH THE CITY STANDING IN AN OPEN WHITE </p><p>STRETCH CADILLAC, WAVING TO THE CROWDS.  SCHOOL </p><p>CHILDREN WERE DISMISSED TO LINE THE ROUTE.  MANY ADULTS </p><p>DID TOO, BUT TRIPOLI\'S CLAIM THAT A MILLION NIGERIENS </p><p>GREETED THE COLONEL IS A GROSS EXAGERATION.  THE </p><p>MOTORCADE MADE ITS WAY DIRECTLY TO THE LIBYAN EMBASSY, </p><p>WHERE NIGERIEN MINISTERS AND OTHER NOTABLES WELCOMED </p><p>THE LIBYAN LEADER AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE 4:00 AFTERNOON PRAYER OUTSIDE THE MAIN </p><p>NIAMEY MOSQUE, BUILT WITH LIBYAN MONEY, WAS LED BY </p><p>QADHAFI, WHO ALSO DELIVERED THE SERMON AFTERWARDS. </p><p>THOUSANDS ATTENDED, WITH A SPECIAL ENCLOSED AREA FOR </p><p>VIPS.  THE SPEECH, REBROADCAST IN ITS ENTIRETY ON THE </p><p>EVENING TV NEWS, WAS REMARKABLE FOR ITS MEANDERING </p><p>REPETITIVENESS AND FOR ITS CONTENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) AS BARE AND HIS MINISTERS SAT ON CARPETS IN </p><p>FRONT OF QADHAFI, QADHAFI BEGAN WITH A FIFTEEN MINUTE </p><p>RAMBLING DISSERTATION ON THE SOLAR AND LUNAR CALENDARS. </p><p>HE CALLED UPON MUSLIMS TO ESCHEW THE SOLAR CALENDAR, </p><p>WHICH HAD BEEN IMPOSED ON THEM BY COLONIAL RULERS, AND </p><p>WHOSE MONTHS WERE NAMED AFTER PAGAN GODS OR ROMAN AND </p><p>GREEK EMPERORS.  THESE PAGAN NAMES HARKENED BACK TO SUN </p><p>WORSHIP AND POLYTHEIST GODS.  THE ADOPTION OF THE SOLAR </p><p>CALENDAR IS PROSCRIBED BY ISLAM, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) THE LUNAR CALENDAR, WITH ITS FOUR HOLY MONTHS, </p><p>IS THE CALENDAR PREFERRED BY GOD.  THESE HOLY MONTHS </p><p>ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS, SAID QADHAFI.  IF MANKIND HAD RESPECTED THESE </p><p>HOLY MONTHS, PEACE WOULD HAVE PREVAILED EVERYWHERE </p><p>WHERE WAR NOW RAGES, MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN THE </p><p>DECISIONS OF THE U.N. AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH, </p><p>LIKE THE SOLAR CALENDAR, HAVE BEEN IMPOSED BY </p><p>COLONIALISM. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) HE THEN TURNED TO THE FRENCH LANGUAGE.  FRENCH </p><p>COLONIALISM HAD IMPOSED.ITS LANGUAGE, ITS CULTURE, AND </p><p>ITS RELIGION ON AFRICA.  MUSLIMS MUST REJECT ALL OF </p><p>THIS.  "HOW CAN WE IMAGINE A MUSLIM WHO DOESN\'T KNOW </p><p>HIS LANGUAGE, THE LANGUAGE OF HIS RELIGION, OF HIS </p><p>KORAN, OF HIS GOD?" ASKED QADHAFI RHETORICALLY.  "GOD </p><p>DOESN\'T KNOW FRENCH.  MUMAMMAD DIDN\'T KNOW FRENCH.  THE </p><p>COMPANIONS OF THE PROPHET DIDN\'T KNOW FRENCH.  THE </p><p>MECCANS AND MEDINANS AND THE KORAN ITSELF DON\'T KNOW </p><p>FRENCH.  AFTER REPEATING THESE THEMES IN VARIOUS WAYS, </p><p>TRANSLATED CLEARLY AND PRECISELY BY THE INTERPRETER </p><p>INTO FRENCH FOR THE AUDIENCE, QADHAFI THEN CALLED FOR A </p><p>NEW EFFORT, STARTING YESTERDAY, THE FIRST DAY OF THE </p><p>NEW MUSLIM YEAR 1418, FOR A SPECIAL EFFORT, A SACRED </p><p>BATTLE, TO RID THE WORLD OF ALL COLONIAL HERITAGE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) THERE WERE EVENING FUNCTIONS TO WHICH NON- </p><p>MUSLIMS WERE NOT INVITED.  QADHAFI DEPARTED FRIDAY </p><p>MORNING FOR KANO. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>ATMOSPHERICS AND ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) AIRCRAFT:  THREE LIBYAN AIRCRAFT WERE ON THE </p><p>TARMAC AT ONE TIME.  THE SECURITY TEAM\'S AIRCRAFT WAS A </p><p>BOEING 737 WITH TAIL NUMBER SA-DNJ.  ONE OF TWO 727S </p><p>WAS QADHAFI\'S, PROBABLY WITH TAIL NUMBER SA-DIC.  OTHER </p><p>TAIL NUMBER WAS NOT AVAILABLE.  FOLLOWING THE DCM\'S TWO </p><p>DEMARCHES OF WEDNESDAY, THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE </p><p>MFA CALLED THIS MORNING TO REAFFIRM THAT LIBYAN </p><p>OFFICIALS HAD TOLD THE NIGERIENS THAT THE AIRCRAFT HAD </p><p>DEPARTED FROM JERBA, IN TUNISIA.  WHEN THE DCM NOTED </p><p>THAT THE AIRCRAFT WERE IN ANY CASE LIBYAN, AND ASKED IF </p><p>THE GON WOULD BE NOLDING ANY OF THEM, THE SEC-GEN </p><p>REPLIED THAT HE HAD NO INFORMATION ON THAT POINT.  WE </p><p>HAVE OTHER REPORTS THAT CHARTERED TUNISIAN AIRCRAFT, </p><p>AND POSSIBLY A BULGARIAN AIRCRAFT, ARRIVED BEFORE </p><p>QADHAFI WITH ADVANCE PARTY.  WE DO NOT KNOW HOW THE </p><p>CADILLAC GOT HERE.  SECURITY WAS VERY HEAVY.  LYBIAN </p><p>UNIFORMED TROOPS, INCLUDING QADHAFI\'S FEMALE, MACHINE- </p><p>GUN TOTING GUARDS, WERE PRESENT AT THE AIRPORT, IN THE </p><p>MOTORCADE AND IN AND OUTSIDE OF THE LYBIAN EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) BARE: TV COVERAGE SHOWED A SOMBER AND </p><p>RESTRAINED PRESIDENT BARE, SEEMINGLY TENSE.  SMILES </p><p>COULD ONLY BE SEEN WHEN WAVING FROM THE CADILLAC. NONE </p><p>OF BARE\'S STATEMENTS WERE COVERED BY THE GOVERNMENT TV </p><p>OR NEWSPAPER.  MEDIA ATTENTION WAS EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED </p><p>ON QADHAFI. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) AN EDITORIAL IN TODAY\'S GOVERNMENT PAPER, LE </p><p>SAHEL, EXPLAINED THE VISIT AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>--"IN OUR POLICY OF GOOD-NEIGHBORLINESS, IT IS </p><p>INDISPENSABLE TO MAINTAIN PERMANENT CONTACT AND </p><p>DIALOGUE.  IT WAS IN THESE TERMS THAT PRESIDENT BARE </p><p>DEFINED HIS RECENT VISIT TO LIBYA." </p><p> </p><p>--"NIGER...DESIROUS OF MAINTAINING PEACE AND SECURITY </p><p>BOTH INTERNALLY AS WELL AS IN THE SUB-REGION INTENDS TO </p><p>NOURISH RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING WITH </p><p>ALL COUNTRIES WITH WHICH IT SHARES A COMMON BORDER." </p><p> </p><p>--"THERE ARE NUMEROUS NIGERIENS WHO LIVE AND WORK IN </p><p>LIBYA." </p><p> </p><p>--"NIGER AND LIBYA...ARE TWO SISTER-COUNTRIES CONDEMNED </p><p>TO COOPERATE AND LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE AWD RECIPROCAL </p><p>UNDERSTANDING." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) IT IS IN NIGER\'S INTERESTS THAT IT NOT INCUR </p><p>LIBYAN HOSTILITY, AS IT CLEARLY DID WHEN IT RE- </p><p>ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL LATE LAST YEAR. </p><p>NIGER IS SEEKING ANY LEVERAGE AVAILABLE TO SECURE THE </p><p>RELEASE OF THE CANADIAN AND NIGERIEN HOSTAGES HELD BY </p><p>TOUBOU TRIBESMEN IN THE NORTH.  MANY NGOS HAVE WRITTEN </p><p>THE GON IN RECENT WEEKS, STRESSING THE NECESSITY OF </p><p>BRINGING TNE HOSTAGE SITUATION TO AN END IF THESE NGOS </p><p>ARE TO BE EXPECTED TO CARRY OUT PROJECTS IN THE </p><p>NORTHERN AND EASTERN REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE GON </p><p>NEEDS TNE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE NGOS AND IS SEARCHING </p><p>FOR ANY HELP, INCLUDING LIBYAN, TO BRING IT TO AN END. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) TO THE EXTENT THAT THE USG CARES ABOUT HUNT </p><p>OIL\'S ABILITY TO DRILL ITS WELLS IN THE NORTH OF NIGER </p><p>WITHOUT ITS EMPLOYEES BEING TAKEN HOSTAGE, OR WITHOUT </p><p>LIBYA ASSERTING CLAIMS TO NIGER\'S UNDEMARCATED </p><p>FRONTIER, IT IS IN THE USG\'S INTEREST THAT NIGER-LIBYAN </p><p>RELATIONS BE FREE OF RANCOR. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) MANY OF THE NIGERIENS ON THE STREET, BESIDES </p><p>THE SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO WERE TAKEN THERE BY THEIR </p><p>TEACHERS, WERE THERE OUT OF A MIXTURE OF MOTIVATIONS. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT ASKED THEM TO LINE THE STREETS; THOSE </p><p>WHO SUPPORT THIS GOVERNMENT DID SO, BUT SO DID OTHERS. </p><p>(LE SANEL MADE A POINT OF THANKING FRDD LEADERS FOR </p><p>ENCOURAGING TNEIR MEMBERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATION OF PUBLIC WELCOME.)  MANY NIGERIENS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LITTLE EDUCATION, ASSOCIATE LIBYA </p><p>WITH A POSITIVE IMAGE OF MONEY, WORK, AND CONSUMER </p><p>GOODS; THEY WANT THE BORDER OPEN, SO THEY CAN WORK AND </p><p>BRING GOODS HOME.  THEY ARE LESS CONSCIOUS OF THE </p><p>OPINION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CONCERNING </p><p>COLONEL QADHAFI. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) WESTERNERS WHO DON\'T NORMALLY LISTEN TO COLONEL </p><p>QADHAFI, OR READ HIS SPEECHES, MAY OVERREACT TO HIS </p><p>REPETITIOUS, SIMPLISTIC, ANTI-WESTERN EXHORTATIONS. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, MOST EDUCATED NIGERIENS VALUE THEIR </p><p>FRENCH EDUCATION AND THEIR AFFINITY FOR FRENCH CULTURE, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY CRITICIZE FRENCH GOVERNMENT POLICY </p><p>AND HEAVY-HANDEDNESS IN SEEKING ECONOMIC DOMINATION </p><p>OVER FRANCOPNONE COUNTRIES.  THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO </p><p>LEARN ARABIC NOR ADOPT THE LUNAR CALENDAR.  HEARING THE </p><p>LEADER OF A RICH NATION ADVOCATE SUCH MEASURES IN ALL </p><p>SERIOUSNES MAY BOTH AMUSE THEM AND PUT THEM ON GUARD. </p><p>THIS IS NOT A MAN ONE WANTS TO GET ON THE WRONG SIDE </p><p>OF.  THE LESS EDUCATED, HOWEVER, MAY FIND HIS </p><p>SIMPLISTIC AND REPETITIVE ARGUMENTS EASY TO UNDERSTAND </p><p>AND REPEAT, AND LOOK TO RELIGION FOR SURCEASE OF SORROW </p><p>IN TIMES OF ECONOMIC DEPRIVATION.  BECAUSE THERE ARE A </p><p>LOT MORE OF THE LATTER IN NIGER THAN OF THE FORMER (THE </p><p>EDUCATED) ANY NIGERIEN GOVERNMENT MUST TREAT QADHAFI </p><p>WITH CARE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CECIL </p><p></p></div>
