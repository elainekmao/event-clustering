NORTHEASTERN VIETNAM\'S QUANG NINH PROVINCE IS </p><p>BLESSED WITH TWO NATURAL ENDOWMENTS: ABUNDANT HIGH- </p><p>QUALITY COAL AND STRIKING SCENERY.  IT CONTAINS MORE </p><p>THAN NINETY PERCENT OF VIETNAM\'S COAL RESERVES AND </p><p>MINES TEN MILLION TONS A YEAR.  LIKE MANY OTHER </p><p>VIETNAMESE STATE-OWNED SECTORS, HOWEVER, THE COAL </p><p>INDUSTRY IS BURDENED WITH EXCESS LABOR AND PRODUCTION </p><p>CAPACITY GREATLY EXCEEDS DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN DEMAND. </p><p>WORKING CONDITIONS MAY HAVE IMPROVED IN RECENT YEARS </p><p>BUT REMAIN DIFFICULT.  INCONGRUOUSLY, THE PROVINCE\'S </p><p>COAL TERMINAL IS LOCATED AT HALONG BAY, VIETNAM\'S </p><p>PREMIER TOURIST ATTRACTION. </p><p> </p><p>2. HALONG BAY, DESIGNATED A `WORLD HERITAGE SITE\' BY </p><p>UNESCO, ATTRACTS INCREASING NUMBERS OF VIETNAMESE AND </p><p>FOREIGN TOURISTS EVERY YEAR.  PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS </p><p>HAVE ADOPTED A STRATEGY OF PROMOTING AND DEVELOPING </p><p>TOURISM AS THE SECOND PILLAR OF QUANG NINH\'S ECONOMY. </p><p>EVENTUALLY QUANG NINH PLANS TO RELOCATE ITS COAL PORT </p><p>FURTHER TO THE NORTH, AWAY FROM THE ENVIRONMENTALLY </p><p>SENSITIVE TOURIST AREAS.  OFFICIAL AND PUBLIC </p><p>AWARENESS OF THE NEED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT MAY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01298  01 OF 03  131022Z </p><p>BE GROWING AS WORKERS SEE THE IMPACT OF POLLUTION ON </p><p>THEIR DAILY LIVES.  SOME EXPERTS HAVE WARNED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT DAMAGE TO THE HALONG BAY ENVIRONMENT </p><p>ALREADY IS EXTENSIVE AND IS CONTINUING. </p><p> </p><p>3. QUANG NINH\'S OTHER ECONOMIC ASSET MAY BE CHINA, </p><p>ITS GIANT NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH.  THE PROVINCE HAS </p><p>ACTIVELY COURTED CHINESE TRADERS, INVESTORS, AND </p><p>TOURISTS SINCE THE BORDER WAS RE-OPENED TEN YEARS </p><p>AGO.  THERE IS A VISA WAIVER PROGRAM FOR SHORT-TERM </p><p>VISITORS AND THE ROAD FROM THE BORDER TO HALONG CITY </p><p>HAS BEEN IMPROVED.  THERE ALSO IS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>SMUGGLING ACROSS THE BORDER, WHICH ONE OFFICIAL </p><p>DESCRIBED AS \'NORMAL FOR VIETNAMESE\'.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4. DURING A RECENT VISIT TO QUANG NINH PROVINCE IN </p><p>NORTHEASTERN VIETNAM, ECONOFFS DISCUSSED ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT WITH PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE VICE </p><p>CHAIRMAN NGUYEN VAN MIEN AND OTHER PROVINCIAL </p><p>OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF VINACOAL, </p><p>VIETNAM\'S STATE-OWNED COAL PRODUCTION AND EXPORT </p><p>MONOPOLY.  DUE TO ITS LOCATION ALONG THE CHINESE </p><p>BORDER AND THE GULF OF TONKIN, AND TO ITS RELATIVELY </p><p>DEVELOPED AND OUTWARD-ORIENTED ECONOMY, THE PROVINCE </p><p>IS MORE ACCUSTOMED TO RELATIONS WITH FOREIGNERS THAN </p><p>MOST NON-URBAN AREAS OF VIETNAM.  IT ALSO BOASTS A </p><p>POPULATION OF 1.4 MILLION AND THE ONLY DEEP-WATER </p><p>PORT IN NORTHERN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>COAL IS KING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01298  01 OF 03  131022Z </p><p>------------ </p><p>5. FOR DECADES COAL HAS BEEN THE ECONOMIC LIFEBLOOD </p><p>OF QUANG NINH, WHICH CONTAINS MORE THAN NINETY </p><p>PERCENT OF VIETNAM\'S COAL RESERVES.   WITH AT LEAST </p><p>3.6 BILLION TONS OF HIGH QUALITY ANTHRACITE COAL </p><p>STILL IN THE GROUND, AND ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF TEN </p><p>MILLION TONS, THE PROVINCE EXPECTS THIS SITUATION TO </p><p>CONTINUE INDEFINITELY.  QUANG NINH CURRENTLY EXPORTS </p><p>3.5-3.8 MILLION TONS OF ITS COAL EVERY YEAR. </p><p>VINACOAL REPRESENTATIVES CLAIMED THEIR PRODUCTION </p><p>CAPACITY WAS 16-18 MILLION TONS PER YEAR BUT LIMITED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FORCES THEM TO REDUCE OUTPUT. </p><p> </p><p>6. ACCORDING TO DIRECTOR NGO KHAC HOA OF VINACOAL\'S </p><p>QUANG NINH SUBSIDIARY, COAL FROM THE LOCAL OPEN-PIT </p><p>MINES IS OF HIGH QUALITY, YIELDING 7-8,000 </p><p>KILOCALORIES PER KILOGRAM WITH 0.5 PERCENT SULFUR, 4- </p><p>8 PERCENT MOISTURE, AND 6-8 PERCENT VOLATILE MATTER. </p><p>THE MINES USE EQUIPMENT IMPORTED FROM JAPAN, GERMANY, </p><p>AND THE U.S. (CATERPILLAR).  ONE MINE VISITED BY </p><p>EMBOFFS EMPLOYS 4,500 PEOPLE, MORE THAN HALF OF WHOM </p><p>ARE MANUAL LABORERS.  DIRECTOR HOA SAID A MINE OF </p><p>SIMILAR SIZE IN THE U.S. WOULD EMPLOY JUST 300-500 </p><p>PEOPLE, BUT IN VIETNAM MINES WERE MUCH LESS </p><p>MECHANIZED.  HE ADDED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CREATE AS </p><p>MANY JOBS AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. IN 1999 PRODUCTION EXCEEDED DEMAND AND THE </p><p>PROVINCE ACCUMULATED HUGE STOCKPILES OF UNSOLD COAL. </p><p>THE AVERAGE WORK WEEK WAS REDUCED FROM 26-30 DAYS PER </p><p>MONTH TO 18-22 DAYS, WITH PAY RATES ALLEGEDLY </p><p>UNCHANGED AT ABOUT 900,000 VIETNAMESE DONG (USD 64) </p><p>PER MONTH.  (NOTE: BY VIETNAMESE STANDARDS THIS WOULD </p><p>BE A GOOD SALARY.  PRESS REPORTS FROM 1999, HOWEVER, </p><p>INDICATE WORKER SALARIES WERE CUT TO AS LITTLE AS </p><p>300,000 DONG PER MONTH DURING THE CUTBACKS, AND A </p><p>LARGE NUMBER OF WORKERS WERE TEMPORARILY RELEASED. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>8. ALSO IN 1999, THE COAL COMPANY INSTITUTED A LIFE </p><p>INSURANCE PLAN FOR THE WORKERS, ALTHOUGH OFFICIALS </p><p>CLAIMED THERE WERE `VERY FEW\' ACCIDENTS.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO STATISTICS FROM THE MINISTRY OF LABOR, INVALIDS, </p><p>AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS, HOWEVER, FROM 1995 TO 1999 THERE </p><p>WERE 112 DEATHS AND 514 INJURIES NATIONWIDE IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S COALMINES, MOST PRESUMABLY IN QUANG NINH. </p><p>IN JANUARY 1999 A METHANE EXPLOSION IN QUANG NINH </p><p>KILLED 19 WORKERS AND INJURED 12.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>DIRECTOR HOA SAID THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR WORKERS </p><p>NOW WAS MUCH BETTER THAN TEN YEARS AGO. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01298  02 OF 03  131023Z </p><p>9. COAL FROM THE QUANG NINH MINES IS TRANSPORTED VIA </p><p>CONVEYOR BELTS AND TRUCKS TO THE NEARBY COAL PORT, </p><p>OWNED AND OPERATED BY ANOTHER VINACOAL SUBSIDIARY. </p><p>THE PORT, BUILT IN 1924 BY THE FRENCH COLONISTS, CAN </p><p>HANDLE 10,000 TONS AND TEN SHIPS PER DAY.  COMPANY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES CLAIMED THE TERMINAL, AT THE END OF A </p><p>40 KILOMETER PASSAGEWAY THROUGH THE ISLANDS OF HALONG </p><p>BAY, COULD ACCOMMODATE SHIPS UP TO 65,000 TONS. </p><p>LARGE SHIPS, HOWEVER, COULD ONLY BE PARTIALLY LOADED </p><p>AT DOCKSIDE BEFORE HAVING TO MOVE TO DEEPER WATER TO </p><p>COMPLETE THE LOADING BY BARGE. </p><p> </p><p>10. ASIDE FROM COAL AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, THE </p><p>QUANG NINH GOVERNMENT HOPES TO DEVELOP SEVEN </p><p>INDUSTRIAL ZONES FOR LIGHT, NON-POLLUTING INDUSTRIES </p><p>SUCH AS FOOD PROCESSING.  IT ALSO WANTS TO EXPAND ITS </p><p>PORT FACILITIES AND THE SMALL SHIPBUILDING SECTOR AND </p><p>TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE PROVINCE ACTIVELY SEEKS FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTMENT, WHICH ALREADY TOTALS NEARLY USD 900 </p><p>MILLION IN 35 PROJECTS.  MOST OF THE FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTORS ARE FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA, JAPAN, SOUTH </p><p>KOREA, AND TAIWAN. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>TOURISM: THE FUTURE? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>11. FAMOUS FOR ITS 3,000 LIMESTONE KARST ISLANDS </p><p>JUTTING FROM CLEAR BLUE WATERS, QUANG NINH\'S 1,500 </p><p>SQUARE KILOMETER HALONG BAY IN THE GULF OF TONKIN WAS </p><p>DESIGNATED 1N 1994 AS A `WORLD HERITAGE SITE\' BY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01298  02 OF 03  131023Z </p><p>UNESCO.  EVERY YEAR IT ATTRACTS INCREASING NUMBERS OF </p><p>VIETNAMESE AND FOREIGN TOURISTS; IN 1999 THE TOTAL </p><p>REACHED ONE MILLION.  IN APRIL 1999 THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT AND THE WORLD </p><p>BANK HOSTED A CONFERENCE ON `SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\' </p><p>AT HALONG BAY TO CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR THE FUTURE </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGION.  AT THAT TIME A </p><p>NUMBER OF FOREIGN PARTICIPANTS WARNED OF A POSSIBLE </p><p>CONFLICT BETWEEN ECOTOURISM AND COAL MINING. </p><p> </p><p>12. SINCE THE CONFERENCE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS HAVE </p><p>ADOPTED A STRATEGY OF PROMOTING AND DEVELOPING </p><p>TOURISM AS THE SECOND PILLAR OF QUANG NINH\'S ECONOMY. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT APPEAR TO SEE THE GRIT AND GRIME </p><p>OF COALMINES AND PORT TERMINALS AS SERIOUS THREATS TO </p><p>THE TOURISM SECTOR, THEY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO </p><p>IMPROVE SERVICES FOR VISITORS AND ALSO TO EDUCATE THE </p><p>POPULATION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>PROTECTION.  WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>AND THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN, QUANG NINH IS DEVELOPING </p><p>ENVIRONMENT POLICIES, IMPROVING WASTEWATER TREATMENT, </p><p>PROTECTING MANGROVE FORESTS, AND CONDUCTING RESEARCH </p><p>ON A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>13. IN THE LONGER TERM QUANG NINH PLANS TO RELOCATE </p><p>ITS COAL PORT FURTHER TO THE NORTH, AWAY FROM THE </p><p>TOURIST AREAS OF HALONG BAY.  CAI LAN PORT IN HALONG </p><p>CITY WILL BE USED ONLY FOR LESS-POLLUTING CONTAINER </p><p>CARGO, AND CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW BRIDGE WILL </p><p>ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THE AGED AND POLLUTING FERRIES </p><p>ACROSS THE HARBOR ENTRANCE. </p><p> </p><p>14. AT THE COALMINES, MANAGERS CLAIMED VIETNAMESE LAW </p><p>REQUIRED THEM TO REPLACE TOPSOIL AND REPLANT </p><p>VEGETATION AT DEPLETED OPEN-PIT MINES.  THEY SAID </p><p>PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE NEED TO PROTECT THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT WAS GROWING, AS WORKERS COULD SEE THE </p><p>IMPACT OF POLLUTION ON THEIR DAILY LIVES.  DIRECTOR </p><p>HOA SAID VINACOAL WAS WORKING TO REDUCE DUST AND </p><p>WATER POLLUTION AND IMPROVE TREATMENT OF WASTEWATER. </p><p>ONE PERCENT OF COAL REVENUE IS EARMARKED FOR </p><p>REFORESTATION PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>15. OTHER EXPERTS, HOWEVER, HAVE WARNED THAT DAMAGE </p><p>TO THE HALONG BAY ENVIRONMENT ALREADY IS EXTENSIVE </p><p>AND IS CONTINUING.  ONE REPORT INDICATES AS MUCH AS </p><p>50 PERCENT OF THE CORAL REEFS OFF VIETNAM\'S NORTHEAST </p><p>COAST HAVE BEEN KILLED BY COAL DUST AND EFFLUENT. </p><p>LOCAL RESIDENTS HARVEST CORAL ILLEGALLY FOR SALE TO </p><p>TOURISTS.  ALSO, AS FISHERMEN HAVE DEPLETED INSHORE </p><p>STOCKS THEY HAVE MOVED FURTHER OUT INTO THE BAY. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01298  03 OF 03  131023Z </p><p>----- </p><p>CHINA </p><p>----- </p><p>16. QUANG NINH\'S OTHER ECONOMIC ASSET MAY BE ITS </p><p>GIANT NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH.  PRIMARILY THROUGH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CROSSING AT MONG CAI, A BOOMING BORDER </p><p>TOWN IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE PROVINCE, QUANG </p><p>NINH HAS ACTIVELY COURTED CHINESE TRADERS, INVESTORS, </p><p>AND TOURISTS SINCE THE BORDER WAS RE-OPENED TEN YEARS </p><p>AGO.  THERE IS A TWO-WAY VISA WAIVER PROGRAM FOR </p><p>SHORT-TERM VISITORS TO EACH COUNTRY\'S BORDER REGIONS. </p><p>THE ROAD FROM THE BORDER TO HALONG CITY HAS BEEN </p><p>IMPROVED AND BOAT SERVICE BETWEEN THE TWO TOWNS TAKES </p><p>LESS THAN TWO HOURS. </p><p> </p><p>17. THE CHINA TRADE AND TOURISM BOOM HAS BROUGHT </p><p>ANOTHER GROWTH INDUSTRY TO QUANG NINH: SMUGGLING, </p><p>WHICH VICE CHAIRMAN MIEN DESCRIBES AS \'NORMAL FOR </p><p>VIETNAMESE\'.  IN FACT, HE SAID, MOST OF THE FLOW WAS </p><p>NOT SMUGGLING, BUT RATHER SMALL-SCALE `FRAUDULENT </p><p>TRADE\' TO AVOID TAXES ON GOODS SUCH AS CHINESE </p><p>MOTORBIKES AND COMPACT DISKS.  WHEN QUESTIONED, HE </p><p>CONCEDED TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS AND WOMEN ALSO TOOK </p><p>PLACE, BUT SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WAS CONSIDERING NEW </p><p>LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND ENFORCEMENT MEASURES TO </p><p>PREVENT IT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>18. IF QUANG NINH CAN MINE THE POTENTIAL OF TOURISM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01298  03 OF 03  131023Z </p><p>WHILE MAINTAINING ITS PRODUCTIVE COAL INDUSTRY, IT </p><p>SHOULD BE ABLE TO BECOME ONE OF VIETNAM\'S MORE </p><p>DEVELOPED AND PROSPEROUS PROVINCES.  CLOSER TRADE </p><p>LINKS WITH CHINA COULD FURTHER STIMULATE GROWTH.  THE </p><p>PROVINCE RUNS THE RISK, HOWEVER, OF DESTROYING ITS </p><p>NATURAL BEAUTY JUST IN TIME FOR THE EXHAUSTION OF ITS </p><p>COAL RESERVES. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
