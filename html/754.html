CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>SUMMARY AND COMMENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  SPEAKING JULY 13, CROATIAN FM GRANIC USED THE FALL </p><p>OF SREBRENICA TO REINFORCE THE POINT HE HAS BEEN MAKING </p><p>FOR SOME TIME, THAT BELGRADE IS RESPONSIBLE AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST EXERT STRONG PRESSURE ON </p><p>MILOSEVIC.  OVERALL, GRANIC\'S MESSAGE WAS ONE OF </p><p>REASSURANCE THAT CROATIA REMAINED COMMITTED TO PEACEFUL </p><p>RESOLUTION OF THE REGION\'S PROBLEMS AND RESTRAINT IN </p><p>THE FACE OF PROVOCATION.  BUT HE DID LAY DOWN MARKERS </p><p>CONCERNING UNCRO\'S NONPERFORMANCE OF ITS MANDATE AND </p><p>POSSIBLE SERB MILITARY THREATS TO BIHAC.  REFERRING TO </p><p>EVIDENCE OF A SERB BUILDUP AROUND BIHAC, HE MADE CLEAR </p><p>THIS WOULD BE OF MUCH MORE DIRECT CONCERN TO CROATIA, </p><p>AND COULD LEAD TO A "WIDENING OF THE WAR," THOUGH HE </p><p>STOPPED SHORT OF PREDICTING CROATIAN MILITARY ACTION TO </p><p>PRESERVE BIHAC\'S "PROTECTED ZONE" STATUS.

CROATIAN FM GRANIC CONVOKED AMBASSADORS/CHARGES OF </p><p>CONTACT GROUP, UNSC, EU TROIKA, AND OSCE PRESIDENCY </p><p>COUNTRIES JULY 13 FOR A REAOOUT OF THE CROATIAN VIEW OF </p><p>THE FALL OF SREBRENICA. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>SITUATION ON THE GROUND </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  REVIEWING THE SITUATION IN SREBRENICA AND ZEPA, </p><p>GRANIC ADDED LITTLE TO WHAT THE UN HAS ALREADY PUT OUT. </p><p>HE USED THE FIGURE OF 55,000 FOR TOTAL REFUGEES AND </p><p>NOTED THAT MILITARY AGE MEN WERE BEING SEPARATED OUT </p><p>AND WOULD BE CHARGED WITH WAR CRIMES.  HE CALLED THE </p><p>SERB ACTION IN CAPTURING THE "ONE TRULY DEMILITARIZED </p><p>ZONE" IN B-H "UNJUSTIFIED," CLAIMING THAT CHARGES THAT </p><p>MILITARY ATTACKS WERE BEING ORGANIZED FROM INSIDE </p><p>SREBRENICA WERE GROUNDLESS AND COULD BE DISPROVED BY </p><p>LOOKING AT THE LOW "RATIO OF WEAPONS" FOUND AMONG THE </p><p>PEOPLE THERE.  GRANIC SAID THAT THE NEW REFUGEES WOULD </p><p>MOSTLY END UP ON FEDERATION TERRITORY, ESPECIALLY TUZLA </p><p>AND ZENICA, AND WOULD DESTABILIZE THE SITUATION THERE </p><p>BY FURTHER CROWOING OF AN ALREADY-REDUCED SPACE. </p><p>NOTING THERE HAD BEEN MORE FIGHTING AROUND ZEPA, HE </p><p>SAID CONFIDENCE THAT THE UN WOULD DO ANYTHING TO </p><p>PROTECT ZEPA WAS "ALMOST NIL." </p><p>- </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>WARMONGER MILOSEVIC AND PEACELOVING CROATIA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02622  01 OF 02  131536Z </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  GRANIC ARGUED THAT NEITHER KARADZIC NOR MLADIC </p><p>COULD DECIDE TO CONDUCT ACTIONS LIKE SREBRENICA WITHOUT </p><p>MILOSEVIC\'S OK.  BELGRADE WAS ATTEMPTING TO IMPOSE A </p><p>SOLUTION BY FORCE; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS </p><p>"APPEASING" HIM -- HE STEPPED UP THE WAR, JUST A FEW </p><p>DAYS AFTER A RENEWAL OF LIMITED SANCTIONS RELIEF, AND </p><p>SUFFERED NO CONSEQUENCES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE GOC, SAID GRANIC, WOULD CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO </p><p>THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE WASHINGTON AGREEMENT AND </p><p>THE CONTACT GROUP PLAN.  IT WOULD NOT RESPOND TO </p><p>PROVOCATIONS, AND WOULD CONTINUE TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT. </p><p>"EVEN THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS" WOULD NOT SWAY ZAGREB </p><p>FROM ITS PEACEFUL COURSE.  EVENTS IN SREBRENICA WOULD </p><p>BIND CROATIA AND B-H MORE CLOSELY, AND CROATIA WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE ITS STRONG SUPPORT FOR BUILDING THE </p><p>FEDERATION.  AS SOON AS THE LOGISTICS COULD BE WORKED </p><p>OUT, TUDJMAN AND IZETBEGOVIC WOULD MEET WITH SENIOR </p><p>FEDERATION OFFICIALS.

CONTINUING, GRANIC SAID CROATIA WANTED A REVIVAL OF </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS AND TO THAT END, URGED THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SEEK RENEWED PROGRESS ON </p><p>PEACE THROUGH STRONG PRESSURE ON SERBIA; TO TAKE </p><p>IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT UNCRO FULFILLED ITS </p><p>MANDATE; NOT TO LIFT SANCTIONS ON SERBIA UNTIL IT HAD </p><p>RECOMMITTED ITSELF TO THE PEACE PROCESS AND RECOGNIZED </p><p>BOTH B-H AND/AND CROATIA.  THE GOVERNMENTS REPRESENTED </p><p>AT THE BRIEFING, HE SAID, SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE </p><p>TO ACTIVATE THE PEACE PROCESS, INCLUDING USE OF UNPF, </p><p>THE RAPID REACTION FORCE, AND PRESSURE ON MILOSEVIC. </p><p>- </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>BIHAC, THE ONE TO WATCH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02622  02 OF 02  131536Z </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  SEEMING ALMOST AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT, GRANLC ADDED </p><p>THAT CROATIA WAS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED BY OBSERVED </p><p>"MASSING OF SERB FORCES" IN THE BIHAC POCKET, </p><p>ESPECIALLY NEAR SLUNJ.  HE SAID THAT ANY SERB ACTION TO </p><p>TAKE BIHAC WOULD BE TAKEN "EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY."  ASKED </p><p>LATER WHAT ACTION CROATIA WOULD TAKE IF THE SERBS </p><p>ATTACKED BIHAC, GRANIC SAID HE HOPED IT "WOULD NOT COME </p><p>TO THAT" BECAUSE SUCH ACTION WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR THE </p><p>SERBS IN "SEVERAL WAYS."  GRANIC SAID TUDJMAN\'S MESSAGE </p><p>WAS THAT IT WAS CRUCIAL TO "ACCELERATE THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS," AND THIS WAS WHERE CROATIA\'S EFFORTS WOULD </p><p>CONCENTRATE.  HE NOTED THE POSSIBILITY OF "INDIRECT </p><p>HELP," E.G., SUCH AS HVO ACTION IN LIVANSKO POLJE, </p><p>WHICH HAD "HELPED RELIEVE PRESSURE" ON THE BOSNIAN V </p><p>CORPS WHEN BIHAC WAS THREATENED AT THE END OF LAST </p><p>YEAR.  (NOTE: AT ONE POINT GRANIC SAID THAT AN "ATTACK </p><p>ON BIHAC BY THE SERBS WOULD CERTAINLY WIDEN THE WAR" </p><p>BUT THIS WAS NOT TRANSLATED BY THE INTERPRETER.) </p><p> </p><p>9.
