(C) Summary:  Energy Minister Guler is continuing to </p><p>pressure the BOT projects to cut their electricity tariffs, </p><p>threatening parliamentary investigations or legal troubles if </p><p>they do not.  The BOTs, which include U.S.-owned companies </p><p>Trakya Elektrik (Enron) and Doga Enerji (Edison Mission), </p><p>have informed the Minister in writing that they are not </p><p>prepared to change the terms of their contracts with the </p><p>Ministry of Energy (MENR).  We have raised this issue with </p><p>senior GOT officials in recent weeks -- and many times over </p><p>the last several months -- with no progress.  Although we </p><p>recognize the GOT,s right to try to renegotiate the BOT </p><p>contracts, we oppose any effort to force contractual changes. </p><p> We recommend that the OPIC/ExIm delegation, which will meet </p><p>with GOT officials May 14-16 in Ankara, focus on getting the </p><p>government to back off from its threats and approach the </p><p>companies with an eye toward compromise.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Minister of Energy Guler called in the BOT projects </p><p>again on April 10, including U.S.-owned companies Trakya </p><p>Elektrik (Enron) and Doga Enerji (Edison Mission), and </p><p>U.K.-Japanese owned Uni-Mar.  This meeting was a follow-on to </p><p>the February 6 meeting, during which the Minister first asked </p><p>the companies to cut their electricity prices (ref A). </p><p>According to company representatives, the Minister was even </p><p>more aggressive at the April meeting, threatening </p><p>parliamentary investigations or legal proceedings for </p><p>"fraudulent" contracts if the companies did not lower their </p><p>tariffs.  We understands that Doga, Trakya, and Uni-Mar have </p><p>all responded to the Minister in writing, informing him that </p><p>they would not be able to comply with his request and they </p><p>could not change the terms of their contract; however, </p><p>company reps have told us off the record they would be more </p><p>inclined to negotiate if the "gun was removed from their </p><p>head." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We have raised this issue in recent weeks in meetings </p><p>with senior GOT officials.  The Prime Minister\'s Chief </p><p>Advisor,  Ahmet Davutoglu, told the DCM he was not familiar </p><p>with the problem and asked for a backgrounder on the issue </p><p>(which we subsequently provided).  Davutoglu added that, from </p><p>his uninformed perspective, it seemed that contracts were </p><p>contracts and any changes must be mutually agreed.  The new </p><p>Energy Undersecretary Sami Demirbilek told Econ Couns that </p><p>the Energy Ministry wanted to approach the problem in a way </p><p>that did not hurt Turkey\'s foreign investment climate; </p><p>however, he said, he believed the companies needed to make </p><p>some "adjustments" based on the current realities in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) President of the Energy Market Regulatory Authority </p><p>(EMRA) Yusuf Gunay told Econ Couns that Energy Minister had </p><p>committed publicly to cutting electricity prices -- even </p><p>though setting price\'s was EMRA\'s responsibility -- and </p><p>consequently felt he needed to force the BOTs to cut their </p><p>tariffs.  Gunay, who clearly felt uncomfortable with the </p><p>Minister\'s approach with the companies, advised Econ Couns </p><p>that Minister Guler was the driving force on this issue, and </p><p>would be the key to resolving it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  Although we recognize the GOT,s right to </p><p>try to renegotiate the BOT contracts, we oppose any effort to </p><p>force contractual changes.  Post understands OPIC and ExIm </p><p>officials will raise this issue with the GOT in May 14-16 </p><p>meetings in Ankara.  We recommend that the delegation focus </p><p>on getting the government to back off from its threats and </p><p>approach the companies with an eye toward compromise.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
