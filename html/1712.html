(SBU) SUMMARY: ON MAY 17, FOLLOWING ARF SOM MEETINGS IN </p><p>HANOI, ASSISTANT SECRETARY KELLY ENGAGED IN CORDIAL BUT </p><p>FRANK DISCUSSIONS WITH FIRST DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN </p><p>DINH BIN ON A RANGE OF ISSUES, INCLUDING THE CONTINUITY OF </p><p>U.S. POLICIES IN THE REGION AND U.S.-VIETNAM RELATIONS.  BIN </p><p>PRAISED THE REMARKABLE PROGRESS MADE IN A NUMBER OF AREAS OF </p><p>`AGREEMENT\' BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, AND STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF EARLY RATIFICATION OF THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, AREAS OF `DISAGREEMENT\' </p><p>REMAIN, INCLUDING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH GROUPS IN THE </p><p>U.S. WHICH SUPPORT ANTI-GVN ACTIVITIES.  ADDITIONALLY, HE </p><p>RECITED THE OFT-HEARD REFRAIN THE U.S. HAS FAILED TO </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THE "CONSEQUENCES OF WAR", REFERRING </p><p>PARTICULARLY TO THE ALLEGED CONTINUING WIDESPREAD EFFECTS OF </p><p>AGENT ORANGE DIOXIN CONTAMINATION.  HE SAID THE GVN LOOKS </p><p>FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE LATE JULY VISIT OF </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL TO ATTEND SENIOR ASEAN/ARF MEETINGS IN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HANOI, SO THAT THE MINISTRY CAN UNDERTAKE ARRANGEMENTS.  THE </p><p>FOLLOWING DAY, KELLY PAID A CALL ON FOREIGN MINISTER NIEN. </p><p>THAT MEETING WAS REPORTED REFTEL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ON MAY 17, FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF ASEAN </p><p>REGIONAL FORUM SENIOR OFFICIALS MEETING, ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>JIM KELLY, ACCOMPANIED BY AMBASSADOR PETERSON, DAS BOYCE, </p><p>DCM HARTER, EAP/RSP DIRECTOR STROTZ, ECONOMIC COUNSELOR DRY, </p><p>POLITICAL OFFICER COLEMAN, AND EAP STAFF AID WOLFF, MET WITH </p><p>FIRST DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DINH BIN, INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION AFFAIRS DIRECTOR DINH THI MINH HUYEN, DEPUTY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01245  01 OF 04  221034Z </p><p>DIRECTOR AMERICAS DEPARTMENT DOAN XUAN HUNG, DEPUTY DIRECTOR </p><p>POLICY PLANNING OFFICE TRAN DUC MAU, AMERICAS DESK OFFICERS </p><p>NGUYEN THI BAO HUONG AND HA KIM NGOC, AND BIN STAFF AID TRAN </p><p>QUANG TUYEN FOR BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS.  SINCE THIS WAS THE </p><p>FIRST OPPORTUNITY FOR BIN TO MEET WITH THE ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY, HIS PRESENTATION COVERED A NUMBER OF AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) BIN OPENED NOTING BOTH THE U.S. AND VIETNAM HAD </p><p>RECENTLY EXPERIENCED MAJOR POLITICAL CHANGE: IN THE U.S., </p><p>THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD ASSUMED OFFICE; IN VIETNAM, THE </p><p>COUNTRY HAD CONCLUDED ITS NINTH PARTY CONGRESS.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE, KELLY ASSURED BIN THERE WOULD BE CONTINUITY IN </p><p>APPROACH BY THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IN THE REGION AND IN </p><p>VIETNAM IN PARTICULAR.  THE `HOLDOVER\' APPOINTMENT OF </p><p>AMBASSADOR PETERSON WAS EVIDENCE OF THAT IN VIETNAM. KELLY </p><p>UNDERSCORED THROUGHOUT THE REGION, WHILE "THERE WILL LIKELY </p><p>BE CHANGES IN TONE," THE APPROACH WITH EVERY IMPORTANT </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WILL REMAIN QUITE SIMILAR AS THAT OF  FORMER </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  HE SAID BOTH PRESIDENT BUSH AND SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL HAD TOLD HIM TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE IN </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH ASIAN COUNTRIES.  THE ADMINISTRATION </p><p>WANTS TO GET TO KNOW THESE "FRIENDS" TO GET A BETTER SENSE </p><p>OF THEIR PROBLEMS, INTERESTS AND PERSPECTIVES. KELLY SAID HE </p><p>ATTENDED THE ARF SOM MEETINGS TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE </p><p>POLICIES AND ISSUES TO BE IN A POSITION TO COUNSEL SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL FOR HIS VISIT TO HANOI IN LATE JULY FOR ASEAN ARF/PMC </p><p>MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) KELLY SAID ONLY DAYS EARLIER HE HAD ASSUMED HIS </p><p>POSITION AS ASSISTANT SECRETARY, YET, HE\'D VISITED JAPAN, </p><p>KOREA, SINGAPORE, AND OTHER COUNTRIES EN ROUTE TO VIETNAM, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01245  01 OF 04  221034Z </p><p>AS WELL AS HAVING  THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN TALKS IN </p><p>CHINA.  IN VIETNAM, HE HAD MET REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL SOUTH </p><p>EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES.  EVERYWHERE HE\'S ENGAGED IN TWO WAY </p><p>DISCUSSION AND EXPLAINED THE PRESIDENT\'S THINKING BEHIND HIS </p><p>MAY 1 SPEECH WITH REFERENCE TO NUCLEAR AND STRATEGIC </p><p>CONSIDERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) BIN SAID HE WAS PLEASED WITH KELLY\'S INTEREST IN </p><p>THE REGION AND IN VIETNAM.  HE SAID THE NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS\'S CONCLUSION IN APRIL SHOWED NOT ONLY THAT VIETNAM </p><p>REAFFIRMS THE DOMESTIC `DOI MOI\' OR `RENOVATION\' POLICIES, </p><p>BUT ALSO THAT THE COUNTRY\'S COMMITMENT TO OPENNESS TO THE </p><p>OUTSIDE WILL CONTINUE.  VIETNAM STANDS TO SERVE "AS A </p><p>FRIENDLY AND RELIABLE PARTNER",  HE SAID.  "WE ATTACH GREAT </p><p>IMPORTANCE TO DEVELOPING RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.  WHILE WE </p><p>HAVE DIFFERENCES, WE ALSO HAVE COMMON INTERESTS."   GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. WILL NOT ONLY SERVE THE INTERESTS OF </p><p>THE TWO COUNTRIES, BUT ALSO HELP PROMOTE REGIONAL PEACE AND </p><p>STABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO BIN, AREAS WHERE THE U.S. AND VIETNAM </p><p>HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS INCLUDE SCIENTIFIC AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION, COMMERCE, EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE, </p><p>METEOROLOGY, LABOR, AND HUMANITARIAN WORK.  THE BILATERAL </p><p>S&T AGREEMENT CAME INTO EFFECT ON MARCH 26 AND THE TWO SIDES </p><p>ARE ACTIVELY PURSUING IMPLEMENTATION.  HE SPECIFICALLY </p><p>PRAISED THE WORK OF THE TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND </p><p>MENTIONED THAT AGENCY\'S SUPPORT FOR DESIGN AND  UPGRADE OF </p><p>THE DA NANG AIRPORT.  BIN SPOKE HIGHLY OF U.S. -VIETNAM </p><p>COOPERATIVE EFFORTS IN EDUCATION, TOO, HIGHLIGHTING THE </p><p>FULBRIGHT AND INTERNATIONAL VISITORS PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS </p><p>THE EDUCATIONAL TRUST ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR FUNDED BY </p><p>VIETNAMESE DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE U.S.  HE SAID THESE </p><p>ACTIVITIES WILL DIRECTLY SUPPORT HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>IN VIETNAM.  HE NOTED THE RECENT VISITS TO VIETNAM OF  CODEL </p><p>CRANE AND STAFFDEL ATKINS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  BUT, HE CONTINUED, "SPEAKING FRANKLY PROBLEMS HAVE </p><p>DEVELOPED AFFECTING THE RELATIONSHIP."  THE TWO SIDES NEED </p><p>TO FIND WAYS TO CONTINUE MOMENTUM IN THE RELATIONSHIP. </p><p>POLITICAL DIALOGUE AND EXCHANGE NEEDS "TO CONTINUE AND </p><p>INTENSIFY."  HE EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF NOVEMBER\'S </p><p>VISIT TO VIETNAM OF PRESIDENT CLINTON.  HE HOPED IN YEARS </p><p>AHEAD FOR OTHER HIGH-LEVEL VISITS.   SIMILARLY, FREQUENT </p><p>CONTACTS BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS WOULD HELP ADDRESS "EMERGING ISSUES."  IN THAT </p><p>REGARD, BIN WELCOMED THE UPCOMING VISIT OF RICHARD HAAS OF </p><p>THE POLICY PLANNING OFFICE TO PARTICIPATE IN POLICY TALKS </p><p>WITH THE GVN.  ALSO, BIN SAID THE VIETNAMESE SIDE WAS </p><p>PLEASED WITH THE PROSPECT OF SECRETARY POWELL\'S LATE JULY </p><p>VISIT.  NOT ONLY WILL THE VISIT ADVANCE THE ASEAN DIALOGUE, </p><p>BUT IT ALSO WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE </p><p>TWO FOREIGN MINISTRIES TO COOPERATE.   HE SOUGHT "PROPOSED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01245  02 OF 04  221034Z </p><p>PLANS AND PROGRAMS" FOR THE SECRETARY TO BEGIN UNDERTAKING </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  BIN NOTED THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF TRADE AND ECONOMICS </p><p>IN THE RELATIONSHIP.  IT HAD TAKEN FOUR YEARS TO CONCLUDE </p><p>THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA).  THE BTA LAYS THE </p><p>FOUNDATION FOR THE RELATIONSHIP TO MOVE AHEAD.  ITS </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION WILL MUTUALLY BENEFIT BOTH SIDES.  "WE SHOULD </p><p>NOT ATTACH DIFFICULTIES OR CONDITIONS TO THE RATIFICATION </p><p>PROCESS."  HE ASKED REGARDING THE TIMING OF THE SUBMISSION </p><p>OF THE BTA TO CONGRESS.  HE SAID VIETNAM IS PREPARING FOR </p><p>RATIFICATION BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AS WELL AS FOR </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION FOLLOWING RATIFICATION.  THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS BRIEFED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATES ON THE </p><p>BTA.  "IF THERE ARE DELAYS IN RATIFICATION," HE SAID, "IT </p><p>WILL CALL INTO QUESTION THE INTENTION OF THE U.S. SIDE." </p><p>BIN NOTED THE U.S. HAS ENJOYED MFN TREATMENT FROM VIETNAM </p><p>UNILATERALLY FOR IMPORTS.  HE SAID DELAYS IN RATIFICATION BY </p><p>THE CONGRESS COULD RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONTINUATION OF </p><p>THIS POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) ON HUMANITARIAN RELATIONS, BIN SPOKE HIGHLY OF THE </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES ON MIA/POW FULLEST </p><p>POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING, AND NOTED SADLY THE TRAGIC ACCIDENT IN </p><p>APRIL WHEN A VIETNAMESE HELICOPTER CONTRACTED BY THE JOINT </p><p>TASK FORCE CRASHED KILLING A TOTAL OF SIXTEEN AMERICANS AND </p><p>VIETNAMESE.  HE ALSO PRAISED U.S. DISASTER RELIEF AND </p><p>MITIGATION ASSISTANCE SAYING THE U.S. PROVIDES NEEDED </p><p>SUPPORT WHENEVER DISASTER STRIKES.  HOWEVER, HE CONTINUED, </p><p>REGARDING THE "CONSEQUENCES OF WAR", THE U.S. SHOULD BEAR </p><p>"MORAL AND MATERIAL RESPONSIBILITY."  THE GVN PROVIDES A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01245  02 OF 04  221034Z </p><p>MONTHLY ALLOWANCE FOR VICTIMS OF `AGENT ORANGE\', BUT IT IS </p><p>NOT ENOUGH.  A NUMBER OF NGOS, BIN SAID, HAVE BEGUN </p><p>PROVIDING ASSISTANCE.  HOWEVER, THE LEVEL "FALLS SHORT". </p><p>WHILE HE SAID IT IS NECESSARY TO PURSUE RESEARCH, BECAUSE </p><p>THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAR ARE SO SERIOUS, THE GOVERNMENT FEELS </p><p>IT CANNOT AWAIT THE OUTCOME OF THE RESEARCH.  HE URGED THE </p><p>U.S. TO MAKE A "PRACTICAL CONTRIBUTION" TO VICTIMS NOW. </p><p>FINALLY, HE SAID TWO YEARS AGO THE VIETNAMESE RED CROSS WAS </p><p>DESIGNATED AS THE ENTITY TO RECEIVE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR A.O. </p><p>VICTIMS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) BIN ALSO REITERATED THAT THE U.S. IS NOT LIVING </p><p>UP TO THE COMMITMENTS THE DEPARTMENT\'S SPOKESPERSON MADE IN </p><p>A DECEMBER 19, 2000 STATEMENT WHICH DEPLORED PRIVATE </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT IN ANTI-FOREIGN GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACTIVITY.   HE SAID THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF VIETNAMESE </p><p>ORIGIN IN THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES </p><p>HARMFUL TO VIETNAMESE STABILITY.   HE ALSO TOOK EXCEPTION TO </p><p>RECENT STATE DEPARTMENT ISSUED HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ON </p><p>VIETNAM, AS WELL AS THE STATEMENT MADE BY THE COMMISSION ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WHICH "FAILED TO REFLECT THE </p><p>TRUE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY."   BIN ALSO CRITICIZED THE </p><p>DECISION OF THE U.S. TO ACCEPT FOR SETTLEMENT IN THE U.S. </p><p>VIETNAMESE CITIZENS WHO "ILLEGALLY MIGRATED" TO CAMBODIA </p><p>(FOLLOWING THE EARLY FEBRUARY DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS). </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) KELLY RESPONDED BY APPRECIATING THE MANY AREAS OF </p><p>DEEP COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  HE TOO </p><p>REGRETTED THE TRAGIC HELICOPTER ACCIDENT IN APRIL.  HE </p><p>COMMENTED THE BEST MEASURE TO IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP IS </p><p>HONEST DISCUSSION NOT ONLY IN AREAS OF AGREEMENT, BUT ALSO </p><p>IN AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT.  HE SAID THE ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM </p><p>REPRESENTED A CASE WHERE THERE WAS A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF </p><p>COOPERATION AND CONSENSUS AMONG DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.  THE </p><p>VISIT OF S/P DIRECTOR RICHARD HAAS WILL PERMIT THE TWO SIDES </p><p>TO CONTINUE THE POLICY DIALOGUE.   THE SECRETARY SHOULD ALSO </p><p>HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS. </p><p>HOWEVER, KELLY SAID IT WAS NOT YET CLEAR HOW MUCH TIME HE </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO SPEND IN VIETNAM, GIVEN THE PRESS OF OTHER </p><p>URGENT INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) REGARDING THE BTA, KELLY SAID THERE WAS A BROAD </p><p>CONSENSUS IN WASHINGTON IN FAVOR OF THE AGREEMENT   THE BTA </p><p>ITSELF DOES NOT NEED RENEGOTIATION, BUT OTHER DOMESTIC TRADE </p><p>ISSUES STILL NEED TO BE SORTED OUT. "EVERY COUNTRY HAS </p><p>INTERNAL DEBATES OVER RESOLVING TRADE ISSUES."  WORK IN THAT </p><p>REGARD SHOULD BE COMPLETED QUICKLY, KELLY SAID. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) KELLY EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT THE PROMINENCE OF THE </p><p>AGENT ORANGE ISSUE IN THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  HE SAID </p><p>HE WOULD EXPLORE THE ISSUE MORE.  YET AT THE SAME TIME, HE </p><p>NOTED THAT ILLNESSES ARE VERY MUCH A PART OF EVERY HUMAN\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01245  03 OF 04  221035Z </p><p>LIFE (IMPLYING VIETNAM CANNOT ATTRIBUTE THE LION\'S SHARE OF </p><p>ILLNESS IN THE COUNTRY TO THE EFFECTS OF RESIDUAL DIOXIN </p><p>FROM AGENT ORANGE SPRAYING FROM THE WAR PERIOD).  KELLY </p><p>ADDED THAT THE U.S. POLICY ON AGENT ORANGE REMAINS THAT WE </p><p>BACK FURTHER RESEARCH AND WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO MOVE </p><p>AHEAD ON THE PROPOSALS WE HAVE MADE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) KELLY SAID U.S. ASSISTANCE TO MONTAGNARDS WHO </p><p>FLED TO CAMBODIA FROM THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WAS FULLY </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND U.S. POLICY. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, HE URGED THE GVN TO PERMIT CONSISTENT AND </p><p>REGULAR ACCESS TO THE AREA BY EMBASSY OFFICERS.  THIS WOULD </p><p>BRING THE SITUATION THERE TO LIGHT, PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY </p><p>AND UNDERSTANDING.  BIN REPLIED LATER IN THE MONTH DIPLOMATS </p><p>(AS A GROUP) HAVE BEEN INVITED TO TRAVEL TO THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS.  ON THE MATTER OF THE DEPARTMENT\'S DECEMBER 19 </p><p>STATEMENT, KELLY AND AMBASSADOR PETERSON REAFFIRMED THAT IT </p><p>WAS OUR POLICY TO ATTEMPT TO PREVENT AMERICANS FROM </p><p>INVOLVING THEMSELVES IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES ABROAD.   THAT </p><p>THIS WAS A GENERAL U.S. POLICY AND THE STATEMENT WAS MEANT </p><p>NOT ONLY TO PROVIDE ASSURANCES TO VIETNAM, BUT ALSO CAMBODIA </p><p>AND LAOS.  WHILE NOTING CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS </p><p>PERMITTING FREE SPEECH, THE KELLY AND THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>INDICATED THERE ARE CASES WHEN THE U.S. WILL ACT AGAINST </p><p>ANTI-FOREIGN REGIME ACTIVITY.  IN THAT REGARD, KELLY NOTED </p><p>SOME U.S. CITIZENS INVOLVED IN EUROPEAN TERRORISM WERE PUT </p><p>ON THE TERRORIST LIST. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) AS KELLY EXPRESSED THE USG\'S DESIRE TO BEGIN </p><p>PROCESSING OF FORMER U.S. GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES (U-11 CASES) </p><p>REMAINING UNDER THE ORDERLY DEPARTURE PROGRAM.  HE NOTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01245  03 OF 04  221035Z </p><p>VIETNAM\'S AGREEMENT IN 1999 TO ALLOW US TO DO SO LATER THAT </p><p>YEAR.  WHEN VICE MINISTER BIN RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THE </p><p>U.S. DELAYED THE PROCESSING UNTIL NOW, AMBASSADOR PETERSON </p><p>PROVIDED BACKGROUND ON THE SUBJECT AND URGED HANOI TO PERMIT </p><p>THE EARLIER AGREEMENT TO STAND.  BIN SAID HE APPRECIATED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S EXPLANATION AND WOULD MAKE SURE OTHER CONCERNED </p><p>OFFICIALS UNDERSTOOD THE U.S. EXPLANATION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) THERE WAS LITTLE OF SURPRISE IN DEPUTY MINISTER </p><p>BIN\'S BRIEFING TO ASSISTANT SECRETARY KELLY ON THE STATE OF </p><p>U.S.-VIETNAM RELATIONS; THESE SAME ISSUES COME UP TIME AND </p><p>AGAIN BETWEEN MFA OFFICIALS AND EMBASSY OFFICERS.   WE </p><p>CONTINUE TO SEE EYE-TO-EYE ON SOME THINGS: E.G., TRADE, S&T </p><p>COOPERATION, DISASTER MITIGATION, DEMINING, A LABOR </p><p>DIALOGUE, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION COOPERATION.   WHILE </p><p>AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT (E.G.,  AGENT ORANGE) REMAIN </p><p>INTRACTABLE, WE CAN DISCUSS THE ISSUES AND SHARE PROPOSALS </p><p>WHICH HOPEFULLY ONE DAY WILL MOVE THE AGENDA FORWARD.  WE </p><p>CONCUR IN BIN\'S SUGGESTION THAT BOTH SIDES INCREASE CONTACTS </p><p>AND DIALOGUE AS A MEANS OF FURTHER ADVANCING THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  NB: THE KELLY/BIN MEETING TOOK PLACE PRIOR TO </p><p>EMBASSY LEARNING THAT THE GVN HAD ARRESTED HUE-BASED </p><p>DISSIDENT PRIEST FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY.  KELLY MET THE </p><p>FOLLOWING DAY IN A LESS FORMAL AND BRIEFER MEETING FORMAT </p><p>WITH FOREIGN MINISTER NIEN AND DISCUSSED THAT INCIDENT.  SEE </p><p>REFTEL.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) ASSISTANT SECRETARY KELLY DID NOT HAVE THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS MESSAGE PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE </p><p>FROM HANOI. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
