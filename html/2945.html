<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 002396 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM AND NEA; PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: UNRWA DONORS MEETING HIGHLIGHTS CRISIS GRIPPING </p><p>AGENCY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM GREG BERRY, PER 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary and comment:  UNRWA\'s May 8-9 meeting of </p><p>major donors and host governments highlighted the crisis </p><p>gripping the humanitarian agency as a result of ongoing </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian tensions.  Continued Israeli closures in </p><p>the West Bank and Gaza have severely hindered UNRWA\'s ability </p><p>to provide services and relief.  Financially, UNRWA\'s General </p><p>Fund (basic services) programs are on solid ground, but its </p><p>emergency programs are severely underfunded.  UNRWA warned </p><p>that damages resulting from the March-April Israeli offensive </p><p>will require USD 65 million in new emergency funding, in </p><p>addition to the USD 117 million emergency appeal launched in </p><p>January 2002.  (USD 35 million of these needs should be met </p><p>by the UAE\'s pledge to rebuild Jenin refugee camp.)  No </p><p>significant new contributions were announced at the meeting </p><p>and UNRWA confirmed in side discussions that Japan and </p><p>Denmark had cut their contributions. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment continued:  If UNRWA is to </p><p>continue to be the primary refugee humanitarian assistance </p><p>provider in the West Bank and Gaza, continued, high-level </p><p>engagement on access issues will be crucial, as will </p><p>continued financial support.  But as UNRWA\'s mandate becomes </p><p>even more intertwined with daily political pressures, we need </p><p>to help UNRWA focus on its humanitarian mandate and minimize </p><p>friction created by impolitic or ill-considered statements. </p><p>The key issue is access for the provision of humanitarian </p><p>relief -- any friction that gets in the way of that should be </p><p>minimized.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) On May 8-9, UNRWA held its semiannual meeting of </p><p>major donors and host governments in Amman.  The U.S. </p><p>delegation consisted of Charge Greg Berry, PRM PDAS Rich </p><p>Greene, PRM Program Officer Jan Levin and Regional Refcoord </p><p>Joan Polaschik. </p><p> </p><p>LIMITED ACCESS CONTINUES TO HINDER UNRWA OPERATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) UNRWA Commissioner General Peter Hansen opened the </p><p>meeting by telling donors that UNRWA had "never faced a more </p><p>difficult situation."  With the majority of Palestinian </p><p>refugees in the West Bank and Gaza now living below the </p><p>poverty line, UNRWA\'s services are more important than ever </p><p>before.  Yet Israeli denial of access to UNRWA and other </p><p>humanitarian relief agencies is making it extremely difficult </p><p>for UNRWA to meet its mandate.  Hansen characterized recent </p><p>Israeli military operations as a "campaign against the camps" </p><p>and reported that the IDF had targeted UN facilities such as </p><p>schools and health centers, in violation of the UN\'s </p><p>privileges and immunities.  28 new UNRWA classrooms under </p><p>construction in Askar camp, for example, were destroyed by </p><p>the IDF in the April incursions. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) UNRWA West Bank Field Director Richard Cook </p><p>provided a detailed description of the hardships facing the </p><p>agency.  Due to the closure-induced economic difficulties </p><p>plaguing the West Bank and Gaza since September 2000, Cook </p><p>reported that most Palestinian refugees were unable to stock </p><p>the food, medicines or savings to cope with the recent </p><p>Israeli military offensive.  As a result, many more refugees </p><p>are now dependent on UNRWA for basic services. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Cook said that UNRWA\'s humanitarian access is the </p><p>"worst" he has seen in recent years.  (Cook is a veteran of </p><p>UNRWA relief operations in the first intifada.)  UNRWA\'s West </p><p>Bank field office is operating at one-third of capacity, as </p><p>Palestinian staff cannot leave their homes to reach work. </p><p>Cook reported that UNRWA has the human resources necessary to </p><p>cope with the current emergency, but its talent is stuck in </p><p>Nablus, Bethlehem and Jenin.  When UNRWA tried to move its </p><p>Palestinian staff members through the West Bank to respond to </p><p>the emergency, its employees were "arrested and abused" and </p><p>one employee was killed.  (Note:  With the exception of 13 </p><p>international staff members, UNRWA relies on 4,200 </p><p>Palestinian staff members to operate its schools, clinics and </p><p>relief services throughout the West Bank.)  Cook believes the </p><p>closures will not be eased in the foreseeable future. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Cook reported that UNRWA\'s coordination with the </p><p>IDF was "as good as possible at the top," but that </p><p>coordination broke down on the ground.  He also said UNRWA </p><p>was having increasing difficulty getting any response to its </p><p>inquiries, either by phone or letter.  Cook said the Israeli </p><p>authorities had stopped issuing permits to UNRWA staff -- </p><p>including Jerusalem permits required for field office staff </p><p>-- "in violation of UN privileges and immunities."  During </p><p>the March and April offensives, UNRWA vehicles and staff were </p><p>fired upon, and the IDF forcibly entered UN properties </p><p>including schools and vocational training centers.  Cook said </p><p>the IDF "time and time again" used UNRWA buildings as </p><p>defensive positions and detention centers. </p><p>JENIN CAMP UPDATE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) UNRWA\'s first priority for Jenin camp reconstruction </p><p>is removal of unexploded ordnance (UXO).  UNRWA is unable to </p><p>remove any of the rubble or rebuild the 800 destroyed </p><p>shelters until the large amounts of UXO in the camp have been </p><p>removed.  Cook told donors the necessary equipment to remove </p><p>and dispose of UXO contains explosives and therefore -- </p><p>according to Israeli authorities -- poses a security risk. </p><p>Although the Israeli government possesses the necessary </p><p>equipment to handle the UXO, it will not lend the equipment </p><p>to UNRWA unless it agrees to photograph and catalogue the </p><p>(presumably Palestinian-origin) UXO found in the camp.  Cook </p><p>said UNRWA refuses to meet this condition, as it will impose </p><p>unnecessary and potentially life-threatening delays on the </p><p>removal of the ordnance.  (In a separate conversation with </p><p>refcoord, Cook said other nations have offered to send the </p><p>equipment to UNRWA, but that Israel has said it would deny </p><p>entry for the equipment.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Once the UXO and rubble have been removed from Jenin </p><p>camp, UNRWA will begin the 18-month process of rebuilding the </p><p>camp.  Deputy Syria Field Director Lex Takkenberg (manager of </p><p>the USG-funded Neirab housing project) has been dispatched to </p><p>Jenin to conduct a survey of Jenin camp residents\' needs and </p><p>to oversee reconstruction efforts.  ComGen Hansen reported </p><p>that the UAE has pledged USD 35 million to rebuild the camp. </p><p>Many donors expressed concern at the steep (USD 30,000) unit </p><p>costs implicit in the UAE\'s donation.  UNRWA officials </p><p>assured donors that per-unit costs included rubble removal </p><p>and infrastructure repairs required to rebuild the camp. </p><p> </p><p>EMERGENCY APPEAL UNDERFUNDED; NEW NEEDS ESTIMATED AT USD 65 </p><p>MILLION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Hansen reported that UNRWA\'s 2001 emergency appeals </p><p>were funded at 80 percent, a "respectable" showing for any </p><p>appeal.  However, the USD 117 million appeal issued in </p><p>January 2002 was severely underfunded, with only USD 47 </p><p>million received to date (including a USD 30 million </p><p>contribution from the U.S.).  West Bank Director Cook </p><p>reported that UNRWA had not already run out of cash only </p><p>because continuing access difficulties had prevented the </p><p>agency from implementing most of its planned emergency </p><p>activities, such as temporary employment creation or remedial </p><p>education programs.  Moreover, many of UNRWA\'s relief </p><p>activities during the April offensive (distribution of food, </p><p>water, blankets) were conducted using supplies donated by </p><p>Israeli Arabs and international volunteers from other UN </p><p>agencies. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Based on its very preliminary assessment of damages </p><p>and social needs resulting from the Israeli incursions, UNRWA </p><p>believes it will need USD 65 million in additional emergency </p><p>funding, beyond the USD 117 million requested in the January </p><p>2002 appeal.  Cook confirmed that the USD 65 million includes </p><p>the USD 35 million already pledged by the UAE to rebuild </p><p>Jenin refugee camp, leaving the unfunded new needs at USD 30 </p><p>million.  Therefore, with only USD 47 million in its </p><p>emergency coffers to date, UNRWA needs an estimated USD 100 </p><p>million to continue its West Bank and Gaza emergency programs </p><p>through the end of the year.  Hansen and Cook both cautioned </p><p>that the figure could be much greater if closures are </p><p>tightened or further military incursions occur.  Hansen also </p><p>told donors UNRWA likely would need more international staff </p><p>to cover the functions normally performed by Palestinian </p><p>staff who cannot move freely through the West Bank and Gaza. </p><p> </p><p>REGULAR PROGRAMS ON SOLID FINANCIAL GROUND, BUT PROJECT FUNDS </p><p>USED TO COVER CASH SHORTFALLS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Reporting that UNRWA had ended the year 2001 with </p><p>the "highest budget growth in decades," Hansen told donors </p><p>that UNRWA had been able to repay USD 8.9 million in debt to </p><p>its project fund and set aside funding for a working capital </p><p>reserve.  Nevertheless, UNRWA in 2002 expected a budget </p><p>deficit of USD 12.3 million, as its expected contributions </p><p>likely would not keep pace with the natural growth of the </p><p>refugee population.  Hansen announced that two donors (later </p><p>identified as Japan and Denmark) planned to reduce their </p><p>contributions this year. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Hansen also admitted to donors that UNRWA had used </p><p>its special project accounts to cover cash shortfalls and </p><p>meet basic operating expenses such as payroll.  Hansen </p><p>asserted that UNRWA\'s use of special project funds for </p><p>general programs had not slowed project implementation.  He </p><p>told donors that UNRWA\'s use of a unified cash account is </p><p>standard UN practice and allows the voluntarily funded agency </p><p>to keep operations running in spite of cash shortfalls. </p><p>Hansen also told donors UNRWA would be able to reduce its </p><p>project deficit more quickly if it could solve the PA VAT </p><p>problem. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING ATMOSPHERICS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Statements by all delegations -- donors and host </p><p>governments alike -- focused on the many difficulties UNRWA </p><p>faces in carrying out its mandate.  Criticism of Israeli </p><p>targeting of humanitarian workers and restrictions upon </p><p>UNRWA\'s mobility was quite strong, as was implied criticism </p><p>of perceived U.S. failure to compel the GOI to provide </p><p>humanitarian access.  In both his public statements and </p><p>private discussions with USG officials, Hansen at times </p><p>adopted a tone that seemed to push up against the limits of </p><p>UNRWA\'s strictly apolitical humanitarian mandate.  While </p><p>Hansen\'s remarks certainly reflected an accurate assessment </p><p>of extremely difficult relations between UNRWA and Israeli </p><p>government, he needs to work with Israel to accomplish </p><p>humanitarian objectives. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) If UNRWA is to continue to be the primary refugee </p><p>humanitarian assistance provider in the West Bank and Gaza, </p><p>continued, high-level engagement on access issues will be </p><p>crucial, as will continued financial support.  But as UNRWA\'s </p><p>mandate becomes even more intertwined with daily political </p><p>pressures, we also need to help UNRWA remain focused on its </p><p>humanitarian mandate and minimize friction created by </p><p>rhetorical statements.  In private conversation, Hansen </p><p>himself acknowledged the importance of carefully crafting </p><p>UNRWA statements to avoid political quagmires, but his </p><p>rhetoric sometimes threatened to get the better of him.  The </p><p>key point is the provision of humanitarian assistance; </p><p>unnecessary friction is not helpful in that regard. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
