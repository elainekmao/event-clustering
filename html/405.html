<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KHARTOUM 11067 </p><p> </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PINR, SU, LY, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  QADHAFI VISITS SUDAN; CALLS FOR SUDAN, LIBYAN, </p><p>EGYPTIAN UNITY; CRITICIZES RELIGION IN GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  KHARTOUM 11006 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  LIBYA\'S QADHAFI VISITED KHARTOUM OCTOBER </p><p>20-23 TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CELEBRATION OF THE OCTOBER </p><p>1964 REVOLUTION.  WHILE HERE, HE ADDRESSED THE CLOSING </p><p>SESSION OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE CONFERENCE ON THE </p><p>POLITICAL SYSTEM (NDCPS).  QADHAFI CALLED FOR ARAB UNITY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY UNION BETWEEN SUDAN, EGYPT, AND LIBYA.  HE </p><p>SAID HE WOULD TRY TO CONVINCE SPLA LEADER JOHN GARANG TO </p><p>END THE REBELLION AGAINST THE GOS.  QADHAFI ALSO MET WITH </p><p>THE SUDANESE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION FOR OVER TWO HOURS AND </p><p>MADE A STRONG PITCH FOR KEEPING RELIGION (READ ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM) OUT OF GOVERNMENT.  MOST SUDANESE ARE </p><p>PLEASED WITH THE SPEECH, BUT MANY BELIEVE IT WAS </p><p>COORDINATED WITH, IF NOT DIRECTED BY MUBARAK.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE HIGHLIGHTS OF QADHAFI\'S SPEECH TO THE NDCPS, AS </p><p>REPORTED BY THE SUDAN NEWS AGENCY ARE AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>HE RECALLED THAT HE AND EGYPT\'S NASSER ADVOCATED </p><p>SUDAN-EGYPT-LIBYA UNITY IN THE EARLY 1970\'S BUT SUDAN\'S </p><p>NIMEIRI WAS OPPOSED DUE TO "UNFOUNDED SENSITIVITIES OF </p><p>EGYPT AND SUDAN." </p><p> </p><p>HE MENTIONED SEVERAL ARAB TRIBES FOUND IN THE THREE </p><p>COUNTRIES CITING THIS AS AN EVIDENCE OF AN "INHERENT </p><p>UNITY OF THEIR INHABITANTS." </p><p> </p><p>SUDAN, EGYPT, AND LIBYA ARE RICH IN NATURAL AS WELL AS </p><p>HUMAN RESOURCES AND, IF UNIFIED, THEY CAN FORM A POWERFUL </p><p>STATE. </p><p> </p><p>REFERRING TO THE NDCPS RECOMMENDATION THAT PEOPLE\'S </p><p>CONGRESSES FORM THE GOS, QADHAFI SAID THIS IS A TURNING </p><p>POINT IN ARAB HISTORY IN WHICH THE SUDANESE PEOPLE HAVE </p><p>OPTED FOR THE PEOPLE\'S POWER WHICH WAS HERALDED BY LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>HE CALLED THE PARLIAMENTARY, PARTISAN, AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>SYSTEMS "NONSENSE" SAYING THAT THEY HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE </p><p>AND HAVE GIVEN WAY TO HIS "JAMAHIRYA STYLE" IN WHICH </p><p>THERE IS NO ROOM FOR GOVERNMENT AND IN WHICH THE PEOPLE </p><p>RUN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS THROUGH THEIR PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES </p><p>AND CONGRESSES.  HE PREDICTED THAT THE JAMAHIRYA SYSTEM </p><p>AND THE PEOPLE\'S POWER WOULD BE PRACTICED ALL OVER THE </p><p>WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>HE HAILED AND EXPRESSED HIS FULL SUPPORT TO RCC CHAIRMAN </p><p>AND HEAD OF STATE, GENERAL OMAR AL BASHIR AND HIS AIDES </p><p>WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS "THE FIRST SUDANESE LEADERSHIP THAT </p><p>OPTED TO DEVOLVE POWER TO THE PEOPLE BY CHOOSING THE </p><p>POPULAR POWER WHICH IS TO BE EXERCISED BY THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEES AND CONGRESSES." </p><p> </p><p>QADHAFI SAID THAT SPLA LEADER JOHN GARANG WAS A MEMBER OF </p><p>THE LIBYAN-BASED INTERNATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION </p><p>WHICH ADVOCATED PEOPLE\'S POWER TO PREVAIL IN THE WORLD, </p><p>AND HE PLEDGED TO TRY TO CONVINCE GARANG TO TERMINATE HIS </p><p>REBELLION NOW THAT A JAMAHIRYA SYSTEM WOULD BE </p><p>ESTABLISHED IN SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>HE SAID THAT LIBYA HAD ARMED AND TRAINED GARANG WHEN HE </p><p>WAS FIGHTING PRESIDENT NIMEIRI BUT NOW HAD STOPPED </p><p>SUPPLYING GARANG WITH ARMS.  HE ADDED THAT IF GARANG </p><p>WOULD NOT JOIN "THE MASSES OF THE SUDAN" LIBYA WOULD HAVE </p><p>NO CHOICE BUT TO TURN AGAINST GARANG IN SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>SUDANESE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>APPARENTLY IN A LIGHT REBUKE TO EGYPT FOR ITS </p><p>INDIFFERENCE TOWARD THE SOUTHERN SUDAN PROBLEM, QADHAFI </p><p>SAID EGYPT SHOULD APPRECIATE THAT DEFENSE OF SOUTHERN </p><p>SUDAN WOULD PROTECT EGYPT AND THAT SECESSION OF SOUTH </p><p>SUDAN IS HAZARDOUS TO EGYPT. </p><p> </p><p>HE PREDICTED THAT THE SOUTHERN SUDAN PROBLEM WOULD WITHER </p><p>AWAY IF UNITY OF SUDAN, EGYPT AND LIBYA WAS ACHIEVED. </p><p> </p><p>HE DECLARED THAT DEMONSTRATIONS WOULD BE STAGED IN ALL </p><p>ARAB COUNTRIES AS OF THE FIRST DAY OF NEXT JANUARY </p><p>PEACEFULLY DEMANDING ABOLITION OF BORDERLINES SEPARATING </p><p>THE ARAB COUNTRIES FROM ONE ANOTHER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  QADHAFI\'S EVENING SPEECH TO THE STUDENTS WAS ALSO </p><p>ATTENDED BY GENERAL OMAR.  CHARACTERIZED AS "BLUNT," IT </p><p>CALLED FOR A SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.  QADHAFI </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR RELIGION IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT, DEFENSE, ADMINISTRATION, OR EVEN JUSTICE, A </p><p>DIRECT CHALLENGE TO SHARIA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  DESPITE THE SHOW OF SOLIDARITY AND THE </p><p>RHETORIC, SERIOUS OBSTACLES REMAIN TO FULLY DEVELOPING </p><p>GOS-GOL TIES.  GIVEN THE PRIMARILY ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>BENT OF QADHAFI\'S EVENING AUDIENCE, HE SENT A CLEAR </p><p>NEGATIVE SIGNAL TO OMAR AND THE NIF.  RELATIONS BETWEEN </p><p>LIBYA AND SUDAN\'S FUNDAMENTALISTS HAVE NEVER BEEN CLOSE. </p><p>THE RECENT ARREST OF 200 "ISLAMISTS" IN LIBYA WAS NOTICED </p><p>BY SENIOR NIF MEMBER WHO COMMENTED ON QADHAFI\'S ANTIPATHY </p><p>TOWARD ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM.  THE GOL-GOS UNITY </p><p>DECLARATION AND THE FEW ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT STEPS TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT IT HAVE NOT HELPED THE RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MOST SUDANESE WERE PLEASED WITH QADHAFI\'S SPEECH, </p><p>SINCE THEY SEE IT AS A DIRECT ATTACK ON THE NIF.  THEY </p><p>ALL NOTE THAT "NO SUDANESE COULD HAVE SAID WHAT QADHAFI </p><p>SAID."  MANY BELIEVE THAT EGYPT\'S MUBARAK WAS BEHIND THE </p><p>SPEECH; IF NOT, HE ALMOST CERTAINLY WAS CONSULTED.  IN </p><p>ANY EVENT, THE MESSAGE IS THE SAME THAT MUBARAK </p><p>REPORTEDLY GAVE OMAR A YEAR AGO DURING HIS VISIT TO </p><p>KHARTOUM.  DIPLOMATIC SOURCES HAVE TOLD US THAT AS BLUNT </p><p>AS THE SPEECH WAS, QADHAFI WAS EVEN MORE BLUNT IN PRIVATE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS OVER NIF INFLUENCE, SHARIA AND SUDAN\'S </p><p>INABILITY TO FEED ITSELF IN SUCH A RICH COUNTRY.  HE ALSO </p><p>REPORTEDLY CRITICIZED THE PROLIFERATION OF GENERALS IN </p><p>THE SPAF, NOTING THERE WERE "TOO MANY STARS ON THEIR </p><p>SHOULDERS."  . </p><p> </p><p>6.  QADHAFI\'S OFFER TO INTERCEDE WITH GARANG IS PROBABLY </p><p>MORE SHOW THAN SUBSTANCE.  QADHAFI STILL MAINTAINS CLOSE </p><p>TIES TO FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER MUBARAK AL FADIL AL </p><p>MAHDI, COUSIN OF THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER SADIQ AL MAHDI </p><p>AND SENIOR UMMA PARTY OFFICIAL, WHO SIGNED AN AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH GARANG EARLIER THIS YEAR.  QADHAFI THUS HAS A </p><p>COMMUNICATION CHANNEL IF HE WISHES TO USE IT.  AS FOR </p><p>QADHAFI\'S THREAT TO TURN AGAINST GARANG, HE IS ALREADY </p><p>FURNISHING SIGNIFICANT MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE GOS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  QADHAFI\'S PERFORMANCE MAY WELL FEED DOUBTS AMONG THE </p><p>GOS LEADERSHIP ABOUT HIS RELIABILITY AS AN ALLY AND </p><p>FURTHER STIMULATE THEIR COURTSHIP OF IRAN, WHICH THEY ARE </p><p>SCHEDULED TO VISIT IN EARLY NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
