END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Akashi Reviews Plans for Conference </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) Ambassador Wills and DCM met February 13 with </p><p>Yasushi Akashi, Japan\'s Special Envoy on Sri Lankan </p><p>issues.  Akashi related that his latest visit to Sri </p><p>Lanka was going well.  (Note:  Akashi also visited Sri </p><p>Lanka in January and met with the Ambassador at that </p><p>time -- See Ref B.)  The Ambassador asked Akashi how </p><p>plans were proceeding regarding Japan\'s hosting of the </p><p>international donors\' conference for Sri Lanka due to be </p><p>held in Tokyo, June 9-10.  Akashi replied that exact </p><p>details for the conference still needed to ironed out </p><p>with the Sri Lankan government.  He planned to have a </p><p>long meeting that night with Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe plus key Ministers G.L. Peiris and </p><p>Milinda Moragoda to discuss how the conference should be </p><p>organized.  The U.S. would be briefed regarding the </p><p>meeting\'s conclusions as soon as possible, he added. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C/NF) Akashi went on to note that the GoJ had some </p><p>preliminary notions regarding the conference that he </p><p>could share.  The current idea was to have four co- </p><p>chairs -- Japan, Norway, the EU, and the U.S.  This </p><p>model had worked for last year\'s Afghan reconstruction </p><p>conference.  As host, Japan planned to do most of the </p><p>work involved in putting the conference together.  That </p><p>said, Japan was committed to consulting fully with the </p><p>other co-chairs on the format of the conference.  The </p><p>co-chairs, for example, would have to work closely </p><p>together in drafting a declaration for the conference. </p><p>Much of the work on the declaration could take place </p><p>closer to the timeframe of the conference. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C/NF) Continuing, Akashi noted that much thought </p><p>had to go into the exact role of representatives of the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at the </p><p>conference.  Japan\'s current thinking was that the group </p><p>would definitely not have equivalent status with the </p><p>GSL.  In addition, nothing should be done to enhance the </p><p>group\'s position that was not absolutely necessary. </p><p>Ambassador Wills noted that exact plans regarding how to </p><p>handle the LTTE could be modulated closer to the </p><p>timeframe of the conference per the group\'s pattern of </p><p>behavior.  Some flexibility in this regard could serve </p><p>to reward the LTTE for positive moves regarding the </p><p>peace process, while a negative pattern of behavior </p><p>could be dealt with in a different manner.  Akashi said </p><p>he thought that approach made sense. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Possible U.S. Role </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C/NF) When asked for more information about the </p><p>possible U.S. role, Akashi said the GoJ felt that U.S. </p><p>participation in the conference was important in giving </p><p>the event credibility.  Akashi said he strongly hoped </p><p>that the U.S. would serve as a co-chair and that Deputy </p><p>Secretary Armitage could participate, as he was a real </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"drawing card."  The Ambassador noted that the Deputy </p><p>Secretary was keen to participate in the conference, if </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>at all possible.  Akashi noted that GoJ representatives </p><p>had met with the Norwegians to discuss how the </p><p>November 2002 Oslo conference was structured as regards </p><p>interactions between the LTTE and donors, such as the </p><p>U.S.  Japan wanted the U.S. to know that it was </p><p>sensitive to this issue and would work closely with us </p><p>to ensure that there were no potentially embarrassing </p><p>encounters with the LTTE, including photos, at the June </p><p>conference. </p><p>-------- </p><p>Re India </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C/NF) In response to a question, Akashi said he </p><p>continued to work the India angle.  He noted that he </p><p>planned to meet India\'s High Commissioner to Sri Lanka </p><p>later in the day and his next stop after Sri Lanka was </p><p>India.  In New Delhi, he planned to meet with National </p><p>Security Adviser Mishra and some other officials.  He </p><p>would urge the GoI to participate in the donors\' </p><p>conference.  Akashi said he thought the Ministry of </p><p>External Affairs was not very flexible regarding Sri </p><p>Lanka.  Mishra was more flexible, but even he was </p><p>constrained by the anti-LTTE domestic political dynamic. </p><p>The Ambassador asked whether he planned to meet Congress </p><p>Party leader Sonia Gandhi and Akashi said he had no such </p><p>plans this trip.  The Ambassador noted that India had </p><p>made clear that it supported the peace process on many </p><p>occasions, but it really needed to take a more visible </p><p>role.  Indian influence, for example, might be an </p><p>important factor in getting the LTTE to take the first </p><p>step toward disarmament and demobilization. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Other Items </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) Akashi also briefly touched on the following </p><p>items: </p><p> </p><p>-- Prabhakaran:  Akashi noted that he had received an </p><p>invitation some time ago to meet with LTTE leader </p><p>V. Prabhakaran.  He was thinking of possibly doing so in </p><p>early March when senior Tiger negotiator Anton </p><p>Balasingham visited Sri Lanka.  Such a meeting might be </p><p>useful in probing Prabhakaran\'s exact thoughts on the </p><p>peace process. </p><p> </p><p>-- Kumaratunga:  Akashi said he planned to meet </p><p>President Kumaratunga on February 14.  During his last </p><p>visit, she had cancelled her meeting with him on very </p><p>short notice, but had sent him a nice letter of apology. </p><p>He asked the Ambassador whether it was likely that the </p><p>president might dissolve Parliament and call new </p><p>elections at some point in the next several months, and, </p><p>by doing so, disrupt the donors\' conference.  The </p><p>Ambassador responded that he did not think Kumaratunga </p><p>would do this, but it was in the realm of the possible. </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  Akashi took some flak from one of the </p><p>president\'s press spokesmen the other day.  The </p><p>spokesman accused Akashi of portraying himself as an </p><p>"adviser" to the GSL.  Akashi, in fact, has never </p><p>claimed to be that, although he is an adviser </p><p>to the GSL-LTTE humanitarian issues sub-committee.  In </p><p>addition, some anti-peace process elements, including in </p><p>the press, have hit out at Akashi, accusing Japan -- </p><p>wholly inaccurately -- of having a soft spot for the </p><p>LTTE.  End Note.) </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C/NF) As he was in our last meeting with him, </p><p>Akashi was highly articulate and well-briefed about the </p><p>Sri Lankan situation.  He underscored that Sri Lanka was </p><p>important to Japan as a way to show its foreign policy </p><p>to be "positive" and "activist."  All that said, it is </p><p>clear that Japan\'s exact role in the peace process still </p><p>needs further refinement in light of Norwegian </p><p>involvement and Indian sensitivities.  At one point in </p><p>the conversation, for example, Akashi used the past </p><p>tense in discussing Norway\'s role as peace facilitator, </p><p>almost as if Japan was waiting in the wings to take </p><p>over.  Our guess is that the GoN would not have been </p><p>happy to hear that.  Moreover, based on what we hear, </p><p>India is still not thrilled with the GoJ\'s emerging </p><p>role.  Japan needs to draw these threads together if it </p><p>wants its effort to be fully effective.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
