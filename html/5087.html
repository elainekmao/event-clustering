<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000082 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/CEN, DRL, AND IO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, LY, GT, UNCHR-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA CONSULTING INTERNALLY ON LIBYAN CHAIR OF </p><p>59TH CHR; SENDING NEW AMBASSADOR TO GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 5849 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador John Hamilton for reason 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p>Libya as Chair of UNCHR </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Embassy raised reftel points with the MFA Director for </p><p>Multilateral Affairs Sylvia Corado on January 9.  Corado </p><p>expressed her personal dismay with Libya chairing the UNCHR, </p><p>but said that the GOG had not decided how it would respond to </p><p>this unprecedented situation.  Corado noted that Foreign </p><p>Minister Gutierrez had only been in office ten days and had </p><p>not been able to focus much on multilateral issues due to </p><p>"growing problems in the bilateral relationship with the U.S. </p><p>and the EU."  Further complicating the matter is the fact </p><p>that Guatemala is currently without an Ambassador in Geneva </p><p>(see below).  Given the importance of the issue, Corado said </p><p>that Foreign Minister Gutierrez would want to formulate </p><p>Guatemala\'s position himself and that he would probably </p><p>consult President Portillo before making any final decisions. </p><p> She promised to apprise him of our concerns.  Although time </p><p>is short, Corado was confident that Gutierrez would formalize </p><p>Guatemala\'s position well in advance of the election in </p><p>Geneva on January 20. </p><p> </p><p>New Guatemalan Ambassador to Geneva </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  Foreign Minister Gutierrez has named Ronalth Ivan </p><p>OCHAETA Argueta, a personal friend who has served for the </p><p>last six months as Director of the OAS office in Lima, Peru, </p><p>as Guatemala\'s new Ambassador to Geneva.  According to the </p><p>Foreign Ministry,  Gutierrez made the decision to nominate </p><p>Ochaeta on January 7.  Ochaeta is expected to take up his </p><p>duties as early as mid-January.  Ochaeta\'s diplomatic career </p><p>began in March of 2000 when he was named Ambassador to the </p><p>OAS by President Portillo.  His connection to Gutierrez stems </p><p>from their work together as Human Rights leaders.  Ochaeta </p><p>and Gutierrez worked together on the REMHI report under the </p><p>Auspices of the Catholic Church.  Ochaeta worked for the </p><p>ArchBishop\'s Office for Human Rights (ODHA) for six years. </p><p>Ochaeta is a lawyer, 38 years old and married (NFI).  He </p><p>holds a Master\'s Degree in International Law.  We have not </p><p>heard why the GOG decided not to send Ambassador Rivera </p><p>(formerly the GOG Ambassador in Washington) to Geneva as </p><p>earlier announced. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
