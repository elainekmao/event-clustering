<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001454 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES SECURITY WITH INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson; reasons 1.5 b and </p><p>d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Interior Minister Aksu told Ambassador that </p><p>Americans in Turkey do not face a greater threat following </p><p>Parliament\'s failure to approve the stationing of U.S. </p><p>troops.  Aksu said the GOT will continue to provide 24-hour </p><p>security to the U.S. diplomatic community, and will maintain </p><p>order during anti-war protests.  Ambassador requested random </p><p>vehicle checks on a street abutting Embassy grounds; Aksu </p><p>said he will direct police to review the issue.  Ambassador </p><p>said the U.S. will continue to work closely with the GOT. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador thanked Interior Minister Aksu during a </p><p>March 6 meeting for the excellent security provided by police </p><p>to the entire American diplomatic community.  Ambassador said </p><p>he had met March 4 with Embassy spouses, who wanted to know </p><p>whether Parliament\'s March 1 vote failing to approve the </p><p>stationing of U.S. troops in Turkey has heightened security </p><p>risks for Americans.  Ambassador said he would like to hear </p><p>Aksu\'s views.  Aksu said he does not believe the </p><p>parliamentary vote will lead to an increased threat against </p><p>Americans.  The longstanding friendship between Turkey and </p><p>the U.S. will continue.  In Turkey, as in many countries, </p><p>there are staunchly anti-American groups, but they are </p><p>marginal and insignificant.  Some violent groups, </p><p>particularly KADEK (formerly PKK) are trying to manipulate </p><p>anti-war protests for their own ends.  The GOT will allow </p><p>people to express their views, but will maintain control, as </p><p>it did March 1 when police prevented demonstrators from </p><p>marching to the Parliament building.  The GOT will continue </p><p>to provide 24-hour security to the Embassy community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Aksu said the media and elements of the GOT are </p><p>distorting the Iraq issue, depicting the resolution on U.S. </p><p>troop deployment as a pro-U.S., pro-war measure.  In fact, </p><p>the resolution supports Turkey\'s interests.  Aksu said he </p><p>will continue to make this argument to Cabinet members and </p><p>parliamentarians.  Ambassador said he appreciated the </p><p>Government\'s courage in taking the controversial resolution </p><p>to a vote.  The U.S. remains a friend and ally of Turkey, and </p><p>will continue to work closely with the GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador said there is one gap in the otherwise </p><p>excellent security around the Embassy grounds -- the lack of </p><p>vehicle inspection on Paris Caddesi, which runs very close to </p><p>some Embassy facilities.  The GOT has installed a barrier on </p><p>Paris, but it is kept in the upright position and random </p><p>inspections are not being conducted.  The image of the unused </p><p>barrier could cause someone to think there is an opening that </p><p>could be exploited for an attack.  Random vehicle inspection </p><p>would have a critical deterrent effect.  Aksu said he will </p><p>direct the Ankara Police Chief to review the situation and </p><p>contact Embassy RSO.  The GOT will take the necessary </p><p>measures to protect the Embassy.  Ambassador thanked Aksu and </p><p>said he might have to seek increased GOT security assistance </p><p>in the event of war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
