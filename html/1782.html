<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001461 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/26/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ETHNIC CLASHES IN NASARAWA STATE CONTINUE </p><p>SPORADICALLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1448 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary.  Ethnic clashes in the Middle-Belt State of </p><p>Nasarawa continue sporadically.  Frightened citizens have </p><p>fled the areas of conflict in the southeastern corner of the </p><p>state, but the numbers are uncertain, and press reports may </p><p>be inflated.  Isolated fighting in the village of </p><p>Tudun-Adegbo cost approximately 25 lives the evening of June </p><p>25.  International Red Cross officials have sent a mission to </p><p>assess the situation and expect to have better information </p><p>within a day or two.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Local press reports continue of clashes between rival </p><p>ethnic groups in the southeast corner of Nasarawa State, a </p><p>Middle-Belt State located immediately to the east of the </p><p>Federal Capital Territory.  Poloff spoke with Nasarawa </p><p>Governor Abdullahi Adamu June 25 by telephone and received an </p><p>update on the conflict.  Adamu said that the uneasy peace </p><p>established over the previous week-end had been broken by </p><p>fighting the night of June 25 in the village of Tudun-Adegbo. </p><p> Approximately 45 persons were admitted to local hospitals </p><p>with injuries, and there were six confirmed deaths.  He </p><p>estimated the total loss of life from the fighting at 25. </p><p>Governor Adamu said that he had requested reinforcements from </p><p>the national police and expected their arrival shortly.  Also </p><p>reached by telephone June 26, the Deputy Commissioner of </p><p>Police for Federal Operations confirmed the dispatch of three </p><p>additional mobile police units to Nasarawa (approximately 60 </p><p>men). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Governor Adamu dismissed accounts of fighting in the </p><p>State capital of Lafia, saying that the arrival of injured </p><p>persons and "a few bodies" had caused "some disturbances," </p><p>but that police on the scene had prevented any serious </p><p>altercation.  The conflict was confined entirely to two Local </p><p>Government Areas (LGAs) of the southeast, he said. (Note: </p><p>Nasarawa has 13 LGAs in total. End Note).   Governor Adamu </p><p>said he did not know the numbers of people who had fled their </p><p>homes in the troubled areas, but that certainly there had </p><p>been "many people leaving," particularly ethnic Tivs heading </p><p>south to Benue State (where Tivs are a majority).  He also </p><p>said he had met with the Benue State Governor, George Akume </p><p>to discuss the situation and work on "ways to lessen the </p><p>tension." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Poloff also spoke by telephone June 26 with the </p><p>Director of the International Red Cross in Nigeria, </p><p>Jean-Jacque Gacond, who said he had dispatched a Red Cross </p><p>team to Makurdi, capital of Benue State, to assess the </p><p>situation.  Gacond said he thought that perhaps "some </p><p>thousands" had fled their homes, but he had no hard figures. </p><p>He discounted one press report of 35,000 displaced persons </p><p>fleeing into makeshift camps in Benue State, saying the </p><p>report was probably inflated.  Gacond said he expected to </p><p>have better information by June 27 or 28. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment.  Renewed fighting, even in isolated areas, </p><p>obviously makes efforts by local officials at reconciliation </p><p>(reftel) that much harder.  We hope to have better </p><p>information soon on the numbers of displaced persons and </p><p>their present location.  End comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
