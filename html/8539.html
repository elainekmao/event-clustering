Ugur Ziyal will pay a three-day visit to the U.S. </p><p>beginning June 15, papers report.  The Turkish delegation </p><p>will try to convince the American side that Turkey\'s </p><p>democratic structure and close ties with regional ethnic </p><p>groups can influence developments positively in Iraq. Ziyal </p><p>will also make clear that Ankara is willing to repair </p><p>misunderstandings resulting from the Iraq crisis.  Ankara </p><p>also plans to confirm that it will recognize a Kurdish </p><p>administration set up in Baghdad, and is ready to support a </p><p>structure which reflects the common interests of all Iraqi </p><p>groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. `cornering\' Iran: Dailies report that the Pentagon, in </p><p>an effort to use the Iranian opposition group `People\'s </p><p>Mujehadin\' against Tehran, is trying to convince the White </p><p>House to change the status of the organization, which is </p><p>currently on the U.S. list of terrorist groups.  Assistant </p><p>Secretary of State John Bolton accused Iran of trying to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>acquire nuclear weapons, and noted that Turkey is within the </p><p>range of Iranian and Syrian missiles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Amb. Pearson plants tree on World Environment Day: </p><p>Ambassador Robert Pearson planted a tree at a high school in </p><p>Ankara on World Environment Day, papers report. Ambassador </p><p>Pearson said after planting a Storax tree, a rare species </p><p>seen only in California and southwest Turkey, that the tree </p><p>could be seen as a symbol of close ties between the U.S. and </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>European Parliament approves Turkey report: The European </p><p>Parliament (EP) approved on Thursday a report on Turkey </p><p>drafted by the Dutch Christian Democrat Arie Oostlander. </p><p>The report said that if reforms are enacted, Turkey would </p><p>become eligible for full EU membership talks.  The report </p><p>notes that the military\'s influence has slowed Turkey\'s </p><p>development into a pluralistic democracy, and urged that </p><p>military representatives be withdrawn from civilian bodies </p><p>concerned with education and the media.  The report called </p><p>for the release of jailed former pro-Kurdish Democracy Party </p><p>(DEP) parliamentarians, and for more efficient measures to </p><p>be taken against torture.  It urged changes to the Law on </p><p>the Struggle Against Terrorism and a more determined effort </p><p>to fight against corruption.  The EP called on Turkey to end </p><p>discrimination against religious minorities, to take bold </p><p>steps to achieve a workable solution to the Cyprus problem, </p><p>and to develop good neighborly relations with Armenia.  Most </p><p>mainstream papers evaluate the report as giving a `green </p><p>light\' to Turkey\'s EU drive.  "Milliyet" and "Cumhuriyet" </p><p>interpret the report as a signal that Turkey is not ready </p><p>for the EU due to the military\'s role in politics and the </p><p>deadlock on Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey, Armenia warming ties: Turkish foreign minister Gul </p><p>and Armenian foreign minister Oskanyan agreed on some moves </p><p>toward a rapprochement at the NATO summit in Madrid earlier </p><p>this week.  Dailies expect border trade to begin among </p><p>Turkey, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, a move that could boost the </p><p>welfare and security of people in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Post-war US policies/Middle East </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US and the Middle East" </p><p>Kamuran Ozbir wrote in nationalist Ortadogu (6/6): "The </p><p>psychological atmosphere in the Middle East changed </p><p>dramatically after the Iraq war and following Secretary </p><p>Powell\'s meeting with the leaders of Syria and Lebanon.  The </p><p>US is determined to change the regional equilibrium and to </p><p>implement its policies. . US policies for the Middle East </p><p>are a challenge to the Syrian and Lebanese administrations, </p><p>because they will be forced to decide between the demands of </p><p>their people and the insistence of the US to act in favor of </p><p>privileges for Israel.  Syria cannot afford to ignore the US </p><p>demands, especially after America has become, in effect, the </p><p>immediate neighbor of the Damascus regime. . It remains to </p><p>be seen to what extent the Middle East regimes will be able </p><p>to cooperate with US demands in the region.  Yet the fact of </p><p>the matter is that the US retains a very privileged status </p><p>in the region due to the fall of Saddam\'s regime like a </p><p>house of cards." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bush\'s footsteps" </p><p>Erdal Guven opined in the liberal-intellectual Radikal </p><p>(6/6): "President Bush\'s tour, which began in Poland and </p><p>ended in Qatar, is giving some clues for the new Europe as </p><p>well as the new Middle East. . In the coming years, US- </p><p>Polish relations will progress further, and Poland is about </p><p>to become a `second United Kingdom\' in the eyes of </p><p>Washington.  Warsaw-Washington relations seem to be very </p><p>much like the special bonds between the US and the UK, which </p><p>were established after WWII.  This is the first lesson to be </p><p>taken from the seven-day tour by President Bush.  The fact </p><p>that one of Iraq\'s three regions has been placed under </p><p>Polish control is a concrete indication that these special </p><p>bonds have already been formed." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
