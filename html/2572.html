EXCERPTS FOLLOW: </p><p> </p><p>"THE FAILURE BY BOTH THE REGISTRAR GENERAL\'S OFFICE </p><p>AND THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION (ESC) TO </p><p>ADVISE VOTERS PROPERLY ON THEIR RESPECTIVE WARDS AND </p><p>POLLING STATIONS IS ONE OF MANY ATTEMPTS TO CONFUSE </p><p>THE ELECTORATE AND PREDETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THIS </p><p>WEEKEND\'S MAYORAL, MUNICIPAL AND PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS.
