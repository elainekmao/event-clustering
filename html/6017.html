<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000366 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/SA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC - NEWCOMB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PINS, BEXP, ASEC, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS DENY COCA-COLA EXTORTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 0352 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On February 28 Narayan Singh Pun, Minister for </p><p>Physical Works and government-appointed interlocutor with </p><p>Maoist insurgents, called the Ambassador to report that he </p><p>had, as requested, raised with his Maoist contacts the </p><p>continued extortion of funds from Coca-Cola\'s local </p><p>representative (Reftel).  (Note:  As requested by Coca-Cola </p><p>and the Ambassador, Pun did not mention the company by name </p><p>in his discussion.  End note.)  His Maoist interlocutors </p><p>vigorously denied that their leadership has either sanctioned </p><p>or encouraged such activities since the January 29 ceasefire, </p><p>Pun told the Ambassador.  The Maoists suggested that the </p><p>extortion may have been carried out by imposters, and claimed </p><p>that bogus "humanitarian organizations" pressing for </p><p>"donations" from the international community to support the </p><p>peace process had succeeded in raising as much as USD 1 </p><p>million.  When told that the extortion demand had been </p><p>accompanied by a signed letter from Maoist leader Prachanda </p><p>that appeared authentic, Pun\'s interlocutors asked for a copy </p><p>of the letter, as well as the name of the person who had </p><p>demanded the money, and assured him that appropriate action </p><p>would be taken against any errant cadre violating the </p><p>directive against extortion.  Pun told the Ambassador he </p><p>would pass a copy of the extortion letter, as well as any </p><p>additional information, to his Maoist contacts, if desired. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Poloff advised Coca-Cola Country Manager N.N. Singh </p><p>of Pun\'s offer and asked for permission to pass a copy of the </p><p>extortion letter received by Coca-Cola, with the company\'s </p><p>name and any other identifying information excised from the </p><p>text.  Poloff also asked if she could pass on the name </p><p>(assumed to be a nom de guerre) of the extortionist.  Singh </p><p>expressed concern that even passing on the Maoist alias could </p><p>be dangerous, citing Maoist killings of alleged "informants," </p><p>including two U.S. Embassy guards, as examples.  After </p><p>discussing the matter with Coca-Cola\'s regional office in </p><p>Bangkok, Singh told poloff that the company did not want to </p><p>release a copy of the letter--even without identifying </p><p>information--or the name of the extortionist to the Maoists. </p><p>Poloff agreed not to supply the information.  Singh said he </p><p>would attempt to parry any future demands for funds by saying </p><p>he had not received authorization to pay from Coca-Cola </p><p>corporate headquarters. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Comment:  Singh\'s reaction indicates just how </p><p>successful the Maoists have been in intimidating the local </p><p>population.  Even members of the well-connected business </p><p>elite like the Country Manager for the largest multinational </p><p>firm in Nepal are too fearful to take action against </p><p>low-ranking Maoist couriers--ceasefire or no ceasefire.  We </p><p>will continue to explore, along with other embassies and </p><p>their respective bilateral business chambers, the issuing of </p><p>a joint public statement condemning the continued extortion. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
