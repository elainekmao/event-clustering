<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000440 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS TO TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, BEXP, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: SLOW GOING AT THE MINISTRY OF AVIATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFED; PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by Econoff </p><p>and USTDA representatives Steingass and Hardy, met with </p><p>Minister of Aviation Chikwe in late January.  Despite </p><p>Nigerian participation at a November 2002 Air Cargo </p><p>Roundtable in Washington, the Minister showed little </p><p>interest in expanding air cargo links between the U.S. and </p><p>Nigeria.  Chikwe lauded her accomplishments since 2000, but </p><p>blamed Nigeria\'s press and the Bureau of Public Enterprise </p><p>(BPE) for sabotaging her deal to reorganize Nigeria </p><p>Airways.  The Minister said President Obasanjo wanted to </p><p>maintain a national carrier, and supported her ongoing </p><p>efforts to do so.  Chikwe said she had done all she could </p><p>to obtain Category I status for Nigeria, but the National </p><p>Assembly had yet to pass necessary legislation. Steingass </p><p>informed Chikwe that USTDA will likely provide funding to </p><p>DynCorp, a U.S. Corporation, for a feasibility study for </p><p>the construction of a $400 million National Aircraft </p><p>Maintenance Center in Lagos. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In late January, Ambassador Jeter, Econoff, and </p><p>USTDA representatives Steingass and Hardy (who were </p><p>visiting Abuja on an assessment visit) met with Minister of </p><p>Aviation Kema Chikwe. The Minister thanked USTDA for its </p><p>support and stated that the U.S. had "done much" in the </p><p>last three years to assist Nigeria\'s aviation sector. </p><p>Steingass thanked the Minister for sending representatives </p><p>to a late-2002 USTDA/DOT/ExIm-sponsored African Air Cargo </p><p>Transportation Roundtable in Washington. The conference, he </p><p>noted, had brought private sector air cargo specialists and </p><p>U.S. and African officials together to discuss expanding </p><p>links in air cargo service between the U.S. and Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ExIm Director Joseph Grandmaison had written to </p><p>the Ambassador in December 2002 to ask what the GON planned </p><p>to do to improve Nigeria\'s air cargo connections and had </p><p>met with the Minister and her staff during subsequent </p><p>visits.  During the Ambassador\'s follow-up meeting with the </p><p>Minister, and during a separate meeting between Econoff and </p><p>Chief I.E. Awodu, the Technical Assistant to the Minister, </p><p>our Nigerian interlocutors admitted that they had given </p><p>little attention to expanding air cargo links with the </p><p>United States.  They argued that without a viable national </p><p>carrier, Nigeria would have difficulty benefiting from </p><p>increased air cargo connections. (Comment: The argument is </p><p>specious in that one private carrier in Nigeria, and </p><p>possibly more, might be capable of ensuring air cargo </p><p>service between the two countries.  The carrier providing </p><p>such a service need not be state controlled.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Accomplishments </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) During the late January meeting, Minister Chikwe </p><p>listed her accomplishments since assuming office in 2000: </p><p>constructing Abuja\'s diplomatic hangar, developing gardens </p><p>and planting hedges at the nation\'s airports, banning </p><p>antiquated aircraft, making the airports more secure, </p><p>refurbishing runways, repairing some radar systems, </p><p>renewing the Zaria pilot training school, and purchasing </p><p>passenger buses to shuttle passengers between aircraft and </p><p>terminals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>"Nigeria Airways Should Have Been Closed 10 Years Ago" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) After giving herself credit and noting that </p><p>President Obasanjo supported her, Chikwe lambasted </p><p>Nigeria\'s Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE), especially its </p><p>Director General Nasir El-Rufai. She accused BPE of </p><p>sabotaging her efforts at reorganizing Nigeria Airways into </p><p>the newly named Air Nigeria. The Minister said she had </p><p>wanted to broker a deal with the U.K.-based Air Wing, then </p><p>approach Singapore Airlines to partner with the GON in </p><p>lucrative routes to the U.S. and U.K. BPE was not the only </p><p>party that opposed the idea.  Chikwe chided the Nigerian </p><p>press for writing erroneous reports about it, stating "it </p><p>was just blackmail."  She then berated Nigeria Airways </p><p>management for leasing airplanes for its international </p><p>routes, without having the cash to pay the lessors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: In mid-2002, the Ministry of Aviation </p><p>planned to establish a joint venture with Airwing </p><p>Aerospace, a heretofore unknown U.K. company, which was to </p><p>have bought 49% of state-owned Nigeria Airways.  BPE had no </p><p>prior knowledge of the arrangement.  El-Rufai blocked the </p><p>deal in late September 2002 because, as he stated publicly, </p><p>the arrangement lacked transparency and was really a "give- </p><p>away" of the national carrier.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Obasanjo Wants a National Carrier </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Minister Chikwe asserted that the Ministry was not </p><p>in a position to shut down the national carrier no matter </p><p>the name since President Obasanjo wanted a national </p><p>airline. Moreover, the BPE can not privatize a bankrupt </p><p>airline with 2,000 employees on the payroll, she said. </p><p>Since the airline should have been closed 10 years ago, she </p><p>recommended to the President that the GON not invest a </p><p>single dollar in Nigeria Airways; the GON should try </p><p>instead to establish a joint venture with credible </p><p>management to ply international routes. (Comment: Why the </p><p>agony should be prolonged remains an open question. The GON </p><p>continues to invest billions of Naira in unprofitable state </p><p>enterprises, such as Nigeria Airways.  Since its </p><p>establishment, Nigeria Airways planes have often flown </p><p>half-full with many non-paying customers.  Still, many GON </p><p>officials including the President believe that a national </p><p>carrier is essential to Nigeria\'s national prestige and </p><p>identity, and may one day be profitable.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Problems and More Problems </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Minister claimed that all levels of Nigeria\'s </p><p>aviation sector need assistance. She said the Ministry </p><p>received many reports from passengers of lost or stolen </p><p>items from personal luggage and cargo shipments at </p><p>Nigeria\'s airports.  With respect to personnel, she said </p><p>the youngest Nigeria-trained pilot was 40 years old.  The </p><p>National Aviation Training Center in Zaria had not trained </p><p>a single pilot in 10 years, she said. The Ambassador asked </p><p>whether the GON trains pilots abroad.  The Minister replied </p><p>that doing so was too costly. She noted that between 1979 </p><p>when Obasanjo gave up power and 1999 when he resumed as </p><p>Head of State, military rulers had not maintained the </p><p>aviation sector. This neglect accounts for the poor </p><p>condition of many of Nigeria\'s regional airports.  Chikwe </p><p>asked whether USTDA could help train Nigeria\'s pilots and </p><p>upgrade its radar systems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Steingass told the Minister that USTDA does not </p><p>provide direct assistance to countries, but provides </p><p>funding for feasibility studies and training related to US- </p><p>based company investments in Nigeria. Chikwe responded that </p><p>she would form a small committee to maintain contact with </p><p>USTDA and to brainstorm about areas where USTDA could </p><p>assist the Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Category I </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) The Ambassador requested an update on Nigeria\'s </p><p>progress toward Category I status. Minister Chikwe said she </p><p>had done all she could toward that end.  The National </p><p>Assembly must pass the legislation, though nothing will </p><p>likely happen until after the April presidential election. </p><p>(Comment: Nigeria has not met International Civil Aviation </p><p>Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards and </p><p>cannot fly to the United States utilizing its own crews and </p><p>aircraft.  The GON has failed to implement an ICAO </p><p>recommendation that the Director General of the Nigerian </p><p>Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) be given autonomous </p><p>decision-making authority with respect to aviation safety </p><p>and ancillary regulatory responsibilities. The National </p><p>Assembly is considering legislation that would grant the </p><p>NCAA such autonomy.  But pending legislative action, the </p><p>NCAA remains under the authority of the Minister of </p><p>Aviation.  Even if the legislation were passed, Nigeria </p><p>would fall short of Category I status.  Nigeria lacks </p><p>internationally trained cabin crews and operations </p><p>inspectors, and has no operational aircraft.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>National Aircraft Maintenance Facility </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The Ambassador concluded the meeting by noting </p><p>the huge potential in Nigeria\'s aviation sector.  Steingass </p><p>added that USTDA had financed a feasibility study of a </p><p>Lagos-based National Aircraft Maintenance Facility in 1990, </p><p>but owing to changes in Nigerian governments, the facility </p><p>was never realized. He added that USTDA is considering </p><p>funding part of a feasibility study by Texas-based DynCorp. </p><p>(At a projected cost of $400 million, the National Aircraft </p><p>Maintenance Center would be the largest in Africa.  Post </p><p>will report relevant developments, via septel.) </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
