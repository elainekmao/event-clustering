(C)  FOR THE ELECTIONS OF MARCH, 1992, THE </p><p>SOCIALIST PARTY WAS PREPARED TO FACE A MAJOR </p><p>DEFEAT.

(C)  IN 1996, THERE WERE RUMORS HIS DAUGHTER </p><p>WAS TAKING DRUGS WHILE HE WAS IN PRISON AND THAT </p><p>HIS TEENAGE SON HAD GOTTEN OUT OF HIS MOTHER\'S </p><p>CONTROL, BECOMING REBELLIOUS AND UNRULY.  WITH </p><p>BOTH OF HIS CHILDREN CURRENTLY STUDYING OUTSIDE OF </p><p>ALBANIA, WHATEVER THE TRUTH OF THE RUMORS, THEY </p><p>SEEM TO BE DOING WELL NOW AND RECENTLY JOINED </p><p>THEIR PARENTS AT A DAY A DURRES BEACH WHERE </p><p>FOREIGNERS WERE PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  NANO IS AN INTENSE, FOCUSSED INDIVIDUAL </p><p>WHO, AT ABOUT 5\' 6" IS AVERAGE HEIGHT FOR AN </p><p>ALBANIAN MALE.  FORMERLY SLIM AND CLEANSHAVEN, HE </p><p>EMERGED FROM PRISON WITH A SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT GAIN </p><p>AND A BEARD.  MANY OLD ACQUAINTANCES SAID THEY DID </p><p>NOT RECOGNIZE HIM AFTER HIS RELEASE.  A HEAVY </p><p>SMOKER, A SOCIAL ANIMAL WHO ENJOYS LATE-NIGHT </p><p>SCHMOOZING WITH HIS INNER CIRCLE OF POLITICAL </p><p>FRIENDS, NANO IS SERIOUS EVEN WHEN HE IS JOKING. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  HIS CLOSEST FRIEND WHO STUCK WITH HIM </p><p>THROUGH THE WORST TIMES, WHEN HE WAS IN PRISON, IS </p><p>BASHKIM ZENELI.  ZENELI, WHO BESIDES NANO\'S WIFE </p><p>HAS BEEN HIS MOST INTIMATE CONFIDANT, HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>GIVEN A PRESTIGIOUS HIGH-PROFILE POSITION. </p><p>RATHER, AS MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT AND DEPUTY HEAD OF </p><p>THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, </p><p>HE KEEPS A FAIRLY LOW PROFILE. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C)  NANO\'S WIFE VISITED HIM ONCE A WEEK IN </p><p>TEPELENA PRISON.  THEY ARE VERY EVIDENTLY DEVOTED </p><p>TO ONE ANOTHER AND WHILE SHE IS NOT AS PROFICIENT </p><p>IN LANGUAGES AND DOES NOT SPEAK MUCH WHEN THEY ARE </p><p>IN PUBLIC OR IN THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGNERS, IT </p><p>SEEMS CLEAR THAT NANO HOLDS HER OPINION IN HIGH </p><p>REGARD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LINO </p><p></p></div>
