<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 NASSAU 000722 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, BF, SNAR, Bahamian Politics </p><p>SUBJECT: HUBERT INGRAHAM A YEAR LATER - NO EXCUSES, NO </p><p>APOLOGIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL/ECON Section Chief Brian Bachman, Reasons 1.5(b) and </p><p> (d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p> ------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) POL/ECON section chief met with former Prime Minister </p><p>Hubert Ingraham on April 8 for a wide-ranging discussion of </p><p>his tenure in office and current Bahamian politics.  Ingraham </p><p>freely gave his opinions about current political developments </p><p>such as the upcoming Free National Movement (FNM) convention </p><p>(thinks Tommy Turnquest will not be seriously challenged </p><p>until next convention), Perry Christie\'s management style and </p><p>character (says he\'s always been indecisive and lacks vision, </p><p>but is a good man), Christie\'s Cabinet (thinks they are a </p><p>collection of ambitious incompetents), the Progressive </p><p>Liberal Party (PLP) government\'s legislative agenda </p><p>(non-existent), and bilateral relations (hopes Embassy and </p><p>Christie government can improve cooperation).  He also </p><p>vigorously defended his record during his ten years in </p><p>office, claiming to have no regrets.  Ingraham said he was </p><p>unsurprised that the FNM lost last May, but only reluctantly </p><p>agreed that he might share some of the blame for that loss. </p><p>He said he was fully confident of his continued popularity </p><p>and consistently dodged questions about his own political </p><p>future.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Out to Pasture? </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POL/ECON chief called on Ingraham at his Cable Beach </p><p>office, which was relatively small but nicely appointed. </p><p>Ingraham works there alone, with just a single employee, a </p><p>part-time receptionist who left before the meeting concluded. </p><p> He did not seem to be terribly busy, as the phone only rang </p><p>twice during an hour and half long conversation, and neither </p><p>call seemed work-related.  His desk was near empty and his TV </p><p>was on and tuned to CNN to watch war news.  Ingraham freely </p><p>admitted that he was not very active in Parliament and didn\'t </p><p>anticipate that he would become more active any time soon. </p><p>He said he still considers himself an FNM, and will vote with </p><p>the FNM block, but is taking no role in ongoing party </p><p>politics.  When asked if he would complete his term or retire </p><p>completely from politics, Ingraham said he hadn\'t given it </p><p>much thought. </p><p> </p><p>Perry and Hubert </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ingraham quickly warmed to the political discussion </p><p>however, and his love for the game sparkled in his eyes as we </p><p>covered a broad range of topics.  He told POL/ECON chief that </p><p>he and Perry Christie remained good friends and said they </p><p>talked by phone a couple of times a week.  Ingraham said that </p><p>they didn\'t always talk politics, but didn\'t avoid the topic </p><p>either, and said that he offered advice to Christie </p><p>regularly.  He said that he believes Christie is a good man, </p><p>and well-intentioned, but criticized his leadership style. </p><p>Ingraham said "Perry has always been indecisive, and will </p><p>always be indecisive.  It\'s just the way he is.  He can\'t </p><p>change."  He also alleged that Christie had no real vision </p><p>other than a general desire to improve social programs, and </p><p>nothing he really wanted to accomplish.  Ingraham contrasted </p><p>Christie with himself, saying he had come in with a definite </p><p>agenda and moved decisively to accomplish it, whereas </p><p>Christie "enjoys being Prime Minister" but doesn\'t really </p><p>feel any urgency to get things done.  Ingraham also said that </p><p>Christie is, however, head and shoulders above anyone else in </p><p>the PLP, and their only real option as leader.  He is the </p><p>only one with broad enough appeal to bring in swing voters, </p><p>largely because he, unlike many other PLP politicians, is </p><p>viewed as "trustworthy" and "solid".  Even FNMs Ingraham </p><p>said, don\'t fear for the country with Christie in charge, as </p><p>he is unlikely to do anything rash.  Combined with the fact </p><p>that he loves the job, Ingraham sees Christie as firmly </p><p>implanted in the PLP leadership and consequently, the PM\'s </p><p>office.  "It would take dynamite to get him out of that </p><p>seat", said Ingraham, when asked if he thought Christie would </p><p>run for another term. </p><p> </p><p>A Sorry Bunch </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Despite his generally complimentary words about </p><p>Christie, Ingraham had nothing good to say about the rest of </p><p>his government.  He gleefully discussed at length PLP </p><p>missteps since coming into office, highlighting most of all </p><p>the fact that they "have no legislative agenda."  Ingraham </p><p>pointed out that the PLP Parliament has passed almost no </p><p>legislation that hadn\'t been initially proposed by his </p><p>government, and doesn\'t seem to be working on anything now. </p><p>He also comprehensively criticized the PLP Cabinet, saying </p><p>"Once you get past Perry, what have you got?"  Ingraham said </p><p>that the Christie Cabinet was inexperienced, incompetent and </p><p>politically unschooled.  He also said many of them harbor </p><p>further political ambitions and have their own agendas, and </p><p>shook his head at Christie\'s seeming inability to control </p><p>them.  Ingraham said he "never would have tolerated such </p><p>behavior" in his own Cabinet.  He sympathized with Christie, </p><p>however, noting how, under the Westminster system, it is </p><p>difficult to just remove a Cabinet Minister or discipline him </p><p>effectively, as all it may do is create a political enemy who </p><p>retains his seat in Parliament.  Ingraham acknowledged that </p><p>this had never stopped him, but claimed, with a mischievous </p><p>gleam in his eye, that that was "because I was always </p><p>confident -- confident that I had the support of the people. </p><p>Perry doesn\'t have that confidence."  In fact, Ingraham said </p><p>he believed the PLP had squandered its mandate almost </p><p>immediately and no longer enjoyed the support of the people, </p><p>because of its inaction and political stumbles.  One </p><p>political blunder he highlighted was the PLP\' apparent </p><p>hostility toward the civil service, whom they believe to be </p><p>in bed with the FNM after ten years of FNM rule.  Ingraham </p><p>said "They don\'t even realize that the public service </p><p>overwhelmingly voted for them (the PLP) in the election, and </p><p>now they\'re alienating this key block of swing voters." </p><p> </p><p>FNM Needs Unity </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Ingraham acknowledged that just because the PLP was </p><p>losing support didn\'t mean that people were ready to turn </p><p>back to the FNM.  He said that the FNM had a lot of work to </p><p>do before it would be competitive politically again.  What </p><p>was most needed, he said, was unity.  According to Ingraham, </p><p>many of the FNM\'s wounds were self-inflicted, and he had </p><p>harsh criticism for former ministers Algernon Allen and </p><p>Tennyson Wells, who attacked the leadership process that saw </p><p>them unsuccessfully challenge Tommy Turnquest, Ingraham\'s </p><p>hand-picked successor and then complain bitterly in public </p><p>about Ingraham\'s stacking the deck.  Ingraham vehemently (but </p><p>unconvincingly) denied influencing the leadership process, </p><p>and defended Turnquest as "the best man for the job at the </p><p>time."  He did criticize Turnquest\'s decision to accept a </p><p>celebratory party financed by a contractor doing business </p><p>with his Ministry, saying it gave the PLP and Allen and Wells </p><p>a convenient target.  Ingraham said it was an "unfortunate </p><p>decision", because until then no one could say Tommy wasn\'t </p><p>honest."  He thought it was very damaging to Tommy\'s chances </p><p>in the election. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Nonetheless, Ingraham predicted that Tommy would </p><p>survive any leadership challenge in the upcoming May FNM </p><p>convention.  In fact, he predicted that no serious challenge </p><p>would emerge at this convention.  According to Ingraham, </p><p>those most likely to challenge Tommy Turnquest would lie low </p><p>at this convention, since they don\'t really have any desire </p><p>to be the leader of an opposition party for the next four </p><p>years, and would bring out their serious challenge at the </p><p>next convention, which he predicted would be in another 18 </p><p>months, by which time the next election would already be in </p><p>sight on the horizon.  Ingraham quickly and confidently </p><p>rattled off who he believed the new FNM leadership team would </p><p>be after the election: Turnquest as leader, former Minister </p><p>of Industry and Development Zhivargo Laing as deputy leader, </p><p>former Attorney General Carl Bethel as party chairman, and </p><p>former legislators Johnley Ferguson and Darrin Cash to round </p><p>out the leadership slate, a group he characterized as "young, </p><p>energetic and talented."  With respect to Brent Symonette, </p><p>who has publicly ruminated about challenging for the </p><p>leadership, Ingraham dismissed his chances, but denied that </p><p>Symonette\'s race (he is white) had anything to do with it. </p><p>Rather, Ingraham said it was his personality and lack of </p><p>appeal outside the bounds of his wealthy constituency.  In </p><p>fact, he said the best thing that could happen would be for </p><p>Symonette to challenge for the leadership, because he "would </p><p>be beaten so soundly that it would shatter all his </p><p>illusions."  Ingraham confidently predicted that the FNM </p><p>would win the next election, saying Christie\'s PLP "already </p><p>had the markings of a one term government." </p><p> </p><p>No Mistakes </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) When asked if he had any regrets from his ten years </p><p>in office, or if he would do anything differently if given </p><p>the opportunity, Ingraham quickly responded "Absolutely not!" </p><p> He said he was a contented man, and that he had accomplished </p><p>virtually everything he set out to do.  On further </p><p>reflection, he admitted that he wished that the FNM </p><p>leadership transition had been handled better, but he </p><p>deflected blame for that, saying that it should have been </p><p>done earlier and smoother, but he was delayed by FNMs who </p><p>kept urging him to put it off and trying to get him to run </p><p>again.  With regard to the failed constitutional referendum, </p><p>which many point to as a key factor in the FNM\'s electoral </p><p>loss, Ingraham denied that it was a factor.  In fact, he </p><p>said, he had already become convinced by January of 2002 that </p><p>the FNM would lose the general election, and scheduled the </p><p>referendum because he was confident that it would pass and </p><p>would give the FNM momentum going into the election.  He </p><p>admitted to being shocked when the PLP came out against the </p><p>referendum, since they had all voted for the various </p><p>amendments in Parliament, but refused to characterize it as a </p><p>political miscalculation. Ingraham showed a glint of anger at </p><p>the suggestion that some in the FNM blamed him for the </p><p>electoral loss, and fired back.  He strongly defended his </p><p>record and claimed that he was still the FNM\'s most popular </p><p>politician.  He pointed out that he had won in 1992 and 1997 </p><p>by strong margins, and that it was only after he left the </p><p>leadership that the FNM lost.  According to Ingraham, the FNM </p><p>asked him to step away from the campaign not because he was </p><p>unpopular, but because his popularity left Turnquest in his </p><p>shadow.  Finally he did grudgingly admit that he might have </p><p>to share some of the blame for the FNM loss. "I guess if I </p><p>take credit for the victories I also have to take credit for </p><p>the losses," Ingraham said, but added with fire in his voice, </p><p>"And no one can deny that I was responsible for the victories </p><p>in 1992 and 1997!" </p><p> </p><p>Bilateral Relations </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Ingraham also raised his concern with publicly </p><p>reported spats between the Embassy and the PLP government. </p><p>He offered no criticism of the Embassy, but said "I hope </p><p>things are patched up and calm down.  We need a strong </p><p>bilateral relationship."  He offered some mild criticism of </p><p>the GOCB\'s handling of the bilateral relationship.  In </p><p>particular, he obliquely criticized Christie by saying that </p><p>under his government, ministers would not have been given as </p><p>much leeway.  He also said he believed Foreign Minister </p><p>Mitchell could have handled the controversy over the </p><p>Ambassador\'s remarks at the Joint Task Force meeting in </p><p>December better, and chalked it up to "inexperience and </p><p>pride."  Ingraham acknowledged, that with the exception of </p><p>what he termed  "the Defense Force allegations", none of the </p><p>issues raised by the Ambassador were new or should have been </p><p>a surprise.  In particular, he ruefully admitted that his own </p><p>government had failed to fulfill its promise of several years </p><p>to create a national drug control strategy, but said that it </p><p>was his understanding that it had been "nearly done" when he </p><p>left office. </p><p> </p><p>Cagey About the Future </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) When asked about his own political future, Ingraham, </p><p>dodged artfully.  He said that he had only run for MP this </p><p>last election at the urging of the party, and considers </p><p>himself retired.  Ingraham claimed that he had no intention </p><p>of defending his seat in 2007, and does not intend to take an </p><p>active role in the upcoming FNM convention.  When asked </p><p>directly if he would ever consider reentering politics, </p><p>Ingraham dodged the question completely.  He did admit that </p><p>various people within the FNM continued to push him to retake </p><p>the leadership, however, and refused several clear </p><p>opportunities to say he was definitely not interested. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Supremely self-confident, unapologetic and, dare we </p><p>say, arrogant as ever, Ingraham still has a forceful and </p><p>formidable presence.  Currently inactive in Parliament and </p><p>largely out of the public view, he obviously is still keeping </p><p>a close eye on political events both inside and outside the </p><p>party, and we have little doubt that he still has influence </p><p>within the FNM if he chooses to use it.  Ingraham is still a </p><p>relatively young man for a politician, and seems to have </p><p>little desire to return to his former trade (the law).  If </p><p>the Christie government continues to struggle against a weak </p><p>economy and the widespread perception that it is inactive, </p><p>and Bahamian voters begin to feel a little nostalgia for the </p><p>strong hand on the tiller, we wouldn\'t be surprised if Hubert </p><p>Ingraham reemerges as a potential "savior" for his party and </p><p>The Bahamas.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BLANKENSHIP </p><p></p></div>
