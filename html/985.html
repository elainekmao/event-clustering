<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 000239 </p><p> </p><p>NICOSIA FOR ILMG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/12/09 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, ECON, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  BASHAR CONTACT SAYS ASAD\'S SON HAS "INDEPENDENT" </p><p>          INFLUENCE OVER ARMY; ADMITS REGIME IGNORANT </p><p>          ON ECONOMIC ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) DAMASCUS IIR 6 891 0060 99 (B) 98 DAMASCUS 7639 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RYAN C. CROCKER.  REASON 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>BASHAR KNOCKING HEADS IN THE MILITARY </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  ONE OF OUR CONTACTS WHO SEEMINGLY HAS OPEN CHANNELS </p><p>OF COMMUNICATION TO PRESIDENTIAL SON BASHAR AL-ASAD (AND AN </p><p>APPARENT AGENDA TO HIGHLIGHT THE REALITIES OF HIS </p><p>ASCENDANCE), PROVIDED NEW EVIDENCE OF HIS MENTOR\'S </p><p>CREDENTIALS ON JANUARY 11. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE CASE OF BASHIR NAJJAR, FORMER GID CHIEF WHO WAS </p><p>DISMISSED LAST JULY, HAS BEEN REFERRED TO COURT FOR </p><p>PROSECUTION, APPARENTLY FOR CORRUPTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- SMI IS SLOWLY BUT THOROUGHLY BEING CLEANSED OF SMI CHIEF </p><p>`ALI DUBA\'S MEN, WHO ARE PEPPERED THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  THE LATEST AND MOST VISIBLE EXAMPLE WAS AHMAD </p><p>`ABUD, WHO OUR SOURCE SAID WAS ONE OF SYRIA\'S MOST POWERFUL </p><p>MILITARY MEN SIX YEARS AGO (IN CHARGE OF PERSONNEL </p><p>ASSIGNMENTS).  THREE YEARS AGO, HOWEVER, `ABUD WAS STRIPPED </p><p>OF REAL AUTHORITY, AND FINALLY, IN JANUARY, BASHAR ORDERED </p><p>HE BE KICKED OUT OF THE MILITARY COMPLETELY. </p><p> </p><p>-- UP TO A "DOZEN OFFICERS" HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE PAST </p><p>TWO MONTHS AT BASHAR\'S BEHEST.  THESE ARRESTS HAD NOTHING TO </p><p>DO WITH THE ATTACKS ON THE EMBASSY, RATHER THEY WERE </p><p>INTENDED TO SHOW INTOLERANCE FOR CORRUPTION (NOTE:  AND </p><p>APPARENTLY TO DEMONSTRATE BASHAR\'S "TOUGH GUY" CREDENTIALS). </p><p>AMONG THOSE ARRESTED, THE HEAD OF SMI\'S ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>MISSIONS OFFICE (IDARAT AL-MUHIMMAT), ANOTHER OFFICER </p><p>IDENTIFIED AS HASAN AL-`ALI (NOTE:  EMBASSY HOLDINGS </p><p>IDENTIFY HIM AS THE COMMANDER OF THE ELECTRONIC WARFARE </p><p>ACADEMY, A REPORT WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH REF A INDICATIONS </p><p>THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN "REMOVED" FROM HIS JOB), AND </p><p>ANOTHER OFFICER IDENTIFIED AS H. `ABBAS.  (NOTE:  WE WILL </p><p>ATTEMPT TO INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM THESE REPORTS OF ARRESTS.) </p><p> </p><p>-- THE HOUSE DEMOLITIONS (REF B) IN SLUNFE AND YA`FUR WERE </p><p>ENTIRELY BASHAR\'S INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ANOTHER SOURCE WITH EXCELLENT CONNECTIONS IN THE </p><p>MILITARY TOLD EMBOFFS JANUARY 13 THAT ALL OF SYRIA\'S SENIOR </p><p>MILITARY LEADERSHIP PAST RETIREMENT AGE (E.G., `ALI DUBA, </p><p>MUSTAFA TALAS), WILL BE REPLACED BY NEXT JULY (IN THE NEXT </p><p>ROUND OF PROMTOIONS/RETIREMENTS).  OUR SOURCE SAID THE </p><p>CHANGES WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT AND UNPARALLELED.   HE SAID </p><p>THAT, ALTHOUGH ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF `ALI `ASLAN HAD BEEN </p><p>GRANTED AN EXTENSION, HE TOO WOULD BE GONE BY JULY.  THIS </p><p>SOURCE SAID THERE HAD BEEN GREAT SURPRISE (AMONG THE </p><p>MILITARY) AT THE LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNGER OFFICERS WHO WERE </p><p>FORCED OUT THIS ROUND, AND IMPLIED IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE </p><p>NOT A GOOD FIT WITH BASHAR. </p><p> </p><p>LEADERSHIP\'S ECONOMIC BLINDERS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) OUR FIRST CONTACT ALSO CONFIRMED OUR LONG-HELD </p><p>SUSPICION THAT THE SYRIAN LEADERSHIP HAS NO REAL SENSE OF </p><p>THE ECONOMIC REALITIES OF THE COUNTRY.  HE SAID THAT, PARTLY </p><p>PRODDED BY DISCUSSIONS WITH ECONCHIEF (ABOUT THE EMBASSY\'S </p><p>DRAFT REPORT ON SYRIA\'S ECONOMY IN 1997/98), HE APPROACHED </p><p>SENIOR "POLITICAL" FIGURES (NOTE:  USUALLY BASHAR) TO </p><p>COMPLAIN THAT SARG DATA IS NOT A COGENT BASIS FOR ECONOMIC </p><p>ANALYSIS.  HE WAS APPARENTLY GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE </p><p>HIS CASE ON THIS POINT AND PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS FOR </p><p>IMPROVEMENT.  THE CONTACT ALSO SAID HE WAS AUTHORIZED TO </p><p>PROVIDE FURTHER DATA TO ENHANCE THE DRAFT EMBASSY REPORT. </p><p>(COMMENT:  WHILE WORTH PURSUING, WE EXPECT SARG STONEWALLING </p><p>IF WE REQUEST INFORMATION ON MILITARY EXPENDITURES, OIL </p><p>INCOME, OR OFFICIAL RESERVES.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE PREVIOUS DAY, THE CONTACT HAD ADVISED THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE UMBRAGE AT THE EMBASSY\'S </p><p>(UNCLASSIFIED) ANALYSIS, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SEEN AS AN </p><p>"OFFICIAL" CRITICISM OF SYRIA\'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.  SHE </p><p>PROTESTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST UNDERSTAND THAT EMBASSIES </p><p>ARE EXPECTED TO PREPARE A BARE MINIMUM OF OBJECTIVE ECONOMIC </p><p>REPORTING -- AND SAID SHE HAD MADE VERY CLEAR TO SARG </p><p>CONTACTS THAT SHE WOULD CONSIDER AMENDING HER REPORT IF THEY </p><p>AGREED TO BACK UP THEIR ASSERTIONS WITH HARD DATA.  OUR </p><p>CONTACT SHOOK HIS HEAD, SAYING "THE SARG DOES NOT UNDERSTAND </p><p>THAT ANY BUSINESSMEN OR ACADEMIC WOULD HAVE ANY NEED FOR </p><p>SUCH REPORTS."  ECONCHIEF PERSISTED, WONDERING HOW THE SARG </p><p>COULD FEIGN DISPLEASURE WHEN MOST OF SYRIA\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>SHORTCOMINGS (AND ITS STATISTICAL REPORTING) WERE </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED EACH YEAR IN THE IMF\'S ARTICLE IV REPORT.  HE </p><p>LAUGHED AT OUR NAIVETE AND SAID THAT THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP </p><p>MAKES NO EFFORT TO READ, MUCH LESS UNDERSTAND, THE IMF </p><p>REPORTS, WHICH WERE TOO LONG.  GETTING THEIR ATTENTION FOR </p><p>HIS OWN ENDEAVOR, THEREFORE, HE FELT, WAS SOMETHING OF A </p><p>MIRACLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CROCKER </p><p></p></div>
