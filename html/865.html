(U)  CLASSIFIED BY WILLIAM A. STANTON, POLMINCOUNS. </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IN AN OTHERWISE CORDIAL JANUARY 28 </p><p>BREAKFAST MEETING WITH CONGRESSMAN ACKERMAN, ASSISTANT </p><p>MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS YANG JIECHI PASSIONATELY </p><p>ARGUED THAT CHINA HAD NOT REPEALED THE HONG KONG BILL OF </p><p>RIGHTS.  CHINA, YANG SAID, WAS MERELY TRYING TO MAKE THE </p><p>BILL OF RIGHTS COMPATIBLE WITH THE SUPREMACY OF THE BASIC </p><p>LAW.  THE BASIC LAW, HE STATED, ALREADY PROVIDED FOR </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND FREEDOM </p><p>OF THE PRESS.  YANG COMMENTED HONG KONG\'S SUCCESSFUL </p><p>REVERSION TO CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY COULD PERHAPS BE THE </p><p>MODEL FOR RESOLVING THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN.  NOTING CHINA\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC SUCCESSES AND THE EXPECTATION THAT FOREIGN TRADE </p><p>WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW, YANG EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT WITH </p><p>"FEWER RESTRICTIONS" SINO-U.S. TRADE WOULD ALSO </p><p>INCREASE.  YANG SAID HE WAS PLEASED THAT CHINA AND THE </p><p>UNITED STATES NOW SHARED A MORE COMMON UNDERSTANDING ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS.  WITH EVIDENT PRIDE, YANG NOTED THAT THE </p><p>CHINESE PRESS WAS NOW SO RELIABLE THAT THE STATE </p><p>DEPARTMENT USED FIGURES PROVIDED BY THE CHINESE MEDIA IN </p><p>ITS HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ON CHINA.  AS FOR TAIWAN, YANG </p><p>SAID THAT HONG KONG\'S SUCCESSFUL REVERSION TO CHINESE </p><p>SOVEREIGNTYCOULD PERHAPS SERVE AS THE MODEL FOR </p><p>RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ACKERMAN ASSURED YANG THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS </p><p>NOT SIDING WITH BRITAIN AGAINST CHINA ON THE ISSUE OF </p><p>HONG KONG.  THE UNITED STATES WAS CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF HONG KONG AND THEIR LEVEL OF FREEDOMS FOLLOWING </p><p>REVERSION.  ACKERMAN AGREED THAT THE CHINESE ECONOMY WAS </p><p>DOING WELL, AND HOPED THAT WITH FAIR MARKET ACCESS, </p><p>SINO-U.S. TRADE WOULD GROW.  ON HUMAN RIGHTS, ACKERMAN </p><p>SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT MFN AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS SHOULD BE LINKED, IT WAS NONETHELESS IMPORTANT </p><p>THAT CHINA CONTINUE TO SHOW PROGRESS IN THIS AREA IF IT </p><p>HOPED TO AVOID THE ANNUAL MFN REVIEW.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  ON JANUARY 28 ASSISTANT MINISTER OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS YANG JIECHI HOSTED A BREAKFAST MEETING FOR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE GARY ACKERMAN.  DAVID ADAMS (SPECIAL </p><p>ASSISTANT T0 ACKERMAN), REGGIE LIU (ASSISTANT TO </p><p>ACKERMAN), POLMINCOUNS AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER) ACCOMPANIED </p><p>ACKERMAN.  NORTH AMERICAN AND OCEANIAN AFFAIRS DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL LIU XIAOMING, FIRST SECRETARY XIE FENG, </p><p>CPIFA EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER XIAO HOUDE ACCOMPANIED </p><p>YANG. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) NOTING THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT THE CONGRESSMAN HAD </p><p>HAD A SUCCESSFUL MEETING WITH VICE PREMIER/FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER QIAN QICHEN THE PREVIOUS DAY, YANG EXPRESSED THE </p><p>HOPE THAT THE CONGRESSMAN WOULD ENCOURAGE HIS COLLEAGUES </p><p>ON THE HILL TO VISIT CHINA IN ORDER THAT THEY TOO MIGHT </p><p>BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION IN CHINA.  ACKERMAN, </p><p>THANKING YANG FOR HOSTING THE BREAKFAST, ASSURED YANG </p><p>THAT HE WOULD DO S0. </p><p> </p><p>HONG KONG </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ACKERMAN, NOTING THAT HE HAD JUST COME FROM HONG </p><p>KONG, OBSERVED THAT THE HONG KONG BUSINESS COMMUNITY </p><p>SEEMED CONFIDENT THAT THE TRANSITION WOULD PROCEED </p><p>SMOOTHLY.  SOME OF ACKERMAN\'S CONTACTS IN HONG KONG HAD </p><p>EXPRESSED SOME APPREHENSION, HOWEVER, BECAUSE CHINA WAS </p><p>RESCINDING THE BILL OF RIGHTS.  NO ONE, ACKERMAN SAID, </p><p>COULD TOLERATE FREEDOMS BEING TAKEN AWAY.  IN ADDITION </p><p>BECAUSE THERE WAS NO APPARENT THREAT TO THE HONG KONG </p><p>GOVERNMENT, IT APPEARED THAT CHINA HAD ARBITRARILY TAKEN </p><p>THIS ACTION.  ACKERMAN STATED THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF HONG KONG WERE PAWNS BETWEEN TWO SQUABBLING </p><p>POWERS -- CHINA AND BRITAIN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) VISIBLY ANNOYED, YANG COUNTERED THAT CHINA WAS </p><p>NOT RESCINDING OR REPEALING THE BILL OF RIGHTS.  IN FACT, </p><p>CHINA WAS ONLY TRYING TO MAKE THE BILL OF RIGHTS </p><p>COMPATIBLE WITH THE SUPREMACY OF THE BASIC LAW.  YANG </p><p>BLAMED THE WESTERN MEDIA FOR THE INCORRECT PERCEPTION OF </p><p>THE ACTIONS CHINA HAD TAKEN.  YANG STATED THAT THE </p><p>WESTERN MEDIA WERE ALWAYS CRITICAL OF CHINA\'S ACTIONS IN </p><p>HONG KONG AND RARELY CRITICAL OF BRITAIN.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>YANG, THE BASIC LAW ALREADY PROVIDED FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND FREEDOM OF THE </p><p>PRESS.  NOTING THAT BRITAIN DID NOT HAVE A BILL OF </p><p>RIGHTS, YANG ASKED RHETORICALLY WHY HONG KONG NEEDED A </p><p>BILL OF RIGHTS IF BRITAIN DID NOT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) YANG MAINTAINED THAT THE BRITISH, "BELIEVING THAT </p><p>THEY COULD DO WHATEVER THEY LIKED," HAD MADE THE BILL OF </p><p>RIGHTS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE BASIC LAW.  THIS WAS IN </p><p>DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF THE AGREEMENT THAT CHINA AND THE </p><p>U.K. SIGNED IN 1984.  YANG EMPHATICALLY STATED THAT CHINA </p><p>WOULD "NOT SWALLOW" BRITAIN\'S ATTEMPTS TO PUT CHINA "IN </p><p>ITS PLACE."  "THIS IS NOT THE OPIUM WAR.  WE WILL THROW </p><p>IT BACK," YANG DECLARED.  YANG, WITH OBVIOUS ANGER, GAVE </p><p>A THUMBNAIL SKETCH OF THE OPIUM WAR AND REITERATED THAT </p><p>CHINA WOULD NOT AGAIN BE PUSHED AROUND. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ACKERMAN ASSURED YANG THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS </p><p>NOT TAKING SIDES WITH THE BRITISH AGAINST CHINA.  HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT HIS ONLY CONCERN WAS THAT THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>HONG KONG SHOULD BE TREATED FAIRLY.  BEIJING SHOULD </p><p>REASSURE THE PEOPLE OF HONG KONG THAT THEIR WAY OF LIFE </p><p>WOULD REMAIN THE SAME FOLLOWING REVERSION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) YANG SAID THAT CHINA HOPED TO MAINTAIN GOOD </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN AFTER JULY 1997.  TOWARD </p><p>THAT END, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER HESELTINE HAD VISITED </p><p>CHINA ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS.  RECENTLY, DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER CHI HAOTIAN HAD ST0PPED IN LONDON ON HIS WAY TO </p><p>THE UNITED STATES.  IN FEBRUARY, FOREIGN MINISTER QIAN </p><p>WOULD MEET WITH FOREIGN MINISTER RIFKIND AT THE ASEM </p><p>MEETING IN SINGAPORE.  ONCE THE "HIST0RICAL LEGACY" OF </p><p>HONG KONG WAS RESOLVED, YANG FORESAW NO REASON WHY </p><p>SINO-U.K. RELATIONS WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. </p><p> </p><p>TRADE </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) YANG PROVIDED A BRIEF OVERVIEW 0F CHINA\'S </p><p>ECONOMY, POINTING OUT THAT LAST YEAR THE ECONOMY HAD </p><p>GROWN BY 9.7%     IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, 12IN </p><p>THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR, AND 8IN THE SERVICE SECTOR. </p><p>CHINA\'S BILATERAL TRADE REACHED USD 300 BILLION, PLACING </p><p>IT LLTH IN THE WORLD, YANG SAID.  PREDICTING THAT CHINA\'S </p><p>ECONOMY WOULD CONTINUE TO EXPAND, YANG EXPRESSED THE HOPE </p><p>THAT CHINA\'S BILATERAL TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES WOULD </p><p>ALSO INCREASE.  FOLLOWING A DECADE OR SO OF STRUCTURED </p><p>REFORM, MANY U.S. COMPANIES --  FOR EXAMPLE BOEING -- </p><p>WERE IN A POSITION TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE FOR CHINA\'S </p><p>BUSINESS.  YANG SAID THAT WITH "FEWER RESTRICTIONS" </p><p>NORMAL TRADE SHOULD INCREASE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) YANG MAINTAINED THAT THE U.S. AND CHINESE </p><p>ECONOMIES WERE COMPLEMENTARY, IN CONTRAST TO THE U.S. AND </p><p>JAPANESE ECONOMIES WHICH WERE COMPETITIVE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>YANG, MANY LARGE U.S. COMPANIES, INCLUDING BOEING AND </p><p>AT&T, WERE DOING WELL IN CHINA.  NOTING THAT NEW YORK WAS </p><p>AN INDUSTRIAL "POWERHOUSE IN QUITE A FEW AREAS," YANG </p><p>ENCOURAGED CONGRESSMAN ACKERMAN TO LOOK TO CHINA AS A </p><p>PLACE TO DO BUSINESS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) ACKERMAN RESPONDED THAT HE WAS ENCOURAGED BY </p><p>YANG\'S REFRESHING VIEWS, ADDING THAT HE AGREED WITH </p><p>ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT YANG HAD SAID.  WHILE HE ALSO </p><p>WANTED T0 INCREASE BILATERAL TRADE, ACKERMAN STATED THAT </p><p>HE WAS NONETHELESS CONCERNED ABOUT FAIR MARKET ACCESS. </p><p>ANOTHER CONCERN WAS HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) CONTINUING, ACKERMAN SAID THAT HE BELIEVED THAT </p><p>MFN AND HUMAN RIGHTS SHOULD NOT BE LINKED.  HOWEVER, IT </p><p>WAS IMPORTANT THAT CHINA CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS IN </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS IF IT HOPED TO AVOID THE ANNUAL MFN REVIEW. </p><p>AS U.S. CONFIDENCE IN CHINA VIS-A-VIS HUMAN RIGHTS GREW, </p><p>SINO-U.S. RELATIONS WOULD ALSO IMPROVE.  RESPONDING, YANG </p><p>EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT PERMANENT MFN FOR CHINA WOULD NOT </p><p>BE TOO FAR OFF. </p><p> </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) ON HUMAN RIGHTS, YANG SAID THAT HE WAS PLEASED </p><p>THAT THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA NOW SHARED A MORE COMMON </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ISSUE.  SEVERAL YEARS BACK, THE </p><p>UNITED STATES DEFINED HUMAN RIGHTS ONLY IN TERMS 0F CIVIL </p><p>RIGHTS, YANG SAID.  IN CONTRAST, THE UNITED STATES NOW </p><p>RECOGNIZED THAT THE PEOPLE\'S LEVEL 0F SUBSISTENCE AND </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WERE ALSO IMPORTANT.  YANG MADE THE </p><p>POINT THAT MUCH OF CHINA\'S BAD IMAGE IN THE UNITED STATES </p><p>ON THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS WAS DUE TO BIASED AMERICAN </p><p>REPORTING.  CITING A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE WALL STREET </p><p>JOURNAL, YANG SAID THAT HE AGREED WITH SEVERAL AMERICAN </p><p>SCHOLARS QUOTED IN THE ARTICLE THAT T0O 0FTEN "THE OTHER </p><p>SIDE OF THE STORY" IN CHINA, THE MORE POSITIVE STORY, WAS </p><p>NOT REPORTED. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) ACKERMAN REPLIED THAT WHILE NO GOVERNMENT OR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL LIKED TO BE CRITICIZED, A FREE PRESS </p><p>WAS NECESSARY TO INSURE THAT GOVERNMENTS DID NOT BECOME </p><p>OPPRESSIVE.  THE PRESS, HE SAID, HAD AT TIMES CAUSED HIM </p><p>SOME PAIN, BUT HE NONETHELESS BELIEVED THAT A FREE PRESS </p><p>MUST BE ACCOMMODATED. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) YANG SAID THAT THE CHINESE PRESS WAS TRYING TO </p><p>COMPETE WITH THE FOREIGN PRESS AS A CREDIBLE SOURCE OF </p><p>INFORMATI0N.  T0WARD THAT END, THE CHINESE MEDIA </p><p>REGULARLY AND TRUTHFULLY REPORTED ON ISSUES SUCH AS LOCAL </p><p>CRIME.  WITH EVIDENT PRIDE, YANG SAID THAT "EVEN THE U.S. </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT" USED FIGURES PROVIDED BY THE CHINESE </p><p>MEDIA WHEN REPORTING ON ISSUES SUCH AS VILLAGE ELECTIONS </p><p>AND ABUSES OF POWER BY THE POLICE.  THE CHINESE PRESS WAS </p><p>NOT MERELY PROPAGANDA -- "LIKE IN THE OLD DAYS" -- YANG </p><p>ASSERTED. </p><p> </p><p>TAIWAN </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) YANG MAINTAINED THAT TAIWAN PRESIDENT LEE </p><p>TENG-HUI WOULD FAIL IN HIS EFFORTS TO SLOW TRADE BETWEEN </p><p>THE MAINLAND AND TAIWAN.  ACCORDING T0 YANG, THE RECENTLY </p><p>ANNOUNCED DIRECT SHIPPING ROUTES WERE ANOTHER BOOST TO </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE.  YANG SAID THAT HONG KONG\'S SUCCESSFUL </p><p>REVERSION TO CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY COULD PERHAPS SERVE AS </p><p>THE MODEL FOR RESOLVING THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U) REPRESENTATIVE ACKERMAN DID NOT HAVE THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR THIS CABLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCCAHILL </p><p></p></div>
