TAURAN OFFERED THE ACTIVE </p><p>COOPERATION OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN IRAQ TO FACILITATE FOOD </p><p>AND MEDICINE DISTRIBUTION AND PREVENT LOCAL MAFIAS FROM </p><p>PROFITING ON SUCH DISTRIBUTION, AND BOLTON ACCEPTED HIS </p><p>OFFER.  TAURAN AND OTHERS URGED THAT THE UN BE GIVEN AN </p><p>IMPORTANT ROLE IN IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION, AND CALLED ON THE </p><p>U.S. TO INVOLVE AS MANY COUNTRIES AS POSSIBLE IN THE PROCESS </p><p>OF REBUILDING IRAQ AND IN DEALING WITH CONTINUING WMD THREATS </p><p>FROM NORTH KOREA, IRAN AND SYRIA.  TAURAN WELCOMED BOLTON\'S </p><p>AFFIRMATION OF THE U.S. DESIRE TO INTENSIFY OUR EFFORTS TO </p><p>OVERCOME THE CURRENT ARAB-ISRAELI IMPASSE.  RUINI EXPRESSED </p><p>HIS CONFIDENCE THAT SCENES OF JUBILANT IRAQI\'S WOULD </p><p>DRAMATICALLY SHIFT EUROPEAN OPINION ABOUT THE WAR.

TAURAN AND HIS </p><p>COLLEAGUES MADE CLEAR THAT THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED IN </p><p>CONTINUING A DEBATE ON THE MERITS OF WAR, BUT WERE LOOKING </p><p>AHEAD AT HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND IRAQ\'S FUTURE.  "THE DECISION </p><p>WAS TAKEN.  THAT\'S DONE, AND WE RESPECT THE DECISION THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN," TAURAN SAID.  RUINI LIKEWISE RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD WEIGHED THE DECISION CAREFULLY AND </p><p>THAT IT WAS CLEAR THE UNITED STATES WAS DOING EVERYTHING </p><p>POSSIBLE TO PREVENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THE CONDUCT OF THE </p><p>WAR. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>OFFER TO FACILITATE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN LIGHT OF THE HOLY SEE\'S PREOCCUPATION WITH THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SITUATION, TAURAN TOLD UNDER SECRETARY BOLTON </p><p>THAT THE CHALDEAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN IRAQ HAD AN EFFECTIVE, </p><p>WELL-ORGANIZED NETWORK IN KEY IRAQI CITIES THAT WOULD BE ABLE </p><p>TO FACILITATE THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOODS AND MEDICINES.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01570  01 OF 03  131013Z </p><p>APOSTOLIC NUNCIO IN BAGHDAD, MONSIGNOR FERNANDO FILONI, HAD </p><p>REPORTED TO TAURAN THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF NEUTRAL POINTS OF </p><p>DISTRIBUTION, LOCAL MAFIAS WERE SPRINGING UP, TAKING THE </p><p>GOODS, AND PROFITEERING.  ACCORDING TO THE NUNCIO, THE LOCAL </p><p>CHURCHES WERE WILLING TO HELP AVERT THIS.  TAURAN SAID HE HAS </p><p>ASKED THE LOCAL BISHOPS TO MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO MEET </p><p>WITH U.S. FORCES AND HUMANITARIAN AID PROVIDERS, AND PROVIDED </p><p>NAMES OF BISHOPS IN KEY CITIES (REF A).  U/S BOLTON ACCEPTED </p><p>TAURAN\'S OFFER AND PROMISED TO PASS ALONG THE NAMES TO THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S POLITICAL-MILITARY ACTION TEAM.  TAURAN SAID HE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SITUATION IN THE HOSPITALS WAS THE MOST </p><p>DRAMATIC AND IN NEED OF SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>UN ROLE </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE HOLY SEE HAS PUBLICLY SUPPORTED A PROMINENT ROLE </p><p>FOR THE UN IN IRAQI RELIEF AND RECONSTRUCTION, AND CARDINALS </p><p>RUINI AND STAFFORD ADVOCATED THAT THE U.S. SEEK TO INVOLVE AS </p><p>MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AS POSSIBLE IN THIS PROCESS.

FOR T U/S BOLTON, EUR, EUR/WE-MENNUTI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN LOOKING FORWARD: U/S BOLTON REVIEWS </p><p>POST-WAR IRAQ AND GLOBAL WMD THREATS WITH HOLY SEE FM AND </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>DISSIPATE.  BOLTON RESPONDED THAT THE UN WOULD, AS THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HAD STATED, PLAY A VITAL ROLE.  HOWEVER, IT WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01570  02 OF 03  131014Z </p><p>IMPORTANT NOT TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN THEOLOGICAL DEBATES ABOUT </p><p>THE NATURE OF THIS ROLE.  THE ISSUE AT HAND WAS NOT WHETHER </p><p>THE U.S. OR UN WOULD CONTROL IRAQ, BUT HOW SOON CONTROL COULD </p><p>BE TURNED OVER TO A LEGITIMATE IRAQI AUTHORITY.  IN THE </p><p>MEANTIME, IT WAS VITAL TO CONCENTRATE ON RESOLVING PRACTICAL </p><p>ISSUES TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  IN THIS, THE </p><p>UN WOULD PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE, BOLTON ASSURED HIS </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS.  TAURAN CONCURRED THAT THIS WAS VITAL, AND </p><p>OBSERVED THAT THE IRAQI PEOPLE WERE "INTELLECTUALLY </p><p>WELL-EQUIPPED," WHICH WOULD FACILITATE AN EARLY TRANSITION TO </p><p>IRAQI AUTHORITY.  TO REINFORCE THIS POINT HE QUOTED AN ARAB </p><p>APHORISM THAT "BOOKS WERE WRITTEN IN CAIRO, PRINTED IN </p><p>LEBANON, AND READ IN BAGHDAD."  BOLTON AFFIRMED THAT THE U.S. </p><p>HAD NO DESIRE FOR A LONG OCCUPATION.  OUR GOALS, HE ADDED, </p><p>WERE TO FIND AND DESTROY WMD, PRESERVE EXTERNAL SECURITY IN </p><p>THE SHORT-TERM, AND TURN AUTHORITY OVER TO LEGITIMATE, </p><p>DEMOCRATIC IRAQI AUTHORITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  RUINI ALSO </p><p>WELCOMED THIS COMMITMENT, OBSERVING "IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO </p><p>TURN AUTHORITY OVER TO IRAQI\'S IN A SHORT TIME, THAT WOULD BE </p><p>IDEAL." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>THE BROADER WMD THREAT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) WITH ALL OF HIS VATICAN INTERLOCUTORS, BOLTON REVIEWED </p><p>THE BROADER WMD THREAT, STRESSING THAT WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>DESTRUCTION ARE NOT MILITARY WEAPONS, AND CAN ONLY BE USED TO </p><p>KILL CIVILIANS, AS SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD WITH HIS OWN PEOPLE. </p><p>ALL VATICAN INTERLOCUTORS EXPRESSED CONCERN WITH WHAT HAPPENS </p><p>NEXT, NOTING FEARS THAT THE WAR ON IRAQ COULD BE FOLLOWED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01570  02 OF 03  131014Z </p><p>WITH OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST IRAN, SYRIA, OR NORTH KOREA. </p><p>BOLTON MADE CLEAR THAT IRAQ WAS NOT A MODEL FOR NORTH KOREA, </p><p>IRAN OR SYRIA, AND THAT THERE IS NO \'COOKIE CUTTER\' APPROACH </p><p>TO RESOLVING THESE ISSUES.  HE POINTED OUT THAT WE WERE </p><p>ACTIVELY PURSUING DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES IN ALL OF THESE </p><p>CASES, AND THAT WE HOPED THESE COUNTRIES WOULD DRAW THE RIGHT </p><p>LESSON FROM THE IRAQ EXAMPLE:  THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH IT FOR </p><p>THEM TO CONTINUE PURSUING WMD.  ALL THREE VATICAN OFFICIALS </p><p>EXPRESSED THEIR BELIEF THAT THE U.S. SHOULD SEEK TO WORK WITH </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES IN A MULTILATERAL EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THESE </p><p>THREATS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) TURNING TO SPECIFIC COUNTRIES, TAURAN FOCUSED FIRST </p><p>ON NORTH KOREA, ABOUT WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE HOLY SEE HAD </p><p>LIMITED UNDERSTANDING.  BOLTON REVIEWED THE BACKGROUND TO THE </p><p>DISCOVERY OF THE NORTH KOREAN PROGRAM AND OUR EFFORTS TO </p><p>PERSUADE NORTH KOREA TO ABANDON ITS PROGRAM.  HE EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT WE WERE ACTIVELY TRYING TO ENGAGE CHINA AND RUSSIA TO </p><p>BECOME MORE INVOLVED, WHILE WORKING WITH JAPAN AND SOUTH </p><p>KOREA.  HE POINTED OUT THE HIGH STAKES INVOLVED, GIVEN </p><p>SUPPORT IN JAPAN FOR A NUCLEAR PROGRAM TO COUNTER A NORTH </p><p>KOREAN THREAT AND THE SUBSEQUENT POTENTIAL FOR AN ASIAN ARMS </p><p>RACE BETWEEN JAPAN AND CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ON IRAN, BOLTON OUTLINED LONG-STANDING CONCERNS THAT </p><p>IRAN WAS PURSUING A COMPLETE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM THAT WOULD </p><p>GIVE THE IRANIANS THE CAPACITY TO MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  HE </p><p>REVIEWED OUR EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE RUSSIA TO CUT OFF </p><p>ASSISTANCE, AND THE FINDINGS FROM THE RECENT VISIT OF THE </p><p>IAEA INSPECTORS, WHICH SURPRISED MANY IN THE IAEA.  TAURAN </p><p>ASKED WHETHER WE FOUND RUSSIA TO BE A RELIABLE INTERLOCUTOR, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01570  02 OF 03  131014Z </p><p>NOTING THAT THE HOLY SEE FOUND THEY HAD GOOD RESULTS FROM TOP </p><p>RUSSIAN LEADERSHIP, BUT THAT THERE WAS NO FOLLOW THROUGH FROM </p><p>OTHER PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.  TAURAN ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>THE HOLY SEE REGARDED IRAN AS "A KEY COUNTRY" IN THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST AND URGED THAT WE SUPPORT ANY SIGNS OF A "DEMOCRATIC </p><p>OPENING."  BOLTON SAID WE REMAINED DEEPLY CONCERNED BY RECENT </p><p>SYRIAN ACTIONS AS WELL AS SYRIA\'S CONTINUED PURSUIT OF WMD. </p><p>TAURAN SAID HE BELIEVED THE BRITISH COULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT </p><p>ROLE WITH SYRIA, WHILE BOLTON NOTED THAT THE FRENCH COULD </p><p>ALSO BE CONSTRUCTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>REINVIGORATING MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) BOLTON ASSURED TAURAN AND THE OTHER OFFICIALS THAT THE </p><p>U.S. WAS COMMITTED TO REINVIGORATING OUR EFFORTS TO RESOLVE </p><p>THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CRISIS ONCE THE IRAQ CRISIS WAS </p><p>BEHIND US.  HE ADDED THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD DEEPEN HIS </p><p>ALREADY CONSIDERABLE INVOLVEMENT ONCE THE NEW PALESTINIAN </p><p>PRIME MINISTER WAS IN PLACE AND HAD AUTHORITY TO ACT </p><p>EFFECTIVELY.  TAURAN WELCOMED THIS COMMITMENT, COMMENTING </p><p>THAT THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN DISPUTE WAS "THE MOTHER OF ALL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2800 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01570  03 OF 03  131014Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   PERC-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   MED-07   NEA-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  DHS-00   PM-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    T-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   G-00     SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------54FF41  131014Z /38 </p><p>O 131014Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>ISLAMIC CONFERENCE COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>MERCOSUR COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>WHITE HOUSE NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 VATICAN 001570 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

(C) BOTH CARDINALS SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>AVOIDING PERCEPTIONS OF A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS BETWEEN THE </p><p>MUSLIM WORLD AND THE WEST -- A RECENT PREOCCUPATION OF THE </p><p>HOLY SEE (SEPTEL).  CARDINAL STAFFORD RECOUNTED AN EXPERIENCE </p><p>CHAIRING A MEETING IN LEBANON WHERE HE WAS SHARPLY CRITICIZED </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS AMERICAN NATIONALITY, AND SAID THE DEPTH OF </p><p>HOSTILITY TOWARD THE UNITED STATES WAS DEEPLY TROUBLING TO </p><p>HIM.  WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT CRITICISM CAME WITH THE </p><p>TERRITORY OF BEING THE ONLY SUPERPOWER, HE ALSO BELIEVED THAT </p><p>THE U.S. NEEDED TO ACT WITH HUMILITY AND DO A BETTER JOB OF </p><p>DEMONSTRATING OUR CONCERN FOR THE PRIORITIES OF OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>OVERCOMING TRANSATLANTIC TENSIONS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) CARDINAL RUINI, ONE OF THE POPE\'S CLOSEST </p><p>COLLABORATORS AND SOMEONE CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR TO </p><p>JOHN PAUL II, EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN FOR THE WEAKENING OF NATO </p><p>AND THE UN AS A RESULT OF THE IRAQ CRISIS, AND URGED THAT WE </p><p>ENSURE BOTH INSTITUTIONS ARE REPAIRED.  AS PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE, RUINI IS PLUGGED INTO THE </p><p>DOMESTIC ITALIAN POLITICAL SCENE, AND CITED HIS CONCERN THAT </p><p>ITALY -- WHICH USED TO BE PRO-U.S. -- WAS LOSING THIS </p><p>ORIENTATION.  HE CITED A SIMILAR WORRYING TREND IN GERMANY. </p><p>HE NOTED A DISTRUST OF FRANCE, WHICH HE NOTED HARBORED GLOBAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01570  03 OF 03  131014Z </p><p>AMBITIONS THAT WERE ALIEN TO ITALY AND GERMANY AFTER WWII. </p><p>ALTHOUGH MOST ITALIANS REMAINED WARY OF THE FRENCH, RUINI </p><p>WORRIED THAT THE FRENCH APPROACH COULD BECOME DOMINANT IN </p><p>EUROPE UNLESS CURRENT DIVISIONS WERE REPAIRED.  THE KEY TO </p><p>DOING SO, ACCORDING TO RUINI, WAS TO "MAKE CLEAR THE U.S WAS </p><p>FOR PEACE."  IN THIS REGARD, HE OBSERVED THAT IMAGES OF </p><p>IRAQIS WARMLY WELCOMING AMERICAN TROOPS IN THE DAYS AHEAD </p><p>WOULD HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON EUROPEAN PUBLIC OPINION.  "IF THE </p><p>FUTURE GOES WELL," HE CONCLUDED, "THE PAST WILL LOSE ITS </p><p>IMPORTANCE."  BOLTON ASSURED RUINI THAT THE WORLD WOULD SEE </p><p>THAT THE U.S. MOTIVES WERE EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD SAID THEY WERE </p><p>-- ELIMINATE THE WMD THREAT, END A BRUTAL DICTATORSHIP, AND </p><p>GIVE THE IRAQI PEOPLE A CHANCE FOR A BETTER LIFE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMING ON THE MORNING OF THE COLLAPSE OF BAGHDAD, </p><p>BOLTON\'S VISIT SERVED TO PUT AN END TO THE PRE-WAR PERIOD OF </p><p>DIVISION OVER THE NECESSITY OF RESORT TO FORCE AND TO REFOCUS </p><p>THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP ON THE FUTURE FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE </p><p>AND OUR BROADER AGENDA, INCLUDING THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN </p><p>CONFLICT.  A PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER THE MEETINGS WITH OVER </p><p>THIRTY MEMBERS OF INTERNATIONAL, CATHOLIC, AND ITALIAN MEDIA </p><p>EVOKED ALMOST UNIVERSALLY POSITIVE COVERAGE OF WARMING </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VATICAN, WHILE HIGHLIGHTING </p><p>U.S. APPRECIATION FOR THE HOLY SEE\'S WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE </p><p>IN HUMANITARIAN RELIEF EFFORTS.  THE HOLY SEE IS CLEARLY </p><p>READY TO MOVE ON FROM THE PERCEPTION OF DIVISION GENERATED BY </p><p>THE RUN-UP TO WAR AND TO MOVE AHEAD WITH HUMANITARIAN RELIEF, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01570  03 OF 03  131014Z </p><p>A REINVIGORATED MIDDLE EAST PEACE EFFORT, AND CONTINUED </p><p>EFFORTS TO BUILD BRIDGES BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM </p><p>WORLDS.  IN THIS REGARD, AN APRIL 10 PRESS RELEASE FROM THE </p><p>VATICAN CALLED THE EVENTS IN IRAQ "AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT </p><p>AND A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE OF THE </p><p>POPULATION."  THE RELEASE ALSO REITERATED THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>DESIRE TO PROVIDE NECESSARY ASSISTANCE AND TO WORK WITH ALL </p><p>CONCERNED TO CREATE LASTING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p>EMBASSY APPRECIATES UNDER SECRETARY BOLTON\'S TIMELY VISIT AND </p><p>RECOMMENDS WASHINGTON CONTINUE THIS HIGH-LEVEL ENGAGEMENT TO </p><p>EXPAND COOPERATION ON THESE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>12.
