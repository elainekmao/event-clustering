<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000457 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: POSSIBLE CONFLICT OVER BUHARI\'S CAMPAIGN LAUNCHING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 0448 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM T.D. Andrews.  Reasons 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  According to retired Air Vice Marshal Moukhtar </p><p>Mohammed, one of the close advisers to ANPP Presidential </p><p>Candidate Muhammadu Buhari, Buhari plans go ahead with the </p><p>launching of his campaign in Port Harcourt on March 8.  The </p><p>campaign team plans to travel to the area with the body of </p><p>Marshall Harry, his murdered campaign coordinator for the </p><p>south-south zone (Reftel).  The campaign also hopes to hold </p><p>a special mass in Odi, the site of the 2001 massacre of </p><p>civilians by Nigerian military forces, to commemorate </p><p>Harry\'s life and to remember the victims of the attack on </p><p>the village.  "It is tragic, and most of us are shaken up, </p><p>but it is more important now than ever to advance Buhari\'s </p><p>campaign," Moukhtar told Poloff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  According to a source in the Presidency, at least </p><p>a thousand soldiers have been deployed to Port Harcourt to </p><p>help stem any outbreak of violence there in the aftermath </p><p>of Harry\'s death.  Additionally, he stated, Rivers State </p><p>Governor Peter Odili has contacted the Presidency to urge </p><p>Obasanjo to cancel Buhari\'s rally in the area due to </p><p>"security concerns." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COMMENT:  Harry\'s death in close proximity to </p><p>Buhari\'s official campaign starting could serve to inflame </p><p>an already uneasy electorate.  From what it appears, the </p><p>Buhari campaign will exploit Harry\'s exit for all it is </p><p>worth.  They hope it will energize what has been a </p><p>heretofore lackluster, informal campaign and also open a </p><p>door for Buhari to appeal to voters in the important South- </p><p>South region.  This weekend, there may be a potential </p><p>confrontation over campaign rallies.  Buhari, with too much </p><p>to gain from staging the rally, and Odili (and by </p><p>extension, Obasanjo) with much to lose if the memory of </p><p>Marshall Harry does not fade away quickly, could be headed </p><p>for a showdown over the weekend.  If so, this will rachet </p><p>up tensions significantly as Nigeria head into the last </p><p>month before elections. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
