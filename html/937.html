<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 003918 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM/CINCPAC ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/TUELLER </p><p>USIA FOR NEA - LARSEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  05/28/03 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PARM, MNUC, PK </p><p>SUBJ:  POLITICAL OPPOSITION FLAYS NAWAZ FOR DELAYING RESPONSE TO </p><p>      INDIAN NUCLEAR CHALLENGE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A)  ISLAMABAD 3588;  (B)  ISLAMABAD 3827; (C)  ISLAMABAD 3858 (LAHORE 315) </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY ACTING POLCOUNS DAN MOZENA.  REASON:  1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OPPONENTS SEE NAWAZ </p><p>SHARIF\'S HESITATION IN RESPONDING TO THE INDIAN NUCLEAR CHALLENGE </p><p>AS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN POLITICAL AGENDAS. </p><p>PAKISTAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY (PPP) LEADER BENAZIR BHUTTO HAS CALLED FOR </p><p>NAWAZ\'S RESIGNATION AND THE FORMATION OF A "NATIONAL GOVERNMENT." </p><p>THE OPPOSITION COALITION PAKISTANI AWAMI ITTEHAD (PAI) -- OF WHICH </p><p>THE PPP IS THE LARGEST ELEMENT -- HAS DEMANDED THAT PAKISTAN </p><p>CONDUCT A NUCLEAR TEST.  THE ISLAMIC PARTIES (NOT PART OF THE PAI) </p><p>ARE THREATENING TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IF THE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO </p><p>CARRY OUT A NUCLEAR TEST BY MAY 30.  IN PRIVATE, HOWEVER, BENAZIR </p><p>HERSELF (REF C) AS WELL AS THE PPP\'S SPOKESMAN AND ONE OF THE </p><p>PARTY\'S SENATORS SEPARATELY TOLD US THEY FEEL THE TIME IS PAST FOR </p><p>A NUCLEAR TEST IN RESPONSE TO INDIA\'S MAY 11 AND 13 BLASTS. </p><p>DESPITE OPPOSITION ATTEMPTS TO DEPICT HIM AS WEAK AND INDECISIVE, </p><p>A RECENT GALLUP POLL GIVES NAWAZ A 77 PERCENT APPROVAL RATING ON </p><p>HIS HANDLING OF THE NUCLEAR CRISIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PPP SPOKESMAN SEES INDIAN TEST AS "GODSEND" </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  PAKISTAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY (PPP) SPOKESMAN FARHATULLAH BABAR </p><p>TOLD POLOFF MAY 26 THAT INDIA\'S NUCLEAR TESTS ON MAY 11 AND MAY 13 </p><p>WERE A "GODSEND" FOR HIS PARTY\'S EFFORTS TO SHAKE NAWAZ SHARIF\'S </p><p>HOLD ON POWER.  BABAR SAID THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO INDIA\'S </p><p>NUCLEAR TESTS IN KIND HAS NOW BEEN LOST AND IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT </p><p>PAKISTAN REASSERT ITS DETERMINATION TO RETAIN ITS NUCLEAR OPTION </p><p>(WITHOUT CONDUCTING A TEST) AND THAT THE NAWAZ SHARIF GOVERNMENT </p><p>STEP DOWN AND MAKE WAY FOR A "NATIONAL GOVERNMENT" THAT COULD </p><p>EFFECTIVELY CONFRONT THE INDIAN MENACE.  FOLLOWING A SIMILAR LINE, </p><p>PPP SENATOR RAZA RABBANI TOLD POLOFF MAY 26 THAT THE TIME FOR </p><p>PAKISTAN TO RESPOND TO INDIA\'S TEST WITH A TEST OF ITS OWN WOULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN WITHIN 48 TO 72 HOURS AFTER THE INDIAN TESTS.  NOW, HE </p><p>SAID, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS WEAKNESS AND INDECISION </p><p>AND SHOULD STEP ASIDE IN FAVOR OF A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE PPP, THE PAI, AND BHUTTO HERSELF HAVE BEEN SENDING </p><p>MIXED SIGNALS ON THE ISSUE OF A NUCLEAR TEST.  ON MAY 25 BHUTTO </p><p>TOLD LAHORE PO THAT SHE HAS DROPPED HER CALL FOR PAKISTAN TO </p><p>CONDUCT ITS OWN NUCLEAR TEST (REF C).  BUT ON MAY 27, THE PRESS </p><p>QUOTES HER AS SAYING THAT "A NUCLEAR TEST BY PAKISTAN IS NECESSARY </p><p>TO KEEP INDIA AT BAY AND TO REVITALIZE THE STRUGGLE IN KASHMIR." </p><p>FOLLOWING HER MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER GOHAR AYUB ON MAY 22, </p><p>BENAZIR SAID SHE WOULD SUPPORT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN THE EVENT </p><p>OF AN ARMED CONFRONTATION WITH INDIA, BUT THEN REPEATED HER CALL </p><p>FOR THE FORMATION OF A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.  IN LAHORE ON MAY 24, </p><p>THE PAKISTAN AWAMI ITTEHAD -- OF WHICH THE PPP IS THE LARGEST </p><p>COMPONENT -- CALLED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND TO INDIA\'S </p><p>NUCLEAR CHALLENGE BY TESTING A PAKISTANI BOMB, OR TO RESIGN.  THE </p><p>PAI MEETING IN LAHORE WAS ATTENDED BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM 41 </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES IN PAKISTAN (MOST OF WHICH HAVE NO ELECTORAL </p><p>WEIGHT); MINISTER FOR TOURISM SHEIKH RASHID AHMAD ATTENDED TO MAKE </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S CASE.  AFTER DENOUNCING THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS </p><p>WEAK RESPONSE TO THE INDIAN CHALLENGE, BENAZIR BHUTTO ACCUSED NAWAZ </p><p>ET AL OF SPENDING THEIR TIME LOOKING FOR WAYS TO VICTIMIZE HER AND </p><p>HER FAMILY RATHER THAN DEALING WITH THE COUNTRY\'S GRAVE SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION.  MAY 28 PRESS ACCOUNTS REPORT THAT PAI PRESIDENT </p><p>PROFESSOR TAHIRUL QADRI HAS SUPPORTED THE MAY 30 DEADLINE FOR A </p><p>NUCLEAR TEST SET BY THE ISLAMIST PARTIES (SEE BELOW). </p><p> </p><p>ISLAMIC PARTIES DEMAND NUCLEAR TEST </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  ALL OF THE MAJOR ISLAMIC PARTIES, INCLUDING THE JAMAAT-I- </p><p>ISLAMI (JI) LED BY QAZI HUSSAIN AHMAD, THE JAMIAT-UL-ULEMAI ISLAM </p><p>(F)(JUI-F), LED BY MAULANA FAZAL-UR-REHMAN, AND THE FACTION OF THE </p><p>JAMIAT ULEMA E-PAKISTAN (JUP-N) LED BY MAULANA SHAH AHMED NOORANI </p><p>HAVE PUBLICLY CALLED FOR A PAKISTANI NUCLEAR TEST.  REFLECTING </p><p>PERHAPS THE LACK OF PUBLIC DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE ISSUE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE JI\'S CALL FOR A NATIONAL STRIKE ON MAY 22 TO PROTEST </p><p>THE FAILURE TO CONDUCT A TEST WAS LARGELY IGNORED BY SHOPKEEPERS. </p><p>VARIOUS OTHER PARTIES HAVE CALLED FOR A NATIONWIDE PROTEST CAMPAIGN </p><p>IF A TEST DOES NOT TAKE PLACE BY MAY 30.  IRONICALLY, IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN THE TALIBAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>JI AND THE JUI-F, HAS ENDORSED PAKISTAN\'S RIGHT TO CONDUCT A </p><p>NUCLEAR TEST, WHILE CALLING UPON IT TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT. </p><p>MEANWHILE, THE LEADER OF THE PML/N\'S COALITION PARTNER, THE SHIIA </p><p>TEHRIK-E-JAFRIA PAKISTAN (TJP), ALLAMA SAJJID ALI NAQVI, HAS URGED </p><p>NAWAZ TO REJECT AMERICAN HELP AND TO GO AHEAD WITH A NUCLEAR TEST. </p><p>IN A REPORT APPEARING IN THE MAY 23 ISSUE OF "THE MUSLIM," NAQVI IS </p><p>SAID TO BELIEVE THAT PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT MOVE TOWARD THE U.S. AS </p><p>THIS COULD ENDANGER ITS RELATIONS WITH ITS "TRADITIONAL ALLIES IRAN </p><p>AND CHINA." </p><p> </p><p>DIFFERENCES OVER TACTICS, NOT POLICY </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  BHUTTO\'S CRITICISMS OF THE SHARIF GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN </p><p>DIRECTED MORE AT ITS TACTICS IN DEALING WITH THE INDIAN THREAT THAN </p><p>AT ITS POLICY.  HER PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE ECHOED BY BABAR IN HIS </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF MAY 26.  THE PPP\'S LINE APPEARS TO BE THAT </p><p>IF BENAZIR HAD BEEN PRIME MINISTER, THE INDIANS WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>LESS LIKELY TO TEST NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.  (BABAR, </p><p>FOR INSTANCE, CREDITED BENAZIR\'S PREEMPTIVE DIPLOMACY IN 1995 WITH </p><p>HEADING OFF AN INDIAN TEST AT THAT TIME.)  SPEAKING AT THE MAY 24 </p><p>PAI MEETING IN LAHORE, BENAZIR SAID NAWAZ SHARIF\'S "GOOD MAN </p><p>GUJRAL" LINE LAST YEAR HAD BROUGHT PAKISTAN TO "THE BRINK OF </p><p>DISASTER."  ONCE INDIA DETONATED ITS BOMBS, BENAZIR (AND BABAR) </p><p>SAID SHARIF SHOULD HAVE TAKEN VIGOROUS ACTION TO LINE-UP </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN AND CONDEMNATION OF INDIA. </p><p>BABAR TOLD POLOFF THAT SHARIF HIMSELF SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CHINA </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INDIAN TESTS TO SEEK SUPPORT RATHER THAN </p><p>SENDING A "LOW-LEVEL" CAREER DIPLOMAT LIKE FOREIGN SECRETARY </p><p>SHAMSHAD AHMED.  SHARIF HAD ALSO FAILED TO RALLY THE MUSLIM WORLD </p><p>TO PAKISTAN\'S SIDE, BABAR SAID, AND HE CLAIMED THAT BENAZIR WOULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN FAR MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN NAWAZ IN WINNING WESTERN </p><p>SUPPORT.  MEANWHILE, BENAZIR IS CLAIMING CREDIT FOR PAKISTAN\'S </p><p>CAPABILITY OF READYING FOR A TEST IN TWO WEEKS; SHE SAID EARLIER </p><p>PAKISTAN HAD REQUIRED 30 DAYS TO READY FOR A TEST, BUT SHE HAD CUT </p><p>THAT BACK. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  SURPRISINGLY, NEITHER BABAR NOR BENAZIR HERSELF HAS WARNED </p><p>NAWAZ AGAINST POSSIBLE U.S. ATTEMPTS TO INDUCE RESTRAINT ON NUCLEAR </p><p>TESTING BY PROMISES OF AID.  THE ISLAMIC PARTIES AND MOST OF THE </p><p>MAJOR URDU AND ENGLISH-LANGUAGE NEWSPAPERS HAVE CAUTIONED NAWAZ TO </p><p>BEWARE OF AMERICAN BLANDISHMENTS.  BENAZIR AND THE PPP, HOWEVER, </p><p>SEEM WILLING TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE U.S. WILL DO IN RETURN FOR </p><p>PAKISTANI RESTRAINT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COMMENT:  POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM -- NOT CONCERNS FOR WHAT </p><p>IS BEST FOR PAKISTAN -- SEEMS TO BE THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE </p><p>OPPOSITION\'S UNRELENTING ATTACKS ON THE PRIME MINISTER.  THE </p><p>OPPOSITION HAS BEEN IN OVERDRIVE DEPICTING NAWAZ AS INDECISIVE AND </p><p>WEAK, GIVING HIM NO CREDIT FOR TAKING TIME TO WEIGH CAREFULLY THE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS OF PAKISTAN\'S CONDUCTING (OR NOT CONDUCTING) A NUCLEAR </p><p>TEST.  THE OPPOSITION\'S SUCCESS IN TURNING THE PUBLIC AGAINST </p><p>CONTINUED RESTRAINT REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION.  A JUST-RELEASED </p><p>GALLUP POLL, FOR EXAMPLE, REPORTS THAT OVER TWO-THIRDS OF </p><p>RESPONDENTS FAVORED A PAK NUCLEAR TEST, BUT "IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>FRIENDLY ADVICE" TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT, NEARLY 60 PERCENT OF </p><p>RESPONDENTS SAID THEY WOULD THEN FAVOR CONTINUED RESTRAINT.  77 </p><p>PERCENT WERE "SATISFIED" WITH HOW NAWAZ SHARIF HAS HANDLED THE </p><p>SITUATION.  (SEPTEL PROVIDES MORE DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE POLL.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIMONS </p><p></p></div>
