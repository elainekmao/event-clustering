<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002404 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LAGOS FOR ROBYN HINSON-JONES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/21/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ASEC, PTER, XA </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA SECURITY AND STABILITY ASSESSMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A)SECSTATE 162454 </p><p>     B. (B) ABUJA 2347 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Charge Tim Andrews for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: The likelihood of ethnic or religious unrest </p><p>in Nigeria in the wake of an eventual U.S. response to the </p><p>September 11 acts of terror is high.  Such unrest would not </p><p>necessarily be targeted at American individuals or </p><p>institutions, but American lives and property could be ar </p><p>risk.  Tensions here remain elevated following recent events </p><p>in Jos (Ref. B) and Wukari.  Demonstrations--either in favor </p><p>of or opposing U.S. military actions--could spark renewed </p><p>ethno-religious fighting, especially in the Middle Belt, but </p><p>potentially almost anywhere.  Major Muslim religious leaders </p><p>here have unequivocally condemned the attacks on the U.S. </p><p>However, many Muslims will be angered over any U.S. reprisal </p><p>attack that affects fellow Muslims. Some can be expected to </p><p>stage protests, as they did during the Gulf War and following </p><p>our reprisals for the Embassy bombings in 1998.  The GON is </p><p>willing to protect U.S. diplomats and installations in Abuja </p><p>and Lagos but is limited in its ability to do so.  Outside of </p><p>Abuja and the Lagos Islands, the GON\'s means of controlling </p><p>civil unrest are less robust.  Recently, the GON has managed </p><p>to quell unrest only with the assistance of the military, and </p><p>then after a substantial loss of life.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Nigeria, independent of events in the U.S., has just </p><p>suffered another paroxysm of ethno-religious conflict in Jos </p><p>(Ref. A).  There is always a potential for violent unrest in </p><p>Nigeria in those places where there exist longstanding ethnic </p><p>or religious conflicts.  In the past two years, Kaduna, Abia, </p><p>Lagos, Nassarawa, Bauchi, Taraba and now Plateau States have </p><p>witnessed civil unrest of varying degrees that has resulted </p><p>in a substantial number of deaths and sometimes provoked </p><p>reprisals elsewhere.  Many Nigerians and expatriates believe </p><p>that recent violence in Jos was exacerbated by the terror </p><p>attacks in the U.S.  Whether that assessment is accurate or </p><p>not is almost immaterial; the fact that it is so widely </p><p>believed creates a potential danger.  Protests about U.S. </p><p>reprisal attacks could spark a new round of fighting, there </p><p>or elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The most likely venues for large-scale protests in </p><p>the North would be Kano, Gusau, in Zamfara State and Kaduna </p><p>and Zaria in Kaduna State.  Protests could also materialize </p><p>in other places, including Jos, Suleja or Abuja.  We believe </p><p>Gon security forces would be able to contain any </p><p>demonstration within the parts of Abuja frequented by </p><p>official Americans.  The potential for civil unrest in </p><p>response to a U.S. reprisal is highest in Kano because it is </p><p>the largest predominantly Muslim city in the country, and is </p><p>home to local and transnational Muslim radicals who may try </p><p>to incite crowds to protest a USG military action.  After the </p><p>fuel-price demonstrations 15 months ago left several dead, </p><p>the Kano State Government, in conjunction with the Emir of </p><p>Kano, the National Police Force and the SSS, has worked </p><p>successfully to prevent large-scale demonstrations and their </p><p>associated violence.  It is unclear, however, that they would </p><p>be able to prevent, or to control, a spontaneous </p><p>demonstration in the Old City of Kano in response to U.S. </p><p>retaliation.  The Old City could easily produce a spontaneous </p><p>protest numbering in the tens of thousands.  USAID has an </p><p>office in Kano which has already been the subject of protests </p><p>by Muslims after a Johns Hopkins family planning program met </p><p>the disapproval of local Imams.  While this office is a good </p><p>distance from the Old City, it could again become the target </p><p>of protests, as it is the only institution identified with </p><p>the USG north of Abuja.  The British Council maintains a </p><p>large premises in the Old City of Kano, and that building </p><p>could be a target of protests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Gusau is a likely spot for anti-American protests, </p><p>but at present there is only one American there, a priest. </p><p>It is unlikely that the Zamfara state government would permit </p><p>a protest that would target the Catholic church in Gusau, </p><p>because Governor Sani does not want the public-relations </p><p>problems that would ensue.  However, political demonstrations </p><p>in Gusau have sometimes turned violent there because of </p><p>fierce political rivalries.  Zaria, the capital of Islamic </p><p>learning in Nigeria and home of the Nigerian Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood, would likely see some protests centered on </p><p>Ahmadu Bello University. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  While small protests in Sokoto are possible, there </p><p>are few Americans who might be targeted.  The Sultan of </p><p>Sokoto has publicly condemned the terrorist attack on several </p><p>occasions, and would likely work with Governor Bafarawa to </p><p>prevent any large-scale protests there.  While Kaduna could </p><p>have small demonstrations, it is not likely to see </p><p>large-scale protests, given its recent experience with </p><p>devastating mob-violence.  Seven local police stations have </p><p>been built in the hotspots in and around Kaduna and are </p><p>staffed with paramilitary Mobile Police, who would serve as a </p><p>strong deterrent to any major protests.  The recent violence </p><p>in Jos, the devastating loss of life there and the continued </p><p>presence of the military on the streets make it an unlikely </p><p>venue for protests.  Jos could re-ignite, however, if </p><p>fighting starts elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  The large, unplanned and often squalid urban </p><p>communities outside Abuja could see demonstrations by </p><p>Muslims.  Since Abuja, like Jos and Kaduna, has a large </p><p>population of Christians and Muslims, protests here by </p><p>Muslims could potentially spark off violence simmering </p><p>between the two groups over events in Jos and elsewhere. </p><p>There are several USG identified institutions in Abuja, </p><p>including the Embassy, USAID\'s offices and the American </p><p>School.  The USAID building, the Sheraton and the Hilton are </p><p>all within walking distance of the National Mosque, and could </p><p>see protests.  The police maintain a strong presence in </p><p>Abuja, and can be expected to protect U.S. diplomatic </p><p>institutions.  It is more likely that protests, and conflict, </p><p>would originate in the densely-populated outlying residential </p><p>districts, which have a collective population of over one </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  While Nigerians or transnationals could try to </p><p>attack U.S. installations or personnel in Nigeria, this has </p><p>not happened yet.  Short of a targeted attack, the greatest </p><p>danger to Mission personnel in Abuja and Lagos, and Amcits </p><p>generally, is crime and civil unrest.  We met with Amcits in </p><p>Kano and Abuja September 20 to discuss security issues, and </p><p>are planning to meet with or contact remaining Amcits in the </p><p>North and Middle Belt over the coming week. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
