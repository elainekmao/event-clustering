BRAYSHAW. </p><p>REASON:  1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) AT PRESENT, SAUDI ARABIA ENJOYS AT LEAST </p><p>SUPERFICIAL STABILITY.  THERE IS NO DEBILITATING </p><p>DISUNITY AMONG SENIOR AL SAUD PRINCES, REGIME CRITICS </p><p>HAVE BEEN EXILED OR MARGINALIZED ABROAD AND CO-OPTED </p><p>OR MUZZLED AT HOME, AND A LARGELY APOLITICAL CITIZENRY </p><p>SHOWS NO INCLINATION TO DEMAND GREATER PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN PUBLIC LIFE.  FACTORS SUCH AS THE HISTORICAL </p><p>CONTINUITY OF AL SAUD RULE, A LONG TRADITION OF </p><p>OBEDIENCE TO THE RULER AND A CORRESPONDING ABHORRENCE </p><p>OF DISORDER, AND A DEARTH OF POLITICAL ALTERNATIVES </p><p>BODE WELL FOR CONTINUED STABILITY AND REGIME SURVIVAL. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN THE INTERMEDIATE/LONGER-TERM, HOWEVER, THE </p><p>MAINTENANCE OF STABILITY WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON HOW </p><p>THE AL SAUD DEAL WITH A NUMBER OF FESTERING ECONOMIC, </p><p>POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS, AMONG THEM: A LOW- </p><p>GROWTH ECONOMY OVERLY DEPENDANT ON OIL; THE </p><p>EXPECTATIONS AND ASPIRATIONS OF AN EXPLODING YOUTH </p><p>POPULATION; AN EMERGING STRUGGLE BETWEEN A MINORITY OF </p><p>ISLAMIC CONSERVATIVES AND A MORE MODERATE MAJORITY </p><p>OVER THE KINGDOM\'S DIRECTION; AND LATENT REGIONAL AND </p><p>TRIBAL TENSIONS.  WHILE TOP LEVEL SAG LEADERS APPEAR </p><p>TO BE AWARE OF THESE CHALLENGES AND ARE MOVING IN THE </p><p>RIGHT DIRECTION TO CONFRONT THEM, IT REMAINS TO BE </p><p>SEEN WHETHER THEIR MEASURES WILL SUFFICE IN PACE AND </p><p>SCOPE.  OTHER SENIOR LEADERS ARE ENGAGED IN POLICIES </p><p>OR BEHAVIOR THAT COULD UNDERMINE STABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AT ALL TIMES, THE "WILD CARD" IN ANY ANALYSIS </p><p>OF SAUDI STABILITY IS ROYAL FAMILY DYNAMICS.  WHILE </p><p>THE CONTINUED REIGN OF 80 YEAR-OLD KING FAHD CASTS AN </p><p>OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF STABILITY AND CONTINUITY, IT IS </p><p>ACTUALLY A SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY AND POTENTIAL </p><p>INSTABILITY.  IN THE NEAR/INTERMEDIATE-TERM, THE </p><p>KINGDOM WILL LIKELY EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ONE ROYAL </p><p>SUCCESSION, THE RESULTS OF WHICH COULD THREATEN THE </p><p>INDISPENSABLE ELEMENT OF AL SAUD VIABILITY: ROYAL </p><p>FAMILY UNITY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROYAL DYNAMICS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) LARGELY INCAPACITATED AND A SHADOW OF HIS </p><p>FORMER SELF, KING FAHD - AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, FAHD\'S </p><p>SONS AND COURT SYCOPHANTS - HAVE NO APPARENT INTEREST </p><p>IN HIS ABDICATION.  FAHD\'S STUBBORN GRASP OF THE </p><p>RULING SCEPTER (AND, INDEED, OF LIFE ITSELF) IS </p><p>IMPEDING THE TRANSITION PROCESS AND MAY HAVE NEGATIVE </p><p>FUTURE CONSEQUENCES FOR AL SAUD RULE.  (A SAUDI JOKE </p><p>HAS IT THAT FAHD IS CALLED "THE CONQUEROR OF DEATH" </p><p>BECAUSE THE ANGEL OF DEATH FEARS TO APPROACH HIM.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN A NARROW SENSE, FAHD\'S CONTINUED PRESENCE </p><p>ON THE THRONE DEPRIVES CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH OF THE </p><p>FULL AUTHORITY OF A SAUDI MONARCH, THUS INHIBITING HIS </p><p>ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS.  AMONG SENIOR SONS OF </p><p>THE LATE KING ABD AL-AZIZ, ABDULLAH IS PROBABLY THE </p><p>BEST QUALIFIED TO LEAD THE KINGDOM THROUGH CHANGING </p><p>TIMES.  HE POSSESSES GREATER POPULAR CREDIBILITY AND A </p><p>MORE PROGRESSIVE, PRAGMATIC OUTLOOK THAN POWERFUL </p><p>HALF-BROTHERS DEFENSE MINISTER SULTAN OR INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER NAIF.  EVEN IF HE WERE KING, HOWEVER, </p><p>ABDULLAH WOULD BE OBLIGED TO SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY </p><p>DEVELOP CONSENSUS FOR HIS MODEST REFORM INITIATIVES: </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES ONLY INCREASE HIS </p><p>BURDEN OF CONSENSUS-BUILDING. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN A BROADER SENSE, THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF </p><p>THE 80 YEAR-OLD KING FAHD ADDS AN ELEMENT OF </p><p>UNCERTAINTY INTO THE SUCCESSION PROCESS AND MAY HINDER </p><p>A SMOOTH TRANSITION AFTER HIS EVENTUAL PASSING.  AFTER </p><p>ALL, 78 YEAR-OLD ABDULLAH AND 77 YEAR-OLD SULTAN (THE </p><p>APPARENT THIRD IN LINE) ARE ONLY SLIGHTLY YOUNGER THAN </p><p>FAHD AND BOTH SUFFER FROM AILMENTS COMMON TO </p><p>SEPTUAGENARIANS LONG-ACCUSTOMED TO A SEDENTARY, </p><p>LUXURIOUS LIFESTYLE (ABDULLAH ALSO WORKS LONG HOURS </p><p>AND LABORS UNDER CONSIDERABLE STRESS).  IT IS POSSIBLE </p><p>THAT FAHD COULD REMAIN IN PLACE RIGHT THROUGH THEIR </p><p>REMAINING PRIME WORKING YEARS AND POSSIBLY EVEN </p><p>OUTLIVE ONE OR BOTH.  SHOULD FAHD SURVIVE ABDULLAH, HE </p><p>WOULD HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT UNDER THE 1992 BASIC </p><p>LAW TO APPOINT A NEW CROWN PRINCE, AND FAHD\'S SONS </p><p>WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A MAJOR ROLE IN THE DECISION- </p><p>MAKING PROCESS.  WHILE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT </p><p>FAHD WOULD LIKELY TAP ONE OF HIS FULL "SUDAYRI SEVEN" </p><p>BROTHERS (SULTAN, DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER ABD AL- </p><p>RAHMAN, NAIF AND RIYADH GOVERNOR SALMAN, IN ORDER OF </p><p>SENIORITY), IT IS AT LEAST REMOTELY POSSIBLE THAT HE </p><p>COULD APPOINT ONE OF HIS SONS, PERHAPS HIS YOUNGEST </p><p>SON, 28 YEAR-OLD ABD AL-AZIZ BIN FAHD, CURRENT </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE, AS CROWN PRINCE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) TO A LARGE EXTENT, THE AL SAUD ARE MASTERS OF </p><p>THEIR OWN RULING DESTINY AND ARE PROBABLY MOST </p><p>VULNERABLE TO SELF-INFLICTED THREATS: THE </p><p>DISINTEGRATION OF UNITY AMONG SENIOR ROYAL FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS; CONDUCT BY THE KING OR SENIOR PRINCES WHICH </p><p>IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS UN-ISLAMIC; AND PERCEIVED </p><p>EGREGIOUS ROYAL CORRUPTION AND/OR NEGLECT OF THE </p><p>PUBLIC WEAL, PARTICULARLY IF ECONOMIC TIMES ARE </p><p>DIFFICULT.  THESE VULNERABILITIES ARE LOW UNDER </p><p>CURRENT CONDITIONS AND IN THE CASE OF AN ABDULLAH </p><p>KINGSHIP.  CREDIBLE RUMORS OF CORRUPT PRACTICES, </p><p>HOWEVER, HAVE LONG SWIRLED ABOUT DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>SULTAN AND HIS ELDEST SON KHALID, THUS INCREASING THE </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR INSTABILITY DURING A POSSIBLE SULTAN </p><p>REIGN.  ALL THREE VULNERABILITIES COULD BE EXPOSED IF </p><p>FAHD WERE TO TRY TO PLACE ONE OF HIS OWN SONS ON THE </p><p>THRONE, NONE OF WHOM POSSESS RESPECT EITHER WITHIN THE </p><p>ROYAL FAMILY OR AMONG THE PUBLIC.  THIS IS </p><p>PARTICULARLY TRUE OF ABD AL-AZIZ, WHO IS WIDELY </p><p>CONSIDERED TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ROYAL BARREL IN </p><p>TERMS OF PERSONAL PROBITY AND DECORUM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE ISLAMIC POLITY AND LACK OF INSTITUTIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) AS ONE OF THE TWO BEDROCK COMPONENTS OF THE </p><p>SAUDI RULING CONTRACT, THE AL SAUD ACQUIRED LEGITIMACY </p><p>IN EXCHANGE FOR ENFORCEMENT OF SHARI\'A LEGAL/SOCIAL </p><p>STRICTURES, CUSTODIANSHIP OF ISLAM\'S HOLIEST SHRINES, </p><p>AND ALLOWING THE ISLAMIC ESTABLISHMENT TO DEFINE </p><p>SOCIAL MORES AND CONTROL SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS.  REGIME ACCOMMODATION OF THE VIEWS OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES HAS PROVEN TO BE A RELATIVELY </p><p>LOW-COST PROPOSITION, AND SOME BELIEVE THAT THE SAG </p><p>CYNICALLY ALLOWS THE ISLAMIC ESTABLISHMENT TO DIVERT </p><p>PUBLIC ATTENTION TO RELATIVELY TRIFLING MATTERS (E.G. </p><p>THE ALLEGED ANTI-ISLAMIC NATURE OF POKEMON PRODUCTS, </p><p>THE APPROPRIATE SPECIFICATIONS FOR WOMEN\'S ABAYAS, </p><p>ETC.) LEST IT FOCUS ON VITALLY IMPORTANT TOPICS SUCH </p><p>AS THE REGIME\'S ABILITY TO DELIVER JOBS OR EVEN </p><p>ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF POTABLE WATER IN THE FUTURE. </p><p>HOWEVER, THIS APPARENT BENEFIT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE </p><p>RANKS OF GRADUATING YOUTH WITH NOTHING BUT RELIGIOUS </p><p>TRAINING WHO ARE ILL-PREPARED TO CONTRIBUTE TO A </p><p>MODERNIZING ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) STILL, THE AL SAUD, MOST OF WHOM PURSUE A MORE </p><p>LIBERAL, EVEN DISSOLUTE, LIFESTYLE IN PRIVATE, CAN ILL </p><p>AFFORD TO BE PERCEIVED AS LESS DEVOUT OR ZEALOUS THAN </p><p>THEIR HAND-PICKED ISLAMIC LEADERS AND SCHOLARS: THUS, </p><p>WE SEE LITTLE NEAR OR INTERMEDIATE TERM SAG MOVEMENT </p><p>ON SOCIAL ISSUES WHICH CARRY SIGNIFICANT EMOTIONAL </p><p>BAGGAGE SUCH AS WOMEN\'S RIGHTS.  THE AL SAUD\'S </p><p>INDULGENCE OF THE RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT ALSO </p><p>CONTRIBUTES TO THE SLOW PACE OF ECONOMIC REFORM, SINCE </p><p>THE \'ULAMA OPPOSE OPENING THE SAUDI ECONOMY, FEARING </p><p>THAT IT WILL LEAD TO GREATER FOREIGN, PARTICULARLY </p><p>WESTERN, INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE SEEDS OF FRICTION WITHIN SAUDI SOCIETY ARE </p><p>GROUNDED IN CONFLICTING VIEWS ABOUT THE KINGDOM\'S </p><p>MORAL DIRECTION IN GENERAL, AND THE PERVASIVE SPREAD </p><p>OF WESTERN (PRIMARILY AMERICAN) CULTURE AND WHAT SOME </p><p>SAUDIS PERCEIVE AS THE CONCOMITANT EROSION OF ISLAMIC </p><p>AND TRADITIONAL ARABIAN VALUES IN PARTICULAR.  SOME </p><p>SAUDI CONTACTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING </p><p>EFFORT BY A VOCAL, INFLUENTIAL, AND HIGHLY-MOTIVATED </p><p>RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE MINORITY TO PLACE LIKE-MINDED </p><p>PEOPLE IN AS MANY POSITIONS OF DAY-TO-DAY </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE, EDUCATIONAL, AND SOCIAL AUTHORITY AS </p><p>POSSIBLE BEFORE A RELATIVELY MODERATE (BUT SILENT) </p><p>MAJORITY GAINS ASCENDANCY.  IF THIS IS INDEED THE </p><p>CASE, A SITUATION SOMEWHAT AKIN TO THE PRESENT </p><p>ENVIRONMENT IN IRAN COULD DEVELOP, WHERE A RELATIVELY </p><p>MODERATE AND LARGELY YOUTHFUL MAJORITY STRUGGLES WITH </p><p>AN ENTRENCHED CONSERVATIVE MINORITY FOR CONTROL OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S DIRECTION. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) ALTHOUGH THE KINGDOM\'S INCREASING URBANIZATION </p><p>(ACCORDING TO WORLD BANK STATISTICS, 85 PERCENT OF </p><p>SAUDIS LIVE IN TOWNS OR CITIES AND THE PERCENTAGE IS </p><p>GROWING) HAS SOMEWHAT DIMINISHED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>TRIBAL IDENTITY, IT REMAINS A POWERFUL FACTOR IN SAUDI </p><p>SOCIETY, AND INTER-TRIBAL FRICTION COULD BECOME A </p><p>SOURCE OF FUTURE INSTABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF </p><p>ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.  A POTENTIALLY GREATER SOURCE OF </p><p>INSTABILITY IS REGIONAL IDENTITY AND A WIDESPREAD </p><p>PERCEPTION THAT THE LEAST PRODUCTIVE AND ECONOMICALLY- </p><p>VIABLE AREA OF THE KINGDOM, THE ARID AND CENTRAL </p><p>NEJD/QASSIM REGION (HOME OF THE AL SAUD, SUCKS UP THE </p><p>OIL WEALTH OF THE EASTERN REGION AND THE TRADING </p><p>WEALTH OF THE WESTERN HIJAZ REGION.  IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF NAJRAN, JIZAN, AND ASIR, SEIZED </p><p>FROM YEMEN IN THE EARLY 1930\'S, HAVE NEVER BEEN </p><p>EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED INTO THE SAUDI MAINSTREAM, </p><p>EITHER ECONOMICALLY OR CULTURALLY.  AGAIN, THE TREND </p><p>OF STEADILY DECLINING LIVING STANDARDS HAS THE </p><p>POTENTIAL TO FUEL LATENT REGIONAL RESENTMENTS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IF SAG LEADERS CONTINUE TO FUNNEL </p><p>INCREASINGLY SCARCE RESOURCES DISPROPORTIONATELY TO </p><p>THE NEJD. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THE AL SAUD HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ESTABLISH </p><p>INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE SHURA COUNCIL WHICH HOLD THE </p><p>POTENTIAL TO ALLOW GREATER PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>GOVERNANCE.  AT PRESENT, HOWEVER, SUCH INSTITUTIONS </p><p>HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT VOICE IN SAUDI PUBLIC LIFE.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THERE IS NO "CIVIL SOCIETY" AS THE CONCEPT </p><p>IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD.  COBBLED TOGETHER FROM </p><p>DISPARATE TRIBES AND INFLUENTIAL CLANS 80 YEARS AGO, </p><p>SAUDI SOCIETY IS MADE UP OF A PATCHWORK OF REGIONAL </p><p>AND TRIBAL INTERESTS HELD TOGETHER BY THE POWER OF THE </p><p>AL SAUD, AND THE MODERNIZING ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE LAST </p><p>FIFTY YEARS, AND LITTLE ELSE.  PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES, </p><p>LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, AND INTEREST GROUPS ARE GENERALLY </p><p>EITHER CREATED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR BANNED COMPLETELY. </p><p>WHILE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY DETECT A GROUNDSWELL OF </p><p>INTEREST IN POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AMONG THE MOSTLY </p><p>APOLITICAL SAUDI PUBLIC, FACTORS SUCH AS A NEW-FOUND </p><p>AVAILABILITY OF OUTSIDE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND </p><p>COMMUNICATION COULD CHANGE THIS, PARTICULARLY IF </p><p>COMBINED WITH AN ECONOMIC DECLINE AND ATTENDANT </p><p>FRUSTRATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE DEMOGRAPHIC TIME BOMB </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  THE AL SAUD\'S PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE KINGDOM\'S WEALTH IN RETURN </p><p>FOR THE CITIZENRY\'S OBEDIENCE IS THE OTHER COMPONENT </p><p>OF THE SAUDI RULING CONTRACT.  THIS DISTRIBUTION IS </p><p>FACILITATED BY THE CONCENTRATION OF THE ECONOMY IN THE </p><p>PETROLEUM SECTOR.  HOWEVER, AS CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH </p><p>FAMOUSLY WARNED TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO, THE EASY </p><p>YEARS HAVE PASSED. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) THE MOTIVATION FOR THE SAG\'S ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p>EFFORT IS CLEAR.  WITH A POPULATION GROWTH RATE OF </p><p>CLOSE TO 4% DURING MUCH OF THE LAST 20 YEARS AND OVER </p><p>HALF THE SAUDI POPULATION UNDER THE AGE OF 18, SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA IS FACING A DEMOGRAPHIC TIME BOMB.  (THE SAG </p><p>ESTIMATES THAT THE RATE OF POPULATION GROWTH HAS </p><p>RECENTLY DROPPED TO AROUND 3%.)  UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES </p><p>FOR WORKING AGE SAUDI MALES RANGE FROM THE OFFICIAL </p><p>RATE OF 14% TO A SAUDI NEWSPAPER COMMENTATOR\'S </p><p>ESTIMATE OF 46%.  IN ANY CASE, NEITHER WOMEN NOR </p><p>UNDEREMPLOYMENT ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE VOLATILITY OF OIL PRICES, THE OIL AND </p><p>PETROCHEMICAL SECTORS EXPERIENCE WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN </p><p>GROWTH AND ARE HEAVILY CAPITAL INTENSIVE.  THUS, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS PINNED ITS HOPES ON THE NON-OIL, </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR THE 100,000 SAUDI </p><p>MALE JOB SEEKERS (MANY WITHOUT POST SECONDARY </p><p>EDUCATION) ENTERING THE LABOR MARKET EVERY YEAR. </p><p>(CURRENTLY, ONLY ABOUT 50,000 NEW EMPLOYEES PER YEAR </p><p>ARE HIRED, ALMOST ALL BY THE SAG.)  THE CROWN PRINCE </p><p>RECOGNIZES THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO </p><p>ACT AS EMPLOYER OF LAST RESORT OR PROVIDE FREE MEDICAL </p><p>CARE AND EDUCATION TO ALL SAUDIS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT\'S PURPOSE OVER THE PAST THREE </p><p>YEARS IN SEEKING TO MODERNIZE THE ECONOMY BY REVISING </p><p>MOST OF THE BASIC ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL LAWS, </p><p>ACCELERATING EFFORTS TO JOIN THE WORLD TRADE </p><p>ORGANIZATION, AND OFFERING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL OIL </p><p>COMPANIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN THE GAS SECTOR </p><p>IS ALSO CLEAR -- TO SPUR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  THE EXPECTATION IS THAT AN OPEN, LIBERAL </p><p>ECONOMY WILL ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND, EVEN MORE </p><p>IMPORTANT, BRING SAUDI OVERSEAS CAPITAL (ESTIMATED AT </p><p>BETWEEN $600-800 BILLION) HOME.  (NOTE: AS A POINT OF </p><p>REFERENCE, 2000 SAUDI GDP WAS USD 173 BILLION.)  THE </p><p>SAUDIS HOPE THIS WILL GENERATE PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH </p><p>AND CREATE JOBS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SO LITTLE, SO LATE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) THE PACE OF REFORM IN SAUDI ARABIA IS SLOW </p><p>AND THE RESULTS IN TERMS OF NEW INVESTMENT AND JOB </p><p>CREATION EVEN SLOWER TO MATERIALIZE.  THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE\'S GAS INITIATIVE, LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 1998, </p><p>IS MOVING FORWARD PRETTY MUCH ON SCHEDULE, BUT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL OIL COMPANIES ARE NOT </p><p>EXPECTED TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THE COMMERCIAL TERMS OF </p><p>THE PROJECTS UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT </p><p>YEAR.  WITH ARAMCO\'S PROVEN GAS RESERVES OFF LIMITS, </p><p>THE OIL COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO FIND GAS TO RUN THE </p><p>DESALINATION AND POWER PLANTS THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO </p><p>BUILD.  THE THREE CONSORTIA OF INTERNATIONAL OIL </p><p>COMPANIES THAT WERE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GAS </p><p>INITIATIVE ARE EXPECTED TO INVEST $25 BILLION DOLLARS </p><p>OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD.  MUCH OF THAT INVESTMENT MAY </p><p>BE DELAYED UNTIL THE INVESTORS FIND AND DEVELOP THAT </p><p>GAS.  SAUDI ARABIA IS UNLIKELY TO SEE ANY OF THAT </p><p>MONEY UNTIL SOMETIME NEXT YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) THE PROCESS OF OVERHAULING SAUDI ARABIA\'S </p><p>LAWS IS A DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. </p><p>PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE -- A NEW FOREIGN DIRECT </p><p>INVESTMENT LAW WAS ADOPTED, THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR WAS </p><p>RESTRUCTURED, A PRIVATIZATION STRATEGY WAS ADOPTED, </p><p>TOURIST VISAS ARE BEING GRANTED, FOREIGN INVESTORS CAN </p><p>INVEST IN THE SAUDI STOCK MARKET THROUGH MUTUAL FUNDS </p><p>MANAGED BY LOCAL BANKS, TARIFFS ON MOST IMPORTS WERE </p><p>CUT TO 5%, AND NEW REGULATIONS FOR THE </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR WERE ADOPTED.  MUCH MORE </p><p>REMAINS TO BE DONE -- NEW LAWS COVERING CAPITAL </p><p>MARKETS, TAXES, COMPANY LAW, AGENCY LAW, LABOR </p><p>RELATIONS, AND IPR ARE ALL UNDER PREPARATION.  WE ARE </p><p>FINDING, HOWEVER, THAT EVEN WHEN A NEW POLICY OR LAW </p><p>IS ADOPTED, THE IMPLEMENTATION MAY NOT LIVE UP TO </p><p>EXPECTATIONS.  THE NEW FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT LAW </p><p>HAS NOT RENDERED THE INVESTMENT PROCESS APPRECIABLY </p><p>MORE TRANSPARENT OR INVESTOR FRIENDLY.  HOPES WERE </p><p>HIGH FOR PRIVATIZATION AS A PATH TO ECONOMIC REFORM A </p><p>YEAR AGO, BUT ANY POSSIBILITIES OF PRIVATIZATION </p><p>(E.G., THE SAUDI TELECOM COMPANY OR SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>AIRLINES) ARE YEARS AWAY. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) THE MOMENTUM FOR WTO ACCESSION APPEARS TO BE </p><p>FLAGGING.  ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE CROWN PRINCE\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO GAINING WTO MEMBERSHIP REMAINS FIRM, THE </p><p>DIFFICULTY OF MOVING LEGISLATION AND THE NECESSARY </p><p>IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS THROUGH THE SYSTEM HAS SLOWED </p><p>THINGS TO A CRAWL.  THE CROWN PRINCE\'S APPOINTMENT OF </p><p>PRINCE NAIF TO OVERSEE ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS DOES NOT </p><p>APPEAR TO HAVE GALVANIZED THE BUREAUCRACY.  THE ONLY </p><p>MAJOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>MINISTERS SINCE THE LAST WTO ACCESSION WORKING PARTY </p><p>MEETING IN OCTOBER 2000 WAS THE NEW TELECOM </p><p>REGULATIONS APPROVED IN MAY.  KEY LAWS AND REGULATIONS </p><p>DESIGNED TO BRING THE SAUDI TRADE AND INVESTMENT </p><p>REGIME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH WTO STANDARDS ARE MONTHS </p><p>AWAY FROM COMPLETION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IS IT ENOUGH? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) SAUDI ARABIA SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR ITS GOOD </p><p>INTENTIONS.  BUT SHOULD SAUDI ARABIA BECOME A WTO </p><p>MEMBER AND IMPLEMENT THE BULK OF THE REFORM PROGRAM AS </p><p>CURRENTLY ENVISAGED, IT WOULD STILL FACE SERIOUS </p><p>ECONOMIC CHALLENGES.  IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE PACE </p><p>AND SCOPE OF REFORMS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT </p><p>SIGNIFICANT SAUDI OR FOREIGN INVESTMENT INTO THE NON- </p><p>OIL PRIVATE SECTOR AND GENERATE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH </p><p>NEEDED TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT.  THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES THESE REFORMS AND WTO </p><p>MEMBERSHIP DO NOT AND WILL NOT ADDRESS.  THESE INCLUDE </p><p>THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OIL REVENUES THAT NEVER MAKE </p><p>IT TO THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE FOR INCLUSION IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT BUDGET; THE LACK OF A MODERN, LEGAL </p><p>FRAMEWORK FOR SETTLING COMMERCIAL DISPUTES; THE LACK </p><p>OF A SAUDI INCOME TAX (PERSONAL OR CORPORATE) TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE GOVERNMENT WITH A MORE STABLE REVENUE </p><p>BASE; THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY OF REQUIRING BUSINESSES </p><p>TO HIRE SAUDIS WHO, IN MANY CASES, LACK SKILLS AND </p><p>MOTIVATION; FEAR OF ARBITRARY, CONFISCATORY ACTIONS BY </p><p>THE ROYAL FAMILY; AND CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROCUREMENT.  ALL THESE FACTORS DRIVE WEALTHY SAUDIS </p><p>TO INVEST OVERSEAS LIMITING THE NUMBER OF FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTORS WHO ARE WILLING TO PUT MONEY INTO SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) THE AL SAUD\'S ABILITY TO FULFILL THE </p><p>EXPECTATIONS OF THE KINGDOM\'S GROWING YOUTH POPULATION </p><p>WILL BE A KEY FACTOR IN OVERALL STABILITY.  THE PUSH </p><p>TO EMPLOY SAUDIS IN PLACE OF THE SEVEN MILLION FOREIGN </p><p>WORKERS MAY HELP, IN SPITE OF THE LACK OF BASIC </p><p>QUALIFICATIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT WHICH PERVADES THE </p><p>YOUNGER GENERATION.  WITH FALTERING AND UNEVEN PUBLIC </p><p>SUPPORT FOR WTO ACCESSION AND ECONOMIC REFORMS AND THE </p><p>STILLBORN PROGRAM TO PROVIDE VOCATIONAL TRAINING, THE </p><p>AL SAUD FAMILY FACES MAJOR CHALLENGES IN DELIVERING ON </p><p>THE ECONOMIC PART OF THE RULING BARGAIN, WHICH IN TURN </p><p>COULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON STABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) STILL, ALL BUT A DWINDLING NUMBER OF ELDERLY </p><p>SAUDIS HAVE KNOWN NOTHING BUT AL SAUD RULE, AND IT IS </p><p>PROBABLY DIFFICULT FOR MOST SAUDIS TO IMAGINE LIFE </p><p>WITHOUT AN AL SAUD FAMILY MEMBER ON THE THRONE. </p><p>BARRING FALLOUT OVER SUCCESSION SURPRISES OR A </p><p>CATASTROPHIC REGIONAL POLITICAL UPHEAVAL, THE ROYAL </p><p>FAMILY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF </p><p>THE KINGDOM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>FACED WITH A SITUATION WHERE THEY MUST GRANT MORE </p><p>FREEDOM TO FOSTER PROGRESS, BOTH ECONOMIC AND </p><p>SOCIETAL, THE AL SAUD RUN THE RISK THAT THIS SAME </p><p>FREEDOM WILL UNDERMINE THEIR MUCH-CHERISHED DISCIPLINE </p><p>AND CONFORMITY.  THE AL SAUD\'S ABILITY TO ADAPT TO </p><p>CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST AS THE </p><p>FRUITS OF RAPID POPULATION GROWTH, POOR ECONOMIC </p><p>PERFORMANCE, AND CODDLING OF THE ISLAMIC ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>BECOME EVER APPARENT. </p><p> </p><p>22. (U) THIS CABLE FULFILLS A REQUIREMENT OF POST\'S </p><p>REPORTING PLAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRAYSHAW </p><p></p></div>
