<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000787 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/28/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EFIN, ECPS, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: WEEKLY NEWS REVIEW #2 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is the second edition of what will be a weekly </p><p>roundup of significant developments in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>BENUE COMMISSION OF INQUIRY FINALLY ESTABLISHED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On March 6 President Obasanjo inaugurated a 10-person </p><p>Judicial Commission of Inquiry to review communal violence in </p><p>Benue, Nassarawa, Plateau and Taraba states.  The Commission </p><p>will be chaired by Justice Okechukwe Opene, and includes </p><p>Alhaji Mohammed Liman, Micleans Dikwal, Daniel Agogo, Alhaji </p><p>Haruna Ahmadu, Ambassador Yahaya Abdullahi, Alhaji Yahaya </p><p>Hamza, Chief Patrick Okon, Ruth Akafa and Dr. Sani Suji.  As </p><p>part of its mandate, the commission will investigate the </p><p>October 2001 execution of 19 soldiers by Tiv militiamen and </p><p>the reprisal attacks by angered soldiers that killed over 200 </p><p>Tiv villagers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) According to media reports, the committee\'s terms of </p><p>reference are: 1) Examine the proximate causes of the </p><p>conflicts; 2) Identifying the basic issues underlying tension </p><p>between communities and providing strategies for peace; 3) </p><p>Identify groups and individuals involved in the crises; 4) </p><p>Recommend appropriate sanctions; 5) Examine the roles of </p><p>states and local governments and traditional authorities; 6) </p><p>Provide recommendations to improve existing security </p><p>arrangements; and 7) Provide recommendations on other </p><p>measures to secure peace and facilitate reconciliation </p><p>between communities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>NITEL Privatization Rocky </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) This is the third week of a six-week extension </p><p>provided International Investors Limited (IIL), the winning </p><p>bidder for 51 percent shares of NITEL.  The extension was </p><p>granted to give IIL time to raise the USD 1.3 billion due to </p><p>complete the bid.  However, IIL seems no closer to finding </p><p>the needed capital.  Observers speculate that the extension </p><p>was granted not so much for IIL but to give GON time to </p><p>figure out an alternate course given the possibility of IIL </p><p>falling on its face. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) IIL may be forced to drop its NITEL bid, despite the </p><p>non-refundable USD 132 million paid to Bureau of Public </p><p>Enterprise (BPE), because the financial markets lack stomach </p><p>for the deal and will not provide the cash.  If IIL fails to </p><p>raise the funds by March 26, the consortium must be </p><p>disqualified and the sale reopened to the alternate bidders. </p><p>The second bidder Telnet, which offered only USD 7 million </p><p>less than IIL, has lost interest in the deal.  However, the </p><p>third bidder Newtel, at USD 1.017 billion, has expressed </p><p>continued interest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>IMF Mission Concludes No Formal Program Possible </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The IMF mission to Nigeria departed March 7 after </p><p>concluding that Nigeria\'s macroeconomy faced too many </p><p>uncertainties to establish a formal IMF program at this time. </p><p> Despite fourth quarter 2001 progress reducing GON spending, </p><p>slowing money supply growth, stabilizing inflation and </p><p>raising petroleum prices, agreed targets in the informal </p><p>program were not met.  In the absence of a finalized 2002 </p><p>budget and the lack of political commitment to hold spending </p><p>below 2001 levels, the IMF and GON concluded that an IMF </p><p>program in 2002 was unsustainable.  The IMF, however, will </p><p>retain staff in Nigeria and will provide technical assistance </p><p>and capacity-building, as the GON requests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The GON wanted an IMF program but one with much less </p><p>belt tightening.  Trying to turn this economic failure into </p><p>political victory, the GON publicized "its decision" to </p><p>forego an IMF program before the IMF itself could announce </p><p>that Nigeria had failed to conclude an agreement. </p><p>Administration critics have complained that Obasanjo has been </p><p>too eager to follow IMF\'s strictures and has been too </p><p>insensitive to the hardship imposed on the average Nigerian </p><p>by IMF economic remedies.  By ending the formal tie with the </p><p>IMF, Obasanjo hopes to strike a populist chord and pick up </p><p>some electoral support because he stood up to the IMF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>POLICE CHIEF FIRED/ POLICE STRIKE STILL ON? </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.   (U) Ineffectual Police Inspector General Musilu Smith </p><p>was sacked on March 7. Smith had been in trouble after </p><p>incorrectly telling the President that the Police would not </p><p>strike in January over their salary and allowance arrearages. </p><p>The January strike ended only after Government jailed its </p><p>leaders while promising to pay the arrearages. However, the </p><p>money has not been dispersed and many officers feel they have </p><p>been duped. Strike threats have resurfaced with March 11 seen </p><p>as a possible strike date. Our Police sources say that Police </p><p>support for a renewed strike is divided. Roughly half the </p><p>officers are sympathetic to a strike but it is unclear how </p><p>many will actually answer the call. </p><p>8.  (C) Comment: To a certain degree, Smith has been  made a </p><p>scapegoat.  The allowance arrears are not entirely his fault. </p><p> Nonetheless, the Administration probably reasoned that </p><p>jettisoning Smith now would douse support for a strike. Since </p><p>Smith lacked a political base and because his generally </p><p>lackluster performance made him expendable, the decision to </p><p>remove him was inevitable. End comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
