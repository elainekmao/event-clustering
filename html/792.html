<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L PHNOM PENH 003699 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  11/06/05 </p><p>TAGS:  MCAP, PGOV, PINS, CB </p><p>SUBJECT:  DEFENSE MINISTER GIVEN COMMAND CONTROL </p><p>OVER ARMED FORCES </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY ROBERT C. PORTER, DEPUTY CHIEF </p><p>OF MISSION, PHNOM PENH; REASON 1.5 (B). </p><p>DECLASSIFY NOVEMBER 6, 2005. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY.  THE RECENT APPOINTMENT OF THE </p><p>CO-DEFENSE MINISTERS AS DEPUTY COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF </p><p>PLACES THE MILITARY UNDER TIGHTER CIVILIAN </p><p>CONTROL, BUT HAS DISPLEASED CHIEF OF THE GENERAL </p><p>STAFF GEN. KY KIM YAN, WHO UNTIL NOW HAD BEEN ABLE </p><p>TO IGNORE THE DEFENSE MINISTERS WHEN IT SUITED HIS </p><p>PURPOSES.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER, CO-DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER GEN. TEA BANH, A STRONG SUPPORTER OF </p><p>SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN, HAS BEEN TAKING AN </p><p>INCREASINGLY ASSERTIVE ROLE VIS-A-VIS THE RCAF. </p><p>TO FOSTER UNITY AND COUNTER ANY BAD FEELINGS, </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT CHEA SIM INVITED </p><p>SENIOR RCAF, POLICE AND DEFENSE MINISTRY PERSONNEL </p><p>TO A "NATIONAL DAY" BASH TWO WEEKS BEFORE NATIONAL </p><p>DAY.  NONE OF OUR CONTACTS BELIEVES THAT KE KIM </p><p>YAN WILL ACT ON HIS UNHAPPINESS; WE AGREE WITH </p><p>THAT ASSESSMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SEVERAL RCAF CONTACTS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>THEN-ACTING CHIEF OF STATE CHEA SIM RECENTLY </p><p>APPROVED A PROPOSAL FROM THE TWO PRIME MINISTERS </p><p>APPOINTING THE CO-MINISTERS OF DEFENSE AS DEPUTY </p><p>COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF.  THE CHANGE, WHICH IN THEORY </p><p>WENT INTO EFFECT ON OCTOBER 11, PROVIDES THE </p><p>MINISTERS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO GIVE ORDERS TO </p><p>CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF KE KIM YAN, WHO FORMERLY </p><p>REPORTED DIRECTLY TO THE TWO PRIME MINISTERS IN </p><p>THEIR CAPACITY AS COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF.  THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTERS MADE THE CHANGE IN PART BECAUSE THEY </p><p>WANTED A CIVILIAN TO BE IN COMMAND OF THE MILITARY </p><p>WHEN THEY BOTH TRAVELED ABROAD (AS THEY RECENTLY </p><p>DID DURING THE UNGA). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) A VARIETY OF SENIOR CIVILIAN AND MILITARY </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD US THAT KE KIM YAN IS UNHAPPY </p><p>WITH THE CHANGE, IN PART BECAUSE HE DOES NOT GET </p><p>ALONG WELL WITH CO-DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL TEA </p><p>BANH (CPP).  MAKING MATTERS WORSE FOR KIM YAN, </p><p>ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACTS, TEA BANH HAS BECOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY ASSERTIVE IN DEALING WITH THE RCAF IN </p><p>RECENT WEEKS, APPARENTLY BECAUSE OF INCREASED </p><p>BACKING FROM SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN; </p><p>MEANWHILE, THE FUNCINPEC CO-DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>GENERAL TEA CHAMRATH HAS GONE INTO REPOSE.  KE KIM </p><p>YAN BELIEVES HE HAS BEEN PUT INTO A DIFFICULT </p><p>POSITION BECAUSE, IN THE PAST, HE WAS ABLE TO </p><p>STRADDLE SUCCESSFULLY THE FENCE BETWEEN THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE TWO MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WHEN CHEA SIM WAS MADE AWARE OF KE KIM </p><p>YAN\'S UNHAPPINESS, HE DECIDED IT WAS TIME FOR A </p><p>PARTY TO SOOTHE HARD FEELINGS AND FOSTER A SENSE </p><p>OF UNITY.  REACHING FOR AN OCCASION TO HONOR THE </p><p>ARMED FORCES, HE HELD A PREMATURE NATIONAL DAY </p><p>CELEBRATION MORE THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE REAL </p><p>EVENT AND INVITED THE TOP MILITARY, POLICE, AND </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTRY LEADERSHIP.  OVER 200 RCAF AND </p><p>POLICE GENERAL OFFICERS ATTENDED, INCLUDING KE KIM </p><p>YAN AND THE CO-MINISTERS OF DEFENSE AND INTERIOR. </p><p>IN HIS SPEECH, CHEA SIM REVIEWED PROGRESS TO DATE </p><p>IN UNIFYING AND RESTRUCTURING THE ARMED FORCES AND </p><p>POLICE AND URGED BOTH THE MILITARY AND POLICE TO </p><p>CONTINUE THEIR COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  THE MOVE IS A WELCOME CHANGE </p><p>BECAUSE IT PUTS THE MILITARY UNDER GREATER </p><p>CIVILIAN CONTROL AND WILL HELP IMPROVE </p><p>COORDINATION BETWEEN THE RCAF GENERAL STAFF AND </p><p>THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WHICH SOMETIMES HAS BEEN </p><p>LACKING.  NO ONE WITH WHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN BELIEVES </p><p>THAT KE KIM YAN WILL ACT ON HIS UNHAPPINESS IN A </p><p>WAY WHICH WOULD BE POLITICALLY OR OTHERWISE </p><p>DESTABILIZING.  WHAT IT MAY DO, HOWEVER, IS MOVE </p><p>HIM CLOSER TO CO-INTERIOR MINISTER SAR KHENG TO </p><p>WHOM HE HAS BEEN CLOSE PERSONALLY FOR SOME TIME. </p><p>IT IS CURIOUS THAT, THROUGH TEA BANH, PRIME </p><p>MINISTER HUN SEN WOULD TAKE ACTIONS WHICH WOULD </p><p>ALIENATE THE ARMY, FROM WHICH HE HAS FREQUENTLY </p><p>CLAIMED TO DERIVE CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT.  WE WILL </p><p>BE COMMENTING SEPTEL ON HUN SEN\'S INCREASING </p><p>RELIANCE ON THE MILITARY POLICE AND HIS INTEREST </p><p>IN CREATING A SPECIAL UNIT TO ACT AS HIS </p><p>BODYGUARDS. </p><p> </p><p>TWINING </p><p></p></div>
