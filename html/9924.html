<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 002221 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ISC (MCMANUS AND ERVITI), WHA/CAN </p><p>(RUNNING), OES/EGC (DEROSA) </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC -- OFFICE OF NAFTA </p><p> </p><p>DOE FOR IA (A/S BAILEY, DAS DOBRIANSKY, PUMPHREY, DEUTSCH </p><p>AND MARQUIS) AND EERE (DIXON) </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR MELLE AND CHANDLER </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS INTERIOR FOR INT\'L AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS FERC FOR MOSLEY, LONGENECKER, CONNORS, KELLY AND </p><p>LEKANG </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USNRC FOR COMMISSIONER MERRIFIELD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ETRD, CA, Energy </p><p>SUBJECT: NATURAL GAS VS. NUCLEAR:  CANADIANS STUDY FEASIBILITY </p><p>       OF REACTORS FUELLING OILSANDS </p><p> </p><p>REF: OTTAWA 1924 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY:  THE CANADIAN ENERGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE (CERI) </p><p>SAYS THAT, AT NATURAL GAS PRICES OF USD 3.50 / MCF OR MORE, </p><p>NUCLEAR REACTORS WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY SUPERIOR TO NATURAL </p><p>GAS IN SUPPLYING THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF STEAM REQUIRED TO </p><p>EXTRACT CRUDE OIL FROM CANADA\'S VAST OILSAND RESOURCES.  IF </p><p>THIS ANALYSIS IS CORRECT, AND IF POLITICAL CONDITIONS ALLOW </p><p>THE NUCLEAR OPTION, THIS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FREE UP </p><p>SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CANADA\'S NATURAL GAS FOR U.S. </p><p>MARKETS, WHILE FURTHER STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMICS OF </p><p>CANADA\'S SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   THE CERI STUDY IS AVAILABLE AT WEBSITE CERI.ORG.  WHILE </p><p>THE STUDY WAS SPONSORED BY ATOMIC ENERGY OF CANADA LIMITED </p><p>(AECL), WHICH IS THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATE TO SUPPLY REACTORS IN </p><p>CANADA, IN POST\'S OPINION CERI\'S ECONOMIC WORK IS CREDIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.   WESTERN CANADA\'S OILSANDS (REFTEL) CONTAIN PROVEN </p><p>RESERVES EQUIVALENT TO 175 BILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL, </p><p>WHICH ARE ALREADY ECONOMICALLY RECOVERABLE AT CURRENT OIL </p><p>PRICES.  EXTRACTING MOST OF THIS OIL DEMANDS LARGE AMOUNTS </p><p>OF STEAM, WHICH IS INJECTED INTO THE GROUND IN ORDER TO </p><p>SEPARATE OIL FROM SAND.  CURRENTLY, THIS STEAM IS SUPPLIED </p><p>BY BURNING NATURAL GAS - WHICH IS ABUNDANT IN THE OILSAND </p><p>REGION, BUT SUSCEPTIBLE TO TIGHTENING SUPPLY-DEMAND </p><p>CONDITIONS ON A CONTINENTAL BASIS.  POSSIBLE RISING NATURAL </p><p>GAS PRICES ARE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF ECONOMIC RISK FOR </p><p>OILSAND PRODUCERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   THE OILSANDS ARE CURRENTLY PRODUCING A MILLION BARRELS </p><p>OF OIL DAILY, AND MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR EXPANSIONS ARE </p><p>UNDERWAY, SO THE AMOUNT OF NATURAL GAS CONSUMED IS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT.  ANALYSTS SAY THAT GAS FROM THE PROPOSED </p><p>MACKENZIE VALLEY NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT, WHICH IS </p><p>PROJECTED TO DELIVER ROUGHLY 0.8-1.2 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF </p><p>GAS PER DAY TO NORTHERN ALBERTA BEGINNING AROUND 2009-2010, </p><p>IS LIKELY TO BE ENTIRELY ABSORBED BY OILSANDS DEMAND. </p><p> </p><p>5.   THE CERI STUDY COMPARES CURRENT GAS-FIRED STEAM </p><p>GENERATION TECHNOLOGY WITH THE ACR-700, THE COMING </p><p>GENERATION OF AECL\'S "CANDU" LIGHT WATER REACTORS.  THESE </p><p>REACTORS BURN NATURAL-GRADE URANIUM, OF WHICH CANADA IS THE </p><p>WORLD\'S LARGEST PRODUCER.  AECL HAS UP-TO-DATE EXPERIENCE </p><p>WITH REACTOR CONSTRUCTION; IT HAS CURRENT OR RECENT </p><p>CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN CHINA, KOREA AND ROMANIA, AND </p><p>COMPLETED CANADA\'S NEWEST NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AT DARLINGTON, </p><p>ONTARIO IN THE EARLY 1990\'S.  AECL ALSO CLAIMS A GOOD RECORD </p><p>OF COMPLETING REACTORS ON SCHEDULE AND ON BUDGET. </p><p> </p><p>6.   ACCORDING TO THE CERI STUDY, AT GAS COSTS OF USD 3.50 / </p><p>MCF, TOTAL COSTS FOR THE TWO OPTIONS ARE SIMILAR, WITH </p><p>NUCLEAR HAVING AN EDGE ($8.61 VS. $9.42 PER TONNE OF STEAM). </p><p>HOWEVER, THE STUDY STRESSES THAT BECAUSE FUEL ACCOUNTS FOR </p><p>ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE COST OF THE GAS OPTION, THIS OPTION </p><p>IS MUCH MORE EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN FUEL COST.  MOREOVER, THE </p><p>GAS OPTION IS ALSO EXPOSED TO POSSIBLE COSTS RELATED TO ITS </p><p>CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS, A FACTOR WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE </p><p>NUCLEAR OPTION. </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT:  THE FINDING THAT NUCLEAR IS AN ECONOMICALLY </p><p>COMPETITIVE SOURCE OF HEAT FOR OILSANDS PRODUCTION IS NO </p><p>SURPRISE.  CANDU REACTORS HAVE GOOD SERVICE RECORDS, AECL </p><p>HAS RECENT CONSTRUCTION EXPERIENCE, URANIUM IS ABUNDANT, AND </p><p>CANADA\'S NUCLEAR POWER REACTORS HAVE PROVIDED COMPETITIVE </p><p>BASE-LOAD ELECTRICITY FOR DECADES.  ALL THE QUESTIONS ARE ON </p><p>THE POLITICAL SIDE.  WESTERN CANADIANS CURRENTLY HAVE </p><p>VIRTUALLY NO EXPOSURE TO NUCLEAR INDUSTRIES OTHER THAN </p><p>URANIUM MINES, WHEREAS THEY KNOW AND TRUST FOSSIL FUELS. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
