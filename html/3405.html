<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002262 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 07/29/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LAGOS GOVERNOR SAYS OBASANJO NEEDS A </p><p>PDP-AD ALLIANCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: (C) During a July 5 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu </p><p>stated that President Obasanjo was in deep trouble </p><p>politically. Reelection hinged on a deal with Tinubu\'s </p><p>Alliance for Democracy (AD). However, Tinubu claimed </p><p>Obasanjo was still trying to assert PDP supremacy in </p><p>the Southwest and was hurting his position within the </p><p>PDP itself by allowing his relationship with VP Atiku </p><p>to drift. Regarding 2003 presidential and </p><p>gubernatorial races, Tinubu claimed the AD would hold </p><p>the Southwest while gaining strong support in populous </p><p>states like Kaduna, Plateau and Benue. Closer to home, </p><p>Tinubu felt he would win reelection handily.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO IN THE SOUTHWEST - A FIGHT TO AVOID </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Surveying the political landscape, Tinubu saw </p><p>Obasanjo wandering into a dense thicket yet failing to </p><p>appreciate the depth of his electoral troubles. For </p><p>example, the Governor declared Obasanjo was unpopular </p><p>in Lagos despite his Yoruba bloodlines. When the </p><p>President visited the city to deliver the University </p><p>of Lagos graduation address, Tinubu was in meetings </p><p>until after 4 a.m. to convince student leaders to </p><p>shelve a mass protest against Obasanjo. Tinubu </p><p>remembered the students were vitriolic; only his </p><p>appeal not to embarrass Lagos and the university </p><p>finally won the day. The student\'s dislike for the </p><p>President, he added, was echoed throughout Lagos. Few </p><p>people have a good word for Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Attributing Obasanjo\'s woes to his inability to </p><p>listen to independent advice and his lack of </p><p>interpersonal skills, Tinubu portrayed the President </p><p>as a myopic bull in a crowded china shop. Despite </p><p>Obasanjo\'s flaws as a politician and their memberships </p><p>in different parties, Tinubu said they remained </p><p>personal friends. Also, despite Obasanjo\'s ebbing </p><p>popularity, Tinubu acknowledged the AD had not shut </p><p>the door on cooperating with him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Before the AD could cooperate, Obasanjo would </p><p>have to call off the PDP dogs in Southwest. Tinubu </p><p>thought Obasanjo knew the Southwest was vital to his </p><p>reelection.  However, Obasanjo\'s personal pride was </p><p>obscuring the best tack for securing the region\'s </p><p>support. Instead, of attempting a frontal assault to </p><p>wrest the Southwest from the AD, Obasanjo should seek </p><p>an AD-PDP alliance.  Obasanjo\'s reliance on PDP </p><p>National Deputy Chairman for the Southwest Bode George </p><p>was unfortunate. George was telling Obasanjo the PDP </p><p>could win by playing hardball. Tinubu scoffed that </p><p>George was highly unpopular, particularly since many </p><p>suspected his involvement in Justice Minister Bola </p><p>Ige\'s assassination. The more prominent George and his </p><p>confrontational tactics became, the less Obasanjo had </p><p>a chance of carrying the Southwest as a bloc. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 5. (C) Tinubu continued that AD governors would not </p><p>help extend Obasanjo\'s tenancy in Aso Rock while PDP </p><p>challengers were trying to oust them from the various </p><p>gubernatorial mansions. The AD was so entrenched that </p><p>the PDP would not win many converts in the region </p><p>despite the party\'s aggressive approach. "The AD could </p><p>run a dog for election in Lagos and still win!" Tinubu </p><p>hyperbolized. Conversely, lack of AD support could </p><p>cause an otherwise credible candidate to lose in the </p><p>region. Thus, while the PDP might win a few local </p><p>government seats, Obasanjo and the PDP were </p><p>essentially barking up the wrong tree by trying to </p><p>oust the AD from its Southwest stronghold. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Reviewing the state of play in Nigeria\'s other </p><p>geopolitical zones, Tinubu explained why Obasanjo </p><p>needed an AD alliance. The Northwest and Southeast </p><p>opposed the President. The Supreme Court decision on </p><p>oil resource allocation also has pitted the littoral </p><p>states of the South-South against the Administration, </p><p>particularly since the decision resulted from a case </p><p>instigated by the Federal Government. Unless Obasanjo </p><p>cut a resource allocation deal with those states, he </p><p>would lose them; moreover, Obasanjo is in trouble with </p><p>the populous Tiv of the Middle Belt due to last </p><p>October\'s massacre of civilians in Benue State. On the </p><p>positive side, Obasanjo only can count on the </p><p>Northeast because Vice President Atiku is from Adamawa </p><p>and on predominately Christian areas in the upper </p><p>reaches of the Middle Belt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>THE AD -- SPREADING BEYOND THE SOUTHWEST </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) For reelection, Tinubu said Obasanjo must </p><p>secure the Southwest as well as regain support in the </p><p>Middle Belt and South-South. A deal with the AD would </p><p>give Obasanjo the first (the Southwest) and place him </p><p>in position to secure the second and third objectives. </p><p>Attempting to show how the AD could help Obasanjo, </p><p>Tinubu stated his party has made headway at the local </p><p>and gubernatorial level beyond the immediate </p><p>Southwest. He claimed well-known businessman Great </p><p>Ogboru could snatch Edo State from the PDP incumbent </p><p>Lucky Igbenidion.  Also many Yoruba were decamping </p><p>from the APP (now ANPP) and the PDP in predominantly- </p><p>Yoruba Kwara State, due primarily to the squabble over </p><p>the enthronement of a Yoruba Oba to counter the </p><p>existence of the Emir of Ilorin. (The Emir belongs to </p><p>the Hausa-Fulani hierarchy; many Kwara Yoruba resent a </p><p>Hausa-Fulani being the preeminent local traditional </p><p>ruler in a majority Yoruba area.) Beyond gaining </p><p>ground in Kwara and Edo, two states on Yoruba-land\'s </p><p>periphery, Tinubu contended the AD had made advances </p><p>in Plateau State where its popular candidate David </p><p>Sango was in position to topple the embattled Joshua </p><p>Dariye. Tinubu also listed Borno and Nassarawa as </p><p>states that could fall to the AD. He felt that AD </p><p>support in Kaduna was growing, and AD support could </p><p>ensure that pivotal state, in some ways a microcosm of </p><p>Nigeria itself, remained in Obasanjo\'s camp. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The collaboration between the Yoruba and Tiv </p><p>which dates back to Olufemi Awolowo and Joseph Tarka, </p><p>respectively, meant a deal with the AD would help </p><p>Obasanjo regain some Tiv support notwithstanding last </p><p>October\'s massacre of civilians. By making inroads in </p><p>the states mentioned above, the AD could help Obasanjo </p><p>take the Middle Belt as well as the Southwest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) However, Tinubu stressed AD cooperation would </p><p>not come cheaply. The AD would require important </p><p>Cabinet and sub-Cabinet posts. Moreover, Obasanjo must </p><p>stop behaving autocratically. He would have to show he </p><p>was "willing to get out of his ivory tower and listen </p><p>sometimes."  With such a deal Obasanjo could spend his </p><p>time globetrotting and acting like an "international </p><p>statesman while letting others run things," Tinubu </p><p>said half-jokingly. He added that any deal on oil </p><p>revenue allocation with the South-South must include </p><p>both Ondo and Lagos because these AD-controlled States </p><p>had off-shore oil reserves, albeit much smaller than </p><p>those of the Delta states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Tinubu questioned whether Obasanjo had the </p><p>sagacity to cut a deal with the AD. Obasanjo was ill </p><p>served by his top campaign advisors, the Governor </p><p>maintained. For reasons that remain unclear, Obasanjo </p><p>reposed great confidence in Works and Housing Minister </p><p>Tony Anenih, the de facto campaign manager. Having </p><p>Anenih as a key advisor was like inviting "an </p><p>unfriendly cobra into the bedroom."  The Governor </p><p>recounted how Anenih as Chairman of the SDP, after </p><p>receiving a pay-off from Head of State Babangida, </p><p>supported the annulment of the 1993 election even </p><p>though the SDP\'s Moshood Abiola had won. Anenih was </p><p>now advising Obasanjo that he could deliver most of </p><p>the Governors if the President let him apply the </p><p>screws to the state executives. However, the </p><p>assumption that support of the Governors, especially </p><p>coerced support, would carry a state\'s electorate was </p><p>a tenuous leap in logic. For instance, Tinubu </p><p>forecasted Katsina Governor Yar a\'dua (PDP) would be </p><p>reelected by a handsome margin but Obasanjo would be </p><p>rejected in Katsina. Kano Governor Kwankwaso might eke </p><p>by, but Obasanjo\'s chances in Kano were dismal. Tinubu </p><p>expressed the same reservations about Kebbi State and </p><p>purported Obasanjo supporter Governor Aliero. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO NEEDS ATIKU </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Tinubu claimed Anenih\'s efforts to hitch </p><p>Obasanjo to the coattails of the governors while </p><p>ignoring Vice President Atiku was bad strategy since </p><p>Atiku was more popular with party faithful than </p><p>Obasanjo. Tinubu mischievously hoped Obasanjo would </p><p>ditch Atiku. This move would place the President under </p><p>heavy attack at the PDP convention. Given his flinty </p><p>disposition, the President would just say, "To hell </p><p>with it and all of you," then stomp back to his </p><p>"chicken farm in Ogun State where he belongs." An </p><p>incumbent President failing to win his party\'s </p><p>nomination would be a good tonic for Nigerian </p><p>democracy, Tinubu thought. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Because of his control of the PDP grassroots </p><p>machine, Atiku was Obasanjo\'s greatest asset within </p><p>the PDP, according to Tinubu. The Governor previously </p><p>had advised Obasanjo that Atiku was loyal and that he </p><p>should maintain a close relationship with his Vice </p><p>President. However, attentive to the whispers of </p><p>Anenih and NSA Aliyu Mohammed, Obasanjo had allowed </p><p>his relationship with Atiku to atrophy. Now, Obasanjo </p><p>was treating the individual he needed most like an </p><p>unwanted stepchild. Ditch Atiku, lose the nomination, </p><p>Tinubu iterated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Closer to home, Tinubu was confident he would </p><p>win reelection in Lagos State despite the defection </p><p>and open hostility of his Deputy Governor. He believed </p><p>his performance has been sufficiently credible and </p><p>that AD would remain preeminent in Lagos State. He </p><p>predicted Deputy Governor Bucknor would decamp to the </p><p>ANPP, a party where she had her political home before, </p><p>to run against him.  He discounted her threat and felt </p><p>the PDP opposition would also be minimal; no eminent </p><p>Lagosian wanted to contest against the AD in what </p><p>would be a very steep uphill battle. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) While his view probably overestimated AD </p><p>strength in the Southwest and its inroads in other </p><p>parts of the country, Tinubu offered a rational, </p><p>insightful analysis of presidential electoral </p><p>politics. Like Tinubu, we believe significant </p><p>opposition awaits Obasanjo in the Southeast and </p><p>Northwest. The Middle Belt and South-South will be the </p><p>decisive battlegrounds but only if Obasanjo first has </p><p>the Southwest in his grasp. Unlike 1999, it is </p><p>difficult to imagine a scenario where Obasanjo is </p><p>reelected without carrying his home region. While </p><p>Obasanjo needs the Southwest, some Yoruba politicians </p><p>seem to be drawing the pragmatic conclusion that they </p><p>also need him. They may need to hitch themselves to </p><p>him to prevent the Southwest from being shut out of </p><p>national politics by the potential North-Southeastern </p><p>axis that might emerge from among the other opposition </p><p>parties. In Nigerian politics, blood still appears to </p><p>be thicker than water it seems. Thus, a flawed </p><p>Obasanjo may be better than no Yoruba at all. This is </p><p>the unspoken subtext of Tinubu\'s exposition. In short, </p><p>Obasanjo and the Yoruba-dominated AD are natural </p><p>allies in an electoral milieu heavily influenced by </p><p>ethnic, regional and historical factors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
