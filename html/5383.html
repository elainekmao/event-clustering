<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000231 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PINR, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: GERARDI WITNESS FOUND DEAD </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 GUATEMALA 2649 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: A key witness in the Gerardi trial was </p><p>reportedly murdered on December 19, 2002.  The body of the </p><p>witness, Noe Gomez Limon, was found on January 21, nearly a </p><p>month after the murder, and details about the murder remain </p><p>fragmentary.  On January 22, MINUGUA called on the government </p><p>to investigate his death and to protect the remaining </p><p>witnesses in the Gerardi case.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Noe Gomez Limon was an inmate at the prison in </p><p>Antigua, Guatemala in 1998, along with his brother, Gilberto </p><p>Gomez Limon.  Gilberto testified during the summer 2001 </p><p>Gerardi murder trial that he saw fellow inmate Obdulio </p><p>Villanueva leave the prison the night of Bishop Gerardi\'s </p><p>murder, April 26, 1998.  In the 2001 trial, Noe testified </p><p>that he had repeatedly been threatened in an effort to </p><p>silence his brother Gilberto. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) MINUGUA and the Archbishop\'s Office on Human Rights </p><p>(ODHA) confirmed Noe Gomez Limon\'s accounts of being under </p><p>threat until his murder in December.  His brother Gilberto\'s </p><p>testimony was considered "key" to the verdict in 2001, when </p><p>Obdulio Villanueva was found guilty along with three other </p><p>defendants.  That verdict is now in question, after one </p><p>appeals court annulled the sentence and ordered a retrial </p><p>(reftel), prompting another court to uphold the 2001 sentence </p><p>while an appeal of the retrial decision is heard.  ODHA </p><p>director Nery Rodenas told HROff that the public audience for </p><p>the presentation of the appeals will be held on January 31. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Rodenas also informed HROff that Noe Gomez Limon was </p><p>under the Public Ministry\'s witness protection program in </p><p>another country until sometime in 2002, when he relinquished </p><p>their protection and returned to Guatemala.  Rodenas assumes </p><p>that this was an attempt to intimidate Gilberto Gomez Limon, </p><p>brother of slain Noe Gomez Limon, from returning to Guatemala </p><p>should another trial be ordered by the courts.  Gilberto is </p><p>still in the witness protection program and his testimony is </p><p>crucial to the prosecution\'s case against Obdulio Villanueva. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Rodenas said that this is the first witness from the </p><p>Gerardi case that has been murdered, while virtually all of </p><p>the witnesses for the prosecution have been threatened since </p><p>their involvement in the events of April 26, 1998.  Rodenas </p><p>is troubled by the reluctance of the Public Ministry to </p><p>investigate Gomez Limon\'s death, especially because his </p><p>murder was not reported until a month after it supposedly </p><p>occurred in his home.  Rodenas said the longer the Public </p><p>Ministry waits to conduct the investigation, the less likely </p><p>it is they will obtain any results that would help shed light </p><p>on who is behind the murder. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) COMMENT: Continued attempts to intimidate and </p><p>eliminate witnesses in the Gerardi case remain deeply </p><p>troubling.  Whether this murder was politically motivated </p><p>remains to be proven, though we are inclined to agree with </p><p>Rodenas that the convenient timing of the murder so close to </p><p>the impending appeals decision is no coincidence.  Ambassador </p><p>is raising this case and our concern about the Gerardi appeal </p><p>status with the Attorney General.  End Comment. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
