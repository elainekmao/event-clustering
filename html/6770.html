<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0084 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MARCH 25, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for March 25, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Tercuman: After granting overflight rights to </p><p>U.S. and British aircraft, Turkey restricted </p><p>civilian flights in East and Southeast Turkey. </p><p>Private flights other than scheduled THY flights </p><p>are subjected to special permission. Eight </p><p>provinces have been entirely closed to air </p><p>traffic, and THY cancelled its regular flights to </p><p>Mardin, Sanliurfa and Gaziantep. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet: As the Americans keep withdrawing </p><p>from the bases in Mardin province, they halted </p><p>their activities at Iskenderun port. The Turkish </p><p>workers at the port said they had been told the </p><p>operations were halted temporarily. Military </p><p>equipment dispatched from Nusaybin started </p><p>arriving at the Iskenderun port. Because of a </p><p>monetary dispute between the Delta Shipping </p><p>Company and truckers, some truckers refused </p><p>carrying military equipment from Nusaybin to </p><p>Iskenderun. In response, the shipping company </p><p>made a deal with other truckers for the </p><p>deliveries.  The US troops are getting ready to </p><p>leave Kiziltepe (Mardin), too. Fifteen trucks are </p><p>reportedly waiting in front of the industrial </p><p>zone there in order to transport equipment. </p><p>Operations that were being conducted with heavy </p><p>construction machinery have stopped. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Cumhuriyet: The Americans are seeking to get </p><p>back some of the cash they had paid for leasing </p><p>the shops at Nusaybin\'s Industrial Zone. The U.S. </p><p>had paid one month\'s rent, a total of USD </p><p>248,000, for the 154 shops at the industrial </p><p>zone.  Now, the U.S. has been demanding </p><p>reimbursement, prorating the rent.  On the other </p><p>hand, it is claimed that some shopkeepers who </p><p>provided some services to the U.S. are trying to </p><p>collect unpaid debts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Bolge: The US military experts visiting the </p><p>scene of the bomb fallen near Ozveren village of </p><p>Birecik township in Sanliurfa province were the </p><p>targets of protests by  villagers shouting "No to </p><p>war". The U.S. military delegation removed the </p><p>bomb fragment and took it back to Incirlik Air </p><p>Force Base, and apologized to the villagers for </p><p>the mistake, assuring them that such mistakes </p><p>would not happen again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Turkiye: The Turkish Armed Forces continue </p><p>increasing measures against a possible migration </p><p>across the border. Some 150 soldiers from </p><p>assorted units were dispatched in a military </p><p>convoy of 30 vehicles from Mardin to Silopi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Turkiye: The head of the Turkish General </p><p>Staff, Hilmi Ozkok, will inspect Second Army </p><p>Units on the border region today and tomorrow. It </p><p>is reported by the TGS that General Ozkok will </p><p>make a press announcement at the 7th Corps Command </p><p>Headquarters in Diyarbakir tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Turkiye: Based on a tip, police from the </p><p>Tarsus (Mersin) Security Directorate arrested six </p><p>alleged PKK members who were involved in hanging </p><p>banners, blocking roads, burning tires, and </p><p>shouting pro-PKK slogans. The detainees, who were </p><p>brought before the court after their </p><p>interrogations at the police station, were </p><p>ordered held in custody. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Evrensel: 36 students were arrested and </p><p>brought before the court by jandarma at the </p><p>Centennial University of Van while trying to hold </p><p>Newroz festivities in the university campus on </p><p>March 20. Some 11 of the detainees were ordered </p><p>held, but were later released. </p><p>10.  Evrensel: DEHAP\'s Hazro (Diyarbakir) </p><p>District Chairman, Hamit Ergin, who had hung a </p><p>DEHAP flag from the window of his house and </p><p>forgot to take it down, was given six months of </p><p>imprisonment on the charges of "violating the </p><p>Election Law". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Turkiye: The President of the Southeastern </p><p>Businessmen and Industrialists Association, </p><p>Bedrettin Karaboga, announced that the </p><p>businessmen in the Southeast were the ones mostly </p><p>affected by the war. Karaboga urged that the </p><p>region should be declared a "Disaster Region," </p><p>and the merchants\' and businessmen\'s Social </p><p>Security and Income Tax debts should be </p><p>postponed.
