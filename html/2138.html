HANOI 2490 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02884  01 OF 02  051001Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY POL/C SCOTT D. BELLARD, REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  SUMMARY:  THE GVN EXPLAINS ITS STERN TREATMENT OF </p><p>THOSE IT DEEMS "POLITICAL" ACTIVISTS SUCH AS FATHER LY AND </p><p>TRAN KHUE IN TERMS OF DEFENDING NATIONAL UNITY.  THE GVN </p><p>SEEMS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO ITS OWN CITIZENS\' CRITIQUES </p><p>WHEN THEY ARE INTENDED FOR OVERSEAS AUDIENCES, ALTHOUGH </p><p>THIS REACTION DRAWS EVEN MORE FOREIGN INTEREST.  EMBASSY </p><p>CONTINUES TO REMIND THE GVN THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>WELFARE OF THESE ACTIVISTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  EMBASSY HAS EXPRESSED USG CONCERN OVER FATHER </p><p>NGUYEN VAN LY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS SINCE HE RECEIVED HIS </p><p>HARSH CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES TOTALING 15 YEARS ON OCTOBER </p><p>19.  POL/C RAISED THE SUBJECT TO THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS (MFA) ON OCTOBER 22 (REF A).  ON OCTOBER 24 CHARGE </p><p>VOICED HIS CONCERN ABOUT LY\'S SENTENCING WITH BUI THE GIANG </p><p>OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S EXTERNAL </p><p>RELATIONS COMMISSION.  POLOFF BROUGHT UP THE NEGATIVE </p><p>IMPACT OF FATHER LY\'S TREATMENT WHILE PRESENTING THE MFA\'S </p><p>AMERICAS </p><p>DEPARTMENT WITH A COPY OF THE 2001 INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM REPORT ON OCTOBER 26, AND AGAIN CITED USG CONCERN AT </p><p>LENGTH WITH AMERICAS DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL ON NOVEMBER 1. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)   AS DESCRIBED IN REF A, THE GVN HAS CONSISTENTLY </p><p>PRESENTED FATHER LY\'S CASE AS NON-RELIGIOUS AND CLAIMS TO </p><p>BASE ITS TREATMENT OF HIM NOT AS A RELIGIOUS FIGURE, BUT AS </p><p>SOMEONE WHO WAS "INCITING BELIEVERS AND SOWING UNREST." </p><p>THE MFA AMERICAS DEPARTMENT\'S TRAN THI VAN ON NOVEMBER 1, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02884  01 OF 02  051001Z </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE GVN HAD THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED LY AND </p><p>THAT HIS EARLIER (1997) 2-YEAR PROBATION SENTENCE HAD BEEN </p><p>GUIDED BY THE STATE\'S "HUMANITARIAN AND TOLERANT POLICY" AS </p><p>IT SOUGHT TO "REMIND" HIM OF HOW HE COULD "TRULY HELP THE </p><p>COMMUNITY."  COMMENTING ON LY\'S 13-YEAR SENTENCE FOR </p><p>"DAMAGING THE UNITY POLICY," SHE REMARKED THAT THIS IS "A </p><p>VERY SERIOUS CRIME," SINCE IT UNDERMINES ONE OF THE </p><p>GVN\'S CENTRAL POLICIES.  VAN ACCUSED LY OF BEING </p><p>"SELF-SERVING AND UNWILLING TRULY TO HELP THE PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  OTHER EMBASSIES ARE ALSO RESPONDING TO THE GVN\'S </p><p>TREATMENT OF LY.  THE DEPARTING FRENCH AMBASSADOR REPORTEDLY </p><p>RECEIVED A NEGATIVE REACTION FROM A SENIOR MFA OFFICIAL WHEN </p><p>HE BROUGHT UP FATHER LY DURING HIS FINAL CALL.  DIPLOMATS FROM </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION (EU) MEMBER STATES HAVE TOLD CHARGE AND POLOFF </p><p>THAT EU MEMBER COUNTRIES ARE ATTEMPTING TO FORMULATE A UNIFIED </p><p>RESPONSE TO FATHER LY\'S SENTENCING.  ON NOVEMBER 1, A SWEDISH </p><p>POLOFF TOLD POLOFF THAT THE EU RESPONSE WOULD PROBABLY COME IN </p><p>THE FOLLOWING WEEK.  ACCORDING TO BRITISH POLOFF JONATHAN </p><p>DUNN, EU MEMBERS DISAGREE OVER HOW STRONG TO MAKE THEIR </p><p>RESPONSE BECAUSE OF DOUBTS ABOUT FATHER LY\'S INTEGRITY AND </p><p>"RESPECTABILITY."  THESE DOUBTS INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS SUCH AS </p><p>THOSE MADE IN THE LOCAL (STATE-OWNED) MEDIA THAT FATHER LY HAS </p><p>FATHERED CHILDREN AS WELL AS MORE GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>WHETHER LY IS HELD IN ANY ESTEEM BY OTHER RELIGIOUS FIGURES, </p><p>OR BY "THE PEOPLE" AT LARGE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  NETHERLANDS POLOFF MERONA VANDEN HEUVEL TOLD </p><p>POLOFF ON OCTOBER 31 THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TO SEVERAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS FIGURES IN THUA TIEN HUE PROVINCE ABOUT FATHER LY </p><p>DURING THE WEEK AFTER HIS OCTOBER 19 SENTENCING.  SHE SAID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02884  01 OF 02  051001Z </p><p>BUDDHIST NUNS THERE HAD SAID THAT THEY WERE SADDENED BY </p><p>LY\'S SENTENCE BECAUSE IT SHOWED HOW STRONGLY THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES REACT AGAINST THOSE WHO SPEAK OUT. (NOTE: THESE </p><p>NUNS ARE PROBABLY AFFILIATED WITH THE UNITED BUDDHIST </p><p>CHURCH OF VIETNAM (UBCV).  END NOTE.)  THE NUNS CLAIMED </p><p>THAT LY\'S SENTENCE WAS SO HARSH BECAUSE BY SENDING HIS </p><p>CRITIQUES OVERSEAS, HE HAD EMBARRASSED THE AUTHORITIES </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY, A MUCH WORSE OFFENSE THAN CRITICIZING THEM </p><p>DOMESTICALLY.  THE NETHERLANDS POLOFF ALSO REPORTED </p><p>HAVING SPOKEN WITH PROMINENT UBCV MONK THICH THAI HOA, WHO IS </p><p>CURRENTLY UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION.  HE WAS ALSO </p><p>REPORTEDLY SADDENED BY LY\'S SENTENCE, BUT NOT AT ALL </p><p>SURPRISED.  THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE THUA TIEN HUE </p><p>PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE COMPLAINED TO THE DUTCH </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT EVENING, ACCORDING TO VANDEN HEUVEL, THAT </p><p>IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE FOR HER TO HAVE VISITED THICH THAI </p><p>HOA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  POLOFF ALSO ASKED MFA AMERICAS DEPARTMENT\'S MS. </p><p>VAN ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD </p><p>SOUGHT GOVERNMENT PERMISSION TO FORM AN ANTI-CORRUPTION NGO </p><p>IN EARLY SEPTEMBER (REF C).  VAN, NAMING TRAN KHUE WITHOUT </p><p>SPECIFIC PROMPTING, SAID THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN BROUGHT </p><p>BEFORE THE COURTS, BUT WOULD BE IF HE CONTINUED TO ENGAGE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IN ACTIVITIES THAT WERE NOT "APPROPRIATE."  SHE COMPARED </p><p>KHUE TO FATHER LY, CLAIMING THAT HE ALSO WAS ACTING IN HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02884  02 OF 02  051001Z </p><p>OWN INTEREST AND WAS NOT TRULY INTERESTED IN HELPING "THE </p><p>PEOPLE."  WHEN ASKED, SHE STATED SPECIFICALLY THAT HE WAS </p><p>NOT UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION (DECREE 31/CP), BUT WAS </p><p>AS FREE TO TRAVEL AND TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE AS ANYONE ELSE. </p><p>(NOTE:  HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH REPORTED RECEIVING INFORMATION </p><p>FROM TRAN KHUE THAT HE HAD RECEIVED AN ORDER DATED OCTOBER 17 </p><p>PLACING HIM UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH\'S INFORMATION, KHUE REFUSED TO ACCEPT </p><p>THIS ORDER, SO IT WAS NOT YET IN EFFECT.  THEREFORE, EVEN IF </p><p>SUCH AN ORDER HAS BEEN ISSUED, MS. VAN MAY TECHNICALLY HAVE </p><p>BEEN CORRECT.  END NOTE.)  VAN REITERATED AN EARLIER </p><p>RECOMMENDATION (REF D) NOT TO CONTACT MEMBERS OF THIS </p><p>GROUP DIRECTLY BECAUSE IT WOULD HURT BILATERAL RELATIONS AT </p><p>A SENSITIVE TIME. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  EMBOFFS WILL CONTINUE FORCEFULLY TO </p><p>EXPRESS OUR DISMAY OVER FATHER LY\'S SENTENCING.  REGRETTABLY, </p><p>EMBASSY CONTINUES TO DOUBT THAT SUCH EXPRESSIONS WILL HAVE ANY </p><p>NOTICEABLE IMPACT IN CASES DEEMED BY THE GVN AS ESPECIALLY </p><p>SENSITIVE. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
