<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 TEGUCIGALPA 002534 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA, WHA/CEN, DRL, AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC </p><p>NSC FOR AMB MAISTO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 09/10/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PBTS, ETRD, ECON, KJUS, HO, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S REICH MEETS WITH HONDURAN PRESIDENT MADURO; </p><p>DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON BORDER/TARIFF DISPUTE WITH NICARAGUA </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Tegucigalpa 2472 </p><p> </p><p>Classified by PolChief Francisco Palmieri, Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  WHA A/S Reich met August 28 in Tegucigalpa </p><p>with Honduran President Ricardo Maduro.  The discussion was </p><p>positive and covered a wide range of issues, with the focus </p><p>being the ongoing dispute between Honduras and Nicaragua on </p><p>border issues and the Nicaraguan 35 percent tariff on </p><p>Honduran goods.  Reich praised Maduro for not imposing a </p><p>retaliatory tariff and urged him to seek an amicable </p><p>solution to the dispute.  Unfortunately, it appears that </p><p>there is no immediate solution in sight on the issue.  Reich </p><p>and Maduro also discussed the issue of an ICC Article 98 </p><p>Agreement (see reftel).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Participants in WHA A/S Reich meeting with Honduran </p><p>President Ricardo Maduro in Maduro\'s office in Tegucigalpa: </p><p> </p><p>USG: A/S Reich, Ambassador, WHA/CEN Director Trivelli, DCM, </p><p>PolCouns, EconCouns, and PolOff (notetaker). </p><p> </p><p>GOH: President Ricardo Maduro, Foreign Minister Guillermo </p><p>Perez-Cadalso Arias, Minister of the Presidency Luis </p><p>Cosenza, the President\'s Executive Assistant Xavier Arguello </p><p>and Cesar Batres, the President\'s Special Advisor on Land </p><p>Issues </p><p> </p><p>Nicaragua and the Tariff </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Maduro welcomed A/S Reich to Honduras and opened the </p><p>meeting by asking Reich about his trip to Nicaragua August </p><p>26-27, noting that the GOH has many issues pending with the </p><p>GON.  Reich told Maduro that he had met with prominent GON </p><p>officials while in Managua, including President Enrique </p><p>Bolanos.  Reich said Bolanos was doing the best he could </p><p>with a difficult situation, including a struggling economy. </p><p>Reich noted that Bolanos was attacking corruption, just as </p><p>Maduro was doing in Honduras.  Reich explained that the </p><p>question of stripping former President Arnoldo Aleman of his </p><p>congressional immunity was the major issue in Managua.  He </p><p>added that he had also discussed obstacles to Central </p><p>American integration, including the 35 percent tariff </p><p>leveled in late 1999 against Honduran goods by Nicaragua. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Maduro replied that it appeared reversing the tariff </p><p>had unfortunately become linked to the debate over stripping </p><p>Aleman\'s congressional immunity.  Maduro then recalled that </p><p>Nicaragua\'s 35 percent tariff on Honduran goods was imposed </p><p>by the Nicaraguan Congress in reaction to Honduras ratifying </p><p>a Caribbean maritime boundary treaty with Colombia in 1999. </p><p>He explained that the Nicaraguans felt the treaty ignored </p><p>GON territorial claims.  Maduro said he understood the GON </p><p>position that the GOH had to renounce its treaty with </p><p>Colombia.  However, Maduro said now that the GON has filed a </p><p>case before the International Court of Justice on the </p><p>maritime boundary the GOH\'s position is that it will await </p><p>the court\'s ruling on its boundary claims before taking any </p><p>action on that treaty. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Maduro outlined how Honduran FM Perez-Cadalso had </p><p>explored options to resolve the tariff issue with Nicaraguan </p><p>FM Norman Caldera.  GOH/GON discussions had included the </p><p>possibility of joint maritime exploitation not just in </p><p>disputed areas, but in all areas.  Maduro recognized that </p><p>Aleman had criticized Bolanos for seeking cooperation with </p><p>the GOH.  However, Maduro charged that Caldera\'s recent </p><p>statements on oil exploration in the Caribbean were contrary </p><p>to statements made in private GOH/GON discussions and done </p><p>for political reasons.  He explained that those comments had </p><p>provoked a strong negative reaction in the Honduran Congress </p><p>and private sector. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Maduro also detailed efforts made by Cardinal </p><p>Rodriguez, the Archbishop of Tegucigalpa, to approach his </p><p>Nicaraguan counterpart Cardinal Obando y Bravo to discus the </p><p>possible elimination of the tariff but that Obando y Bravo </p><p>had declined to get involved.  Subsequently FM Perez- </p><p>Cadalso, Nicaraguan MFA Sub-Secretary Salvatore (FM Caldera </p><p>did not attend), and Vatican officials discussed the issue </p><p>of possible Vatican mediation of the issue without success. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Maduro said he understood that Bolanos had the </p><p>political will to eliminate the tariff but recognized the </p><p>problem Bolanos faced with Aleman.  He offered that the GOH </p><p>was looking at different approaches to solve the tariff </p><p>problem, but warned that domestic political pressure on him </p><p>to take action was growing.  He explained that some </p><p>political opponents were alleging he was not taking the </p><p>border issue seriously because he was not really Honduran. </p><p>(Note:  Maduro was born in Panama and the issue of his </p><p>citizenship was a hot political issue during the 2001 </p><p>presidential campaign.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Maduro said he was seeking to dampen political </p><p>rhetoric on the tariff issue and hoped to find a creative </p><p>solution.  However, he flagged that even deputies of his own </p><p>party (the National Party) were calling for a retaliatory </p><p>tariff.  Maduro underscored his strong personal belief that </p><p>a retaliatory tariff would be contrary to Central American </p><p>integration.  Reich complimented Maduro and the GOH for not </p><p>responding with a retaliatory tariff against Nicaraguan </p><p>goods. </p><p> </p><p>Gulf Of Fonseca </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Maduro also discussed the Gulf of Fonseca border </p><p>dispute with El Salvador and Nicaragua, saying that the 1992 </p><p>ICJ ruling had clearly given Honduras an exit point from the </p><p>Gulf in the Pacific Ocean.  Maduro opined that a trilateral </p><p>economic agreement to develop the gulf would be the best </p><p>solution.  However, he noted that the Inter-American </p><p>Development Bank did not want to get involved in the issue </p><p>due to a lack of interest from the GON and GOES. He noted </p><p>that the 10-year anniversary of the ICJ ruling on the </p><p>Honduran/Salvadoran border would occur September 11.  Maduro </p><p>said he wanted to lower border tensions and emphasize </p><p>positive economic issues between the countries. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) A/S Reich responded that the USG would be happy to </p><p>help if it could to reduce tensions in Central America.  He </p><p>noted that no one wanted to return to the tensions of the </p><p>1980s.  Reich emphasized that President Bush was very </p><p>interested in Central America.  Reich added that Honduras </p><p>needed to catch up economically with El Salvador and Costa </p><p>Rica, but acknowledged that would not be easy and that </p><p>expectations needed to be realistic. </p><p> </p><p>Regional Disarmament? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Maduro said that he had discussed with El Salvadoran </p><p>President Francisco Flores the idea of regional disarmament. </p><p>Maduro said that if disarmament occurred it could lead to </p><p>savings that could be used for social investment.  A/S Reich </p><p>said that the USG was concerned about the number of arms in </p><p>Central America, and cited the recent case of 3,000 rifles </p><p>that went from Nicaragua to Colombia via Panama.  Reich also </p><p>noted that in Nicaragua there was a plethora of AK-47 rifles </p><p>but a shortage of pistols for police.  He stressed that all </p><p>of the arms left over from the 1970s and 80s in the region </p><p>concerned the U.S.  Maduro noted that Honduras had fewer </p><p>weapons and a smaller military than its neighbors do and was </p><p>concerned by its neighbors\' military spending.  Maduro said </p><p>that the GOH could not invest in military hardware because </p><p>it needed the money for police, teachers, and other </p><p>important productive domestic investments.  He asked for </p><p>U.S. support on the disarmament issue, saying American </p><p>leadership would be helpful.  A/S Reich offered U.S. and </p><p>pledged to look into ways to assist this effort. </p><p> </p><p>Trade is Key </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Maduro emphasized his vision that Central American </p><p>integration and free trade within the region were key to </p><p>making progress against poverty in the region.  He noted he </p><p>has now met with Bolanos and Flores together at least 4 </p><p>times since taking office in January.  He shared that he </p><p>would soon meet again privately with Bolanos, and separately </p><p>with Flores, to encourage more concrete efforts toward </p><p>regional integration. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Maduro stressed the importance of a Central American </p><p>free trade agreement with the U.S.  Maduro said the GOH was </p><p>happy about the U.S. Congress voting to grant the President </p><p>Trade Promotion Authority.  Maduro pointed out that </p><p>increased trade was key to reducing illegal immigration to </p><p>the U.S., but underscored that Honduran remittances from the </p><p>U.S. were a critical element to maintaining a stable </p><p>economic situation in Honduras.  Maduro said he hoped the </p><p>proposed Central America Free Trade Agreement would boost </p><p>foreign investment in the region.  A/S Reich said such </p><p>investment usually followed a trade agreement, especially if </p><p>progress was made against corruption and in favor of </p><p>judicial security. </p><p> </p><p>Land Disputes and the Administration of Justice </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>14. (C) Maduro introduced Cesar Batres, his Legal Advisor, </p><p>who explained (as expected) that the GOH had decided to seek </p><p>to resolve land disputes involving the GOH by submitting </p><p>them to arbitration (similar to the process used in Costa </p><p>Rica for expropriation cases).  The proposal required a </p><p>change in legislation.  Batres provided the draft law </p><p>prepared by the Supreme Court to Ambassador.  A/S Reich and </p><p>Ambassador thanked Maduro for this initiative. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Reich noted that the administration of justice (AOJ) </p><p>was key for investment.  Why would a business invest if the </p><p>law and protection for investments were not clear when they </p><p>could invest in another location where investments were </p><p>protected, asked Reich.  Maduro agreed that AOJ was critical </p><p>for investment. </p><p> </p><p>Limited Progress on Economic and Security Problems </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) On agricultural issues, Maduro suggested the need </p><p>for a coordinated international response to the free-fall in </p><p>coffee prices.  Reich noted the importance of coffee in </p><p>Central America and the challenge producers in Central </p><p>America and the Andean Region faced from Vietnamese coffee. </p><p>Maduro said that even though oversupply had led to falling </p><p>producer prices, it had not affected consumer prices, which </p><p>if anything were rising. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Maduro commented that the tourism and textile </p><p>sectors were improved.  He said his administration was </p><p>trying to foster home ownership, infrastructure development, </p><p>and micro and small businesses.  Maduro explained that </p><p>though the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was </p><p>disappointed in the GOH\'s wage settlement with teachers, he </p><p>hoped they would be successful in negotiating a new three- </p><p>year IMF program, when the IMF team arrived in October.  He </p><p>indicated that tax receipts had risen since July, due to use </p><p>of enforcement measures in the new tax law that included </p><p>temporarily closing businesses that did not pay taxes. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Maduro noted he had boosted police patrols with the </p><p>military to crack down on crime and claimed that both </p><p>homicides and crime in general had dropped since his </p><p>inauguration. </p><p> </p><p>GOH Appreciates Visit </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) Reich thanked Maduro for the GOH\'s support on issues </p><p>of concern to the USG at the UN.  Maduro thanked Reich for </p><p>his visit and noted that U.S. support is key and very much </p><p>appreciated.  Maduro praised retiring Ambassador as a friend </p><p>of Honduras and of Maduro. </p><p> </p><p>Candid Discussion Reveals No Quick End to Tariff Issue </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) Comment.  Reich and Maduro had a friendly and open </p><p>discussion, dominated by discussion of the tariff and border </p><p>dispute with Nicaragua.  In the lengthy talk it was clear </p><p>that there was no immediate solution at hand on the tariff </p><p>issue.  Maduro is likely to face growing political pressure </p><p>to retaliate against the Nicaraguan tariff unless there are </p><p>signs of progress in resolving the issue.  Reich\'s visit was </p><p>an important statement that the USG recognizes Maduro\'s </p><p>leadership in avoiding such retaliation, and that its </p><p>resolution is key to Central American free trade and </p><p>integration. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
