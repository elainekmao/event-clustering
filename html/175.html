FOLLOWING IS AN OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY SENT TO THE </p><p>EMBASSY FROM CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S OFFICE IN THE </p><p>NATIONAL GUARD TO ASSIST IN PLANNING FOR ABDULLAH\'S </p><p>VISIT TO WASHINGTON.  WHILE THE BIOGRAPHY CONTAINS </p><p>NOTHING SURPRISING, IT IS NOTEWORTHY FOR ITS EMPHASIS ON </p><p>THE CONTINUITY OF THE AL SAUD PRESENCE IN THE ARABIAN </p><p>PENINSULA SINCE THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND ITS STRESS ON </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S ROLE AS AN INTERNATIONAL STATESMAN.  AN </p><p>UNOFFICIAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION FOLLOWS.  WE WILL POUCH </p><p>ORIGINAL ARABIC TO NEA/ARP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT OF CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S BIOGRAPHY: </p><p> </p><p>HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE ABDULLAH IBN ABD AL-AZIZ </p><p>CROWN PRINCE, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND </p><p>COMMANDER OF THE SAUDI ARABIAN NATIONAL GUARD </p><p> </p><p>BIRTH: </p><p> </p><p>HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE ABDULLAH IBN ABD AL-AZIZ IBN </p><p>ABD AR-RAHMAN AL-FAYSAL AL SAUD WAS BORN IN THE CITY OF </p><p>RIYADH, CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA IN 1343H </p><p>CORRESPONDING TO 1924 AD. </p><p> </p><p>HIS FAMILY: </p><p> </p><p>HE BELONGS TO THE AL SAUD FAMILY.  HIS FATHER IS THE </p><p>LATE KING ABD AL-AZIZ IBN ABD AR-RAHMAN AL-FAYSAL AL </p><p>SAUD (1880-1953 A.D.), WHO FOUNDED THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA AFTER HE BOLDLY EMBARKED ON THE BATTLE TO UNIFY </p><p>THE ARABIAN PENINSULA IN THE FIRST THIRD OF THE 20TH </p><p>CENTURY.  HE BROUGHT HIS PEOPLE FROM A STATE OF </p><p>CONTENTIOUS TRIBES AND SMALL, ISOLATED PRINCIPALITIES </p><p>INTO A MODERN ARAB NATION THAT HAS ADOPTED ISLAM BOTH AS </p><p>A WAY OF LIFE AND CONSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT.  KING ABD </p><p>AL-AZIZ ALWAYS BELIEVED, "WE, THE AL SAUD, ARE FIRST A </p><p>HOUSE WITH A RELIGIOUS MESSAGE, AND THEN A HOUSE OF </p><p>RULERS." </p><p> </p><p>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND: </p><p> </p><p>THE AL SAUD FAMILY TRACES ITS ROOTS TO THE TRIBE OF ANZA </p><p>IBN RABE\'A, NUMERICALLY THE LARGEST ARAB TRIBE.  IT CAME </p><p>INTO PROMINENCE DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES AS THE </p><p>FAMILY OF REFORM AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE INTELLECTUAL, </p><p>CULTURAL, AND LINGUISTIC UNITY OF THE ARAB PENINSULA, </p><p>BASED ON THE ISLAMIC TRADITIONALIST MOVEMENT FOUNDED BY </p><p>A SON OF THE NEW-ISLAMIC RENAISSANCE, SHEIKH MOHAMMAD </p><p>IBN ABD AL-WAHAB (1703-1792 AD).  FIRST AMONG THOSE WHO </p><p>SUPPORTED THE SHEIKH IN THE SPREAD OF HIS CALL WAS </p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD IBN SAUD WHO DIED IN 1765H.  HE WAS THE </p><p>FOUNDER OF THE FIRST SAUDI DYNASTY, WHICH ITSELF PASSED </p><p>THROUGH SEVERAL STAGES, INCLUDING THE PERIOD OF THE </p><p>GREAT IMAMS WHO FOUGHT SUPERSTITIONS, UNIFIED THE RANKS </p><p>OF THE NATION AND WERE DEEMED TO BE THE PIONEERS OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS, ETHICAL, AND SOCIAL REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNIFICATION AND RENOVATION MOVEMENT LED BY KING ABD </p><p>AL-AZIZ, FATHER OF PRINCE ABDULLAH, IS A CONTINUATION OF </p><p>THE STRUGGLE OF HIS FAMILY TO MOTIVATE MUSLIM ARAB </p><p>SOCIETY TOWARD A REAWAKENING AND STRUCTURING, BASED ON </p><p>TRUE FAITH, RETURN TO THE PURE TEACHINGS OF THE HOLY </p><p>KORAN AND PURE PROPHETIC TRADITIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INFLUENCES IN PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S LIFE: </p><p> </p><p>A.  PRINCE ABDULLAH LEARNED POLITICS AT HIS FATHER\'S SIDE. </p><p> </p><p>B.  HE BEGAN HIS EDUCATION IN THE TRADITIONAL ISLAMIC </p><p>WAY, IN THE MOSQUES UNDER RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS WHO </p><p>CULTIVATED HIS MIND.  HE IS AN AVID AND VORACIOUS READER </p><p>INTERESTED IN CULTURE, POLITICS, AND ECONOMICS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.  HIS FAMILY: </p><p> </p><p>FOUR OF THE CROWN PRINCE\'S BROTHERS, UNDER WHOM HE HAS </p><p>SERVED IN THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT, HAVE BEEN KING: </p><p> </p><p>--SAUD IBN ABD AL-AZIZ (1952-1964) </p><p>--FAYSAL IBN ABD AL-AZIZ (1964-1975) </p><p>--KHALED IBN ABD AL-AZIZ (1975-1982) </p><p>--KING FAHD IBN ABD AL-AZIZ, THE CURRENT KING (WHOM </p><p>  PRINCE ABDULLAH NOW SERVES AS CROWN PRINCE) </p><p> </p><p>D.  AS CROWN PRINCE, PRINCE ABDULLAH IS IN CLOSE CONTACT </p><p>WITH URBAN, RURAL AND DESERT SAUDI SOCIETY.  HE OFTEN </p><p>MEETS WITH THE ULEMA, SHEIKHS AND RELIGIOUS COUNSELORS </p><p>FOR AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AND CONSULTATIONS.  HE ALSO </p><p>RECEIVES ANY SAUDI NATIONAL WHO REQUESTS A MEETING WITH </p><p>HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FOR ANY RELIGIOUS OR MUNDANE MATTER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INSTALLATION OF PRINCE ABDULLAH AS CROWN PRINCE: </p><p> </p><p>ON SUNDAY, JUNE 13, 1982, THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>PROCLAIMED HIS MAJESTY KING FAHD IBN ABD AL-AZIZ KING </p><p>AND LEADER AND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE ABDULLAH CROWN </p><p>PRINCE.  ALL MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THEM AND PAID HOMAGE TO THEM.  THE EVENING OF THE SAME </p><p>DAY, KING FAHD APPOINTED PRINCE ABDULLAH DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER AND COMMANDER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD, IN </p><p>ADDITION TO HIS POST AS CROWN PRINCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMANDER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD: </p><p> </p><p>WHEN KING FAYSAL IBN ABD AL-AZIZ ASSUMED POWER, HE WAS </p><p>FULLY AWARE THAT HIS ERA WOULD BE HISTORICALLY </p><p>SIGNIFICANT.  HE THEREFORE SELECTED HIS OFFICIALS FOR </p><p>THEIR QUALITY.  THE NATIONAL GUARD, WHICH BRINGS </p><p>TOGETHER THE DESCENDENTS OF THOSE WHO LIVED WITH KING </p><p>ABD AL-AZIZ WHEN HE UNITED THE KINGDOM, HAS A SPECIAL </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE.  THE NATIONAL GUARD NEEDED A MAN WHO COULD </p><p>LEAD AND DEVELOP THE FORCE INTO A SETTLED INSTITUTION. </p><p>PRINCE ABDULLAH WAS SUCH A MAN.  KING FAYSAL THEREFORE </p><p>CHOSE HIM TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY IN 1964 </p><p>(1384H).  PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S APPOINTMENT WAS A MILESTONE </p><p>FOR THE INSTITUTION, AND SINCE THEN, PRINCE ABDULLAH HAS </p><p>COMMANDED THE FORCE, A LEADER CLOSE TO HIS MEN WHO PAYS </p><p>ATTENTION TO THEIR CONCERNS AND LIVES, WITH THE </p><p>CONSCIENCE AND SPIRIT OF A MUSLIM COMMANDER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: </p><p> </p><p>IN 1975, KING KHALED APPOINTED PRINCE ABDULLAH SECOND </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, IN ADDITION TO HIS POST AS </p><p>COMMANDER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARAB AND ISLAMIC RELATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>AS PART OF THE POLICY OF THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN ARAB AND ISLAMIC SOLIDARITY AND PURSUE JOINT </p><p>ENDEAVORS WHICH SERVE THE ISLAMIC AND ARAB NATION AND TO </p><p>DEEPEN THE EXISTING BROTHERLY TIES AMONG ARAB STATES </p><p>WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ARAB LEAGUE AND THE ARAB </p><p>SUMMITS, PRINCE ABDULLAH HAS TRAVELED AND HAD NUMEROUS </p><p>CONTACTS WITH THE LEADERS OF THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC </p><p>WORLD.  THE CROWN PRINCE WORKS CONSTANTLY TO HEAL ARAB </p><p>RIFTS. </p><p> </p><p>IN HIS VIEW, RIYADH IS A PLACE OPEN TO ALL ARABS BECAUSE </p><p>OF THE KINGDOM\'S SPECIAL ROLE IN GUARDING THE HOLIEST </p><p>ARAB AND MUSLIM SHRINES. </p><p> </p><p>HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS HAS VISITED THE FOLLOWING ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES: </p><p> </p><p>1975  LEBANON </p><p>1977  EGYPT </p><p>1977  SYRIA </p><p>1977  JORDAN </p><p>1979  LIBYA </p><p>1979  UAE </p><p>1984  KUWAIT </p><p>1985  ALGERIA </p><p>1985  SYRIA </p><p>1986  YEMEN </p><p>1986  SYRIA </p><p>1986  IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OTHER MUSLIM COUNTRIES: </p><p> </p><p>1984  PAKISTAN </p><p>1984  TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARENA: </p><p> </p><p>IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA HAS A </p><p>MAJOR ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND A PIVOTAL </p><p>ROLE TO PLAY IN FURTHERING WORLD STABILITY.  IT ALSO </p><p>PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN OPEC, IN THE NORTH-SOUTH </p><p>DIALOGUE, AND IN COOPERATION BETWEEN THE NON-ALIGNED </p><p>STATES, AS WELL AS OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND </p><p>PROBLEMS.
