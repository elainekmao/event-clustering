<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000106 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR BSTILLMAN </p><p>DOC FOR ASTERN; ABENAISSA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ECON, EINV, CE, USTR, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA\'S LABOR RECORD MERITS RETAINING GSP </p><p> </p><p>REF: COLOMBO 53 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Though the GSL does need to improve its </p><p>handling of certain labor-related issues, it also has some </p><p>of the best labor conditions in the region.  The AFL-CIO </p><p>petition to lift GSP privileges from Sri Lanka focuses on </p><p>the one main area - union access in the Export Processing </p><p>Zones (EPZs) - that needs attention.  The current government </p><p>has begun to address this.  Given the low incidence of </p><p>forced labor and child labor, the strong legal structure and </p><p>relatively good working conditions in the country, Post </p><p>believes the issue of EPZ access does not warrant the </p><p>withdrawal of the GSL\'s GSP benefits.  Withdrawing GSP now </p><p>would also send conflicting signals to a new government </p><p>enmeshed in a fledgling peace process and major economic </p><p>reforms to which the US has pledged strong support.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>A strong labor record overall... </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Sri Lanka is a member of the ILO, has ratified seven </p><p>of eight conventions on labor standards and is in the </p><p>process of approving the eighth.  Over 50 statutes cover </p><p>labor laws.   There is a very active, politicized labor </p><p>movement in the country, which exercises its right to </p><p>protest and strike on a regular basis.   Reftel reports on </p><p>the influence organized labor had in changing the new labor </p><p>bills recently passed in Parliament.  The GSL made changes </p><p>in reaction to pressure by labor concerns, despite these </p><p>bills being viewed as a pro-business development. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The cost of Sri Lankan labor is higher than in other </p><p>south Asian countries partially because labor standards are </p><p>higher.  One expat country manager of a US garment firm says </p><p>she spends 80% of her time monitoring standards and </p><p>regulations.  Another visiting representative of a US firm </p><p>said the working conditions he saw at a garment factory were </p><p>the best he had seen in the world.  Even local labor </p><p>representatives have said to Laboff that the laws are good, </p><p>they just need to be enforced equally throughout the </p><p>country.  USAID has been working closely with the Ministry </p><p>of Employment and Labor on a Productivity Policy.  USAID </p><p>plans to support workforce training and related reforms as </p><p>the GSL attempts to create 2 million new jobs for the </p><p>unemployed (plus returning refugees).  Jobs will also be </p><p>needed as the military demobilizes once peace is achieved. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>...with some weaknesses </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. Post is now investigating the cases named in the AFL- </p><p>CIO\'s petition to USTR to withdraw Sri Lanka\'s GSP </p><p>privileges.  The majority of the cases concern anti-union </p><p>tactics at factories inside EPZs, which are managed by the </p><p>Board of Investment (BoI).  Information on the current </p><p>status of these cases will be forwarded in a separate cable. </p><p> </p><p>5. Areas that need improvement include allowing unions to </p><p>form in the EPZs, and a timely move into collective </p><p>bargaining with them.  Post understands that the BoI has </p><p>begun to inform potential foreign investors that union </p><p>activity in the EPZs is no longer restricted.  These words </p><p>need to be supported by actions.  Addressing the backlog of </p><p>labor cases, enforcing the Labor Commissioner\'s directives, </p><p>conducting a genuine dialogue between government, employers </p><p>and labor, and creating a social safety net are other issues </p><p>for the GSL to resolve. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Sri Lanka is justifiably proud of its reputation </p><p>for high labor standards.  In a region with forced labor, </p><p>child labor and sweatshops, there is good reason for this </p><p>pride: there are no sweatshops in Sri Lanka, and the child </p><p>labor that does exist is in the informal sector.  There are </p><p>approximately 500 active unions, some playing a powerful </p><p>role in national debates.  Problems do exist, but Post feels </p><p>they are not of the magnitude that warrant withdrawal of </p><p>GSP. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment continued: The USG has publicly committed </p><p>to stronger cooperation with and support of the Sri Lankan </p><p>government\'s peace and economic reform initiatives.  Signing </p><p>a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), promoting </p><p>bilateral trade, increasing assistance levels, and </p><p>championing the GSL\'s peace initiatives are elements of the </p><p>new relationship.  Taking away GSP privileges at this point </p><p>would send a negative and confusing signal.  Post believes </p><p>that this issue would be better handled in bilateral </p><p>discussions under the TIFA framework.  The desire of the GSL </p><p>to enter into a FTA with the US makes this forum a </p><p>particularly effective mechanism to foster change. </p><p> </p><p>Amselem </p><p></p></div>
