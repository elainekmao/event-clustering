Ozkok on TGS `discomfort\' of AKP: In a meeting with </p><p>bureau chiefs of dailies on Monday, TGS Chief General Ozkok </p><p>responded to press reports about the young military </p><p>officers\' uneasiness with the AKP government\'s `regressive\' </p><p>policies.  Gen. Ozkok condemned the report, and said there </p><p>was no such thing as `hawks\' and `doves\' in the military. </p><p>Gen. Ozkok has strongly stood against the possibility of a </p><p>military take over, papers say.  However, he also stressed </p><p>that if the reasons that had drawn military intervention in </p><p>the past emerge again, the result would be the same.  Gen. </p><p>Ozkok denied recent press reports about `orchestrated\' </p><p>cooperation between the government and military.  He openly </p><p>voiced discomfort over the AKP government\'s assignment of </p><p>fundamentalists to key bureaucratic posts, reports note. </p><p>`Not only the young officers, but the whole military is </p><p>upset with such partisan appointments,\' Gen. Ozkok said.  He </p><p>also added: `A NATO member, the Turkish army has been part </p><p>of Europe for 50 years.  Our military is not against EU </p><p>membership.  However, we believe that Turkey should join the </p><p>EU on equal conditions, and by preserving its national and </p><p>geographical unity.\'  Mainstream papers agree that Gen. </p><p>Ozkok has issued serious warnings to the AKP government. </p><p>Commenting on the Ozkok remarks, Prime Minister Erdogan said </p><p>they were part of the democratic process in Turkey, and that </p><p>everything was normal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S., Turkey relations: Dailies carried on Sunday excerpts </p><p>from Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz\'s op-ed in the </p><p>Boston Globe, in which Wolfowitz allegedly `reiterated\' his </p><p>criticism of Turkish military for failing to display </p><p>leadership during the Iraq crisis.  Wolfowitz has sent </p><p>supportive messages for the AKP government, papers claim. </p><p>Had the military encouraged the government to support the </p><p>U.S. in war with Iraq, it would have backed the new civilian </p><p>government rather than interfering in Turkey\'s international </p><p>affairs, Wolfowitz is cited as writing.  Wolfowitz said that </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul, who has read the transcript of his </p><p>interview with Turkish journalists, saw his strong support </p><p>for Turkey\'s democracy, papers note.  Meanwhile, Monday\'s </p><p>papers report recent meetings General David McKiernan held </p><p>with Iraqi political groups.  Gen. McKiernan is quoted as </p><p>saying at the meetings that he would disarm all Iraqi groups </p><p>except the Kurds, and proposed that the `peshmerge army\' </p><p>should protect Iraq\'s borders, according to papers.  Such a </p><p>`rewarding\' of Kurds drew significant reaction from Arab and </p><p>Shiite leaders, who believe the move will bring </p><p>`Lebanization\' of Iraq.  A Washington official said Gen. </p><p>McKiernan\'s decision was `controversial,\' and that it would </p><p>probably be withdrawn, says `Sabah.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A UN decision on Iraq will enable Turkey to get paid for </p><p>$1.5 billion of agreements Turkish companies have tied with </p><p>Iraq within the oil-for-food program, Sunday\'s "Hurriyet" </p><p>reports.  $948 million of the agreements are approved by the </p><p>UN, the report claims.  State Minister Kursad Tuzmen, who </p><p>had paid a controversial business trip accompanied by a </p><p>large delegation of businessmen to Iraq under Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s rule, said he saw no problem regarding the </p><p>agreements that were tied with Baghdad on that visit. </p><p>Tuzmen claimed a recent UN decision said the oil-for-food </p><p>program would be valid for six months, and that Turkish </p><p>companies should act fast to get their money. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Greek and Turkish foreign ministers, Papandreou and </p><p>Gul came together in the Greek island of Crete have worked </p><p>out `confidence building measures\' such as the exchange of </p><p>army officials and cooperation between military hospitals, </p><p>Tuesday\'s papers say.  Papandreou welcomed free passage on </p><p>Cyprus and Ankara\'s decision to allow Greek Cypriots in </p><p>Turkey without visas, while Gul called for removal of </p><p>international sanctions on Turkish Cypriots, and promised, </p><p>in exchange, additional positive steps forward from the </p><p>Turkish side.  All papers expect an end to dogfights between </p><p>Turkish and Greek pilots over the Aegean. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Eurovision Song Contest; Soccer; Plane crash: A military </p><p>plane carrying 62 Spanish peacekeepers returning from </p><p>Afghanistan crashed near Turkey\'s Black Eastern province of </p><p>Trabzon while attempting to land in thick fog on Monday, </p><p>papers report.  Spanish soldiers and the 13-memebr crew all </p><p>died in the crash. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish singer Sertab Erener won the Eurovision Song </p><p>Contest, weekend papers report.  Greek Cypriots and Greeks </p><p>contributed to Turkey\'s success by giving high points to </p><p>Erener\'s song `Every Way That I Can,\' reports underline. </p><p>Papers tie this outcome to the prevailing sympathy in </p><p>European countries for Turkey\'s defiance of U.S. in war with </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Istanbul\'s `Besiktas\' soccer club has become Turkey\'s soccer </p><p>league champion after defeating its closest rival </p><p>Galatasaray in the derby game on Sunday, all papers report. </p><p>Besiktas is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Iraq sanctions lifted </p><p>b) US-Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"United Nations of America" </p><p>Haluk Ulman argued in economic-political Dunya (5/27): "The </p><p>UNSC resolution is a declaration of the US shaping the Iraq </p><p>issue.  The resolution which passed after France and Russia </p><p>failed to block it, provides extraordinary authority to both </p><p>the US and the UK on Iraq\'s future political and economic </p><p>structure.  This means that the Bush administration has now </p><p>obtained international legitimacy which did not exist during </p><p>the Iraq operation. . The latest resolution at the UN is an </p><p>indication of France and Russia `turning themselves in\' </p><p>before the US supremacy.  Therefore the US will not be </p><p>looking for a new international organizational system in </p><p>order to have its policies approved.  From now on, the </p><p>United Nations will serve to provide approval for the </p><p>unilateral acts of the US." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tuning the relations with Washington" </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli wrote in tabloid Star (5/26): "There is </p><p>going to be an important visit from Turkey to US, --a first </p><p>after the parliamentary motion-led crisis about Iraq. </p><p>Details are still in the works for a visit by Foreign </p><p>Ministry Undersecretary Ziyal to Washington.  His mission </p><p>will be `tuning up\' the bilateral relations. . This visit is </p><p>designed to take place in a silent fashion so that a follow- </p><p>up by Foreign Minister Gul can be done.  FM Gul hopes to go </p><p>to Washington if Ziyal comes back with `continuation of </p><p>strategic partnership as well as normalization\' messages </p><p>from Washington. . The main issue for discussion during U/S </p><p>Ziyal\'s visit to Washington will be Iraq, and Turkey\'s </p><p>possible role in the rebuilding process.  The US is distant </p><p>to the idea for Turkey being part of multi-national </p><p>stability force, therefore, Turkey is very much interested </p><p>in involving economic and social projects for Iraq. . Among </p><p>other things, Turkey will offer Washington to train the </p><p>whole Iraqi police force.  Ziyal\'s visit is an important one </p><p>to eliminate `back channels\' in the bilateral relations. </p><p>And the follow up visit, when it takes place, will be even </p><p>more important." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
