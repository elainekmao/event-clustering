<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LONDON 22928 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, UK </p><p>SUBJECT:  UNITED KINGDOM:  1993 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 317207 </p><p> </p><p>1.   FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY INPUT FOR THE UK PORTION OF </p><p>THE 1993 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT TO THE CONGRESS. </p><p>RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS POSED IN PARA 4 REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.   PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG CONTINUES ACTIVELY TO PROSECUTE MEMBERS OF </p><p>     IRISH REPUBLICAN AND ULSTER LOYALIST TERRORIST </p><p>     GROUPS FOR ATTACKS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND GREAT </p><p>     BRITAIN.  SINCE OCTOBER 1992, MORE THAN 20 PERSONS </p><p>     HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR ATTACKS AND OTHER TERRORIST </p><p>     ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAIN, AND SEVERAL HUNDRED IN </p><p>     NORTHERN IRELAND. </p><p> </p><p>3.   EXTRADITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION: </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS TO OBTAIN EXTRADITION OF </p><p>     PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) CONVICTS </p><p>     JAMES SMYTH AND KEVIN ARTT FROM THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>4.   SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: </p><p> </p><p>--   INTIMIDATION OF JUDGES, JURORS AND WITNESSES HAS </p><p>     BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  AS </p><p>     A RESULT, MOST TRIALS OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS THERE </p><p>     ARE CONDUCTED WITHOUT JURIES (IN "DIPLOCK COURTS"), </p><p>     AND THE IDENTITY OF WITNESSES CAN BE WITHHELD FROM </p><p>     THE DEFENSE. </p><p> </p><p>--   QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF CONFESSION AND </p><p>     FORENSIC EVIDENCE IN TRIALS OF PIRA SUSPECTS IN </p><p>     ENGLAND IN THE 1970\'S CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE </p><p>     PROSECUTORS NOT TO BRING CASES TO TRIAL UNLESS THE </p><p>     EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING, AND MAKE JURORS RELUCTANT </p><p>     TO CONVICT.  CURRENT COURT GUIDELINES ENABLE A </p><p>     JUDGE, AT HIS DISCRETION, TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE TO </p><p>     THE DEFENSE OF ALL EVIDENCE AGAINST THE ACCUSED, </p><p>     WHETHER OR NOT IT IS INTENDED FOR PROSECUTION USE. </p><p>     POLICE HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO PROSECUTE CASES IN </p><p>     WHICH INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS MIGHT THUS </p><p>     BE COMPROMISED. </p><p> </p><p>5.   RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG COOPERATED CLOSELY WITH THE USG IN TRYING TO </p><p>     PERSUADE LIBYA TO SURRENDER FOR TRIAL THE TWO </p><p>     SUSPECTS IN THE 1988 BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 AND THE </p><p>     1989 BOMBING OF UTA 772.  IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN </p><p>     OBTAINING UNSC APPROVAL OF STRONGER SANCTIONS </p><p>     AGAINST LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG DEPLORED THE ATTACK ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER </p><p>     IN NEW YORK. </p><p> </p><p>--   BRITISH AND POLISH OFFICIALS COOPERATED IN THE </p><p>     NOVEMBER 24 INTERCEPTION IN NORTHEAST ENGLAND OF A </p><p>     HUGE CLANDESTINE ARMS SHIPMENT DESTINED FOR THE </p><p>     LOYALIST ULSTER VOLUNTEER FORCE (UVF). </p><p> </p><p>6.   MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS: </p><p> </p><p>--   ON DECEMBER 15, THE BRITISH AND IRISH GOVERNMENTS </p><p>     ISSUED A JOINT STATEMENT ON NORTHERN IRELAND, </p><p>     CALLING ON PIRA TO END ITS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>     OFFERING IT FULL PARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL </p><p>     DISCUSSIONS ON THE FUTURE OF THE PROVINCE AFTER IT </p><p>     DEMONSTRATED RENUNCIATION OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>--   POLICE AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN NORTHERN IRELAND </p><p>     CONTINUED TO CRACK DOWN ON LOYALIST AND REPUBLICAN </p><p>     PROTECTION, FRAUD, SMUGGLING, MONEY-LAUNDERING AND </p><p>     VIDEO PIRATING RACKETS.  THESE ACTIVITIES </p><p>     REPORTEDLY NOW CONSTITUTE THE MAIN SOURCES OF </p><p>     INCOME FOR TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE UK PARTICIPATES ACTIVELY IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>     COUNTERTERRORISM FORA, COORDINATING ITS ACTIVITIES </p><p>     CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. AND OTHERS.  IT ALSO PROVIDES </p><p>     COUNTERTERRORISM ASSISTANCE AND EXPERTISE TO </p><p>     NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTS ON A BILATERAL BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>7.   HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT PROVIDES NO SUPPORT FOR ANY </p><p>     INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND </p><p>     COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. IN APPLYING </p><p>     PRESSURE ON GOVERNMENTS THAT SUPPORT OR CONDONE </p><p>     TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG CONTINUES TO RESIST PRESSURE FROM OTHERS IN </p><p>     EUROPE TO RESTORE NORMAL RELATIONS WITH STATE </p><p>     SPONSORS OF TERRORISM.  IT HAS NO MISSION IN </p><p>     BAGHDAD, TRIPOLI OR PYONGYANG, AND ONLY A SKELETON </p><p>     STAFF IN TEHRAN. </p><p> </p><p>8.   STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING </p><p>COUNTRY: </p><p> </p><p>--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO SUCH STATEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>9.   SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1992 IN THE HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>--   THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCH CHANGE.  HMG REMAINS </p><p>     ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM IN ALL FORMS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SEITZ </p><p></p></div>
