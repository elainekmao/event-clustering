SECRET- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN SUMMARY. ZIMBABWEAN OFFICIALS SHARE OUR </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE CONTINUING VIOLENCE IN BURUNDI AND </p><p>RECOGNIZE THAT DIRECT MILITARY INTERVENTION UNDER THE </p><p>AEGIS OF THE UN AND/OR THE OAU MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO </p><p>AVOID ANOTHER RWANDA SITUATION.  ZIMBABWEAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY OFFICIALS WILL DISCUSS A POSSIBLE TROOP </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO A BURUNDIAN PEACEKEEPING FORCE WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE AND THEIR COLLEAGUES IN THE DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTRY.   THE ZIMBABWEANS PROMISED TO LET US KNOW ASAP </p><p>IF (AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES) THE GOZ MIGHT BE </p><p>PREPARED TO CONTRIBUTE TROOPS TO A BURUNDIAN </p><p>PEACEKEEPING FORCE.  END SUMMARY </p><p>3.  THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH ZIMBABWE\'S PERMANENT </p><p>SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS STAN CHIGWEDERE ON APRIL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>13 TO DISCUSS THE CRISIS IN BURUNDI AND TO MAKE THE </p><p>DEMARCHE CONTAINED IN REFTEL.  FOLLOWING THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S PRESENTATION, CHIGWEDERE EXPRESSED DISMAY </p><p>AT THE SITUATION IN BURUNDI AND SAID THAT THE GOZ WAS </p><p>ALSO "SERIOUSLY CONCERNED" ABOUT THE CONTINUING CYCLE OF </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THAT COUNTRY.  CHIGWEDERE SAID THAT THE </p><p>ISSUE OF BURUNDI HAS BEEN A RECENT SUBJECT OF </p><p>DISCUSSIONS AT THE MFA AND THAT HE HOPED TO GET A </p><p>PERSONAL READOUT FROM THE SOUTH AFRICA FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>FOLLOWING HIS OAU SPONSORED TRIP TO BURUNDI.  DISPLAYING </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04281  200508Z </p><p>A FAIRLY BROAD KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CURRENT BURUNDIAN </p><p>SITUATION, CHIGWEDERE PLACED MUCH OF THE BLAME ON </p><p>BURUNDI\'S TUTSI-DOMINATED MILITARY AND THE EXTREMIST </p><p>ELEMENTS IN FRODEBU. </p><p> </p><p>4.  CHIGWEDERE WELCOMED OUR CONSULTATIONS ON THE BURUNDI </p><p>ISSUE AND AGREED WITH OUR ASSESSMENT THAT WE MUST TRY TO </p><p>DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PREVENT ANOTHER RWANDA. </p><p>CHIGWEDERE ALSO AGREED THAT A CREDIBLE THREAT AND/OR </p><p>ACTUAL USE OF A MILITARY PEACEKEEPING FORCE MIGHT BE THE </p><p>ONLY WAY TO PREVENT OR CONTAIN A MAJOR ERUPTION OF </p><p>VIOLENCE IN BURUNDI. </p><p> </p><p>5.  CHIGWEDERE SAID HE AND HIS MFA COLLEAGUES WOULD </p><p>RAISE THE TROOP ISSUE AT A HIGH LEVEL IN THE DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTRY AND ALSO WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE.  HE SAID HE </p><p>WOULD NOT PREJUDGE ANY DECISION, BUT WOULD GET BACK TO </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR AS SOON AS HE HAD ANY HARD NEWS ON </p><p>WHETHER THE GOZ WOULD BE PREPARED TO COMMIT ANY TROOPS. </p><p>CHIGWEDERE URGED THE AMBASSADOR TO RAISE THE BURUNDI </p><p>ISSUE WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE DURING THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>FORTHCOMING PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS CEREMONY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH THE GOZ IS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT THE BLOODLETTING IN BURUNDI, IT IS DIFFICULT TO </p><p>PREDICT HOW THE ZIMBABWEANS WILL REACT ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p>ON THE PLUS SIDE, THEY HAVE RESPONDED FAVORABLY TO A </p><p>NUMBER OF PEACEKEEPING REQUESTS AND ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>COMMITTED TO SENDING A BATTALION TO ANGOLA.  HOWEVER, ON </p><p>THE NEGATIVE SIDE, ZIMBABWE\'S COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE </p><p>TROOPS TO THE ANGOLAN PEACEKEEPING OPERATION, THE LACK </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04281  200508Z </p><p>OF GOZ FUNDS TO SUPPORT ANOTHER MILITARY OPERATION, AND </p><p>A LACK OF FINANCIAL OR MATERIAL SUPPORT FROM THE U.S. </p><p>MAY DETER THE ZIMBABWEANS FROM GETTING INVOLVED IN </p><p>BURUNDI.  WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS ARE RELYING </p><p>ON BRITISH LOGISTICAL SUPPORT FOR THEIR FORTHCOMING </p><p>OPERATIONS IN ANGOLA. </p><p>CARSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
