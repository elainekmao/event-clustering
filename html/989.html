(C) LUIS REYES WAS APPOINTED VENEZUELA\'S MINISTER OF </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE BY PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ.  THE NEWLY CREATED </p><p>MINISTRY OF INFRASTRUCTURE WILL OVERSEE MATTERS OF TRANSPORT, </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT.  REYES WAS FORCIBLY RETIRED </p><p>FROM THE VENEZUELAN AIR FORCE AS A LIEUTENANT COLONEL AFTER HIS </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE NOVEMBER 27, 1992, COUP ATTEMPT.  REYES IS A </p><p>PERSONAL FRIEND OF CHAVEZ.  CHAVEZ\'S COMMENT THAT "(REYES) IS AN </p><p>HONEST MAN WITH GREAT MANAGERIAL ABILITY, AND AN UNYIELDING </p><p>PATRIOT" INDICATES CONFIDENCE IN THE NEW MINISTER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>MILITARY AND ACADEMIC BACKGROUND </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) BORN IN BARINAS IN 1953, REYES IS A PILOT AND AERONAUTICAL </p><p>ENGINEER.  HE JOINED THE AIR FORCE IN 1970.  REYES WAS ONE OF FOUR </p><p>VENEZUELAN AIR FORCE OFFICERS INVITED BY THE UNITED STATES AIR </p><p>FORCE IN 1974 TO ATTEND AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE COURSE AT LACKLAND AIR </p><p>FORCE BASE IN TEXAS, AND A ONE-YEAR UNDERGRADUATE PILOT TRAINING </p><p>COURSE AT MOODY AIR FORCE BASE IN GEORGIA.  AFTER RETURNING TO </p><p>VENEZUELA, REYES PURSUED UNIVERSITY STUDIES IN BARQUISIMETO, </p><p>VENEZUELA, AND GRADUATED WITH AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  HE BECAME A LIEUTENANT COLONEL IN 1982.  HE </p><p>TRAVELED TO THE UNITED STATES IN 1988 TO ASSUME A POSITION IN THE </p><p>DIRECTORATE OF INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS OF THE VENEZUELAN AIR FORCE </p><p>(FAV).  HE RETURNED TO VENEZUELA IN NOVEMBER 1991, THREE MONTHS </p><p>BEFORE THE COUP ATTEMPT OF FEBRUARY 4, 1992.  AT THAT TIME, HE </p><p>SERVED AS THE CHIEF OF INVESTIGATION ON A CASE INVOLVING A </p><p>VENEZUELAN AIR FORCE GENERAL WHO WAS EVENTUALLY CONVICTED OF </p><p>CORRUPTION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAVEZ </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PRESIDENT CHAVEZ\'S CONFIDENCE IN REYES COMES FROM MANY </p><p>YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP.  REYES AND CHAVEZ GREW UP IN THE SAME TOWN, </p><p>ATTENDED THE SAME O\'LEARY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND PLAYED BASEBALL ON </p><p>CONTENDING TEAMS.  BOTH REYES AND CHAVEZ JOINED THE MILITARY -- </p><p>REYES THE AIR FORCE AND CHAVEZ THE ARMY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) REYES WAS AN EARLY CONSPIRATOR WITH CHAVEZ.  REYES TOLD THE </p><p>EL UNIVERSAL NEWSPAPER THAT HE VIVIDLY RECALLS A DISCUSSION HE HAD </p><p>WITH CHAVEZ ON DECEMBER 17, 1977, AFTER RETURNING FROM THE U.S.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT CHAVEZ AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW CORRUPTION HAD DISTORTED </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES.  FOLLOWING THIS DISCUSSION </p><p>REYES INCORPORATED HIMSELF IN CHAVEZ\'S CONSPIRACY.  BEGINNING IN </p><p>1982, REYES WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF COORDINATING THE FAV\'S ACTIONS IN </p><p>THE THEN FUTURE COUP ATTEMPTS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN "THE CONSPIRACY" </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) REYES DID NOT PART IN THE FEBRUARY 4, 1992, COUP ATTEMPT. </p><p>INSTEAD, AS THE PERSON CHARGED WITH COORDINATING THE FAV\'S ACTIONS </p><p>IN THE COUP ATTEMPT, REYES MANAGED TO PREVENT THE FAV FROM RISING </p><p>AS A COUNTER-INSURRECTION FORCE.  REYES EXPLAINED, "(SINCE) THE </p><p>CONTINUITY (OF THE MILITARY) HAD BEEN BROKEN,...WE DECIDED TO </p><p>NEUTRALIZE THE AIR FORCE AT THAT TIME."  REYES WAS ARRESTED AND </p><p>DETAINED ONE AND A HALF MONTHS AS A RESULT OF HIS INACTION DURING </p><p>THE FEBRUARY 4 COUP ATTEMPT.  AFTER HIS RELEASE, REYES BECAME ONE </p><p>OF THE LEADERS OF THE NOVEMBER 27, 1992, AIR FORCE-LED COUP </p><p>ATTEMPT.  HIS PARTICIPATION WAS MARKED BY FLYING A F-16 AT MACH 1 </p><p>SPEED OVER THE CITY OF CARACAS.  THE FLIGHT REPORTEDLY BROKE </p><p>WINDOWS IN MANY PARTS OF THE CITY.  REYES SAID HE BROKE THE SOUND </p><p>BARRIER TO FRIGHTEN THE ENEMY FORCES.  THE COUP ATTEMPT FAILED AND </p><p>REYES WAS IMPRISONED FOR 14 MONTHS AT FORT TIUNA, THE MILITARY </p><p>HEADQUARTERS IN CARACAS.  REYES REMAINED ALLIED TO CHAVEZ\'S </p><p>MOVEMENT AND WAS LATER APPOINTED AS CHAVEZ\'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN </p><p>COORDINATOR IN LARA STATE IN 1998. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>NEW RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) REYES WILL HEAD UP THE MINISTRY OF INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH </p><p>WILL CONSOLIDATE THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION (MTC) </p><p>AND THE MINISTRY OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT (MINDUR).  THIS "SUPER- </p><p>MINISTRY" WILL BE CHARGED WITH ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO AIR, LAND, </p><p>AND WATER TRANSPORT, ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE, PUBLIC HOUSING, </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AND "WHITE ELEPHANT" PROJECTS (PROJECTS LEFT </p><p>UNFINISHED BY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS).  INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS </p><p>PERTAINING TO OTHER MINISTRIES WILL ALSO BE CENTRALIZED IN THE </p><p>MINISTRY.  REYES PLANS TO DIVIDE THE MINISTRY\'S RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>AMONG THREE SECRETARIATS, ONE EACH FOR TRANSPORT, COMMUNICATION, </p><p>AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT.  HE ALSO INTENDS TO INCREASE THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES OF INDEPENDENT AGENCIES RELEVANT TO THE FUNCTIONS </p><p>OF THE MINISTRY.  REYES SAID HE ACCEPTED THE POSITION AS MINISTER </p><p>OF INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE OF THE "PERSONAL CHARGES GIVEN TO HIM BY </p><p>THE PRESIDENT."  REYES HAS ALREADY MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION ON THE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY, WHICH WELCOMED HIS VIEWS ON DECENTRALIZATION OF </p><p>THE MINISTRY AND INCREASED MARKET LIBERALIZATION AS A "PLEASANT </p><p>SURPRISE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>THE "MINI-MINISTRO\'S" GOALS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) REYES DOES NOT WANT TO BE KNOWN AS "SUPER-MINISTRO," BUT </p><p>PREFERS THE TITLE OF "MINI-MINISTRO."  HE BELIEVES IN </p><p>DECENTRALIZATION OF THE MINISTRY\'S FUNCTIONS AND WANTS TO CREATE A </p><p>SMALLER, MORE EFFICIENT MINISTRY.  HE SAYS DECENTRALIZATION IS A </p><p>GOOD WAY TO RID A LARGE BUREAUCRACY OF CORRUPTION.  ONE OF REYES\' </p><p>PRIMARY GOALS IS TO SECURE FAA CATEGORY I FLIGHT SAFETY STATUS FOR </p><p>VENEZUELA.  AIRPORTS THAT DO NOT MEET REQUIRED STANDARDS WILL BE </p><p>CLOSED DOWN.  REGULATIONS WILL BE ENFORCED AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR AIRPORTS WILL HAVE TO COMPLY.  REYES DOES NOT LEAVE </p><p>OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PRIVATIZING AIRPORTS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) REYES CONSIDERS THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR TO BE A </p><p>STRATEGIC SECTOR.  HE WANTS TO CONTINUE OPENING THE SECTOR, AND </p><p>MOVE UP THE DATE FOR TERMINATING THE NATIONAL TELEPHONE COMPANY, </p><p>CANTV\'S, MONOPOLY.  AT AN INVESTMENT MEETING HELD IN MID-JANUARY, </p><p>REYES PLEDGED TO REVAMP THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY AGENCY, </p><p>CONATEL, TO MAKE IT LESS DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL.  REYES </p><p>HOPES TO ATTRACT PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT VIA CONCESSIONS TO </p><p>REVISE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS FRAMEWORK (SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) REYES WANTS TO HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE PROPER </p><p>UPKEEP OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION; HAVE THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT </p><p>SECRETARIAT CONSTRUCT MORE PUBLIC SPACE (RATHER THAN JUST PUBLIC </p><p>HOUSING); ATTRACT PRIVATE INVESTMENT FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION; AND </p><p>REACTIVATE THE VENEZUELAN MERCHANT MARINE BY HAVING PRIVATE </p><p>COMPANIES TAKE ON VENEZUELAN FLAG VESSELS.  HE IS A REALIST WHEN IT </p><p>COMES TO WHITE ELEPHANT PROJECTS.  HE ATTRIBUTES THE STATUS OF </p><p>THESE PROJECTS TO THE OVER-AMBITION OF PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS, </p><p>WITH NO REGARD FOR THE ACTUAL FUNDING AVAILABLE.  REYES INTENDS TO </p><p>COMPLETE SOME PROJECTS, BUT ONLY AS MANY AS THE BUDGET PERMITS. </p><p>REYES SAID THE MOST FEASIBLE PROJECTS TO FINISH WOULD BE THE </p><p>HIGHWAY FROM SAN FELIPE TO PUERTO CABELLO, THE BYPASS NORTH OF </p><p>BARQUISIMETO, AND A SECTION OF THE HIGHWAY LEADING FROM CARACAS TO </p><p>THE EASTERN REGION OF VENEZUELA. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>REYES AS AN HONEST MAN </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON REYES\' PERSONAL </p><p>CHARACTER.  HOWEVER, PRESIDENT CHAVEZ CHARACTERIZED HIM AS AN </p><p>"HONEST MAN" WHEN HE WAS APPOINTED.  A SENIOR EXECUTIVE IN A </p><p>VENEZUELAN COMMERCIAL AIRLINE TOLD EMBOFF THAT SEVERAL VENEZUELAN </p><p>MILITARY OFFICERS WHO KNOW REYES UNIFORMLY DESCRIBED HIM AS </p><p>"STRICT, HONEST, AND INTELLIGENT."  THE EXECUTIVE ALSO REPORTED </p><p>THAT REYES SAID TO HIM, "I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP...I NEED AN HONEST </p><p>OPINION ABOUT AVIATION ISSUES," BECAUSE HE EXPECTS TO BE APPROACHED </p><p>BY NUMEROUS INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING SPECIAL INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) REYES\' APPOINTMENT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF CHAVEZ\'S </p><p>ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN SINCE THE MINISTRY OF INFRASTRUCTURE WILL </p><p>ABSORB THE MTC, WHICH IS WELL-KNOWN FOR ITS INEFFICIENCY AND </p><p>CORRUPTION.  REYES\' ACCESS TO CHAVEZ AND HIS HONESTY PROVIDE THE </p><p>CREDIBILITY HE WILL NEED TO CHANGE THE OLD WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS </p><p>IN THE NEW MINISTRY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
