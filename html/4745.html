<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 005415 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC, NEA/ARP, AND NEA/NGA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/MAC/AME </p><p>USDOC FOR 3131/USFCS/OIO/ANESA </p><p>USDOE FOR IE - L.COBURN AND C.WASHINGTON </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ETRD, PREL, KU, SA, QA, IR, ENRG EINV </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT ACTING OIL MINISTER ON PROJECT KUWAIT, </p><p>QATARI GAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 5019 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 5296 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Acting Minister of Oil Sheikh Ahmed Fahed Al-Sabah told </p><p>the Ambassador on December 14 that he and the government </p><p>remain committed to Project Kuwait (reftel A), and said that </p><p>he intends to secure parliamentary approval for the project </p><p>before the current session of Parliament ends, during his </p><p>term as Minister.  When Ambassador noted that U.S. and other </p><p>international oil companies are losing patience, the Minister </p><p>said it was his intention to work simultaneously with oil </p><p>companies and the National Assembly to polish the draft </p><p>agreements while securing passage of authorizing legislation. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The Ambassador also asked about the status of the </p><p>agreement with Qatar for natural gas supplies, and </p><p>specifically the pipeline to transit Saudi and Bahraini </p><p>waters.  The Minister suggested that nothing was happening at </p><p>the moment, and when the Ambassador asked if there was a role </p><p>for the US to play, the Minister said the Saudis have said </p><p>"don\'t do anything."   The Minister inferred that the SAG </p><p>just wants to let the situation alone for some time to let </p><p>everyone cool off.  He added that it\'s not just Saudi Arabia; </p><p>Qatar also has its problems with Bahrain (and Kuwait itself) </p><p>over Al-Jazeera. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Minister said that the indefinitely delayed </p><p>delivery of Qatari gas should have no significant impact on </p><p>Kuwait.  The Minister noted that Kuwait intends to proceed </p><p>with the development of the offshore Dorra field, and that </p><p>this coupled with new wells in Rawdatain should provide </p><p>sufficient gas for Kuwait\'s near-term needs.  When the </p><p>Ambassador asked if Iran was being considered as a source of </p><p>supply, the Minister acknowledged that Kuwait had discussed </p><p>the matter with the Iranians, but quickly noted that they had </p><p>discussed many similar projects in the past.  The Minister </p><p>stated flatly Kuwait had no serious intentions of purchasing </p><p>Iranian gas. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  The Minister\'s oft repeated message that </p><p>Project Kuwait is \'just around the corner\' is received again </p><p>with hope, but not much optimism.  We found his statement </p><p>that he wanted to get it done during his term as Minister </p><p>interesting in that it seems he does not expect to be Oil </p><p>Minister in the next cabinet.  As for his strategy of </p><p>double-tracking talks with oil companies and the National </p><p>Assembly, we\'ve heard this before.  We still have not seen an </p><p>adequate explanation as to why the GOK continues to wait, or </p><p>a commitment to launch this strategy on a date certain and </p><p>see it through to the end.  End comment. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
