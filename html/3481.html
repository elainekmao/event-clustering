<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001827 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, EAGR, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: JUSTICE FOR AGRICULTURE -- TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 1819 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary. Laboff attended the inaugural meeting of </p><p>the JAG on Tuesday, August 6.  This group was formed by some </p><p>of the more confrontational members of the Commercial Farmers </p><p>Union (CFU) in response to CFU members\' perception that the </p><p>organization was too conciliatory.  The initial act of JAG </p><p>was to file suit against the GOZ on behalf of commercial </p><p>farmers, citing multi-billion dollar damages.  Claiming a </p><p>mandate originating from the Universal Declaration of Human </p><p>Rights as adopted by Zimbabwe, JAG purports to represent the </p><p>interests of commercial farm owners, farm workers, and </p><p>agricultural ancillary industries, and proclaims the mission </p><p>of securing justice, peace and freedom for the agricultural </p><p>sector.  In actuality, the main purpose of the JAG seems to </p><p>be publicizing developments in the ongoing land struggle in </p><p>the hope of spurring somebody -- whether Zimbabweans or </p><p>outside interests -- to intervene in the continuing </p><p>destruction of the commercial agricultural sector.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The membership of the JAG comprises a wide variety </p><p>of constituencies:  farmers who seek more confrontation with </p><p>the GOZ, member of various civic groups, community activists, </p><p>and public relations specialists.  The emergence of a </p><p>confrontational group at this stage of the game is indicative </p><p>of the deep divisions between members of the CFU as to the </p><p>best way of addressing the disaster which has decimated their </p><p>industry.  Some reports indicate that the farmers who have </p><p>embraced JAG include those whose views are skewed far to one </p><p>side as well as those who have already been forced off their </p><p>land and have nothing more to lose.  According to contacts </p><p>within the CFU, the parent organization has chosen not to </p><p>deal with JAG because the CFU remains committed to dialogue, </p><p>and any suggestion of complicity will taint their posture of </p><p>continued cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The tone of the inaugural meeting of JAG was defiant </p><p>yet determined.  Several speakers addressed the crowd, which </p><p>numbered about fifty participants from various groups -- </p><p>commercial farmers, civic society, and the diplomatic corps. </p><p>The first speaker, a local attorney, sympathized with the </p><p>goals of the group but delivered a </p><p>good-luck-you\'re-going-to-need-it message.  He bluntly told </p><p>the group that regardless of whether or not their litigation </p><p>was successful, the GOZ would not recognize a judgment since </p><p>President Mugabe has already announced that the government </p><p>will only honor judgments which it determines to be </p><p>appropriate.  Given the long and painful process of land </p><p>acquisition and reallocation, it is incredibly unlikely that </p><p>the GOZ would actually pay out in accordance with a judicial </p><p>determination that the program was flawed.  However, the </p><p>advocate supported both the legal right and the moral </p><p>obligation of JAG to proceed with a judicial challenge. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The second speaker, an economist, outlined the </p><p>cataclysmic impact that the chaotic land acquisition exercise </p><p>is having on the economy as a whole.  According to his </p><p>perspective, the government must "spend a large fortune in </p><p>order for \'resettled farmers\' to earn a small fortune."  Of </p><p>course, there is no indication of where the necessary funds </p><p>-- conservatively estimated to run at over Zim $300 billion, </p><p>or over US $434 million, annually -- will be found. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The final speaker was the director of Amani Trust, </p><p>who acknowledged that widespread famine, which would </p><p>significantly affect displaced farm workers, was the </p><p>inevitable result of the mismanaged "agrarian reform" </p><p>program.  He premised his presentation on the theory that </p><p>famines do not happen in the absence of bad governance, and </p><p>stated his belief that since the ruling party was not </p><p>demonstrably incompetent, they must be governing badly with </p><p>the intention of subverting the "democracy process."  He </p><p>reiterated the oft-heard refrain that the way forward </p><p>required civil society to recognize the political </p><p>illegitimacy of the ruling party, to demand constitutional </p><p>reforms, and to hold free and fair elections. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment:  One eloquent comment from a member of the </p><p>Zimbabwe branch of Transparency International, a good </p><p>governance group, noted that in order to move forward, civil </p><p>society must address the problem in context.  Specifically, </p><p>he stated that civil society needed to address how commercial </p><p>farming emerged in Zimbabwe, as well as why a return to </p><p>small-scale peasant farming will no longer work in the 21st </p><p>century.  Other than this well-accepted observation, most of </p><p>the presentations covered familiar ground.  Although many </p><p>members of JAG seemed energized by the fact that they were </p><p>finally responding and doing something -- anything -- there </p><p>seemed to be a muted realization that whatever steps they </p><p>took were ultimately too little and too late.  End comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
