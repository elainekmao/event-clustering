<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 03204 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PREL, IR, IZ, SY, TU, UR </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRANIANS IN DAMASCUS AND NOTES FROM TEHRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  A RECENT VISIT OF FAMILY FRIENDS FROM TEHRAN FILLED </p><p>IN SOME GAPS IN OUR INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF IRANIAN </p><p>TOURIST-PILGRIM FLIGHTS TO DAMASCUS AND PRODUCED SOME </p><p>COMMENTS ON THE SITUATION IN TEHRAN.  THE FLIGHTS OF </p><p>JUMBO JETS FROM TEHRAN, WHICH USED TO BRING 2,500 </p><p>IRANIANS TO DAMASCUS EACH WEEK, WERE INTERRUPTED IN </p><p>MARCH WHEN IRAQ WARNED AIRLINES TO AVOID IRANIAN </p><p>AIRSPACE.  FLIGHTS FROM TEHRAN HAVE GRADUALLY RESUMED </p><p>DURING THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT </p><p>SYRIAN AIR WILL ALSO SOON HAVE PLANES ON THE TEHRAN RUN. </p><p>IRANIAN AIR FLIGHTS PROCEED FROM TEHRAN TO MESHED AND </p><p>NORTH INTO THE SOVIET UNION AND OVER TURKEY TO </p><p>SYRIA -- FOUR HOURS IN ALL.  SEATS FROM TEHRAN ARE </p><p>NOW EXTREMELY SCARCE WITH FAMILIES OF MARTYRS HAVING </p><p>PRIORITY.  FOR SOME REASON -- POSSIBLY NEW FLIGHTS -- </p><p>SEATS ARE NOW AVAILABLE FOR THE RETURN FROM DAMASCUS </p><p>TO TEHRAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  EACH IRANIAN BEFORE LEAVING IRAN IS ALLOWED TO </p><p>EXCHANGE AT THE OFFICIAL RATE THE EQUIVALENT OF $100 </p><p>FOR WHICH HE RECEIVES CASH THAT MUST BE EXCHANGED </p><p>FOR SYRIAN CURRENCY AT THE AIRPORT ON ARRIVAL.  HAVING </p><p>PAID THE EQUIVALENT IN TEHRAN, HE IS GIVEN A VOUCHER </p><p>FOR AN ADDITIONAL $400 AT THE TOURIST RATE, WHICH CAN </p><p>BE PICKED UP AT THE SEMIRAMIS HOTEL IN DAMASCUS.  BUS </p><p>TRANSPORTATION FROM TEHRAN TAKES FOUR DAYS, ONE OF WHICH </p><p>IS SPENT ON FRONTIER FORMALITIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IRANIAN TOURISTS OFTEN SUPPLEMENT THEIR CASH BY BRING- </p><p>ING GOODS WITH THEM FROM TEHRAN.  THE CAVIAR SUPPLY HAS </p><p>BEEN CUT DOWN, HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF RECENT RESTRICTIONS </p><p>AT TEHRAN AIRPORT WHERE PURCHASES BY RELIGIOUS PILGRIMS ARE </p><p>CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE.  IRANIAN VISITORS SHOP IN </p><p>DAMASCUS FOR SOUVENIRS AND ITEMS NOT AVAILABLE IN </p><p>TEHRAN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  RELIGIOUS DUTIES CONSIST OF VISITING THE SHRINE IN </p><p>THE OMAYYAD MOSQUE IN DAMASCUS WHERE HUSSEIN\'S HEAD IS </p><p>BURIED.  MORE IMPORTANT FOR MOST IS THE VISIT TO THE </p><p>DAMASCUS SUBURB WHERE SIT ZAYNAB, SISTER OF HUSSEIN </p><p>AND HASSAN, IS BURIED.  ACCORDING TO TRADITION, ZAYNAB </p><p>WAS BROUGHT TO DAMASCUS AT THE SAME TIME AS HUSSEIN\'S </p><p>HEAD.  HER SHRINE IS SELDOM MENTIONED IN TOURIST </p><p>LITERATURE AND WAS, UNTIL THE IRANIAN INFLUX, SCARCELY </p><p>EVER VISITED.  HOWEVER, SINCE IRAN IS THE RESTING PLACE </p><p>OF ONLY ONE OF THE TWELVE IMANS AND IRAQ, RICH IN SHI\'A </p><p>REMAINS, IS OUT OF BOUNDS, SIT ZAYNAB\'S TOMB HAS </p><p>ACQUIRED A NEW PROMINENCE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ALTHOUGH A SIMILAR SHRINE IN IRAN OR IRAQ WOULD NOT </p><p>BE OPEN TO NON-MOSLEMS, SYRIAN TOLERANCE PREVAILS HERE, </p><p>WITH THE ONLY WARNING IN ENGLISH BEING:  "MAKE UP LADIES </p><p>ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER."  BLACK CHADORS ARE AVAILABLE </p><p>AT THE OUTER GATE WHERE THERE IS NO ENTRY FEE.  THE </p><p>ARCHITECTURAL STYLE IS PERSIAN, BUT THE MODERN SQUARE </p><p>TILES WILL NEED MANY YEARS TO DEVELOP CHARACTER.  THE </p><p>INNER  SANCTUM IS IN THE IRANIAN TRADITION, HEAVILY </p><p>DECORATED WITH MIRRORED CEILING AND SILVER GRILL AROUND </p><p>THE TOMB. THE SCENE INSIDE THE ENCLOSURE COULD BE FROM </p><p>AN ORIENTALIST PAINTING, WITH WOMEN IN CHADORS AND MEN </p><p>IN TURBANS AND LONG GARMENTS.  THERE WERE ONLY A FEW </p><p>PERSONS WHO LOOKED LIKE REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS IN MILITARY </p><p>UNIFORM DURING OUR VISIT ON A SATURDAY DURING NOON </p><p>PRAYERS.  THERE ARE NO PICTURES OF KHOMEINI ANYWHERE TO </p><p>BE SEEN IN THE SHRINE AREA OR THE NEARBY STREETS.  THIS </p><p>COULD HARDLY BE ACCIDENTAL AND PROBABLY REFLECTS A SYRIAN </p><p>REQUIREMENT.  (ASAD\'S PICTURE IS ALSO ABSENT.) </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENTS BY OUR PROFESSIONAL AND MERCHANT CLASS </p><p>VISITORS ABOUT THE SITUATION IN TEHRAN AGREED WITH OTHER </p><p>RECENT REPORTS REGARDING A GROWING MALAISE AS THE PUBLIC </p><p>AWAITS THE END OF THE KHOMEINI ERA.  WHETHER RUMOR OR </p><p>FACT, OUR FRIENDS REPORTED FREQUENT MANIFESTATIONS OF </p><p>ANTI-REGIME FEELING, INCLUDING WALL SLOGANS AND BOMBINGS </p><p>THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED IN THE MEDIA.  THEY ALSO </p><p>SPOKE OF CONSIDERABLE USE OF ALCOHOL AMONG THE PUBLIC, </p><p>WITH OPIUM THE PREFERRED DRUG OF THE CLERGY.  MONTAZERI, </p><p>WHO IS REPORTEDLY A HEAVY USER, IS DISMISSED AS A NOBODY. </p><p>PREDICTIONS RE KHOMENEI\'S SUCCESSOR CENTER ON RAFSANJANI. </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE WAR IS ALSO REPORTEDLY STRONG AND </p><p>GROWING STRONGER.  THOUGH OUR VISITORS DID NOT SEEM TO </p><p>BELIEVE CLERICAL RULE HAD A LONG-TERM FUTURE IN IRAN, </p><p>THEY COULD NOT SUGGEST WHEN OR HOW THE RETURN TO A MORE </p><p>TRADITIONAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT WOULD OCCUR. THE ONLY </p><p>POSITIVE THING THEY HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE KHOMEINI REGIME </p><p>WAS THAT IT HAD, FOR THE TIME BEING, SUBDUED THE TUDEH </p><p>PARTY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EAGLETON </p><p></p></div>
