<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001867 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: GOJ BRACES FOR COUNTRYWIDE ANTI-WAR </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN JORDAN AFTER FRIDAY PRAYERS AND BEYOND </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm. Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PUBLIC RAGE SIMMERING FOR A WEEK </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Although the coalition\'s military actions against Iraq </p><p>started a week ago, this Friday will be the first time that </p><p>Jordanians will congregate for Friday prayers and express </p><p>their pent up frustrations with the "US aggression" after </p><p>watching events unfold on t.v. all week.  Adding to the </p><p>heightened emotions will be today\'s burial in Irbid </p><p>governorate, north of Amman, of the four Jordanian students </p><p>killed near Mosul while trying to flee Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZED DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The GOJ has been negotiating with the main protest </p><p>organizers all week (the Islamic Action Front and the </p><p>professional associations chief among them).  Amman, Jerash, </p><p>Salt, Irbid and Ramtha are just some of the cities where </p><p>government authorized anti-war demonstrations are planned </p><p>after Friday prayers tomorrow, with other demonstrations </p><p>occurring on Sunday, March 30.  Authorized demonstrations are </p><p>also planned at some of the Palestinian refugee camps </p><p>scattered throughout Jordan.  While the GOJ recognizes the </p><p>need to allow the public to vents its anger, Jordan\'s Public </p><p>Security Department (PSD) is very concerned that such </p><p>demonstrations (or spontaneous unauthorized protests </p><p>elsewhere) could turn violent after a week of people seeing </p><p>Iraq bombed and innocent civilians dying. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  All expectations are that Friday will serve as a test </p><p>of the PSD\'s crowd control abilities, and the government\'s </p><p>overall dexterity at crafting a message that acknowledges </p><p>popular anger while maintaining order. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
