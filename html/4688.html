<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002293 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, AND INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. </p><p>MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 12-12-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PINS, CE, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka:  Muslim leader Rauf Hakeem\'s </p><p>problems come into tighter focus </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 2277, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  With his party fragmenting around him, </p><p>Rauf Hakeem of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) </p><p>finds himself in a very precarious position.  While he </p><p>is respected in Colombo circles for his support of the </p><p>peace process, Hakeem is considered a lightweight </p><p>politician.  The fact that he is not from the east where </p><p>a plurality of Sri Lankan Muslims live is also a serious </p><p>liability.  With his political survival at stake, Hakeem </p><p>has to make a comeback soon or face probable </p><p>marginalization.  Another factor hurting Hakeem is the </p><p>emerging view that it might not be bad for the peace </p><p>process if he is cut out of the scene.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>================ </p><p>Hakeem in a Bind </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Rauf Hakeem, the leader of the SLMC, finds </p><p>himself in a very precarious position.  (Note:  Hakeem </p><p>also serves the governing coalition as Minister of Ports </p><p>and Shipping.)  As reported in Reftels, his party has </p><p>recently fragmented into hostile camps, one remaining </p><p>loyal to his authority and the other rejecting him out </p><p>of hand.  Both factions appear relatively evenly </p><p>balanced, although Hakeem seems to be able to rely on </p><p>the support of a bare majority of the party\'s 12 MPs and </p><p>SLMC governing committee members. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) If the dispute is not settled in some way soon, </p><p>Hakeem will be tested in coming weeks (and perhaps </p><p>months) in the court system, as party dissidents </p><p>continue their effort to remove him as party leader. </p><p>(Note:  The next legal hearing is scheduled for </p><p>December 13 in Colombo.  Party dissidents, who assert </p><p>that Hakeem has abused his power, claim that they </p><p>removed Hakeem as leader on December 1 per proper SLMC </p><p>procedure.)  Aside from the legal case against him, </p><p>Hakeem is also being challenged politically:  As </p><p>reviewed in Reftels, he is under attack in the press by </p><p>his rivals virtually every day.  In addition, we have </p><p>been told by contacts that party dissidents are trying </p><p>to rally the populace against Hakeem in Muslim areas in </p><p>the Eastern Province.  (Note:  Hakeem has also been </p><p>touring the east trying to garner support.) </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>A Lightweight Politician </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) It is not clear that Hakeem is up to the </p><p>challenge he is facing.  Most contacts agree that Hakeem </p><p>is polite, thoughtful, and intelligent.  In Colombo </p><p>circles, the mild-mannered Hakeem is also respected for </p><p>his support of the peace process.  (Note:  His main SLMC </p><p>opponent, MP A.L.M. Athaulla, is basically against the </p><p>GSL\'s peace initiative -- see below.)  That said, </p><p>Hakeem\'s recent problems have solidified his reputation </p><p>as being essentially a lightweight politician, lacking </p><p>the leadership skills required to succeed in the rough- </p><p>and-tumble world of Sri Lankan politics. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In respect to leadership skills, Hakeem has also </p><p>been compared unfavorably to the founder of the party, </p><p>M.H.M. Ashraff, who died in a helicopter crash in </p><p>October 2000.  (Note:  Hakeem assumed control of the </p><p>party in early 2001, after winning a fierce leadership </p><p>battle.)  Ashraff was seen as a strong, charismatic </p><p>leader, who could reach out to the common man.  Hakeem, </p><p>however, is widely seen as somewhat aloof and lacking in </p><p>energy.  (Note:  In meetings with Mission officers, he </p><p>sometimes appears listless.)  This lack of political </p><p>verve and ability to articulate his views to the party </p><p>faithful, coupled with his apparent inability to cut </p><p>political deals, has left many observers wondering </p><p>whether Hakeem has the tools to survive as SLMC leader. </p><p> </p><p>=================== </p><p>The Eastern Problem </p><p>=================== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The fact that Hakeem is not from the east where </p><p>a plurality of Sri Lankan Muslims live is also coming </p><p>into clearer focus as a serious liability.  (Note: </p><p>Hakeem, 42, is from central Sri Lanka, but has spent </p><p>much of his life in Colombo.  Up to 40 percent of Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s Muslims live in the Eastern Province.)  With the </p><p>peace process focusing inexorably on possible GSL-Tamil </p><p>Tiger power-sharing arrangements, the multi-ethnic east </p><p>is correctly considered the thorniest issue needing </p><p>settlement.  Many eastern Muslims simply do not trust </p><p>Hakeem to negotiate for them, seeing him has too willing </p><p>to compromise with the government and the Tigers. </p><p>Indeed, Hakeem\'s pro-peace process views are generally </p><p>at odds with those held by many eastern Muslims, who are </p><p>deeply skeptical of Tamil Tiger intentions. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In addition, Hakeem\'s personal characteristics </p><p>--as touched on above--are off-putting to many </p><p>easterners, who find him too urbane and totally unlike </p><p>the roughhewn, "man-of-the-people" politicians they are </p><p>used to dealing with.  (Note:  Hakeem, a natty dresser, </p><p>is wealthy and was educated in Sri Lanka\'s best schools. </p><p>Muslims in the east, however, are generally poorer than </p><p>their co-religionists elsewhere in Sri Lanka.  Many of </p><p>them are farmers and fishermen.)  Again, Hakeem\'s </p><p>failings raise the specter of Ashraff, who was from the </p><p>east, and was extremely popular with Muslims in that </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) With his political survival at stake, Hakeem has </p><p>to make a comeback soon or face probable </p><p>marginalization.  Thus far, the odds do not look good, </p><p>although Hakeem has been in some tight spots before and </p><p>gotten out of them.  (Note:  There remains the </p><p>possibility that the two sides may work out some sort of </p><p>settlement.  Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has weighed </p><p>in, urging compromise.)  Another factor hurting Hakeem </p><p>is the emerging view that it might not be bad for the </p><p>peace process if he is cut out of the scene.  While this </p><p>perspective is a bit ironic given Hakeem\'s pro-peace </p><p>process stance, Hakeem is probably not the deus ex </p><p>machina needed to bring eastern Muslims on board with </p><p>the peace process.  The problem is finding someone who </p><p>can play that role -- and it is not clear anyone in the </p><p>Muslim community can.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
