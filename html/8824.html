(C) Post delivered 6/15 ref A talking points and </p><p>background paper to the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs, </p><p>and faxed a courtesy copy to Central Bank FIU Chief </p><p>Abdulrahim Al-Awadi.  Post received 6/17 a diplomatic note </p><p>from the MFA requesting official copies in Arabic of all </p><p>designation lists, from ref B designation of "Batasuna And </p><p>The Basque Fatherland And Liberty" onward. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Action request: As a matter of protocol, the </p><p>Central Bank in recent months has encouraged us to submit </p><p>terrorist financing designations directly to the MFA. </p><p>Consequently, it not unusual that the MFA would require an </p><p>official translation of the designation list, as the </p><p>majority of our written communication with the MFA is in </p><p>Arabic.  Although Post has limited translation </p><p>capabilities, we will endeavor to provide a translation of </p><p>these demarches and plan to note to the MFA that Post\'s </p><p>transliterations of the names of designated individuals and </p><p>entities should not be viewed as authoritative.  We will </p><p>defer to the MFA and the UAE Central Bank to determine the </p><p>alternate spelling of these names consistent with the </p><p>UAEG\'s computerized lists of bank accounts.  Department </p><p>please advise.  End action request. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
