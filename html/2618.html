EXCERPTS FOLLOW: </p><p> </p><p>   "AGAINST ALL ODDS, ZIMBABWEANS TURNED OUT IN THEIR </p><p>   THOUSANDS TO VOTE IN THE THREE-DAY PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>   POLL. . .  THE PROPHETS OF DOOM, WHO WERE </p><p>   PREDICTING VIOLENCE AND MAYHEM DURING THE ACTUAL </p><p>   VOTING PROCESS, HAVE BEEN PUT TO SHAME AS </p><p>   ZIMBABWEANS CONDUCTED THEMSELVES IN A MOST </p><p>   EXEMPLARY MANNER.  ALMOST THE ENTIRE WESTERN WORLD </p><p>   WAS BANKING ON A CATASTROPHE HAPPENING IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>   WITH DEAD BODIES LITTERING THE STREETS, GUN-TOTING </p><p>   MILITIAS PATROLLING THE SUBURBS AND A STATE OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00667  01 OF 02  140608Z </p><p>   EMERGENCY PREVAILING IN THE COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>   HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER STORY HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A </p><p>   DAMP SQUIB AS ZIMBABWEANS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A </p><p>   MATURE DEMOCRATIC DISPENSATION.  THERE WAS A LOT OF </p><p>   ANTICIPATION THAT THE CLOSER OF POLLING ON MONDAY </p><p>   NIGHT BEFORE SOME PEOPLE HAD VOTED, AFTER THE </p><p>   EXTENSION, WOULD TRIGGER AN ORGY OF VIOLENCE.  BUT </p><p>   THAT FAILED TO MATERIALIZE, FURTHER DAMPENING THE </p><p>   EXPECTATIONS OF BRITAIN, THE U. S. AND THE EU, </p><p>   AMONG OTHERS, WHO HAVE BEEN DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR </p><p>   AN EXCUSE TO DISCREDIT ZIMBABWE\'S ELECTION.  THE </p><p>   AMERICANS EVEN WENT TO THE EXTENT OF ISSUING TWO SO- </p><p>   CALLED STRONG WARNINGS AGAINST THE RULING ZANU PF </p><p>   GOVERNMENT FOR THE ALLEGED DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF </p><p>   URBAN VOTERS AND THE QUESTIONING OF SOME AMERICAN </p><p>   DIPLOMATS BY THE POLICE.  THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO </p><p>   BASIS FOR ISSUING SUCH WARNINGS EXCEPT WHAT WE SEE </p><p>   AS A NAKED ATTEMPT TO CREATE A SITUATION.  THIS </p><p>   ALSO REVEALS GROWING DESPERATION BY THE WEST AS IT </p><p>   FAILS TO INFLUENCE EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE. . .IT IS </p><p>   INDEED AN INSULT TO ALL ZIMBABWEANS TO BE TOLD WHAT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2056 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00667  02 OF 02  140608Z </p><p>ACTION INR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    A-00     ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DS-00    EUR-00   UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  IRM-00   TEST-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      IIP-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------74459C  140608Z /38 </p><p>P 140558Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 1204 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p>AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LILONGWE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000667 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR SWANN, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI </p><p>FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OCII, ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ZIMBABWE DECIDES; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>   TO DO BY THE AMERICANS WHOSE OWN ELECTIONS LEFT A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00667  02 OF 02  140608Z </p><p>   LOT TO BE DESIRED AND COULD NEVER STAND ANYWHERE IN </p><p>   THE WORLD AS A MODEL OF DEMOCRACY OR FREE AND FAIR </p><p>   ELECTIONS.

WE THINK NOT.  WHAT THIS SIMPLY </p><p>   SHOWS IS THAT THE WESTERN WORLD IS UNASHAMEDLY </p><p>   TRYING TO PICK A FIGHT WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>   GOVERNMENT BUT HAS SO FAR FAILED TO FIND ANY </p><p>   JUSTIFIABLE REASON TO DO SO.  THAT IS WHY THEY ARE </p><p>   CLUTCHING AT ALMOST ANYTHING, NO MATTER HOW </p><p>   TRIVIAL, TO THREATEN THE COUNTRY.  THE TURNOUT IN </p><p>   THIS ELECTION HAS SENT CLEAR SIGNALS TO THE WESTERN </p><p>   WORLD THAT ZIMBABWE IS NOT A COLONY AND WILL NOT BE </p><p>   SWAYED BY SUCH BLATANT THREATS.  IN DENIGRATING THE </p><p>   ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT THE WESTERN WORLD DOES NOT </p><p>   SEEM TO REALIZE IS THAT IT DIRECTLY INSULTING THE </p><p>   PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE.  THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE TURNED </p><p>   OUT IN THEIR HUGE NUMBERS TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT </p><p>   THEY CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED AND WILL STAND BY </p><p>   THEIR LEADERSHIP, WHICH THEY VOTED INTO POWER TO </p><p>   LEAD AND GUIDE THEM." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
