<p>S E C R E T COLOMBO 000447 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/IP/SA, DS/DSS/ITA AND SA/INS </p><p>ISLAMABAD PLEASE PASS LAHORE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  1.6 X1, X6 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AEMR, PTER, CASC, CE, MIssion Security </p><p>SUBJECT:  COLOMBO EAC MEETING MARCH 17, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) Colombo 399, (B) STATE 69234 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by S.V. Wright, Regional Security </p><p>Officer, reason 1.5 (C) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On March 17, 2003 Colombo Emergency Action </p><p>Committee (EAC) met to further discuss development of our </p><p>security posture as we approach probable conflict in Iraq. </p><p>Ambassador chaired the EAC. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The Ambassador informed the EAC of his request </p><p>that the Sri Lanka police provide armed officers at all </p><p>official residences.  RSO added that he had met with the </p><p>Inspector General of Police and obtained his agreement to </p><p>provide the officers.  The EAC (though cognizant of the </p><p>potential management difficulties armed officers might </p><p>present) approved the recommendation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) The DCM briefed the EAC on the status of Iraqi </p><p>intelligence and other personnel in Sri Lanka (reftel A). </p><p>The DCM reported that the GSL decided it would not expel </p><p>Iraqi officers, but opted instead to call in the Iraqi </p><p>Charge.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs met with the Iraqi </p><p>Charge on March 14 and told him in that inappropriate </p><p>activity would be dealt with harshly.  In addition, the GSL </p><p>has imposed a visa requirement on all Iraqi nationals. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The committee agreed to several other steps to </p><p>take effect on the day of conflict in Iraq: </p><p> </p><p>- On the day conflict begins, Post 1 will issue an "all- </p><p>call" on the Embassy E&E network.  All American staff will </p><p>be instructed to stay home.  The four Embassy LAVs will be </p><p>dispatched to the residences to pick up essential Embassy </p><p>staff.  An EAC will be convened that morning.  LAVs will be </p><p>used to pick up all Americans on subsequent days until the </p><p>EAC decides otherwise.  (DATT and IBB will use their LAVs to </p><p>transport their respective employees.) </p><p> </p><p>- All dependant children will be kept home from school on </p><p>the first day of the conflict.  Subsequently, a local guard </p><p>mobile patrol will escort both school busses to the Overseas </p><p>School. </p><p> </p><p>- The Consular section will suspend visa services on the </p><p>first day in order to focus on U.S. citizen services. </p><p>Consular will also forward the warden message to all Amcits </p><p>in country consistent with the language provided in reftel B. </p><p> </p><p>- Travel to the Eastern part of Sri Lanka will once again </p><p>be restricted until the EAC can gauge public sentiment in </p><p>that part of the country. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The EAC also discussed the issue of USAID and </p><p>Embassy PSC American staff.  The EAC will discuss whether to </p><p>include PSC staff in the LAV transportation and Sri Lanka </p><p>police coverage only after the conflict begins and public </p><p>reaction is measured. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The EAC agreed to meet again as needed. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
