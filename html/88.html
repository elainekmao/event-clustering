<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIRUT 04372 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, KPAL, SY, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  SIDON:  ANOTHER "WAR OF THE CAMPS" IN THE OFFING? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  DAMASCUS 4580 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  SIX WEEKS AFTER </p><p>ISRAEL ANNOUNCED THE COMPLETION OF ITS MILITARY </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTH LEBANON, THAT REGION </p><p>REMAINS TENSE AND UNSETTLED.  ALTHOUGH RELIABLE, </p><p>FIRST-HAND REPORTS ARE SPARSE, IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT </p><p>POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE SITUATIONS CONTINUE TO </p><p>PREVAIL IN SIDON AND JAZZIN.  TROUBLES LINGER </p><p>ALONG THE BORDER STRIP BUT APPEAR TO HAVE </p><p>DIMINISHED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN SIDON, INCREASED FEARS OF AN OPEN CONFLICT </p><p>INVOLVING PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIANS, THE PNSF, AMAL, </p><p>LOCAL MUSLIM MILITIAS, AND PERHAPS THE PSP HAVE </p><p>LED TO SYRIAN-SPONSORED EFFORTS TO HEAD OFF ANY </p><p>SUCH SHOWDOWN AND TO AVERT ANOTHER "WAR OF THE </p><p>CAMPS."    MEANWHILE, SYRIA IS REPORTEDLY </p><p>BOLSTERING THE AMAL MILITIA WITH ADDITIONAL </p><p>EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF DOUBTS </p><p>ABOUT THE STEADFASTNESS OF ITS OTHER ALLIES. </p><p>END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE LOCAL PRESS AND MOST OF OUR LEBANESE </p><p>POLITICAL CONTACTS ARE REPLETE WITH STORIES THAT </p><p>TENSIONS ARE ESCALATING IN SIDON.  THESE STORIES </p><p>ARISE, IN PART, FROM REPORTS THAT PLO LEADER </p><p>ARAFAT IS REINFORCING HIS LOYALISTS IN THE THE AYN </p><p>AL-HILWAH AND MIYAH MIYAH REFUGEE CAMPS AND IN </p><p>SIDON PROPER WITH ADDITIONAL MEN AND MATERIEL. </p><p>ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT CONFIRM OR QUANTIFY THESE </p><p>REINFORCEMENTS, THE LEADERS OF SIDON ARE, WE HEAR, </p><p>EXTREMELY EDGY" ABOUT THE ESCALATING TENSIONS </p><p>THERE AND THE PROSPECTS FOR A FLARE-UP SIMILAR TO </p><p>THE "WAR OF THE CAMPS" IN BEIRUT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS REPORTS, IN EARLY </p><p>JULY, SYRIAN TROOPS IN EASTERN LEBANON FORCED THE </p><p>PRO-ARAFAT "BADR BATTALION" OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>LIBERATION ARMY OUT OF THE BIQA\', WHERE IT HAD </p><p>BEEN SINCE 1982, AND BACK TO JORDAN.  THE PRESS </p><p>ALSO CITED REPORTS FROM CAIRO THAT ARAFAT HAD </p><p>PERSUADED THE GOE TO ALLOW HIM TO TRANSFER A PLA </p><p>UNIT, THE AYN JALUT BRIGADE, FROM EGYPT TO SOUTH </p><p>LEBANON.  ON JULY 18, MUSTAFA SA\'AD\'S "POPULAR </p><p>NASSERITE ORGANIZATION" CLAIMED TO HAVE </p><p>INTERCEPTED TWO SHIPMENTS OF ARMS DESTINED FOR THE </p><p>CAMPS AND TO HAVE CAPTURED THE SMUGGLERS, WHO WERE </p><p>IDENTIFIED AS FOUR PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIANS BEARING </p><p>JORDANIAN PASSPORTS.  IN A "RADIO MONTE CARLO" </p><p>INTERVIEW, SIDON MP NAZIH BIZRI SAID THE TWO </p><p>CONTAINERS OF ARMS HAD BEEN SENT FROM JORDAN VIA </p><p>THE NORTHERN LEBANESE PORT OF TRIPOLI.  MOST </p><p>RECENTLY, ON JULY 23, AN ISRAELI NAVAL VESSEL </p><p>FIRED ON AND SET ABLAZE A HONDURAN-REGISTERED </p><p>FREIGHTER IN SIDON HARBOR.  ALTHOUGH RELIABLE </p><p>DETAILS ARE SPARSE, THE CARGO VESSEL WAS EVIDENTLY </p><p>SUSPECTED OF CARRYING ARMS; ITS MOVEMENTS WERE </p><p>DESCRIBED BY ISRAELI RADIO AS "SUSPICIOUS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  ON THE GROUND, THE RECENT ESCALATION OF </p><p>TENSIONS IN SIDON HAS SO FAR BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY </p><p>STILL RELATIVELY MINOR SHIA VS. PALESTINIAN </p><p>CLASHES.  (WE HAVE SEEN NO RECENT REPORTS OF </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CLASHES BETWEEN LEBANESE SHIA AND </p><p>SUNNI IN SIDON, THOUGH ANIMOSITIES BETWEEN THEM </p><p>RUN HIGH.)  AMAL AND PNSF FIGHTERS CLASHED BRIEFLY </p><p>ON JULY 15 WHEN THE LATTER ATTEMPTED TO REOCCUPY </p><p>PREVIOUSLY EVACUATED POSITIONS NEAR AYN AL-HILWAH </p><p>CAMP.  OTHER AMAL-PALESTINIAN CLASHES OCCURRED THE </p><p>SAME DAY NEAR BA\'LABAKK AND ON JULY 21 AT THE BURJ </p><p>AL-BURAJINAH CAMP IN BEIRUT.  ON THE NIGHT OF JULY </p><p>22-23, SHIITE-PALESTINIAN TENSIONS ALSO SURFACED </p><p>IN TYRE, WHERE AMAL FORCES ENCIRCLED BASS REFUGEE </p><p>CAMP, FOLLOWING THE SHOOTING OF AN AMAL MILITIAMAN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  FACED WITH PERSISTENT SHIITE-PALESTINIAN AND </p><p>BROADER SHIITE-SUNNI TENSIONS IN VARIOUS AREAS OF </p><p>LEBANON, SYRIA APPEARS TO BE GOING TO CONSIDERABLE </p><p>LENGTHS TO PUSH ITS ALLIES --- BOTH LEBANESE AND </p><p>PALESTINIAN --- TO AVERT A REPETITION IN SIDON OF </p><p>A BEIRUT-STYLE "WAR OF THE CAMPS." </p><p> </p><p>8.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FINAL COMMUNIQUE OF THE </p><p>SYRIAN-SPONSORED CONFERENCE OF JULY 8-9, LEBANESE </p><p>MUSLIM LEADERS DECLARED THEY WOULD NOT TOLERATE </p><p>THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRE-1982 SITUATION IN </p><p>LEBANON, WHEN THE PLO WAS VIRTUALLY A STATE WITHIN </p><p>A STATE.  THEY SPECIFICALLY SAID THEY WOULD NOT </p><p>ALLOW THE "SEDITION" WHICH HAD PREVAILED IN BEIRUT </p><p>AND ITS PALESTINIAN CAMPS TO EXTEND TO SIDON. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE DAMASCUS CONFERENCE, </p><p>AND REPORTEDLY WITH SYRIAN VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>KHADDAM\'S BACKING, PRO-SYRIAN PARTIES ANNOUNCED A </p><p>PLAN TO FORM A "NATIONAL ALLIANCE FRONT," ONE OF </p><p>WHOSE OBJECTIVES WOULD BE TO AVOID FRICTIONS IN </p><p>SIDON.  THE FRONT WOULD INCLUDE, INTER ALIA, NABIH </p><p>BARRI\'S AMAL MOVEMENT, WALID JUMBLATT\'S "NATIONAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC FRONT," AND THE "NATIONAL POLITICAL </p><p>COUNCIL" OF SIDON, WHICH IS CHAIRED BY NAZIH BIZRI </p><p>AND INCLUDES MUSTAFA SA\'AD\'S "POPULAR NASSERITE </p><p>ORGANIZATION." </p><p> </p><p>10.  CONCOMITANTLY, SYRIA HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN </p><p>TRYING TO ACHIEVE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE AMAL </p><p>AND THE PNSF.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, KHADDAM </p><p>ARRANGED A MEETING IN DAMASCUS ON JULY 9 BETWEEN </p><p>BARRI AND PNSF LEADERS WHICH JUMBLATT ALSO </p><p>ATTENDED.  ON JULY 12, THE MAIN PRO-SYRIAN GROUPS </p><p>IN SIDON --- AMAL, THE NATIONAL POLITICAL COUNCIL, </p><p>THE POPULAR NASSERITE ORGANIZATION, AND THE </p><p>ISLAMIC SOCIETY --- AND THE PNSF ISSUED A JOINT </p><p>STATEMENT GIVING ARAFAT\'S SUPPORTERS IN SIDON ONE </p><p>WEEK TO LEAVE THE CITY.  THE STATEMENT </p><p>SPECIFICALLY BRANDED FOUR INDIVIDUALS AS "SYMBOLS </p><p>OF ARAFAT\'S CAPITULATIONIST POLICY":  ABDEL AZIZ </p><p>ABU FADAH, RAJI AL NAJMAH, HUSSEIN AL HAIBI, AND </p><p>MOEMEN. </p><p> </p><p>11. MOST RECENTLY, ON JULY 22-24, SYRIAN VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT KHADDAM HOSTED A LARGE MEETING OF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PNSF, THE NATIONAL </p><p>POLITICAL COUNCIL OF SIDON, AMAL, AND THE NATIONAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC FRONT.  ACCORDING TO BANNER REPORTS IN </p><p>THE BEIRUT PRESS, THIS DAMASCUS MEETING RESULTED </p><p>IN THE APPROVAL OF A PNSF PROPOSAL TO FORM A MIXED </p><p>COMMITTEE TO "REDEFINE ON PAPER" LEBANESE- </p><p>PALESTINIAN RELATIONS.  AS FOR SIDON ITSELF, THE </p><p>CONFEREES ADOPTED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR (A) THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF ALL ARMED PALESTINIAN ELEMENTS FROM </p><p>THE CITY AND A PROMISE NOT TO ORGANIZE NIGHT </p><p>PATROLS IN THE SUBURBS; (B) THE WITHDRAWAL OF AMAL </p><p>MILITIAMEN FROM THE SECTOR EXTENDING FROM RMAYLAH </p><p>TO THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE OF SIDON; (C) THE NDF TO </p><p>TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTAINING ORDER IN THE </p><p>CITY AND CONTROLING ACCESS ROADS, UNDER THE </p><p>SUPERVISION OF THREE SYRIAN ARMY OFFICERS; AND </p><p>(D) A "POLITICAL CONTROL COMMISSION" CHAIRED BY </p><p>KHALID JUMBLATT AND COMPRISING NAZIH BIZRI, ANWAR </p><p>FATAYRI, INAAM RAAD, AND USSAMA SA\'AD. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE MAJOR QUESTION WHICH REMAINS UNANSWERED </p><p>IS WHAT THE LINE-UP WILL BE WHEN AND IF SERIOUS </p><p>FIGHTING ERUPTS IN SIDON.  AS NOTED ABOVE, SYRIA </p><p>IS APPARENTLY PUSHING HARD FOR ITS LEBANESE ALLIES </p><p>--- BE THEY SHIA, SUNNI, OR DRUZE --- AND THE PNSF </p><p>TO STAND FIRM AGAINST THE PRO-ARAFAT PALETINIANS. </p><p>WE AND MANY OBSERVERS HERE, HOWEVER, BELIEVE THAT </p><p>FIGHTING WOULD MOST LIKELY ERUPT BETWEEN AMAL AND </p><p>THE ARAFATISTS AND THAT THE PNSF FORCES WOULD </p><p>QUICKLY JOIN IN SUPPORT OF THEIR PALESTINIAN </p><p>BRETHREN AGAINST THE LEBANESE SHIA.  THIS SCENARIO </p><p>WOULD MIRROR THAT OF THE "WAR OF THE CAMPS" IN </p><p>BEIRUT IN WHICH PRO AND ANTI-ARAFATISTS COMBINED </p><p>FORCES AGAINST THE SHIA. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE ROLE OF THE SIDONESE SUNNI MILITIAS IS </p><p>LESS PREDICTABLE.  WOULD THEY FIGHT AS LEBANESE, </p><p>I.E., WITH THE SHIA AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS? </p><p>WOULD THEY FIGHT AS SUNNI, I.E., WITH THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS AGAINST THE SHIA?  OR WOULD THEY TRY </p><p>TO REMAIN NEUTRAL?  WE AGREE WITH REFTEL THAT, FOR </p><p>NOW, BIZRI AND SA\'AD HAVE PERHAPS SEIZED UPON AN </p><p>ANTI-ARAFATIST STANCE AS A LOW-COST WAY TO PLEASE </p><p>THE SYRIANS.  ONCE FIGHTING BEGINS, HOWEVER, WE </p><p>ARE FAR FROM CERTAIN THAT THE SUNNI WILL CONTINUE </p><p>THIS LINE.  SHIITE-SUNNI TENSIONS IN SIDON, AS IN </p><p>WEST BEIRUT, RUN HIGH, AND WE RECALL THAT DURING </p><p>THE "WAR OF THE CAMPS" THE REMNANTS OF THE SUNNI </p><p>MURABITUN MILITIA JOINED WITH THE PALESTINIANS TO </p><p>MAKE NIGHTTIME RAIDS ON AMAL AND PREDOMINANTLY </p><p>SHIITE LAF 6TH BRIGADE POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE PSP REMAINS ANOTHER WILD CARD.  AS THE </p><p>"WAR OF THE CAMPS" IN BEIRUT PROCEEDED, THE </p><p>DRUZE-SHIA ALLIANCE BECAME INCREASINGLY STRAINED, </p><p>AND, AS FIGHTING IN WEST BEIRUT EARLIER THIS MONTH </p><p>DEMONSTRATED, TENSION BETWEEN AMAL AND THE PSP </p><p>CONTINUES TO RUN VERY HIGH.  AN ADDITIONAL </p><p>COMPLICATING FACTOR IS THAT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND </p><p>SUNNI MILITIAMEN HAVE REPORTEDLY JOINED THE PSP </p><p>SINCE THE DEFEAT OF THE MURABITUN MILITIA IN APRIL. </p><p> </p><p>15.  FACED WITH THE PROSPECT THAT THE SUPPOSEDLY </p><p>PRO-SYRIAN PNSF, POPULAR NASSERITE ORGANIZATION, </p><p>AND PSP MAY, IN FACT, SIDE WITH THE PRO-ARAFAT </p><p>PALESTINIANS OR AT LEAST AGAINST AMAL, SYRIA HAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY BEGUN TO REINFORCE THE AMAL MILITIA </p><p>WITH ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING (SEE DATT </p><p>SEPTEL).  DURING THE APRIL 16-17 "BATTLE OF </p><p>BEIRUT" AND THEN THE "WAR OF THE CAMPS," THE AMAL </p><p>MILITIA\'S WEAKNESSES AND LIMITATIONS WERE </p><p>EXPOSED.  SYRIA IS NOW APPARENTLY TRYING TO </p><p>BOLSTER THE STRENGTH OF ITS MOST RELIABLE ALLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LYNE </p><p></p></div>
