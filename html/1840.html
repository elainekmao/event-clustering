<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001932 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/15/2001 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, NI, PREL, MASS, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO TO VISIT CHINA </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason:  1.5(b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Mission has learned that the much-discussed but </p><p>never-before-scheduled State Visit to China of Nigerian </p><p>President Olusegun Obasanjo is now slated for late August. </p><p>President Obasanjo plans to leave Nigeria on August 25, and </p><p>depart China on August 29, arriving in Nigeria on August 30. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Chinese nationals have long been active in </p><p>manufacturing in Nigeria, notably in textiles and plastic </p><p>products.  More recently, a wider range of Chinese (and other </p><p>East Asian origin) low-cost consumer goods has become </p><p>available in Nigeria -- often to the consterntion of domestic </p><p>manufacturers who cannot compete effectively.  Chinese firms </p><p>in the engineering sector (onshore seismic operations in </p><p>oil-producing areas and large civil engineering projects in </p><p>Abuja (CCECC) and telecommunications are also establishing </p><p>strong profiles here.  The Chinese have also sought to </p><p>establish a presence in the sale of defense-related articles. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
