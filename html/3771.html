<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 005412 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR ADVOCACY CENTER -- CHRIS JAMES </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>PASS EXIMBANK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, EFIN, EAIR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: BOEING PRESENTS "AGGRESSIVE" FINAL OFFER TO ROYAL </p><p>JORDANIAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  The Boeing Company, which has been in </p><p>negotiations with Jordanian national carrier Royal Jordanian </p><p>Airlines (RJ) for the purchase and leasing short-haul aircaft </p><p>in competition with Airbus, presented its final offer to the </p><p>airline September 19.  The offer marks the climactic stage </p><p>after over a year of negotiations.  Boeing officials were </p><p>cautiously optimistic, but concerned that Airbus may yet </p><p>attempt to undercut the deal.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>IT\'S NOT OVER TILL IT\'S OVER </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Boeing\'s negotiating team of Samir Hanna, Senior </p><p>Sales Manager, Edward Schachle, Regional Director, and Peter </p><p>Ledger, local Boeing representative presented what it termed </p><p>its final offer to RJ CEO Samer Majali September 19.  The </p><p>deal features the sale of five 737s and the leasing of </p><p>another four of the aircraft.  Airbus, which recently leased </p><p>four A-340s to RJ, is also in negotiation to sell a like </p><p>number of A-320s. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Characterizing the offer as "very aggressive", </p><p>Boeing officials filled us in on the details September 19. </p><p>The offer includes a discount of 39.9% off the "sticker" </p><p>price, an advance payment schedule beginning at 20%, rather </p><p>than the usual 30%, $10 million to top off the resale price </p><p>of RJ\'s existing A-320s, a spare parts exchange program worth </p><p>$3.2 million, and another $3.4 million in training support, </p><p>manuals, and manual revisions.  All this in addition to the </p><p>performance features of the 737 which make it "clearly </p><p>superior" to the A-320. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Expecting the RJ CEO to be a bit more enthusiastic </p><p>upon receipt of the Boeing proposal, Hanna said "Majali was </p><p>not displeased".  He said the substance of the Boeing message </p><p>was that the company was doing "everything it can" to work </p><p>with RJ, and that this was the best deal they could offer. </p><p>He stressed the company would not get into a price war with </p><p>Airbus.  Hanna said that the concessions they were making </p><p>were "extremely special", on terms they generally do not </p><p>offer to customers who buy 30 planes. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Hanna said that both offers would now be considered </p><p>by the RJ board, expected to meet sometime between now and </p><p>the end of the month.  Majali told the team a decision would </p><p>be made the first week of October.  He suggested there might </p><p>be another round of negotiations, saying that it\'s "not over </p><p>till it\'s over".  Despite this, Hanna reiterated that this </p><p>was their best offer.  Hanna added that he thought Airbus </p><p>would be very surprised at the aggressiveness of the Boeing </p><p>deal. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>FINANCING COULD BE A DEAL BREAKER </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Hanna said EXIM assistance could help nail down the </p><p>deal.  He said he suspected that Majali had already "got </p><p>something from the French" on the financing side to help fund </p><p>the purchase, and was seeking something similar from Boeing. </p><p>He said that both the airline and the Jordanian government </p><p>were adamant about not providing sovereign guarantees given </p><p>RJ\'s status as a self-sustaining "corporatized" entity that </p><p>is seeking a foreign investor partner. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
