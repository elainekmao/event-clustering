<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002793 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF/PD and EUR/ERA KATHY ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PTER, NI, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIAN MEDIA REACTION TO BUSH UNGA SPEECH, </p><p>USG POLICY TOWARD IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL:  A) State 184783  B) State 177841 </p><p>C) State 169974 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Nigerian press coverage surrounding </p><p>President Bush\'s September 12 speech to the UN General </p><p>Assembly and ongoing debate over U.S. policy towards </p><p>Iraq has been largely overshadowed by domestic </p><p>political news and the ongoing impeachment battle </p><p>between President Obasanjo and the legislature. </p><p>Northern media outlets whose audiences are </p><p>predominantly Muslim have been more sharply critical of </p><p>potential U.S. action against Iraq than those based in </p><p>the South, with strong skepticism expressed at USG </p><p>arguments on the need to remove the Iraqi President. </p><p>However, even Southern media generally voiced </p><p>criticism.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigerian Media Reaction to Bush UNGA Speech, Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Nigerian press coverage of President Bush\'s </p><p>September 12 address to the UN General Assembly was </p><p>spotty and largely confined to the international news </p><p>sections rather than the front page.  Radio and </p><p>television coverage of the international debate over </p><p>Iraq has been light.  Nigeria news outlets are far more </p><p>focused on domestic issues such as the ongoing </p><p>political battle between President Obasanjo and the </p><p>legislative branch over possible impeachment, upcoming </p><p>elections and the aftermath of voter registration, and </p><p>economic stories of interest to the average Nigerian. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Reporting on the Bush speech, subsequent remarks, </p><p>and USG policy towards Iraq in the southern newspapers </p><p>has been straightforward, relying on wire service </p><p>material and direct quotes from world leaders but no </p><p>editorial or analytical pieces.  Coverage has focused </p><p>on European and international resistance to any USG </p><p>unilateral action against Iraq.  Coverage in the </p><p>Northern papers, while still confined to the </p><p>international news sections, has given greater play to </p><p>USG policy towards Iraq and has been more critical. </p><p>Northern papers such as the "New Nigerian," the "Weekly </p><p>Trust," and "The Triumph" have also provided strongly </p><p>worded editorials denouncing USG policy towards Iraq. </p><p>Post notes that some of the material published in these </p><p>news organs is coming from web sites (e.g., </p><p>IslamOnline.net) geared towards Muslim audiences. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Criticisms and observations of USG policy have </p><p>centered on the following themes: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  USG policy on Iraq represents anti-Islamic bias of </p><p>USG since 1970s when U.S. hostages taken in Iran; in </p><p>post-Cold War period, U.S. sees Islam as greatest </p><p>threat to U.S. domination of world political and </p><p>economic life and USG Middle East policy geared towards </p><p>containment/weakening of Muslim states.  " . . . with </p><p>the collapse of socialism in the former Soviet Union, </p><p>the U.S. finds Islam and Muslim nations as her greatest </p><p>enemy, looking for a slight opportunity to unleash </p><p>terror on them . . . \' "The Triumph,"  September 15-16, </p><p>2002; an article entitled, "Before America\'s Second </p><p>Crusade." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  U.S. "set up" (i.e., encouraged) Saddam Hussein to </p><p>invade Kuwait so that they could destroy Iraqi ability </p><p>to develop a strong, independent Iraq that would not </p><p>bend to USG policies in the Middle East.  "  It was </p><p>decided, therefore, that the USA, backed up by Israel, </p><p>should attack and destroy the military capabilities of </p><p>Iraq, thereby forcing the capitulation of Islamic </p><p>radicalism; . . . the female American Ambassador to </p><p>Baghdad at the time misled Saddam Hussein into </p><p>believing that American would not raise a finger, </p><p>should the Iraqi Army invade the disputed territories </p><p>in Kuwait,"  "New Nigerian," September 13, 2002; an </p><p>article entitled, "Bush\'s Obsession." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  WMD argument lacks substance, adequate proof and </p><p>relies more on suspected intentions of Iraq rather than </p><p>hard evidence; is also a double standard in that USG is </p><p>not applying same policy of regime change to other </p><p>states holding WMD (e.g., North Korea, Israel, etc.); </p><p>USG is also a possessor of WMD.  " . . . America is </p><p>looking the other way over Israel\'s nuclear weapons." </p><p>"The Comet," September 23, 2002; an article entitled </p><p>"Iraq and the Future of the UN." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  U.S. military used depleted uranium in bombs </p><p>dropped during Gulf War; depleted uranium did far more </p><p>damage to Iraqi people and U.S. soldiers than Iraqi use </p><p>of bio/chem. weapons.  " . . .  these shells, besides </p><p>being extremely destructive, were found in many cases </p><p>to cause cancer and other severe illnesses, not among </p><p>Iraqi troops but also among U.S. soldiers who were </p><p>around the areas where they were dumped or used . . . </p><p>Iraqi rates of cancer in the aftermath of the Gulf War </p><p>have gone up over 50 percent is some regions.  This, </p><p>combined with US-led efforts to keep medicine out of </p><p>Iraq has exacerbated the situation and overwhelmed </p><p>doctors in Baghdad, Mosul and Basra," "Weekly Trust," </p><p>September 13-19, 2002; an article entitled, "US vs. </p><p>Iraq:  Whose war is it anyway?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Argument that Iraq has ignored UN resolutions also </p><p>represents a double standard in that Israel has ignored </p><p>UN resolutions but the USG has not made similar demands </p><p>of Tel Aviv.  " . . . why should the US continue to </p><p>turn its searchlight on Muslim nations as those </p><p>harboring terrorists while the biggest terror of the </p><p>world, Israel, who defies every bit of UN resolution in </p><p>the Middle East peace process carries on with its </p><p>ruthless, bloodsucking campaign against the harpless </p><p>(sic) Palestinians?"  "The Triumph," September 13, </p><p>2002; an article entitled, "September 11, US and </p><p>Muslims." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  President Bush is carrying on family vendetta </p><p>against Saddam Hussein and the USG policy towards Iraq </p><p>has not evolved since 1991.  "  . . . the Bush family </p><p>would never be contented unless the Iraqi President is </p><p>disgraced out of office through defeat in a war with </p><p>America."  "Sunday Vanguard," September 15, 2002; an </p><p>article entitled, "The Wars of the Bushmen." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Iraq\'s neighbors (other than Israel) have not </p><p>voiced concern over any danger posed by Iraq; USG </p><p>showing its pro-Israel bias vis-`-vis rest of Middle </p><p>East.  "Many Arab nations have flocked to Baghdad to </p><p>show solidarity with Saddam Hussein."  "Weekend </p><p>Triumph," September 28, 2002; an article entitled, </p><p>"Opening the Gates of Hell." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  USG public diplomacy strategy on Iraq could </p><p>usefully address the foregoing criticisms by focusing </p><p>on themes such as USG support and assistance levels for </p><p>Middle Eastern countries, USG past practice/willingness </p><p>to work multilaterally on Mideast problems, Iraq\'s use </p><p>of WMD on its own people, neighbors, how use of WMD has </p><p>affected the environment/health of Iraqi people/what </p><p>their use by Iraq today could mean, rationale for </p><p>following differing policy on Iraq as opposed to other </p><p>WMD holders, balance between Israeli and Palestinian </p><p>interests, differences in the USG approach to Iraq </p><p>between 1991 and today, and more specific information </p><p>linking the Iraq leadership with terrorist </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
