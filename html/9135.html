<p>S E C R E T SANAA 001590 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, PTER, ETTC, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN: LATEST WEAPONS BUYBACK CACHE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (c) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  During a July 1 telcon, President Saleh informed </p><p>Ambassador that Yemen is actively engaged in </p><p>non-proliferation efforts and instructed Brigadier General </p><p>Ali Shater to coordinate a viewing of ROYG proceeds from the </p><p>past few months of weapons buyback collection efforts. </p><p>Shater later invited Ambassador Hull, accompanied by a team </p><p>of USG experts of his choosing (namely FBI, DAO, CIA, etc.) </p><p>to visit the Yemeni Special Forces Camp on the morning of </p><p>July 2nd. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  Upon entering the hanger, the Embassy team, </p><p>comprised of the Amb, DATT, ORCA, and POL, observed that the </p><p>items displayed were different than those seen in late </p><p>January 2003.  The ordinance, on the whole, was older and </p><p>included items not previously displayed, including: </p><p> </p><p>--  SAM-18s </p><p>--  Strella 2 </p><p>--  Strella 3 </p><p>--  AT-7 </p><p>--  RPGs </p><p>--  plastique </p><p>--  blasting caps </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  Although expected, Brigadier General Ali Shater </p><p>was not present.  The overview and tour was given by General </p><p>Yahya Abdullah.  Ambassador noted that it is important to </p><p>continue these collection efforts, especially in light of </p><p>recent events in Abyan and Riyadh.  When asked about the </p><p>disposition of the previous buyback proceeds, Abdullah said </p><p>that useable ordinance was incorporated into Ministry of </p><p>Defense stockpiles, while surplus items were destroyed. </p><p>Abdullah agreed to allow Post to view the destruction in the </p><p>future, which would be more systematic, noting that in the </p><p>past ROYG destruction efforts had been piecemeal. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Ambassador said that the USG would like to have a </p><p>DIA team visit Yemen to assist ROYG to inventory past and </p><p>future collection efforts.  (Comment: This offer was </p><p>previously rejected by Brigadier General Shater in April </p><p>2003.  End comment.)  While Abdullah and the other working </p><p>level officials agreed in principle, they referred the final </p><p>decision to the Minister of Defense.  General Abdullah said </p><p>that pending legislation would outlaw the trade in heavy </p><p>weapons and institute controls on the trade of light </p><p>weaponry, like Kalashnikovs.  He said ROYG will push hard to </p><p>get this legislation adopted, but in the interim ROYG is </p><p>actively engaged in working within tribal laws to collect as </p><p>many weapons as possible.  Referring to U.S. cooperation with </p><p>the U.S. Coast Guard and the Yemeni Special Forces, Abdullah </p><p>noted that the Yemen military appreciates this ongoing </p><p>cooperation and wants to expand it to include the weapons </p><p>buyback program. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  Ossama Al-Shami of Presidential Protocol called </p><p>Post on the afternoon of July 2 to request a meeting between </p><p>Brigadier General Shater and the Ambassador.  The meeting has </p><p>been scheduled for July 6th. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  Begin comment: ROYG had multiple TV cameras and </p><p>photographers covering the Ambassador\'s 7/2 walk-through of </p><p>the YSOF facility, and the efforts of his team to collect </p><p>data on the items recovered.  ROYG will use this event to </p><p>showcase their ongoing arm control efforts, and to ensure </p><p>their neighbors, especially Saudi Arabia, and the </p><p>international community that Yemen is committed to combating </p><p>weapons smuggling and terror.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
