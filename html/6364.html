The Government of Nepal (GON) and the Maoists jointly </p><p>announced the signing of a code of conduct on March 13. </p><p>Dinanath Sharma, senior-level Maoist and member of the </p><p>Maoist negotiating team, arrived in the capital and met with </p><p>the major leftist political parties.  Prime Minister </p><p>Lokendra Bahadur Chand called for the political parties to </p><p>put aside their differences and personal interests in order </p><p>to create lasting peace.  Narayan Singh Pun, Minister of </p><p>Physical Planning and Works and government-appointed peace </p><p>talks coordinator said that now was not the time to debate </p><p>the constitutionality of the present government, but to </p><p>solve the nation\'s problems.  The major parties boycotted, </p><p>for the second time, an all-party meeting called by Prime </p><p>Minister Chand on March 11 to discuss ceasefire </p><p>negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary Continued.  Fourteen Maoists escaped from police </p><p>custody in far-western Kanchanpur District on March 8 after </p><p>beating up the guards.  Imprisoned Maoists in Bhadrapur </p><p>District have launched protests.  Two Maoists were released </p><p>from prison in Navalparasi District, and the Supreme Court </p><p>ordered the release of fifteen other prisoners from a </p><p>Kathmandu jail.  Maoists reportedly detonated a powerful </p><p>bomb in Achham District in March 8 and destroyed a </p><p>communications tower.  Four Maoists were killed on March 8 </p><p>in Jajarkot District when a bomb they were carrying </p><p>exploded.  Maoists reportedly have attempted to extort money </p><p>from a schoolteacher in Baglung District.  The families of </p><p>two school children killed by Maoists at a Baglung District </p><p>school on February 18 (Reftel) have accused the GON of </p><p>failing to properly investigate the deaths out of fear of </p><p>disrupting the peace process.  The All Nepal National </p><p>Independent Students Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) </p><p>padlocked government-run colleges throughout the Kathmandu </p><p>Valley on March 9. The pro-Maoist student wing said the </p><p>lockdown would continue indefinitely.  The Appellate Court </p><p>of Patan in Kathmandu reportedly issued arrest warrants on </p><p>March 12 for Maoist leaders Prachanda,  Baburam Bhattarai, </p><p>and Ram Bahadur Thapa in response to the criminal cases </p><p>filed against them by the GON.  On March 8 Minister Pun </p><p>reportedly said that the donor community had pledged almost </p><p>two thousand tons of food grain to feed the insurgents. A </p><p>junior minister denied Pun\'s statement the next day.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>CODE OF CONDUCT SIGNED; MAJOR PARTIES REACT </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  After almost daily promises by Narayan Singh Pun, </p><p>Minister of Physical Planning and Works and government- </p><p>appointed coordinator for peace talks that a code of conduct </p><p>would be made public, the GON and the Maoists held a press </p><p>conference on March 13 and jointly announced that a twenty- </p><p>two-point code of conduct had been concluded between the GON </p><p>and the Maoists (septel). The code of conduct was signed by </p><p>Minister Pun and Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, leader of the Maoist </p><p>negotiation team.  Krishna Bahadur Mahara represented the </p><p>Maoist party at the press conference because Bhattarai is </p><p>still underground.  Mahara said the Maoists were committed </p><p>to a peaceful resolution, and the Maoist negotiating team, </p><p>including Bhattarai, would arrive in Kathmandu when they are </p><p>certain the code is being implemented properly. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The major political parties hailed the signing and </p><p>reportedly were hopeful that it signified the end of the </p><p>cycle of violence, murder and destruction, but also remained </p><p>somewhat skeptical about whether or not it would be followed </p><p>by both sides.  Arjun Narsingh K.C., spokesman of Nepali </p><p>Congress (NC), was quoted as saying the code of conduct was </p><p>positive, but was hesitant to judge how helpful it would be </p><p>until it was determined that the code was being implemented </p><p>properly. </p><p>5.  R.K. Mainali, member of the Communist Party of Nepal- </p><p>United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), said that the code should </p><p>be implemented honestly in order for lasting peace to be </p><p>achieved.  Kamal Thapa, Central Member of the Rastriya </p><p>Prajatantra Party (RPP), hailed the GON\'s "big achievement" </p><p>in releasing details of the code of conduct.   Deep Kumar </p><p>Upadhyay, Central Member of Nepali Congress (Democratic), </p><p>pledged his party\'s full cooperation in transforming the </p><p>ceasefire into a lasting peace. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST LEADER MEETS WITH LEFTIST PARTIES IN KATHMANDU </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Dinanath Sharma, senior-level Maoist and member of the </p><p>Maoist negotiating team, arrived in Kathmandu and met with </p><p>the major leftist political parties on March 11.  Sharma\'s </p><p>highly publicized arrival was the first public visit of a </p><p>senior Maoist since the announcement of the ceasefire. </p><p>Sharma declared the Maoists would join all the leftist </p><p>parties in a "united move against the King\'s regressive </p><p>step."  (Note:  The parties are protesting the King\'s </p><p>decision to dissolve the previous government on October 4, </p><p>2002).  Sharma also told reporters that he considers the </p><p>government under Prime Minister Chand illegitimate, and </p><p>reiterated that the Maoists are in negotiations with the </p><p>state (i.e., King Gyanendra) and not the Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Prior to the signing of the code of conduct, Sharma </p><p>reportedly accused the GON of delaying the peace process and </p><p>said the GON was "not serious and sincere for talks." </p><p>Sharma said the Maoists had expected to start talks by the </p><p>end of February, but the GON had not created a conducive </p><p>environment.  Minister Pun downplayed criticism of the GON, </p><p>declaring on March 9 that lasting peace would not be </p><p>attained simply by rushing the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>PRIME MINISTER URGES PARTY COOPERATION </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  On March 10 Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand called </p><p>for the political parties to put aside their differences and </p><p>personal interests in order to create lasting peace.  The </p><p>Prime Minister urged party leaders to "forget the bitter </p><p>past and unite for permanent peace."  The major parties </p><p>boycotted, for the second time, an all-party meeting called </p><p>by Prime Minister Chand on March 11. </p><p>They had boycotted a previous all-party meeting to which </p><p>they were invited by Chand on February 17. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Minister Pun echoed the Prime Minister\'s remarks on </p><p>March 10, saying that now was not the time to debate the </p><p>constitutionality of the present government, but to solve </p><p>the nation\'s problems.  Pun said that the GON had made </p><p>sincere efforts to include the major political parties in </p><p>the peace process, and reiterated that people should "rest </p><p>assure about the success of the talks." </p><p> </p><p>SKEPTICISM PERSISTS ABOUT PEACE TALKS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Local political analysts reportedly are wary of the </p><p>future of the peace talks because of the discontent among </p><p>the major political parties and the GON\'s dependence on </p><p>military action to solve the current crisis.  According to </p><p>press accounts, analysts who gathered on March 12 to discuss </p><p>the current political situation, contended the GON still </p><p>believes that it can solve the current crisis through </p><p>military action, as evidenced by its refusal to order the </p><p>army back to the barracks.  They are also concerned that </p><p>lasting peace cannot be achieved without the support of the </p><p>political parties. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Local human rights activists sympathetic to the Maoists </p><p>gathered on March 12 to urge both the GON and the Maoists to </p><p>come up with clear agendas and make adequate preparations </p><p>for the peace talks.  The activists reportedly accused the </p><p>GON of not taking matters seriously, not learning enough </p><p>about Maoist ideology, and being ill prepared.  They warned </p><p>that these were part of the reason why talks had failed </p><p>previously. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, President of Nepali Congress </p><p>(Democratic), said on March 7 that the Maoists should fully </p><p>commit to stop all violence and extortion, declaring that it </p><p>would be "suicidal" if the Maoists turn their back on the </p><p>talks again.  Deuba also reiterated his party\'s opposition </p><p>to the King\'s dissolution of the previous government on </p><p>October 4, demanding that the King reinstate the elected </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST JAILBREAK </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  Fourteen Maoists escaped from police custody in far- </p><p>western Kanchanpur District on March 8 after beating up the </p><p>guards.  Among the escapees are platoon leaders and section </p><p>commanders of the so-called Maoist Peoples Army.  The </p><p>insurgents had been arrested on weapons charges.  The </p><p>suspects are still at large and an investigation into the </p><p>jailbreak is underway. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The Supreme Court ordered the release on March 13 of </p><p>fifteen Maoists from a Kathmandu jail.  The detainees had </p><p>been in custody on suspicion of being involved in terrorist </p><p>activities.  The District Administration Office in </p><p>Navalparasi released two suspected Maoists from jail on </p><p>March 12, and said that nine other prisoners might also be </p><p>released after the necessary paperwork is completed. </p><p>Prisoners in Bhadrapur District have launched protests </p><p>demanding their release from custody.  The detainees have </p><p>staged different protests for the past two weeks, and have </p><p>planned another for March 23.  There are currently two </p><p>hundred and seventy-four inmates at the district jail. </p><p> </p><p>CONTINUED VIOLENCE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  Maoists reportedly set off a powerful bomb in Achham </p><p>District on March 8 and destroyed a communications tower. </p><p>Telecommunications had only been restored recently after a </p><p>previous attack on the tower by the insurgents caused major </p><p>damage.  However, sources in the district say that the tower </p><p>is now beyond repair.  Four Maoists were killed on March 8 </p><p>in Jajarkot District when a bomb they were carrying </p><p>exploded. </p><p> </p><p>16.  In Baglung District insurgents allegedly approached a </p><p>teacher on March 12 and threatened him with physical harm if </p><p>he did not give them almost a thousand dollars. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Senior level Maoists in Dang District announced on </p><p>March 8 that they would return over half a million dollars </p><p>in gold that the insurgents looted from the Nepal Bank </p><p>Limited in the district headquarters.  The insurgents said </p><p>the gold would be returned if the villagers could produce </p><p>genuine bank documents proving ownership. </p><p> </p><p>GON ACCUSED OF COVERUP IN DEATH OF CHILDREN </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  The families of two school children killed by Maoists </p><p>at a Baglung District school on February 18 (Reftel) have </p><p>accused the GON of failing to investigate properly the </p><p>deaths out of fear of disrupting the peace process. </p><p>District representatives from the Communist Party of Nepal- </p><p>United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), Nepali Congress (NC), </p><p>Nepali Congress (Democratic), and the Peoples Front Party </p><p>(PFP) also issued a press release accusing the GON of bowing </p><p>to Maoist threats not to investigate the killings.  The </p><p>parties reportedly said the killings were well planned and </p><p>said the Maoists and the GON are "trying to hide the facts." </p><p>The press release also says there have been other similar </p><p>incidents despite the ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>COURT ISSUES ARREST WARRANTS FOR MAOIST LEADERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>19.  According to press accounts, the Appellate Court of </p><p>Patan in Kathmandu Valley issued arrest warrants on March 12 </p><p>for Maoist leaders Prachanda, Baburam Bhattarai, and Ram </p><p>Bahadur Thapa in response to cases filed against them by the </p><p>GON.  The warrants declare that the Maoists have to appear </p><p>before the court within seventy days.  There has been no </p><p>response from the insurgents. </p><p> </p><p>ANNISU-R PADLOCKS COLLEGES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  The All Nepal National Independent Students Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) padlocked branches of government- </p><p>run Tribhuvan University throughout the Kathmandu Valley on </p><p>March 9.  Over half a dozen colleges were locked up by the </p><p>militant student wing of the Maoist party.  Dipendra Pant, </p><p>Chairman of the Kathmandu District of ANNISU-R, said the </p><p>lockdown would continue indefinitely unless the GON met </p><p>their five-point demands.  The demands include the release </p><p>of all imprisoned students; the release of information on </p><p>the whereabouts of Purna Poudel, General Secretary of ANNISU- </p><p>R; an immediate end to arrests of pro-Maoist students; a ban </p><p>on security forces inside campuses; and the admission of pro- </p><p>Maoist students to government-run universities. </p><p> </p><p>21.  The ANNISU-R issued an additional seventy-two hour </p><p>ultimatum on March 13 threatening further lockdowns if the </p><p>whereabouts of their comrades were not made public.  The </p><p>militants also demanded that all detained and missing </p><p>students be released by March 19. </p><p> </p><p>22.  The Ministry of Education reportedly has contacted the </p><p>ANNISU-R for talks, and Minister Pun sent a letter on March </p><p>10 to the ANNISU-R inviting them to the negotiating table </p><p>and declaring that the GON was ready to solve the problem as </p><p>soon as possible.  (Note:  The ANNISU-R withdrew a call for </p><p>a nationwide strike of educational institutions last month </p><p>after the announcement of the ceasefire).  As of March 14 </p><p>the campuses remain locked. </p><p> </p><p>GON TO PROVIDE FOOD TO MAOISTS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>23.  There are conflicting reports over whether or not the </p><p>GON has promised food to the Maoists.  On March 8 Narayan </p><p>Singh Pun, Minister of Physical Planning and Works, </p><p>reportedly announced that the donor community had pledged </p><p>almost two thousand tons of food grain to feed Maoist cadre. </p><p>Minsiter Pun was quoted as saying that the insurgents often </p><p>resort to looting because they do not have sufficient </p><p>clothing and food, and therefore, the GON was offering the </p><p>food to stop the need for looting.  However, on March 9, </p><p>just one day after Pun\'s statement, Rabindra Khanal, </p><p>Assistant Minister of Education and Sports, denied that the </p><p>GON was offering food to the Maoists.  Khanal issued a </p><p>strong statement saying the GON had not reached any decision </p><p>to provide food. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
