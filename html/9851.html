ON 07/31, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>PUBLISHED THE FOLLOWING ON "HI" MAGAZINE: </p><p> </p><p>"IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT WANTS TO </p><p>CONTROL THE MINDS OF ARAB YOUTHS. THE LAUNCH OF \'RADIO </p><p>SAWA,\' WHICH PLAYS BOTH ARABIC AND ENGLISH SONGS, AIMS </p><p>AT SENDING A MESSAGE THAT PROMISES A NEW WORLD ORDER AND </p><p>OPPOSES ALL THOUGHTS AND IDEAS AGAINST THE AMERICAN WAY </p><p>OF LIFE." </p><p> </p><p>"THE UNITED STATES WASN\'T SATISFIED WITH \'SAWA\' AND SO </p><p>IT IS PUBLISHING A MAGAZINE IN ARABIC, \'HI,\' WHICH </p><p>TARGETS THE YOUTH IN THE MIDDLE EAST. \'HI,\' WHICH IS A </p><p>GREETING WORD IN ENGLISH, WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE </p><p>MARKET THIS MONTH.  THE NAMES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH </p><p>\'HI\' WILL BE CIRCULATED APPEAR ON THE FRONT PAGE, AND </p><p>THE ORDER OF THESE COUNTRIES SHOWS THE PRIORITIES OF </p><p>THOSE WHO THE MAGAZINE TARGETS.  THE LIST STARTS WITH </p><p>EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA AND ENDS WITH ALGERIA, THE WEST </p><p>BANK, AND THE GAZA STRIP ALONG WITH ISRAEL." </p><p> </p><p>"THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING THROUGH THIS MEDIA PROJECT </p><p>TO CHANGE THE CURRENT NEGATIVE IMAGE OF THE U.S. AMONG </p><p>ARABS, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE WAR IN IRAQ.  THE MONTHLY </p><p>MAGAZINE WILL COVER AND PROMOTE ISSUES ABOUT AMERICAN </p><p>CULTURE AND COUNTER NEGATIVE PROPAGANDA AND ANTI- </p><p>AMERICAN FEELINGS IN THE MIDDLE EAST." </p><p> </p><p>"IN THE FIRST ISSUE OF \'HI,\' AN ARTICLE APPEARED ABOUT A </p><p>COVERED MUSLIM GIRL WHO ADMITTED THAT WHEN SHE FIRST </p><p>ARRIVED TO THE U.S., SHE HAD A NEGATIVE IMAGE ABOUT </p><p>AMERICAN PEOPLE AND LIFE.  LATER, SHE DISCOVERED THAT </p><p>AMERICAN MOVIES CONCENTRATED MORE ON ACTION RATHER THAN </p><p>REALITY.
