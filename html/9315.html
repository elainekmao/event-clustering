<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004247 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN SEEKS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF IRAQI OIL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B)&(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) During a 9 July meeting, Jordanian FM Marwan Muasher </p><p>raised with Ambassador the status of a proposed trip to </p><p>Baghdad by a Jordanian interministerial team.  The purpose of </p><p>the visit would be to follow-up at a technical level on a </p><p>conversation Industry & Trade Minister Salah al-Bashir had </p><p>with CPA Advisor Reuben Jeffery during the Dead Sea World </p><p>Economic Forum meeting, and to discuss arrangements for the </p><p>commercial supply of Iraqi crude oil to Jordan.  The Foreign </p><p>Ministry will be providing a proposed delegation list to post </p><p>shortly.  Trade Minister al-Bashir, following up on his </p><p>commitment to Jeffery, has also provided a "non-paper" </p><p>listing the other issues the delegation wishes to discuss. </p><p>Post will provide this to CPA and NEA. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador informed Muasher that the embassy had not </p><p>yet received a reply from CPA to the request for meetings in </p><p>Baghdad, but was continuing to work the issue.  Muasher </p><p>stressed that the delegation wished to travel to Iraq as soon </p><p>as possible and lock in an oil supply deal before Jordan </p><p>faced an oil shortage, possibly by the end of July.  Muasher </p><p>explained that Saudi Arabia continued to supply Jordan with </p><p>the 50,000 bbl/day it had pledged, but nevertheless the GOJ </p><p>was compelled to draw down its stocks by roughly 40,000 </p><p>barrels a day to meet domestic consumption requirements. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) While Kuwait had provided oil, the Kuwaiti oil was </p><p>incompatible with Jordan\'s refinery and had to be sold to </p><p>finance the purchase of compatible crude.  This had upset </p><p>some Kuwaiti officials, who stopped crude deliveries to </p><p>Jordan.  Muasher called the Kuwaiti Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Mohammad, who promised to resolve the </p><p>problem.  Muasher added that the United Arab Emirates had </p><p>delivered only two of its promised payments, further </p><p>exacerbating the situation. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador mentioned that U.S. supplemental assistance </p><p>was intended to solve just such problems and permit Jordan to </p><p>purchase the crude it needed on the open market.  Muasher </p><p>agreed, but said that Iraq represented the least expensive </p><p>source of oil for Jordan, even at market prices (which the </p><p>GOJ is ready and willing to pay), and that it was only </p><p>logical for the GOJ to actively pursue the cheapest available </p><p>option.  Hence, the Jordanians wanted to reach an agreement </p><p>quickly with the CPA to re-establish Iraq as a supplier of </p><p>crude to Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador cautioned Muasher to be pragmatic in </p><p>considering the early resumption of Iraqi crude deliveries. </p><p>The lack of security in Iraq and the ongoing problems in </p><p>raising production levels were real uncertainties and </p><p>concerns.  As Jeffery had told the Jordanians at the WEF </p><p>Summit, crude production first would be used to meet domestic </p><p>Iraqi needs -- then come exports.  Muasher said he </p><p>understood, but reiterated that the GOJ hoped to confirm its </p><p>requested meetings with the CPA as soon as possible and to </p><p>negotiate a supply agreement before Iraqi oil production was </p><p>committed elsewhere. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
