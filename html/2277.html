". . .IT IS STRANGE THAT THERE SHOULD BE </p><p>   ZIMBABWEANS CELEBRATING AMERICA\'S PASSING OF A SO- </p><p>   CALLED DEMOCRACY BILL THAT IN FACT SEEKS TO CURTAIL </p><p>   DEMOCRACY.  IT IS AN OPEN SECRET THAT THE WORLD\'S </p><p>   FORMER COLONIAL POWERS ALREADY HAVE A CANDIDATE IN MIND </p><p>   AND THEY ARE ONLY WAITING FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF </p><p>   RESULTS AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PLEBISCITE.  WE ARE TOLD </p><p>   THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE SO-CALLED ZDERA IS TO PRESSURE </p><p>   PRESIDENT MUGABE INTO HOLDING FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS </p><p>   AND ESTABLISH LAND OWNERSHIP PROTECTION.  THERE IS AN </p><p>   INSINUATION HERE THAT IT IS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION THAT </p><p>   THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WILL NOT BE FREE AND FAIR. </p><p>   WE SYMPATHIZE WITH THE IGNORANCE AND NAIVETY (SIC) OF </p><p>   THE AMERICANS.  IF THEY EVER BOTHERED TO READ </p><p>   ZIMBABWE\'S HISTORY, THEY WOULD KNOW THAT THIS COUNTRY </p><p>   HAS HELD SEVERAL ELECTIONS THAT WERE FREE AND FAIR. </p><p>   ANYWAY, WHO ARE THE AMERICANS TO TEACH US ABOUT </p><p>   CONDUCTING FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS WHEN THEY THEMSELVES </p><p>   FAILED DISMALLY TO CONDUCT PROPER PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>   ELECTIONS EARLY THIS YEAR.  FOR ALL WE KNOW THE </p><p>   INCUMBENT PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH IS IN POWER </p><p>   FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION OF THE COURTS IN THAT </p><p>   COUNTRY.  IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL DEMOCRACY?  FAILURES </p><p>   LIKE THE AMERICANS DO NOT QUALIFY TO LECTURE ZIMBABWE </p><p>   ON DEMOCRACY. . .  THE AMERICAN EVIL BILL IS AN ATTEMPT </p><p>   TO RUN ZIMBABWE BY REMOTE CONTROL, AND WE SAY NO TO </p><p>   THIS.
