(U) In response to refs a & b, Post identifies the </p><p>following outstanding bilateral trade and non-trade issues </p><p>that could negatively impact perception of a U.S.-Central </p><p>American free trade agreement in the U.S. private sector and </p><p>Congress. </p><p> </p><p>Agriculture Import Restrictions </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Honduras has had a ban on U.S. raw poultry imports </p><p>for some time.  USDA FAS estimates that if Honduran </p><p>restrictions on U.S. raw poultry and poultry parts were </p><p>lifted, U.S. producers could export an additional USD 10 </p><p>million of poultry products to Honduras, annually. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Since President Maduro took office on January 27, </p><p>Embassy has received a series of complaints from local </p><p>importers regarding import restrictions, difficult </p><p>certification requirements and other obstacles to the </p><p>importation of U.S. pork, poultry and dairy products.  GOH </p><p>agriculture officials, in increasing the bureaucratic </p><p>requirements to import U.S. products, appear bent on using </p><p>sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures as a way to </p><p>restrict imports and support local poultry and pork </p><p>producers.  GOH officials, in turn, claim that Honduran </p><p>importers provide partial documentation, either for purposes </p><p>of tax evasion or in order to evade SPS restrictions on </p><p>products from third countries.  U.S. companies Cargill and </p><p>PriceSmart (a subsidiary of Costco) have been among the </p><p>companies complaining in 2002 of import obstacles.  Post </p><p>notes that in 2001, Honduras imported USD 6.1 million of </p><p>U.S. dairy products, USD 6 million of U.S. pork products, </p><p>USD 3.5 million of U.S. poultry products. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) In February, several Honduran importers of U.S. meat </p><p>and dairy products complained to the Embassy that Honduras\' </p><p>Office of Plant and Animal Health (SENASA) was denying </p><p>applications for the importation of goods from the United </p><p>States on the basis that the plants producing the food </p><p>products had not been certified by SENASA (ref c).  SENASA </p><p>Director Reyes explained that the actions were being taken </p><p>not on the basis of Honduran phytosanitary law but due to a </p><p>Honduran implementing regulation adopted in late 2001 and </p><p>that the GOH believes its actions are consistent with its </p><p>WTO commitments.  He committed to ensuring the clearance of </p><p>all U.S. agriculture imports as soon as the importers fill </p><p>out applications for pre-certification.  While the </p><p>complaints have lessened since that time, there have been </p><p>some sporadic incidents over this requirement. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) In June, SENASA began restricting imports of U.S. </p><p>poultry products over concerns of an outbreak of avian </p><p>influenza in the U.S.  After some negotiation, GOH officials </p><p>agreed to allow poultry imports if and when USDA certifies </p><p>that the products originate from a zone free of avian </p><p>influenza (ref d).  The ensuing back and forth on whether </p><p>USDA can certify poultry products free of low pathogen avian </p><p>influenza delayed entry of cooked and mechanically deboned </p><p>poultry meat into the Honduran market.  USDA FAS is aware of </p><p>several U.S. suppliers that have turned away from selling to </p><p>Honduras because of these reported difficulties. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) There doesn\'t seem to be any legitimate health </p><p>concern over U.S. pork imports, which SENASA began </p><p>restricting in June and July (ref e).  The GOH indicated </p><p>privately to importers that it is interested in limiting the </p><p>number of containers from certain companies (ostensibly over </p><p>concerns that importers don\'t have the necessary cold </p><p>storage capacity to handle the amount of imports).  After </p><p>discussions with Embassy and importers about paperwork </p><p>requirements, GOH obstacles to pork product imports from the </p><p>U.S. began to ebb. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) In October, in response to an announcement by USDA </p><p>of a recall of turkey products originating from certain </p><p>plants in the U.S. due to listeria, SENASA announced that it </p><p>would restrict imports of U.S. turkey, chicken and other </p><p>products susceptible to listeria.  Without consultation or </p><p>prior notice, SENASA told importers it requires FSIS or </p><p>APHIS to certify that these products are free of listeria </p><p>and newcastle disease.  Embassy has begun discussions with </p><p>SENASA officials over USDA\'s zero tolerance policy for </p><p>listeria in cooked and processed food, and appropriate </p><p>action on raw turkey.  We expect this issue to be </p><p>problematic in the near term. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Post is also concerned that the GOH is not giving </p><p>advance notice of changes in import regulations as required </p><p>by WTO rules.  We are skeptical that SENASA is applying </p><p>equivalent SPS treatment to domestic poultry and pork </p><p>products. </p><p> </p><p>IPR Issues </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer has complained </p><p>that the Ministry of Health, in approving a competing </p><p>company\'s pharmaceutical product, did not respect Pfizer\'s </p><p>data exclusivity rights as guaranteed in article 77 of </p><p>Honduras\' Industrial Property Law and article 39 of the WTO </p><p>TRIP\'s agreement.  The Ministry of Health approved the </p><p>pharmaceutical product, despite communication from Honduras\' </p><p>IPR Division that Pfizer\'s research and data were protected </p><p>under Honduran law.  Pfizer argues that in order for the </p><p>competing product to be legally registered with the Ministry </p><p>of Health, the company needs to provide the research and </p><p>data to support their application.  Honduran law provides </p><p>five-year exclusive use of data provided in support of </p><p>registering pharmaceutical products. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) U.S. companies, through the Business Software </p><p>Alliance (BSA), complain that attempts to prosecute computer </p><p>software infringement cases have been met with resistance by </p><p>officials in the Ministry of Industry and Trade\'s IPR </p><p>Division and the GOH\'s Attorney General\'s Office who often </p><p>cite procedural problems or lack of resources as the main </p><p>causes of government inaction. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Honduras largely complied with the Trade Related </p><p>Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement by </p><p>the January 1, 2000 deadline.  However, there has been no </p><p>action by the GOH to obtain approval of two laws governing </p><p>the designs of integrated circuits and plant variety </p><p>protection in the National Congress.  Approval of the two </p><p>laws is necessary for Honduras to be in complete TRIPS </p><p>compliance. </p><p> </p><p>AES </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) U.S. energy company AES is the only U.S. finalist </p><p>in the current bidding for a 210 MW tender by the GOH (refs </p><p>f, g & h).  AES has plans to build a usd 650 million liquid </p><p>natural gas-fired power plant with transmission lines and </p><p>LNG port that would serve Honduras, El Salvador and other </p><p>countries in the region.  General Electric is a strategic </p><p>partner in this project.  The state-run electricity company </p><p>(ENEE) has delayed announcement of the winner, presumably </p><p>because of heavy pressure by Honduran competitors in the </p><p>thermal and hydropower sector.  While the Maduro </p><p>administration has assured that the 210 MW tender will be </p><p>fair and transparent, the government-controlled process </p><p>provides ample opportunity for discretion and manipulation. </p><p>One possible issue is that one domestic firm, which bid low, </p><p>did not include the price of constructing a new substation </p><p>and accompanying power lines in its bid offer.  Presumably </p><p>this company should be disqualified. </p><p> </p><p>Property, Investment and Commercial Disputes </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) The Embassy has files on over 150 property and </p><p>investment cases involving U.S. citizens.  The 2002 Helms </p><p>Act report (ref I) includes 9 cases that could be termed </p><p>expropriation without adequate compensation, under the </p><p>definition used in the Helms Act.  Eight of the claims </p><p>described in the Helms Act report involve the Honduran </p><p>National Agrarian Institute (INA) and land invasion by </p><p>squatters.  Land invasions are common for both Honduran and </p><p>foreign landowners.  According to the National Agrarian </p><p>Reform Law, idle land fit for farming can be expropriated </p><p>and awarded to the landless poor.  Generally, an INA </p><p>expropriation case begins after squatters target and invade </p><p>unprotected property. The squatters then file for the land </p><p>with the INA under the Agrarian Reform Law.  In most cases, </p><p>pursuit of the subsequent legal avenues has proven to be </p><p>costly and time consuming, and has rarely lead to positive </p><p>results.  Representatives in the U.S. Congress have been </p><p>contacted about land cases in Honduras, especially Senator </p><p>Graham of Florida who has been contacted by four </p><p>constituents about their cases. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Post demarched the Honduran government repeatedly </p><p>in 2001 and 2002 on the importance of establishing a </p><p>mechanism that will allow progress on expropriation cases </p><p>involving U.S. citizens (ref j).  In late August, the GOH </p><p>informed us that they are pursuing our recommendation of </p><p>letting land cases involving the Honduran or municipal </p><p>government be resolved in arbitration rather than through </p><p>the courts (this will require legislation, which has not yet </p><p>been submitted to Congress).  Note: Honduras\' first </p><p>experience with arbitration involving a private dispute </p><p>between U.S. and Honduran companies does not bode well; the </p><p>U.S. company is now appealing the arbitral award to its </p><p>former subcontractor, alleging corruption.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) The Embassy is aware of numerous other property </p><p>and investment disputes involving U.S. investors, the </p><p>majority of which have arisen out of inadequate titling </p><p>procedures or fraudulent business dealings and involve </p><p>disputes between U.S. and Honduran citizens.  In many of the </p><p>private disputes between U.S. and Honduran citizens, the </p><p>U.S. citizens charge unfair, often egregious, treatment in </p><p>the court system.  Most of these problems arose under </p><p>previous administrations.  In the case of the Moore family </p><p>in Roatan, however, an unwarranted eviction from their </p><p>property occurred in August (ref k).  While the case has </p><p>received widespread attention, there has not yet been a </p><p>favorable result. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) U.S. Tobacco and textile company JE Morgan have </p><p>both had difficult and prolonged labor cases that arose when </p><p>the companies tried to investigate or dismiss key employees. </p><p>(Note: In the case of U.S. Tobacco, the dismissed employee </p><p>is a U.S. citizen and the Embassy is therefore limited in </p><p>its role.  End note.)  In both cases, the employees have </p><p>gone to the labor courts requesting extremely high severance </p><p>packages.  Texaco has complained of undue delays and lack of </p><p>due process in its contractual dispute with a franchisee. </p><p>Transpacific Geothermal has complained that slow, </p><p>inefficient court proceedings have unjustifiably tied up the </p><p>company\'s bid to build a small geothermal energy project in </p><p>Western Honduras.  (Note: Another U.S. citizen is suing the </p><p>GOH over a former mining concession on the land.  End note.) </p><p>U.S. companies have also complained about judicial </p><p>procedures that inhibit the return of stolen property. </p><p>Several U.S. companies and investors have complained of </p><p>arbitrary and unfair environmental permitting procedures, </p><p>although this appears to have improved significantly under </p><p>the Maduro administration.  The U.S. companies have alleged </p><p>unfair treatment in the courts and indicated that the state </p><p>of the judicial system has dissuaded them from any new </p><p>investments. </p><p> </p><p>Labor </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>17.  Although not mentioned in other Central American posts\' </p><p>cables on bilateral trade and non-trade issues affecting </p><p>U.S.-CAFTA, civil society in Central America and the U.S. </p><p>have voiced concern over labor issues throughout the region </p><p>and are likely to press for improvement in the labor </p><p>situation and swifter action to eradicate the worst forms of </p><p>child labor as conditions for a trade agreement.  Concerns </p><p>frequently mentioned by international labor organizations </p><p>and NGOs, especially in the maquila sector, include </p><p>challenges to and problems with the freedom of association, </p><p>the right to organize, the right to strike and the right to </p><p>collectively bargain.  These rights are generally respected </p><p>in practice, but enforcement is weak.  While many Central </p><p>American countries, including Honduras, are party to ILO </p><p>Convention 182 to eradicate the worst forms of child labor, </p><p>the private sector - particularly in coffee, melon, </p><p>sugarcane, and lobster agroindustrial production for export </p><p>- continues to employ children in hazardous agricultural </p><p>activities in which the minors also lose opportunities for </p><p>schooling (see ref L).  Other illicit activities in which </p><p>minors engage in throughout Central America and which are </p><p>even more difficult to enforce include commercial sex </p><p>exploitation in tourist and border areas and illegal </p><p>narcotics smuggling in the border areas and the Caribbean </p><p>coast.  (Note:  There are numerous regional projects </p><p>supported by USDOL with the goal of working to eradicate the </p><p>worst forms of child labor.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Other Issues </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) The GOH provides extensive tax incentives to </p><p>foreign and domestic companies, especially in the apparel </p><p>assembly sector and widely defined tourism.  Companies </p><p>operating in designated export processing zones are exempt </p><p>from paying import duties on goods and capital equipment and </p><p>from state and municipal taxes.  In the lead up to the </p><p>initiation of the Doha round, the GOH put priority on </p><p>maintenance of its incentives regime.  The GOH will continue </p><p>to provide incentives through 2010 per WTO rules allowing </p><p>countries with GDP per capita under USD 1,000 to maintain </p><p>free trade zones.  Previously negotiated contracts with </p><p>franchisees provide tax incentives to some Honduran owners </p><p>of fast food outlets for another 15 years.  Electric power </p><p>producers are allowed to import fuel duty free, but some </p><p>national firms may be taking advantage of the tax exemption </p><p>to evade taxes on the sale of refined oil products.  Embassy </p><p>understands that investment incentives are an issue in the </p><p>Canada-Central America free trade talks.  International </p><p>donors, including the IMF, IDB and World Bank, have </p><p>identified the GOH\'s extensive tax exemptions as a main </p><p>contributor to the Government\'s perennial fiscal problems. </p><p>During U.S-CAFTA talks, U.S. negotiators should be aware of </p><p>the interplay of the trade and fiscal issues. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU) The IMF and the World Bank are looking closely at </p><p>the fragile financial sector in Honduras.  The Honduran </p><p>banking system is considered weak and in need of </p><p>consolidation.  Insider abuses and heavy losses in key </p><p>sectors have combined to contribute to a large overhang of </p><p>bad loans.  Problems in the financial sector affect interest </p><p>rates and the availability of medium and long-term lending. </p><p>During the U.S.-CAFTA trade talks on financial services, </p><p>U.S. negotiators should be aware of the measures the IMF and </p><p>World Bank are recommending to strengthen the banking </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (U) We also note that Honduras has failed to implement </p><p>fully its customs valuation obligations.  The U.S.-CAFTA </p><p>negotiations could be used to push for more complete </p><p>implementation of the WTO customs valuation agreement. </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
