<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001062 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HOMELAND SECURITY FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KPLS, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS02, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE SILENT MAJORITY:  CANADIAN OPINION OF THE U.S. </p><p>AND THE WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  a) Ottawa 723; b) Ottawa 917 (C); c) Ottawa 1014; d) </p><p> </p><p>Quebec 51 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary. Ambassador Cellucci\'s public expression, March </p><p>25, of U.S. "disappointment" over the Canadian government\'s </p><p>posture on the war in Iraq has led to an outpouring of </p><p>response from the general public.  Since the speech, public </p><p>opinion polls have consistently shown growing public </p><p>approval of U.S. action in Iraq.  Other anecdotal evidence, </p><p>including public demonstrations and write-in campaigns to </p><p>the Embassy, suggest far greater support from Canadians for </p><p>the U.S. than could be inferred from Canadian media reports </p><p>and government statements.  These indicators, however, show </p><p>a divide between Anglophone Canada and Quebec, where a </p><p>majority continue to oppose the war (reftel d), in part </p><p>because much of their news comes from France.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION POLLING - GROWING SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. IN </p><p>ANGLOPHONE CANADA. </p><p> </p><p>2. The latest Ipsos-Reid poll, conducted April 1-3, shows a </p><p>majority of Canadians outside Quebec (54 per cent) support </p><p>U.S. led military action.  Not surprisingly, Albertans are </p><p>the Canadians most likely to express support for the U.S. </p><p>(62 per cent); they are followed by residents of </p><p>Saskatchewan/Manitoba (55 per cent); Ontario (54 percent); </p><p>Atlantic Canada (53 per cent); and British Colombia (51 per </p><p>cent).  Nationally, Canadians are evenly split, with 48 </p><p>percent supporting and 48 per cent opposing the U.S. led war </p><p>in Iraq.  In Quebec, however, only 29 per cent express </p><p>support for the war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3. A separate poll, conducted April 4-6 by COMPAS for "The </p><p>National Post," confirms this trend in public opinion.  The </p><p>COMPAS poll finds that 72 per cent of Canadians "believe </p><p>Canada should have supported the U.S. at the start of the </p><p>war."  That figure breaks down into 41 per cent who believe </p><p>Canada should have given "verbal support" to the U.S. at the </p><p>beginning of the war; and another 31 percent who say that </p><p>Canadian support should have included a commitment of troops </p><p>as well as verbal support.  However, a much smaller </p><p>majority, 56 percent, agree with the original U.S. decision </p><p>to invade Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER INDICATORS OF SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. - PUBLIC </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. Since the invasion of Iraq, public demonstrations have </p><p>been common in many of Canada\'s major cities.  Ottawa has </p><p>witnessed regular anti-war and anti-U.S. demonstrations. </p><p>Typically, those demonstrations have convened on Parliament </p><p>Hill about noon on Saturday and circle the Embassy </p><p>throughout Saturday afternoon.  The demonstrations of March </p><p>29 were far different.  Despite a cold, steady rain, a group </p><p>of 4,000 to 5,000, the largest since the onset of combat </p><p>operations, rallied on Parliament Hill to demonstrate </p><p>support for the coalition, with U.S. and UK flags on </p><p>prominent display.  This contrasted with about 500 anti-war </p><p>demonstrators who appeared near the Embassy.  On the same </p><p>day there were also large "friends of the USA" </p><p>demonstrations in Calgary and other communities in Alberta </p><p>March 29.  A similar pro-U.S. rally drew about 4,000 in </p><p>Toronto April 5 during one of the worst ice storms of the </p><p>season. </p><p> </p><p>LETTERS FROM THE PUBLIC TO THE EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>5. Following Ambassador Cellucci\'s speech in Toronto, the </p><p>Embassy was deluged with calls, e-mails and letters from the </p><p>public.  Initially, the mailed letters were overwhelmingly </p><p>supportive of the U.S. position, while electronic messages </p><p>were largely critical.  In the past week, those </p><p>communications have been more nearly balanced.  To date, the </p><p>Embassy in Ottawa has received close to 600 letters </p><p>supporting the U.S. and about 450 that are critical.  The </p><p>Embassy in Ottawa has received about 150 e-mails that are </p><p>supportive and about 250 that are critical. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. The polling data and the public response indicates there </p><p>is more of a "silent majority" of Canadians outside Quebec, </p><p>that supports U.S. action in Iraq than would be supposed </p><p>from Canadian media coverage and commentary.  The polling </p><p>data and public response also reinforce our observation that </p><p>on this issue, Canadian media reporting and commentary are </p><p>significantly driven by official Canadian government </p><p>statements and by statements from the Liberal Party caucus. </p><p> </p><p>7. As for Quebec public opinion, a leading Quebec pollster </p><p>suggested that Quebeckers receive a significant portion of </p><p>their information from French sources.  TV5 is available on </p><p>the ubiquitous cable channels, and Agence France Presse is </p><p>frequently used by the Francophone media.  Given the sharply </p><p>negative French take on Iraq, this pollster thought this </p><p>accounted for at least part of the divergence with the rest </p><p>of Canada. </p><p> </p><p>8. One thoughtful media pundit suggested that there is a </p><p>large segment of the Canadian public who, whether or not </p><p>they support Canada\'s direct involvement in the war, are </p><p>deeply troubled that Canada is not supporting its two </p><p>traditional allies, the U.S. and the U.K.  How these </p><p>sentiments of the public may affect substantive Canadian </p><p>support for large-scale humanitarian assistance and </p><p>reconstruction efforts in Iraq remains to be seen.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
