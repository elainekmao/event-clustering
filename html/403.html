<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 JERUSALEM 03430 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: KPAL, KISL, PINS, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: FATAH AND HAMAS CLAIM RECONCILIATION </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: FOLLOWING TWO MONTHS OF CLASHES AND </p><p>ACCUSATORY LEAFLETS, HAMAS AND FATAH HAVE ISSUED A </p><p>COMMUNIQUE ANNOUNCING THEIR RECONCILIATION.  THE </p><p>LEAFLET, WHICH CLAIMS TO SPEAK ALSO FOR THE UNLU, CALLS </p><p>FOR CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DIFFERENCES, RESPECT </p><p>FOR MOSQUES AND IMAMS (PRESUMABLY A REFERENCE TO FATAH </p><p>SUPPORTERS HAVING EJECTED SEVERAL IMAMS WHO HAD </p><p>CRITICIZED SADDAM HUSSEIN), AND ALLEGES THAT STARTING </p><p>WITH THEIR MOST RECENT LEAFLETS, UNLU AND HAMAS ARE </p><p>COMMITTED TO "IMPLEMENTING THE SAME ACTIVITIES."  THE </p><p>LEAFLET APPEARS TO GIVE GREATER STATURE TO HAMAS AND A </p><p>DEGREE OF PARITY WITH FATAH (WHICH IT HAS NOT HAD </p><p>BEFORE), AND IT IS WIDELY VIEWED HERE AS REFLECTING </p><p>GAINS MADE BY ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS IN THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES FOLLOWING THE BREAKDOWN OF THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>AND THE ERUPTION OF THE GULF CRISIS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>FATAH-HAMAS DIFFERENCES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>3.  A JOINT FATAH-HAMAS LEAFLET WAS ISSUED SEPTEMBER 19 </p><p>IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES ANNOUNCING RECONCILIATION </p><p>BETWEEN FATAH AND HAMAS.  THE GROWING RIVALRY BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO GROUPS HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED OVER THE PAST TWO </p><p>MONTHS IN A SERIES OF CLASHES AND ACCUSATORY LEAFLETS: </p><p> </p><p>-- IN JULY, THERE WERE CLASHES BETWEEN PLO AND HAMAS </p><p>SUPPORTERS IN THE VILLAGE OF IDNA, NEAR NABLUS, AND IN </p><p>NABLUS ITSELF, WHILE PLO ACTIVISTS REPORTEDLY STABBED </p><p>TWO HAMAS-AFFILIATED VILLAGE MAYORS NEAR JENIN. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN AUGUST, IN RAMALLAH, HAMAS ISSUED LEAFLETS </p><p>ATTACKING FATAH.  IN ADDITION, LOCAL IMAMS IN BETHLEHEM </p><p>AND QALQILYA WERE REPORTEDLY EJECTED FROM THEIR MOSQUES </p><p>BY FATAH ACTIVISTS AFTER PREACHING AGAINST IRAQ\'S </p><p>INVASION OF KUWAIT. </p><p> </p><p>--  ON SEPTEMBER 9 AND 10, FOLLOWING AN EARLIER INCIDENT </p><p>IN THE VILLAGE OF BAL\'A WHEN FATAH PREVENTED THE LOCAL </p><p>IMAM FROM DELIVERING A SERMON, DOZENS OF MASKED FATAH </p><p>AND HAMAS ACTIVISTS FOUGHT EACH OTHER WITH AXES AND </p><p>SWORDS IN TULKAREM CAMP (WHICH, ACCORDING TO PALESTINIAN </p><p>SOURCES QUOTED IN THE PRESS, HAS A LARGER PROPORTION OF </p><p>HAMAS SUPPORTERS THAN ANY OTHER WEST BANK CAMP).  IN A </p><p>BIZARRE FOLLOW-UP, THE IDF RAIDED THE TULKAREM </p><p>MUNICIPALITY THE FOLLOWING DAY AND TEMPORARILY ARRESTED </p><p>SOME 15 MEMBERS OF A FATAH-HAMAS RECONCILIATION </p><p>COMMITTEE, WHICH INCLUDED THE TOWN\'S MAYOR, AND EAST </p><p>JERUSALEMITE FEISAL HUSSEINI. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN GAZA\'S JABALYA CAMP, HAMAS ATTACKED SEVERAL </p><p>ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE PALESTINIAN COMMUNIST PARTY, AND </p><p>ORGANIZED A MARCH IN WHICH THEY CHANTED SLOGANS AGAINST </p><p>THE COMMUNISTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- LONG, MUTUALLY ACCUSATORY LEAFLETS ISSUED BY BOTH </p><p>SIDES DURING THE ABOVE CLASHES HAVE CALLED FOR UNITY, </p><p>ALLEGING THAT THE OTHER SIDE WAS MANUFACTURING INTERNAL </p><p>CONFLICTS WHICH ONLY SERVED THE ENEMY.  FOR ITS PART, </p><p>UNLU ANNOUNCED THAT ANY ATTACK AGAINST A FACTION OF THE </p><p>PLO "OR A NATIONALIST INDIVIDUAL" IS AN ATTACK AGAINST </p><p>UNLU ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON SEPTEMBER 22, AFTER THE LEAFLET WAS ISSUED, A </p><p>PROMINENT HAMAS SUPPORTER, DR. NIHAD AL-MASRI, WAS </p><p>BEATEN IN HIS NABLUS CLINIC BY MASKED MEN.  NABLUS </p><p>OBSERVED A GENERAL STRIKE CALLED BY HAMAS THE NEXT DAY. </p><p> </p><p>RECONCILIATION? </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE UNNUMBERED SEPTEMBER 19 LEAFLET, ENTITLED </p><p>"COMMUNIQUE OF PUBLIC OPINION FROM HAMAS AND FATAH," </p><p>ALLUDES OBLIQUELY TO THESE INCIDENTS AND OUTLINES A </p><p>PROGRAM OF "RECONCILIATION" WHICH STRONGLY FAVORS HAMAS </p><p>POSITIONS AND PROGRAMS.  REFERRING TO "SOME RECENT </p><p>UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS," THE LEAFLET SAYS THAT </p><p>DIFFERENCES IN OPINION ARE NATURAL AND HEALTHY, AND THAT </p><p>"A CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND DISTRICT SUB-COMMITTEES" WILL </p><p>BE FORMED TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS.  ALL PENDING PROBLEMS </p><p>"SHOULD BE FORGOTTEN," AND A NEW PAGE OPENED.  MOSQUES, </p><p>AND THEIR IMAMS AND WORSHIPPERS, SHOULD BE RESPECTED. </p><p>MOREOVER, "EVERY FACTION HAS THE RIGHT TO CARRY OUT ITS </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN FULL, WITHOUT ANY OBJECTION FROM THE OTHER </p><p>PARTY." </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE LEAFLET FURTHER STATES THAT: </p><p> </p><p>--  HAMAS WILL BE EQUALLY REPRESENTED IN ALL PRISON </p><p>COMMITTEES; </p><p> </p><p>--  THE TWO GROUPS "ARE COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT THE SAME </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  EACH PARTY WILL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>OTHER\'S ACTIVITIES AS IF THEY WERE ITS OWN." </p><p> </p><p>-- PERSONS EXPELLED FROM THEIR VILLAGES SHOULD BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES WITHOUT HARRASSMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SALARIES OF THE EMPLOYEES OF GAZA\'S ISLAMIC </p><p>UNIVERSITY WILL BE PAID IN FULL, WITHOUT </p><p>"DISCRIMINATION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE LEAFLET CONCLUDES WITH A PAEON TO "MUJAHID" </p><p>UNITY AND PRIDE IN ISLAMIC UNITY.  "ISLAM RUNS DEEP IN </p><p>OUR VEINS; IT IS OUR CREED AND LIFE."  ACCORDING TO </p><p>WEEKEND PRESS REPORTS, AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE LEAFLET </p><p>MENTIONED PALESTINIAN CHRISTIAN AS BEING "PARTNERS IN </p><p>THE PROCESS OF SELF-DETERMINATION..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT: THE LEAFLET, WHICH APPEARS TO GIVE GREATER </p><p>STATURE TO HAMAS AND A DEGREE OF PARITY WITH FATAH </p><p>(WHICH IT HAS NOT HAD IN THE PAST), IS WIDELY VIEWED </p><p>HERE AS A REFLECTION OF GAINS MADE BY THE ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES VIS-A-VIS </p><p>THE PLO SECULAR NATIONALISTS FOLLOWING THE BREAKDOWN IN </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE ERUPTION OF THE GULF CRISIS. </p><p>(PRISON BEATINGS OF HAMAS MEMBERS BY FATAH ADHERENTS </p><p>WERE REPORTEDLY A CHRONIC SOURCE OF FRICTION, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE.)  A FATAH MEMBER ACTIVE IN THE DISCUSSIONS </p><p>LEADING UP TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE LEAFLET TOLD A LOCAL </p><p>PALESTINIAN JOURNALIST THAT THE DOCUMENT WAS VIRTUALLY </p><p>DICTATED BY HAMAS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT (CONT\'D): NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE HEARD FROM </p><p>SEVERAL SOURCES THAT THIS "RECONCILIATION" CAN BE </p><p>EXPECTED TO BE SHORT-LIVED.  (ALREADY, THE FATAH YOUTH </p><p>GROUP SHABIBA HAS ISSUED A LEAFLET IN THE VILLAGE OF </p><p>BAL\'A DISMISSING THE "RECONCILIATION" AND CLAIMING THAT </p><p>HAMAS HARRASSMENT OF FATAH LOYALISTS CONTINUES.)  WITH </p><p>FATAH (AND UNLU) WEAKENED AND DIVIDED, HAMAS IS MAKING </p><p>THE MOST OF POPULAR RESENTMENT AGAINST THE U.S. MILITARY </p><p>PRESENCE IN SAUDI ARABIA (AND ALLEGED "DESECRATION OF </p><p>MUSLIM HOLY PLACES") AND ARAFAT\'S FAILURE TO GAIN FROM </p><p>HIS 1988 "CONCESSIONS" ON THE PEACE PROCESS.  ONE </p><p>JOURNALIST TOLD US, "THE NEW GAME IN TOWN IS </p><p>HAMAS-FATAH, NOT ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN."  WE ARE ALSO </p><p>HEARING RUMORS THAT THE SAUDIS AND SOME OTHER GULF </p><p>STATES ARE TAKING REVENGE ON FATAH BY INCREASING FUNDING </p><p>TO HAMAS TO THE TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE PLO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILCOX </p><p></p></div>
