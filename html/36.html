<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIRUT 01351 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  NA </p><p>TAGS:  PINT, PTER, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  HIZBALLAH "MANIFESTO" </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIRUT 1013 </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF ARTICLE WHICH APPEARED IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 23 "MIDDLE EAST REPORTER."  IT SUMMARIZES </p><p>48-PAGE HIZBALLAH TRACT ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 16 (REFTEL). </p><p>EMBASSY HAS REQUIRED ORIGINAL ARABIC-LANGUAGE TEXT OF </p><p>FULL MANIFIESTO, WHICH WE WILL POUCH TO INR AND </p><p>NEA/ARN. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>"HIZBULLAH" DEFINES ITS MILITANT POLICY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>"HIZBULLAH" (PARTY OF GOD) HAS NOW PUBLICLY DEFINED ITS </p><p>POLICY, GOALS AND IDEOLOGY.  AS A GROUP OF FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>SHIITES, THEY ARE DEDICATED TO PROMOT ISLAM ON THE </p><p>PATTERN OF KHOMEINI\'S REVOLUTION IN IRAN.  THEY DERIVE </p><p>THEIR APPELATION FROM TWO KORANIC VERSES WHICH READ: </p><p>(1) "AND WHO SO TAKETH ALLAH AND HIS MESSANGER AND THOSE </p><p>WHO BELIEVE FOR FRIEND (WILL KNOW THAT), LO* THE PARTY </p><p>OF ALLAH THEY ARE THE VICTORIOUS." (SURAH 5/56); (2) </p><p>"THOU WILT NOT FIND FOLK WHO BELIEVE IN ALLAH AND HIS </p><p>MESSENGER, EVEN THOUGH THEY BE THEIR FATHERS OR THEIR </p><p>SONS OR THEIR BRETHREN OR THEIR CLAN.  AS FOR SUCH, HE </p><p>HATH WRITTEN FAITH UPON THEIR HEARTS AND HATH STRENGTHENED </p><p>THEM WITH A SPIRIT FROM HIM, AND HE WILL BRING THEM INTO </p><p>GARDENS UNDERNEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW, WHEREIN THEY WILL </p><p>ABIDE.  ALLAH IS WELL PLEASED WITH THEM, AND THEY ARE </p><p>WELL PLEASED WITH HIM.  THEY ARE ALLAH\'S PARTY, LO* IS </p><p>IT NOT ALLAH\'S PARTY WHO ARE THE SUCCESSFUL.  (SURAH </p><p>58/22-23). </p><p> </p><p>ANNIVERSARY: MARKING THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE </p><p>VIOLENT DEATH OF THE MOSLEM CLERIC SHEIKH RAGHEB HARB, </p><p>THE IMAM OF THE VILLAGE OF JABSHIT IN SOUTH LEBANON, </p><p>"HIZBULLAH" STAGED A MASS RALLY AT THE CHIYAH SUBURB </p><p>SATURDAY, FEB. 16, 1985.  SHEIKH HARB WAS A STAUNCH </p><p>OPPONENT OF ISRAEL OCCUPATION, AND AN ADVOCATE OF </p><p>"HIZBULLAH" AND THE RISE OF A PAN-ISLAMIC "NATION OF THE </p><p>PARTY OF GOD."  HE WAS ASSASSINATED REPORTEDLY BY </p><p>ISRAEL\'S AGENTS IN HIS NATIVE VILLAGE ON FEB. 16, 1984. </p><p> </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFUTE THE </p><p>ACCUSATION THAT IT WAS A HAND OF TERRORISTS.  IT UNDER- </p><p>LINED ITS ALLEGIANCE TO "WELAYAT AL FAQIH" (RULE OF THE </p><p>THEOLOGIAN) UNDER IRAN\'S AYATULLAH RUHALLAH KHOMEINI. </p><p>AMERICA, FRANCE, ISRAEL AND THE PHALANGE PARTY WERE </p><p>DECLARED AS ITS PRIME ENEMIES.  IT DESCRIBED THE PRESENT </p><p>LEBANESE SYSTEM AS "DESPOTIC" AND RENOUNCED THE REGIME </p><p>OF PRESIDENT AMIN GEMAYEL. </p><p> </p><p>OPENING THE MEETING, SHEIKH GHABRIS SAID THAT "HIZBULLAH" </p><p>WAS "MISLEADINGLY DESCRIBED AS A HANDFUL OF FANATICS BENT </p><p>ON KILLING, PLUNDER AND ROBBERY;" AND THAT THEY WERE </p><p>"BLAMED FOR EVERY UNPLEASANT INCIDENT."  "BUT," HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED, "IT WAS "HIZBULLAH" WHICH ACTIVATED THE </p><p>(FREEDOM) FIGHTERS AND EXPELLED THE ENEMY." </p><p> </p><p>MANIFESTO: LATER SHEIKH IBRAHIM AL AMIN READ OUT AT THE </p><p>RALLY A 48-PAGE "MESSAGE" DEDICATED TO THE "MARTYR </p><p>SHEIKH RAGHEB HARB" WHICH WAS TANTAMOUNT TO A MANIFESTO </p><p>OF THE PARTY. (SEE MER OF FEB. 19, PAGE \').  THIS WAS </p><p>THE FIRST TIME "HIZBULLAH" DEFINED ITS MILITANT POSITION </p><p>AND IDEOLOGY SINCE IT MADE ITS IMPACT ON LEBANESE </p><p>POLITICS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  THE MESSAGE IDENTIFIED </p><p>THE MOSLEM FUNDAMENTALIST MEMBERS OF "HIZBALLAH" AS "THE </p><p>CHILDREN OF THE NATION WHOSE VANGUARD IN IRAN WAS </p><p>BESTOWED WITH VICTORY." </p><p> </p><p>"THIS VANGUARD," THE MESSAGE WENT ON, "HAS LAID THE </p><p>FOUNDATION OF A PAN-ISLAMIC STATE UNDER THE WISE GUIDANCE </p><p>OF THE FULLY QUALIFIED FAQIH AYATULLAH RUHALLAH KHOMEINI. </p><p>"HIZBULLAH" MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT HAD NO CARD-CARRYING </p><p>MEMBERS, "BUT IT IS LINKED TO ALL MOSLEMS IN THE WORLD </p><p>BY THE STRONG IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL BOND OF ISLAM." </p><p> </p><p>EAST AND WEST:  THE STATEMENT ATTACKED THE "HAUTY" POWERS </p><p>OF THE EAST AND WEST ALIKE.  IT SAID: "AMERICA HAS TRIED, </p><p>THROUGH ITS LOCAL AGENTS, TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT </p><p>THOSE WHO DESTROYED ITS ARROGANCE IN LEBANON AND FOILED </p><p>ITS CONSPIRACIES WERE BUT A HANDFUL OF FANATIC TERRORISTS </p><p>WHO HAVE NO MISSION BUT TO BLOW UP LIQUOR STORES, </p><p>GAMBLING CASINOS AND AMUSEMENT MACHINES." </p><p> </p><p>THE STATEMENT POINTED OUT THAT SUCH PRACTICES WERE ONLY </p><p>MARGINAL DEALING WITH THE TAIL INSTEAD OF THE HEAD. "WE </p><p>ARE HEADED FOR DEALING WITH EVIL AT THE ROOTS, AND THE </p><p>ROOTS ARE AMERICA," IT SAID, AND STRESSED THAT NOTHING </p><p>WILL TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER FIGHTING THE U.S. </p><p>"HIZBULLAH" BELIEVES THAT BOTH WESTERN CAPITALISM AND </p><p>EASTERN COMMUNISM HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE THE REQUIREMENTS </p><p>OF THE MASSES.  "THE ANSWER LIES IN THE MISSION OF ISLAM," </p><p>IT SAID. </p><p> </p><p>DEMANDS:  THE DECLARATION DEMANDED: 1. COMPLETE EVACUATION </p><p>OF ISRAEL ARMY FROM LEBANON "AS A PRELUDE FOR THE REMOVAL </p><p>OF ISRAEL FROM EXISTENCE AND LIBERATING JERUSALEM FROM </p><p>CLAWS OF OCCUPATION."  2. "AMERICA, FRANCE AND THEIR </p><p>ALLIES MUST LEAVE LEBANON ONCE AND FOR ALL, AND ANY </p><p>IMPERIAL INFLUENCE IN THE COUNTRY MUST BE TERMINATED." </p><p>3. "THE PHALANGISTS MUST BE SUBJECTED TO JUSTICE AND BE </p><p>BROUGHT TO TRIAL FOR ALL THE CRIMES THEY HAVE COMMITTED </p><p>AGAINST THE MOSLEMS AND THE CHRISTIANS WITH ENCOURAGEMENT </p><p>FROM AMERICAN AND ISRAEL."  4. "ALL OUR LEBANESE PEOPLE </p><p>MUST BE GIVEN THE CHANCE OF DETERMINING THEIR FUTURE </p><p>AND CHOOSES THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THEY WANT, BEARING </p><p>IN MIND THAT WE WILL NOT GIVE UP OUR COMMITMENT TO THE </p><p>RULE OF ISLAM." </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL "MARONISM":  THE POLICY OF THE LEADERS OF </p><p>"POLITICAL MARONISM" AS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE "LEBANESE </p><p>FRONT" AND THE "LEBANESE FORCES" MILITIA CAN NEVER </p><p>ACHIEVE PEACE OR STABILITY FOR THE CHRISTIANS, SAID </p><p>"HIZBULLAH".  "IT IS A POLICY BASED ON FANATICISM, </p><p>SECTARIAN PRIVILEGES AND ALLIANCE WITH IMPERIALISM AND </p><p>ISRAEL," IT ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>UNIFIL:  THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE-KEEPING FORCE </p><p>(UNIFIL) OPERATING IN SOUTH LEBANON, IS ACCUSED </p><p>BY "HIZBULLAH" OF STANDING AS A "BUFFER" IMPEDING </p><p>THEIR RESISTANCE AND "MAINTAINING ISRAELI\'S </p><p>SECURITY AND INVADING FORCES."  "HIZBULLAH" </p><p>DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWDOWN </p><p>WITH UNIFIL "IF IT CONTINUED TO CONNIVE WITH THE </p><p>ENEMY." </p><p> </p><p>OTHER ARAB STATES "ANXIOUSLY SEEKING PEACE WITH </p><p>ISRAEL" ALSO CAME UNDER FIRE FROM "HIZBULLAH". </p><p>THEY WERE URGED INSTEAD TO CLOSE THEIR RANKS, </p><p>DEFINE THEIR AIMS PRECISELY AND BREAK THE </p><p>FETTERS RESTRICTING THEIR WILL. </p><p> </p><p>MARCH:  ARMED MEMBERS OF "HIZBULLAH WERE REPORTED </p><p>TO HAVE MARCHED INTO SIDON MONDAY, FEB. 18, </p><p>AND TORE LEBANESE FLAGS AND PICTURES OF PRESIDENT </p><p>GEMAYEL.  (SEE MER OF FEB. 19, PAGE 2).  THEY </p><p>SMASHED A NUMBER OF STORES AND SUPER MARKETS </p><p>SELLING LIQUOR, AND RAISED IRANIAN FLAGS AND </p><p>PORTRAITS OF THE IRANIAN RELIGIOUS LEADER </p><p>AYATULLAH KHOMEINI.  THE ACTION WAS SEEN AS A </p><p>BACKLASH TO THE VISIT TO THE CITY THE DAY BEFORE </p><p>BY PRESIDENT GEMAYEL JEERED BY THE ARMED DEM- </p><p>ONSTRATORS "THE SHAH OF LEBANON". </p><p> </p><p>THE GEMAYELS:  IN ITS STATEMENT, "HIZBULLAH" </p><p>LASHED OUT AGAINST PRESIDENT AMIN GEMAYEL AND HIS </p><p>BROTHER THE LATE BASHIR.  IT SAID:  "THE BUTCHER </p><p>BASHIR HAD REACHED THE PRESIDENCY WITH THE </p><p>HELP OF ISRAEL, THE ARAB OIL PRINCES AND SYCOPHANT </p><p>MOSLEM MPS FLATTERING THE PHALANGISTS." </p><p> </p><p>"THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY AN ATTEMPT TO RECTIFY HIS </p><p>REPUGNANT IMAGE BY AN EXERCISE CALLED THE </p><p>"SALVATION COMMITTEE," WHICH WAS BUT AN </p><p>AMERICAN-ISRAELI BRIDGE USED BY THE PHALANGISTS </p><p>TO ACHIEVE CONTROL OVER THE OPPRESSED PEOPLE. </p><p>HOWEVER, OUR PEOPLE COULD NOT TOLERATE SUCH </p><p>HUMILIATION.  THEY DASHED THE DREAMS OF THE </p><p>ZIONISTS AND THEIR ALLIES.  AMERICA NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>PERSISTED IN ITS FOLLIES AND BROUGHT (PRESIDENT) </p><p>AMIN GEMAYEL TO SUCCEED HIS BROTHER.  THE FIRST </p><p>THING HE DID WAS TO DESTROY THE HOUSES OF THE </p><p>DISPLACED PEOPLE FROM THE SOUTH, DEFILE THE </p><p>ISLAMIC MOSQUES, ORDER THE ARMY TO BOMBARD THE </p><p>DOWN-TRODDAN SUBURB AND DESTRUCT  THE HOUSES </p><p>ON THEIR OCCUPANTS, AND TO CALL IN NATO FORCES </p><p>TO HELP HIM AGAINST US, CONCLUDE THE NOTORIOUS </p><p>17 MAY ACCORD WITH ISRAEL WHICH WOULD HAVE </p><p>TRANSFORMED LEBANON INTO AN ISRAELI PROTECTORATE </p><p>OR AN AMERICAN COLONY." </p><p> </p><p>U.S. AND NATO:  "HIZBULLAH" DECLARED "CLEARLY </p><p>AND FRANKLY" THAT "WE FEAR NO ONE BUT GOD, AND </p><p>WE CANNOT TOLERATE INJUSTICE, AGGRESSION AND </p><p>HUMILIATION."  IT WENT ON TO ANNOUNCE:  "THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND ITS NATO PARTNERS AND THE </p><p>ZIONIST STATE WHICH HAS USURPED THE HOLY ISLAM </p><p>LAND OF PALESTINE, HAVE EXERCISED, AND ARE STILL </p><p>EXERCISING AGGRESSION ON US WITH A VIEW TO </p><p>HUMILIATING US.  WE, THEREFORE, ARE ALWAYS ON </p><p>THE ALERT AND CONSTANTLY GIRDING OURSELVES TO </p><p>REPEL THE AGGRESSION AND DEFEND OUR RELIGION, </p><p>EXISTENCE AND DIGNITY."  END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>LYNE </p><p></p></div>
