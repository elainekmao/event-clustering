<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000116 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA SEEKS CLOSER CHINA TIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: BEIJING 1078 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM RON MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: BILATERAL TIES BETWEEN THE CHINESE AND </p><p>BURMESE GOVERNMENTS SEEM TO BE STRENGTHENING AT ALL LEVELS </p><p>AND ON MANY FRONTS.  FROM THE BURMESE SIDE, THE RECENT </p><p>EXCHANGE WITH THE PRC OF HIGH-LEVEL VISITS EMPHASIZES THE </p><p>FACT THAT BURMA IS BANKING ON DEVELOPING AN ENDURING SPECIAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA.  FROM EMBASSY BEIJING\'S REPORTING, </p><p>IT APPEARS THAT THE PRC HAS A SIMILAR OBJECTIVE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GRANTS, LOANS, AND BOATS </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) FOLLOWING UP ON EMBASSY BEIJING\'S READOUT OF THE </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL EXCHANGE OF VISITS BETWEEN BURMA AND CHINA, WE </p><p>SPOKE WITH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC </p><p>DIVISION DIRECTOR DAW YIN YIN MYINT.  HER ACCOUNT OF THE </p><p>VISITS CORROBORATED BEIJING\'S REPORT REGARDING THE EMPHASIS </p><p>ON TECHNICAL COOPERATION, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AID, AND DEBT </p><p>RELIEF.  ACCORDING TO DAW YIN YIN MYINT, THE TOTAL DEBT </p><p>FORGIVEN BY THE PRC DURING THE RECENT VISITS WAS ABOUT 640 </p><p>MILLION RMB (ROUGHLY $80 MLN).  THIS IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN </p><p>THE CALCULATION OF $65 MILLION WE MADE BASED ON COPIES WE </p><p>OBTAINED OF THE DEBT RELIEF AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DAW YIN YIN MYINT ALSO DISCUSSED WITH US THE QUESTION </p><p>OF CHINESE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF THE IRRAWADDY RIVER AS AN </p><p>OUTLET TO THE SEA FOR CHINESE MERCHANT VESSELS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>DAW YIN YIN MYINT, THIS PROJECT WAS FIRST DISCUSSED DURING </p><p>CHINESE PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN\'S VISIT TO RANGOON IN DECEMBER </p><p>2001.  HOWEVER, SINCE THEN THERE HAS BEEN NO PROGRESS MADE </p><p>BECAUSE OF FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENTS OVER WHETHER THE RIVER </p><p>WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN INTERNATIONAL WATERWAY (ALLOWING </p><p>CHINESE SHIPS TO FLY THE CHINESE FLAG), OR SIMPLY A CARGO </p><p>TRANSIT ROUTE (REQUIRING THE USE OF BURMESE VESSELS).  A </p><p>CHINESE DIPLOMAT STATIONED HERE ADDED THAT THE MATTER HAD </p><p>BEEN STUCK OVER WHO WOULD PAY FOR THE NECESSARY DREDGING AND </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY TO MAKE THE RIVER FULLY NAVIGABLE FROM </p><p>BHAMO IN SOUTHERN KACHIN STATE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE DELTA </p><p>REGION. </p><p> </p><p>CHINA SEEKS ITS SOUTHWEST PASSAGE </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO DAW YIN YIN MYINT AND OTHER GOB </p><p>OFFICIALS, SENIOR GENERAL THAN SHWE AND THE SPDC ARE </p><p>PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING TIES WITH CHINA\'S YUNNAN, </p><p>AND TO A LESSER DEGREE SICHUAN, PROVINCES.  SINCE DECEMBER, </p><p>MOFA HAS HOSTED THREE DELEGATIONS FROM YUNNAN PROVINCE TO </p><p>DISCUSS CLOSER ECONOMIC AND INVESTMENT TIES, IMPROVED </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE BORDER AREA, AND ALSO "BORDER </p><p>MANAGEMENT" CONCERNS (SUCH AS IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS AND </p><p>COUNTERNARCOTICS). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IT IS CLEAR THAT BURMA VIEWS CHINA AS ITS MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT ALLY IN THE REGION RIGHT NOW.  ALTHOUGH THE SPDC IS </p><p>CURRENTLY COURTING GOOD TIES WITH INDIA, DAW YIN YIN MYINT </p><p>SAID THAT THE BURMESE REGIME IS CULTIVATING A "SPECIAL" </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRC IN HOPES THAT THESE TIES WILL </p><p>STRENGTHEN AND CONTINUE TO BEAR FRUIT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. </p><p> ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THE </p><p>PRC IS VERY INTERESTED IN CLOSER TIES WITH BURMA AS AN </p><p>ECONOMIC OUTLET TO THE SEA AND INTO THE REST OF SOUTHEAST </p><p>ASIA.  THE BURMESE MOFA INSISTS, THOUGH, THAT FROM ITS POINT </p><p>OF VIEW CHINA\'S RECENT ATTENTIONS ARE NOT "AGGRESSIVE" IN </p><p>NATURE, AND THAT THERE IS NO QUID PRO QUO EXPECTED IN </p><p>EXCHANGE FOR THE NEW SOFT LOANS AND ECONOMIC AID. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE FREQUENT OF HIGH-LEVEL VISITS, THE AMOUNT OF </p><p>CHINESE ASSISTANCE AND LENDING TO BURMA, AND THE INCREASING </p><p>BILATERAL CONTACTS AT THE WORKING LEVEL INDICATE A MATURING </p><p>OF THE BURMA-CHINA RELATIONSHIP.  ALTHOUGH AMONG AVERAGE </p><p>BURMANS THERE IS STILL STRONG SUSPICION, AND SOME RESENTMENT, </p><p>OF CHINESE INVESTMENT AND INFLUENCE IN THE COUNTRY, THE TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS SEEM FOR THE TIME BEING TO BE FORGETTING OLD </p><p>RIVALRIES AND BUILDING VERY STRONG ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND </p><p>MILITARY TIES.  SIMILARLY, BURMESE TIES WITH INDIA, THAILAND, </p><p>AND BANGLADESH ARE RAPIDLY EXPANDING IN A NETWORK OF REGIONAL </p><p>SUPPORT THAT HAS HELPED DEFLATE WESTERN EFFORTS AT PRESSURE. </p><p>ONE BURMESE OBSERVER HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE SPDC WAS </p><p>REDOUBLING ITS EFFORTS AT REGIONAL FENCE-MENDING IN PART TO </p><p>BUILD A BUFFER AGAINST WESTERN PRESSURE AND SANCTIONS.  PUT </p><p>SIMPLY, BURMA IS NO LONGER ISOLATED AS IT ONCE WAS.  ON THE </p><p>CONTRARY, EVERY ONE OF ITS NEIGHBORS APPEARS TO BE WORKING </p><p>HARD TO REBUILD TRADE, INVESTMENT, AND INFRASTRUCTURE TIES </p><p>WITH BURMA.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO REMEMBER AS </p><p>WESTERN STATES CONSIDER WAYS OF DIRECTING THE GOB TOWARDS </p><p>CHANGE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MARTINEZ </p><p></p></div>
