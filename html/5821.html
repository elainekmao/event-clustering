WRIGHT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, TU, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT </p><p>WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THIS REPORT WILL PRESENT A TURKISH PRESS SUMMARY UNDER THREE </p><p>THEMES: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p>                         ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MASS APPEALS </p><p>Bush: Another UN resolution not necessary - Turkiye </p><p>American press: U.S. can do without Turkey - Sabah </p><p>U.S.: Take the $26 billion package - Vatan </p><p>Erdogan: U.S. should consider our sensitivities - Milliyet </p><p>Bush: Turkey has no better friend than U.S. - Aksam </p><p>EU wants Iraq intervention under UN umbrella - Hurriyet </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OPINION MAKERS </p><p>Washington steps up pressure: Time is up - Cumhuriyet </p><p>Bush: We are best friends with Turkey -- Radikal </p><p>President Sezer: A second UN resolution essential - Radikal </p><p>U.S. to Turkey: We\'re friends, so decide now - Zaman </p><p>Ankara resists U.S. pressure - Yeni Safak </p><p>200,000 U.S. troops in Gulf region - Cumhuriyet </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FINANCIAL JOURNALS </p><p>Central Bank: Structural reforms to minimize war damages - </p><p>Dunya </p><p>Iraq war will hit global tourism, agriculture - Finansal </p><p>Forum </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Dailies comment that the U.S. is uneasy about the </p><p>tough bargaining with Turkey over economic support in the </p><p>event of a war with Iraq, and claim that the Bush </p><p>Administration wonders whether Turkey\'s demand for $92 </p><p>billion as war compensation is a pretext to shy away from </p><p>cooperation with the U.S.  Papers quote Ari Fleischer as </p><p>stressing that the U.S. will continue to work with Turkey, </p><p>and that President Bush is awaiting Ankara\'s decision.  AKP </p><p>leader Erdogan said on Tuesday that the permission extended </p><p>by Turkey to the U.S. regarding modernization of bases is </p><p>`not irreversible.\'  President Sezer has joined Erdogan in </p><p>`thwarting the American blackmail\' by saying that foreign </p><p>troops would be allowed in Turkey only under a framework of </p><p>international legitimacy.  Erdogan said at his party group </p><p>meeting on Tuesday there are two options Turkey could </p><p>choose: either to shape historical developments, or merely </p><p>observe the course of those developments.  "Hurriyet" claims </p><p>that President Bush has offered to send a letter to </p><p>President Sezer to ease Turkey\'s economic concerns, but the </p><p>Turks insisted on a memorandum of understanding on such </p><p>issues.  Dailies claim that Turkey has presented five </p><p>conditions to the U.S.: </p><p>- U.S. plans regarding the future of Iraq should be shared </p><p>with Turkey; </p><p>- Turkey will not accept divisions along ethnic lines in </p><p>Iraq; </p><p>- The control of northern Iraq, except for Mosul, should be </p><p>left to Turkey; </p><p>- British or Kurdish groups to join the coalition against </p><p>Saddam Hussein should not enter Mosul; </p><p>- Written guarantees by the U.S. are needed for Turkey. </p><p>Prime Minister Gul reportedly said that Ankara is awaiting </p><p>the U.S. response to Turkey\'s demands before taking the </p><p>issue of foreign troop deployment to the parliament. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" reports that the Turkish and U.S. militaries </p><p>will command their own troops in northern Iraq through a </p><p>structure of close coordination.  Only U.S. troops will </p><p>enter Mosul, and Turkey will send observers there, papers </p><p>report. </p><p>IMF postpones departure: The IMF delegation now in Turkey is </p><p>reportedly awaiting the outcome of negotiations between the </p><p>U.S. and Turkey before finalizing its fourth review. </p><p>Completion of the review will bring $1.6 billion to Ankara. </p><p>Dailies speculate that talks with the IMF are deadlocked due </p><p>to the ongoing bargaining about deployment of U.S. troops in </p><p>Turkey, and that the U.S. is using its influence on the IMF </p><p>to step up pressure on Ankara.  The IMF delegation, chaired </p><p>by Turkey Desk Chief Kahkonen, held meetings with economic </p><p>officials on Tuesday, and discussed the budget and primary </p><p>surplus target for 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Better stand against both the war and Saddam" </p><p>Mehmet Barlas wrote in mass appeal Aksam (2/19): "By </p><p>standing only against the US military action, people are </p><p>encouraging Saddam and others like him.  Therefore, the </p><p>Saddam regime considers Chirac, Schoreder, and the anti-war </p><p>masses as its allies. . Turkey should think about the </p><p>benefits of an Iraq with or without Saddam, both for Turkey </p><p>and for all of humanity.  Recent history tells us about the </p><p>consequences of having despotic regimes in Turkey\'s </p><p>immediate neighborhood. . In the example of today\'s Iraq, </p><p>neither Kurds, nor Shiites nor Turkomen are safe and secure. </p><p>We still don\'t know exactly how many intellectually </p><p>brilliant Iraqis were killed only because of their </p><p>opposition to Saddam.  Saying `no\' to war is well and good, </p><p>yet it requires a certain degree of intellectualism to be </p><p>able to say `no\' to both a war and to Saddam." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Racing against time" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (2/19): "The time </p><p>factor has become even more important right now, </p><p>particularly in Turkish-American relations, and we have </p><p>observed that very critical point over the last couple of </p><p>days.  This period will be the test of whether or not Turkey </p><p>will ask authorization for the deployment of US troops.  If </p><p>not, Turkey and the US will go their separate ways on a </p><p>possible Iraq operation.  Yet both sides remain hopeful </p><p>about reaching an agreement eventually.  It indeed is a </p><p>possibility that all the issues will be put on paper and a </p><p>settlement will be achieved by this weekend or early next </p><p>week.  When that happens, the procedure for parliamentary </p><p>approval will also begin. . As AKP leader Erdogan duly </p><p>noted, history in the region is about to be re-written.  It </p><p>is a matter of preference for Turkey whether it gets </p><p>actively involved in this historic process or remains </p><p>outside of it." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
