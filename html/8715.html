(SBU) On June 13, the Ambassador discussed Turkey,s </p><p>planned opening to Iraqi imports, the Delta ) SOMO fuel </p><p>barter arrangement, and resumption of air links with Iraq </p><p>with Finance Minister Unakitan.  Econoff discussed Turkish </p><p>lifting of Iraq sanctions with Kaya Turkmen, MFA Deputy </p><p>Director General for Bilateral Economic Relations, and with </p><p>Tevfik Mengu, the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat,s Director </p><p>General for Agreements, the same day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lifting Sanctions on Imports from Iraq </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Unakitan told the Ambassador that he had met with </p><p>the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the State Minister for </p><p>Foreign Trade, and the Interior Minister on June 11 at the </p><p>direction of the Prime Minister to resolve problems at the </p><p>Habur Gate.  Unakitan stated that the barter of gasoline and </p><p>liquid petroleum gas for Iraqi crude oil would go forward, </p><p>and that MFA would send a letter to Foreign Trade to enable </p><p>Delta Petroleum to begin implementing the barter arrangement. </p><p> Unakitan in fact invited the Delta Petroleum General </p><p>Director to attend part of the meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>and suggested that Delta follow up with MFA and the Foreign </p><p>Trade U/S.  Unakitan raised the issue of KDP levies on </p><p>Turkish trucks entering Iraq.  The Ambassador responded that </p><p>the KDP had recently cut its fees to USD 20 per truck, based </p><p>on information we had received (but not confirmed). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Turkmen told Econoff that MFA had sent a letter to </p><p>the Prime Ministry June 13 requesting issuance of </p><p>instructions to all relevant GOT bodies to open the Habur </p><p>border crossing to Iraqi imports.  Turkmen believes this will </p><p>be implemented sometime during the week of June 16.

(SBU) Mengu confirmed that Foreign Trade had received </p><p>MFA,s letter on Delta, but insisted that there would be no </p><p>special deal for Delta.  Mengu maintained that Delta would be </p><p>able to implement its barter arrangement when Turkey lifted </p><p>remaining sanctions on Iraqi imports.  He predicted that this </p><p>would happen within several days.  Mengu also raised the </p><p>issue of KDP taxation of Turkish trucks, but stated that </p><p>Turkey,s opening to Iraqi imports was not linked to an end </p><p>to KDP fee collection.  Econoff responded that coalition </p><p>authorities were working toward elimination of customs fees </p><p>at all of Iraq,s border crossings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Aviation </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.
