ON DEC. 30, 1992, AN EXPATRIATE STAFFER FROM </p><p>UNHCR\'S BANJA LUKA OFFICE (STRICTLY PROTECT) MET AT </p><p>UNHCR ZAGREB HEADQUARTERS WITH TDY POLOFF AND HEAD OF </p><p>OFDA DART TEAM .  THE EXPAT HAS PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR </p><p>AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND </p><p>AN AMERICAN PVO IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE STAFFER SAID </p><p>THE FOUR MONTHS SHE WORKED IN BANJA LUKA (SEPTEMBER - </p><p>DECEMBER) SEEMED LIKE FOUR YEARS.  "IT WAS MUCH WORSE </p><p>THAN THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR."  ACKNOWLEDGING </p><p>DISAGREEMENT WITH USG POLICIES IN EL SALVADOR, THE </p><p>UNHCR STAFFER SAID THE SERB FORCES\' KILLING, RANDOM </p><p>VIOLENCE AND VICIOUS TREATMENT OF BOSNIAN MUSLIMS AND </p><p>CROATS IN THE SO-CALLED SERBIAN REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA </p><p>WAS "EVEN WORSE THAN THE ATROCITIES OF THE SALVADORAN </p><p>DEATH SQUADS." </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02862  02 OF 05  311834Z </p><p>- </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>SERB HARASSMENT INTENSIFIES </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE UNHCR STAFFER SAID THE SERBIAN FORCES SEEMED </p><p>TO HAVE REDUCED THEIR KILLING AND MISTREATMENT OF </p><p>MUSLIMS AND CROATS IN SEPTEMBER FOR SOME UNKNOWN </p><p>REASON.  SHE SPECULATED THAT THEY HAD TEMPORARILY </p><p>BACKED OFF AFTER THE INTERNATIONAL OUTCRY AT SERBIAN </p><p>MASSACRES AND DEATH CAMPS DURING THE SUMMER AND EARLY </p><p>AUTUMN.  HOWEVER, IN EARLY NOVEMBER THE SERBS RESUMED </p><p>THEIR PREVIOUS SEVERE HARASSMENT OF BOTH ETHNIC </p><p>GROUPS.  THE KILLING, VIOLENCE, AND DESTRUCTION </p><p>INCREASED FURTHER IN EARLY DECEMBER.  THE NON-SERBIAN </p><p>POPULATION IS THOROUGHLY TERRORIZED, AS ARE SOME LONG </p><p>RESIDENT SERBS WHO HAVE REFUSED TO BE "MOBILIZED" </p><p>AGAINST THE MUSLIMS AND CROATS.  WHILE THE STAFFER </p><p>HAD NOT RPT NOT HEARD OF ANY NEW LARGE SCALE </p><p>MASSACRES SINCE SEPTEMBER, THE VARIOUS ARMED SERBIAN </p><p>GROUPS KILLED OR WOUNDED PEOPLE SINGLY OR IN SMALL </p><p>NUMBERS EVERY DAY, OFTEN SEEMINGLY AT RANDOM.  THE </p><p>VIOLENCE WAS MUCH WORSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AROUND </p><p>BANJA LUKA, ESPECIALLY WEST AND NORTH OF TOWN.  UNHCR </p><p>HAD ONLY THREE EXPAT AND NINE LOCAL EMPLOYEES IN </p><p>BANJA LUKA WITH ONLY A FEW VEHICLES, SO THEY COULD </p><p>NOT ACCURATELY ESTIMATE CASUALTIES THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>REGION.  THE STAFFER SAID ICRC HAD NINE EXPATS AND 15 </p><p>LOCAL EMPLOYEES AND A NUMBER OF VEHICLES IN BANJA </p><p>LUKA, BUT SHE DOUBTED ICRC HAD SUFFICIENT FREEDOM OF </p><p>MOVEMENT TO ESTIMATE CASUALTIES EITHER. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02862  02 OF 05  311834Z </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>UNHCR LEAVES BANJA LUKA BECAUSE OF DANGER </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.

THE BANJA LUKA </p><p>OFFICE REMAINS OFFICIALLY OPEN AND LOCAL STAFF </p><p>CONTINUE TRYING TO WORK.  THE EXPAT STAFF HAS HAD </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULTY WORKING OVER THE LAST </p><p>TWO MONTHS.  FOR EXAMPLE, SERBIAN "COLONELS" IN BANJA </p><p>LUKA TOLD THE UNHCR STAFF THAT THEY DID NOT NEED </p><p>PERMISSION TO LEAVE TOWN TO OBSERVE HOW UNHCR- </p><p>PROVIDED FOOD WAS BEING DISTRIBUTED OR MISUSED.  BUT </p><p>JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN, SERBIAN GUARDS AT A CHECKPOINT </p><p>WOULD REFUSE THEM PERMISSION TO PROCEED AT ALL OR </p><p>ONLY AFTER LONG, NASTY ARGUMENTS AND INCREASINGLY </p><p>FREQUENT WAVING AROUND OF RIFLES AND PISTOLS.  THE </p><p>STAFFER SAID THAT THE THREE EXPATS BECAME VERY </p><p>FRUSTRATED AS IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO </p><p>MEANINGFUL WORK, EVEN ON AN IRREGULAR BASIS.  MORE </p><p>IMPORTANTLY, SERBIAN "HASSLING" OF UNHCR STAFFERS WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02862  03 OF 05  311835Z </p><p>GROWING UGLIER WITH MORE PUSHING AND SWEARING. </p><p>SERBIAN "SOLDIERS" DID NOT SEEM TO BE FOLLOWING THE </p><p>STAFFERS AROUND, BUT ARMED SERBS WERE ALWAYS AROUND. </p><p>NO SPECIFIC DEATH THREATS HAD BEEN MADE AGAINST THEM, </p><p>BUT IT WAS CLEARLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN IN EARLY </p><p>DECEMBER.  THE UNHCR ZAGREB CHIEF WILL DECIDE IN </p><p>JANUARY WHETHER TO SEND THE EXPATS BACK TO BANJA </p><p>LUKA.  MEANWHILE, THEY ARE TAKING WELL-EARNED LEAVE </p><p>AND GETTING MEDICA ATTENTION FOR INTESTINAL </p><p>PROBLEMS.  THE STAFFER EXPECTS ICRC TO TRY TO REMAIN </p><p>IN BANJA LUKA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>SERBS READY FOR MORE WAR CRIMES </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  A SERBIAN "OFFICER" AT BANJA LUKA TOLD THE UNHCR </p><p>STAFFER THAT THEY WOULD COUNTER THREATS OF U.S. OR </p><p>OTHER AIR STRIKES ON THE AIRFIELD NEAR BANJA LUKA OR </p><p>OTHER MILITARY TARGETS BY DEPLOYING SOME OF THE </p><p>60,000 MUSLIMS AND CROATS IN AND AROUND BANJA LUKA AS </p><p>A HUMAN SHIELD.

THE SERBIAN AUTHORITIES HAD BECOME MUCH TOUGHER </p><p>IN THE LAST MONTH WITH LOCALLY RESIDENT SERBS WHO </p><p>REFUSED MOBILIZATION FOR THE WAR EFFORT.  THE POLICE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02862  03 OF 05  311835Z </p><p>TOOK AWAY IDENTITY DOCUMENTS FROM MILITARY-AGE MEN IN </p><p>BANJA LUKA WHO WERE NOT IN SOME KIND OF UNIFORM.

THE STAFFER SAID THAT IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF </p><p>SERBIAN MILITARY AND PARA-MILITARY PERSONNEL IN BANJA </p><p>LUKA.  THE NEWLY ARRIVED "SOLDIERS" OFTEN SEEM TO </p><p>OPERATE AT CROSS-PURPOSES, AND SOME HEADQUARTERS AND </p><p>UNITS ARE FEUDING WITH OTHERS.  THE MEN WEAR A </p><p>VARIETY OF UNIFORMS.  GUESSING FROM SHOULDER PATCHES </p><p>(WHICH MANY DO NOT WEAR), NEW MEN ARE FROM ABOUT 12 </p><p>MAJOR UNITS OR ORGANIZATIONS, APPARENTLY INCLUDING </p><p>MANY WITH ADMIN OR SUPPORT-TYPE ACTIVITIES. </p><p>DISCIPLINE IN MANY GROUPS IS POOR AND GETTING WORSE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02862  04 OF 05  311836Z </p><p>THE PARA-MILITARY GROUPS ARE THE WORST AND ARE </p><p>GETTING MORE NUMEROUS AS SOME "ARMY" UNITS MOVE OUT </p><p>OF TOWN NEARER THE AIRFIELD OR TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN </p><p>AND WESTERN FRONTS.  MANY OF THE NEW GROUPS </p><p>APPARENTLY ARE FROM SERBIA.  IT IS DANGEROUS JUST TO </p><p>WALK DOWN THE STREET OR EVEN BE IN A BUILDING.  THE </p><p>SERBS ALSO ARE DRAFTING BOSNIAN SERB POLICEMEN OUT OF </p><p>THE TOWN AND SURROUNDING AREAS, SO CRIME RATES ARE </p><p>RISING.  THE POLICEMEN AT LEAST PROTECTED SOME OF THE </p><p>SERBIAN CIVILIANS, NOW THEY TOO ARE BEING VICTIMIZED </p><p>BY THEIR "PROTECTORS." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>MUSLIM RESISTANCE LIMITED TO HIT AND RUN </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  THERE WAS NO LARGE-SCALE ORGANIZED MILITARY </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE SERBIAN FORCES AS FAR AS THE UNHCR </p><p>KNEW.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS SMALL SKIRMISHES AND </p><p>FIREFIGHTS OUTSIDE OF BANJA LUKA, ESPECIALLY IN THE </p><p>WEST, THAT ADD TO THE TOLL OF DEAD AND WOUNDED AND </p><p>DISPLACED.  LOCAL SERBIAN FORCES CLAIMED "MUSLIM </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS AND MERCENARIES" ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>ATROCITIES .
