<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000734 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL:  04/30/13 </p><p>TAGS: CE, MV, AGMT </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 67  (04-30-03) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by E. Ashley Wills, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  PM LETTER TO BALASINGHAM </p><p>-          HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE </p><p>-          SINHALESE CHAUVINIST PARTY\'S THREAT </p><p>-          MAY DAY HOLIDAY </p><p> </p><p>PM LETTER TO BALASINGHAM </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>1. (C) We have received a copy of the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>letter to LTTE chief negotiator Anton Balasingham </p><p>replying to the Tigers\' April 21 pullout from the peace </p><p>talks.  We received the copy late this afternoon and will </p><p>provide an analysis of it to you shortly.  It seems to be </p><p>conciliatory in nature.  We are forwarding a copy of the </p><p>letter to SA/INS via class e-mail.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In other peace process news:  As previously </p><p>reported, it is now out in the press that Balasingham is </p><p>scheduled to visit the Wanni in northern Sri Lanka next </p><p>week.  (Note:  Per Colombo 728, Moragoda was invited to </p><p>by Balasingham to join him in the north next week for </p><p>meetings.)  A Norwegian team was slated to meet with LTTE </p><p>political chief S.P. Thamilchelvam today in the Wanni, </p><p>but we have not yet received confirmation that the </p><p>meeting in fact took place.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>3. (C) FYI.  Pls pass to DRL:  We understand that the MFA </p><p>wants to make our 2002 human rights report on Sri Lanka a </p><p>topic for our annual human rights dialogue.  We\'re not </p><p>sure whom from DRL will lead our side of the dialogue now </p><p>that PDAS Parmly is gone nor when it will take place, but </p><p>we wanted you to know the GSL wants this to be a topic. </p><p>(POL) </p><p> </p><p>SINHALESE CHAUVINIST PARTY\'S THREAT </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Please pass to S/CT:  In a public statement made </p><p>on April 29, a senior member of the extremist, chauvinist </p><p>Sihala Urumaya (SU) party said using suicide bombers </p><p>against the LTTE would be a good idea.  We\'re not sure </p><p>what to make of this.  From what we understand, this is </p><p>the first time that such a threat has emerged from </p><p>Sinhalese ranks.  The SU itself is small and full of </p><p>cranks, but even uttering such threats is serious. </p><p>(POL/RSO) </p><p> </p><p>MAY DAY HOLIDAY </p><p>--------------- </p><p>5. (U) Sri Lanka will be celebrating May Day tomorrow and </p><p>Mission will be closed.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
