<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001325 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENT AWAIT NSC </p><p>MEETING BEFORE DECISION ON U.S. DEPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1207 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1153 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Turkish Parliament has rescheduled for March </p><p>1 -- one day after the powerful National Security Council </p><p>(NSC) meets -- its debate and possible vote on AK Party </p><p>Government\'s draft decision to permit U.S. troop deployment </p><p>through Turkey and deployment of Turkish troops in N. Iraq. </p><p>A decisive NSC recommendation could change the dynamics of </p><p>the deployment decision, but the NSC last month left formal </p><p>responsibility in the Government\'s hands.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>"International Legitimacy":  Who Decides? </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) As the NSC meets and Parliament prepares to debate </p><p>Iraq policy on March 1, the Government is now facing an open </p><p>challenge by President Sezer and Parliament Speaker Arinc, </p><p>who are cooperating on the issue of the constitution\'s art. </p><p>92 international legitimacy clause.  The odd-fellows alliance </p><p>between the Kemalist Sezer and the Islam-oriented Arinc is </p><p>fueling the already pronounced 11th-hour uncertainty and </p><p>promoting further delay in the run-up to the floor debate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Sezer has repeatedly asserted that a second UNSC </p><p>resolution authorizing force against Saddam is necessary to </p><p>achieve the "international legitimacy" necessary for </p><p>Parliament to act.  Arinc declared Feb. 24 that he opposes </p><p>acting on a proposal absent the requisite "international </p><p>legitimacy" as required by art. 92.  Arinc\'s stance resonates </p><p>with the great majority of the AK parliamentary group. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- According to Advanced Strategy Center executive director </p><p>and close observer of State affairs Faruk Demir, Sezer is </p><p>trying to leave the strong impression in the public\'s mind </p><p>that AK Party, both as the government and parliamentary </p><p>majority, bears full responsibility for any consequences of </p><p>an affirmative vote absent a new UNSC enforcement resolution. </p><p> Demir predicted that, if Sezer and the General Staff </p><p>representatives on the NSC try to put additional pressure on </p><p>the government to increase AK\'s internal splits and </p><p>uncertainty, the vote might be delayed beyond March 1. </p><p>-- Murat Yetkin, the influential and well-connected columnist </p><p>for the daily Radikal wrote Feb. 28 that the military has </p><p>reversed course and now signaling its unease about the </p><p>"haste" with which the AK Government brought its petition to </p><p>Parliament.  According to Yetkin, Sezer is trying to "create </p><p>the impression that AK wants to pull the country into war </p><p>over the objections of the military and the President." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>What Next? </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The political ground continues to shift as the various </p><p>players maneuver for tactical advantage: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Akif Beki, a senior correspondent at Islam-oriented </p><p>Kanal-7 news, asserted to us Feb. 28 as Faruk Demir did that </p><p>Sezer\'s comments yesterday amounted to a step back, leaving </p><p>the formal decision completely in Parliament\'s hands.  He </p><p>predicted that the NSC is likely to strengthen GOT\'s hands </p><p>somewhat by underscoring the need to protect Turkey\'s </p><p>national interests -- and that Parliament will pass the </p><p>petition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Former ambassador to Washington Nuzhet Kandemir, now a </p><p>senior figure in right-of-center DYP, opined to us Feb. 28 </p><p>that the NSC will not go beyond its January decision and will </p><p>avoid pushing the GOT or Parliament in a specific direction, </p><p>thus leaving all the public responsibility for the decision </p><p>in the GOT\'s and Parliament\'s (i.e., AK Party\'s) hands.  He </p><p>predicted that Parliament will approve the resolution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Hasan Cemal Guzel, a close advisor to the late P.M. and </p><p>President Turgut Ozal and now a leading columnist for daily </p><p>"Tercuman", and Sevket Bulent Yahnici, a leading figure in </p><p>nationalist MHP and a State Minister in the 1999-2002 Ecevit </p><p>government, rejected Sezer\'s approach on international </p><p>legitimacy in separate discussions with us Feb. 26-27 and </p><p>predicted that the resolution will pass. </p><p>-- Sami Selcuk, recently retired as the Chief Justice of the </p><p>High Court of Appeals, offered to us Feb. 27 that Sezer is </p><p>powerless to formally challenge a parliamentary "decision" -- </p><p>as in this case on Iraq -- before the Constitutional Court. </p><p>Nevertheless, a current senior Supreme Court Justice </p><p>cautioned us Feb. 24 that, if the Parliament violates its </p><p>by-laws or incorrectly applies them "in any way", then Sezer </p><p>will have grounds to take the decision to the Constitutional </p><p>Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Opposition CHP shares Sezer\'s Kemalist outlook and is </p><p>committed to voting en bloc against the Government\'s draft </p><p>resolution.  Offering a representative view, Sukru Elekdag, a </p><p>retired senior diplomat and now a CHP M.P., declared publicly </p><p>that he and his colleagues would not support "America\'s dirty </p><p>war" against Iraq.  He also expressed sympathy and support </p><p>for the Arinc-led anti-war faction in AK.  His public </p><p>comments are more pointed than but not different from those </p><p>he and other senior CHPers, such as former ambassadors Onur </p><p>Oymen and Inal Batu, have made privately to us steadily over </p><p>the past month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- M.P.s in both AK and CHP do not appear to be motivated by </p><p>any concern over a possible financial collapse in the event </p><p>of a no vote.  As reported ref B, Central Bank Governor </p><p>Serdengecti intimated to us that AK in particular does not </p><p>appreciate how serious the situation is, and seems to think </p><p>it can manage its way through without either the U.S. </p><p>assistance or the IMF program.  "Their lack of awareness </p><p>makes me very scared," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On the other hand, Mustafa Gunay, General Secretary of the </p><p>Fethullah Gulen-connected (Islamist) ISHAD businessmen\'s </p><p>association and well connected with Gul, said that the </p><p>Turkish State and Government is fully aware of the economic </p><p>considerations at stake, but the GOT is concerned above all </p><p>by what it perceives as weak USG assurances that an </p><p>independent Kurdish state will not emerge in a post-Saddam </p><p>Iraq.  According to Gunay, Gul and TGS Ozkok share a more </p><p>conciliatory (pro-US) view, but are being stymied by: 1) </p><p>hardliners in the military leadership, including TGS Deputy </p><p>Chief Buyukanit; and 2) FM Yasar Yakis, who shares </p><p>traditionalist Turkish State suspicions of the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We will have to await the NSC decision, due the </p><p>evening of Feb. 28, before being able to assess with more </p><p>precision whether the March 1 debate will lead to a vote or a </p><p>further postponement.  As our contacts suggest, what is </p><p>driving the delay is, ultimately: 1) fear on the part of the </p><p>Turkish State regarding USG intentions in northern Iraq; 2) </p><p>the internal dynamics of the AK power struggle. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
