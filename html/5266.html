<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000117 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CINCSOC - FOR POLAD ROBERT FITTS FROM THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>CINCPAC FOR ADMIRAL FARGO AND COMSOCPAC </p><p>USASFC FOR MG LAMBERT </p><p>USASOC FOR LTG KESSINGER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, MCAP, PREL, PTER, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  AN EXTRAORDINARY TRAINING GROUND FOR U.S. </p><p>SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Dear Bob: </p><p>  I was disappointed to learn that Nepal is not included on </p><p>USSOCOM,s High Value Target List.   As I understand it, if </p><p>Nepal is not on this list, it will be difficult for U.S. </p><p>Special Operations Forces to conduct deployments and training </p><p>here.  I hope I can enlist your support to press for adding </p><p>Nepal as a prime potential training ground for U.S. Special </p><p>Forces. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)   As you know, Nepal has been combating a violent </p><p>Maoist insurgency over the past seven years.  The insurgents </p><p>seek to topple the legitimate Government of Nepal through </p><p>force and set up an old-style Maoist dictatorship.  The </p><p>conflict has grown increasingly brutal and destructive in the </p><p>past year, as the insurgents have intensified their struggle </p><p>and widened their scope of targets to include public </p><p>infrastructure (schools, roads, power stations), </p><p>transportation, and innocent civilians, including children. </p><p>In many ways, Nepal\'s Maoists, who espouse the ideology of </p><p>the Sendero Luminoso and the Revolutionary International </p><p>Movement (RIM), provide a textbook example of classic, </p><p>left-wing domestic insurgencies, while demonstrating violent </p><p>tactics on a par with the Khmer Rouge.   Also classic is the </p><p>Maoists\' anti-Americanism, which continues to threaten our </p><p>interests and affect the security of our personnel and </p><p>facilities in Nepal.   In November the Maoist leadership </p><p>acknowledged responsibility for the assassinations of two </p><p>local Embassy security guards and issued an implicit warning </p><p>to our diplomatic mission to cease anti-Maoist activities. </p><p>The USG is currently reviewing the possibility of adding the </p><p>Maoists to one of its terrorist lists. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)   Obviously, continued instability in Nepal, a </p><p>struggling, impoverished new democracy wedged between two </p><p>huge nuclear powers, could be a recipe for disaster in what </p><p>is already a volatile region.  It is plain to most observers </p><p>that the Government of Nepal will be unable to counter this </p><p>insurgency without significant external assistance.  In </p><p>January 2002 the US Government thus re-oriented its policy </p><p>specifically to support the Government of Nepal in its </p><p>efforts to combat the insurgency through a combination of </p><p>diplomatic efforts, socio-economic aid and security </p><p>assistance, including small arms, force protection equipment, </p><p>NVGs, and training.  The cornerstone of our security </p><p>assistance is a planned Counter-Insurgency center to train a </p><p>Royal Nepal Army (RNA) cadre that will act as a mobile </p><p>training team in Nepal.   These military assistance efforts </p><p>rely heavily on our ability to employ Special Operations </p><p>Forces (SOF), particularly US Army Special Forces.  These </p><p>professionals are uniquely suited to train the RNA,  a </p><p>professional, dedicated and disciplined fighting force that I </p><p>believe will benefit substantially from the instruction </p><p>provided.  In return, our Special Forces would gain </p><p>invaluable experience in rugged, challenging terrain ranging </p><p>from dense jungle to the highest Himalayan Mountains. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  If we continue to exert pressure on the Maoists in </p><p>Nepal, I am confident that it will increase the likelihood of </p><p>a peaceful resolution to this conflict.  USSOCOM forces are </p><p>key in this strategy, and to helping transform the RNA into a </p><p>modern COIN force in the shortest possible time.  I would </p><p>greatly appreciate your support and assistance. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Best regards, </p><p>Mike </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
