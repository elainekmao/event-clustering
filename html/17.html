<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 01 TEHRAN 11319 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12065: GDS 10/25/85 (TOMSETH, VICTOR L.) OR-P </p><p>TAGS: PINT, SHUM, PINR, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: MODERATION:  DOES IT HAVE A CHANCE? </p><p> </p><p>1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY:  THE MODERATE IRANIAN POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH </p><p>WERE ACTIVE DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND WHICH HAVE A </p><p>LONG HISTORY OF OPPOSITION TO THE SHAH, HAVE BEEN PUSHED INTO </p><p>THE BACKGROUND BY THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WHO FOLLOW A </p><p>NARROW AND AUTHORITARIAN INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM. WITHIN THE </p><p>PAST FEW WEEKS, MODERATE GROUPS WHO FAVOR A MORE BALANCED </p><p>SOCIETY RESEMBLING A WESTERN SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY, HAVE BECOME </p><p>MORE VOCAL. WHILE NOT DIRECTLY CRITICIZING AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI, </p><p>THEY HAVE FOCUSED THEIR CRITICISM ON SOME OF THE OBVIOUS </p><p>FAILURES OF THE PRESENT REGIME. THE POLITICAL POSITION OF </p><p>THESE GROUPS IS STILL PRECARIOUS. IT EXPRESSES ITSELF THROUGH </p><p>A FEW SECULAR SPOKESMEN, SOME LIBERAL CLERICS, AND SOME SMALL </p><p>NEWSPAPERS. ALTHOUGH STILL NOT A MAJOR FORCE ON THE IRANIAN </p><p>POLITICAL SCENE, THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ORGANIZE </p><p>THEMSELVES ENOUGH TO EXPRESS IDEAS CONTRARY TO THOSE OF THE </p><p>RULING ESTABLISHMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE ROLE OF SECULAR AND CLERICAL MODERATES -- THE HEIRS IS </p><p>STILL A MATTER OF DEBATE. SINCE THE REVOLUTION FIGURES SUCH AS </p><p>MATIN-DAFTARI NAZIH, FORUHAR, SANJABI, AND BAZARGAN HIMSELF </p><p>HAVE BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY KHOMEINI AND BY HIS ALLIES WHO SHARE </p><p>HIS VISION OF A THEOCRATIC IRAN. NOT ALL OF THESE SUPPORTERS </p><p>OF KHOMEINI ARE CLERICS; THEY INCLUDE THE "SECULAR MULLAHS" </p><p>SUCH AS QOTEZADEH, YAZDI, CHAMRAN, TABATABA\'I AND OTHERS. THIS </p><p>GROUP HAS DOMINATED THE GOVERNMENT, THE PRESS, THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS. IT HAS </p><p>HARRASSED AND IGNORED ITS OPPONENTS. BARZARGAN REMAINS </p><p>POWERLESS; MATIN-DAFTARI AND NAZIH ARE IN HIDING; FORUHAR IS </p><p>IGNORED; AND SAXJABI QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST AND LEFT THE </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>4. ALTHOUGH THE POSITION OF THE MODERATE PARTIES IS STILL VERY </p><p>FRAGILE, IN RECENT WEEKS THEY HAS SHOWN SOME SIGNS OF LIFE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ORGANS, INCLUDING THE NEWSPAPER </p><p>AYANDEGAN AND THE POPULAR HUMOR MAGAZINE AHANGAR, WERE </p><p>SUPPRESSED IN AUGUST, THEY HAVE BEGUN PUBLISHING SMALL PAPERS </p><p>SUCH AS KHALO-E-MOSALMAN (FROM THE MUSLIME REPUBLICAN PEOPLES\' </p><p>PARTY); JONBESH (PUBLISHED BY ALI ASGHAR HAJ SEYYID JAVADI), </p><p>JFBHEH-YE-AZADI FROM THE IRAN PARTY AND AZADI FROM THE </p><p>NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT. ALTHOUGH THE CIRCULATION OF THESE </p><p>PAPERS IS LIMITED AND THEY CARRY MUCH LESS INFLUENCE THAN THE </p><p>THREE MAJOR DAILIES (SAYHAN, ETTELAAT, AND BAMDAD) THEY DO </p><p>OFFER SUBSTANTIAL AND CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON EVENT -- A </p><p>COMMENTARY OFTEN AT VARIANCE WITH THE OFFICIAL VERSION. </p><p> </p><p>5. FOR THE PAST SIX WEEKS, THE MUSLIM REPUBLICAN PEOPLES PARTY </p><p>(MPRP) HAS ORGANIZED FRIDAY AFTERNOON MEETINGS AT ITS TEHRAN </p><p>HEADQUARTERS. ALTHOUGH THE FIRST MEETING ATTRACTED ONLY ABOUT </p><p>100 PEOPLE, EMBASSY POLITICAL OFFICER AND POLITICAL ASSISTANT </p><p>ATTENDED OCTOBER 19 MEETING AND FOUND AN OVERFLOW OF OVER 1500. </p><p>THE CROWD WAS LARGELY MIDDLE-CLASS AND WELL-EDUCATED. THERE </p><p>WERE MANY WOMEN, SOME VEILED, A FEW CLERICS. THE SPEAKERS </p><p>INCLUDED AHMAD ALIZADRH, THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE MPRP, </p><p>AND KAHMATULLAH MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I, LEADER OF THE RADICAL </p><p>MOVEMENT AND EAST AZARBAIJAN DELEGATE TO THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>MOVEMENT AND EAST AZARBAIJAN DELEGATE TO THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>EXPERTS. ALTHOUGH THE AUDIENCE AND SPEAKERS HAD NO AFFECTION </p><p>FOR THE OLD REGIME, THERE WERE FEW MENTIONS OF AYATOLLAH </p><p>KHOMEINI, AND NO ANTI-AMERICAN STATEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE SPEAKERS ELICITED THE GREATEST RESPONSE BY THEIR </p><p>ATTACKS ON AKHUNDBAZI (CLERICAL MEDDLING), ON THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>EXPERTS, AND ON ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A THEOCRATIC </p><p>DICTATORSHIP THROUGH THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIM. ONE OF THE SPEAKERS </p><p>FOUND THE CROWD\'S PULSE WHEN HE SAID, "WE WANT THE ISLAM OF DR. </p><p>SHAR\'IATI; WE DON\'T WANT THE ISLAM OF ........)" AND LEFT THE </p><p>END EMPTY FOR THE CROWD TO FILL IN. BOTH MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I </p><p>AND ALIZADEH WERE CRITICAL OF THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIH. THE LATTER </p><p>SAID, "THIS CLAUSE IS AN ACT OF TREASON AGAINST FUTURE </p><p>GENERATIONS OF IRANIAN PEOPLE. WE HAD A REVOLUTION NOT TO </p><p>PREPARE THE GROUND FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF DESPOTISM." sPEAKING </p><p>PRIVATELY AFTER THE MEETING, MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I SAID THAT EVEN </p><p>THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP HAS NOW REALIZED THAT IT WILL NOT BE </p><p>ABLE TO SELL THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIH TO THE IRANIAN PEOPLE IN ITS </p><p>PRESENT FORM. "THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS HAS DECIDED TO REOPEN </p><p>DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE. I HOPE THAT SOME KIND OF IMPROVEMENT WILL </p><p>BE POSSIBLE." </p><p> </p><p>7. THE MODERATES, IN CRITICISING VELAYAT-E-FAQIH, HAVE FOUND </p><p>SOME ALLIES AMONG CLERICS SUCH AS AYATOLLAHS NURI AND SHARI\'AT- </p><p>MADARI WHO SHARE THE VIEW THAT SUCH AN INSTITUTION, IF NOT </p><p>PROPERLY DEFINED, COULD LEAD TO A DICTATORSHIP. ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>INTERESTING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAS BEEN THE ENTRANCE OF </p><p>AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI\'S SON, HOJJAT AL-ISLAM AHMAD KHOMEINI, INTO </p><p>THE DEBATE ON THIS SUBJECT. IN THESE DEBATES, THE YOUNG </p><p>KHOMEINI HAS TAKEN A POSITION WHICH HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE </p><p>MODERATE VIEW THAT VELAYAT-E-FAQIH, AS DEFINED BY THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION, CONTAINS SOME DANGEROUS AMBIGUITIES. EMBASSY WILL </p><p>DISCUSS THIS QUESTION IN MORE DETAIL IN SEPARATE MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>8. IN PART, RECENT OUTSPOKENNESS OF THE MODERATES CAN BE </p><p>ATTRIBUTED TO DISILLUSION WITH SOME ASPECTS OF THE REVOLUTION -- </p><p>ESPECIALLY TRENDS TOWARD AUTHORITARIAN, CLERICAL RULE. THE </p><p>MODERATES HAVE ALSO TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S OBVIOUS </p><p>MISHANDLING OF CERTAIN ISSUES TO ATTRACT ALLIES BEYOND THE </p><p>NORMALLY MINISCULE CONTITUENCY OF GROUPS SUCH AS THE RADICAL </p><p>MOVEMENT, THE IRAN PARTY, AND TEH NATIONAL FRONT. FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>THE OBVIOUS FAILURE OF A MILITARY POLICY IN KURDESTAN HAS </p><p>BROUGHT CALLS FOR RECONCILIATION, EVEN BY FIGURES WITHIN THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS. A COLUMNIST IN THE NORMALLY CONSERVATIVE </p><p>ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TEHRAN TIMES HAS URGED THE WITHDRAWAL OF NON- </p><p>KURDISH GUARDS FROM THE REGION; THE TUDEH PARTY PAPER MARDOM, </p><p>STUNG BY ACCUSATIONS OF SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN KURDESTAN, HAS </p><p>CALLED FOR A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT. ONLY THE RIGHT-WING ISLAMIC </p><p>REPUBLICAN PARTY, THROUGH ITS ORGAN JOMHURI-YE-ISLAMI, HAS </p><p>CONTINUED TO REFER TO THE KURDISH INSURGENTS AS "AMERICAN </p><p>MERCENARIES". HOWEVER, THE IRP HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ISOLATED </p><p>IN ITS POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO ENSURE PERSONAL SECURITY, ITS </p><p>CRUDE ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP, AND SCANDALS INVOLVING THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY COURT SYSTEM -- LARGE-SCALE BRIBERY AND THEFT </p><p>INVOLVING NO LESS A FIGURE THAN FORMER TEHRAN PROSECUTOR </p><p>AYATOLLAH AZARI-QOMI HIMSELF -- HAS ALSO WIDENED THE APPEAL OF </p><p>THE MODERATE MESSAGE. THE PAPER AZADI OF OCTOBER 18 PRINTED A </p><p>BITTER ATTACK ON THE REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE SYSTEM ACCUSING IT </p><p>OF IGNORING THEFTS BY ILYAVI, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PROSECUTOR- </p><p>GENERAL HADAVI, WHILE SENDING PROSTITUTES AND SMALL-TIME DRUG </p><p>SMUGGLERS TO THE FIRING SQUAD. THE RECENT ATTACK ON TWO </p><p>JOURNALISTS AT THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS BUILDING LED THE ULTRA- </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT PAPER ETTELAAT OF OCTOBER 22 TO WRITE A STRONG </p><p>FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL ENTITLED "LET US NOT REPEAT MISTAKES", </p><p>POINTING OUT THAT THE PEOPLE OF QOM AND TABRIZ REBELLED IN THE </p><p>SHAH\'S TIME BECAUSE FOR DECADES THEY HAD BEEN DENIED THE RIGHT </p><p>TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>10. WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS ADD UP TO? MOST IMPORTANT, THE </p><p>MODERATES OF THE IRAN PARTY, THE NATIONAL FRONT, AND OTHER </p><p>GROUPS ARE ONCE AGAIN FINDING THEIR VOICE AND BEGINNING TO SPEAK </p><p>OUT. IN DOING SO, THEY WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME SEVERAL MAJOR </p><p>OBSTACLES: </p><p> </p><p>-   A) THE MEDIA REMAIN FOR THE MOST PART IN THE HANDS OF THEIR </p><p>OPPONENTS. JOMHURI-YE-ISLAMI BECOMES MORE RABID BY THE DAY, AND </p><p>THE OTHER MAJOR PAPERS ARE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS. THE RADIO AND THE </p><p>TELEVISION, UNDER QOTEZADEH\'S OPPORTUNISTIC AND UNENLIGHTENED </p><p>GUIDANCE, RARELY DEVIATES FROM ITS DAILY MENU OF PSEUDO- </p><p>RELIGIOUS DRIVEL INTERSPERSED WITH PSEUDO-REVOLUTIONARY DRIVEL. </p><p> </p><p>-   B) ALL INTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN TAINTED BY KHOMEINI\'S </p><p>DENUNCIATIONS. HIS FAMOUS AUGUST DECLARATION THAT "WE DO NOT WANT </p><p>INTELLECTUALS" IS STILL REMEMBERED. HIS DIATRIBES AGAINST WESTERN </p><p>DECADENCE HAVE MADE ALL WESTERN MANIFESTATIONS, INCLUDING </p><p>NICETIES, SUSPECT IN HIS FOLLOWERS\' EYES. </p><p> </p><p>11. THESE MODERATE GROUPS STILL LEAD A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE ON </p><p>THE FRINGES OF IRANIAN POLITICAL LIFE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY </p><p>ARE LEFT ALONE TO HOLD THEIR MEETINGS AND PUBLISH THEIR </p><p>NEWSPAPERS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED IRRELEVANT TO THE POLITICAL </p><p>PROCESS. HOWEVER, IN HIS MOST RECENT SPEECHES, KHOMEINI HAS TAKEN </p><p>NOTE OF THEM AND HAS CRITICIZED THEM HARSHLY FOR THEIR ATTACKS ON </p><p>VELAYAT-E-FAQIH AND ON THE CLERGY. IN A SPEECH TO TEHRAN RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERS ON OCTOBER 20, KHOMEINI REFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE MPRP </p><p>MEETING, SAYING, "RECENTLY, IN ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS, ONE OF THESE </p><p>MISGUIDED ONES, WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ISLAM, SUGGESTED THAT THE </p><p>COUNCIL OF EXPERTS SHOULD BE DISSOLVED. AND THE REST CHEERED... </p><p>YOU, WHO DID NOT EVEN PARTICIPATE IN THE VOTING (FOR THE COUNCIL) </p><p>HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY THIS... IT WAS THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO GAVE </p><p>YOU (OPPONENTS OF VELAYATI-E-FAQIH) THE FREEDOM TO SAY WHATEVER </p><p>YOU WANT TO SAY. YOU WERE IN HIDING WHEN THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS </p><p>WERE STRUGGLING AGAINST THE SHAH AND HIS FATHER. NOW YOU WANT TO </p><p>DISSOLVE THE ASSEMBLY?... YOU DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO. I </p><p>WILL SLAP YOU IN THE MOUTH. STOP THIS AND JOIN THE RANKS OF ISLAM </p><p>AND LET THIS COUNTRY PUT ITSELF IN ORDER." </p><p> </p><p>12. KHOMEINI\'S ATTACKS ON THIS GROUP ARE STILL ONLY WORDS AND ARE </p><p>UNLIKELY TO TAKE THE FORM OF ALL-OUT REPRESSION INVOLVING THE </p><p>CLOSING OF NEWSPAPERS, THE BANNING OF MEETINGS, AND THE ARREST OF </p><p>LEADERSHIP. MANY OF THESE GROUPS AND THEIR LEADERS HAVE </p><p>DISTINGUISHED RECORDS OF OPPOSITION TO THE MONARCHY - RECORDS WHICH </p><p>ARE DIFFICULT TO IGNORE. HOWEVER, THE HARD-LINE CLERGY AND ITS </p><p>ALLIES HAVE BEEN ISOLATING AND ATTACKING INDIVIDUAL TARGETS FROM </p><p>AMONG THE MODERATES SUCH AS ??AZIH, METEN-DAFTARI, AND FORUHAR. </p><p> </p><p>13. AS THE AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO MISHANDLE MATTERS SUCH AS ARAB- </p><p>IRANIAN RELATIONS, PROVINICIAL AFFAIRS, AND REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE, </p><p>THE MESSAGE OF THESE MODERATE GROUPS COULD ATTRACT A WIDER </p><p>FOLLOWING. PERHAPS THEY COULD FORCE SOME CONCESSION TO THOSE WHO </p><p>DO NOT SHARE THE IMAM\'S VISION OF AN IRAN RULED IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>THE TEACHINGS OF THAT SPECIALIZED VIEW OF ISLAM HELD BY ONE SECTOR </p><p>OF A MINORITY SECT OF THAT RELIGION. </p><p> </p><p>14. IN THE LONGER TERM, IF THESE GROUPS CAN PRESERVE SOME </p><p>COHERENCE THEY MAY PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE TO A CLERICAL MONOPOLY </p><p>OF POWER IN POST-KHOMEINI IRAN. AT THAT TIME THEIR REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>CREDENTIALS MAY BECOME VERY IMPORTANT; BUT FOR THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>FUTURE, THIS GROUP WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE ON THE PERIPHERY OF </p><p>IRANIAN POLITICS -- ARTICULATE, INTERESTING, BUT WIELDING LITTLE </p><p>REAL POWER. </p><p> </p><p>LAINGEN </p><p></p></div>
