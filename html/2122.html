<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002786 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF/W AND AF/RA </p><p>INR FOR ROANE </p><p>AF/W FOR PARKS, EPSTEIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/30/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PTER, KISL, PHUM, KIRF, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: RADICALIZATION OF ISLAM IN NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) SECSTATE 177569 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Charge Timothy Andrews, for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  The Embassy interprets a "radical </p><p>formulation of Islam" (reftel) as one which deems violence </p><p>against Americans as licit for reasons of faith.  Few in </p><p>Nigeria have adopted this extreme view; however, there is </p><p>widespread concern and significant anger among Muslims in </p><p>Nigeria against the U.S. action in Afghanistan.  Sympathy for </p><p>UBL is visible, particularly among the young, male, Northern </p><p>urban underclass. On the whole, Nigerian Muslims are not </p><p>anti-American, or anti-Western, yet may suspect us of being </p><p>anti-Islamic and view our military action as confirmation. </p><p>If military operations are prolonged or marred by growing </p><p>civilian casualties, this belief will harden.  If this </p><p>dynamic takes root, many Muslims, particularly young </p><p>marginalized males and the more outspoken clerics, will </p><p>become susceptible to a radicalized view of Islam that not </p><p>only promotes violence, but also explicitly rejects Western </p><p>ideals of a secular polity and market-oriented economy. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>View From the Ground </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU)  Most Nigerian Muslims condemn the 9/11 attacks but </p><p>many also oppose coalition action in Afghanistan as an attack </p><p>against fellow Muslims.  The majority hold the U.S. </p><p>responsible for having created the atmosphere that produces </p><p>terrorists through policies they perceive as anti-Islamic in </p><p>Iraq and the Middle East peace process.   Many are skeptical </p><p>about any evidentiary link between the September 11 attacks </p><p>and Usama Bin Laden.  Our failure to provide a public account </p><p>of our evidence seems to them to confirm their suspicions. </p><p>More moderate Islamic leaders, in addition to publicly </p><p>condemning the attacks, and tacitly acknowledging the </p><p>necessity of some type of military response, have voiced </p><p>concerns about how these events might affect Islam as a </p><p>whole.  In a nutshell, our military action in Afghanistan is </p><p>seen by many as the latest example of superpower </p><p>heavy-handedness in the Islamic world. </p><p>--------- </p><p>The Media </p><p>--------- </p><p>3. (SBU) There is no newspaper or other media outlet in </p><p>Nigeria that has a "radical Islamic editorial policy," </p><p>meaning that it encourages Muslims to attack Americans. </p><p>However in mostly Muslim northern Nigeria, numerous </p><p>editorials criticized U.S. policy.  There have also been </p><p>columns supporting Bin Laden, which increased dramatically </p><p>after air strikes commenced.  Two newspapers--the Northern </p><p>states\' government owned New Nigerian in Kaduna and The </p><p>Daily/Weekly Trust in Abuja--have prominently featured </p><p>critical columns. The critical sentiment shades their news </p><p>reports.  The Daily/Weekly Trust is new, so it does not have </p><p>an established track record against which to measure its </p><p>anti-American print.  The New Nigerian, however, opposed </p><p>Desert Storm, so its spin on September 11 is consistent with </p><p>its previous work.  Though new, Trust is far more widely read </p><p>than the New Nigerian,  The Federal Government-owned Federal </p><p>Radio Corporation Nigeria (FRCN) in Kaduna also airs highly </p><p>critical opinions of U.S. policy. </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Islamic Preaching/Teaching </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU)  Many Northern states have adopted versions of </p><p>expanded Shari\'a law in the past two years.  While this </p><p>movement was based on local considerations, it was also, in </p><p>part, a rejection of a dysfunctional secular legal system. </p><p>Nevertheless, the Shari\'a law movement has no direct link to </p><p>growing distress at our bombing of Afghanistan.  Strong </p><p>rhetoric critical of U.S. military action has been used by a </p><p>small but steadily increasing number of clerics, and some of </p><p>these have also advocated for expanded Shari\'a.  Among the </p><p>strongest statements was one from the Zamfara State </p><p>Commissioner of Religious Affairs calling for Muslims to pray </p><p>for the "annihalation" of the U.S. if it invades Afghanistan. </p><p> Yet, by and large, most clerics reflect as well as help </p><p>shape mainstream Muslim views.  They decry the terrorist </p><p>attacks, but in the same breath oppose our reaction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  If radicalism emerges in Nigeria, a focal point </p><p>would be Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, a long-time center </p><p>of Islamic activism.  Zaria based Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky, </p><p>leader of Nigeria\'s Muslim Brothers, relishes being known as </p><p>a militant and would be a likely candidate to push Nigerian </p><p>Muslims toward radicalism.  However, both Zakzaky and his </p><p>movement lost support because of his opposition to the </p><p>adoption of "partial" Shari\'a law under a secular government. </p><p> The Ullama, particularly in Kano, could also emerge as a </p><p>catalyst for radical Islam. </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Political Parties </p><p>----------------- </p><p>9. (SBU)  There is no political party that advocates Islamic </p><p>radicalism in Nigeria. </p><p>----- </p><p>NGO\'s </p><p>----- </p><p>10. (C)  Prominent Islamic NGO\'s include the Red Crescent, </p><p>International Islamic Relief Organization, International </p><p>Federation of Islamic Students Organization and the </p><p>Federation of Muslim Women of Nigeria.  All have ties to </p><p>Saudi Arabia but none appear tied to Islamic radicalism. </p><p>Transnational organizations, such as the Islamic Call </p><p>Society, also have offices in Nigeria.  Cataloguing all </p><p>Islamic NGOs operating in Nigeria and determining their </p><p>political orientation exceeds our limited resources. </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Financial Institutions </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>11. (SBU)  The former BCCI operated in Nigeria, and its </p><p>Nigerian assets are now controlled by the Lagos-based AIB </p><p>Bank.  Post has no information linking AIB, or any other </p><p>bank, to radical Islamic activism. </p><p>------------- </p><p>Foreign Study </p><p>------------- </p><p>12. (SBU)  Most Nigerian Muslims who study abroad go to the </p><p>U.S., U.K., Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, Libya and Iran, in </p><p>descending order of popularity.  Those who wish to study in </p><p>an Islamic country and who are seeking technical or medical </p><p>degrees lean toward Saudi Arabia, while those pursuing </p><p>Islamic studies gravitate to Egypt.  Many professionals are </p><p>reluctant to return here for economic reasons, but religious </p><p>scholars tend to return after their course of study.  After </p><p>completion of their studies, they are likely to preach or </p><p>take up positions as Ullama or teachers.  We expect a more </p><p>militant bent from many of those who studied in Libya, Sudan </p><p>or Iran, but there is no evidence of a violent radicalism </p><p>being brought back to Nigeria. </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Foreign Itinerants </p><p>------------------ </p><p>13. (C)  Post does not have knowledge of individual foreign </p><p>itinerants promoting a radical, i.e. violently anti-American, </p><p>formulation of Islam in the North.  There are a substantial </p><p>number of itinerant Islamic scholars from the Sudan who </p><p>reside in or visit Nigeria regularly.  Algerian and Iranian </p><p>religious scholars resident in Katsina and Kano have also </p><p>been reported.  Malam Yakubu Musa, a Muslim cleric residing </p><p>in Katsina, was recently arrested and then acquitted of </p><p>harboring Algerian radicals alleged to be affiliated with the </p><p>FSPC.  While we do not have specific knowledge, we would </p><p>expect many of these Ullama to be among the most vocal and </p><p>militant "street clerics" and likely candidates for fomenting </p><p>radicalism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  There have been no rumors of planned attacks by </p><p>Muslims against USG installations or Amcits.  That said, if a </p><p>European or American were to wander into an anti-U.S. </p><p>demonstration he or she could well be targeted.  Muslim FSNs </p><p>have expressed concern and mistrust for Ibrahim Zakzaky. </p><p>They warn that while he stops short of preaching that </p><p>violence against Americans is justified by Islam, some of his </p><p>followers may be more radical. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C)  Comment:  Nigeria is struggling with its own ethnic </p><p>and religious conflicts, independent of recent world events. </p><p>However, world events do exacerbate internal ethnic and </p><p>religious tensions.  On the whole, Nigerian Muslims are not </p><p>anti-American, or anti-Western, but are unhappy over US </p><p>military action in Afghanistan.  The fact that our forces do </p><p>not target civilians means nothing to Nigerian Muslims as </p><p>long as our munitions are killing civilians.  Some Nigerian </p><p>Muslims view bombardment that results in collateral (Muslim) </p><p>civilian deaths as not substantially different from terrorist </p><p>attacks that deliberately target (American) civilians.  The </p><p>longer our military action is prosecuted in Afghanistan, and </p><p>if significant civilian casualties continue to mount, this </p><p>anger will only increase.  In time, it could give vent to a </p><p>more radical expression of Islam in some parts of the </p><p>country.  End Comment. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
