(U) In the last week, the local English dailies </p><p>reported on three labor strikes, two in Dubai and one </p><p>in Abu Dhabi. All three labor stoppages involved the </p><p>nonpayment of wages by contracting firms and resulted </p><p>in the intervention of the UAE Labor Ministry to </p><p>mediate a resolution between the parties. The Ministry </p><p>dispatched a legal consultant and inspectors to review </p><p>each complaint and negotiated settlements that </p><p>provided immediate payment of a portion of the wages </p><p>and an installment plan for the rest, in addition to </p><p>regular salary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Comment: Similar work stoppages and </p><p>resolutions have occurred periodically in both Abu </p><p>Dhabi and Dubai, though they are not technically </p><p>sanctioned by law (see reftel). Ministry officials </p><p>generally are sympathetic to the workers\' plight and </p><p>negotiate a quick settlement. In addition to these </p><p>informal dispute resolution mechanisms, the government </p><p>is also proceeding with legislation permitting the </p><p>creation of unions.  This week\'s strikes -- and </p><p>subsequent resolution by the MOL -- are just the </p><p>latest examples of the UAEG\'s ongoing efforts to </p><p>improve labor standards countrywide. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
