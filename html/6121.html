<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001401 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE; </p><p>NSC FOR AMB. KHALILZAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, CASC, ASEC, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: KDP ANKARA OFFICE ATTACKED, NO INJURIES, MINOR </p><p>DAMAGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Ankara staff member Omar </p><p>Merani called Operation Northern Watch POLAD early March 5 to </p><p>report that the night of March 4, the building housing the </p><p>KDP\'s Ankara office was attacked with two molotov cocktails. </p><p>Merani said one of the bottles exploded against the exterior </p><p>wall and left some burn marks but did no visible structural </p><p>damage.  The other bottle broke through the window of KDP </p><p>Ankara rep Safeen Dizayee\'s office but failed to explode.  No </p><p>one was injured in the incident.  Merani, who lives in the </p><p>building with his family, said he had no idea who had done </p><p>this and was not aware of the attack until he woke up this </p><p>morning and found the burn marks and bottle pieces.  Merani </p><p>and his family are AmCits and intend to report this incident </p><p>to the Consulate\'s ACS unit.  Merani said he would be </p><p>contacting the Turkish MFA this morning to report the </p><p>incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The attack is almost certainly linked to hightened </p><p>tensions between Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds (and the KDP in </p><p>particular) over statements made by the Turkish FM that </p><p>Turkey would send troops to northern Iraq to disarm the </p><p>Kurds, the declaration of the Salahadeen Iraqi opposition </p><p>conference opposing Turkish military intervention in northern </p><p>Iraq, and an anti-Turkey demonstration in Irbil March 3 at </p><p>which Turkish flags were burned. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
