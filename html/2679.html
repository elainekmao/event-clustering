<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000979 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EFIN, ECON, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ABUJA WEEKLY REVIEW: MARCH 18-22 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>MONEY CRUNCH AT THE STATE LEVEL </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Because of shrunken government revenues due to lower </p><p>world oil prices, most State governments have become cash </p><p>strapped. Some have not paid civil servants since January. </p><p>Wage costs grew exponentially in May 2000 when the minimum </p><p>civil servant wage was increased from N3,500 to N7,500/month </p><p>(USD 64).  High oil prices in 2000-2001 brought in sufficient </p><p>money to satisfy the higher wage bill.  However, today\'s </p><p>lower oil prices and OPEC quota cuts have reduced federal </p><p>allocations to the States, leaving many States unable to meet </p><p>their obligations including paying both State employees and </p><p>pensioners. Civil servants around the country are grumbling </p><p>and there has been talk of a strike if the problem is not </p><p>resolved soon.  In addition, many State governments have </p><p>frozen new recruiting, leaving more job-seekers unemployed </p><p>and on the streets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment: A strike by civil servants could be severely </p><p>damaging both politically and economically. Unfortunately, </p><p>resolution will not be very easy.   Given government spending </p><p>priorities as they now stand (which includes the siphoning of </p><p>funds for personal or political uses in some States), there </p><p>simply is not enough money to pay everyone\'s salaries.  This </p><p>insufficiency will be exacerbated by electoral pressure to </p><p>spend money in other areas.  However, astute State governors </p><p>will make salary payments a top priority for the simple </p><p>reason that people, not money-guzzling projects, vote.  Civil </p><p>servants and their families tend to be more favorably </p><p>disposed toward the incumbent who pays than the one who does </p><p>not. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Justice Minister Agabi\'s Controversial Sharia Letter </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In a much-publicized March 18 letter, recently </p><p>appointed Justice Minister Kanu Agabi intensified the debate </p><p>over Sharia. In his letter, the Justice Minister requested </p><p>the twelve governors in the States that have enacted criminal </p><p>Sharia not to impose penalties against Moslems that could not </p><p>be imposed against non-Moslems under the secular criminal </p><p>code.  Clearly, the letter was written with Safiya Husseini\'s </p><p>case in mind as the appellate decision reversing her </p><p>conviction was still a week away when Agabi penned the </p><p>letter.  Agabi probably believes his letter nudged the Sokoto </p><p>court to reverse the stoning verdict. Others probably think </p><p>the reversal came notwithstanding the letter, which they </p><p>considered incendiary and counter-productive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Hauwa Ibrahim, an attorney for Safiya, told Emboff </p><p>that the Agabi letter was bad lawyering, and even worse </p><p>politics.  She characterized the letter as unnecessary legal </p><p>posturing that did not carry any force of law despite its </p><p>portentousness.  The Justice Minister could have sued for a </p><p>declaratory judgment if he really wanted to cure the </p><p>disparity between the punishments proscribed by the two </p><p>bodies of criminal law.  For a non-Muslim to write such a </p><p>letter "in order to protect Muslims," as Agabi claimed, was </p><p>condescending; it meant that Muslims had to be protected </p><p>against themselves.  Ibrahim\'s predictions that criticism </p><p>would follow the letter proved right. Predictably, </p><p>temperamental Zamfara State Governor Sani upbraided Agabi and </p><p>vowed that he would not change his State\'s Sharia </p><p>legislation.  Even moderate Kaduna State Governor felt </p><p>compelled to criticize the Justice Minister for encroaching </p><p>into the ambit of the States.  Niger State Governor Kure </p><p>challenged Agabi to forego letter writing and contest the </p><p>constitutionality of Sharia in court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: In addition to the letter, Information </p><p>Minister Jerry Gana told the press that the GON was forced to </p><p>take a more proactive stance against Sharia to prevent </p><p>Nigeria from becoming a human rights pariah.  Some in the GON </p><p>may think that Agabi\'s and Gana\'s interventions helped tip </p><p>the balance in the Husseini case.   However, these statements </p><p>probably had little effect on the Husseini court.  By </p><p>connoting that the North\'s brand of Sharia is atavistic, and </p><p>even brutal, the GON statements will make concession by the </p><p>Northern states on this issue more difficult. Harsh </p><p>statements from the Federal Government will only antagonize </p><p>Northern politicians and diminish the political space in </p><p>which Northern moderates can maneuver to amend criminal </p><p>Sharia as currently implemented to comport more closely with </p><p>universally accepted human rights tenets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) Additionally, the Federal Government probably is </p><p>underestimating the popularity of Sharia with the Northern </p><p>electorate. Every dig at Sharia from the Executive Branch </p><p>further estranges the Obasanjo Administration from a large </p><p>segment of the Northern Muslim population. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>ELECTORAL LAW TO GO TO THE PRESIDENT AGAIN </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The joint Senate/House harmonization committee </p><p>passed the recycled Electoral Act; the bill is now on its way </p><p>to the President to sign into the law.  The new measure </p><p>expunges the controversial prohibition against new parties </p><p>contesting the national and state elections in 2003.  It also </p><p>keeps the three-stage sequencing of elections: presidential, </p><p>state then local.  However, that sequence may change as the </p><p>Governors\' suit contesting the constitutionality of the </p><p>Electoral Law passed last December.  The State Executives are </p><p>challenging the National Assembly\'s right to change the date </p><p>of local government elections from April 2002 to 2003, thus </p><p>extending the local government officials\' tenures in office </p><p>by a year, will be decided by the Supreme Court on March 28. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) With April approaching, many elected local government </p><p>officials worry that Governors in their states may ignore the </p><p>Electoral Law that was passed in December (this version </p><p>extended local government tenures to 2003) and remove them </p><p>from office because their terms were originally to expire </p><p>next month.  In an effort to discourage Governors from this </p><p>action, the National House of Representatives passed a </p><p>resolution that the Governors lacked the constitutional </p><p>authority to dissolve the local government councils in April. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Association of Local Government of Nigeria </p><p>(ALGON) has filed suit against the Governors seeking to </p><p>enjoin them from removing local officials.  ALGON also has </p><p>stated its intention to form a "grassroots" political party </p><p>more responsive to the average citizen than the currently </p><p>registered political associations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ELECTORAL PREPARATIONS -- NIL </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Civil servants are not alone in the queue waiting for </p><p>payment. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) </p><p>has not received the funds President Obasanjo promised </p><p>earlier this year.  Without these funds, INEC can neither </p><p>prepare for nor conduct voters registration.  If the funds </p><p>are not soon forthcoming, INEC may not be able to conduct </p><p>registration in a timely enough manner to prepare for </p><p>elections in early 2003. As things now stand with INEC </p><p>preparations and funding, it would be very difficult to </p><p>envision the development of a new voters registration list in </p><p>time to conduct local government elections in 2002.  This </p><p>could be a big problem should the Supreme Court endorse the </p><p>Governors\' contention that the Electoral Act\'s postponement </p><p>of local government elections from 2002 to 2003 is </p><p>unconstitutional. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Justice Minister Agabi and INEC have announced that </p><p>they will be cooperating with security forces to identity </p><p>politicians and political groups that sponsor violence. </p><p>Guilty individuals and groups will be barred from </p><p>participating in the elections. If implemented effectively </p><p>and impartially, this injunction could be a healthy tonic. </p><p>Agabi cited violent groups like the Bakassi Boys and OPC as </p><p>examples.  By any objective standard, these groups need to be </p><p>contained. However, according to some press reports, Agabi\'s </p><p>statement also mentioned the Arewa Consultative Forum, the </p><p>North\'s leading organization of intellectuals and luminaries, </p><p>as a vigilante group that must register with the security </p><p>forces or face the ban on electoral activity. While Arewa is </p><p>no fan of the Administration, it also is a far cry from the </p><p>OPC. In fact, the ACF has been actively mediating the </p><p>Tiv-Jukun feud in Benue. Perhaps an argument can be made that </p><p>some ACF figures are suspected of encouraging unrest and </p><p>discord.  However, painting the entire organization with the </p><p>same brush as the OPC and others, the Administration falls </p><p>liable to being accused of using the anti-violence campaign </p><p>as a subterfuge to bridle its most influential Northern </p><p>critics.   (Comment: With his statement on Sharia and his </p><p>reference to the ACF, the new Attorney General certainly has </p><p>gotten off on the wrong foot with the North.  Less certain is </p><p>whether he is playing the role of Obasanjo\'s foil or is he a </p><p>loose cannon.  End comment.) </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
