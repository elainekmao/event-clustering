<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000753 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREF, NP, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: CHINESE AMBASSADOR PRESSURES GON TO ARREST </p><p>TIBETANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 715 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, for reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) At an April 25 meeting with Home Secretary Tikka </p><p>Datta Niraula, Ambassador Malinowski raised the issue of </p><p>twenty-one Tibetans, including eleven minors, recently </p><p>arrested on immigration charges (reftel).  The Ambassador </p><p>encouraged the Government of Nepal (GON) to release the </p><p>detainees into UNHCR custody, in accordance with prior </p><p>practice and the unwritten "gentleman\'s agreement" that has </p><p>governed GON treatment of transiting Tibetan refugees since </p><p>1990. In response, Niraula stated that the Chinese Ambassador </p><p>personally had made a high-level presentation to complain </p><p>about the group, and had accused members of the group of </p><p>being involved in unspecified criminal activities. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  UNHCR has confirmed that two of the youngest </p><p>children (ages six and nine) have been released from jail </p><p>without fine, and that a second six-year-old will be released </p><p>today.  Eight minors remain in jail.  (Note: Reftel reported </p><p>that the children being released were not accompanied by </p><p>parents.  New information from UNHCR indicates that the </p><p>father of the second six-year old boy is in custody.  End </p><p>note.)  The Department of Immigration has offered no </p><p>explanation to UNHCR for the detention of the refugees. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment:  Information from the Home Secretary </p><p>confirms Post\'s suspicion that the Chinese Embassy has been </p><p>behind the recent crackdown on Tibetan refugees by the GON. </p><p>It is not clear if the Chinese pressure is the result of </p><p>directives from Beijing, or is a local initiative.  Post will </p><p>continue to encourage the GON to work in cooperation with </p><p>UNHCR and to release the refugees from detention. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
