Per reftel requests, Post passed information regarding </p><p>seminars on specialized intellectual property courts and </p><p>enforcement programs hosted by the United States Patent and </p><p>Trademark Office (USPTO) to Director of Intellectual </p><p>Property Camilo Bendeck.  According to Bendeck, the Central </p><p>American Economic Integration System (SIECA) is funding the </p><p>travel expenses for one Honduran prosecutor to attend the </p><p>seminar on specialized intellectual property courts from </p><p>September 12-13.  Attendance at future trainings will depend </p><p>on the availability of SIECA funding.  Note that SIECA </p><p>(located in Guatemala) is funded by USAID\'s regional G-CAP </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p>2.  With respect to the questions posed in ref a, </p><p>specialized intellectual property courts do not exist in </p><p>Honduras.  After a November 2001 meeting with Emboffs, </p><p>Attorney General Roy Medina designated one prosecutor to </p><p>handle IPR cases exclusively.  The prosecutor is currently </p><p>assigned to the Office of the Special Prosecutor for </p><p>Organized Crime.  The creation of a special prosecutor for </p><p>intellectual property will be based on the Office of the </p><p>Attorney General\'s budgetary needs.  To address the need for </p><p>prosecutors schooled in intellectual property matters, the </p><p>GOH Office of Intellectual Property is assisting in training </p><p>a number of select prosecutors from the organized crime </p><p>office. </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
