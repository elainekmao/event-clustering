<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001097 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL, EUR/SE </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OIA, AFMLS, AND NDDS </p><p>TREASURY FOR FINCEN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, SNAR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY:  2002 END USE MONITORING REPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Turkey is a major transit route for Southwest Asian </p><p>heroin moving to European markets. Turkish law enforcement </p><p>agencies attach a high priority to interdiction, although </p><p>they face serious resource constraints in keeping up with the </p><p>technology traffickers use in their operations and </p><p>communications.  Turkish agencies continue to use INL-funded </p><p>equipment.  This equipment and INL-funded training furthers </p><p>the mission of DEA, which relies on close cooperation with </p><p>Turkish counterparts but lacks operational assistance </p><p>funding.  INL has not provided assistance to Turkey beyond FY </p><p>1999, since the GOT did not accept language regarding human </p><p>rights in the FY 2000 Letter of Agreement.  Remaining INL </p><p>funds in the amount of $50,000 should be exhausted in 2003. </p><p>Mission officers conducted several End Use Monitoring (EUM) </p><p>trips in 2002, to ensure that equipment provided under our </p><p>annual USD $500,000 (appropriations given until 1999) </p><p>counter-narcotics program was properly used and maintained. </p><p>Post successfully worked with Turkish agencies in 2002 to </p><p>disburse funds from previous years.  In 2002, Post procured </p><p>$825,000 in equipment and training for GOT agencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Strategic Overview: </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.    Turkey, largely as a result of its geographical </p><p>position, is a major transshipment point for Southwest Asian </p><p>opiates to European markets.  European governments estimate </p><p>that 75 percent of the heroin coming into Europe either </p><p>transits Turkey or is handled by Turkish criminal </p><p>organizations in Central Europe.  Turkish law enforcement </p><p>agencies focus their efforts on stemming this traffic, by </p><p>stopping it at Turkey,s eastern and western border gates, </p><p>and by destroying illicit laboratories within Turkey which </p><p>process smuggled raw materials into heroin. In March 2002, </p><p>Turkish authorities seized 7,454 kilos of morphine base as a </p><p>result of a DEA-Turkish Jandarma joint investigation.  This </p><p>was the largest seizure of morphine base ever in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.    Turkey is one of the two traditional producers of opium </p><p>authorized by the UN to provide raw material for the </p><p>international pharmaceutical market. Licit opium is produced </p><p>by the Turkish Grain Board (TMO), which has taken significant </p><p>steps since 2000 to improve opium yields in its crop. There </p><p>is no appreciable cultivation of illicit narcotics in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Given these strategic conditions, bilateral </p><p>counter-narcotics cooperation plays an important part in our </p><p>overall relationship with Turkey.  Turkey did not sign a new </p><p>Letter of Agreement (LOI) in 2000 to extend further </p><p>counter-narcotics assistance, due to language regarding human </p><p>rights in the draft LOI.  Narcor is working to complete </p><p>disbursement of funds remaining from previous years, and </p><p>estimates that all INL funding will be exhausted in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The Embassy provided $825,000 in anti-narcotics commodity </p><p>assistance and training to Turkish law enforcement and drug </p><p>authorities in 2002.  Post extended this assistance and </p><p>related training to: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     Turkish Grain Board (TMO) - $420,000 for  equipment to </p><p>test poppy seeds in producing new drugs for its licit poppy </p><p>program; $234,000 for a seed processing/cleaning and </p><p>packaging machine. </p><p>     Turkish Customs Border Guards - $157,000 for ion </p><p>scanners; $2,000 for digital cameras. </p><p>     Turkish Jandarma - $1,600 for video cameras; $1,600 for </p><p>digital cameras; $3,500 for undercover transmitters and </p><p>communications systems. </p><p>     Turkish National Police (TNP) & Turkish Customs Boarder </p><p>Guards - $5,100 for the continued English language courses. </p><p>     ANATEM Drug Research and Treatment Center ) located in </p><p>Istanbul, this center has received INL funds in past years </p><p>but did not receive any procurements in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EUM Trips: </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Embassy officials conducted several monitoring trips in </p><p>2002.  Embassy officials conducted one end use monitoring </p><p>trip to Istanbul, as well as several visits to TNP </p><p>headquarters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Istanbul </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Econoff conducted an end-use monitoring trip to Istanbul </p><p>in August 2002, visiting Nihat Kubus, the Chief of the </p><p>Technical Unit for the Turkish National Police (TNP) in </p><p>Istanbul.  Kubus provided econoff and accompanying DEA </p><p>officer a tour of the facilities, including the storage room </p><p>for equipment.  He said all of the U.S.-provided equipment </p><p>was accounted for, and the Istanbul TNP still used some of </p><p>this equipment.  For example, still in use were radios </p><p>provided from 1988-2002, telescopic cameras provided in 1989, </p><p>GPS equipment provided in 2002, actuators provided in 1992, </p><p>and a fiberscope provided in 1989.  Kubus said some of the </p><p>equipment supplied by INL, such as the bullet proof vests </p><p>which the U.S. provided in 1990, were no longer usable either </p><p>because the shelf life had expired or it was no longer </p><p>technically adequate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Kubus said he believed the INL program had been valuable, </p><p>as it allowed the TNP to purchase high-tech equipment it </p><p>would not otherwise be able to purchase.  However, he </p><p>complained, he felt that TNP Ankara needed to coordinate more </p><p>closely with TNP Istanbul before it ordered equipment.  Kubus </p><p>said it would be useful if he had more input into the </p><p>decision-making process, as his equipment needs were </p><p>sometimes different than those in Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ankara </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.    Econoff and DEA officer visited Mustafa Gokcimen, </p><p>Director of the TNP,s Technical Unit in Ankara, on August </p><p>14, 2002.  Gokcimen and his technical staff provided a </p><p>demonstration of how the TNP were utilizing the GPS system, </p><p>which was funded by INL in 2000.  Gokcimen said the TNP were </p><p>making good use of the system, using it to track suspected </p><p>drug traffickers.  The system had now been extended to ten </p><p>different cities in Turkey, including Istanbul.  They were </p><p>now working on &mapping8 other cities and on some technical </p><p>modifications to make the GPS system compatible with some of </p><p>the TNP,s other tracking systems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.   Though the direct impact is difficult to calculate, </p><p>Turkish anti-narcotics authorities had several operational </p><p>successes in 2002: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In March, the Turkish Jandarma, working with the DEA Istanbul </p><p>Resident Office and based on intelligence developed by DEA, </p><p>seized 7.5 metric tons of morphine base.  This seizure led to </p><p>the arrest of a DEA priority target. </p><p>DEA and Turkish Counterparts continue to focus on acetic </p><p>anhydride (AA) which is smuggled into Turkey and used to </p><p>convert morphine base into heroin in illicit laboratories </p><p>located in Turkey.   In January 2002, the TNP seized 10,000 </p><p>kilograms of AA in Bursa, Turkey. </p><p>In April, the TNP seized 2 tons of AA from a TIR </p><p>truck/trailer in Istanbul.  The AA arrived in Samsun, Turkey </p><p>from the Ukraine. </p><p>In December, DEA,s Ankara Regional Office,  Moscow, Russia </p><p>Country Office,  the TNP and Russian officials successfully </p><p>conducted an international controlled delivery of 3.5 tons of </p><p>AA from Russia to Turkey.  This investigation led to the </p><p>identification of the AA source of supply in Russia as well </p><p>as the arrest of the transporters, brokers, and end users in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p>In May, as the result of DEA, TNP and Turkish Customs </p><p>cooperative efforts, Turkish Customs seized 93.6 kilograms of </p><p>heroin and arrested a Macedonian national at the Ipsala </p><p>border crossing on the Turkish/Greek border.  The heroin was </p><p>secreted inside the refrigeration compartment of a truck </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>transporting 17 tons of tomatoes from Turkey. </p><p>During 2002, several operational captagon laboratories were </p><p>seized in Turkey.   Fenethylline, which is commonly called </p><p>captagon, is a stimulant traditionally produced in Bulgaria </p><p>and trafficked through Turkey to countries on the Arabian </p><p>Peninsula.  The first seizure of Turkish-produced captagon </p><p>occurred in July 2002, when Turkish authorities seized a </p><p>captagon laboratory and approximately 5-6 million captagon </p><p>tablets.  The Turkish Jandarma seized another two operational </p><p>captagon laboratories in Istanbul in January 2003. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
