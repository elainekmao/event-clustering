<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003010 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR FINCEN -- AHMED ALBASHARI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EFIN, PTER, KVPR, CVIS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: TREASURY QUESTIONS ON TERRORISM FINANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 61381 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  In a conversation with Econ Chief, Malakh Ghanem, </p><p>a senior official in the Central Bank of Jordan banking </p><p>supervision department (effectively the deputy), and her </p><p>staff provided orally the following answers to the questions </p><p>in reftel.  The CBJ\'s answers were developed in consultation </p><p>with CBJ legal staff.  The CBJ is happy to address any </p><p>additional questions, which they suggested be transmitted to </p><p>them by the embassy in order to ensure proper coordination </p><p>within the Jordanian government.  CBJ staff is also </p><p>interested in educational and training opportunities on </p><p>terrorism finance issues.  Since Jordan does not currently </p><p>have a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) or the equivalent, </p><p>they would appreciate information on establishing such a unit </p><p>and on participation in the Egmont Group.  (The CBJ is </p><p>planning to send a representative to an upcoming </p><p>DS/ATA-sponsored course on legislation related to terrorism.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  The following answers are keyed to reftel </p><p>questions. </p><p> </p><p>(1)  The CBJ has issued freeze orders for all thirteen lists </p><p>issued under EO 13224.  Freeze orders are issued via </p><p>circulars that are delivered by the CBJ to Jordanian </p><p>financial institutions on the same day as the embassy </p><p>provides notification of the USG action. </p><p> </p><p>(2)  No.  However, under Jordan\'s anti-moneylaundering </p><p>regulations, financial institutions are required to notify </p><p>the central bank of suspicious transactions.  This occurs </p><p>periodically, but none of those transactions have been </p><p>terrorism-linked. </p><p> </p><p>(3)  No names were excluded. </p><p> </p><p>(4)  Penalties are addressed in Article 88 of the Banking Law </p><p>(law number 28 of 2000).  They include 1) addressing a </p><p>written warning, 2) instructing a bank to submit a </p><p>satisfactory program of measures to eliminate the violation </p><p>and rectify the situation, 3) instructing the bank to cease </p><p>certain activities, or forbidding the bank to distribute </p><p>dividends, 4) imposing a fine on the bank not to exceed JD </p><p>100,000 (usd 140,000), 5) instructing the bank to temporarily </p><p>suspend from service any administrator, other than a member </p><p>of its board of directors, or to dismiss such administrator, </p><p>depending on the gravity of the violation, 6) removing the </p><p>chairman or any member of the board of directors of the bank, </p><p>7) dissolving the board of directors of the bank and placing </p><p>the bank under the management of the central bank for a </p><p>period not to exceed twelve months.  The governor may extend </p><p>the period for up to twelve additional months, and 8) </p><p>revoking the license of the bank. </p><p> </p><p>(5)  No. </p><p> </p><p>(6)  Yes.  Under Article 93 of the Banking Law, financial </p><p>institutions should provide full account information, </p><p>including name of holder, balance, source of funds and any </p><p>other relevant information. </p><p> </p><p>(7)  Article 93 freeze orders apply for 30 days and can be </p><p>extended. </p><p> </p><p>(8)  No. </p><p> </p><p>(9)  Terrorism related assets have not been identified or </p><p>frozen by the CBJ. </p><p> </p><p>(10) Same day (regarding information received from the USG). </p><p> </p><p>(11) Same day. </p><p> </p><p>(12) Assets of Jordanian nationals and residents as well as </p><p>foreign nationals can be frozen under Jordanian law. </p><p> </p><p>(13) There have been no legal challenges.  Challenges would </p><p>be through the judicial system. </p><p> </p><p>(14) Additional evidence can be used to defend against a </p><p>challenge.  The Jordanian legal system can protect sensitive </p><p>information. </p><p> </p><p>(15) Details of terrorism-related arrests have been reported </p><p>through separate channels. </p><p> </p><p>(16) Post will forward copies of the banking law articles 88 </p><p>and 93 (in English), as well as copies of anti-money </p><p>laundering regulations (Arabic), and amendments to the penal </p><p>code criminalizing terrorist related activities, including </p><p>financing (Arabic), to Ahmed Albashari at FINCEN. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
