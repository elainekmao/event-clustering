<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 003555 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p>STATE FOR EB, EB/CBA, AND EB/IFD </p><p>USDOC FOR 3131/USFCS/OIO/ANESA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/MAC/AME </p><p>USDOC FOR 6000/TD/AC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, EINV, ELAB, ETRD, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW CABINET MANTRA: PRIVATE SECTOR WILL ADD JOBS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ADCM John G. Moran for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: With Kuwait\'s population expanding at a rapid </p><p>pace, the new GOK says it will finally turn to the private </p><p>sector in an effort to bolster its economy.  During courtesy </p><p>calls last week with many of the new Ministers, the </p><p>Ambassador was on more than one occasion treated to the GOK\'s </p><p>latest analysis of its economy, which holds that Kuwait will </p><p>face a serious crisis if it does not rapidly expand job </p><p>creation in the private sector for the next generation.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>BURGEONING COSTS </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During their July 26 meeting, the Ambassador and </p><p>Minister of Justice Ahmed Baquer discussed the Kuwaiti </p><p>economy.  Baquer showed the Ambassador a diagram depicting a </p><p>triangle dissected by a horizontal line about 1/3 of the way </p><p>down from its tip.  He explained that the diagram represented </p><p>the current Kuwaiti population, with the portion above the </p><p>line representing those Kuwaitis who were already in the </p><p>workforce, the portion below the line representing those who </p><p>had yet to do so, and the line being the age of majority </p><p>(currently 18).  Baquer said that the GOK has realized that </p><p>it "must create jobs in the private sector" if it wishes to </p><p>avoid high unemployment and massive budget deficits in the </p><p>near future, as the majority of its population comes of age. </p><p>(Comment: 92 - 98% of the current Kuwaiti workforce is </p><p>employed by the GOK in some form or another.  They enjoy the </p><p>benefits of relatively high salaries and very limited work </p><p>hours.  The constitution guarantees Kuwaiti nationals a job. </p><p>Only unexpectedly high oil prices have kept the GOK budget in </p><p>the black the past two years.  End Comment.)  Reinforcing </p><p>this, Baquer shared some statistics.  He said that where </p><p>there had been 1400 high school graduates in all of Kuwait in </p><p>1970, there were 14,000 in 2000, a ten-fold increase. He said </p><p>there were currently 15,000 Kuwaitis waiting for jobs, while </p><p>current government employees were "doing nothing" except </p><p>drawing subsidies for housing, using the government\'s </p><p>generous healthcare benefits and drawing retirement pensions. </p><p> Finally, he said that the government is predicting it will </p><p>have outlays of KD 7 billion for salaries alone in 2017, </p><p>whereas the 2002 figure was KD 2 billion.  Baquer conceded </p><p>the GOK would have a hard time selling any privatization </p><p>measures in Kuwait, due to opposition from National Assembly </p><p>members.  "The MP\'s are against privatization. They call it </p><p>the stealing of Kuwaiti wealth." </p><p> </p><p>HEALTH CARE PRIVATIZATION </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Although Baquer did not share any specific plans for </p><p>reforms by his Ministry, other Ministers did.  During their </p><p>July 27 meeting, Minister of Public Health, Dr. Mohammed </p><p>Ahmad Al-Jarallah shared with the Ambassador his plans to </p><p>allow for the development of private hospitals and health </p><p>insurance.  Jarallah said plans were already in the works to </p><p>allow prominent US medical centers (such as the Mayo Clinic) </p><p>to develop hospitals and sell private health insurance in </p><p>Kuwait.  This would serve the large expatriate labor force by </p><p>introducing lower health care premiums into the market and </p><p>bringing advanced medical technology and care to the country. </p><p> The hope is that this would decrease the number of Kuwaitis </p><p>who currently seek medical treatment outside Kuwait, most of </p><p>them at government expense. </p><p> </p><p>OPENING MARKETS </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Minister of Commerce Abdullah Taweel told the </p><p>Ambassador on July 28 that he had given a presentation to the </p><p>Council of Ministers on how the GOK could liberalize its </p><p>markets and encourage domestic investment.  The presentation </p><p>was well-received, and the GOK decided it would work to </p><p>change decrees and laws currently hampering investment.  The </p><p>Minister said he would work with his colleagues, including </p><p>Minister of Interior Shaykh Nawaf Al-Sabah (Note: The </p><p>Ministry of Interior is responsible for controlling the </p><p>borders. End Note.), to ensure coordination of their efforts. </p><p> "Shaykh Nawaf says the economy is the new focus" now that </p><p>the security threat (i.e. Saddam Hussein) has been removed, </p><p>he said.  Taweel said the government\'s first steps will be to </p><p>renovate and upgrade Kuwait\'s port facilities, work on </p><p>changing food standards in order to allow allow random (vice </p><p>comprehensive) testing of products from source countries </p><p>known to protect their consumers and generally streamline </p><p>bureaucratic procedures.  "We\'re opening the doors to </p><p>everything," he added. </p><p> </p><p>PRIVATIZING HOUSING </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Minister of Public Works and Minister of State for </p><p>Housing Affairs Bader Nasser Hmaidi told the Ambassador on </p><p>July 30 that he will attempt to structure incentives for </p><p>Kuwaitis seeking housing so as to cut government costs. </p><p>"Kuwait is the only country in the world to provide housing </p><p>for its citizens." he said, "but our citizens don\'t make good </p><p>housing decisions." Hmaidi said the GOK has hired a </p><p>consultant and is looking to offer Kuwaitis choices of </p><p>several house sizes and floor plans built by private </p><p>companies on a quasi-B.O.T. basis.  He said Kuwaitis will </p><p>eventually have 5-6 models to choose from, allowing the </p><p>government to rein in the current runaway size and cost of </p><p>Kuwaiti housing. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Hmaidi also said the Ministry of Public Works has </p><p>plans to build a bridge over the Gulf of Kuwait, beginning </p><p>next year, which will connect Kuwait City to the Sabiyah </p><p>area.  Current plans are for a bridge 50 meters above the </p><p>water at its highest point and 22 kilometers long.  In </p><p>addition, the Ministry is planning to expand facilities at </p><p>Shuwaykh Port and Kuwait City International Airport\'s and </p><p>build industrial parks and a port on Bubiyan Island, as well </p><p>as a free-trade zone near the Iraqi border.  Many of these </p><p>projects will be developed with the private sector, he said. </p><p> </p><p>DIRECT INVESTMENT LAW </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) During their July 30 meeting, Minister of Finance </p><p>Mahmoud Al-Nouri told the Ambassador that the Foreign </p><p>Investment Law, which was passed in 2001 but has not yet been </p><p>implemented, is awaiting the resolution of three points by </p><p>the Council of Ministers.  He said he had been instrumental </p><p>in its passage and would work to see it implemented as soon </p><p>as possible.  Al-Nouri shared the Ambassador\'s interest in </p><p>expanding U.S. business activity in Kuwait and proposed a </p><p>fall meeting between the U.S. and Kuwaiti business </p><p>communities to identify further areas of cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Under the terms of a new law, a number of private </p><p>universities have been established over the past year, </p><p>including the American University of Kuwait, headed by the </p><p>well-knon liberal academic and former Director of the </p><p>Washington-based Kuwait Information Office, Dr. Shafeeq </p><p>Al-Ghabra.  In a July 29 meeting, new Minister of Education </p><p>Dr. Rashed Al-Hamad affirmed to the Ambassador that the GOK </p><p>would continue to emphasize such private sector approaches to </p><p>higher education.  This initiative will be aided by new rules </p><p>for foreign suppliers\' offset obligations, which give big </p><p>incentives for investment in education. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The talk of privatization and the opening of Kuwaiti </p><p>markets is heartening, but not altogether convincing given </p><p>the GOK\'s poor track record in the past and the vested </p><p>interest of many Kuwaitis in maintaining the status quo. </p><p>Nonetheless, hopes are higher that Shaykh Sabah\'s new title </p><p>of Prime Minister and the election of a National Assembly </p><p>that should be more amenable to working with the government </p><p>will lead to long overdue reform of the economy and greater </p><p>scope for private sector activity. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
