SUMMARY: IN A MEETING WITH EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR JUDITH </p><p>STROTZ, FORMER SAIGON COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY TRAN </p><p>BACH DANG EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM.  HE ALSO EXPRESSED HIS EXTREME DISAPPROVAL </p><p>OF THE VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT (PENDING BEFORE THE </p><p>SENATE) BECAUSE, HE SAID, IT SINGLES OUT VIETNAM </p><p>UNFAIRLY FROM AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES.  THE CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH DANG, A SENIOR VIETNAMESE STATESMAN, REFLECTED THE </p><p>COMPLEXITIES AND LINGERING AMBIVALENCE IN THE U.S.- </p><p>VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ADVICE FROM THE COMMANDER OF THE SAIGON TET OFFENSIVE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>2. MEETING WITH EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR STROTZ ON OCTOBER 8 </p><p>AT HIS RESIDENCE, DANG SAID HE WAS "SHOCKED" AT THE </p><p>ATTACK ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.  HE SAID THE KILLING </p><p>OF CIVILIANS WAS SIMPLY "UNACCEPTABLE."  THE 75-YEAR- </p><p>OLD DANG, WHO WAS COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY FROM 1965- </p><p>73, TOLD STROTZ THAT IN 1968, HE WAS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF </p><p>OF THE TET OFFENSIVE IN SAIGON AND CHOLON. "WE ATTACKED </p><p>THE U.S. EMBASSY IN SAIGON, BUT WE NEVER CONSIDERED </p><p>THAT TO BE A TERRORIST ACT."  DANG SAID HE SUPPORTED </p><p>THE U.S. FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AND ALSO WOULD SUPPORT </p><p>THE OVERTHROW OF THE TALIBAN IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>3. DANG RECALLED THAT WHEN THE VIET MINH WAS </p><p>CONSOLIDATING ITS POWER IN THE 1950\'S, IT FOUGHT </p><p>SEVERAL BATTLES AGAINST THE HOA HAO BUDDHIST MILITIA IN </p><p>SOUTHERN VIETNAM.  "WE HAD GUNS," HE SAID.  "THE HOA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01183  01 OF 02  170847Z </p><p>HAO HAD ONLY KNIVES AND STICKS."  AFTER KILLING THE </p><p>FIRST WAVES OF HOA HAO FORCES, HE SAID, THE VIET MINH </p><p>REGROUPED, NOT BECAUSE OF LOSSES, BUT BECAUSE "WE FELT </p><p>WE COULDN\'T KILL PEOPLE THAT WAY."  DANG SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>IF U.S. GROUND FORCES LANDED IN AFGHANISTAN, THEY COULD </p><p>FACE A SIMILAR COMPLEX SITUATION.  HE SAID THE U.S. </p><p>SHOULD RELY ON THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE OR ANOTHER AFGHAN </p><p>GROUP TO OVERTHROW THE TALIBAN.  IN A STATEMENT THAT </p><p>SEEMED IRONIC COMING FROM THE VIET CONG VETERAN, DANG </p><p>ECHOED VIETNAM, THE OLD COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF SAID THAT </p><p>WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE AFGHAN PEOPLE, IT WOULD BE </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR THE U.S. TO PREVAIL. </p><p> </p><p>4. NOTING THAT HE WAS MADE AN HONORARY CITIZEN OF </p><p>LUBBOCK, TEXAS AND AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE U.S. </p><p>ROTARY CLUB DURING HIS FIRST VISIT TO THE U.S. IN 1999, </p><p>DANGHE SAID HE HAS MANY AMERICAN FRIENDS.  HE SAID HE </p><p>REGRETTED THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF U.S. LIVES AND ADVISED </p><p>THAT MILITARY ACTIONS IN AFGHANISTAN BE SWIFT BECAUSE </p><p>U.S. SOLDIERS WOULD HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME IN THE AFGHAN </p><p>WINTER.  DANG SAID HE OPPOSES TERRORISM IN ANY FORM, </p><p>INCLUDING ACTS OF TERRORISM BY PALESTINIAN GROUPS OR </p><p>PERSONS.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT HE BELIEVED U.S. </p><p>POLICIES TOWARD ISRAEL VIS--VIS THE PALESTINIANS WERE </p><p>"DANGEROUS."  HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE U.S. SHOULD USE </p><p>ITS POWER TO "RESTRAIN ISRAEL." </p><p> </p><p>5. EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR STROTZ THANKED DANG FOR HIS </p><p>INSIGHTS AND SUPPORT.  SHE ADDED THAT THE U.S. DOES NOT </p><p>WISH TO SEE AFGHAN CIVILIANS KILLED OR INJURED AND THAT </p><p>THE U.S. HAS LAUNCHED A LARGE HUMANITARIAN EFFORT TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01183  01 OF 02  170847Z </p><p>ASSIST THE AFGHAN PEOPLE.  SHE SAID THE U.S. WAS </p><p>LEADING DIPLOMATIC AND FINANCIAL EFFORTS, NOT JUST </p><p>MILITARY EFFORTS, TO FIGHT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>"SHUT THE VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT UP IN A DRAWER" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6. EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR STROTZ ASKED DANG TO EXPLAIN THE </p><p>STRONG REACTION IN VIETNAM AGAINST THE VIETNAM HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ACT (VNHRA) CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE SENATE. </p><p>IN AN OFTEN EMOTIONAL VOICE,  THAT AT TIMES SHOWED </p><p>EMOTION, DANG SAID THE ACT WENT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL </p><p>NORMS AND BEHAVIOR.  "BY ITS VERY NAME, IT SINGLES OUT </p><p>VIETNAM," HE SAID.  HE ADMITTED VIETNAM WAS "NOT </p><p>PERFECT" IN TERMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT NOTED THAT ITS </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD WAS NOT POOR IN COMPARISON TO OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>7. ACCORDING TO DANG, VIETNAM FOUGHT UNTIL 1975 TO </p><p>OBTAIN THE MOST BASIC OF HUMAN RIGHTS - INDEPENDENCE. </p><p>HE SAID ANOTHER BASIC HUMAN RIGHT WAS HAVING ENOUGH TO </p><p>EAT.  IN 1944-45, TWO MILLION VIETNAMESE DIED OF </p><p>STARVATION UNDER JAPANESE OCCUPATION.  IN COMPARISON, </p><p>HE SAID, TODAY\'S HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS ARE LAUGHABLE. </p><p>VIETNAM\'S LEADERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE ITS </p><p>CITIZENS\' HUMAN RIGHTS, DANG SAID, BUT IMPROVEMENTS </p><p>CANNOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>8. EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR STROTZ DETAILED SOME OF THE </p><p>BACKGROUND OF THE VNHRA.  SHE EXPLAINED THAT SOME </p><p>MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WANTED TO BALANCE THEIR PASSAGE OF </p><p>THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF </p><p>THEIR CONCERN ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS IN VIETNAM.  SHE ALSO </p><p>NOTED THAT THE ACT CONTAINED A PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER TO </p><p>SOME OF ITS MAIN PROVISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>9. DANG WAS NOT IMPRESSED.  HE SAID VIETNAM\'S IS "NOT A </p><p>BARBARIC GOVERNMENT," AGAIN POINTING TO THE TALEBAN, </p><p>BUT THE VNHRA ESTABLISHES THE UNITED STATES AS </p><p>VIETNAM\'S JUDGE IN ITS OWN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT IN THE PAST, POL POT CAUSED "TERRIBLE </p><p>DESTRUCTION," BUT THE U.S. PROTESTED KHMER ROUGE </p><p>ACTIVITIES BELATEDLY.  "BUT WE SHOULD PUT THE PAST </p><p>BEHIND US," HE SAID.  "I SUGGEST THE VNHRA BE SHUT UP </p><p>IN A DRAWER.  INSTEAD, WE SHOULD GIVE EACH OTHER ADVICE </p><p>AS FRIENDS."  HE ADDED THAT VIETNAM WAS WILLING TO </p><p>CONTINUE ITS DISCUSSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS PART OF THE </p><p>NORMAL DIPLOMATIC PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01183  02 OF 02  170848Z </p><p> </p><p>10. AS A FORMER COMMUNIST PARTY LEADER AND CURRENT </p><p>ADVISOR TO THE GOVERNMENT, DANG\'S OPINIONS - GENUINE </p><p>SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM CHECKED BY INDIGNATION TOWARDS THE VNHRA - </p><p>LIKELY REFLECT THOSE OF MANY OTHER OLDER GENERATION </p><p>VIETNAMESE LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  BCLTV DIRECTOR STROTZ DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO CLEAR THIS CABLE BEFORE DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
