<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001330 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IIP/SC AND IPI, IIP/T/ES, AF/PDPA IIP/G/AF, </p><p>INFO AF, AF/RSA, AF/W, NEA/PPD </p><p>LAGOS FOR PAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, SCUL, OIIP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA "ENGAGING ISLAM IN NIGERIA: THE TWO - </p><p>DAY KANO CONFERENCE" - - an analysis </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Abuja </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: In late January an unprecedented </p><p>forum initiated by the Emir of Kano brought together </p><p>Embassy officials, American scholars, and Moslem </p><p>leaders from northern Nigeria to explore perceptions </p><p>of the US and Islam, U.S. Middle East Policy, the </p><p>Global War on Terrorism, and economic development in </p><p>Northern Nigeria. The conference was a frank exchange </p><p>that revealed a wide gap in perspective between the </p><p>American and Nigerian attendees.  Many of the </p><p>Nigerians espoused "clash of culture" and conspiracy </p><p>theories, with the United States being Islam\'s main </p><p>antagonist. The bedrock of their indictment was </p><p>perceived U.S. bias in the Israeli-Palestinian </p><p>conflict. This perception colored every aspect of </p><p>their view of U.S. policy from Afghanistan to West </p><p>Africa. While no minds were changed during the </p><p>meeting, the dialogue helped to loosen positions </p><p>somewhat and also served to show our concern about how </p><p>we are perceived in Northern Nigeria.  The dialogue </p><p>has led to requests for more conferences.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The impetus for this conference was the April </p><p>2002 visit to the U.S. by the Emir of Kano who was </p><p>greatly concerned about the negative image of Nigeria. </p><p>During the conference\'s preparatory stages the focus </p><p>shifted. Instead of focusing on American perceptions </p><p>of Nigeria, we decided to seek the Emir\'s agreement to </p><p>change the focus of the conference to how Northern </p><p>Nigeria sees the United States.  This adjustment would </p><p>allow us to advance a key USG and Mission objective -- </p><p>engaging Muslim opinion-makers on their home turf. The </p><p>Emir and his lieutenants agreed to this reorientation </p><p>and offered to host the conference in Kano for U.S. </p><p>and Nigerian policymakers and opinion leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Clash of Cultures </p><p>----------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) Giving the initial presentation of the </p><p>conference, Dr. Ibrahim Suleiman of Ahmadu Bello </p><p>University set the tone for an energetic exchange by </p><p>claiming that a clash of cultures was inevitable. He </p><p>argued that Islam has been a wholly beneficial </p><p>development in West Africa while Christianity, </p><p>modernity and globalization were negative influences. </p><p>He asserted that the United State had implicitly </p><p>declared war on Islam. Throughout the conference, </p><p>Suleiman and others cited President Bush\'s description </p><p>of the Global War on Terrorism as a "crusade," as </p><p>evidence that America was warring against their </p><p>religion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Embassy staff debunked the notion of a war on </p><p>Islam as well as the thesis that western values and </p><p>globalization were inimical to the "African </p><p>Personality." Dr. Godlas also attempted to refute </p><p>Suleiman\'s position. Speaking as an American Muslim </p><p>and a religious scholar, he stated that American </p><p>"modernism" and Islam have many common themes; thus a </p><p>cultural collision was avoidable but necessitated </p><p>better understanding and a willingness to transcend </p><p>stereotypes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Middle East Policy </p><p>------------------ </p><p>5. (SBU) Middle East Policy: Throughout the session, </p><p>the Nigerian interlocutors pointed to the Israeli- </p><p>Palestinian question as the litmus test of U.S. view </p><p>toward their religion. As long as the U.S. was seen as </p><p>uncritically supportive of Israel, the U.S. would have </p><p>problems in the Moslem world. Additionally, they </p><p>claimed that Islamic countries could not "trust" the </p><p>United States.  They complained the U.S. once </p><p>supported Iraq but was now its mortal enemy.  One </p><p>person went as far as accusing the U.S. of preparing </p><p>to attack Saudi Arabia because it disagreed with U.S. </p><p>on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Nabeel Khoury gave a solid presentation </p><p>outlining the Administration\'s "Roadmap for Peace in </p><p>Middle Eastern."  While the Nigerians commended U.S. </p><p>support for a Palestinian state, they criticized our </p><p>insistence on a new Palestinian leadership.  They also </p><p>voiced skepticism about whether we would use our </p><p>assistance as leverage to pressure Isreal to be more </p><p>flexible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Global War on Terrorism </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Most participants deplored terrorism and </p><p>condemned the September 11 attacks. However, they </p><p>viewed the U.S. war on terrorism -- symbolized by </p><p>military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq -- as </p><p>anti-Islamic. Some said North Korea represented more </p><p>of a threat but was being handled with kid gloves </p><p>because it was not Islamic and was a nuclear state. A </p><p>few claimed that the Global War on Terrorism was a </p><p>ruse to spur the U.S. economy by attacking Islamic </p><p>states with oil reserves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) All the Nigerians claimed that using military </p><p>means to combat terrorism would prove ineffective.  To </p><p>get to the root of the tension, the U.S. has to become </p><p>an impartial arbiter in the Isreali-Palestinian </p><p>conflict. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>U.S. Foreign Policy - Morality in Question </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>9. (SBU) The Nigerian interlocutor contended that U.S. </p><p>foreign policy failed to live up to its democratic and </p><p>human rights underpinnings.  They claimed the U.S. </p><p>supported unpopular regimes in the Middle East because </p><p>of oil.  They also claimed that the U.S. policy in </p><p>Africa has been checkered by indifference and racial </p><p>prejudice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Ambassador Jeter asked how U.S. support for </p><p>the conflict in Bosnia could be reconciled with the </p><p>conclusion that the U.S. was anti-Islamic.  He also </p><p>pointed out that Nigerian Moslems often criticized the </p><p>U.S. but were reluctant to upbraid Islamic states. </p><p>For instance, they were silent on Sudanese government </p><p>mistreatment of southern Sudanese Christians.  The </p><p>Nigerians argued that the Sudan was a "political" </p><p>battle over land and resources, not a religious war. </p><p>They were told that the same description could also be </p><p>applied to the Israeli-Palestinian feud. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Random Perceptions </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Nigerian Participants presented their perceptions of </p><p>the U.S. Unfortunately, a current of anti-Semitism ran </p><p>through many comments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The Jewish lobby has undue influence on USG policy, </p><p>including Middle East policy. In the United States no </p><p>candidate for any national, state or local officer can </p><p>be elected without the support of the all-powerful </p><p>Jewish lobby, said one participant. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Jews were responsible for the September 11 terrorist </p><p>attacks; Jews were told to stay at home on that day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--September 11 attacks were responsible for the Jos </p><p>unrest (though that unrest took place on September 7). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Next Steps and Comments </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) There are two ways to view the conference. </p><p>One is pessimistic; the other is hopeful.  The gulf </p><p>between American and Nigerian Muslim perspectives of </p><p>the world is vast.  The Nigerian participants </p><p>generally represented the mainstream thought in the </p><p>Northern Nigerian community.  Unfortunately, they </p><p>shared a strong inclination for believing the worst </p><p>about America.  Theirs was a selective interpretation </p><p>of history - they tended to give extra significance to </p><p>things they felt showed America\'s anti-Islamic bias. </p><p>Thus, the inordinate focus on President Bush\'s use of </p><p>the word "crusade." At times, this propensity served </p><p>to materially distance their understanding of U.S. </p><p>actions and intentions.  For example, most believed </p><p>the U.S. sided with the French and British during the </p><p>1956 Suez crisis.  Conversely, they gave short to </p><p>shrift to action that showed the United States has </p><p>acted even-handedly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Their collective analysis of the United </p><p>States lacked sufficient objectivity.  Their views </p><p>were the product of a long term diet of anti-American </p><p>disseminations and discussions.  They want to believe </p><p>the United States is an adversary.  Having such a </p><p>powerful adversary provided a convenient excuse for </p><p>many of the ills in their society.  At another level, </p><p>having a strong enemy also helps to validate their </p><p>sense of self-worth. (We must be a potent force or </p><p>else the U.S. would not bother).  In short, having an </p><p>omnipotent adversary fits nicely into their political </p><p>and religious cosmology and helps explain negative </p><p>socio-economic trends in Northern Nigeria.  However, </p><p>this somber interpretation is not insuperable.  Behind </p><p>the rhetoric is a certain respect for America and what </p><p>it stands for.  Whether they say it or not, they wish </p><p>Nigeria could be more like America than it is. Thus, </p><p>there is certain ambivalence in their view of the U.S. </p><p>They mistrust but do not hate us.  They want to be </p><p>like us and want to like us but we must first show </p><p>that we like them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Consequently, we can use this begrudging </p><p>admiration of the United States to help influence </p><p>perceptions in a more positive way.  There are two </p><p>major steps that can be taken.  Our active engagement </p><p>in resolving Israeli-Palestinian crises is sine qua </p><p>non.  While the road map to peace was greeted coolly </p><p>by the Nigerians, they will warm if progress is noted. </p><p>Second, we need to be more active in Northern Nigeria. </p><p>We need to elevate our official presence and </p><p>developmental assistance particular in agriculture and </p><p>education.  The more we have a benign material effect </p><p>in their daily lives, the more we undermine </p><p>perceptions of U.S. indifference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15 (SBU) In the final analysis, the conference was a </p><p>productive opportunity to exchange views on key </p><p>foreign policy issues as well as to discuss </p><p>perceptions of each other.  The meeting did not change </p><p>minds, but it engendered better understanding on some </p><p>issues.  Equally important, the conference was well </p><p>received. Participants have requested future </p><p>conferences on Sharia in Nigeria, the bilateral </p><p>relationship, and West Africa regional issues.  In </p><p>March, U.S. speakers Dr. Gwendolyn Mikell also invited </p><p>the Ciroma of Kano to Washington to speak to the </p><p>Council on Foreign Relations and to Chicago to speak </p><p>to the Third World Scholars Conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Governor of Katsina has agreed to any offer of a </p><p>similar conference in Katsina. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16 (U) This cable was delayed in transmission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
