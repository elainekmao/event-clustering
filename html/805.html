(U) CLASSIFIED BY PETER W. GALBRAITH, AMBASSADOR, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  04931  01 OF 02  051623Z </p><p>REASON 1.5(B) AND (D) . </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  ON DECEMBER 2 A 30-MEMBER CODEL LED BY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES MOLINARI AND LEVIN VISITED ZAGREB TO </p><p>DISCUSS U.S. PARTICIPATION IN IFOR DEPLOYMENT IN BOSNIA. </p><p>THE CODEL MET WITH SRSG KOFI ANNAN AND GENERAL JANVIER, </p><p>AND LATER WITH PRESIDENT TUDJMAN.  JANVIER SAID THE "THE </p><p>WAR IS OVER" AND THE MILITARY SITUATION WAS MUCH IMPROVED, </p><p>THOUGH FIGHTING CONTINUED AND CASUALTIES MUST BE EXPECTED. </p><p>ANNAN AND TUDJMAN DISCUSSED THE IMPORTANCE OF U.S. </p><p>PARTICIPATION.  BOTH SAID SEPARATELY THAT WHILE DANGERS </p><p>EXIST, NEITHER BELIEVES NATO WILL BECOME ENGAGED IN </p><p>RENEWED WARFARE BECAUSE THE SITUATION HAS FUNDAMENTALLY </p><p>CHANGED SINCE ALL SIDES HAVE SIGNED ON TO A PEACE </p><p>AGREEMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>CODEL MOLINARI MEETS ANNAN AND JANVIER </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN A MEETING AT UN PROTECTION FORCE (UNPF) </p><p>HEADQUARTERS, SRSG KOFI ANNAN GAVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ROLE </p><p>OF PEACEKEEPING VERSUS PEACE IMPLEMENTATION.  HE ARGUED </p><p>STRONGLY THAT THE UN HAS LAID A SOLID GROUNDWORK FOR THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTING FORCE FOR BOSNIA.  GENERAL JANVIER DESCRIBED </p><p>THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND EMPHASIZED THAT THERE HAD </p><p>NOT BEEN A COMPLETE HALT TO THE FIGHTING, BUT CURRENTLY </p><p>THE UN ENJOYED FULL FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IN MOST AREAS OF </p><p>BOSNIA, PARTICULARLY IN SARAJEVO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE REPRESENTATIVES ASKED WHETHER THE FRENCH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  04931  01 OF 02  051623Z </p><p>CONTINGENT WOULD BE UNDER NATO COMMAND AND EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN OVER COMMENTS BY FRENCH GENERAL BACHELET CRITICAL </p><p>OF THE U.S. ROLE IN NEGOTIATING THE DAYTON AGREEMENT </p><p>(REF).  ANNAN ASSURED THE REPRESENTATIVES THAT THERE WAS </p><p>NO DOUBT THAT THE FRENCH WOULD BE UNDER THE COMMAND OF </p><p>NATO.  HE SAID THAT GENERAL BACHELET\'S COMMENTS WERE </p><p>UNFORTUNATE AND MARRED HIS OTHERWISE OUTSTANDING RECORD </p><p>(AS THE GENERAL WHO LIFTED THE SIEGE OF SARAJEVO). </p><p>GENERAL JANVIER SAID BACHELET\'S COMMENTS WERE HIS OFF-THE- </p><p>RECORD PERSONAL OPINIONS AND DID NOT REFLECT THE VIEWS OF </p><p>EITHER THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF IFOR AND THE </p><p>TRANSITION FROM UN TO NATO CONTROL, ANNAN TOLD THE CODEL </p><p>THAT THE ENTIRE UN MILITARY COMMAND WOULD BE WITHDRAWN AND </p><p>ALL COMMAND FUNCTIONS WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO NATO.  THE </p><p>ONLY REMAINING UN INVOLVEMENT IN BIH WOULD BE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE, HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORING WITH AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>POLICE TASK FORCE, AND SUPPORT FOR THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>WHO WILL CONTROL CIVILIAN ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>JANVIER: THE WAR IS OVER </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO THE CODEL\'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR U.S. TROOPS GETTING CAUGHT IN RENEWED </p><p>WARFARE, ANNAN SAID THAT THE UN HAD RIDDEN OUT THE MOST </p><p>DANGEROUS PERIOD AND THAT WHILE THERE WERE STILL PERILS, </p><p>NATO TROOPS WOULD FACE A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT </p><p>SITUATION; THERE WAS NOW AGREEMENT BY ALL SIDES TO A PEACE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  04931  01 OF 02  051623Z </p><p>AGREEMENT.  JANVIER SAID "THE WAR WAS OVER," HOWEVER THE </p><p>FIGHTING IS NOT.  BIH WAS STILL DANGEROUS AND THAT MEANT </p><p>THERE WOULD BE LOSSES WHICH TROOP CONTRIBUTING NATIONS </p><p>MUST ACCEPT.  JANVIER EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THERE </p><p>WOULD BE NO LARGE SCALE COMBAT BECAUSE NATO FORCES WOULD </p><p>BE A DETERRENT TO ANY GROUP TRYING TO START A FIGHT. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE WARNED, THERE WOULD BE INCIDENTS AND </p><p>RESISTANCE BY SOME ELEMENTS ON BOTH SIDES AS THEY WITHDREW </p><p>FROM AREAS CURRENTLY UNDER THEIR CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE CODEL ASKED  HOW MUCH CONTROL MILOSEVIC COULD </p><p>BE EXPECTED TO EXERT OVER THE BOSNIAN SERB MILITARY CHAIN </p><p>OF COMMAND.  ANNAN ASSURED THEM THAT MILOSEVIC HAD </p><p>SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT THAT SINCE BOSNIA WAS ENTERING </p><p>A PERIOD OF PEACE, MILOSEVIC MUST COMMENT CAUTIOUSLY IN </p><p>ORDER TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM WAR CRIMINALS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE CODEL WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE ROLE OF </p><p>GENERAL MLADIC AND WHO WOULD REPLACE HIM.  JANVIER OPINED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ7823 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7823 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  04931  02 OF 02  051623Z </p><p>ACTION H-06 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   OASY-00  DS-00    EUR-01   TEDE-00  IO-00    ADS-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   SS-00    DSCC-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------05F285  051623Z /38 </p><p>O 051535Z DEC 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8251 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECPOLAD// </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//POLAD// </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 004931 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/5/00 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV PREL MOPS HR UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  CODEL MOLINARI MEETS SRSG ANNAN, GENERAL </p><p>          JANVIER, AND PRESIDENT TUDJMAN </p><p> </p><p>THAT MLADIC\'S DEPUTY GENERAL GERO IS A LIKELY CANDIDATE, </p><p>BUT IS LARGELY AN UNKNOWN.  HOWEVER, GERO HAD ACCEPTED THE </p><p>DAYTON ACCORD.  REPRESENTATIVES ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  04931  02 OF 02  051623Z </p><p>ABOUT THE MUJAHADEEN AND THE THREAT TO U.S. INTERESTS. </p><p>ANNAN SAID THAT THERE WERE ONLY AN ESTIMATED 700 PRESENT </p><p>IN BIH, INTEGRATED INTO BOSNIAK UNITS. HE SAID IT WAS THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOBH TO GET THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY </p><p>IN THE ONE MONTH SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TUDJMAN </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) WITH HIS TYPICAL HISTORICAL SWEEP, PRESIDENT </p><p>TUDJMAN TOLD THE CODEL THAT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IN THE </p><p>FORMER YUGOSLAVIA WAS THE CLASH OF WESTERN, EASTERN, AND </p><p>MUSLIM CIVILIZATIONS.  THE UNEQUAL BALANCE OF FORCES AMONG </p><p>THEM WAS THE REASON FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF YUGOSLAVIA, BUT </p><p>NOW A NEW BALANCE WAS BRINGING AN END TO THE WAR AND THE </p><p>NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN CROATIA AND SERBIA.  AT </p><p>DAYTON, HE SAID, IT WAS OBVIOUS THE SERBS WANTED AN </p><p>AGREEMENT BECAUSE THEY KNEW THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO WIN IF </p><p>THE WAR CONTINUED.  TUDJMAN ANSWERED CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>DANGER TO U.S. FORCES BY SAYING THAT WHILE SPORADIC </p><p>FIGHTING IS LIKELY, THE SERBS\' DESIRE FOR A SOLUTION WOULD </p><p>TRANSLATE INTO NO SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION TO IFOR. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ASKED ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE FORCE, TUDJMAN </p><p>RESPONDED THAT A LARGE FORCE WAS NOT NEEDED IN EASTERN </p><p>SLAVONIA (ALTHOUGH HE EXPECTED U.S. PARTICIPATION AT THE </p><p>HEAD OF THE TRANSITIONAL ADMINISTRATION), BECAUSE THE </p><p>SERBS HAVE AGREED TO REINTEGRATION.  BOSNIA REQUIRED A </p><p>LARGE PRESENCE, HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE DEEP DIVIDE </p><p>BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND SERBS.  WITHOUT A LARGE FORCE, NEITHER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  04931  02 OF 02  051623Z </p><p>SIDE WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS.  HE SAID THAT UNDER </p><p>CURRENT CONDITIONS THE 5:2:2 ARMS RATIO (FRY:CROATIA:B-H) </p><p>WAS ACCEPTABLE, HOWEVER, A DIFFERENT RATIO MIGHT BE </p><p>NECESSARY LATER. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) CODEL MEMBERS ASKED TUDJMAN ABOUT THE MUJAHADEEN </p><p>PRESENCE AND IF THE GOC WOULD ASSIST IN THEIR </p><p>IDENTIFICATION AND REMOVAL. TUDJMAN SAID IT WAS NOT KNOWN </p><p>HOW MANY ARE PRESENT IN BOSNIA, PERHAPS 3-4,000. HE HAD </p><p>LITTLE DOUBT, HOWEVER, THAT THEY WOULD LEAVE SINCE THEY </p><p>COMMANDED LITTLE TRUST ON THE PART OF LOCAL MUSLIMS.  HE </p><p>OPINED THAT THEY WOULD NOT OPPOSE THE OVERWHELMING FORCE </p><p>OF IFOR.  DEFENSE MINISTER SUSAK ADDED THAT THE GOC WOULD </p><p>"HELP THE MUJAHADEEN LEAVE." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) TUDJMAN SAID THAT THE GOC WOULD COOPERATE WITH </p><p>THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL AS LONG AS THE PROCEEDINGS </p><p>REMAINED UNBIASED.  HE ASSURED THE CODEL THAT THE GOC </p><p>WOULD EXERT LEVERAGE OVER THE BOSNIAN CROATS TO STOP </p><p>LOOTING AND BURNING IN AREAS THAT ARE DUE TO BE RETURNED </p><p>TO THE BOSNIAN SERBS.  HE ADDED THAT TENSIONS IN BIH ARE </p><p>COMPLEX AND THAT ALTHOUGH ISOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS </p><p>CONTINUE, THE BOSNIAKS AND CROATS HAD SUCCEEDED IN </p><p>PREVENTING WIDER CONFLICT THROUGH THE FEDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) WHEN ASKED WHY THE U.S. SHOULD PARTICIPATE ON THE </p><p>GROUND AND NOT JUST PROVIDE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND AIR </p><p>POWER, TUDJMAN SAID THAT THE U.S. WAS THE LAST REMAINING </p><p>SUPERPOWER AND MUST BE THE FOUNDATION FOR A PEACEFUL </p><p>SOLUTION; THAT IS A ROLE THAT CANNOT BE ESCAPED. THE </p><p>TROUBLES OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA SHOULD BE A EUROPEAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  04931  02 OF 02  051623Z </p><p>ISSUE, BUT EUROPE HAD NO POLITICAL UNITY AND COULD NOT </p><p>DEAL WITH SUCH A COMPLEX ISSUE AS BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) CODEL MOLINARI DID NOT CLEAR THIS MESSAGE PRIOR </p><p>TO DEPARTURE FROM ZAGREB ON DECEMBER 3. </p><p> </p><p>15.
