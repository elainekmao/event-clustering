REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ON MARCH 13, THE SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM ISSUED A TOUGH </p><p>CRITIQUE OF THE ZIMBABWEAN ELECTION PROCESS, SAYING THE ELECTION </p><p>CAMPAIGN WAS MARRED BY INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE IN ALL PROVINCES OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY, PREDOMINANTLY AGAINST MDC SUPPORTERS.  THE SADC-PF </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT THE CLIMATE OF "INSECURITY" PREVAILING IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>SINCE THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS PREVENTED AN ASSESSMENT </p><p>THAT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS HAD COMPLIED WITH SADC\'S ELECTORAL NORMS </p><p>AND STANDARDS.  THE SOUTH AFRICAN OBSERVER MISSION, ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, DESCRIBED THE ELECTION OUTCOME AS A LEGITIMATE EXPRESSION OF </p><p>THE WILL OF THE ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE AND CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO ACCEPT THE RESULT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM\'S 70-MEMBER ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVATION MISSION ISSUED ON MARCH 13 A HARD-HITTING STATEMENT ON </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN ELECTORAL PROCESS (FAXED TO AF/S).  THEIR KEY </p><p>FINDINGS ARE LISTED BELOW: </p><p> </p><p>--THE ELECTION PERIOD WAS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH LEVELS OF </p><p>POLARIZATION AND POLITICAL INTOLERANCE, LACK OF COMMUNICATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00665  01 OF 02  131648Z </p><p>AGAINST STAKEHOLDERS AND LACK OF FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION TO THE </p><p>ELECTORATE, WHICH ARE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR DEMOCRACY TO </p><p>PREVAIL; </p><p> </p><p>--THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN WAS MARRED BY INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE IN ALL </p><p>PROVINCES OF THE COUNTRY, PERPETRATED PRIMARILY AGAINST MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS OR PERCEIVED OPPONENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT; </p><p> </p><p>--THERE WERE NUMEROUS CASES OF ALLEGED TORTURE, ARSON, ASSAULT, AND </p><p>INCIDENCES OF FALSE IMPRISONMENT, INCLUDING ABDUCTION OF MDC </p><p>POLLING AGENTS.  IN ONE SUCH INCIDENT, A SADC-PF OBSERVER TEAM </p><p>INTERVENED WHEN POLICE IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL DETAINED 24 MDC </p><p>ELECTION AGENTS WHO WERE ON THEIR WAY TO HARARE TO VOTE; </p><p> </p><p>--ACTS OF VIOLENCE APPEARED TO BE SYSTEMATICALLY EMPLOYED BY YOUTH </p><p>AND WAR VETERANS WITH CAMPS DOTTED AROUND THE COUNTRY; </p><p> </p><p>--THE USE OF RIOT SQUADS TO DISPERSE POTENTIAL VOTERS IN HARARE </p><p>RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE POLICE; </p><p> </p><p>--THE RULING PARTY\'S CAMPAIGN WAS RELATIVELY UNINTERRUPTED WHILE </p><p>SOME OPPOSITION PARTY MEETINGS WERE CANCELLED OR INTERRUPTED; </p><p> </p><p>--THE REDUCTION OF POLLING STATIONS IN URBAN AREAS HAD A MAJOR </p><p>IMPACT, RESULTING IN CONGESTION WITH SOME PEOPLE SPENDING MORE THAN </p><p>48 HOURS IN QUEUES BECAUSE OF THEIR SHEER DETERMINATION TO VOTE.  A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE ELECTORATE WAS UNABLE TO VOTE AS A RESULT </p><p>OF LOGISTICAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER IMPEDIMENTS; </p><p> </p><p>--FREE MOVEMENT OF PARTY AGENTS WITH BALLOT BOXES WAS COMPROMISED </p><p>BY INTIMIDATION AND REPORTED ABDUCTIONS IN SOME PROVINCES; </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00665  01 OF 02  131648Z </p><p> </p><p>--THERE WAS LACK OF ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC MEDIA BY POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>OTHER THAN THE RULING PARTY; </p><p> </p><p>--THE MISSION CONCLUDED THAT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS "COULD NOT BE </p><p>SAID TO ADEQUATELY COMPLY WITH THE NORMS AND STANDARDS FOR </p><p>ELECTIONS IN THE SADC REGION" AND URGED SADC HEADS OF STATE AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO URGENTLY ENGAGE THE LEADERSHIP OF ZIMBABWE TO </p><p>FACILITATE DIALOGUE AND RECONCILIATION. </p><p> </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN OBSERVER MISSION </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) SOUTH AFRICA\'S OBSERVER MISSION DELIVERED ON MARCH 13 A </p><p>DISAPPOINTING "INTERIM" STATEMENT ON THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  SPEAKING IN A ROOM OVERFLOWING WITH INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>LOCAL JOURNALISTS AND MEMBERS OF THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY, </p><p>DELEGATION LEADER SAM MOTSUENYANE SAID THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTORAL P </p><p>ROCESS </p><p>HAD BEEN THREATENED BY THE "REGULATORY FRAMEWORK," AND THAT THE PRESIDE </p><p>NTIAL CAMPAIGN HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY POLARIZATION, TENSION, VIOLENC </p><p>E AND INTIMIDATION.

HE DID NOT HAVE KIND </p><p>WORDS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA, WHICH HE SAID HAD BEEN </p><p>"OVERWHELMINGLY" BIASED IN FAVOR OF THE MDC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE STATEMENT SOFTENED CONSIDERABLY FROM THAT POINT. </p><p>MOTSUENYANE DESCRIBED AS "UNFORTUNATE" THE FACT THAT SOME VOTERS IN </p><p>HARARE AND CHITUNGWIZA HAD BEEN TURNED AWAY FROM POLLING STATIONS, </p><p>BUT HE ATTRIBUTED THIS TO "ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT," AN </p><p>EXPLANATION WHICH ELICITED GUFFAWS FROM THE ASSEMBLED CROWD. </p><p>MOTSUENYANE SAID HIS DELEGATION HAD BEEN HEARTENED BY THE MDC\'S </p><p>ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE CAMPAIGN AND BY THE "BIG" TURNOUT, </p><p>FACTORS WHICH HAD "LEGITIMIZED" THE PROCESS.  HE DESCRIBED THE </p><p>OUTCOME AS A LEGITIMATE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PEOPLE AND CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ACCEPT THEIR </p><p>VERDICT.  MOTSUENYANE\'S LISTENERS WERE CLEARLY DUMBFOUNDED AT HIS </p><p>PRONOUNCEMENT OF LEGITIMACY, AND LET OUT A COLLECTIVE GROAN. </p><p> </p><p>TENSE Q & A SESSION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE Q & A SESSION WHICH FOLLOWED BORDERED ON HOSTILE, AS </p><p>BOTH LOCAL AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS SUBJECTED MOTSUENYANE AND THE </p><p>ACCOMPANYING MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM TO RIGOROUS QUESTIONING, </p><p>SOMETIMES LAUGHING OUT LOUD AT THEIR RESPONSES.  AN AUSTRALIAN </p><p>JOURNALIST NOTED THAT A RANGE OF WELL-RESPECTED CIVIL SOCIETY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS HAD PROVIDED AMPLE DOCUMENTATION OF THE SERIOUSLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00665  02 OF 02  131648Z </p><p>FLAWED ELECTION PROCESS, ASKED WHETHER THE SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION </p><p>HAD MET WITH THEM AND, IF SO, HAD THOSE ORGANIZATIONS BEEN LYING OR </p><p>HALLUCINATING?  ONE QUESTIONER ASKED MOTSUENYANE TO ELABORATE ON </p><p>THE "ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHTS" THAT HAD PREVENTED VOTERS IN HARARE </p><p>AND CHITUNGWIZA FROM CASTING BALLOTS, WHILE ANOTHER INQUIRED </p><p>POINTEDLY WHETHER THE SOUTH AFRICAN STATEMENT SERVED THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PEOPLE WELL.  AN INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION REPORTER DECLARED THAT </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICAN MISSION APPEARED TO BE ENDORSING THE EXISTENCE OF </p><p>LOWER STANDARDS FOR DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA.  ASKED DIRECTLY WHO WAS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE VIOLENCE, MOTSUENYANE SIMPLY REFUSED TO </p><p>BE DRAWN ON THAT QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE SADC-PF ASSESSMENT WAS APPROPRIATELY CRITICAL AND </p><p>PROVIDED AMPLE DETAILS ON THE NUMEROUS FLAWS IN THE ELECTION </p><p>PROCESS, WHILE CAREFULLY AVOIDING CONFERRING ANY LEGITIMACY ON THE </p><p>OUTCOME.  THEY DID NOT PULL ANY PUNCHES AND STATED EXPLICITLY THAT </p><p>MDC SUPPORTERS WERE THE PREDOMINANT VICTIMS -- NOT THE PERPETRATORS </p><p>-- OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  WE EXPECT THE GOZ WILL IGNORE THE </p><p>INDICTMENT FROM REGIONAL PARLIAMENTARIANS AND, INSTEAD, FOCUS ON </p><p>THE "ENDORSEMENT" FROM THE SOUTH AFRICAN TEAM, WHOSE PERFORMANCE, </p><p>FRANKLY, WE FOUND EMBARRASSING.  MANY ZIMBABWEANS ARE PROFOUNDLY </p><p>DISAPPOINTED -- BUT NOT SURPRISED -- BY THE STATEMENT FROM THE </p><p>SOUTH AFRICANS, WHOM THEY HAD VIEWED AS THE ONLY REGIONAL COUNTRY </p><p>CAPABLE OF PROTECTING THEM FROM THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT.  A SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN CIVIC ACTIVIST WHO WORKS CLOSELY WITH AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>IN THE REGION TOLD ME AFTERWARD THAT HE WAS DEEPLY EMBARRASSED BY </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICAN TEAM\'S ASSESSMENT.  MOTSUENYANE EMPHASIZED </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES THAT HIS DELEGATION\'S REPORT WAS ONLY "INTERIM," BUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00665  02 OF 02  131648Z </p><p>HIS TEAM HAS ALREADY CONFERRED ON MUGABE PRECISELY WHAT HE WAS </p><p>COUNTING ON -- RECOGNITION BY SADC\'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>HEAVYWEIGHT OF THE LEGITIMACY OF HIS ELECTION VICTORY. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
