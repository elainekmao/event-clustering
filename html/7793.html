KINNEY </p><p>DHS FOR JOE O\'GORMAN AND LIZ TISDALE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR HSC-CHRIS HORNBARGER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ECON, PREF, CA, Transportation </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW U.S.- CANADA AVIATION PRECLEARANCE AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: OTTAWA 965 </p><p> </p><p>1.  The United States and Canada exchanged diplomatic notes </p><p>May 2, bringing into effect the Aviation Preclearance </p><p>Agreement that had been signed in 2001.  Ambassador Cellucci </p><p>exchanged notes with Foreign Minister Graham in a ceremony in </p><p>Canada\'s Parliament building.  Transportation Minister </p><p>Collenette also participated. </p><p> </p><p>2. The Ministers and the Ambassador made brief remarks. </p><p>Graham praised the Ambassador for his work to overcome </p><p>obstacles and bring the agreement into force.  He also noted </p><p>that the agreement took account of the Canadian Charter of </p><p>Rights and that it would allow for expansion of preclearance </p><p>services to other airports.  Collenette described the </p><p>advantages of in-transit preclearance, although he did not </p><p>actually use that term.   Ambassador Cellucci said that the </p><p>agreement helped to improve security for U.S. preclearance </p><p>personnel, and stressed that preclearance is a great </p><p>convenience that promotes tourism, business, and family ties </p><p>among Americans and Canadians. </p><p> </p><p>3. There was a substantial press contingent at the event. </p><p>The questions for the Ambassador and the Ministers, however, </p><p>focused on upcoming Canadian government decisions about the </p><p>decriminalization of marijuana and about participation in a </p><p>missile defense program. </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment: In recent conversations, Canadian officials have </p><p>emphasized that the major advantage to Canada from the new </p><p>agreement is the prospect of in-transit preclearance in </p><p>several Canadian airports.  However,  these officials have </p><p>said they are not aware of any plans by an airport to request </p><p>in-transit preclearance in the near term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
