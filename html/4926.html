The U.S. is preparing to transfer an </p><p>additional 50,000 troops to the Gulf region, papers report. </p><p>Reports claim that the Iraqi embassy in Ankara has presented </p><p>a note to MFA, protesting Prime Minister Gul\'s comments to </p><p>media representatives last week in which he referred to </p><p>Saddam Hussein as a `ruthless dictator.\'  The Iraqi embassy </p><p>and MFA have denied these reports.  Turkey\'s Foreign Trade </p><p>Minister Kursat Tuzmen is due to visit Baghdad with 150 </p><p>businessmen and MFA officials on January 10.  Tuzmen will </p><p>convey a letter from Gul to Saddam Hussein, and discuss </p><p>trade issues with the Iraqi Administration.  In a front page </p><p>commentary, "Milliyet" speculates that Ankara prefers a </p><p>`Swiss model\' for a post-Saddam Iraq, where Kurds, Arabs and </p><p>Turkomen would have their own cantons tied to a central </p><p>authority in Baghdad.  Ankara believes that this model could </p><p>prevent the disintegration of Iraq.  "Radikal" quotes a </p><p>`U.S. source\' saying that the U.S. was not against a `modus </p><p>operandi\' for site surveys on Turkish bases, but that </p><p>details of an agreement still needed to be worked out.  The </p><p>source said that the US expected a response from Ankara </p><p>regarding transfer of U.S. troops to Iraq via Turkey before </p><p>January 26, when the initial report by UN arms inspectors </p><p>will be unveiled.  Whether Turkey will ultimately decide on </p><p>full or limited support, the U.S. needs to know about </p><p>Ankara\'s decision in order to shape its own policy, the U.S. </p><p>source reportedly said.  Radikal believes that recent </p><p>developments and the latest NSC decision indicate that </p><p>Ankara will provide partial support to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>General Myers\' visit: Papers report that U.S. Chairman of </p><p>the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Richard Myers, will visit </p><p>Turkey on a regional tour of eight countries in January. </p><p>Gen. Myers will meet with Chief of Staff Gen. Ozkok, and </p><p>explore possibilities for using Turkish airbases and </p><p>harbors, according to reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan on Cyprus: AKP leader Erdogan said that Cyprus is </p><p>not Denktas\'s personal issue, and that the AKP government </p><p>would not stick to Turkey\'s traditional Cyprus policy. </p><p>Erdogan noted that while Denktas believes that the UN- </p><p>sponsored Cyprus plan is negotiable, he views the Greek </p><p>Cypriots as unreliable.  `We must put aside suspicions, and </p><p>begin negotiations for compromise,\' Erdogan noted.  The </p><p>recent protest demonstration against the status quo by </p><p>30,000 Turkish Cypriots indicates that northern Cyprus is </p><p>`heading somewhere,\' Erdogan said, and he warned of grave </p><p>difficulties if a solution is reached before February 28. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President approves constitutional changes: President Sezer </p><p>approved a package of constitutional reforms which pave the </p><p>way for Erdogan to run for parliament in the new election in </p><p>Siirt.  Sezer had earlier vetoed the amendment package on </p><p>the grounds that it was tailored particularly for Erdogan. </p><p>The High Election Board (YSK) announced on Wednesday that </p><p>the election in Siirt will be held on February 9. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Swiss Model for Iraq" </p><p>Fikret Bila wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (1/2): "Turkey </p><p>remains firmly opposed to a Kurdish state in Iraq.  Turkey </p><p>has given this warning as part of a strong message to the </p><p>US.  The message also included Ankara\'s concern about the </p><p>possibility that Iraq\'s oil-rich regions could fall under </p><p>the control of a particular ethnic group or the US.  Such a </p><p>scenario would be totally unacceptable for Turkey.  . Turkey </p><p>has been working on several scenarios for Iraq in the post- </p><p>operation era.  An Iraqi `federation\' is not Ankara\'s </p><p>immediate preference. Turkey\'s preference for Iraq is a </p><p>Swiss-style system based on cantons.  Turkey believes that a </p><p>cantonal structure would not only serve the interests of </p><p>Kurds and Turkomans, but also make them attached to a </p><p>central authority, which will prevent the dismemberment of </p><p>Iraq.  The plan is supported by the Turkish military as well </p><p>as the Foreign Ministry.  Ankara remains in close contact </p><p>with the US on the Iraq issue, and hopes that its views and </p><p>proposals for the future of Iraq will be taken into account </p><p>by Washington." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The reason for saying NO to war" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak (1/2): </p><p>"The drawing of borders in the Middle East and the regimes </p><p>that were put in place there all resulted from the demise of </p><p>the Ottoman Empire and decisions made by the Western powers. </p><p>The western powers defined and designed the status quo in </p><p>the region based on their interests.  Today they are once </p><p>again trying to redesign it based on their current needs and </p><p>interests.  Turkey has been the loser from the last </p><p>century\'s imperial plans.  And today once again the western </p><p>powers want Turkey to fall into this trap.  This is exactly </p><p>why the people of Turkey are loudly saying NO." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
