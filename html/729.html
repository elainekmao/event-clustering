<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 PRETORIA 005893 </p><p> </p><p>CAPE TOWN ALSO FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICE AND POL </p><p>LONDON FOR YOUNG, PARIS FOR MORAN/ROBL </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  5/10/2025 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, KPRP, SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTH AFRICA: THABO MBEKI, THE MAN WHO WOULD BE </p><p>PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  AFTER A YEAR IN OFFICE DEPUTY PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI\'S </p><p>IMAGE APPEARS A BIT TARNISHED, THE RESULT OF HIS </p><p>QUESTIONABLE HANDLING OF THE FIRING OF WINNIE MANDELA, </p><p>HIS HASTE TO CAST DOUBT ON ALLAN BOESAK\'S CULPABILITY ON </p><p>CORRUPTION CHARGES, HIS WAFFLING ON THE QUESTION OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MEDIATION AND HIS ATTACKS ON THE MEDIA. </p><p>THOUGH THE MAN WHO WOULD BE PRESIDENT REMAINS UNTOUCHED </p><p>BY PERSONAL SCANDAL AND IS UNCHALLENGED IN HIS SENIOR </p><p>PARTY AND GOVERNMENT POSITIONS, HIS PRINCIPAL WEAKNESS </p><p>SEEMS TO BE THAT HE CANNOT SEE THAT ASSOCIATION WITH </p><p>CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN BE DAMAGING TO HIM.  WHILE NELSON </p><p>MANDELA WOULD PROBABLY LIKE TO SEE MBEKI SUCCEED HIM AS </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE ANC AND SOUTH AFRICA, THE GIFT IS NOT </p><p>ENTIRELY HIS TO GIVE.  MBEKI STILL HAS THE HURDLE OF THE </p><p>ANC\'S 1997 NATIONAL CONFERENCE TO OVERCOME.  A LOT CAN </p><p>HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, AND WE HEAR REPORTS THAT </p><p>FORCES ALREADY ARE QUIETLY WORKING TO UNDERMINE HIM. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THE KINGMAKERS OF 1999 COULD BE THE </p><p>SEVEN ANC PROVINCIAL PREMIERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE RUNNER STUMBLES </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  MBEKI HAS GONE THROUGH A BAD PATCH OF PUBLICITY OF </p><p>LATE.  FIRST, INSTRUCTED BY THE PRESIDENT TO FIRE ONE OF </p><p>HIS KEY ALLIES IN THE ANC, WINNIE MANDELA, FROM THE </p><p>CABINET HE TRIED TO TALK HER INTO APOLOGIZING.   MRS. </p><p>MANDELA DID NOT, WRITING INSTEAD A BITTER LETTER THAT </p><p>AMOUNTED TO AN AD HOMINEM ATTACK ON HER ESTRANGED </p><p>HUSBAND.  FINALLY MANDELA FIRED HER HIMSELF, SKIPPING A </p><p>FEW CONSTITUTIONALLY STIPULATED STEPS, APPARENTLY HAVING </p><p>BEEN POORLY ADVISED.  MRS. MANDELA THREATENED TO SUE AND </p><p>WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT SHE HAD SOLID LEGAL GROUNDS, SHE </p><p>WAS REINSTATED, ONLY TO BE FIRED AGAIN.  IT WAS AN </p><p>EMBARRASSING EPISODE DURING WHICH MBEKI (NOT ENTIRELY </p><p>COINCIDENTALLY) MANAGED TO FIND HIMSELF OUT OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  THE WHITE PRESS CRITICIZED MBEKI AS INDECISIVE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  NEXT, MBEKI RUSHED TO CLAIM A REPORT PREPARED BY HIS </p><p>LEGAL ADVISOR, MOJANKU GUMBI, EXONERATED DISGRACED ANC </p><p>WESTERN CAPE LEADER ALLAN BOESAK OF CULPABILITY IN </p><p>CORRUPTION CHARGES.  A SENIOR ANC OFFICIAL TOLD US THAT </p><p>BOESAK, WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, VISITED </p><p>PRESIDENT MANDELA AT ANC HEADQUARTERS JUST PRIOR TO THE </p><p>RELEASE OF THE REPORT\'S FINDINGS TO PROCLAIM HIS </p><p>INNOCENCE.  BASED ON MBEKI\'S STATEMENT AND BOESAK\'S </p><p>DRAMATIC APPEAL, MANDELA PUBLICLY VOICED HIS CONFIDENCE </p><p>IN BOESAK, SAYING THE LATTER SHOULD RECEIVE ANOTHER </p><p>AMBASSADORSHIP.  BOESAK CROWED ABOUT HIS "REHABILITATION" </p><p>AND DECLARED HE WAS READY TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY\'S </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE INVESTIGATION BY THE </p><p>OFFICE OF SERIOUS ECONOMIC OFFENSES HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>CONCLUDED, THE PRESIDENT AND DEPUTY PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>STATEMENTS SMACKED OF A WHITEWASH, WHICH THE PRESS HERE </p><p>CRITICIZED MERCILESSLY.  GUMBI SUBSEQUENTLY CLARIFIED </p><p>THAT THE REPORT ONLY STATED THAT SHE HAD SEEN NO EVIDENCE </p><p>IMPLICATING BOESAK OF POCKETING FOREIGN DONOR FUNDS. </p><p>MANDELA BACKPEDALLED ON THE PROMISED APPOINTMENT, AND </p><p>MBEKI ALLEGEDLY TOLD BOESAK TO SHUN THE SPOTLIGHT WHILE </p><p>HE LOOKED FOR A JOB FOR HIM, POSSIBLY AT ANC </p><p>HEADQUARTERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ON MAY 5, A WELL-CONNECTED ANC LAWYER TOLD US GUMBI\'S </p><p>SHORT REPORT WAS MEANT ONLY AS AN UPDATE FOR INTERNAL </p><p>USE, NOT A FINAL, PUBLIC REPORT.  HE STRONGLY CRITICIZED </p><p>MBEKI FOR RELEASING THE REPORT, WHILE EXPRESSING </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN GUMBI. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MANDELA HAS ALSO GIVEN MBEKI THE LEAD IN LAYING OUT </p><p>THE ANC\'S EXPLANATIONS FOR FAILING TO ACT ON THE APRIL </p><p>1994 AGREEMENT WITH INKATHA AND THE NP TO SEEK </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MEDIATION OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES.  MBEKI WAS ALSO CHARGED WITH </p><p>NEGOTIATING THE ISSUE WITH THE IFP AND NP.  WHILE </p><p>PRIVATELY REASSURING TO INKATHA LEADER MANGOSUTHU </p><p>BUTHELEZI, IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON THE ISSUE MBEKI </p><p>HAS TAKEN A PARTICULARLY HARD LINE.  THE ANC HAS IN </p><p>CONSEQUENCE TAKEN A DRUBBING FROM ASSORTED PARTY </p><p>SPOKESPERSONS, JOURNALISTS, AND OTHER OBSERVERS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  FINALLY, ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS, MBEKI IN RECENT </p><p>WEEKS HAS BEEN WHIPPING UP ANTI-PRESS SENTIMENT BOTH IN </p><p>THE ANC\'S PARLIAMENTARY CAUCUS AND THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE (NEC).  HE BLAMED THE MEDIA FOR HIS RECENT </p><p>TROUBLES, POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESS WAS DICTATING ANC </p><p>DECISIONS, AND CULTIVATED A FEAR AMONG ANC ACTIVISTS THAT </p><p>A HOSTILE PRESS WILL KEEP ANTI-ANC NEWS IN THE HEADLINES </p><p>AS MOMENTUM BUILDS UP FOR THE NOVEMBER LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>ELECTIONS.  ONE INFLUENTIAL NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT </p><p>MBEKI\'S SUSPICION OF THE MEDIA LED HIM TO CALL FOR RADIO </p><p>AND TELEVISION TIME SLOTS FOR GOVERNMENT BROADCASTS. </p><p>SOME OBSERVERS HERE INTERPRET MBEKI\'S INTOLERANCE OF </p><p>CRITICISM AS A RESIDUAL CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS DAYS IN </p><p>EXILE, WHEN THE LIBERATION MOVEMENT BROOKED NO DISSENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>WHEELER DEALER </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  WHILE MBEKI MAY HAVE BEEN SCORED BY THE PRESS, HIS </p><p>POSITION WITHIN THE ANC AND GOVERNMENT IS SECURE.  SELF- </p><p>ASSURED, ARTICULATE AND CHARISMATIC, HE REMAINS ONE OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S SHREWDEST POLITICIANS.  HE HAS PLACED HIS </p><p>ALLIES IN KEY GOVERNMENT PORTFOLIOS, AND CONTINUES TO </p><p>BUILD UP AND CALL IN FAVORS.  NOT STRAITJACKETED BY </p><p>IDEOLOGY, MBEKI IS IN THE SAME PRAGMATIC CAMP AS CYRIL </p><p>RAMAPHOSA.  IF HE HAS A WEAKNESS IT IS AN INABILITY TO </p><p>FORESEE THE HARM THAT ASSOCIATION WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN </p><p>CAUSE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SINCE HIS REELECTION AS ANC SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE </p><p>DEATH OF KEY SUPPORTER JOE SLOVO, CYRIL RAMAPHOSA\'S </p><p>RIVALRY WITH MBEKI HAS SUBSIDED.  MBEKI LIEUTENANTS </p><p>APPEAR CONCERNED THAT DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL CHERYL </p><p>CAROLUS IS A BECOMING A MAGNET FOR MBEKI\'S ADVERSARIES. </p><p>ANC INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR YUSUF SALOOJEE TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE EMPLOYEES IN HIS OFFICE WERE BYPASSED FOR A </p><p>RAISE GRANTED TO ALL ANC HEADQUARTERS EMPLOYEES IN 1994. </p><p>INFORMED OF THE DISPARITY, PRESIDENT MANDELA INSTRUCTED </p><p>CAROLUS, WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE ANC\'S DAY-TO-DAY </p><p>OPERATIONS, BEFORE THE NATIONAL WORKING COMMITTE IN APRIL </p><p>1995 TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION IMMEDIATELY.  SALOOJEE </p><p>HIMSELF COLLECTED 68,000 RANDS (APPROXIMATELY USD 18,900) </p><p>IN BACK PAY.  SALOOJEE ALSO TOLD US THAT CAROLUS, WHO IS </p><p>CLOSE TO KEY MBEKI RIVAL MAC MAHARAJ, FAILS TO INFORM HIS </p><p>DEPARTMENT, WHICH ACTS AS MBEKI\'S EYES AND EARS AT </p><p>HEADQUARTERS, OF IMPORTANT MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  IN HIS GOVERNMENT OFFICES, ONE IS GREETED BY THE </p><p>SIGHT OF MINISTERS AND PARTY OFFICIALS WAITING FOR MBEKI </p><p>TO RECEIVE THEM AND TO TAKE ACTION ON A HOST OF PERSONAL </p><p>AND POLITICAL MATTERS.  DUE TO POOR STAFFING AND HIS </p><p>PUNISHING TRAVEL SCHEDULE, MUCH BUSINESS FALLS THROUGH </p><p>THE CRACKS.  MBEKI HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR MISSING </p><p>APPOINTMENTS, AND DOCUMENTS LIE IN HIS IN-BASKET FOR </p><p>WEEKS.  HE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY UNABLE TO DELEGATE </p><p>DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY, AND EXHAUSTS HIMSELF BY </p><p>BECOMING EXCESSIVELY INVOLVED IN THE MOST MINUTE DETAILS </p><p>ON A RANGE OF ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  AFTER A YEAR IN HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICE MBEKI REMAINS </p><p>PERSONALLY UNTAINTED BY SCANDAL.  MBEKI HAS ALWAYS LIVED </p><p>COMFORTABLY, THANKS LARGELY TO HIS WIFE\'S INCOME AS A </p><p>UNITED NATIONS EMPLOYEE AND BANK OFFICIAL, BUT NEVER </p><p>SUMPTUOUSLY.  A RESPECTED FEMALE JOURNALIST AND </p><p>LONGSTANDING EMBASSY CONTACT CONFIDED TO US THAT SHE </p><p>AVOIDS ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS WITH MBEKI BECAUSE HE HAS MADE </p><p>SEXUAL ADVANCES TOWARD HER.  HOWEVER, SUCH STORIES ARE </p><p>RELATIVELY RARE, AND MBEKI HAS NOT GAINED THE REPUTATION </p><p>OF A "WOMANIZER". </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MANDELA\'S SUCCESSOR? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  MBEKI\'S MOST IMPORTANT ASSET IS THE TRUST AND </p><p>AFFECTION OF NELSON MANDELA.  MANDELA HAS MADE HIM THE </p><p>MR. FIX-IT OF THE GOVERNMENT AND HANDED HIM INCREASING </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY ADMINISTRATION OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  IF MANDELA COULD, HE WOULD INSTALL HIS HAND- </p><p>PICKED CHOICE FOR SUCCESSOR IN THE PRESIDENCY OF BOTH </p><p>PARTY AND COUNTRY IN 1997 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE GIFT IS NOT ENTIRELY MANDELA\'S TO GIVE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  MBEKI STILL HAS THE 1997 ANC NATIONAL CONFERENCE TO </p><p>SURVIVE BEFORE HE CAN CLAIM THE MANTLE OF LEADERSHIP.  AT </p><p>THIS WRITING IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT HOW POLITICAL </p><p>FORCES WITHIN THE PARTY WILL BE RANGED AT THAT TIME.  WE </p><p>FIND IT PLAUSIBLE THAT ANC PROVINCIAL PREMIERS COULD </p><p>BEGIN BUILDING POWER BASES AND MACHINES IN THEIR </p><p>PROVINCES.  ASSUMING THAT NONE OF THESE SATRAPS-IN-THE- </p><p>MAKING CHOOSES OPENLY TO CHALLENGE MBEKI FOR THE ANC </p><p>LEADERSHIP, THEY COULD VERY WELL BECOME KINGMAKERS, WHOM </p><p>MBEKI WILL HAVE TO COURT ASSIDUOUSLY.  INDEED, MBEKI </p><p>SPENDS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME VISITING THE </p><p>PROVINCES AND HANDLING ANC PROBLEMS THERE IN RECOGNITION </p><p>OF THIS FACT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  MBEKI\'S PERFORMANCE AFTER A YEAR IN OFFICE HAS </p><p>SPARKED SOME REVISIONIST THINKING ABOUT THE MAN.  WHILE </p><p>STILL RESPECTED FOR HIS FORMIDABLE INTELLECT AND </p><p>POLITICAL INFIGHTING SKILLS, WE GET THE SENSE THAT SOME </p><p>PEOPLE HERE ARE BEGINNING TO QUESTION MORE OPENLY WHAT </p><p>MBEKI STANDS FOR.  MANDELA IS LETTING MUCH OF THE BUCK </p><p>STOP AT HIS DEPUTY\'S DESK, AND PROBLEMS AT THAT LEVEL </p><p>HAVE PROVEN IMPERVIOUS EITHER TO HIS DISARMING CHARM OR </p><p>THE TACTICS HE HAS SO OFTEN USED TO DEMOLISH RIVALS.  HIS </p><p>OFFICE IS WOEFULLY STAFFED AND NOT ORGANIZED FOR HANDLING </p><p>THIS TYPE OF RESPONSIBILITY (MANDELA\'S IS NOT BETTER), </p><p>WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR SOME OF THE MISSTEPS OF RECENT MONTHS. </p><p>SO FAR HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO RIDE THE TIGER, BUT IN THE </p><p>RUNNING FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENCY MBEKI WILL BE, IN THE </p><p>WORDS OF A RESPECTED JOURNALIST HERE, A FASCINATING </p><p>CHARACTER TO WATCH.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LYMAN </p><p></p></div>
