<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003815 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDA FOR FAS FOR EC AND CCC/FSA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EINV, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY ECONOMIC UPDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3693 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The increasing likelihood of a delay </p><p>beyond end-June in the Fifth Review under Turkey\'s IMF </p><p>program so far has not dampened the relatively buoyant mood </p><p>in the markets, as the lira continues to trade strongly </p><p>against the dollar.  The Central Bank intervened again this </p><p>week, to the tune of $550 million, while also issuing a </p><p>public statement warning that inflationary pressures persist. </p><p> That said, the Bank\'s latest survey shows a decline in </p><p>inflationary expectations coupled with improved expectations </p><p>for growth.   Amid anecdotal evidence of a pick-up in demand, </p><p>the latest figures for industrial production indicate </p><p>continued, albeit modest, growth.  The Treasury this week </p><p>successfully placed $760 million in Euro-denominated bonds, </p><p>while raising another $1.2 billion via the sale of </p><p>lira-denominated t-bills.  The government launched tenders </p><p>for two key privatizations -- involving oil refiner Tupras </p><p>and spirits/cigarette producer Tekel -- but is hinting it </p><p>might not bless the results of the just-concluded tender for </p><p>the privatization of petrochemical company Petkim.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The GOT continues to move slowly on meeting the </p><p>conditions for the Fifth Review under its IMF-supported </p><p>economic program.  Parliamentary Budget Committee Chairman </p><p>Sait Acba told us June 9 that Parliament was still debating a </p><p>proposal to put key pending legislation, including on </p><p>strengthening social security institutions, on to the Turkish </p><p>equivalent of "fast-track."  Treasury officials advised June </p><p>12 that they hope Parliament will vote on this procedural </p><p>question on June 19, with the vote on passing the legislation </p><p>itself coming sometime later.  IMF ResRep told us there has </p><p>been little progress on the fiscal side.  On the one hand, </p><p>the government keeps coming up with new, populist spending </p><p>ideas that would increase the fiscal gap, including a 50 </p><p>percent cut in electricity prices for exporters, a reduction </p><p>in the special consumption tax on cars, and a possible </p><p>reduction in the VAT on certin foods.  On the other hand, at </p><p>the political level, it has so far been unwilling to approve </p><p>serious measures to reduce the gap.  Per ResRep, Minister </p><p>Babacan and Treasury U/S Canakci presented the bureaucracy\'s </p><p>proposed fiscal measures to Prime Minister Erdogan on June 8; </p><p>he apparently was unenthusiastic, particularly about raising </p><p>electricity prices.  Instead, the government is coming up </p><p>with measures -- such as extending the partial spending </p><p>freeze and offering a "discount" to those signed up for the </p><p>tax amnesty proposal if they pay all their arrears up front </p><p>-- that would bring short-term fiscal benefits but would not </p><p>address the fundamental problem.  With Babacan heading off to </p><p>Malaysia and Pakistan today (with the Prime Minister) for </p><p>five days (after which the Minister will go to London and </p><p>Jordan), IMF ResRep does not expect rapid closure on the LOI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Markets so far have not reacted significantly to </p><p>the increasing prospects of a delay, although t-bill yields </p><p>have leveled off at the 48-49 percent range.  Treasury this </p><p>week successfully placed $760 million in Euro-denominated </p><p>bonds (yielding 9.7 percent), while raising another $1.2 </p><p>billion via the sale of 13-month lira-denominated bills with </p><p>a 48.4 percent yield.  The lira\'s continuing strength </p><p>prompted the Central Bank to intervene again on June 9, </p><p>buying some $550 million.  The intervention pushed the lira </p><p>back from a high of TL 1.409 million/dollar to TL 1.445 </p><p>million/dollar, but it quickly strengthened again and was </p><p>trading this morning at TL 1.423 million/dollar.  Monetary </p><p>Policy Council member Professor Guven Sak told us June 11 </p><p>that officials remain puzzled at the lira\'s strength, but </p><p>believe it is mostly the result of reverse currency </p><p>substitution by local residents.  Other Central Bank </p><p>officials have told us that, while the main reason for the </p><p>CB\'s intervention was to temper excessive volatility, the </p><p>Bank also saw an opportunity to build its dollar reserves </p><p>while ensuring sufficient lira liquidity in the market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Also on June 9, the Central Bank issued a </p><p>statement warning of continuing inflationary pressures:  "The </p><p>increase in May of public-sector prices and signals that </p><p>domestic demand is increasing are seen as risk elements that </p><p>could limit inflation\'s fall."  Analysts read the statement </p><p>as indicating the Bank would not further reduce short-term </p><p>interest rates anytime soon, despite the lira\'s strength. The </p><p>next day, however, the Bank announced that its latest survey </p><p>indicated that expectations for year-end inflation had fallen </p><p>from 26 to 25.6 percent, against a CPI target of 20 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The survey also revealed that expectations for 2003 </p><p>GNP growth had risen from 4.1 to 4.4 percent.  This fits with </p><p>anecdotal information we have been hearing from business </p><p>contacts, who detect a small pick-up in domestic demand. </p><p>April industrial production figures, up 4.2 percent over </p><p>April 2002, lend further support to this view.  The press </p><p>attributes much of the growth to booming exports -- up 30.6 </p><p>percent through the first four months of the year -- but </p><p>economists point out that imports are rising even faster (up </p><p>32.3 percent), so in fact foreign trade is not spurring </p><p>growth. Exports are, however, boosting confidence, at least </p><p>in some sectors (the auto sector\'s exports rose nearly 50 </p><p>percent through April). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Unfortunately for Turkey, the sharp rise in foreign </p><p>trade has not been matched by an increase in foreign direct </p><p>investment, which is -- at best -- trickling in.  Turkish </p><p>Treasury officials have been hoping that implementation of </p><p>long-delayed privatization plans might boost FDI (as well as </p><p>provide them with much-needed revenue), and the government </p><p>finally is beginning to move on this front.  The </p><p>Privatization Administration announced that it had received a </p><p>best bid of $605 million for a controlling stake in </p><p>petrochemicals firm Petkim.  Shortly thereafter, it launched </p><p>tenders for oil refining monopoloy Tupras and tobacco/spirts </p><p>giant Tekel.  The latter, in particular, is expected to </p><p>attract substantial foreign interest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The Petkim tender has sparked controversy.  First, </p><p>Prime Minister Erdogan, opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal, </p><p>and a host of others have complained that the $605 million </p><p>leading bid was far below Petkim\'s "market" value, and have </p><p>questioned whether the State should carry out the sale.  The </p><p>Prime Minister warned that the Higher Privatization Council, </p><p>which must give final approval to the sale, would look into </p><p>this question.  The other controversial aspect was that the </p><p>winning bid was made by Standart Kimya, owned by the Uzan </p><p>family of Motorola (and Genc Party) fame.  (Comment:  Unless </p><p>there is evidence of monkey business in the bidding process, </p><p>concerns about the size of the highest bid are unwarranted, </p><p>given that the priority here is to get these companies into </p><p>the private sector.  However, given the Uzan\'s track record, </p><p>there is reason to be concerned about the family taking </p><p>control of another major enterprise.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
