<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 003435 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR G/TIP, INL, WHA/PPC, WHA/CEN, PRM, AND DRL </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR EGAT/WID </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OPDAT </p><p>PANAMA FOR CUSTOMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, SMIG, PREL, ELAB, EAID, KPAO, KWMN, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (TIP) PROJECT </p><p>PROPOSALS FOR HONDURAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 224985 </p><p> </p><p>1. Post welcomes the opportunity to submit anti-Trafficking </p><p>in Persons (TIP) project proposals.  After discussing reftel </p><p>among the Political, Public Affairs, and Consular Sections, </p><p>as well as INS and USAID, Post proposes two Honduras-specific </p><p>program recommendations.  Embassy is also collaborating with </p><p>other regional embassies on a regional project to </p><p>survey/measure the extent of TIP in Central America, to be </p><p>submitted separately.  Post also strongly supports a proposal </p><p>previously submitted by the Department of Justice\'s Criminal </p><p>Division\'s Office of Prosecutorial Development, Assistance, </p><p>and Training (OPDAT) for anti-TIP training to Central </p><p>American prosecutors and police.  Post believes that it is </p><p>essential that any regional anti-TIP programs be coordinated </p><p>with the DOL-funded International Labor Organization\'s </p><p>International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor </p><p>(ILO-IPEC) project "Contribution to the Prevention and </p><p>Elimination of Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in </p><p>Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic," a </p><p>three-year, approximately USD 3.8 million, project that began </p><p>June 30, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>2. </p><p> </p><p>Project I </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>A.PROJECT:  Public Awareness Campaign Regarding Severe Forms </p><p>of Trafficking in Persons (TIP) </p><p>B.ORGANIZATION: A variety of GOH agencies, NGOs, and </p><p>international organizations, such as the Office of the First </p><p>Lady, National Women\'s Institute, Institute of the Child and </p><p>the Family (IHNFA), Ministry of Labor, Public Ministry, </p><p>Immigration, Casa Alianza, Human Rights Commission, IOM, </p><p>UNDP, and UNICEF. </p><p>C.DURATION: 2 years </p><p>D.OBJECTIVE: (1) To focus Honduran audiences on the existence </p><p>of TIP, especially those affecting women and children; (2) to </p><p>organize a forum of GOH agencies, NGOs, and international </p><p>organizations (listed above) to address the problem of TIP </p><p>and seek public policies to combat it.  This forum would </p><p>build on the already exisiting commission to combat </p><p>commercial child sexual exploitation that includes many of </p><p>the same organizations. </p><p>E.JUSTIFICATION: Honduran authorities and the general public </p><p>need to focus attention on the problem of TIP, especially </p><p>those involving women and children.  Many human rights </p><p>organizations have not included TIP as a top priority in </p><p>their organization\'s agenda.  The media has reported </p><p>incidences of TIP, but there has been no public service </p><p>campaign against TIP.  With a per capita GDP of USD 920 and </p><p>approximately half the population of Honduras under age 16, </p><p>poverty and unemployment exacerbate the number of potential </p><p>TIP victims. </p><p>F.PERFORMANCE MEASURES: Radio and TV campaigns; audience </p><p>levels can be determined.  Number of hot line calls to </p><p>prevention center can be tallied.  Statistics on number of </p><p>victims assisted and/or criminals prosecuted. </p><p>G.BUDGET BREAKOUT: 100,000 USD/year to develop and place </p><p>radio and TV public service announcements (PSAs) involving </p><p>sports and cultural figures and for sponsoring a forum in </p><p>Honduras of interested parties.  Recent studies in Honduras </p><p>have found that the frequency of PSAs is the key to having an </p><p>impact on society.  Unfortunately, Honduran radio and TV </p><p>stations do not run PSAs free of charge.  Seed money </p><p>(approximately USD 10,000 of the USD 100,000 total budget) to </p><p>launch a national forum on TIP. </p><p>H.GOH CONTRIBUTION? In-kind support. </p><p>I.OTHER DONOR COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTING? none </p><p>J.PROPOSED FUNDING MECHANISM: Public Affairs Section grants </p><p>to the co-sponsoring institutions. </p><p>K.EMBASSY POINT OF CONTACT: Derrick Olsen, Deputy Political </p><p>Chief/Labor Attache, (504) 236-9320, ext. 4394, and Melissa </p><p>Cooper, Public Affairs Officer, (504) 236-9320 ext. 4139. </p><p> </p><p>Project II </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>A.PROJECT: Assistance to Victims of Trafficking </p><p>B.ORGANIZATION: Governmental agencies Honduran Institute of </p><p>the Child and the Family (IHNFA) or National Women\'s </p><p>Institute, NGO Women\'s Studies Center (CEM-H), or UNICEF. </p><p>C.DURATION: 2 years </p><p>D.OBJECTIVE: Assist victims of trafficking, primarily women </p><p>and children, to reinsert themselves into productive society, </p><p>by providing counseling, education, and social support. </p><p>E.JUSTIFICATION: Victims of trafficking may be reticent to </p><p>become active members of society because of the stigma of </p><p>their exploitation.  Victims often lack life skills and have </p><p>substance abuse problems, thus making reinsertion difficult. </p><p>F.PERFORMANCE MEASURES: Number of victims served. </p><p>G.BUDGET BREAKOUT: 50,000 USD/year to establish a counseling </p><p>center, have NGO train IHNFA staff, provide training to </p><p>clients. </p><p>H.GOH CONTRIBUTION: In-kind contributions from IHNFA or </p><p>National Women\'s Institute. </p><p>I.OTHER DONOR COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTING? none </p><p>J.PROPOSED FUNDING MECHANISM: Public Affairs Section grants </p><p>to IHNFA or National Women\'s Institute. </p><p>K.EMBASSY POINT OF CONTACT: Derrick Olsen, Deputy Political </p><p>Chief/Labor Attache, (504) 236-9320, ext. 4394. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
