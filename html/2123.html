THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED A NOTE VERBALE </p><p>OCTOBER 26 TO ALL ACCREDITED MISSIONS OUTLINING THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S STANDARD POSITION AHEAD OF THE WTO DOHA MINISTERIAL </p><p>THAT DEVELOPED NATIONS SHOULD BE MORE OPEN TO IMPORTS FROM </p><p>THE DEVELOPING WORLD, WHILE WARNING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES </p><p>AGAINST FOLLOWING A "CRUDE PROTECTIONIST PATH." THE NOTE </p><p>ALSO INCLUDED A COPY OF ITS JULY 2001 TRIPS COUNCIL NON- </p><p>PAPER ENTITLED "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ACCESS TO BASIC </p><p>MEDICINES" WHICH PROPOSED GREATER ACCESS TO PHARMACEUTICALS </p><p>IN THE POOREST COUNTRIES. THIS RELEASE FOLLOWED AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>MEETING (REFTEL) IN WHICH POST AND U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL </p><p>INDUSTRY REPS PRESSED VATICAN CONTACTS FOR GREATER </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED FOR IPR PROTECTION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>FAIR TRADE FOR ALL </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.   THE VATICAN\'S PRE-DOHA DOCUMENT, ENTITLED "DEVELOPMENT </p><p>DIMENSIONS OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION," CALLED FOR </p><p>"GESTURES OF FLEXIBILITY AND SOLIDARITY" AS A STEP TOWARDS A </p><p>MORE INCLUSIVE VISION OF WORLD TRADE. THE VATICAN SEES "THE </p><p>ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT OF POORER COUNTRIES" AS A PLUS FOR </p><p>GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05650  01 OF 02  311416Z </p><p>SECURITY. THE VATICAN BELIEVES THE LEAST DEVELOPED NATIONS </p><p>HAVE ONLY "A MARGINAL AND DIMINISHING SHARE" IN WORLD TRADE. </p><p>FAIR TRADE RELATIONS, ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN, ARE AN </p><p>ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF ECONOMIC AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THE </p><p>VATICAN WARNS THAT ECONOMICS AND TRADE MUST BE PURSUED </p><p>WITHIN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, THE </p><p>PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ELIMINATION OF POVERTY. </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE VATICAN CALLS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF "TRADE AND </p><p>PRODUCTION DISTORTING EXPORT SUBSIDIES." IT SEEKS MARKET </p><p>ACCESS FOR PRODUCTS IN WHICH THE POOREST COUNTRIES HAVE </p><p>COMPARABLE ADVANTAGE. HOWEVER, THE VATICAN WARNED DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES AGAINST FOLLOWING A "CRUDE PROTECTIONIST PATH," </p><p>INSTEAD THESE COUNTRIES SHOULD FOLLOW A "SOLID AND VIABLE </p><p>PATH TO FREE TRADE THAT PERMITS THEM TO ENTER INTO AN </p><p>EQUITABLE DIALOGUE WITH INTERNATIONAL MARKETS." THE ECONOMIC </p><p>AND NEGOTIATING POWER DISADVANTAGES OF LESS INDUSTRIALIZED </p><p>ECONOMIES AND COMMODITY PRODUCER ECONOMIES CAN BE OVERCOME </p><p>BY FULLY IMPLEMENTING THE EXISTING WTO SPECIAL AND </p><p>DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT PRINCIPLE. THE VATICAN URGES THAT </p><p>DEVELOPING NATIONS RECEIVE TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO MEET EXISTING WTO OBLIGATIONS. ASSISTANCE IS </p><p>ALSO ASKED TO BROADEN AND DIVERSITY THEIR PRODUCTION AND </p><p>EXPORT BASE AND TRADE PROMOTION EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   THE VATICAN LAMENTS THE FACT THAT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES </p><p>ARE FORCED TO DIVERT VITAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENTING NEW </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DUTIES, ESPECIALLY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY </p><p>PROTECTION. THE VATICAN CALLS FOR A REVIEW OF TRIPS TO </p><p>BALANCE THE INTERESTS OF DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY WHEN "THE LIFE OF PEOPLE COULD BE A STAKE." THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05650  01 OF 02  311416Z </p><p>VATICAN ASKS THAT NO TRADE INTEREST HINDER THE MOST </p><p>ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE. </p><p> </p><p>5.   THE VATICAN URGES GREATER TRANSPARENCY FOR THE WTO IN </p><p>ALL ASPECTS OF DECISION MAKING. DEVELOPING NATIONS NEED TO </p><p>"OWN" THE DECISIONS THAT IMPACT DIRECTLY ON THEIR ECONOMIES </p><p>AND THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL MARKET. THE VATICAN </p><p>ASKS THAT THE NEGOTIATING AND REPRESENTATIONAL DIFFICULTIES </p><p>OF THESE NATIONS BE CONTINUALLY ADDRESSED. IT ALSO WARNED </p><p>THAT THE WTO COULD NOT RESOLVE ALL THE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>CHALLENGES OF TODAY\'S WORLD AND SUGGESTED THAT ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>OVER-STRETCH ITS MANDATE SHOULD BE RESISTED. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>SOCIAL MORTGAGE ON PHARMACEUTICAL PROFITS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.   THE TRIPS NON-PAPER SUGGESTS ACCESSIBLE PRICE IS A </p><p>DETERMINANT FACTOR IN ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND THAT </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL FACTORS MUST BE BALANCED AGAINST HIGH </p><p>PRICING TO ATTRACT INVESTORS AND MAINTAIN RESEARCH AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT. THE VATICAN URGES AN "INNOVATIVE PRICING </p><p>SYSTEM" TO PRESERVE R AND D INCENTIVES, SUGGESTING LUXURY </p><p>AND NON-ESSENTIAL PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS (COSMETICS) SHARE </p><p>A GREATER BURDEN FOR R AND D OF ESSENTIAL MEDICINES. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN, "A BROAD-BASED COMMITMENT OF </p><p>SOLIDARITY IS THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT POOR COUNTRIES FROM </p><p>FALLING INTO THE TEMPTATION OF WEAKENING THE INTELLECTUAL </p><p>PROPERTY RIGHTS FRAMEWORK." </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        VATICA  05650  01 OF 02  311416Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9922 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05650  02 OF 02  311416Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   AIT-03   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   JUSE-00  LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  CAEX-01  PA-00    PC-01    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /017W </p><p>                  ------------------37F5E1  311420Z /38 </p><p>R 311355Z OCT 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0000 </p><p>INFO WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 005650 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

THE VATICAN RECOGNIZES THAT THE COUNCIL FOR TRIPS </p><p>CANNOT RESOLVE THE ACCESSIBILITY TO BASIC MEDICINES PROBLEM. </p><p>IT URGES THE COUNCIL TO MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL CONTRIBUTION THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF TRIPS RULES THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH A </p><p>UNIFIED VISION OF LAW, BASED ON RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>AND APPLYING THOSE ARTICLES OF THE WTO TREATY THAT CALL FOR </p><p>A PRO-DEVELOPMENT INTERPRETATION OF THE WHOLE LEGAL BODY. </p><p>THE VATICAN SUGGESTS "THIS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A BROAD AND </p><p>NOT RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES 30 AND 31, WHICH </p><p>WOULD ALLOW THAT LICENSING FEES MAY BE FIXED IN ACCORDANCE </p><p>WITH THE REAL PURCHASING CAPACITY OF THE POOREST COUNTRY, </p><p>BALANCED WITH A SYSTEM THAT BLOCKS THE RE-EXPORT OF THE </p><p>LICENSED PRODUCTS TO THE ORIGINAL MARKETS." </p><p> </p><p>8.   COMMENT: IN NONE OF THIS DOES THE VATICAN APPEAR TO </p><p>REFLECT AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PURELY COMMERCIAL INTEREST </p><p>OF THOSE "DEVELOPING" COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY (EG. INDIA, BRAZIL). WE WILL FOLLOW </p><p>UP ON THIS THEME WITH THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR HEALTH CARE </p><p>ISSUES. POST HAS FAXED COPIES OF THE VATICAN DOCUMENTS TO </p><p>EUR/WE. END COMMENT.
