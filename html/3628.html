<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 002564 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY, PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KWMN, PREL, KCRM, ELAB, SMIG, ASEC, KFRD, KPAO </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PAN-SAHEL INITIATIVE (PSI) PLAN OF ACTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 156285 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF) Embassy strongly believes that inviting Nigeria to </p><p>participate in the Pan-Sahel Initiative (PSI) conference is </p><p>vital to the success of the PSI.  By reason of Nigeria\'s </p><p>political and economic importance, size, demographics and the </p><p>region\'s porous borders and well-worn overland routes, </p><p>Nigeria should attend this meeting and should be asked to </p><p>support the Initiative.  Moreover, if Nigeria is not invited, </p><p>it may view the Initiative as threatening and exclusionary. </p><p>Some of the other nations might find Nigeria\'s exclusion odd </p><p>as well. Out of distrust and misunderstanding, Nigeria could </p><p>react by undermining the Initiative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) As noted, Nigeria has agreements with several of </p><p>the participants on the same issues. Trans-border movement of </p><p>criminals has been a problem in Nigeria for many years. </p><p>Reports that Nigerien mutineers might have fled to Nigeria </p><p>demonstrate that Nigeria should be included in this effort. </p><p>Nigeria, Niger and Chad operate a joint task force to combat </p><p>insurgency and criminality in the Lake Chad Basin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) With heightened cognizance of potential terrorist </p><p>threats, the GON is aware of the dangers of outsiders </p><p>fomenting unrest in the already volatile Nigerian </p><p>environment. Within West Africa, Nigeria is clearly the </p><p>largest, most important player on security issues and, owing </p><p>to its huge urban centers and diverse populations, perhaps </p><p>the most susceptible to terrorist infiltration.  With Kano </p><p>and Maiduguri serving as major hubs on principal traditional </p><p>trans-Saharan trade routes, large transient and foreign-born </p><p>populations in those and other cities provide ideal places </p><p>for terrorists to bide their time or go to ground if faced </p><p>with pressure across the border.  Finally, Nigeria has a </p><p>solid history of backing USG counter-terror efforts.  For </p><p>example, when other countries refused to bite the bullet and </p><p>interdict Egyptair hijacker Mohammed Ali Rezaq in the early </p><p>90s, it was Nigeria that removed him during a Lagos transit </p><p>enroute to Sudan and turned him over to the FBI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) An additional reason to invite Nigeria is its </p><p>participation in a permanent joint task force (with Niger and </p><p>Chad) operating against brigands in the Lake Chad area. </p><p>Involving the GON at the inception prevents the kind of </p><p>resentment we experienced with the Nigerians on ACRI.  The </p><p>potential pitfall with inviting Nigeria to the conference is </p><p>that there seems to be no immediate plans to provide any </p><p>resources to Nigeria.  When the Nigerians discover that other </p><p>countries are receiving assistance they will seek equal </p><p>treatment and we must be prepared to respond to their likely </p><p>assistance on requests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) In short, without Nigeria a big piece of the PSI </p><p>equation is missing.  While impossible to predict the level </p><p>of GON engagement over time, Nigeria\'s past engagement </p><p>suggests a strong positive role in the months and years </p><p>ahead.  Bringing Nigeria into the planning stages of the PSI </p><p>would help ensure its tacit, and possibly active, support -- </p><p>even in the absence of any immediate prospect of USG material </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) We believe that key GON officials to invite might </p><p>include Director of State Security, LTC L.K.K. Are (retired); </p><p>National Security Adviser LTG Aliyu Mohammed (retired); MFA </p><p>Under Secretary for Africa Ambassador Femi </p><p>George; and Defence Minister Danjuma and/or Minister of State </p><p>for Defence (Army) Lawal Batagarawa. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
