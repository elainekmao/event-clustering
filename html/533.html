<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KHARTOUM 05809 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.:12356:DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PINS, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  BASHIR RELEASES COUP PLOTTERS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  91 KHARTOUM 1520 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ON JULY 27, SUDANESE HEAD OF </p><p>STATE LT. GEN. OMAR BASHIR REPORTEDLY PARDONED THOSE </p><p>PERSONS WHO HAVE RECEIVED PRISON SENTENCES OF </p><p>FIFTEEN YEARS OR LESS FOR STATE SECURITY CRIMES.  HE </p><p>ALSO REDUCED PRISON TERMS FOR OTHERS AND PROMISED </p><p>OBSERVANCE OF LEGAL RIGHTS IN FUTURE SECURITY </p><p>CASES.  WHILE THE MOVE TO RELEASE PRISONERS IS A </p><p>POSITIVE ONE, THE GOS HAS MADE SIMILAR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>PLEDGES TO IMPROVE JUDICIAL PROCEDURES IN THE PAST, </p><p>MOST NOTABLY TO AMBASSADOR CHEEK AND OTHER WESTERN </p><p>DIPLOMATS IN MAY, 1991.  THESE PROMISES NEVER </p><p>MATERIALIZED.  FOR NOW, IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO ADOPT </p><p>A POSITION OF "WAIT AND SEE."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  ON JULY 27, PRESIDENT OMAR BASHIR ISSUED A </p><p>RESOLUTION RELEASING THOSE PERSONS SENTENCED FIFTEEN </p><p>YEARS OR LESS FOR "CRIMES AGAINST STATE SECURITY." </p><p>BASHIR ALSO REDUCED LIFE IMPRISONMENT AND TWENTY </p><p>YEARS\' IMPRISONMENT TERMS BY HALF.  THE FOLLOWING </p><p>DAY, SUDAN\'S DIRECTOR OF PRISONS ANNOUNCED THAT 54 </p><p>PRISONERS HAD BEEN FREED, FROM A TOTAL OF 74 </p><p>INVOLVED IN COUP PLOTS.  THE RELEASEES, HE SAID, </p><p>INCLUDED 27 PERSONS BEING HELD IN KHARTOUM STATE </p><p>PRISONS (17 MILITARY PERSONNEL AND 11 CIVILIANS WERE </p><p>RELEASED FROM KOBER PRISON IN KHARTOUM).  THE </p><p>REMAINDER CAME FROM PENAL INSTITUTIONS IN OTHER </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ON JULY 30, GOS-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPER, </p><p>"SUDAN AL-HADITH" PUBLISHED THE NAMES OF THOSE FREED </p><p>FROM THE VARIOUS PRISONS THROUGHOUT SUDAN (SHALLA, </p><p>PORT SUDAN, SUAKIN, EL OBEID, ETC).  THE NUMBERS </p><p>ALSO TOTAL 54.  (THE ARTICLE, HOWEVER, GIVES </p><p>DIFFERENT FIGURES FOR KOBAR PRISON RELEASES--16 </p><p>ONLY.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  IN ADDITION TO LISTING SEVERAL AUGUST, 1991 </p><p>COUP PLOTTERS NOW FREED, SUCH AS COL. (RTD) MUSTAFA </p><p>YOUSIF AL-TINAI, LT. COL. HAMADTU HUSSEIN IBRAHIM, </p><p>AND GEN. (RTD) MOHAMMED OSMAN ABDALLAH HILAYFI, THE </p><p>NEWS ARTICLE NAMES LONG-TIME DETAINEES, STANISLAUS </p><p>KAW, HENRY TONG AND ABDEL GADIR ALI HAMID.  THESE </p><p>MEN WERE, ALONG WITH DR. AHMED OSMAN SIRAJ, </p><p>ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN THE SEPTEMBER, 1990 COUP </p><p>PLOT.  "SUDAN AL-HADITH" ALSO REPORTS THAT THE LIFE </p><p>SENTENCES FOR ABDEL RAHMAN ABDALLAH NUGUDALLAH, UMMA </p><p>POLITICIAN, AND HASHIM AL KHEIR HASHIM, BOTH </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE AUGUST, 1991 PLOT, WERE </p><p>REDUCED--ALBEIT TO UNSPECIFIED TERMS.  (NOTE: </p><p>DESPITE GOS ASSERTIONS THAT THE RELEASES HAVE </p><p>ALREADY OCCURRED, WE HAVE INITIAL REPORTS THAT THOSE </p><p>IMPRISONED IN DARFUR, THE EAST, AND OTHER OUT-LYING </p><p>REGIONS HAVE YET TO BE FREED DUE TO PRACTICAL </p><p>DELAYS.  THESE RELEASES ARE EXPECTED SOON.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY THAT THE </p><p>AMNESTY/REDUCTION OF SENTENCES WILL AFFECT THOSE </p><p>PERSONS SUCH AS COL. NASR HASAN BASHIR NASR, </p><p>RECENTLY SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR ESPIONAGE, AND SID </p><p>AHMED AL-HUSSEIN, CURRENTLY BEING TRIED IN THE WEST </p><p>FOR RECRUITING FOR THE SPLA.  SOME OBSERVERS HERE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT COL. NASR\'S DEATH SENTENCE IS LIKELY TO </p><p>BE COMMUTED TO A PRISON TERM.  THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED </p><p>REPORTS THAT CHIEF JUSTICE LUTFI HAS ALREADY DONE </p><p>THIS.  WHEN SID AHMED\'S CASE IS FINALLY RESOLVED, </p><p>SOME BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER SENTENCE HE RECEIVES IS </p><p>ALSO LIKELY TO BE REDUCED.  FOR NOW, HOWEVER, THIS </p><p>REMAINS SPECULATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  ON JULY 27, BASHIR ALSO DECLARED THAT, </p><p>HENCEFORTH, ALL STATE SECURITY CASES WILL BE </p><p>PUBLICLY TRIED AND DEFENDANTS WILL BE PERMITTED </p><p>DEFENSE ATTORNEYS.  FURTHER, ANYONE BELIEVING THAT </p><p>HIS RIGHTS HAVE BEEN ABUSED IS FREE TO SUBMIT HIS </p><p>CASE TO THE COURTS.  ATTORNEY GENERAL DR. ABDALLAH </p><p>IDRISS, PRESENT WITH BASHIR FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT, </p><p>ADDED THAT THOSE CURRENTLY UNDER PREVENTIVE </p><p>DETENTION AND THOSE PREVIOUSLY DETAINED MAY, IF THEY </p><p>WISH, SUBMIT A GRIEVANCE, WITH SUPPORTING EVIDENCE, </p><p>TO A JUDGE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  WHILE THESE RELEASES ARE A WELCOME </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, WE RECALL THAT IN MAY 1991, SENIOR GOS </p><p>OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THEN-POLITICAL ADVISOR, DR. </p><p>GHAZI SALAH EDDIN, RCC MEMBER COL. KHALIFAH AND </p><p>THEN-JUSTICE MINISTRY UNDERSECRETARY ALI YASIN, </p><p>ASSURED AMBASSADOR CHEEK AND OTHER WESTERN </p><p>AMBASSADORS THAT POLITICAL DETENTIONS WOULD BE </p><p>SUBJECT TO STRICTER JUDICIAL SUPERVISION AND REVIEW </p><p>(REF).  ALSO, POLITICAL DETAINEES WOULD HAVE THE </p><p>RIGHT TO PRESS CHARGES OF ALLEGED PHYSICAL </p><p>MISTREATMENT IN THE COURTS.  THE GOS REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>PROUDLY PROCLAIMED THESE PLANNED HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR, ADMITTEDLY, SKEPTICAL </p><p>AUDIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  FIFTEEN MONTHS LATER, HOWEVER, NONE OF </p><p>THESE GOS PROMISES HAD MATERIALIZED.  IF ANYTHING, </p><p>SECURITY PERSONNEL SEEMED TO ENJOY EVEN GREATER </p><p>FREEDOM OF OPERATION WITH LESS OVERSIGHT.  WHAT DID </p><p>CHANGE WAS THE PATTERN OF POLITICAL DETENTIONS: </p><p>SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS USED GHOST HOUSES RATHER THAN </p><p>PRISONS TO HOLD DETAINEES.  IN THESE SECRET GHOST </p><p>HOUSES, SECURITY PERSONNEL ARE BETTER PLACED TO </p><p>COMMIT ABUSES SUCH AS PHYSICAL MISTREATMENT/TORTURE </p><p>AND BETTER ABLE TO ARREST PEOPLE AS THEY FEEL </p><p>INCLINED.  ALSO, REPEATED ARRESTS OF THE SAME </p><p>INDIVIDUAL WERE NOT UNCOMMON SINCE, UNLIKE IN FORMAL </p><p>PRISONS, LEGAL RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT IN GHOST HOUSES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  WE MUST ALSO CAUTION THAT UNDER THIS </p><p>REGIME, EVEN OPEN TRIALS MAY NOT GUARANTEE JUSTICE. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECENT TRIAL OF COL. NASR--FOR </p><p>ESPIONAGE--WAS AN OPEN ONE, BUT BY ALL ACCOUNTS, </p><p>LITTLE DUE PROCESS WAS EVIDENT.  AT HIS TRIAL, COL. </p><p>NASR REPORTEDLY DECLARED HE HAD BEEN BEATEN AND </p><p>POINTED TO HIS ALLEGED TORTURER, PRESENT IN THE </p><p>COURT ROOM.  NONETHELESS, HE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND </p><p>SENTENCED TO DEATH. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  THAT SAID, THE JULY 27 ANNOUNCEMENT CAME </p><p>AS A SURPRISE HERE AND MANY OBSERVERS ARE </p><p>SPECULATING AS TO THE REASONS BEHIND THE MOVE.  THE </p><p>GOS HAS PUBLICLY STRESSED THAT THE DECISION CAME AS </p><p>THE RESULT OF A PETITION FROM SUDAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ORGANIZATION (A GOS ORGAN) AND ITS NEW ISLAMIC HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ASSOCIATION.  NO ONE BELIEVES THIS.  SOME, </p><p>CITING NIF SOURCES, SAY THAT HASSAN TURABI WAS SO </p><p>IMPRESSED WITH HIS U.S. VISIT, THAT HE GAVE THE </p><p>"GREEN LIGHT" TO THE RELEASES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.  (COMMENT:  HIGHLY </p><p>DOUBTFUL).  OTHERS CITE A RECENT ARAB LAWYERS GROUP </p><p>MEETING IN CAIRO CONDEMNING SUDAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ABUSES (SOMETIMES A PRECURSOR TO PRISONER RELEASES </p><p>HERE). </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  WHATEVER THE REASON, IT WOULD BE NAIVE TO </p><p>ASSUME THAT GOS HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES WILL IMPROVE </p><p>FOR THE SUDANESE OPPOSITION OR FOR THOSE UNFORTUNATE </p><p>INNOCENTS ROUNDED UP ON THE WHIM OF SECURITY </p><p>AGENTS.  THE TREMENDOUS GAP BETWEEN WHAT THE GOS </p><p>SAYS AND WHAT IT DOES IS A COMMON FEATURE OF LIFE </p><p>HERE.  IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT EXPECT THE GOS TO </p><p>SEPARATE ITSELF FROM THE ACTIONS OF ITS SECURITY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  DCM WAS RECENTLY TOLD BY MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE NIF THAT DE FACTO HEAD OF SECURITY, DR. NAFI ALI </p><p>NAFI, WILL REMAIN IN HIS JOB.  THE GOS IS GOING TO </p><p>HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME IN PROVING IN THE WEEKS AND </p><p>MONTHS AHEAD THAT--AS PROMINENTLY PLASTERED IN NEWS </p><p>HEADLINES HERE--"TOLERANCE IS PRACTISED" IN SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
