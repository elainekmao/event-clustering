CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY:  THE GOS HAS NOT TAKEN SPECIFIC </p><p>ACTION AGAINST KURDISH GROUPS AS A RESULT OF </p><p>THE NOVEMBER 4 ATTACKS ON TURKISH </p><p>ESTABLISHMENTS IN SWITZERLAND.  THE TURKISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS REITERATED ITS REQUEST THAT THE </p><p>PKK BE BANNED IN SWITZERLAND, BUT THE GOS SAYS </p><p>THAT THE GROUP DOES NOT FORMALLY EXIST HERE. </p><p>AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACKS, SWISS POLICE ARE </p><p>WATCHING KURDISH GROUPS MORE CLOSELY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3. AS REPORTED REF B, A SERIES OF ARSON </p><p>ATTACKS ON TURKISH ESTABLISHMENTS WERE CARRIED </p><p>OUT NOVEMBER 4 IN SEVERAL SWISS LOCALITIES: </p><p>BERN, ZURICH, BASEL, OLTEN, SOLOTHURN, AND </p><p>BIBEREST.  AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON THREW A </p><p>MOLOTOV COCKTAIL AT THE TURKISH </p><p>EMBASSY BUILDING IN BERN; NO DAMAGE WAS </p><p>REPORTED.  NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THE INCIDENTS.  ONE </p><p>SUSPECT HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN ZURICH. </p><p> </p><p>4. SWISS AUTHORITIES HAVE TAKEN A LOW-KEY </p><p>APPROACH TO THE ATTACKS.  DFA DIVISION I (US </p><p>AND EUROPE) DEPUTY DIRECTOR PHILIPPE WELTI </p><p>TOLD US ON NOVEMBER 10 THAT THE NOVEMBER 4 </p><p>ATTACKS WERE NOT AS SERIOUS AS THE JUNE 24 </p><p>INCIDENTS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEREFORE </p><p>SAW NO NEED TO TAKE SPECIFIC ACTION OR TO MAKE </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC COMMENT.  WELTI SAID THE </p><p>DFA RELEASED A BRIEF PRESS COMMUNIQUE AFTER </p><p>THE NOVEMBER 4 ATTACKS WHICH CONTAINED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE DFA CONDEMNS THE ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SWISS GOVERNMENT WILL NOT TOLERATE ACTS </p><p>OF VIOLENCE EVEN IF UNDERTAKEN FOR POLITICAL </p><p>PURPOSES. </p><p> </p><p>AS FAR AS WELTI CAN DETERMINE, THIS COMMUNIQUE </p><p>WAS IGNORED BY THE SWISS MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>5. WELTI TOLD US THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>NOT FORMALLY CONTACTED THE GOS REGARDING THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 4 ATTACKS BUT HAD REITERATED ITS </p><p>REQUEST FOR A BAN ON THE PKK IN SWITZERLAND. </p><p> </p><p>6. WELTI COMMENTED THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE FORMAL ACTION </p><p>AGAINST THE PKK, WHICH HAS NO CORPORATE </p><p>IDENTITY IN SWITZERLAND.  HE SAID THAT MANY </p><p>TURKISH KURDS RESIDE LEGALLY IN SWITZERLAND. </p><p>SOME PARTICIPATE IN RATHER INNOCUOUS-SOUNDING </p><p>GROUPS, E.G., SPORTS AND SOCIAL CLUBS.  THE </p><p>GOS KNOWS SOME OF THE GROUPS HAVE PKK TIES, </p><p>BUT THE PKK ITSELF HAS NO OFFICIAL </p><p>HEADQUARTERS.  WELTI ADDED THAT THE SWISS </p><p>POLICE WERE OBSERVING KURDISH GROUPS MORE </p><p>CLOSELY AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>FLORA </p><p></p></div>
