<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003312 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND S/ES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OVIP, PROP, PINS, NI (BUSH GEORGE W.) </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: SOME ISLAMIC CLERICS OBJECT TO </p><p>POTUS VISIT </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Abuja 3296 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  "Daily Trust," a Northern-oriented independent </p><p>newspaper based in Abuja, December 11 published a page </p><p>four article reporting the call by some Muslim clerics </p><p>in far-northern Katsina that the Government of Nigeria </p><p>cancel President Bush\'s visit if reports of an </p><p>upcoming visit are true. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>You are not welcome, Muslim clerics tell Bush </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>From Abdu Labaran, in Katsina </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As the rumours of the impending visit of the American </p><p>President, George W. Bush, continue to make the </p><p>rounds, a groundswell of opposition to the visit is </p><p>already building up with Muslim clerics in Katsina </p><p>State telling the American number one citizen to stay </p><p>away from Nigeria as he is not welcome. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Uztaz Khalid Yunus and Ustaz AbdulBasir Unguwar Kawo </p><p>Kankara, two firebrand clerics of the Izalatul Bid\'a </p><p>wa Ikamatus Sunna (Izala) Movement, expressed their </p><p>opposition to the visit in separate interviews with </p><p>Daily Trust, asserting that the American president\'s </p><p>visit to Nigeria will not benefit the country in any </p><p>way. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The clerics maintained that the visit "far from doing </p><p>any good to Nigerians will only further expose us to </p><p>more hardship as our meager resources will be </p><p>committed to hosting the visitor and his entourage, in </p><p>addition to the visit sending the wrong signal to the </p><p>Islamic and peace-loving communities that Nigeria not </p><p>only supports but endorses America\'s gang up policy </p><p>against weaker nations and its global anti-Islam </p><p>agenda." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ustaz Khalid Yunus, who only last week Friday led a </p><p>moving prayer (Al-Qunut) that lasted for up to 20 </p><p>minutes after the Juma\'at prayer, viewed the visit as </p><p>a bad omen to Nigeria, expressing the believe (sic) </p><p>that nothing will bring the American president to </p><p>Nigeria if there is nothing in the visit for his </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"As far as American leadership is concerned, there is </p><p>only one interest and one world view; which is </p><p>America," he stated, saying that to expect President </p><p>Bush to come to Nigeria in the interest of Nigeria is </p><p>simply foolhardy as, according to him, the American </p><p>government does not think much of our country given </p><p>the treatment meted out to Nigerians visiting the US. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Calling on the Federal Government to call off the </p><p>visit if it is true, he asserted that the visit will </p><p>not benefit Nigeria since the several visits to </p><p>America by President Obasanjo have not helped Nigeria </p><p>or Nigerians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ustaz AbdulBasir, who also led in a special prayer </p><p>(Salatul Haja) on Saturday at Kofar Kaura Mosque where </p><p>the US, Britain and Israel were the target of the </p><p>prayer and special lecture, condemned the American </p><p>president\'s proposed visit to Nigeria, describing the </p><p>motive behind the visit as suspect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He alleged that the motive of President Bush\'s visit </p><p>to Nigeria may not be unconnected with his </p><p>government\'s desire to drum up support for its </p><p>aggression against Saddam\'s Iraq and Israel\'s </p><p>aggression against Palestinians and their government </p><p>as well as America\'s thirst for Nigeria\'s crude oil. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Vowing to intensify prayers in mosques, he called on </p><p>Nigerians of all religions and the National Assembly </p><p>to prevail on President Obasanjo not to welcome the </p><p>American president and his entourage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Katsina is home to a particularly conservative </p><p>element of Muslim society and a small but growing </p><p>number of militant fundamentalists. Its  border with </p><p>Niger permits easy interaction with extremists based </p><p>in that country (see also reftel).  The attitudes </p><p>expressed in the article will find some resonance </p><p>among like-minded opponents of secular government </p><p>generally and the West (especially the U.S.) </p><p>particularly.  However, a solid majority of Nigerian </p><p>Muslims would welcome a visit by President Bush. </p><p>The Embassy will continue to monitor media and other </p><p>sources for echoes of this article. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
