(C) Summary: Despite reform legislation allowing Kurdish </p><p>language courses, bureaucratic regulations place prohibitive </p><p>costs by requiring that the courses be established in </p><p>separate institutions, rather than added to existing schools. </p><p> The owner of a chain of language schools says there is not </p><p>enough demand for Kurdish courses to cover the costs of </p><p>establishing a separate institution.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) As part of its August 2002 reform package (Reftel A), </p><p>Parliament passed legislation allowing the establishment of </p><p>private courses in Kurdish and other "languages and dialects </p><p>traditionally used by Turkish citizens in their daily lives." </p><p> Nazif Ulgen, the Istanbul-based owner of the English Fast </p><p>language schools, told Poloff January 23 that he had applied </p><p>for approval to open a Kurdish course shortly after the new </p><p>law was adopted.  However, Education Ministry officials in </p><p>October told him the regulations implementing the law do not </p><p>allow Kurdish courses to be added to existing institutions; a </p><p>new institution must be created, with a separate building, </p><p>management, and secretarial staff.  Ulgen said interest in </p><p>private Kurdish courses is limited, and the costs of creating </p><p>a separate institution are prohibitive.  If he were allowed </p><p>to add Kurdish courses to his five schools -- which offer </p><p>English, French and German -- he estimated he could attract a </p><p>total of about 100 students.  There is no profit to be made </p><p>in teaching Kurdish, but, as a Kurd himself, he would do it </p><p>on principle.  However, he said, the roughly USD 100,000 it </p><p>would cost to create a separate institution will prevent </p><p>anyone from establishing Kurdish courses.  Both Ulgen and our </p><p>GOT contacts said they believe Ulgen is the only one to apply </p><p>so far for Kurdish courses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Inan Ozyildiz, international affairs advisor to the </p><p>President, told Poloff he had heard about Ulgen\'s situation. </p><p>Ozyildiz opined that it will "eventually" be resolved.  The </p><p>Education Ministry may revise its interpretation of the </p><p>regulation, or, if necessary, the GOT may draft a new </p><p>regulation.  He said Turkey is in the early stages of a </p><p>reform process.  There are still many flaws, but the overall </p><p>trend is clearly positive.  "We want to see these rights and </p><p>freedoms fully implemented.  We don\'t want to see them only </p><p>on paper," he averred.  Ulgen too is surprisingly optimistic. </p><p> He is frustrated that he is unable to take advantage of the </p><p>language reforms, despite 25 years\' experience running </p><p>language schools.  "If you don\'t trust established </p><p>organizations, whom will you trust?" he asked.  Still, he </p><p>believes the regulations will eventually have to be loosened </p><p>as Parliament continues to lift restrictions on freedom of </p><p>expression, though it may take years.  He blamed the current </p><p>roadblock on a bureaucracy dominated by a "nationalistic </p><p>mentality" that views expanded freedoms as threats to the </p><p>State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ulgen is one of a number of Embassy contacts who have </p><p>recently stressed their belief that the Turkish bureaucracy </p><p>opposes GOT reforms and is working to undermine them.  It is </p><p>a difficult argument to refute, as there have been a series </p><p>of bureaucratic regulations undermining the spirit of reform </p><p>legislation.  In addition to the restrictions on Kurdish </p><p>courses, the bureaucracy has also placed tight limits on </p><p>Kurdish broadcasts (Reftel B) and the rights of minority </p><p>foundations to own property (Reftel C). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
