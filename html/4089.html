<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 KATHMANDU 002045 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>MANILA FOR ADB </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: FOLLOW-ON TO THE CONFERENCE ON NEPAL IN LONDON: </p><p>DONOR REPS IN KATHMANDU ENDORSE CONTINUING SUPPORT DESIPITE </p><p>MAOIST CRISIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASONS: 1.5 ( </p><p>b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  The British Embassy in Kathmandu convened a </p><p>meeting on October 11 of representatives of bilateral and </p><p>multilateral donors to Nepal as a follow-up to the London </p><p>meeting on Nepal in June.  Despite continuing donor </p><p>disquietude about Nepal\'s political and security problems, </p><p>there was fundamental consensus among the 22 donors that the </p><p>international community should recognize the constraints </p><p>imposed on the Government of Nepal by the Maoist insurgency </p><p>and not impose unreasonable preconditions for continuing </p><p>developmental assistance.  This meeting is being viewed by </p><p>the British Embassy as the activation of an "International </p><p>Contact Group" that will meet periodically to maintain the </p><p>momentum and coordination begun in London.  Reservations by </p><p>the Indian and Chinese Governments have forced the FCO to </p><p>revise its initial proposals for a more elaborate </p><p>architecture of multilateral dialogue on Nepal.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The British Embassy in Kathmandu took advantage of the </p><p>visit to Kathmandu of Undersecretary of State of the UK, Mike </p><p>O\'Brien, to convene a meeting of 22 bilateral and </p><p>multilateral donors and representatives of the Nepalese </p><p>Government and military.  The meeting was billed as a </p><p>follow-up to the International Meeting on Nepal held in </p><p>London in June 2002 although this meeting\'s abbreviated </p><p>length (two hours) necessitated a much more general, less </p><p>comprehensive discussion than had occurred in London.  There </p><p>was little discussion of specific developmental aid since the </p><p>June meeting and no discussion of security assistance by any </p><p>of the participants.  Mike O\'Brien made clear that his </p><p>Embassy intended to issue a Chairman\'s Statement at the </p><p>conclusion of the meeting which would attempt to capture the </p><p>spirit of the meeting, but which would not be a formally </p><p>cleared, multilateral document.  (See para 10 for the final </p><p>version of the Chairman\'s Statement.)  Several </p><p>representatives specified that the meeting must be considered </p><p>informal, since they had no authorization from their capitals </p><p>to participate in a more structured contact group. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador Malinowski set the tone of the subsequent </p><p>discussion by pressing for an appropriately strong </p><p>condemnation of Maoist tactics, including terrorism, human </p><p>rights abuses against civilians, and destruction of economic </p><p>and social infrastructure.  He said that he had received </p><p>repeated assurances from GON leaders that the Government was </p><p>willing to negotiate with the Maoists when the climate for a </p><p>fruitful political process had been created.  The Ambassador </p><p>reiterated the interest of the US in social and political </p><p>reform, including the reduction of corruption, but argued </p><p>that unreasonable preconditions should not be imposed on </p><p>Nepal during this time of crisis.  He acknowledged that the </p><p>operations of the GON security forces do sometimes obstruct </p><p>the free flow of food to insurgency-affected areas, but the </p><p>root cause of this was Maoist depredations.   He urged the </p><p>donors not just to complain about or solely criticize GON </p><p>actions or inactions, but to be prepared to work with the GON </p><p>in efforts to effectively combat the insurgency and to </p><p>develop -- like the U.S. and the UK -- new programs to </p><p>specifically help the GON counter the Maoists. USAID/NEPAL </p><p>Director Joanne Hale called upon the donor community to join </p><p>the US in strengthening the rural justice system, the lacunae </p><p>in which tend to be filled by Maoist summary courts.  Hale </p><p>also described USAID plans to rebuild, through quick </p><p>income-generating programs,  rural infrastructure destroyed </p><p>by the Maoists and to rehabilitate child victims of Maoist </p><p>violence.  Hale pledged USAID\'s willingness to work with </p><p>other donors on our new programs. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Russian and Australian Ambassadors and the Danish </p><p>Representative agreed that the Chairman\'s Statement should </p><p>give stronger emphasis to the Maoists\' destruction of </p><p>infrastructure.  The German Ambassador too agreed that the </p><p>Chairman\'s Statement should place stronger onus on the </p><p>Maoists as the root cause of many of Nepal\'s current </p><p>problems, but felt that some criticism of the GON was </p><p>justified.  The Norwegian Ambassador--usually a vocal critic </p><p>of the GON--acknowledged that progress on reforms was being </p><p>achieved due to the dedicated efforts of some civil servants </p><p>and members of civil society, but expressed concern that </p><p>governmental corruption is being aggravated by Maoist </p><p>extortion.  Although the Government\'s counterinsurgency </p><p>operations did place unfortunate restriction on the movement </p><p>of food and medicines to some areas, she said, the morale of </p><p>the security forces is important and should be bolstered by </p><p>increased development expenditure in the rural areas.  The </p><p>Indian Charge emphasized the importance of supporting Nepal\'s </p><p>fledgling democracy and constitutional monarchy.  The donor </p><p>community should do nothing, he warned, to lower the morale </p><p>of the Nepalese people, Government or security forces.  He </p><p>urged the donor community to reiterate its support for the </p><p>security and development of Nepal.  The Chinese Ambassador </p><p>predictably warned against foreign interference in the </p><p>internal affairs of the Kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The representatives of three leading multilateral </p><p>donors--the IBRD, UNDP, and ADB--expressed striking unanimity </p><p>on the following points: </p><p> </p><p>-- Nepal is now in the throes an unprecedented economic and </p><p>developmental crisis; </p><p> </p><p>-- Donors should not give the impression that the GON bears </p><p>primary responsibility for this crisis, since this would only </p><p>strengthen the hand of the Maoists; </p><p> </p><p>-- The international community must recognize the devastating </p><p>impact that the Maoist insurgency is having on the capacity </p><p>of the government to deliver social services and implement </p><p>development programs; </p><p> </p><p>-- Donors should not try to dictate a schedule for GON </p><p>negotiations with the Maoists nor set unrealistic political </p><p>preconditions for the continuation of developmental support. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The GON was represented by several senior Foreign </p><p>Ministry officials, a member of the National Planning </p><p>Commission, and a major general working in the National </p><p>Security Council Secretariat.  The ranking Foreign Ministry </p><p>representative presented the donors with the Government\'s </p><p>"Action Plan to Exppedite Reforms."  The major general argued </p><p>forcefully for more international resources to rehabilitate </p><p>surrendered Maoists and the victims of Maoist violence. </p><p> </p><p>7.

(C) Comment.  The tenor of the October Donors\' Meeting in </p><p>Kathmandu essentially replicated that of the June meeting in </p><p>London.  The local donor representatives are deeply concerned </p><p>about the continuing deterioration in Nepal\'s economic </p><p>situation, which they attribute primarily to the Maoists. </p><p>Although they hold the GON responsible for administrative </p><p>lapses and political infighting, they do not want to issue </p><p>public statements or set political preconditions that would </p><p>encourage the Maoists to believe that international opinion </p><p>is shifting in their favor.  They were particularly cautious </p><p>about making political statements on October 11, the same day </p><p>that the King announced his appointment of a new prime </p><p>minister and a number of new cabinet ministers.  Many donor </p><p>representatives are concerned about the series of political </p><p>missteps by the elected government that led the King to </p><p>dissolve the Cabinet on October 4, and are reporting </p><p>pressures from their capitals to justify continued </p><p>development assistance in the face of Maoist violence and </p><p>constitutional issues in Kathmandu.  The donor community is </p><p>united, however, in giving the King the benefit of the doubt </p><p>as his new government takes steps against governmental </p><p>corruption and tries to establish a modus vivendi with the </p><p>political parties that would provide a common front in future </p><p>negotiations with the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment, continued.  Since the October 11 confab at </p><p>the British Embassy, Ambassador Malinowski has consulted </p><p>repeatedly with his British counterpart Keith Bloomfield </p><p>about additional steps to maintain the momentum created by </p><p>the June meeting on Nepal in London.  The October 11 meeting, </p><p>Bloomfield explained, might be considered the activation of </p><p>the most comprehensive of four multilateral working groups on </p><p>Nepal endorsed by the FCO.  Unfortunately, he said, both the </p><p>Indian and Chinese Governments, with which the British </p><p>Government has consulted about its proposed four working </p><p>groups, have declined to participate in multilateral </p><p>discussions focussing narrowly on Nepali security or </p><p>political issues.  Ambassadors Malinowski and Bloomfield </p><p>agreed that, despite Indian and Chinese misgivings, </p><p>international dialogue and coordination on Nepal should be </p><p>pursued as far as practicable.  The British Embassy here is </p><p>consulting with FCO on a concept for a more limited </p><p>architecture of discussions.  Embassy will keep Department </p><p>informed as this revised proposal takes firmer shape.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Final text of final British Chairman\'s Statement </p><p>(issued October 22): </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p>"The international meeting on Nepal held in London in June </p><p>2002 noted the deep concern of the international community </p><p>over the conflict in Nepal, particularly the vicious Maoist </p><p>outrages as well as human rights abuses.  The participants in </p><p>the meeting agreed that an integrated approach of security, </p><p>reform and development was necessary to address the conflict. </p><p> The meeting recognized that the basis for international </p><p>support for such an approach would be democratic political </p><p>leadership committed to tackling corruption and building </p><p>national consensus, whilst determinedly pursuing a strong </p><p>security response. </p><p> </p><p>We note that since the meeting in June, the people of Nepal </p><p>have continued to suffer.  We condemn the threat to democracy </p><p>posed by the continuing Maoist insurgency and the wanton </p><p>destruction of life and property by them and insist that </p><p>political change will not be brought about by violence.  We </p><p>unreservedly condemn all acts of terrorism and abuses of </p><p>human rights.  The community gives strong support to the </p><p>government which has begun to address reform and development </p><p>through the immediate action plan and to provide peace, </p><p>protection and security to all its citizens, and regrets that </p><p>the security situation did not allow local and national </p><p>elections to be held this year, </p><p> </p><p>This meeting reviewed and welcomed progress and urges the </p><p>Government of Nepal and the international community to </p><p>continue implementing the London recommendations, </p><p>particularly in the following areas: </p><p> </p><p>-- Security:  The meeting welcomed recent security efforts </p><p>and supports the government\'s determination to show the </p><p>Maoists that they cannot win by violence; </p><p>-- Cross-Party Approach:  By seeking to develop a cross-party </p><p>political process which ends the violence; </p><p>-- Corruption:  The meeting welcomed the new anti-corruption </p><p>law and progress by the CIAA in investigating corruption </p><p>allegations and urges the Government to ensure legal action </p><p>is taken against those who breach a position of trust; those </p><p>who pay bribes are to be condemned as much as those who </p><p>receive them. </p><p>-- Development:  Within security constraints by increasing </p><p>visible development efforts particularly in the mid- and </p><p>far-west of the country, including by improving the </p><p>circumstances of dalits, women and ethnic groups.  There also </p><p>needs to be continued efforts to coordinate activities by the </p><p>development agencies to coordinate their efforts and to work </p><p>with the Nepalese Government; </p><p>-- Human Rights:  The meeting welcomed the commitment of the </p><p>government to human rights and international humanitarian </p><p>standards and particularly the establishment of the human </p><p>rights cell in the Royal Nepal Army, and urges the government </p><p>to investigate thoroughly allegations of human rights </p><p>violations and seek the prosecution of offenders, as well as </p><p>redress and rehabilitation of victims; </p><p>-- Democracy:  By setting quickly a timetable for elections </p><p>for local representative bodies and parliament; </p><p>-- Food and Medicine:  By seeking to get food and medicine to </p><p>all areas of the country without artificial hindrances; </p><p>-- Reform:  The meeting welcomed progress made and urges the </p><p>government to accelerate reform in key areas of central </p><p>government to enable the authorities to effectively tackle </p><p>the causes of the conflict, deliver services and support </p><p>democracy. </p><p> </p><p>This meeting believes that continued progress on these points </p><p>is desirable particularly through: </p><p> </p><p>-- practical support for a resolution of the conflict; </p><p>-- further support for reform and development in nepal; </p><p>-- support for post-conflict reconstruction in nepal. </p><p> </p><p>This meeting agreed to convene further meetings to coordinate </p><p>help for Nepal in tackling the current crisis and long term </p><p>problems." </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
