(C)  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  ECMIN AND ECONOFF MET ON APRIL </p><p>11 WITH ANTONIO BADINI, MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST AND COORDINATOR OF ITALY\'S IRAQ TASK FORCE.  BADINI WAS </p><p>JOINED BY IRAQ OFFICE DIRECTOR LUIGI MACCOTTA.  AT THE TIME </p><p>OF THE MEETING, A TASK FORCE PROPOSAL, ENDORSED BY FM </p><p>FRATTINI, WAS PENDING APPROVAL BY PM BERLUSCONI AND THE </p><p>COUNCIL OF MINISTERS.  SHORTLY AFTER OUR DISCUSSION, MACCOTTA </p><p>INFORMED US THAT THE COUNCIL HAD APPROVED THE PROPOSAL </p><p>AFFIRMING THE COORDINATING ROLE OF THE MFA ON IRAQ ASSISTANCE </p><p>AS WELL AS ITS THREE-PART PLAN.  THE ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN, AS </p><p>DESCRIBED BY BADINI ARE:  1) TO FIELD A 1,000 PERSON </p><p>SELF-PROTECTED HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE TEAM COMPOSED OF ROUGHLY </p><p>500 MILITARY PERSONNEL (CARABINIERI AND ARMY) AND 500 </p><p>CIVILIAN MEDICAL, WATER, SANITATION, CIVIL ENGINEERING, AND </p><p>WMD SPECIALISTS; 2)  TO IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF ITALIAN EXPERTS </p><p>THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE THEIR EXPERTISE IN THE REBUILDING OF </p><p>IRAQI ADMINISTRATIVE INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN THE PROVISION </p><p>OF HEALTH, WATER, SANITATION, ELECTRICITY, AND PERHAPS OTHER </p><p>AREAS (THE MFA ENVISIONS EMBEDDING THESE EXPERTS WITHIN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01577  01 OF 02  141056Z </p><p>NASCENT IRAQI MINISTRIES);  3) TO PROPOSE SECONDING A </p><p>HIGH-RANKING DIPLOMAT, WITH A GENERAL SERVING AS HIS MILITARY </p><p>AND SECURITY ADVISOR, TO WORK WITH ORHA AND COORDINATE </p><p>OVERALL GOI INVOLVEMENT ON THE GROUND. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY, COMMENT CONT\'D.  THE INTER-MINISTERIAL TASK </p><p>FORCE HAS BEEN WORKING ON ITS PROPOSAL FOR SOME TIME, AND HAD </p><p>NOT RECEIVED REFTEL B\'S SPECIFIC REQUEST FOR A FIELD HOSPITAL </p><p>FOR CIVILIANS BEFORE THE PROPOSAL WAS SUBMITTED TO THE </p><p>COUNCIL OF MINISTERS.  WE HAVE EXPLAINED THE COALITION\'S </p><p>URGENT NEED FOR A FIELD HOSPITAL (REFTEL A) AND ARE WORKING </p><p>WITH THE GOI TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FIRST PART OF ITALY\'S </p><p>OFFER CAN BE TAILORED TO SERVE AS A RAPIDLY DEPLOYABLE, </p><p>SELF-PROTECTING FIELD HOSPITAL.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DURING AN APRIL 11 MEETING WITH ECMIN, MINISTER BADINI </p><p>DESCRIBED THE INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE\'S THREE-PART PACKAGE, </p><p>WHICH HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE PM AND THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>MINISTERS FOR APPROVAL.  BADINI WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO </p><p>EXPLAIN THAT THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THE TASK FORCE\'S PACKAGE </p><p>-- A 1,000 PERSON TEAM OF CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS WITH MILITARY </p><p>SUPPORT -- INCLUDES MILITARY PERSONNEL TO SECURE AND </p><p>STABILIZE THE SITUATION SO THAT THE CIVILIAN TEAM CAN CONDUCT </p><p>ITS WORK EFFECTIVELY.   FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL REASONS,  IT </p><p>WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE MILITARY\'S ROLE BE CHARACTERIZED </p><p>NEITHER AS  "PEACEMAKING NOR PEACEKEEPING."   BADINI SAID </p><p>THAT FORMIN FRATTINI HAD ACCEPTED THIS DISTINCTION, AND WAS </p><p>MAKING THE CASE TO PM BERLUSCONI.  BADINI ADDED THAT, IN HIS </p><p>VIEW, IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO WAIT FOR EITHER AN EU, UN, OR </p><p>NATO MANDATE TO ACT GIVEN THE FOOT-DRAGGING OF OTHER MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01577  01 OF 02  141056Z </p><p>5. (C) IN THIS CONTEXT, BADINI WARMLY WELCOMED THE USG </p><p>REQUEST FOR A FIELD HOSPITAL (REF A).  HE NOTED THAT HEALTH </p><p>AND SANITATION WERE AMONG THE CORE COMPETENCIES THAT THE TASK </p><p>FORCE HAD IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITY CONTRIBUTIONS TO IRAQ. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE APPROPRIATE ELEMENTS NEEDED TO RESPOND TO THE </p><p>REQUEST COULD, HE SAID, BE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED FROM WITHIN THE </p><p>1,000 PERSON TEAM PROPOSED IN THE TASK FORCE PACKAGE.  BADINI </p><p>NOTED THAT ITALY\'S EXPERIENCE REHABILITATING A GENERAL </p><p>HOSPITAL AND A PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL IN BAGHDAD AFTER THE 1991 </p><p>GULF WAR PROVIDED A GOOD BASE TO PLAN FROM.  BADINI ASSURED </p><p>US THAT THE TASK FORCE WOULD FOCUS IMMEDIATELY UPON THE </p><p>REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) REGARDING THE PROPOSAL TO SECOND A SENIOR ITALIAN </p><p>DIPLOMAT TO ORHA,  BADINI NOTED THAT ITALY\'S AMBASSADOR PARTI </p><p>IN KUWAIT, WHO HAS SERVED AS LIAISON WITH ORHA, WOULD NO </p><p>LONGER BE ABLE TO DO SO ONCE ORHA RELOCATES TO BAGHDAD. </p><p>WHILE THE DIPLOMAT AND THE GENERAL WOULD BOTH BE VERY SENIOR, </p><p>BADINI SAID IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THE GENERAL REPORT TO AND </p><p>ADVISE THE CIVILIAN DIPLOMATIC OFFICIAL.  BADINI ASKED </p><p>WHETHER IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE ITALIANS ON AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TEAM INVOLVED IN THE PROVISIONAL ADMINISTRATION </p><p>OF POST-WAR IRAQ, BOTH TO INTERFACE WITH GENERAL GARNER AND, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4197 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01577  02 OF 02  141056Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   NEA-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  PA-00    PM-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /002W </p><p>                  ------------------555368  141057Z /38 </p><p>O 141056Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9242 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY KUWAIT IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRAGUE IMMEDIATE </p><p>HQ EUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3-CI/ECJ23-H// IMMEDIATE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE IMMEDIATE </p><p>USTRANSCOM SCOTT AFB IL IMMEDIATE </p><p>USSTRATCOM OFFUTT AFB NE IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001577 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PMAT.

(C) BADINI ALSO EXPLAINED THAT PARLIAMENT WILL NEED TO </p><p>APPROVE A BILL THE TASK FORCE IS DRAFTING WHICH LAYS OUT BOTH </p><p>THE RATIONALE FOR ITALY\'S SENDING AN INTEGRATED MILITARY AND </p><p>CIVILIAN EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TEAM TO IRAQ AND </p><p>THE FUNDING REQUEST TO DO SO.  WHILE HE BELIEVES THAT FOR </p><p>POLITICAL REASONS PM BERLUSCONI WILL WANT TO GO THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL OF SUCH A BILL, BADINI CLARIFIED THAT </p><p>IT IS ALSO CONCEIVABLE THE PM WOULD CHOOSE TO SIMPLY </p><p>INFORM/CONSULT THE PARLIAMENT AND INSTEAD FIND THE FUNDING </p><p>THROUGH A REALLOCATION OF THE BUDGET. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  ACTION REQUESTS:  POST REQUESTS GUIDANCE ON WHETHER </p><p>THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THE GOI TASK FORCE\'S PACKAGE MEETS </p><p>COALITION NEEDS FOR A FIELD HOSPITAL.
