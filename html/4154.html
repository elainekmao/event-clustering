<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002381 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S DISCUSSION WITH MUGABE\'S CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In an October 30 conversation, the Ambassador and </p><p>Charles Utete -- President Mugabe\'s Chief of Staff -- </p><p>acknowledged the differences between our two governments but </p><p>agreed on the importance of keeping communication channels </p><p>open.  The Ambassador urged Utete to implement the Cabinet\'s </p><p>decision to accept food assistance containing GMO and to </p><p>facilitate GOZ approval of additional NGOs to conduct food </p><p>deliveries.  Utete said the fact that some NGOs were involved </p><p>in both political activities and food distribution created a </p><p>"perception problem" and he advised that the World Food </p><p>Program (WFP) keep this in mind when selecting implementing </p><p>partners.  He agreed to intervene to resolve the impasse in </p><p>Binga, where food deliveries were halted four weeks ago after </p><p>the opposition MDC won 16 of 21 rural council seats.  The </p><p>Ambassador lamented the extreme political polarization in </p><p>Zimbabwe and said any sustainable solution to the crisis </p><p>required both sides, as a first step, to recognize the </p><p>legitimacy of the other.  Utete said he did not disagree with </p><p>the Ambassador\'s points and would not try to excuse "anything </p><p>that\'s happened here," but he stressed that the process of </p><p>political and social development Zimbabwe was going through </p><p>now would not happen without hitches.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Let\'s Talk </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In an October 30 meeting with Charles Utete, </p><p>President Mugabe\'s Chief of Staff, the Ambassador noted that </p><p>there are areas of disagreement between the USG and the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe, but he emphasized the importance of </p><p>keeping communication channels open.   He stressed that </p><p>Zimbabwe is suffering from an interrelated set of crises and </p><p>that, while it was up to Zimbabweans to determine the way </p><p>forward, the United States was willing to be helpful in the </p><p>search for a solution.   Utete agreed on the importance of </p><p>dialogue.  He said the GOZ had the impression that the USG </p><p>had decided to keep it at arm\'s length and preferred to have </p><p>as little contact as possible.  Utete noted that he had had </p><p>frequent, productive interactions with the Ambassador\'s </p><p>predecessors.  The two governments would not always agree, he </p><p>said -- "that\'s impossible" -- but it was important to talk </p><p>about our differences. </p><p> </p><p>Food shortage </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The Ambassador noted that deliveries of </p><p>international food assistance were generally working well, </p><p>with the major exceptions of Binga and Insiza districts, </p><p>although GOZ concerns about GMO and suspicions of some NGOs </p><p>was slowing the process down unnecessarily.  Despite </p><p>President Mugabe\'s assurances to WFP head James Morris in </p><p>August to accept food assistance containing GMO and a </p><p>subsequent endorsement of that decision by Cabinet, the </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture still had not signed the required </p><p>paperwork for deliveries to move forward.  There is also an </p><p>urgent need, the Ambassador continued, for Government </p><p>approval of additional NGOs to distribute food, as only </p><p>abvout a third of the districts that need assistance are </p><p>currently getting it.  He noted that food deliveries in Binga </p><p>had been suspended by local authorities four weeks ago after </p><p>the MDC won 16 of 21 seats in the rural council elections, </p><p>and by WFP in Insiza after ruling party supporters stole </p><p>three metric tons of food.  The Ambassador urged that these </p><p>two situations be resolved expeditiously. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In response, Utete said he knew the Ambassador </p><p>appreciated the controversy surrounding GMO.  Despite the </p><p>speculation about possible negative long-term health effects, </p><p>the GOZ had decided to accept food containing GMO under </p><p>specified conditions.  He was, therefore, "surprised to hear </p><p>that the bureaucratic wheels were moving so slowly after this </p><p>decision was taken at the highest level."  He said the GOZ </p><p>should not be placing obstacles in the way of assistance to </p><p>the people of Zimbabwe -- "that makes no sense."  He pointed </p><p>out that, if there were better communication between the </p><p>Embassy and his office, he could intervene to resolve such </p><p>problems. </p><p> </p><p>Binga </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Utete said he was not fully informed of the </p><p>situation in Binga, but mused that the lack of food </p><p>deliveries there for four weeks surely could not be </p><p>deliberate.  The Ambassador replied that food deliveries had </p><p>been suspended at Government\'s order.  Utete noted the high </p><p>degree of political polarization in Zimbabwe and said the </p><p>fact that some organizations had been involved in both food </p><p>distribution and "political" activities created a perception </p><p>problem.  WFP, he emphasized, needed to pay closer attention </p><p>to perceptions in choosing its implementing partners.  The </p><p>Ambassador said the political preferences of NGO employees </p><p>should be irrelevant so long as the NGO was doing a fair job. </p><p> Utete agreed but again stressed that perceptions matter. </p><p>After the Ambassador pressed for his help in resolving the </p><p>Binga impasse, Utete promised to look into the matter and </p><p>said he would ask when, not whether, deliveries would resume. </p><p> </p><p>Political Crisis </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Utete said the GOZ wants to reduce the country\'s </p><p>reliance on rain-fed agriculture, but said a large-scale </p><p>moved toward irrigated crops would require resources. </p><p>"That\'s where donors like the United States come in," Utete </p><p>said pointedly.  The Ambassador said Zimbabwe must first </p><p>address its comprehensive set of problems, including the </p><p>political crisis; if there is a genuine will to do so, we </p><p>would consider helping.  Asked to elaborate, the Ambassador </p><p>said the macroeconomic policies pursued by the GOZ are almost </p><p>unique and are unlikely to produce positive results.  The </p><p>political crisis is also very deep; the Ambassador said he </p><p>had lived and worked in many different countries but had </p><p>never seen an environment as polarized as that in Zimbabwe. </p><p>"Polarized," Utete acknowledged, "but not hopeless."   The </p><p>Ambassador agreed, emphasizing the need for Government to get </p><p>beyond the polarization and harness the formidable talents of </p><p>Zimbabweans on both sides of the political divide in </p><p>addressing the country\'s significant challenges.  For any </p><p>resolution of the political crisis to be sustainable, both </p><p>sides must accept the legitimacy of the other and give the </p><p>other sufficient space to operate, while the current </p><p>political environment in which the winner takes all and the </p><p>loser takes nothing has to change. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Utete replied that he could not disagree in principle </p><p>with the Ambassador\'s points.  It was important, however, to </p><p>have some historical perspective.  The American political </p><p>system is "beyond imitation," Utete said.  It took many years </p><p>to develop and the path was not easy; Americans fought a </p><p>Civil War along the way.  He thinks, sometimes, that </p><p>developed countries are too harsh in their judgments of </p><p>Zimbabwe.  He said his country was going through a process of </p><p>political and social development, and it was unfair to think </p><p>this could happen without hitches.  He emphasized that he was </p><p>"not trying to excuse anything that has happened here," but </p><p>was merely wearing his academic\'s hat.  In response, the </p><p>Ambassador said it was ultimately up to Zimbabweans to </p><p>determine the way forward.  The United States was willing to </p><p>be helpful in                 resolving the political crisis, </p><p>and the Ambassador was willing to talk at any time about any </p><p>issues to Utete or individuals he suggested.  Utete welcomed </p><p>engagement in discussions with other nations, as Zimbabweans </p><p>can learn from other experiences as they work to find a </p><p>solution of their own. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Utete is no ideologue and he does not go overboard in </p><p>parroting the party line.  He is bright and savvy, and has </p><p>lived in the United States.  His access to Mugabe gives him </p><p>significant influence within the Government, and he can be </p><p>helpful in resolving problems and in passing messages.  We </p><p>will be interested to see if his intervention helps resolve </p><p>the food impasse in Binga.  The Ambassador\'s intention in </p><p>seeking this meeting was to keep the channels of </p><p>communication open.  Utete clearly was appreciative of the </p><p>effort and seemed genuinely interested in maintaining regular </p><p>contact. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
