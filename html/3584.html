<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001949 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT WSSD; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The World Summit for Sustainable Development </p><p>      (WSSD) in South Africa has become the subject matter </p><p>      for editorials in two mainstream newspapers - the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" and the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Sunday Mirror."  Editorial </p><p>      excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Land vital for sustainable </p><p>      development" the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald" (08/26) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The WSSD which begins in South Africa today </p><p>      presents yet another platform for Zimbabwe to </p><p>      set the record straight on the land issue. . . </p><p>      For Zimbabwe the land is at the core of its </p><p>      development.  But the country\'s just struggle </p><p>      for land has been viciously attacked by some </p><p>      powerful Western nations, notably Britain and </p><p>      the United States, who want the land- </p><p>      redistributing program stopped.  As the program </p><p>      is now being wound up the American Government </p><p>      wants the government removed for correcting a </p><p>      historical injustice.  In South Africa this week </p><p>      the demonization of the government will be </p><p>      intensified with the West seeking the isolation </p><p>      of Zimbabwe.  But Zimbabwe\'s sovereignty will be </p><p>      strenuously defended, as it will be represented </p><p>      at the highest level. . .  To us sustainable </p><p>      development is impossible to achieve for as long </p><p>      as land ownership is skewed in favor of a </p><p>      minority race. . .   Zimbabwe will, therefore, </p><p>      today join the rest of the world in searching </p><p>      for ways to push forward an agenda to foster </p><p>      sustainable development. . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Earth Summit not Blair Summit" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" (08/25) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The debate in the British government on whether </p><p>      Tony Blair should boycott President Robert </p><p>      Mugabe\'s speech at the Johannesburg WSSD is an </p><p>      attempt by the Blair government to hijack a </p><p>      United Nations function and pursue the long </p><p>      drawn and well known British vendetta against </p><p>      Zimbabwe.  The Earth Summit. . .is supposed to </p><p>      focus on food production, and it is unfortunate </p><p>      that Britain is trying to politicize the summit. </p><p>      It is therefore sad to note that, at a time when </p><p>      all UN agencies that deal with food security are </p><p>      agreed that the way forward is to encourage </p><p>      rural communities to be self sufficient in food, </p><p>      Tony Blair and his government are mourning that </p><p>      Mugabe is `driving efficient farmers off highly </p><p>      productive land.\'  Whether Blair likes it or </p><p>      not, Zimbabwe has taken the first step towards </p><p>      rural development by giving the peasants land so </p><p>      that they can produce enough food to feed </p><p>      themselves.  In any case, the WSSD has no </p><p>      politics on its agenda and as the British would </p><p>      like to intimate. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
