FOREIGN MINISTERS MUASHER </p><p>AND MAHER OF JORDAN AND EGYPT WERE QUOTED AS SAYING </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT BUSH\'S POSITION REGARDING ARAFAT WOULD </p><p>NOT HANDICAP PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR GAVE </p><p>FRONT-PAGE COVERAGE TO BRITISH PRIME MINISTER\'S REMARKS </p><p>THAT MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ DOES NOT REQUIRE A </p><p>NEW UN RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p> </p><p>-- FROM DEFENSE TO ATTACK </p><p>PROMINENT JORDANIAN COLUMNIST FAHED AL-FANEK WROTE IN </p><p>SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JULY </p><p>18: "THE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE REPORTS ON JORDAN\'S </p><p>ALLEGED COLLUSION IN THE AMERICAN AGGRESSION AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ DOES NOT INDICATE THEIR TRUTH, RATHER THAT THEY </p><p>CAME FROM THE SAME SOURCE.  THIS MISINFORMATION </p><p>CAMPAIGN PUT JORDAN ON THE DEFENSIVE.  BUT NOW IS THE </p><p>TIME TO MOVE FROM DEFENSE TO OFFENSE.  THE FOREIGN </p><p>AGGRESSION BEING PLANNED AGAINST IRAQ IS NOT PLANNED </p><p>AGAINST SADDAM HUSSEIN ONLY, AS THE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT </p><p>THAT DERIVES ITS WISDOM FROM THE CIA CLAIMS.  IT IS AN </p><p>AGGRESSION AGAINST THE STATE AND PEOPLE OF IRAQ, AND </p><p>AFTER IRAQ WOULD COME THE TURN OF SYRIA, LEBANON, </p><p>SUDAN, LIBYA, YEMEN, AND SO ON.  NEUTRALITY IN THE FACE </p><p>OF THIS AGGRESSION DOES NOT FULFILL THE AMBITIONS OF </p><p>JORDAN.  WE SHOULD REJECT THE AGGRESSION IN EVERY </p><p>LEGITIMATE WAY POSSIBLE.  OTHERWISE, WHAT IS THE </p><p>MEETING OF ARAB NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE ARAB TREATIES </p><p>OF MUTUAL DEFENSE?" </p><p> </p><p>-- THE OTHER FACE OF THE QUADRIPARTITE MEETING </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST RAKAN AL-MAJALI WROTE IN CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON JULY 18: "IT IS </p><p>VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE OBJECTIVES TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL QUADRIPARTITE MEETING CONTRARY TO THOSE </p><p>THAT ARE DECLARED.  THE MEETINGS CONCENTRATED ON THE </p><p>AMERICAN CAPRICIOUSNESS AND INTRANSIGENCE REGARDING </p><p>ARAFAT, IGNORING THE SUPPOSEDLY MAIN TOPIC OF </p><p>DISCUSSION, WHICH IS TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT AND END </p><p>THE TRAGEDY IN THE OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. IT </p><p>HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT ALL PAST INITIATIVES AND PROMISES </p><p>WERE ILLUSORY, AND PRETEXTS WERE FOUND TO POSTPONE </p><p>INDEFINITELY. SIMILARLY, THE TALK ABOUT REFORMING THE </p><p>PNA AND CHANGING ARAFAT IS PART OF THE OLD SCENARIO </p><p>WHICH HAS ONE OBJECTIVE: TO CREATE ILLUSIONS THROUGH </p><p>FALSE PROMISES AND COVER UP FOR THE LACK OF ANY </p><p>INTENTION TO PROVIDE A REAL SOLUTION." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MEETINGS OF NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON </p><p>PROMINENT DAILY COLUMNIST URAIB AL-RANTAWI WROTE IN </p><p>CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON </p><p>JULY 18: "WASHINGTON FAILED TO PERSUADE THE </p><p>QUADRIPARTITE COMMITTEE TO EXILE ARAFAT, BUT IT </p><p>SUCCEEDED IN A MORE IMPORTANT PURSUIT, IMPOSING THE </p><p>AMERICAN VISION OF ADDRESSING DIFFERENT TRACKS IN </p><p>SUCCESSION, NOT IN PARALLEL.  WHEN SECURITY BECOMES THE </p><p>PREREQUISITE FOR STARTING TO FULFILL ISRAEL\'S </p><p>OBLIGATIONS, IT MEANS GIVING THE FUTURE OF THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS IN THE HAND OF A PARTY THAT REJECTS PEACE ON </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL GROUNDS. EITHER WAY, THE MEETINGS SHED SOME </p><p>LIGHT ON WHAT IS POSSIBLE INTERNATIONALLY AT THE </p><p>PRESENT STAGE, AND THIS CONSOLIDATES OUR PESSIMISTIC </p><p>ASSESSMENT THAT THE VACUUM IN THE REGION WILL CONTINUE </p><p>UNTIL NEXT SPRING AT LEAST."
