ALTHOUGH </p><p>IT APPEARS SECURITY FORCES HAVE THE SITUATION WELL </p><p>UNDER CONTROL, CONCERNS FOR THE HEALTH OF THE PATRIARCH </p><p>IS AN ISSUE THAT WON\'T JUST GO AWAY.  THE GVN COULD </p><p>SAVE ITSELF A LOT OF TROUBLE BY SIMPLY MOVING THE 83- </p><p>YEAR-OLD MONK TO HCMC, WHERE GOOD MEDICAL TREATMENT IS </p><p>AVAILABLE, BEFORE HIS HEALTH STARTS TO FAIL. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
