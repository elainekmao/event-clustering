<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001824 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR L/OES, INL/LP AND WHA/CAR </p><p>USCG WASHDC FOR LT BRAD KIESERMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KTIA, SNAR, PHSA, EWWT, EAIR, JM, NL </p><p>SUBJECT: MARITIME COUNTERNARCOTICS AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KINGSTON 1948 </p><p> </p><p>1.  With respect to reftel, Embassy\'s Global Issues </p><p>Specialist asked the Dutch Foreign Ministry\'s about the </p><p>status of the MOU, and was referred to Mr. Th. Sneek, deputy </p><p>director for international and legal matters in the Defense </p><p>Ministry.  According to Sneek, there is no such MOU being </p><p>drafted.  He explained that language about law enforcement </p><p>cooperation must be laid down in a treaty and not in an MOU, </p><p>as MOU\'s are not legally binding in the Netherlands. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Rather than drafting a separate bilateral treaty, and </p><p>thus avoid duplication, Sneek recommended using the </p><p>Caribbean regional agreement, which the Netherlands signed </p><p>in Costa Rica on April 10, 2003, as a hook-up for </p><p>U.S./Netherlands Ledet cooperation.  He said that it will be </p><p>much easier to find a formulation within the context of the </p><p>regional treaty, rather than draft a new treaty.  He also </p><p>noted that treaty ratification is a complicated and lengthy </p><p>process in the Kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Sneek, who praised U.S.-Dutch counter-narcotics </p><p>cooperation in the Caribbean, welcomed U.S. reactions to his </p><p>recommendation.  He can be reached directly at 31-70-318 </p><p>7258.  Embassy POC in this matter is Global Issues </p><p>Specialist Mieke Gronheid at 31-70-3109 269 or </p><p>gronheidmc@state.gov. </p><p> </p><p>Russel </p><p></p></div>
