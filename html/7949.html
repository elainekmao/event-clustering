<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003055 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETTC, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA DEMARCHE ON OFF CONTRACTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 2813 </p><p>     B. STATE 122029 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Acting EconCouns Bob Silverman, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Head of Department for Middle East Bilateral Economic </p><p>Affairs Akif Ayhan called in econoff together with the </p><p>British DCM May 8 to deliver the following demarche regarding </p><p>Turkey\'s pending Oil for Food (OFF) contracts.  Ayhan said he </p><p>had delivered the same demarche earlier to the Russian, </p><p>Chinese, French, and Germans (because Germany chairs the 661 </p><p>Committee) together, noting that the demarche was tailored to </p><p>what the GOT considered to be "like-minded" countries on this </p><p>issue.  Ayhan said Turkey\'s UN mission would deliver the same </p><p>points in New York in the coming days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Following is the text of the non-paper give to </p><p>econoff: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--We witness an emerging understanding in the Security </p><p>Council for a review of Iraq\'s sanctions regime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--If sanctions are suspended, phased out or removed, this </p><p>will impact on the commercial interests and commitments </p><p>emanating from the implementation of the UN Oil for Food </p><p>(OFF) Programme. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Turkey expects that the rights of the Turkish companies </p><p>will be effectively preserved in this process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Many companies belonging to various countries have several </p><p>contracts in the "pipe-line" under the OFF Programme.  An </p><p>arrangement is needed in the UN to make such contracts </p><p>operative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--We deem it crucial to take into account the following </p><p>points during the consideration of the OFF Programme at the </p><p>UN Security Council: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-All pending contracts without any exception already signed, </p><p>financed, approved or being processed within the framework of </p><p>the OFF Programme must be kept under the UN guarantee and </p><p>gradually executed.  This would be assured by a new UNSC </p><p>Resolution.  In particular, any nullification as regards the </p><p>execution of those contracts with Letters of Credit will </p><p>adversely affect the companies concerned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-The current practice on priority contracts and goods under </p><p>the UN Resolution no 1472 should be carried out in an </p><p>evenhanded manner.  In this respect, Iraq Programme Office </p><p>(OIP) and other UN agencies should make sure that the </p><p>priority criteria are applied objectively.  (The Turkish </p><p>companies\' OIP-approved contracts containing priority items </p><p>amount to 700 million US dollars of which only 73 million US </p><p>dollar worth portion is listed on the UN priority contracts.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-Deliveries to Iraqi private sector companies and to </p><p>international organizations should be subject to UN </p><p>authorization any more. Such a modification presents urgency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>      Apart from the foregoing, war reparation claims of </p><p>several companies for the losses incurred due to the Iraqi </p><p>military conflict have to be addressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment: Ayhan also said the GOT was interested in the </p><p> latest draft text on the lifting of sanctions.  Ref b </p><p>arrived after this meeting.   We will meet with Ayhan early </p><p>next week to deliver ref b points. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
