<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000890 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF; AF/S; AND DRL </p><p>PRETORIA AND GABORONE PLEASE PASS TO A/S KANSTEINER </p><p>NSC FOR SR DIR FRAZER </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SF, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICAN EMBASSY BELIEVES PROGRESS BEING MADE </p><p>TOWARD DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 883 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JGSULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (c) The Ambassador met May 8 with South African High </p><p>Commissioner Jeremiah Ndou to discuss the May 5 visit of </p><p>Presidents Mbeki, Muluzi and Obasanjo.  Ndou confirmed that </p><p>President Mugabe had accepted that the MDC court challenge of </p><p>presidential election results would not be an impediment to </p><p>dialogue.  Ndou was still working with the GOZ to clear the </p><p>remaining sticking point regarding Mugabe\'s insistence that </p><p>the MDC recognize him as the "legitimate" President.  Ndou </p><p>said that the visiting presidents had discussed this issue </p><p>with the MDC leadership and brought back to Mugabe that the </p><p>MDC accepted that he was "de facto" President and exercising </p><p>the functions of the President.  Ndou said Mugabe appeared to </p><p>be satisfied with this formulation and prepared to let </p><p>dialogue continue on that basis. As of the morning of May 8, </p><p>the South Africans were faxing back and forth to Mugabe\'s </p><p>office formulations which might allow both sides to say that </p><p>the two had agreed to begin a dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c)  Ndou said that ZANU-PF said it wanted a dialogue held </p><p>without foreign presence, but the MDC is pressing for a </p><p>foreign facilitation or presence at any dialogue. Nor has it </p><p>been determined when a dialogue would begin, although the </p><p>South Africans recognize its urgency.  Ndou said it was </p><p>possible the Presidents might return if this were necessary </p><p>to assure that the dialogue got off the ground.  Preferably, </p><p>however, this could be done by sending emissaries. </p><p> </p><p>3. (c) Ndou acknowledged that Monday\'s session had dealt only </p><p>with how to get dialogue begun and not dealt with any of the </p><p>complex issues of substance, such as Mugabe\'s retirement. </p><p>Indeed, what the dialogue should focus on had not been </p><p>addressed.  One idea would be to seek to resolve the </p><p>differences among the several different constitutions </p><p>presented in recent years as a way to assure a new </p><p>presidential election, changes in electoral procedures, etc. </p><p>Ndou said that ZANU-PF was divided on this idea.  The MDC was </p><p>concerned that its civil society supporters might oppose the </p><p>MDC acting on behalf of civil society. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
