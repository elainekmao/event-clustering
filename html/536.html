<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KADUNA 01485 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: "THE NATIONAL QUESTION": CAN NIGERIANS LIVE </p><p>TOGETHER? </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: ON AUGUST 20 THE CITIZEN WEEKLY MAGAZINE HELD </p><p>AN "ANNUAL DIALOGUE" CENTERED ON THE SUBJECT: "THE </p><p>NATIONAL QUESTION: WHAT IS THE ANSWER?"  CONSUL GENERAL </p><p>ATTENDED THE SESSION, WHICH INCLUDED SPEAKERS KEN </p><p>SARO-WIWA (ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIAN WRITERS); COL. (RTD) </p><p>YOHANNA MADAKI; FELIX ADENAIKE (FORMER MD OF THE TRIBUNE </p><p>NEWSPAPERS); DR. YUSUF BALA USMAN (ABU); SAM IKOKU, </p><p>VETERAN POLITICIAN; AND ALHAJI USMAN ABUBAKAR (FORMER </p><p>STATE COMMISSIONER AND BUSINESSMAN).  THE "NATIONAL </p><p>QUESTION," BALDLY PUT, ASKS WHETHER NIGERIANS ARE ABLE TO </p><p>LIVE TOGETHER IN ONE COUNTRY.  IN VARIOUS WAYS, THE </p><p>SPEAKERS OFFERED INSIGHTS INTO THE INTERWOVEN PROBLEMS OF </p><p>ETHNICITY, RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING </p><p>POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS.  PREDICTABLY, NO ONE HAD AN </p><p>ANSWER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE VARIOUS PRESENTATIONS, A RECURRING THEME THE </p><p>PARTICIPANTS CHEWED OVER WAS THE MULTIPLICITY OF ETHNIC </p><p>GROUPS IN NIGERIA AND THE VARIOUS WAYS, SINCE COLONIAL </p><p>TIMES, THE ISSUE HAS BEEN DEALT WITH.  WHILE SARO-WIWA, </p><p>HIMSELF AN IJAW FROM RIVERS STATE, SUPPORTED THE IDEA OF </p><p>AUTONOMY FOR EACH GROUP, FEW OTHERS SAW ANY POSITIVE GAIN </p><p>FROM FURTHER DIVISION ALONG ETHNIC LINES.  IN FACT, </p><p>SEVERAL SPEAKERS STATED EMPHATICALLY THAT THE CONTINUED </p><p>CREATION OF NEW STATES HAD ENTRENCHED ETHNIC POLITICS IN </p><p>NIGERIA AND INCREASED THE SENSE OF GRIEVANCE AMONG THOSE </p><p>MINORITIES WHICH DID NOT YET HAVE A STATE "OF THEIR OWN." </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE QUESTION OF RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY AND THE </p><p>IDENTIFICATION OF RELIGION WITH ETHNICITY ALSO CAME UP </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  ADENAIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, URGED </p><p>NIGERIANS NOT TO SHY AWAY FROM DISCUSSING ETHNIC </p><p>DIFFERENCES AS IF THEY DID NOT EXIST.  HE STATED FURTHER </p><p>HIS CONVICTION THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO FACILITATE THE </p><p>PRACTICE OF ONE\'S RELIGION WITHOUT THRUSTING THE ISSUE </p><p>INTO THE CENTER OF POLITICAL DISCUSSION.  IN SAYING THIS, </p><p>HE CAME AS CLOSE TO A DEFINITION OF SECULARISM AS WE HAVE </p><p>HEARD IN NIGERIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DR. BALA USMAN CONCENTRATED HIS LEGENDARY FIRE ON </p><p>EXPLODING SEVERAL MYTHS OR "FAIRY TALES" WHICH HE SAID </p><p>INFORMED MOST DISCUSSIONS OF THIS KIND, INCLUDING THE </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE THREE SPEAKERS WHO HAD PRECEDED HIM. </p><p>HE STATED IT WAS SILLY TO THINK OF ETHNIC GROUPS PRIOR TO </p><p>BRITISH CONQUEST OF HAVING EXISTED WITHIN CLEARLY DRAWN </p><p>POLITICAL BOUNDARIES, ONE TO EACH GROUP.  FURTHER HE </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE BRITISH TAKEOVER OF WHAT IS NOW </p><p>NIGERIA HAD BEEN GREATLY FACILITATED BY THE DIVISIONS AND </p><p>ANIMOSITIES AMONG THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND DID NOT </p><p>OCCUR SIMPLY THROUGH FORCE MAJEURE.  FINALLY, SAID BALA </p><p>USMAN, THE SIMPLISTIC DISCUSSION OF POLITICS UNDER THE </p><p>FIRST REPUBLIC IN WHICH EACH OF THE THREE REGIONS HAD HAD </p><p>ITS OWN PARTY BASED ON ITS ETHNIC GROUP WAS ALSO ABSURD. </p><p>ETHNIC SOLIDARITY HAS NEVER EXISTED IN NIGERIA, MAINTAINED </p><p>BALA USMAN, BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER THE BRITISH, NOR HAVE </p><p>POLITICAL BOUNDARIES EVER COINCIDED WITH ETHNIC BOUNDARIES </p><p>THERE IS ALSO NO SUCH THING, HE SAID, AS "RELIGIOUS </p><p>POLITICS," MAINTAINING THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST 12 </p><p>MUSLIM POLITIES IN NORTHERN NIGERIA AND NO SUCH THING AS </p><p>"THE HAUSA-FULANI."  BALA USMAN\'S CONCLUSION WAS THAT, </p><p>SINCE ALL THESE INTERPRETATIONS OF ETHNICITY ARE "FAIRY </p><p>TALES," THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE NATIONAL QUESTION IS FOR </p><p>NIGERIANS TO LIVE WITHIN ONE POLITICAL ENTITY AND WORK </p><p>OUT A WAY TO DO THIS PEACEFULLY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SAM IKOKU APPEARED TO AGREE WITH BALA USMAN ON </p><p>ESSENTIALS, STATING THAT THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION IS "HOW DO </p><p>WE LIVE TOGETHER HAPPILY?"  HE STATED THAT THE SOLUTION </p><p>CANNOT BE FOUND IN THE AMERICAN EXAMPLE (KILLING OFF THE </p><p>INDIGENOUS POPULATION) OR IN THE EUROPEAN EXAMPLE </p><p>(KILLING OFF EACH OTHER).  NEVERTHELESS, HE URGED NIGERIAN </p><p>NOT TO LOOK AT TODAY\'S SITUATION IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA </p><p>AND THE FORMER USSR, BUT RATHER IN AMERICA WHERE THE </p><p>CURRENT RESIDENTS DO LIVE TOGETHER IN HARMONY.  FOR IKOKU, </p><p>THE NIGERIAN STATE MUST ASSERT ITSELF TO GUARANTEE THE </p><p>ESSENTIAL RIGHTS OF PEOPLE OVER ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>DIVISIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO LIVE </p><p>AND WORK WHERE THEY ARE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT: TO AN AMERICAN LISTENER, THE DISCUSSION WAS </p><p>INTERESTING IN HIGHLIGHTING TWO AREAS IN WHICH NIGERIA </p><p>DIVERGES MOST SHARPLY FROM AMERICAN PRACTICE.  ONE IS WHAT </p><p>APPEARS TO US IN THE NORTHERN HEARTLAND AS A COMPLETE </p><p>INCOMPREHENSION ABOUT WHAT A SECULAR SOCIETY INVOLVES AND, </p><p>OFTEN, WHY IT MIGHT BE DESIRABLE.  THE SECOND IS WHAT </p><p>IKOKU REFERRED TO, NAMELY, AN UNDERSTANDING THAT A CITIZEN </p><p>CAN PRACTICE HIS CIVIC RIGHTS AND DUTIES WHEREVER HE </p><p>FINDS HIMSELF.  IN NORTHERN NIGERIA, AT LEAST, THE MOSLEM </p><p>HAUSA ELITE EITHER CANNOT OR WILL NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT </p><p>SECULARISM INVOLVES; IN FACT, MOST OF THEM WOULD REJECT </p><p>IT OUT OF HAND.  IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE CONSUL GENERAL </p><p>RECENTLY, ALHAJI ISA KAITA REPORTED THAT THE GOVERNOR OF </p><p>KANO HAD CONTRIBUTED TO A FUND TO REBUILD THE JNI CENTER </p><p>BURNED DOWN IN THE KADUNA MAY RIOTS.  HE WAS BLANKLY </p><p>UNCOMPREHENDING WHEN THE CG ASKED IF A LIKE AMOUNT WAS TO </p><p>BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CHURCHES DESTROYED AT THE SAME TIME. </p><p>"OH, NO," REPLIED THE VENERABLE ELDER, "ONLY THE MOSLEM </p><p>GOVERNORS ATTENDED THE MEETING." </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT (CONT):  HAD WE PRESSED THE POINT TO ISA KAITA </p><p>AND POINTED OUT THAT MANY CHRISTIANS LIVE IN KANO STATE </p><p>AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE NORTH, WE SUSPECT HE WOULD FALL </p><p>BACK ON THE POSITION MANY EXPRESSED IN THE AFTERMATH OF </p><p>THE KANO RIOTS LAST OCTOBER AND THE KADUNA TROUBLES IN </p><p>MAY:  THEY ARE "STRANGERS" WHO MAY LIVE HERE IN PEACE BUT </p><p>SHOULD NOT OVERSTEP THE "BOUNDS OF HOSPITALITY."  IN THE </p><p>ZANGON-KATAF EXAMPLE, OF COURSE, THE ARGUMENT WAS TURNED </p><p>AGAINST THE HAUSAS WHO WERE CALLED STRANGERS BY THE </p><p>KATAF.  IN NIGERIA, IT SEEMS, YOU HAVE FULL CIVIL AND </p><p>POLITICAL RIGHTS ONLY IN THAT PLACE WHERE YOU "COME FROM," </p><p>WHICH, TRANSLATED, MEANS YOUR ETHNIC GROUP OR SUB-GROUP. </p><p>IT FOLLOWS, THEN, THAT YOU MUST HAVE YOUR OWN PLACE AND, </p><p>IN MODERN PARLANCE, YOUR "OWN" STATE.  IT HAS ONLY </p><p>RECENTLY BECOME APPARENT TO THE CG THAT NIGERIANS BELIEVE </p><p>THIS PRINCIPLE UNDERLINES THE EXISTENCE OF 50 STATES IN </p><p>THE U.S. AND, THEREFORE, EXPLAINS WHY SO MANY NIGERIANS </p><p>STATE THAT SINCE THEIR SYSTEM IS  MODELED ON THE U.S., </p><p>THEY NEED TO HAVE 50 STATES AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT (CONT):  WHAT WAS REFRESHING AT THIS </p><p>CONFERENCE WAS THE DISCUSSION OF THESE ISSUES WHICH ARE </p><p>SO OFTEN SWEPT UNDER THE CARET IN NIGERIA.  THE AUDIENCE </p><p>HAD A FAIR NUMBER OF BUSINESS, ACADEMIC AND MEDIA LEADERS, </p><p>AND THE CITIZEN WILL SURELY CARRY MANY OF THE PAPERS IN </p><p>WHOLE OR PART.  SINCE MOST SPEAKERS DISAGREED WITH EACH </p><p>OTHER EVEN ON WHAT THE "NATIONAL QUESTION" IS, HOWEVER, </p><p>IT WAS NO SURPRISE THAT THEY COULD NOT COME UP WITH AN </p><p>ANSWER IN THE TIME ALLOTED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WEINLAND </p><p></p></div>
