Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Operation Focus Relief Phase III (OFR P3), </p><p>which trained three Nigerian battalions for UNAMSIL, was </p><p>successful far beyond expectations.  Strikingly different </p><p>from Phase I of the program, Phase III was successful because </p><p>of renewed diplomatic efforts, because of personnel changes </p><p>in the military coupled with reinvigorated civilian </p><p>leadership in the GON, and because of extremely professional </p><p>and dedicated Special Forces troops.  It is critical at this </p><p>positive juncture to reinforce success with additional </p><p>train-and-equip programs.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>PHASE I - PULLING TEETH </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Myriad problems plagued Phase 1 of Operation Focus </p><p>Relief in Nigeria.  While reports of the behavior and bearing </p><p>of Phase 1 troops in Sierra Leone are largely positive, </p><p>particularly when compared to previous iterations of Nigerian </p><p>peacekeeping, completing Phase 1 felt like the removal of </p><p>several teeth without novocaine.  The military, led by </p><p>Lieutenant General Malu, was uncooperative and obstructive; </p><p>false complaints of not being well-briefed and not having </p><p>approved the training and equipment package were used to </p><p>delay the program.  Tendentious news of the program leaked to </p><p>the media by Malu and his associates prompted unfavorable </p><p>editorial comment and conspiracy theories.  Pressure from </p><p>Malu on subordinate elements of the Army meant to delay or </p><p>even derail the program, for example, slowed human rights </p><p>vetting for one battalion.  This led to the loss of several </p><p>weeks of training.  It was only because the DATT literally </p><p>pulled the list of names to be vetted out of the hands of a </p><p>Division Staff Officer that vetting was completed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The April 2001 OFR roundtable meeting arranged to </p><p>resolve the outstanding issues that had led to Nigeria </p><p>slipping from Phase 2 to Phase 3 exemplified these problems. </p><p>Minister of Defense Danjuma did his best to bring agreement </p><p>between USG requirements for force protection and the purpose </p><p>of the program and LTG Malu\'s complaints, but was decidedly </p><p>unwilling to order his Chief of Army Staff to stand-down. </p><p>(COMMENT:  Due to years of military rule, real civilian </p><p>oversight of the military has been slow in developing. </p><p>President Obasanjo and Minister Danjuma strongly supported </p><p>the program, but Danjuma, and even the Chief of Defense </p><p>Staff, Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi, carefully avoided confrontation </p><p>with the Army Chief.  END COMMENT.)  Ultimately, Danjuma was </p><p>able to identify enough middle ground (on basing issues, </p><p>equipment and training) for Phase 3 to proceed in Nigeria, </p><p>but concerns remained that similar delaying tactics would </p><p>resurface.  (DATT COMMENT: In the end, Malu\'s untenable </p><p>position, that Nigerian soldiers were already trained and </p><p>superior to U.S. soldiers, was forgotten.  Training, once an </p><p>almost forbidden term, is now the term of choice for the </p><p>Nigerian Army.  They cannot get enough.  END DATT COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>PHASE 3 - WHAT WENT RIGHT </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DIPLOMACY AND CHANGES IN THE GON: The diplomatic </p><p>effort renewed with the April meeting, coupled with the </p><p>appointment of three new Ministers of State for Defense (a </p><p>Deputy Minister for each service) began the process of </p><p>putting OFR on the right track.  OFR was repeatedly at the </p><p>top of the Ambassador\'s talking points with interlocutors. </p><p>The DCM, DATT and PolMilOff had multiple meetings on OFR with </p><p>the Minister of Defense, Army Minister, Chief of Defense </p><p>Staff, Chief of Army Staff, civilian and military staff level </p><p>officers and others.  The Ambassador regularly addressed </p><p>OFR-related issues in his calls on President Obasanjo and </p><p>National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed.  Moreover, courtesy </p><p>calls on the new Chief of Air Staff and Chief of Army Staff </p><p>were used as venues to establish agreement on important </p><p>aspects of the program, such as the use of the Abuja Air Base </p><p>for the Forward Operating Base.  The Embassy\'s Public Affairs </p><p>Section set in motion a media workshop, held in Abuja in </p><p>June, that brought together nearly all of the field-grade </p><p>public relations officers of the three services and defense </p><p>correspondents.  The final exercise, led by the Embassy PAO, </p><p>focused on planning for joint public affairs work for OFR P3. </p><p> Numerous letters were sent to Embassy interlocutors, from </p><p>the President down, to ensure that discussions were recorded </p><p>and decisions noted.  Conversations were held with customs </p><p>and other logistics-focused agencies to ensure smooth </p><p>operation of the program.  This time consuming and strenuous </p><p>effort was carried out to guarantee that Phase 3 got on track </p><p>and stayed there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Danjuma\'s and Batagarawa\'s task was made significantly </p><p>easier when President Obasanjo retired the three Service </p><p>Chiefs in June 2001, including Chief of Army Staff LTG Malu. </p><p>This action was publicly described as a "normal retirement," </p><p>but it was clear that his forced retirement was, in large </p><p>part, due to Malu\'s insubordination towards the civilian </p><p>regime.  Malu\'s absence allowed for a sea change in the </p><p>bilateral military relationship.  Cooperation improved </p><p>tremendously.  Increased access to Defense Ministry players </p><p>and Army leaders allowed for better communication, and </p><p>pernicious attitudes in discussions disappeared.  The search </p><p>for solutions to obstacles overtook the search for obstacles </p><p>to solutions.  For example, no longer did the Army complain </p><p>about the training and equipment package; instead, they </p><p>reasonably suggested that Nigerian Training and Doctrine </p><p>Command participate at the three training sites, to adjust </p><p>training if necessary and to inculcate it into doctrine if </p><p>proven useful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Execution of Phase 3 quickly became a cooperative </p><p>venture between the GON, Nigerian military and USG.  The new </p><p>Chief of Army Staff, LTG Alexander Ogomudia, warmly welcomed </p><p>the 3SFG 3 Battalion Commander during his initial visit, </p><p>approved the POI, addressed concerns of his staff, and even </p><p>suggested a joint U.S.-Nigerian Army Training and Doctrine </p><p>Command (TRADOC) visit to the Phase 1 troops in Sierra Leone. </p><p> After stating he had not approved participation of one of </p><p>the three battalions selected for Phase III, he immediately </p><p>reversed course and approved their inclusion when he was </p><p>informed that camp construction had already begun. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Phase 1 also clearly sent a message to the Nigerian </p><p>soldiers that much could be gained from Operation Focus </p><p>Relief.  That message carried, and throughout OFR Phase 3, </p><p>the GON and Nigerian Army were supportive and flexible: </p><p>increasing force protection to the U.S. trainers; providing </p><p>space for a forward operating base; being responsive and </p><p>supportive of medical evacuation contingencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) While everything appeared to be moving in the right </p><p>direction on the diplomatic front, OFR Phase 3 could not have </p><p>been successful without the immense effort put forward by the </p><p>DATT and his team.  As COR for the PA&E contract, and Embassy </p><p>POC for the 3rd Battalion 3rd Special Forces Group, the DATT </p><p>oversaw base camp construction and ensured smooth air and </p><p>ground flow of equipment and personnel.  He also established </p><p>new and strong relationships with Army Operations leadership </p><p>to ensure that the necessary individuals were constantly </p><p>engaged (often a problem in Nigeria). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Public affairs coordination went smoothly between PAS </p><p>and the Director of Defense Information.  The Embassy\'s press </p><p>release on the tent camps being constructed for the program </p><p>by PA&E -- aimed at disarming the OFR P1-type rumors of a </p><p>"secret base" -- was praised by leading Nigerian newspapers </p><p>as unusually open and detailed.  After September 11, </p><p>ambitious plans for public affairs were trimmed for a few </p><p>weeks in the interest of security and caution.  In late </p><p>November, PAS organized a highly successful Nigerian "media </p><p>day" so that local journalists could observe mortar training </p><p>on the range at Kachia.  The three graduations were also open </p><p>to, and well covered by, the media.  Stories on OFR written </p><p>by Jim Fisher-Thompson of IIP\'s Washington File, were widely </p><p>run by editors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) VERY SPECIAL FORCES: Finally, we cannot say enough </p><p>about the professionalism of the 3rd Special Forces Group, </p><p>led by Colonel Mark Phelan and, here in Nigeria, 3rd </p><p>Battalion led by Lieutenant Colonel Tim Sherwood.  While the </p><p>American and Nigerian ducks were in a row for execution of </p><p>the program, Phase 3 ultimately depended on the work of the </p><p>trainers, and their success in establishing camaraderie with </p><p>the Nigerian battalions.  (No one at the graduation ceremony </p><p>in Serti, watching the Nigerian soldiers do push-ups in full </p><p>gear as a salute to the American Special Forces trainers </p><p>could doubt that strong bonds had been formed.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) LTC Sherwood\'s calm demeanor and thoughtfulness, </p><p>critical to establishing sound working relationships in this </p><p>culture, epitomized the best of leadership by example.  By </p><p>taking the time to call on state, local and traditional </p><p>leaders at each of the training sites, the Ambassador, DATT </p><p>and LTC Sherwood improved force protection for the American </p><p>soldiers.  But this effort also generated understanding and </p><p>goodwill about USG intent in having American forces on </p><p>Nigerian soil.  This effort was so well received that the </p><p>Emir of Ilorin invited the SF soldiers to visit him "anytime" </p><p>for any reason, and the Local Government Chairman in Serti </p><p>hosted a party for the trainers for which he donated a cow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Two liaison NCO\'s (LNOs) assigned to the Embassy </p><p>arrived before the start of Phase 3, and assisted the Embassy </p><p>with the administrative and logistics burdens of the program. </p><p> Moreover, becoming integral parts of the Embassy, which is a </p><p>challenging cultural experience in of itself, these two </p><p>individuals made a constant effort to assist with </p><p>Embassy-specific efforts, such as handling diplomatic </p><p>flights.  Working hand-in-hand with the DATT and others, the </p><p>LNOs played a key role in executing Phase 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Phase 3 was unfortunately marked by a Light Anti-Tank </p><p>Weapon (LAW) accident and a spate of malaria.  Military </p><p>deployments have dangers, and despite best efforts, accidents </p><p>happen.  Housing SF troops in tents, unlike the hotels of </p><p>Phase 1, increased force protection from some threats, but </p><p>made them more susceptible to malaria.  However, because of </p><p>the able SF leadership on the ground, the sick and injured </p><p>were quickly treated.  Accolades go to the Forward Surgical </p><p>Team (FST) of the 30th Medical Brigade, who not only ably </p><p>treated the 3rd Battalion personnel, but also extended </p><p>medical assistance and taught two first responder courses to </p><p>the American and British Missions.  Demonstrating why the </p><p>U.S. military is held in such high esteem, the U.S. soldiers </p><p>of OFR Phase 3 advanced USG goals tremendously. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>COMMENT: THE ROAD AHEAD </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The qualitative improvement in the capabilities of </p><p>the participating Nigerian battalions, coupled with changes </p><p>in the GON and strenuous diplomatic efforts have helped bring </p><p>about a sea change in the bilateral relationship.  The </p><p>program also substantiated that the Nigerian Army must go </p><p>through significant change before it is a viable peacekeeping </p><p>force and an integral part of Nigerian democracy (part of the </p><p>reason, no doubt, that the hubris-driven Malu objected to the </p><p>program).  OFR units have now been selected by the GON as </p><p>model units to show the international community a new side to </p><p>the generally tarnished image of the Nigerian military. </p><p>Speaking during the graduation ceremony in Ilorin on December </p><p>13, Ambassador Jeter reminded the 222 Battalion that, "Your </p><p>behavior will be used to measure the legitimacy of the </p><p>Nigerian Army.  That legitimacy will be based on your effort </p><p>to be a force for good, a force for peace, and a force for </p><p>the welfare of your people under a democratic dispensation." </p><p>Echoing his words, Minister of Defense Danjuma told the 222 </p><p>Battalion that they would be Ambassadors to Sierra Leone </p><p>representing their Army, their Government and the Nigerian </p><p>people, and were expected to act appropriately and honorably. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Because of the impact of this program, the GON and </p><p>Nigerian military are now actively seeking more OFR.  At all </p><p>three Phase 3 graduations, a mix of battalion, brigade, </p><p>division, Army HQ and political leaders publicly urged the </p><p>USG to train and equip more battalions.  President Obasanjo </p><p>has asked that five more battalions receive OFR-type </p><p>training, and the Army has indicated that they would like </p><p>additional training packages to start as soon as January 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) We are confident that the Phase 3 battalions will be </p><p>significantly better than those trained in Phase 1 (which </p><p>were a large improvement over non-OFR Nigerian battalions), </p><p>largely due to the active pursuit by the GON and Nigerian </p><p>Services of what the USG has to offer.  Similar training and </p><p>equipping for Nigerian battalions, with perhaps a longer and </p><p>more developed POI, could continue at a reasonable cost with </p><p>great additional benefit.  It is too early to determine how </p><p>long the OFR training will last with the Phase 1 and 3 </p><p>battalions, and what impact specific training, such as </p><p>training on human rights, will have on these units as they </p><p>return to Nigeria or move on to other deployments.  However, </p><p>it is clear that without continued engagement, their skills </p><p>will decay.  OFR was designed solely for the purpose of </p><p>building sub-regional capacity to deal decisively with the </p><p>RUF.  However, as a program, OFR has resulted in other </p><p>significant benefits to our bilateral relationship, and to </p><p>Nigerian governmental and military reform.  If engagement is </p><p>not maintained, a grand opportunity will be lost. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) DATT COMMENT: Planning continues to sustain OFR unit </p><p>skills through the JCET and MTT programs, although </p><p>"son-of-OFR" would be the best approach and most decisive. </p><p>Further engagement is critical.  USDAO suggests a </p><p>reconsideration of the decision not to continue with OFR. </p><p>Sustaining the capabilities of the OFR units is a </p><p>Congressional interest item, underscored on three separate </p><p>occasions by Congressional staffers who were briefed by the </p><p>DATT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) DATT COMMENT CONT: Consideration should be given to </p><p>expanding the force of two battalions and adding a command </p><p>and control element (e.g. two brigade headquarters), and a </p><p>logistical capability (e.g. a support group).  In Nigeria, </p><p>they are ready to accept any U.S. proposal.  OFR offers an </p><p>opportunity to build capacity not only for Nigeria, but for </p><p>ECOWAS as well.  There also is an important human rights </p><p>dimension to this proposal.  A well-equipped, trained and </p><p>sustained Nigerian Army is less likely to commit the </p><p>atrocities of the past.  Thus, for myriad reasons, </p><p>reinforcing success with further OFR-type train and equip </p><p>programs is a must. END DATT COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
