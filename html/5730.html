<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 000280 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, IN, NP, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: US-INDIAN COOPERATION AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>NEPAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A. 02 NEW DELHI 6938 </p><p>     B. B. NEW DELHI 267 </p><p>     C. C. NEW DELHI 641 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION ROBERT K. BOGGS. REASONS: 1.5 (B </p><p> AND D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  US security assistance to Nepal has brought </p><p>the ancillary advantage to the US of providing a new arena </p><p>for fruitful US-Indian dialogue and collaboration.  Top </p><p>Indian diplomats in Kathmandu clearly appreciate not only US </p><p>support for common US-Indian security objectives in Nepal, </p><p>but also the unprecedented frequency and candor of our </p><p>bilateral discussions of Nepal-related issues.  Indian </p><p>military intelligence officers in Kathmandu, however, are </p><p>openly and persistently uncomfortable with US sales of lethal </p><p>equipment -- and M16s in particular -- to the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army.  The following describes a recent discussion with </p><p>Indian civilian and military officers that provides some </p><p>insights into varied Indian attitudes toward US security </p><p>policy here.  Embassy Kathmandu remains convinced that US and </p><p>UK arms sales to Nepal -- although modest in quantity and </p><p>basic in technology -- have played a disproportionately </p><p>influential role in persuading Maoist leaders to agree to a </p><p>cease-fire and negotiations with the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON).  We believe our security assistance policy remains </p><p>valid, and that it offers a continuing opportunity to </p><p>reinforce growing US-Indian mil-mil cooperation and engender </p><p>greater bilateral confidence.  Positive Indian involvement </p><p>clearly is key to any longer-term resolution of Nepal\'s </p><p>political and security problems, so it is important that US </p><p>diplomacy with India accelerate along with our security </p><p>assistance to this beleaguered kingdom.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DCM and DATT met on February 4 with their Indian </p><p>counterparts to discuss issues raised by the Indian </p><p>Ambassador concerning US sales of M16 rifles to Nepal. </p><p>Indian Ambassador Shyam Saran had asked Ambassador Malinowski </p><p>several days earlier what plans the US had for providing </p><p>assault rifles to the Royal Nepal Army (RNA).  He needed to </p><p>know how many rifles the US plans eventually to provide, he </p><p>explained, because he could not justify India\'s continuing to </p><p>supply INSAS rifles if the US were planning to meet Nepal\'s </p><p>needs in this regard.  Although Ambassador Malinowski, the </p><p>DCM and our DATT meet frequently with their Indian </p><p>counterparts, and have developed unprecedented transparency </p><p>in their discussions of such formerly sensitive issues as </p><p>security assistance, this was the first time the DCM and DATT </p><p>had participated in a joint meeting at the Indian Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DCM and DATT began the discussion by explaining the </p><p>complexity of the US security assistance process, emphasizing </p><p>that none of the money appropriated in FY 02 for security </p><p>assistance for Nepal has yet been spent on any military </p><p>hardware or training.  So far, they explained, the USG has </p><p>committed only to selling the RNA -- using GON funds -- two </p><p>orders each of 5000 M16s.  The remaining 2000 rifles of the </p><p>first order (which was submitted by the RNA in May 2002) </p><p>should be delivered in the next month or two, but the </p><p>delivery date of the second 5000 is still uncertain. </p><p>Although the Nepali press persists in reporting that the US </p><p>eventually with provide 55,000 rifles, this has not been </p><p>agreed.  The DCM pointed out that the US has committed also </p><p>to providing night vision devices, pilot protective gear, and </p><p>communication equipment, but these non-lethal items have not </p><p>been manufactured yet and might take a year or two to </p><p>deliver.  In contrast, the DATT and DCM pointed out, the </p><p>Government of India (GOI) has been providing Nepal with an </p><p>accelerating stream of rifles and other military equipment. </p><p>In our view, India\'s leading role in providing military </p><p>assistance to Nepal is consistent with its proximity, long </p><p>history of assistance, and strong strategic interest in the </p><p>security of the Himalayan region.   The DCM underscored that </p><p>the US appreciates India\'s leading role, encourages it, and </p><p>has no competing long-term military objectives here. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Indian DCM, Ashok Kumar, agreed readily with the </p><p>DCM\'s characterization of the speed and volume of Indian </p><p>security assistance to Nepal.  He asserted proudly that the </p><p>more encouraging military situation on the ground in the </p><p>RNA\'s fight with the Maoists was due completely to Indian </p><p>assistance.  Kumar took pointed exception to the DATT\'s </p><p>reference to GOI "objections" to US sales of M16s to Nepal. </p><p>The GOI, he stressed, has no "objections;" it has only </p><p>"concerns."  The GOI, he explained, is meeting the RNA\'s </p><p>every request for lethal equipment.  It would thus make more </p><p>sense, he argued, for the US to let India provide arms and </p><p>concentrate instead on such equipment as night vision devices </p><p>and helicopters where the US has the comparative advantage. </p><p>If, however, the US intends to provide rifles, the GOI could </p><p>not ask Indian taxpayers to subsidize the continuing supply </p><p>to Nepal of more arms than it could effectively utilize.  The </p><p>DCM explained (again) that the sale of M16s was based on a </p><p>PACOM assessment in April 2002 of Nepal\'s most urgent </p><p>military needs.  If India is planning to fill those needs in </p><p>the near term, the USG is prepared to revise the profile of </p><p>its out-year assistance to take account of changing </p><p>requirements after we meet our current obligations.  The </p><p>Indians refused firmly to provide specific numbers on how </p><p>many INSAS rifles the GOI planned to provide.  Kumar asserted </p><p>that "numbers are not important," and that he had no interest </p><p>in getting into "a numbers game". </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The DCM and DATT countered by explaining that the USG </p><p>is not pushing M16s on the Nepali Government.  After our </p><p>current FMF appropriation was approved in mid-2002, we asked </p><p>the RNA leadership how it wanted to prioritize the use of </p><p>that money -- within the parameters set by the PACOM </p><p>assessment.  The RNA was emphatic in reiterating its request </p><p>that the lion\'s share of the appropriation be spent on M16s, </p><p>along with some non-lethal equipment and training.  The RNA </p><p>was familiar with the M16 from international peacekeeping </p><p>operations, knew it to be a reliable weapon, and felt that </p><p>its induction into RNA ranks would be a major morale-booster. </p><p> The ammunition for the M16A2, moreover, is not available in </p><p>the region and is difficult to obtain on the South Asian </p><p>black market, so M16s would be less problematic than </p><p>Indian-manufactured weapons if they were to fall into the </p><p>hands of the Maoists or Indian extremists.  The DCM and DATT </p><p>reiterated that the US has made no commitment to supplying </p><p>all the RNA\'s needs for a modern combat rifle or any other </p><p>arms.  We see our modest M16 sales only as a supplement to </p><p>the rifles being supplied by India.  With the RNA expanding </p><p>rapidly toward 70,000 soldiers, its need for rifles is </p><p>greater than either of our governments is likely to meet in </p><p>the short term.  The RNA\'s decision to standardize on a few </p><p>weapons from different sources was not unusual or </p><p>unreasonable; in fact, this is something India itself is </p><p>doing (with its purchases of specialized rifles from the US </p><p>and Israel.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The DATT asked how the GOI proposed that the USG </p><p>should approach the M16 issue with Nepal. After a pause with </p><p>no answer from the Indians, the DATT asked whether they would </p><p>want us to inform the RNA that after the current order for </p><p>M16s is filled, Nepal should turn all its arms to India? </p><p>Kumar again avoided giving a recommendation.  He was, </p><p>however, quick and categorical in rejecting the DATT\'s </p><p>proposal, stating that the Indian supply relationship should </p><p>not become a subject for US-Nepal dialogue.  Clearly, he </p><p>said, the issue of arms purchases was one the Nepal </p><p>Government would have to decide for itself.  India would have </p><p>to resolve its own assistance issues by talking directly to </p><p>the Nepalis. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In conclusion the DCM pointed out that the US values </p><p>its strengthening military-to-military relationship with </p><p>India and has no desire to complicate it with our security </p><p>assistance to Nepal.  On the contrary, our two governments </p><p>recognize our common interests in helping Nepal to defeat its </p><p>Maoist threat.  The growing frequency and candor of our </p><p>discussions of Nepal-related security issues are an important </p><p>benefit of our improved cooperation.  Nepal thus is becoming </p><p>a theater for bilateral strategic cooperation rather than of </p><p>competition.  The Indian DCM had no final comment to offer on </p><p>M16 sales and made no explicit recommendation.  He concluded </p><p>on a positive note by saying that we should continue our </p><p>dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S/NF) Comment: Our frequent discussions with our Indian </p><p>diplomatic colleagues here in Kathmandu are inconsistent in </p><p>tone.  Ambassador Shyam Saran is an unusually able </p><p>professional who is comfortable sharing his well-informed </p><p>political and security analyses of Nepal with our Ambassador </p><p>and official visitors.  We find that we agree in large </p><p>measure with his views, including his profound skepticism </p><p>about the motives of the Maoists and his emphasis on the </p><p>importance of the legal political parties supporting the </p><p>government.  Saran has raised questions about US arms </p><p>supplies to Nepal, but without complaints or threats.  DCM </p><p>Kumar, an often abrasive diplomat whose pursuit of Indian </p><p>interests borders on chauvinism, has become more collegial </p><p>and less plaintive as we have engaged him more frequently in </p><p>discussions of US security policy in Nepal.  Only Defense </p><p>Attache George Mathai, a long-time Gurkha officer, continues </p><p>to press our DATT to minimize lethal sales to Nepal, </p><p>obviously delivering prepared talking points without the </p><p>benefit of supporting information. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) On February 11 our DATT was told that the Indian </p><p>Embassy had placed a hold on the delivery of additional INSAS </p><p>rifles, although the Embassy had not informed the GON yet of </p><p>that.  According to the DATT\'s source, the GON planned </p><p>eventually to transfer the Indian-made rifles to the Nepalese </p><p>Armed Police, and the Embassy did not want them to recommend </p><p>that more rifles be diverted from Indian forces for the </p><p>subsidiary purpose. AMB Saran has confirmed this freeze on </p><p>further INSAS sales, assuring us that this step was taken not </p><p>in response to US arms sales, but because he believed the GON </p><p>was not being candid with the GOI regarding its need for and </p><p>intended use of Indian-made rifles. </p><p> </p><p>10. Conclusions we tentatively have drawn from the discussion </p><p>summarized above and numerous others like it are the </p><p>following: </p><p> </p><p>-- (C) The GOI, like the USG, is attempting to be responsive </p><p>to Nepali requests for modern combat rifles as an urgent </p><p>priority.  What is frustrating to the Indians is that the </p><p>Nepalis have never requested India to meet their complete </p><p>needs for rifles, and have indicated a preference for the M16 </p><p>as their front-line weapon.  For many reasons -- diplomatic, </p><p>economic, military and psychological -- the GOI would like </p><p>the RNA to be totally dependent on it for arms, although the </p><p>GOI is itself moving toward some foreign military sourcing </p><p>for small arms. </p><p> </p><p>-- (C) Indian analysts are increasingly persuaded that the </p><p>Maoist movement in Nepal poses a security threat to India. </p><p>Their dilemma is that they have wider and deeper interests in </p><p>a secure Nepal than any other nation, but their influence in </p><p>the Kingdom is constrained by a long history of bilateral </p><p>tension and suspicion.  Objective observers increasingly </p><p>acknowledge that US security assistance and diplomatic </p><p>support in Nepal are helpful for the realization of Indian </p><p>objectives here during this time of turmoil. </p><p> </p><p>-- (C) Indian attitudes toward US security assistance to </p><p>Nepal are complex.  On the one hand, they are pleased by the </p><p>growing transparency and collegiality of our bilateral </p><p>dialogue on Nepal.  On the other hand, some GOI elements here </p><p>apparently are having difficulty coming to terms with growing </p><p>US and UK military activism in Nepal as a conspicuous </p><p>dilution of the dominance in  military assistance that India </p><p>has long enjoyed and defended. </p><p>-- (C) Given the tensions already present in Indo-Nepal </p><p>relations, Indian diplomats here want assiduously to avoid </p><p>complicating those relations by allowing them to become </p><p>tripartite -- with the US openly becoming an interlocutor in </p><p>the shaping of the Indo-Nepal security relationship.  We </p><p>suspect that the reported decision of the GOI to hold up </p><p>INSAS deliveries is another attempt by India to remind Nepal </p><p>of the extent to which it is beholden to India without </p><p>explicitly mentioning US arms sales. </p><p> </p><p>-- (S/NF) At least in Kathmandu, Indian concern about US arms </p><p>sales to Nepal appears to vary significantly between its </p><p>civilian and military representatives.  Indian diplomats </p><p>understand the importance to India of enhanced US-Indian </p><p>defense collaboration, and do not want to jeopardize that, </p><p>and their own dialogue with us, over so small an issue. </p><p>Indian military intelligence officers, on the other hand, </p><p>appear to be more focused on traditional relations and local </p><p>military equations, and have been more willing to signal </p><p>their discomfort about our potential competition. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Comment.  The best information we have seen on Maoist </p><p>thinking indicates that the US and UK\'s announced policy of </p><p>military assistance to the GON, coupled with the first </p><p>deliveries of our M16 and British-purchased helicopters, has </p><p>been a major consideration in persuading the Maoist </p><p>leadership to opt for a cease-fire and political </p><p>negotiations.  The GON has made it clear that, despite </p><p>eventual peace talks, US steadfastness in providing military </p><p>support -- and M16s in particular -- will be an important </p><p>factor in keeping the Maoists at the negotiating table. </p><p>Obviously, the positive exercise of Indian military aid and </p><p>political influence is absolutely key to a final resolution </p><p>of Nepal\'s complex political and security problems.  Embassy </p><p>applauds efforts in New Delhi and Washington (see, for </p><p>example, Delhi\'s useful cable, reftel) to strengthen our </p><p>constructive dialogue with India on Nepal, and intends to </p><p>redouble our efforts here to build on our new strategic </p><p>relationship with India as we press forward with our arms </p><p>assistance to Nepal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
