BURGHARDT, </p><p>AMBASSADOR; REASON 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY:  THE COMPLEX AND EVOLVING </p><p>INTERRELATIONS BETWEEN RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>VIETNAM CAME TO LIGHT IN UNOFFICIAL MEETINGS BETWEEN A </p><p>DELEGATION FROM THE U.S. COMMISSION FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM (USCIRF) AND TWO HANOI RELIGIOUS </p><p>FIGURES.  WHILE INDIVIDUAL CONGREGATIONS OF THE </p><p>OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED HANOI-BASED EVANGELICAL CHURCH </p><p>OF VIETNAM (ECVN) OPERATE WITH FEW RESTRICTIONS, THE </p><p>GVN HAS NOT PERMITTED THE ECVN\'S LEADERSHIP TO MEET </p><p>SINCE 1988.  THE GVN SEEMS TO REGARD THE ACTING </p><p>CHAIRMAN WITH SOME SUSPICION AND WILL NOT RECOGNIZE </p><p>ANY LEADERSHIP CHANGES.  MEANWHILE, THE MONKS AT </p><p>HANOI\'S HISTORIC ONE PILLAR PAGODA ARE THE FOCUS OF A </p><p>COMPLICATED STRUGGLE PRIMARILY INVOLVING FACTIONS OF </p><p>THE RECOGNIZED BUDDHIST CHURCH AND THE LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THIS STRUGGLE HAS DRAWN IN THE DOMESTIC </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL PRESS, AND A PROMINENT DEMOCRACY </p><p>ACTIVIST.  REFTELS REPORT ON THE USCIRF DELEGATION\'S </p><p>OTHER MEETINGS IN HANOI AND HO CHI MINH CITY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ON FEBRUARY 22, USCIRF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR </p><p>STEVEN MCFARLAND AND ANALYST JOHN TAI, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>EMBOFFS, MET PASTOR AU QUANG VINH OF THE ECVN AT THE </p><p>PROTESTANT CHURCH IN HANOI.  PASTOR VINH SAID THAT HE </p><p>WAS THE ACTING CHAIRMAN OF THE ECVN, BUT THAT SINCE </p><p>HIS STATUS HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE GVN HE WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00559  01 OF 03  120747Z </p><p>SPEAKING TO THE DELEGATION IN HIS ROLE AS THE PASTOR </p><p>OF THE ECVN CONGREGATION IN HANOI.  PASTOR VINH STATED </p><p>THAT HIS FELLOW PASTORS IN THE ECVN REQUESTED THAT HE </p><p>BECOME ACTING-CHAIRMAN OF THE ECVN MANAGEMENT COUNCIL </p><p>AFTER THE DEATH OF THE INCUMBENT IN 1999.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT THE GVN HAS NOT ALLOWED THE COUNCIL TO MEET SINCE </p><p>1988, DESPITE ANNUAL ECVN REQUESTS.  HE SAID THAT THE </p><p>GVN NEVER GAVE A REASON FOR DENYING PERMISSION TO </p><p>MEET.  DUE TO HIS UNOFFICIAL STATUS PASTOR VINH </p><p>CLAIMED THE GVN SUBJECTED HIM TO ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY </p><p>AND QUESTIONING.  HE SAID THAT THE GVN HAD LABELED HIM </p><p>A "REACTIONARY" ELEMENT IN THE EARLY 1990\'S AFTER HE </p><p>HELPED PUBLISH A HMONG LANGUAGE BIBLE WITHOUT </p><p>AUTHORIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  PASTOR VINH DESCRIBED THE ECVN\'S ORGANIZATION </p><p>IN 14 CONGREGATIONS SCATTERED AROUND NORTHERN VIETNAM. </p><p>THERE ARE THREE IN HAIPHONG AND EIGHT IN OTHER </p><p>NORTHERN TOWNS AND CITIES.  THE 14 GOVERNMENT </p><p>RECOGNIZED CONGREGATIONS ALSO INCLUDE THREE GROUPS OF </p><p>ETHNIC HMONG AND GIAY IN NORTHWESTERN PROVINCES.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT THREE OF THESE GROUPS DO NOT HAVE PASTORS </p><p>OR CHURCH BUILDINGS, BUT THAT THEY HAVE SOME LAY </p><p>LEADERS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT WHILE THE GVN HAS NOT </p><p>ALLOWED THE ECVN TO OPERATE A TRAINING FACILITY SINCE </p><p>1993, HE TRAINS PASTORS ANYWAY, IN SECRET.  PASTOR </p><p>VINH SAID THAT THE ETHNIC KINH CONGREGATIONS AVERAGE </p><p>ABOUT 1000 MEMBERS AND THAT THE MINORITY CONGREGATIONS </p><p>ARE CONSIDERABLY LARGER.  HIS OWN CONGREGATION IN </p><p>HANOI NUMBERS ABOUT 800, MOSTLY YOUNG PEOPLE.  BY </p><p>CONTRAST, A FEW YEARS AGO, IT WAS A RELATIVELY OLD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00559  01 OF 03  120747Z </p><p>GROUP AND ONLY NUMBERED ABOUT 150. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  DESPITE THE PROBLEMS FACED BY THE ECVN, </p><p>PASTOR VINH SAID THAT HE FELT THE OVERALL SITUATION </p><p>FOR RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS IN VIETNAM IS CONSIDERABLY </p><p>BETTER THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO.  IN RESPONSE TO A </p><p>QUESTION FROM MCFARLAND, PASTOR VINH VOICED DOUBT THAT </p><p>U.S. SANCTIONS WOULD HAVE A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN VIETNAM.  HE SAID THAT HE THOUGHT </p><p>DIALOGUE HAD BROUGHT GOOD RESULTS SO FAR AND EXPRESSED </p><p>FAITH THAT THE SITUATION WOULD CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. </p><p>HE ALSO NOTED THE IRONY THAT SEEMING GVN DISAPPROVAL </p><p>OF THE PROTESTANT CHURCH APPEARED TO BOTH ATTRACT THE </p><p>CURIOUS AND STRENGTHEN THE FAITH OF BELIEVERS.  (NOTE: </p><p>POLOFF WAS NOT PRESENT DURING THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION </p><p>BETWEEN PASTOR VINH AND THE USCIRF DELEGATION.  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  ON FEBRUARY 21, THE ENTIRE DELEGATION </p><p>INCLUDING COMMISSIONER FIRUZ KAZEMZADEH, STEVEN </p><p>MCFARLAND, AND JOHN TAI, ACCOMPANIED BY EMBOFFS, </p><p>VISITED ONE PILLAR PAGODA AND ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THE </p><p>ABBOT.

AFTER INTRODUCTIONS, </p><p>MCFARLAND ASKED THICH TAM KIEN ABOUT REPORTS THAT THE </p><p>GVN WAS TRYING TO REPLACE THE PAGODA\'S ABBOT.  THE </p><p>MONK REPLIED THAT THIS WAS TRUE AND THAT THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES WERE TRYING TO REMOVE HIM AS WELL.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN THE ONLY STUDENT OF THE FORMER </p><p>ABBOT, WHO DIED IN JULY 1996.  THE NEW ABBOT HAD </p><p>ADOPTED HIM AS HIS STUDENT, BUT THE ABBOT\'S </p><p>ASSIGNMENT TO ONE PILLAR PAGODA WAS TECHNICALLY </p><p>"TEMPORARY" AND HE WAS ALSO THE ABBOT OF ANOTHER HANOI </p><p>PAGODA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THICH TAM KIEN SAID THAT EFFORTS TO REPLACE </p><p>THE TWO MONKS AT ONE PILLAR PAGODA REPRESENTED NOT </p><p>ONLY A STRUGGLE BETWEEN DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL BUDDHIST SANGHA (CBS--THE OFFICIALLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED BUDDHIST ORGANIZATION), BUT AN EFFORT OF </p><p>THE BA DINH DISTRICT (A SUBDIVISION OF HANOI) </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE PAGODA.  THICH TAM </p><p>KIEN CITED "DECISION LETTER 927 OF THE BA DINH </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE" DATED JULY 27, 1999 IN WHICH THE </p><p>LOCAL AUTHORITIES ASKED THE ABBOT TO LEAVE ONE PILLAR </p><p>PAGODA ON THE GROUNDS OF HIS AGE AND RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR TWO PAGODAS.  THICH TAM KIEN CLAIMED THAT THE CBS </p><p>AND BA DINH DISTRICT WISHED TO ASSIGN THICH THANH </p><p>PHUC, WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS THE CHIEF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN THE DISTRICT AND AS SOMEONE CLOSE TO </p><p>LOCAL AUTHORITIES, TO ONE PILLAR PAGODA.  IN ANSWER TO </p><p>A QUESTION FROM MCFARLAND, THICH TAM KIEN SAID THAT </p><p>THE DISTRICT AUTHORITIES HAD NO ROLE IN DECIDING WHO </p><p>THE ABBOT SHOULD BE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00559  02 OF 03  120747Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THICH TAM KIEN SAID THAT HE WROTE A LETTER </p><p>FOR HIS NEW MASTER REFUSING THE DISTRICT\'S REQUEST </p><p>THAT THE ABBOT LEAVE.  HE SAID THAT THE CENTRAL GROUP </p><p>WITHIN THE CBS WANTED TOTAL CONTROL OF THE PAGODA, SO </p><p>THEY DEMOTED HIM AND STRIPPED HIM OF HIS RANK ON THE </p><p>GROUNDS OF AN UNSPECIFIED VIOLATION OF BUDDHIST </p><p>MORALS.  THICH TAM KIEN SAID THAT HE WENT TO HIS </p><p>ORIGINAL MASTER IN HO CHI MINH CITY WHO ADVISED HIM TO </p><p>FILE A WRITTEN COMPLAINT WITH THE BOARD THAT TOOK </p><p>ACTION AGAINST HIM ASKING THEM FOR PROOF OF THE CHARGE </p><p>AND TO RE-INSTATE HIM IF THEY WOULD NOT.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>THERE HAD BEEN NO OFFICIAL ACTION SINCE THEN AND THAT </p><p>HE KEPT HIS TITLE AND RANK. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ON APRIL 30, 2000, THICH TAM KIEN CLAIMED HE </p><p>RECEIVED A LETTER FROM "LOCAL AUTHORITIES" STATING </p><p>THAT IF HE DID NOT LEAVE, THEY WOULD ASK "OTHER </p><p>FORCES" TO PHYSICALLY REMOVE HIM FROM ONE PILLAR </p><p>PAGODA.  HE SAID THAT THE LETTER ONLY MENTIONED HIM </p><p>NOT HIS MASTER.  HE SPECULATED THAT THE LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES DID NOT WANT TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE </p><p>ABBOT BECAUSE THEY FEARED HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLAINTS, </p><p>NOTING THAT THE ABBOT HAD A NETWORK OF CONTACTS IN THE </p><p>U.S. AND FRANCE.  NOW HE WAS BEGINNING TO INHERIT THIS </p><p>NETWORK FROM HIS MASTER, HE SAID.  NONETHELESS, THICH </p><p>TAM KIEN CLAIMED THAT THE VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>DISTRICT THREATENED HIM WITH PHYSICAL HARM IF HE DID </p><p>NOT RESIGN.  HE RECOUNTED THAT THE THREAT GOT OUT ON </p><p>THE INTERNET AND WAS PICKED UP BY THE BBC, PROMPTING </p><p>THE DISTRICT CHAIRMAN TO MEET WITH JOURNALISTS TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00559  02 OF 03  120747Z </p><p>"CLARIFY" THE SITUATION.  CONSEQUENTLY, HE SAID THAT </p><p>NOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES COULD NOT MOVE THEM BECAUSE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.  ASIDE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SUPPORT THE TWO MONKS HAVE RECEIVED, THICH TAM KIEN </p><p>CLAIMED THAT HIGH-RANKING MONKS IN HO CHI MINH CITY, </p><p>INCLUDING HIS ORIGINAL MASTER, ARE ON THEIR SIDE. </p><p>MOREOVER, HE SAID THAT TUOI TRE NEWSPAPER, THE </p><p>OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE HO CHI MINH CITY YOUTH LEAGUE, </p><p>HAD ADVOCATED THEIR CAUSE.  FINALLY HE ADDED THAT </p><p>DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST PHAM QUE DUONG HAD INTERVENED IN </p><p>SOME WAY, CLAIMING THAT DUONG HAD ALSO HELPED STOP </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF THE PAGODA SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO MAKE </p><p>MORE ROOM FOR THE NEARBY MUSEUM DEDICATED TO HO CHI </p><p>MINH. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  THICH TAM KIEN CONCLUDED BY ASKING THE </p><p>USCIRF DELEGATION TO TAKE UP THREE POINTS WITH THE GVN </p><p>ON BEHALF OF HIS MASTER AND HIM: </p><p>-- TO "ABOLISH THE ILLEGAL ORDINANCE AND DECISION OF </p><p>BA DINH DISTRICT" ABOUT THE PAGODA </p><p>-- TO REQUEST THAT HIS MASTER BE APPOINTED THE </p><p>PERMANENT ABBOT OF ONE PILLAR PAGODA </p><p>-- TO OFFICIALLY TRANSFER HIS RESIDENCE REGISTRATION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3821 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00559  03 OF 03  120747Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      ED-01    OIGO-00  E-00     HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PC-01    PRS-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------72F139  120747Z /38 </p><p>P 120722Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5748 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HANOI 000559 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/RF </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS TO USCIRF </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR ABLAGG </p><p> </p><p>AND OFFICIAL RELIGIOUS REGISTRATION TO ONE PILLAR </p><p>PAGODA. </p><p>THE DELEGATION MADE NO REPLY TO THICH TAM KIEN\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00559  03 OF 03  120747Z </p><p>REQUEST.

(C)  COMMENT:  PASTOR VINH HAS EXPRESSED </p><p>RELUCTANCE TO MEET WITH EMBOFFS IN THE PAST, CITING </p><p>PROBLEMS HE HAS WITH THE POLICE.  WHILE HE POINTED OUT </p><p>A NUMBER OF THE ECVN\'S PROBLEMS, MOST NOTABLY ITS </p><p>INABILITY TO MAKE OFFICIAL DECISIONS SINCE 1988, HIS </p><p>OVERALL APPRAISAL WAS CLEARLY POSITIVE.  THICH TAM </p><p>KIEN\'S ACCOUNT GAVE AN UNEXPECTED GLIMPSE INTO THE </p><p>COMPLEXITY OF THE CBS\'S INTERNAL MACHINATIONS AND </p><p>INTERACTIONS WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  THICH THANH TU\'S </p><p>SUCCINCT, "HE IS STILL THERE," MAY INDICATE A DE FACTO </p><p>CBS DECISION TO LEAVE THE ABBOT WHERE HE IS.  PARTS OF </p><p>THICH TAM KIEN\'S STORY ARE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY AND IT </p><p>IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO KNOW HIS ENTIRE AGENDA, AS </p><p>COMMISSIONER KAZEMZADEH POINTED OUT.  DURING THE YOUNG </p><p>MONK\'S CONVERSATION WITH THE DELEGATION HE APPEARED TO </p><p>DECIDE TO GIVE THE DELEGATION MORE AND MORE DETAIL, </p><p>REPEATING SOME OF HIS EARLIER POINTS IN MORE DEPTH. </p><p>HIS MENTION OF PHAM QUE DUONG\'S ASSISTANCE AND HIS </p><p>UNSOLICITED CITATION OF DUONG\'S ADDRESS AND CELL PHONE </p><p>NUMBER WAS SURPRISING.
