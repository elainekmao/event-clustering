SUMMARY.  THE ROKG VIEWS ITSELF AS A POTENTIAL TARGET </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SHARES A STRONG POLICY </p><p>AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM WITH THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN </p><p>1992, AND NO ROKG PROSECUTIONS OR EXTRADITIONS INVOLVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE POLICE IN KOREA CONSIDER </p><p>RECURRING INCIDENTS OF STUDENT VIOLENCE TO BE CRIMINAL </p><p>ACTS AND NOT TERRORIST EVENTS.  THERE HAS BEEN NO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ROKG ATTITUDES TOWARD INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM SINCE 1991, BUT THE ROKG HAS FAILED </p><p>TO REDUCE THE LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN KOREA, AS </p><p>STIPULATED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 748.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ROK AS A TARGET OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>2.  THE ROKG SHARES USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORIST THREAT, AND OUR POLICIES ON TERRORISM AND </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ARE GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT.  AS </p><p>RECENTLY AS 1987, THE ROK WAS THE VICTIM OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM SPONSORED BY NORTH KOREA WHICH RESULTED IN THE </p><p>DEATHS OF 115 PASSENGERS ABOARD KAL FLIGHT 858.  THE </p><p>SELF-CONFESSED SABOTEUR OF KAL FLIGHT 858 WAS TRIED AND </p><p>SENTENCED TO DEATH, BUT RECEIVED A PRESIDENTIAL PARDON IN </p><p>1990 AFTER COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE ROK AND IMPLICATING </p><p>NORTH KOREA IN THE BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM </p><p>IN 1992, AND NO ROKG PROSECUTIONS OR EXTRADITIONS </p><p>INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THERE HAS BEEN NO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ROKG ATTITUDES TOWARD INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM SINCE 1991. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE POLICE IN KOREA CONSIDER RECURRING INCIDENTS OF </p><p>STUDENT VIOLENCE TO BE CRIMINAL ACTS AND NOT TERRORIST </p><p>EVENTS.  THE ROKG REACTS VIGOROUSLY TO OCCASIONAL ACTS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT USG FACILITIES IN KOREA WHICH PROVIDE </p><p>CONVENIENT TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENT PROTESTERS. </p><p>THE INFLUENCE OF THE RADICAL STUDENT MOVEMENT IN KOREA IS </p><p>DIMINISHING WITH PROGRESS TOWARD DEMOCRATIZATION.  YET </p><p>STUDENTS CONTINUED TO STAGE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS DURING </p><p>1992, USING FIREBOMBS, FOR EXAMPLE, AGAINST THE USIS </p><p>LIBRARY IN DOWNTOWN SEOUL ON APRIL 19 AND AGAINST RIOT </p><p>POLICE IN DEMONSTRATIONS IN SEOUL, INCHON, AND KWANGJU ON </p><p>AUGUST 11. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ROKG SECURITY AGENCIES CONTINUE TO BE ALERT TO </p><p>POSSIBLE TERRORIST THREATS TO U.S. EMBASSY PERSONNEL AND </p><p>INSTALLATIONS.  THE USG AND ROKG ROUTINELY SHARE </p><p>INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL TERRORIST THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>A STRONG POLICY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>6.  THE ROKG HAS A STRONG POLICY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM BORNE OF ITS CONCERN OVER NORTH KOREAN TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS.  ON MAY 22, 1992 THREE ARMED NORTH KOREAN </p><p>INFILTRATORS WERE INTERCEPTED AND KILLED BY SOUTH KOREAN </p><p>SOLDIERS APPROXIMATELY ONE KILOMETER SOUTH OF THE MDL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA SIMULTANEOUSLY JOINED THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS AS FULL MEMBERS IN OCTOBER 1991.  THE ROKG, WHILE </p><p>DECLARING SUPPORT FOR UN SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA, HAS </p><p>TAKEN NO STEPS TO REDUCE THE LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN </p><p>THE ROK, AS STIPULATED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 748.  MOFA </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE SEVERAL TIMES SAID (SEE REF B) THAT THE </p><p>ROKG WAS "SERIOUSLY EXAMINING" HOW TO COMPLY WITH THIS </p><p>PART OF UNSCR 748 BUT THAT NO DECISIONS HAD BEEN MADE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE ROKG HAS NOT AND DOES NOT SUPPORT STATE TERRORISM </p><p>AND DOES NOT PROVIDE DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, FINANCIAL OR </p><p>OTHER SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE ROKG HAS </p><p>NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTED COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>GREGG </p><p></p></div>
