<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 109428 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PROP, OPRC, LY, EI </p><p>SUBJECT:  WHITE PAPERS ON LIBYA POUCHED TO POST </p><p> </p><p>REF: DUBLIN 1811 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL, ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DEPARTMENT POUCHED TO POST APRIL 7 COPIES OF TWO </p><p>UNCLASSIFIED DEPARTMENT WHITE PAPERS WHICH OFFER FURTHER </p><p>INFORMATION ON LIBYAN COMPLICITY IN 1985 ROME AND VIENNA </p><p>AIRPORT ATTACKS AND 1986 LABELLE BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE IMPLICATING LIBYA IN THE LABELLE </p><p>BOMBING HAS EMERGED IN THE CONTEXT OF INVESTIGATIONS </p><p>INTO STASI FILES IN FORMER EAST GERMANY.  THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION INTO THE BOMBING IS AN ONGOING LEGAL </p><p>CASE.  NO SUSPECTS ARE CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY.  ONE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL, THE ONLY SURVIVOR OF THE ROME AIRPORT </p><p>ATTACK, IS CURRENTLY SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE IN ITALY. </p><p>THE TWO SURVIVORS OF THE VIENNA AIRPORT ATTACK ARE </p><p>SERVING LIFE SENTENCES IN AUSTRIA.  INFO ADDRESSEES MAY </p><p>WISH TO ADD VIEWS OF LOCAL INTERIOR OR JUSTICE MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WE AGREE WITH EMBASSY THAT IRISH TIMES STATEMENTS </p><p>ARE DAMAGING AND SHOULD NOT BE LEFT UNCHALLENGED.  WE </p><p>SUGGEST POST ADVISE PAPER IN WHATEVER MANNER POST DEEMS </p><p>MOST APPROPRIATE THAT LIBYA WAS INDEED DIRECTLY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 1986 LABELLE DISCO BOMBING IN </p><p>BERLIN.  FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT HAS BECOME AVAILABLE IN </p><p>THE FILES OF THE FORMER GDR\'S SECURITY SERVICES FULLY </p><p>CORROBORATES THE ORIGINAL ACCUSATION.  THE ABU NIDAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION CARRIED OUT THE 1985 ROME AND VIENNA </p><p>AIRPORT ATTACKS WITH VITAL MATERIAL ASSISTANCE FROM </p><p>LIBYA.  IN NO WAY IS IT ACCURATE TO SAY THAT LIBYA HAS </p><p>BEEN EXONERATED, BY GERMAN AND ITALIAN POLICE OR BY ANY </p><p>COMPETENT AUTHORITY.   DEPARTMENT SUGGESTS POST QUERY </p><p>THE NEWSPAPER ON SOURCES FOR THE ASSERTIONS DESCRIBED IN </p><p>REFTEL.  BECAUSE LIBYAN COMPLICITY IN THESE ATTACKS IS </p><p>CONSIDERED A GIVEN BY TREVI GROUP INTELLIGENCE AND LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS GENERALLY, INCLUDING IRISH </p><p>MEMBERS, WE SUSPECT LIBYA WILL PROVE THE SOURCE OF THE </p><p>DISINFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>BAKER </p><p></p></div>
