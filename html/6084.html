<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000589 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MOPS, IZ, CA, UNSC, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN POLITICAL DIRECTOR ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Foreign Affairs Political Director Jim Wright </p><p>told us that the Canadian proposal at the UNSC is not an </p><p>attempt to mediate, but a set of ideas that might help the </p><p>Council focus again on disarmament rather than on internal </p><p>divisions.  Wright appealed for USG public statements to keep </p><p>the focus on Iraqi disarmament rather than on regime change. </p><p>As for a potential Canadian contribution to a military </p><p>campaign against Iraq, Wright said the Canadian policy </p><p>remains unchanged - yes if action is endorsed by the Security </p><p>Council, "to be determined" if not.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Political Minister Counselor and PolMilOff met with </p><p>Foreign Affairs Political Director Jim Wright on March 3 to </p><p>discuss Iraq.  Wright was defensive about the Canadian </p><p>non-paper at the UNSC on "Bridging the Divide."  He confirmed </p><p>that Canadian PermRep Heinbecker would be meeting that </p><p>afternoon with the 10 non-permanent members of the UNSC </p><p>(E-10), who had asked for an explanation of Canada\'s ideas. </p><p>Wright said this meeting was completely at the E-10\'s </p><p>initiative, and that Heinbecker would be in receive mode. </p><p>The E-10, Wright continued, are frustrated that the P-5 are </p><p>unwilling to budge from their positions and are putting the </p><p>onus on the E-10. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Wright said that PM Chretien has been in contact with </p><p>Presidents Fox of Mexico (whom he visited last week) and </p><p>Lagos of Chile, both of whom are "intrigued" by the Canadian </p><p>ideas.  He noted that popular opinion was overwhelmingly </p><p>against war in both Mexico and Chile.   Wright said that he </p><p>and other GoC officials have also been in frequent contact </p><p>with France/Germany/Russia about their proposal, and have </p><p>told them it is a non-starter because of being open-ended. </p><p>Wright underscored that the Canadian position is very </p><p>different, as expressed by Heinbecker in his remarks to the </p><p>recent UNSC open meeting.  Canada wants the Security Council </p><p>to consider the full range of options, but the Council needs </p><p>to act quickly. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Wright also raised the February 28 White House </p><p>statement that U.S. goals in Iraq included both disarmament </p><p>and regime change.  He noted that Prime Minister Chretien, </p><p>speaking in Mexico City immediately after the White House </p><p>statement, had been asked by a reporter about regime change </p><p>being a U.S. goal in Iraq.  Chretien responded that this was </p><p>a dangerous concept, and that "if you start changing regimes, </p><p>where do you stop?"  Wright said that Chretien had been put </p><p>in an awkward position, but that talk of regime change would </p><p>not be helpful in the Security Council, and urged us to keep </p><p>the focus on disarmament.  Wright praised a speech by </p><p>Ambassador Cellucci and an interview with Deputy Secretary </p><p>Armitage, both televised by the CBC on February 28, as </p><p>hitting all the right notes on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On Canadian military participation in Iraq, Wright </p><p>said the GoC position has been consistent throughout.  Canada </p><p>has supported U.S. efforts to bring pressure to bear on Iraq, </p><p>but it also wants the UNSC to live up to its unique </p><p>responsibilities.  For Canada to now say that it would </p><p>participate militarily, on the eve of a potential UN </p><p>decision, would be very odd.  Wright urged us to be patient, </p><p>and said that the GoC would quickly make its decision once </p><p>the Council has acted. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: The GoC is relishing its chance to encourage </p><p>consensus at the UNSC, however unlikely that might be. </p><p>Canada has heard our message, from President Bush on down, </p><p>that its proposal is too little, too late.  But </p><p>multilateralism is an article of faith in Ottawa, and the GoC </p><p>believes it is defending the authority of the United Nations. </p><p> So long as Security Council members are willing to listen, </p><p>Canada will continue trying to "bridge the divide." </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
