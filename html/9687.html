<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 OTTAWA 002129 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE, NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "Bush\'s 16 words" </p><p>The conservative National Post opined (7/22): "...As </p><p>things stand, the pro-and anti-Bush camps sit at a sort </p><p>of stalemate, both sides waiting for the leak that will </p><p>definitively vindicate their version of events. But it </p><p>is more likely the brouhaha will end with an </p><p>inconclusive anticlimax, one whose ultimate effect is </p><p>to vindicate the President. Far from being a scandal </p><p>\'worse than Watergate,\' or an effort to deliberately </p><p>\'mislead\' the public, the State of the Union glitch </p><p>seems to have resulted in large part from the interplay </p><p>between an overzealous, but well-intentioned, White </p><p>House staffer and an insufficiently assertive, but </p><p>equally well-intentioned, CIA analyst.... [T]here is </p><p>every reason to expect the false scandal surrounding </p><p>Mr. Bush\'s January speech will subside. Enemies of the </p><p>President may find an </p><p>issue to bring him down in the 2004 election. But it </p><p>won\'t be this one." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "The tragic cost of a rash Iraq war" </p><p>The liberal Toronto Star editorialized (7/22): "British </p><p>scientist David Kelly should be alive today. But like </p><p>thousands of others, he has become a casualty of the </p><p>American/British rush to make war on Iraq.... Blair has </p><p>ordered a judicial probe of this tragedy, seeking to </p><p>absolve his government of blame. But he already has </p><p>lost the public\'s confidence.... In Washington, U.S. </p><p>President George Bush is also under siege for </p><p>exaggerating Saddam\'s nuclear ambitions to justify war. </p><p>His support is fading. There is a savage </p><p>irony in this postwar blame game. Tragic as his death </p><p>is, Kelly is just one victim of Bush\'s obsession with </p><p>\'regime change\' in Baghdad, and Blair\'s eager </p><p>compliance. Some 275 American and British troops have </p><p>also died, along with more than 8,500 Iraqi civilians </p><p>and military. They are the other casualties in Bush\'s </p><p>drive to \'save\' the world from weapons of mass </p><p>destruction that Washington has yet to produce. The </p><p>American taxpayer, meanwhile, is on the hook for more </p><p>than $60 billion for the war and $1 billion a week </p><p>since.... This is a mess, and a fearsome price for a </p><p>war that U.N. inspectors cautioned against from the </p><p>start. They loathed Saddam\'s vicious regime. But they </p><p>believed, rightly, that sanctions were working. That </p><p>Baghdad was contained. That there was no need to rush </p><p>to war. They were right." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "Through the fog of war" </p><p>Contributing foreign editor Eric Margolis observed in </p><p>the conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (7/20): "...As the </p><p>furor in Washington grows over Bush\'s admission of now- </p><p>discredited claims about Iraqi uranium imports from </p><p>Africa in his keynote state of the union address, </p><p>administration officials are viciously blaming one </p><p>another... Blame rightly belongs to Bush himself, and </p><p>to his woefully inadequate national security adviser, </p><p>Condoleezza Rice. Either they knew the uranium story </p><p>was false, or they were unfit for high office. For one </p><p>thing, uranium ore is no more threatening than cake </p><p>mix.... Bush\'s crusade against Iraq was designed to </p><p>assuage Americans\' fury and fear over 9/11 by making </p><p>Saddam Hussein a whipping boy for the attack in which </p><p>he had no part. The jolly little wars against </p><p>Afghanistan and Iraq were also designed to make </p><p>Americans forget the Bush White House had been caught </p><p>with its pants down by 9/11, and was asleep at the </p><p>switch in the Enron financial disaster. Who now </p><p>remembers that Attorney General John Ashcroft actually </p><p>cut spending on anti-terrorism before 9/11, or that </p><p>Washington was giving millions to the Taliban until </p><p>four months before 9/11? How better to get Americans to </p><p>support a war than by insinuating, as did Bush, that </p><p>Iraq was responsible for 9/11, and claiming Saddam was </p><p>about to attack the U.S. with weapons of mass </p><p>destruction? A pre-emptive attack on Iraq was urgent to </p><p>save America, insisted Bush. A weak-kneed Congress and </p><p>credulous public went along with White House </p><p>warmongering, while the spineless UN secretary </p><p>general, Kofi Annan, and UN arms inspector Hans Blix </p><p>wriggled like jellyfish. Most Democrats, including some </p><p>presidential candidates, joined Bush\'s lynch mob.... A </p><p>torrent of lies poured from the administration, all </p><p>aimed at justifying a war of aggression, thwarting the </p><p>UN Security Council, </p><p>ending UN inspections in Iraq and grabbing Iraq\'s oil </p><p>riches. Virtually all administration claims about </p><p>Iraq\'s weapons had been disproved by UN inspectors </p><p>before Bush went to war.... And the biggest canard of </p><p>all: Bush\'s absurd claims there was \'no doubt that the </p><p>Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of </p><p>the most lethal weapons ever devised,\' and that it </p><p>\'threatened all mankind.\' Thanks to the shameful </p><p>complicity of the U.S. media, which amplified White </p><p>House propaganda, Americans were led to believe </p><p>Iraq attacked the U.S. on 9/11, and was in league with </p><p>al-Qaida. Bush\'s faux war on terrorism was redirected, </p><p>by clever White House spin, into a hugely popular </p><p>campaign against Iraq. The failure to kill terrorist </p><p>leader Osama bin Laden was covered up by the rush to </p><p>kill Saddam. The litany of lies produced by the White </p><p>House and its neo-con allies would be farcical were it </p><p>not for the deaths of so many Americans and Iraqis. Of </p><p>course, all politicians lie. But lying to get one\'s </p><p>country into an unnecessary war is an outrage, and </p><p>ought to be an impeachable offence." </p><p> </p><p>4.   "Intelligence blunder" </p><p>Under the sub-heading, "War in Iraq was justified, but </p><p>misleading public was not," the right-of-center Calgary </p><p>Herald commented (7/22): "The fact that weapons of mass </p><p>destruction have not yet been found in post-war Iraq is </p><p>a sore spot for those who supported the war. But the </p><p>recent public furor in the U.S. and Britain over </p><p>inaccurate intelligence reports shows that half the </p><p>truth is worse than a whole lie....  Historians may </p><p>forgive Bush\'s and Blair\'s use of hyped-up intelligence </p><p>reports, but voters tend to be far less forgiving. It </p><p>is not yet clear whether the world is a safer place now </p><p>with Saddam out of Iraq, but Americans and Britons have </p><p>good reason to be less trusting of their leaders." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "Where are WMDs?" </p><p>The conservative tabloid Winnipeg Sun (7/15) remarked: </p><p>"It\'s a simple question for U.S. President George Bush </p><p>to answer: Where are Iraq\'s weapons of mass destruction </p><p>(WMD) - whether nuclear, chemical or biological?... </p><p>Iraq\'s WMD - not its WMD program, a word now starting </p><p>to enter the Bush/Blair vocabulary - was the main </p><p>justification for this war. We believed it was a valid </p><p>one.... The moral justification the coalition gave for </p><p>invading Iraq was that it was, in effect, an act of </p><p>self-defence because of Iraq\'s WMD, Saddam\'s proven </p><p>willingness to use them and his known support of </p><p>terrorism. If the coalition cannot produce convincing </p><p>evidence of the WMD it said Iraq had, the moral case </p><p>for launching a pre-emptive war will have been fatally </p><p>undermined." </p><p> </p><p>MIDDLE EAST </p><p>6.   "The real \'road map\' lies behind the scenes" </p><p>Ottawa Citizen contributor David Warren wrote in the </p><p>conservative National Post (7/19): "...The Israel- </p><p>Palestine negotiations are a U.S. State Department </p><p>task, and the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, is the </p><p>chief ball-carrier. But the team behind him is </p><p>remarkable, both for its informality and small size. </p><p>President Bush\'s idea was to keep it this way on </p><p>purpose: to avoid creating the kind of institutional </p><p>force field that pushes problems further away as it </p><p>advances toward them, keeping them insoluble. He </p><p>has instead created the diplomatic equivalent of one of </p><p>the Pentagon\'s special forces, which go in and out of </p><p>hot spots without embedded reporters.... The sort of </p><p>real problems that are being dealt with behind the </p><p>scenes, by truly tireless multi-person shuttle </p><p>diplomacy, include the intifada legacy of Palestinian </p><p>terror cells and media incitement, on the one </p><p>side; and specific, over-visible Israeli security </p><p>measures, on the other. It is less like a </p><p>constitutional progression toward a new Palestinian </p><p>state, and more like a protracted mutual disarmament </p><p>and disengagement between two already existing </p><p>governments. The point is to snuff out the intifada, </p><p>and the Israeli response to the intifada, while </p><p>building a new, and co-operative, security arrangement </p><p>between the two sides, modelled specifically on that </p><p>which already exists between Israel and Jordan. While </p><p>I\'m going out on a limb to write this, I think the </p><p>grander, operatic questions of border drawing and </p><p>refugee settlements are already answered, or </p><p>more precisely, mutually assumed.... It remains, </p><p>unfortunately, in Yasser Arafat\'s interest to wait for </p><p>his moment to blow everything up - since his own power </p><p>increases with conflict and diminishes with peace. It </p><p>is an elaborate game getting him and keeping him </p><p>sidelined - one that\'s still being played. And the </p><p>Europeans, led by the French, continue to indulge the </p><p>soft-headed and immodest policy of throwing him </p><p>diplomatic lifelines, by publicly recognizing him in </p><p>defiance of U.S. pressure. That is the chief external </p><p>thing getting in the way." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
