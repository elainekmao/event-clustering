<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001876 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, CA/OCS, M/MED, and M/DASHO </p><p>HHS FOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, OFFICE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (STEIGER), CDC FOR GLOBAL HEALTH </p><p>OFFICE (COX) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AMED, SOCI, TBIO, ECON, CASC, CA, Health </p><p>SUBJECT: Update 44 - Ontario SARS (July 2, 2003): WHO </p><p>Removes Toronto from List of SARS Affected Areas </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TORONTO SENDS </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Toronto 1816 and previous </p><p> </p><p>World Health Organization (WHO) Removes Toronto from </p><p>List of "Areas with Recent Local Transmission" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>1.In a move anticipated with measured optimism by </p><p>Ontario Health Minister Tony Clement in a July 1 </p><p>televised interview, the WHO on July 2 "removed </p><p>Toronto, Canada, from its list of areas with recent </p><p>local transmission."  The WHO used as its measure the </p><p>fact that 20 days  - double the known incubation period </p><p>for SARS - have passed since a new SARS case surfaced </p><p>in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).  Twenty-two active </p><p>probable cases remain in Toronto.  The WHO, however, </p><p>according to spokesman Christine McNab, determined that </p><p>the disease\'s risk to people in the community is </p><p>"extremely low to zero." </p><p> </p><p>2. During Toronto\'s second bout with SARS, locally </p><p>dubbed "SARS II," the WHO did not reinstate its earlier </p><p>travel advisory on Toronto.  However, Toronto\'s </p><p>presence during May and June on the WHO\'s "local </p><p>transmission" list delayed public/private sector </p><p>marketing programs to bring travelers back to Canada\'s </p><p>largest city - programs which can now be launched with </p><p>confidence. </p><p> </p><p>Keep up the Guard, Experts Caution </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. Despite the good news, both the WHO and Toronto </p><p>experts such as Dr. Donald Low, Mount Sinai Hospital\'s </p><p>chief microbiologist, are urging continued vigilance. </p><p>The mechanisms of SARS\' spread are still not fully </p><p>understood, and modern hospital settings appear to be </p><p>particularly vulnerable to SARS.  Toronto\'s most recent </p><p>SARS fatality, for example, was a front-line nurse. </p><p>The WHO\'s statement notes that the efficient spread of </p><p>the virus in "sophisticated hospital settings may have </p><p>contributed to the severity of Toronto\'s outbreak ... </p><p>certain procedures, such as difficult intubation and </p><p>use of nebulizers that are more common in sophisticated </p><p>hospitals, also increas[e] the risk of infection." </p><p> </p><p>4. A combination of the CDC and Health Canada\'s review </p><p>of hospital procedures, a just-underway Health Canada </p><p>expert committee examination of infectious disease </p><p>controls, and an Ontario provincial lessons-learned </p><p>exercise should help to fine-tune the "new normal" of </p><p>identifying, containing, and dealing with infectious </p><p>diseases, implemented by Ontario\'s Health Ministry last </p><p>month. </p><p> </p><p>June 30 Case Statistics (Ontario Ministry of Health) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5. Summary: </p><p> </p><p>--22 active probable cases (hospitalized/under </p><p>investigation), compared with 37 on June 17.  Of the 21 </p><p>hospitalized cases, 11 are in critical/ deteriorating </p><p>condition. </p><p> </p><p>--2 active suspect cases, compared with 4 on June 17. </p><p>Of the 2, both hospitalized, none are in </p><p>critical/deteriorating condition. </p><p> </p><p>--316 cumulative discharges (probable and suspect), </p><p>compared with 299 on June 17. </p><p>--379 cumulative cases (probable/suspect/ fatalities) </p><p>compared with 375 on June 17. </p><p> </p><p>Case Statistics: </p><p> </p><p>     Probable (Active): </p><p>          21 hospitalized </p><p>           1 under investigation </p><p>           0 home </p><p>         188 cumulative discharges to date. </p><p> </p><p>     Suspect (Active): </p><p>           2 hospitalized </p><p>           0 under investigation </p><p>           0 home </p><p>         128 cumulative discharges to date. </p><p> </p><p>Fatalities: 39 cumulative fatalities to date, compared </p><p>with 33 on June 11. </p><p> </p><p>MARWITZ </p><p></p></div>
