(C) SUMMARY: DANISH MINISTER FOR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>COOPERATION JAN TROJBORG TOLD WESTERN HEADS OF MISSION </p><p>NOVEMBER 8 THAT HE HAD COME TO ZIMBABWE TO SEARCH FOR A </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE COUNTRY\'S CURRENT IMPASSE.  HE VOICED </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PROGRAM\'S (UNDP) EFFORTS TO REKINDLE DIALOGUE AMONG THE </p><p>DONORS, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND OTHER LOCAL </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS AND APPEALED FOR SIMILAR SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>ASSEMBLED DIPLOMATS WHEN UNDP ADMINISTRATOR MARK </p><p>MALLOCH-BROWN VISITED LATER THIS MONTH.  THE DANISH </p><p>MINISTER SAID THE MESSAGE HE BROUGHT FOR PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE (A "MAN WITHOUT A PLAN") WAS TO STOP THE ILLEGAL </p><p>FARM INVASIONS IMMEDIATELY, MAKE SENSIBLE DESIGNATIONS </p><p>OF THOSE FARMS ALREADY ACQUIRED, RESPECT COURT ORDERS </p><p>AND RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE RURAL AREAS, AND </p><p>NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS.  THE PLAINSPOKEN DANE </p><p>ALSO TOLD FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE TO MOVE ON FROM HIS </p><p>OBSESSION WITH THE BRITISH.  FURTHER, HE TOLD THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH A POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT RULING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06317  01 OF 03  091545Z </p><p>AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT ON THE FAST TRACK LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE WOULD BE "UNACCEPTABLE" TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  HE FOUND THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PARLIAMENTARIANS IMPRESSIVE AND </p><p>SEIZED WITH PLANNING STRATEGY, BUT COUNSELED THEM THAT, </p><p>AS THE OPPOSITION, THEY MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE </p><p>WELFARE OF THE COUNTRY AND AVOID EXPOSING THEIR </p><p>FOLLOWERS TO VIOLENCE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) WRAPPING UP A BRIEF FOUR-DAY VISIT TO HARARE </p><p>TRIGGERED BY MEETINGS WITH UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PROGRAM (UNDP) ADMINISTRATOR MARK MALLOCH-BROWN AND </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT MBEKI, DANISH MINISTER FOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION JAN TROJBORG TOLD WESTERN HEADS </p><p>OF MISSION NOVEMBER 8 IN HARARE THAT HE HAD COME TO </p><p>DISCUSS FINDING A SOLUTION TO ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT </p><p>IMPASSE.  AFTER TALKS HE CONCLUDED THAT THE KEY WOULD BE </p><p>TO RESOLVE TWO PROBLEMS: THE LAND ISSUE AND WITHDRAWAL </p><p>OF TROOPS FROM THE CONGO.  NAMING THE PROBLEMS WAS EASY, </p><p>BUT THE DEVIL WAS IN THE DETAIL, HE SAID.  HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S MESSAGE TO ZIMBABWEAN INTERLOCUTORS WAS: </p><p>STOP THE ILLEGAL FARM INVASIONS IMMEDIATELY, MAKE </p><p>SENSIBLE DESIGNATIONS OF THOSE FARMS ALREADY ACQUIRED, </p><p>RESPECT COURT ORDERS AND RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE </p><p>RURAL AREAS, AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS.  "IT </p><p>LOOKS LIKE WE ARE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TWELVE," THE </p><p>MINISTER OBSERVED, "THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE FOR THE </p><p>COUNTRY TO AVOID COLLAPSE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SPEAKING TO PRESIDENT MUGABE, THE DANISH </p><p>MINISTER URGED HIM TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06317  01 OF 03  091545Z </p><p>HERE AND IN THE CONGO.  HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS </p><p>"COMPLICATED" TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM THE CONGO AND </p><p>URGED THE HEADS OF MISSION PRESENT TO HELP ZIMBABWE </p><p>WITHIN THE UN FRAMEWORK.  TROJBORG SAID MUGABE REVIEWED </p><p>IN DETAIL THE HISTORY OF LANCASTER HOUSE, AND THE DANE </p><p>THEN ENDURED A TIRADE AGAINST THE BRITISH AND THE </p><p>CONSPIRACY THEY WERE LEADING AGAINST HIM.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>THE VISITING MINISTER NOTED THAT THE RHETORIC WAS MILDER </p><p>THAN WHAT MUGABE HAD USED ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) TROJBORG CONTINUED THAT HE HAD TOLD PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE THAT THE DONORS HAD REACTED TO HIS POLICIES BY </p><p>CUTTING THEIR BILATERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.  HE </p><p>CAUTIONED THE ZIMBABWEAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE THAT, WHILE HE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD POLITICALLY THE NEED TO LAUNCH A FAST TRACK </p><p>APPROACH, ACQUIRING ALL 5 MILLION HECTARES AT ONCE WAS A </p><p>SURE RECIPE FOR DISASTER.  HE SAID THAT THE FAST TRACK </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE NEEDED A PRECISE DEFINITION AND </p><p>NEEDED TO BE DONE SO AS NOT TO UNDERMINE THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.  AT THE SAME TIME THE PROGRAM </p><p>SHOULD SETTLE REAL FARMERS, AND NOT WAR VETERANS OR </p><p>UNSKILLED PEASANTRY, ON THE FARMS.  HE TOLD THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT THAT IT WAS TIME TO SET PERCEPTIONS </p><p>FROM THE PAST ASIDE AND "LOOK FORWARD," WORDS HE JUDGED </p><p>TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT.  HE NOTED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6932 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06317  02 OF 03  091546Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  COME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------9D19BA  091546Z /38 </p><p>R 091545Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7602 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY COPENHAGEN </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 006317 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID - R.

(C) THE YOUNGER ZIMBABWEAN MINISTERS, ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, UNDERSTOOD THE NEED FOR REFORM AND THAT THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE IS NOT ECONOMIC BUT POLITICAL.  THE DANISH </p><p>POLITICIAN SAW CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE </p><p>POSITIONS OF THE YOUNGER AND THE OLDER MINISTERS. </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE, SAID THAT THERE WERE 100 </p><p>BETTER WAYS TO CONDUCT LAND REFORM, BUT THE COUNTRY </p><p>FOUND ITSELF IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION.  WHEN TROJBORG </p><p>SUGGESTED IT WAS THE FAULT OF THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT, </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTER FOBBED BLAME OFF ON THE BRITISH. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE DANISH MINISTER OBSERVED THERE WAS A "CLEAR </p><p>LACK OF QUALITY" TO THE CURRENT LAND REFORM AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE.  HE HOPED HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS </p><p>ROOM FOR MANEUVER IN IT, AND SAID HE WOULD ENCOURAGE HIS </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION COLLEAGUES TO VISIT ZIMBABWE AND SPEAK </p><p>CLEARLY AND ALONG THE LINES OF THE UNDP MISSION TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) "I HAD AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06317  02 OF 03  091546Z </p><p>OPPOSITION," HE STATED.  HE FOUND MDC MEMBERS OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT WELSHMAN NCUBE AND PAUL NYATHI VERY </p><p>IMPRESSIVE, PARTICULARLY IN THEIR EFFORTS TO FIND A </p><p>STRATEGY TO INFLUENCE EVENTS, CERTAINLY MORE SO THAN THE </p><p>PRESIDENT.  HE FOUND MUGABE TO BE "A MAN WITHOUT A </p><p>PLAN," BUT IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>COULD SET ONE UP QUICKLY IF THE PRESIDENT WOULD GIVE HIS </p><p>MINISTERS THE GREEN LIGHT TO DO SO.  THE MDC WAS </p><p>UNCERTAIN WHETHER IT COULD HOLD MOMENTUM UNTIL ELECTION </p><p>OR WOULD TAKE TO THE STREETS, AND ONCE IT DID SO, IT WAS </p><p>UNCERTAIN IT COULD CONTROL THE SITUATION.  "THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED NOT TO BE RUN OVER BY THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT OF THE STREET," TROJBORG OBSERVED.  THE MDC, </p><p>HE CONTINUED, WOULD ADHERE TO CONSTITUTIONAL MEANS, AND </p><p>THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE EASY TO WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION, AS IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT ANYTHING WOULD CHANGE </p><p>FOR THE POSITIVE VIS-A-VIS THE ECONOMY BEFORE THEN. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, HAVING VOTED THE MDC INTO PARLIAMENT, THE </p><p>PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING RESULTS.  THE DANISH MINISTER TOLD </p><p>THE MDC MEMBERS THAT EVEN AS MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION, </p><p>THE MDC HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT IN THE INTEREST OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY, A STATEMENT WITH WHICH THE PARLIAMENTARIANS </p><p>AGREED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) FINALLY, TROJBORG SAID IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>HIM TO SUSTAIN CURRENT AID LEVELS TO ZIMBABWE IN THE </p><p>FACE OF PUBLIC OPINION OPPOSING IT.  UNLESS THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO CHANGE ITS </p><p>WAYS WITHIN SIX MONTHS, TROJBORG ANNOUNCED HE WOULD BE </p><p>FORCED TO REDUCE IT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06317  02 OF 03  091546Z </p><p>9.  (C) A BRIEF QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION FOLLOWED THE </p><p>MINISTER\'S REMARKS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR SAID SOME DONORS HAD </p><p>RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE CONCLUSION OF THE UN/UNDP </p><p>MISSION, NOTING THAT IT REQUIRED THEM TO PUT MONEY UP- </p><p>FRONT.  IS THIS GOOD?  "SHOULDN\'T THERE BE DISCUSSION </p><p>FIRST?" SHE ASKED.  TROJBORG THOUGHT THE TWO THINGS WENT </p><p>HAND IN HAND, AS THE PLAN REQUIRED TRUST.  THE DANISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT THOUGHT THAT MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND SHOULD </p><p>REST IN INTERNATIONAL HANDS.  COMMENT: USE OF A TRUST </p><p>FUND WHEN THE CONDITIONS ARE APPROPRIATE, BUT IT IS VERY </p><p>UNLIKELY THAT DONORS WILL CONTRIBUTE AT THIS POINT TO A </p><p>TRUST FUND THAT FINANCES THE GOZ FAST TRACK PROGRAM. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE GREEK AMBASSADOR ASKED WHAT THE FINANCE AND </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MINISTER (SIMBA MAKONI) HAD SAID. </p><p>TROJBORG SAID HE HAD NOT MET WITH HIM YET, BUT NOTED </p><p>THAT IN PRAGUE THE ZIMBABWEAN MINISTER HAD SAID, "WE\'LL </p><p>ALL BE DEAD IN THE SPRING, IF THERE IS NO SOLUTION [TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC ILLS]." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR ASKED WHETHER PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>HAD ANY REACTION TO THE MINISTER\'S URGING TO RESPECT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6937 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06317  03 OF 03  091546Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  COME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------9D19D4  091547Z /38 </p><p>R 091545Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7603 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY COPENHAGEN </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 006317 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID - R.

BECAUSE THE FAST-TRACK PROGRAM WAS BEFORE </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ATTACKED THE CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE.  TROJBORG SAID THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ADDRESS </p><p>THE ISSUE, BUT NOTED THAT HE RESPECTED THE RULE OF LAW. </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTER, ON THE OTHER HAND, ADMITTED THAT </p><p>IF THE COURT CASE GOES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, THE </p><p>LATTER WOULD NOT ACCEDE TO THE DECISION.  THE DANISH </p><p>MINISTER SAID THAT WAS "UNACCEPTABLE." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE DUTCH CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES ASKED WHETHER PRESIDENT </p><p>MBEKI HAD BEEN CLEARER ON HIS STAND VIS-A-VIS THE LAND </p><p>QUESTION.  TROJBORG RESPONDED THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>PRESIDENT NOTED THAT THE PROBLEM MUST BE APPROACHED FROM </p><p>ANOTHER ANGLE, AS THE PICTURE IN THE WEST WAS NOT CLEAR, </p><p>A FACT FOR WHICH THE MEDIA BORE THE BLAME.  WHAT WAS </p><p>GOING ON IN ZIMBABWE WAS DEVASTATING FOR ITS ECONOMY AND </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA WOULD BEAR THE BRUNT OF ITS COLLAPSE. </p><p>MUGABE IS VERY EMOTIONAL AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS </p><p>THE PROBLEM WITH HIM, AND AS A RESULT HE GOES BACK TO </p><p>WHAT HE KNOWS BEST, FIGHTING ENEMIES, REAL OR IMAGINED. </p><p>MBEKI SEES THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE AS OUT OF CONTROL. </p><p>THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT NOTED THAT HISTORICAL </p><p>TENSION BETWEEN HIS COUNTRY AND ZIMBABWE PRECLUDED HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06317  03 OF 03  091546Z </p><p>SPEAKING FRANKLY WITH MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVE ASKED IF A </p><p>MISSION FROM THE EU TROIKA MIGHT NOT BE APPROPRIATE TO </p><p>MAKE THE SAME POINTS.  THE DANISH MINISTER RESPONDED </p><p>THAT THE "THE ONLY CARD WE HAVE IS THE UNDP ONE."  HE </p><p>DISCOURAGED SUCH AN INITIATIVE, AND NOTED THAT FOR </p><p>HIMSELF THE MEDIA IN DENMARK WAS CRITICIZING HIM FOR </p><p>COMING TO ZIMBABWE AND CONTINUING AN AID PROGRAM TO A </p><p>DICTATOR.  HE AGAIN MADE A PITCH FOR ALL ASSEMBLED HEADS </p><p>OF MISSION TO SUPPORT THE MALLOCH-BROWN VISIT AND THE </p><p>MESSAGE HE MIGHT BRING, WHICH WOULD BE "NOT TOO SOFT, </p><p>BUT CONSTRUCTIVE." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE BRITISH DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER ASKED WHETHER </p><p>MUGABE WAS KEEN TO RE-ENGAGE THE DONOR COMMUNITY AND WAS </p><p>HE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT OF THE CURRENT </p><p>IMPASSE.  THE DANISH MINISTER SAID THAT HE FOUND MUGABE </p><p>MORE ENGAGED THAN HE SURMISED WOULD BE THE CASE, AND HAD </p><p>SPENT A LOT OF TIME REFLECTING ON THE LAND ISSUE.  HE </p><p>CONTINUES TO STRONGLY DISTRUST OF THE WEST, AND TO </p><p>NURTURE HIS OBSESSION WITH THE BRITISH.  HE RAILED </p><p>AGAINST THE LATTER FOR "RECEIVING" IAN SMITH, CONVEYING </p><p>THE SENSE THAT HE, MUGABE, IS NOT RECEIVED THAT WAY.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM COULD PLAY A VERY </p><p>IMPORTANT ROLE IN RETURNING THE COUNTRY TO NORMALITY. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, MUGABE CALLED ON THE HEADS OF MISSION </p><p>TO ADVISE THE MDC NOT TO TAKE TO THE STREET AND AVOID </p><p>BRINGING VIOLENCE DOWN UPON ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>10.

IT ALSO RECEIVED GOOD ADVICE TO QUIT </p><p>PICKING AT HISTORICAL SCABS AND START LOOKING FORWARD. </p><p>WHETHER OR NOT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE CHOOSES TO ACT </p><p>ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO RE-ENGAGE THE DONORS STILL </p><p>REMAINS TO BE SEEN, BUT DIPLOMATS OF THE WORLD HAVE </p><p>MOBILIZED IN A BID TO STOP THE CLOCK FROM TOLLING </p><p>MIDNIGHT HERE.
