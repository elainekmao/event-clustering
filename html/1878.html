<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002026 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/14/2011 </p><p>TAGS: KDEM, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: THE 2002-2003 ELECTIONS -- THE "BIG </p><p>ENCHILADA" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Joe Baxter, Nigeria Country Director for the </p><p>International Foundation for Election Systems (IFES), called </p><p>on Ambassador Jeter on August 6 to discuss the 2002 local </p><p>government (LG) elections and the national elections in 2003. </p><p> Baxter also discussed the National Identity Card and Voter </p><p>Identity Card projects, and the work and political </p><p>independence of the Nigerian Independent National Election </p><p>Commission (INEC).  According to Baxter, the next six months </p><p>will be critical in terms of voter registration, party </p><p>registration and the passage of the new election law.  Baxter </p><p>emphasized that Nigeria\'s international partners, including </p><p>the U.S., can play a critical role in ensuring fair elections </p><p>free of violence by making clear their expectations for the </p><p>elections.  Traditional and religious leaders also can play a </p><p>key role in keeping election violence to a minimum.  Baxter </p><p>expressed a desire for NGOs and civil society to play an </p><p>active, rather than a solely observational, role in the </p><p>election process.  The Mission has begun to hold regular </p><p>meetings with other "friends of Nigeria" to prepare for the </p><p>upcoming elections, and to design a plan to play an actively </p><p>supportive role in the development of this absolutely </p><p>critical piece in Nigeria\'s consolidation of its democracy, </p><p>including the establishment of a Mission Elections Working </p><p>Group, chaired by the Ambassador.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On August 6, Joe Baxter, the Director of IFES, called </p><p>on Ambassador Jeter to provide an update on IFES work. </p><p>PolMilOff (notetaker) and USAID Democracy and Governance </p><p>Advisor were also in attendance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>IDENTITY PROBLEMS </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to Baxter, President Obasanjo\'s decision to </p><p>select the French SAGEM consortium for the National Identity </p><p>Card project posed difficulty for the upcoming elections. </p><p>INEC had, with IFES endorsement, requested OMR (Optical Mark </p><p>Recognition) technology for voter registration cards (SAGEM\'s </p><p>technology, Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR), is more </p><p>liable to mistakes and therefore is a slower process of data </p><p>input).  Had the President selected a consortium using OMR </p><p>technology, the process of producing voter registration </p><p>cards, as well as national identity cards, would have held </p><p>out the hope of having a computerized voter register for the </p><p>2002 local government elections.  However, with SAGEM getting </p><p>the nod, and the attendant delay in SAGEM\'s inability to </p><p>bring the equipment until January or February, the 2002 local </p><p>government elections would likely go forward with handwritten </p><p>registers and temporary voter cards, both recipes for fraud. </p><p>Baxter opined that the best way to prevent fraud was to have </p><p>high voter registration and turn-out.  However, with SAGEM </p><p>planning only 60,000 registration stations (vice the 120,000 </p><p>identified in the original call for bids), it will be </p><p>difficult for many people living in the North and rural areas </p><p>to register.  Thus, Northerners in particular may see this as </p><p>an attempt to reduce their voter participation.  Baxter said </p><p>that this was why INEC was seeking government approval to go </p><p>it alone for the 2002 local government elections, using </p><p>120,000 registration stations and hand-written rolls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============================================= == </p><p>INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTION COMMISSION (INEC) </p><p>============================================= == </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) INEC\'s credibility has fallen in the eyes of many </p><p>Nigerians.  Many see INEC in the pocket of the PDP (the INEC </p><p>Chairman and other INEC officials are PDP members), but </p><p>according to Baxter the Chairman is not "a PDP stalwart." </p><p>INEC has proposed an election law to the National Assembly, a </p><p>modified version of which will probably be passed this fall. </p><p>The proposed law will raise the bar for registration of </p><p>parties above the requirements established by the </p><p>constitution, a position that reinforces perceptions that the </p><p>INEC is under the influence of the Executive, and thus not </p><p>"independent."  Due to this and other assertions of INEC </p><p>prerogatives, and INEC representatives\' general lack of </p><p>preparedness, INEC took a "beating" during the National </p><p>Assembly hearings on the proposed law.  However, Baxter </p><p>noted, this showed good oversight by the National Assembly, </p><p>also a critical piece of the democratic process.  To regain </p><p>its credibility, INEC needs to work even harder to prove it </p><p>can and will conduct the elections efficiently and without </p><p>bias. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>ELECTIONS ON THE HORIZON </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Local government elections will take place in 2002 </p><p>(for a one year term if the proposed law is passed), and then </p><p>national elections in 2003, which will include local, state </p><p>and federal elections.  (COMMENT: INEC is responsible for </p><p>voter registration in all elections, but the local government </p><p>elections will be managed by independent state electoral </p><p>commissions (ISECs).  ISECs are not seen as being prepared; </p><p>however, aside from supporting more interaction between them </p><p>and INEC and some very basic training, they are not a key </p><p>target for assistance, since the ISECs may be superceded by </p><p>INEC if the new law establishes a uniform date for local, </p><p>state and federal elections in 2003.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to Baxter, the biggest threat to free and </p><p>fair elections is violence and the zero-sum pursuit of </p><p>office, which could include the purchasing of votes and abuse </p><p>of state government owned and controlled media.  (COMMENT: </p><p>State media is controlled directly by the governor. </p><p>Moreover, politics in Nigeria is still dominated by money and </p><p>personalities, not agendas or policy alternatives, so a </p><p>winner-take-all attitude prevails, which may lead to the use </p><p>of violence to manipulate outcomes. END COMMENT.)  Baxter </p><p>stated that a culture of "no-tolerance" toward violence needs </p><p>to be created.  Traditional and religious leaders can have </p><p>the greatest influence in this area.  However, INEC is also </p><p>beginning to develop a code of conduct for the parties, but </p><p>there are still questions about its ability to apply </p><p>sanctions against those who break the rules.  IFES has </p><p>suggested to INEC that the INEC internal code of conduct be </p><p>developed in concert with civil society groups to build </p><p>buy-in to the code.  Internal party codes of conduct will </p><p>also help.  IFES has also suggested INEC hold monthly </p><p>meetings with political parties and the Inter-Party Advisory </p><p>Committee to build confidence and to give them a voice in </p><p>determining the rules of the game.  Moreover, Baxter opined, </p><p>civil society will need to be heavily engaged in the full </p><p>election process - monitoring should be seen as a broad </p><p>process of observing voter registration, party nominations </p><p>and campaigns, as well as voting.  Monitors should be </p><p>prepared to act quickly to publicize infractions.  (COMMENT: </p><p>Nigerian NGOs have also expressed the need for such a </p><p>broadened definition of monitoring as well as for assistance, </p><p>to achieve a sufficient level of preparedness to carry out </p><p>these functions. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador Jeter stated that it would be important to </p><p>establish benchmarks for free and fair elections, and asked </p><p>Baxter what role the Mission and other donors could play at </p><p>this early stage in ensuring a free, fair and transparent </p><p>election process.  Baxter concluded  that donors could have </p><p>the greatest impact by making clear to the GON the </p><p>expectation that elections will have to be peaceful, credible </p><p>and adequately funded.  Moreover, donors could begin to speak </p><p>publicly against election violence to shape public </p><p>expectations.  This election would be the "big enchilada" for </p><p>Nigeria, Baxter stated, and outside attention and assistance </p><p>are critical. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Ambassador Jeter noted that the Mission would begin </p><p>that same week to have internal meetings to plan for its role </p><p>in the elections, and the Mission\'s Elections Working Group </p><p>would meet on a scheduled basis throughout the election </p><p>process.  Regular meetings of donors have already begun to </p><p>turn their focus to elections.  Planning among the "friends </p><p>of Nigeria" could also lead to a joint demarche about </p><p>expectations for the elections.  Baxter was clearly </p><p>supportive of these efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT: Baxter\'s insight into the process leading to </p><p>elections next year and in 2003 were instructive and useful. </p><p>The local government elections in 2002 are likely to be a </p><p>test case for the national elections the following year. </p><p>Thus, efforts by "friends of Nigeria" to emphasize </p><p>non-violence and the importance of free and fair elections in </p><p>the first round will have a direct impact on the 2003 LG, </p><p>State, National Assembly and Presidential polls.  However, </p><p>free and fair elections are not enough; the process leading </p><p>to the elections must be open and transparent as well. </p><p>Embassy plans to use its Elections Working Group to design an </p><p>effective Mission plan for elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) COMMENT CONTINUED: USAID has provided assistance to </p><p>IFES for the past two years, and this assistance is expected </p><p>to continue through 2003.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
