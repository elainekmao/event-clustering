(C)  SUMMARY.  PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S ADDRESS TO </p><p>THE NATION ON INDEPENDENCE DAY WAS </p><p>DISAPPOINTINGLY LACKING IN INDICATING ANY WAY OUT </p><p>OF THE CURRENT CYCLE OF FARM OCCUPATIONS AND </p><p>VIOLENCE.  HE ALSO WAS SILENT ON THE TIMING OF </p><p>THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  SUBSTITUTING BANAL </p><p>WORDS ABOUT PROGRESS SINCE INDEPENDENCE FOR THE </p><p>USUAL PUBLIC CELEBRATIONS, MUGABE MISSED AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP TO A NATION </p><p>THAT NEEDS IT NOW MORE THAN EVER.  HOWEVER, IN </p><p>UNSCRIPTED COMMENTS MOMENTS AFTER HIS PREPARED </p><p>SPEECH, MUGABE SAID HE IS FULL OF ANGER TOWARD </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S FARMERS THAT ARE SEEING THEIR FARMS </p><p>OCCUPIED, AND BELIEVES THEY ARE ENEMIES OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  THE EU DIPLOMATIC GROUP IN HARARE WILL </p><p>NOT UNDERTAKE A JOINT DEMARCHE WITH US TO PROTEST </p><p>THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS.  THEY LOOK TO THEIR </p><p>MINISTERS IN EUROPE TO CARRY THE WATER. </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD BELIEVES IT IS TIME FOR THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE USG TO ENGAGE MUGABE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>  MUGABE MORE DIRECT THAN HIS SPEECHWRITERS </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  READING HIS PREPARED SPEECH TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02164  01 OF 02  191552Z </p><p>NATION ON APRIL 18, ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE DAY, </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE MADE DISAPPOINTINGLY FEW </p><p>COMMENTS ON THE LAND OCCUPATION CRISIS OR THE </p><p>POLITICAL TURMOIL GRIPPING HIS COUNTRY.  THE </p><p>OBSERVATIONS HE DID MAKE COULD MOST CHARITABLY BE </p><p>CALLED A MISSED OPPORTUNITY, SINCE THEY TENDED TO </p><p>LEGITIMIZE THE ACTIONS OF THE SO-CALLED "WAR </p><p>VETERANS" WHO HAVE OCCUPIED, AT VARIOUS TIMES, </p><p>OVER 1000 COMMERCIAL FARMS AND MURDERED TWO </p><p>FARMERS.  MUGABE ALSO DISAPPOINTED THOSE WHO </p><p>THOUGHT HE WOULD USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANNOUNCE </p><p>AN ELECTION DATE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MUGABE OPENED HIS SPEECH WITH A </p><p>DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS ON ZIMBABWE OF THE </p><p>RECENT CYCLONE.  HE REPEATED THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>LINE THAT THE REASON THERE WERE NO PUBLIC </p><p>CEREMONIES TO MARK INDEPENDENCE DAY THIS YEAR IS </p><p>SO THE MONEY SAVED COULD INSTEAD GO TO THE </p><p>VICTIMS OF THE CYCLONE.  IT IS SPECULATED THAT </p><p>PUBLIC EVENTS WERE NOT SCHEDULED BECAUSE THE </p><p>PRESIDENT FEARED NO ONE WOULD ATTEND OR HE WOULD </p><p>BE MET BY PROTESTERS.  MUGABE DID NOT COME TO THE </p><p>LAND OCCUPATION ISSUE UNTIL ABOUT 20 MINUTES INTO </p><p>HIS SPEECH.  MUCH OF HIS INITIAL REMARKS COVERED, </p><p>IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL, STATISTICS SUCH AS THE </p><p>NUMBER OF BOREHOLES IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, INTENDED </p><p>TO PROVE THAT ZIMBABWE HAS IMPROVED SINCE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN A SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEW IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02164  01 OF 02  191552Z </p><p>BROADCAST STUDIO\'S LOBBY WITH LOCAL TELEVISION </p><p>THAT APPEARED UNSCRIPTED, MUGABE MADE SOME VERY </p><p>DIRECT STATEMENTS THAT HE IS FULL OF ANGER TOWARD </p><p>THE FARMERS AND SEES THEM AS ENEMIES OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p>IT CERTAINLY APPEARS THAT THIS STATEMENT IS MORE </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH HIS ACTIONS THAN HIS SCRIPTED </p><p>TELEVISION ADDRESS, AND PROBABLY REVEALS MORE </p><p>CLEARLY HIS PRESENT STATE OF MIND. </p><p> </p><p>  NO DESIRE FROM EUROPEANS FOR A DEMARCHE </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN UNDERWHELMING TO </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD\'S RECOMMENDATION TO HIS </p><p>EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES THAT A JOINT DEMARCHE TO </p><p>MUGABE BE UNDERTAKEN TO PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>OBJECTIONABLE STATEMENTS AND TOLERANCE FOR THE </p><p>GROWING CLIMATE OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION </p><p>(REFTELS).  THE LOCAL EU POSITION IS THAT THEY DO </p><p>NOT THINK HARARE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE FORUM FOR </p><p>STATEMENTS TO BE MADE.  INSTEAD, THEY WILL LOOK </p><p>TO THEIR CAPITALS TO TAKE THE LEAD.  OUR POSITION </p><p>IS THAT A STATEMENT CAN COME FROM BRUSSELS, BUT </p><p>SHOULD ALSO BE DONE JOINTLY IN HARARE IN A </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO8784 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02164  02 OF 02  191552Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-01   VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------4DC41B  191553Z /38 </p><p>R 191557Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5792 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>ALL EUROPEAN UNION POST COLLECTIVE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002164 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PARIS PLEASE PASS TO A/S SUSAN E. RICE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF PDAS POWELL, AF DAS SCHNEIDMAN, </p><p>AF/S DIRECTOR RENDER, AF/S DESK OFFICER GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/19/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE\'S SCRIPT DISAPPOINTS, BUT LATER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02164  02 OF 02  191552Z </p><p>CANDOR IS REVEALING </p><p> </p><p>FORCEFUL MANNER.  AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ALSO </p><p>LEARNED THAT A SENIOR EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT MAY COME </p><p>HERE TO DELIVER A STRONG MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: TIME TO TALK TO MUGABE </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  WE BELIEVE MUGABE\'S UNSCRIPTED REMARKS </p><p>ABOUT SEEING THE FARMERS AS ENEMIES OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>REVEAL HIS PRESENT STATE OF MIND.  AFTER 20 YEARS </p><p>IN POWER HE APPEARS INCAPABLE OF DISTINGUISHING </p><p>HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS AND INTERESTS FROM THOSE OF </p><p>THE NATION AT LARGE AND DISINTERESTED IN TRYING </p><p>TO DO SO.  WE ALSO THINK IT IS CLEAR THAT THE </p><p>TARGET OF HIS IRE IS NOT THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS, </p><p>WHITES, OR BRITAIN AS THE FORMER COLONIAL POWER </p><p>PER SE--ALTHOUGH ALL ARE HIGH ON HIS LIST OF </p><p>DISLIKES--BUT RATHER THAT HE IS TRYING TO GET AT </p><p>AND DISRUPT THE NEW AND RELATIVELY EFFECTIVE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY, THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHANGE, HOWEVER HE CAN.  BECAUSE THE FARMERS HAVE </p><p>EXERCISED THEIR DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS TO FREE SPEECH </p><p>AND POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN SUPPORT OF THE MDC, </p><p>THEY ARE TARGETS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  I BELIEVE IT IS TIME FOR THE HIGHEST </p><p>LEVELS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO MAKE </p><p>KNOWN TO MUGABE THAT WE WELL UNDERSTAND HIS </p><p>POSITION AND REJECT IT AS HE IS SENDING THE </p><p>COUNTRY IN A DISASTROUS DIRECTION.  ZIMBABWE MUST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02164  02 OF 02  191552Z </p><p>BE A NATION BASED ON LAWS, NOT ON THE </p><p>CALCULATIONS OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY OF ONE MAN </p><p>OR ONE PARTY.  THE INCREASING LAWLESSNESS HERE IS </p><p>ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DELIBERATE ACTIONS AND </p><p>CALCULATED INACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT, STARTING </p><p>WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE.  BY THE SAME TOKEN, THE </p><p>DOWNWARD TREND HERE IS REVERSABLE, SHOULD MUGABE </p><p>DECIDE TO FOLLOW THE PATH OF POLITICAL TOLERANCE, </p><p>WHICH IS, AFTER ALL IS SAID AND DONE, TRULY IN </p><p>HIS SELF INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  ACCORDINGLY, I BELIEVE A TELEPHONE CALL </p><p>TO PRESIDENT MUGABE FROM PRESIDENT CLINTON, VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT GORE, OR SECRETARY ALBRIGHT SHOULD BE </p><p>PLACED AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME.  WE SHOULD </p><p>ALSO MOVE FORWARD TO CONFIRM THE PROPOSED VISIT </p><p>OF U/S PICKERING.  BY URGING MUGABE TO STEP BACK </p><p>FROM THE BRINK WE WILL BE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO </p><p>SALVAGE DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW IN ZIMBABWE, </p><p>NOT TO MENTION THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY AND THE </p><p>LIVES OF SOME OF ITS CITIZENS-  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
