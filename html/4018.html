<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 006060 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS FOR ANE/MEA KIM FINAN </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PAUL THANOS </p><p>USDOC FOR 6400/ITA/TD/OEC/KFERGUSON </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p>TDA FOR SIGLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, BEXP, EINV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: A VIRTUAL SUCCESS: JORDAN\'S ICT FORUM </p><p> </p><p>REF: Amman 4595 </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) SUMMARY: Jordan\'s second ICT Forum was held Sept. 30-Oct. </p><p>1 in Amman.  Featuring addresses by King Abdullah, Intel CEO Craig </p><p>Barrett, John Gage, Chief Researcher and Director of the Science </p><p>Office for Sun Microsystems, and AOL Strategic Advisor George </p><p>Vradenburg, the event attracted more than 1200 participants from </p><p>the Middle East, Europe, the Far East, and the U.S.  The event, </p><p>funded through USAID\'s AMIR program, highlighted the strengths and </p><p>potential of Jordan\'s ICT industry.  A presentation by IT </p><p>consultant firm McConnell International gave a candid assessment </p><p>of the sector\'s challenges in Jordan, and a progress report on </p><p>Jordan\'s national IT strategy, REACH, provided an update on the </p><p>Jordanian IT sector.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Where Can I Get More of These Virtual Ministers </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) As a successor to the premiere forum held in March 2000, </p><p>the ICT Forum opened September 30.  With most of the Cabinet, </p><p>including PM Ali Abul Ragheb, flanking the King, the Forum\'s </p><p>energetic setting--featuring rock music, high-tech special </p><p>effects, and polished presenter BusinessWeek\'s Scott Shuster-- </p><p>succeeded in grabbing the participants\' attention at the outset. </p><p>In addition to the keynote speakers, the two-day agenda included </p><p>workshops in e-government, industry development and capital and </p><p>finance in Jordan, and the unveiling of the "REACH 3.0" report. </p><p>The event was hosted and organized by the Ministry of Information </p><p>Communications and Technology (MOICT) and the Information </p><p>Technology Association of Jordan (INT@J). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Minister of ICT Fawwaz Zu\'bi launched the opening session </p><p>in the form of a "virtual minister", a computer-generated </p><p>depiction of Zu\'bi, using technology created by Rubicon, an up and </p><p>coming Jordanian IT firm.  The real Zu\'bi, a progressive minister </p><p>well-known to the Embassy, frankly acknowledged Jordan\'s IT </p><p>challenges while emphasizing the sector\'s strengths.  He said that </p><p>further progress is needed in developing e-commerce, e-security, </p><p>and continued IT training in the Kingdom.  He said that if Jordan </p><p>has a niche, it must be in the field of education, given its rich </p><p>human capital.  He stressed that the government was concentrating </p><p>on education, and to that end was moving forward by leaps and </p><p>bounds, having increased the number of schools connected to the </p><p>Internet (the result of the government\'s "Connecting Jordanians" </p><p>initiative) from 40 in June to over 400 in September.  Zu\'bi </p><p>closed by saying that Jordan "must take the tide" now, to further </p><p>build on its strengths and become the regional IT leader it is </p><p>capable of being. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) INTEL CEO Barrett\'s high-tech presentation focused on the </p><p>future of IT and a balanced appraisal of IT in Jordan.  He said </p><p>that Jordan has "moved aggressively" in educational policy, </p><p>infrastructure capability, and the use of IT by the government </p><p>itself, all preconditions for Jordan to "unlock its IT power." </p><p>Barrett pointed out that students below the age of 15 represented </p><p>one-third of Jordan\'s population, presenting Jordan with the </p><p>perfect opportunity to work now to develop the human capital vital </p><p>to the knowledge-based, tech-driven that will bring Jordan to the </p><p>cutting edge in ten years.  At the same time the government needed </p><p>to do more to foster entrepreneurship, and remove residual tax, </p><p>tariff, and intellectual property rights barriers that continue to </p><p>hinder the growth of IT in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) After asking Zu\'bi where he could find "more of these </p><p>virtual ministers", King Abdullah urged the private and public </p><p>sectors to "get their acts together" to continue to develop </p><p>Jordan\'s IT sector, upon which, he said, the country was placing </p><p>high hopes.  The King dismissed the idea of a brain drain, saying </p><p>that IT-savvy Jordanians throughout the world had formed a </p><p>Jordanian network that amounted to a "brain gain".  Still, he </p><p>said, it was important to keep the best and brightest in the </p><p>Kingdom in order to continue Jordan\'s impressive momentum in IT. </p><p>The King urged all in attendance "to think outside the box" and </p><p>said that he needed to hear from anyone who had ideas on what may </p><p>be required to help Jordan\'s IT industry continue to grow. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>AN ACTIVE CHILD UNDERGOING A GROWTH SPURT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The Forum\'s most-awaited presentation may have been that </p><p>of Rosslyn Doktor of McConnell International (MI), billed as an </p><p>objective assessment of ICT in Jordan.  Doktor opened her remarks </p><p>by comparing the sector to "an active child undergoing a growth </p><p>spurt".  She said that Jordan\'s "could be among the successful </p><p>economies looking at ICT as a ticket to economic prosperity", but </p><p>the country\'s current e-readiness position was "average". </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) In presenting the final report, Doktor stressed strategic </p><p>actions, such as the demonstrated resolve of the King to make </p><p>Jordan e-ready, the success of active public/private initiatives, </p><p>the country\'s commitment to further develop its young, well- </p><p>educated population, and some achievements in regulatory and legal </p><p>reform, in which Jordan had made some progress.  However, she </p><p>added, "the glass is half full".  Describing five attributes, </p><p>connectivity, e-leadership, information security, human capital, </p><p>and the e-business climate MI used to measure Jordan\'s e- </p><p>readiness, Jordan was "exactly in the middle" when compared to 18 </p><p>developed and developing countries that had various commonalities </p><p>with Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) In terms of connectivity, Jordan was ranked low to medium. </p><p>Doktor said the immediate challenges were a monopoly telecom </p><p>provider in place until 2005, low internet user penetration, and </p><p>the absence of a strong regulator.  E-leadership is one of </p><p>Jordan\'s strong suits, judged medium-high by MI, given the King\'s </p><p>"tireless" support, the coordinating role of the MOICT in e- </p><p>policy, and the recognition of the importance of e-government by </p><p>nearly all government agencies.  The report assigned low to medium </p><p>marks to the Kingdom for e-security due to a lack of a public e- </p><p>security infrastructure and encryption policies, and an inadequate </p><p>government and private sector approach to the monitoring and </p><p>protection of information security.  The human capital attribute </p><p>was graded medium, with a need for increased network access </p><p>throughout primary and secondary schools, expansion of e-learning </p><p>initiatives for the currently employed and unemployed, and more R </p><p>& D.  Finally, Jordan was given low marks for e-commerce, with a </p><p>low adoption rate by IT on the part of the private sector, too few </p><p>programs that address the needs of small and medium enterprises, </p><p>and a lack of electronic payment facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>JORDAN IS GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT . . . </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) At a gala Forum dinner by the Dead Sea, AOL-Time Warner\'s </p><p>George Vradenburg said that Jordan was on the right track.  He </p><p>opined that, with educational reforms, a greater emphasis on e- </p><p>commerce, and more legislation on e-security, "Jordan is going to </p><p>happen; it\'s just a matter of time".   But, he cautioned, a </p><p>conflict in Iraq could disrupt Jordan\'s progress, with economic </p><p>dislocation, an influx of refugees, and a negative impact on </p><p>infrastructure all possible outcomes.  Nonetheless, he urged his </p><p>audience "to be prepared to ride out the short-term instability" </p><p>with an eye toward "becoming the regional IT leader in a post- </p><p>Saddam Middle East. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>REACH 3 </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) The updated "REACH 3.0" strategy for developing IT in </p><p>Jordan emphasized the country\'s commitment to its strategic IT </p><p>vision, despite market corrections and regional instability that </p><p>have affected regional trade and foreign investment.  (Note: The </p><p>REACH national strategy for IT was initiated in 1999 by a core </p><p>group representing Jordan\'s IT sector, with the assistance of </p><p>USAID and other international consultants, in response to the </p><p>King\'s challenge to prioritize and program Jordan\'s IT </p><p>development.  The original targets set by REACH 1.0 call for the </p><p>creation of 20,000 IT and 10,000 IT-related jobs, $550 million in </p><p>annual exports, and $150 million in foreign direct investment in </p><p>the sector, all by 2004.  End note) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Ra\'ed Bilbessi, CEO of INT@J, the local IT business </p><p>association, presented the REACH 3.0 report to the Forum, and said </p><p>that, while progress had been made, much more work remained.  Out </p><p>of the 52 strategic actions that came out of REACH 1.0, eight had </p><p>been completed, five were ongoing, 30 were partially completed, </p><p>and only nine were pending, that is, no action had yet been taken. </p><p>Regarding the REACH 1.0 targets, Bilbeesi noted that 5000 IT jobs </p><p>had been created in Jordan as of 2001, with IT companies </p><p>generating $27 million in exports, and FDI amounted to $60 </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Bilbessi stressed that the development of human capital, </p><p>Jordan\'s richest asset, continues to be the priority for the IT </p><p>sector.  He noted the Connecting Jordanians Initiative, the </p><p>national campaign introduced by the MOICT to "incorporate ICT into </p><p>the daily lives of all Jordanians", improving and ensuring </p><p>Internet access throughout the Kingdom.  With United Nations </p><p>Development Program (UNDP) assistance, the Ministry of Education </p><p>was investing $67 million in training 6000 teachers in basic </p><p>computer literacy.  Roger Guichard, USAID-funded Advisor of Policy </p><p>and Strategy for the MOICT, pointed out that putting more </p><p>disposable income in the hands of Jordanians would increase </p><p>Internet penetration rates, currently at 1.3% of the population. </p><p>To that end, he said, REACH 3.0 called for a telecom price </p><p>benchmark and Internet study, a national campaign to raise </p><p>awareness of the Internet\'s benefits, and the expansion of </p><p>Jordan\'s IT Community Centers, currently numbering 20 across the </p><p>country.  USAID is beginning a study, through the AMIR Program, to </p><p>ascertain the best means for the centers to achieve long-term </p><p>sustainability. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>DEALS ANNOUNCED </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) At the Forum, Jordanian paging services company Mirsal </p><p>announced an agreement to operate a digital public trunked radio </p><p>network based on Motorola\'s IDEN technology, which allows "push to </p><p>talk" radio access, primarily for police and other emergency </p><p>service applications.  The $47 million investment will create over </p><p>200 jobs in Jordan, with completion of the network expected by the </p><p>end of 2003.  In addition, wireless communications company </p><p>Qualcomm announced plans to locate its regional CDMA (Code </p><p>Division Multiple Access) business development center in Amman. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14  (U) Following the King\'s admonition at the Forum\'s close that </p><p>Jordan\'s IT industry "has the opportunity to set the standards and </p><p>show the way to build a better region for all," most of the </p><p>attendees waxed enthusiastic about the content and presentation of </p><p>the event, but agreed that while Jordan was on the way to becoming </p><p>a regional IT player, it had some work to do to get there.  If </p><p>anything, some participants told us, the challenges were even </p><p>greater, given Jordan\'s creaky IT infrastructure, lack of adequate </p><p>IT training throughout the educational system, and the high cost </p><p>of connecting Jordanians nationwide.  Still, the Forum showcased </p><p>well the King and the Government of Jordan\'s commitment to pursue </p><p>regional leadership in ICT through educational reform, a more open </p><p>IT market, and a commitment to ensure IT access to all Jordanians. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
