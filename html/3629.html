Under headline "Zim troops return as heroes" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" dedicated its </p><p>      September 3 editorial to urging the United Nations to </p><p>      deploy "more peacekeeping forces" into the Democratic </p><p>      Republic of Congo (DRC) "to avoid the creation of a </p><p>      vacuum," as Zimbabwean troops begin pulling out of that </p><p>      country.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.    ". . .As the army (Zimbabwe National Army) begins </p><p>      pulling out of the DRC it leaves behind a legacy of </p><p>      military professionalism.  The new DRC army that emerges </p><p>      after the war will no doubt try to emulate the high </p><p>      standards set by the Zimbabweans.          . . .Zimbabwe </p><p>      committed resources and soldiers to the DRC war and should </p><p>      benefit economically as peace returns to the Congo. . . </p><p>      The business opportunities would have been non-existent if </p><p>      the army had not flown into the DRC as rebels advanced. </p><p>      . . .Zimbabwean troops are, therefore, returning as heroes </p><p>      who on one hand successfully defended the territorial </p><p>      integrity and sovereignty of the DRC while on the other </p><p>      opened a new economic frontier for the country. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Had Uganda and Rwanda\'s military adventures </p><p>      and expansionist policies been successful, a </p><p>      terrible precedent would have been set with </p><p>      disastrous consequences for the continent.  The </p><p>      intervention of SADC was, therefore, necessary and </p><p>      justified.  For peace to continue to hold, it is now </p><p>      critical that the United Nations deploys more </p><p>      peacekeeping forces to avoid the creation of a </p><p>      vacuum.  While the Congolese people chart the </p><p>      political destiny of their country the UN should not </p><p>      let them down by dragging its feet in dispatching </p><p>      thousands of peacekeeping forces.  The peace that is </p><p>      now being enjoyed in the Congo came at a heavy price </p><p>      and the UN has to play its part in moving the peace </p><p>      process forward. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
