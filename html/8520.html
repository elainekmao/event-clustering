ROME 2284 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR </p><p>THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES IN THE PM\'S OFFICE, THE MFA, </p><p>AND THE EMBASSY OF ISRAEL, PM BERLUSCONI WILL VISIT ISRAEL </p><p>JUNE 9 WHERE HE WILL MEET WITH PM SHARON AND POSSIBLY </p><p>PRESIDENT KATSAV.

POLMIN CHECKED THIS </p><p>INFORMATION WITH PAOLO DIONISI, ONE OF THE PM\'S DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISERS, IN A JUNE 5 LUNCH.

THE "LODO MACCANICO" PASSED THE ITALIAN </p><p>    SENATE ON JUNE 5; THE GOI HAS SAID IT WILL BE FINALLY PASSED </p><p>BEFORE JUNE 21.
