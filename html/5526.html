Cheney urged Gul to secure swift </p><p>parliamentary approval for the deployment of U.S. troops in </p><p>Turkey.  Gul said that the issue would be discussed in </p><p>parliament on February 18.  Gul told Cheney that the issue </p><p>of modernization of Turkish bases and ports would be </p><p>approved by the parliament before February 11, the Sacrifice </p><p>Holiday.  "Radikal" believes that U.S. and Turkish officials </p><p>are about to reach an agreement on the legal framework of </p><p>cooperation regarding Iraq.  Meanwhile, President Bush\'s </p><p>Iraq advisor, Zalmay Khalilzad, arrived in Ankara for talks </p><p>with Northern Iraqi Kurdish groups and Turkoman </p><p>representatives on Thursday.  MFA officials will also attend </p><p>the meetings to explain Turkey\'s expectations concerning </p><p>regional ethnic groups.  Secretary Powell\'s address to the </p><p>UNSC on Wednesday might speed Ankara\'s Iraq decision, </p><p>according to press reports.  Prime Minister Gul is expected </p><p>to address AKP deputies right after Powell\'s speech to urge </p><p>them to approve the drafts for cooperation with the U.S. </p><p>Gul will also explain to cabinet members at the council of </p><p>ministers meeting today the necessity to cooperate with the </p><p>U.S.-led international effort in order to protect Turkey\'s </p><p>interests.  Speaking to his party group on Tuesday, AKP </p><p>leader Erdogan said that a parliamentary decision approving </p><p>Turkey\'s involvement in a war could contribute to peace. </p><p>`We might not be allowed to influence developments later if </p><p>we stay out of the calculations in the beginning,\' Erdogan </p><p>said.  "Zaman" estimates that about 50 AKP deputies will </p><p>vote against the bill to allow modernization of Turkish </p><p>bases.  The paper expects the bill to be approved with the </p><p>votes of at least 300 AKP deputies.  A "Yeni Safak" </p><p>commentary carries a January public opinion poll by the ANAR </p><p>company which shows 94 percent of Turks opposed to U.S. </p><p>intervention in Iraq.  78 percent of respondents are against </p><p>Turkey\'s involvement in a war either by sending troops or </p><p>opening Turkish bases to the United States.  "Hurriyet" </p><p>claims that the U.S. will send early warning AWACS planes </p><p>and Patriot defense missile systems to Turkey from U.S. </p><p>bases in the Netherlands next week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Parliamentary Speaker on by-elections: Commenting on the </p><p>Siirt elections on March 9 in which AKP leader Erdogan will </p><p>have an opportunity to run for parliament, Parliamentary </p><p>Speaker Arinc noted that the Constitution has a clause which </p><p>authorizes parliament to postpone elections for up to a </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p>"Being emotional is not helpful when war is inevitable" </p><p>Mehmet Barlas commented in mass appeal Aksam (2/5): "Turkey </p><p>is clearly under US pressure for a clear decision on Iraq. </p><p>Reports also note that the US has already formulated a `Plan </p><p>B\' in the absence of Turkey\'s permission for the deployment </p><p>of US troops for a northern front. . The latest comment by </p><p>AKP leader Erdogan was realistic, as he was defending </p><p>Turkey\'s involvement in what has become an inevitable war. </p><p>This message was especially meant for the AKP deputies. </p><p>They better think about the cost of being left out in the </p><p>post-war period.  That requires a cool-headed thinking, an </p><p>analysis free from anger and emotionalism.  Belated </p><p>decisions are sometimes regarded as if they never existed." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bush should ask for Congressional authorization for Turkey" </p><p>Sedat Ergin wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (2/5): "The most </p><p>critical part of the ongoing US-Turkey bargaining is about </p><p>the nature of the US commitment to address Turkey\'s losses </p><p>during the coming war.  The issue centers on whether US </p><p>promises will turn into binding commitments.  It remains to </p><p>be seen whether President Bush will seek Congressional </p><p>approval for compensation plan for Turkey.  . The Egypt case </p><p>stands as a good example.  During the Gulf war, the US </p><p>administration obtained an authorization from Congress to </p><p>eliminate Egypt\'s FMS debt in order to entice the Egyptians </p><p>to participate in the international coalition against Iraq." </p><p>"The northern front issue" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (2/5): "Turkey </p><p>should take into account US plans to open the northern front </p><p>at all costs.  By permitting the transit movement of US </p><p>troops from Turkey, Ankara will actually have a chance to </p><p>control northern Iraq together with Washington. Refusal to </p><p>cooperate, on the other hand, will create huge troubles for </p><p>Turkey. .A military source from Washington says that the </p><p>operation could be launched at the beginning of March, and </p><p>that the US needs two or three weeks for site preparations. </p><p>The Turkish government will fall short of US expectations by </p><p>delaying its decision until the end of the holiday. .A </p><p>source close to the government says that the government </p><p>wanted to exhaust all peaceful means before sending to </p><p>parliament a decision for the deployment of US troops in </p><p>Turkey." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
