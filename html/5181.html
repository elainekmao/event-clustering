<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PGOV, PHUM, NP, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: THREE MORE TIBETANS JAILED IN NEPAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael Malinowski for reasons b,d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Nepali Immigration Courts have sentenced </p><p>three Tibetans to three years\' imprisonment for failure to </p><p>pay fines and visa fees resulting from their illegal presence </p><p>in Nepal.  UNHCR and the Office of Tibet have objected to the </p><p>sentences, saying that the three Tibetans were on their way </p><p>to India, and should have been handed over to UNHCR as </p><p>"persons of concern."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Three Tibetans, including two teenagers, have been </p><p>sentenced to approximately three years in jail for failure to </p><p>pay immigration fines handed down by Nepali courts on January </p><p>8.  Yanglha Tso (age 15), Samdup (age 15) and Tashi (age 30) </p><p>were arrested on December 13, 2002 in Boudha, a predominantly </p><p>Tibetan area of Kathmandu.  Nepal\'s Department of Immigration </p><p>determined that the three were illegally present in Nepal and </p><p>fined them each a total of 29085 NRs (372 USD).  Unable to </p><p>pay the fines, the three have been sentenced to "serve off" </p><p>the amount at a rate of 25 NRs per day.  The total sentence </p><p>is approximately three years imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) According to Wangchuk Tsering, the Dalai Lama\'s </p><p>Representative in Nepal, the three Tibetans crossed the </p><p>border from Tibet without documentation approximately two </p><p>weeks before their arrest, intending to transit to India. </p><p>After traveling to Kathmandu, they stayed for approximately </p><p>three days in Boudha, a predominantly Tibetan area of the </p><p>capital, before they were picked up by police.  The Home </p><p>Ministry told PolOff that the three Tibetans were in </p><p>violation of Nepali immigration law, which does not allow </p><p>Tibetans to settle in Nepal, and indicated to Tsering that </p><p>the three had overstayed an unspecified "time limit." </p><p>However, Tsering asserts that the Tibetans had no intention </p><p>to stay.  "They simply didn\'t know where to go," he said in a </p><p>phone conversation with PolOff.  "They had just arrived, and </p><p>were trying to find out how to get to India." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) UNHCR has spoken to the GON on several occasions, </p><p>reminding them of the "gentleman\'s agreement," under which </p><p>GON authorities have informally agreed to report newly </p><p>arrived Tibetans seeking transit to India to UNHCR for </p><p>processing as "persons of concern."  However, UNHCR </p><p>Protection Officer Cecilia Becker indicates that the GON has </p><p>been uncooperative in this case.  The GON has not explained </p><p>why police did not call UNHCR when they first encountered the </p><p>Tibetans, nor why they did not release them once it was </p><p>learned that they had only been in Nepal for a short time and </p><p>were seeking to transit to India. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The arrests bring the total number of Tibetans </p><p>currently in jail for failure to pay immigration fines to </p><p>twelve, though the number may soon drop back to eleven.  Two </p><p>of the eleven refugees arrested last year have been released </p><p>following payment of their fines by German philanthropic </p><p>organizations, and UNHCR told PolOff that a third is likely </p><p>to be released under the same circumstances on Monday. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  These three arrests mark another step </p><p>backward in the formerly cooperative relationship that UNHCR </p><p>has enjoyed with the GON.  Reported comments about a "time </p><p>limit" for Tibetans transiting to India are worrisome </p><p>indications that the "gentleman\'s agreement" is being </p><p>increasingly ignored by the GON.  Perhaps most worrisome are </p><p>reports from UNHCR that the current Director of Immigration </p><p>(DOI), appointed in November, has hinted that he does not </p><p>believe that any such agreement exists.  (Note:  The </p><p>Kathmandu respresentative of the International Campaign for </p><p>Tibet has confirmed that the DOI told him very bluntly that </p><p>"no such agreement exists." End note.)  Post has called upon </p><p>the Home Ministry to reinforce the GON\'s commitment to the </p><p>"gentlemen\'s agreement," and will continue to express our </p><p>support for UNHCR\'s efforts to facilitate the travel of </p><p>legitimate asylum seekers on their way to India. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
