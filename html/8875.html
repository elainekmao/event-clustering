<p>UNCLAS HANOI 001555 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, G/TIP, and DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KCRM, KWMN, PGOV, SOCI, VM, TIP </p><p>SUBJECT:  GVN Complains TIP Report Shorts Its Efforts </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Assistant Foreign Minister Nguyen Duc Hung </p><p>complained to DCM during a June 20 meeting at the Ministry </p><p>of Foreign Affairs (MFA) that Vietnam\'s placement on Tier II </p><p>and in particular the evaluation of Vietnam\'s law </p><p>enforcement efforts against Trafficking in Persons do not </p><p>"truly reflect reality."  He said that GVN law enforcement </p><p>agencies had asked MFA to convey their displeasure with the </p><p>report and their view that the trafficking situation is much </p><p>better than depicted.  AFM Hung pointed out that the GVN </p><p>severely punishes traffickers.  He also took issue with the </p><p>TIP report\'s mention that rehabilitation centers have been </p><p>criticized for "reeducation" and limiting victims\' freedom </p><p>of movement.  AFM Hung also raised the GVN working group </p><p>responsible for coordinating efforts against TIP as an </p><p>example of the SRV\'s seriousness in addressing the issue. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  DCM and poloff responded that some GVN law </p><p>enforcement officials contacted about TIP have painted a </p><p>much brighter picture than their colleagues in other </p><p>ministries and officials from government-sponsored mass </p><p>organizations such as the Women\'s Union.  Also law </p><p>enforcement officials in Hanoi have been more forthright </p><p>about TIP than some of their provincial counterparts.  DCM </p><p>and poloff stated that Mission officers have visited the </p><p>some of the rehabilitation facilities and believe that the </p><p>report is accurate.  Poloff noted that while the GVN does </p><p>have a coordinating committee for TIP, the GVN itself has </p><p>found the mechanism ineffective and is taking steps to </p><p>improve it. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
