<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 006094 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IS, IT, PREL, KPAL, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: NETANYAHU IN ROME: SUCCESSFUL FIRST TRIP AS FM </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEL AVIV 7148 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: ROME WAS ISRAEL FM NETANYAHU\'S FIRST STOP IN </p><p>HIS FIRST EUROPEAN TOUR SINCE HE ASSUMED THE FUNCTIONS OF FM. </p><p> BOTH SIDES PLACED EMPHASIS ON THE GREATER BALANCE IN ITALY\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06094  201802Z </p><p>APPROACH TO THE MIDDLE EAST SINCE BERLUSCONI TOOK OFFICE, </p><p>THOUGH THE ITALIANS MADE CLEAR TO NETANYAHU THAT THEY WILL </p><p>NOT SEVER ALL CONTACT WITH ARAFAT.  NETANYAHU BELIEVES THAT </p><p>THE EU\'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON THE CONFLICT WILL BE MORE </p><p>EVENHANDED DURING ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY THE SECOND HALF OF </p><p>2003, THOUGH HE HAD NO ENTHUSIASM FOR THE EU ROLE WITHIN THE </p><p>QUARTET. SENIOR ITALIAN OFFICIALS REITERATED THEIR BELIEF IN </p><p>THE ROLE OF THE QUARTET AND THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE "ROAD </p><p>MAP" LEADING TO THE CREATION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE EXISTING </p><p>IN PEACE AND SECURITY NEXT TO THE STATE OF ISRAEL.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) NETANYAHU HAD A BUSY TWO-DAY VISIT TO ROME DEC 18-19 </p><p>WHERE HE MET WITH PM BERLUSCONI, FM FRATTINI, MOD MARTINO, </p><p>DEPUTY PM FINI, PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE PERA, AND PRESIDENT </p><p>OF THE HOUSE CASINI.  AMBASSADOR SEMBLER HOSTED A DINNER FOR </p><p>NETANYAHU, A LONG TIME ACQUAINTANCE, DEC 18. AT ALL THESE </p><p>EVENTS, AND IN HIS PUBLIC COMMENTS, NETANYAHU\'S CORE TALKING </p><p>POINTS TRACKED CLOSELY WITH HIS RECENT CAMPAIGN SPEECHES AND </p><p>WITH THE PRESENTATION HE GAVE TO CODEL PRICE/DAVIS (REFTEL): </p><p>THE ISSUE IS NOT ISRAEL\'S OCCUPATION, BUT THE WORLDWIDE </p><p>ISLAMIC TERRORISM; ISRAEL HAS BEEN TOO RESTRAINED IN NOT </p><p>EXILING ARAFAT; PALESTINIANS CAN HAVE SELF-GOVERNMENT, BUT </p><p>NEVER A STATE, ETC. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  OUR ITALIAN AND ISRAELI SOURCES TOLD US THAT LITTLE </p><p>NEW INFORMATION WAS DISCUSSED IN THE MEETINGS WHICH THEY </p><p>DESCRIBED NONETHELESS AS "USEFUL" FOR BOTH SIDES.  LUCA </p><p>FERRARI, THE MFA\'S OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR ISRAEL AND PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRITORIES WHO ATTENDED THE MEETING WITH FM FRATTINI, </p><p>DESCRIBED NETANYAHU\'S SPEECH AS "A LECTURE AT THE AMERICAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06094  201802Z </p><p>ENTREPRISE INSTITUTE," FULL OF HIS USUAL "CAMPAIGN PITCH" AND </p><p>A CLEARLY STATED POSITION THAT ISRAEL\'S PROBLEM IS PART OF A </p><p>WORLDWIDE MUSLIM TERRORISM PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) NETANYAHU TOLD AMB. SEMBLER THAT ISRAEL DEEPLY </p><p>APPRECIATED THE DRAMATIC CHANGE IN ITALY\'S RELATIONS WITH </p><p>ISRAEL SINCE BERLUSCONI TOOK OFFICE, AND THE MAJOR REDUCTION </p><p>IN ARAFAT\'S STANDING WITH ITALY IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS.  TO </p><p>ALL HIS ITALIAN INTERLOCUTORS, NETANYAHU SAID THAT, IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, ISRAEL IS THOUGHT OF AS THE "SMALL SATAN", THE </p><p>U.S. BEING THE "BIG SATAN."  NOW, ADDED NETANYAHU, ITALY IS </p><p>BECOMING THE "MEDIUM SATAN."  FERRARI SAID THE NEXT DAY THAT </p><p>THIS REMARK OF NETANYAHU\'S HAD HIT THE RIGHT CHORD WITH </p><p>ITALIAN OFFICIALS, WHO ARE AWARE OF THE RISKS BEING RUN BY </p><p>ITALY\'S ACTIVITIES TO DISRUPT TERRORIST OPERATIONS.  FERRARI </p><p>ADDED THAT NETANYAHU TOLD FRATTINI THAT ITALY IS ONE OF THE </p><p>FEW RELIABLE PARTNERS ISRAEL HAS WITHIN THE EU.  NETANYAHU </p><p>WAS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED WITH MOD MARTINO FOR HIS PROFOUND </p><p>KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND HIS COMMITMENT TO ACTIVELY </p><p>COMBAT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE ISRAELIS ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY </p><p>OF THE EU, DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2003, WILL BE FAR MORE </p><p>BALANCED THAN THE CURRENT DANISH PRESIDENCY.  IN FACT, EHUD </p><p>GOL, THE AMBASSADOR OF ISRAEL IN ROME, HAS BEEN LOBBYING THE </p><p>MFA AND WRITING OP-EDS AFTER EVERY SINGLE DANISH STATEMENT ON </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST.  FERRARI HOWEVER DID NOT HIDE HIS ANGER AT </p><p>THE "UTTERLY NONPROFESSIONAL" BEHAVIOR OF THE ISRAELI EMBASSY </p><p>EARLIER THIS MONTH WHEN IT QUOTED VERBATIM BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>STATEMENT, IN A PRIVATE MEETING WITH ISRAELI PRESIDENT KATSAV </p><p>DEC 11, THAT THE CHIGI (ITALY\'S PRIME MINISTERIAL PALACE) HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06094  201802Z </p><p>"CUT OFF ALL CONTACT WITH ARAFAT AND HIS REPRESENTATIVES" </p><p>AFTER THE KILLINGS OF 29 ISRAELIS ON MARCH 27. (IN FACT, </p><p>NABIL SHA\'ATH HAD BEEN IN THE CHIGI JUST DAYS BEFORE KATSAV). </p><p>FERRARI SAID THE ISRAELIS HAD SCORED A TEMPORARY PROPAGANDA </p><p>POINT, UNTIL THE PM\'S OFFICE WAS FORCED TO DENY THE </p><p>STATEMENT.  BUT THE RESULTING FUROR IN THE ITALIAN PRESS </p><p>WOULD NOW CONSTRAIN THE ITALIAN MFA\'S ABILITY TO STEER A MORE </p><p>BALANCED COURSE; ITS EVERY MOVE AND STATEMENT WOULD NOW BE </p><p>SCRUTINIZED MORE CLOSELY BY THE ARAFAT SYMPATHIZERS, WHO WERE </p><p>NUMEROUS NOT ONLY IN THE OPPOSITION, BUT WITHIN BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT COALITION.  POL MC SHARED FERRARI\'S ASTONISHMENT </p><p>THAT THE ISRAELIS NEVER EVEN APOLOGIZED FOR THE GAFFE. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME06094 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
