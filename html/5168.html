RANGOON 30 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 02 RANGOON 1468 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA a.i., Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Since last Fall, Burma has seen the formation </p><p>of new government economic advisory committees, a relatively </p><p>stable kyat, and slowing consumer price inflation.  Could </p><p>this mean the regime is finally taking real steps to improve </p><p>the economic situation?  Unfortunately not.  The exchange </p><p>rate stability is illusory, the slowing consumer price rises </p><p>mask a still rampant inflation rate.  As for the committees, </p><p>nothing good can come of them.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Government Committees: Training Grounds for Corruption </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) As a sign of its earnest efforts to remedy the </p><p>nation\'s economic woes, the regime established in September </p><p>several committees to monitor and advise on the nation\'s </p><p>economic crises.  These green ribbon committees, all chaired </p><p>by top SPDC members and military trustees, are ostensibly </p><p>looking at issues ranging from fuel conservation to commodity </p><p>price control.  While this seems encouraging, local </p><p>economists say that such a move is commonplace and rarely </p><p>turns into legitimate reform.  More likely, some opined, </p><p>these committees end up as training grounds for young </p><p>officers on how to take advantage of the country\'s economic </p><p>distortions for their own benefit. </p><p> </p><p>Exchange Rates: Pressure is Building </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Nonetheless, statistics collected by the Embassy </p><p>show a relatively stable dollar/kyat market exchange rate </p><p>over the past two months.  The kyat raced from 900 in August </p><p>to 1310 kyat/dollar in mid-September before plateauing at </p><p>about 1000 kyat/dollar from October through the end of 2002. </p><p>This value of the kyat is still lower than it was at the </p><p>beginning of 2002 (720 kyat/dollar), and is still 167 times </p><p>below the official rate (6 kyat/dollar).  However, it is </p><p>significant that such stability could come, and endure, </p><p>without any evident economic reforms or positive changes in </p><p>the business climate. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) As we reported in Ref B, this curious period of </p><p>stability is largely due to the government\'s decision to </p><p>remove a major distorting factor from the foreign exchange </p><p>market.  The military-directed Myanmar Economic Holdings, </p><p>Ltd. (MEHL), not required like other importers to cover their </p><p>import expenses with export revenues, had been a major </p><p>consumer of black market dollars to fund its exclusive right </p><p>to import diesel fuel and palm oil for cooking.  These import </p><p>privileges, unfortunately bred significant corruption and </p><p>higher prices.  Thus, the regime, in cooperation with MEHL\'s </p><p>new leadership, decided in late 2002 to crack down on MEHL </p><p>and re-assign the right to import diesel and cooking oil to </p><p>state-controlled entities.  This decision in a stroke reduced </p><p>significantly the demand for "uncovered" dollars on the open </p><p>market.  The government also periodically fine tunes the </p><p>exchange rate through "administrative measures" (e.g., </p><p>arresting large money changers). </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The government\'s increasing miserliness on the </p><p>granting of import licenses also helps to explain the </p><p>stability of the kyat.  Over the past several months, </p><p>importers have complained about regular GOB refusal of </p><p>license requests or extremely slow approval.  Also, they say, </p><p>even approved licenses are regularly for 50 percent less than </p><p>the amount requested.  Reflecting this, the recorded value of </p><p>imports fell throughout 2002 by about 35 percent, according </p><p>to official statistics. </p><p> </p><p>Prices: Consumer Goods Steady, but Inflation Roars </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Despite a drop in the official value of imports, </p><p>there has been no sharp rise in the cost of imported consumer </p><p>goods in Rangoon.  From October through December, the price </p><p>changes of our basket of imported consumer items have been </p><p>about the same, or in one case lower, than the overall </p><p>monthly CPI increase, which itself has slowed over the past </p><p>three months.  The only significant increase in price in </p><p>December\'s basket came from cooking oil -- perhaps a reaction </p><p>to the new government-controlled importing and distribution </p><p>arrangement. </p><p>7. (C) A number of factors appear to explain this.  First, </p><p>importers tell us that they have kept their volume steady, </p><p>despite tighter import controls, by shifting their purchases </p><p>from better quality, more expensive Thai, Japanese, Korean, </p><p>and western products to cheaper Chinese goods.  Second, for </p><p>consumer goods a virile black market here has kept the supply </p><p>relatively steady, combined with some import substitution </p><p>(particularly in snack foods and dry noodles) and some dip in </p><p>demand commensurate with decreasing standards of living. </p><p>Finally, the import statistics may be somewhat misleading as </p><p>many importers underinvoice to bring in more product for </p><p>their dollar\'s worth of export revenue, covering themselves </p><p>by converting kyat earnings at the curbside market and moving </p><p>it offshore through the black market exchange system (hon </p><p>ti).  However, importers tell us that Customs has been </p><p>cracking down on this practice lately, unilaterally marking </p><p>up the invoice or requiring proof in the form of export </p><p>records from the country of origin. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Furthermore, broader inflation remains a serious </p><p>problem countrywide, especially when combined with stagnant </p><p>wages and the eroding value of the kyat.  We estimate the </p><p>rate for Rangoon in 2002 at about 60 percent.  One of the </p><p>most serious causes is excess money supply due to the Central </p><p>Bank\'s monetizing of chronic GOB budget deficits.  This, </p><p>combined with a weak banking sector and the depreciation of </p><p>the kyat, has led business people to unload kyat and snatch </p><p>up legal assets (especially real estate, cars, gold, and </p><p>gems) as fast as they can.  The resulting asset bubbles have </p><p>been exacerbated by the boom in informal financial </p><p>institutions that are investing in these same assets their </p><p>surprisingly large deposits (see Ref A).  The high cost of </p><p>transportation and imported fertilizer and tractors, combined </p><p>with supply and distribution problems have also kept rice </p><p>prices at historic high levels.  Likewise, the dysfunctional </p><p>distribution system for fuel has led to steep price hikes for </p><p>black market diesel and gasoline. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In short, there is little evidence that the recently </p><p>stabilized exchange rate has anything to do with any new </p><p>stability in the economy.  While regime policies imposing </p><p>tighter import controls and reining in the greedy MEHL have </p><p>helped economize on foreign exchange and have helped squeeze </p><p>out some corruption from the trading system, there has been </p><p>no real effort to deal with the excess liquidity generated by </p><p>the central government\'s budget deficit and the still </p><p>expanding operations of the unofficial financial </p><p>institutions.  Absent moves in these areas to deal with the </p><p>rapidly expanding money supply, there is little that tighter </p><p>enforcement of the GOB\'s current rules can do.  As a </p><p>consequence, most people are still looking to a sharp </p><p>increase in the exchange rate this spring.  Eighteen months </p><p>ago, we forecast an exchange rate of 1800-2000 kyat/dollar by </p><p>the end of Burmese FY 2002-03 (March 31).  Now it appears </p><p>that the exchange rate may come in at the low end of that </p><p>range, but even that will represent a near doubling of the </p><p>exchange rate against the dollar in one year -- not in any </p><p>sense a sign of a stabilizing economy.  End comment. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
