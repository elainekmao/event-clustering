(C) SUMMARY: THE PRIVATE SECTOR INITIATIVE (PSI) IS AN </p><p>ALTERNATE LAND ACQUISITION, RESETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PLAN THAT IS BEING QUIETLY PROMOTED AS A COMPLEMENTARY </p><p>APPROACH TO THE GOZ\'S "FAST TRACK" PROGRAM.  IT CALLS FOR </p><p>THE CREATION OF AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT GUARANTEE BANK </p><p>FUNDED BY COMMERCIAL BANKS, THE GOZ AND DONOR COUNTRIES. </p><p>ITS AIM IS TO PURCHASE COMMERCIAL FARMS FROM WILLING </p><p>SELLERS AT MARKET RATES (THE PROGRAM TARGET IS 200 FARMS), </p><p>TO PAY FOR BOTH THE LAND AND IMPROVEMENTS, AND TO RESETTLE </p><p>THE LAND WITH ABLE AND QUALIFIED INDIGENOUS FARMERS WHO </p><p>WILL PURSUE COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE ON A SMALL OR MEDIUM </p><p>SCALE.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE NEW OWNERS WOULD </p><p>GET A TRANSFERABLE OWNERSHIP OR LEASEHOLD INTEREST IN THE </p><p>PROPERTY ALONG WITH SUBSIDIZED FINANCING (A 20 YEAR, 15 </p><p>PERCENT FIXED MORTGAGE), AND WOULD HAVE TO PRODUCE AND </p><p>MARKET A SALEABLE CROP.  THE TOTAL SIZE OF THE PROGRAM IN </p><p>FINANCIAL TERMS IS ABOUT U.S. $40 MILLION DOLLARS (OR Z </p><p>$2.25 BILLION) SPLIT AS FOLLOWS: U.S. $2 MILLION EQUIVALENT </p><p>FROM LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; U.S. $11 MILLION FROM A </p><p>LONG-TERM GOZ BOND ISSUE; U.S. $7.3 MILLION FROM DONORS TO </p><p>PAY FOR THE LAND (PERHAPS THE BRITISH?); AND ADDITIONAL </p><p>DONOR CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALLING U.S. $21 MILLION.  WHILE THE </p><p>PLAN IS WORTHWHILE AND BASED ON FREE-MARKET PRINCIPLES AND </p><p>GEARED TO SUCCESSFUL LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT, IT FACES </p><p>NUMEROUS OBSTACLES, BOTH POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE: THE RULING PARTY NEEDS TO REORIENT ITS SUPPORT </p><p>FROM SOCIALIST TO FREE-MARKET PRINCIPLES; THE DONORS HAVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00743  01 OF 02  131436Z </p><p>TO COME ON BOARD IN A VERY BIG WAY; AND A DIVERSE GROUP OF </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS NEEDS TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM WITH A FREE </p><p>HAND AND WITHOUT GOZ INTERFERENCE AND CORRUPTION.  IN THE </p><p>CURRENT AND FORESEEABLE NEAR TERM ENVIRONMENT, THE ODDS OF </p><p>SUCH A CONFLUENCE ARE, IN OUR OPINION, QUITE SMALL.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>WHO IS BEHIND THE INITIATIVE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE INITIATIVE WAS CONCEIVED AND IS BEING PROMOTED </p><p>BY A COMMERCIAL BANKER (GREG BRACKENRIDGE, MANAGING </p><p>DIRECTOR, STANBIC BANK ZIMBABWE) AND A COMMERCIAL FARMER </p><p>(NICK SWANEPOEL, THE PRIOR COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) </p><p>PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE LAND ISSUE </p><p>SINCE BEFORE THE SEPTEMBER 1998 DONOR\'S LAND CONFERENCE). </p><p>IT AIMS TO PURCHASE AND RESETTLE A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT </p><p>OF LAND (200 FARMS V.S. THE GOVERNMENT\'S CURRENT GOAL OF </p><p>3,000, OR ABOUT 350,000 HECTARES V.S. THE GOZ GOAL OF 5 </p><p>MILLION) USING A SUBSIDIZED, COMMERCIALLY-DRIVEN FINANCE </p><p>STRUCTURE.  THE PROGRAM INTENDS TO UTILIZE EXISTING </p><p>AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT TECHNIQUES THAT THE </p><p>CFU HAS ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED IN ITS OWN SMALL </p><p>PROGRAMS AIMED AT HELPING INDIGENOUS FARMERS WORK THE LAND </p><p>ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS (SUCH AS THE FARMER\'S DEVELOPMENT </p><p>TRUST). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE PROGRAM GOES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT\'S GRAIN IN </p><p>THAT IT GIVES TITLE TO THE RESETTLED FARMERS (AND IN TURN </p><p>GREATER POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE), APPLIES THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00743  01 OF 02  131436Z </p><p>SAME STANDARDS AND RULES TO ALL (I.E. THAT OF THE </p><p>MARKETPLACE), REQUIRES PAYMENT FOR THE LAND BY THOSE WHO </p><p>ACQUIRE IT, AND DEMANDS PERFORMANCE, RESULTS AND </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE NEW OCCUPANTS, WITH BANKRUPTCY AS THE </p><p>ALTERNATIVE.  IN ESSENCE, IT ROLLS OUT ON A SMALL SCALE </p><p>WHAT THE WHITE, ZIMBABWEAN COMMERCIAL FARMERS DO NOW. </p><p>GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT\'S USE OF THE LAND ISSUE TO ACHIEVE ITS </p><p>POLITICAL AND POWER RETENTION GOALS, WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO GET THE GOZ BACKING NEEDED FOR THE INITIATIVE </p><p>TO BE SUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>THE STRUCTURE AND OBJECTIVES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE PSI WOULD ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>AGRICULTURAL CREDIT-GUARANTEE AGENCY, SIMILAR TO OUR EX-IM </p><p>BANK, THAT WOULD PROVIDE SUBSIDIZED FINANCING FOR LAND </p><p>PURCHASES AND CREDIT BACKING TO THE COMMERCIAL BANKING </p><p>SECTOR FOR ONGOING FARM FINANCING AND DEVELOPMENT.  ITS </p><p>INITIAL BUDGET OF ZIM $2.25 BILLION (ABOUT U.S. $40 </p><p>MILLION) WOULD BE ABOUT TWO-THIRDS FINANCED OR PROVIDED BY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0618 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00743  02 OF 02  131436Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  STR-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------C513C1  131450Z /38 </p><p>R 131427Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8224 </p><p>INFO USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000743 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/EPS, AF/S, EB/IFD/ODF </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER, BARAK HOFFMAN </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.

THE GOZ WOULD FLOAT A BOND (RAISING </p><p>U.S. $11 MILLION EQUIVALENT) AND PROVIDE AN OVERALL CREDIT </p><p>GUARANTEE TO THE CREDIT AGENCY.  THE DONORS, IN ADDITION TO </p><p>FUNDING, WOULD PROVIDE EXPERTISE AND SOME DEGREE OF </p><p>STAFFING SUPPORT.  (EMBASSY COMMENT: THE WORTH OF A </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE THESE DAYS IS, AT BEST, </p><p>QUESTIONABLE.  OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE GUARANTEE </p><p>INSULATES THE PRIVATE FINANCIAL SECTOR FROM ANY POTENTIAL </p><p>LOSSES, PROVIDING IT CAN BE DRAWN ON AND, THEREFORE, MAKES </p><p>THIS AN ALL GAIN-NO PAIN EXERCISE FOR THE BANKERS.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE OBJECTIVES, IN GENERAL TERMS, ARE TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT AT A LEAST A PORTION OF THE CURRENT LAND RESETTLEMENT </p><p>EXERCISE IS CONDUCTED ALONG CAPITALIST, FREE-MARKET </p><p>PRINCIPLES, AND PROPERTY RIGHTS, INDIVIDUAL EMPOWERMENT AND </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY, AND PROFIT AND LOSS FROM AGRICULTURAL </p><p>OPERATIONS ALL APPLY.  THE INITIATIVES BACKER\'S STATED </p><p>GOALS ARE: </p><p> </p><p>= TO PROVIDE AND EFFICIENT CONDUIT FOR FUNDING LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT; </p><p>= TO FUND THE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMS IN AN EFFECTIVE, </p><p>FISCALLY SOUND AND MACRO-ECONOMICALLY STABILIZING MANNER; </p><p>= TO ENCOURAGE AND PROMOTE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>SCHEMES IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE RESOURCES OF MULTILATERAL, </p><p>BILATERAL AND NGO ORGANIZATIONS; </p><p>= TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURAL RESETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>PROVIDE A REAL ECONOMIC RETURN TO THE INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00743  02 OF 02  131436Z </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN THE CURRENT POLITICALLY-DRIVEN LAND-ISSUE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT, WHERE DARK FORCES AND BEHIND-THE-SCENES </p><p>MANEUVERINGS AND DEALS ARE COMMONPLACE, THE INITIATIVE IS </p><p>AN ANOMALOUS ORPHAN.  ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE CFU\'S MEMBERSHIP </p><p>ARE STRONGLY AGAINST ANY NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ON THE LAND ISSUE, A FORMER CFU PRESIDENT IS PROMOTING IT. </p><p>THE OFFICIAL LINE ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE, TOO, IS THAT </p><p>NEGOTIATING WITH THE WHITE FARMERS IS TABOO.  THEREFORE, </p><p>ANY REAL MOVEMENT ON THE INITIATIVE WILL TAKE PLACE BEHIND </p><p>CLOSED DOORS.  IN ADDITION, THE PROPOSAL ENVISIONS THAT A </p><p>BULK OF THE PLANNED FUNDING COME FROM THE DONORS (ABOUT 70 </p><p>PERCENT OF U.S. $41 MILLION).  GIVEN THE CURRENT </p><p>ENVIRONMENT (CONTINUED VIOLENCE, ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY, </p><p>SUSPENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE LIKE), AND THE STATE </p><p>OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE DONOR COMMUNITY AND ZIMBABWE, IT </p><p>IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW SUCH FUNDING CAN OCCUR.  WE ALSO </p><p>POINT OUT THAT THE ACREAGE OF THE PROGRAM IS LESS THAN 10 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE GOZ\'S STATED ACQUISITION GOALS, AND FRANKLY </p><p>ASK IF SUCH EFFORTS AT THE MARGIN ARE WORTH THE REQUIRED </p><p>EFFORT?  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD, HOWEVER, THAT MOVEMENT CHANGING </p><p>THE THRUST AND METHODOLOGY OF THE CURRENT FAST-TRACK LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM MAY BE AFOOT AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS </p><p>HERE, AND WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT SOME MEASURES OF JUSTICE </p><p>AND SANITY ARE REINTRODUCED.  IF THAT BECOMES THE CASE, </p><p>PERHAPS THEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR INITIATIVE WILL BECOME MORE </p><p>ATTRACTIVE AND DOABLE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00743  02 OF 02  131436Z </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
