<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005966 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PPD, IIP/T/GIC-GSTEELE, IIP/T/PS </p><p>- TERRY SCOTT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SCUL PROP JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PROGRAM REQUEST: PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE </p><p>JORDANIAN MEDIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 07718 99, AMMAN 05986 00, AMMAN 07718  01 </p><p> </p><p>1.   This is an action request for IIP.  See para 6 </p><p> </p><p>2.   In view of the success to date of Embassy Amman\'s </p><p>"Media Professionalization Program," which has had a </p><p>visible impact on the quality of the work of a number </p><p>of Jordanian journalists, Amman seeks the Department\'s </p><p>assistance in continuing the program and developing a </p><p>new series of workshops for FY 2003.  Proposed workshop </p><p>topics are intended to raise the professional standard </p><p>of Jordanian journalists and serve mission objectives </p><p>by encouraging continued engagement with local media. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Justification: more than ten years into its </p><p>declared process of democratization, Jordan has not yet </p><p>resolved the classic dilemma: how to allow a greater </p><p>degree of media freedom while maintaining control in an </p><p>often unpredictable political environment.  During the </p><p>past year alone the government enacted a new emergency </p><p>amendment to the press and publications law, created </p><p>then froze the Higher Media Council, and announced then </p><p>abandoned plans to eliminate the Ministry Of </p><p>Information. All this reflects the importance and </p><p>timeliness of the issue of media freedom in Jordan. </p><p>But real progress towards press freedom is only </p><p>possible in the context of a skilled and responsible </p><p>press.  Jordan\'s journalists suffer from low pay and </p><p>poor command of English, which prevent them from </p><p>accessing available resources for research and </p><p>reporting, a lack of relevant training and education, </p><p>and little to no experience of international standards </p><p>of reporting. </p><p> </p><p>4.   PA Amman plans to conduct a series of three </p><p>speaker/specialist programs, each lasting approximately </p><p>3-4 days.  The workshops would take place during the </p><p>period December 2002-April 2003.  The target audience </p><p>is working mid-career or junior Jordanian journalists. </p><p>American workshop leaders would be accomplished </p><p>journalists with field experience rather than pure </p><p>academics.  We have found it effective to locate high </p><p>caliber specialists and use translation rather than </p><p>rely on a limited pool of Arabic speaking specialists, </p><p>though a qualified Arabic speaker would always be </p><p>welcome. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Specific program topics: post would like to </p><p>propose the following topics for the three programs. </p><p>IIP project officer and post program officer can expand </p><p>on the titles together via e-mail. </p><p> </p><p>--   Feature/ analytical writing. </p><p>Mission objective: Promoting better analytical skills, </p><p>and hence a more accurate and balanced presentation of </p><p>U.S. policies. </p><p>Skills: Learning the difference between analysis and </p><p>opinion writing.  How to research a feature article, </p><p>with emphasis on understanding the need for various </p><p>viewpoints in developing an accurate picture of the </p><p>subject matter.  The difference between writing a news </p><p>report, an analytical article, and an opinion piece. </p><p>Desired date: December 2002 </p><p> </p><p>--   Credibility in reporting </p><p>Mission objective: promoting higher professional </p><p>standards in journalism. </p><p>Skills: the need to check and double-check information, </p><p>quoting sources accurately, respecting the difference </p><p>between information given on the record, off the </p><p>record, or on background, resisting the temptation to </p><p>insert subjective opinion in a straight reporting piece </p><p>when addressing questions to an interviewee. </p><p>Desired date: February 2003 </p><p> </p><p>--   Covering Elections. </p><p>Mission objective: promoting democracy. </p><p>Skills: polling, analyzing election issues, and </p><p>analyzing candidates\' and parties\' election strategies. </p><p>Note:  This workshop would be particularly effective in </p><p>April 2003, since Jordan has officially announced that </p><p>parliamentary elections would be held in Spring 2003, </p><p>which it defined as extending till the end of June. </p><p>Desired date: April 2003 </p><p> </p><p>6.   Post seeks assistance in identifying speakers, </p><p>establishing initial contact with them, and arranging </p><p>the logistics of their visit to Amman.  We welcome </p><p>arranging these programs in coordination with other </p><p>posts in the region to reduce costs to individual </p><p>posts.  Materials are extremely important for the kind </p><p>of participatory workshops envisioned.  When chosen, </p><p>speakers/specialists should be asked to forward to PA </p><p>select handout materials and books for use in their </p><p>sessions (materials available electronically can be </p><p>downloaded and prepared locally at post).  Post- </p><p>translated and produced materials can also be made </p><p>available to other posts, if desired. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Program officer is: Information Officer Justin </p><p>Siberell.  Contact information: (Tel.) 962-6-592-0101 </p><p>x2618; (Fax) 962-6-5928932; (E-mail) </p><p>jsiberell@pd.state.gov </p><p>Post thanks IIP in advance.  GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
