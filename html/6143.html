<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001336 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN SCHEDULES PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS FOR JUNE </p><p>17 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM DOUGLAS SILLIMAN, REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 27 THAT </p><p>LOWER HOUSE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, POSTPONED THREE TIMES, </p><p>WILL BE HELD ON JUNE 17.  THE GOVERNMENT FURTHER ANNOUNCED </p><p>THAT MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED FOR JULY 5 </p><p>WOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL JULY 26 TO ALLOW FOR A PRUDENT AMOUNT </p><p>OF TIME BETWEEN THE TWO ELECTION DATES.  MOST POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES WELCOMED THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT AND VIEWED THE </p><p>KING\'S DECISION AS A VERY POSITIVE STEP. THE ISLAMIC ACTION </p><p>FRONT (IAF), JORDAN\'S LARGEST OPPOSITION PARTY, SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT MERELY SETTING A DATE FOR ELECTIONS DID NOT GO FAR </p><p>ENOUGH AND CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO INTRODUCE AN ELECTIONS </p><p>LAW GUARANTEEING EQUAL REPRESENTATION TO ALL SEGMENTS OF </p><p>SOCIETY AND DECIDING WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPERVISING </p><p>THE ENTIRE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  WE BELIEVE THE KING WANTS TO </p><p>MOVE AHEAD WITH ELECTIONS IN JUNE, UNLESS THERE IS SERIOUS </p><p>INSTABILITY IN THE REGION. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>FOURTH TIME\'S THE CHARM? </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE KING DISSOLVED THE LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT IN </p><p>JUNE 2001. THE CONSTITUTION CALLS FOR NEW ELECTIONS WITHIN </p><p>FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE PARLIAMENT UNLESS </p><p>THERE ARE COMPELLING CIRCUMSTANCES DEEMED TO IMPEDE ON THE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS. THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED ON THREE PREVIOUS </p><p>OCCASIONS GENERAL TIME PERIODS FOR NEW ELECTIONS, YET NEVER </p><p>SET SPECIFIC DATES TO HOLD THEM, AND EVENTUALLY POSTPONED </p><p>THEM EACH TIME.  THUS FAR, MANY OF THE KINGDOM\'S POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES HAVE REACTED POSITIVELY YET CAUTIOUSLY TO THE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT.  MOST VIEW THE GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION AS A VERY </p><p>POSITIVE STEP, YET ARE SKEPTICAL THAT ELECTIONS WILL ACTUALLY </p><p>TAKE PLACE GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES REACT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AMONG THE MOST VOCAL OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES REACTING </p><p>TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S ANNOUNCEMENT WAS THE IAF, THE POLITICAL </p><p>ARM OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, WHICH BOYCOTTED THE 1997 </p><p>ELECTIONS.  IN A MARCH 2ND PRESS INTERVIEW, IAF SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL HAMZA MANSOUR STATED, "THERE ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS </p><p>TO CONSIDER BEFORE SETTING A DATE, INCLUDING CHARTING A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS LAW AND DECIDING WHO SHOULD SUPERVISE </p><p>THE PROCESS."  THE IAF IS A STRONG OPPONENT OF THE "ONE MAN </p><p>ONE VOTE" FORMULA OF THE CURRENT ELECTIONS LAW, FAVORING </p><p>INSTEAD THE INTRODUCTION OF A PROPORTIONAL LIST THAT WOULD </p><p>PROVIDE THE IAF--JORDAN\'S ONLY ORGANIZED NATIONWIDE POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY--WITH A GREATER CHANCE OF SUCCESS IN ELECTIONS </p><p>(ADDITIONAL DETAILS SEPTEL).  MORE CENTRIST PARTIES, BY </p><p>CONTRAST, ENTHUSIASTICALLY WELCOMED THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT AND URGED JORDANIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>UPCOMING DEMOCRATIC ELECTORAL PROCESS.  POST CONTACTS VIEWED </p><p>THE DECISION AS POSITIVE FOR BOTH JORDAN AND FOR THE KING, </p><p>BUT ALSO EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN THAT A WAR IN IRAQ COULD LEAD </p><p>THE GOJ TO POSTPONE ELECTIONS AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE GOVERNMENT EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN MEETING WITH </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES TO DISCUSS THEIR RESPECTIVE CONCERNS BUT </p><p>INSISTS THAT THE CURRENT ELECTION FORMULA--ONE MAN-ONE VOTE </p><p>IN SINGLE MEMBER CONSTITUENCIES--IS FAIR, EFFECTIVE, AND WILL </p><p>NOT CHANGE.  THE IAF INDICATED THAT IT WILL SOON ANNOUNCE </p><p>WHETHER IT INTENDS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE JUNE ELECTIONS OR </p><p>BOYCOTT THEM FOR A SECOND TIME. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) OVERALL, THE KING\'S DECISION TO SET AN ELECTION DATE </p><p>IS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT SINCE MANY POST CONTACTS WERE </p><p>PREDICTING A FOURTH POSTPONEMENT DUE TO THE FACT THAT  THE </p><p>KING AND GOVERNMENT CHOSE TO HOLD THE ELECTIONS IN MID JUNE </p><p>INDICATES THAT IT HAS FACTORED THE IRAQ WAR INTO ITS </p><p>CALCULATIONS AND HOPES THAT BY THEN THE WAR WOULD BE OVER, </p><p>TEMPERS WILL HAVE CALMED, AND THE ELECTIONS CAN PROCEED AS </p><p>PLANNED.  WE BELIEVE THE KING WANTS TO MOVE AHEAD AS </p><p>ANNOUNCED, AND WILL DO SO UNLESS THERE IS SERIOUS INSTABILITY </p><p>IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ALTHOUGH THE IAF HAS YET TO ANNOUNCE WHETHER THEY </p><p>INTEND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE JUNE ELECTIONS, FEW EXPECT THEM </p><p>TO ANNOUNCE A BOYCOTT AND RISK AGAIN BEING LEFT OUT OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL PROCESS.  THE GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH AMENABLE TO </p><p>LISTENING TO THEIR CONCERNS REGARDING THE ELECTIONS LAW, IS </p><p>UNLIKELY TO ALTER THE STATUS QUO--WHICH EFFECTIVELY LIMITS </p><p>THE IAF\'S ABILITY TO WIN PARLIAMENTARY SEATS. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
