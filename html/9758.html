<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 002149 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE, NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; NORTH KOREA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "Bush can\'t afford to go it alone" </p><p>Columnist Carol Goar commented in the liberal Toronto </p><p>Star (7/25): "On the one hand, there\'s pride. It would </p><p>be humiliating for U.S. President George Bush, who </p><p>dismissed the United Nations as ineffectual and </p><p>irrelevant just four months ago, to turn to the </p><p>international body for help now. On the other hand, </p><p>there\'s politics. The president\'s approval ratings are </p><p>slipping. Iraq has become a dangerous morass. Without </p><p>money and troops from other countries, the U.S. stands </p><p>little chance of stabilizing - let alone rebuilding - </p><p>the hostile country it now occupies. At United Nations </p><p>headquarters in New York, diplomats from around the </p><p>world wait and weigh the odds. This could be the </p><p>organization\'s best chance to prove that it is still </p><p>capable of global problem solving. Or it could be a </p><p>historic lost opportunity.... [I]n practical terms, </p><p>Washington does have to go back to the U.N. if it wants </p><p>help.... Bush has a choice to make. He can continue to </p><p>flex his muscles on the world stage, with the support </p><p>of a few embattled allies such as Britain\'s Tony Blair. </p><p>Or he can admit he is in trouble. Both options have </p><p>their risks.... Still, Bush\'s best bet, by any rational </p><p>analysis, would </p><p>be to swallow hard and ask for help. Even a superpower </p><p>can\'t bring peace to a resentful, violence-ridden </p><p>country.... It is unlikely that Bush will ever embrace </p><p>the notion of multilateral engagement. Most of the </p><p>time, the world needs America more than America needs </p><p>the world. Nor is it probable thatBush will return to </p><p>the United Nations willingly or contritely. The </p><p>president of the United States doesn\'t bend or beg. But </p><p>if Bush is smart - or if his chief political </p><p>strategist, Karl Rove, is as shrewd as people say </p><p>- he will agree to a new U.N. resolution on post-war </p><p>Iraq. There are timeswhen pragmatism trumps pride." </p><p> </p><p>NORTH KOREA </p><p>2.   "Mad moves" </p><p>Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le </p><p>Devoir (7/25): "Kim Jong-il demands...that the U.S. </p><p>sign a pact of non-aggression, guarantee the continuity </p><p>of the regime, which would mean granting impunity to </p><p>the dictator and accept the principle that negotiations </p><p>be conducted exclusively between Pyongyang and </p><p>Washington. According to the signals sent by the Bush </p><p>administration, the pact of non-aggression poses no </p><p>problem. The rest however does.  Since the renewal of </p><p>verbal hostilities between the two countries, </p><p>Washington has always favored, and rightly so, regional </p><p>talks. President Bush is adamant about South Korea, </p><p>Japan, Russia and especially China being present at the </p><p>negotiation table.... In order to try to conciliate the </p><p>one-on-one Korea wants with the multilateralism </p><p>Washington wants, China is proposing to mix bilateral </p><p>meetings with multilateral discussions. One wonders if </p><p>Chinese diplomacy is not closer to a labyrinth than to </p><p>common sense. All that remains for us to do is to </p><p>wonder if the fears expressed by the former Defense </p><p>Secretary William Perry are founded or not. The latter </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>said he was certain Korea would have eight nuclear </p><p>bombs by the end of the year. If that is the case then </p><p>the goose is cooked and has been cooked to the bone by </p><p>a mad chef." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
