<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008932 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR E, EUR/SE AND EB/TPP </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LECHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI/BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, PREL, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKS RAISE ISSUE OF FUTURE TRADE WITH IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Robert Deutsch.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Foreign Trade Under Secretary Tuncer Kayalar told us </p><p>December 11 that, in the event of a military operation in </p><p>Iraq, Turkey would seek USG and United Nations support for </p><p>some kind of preferred trade status to enable it to re-start </p><p>exports to Iraq quickly and on a large scale.  He argued that </p><p>such a status would help make up for the trade losses Turkey </p><p>has suffered since 1991 and would expect to suffer in the </p><p>event of a military operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Kayalar was not clear on exactly what Turkey would be </p><p>looking for, but suggested the UN could provide Turkey with </p><p>preferred status that would enable it to export humanitarian </p><p>goods during an operation (he mentioned Article 50 status in </p><p>this context) and a broader range of goods and services after </p><p>an operation.  He explained that the GOT assumed some kind of </p><p>international authority would control a post-operation Iraq </p><p>for a lengthy period, and would be able to -- in effect -- </p><p>direct contracts to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Kayalar noted that State Minister Ali Babacan and </p><p>others had focused on Turkey\'s financial difficulties and </p><p>needs in the event of an operation, but suggested that </p><p>support for Turkey on the trade side would also be important. </p><p> We responded that any discussion at this point would be </p><p>highly speculative, but pointed to U.S.-Turkish cooperation </p><p>on Afghan reconstruction as an indication of how our two </p><p>governments could facilitate successful business partnerships </p><p>in previously off-limits countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment:  Kayalar and his boss, State Minister </p><p>Kursad Tuzmen, are strong advocates of Turkey developing </p><p>stronger trade relations with its neighbors, including Iraq. </p><p>We would expect this initial pitch by Kayalar to turn into a </p><p>steady drumbeat as the GOT presses its case for preferential </p><p>treatment.  In fact, Turkey is well-placed on its own to take </p><p>full economic advantage of the economic opportunities that </p><p>would arise should Iraq return to the international </p><p>community. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
