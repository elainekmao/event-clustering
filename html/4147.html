END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM L. SWING, SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF </p><p>THE UN SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR MINURSO ADDRESSED DONORS ON </p><p>OCTOBER 25 AT WFP HEADQUARTERS. HE DESCRIBED A DRAMATIC </p><p>SITUATION WHERE SOME 155,000 REFUGEES FROM WESTERN SAHARA, </p><p>LIVING IN FOUR ISOLATED QUARTER-CENTURY OLD CAMPS IN THE </p><p>INHOSPITABLE TINDOUF REGION, RELY HEAVILY ON WFP FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE. THEY HAVE ACCESS TO FEW OTHER SOURCES OF FOOD. </p><p>THESE CAMPS ARE IN EXCEEDINGLY ARID ZONES WHERE LITTLE </p><p>FLOURISHES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO EARN AN INCOME ARE SCARCE. </p><p>THE STALLED UN-SPONSORED SETTLEMENT PLAN HAS QUASHED HOPES </p><p>FOR A SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF THEIR PLIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>3. AMBASSADOR SWING COMMENTED THAT ERRATIC FOOD DELIVERIES </p><p>AND INCOMPLETE FOOD BASKETS HAVE DRAMATIC EFFECTS ON THE </p><p>NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF VULNERABLE BENEFICIARIES, PARTICULARLY </p><p>PREGNANT AND NURSING WOMEN. CALORIC INTAKE AMONG </p><p>BENEFICIARIES DROPS AS LOW AS 1,288 KILOCALORIES WHEN </p><p>RESOURCES ARE INSUFFICIENT - SUCH AS OCCURRED IN JANUARY </p><p>2002. NOTE: A JOINT WFP/UNHCR NUTRITIONAL SURVEY IS BEING </p><p>CONDUCTED TO DOCUMENT LEVELS OF MALNUTRITION AND VITAMIN </p><p>DEFICIENCIES AMONG THE REFUGEE POPULATION. THE SURVEY REPORT </p><p>IS EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED IN DECEMBER 2002. END NOTE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05360  01 OF 02  311632Z </p><p> </p><p>4. IT WAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT WFP HAS SPONSORED DONORS\' </p><p>VISITS TO THE TINDOUF CAMPS, IN FEBRUARY 2001 AND AGAIN IN </p><p>APRIL 2002, WITH A TOTAL PARTICIPATION OF EIGHTEEN EMBASSIES </p><p>AND THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY\'S HUMANITARIAN OFFICE (ECHO). AND </p><p>WFP RECENTLY OPENED A SUB-OFFICE IN TINDOUF. NOTE: THE </p><p>UNITED STATES HAS SUPPORTED A STEPPED-UP UNHCR/WFP PRESENCE </p><p>IN TINDOUF, INCLUDING POST-DISTRIBUTION MONITORING TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT WFP FOOD AID REMAINS WITH THE REFUGEES AND IS USED </p><p>STRICTLY FOR HUMANITARIAN PURPOSES. AN ENHANCED UN PRESENCE </p><p>WILL ALSO FURNISH THE REFUGEE POPULATIONS WITH A BETTER </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR RIGHTS AND THEIR OPTIONS FOR DURABLE </p><p>SOLUTIONS. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>5. IN ADDITION TO UNHCR AND WFP, THERE ARE SOME 19 NON- </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) - TWO ALGERIAN, 16 </p><p>EUROPEAN AND ONE FROM THE UNITED STATES - OPERATING </p><p>COMPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN THE CAMPS. </p><p> </p><p>6. A JOINT WFP/UNHCR APPEAL WAS ISSUED IN GENEVA ON AUGUST </p><p>28 TO FURTHER ALERT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF THE REFUGEES AND TO SENSITIZE DONORS </p><p>TO THE LOOMING FOOD CRISIS IN THE COMING MONTHS. NOTE: ONLY </p><p>ONE DONATION (FROM ITALY), AMOUNTING TO 2,322 MT, HAS BEEN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4759 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05360  02 OF 02  311632Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  INL-00   WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   M-00 </p><p>      NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   PER-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  ECA-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------0198D5  311825Z /38 </p><p>P 311527Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6719 </p><p>USDA WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ALGIERS </p><p>AMEMBASSY CAIRO </p><p>AMEMBASSY RABAT </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2910 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005360 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR A/S PRM DEWEY, A/S AFR KANSTEINER, IO ACTING A/S </p><p>WOOD, NEA/ENA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05360  02 OF 02  311632Z </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, DCHA/FFP </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, RTILSWORTH AND LREICH </p><p>NSC FOR JWDORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, AORC, WFP, UN, PREF, EAGR, EU </p><p>SUBJECT: WESTERN SAHARAN REFUGEES IMPERILED BY LACK OF FOOD </p><p>AID - BRIEFING BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM SWING, SPECIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UN SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR MINURSO </p><p> </p><p>MADE TO DATE. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>7. APPROXIMATELY 12,200 METRIC TONS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET THE </p><p>REFUGEES\' FOOD NEEDS BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE 2003. MONTHLY </p><p>REQUIREMENTS ARE ABOUT 2,800 METRIC TONS (TO PROVIDE 2,144 </p><p>KILOCALORIES PER PERSON PER DAY). THIS COSTS USD 1.25 </p><p>MILLION/MONTH. NOTE: THE TWO-YEAR WFP PROTRACTED RELIEF AND </p><p>RECOVERY OPERATION (PRRO) IS VALUED AT USD 29.7 MILLION </p><p>COVERING THE PERIOD SEPTEMBER 1, 2002 - AUGUST 31, 2004. </p><p>ECHO IS ALSO PROVIDING APPROXIMATELY USD 14 MILLION OVER A </p><p>15-MONTH PERIOD IN NON-FOOD AND MICRO-PROJECT SUPPORT. END </p><p>NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>8. GIVEN LACK OF PLEDGES, THE FOOD PIPELINE IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>BREAK IN FEBRUARY 2003. THE CEREALS SHORTFALL IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>STAND AT 73 PERCENT; SUPPLIES OF OIL, SUGAR AND SALT WILL BE </p><p>COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED. IN TOTAL, ONLY 31 PERCENT OF THE FOOD </p><p>BASKET WILL BE AVAILABLE, WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE REFUGEES </p><p>WITH ONLY 650 KCALS/DAY. CONFIRMATION OF CONTRIBUTIONS NOW </p><p>WOULD ENABLE THE WFP COUNTRY OFFICE TO BORROW FROM BUFFER </p><p>STOCKS IN THE COUNTRY TO AVOID A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05360  02 OF 02  311632Z </p><p>PIPELINE. IMMEDIATE AID (DECEMBER-MARCH), PREFERABLY IN </p><p>CASH, WHICH WOULD PERMIT PURCHASES IN THE REGION, IS </p><p>REQUIRED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. AMBASSADOR BILL SWING HAS HAD A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED </p><p>FOREIGN SERVICE CAREER AND IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF OUR HANDFUL </p><p>OF "WISE MEN" ON AFRICA. HE CLEARLY VIEWS A SUFFICIENTLY </p><p>SUBSCRIBED AND PREDICTABLE SUPPLY OF WFP FOOD AID AS A VITAL </p><p>ELEMENT IN MOVING THE POLITICAL PROCESS FORWARD - AS IT </p><p>DEMONSTRATES TO THE RESPECTIVE PARTIES THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY\'S UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO A PERMANENT POLITICAL </p><p>SOLUTION. IN THIS REGARD HE NOTED THAT SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RESOLUTION 1429 (JULY 30, 2002) CALLED INTER ALIA FOR </p><p>SUPPORT TO WFP\'S FOOD EFFORTS. HE URGED SOME PROMINENT EX- </p><p>DONORS (BELGIUM AND JAPAN) TO RE-JOIN THE FOOD AID EFFORT. </p><p>HE UNDERLINED THAT FOOD SHORTAGES ACT AS A DE-STABILIZING </p><p>FACTOR IN THE REFUGEE CAMPS AND IMPEDE CONFIDENCE BUILDING </p><p>MEASURES WITH THE CONCERNED PARTIES, BY LIMITING UN </p><p>LEVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p>8. USMISSION STRONGLY SUPPORTS AMBASSADOR SWING\'S APPEAL FOR </p><p>ENHANCED ASSISTANCE TO WFP\'S ALGERIA PRRO.
