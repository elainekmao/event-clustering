<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 002346 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, CE, USTR, CWC </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA: COMMERCE A/S LASH PUSHES INVESTMENT </p><p>CLIMATE ISSUES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  Following up on President Bush\'s July commitment </p><p>to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to examine areas for greater </p><p>economic engagement with Sri Lanka, William H. Lash III, </p><p>Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Market Access and </p><p>Compliance, brought a Commerce Department delegation to Sri </p><p>Lanka December 19-20 to assess areas for economic and </p><p>commercial engagement with the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL). </p><p>A/S Lash used his visit to press GSL to improve the investment </p><p>climate and to approve several pending proposals by U.S. </p><p>companies.  He delivered these messages during separate </p><p>meetings with Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Ravi </p><p>Karunanayake, Minister of Finance K.N. Choksy and Board of </p><p>Investment Chairman Arjunna Mahendran.  A/S Lash also engaged </p><p>leading business representatives to hear their concerns on Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s investment climate.  A press conference by A/S Lash led </p><p>to widespread coverage of the visit.  The visit succeeded in </p><p>focusing the GSL on steps it needs to take to strengthen its </p><p>trade and commercial ties with the U.S. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. William H. Lash III, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for </p><p>Market Access and Compliance, brought a Commerce Department </p><p>delegation to Sri Lanka December 19-20 to assess areas for </p><p>economic and commercial engagement with the Government of Sri </p><p>Lanka.  The Commerce Department delegation consisted of A/S </p><p>Lash; J.V. Schwan, Counselor to A/S Lash; Linda Droker, </p><p>Director for South Asia and Oceania; and Art Stern, India/Sri </p><p>Lanka Desk Officer. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Meeting with Minister of Commerce </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. A/S Lash met on December 20 with Minister of Commerce and </p><p>Consumer Affairs Ravi Karunanayake.  A/S Lash began by </p><p>explaining that his visit was a direct outcome of the </p><p>President\'s commitment to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, made </p><p>during their July meeting at the White House, to examine areas </p><p>for greater economic engagement with Sri Lanka.  The U.S. is </p><p>following closely Sri Lanka\'s economic reforms, he said.  Sri </p><p>Lanka had already pulled ahead of the rest of South Asia in </p><p>terms of openness and average standard of living, in spite of </p><p>years of conflict.  Now, with the prospects for peace stronger </p><p>than ever, the best way for Sri Lanka to attract foreign </p><p>investment, and thereby raise average income levels, is to </p><p>improve further its investment climate. </p><p> </p><p>4. A/S Lash went on to exhort Sri Lanka to become an example </p><p>within South Asia of sound IPR protection.  Effective IPR </p><p>protection, he said, was a key factor for U.S. companies when </p><p>evaluating countries for potential investment.  With many U.S. </p><p>firms considering technology and patents their greatest assets, </p><p>domestic protection of this property will be critical to Sri </p><p>Lanka attracting investments in knowledge-based industries such </p><p>as IT.  Karunanayake said that GSL has prepared TRIPS-compliant </p><p>IPR legislation that it expects to enact soon; the legislation </p><p>is currently before the Cabinet and will be debated in </p><p>Parliament in early February.  A/S Lash replied that </p><p>legislation was a good and necessary first step, but that </p><p>enforcement of IPR was equally important.  Many countries have </p><p>solid IPR legislation on the books, but fail in enforcing it; </p><p>Sri Lanka should set the regional standard for IPR not just in </p><p>word but in deed as well.  Karunanayake professed to understand </p><p>the need for enforcement, and asked for U.S. help in training </p><p>customs officials, police and judges; A/S Lash undertook to </p><p>examine areas for possible U.S. assistance. </p><p> </p><p>5. A/S Lash asked Karunanayake about the status of GSL\'s import </p><p>regulations on biotech foods.  While the U.S. was gratified </p><p>that Sri Lanka indefinitely delayed its proposed ban on biotech </p><p>food last year, we want to ensure that the Sri Lankan market </p><p>remain open to biotech foods.  Karunanayake assured A/S Lash </p><p>that the biotech ban would not return.  A/S Lash cautioned GSL </p><p>against adopting any mandatory labeling scheme for biotech </p><p>foods, pointing out that the U.S. objects strongly to any </p><p>requirement that manufacturers certify and disclose levels of </p><p>biotech content.  WTO rules call for trade regulations to be </p><p>based on science, and there is no scientific evidence to </p><p>warrant restrictions of any kind, including mandatory labeling, </p><p>on biotech foods.  Karunanayake again assured A/S Lash that Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s market would remain open to biotech foods, pledging </p><p>that Sri Lanka would not adopt a mandatory labeling scheme. </p><p> </p><p>6. A/S Lash also used the meeting with Karunanayake to press </p><p>the GSL to move forward with several pending U.S. commercial </p><p>projects.  He noted that Sri Lanka is interested in attracting </p><p>interest from more U.S. companies; the best way to do so is to </p><p>enlist champions of Sri Lanka in corporate America - companies </p><p>that have been successful doing business here and will </p><p>encourage others to invest as well.  A/S Lash raised </p><p>Caterpillar\'s proposal before GSL to provide 100 MW of power </p><p>generation; the U.S. expects a transparent process in awarding </p><p>the tender, and hopes that Caterpillar\'s project will be </p><p>approved.  A/S Lash also brought up Tamsco\'s signed contract </p><p>with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense to supply radar spares, </p><p>which has been held up now for over a year; the principle of </p><p>sanctity of contracts is at stake, and the U.S. expects GSL to </p><p>honor its obligations in this contract in a timely manner. </p><p>Finally, A/S Lash mentioned IMC Global\'s long-running proposal </p><p>to mine phosphate in Eppawela (north-central Sri Lanka), noting </p><p>that the project had the potential to be Sri Lanka\'s biggest- </p><p>ever foreign investment. </p><p> </p><p>7. A/S Lash noted that there are several sectors where U.S. </p><p>companies could pursue business in Sri Lanka.  Companies like </p><p>Caterpillar are already exploring the power sector, but there </p><p>are numerous other U.S. firms who could bring expertise to Sri </p><p>Lanka in the broader infrastructure sector.  IT is another area </p><p>where U.S. companies will likely show interest, provided they </p><p>can be assured of sound intellectual property protection.  In </p><p>addition, A/S Lash urged GSL to open up its educational system </p><p>to private institutions, noting the demonstrated competitive </p><p>advantage of the U.S. in this sector. </p><p> </p><p>8. Karunanayake inquired about the AFL-CIO\'s recent petition to </p><p>USTR to revoke Sri Lanka\'s GSP privileges.  (Note: The AFL- </p><p>CIO\'s petition asks for revocation of GSP for Sri Lanka based </p><p>on alleged restrictions on union activity in Export Processing </p><p>Zones here.  End Note.)  A/S Lash explained the background of </p><p>the GSP program and the role of the private sector and NGOs in </p><p>the certification process.  The U.S. government makes GSP </p><p>decisions on the basis of all relevant information, he said, </p><p>and it was impossible to predict what the outcome would be in </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s case. </p><p> </p><p>9. Karunanayake also asked for "swing" on quota items, noting </p><p>that keeping employment going in the apparel industry would be </p><p>critical to Sri Lanka\'s prospects for peace.  A/S Lash </p><p>explained the extreme difficulties in making any changes to the </p><p>quota system.  Many countries - including many very close U.S. </p><p>allies - have requested quota swing and come away empty-handed. </p><p>A/S Lash promised to look into the matter but made it clear he </p><p>was not optimistic. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Meeting with Minister of Finance </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. A/S Lash and Ambassador Wills met on December 20 with </p><p>Minister of Finance K.N. Choksy.  They discussed many of the </p><p>same themes A/S Lash covered above with the Minister of </p><p>Commerce, including the Caterpillar, Tamsco and IMC Global </p><p>proposals.  A/S Lash asked Choksy about the status of GSL\'s </p><p>economic reform program.  Choksy detailed the government\'s </p><p>privatization efforts, highlighting what the government had </p><p>already sold stakes in (petroleum, buses, telecom) and what </p><p>were the next items on the block (insurance, banking).  A/S </p><p>Lash raised government tender procedures and the need for </p><p>complete transparency at every stage of the process.  Choksy </p><p>said he hoped the privatizations would further decrease the </p><p>government\'s role in tenders.  For any remaining public </p><p>tenders, GSL has set up a board to speed up the process; only </p><p>tenders above a certain threshold ($2.5 million) would need to </p><p>go to the Cabinet for approval. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Choksy emphasized his government\'s desire for greater </p><p>commercial engagement with the U.S., noting that two-way trade </p><p>was currently heavily in Sri Lanka\'s favor.  Choksy asked what </p><p>the high-potential sectors for U.S. companies in Sri Lanka </p><p>might be.  A/S Lash and the Ambassador listed infrastructure </p><p>(especially power), IT and education as the key sectors where </p><p>U.S. companies could profitably participate.  A/S Lash noted </p><p>that education in particular was an area where the U.S. has a </p><p>competitive advantage; opening up Sri Lanka to private </p><p>education would attract interest from major U.S. institutions, </p><p>whose presence here would bring big benefits to the Sri Lankan </p><p>populace. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Meeting with Board of Investment </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>12.  A/S Lash and Ambassador Wills met with Board of Investment </p><p>(BOI) Chairman Arjunna Mahendran December 20.  After viewing a </p><p>BOI video presentation on what Sri Lanka offers the foreign </p><p>investor, A/S Lash encouraged Mahendran to keep pushing </p><p>economic reform within the government.  The foreign investor </p><p>looks closely at issues such as transparency, intellectual </p><p>property protection and the level/pace of privatization.  A/S </p><p>Lash cautioned Mahendran against letting other countries in the </p><p>region export their IPR violations to Sri Lanka.  If Sri Lanka </p><p>does a better job cracking down on import of pirated products, </p><p>U.S. investors will be more inclined to trust their </p><p>intellectual property assets to this market.  Improving the </p><p>local educational system, A/S Lash added, would enable Sri </p><p>Lanka to supply skilled workers in the quantities that foreign </p><p>investors demand.  A/S Lash encouraged Sri Lanka to open its </p><p>educational system across the board to private operators, from </p><p>vocational training to university and professional education; </p><p>many U.S. institutions would likely show interest in entering </p><p>the Sri Lankan educational market.  A/S Lash also emphasized </p><p>the importance of Sri Lanka raising its profile in the U.S., </p><p>now that peace was developing.  He pressed for Sri Lanka to </p><p>approve pending commercial deals (Caterpillar, Tamsco and IMC </p><p>Global), explaining again the importance of cultivating </p><p>champions of Sri Lanka in corporate America. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Meetings with Business Representatives </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  In a December 20 working breakfast hosted by the American </p><p>Chamber of Commerce, A/S Lash elicited the views of senior </p><p>AmCham members on the investment climate in Sri Lanka.  Members </p><p>described the local environment for business as generally </p><p>positive - few restrictions on imports, a talented and literate </p><p>labor force and a BOI that truly streamlines investment </p><p>approvals.  AmCham members raised several concerns, though. </p><p>Many commented that Sri Lanka\'s labor laws were too restrictive </p><p>(especially regarding terminations), discouraging possible new </p><p>investors from entering the market.  Telecom policy was also a </p><p>big hindrance to productivity.  Though the government had </p><p>nominally sold off part of Sri Lanka Telecom, the company still </p><p>controls the market in the absence of a truly independent </p><p>telecom regulator.  As a result bandwidth is poor and line </p><p>charges are high.  Members also decried the current level of </p><p>IPR protection in Sri Lanka, noting that GSL seems reluctant to </p><p>crack down on pirated knock-offs brought in from China.   A/S </p><p>Lash emphasized that a main goal of the increased commercial </p><p>engagement with Sri Lanka was to improve the atmosphere for </p><p>U.S. companies doing business here.  He asked AmCham reps to </p><p>continue to provide input to U.S. officials, so the U.S. can </p><p>prod Sri Lanka toward greater openness and transparency. </p><p> </p><p>14.  A/S Lash also met December 20 with the Ceylon Chamber of </p><p>Commerce (CCC), Sri Lanka\'s oldest and most active business </p><p>chamber, to hear members\' views on the local investment climate </p><p>and opportunities for U.S. companies.  A/S Lash emphasized the </p><p>need for greater two-way trade between the U.S. and Sri Lanka, </p><p>noting that the trade imbalance was currently 10:1 in Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s favor.  Chamber members offered that the best prospect </p><p>for increasing U.S. exports was textile fabric, and that the </p><p>CCC was looking for ways to connect U.S. textile suppliers with </p><p>Sri Lankan apparel manufacturers.  A/S Lash asked members what </p><p>their biggest concerns were on the investment climate. </p><p>Political instability, including the still nascent peace </p><p>process, and a poor tertiary education system were the greatest </p><p>obstacles to growth, members said.  A/S Lash pressed CCC to </p><p>lobby the government hard to open the education system, noting </p><p>that major U.S. institutions could play an active and positive </p><p>role in the Sri Lankan education sector.  Members praised the </p><p>USAID-funded competitiveness initiative for its role in </p><p>developing certain sectors and asked for additional technical </p><p>assistance in education, job creation and vocational training. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Media reaction </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. Lash\'s visit generated lavish press coverage.  A December </p><p>13 Embassy press release announcing his visit appeared in </p><p>independent and government-owned dailies, both English and </p><p>vernacular, under headlines such as "American trade minister </p><p>arrives," "U.S. Asst. Secretary of Trade will be in Sri Lanka </p><p>next week," and "U.S. Asst. Trade Secretary\'s visit to Sri </p><p>Lanka."  On December 20 the "Financial Times" section of the </p><p>DAILY MIRROR (independent English daily) carried Lash\'s picture </p><p>and c.v., plus a table of U.S.-Sri Lanka trade data under the </p><p>headline "US trade with Sri Lanka."  On December 20 the </p><p>Assistant Secretary and Ambassador Wills convened a press </p><p>conference for Sri Lanka\'s business, commercial, and finance </p><p>journalists.  The conference resonated in English and </p><p>vernacular newspapers through the weekend.  "Lanka\'s chances of </p><p>attracting foreign investment in IT look rosy - US Asst. </p><p>Commerce Secy" said the ISLAND (opposition English daily).  A </p><p>similar story appeared in DINAMINA (government-owned Sinhala </p><p>daily) under the headline "Sri Lanka has achieved the </p><p>capabilities to attract foreign investment in many spheres." </p><p>THINAKARAN (government-owned Tamil daily) quoted Lash: </p><p>"Conducive environment for investment in Sri Lanka."  The </p><p>MIRROR focused on Lash\'s compliance message with a story </p><p>headlined "US wants Lanka to nab pirated imports," and the </p><p>ISLAND followed suit with "US seeks crackdown against pirated </p><p>software, movies and music here."  And many of the Island\'s </p><p>dailies highlighted the linkages that the Assistant Secretary </p><p>and the Ambassador drew between peace and prosperity.  One </p><p>example:  "Peace will grow Lanka-US investment, trade" </p><p>(MIRROR). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16. A/S Lash\'s visit reinforced many of the same messages </p><p>delivered by Deputy USTR Ambassador Huntsman during the first </p><p>meeting of the bilateral Trade and Investment Council last </p><p>month.  It is now clear to GSL that achieving an enhanced trade </p><p>relationship with the U.S. will depend on its moving </p><p>aggressively to improve the local investment climate.  A/S </p><p>Lash\'s emphasis throughout the visit on IPR protection sent a </p><p>strong signal to GSL that the U.S. will be watching its </p><p>progress on this issue in particular in the coming months.  To </p><p>a large extent, we will be able to gauge GSL\'s commitment to </p><p>overall reform by how quickly and fully it improves IPR </p><p>legislation and enforcement. </p><p> </p><p>17. A/S Lash has cleared this cable. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
