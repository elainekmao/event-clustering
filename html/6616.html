(C) On March 13, Dart Field Office/North and Embassy </p><p>PMA Scott Oudkirk met with Col. Bernie Hunstad and Tom </p><p>Nett from NATO,s Euro-Atlantic Response Coordination </p><p>Center (EADRCC).  The one-hour meeting covered an overview </p><p>of NATO,s role in providing humanitarian supplies to the </p><p>Government of Turkey (GOT), as well as the role of the </p><p>DART and USG humanitarian contingency plans in Turkey. </p><p>NATO/EADRCC representatives were in Ankara to discuss </p><p>GOT,s request for assistance for humanitarian supplies, </p><p>as well as the potential need to place a NATO/EADRCC </p><p>Liaison Officer within the GOT,s Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs or Crisis Management Center. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) GOT requested humanitarian relief supplies from </p><p>NATO/EADRCC included tents, sleeping bags, and kitchen </p><p>sets for 276,000 people, as well as 552,000 blankets </p><p>and 30 vehicles.  NATO/EADRCC is in the process of </p><p>trying to fulfill GOT\'s request for humanitarian </p><p>assistance.  As of March 15, four nations (Croatia, </p><p>Hungary, Norway, and Canada) have informed NATO/EADRCC </p><p>of their intent to provide humanitarian assistance. </p><p>The pledged assistance includes tents for 800 people, </p><p>15,000 blankets, and 1,000 kitchen sets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DART Field Office/North stressed to NATO/EADRCC </p><p>that the number of humanitarian supplies requested by </p><p>GOT may support, to some extent, the 12 planned </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent (Kizilay) Internally Displaced </p><p>Persons (IDP) camps in northern Iraq.  Hunstad and </p><p>Nett indicated that NATO/EADRCC humanitarian supplies </p><p>would not be used for GOT/Kizilay humanitarian </p><p>operations in northern Iraq but for humanitarian needs </p><p>within Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DART Field Office/North is concerned that </p><p>NATO/EADRCC humanitarian supplies would encourage and </p><p>support Kizilay IDP camps in northern Iraq by offering </p><p>a mechanism for Kizilay to restock its humanitarian </p><p>cache in Turkey, while conducting humanitarian operations </p><p>in northern Iraq.  DART members indicated to NATO/EADRCC </p><p>that senior USG officials, as well as ICRC and IFRC, </p><p>have reminded Kizilay and GOT officials as recently as </p><p> March 12 that Kizilay has no jurisdiction to establish </p><p>displaced camps in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) NATO/EADRCC representatives in Ankara and DART </p><p>Field Office/North will continue to discuss humanitarian </p><p>contingency planning issues in the near future.  DART </p><p>Field Office/North will report additional information </p><p>as it becomes available. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
