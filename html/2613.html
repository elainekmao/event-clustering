<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 ABUJA 000829 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RIYADH FOR RUSS HANKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DECL:  02/13/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: RECENT EVENTS TEST NIGERIA\'S RESILIENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 ABUJA 2938 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Nigeria has seen its share of calamity and </p><p>contention in recent months.  The Ikeja cantonment </p><p>explosion, abortive police and general strikes, and an </p><p>electoral law enmeshed by controversy have decreased public </p><p>confidence in the Government\'s competence and have added to </p><p>a general skepticism about the country\'s direction. From </p><p>the unrest in Jos last September to February\'s Yoruba-Hausa </p><p>bloodletting in Lagos, episodes of communal violence have </p><p>claimed at least 4,000 lives, a figure rivaling casualty </p><p>counts for nations suffering low intensity warfare. The </p><p>December assassination of Attorney General Ige heralds to </p><p>many Nigerians that resort to violence to settle political </p><p>disputes will increase as the 2003 elections draw near. </p><p>Ethnicity, regionalism and, to some extent, religious </p><p>intolerance have become more virulent, further tainting the </p><p>political discourse while electoral considerations will </p><p>likely increase government spending despite the reality </p><p>that the economy will be hard pressed to approximate last </p><p>year\'s modest growth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary Continued: The picture painted above is </p><p>long on difficulties, short on optimism. The honeymoon </p><p>occasioning the return of civilian rule not only is over, </p><p>for many it is forgotten. Left remaining are the stark </p><p>realities of weak democratic institutions and traditions, a </p><p>near-unprecedented sense of public insecurity, a stagnant </p><p>economy and a combative and fragmented political culture. </p><p>Because confrontation is an ingrained aspect of most social </p><p>and political exchange, controversy and violence are </p><p>frequent by-products of the working of institutions usually </p><p>associated with the peaceful resolution of political </p><p>disputes in more mature democracies.  However, due to their </p><p>frequency, these social and political conflicts have less </p><p>impact than outside observers might think.  In other words, </p><p>Nigeria is experiencing political decline but meltdown is </p><p>not imminent, nor are people panicking, nor is the decline </p><p>necessarily irreversible. Nigerians have been on this </p><p>roller coaster before.  Nevertheless, levelheaded Nigerians </p><p>are worried.  Unless a carminative is taken to purge </p><p>politics of its dyspepsia (primarily by making electoral </p><p>preparations transparent and neutral) and to improve the </p><p>security situation, the electoral season will likely spawn </p><p>more violence and shrill cries from government opponents </p><p>that the electoral fix is on. This will complicate the task </p><p>of governance, bringing the Obasanjo Administration\'s </p><p>legitimacy and the propriety of the democratic experiment </p><p>in Nigeria into very serious question.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>NOT A HAPPY PICTURE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Last November, we reported that Nigeria had hit a </p><p>very troubling period, described by some as the most </p><p>violent period since the civil war (reftel.)  Religious and </p><p>ethnic violence in Jos, Kano, the eastern Middle Belt and </p><p>Lagos, and intermittent outbursts in the South-South </p><p>coupled with internecine squabbling within the ruling party </p><p>had engendered a feeling of widespread public insecurity </p><p>and concern about the lack of domestic policy focus of the </p><p>Government. The controversy over the electoral law raised </p><p>the specter that Obasanjo was trying to fix the 2003 </p><p>election.  At that time, we stated tensions would mount </p><p>unless political elites stopped seeing brinkmanship as </p><p>their primary vocation and until Government devised a </p><p>strategy for enhancing security by minimizing communal </p><p>violence.  Since then, misstep, misfortune and mistake have </p><p>dogged Nigeria even further. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>STILL TRAVELLING THE POLITICAL LOW ROAD </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) President Obasanjo and restive political elites </p><p>have not made the needed adjustments either to the </p><p>substance or style of their political debate and conduct. </p><p>Continuation of business as usual is a major factor in the </p><p>steady turning of the Nigerian situation from bad to worse. </p><p>While the AD might be even more fractious, the squabbling </p><p>within the ruling PDP demonstrates the impediments to </p><p>effective governance produced by a combative political </p><p>culture.  Since the PDP is the dominant party, it sets the </p><p>tone in the political and electoral arena.  In so many </p><p>instances, the winner of the PDP nomination will be </p><p>considered the presumptive victor in the general election. </p><p>Because of this, competition within the PDP often </p><p>approximates what is usually seen in inter-party rivalry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) For its November convention, the PDP leadership </p><p>orchestrated a display of unity that turned acrimony into a </p><p>festive event.  The naming of well-respected Audu Ogbeh to </p><p>replace the embattled Barnabas Gemade as PDP National </p><p>Chairman was to augur harmony.  However, the reconciliation </p><p>was brief.  By early December, the President was mired in </p><p>controversy over the inclusion of a restriction against new </p><p>parties in the electoral law.  Friction turned to heat as </p><p>Obasanjo attributed authorship of the noxious provision to </p><p>House Speaker Na\'abba while Na\'abba pointed fingers at </p><p>Obasanjo and Senate President Anyim.  Anyim, widely </p><p>regarded as Obasanjo\'s loyal minion, was hounded in the </p><p>press. Some Senate colleagues called for his impeachment. </p><p>PDP Chairman Ogbeh tried to reconcile the trio, but failed. </p><p>The Presidency and the PDP were able to stave an inchoate </p><p>rebellion in January to eject Anyim from the Senate </p><p>Presidency in Nigeria\'s most common fashion; according to </p><p>many observers, they paid for it, doling out funds to key </p><p>Senators to make sure Anyim stayed put.  The Senate </p><p>leader\'s removal would have been a blow to the President, </p><p>and an equally low blow to the Senate, which has removed </p><p>two Senate Presidents in the past two years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The electoral law kindled the disunity Obasanjo and </p><p>other politicians said they wanted to avoid. Ironically, </p><p>this attempt by the Presidency to maximize its political </p><p>and electoral advantage by unilaterally (and </p><p>surreptitiously) amending the law failed. Neglect of the </p><p>political interests of other aspirants for office whose </p><p>destinies would be affected by the law doomed the measure </p><p>ab initio. By trying to finesse via legislation what was </p><p>essentially a political question, the Presidency created an </p><p>unnecessary political storm that continues to rage.  With </p><p>the PDP\'s top three elected officials engaged in a triangle </p><p>of recrimination, other latent PDP squabbles resurfaced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.   (C) The factionalism that plagued the party in many </p><p>states, particularly in the Southeast, before the November </p><p>convention returned with the vigor of pent-up energy. </p><p>Fists and gunshots were exchanged between rival Anambra </p><p>State factions at a PDP national meeting in January.  Key </p><p>party figures groused that Obasanjo was attempting to </p><p>control party nominations at all levels. More than once, </p><p>several governors, many fearing they were on Obasanjo\'s </p><p>blacklist, met behind closed doors to discuss ways to </p><p>secure their positions. By January, more independent-minded </p><p>thinkers in the party were saying what was generally </p><p>unthinkable a year ago: that Obasanjo should not seek </p><p>reelection because he was a major reason for the country\'s </p><p>political troubles. Around the same period, former Kano </p><p>State Governor Mohammed Abubakar Rimi formally announced </p><p>his candidacy for the Presidential nomination. Since then, </p><p>the vociferous Rimi has been fustigating  Obasanjo, calling </p><p>him unfit for office and the author of the Nigeria\'s woes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) After years of military rule, many Nigerian\'s are </p><p>not accustomed to "subordinates" publicly saying that their </p><p>boss, especially a Head of State, should quit. Thus, public </p><p>talk by PDP members that Obasanjo should forego the 2003 </p><p>election ironically has a conspiratorial ring to some. </p><p>Psychologically, it is the political equivalent of coup </p><p>plotting.  People are asking themselves if PDP politicians </p><p>have become so bold as to attack Obasanjo so openly, what </p><p>is happening when the politicians met behind closed doors? </p><p>Adding to the sense of unease, people also wonder, how does </p><p>the military view this lack of discipline within the </p><p>political ranks? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) While the PDP seems in danger of devouring itself, </p><p>the two other registered parties are too weak, enervated </p><p>and afflicted by their own brand of factionalism to exploit </p><p>the PDP\'s self-flagellation.  Thus far, neither of the two </p><p>nor any of the unregistered parties has painted an </p><p>alternative picture of governance and internal unity to </p><p>attract the public. (Better competition from the other </p><p>parties would also force the PDP, which now considers </p><p>itself the only game in town, to straighten its act </p><p>somewhat.) The major story with the unregistered parties </p><p>has been whether former Head of State Babangida will emerge </p><p>as a presidential candidate.  The Babangida aura mesmerizes </p><p>some; but for most democratic-minded Nigerians, his name is </p><p>synonymous with military rule, drift, waste and corruption. </p><p>For them, even talk of his candidacy is considered a </p><p>retrograde step. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) By re-igniting the antipathy between Obasanjo and </p><p>House Speaker Na\'abba, the electoral law fracas strained </p><p>relations between the Executive and the Lower House. </p><p>Reconvening late January, one of the House\'s first orders </p><p>of business was to debate the state of the nation.  Spiced </p><p>by media revelations that some lawmakers favored </p><p>impeachment proceedings against the President, the debate </p><p>pilloried Obasanjo.  The representatives blamed Obasanjo </p><p>for much of the nation\'s woes, from poverty to corruption </p><p>to communal violence.  Apparently upset by the House </p><p>debate, Obasanjo withheld the lawmakers\' salaries under the </p><p>pretext that they failed to comply with his request for </p><p>them to disclose fully their pay and emoluments. </p><p>Continuing the tit-for-tat, the Representatives have filed </p><p>suit and delayed consideration of the federal budget until </p><p>Obasanjo releases the monies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Characteristic of Nigerian politics, both sides </p><p>dug in their heels after taking confrontational positions. </p><p>Because both sides took positions where yielding meant loss </p><p>of face, third party intercession became necessary.  Again </p><p>enter PDP Chairman Ogbeh, this time in concert with Senate </p><p>President Anyim.  The two men shuttled between the Villa </p><p>and the House to end the standoff.  After few weeks of </p><p>tugging, the duo softened Obasanjo to the point of agreeing </p><p>to partial payment of salaries and succeeded in temporarily </p><p>quashing anger in the Assembly that was beginning to spur </p><p>renewed chatter by some members about impeachment </p><p>proceedings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The bickering makes for good drama; however, the </p><p>discord reinforces the public perception of a dysfunctional </p><p>federal government in Abuja.  The debate on his leadership </p><p>and talk of impeachment contribute to the sense that </p><p>Obasanjo is vulnerable.  Obasanjo now has to protect </p><p>himself from former supporters who think they can gain </p><p>political capital by using his name as fodder. Likewise, </p><p>Obasanjo is playing hardball politics and lashing out at </p><p>critics in ways less than presidential. What Obasanjo and </p><p>many of his ardent opponents fail to recognize is that </p><p>their brawling continues to consume too much space on the </p><p>political agenda. More so now than just three months ago, </p><p>the public is dissatisfied with what they view as </p><p>government mismanagement of the nation.  Too many Nigerians </p><p>feel the politicians have had sufficient time to find their </p><p>direction. The reason they have not done so is because they </p><p>are hopelessly venal as a class. Most people believe a </p><p>major change is needed, but a lot of Nigerians are at a </p><p>loss as to what that change should be and how it should </p><p>come. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>COMMUNAL VIOLENCE MAKES THE GOVERNMENT LOOK INEPT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) The early February clashes in Lagos reinforce the </p><p>belief that the Federal Government is unable to protect the </p><p>lives and meager property holdings of average Nigerians. </p><p>Moreover, every instance of violence increases ethnic, </p><p>religious and regional tension.  With each clash, the group </p><p>feeling victimized criticizes the Federal Government as </p><p>uncaring about its suffering or even accuses it of being </p><p>supportive of the "aggressor" group. To bolster their </p><p>popularity, political figures are appealing to divisive and </p><p>parochial interests. They demagogically blame the Federal </p><p>Government and its alleged bias for others as a reason for </p><p>their groups problems. The salience of ethno-regional </p><p>organizations such as Ohaneze Ndigbo (Igbo-Southeast), </p><p>Afenifere (Yoruba-Southwest) Arewa Consultative Forum </p><p>(ACF) (North, Hausa-dominated) has increased in this </p><p>milieu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) The Federal Government has not helped matters by </p><p>openly criticizing these organizations as being sources of </p><p>divisiveness in national politics.  These groups have </p><p>responded that they are forced to protect the interests of </p><p>their "people" because of the inaction of the Federal </p><p>Government. For example, in the wake of the Yoruba/Hausa </p><p>clash in Lagos, the ACF issued a statement blaming the </p><p>Federal and Lagos State Governments for being pro-Yoruba </p><p>and lenient to Yoruba miscreants while not protecting Hausa </p><p>residents.  This was the latest of a string of ACF </p><p>statements castigating the Administration for neglecting </p><p>Northern interests.  Other groups perceive the federal </p><p>government as turning its back as well. Tivs in Benue </p><p>complain they are still being targeted by federal soldiers </p><p>and that they will take matters into their own hands to </p><p>protect their ethnic brethren. While the government has </p><p>established various commissions to examine instances of </p><p>communal violence, it seems incapable of developing a </p><p>consensus strategy to reduce the occurrences.  Because of </p><p>the perceived government inability, ethnic and regional </p><p>chauvinism have increased as groups threaten to take the </p><p>law into their own hands to protect their own. If these </p><p>feelings are not stemmed, they will feed violence and </p><p>further fuel anti-government sentiment along ethnic and </p><p>regional lines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>OF THINGS TO COME -- ELECTORAL VIOLENCE? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>15.  (C) Hyperbole, although now at a heightened level, is </p><p>the usual fare in Nigerian politics.  However, the December </p><p>23 assassination of Attorney General Bola Ige brought </p><p>something more troubling to the mix.   Most likely the </p><p>result of escalation in the rivalry between the Osun </p><p>Governor and his Deputy, the murder shocked Nigerians. </p><p>Some try to wish it away as an aberration; others hope it </p><p>is a lesson that will force the political class to modulate </p><p>its tone.  Uncharitably, more than a few non-Yorubas see in </p><p>Ige\'s death evidence of the depravity of intra-Yoruba </p><p>politics and a lesson that Yorubas, including Obasanjo, </p><p>make bad politicians.  However, many sober-minded Nigerians </p><p>fear the assassination is a harbinger for elections to </p><p>come.  If political competition more than a year away from </p><p>the actual polling can result in the death of a Cabinet </p><p>Minister, what will be the level of violence when elections </p><p>draw near?  Instances of intramural violence in the PDP, </p><p>particularly in the Southeast, underscore the fear that </p><p>violence and elections are close companions in the Nigerian </p><p>context.  That a significant factor in the unrest in the </p><p>Benue, Taraba, Nasarawa triangle is competition for control </p><p>of local government areas also lends credence to the notion </p><p>that violence and electoral politics go together. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>REALLY THE WRONG TIME -- IKEJA </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) There never is an opportune time for tragedy, but </p><p>the Ikeja explosion was more than untimely. Already nursing </p><p>its many self-inflicted wounds, the Government was not </p><p>prepared to react quickly to Ikeja.  The cantonment was a </p><p>latent crisis inherited from the military.  While the </p><p>Obasanjo Administration should not be blamed for the </p><p>problem, the unpredictable explosion -- coming after many </p><p>other recent troubles -- sent the impression to a populace </p><p>that believes in omens that the Administration was doomed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Obasanjo\'s initial poor handling of the  crisis, </p><p>especially his public remarks that he did not want to visit </p><p>the disaster area made him look callous. Subsequent excuses </p><p>that he had not been informed that anyone had died, only </p><p>made him look feckless.  The (for Nigeria) massive sums </p><p>announced for relief assuaged some anger but did not </p><p>address the underlying perception of Government\'s lack of </p><p>compassion for the governed.   Ironically, the more </p><p>conspiratorially-minded concluded that the Government might </p><p>have literally dodged a bullet because a coup attempt had </p><p>been foiled by the clumsiness of coup plotters mishandling </p><p>ordnance stored at the depot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>THE ECONOMY-- A LEAN YEAR IN THE MAKING </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) On the economic front, a soft global economy </p><p>depresses demand for oil, Nigeria\'s economic mainstay. To </p><p>help OPEC keep prices stable, Nigeria must cooperate in </p><p>production cutbacks.  Government spending must therefore </p><p>shrink in proportion to its revenues to avoid a huge </p><p>deficit.  In part to save money, the government reduced the </p><p>subsidy on fuel in January, causing a price hike.  Not only </p><p>did fuel prices increase by about 20 percent, the price of </p><p>many commodities climbed sharply and transportation costs </p><p>nearly doubled in some areas as opportunistic transport </p><p>operators sought to gouge the public and deflect blame onto </p><p>the GON.  Stung by the price hike and by the failure of </p><p>government to honor its 2000 promise to increase the </p><p>minimum wage, the Nigerian Labor Congress called a national </p><p>strike.  The strike fizzled after two days primarily due to </p><p>lack of public enthusiasm.   The Government helped kill the </p><p>strike by arresting NLC leaders.  While its tactics helped </p><p>muzzle the strike, the Administration\'s adamant refusal to </p><p>negotiate any aspect of the price hike and its timing </p><p>caused the NLC leadership to lose face, straining the </p><p>relationship between government and labor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) Heavy-handedness was also evident in the </p><p>government\'s response to the unprecedented police strike, </p><p>just a few weeks after the general labor action.  Junior </p><p>police officers organized the nationwide strike, protesting </p><p>non-payment of allowances for several months.  The strike </p><p>was honored in Lagos and several other states.  Government </p><p>acted swiftly to quell the strike, perhaps fearing an </p><p>increase in lawlessness should the strike hold.  The </p><p>strike\'s architects were arrested and charged with mutiny. </p><p>Dangling a carrot, the Government promised partial payment </p><p>of the arrearages. While the combination of coercion and </p><p>payment ended the strike, it did not resolve the gripes of </p><p>police officers.  Again, by intimidating the strikers, the </p><p>government damaged the morale of an institution crucial to </p><p>democracy while also harming the relationship between </p><p>government and rank-and-file police officers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) Looming ominously is a potential shortfall </p><p>regarding state civil servant salaries.  With the reduction </p><p>of the federal revenue allocation to the states due to </p><p>diminished oil prices, some states will be hard-pressed to </p><p>pay civil servant salaries in a few months.  Affected civil </p><p>servants in numerous states may strike. If so, the country </p><p>may return to crisis mode, perhaps reviving calls for a </p><p>nationwide strike especially now that organized labor is </p><p>nursing a grudge.  Several states face bankruptcy, having </p><p>taken out loans during the days of 30-dollar oil that they </p><p>cannot possibly repay with oil in the low 20s and fewer </p><p>barrels being pumped. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.  (C) There is a growing sense that the average Nigerian </p><p>is worse off now than in 1999, when oil prices were in the </p><p>low teens.  Coupled with liberal "official" overseas travel </p><p>by politicians at all levels of government and the sudden </p><p>affluence of many office-holders who were penurious three </p><p>years ago, Nigerians are asking whether their "democracy </p><p>dividend" has been used to unjustly enrich others. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C) Driven by electoral considerations, the GON, </p><p>unfortunately, seems poised to release large amounts of </p><p>cash into the economy now that it has broken formally with </p><p>the IMF (septel).  While citizens may feel better for a few </p><p>weeks, suffusing a low-productivity economy with more paper </p><p>will likely produce a new surge in inflation and </p><p>depreciation of the Naira unless interest rates (already </p><p>above 40 percent) are tightened further.  This scenario </p><p>will make it much harder to generate the jobs and growth </p><p>needed to genuinely improve living standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C) Nigeria\'s governing elite continues to give little </p><p>thought to the less fortunate.  The very same week </p><p>authorities bulldozed the ramshackle booths of petty </p><p>traders at Wuse Market -- claiming to restore the integrity </p><p>of the city\'s master plan, Senate President Anyim Pius </p><p>Anyim started to build a townhouse development on land </p><p>reserved as green space.  Alerted to this incongruity, </p><p>figures close to President Obasanjo said nothing could be </p><p>done because Anyim is "someone we need very much."  Even </p><p>PDP Chairman Audu Ogbeh (protect) despaired of elite </p><p>attitudes:  "They think that once they have made it, then </p><p>their brothers can just sleep (die or disappear)" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24.  (C) The double standard is nothing new to Nigerians. </p><p>Military figures were often more venal, but they were fewer </p><p>in number and seemed less hypocritical because they never </p><p>spoke to the public of the "benefits of democracy" while </p><p>privately dipping their hands in the cookie jar. The </p><p>country\'s elected elites and their hangers-on are far more </p><p>numerous, causing many people to believe the total volume </p><p>of graft exceeds that of the Abacha years.  Moreover, the </p><p>elected elites talk about democracy and transparency, and </p><p>the apparent hypocrisy has given rise to seething anger in </p><p>some areas.  Some in the GON are working for transparency </p><p>and good governance, but they must fight the ingrained bad </p><p>habits of others.  While Obasanjo seems to detest </p><p>misappropriation and bribery generally, he ignores it when </p><p>figures such as Works and Housing Minister Tony Anenih and </p><p>Legislative Liaison Officer Esther Uduehi use them as </p><p>instruments to further his political objectives (see, for </p><p>example, para 5). In large measure due to this ambivalent </p><p>position, Obasanjo has been unable to make serious progress </p><p>in his stated fight against official corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>The Military: Waiting in the Shadows </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25.  (C) Traditionally, the military has rationalized its </p><p>takeovers as necessary to save the nation from the chaos of </p><p>civilian incompetence and avarice. Despite the successive </p><p>crises that have visited Nigeria recently, the military </p><p>does not seem posed to takeover.  Morale in the military is </p><p>low and the officer corps are not united about the way </p><p>forward.  Many officers are against a return to military </p><p>rule, and a public disillusioned by nearly two decades of </p><p>military rule is not (yet) so fed up with elected civilians </p><p>to accept the military\'s return. While the military may not </p><p>be primed for a coup, all is far from well.  There is </p><p>significant grumbling about Government neglect of the </p><p>soldiers yet relying on them as its last line of defense </p><p>against communal violence.  Events after the Ikeja </p><p>explosion symbolize the estranged relationship between the </p><p>military and the Administration.  When Vice President Atiku </p><p>Abubakar visited Ikeja, he was forced to leave after </p><p>soldiers pelted his motorcade with water bags and debris. </p><p>They were angry over the government\'s failure to respond to </p><p>their emergency needs immediately after the tragedy.  The </p><p>offending unit was promptly rusticated.  Almost anywhere in </p><p>the world, but more so in a country with Nigeria\'s </p><p>political history, soldiers throwing things at the nation\'s </p><p>second highest office-holder is not a good sign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>LOOKING AHEAD </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26.  (C) Because Nigeria has not had a "new" crisis in the </p><p>past few weeks, some of the high anxiety from the serial </p><p>crises is wearing off. However, most Nigerians are acutely </p><p>aware that their country is closer to the red zone than </p><p>just a few months ago. Two big problems remain: 1) </p><p>Electoral politics and fairness, and 2) Communal violence </p><p>and internal insecurity.  As noted earlier in this message, </p><p>these two issues are inter-related.  Because elections are </p><p>now just one year away, time is precious. Unless the GON </p><p>can get a grip on both of these problems, more violence and </p><p>political malaise will be difficult to prevent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27.  (C) Because this Administration is the first adult </p><p>experience with civilian democracy for much of the </p><p>populace, may not be able to differentiate between </p><p>Nigeria\'s democratic institutions and the flawed people now </p><p>debasing them.  The return of civilian rule has been </p><p>replaced by widespread frustration over the lack of </p><p>manifest democracy dividends. The trials of the past few </p><p>months have tested public faith in democracy. While few </p><p>(yet) want to see a return to military rule, each new GON </p><p>misstep incrementally increases the number of people who </p><p>write off the Obasanjo Administration. The possibility of a </p><p>military self-reintroduction into politics is inversely </p><p>proportionate to popular support for civilian government. </p><p>The great risk is that continued failures and missteps will </p><p>increase the (still-minimal) numbers who question whether </p><p>Nigeria is a viable host for democratic government. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
