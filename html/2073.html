<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002667 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/18/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PTER, BEXP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VICE PRESIDENT ON THE GLOBAL COALITION </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM, MONEY LAUNDERING AND RESTRUCTURING JEPC </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 169975 (B) STATE 170551 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for Reasons 1.5(b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Ambassador Jeter met October 12 with Vice </p><p>President Atiku Abubakar to discuss tighter money laundering </p><p>controls in Nigeria, the proposed structure for the "son of </p><p>JEPC", the need to increase U.S. investment in Nigeria and </p><p>bilateral trade.  Although offering condolences for the </p><p>September 11 attacks, the Vice President qualified his </p><p>remarks, suggesting the U.S. examine the reasons behind the </p><p>attacks, such as USG policy in the Middle East.  USAID </p><p>Director Tom Hobgood, RNLEO and EconOff (notetaker) also </p><p>attended.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Beginning the meeting, Ambassador Jeter expressed </p><p>condolences for the victims of the recent violence in Jos. </p><p>The Vice President thanked the Ambassador, characterizing Jos </p><p>as a traditionally "quiet and peaceful" city.  He offered </p><p>Ambassador Jeter condolences over the September 11 attacks, </p><p>adding, "it is unbelievable and sad that the world has become </p><p>violent in this way."  The Vice President expressed grief for </p><p>America, "a country where many Nigerians, including myself, </p><p>have taken refuge," in times of trouble in their own country. </p><p> Atiku said that he took the attack on the United States very </p><p>personally, feeling it was an attack on him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Fight Against Terrorism: Money Laundering </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Although terrorism represents an unprecedented </p><p>challenge, Ambassador Jeter stated the U.S. would remain </p><p>committed to the global fight against terrorism for the long </p><p>haul.  In addition to diplomatic and military responses to </p><p>the threat, the global coalition sought to handcuff the </p><p>criminals by blocking their funding sources.  The Ambassador </p><p>conveyed reftel themes, stressing that Nigeria should move </p><p>quickly to strengthen financial crime controls, particularly </p><p>over money laundering.  Ambassador Jeter suggested the </p><p>Financial Crimes Commission, as proposed by President </p><p>Obasanjo, could play a critical role in coordinating </p><p>intelligence on financial crimes as well as law enforcement </p><p>response.  Ambassador Jeter handed the Vice President a short </p><p>non-paper outlining the steps Nigeria needed to take (as </p><p>suggested Ref B) to be removed from the FATF\'s NCCT list, the </p><p>first step being to answer the original FATF questionnaire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Vice President promised that Nigeria\'s performance </p><p>would improve.  The GON would establish a strong central </p><p>body, in the form of the Financial Crimes Commission, and </p><p>enact effective anti-money laundering legislation that would </p><p>have the "required teeth and effectiveness to fight </p><p>terrorism."  Vice President Abubakar said draft legislation </p><p>to create the FCC was pending approval by President Obasanjo </p><p>and the Federal Executive Council before being sent to the </p><p>National Assembly for ratification.  He promised to meet with </p><p>Ministers of Finance and Justice October 15 to ensure the </p><p>FATF questionnaire\'s completion and transmittal to Paris. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter commented that sending the completed </p><p>questionnaire to the FATF, while important, was only a small </p><p>step towards \'recertification\' as a cooperating country.  The </p><p>Vice President offered to send the Embassy the committee\'s </p><p>draft report "to demonstrate our commitment to move on this </p><p>issue."  Moreover, he said that he would soon send the </p><p>minutes of the Committee\'s meeting and any proposed </p><p>recommendations to the FATF, as a sign of Nigeria\'s good </p><p>intentions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador Jeter handed the Vice President copies of </p><p>the U.S. Executive Order and list of 27 prosecuted terrorist </p><p>entities.  The Vice President commented that some Nigerian </p><p>NGOs might have some contact with these entities, but </p><p>promised that Nigerian intelligence would investigate </p><p>possible connections.  The Ambassador asked whether the </p><p>Africa International Bank (formerly the Bank for Commerce and </p><p>Credit International) had ties to Kabul and the Taliban. </p><p>Vice President Abubakar denied any connection between </p><p>Nigerian banks and Afghanistan, except perhaps Habib Bank, he </p><p>said.  The Vice President recalled, however, that Middle </p><p>Eastern businessmen, interested in banking sector </p><p>investments, had visited Nigeria recently.  Some investment </p><p>in the recently privatized United Bank of Africa came from </p><p>the Middle East, he added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Restructuring JEPC </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Ambassador Jeter presented the U.S. interagency </p><p>recommendations on U.S. - Nigeria bilateral engagement and </p><p>restructuring the Joint Economic Partnership Committee. </p><p>Three committees would be created: Economic, Law Enforcement, </p><p>and Defense.  Each Committee would establish an agenda and </p><p>objectives, which would then be tasked to working groups for </p><p>action.  If the GON accepted this proposal, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>suggested, the two sides could meet as early as 2002 in </p><p>either the U.S. or Nigeria.  Examples of objectives could </p><p>include creation of a Nigerian Investment Fund, increase in </p><p>non-oil trade, increase in agricultural output and </p><p>self-sufficiency in refined oil products.  The Vice President </p><p>responded that he "already had some different ideas on this." </p><p> The Embassy should discuss the proposal in detail with his </p><p>staff.  The sooner the better, he stressed.  He wanted </p><p>significant progress by June 2002, before the election period </p><p>in Nigeria begins in earnest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Ambassador Jeter asked who would lead this issue for </p><p>the GON.  The Vice President replied that the lead would be </p><p>Chief Economic Advisor Magnus Kpakol with the caveat that, as </p><p>Chairman of the Privatization Council, the Chief Economic </p><p>Advisor reports to the Vice President.  (Comment.  Kpakol\'s </p><p>predecessor, Philip Asiodu, had a notoriously competitive </p><p>relationship with the Vice President on most economic policy </p><p>issues.  It appears that the Vice President\'s relationship </p><p>with the new Chief Economic Advisor will be more cooperative. </p><p> End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Bilateral Commercial Relationship </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Ambassador Jeter suggested that the Economic Committee </p><p>could provide a structure in which the two countries could </p><p>tackle bilateral trade issues.  In meetings with the </p><p>Corporate Council on Africa in September, the Ambassador </p><p>witnessed skepticism amongst U.S. companies in respect of </p><p>Nigeria\'s non-oil sector.  Ambassador Jeter commented that, </p><p>to attract U.S. companies into Nigeria\'s non-oil sectors, </p><p>they must first see some non-oil success stories.  The Vice </p><p>President agreed a major breakthrough would be achieved if </p><p>this were done.  He felt there had been a slight increase in </p><p>interest from U.S. companies.  More companies had requested </p><p>meetings with him.  However, the Vice President averred, </p><p>these companies appeared unfamiliar with Nigeria and needed </p><p>enticements and encouragement from the GON.  Vice President </p><p>Abubakar asserted U.S. companies should bring their proposals </p><p>directly to him -- before problems arise, not afterward.  He </p><p>explained that by the time a company encounters an obstacle, </p><p>it was often too late for him to intervene because of </p><p>political sensitivities, i.e., it could embarrass the </p><p>Minister involved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Domestic Security </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Ambassador asked the Vice President for his </p><p>assessment of the current security situation in light of </p><p>occasional statements by Nigerian Muslim clerics that appear </p><p>sympathetic to Osama bin-Laden.  The Vice President replied </p><p>that there were no signs of terrorists operating in Nigeria. </p><p>However, he added, all GON security agencies were on </p><p>heightened alert, anticipating that GON response time to any </p><p>situation would be swift.  Although Africa should not be </p><p>regarded as a danger zone by the global coalition against </p><p>terrorism, all African nations should be on high alert in </p><p>case terrorists begin to migrate here, he advised. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Ambassador Jeter emphasized the serious threat the </p><p>world was now facing, pointing to a long string of attacks on </p><p>U.S. interests from the East Africa Embassy and USS Cole </p><p>bombings to the more recent WTC attacks.  The Vice President </p><p>suggested that America ask why this was happening, "what is </p><p>America doing?", he asked.  Ambassador Jeter replied that </p><p>while many Americans asked these questions, grievances </p><p>against the U.S. should be discussed and negotiated, not used </p><p>to senselessly slaughter innocent people.  The Vice President </p><p>agreed the attacks were inexcusable, but offered it was "high </p><p>time the U.S. look at the question of why it (terrorist </p><p>attacks) always comes from the Middle East."  He referred to </p><p>comments by CNN correspondent Lou Dobbs who suggested the USG </p><p>had been insensitive to Middle East problems and must now </p><p>harmonize its views with the rest of the world.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter again reiterated that these attacks were instruments of </p><p>terror that, next time, might strike outside the United </p><p>States.  Vice President Abubakar agreed it was a global </p><p>problem; Nigeria was committed to preventing these atrocities </p><p>from recurring and was "determined to keep Nigeria safe for </p><p>everyone." </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
