Summary:  The serious human rights crime of </p><p>Trafficking in Persons appears on the rise in West and </p><p>Central Africa and confronting this problem is a USG </p><p>priority.  Through this strategy, U.S. Missions in the </p><p>region will employ limited USG resources to engage </p><p>host governments, NGOs and regional organizations to </p><p>implement effective actions aimed at prosecuting </p><p>traffickers and their accomplices, protecting rescued </p><p>and repatriated trafficking victims and preventing the </p><p>occurrence of new trafficking incidents.  The African </p><p>Affairs Bureau and Office to Monitor and Combat </p><p>Trafficking in Persons will guide Missions in the </p><p>region and coordinate the allocation of resources. </p><p>End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. Strategic Goal </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. "U.S. Missions in West and Central Africa will help </p><p>host governments, regional organizations, and NGOs to </p><p>develop and strengthen the mechanisms necessary to </p><p>reduce the incidence of trafficking in persons in the </p><p>region." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. This goal should be incorporated into Mission </p><p>Performance Plans of Missions throughout the region as </p><p>a sub-goal/objective under MPP Goals "DE - Democracy" </p><p>and "IC - International Crime." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Introduction </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. According to UNICEF, hundreds of thousands of </p><p>persons, especially women and children from West and </p><p>Central Africa, have become victims of trafficking for </p><p>forced labor exploitation every year.  Described by </p><p>Secretary Powell as, "one of the most egregious human </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>rights violations," trafficking is one of the fastest </p><p>growing and most profitable criminal enterprises </p><p>throughout the world.  During his address at the </p><p>recently released Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, </p><p>Secretary Powell stated that there are at least </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>700,000 new victims of trafficking worldwide each </p><p>year.  Considered a serious human and worker rights </p><p>problem in West and Central Africa, trafficking </p><p>appears to be on the rise and is fueled by on-going </p><p>adverse social and economic conditions in the region. </p><p>Ending this transnational human rights crime is a </p><p>priority for the Bush Administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. As women and children are the primary targets of </p><p>trafficking, the AF Bureau will work with our West </p><p>African posts to raise host country and international </p><p>awareness of the vulnerability of these female and </p><p>child populations.  The Governments of Benin, Burkina </p><p>Faso, Cameroon, Cote d\'Ivoire, Ghana, Gabon, Mali, </p><p>Nigeria and Togo have shown signs of greater </p><p>awareness, and to varying degrees, are actively </p><p>engaged in combating the problem.  Forms of child </p><p>trafficking include the traditional practice of child </p><p>placement for work in the informal commercial sector, </p><p>agricultural work, domestic servitude, and begging. </p><p>The trafficking of women tends to be primarily for </p><p>sexual exploitation and is often conducted by </p><p>traditional criminal elements.  Though the forms and </p><p>destinations of trafficking vary widely, trafficking </p><p>victims often work in very difficult and hazardous </p><p>conditions and in some instances are essentially </p><p>slaves, held against their will and receiving little </p><p>or no wages.  Many women and girls who are victims of </p><p>trafficking find themselves working in the commercial </p><p>sex industry in Africa and Europe.  Criminal elements </p><p>frequently use deception and false advertising to </p><p>recruit these female victims of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The US must work cooperatively with host country </p><p>governments in devising clear short- and long-term </p><p>strategies to legislate against, enforce and prosecute </p><p>the traffickers who engage in the buying and selling </p><p>of persons.  Mechanisms must be put in place to </p><p>educate the population concerning the methods </p><p>recruiters use.  We must also work to rescue those </p><p>victims of trafficking who are able to escape and who </p><p>need protection, education or training in order to be </p><p>reintegrated into society and lead normal, productive </p><p>lives.  Prevention efforts aimed at addressing some of </p><p>the root causes of trafficking, such as lack of </p><p>adequate economic opportunities, will also be </p><p>emphasized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. In order to effectively combat trafficking in West </p><p>Africa (and by extension to Africa as a whole) there </p><p>is a clear need for a coordinated and integrated </p><p>regional approach.  The AF Bureau, in partnership with </p><p>G/TIP, INL, DRL, PRM, and IO, is launching a </p><p>comprehensive regional strategy to combat trafficking </p><p>of persons in West Africa.  This strategy will be </p><p>coordinated through the regional trafficking </p><p>coordinator in Lagos, posts in countries most affected </p><p>by TIP, USG agencies and international donor efforts. </p><p>Given the limited available resources and many </p><p>competing demands, it is important to pursue an </p><p>approach that seeks to identify those areas that will </p><p>ensure the maximum effect, to complement existing </p><p>efforts, and to find out from West African governments </p><p>what they think would help. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Bureau Strategy </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Definition and Scope: This strategy will use the </p><p>definition of trafficking in persons incorporated in </p><p>the UN Transnational Crime Convention\'s Protocol on </p><p>Trafficking in Persons: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring </p><p>or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use </p><p>of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of </p><p>fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a </p><p>position of vulnerability or the giving or receiving </p><p>of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a </p><p>person having control over another person, for the </p><p>purpose of exploitation.   Exploitation shall include, </p><p>at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of </p><p>others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced </p><p>labor or services, slavery or practices similar to </p><p>slavery, servitude or the removal of organs." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Trafficking in the West and Central African sub- </p><p>region is a term broadly interpreted that can include </p><p>prostitution and the traditional "home-work" or </p><p>placement of children in the informal domestic labor </p><p>sector.  Regarding the sex trade, for the purposes of </p><p>this strategy we will focus on the trafficking of </p><p>girls and women for the sex trade where clear force, </p><p>coercion or deception is involved - avoiding voluntary </p><p>prostitution, which is prevalent throughout the sub- </p><p>region.  We will also focus on transnational child </p><p>trafficking for labor exploitation, such as work on </p><p>cocoa farms in Cote d\'Ivoire, and for domestic </p><p>servitude and work in the informal commercial sector </p><p>in Gabon, Benin and eastern Nigeria.  While the </p><p>placement of children (l\'enfant placement) as domestic </p><p>servants is a form of child labor and fits the UN </p><p>definition of trafficking, it is a complex issue </p><p>tangled in culturally-accepted traditions not lending </p><p>itself to easy and clear-cut definition or simple </p><p>policy formulation.  Indeed, many NGOs and government </p><p>agencies do not accept that the traditional placement </p><p>of children with relatives or friends in their own </p><p>countries in order to provide a child with necessary </p><p>protection and vocational skills is a form of </p><p>trafficking.  Terres des Hommes, an International NGO </p><p>that has worked on child labor and trafficking issues </p><p>for several years throughout West Africa, does not as </p><p>a matter of policy consider "Vidomegon" ("child in </p><p>trust") in Benin, "Trokosi" in Ghana, and similar </p><p>child placement practices elsewhere in the region as </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. In light of this lack of consensus on whether </p><p>intra-national child placement constitutes trafficking </p><p>and the limits on USG resources, this strategy will </p><p>concentrate on the following two forms of trafficking: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Transnational Child Trafficking for Labor; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Child and Women Trafficking for forced commercial </p><p>sexual exploitation (largely Nigeria) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. Background </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. The Intelligence Community is currently working on </p><p>determining the precise number of persons trafficked </p><p>for labor exploitation from and within Africa.  UNICEF </p><p>estimates that approximately 200,000 children are </p><p>trafficked annually within West and Central Africa. </p><p>According to Nigerian and Italian government </p><p>estimates, 7-10,000 Nigerian women and girls are </p><p>trafficked to Italy each year, mostly through </p><p>neighboring West African countries.  An unknown but </p><p>significant number of Nigerian women are trafficked </p><p>for sexual exploitation to other European countries, </p><p>including the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, and the UK. </p><p>These disparate figures reflect the dearth of </p><p>information on the scope and complexity of Africa\'s </p><p>unique trafficking problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. NGOs and international organizations such as the </p><p>ILO and UNICEF report that thousands of children and </p><p>women are trafficked each year within Africa to work </p><p>in domestic services, on agricultural plantations, and </p><p>in the informal sector.  Women and young girls from </p><p>West Africa are trafficked to Europe to work in the </p><p>commercial sex industry and as domestic servants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. Through traditional practices many children are </p><p>encouraged by their parents to leave home in search of </p><p>work, or they are lured away from their homes by </p><p>recruiters with promises of well-paying jobs and a </p><p>brighter future for the children.  The recent </p><p>discovery of a boat destined for Gabon carrying 131 </p><p>West African children (mostly Togolese) is an example </p><p>of how traditional "placement" of children has been </p><p>exploited to subject children, some as young as six </p><p>years old, to travel unaccompanied to jobs in </p><p>neighboring countries.  Such job offers are </p><p>misrepresentations of the type of work they will </p><p>perform.  To add to the complexity of the trafficking </p><p>dynamic is the fact that porous borders make it </p><p>difficult to distinguish between illegal and </p><p>legitimate family cross-border migration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. Trafficking is a complex reality often with </p><p>informal, secretive networks.  West and Central </p><p>African countries can be divided into three major </p><p>categories in the trafficking circuit: "source" or </p><p>"sending" countries, "transit," and "destination" </p><p>countries.  Within the sub-region, Benin, Burkina </p><p>Faso, Ghana, and Nigeria fall into all three </p><p>categories. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Poverty is a common denominator within the West </p><p>and Central African countries that have significant </p><p>trafficking problems.  For families living below the </p><p>poverty line, the motive for sending a child to live </p><p>with friends or relatives to work or to learn trades </p><p>is often economic.  Other factors that contribute to </p><p>the increased incidence of trafficking are the adult </p><p>unemployment rate, insufficient public investment in </p><p>essential economic and social services (especially </p><p>education) and a paucity of vocational and economic </p><p>opportunities for youth in rural areas.  Many families </p><p>are unaware of the risks involved in trafficking, </p><p>including the possibilities of serious maltreatment, </p><p>sexual exploitation, rape, psychological and/or </p><p>physical abuse or the sale of a child by the person </p><p>originally entrusted with him/her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. Country Profiles </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. The following are brief profiles of trafficking in </p><p>key countries of the region: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Benin </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. Benin is a source, transit and destination country </p><p>for trafficked persons, primarily children. </p><p>Trafficking also occurs within Benin.  Beninese </p><p>children are trafficked to Ghana, Nigeria, and Gabon </p><p>for indentured or domestic servitude, work in the </p><p>informal commercial sector, farm labor, and </p><p>prostitution.  Children from Niger, Togo, and Burkina </p><p>Faso have been trafficked to Benin for indentured or </p><p>domestic servitude.  Internal trafficking of children </p><p>in Benin takes place largely in connection with the </p><p>traditional practice called "vidomegon," whereby poor </p><p>families, often from rural areas, place a young child, </p><p>usually a daughter, in the home of a more wealthy </p><p>family to perform services for that family (often for </p><p>as long as ten years, or until the child reaches </p><p>adolescence).  The birth family thus avoids the </p><p>economic burden the child otherwise represents, and </p><p>expects the child to make contacts and develop life </p><p>opportunities that would not have been available in </p><p>their home environment.  This work arrangement is </p><p>different from other forms of child trafficking in </p><p>that videmegon is regarded as a private, voluntary </p><p>agreement directly between the two families. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Burkina Faso </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. Burkina Faso is a source, transit and destination </p><p>country for internationally trafficked persons, </p><p>including children.  Burkina Faso is an occasional </p><p>source country for women who travel to Europe to work </p><p>as domestics but, upon their arrival, are forced into </p><p>sexual exploitation.  Burkina Faso is a transit </p><p>country for trafficked children, notably from Mali. </p><p>Children in transit from Mali are often destined for </p><p>Cote d\'Ivoire.  Trafficked Malian children are also </p><p>destined for Burkina Faso.  Destinations for </p><p>trafficked Burkinabe children include Cote d\'Ivoire, </p><p>Ghana and Nigeria.  In 1999, there were reports of </p><p>trafficked Burkinabe children destined for Germany.  A </p><p>significant number of children are trafficked within </p><p>Burkina Faso. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cameroon </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. Cameroon is a source, transit, and destination </p><p>country for internationally trafficked persons; </p><p>trafficking also occurs within Cameroon.  Children are </p><p>trafficked from and through Cameroon to other West </p><p>African countries for indentured or domestic </p><p>servitude, farm labor, and sexual exploitation.  Women </p><p>are principally trafficked from Cameroon to Europe for </p><p>sexual exploitation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cote d\'Ivoire </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. Cote d\'Ivoire is a source and destination for </p><p>internationally and domestically trafficked persons. </p><p>Trafficking also occurs within Cote d\'Ivoire. </p><p>Ivoirian women and children are trafficked to more </p><p>distant African, European, and Middle Eastern </p><p>countries.  Children are trafficked to Cote d\'Ivoire </p><p>from Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ghana, Benin and Togo </p><p>for indentured or domestic servitude, farm labor, and </p><p>prostitution.  Women are principally trafficked from </p><p>Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, and Asian countries to Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gabon </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. Gabon is a destination country for trafficked </p><p>persons, primarily children from West and Central </p><p>Africa (specifically Benin, Togo and Nigeria) for </p><p>domestic servitude and work in the informal commercial </p><p>sector.   Gabon has a significant immigrant population </p><p>(20% of total population), which serves to increase </p><p>the number of children brought/sent to Gabon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ghana </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. Ghana is a source, transit and destination country </p><p>for trafficked persons, primarily children. </p><p>Trafficking of children for labor and sexual </p><p>exploitation in the informal sector -- as porters, </p><p>shop assistants, in mines and in fishing communities - </p><p>- occurs internally, and sexual and physical abuse of </p><p>these trafficked children occurs.  Trokosi is a form </p><p>of religious servitude for a limited period of time, </p><p>involving work and training in traditional religious </p><p>practices at a fetish shrine in atonement for a crime </p><p>allegedly committed by a member of the girl\'s family. </p><p>Young women are trafficked to Europe and the Middle </p><p>East for sexual exploitation.  Children between the </p><p>ages of 7 and 17 are trafficked to and from the </p><p>neighboring countries of Cote d\'Ivoire, Togo, and </p><p>Nigeria to work as farm workers, laborers or household </p><p>help.   Children trafficked from Burkina Faso transit </p><p>Ghana on the way to Cote d\'Ivoire. </p><p>Guinea </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. Guinea\'s role in the regional trafficking in </p><p>persons appears to be growing as a transit area for </p><p>Nigerian girls and women trafficked to Europe for the </p><p>sex trade.  In July 2001, Guinean police intercepted </p><p>33 Nigerian girls and women in Conakry and arrested 15 </p><p>Nigerian traffickers attempting to smuggle the 33 </p><p>victims to Spain.  (The girls and women were </p><p>repatriated to Nigeria in August and the traffickers </p><p>were extradited to stand trial in Nigeria.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mali </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. Mali is a source and destination country for </p><p>trafficked persons, primarily children.  Children from </p><p>Mali are trafficked to Cote d\'Ivoire to work on cotton </p><p>and cocoa plantations or for domestic servitude. </p><p>Women from Nigeria are trafficked to Mali for sexual </p><p>exploitation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26. Nigeria is a source, transit, and destination </p><p>country for trafficked persons.  The majority of </p><p>trafficking from Nigeria involves females destined for </p><p>Europe; Italian authorities estimate that 18,000 </p><p>Nigerian prostitutes work in Italy, most of them the </p><p>victims of traffickers.  Nigerians, primarily women </p><p>and children, are also trafficked to work on farms or </p><p>as domestic servants in other African countries, </p><p>including Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, </p><p>and Benin.  Other significant destination countries </p><p>for trafficked Nigerians include the Netherlands, the </p><p>Czech Republic, Spain, France and the Middle East. </p><p>Nigeria also serves as a transit hub for trafficking </p><p>in West Africa and to a lesser extent, a destination </p><p>point for young children from nearby West African </p><p>countries.  There is also evidence of trafficking of </p><p>children and women within Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Togo </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. Togo is a source and transit country for </p><p>trafficked persons, primarily children.  Togolese are </p><p>trafficked to Cote d\'Ivoire, Gabon, Nigeria, the </p><p>Middle East (specifically Saudi Arabia and Kuwait), </p><p>and Europe (primarily France and Germany) for </p><p>indentured or domestic servitude, work in the informal </p><p>commercial sector, farm labor and sexual exploitation. </p><p>Children trafficked from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire and Nigeria transit Togo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>The Four Pillars:  Three P\'s and a D </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28. The Africa Bureau\'s strategy for addressing the </p><p>Trafficking in Persons problem in West and Central </p><p>Africa follows the USG\'s strategic framework laid out </p><p>in the President\'s Executive Memorandum of March 11, </p><p>1998.  This international strategy to combat </p><p>Trafficking in Women and Children is commonly referred </p><p>to as the "Three Ps," focusing USG efforts on: A) </p><p>PROSECUTION of traffickers using the enforcement of </p><p>existing laws; B) PREVENTION of trafficking of would- </p><p>be victims in vulnerable source areas; and C) </p><p>PROTECTION of trafficking victims through rescue, </p><p>shelter and reintegration into society.   A fourth </p><p>component of the Bureau strategy is a DIPLOMATIC </p><p>approach targeted to raise the profile of this issue </p><p>with high-level host government officials eliciting </p><p>their support and input in order to enhance but not </p><p>duplicate host governments\' and others\' initiatives. </p><p>This diplomatic effort will precede the start of </p><p>programs to promote Prevention, Prosecution and </p><p>Protection goals and then will be pursued concurrently </p><p>with these efforts. The second component of the </p><p>diplomatic approach would be programmatic and would </p><p>focus efforts to integrate anti-trafficking objectives </p><p>into existing educational, democracy and good </p><p>governance programs (particularly through USAID). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PROSECUTION </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29. The Bureau\'s anti-trafficking strategy for West </p><p>Africa will encourage host governments to develop and </p><p>implement country specific and regional action plans </p><p>to combat trafficking, such as the National Action </p><p>Plan to Combat Trafficking that Mali and Cote d\'Ivoire </p><p>have developed.  In December 2001, the heads of state </p><p>of the Economic Community of West African States </p><p>(ECOWAS) met in Dakar and formally adopted a </p><p>resolution and plan of action to combat Trafficking in </p><p>Persons.  The resolution and plan of action, both of </p><p>which focus on developing uniform laws and enforcement </p><p>efforts, had been developed during a special ECOWAS </p><p>meeting on TIP in Accra October 23-24. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>30. Host governments should be encouraged to structure </p><p>their laws to ensure the effective prosecution of </p><p>those involved in trafficking in persons, distinct </p><p>from any laws punishing those involved in voluntary </p><p>prostitution.  Criminal charges and penalties for </p><p>trafficking in persons - a crime involving coercion, </p><p>force or deception - should be harsher than any crimes </p><p>and penalties associated with prostitution or unforced </p><p>child labor.  Efforts will involve USG programs </p><p>designed to train and strengthen local law enforcement </p><p>and criminal justice systems officials to more </p><p>effectively apprehend and prosecute traffickers, to </p><p>detect victims, and to cooperate regionally in these </p><p>efforts.  Porous borders between countries with </p><p>trafficking problems require training of law </p><p>enforcement and criminal justice official to identify </p><p>potential trafficking victims; e.g. large numbers of </p><p>unaccompanied children.  Such training should also be </p><p>extended to members of ECOWAS along with efforts to </p><p>create an ECOWAS mechanism to unify regional </p><p>enforcement efforts against TIP.  Posts and the Bureau </p><p>should urge ECOWAS to follow up on implementation of </p><p>the December 2001 Plan of Action Against Trafficking </p><p>in Persons adopted at the ECOWAS Heads of State Summit </p><p>in Dakar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PREVENTION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>31. The vast majority of women and children trafficked </p><p>within and out of West and Central Africa come from </p><p>this same region.  Therefore, prevention programs </p><p>designed to address at-risk source areas are key to </p><p>the success of this strategy.  Prevention efforts, </p><p>conducted in concert with host governments, our Peace </p><p>Corps, international and local NGOs, and trade unions, </p><p>will focus on increasing public awareness through a </p><p>culturally appropriate public diplomacy campaign at </p><p>the grass-roots level regarding the dangers of </p><p>trafficking and providing information on the worst </p><p>forms of child labor.  In order to curb the </p><p>trafficking of persons, we need to focus resources on </p><p>vulnerable or at-risk populations, especially young </p><p>women and children before they become trafficking </p><p>victims.  Missions would be asked to work with host </p><p>governments, NGOs and parents, in determining the </p><p>target audience and how best to reach them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>32. Recognizing that a key cause of trafficking lies </p><p>in the lack of alternative economic opportunities, we </p><p>will work through existing DOL and USAID programs to </p><p>help foster workforce development.  This strengthening </p><p>of labor opportunities can take a number of forms, </p><p>including micro-credit schemes, labor market </p><p>information systems, and skills training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>33. In the initial implementation stages of the </p><p>Bureau\'s prevention strategy, the Bureau envisages </p><p>that Public Diplomacy (PD), the Peace Corps, and the </p><p>International Labor Organization (ILO) will be </p><p>instrumental in getting the message out, increasing </p><p>awareness and sensitivity to the issue, and </p><p>identifying country-specific areas where USG </p><p>assistance would be most useful.  NGOs and host </p><p>governments should be encouraged to network with each </p><p>other on best practices and coordinate anti- </p><p>trafficking efforts such as research to study the </p><p>magnitude and incidence of trafficking and trafficking </p><p>patterns.  They should also be encouraged to </p><p>collaborate with government agencies and other NGOs </p><p>doing work in related areas such as micro-credit </p><p>assistance for women, literacy programs and </p><p>legislative reform. </p><p>34. USG programs could provide NGOs with technical </p><p>assistance on grant proposal drafting and on regional </p><p>research and information gathering.  Regional </p><p>cooperation in combating trafficking in women and </p><p>children and providing assistance to victims can be </p><p>facilitated through developing a regional NGO network </p><p>through the Internet, meetings, and workshops.  NGOs </p><p>and law enforcement authorities should be encouraged </p><p>to cooperate to prevent trafficking, to assist </p><p>victims, and to facilitate the apprehension of </p><p>traffickers.  NGOs often have inside information and </p><p>experience that could facilitate the arrest of </p><p>traffickers by local police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PROTECTION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>35. The third part of the Bureau\'s strategy for West </p><p>Africa includes working with host governments and NGOs </p><p>to establish domestic and international protection and </p><p>assistance.  Initiatives such as rescue and </p><p>reintegration projects should be geared toward </p><p>providing trafficking victims with immediate, short- </p><p>term shelter and health care as well as assisting </p><p>governments and local NGOs to build the capacity for </p><p>longer-term shelter and education programs with an aim </p><p>of successfully reintegrating victims into society. </p><p>Working through the International Organization for </p><p>Migration (IOM), we hope to help build a regional </p><p>structure for the efficient repatriation of victims to </p><p>their country of origin from wherever they are </p><p>intercepted.  This would require bilateral </p><p>repatriation agreements and the creation of a regional </p><p>communications network for immigration and police </p><p>authorities to coordinate the transfer of and care for </p><p>trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>36. USG anti-TIP policy, particularly our efforts to </p><p>implement the 2000 Protection of Trafficking Victims </p><p>Acts, needs to be conveyed to governments in the sub- </p><p>region in a clear and consistent fashion. The Regional </p><p>Affairs Office of the AF Bureau will work with posts </p><p>to develop regional and country-specific talking </p><p>points for use in conveying USG anti-TIP goals to host </p><p>governments and regional organizations (e.g. ECOWAS). </p><p>AF/RA will also ensure that the TIP issue is raised </p><p>during bilateral talks with AF governments and the </p><p>governments of relevant European destination </p><p>countries, as appropriate.  Diplomatic efforts will be </p><p>made to encourage governments to ratify the </p><p>Transnational Organized Crime Convention (Palermo </p><p>Convention of December 2000) Protocol on Trafficking </p><p>in Persons.  Working with posts and other bureaus, </p><p>AF/RA will monitor the effectiveness of anti-TIP law </p><p>enforcement efforts in various countries, maintaining </p><p>statistics on arrests and prosecutions of traffickers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Tactical Approach </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>37. In order to best advance the above "Three Ps," </p><p>this strategy will use the following means: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Improved intra-USG donor coordination (led by G/TIP </p><p>and including USAID, DRL, INL, DOL) both at the </p><p>Washington and field levels; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Greater Coordination with International Donors </p><p>(World Bank, the UK\'s Department for International </p><p>Development, the EU and Norway\'s NORAD); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Engagement with/funding of regional organizations </p><p>(ECOWAS) and International Organizations (ILO-IPEC, </p><p>IOM, the UN Center for International Crime Programs-- </p><p>UNCICP, UNICEF); balanced with </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Direct funding for host government and/or local NGOs </p><p>when feasible and deemed most effective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Regional Trafficking Resource Database </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>38. In order to better understand and manage a </p><p>coordinated USG anti-trafficking strategy, it is </p><p>important to have a compendium of up-to-date and </p><p>comprehensive research materials, including data on </p><p>organizations that are addressing the trafficking </p><p>problem and identification of programs that have or </p><p>will be directed against TIP in the region.  A </p><p>regional trafficking resource database, compiled by </p><p>AF/RA and accessible to U.S. Missions and NGOs in the </p><p>region, would include recent reports, surveys, project </p><p>documents, e-mail addresses of key organizations and </p><p>individuals and information on trafficking </p><p>disseminated by the Department\'s Public Diplomacy </p><p>offices.  The information contained in the regional </p><p>trafficking database would be compiled by using </p><p>reputable government and non-government sources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>39. The regional trafficking resource database would </p><p>also hold information on victim assistance needs, </p><p>government responses and programs ranging from law </p><p>enforcement and social protection to indirect programs </p><p>(largely run by USAID) that address the fundamental </p><p>causes of child trafficking and child labor (such as </p><p>lack of education and employment), as well as efforts </p><p>to eliminate the practice of trafficking.  In </p><p>addition, governments and NGOs would benefit by </p><p>sharing information and best practices within the </p><p>region to enhance their approach to the problem and </p><p>facilitate regional efforts.  Ideally, this resource </p><p>database would foster the creation of regional and </p><p>local networks - formal and informal - among NGOs and </p><p>donor governments in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USG Resources </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>40. The AF Bureau will work with posts and other </p><p>Washington agencies (AID and DOL) to develop anti- </p><p>trafficking programs to be funded by ESF, INL and PRM </p><p>funds.  ESF allocations for Africa, in particular, </p><p>will be reviewed systematically for the inclusion of </p><p>anti-TIP programs on a regional and country-specific </p><p>basis.  Posts will coordinate more closely with other </p><p>donors (e.g. DFID, NORAD, and the World Bank) and </p><p>international implementing partners (e.g. UNICEF, ILO- </p><p>IPEC, IOM) to enhance shared funding of trafficking </p><p>programs in the region.  Existing programs in the </p><p>region for primary education, micro-credit, gender </p><p>equality, sustainable agriculture, labor and economic </p><p>development will be reviewed and, where appropriate, </p><p>will adopt anti-trafficking in persons goals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Short-term Objectives (June 2002-December 2002) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Diplomacy </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Raise the trafficking issue with host governments </p><p>within the context of the broad range of bilateral </p><p>relations (just as we have done with HIV/AIDS) to </p><p>ensure that the host governments are aware, on-board </p><p>and committed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Strengthen the anti-trafficking focus of existing </p><p>educational programs like the Education Democracy and </p><p>Development Initiative (EDDI). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Encourage host governments to ratify the UN 2000 </p><p>Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons and the </p><p>December 2001 ECOWAS Resolution and Plan of Action and </p><p>to develop and enact national legislation to prosecute </p><p>traffickers and criminalize both trafficking and </p><p>forced child labor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prevention </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Conduct targeted awareness campaign in identified </p><p>source communities using posters, skits and other </p><p>communications techniques best suited to a largely </p><p>illiterate audience. </p><p>--Create a resource database of anti-trafficking </p><p>offices, organizations and reports, to be available </p><p>via Internet, for U.S. missions and local host country </p><p>counterparts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Encourage NGOs and U.S. agencies that provide </p><p>technical assistance in general to support efforts to </p><p>target TIP source communities, especially in the area </p><p>of secondary education. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prosecution </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Encourage host governments to ratify the UN Protocol </p><p>and the ECOWAS resolution, and to draft and enact </p><p>national legislation criminalizing TIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Provide technical assistance to boost investigative </p><p>and prosecutorial capacity of host government law </p><p>enforcement agencies fighting TIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Protection </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Design and begin implementation of technical </p><p>assistance to host governments to create an effective </p><p>framework for receiving/protecting victims of </p><p>trafficking and reintegrating them into society. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Begin providing seed money (non-recurring costs) for </p><p>the start-up of NGO shelters in source countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Long-Term Objectives (January 2003 - June 2004) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prevention </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Help promote an accountability system to monitor </p><p>various cash crops suspected of involving child labor, </p><p>complementing programs such as the Sustainable Tree- </p><p>Crop Program in Cote d\'Ivoire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Assist host governments\' implementation of </p><p>preexisting goals of universal, compulsory primary </p><p>education at little or no cost to students and their </p><p>families. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Integrate anti-TIP objectives into existing USG </p><p>assistance programs for primary education, micro- </p><p>credit, gender equality, sustainable agriculture, </p><p>labor and economic development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prosecution </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Contingent on the enactment of TIP laws, encourage </p><p>the designation of dedicated and accountable anti-TIP </p><p>law enforcement entities that cooperate within the </p><p>region and work locally with community-based </p><p>watch/prevention groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Encourage expanded prosecution of corrupt officials </p><p>involved in TIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Encourage host governments\' cooperation with US law </p><p>enforcement TIP investigations, such as U.S. Customs </p><p>Service investigations of forced child labor used in </p><p>the production of items destined to become U.S. </p><p>imports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Protection </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Facilitate reintegration of trafficking victims into </p><p>their home settings through specialized school </p><p>programs and vocational training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Strengthen or create a regional network among </p><p>government agencies in the region  for repatriation of </p><p>trafficking victims, probably through IOM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(end) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
