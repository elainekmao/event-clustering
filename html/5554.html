Uwechue said that All </p><p>Nigerian People\'s Party (ANPP) nominee Maj. Gen. (Ret.) </p><p>Mohammedu Buhari is well liked and respected among Northern </p><p>Muslims.  However, Buhari is singularly unpopular with </p><p>Christians and Southerners, making it unlikely that he </p><p>could win the election.  Uwechue did not believe Buhari\'s </p><p>partner on the ticket, former Senate President Chuba </p><p>Okadigbo, and Igbo, would rally many Southerners to the </p><p>ANPP flag.  In the absence of other credible opposition, </p><p>Uwechue thought President Obasanjo would easily win a </p><p>second term. </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
