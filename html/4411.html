As of mid-November, rainfall has been slightly below </p><p>normal over most of the country.  If the rains persist, </p><p>those farmers that have already planted could reap good </p><p>harvests.  Although those farmers that have not yet planted </p><p>can still reap good harvests, they will have less </p><p>flexibility to adjust their planting strategies in response </p><p>to any adverse weather or other conditions.  Generally, seed </p><p>availability is "patchy", depending on the type and location </p><p>of the demand.  The recent increase in seed prices has also </p><p>reduced the amount of seed that farmers can afford.  In </p><p>addition to seed availability, other constraints to </p><p>agricultural productivity include fuel, tillage and </p><p>fertilizer shortages, farm labor and financing constraints, </p><p>the developing El Nino in the Pacific, and a lack of market </p><p>incentives.  While some commercial farmers have been able to </p><p>plant this year, large areas of prime farmland remain idle. </p><p>USAID/DCHA/OFDA supports several programs in Zimbabwe to </p><p>improve food security and expedite agricultural recovery, </p><p>but partner NGOs are also feeling the effects of the </p><p>shortages.  Although still too early for accurate </p><p>projections, the consensus outlook is for another sub- </p><p>standard harvest in April 2003.  The agriculture situation </p><p>in Zimbabwe needs constant monitoring as the final outcome </p><p>will determine the food security situation and additional </p><p>assistance needs for 2003.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Climate </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2. On October 4, the Government Meteorological Department </p><p>(MET) issued a slightly revised forecast for the 2002/03 </p><p>season from the September Southern Africa Regional Climate </p><p>Outlook Forum (SARCOF) prediction.  For the period October </p><p>2002 to December 2003, the revised MET forecast calls for </p><p>normal to below normal rainfall for the entire country (as </p><p>opposed to the earlier SARCOF forecast which split the </p><p>country into northern and southern sections, with slightly </p><p>more optimistic projections for the northern areas).  From </p><p>January to March 2003, all forecasts also call for normal to </p><p>below normal rainfall throughout Zimbabwe.  As of mid- </p><p>November, rainfall has been slightly below normal (80% of </p><p>average) over most of the country.  If the rains persist, </p><p>those farmers that have already planted could reap good </p><p>harvests.  Although those farmers that have not yet planted </p><p>can still reap good harvests, they will have less </p><p>flexibility to pursue more flexible planting strategies, </p><p>such as staggering crops, to better accommodate any adverse </p><p>weather or other conditions. </p><p> </p><p>3. This situation becomes even more critical considering the </p><p>El Nino phenomenon developing in the Pacific Ocean which </p><p>generally has a strong effect on rainfall in southern </p><p>Africa.  The most recent information suggests that this is </p><p>likely to develop into a moderate event during the latter </p><p>part of this year, which could result in sub-normal rainfall </p><p>and agricultural drought in certain parts of the country. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Seed Security </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. Following several successive years of adverse conditions, </p><p>most small-scale farmers have not been able to maintain </p><p>adequate seed stocks, forcing many to turn to the market for </p><p>purchase of these essential inputs.  Generally, seed </p><p>availability varies with type and location.  While good </p><p>quantities of maize seed are still available, sorghum, </p><p>millet, soyabean, and groundnut seed have been sold out by </p><p>most major suppliers.  However, limited quantities of these </p><p>seeds are still available in smaller towns in rural areas, </p><p>as evidenced at recent Catholic Relief Services (CRS) seed </p><p>fairs.  Even with access to seed, the recent increase in </p><p>seed prices - from 120 to more than 300 percent - has </p><p>reduced the amount of seed that farmers can afford.  The </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) and the relief community are </p><p>left to try to make up the deficit. </p><p>5. The government has purchased large quantities of seed for </p><p>delivery to small-scale and resettled farmers.  Reports </p><p>indicate government purchases of 25,000 Metric Tons (MT) of </p><p>maize seed to date.  However, even government admits to </p><p>significant supply shortages, and having to seek additional </p><p>requirements from external sources.  Combined donor- </p><p>assistance via the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization </p><p>(FAO) and NGOs funded by bilateral donors totals 5,983 MT of </p><p>maize seed, 2,829 MT of small grains (sorghum/millet) and </p><p>1,415 MT of cowpeas seed for some 615,000 beneficiary farmer </p><p>households to date.  Although it is still too early for any </p><p>accurate estimates, the total maize seed purchased to date </p><p>(approximately 45,000 MT) is estimated to be able to plant </p><p>an area of about 1.6 million hectares.  At an estimated </p><p>yield of 0.6 to 0.8 Metric Tons (MT) per hectare, this would </p><p>yield between 960,000 and 1,280,000 MT of maize, about 50 to </p><p>70 percent of the national requirement (1.8 million MT). </p><p>The relatively low yield factor is based on a variety of </p><p>additional production constraints discussed below. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>OFDA Partner Programs </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>6. OFDA supports several programs in commercial farming </p><p>areas of Zimbabwe, but not in areas of resettlement, to </p><p>improve food security and expedite agricultural recovery. </p><p>Current OFDA-supported agricultural recovery programs, </p><p>totaling approximately USD 1.6 million, provide for the </p><p>provision of mixed seed baskets (maize, sorghum/millet, </p><p>cowpeas, etc.) to some 200,000 beneficiary farmer households </p><p>by the NGOs CARE, World Vision and CRS.  CARE has managed to </p><p>secure all of the seed required for its program and is in </p><p>the process of transporting it to its distribution end- </p><p>points.  World Vision is seeking sorghum and cowpea seed </p><p>imports from Botswana and South Africa, but has encountered </p><p>delays due to new GOZ requirements for certification that </p><p>imported seed is bio-tech free.  CRS has just completed its </p><p>seed fair program, where small-scale farmers use vouchers to </p><p>purchase seed and other inputs from local and commercial </p><p>seed vendors.  All the NGOs have reported difficulties in </p><p>obtaining adequate fertilizer (which is not eligible for </p><p>funding under USG-financed interventions), as have NGOs in </p><p>neighboring countries. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Production Constraints </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. With delays in oil supply deals and the broader economic </p><p>downturn, fuel shortages are now recurring throughout the </p><p>country.  Long queues and stock-outs at gasoline stations </p><p>are becoming commonplace.  This has begun to impact on </p><p>transportation costs in all sectors of the economy, </p><p>including especially the agricultural sector.  At a recent </p><p>seed fair, several seed vendors and a local NGO helping to </p><p>conduct the fair were late or didn\'t show up at all because </p><p>of the lack of fuel.  Even with access to inputs and the </p><p>capability to plant, commercial farmers are not able to </p><p>maximize their production potential because of the </p><p>increasing cost of operating their farm equipment.  Within </p><p>the smallholder and resettlement sectors, livestock de- </p><p>stocking and disease outbreaks (principally foot-and-mouth </p><p>disease) have significantly reduced draught power available </p><p>for land preparation activities.  Expected support from </p><p>government District Development Fund (DDF) tractors is </p><p>similarly hampered, with more than half of the DDF tractor </p><p>fleet disabled due to lack of spare parts and fuel supplies. </p><p> </p><p>8. Other constraints to agricultural production include </p><p>fertilizer shortages, farm labor and credit constraints, </p><p>pests, and market disincentives.  Low soil fertility in </p><p>small-scale farming areas needs to be improved by manure </p><p>and/or fertilizers.  Chemical fertilizers are in short </p><p>supply due to lack of foreign exchange to pay for imported </p><p>components.  Presently, it is estimated that only 50 percent </p><p>of the requirements are being met.  Even NGOs, which paid </p><p>for fertilizer for their assistance programs weeks ago, </p><p>report having to wait for it to become available as the </p><p>planting "window" passes.  Moreover, like seeds and fuel, </p><p>recent increases in the price of fertilizer have also </p><p>reduced access by many cash-strapped small-scale farmers. </p><p> </p><p>9. In addition to the tillage constraints noted above, farm </p><p>labor is in short supply due both to the upheavals created </p><p>by the resettlement program and the ravages of the HIV/AIDS </p><p>pandemic.  Somewhat ironically, the Minister of Social </p><p>Welfare (July Moyo) acknowledged a lack of skilled farm </p><p>labor (presumably for new "model A2"/commercial resettled </p><p>farmers) in a recent meeting with visiting U.S. General </p><p>Accounting Office (GAO) officials.  And, the impact of the </p><p>HIV/AIDS pandemic is well documented, with an estimated </p><p>800,000 orphans and many more child- and elderly-headed </p><p>households no longer able to meet the physical rigors of </p><p>agricultural cultivation without assistance this year. </p><p> </p><p>10. The lack of economic incentive to grow maize for </p><p>commercial markets, resulting from GOZ price controls on </p><p>major food crops, will also inhibit production.  Financing </p><p>for agricultural production is also limited, as banks are </p><p>hesitant to extend credit to farms under the threat of </p><p>seizure and, in the case of the newly resettled farmers, to </p><p>those who do not possess clear title to land.  And, finally, </p><p>trans-border migratory pests (e.g., armyworms and locusts), </p><p>which tend to be worse following a drought, may also pose </p><p>additional problems for agricultural production this year. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Commercial Farms </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. A limited number of the commercial farmers who have </p><p>managed to maintain possession of their farms have been able </p><p>to plant this year.  Evidence of this is visible along some </p><p>of Zimbabwe\'s major roadways, where maize crops planted in </p><p>early October are now knee-high.  Commercial farm plantings </p><p>observed by OFDA include maize, wheat and tobacco.  However, </p><p>this productive use of commercial farmland is not </p><p>widespread, with large areas of idle land prevalent </p><p>throughout the prime agricultural areas of the country.  An </p><p>estimated 600 large commercial farmers have remained on the </p><p>land and could plant this year; however, given continuing </p><p>insecurity and other constraints, it remains unclear how </p><p>many will actually do so.  Even on those commercial farms </p><p>that can plant, escalating fuel and seed costs, low producer </p><p>prices and continuing security risks will likely limit the </p><p>areas planted to major/controlled food crops.  As a result, </p><p>we can expect a continued slide in production this season in </p><p>this sub-sector. </p><p> </p><p>12. Similarly, crop production on resettled commercial farms </p><p>is also expected to be low this year, as many resettled </p><p>farmers have yet to take up their newly acquired properties </p><p>and/or await finalization of proper "ownership" </p><p>documentation.  In addition, due to the constraints noted </p><p>above, most resettled farmers do not have the resources to </p><p>work these properties (many of which have been previously </p><p>used as grazing land for livestock and, therefore, require </p><p>extensive inputs for preparation for crop cultivation), at </p><p>the same level as the prior commercial owners.  For example, </p><p>one former commercial farmer interviewed by OFDA reported </p><p>that the settlers who took over his farm last year were only </p><p>able to produce 11 tons on the same area that usually </p><p>produced more than 100 tons of maize. </p><p> </p><p>13. Although pastures are generally good, livestock herds </p><p>have been decimated due to the commercial farm seizures.  It </p><p>is reported that the commercial herd has been reduced by two- </p><p>thirds from 1.2 million to 400,000 over the past several </p><p>years.  The resettlement chaos has also resulted in </p><p>significant additional losses in livestock and wildlife due </p><p>to increased theft, poaching and disease outbreaks (e.g., </p><p>foot-and-mouth, anthrax).  The significant reduction in </p><p>livestock herds will have a dramatic impact on the </p><p>availability of meat and dairy products, which is already </p><p>beginning to be felt. </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Conclusions and Recommendations </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. Although it is still early in the season for any </p><p>accurate predictions, Zimbabwe\'s agricultural outlook is </p><p>mixed at best, and much will depend on the adequacy and </p><p>distribution of rainfall in the coming months.  However, </p><p>even with sufficient rainfall the prospects for an adequate </p><p>season are poor, given the plethora of land, fuel, tillage, </p><p>labor, market, input and other production constraints noted </p><p>above.  The relief community is trying to fill the gaps, but </p><p>even with the means, the shortages throughout the country </p><p>are making this extremely difficult.  The net result is </p><p>another sub-standard harvest expected in April 2003. </p><p> </p><p>15. The agricultural situation in Zimbabwe needs constant </p><p>monitoring as the outcome will determine the food security </p><p>situation and additional assistance needs for 2003.  The </p><p>agricultural recovery process should be expedited, and </p><p>contingency plans for planting alternative crops put in </p><p>place.  Due to the difficulties of procuring seed - a </p><p>situation which is expected to worsen considerably next year </p><p>as a result of the effects of the resettlement program - </p><p>NGOs should develop their plans and begin joint preparations </p><p>for next season\'s agricultural requirements now.
