<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 LAGOS 000148 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT OF ENERGY FOR CAROLYN GAY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, ECON, EPET, EINV, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/IP/AF, DS/DSS/OSAC </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  NOT ONLY GAS FLARES IN NIGERIA, ITS\' </p><p>PETROLEUM HEADQUARTERS BUILDING ALSO BURNS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 241213Z </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND ( </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary: Arson is strongly suspected in the December </p><p>24 fire that </p><p>destroyed the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) </p><p>headquarters and </p><p>records. The fire followed by barely a week a newspaper </p><p>article asserting </p><p>that there is solid, extensive and documented proof that GON </p><p>officials have been </p><p>stealing much of Nigeria\'s oil revenue.  The leader of a </p><p>previously unknown </p><p>group, the Young Democratic Movement YDM claimed </p><p>responsibility for the </p><p>fire, citing "unhappiness with the GON" as the impetus.  He </p><p>and his attorney have </p><p>since been arrested.  The GON has announced there will be </p><p>investigations, but </p><p>observers do not expect anyone to be charged or punished as a </p><p>result.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>WHAT HAPPENED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During the evening of December 24, fire gutted the </p><p>NNPC\'s Lagos </p><p>headquarters building, which was located on Ikoyi Island in </p><p>Lagos.  Deputy </p><p>Police Commissioner (DPC), Haruna John (Please protect </p><p>accordingly.), </p><p>told  CG and Econoff that the fire began on the eighth floor, </p><p>where the </p><p>offices of the Nigerian Petroleum Investment Management </p><p>Services </p><p>(NAPIM) were located.  NAPIM manages the GON\'s joint ventures </p><p>with international oil companies (Shell, Mobil, Chevron, </p><p>AGIP, </p><p>Elf, and Texaco).  A second fire later ignited on the second </p><p>floor of the building, where the Pipelines and Products </p><p>Marketing Company </p><p>(PPMC) was housed.  PPMC sells diesel fuel, gasoline, </p><p>kerosene, aviation </p><p>kerosene, and similar products.  PPMC recently began </p><p>importing fuel in </p><p>response to a shortfall on the local market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Observers noted the slow response of the fire </p><p>department to the fire. </p><p>The fire fighters who arrived first at the scene did so at </p><p>least an hour after </p><p>the blaze had started.  According to the DPC, firemen </p><p>initially refused to </p><p>respond to the blaze until he personally dispatched policemen </p><p>to the fire </p><p>stations with orders to arrest firemen who refused to go. </p><p>When the firemen </p><p>eventually arrived on site, they lacked the proper equipment </p><p>and had to wait for </p><p>a water tanker.  Hours later, a second blaze started on the </p><p>second floor, six </p><p>floors down from the first fire, and consumed the rest of the </p><p>building. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>WHY HERE AND WHY NOW? </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>4. (U) On December 17, 2002, Barth Obi Oyibo Thompson of Abia </p><p>State placed a </p><p>three-page statement in the "Vanguard", a widely read </p><p>Lagos-based newspaper.  He </p><p>began the article by establishing  his ties to President </p><p>Obasanjo and Andrew Young </p><p>among others and his credentials as a petroleum industry </p><p>expert.  Claiming a </p><p>commitment to Nigeria and to President Olusegun Obasanjo, </p><p>Thompson wrote </p><p>that he was compelled to expose ongoing  fraud and theft of </p><p>Nigeria\'s </p><p>petroleum revenue through under-reporting of exports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Oyibo Thompson purported to have at least fifteen </p><p>years of documentary </p><p>history on Nigeria\'s oil exports, and stated that he had </p><p>extensive supportive </p><p>data to prove his claim of fraud. He went on that it has been </p><p>an open secret for </p><p>sometime that "an unidentified West African country" has been </p><p>under-reporting </p><p>its oil exports.  According to Thompson, this fact allegedly </p><p>explains why the World </p><p>Bank reports that less than 45% of  Nigeria\'s oil export </p><p>proceeds end up funding </p><p>Nigeria\'s federal budget.  Oyibo Thompson concluded his </p><p>accusation by calling on </p><p>President Obasanjo, whom he considers an honorable man, to </p><p>identify the culprits </p><p>and resolve the problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment. Post has learned from Chuka Odom, Deputy </p><p>Chief of Staff for Abia </p><p>State (Please protect accordingly), that "Barth Obi Oyibo </p><p>Thompson" is probably an alias. </p><p>Our contact has not been able to locate anyone in Abia State </p><p>who knows this </p><p>Oyibo Thompson but, he surmised that  "Thompson" was a senior </p><p>NNPC official </p><p>or a disgruntled employee who definitely had access to </p><p>information.  Our man </p><p>further speculated that "Thompson" probably did not work </p><p>alone, and that other </p><p>persons inside NNPC were feeding him information.  The </p><p>reference to Obasanjo </p><p>as an "honorable man" may be a subtle hint to the President </p><p>to "do the right thing," </p><p>our source said.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>WHO DID IT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Chris Nwozobia, leader of the previously unknown Youth </p><p>Democratic </p><p>Movement (YDM), has claimed responsibility for the fire.  He </p><p>reportedly said he </p><p>set the building afire because of "unhappiness with the </p><p>performance of the Federal </p><p>Government".  Nwozobia told the media that his group, based </p><p>in Lagos, has members </p><p>throughout the country.  Nwozobia turned himself over to </p><p>State Security headquarters. </p><p>Nwozobia and his attorney, Festus Keyamo, were later arrested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Deputy Police Commissioner told us on January 8 </p><p>that it is unlikely </p><p>that the YDM had a direct hand in the fire.  If it was </p><p>involved at all, it was </p><p>probably at the instigation of some person or group in an </p><p>effort to cover up </p><p>unethical practices at NNPC. He asserted that it would not </p><p>have been unusual </p><p>for such a group to be hired by a third party for such an </p><p>act. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Many observers think the fire was an inside job by </p><p>persons interested in </p><p>covering their tracks following wrongdoing.  The fire began </p><p>on the eighth floor, </p><p>where  important documents relating to GON investments were </p><p>kept including </p><p>joint venture contracts and production sharing agreements </p><p>which may yield billions </p><p>of dollars in revenue to the GON. The projects cover </p><p>pipelines, oil field </p><p>services, supply production facilities, and field </p><p>development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Among the documents on this floor were those relating </p><p>to cash calls. The </p><p>GON recently paid 24 billion naira (approximately 240 million </p><p>USD) in cash call </p><p>arrears dating to the Abacha years (1994-99). The oil </p><p>companies and the GON </p><p>disagree on the exact amount of the U.S. dollars owed for </p><p>that period. The GON </p><p>says it owes the international oil companies 300 million USD, </p><p>the companies say </p><p>500 million USD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Documents relating to the daily sale of petroleum </p><p>products were located </p><p>on the second floor where fire also broke out.  Since the </p><p>NNPC\'s consignees </p><p>typically obtain 30-day credit from the company, some of the </p><p>documents that </p><p>burned may have been essential to a determination of the </p><p>exact amount owed </p><p>to the NNPC.  Current data on fuel imported or refined </p><p>locally was also lost. </p><p>12. (C) On January 13 Econoff met with Chuka Odom, Chief of </p><p>Staff of the </p><p>Governor of Abia State, who opined that the government will </p><p>most probably </p><p>never determine the cause of the blaze.  Odom pointed out </p><p>that ninety percent </p><p>of Nigeria\'s foreign revenue derives from the oil sector, yet </p><p>this is the only sector </p><p>without a cabinet ministry.  Odom asserted that almost any </p><p>senior GON official </p><p>now has unrestricted, and possibly undocumented, access to </p><p>NNPC records. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>LIKELY OUTCOME </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Many Nigerians ad public officials have called for a </p><p>thorough </p><p>investigation of the fire.  President Obasanjo, noting the </p><p>loss of vital oil </p><p>sector documents, established a panel of inquiry and the </p><p>police and fire </p><p>departments are also investigating the fire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The Deputy Police Commissioner said a police panel </p><p>comprising as </p><p>many as fifteen persons is investigating the matter, but he </p><p>expects no significant </p><p>findings.  According to him, senior officials are not </p><p>interested in the truth. </p><p>Although asked to be a member of the investigative panel, </p><p>the DPC said he </p><p>refused to join, fearing reprisals if the investigation were </p><p>done correctly and </p><p>preferring not to be involved if it were botched.   "It would </p><p>be politically and </p><p>professionally foolhardy," he said, " to uncover and expose </p><p>the perpetrator if that </p><p>person is moneyed or high-powered. This could result in death </p><p>to the person who </p><p>reveals the wrong-doing." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>WHAT NOW NNPC </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The GON was not the only loser as a result of the </p><p>inferno.  The </p><p>headquarters\' 200 employees found themselves potentially </p><p>jobless on </p><p>Christmas Day.  NNPC office workers are temporarily housed at </p><p>the </p><p>headquarters\' guest quarters but some employees, such as </p><p>domestics, are </p><p>now unemployed.  Because of crime in Lagos, many NNPC </p><p>employees kept </p><p>passports, school certificates, money and jewelry at their </p><p>offices and  will </p><p>find it difficult to replace these items. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (U)  An AmCit oil company executive told ConGen that  the </p><p>oil companies </p><p>have copies of documents pertinent to their businesses at </p><p>their offices in  Nigerian </p><p>and abroad at their corporate headquarters.  NNPC should have </p><p>copies of these </p><p>documents in their Abuja offices, however, NNPC will most </p><p>likely look to the </p><p>oil companies to fill in the gaps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) Comment.  NNPC may have suffered a blow to its </p><p>reputation, which </p><p>was not high in any event.  Many people suspect the </p><p>authorities will never </p><p>disclose the real cause of the fire.  Lagos has a long </p><p>history of unsolved fires </p><p>gutting government properties.  For example, the Defense </p><p>Building burnt in </p><p>1991 during a probe of its activities.  Nigeria External </p><p>Telecommunications (NET) </p><p>building burnt twenty years ago as the result of a fire in </p><p>the accounts department. </p><p>Its reconstruction has been in progress for as many years. </p><p>Odua, an investment </p><p>group comprising  five southwestern states,  has lost two of </p><p>their buildings to </p><p>fires in the last seven years.       The skeptics say that </p><p>NNPC will continue to </p><p>conduct business as usual, even if from temporary quarters, </p><p>and the memory </p><p>of the fire and destroyed records will fade.  Long-time Lagos </p><p>residents say </p><p>the various investigating panels will produce reports, but </p><p>these will never be </p><p>released to the public.  Panel members might legitimately </p><p>fear for their personal </p><p>safety if they were to delve too deeply into the </p><p>circumstances of what really </p><p>happened on Christmas eve. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
