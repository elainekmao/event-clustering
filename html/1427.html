(C) MOST MAJOR OPPOSITION LEADERS HAVE SAID THAT THEY </p><p>WON\'T GO TO LIBREVILLE TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT KABILA ON </p><p>DECEMBER 21, AND CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT ALL INITIATIVES FOR </p><p>THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE SHOULD BE PURSUED WITHIN THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK OF THE LUSAKA ACCORDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DURING A MEETING WITH POLOFF DECEMBER 18, THOMAS </p><p>OTSHUDI, LEGAL ADVISOR TO FONUS (NEW FORCES FOR UNION AND </p><p>SOLIDARITY) PRESIDENT JOSEPH OLENGHANKOY, REPORTED THAT NO </p><p>ONE FROM FONUS WOULD ATTEND THE PROPOSED SUMMIT.  HE CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THE KABILA GOVERNMENT HADN\'T EVEN CALLED WITH AN </p><p>INVITATION, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MEETING WAS ONLY THREE </p><p>DAYS AWAY, AND ACCUSED KABILA OF ATTEMPTING TO CREATE THE </p><p>ILLUSION THAT HE IS REACHING OUT TO THE OPPOSITION.  (NOTE: </p><p>OLENGHANKOY IS ONE OF THE FEW OPPOSITION LEADERS WHO REMAIN </p><p>IN KINSHASA, SINCE MOST OF THE OTHER MAJOR FIGURES HAVE FLED. </p><p>END NOTE.)

OLENGHANKOY\'S LEGAL ADVISOR </p><p>ALSO OFFERED HIS VIEW THAT KABILA\'S PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION </p><p>ON THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE HAD NO AUTHORITY UNDER THE </p><p>LUSAKA ACCORDS TO BRING PARTIES TOGETHER OR EVEN PARTICIPATE </p><p>IN THE DIALOGUE, SINCE THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN </p><p>NAMED BY KABILA HIMSELF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) OTHER OPPOSITION LEADERS HAVE MADE THEIR POSITIONS </p><p>PLAIN IN THE PRESS.  CHRISTOPHE LUTUNDULA OF MSDD (SOLIDARITY </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT) IS QUOTED IN "LE </p><p>POTENTIEL" AS STATING THAT ALL INITIATIVES FOR A NATIONAL </p><p>DIALOGUE MUST COME FROM WITHIN THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY (PDSC) ECHOED THIS </p><p>BELIEF IN A PRESS RELEASE.  ARMED OPPOSITION LEADER </p><p>JEAN-PIERRE BEMBA HAS STATED PUBLICLY FOR SOME TIME THAT HE </p><p>WON\'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY DIALOGUE WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION </p><p>OF FACILITATOR KETUMILE MASIRE. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
