<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001630 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO DOT FOR SAMPLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAID, SENV, EWWT, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: DOT TEAM VISIT - PROGRAM IS ON COURSE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  A DOT team led by Senior Policy Advisor Kevin </p><p>Sample visited Nigeria April 13-26 to complete security and </p><p>environmental assessments at the Lagos Port Complex and to </p><p>discuss privatization of port services in Nigeria.  The DOT </p><p>officials met the Senate Committee on Marine Transport, </p><p>officials of the Bureau of Private Enterprises (the GON </p><p>privatization agency), and the Ministry of Transport.  The </p><p>team recommended that privatization of port services follow a </p><p>phased approach, emphasizing the need to include labor in the </p><p>planning and implementation process.  The GON appears </p><p>committed to port privatization, although much work remains </p><p>before Nigeria can become a regional maritime hub.  Problems </p><p>include the current policy of 100% port inspections and the </p><p>need to develop an adequate internal transportation </p><p>infrastructure. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Meeting With Senate Committee on Marine Transport </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On April 17, the DOT team briefed the Senate Committee on </p><p>Marine Transport on their mission in Nigeria, which was well </p><p>received by the Committee.  Committee members agreed port </p><p>services needed to become more efficient and container </p><p>handling costs reduced for Nigeria to become a maritime hub </p><p>in West Africa, and that the best avenue to increase </p><p>efficiency and lower costs would be through private sector </p><p>participation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  DOT Senior Advisor Kevin Sample advised that port </p><p>privatization should be a phased process, involving training </p><p>and re-absorption of labor into the general workforce, with </p><p>the eventual aim of reducing labor opposition to </p><p>privatization.  The Senators agreed with Sample that </p><p>privatization should not be rushed, and requested USG </p><p>assistance in the retraining of redundant port workers.  The </p><p>Committee emphasized that port privatization is politically </p><p>sensitive due to the fear that workers would be laid-off and </p><p>unemployment would rise.  Sample advised that maritime </p><p>workers should be included in the privatization decision </p><p>process in order to harmonize the views of all stakeholders </p><p>and minimize problems. He also believed the GON should </p><p>emphasize that only selected services at the ports should be </p><p>privatized, not the entire port.  The Senators thought that </p><p>"private sector participation" instead of "privatization" was </p><p>a more apt and palatable term. Sample said DOT might be able </p><p>to assist by organizing a tour of the Mexican ports in </p><p>collaboration with the World Bank, for the Nigerian officials </p><p>as an example of a successful port privatization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Sample also advocated creation of a mechanism to reduce </p><p>corruption in the maritime sector and to ensure that maritime </p><p>sector funding is applied judiciously. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Meeting With Minister of Transport </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  In the meeting with the Minister of Transport Chief Ojo </p><p>Maduekwe and other top Ministry officials, the fight against </p><p>corruption was reiterated.  The Minister thanked the U.S </p><p>government for assisting in training officials of his </p><p>Ministry on anti-corruption, and asked for more of such </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The Minister explained his plans to visit Washington June </p><p>3-11 and asked for DOT assistance in scheduling appointments </p><p>with USG officials.  Sample agreed to put together a program, </p><p>including a visit to some U.S. ports and a meeting with </p><p>Secretary Mineta.  The Minister praised the efforts of the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DOT in helping Nigeria\'s transportation sector, and asked for </p><p>continued cooperation between the GON and DOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Meeting With Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  The DOT team also met officials of BPE, the GON </p><p>privatization agency.  Sample explained DOT\'s current mission </p><p>in Nigeria and offered assistance in privatizing port </p><p>services.  The port privatization team leader Hassan Usman, </p><p>stressed that privatization of port services is on course </p><p>using the "Landlord Port Model."  Usman said BPE was hosting </p><p>workshops to sensitize state governments, labor and civil </p><p>society on port privatization, and reiterated BPE,s aim to </p><p>privatize the port services of one of Nigeria\'s eight ports </p><p>before the end of the year.  Sample advised that labor should </p><p>be fully involved in the privatization process to ensure a </p><p>smooth transition.  Usman agreed, commenting that this was </p><p>the goal of the workshops as was evident from the communiqu </p><p>adopted by stakeholders at one of the workshop sessions. </p><p>Sample also advised that port privatization should not be </p><p>rushed, but rather be a phased process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  The DOT technical team offered to assist the BPE in </p><p>training officials, and resolved to work closely with the BPE </p><p>to ensure a successful privatization of port services.  Usman </p><p>welcomed DOT\'s offer of assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.    The GON\'s resolve to privatize selected port services </p><p>was clearly evident throughout the visit to Abuja.  However, </p><p>at the Lagos Port Complex the issue of privatization is so </p><p>sensitive that Nigerian Port Authority (NPA) managers refused </p><p>to discuss the topic in the presence of NPA junior staff.  In </p><p>addition, the GON must surmount a number of other hurdles if </p><p>port services are to become more efficient and less corrupt. </p><p>Nigerian ports also have often been sites of violent labor </p><p>protests-- usually involving privately hired dock workers. </p><p>Several weeks before the DOT team\'s visit one such protest </p><p>sparked a disturbance at the Lagos Port, and reportedly </p><p>authorities are yet to put in place an effective system to </p><p>handle these volatile situations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.   The issue of immediate concern to port managers is the </p><p>June 2001 policy of 100% inspection.  This policy has </p><p>increased average clearance time from 20 to over 30 days, and </p><p>NPA officials claim 100% inspection "will only lead to </p><p>disaster."  They point to increased stress on equipment </p><p>caused by repetitive repositioning of containers, and also </p><p>allege 100% inspection fuels corruption.  NPA officials </p><p>explained that the more hands that come in contact with a </p><p>container the more opportunities for pilferage and bribery </p><p>(the more difficult the clearance process the more "dash" </p><p>required to smooth the way). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.   Port officials are searching for alleviation to 100% </p><p>inspection, but for now the GON appears intent on maintaining </p><p>this controversial policy.  Meanwhile, the Lagos container </p><p>terminal is reportedly home to an estimated 1,000 abandoned </p><p>containers left over from the initial days of 100% </p><p>inspection. No one wants to step forward to claim spoiled </p><p>foodstuffs, or in certain cases -- illicit or undervalued </p><p>goods. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.   Many observers opine that if Nigeria is to become a </p><p>regional maritime hub, port services have to be delivered in </p><p>a more efficient way, corruption must be eradicated at the </p><p>ports, and labor unrest at the ports must be curtailed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
