(C) On March 18, DART Field Office/North facilitated the </p><p>first coordination meeting among Non-Governmental </p><p>Organizations (NGOs), the United Nations (U.N.), and USG </p><p>humanitarian personnel in Ankara, Turkey.  Representatives </p><p>from ten NGOs were in attendance, namely: Mercy Corps </p><p>International (MCI), Action Against Hunger/France (ACF), </p><p>International Medical Corps (IMC), Oxfam/UK, Northwest </p><p>Medical Team (NWMT), American Red Cross (AmRC), World Relief, </p><p>CARE International, International Rescue Committee (IRC), and </p><p>Save the Children/US (SCF/US).  U.N. High Commissioner for </p><p>Refugees (UNHCR) and the U.N. Office for the Coordination for </p><p>Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) officials were in attendance </p><p>on behalf of the U.N.  Four DART Field Office/North members </p><p>and the Embassy MDRO took part in the coordination meeting on </p><p>behalf of the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The two-hour meeting covered overall humanitarian </p><p>coordination issues, the reluctance of the U.N. to facilitate </p><p>future meetings, and an opportunity for NGOs to outline the </p><p>steps they have taken to register with the Government of </p><p>Turkey (GOT), as well as provide information on the sectors </p><p>that they are focusing on.  NGOs expressed the need to </p><p>continue these coordination meetings on a regular basis, and </p><p>DART Field Office/North will facilitate a second coordination </p><p>meeting the morning of March 22.  Additionally, the NGO </p><p>community expressed the desire to meet with U.S. military </p><p>personnel to discuss the dissemination of information on </p><p>security issues.  NGOs are also seeking information on </p><p>organizations that will respond to a potential Chemical or </p><p>Biological attack on civilian populations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>U.N. Reluctance to Coordinate NGO Meetings </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>3. (C) UN OCHA is willing to track the transit and </p><p>registration process and lobby on behalf on NGOs with the GOT </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  However, UN OCHA </p><p>indicated that they are unable, at this time, to coordinate </p><p>any meetings with unregistered NGOs because the GOT insists </p><p>that only registered NGOs participate in U.N. facilitated </p><p>coordination meetings.   UN OCHA stressed they are willing to </p><p>continue to </p><p>be an observer at future NGO coordination discussions. </p><p>Several NGOs voiced concern over the U.N.,s reluctance to </p><p>host future NGO coordination meetings, and UNHCR and UN OCHA </p><p>indicated </p><p>that they would take the issue up with the U.N. Resident </p><p>Coordinator.  DART Field Office/North urged U.N. </p><p>representatives to host NGO coordination meetings for issued </p><p>related to humanitarian assistance in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Current Registration Process </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>4. (U) Based on information provided by NGOs during the </p><p>coordination meeting, NGOs, in addition to applying for a </p><p>transit permit and registration license, must now submit a </p><p>request to the MFA for a crisis permit as well.  NGOs voiced </p><p>frustration that the process for providing humanitarian </p><p>assistance now requires three separate applications; transit, </p><p>registration, and crisis permits.  NGOs asked if UN OCHA </p><p>could provide guidance to all organizations seeking to </p><p>register with the GOT.  UN OCHA is discussing the matter </p><p>internally and will provide an update at the next </p><p>coordination meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Update on the NGO Registration Process </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>5. (U) Each NGO presented a brief overview of the status of </p><p>their registration with the MFA, as well as some indication </p><p>of the area and/or sectors that they are focusing on: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A.    International Rescue Committee ) IRC submitted both </p><p>their transit permit and registration documents to the MFA on </p><p>March 10.  They are looking at providing assistance to </p><p>northern Iraq, with a focus on primary health, children,s </p><p>issues, and water and sanitation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.    International Medical Corps ) IMC submitted both a </p><p>transit and registration application to the MFA on March 12. </p><p>They would like to focus on primary health care and health </p><p>education in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.    Mercy Corps International ) MCI just arrived in Ankara </p><p>and is working to draft transit and registration materials to </p><p>submit to the MFA.  MCI indicated that they have a strong </p><p>working relationship with Peace Winds/Japan, an international </p><p>NGO currently working in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.    Action Against Hunger ) ACF has no plans to establish </p><p>an office or transit goods through Turkey.  ACF sent a </p><p>representative to Ankara in case of a refugee crisis within </p><p>Turkey and they will focus on nutrition if such a crisis </p><p>presents itself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.    Oxfam/UK ) Oxfam/UK is in discussions with UNHCR to </p><p>provide emergency water and sanitation services in refugee </p><p>camps on the Turkish side of the border.  If the Turkish </p><p>military plans on crossing the border, Oxfam/UK made it very </p><p>clear that they will not apply for a transit permit with the </p><p>MFA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F.    Northwest Medical Team ) NWMT applied for a transit </p><p>permit on March 18 and will focus on primary health concerns </p><p>beyond any potential Turkish buffer zone in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G.    American Red Cross ) AmRC has had a relationship with </p><p>the Turkish Red Crescent for three years and is in a position </p><p>to provide technical assistance to the Red Crescent if needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H.    World Relief ) World Relief is submit their </p><p>registration documents with the MFA, but has yet to do so. </p><p>They are not looking at transiting goods through Turkey, but </p><p>intend to establish an office to provide technical assistance </p><p>to </p><p>local NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I.    CARE International ) CARE arrived in Ankara on March </p><p>16 and is looking into the possibility of obtaining both a </p><p>transit permit and registration license. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Future Coordination Meetings </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>6. (C) NGOs expressed the need to continue coordination </p><p>meetings on a regular basis.  Due to the U.N.,s reluctance </p><p>to facilitate meetings with unregistered organizations, DART </p><p>Field Office/North will facilitate a second coordination </p><p>meeting on March 22.  Additionally, the NGO community </p><p>expressed the desire to meet with U.S. Military personnel </p><p>on March 22 to discuss the dissemination of information on </p><p>security issues.  NGOs are also seeking information on </p><p>organizations that will respond to a potential CBRNE attack </p><p>on civilian populations.  DART Field Office/North is </p><p>attempting to arrange for U.S. military personnel to meet </p><p>with NGOs and is seeking guidance from OFDA/Washington on </p><p>Chemical and Biological response concerns through separate </p><p>channels. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
