Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: The UAE Government is </p><p>at the forefront of protecting intellectual property </p><p>rights (IPR) in the region.  As part and parcel </p><p>of its development into a regional trading center, </p><p>the UAE Government has made the protection of </p><p>intellectual property a priority in recent years. </p><p>New copyright, trademark and patent laws, passed in </p><p>2002, provide high levels of protection for U.S. </p><p>intellectual property, while an agreement -- brokered </p><p>by the Embassy in 2002 -- continues to provide </p><p>TRIPs-plus levels of protection for U.S. </p><p>pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the UAE has undertaken </p><p>a massive public relations and enforcement effort </p><p>against counterfeiting and routinely destroys copy-cat </p><p>goods in large public events.  UAE authorities cooperate </p><p>closely with U.S. business to prevent counterfeiting of </p><p>trademarked goods.  Based on its solid record on IPR </p><p>protection, we strongly recommend that the UAE remain </p><p>off the Special 301 Watchlist this year.  End summary </p><p>and comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>UAEG Enacts Laws To Protect IPR in 2002 </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The UAEG repealed previous copyright, trademark, </p><p>and patent laws and issued improved legislation in 2002 </p><p>in harmony with international standards and exceeding </p><p>the UAE\'s TRIPs obligations.  The new Copyright Law, </p><p>enacted in July 2002, is the product of a prolonged </p><p>dialog between the UAEG and international organizations </p><p>such as WIPO and the WTO.  It grants protections to </p><p>authors of creative works and expands the categories of </p><p>protected works, to include computer programs, software, </p><p>databases, and other digital works. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Business Software Alliance (BSA) issued a </p><p>press release in July that the "new copyright law confirms </p><p>the UAE as the region\'s standard bearer of intellectual </p><p>property rights...The regular view and revision of </p><p>copyright laws sends a clear message to international </p><p>companies that these laws are real and are part of an </p><p>active policy to protect IP rights [in the UAE]." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The UAE\'s new Trademark Law, also issued in July </p><p>2002, confirms that the UAE will follow the International </p><p>Classification System and that one trademark can be </p><p>registered in a number of classes.  The new law provides </p><p>that the owner of the registration shall enjoy exclusive </p><p>rights to the use of the trademark as registered and can </p><p>prevent others from using an identical or similar mark on </p><p>similar, identical or related products and services if </p><p>it causes confusion among consumers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The UAE Government published the official and </p><p>final version in November 2002 of the long-awaited Patent </p><p>Law.  Specifically, the Patent Law provides for -- in </p><p>accordance with the UAE\'s TRIPs obligations -- national </p><p>treatment for IP owners in other WTO Member States, both </p><p>product and process patent protection, and enforcement </p><p>of IPR whereby civil and criminal procedures and remedies </p><p>may be employed. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Sustained Patent Protection For U.S. Pharmaceuticals </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In March 2002, the UAE Ministries of Health and </p><p>Finance and Industry conveyed in writing their acceptance </p><p>of PhRMA\'s "best and final offer" under which 25 U.S. </p><p>patent-protected, innovative products would be afforded </p><p>5-year data exclusivity protection. Under the terms of </p><p>the agreement which PhRMA and the UAEG accepted, all </p><p>other U.S.-patented drugs, whether pending registration </p><p>or not, will be given data exclusivity protection in </p><p>the UAE market equal to the patent term -- a major </p><p>commitment which puts the UAE well beyond its minimal </p><p>WTO TRIPs obligations. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The written assurances of the Ministries of </p><p>Health and Finance ensure that no/no unauthorized copies </p><p>of U.S. patent-protected medicines will be registered in </p><p>the UAE.  That agreement is still holding firm and, in </p><p>fact, the UAE has even refused to register copies of </p><p>the 18 innovative pharmaceutical products that PhRMA </p><p>agreed to allow local firm Julphar to produce in order </p><p>to secure that agreement. </p><p>The bottom- line remains that U.S. pharmaceutical products </p><p>continue to enjoy TRIPs-plus levels of protection here. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Continuing Crackdown On Counterfeit Goods </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The UAE authorities are well aware of the danger </p><p>to legitimate commerce posed by counterfeiting, particularly </p><p>of safety-related items such as automobile spare parts and </p><p>tires.  The government has conducted a public awareness </p><p>campaign warning consumers of the dangers of buying fake </p><p>automotive components, and industry has also been active </p><p>in this respect.  A few examples include: </p><p>-- The Dubai and Sharjah Police have conducted a series </p><p>of raids on "chop-shop" counterfeit parts distributors </p><p>during the last year. </p><p>-- The Dubai Chamber of Commerce (DCCI) has established </p><p>a Fake Parts Committee regarding counterfeit auto parts, </p><p>in partnership with local auto-industry representatives </p><p>including General Motors, AC Delco, Daimler Chrysler. </p><p>More generally, the DCCI has embarked on a publicity </p><p>campaign to heighten consumer awareness regarding </p><p>counterfeit auto parts. </p><p> </p><p>-- Sharjah Municipality has destroyed empty boxes that </p><p>contained international trademarks of car spare parts </p><p>(e.g., the empty boxes were to be filled with bogus </p><p>parts, deceiving the consumer).  Sharjah Municipality </p><p>has also established an emergency phone hotline to </p><p>report fake spare parts. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Regular articles in the local dailies of raids </p><p>and arrests of counterfeiters indicate that the authorities </p><p>take seriously their responsibility to reduce the trade </p><p>of other counterfeit consumer products, as well.  Penalties </p><p>for IPR violations include destruction of the counterfeit </p><p>goods, destruction of the counterfeiting equipment, fines, </p><p>imprisonment, and publication of judgment.  The following </p><p>are a few recent examples: </p><p> </p><p>-- The Gulf News reported in August 2002 that raids by the </p><p>UAE Ministry of Information led to the conviction of 34 IT </p><p>resellers in Dubai who were dealing in illegal software. </p><p>The authorities confiscated 47 PCs, which were loaded with </p><p>copies of Windows 98, Windows XP, Office XP, and Adobe </p><p>Photoshop.  Dubai police raided several warehouses and </p><p>seized equipment used for copying software CDs and more </p><p>than 205,000 pirated CDs. </p><p> </p><p>-- Dubai Customs in July 2002 destroyed 1.5 million pieces </p><p>of counterfeit CDs, 16 tons of illegal medicines, 840 </p><p>satellite decoder cards and 1,377 cartons of fake </p><p>cigarettes.  According to press reports, customs </p><p>inspectors discovered the items while they were passing </p><p>through either cargo or passenger inspections at various </p><p>air, sea and land entry points across Dubai.  Dubai </p><p>Customs inspectors undertake continuous training programs </p><p>in order to identify suspected illegal activities and use </p><p>the latest equipment for uncovering and seizing </p><p>counterfeit goods. </p><p> </p><p>-- In July 2002, Sharjah Municipality confiscated and </p><p>destroyed 799 cartons of fake cigarettes carrying the </p><p>Marlboro trademark.  Sharjah officials said that, in some </p><p>cases, the agent notifies the Municipality about the </p><p>location of fake products and sometimes people report </p><p>offenders.  The Municipality also employs undercover </p><p>agents, disguised as customers, to visit shops and seek </p><p>out counterfeit goods. </p><p> </p><p>-- Sharjah Economic Department forced 14 outlets to </p><p>remove the word "Mercedes" and the trademark three </p><p>pointed star in a circle logo associated with the </p><p>Mercedes brand. Sharjah police closed some of the outlets </p><p>pending their compliance. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Ensuring IPR Protection For The Long-Term </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) The UAE Government is examining ways to further </p><p>reduce the flow of counterfeit products and trademark </p><p>infringement in the country.  To this end, the National </p><p>Anti-Fraud Committee was established in 2001 under the </p><p>aegis of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce.  The </p><p>Committee\'s scope of responsibility was broadened in 2002 </p><p>to allow for the study of commercial fraud and </p><p>counterfeit and imitation trademarks, and requires that </p><p>the Committee propose combating measures on an annual </p><p>basis. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) The Emirate of Dubai established the "Dubai </p><p>Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone </p><p>(TECOM)," which contains Dubai Internet City and Dubai </p><p>Media City, and has been at the forefront of protecting </p><p>digital media. In February 2002, Dubai issued the </p><p>"Electronic Transactions and Commerce Law," which is </p><p>modeled on the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce </p><p>adopted by the United Nations.  A similar federal law is </p><p>under consideration by the UAE Ministry of Justice that </p><p>would address copyright violations on the Internet, in </p><p>particular. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) In October 2002, Sharjah sponsored a conference </p><p>to encourage dialogue between IPR experts and the local </p><p>business community regarding the value of intellectual </p><p>property assets and how they can be tools for economic </p><p>growth.  IPR experts also discussed how local businesses </p><p>could utilize patent laws to develop new business and </p><p>import/export technology through licensing.  Not to be </p><p>outdone, Dubai will host a conference on "Middle East Law </p><p>in the Internet Age" in March 2003. Designed for </p><p>intellectual property and technology lawyers, the </p><p>conference will explore recent legal developments in the </p><p>area of electronic transactions, intellectual property </p><p>and the Internet. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
