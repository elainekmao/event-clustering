<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002738 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WORLD AIDS DAY; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "The AIDS pandemic in Southern Africa" </p><p>      the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its </p><p>      December 1 editorial to calling for "political commitment" </p><p>      in the fight against HIV/AIDS, adding that "there should </p><p>      also be financial commitment to allocate enough money to </p><p>      programs of prevention and those that alleviate the </p><p>      suffering of infected persons."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "As the world commemorates World Aids Day today, the </p><p>      latest United Nations report on HIV/AIDS indicates </p><p>      that the epidemic is getting worse in Southern </p><p>      Africa. . .The U. N. report links the devastation of </p><p>      the AIDS pandemic to the current drought and famine </p><p>      in a number of countries in Southern Africa, and </p><p>      predicts more suffering for the region. . .It is </p><p>      estimated that more than 14 million people are now </p><p>      on the brink of starvation in Lesotho, Malawi, </p><p>      Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. . .The </p><p>      HIV/AIDS pandemic is real.  In order for Southern </p><p>      Africa and indeed for Africa as a whole to win the </p><p>      fight against AIDS, there is need for action beyond </p><p>      just awareness campaigns.  There must be political </p><p>      commitment to implement multi-sectoral national </p><p>      strategies to combat the spread of the disease. </p><p>      There should also be financial commitment to </p><p>      allocate enough money to programs of prevention and </p><p>      those that alleviate the suffering of infected </p><p>      persons.  Above all, the fight against HIV/AIDS is </p><p>      not an individual fight, there is need for combined </p><p>      effort.  Just as most African countries have </p><p>      national programs and strategies to deal with the </p><p>      HIV/AIDS pandemic, it is time to think of a SADC </p><p>      regional strategy to fight the disease and, </p><p>      eventually perhaps, an African continental plan to </p><p>      combat HIV/AIDS." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
