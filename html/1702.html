<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001128 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IO/S, IO/T, DHHS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2006 </p><p>TAGS: AORC, PHUM, NI, UNCHR, WHO </p><p>SUBJECT: WHO DEMARCHE/LOSS OF CHR SEAT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 84094 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche on May 14 to Nonye </p><p>C. ("Joel") Udegbunam, Minister Counselor in the Second U.N. </p><p>Division at the MFA.  Udegbunam said that as a member of the </p><p>Fifth Committee, he had personally worked on the negotiating </p><p>the reduction in the UN scales of assessment, and said he </p><p>would be returning to New York to participate in the WHA </p><p>later this week.  He asserted that Nigeria would abide by the </p><p>negotiated agreement, and would not support any attempt to </p><p>change the U.S. portion of the WHO scale of assessment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  In an aside, Udegbunam mentioned that he was </p><p>"shocked" that the U.S. had lost its seat on the CHR. </p><p>However, he implied that the loss came as no surprise to him: </p><p>he claimed that he had expressed concern to G-77 colleagues </p><p>prior/prior to the vote about what the reaction of the U.S. </p><p>Congress might be to losing the seat.  He asked Poloff if the </p><p>USG had been aware that the Europeans had been actively </p><p>working to deny the U.S. re-election.  Poloff replied that he </p><p>had no persnal knowledge of such an endeavor.  Udegbunam </p><p>acknowledged that Nigeria did not vote with the U.S. on every </p><p>issue during the latest CHR session, but asserted that </p><p>Nigeria had voted for the U.S. to keep its seat on the </p><p>Commission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Comment: Udegbunam said he developed his sensitivity </p><p>to U.S. Conressional views as a member of the Fifth </p><p>Committee.  He said he was in New York, and not in Geneva, as </p><p>CHR-related events unfolded.  Embassy has not had much </p><p>interaction with Udegbunam and does not know hoow accurate </p><p>his recollection of conversations and their exact timing </p><p>might be.  He was, however, a more sympathetic interlocutor </p><p>than Christy Mbonu.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
