SUMMARY:  PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH\'S ADDRESS CALLING FOR THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF U.S.-MIDDLE EAST FREE TRADE AREA RECEIVED </p><p>PROMINENT COVERAGE IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL PRINT AND ELECTRONIC </p><p>MEDIA.  ALL UAE DAILIES PUBLISHED LENGTHY EXCERPTS OF THE SPEECH, </p><p>AND ABU DHABI TV, AL JAZEERA, AND AL ARABIYAH BROADCAST THE </p><p>SPEECH LIVE.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL ASSERTED THAT THE </p><p>VERACITY OF PRESIDENT BUSH\'S PLAN FOR A NEW MIDDLE EAST IS </p><p>DOUBTED BY MANY IN THE REGION.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "CARROT AND </p><p>STICK DIPLOMACY," A GULF NEWS EDITORIAL CLAIMED THAT BUSH\'S PLAN </p><p>WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED BY ARABS AND MUSLIMS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S PLAN FOR A NEW MIDDLE EAST, </p><p>SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/11: </p><p> </p><p>"PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH\'S PLAN FOR A NEW MIDDLE EAST AND HIS </p><p>SUGGESTION TO ESTABLISH A U.S.-MIDDLE EAST FREE TRADE AREA BY THE </p><p>YEAR 2013 GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF GOOD WILL AND AMERICAN CONCERN </p><p>FOR THE REGION AND ITS PEOPLE ... BUT WHOEVER LOOKS CAREFULLY AT </p><p>THIS PLAN AND ITS GOALS AND REFERS TO PAST U.S. POLICIES TOWARDS </p><p>THE REGION ... THE PLAN RELIES ON PREVIOUS ISRAELI MINISTER </p><p>SHIMON PEREZ\'S PROPOSAL FOR A NEW MIDDLE EAST.  THE PLAN IN </p><p>THEORY WILL BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN TWO UNEQUAL SIDES, </p><p>ECONOMICALLY AND MILITARILY.  THIS PLAN IS TALKING ABOUT A REGION </p><p>THAT STILL HAS CONFLICTS, MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ARAB-ISRAELI </p><p>CONFLICT, WHICH THE U.S. TREATS WITH TOTAL BIAS FOR ISRAEL AND </p><p>SUPPORTS ITS RACIST AND AGGRESSIVE POLICIES ..." </p><p> </p><p>"DOUBTS ARE INCREASING ABOUT THIS PLAN, SINCE IT COMES AT A TIME </p><p>WHEN SOME ARAB COUNTRIES ARE PRESSURED TO GIVE IN TO THE DEMANDS </p><p>AND CONDITIONS AIMING TO ELIMINATE THE STRENGTH AND RIGHT OF </p><p>REFUSAL OF THESE COUNTRIES, DRIVING THEM TO OBEDIENCE, AND </p><p>DISREGARDING THEIR RIGHTS.  THIS PLAN NOW PUTS THE \'CART BEFORE </p><p>THE HORSE,\' BECAUSE ITS IMPLEMENTATION SUGGESTS FIRST THAT THIS </p><p>REGION SHOULD BE BLESSED WITH SECURITY, STABILITY, AND PEACE ... </p><p>THE U.S. PLAN FOR A NEW MIDDLE EAST COMES AT THE WRONG TIME, </p><p>EXCEPT IF THE U.S. THINKS THAT IT CAN IMPOSE ISRAEL ON THE REGION </p><p>... IF THE U.S. IS SERIOUS ABOUT ESTABLISHING A NEW MIDDLE EAST </p><p>THAT IS ECONOMICALLY PROSPEROUS AND BLESSED WITH THE LIBERTY AND </p><p>DEMOCRACY PRESIDENT BUSH TALKS ABOUT, IT (THE U.S.) SHOULD </p><p>IMMEDIATELY START BY REQUIRING THAT ISRAEL IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DECISIONS IN ORDER TO REACH A JUST, COMPREHENSIVE, </p><p>AND LASTING PEACE ... OR ELSE THESE PLANS WILL ONLY AIM TO </p><p>BEAUTIFY THE U.S.\'S IMAGE IN THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE OF THE </p><p>REGION." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "CARROT AND STICK DIPLOMACY," ENGLISH- </p><p>LANGUAGE EXPATRIATE-ORIENTED "GULF NEWS" EDITORIALIZED 5/11: </p><p> </p><p>"... AMERICAN PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH HAS OUTLINED A MIDEAST </p><p>TRADE PLAN.  THE OBJECTIVE IS TO HAVE MIDDLE EAST NATIONS SIGN UP </p><p>TO A U.S.-BACKED TRADE INITIATIVE, GIVING SUCH NATIONS SPECIAL </p><p>TERMS, PRESUMABLY ON A QUID PRO QUO BASIS. YET, THERE IS MORE TO </p><p>THIS INITIATIVE THAN MERE BUSINESS ... THE UNDERLYING REASON IS </p><p>FOR THE ARAB WORLD TO IMPROVE - OR CHANGE - ITS POLITICAL </p><p>STRUCTURES AND SEE DEMOCRACY IN ARAB NATIONS, TOGETHER WITH </p><p>GREATER HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS." </p><p> </p><p>"WHILST MANY MIDDLE EAST NATIONS MAY WELCOME THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>IMPROVING TRADE WITH THE U.S., EVERY ARAB AND MUSLIM NATION WILL </p><p>OBJECT STRONGLY TO THE METHOD EMPLOYED TO ATTRACT SUCH </p><p>PARTICIPATION. FOR IT REQUIRES FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES NOT ONLY IN </p><p>SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW BUT, FAR MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE VERY </p><p>INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM.  THIS IS BECAUSE ARAB MUSLIM LAW AND </p><p>SOCIETY IS BASED ON THE HOLY QURAN, SO ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THE </p><p>INTERPRETATIONS OF THE HOLY QURAN SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE MADE BY </p><p>AN OUTSIDE POWER - A WESTERN ONE AT THAT - AND DEFINITELY NOT </p><p>COERCED BY THE PROSPECT OF INCREASED TRADE.  THE RELIGION, </p><p>HISTORY AND CULTURE OF THE REGION CAN BE TRACED BACK FARTHER THAN </p><p>THAT OF AMERICA; IT IS THE FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE AMERICAN </p><p>ADMINISTRATIONS TO UNDERSTAND THE THEORY OF SUCH CONCEPTS THAT </p><p>DEPICTS THEIR DESIRE TO IMPOSE THE "AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE" WHERE </p><p>IT IS NOT WANTED." </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
