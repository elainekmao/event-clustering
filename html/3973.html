Under headline "American war drums discord" the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Sunday Mirror" used its </p><p>      October 13 editorial to argue against an U.S. attack </p><p>      on Iraq.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "As President George W. Bush presses ahead with </p><p>      his plans to attack Iraq, there are more voices </p><p>      opposing the war plan. . .   But, even as the U.S. </p><p>      Congress was passing the war vote, there are important </p><p>      dissenting voices to the war plan.  Indeed there are </p><p>      some in the American Congress and House of </p><p>      Representatives who believe that President Bush has </p><p>      not proved that Iraq poses an imminent threat to the </p><p>      USA.  Even American intelligence officials have </p><p>      confirmed that Iraq does not possess any means in the </p><p>      form of missiles capable of reaching the USA.  Iraq is </p><p>      known to possess only short-range missiles capable of </p><p>      reaching neighboring countries, but none of these are </p><p>      capable of carrying nuclear weapons.  But George Bush </p><p>      has insisted that `Saddam Hussein and his outlaw </p><p>      regime pose a grave threat to the region, the world, </p><p>      and the U.S.  Inaction is not an option, disarmament </p><p>      is a must.\'  This has widely been seen as an American </p><p>      excuse to topple Saddam Hussein, which, it seems, </p><p>      President George W. Bush is determined to do. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Another important voice against the </p><p>      planned `Bush war\' is that of the former U.S. </p><p>      President Jimmy Carter who on Friday won this </p><p>      year\'s Nobel Peace Prize.  Carter has been very </p><p>      critical of the Bush administration\'s drive to </p><p>      wage war on Iraq without UN support, warning </p><p>      that this would be `a tragic and costly error.\' </p><p>      The Chairman of the Nobel Committee, Gunnar </p><p>      Berge, is reported to have said, `With the </p><p>      position Carter has taken, the award can and </p><p>      must also be seen as criticism of the line the </p><p>      current U.S. Administration has taken on Iraq.\' </p><p>      Also important, a coalition of Church leaders of </p><p>      more than 60 Christian organizations has </p><p>      condemned the American and British plan to </p><p>      attack Iraq.  The Church leaders argue that the </p><p>      threat posed by Saddam Hussein, though real, is </p><p>      not imminent enough to justify military action. </p><p>      The Episcopal bishop of Washington, John B. </p><p>      Shane, summed up the Church leaders\' feelings </p><p>      and indeed that of many of us when he said: </p><p>      `. . .In this case. . .I don\'t see the threat </p><p>      from Iraq to the U.S. as an imminent threat, so. </p><p>      . .military action against Iraq is </p><p>      inappropriate.\'" </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
