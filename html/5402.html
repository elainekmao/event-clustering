<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000172 </p><p> </p><p>MANILA FOR USADB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, PTER, PGOV, CE </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA: THE LTTE BUILDS A FINANCIAL </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 COLOMBO 996 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  DUE TO AN INTERNATIONAL CRACKDOWN ON </p><p>TERRORIST FINANCING POST SEPTEMBER 11, THE LIBERATION </p><p>TIGERS OF TAMIL EALAM (LTTE) HAS SHIFTED OVER THE PAST YEAR </p><p>FROM FOREIGN FUND-RAISING TO LARGELY DOMESTIC FINANCING. </p><p>WHILE THE LTTE TRADITIONALLY LEVIED TAXES IN AREAS UNDER </p><p>ITS CONTROL, RECENTLY IT HAS DEVISED NEW AND MORE </p><p>SOPHISTICATED MEANS OF RAISING REVENUE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>RECENT MEDIA REPORTS, THE FINANCE DIVISION OF THE LTTE IS </p><p>ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ARMS OF THE REBEL GROUP.  THE TWO </p><p>KEY INSTITUTIONS OF THE LTTE FINANCE ARM ARE "EELAM </p><p>CUSTOMS" AND THE "TAMIL EELAM BANK," BOTH OF WHICH OPERATE </p><p>IN LTTE HELD AREAS IN THE NORTH.  THE LTTE\'S DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>A DISTINCT FINANCIAL SYSTEM WITHIN THE BORDERS OF SRI LANKA </p><p>OFFERS AN INDICATION OF THE DEGREE OF AUTONOMY THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION WOULD LIKELY EXPECT IN ANY FEDERAL SOLUTION TO </p><p>THE ISLAND\'S ETHNIC CONFLICT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>FUND-RAISING SHIFTS INWARD </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. IN THE YEARS SINCE LARGE-SCALE ETHNIC CONFLICT BROKE OUT </p><p>IN 1983, THE LTTE HAS FINANCED ITSELF MOSTLY THROUGH FUND- </p><p>RAISING ABROAD.  SYMPATHETIC MEMBERS OF THE TAMIL DIASPORA </p><p>- PARTICULARLY IN CANADA, THE UK AND AUSTRALIA - DONATED TO </p><p>THE CAUSE OF A SEPARATE TAMIL HOMELAND.  SINCE SEPTEMBER </p><p>11, 2001 THE LTTE HAS FOUND IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO </p><p>RAISE MONEY ABROAD.  AS A DESIGNATED FOREIGN TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION (FTO), THE LTTE HAS SEEN ITS FUNDING DRY UP </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY AMIDST THE US-LED INTERNATIONAL CRACKDOWN ON </p><p>TERRORIST FINANCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AS FOREIGN FUNDS HAVE EVAPORATED, THE LTTE HAS LOOKED </p><p>FOR WAYS TO RAISE MONEY AT HOME.  WHILE THE LTTE HAS LONG </p><p>LEVIED TAXES IN AREAS UNDER ITS CONTROL, IT IS NOW BUILDING </p><p>A SOPHISTICATED FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS IT TO </p><p>COLLECT REVENUE AND REGULATE COMMERCE ON A LARGE SCALE. </p><p>WHILE THE LEVEL OF TAXATION IS AN ADDED BURDEN ON THE LONG- </p><p>SUFFERING RESIDENTS OF SRI LANKA\'S NORTH AND EAST (SEE </p><p>REFTEL), THE LTTE DEFENDS ITS ACTIVITIES SAYING FUNDS ARE </p><p>NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THE ORGANIZATION AND ITS CADRES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE WAR WOUNDED. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>EELAM CUSTOMS: THE LTTE\'S CASH COW </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO REPORTS AND SOURCES IN JAFFNA, THE LTTE\'S </p><p>TAX ARM IS REACHING INTO ALMOST EVERY FACET OF LIFE IN THE </p><p>NORTH, WITH THE MAIN SOURCE OF FUNDS COMING FROM THE LTTE </p><p>CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT.  THE LTTE CUSTOMS OFFICE IS LOCATED IN </p><p>OMANTHAI ALONG THE A-9 ROAD, WHICH LINKS JAFFNA TO THE </p><p>SOUTH.  ALL COMMERCIAL SHIPMENTS ENTERING THE NORTHERN </p><p>PROVINCE ARE UNLOADED, CHECKED AND TAXED AT THIS POINT. </p><p>THE LTE OPERATES A MULTI-BAND TAX STRUCTURE BETWEEN 5% AN </p><p>25%.  FOOD ITEMS ARE GENERALLY TAXED AT 7%, CONUMER ITEMS </p><p>AT 10%, CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL AT 15% ND NON-ESSENTIALS </p><p>BETWEEN 20-25%.  THERE IS A TAX OF 10% ON MOTOR VEHICLES </p><p>TAKEN TO THE NORTHERN PROVINCE FOR PERMANENT USE.  MEDICINE </p><p>IS DUTY FREE.  THE TAX SYSTEM WAS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED IN </p><p>JUNE 2002 IN "SUDAROLI," A PRO-LTTE, TAMIL LANGUAGE DAILY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN ADDITION TO THE TAX ON GOODS, TRUCKS ARE CHARGED RS </p><p>2,500 (APPROX $25) PER TRIP.  EVEN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, </p><p>SUCH AS THE COOPERATIVE WHOLESALE ESTABLISHMENT (CWE) WHICH </p><p>OPERATES A RETAIL STORE IN JAFFNA, PAY THE LTTE TAXES WHEN </p><p>TRANSPORTING GOODS BY ROAD.  GOODS TRANSPORTED FOR OFFICIAL </p><p>USE SUCH AS TO GOVERNMENT BANKS, UNIVERSITIES AND DONOR- </p><p>FUNDED PROJECTS ARE EXEMPTED.  ARTICLES MEANT FOR PERSONAL </p><p>USE ARE NOT TAXED EXCEPT FOR SOME ELECTRICAL ITEMS AND </p><p>LIQUOR.  FURTHER, TRAVELERS TO THE NORTHERN PENINSULA ARE </p><p>TAXED RS 350 ($3.50) PER PERSON.  EXPATRIATE TAMILS </p><p>TRAVELING TO JAFFNA THROUGH OMANTHAI ARE SUPPOSEDLY CHARGED </p><p>RS 500 ($5) PER FAMILY.  GSL EMPLOYEES TRAVELING FOR </p><p>OFFICIAL WORK ARE SPARED THE TAX. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN ADDITION TO THESE CUSTOMS LEVIES AT OMANTHAI, THE </p><p>LTTE IS TAXING COMMERCE IN SEVERAL OTHER WAYS.  FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, TRADERS HAVE TO PAY THE LTTE A FIXED FEE, USUALLY </p><p>EVERY SIX MONTHS.  GSL EMPLOYEES IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE </p><p>PAY A 7% INCOME TAX.  A SOURCE AT A CONSTRUCTION FIRM </p><p>OPERATING IN JAFFNA CONFIRMED THAT THE COMPANY PAYS A TAX </p><p>OF 5% OF CONTRACT VALUE TO THE LTTE.  GUESTHOUSES AND </p><p>INDIVIDUALS RENTING OUT ROOMS ARE ALSO TAXED.  FURTHERMORE, </p><p>THE LTTE OCCASIONALLY CONDUCTS SPECIAL CAMPAIGNS AND </p><p>RALLIES TO COLLECT MONEY FROM TRADERS, BUSINESSMEN AND </p><p>WORKERS.  WHEN THE LTTE TAX COLLECTOR KNOCKS ON YOUR DOOR </p><p>FOR A "SPECIAL CAMPAIGN," THE SENSIBLE CITIZEN READILY PAYS </p><p>UP. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>BANK OF TAMIL EELAM: SRI LANKA\'S OTHER STATE BANK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE LTTE ALSO OPERATES A BANKING NETWORK UNDER THE NAME </p><p>BANK OF TAMIL EELAM (BOTE).  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS AND </p><p>SOURCES IN JAFFNA, THE BANK HAS FIVE BRANCHES IN LTTE </p><p>CONTROLLED AREAS, ALTHOUGH IT HAS NO LICENSE FROM THE </p><p>CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA, WHICH IS THE SOLE MONETARY </p><p>AUTHORITY IN SRI LANKA.  BOTE WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED ABOUT </p><p>10 YEARS AGO WHEN THE GSL IMPOSED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON </p><p>LTTE CONTROLLED AREAS.  IN THE LTTE ADMINISTRATIVE CAPITAL </p><p>KILINOCHCHI, THE BOTE IS SITUATED JUST OPPOSITE THE </p><p>BRANCHES OF TWO GSL STATE OWNED BANKS, BANK OF CEYLON AND </p><p>PEOPLE\'S BANK.  THE BOTE BRANCH IN KILINOCHCHI HAS OVER </p><p>10,000 ACCOUNT HOLDERS, MOSTLY RETURNING REFUGEES. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS, THE LTTE ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO </p><p>BANK WITH THE BOTE, AND MUCH OF THE BOTE BALANCE SHEET </p><p>CONSISTS OF LTTE DEPOSITS (PROCEEDS FROM TAX COLLECTION). </p><p>BOTE\'S SUCCESS IN ATTRACTING DEPOSITS IS ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO </p><p>HIGHER INTEREST RATES, A VARIETY OF CREDIT FACILITIES AND </p><p>CONVENIENCE.  FOR INSTANCE, THE BANK IS OPEN EVEN ON PUBLIC </p><p>HOLIDAYS WHEN OTHER BANKS ARE CLOSED.  IN SPITE OF </p><p>FUNCTIONING WITHOUT GOVERNMENT APPROVAL, THE BANK OFFERS </p><p>MANY CONVENTIONAL BANKING FACILITIES SUCH AS FIXED </p><p>DEPOSITS, CURRENT ACCOUNTS, SAVING ACCOUNTS AND FOREIGN </p><p>EXCHANGE SERVICES.  IT ALSO OFFERS PAWNING FACILITIES, AND </p><p>LOANS FOR HOUSING AND BUSINESS.  AS IN ANY OTHER BANK, IT </p><p>ISSUES CHEQUE BOOKS AND MONTHLY STATEMENTS TO CUSTOMERS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  PRESIDENT CHANDRIKA KUMRANATUNGA RAISED THE ISSUE OF </p><p>LTTE TAXES IN SEPTEMBER 2002 AFTER THE JAFFNA MUNICIPAL </p><p>COUNCIL AND SEVERAL OTHER LOCAL BODIES IN THE NORTH PASSED </p><p>RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING THE ILLEGAL TAXES.  A GROUP OF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE ALSO RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE ILLEGAL </p><p>OPERATION OF THE BOTE.  THE GSL HAS NOT SO FAR INTERFERED </p><p>WITH THE ILLEGAL BANKING OPERATIONS, CLAIMING IT DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF THEIR EXISTENCE.  THE DIRECTOR OF </p><p>BANK SUPERVISION OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA TOLD THE </p><p>EMBASSY THAT THE CENTRAL BANK HAS NOT INVESTIGATED </p><p>OPERATIONS OF THE BOTE IN LTTE CONTROLLED AREAS.  POLICE </p><p>SOURCES HAVE SAID THAT BOTE IS NOT FUNCTIONING IN AREAS </p><p>UNDER GSL CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE LTTE APPEARS TO BE METHODICALLY DEVELOPING A </p><p>PARALLEL FINANCIAL SYSTEM WITHIN SRI LANKA\'S BORDERS. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THE LTTE IS BUILDING A HEAVILY REGULATED, </p><p>HEAVILY TAXED AND LARGELY CLOSED ECONOMY.  THE OFFICIAL SRI </p><p>LANKAN ECONOMY, BY CONTRAST, IS TRADE-BASED AND BY FAR THE </p><p>MOST OPEN IN SOUTH ASIA.  THESE DIVERGENT FINANCIAL SYSTEMS </p><p>THREATEN TO INCREASE THE ALREADY ALARMING DISPARITY IN </p><p>STANDARDS OF LIVING IN COLOMBO VS. THE NORTH/EAST - A </p><p>WORRYING PROSPECT FOR THE FUTURE OF THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  MOREOVER, THE LTTE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF BEING WILLING TO </p><p>DISMANTLE THE FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IT IS DEVELOPING. </p><p>THE LTTE\'S HOMEGROWN ECONOMIC POLICY - COMPLETE WITH </p><p>CUSTOMS DUTIES TO ENTER "EELAM" TO A "STATE"-RUN BANK - </p><p>SHOWS THE DEGREE OF REGIONAL AUTONOMY IT LIKELY ENVISAGES </p><p>AS PART OF ANY FEDERAL SOLUTION TO THE ETHNIC CONFLICT.  IT </p><p>IS A VISION OF REGIONAL AUTONOMY THAT MAY BE FAR DIFFERENT </p><p>FROM THAT OF GSL - A YAWNING GAP THAT ILLUSTRATES THE </p><p>CHALLENGES AHEAD IN THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
