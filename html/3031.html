SUMMARY: THIS CABLE UPDATES ON PREPARATIONS FOR THE </p><p>JUNE 10-13 WORLD FOOD SUMMIT FIVE YEARS LATER (WFS5YL) </p><p>MEETING IN ROME, JUNE 10-13, 2002. SOME 50 HEADS OF </p><p>STATE/HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ARE EXPECTED, MOSTLY FROM </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  ITALY, SPAIN, BELGIUM AND SWEDEN </p><p>ARE THE ONLY OECD HEADS OF STATE/GOVERNMENT ATTENDING. </p><p>THE FAO IS STILL DEVELOPING IDEAS FOR SIDE EVENTS TO </p><p>COMPLEMENT PLENARY STATEMENTS, ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS AND </p><p>A CIVIL SOCIETY/GOVERNMENTS MULTISTAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE. </p><p>MOST OECD DONORS ARE PRIVATELY UNENTHUSIASTIC, HOWEVER, </p><p>ABOUT A RECENTLY-ANNOUNCED FAO EVENT WHICH IS BILLED AS </p><p>AN OPPORTUNITY TO MATCH PROJECTS WITH FUNDING.  SOME 600 </p><p>NGOS ARE ALREADY OFFICIALLY "ACCREDITED" TO THE CITY OF </p><p>ROME-SPONSORED "NGO FORUM" IN NEARBY EUR.  TWO INFORMAL </p><p>MEETINGS ON THE DRAFT WFS5YL DECLARATION HAVE CLARIFIED </p><p>SOME PROCEDURAL ISSUES, AND SURFACED SOME ISSUES OF </p><p>CONCERN TO COUNTRIES (BUT HAVE ALSO SEEN SOME FRICTION </p><p>DUE TO  UNREALISTIC G-77 EXPECTATIONS THAT THE OECD (AND </p><p>THE EU, IN PARTICULAR) WOULD BE READY TO NEGOTIATE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>WHO\'S COMING </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE LATEST (UNOFFICIAL)COUNT IS 40 HEADS OF STATE AND </p><p>10 HEADS OF GOVERNMENT.
