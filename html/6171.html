<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001459 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 6 COB: RETURN OF COMPLACENCY </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Never Never Land in Our Markets" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On March 6, Turkish financial markets were stable. </p><p>The lira remained unchanged at TL 1, 608,000 to the dollar. </p><p>Yields on lira-denominated T-bills strengthened slightly to </p><p>57.5 percent compounded (yesterday\'s close was 58 percent). </p><p>The Istanbul Stock Exchange closed up 0.2 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Lehman Bros Turkey analyst Tolga Ediz told us </p><p>Turkish markets are living in "never never land" where all </p><p>hopes rest with the U.S. financial package coming true.  Ediz </p><p>added that "as long as U.S. ships are anchored off the </p><p>Turkish coast," market participants will continue to believe. </p><p> Further confirmation comes from Turkish press reports of </p><p>ongoing site prep work.  Some foreign funds are getting back </p><p>into Turkish markets on the prospect of the U.S. package, he </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: After reaching quick agreement with IMF </p><p>staff on the budget overnight March 2, a mood of complacency </p><p>seems to have returned to the GOT, and is settling on the </p><p>markets as well.  IMF staff in Ankara report no further </p><p>progress on finalizing the draft LOI (more IMF readout March </p><p>7).  All this leaves open the prospect of Turkey entering </p><p>next week with no agreement on the IMF Fourth Review, and no </p><p>actual progress towards a U.S. package.  Bender Securities </p><p>analyst Murat Golkan volunteered to us March 6 that this </p><p>prospect concerns him, though he said he appears to be a lone </p><p>voice.  Asked about possible market reaction to such a worst </p><p>case scenario, Golkan said "meltdown."  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile World Bank Prepares to Cancel </p><p>Pending Loans </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The World Bank\'s Country Director for Turkey Ajay </p><p>Chhibber told us March 6 that the World Bank is moving to </p><p>cancel $1.375 billion in pending loans that are due to expire </p><p>on March 31.  The reason is World Bank unhappiness with the </p><p>2003 budget, which postpones the "Direct Income Support" </p><p>payments to farmers (TL 1.4 quadrillion) into 2004.  Chhibber </p><p>said he had instructions from headquarters to publicly come </p><p>out against the budget, but he is holding off.  He told </p><p>MinState Babacan this week that unless the GOT put back in </p><p>the 2003 budget at least TL 1 quadrillion (about $600 </p><p>million), then the pending loans would be canceled.  Babacan </p><p>said he would come back to Chhibber. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The World Bank\'s assessment, per Chhibber, is that </p><p>this government is highly unlikely to do any significant </p><p>reforms in 2003.   The Bank will seek to limit further </p><p>exposure to Turkey this year (both its $1.375 billion in </p><p>direct budget loan programs and some of its $600 million in </p><p>project financing), and "keep powder dry" for 2004.  "They </p><p>would waste the money anyway," he concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Comment:  The World Bank theoretically has a high </p><p>loan limit for Turkey ($5 billion over three years under its </p><p>"high case" scenario, which it is now downgrading), but in </p><p>fact the Bank only disbursed a total of $680 million to </p><p>Turkey in 2002, and about $1 billion in 2001.  So downgrading </p><p>its presence in Turkey would not have an immediate, large </p><p>effect on budget financing.  The bigger impact of such a move </p><p>would be on market confidence, and then only if the Bank </p><p>publicized its discontent. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
