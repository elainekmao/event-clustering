The start of the June 1 food distribution was delayed </p><p>one day in Babil because food agents needed to replace old </p><p>food-recipient lists with updated ones that included newly </p><p>registered people, such as newborns and returning Babil </p><p>residents.   The DART participated in the daily Governorate </p><p>Support Team meeting in Al Hillah, providing updates on the </p><p>food distribution and DART partner activities in Al Hillah. </p><p>The DART returned to Al Hillah pediatric hospital and found </p><p>some conditions improved.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>BABIL FOOD DISTRIBUTION DELAYED ONE DAY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The June public distribution system (PDS) began in Al </p><p>Hillah with food agents obtaining the new registration lists </p><p>for their beneficiaries from the Ministry of Trade (MOT) re- </p><p>registration center.  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) </p><p>staff confirmed that the lists were ready and that the </p><p>agents would begin ration pick-up at the main warehouse on 2 </p><p>June.  WFP international sub-office staff briefed Coalition </p><p>operations officers on security procedures at the warehouse </p><p>on 1 June. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART visited the cold warehouse facility that </p><p>currently stores sugar and tea commodities, and noticed </p><p>possible unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination at the </p><p>facility.  The DART will request from the Civil Military </p><p>Operations Center (CMOC) in Al Hillah that a UXO sweep the </p><p>area. This cold-store facility is not involved in the </p><p>current distribution. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART met with two members of the Salvation Army (SA) </p><p>to discuss the SA/WFP memorandum of agreement and the </p><p>present WFP plans for the June distribution. SA said it had </p><p>been assigned to Al Hillah to assist WFP in monitoring on- </p><p>going distributions. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>DEMONSTRATION AT AL HILLAH CITY HALL </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  "With our souls, we will sacrifice to protect our </p><p>country," chanted 200 to 250 former Iraqi soldiers and </p><p>others outside Al Hillah\'s City Hall where the CMOC is </p><p>based, angry over their loss of jobs and lack of salaries. </p><p>Some had also expressed anger over newly distributed CMOC </p><p>weapons-collections fliers by tearing them up and throwing </p><p>them in the air. </p><p> </p><p>6.  A Civil Affairs officer of the Governorate Support Team </p><p>(GST) announced a draft proposal to create an Al Hillah </p><p>"conservation corps," employing 200 people for such projects </p><p>as painting public buildings, installing trash cans in </p><p>Babil, planting trees along highways, and building </p><p>playgrounds and public benches.  It would be a branch of the </p><p>municipal public works department.  Any citizen could </p><p>nominate a public-works project for the corps through the </p><p>city council.  There are no funds currently earmarked for </p><p>the corps, and there is doubt whether it could be </p><p>sustainable.  It also requires the governor\'s approval. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The GST health officer said the Ministry of Health (MOH) </p><p>drug distribution center of Babil was sending three trucks </p><p>to MOH-Baghdad tomorrow to pick up medical equipment and </p><p>supplies.  The manager of the Babil pharmacy department, </p><p>confirmed the plan.  She also announced that the Coalition </p><p>forces based in Al Hillah had donated to the Babil MOH some </p><p>excess medical supplies. </p><p> </p><p>8.  A Civil Affairs officer reported there was no news of re- </p><p>supplies of benzene, and added that liquid petroleum gas </p><p>(LPG) "was another nightmare."  Coalition forces faced </p><p>hostile crowds that threw stones at them yesterday at a </p><p>Babil LPG distribution center because of anger over LPG </p><p>shortages and an unorganized local distribution process.  At </p><p>least for the short-term, the Coalition forces will control </p><p>the individual sale of LPG at this distribution center. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>AL HILLAH PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Since the DART last visited the Babylon Maternity and </p><p>Children\'s Hospital in Al Hillah on 15 May, the security, </p><p>drug supply, electricity, and staff productivity have </p><p>improved.   However, salaries remain unpaid, and there are </p><p>shortages of oxygen and certain essential drugs, according </p><p>to the hospital\'s director.  He also said the hospital\'s air- </p><p>conditioning system was failing and that three of four </p><p>elevators were out of service.  A drug shipment arrived at </p><p>the MOH drug warehouse in Babil last week from MOH in </p><p>Baghdad, providing some relief to the hospital that now has </p><p>sufficient stock of most drugs for June. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Certain drugs remain short, including Pentostam, a drug </p><p>for "Black Fever" disease.  The director said 42 vials </p><p>arrived last week, but 200 would be needed to cover the </p><p>hospital\'s need for this year.  A lack of Pentostam is </p><p>chronic.  "I think a large number (died this year) because </p><p>of shortage," he said. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Security has improved at the hospital even though the </p><p>director\'s request for a Coalition security presence was </p><p>denied.  He is pleased about reports that the hospital self- </p><p>financing system will gradually disappear.  He thought a fee- </p><p>for-service system was especially hard on the poor. </p><p>Electricity was bad through last week, the director said, </p><p>but has improved each day.  The hospital\'s two generators </p><p>are working well. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Over 60 percent of children arriving at the hospital </p><p>suffer from gastrointestinal problems, the director said. </p><p>In the last month, the director said there had been only one </p><p>to two suspected cholera cases.  Last year, the director </p><p>said there had been a cholera "epidemic."  About 60 to 70 </p><p>percent of the female adult patients are anemic, according </p><p>to a female doctor of gynecology at the hospital who said </p><p>anemia had increased dramatically under 12 years of </p><p>international sanctions on Iraq.  Prior to the Gulf War in </p><p>1991, she said she had treated relatively few anemic women </p><p>in a health clinic where she worked. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The hospital normally requires 30 to 40 bottles of </p><p>oxygen per day; today it makes due with 10 to 15.  Some </p><p>relief is expected from the international "Red Cross" that </p><p>promised the hospital 80 bottles of oxygen.  A truck was </p><p>sent to Baghdad today to pick them up.  Oxygen is currently </p><p>rationed in surgical procedures, used only at the beginning </p><p>and end of operations.  Minor surgery uses no oxygen.  As a </p><p>result, only one of four surgical theaters is open.  "All </p><p>the patients are standing there (waiting)," the female </p><p>doctor said, "one after the other" to undergo surgery.   The </p><p>premature baby\'s ward had several incubators, all working </p><p>well.  The hospital\'s director said they were only five </p><p>years old.  "That\'s very new for us," he said. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
