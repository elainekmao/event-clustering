<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 18:  MARKETS TURN AROUND ON </p><p>RENEWED HOPES FOR U.S. PACKAGE </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Rebound on "Good News" from Washington </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The Turkish Treasury raised TL 3.4 quadrillion (about </p><p>$ 2 billion) in two lira-denominated debt instrument auctions </p><p>on March 18, as Turkish markets rebounded on overnight "good </p><p>news" regarding the U.S. financial package (see para 3 </p><p>below).  The auction results announced 1:30 pm local time </p><p>were: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Debt instrument   Yield   Amt Raised </p><p>---------------   ------  ---------- </p><p>One-year bond    60.0 pct  TL 2.6 quad </p><p>4.5 month bill   55.5 pct  TL 0.8 quad </p><p>(yields are in annually compounded terms) </p><p>2.  (U)  In secondary markets, T-bill rates likewise came </p><p>down to 60 percent compounded, the level of Friday\'s close. </p><p>The lira returned to TL 1,648,000 (Friday\'s close, prior to </p><p>yesterday\'s five percent depreciation) and the Istanbul Stock </p><p>Exchange rebounded 10 percent in morning trading, erasing </p><p>nearly all of yesterday\'s losses.  JP Morgan/Chase Treasurer </p><p>told us yesterday\'s spikes were "over for now, based on the </p><p>good news of the U.S financial package." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Press Statements Behind </p><p>Positive Market Sentiment </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Turkish print and TV media reports of the Secretary\'s </p><p>March 17 telephone call with Deputy PM and FM Gul interpreted </p><p>Powell as giving Turkey 72 hours starting from March 17 </p><p>evening to pass a parliamentary resolution for U.S. troop </p><p>deployments.  According to these reports, if Turkey passes a </p><p>second troop resolution within 72 hours, then the U.S. will </p><p>seek the full economic package from Congress (Note: a variant </p><p>of the interpretation, published in the daily Milliyet, says </p><p>a resolution covering only air overflight  clearances would </p><p>result in a smaller financial package.) </p><p>--  According to March 18 edition of Hurriyet, the largest </p><p>circulation Turkish daily, "Ankara moved after the USA and </p><p>Great Britain\'s message that \'you have 72 hours to pass the </p><p>parliamentary resolution.\'  After the Powell phone call, a </p><p>war summit was called at the Cankaya (presidential) </p><p>palace....British Ambassador Westacott later gave the PM a </p><p>message from PM Blair that \'if you pass the resolution in 72 </p><p>hours, it will be good.\'" (Hurriyet and the daily Milliyet </p><p>also separately reported that Powell told Gul of a 72 hour </p><p>deadline for IRAQ, but the "72-hour message to Turkey" was </p><p>what caught the markets\' attention.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Turkish market analysts headlined this "message" in their </p><p>morning March 18 reports.  For example, Bender Securities, </p><p>the top stock brokerage house for foreign investors, wrote </p><p>March 18:  "The U.S. gave Turkey a 72-hour deadline yesterday </p><p>to pass a second troop motion.   According to Powell, all </p><p>agreements would be kept intact, including the $6 billion </p><p>loan package, if Turkey were to give approval." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Following the late March 17 summit meeting at the </p><p>Presidential palace (which included PM Erdogan, FM Gul and </p><p>CHOD Ozkok), Presidential spokesman Tacan Ildem gave a press </p><p>statement that alluded to the possibility of a second </p><p>parliamentary resolution:  "A full consensus was reached that </p><p>the government should take all measures to protect national </p><p>interests of Turkey against all these  developments, and take </p><p>steps immediately in line with its assessments under the </p><p>recommendation of the National Security Council meeting of </p><p>January 31."  (Comment: Market participants such as JP </p><p>Morgan/Chase Treasurer Gumisdis relied on this statement, </p><p>telling us that statements from the President and military </p><p>carry more credibility than those from AKP sources.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) State Minister Babacan gave two telephone interviews </p><p>to Turkish TV news stations, reported at mid-morning March </p><p>18, that confirmed to market participants that the full U.S. </p><p>financial package was on the table.  Babacan said: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "The previous financial agreements with the U.S. are </p><p>still valid.  The details of these agreements have been </p><p>announced previously." </p><p>--  "We agreed with the U.S. that the bridge loan will be </p><p>released once President Bush goes to the Congress." </p><p>--  "The pre-conditions for the U.S. 8.5 billion bridge loan </p><p>are the inclusion of a 6.5 percent primary surplus target in </p><p>the budget, and signing of the Letter of Intent with the </p><p>IMF." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Reuters, both Turkish and English-language, carried a </p><p>statement from U.S. Treasury spokesman Tony Fratto that some </p><p>read as confirming the Turkish interpretation of a full U.S. </p><p>package on the table.  Per Reuters, Fratto said:  "No doors </p><p>have been closed, but the President and the Secretary have </p><p>made clear that we\'re proceeding." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Status of IMF LOI:  "No Sense of Urgency" </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) On March 18 am, IMF resrep told us, after he spoke </p><p>with Treasury U/S Oztrak, that he "sensed no urgency in the </p><p>GOT to complete the LOI."  He listed three substantive </p><p>issues, bracketed by the Turks, that must be resolved before </p><p>the LOI can be signed: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Transfer of supervision of non-bank financial </p><p>institutions from Treasury to the Banking Regulatory and </p><p>Supervision Agency, set in the LOI for July (last bullet of </p><p>para 31 in LOI).  Treasury is challenging this transfer for </p><p>its own bureaucratic reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Halting the existing investigations (by Prime Ministry </p><p>and other GOT inspection agencies) into the BRSA\'s </p><p>intervention of Pamukbank (last bullet of para 27). The GOT </p><p>doesn\'t want these "sensitive" investigations included in the </p><p>LOI, but the IMF insists that they be halted before the LOI </p><p>can be signed.  The compromise, per IMF resrep, is for the </p><p>GOT to obviate the need to include this informal prior action </p><p>in the LOI by halting the investigations now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On the GOT\'s existing anti-corruption plan, the new </p><p>government must assign some agency to follow-up on the </p><p>earlier recommendations (para 44).  The AKP governments have </p><p>not yet decided whether to adopt the pre-exisitng </p><p>anti-corruption plan, and thus haven\'t not made the decision </p><p>to follow the plan\'s recommendations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Resrep noted a fourth "technical housekeeping" issue </p><p>which is still not completed:  setting the intermediate </p><p>fiscal targets for 2003 (e.g., bi-monthly primary surplus </p><p>targets to reach the year-end 6.5 percent of GNP.)  The </p><p>monetary aggregates have been agreed, he noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) IMF resrep said in theory the GOT could wrap up </p><p>these remaining issues under the LOI this week, but he </p><p>reiterated that he sees no sense of urgency in the GOT from </p><p>his talks with Oztrak. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Once they sign the LOI, the Turks must complete four </p><p>prior actions before the IMF staff can take the Fourth Review </p><p>to its board. The four priors are:  full parliamentary </p><p>passage of the budget; passage through parliamentary </p><p>committee of the direct tax reform bill; adoption of the </p><p>TEKEL privatization plan by the High Privatization Council; </p><p>and adoption of regulatory measures to address redundant </p><p>positions in the state economic enterprises. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
