<p>S E C R E T ABU DHABI 001766 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA AND PRM/ANE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/9/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PREF, GCC, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  SECRETARY\'S ORAL MESSAGE TO GCC FM\'S </p><p>DELIVERED TO MFA MINSTATE HAMDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  State 95252 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The Ambassador delivered reftel oral message </p><p>to MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan on </p><p>4/13.  Hamdan said his attendance at the 4/15 GCC </p><p>Foreign Ministerial depended on the timing of a </p><p>visit the same day to Abu Dhabi by Russian Deputy </p><p>Foreign Minister Saltanov to discuss Iraq and other </p><p>regional issues.  Hamdan expected that the GCC </p><p>Foreign Ministers would discuss how the Arab/Gulf </p><p>media should respond to the new political situation </p><p>in Iraq.  He also noted that the agenda would </p><p>include the humanitarian situation in Iraq and the </p><p>need for a regional plan of action. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) The Ambassador asked that the UAE keep in </p><p>mind Iraq\'s immediate energy needs and suggested </p><p>assistance to support basic human needs.  Hamdan </p><p>said the Red Crescent Authority (RCA) is focused on </p><p>food and medicine, but would keep it in mind as they </p><p>assess Iraqi needs.  Hamdan said the RCA\'s </p><p>humanitarian shipment, delivered to Umm Qasr on </p><p>4/11, was being distributed and that Emirati doctors </p><p>traveling with the RCA team had treated Iraqi </p><p>patients in the south.  He said the next step was to </p><p>get supplies and equipment into Baghdad, especially </p><p>in light of the dire situation in the looted </p><p>hospitals.  The Ambassador noted that the Embassy </p><p>was coordinating with the RCA on the possibility of </p><p>sending a humanitarian shipment via air into Baghdad </p><p>International.  Hamdan offered that UAE Air Force C- </p><p>130\'s -- which have been used to ferry humanitarian </p><p>supplies to Afghanistan -- could fly into Baghdad. </p><p>The Ambassador said she would look into this </p><p>possibility, noting that, given the continuing </p><p>security problems at the airport and in Baghdad in </p><p>general, only coalition military aircraft equipped </p><p>with defensive countermeasures were landing. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) The Ambassador briefed Hamdan on the upcoming </p><p>meeting of Iraqi leaders in Nasiriya.  Hamdan </p><p>advised that he had just called KDP leader Massoud </p><p>Barzani for the first time.  Barzani thanked Hamdan </p><p>for reaching out to him and thanked the UAE for its </p><p>support in the victory. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
