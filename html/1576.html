FROWICK FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>REF (A) HOH/FROWICK EMAILS; (B) SARAJEVO 1096 AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01419  01 OF 02  131649Z </p><p>PREVIOUS; (C) STATE 43081; (D) FROWICK/SJOHNSON </p><p>EMAILS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  THE HOLY SEE DOES NOT SHARE THE </p><p>POLITICAL VIEWS OF THE BISHOP OF MOSTAR AND OTHER </p><p>CROAT-NATIONALIST CLERGY IN B-H AND IT IS DOING THE </p><p>UTMOST WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL LIMITS OF THE CHURCH </p><p>TO CHANGE THEIR POLITICAL BEHAVIOR.  OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS BELIEVE THE CLERGY\'S VALID CONCERNS ON </p><p>BEHALF OF THEIR FLOCK WERE REFLECTED IN MARCH 2 </p><p>LETTER CARDINAL PULJIC SENT PRESIDENT BUSH.  FOR </p><p>NOW, THE HOLY SEE\'S EFFORTS TO EFFECT CHANGE IN THE </p><p>HERZEGOVINIAN CLERGY ARE FOCUSED ON THE NUNCIO IN </p><p>SARAJEVO.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  A/DCM FOLLOWED UP ON REF A EXCHANGE IN A </p><p>3/9 MEETING WITH VATICAN BALKANS DIRECTOR MSGR. </p><p>JOSEPH MARINO.  IN THAT CONVERSATION, MARINO SAID </p><p>THAT HE HAD ALREADY HEARD ON THE ISSUE OF THE BISHOP </p><p>OF MOSTAR FROM SRSG JACQUES KLEIN 3/5.  FRENCH AMB. </p><p>TO THE HOLY SEE DEJAMMET ALSO CALLED 2/8.  MARINO </p><p>SAID THIS WAS CLEARLY HIS "ISSUE DU JOUR" AND THAT </p><p>HE HAD PREPARED A PAPER FOR FM TAURAN UPON THE </p><p>LATTER\'S RETURN FROM IRAN.  MARINO TOOK A/DCM\'S </p><p>POINT THAT BISHOP PERIC HAD OVERSTEPPED IN CALLING </p><p>FOR A UNILATERAL REVISION OF DAYTON AND IN PUBLICLY </p><p>SUPPORTING CONVICTED WAR CRIMINALS, BUT HE OPINED </p><p>THAT THE CROATS HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR MANY MONTHS </p><p>THAT THEIR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS HAVE BEEN LARGELY </p><p>IGNORED BY THE I/C.  WHEN A/DCM PRESSED FOR THE HOLY </p><p>SEE TO DO SOMETHING TO REIN-IN THE BISHOP, MARINO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01419  01 OF 02  131649Z </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE THE HOLY SEE </p><p>COULD DO OTHER THAN PULL THE BISHOP ASIDE FOR A </p><p>QUIET TALK (NOTE: SEE PARAS 5-6 FOR FURTHER </p><p>BACKGROUND ON THE LIMITS FACED BY THE HOLY SEE IN </p><p>DEALING WITH POLITICAL MATTERS INSIDE THE CHURCH. </p><p>FYI: TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, NEITHER PERIC NOR </p><p>PULJIC ARE FRANCISCAN; WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE </p><p>FRANCISCANS REPRESENT YET ANOTHER OBSTACLE TO INTER- </p><p>COMMUNAL RECONCILIATION IN B-H. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) A/DCM FOLLOWED UP REF C INSTRUCTION ON 2/13, </p><p>MEETING AGAIN WITH MSGR. MARINO.  AFTER HEARING THE </p><p>TALKING POINTS, MARINO ASSURED US THAT THE VATICAN </p><p>HAS HEARD THE SAME MESSAGE FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES </p><p>AND THAT IT WILL DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO TRY </p><p>TO CHANGE THE HERZEGOVINA CLERGY\'S BEHAVIOR.  HE </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE HOLY SEE IS ON RECORD </p><p>SUPPORTING A DEMOCRATIC AND MULTIETHNIC B-H, AND </p><p>THAT THIS POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>THE NUNCIO IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED UNDER INSTRUCTION </p><p>FROM THE HOLY SEE, HAS ALREADY SPOKEN WITH CARDINAL </p><p>PULJIC, AND WILL LIKELY SPEAK WITH BISHOP PERIC </p><p>SOON.  HE NOTED THAT PULJIC HAD SENT A LETTER TO </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH MARCH 2, AND THOUGHT THAT A HIGH- </p><p>LEVEL RESPONSE MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY FOR THE USG TO </p><p>REINFORCE THE NUNCIO\'S REPRESENTATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) A/DCM PRESSED ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT FROM THE HOLY SEE; IF NOT A DENUNCIATION </p><p>OF THE MOSTAR BISHOP THEN AT LEAST A RESTATEMENT OF </p><p>RELEVANT PASSAGES FROM THE PONTIFF\'S NEW YEARS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01419  01 OF 02  131649Z </p><p>MESSAGE SUPPORTING DEMOCRACY AND MULTIETHNIC/INTER- </p><p>COMMUNAL SOCIETIES.  MARINO REPLIED THAT THE CHURCH </p><p>WOULD NOT PUBLICLY DISAVOW OF ONE OF ITS OWN OVER A </p><p>POLITICAL MATTER, RECALLING THAT DURING THE PEOPLE </p><p>POWER REVOLUTION IN MANILA CARDINAL SIN WAS MORE </p><p>ACTIVE THAN THE CHURCH PREFERRED.  NOR IS THE HOLY </p><p>SEE CONTEMPLATING SENDING A HIGHER LEVEL OFFICIAL </p><p>FROM THE SECOND SECRETARIAT (NOTE: MFA EQUIVALENT) </p><p>TO REINFORCE THE NUNCIO\'S MESSAGE.  A/DCM RECALLED </p><p>THAT AS RECENTLY AS LAST SUNDAY THE PONTIFF </p><p> PUBLICLY </p><p>CONDEMNED BASQUE TERRORISM IN VERY STRONG TERMS EVEN </p><p>THOUGH THE BASQUE CHURCH IS NOTORIOUS FOR ITS </p><p>SUPPORT OF BASQUE INDEPENDENCE.  MARINO RESPONDED </p><p>THAT THERE IS A NEW BASQUE BISHOP WHO FULLY </p><p>SUPPORTED THE PONTIFF\'S STATEMENT; THE SITUATION IN </p><p>B-H, WHILE SIMILAR, IS THUS NOT FULLY ANALOGOUS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>BACKGROUND ON CHURCH DISCIPLINE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5767 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01419  02 OF 02  131649Z </p><p>ACTION ECA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  PC-01    SSO-00   SS-00    SNIS-00  NISC-00  DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------D11576  131653Z /38 </p><p>O 131705Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0000 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 001419 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/SCE (WETZEL), EUR/WE (VAN CLEVE), </p><p>EUR/BI; PD/ECA (SEXTON) </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO.-39/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL. 03/13/11 </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, BH, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE SEEKS UNDERSTANDING ON MANAGING </p><p>MOSTAR BISHOP </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) CATHOLIC BISHOPS ENJOY A UNIQUE AUTONOMY </p><p>WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT </p><p>FALL INTO THEOLOGICAL, MORAL OR SPIRITUAL ERROR, </p><p>THERE IS LITTLE THE POPE AND VATICAN OFFICIALS CAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01419  02 OF 02  131649Z </p><p>DO TO CORRECT A BISHOP\'S POLITICAL/POLITICAL </p><p>INDISCRETIONS, EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE THE INCLINATION </p><p>TO DO SO.  THE POPE IS THE SOLE JUDGE OF BISHOPS, </p><p>BUT HAS "JURIDICAL COMPETENCE" ONLY IN SPIRITUAL OR </p><p>ECCLESIASTICAL MATTERS.  IN THE LAST 100 YEARS, </p><p>CATHOLIC BISHOPS HAVE HELD A VARIETY OF POLITICAL </p><p>POSITIONS RANGING FROM NEAR-MARXIST SOCIALISM TO </p><p>HARD-LINE FASCISM, WITHOUT BEING DISCIPLINED BY THE </p><p>HOLY SEE.  THE POLITICAL POLICY OF POPES AND THE </p><p>VATICAN GOVERNMENT TENDS TO BE CENTRIST, BUT IT HAS </p><p>NEITHER THE AUTHORITY NOR, USUALLY, THE WILL TO </p><p>PROMOTE ONE POLITICAL EXPRESSION OVER ANOTHER. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU)  FURTHERMORE, UNDER THE PRINCIPLE KNOWN </p><p>AS SUBSIDIARITY IT IS VATICAN POLICY NOT TO CARRY </p><p>OUT AT A HIGHER LEVEL WHAT CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>ACHIEVED AT A LOWER LEVEL.  IF THE VATICAN WERE TO </p><p>HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT DIVISIVE NATIONALISTIC REMARKS </p><p>MADE BY AN OTHERWISE THEOLOGICALLY AND MORALLY </p><p>FAITHFUL CATHOLIC BISHOP, IT COULD BEGIN AN </p><p>INTERVENTION THROUGH THE LOCAL CATHOLIC HIERARCHY: A </p><p>NEIGHBORING BISHOP, THEN A SENIOR BISHOP, THEN </p><p>PERHAPS THE PAPAL NUNCIO. THIS APPROACH HAS WORKED </p><p>IN THE PAST WHERE THE BISHOPS\' COUNCIL IS LARGE, AND </p><p>CONTAINS BISHOPS WITH POLITICAL VIEWS SYMPATHETIC TO </p><p>THOSE OF THE HOLY SEE (NOTE: APPARENTLY NOT THE CASE </p><p>IN B-H) . </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01419  02 OF 02  131649Z </p><p>7.  (C)  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CROATIA AND B-H IS A </p><p>FIERCELY LOYAL SUPPORTER OF THE PRESENT POPE AND OF </p><p>THE VATICAN.  IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE HOLY SEE WOULD </p><p>WISH TO PUBLICLY CHASTISE A CROATIAN BISHOP, </p><p>APPOINTED BY POPE JOHN PAUL II, FOR EXCEEDING THE </p><p>BOUNDS OF POLITICAL PRUDENCE.  POST HAS OVER PAST </p><p>MONTHS DISCUSSED WITH THE VATICAN AS WELL AS WITH </p><p>OTHER CONTACTS POSSIBLE AVENUES TO TAME THE MOSTAR </p><p>BISHOP\'S MORE DESTRUCTIVE NATIONALIST IMPULSES. </p><p>POST WOULD BE INTERESTED IN WHETHER THE BISHOPS OF </p><p>THE CROAT BISHOPS CONFERENCE SUPPORT PERIC\'S </p><p>ACTIVITY.  FOR NOW, WE ARE SEEKING TO DEVELOP AN </p><p>INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE (REF D) WITH THE </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY, IN LARGE PART TO TRY TO BRING </p><p>PERIC OUT OF THE CROAT-NATIONALIST POLITICAL </p><p>WILDERNESS. </p><p>MERANTE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA01419 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
