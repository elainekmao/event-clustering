<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 003536 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, INR/NESA, DRL, S/P </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PREL, PHUM, PGOV, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) POLITICAL ISLAM WORKING GROUP:  KUWAIT SNAPSHOT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 205815 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This cable responds to reftel request for "brief </p><p>thumbnail descriptions" of Kuwait\'s "most influential or </p><p>prominent Islamist political parties, NGO\'s, individuals or </p><p>university campus activist groups."  Formal political parties </p><p>are not permitted in Kuwait, but de facto parties exist, and </p><p>those with the strongest identity tend to be Islamist.  The </p><p>most significant of the Sunni movements are: </p><p> </p><p>- The Islamic Constitutional Movement:  the political arm of </p><p>the (Sunni) Muslim Brotherhood in Kuwait.  ICM was the </p><p>strongest Islamist grouping in the National Assembly until </p><p>the July 5 elections, when it suffered major losses.  The </p><p>reasons for this debacle are not yet clear, and may have a </p><p>lot to do with the nature of the balloting:  single-round, </p><p>first-two-past-the-post in each of 25 constituencies, in </p><p>which it is possible to be elected with fewer than one </p><p>thousand votes.  Prominent ICM\'ers include Chairman Issa </p><p>Majed al-Shaheen and MPs Dr. Nasser al-Sane, Mikhlid al-Azmi </p><p>and Mohammed al-Bossairi.  ICM MPs who failed to win </p><p>reelection were Mubarak al-Duwaila, Mubarak Snaidih, and </p><p>Abdullah al-Arada.  The Social Reform Society (jam\'iyat </p><p>al-islah al-ijtima\'i) is the social welfare arm of the Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood in Kuwait, and is widely regarded in Kuwait as a </p><p>reputable charity.  Nonetheless, its affiliate Lajnat </p><p>al-da\'wa al-islamiya (LDI) was placed on the UN\'s terrorist </p><p>finance list at the request of France; ICM denies the charge </p><p>and has lobbied the French and US embassies to clear LDI\'s </p><p>name. </p><p> </p><p>- The Salafi Call (al-da\'wa al-salafiya), aka The </p><p>(Traditional) Salafis:  strict Sunnis heavily influenced by </p><p>the Saudi Wahhabi brand of Islam.  Generally seen as more </p><p>hard-line than ICM, but there is some overlap:  Salafis claim </p><p>that many ICM members are increasingly following the Salafi </p><p>way.  This bloc portrays itself as D (willing to engage in a </p><p>democratic, pluralistic process and respect the rights of </p><p>others as well as the principle of alternance of governance) </p><p>but its opponents view it as C (willing to engage in a </p><p>democratic, pluralistic process but, if given full power, </p><p>would not respect the rights of non-Islamists, secularists, </p><p>and/or minorities).  Minister of Justice Ahmed Baqer is a </p><p>Salafi; until this month, he also held the Awqaf and Islamic </p><p>Affairs portfolio.  Baqer was elected to the National </p><p>Assembly under the banner of the Popular Islamic Grouping, </p><p>along with Dr. Fahd al-Khanna and Jassem al-Kandari (Note: </p><p>Kandari is also variously described as Independent and </p><p>Scientific Salafi).  MPs Dr. Adel al-Sar\'awi, Faisal </p><p>al-Msallam, and Dr. Dhaifallah Bou Ramya, nominally </p><p>Independent, are seen as being Salafis (Sar\'awi and Msallam </p><p>enjoyed the support of ICM as well).  Ahmed al-Duaij lost his </p><p>reelection bid.  The social welfare arm of this movement is </p><p>the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society (RIHS, jam\'iyat ahiya </p><p>al-turath al-islami), widely regarded in Kuwait as a </p><p>reputable charity.  Its chairman Tareq al-Issa eschews </p><p>politics, though his predecessor Khaled Sultan al-Issa is </p><p>politically engaged.  RIHS\'s Pakistan branch and Afghanistan </p><p>project office, now both defunct, were placed on the UN\'s </p><p>terrorist finance list more than one year ago; the parent </p><p>organization disavows any knowledge of improper use of funds. </p><p> </p><p>- The Salafi Movement (al-haraka al-salafiya), aka The </p><p>Scientific Salafis:  a hard-line offshoot of the Salafi Call. </p><p> Its Secretary-General Dr. Hakem al-Mutairi faces criminal </p><p>charges for falsely complaining of GOK torture of Kuwaitis </p><p>returned from Afghanistan.  Other prominent Scientific </p><p>Salafis include MPs Dr. Waleed al-Tabtabaei, Dr. Awad Barad </p><p>al-Enezi, Abdullah Akkash.  Kuwait University professor Dr. </p><p>Abdul-Razzaq al-Shaiji told Pol Chief last fall that he </p><p>condemned attacks on Americans in Kuwait but preached jihad </p><p>against the American forces in Afghanistan, and made no </p><p>secret of his admiration for the Taliban. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) About a third of Kuwaitis are Shia.  Some are very </p><p>liberal, but four Shiite Islamists were elected to the new </p><p>National Assembly:  Dr. Hassan Jowhar, Saleh Ashour, Yousef </p><p>al-Zalzala, Salah Khorshid (Trade and Industry Minister in </p><p>the last Cabinet) and Hussein al-Qallaf, a sayyed (descendant </p><p>of the Prophet Mohammed) who wears the distinctive black </p><p>turban.  Ashour and Zalzala are viewed as </p><p>"independent/government leaning." Khorshid was Minister of </p><p>Commerce in the previous government and generally responsive </p><p>to US requests.  Shiite MPs who failed to win reelection were </p><p>Adnan Abdul-Samad and Abdul-Mohsen Jamal.  Shiite Islamists </p><p>dismiss allegations that they belong to Kuwaiti Hizballah, </p><p>saying the only real Hizballah is in Lebanon.  Kuwaiti </p><p>Shiites have by all accounts lost their enthusiasm for the </p><p>Iranian revolution and reacted to the Iraqi occupation by </p><p>gaining a greater sense of being Kuwaitis first.  Although </p><p>overt discrimination against Shia is less pronounced in </p><p>Kuwait than in some other Gulf States, they still have their </p><p>grievances.  For example, there is no independent Shia Awquf. </p><p>There is also no Shiite seminary in Kuwait; would-be clerics </p><p>must travel to Qom in Iran or Najaf in Iraq; the latter </p><p>opportunity did not exist for the past twelve years, but the </p><p>liberation of Iraq has changed that. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Kuwait is a rich country; we do not believe that </p><p>external funding plays any significant role in any of the </p><p>above Islamist groups, with the possible exception of </p><p>Shiites, some of whom clearly have ties to the Iranian </p><p>regime.  All of the above groups portray themselves as </p><p>falling under reftel category D (willing to engage in a </p><p>democratic, pluralistic process and respect the rights of </p><p>others as well as the principle of alternance of governance), </p><p>but their opponents say they all really fall under category C </p><p>(willing to engage in a democratic, pluralistic process but, </p><p>if given full power, would not respect the rights of </p><p>non-Islamists, secularists, and/or minorities).  All have </p><p>shown willingness to form tactical alliances with those who </p><p>do not share many of their views, in order to achieve a </p><p>particular shared purpose.  In theory, all oppose the </p><p>existence of the State of Israel, and most (at least the </p><p>Sunnis) oppose political rights for women.  To varying </p><p>degrees, and with some exceptions, expressed significant </p><p>reservations to the US invading Arab/Muslim Iraq, though they </p><p>loathed Saddam\'s regime.  (One notable exception was Khaled </p><p>Sultan al-Issa, former Chairman of RIHS and a prominent </p><p>Traditional Salafi:  having been imprisoned and tortured by </p><p>the Iraqis during the 1990-91 occupation, he had no problem </p><p>with the idea of American infidels destroying Saddam\'s regime </p><p>by force.)  All profess to accept the legitimacy of the </p><p>Kuwaiti regime and the presence of US forces in Kuwait as </p><p>invited guests and protectors.  That said, they are deeply </p><p>suspicious of US pressure for western-style reforms, and can </p><p>be expected to try to delegitimize any attempted reforms -- </p><p>even if we have nothing to do with them -- on grounds that we </p><p>are trying to impose our alien ways. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) A few Kuwaitis, numbering perhaps several hundred, </p><p>are actively hostile to the US presence in Kuwait.  They tend </p><p>to cluster around Kuwaitis who went to Afghanistan to support </p><p>the Taliban regime and/or receive training from al-Qaeda.  An </p><p>influential figure for these (Sunni) extremists is the minor </p><p>cleric Jaber al-Jalahma; he was arrested after allegedly </p><p>praising as martyrs the terrorists who killed US Marine Lance </p><p>Cpl. Antonio Sledd in October 2002.  That attack shocked the </p><p>Kuwaiti government and public, and led to an energetic </p><p>investigation by the security services. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) There are no pre-eminent Islamic religious leaders in </p><p>Kuwait.  Salafis look primarily to Saudi Arabia for guidance, </p><p>but have not yet settled on a single spiritual leader since </p><p>the death of prominent Saudi Aalim Shaykh Bin Baz.  The most </p><p>respected Sunni cleric in Kuwait may be Dr. Ajeel al-Neshmi, </p><p>who was the first to condemn the murder of Sledd as forbidden </p><p>by Islam.  He eschews politics and has declined to meet with </p><p>Emboffs.  The young Dean of the Faculty of Sharia at Kuwait </p><p>University, Dr. Mohammed al-Tabtabaei, took the initiative to </p><p>organize seminars to explain proper Islamic teaching in the </p><p>aftermath of the Sledd killing, and did meet with Emboffs, </p><p>but stressed that he was doing so at risk to his reputation. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) A number of Islamists who have studied in the West </p><p>are adept at presenting themselves and their agenda in </p><p>positive terms.  In all cases that we have encountered, </p><p>however, they start from a different premise than we do: </p><p>theirs is not a pluralistic society, but a Muslim one, and </p><p>their goal is for Kuwait to adhere more closely to the tenets </p><p>of Islam as they understand it.  Perhaps the most open-minded </p><p>Islamist figure we have met here is Dr. Ayyoub Khaled </p><p>al-Ayyoub, Secretary General of the Higher Consultative </p><p>Committee for the Finalization of the Application of the </p><p>Provisions of the Islamic Sharia (part of the Amiri Diwan). </p><p>Dr. Ayyoub studied in the US and England; he gives regular </p><p>talks on the radio, and in one that we heard, he described </p><p>instances in which the non-Muslim British displayed "true </p><p>Islamic behavior" by their honesty and neighborliness. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Ever since the naturalization in the 1970s of large </p><p>numbers of Bedouin, Kuwaiti society has become more insular </p><p>and conservative -- fertile ground for the Islamists. </p><p>Kuwait\'s dependence on the US for protection against Saddam, </p><p>along with its role as the launching pad for Operation Iraqi </p><p>Freedom, has led to charges from other Arabs that it has </p><p>betrayed its Arab and Muslim identity.  Kuwaitis at all </p><p>levels are clearly sensitive to such allegations which lead </p><p>to a feeling of cognitive dissonance on the part of all but </p><p>the most Westernized.  The more the US role in the region and </p><p>the world seems overwhelmingly dominant, the more we can </p><p>expect Kuwaitis to assert/defend their identity in contrast </p><p>to us; almost by definition, the most socially acceptable way </p><p>for them to do so is to show Islamic fervor. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) By regional standards, there is a great deal of </p><p>freedom in Kuwait.  The privately-owned press is vocal and </p><p>often criticizes the government; the same can be said of the </p><p>National Assembly.  While not formally recognized as parties, </p><p>a number of political blocs do exist.  Unity of perspective </p><p>and of agenda is perhaps easier for Islamists to achieve than </p><p>for secular liberals, who range from Marxists and </p><p>Pan-Arabists to pro-American free-marketeers.  A major </p><p>challenge for the US in the months and years ahead will be to </p><p>avoid being perceived as the common enemy against which </p><p>Islamists and other conservative forces can unite. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
