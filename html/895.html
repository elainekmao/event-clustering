<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KARACHI 001443 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/20/07 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NARC, PTER, AF, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: TALIBAN REP ON NARCOTICS AND BIN LADEN </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY DOUGLAS B. ARCHARD, CONSUL GENERAL, </p><p>AMCONGEN KARACHI. REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CONSUL GENERAL JOINED HIS TALIBAN COUNTERPARTS FOR A </p><p>BRIEF CHAT DURING A DINNER AT THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S AUGUST </p><p>20TH.  THE TALIBAN CONSUL GENERAL IS A FIFTY-ISH, MIDDLE- </p><p>SIZED MAN NAMED MAULVI ABDULLAH HAMAD, WHOM WE HAD NOT MET </p><p>BEFORE.  HE HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE SEPTEMBER 1996 AND HAILS </p><p>FROM HELMAND.  HE SPEAKS NO ENGLISH BUT SOME URDU.  WE KNOW </p><p>HIS NUMBER TWO, THIRD SECRETARY HAFIZULLAH SAFI, WHO HAS </p><p>LIVED IN KARACHI FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND HOLDS AN MA IN </p><p>ISLAMIC STUDIES FROM KARACHI UNIVERSITY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) WE WORKED THE SUBJECT AROUND TO NARCOTICS.  SAFI </p><p>ADMITTED THAT SOME --"A LITTLE"-- OPIUM WAS GROWN IN </p><p>TALIBAN-CONTROLLED AREA, ESPECIALLY HELMAND, BUT WAS USED </p><p>ONLY FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES.  HE SAID HIS MOVEMENT HAD </p><p>STRICTLY FORBIDDEN THE MANUFACTURE OF HEROINE AND HASHISH. </p><p>WE DID NOT DISPUTE HIS CLAIM. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CONSUL GENERAL ALSO ASKED ABOUT "THAT SAUDI PRINCE," </p><p>WHO WAS IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED AS OSAMA BIN LADEN.  SAFI </p><p>LAUNCHED INTO AN EXPLANATION OF BIN LADEN\'S PRESENCE IN </p><p>TALIBAN TERRITORY WHICH TOOK THE STANDARD LINE: BIN LADEN </p><p>HAD BEEN A GOOD MUJAHID FOR A DOZEN OR MORE YEARS.  HE </p><p>REMAINED IN AFGHANISTAN ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT HE AVOID </p><p>ANY INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM DIRECTED AGAINST THE WEST OR </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) WE ASKED IF HE HAD VIEWED THE PETER ARNETT CNN </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH BIN LADEN.  HE CLAIMED NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE </p><p>INTERVIEW AND ASKED FOR A SUMMARY.  CONSUL GENERAL EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT BIN LADEN HAD VOWED ACTION AGAINST AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA.  HE INVITED SAFI TO COME TO TEA AT JOHNSON </p><p>HOUSE TO VIEW THE TAPE.  SAFI UNDERTOOK TO DO SO, WE THINK. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: NOT ALL THAT MUCH SUBSTANCE THERE, OR </p><p>PERHAPS MUCH REALITY BUT WHAT SEEMS CLEAR IS THAT THE </p><p>TALIBAN ARE GETTING OUR MESSAGES.  WE SUSPECT THAT THEIR </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS WITH KANDAHAR ARE NOT THAT PERFECT BUT THEY </p><p>APPEAR TO BE TELLING ONE ANOTHER WHAT U.S. CONCERNS ARE. </p><p>WE ARE IN THE CULTIVATING MODE WITH THESE PEOPLE, WHOM WE </p><p>MEET ONLY FLEETINGLY.  WE HAD LUCK IN GETTING SAFI OVER TO </p><p>HEAR OUR PITCH ON PRESERVING THE BUDDHIST MONUMENTS AT </p><p>BAMIYAN.  WE\'LL TRY TO GET HIM TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE </p><p>ARNETT TAPE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARCHARD </p><p></p></div>
