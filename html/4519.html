<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 010952 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, GM </p><p>SUBJECT:  BADEN-WUERTTEMBERG GREEN PARTY EXPRESSES </p><p>FRUSTRATION WITH NATIONAL GREEN PARTY LEADERS AND THE SPD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary:  On November 23, the Baden-Wuerttemberg (B- </p><p>W) Greens held their first state convention since the </p><p>September national elections to discuss policy.  Leading B-W </p><p>party leaders such as caucus chief Winfried Kretschmann and </p><p>Freiburg Lord Mayor Dieter Salomon are concerned about the </p><p>viability of the national SPD-Green Party coalition.  They </p><p>cautioned the national leadership not to allow the party to </p><p>be dragged down by the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which </p><p>has been heavily criticized in the weeks since September\'s </p><p>national elections for breaking campaign promises.  Some </p><p>even called for forming a coalition with the Christian </p><p>Democratic Union (CDU), but were not supported by the </p><p>majority of the assembled delegates.  The overall mood was </p><p>anger at the SPD, general frustration with Berlin leadership </p><p>and the direction of the Green Party.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Kuhn Speaks of Severe Crisis </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Baden-Wuerttemberg (B-W) Green Party met in </p><p>Esslingen on November 23 to discuss policy.  It was the </p><p>party\'s first meeting since its strong showing in last </p><p>September\'s national elections.  In his keynote address the </p><p>delegates, national chairman Fritz Kuhn admitted that the </p><p>national government and the Green Party is in severe crisis. </p><p>The proposed increase in pension contributions and the </p><p>extension for the Obrigheim nuclear reactor (contrary to </p><p>nuclear phase-out plans) are big setbacks in terms of Green </p><p>Party policy priorities.  Kuhn urged the Greens\' federal- </p><p>level coalition partner, the SPD, to tell voters the truth </p><p>about public budget issues.  Half of Germany\'s 16 states </p><p>have budgets in violation of state constitutional </p><p>guidelines.  Kuhn suggested that extensive structural </p><p>reforms of the pension and health system were needed, along </p><p>with consolidation of the budget, a new program to assist </p><p>start-up companies, and a continuation of the eco-tax. </p><p>According to Kuhn, a broadening of the basis for assessing </p><p>social contributions is an absolute necessity.  This </p><p>expanded basis may include earnings from rents and other </p><p>private income such as from investments. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Unlike the SPD, the Green draws most of its support </p><p>from small and medium-sized businesses, Kuhn continued.  The </p><p>SPD, with support from large corporations, does not </p><p>understand that bigger companies are much more capable of </p><p>dealing with non-wage labor cost increases than companies </p><p>with only a handful of employees.  Kuhn also insisted that </p><p>the Green Party would not tolerate an increase in the value- </p><p>added tax since this would be an additional blow to </p><p>stumbling economic growth.  Kuhn sharply attacked the </p><p>Christian Democrats for lacking in constructive alternative </p><p>suggestions for economic reform.  He dismissed the CDU </p><p>investigative committee on alleged election fraud by SPD- </p><p>Greens as a "waste of time." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Salomon Expects SPD/Green Government Will Fail </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Kuhn\'s speech received only moderate applause.  In </p><p>the two-hour discussion that followed, leading B-W Greens </p><p>voiced their frustration, anger and disappointment at the </p><p>performance of the governing Party coalition.  Freiburg </p><p>Green Lord Mayor Dieter Salomon delivered a rousing speech, </p><p>urging the Berlin leadership to reverse disastrous recent </p><p>developments.  He received a standing ovation.  He warned </p><p>the party that good poll results did not mean support for </p><p>Green policies but a reaction to SPD failings: the FDP did </p><p>similarly well during the CDU donation scandal.  The SPD, </p><p>according to Salomon, does not understand that, "This is its </p><p>last chance to achieve important reforms.  Instead, </p><p>Schroeder is allowing labor unions to lead him around by the </p><p>nose while the economy runs aground."  Salomon criticized </p><p>Kuhn for not saying anything new.  The Green Party has the </p><p>right ideas, but Berlin leaders are not implementing them, </p><p>Salomon said. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Salomon told the delegates that public mood is so </p><p>bad that the 11 percent the Greens won in recent polls would </p><p>"melt like snow in the sun."  Salomon criticized the tax </p><p>reform for being well-intentioned but ill-conceived and </p><p>undermining the financial basis of the communities.  Using </p><p>his own city as an example, Freiburg\'s budget deficit will </p><p>reach 80 million Euro in 2003, which will mean the loss of </p><p>several hundred jobs in the city administration.  In that </p><p>context, Salomon blasted the chief of Ver.di (the service </p><p>workers union) Frank Bzirske for demanding a three percent </p><p>plus increase in wages.  "The Chancellor is in nirvana and </p><p>the Greens stick blindly to the coalition agreement.  The </p><p>federal government will fail with these irresponsible </p><p>economic policies.  It is better the Green Party leave the </p><p>coalition now, than be dragged under by Social Democratic </p><p>chaos." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Eugen Schlachter, a close friend of the former Green </p><p>Party financial expert Oswald Metzger, also called on the </p><p>Green leadership in Berlin to change coalition partners </p><p>rather than continue with damaging compromises.  Otherwise, </p><p>the Green Party may go under with the SPD.  In a sharp stab </p><p>at SPD Secretary General Olaf Scholz\'s statement that the </p><p>SPD should control the policy discussion on children\'s </p><p>education and upbringing Schlachter stated "whoever talks </p><p>such nonsense is unsuitable for a governing coalition." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>CDU Needs to Make the First Step </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Green Bundestag members did not welcome the </p><p>suggestions by some rank and file members that the Green </p><p>Party should change coalition partners.  B-W Caucus Chief </p><p>Winfried Kretschmann pointed out that Greens and CDU have </p><p>many things in common but said, "The CDU is still too weak </p><p>on environmental issues."  It is up to the CDU to make the </p><p>first move to show it is taking environmental issues </p><p>seriously.  Kretschmann said the national Green leadership </p><p>in Berlin needed to remember its roots in the state party </p><p>and improve communication.  He also said that the extension </p><p>of the Obrigheim nuclear reactor\'s operating license should </p><p>have never happened. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Comment: The recent convention shows that the </p><p>Green Party rank and file in the party\'s southwest heartland </p><p>is no longer willing to keep quiet.  Fear, anger and </p><p>frustration are growing among the Greens that the crisis in </p><p>the national government, in their view the fault of the SPD, </p><p>will drag them down.  Green Party leaders in Berlin are seen </p><p>as too eager to please the SPD and too willing to compromise </p><p>on key issues.  The Green Party convention in Esslingen made </p><p>clear that some in the party believe a change of coalition </p><p>partner is necessary.  Green Party members at the convention </p><p>also told us that interpersonal relationships between SPD </p><p>and Green partners have been severely damaged in the past </p><p>several weeks, further eroding cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
