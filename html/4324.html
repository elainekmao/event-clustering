<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 006699 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, SY, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MUASHER ON CAIRO AL MINISTERIAL:  SHARA, IRAQ AND </p><p>THE QUARTET ROADMAP </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  NEA DAS David Satterfield called on Foreign Minister </p><p>Marwan Muasher November 13.  Ambassador, PolCouns, Muasher\'s </p><p>personal aide Ali al-Ayed, and private office staffer Ashraf </p><p>Zeitoun also attended. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE PRESSES IRAQ TO ACCEPT 1441 </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Muasher said that the Cairo Arab League ministerial </p><p>meeting had dealt mostly with Iraq.  Most delegations had </p><p>urged Iraqi FonMin Sabri to announce official Iraqi </p><p>acceptance of UNSCR 1441 at the meeting, but Sabri said he </p><p>had no specific guidance from Baghdad.  His only substantive </p><p>comment on 1441 was that "Iraq has always accepted the return </p><p>of inspectors -- the rest of the resolution is technical </p><p>detail that we are studying."  Muasher said Saudi FonMin </p><p>Prince Saud pressed hard for quick Iraqi acceptance of 1441, </p><p>arguing that if Iraq did so, the AL could "lend support and </p><p>make Iraq\'s case." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>SHARA ON SYRIA\'S UNSC VOTE ON IRAQ </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Muasher commented that Syrian FonMin Shara gave a </p><p>long intervention explaining Syria\'s UNSC vote for 1441. </p><p>Shara said Syria had worked within the tight "margins of </p><p>movement" set by UNSC members, and had tried to improve the </p><p>resolution as much as possible.  Shara claimed that Syria had </p><p>gotten assurances from (unnamed) permanent UNSC members that </p><p>this resolution would not be used as a pretext to launch </p><p>military action against Iraq.  Syria voted for the resolution </p><p>because it needed to remain within the international </p><p>consensus on Iraq.  Shara, Muasher said, concluded by asking </p><p>Iraq to comply with 1441. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>SYRIA ON 1441 EQUATES TO JORDAN ON ROADMAP? </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Muasher commented "We are always under pressure from </p><p>Syria for giving in to less than perfect initiatives."  He </p><p>said that, following Shara\'s statement, he spoke and compared </p><p>Syria\'s efforts in the UNSC to improve UNSCR 1441 with </p><p>Jordan\'s efforts with the Quartet to improve the MEPP </p><p>Roadmap.  Muasher said he argued that the Roadmap will not be </p><p>perfect from an Arab point of view, but Jordan, like Syria in </p><p>the UNSC, must work within externally imposed boundaries.  In </p><p>the end, however, Jordan had had "the time to coordinate with </p><p>our Arab brothers that Syria did not have." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  This comment, an obviously amused Muasher said, made </p><p>Shara "climb right up the wall."  Shara responded that there, </p><p>in reality, was no such thing as a road map -- he had asked </p><p>A/S Burns to see a copy when he last traveled to Damascus and </p><p>had gotten no response.  Muasher said he shot back that the </p><p>Roadmap, once publicly announced and endorsed by the Quartet, </p><p>would be the considered opinion of the international </p><p>community on the Peace Process and Syria would have to accept </p><p>it.  "Don\'t pretend it doesn\'t exist," Muasher said he </p><p>argued, "Try to improve it."  Muasher ended by observing that </p><p>the Ba\'ath party in general -- and the Syrian Ba\'ath in </p><p>particular -- fostered a mentality that was very hard to </p><p>reconcile with reality. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Amb. Satterfield has cleared this message. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
