One conservative writer calls for Jihad as the </p><p>only option for Palestinians in an editorial titled, "No </p><p>Peace With Them." </p><p> </p><p>An Islamist writer cites recent Congressional hearings on </p><p>possible civil rights violations after September 11 as proof </p><p>of US hypocrisy: "America tries to demonstrate to the world </p><p>the ideal vision of democracy and human rights while it </p><p>holds inside ugly contradictions and shameful practices." </p><p> </p><p>Another commentator blames the US-led campaigns in </p><p>Afghanistan and Iraq for an "increase in terrorism" that has </p><p>resulted in a "world living in a state of shock and terror." </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: Al-Rai Al-Aam reports on June 15 State </p><p>Minister for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah\'s </p><p>strong denunciation of Israeli "assassination operations," </p><p>saying such operations are a form of terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>On June 16, all dailies carry front-page coverage of the </p><p>burial of the remains of the second identified Kuwaiti POW, </p><p>Ahmad Al-Qallaf. </p><p> </p><p>The Minister of Information Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahd\'s comments </p><p>on Al-Jazeera, accusing the satellite news channel of </p><p>"unprofessionalism" and of broadcasting "false" information </p><p>about Kuwait, appear on the front pages of all dailies on </p><p>June 14. </p><p> </p><p>Al Anba reports on June 14 the Kuwaiti Minister of Interior </p><p>Sheikh Mohammed Al-Khaled\'s visit to Iran will include </p><p>discussion of reports that Iranian authorities have </p><p>apprehended Al-Qaeda spokesman, Suleiman Bu Gheith, along </p><p>with other Kuwaitis who have fled Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>On June 14, all newspapers report that Kuwaiti border </p><p>patrols sabotaged two attempts by Iraqis to infiltrate </p><p>across the border into Kuwait, one of which aimed at </p><p>smuggling 14 kilograms of hashish into Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports on June 15 that two candidates for the July </p><p>5 parliamentary elections have withdrawn, reducing the total </p><p>number of candidates to 274 for the fifty National Assembly </p><p>seats. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "No Peace with Them" </p><p>Conservative Dr. Sami Nasser Al-Khalifa wrote in independent </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam (6/14):  "In his attempt to assassinate </p><p>[senior leader of Hamas Abdul Aziz] Al-Rantissi, Sharon has </p><p>proven that any so-called `peace\' cannot be achieved unless </p><p>the Palestinians surrender to the Zionist\'s will, or Arabs </p><p>and Muslims are subjugated under the new `Road Map plan\' . </p><p>We have no choice but to resort to the Quran, because verses </p><p>on Jihad mentioned in many Surras state that war should have </p><p>one objective: boosting the Almighty\'s religion. In other </p><p>words, war means to fight [for] a divine project." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "The Burned-Bodies Dialogue" </p><p>Dr. Ayyed Al-Manna wrote in independent Al-Watan (6/14): </p><p>"The religious and the political extremists on both sides, </p><p>the Israelis and the Palestinians are engaged in the burned </p><p>bodies dialogue. The Palestinians attack the Israelis with </p><p>explosive belts while the Israelis respond back by attacking </p><p>the Palestinians using the Apache helicopters and tanks. </p><p>What is the aim of this dialogue? As long as both parties </p><p>have not reached the point of exhaustion, then the burned- </p><p>bodies dialogue will be seen as the most effective means to </p><p>achieve the final goal." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The American Terrorism" </p><p>Abdel Aziz Al-Hindal wrote in independent Al-Qabas (6/14): </p><p>"In Afghanistan, the US found out that most of the people </p><p>who died during the war were civilians. As for Iraq, many </p><p>Iraqi soldiers and civilian remained neutral, leaving the </p><p>fighting to the Baathists.  The result of both wars was that </p><p>the leaders of those countries remained alive to respond </p><p>against the US. Consequently, terrorism has spread </p><p>throughout the world, and security authorities must be on </p><p>alert at all times in order to confront any possible </p><p>terrorist attack. The result of the two wars waged under the </p><p>pretext of combating terrorism is an increased number of </p><p>terrorist attacks. As a result of American polices, the </p><p>world lives in a state of shock and terror." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "America is Violating Civil Rights" </p><p>Islamist Adel Al-Qassar wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(6/15):  "On June 4, 2003, the American Congress held a </p><p>session organized by a coalition of American civil rights </p><p>organizations to listen to a number of victims whose civil </p><p>rights were violated after September 11 attacks. US </p><p>Congressman [Ted] Kennedy stated that many American laws </p><p>include articles that are discriminatory and should be </p><p>revised. It is regrettable that some people defend America </p><p>more than the Americans themselves. America tries to </p><p>demonstrate to the world the ideal vision of democracy and </p><p>human rights while it holds inside ugly contradictions and </p><p>shameful practices." </p><p> </p><p>7.  Radical Islamist Mohammad Al-Mulaifi wrote in </p><p>independent Al-Seyassah (6/15): "Those who came under the </p><p>pretext of providing freedom and liberation to the Iraqis </p><p>have not found any Iraqi that deserves to lead the country </p><p>according to the American wishes. In other words, they have </p><p>not found a `new Karzai\' on which the White House can </p><p>depend. The US Administration has gone beyond the freedom of </p><p>Iraq by appointing Noah Wildman, a Jew that holds American </p><p>and Israeli citizenship, to prepare a new Iraqi constitution </p><p>which will be the basis for establishing a new regime in an </p><p>American Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
