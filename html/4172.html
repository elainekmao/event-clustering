<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002990 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 10/29/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: YORUBA TRADITIONAL RULER SAYS </p><p>OBASANJO THE THE ONLY THING HOLDING NIGERIA TOGETHER </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reason </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: During an October 22 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, the Ooni of Ife declared that </p><p>Nigeria would disintegrate if President Obasanjo were </p><p>not reelected.  The most influential Yoruba </p><p>traditional ruler, Ooni Sijuwade claimed that the </p><p>desire of Northern politicians to control national </p><p>politics and the government bursary fueled the current </p><p>opposition to Obasanjo.  Sijuwade claimed, however, </p><p>that many traditional rulers, including the North\'s </p><p>most influential leader, the Emir of Kano, backed </p><p>Obasanjo.  Despite his incessant legerdemain, former </p><p>Head of State Babangida eventually would back </p><p>Obasanjo, and VP Atiku would not try to supplant the </p><p>President.  The claim that failure to reelect Obasanjo </p><p>would be Nigeria\'s death knell raises concern but is </p><p>less an objective assessment than an example of the </p><p>exaggerated lexicon of Southern Nigerian politics; </p><p>yet,  Sijuwade\'s observations are those of an long- </p><p>time insider and an accomplished political player. </p><p>While inflated for effect, his remarks demonstrate </p><p>that regional competition and tensions are </p><p>intensifying as 2003 elections approach.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) During an October 20-23 visit to Lagos, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter traveled to Ile-Ife, the legendary </p><p>home of the Yoruba ethnic group, to officially call on </p><p>the Ooni of Ife, the Southwest\'s most influential </p><p>traditional ruler.  Ambassador Jeter was accompanied </p><p>by his Staff Assistant and PolCouns.  Receiving </p><p>Ambassador Jeter and party at his shaded poolside </p><p>patio and hosting them for a mid-afternoon lunch, Ooni </p><p>Sijuwade discussed national politics for the better </p><p>part of four hours. The Ooni clearly had prepared for </p><p>the visit. Beside his imperial chair was a stack of </p><p>letters, newspapers and other documents he repeatedly </p><p>referred to during the course of the session in order </p><p>to confirm or emphasize a matter he thought important. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Straight to the point, Sijuwade declared that </p><p>Nigeria risked secession and disintegration if </p><p>Obasanjo did not return in 2003. The Ooni revisited </p><p>this theme over and over during the lengthy meeting, </p><p>at one point exclaiming that "if Obasanjo were not on </p><p>seat in 2003, there will not be a Nigeria!"  The Ooni </p><p>contended that Obasanjo\'s high integrity was the cause </p><p>of his low popularity.  The expectations of too many </p><p>Nigerian politicians was "to rob" government coffers. </p><p>Politicians expected Obasanjo to throw open the doors </p><p>to the vault; however, he has frustrated their greed </p><p>by standing in the way, Sijuwade contended.  Because </p><p>of his stand for fiscal probity, Obasanjo was under </p><p>intense political heat.  Sijuwade claimed that, as </p><p>spiritual head of the Yorubas, he had predicted to </p><p>Obasanjo a rough reelection campaign after the latter </p><p>had announced his reelection bid in April. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Sijuwade pointed to the President\'s tussle </p><p>with the National Assembly over the budget as </p><p>confirming his assessment of the pervasiveness of </p><p>political greed. The Ooni chastised the National </p><p>Assembly for trying to force Obasanjo to implement </p><p>their highly inflated budget that would have resulted </p><p>in a massive deficit.  The reason the Legislature\'s </p><p>proposed budget was so massively in the red was that </p><p>the Assembly sought an additional 240 billion Naira in </p><p>special projects so that each Member could access one </p><p>half billion Naira.  Because many of these Members </p><p>were facing tough reelection battles or were </p><p>unelectable, the proposed outlay would help some eke </p><p>out victory or constitute a lucrative golden handshake </p><p>for others.  Sijuwade scoffed that House Speaker Ghali </p><p>Na\'Abba sponsorship of the impeachment threat was pure </p><p>hypocrisy because Na\'Abba was a wastrel, guilty of </p><p>scores of financial improprieties in funding his and </p><p>his crony\'s spendthrift ways. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Making a spirited pitch for USG support for </p><p>Obasanjo, Sijuwade claimed most Nigerians were </p><p>unfamiliar with the US-style presidential system of </p><p>government, but that Obasanjo had brought it to </p><p>Nigeria.  To most Nigerians, Obasanjo was "regarded as </p><p>America," he asserted.  (Comment: This reference was </p><p>to Obasanjo\'s tenure as military Head of State from </p><p>1976-79.  Obasanjo shepherded the 1979 constitution </p><p>that introduced Nigeria to the presidential system. </p><p>The Ooni may have been guilty of hyperbole by saying </p><p>that Obasanjo represented America to most Nigerians; </p><p>however, there is an association in the public mind of </p><p>Obasanjo with the United States.  Many Nigerians </p><p>believe Obasanjo is "our man."  Moreover, Sijuwade </p><p>probably intended his characterization of Obasanjo to </p><p>convey to us that, among the major political figures, </p><p>Obasanjo is the one who most closely approaches </p><p>American ideals of priority and governance.  End </p><p>comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Ambassador Jeter told the Ooni that USG would </p><p>neither endorse nor oppose any  candidate -- that </p><p>decision was the exclusive preserve of the Nigerian </p><p>electorate.   Sijuwade responded that if the USG did </p><p>not back Obasanjo it would be complicit in Nigeria\'s </p><p>dismemberment.  "If not Obasanjo, who will rule </p><p>Nigeria? From where would he come?," the Ooni asked. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Sijuwade insisted the reports of a chasm </p><p>separating  Obasanjo from former Head of State </p><p>Babangida and VP Atiku were untrue.  The Ooni </p><p>unconvincingly referred to Babangida as Obasanjo\'s </p><p>"good boy" who still looked up to Obasanjo as his </p><p>superior as he did when they were in the military a </p><p>quarter century ago.  Also claiming a close personal </p><p>relationship with Babangida, Sijuwade stated he had </p><p>met Babangida recently, with Babangida indicating he </p><p>preferred Obasanjo to the other prospective </p><p>candidates.  Sijuwade predicted VP Atiku would not </p><p>challenge Obasanjo.  Atiku\'s greatest enemy was </p><p>Babangida who would actively block Atiku\'s run for the </p><p>presidency, Sijuwade stressed. In fact, the real </p><p>schism was between Atiku and Babangida, with Obasanjo </p><p>working assiduously to reconcile the two, according to </p><p>Sijuwade.  (Comment:  This rendition of Obasanjo as </p><p>mediating between Atiku and Babangida may have been </p><p>credible a year ago; however, the weight of current </p><p>information suggests that trust among the three is </p><p>minimal and none of the three can act as a referee for </p><p>the others.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Regarding former Head of State Mohammedu </p><p>Buhari, Sijuwade claimed Buhari "might wind up in jail </p><p>if he is not careful."  This was an allusion to recent </p><p>media coverage of an audit uncovering the loss of </p><p>millions of dollars during Buhari\'s tenure as head of </p><p>the Petroleum Trust Fund during the Abacha regime. </p><p>Moreover, Sijuwade declared that Buhari\'s candidacy </p><p>was doomed because no self- respecting Southerner </p><p>would vote for such a regional (Northern) and </p><p>religious (Moslem) chauvinist.  Sijuwade scoffed at </p><p>House Speaker Na\'Abba\'s presidential ambitions, </p><p>severely chiding the Speaker for overplaying his hand </p><p>by authoring the impeachment threat.  Sijuwade said </p><p>the Emir of Kano related to him a recent conversation </p><p>with Na\'Abba.  The Speaker confided to the Emir Bayero </p><p>that his major gripe was with the President\'s </p><p>frugality. "The President knows I need money," Na\'Abba </p><p>purportedly told the Emir, who, in turn, admonished </p><p>Na\'Abba for his venality. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.   (C) Criticism of Na\'Abba lead Sijuwade to </p><p>criticism of Northern politicians in general.  The </p><p>Ooni attacked the Northern elite as believing control </p><p>of national political power and the country\'s </p><p>pocketbook was their birthright.  Since Nigeria was </p><p>founded in 1914 by fusing South and North together for </p><p>the administrative convenience of the British Colonial </p><p>Office, the North has been surviving on resources and </p><p>money generated by the South.  Northerners erroneously </p><p>thought they could manipulate Obasanjo to allow their </p><p>continual access to the national treasury. However, </p><p>Obasanjo  tried to balance the equation by ending </p><p>business  as usual.  Now that access has been denied, </p><p>Northern carpetbaggers were angry.  Sijuwade </p><p>emphasized that Obasanjo\'s actions were justified. </p><p>Business as usual was wrecking the nation and causing </p><p>a small pool of the very rich to coexist beside an </p><p>expanding reservoir of desperately poor Nigerians. </p><p>This trend had to be checked  or, otherwise, it would </p><p>explode.  Only Obasanjo was up to the task of </p><p>remedying the inequity by keeping the greedy veteran </p><p>hands out of the vault, asserted the Ooni. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Because of his reformist policy, Obasanjo was </p><p>being served up by professional politicians as a </p><p>sacrificial lamb. For example, Sijuwade claimed, the </p><p>North feared Obasanjo\'s policy promoting national </p><p>identification cards because it would undermine the </p><p>purported numerical superiority upon which the North </p><p>bases its claim for political power. Sijuwade posited </p><p>Northern politicians were eager to shift the </p><p>presidency back to their region so they could have </p><p>unfettered access to government coffers once again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The Ooni declared Northern politicians were </p><p>making a serious strategic mistake in thinking they </p><p>could perpetuate a tight grip on national power.  The </p><p>South would no longer tolerate Northern dominance. </p><p>Sijuwade claimed that Yorubas were prepared to "stand </p><p>on their own" and that the Igbos had indicated they </p><p>would follow suit if the North tried to reassert </p><p>hegemony. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Differentiating between Northern traditional </p><p>leaders and politicians, Sijuwade claimed close </p><p>contact with Emir Bayero of Kano, whom he described as </p><p>an Obasanjo supporter.  He stated the Emir understood </p><p>both the centrifugal implications and the implications </p><p>for governmental reform of a power shift to the North </p><p>at this time.  Sijuwade added that Bayero had recently </p><p>apologized to Obasanjo for his role in persuading the </p><p>President to release Mohammed Abacha, the son of the </p><p>late military leader Sani Abacha.  Sijuwade said that </p><p>Bayero had realized too late he had been used but </p><p>unscrupulous politicians to gain Abacha\'s release so </p><p>that the family would not have to relinquish the 1.2 </p><p>billion dollars to the Federal Government. Instead , </p><p>those politicians had in mind using a portion of that </p><p>ill-gotten  money to fund efforts to unseat Obasanjo, </p><p>during or before the upcoming presidential race. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The Ooni stated that Emir Bayero, the Obi of </p><p>Onitsha (the most influential Igbo ruler) and he </p><p>conferred recently, with the outcome being supportive </p><p>of Obasanjo.  Sijuwade said that traditional rulers </p><p>were the strongest moderating force in politics today. </p><p>Despite the divisive misbehavior and waywardness of </p><p>the political class in general, Sijuwade stated that </p><p>Nigeria would likely stay united because of the </p><p>efforts of traditional leaders.  "Traditional rulers </p><p>own Nigeria," he concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Sijuwade\'s remarks must be viewed through a </p><p>decidely Yoruba, Southwestern prism. As spiritual </p><p>leader of this ancient group, Sijuwade takes seriously </p><p>his ability to divine what will unfold.  As a </p><p>traditional ruler of a group that generally has sat on </p><p>the losing side of contest for national power, he </p><p>cannot help but believe national power was destined to </p><p>rest with the Yoruba for a sustained period during his </p><p>reign as Ooni.  After a long dry spell of twenty years </p><p>between 1979 and 1999, he understandably believes the </p><p>Presidency should stay in the Southwest four more </p><p>years. Also, his personal interests are served by an </p><p>Obasanjo return to office. With a Yoruba President, </p><p>Sijuwade\'s strong status among the traditional rulers </p><p>becomes further enhanced and elevated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Still, Sijuwade has not survived this long by </p><p>being just the "spiritual guide" for the Yorubas.  He </p><p>is an astute politician who does his homework.  He </p><p>knows there is little downside to supporting Obasanjo </p><p>at this time, especially among the Yoruba. There are </p><p>no visible challenges to his reign as Ooni and there </p><p>is scant chance of the Yoruba rebelling against him </p><p>for backing Obasanjo, who ,if not highly popular, is </p><p>still one of their own and the only Yoruba to become </p><p>Head of State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) If Obasanjo wins, Sijuwade\'s status in the </p><p>Southwest will be enhanced which will help him check </p><p>the influence of socio-cultural groups like Afenifere. </p><p>Moreover, because the Ooni has staked out such a </p><p>public position, some Obasanjo opponents would view </p><p>his defection as a mortal blow to the President. </p><p>Sijuwade knows some of these foes will court him; they </p><p>also know that convincing Sijuwade to back off or do </p><p>less will come at a high price. While Sijuwade spoke </p><p>in near absolutes, there was the sense that he was </p><p>staking out a maximalist position from which he will </p><p>probe and negotiate as the electoral process unfolds. </p><p>(His call for USG to support Obasanjo should be viewed </p><p>in this light. What he knows about our position </p><p>regarding Obasanjo probably will be a factor the Ooni </p><p>will be weigh in determining how far and hard he </p><p>pushes for Obasanjo.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) The Ooni\'s warning on secession should not be </p><p>taken too seriously. However, it cannot be totally </p><p>dismissed.  The warning reflects the real and mounting </p><p>ethnic and regional tension that accompany the </p><p>oncoming election.  While Nigeria\'s disintegration is </p><p>unlikely, its political class must exercise extreme </p><p>caution to avoid missteps that could further divide a </p><p>sometimes already deeply divided nation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
