THE OCTOBER 21 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED </p><p>   WEEKLY "THE SUNDAY MAIL" CARRIED TWO OPINION PIECES </p><p>   FOCUSING ON THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE </p><p>   U.S. AND THE U.S.-LED STRIKE AGAINST TERROR IN </p><p>   AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>2.   UNDER HEADLINE "WHAT GOES ROUND COMES AROUND," THE </p><p>   NEWSPAPER RAN THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE BY SURE MATARAMVURA, </p><p>   A LECTURER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AT </p><p>   THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY </p><p>   (NUST): </p><p> </p><p>   "THE BOMBING OF THE WTC (WORLD TRADE CENTER) AND THE </p><p>   PENTAGON IN THE U.S. RECENTLY AND REACTION OF BOTH THE </p><p>   U.S. AS A NATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAVE </p><p>   LED ME TO CONCLUDE ONE THING; THAT HISTORY REPEATS </p><p>   ITSELF.  BEFORE I JUSTIFY MY REASONS TO SAY THIS, WE </p><p>   NEED TO LOOK AT THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF THIS TRAGEDY. </p><p>   I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN COMFORTABLE </p><p>   WITH THE PRESENT SITUATION WHERE ONE COUNTRY, THE U.S., </p><p>   BECOMES THE HEADMASTER, DEPUTY HEADMASTER AND SENIOR </p><p>   MASTER OF THE WORLD BY PRESENTING ITSELF AS THE CHIEF </p><p>   ARCHITECT OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRONOUNCING </p><p>   ON ANY NATION THAT WOULD HAVE FAILED TO CALL IT MASTER. </p><p>   . .THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN OBSERVING THE BEHAVIORS OF </p><p>   SUCCESSIVE U.S. ADMINISTRATIONS FROM THE SECOND WORLD </p><p>   WAR HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE U.S. </p><p>   WAS TO BUILD A U.S. EMPIRE. . .THOSE COUNTRIES WHO DARED </p><p>   BLOCK THIS OBJECTIVE WERE SUBJECTED TO THE U.S. MAIN </p><p>   WEAPON OF TORTURE: ECONOMIC SANCTIONS WHICH ARE </p><p>   SOMETIMES OPENLY ANNOUNCED THROUGH THE U.S. PARLIAMENT, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03158  01 OF 02  230821Z </p><p>   THE U.N. OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR COMPANIES SCATTERED </p><p>   ALL OVER THE WORLD.  THE OTHER WEAPON WAS/IS TO FUND </p><p>   TERRORISTS TO TOPPLE THOSE UNDESIRED GOVERNMENTS WHO </p><p>   CHALLENGE THE U.S. . .THE KEY ISSUE IS THAT AS A RESULT </p><p>   OF THE BOMBINGS IN WASHINGTON, INNOCENT PEOPLE DIED AND </p><p>   THAT THERE IS A SPONSOR TO THESE TERRORIST ATTACKS. </p><p>   WHETHER IT WAS BIN LADEN OR NOT IS NOT THE ISSUE, THE </p><p>   ISSUE IS THAT THERE IS A MAD MAN SOMEWHERE, JUST LIKE </p><p>   THE SUCCESSIVE U.S. ADMINISTRATIONS, WHO DOES NOT VALUE </p><p>   LIFE AND INSTEAD SPONSORS A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE </p><p>   HIS OBJECTIVE, OF CREATING AN EMPIRE, BE IT BIN LADEN </p><p>   EMPIRE OR A U.S. EMPIRE. . .TERRORISM DID NOT START WIN </p><p>   BIN LADEN.  ACTUALLY BIN LADEN WAS ONCE A TERRORIST ON </p><p>   THE CIA PAYROLL.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT BIN </p><p>   LADEN HAS TARGETED THE U.S. EMPIRE. . .THE IDEA OF </p><p>   EMPIRE CREATION SHOULD BE ABANDONED ONCE AND FOREVER. </p><p>   IT HAS NEVER SUCCEEDED AND IF IT CONTINUES, WILL BE THE </p><p>   BASIS OF A THIRD WORLD WAR, WHICH WILL OBVIOUSLY TARGET </p><p>   THE EMPERORS. . .ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM SHOULD BE </p><p>   INVESTIGATED AND DEALT WITH BY THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>   COMMUNITY.  THESE RANGE FROM BIOLOGICAL TERRORISM AND </p><p>   ECONOMIC TERRORISM TO MILITARY-STYLE TERRORISM. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>3.   UNDER HEADLINE "INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN WON\'T STOP </p><p>   TERRORISM," THE SAME NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED THE FOLLOWING </p><p>   PIECE BY BRIGADIER FELIX MUCHEMWA, A RETIRED ZIMBABWE </p><p>   NATIONAL ARMY OFFICER, A FORMER CABINET MINISTER IN THE </p><p>   ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT AND A PRACTICING MEDICAL DOCTOR: </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .

THAT IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE </p><p>   RESPONSE TO SUCH A CONFLICT, BUT THIS MIGHT STILL FAIL </p><p>   IF THE CAUSE OF WAR BY MOSLEM FUNDAMENTALISTS IS NOT </p><p>   CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD. . .THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TOTAL GRAND </p><p>   MILITARY STRATEGY AND THE GRAND ALLIANCE IS THE TOTAL </p><p>   ELIMINATION OF THE TALIBAN REGIME AND ITS BEDFELLOWS, </p><p>   THE AL QUEDA, THE CAPTURE OF AFGHANISTAN AND THE </p><p>   RECREATION OF A NEW REGIME FAVORABLE TO WESTERN POWERS. </p><p>   BIN LADEN, DEAD OR ALIVE, MUST BE CAPTURED. . .BUT </p><p>   AMERICA HAS SPELT OUT ITS GOAL IN THIS WAR - \'STOP </p><p>   TERRORISM.\'  WILL THE OBJECTIVE OF CAPTURING AFGHANISTAN </p><p>   ACHIEVE THIS GOAL?  THE ANSWER IS NO.  AL QUEDA IS NOW </p><p>   AN INTERNATIONAL WORLD FORCE READY TO HIT ANYWHERE.  IT </p><p>   HAS TOO MUCH MONEY, TOO MANY PROFESSIONALS AND </p><p>   TECHNOCRATS ON ITS PAYROLL TO PRODUCE EVEN A TACTICAL </p><p>   NUCLEAR WEAPON FOR ITS PURPOSE.  ABOVE ALL, THE MOSLEM </p><p>   WORLD\'S DEEP FEELINGS ARE ON THEIR SIDE.  THEIR MESSAGE </p><p>   IS SIMPLE - AMERICA IS SUPPORTING CORRUPT SHEIKS, </p><p>   PRINCES AND MILITARY DICTATORS IN THE MOSLEM WORLD, </p><p>   CAUSING MASSIVE SUFFERING OF MOSLEM PEOPLE.  ALL THE OIL </p><p>   DOLLARS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST ARE IN WESTERN-CONTROLLED </p><p>   BANKS ON MONEY LAUNDERING WITH THE GRACE OF AMERICA. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ6269 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03158  02 OF 02  230821Z </p><p>ACTION INR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   A-00     ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  LAB-01   VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  IRM-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  IIP-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------33C5CF  230821Z /38 </p><p>P 230750Z OCT 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0086 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p>AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LILONGWE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003158 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX, ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT, AF/P, INR/R/MR, </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OCII, ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT STRIKE AGAINST TERROR OPINION PIECES; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>   LASTLY, THEIR MESSAGE IS ON PALESTINE, GIVE PALESTINE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03158  02 OF 02  230821Z </p><p>   LAND, NOT DIPLOMATIC PROMISES.
