<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002819 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR NOVELLI/SAUMS </p><p>CUSTOMS FOR CRAIG WALKER, FARAH NAIM, LEON HAYWARD </p><p>USDOC/4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>OPIC FOR ABED TARBUSH </p><p>PASS EXIMBANK </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, JO, OPIC </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN ASKS FOR VIEWS ON FTA MEETINGS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 6. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Majed Hammoudeh, the director of the Foreign Trade </p><p>Policy Directorate at the Ministry of Industry and Trade </p><p>(MOIT), called to broach the subject of bilateral meetings </p><p>foreseen by the Free Trade Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Rules of Origin Committee </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  According to the FTA, an initial meeting of the </p><p>"Rules of Origin Committee" should be held within six months </p><p>of entry into force of the agreement, i.e. by June 17, 2002. </p><p>Hammoudeh said MOIT Minister Salah al-Bashir is inclined to </p><p>offer to host a meeting in Amman.  The Jordanian delegation </p><p>would be led by MOIT Secretary General Samer al-Tawil and </p><p>would include senior officials of the Customs Directorate. </p><p>In addition to broader rules of origin issues, the Jordanians </p><p>would like to use the meeting to enhance practical </p><p>cooperation between Jordanian and U.S. Customs.  (Septel will </p><p>provide more background on customs implementation issues that </p><p>have come up since December.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Joint Commission </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Al-Bashir is also inclined to propose that the </p><p>first annual meeting of the "Joint Commission" be held in </p><p>Amman during the month of September.  He would like to build </p><p>around the official meetings a major event (such as a </p><p>conference or seminar) highlighting bilateral trade and </p><p>investment opportunities.  He foresaw inviting U.S. </p><p>businesspeople, perhaps as a formal trade and investment </p><p>mission, to attend this event. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Comment and Action Request </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  In post\'s view, a meeting of the Joint Commission </p><p>could be effectively structured either in Washington or Amman </p><p>depending on the availability of the appropriate U.S. </p><p>officials.  We think it would be most useful to use a meeting </p><p>as a vehicle for public/private sector side events like the </p><p>one broached by al-Bashir.  If the Joint Commission were to </p><p>meet in the U.S., for example, various other Jordanians have </p><p>suggested using it as a hook for a high-level Jordanian trade </p><p>and investment mission.  In either case, a substantial amount </p><p>of preparation -- and hence lead-time -- would be needed on </p><p>the Jordanian side to make side events work.  We would </p><p>encourage participation in side events in Jordan or the </p><p>United States by U.S. agencies with trade and investment </p><p>mandates, including Commerce, State, Customs, EXIM, TDA and </p><p>OPIC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  As for the Rules of Origin meeting, we suspect </p><p>that it could be held on the margins of the Joint Committee </p><p>meeting (or by video conference if it is important to meet </p><p>before the June 17 date).  Hammoudeh suggested that the </p><p>format and timing of a meeting would depend on how difficult </p><p>or complex the agenda items would be. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Action Request:  Hammoudeh said MOIT would </p><p>appreciate informal guidance on how best to pursue these </p><p>issues with the U.S. government.  He said al-Bashir would </p><p>then be prepared to write to USTR or to the Ambassador with a </p><p>formal proposal.  Per the Jordanian request, we would </p><p>appreciate receiving, ideally before June 15, points that we </p><p>could use with Hammoudeh and the Minister. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
