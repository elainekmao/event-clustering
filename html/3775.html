The Ministry of Finance projects that the GDP will grow </p><p>by 2.5 percent in 2002 (most likely overstated) and that the </p><p>central government\'s fiscal deficit as a percent of GDP will </p><p>be 5.9 percent.  This is higher than the GOH\'s earlier </p><p>estimate of 5.6 percent of GDP and far higher than its </p><p>target in its IMF program.  The government is considering </p><p>further tax measures to increase government revenues. </p><p> </p><p>2.  In September, the Ministry of Finance presented the 2003 </p><p>budget proposal to the National Congress.  The central </p><p>government\'s budget of approximately 32.7 billion lempiras </p><p>(usd 1.97 billion) represents a 10 percent increase in </p><p>nominal terms over the 2002 levels.  Spending on health, </p><p>education and security account for 65 percent of the budget, </p><p>while debt service payments (including usd 100 million for </p><p>Paris Club debt) account for 17 percent.  With improvements </p><p>in tax receipts, the Ministry of Finance projects the </p><p>central government fiscal deficit could fall to four percent </p><p>of GDP; however, local economists are skeptical. </p><p> </p><p>Maquila Sector: New Investment </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Honduran Maquila Association (AHM) reports that the </p><p>industry is rebounding from losses incurred in 2001 and </p><p>estimates that the value added in 2002 will total usd 660 </p><p>million, an increase of usd 60 million over 2001 and equal </p><p>to 2000 levels.  Meanwhile, total employment in the sector </p><p>in 2002 is projected to average 110,000, the same as 2001 </p><p>but still lower than 2000 when the sector registered 125,000 </p><p>workers. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Local press reported that in October South Korean </p><p>company Woon Chun de Honduras will begin operation of an </p><p>apparel assembly plant employing approximately 1,100 </p><p>workers.  Total new investment is estimated to be over usd </p><p>30 million.  Meanwhile, Lear Corporation, a U.S. company </p><p>producing wire harnesses for U.S. automakers, announced </p><p>plans to increase investment by usd 10 million, generating </p><p>an estimated 1,500 new jobs. </p><p> </p><p>Remittances up by 38 Percent in 2002 </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  Remittances from abroad (primarily the U.S.) have become </p><p>the second largest source of national income, totaling usd </p><p>550 million in 2001, or 8.6 percent of GDP.  The Central </p><p>Bank announced that remittances in 2002 are increasing at a </p><p>rate of 38 percent compared to 2001 and could total nearly </p><p>usd 800 million by the end of the year.  According to the </p><p>Central Bank, an estimated usd 120 million is charged </p><p>annually by money transfer companies for transactions </p><p>between the U.S. and Honduras.  The Central Bank has plans </p><p>to institute a mechanism in late 2002 allowing people </p><p>residing in the U.S. to transfer money to Honduras via </p><p>selected corresponding banks.  The new system could reduce </p><p>transaction costs by 60 percent. </p><p> </p><p>Banking System: Two Banks Intervened, New Laws Passed </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Central Bank disbursed approximately usd 40 million </p><p>in May to intervene two undercapitalized banks, Banco </p><p>Capital and Banco Sogerin.  The money was given as a </p><p>supplementary credit to Honduras\' Deposit Insurance </p><p>Institution (Fosede) in order to guarantee 100 percent of </p><p>deposits.  The two banks account for usd 120.7 million in </p><p>deposits.  Since the intervention, the National Banking </p><p>Commission reported a six percent decline in Capital and </p><p>Sogerin deposits - much lower than the expected 15 percent. </p><p>Attorneys representing Sogerin and Capital appealed the </p><p>interventions to the Supreme Court. </p><p> </p><p>7.  In August, the National Congress approved a law </p><p>extending the 100 percent government deposit insurance until </p><p>September 30, 2003.  At that point deposit insurance will be </p><p>capped at 150,000 lempiras (usd 9,000). </p><p> </p><p>8.  The National Congress approved a law in August </p><p>tightening rules regulating related lending and investment </p><p>by banks.  According to the law, the cap on loans to related </p><p>entities will decline from the current limit of 120 percent </p><p>of the institution\'s capital to 30 percent over a three-year </p><p>period.  Per the law, banks are also limited from investing </p><p>more than 20 percent of their total capital in any one </p><p>particular outside business. </p><p> </p><p>New Honduran Airline Commences Operations </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Sol Air, the first Honduran airline to operate in nearly </p><p>a decade, began operations on July 12 with two daily flights </p><p>to Miami and an opening roundtrip fare of usd 399.00.  From </p><p>Miami, Sol Air offers service to Tegucigalpa and San Pedro </p><p>Sula.  TACA and American have responded to the new </p><p>competition with deeply discounted fares over the summer and </p><p>early fall.  In November, the airline hopes to begin direct </p><p>flights from Dallas to Roatan on Saturdays, serving </p><p>primarily tourists interested in scuba diving and other </p><p>island tourism.  The company also hopes to fly to New </p><p>Orleans (and on to Costa Rica), a routing pushed heavily by </p><p>the Mayor of the city of New Orleans during his early July </p><p>visit.  Permits to fly to San Salvador and Managua are still </p><p>pending. </p><p> </p><p>InterAirports Under Attack, Although Issue is Quiet for Now </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  After a series of media attacks and complaints by </p><p>private sector groups, Congress named a special commission </p><p>in July to investigate InterAirports for possible breach of </p><p>contract.  The U.S.-led Interairports consortium (51 percent </p><p>U.S. owned) took management control of Honduras\' four </p><p>international airports in October 2000.  Critics charge that </p><p>the San Francisco Airport Authority is not an active, full </p><p>partner in the consortium (participation of a major airport </p><p>was a requirement in the public tender and subsequent </p><p>contract) and that the company has not followed through with </p><p>investments.  They have also been criticized for fee </p><p>increases.  InterAirports counters that the price increases </p><p>were enacted by the National Congress and that fees for air </p><p>cargo are still the lowest in the region.  In addition, </p><p>delays in contract-mandated investments, such as extending </p><p>the runway at the Tegucigalpa airport, are the result of </p><p>government delays and inaction.  President Maduro and other </p><p>government officials have publicly stated that Interairports </p><p>has complied with the terms of the contract. </p><p> </p><p>11.  InterAirports\' figures reveal that between October 2000 </p><p>and May 2002, the company has invested usd 24.8 million in </p><p>the four international airports.  Interairports is planning </p><p>to invest an additional usd 26.3 million in the airports </p><p>over the next year.  Planned projects include building a new </p><p>hangar in Tegucigalpa and renovating and expanding the </p><p>terminal at the La Ceiba airport. </p><p> </p><p>Administrative Simplification Law Passed </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  In August, the National Congress approved the </p><p>Administrative Simplification Law which reduces the </p><p>bureaucratic hurdles in establishing a business in Honduras. </p><p>The law, which was drafted by the Competitiveness Council, </p><p>is part of the government\'s plan to make Honduras a more </p><p>attractive place for foreign investment.  Some of the </p><p>benefits of the law include simplifying procedures involved </p><p>in establishing a new business and placing time limits on </p><p>issuing government permits. </p><p> </p><p>Prequalification Process for Cellular Contract Underway </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  On September 9, Honduras\' telecommunications regulatory </p><p>agency (CONATEL) held an open pre-qualification process for </p><p>companies planning to bid on the Honduran cellular service </p><p>contract.  Two U.S. companies, Bell South Honduras and </p><p>Digicel Honduras (U.S. partners with Salvadoran and Italian </p><p>investment) participated.  Other potential contenders </p><p>include Telmex, TelGuat, Entel Chile and Megatel (Honduran). </p><p>Conatel will officially announce which companies qualify by </p><p>October 8, 2002.  The final bid opening is forecast for </p><p>sometime in January 2003.  There is currently one cellular </p><p>service provider in Honduras, U.S. led consortium Celtel. </p><p>(See ref a for more on the prequalification process.) </p><p> </p><p>Energy Sector Update: ENEE Opens Bids for 210 MW Contract </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  The National Electric Company (ENEE) opened bids on </p><p>July 26 for a 210 MW contract to begin in 2004.  AES is the </p><p>only U.S. competitor along with five other major energy </p><p>companies including local investors.  AES and national </p><p>thermal energy producer Lufussa submitted the lowest bids </p><p>(just over usd 0.05 per KWH).  AES has plans to build a usd </p><p>650 million 750 MW liquid natural gas-fired power plant in </p><p>Puerto Cortes. (See ref b for more on the bid.) </p><p> </p><p>15.  In response to environmental concerns voiced by local </p><p>environmental groups and government authorities, local </p><p>energy company HydroHonduras revamped plans to build a </p><p>hydroelectric project on the Cangrejal River near La Ceiba. </p><p>The new design reduces the planned capacity from 50 MW to 40 </p><p>MW and reduces total investment to usd 71 million.  U.S. </p><p>energy company Alaska Power and Telephone reportedly has a </p><p>32 percent share of the project.  The Cangrejal river forms </p><p>the eastern boundary of Pico Bonito, Honduras\' second </p><p>largest national park.  Proponents of tourism in the area </p><p>are concerned that the plan to build an 11 km. diversion </p><p>canal will effectively end white water rafting on the </p><p>Cangrejal and thus jeopardize efforts to attract additional </p><p>tourism to nearby La Ceiba. </p><p> </p><p>Coffee Export Revenues Increase Slightly </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  According to the Honduran Coffee Institute (Ihcafe), </p><p>coffee export revenues for the 2001-2002 coffee harvest </p><p>totaled approximately usd 179 million, an increase of usd 10 </p><p>million compared to the 2000-2001 harvest.  Honduras </p><p>exported an estimated 3.5 million quintals (1 quintal = 100 </p><p>lbs.) during the 2001-2002, an increase of 300,000 quintals </p><p>compared to the 2000-2001 season. </p><p> </p><p>17.  In response to the dismal international market for </p><p>coffee, hundreds of small coffee farmers demonstrated in </p><p>Tegucigalpa in August.  The demonstrators demanded financial </p><p>assistance to help defray losses suffered during this year\'s </p><p>coffee harvest.  Maduro, bowing somewhat to pressure, agreed </p><p>to have the state banks small producers 100 lempira (about </p><p>usd six) loans per quintal produced up to 100 quintals.  The </p><p>15-year loans have a three-year grace period. </p><p> </p><p>Chiquita Resumes Banana Production After Strike </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>18.  Chiquita\'s 2,200 employees returned to work following </p><p>the resolution of a nine-day strike during May.  Union </p><p>leaders took issue with Chiquita\'s use of pesticide-treated </p><p>bags to combat the cochinilla insect.  Chiquita reports that </p><p>the cochinilla insect affects 30% of the crop.  Union </p><p>leaders also presented a list of demands regarding job </p><p>security, salary and medical care.  Workers returned to work </p><p>after an international scientific commission certified that </p><p>Chiquita\'s pesticides are safe.  Chiquita has publicly </p><p>stated that, in light of the strike, high absenteeism and </p><p>low productivity rates, it is considering reducing its </p><p>presence in Honduras and selling some of its farms to </p><p>independent producers. </p><p> </p><p>Mangos Exported to the U.S. for the First Time </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>19.  A USDA-built hot water treatment plant for mangos began </p><p>operating in April, permitting Honduran mango producers for </p><p>the first time to meet U.S. med-fly phytosanitary </p><p>requirements.  A total of 18 containers were exported during </p><p>April and May at a value of approximately usd 500,000. </p><p>Reportedly 45 percent of the fruit brought to the plant for </p><p>treatment was rejected, primarily for being undersized, </p><p>damaged during shipment or for being too ripe.  Between 700 </p><p>and 800 hundred hectares of mango are cultivated in the </p><p>Comayagua valley in central Honduras.  Honduras is projected </p><p>to export approximately 30 containers of mangos in 2003 </p><p>worth nearly usd two million.  Legislation creating the </p><p>cooperative (which will own and manage the facility) has </p><p>been moving slowly through Congress.  The GOH is looking </p><p>into ways to use the plant during other times of the year, </p><p>for papaya and other fruits. </p><p> </p><p>USG Donates Equipment to Benefit Small Dairy Farmers </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  In May, 12 dairy farmer cooperatives were given the </p><p>titles to dairy refrigeration tanks valued at over usd </p><p>300,000.  The tanks were donated by the USG as a result of </p><p>cooperation between USAID and the U.S. firm Land O\'Lakes. </p><p>USAID will provide another usd 5.5 million in technical </p><p>assistance, training and equipment with the goal of </p><p>modernizing Honduras\' dairy sector.  Nearly 500,000 </p><p>Hondurans rely upon the dairy sector for their livelihood. </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
