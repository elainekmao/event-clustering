<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000701 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: SERBIA; IRAQ; NORTH KOREA </p><p> </p><p>SERBIA </p><p>1.   "A murder in Serbia" </p><p>The leading Globe and Mail stressed (3/13): "...We hope </p><p>the world sees this [assassination of reformist Prime </p><p>Minister Zoran Djindjicas] more than just another in a </p><p>line of troubles that have historically made the </p><p>Balkans a powder keg. We hope its concern is for the </p><p>country as it is today, for the reforms and </p><p>constitutional rule taking shape, and the well-being of </p><p>its people." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Serbia\'s reformer, R.I.P." </p><p>The conservative National Post opined (3/13): "...Mr. </p><p>Djindjic was a controversial politician who often had </p><p>bitter disagreements with his own democratic-minded </p><p>colleagues. But he will no doubt be remembered as a </p><p>democratic hero. The best way for Serbians to avenge </p><p>his death is to continue with Mr. Djindjic\'s political </p><p>reforms and anti-crime crusade. As Mr. Djindjic himself </p><p>noted in a tragically prescient interview following a </p><p>botched assassination attempt against him last month, </p><p>the death of the reformer need not necessarily spell </p><p>the death of his reforms." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "Serbia\'s loss" </p><p>The nationalist Ottawa Citizen declared (3/13): </p><p>"...Bringing lasting peace to the Balkans was already </p><p>difficult. Mr. Djindjic\'s death makes it even harder." </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>4.   "We should sit out this war" </p><p>Under the sub-heading, "U.S. credibility on Iraq has </p><p>eroded to an extent that it is becoming hard to believe </p><p>anything from the Bush administration," </p><p>editorial page editor Haroon Siddiqui commented in the </p><p>liberal Toronto Star (3/13): "...The Bush </p><p>administration\'s staggering dishonesty can best be seen </p><p>in the number of times the U.N. inspectors have had to </p><p>shoot down its unsubstantiated assertions. Both Hans </p><p>Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei are seasoned international </p><p>civil servants who understand the value of non- </p><p>partisanship. But they felt compelled to set the record </p><p>straight. </p><p>First, Blix: </p><p>No, his inspectors were not spied on. No, the Iraqis </p><p>could not have had advance knowledge of the sites to be </p><p>inspected. </p><p>No, he did not think Iraqi agents were posing as </p><p>scientists, or that real scientists were being whisked </p><p>out of the country to avoid interrogations. </p><p>No, he found no evidence of Iraqis hiding or moving </p><p>banned materials in or out of the country. </p><p>No, he did not believe that Iraq had cleaned up some </p><p>sites before inspections, as Colin Powell alleged, </p><p>using before and after satellite pictures that Blix </p><p>exposed as having been taken `several weeks apart.\' </p><p>No, the trucks that Powell identified as mobile labs </p><p>producing biological weapons were not in the germ </p><p>warfare business; they were carrying food-tasting and </p><p>seed-processing equipment. </p><p>No, Iraq had not hidden the long-range missiles that </p><p>the inspectors ordered destroyed: `These weapons were </p><p>declared; they were not clandestine.\' </p><p>No, he found no evidence that Iraq was producing and </p><p>storing chemical or biological weapons in underground </p><p>bunkers. </p><p>No, he saw no persuasive evidence of Iraqi links to Al </p><p>Qaeda. \'There are other states where there appear to be </p><p>stronger links.\' </p><p>Now, ElBaradei: </p><p>No, there was no uranium bought from Niger. Documents </p><p>purporting to show that were forged. </p><p>No, the International Atomic Energy Agency found no </p><p>evidence that high-strength aluminium tubes were </p><p>imported for uranium enrichment. Even if they were, it </p><p>was unlikely that Iraq had the capacity to redesign </p><p>them for such usage. </p><p>No, there is no evidence of Iraq using imported high- </p><p>strength magnets in its nuclear program. </p><p>No, there is no evidence of a resumption of \'prohibited </p><p>nuclear or nuclear-related activities.\' </p><p>Despite being contradicted on so many fronts, Powell is </p><p>now saying with a straight face that he has \'new </p><p>information\' that Iraq is building new missiles as the </p><p>inspectors are destroying the old ones. That\'s quite </p><p>possible. But does anyone believe him, or America, any </p><p>more? The evaporation of American credibility is a </p><p>tragedy whose effects may outlast the war." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "Bush\'s so-called rush into battle is anything </p><p>but" </p><p>Columnist Marcus Gee observed in the leading Globe and </p><p>Mail (3/13): "- Rush to war? It has been 18 months </p><p>since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 14 months since U.S. </p><p>President George W. Bush gave his speech naming Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s Iraq part of an \'axis of evil,\' six months </p><p>since he took his case to the United Nations and four </p><p>months since he secured a UN resolution giving Iraq </p><p>a final chance to give up its weapons of mass </p><p>destruction. If this is a rush, it\'s hard to imagine </p><p>what a crawl would look like.... Whether or not all the </p><p>diplomacy succeeds, no one can say that the United </p><p>States didn\'t go the last mile to get international </p><p>support. Far from plunging into war, Mr. Bush has </p><p>proceeded by careful, deliberate steps.... And if Mr. </p><p>Bush doesn\'t get the UN majority and goes to war </p><p>anyway? Well, at least no one can call it a \'rush to </p><p>war.\'" </p><p> </p><p>NORTH KOREA </p><p>6.   "North Korea shows how to make the U.S. temper its </p><p>actions" </p><p>Columnist Jonathan Manthorpe wrote in the left-of- </p><p>center Vancouver Sun (3/12): "...Because Kim is a real </p><p>military threat and has neighbours - China, Japan and </p><p>South Korea - of importance to the U.S., Washington has </p><p>chosen to negotiate rather than attack. Saddam, on the </p><p>other hand, has no nuclear weapons and might or might </p><p>not be able to account for biological and </p><p>chemical weapons stocks he might or might not have </p><p>had.... Once you have nuclear weapons Washington will </p><p>treat you with caution. So better get the bomb </p><p>quick.... So the way the U.S. administration has </p><p>handled the Iraq-North Korea dichotomy can be seen as </p><p>promoting weapons proliferation rather than containing </p><p>it.... It\'s not necessary to be on Washington\'s hit </p><p>list to feel that in an increasingly uncertain world </p><p>having a nice fat bomb stored in the basement might be </p><p>a good idea.... An arms race in Asia is, of course, </p><p>most likely to happen if Washington\'s allies feel the </p><p>U.S. cannot be depended upon to support its friends as </p><p>it has for the last half century. That development </p><p>seems unlikely now, but who can tell what mood America </p><p>will be in after its Iraqi adventure? Even without a </p><p>spate of proliferation in Asia, the situation between </p><p>the U.S. and North Korea is dangerous enough.... What </p><p>Washington does not seem to have grasped with </p><p>sufficient clarity is that Kim\'s North Korean regime is </p><p>not house-trained. More than half a century of self- </p><p>imposed isolation has bred institutional suspicion, </p><p>paranoia and sheer ignorance about how the world works. </p><p>Kim\'s paranoia roared forth when Bush declared a </p><p>strategy of \'pre-emptive attack\' on any country deemed </p><p>a future risk to America. Washington discovered Kim\'s </p><p>secret nuclear research last year, confirming its view </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>that he could not be trusted." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
