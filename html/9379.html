The </p><p>Americans were forced to withdraw their accusations </p><p>against Turkish special forces in the region, including </p><p>the allegation of an assassination attempt against </p><p>Kirkuk\'s Kurdish governor.  General Sylvester came back </p><p>to Ankara on Sunday, and meetings of the joint </p><p>commission resumed.  A joint statement by the </p><p>commission is expected on Monday.  The American </p><p>delegation is awaiting Washington\'s approval to release </p><p>the statement, dailies report.  General Sylvester has </p><p>admitted that the methods used by U.S. soldiers in </p><p>detaining the Turks were wrong.  The U.S. side is to </p><p>launch an investigation against its troops involved in </p><p>the raid.  Papers also say that President Sezer will </p><p>send a letter on the issue to President Bush via U.S. </p><p>Ambassador Robert Pearson.  Sezer\'s letter will </p><p>denounce the mistreatment of Turkish troops.  Prime </p><p>Minister Erdogan said that the U.S. side had fulfilled </p><p>all promises made by Vice President Cheney following </p><p>the arrests.  Meanwhile, papers write that Ankara, </p><p>believing Talabani to be behind the Suleymaniye </p><p>incident, has refused to renew the PUK leader\'s Turkish </p><p>passport. </p><p>General Abizaid due to Turkey: The new CENTCOM </p><p>Chairman, General John Abizaid, will stop over in </p><p>Turkey on his way to Qatar later this week, "Sabah" </p><p>reports.  General Abizaid will extend an `olive branch\' </p><p>to Ankara to repair the strain over the Suleymaniye </p><p>arrests.  The paper quotes an official from the U.S. </p><p>Administration as saying that the Abizaid visit could </p><p>open a new chapter in bilateral relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan conveys Bush message to Assad: Prime Minister </p><p>Erdogan conveyed a message by President Bush to Syrian </p><p>President Assad in a telephone conversation on Friday. </p><p>Erdogan reportedly urged Syria to make a reliable and </p><p>convincing effort to combat terrorism.  Assad promised </p><p>decisive action in the fight against terror, and said </p><p>that the Syrian prime minister would visit Turkey on </p><p>July 28 to discuss the matter in detail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Washington Institute report on Turkey: Saturday\'s </p><p>"Hurriyet" carries excerpts of a report by the </p><p>Washington Institute (WI) drawing attention to rising </p><p>anti-American sentiment in Turkey.  The report urges </p><p>Ankara to work together with the U.S. to eliminate the </p><p>PKK/KADEK presence in Northern Iraq.  Ankara should see </p><p>the Iraqi Kurds as part of the `Turkish family,\' the </p><p>report argues.  WI also warns that Congressional </p><p>approval of a resolution on the Armenian genocide would </p><p>worsen ties with Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: In a letter to the UN, Turkish Cypriot leader </p><p>Denktas offered a new package of confidence-building </p><p>measures.  Denktas suggests that both Turkish and Greek </p><p>Cypriots should use the abandoned town of Varosha and </p><p>have access to the international airport in Nicosia. </p><p>In exchange, Greek Cypriot vessels and planes will be </p><p>given access to Turkish harbors and airports, and </p><p>Turkey will launch free trade activities with the Greek </p><p>Cypriots.  Papers believe that the Greek Cypriot side </p><p>is unlikely to abandon the UN-sponsored peace plan, </p><p>which has firm EU backing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: US-Turkish Relations/Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Day After" </p><p>Asli Aydintasbas wrote in mass appeal Sabah (7/14): </p><p>"The Suleymaniye crisis stemmed largely from US </p><p>commanders in CENTCOM acting on their own initiative. </p><p>This is not the first crisis between the Turkish </p><p>military and CENTCOM.  There is ongoing mistrust on </p><p>both sides.  However, the high-ranking military and </p><p>political authorities on both the Turkish and American </p><p>sides are working assiduously to find a settlement to </p><p>the crisis.  On the US side, very important names </p><p>including Cheney, Wolfowitz and Powell consider the US </p><p>action in Suleymaniye to be a mistake, and take </p><p>Turkey\'s objections as justifiable arguments.  Of </p><p>course, they don\'t make these views public.  In fact, </p><p>the parameters of Turkish-American relations have </p><p>changed in post-war Iraq.  Turkey has lost its position </p><p>as indispensable for the US.  The new parameters will </p><p>be developed based on the level of cooperation on the </p><p>Iraq issue." </p><p>"The Wings of Pentagon and Turkey" </p><p>Ali Aslan wrote from Washington in the Islamist- </p><p>intellectual Zaman (7/14): "It is obvious that the </p><p>Pentagon was by-passed in the Suleymaniye incident. </p><p>There are two wings at the Pentagon -- the civilian </p><p>wing and the military wing. . Leaders of the military </p><p>wing are so upset with Turkey because of the its </p><p>rejection of US troop deployments that they don\'t even </p><p>want to hear Turkey\'s name mentioned.  This sentiment </p><p>will likely continue for at least another 5 to 10 </p><p>years. . The civilian wing, on the other hand, is under </p><p>the control of the `neo-conservatives.\'  They seem to </p><p>be willing to move on with Turkey and put their </p><p>disappointment behind them.  Their overall attitude </p><p>about Turkey coincides with the State Department\'s </p><p>moderate approach.  . Both wings of the Pentagon have </p><p>something in common: They both want to see the Iraqi </p><p>Kurds have more influence and more representation -- </p><p>not only in the north, but throughout Iraq.  They would </p><p>like to keep Turkey out of northern Iraq to the extent </p><p>possible as long as Turkey resists the US vision for </p><p>the Kurds.  The neo-cons, however, do not approve of </p><p>the way the Turkish soldiers were treated in the </p><p>Suleymaniye incident.  So in this particular event, it </p><p>is the military wing of the Pentagon that should to be </p><p>blamed." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
