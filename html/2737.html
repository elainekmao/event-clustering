<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 MUSCAT 000730 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S, P, P/M, NEA, NEA/ARP, INR-MNIEHAUS </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCENTCOM FOR POLAD AND CCJ2 </p><p>SECDEF FOR OSD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MEPN, MU, XF </p><p>SUBJECT: BIN ALAWI ANGRY, FRUSTRATED BY U.S. "BIAS" TOWARDS </p><p>ISRAEL, SAYS ARABS WILL REFUSE TO CONDEMN SUICIDE BOMBING; </p><p>SAUDI PEACE PLAN "ONLY WAY FORWARD" </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 67796 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON CHIEF WILLIAM R. STEWART FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  OMANI MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS BIN ALAWI STRONGLY CRITICIZES U.S. POLICY IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST AND COMPLAINS THAT U.S. IS "COMPLETELY BIASED" </p><p>TOWARDS ISRAEL.  BIN ALAWI SAYS THAT IT IS "IMPOSSIBLE" NOW </p><p>FOR ARAB LEADERS TO CONDEMN SUICIDE BOMBING, WHICH THEY SEE </p><p>NOT ONLY AS LEGITIMATE SELF-DEFENSE FOR THE PALESTINIANS BUT </p><p>THE ONLY WAY THEY HAVE TO "FIGHT BACK" AGAINST "ISRAELI </p><p>ATROCITIES."  BIN ALAWI BLAMES THE U.S. FOR THE CURRENT </p><p>DEPLORABLE SITUATION, SAYING THAT AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>FAVORS ONLY THE ISRAELIS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE ARABS.  BIN </p><p>ALAWI SAYS THAT THE SAUDI PEACE PROPOSAL ENDORSED AT THE </p><p>BEIRUT ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT IS "THE ONLY WAY FORWARD" TOWARD </p><p>PEACE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES MET MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS YUSUF BIN ALAWI ON APRIL 10 TO DELIVER REFTEL </p><p>TALKING POINTS (MFA ARABIAN AFFAIRS CHIEF AMBASSADOR AHMAD </p><p>AL-HARTHI AND POL/E CHIEF ATTENDED AS NOTETAKERS).  AFTER </p><p>GLANCING AT THE POINTS, BIN ALAWI SAID THAT "THESE SIMPLY </p><p>FOLLOW THE STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE IN THE </p><p>MEDIA."  THE CHARGE SAID THAT THE POINTS GO BEYOND PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS.  THE UNITED STATES IS ASKING FOR THE HELP OF ARAB </p><p>GOVERNMENTS TO PRESSURE ARAFAT TO DENOUNCE SUICIDE BOMBINGS </p><p>AND TO RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS.  THE CHARGE EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>THE UNITED STATES IS SINCERE AND GENUINE IN ITS EFFORTS AND </p><p>UNDERSCORED OUR COMMITMENT TO GETTING BOTH THE SECURITY AND </p><p>POLITICAL PROCESSES BACK ON TRACK.  THE CHARGE NOTED THAT </p><p>GENERAL ZINNI HAD MET WITH YASER ARAFAT AND WAS LAYING THE </p><p>GROUNDWORK FOR BEGINNING A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE. THE FOCUS </p><p>NOW, SAID THE CHARGE, IS ON SECRETARY POWELL\'S VISIT TO </p><p>JERUSALEM BEGINNING TOMORROW. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) BIN ALAWI SAID THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THESE POINTS, WHICH </p><p>HAD BEEN MADE BEFORE. "BUT THEY ARE ONLY WISHES."  WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS "LOST ITS DIRECTION."  THE UNITED </p><p>STATES PUTS "ALL THE BLAME" ON ARAFAT.  HE IS THE ONLY ONE TO </p><p>BE BLAMED, NO MATTER WHAT THE REALITY.  THE UNITED STATES HAS </p><p>BEEN MAKING MISTAKES ALL ALONG AND NOW IS MAKING "AN EVEN </p><p>BIGGER MISTAKE."  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS TIME FOR THE </p><p>UNITED STATES, SAID BIN ALAWI.  YOU ASK ARAB LEADERS TO </p><p>CONDEMN HAMAS AND OTHER GROUPS FOR VIOLENCE. "BUT THIS WILL </p><p>NOT HAPPEN."  INSTEAD, HE SAID, ALL YOU WILL GET ARE "FURTHER </p><p>CONFRONTATIONS" WITH ARAB LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE CHARGE PUSHED BACK, REITERATING THE U.S. DESIRE </p><p>FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR </p><p>1402.  WE NEED TO GET THE ELEMENTS OF A POLITICAL PROCESS </p><p>UNDERWAY ONCE AGAIN, SAID THE CHARGE.  GENERAL ZINNI HAS </p><p>ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED MUCH BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES, AND WHEN </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL COMES HE WILL ENCOURAGE BOTH SIDES TO </p><p>DECLARE A CEASEFIRE AND THEN MOVE IMMEDIATELY TO BEGIN A </p><p>POLITICAL PROCESS.  THE KEY, SAID THE CHARGE, IS FOR FRIENDLY </p><p>ARAB GOVERNMENTS TO REINFORCE OUR MESSAGE TO THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>AUTHORITY AND TO ASK ARAFAT TO SUPPORT THE CEASEFIRE AND </p><p>ISSUE A STRONG STATEMENT AGAINST TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SHAKING HIS HEAD, BIN ALAWI SAID "YOU ARE CRACKING </p><p>ALL YOUR RESOURCES IN THE ARAB WORLD."  THE ISRAELIS ARE </p><p>"DESTROYING EVERYTHING," AND YOU WANT ARAB LEADERS TO ISSUE </p><p>STATEMENTS "AGAINST HAMAS, AGAINST PALESTINIANS." "IS THIS </p><p>LOGICAL?"  YOU HAVE LOST DIRECTION, REPEATED BIN ALAWI. </p><p>REMEMBER, SAID BIN ALAWI, THE MITCHELL REPORT WAS YOUR </p><p>PROPOSAL.  THE PALESTINIANS AGREED.  THE PALESTINIANS ARE </p><p>WILLING TO IMPLEMENT IT.  THEN CAME TENET.  AGAIN THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS AGREED.  BUT INSTEAD OF IMPLEMENTING IT, YOU </p><p>(THE U.S.) "SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING BECAUSE THE ISRAELIS </p><p>WON\'T ACCEPT IT."  INSTEAD, YOU SENT ZINNI TO THE REGION TO </p><p>DESIGN "YET ANOTHER PROCESS."  ONLY THIS TIME, THE PROCESS IS </p><p>TAILORED TO MEET ONLY ISRAEL\'S DESIRES. BUT NOW, THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS WON\'T AGREE TO IT, BECAUSE "IT IS NOT FAIR." </p><p>"WE KNOW THAT ISRAEL REFUSED 14 POINTS IN THE TENET PLAN. </p><p>YOU AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE THE DIGNITY TO FIGHT FOR YOUR </p><p>PROPOSAL.  AFTER ALL, YOU PUT IT FORWARD.  BUT INSTEAD, YOU </p><p>CHOOSE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE POOR PALESTINIANS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE CHARGE REPLIED BY NOTING THAT MISTAKES HAVE BEEN </p><p>MADE BY BOTH SIDES.  NO, INTERJECTED BIN ALAWI, "NOT BY BOTH </p><p>SIDES."  THE ISRAELIS AND THE ISRAELIS ALONE HAVE REJECTED </p><p>ALL THE PROPOSALS THE U.S. HAS PUT FORWARD, HE SAID.  THEY </p><p>HAVE BEEN THE STUMBLING BLOCK, NOT THE PALESTINIANS.  THE </p><p>CHARGE SAID THAT THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED, AND NOW THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS INSISTED ON THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1402.  WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT </p><p>MAKE, REJOINED BIN ALAWI.  ISRAEL REFUSES TO IMPLEMENT 1402. </p><p>HOW CAN THE U.S. DEFEND ISRAEL FOR ITS WRONGDOING?  YOU HAVE </p><p>NOW CREATED A SITUATION, CONTINUED BIN ALAWI, WHERE "THERE IS </p><p>NO HAMAS, THERE IS ONLY THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE."  "YOU ARE </p><p>GOING DOWNHILL."  I AM SPEAKING TO YOU FRANKLY, SAID BIN </p><p>ALAWI.  I AM GIVING YOU ADVICE AS A FRIEND MUST.  WE FEEL </p><p>SORRY FOR OUR FRIENDS IN WASHINGTON. UNFORTUNATELY, ALL YOU </p><p>HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DOING IS TO PUT EVERYONE IN THE REGION IN </p><p>"A VERY AWKWARD POSITION." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE CHARGE SAID THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO DRAW </p><p>THE LINE AT SUICIDE BOMBINGS.  THE U.S. NEEDED THE SUPPORT OF </p><p>ITS ARAB FRIENDS TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE PALESTINIANS TO ISSUE </p><p>A CLEAR CONDEMNATION OF SUICIDE BOMBINGS OF INNOCENT </p><p>ISRAELIS.  "THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN," SAID BIN ALAWI. </p><p>YOU CANNOT ASK ARAB LEADERS TO CONDEMN PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE </p><p>WHEN THEY HAVE "NO OTHER WAY TO FIGHT BACK."  "WHY DO YOU </p><p>ONLY CONDEMN THE PALESTINIAN?" CONTINUED BIN ALAWI.  WHY DO </p><p>YOU NOT CONDEMN ISRAELI ATROCITIES?  WE BLAME THE U.S. FOR </p><p>NOT HAVING PUT OBSERVERS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS NEED PROTECTION JUST AS MUCH AS ISRAELIS DO. </p><p>THE ARABS HAVE ASKED REPEATEDLY FOR U.S. OBSERVERS, BUT THERE </p><p>HAS BEEN "NO RESPONSE" FROM THE U.S.  WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT </p><p>THE US WANTS ONLY FOR THE PALESTINIANS "TO SURRENDER TO </p><p>ISRAEL."  "THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN."  THE ISRAELIS WANT </p><p>THE RIGHT TO INVADE THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AT ANY TIME, AND </p><p>ARREST ANYONE THEY WANT FOR ANY REASON. "IS THIS FAIR?" </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE CHARGE REPEATED THAT THE U.S. HAS ASKED ISRAEL TO </p><p>WITHDRAW FROM THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES.  YES, SAID BIN </p><p>ALAWI, AND THAT IS A GOOD THING.  BUT YOU STILL DO NOT </p><p>CONDEMN ISRAELI AGGRESSION. YOU ONLY CONDEMN THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  YOU AMERICANS CANNOT AVOID BLAME FOR THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION,.  YOU TOOK THE RESPONSIBILITY FROM 1993 -- </p><p>YOU PUSHED THE MADRID PROCESS FORWARD.  YOU SOUGHT AND </p><p>OBTAINED THE SUPPORT OF THE ARABS.  AND YET NOW YOU ONLY TAKE </p><p>ONE SIDE.  THIS WAS NOT THE CASE UNDER THE PREVIOUS TWO </p><p>ADMINISTRATIONS -- THEN YOU WERE "BASICALLY FAIR."  BUT THE </p><p>POLICIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE LED TO THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION.  "THERE IS NO PEACE PROCESS." </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  THE CHARGE STRESSED THAT THE U.S. IS GENUINELY </p><p>COMMITTED TO TRYING TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR A CEASEFIRE TO </p><p>TAKE HOLD, FOLLOWED BY A POLITICAL PROCESS AND PEACE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  IN ORDER TO DO THIS, THE U.S. SEEKS THE </p><p>ASSISTANCE OF THE ARABS TO PRESSURE THE PALESTINIANS TO DO </p><p>WHATEVER THEY CAN TO PREVENT FUTURE SUICIDE BOMBINGS.  FINE, </p><p>RESPONDED BIN ALAWI.  BUT WHAT WILL THE U.S. DO IN RETURN? </p><p>"WHAT WILL YOU DO TO THE ISRAELIS?  THEY DESTROY EVERYTHING. </p><p>THEY ARE THE AGGRESSORS.  THE WHOLE WORLD CAN SEE THE </p><p>ISRAELIS DESTROYING MOSQUES AND CHURCHES AND HOSPITALS AND </p><p>SCHOOLS.  WHAT WILL THE UNITED STATES DO TO THEM?"  THE </p><p>CHARGE RESPONDED THAT THE U.S. HAS STRONGLY URGED THE </p><p>ISRAELIS TO WITHDRAW THEIR FORCES FROM THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES BACK TO ISRAEL PROPER, AND TO REMAIN THERE.  BUT </p><p>THIS WILL ONLY BE EFFECTIVE -- AND ONLY LAST -- IF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS CAN STOP FUTURE SUICIDE BOMBINGS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) BIN ALAWI SAID THAT THE KEY TO RESOLVING THE CRISIS </p><p>IS NOT MILITARY OR SECURITY -- THE ANSWER IS TO RETURN TO A </p><p>POLITICAL PROCESS.  THE SAUDI PROPOSAL, ADOPTED BY THE ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE AT THE RECENT BEIRUT SUMMIT, IS "VERY CLEAR" AND "THE </p><p>ONLY WAY TO STOP THE VIOLENCE."  THE FIRST STEP, SAID BIN </p><p>ALAWI, IS FOR ISRAELI FORCES TO PULL BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE </p><p>"ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2000."  ANY OTHER WORDS OR ACTIONS WILL </p><p>"NOT BE HELPFUL."  AND THE LOSERS, ACCORDING TO BIN ALAWI, </p><p>WILL BE "THE POOR PALESTINIAN PEOPLE."  THE CHARGE SAID THAT </p><p>THE U.S. BELIEVES IN AND IS NOW THOROUGHLY ENGAGED IN A </p><p>POLITICAL DISCUSSION WITH ALL THE PARTIES.  BIN ALAWI ASKED, </p><p>"THEN WHY DON\'T YOU ENFORCE THE AGREEMENTS AND DECISIONS </p><p>WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE?"  WE HAVE HEARD WORDS AND </p><p>STATEMENTS BEFORE, CONTINUED BIN ALAWI.  "WE HAVE HEARD YOU </p><p>SAY \'WE WANT THIS\' AND \'WE HOPE THAT.\'"  WHAT IS NEEDED NOW, </p><p>HE ADDED, ARE NOT WANTS, HOPES, OR WISHES BUT "ACTION."  "IF </p><p>YOU ARE SERIOUS, YOU CAN FORCE THE ISRAELIS TO WITHDRAW."  IT </p><p>HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST.  BUT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IF IT IS </p><p>ONLY A "MATTER OF CONVENIENCE." BEFORE THE ARABS CAN BE </p><p>"TOUGH ON THE PALESTINIANS," BIN ALAWI INSISTED, WE MUST </p><p>FIRST SEE YOU BE "TOUGH ON YOUR FRIENDS, THE ISRAELIS." </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) BIN ALAWI WARNED THAT THE U.S. WAS "MAKING A VERY </p><p>DANGEROUS MISTAKE" IN APPROACHING ARAB LEADERS TO PRESSURE </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS.  "THIS WILL ONLY LEAD TO CONFRONTATION WITH </p><p>THE ARABS," SAID BIN ALAWI, "WHICH NO ONE WANTS."  BY ASKING </p><p>ARABS AND PALESTINIANS TO CONDEMN HAMAS AND ISLAMIC JIHAD, </p><p>YOU ARE IN FACT ASKING THEM TO CONDEMN THE RIGHT OF </p><p>PALESTINIANS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.  THE CHARGE SAID THAT THE </p><p>U.S. INSISTS THAT ALL ACTIONS BY ANY PARTY MUST BE PEACEFUL. </p><p>THEN WHY DO YOU NOT CONDEMN THE ISRAELIS FOR USING F-16\'S, </p><p>APACHE HELICOPTERS, AND TANKS TO ATTACK INNOCENT PALESTINIAN </p><p>CIVILIANS, ASKED BIN ALAWI.  SINCE THE UNITED STATES, THE </p><p>WORLD\'S ONLY SUPERPOWER, WON\'T PROTECT THE PALESTINIANS, </p><p>SUICIDE BOMBING IS THE ONLY WAY LEFT OPEN TO THEM FOR </p><p>SELF-DEFENSE.  SUICIDE BOMBING HAS ENGENDERED MUCH DISMAY AND </p><p>HORROR AND RESULTED IN VERY NEGATIVE IMAGE IN THE U.S., THE </p><p>CHARGE STRESSED.  "F-16\'S AND APACHES HAVE RESULTED IN A VERY </p><p>NEGATIVE IMAGE IN THE ARAB WORLD," BIN ALAWI SHOT BACK. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) WE DO NOT WANT TO DESTROY ISRAEL, BIN ALAWI SAID. </p><p>OMAN HAS FOR MANY YEARS BEEN AN ACTIVE PLAYER IN THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  WE HAVE HAD GOOD RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL.  WE HAVE </p><p>INVESTED HEAVILY IN ISRAEL FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS.  WE </p><p>WANT ISRAEL TO LIVE IN PEACE AND SECURITY WITH ITS NEIGHBORS. </p><p> NO ONE IS ASKING ISRAEL TO COMPROMISE ITS SECURITY.  BUT WE </p><p>WANT THE SAME FOR THE PALESTINIANS.  AND MORE AND MORE ARABS </p><p>ARE BECOMING CONVINCED THAT ISRAEL DOES NOT SEEK PEACE AND </p><p>SECURITY BUT RATHER "PEACE AND TERRITORY."  "AFTER 11 YEARS </p><p>OF A FAILED PEACE PROCESS, ISRAEL NOW WANTS ARAFAT GIVE UP </p><p>PALESTINIAN TERRITORY.  HE WILL NEVER DO THAT."  THE U.S. HAS </p><p>ENTERED VERY DANGEROUS TERRITORY, WARNED BIN ALAWI AGAIN. </p><p>"DON\'T PUSH THE ARABS TO THE WALL." </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) IT IS NOT ONLY THE PALESTINIANS WHO SUFFER FROM THIS, </p><p>CONTINUED BIN ALAWI.  WE ALL DO.  "TELL SECRETARY POWELL THAT </p><p>EVERY DAY WE (THE OMANI GOVERNMENT) FACE HUMILIATION FROM THE </p><p>STREET" BECAUSE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP WITH THE U.S.  NEVER MIND </p><p>ABOUT THE WAR ON TERRORISM OR EVENTS IN AFGHANISTAN OR IRAQ, </p><p>BIN ALAWI SAID.  THE UNITED STATES HAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM -- </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST.  "WE\'VE BEEN DEALING WITH U.S. FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY FOR TWENTY YEARS," BIN ALAWI CONCLUDED.  "THE ONE </p><p>THING WE HAVE LEARNED IS THIS:  YOU ONLY GET ATTENTION IF YOU </p><p>SHOUT.  OTHERWISE, YOU ARE NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY."  CONSIDER ME </p><p>TO BE SHOUTING. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) COMMENT:  WHILE THE MEETING WAS PERFECTLY CORDIAL, </p><p>BIN ALAWI WAS IN LITTLE MOOD TO LISTEN.  HE HAD ORIGINALLY </p><p>GRANTED ONLY FIFTEEN MINUTES WHEN WE REQUESTED THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT; THE DISCUSSION ENDED UP TAKING OVER AN HOUR. </p><p>HIS FRUSTRATION REFLECTS SENTIMENTS WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL </p><p>LEVELS OF OMANI SOCIETY:  WE WANT ACTION, NOT WORDS.  U.S. </p><p>CREDIBILITY IN OMAN HAS BEEN GREATLY DIMINISHED; OMANIS ARE </p><p>CONVINCED THAT WE HAVE COMPLETELY SOLD OUT TO ISRAEL NO </p><p>MATTER WHAT WE SAY.  THE PRESS, INTERNET CHAT ROOMS, AND OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS ALL POINT TO THE LENGTH OF TIME IT IS TAKING </p><p>FOR THE SECRETARY TO REACH ISRAEL; THIS IS SEEN AS A CLEAR </p><p>DELAYING TACTIC TO ALLOW THE ISRAELIS TIME TO FINISH THEIR </p><p>OPERATIONS.  BIN ALAWI\'S ALLEGATIONS THAT GENERAL ZINNI IS </p><p>NOT NEUTRAL BUT IS REPRESENTING THE ISRAELIS MORE THAN THE </p><p>U.S. IS ALSO A UBIQUITOUS BELIEF HERE.  WHEN WE ARRIVED FOR </p><p>THE MEETING, BIN ALAWI HAD A LARGE SCREEN TELEVISION ON HIS </p><p>OFFICE TUNED TO ABU DHABI TV BEAMING GRIM IMAGES FROM THE </p><p>WEST BANK/GAZA.  THE VOLUME WAS SO LOUD, HE HAD TO INTERRUPT </p><p>THE MEETING TO TURN IT OFF.  IT IS LIKELY HE TURNED IT BACK </p><p>ON AS SOON AS WE LEFT -- AND THAT MOST OMANIS ARE WATCHING </p><p>THE SAME THING.  IT IS UNLIKELY ANYTHING WILL BREAK THROUGH </p><p>THEIR ABSORPTION WITH THE VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND </p><p>THEIR ANIMOSITY TOWARDS THE U.S. AND ISRAEL SHORT OF AN </p><p>ISRAELI PULLOUT AND AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO A POLITICAL </p><p>DIALOGUE, OFFERING AT LEAST A GLIMMER OF HOPE AT THE END OF A </p><p>VERY DARK TUNNEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DRY </p><p></p></div>
