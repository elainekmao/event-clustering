STATE 115832 </p><p>     B. ROME 1229 </p><p>     C. STATE 29193 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please </p><p>handle accordingly.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary. Environment Ministry officials, in </p><p>contrast to their previous statements, told U.S. industry </p><p>representatives in a recent meeting that there are currently </p><p>no plans to ban night flights in Italy.  Officials from </p><p>Italy\'s Civil Aviation Authority confirmed that a 1999 </p><p>Presidential Decree banning night flights in Italy is not in </p><p>force.  The Transportation Ministry has been granted an </p><p>advisory role on the implementation of the EU Airport Noise </p><p>Directive.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On Tuesday, May 20, representatives from FedEx, DHL </p><p>and United Technologies met with officials from the Ministry </p><p>of the Environment and from Italy\'s Civil Aviation Authority </p><p>(ENAC) to discuss the GOI\'s implementation of the EU Airport </p><p>Noise Directive and its adherence to ICAO\'s balanced approach. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of the Environment </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Participants: </p><p>Nazzareno Penna, Director, Office of Acoustic Pollution </p><p>Lucio De Carolis, Technical Expert on Noise Pollution </p><p>Darcy Nicolle, United Technologies </p><p>Ralph Carter, FedEx </p><p>Morgan Foulkes, DHL </p><p>David Mulenex, Science Counselor </p><p>Jessamyn Allen, Economic Officer </p><p>David Reimer, Consulate Milan </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  In contrast with our March meeting (Ref B), Penna </p><p>appeared amicable and familiar with both the ICAO balanced </p><p>approach and the EU Directive on airport noise, often quoting </p><p>parts of the EU Directive to the group in support of his </p><p>statements.  At the same time, Penna expressed his belief </p><p>that the four elements (1) reduction of noise at source; (2) </p><p>land use planning and management; (3) operating procedure, </p><p>and (4) operating restrictions, were not/not listed in </p><p>priority order.  While stating that there were no plans at </p><p>present to ban night flights in Italy (a change from his </p><p>previous statements), Penna reminded us that his constituents </p><p>were the environment and the Italian people and not industry </p><p>or airports. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  After the industry group walked Penna through UK </p><p>and French airport noise studies, he said that he was open to </p><p>a dialogue with industry and explained that it might also be </p><p>useful for the industry team to meet with the appropriate </p><p>parties at the local level, including the airport committees </p><p>and the twenty-one regional agencies of Italy\'s Environmental </p><p>Protection Agency (APAT).  While supporting discussions at </p><p>the local level, he underscored with us that his office made </p><p>the final decision nationally on implementing the EU </p><p>Directive. </p><p> </p><p>Italy\'s Civil Aviation Authority (ENAC) </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Participants: </p><p>Alessandro Cardi, Head of Regulation Service </p><p>Franco Conte, Airport Planning </p><p>Enrico Deodati, Office of Airport Coordination </p><p>Darcy Nicolle, United Technologies </p><p>Ralph Carter, FedEx </p><p>Morgan Foulkes, DHL </p><p>Jessamyn Allen, Economic Officer </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  As expected, ENAC officials expressed their </p><p>support for ICAO\'s balanced approach and explained that they </p><p>were still working on having the jurisdiction for </p><p>implementing the EU Directive moved to the Ministry of </p><p>Transportation, or at the least, giving the MOT an advisory </p><p>role in the process.  (NOTE:  We were informed several days </p><p>later that the Ministry of Transportation (and thus ENAC) had </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>been granted this advisory role and would begin to work with </p><p>the Ministry of the Environment on the implementation of the </p><p>EU Directive.  End Note.) </p><p>8.  (U)  During the meeting, ENAC officials explained the </p><p>system of noise zones around the airports and told us that </p><p>that airport noise studies are being conducted at all Italian </p><p>airports with potential noise pollution problems.  At the end </p><p>of the meeting, ENAC officials presented us with a copy of a </p><p>Presidential Decree of 1999 banning night flights between </p><p>2300 and 0600.  Several days later Cardi called to explain </p><p>that this decree had been annulled and was not in effect as </p><p>had previously been thought. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Comment. There appears to be no imminent threat of </p><p>a GOI ban on night flights in Italy.  Moreover, with the </p><p>Ministry of Transportation now having the authority to advise </p><p>the Ministry of the Environment on the implementation of the </p><p>EU Airport Noise Directive, the GOI is more likely to adhere </p><p>to a balanced approach.  Embassy will monitor this issue </p><p>closely and continue urging the GOI to avoid operating </p><p>restrictions as a measure of first resort to control noise </p><p>levels at airports.  End Comment. </p><p>SKODON </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02595 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
