O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Tractor Sales Nearly Dead </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for Internet posting. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Zimbabwe\'s largest tractor dealer says </p><p>sales last year were off 98 percent from the late-1990s, </p><p>a measure of commercial agriculture\'s staggering </p><p>nosedive.  Meanwhile, the GOZ is assisting an indigenous </p><p>firm to import cheap Renault tractors from India by </p><p>making foreign exchange available at the official rate of </p><p>Z$55:US$1.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>5-Fold Price Increase </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Bain Group Marketing Manager P.D. Hickman </p><p>recounted annual domestic sales of 1,500 tractors in the </p><p>late-1990s.  Last year the sector sold just 40 units. </p><p>Bain Group both imports and manufactures tractors, having </p><p>maintained its approximate 50 percent market share </p><p>through the present turmoil.  In a case of mega-sticker- </p><p>shock, the price of a top-of-the-line 300-horsepower </p><p>tractor has risen from Z$ 7 to 35 million in a little </p><p>over a year.  For farmers who must sell at artificially- </p><p>low controlled prices, Hickman said it is no longer </p><p>possible to recoup investments in new equipment.  At the </p><p>same time, white farmers dispossessed through the GOZ\'s </p><p>fast-track land reform have flooded the market with used </p><p>tractors at bargain-basement prices.  (The GOZ forbids </p><p>the export of second-hand tractors.)  The GOZ\'s </p><p>elimination of a 5 percent duty on imported agricultural </p><p>equipment in the 2003 budget has not offset the hefty </p><p>devaluation.  The GOZ is trying to address this crisis by </p><p>enabling politically-connected indigenous firm Tanaka </p><p>Power to access foreign currency at official rates in </p><p>order to sell India-made Renault tractors for less than </p><p>10 percent of the market cost.  It is not clear, however, </p><p>how much foreign exchange the cash-strapped GOZ will be </p><p>able to make available to Tanaka Power. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Given its slow sales, Bain Group has fired half </p><p>its 620 workers, indirect employment casualties of land </p><p>reform.  However, the company is still trying to cope by </p><p>exporting more and altering its product mix for recently </p><p>resettled farmers.  Bain Group is selling increasing </p><p>amounts of ox-drawn implements to large-scale (A2) </p><p>settlers.  But opportunities are limited since Hickman </p><p>estimates only a small number of A2 farmers are actually </p><p>tilling land and planting crops.  (Representatives of the </p><p>Indigenous Commercial Farmers Union, whose ranks have </p><p>swelled with "new" farmers, tell us they estimate only 15 </p><p>percent of present A2 beneficiaries will prove viable.) </p><p>At the same time, white Zimbabwean farmers starting over </p><p>in Zambia, Mozambique and Malawi are placing fresh orders </p><p>for Bain Group tractors and implements.  Hickman said </p><p>this brand loyalty of emigrant Zimbabwean farmers is </p><p>helping the firm expand in these markets. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) The fall in annual tractor sales epitomizes </p><p>commercial agriculture\'s decline.  While most small-scale </p><p>resettled (A1) farmers could one day reach subsistence </p><p>levels in rainy years, there is no sign yet that new </p><p>commercial (A2) farmers will produce even a fraction of </p><p>their predecessors\' output.  Zimbabwe\'s loss in </p><p>employment and export revenue is enormous. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
