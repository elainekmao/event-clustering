<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001397 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OPCENTER FOR AMY FLOHR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, ASEC, CASC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: JOS RETURNS TO CALM FOLLOWING POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1350 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary: Jos had returned to calm after PDP Ward </p><p>Congress elections turned violent May 2 in the Northern </p><p>region of the city, Gabriel Makan, PA to Governor Dariye, </p><p>told Poloff on May 3.  After the violence erupted, a joint </p><p>task force of Police, Army and Airforce was able to quell the </p><p>disturbance.  However, at least 20 people were reported </p><p>killed; vehicles, houses and other property were damaged and </p><p>burned.   Metropolitan Jos is under a nighttime curfew, but </p><p>people are reported to be going about their daily business </p><p>this morning. Post has received no warden reports regarding </p><p>AMCITS and has no reason to suspect that any are in danger. </p><p>This episode heightens our concern about electoral violence. </p><p>These areas that have previously experienced communal unrest </p><p>will be even more prone to recommence as electoral </p><p>competition further stirs an already volatile mix.   End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Background On the Ward System In Jos </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>2. (C) Northern Jos consists of 14 wards divided partially </p><p>along ethnic/religious lines: five are majority Hausa wards, </p><p>five majority non-Hausa wards, three wards approximately </p><p>evenly split between Hausa and non-Hausa (Laraguta A, </p><p>Laraguta B and Jarawa Jos) and one majority Yoruba ward.  The </p><p>PDP members in the wards met yesterday to choose local party </p><p>officials to represent them at the local level.  These local </p><p>officials would in turn elect the State officials who would </p><p>ultimately choose PDP candidates for all state elections </p><p>including the gubernatorial candidate and candidates for the </p><p>National Assembly.  (Comment: These ward elections were </p><p>originally scheduled for last November.   Governor Dariye </p><p>postponed these elections ostensibly due to security </p><p>concerns.  Dariye claims yesterday\'s outbreak justifies his </p><p>decision in retrospect. Dariye would assert that such </p><p>violence in November on the heels of the September riots </p><p>would have had a more disheartening effect than the May 2 </p><p>eruption. Conversely, Dariye\'s opponents maintain that he </p><p>nullified the November elections because the candidates of </p><p>his choosing did not win. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to Makan, the ward congress elections in the </p><p>majority Hausa wards were conducted by consensus open ballot </p><p>rather than by secret ballot and were therefore completed </p><p>quickly.  Allegedly joined by Hausas from outside Jos, and </p><p>armed with cutlasses and machetes, the group proceeded to </p><p>Laraguta A, Laraguta B and Jarawa Jos with the intent to </p><p>manipulate the election results, through intimidation, he </p><p>commented.  However, the elections in these wards were also </p><p>conducted by consensus, and were already finished in Laraguta </p><p>A and Jarawa Jos before the instigators arrived.   In Jarawa </p><p>Jos the interlopers reportedly held their own consensus </p><p>election in protest, after which their leaders were arrested </p><p>and the rest of the group dispersed without incident. There </p><p>were no incidents reported in Laraguta A. In Laraguta B, the </p><p>largest of the three wards, the residents confronted the </p><p>outsiders.  According to Makan, at least 20 (the </p><p>International Federation of the Red Cross puts the number at </p><p>50) were killed, with victims on both sides.  Houses were </p><p>torched, as were the vehicles of the outside instigators.  He </p><p>added that two churches were also razed.  Newspaper accounts </p><p>give a slightly different version, claiming that a </p><p>misunderstanding developed between election officials and </p><p>voters during the vote and that  "miscreants" capitalized on </p><p>the confusion by throwing stones into the crowd thereby </p><p>causing the disagreement to erupt into violence. In any </p><p>event, Metropolitan Jos is currently under an 8:00 p.m. to </p><p>dawn curfew. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Poloffs met Governor Dariye on Tuesday, April 30. </p><p>During the meeting the Governor spoke in very stark terms </p><p>about last September\'s violence in Jos, describing it as a </p><p>settler versus indigene problem.  The governor is a Christian </p><p>who sees the Hausa/Fulani as  "settlers" even though they </p><p>have been present in the region for over 100 years and </p><p>founded the original Jos settlement.  The governor\'s attitude </p><p>was militant and he stated that the settlers were trying to </p><p>wrest political control of Jos and sabotage the state. </p><p>Dariye stated that he would oppose this alleged encroachment. </p><p> Dariye also intimated that he would not advise his </p><p>supporters to turn the other cheek should they be forcibly </p><p>confronted by political opponents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Poloff also spoke to Dr. Musa Musa Minister of </p><p>Commerce for Bauchi State (borders Plateau State) about the </p><p>crisis.  Dr. Musa, who is Hausa/Fulani, believed that the </p><p>conflict was the result of the rivalry between Damishi Sango, </p><p>former Minister of Sports, who was removed by Dariye and is </p><p>now running for Governor against Dariye in 2003.  He received </p><p>no reports of Hausas fleeing Plateau State for Bauchi State, </p><p>an exodus which had occurred during previous incidents of </p><p>ethnic violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Wards in Plateau were to hold their congress elections </p><p>yesterday, however, some wards outside of Jos were unable to </p><p>do so.  This will necessarily postpone the May 4 local party </p><p>Congress, until all ward elections can be completed.  Makan </p><p>did not suggest a new date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------- </p><p>7. (C) Thursday\'s violence was spawned by inter-party rivalry </p><p>at the lowest possible level.  As Nigeria moves toward local </p><p>elections in August and gubernatorial and national elections </p><p>in April 2003 the tendency for violence will likely escalate </p><p>as the political stakes become higher. Responsible leadership </p><p>on the part of elected officials, candidates and senior party </p><p>members is needed to keep the violence down.  However, such </p><p>leadership may be wanting in Plateau, at least from the </p><p>Governor\'s Mansion, because Dariye, in some ways appears to </p><p>be eager for a fight, and given the ethnic dynamics in the </p><p>state, he may get one. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
