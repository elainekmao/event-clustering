<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002624 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EB/CBA NSMITH-NISSLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, EINV, ELAB, ETRD, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: NOMINATION FOR AWARD FOR CORPORATE EXCELLENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 73362 </p><p> </p><p>CCKM Apparel Manufacturing (Jordan) LTD. has been a leader in </p><p>promoting worker rights and workplace standards in Jordan\'s </p><p>fastest-growing industrial sector during a difficult time in </p><p>the Middle East.  CCKM Jordan\'s good corporate citizenship </p><p>has drawn praise from factory workers, industrial park </p><p>managers, and U.S. retailers as a model for responsible </p><p>investment in a sector that is heavily impacted by labor </p><p>rights issues.  Recognizing CCKM\'s leadership with the award </p><p>for corporate excellence will help expand their example of </p><p>good corporate citizenship throughout Jordan\'s economy, and </p><p>will highlight the potential for Arab-Israeli economic </p><p>cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>CCKM Apparel Manufacturing (Jordan) LTD. is a wholly-owned </p><p>subsidiary of New York-based Cannon County Knitting Mills </p><p>(CCKM).  CCKM first invested in Jordan in 2001, bringing $2.5 </p><p>million dollars and over 350 new jobs into the local economy. </p><p> CCKM\'s decision to invest in Jordan represents in part a </p><p>desire by owner Marty Granoff to make a concrete contribution </p><p>to peace in the region by strengthening economic ties between </p><p>Jordan and Israel through the Qualifying Industrial Zones </p><p>(QIZ) initiative.  The initiative, which gives tariff breaks </p><p>to companies that export goods with Jordanian and Israeli </p><p>content to the U.S., has produced an explosion of growth in </p><p>Jordan\'s garment manufacturing sector, creating thousands of </p><p>new jobs directly and tens of thousands indirectly.  In the </p><p>process, it has created a constituency for peace in Jordanian </p><p>communities benefiting from new employment opportunities. </p><p>CCKM Jordan has taken the lead in ensuring that the </p><p>initiative develops in a sustainable and responsible fashion. </p><p> </p><p>CCKM leads first and foremost by example, with a strong </p><p>commitment to workplace safety.  Along with Jordanian Labor </p><p>Ministry officials, compliance inspectors from major U.S. </p><p>retailers keep a close eye on conditions in QIZ factories. </p><p>No factory has a better track record than CCKM.  In fact, the </p><p>manager of the industrial park in which CCKM is located often </p><p>uses this factory as its showcase for prospective investors </p><p>and buyers\' agents.  This commitment to workplace safety is </p><p>matched by CCKM\'s commitment to its workers individually. </p><p>CCKM has instituted a nutritional supplement program for its </p><p>workers that provides them with morning energy drinks and </p><p>subsidizes 90% of their lunch bills to ensure good worker </p><p>health.  CCKM also has a staunch commitment to training:  the </p><p>company wrote off its first year of production, instead </p><p>devoting 100% of its time - and its salary budget - to </p><p>training programs that lasted up to six months per worker. </p><p> </p><p>CCKM has also embraced the local community as it has </p><p>developed its workforce.  CCKM holds regular graduation </p><p>ceremonies for workers who complete training programs, along </p><p>with factory tours for family members.  These celebrations </p><p>have an enormous impact in traditional societies that are </p><p>suspicious of allowing women into the workplace.  By </p><p>including families into the training process, CCKM has </p><p>dispelled fathers\' misgivings about sending their daughters </p><p>into factory work, and has replaced those misgivings with </p><p>pride in seeing their daughters finish training courses that </p><p>give them marketable skills (for some, the only formal </p><p>education they\'ve received).  It has also given the community </p><p>a stake in the success of the business.  Finally, CCKM is </p><p>training an all-Jordanian workforce.  In an industry that </p><p>relies heavily on expatriate labor (expats make up 25-33% of </p><p>total sector employment), CCKM has pledged to the government </p><p>and the community that the jobs it creates will be for </p><p>Jordanians.  The effectiveness of CCKM\'s approach is </p><p>measurable:  while they pay less than the average QIZ </p><p>factory, they still have stacks of applications from new </p><p>workers and prospective transferees from other plants, all of </p><p>whom want to work in the family environment CCKM has created. </p><p> </p><p>CCKM makes other fine contributions to the community - be it </p><p>educating the Jordanian government on the importance of </p><p>worker rights issues, or lobbying the Israeli government to </p><p>expand the benefits of the QIZ initiative into higher </p><p>value-added product lines in order to create more jobs and </p><p>further solidify bilateral commercial ties.  But it is the </p><p>demonstrated commitment to the well-being of its workers that </p><p>makes CCKM the standard-bearer for responsible investment in </p><p>Jordan, and that is what makes CCKM a deserving recipient of </p><p>the award for corporate excellence. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
