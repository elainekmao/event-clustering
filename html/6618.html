<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000588 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD/PA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Bush, Blair must learn from </p><p>      history" the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      dedicated its March 21 editorial to declaring that the </p><p>      war against Iraq is uncalled for and is bound to fail, </p><p>      adding, "America must not be allowed to bully the </p><p>      world."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "German autocrat, Otto von Bismarck, was once </p><p>      caricatured as a man walking on gunpowder with a </p><p>      burning cigarette in his mouth.  We regret that </p><p>      this could easily apply to America\'s George Bush </p><p>      and Britain\'s Tony Blair who seem to have learnt </p><p>      nothing from history.  History will record that </p><p>      unilateral steps taken by superpowers have </p><p>      failed in the past. . .  There is no </p><p>      justification whatsoever for the Americans to </p><p>      use morality as a reason for ousting Iraqi </p><p>      President Saddam Hussein when it is clear that </p><p>      their desire is to control oil production. </p><p>      History will record the failures of these </p><p>      unilateral campaigns.  Need we remind the </p><p>      Americans of their failure in the Gulf War to </p><p>      oust President Hussein or their disastrous </p><p>      campaign in Vietnam. .  .  While we appreciate </p><p>      Bush\'s zeal to redeem himself after the </p><p>      disastrous campaign in Afghanistan, where he has </p><p>      failed to track down Osama bin Laden, we feel </p><p>      that by attacking Iraq, he has taken matters too </p><p>      far.  The U.S., which has since assumed the role </p><p>      of the world\'s policeman like Hitler tried to </p><p>      do, has defied the United Nations - thus showing </p><p>      the irrelevance of the body in policing </p><p>      superpowers. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .It is sad that the U.S., which is fighting </p><p>      to control Iraqi oil, has in the past lied to </p><p>      the world that it was concerned about human </p><p>      rights issues in the Middle East country.  The </p><p>      truth is out . . .!  The Americans, in a clear </p><p>      fear of the unknown, have said that they fear </p><p>      reprisals from terrorist organizations.  We say </p><p>      that those who live in glass houses should not </p><p>      throw stones.  Here will be a typical case of </p><p>      violence begetting violence.  For as long as the </p><p>      Americans bully other nations and ignore the </p><p>      United Nations, we do not wish them well.  We </p><p>      wait with anticipation for those who have </p><p>      declared a jihad on America to remind George </p><p>      Bush et al that the oil he wishes to control is </p><p>      not worth the blood that will be shed in the war </p><p>      against Iraq.  America must not be allowed to </p><p>      bully the world.  We are not all American." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
