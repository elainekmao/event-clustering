The Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) has finally issued a </p><p>formal request for humanitarian assistance to the United </p><p>Nations (UN).  The primary request is for additional (not </p><p>in the pipeline) food aid in the amount of 600,000 MT of </p><p>maize to fill what the GOZ perceives to be the "food </p><p>gap," the difference between anticipated national </p><p>requirements and the national harvest and carryover </p><p>stocks.  The amount of food aid the GOZ has requested is </p><p>considerably more than that requested in the WFP\'s </p><p>appeal.  Additional food-related requirements include </p><p>supplementary and therapeutic feeding of malnourished </p><p>children.  Agricultural-related requests include inputs </p><p>for agricultural recovery and livestock rehabilitation, </p><p>and irrigation infrastructure and rehabilitation.  On the </p><p>health side, HIV/AIDS is awarded a high priority.  Within </p><p>this sector, the GOZ is appealing for assistance for </p><p>vaccines; drugs to combat HIV/AIDS and opportunistic </p><p>infections, malaria, TB and other diseases; and water and </p><p>sanitation.  Aside from some minimal support for </p><p>livestock recovery and seeds, the only GOZ contribution </p><p>to its own appeal would be some 284,000 Metric Tons (MT) </p><p>of "opening stocks" and a yet to be fully budgeted amount </p><p>of funds to continue its woefully inadequate "Public </p><p>Works" (Cash-for-Work) program.  In a letter from the </p><p>Ministry of Finance, the GOZ requests donors to fill the </p><p>entire food gap, in conjunction with commercial imports. </p><p>Humanitarian assistance for all other sectors is clearly </p><p>expected to come from the international donor community. </p><p>We believe the GOZ can and should be responsible for some </p><p>of the 600,000 MT of cereal needs, either through using </p><p>its own scarce but fungible forex resources, or by </p><p>allowing well-heeled elements in the private sector to </p><p>participate.   Post provides current plans and </p><p>recommendations for the USG response to this appeal. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>GOZ ISSUES APPEAL FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  On 21 July 2003, the Minister of Finance and Economic </p><p>Development presented the UN with the long-awaited formal </p><p>GOZ appeal for humanitarian assistance.  The World Food </p><p>Program (WFP) had already issued an Emergency Operation </p><p>appeal (EMOP) for food aid from July 2003 through June </p><p>2004 (Reftel B).  The UN Consolidated Appeal (CAP) for </p><p>emergency humanitarian assistance has been ready for </p><p>weeks awaiting a formal GOZ request.  In the meantime, </p><p>donors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have </p><p>been attempting to plan based on "unofficial working </p><p>estimates" to address what they perceive as a </p><p>deteriorating humanitarian situation in country. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>IT\'S STILL DROUGHT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  The GOZ Appeal acknowledges that Zimbabwe is facing a </p><p>severe crisis and that macroeconomic "challenges," lack </p><p>of foreign exchange, a balance of payments deficit and </p><p>high levels of inflation are factors contributing to this </p><p>crisis.  It continues to maintain, however, that the </p><p>government\'s agrarian land reform program bears no </p><p>culpability for the country\'s continuing economic </p><p>collapse and, to the contrary, remains its major strategy </p><p>for poverty reduction in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>4.  More than three pages of the 20-page appeal are </p><p>devoted to an exegesis of the series of droughts that </p><p>Zimbabwe has experienced since 1991.  The document places </p><p>drought, weather, and ill-timed and unpredictable rains </p><p>front and center as the prime cause of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>troubles.  While three years of drought have eroded </p><p>traditional coping mechanisms and while drought certainly </p><p>played a part in last year\'s crisis, drought is chronic </p><p>in certain regions of Zimbabwe and, alone, has never </p><p>brought the country to its knees.  It is certainly not </p><p>the sole or even primary cause of the situation in which </p><p>Zimbabwe finds itself currently, as corroborated by the </p><p>significantly improved harvests and food security </p><p>conditions in many of the country\'s neighbors this year. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>HIV/AIDS GAINS CENTER STAGE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  For the first time, the GOZ appeal places HIV/AIDS </p><p>center stage.  Mitigation of the impact of HIV/AIDS is </p><p>given high priority and its invasive and debilitating </p><p>effects on all areas and populations in Zimbabwe are </p><p>acknowledged.  In a country where more than 30 percent of </p><p>the sexually active adult population is infected by the </p><p>disease, HIV/AIDS compounds the current humanitarian </p><p>crisis at every level.  HIV/AIDS not only exacerbates </p><p>food insecurity and decimates valuable human resources </p><p>but is, in turn, complicated and fed by the malnutrition </p><p>and opportunistic diseases that are byproducts of food </p><p>insecurity.  Accordingly, this new prominence for </p><p>HIV/AIDS in the national agenda is welcome. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>THE FOOD GAP </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. The GOZ blames the delay in the release of its appeal </p><p>on trying to come up with an accurate maize crop </p><p>estimate.  In arriving at its estimate, the government </p><p>has "creatively" averaged the figures from recent </p><p>Government crop forecast assessments, the ZIMVAC and the </p><p>FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM) </p><p>to arrive at an estimated maize crop of 900,000 MT. </p><p>[Note:  Although similar large shortages exist for wheat, </p><p>there is no mention of wheat balances or requirements </p><p>throughout the entire document.  End Note.]  Against an </p><p>estimated national maize requirement of roughly 1.9 </p><p>million MT, less estimated "opening" stocks of 284,000 MT </p><p>(presumably including some combination of outstanding </p><p>contracted government imports and on-going purchases of </p><p>the domestic crop), the resulting shortfall is 710,000 </p><p>MT.  Correctly noting an estimated 120,000 MT in WFP\'s </p><p>food aid pipeline (Reftel B), the Appeal, therefore, </p><p>identifies a 600,000 MT food gap that it requests to be </p><p>filled entirely by the international donor community. </p><p> </p><p>7. The only evident GOZ contribution would be the 284,000 </p><p>MT of planned imports/local purchases noted above that </p><p>have yet to materialize, and an as yet not fully budgeted </p><p>ZW$ 28 billion to continue its heavily criticized ZW$ 42 </p><p>billion "Publics Works" (Cash-for-Work) program over the </p><p>coming year, with the balance ZW$14 billion being met "by </p><p>the donor community and the private sector."  [Note: </p><p>While the official exchange rate remains ZWD 824:USD 1, </p><p>the parallel market rate is now 3,350:1.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>NON-FOOD ASSISTANCE </p><p>REQUESTED BY GOZ </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  The GOZ Appeal requests assistance in a number of non- </p><p>food sectors, too.  For agriculture, the appeal requests </p><p>support for agricultural recovery to promote "food </p><p>sufficiency through increased production in communal, </p><p>resettlement and commercial farming areas," pointedly </p><p>noting prior donor discrimination in excluding the newly </p><p>resettled farmers from international relief assistance to </p><p>date.  The need for livestock inputs (ZW$ 120 billion), </p><p>seeds and fertilizers for cereal and oil crops (ZW$ 758 </p><p>billion) is highlighted.   The GOZ makes a sweeping, but </p><p>vague commitment to "fund 50 percent for the cereals, </p><p>beef and small stock, and 30 percent of oil seeds, crops </p><p>and horticulture."  In addition, the appeal includes a </p><p>request for an estimated ZW$ 6.65 billion for short-, </p><p>medium- and long-term irrigation infrastructure </p><p>rehabilitation and development. </p><p> </p><p>9. Additional areas in which assistance is requested are: </p><p>-- Malnutrition - Therapeutic and supplementary feeding, </p><p>including vitamin supplements, in 31 districts in which </p><p>global acute malnutrition exceeds 5 percent and/or severe </p><p>acute malnutrition exceeds 2 percent, according to the </p><p>recent UNICEF National Nutritional Survey results.  No </p><p>beneficiary numbers or estimated dollar cost is indicated </p><p>for this category of assistance. </p><p>-- Health - Support for health facilities and initiatives </p><p>in the form of equipment, drugs, vaccines, insecticides </p><p>(anti-malarial) and gases that the government cannot </p><p>import due to foreign currency constraints.  [Note: A </p><p>long shopping list is attached to the appeal as an annex, </p><p>including drugs for HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB and other </p><p>diseases.]  While estimated caseloads and quantities are </p><p>provided, no dollar costs are presented for these </p><p>requirements either. </p><p>-- Water and Sanitation - Rehabilitation of water </p><p>sources, submerged boreholes and sanitary facilities </p><p>damaged during recent heavy rains or drought as well as </p><p>installation of water services in previously non-serviced </p><p>areas, i.e., resettlement areas, in six provinces </p><p>(Masvingo, Midlands, Matabeleland South and North, </p><p>Manicaland and Mashonaland Central).  Again, while </p><p>assistance requirements are specified, no estimated </p><p>dollar costs are included for this category of </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>USG FOOD AID RESPONSE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Generally, the GOZ Appeal confirms what we have known </p><p>for some time via other recent assessments (see Reftels). </p><p>Despite the consensus that this year\'s maize harvest is </p><p>better than last year\'s, the overall food security </p><p>situation in Zimbabwe will not improve significantly over </p><p>the current marketing year.  Continued economic collapse, </p><p>increased scarcity of food commodities and concomitant </p><p>higher prices and profiteering will largely negate most </p><p>benefits of the increased harvest.  In particular, the </p><p>situation in urban areas is expected to deteriorate.  In </p><p>the appeal, the GOZ has at least tacitly acknowledged its </p><p>inability to import much, if any, maize in the coming </p><p>year.  Zimbabwe\'s private sector has the financial </p><p>wherewithal to fill the gap if the GOZ cannot, and the </p><p>private sector has the motivation as the Grain Marketing </p><p>Board farm gate price for maize has risen dramatically if </p><p>belatedly to stimulate production and is approaching the </p><p>regional price of maize, calculated at the parallel rate, </p><p>which makes private sector involvement economically </p><p>feasible.  Unless the current policy context is changed, </p><p>however, there will be no private sector imports.  This </p><p>would increasingly leave both urban and rural areas with </p><p>food shortages, particularly as the hungry season </p><p>(December 2003 - April 2004) progresses. </p><p> </p><p>10.  As a result, post suggests that the USG will need to </p><p>provide food aid to Zimbabwe at a level comparable to </p><p>that of last year, and possibly higher.  WFP\'s new EMOP </p><p>includes plans to distribute approximately 450,000 MTs in </p><p>Zimbabwe between July 2003 and June 2004, of which about </p><p>110,000 MTs will be covered by carryover commodities from </p><p>its previous EMOP, leaving "new" donations of 300,000 </p><p>plus MT.  We would expect the USG, through USAID/DCHA\'s </p><p>Office of Food for Peace, to provide between 40 and 50 </p><p>percent of the net additional WFP requirements.  The C- </p><p>SAFE program, which is fully funded by USAID, also plans </p><p>to distribute an additional 100,000 MTs in rural areas </p><p>during this period through targeted free distributions, </p><p>food-for-work programs and supplementary feeding. </p><p>Further, it is anticipated that C-SAFE\'s Market </p><p>Intervention Pilot Program in Bulawayo will provide </p><p>20,000 MTs of sorghum through January 2004.  Depending on </p><p>the success of this pilot program, tonnage may be </p><p>increased if the program continues beyond January 2004 </p><p>and expands into other urban areas. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>USG NON-FOOD AID RESPONSE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. The USG, through USAID/DCHA\'s Office for Foreign </p><p>Disaster Assistance (OFDA), is concentrating its response </p><p>to the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe in the following </p><p>sectors: </p><p>-- emergency nutrition interventions through therapeutic </p><p>and supplementary feeding programs targeted at children </p><p>under five and certain hotspots of persistently high </p><p>malnutrition rates; </p><p>-- agricultural inputs, particularly seeds and technical </p><p>support, for subsistence farming in communal areas to </p><p>foster self-sufficiency; </p><p>-- drip irrigation projects in areas of chronic drought </p><p>and in support of the food security needs of certain </p><p>vulnerable populations such as HIV/AIDs-affected </p><p>households and orphan- and elderly-headed households; </p><p>-- support to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), </p><p>especially ex-commercial farm workers; </p><p>-- rehabilitation of existing water and sanitation </p><p>infrastructures in areas suffering most from the residual </p><p>effects of drought; </p><p>-- support for monitoring the humanitarian response, </p><p>principally through non-governmental agencies, and </p><p>including support for periodic U.N.-supported food </p><p>security and nutrition surveys and needs assessments; and </p><p>-- UN coordination and information dissemination for the </p><p>greater humanitarian response through support to its </p><p>Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs </p><p>(OCHA). </p><p>To date, approximately US$ 6.2 million of OFDA funds have </p><p>been programmed in FY03 in support of UN and NGO </p><p>initiatives in these areas, with a similar amount under </p><p>consideration for early FY04. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>MISSION COMMENTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. While it is essential to provide enough resources to </p><p>meet the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable, it is </p><p>also important that donors avoid giving the impression </p><p>that they are willing to meet the entire food gap in </p><p>Zimbabwe, and/or some of the other non-food needs listed </p><p>in the appeal document (even for the more credible </p><p>requests included therein).  This would seriously </p><p>undermine our joint on-going efforts to pressure the GOZ </p><p>to effect the policy reforms required to facilitate a </p><p>more comprehensive and robust humanitarian response and a </p><p>speedier transition to recovery (see Reftel C). </p><p> </p><p>13. The Mission believes that the set of USG food and non- </p><p>food assistance activities outlined above satisfactorily </p><p>meets these critical minimal relief requirements.  In </p><p>combination with known other donor plans for humanitarian </p><p>assistance to Zimbabwe over the current marketing year </p><p>(especially the EU and DfID), this assistance should </p><p>suffice in meeting this aim, at least through the end of </p><p>the current CY (December 2003).  Post appreciates DCHA\'s </p><p>continuing support in meeting these significant food and </p><p>non-food aid requirements. </p><p> </p><p>14. The GOZ Appeal confirms, at least implicitly, </p><p>government\'s current "bankrupt" status (although we note </p><p>that they have found enough forex recently to purchase </p><p>new luxury vehicles for senior GOZ officials), and its </p><p>purported inability to respond to its citizens\' </p><p>continuing desperate plight (unlike last year, when </p><p>government was able to muster considerable resources of </p><p>its own for food imports).  For this reason, we believe </p><p>that the prospect for GOZ movement on relevant policy </p><p>issues is better than it has been in the past.  We </p><p>believe that UN/donor pressure can best be exerted by </p><p>limited donor response to the amount of the WFP appeal, </p><p>thereby presenting the GOZ with clear options - use its </p><p>own limited forex to import for the GMB, or permit the </p><p>private sector to re-enter the grain import sector.  The </p><p>Mission would like to use the current opportunity to </p><p>press the dialogue on GOZ policy reform to the fullest </p><p>extent possible (ref C).  Accordingly, the Mission does </p><p>not wish to "broadcast" these considerable USG assistance </p><p>plans at this time.  Post will appreciate Washington\'s </p><p>continued cooperation with this request.  Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
