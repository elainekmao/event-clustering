On December 18 the European Union issued a statement </p><p>calling for the Government of Nepal (GON) and Maoist </p><p>insurgents to move ahead toward negotiations.  A December 19 </p><p>report by Amnesty International found human rights abuses in </p><p>Nepal at an unprecedented high.  UN Secretary General Kofi </p><p>Annan\'s report to the UN Security Council, to be released in </p><p>full on December 23, implicates the Maoists in their </p><p>recruitment of children as combatants. A committee of NGO </p><p>activists claimed progress in bringing the GON and Maoists </p><p>to the negotiating table.  However, schools remained closed </p><p>for the second week of an indefinite Maoist educational </p><p>strike.  Maoist violence continued with the murder of two </p><p>innocent civilians, the killings of eleven policemen, and </p><p>the abduction of four children.  Maoists also destroyed 13 </p><p>District Forest Offices. </p><p> </p><p>EU CALLS FOR CEASEFIRE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  On December 18 the European Union (EU) issued a </p><p>statement strongly condemning the ongoing insurgency and </p><p>calling on the Maoists to stop its campaign of killings, </p><p>destruction and harassment, citing concerns over violations </p><p>of human rights and international law.  The EU statement </p><p>called for an immediate ceasefire and asked the government </p><p>and the Maoists to enter into negotiations.  The statement </p><p>also expressed support for the work of The National Human </p><p>Rights Commission, emphasizing the need to implement the </p><p>recommendations in the commission\'s future report, and </p><p>decried evidence of human rights violations committed by the </p><p>security forces. </p><p> </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE IN NEPAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>3.  In a December 19 report entitled "Nepal-A Deepening </p><p>Human Rights Crisis: Time For International Action," Amnesty </p><p>International(AI) declared that human rights abuses have </p><p>reached an unprecedented high.  AI called on the </p><p>international community to address the deepening human </p><p>rights crisis in Nepal and provide assistance to the </p><p>government, to include the establishment of an office of the </p><p>High Commissioner For Human Rights (OICHR).  The AI report </p><p>cites evidence of abuses committed by both the Maoists and </p><p>the security forces. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST USE OF CHILD SOLDIERS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  A preview released on December 16 of a report submitted </p><p>by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to the UN Security </p><p>Council implicates the Maoists in the recruitment of </p><p>children for use as combatants.  Annan\'s report, which will </p><p>be released in full on December 23, includes Nepal in a list </p><p>of countries violating internationally accepted standards, </p><p>which prohibit the recruitment of children under the age of </p><p>fifteen. </p><p> </p><p>SCHOOL STRIKE CONTINUES </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. The student wing of the underground Maoist party, All </p><p>Nepal National Independent Students\' Union (Revolutionary), </p><p>ANNISU-R, has warned that it would resort to a nationwide </p><p>shutdown of academic institutions if the government </p><p>continued with its "irresponsible attitude."  All the </p><p>schools and colleges in the Kathmandu valley remain closed </p><p>indefinitely following the strike, or "bandh," called by the </p><p>pro-Maoist student body on December 9, 2002.  Maoist threats </p><p>to kidnap students from school, as well as physical attacks </p><p>on teachers in some schools, are inhibiting attendance at </p><p>schools in various parts of the country.  Armed insurgents </p><p>recently entered several schools in western Kailali district </p><p>and assaulted teachers in their classrooms.  ANNISU-R warned </p><p>that it would take "bolder steps and actions" if its </p><p>demands, including that the government lift its terrorist </p><p>designation of the group, were not met immediately.  Home </p><p>Minister Dharma Bahadur Thapa, however, has reaffirmed that </p><p>the terrorist label will stay. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Padma Ratna Tuladhar, an NGO activist with links to the </p><p>Maoists, claimed his recent discussions with the Maoist- </p><p>affiliated student union included "positive steps towards a </p><p>solution of the problem."  Tuladhar is a member of a three- </p><p>man committee that hopes to facilitate talks between the </p><p>government and the pro-Maoist student union.  Tuladhar </p><p>predicted the committee "will come up with something </p><p>concrete" after December 25. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UNICEF URGES END TO EDUCATION STALEMATE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Suomi Sakai, UNICEF Representative to Nepal, on December </p><p>16, expressed concern over the education crisis in Nepal and </p><p>called on all parties to stop using education for political </p><p>reasons.  Sakai said that the educational strike only </p><p>disadvantages Nepali children, declaring, "School education </p><p>is a basic right and must be declared a zone of peace." </p><p> </p><p>8.  A number of children\'s rights organizations have voiced </p><p>their concern over the effects that the Maoist insurgency, </p><p>particularly the closure of schools, has on children.  The </p><p>National Human Rights Commission called on the government to </p><p>create an environment that safeguards the right to education </p><p>and said the ANNFSU-R should act responsibly by not </p><p>infringing on the right to education.  The Commission said </p><p>it is ready to play any necessary role to end the disruption </p><p>of education in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS ATTACK POLICE AND CIVILIANS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  In separate incidents, Maoists shot and killed eleven </p><p>policemen.  On December 19 six policemen were killed and </p><p>seven were injured in a Maoist attack on the Koilabas Border </p><p>Police Post in southern Dang, near the border of Nepal and </p><p>India.  According to the local superintendent of police, </p><p>over four hundred rebels attacked the post.  The insurgents </p><p>also made off with rifles and guns taken from the police </p><p>post. </p><p> </p><p>10.  On December 16, Maoists shot and killed a policeman at </p><p>Ramthan in Kapilvastu district.  The rebels fled into a </p><p>nearby jungle after the shooting and security forces </p><p>launched a manhunt for the suspects.  In another incident, a </p><p>group of Maoist rebels hacked a policeman to death on </p><p>December 18, in southwestern Banke District. Two other </p><p>policemen were also killed on December 18 at Surkhet Airport </p><p>in the mid-western part of the country and Taplejung in the </p><p>east.  Both were shot and killed by Maoists while on duty. </p><p>The head constable of the Kailali district was shot and </p><p>killed December 18th in his home by Maoist rebels. </p><p> </p><p>11.  According to security forces, Maoist terrorists </p><p>abducted four children from the western district of Doti and </p><p>killed two brothers from Siddhar VDC in western district of </p><p>Arghakhanchi.  Tarapati Pokhrel and his brother, Tej Prasad </p><p>Pokhrel, had been held captive since their abduction </p><p>November 16th.  Maoists called the killings a "public </p><p>action" and claimed the brothers supported the security </p><p>forces. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST ACTIVITY FORCES EXODUS OF THOUSANDS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  According to local press reports "thousands" of people </p><p>have fled their homes in fear of forced recruitment by the </p><p>Maoists.  The exodus occurred after rumors circulated that </p><p>the rebels were about to attack one of the district </p><p>headquarters in the western Karnali zone.  Maoists have </p><p>reportedly threatened to forcibly recruit the villagers or </p><p>use them as human shields.  Thousands of villagers from the </p><p>mid-western town of Nepalgunj have also left, heading to </p><p>India to escape the rebels, violence and unemployment. </p><p>Officials at the border police post at Nepalganj recorded </p><p>more than 8,000 people passing through during the week of </p><p>December 4-11, the highest weekly figure ever recorded. </p><p>Over 60,000 Nepalis have left their districts in the mid and </p><p>far western regions of Nepal, leaving some villages entirely </p><p>deserted. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS DESTROY 13 DISTRICT FOREST OFFICES </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  Maoist rebels destroyed 13 district forest offices </p><p>(DFO).  According to Kamal Bhakta Shrestha, regional </p><p>director of the Regional Forest Office (RFO), the DFOs in </p><p>Illam, Okhaldhunga, Sankhuwasabha, Bhojpur, Solukhumbu, </p><p>Khotang, Udayapur, Jhapa, Terhathum, Morang, Sunsari, Siraha </p><p>and Taplejung have all been destroyed by the Maoists.  Three </p><p>additional offices, in Mahle, Tellok and Sinam of Taplejung </p><p>district have also fallen into the Maoist control.  A total </p><p>of 32 range posts in the eastern development region have </p><p>been destroyed, causing 130,000 dollars in damages. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Maoists have also caused 40,000 dollars in damages at </p><p>the Modikhkola Hydropower Centre in Parbat District. </p><p>Maoists have targeted the center twice before, including </p><p>setting off a bomb, which destroyed windows, computers and </p><p>furniture. </p><p> </p><p>COMMITMENTS, DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH WANING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  Escalating violence and political instability in Nepal </p><p>are affecting financial and economic commitments to help </p><p>Nepal.  Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Nepal has </p><p>been declining in the past few months.  While the US remains </p><p>the largest bilateral donor, other donors have cited concern </p><p>over the intensifying political turmoil and the weak </p><p>implementation of development programs. According to the </p><p>District Development Committee, Kanchanpur, out of 41 </p><p>planned development projects, only 12 have been completed. </p><p>The GON has blamed its inability to complete the projects </p><p>within the specified time on Maoist activity at the proposed </p><p>development sites. </p><p> </p><p>16.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has also pointed out </p><p>that the number of projects funded by their agency has been </p><p>cut by 50 percent because of the uncertainty of the </p><p>political situation and the escalation of the insurgency. </p><p>Destruction of facilities and infrastructure have adversely </p><p>affected the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), </p><p>particularly in the key areas of tourism and trade, which </p><p>declined 0.6 percent in the fiscal year 2001-2002. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
