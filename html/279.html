SUMMARY:  THE JUNE 3 EDITION OF THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>DAILY CARRIED A FRONT PAGE ARTICLE INDICTING "A SMALL </p><p>GROUP OF PEOPLE" WHO ALLEGEDLY INCITED THE PRESENT </p><p>TURMOIL IN BEIJING AND JUSTIFIED MARTIAL LAW.  THE </p><p>ARTICLE WAS ISSUED BY THE BEIJING MUNICIPAL PARTY </p><p>COMMITTEE, PROBABLY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF </p><p>CONSERVATIVE POLITBURO MEMBER LI XIMING.  LI APPEARS </p><p>TO BE SPEARHEADING THE ATTEMPT TO BRAND ZHAO ZIYANG </p><p>AS A COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE EVENING TELEVISION NEWS ON JUNE 3 BROADCAST A </p><p>STERNLY WORDED MARTIAL LAW HEADQUARTERS ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>STATING THAT TROOPS WILL USE ANY AND ALL MEANS TO </p><p>ENFORCE MARTIAL LAW IN BEIJING.  AS THIS CABLE IS </p><p>DRAFTED, THE MARTIAL LAW HQ IS WARNING BEIJING </p><p>CITIZENS TO STAY OFF THE STREETS IN REPEATED </p><p>TELEVISION BROADCASTS.  DEFENSE MINISTER QIN JIWEI </p><p>ALSO APPEARED ON THE EVENING NEWS.  QIN, WHO IS </p><p>RUMORED TO HAVE OPPOSED MARTIAL LAW, MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>REHABILITATED BY DENG XIAOPING IN ORDER TO COUNTER </p><p>ENHANCED INFLUENCE AMONG PARTY ELDERS.  THE TV NEWS </p><p>ALSO BROADCAST A BAFFLING ADDRESS BY LI PENG ON </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  TENSION MOUNTED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON AS </p><p>BEIJING RESIDENTS VENTED THEIR ANGER BY HARASSING </p><p>MILITARY AND POLICE PERSONNEL AND ATTACKING THEIR </p><p>VEHICLES.  STUDENTS DISPLAYED CAPTURED WEAPONS, </p><p>MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES, INCLUDING IN FRONT </p><p>OF THE ZHONGNANHAI LEADERSHIP COMPOUND.  AN EFFORT TO </p><p>FREE STILL CAPTIVE MILITARY PERSONNEL OR TO CLEAR THE </p><p>SOUTHERN ENTRANCE TO ZHONGNANHAI MAY HAVE BEEN THE </p><p>CAUSE OF A LIMITED TEAR GAS ATTACK IN THAT AREA </p><p>AROUND 1500 HOURS LOCAL.  AROUND THE SAME TIME </p><p>SEVERAL THOUSAND UNARMED, BUT HELMETED, TROOPS TOOK </p><p>UP POSITIONS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE GREAT HALL OF </p><p>THE PEOPLE.  EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON, STUDENT </p><p>LEADERS AND THE FOUR HUNGER STRIKERS HELD A PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE IN WHICH THEY THANKED THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR </p><p>SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE AMBASSADOR HAS REQUESTED THAT ALL EMBASSY </p><p>PERSONNEL NOT ENGAGED IN REPORTING TO REMAIN AT </p><p>HOME.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEOPLE\'S DAILY ARTICLE CONDEMNS CONSPIRATORS, </p><p>JUSTIFIES MARTIAL LAW </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE FRONT PAGE OF THE JUNE 3 PEOPLE\'S DAILY </p><p>CARRIED A LONG ARTICLE ISSUED BY THE BEIJING MUNICIPAL </p><p>PARTY COMMITTEE PROPAGANDA BUREAU INDICTING THE "SMALL </p><p>GROUP" OF CONSPIRATORS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING </p><p>TURMOIL IN THE CAPITAL AND JUSTIFYING MARTIAL LAW AND </p><p>THE POSSIBLE USE OF TROOPS.  THE OPENING SECTION OF </p><p>THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE </p><p>PLANNED TO CREATE TURMOIL FROM AS EARLY AS LATE LAST </p><p>YEAR.  THESE PEOPLE\'S POLITICAL GOAL IS TO NEGATE THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY AND THE SOCIALIST SYSTEM. </p><p>THEY PLANNED SECRETLY IN COLLUSION WITH INTERNAL AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIC LEAGUE AND THE PUBLISHERS OF CHINA SPRING </p><p>MAGAZINE.  AFTER THE DEATH OF HU YAOBANG, THE </p><p>CONSPIRATORS SPREAD RUMORS TO ENFLAME THE SITUATION, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE.  FINALLY, THESE PEOPLE </p><p>MALEVOLENTLY TRAMPLED DEMOCRACY AND LAW TO SPREAD </p><p>SERIOUS SOCIAL DISORDER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN A SECOND SECTION, THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS THAT </p><p>DESPITE THE CESSATION OF THE MAY 13-21 STUDENT HUNGER </p><p>STRIKE, THE CONTINUATION OF MARTIAL LAW IS NECESSARY </p><p>TO RESTORE ORDER AND TO COUNTER THE MACHINATION OF </p><p>THE "SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE."  A FINAL SECTION EXHORTS </p><p>READERS TO "UNITE WITH THOSE WHO CAN BE UNITED AND </p><p>EXPOSE THE SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE INCITING TURMOIL." </p><p>IT VOWS THAT THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH STUDENTS AND OTHER GROUPS WITH </p><p>GRIEVANCES.  IT NOTES THAT SOME WORKERS, CITIZENS, </p><p>AND CADRES WHO SUPPORT THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>WHO MAY HAVE PARTICIPATED IN DEMONSTRATIONS WILL NOT </p><p>BE PURSUED.  THOSE GROUPS OF "HOOLIGANS" SUCH AS THE </p><p>"FLYING TIGERS" MOTORCYCLE BRIGADE AND THE "SUICIDE </p><p>BICYCLE BRIGADES" WILL BE PUNISHED, THE ARTICLE </p><p>STATES.  FINALLY, THE ARTICLE DEMANDS THAT THE "SMALL </p><p>GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO INCITED THE TURMOIL" BE EXPOSED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WE BELIEVE THE ARTICLE TO HAVE BEEN DRAFTED UNDER </p><p>THE GUIDANCE OF POLITBURO MEMBER AND BEIJING PARTY </p><p>COMMITTEE SECRETARY LI XIMING.  AS WE HAVE REPORTED </p><p>IN THE PAST, THE ARCH CONSERVATIVE LI HAS RESOLUTELY </p><p>SIDED WITH LI PENG AND THE ELDERS AND APPEARS TO BE </p><p>SPEARHEADING THE ATTEMPT TO LABEL ZHAO ZIYANG AS A </p><p>COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY.  IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING AN </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL BASIS FOR MARTIAL LAW, THE ARTICLE </p><p>EMPLOYS A VENOMOUS TONE THROUGHOUT IN ITS ATTEMPT TO </p><p>TO ESTABLISH CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE SMALL GROUP OF </p><p>CONSPIRATORS -- READ ZHAO ZIYANG AND HIS FOLLOWERS -- </p><p>WITH ALLEGEDLY ANTI-PARTY AND ANTI-GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF STUDENTS AND DEMONSTRATORS.  THE </p><p>ARTICLE EVEN QUOTES ANTI-DENG AND ANTI-LI PENG BIG </p><p>CHARACTER POSTERS PUT UP ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES SINCE </p><p>THE DEATH OF HU YAOBANG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BEIJING MARTIAL LAW HEADQUARTERS ANNOUNCES THAT THE </p><p>PLA WILL USE ANY AND ALL MEANS TO IMPLEMENT ORDERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE JUNE 3 CCTV EVENING NEWS REPORTED THAT </p><p>MARTIAL LAW HEADQUARTERS ISSUED AN ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>CONCERNING THE ENTRY OF SOME TROOPS INTO THE BEIJING </p><p>CITY CENTER ON THE NIGHT OF MAY 2 (SEE REFS. A AND </p><p>B).  THE ANNOUNCEMENT CLAIMED THAT THE PLA IS BACKED </p><p>BY THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE, BUT FEW HOOLIGANS </p><p>INSULTED, HELD, AND BEAT PLA TROOPS WHO ENTERED THE </p><p>CITY.  SOME PEOPLE EVEN STOLE WEAPONS, THE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT SAID.  IT FURTHER STATED THAT NO ONE HAS </p><p>THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE WITH TROOPS ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT ORDERS.  THE PLA WILL USE ANY AND ALL MEANS </p><p>TO ENFORCE MARTIAL LAW IN THE CAPITAL.  ANYONE </p><p>ORGANIZING RESISTANCE TO THE TROOPS WILL SUFFER THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES, THE ANNOUNCEMENT STATED.  AS THIS CABLE </p><p>IS DRAFTED, BEIJING TELEVISION IS REPEATEDLY </p><p>BROADCASTING A MARTIAL LAW HQ WARNING TO BEIJING </p><p>CITIZENS TO STAY OFF THE STREETS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER QIN JIWEI APPEARS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  CCTV NEWS ALSO REPORTED THAT ON JUNE 3, DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER QIN JIWEI VISITED PLA TROOPS ENCAMPED </p><p>OUTSIDE OF BEIJING.  QIN WAS WIDELY BELIEVED TO HAVE </p><p>OPPOSED THE MAY 20 MARTIAL LAW DECLARATION.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HIS APPEARANCE FOLLOWS BY SEVERAL DAYS A SIMILAR </p><p>APPEARANCE BY PARTY CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION </p><p>MEMBER HONG XUEZHI, WHO ALSO WAS RUMORED TO OPPOSE </p><p>MARTIAL LAW.  QIN WAS SEEN IN THE COMPANY OF A GROUP </p><p>OF HIGH RANKING PLA OFFICERS CASUALLY CHATTING WITH </p><p>TROOPS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE TV NEWS QUOTED QIN AS DELIVERING GREETINGS </p><p>FROM DENG XIAOPING AND YANG SHANGKUN.  THE </p><p>APPEARANCES OF BOTH QIN AND HONG STRONGLY SUGGEST </p><p>THAT THEY HAVE CUT A DEAL WITH AT LEAST DENG XIAOPING </p><p>IN WHICH THEY SUPPORT SOME FORM OF MARTIAL LAW IN RETURN </p><p>FOR THEIR CONTINUED POLITICAL HEALTH.  IT HAS BEEN RUMORED </p><p>IN BEIJING THAT DENG MAY NEED THE TWO IN ORDER TO </p><p>COUNTER THE INCREASED INFLUENCE OF PARTY ELDERS, </p><p>PERHAPS INCLUDING YANG SHANGKUN, IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>ZHAO ZIYANG\'S POLITICAL DEMISE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LI PENG DISCUSSES ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES (|?) </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE LEAD ITEM ON THE JUNE 3 EDITION OF THE </p><p>NIGHTLY TELEVISION WAS RESERVED FOR PREMIER LI PENG, </p><p>WHO APPARENTLY DELIVERED AN ADDRESS ON CHINESE </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ON THE SAME DAY.  LI WAS SHOWN </p><p>SITTING STIFFLY AT A TABLE WITH A MICROPHONE.  HE </p><p>FACED THE CAMERA RIGIDLY AND READ FROM A TELEPROMPTER </p><p>WITH A TONE OF VOICE SIMILAR TO THAT OF HIS MAY 19 </p><p>SPEECH ON THE NEED FOR LAW AND ORDER.  WE WERE </p><p>BAFFLED BY THIS APPEARANCE, IN WHICH THE PREMIER MADE </p><p>NO OBVIOUS REFERENCES TO THE SITUATION IN BEIJING. </p><p>IT COULD HAVE BEEN A NOT VERY REFINED ATTEMPT TO SHOW </p><p>THAT LI IS IN CHARGE AND STILL ABLE TO FOCUS ON </p><p>DAY-TO-DAY STATE COUNCIL BUSINESS.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>BEIJING MARTIAL LAW HQ ANNOUNCEMENT IMMEDIATELY </p><p>FOLLOWED THIS SEGMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 3 </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  TENSION MOUNTED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON ALL </p><p>OVER BEIJING AS RESIDENTS VENTED THEIR ANGER OVER THE </p><p>ENTRANCE OF TROOPS IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF </p><p>JUNE 3.  EMBOFFS ENCOUNTERED A NUMBER OF INCIDENTS IN </p><p>DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN WHICH CROWDS HARASSED MILITARY </p><p>OR POLICE PERSONNEL, FORCED THEIR VEHICLES TO TURN </p><p>AROUND, JEERED AT DISPLAYS OF CAPTURED MILITARY </p><p>EQUIPMENT, OR VANDALIZED CAPTURED MILITARY VEHICLES. </p><p>ONE OF THE HOTTEST AREAS WAS ON CHANGANDAJIE BETWEEN </p><p>THE SOUTH ENTRANCE OF THE ZHONGNANHAI LEADERSHIP </p><p>COMPOUND AND THE BUS-BARRICADE AT THE XIDAN </p><p>INTERSECTION.  A BAMBOO TRIPOD SET UP DIRECTLY IN </p><p>FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE TO ZHONGNANHAI BORE CAPTURED </p><p>MILITARY EQUIPMENT INCLUDING A BAYONET, A TENT STAKE, </p><p>MILITARY SHOES AND CLOTHING.  FURTHER DOWN THE STREET </p><p>TOWARD THE XIDAN INTERSECTION A DISABLED MILITARY BUS </p><p>IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET ALSO DISPLAYED CAPTURED </p><p>EQUIPMENT. ON TOP OF THE BUS A SMALL TABLE HAD BEEN </p><p>PLACED ON WHICH THERE WAS A MACHINE GUN ON A TRIPOD, </p><p>TWO AK-47S, A HELMET, A PLA HAT, AND A BANNER (ONLY </p><p>PARTIALLY VISIBLE) READING "THIS IS LI PENG\'S..." </p><p>THOUSANDS OF ONLOOKERS CROWDED AROUND THE DISPLAYS, </p><p>TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS AND CHEERING THE IMPROMPTU </p><p>SPEECHES DENOUNCING THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A STRIKE PLANNED? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  A BEIJING REVIEW JOURNALIST STOPPED ONE POLOFF </p><p>NOT FAR FROM THE XIDAN INTERSECTION, EAGER TO EXPLAIN </p><p>THE DAY\'S EVENTS.  THE JOURNALIST REPORTED THAT A </p><p>MASSIVE DEMONSTRATION WAS PLANNED FOR 1400 HOURS </p><p>LOCAL AND HE SAID IT HAD BEEN PROPOSED THAT A GENERAL </p><p>STRIKE BE CALLED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STUDENT PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  EARLIER IN THE DAY AROUND NOON LOUDSPEAKERS IN </p><p>TIANANMEN SQUARE BROADCAST A LENGTHY SPEECH BY </p><p>SOMEONE IDENTIFYING HIMSELF AS A JOURNALIST REPORTING </p><p>ON THE ENTRANCE OF TROOPS INTO THE CITY.  THOUSANDS </p><p>OF BYSTANDERS LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AS THE JOURNALIST </p><p>DESCRIBED HOW STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS EVENTUALLY </p><p>PERSUADED THE SOLDIERS TO TURN AROUND.  AT 1300 HOURS </p><p>LOCAL THE STUDENTS HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE NEAR THE </p><p>"GODDESS OF FREEDOM."  STUDENT LEADER WUERKAIXI LED </p><p>OFF THANKING THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR </p><p>CONCERN.  HE ALSO THANKED THE REPORTERS WHO AT "GREAT </p><p>RISK" HAD COME TO COVER THE CONFERENCE.  HE THEN </p><p>INTRODUCED THE FOUR HUNGER STRIKERS.  LIU SHAOBO, A </p><p>DOCTOR OF LITERATURE AT BEIJING NORMAL UNIVERSITY, </p><p>THANKED THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY DURING THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WHEN </p><p>LI PENG, UNDER THE "RUSE OF ENFORCING MARTIAL LAW," </p><p>HAD SENT IN ARMED TROOPS.  LIU SAID EVERYONE HAD A </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO UPHOLD THE IDEAL OF DEMOCRACY FOR </p><p>WHICH THE PEOPLE LONGED.  LIU SAID THE GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE.  HE SAID IT WAS CONTROLLED </p><p>BY A SMALL MINORITY AND DID NOT REFLECT THE WISHES OF </p><p>THE PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>16.  TAIWAN-RAISED MUSICIAN HOU DEJIAN ANNOUNCED THAT </p><p>DONATIONS FROM THE MAY 27 CONCERT FOR FREEDOM IN HONG </p><p>KONG HAD SO FAR TOTALLED 13,700,000 HONG KONG </p><p>DOLLARS.  SUCH SUPPORT, HE SAID, SHOWED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE AND THE CORRECTNESS OF THE MOVEMENT. GAO </p><p>XIN, BEIJING NORMAL UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBER, SPOKE ABOUT HOW AS A PARTY </p><p>MEMBER HE WAS DOING THE CORRECT THING BY FASTING.  HE </p><p>WAS RESPONDING TO THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE WHICH WAS </p><p>WHAT THE PARTY AND ITS MEMBERS WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. </p><p> </p><p>17.  IN RESPONSE TO A REPORTER\'S QUESTION,  LIU </p><p>XIAOBO SAID THE MOVEMENT MUST CONTINUE ITS PEACEFUL </p><p>METHODS TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS AND THAT THE PEOPLE MUST </p><p>DO NOTHING OUT OF ANGER.  THE PRESS CONFERENCE ENDED </p><p>WITH WUERKAIXI BEING RAISED UP ON OTHER STUDENTS\' </p><p>SHOULDERS AND CARRIED AROUND THE SQUARE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A TEAR GAS ATTACK </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, A FEW PLA SOLDIERS </p><p>REMAINED CAPTIVE THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON ABOARD </p><p>THEIR DISABLED BUSES IN THE FUYOUJIE INTERSECTION </p><p>BETWEEN ZHONGNANHAI AND XIDAN.  AN EFFORT TO FREE </p><p>THESE TROOPS MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF A TEAR GAS </p><p>ATTACK IN THE AREA SOMETIME AFTER 1500 HOURS LOCAL. </p><p>IT MAY HAVE ALSO BEEN AN EFFORT TO CLEAR JEERING </p><p>CROWDS FROM THE FRONT OF ZHONGNANHAI.  IN EITHER </p><p>CASE, IT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN A LIMITED ATTACK. </p><p>THERE WERE ALSO SOME UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF BEATINGS. </p><p> </p><p>19.  ABOUT THE SAME TIME, SEVERAL THOUSAND TROOPS, </p><p>UNARMED BUT WEARING HELMETS, APPEARED ON THE WEST </p><p>SIDE OF THE GREAT HALL OF PEOPLE WHERE THEY SAT IN </p><p>ROWS TWO-TO-THREE MEN DEEP.  THEY APPEARED </p><p>WELL-DISCIPLINED.  SEVERAL BYSTANDERS WERE OBSERVED </p><p>THROWING THINGS AT THE TROOPS, BUT THEY DID NOT </p><p>RESPOND.  MEANWHILE THE EAST SIDE OF THE GREAT HALL, </p><p>ON TIANANMEN SQUARE REMAINED RELATIVELY NORMAL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY SECURITY </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  THE AMBASSADOR HAS REQUESTED THAT ALL EMBASSY </p><p>EMPLOYEES NOT ENGAGED IN POLITICAL OR MILITARY </p><p>REPORTING AND DEPENDENTS TO REMAIN AT HOME.  SECTION </p><p>HEADS HAVE PASSED THE WORD TO EMPLOYEES.  EMBOFF IN </p><p>VICINITY OF TIANANMEN SQUARE IS NOTIFYING ALL </p><p>AMERICANS THAT HE ENCOUNTERS IN THE AREA TO LEAVE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LILLEY </p><p></p></div>
