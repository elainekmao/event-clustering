THE SAME </p><p>STORY, WHICH WAS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL IN BOTH SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI AND CENTER- </p><p>LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR, ALSO QUOTED </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN OFFICIAL STATEMENT REJECTING THE </p><p>"CAMPAIGN AGAINST PALESTINIAN INDEPENDENCE" AND THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CALLS FOR CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AGAINST THE </p><p>ISRAELI CIVIL AUTHORITY IF IT REPLACES THE PNA, AND THE </p><p>THREAT TO RETURN TO TOTAL MILITARY ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>ARABIC-LANGUAGE WEEKLY ASSABEEL, GENERALLY REFLECTING </p><p>THE VIEWS OF THE ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT (THE POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY BASED ON THE MUSLIM BROTHERS MOVEMENT), </p><p>CRITICIZED THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT STRONGLY FOR ITS: </p><p>"EXAGGERATED OFFICIAL WELCOME OF THE U.S. PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>WORST SPEECH SO FAR."  AMONG THE PEOPLE INVITED TO </p><p>COMMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S REACTION WAS A FORMER </p><p>MINISTER OF CULTURE WHO EXPLAINED THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>POSITION AS BEING INTENDED TO "WARD OFF HARM." </p><p>ASSABEEL WAS THE ONLY NEWSPAPER TO QUOTE THE STATEMENT </p><p>OF THE ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT THAT CRITICIZED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT FOR "SUPPORTING A SPEECH THAT EQUATES </p><p>BETWEEN JIHAD AND TERRORISM" AND THE STATEMENT OF THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERS, WHICH SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>SPEECH: "LEFT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE NO OPTION BUT </p><p>JIHAD." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p>-- BUSH\'S SPEECH AND IGNORING THE FACT OF THE </p><p>OCCUPATION </p><p>FORMER PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY HAMADEH FARA\'NEH WROTE IN </p><p>SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JULY </p><p>2: "PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH\'S SPEECH TURNED A BLIND EYE </p><p>TO THE ONE REASON THAT SPARKED OFF AND ACCUMULATED THE </p><p>CONTINUOUS AGGRESSION, CONFLICT, AND FRUSTRATION IN OUR </p><p>REGION, WHICH IS ISRAEL\'S OCCUPATION OF THE LAND THAT </p><p>BELONGS TO THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE BEEN </p><p>MARGINALIZED FOR DECADES.  PRESIDENT BUSH IS WORKING TO </p><p>ENSURE HIS PARTY\'S VICTORY IN THE NOVEMBER </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS, AND TO SECURE A SECOND TERM </p><p>FOR HIMSELF . EVEN IF THIS IS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS AND THEIR CONTINUED SUFFERING." </p><p> </p><p>-- A COORDINATED AMERICAN ISRAELI AGGRESSION </p><p>THE LEADING COMMENTARY OF CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR READ ON JULY 2: "IT IS NO </p><p>LONGER A SECRET TO ANY OBSERVER OF THE MIDDLE EAST THAT </p><p>THE CONTINUOUS ISRAELI AGGRESSION AGAINST THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, THE TRAVESTIES, DEATH, DESTRUCTION, </p><p>AND TERROR, ARE DONE WITH OPEN U.S. ENCOURAGEMENT AND </p><p>WITH UNRESERVED POLITICAL SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION THAT SEES THIS AGGRESSION AS SELF- </p><p>DEFENSE AND THAT SEES ARIEL SHARON AS A MAN OF PEACE. </p><p>WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES IS A </p><p>COORDINATED AMERICAN-ISRAELI AGGRESSION, BUT WE WARN </p><p>AGAINST GIVING FREE REIGN TO SHARON WHO IS EXPLOITING </p><p>UNLIMITED AMERICAN SUPPORT TO NURTURE EXTREMISM, </p><p>CONSOLIDATE THE OCCUPATION, DESTROY ANY CHANCE FOR </p><p>PEACE, AND PROBABLY DRAG THE REGION TO ANOTHER WAR." </p><p> </p><p>-- A NEW DISASTER </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST JAMIL AL-NIMRY WROTE IN INDEPENDENT, </p><p>MASS-APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM ON JULY 2: </p><p>"COLIN POWELL DASHED THE HOPES OF ARAB OFFICIALS BY </p><p>ADOPTING THE WORST POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION OF PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH\'S SPEECH.  HE NOT ONLY RULED OUT THE PROSPECTS OF </p><p>AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN THE PRESENT, BUT ALSO </p><p>AFFIRMED THE PRECONDITION OF CHANGING THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP, WHICH WAS REEMPHASIZED CATEGORICALLY BY </p><p>RICE.  SEEN FROM HERE, THERE IS NO AIM FOR THE AMERICAN </p><p>PERFORMANCE EXCEPT TO SUPPORT THE ISRAELI PROGRAM, </p><p>USING TALK ABOUT A PALESTINIAN STATE AS A WEAK AND </p><p>WORTHLESS COVER.  IF THE OFFER WERE OF A PALESTINIAN </p><p>STATE AND AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN RETURN FOR </p><p>ARAFAT\'S RESIGNATION, WE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO CALL ON </p><p>HIM TO DO SO.  BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. IT IS A REPEAT </p><p>OF THE SAGA OF IRAQ AND SADDAM, WHICH IS JUST A PRETEXT </p><p>FOR EXTENDING THE SIEGE INDEFINITELY." GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
