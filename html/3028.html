<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002696 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST AND SUICIDE </p><p>BOMBINGS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- The lead story in the Jordanian media today, May </p><p>28, focuses on the Moroccan King\'s visit to Jordan and </p><p>his talks with King Abdullah about regional </p><p>developments.  Another lead story highlights the </p><p>suicide bombing in Tel Aviv yesterday and Israel\'s </p><p>"reoccupation" of some Palestinian cities. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Martyrdom operations are within the context" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(05/28):  "In the beginning of the Intifada and when </p><p>Israeli occupation forces would enter the Palestinian </p><p>areas known as zone A, we would hear protests all the </p><p>way from Europe to the United States, forcing Israel </p><p>to pull its forces.  This happened because the world </p><p>then believed that these Israeli invasions would </p><p>destroy the peace process.  We no longer hear these </p><p>protests.  The reality is Zone A does not exist in </p><p>practice, and, simply, neither does the Palestinian </p><p>sovereignty on the ground.  The clock has really </p><p>turned back.  The victims are the peace process and </p><p>the Oslo accord.  And while the Palestinians argue </p><p>about `reform\' and `elections\', Sharon\'s occupation </p><p>becomes a reality covered up by the United States and </p><p>met with international silence.  Sharon\'s thugs defend </p><p>their continuous invasions and mass arrests in the </p><p>West Bank as actions to stop `terrorist\' operations. </p><p>Yet, these operations are within the context.  They </p><p>are a humble response to an occupation that is </p><p>determined to impose its hegemony on a besieged </p><p>people." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Division about martyrdom operations" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(05/28):  "In principle, these operations cannot be </p><p>considered a routine aspect of a liberation movement. </p><p>A suicide bombing in a facility for young men, women </p><p>and children will only be viewed as a brutal action, </p><p>and thus cannot be supported or justified before the </p><p>world.  However, in some instances they can explained </p><p>and in turn push for a balanced international pressure </p><p>to put an end to the causes and circumstances.  When </p><p>Sharon is determined to use his military power to </p><p>crush the Palestinian people and destroy them, that </p><p>crushed and unarmed party has no other choice to </p><p>respond to this brutality except by similar brutality. </p><p>The suicide bombings represent a sensitive and serious </p><p>issue.  They must be made to be linked, in the eyes of </p><p>public opinion, with the idea of a response to Israeli </p><p>brutality." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
