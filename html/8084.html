<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 001118 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, YE, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: BAATHIST PARTY ANIMAL RETURNS TO YEMEN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ALAN G. MISENHEIMER FOR REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C)  Qassem Salam, the Secretary General of Yemen\'s Arab </p><p>Socialist Baath Party slunk back from Baghdad in late April. </p><p>In a May 6 interview with a London Arab paper, he claimed </p><p>ROYG President Salih had recently praised Saddam Hussein as a </p><p>"brave struggler".  The MFA declares a complete mis-quote, </p><p>and insists Salam is headed for the political sunset. End </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>YEMENI BAATHIST COMES HOME </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>2. U) In a meeting on other subjects (reported septel), the </p><p>DCM queried Abul al-Saleem al-Awadhi, MFA Director of the </p><p>Americas Desk, about statements made by Qassem Salam, </p><p>secretary-general of Yemen\'s Arab Socialist Baath Party (the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Iraqi,as opposed to Syrian, wing of the party).  Qassem </p><p>Salam, who was resident in Iraq, fled Baghdad on April 12. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Salam\'s May 6 interview with London\'s Al-Arab </p><p>al-Alamiyah  gained some local and international media </p><p>attention when he claimed knowledge that Saddam Hussein was </p><p>still alive, preparing to organize "tough, decisive, </p><p>historic" resistance to coalition forces, </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) While these delusions may be Salam\'s last gasp at </p><p>attention, he also referred to a meeting he had with ROYG </p><p>President Ali Abdullah Salih after returning from Baghdad. </p><p>Salam claimed that President Salih was, Quote: pained by what </p><p>happened...and stressed his conviction that Saddam Hussain </p><p>was a brave and generous struggler...however, like any other </p><p>leader, he had his mistakes and positive points. End Quote. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>NOT BRAVE, NOT GENEROUS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>5. (C)  When the DCM asked for clarification of these </p><p>remarks, al-Awadhi quickly responded that they were </p><p>inaccurate.  President Salih had not praised Saddam Hussain, </p><p>although he may well be pained by the situation of the Iraqi </p><p>people. Qassem Salam had misinterpreted his words.  In </p><p>addition, the President had received Qassem Salam only as the </p><p>Secretary General of a registered political party that was </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>fielding candidates in Yemen\'s approaching parliamentary </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The DCM pointed out that the presidential meeting had </p><p>given Salam both prestige and opportunities for mischief, </p><p>al-Awadhi assured him that it was unlikely to be repeated. </p><p>The Iraqi wing of the Baath Socialist party had not won a </p><p>single seat in the elections, and Salam would soon fade away. </p><p> After a short nostalgic review of the Baath Party\'s long ago </p><p>days of intellectual respectability under party founder </p><p>Michel Aflaq, Al Awadhi reiterated his point: President Salih </p><p>is not at all "pained" by the fate of Saddam Hussain. </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>6.  (c) Qassem Salam is a fading figure, and his quotes </p><p>regarding President Salih\'s views on Saddam\'s moral character </p><p>were never credible.  Nevertheless, we believe it was </p><p>worthwhile to remind the ROYG that the USG will be paying </p><p>attention to the fate of the (never terribly relevant) Iraqi </p><p>Baath Party in Yemen.  We predict Qassem Salam will not be </p><p>meeting again soon with President Salih or finding a </p><p>political spotlight in Yemen. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
