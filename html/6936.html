(U) This cable is classified by Ambassador </p><p>Marcelle Wahba for Reasons 1.5(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  War coverage dominates most UAE </p><p>print and electronic media, whether state-owned or </p><p>private.  Because of the federal structure of the UAE, </p><p>virtually all state-owned media are owned by the </p><p>governments of the individual emirates, not by the UAE </p><p>federal government.  On balance so far, UAE state- </p><p>owned media have sought to strike a balance between </p><p>the anti-war sentiments of the population and the </p><p>danger of losing their audience and market share. </p><p>While they have occasionally crossed the line of what </p><p>is deemed acceptable by U.S. standards, there is not a </p><p>pattern of incitement.  The star to date has been Abu </p><p>Dhabi Television, which has stolen the show from Al- </p><p>Jazeera in war coverage, and which is making a major </p><p>effort to counter the more strident tone of other UAE </p><p>media.  The other state-owned media outlets are far </p><p>less influential.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Ownership </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Except for the Emirates News Agency, which </p><p>reports to the federal Ministry of Information, state- </p><p>owned media organizations in the UAE are owned by </p><p>individual emirates, the leadership of which loosely </p><p>determines their editorial direction and tone of </p><p>reporting.  State-owned media outlets are: </p><p> </p><p>-- Federal:  Emirates News Agency (WAM), the </p><p>government wire service, which provides coverage of </p><p>local and government news to all media outlets in the </p><p>UAE.  WAM is closely controlled by the Ministry of </p><p>Information and its head Ibrahim Al-Abed reports </p><p>direct to the Minister.  It controls indirectly, </p><p>through its content and other mechanisms, the tone of </p><p>reporting in UAE media, even privately owned ones. </p><p> </p><p>-- Abu Dhabi Emirate:  Emirates Media Incorporated </p><p>(EMI), majority-owned by the government of Abu Dhabi </p><p>Emirate; comprising Abu Dhabi Television (with two </p><p>channels), Abu Dhabi Radio, Al-Ittihad Arabic-language </p><p>daily, and several magazines.  EMI comes under the </p><p>direction of the Ministry of Information, which is </p><p>headed by Shaykh Abdulla Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, UAE </p><p>Minister of Information and Culture and son of UAE </p><p>President Shaykh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan. </p><p> </p><p>-- Dubai Emirate:  Dubai Information Department, a </p><p>part of the government of Dubai Emirate, oversees </p><p>Dubai Radio and Television (four channels) and Al- </p><p>Bayan Arabic-language daily. </p><p> </p><p>-- Sharjah Emirate:  Sharjah Television (one satellite </p><p>channel) and Radio are owned by the government of </p><p>Sharjah Emirate. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Abu Dhabi TV Moves Aggressively to Counter Al-Jazeera </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Of all these outlets, by far the most </p><p>influential is Abu Dhabi Television (ADTV).  From long </p><p>before the outbreak of hostilities, ADTV sought to </p><p>position itself in the forefront, aggressively seeking </p><p>out cooperative arrangements with other media outlets </p><p>to share footage and equipment, and requesting from </p><p>the USG and UK that its reporters be embedded with </p><p>front-line units to get accurate coverage.  Since the </p><p>war began, MinInfo Shaykh Abdulla Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan </p><p>has taken a lead role in pushing the station to the </p><p>forefront of war coverage and in seeking to use it to </p><p>counter the negative and distorted coverage purveyed </p><p>by Al-Jazeera.  He monitors news coverage around the </p><p>clock, contacting the U.S. Ambassador when ADTV\'s </p><p>reporters are not getting needed access or footage, </p><p>and emphasizing the importance he and the UAEG place </p><p>on achieving moderate balanced coverage.  The results </p><p>have been excellent; ADTV has gained audience </p><p>throughout the region at the expense of Al-Jazeera; </p><p>its feed is being carried by news outlets worldwide, </p><p>and its reporting from Baghdad is essential now that </p><p>CNN is no longer there. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Competition is Stiff </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Although ADTV has, according to many of our </p><p>contacts, moved up into a lead position, deft </p><p>maneuvering is required to stay there lest its </p><p>audience defect to one of the many alternatives now </p><p>available to UAE viewers, especially Al-Jazeera and </p><p>Dubai-based, privately-owned Al-Arabiyya.  ADTV is </p><p>trying hard to retain the sympathies, and therefore </p><p>attention, of its audience; its news reports, while </p><p>balanced, are interspersed with images of Iraqi </p><p>casualties, interviews with commentators critical of </p><p>the war, etc.  When it was granted an interview with </p><p>SecState Powell, the station ran the interview in </p><p>full, but followed it with a 20-minute interview with </p><p>Arab League SecGen Amr Moussa in which he strongly </p><p>condemned the war. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>A Cautionary Tale </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Since the conflict began, Al-Ittihad Arabic- </p><p>language daily (owned by the government of Abu Dhabi </p><p>Emirate) has also tried to provide a moderate </p><p>counterbalance to the strident reporting of private </p><p>newspapers such as Sharjah-based Al-Khaleej Arabic- </p><p>language daily, which carried lurid photos of Iraqi </p><p>civilian casualties and numerous editorials and op-eds </p><p>denouncing the war and U.S. foreign policy generally. </p><p>The results have been disastrous; Al-Ittihad\'s </p><p>distributor called the editor last week to inform him </p><p>that sales had plummeted to all-time lows and no one </p><p>was buying the paper.  (Circulation is 45,000 in good </p><p>times).  As a result, the coverage in Al-Ittihad has </p><p>turned slightly more negative and war-focused, though </p><p>it is still well within the bounds of acceptable and </p><p>it gives ample coverage to statements of USG </p><p>officials, CENTCOM briefings, and commentators both </p><p>for and against the war. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Dubai </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Although Dubai Television (DTV) has four </p><p>satellite channels, its influence is largely confined </p><p>to Dubai and the UAE.  It strives to be balanced in </p><p>reporting, though it has given substantial airtime to </p><p>those with anti-war views.  Program Director Nasib </p><p>Bitar told Post that DTV is "trying hard to be as </p><p>objective as we can, so as not to incite people\'s </p><p>feelings and to report objectively."  The difficulties </p><p>of balancing good reporting with popular sentiments, </p><p>however, are illustrated by an op-ed in Dubai-based </p><p>Al-Bayan Arabic-daily on 3/29, in which UAE columnist </p><p>Maryam Al-Numaymi writes:  "The objectivity of which </p><p>our information media are so proud today in covering </p><p>the war in Iraq is a sign of weakness to be held </p><p>against them, not something deserving praise and </p><p>esteem."  Al-Bayan\'s soft-news supplement on 3/29 was </p><p>devoted mostly to opinion pieces critical of the war, </p><p>many of them taken from western newspapers.  Al- </p><p>Bayan\'s war coverage is generally factual, though like </p><p>the private press, it occasionally headlines </p><p>statements by Iraqi officials as fact rather than </p><p>allegations, noting their attribution within the body </p><p>of the article. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Sharjah </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Sharjah TV\'s one channel, which usually </p><p>focuses on local events and talk shows with a </p><p>religious focus, has in the last two weeks carried </p><p>more news and talk shows focusing on analysis of the </p><p>war and local opposition to it.  Its coverage has </p><p>occasionally crossed the bounds of the acceptable; for </p><p>example, it refers to the US as "invaders" (Arabic </p><p>"ghuzat").  Sharjah TV\'s audience is very limited. </p><p>Post is not able to monitor it consistently because of </p><p>the number of media outlets here. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Widening the Gap </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  In our conversations with both </p><p>journalists and officials, we hear repeatedly the </p><p>comment that this war is widening the gap between the </p><p>UAE government and the people, and that attempts to </p><p>control the media illustrate how wide the gap has </p><p>grown and the discomfort of the UAE leadership in </p><p>dealing with it.  State-owned media are attempting to </p><p>bridge this gap by focusing on images of the suffering </p><p>of Iraqi civilians, anti-war demonstrations in other </p><p>countries (there have been very few here), and </p><p>covering local fund-raising campaigns for humanitarian </p><p>aid for the Iraqis.  They also run numerous wire </p><p>service reports and commentaries from the western </p><p>press critical of the war and U.S. policy in the </p><p>region.  They walk a fine line between reflecting </p><p>popular feelings about the war and alienating their </p><p>audiences completely.  Just how difficult this is, is </p><p>illustrated by a story we heard from the head of the </p><p>Emirates News Agency.  He was called last week by </p><p>MinInfo Shaykh Abdulla, who asked him how to get the </p><p>newspapers to tone down their coverage of the conflict </p><p>so that it would not incite popular feeling.  (He </p><p>volunteered with alacrity that the Undersecretary of </p><p>the Ministry do this, not him.) Given the difficulty </p><p>the government already faces in containing popular </p><p>anger about the war, as well as its efforts to keep </p><p>coverage within the pale, any further attempt to </p><p>restrict media coverage may be unwelcome. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
