Under headline "MPs call for Blair to resign: Bush </p><p>      hangs British PM out to dry over Iraqi nuclear </p><p>      claims" the government-controlled daily "The Herald" </p><p>      (07/17) carried the following opinion article by </p><p>      Chris Marsden on page 9: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "In admitting U. S. doubts over British intelligence </p><p>      reports concerning Iraqi weapons of mass destruction </p><p>      (WMD), the Bush administration has deepened the </p><p>      political crisis of British Prime Minister Tony </p><p>      Blair.  In particular, Blair has been hit by recent </p><p>      statements from Washington distancing Bush from </p><p>      British reports, exposed months ago as having been </p><p>      based on forged documents, of Iraqi efforts to </p><p>      purchase uranium from Niger. . .The willingness of </p><p>      top Bush personnel to hang Blair out to dry in order </p><p>      to save their own necks is a painful reminder for </p><p>      the Prime Minister of the true value attached by the </p><p>      U. S. to the so-called `special relationship.\'  It </p><p>      has been made clear to Blair that whereas he is </p><p>      considered a useful ally, he is still expendable. </p><p>      The lesson in political duplicity provided by the </p><p>      Bush administration could not have come at a worse </p><p>      time for Blair.  It has placed his very political </p><p>      survival in question, with demands being made for </p><p>      his resignation in the face of the continued failure </p><p>      to find any evidence of Iraqi WMDs. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
