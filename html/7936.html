REASON: 1.5 (B)( </p><p>D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  DURING A WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION ON MAY </p><p>2 ABOUT THE CURRENT - AND FUTURE - STATE OF US/EU RELATIONS </p><p>AND PRIORITIES FOR THE UPCOMING ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY, MFA </p><p>DIRGEN GIANCARLO ARAGONA TOLD VISITING USEU AMBASSADOR </p><p>SCHNABEL THAT HE IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF US/EU </p><p>RELATIONS.  HIS VIEW IS THAT EUROPE\'S BIGGEST WORRY IS THAT </p><p>THE US BECOMES "INDIFFERENT" TOWARDS TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS. </p><p> HE ENCOURAGED WASHINGTON TO USE EXCELLENT GOI/USG RELATIONS </p><p>TO ITS ADVANTAGE DURING THE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ARAGONA SAID THAT THE STATE OF TRANSATLANTIC </p><p>RELATIONS WAS UPPERMOST ON HIS AGENDA RECENTLY, NOTING </p><p>RECENT PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH U/S GROSSMAN AND A/S JONES ON </p><p>JUST THAT SUBJECT; MORE SPECIFICALLY, ON HOW TO USE THE </p><p>ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY TO PUT TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS BACK ON </p><p>THE RIGHT TRACK.  "IT WON\'T BE EASY" ADMITTED ARAGONA.  ALL </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES AGREE IN PRINCIPLE THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN </p><p>AMERICA AND EUROPE CAN\'T CONTINUE AS THEY EXIST NOW.  BUT </p><p>HOW, IN PRACTICE, TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE OF MORE AMICABLE </p><p>RELATIONS IN THE POLITICAL ARENA IS LESS CLEAR.  ARAGONA </p><p>SUGGESTED STARTING WITH THE AREAS WHERE THE EU AND US ALREADY </p><p>SHARE COMMON GOALS - A NATO ROLE IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, AND CONCURRENT "LOOSENING" OF NATO\'S GEOGRAPHIC </p><p>FOCUS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AMBASSADOR SCHNABEL OBSERVED THAT THE VIEW AMONG SOME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01992  01 OF 02  090728Z </p><p>IN EUROPE, PARTICULARLY IN FRANCE, WAS THAT THE NEW US POLICY </p><p>TOWARDS EUROPE IS "DIVIDE AND CONQUER."  ARAGONA DISAGREES </p><p>WITH THIS VIEW.  HE OPINED THAT THE TRUE PROBLEM WAS A </p><p>PERCEPTION AMONG EUROPEANS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A DECREASE IN </p><p>THE "CENTRALITY" OF EUROPE IN US FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES, </p><p>AN OUTGROWTH OF POST-COLD WAR REALITIES, WHICH HAS CREATED A </p><p>DISTANCE BETWEEN THE EU AND US. ARAGONA SURMISED THAT THE </p><p>GREATEST FEAR IN EUROPE WAS NOT GROWING ANTI-EUROPEAN </p><p>SENTIMENT IN THE US, BUT RATHER "INDIFFERENCE," THE FEAR THAT </p><p>EUROPE WILL LOSE ITS IMPORTANCE THROUGH "POLITICAL NEGLECT" </p><p>IN THE US, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR RELATIONS TO GET BACK TO </p><p>NORMAL AFTER AMERICANS OVERCOME THEIR PRESENT RESENTMENT </p><p>TOWARDS EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AMB. SCHNABEL OBSERVED THAT THE US/EU SHOULD FOCUS ON </p><p>TRADE/ECONOMY, AS EACH OTHER\'S LARGEST TRADING PARTNERS, </p><p>WHERE THERE WAS FAR MORE TO AGREE UPON THAN NOT - FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, ECONOMIC AND TRADE COMPETITION FROM CHINA, WHERE </p><p>THERE IS FAR LESS OVERHEAD AND REGULATION.  ARAGONA AGREED, </p><p>BUT INSISTED THAT THE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK IS FUNDAMENTAL. </p><p>CONFLICT MAY BE SEEN AS HEALTHY AND NORMAL WITHIN A </p><p>PARTNERSHIP, BUT IF THAT PARTNERSHIP WEAKENS, CONFLICT </p><p>THREATENS ITS EXISTENCE.   EACH SIDE MUST ENCOURAGE EUROPEAN </p><p>GROWTH, BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE. </p><p> ITALY HAS A LONG COMMITMENT TO EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT IN A </p><p>MANNER THAT PRESERVES AND ENHANCES TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS. </p><p>THIS WILL BE A PRIORITY OF THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  ARAGONA SAID THAT OVERALL HE WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE </p><p>FUTURE, BUT ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS "NOT AN EASY MOMENT" IN </p><p>EU/US RELATIONS. THE GOI INTENDED TO DO WHAT IT COULD DURING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01992  01 OF 02  090728Z </p><p>ITS PRESIDENCY TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION, AND HE ASKED FOR A </p><p>STRONG US RESPONSE AND INPUT TO THE PROCESS.  HE ENCOURAGED </p><p>WASHINGTON TO USE EXCELLENT US/ITALIAN BILATERAL RELATIONS TO </p><p>ITS ADVANTAGE DURING THOSE SIX MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ON THE CONVENTION/CONSTITUTION, ARAGONA SAID THAT THE </p><p>GOAL OF ALL EU MEMBER STATES IS TO OPEN THE </p><p>INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE DURING THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY, </p><p>AND TO CLOSE IT AS WELL, BUT ADMITTEDLY TIME IS TIGHT.  THE </p><p>GOI WANTS TO AVOID JUDGING THE SUCCESS OF ITS PRESIDENCY </p><p>SOLELY ON COMPLETING A CONSTITUTION.  EVEN IF DELIBERATIONS </p><p>CARRY OVER INTO THE IRISH PRESIDENCY, ARAGONA CLAIMED THAT </p><p>THERE WERE GROWING SIGNALS FROM OTHER EU MEMBERS THAT THERE </p><p>COULD STILL BE A SIGNING CEREMONY IN ROME. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  ARAGONA SAID THAT THE GOI WAS SATISFIED WITH THE </p><p>CONVENTION DEBATE THUS FAR, BUT THERE WAS SOME ROOM FOR </p><p>IMPROVEMENT.  THE GOI IS STRONGLY COMMITTED TO EUROPEAN </p><p>INTEGRATION.  IT REJECTS DOMESTIC CRITICISM (NOTE: MOSTLY </p><p>EMANATING FROM THE ITALIAN LEFT AND AIMED AT THE CURRENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT) THAT EQUATES DEFENDING NATIONAL POSITIONS WITH A </p><p>WEAKENING COMMITMENT TO EUROPE.  NO ONE CRITICIZES FRANCE, </p><p>THE UK OR GERMANY FOR ASSERTIVE DEFENSE OF THEIR INTERESTS </p><p>WITHIN THE EU FRAMEWORK.
