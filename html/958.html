<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 009055 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09/18/09 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, MOPS, PINR, PREL, TU, SY, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  ARMY CHIEF WARNS SYRIA ABOUT SUPPORT FOR PKK </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) ANKARA 8898, (B) ANKARA 8522 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARK R. PARRIS, EMBASSY </p><p>ANKARA.  REASON:  1.5 (A), (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  TURKISH LAND FORCES COMMAND (TLFC) COMMANDER </p><p>GENERAL ATILLA ATES WAS QUOTED IN THE LOCAL PRESS SEPTEMBER </p><p>16 AS SAYING THAT TURKEY WAS "RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE" WITH </p><p>SYRIA\'S ALLEGED SUPPORT OF THE SEPARATIST/TERRORIST </p><p>KURDISTAN WORKERS PARTY (PKK).  THE CONSERVATIVE "TURKIYE" </p><p>NEWSPAPER\'S IHA NEWS AGENCY REPORTED ATES AS ASSERTING THAT </p><p>BY "SUPPORTING THE `BANDIT\' APO (PKK LEADER ABDULLAH </p><p>OCALAN)," SYRIA HAD "CONTAMINATED TURKEY WITH THE CALAMITY </p><p>OF TERRORISM."  HE WARNED THAT TURKEY "HAD NO MORE PATIENCE </p><p>LEFT." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ATES\'S COMMENTS WERE ALL THE MORE POINTED BECAUSE </p><p>THEY WERE DELIVERED DURING A VISIT TO TROOPS IN HATAY </p><p>PROVINCE, SOVEREIGNTY OVER WHICH SYRIA CLAIMS AND WHICH IS </p><p>THEREFORE A MAJOR IRRITANT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN ANKARA AND </p><p>DAMASCUS.  ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL OF THE TURKISH GENERAL </p><p>STAFF (TGS), WHO SPOKE WITH EMBASSY CONTACTS SEPTEMBER 18, TGS\' </p><p>SENIOR LEADERSHIP DECIDED THAT A PUBLIC WARNING TO SYRIA ABOUT </p><p>THE PKK WAS LONG OVERDUE.  THE FACT THAT IT WAS DELIVERED BY ARMY </p><p>CHIEF ATES IN HATAY UNDERSCORED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE MESSAGE </p><p>BEHIND IT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  IN THREE SEPARATE CONTACTS SEPTEMBER 17, MFA U/S </p><p>HAKTANIR AND TWO OTHER SENIOR MFA OFFICIALS LIKEWISE </p><p>REITERATED THAT TURKEY IS "OUT OF PATIENCE" WITH SYRIA, AND </p><p>THAT THE DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES OF EARLIER THIS YEAR HAD "COME </p><p>TO A STOP." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  COMMENT:  IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE TURKS ARE LAYING </p><p>OUT A GROUNDWORK OF DIPLOMATIC AND PUBLIC WARNINGS TO DAMASCUS TO </p><p>PROVIDE A RATIONALE FOR AN EVENTUAL DECISION ON A MILITARY </p><p>RESPONSE TO PKK ACTIVITY IN SYRIA.  SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THEY </p><p>HAVE USED RECALLS OUR POST FACTO JUSTIFICATION OF OUR CRUISE </p><p>MISSILE ATTACKS ON OSAMA BIN LADEN FACILITIES LAST MONTH.  WE </p><p>HAVE NO INDICATION A DECISION TO ACTUALLY CARRY OUT AN ATTACK HAS </p><p>BEEN REACHED.  WE RECOMMEND U.S.INTELLIGENCE ATTENTION TO </p><p>INDICATIONS OF TURKISH MILITARY AND PKK ACTIVITY IN THE </p><p>SYRIAN-TURKISH BORDER REGION, AS WELL AS THE BEKAA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARRIS </p><p></p></div>
