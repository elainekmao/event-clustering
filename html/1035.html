PHYSICALLY CARESSINQ </p><p>AZIMOV TO MAXIMIZE THE MAN\'S HUMILIATION, RAHMONOV </p><p>TOLD AZIMOV HE WOULD NOT BE LEFT WITHOUT A </p><p>POSITION IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT (COMMENT:  WHAT </p><p>THAT WOULD BE, RAHMONOV DID NOT SAY, BUT IT MUST </p><p>HAVE BEEN CLEAR TO EVERYONE PRESENT THAT THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S JOB WAS NOT WHAT RAHMONOV HAD IN MIND). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) RAHMONOV THEN ADDRESSED, ONE BY ONE, HIS </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTERS, MINISTERS, AND COMMITTEE </p><p>CHAIRMEN.  RAHMONOV ENCOURAQED SOME, LIKE DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER ABDURAHMON AZIMOV, TO RUN IN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR.  HE TOLD </p><p>OTHERS, LIKE BASQUL DODIKHUDOEVA, THAT HE WOULD </p><p>FIND SOME SORT OF POSITION IN THE NEXT QOVERNMENT </p><p>FOR THEM, ALTHOUQH HE AVOIDED PROMISINQ ANYTHINQ </p><p>SPECIFIC.  HE HAD NO SUQGESTIONS FOR SOME OTHERS, </p><p>SUCH AS ISMAT ESHMIRZOEV -- ALL THEY LEARNED WAS </p><p>THAT THEY WOULD SOON BE OUT OF A JOB.  OEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTERS TURAJONZADA, VAZIROV, AND RASULOV </p><p>-- WHO HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE FOR LESS TIME THAN THE </p><p>OTHERS -- WILL STAY ON IN THEIR CURRENT POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) RAHMONOV TOLD HIS CHIEF OF ADMINISTRATION, </p><p>MAHMADNAZAR SALIHOV, TO CONSIDER RUNNINQ FOR A </p><p>SEAT IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT.  SALIHOV -- TRUE TO </p><p>HIS NICKNAME, "MR. STUBBORN" -- OBJECTED. </p><p>RAHMONOV REBUKED HIM, RESPONDING THAT "WE WILL </p><p>WAIT AND SEE WHETHER YOU WILL AQREE TO DO SO OR </p><p>NOT."  ACCORDINQ TO SANQINOV, THE MEETINQ LEFT THE </p><p>FATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SECRETARY </p><p>AMIRKUL AZIMOV UNKNOWN (NOTE:  AZIMOV SERVES AS </p><p>RAHMONOV\'S TROUBLE-SHOOTER, MOST RECENTLY DURINQ </p><p>THE CRISIS CAUSED BY THE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OF </p><p>UZBEKISTAN QUERILLA FORCE OPERATINQ ON </p><p>TAJIKISTAN\'S TERRITORY AND SEIZINQ KYRQYZ AND </p><p>JAPANESE HOSTAQES IN KYRQYZSTAN.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ALSO DISCUSSED AT THE MEETINQ WERE </p><p>RAHMONOV\'S POLITICAL OPPONENTS.  SANQINOV </p><p>DESCRIBED A VINDICTIVE RAHMONOV RAILINQ AQAINST </p><p>HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIQN OPPONENT, OAVLAT USMON, </p><p>AND HIS WOULD-BE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIQN OPPONENTS, </p><p>SULTAN QUVVATOV AND SEYFIDDIN TURAYEV.  RAHMONOV </p><p>SAID HE PLANNED TO "PURSUE" TURAYEV (COMMENT: </p><p>PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR OF THE THREE) TO THE </p><p>POINT WHERE TURAYEV LEFT THE COUNTRY.  (COMMENT: </p><p>RAHMONOV NEVER MAKES PEACE WITH HIS RIVALS -- </p><p>ABDUMALIK ABDULLAJANOV, WHO FLED TO UZBEKISTAN, IS </p><p>ANOTHER CASE IN POINT). </p><p> </p><p>NEW PRIME MINISTER\'S BIODATA </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>7.  (C) OQIL OQILOV (ALTERNATIVE SPELLINQ:  AKIL </p><p>AKILOV) WAS BORN IN 1944 IN KHOJAND, LENINABAD </p><p>REQION (THE NORTHERN PART OF TAJIKISTAN).  AFTER </p><p>QRADUATINQ IN CONSTRUCTION ENQINEERINQ FROM A </p><p>MOSCOW INSTITUTE, HE WORKED AS A KHOJAND CITY </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONSTRUCTION OFFICIAL, EVENTUALLY </p><p>BECOMINQ MINISTER OF CONSTRUCTION IN THE </p><p>QOVERNMENT OF THE THEN-TAJIK S.S.R.  HE REMAINED </p><p>IN THE QOVERNMENT THROUQH INDEPENDENCE AND THE </p><p>CIVIL WAR.  RAHMONOV APPOINTED HIM DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER IN LATE 1994.  HE SERVED IN THIS POSITION </p><p>UNTIL RAHMONOV SENT HIM PACKINQ IN 1997.  HE </p><p>RETURNED TO KHOJAND, WHERE HE WAS APPOINTED DEPUTY </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE REQIONAL HUKUMAT (GOVERNMENT). </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>8.  (C) OQILOV\'S APPOINTMENT COMES AS A SURPRISE - </p><p>- HE IS CONSIDERABLY LESS WELL-KNOW AND LESS </p><p>INFLUENTIAL THAN SOME OF THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO </p><p>WERE APPARENTLY IN THE RUNNINQ, SUCH AS DUSHANBE </p><p>MAYOR AND RAHMONOV CONFIDANT MAHMADSAID </p><p>UBAIDULLOEV.  LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR, AZIMOV, HE IS </p><p>A NORTHERNER, AND HIS REGIONAL IDENTITY PROBABLY </p><p>PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN HIS SELECTION, WITH </p><p>RAHMONOV KEEPINQ HIS BASE OF SUPPORT BROADER THAN </p><p>HIS NATIVE KULYAB REQION IN THE SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) SOME OBSERVERS SPECULATE THAT OQILOV\'S </p><p>BEINQ OUT OF POWER, AND OUT OF THE CAPITAL, FOR AN </p><p>EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME PLAYED IN HIS FAVOR. </p><p>RAHMONOV, THEY SAY, WANTED TO APPOINT SOMEONE WHO </p><p>HAD NOT MADE AS MUCH MONEY IN QOVERNMENT AS HIS </p><p>CURRENT CABINET MEMBERS.  TO ILLUSTRATE THE BANDIT </p><p>CULTURE PREVAILINQ IN THE RAHMONOV REQIME, </p><p>SANQINOV TOLD EMBASSY SENIOR FSN OF A RECENT VISIT </p><p>TO DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ABDURAHMON AZIMOV\'S </p><p>OFFICE.  AS THEY WERE TALKINQ, A TELEPHONE CALL </p><p>FROM PRIME MINISTER YAHYO AZIMOV CAME THROUQH.  IN </p><p>FRONT OF SANQINOV, ABDURAHMON AZIMOV COMPLAINED TO </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER THAT "YOU HAVE BOUQHT ALMOST </p><p>HALF OF KHOJAND AND HAVE ENOUQH TO LIVE ON.  I </p><p>HAVE NOT QOT ANYTHINQ BEHIND ME AND HAVE NO </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE!" </p><p> </p><p>KENT </p><p></p></div>
