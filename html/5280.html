<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 04 ZAGREB 000167 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR (DAS BOGUE), EUR/SCE, EUR/ERA AND PRM </p><p>USNATO FOR MOELLER AND DEHART </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00167  04 OF 04  231842Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, HR, EUN, UN, NATO, UNHCR, Refugee </p><p>SUBJECT: REFUGEE RETURNS:  RATCHETING UP IC PRESSURE ON </p><p>CROATIA </p><p> </p><p>ON 9 OCTOBER 2002, WE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING AS A GROUP </p><p>WITH YOU TO SHARE OUR CONCERNS ABOUT ISSUES RELATING TO SOME </p><p>OF CROATIA\'S INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS WHERE WE BELIEVED </p><p>FURTHER DECISIONS HAD TO BE TAKEN OR IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>STRENGTHENED IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROGRESS TOWARDS </p><p>EURO-ATLANTIC INTEGRATION. WE STRESSED OUR COMMITMENT TO A </p><p>COLLABORATIVE EFFORT THAT WOULD USE OUR INSTITUTIONS\' </p><p>RESOURCES TO ASSIST YOUR GOVERNMENT IN ENSURING THAT </p><p>LEGISLATION AND IMPLEMENTATION WOULD FURTHER THAT IMPORTANT </p><p>OBJECTIVE. WE APPRECIATED YOUR POSITIVE RESPONSE ON THAT </p><p>OCCASION, PARTICULARLY YOUR STATED DESIRE TO MEET FOR </p><p>THEMATIC DISCUSSIONS WITH US SOON AFTERWARDS. </p><p> </p><p>WE FOLLOWED UP BY A LETTER ON 14 NOVEMBER, PROPOSING A </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE ACTION-ORIENTED MEETING ON A CORE ISSUE, REFUGEE </p><p>RETURN AND REINTEGRATION. IN THE POSITIVE SPIRIT OF OUR </p><p>OCTOBER DISCUSSION, WE SUGGESTED FRAMING THAT </p><p>DISCUSSION IN THE CONTEXT OF A TOP-LEVEL PUSH TO REINVIGORATE </p><p>THE JOINED LEGAL WORKING GROUP (JLWG). SUCH AN IMPETUS WAS </p><p>NEEDED BECAUSE THE GROUP HAD SUFFERED FROM INADEQUATE </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL ENDORSEMENT. SINCE WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY </p><p>RESPONSE MORE THAN TWO MONTHS LATER, WE FEEL COMPELLED TO </p><p>PRESENT SOME FURTHER THOUGHTS </p><p>IN THE FORM OF THIS LETTER. EACH OF US HAS ATTRIBUTED GREAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00167  04 OF 04  231842Z </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE TO THE JLWG. USED PROPERLY, THE </p><p>GROUP COULD BE INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING A COMMON VIEW, </p><p>CATALYZING ACTIONS OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THE </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THEREBY MOVING </p><p>CROATIA\'S EURO-ATLANTIC ASPIRATIONS FORWARD MORE QUICKLY. THE </p><p>JLWG HAS BEEN CITED POSITIVELY FOR THE LAST 18 MONTHS IN </p><p>VARIOUS ASSESSMENTS OF CROATIA\'S EFFORTS IN THE RETURN AND </p><p>REINTEGRATION AREA. THAT IS ONLY MERITED, HOWEVER, IF THE </p><p>GROUP IS GIVEN A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON RELEVANT </p><p>LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. </p><p> </p><p>YOUR GOVERNMENT GAVE A NEGATIVE SIGNAL IN THE MEANTIME, WHEN </p><p>IT RECENTLY ADOPTED THREE DRAFT LAWS ON STATE COMPENSATION </p><p>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING A PROPOSAL INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE </p><p>ISSUE OF PARLIAMENT\'S 1996 RETROACTIVE </p><p>SUSPENSION OF PENDING JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE 180 </p><p>OF THE LAW ON OBLIGATIONS, WITHOUT ENGAGING THE JLWG. THESE </p><p>MATTERS HAD BEEN ON THE JLWG\'S AGENDA SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN </p><p>MID-2001, AND THEY WERE LISTED AS ISSUES OF CONCERN IN OUR </p><p>LETTER OF 14 NOVEMBER. WE CANNOT ENDORSE YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>PROPOSAL, SINCE THE DRAFT LEGISLATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY </p><p>REMEDY FOR PERSONS WITH SUSPENDED AND PENDING CLAIMS FOR </p><p>DESTROYED PROPERTY. PRIOR DISCUSSION IN THE JLWG COULD HAVE </p><p>ENSURED THAT THE DRAFT LAWS WOULD HAVE MET INTERNATIONAL </p><p>STANDARDS. </p><p> </p><p>WE REGRET THE FAILURE OF THE CROATIAN SIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF THE POSSIBILITIES OFFERED BY THE JLWG. PENDING RENEWAL OF </p><p>A CLEAR GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT TO THE JLWG ALONG THE LINES </p><p>THAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED, WE THEREFORE DO NOT FIND IT USEFUL TO </p><p>CONVENE FURTHER MEETINGS OF THE GROUP. MEANWHILE, WE WILL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00167  04 OF 04  231842Z </p><p>CONTINUE TO SEEK CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS TO SHARE OUR VIEWS WITH </p><p>YOUR OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>WE WILL REPORT TO OUR CAPITALS AND HEADQUARTERS OF OUR </p><p>INABILITY TO BRING ABOUT A FRUITFUL DIALOGUE AND MEANINGFUL </p><p>PROGRESS ON THE LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE IMPEDIMENTS TO </p><p>RETURN AND REINTEGRATION. THIS WILL BE REFLECTED IN </p><p>FORTHCOMING ASSESSMENTS OF CROATIA\'S PROGRESS WITHIN THE </p><p>STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION PROCESS WITH THE EU AND THE </p><p>MEMBERSHIP ACTION PLAN WITH NATO, AS WELL AS IN REPORTING BY </p><p>THE OSCE, AND WILL SHAPE OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS ON RETURN AND </p><p>REINTEGRATION IN CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>CROATIA\'S PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP </p><p>WILL BE CONDITIONED BY ITS ENACTMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT FACILITATE RETURN AND REINTEGRATION </p><p>AND MEET INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, AS WELL AS OTHER ISSUES </p><p>ENCOMPASSED IN THE OSCE MANDATE. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO SEIZE </p><p>THE INITIATIVE IN ORDER TO MEET THOSE OBJECTIVES.  END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
