<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 003201 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, DRL AND EB/CBA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 07/08/08 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PREL, PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, CVIS, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE CONTINUES AMNESTY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABU DHABI 2969 AND PREVIOUS </p><p>     B) ABU DHABI 945 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by A/DCM Katherine Van de Vate for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The UAEG officially claimed that 100,000 </p><p>illegal immigrants "benefited" from the amnesty which </p><p>began January 1, 2003, and that 40,000 illegals have </p><p>been arrested over the past few months. The Labor </p><p>Ministry instigated the amnesty in hopes of removing </p><p>illegal workers and establishing better control over </p><p>the UAE labor market (see ref A).  Though the amnesty </p><p>was extended until the end of June from its original </p><p>April 30 deadline, the UAEG has now officially </p><p>declared that illegals can continue to apply for exit </p><p>visas indefinitely. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment: Though the amnesty failed to live up </p><p>to expectations, the UAEG has decided to save face and </p><p>declare victory. Based on conversations with foreign </p><p>labor attaches, we reported in mid-June that </p><p>approximately 60,000 workers had departed the UAE -- </p><p>this estimate was in line with publicized official </p><p>reports at the time. In recent follow-up phone </p><p>conversations with the foreign labor attaches, all </p><p>agreed that the UAEG was exaggerating both the number </p><p>of people who departed as well as the number arrested. </p><p>By claiming to take a hard line against illegal </p><p>immigrants, but leaving the door open for departure, </p><p>the UAEG hopes that more illegals will leave the </p><p>country. However, workers do not fear getting caught - </p><p>- even though they are threatened with jail time and </p><p>financial penalties if caught, they know the reality </p><p>is that they will simply be deported.  The UAE will </p><p>not be able to control the illegal labor market via </p><p>amnesties; true reform  will only be possible when the </p><p>UAEG cracks down on UAE nationals profiting from the </p><p>"free visa" scheme (see ref B). End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
