<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 MOSCOW 10849 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SOV, C-ZOELLICK </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, UR, PREL, SOCI, PINS </p><p>SUBJECT:  BYZANTINE POLITICS THRIVE IN SOVIET GEORGIA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  MOSCOW 10336 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>/------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING A MARCH 31 - APRIL 3 TRIP TO TBILISI, </p><p>POLOFF MET WITH GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET CHAIRMAN </p><p>ZVIAD GAMSAKHURDIA (PROTECT), OPPOSITION LEADERS, AND </p><p>OTHER REPUBLIC RESIDENTS TO SORT OUT THE BYZANTINE </p><p>POLITICS OF GEORGIA WHERE ACCUSATIONS FLY FREELY, </p><p>ENEMIES ARE MADE EASILY, AND VIOLENT CONFRONTATION </p><p>OCCURS DAILY.  DURING THE PAST MONTH GAMSAKHURDIA HAS </p><p>MOVED TO CONCENTRATE MOST REPUBLIC POWERS IN HIS </p><p>HANDS THROUGH THE CREATION OF A PREFECTURE SYSTEM AND </p><p>A REPUBLIC PRESIDENCY.  GAMSAKHURDIA INSISTS THAT </p><p>SUCH STEPS ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CENTER IS </p><p>WORKING WITH HIS ENEMIES -- THE NATIONAL CONGRESS AND </p><p>THE SOUTH OSSETIANS -- TO UNDERMINE HIS GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>POSITION.  OPPOSITION LEADERS FROM THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONGRESS ACCUSE GAMSAKHURDIA OF DEPRIVING THEM OF </p><p>THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS AND WORKING WITH THE CENTER </p><p>AGAINST THE GEORGIAN PEOPLE.  VIRTUALLY ALL SIDES </p><p>CLAIM THE OTHER SIDES ARE IN CAHOOTS WITH THE KGB. </p><p>IN ADDITION, EACH SIDE, INCLUDING GAMSAKHURDIA\'S </p><p>ROUND TABLE, HAS ITS OWN PARAMILITARY GROUP OR GROUPS </p><p>WHICH LAUNCH FREQUENT ATTACKS AGAINST EACH OTHER. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THIS IS THE SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE CABLES ON </p><p>POLITICS IN SOVIET GEORGIA.  THIS FIRST REPORT (REF) </p><p>DEALT WITH GAMSAKHURDIA\'S CONFRONTATION WITH THE </p><p>CENTER AND THE SOUTH OSSETIANS.  THE THIRD WILL COVER </p><p>A TRIP POLOFF MADE TO A KGB PRISON AND A CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH THE IMPRISONED OSSETIAN LEADER KULUMBEGOV\'S </p><p>LAWYER. </p><p> </p><p>GEORGIAN POLITICS:  ETERNAL PLOTS AND COUNTER-PLOTS </p><p>/-------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  GEORGIAN POLITICS REMAIN TRUE TO THEIR BYZANTINE </p><p>HERITAGE AND APPEAR SOMEWHAT BIZARRE TO MOST </p><p>OUTSIDERS.  MOST OF THE RELATIVELY SMALL REPUBLIC\'S </p><p>LEADERS HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE CHILDHOOD AND </p><p>HAVE BUILT AN INTRICATE WEB OF FRIENDS AND ENEMIES </p><p>THROUGH THE YEARS.  GEORGIAN POLITICS ARE HIGHLY </p><p>EMOTIONAL AND LOGIC IS OFTEN CAST ASIDE IN FAVOR OF </p><p>INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC AND HIGH DRAMA.  ACCUSATIONS OF </p><p>KGB MEMBERSHIP, BETRAYAL, COLLUSION WITH MOSCOW, AND </p><p>CLINICAL INSANITY ARE TRADED WITH EQUAL VENOM FROM </p><p>ALL SIDES.  THE STORIES BECOME ENHANCED WITH TIME AND </p><p>QUICKLY TAKE THEIR PLACES IN THE TWISTED AND </p><p>BEWILDERING LORE OF GEORGIAN POLITICAL HISTORY. </p><p>POLOFF HAS VISITED THE REPUBLIC FREQUENTLY DURING THE </p><p>PAST TWO YEARS AND OCCASIONALLY DURING THE PAST </p><p>DECADE AND HAS NEVER FAILED TO BE INTRIGUED BY THE </p><p>PECULIAR BRAND OF POLITICS GEORGIANS PRACTICE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  VENDETTAS, PARTICULARLY IN RETALIATION FOR PUBLIC </p><p>CRITICISM, ARE QUITE COMMON IN GEORGIA.  GEORGIANS </p><p>ARE QUICK TO TAKE UMBRAGE AND TURN ON ANY CRITICAL </p><p>PARTIES.  THIS COMBINED WITH THE GEORGIAN FLARE FOR </p><p>DRAMA AND HYPERBOLE SOMETIMES LEAD TO RATHER </p><p>STARTLING ACCUSATIONS.  GEORGIAN POLITICAL LEADERS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY GAMSAKHURDIA, HAVE TRIED TO APPLY THESE </p><p>TACTICS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD WITH DISASTROUS PUBLIC </p><p>RELATIONS RESULTS.  GAMSAKHURDIA, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>RECENTLY LABELLED RADIO LIBERTY AND THE WALL STREET </p><p>JOURNAL "INSTRUMENTS OF THE KREMLIN" BECAUSE THEY </p><p>CRITICIZED HIM.  WHEN POLOFF POINTED OUT THAT THIS </p><p>WAS NOT EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION WITH THE KREMLIN, </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA APPEARED SURPRISED.  GAMSAKHURDIA ALSO </p><p>HAS MADE MANY OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS AGAINST HIS MAJOR </p><p>OPPOSITION, THE NATIONAL CONGRESS.  THESE CLAIMS </p><p>INCLUDE BEARING OR FATHERING ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN, </p><p>COLLUSION WITH IRAQ IN THE GULF WAR, AND OTHER </p><p>APOCRYPHAL ACCUSATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE OPPOSITION REACTS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY. </p><p>NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER GHIA CHANTURIA </p><p>(PROTECT) HAD EQUALLY OUTRAGEOUS STORIES ABOUT HOW </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA WAS ACTUALLY COLLUDING WITH THE CENTER, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE KGB, AGAINST THE GEORGIAN PEOPLE. </p><p>IN ADDITION, CHANTURIA AND HIS WIFE AMD FELLOW </p><p>POLITICAL ACTIVIST, IRINA SARISHVILI (PROTECT), WHO </p><p>WERE ONCE FELLOW DISSIDENTS WITH GAMSAKHURDIA, SHOWED </p><p>POLOFF ALLEGED OFFICIAL PROOF OF GAMSAKHURDIA\'S </p><p>INSANITY.  THE "PROOF" CONSISTED OF A "SECRET" </p><p>CERTIFICATE FROM A PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC WHERE </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA WAS CONFINED WHEN HE WAS A POLITICAL </p><p>PRISONER.  WHEN POLOFF ASKED WHERE THEY HAD OBTAINED </p><p>THESE AND OTHER DOCUMENTS, CHANTURIA REPLIED THAT </p><p>FORMER KGB MEMBERS HAD PASSED THE DOCUMENTS TO THEM </p><p>IN FRANCE LAST YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES ARE BURIED IN EACH SIDE\'S </p><p>LITANY OF ACCUSATIONS AND COMPLAINTS.  GREAT EFFORT </p><p>AND MUCH PATIENCE, HOWEVER, IS REQUIRED TO MINE THESE </p><p>NUGGETS OF TRUTH FROM THE TANGLED TERRAIN OF GEORGIAN </p><p>POLITICS.  CONSISTENCY IS NOT A HIGHLY REGARDED </p><p>VIRTUE WHEN IT COMES TO STATISTICS AND AN INTERVIEWER </p><p>WILL OFTEN RECEIVE WILDLY FLUCTUATING ESTIMATES FROM </p><p>THE SAME PERSON IN THE COURSE OF A SINGLE DAY.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, GAMSAKHURDIA ESTIMATED THE NUMBER OF </p><p>GEORGIAN MVD PERSONNEL AT 10,000 ONE MORNING AND </p><p>20,000 LATER THAT DAY.  NATIONAL CONGRESS LEADERS </p><p>EXHIBITED THE SAME CAVALIER ATTITUDE TOWARD </p><p>STATISTICS BY CHANGING THEIR ESTIMATES OF MEMBERSHIP </p><p>BY SEVERAL THOUSAND ON EACH OF THE THREE OCCASIONS </p><p>POLOFF SPOKE TO THEM DURING THE TRIP. </p><p> </p><p>SPRINGTIME FOR GAMSAKHURDIA </p><p>/-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  ON APRIL 14, GAMSAKHURDIA HELD AN EMERGENCY </p><p>SESSION OF THE GEORGIAN PARLIAMENT, WHICH CREATED A </p><p>REPUBLIC PRESIDENCY WITH SWEEPING POWERS AND </p><p>UNANIMOUSLY ELECTED GAMSAKHURDIA PRESIDENT UNTIL </p><p>REPUBLIC-WIDE ELECTIONS ON MAY 26.  DURING A </p><p>TELEPHONE CONVERSATION THAT SAME DAY, GAMSAKHURDIA </p><p>TOLD POLOFF THAT HE REQUIRED SUCH POWERS TO BRING </p><p>ORDER TO THE REPUBLIC AND ROUT THE CENTER\'S </p><p>ACCOMPLICES.  THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE PRESIDENCY, </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA HAS GAINED VIRTUALLY UNRESTRAINED </p><p>POWER.  ALTHOUGH THE REPUBLIC LAW ON THE PRESIDENCY </p><p>STIPULATES THAT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE PARLIAMENT CAN </p><p>IMPEACH HIM AT ANY TIME, GAMSAKHURDIA HAS THE PRESENT </p><p>GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET FIRMLY UNDER HIS CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  GAMSAKHURDIA WILL PROBABLY WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS ON MAY 26.  HE PROBABLY SET AN EARLY DATE </p><p>FOR THE ELECTIONS SO THAT THE FRAGMENTED OPPOSITION </p><p>WOULD NOT HAVE TIME TO PREPARE AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN. </p><p>WHILE GAMSAKHURDIA CERTAINLY HAS AUTHORITARIAN </p><p>TENDENCIES, HE IS ALSO QUITE POPULAR -- AS EVEN HIS </p><p>RIVALS WILL ADMIT.  HE IS STILL ABLE TO DRAW LARGE </p><p>CROWDS AND GEORGIANS, WHO ARE QUITE NATIONALISTIC, </p><p>REVERE HIM FOR HIS MANY YEARS AS A POLITICAL </p><p>DISSIDENT AND HIS STRONG CHALLENGES TO THE CENTER. </p><p>HIS MARCH 31 REFERENDUM ON GEORGIAN INDEPENDENCE WAS </p><p>A RESOUNDING SUCCESS AS EVEN THE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL CONGRESS PARTICIPATED AND VOTED IN FAVOR OF </p><p>REPUBLIC INDEPENDENCE.  ONE OF THE POSTERS URGING </p><p>REPUBLIC CITIZENS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REFERENDUM </p><p>BORE A PHOTOGRAPH OF GAMSAKHURDIA EXTENDING HIS ARM </p><p>FORWARD IN A CLENCHED FIST AS A SIGN OF DEFIANCE </p><p>AGAINST THE CENTER.  THE GESTURE BORE A CHILLING </p><p>RESEMBLANCE TO THE NAZI SALUTE -- A FACT THAT DID NOT </p><p>ESCAPE HIS DETRACTORS BUT EVIDENTLY DID GAMSAKHURDIA </p><p>NO HARM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  ONE OF GAMSAKHURDIA\'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>POLICIES HAS BEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SYSTEM OF </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES CALLED PREFECTURES. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THIS SYSTEM, GAMSAKHURDIA APPOINTS </p><p>PREFECTS WHO ADMINISTER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN PLACE </p><p>OF THE SOVIETS OR COUNCILS OF THE FORMER SYSTEM. </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE APPOINTED THE </p><p>FIRST GROUP OF PREFECTS IN JANUARY, HE HOPED THAT BY </p><p>NEXT YEAR THEY WOULD BE ELECTED.  HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>SOME OF THESE ELECTIONS WERE HELD AT THE SAME TIME AS </p><p>THE MARCH 31 GEORGIAN REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE APRIL 14 LAW ON THE PRESIDENCY, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE GEORGIAN PRESIDENT WILL HAVE THE POWER </p><p>TO APPOINT AND REMOVE PREFECTS.  GAMSAKHURDIA SAID HE </p><p>WOULD TRY THE SYSTEM FOR SIX MONTHS AND "IF THE </p><p>PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE IT, WE WILL GET RID OF IT." </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA  COMPARED THIS SYSTEM TO THE FRENCH AND </p><p>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS, WHICH HE SAID HE USED AS </p><p>EXAMPLES TO CREATE THE PREFECTURES.  CRITICS HAVE </p><p>ACCUSED GAMSAKHURDIA OF SETTING UP A NON-DEMOCRATIC </p><p>SYSTEM BY APPOINTING PREFECTS TO CIRCUMVENT THE LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY IN AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE </p><p>NATIONAL CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  GAMSAKHURDIA PLANS TO CONTINUE HIS PUSH FOR "THE </p><p>RENEWAL OF GEORGIA\'S INDEPENDENCE BASED ON THE 1918 </p><p>GEORGIAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE."  HE SAID HE </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS A GRADUAL BUT INEVITABLE </p><p>PROCESS.  ON APRIL 9, THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGIC </p><p>GEORGIAN DEATHS AT THE HANDS OF SOVIET TROOPS, THE </p><p>GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET OFFICIALLY DECLARED ITS </p><p>INTENTION TO RENEW ITS INDEPENDENCE BASED ON THE 1918 </p><p>DECLARATION JUST AS GAMSAKHURDIA HAD PLANNED. </p><p> </p><p>DOUBLE-SPEAK ON HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>/--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  DURING POLOFF\'S VISIT, GAMSAKHURDIA CONTINUED TO </p><p>JUSTIFY HIS SUPPRESSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, SUCH AS </p><p>FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND SPEECH, AS "NECESSARY </p><p>MEASURES" TO FIGHT THE CENTER\'S "PROVOCATION."  AT </p><p>OTHER TIMES, HE GAVE POLOFF OBVIOUSLY TRANSPARENT </p><p>EXCUSES.  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN POLOFF ASKED WHY HE HAD </p><p>CLOSED DOWN "MOLODEZH GRUZII," A NEWSPAPER CRITICAL </p><p>OF THE GEORGIAN GOVERNMENT, GAMSAKHURDIA SAID THAT </p><p>GEORGIA WAS EXPERIENCING A PAPER SHORTAGE AND </p><p>"THEREFORE, UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE NEWSPAPERS HAD </p><p>TO BE SHUT DOWN." </p><p> </p><p>13.  GAMSAKHURDIA INSISTED THAT HE WOULD ALLOW </p><p>CRITICISM OF HIMSELF AND HIS GOVERNMENT IN THE PRESS, </p><p>"BUT NOT SLANDER."  HIS DEFINITION OF "SLANDER" </p><p>SEEMED EXCESSIVELY WIDE-RANGING.  HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>CHANTURIA HAD WANTED TO PRINT ARTICLES "WITH OBSCENE </p><p>WORDS IN THEM AND OF COURSE, WE CANNOT ALLOW SUCH </p><p>THINGS."  IN REALITY, CHANTURIA HAD TRIED TO PRINT AN </p><p>ARTICLE CRITICAL OF GAMSAKHURDIA IN THE REPUBLIC </p><p>NEWSPAPER AND THE EDITOR WAS NOT ALLOWED TO PRINT </p><p>IT.  GAMSAKHURDIA ALSO SAID HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE </p><p>POLITICAL GROUPS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS SHOULD BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO PUBLISH OR SAY WHATEVER THEY WANTED </p><p>"BECAUSE THEY WOULD JUST PROVOKE VIOLENCE." </p><p> </p><p>14.  DURING THE LAST WEEK IN MARCH, THE GEORGIAN </p><p>SUPREME SOVIET PASSED A RESOLUTION BANNING </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF THE GEORGIAN SUPREME </p><p>SOVIET BUILDING.  INTERESTINGLY, THIS IS WHERE </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA HIMSELF HELD MANY LARGE RALLIES LAST </p><p>YEAR.  CHANTURIA TOLD POLOFF THAT THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA\'S PLOY TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DIRECT </p><p>POLITICAL CRITICISM OF GAMSAKHURDIA IN ONE OF THE </p><p>MOST POPULAR GATHERING PLACES IN THE CITY. </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA TOLD POLOFF THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO BAN </p><p>THE DEMONSTRATIONS ON THE BUILDING\'S GROUNDS BECAUSE </p><p>THE DEMONSTRATIONS "BLOCKED MY EXIT FROM THE BUILDING </p><p>AND I COULD NOT GO HOME BECAUSE I WAS TRAPPED.  THEY </p><p>ARE FREE TO DEMONSTRATE ANYWHERE ELSE." </p><p> </p><p>THE UNDERDOG OPPOSITION TRIES TO FIGHT BACK </p><p>/------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE MAJOR OPPOSITION, THE NATIONAL CONGRESS, </p><p>CONSISTS OF SIX BLOCKS OF ORGANIZATIONS WITH AN </p><p>AVERAGE OF TEN PARTIES IN EACH BLOCK.  MANY OF THESE </p><p>PARTIES HAVE ONLY A COUPLE HUNDRED MEMBERS.  THE </p><p>LARGEST PARTIES ARE THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, </p><p>WHICH HAS ABOUT 5000 MEMBERS, AND THE NATIONAL </p><p>INDEPENDENCE PARTY, WHICH HAS ABOUT 2000 MEMBERS. </p><p>THE NATIONAL CONGRESS HAS A MORE RADICAL APPROACH TO </p><p>ACHIEVING INDEPENDENCE THAN GAMSAKHURDIA\'S ROUND </p><p>TABLE.  THEY BELIEVE THAT GAMSAKHURDIA SHOULD TAKE AN </p><p>EVEN MORE CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH TO THE CENTER. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, DAVID ONANASHVILI (PROTECT), NATIONAL </p><p>INDEPENDENCE PARTY ACTIVIST, TOLD POLOFF THAT HIS </p><p>BLOCK OF PARTIES HAD BEEN HOLDING DEMONSTRATIONS TO </p><p>GET THE GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET TO BAN THE PRESENCE </p><p>OF ALL SOVIET TROOPS IN GEORGIA.  WHILE ITS MEMBERS </p><p>AGREE ON THE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE INDEPENDENCE </p><p>PROCESS, THEY DISAGREE ON WHAT KINDS OF TACTICS TO </p><p>USE.  NOW THAT THE REPUBLIC IS PREPARING TO HOLD </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AS EARLY AS MAY 26, IT IS </p><p>DOUBTFUL THAT THE OVER 60 PARTIES WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>SETTLE ON A CANDIDATE AND MOUNT AN EFFECTIVE </p><p>CAMPAIGN TO CHALLENGE GAMSAKHURDIA\'S BID FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>16.  NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER GHIA CHANTURIA </p><p>TOLD POLOFF THAT IT WAS MUCH HARDER FOR THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONGRESS TO FIGHT AGAINST THE ROUND TABLE THAN IT WAS </p><p>FOR THEM TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>BECAUSE THE ROUND TABLE IS GEORGIAN.  CHANTURIA AND </p><p>OTHERS ADMITTED THAT THEIR SUPPORT AND NUMBERS HAD </p><p>DWINDLED.  INDEED, POLOFF NOTICED THAT THE TWO </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS SHE ATTENDED WERE MUCH SMALLER THAN </p><p>PREVIOUS NATIONAL CONGRESS DEMONSTRATIONS LAST YEAR. </p><p>EVEN THEN, HOWEVER, NATIONAL CONGRESS GATHERINGS </p><p>TENDED TO BE SMALLER THAN ROUND TABLE RALLIES. </p><p> </p><p>17.  THE NATIONAL CONGRESS GROUPS FEAR GAMSAKHURDIA </p><p>AND HAVE LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES ABOUT LACK OF ACCESS </p><p>TO THE MEDIA AND VIOLATIONS OF THEIR FREEDOM OF </p><p>SPEECH.  CHANTURIA TOLD POLOFF THAT GAMSAKHURDIA HAD </p><p>WARNED IN A PUBLIC SPEECH THAT HE WOULD "PHYSICALLY </p><p>DESTROY" THEM.  HE ALSO SAID THAT GAMSAKHURDIA HAD </p><p>PREVENTED THEM FROM GETTING HARD CURRENCY TO PAY FOR </p><p>A TRIP THEY PLANNED TO MAKE TO THE U.S.  IRINA </p><p>SARISHVILI TOLD POLOFF THAT SHE WAS AFRAID THAT </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA WAS PREPARING TO HAVE HER ARRESTED </p><p>BECAUSE SHE WROTE ARTICLES AND MADE SPEECHES CRITICAL </p><p>OF HIS GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>18.  SARISHVILI CALLED GAMSAKHURDIA "A CRUEL MAN" AND </p><p>TOLD POLOFF THAT GAMSAKHURDIA HAD FABRICATED MANY </p><p>ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HER ABOUT COLLABORATING WITH IRAQ </p><p>AND HAVING SEVERAL ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN IN </p><p>ORPHANAGES.  CHANTURIA SAID THAT WHEN THEY TRIED TO </p><p>CHALLENGE GAMSAKHURDIA TO A DEBATE ON TELEVISION, </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA REFUSED AND WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO EVEN </p><p>PRESENT THEIR VIEWS. </p><p> </p><p>19.  INTERESTINGLY, GAMSAKHURDIA AND CHANTURIA HAD </p><p>BEEN FELLOW GEORGIAN DISSIDENTS AT ONE TIME AND HAD </p><p>WORKED TOGETHER AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THEY NOW CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN CLOSE, </p><p>POLOFF CLEARLY REMEMBERS BOTH MEN SINGING EACH </p><p>OTHER\'S PRAISES SEVEN YEARS AGO. </p><p> </p><p>PARAMILITARY GROUPS WAGE POLITICAL BATTLES </p><p>/----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  ACCORDING TO MOST ESTIMATES, ABOUT 25 </p><p>PARAMILITARY GROUPS FUNCTION IN GEORGIA.  ABOUT HALF </p><p>OF THESE ALLEGEDLY BELONG TO POLITICAL GROUPS LOYAL </p><p>TO GAMSAKHURDIA\'S ROUND TABLE AND THE OTHER HALF </p><p>BELONG TO POLITICAL GROUPS LOYAL TO THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONGRESS.  DURING THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO DISARM THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONGRESS\' PARAMILITARY GROUPS AND TRIED TO SLOWLY </p><p>INCORPORATE HIS GROUPS INTO THE GEORGIAN NATIONAL </p><p>GUARD.  THESE TROOPS IN GREEN FATIGUES AND BURGUNDY </p><p>BERETS ARE MOST VISIBLE AROUND THE GEORGIAN SUPREME </p><p>SOVIET BUILDING AND AT THE AIRPORT.  A WESTERN </p><p>JOURNALIST TOLD POLOFF THREE MONTHS AGO THAT </p><p>ACCORDING TO A SOVIET MILITARY GENERAL IN GEORGIA, </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA HAD TRIED TO MAKE A DEAL WITH THE SOVIET </p><p>ARMY TO DISARM THE NATIONAL CONGRESS\' GROUP IN </p><p>EXCHANGE FOR SOME COOPERATION ON DRAFTING YOUNG </p><p>GEORGIANS INTO THE ARMY. </p><p> </p><p>21.  GAMSAKHURDIA HAS FOCUSSED PARTICULARLY ON </p><p>DISBANDING THE MKHEDRIONI GROUP SOMETIMES KNOWN AS </p><p>"THE HORSEMEN" OR THE "KNIGHTS OF MKHEDRIONI." </p><p>INTERESTINGLY, THE MKHEDRIONI WAS FORMED BY BOTH </p><p>GAMSAKHURDIA\'S ROUND TABLE AND GROUPS PRESENTLY </p><p>BELONGING TO THE NATIONAL CONGRESS DURING THE SUMMER </p><p>OF 1989 TO PROTECT GEORGIANS DURING CONFLICTS WITH </p><p>THE ABKHAZIANS AND THE AZERBAYDZHANIS.  AFTER THE </p><p>ROUND TABLE AND THE NATIONAL CONGRESS GROUPS SPLIT, </p><p>THE MKHEDRIONI THREW THEIR SUPPORT TO THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>22.  THE MKHEDRIONI LEADER, JOSELIANI, WAS RECENTLY </p><p>ARRESTED WITH ABOUT 70 OTHER MKHEDRIONI MEMBERS AND </p><p>HAS BEEN AWAITING TRIAL ON CHARGES OF ILLEGAL </p><p>POSSESSION OF WEAPONS.  JOSELIANI\'S SUPPORTERS ADMIT </p><p>THAT HE HAS SERVED FOUR PRISON SENTENCES FOR ARMED </p><p>ROBBERY AND THAT PRIOR TO HIS MOST RECENT ARREST, HE </p><p>HAD NOT BEEN A POLITICAL PRISONER.  NATIONAL CONGRESS </p><p>MEMBER IRINA SARIASHVILI TOLD POLOFF, "WE ACKNOWLEDGE </p><p>THAT HE HAS BEEN A CRIMINAL SO IT IS NOT A PROBLEM. </p><p>HE DOES NOT HIDE IT.  GAMSAKHURDIA UNJUSTLY ARRESTED </p><p>HIM ON CHARGES OF ILLEGALLY POSSESSING WEAPONS.  OF </p><p>COURSE, HE HAD THOSE WEAPONS, BUT IF YOU USE THAT </p><p>CRITERIA YOU COULD IMPRISON EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN </p><p>GEORGIA."  INTERESTINGLY, GEORGIAN MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICIAL LEVON GOGOBERIDZE (PROTECT) </p><p>DEFENDED JOSELIANI\'S CHARACTER BY POINTING OUT THAT </p><p>HE WAS CLEVER ENOUGH TO GET INTO MOSCOW STATE </p><p>UNIVERSITY AFTER OBTAINING ONLY A SEVENTH GRADE </p><p>EDUCATION.  HE ALSO TOLD POLOFF THAT MANY GEORGIANS </p><p>THOUGHT OF JOSELIANI AS AN INTELLECTUAL. </p><p> </p><p>23.  ALTHOUGH GAMSAKHURDIA MAINTAINS THAT ALL THE </p><p>PARAMILITARY GROUPS LOYAL TO THE ROUND TABLE HAVE </p><p>BEEN DISBANDED, POLOFF SAW AND HEARD ENOUGH EVIDENCE </p><p>TO INDICATE THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THESE GROUPS WERE </p><p>STILL ACTIVE.  IN AREAS OUTSIDE TBILISI, ARMED GROUPS </p><p>FROM THE MERAB KOSTAVA SOCIETY, THE LEAGUE OF </p><p>GEORGIAN EAGLES, THE WHITE KNIGHTS OF GEORGIA </p><p>(ROUNDTABLE SPINOFF FROM THE MKHEDRIONI), AND THE </p><p>ILYA THE RIGHTEOUS SOCIETY HAVE BATTLED THE NUMEROUS </p><p>PARAMILITARY GROUPS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO DAVID ONANASHVILI (PROTECT), A NATIONAL </p><p>CONGRESS ACTIVIST, MOST OF THE MORE THAN 20 GROUPS IN </p><p>THE NATIONAL CONGRESS HAVE THEIR OWN PARAMILITARY </p><p>GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>24.  LENINGRAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COLLINS </p><p></p></div>
