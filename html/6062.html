(SBU) Overview of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>Activities to Eliminate Trafficking in Persons: </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>A. There continued to be infrequent anecdotal reports that </p><p>Zimbabwe was a country of origin and transit for </p><p>internationally trafficked persons, particularly women and </p><p>children.  Unlike in previous years, there were no reports </p><p>that Zimbabwe was a destination country.  These reports </p><p>suggested that trafficking might also occur within the </p><p>country,s borders.  There were no reliable numbers or </p><p>estimates regarding the magnitude of the problem.  At the </p><p>writing of this report, a local NGO, Connect, was compiling a </p><p>report of approximately twenty cases of trafficking of girls </p><p>within Zimbabwe; the report was not expected to give </p><p>comprehensive statistics on trafficking in, through, or from </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>B. A South African NGO, Molo Songololo, claimed that Zimbabwe </p><p>was a transit point for children being trafficked from third </p><p>countries such as Asia and Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe to </p><p>South Africa; however, they could provide no specific cases </p><p>or numbers of cases. </p><p> </p><p>C. Connect suggested that in the current economic downturn, </p><p>more families had accepted some form of payment in exchange </p><p>for allowing their teenage daughters to be commercial sex </p><p>workers in other towns within Zimbabwe, notably the border </p><p>town of Beitbridge.  Unlike in previous years, there were no </p><p>reports that Zimbabwe was a destination country. </p><p> </p><p>D. The Connect report is expected later this year. </p><p> </p><p>E. There were no reports that Zimbabwe was a destination </p><p>point for internationally trafficked victims.  There were no </p><p>details available about the conditions into which victims </p><p>were allegedly trafficked within Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>F. Infrequent anecdotal reports suggested that female </p><p>teenagers were targeted primarily.  There was no information </p><p>available concerning traffickers, or their methods. </p><p> </p><p>G. Officials in the Ministry of Justice, and Ministry of </p><p>Education, Sports and Culture were willing to address </p><p>whatever trafficking may be occurring, but they had no data </p><p>on the scope of the problem for which to design a response, </p><p>and were relying on NGOs to alert them to any specific cases. </p><p> In August 2001, Parliament passed and signed into law the </p><p>Sexual Offenses Act, which makes it a crime to transport </p><p>persons across the country\'s borders for the sex industry. </p><p>Traffickers also can be prosecuted under other legislation, </p><p>such as immigration and abduction laws.  A trafficked person </p><p>has the option to take his or her case before the Victim </p><p>Friendly Courts (VFCs). </p><p> </p><p>H. There was no indication that government authorities </p><p>facilitated, were complicit in, or condoned trafficking in </p><p>persons. </p><p> </p><p>I. While the government seemed willing to address the </p><p>problem, in the current economic downturn, there are very </p><p>limited government resources to gather comprehensive data on, </p><p>or respond to anecdotal reports of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Prevention: </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>A. The GOZ recognizes that some trafficking in persons </p><p>occurs, but without specific data had not addressed the issue </p><p>as a large-scale problem. </p><p> </p><p>B. The primary government authority that would combat </p><p>trafficking is the Zimbabwe Republic Police.  The Ministries </p><p>of Justice and Education, and the Victim Friendly Courts, all </p><p>play a role in combatting trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>C. In September 2002, the Child and Law Foundation of </p><p>Zimbabwe held an international conference entitled, </p><p>"Protecting the Sexuality of our Children - Southern Africa </p><p>Regional Meeting" in Harare.  A High Court judge opened the </p><p>conference, and representatives from the Ministries of </p><p>Justice, Education, and Social Welfare also attended.  The </p><p>South African NGO Molo Songololo presented research </p><p>methodologies for data gathering on sexual exploitation. </p><p>Participants acknowledged the need for additional research </p><p>and data-gathering on trafficking in southern Africa. </p><p> </p><p>D. The GOZ supports programs that promote the rights of and </p><p>opportunities for women and children.  The Ministry of Social </p><p>Welfare in particular runs three programs focused on enabling </p><p>children to stay in school. </p><p> </p><p>E. The GOZ\'s capacity to effectively support prevention </p><p>programs is badly hampered by a shortage of resources. </p><p> </p><p>F. The GOZ and civil society groups communicate on the issue </p><p>of trafficking in persons, but there have been no joint </p><p>programs or proposals to date. </p><p> </p><p>G.  Zimbabwe\'s borders are porous; the Department of </p><p>Immigration exercises little control over who crosses into </p><p>and out of Zimbabwe.   Provided with evidence of trafficking, </p><p>we suspect law enforcement agencies would respond </p><p>appropriately. </p><p> </p><p>H. The GOZ has no multi-agency working group or task force on </p><p>trafficking.  It has a public corruption task force which is </p><p>ineffective. </p><p> </p><p>I. See 3. C. </p><p> </p><p>J. The GOZ does not have a national plan of action to address </p><p>trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>K.  The GOZ has not designated a responsible official to </p><p>develop anti-trafficking programs. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers: </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>A. While no laws specifically address trafficking in persons, </p><p>common law prohibits abduction and forced labor, and the </p><p>August 2001 Sexual Offenses Act makes it a crime to transport </p><p>persons across the border for sex. </p><p> </p><p>The Zimbabwe constitution provides that "no one may be held </p><p>in slavery or servitude or be made to perform forced or </p><p>compulsory labor." </p><p> </p><p>The Zimbabwe Criminal Code prohibits corruption of children </p><p>and young persons, and penalizes any person who allows a </p><p>child or a young person to reside in or to frequent a </p><p>brothel.  Similarly, the code penalizes any person who causes </p><p>the seduction, abduction, or prostitution of a child or young </p><p>person.  The code even prohibits allowing the child or young </p><p>person to consort with, enter into employment, or continue in </p><p>the employment of any prostitute or person of known immoral </p><p>character.  Punishment for these offenses is a fine or </p><p>imprisonment for up to 2 years or both. </p><p> </p><p>The Zimbabwean Immigration Act penalizes any person who by </p><p>bribery induces or attempts to induce any immigration officer </p><p>to violate his or her duties under the Act.  The Act </p><p>criminalizes forgery of travel documents for the purposes of </p><p>entering, remaining in, or departing from the country in </p><p>contravention of the act.  The Act penalizes anyone who </p><p>hinders or obstructs any police officer or immigration </p><p>officer in executing his or her duties under the Act. </p><p> </p><p>B. There is no penalty specific to trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>C. There is no minimum penalty for rape or forcible sexual </p><p>assault.  Individuals convicted of one of these crimes must </p><p>be imprisoned, but the length of incarceration is determined </p><p>by precedent.  Sentences for rape convictions typically range </p><p>from four or five years to fifteen years, depending on the </p><p>circumstances of the particular crime. </p><p> </p><p>D. The GOZ has not prosecuted any cases of trafficking to </p><p>date. </p><p> </p><p>E. There was no information available concerning traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>F. No specific cases of trafficking were reported. </p><p> </p><p>G. See 4. F. </p><p> </p><p>H. See 4. F. </p><p> </p><p>I. There were no reports of extradition from Zimbabwe of </p><p>those charged with trafficking in other countries. </p><p> </p><p>J. There was no indication of government involvement in, or </p><p>tolerance of trafficking, at any level. </p><p> </p><p>K. See 4. J. </p><p> </p><p>L. The GOZ ratified ILO Convention 182 on December 11, 2000, </p><p>Conventions 29 and 105 on August 27, 1998.  The GOZ has not </p><p>signed or ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on </p><p>the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child </p><p>Prostitution, and Child Pornography.  The GOZ has not signed </p><p>or ratified the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish </p><p>Trafficking in Persons. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Protection and Assistance to Victims: </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>A. No specific victims of trafficking were identified. </p><p> </p><p>B. See 5. A. </p><p> </p><p>C. See 5. A. </p><p> </p><p>D. See 5. A. </p><p> </p><p>E. See 5. A. </p><p> </p><p>F. There was no indication that the GOZ provided specialized </p><p>training for government officials in recognizing, protecting </p><p>or assisting trafficking victims within Zimbabwe or through </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s foreign missions. </p><p> </p><p>G. See 5. A. </p><p> </p><p>H. No NGOs reported working with trafficking victims.  At the </p><p>time of writing, Connect was researching anecdotal reports on </p><p>trafficking and reported that local police had been very </p><p>cooperative. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Post point of contact for Trafficking in Persons is </p><p>Political Officer Audu Besmer (office phone  263-4-250-593 </p><p>extension 291; fax  263-4-253-000, e-mail: </p><p>besmeram@state.gov).  The estimated hours spent per officer </p><p>in preparation of this report are as follows (Ref):  Polfsn </p><p>15 hours, Poloff 8 hours, Polchief 0.5 hour review, DCM 0.5 </p><p>hour review, AMB 0.5 hour review. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
