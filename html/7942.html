<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ISTANBUL 000667 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: WOLFOWITZ AND PERLE REMARKS REVIVE DEBATE ON </p><p>U.S.-TURKEY TIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b & d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Recent remarks by DOD Deputy Secretary </p><p>Wolfowitz and Defense Policy Board Member Perle have revived </p><p>a rancorous public debate in Istanbul on the status of </p><p>U.S.-Turkish relations.  Reactions to the May 6 Wolfowitz </p><p>interview on CNN Turk also dominated our previously-scheduled </p><p>May 7 meetings with a range of local contacts.  In </p><p>characteristic Turkish fashion, a pro-U.S. NGO leader, a </p><p>retired Admiral, and a local district mayor bristled </p><p>self-defensively upon hearing criticism from a foreign </p><p>quarter.  After some discussion and reflection, however, our </p><p>contacts generally accepted the criticism (while maintaining </p><p>that the USG had made mistakes of its own) and focused on the </p><p>need to rebuild the damaged bilateral relationship.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The following comments provide a sample of the local </p><p>reaction to DOD Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz\'s remarks </p><p>during a May 6 CNN Turk interview: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Retired 3-star Admiral Attila Kayat remarked that it was </p><p>hypocritical and inappropriate for Wolfowitz to claim that </p><p>the Turkish military should have taken a stronger (and hence </p><p>"undemocratic") stand in the lead-up to the Turkish </p><p>parliament vote on whether to allow U.S. troops to enter </p><p>Turkey; </p><p>- ARI Movement President Kemal Koprulu characterized the </p><p>remarks as "blunt," and while admitting that Turkey had made </p><p>mistakes before the vote, argued that the USG had made </p><p>mistakes as well; </p><p>- Nonplused, Beykoz District Mayor Alaattin Koseler (from </p><p>former PM Ecevit\'s Democratic Left Party) asked how deeply </p><p>felt Wolfowitz\'s opinions were within the USG in general. </p><p>Though accepting of poloff\'s explanation that the remarks did </p><p>not run contrary to the idea that Turkey and the U.S. </p><p>remained close allies, Koseler voiced concern that Turkish </p><p>public opinion would react badly regardless of the intended </p><p>meaning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) After some discussion and reflection, however, both </p><p>Kayat and Koprulu readily admitted that Turkey had made </p><p>mistakes and that Wolfowitz had correctly focused on the need </p><p>to rebuild the bilateral relationship.  Kayat was reluctant </p><p>to hold his former military colleagues responsible, arguing </p><p>instead that the Justice and Development (AK) Party </p><p>government should have simply said "no" to the USG from the </p><p>beginning, instead of making promises and engaging in </p><p>negotiations over an assistance package.  Koprulu readily </p><p>accepted that the GOT, the opposition Republican People\'s </p><p>Party (CHP), the bureaucracy, and the military all made </p><p>mistakes.  Both Koprulu and Kayat argued, however, that the </p><p>USG\'s failure to "sell" its case for war to Turkey was a key </p><p>element in the fateful parliamentary decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Defense Board member Richard Perle repeated some of </p><p>Wolfowitz\'s points at a May 8 conference, and went on to </p><p>openly criticize the inexperience of the new Turkish </p><p>government and irresponsibility of the opposition CHP.  The </p><p>questions following Perle\'s remarks on "whether Turkey would </p><p>be forced to pay a price for not supporting the U.S." and </p><p>"what Turkey would need to do to repair the relationship" </p><p>reflect general concerns in Istanbul on the issue.  Perle </p><p>responded that the U.S. has no plans for a retaliatory policy </p><p>and called for both sides to rediscover mutual interests, </p><p>undertake joint projects, and rebuild the damaged bilateral </p><p>relationship.  By criticizing the regimes in Syria and Iraq </p><p>as "undemocratic" and "supportive of terrorists" and </p><p>expressing hope for rapid regime change in both, Perle </p><p>implicitly warned against a Turkish policy which would ignore </p><p>core U.S. interests and implied that this should be an area </p><p>where Turkey and the U.S. work together. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: The remarks by Wolfowitz and Perle have </p><p>revived the underlying unease among our contacts in Istanbul </p><p>regarding the strained U.S.-Turkish relationship. </p><p>Ever-sensitive to foreign criticism, initial reactions were </p><p>self-defensive, but if our contacts are any indication, </p><p>further reflection may lead many here to look for productive </p><p>ways to begin rebuilding the partnership. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
