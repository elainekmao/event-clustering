GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>    ATTEMPTING TO PORTRAY THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND </p><p>    INDEPENDENT MEDIA AS "TERRORISTS."  GOZ OFFICIALS, </p><p>    INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUGABE AND INFORMATION MINISTER </p><p>    MOYO, HAVE RECENTLY DESCRIBED THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>    DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), ITS LEADERS AND SUPPORTERS, </p><p>    AND FOREIGN AND LOCAL JOURNALISTS AS "TERRORISTS." </p><p>    GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS\' USE OF THE WORDS "TERRORISM" AND </p><p>    "TERRORIST" BEGAN WITH CHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE PEOPLE </p><p>    RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ABDUCTION AND MURDER OF WAR VETERAN </p><p>    CAIN NKALA IN BULAWAYO IN EARLY NOVEMBER.  IN THE LAST </p><p>    THREE WEEKS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE USED THOSE TERMS </p><p>    MORE BROADLY TO DESCRIBE THE OPPOSITION AND THE </p><p>    INDEPENDENT MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>2.   PRESIDENT MUGABE, DELIVERING A EULOGY AT THE </p><p>    BURIAL OF WAR VETERAN CAIN NKALA, WARNED: ".THE </p><p>    OPPOSITION MDC WILL BE CRUSHED VIOLENTLY FOR SPONSORING </p><p>    TERRORISTS." </p><p> </p><p>3.   PICKING UP FROM WHERE PRESIDENT MUGABE LEFT OFF, </p><p>    INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO HAS EXPANDED ON THE </p><p>    GOZ\'S "FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM."  UNDER MOYO\'S CONTROL, </p><p>    THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA MAKE </p><p>    EXTREMELY FREQUENT USE OF THE WORDS "TERRORIST" AND </p><p>    "TERRORISM" IN THEIR REPORTING ON THE NKALA CASE.  MOYO </p><p>    HAS ALSO USED THE TERMS "TERRORIST" AND "TERRORISM" TO </p><p>    DESCRIBE INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS.  HE HAS THREATENED </p><p>    "TO GO AFTER" FOREIGN AND LOCAL JOURNALISTS WHOM HE </p><p>    ACCUSED OF "GROSS AND OBSCENE MISREPRESENTATION OF </p><p>    FACTS" IN THEIR REPORTING ON EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE.  IN </p><p>    THE NOVEMBER 23 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED DAILY </p><p>    "THE HERALD," MOYO OFFERS THE FOLLOWING THOUGHTS ON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03547  270550Z </p><p>    FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS AND THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA:  "AS </p><p>    FOR THE CORRESPONDENTS WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO KNOW THAT </p><p>    WE AGREE WITH PRESIDENT BUSH THAT ANYONE WHO IN ANY WAY </p><p>    FINANCES, HARBORS OR DEFENDS TERRORISTS IS HIMSELF A </p><p>    TERRORIST.  WE TOO WILL NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN </p><p>    TERRORISTS AND THEIR FRIENDS OR SUPPORTERS. . .  THIS </p><p>    KIND OF MEDIA TERRORISM WILL NOT BE ALLOWED . . ." </p><p> </p><p>4.   MINISTER MOYO ALSO WROTE AN OP-ED PIECE ON THIS </p><p>    TOPIC FOR THE NOVEMBER 25 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>    OWNED WEEKLY "SUNDAY MAIL."  THE ARTICLE OFFERED </p><p>    FURTHER INSIGHT INTO MINISTER MOYO\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD </p><p>    THE OPPOSITION AND THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA.  UNDER THE </p><p>    TITLE "MDC \'CLEAN-UP\' STRATEGY EXPOSED" MOYO WROTE: ". </p><p>    . .DOES THE MDC, WITH THE SUPPORT OF SOME DIPLOMATIC </p><p>    INTERESTS AND MEDIA HOUSES, REALLY THINK THAT IT CAN </p><p>    HOODWINK ZIMBABWEANS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>    ABOUT ITS COWARDLY TERRORISM UNDERTAKEN UNDER COVER OF </p><p>    DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. . .? THE </p><p>    TIME HAS COME FOR THE MDC TERRORISTS AND THEIR MEDIA </p><p>    AND DIPLOMATIC SUPPORTERS TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT </p><p>    THE ONLY WEAPON THAT CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST THEM </p><p>    WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOR IS THE LAW THROUGH THE COURTS. </p><p>    NOTHING ELSE.  SO THE MDC TERRORISTS AND THEIR MEDIA </p><p>    AND DIPLOMATIC SUPPORTERS CAN RUN, RAVE AND RANT FOR </p><p>    ALL THEY WANT, BUT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HIDE. </p><p>    JUSTICE WILL CATCH UP WITH THEM.  THE LAW WILL SMOKE </p><p>    THEM OUT. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03547  270550Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
