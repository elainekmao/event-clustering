(SBU)  Summary.  Consul met with Justice Ministry (MOJ) </p><p>officials regarding a MOU on adoptions on January 23. </p><p>Specifics were not negotiated, but several elements, which </p><p>are seen as "must-haves" for an MOU, were identified. </p><p>Parties with the "authority" to transmit cases to the </p><p>Vietnamese central authority will be have to identified; </p><p>foreign adoption agencies will have to be licensed by the </p><p>Vietnamese central authority in order to operate or support </p><p>adoptions in Vietnam; and any MOU must allow for the </p><p>decree\'s clauses governing the child\'s citizenship and </p><p>protection of not only the adopted child, but also the </p><p>biological and adoptive parents.  The MOJ provided the </p><p>implementing regulations resulting from the decree and </p><p>agreed to provide the list of adoptions pending under the </p><p>old rules.  The GVN flagged the issue of who will sign the </p><p>MOU.  Consul agreed that USG would review the implementing </p><p>regulations as provided.  A second USG draft MOU should be </p><p>more specific.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>DISCLAIMER </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On January 23, 2003, Consul met again with Nguyen </p><p>Quoc Cuong, Vice Director of the Department for Public </p><p>Notarial, Legal Expertise, Civil Registration, Nationality, </p><p>and Criminal Records, at the Ministry of Justice.  Consul </p><p>and Cuong were not able to discuss the draft MOU provided </p><p>ref D, or any other specifics regarding an MOU as Cuong had </p><p>not received cleared guidance.  Cuong prefaced the </p><p>discussion by saying that any comments about what might or </p><p>might not be included in the MOU were his own and not the </p><p>official comments of the Ministry. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>GENERALLY SPEAKING - THE ESSENTIALS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Cuong pointed out that the decree parallels the </p><p>Hague Convention on Adoptions of 1993 and requested that we </p><p>highlight the positive and good-intentions of the decree in </p><p>media statements.  He reiterated that international </p><p>adoptions will only take place if a bi-lateral agreement of </p><p>some form has been signed between the two countries.  He </p><p>then went on to note that adoption procedures are different </p><p>following the new decree, and highlighted some elements that </p><p>he feels must be included in any MOU.  The adoption </p><p>application dossiers will have to be forwarded from the </p><p>"authority" of the country of the Prospective Adoptive </p><p>Parents (PAPs) to the Vietnamese central authority.  Cuong </p><p>acknowledged that adoption processing is not centralized in </p><p>the US and commented that we would have to work out in our </p><p>MOU to whom that authority would be delegated.  He later </p><p>mentioned that in agreements recently signed with Italy, </p><p>Denmark, and Sweden, that authority was granted to adoption </p><p>agencies.  Consul pressed to see if that authority might be </p><p>granted directly to parents or their representatives, </p><p>particularly in cases where parents are not using an agency, </p><p>but Cuong could not go into this level of detail without </p><p>clearance. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Cuong then continued that the Vietnamese Central </p><p>Authority would forward adoption application dossiers to the </p><p>provinces, and the provinces would have the authority to </p><p>approve a dossier only after the central authority had </p><p>approved it.  The final critical element of an MOU that </p><p>Cuong identified is that US adoption agencies would have to </p><p>be licensed by the Vietnamese central authority in order to </p><p>operate or support adoptions in Vietnam.  He could not </p><p>comment further on what licensing would entail, and simply </p><p>said that `the details would come later.\'  He later </p><p>identified one additional element of the decree which he </p><p>feels must be allowed for in any MOU - the decree governs </p><p>citizenship issues and protects the interests of not only </p><p>the adopted child, but also the biological and adoptive </p><p>parents. (Comment: Mission believes this may be a request </p><p>for language similar to a clause in the draft framework </p><p>agreement which calls for adopted children to not lose </p><p>Vietnamese citizenship unless they choose to renounce after </p><p>reaching legal age.  End Comment) </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>MAKE THE LIST? </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Consul asked about the status of lists of cases </p><p>that had been accepted by the provinces by December 31, 2002 </p><p>for processing under the old rules.  Despite the deadline </p><p>set for provinces to submit these lists to the MOJ by </p><p>January 10th, only about two-thirds of the provinces (about </p><p>40 of 57) have submitted those lists.  The lists received to </p><p>date amount to almost 70 cases, including 27 from Hanoi and </p><p>27 from Ho Chi Minh City.  Cuong guessed that a few (perhaps </p><p>10) of these cases being processed under the old rules may </p><p>run into difficulties - not because of the decree or new </p><p>procedures, but because they were filed by agencies which </p><p>have bad reputations and may not be legal adoptions.  Cuong </p><p>agreed to provide the list, with names and not just numbers, </p><p>when it is complete.  He also agreed to indicate which cases </p><p>he anticipates will be problematic for internal use only, </p><p>not to share with PAPs. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Consul then requested the implementing regulations </p><p>which will govern the implementation of the decree.  Cuong </p><p>provided a copy of 07/2002/TT-BTP, issued on December 16, </p><p>2002, titled: The Instructions for Implementation of Some </p><p>Items of Decree 68/2002/ND-CP July 10, 2002 of the </p><p>Government\'s Regulations on Some Articles of Marriage and </p><p>Family Law on Marriage and Family Relations with Foreign </p><p>Characteristics.  Mission has just received a translation </p><p>which it will fax separately.  Mission has yet to review the </p><p>document but, on first glance, it appears to be broad- </p><p>ranged, covering legalization and notarials of family- </p><p>related documents.  It addresses the marriage of Vietnamese </p><p>nationals to foreigners, and illegitimate children, as well </p><p>as international adoption of Vietnamese children.  Topic </p><p>headers pertaining to adoption include:  Registration of </p><p>Adoption with Foreign Factors, Procedures for Submitting </p><p>Adoption Dossiers, Order of Introduction of Children for </p><p>Adoption, and Procedures for Processing Adoption Dossiers. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>A/S HARTY VISIT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Consul raised A/S Harty\'s upcoming visit and asked </p><p>that the Minister of Justice and Vice Minister Cuong be </p><p>alerted to the possible requests for meetings.  (Note:  Vice </p><p>Minister Cuong is Vice Director Cuong\'s supervisor.)  Vice </p><p>Director Cuong said that he would mention it to Vice </p><p>Minister Cuong immediately but urged that any requests for </p><p>meetings be made as soon as possible through the </p><p>International Relations Department, as March is a very busy </p><p>month. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Consul recalled Cuong\'s earlier indication that </p><p>reaching agreement on an MOU in time for A/S Harty to sign </p><p>during her visit to Vietnam would be impossible, and asked </p><p>that he be open to the possibility.  Cuong indicated that if </p><p>we were to work from the draft MOU as presented, it would be </p><p>impossible to reach agreement by early March.  However, if a </p><p>new draft were presented, detailing how the US would proceed </p><p>in cooperation with the July decree and December </p><p>implementing procedures, Cuong feels that agreement would be </p><p>possible with a lot of hard work.  He added that the three </p><p>agreements which have been successfully negotiated so far, </p><p>have included 90% of the proposed ideas in the Vietnamese </p><p>draft framework agreement.  He stated that a successful MOU </p><p>must indicate cooperation on both sides and agree with the </p><p>basic principles of the draft framework agreement. </p><p>Following on, he acknowledged that the US system and </p><p>adoption procedures are very different from Vietnam\'s, and </p><p>particularly mentioned the de-centralization of the United </p><p>States system where matters are governed at the State level. </p><p>He suggested that these differences should be talked </p><p>through. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Cuong raised the issue of who would be signing the </p><p>MOU.  He indicated that "the President" would have to </p><p>authorize whoever did the signing.  (He seemed to be </p><p>indicating a direct authorization specific to this MOU.) </p><p>Cuong asked that the USG begin now to determine who will </p><p>sign and then authorize that person to sign.  He was pleased </p><p>that the Ambassador was discussing the MOU at a high level </p><p>in Washington, D.C. at that very moment. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>MORE SPECIFICITY </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Comment.  Cuong\'s comments focused on a key GVN </p><p>point:  The GVN considers that our first draft MOU was </p><p>overly-simplified and thus cannot comment on that first </p><p>draft.  Mission recommends that our next draft be </p><p>substantive, and address specific points where the US will </p><p>cooperate and comply with the decree and implementing </p><p>regulations. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
