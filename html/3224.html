<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 001285 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  PROSPECTS FOR ELECTIONS CLOUDED BY </p><p>SECURITY, LOGISTICAL CONCERNS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.

REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)   Despite Prime Minister Deuba\'s repeated assurances </p><p>that the Government of Nepal will proceed with national </p><p>elections on schedule, the Embassy finds increasing numbers </p><p>of commentators who express significant concern that </p><p>elections can be held as planned.  Questions about the </p><p>ability of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) and the police to </p><p>provide adequate security at the nation\'s 7,000 polling </p><p>places--to say nothing of pre-election campaign </p><p>activities--top the list of such concerns.  Compounding the </p><p>uncertainty is the lack of clear Constitutional guidelines in </p><p>the event elections must be postponed, or cannot be held in </p><p>all 75 districts.  Many observers have suggested the King may </p><p>use a vaguely-worded Constitutional provision granting him </p><p>latitude to act in the event of such "difficulty" to appoint </p><p>an interim government if elections are unable to take place </p><p>on time.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>ELECTIONS--FIVE MONTHS AND COUNTING </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Although more than a month has passed since King </p><p>Gyanendra dissolved Parliament and set national elections for </p><p>November 13 (Ref C), serious planning to stage such elections </p><p>still seems largely on hold for a variety of reasons, </p><p>including the split within the Prime Minister\'s own Nepali </p><p>Congress Party (Ref A); a pending Supreme Court decision on </p><p>the constitutionality of the dissolution of Parliament (Ref </p><p>B); the uncertainty of the security situation; a lack of </p><p>clarity regarding emergency restrictions on campaign </p><p>activities; and last but by no means least, the general </p><p>proclivity towards procrastination across the Nepali polity. </p><p>The Election Commission has yet to announce the findings of a </p><p>redistricting committee, which is reallocating Parliamentary </p><p>seats based on the 2001 census; to make public the budget </p><p>needed to hold the elections; or to decide whether polling </p><p>will be held on a single day or in consecutive phases </p><p>throughout the kingdom.  While there is some speculation that </p><p>the Election Commission may be deferring action until the </p><p>Supreme Court decision on whether to reinstate Parliament, </p><p>there is also concern that planning the logistics of </p><p>elections in a country suffering an insurgency nationwide may </p><p>be proving too much for the Commission\'s limited resources </p><p>and political clout.  There is some concern that the </p><p>Commission may be ceding much of its planning authority to </p><p>the military, who will, perforce, undertake a greatly </p><p>expanded role in providing security--and thus have much </p><p>greater input in logistical discussions--than ever before. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>SECURITY:  BIGGEST CONCERN, GREATEST LIMITATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Given the factors cited above, many </p><p>observers--including many would-be participants--question </p><p>whether elections can take place as scheduled.  Concern about </p><p>the ability of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) and the police to </p><p>provide adequate security at the nation\'s 7,000 polling </p><p>places--to say nothing of pre-election campaign </p><p>activities--is the most significant source of doubt.  Even </p><p>now, before campaigning has begun, security forces are </p><p>stretched to capacity guarding sensitive infrastructure, </p><p>district headquarters, and government buildings and VIPs in </p><p>Kathmandu.  Many assume the insurgents will attack </p><p>candidates, intimidate voters, and capitalize on the </p><p>diversion of security forces to launch raids on vital </p><p>infrastructure.  A June press release from Maoist leader </p><p>Prachanda brands the elections as a false "drama" staged by </p><p>the Palace and Army, and castigates the Communist Party of </p><p>Nepal - United Marxist Leninist for announcing its intention </p><p>to participate.  More explicit warnings against participation </p><p>have been given to individual politicians in outlying </p><p>districts.  Even if, as has been often suggested, the </p><p>election is conducted in separate phases, with polling taking </p><p>place on different days in different areas of the country, </p><p>any concentration of security forces in a particular </p><p>geographic region could invite a Maoist attack in other, less </p><p>protected areas, some observers fear.  One former MP from the </p><p>Terai, a region comparatively less affected by Maoist </p><p>violence, suggested that conducting polling even in the </p><p>relative safety of his constituency will present significant </p><p>challenges, commenting, "It won\'t take much effort (for the </p><p>Maoists) to disturb the elections."  How to pay for the </p><p>crippling cost of mobilizing the security needed--one source </p><p>put the price tag at USD 23 million--for a country already </p><p>facing severe budgetary problems is another cause for </p><p>concern. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>ROLE OF THE ARMY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Members of Opposition political parties have also </p><p>voiced concern about the expanded presence of the </p><p>military--whom they perceive as sympathetic toward incumbent </p><p>Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba--at polling places this </p><p>election.  Some question if the Army leadership, who they </p><p>believe influenced Deuba\'s move to extend the emergency and </p><p>dissolve Parliament, can be counted on to maintain strict </p><p>impartiality during the voting.  During the previous election </p><p>in 1994, Opposition Leader Madhav Kumar Nepal recalled, armed </p><p>thugs kept his party representatives away from some of the </p><p>polling places, making it impossible to monitor the voting </p><p>procedures.  (Note:  International observers judged this </p><p>election to be basically free and fair, but clearly some </p><p>abuses were committed by a number of parties.  End note.) </p><p>With so many more guns in evidence at polling places, even if </p><p>they are in the hands of the military, he said he fears the </p><p>potential for such intimidation will increase. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>PROSPECTS AND PARTICIPATION--THE VIEW FROM SIX PARTIES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Given the degree of uncertainty surrounding the </p><p>elections, politicians from most parties have yet to begin </p><p>campaigning--or trying to construct coalitions--in earnest. </p><p>The paralysis in the Nepali Congress Party, whose two rival </p><p>factions are awaiting an Election Commission ruling on which </p><p>has the right to use the Party name, symbol, and flag in the </p><p>upcoming elections (Ref A), has helped keep the usual </p><p>horse-trading and deal-making in temporary limbo. </p><p>Discussions with representatives of six parties reveal that </p><p>most (with the possible exception of the far-leftist United </p><p>People\'s Front and National People\'s Front) are planning to </p><p>participate in elections, while simultaneously expressing </p><p>doubt that elections can be held in the current environment. </p><p>Many Opposition party representatives have also pointed out </p><p>that the emergency continues to place substantial </p><p>restrictions on their ability to campaign, hold rallies, or </p><p>give speeches. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>GOVERNMENT ASSURANCES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The Nepali Congress Party alone--that is to say, the </p><p>Deuba faction of the split party--expresses confidence that </p><p>elections will take place as planned.  At a June 28 meeting </p><p>with business leaders and diplomats (from the U.S., U.K., </p><p>France, Germany, and India) at the Ambassador\'s residence, </p><p>the PM asserted that conducting elections in all 75 districts </p><p>will be "difficult, but not impossible."  The election might </p><p>take place in phases ("perhaps three-to-five phases; I don\'t </p><p>know") to allow the concentration of security forces needed </p><p>to provide adequate security in a given locality.  He </p><p>acknowledged security will be a problem in seven districts </p><p>and some other constituencies in the Maoist heartland, but </p><p>noted the Royal Nepal Army has enlisted 5,000 new soldiers, </p><p>and the Armed Police Force 7,000 new recruits, who can help </p><p>fulfill the additional manpower requirements during election </p><p>time.  He added that the Government plans to invite </p><p>international observers to participate, possibly under UN </p><p>auspices.  To help defray the costs of holding the election, </p><p>the Government has already decided to suspend "300-400" </p><p>development projects.  He realizes that suspension of these </p><p>projects will be taken at some political cost, but sees no </p><p>alternative to paying that price. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Nepal\'s Constitution offers little guidance about </p><p>procedures in the all-too-likely event that elections may not </p><p>take place nationwide by the scheduled date.  The </p><p>Constitution stipulates a five-year term for the Lower House </p><p>of Parliament, "unless dissolved earlier."  If the King </p><p>dissolves Parliament, he must "specify a date, to be within </p><p>six months (of the date of dissolution), for new elections." </p><p>The Constitution does not/not state that elections must </p><p>actually be held within six months, and offers no </p><p>prescription for remedial action if elections are not </p><p>actually held within the specified time. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The Constitution also makes no provision for </p><p>partial elections (other than a by-election to fill a seat </p><p>vacated by the death, resignation or dismissal of a member) </p><p>or elections during a state of emergency (except to say that </p><p>Members\' terms may be extended for one year during a state of </p><p>emergency).  One legal expert speculated that as long as </p><p>polling could be held to elect at least 25 percent of the </p><p>Lower House\'s 205 Members--the quorum needed for voting </p><p>purposes--the elections could be deemed valid and the House </p><p>could meet.  Elections for additional seats could then later </p><p>be held as possible.  The Constitution, however, does not </p><p>explicitly authorize such an election, and any attempt to </p><p>convene a Parliament that had fewer than its complete </p><p>membership of 205 elected would undoubtedly face a challenge </p><p>in the Supreme Court.  Nor would people likely accept results </p><p>from an election held only in fortified district </p><p>headquarters, according to former MPs representing four </p><p>different political parties.  Such limited polling would </p><p>constitute a travesty, one commented, and could never be </p><p>characterized as full, free, fair, or an accurate reflection </p><p>of the will of the Nepali people. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  If the elections are held, as expected, in phases, </p><p>polling could take as long as six months.  Many observers </p><p>anticipate that degraded security conditions in the Maoist </p><p>heartland will make voting outside of district headquarters </p><p>virtually impossible, possibly necessitating the repeated </p><p>postponement of polling there.  Although the Constitution </p><p>sets no limit on the time by which elections must have taken </p><p>place, many observers fear that protracted polling--and the </p><p>predictable public discontent that would likely accompany </p><p>it--could set the stage for activation of the Constitution\'s </p><p>ambiguously-worded Clause 127, granting the King the power to </p><p>"issue necessary Orders" to "remove (any) difficulty" arising </p><p>in the implementation of the Constitution.  The vague wording </p><p>of the Clause gives the King broad scope to undertake any </p><p>action he deems likely to "remove such difficulty," from the </p><p>continued postponement of elections to the appointment of an </p><p>interim government. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Many political and business sources, clearly </p><p>anticipating that stalled elections will necessitate some </p><p>form of Palace intervention, have floated a variety of </p><p>theoretical scenarios for such action, ranging from the </p><p>sublime (the King calls a Constitutional convention; Maoists </p><p>participate; the Constitution is amended; Maoists come into </p><p>political mainstream; free and fair elections are held) to </p><p>the ridiculous (the King reinstates absolute monarchy).  One </p><p>businessman suggested the King could name a caretaker </p><p>government headed by Deuba, appoint a technocrat Cabinet, and </p><p>use the interim before elections to restore good governance, </p><p>root out corruption, and crack down on the insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Despite the Prime Minsiter\'s upbeat assessment of </p><p>election prospects, we share many of our interlocutors\' </p><p>reservations about the Government\'s ability to hold free, </p><p>fair, and credible elections on time, given the threat posed </p><p>by Maoist insurgents in virtually every district of the </p><p>country.  This is not, unfortunately, a problem that can be </p><p>ameliorated by international observers, donor-funded voter </p><p>education programs, or any of the usual battery of assistance </p><p>friendly democracies usually bring to the table.  Continued </p><p>postponement of the elections or any attempt to hold polling </p><p>in only selected parts of the country would doubtless result </p><p>in protracted Court challenges to the validity of the voting </p><p>and the legitimacy of any government so elected.  The Nepali </p><p>Congress political shenanigans that caused the Prime Minister </p><p>to dissolve Parliament have pushed Nepal into a situation </p><p>from which there is no graceful or easy exit. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
