BISHOPS AND PRIESTS REPORT </p><p>OFTEN THRIVING CONGREGATIONS BUT LAMENT INSUFFICIENT </p><p>NUMBERS OF PRIESTS.  UNOFFICIALLY-RECOGNIZED NUNS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02949  01 OF 03  130701Z </p><p>DANANG RUN A CENTER FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN AND A PRE- </p><p>SCHOOL PROGRAM, FINANCED IN PART BY EXPORTS OF </p><p>HANDICRAFTS.  SOME CATHOLIC LEADERS INDICATED THAT </p><p>FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY HAD BEEN ASKING FOR TROUBLE IN THE </p><p>RUN-UP TO HIS ARREST AND LENGTHY SENTENCE, BUT </p><p>EXPRESSED REGRET THAT GVN AUTHORITIES WOULD NOT PERMIT </p><p>PRISON VISITS BY CATHOLIC CLERGY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  DURING OCTOBER 25-NOVEMBER 2 TRAVEL BY EMBASSY </p><p>VEHICLE BETWEEN HO CHI MINH CITY AND HANOI (SEPTELS </p><p>FOCUS ON DISCUSSIONS WITH PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS), POL/C </p><p>AND POL FSN MADE NUMEROUS IMPROMPTU VISITS TO CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCHES ALONG THE ROADSIDE, AS WELL AS STOPS AT SOME </p><p>PROTESTANT CHURCHES AND BUDDHIST TEMPLES.

(U)  BIEN HOA PROVINCIAL CAPITAL DONG NAI IS ABOUT </p><p>45 KILOMETERS NORTH OF HO CHI MINH CITY ALONG ROUTE ONE </p><p>AND HOME TO MANY OF THE CATHOLIC REFUGEES WHO LEFT THE </p><p>NORTH IN 1954.  FOR MILES ALONG THE HIGHWAY, CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCHES LINE THE HIGHWAY EVERY COUPLE HUNDRED FEET. </p><p>MANY OF THESE OFTEN LARGE AND STUNNING CHURCHES WERE </p><p>REBUILT IN THE 1990S WHEN IT BECAME EASIER FOR FAMILIES </p><p>AND FRIENDS OVERSEAS TO SEND MONEY TOWARD THE </p><p>REPLACEMENT AND/OR EXPANSION OF EARLIER CHURCH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02949  01 OF 03  130701Z </p><p>BUILDINGS.  MANY IF NOT MOST OF THESE PARISHES REMAIN </p><p>BASED ON ORIGINAL PARISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE NORTH AND </p><p>RETAIN SOME LINKS WITH THEIR ORIGINAL PARISH. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) TAN TINH PARISH, FOR EXAMPLE, NOW BOASTS A </p><p>STUNNING TWO YEAR OLD HEXAGONAL CHURCH, REPORTEDLY </p><p>BUILT AT A COST OF USD 500,000 AND CAPABLE OF SEATING </p><p>OVER 1,000 PEOPLE.  AT LEAST 200 PEOPLE ATTEND THE </p><p>DAILY 5 A.M. MASSES, ACCORDING TO PARISHIONERS.  ONLY </p><p>ONE PRIEST SERVES THIS ACTIVE PARISH, HOWEVER.  SAI </p><p>QUAT PARISH, WHOSE 4,000 MEMBERS COME MOSTLY FROM THAI </p><p>BINH PROVINCE, ALSO HAVE ABOUT 200 PEOPLE FOR EARLY </p><p>MORNING DAILY MASS AND AT LEAST 1,000 CHILDREN STUDYING </p><p>CATECHISM.  ITS PRIEST CLAIMED THAT BIBLES AND TEACHING </p><p>MATERIALS WERE SUFFICIENT BUT THAT CLASSROOM SPACE WAS </p><p>NOT.  MONEY FROM OVERSEAS WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS </p><p>REBUILDING; THE PRIEST SAID THAT THE CHURCH WAS NOW </p><p>ABLE TO OFFER SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ORIGINAL </p><p>PARISH IN THE NORTH. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  NEARBY THACH LAM PARISH STEMS FROM THE 1954 </p><p>EXODUS FROM NAM BINH AND NOW HAS A SEATING CAPACITY FOR </p><p>OVER 1,000 PEOPLE ON ITS ELABORATE GRANITE BENCHES (A </p><p>LOCAL SPECIALITY).  IT, TOO, HAS OVER "HUNDREDS" OF </p><p>CATECHISM STUDENTS BUT ONLY ONE PRIEST.  CARPENTERS </p><p>WERE BUSY BUILDING ADDITIONAL WOODEN BENCHES FOR THE </p><p>OVERFLOW CROWDS WHO MUST SIT OUTSIDE DURING THE MORE </p><p>CROWDED SUNDAY MASSES.  LAC HOA PARISHIONERS ARE MOSTLY </p><p>NATIVES OF THAI BINH PROVINCE;  THE FRENCH-SPEAKING </p><p>PRIEST CLAIMED THAT ABOUT 1,000 OF ITS 5,000 MEMBERS </p><p>TURN UP FOR EARLY MORNING MASS EVERY DAY.  HE IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02949  01 OF 03  130701Z </p><p>ASSISTED BY A YOUNGER CURATE WHO, BOTH PRIESTS SAID, </p><p>HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED BY THE GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE ON </p><p>RELIGION TO BECOME A PRIEST OFFICIALLY FOLLOWING </p><p>SEMINARY.  IT OFFERS CATECHISM CLASSES TO ABOUT 1,000 </p><p>STUDENTS.  NEW MEMBERS TEND TO BE ONLY THOSE WHO MARRY </p><p>INTO CATHOLIC FAMILIES;  THE PRIEST SAID THAT THERE </p><p>WERE FEW EXAMPLES OF VIETNAMESE HAVING BEEN CONVERTED </p><p>BY FRIENDS. </p><p> </p><p>NORTHWARD </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THUAN DIEN PARISH LIES IN NINH THUAN PROVINCE </p><p>NORTH OF PHAN THIET.  IT HOSTS TWO CHURCHES WITH TOTAL </p><p>MEMBERSHIP OF ABOUT 2,000 SERVED BY TWO PRIESTS.  ABOUT </p><p>200 PEOPLE COME FOR MORNING MASSES, AND IT OFFERS BIBLE </p><p>CLASSES TWICE A WEEK FOR CHILDREN UNDER 16.  HO DIEN </p><p>CHURCH, ALSO IN NINH THUAN PROVINCE, BOASTS A BEAUTIFUL </p><p>100-YEAR OLD CHURCH BUILDING THAT WAS RECENTLY </p><p>RENOVATED.  ONE OF ITS TWO PRIESTS BEMOANED THE </p><p>FRUSTRATIONS THE PARISH HAD FACED IN OBTAINING </p><p>PERMISSION FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR EVERY STEP OF THE </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION.  HE ALSO POINTED TO AN ADJACENT LARGE </p><p>SCHOOL BUILDING AND EXPLAINED THAT IT HAD BEEN TAKEN </p><p>OVER BY THE STATE IN 1975.  CHURCH AUTHORITIES ARE </p><p>STILL IN TOUCH WITH THE LAST FRENCH PRIEST WHO SERVED </p><p>THIS PARISH, HE ADDED.  ABOUT 400 CHILDREN ATTEND </p><p>CATECHISM CLASSES BUT CLASSROOM SPACE IS A CONSTRAINT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02949  02 OF 03  130702Z </p><p>8.  (U)  BEYOND DANANG, CHURCH BUILDINGS ARE NOTICEABLY </p><p>FEWER ALONG ROUTE ONE.  LOCAL AUTHORITIES CLAIMED IN </p><p>SOME PLACES INCLUDING QUANG NAM AND QUANG TRI PROVINCES </p><p>THAT U.S. BOMBING HAD DESTROYED EARLIER CHURCHES.  THE </p><p>CHURCH AT LA VANG IN QUANG TRI, WHERE UP TO 100,000 </p><p>CATHOLICS GATHER EVERY THREE YEARS TO COMMEMORATE THE </p><p>APPEARANCE OF THE VIRGIN MARY, IS ONE SUCH BOMBED OUT </p><p>CHURCH.  ANOTHER EDIFICE REMAINS IN RUINS ALONG THE </p><p>RIVER IN DOWNTOWN DONG HAI, CAPITAL OF QUANG BINH </p><p>PROVINCE, ALTHOUGH POL/C WAS UNABLE TO CONFIRM HOW IT </p><p>WAS DESTROYED.  NOT UNTIL PHAT DIEM DISTRICT IN NINH </p><p>BINH PROVINCE (SEPTEL) IN THE NORTH DOES THERE APPEAR </p><p>TO BE ANY MAJOR CONCENTRATION OF CATHOLIC CHURCHES AND </p><p>COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>DANANG </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  OVER 80 CATHOLIC NUNS HAVE SINCE 1993 BEEN </p><p>RUNNING A CENTER FOR OVER 100 HANDICAPPED YOUTH NEXT </p><p>DOOR TO THE 75-YEAR OLD PINK CATHEDRAL IN DOWNTOWN </p><p>DANANG.  SEVERAL SISTERS EXPLAINED THAT THEIR ORDER </p><p>ALSO OPERATES 46 "HOUSES" FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN, </p><p>LEPERS, AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN NATIONWIDE, </p><p>INCLUDING IN MINORITY AREAS OF BAN ME THUOT, KON TUM, </p><p>AND GIA LAI. THEY ASSERTED THAT THE STATE RUNS NO SUCH </p><p>SCHOOLS OR CENTERS ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.  THEY ALSO </p><p>PROVIDE A CENTER FOR MORE THAN 600 PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN, </p><p>MOSTLY FROM FAMILIES WITH TWO WORKING PARENTS.  THEY </p><p>RECEIVE NO ASSISTANCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND MAINTAIN </p><p>THEMSELVES PRIMARILY BY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OVERSEAS AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02949  02 OF 03  130702Z </p><p>SALES (MOSTLY EXPORT) OF EMBROIDERY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C).  SEVERAL SISTERS ASSERTED THAT THE STATE DOES </p><p>NOT RECOGNIZE THEIR RELIGIOUS STATUS OFFICIALLY.  MANY </p><p>HAD TAKEN THEIR VOWS BEFORE 1975;  THEY CLAIMED THAT NO </p><p>ONE HAS BEEN ALLOWED OFFICIALLY TO BECOME A NUN SINCE </p><p>THEN.  NEW SISTERS HAVE JOINED "SECRETLY" BUT THE </p><p>CONVENT HAS PREFERRED NOT TO ASK FOR PERMISSION DUE TO </p><p>THEIR CONVICTION THE STATE WOULD REFUSE.  THE LOCAL </p><p>COMMITTEE ON RELIGION APPEARS TO BE WELL AWARE OF THEIR </p><p>EXISTENCE, HOWEVER.  SISTERS DESCRIBED HOW THE </p><p>COMMITTEE KEEPS A CLOSE EYE ON THEIR EDUCATIONAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND HAS FORCED A CLEAR DEMARCATION -- A </p><p>FENCE, SEPARATE KITCHENS -- BETWEEN THE CENTER AND THE </p><p>CONVENT ITSELF.  THEY NOTED THAT THEY WERE EXTREMELY </p><p>CAREFUL NEVER TO DISCUSS RELIGION WITH THE CHILDREN OR </p><p>TO UNDERTAKE ANY PROSELYTIZING. </p><p> </p><p>BISHOPS SPEAK OUT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  THE BISHOP OF DANANG DESCRIBED THE THREE </p><p>MAJOR DIFFICULTIES FACING THE CHURCH TODAY AS SELECTION </p><p>OF BISHOPS, ORDINATION OF PRIESTS, AND OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>FOR TRAINING.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE SITUATION WAS AT </p><p>LEAST "BETTER NOW" AND NOTED THE MORE THAN 1,000 </p><p>STUDENTS TAKING CATECHISM AND BIBLE CLASSES AT HIS </p><p>CATHEDRAL.  ONE OF THE FIVE SUNDAY SERVICES IS </p><p>EXPLICITLY DIRECTED AT YOUTH GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  THE BISHOP OF THANH HOA, WHO JUST STEPPED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02949  02 OF 03  130702Z </p><p>DOWN AS THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE EPISCOPAL </p><p>CONFERENCE OF BISHOPS, NOTED THAT THE INTEREST IN THE </p><p>CHURCH WAS NOWADAYS LIMITED IN PARTICULAR DUE TO </p><p>ONGOING PREOCCUPATION WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>STATUS, AND BY SMALLER FAMILY SIZE.  PARENTS ARE LESS </p><p>WILLING TO HAVE AN ONLY SON ENTER THE PRIESTHOOD, HE </p><p>SAID.  HE INSISTED THAT RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>COMMITTEE ON RELIGION WERE "BETTER THAN BEFORE," AND </p><p>CLAIMED THAT SRV OFFICIALS WERE NOW "LESS INVOLVED" IN </p><p>CHURCH AFFAIRS.  HE DESCRIBED ONGOING, ACTIVE </p><p>COMMUNICATION WITH THE VATICAN, BOTH BY E-MAIL AND BY </p><p>TELEPHONE, AND SAID THAT THE SRV IS AWARE OF SUCH </p><p>LIAISON AND RAISES NO OBJECTION.  HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN </p><p>TO THE VATICAN ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, HE NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  THE BISHOP ADDED WITH PRIDE THAT EACH OF THE </p><p>401 CHURCHES IN HIS DIOCESE HAS ONE OR TWO PRIESTS, BUT </p><p>NOTED THAT THIS NUMBER WAS CLEARLY INSUFFICIENT FOR THE </p><p>SIZE OF THE MEMBERSHIP.  ON SUNDAYS, HE ESTIMATED THAT </p><p>1500 PEOPLE WORSHIP AT THE CATHEDRAL, WITH ABOUT 100 </p><p>PEOPLE AT THE DAILY MORNING MASS.  HE SAID HE REGRETTED </p><p>THAT CATHOLIC CHURCHES IN MINORITY AREAS OPERATED </p><p>ENTIRELY IN VIETNAMESE LANGUAGE AND THAT THERE WERE, AS </p><p>OF YET, NO PRIESTS FROM AN ETHNIC MINORITY. </p><p> </p><p>FATHER LY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  THE BISHOP OF DANANG SAID THAT, WHILE HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02949  03 OF 03  130702Z </p><p>REGRETTED THE LENGTHY SENTENCE ON FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY, </p><p>FATHER LY\'S ACTIVITIES HAD BEEN "NOT GOOD" AND THAT HE </p><p>HAD INDEED BEEN MIXING POLITICS AND RELIGION IN WAYS </p><p>AGAINST WHICH HE HAD BEEN WARNED.  THE BISHOP OF THANH </p><p>HOA CALLED FATHER LY\'S CASE "COMPLICATED" AND SAID THAT </p><p>HE BELIEVED THAT FATHER LY\'S GREATEST "CRIME" HAD BEEN </p><p>TO ADVOCATE A "MULTI-PARTY" SYSTEM.  HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>FATHER LY HAD "PUSHED" TOO HARD AND HAD FAILED TO </p><p>ACCEPT DISCIPLINE EITHER FROM THE CHURCH OR FROM THE </p><p>STATE AND HAD CONTINUED TO ADVOCATE "PERSONAL" VIEWS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  THE BISHOP OF THANH HOA NONETHELESS EXPRESSED </p><p>A HOPE THAT FATHER LY WOULD DEMONSTRATE A "GOOD </p><p>ATTITUDE" IN PRISON AND NOT HAVE TO SERVE THE ENTIRE </p><p>SENTENCE.  HE CONFIRMED, HOWEVER, THAT PRIESTS AND </p><p>MINISTERS WERE BARRED FROM MAKING PRISON VISITS; </p><p>FATHER LY WILL BE UNABLE TO MAKE A CONFESSION OR TAKE </p><p>THE SACRAMENT WHILE HE IS IMPRISONED, HE NOTED.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT THE CHURCH HAD NOT PRESSED FOR PRISON ACCESS </p><p>TO CATHOLIC PRISONERS, NOTING THAT IN SOME CASES "THE </p><p>STATE STILL DOES NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND RELIGION." </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  COMMENT:  CATHOLIC AND OTHER RELIGIOUS LIFE </p><p>CONTINUES TO HAVE A NOTICEABLE AND OFTEN VIBRANT </p><p>PRESENCE THROUGHOUT VIETNAM, ALTHOUGH ITS VISIBILITY </p><p>AND DYNAMISM IS VARIABLE.  THERE APPEARS TO BE A BROAD </p><p>RECOGNITION BY CATHOLICS AND OTHERS THAT THE OFFICIAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT FOR RELIGIOUS LIFE HAS IMPROVED </p><p>DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND THAT FEWER </p><p>CONSTRAINTS NOW EXIST ON STATE-SANCTIONED SERVICES OR </p><p>CONTACTS WITH RELIGIOUS ENTITIES ABROAD. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02949  03 OF 03  130702Z </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
