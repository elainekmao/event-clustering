Coalition forces vacated the silo in Karbala and the </p><p>warehouse in Al Hillah to make way for food arrivals, but </p><p>continue to provide security to both structures.  UXO has </p><p>been discovered in the Karbala MOT warehouse.  Large </p><p>quantities of food have begun to arrive in Al Hillah for the </p><p>Babil Governorate.  Ninawa Governorate has been asked to </p><p>prepare for the arrival of 5,000 MT of wheat grain per day, </p><p>but the shortage of adequate silo space in Ninawa could be a </p><p>problem.  The DART briefed Coalition forces in Kuwait on the </p><p>magnitude and needs of the PDS.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>FOOD STORAGE IN KARBALA </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART met with staff of the U.N. World Food Program </p><p>(WFP), Ministry of Trade (MOT) silo manager, and Coalition </p><p>forces based in Karbala on 19 May.  The DART discussed the </p><p>upcoming public distribution system (PDS) and explained </p><p>WFP\'s role, observed initial WFP rice deliveries, and </p><p>confirmed wheat grain stocks in the Karbala grain silo. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART also confirmed that Coalition forces have </p><p>vacated the grain silo in Karbala.  The MOT silo manager </p><p>claims that Coalition forces removed property from the silo </p><p>grounds and has presented an inventory of missing items to </p><p>battalion headquarters.  The DART discussed this issue with </p><p>a Coalition officer who stated that he would follow up to </p><p>determine a course of action.  Amoung the items on the MOT </p><p>list are two tractor-trailer cabs, tools, several computers, </p><p>office furniture, and cash from the office safe.  The DART </p><p>confirmed that all MOT staff in Karbala received USD 20 </p><p>emergency payments and is in contact with MOT Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART inquired about the possibility of security </p><p>assistance, and the Coalition officer agreed that frequent </p><p>patrols and visible presence by Coalition forces in the area </p><p>of the silo and warehouses could be established.  At the </p><p>same time, the Karbala Protective Force has been deemed </p><p>antagonistic to rehabilitation efforts and will be disbanded </p><p>by Coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WFP\'s ten-person national staff is established and </p><p>operational at the MOT warehouse.  They relayed to the DART </p><p>that any public information messages should be focused on </p><p>instructions to food agents and should include precise dates </p><p>for ration distributions, actual quantities of each </p><p>commodity in the ration, as well as the ration basket </p><p>contents.  This was the pre-war practice, and beneficiaries </p><p>will be expecting this information as a normal function of </p><p>PDS. </p><p>6.  WFP and the DART discovered unexploded ordnance (UXO) in </p><p>one area of the MOT warehouse complex.  The DART requested </p><p>and received an initial UXO assessment by Coalition forces </p><p>that confirmed UXO contamination.  A request for UXO removal </p><p>and a general mine sweep of the warehouse area was submitted </p><p>to the Coalition and an operation was approved and set for </p><p>18 May. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>MOVING COALITIION FORCES FROM THE AL HILLAH WAREHOUSE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  After receiving reports from WFP staff that had recently </p><p>visited Al Hillah and found that Coalition forces were </p><p>occupying the MOT warehouse and tightly controlling WFP </p><p>truck access to the warehouse (allowing only two trucks to </p><p>unload at a time), the DART visited the warehouse on 17 May. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The DART met with representatives of the Civil Military </p><p>Operations Center (CMOC) in Al Hillah, as well as a </p><p>Coalition Commander at the MOT warehouse, to find a </p><p>resolution to the problems.   After some discussion, the </p><p>Coalition forces agreed to vacate the warehouse the </p><p>following day (18 May).  The Coalition forces expressed </p><p>concern about the safety of the command post located behind </p><p>the warehouse complex and adjacent to the perimeter wall. </p><p>The Coalition forces proposed to build a barrier wall on the </p><p>warehouse side that would protect the perimeter wall.  The </p><p>fact that trucks would constantly need to enter and leave </p><p>the warehouse facility remained a concern, but the Coalition </p><p>forces agreed to work with WFP to arrive at a solution that </p><p>would increase the turn-around time of the trucks.  In </p><p>addition to the WFP trucks that are delivering commodities </p><p>to the MOT warehouse, food agent trucks are collecting </p><p>rations for the September and October distribution as </p><p>directed by MOT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  On 19 May, the DART confirmed that the Coalition forces </p><p>had vacated the MOT warehouse.  It remains, however, under </p><p>the security blanket of the Coalition command that provides </p><p>security at the front entrance to the warehouse compound </p><p>with a ground team and a two-man machine gun nest on the </p><p>roof of the MOT office building. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WFP stated that the MOT would eventually be responsible </p><p>for providing warehouse compound security.  But until that </p><p>time, the Coalition forces would continue to secure the </p><p>front gate and inspect incoming vehicles.  On May 20 in Al </p><p>Hillah, DART met with the Coalition Military Police who </p><p>agreed to include MOT security guards in the upcoming Civil </p><p>Military Operations Center (CMOC) police security training. </p><p>In addition to the warehouse, MOT security will also be </p><p>needed at the Al Hillah grain silo facilities. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS IN AL HILLAH </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The MOT reports that September distributions began </p><p>prior to the war and are being completed this month. </p><p>According to WFP staff, current distributions include flour, </p><p>rice, sugar, vegetable oil, white beans, detergent, soap, </p><p>tea, salt, and infant formula.  The ration is missing </p><p>powdered milk and weaning cereal and is low in vegetable oil </p><p>stocks.  (Note:  Much of the country is currently finishing </p><p>August distributions.  End Note.)  WFP stated that even </p><p>though Al Hillah has abundant amounts of flour in the </p><p>market, most Iraqis are unable to afford this commodity at </p><p>current prices. </p><p> </p><p>12.  The MOT\'s decision to proceed with the September </p><p>distribution and October distributions was taken prior to </p><p>WFP arrival in Al Hillah.  WFP international staff first </p><p>visited Al Hillah on 13 May, as it was one of the last towns </p><p>to be approved by the U.N. Security Coordinator in the </p><p>south.  WFP is now hoping to halt an October distribution </p><p>and focus on preparations for the first countrywide </p><p>distribution that it and the MOT wants to begin in June. </p><p> </p><p>13.  WFP reported on 20 May that it had received 994 metric </p><p>tons (MT) of rice and 97 MT of wheat flour at the Al Hillah </p><p>silos.  Trucks from Jordan will now be arriving in Al Hillah </p><p>on a daily basis.  In addition, the Taji silo in Baghdad </p><p>experienced mechanical failure on 21 May.  As a result, the </p><p>trucks carrying wheat grain that were to discharge into the </p><p>Taji silo have been diverted to Al Hillah. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Although Coalition forces are now willing to allow more </p><p>than two trucks into the warehouse at one time, MOT </p><p>warehouse staff stated that they did not have the warehouse </p><p>personnel to process more than two trucks at a time. </p><p>Approximately 30 food agent trucks per day are receiving </p><p>commodities from the compound.  Trucks normally arrive at </p><p>the compound throughout the morning and continue arriving </p><p>until about 1400 hours.  WFP will address the MOT staffing </p><p>issue at the warehouse, as the Marines were also limiting </p><p>the number of total staff at the warehouse to 20.  WFP is </p><p>cleaning and making minor repair to the warehouse structures </p><p>to accommodate the significant quantities of food that are </p><p>arriving for the June distribution. </p><p> </p><p>15.  DART met with WFP national staff in the designated WFP </p><p>office space at the MOT compound.  Neither the WFP space nor </p><p>the MOT office space are in acceptable condition and both </p><p>offices are in need of clean up, refurbishment, office </p><p>furniture, computers and supplies.  WFP is bringing in </p><p>containers to serve as offices. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>SILO CAPACITY IN MOSUL </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>16.  On 18 May, the DART traveled to Mosul with WFP to meet </p><p>with the Manager of the Ninawa MOT Grain Board.  WFP </p><p>explained that it would soon be sending 136,000 MT of bulk </p><p>wheat to Mosul (from stocks currently in Syria), hoping to </p><p>move 5,000 MT per day.  WFP requested MOT assistance in </p><p>locating storage for these commodities. </p><p> </p><p>17.  The MOT confirmed that the silos could accept large </p><p>quantities beginning in early June, while WFP expressed the </p><p>hope that it could begin delivering to Mosul within one </p><p>week.  The MOT manager stated that he would meet the next </p><p>day with all the silo managers to ensure that any necessary </p><p>preparations could be achieved quickly. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Contrary to much more optimistic information WFP had </p><p>received earlier from the MOT, on 18 May the MOT noted that </p><p>a number of silos were not functional and others had been </p><p>damaged by looters after the war.  Current daily offloading </p><p>capacity and silo capacity are as follows, according to the </p><p>updated information from the MOT: </p><p> </p><p>Town             Offloading        Current storage capacity </p><p>Talafar:        1,000 MT/day           50,000 MT available </p><p>Ba\'aj:          1,000 MT/day           50,000 MT available </p><p>Mosul:            500 MT/day           14,000 MT available </p><p>Shurkat:        1,500 MT/day           50,000 MT available </p><p> </p><p>19.  While the offloading totals only 4,000 MT per day </p><p>capacity, the Mosul silo could possibly accept up to 1,500 </p><p>MT per day (instead of 500 MT per day) if milling were done </p><p>concurrently.  All storage figures are for silo complexes; </p><p>MOT said that open bins were not available since these would </p><p>be used to store the upcoming harvest. </p><p> </p><p>20.  In addition to these four silos, there remain two other </p><p>possibilities: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Makhmour silo, as reported in ref tel, has a large </p><p>storage capacity but needs some minor repairs.  The main </p><p>issue is that it lies in a contested area: technically part </p><p>of Arbil Governorate, but until a few weeks ago, under </p><p>Ninawa Governorate\'s control.  As stated in ref tel from </p><p>DART\'s 15 May visit to Makhmour, WFP will not be utilizing </p><p>this silo until the political issues have been resolved. </p><p> </p><p>B.  Shekhan silo could accept 1,000 MT per day, with </p><p>approximately 30,000 to 40,000 MT capacity available, and is </p><p>located about 55 km north of Mosul towards Dahuk.  The MOT </p><p>stated that the Shekhan silo is not in a contested </p><p>territory, as it is clearly in the Ninawa Governorate. </p><p>However, as Niawa is a Kurdish area, the Kurdish Democratic </p><p>Party has taken over the silo.  DART and WFP staff contacted </p><p>Mosul Civil Affairs personnel, who promised to send a team </p><p>to Shekhan silo the next day and report back to WFP on 22 </p><p>May. </p><p>21.  Consequently, until the problems outlined above are </p><p>resolved, WFP is looking at a maximum capacity of 4,000 MT </p><p>per day, if the silos are operating as well as the MOT </p><p>estimates.  The through-put could possibly rise for the </p><p>Mosul silo if milling were done at the same time that new </p><p>tonnage is arriving, and would certainly rise if the Shekhan </p><p>silo could be utilized.   Due to security restrictions </p><p>outside Mosul, however, WFP international staff cannot </p><p>access the other silos to confirm total and daily offload </p><p>capacities.  The DART will attempt to confirm some of the </p><p>data that was presented by the MOT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>BRIEFING THE COALITION ON PDS REQUIREMENTS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>22.  On 18 May, the DART briefed Coalition forces in Kuwait </p><p>on the history of the PDS, its importance, current plans, </p><p>and roles of the WFP and MOT. </p><p> </p><p>23.  The DART was surprised to discover that the commander </p><p>had the understanding that his troops were instructed not to </p><p>work with the U.N. agencies.  The DART not only confirmed </p><p>that cooperating with the U.N. would be helpful, but </p><p>encouraged it. </p><p> </p><p>24.  To facilitate communication, the DART asked the </p><p>Coalition forces to appoint a point of contact (POC) in each </p><p>Governorate that would serve as the liaison to WFP national </p><p>and international staff, as well as the MOT.  The CMOCs, </p><p>Civil Military Information Centers, and Humanitarian </p><p>Assistance Coordination Centers are helpful, but one point </p><p>of contact for PDS issues in each Governorate would be </p><p>extremely helpful to immediately address issues as they </p><p>arise. </p><p> </p><p>25.  Coalition forces also requested assistance in locating </p><p>and securing additional warehouses and silos.  The DART </p><p>explained the magnitude of food tonnages that are entering </p><p>the country, and that storage is critical, so that trucks </p><p>can unload quickly to decrease the turn-around time. </p><p>(Comment: Coalition forces have already begun follow-up </p><p>actions and seem quite sincere in wanting to help.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
