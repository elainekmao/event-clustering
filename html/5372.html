(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) In separate meetings on 1/21 and 1/22 with UAE Armed </p><p>Forces Chief of Staff Muhammad Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MBZ) and </p><p>de facto Foreign Minister Hamdan Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan, A/S </p><p>Burns discussed U.S. policy towards Iraq and the Middle East </p><p>peace process.  On Iraq, and clearly worried about the </p><p>unintended consequences of an armed conflict, the Emiratis </p><p>recommended that we continue force deployments and intensify </p><p>diplomatic pressure for a month or so to allow time for </p><p>possible insurrection/regime overthrow from inside Iraq.  If </p><p>we do opt for military action, our "day after" actions will </p><p>be key to shaping Arab public opinion and U.S.-Arab </p><p>relations for years to come.  Foremost among the UAE\'s </p><p>concerns is a visible U.S. commitment to Iraq\'s territorial </p><p>integrity, including forcibly resisting Kurdish and/or Shi\'a </p><p>attempts to establish independent homelands.  Although they </p><p>are "deeply discouraged" by U.S. policy towards the peace </p><p>process, the Emiratis hope to see the U.S. seriously </p><p>reengage on the Palestinian issue.  In their view, tangible </p><p>progress on this front is essential to pursuing a successful </p><p>outcome in Iraq.    The need to support Jordan figured </p><p>prominently in Burns\' discussions; his interlocutors </p><p>indicated that the UAEG prefers providing Jordan with cash </p><p>assistance and concessional loans in lieu of an oil subsidy. </p><p>Perhaps anticipating future USG requests for financial </p><p>assistance to Iraq, Hamdan explained the budgetary crunch </p><p>facing the UAEG as a result of the two-year downturn in </p><p>global financial markets.  For the first time, he explained, </p><p>the UAE is relying solely on its oil income as its return on </p><p>its investments is "zero."  Hamdan intriguingly inquired </p><p>into U.S. plans for Arab military participation in coalition </p><p>operations, noting that should Kuwait request assistance to </p><p>bolster its self-defense, the UAE and other GCC partners </p><p>would be obliged to respond positively.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Participants:  MBZ was attended by his assistant, </p><p>Yousef Al-Otaiba.  Al-Otaiba also joined for the Hamdan </p><p>meeting, along with MFA Undersecretary for Political Affairs </p><p>Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuaimi and Hamdan\'s office director, </p><p>Sultan Al-Romaithi.  The Ambassador and Polchief (notetaker) </p><p>were present at both meetings while Captain George Dom from </p><p>JCS attended the Hamdan meeting. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>MBZ:  GIVE "INSURRECTION" A CHANCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) With regard to Iraq, A/S Burns noted the President\'s </p><p>absolute determination to disarm Saddam Hussein.  Although a </p><p>final decision has not been made, Burns estimated that we </p><p>were moving inexorably closer to the point of using force as </p><p>a last resort.  He noted the near-term importance of </p><p>remaining in close contact and consultation with our friends </p><p>and allies.  Appreciative of the UAE\'s support for our </p><p>contingency planning, Burns underscored the need to keep the </p><p>pressure on Baghdad.  Burns expressed appreciation for UAE </p><p>support for contingency military requirements, and suggested </p><p>that we may need to make further requests.   The U.S., he </p><p>continued, fully understands the enormous challenges and </p><p>complexities posed by the prospect of an Iraq conflict. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) In response to a question from Burns on how Saddam </p><p>reads the U.S., MBZ said "loud and clear."  In the Chief of </p><p>Staff\'s view, the U.S. message is being received in Baghdad; </p><p>the leadership is scared and he expects that people will </p><p>start defecting.  He advised that we should provide ample </p><p>time (i.e. six weeks) for an insurrection, an option that </p><p>would save many lives and stem regional instability.  Should </p><p>military action prove unavoidable, MBZ predicted that the </p><p>north and south would fall easily.  In that event, he </p><p>recommended that the U.S. focus its efforts on Baghdad but </p><p>cautioned against street fighting and hand-to-hand combat </p><p>noting that it would be far more prudent to wait Saddam out. </p><p>A few days without food and water would sow discord among </p><p>Saddam\'s pampered cronies.  In the meantime, ordinary </p><p>Baghdadis could be taken care of through the establishment </p><p>of humanitarian centers on the city\'s outskirts. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>BURNS:  THREE-PHASE APPROACH TO IRAQ PLANNING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) In response to a question on U.S. plans regarding </p><p>the future of Iraq, Burns noted that Washington\'s thinking </p><p>had evolved considerably over the last few months and we are </p><p>actively planning for the "day after" scenario.  The Iraq </p><p>operation has been divided into three phases, Burns </p><p>explained, with the first phase focused on stabilizing the </p><p>security situation and the provision of emergency </p><p>humanitarian assistance.  Phase two would include a strong </p><p>security presence, reconstruction, and the transition to </p><p>civilian rule.  This period would witness the strengthening </p><p>of existing institutions, such as the Iraqi civil service, </p><p>and perhaps the formation of an Iraqi advisory council to </p><p>begin to prepare for restoration of full sovereignty.  We </p><p>also recognize the enormous difference between Afghanistan - </p><p>- a country stripped bare of its infrastructure and basic </p><p>institutions -- and Iraq, with its educated population base </p><p>and long history of civil society.  In phase three, Iraq </p><p>would move towards full sovereignty. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>DAY AFTER:  U.S. COMMITMENT TO IRAQI TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY </p><p>KEY FOR BUILDING CONFIDENCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Both MBZ and Hamdan asserted that U.S. handling of </p><p>the day after will affect America\'s standing in the region </p><p>for years to come.  If the U.S. is seen to be committed to </p><p>Iraq\'s territorial integrity, i.e. actively resisting </p><p>Kurdish and/or Shi\'a attempts to carve out a homeland, this </p><p>will be welcomed in the Arab world.  If we allowed a break- </p><p>up, it would destroy U.S. credibility and stature in the </p><p>region.  Burns assured his Emirati interlocutors that our </p><p>political and military strategies recognize the need to </p><p>avoid a fractured Iraq in the post-Saddam era.  MBZ </p><p>expressed slight regard for the exiled Iraqi opposition, </p><p>acidly noting that if an election were held he would be </p><p>surprised if 1 out of 100 of the oppositionists were voted </p><p>into office.  He predicted that it would be difficult to </p><p>contain the political aspirations of these exiles and that </p><p>they could easily, and publicly, turn on the U.S. in the </p><p>event that they feel their needs are not being met in the </p><p>critical transition period. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) In response to a question from MBZ on U.S. plans to </p><p>provide humanitarian assistance, Burns said we are working </p><p>closely with international agencies and looking at ways to </p><p>use existing mechanisms, such as the oil-for-food program to </p><p>meet immediate needs for water, provision of health care and </p><p>basic foodstuffs and amenities.  We realize, Burns stated, </p><p>that the Iraqis have become dependent on the UN distribution </p><p>system and the black market, both of which could collapse in </p><p>the event of a conflict. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>IRAQ-PEACE PROCESS LINKAGE:  U.S. NEEDS TO REMAIN ENGAGED </p><p>WITH ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Both Al-Nahyan brothers worried that an Iraq conflict </p><p>could trigger massive rioting and instability in the </p><p>occupied territories.  In that instance, the Emiratis fully </p><p>expect Sharon to react forcefully, thus increasing the </p><p>chances the situation would spiral out of control.  The </p><p>Emirati message was clear: active U.S. engagement on the </p><p>Palestinian issue is essential to a successful outcome in </p><p>Iraq.  Hamdan said pointedly that the UAEG, and the Emirati </p><p>people as a whole, have all but lost hope for an active </p><p>engagement and a more balanced U.S. policy.  Nevertheless, </p><p>they continue to recognize that the U.S. is an important </p><p>partner and critical to achieving a just peace.  He hoped </p><p>that Washington would pay serious attention to the desperate </p><p>situation in Israel and the territories, warning that a </p><p>conflagration on two fronts, i.e. Iraq and Palestine, would </p><p>be disastrous for the region.  Burns emphasized the </p><p>President\'s determination to push ahead toward the two-state </p><p>vision he has outlined.  Burns thanked the UAEG for its </p><p>generosity to the Palestinian people, noting that he had </p><p>personally seen how UAE funds are being used in the </p><p>rebuilding of Jenin.  The U.S. was equally concerned about </p><p>containing violence on the Lebanon-Israel border and Burns </p><p>noted he had raised the issue earlier in the day in a </p><p>meeting with Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad.  MBZ </p><p>encouraged further U.S. engagement with Syria but said it </p><p>would also be helpful if others, including the Europeans and </p><p>Arab states, made a point of meeting with Bashar to press </p><p>him to "act sensibly." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>ALL AGREE ON NEED TO SUPPORT JORDAN; UAE PREFERS CASH </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO OIL SUBSIDY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) The effect of an Iraq conflict on regional stability </p><p>was a major topic in Burns\' discussions with both Hamdan and </p><p>MBZ.  Noting the fact that King Abdullah had just visited </p><p>the UAE (where he attended an investors conference in Dubai </p><p>and met with Shaykh Zayid in Abu Dhabi), MBZ said he is most </p><p>concerned that in the event of U.S. action against Iraq, the </p><p>Jordanian street could become the point of ignition for </p><p>instability across the region.  Inflammatory Al-Jazeera </p><p>broadcasts showing Iraqi casualties as a result of a U.S. </p><p>air raid or gun battle could spark rioting in Jordan and </p><p>Egypt.  In MBZ\'s view, thought should be given to how to </p><p>manage the Arab media in the event of war; the first images </p><p>from liberated Iraq will be critical in the shaping of Arab </p><p>public opinion. </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) Burns expressed U.S. appreciation for Emirati offers </p><p>of assistance to Jordan.  The U.S. is doing its part to </p><p>bring some relief to the hard-hit Jordanian economy via an </p><p>immediate $130 million cash transfer, Burns explained. </p><p>Hamdan briefed that he is in receipt of a letter from the </p><p>Saudis proposing a Saudi-Kuwaiti-UAE offer to supply oil to </p><p>Jordan in the event of U.S./coalition action against Iraq. </p><p>He noted that the Saudis and the Kuwaitis each appeared </p><p>ready to supply 50,000 barrels a day.  If this was </p><p>sufficient to meet Jordan\'s oil need, the UAE, Hamdan noted, </p><p>preferred providing cash assistance.  He briefed that the </p><p>Abu Dhabi Development Fund had signed an agreement to </p><p>provide $50 million in project aid to Jordan and that the </p><p>UAEG had decided in the last several days to provide a </p><p>further $25 million in direct cash assistance in order to </p><p>meet immediate GOJ needs.  (Note:  It is not clear whether </p><p>this $25 million is in addition to, part of, or instead of </p><p>the $45 million in cash assistance which Hamdan briefed to </p><p>Ambassador on December 9 -- see reftel.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) Here, Hamdan paused to explain that the dramatic </p><p>downturn in the markets post 9/11 had badly hurt the UAEG\'s </p><p>overseas investment portfolio.  Where once the Emiratis </p><p>relied on their overseas income, for the first time this </p><p>year (i.e. 2002) the return on this income was zero and the </p><p>government has been been forced to rely solely on the UAE\'s </p><p>oil income.  In a conversation earlier in the week with the </p><p>Ambassador, Hamdan elaborated that the UAEG lost $30-40 </p><p>billion in its investment portfolio (estimated at between </p><p>$150-175 billion) while at the same time facing an increase </p><p>in the federal budget and the UAE\'s overseas assistance </p><p>commitments i.e. to the Palestinians, Afghans, Pakistanis, </p><p>Moroccans, Lebanese and Egyptians, to name a few. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>HAMDAN HINTS AT INVITATION FOR ARAB ALLIED MILITARIES </p><p>TO JOIN IN IRAQ CAMPAIGN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>13. (S) In an unexpected move, Hamdan inquired as to plans </p><p>to invite Arab allied militaries to join the coalition.  As </p><p>if answering his own question, Hamdan offered that were the </p><p>Kuwaitis to bring the matter before the GCC in the context </p><p>of defending Kuwait, the UAE (and other GCC partners) would </p><p>be obligated to participate under the terms of the GCC </p><p>mutual defense agreement.  Burns replied that the UAE\'s </p><p>interest would be welcomed and promised to follow up. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) This cable has been been cleared by A/S Burns. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
