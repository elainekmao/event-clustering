<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002834 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL, AF, PM AND S/CT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/11/2017 </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PTER, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: SHARIA AND ISLAMIC EXTREMISM IN KATSINA </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2830 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) The following are notes from USG officials who </p><p>participated in a week-long ATF and U.S. Customs course on </p><p>firearms interdiction in Katsina in late September (reported </p><p>reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Katsina is the state where the highly publicized </p><p>adultery case of Amina Lawal is taking place.  During their </p><p>week in the capital of Katsina, RNLEO and the ATF and U.S. </p><p>Customs trainers noted contradictions in the application of </p><p>Sharia.  A senior GON official, key to implementing the </p><p>course and well disposed to cooperation with the U.S., voiced </p><p>strong support for the Lawal stoning verdict.  He condemned </p><p>her as an adulteress who deserved to die.  If for some reason </p><p>her death sentence is overturned, he felt she should be sent </p><p>to Italy "with the others," (a reference to Nigerian women </p><p>trafficked to Italy for sexual exploitation).  This view was </p><p>shared by many other Katsina residents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Despite oft-expressed religious sentiments, the USG </p><p>visitors noted a large commercial establishment within the </p><p>city limits which serves as a "Sharia-Free Zone" (a nickname </p><p>assigned by Katsina residents). Once inside its high compound </p><p>walls, the USG visitors found beer for sale and well over a </p><p>hundred customers enjoying alcohol and dancing.  Local </p><p>prostitutes were also observed. When asked how such a glaring </p><p>exception to Sharia law could exist, locals cynically replied </p><p>that some of the ruling class had a stake in the </p><p>establishment or enjoyed its services.  A similar </p><p>contradiction was found by ATF trainers visiting the local </p><p>Post office to make telephone calls to the U.S.  Outside the </p><p>Post office was a newsstand selling a Nigerian men\'s magazine </p><p>touting sexually explicit headlines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) The USG visitors also saw evidence of extremist, </p><p>anti-U.S. sentiment -- posters, stickers and T-shirts of </p><p>Usama bin Laden on display.  During a visit to the local </p><p>market, RNLEO and lead trainer Patrick Clowry found an </p><p>Islamic bookstore with publications in English, Hausa and </p><p>Arabic.  Many of the publications, including ones on "Islam </p><p>and Jihad" and "Israel and the Arabs" were published in Saudi </p><p>Arabia, Pakistan or Northern Nigeria.  The store had no books </p><p>on Usama bin Laden, but an articulate and educated young </p><p>author running the store told the Americans that he hoped to </p><p>soon publish a manuscript on the "West\'s Conspiracy to </p><p>Suppress Islam and non-White Races" that would contain many </p><p>bin Laden quotes.  When asked why he felt it necessary to </p><p>spread anti-American sentiment, the author insisted that he </p><p>was not anti-American; instead he wished only to report "the </p><p>truth," which he added includes the KKK and Free Masons in </p><p>the "West\'s Conspiracy."  He opined that his book, once </p><p>published after he secures financial assistance, would sell </p><p>well in the Northern Nigerian environment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) In the same market, RNLEO and Clowry found Usama bin </p><p>Laden T-shirts in toddler sizes.  Some people denounced bin </p><p>Laden and claimed that many local residents bought the UBL </p><p>paraphernalia out of ignorance or to follow a fad.  However, </p><p>it seemed that some residents of Katsina understood what UBL </p><p>did and what he stood for but unfortunately were sympathetic </p><p>to him. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
