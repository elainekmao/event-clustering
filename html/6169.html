<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000612 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN - PATRICIA NORMAN, EB/TRA - SUSAN PARSON </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR JOHN MELLE </p><p> </p><p>USDOT FOR JEFF SHANE, SUSAN MCDERMOTT </p><p> </p><p>FAA FOR KRISTA BERQUIST </p><p> </p><p>TSA FOR SUSAN WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, EINV, CA, Transportation </p><p>SUBJECT: Canadian Transportation Strategy Unveiled: Aviation </p><p>Focus </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) OTTAWA 00374 (Ambassador\'s Lunch with Minister </p><p> </p><p>Collenette) </p><p>     B) OTTAWA 00385 (Air Canada Financial Woes) </p><p>     C) 02 OTTAWA 2824 (Aviation Report Recommends </p><p>Liberalization) </p><p>     D) 01 OTTAWA 0383 (Liberalization, Foreign Carriers </p><p>considered) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. The Government of Canada\'s strategic vision for </p><p>transportation policy was unveiled on February 25th, 2003. </p><p>There appear to be no radical departures from past GOC </p><p>positions; gradualism is the key note struck by the authors </p><p>of the policy statement. The policy vision addresses all </p><p>modes: air, marine, and surface (rail and road). This cable, </p><p>however, focuses exclusively on aviation issues (other modes </p><p>will be addressed septel).  From the US perspective the key </p><p>message is that GOC intends further "gradual liberalization" </p><p>of Canada\'s bilateral air agreements.  More substantive </p><p>aviation developments for the US may arrive, however, via </p><p>the "exploratory talks" which Transport Minister Collenette </p><p>and his Deputy suggested to Ambassador Cellucci (Ref A). </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Policy Vision in development since mid-2001 </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. The policy vision, with the title "Straight Ahead: A </p><p>vision for Transportation in Canada" is the final version of </p><p>the Transportation Policy Blueprint initiated in July 2001. </p><p>This effort, in turn, was precipitated by the final report </p><p>of the independent, blue-ribbon, Canada Transportation Act </p><p>Review (CTAR) panel which contained 92 recommendations to </p><p>the Minister to improve regulation of Canada\'s </p><p>transportation sector (Ref C,D).  The "Straight Ahead" </p><p>document, as well as the CTAR panel report and other </p><p>supporting documents are available on-line at the following </p><p>URL: </p><p> </p><p>http://www.tc.gc.ca/aboutus/straightahead/men u.htm </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Aviation Liberalization </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. With respect to civil aviation, the key action item of </p><p>interest to the USG is that the GoC "will continue the </p><p>gradual liberalization of Canada\'s bilateral air agreements, </p><p>using the 1995 Canada-United States Open Skies agreement as </p><p>a guide." </p><p> </p><p>4. The authors of the policy vision note that there is </p><p>continuing pressure on the government to remove restrictions </p><p>on foreign participation in Canadian domestic and </p><p>international air markets (Ref C, D) and, "under the right </p><p>circumstances, opening Canada\'s air markets to greater </p><p>external participation on a reciprocal basis could introduce </p><p>some new competition and lead to greater efficiency."  "In </p><p>the government\'s view, however, now is not the appropriate </p><p>time to undertake this step" since "the harsh realities of </p><p>the current marketplace indicate that the primary effect of </p><p>making such a significant change would be to weaken an </p><p>already vulnerable industry." </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Airport governance </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. To clarify the respective responsibilities of the </p><p>government and of airports of national significance (e.g. </p><p>Toronto, Vancouver, Dorval/Montreal, Calgary) the GoC, </p><p>intends to set out detailed rules for airport authorities to </p><p>follow respecting governance, accountability and </p><p>transparency of economic issues at national airports. </p><p>Comment: This is a welcome development, in the past both </p><p>passengers and airlines have complained about murky </p><p>accounting for the large sums of money airports acquired </p><p>through levying a variety of fees on passengers and airlines </p><p>(Ref B). End comment. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Industry comments </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. Air Canada officials are disappointed in the GoC plan. </p><p>They commented that although the new policy vision </p><p>acknowledges the unprecedented crisis in the airline </p><p>industry, the GoC has offered no concrete relief (read </p><p>direct financial aid) to the industry. </p><p>7. WestJet, the profitable low-fare operator in Canada also </p><p>appeared under-whelmed by the GoC policy vision.  The item </p><p>pitched directly to the smaller airlines was the GoC promise </p><p>to introduce laws forcing Air Canada to offer interlining </p><p>and sharing of frequent flier points, in which WestJet, as a </p><p>low-cost operator, has no interest whatsoever.  WestJet </p><p>complained that there was little consultation between the </p><p>airline and Transport Canada in the development of the </p><p>policy vision </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. With respect to civil aviation the policy vision provides </p><p>impetus for a series of low key, incremental developments, </p><p>largely administrative in nature. There will be no dramatic </p><p>moves to liberalize the aviation sector as has repeatedly </p><p>been recommended to the government by independent panels, </p><p>observers, parliamentary committees and even the GoC\'s </p><p>Competition Bureau (Refs C,D).  Indeed, the announcement in </p><p>the February 18 federal budget that the Aviation Security </p><p>Fee will be reduced from $24 to $18 per domestic round trip </p><p>far outstrips this policy vision in significance (Ref B). </p><p>More substantive ideas on aviation liberalization may have </p><p>to await discussion in any future "exploratory talks" of the </p><p>type broached during the lunch between Minister Collennette </p><p>and Ambassador Cellucci (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
