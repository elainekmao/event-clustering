<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001701 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, EAID, IT, IZ, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: ITALY NEEDS GUIDANCE ON FIELD HOSPITAL </p><p>DEPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 1679 </p><p>     B. ROME 1660 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p></p><p>THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARA 4. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT, THE PUBLIC, AND THE GOI ARE </p><p>EAGER TO SUPPORT A HUMANITARIAN MISSION TO IRAQ.  FOR THE </p><p>GOI, THE COMMITMENT OF HUMANITARIAN AID -- IMPORTANT IN AND </p><p>OF ITSELF -- ALSO PROVIDES THE JUSTIFICATION FOR PUTTING </p><p>BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN SUPPORT OF PHASE IV (REF A).  WE </p><p>THEREFORE HAVE EVERY INTEREST IN HELPING THE ITALIANS SUCCEED </p><p>WITH BOTH EFFORTS.  THE FOCUS OF THEIR EFFORTS TODAY IS ON </p><p>DEPLOYING TO IRAQ THE FIELD HOSPITAL THAT THE USG URGENTLY </p><p>REQUESTED OF ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) UNFORTUNATELY, THE GOI\'S IRAQ TASK FORCE HAS GOTTEN </p><p>AHEAD OF ITSELF IN MOVING AHEAD WITH PLANNING FOR DEPLOYING A </p><p>FIELD HOSPITAL TO A SPECIFIC SITE IN BAGHDAD (REF B) WITHOUT </p><p>PROPER COORDINATION IN TAMPA.  A SIX MEMBER SITE SURVEILLANCE </p><p>TEAM LED BY THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE MFA\'S DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE OFFICE CROSSED INTO IRAQ FROM JORDAN ON APRIL 20. </p><p>THE TEAM INFORMED THE EMBASSY IN AMMAN OF ITS TRAVEL PLANS </p><p>JUST BEFORE ENTERING, BUT FAILED TO WORK THROUGH EITHER </p><p>CENTCOM OR THIS EMBASSY IN ARRANGING THE VISIT.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE MFA, THE TEAM HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH (UNIDENTIFIED) USG </p><p>OFFICIALS IN BAGHDAD, WHO HAVE INDICATED THAT THE SITE IN </p><p>BAGHDAD IS APPROPRIATE IF HIGHER CENTCOM OFFICIALS CONCUR. </p><p>WE ARE PRESSING THE MFA TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ON THE TEAM\'S </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MOREOVER, THE TASK FORCE IS STILL HAVING PROBLEMS </p><p>WITH THE CONCEPT OF A "SELF-DEPLOYABLE/SELF-PROTECTING" FIELD </p><p>HOSPITAL.  DEFMIN MARTINO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR TODAY (SEPTEL) </p><p>    THAT WHILE A 30 MAN-CARABINIERI UNIT WOULD PROVIDE INTERNAL </p><p>SECURITY FOR THE HOSPITAL, THE GOI WILL ASK THE U.S. MILITARY </p><p>TO SECURE THE SURROUNDING PERIMETER.  WE ARE FOLLOWING UP </p><p>WITH THE TASK FORCE TO REITERATE THAT 1) CENTCOM HAS THE CALL </p><p>ON THE HOSPITAL\'S LOCATION; 2) COORDINATION WITH CENTCOM </p><p>SHOULD BE WORKED THROUGH THE ITALIAN LNO, GENERAL SANTINI, IN </p><p>TAMPA; AND 3) ITALY SHOULD PROVIDE ALL NEEDED SECURITY, BOTH </p><p>INTERNAL AND PERIMETER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ACTION REQUEST:  THE GOI, WE WERE TOLD ON APRIL 22 </p><p>(SEPTEL), MUST STILL SEEK AUTHORIZATION FROM PARLIAMENT FOR </p><p>DEPLOYING A BRIGADE-SIZE FORCE TO ASSIST WITH PHASE IV </p><p>STABILIZATION EFFORTS.  THIS WILL BE AN EASIER SELL FOR THE </p><p>GOI IF IT WILL HAVE ALREADY DEPLOYED BY THEN ITS FIELD </p><p>HOSPITAL IN A SITE ACCEPTABLE TO CENTCOM.  EMBASSY REALIZES </p><p>HOW RAPIDLY THE HUMANITARIAN PICTURE ON THE GROUND IS </p><p>CHANGING, BUT WE STILL NEED, EITHER FROM SECSTATE OR DIRECTLY </p><p>FROM CENTCOM, CONFIRMATION THAT THE GOI-PROPOSED LOCATION </p><p>(REF B) IS ACCEPTABLE.  IF IT IS NOT, WE REQUEST THAT CENTCOM </p><p>EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF SITING THE HOSPITAL NEAR BASRA, </p><p>WHERE (WE UNDERSTAND) IT IS ENVISIONED THE BULK OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN MILITARY FORCES WILL EVENTUALLY DEPLOY.  END ACTION </p><p>REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME01701 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
