END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. WFP\'S OCEAN TRANSPORT SERVICE (OTS) DELIVERED 3.9 MILLION </p><p>METRIC TONS OF COMMODITIES IN 2001.

THESE </p><p>COSTS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO THE USE OF BOTH LINERS AND BULK </p><p>CARRIERS UNDER CHARTERS AND ARE COMPONENTS OF WFP\'S FULL </p><p>COST RECOVERY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02947  01 OF 02  180802Z </p><p>PIPELINE DELIVERY ISSUES </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. WFP LOGISTICS OFFICERS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL REGIONS THAT </p><p>ARE FACING CRITICAL FOOD SITUATIONS.  THESE REGIONS ARE SUB- </p><p>SAHARAN AFRICA (THOSE COUNTRIES IMPACTED BY THE SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICAN DROUGHT, PLUS KENYA AND ETHIOPIA), THE MIDDLE-EAST, </p><p>NORTH AFRICA AND WEST ASIA (AFGHANISTAN AND THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRITORY), ASIA (INDONESIA AND THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE\'S </p><p>REPUBLIC OF KOREA), EASTERN EUROPE (ALBANIA, AZERBAIJAN AND </p><p>THE FORMER REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA), AND LATIN AMERICA </p><p>(COLOMBIA, GUATEMALA, EL SALVADOR AND PERU). </p><p> </p><p>5. WFP IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO PREVENT </p><p>PIPELINE BREAKS.  THE ORGANIZATION\'S STRATEGIES INCLUDE </p><p>INTENSIFYING ITS FUND-RAISING STRATEGIES (INCLUDING </p><p>APPROACHING THE PRIVATE SECTOR) AND ACCESSING COMMODITIES </p><p>FROM DONOR\'S PRE-POSITIONED STOCKS AT LOAD-PORTS. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, WFP WILL EXPLORE A VARIETY OF COMMODITY LOANS, </p><p>INCLUDING IN-COUNTRY LOANS, LOANS FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES </p><p>OR LOANS FROM OTHER FOOD-AID AGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>QUALITY CONTROL AND OTHER ISSUES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. THE ISSUE OF QUALITY CONTROL REGARDING COMMODITIES WAS </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED AT THE CONFERENCE.  WFP\'S LOGISTICS OFFICER FOR </p><p>WEST AFRICA RAISED QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE QUALITY OF </p><p>SECTION 416(B) COMMODITIES RELATED TO SHIPMENTS SENT TO </p><p>MAURITANIA, GAMBIA AND MALI.  HE QUESTIONED USG OFFICIALS AS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02947  01 OF 02  180802Z </p><p>TO THE QUALITY-CONTROL SAFEGUARDS UTILIZED BY THE USG AND </p><p>THE USG\'S POLICY REGARDING REPLACEMENT OF LOST OR DAMAGED </p><p>COMMODITIES.  THE USDA REPRESENTATIVE EXPRESSED CONCERN </p><p>REGARDING THIS ALLEGATION AND ASSURED CONFERENCE </p><p>PARTICIPANTS THAT USG QUALITY-CONTROL SAFEGUARDS ARE IN </p><p>PLACE AND EMPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE SHIPMENT PROCESS.  THE </p><p>USDA REPRESENTATIVE REQUESTED THAT FUTURE  CONCERNS </p><p>REGARDING THE QUALITY OF USG DONATED COMMODITIES BE REPORTED </p><p>DIRECTLY AND QUICKLY TO USG OFFICIALS.  THE LACK OF </p><p>COMMUNICATION MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO WFP HAVING THE RIGHT TO </p><p>CLAIM DIRECTLY AGAINST OCEAN CARRIERS FOR LOSS AND DAMAGE ON </p><p>USG SHIPMENTS.  THE USG ALSO STATED THAT COMMODITIES UNDER </p><p>GRANT ARE NOT NORMALLY REPLACED.  ADDITIONAL COMMODITIES </p><p>WOULD REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL GRANT. </p><p> </p><p>7. WFP\'S PRIMARY FREIGHT FORWARDER, WILSON LOGISTICS, MADE A </p><p>PRESENTATION TO THE CONFERENCE.  WILSON LOGISTICS IS A FULL- </p><p>SERVICE LOGISTICS PROVIDER OFFERING AIR, SEA AND ITNERMODAL </p><p>TRANSPORT, WAREHOUSING, DISTRIBUTION AND FULFILLMENT.

THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A GLOBAL TRACK AND TRACE </p><p>SYSTEM THAT NOT ONLY ALLOWS TRACKING SHIPMENTS, BUT ALSO </p><p>TRACING AN ORDER OR INVOICE.  THROUGH WILSON\'S SYSTEM, ONE </p><p>CAN ALSO RETRIEVE PERFORMANCE REPORTS, STATISTICS AND DATA </p><p>ANALYSIS OF THE LOGISTICS FLOW.  NOTE:  THE USG HAS IN THE </p><p>PAST EXPERIENCED SERIOUS REPORTING LAPSES FROM WILSON </p><p>LOGISTICS.  END NOTE </p><p> </p><p>8. FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL SUB-CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN USG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02947  02 OF 02  180803Z </p><p>OFFICIALS AND WFP OFFICIALS HELD IN WASHINGTON, DC, IN EARLY </p><p>APRIL 2002, THE USG REQUESTED A BRIEFING FROM WFP ON THE </p><p>SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THE FREIGHT FORWARD CONTRACT BETWEEN </p><p>WFP AND WILSON LOGISTICS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO VOUCHER </p><p>PREPARATION AND DISBURSEMENT TRACKING.  WILSON LOGISTICS\' </p><p>PRESENTATION DURING THE CONFERENCE SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP AND SET THE STAGE FOR FOLLOW-UP DISCUSSIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE U.S. MISSION AND WFP STAFF (THIS WILL BE </p><p>REPORTED SEPTEL.). </p><p> </p><p>9. THREE SEPARATE PRESENTATIONS WERE MADE DURING THE </p><p>CONFERENCE BY WFP LOGISTICS OFFICERS REGARDING INLAND </p><p>TRANSPORTATION IN VARIOUS PARTS OF AFRICA.  VARIANCES EXIST </p><p>IN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INLAND TRANSPORTATION.  THESE </p><p>VARIANCES REQUIRE A MORE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.  WITH THAT IN </p><p>MIND, USG WILL  PURSUE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY SUCH </p><p>VARIANCES EXIST WITH AN EYE TOWARDS IDENTIFYING SOME SORT OF </p><p>STANDARD COST RATE. </p><p> </p><p>10. DURING THE CONFERENCE, A SIDE MEETING WAS HELD ON THE </p><p>ISSUE OF INSURANCE FOR COMMODITY SHIPMENTS BETWEEN USG </p><p>OFFICIALS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA), </p><p>THE U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) AND </p><p>WFP OFFICIALS.  ACCORDING TO WFP OFFICIALS, WHEN THEY </p><p>RECEIVE INSURANCE RECOVERY, WFP INFORMS THE DONOR OF SUCH A </p><p>RECOVERY AND ALLOWS THE DONOR TO DECIDE HOW IT WOULD LIKE </p><p>THE RECOVERED AMOUNT TO BE HANDLED.  USDA OFFICIALS </p><p>REQUESTED ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION ON THIS PROCESS FROM WFP </p><p>AND PROMISED TO PROVIDE WFP WITH WRITTEN CLARIFICATION ON </p><p>ITS POLICY REGARDING INSURANCE, AS WELL AS ANY CLAIMS </p><p>RECOVERY HISTORY ON USDA CARGO. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02947  02 OF 02  180803Z </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. WFP\'S SHIPPING COSTS (OCEAN AND INLAND) ARE PRESENTLY </p><p>USD 260 MILLION.  US MISSION PLANS TO STEP UP THE DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH WFP SHIPPING RELATED TO MAXIMIZING COST SAVINGS AND </p><p>EFFICIENCIES.  PARTICULARLY AS WFP DECENTRALIZES WITH </p><p>REGIONAL OFFICES NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTRACTING ALL </p><p>OVERLAND TRANSPORT OPERATIONS LOCALLY, WFP NEEDS TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT ITS HEADQUARTERS CONTROL UNIT ENSURES THAT PROPER </p><p>MONITORING OF FORWARDING AGENTS AND TRANSPORTERS IS BOTH IN </p><p>PLACE AND EFFECTIVE.  MOREOVER, ADDITIONAL FOCUS IS NEEDED </p><p>ON WHAT CONSTITUTES A REASONABLE RATE FOR SURVEY CHARGES IN </p><p>INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES.
