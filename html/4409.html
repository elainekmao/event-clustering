<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ANKARA 008470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INR/R/MR, EUR/SE, EUR/PD, NEA/PD, DRL </p><p>JCS PASS J-5/CDR S. WRIGHT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, TU, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT FOR </p><p>TURKISH PRESS REACTION TO THE UN CYPRUS PLAN </p><p> </p><p>                    ------- </p><p>SUMMARY: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish press has for the most part reacted very </p><p>positively to UN Secretary General Annan\'s plan for </p><p>resolving the Cyprus issue.  Most commentators have argued </p><p>that, despite some negative aspects of the proposal, the </p><p>Annan plan is probably Turkey\'s "last and best chance" to </p><p>achieve a comprehensive settlement.  The initial cautious </p><p>official response to the plan stood in contrast to a series </p><p>of optimistic commentaries that appeared in Turkey\'s </p><p>mainstream and Islamist press.  Press analyses generally </p><p>view the Annan plan as an "historic chance" that should not </p><p>be missed.  The position of most influential Turkish media </p><p>on the Cyprus plan is perhaps best summed up by the November </p><p>16 front-page headline in the national daily "Milliyet": </p><p>"If Not Now, When?"  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENTATORS URGE NEGOTIATION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The positive press reaction to the UN plan stems from the </p><p>perception that the plan recognizes, for the first time, the </p><p>sovereignty and equality of Northern Cyprus.  Most </p><p>commentators have also noted the "disappointing" elements of </p><p>the plan, particularly with regard to territorial </p><p>concessions, refugee resettlement, and the reduction of </p><p>Turkish troops.  They also point out the inherent advantage </p><p>of the Greek Cypriots, who will become part of the EU with </p><p>or without a settlement.  While pointing out the negatives, </p><p>however, most columnists have consistently advocated a </p><p>negotiation process aimed at reaching a settlement. There is </p><p>a general consensus (with limited exceptions among </p><p>nationalist commentators) in the Turkish media that the </p><p>Annan plan should not be rejected, and that the plan\'s </p><p>shortcomings should be dealt with at the bargaining table. </p><p>Mehmet Yilmaz of "Milliyet," for example, wrote that "an </p><p>experienced leader like Denktas has the ability to perform a </p><p>diplomatic juggling act and is capable of correcting </p><p>mistakes in the plan at the negotiating table.  If Denktas </p><p>believes he does not want to discuss this plan, then I think </p><p>he should retire."  Negative public comments by Turkish </p><p>officials have been largely discounted in commentaries and </p><p>editorials.  When the nationalist daily "Ortadogu" ran a </p><p>front-page story citing former Foreign Minister Sukru Sina </p><p>Gurel\'s characterization of the plan as a "plot against the </p><p>Turkish Cypriot nation," the same paper\'s foreign policy </p><p>editor wrote on the same day that "sources close to </p><p>diplomatic circles tell us that the initial evaluation of </p><p>Kofi Annan\'s Cyprus plan was deemed  positive." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SAMPLE COMMENTARIES: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>[Following is a representative sample of Turkish </p><p>commentaries -- both positive and negative -- on the Cyprus </p><p>plan during the period November 13-19] </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Dream Might Come True in Cyprus" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief Mehmet Y. Yilmaz wrote in mass appeal </p><p>Milliyet (11/19): "The Turkish people want to see a </p><p>settlement in Cyprus.  The Turkish people want to see Turkey </p><p>in the EU.  As for the Turkish Cypriots, they do not want to </p><p>be left out while the Greek Cypriots join the European </p><p>Union.  . This common desire calls for Denktas to evaluate </p><p>the UN plan very seriously.  An experienced leader like </p><p>Denktas has the ability to perform a diplomatic juggling act </p><p>and correcting mistakes in the plan at the negotiating </p><p>table.  If Denktas believes he does not want to discuss this </p><p>plan at the negotiating table, then I think he should </p><p>retire." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Kofi Annan\'s Cyprus Plan" </p><p>Kamuran Ozbir wrote in nationalist Ortadogu (11/15): </p><p>"Sources close to diplomatic circles tell us that the </p><p>initial evaluation of Kofi Annan\'s Cyprus plan was deemed </p><p>positive, particularly because of its recognition of the </p><p>Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  There are, however, </p><p>certain elements which cause serious concern, such as </p><p>territorial concessions, property issues, and demographic </p><p>movements.  . It seems that the Turkish Foreign Ministry </p><p>will have to conduct a comprehensive study of the plan, </p><p>which might take at least a couple of days, and leave the </p><p>matter for a final decision at the upcoming National </p><p>Security Council meeting at the end of November." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Style is important on the Cyprus issue" </p><p>Ferai Tinc wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (11/15): "The </p><p>current situation calls for a diplomatic juggling act.  . </p><p>The upcoming Copenhagen summit is not only going to evaluate </p><p>the Cyprus situation in light of current developments, but </p><p>also make more binding decisions for Turkey.  The EU\'s </p><p>Accession Partnership Document clearly draws a direct link </p><p>between Turkey\'s EU process and the Cyprus issue. . We do </p><p>not mean to say `let\'s give away Cyprus and get rid of this </p><p>issue.\'  Yet we don\'t have to reject efforts for a </p><p>settlement with crude rhetoric either.  The Turkish side </p><p>should announce its readiness to negotiate the Annan plan." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What is Ankara\'s position?" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (11/15): "There are </p><p>certain parts to which the Turkish side would object, such </p><p>as the territorial concessions and demographic movements. </p><p>Yet the plan, very positively, verifies the equality and </p><p>sovereignty of the two sides -- something that we have been </p><p>working for years to achieve.  Now is the time to think </p><p>realistically and act pragmatically.  Rejection of the plan </p><p>will definitely work against the interests of Turkey as well </p><p>as Turkish Cypriots." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The UN plan is a death verdict for the TRNC" </p><p>Columnist Hasan Unal argued in Islamic-intellectual Zaman </p><p>(11/14): "The UN plan aims at liquidating the Turkish </p><p>Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a state and the </p><p>Turkish Cypriots as a nation. . It might give the impression </p><p>that it meets Turkish demands on constitutional issues, but </p><p>in fact it provides an opportunity for the founding of a </p><p>unitary Greek Cypriot state. . The plan also gives very </p><p>limited and very unproductive territory to the Turkish </p><p>Cypriots.  . In short, the UN plan expects Turkish Cypriots </p><p>to make vital concessions without meeting their ultimate </p><p>demands. Cyprus will gradually become a Greek Cypriot </p><p>island.  It is clear that Turkey\'s security guarantees will </p><p>not be valid the moment Cyprus joins the EU." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Cyprus" </p><p>Hadi Uluengin calls the UN plan a historic chance in mass </p><p>appeal Hurriyet (11/14): "Clearly this is a unique chance </p><p>for a Cyprus settlement and definitely should not be missed. </p><p>Creating excuses or making evasive remarks in order not to </p><p>take advantage of this chance would be a crucial mistake. </p><p>Whoever makes this mistake, whether it is the Turks or the </p><p>Greeks, will  be harshly judged by history. . The Annan plan </p><p>is almost perfect.  Therefore, whichever side rejects the </p><p>plan and causes the continuation of a \'no-settlement\' </p><p>situation will be doomed to deprive its people of the </p><p>opportunities coming with the new millennium." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Blending of Models" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (11/13): "The UNSG </p><p>seems to have found a middle way between `federation and </p><p>confederation\' as well as between the Swiss model and the </p><p>Belgian model for Cyprus.  Therefore, both sides will find </p><p>certain elements of this plan acceptable, and certain parts </p><p>unacceptable. . From our side, it is very important that the </p><p>Annan document complies with Turkey\'s longstanding </p><p>insistence on partnership and equality in Cyprus. . Yet </p><p>there are some negative points which the Turkish side might </p><p>not like very much, such as giving away some territory, the </p><p>migration and settlement issues, and the disarmament of the </p><p>island.  However, a constructive approach can solve these </p><p>issues through fair and just bargaining." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey should not miss this chance" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand supports the plan in mass </p><p>appeal/sensational Posta (11/13): "Turkey faces a final </p><p>historic opportunity.  Though it does not fully satisfy the </p><p>Turkish side, the Cyprus package offers extremely important </p><p>gains.  Casting aside the `We will not give away even a </p><p>pebble\' rhetoric, we must take the most we can get and close </p><p>this file.  If we allow ourselves to be slaves to our old </p><p>habits, we will lose Cyprus legally on the day after the </p><p>upcoming Copenhagen summit.  . In that case, everyone will </p><p>be bound to suffer from the harmful effects." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Annan Plan" </p><p>Semih Idiz opined in mass appeal Aksam (11/13): "It seems </p><p>that the Turkish Cypriot leadership will not burn his </p><p>bridges, but instead will continue to discuss the plan, </p><p>which is described by Turkey as `a plan with a glass of </p><p>water, half empty and half full.\'  That means the two sides </p><p>will negotiate the plan and work on the nuances. . The two </p><p>Cypriot sides will also feel pressured, because the US and </p><p>UK are strongly supporting the Annan plan behind the </p><p>scenes." </p><p></p></div>
