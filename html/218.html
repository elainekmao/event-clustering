<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOGADISHU 08032 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, PGOB, PINS, ET, UR, US, SO </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOMALI INSURGENCY:  ETHIOPIAN COMPLICITY? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 214518, (B) MOGADISHU 7910 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MEETING JULY 3 WITH ACTING </p><p>PERMSEC ABDULLAHI EGAL NUR TO PROBE A BIT </p><p>REGARDING GSDR\'S CURRENT POSITION ON ETHIOPIAN ROLE IN </p><p>NORTHERN INSURGENCY.  I HOPED IN PARTICULAR TO OBTAIN </p><p>INSIGHT INTO AMBASSADOR ADDOU\'S DEMARCHE "UNDER </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS" (REF A), IN WHICH HE SEEMED TO TAKE A </p><p>MUCH MORE FORCEFULLY CRITICAL LINE ON  ETHIOPIANS </p><p>THAN HAD PRESIDENT SIAD HIMSELF IN OUR CONVERSATION </p><p>JULY 1 (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>3.  CHOOSING HIS WORDS CAREFULLY, AMB ABDULLAHI TOLD </p><p>ME SOMALIA DID NOT CONSIDER ETHIOPIANS "CLEAN-HANDED", </p><p>BUT IT LACKED HARD EVIDENCE OF ANY SORT TO SUBSTANTIATE </p><p>ETHIOPIAN COMPLICITY.  SOMALI GOVERNMENT WAS DEEPLY </p><p>DISTURBED BY THE FACT THAT SNM FORCES HAD NOT/NOT BEEN </p><p>DISARMED BEFORE BEING EXPELLED ACROSS BORDER.  IT WAS </p><p>NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER THIS WAS A DELIBERATE </p><p>OVERSIGHT OR MERELY INADVERTENCY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AMB ABDULLAHI THEN POINTED TO "GROSS EXAGGERATION" </p><p>BY ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES OF NUMBERS OF SOMALI </p><p>REFUGEES THAT HAD REPORTEDLY FLED ACROSS BORDER TO ESCAPE </p><p>FIGHTING IN NORTHERN REGION.  ALTHOUGH ETHIOPIANS CLAMED </p><p>TO HAVE RECEIVED OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND REFUGEES, </p><p>SOMALI GOVERNMENT WAS "CERTAIN" THAT FIGURE WAS NO </p><p>HIGHER THAN THIRTY THOUSAND.  I SUGGESTED TO ABDULLAHI </p><p>THAT THIS HAD LITTLE BEARING ON QUESTION OF ETHIOPIAN </p><p>COMPLICITY WITH SNM, BUT HE CONTENDED THAT IT IMPLIED </p><p>AN ANTAGONISTIC BIAS ON ETHIOPIA\'S PART. </p><p> </p><p>5.  I ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT EVIDENCE THAT ETHIOPIA </p><p>HAD HELPED RESUPPLY SNM AFTER ATTACKS BEGAN.  HE REPLIED </p><p>THERE WAS NO/NO HARD EVIDENCE, ONLY "CIRCUMSTANTIAL" </p><p>INDICATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS I LEFT THE MEETING WITH ABDULLAHI, ESCORTED </p><p>BY PROTOCOL CHIEF ABDI HAJI, I REGISTERED MILD SURPRISE </p><p>TO THE LATTER THAT ABDULLAHI HAD NOT/NOT MENTIONED </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS TO AMB ADDOU (REF A) TO RAISE THIS ISSUE </p><p>WITH A/S CROCKER.  ABDI RESPONDED THAT HE WAS UNAWARE THA </p><p>ANY SUCH INSTRUCTIONS HAD BEEN SENT TO WASHINGTON FROM </p><p>MINISTRY.  HOWEVER, HE CONFIDED THAT ADDOU HAD TELEPHONED </p><p>PRESIDENT SIAD DIRECTLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS RECENTLY, </p><p>IMPLYING THAT INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN CONVEYED </p><p>TO ADDOU DIRECTLY BY PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ABDI HAJI ALSO VOLUNTEERED HIS SUGGESTION THAT </p><p>CROCKER SHOULD CLOSELY QUESTION SOVIET VICE MINISTER </p><p>ADAMISHIN ABOUT ETHIOPIA\'S ROLE AND WHAT SOVIETS </p><p>WERE PREPARED TO DO TO ENSURE ETHIOPIANS KEPT </p><p>HANDS OFF.  HE EXPLAINED THAT, WHEN ADAMISHIN </p><p>VISITED MOGADISHU IN APRIL, HE MADE A BIG FUSS ABOUT </p><p>WHETHER SOMALIA COULD PERSUADE USG TO SERVE AS </p><p>"GUARANTOR" OF SOMALI-ETHIOPIAN PEACE AGREEMENT. </p><p>SOVIETS, HE DECLARED, WERE PREPARED TO SIGN ON </p><p>ETHIOPIA\'S BEHALF. </p><p>- </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  JUDGING FROM WHAT I\'VE HEARD FROM </p><p>PRESIDENT SIAD AND AMB ABDULLAHI, I SUSPECT OUR </p><p>FRIEND ADDOU MAY HAVE PROMPTED THE PRESIDENT TO </p><p>ISSUE THE INSTRUCTIONS HE THEN CARRIED TO A/S CROCKER. </p><p>MORE AND MORE, IT APPEARS THAT PEOPLE AROUND SIAD </p><p>ARE PUSHING HIM IN WHATEVER DIRECTION APPEARS TO </p><p>SERVE THEIR OWN INTERESTS (OR THEIR OWN CONCEPT OF </p><p>THE NATION\'S INTERESTS), WHILE SIAD HIMSELF IS </p><p>BUFFETED BY THEIR CROSS PURPOSES.  I DO NOT/NOT BELIEVE </p><p>WE ARE ANY CLOSER THAN BEFORE TO SEEING HARD EVIDENCE </p><p>OF ETHIOPIAN COMPLICITY, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT -- </p><p>WHETHER SIAD LIKES IT OR NOT -- THE BLUSH </p><p>IS OFF OF HIS VAUNTED PEACE AGREEMENT WITH ETHIOPIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CRIGLER </p><p></p></div>
