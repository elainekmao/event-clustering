<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001719 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 7 (3/22 1845 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. Reason 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Embassy maintained a standfast posture </p><p>throughout 3/22, but will open 3/23 on a regular work </p><p>schedule.  However, American personnel will be limited to </p><p>essential movements. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Scattered demonstrations and protests occurred around </p><p>the country today, but far fewer than yesterday.  In Irbid, </p><p>the Islamic Action Front (IAF) organized a rally (ongoing as </p><p>of 1700 local) of approximately 2,000 people where a series </p><p>of speakers have been denouncing U.S. aggression against </p><p>Iraq.  PSD security personnel are present and there have been </p><p>no reports of violence.  At 1500 local time, PSD reported </p><p>that a protest involving 2,000 young people was ongoing in </p><p>the Baqa\'a Palestinian refugee camp.  The protesters have </p><p>thrown rocks at the police who have responded with teargas. </p><p>The protest remains confined to the camp.  A candlelight </p><p>vigil is planned for this evening in the Shmeisani </p><p>neighborhood of Amman.  Finally, the southern city of Ma\'an </p><p>has been quiet all day, following yesterday\'s protests that </p><p>involved several thousand people.  The PSD says that one </p><p>protester was injured in yesterday\'s demonstrations, but </p><p>denies rumors that one or more protesters may have been </p><p>killed. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Queen Alia International Airport (QAIA) continues </p><p>regular operations.  Royal Jordanian Airlines continues </p><p>service to all destinations, with the exception of Baghdad. </p><p>Air France restored its Amman-Paris route today and will </p><p>operate it on a reduced level as events and passenger loads </p><p>dictate.  It is the first European carrier to resume flights. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Mobile and fixed-line telecommunications continue </p><p>uninterrupted, although there have been occasional delays in </p><p>international service over the past few days due to the large </p><p>volume of traffic, according to local telecom officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IOM reports that one Amcit and a Japanese citizen </p><p>crossed into Jordan from Iraq today.  IOM transported them to </p><p>Ruweished, where they hired a taxi to Amman.  Inquiries to </p><p>the Consular section continue to be very light. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) None since previous sitrep. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Cooperation with all GOJ security agencies continues </p><p>to be excellent.  Additional security measures around the </p><p>Embassy remain in place, although the additional riot police </p><p>that were deployed yesterday prior to Friday prayers were </p><p>removed. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The Jordan-Iraq border remains open.  The flow of </p><p>people into Jordan continues to be light and limited to TCNs; </p><p>no Iraqi asylum seekers have yet to attempted to enter </p><p>Jordan.  Some TCNs who have crossed report that Iraqi </p><p>military forces are preventing Iraqis from leaving Iraq. </p><p>UNHCR and IOM are investigating this claim.  As of 1200 local </p><p>time 329 TCNs are at the IOM/JRCS transit camp in Ruweished. </p><p>Of this total are 229 Sudanese, 30 Somalis and a handful of </p><p>other nationalities. </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p>9. (C) Embassy IO and Centcom PA detailee briefed U.S. </p><p>reporters congregated at Ruweished on the continued dangers </p><p>of crossing into Iraqi territory.  Journalists are </p><p>increasingly frantic to get across the border, even, it </p><p>appears, in the face of our attempts to explain the dangers </p><p>of such a trip.  While at Ruweished, a local UNHCR </p><p>representative phoned IO and asked if USG could pass on any </p><p>intelligence or other information regarding movements of </p><p>Iraqis from inside Iraq toward the Iraq/Jordan border. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) CNN began running a report quoting "Kurdish sources" </p><p>that U.S. Special Forces would be landing in Northern Iraq </p><p>from Jordan.  We\'ve received a few questions for comment. </p><p>Our posture has been not to comment on the specific report. </p><p>Jordanian officials told us that they will continue to deny </p><p>such reports. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
