AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, PREVIOUSLY DISPLACED CROATS ARE APPARENTLY </p><p>ALREADY RETURNING TO THE TOWN.

ON MAY 8 AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH, POLOFFS, DAO, PAO, AND </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 30 MEMBERS OF THE ZAGREB PRESS CORPS DROVE </p><p>THROUGH FORMER SECTOR WEST, TO NOVSKA, JASENOVAC, </p><p>OKUCANI, NOVA GRADISKA AND PAKRAC.  THE FOCUS OF THE TRIP </p><p>WAS PEACEFUL REINTEGRATION, SPECIFICALLY, GOC TREATMENT </p><p>OF THE SERB POPULATION AND MILITARY PRISONERS.  IT BEGAN </p><p>WITH A TOUR OF JASENOVAC, A NOW NEARLY DESERTED TOWN </p><p>WHICH WAS THE LOCATION OF THE INFAMOUS CONCENTRATION CAMP </p><p>RUN BY THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA DURING WORLD WAR </p><p>II.  THE AMBASSADOR LAID A WREATH, ACCOMPANIED RY </p><p>PROMINENT CROATIAN SERB MILORAD PUPOVAC (WHO HAD COME AT </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR\'S INVITATION). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>LOCAL SERB OFFICIALS IN PAKRAC TELL THEIR STORY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH VELJKO DJAKULA AND OBRAD </p><p>IVANOVIC, LOCAL SERB LEADERS IN PAKRAC WHO HAD BEEN </p><p>ARRESTED BY THE CROATS LAST WEEK AND THEN RELEASED. </p><p>(NOTE: DJAKULA, A SERB MODERATE, WAS ONE OF THE SIGNERS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01796  01 OF 04  091748Z </p><p>OF THE DARUVAR AGREEMENT IN 1993 WHICH, HAD IT NOT BEEN </p><p>LOCKED BY KNIN AND BELGRADE, WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT </p><p>MODEST ECONOMIC COOPERATION RETWEEN ZAGREB AND THE SECTOR </p><p>WEST SERBS.  IVANOVIC WAS THE MAYOR OF SERB-OCCUPIED </p><p>PAKRAC.  DJAKULA SAID HIS MAIN OBJECTIVE AT PRESENT WAS </p><p>TO OBTAIN GUARANTEES OF THE LEGAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE </p><p>SERB POPULATION OF WESTERN SLAVONIA.  HE SAID THAT SERBS </p><p>ARE READY TO PEACEFULLY REINTEGRATE INTO CROATIA IF THE </p><p>GOC SHOWS THAT IT IS READY TO CARRY OUT THIS GOAL </p><p>PEACEFULLY.  ON THAT POINT, DJAKULA WAS DOUBTFUL, GIVEN </p><p>EXPERIENCES SO FAR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DJAKULA DESCRIBED EVENTS DURING THE HV OFFENSIVE AND </p><p>ACCUSED THE ARMY OF BREAKING PRIOR AGREEMENTS TO AVOID </p><p>HOSTILITIES.  HE SAID THAT, AFTER ARTILLERY FIRE BEGAN </p><p>EARLY MAY 1, SERBS IN PAKRAC TOOK WEAPONS FROM THE </p><p>COLLECTION SITES, BUT WERE ORDERED NOT TO RETURN FIRE. </p><p>THEY REQUESTED A CEASEFIRE WITH THE HV THROUGH THE UN AND </p><p>LATER THAT MORNING AGREED TO TURN OVER THEIR SMALL ARMS </p><p>WITHIN 24 HOURS AND REMAINING HEAVY WEAPONS IN 4 DAYS. </p><p>REPEATED REQUESTS FOR MEETINGS TO FINALIZE THE WRITTEN </p><p>GUARANTEES, HOWEVER, WERE DELAYED RY THE CROATS UNTIL </p><p>AROUND 1400 HOURS WHEN ARTILLERY FIRE ERUPTED FROM ALL </p><p>SIDES.

SERBS WERE SCARED THAT THOSE WHO </p><p>SURRENDERED WERE BEING SHOT BY CROAT SOLDIERS EXACTING </p><p>REVENGE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01796  02 OF 04  091827Z </p><p>7.  DJAKULA CLAIMED TO HAVE HEARD THAT THE UN WAS </p><p>INVESTIGATING WAR CRIMES IN THE AREA.  HE ALSO REPORTED </p><p>ONE INCIDENT HE HAD HEARD ABOUT IN WHICH A TRUCK SEEKING </p><p>TO FLEE AT NIGHT FROM ADVANCING CROATIAN FORCES HAD BEEN </p><p>FIRED UPON AND 7 OF ITS EIGHT OCCUPANTS KILLED.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR IN TURN INFORMED HIM OF THE INCIDENT NEAR THE </p><p>SAVA RIVER BRIDGE WHERE A GROUP OF CIVILIANS HAD BEEN </p><p>KILLED UNDER AS YET TO BE EXPLAINED CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p>DJAKULA HAD APPARENTLY NOT YET HEARD OF THE INCIDENT.  HE </p><p>CITED A SEPARATE CASE WHERE A SMALL NUMBER OF CIVILIANS </p><p>WERE KILLED BY AN HV PATROL. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE AMBASSADOR ASSURED DJAKULA THE USG WOULD DO ITS </p><p>BEST TO INVESTIGATE BOTH OF THESE INCIDENTS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND DJAKULA AGREED THAT UNHCR AND ICRC SHOULD </p><p>BE MONITORING RELEASES.  ADDITIONALLY, DJAKULA STATED </p><p>THAT THERE WERE A FEW PROMINENT LOCAL SERBS IN JAIL IN </p><p>BJELOVAR: MLADEN KULIC, COLONEL HARAMBASIC, SAVO </p><p>RADOSEVIC.  HE SAID HE HAD HEARD THAT KULIC HAD BEEN </p><p>BEATEN.  (NOTE: EMBASSY WILL MAKE A FOLLOWUP VISIT MAY 9 </p><p>TO SEE THESE INDIVIDUALS--AS WELL AS OTHER DETAINEES. </p><p>REFCOORD WILL ALSO BE CHECKING WITH UNHCR AND ICRC TO SEE </p><p>WHETHER THEY ARE MONITORING THE STATUS OF RELEASED </p><p>PRISONERS.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  INFLUENTIAL CROATIAN SERB LEADER MILORAD PUPOVAC ALSO </p><p>ATTENDED THE AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH DJAKULA.  PUPOVAC </p><p>SAID THAT A NUMBER OF ISSUES MUST BE ADDRESSED FOR ZAGREB </p><p>TO BUILD CONFIDENCE WITH ITS SERB COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>--DETAINEES, WHETHER CIVILIAN OR MILITARY, MUST BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01796  02 OF 04  091827Z </p><p>RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES. </p><p> </p><p>--THE HV MUST WITHDRAW AND BE REPLACED BY AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>--THE DISCUSSION ON HOW TO GUARANTEE SERB RIGHTS MUST BE </p><p>STARTED NOW. </p><p> </p><p>--SERBS MUST BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH CROATIAN </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND WHAT IT OFFERS THEM. </p><p> </p><p>--SERBS IN FORMER SECTOR WEST NEED TO FORGE STRONG TIES </p><p>TO SERBS IN THE REST OF CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>--THE GOC MUST SHOW THAT IT RESPECTS ITS OWN LAWS AND </p><p>APPLIES THEM FAIRLY TO THE SERB COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHAT KIND OF GUARANTEES SERBS </p><p>WOULD NEED TO CONVINCE THEM TO STAY IN CROATIA.  DJAKULA </p><p>SUGGESTED A CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE AND </p><p>EVENTUALLY SOME KIND OF AUTONOMY UNDER A POLITICAL </p><p>SOLUTION.  SERBS IN WESTERN SLAVONIA WOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>DEPEND ON UNHCR AND ECMM AS GUARANTORS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR TOLD DJAKULA THAT THE U.S. SUPPORTS A </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ5769 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5769 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01796  03 OF 04  091827Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   ARA-01   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  OASY-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-01    FBIE-00  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-10 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-01     ADS-00   NEA-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   PA-01 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SCT-00   SP-00    SR-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-01    SNIS-00  NISC-01 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRME-01  PRMC-01  DRL-09   G-00       /036W </p><p>                  ------------------C3CB5B  091828Z /38 </p><p>O 091845Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5708 </p><p>INFO CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XP/IN// </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J5-PMA/J21// </p><p>COM SIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY AMMAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY KATHMANDU </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUENOS AIRES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01796  03 OF 04  091827Z </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>USNMR SHAPE BE//POLAD// </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>HQUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5// </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 ZAGREB 001796 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR DS/OP/EUR </p><p>VIENNA FOR BOSNIA; USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: MOPS PHUM PGOV HR </p><p>SUBJECT:  CROATIA UPDATE NO. 28: AMRASSADOR\'S TRIP TO </p><p>          FORMER SECTOR WEST, MAY 8 </p><p> </p><p>CONTINUED UNCRO PRESENCE IN THE SECTOR ALONGSIDE CIVIL </p><p>CROATIAN AUTHORITIES.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE SECTOR </p><p>SHOULD BE DEMILITARIZED ONCE SECURITY HAD BEEN </p><p>ESTABLISHED.  DATT NOTED THAT THE AMBASSADOR\'S PARTY WAS </p><p>FORCED TO DETOUR BETWEEN NOVSKA AND OKUCANI BECAUSE OF A </p><p>FIREFIGHT AND ASKED IF DJAKULA KNEW OF ANY SERB UNITS </p><p>STILL OPERATING IN THE AREA, BECAUSE THAT WOULD PROVIDE A </p><p>PRETEXT FOR A CONTINUED HV PRESENCE.  DJAKULA KNEW OF NO </p><p>ORGANIZED RESISTANCE AND SUGGESTED THERE WERE STILL </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE AFRAID TO SURRENDER. </p><p> </p><p>11.

DJAKULA BELIEVED THAT FEAR AND SELF-INTEREST </p><p>WOULD BALANCE EACH OTHER AND BRING PEACE.  SERBS WHO </p><p>WILLINGLY RETURNED TO THE AREA WOULD NOT COME BACK TO </p><p>MAKE TROUBLE, BUT BY NECESSITY WOULD BE COMMITTED TO </p><p>SOLVING PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNITIES.  HOWEVER, </p><p>DJAKULA SAID HE WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO TELL PEOPLE TO </p><p>RETURN OR STAY BECAUSE HE WOULD BE BLAMED IF ANYBODY WAS </p><p>MISTREATED.  HE COULD NOT TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF </p><p>LEADING THE COMMUNITY INTO THE UNKNOWN BECAUSE EVERY </p><p>WRONG STEP WOULD BE USED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES BY KNIN, </p><p>PALE, AND ZAGREB.  SERBS MUST MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES </p><p>INDIVIDUALLY.  ULTIMATELY, MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY </p><p>WANT TO REMAIN, BUT THE SERBS NEEDED A COOLING OFF </p><p>PERIOD.  WHAT DJAKULA TERMED "PRESSURE" BY THE GOC  ON </p><p>PEOPLE TO MAKE A DECISION IMMEDIATELY ON WHETHER THEY </p><p>WERE STAYING OR GOING WAS EXCESSIVE.  (NOTE: ACCORDING TO </p><p>DJAKULA, 95 PERCENT OF THE SERBS IN THE PAKRAC AREA HAVE </p><p>STAYED IN THEIR HOMES.)  ONLY WHEN GUARANTEES THAT HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS WOULD BE PROTECTED WERE DEMONSTRATED WOULD HE MAKE </p><p>A DECISION ABOUT TAKING HIS OWN CROATIAN CITIZENSHIP </p><p>PAPERS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>ELDERLY DETAINEES STILL HELD </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE AMBASSADOR\'S PARTY VISITED A GYMNASIUM IN NOVA </p><p>GRADISKA WHICH IS SERVING TO HOLD ABOUT 150-200 MOSTLY </p><p>ELDERLY DETAINEES FROM THE OKUCANI AREA.

POLOFF TALKED TO A FEW </p><p>OF THE DETAINEES WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN WELL TREATED BY </p><p>POLICE AND RECEIVED GOOD FOOD AND MEDICAL CARE FOR THE </p><p>FIRST TIME IN YEARS.  WHILE WE WERE AT THE SITE, RELIEF </p><p>WORKERS WERE BRINGING IN FRESH BREAD.  THESE DETAINEES </p><p>WERE, HOWEVER, BORED AND WANTED TO GO HOME; THEY HAD NO </p><p>IDEA WHEN THE POLICE WOULD LET THEM LEAVE.  AT LEAST A </p><p>FEW WERE UNCERTAIN WHETHER THEY WOULD ACCEPT THE GOC </p><p>OFFER TO REMAIN IN CROATIA OR LEAVE FOR BOSNIAN SERB </p><p>TERRITORY.  IN CONTRAST TO THE ELDERLY SERBS STILL BEING </p><p>DETAINED, FORMERLY DISPLACED CROATS REPORTEDLY ARE </p><p>ALREADY BEING RETURNED TO OKUCANI TO REPAIR AND REOPEN </p><p>BUSINESSES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>LOOTING IN OKUCANI </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.
