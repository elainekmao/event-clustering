<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 002239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DRL/IRF (FARR), INR (CURRY), EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KIRF, PHUM, KIRF, VT, RU, VTPREL, RU </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN MFA TICKED OFF AT RUSSIANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) CURRY/FROWICK EMAIL 04/29/02 </p><p>     B. B) KOSTELANCIK/FROWICK EMAIL 04/29/02 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON, REASON E.O. 12958 1.5 (B), (D) </p><p>. </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C)  SUMMARY: VATICAN MFA RUSSIA DIRECTOR TRICARICO IS </p><p>UNHAPPY AND AGITATED ABOUT THE GOR REFUSAL OF VISAS TO </p><p>CATHOLIC CLERGY, ESPECIALLY TO BISHOP MAZUR.  HE BELIEVES THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE GOR MUST HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE NEW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02239  01 OF 02  081446Z </p><p>POLICY TO REJECT CATHOLIC CLERGY VISAS.  HE SAID THE POPE AND </p><p>HIS CHURCH WANT RECONCILIATION WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX, BUT </p><p>THAT AFTER 80 YEARS OF PERSECUTION AND A FURTHER DECADE OF </p><p>ONE-SIDED ATTEMPTS AT RAPPROCHEMENT, THEY HAVE YET TO SEE </p><p>PROGRESS.  NEVERTHELESS, THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE ITS </p><p>MINISTRY IN RUSSIA, AND CONTINUE TO PURSUE A RAPPROCHEMENT </p><p>WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>AGITATED OVER VISA REFUSALS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLOFF MET 05/02 WITH VATICAN MFA RUSSIA/NIS DIRECTOR </p><p>ARCHBISHOP ALBERTO TRICARICO TO DISCUSS VATICAN/RUSSIAN </p><p>RELATIONS IN WAKE OF EXPULSION OF TWO CLERGY MEMBERS IN </p><p>RECENT DAYS.  TRICARICO, ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR OF VATICAN </p><p>MFA "COUNTRY DIRECTORS," WAS AGITATED, SAYING THE HOLY SEE </p><p>HAD BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO ACCOMMODATE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>PATRIARCH ALEXIY, BUT THERE HAD BEEN NO POSITIVE RESPONSE. </p><p>HE SAID THE GOR AVERRED CANCELLATION OF VISAS FOR THE TWO </p><p>CLERGY WAS AN ACT OF "SOVEREIGNTY," BUT THE VATICAN WAS STILL </p><p>WAITING FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE LEGAL BASIS FOR IT.  HE WAS </p><p>PARTICULARLY UPSET THAT THE GOR HAD DENIED BISHOP MAZUR THE </p><p>RIGHT TO RETURN TO HIS FLOCK.  TRICARICO UNDERSCORED THAT THE </p><p>REFUSAL OF A VISA TO A BISHOP WAS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY BY THE </p><p>VATICAN -- IN THIS CASE IT WAS A "HISTORICAL ACT" WHICH </p><p>DEFIED THE HOLY SEE\'S 1989 AGREEMENT WITH THE SOVIET UNION ON </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  HE BELIEVED THAT THE GOR WOULDN\'T REFUSE </p><p>A VISA TO A BISHOP WITHOUT HIGHEST LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>KNOWING. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02239  01 OF 02  081446Z </p><p>3.  (C)  TRICARICO SAID THE HOLY SEE HAD PROTESTED THE </p><p>EXPULSION OF ITS CLERGY AT THE OSCE.  WE ASKED HIM ABOUT THE </p><p>RUSSIAN OSCE AMBASSADOR\'S COMMENT THAT MAZUR\'S VISA REFUSAL </p><p>WAS LINKED TO THE USE OF THE OLD JAPANESE NAME FOR SAKHALIN </p><p>DIOCESE\'S SOUTHERN DISTRICT (REF B).   TRICARICO SAID THAT </p><p>WAS SPECIOUS.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE CHURCH HAD CALLED THAT </p><p>DISTRICT KARAFUTO SINCE 1938, AND THAT IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE </p><p>DECISION BY THE POPE TO MAKE THE FOUR DIOCESES OFFICIAL THAT </p><p>THEY HAD HEARD ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT IT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>TRICARICO ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RUSSIA </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  TO PUT THE CHURCH\'S SITUATION IN RUSSIA INTO </p><p>PERSPECTIVE, TRICARICO SAID IT NEEDS 100\'S OF BISHOPS, BUT </p><p>ONLY HAS FOUR.  HE AGREED WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPAL THAT </p><p>CLERGY SHOULD BE NATIONALS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY </p><p>MINISTER, AND NOTED THAT THERE ARE NOW 74 SEMINARIANS IN THE </p><p>ST. PETERSBURG SEMINARY.  OVER TIME, HE FORECAST, FOREIGN </p><p>CLERGY WON\'T BE NEEDED.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH </p><p>WAS DOING LOTS OF SOCIAL WORK IN RUSSIA, WITH HOSPITALS, </p><p>SCHOOLS AND SOCIAL CENTERS FOR PENSIONERS.  GIVEN THIS, MANY </p><p>IN THE VATICAN FEEL PARTICULARLY BETRAYED BY THE GOR\'S </p><p>ACTIONS AFTER THE CREATION OF THE FOUR RUSSIAN DIOCESES. </p><p>TRICARICO REPEATEDLY ASSERTED THAT CATHOLICS HAD BEEN </p><p>PERSECUTED IN RUSSIA FOR 80 YEARS, THROWN INTO THE GULAG, AND </p><p>MANY MARTYRED, AND "THIS IS OUR REWARD?" </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  TRICARICO SAID THAT THE POPE SINCERELY WISHED FOR A </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX; HE WOULD GIVE UP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02239  01 OF 02  081446Z </p><p>ANYTHING "SAVE THE FREEDOM" OF HIS CATHOLIC FLOCK TO PRACTICE </p><p>THEIR  FAITH.  BUT DESPITE ALL THE APOLOGIES FOR HISTORICAL </p><p>TRANSGRESSIONS, THE OUTREACH TO ORTHODOX CHURCHES IN OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES, THE DISCRETION THAT CATHOLICS PRACTICED IN RUSSIA </p><p>(I.E. MAKING RUSSIANS WHO WISH TO CONVERT TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS </p><p>OF REFLECTION BEFORE ACCEPTING THEM TO THE CHURCH), PATRIARCH </p><p>ALEXIY AND THE ORTHODOX OFFER NAUGHT BUT A STONEWALL. </p><p>TRICARICO AVERRED THAT THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CLERGY SUFFERED </p><p>FROM "SOCIALIST WAYS OF THINKING; THEY WERE ALL COLLABORATORS </p><p>IN PAST AND CAN\'T SHAKE OLD WAYS" (PLEASE STRICTLY PROTECT). </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>WHAT NEXT? </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) FOR NOW, BISHOP MAZUR IS COOLING HIS HEELS AT HIS OLD </p><p>PARISH IN WARSAW.  THE POPE IS HOPEFUL THAT ANY MOMENT THINGS </p><p>WILL BREAK, AND MAZUR WILL BE PERMITTED TO RETURN.  TRICARICO </p><p>DID NOT MENTION WHETHER CAPRIO MIGHT RETURN TO MOSCOW.  WE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9723 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  02239  02 OF 02  081447Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  PERC-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    EPAE-00  DSCC-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------ABB476  081447Z /38 </p><p>O 081430Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY MOSCOW PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 002239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DRL/IRF (FARR), INR (CURRY), EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KIRF, RU, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN MFA TICKED OFF AT RUSSIANS </p><p> </p><p>REMINDED HIM OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, NOTING THAT WE HAD A REGULAR CHANNEL WITH </p><p>THE VATICAN ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUES.  SAYING "THANK GOD </p><p>FOR AMERICA -- THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND UP AND TALK </p><p>ABOUT THESE ISSUES," TRICARICO INDICATED HE WOULD WELCOME AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE VIEWS WITH THE NEW AMBASSADOR AT LARGE </p><p>OR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IF AND WHEN HE VISITS </p><p>VATICAN CITY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: POST HAS OBSERVED ARCHBISHOP TRICARICO TO BE </p><p>MORE EMOTIONAL IN HIS DISCOURSE THAN ARE MOST OTHER VATICAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02239  02 OF 02  081447Z </p><p>COUNTRY DIRECTORS.   PERHAPS BECAUSE OF HIS AGE (HE WILL TURN </p><p>75 LATER THIS YEAR AND SUBMIT HIS RESIGNATION) HIS VIEWS ON </p><p>THE ORTHODOX CLERGY\'S "COLLABORATIONIST" PROCLIVITIES ARE </p><p>SHARPENED.  PRIOR TO TAKING MFA RESPONSIBILITIES FOR RUSSIA </p><p>AND THE NIS COUNTRIES, TRICARICO HAD BEEN NUNCIO IN S/E ASIA </p><p>FOR MYANMAR AND LAOS, AND HAD SERVED IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN </p><p>NUNCIATURES.  WHILE TIRCARICO SOUNDED TO US SOMEWHAT </p><p>CONFRONTATIONAL ON THE RUSSIAN ISSUES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>VATICAN ITSELF WILL, TRUE TO FORM, TAKE A LONG VIEW OF THE </p><p>PROBLEM AND WORK PATIENTLY AND DISCRETELY TO ADVANCE ITS </p><p>INTERESTS. EMBASSY CONVERSATIONS WITH RUSSIAN EMBASSY AND </p><p>ORTHODOX CHURCH REPRESENTATIVES IN ROME WILL BE REPORTED </p><p>SEPTEL. </p><p>NICKOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA02239 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
