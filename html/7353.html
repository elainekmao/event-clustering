<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002353 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: DIFFICULTIES FROM PARLIAMENT\'S HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 549 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 808 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Trouble continues with ruling AK party </p><p>parliamentary Human Rights Committee Chairman Elkatmis </p><p>regarding Iraq-related anti-American statements he persists </p><p>in making to the press, statements which (1) are at odds with </p><p>the AK government line; (2) reflect the committee\'s refusal </p><p>to tackle domestic human rights issues; and (3) demonstrate </p><p>strains within AK party.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Charges of "Massacre" </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) April 4 we called on Mehmet Elkatmis, an AK Party M.P. </p><p>and Chairman of Parliament\'s Human Rights Committee, to </p><p>discuss recent articles attributing anti-American statements </p><p>to him.  Elkatmis confirmed he had responded to reporters\' </p><p>questions by saying U.S. and UK leaders "could be" brought </p><p>before a war crimes court for their role in Operation Iraqi </p><p>Freedom, and the conflict in Iraq is not war but "savagery" </p><p>and a "massacre."  Defending his comments at length but in an </p><p>unfocused fashion, Elkatmis charged that Iraqi civilians have </p><p>been killed and missiles had landed on Turkish soil during </p><p>the conflict. "One bombing of a marketplace might be a </p><p>mistake," he said, "but four or five?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Post Rebuttal </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We emphasized the considerable lengths Coalition </p><p>forces have gone to in order to avoid civilian casualties. </p><p>Did Elkatmis, by using the word "massacre" (katliam), mean to </p><p>charge Coalition forces with having deliberately targeted </p><p>civilians?  Elkatmis refused to give a straight answer.  In </p><p>noting that the U.S. respects the right of anyone freely to </p><p>express his views, we then underscored that (1) we take words </p><p>seriously, particularly when they come from a senior M.P.; </p><p>and (2) such statements -- which Elkatmis volunteered were </p><p>based in part on regional TV reporting -- do a disservice to </p><p>USG-GOT and USG-AK relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We noted that on the same day Elkatmis\' comments </p><p>appeared in the press, FM Gul was quoted as saying Turkey is </p><p>"part of the Coalition."  PM Erdogan also recently placed a </p><p>column in the Wall Street Journal emphasizing the importance </p><p>of Turkey\'s alliance with the U.S.  Elkatmis\' comments thus </p><p>appeared to contradict the policies of the AK party and </p><p>government.  Moreover, Elkatmis is not the head of an </p><p>independent NGO but rather a prominent M.P.  His public </p><p>statements consistently focus on supposed human rights </p><p>problems in other countries, rather than in Turkey.  How </p><p>should the USG interpret this approach?  In a meandering </p><p>response, Elkatmis claimed to support Turkey\'s alliance with </p><p>the U.S., but argued that as Human Rights Committee Chairman </p><p>he speaks in defense of human rights around the world, not as </p><p>an AK or GOT representative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Unhappy Camper </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) April 9 "Sabah" daily published an account of the </p><p>meeting in which Elkatmis distorted both the spirit and </p><p>content of the exchange.  In response to our subsequent </p><p>expressions of regret that Elkatmis had misrepresented the </p><p>meeting, senior AK officials observed to us that Elkatmis has </p><p>been a growing problem for the party and that he would be </p><p>"warned."  AK Deputy Chairman for Public Relations Mercan </p><p>called April 10 to offer apologies, and said the party has </p><p>asked Elkatmis to make his own personal apology. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Elkatmis, an Embassy contact since 1996 and member of </p><p>the more hard-core Islamist tendency in AK, has been a useful </p><p>interlocutor in the past.  However, this misstep, and a </p><p>previous attempt by him to contribute to a smear campaign </p><p>alleging USG support for the PKK (ref A), reflect the </p><p>generally low quality and still embryonic understanding of </p><p>democratic institutions shared by Elkatmis and other members </p><p>of the Human Rights Committee.  In this context, we note that </p><p>Elkatmis and other Committee members: (1) profess to believe </p><p>that the Committee\'s work is somehow unconnected to the wider </p><p>traffic of parliamentary activity and USG-GOT relations -- </p><p>despite their own sensitivities about U.S. Congressional </p><p>attitudes towards Turkey; and (2) appear to derive </p><p>considerable inspiration from fiery Speaker of Parliament </p><p>Bulent Arinc, who has made no secret of his ambitions to </p><p>challenge Erdogan for leadership of AK (ref B). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
