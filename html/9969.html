<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 07 TEGUCIGALPA 001868 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC, AND WHA/EPSC </p><p>STATE FOR PM, INL, EB, AND CA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: OVIP, MARR, MASS, MOPS, PREL, PGOV, SNAR, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR CJCS GENERAL MYERS\' VISIT TO </p><p>HONDURAS AUGUST 13 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Roger D. Pierce; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Honduran President Ricardo Maduro, nearing </p><p>the half-way point of his constitutionally mandated single </p><p>four-year term, faces numerous challenges in one of the </p><p>poorest and most corrupt countries in the Western Hemisphere. </p><p> His Administration has been stalled on its domestic agenda </p><p>since June of last year and has mustered little progress as </p><p>it tries to reconcile its ambitious goals to its </p><p>straitjacketed financial situation.  Bilateral relations </p><p>between the U.S. and Honduras are excellent; Honduras was the </p><p>first country in the Western Hemisphere to sign and ratify an </p><p>ICC Article 98 Agreement with the United States.  Honduras\' </p><p>support for the international counterterrorism effort is </p><p>steadfast and the Government of Honduras (GOH) is sending </p><p>troops to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The </p><p>United States and Honduras have maintained a long-standing </p><p>close relationship framed by such events as the establishment </p><p>of the banana plantations in the late 1800s, the Contra wars </p><p>of the 1980s, and reconstruction efforts in the wake of the </p><p>October 1998 fury of Hurricane Mitch.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Key Issues in Bilateral Relationship </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The central themes in our bilateral diplomatic efforts </p><p>in Honduras are combating international crime by </p><p>strengthening governance and attacking corruption, assisting </p><p>American citizens, fostering economic development, promoting </p><p>regional stability, promoting trade and investment, and </p><p>combating terrorism.  However, the underlying difficulty to </p><p>realizing USG objectives is improving the administration of </p><p>justice and rule of law.  President Ricardo Maduro\'s </p><p>government is rhetorically committed on all of these issues, </p><p>but has made very little substantive headway in addressing </p><p>the myriad problems Honduras faces.  While Maduro has also </p><p>spoken out strongly on tackling corruption, he faces </p><p>formidable challenges from entrenched economic and political </p><p>interests in moving his agenda forward. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Status of the Maduro Government </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) President Maduro is facing increasing criticism from </p><p>the political opposition over his government\'s policies and </p><p>continued dissatisfaction from his own party\'s Members of </p><p>Congress because of his Administration\'s technocratic style. </p><p>The Honduran Congress is a focal point of political </p><p>opposition to his policies.  It is a corrupt institution </p><p>riddled with avaricious politicians, and Maduro\'s National </p><p>Party does not control a majority of the unicameral body. </p><p>Maduro recently lost his coalition partner, the Christian </p><p>Democrats, who had given Maduro a majority in Congress.  The </p><p>ongoing problems within his own party are serious and </p><p>threaten his broader political agenda, which will require </p><p>legislation to advance.  Continuing political negotiations </p><p>will be needed to manage this situation.  Maduro\'s personal </p><p>life also intruded into the political sphere.  His October </p><p>2002 wedding to a Spaniard was criticized by many Hondurans </p><p>who viewed the President as distracted by his personal life. </p><p>A recent public squabble has not helped the situation. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The President\'s standing has remained stalled at a </p><p>low point since June 2002.  Faced with slow progress in his </p><p>efforts to promote regional economic integration, Maduro\'s </p><p>team is pinning its hopes that a U.S.-Central American Free </p><p>Trade Agreement (CAFTA) can serve as a catalyst to regional </p><p>economic cooperation.  Maduro is also beginning to hear wider </p><p>disillusionment among the Honduran public as violent crime </p><p>levels are increasing once again despite his initial "zero </p><p>tolerance" law and order campaign.  Notwithstanding his </p><p>crackdown on street crime, criminal investigations are </p><p>usually inadequate and case closure rates, in particular for </p><p>homicides, remain very low. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Counterterrorism Cooperation </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) Maduro is a good and reliable friend of the U.S. on </p><p>counterterrorism.  His government hosted a major U.S. </p><p>military counterterrorism exercise in March 2002 and has </p><p>quickly responded with freeze orders to all U.S. requests </p><p>regarding suspect terrorist bank accounts.  No terrorist </p><p>assets have been found in Honduran financial institutions, to </p><p>date.  The GOH still needs to take the following concrete </p><p>steps: designate a national coordinator for counterterrorism, </p><p>file its national report in accordance with United Nations </p><p>Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1373, and most of all, </p><p>sign and/or ratify the five outstanding international </p><p>conventions/protocols and two OAS conventions (1971 and 2002) </p><p>against terrorism.  It is also of vital importance for </p><p>Honduras to improve security at its maritime ports, </p><p>particularly Puerto Cortes. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The GOH is in general supportive of key USG foreign </p><p>policy goals and is a member of the Coalition of the Willing. </p><p> In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the GOH will deploy </p><p>some 370 troops to the vicinity of An Najaf as part of the </p><p>Spanish Brigade operating under the Polish Division.  The </p><p>troops are currently scheduled to depart Honduras for Spain </p><p>on August 10-13.  After approximately a week in Spain, they </p><p>will deploy in conjunction with the other Central American </p><p>units from El Salvador, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic </p><p>through Kuwait to Iraq.  Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) </p><p>negotiations are still ongoing between the GOH and the </p><p>Government of Kuwait (GOK).  In the interim, The GOK has </p><p>given the GOH authority to transit Kuwait under the blanket </p><p>USG SOFA, however this is not an ideal solution. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Bilateral Political/Military Issues </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In January of 1999, the constitution was amended to </p><p>abolish the position of military commander in chief of the </p><p>Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF), thus codifying civilian </p><p>authority over the military.  Honduras now has a civilian </p><p>Minister of Defense (MOD) and a Chief of the Joint Staff who </p><p>heads the HOAF.  Civilian control is well accepted by the </p><p>HOAF, and the transition to civilian control has resulted in </p><p>greater transparency and fiscal accountability.  The current </p><p>MOD, Fred Breve, enjoys a good relationship with the HOAF </p><p>military leadership, but the Office of the Minister of </p><p>Defense still lacks a staff that could provide institutional </p><p>memory and continuity between the change in political </p><p>administrations. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Honduras was the first country in all the Western </p><p>Hemisphere to sign and ratify an Article 98 Agreement with </p><p>the USG.  President Maduro, despite domestic political and </p><p>some regional opposition, has also consistently supported </p><p>overall USG foreign policy objectives, particularly U.S. </p><p>efforts to create a stable and peaceful Iraq.  President </p><p>Maduro and his military advisors are very aware that </p><p>Nicaragua and El Salvador have received FMF funds and </p><p>question why Honduras, even though it has been a staunch </p><p>political and military supporter in the region, has not </p><p>received any funds for many years. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) In January of 02, Honduras formally requested 6 </p><p>UH-1H helicopters through the EDA program.  However, due to </p><p>changes in US law, the cost of 6 EDA helos rose from about </p><p>USD 700,000 to USD 4.2 million - an amount the GOH was unable </p><p>to afford.  The original LOA expired some three months ago. </p><p>This week, however, MOD Breve renewed his request for UH-1H </p><p>helicopters, and also asked if there was way to get them </p><p>either free (ie under section 516 as grant aid at no cost to </p><p>the GOH), or at an extended payment plan, i.e. 15 years.  The </p><p>AMB and country team strongly support any assistance in this </p><p>area as a principal use for these helos is to support </p><p>counternarcotics operations.  The current Honduran fleet of </p><p>UH-1H helicopters is in poor condition with a limited life </p><p>expectancy. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Soto Cano Air Base - Joint Task Force Bravo </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Five hundred fifty-eight U.S. service men and women </p><p>and eight civilian DOD employees are stationed at Honduras\' </p><p>Soto Cano Air Base under the auspices of SOUTHCOM as Joint </p><p>Task Force Bravo.  In 1954, the USG and GOH signed a </p><p>Bilateral Military Assistance Agreement that set forth their </p><p>intention to work closely together to foster peace and </p><p>security in the Western Hemisphere.  The ICC Article 98 </p><p>Agreement with Honduras is therefore a particularly important </p><p>accomplishment and will enable our military forces to </p><p>continue to work together in such areas as disaster relief, </p><p>joint training exercises, and counternarcotics missions. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Cerro La Mole Radar </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In 1993, the U.S. entered into an agreement with the </p><p>GOH regarding the maintenance of the radar located at Cerro </p><p>La Mole, under which the U.S. military agreed to pay 75 </p><p>percent of maintenance costs up to USD 400,000 per year.  The </p><p>U.S. has paid nothing under the agreement, (OSD/CN has stated </p><p>that the USG cannot fund radars operated by foreign </p><p>nationals) and the issue affects relations between the U.S. </p><p>and Honduran militaries.  The Embassy has sought guidance </p><p>from DOD and State on how to resolve U.S. obligations, and </p><p>recommended that the U.S. either replace the radar with a </p><p>solid state version (TPS-78) or with another TPS-70 </p><p>transferred from counterdrug programs.  When operational, the </p><p>radar  provides a view of the Honduras-Nicaragua-El Salvador </p><p>border areas and the Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific Ocean.  A </p><p>functioning radar in this location could greatly enhance </p><p>Honduran capability to intercept and track illegal flights. </p><p>The MOD and CHOD have agreed to share all data from this </p><p>radar with the US and with its neighbors.  Additionally, this </p><p>radar would be the first step in eliminating the 10 mile "no </p><p>fly" (without advance notice) corridor between the Honduran </p><p>and Nicaraguan border - currently a safe haven for illegal </p><p>flights. The AMB and country team strongly support current </p><p>efforts to have the radar in Venezuela (currently being </p><p>dismantled) be made available for EDA for Honduras in </p><p>December of this year. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>F-5\'s for MANPADS? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Honduras maintains a fleet of aging F-5\'s as part of </p><p>its overall defense structure, providing Honduras with the </p><p>most lethal air force in the region.  Honduras has been under </p><p>some regional pressure to give up or reduce its fleet of </p><p>F-5\'s as a consolation to Nicaragua who is also being </p><p>encouraged to give up, or significantly reduce, its stock of </p><p>Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS).  Honduras has </p><p>resisted these efforts, suggesting that its fleet of F-5\'s </p><p>should be de-coupled from any discussion of MANPADS, which </p><p>are a potential terrorist weapon. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Brooke Amendment - GOH Facing Possible Sanctions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Honduras faces the possibility of mandated Brooke </p><p>Sanctions in September if three DOD loans totaling USD 1.73 </p><p>million are not paid in full.  This debt is over a year old </p><p>and once Brooke Sanctions are invoked, no new or pending USG </p><p>assistance is permitted to proceed, including programs </p><p>administered by USAID, DOD, and State.  These sanctions do </p><p>not affect existing assistance efforts already obligated by </p><p>these agencies.  The GOH is fully aware of the consequences </p><p>of falling under Brooke Sanctions but is not clear at all </p><p>how, or if, the GOH will be able to repay the loans before </p><p>the September 3 deadline.  The situation is further </p><p>complicated because under the Paris Club rules, the GOH is </p><p>not allowed to pay only one official creditor. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Counternarcotics Issues </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Honduras\' geography places it squarely in the middle </p><p>of a major illegal drug transshipment zone and the Embassy </p><p>estimates that between 80-100 tons of cocaine transit the </p><p>country annually on its way to the U.S. market.  Honduras\' </p><p>airspace is regularly violated by drug traffickers, who also </p><p>use go-fast boats to transit their cocaine through the </p><p>region.  Heroin and marijuana are likewise transited through </p><p>Honduras on a lesser scale.  Recently, the Embassy has </p><p>noticed a significant increase in drugs-for-guns bartering </p><p>between Colombian traffickers and local Honduran smugglers. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Honduras has been under heightened USG pressure to </p><p>increase its effectiveness on counternarcotics issues after </p><p>disappointing results in 2001 and 2002.  This effort appears </p><p>to have born fruit.  The GOH has seized approximately 3,750 </p><p>kilos of cocaine this year (more than the previous four years </p><p>combined).  While seizure rates have expanded significantly </p><p>this year, endemic corruption in the Public Ministry and the </p><p>police continue to hamper long-term efforts to increase the </p><p>rule of law and reduce the amount of drugs transiting the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Under pressure from the USG to interdict more drugs, </p><p>in April the Honduran Air Force shot-down an intruding </p><p>Colombian aircraft carrying approximately 942 kilos of </p><p>cocaine, killing the plane\'s two Colombian crewmembers. </p><p>SOUTHCOM temporarily suspended sharing of air-track </p><p>information pending reconfirmation from the GOH that Honduras </p><p>has a "no shoot-down" policy.  The Embassy has since received </p><p>such assurances and the GOH has stated that the incident was </p><p>an aberration.  Honduras is fully aware that under U.S. law, </p><p>the USG is not allowed to share tactical air-track </p><p>information with countries that employ a shoot-down policy. </p><p>SOUTHCOM has since restored sharing air-track information </p><p>with the GOH. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Anticorruption </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) U.S. policy against corruption struck a nerve in </p><p>Honduras, especially any mention of our visa revocation </p><p>authorities.  Politicians in Congress and certain business </p><p>elements feel the U.S. is attacking them.  Maduro appears </p><p>committed to addressing corruption, even if it will cost him </p><p>political support within his party.  The Supreme Court </p><p>President is also on board.  However, individual judges </p><p>remain susceptible to offers of bribes and the Attorney </p><p>General is unwilling to prosecute high-profile cases.  Given </p><p>the scope of the problem, any public discussion about the </p><p>country\'s pervasive corruption is a positive development. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Supreme Court and Judicial Reform </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) The Supreme Court is developing into an independent </p><p>branch of power, unlike all of its predecessor courts since </p><p>democracy was restored in 1982.  It is pro-reform in </p><p>orientation and fighting for its prerogatives.  A key </p><p>emerging issue is whether it can become a fully independent </p><p>and co-equal branch of political power, consistent with the </p><p>separation of powers provision in the Honduran Constitution. </p><p>The established political order is fighting that prospect </p><p>with all its might.  In fact, the Congress seized the </p><p>political opportunity to introduce legislation that would </p><p>amend the constitution to give itself the power to interpret </p><p>the constitutionality of the laws it passes.  The Supreme </p><p>Court ruled in May that the proposed amendment was </p><p>unconstitutional, which sparked a tense confrontation between </p><p>the Supreme Court and Congress.  Congress, however, refrained </p><p>from any precipitous action and the issue has since receded. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Public Security/Human Rights </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) Upon taking office on January 27, 2002, President </p><p>Maduro\'s first act was to fulfill his main campaign promise </p><p>-- a zero tolerance campaign against the country\'s </p><p>out-of-control crime situation.  He deployed more than 5,000 </p><p>soldiers to the streets to support the police.  The public </p><p>responded enthusiastically.  However, despite the initial </p><p>success of establishing a visible police presence, violent </p><p>crime, particularly homicides, continues at a high rate. </p><p>Public support is fading and the campaign needs some visible </p><p>victories to restore confidence in the government\'s program. </p><p>The USG is helping the Maduro government establish an </p><p>anti-kidnapping unit, increase intake/training of police </p><p>recruits, create a model tourist police force, boost its </p><p>counternarcotics efforts, and expand the frontier police. </p><p>The country\'s geographic position makes it an obvious </p><p>strategic transit point for narcotics trafficking, alien </p><p>smuggling operations and other organized crime activities. </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) Extrajudicial killings, especially of </p><p>children/young adults since 1998, have been a source of </p><p>serious concern and only recently has the GOH begun to take </p><p>steps to investigate the hundreds of unsolved cases.  There </p><p>are serious problems with child labor in several industries, </p><p>particularly melon, coffee, and sugar cane (but not the </p><p>maquila) sectors, and trafficking in persons of </p><p>women/children for prostitution in the U.S. and children for </p><p>commercial sexual exploitation in Central America.  USAID and </p><p>Peace Corps have both been involved in HIV/AIDS prevention. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) At least 600,000 Hondurans, both legal and illegal, </p><p>live in the U.S., a fact that places immigration issues high </p><p>on the bilateral agenda.  (The population of Honduras is 6.5 </p><p>million.)  There is deep appreciation for the USG\'s extension </p><p>of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the U.S. and interest </p><p>in possible congressional action on the proposed Nicaraguan </p><p>Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), which </p><p>would give immigration parity for Hondurans.  With </p><p>approximately 18,000 American citizens residing in Honduras </p><p>and many thousands visiting Honduras annually for tourism and </p><p>business, American Citizen Services are a key part of the </p><p>Embassy\'s work.  Since 1995, 34 American Citizens have been </p><p>murdered in Honduras.  There has been little progress on </p><p>these cases and to date, only two convictions have been made. </p><p> However, in the last year the GOH has increased cooperation </p><p>with the Embassy on the remaining cases, including </p><p>establishing two prosecutors to further the GOH\'s effort. </p><p>Also, little progress has been made on extradition cases </p><p>involving American Citizens residing in Honduras who are </p><p>wanted for felonies in the United States. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Border Relations </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) Honduras has border disputes with its three Central </p><p>American land neighbors and its seven maritime neighbors. </p><p>Maduro is personally engaged with his Presidential </p><p>counterparts to address these issues.  Its land and maritime </p><p>disputes with El Salvador and Nicaragua are the most heated. </p><p>The Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific coast is a particularly </p><p>difficult point.  A 1992 International Court of Justice (ICJ) </p><p>ruling laid out shared areas of control in the Gulf of </p><p>Fonseca and established the land border between Honduras and </p><p>El Salvador, although El Salvador has been slow to implement </p><p>the ruling.  In September 2002, El Salvador requested a </p><p>revision of the 1992 ICJ ruling.  Honduras has responded to </p><p>this request and opposes any revisions to the original </p><p>ruling.  In the interim, the Organization of American States </p><p>(as a neutral third party) is providing both nations </p><p>technical assistance to help them implement the ICJ\'s ruling. </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU) On the Caribbean coast, Honduras and Nicaragua have </p><p>a long-standing maritime border dispute over the 15th </p><p>parallel.  In the past, the dispute has threatened to derail </p><p>trilateral counternarcotics operations.  Honduras provoked </p><p>Nicaraguan retaliation when it signed a maritime treaty with </p><p>Colombia recognizing the 15th parallel as its maritime border </p><p>in 1999.  Nicaragua filed an ICJ case over the maritime </p><p>border and more importantly in 1999 slapped a punitive 35 per </p><p>cent tariff on Honduran goods.  This tariff remained in place </p><p>until April of this year despite a Central American Court of </p><p>Justice ruling that it is illegal.  Only after Honduras </p><p>responded with a retaliatory tariff, threatening Nicaraguan </p><p>exports, did Managua back down.  Tensions still exist between </p><p>the GOH and Nicaragua, hampering regional integration and </p><p>couternarcotics efforts. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Economic Overview </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>24. (SBU) Honduras, with a per-capita income of only USD 950, </p><p>is the third poorest country in the Western Hemisphere ahead </p><p>of only Nicaragua and Haiti.  The Honduran economy is growing </p><p>slowly, with real GDP growth of only two-and-a-half percent </p><p>in 2002 and 2003.  Low world coffee prices also continue to </p><p>inhibit growth in rural areas.  Inflation, at double-digit </p><p>levels in the late 1990s, has decreased and is now relatively </p><p>stable at about 8 percent per year, while the currency is </p><p>depreciating at a rate of about 6 percent per year.  The </p><p>economy continues to be dominated primarily by agriculture, </p><p>particularly the production of coffee, bananas and cultivated </p><p>shrimp.   However, the in-bond apparel assembly industry </p><p>(maquilas) has grown dramatically over the past decade and </p><p>now employs over 100,000 people.  Remittances from Hondurans </p><p>living overseas, primarily in the United States, continue to </p><p>grow rapidly (up 15 percent in the first six months of 2003) </p><p>and have become the most important source of foreign </p><p>exchange.  The U.S. is Honduras\' largest trading partner and </p><p>the roughly 150 U.S. companies that do business in Honduras </p><p>constitute the largest block of foreign direct investors. </p><p>While many social indicators are improving, two-thirds of all </p><p>Hondurans live in poverty and average educational levels are </p><p>very low. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>Stubborn Fiscal Deficits Endanger IMF Program/Debt Relief </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) President Maduro inherited a stagnating economy and </p><p>seriously deteriorated government finances from the previous </p><p>administration.  During its first 18 months in power the </p><p>Maduro administration has passed two fiscal packages (in May </p><p>2002 and April 2003) designed to broaden the tax base, help </p><p>reduce chronic budget deficits, and move the government on </p><p>the road to an IMF agreement.  However the IMF is still </p><p>concerned about persistent fiscal deficits, and an IMF </p><p>agreement is highly unlikely until the Congress passes major </p><p>civil service reform legislation.  The Maduro Administration, </p><p>however, is hesitant to push these needed reforms because </p><p>they will fundamentally alter the salary structure of </p><p>teachers and medical workers who currently benefit from </p><p>special legislation which gives them annual salary increases </p><p>well above inflation.  Teachers particularly are a powerful </p><p>special interest group that if agitated could destabilize the </p><p>government.  Moreover, Maduro\'s lack of congressional support </p><p>for civil service reform has also hamstrung his efforts. </p><p> </p><p>26. (SBU) Multilateral and bilateral donor disbursements (USD </p><p>140 million) will be held up until a new IMF program is in </p><p>place.  There is also pressure on GOH Paris Club debt service </p><p>payments (USD 100 million per year), and the completion point </p><p>for debt reduction under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries </p><p>initiative (HIPC - worth USD 900 million) continues to slip </p><p>back further.  If unaddressed, this fiscal situation could </p><p>also impact Honduras\' eligibility for Millennium Challenge </p><p>Account grants. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>27. (SBU) President Maduro, who has identified CAFTA as his </p><p>government\'s principal trade objective, is a strong supporter </p><p>of regional economic integration.  The historically weak </p><p>Ministry of Trade and Industry got a late start in preparing </p><p>for this year\'s CAFTA negotiations, but has added staff and </p><p>been an active participant in the negotiations so far. </p><p>Latent protectionism exists in the private sector, especially </p><p>agriculture, but the general attitude toward a free trade </p><p>agreement in Honduras is guardedly positive.  The textile and </p><p>apparel industry in particular believes that some type of </p><p>free trade agreement is the only way that the Honduran </p><p>apparel sector can survive the elimination of quotas in 2005 </p><p>and compete with Asian manufacturers.  As such, it is the </p><p>strongest supporter of CAFTA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>U.S. Investment Faces Problems </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>28. (SBU) Maduro\'s Administration understands the need to </p><p>increase foreign (and domestic) investment to spur economic </p><p>growth, but so far has placed its emphasis on the more </p><p>immediate problems of political and judicial reforms, the </p><p>fiscal deficit, and needed improvements in security, </p><p>education and health.  The government identified tourism, </p><p>agribusiness, and forestry as important sectors that could </p><p>create much-needed jobs.  While some efforts to promote </p><p>tourism have paid off, little headway has been made in the </p><p>other sectors. </p><p> </p><p>29. (SBU) Much needs to be done to declare Honduras "open for </p><p>business."  Maduro needs to find a way to get his cabinet </p><p>(and the prickly legislative and judicial branches) to make </p><p>meaningful changes that will resolve key problems such as: </p><p>poor and expensive infrastructure; a weak legal system; </p><p>threats to personal security; weak education and health </p><p>conditions; land tenure problems; and opposition to large </p><p>foreign investments by well-connected vested interests. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Money Laundering and Bank Failures </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>30. (C) Strengthened money laundering legislation, with an </p><p>anti-terrorist financing clause, was passed in early 2002, </p><p>and the GOH followed up rapidly with creation of a Financial </p><p>Information Unit (FIU) for investigation of financial crimes. </p><p> Currently, over 150 potential cases of money laundering are </p><p>under investigation.  However, without greater participation </p><p>from the slow and corrupt Public Ministry, responsible for </p><p>prosecuting such cases, results will be minimal. </p><p> </p><p>31. (SBU) Weakness of the financial system remains a key </p><p>concern.  The GOH took over the two most troubled banks in </p><p>May 2002 (one has since been closed), arranged for the </p><p>absorption of a third undercapitalized bank, and is actively </p><p>promoting mergers among the remaining 20 private banks. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Embassy Tegucigalpa </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>32. (SBU) Embassy Tegucigalpa is a medium-sized post, </p><p>employing 140 U.S. citizens and 300 Hondurans among 20 USG </p><p>agencies.  Our Peace Corps program, with more than 220 </p><p>volunteers, is one of the world\'s largest, and the USAID </p><p>mission had a FY03 budget of USD 45 million.  The Mission </p><p>maintains a Consular Agent in Honduras\' second city and </p><p>industrial center, San Pedro Sula. </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
