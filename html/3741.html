<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002102 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: FUEL SHORTAGE OR PANIC BUYING? -- FUEL QUEUES </p><p>RESULT REGARDLESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 01719 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  Various sources suggest that a nation-wide fuel </p><p>shortage is likely sooner rather than later (reftel).  Even </p><p>with continued financial support from Libya regarding the </p><p>fuel itself, widely reported in recent press accounts, the </p><p>GOZ is facing huge pressures to produce forex to get the fuel </p><p>into the country through the port facilities in Beira.  The </p><p>GOZ has reportedly closed a US $360 million deal with Libya </p><p>which will supply Zimbabwe with fuel for the next year, while </p><p>increasing Libya\'s stakes in various assets within Zimbabwe. </p><p>However, fuel stations throughout the country continue to </p><p>display "No Fuel" signs, and fuel queues continue to indicate </p><p>which stations actually have petrol available. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Fuel queues have been reported on and off throughout </p><p>Zimbabwe since the end of August.  However, the queues have </p><p>now hit the country with a vengeance, as lines of motorists </p><p>throughout Harare currently spend anywhere from twenty </p><p>minutes to several hours waiting for fuel.  According to </p><p>reports from Embassy personnel who have been driving outside </p><p>of Harare over the weekend, there is no diesel available </p><p>north of Harare.   Some motorists have said that the petrol </p><p>station personnel indicate that there is plenty of fuel </p><p>available, and the state-controlled media dismisses the fuel </p><p>queues as the result of "hoarding" and "panic buying."  It is </p><p>probable that many consumers are filling their tanks now, </p><p>while fuel is available, rather than depend upon the shaky </p><p>system which may not be able to guarantee availability next </p><p>week. </p><p> </p><p>Prologue to Higher Prices? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. Other motorists, however, state that fuel station </p><p>operators report that shortages are being engineered ahead of </p><p>a fuel price increase rumored to be up to 40% higher than </p><p>current prices.  In previous situations when the GOZ wanted </p><p>to increase fuel prices, the country would experience a fuel </p><p>shortage with all the resultant uncertainties and anxieties, </p><p>after which the price would jump when fuel finally became </p><p>available.  According to one source, motorists were so </p><p>relieved to actually get petrol that the price increase had </p><p>been absorbed without much protest. </p><p> </p><p>4. There is certainly room, from a global perspective, for </p><p>the price of petroleum products to increase -- the current </p><p>price of fuel is Zim $73/liter for diesel, and Zim $76/liter </p><p>for blend gasoline (approximately US $.10 per liter/$.40 per </p><p>gallon for diesel, and approximately US $.11 per liter/$.44 </p><p>per gallon for gasoline, at the parallel rate).  There are </p><p>persistent reports of large-scale transport companies sending </p><p>their trucks across border points into Zimbabwe with their </p><p>gas gagues on "E" to fill their tanks up at the artificially </p><p>low price.  However, despite the fact that fuel and energy </p><p>are the only two sectors not benefitting from price supports, </p><p>preferential price structures, or the ability to otherwise </p><p>earn forex, the GOZ appears reluctant to allow the price of </p><p>fuel to increase.  Given the public uproar which occurred </p><p>when mass transit operators attempted to increase commuter </p><p>fares in May without the GOZ\'s approval, this reluctance may </p><p>be prudent. </p><p> </p><p>Libya Wants Hard Cash </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. As noted in previous reports (see reftel), the Libyans </p><p>have expressed an increasing reluctance to continue providing </p><p>fuel unless the GOZ pays in forex. By contrast, local media </p><p>report that the Libyans are interested in increasing their </p><p>level of ownership in strategic assets, including a stake in </p><p>the parastatal National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM) and </p><p>its storage tanks.  Regardless of their preferred currency, </p><p>Libya needs payment for oil in one fashion or another -- the </p><p>GOZ currently owes Libya approximately US $60 million for </p><p>fuel already delivered and consumed, and Libya is wary about </p><p>extending further credit.  However, even if Libya were </p><p>prepared to provide oceans of fuel at a bargain price with </p><p>payment due sometime far into the future -- and there is no </p><p>indication that it is -- the logistics of delivering the fuel </p><p>to retailers and motorists remain problematic.  One element </p><p>contributing to the sporadic availability of fuel is the </p><p>GOZ\'s inability to meet costs for docking space, port </p><p>charges, facility fees, and pumping costs, which must be paid </p><p>in forex.  There are also reports that the storage facilities </p><p>within Zimbabwe are, on orders from the Libyan fuel owners, </p><p>only releasing fuel on a daily basis dependent upon the </p><p>amount of forex which NOCZIM can pay. </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. The fuel situation continues to deteriorate, and </p><p>uncertainty about the future is undoubtedly exacerbating the </p><p>shortages.  There are conflicting reports about Libya\'s </p><p>intentions -- in some quarters, Libya is cast as the party </p><p>restricting the flow of fuel into the country, while in </p><p>others Libya is portrayed as wanting increased (and </p><p>presumably more choice) access to Zimbabwean assets. In </p><p>either case, Libya\'s influence on the GOZ will remain </p><p>significant for the foreseeable future.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
