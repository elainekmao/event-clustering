<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000594 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARDS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Over the 3/22-23 weekend, Zimbabwean newspapers </p><p>      dedicated major acreage to comment on the war to </p><p>      disarm Iraq.  The tone is critical.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "U. N. in tatters" the pro- </p><p>      government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" (03/23) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The decision by the United States and its </p><p>      allies to launch a military attack on Iraq </p><p>      without the endorsement of the United Nations </p><p>      has seriously undermined the world </p><p>      organization\'s integrity. . .  Prominent global </p><p>      leaders have argued the case for a peaceful </p><p>      resolution of the Iraq question within the U.N. </p><p>      framework but, unfortunately, U.S. President </p><p>      George W. Bush and his British and Spanish </p><p>      allies have stubbornly refused to budge, </p><p>      choosing instead to plunge the world body into a </p><p>      potentially fatal credibility crisis.  The </p><p>      ongoing attacks on Iraq are in open defiance if </p><p>      the U.N. Charter and customary international law </p><p>      and, therefore, constitute unlawful acts of </p><p>      aggression. . .  The unilateral decision to </p><p>      strike Iraq by the U.S. has introduced a </p><p>      dangerous precedent in the conduct of </p><p>      international relations. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Most unpopular war" the </p><p>      independent daily "The Daily News" (02/22) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The United States\' war against Iraq. . .is </p><p>      probably the most unpopular war a U.S. President </p><p>      has ever initiated. . .  The U.N. will be </p><p>      criticized for a long time for not coming up </p><p>      with a forthright condemnation of the U.S. and </p><p>      Britain for playing the Lone Ranger and Tonto. </p><p>      The hope around the world is that there will be </p><p>      few civilian casualties and minimum destruction </p><p>      of Iraq, already reeling from U.N. sanctions </p><p>      imposed after the Gulf War of the 1990s.  Saddam </p><p>      Hussein may be a warmonger and a dictator, but </p><p>      dialogue ought to have been given a chance. </p><p>      There was no cause for the U.S. to decide on war </p><p>      regardless of the potential for inciting </p><p>      reprisals against its allies and another 11 </p><p>      September outrage on its own.  All that will be </p><p>      on George W. Bush\'s head." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
