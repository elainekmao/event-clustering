<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GABORONE 001886 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR PM/DAS COOK FROM AMBASSADOR </p><p>ALSO FOR AF, AF/RA AND AF/S - JACKSON </p><p>LONDON FOR YOUNG </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, SADC, BC </p><p>SUBJECT:  SADC CONFLICT RESOLUTION CONFERENCE: AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>MEETING WITH BDF COMMANDER KHAMA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 73668 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AS REQUESTED REFTEL, AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY DCM AND ODC </p><p>CHIEF, MET WITH BDF COMMANDER IAN KHAMA MARCH 29 FOR A READOUT </p><p>ON THE GABORONE CONFERENCE OF SADC MEMBER STATE ARMY CHIEFS OF </p><p>STAFF.  KHAMA SAID ONLY ANGOLA, MOZAMBIQUE AND LESOTHO WERE </p><p>UNREPRESENTED AT THE MEETING, WHICH FOCUSSED ON CONFLICT </p><p>PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT.  SOUTH AFRICA, AN ACTIVE </p><p>PARTICIPANT, WAS REPRESENTED BY SANDF ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF </p><p>MEIRING.  ACCORDING TO KHAMA, THE FOLLOWING FOUR SUBJECTS WERE </p><p>ADDRESSED: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE TYPE OF STRUCTURE BEST SUITED TO TRY TO PREVENT </p><p>CONFLICTS AND TO MANAGE THEM IF THEY DO BREAK OUT; </p><p> </p><p>-- THE CAUSES AND PREVENTION OF COUPS; </p><p> </p><p>-- DISCUSSION OF THE HARARE PEACEKEEPING SUMMIT TO EXPLORE THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF REGIONAL OR CONTINENT-WIDE APPROACHES TO </p><p>PEACEKEEPING; </p><p> </p><p>--THE EFFECT OF REFUGEES ON STABILITY AND HOW TO REDUCE THEIR </p><p>NEGATIVE IMPACT. </p><p> </p><p>STRUCTURE/ AREAS OF INTER-STATE COOPERATION </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED AREAS IN WHICH THEY SHOULD ENGAGE </p><p>IN REGULAR COOPERATION.  KHAMA CITED THE FOLLOWING AS DIRECTLY </p><p>RELATED TO CONFLICT PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT:  OPERATIONS, </p><p>INTELLIGENCE FOR EARLY WARNING, LOGISTICS, AVIATION, MARITIME </p><p>ASSETS.  MEDICINE (E.G. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION ON REGIONAL </p><p>OUTBREAKS OF DISEASE, AIDS) AND OTHER UNSPECIFIED AREAS WERE </p><p>IDENTIFIED FOR COOPERATION EVEN OUTSIDE THE CONFLICT RESOLUTION </p><p>CONTEXT.  THESE PROPOSED AREAS OF COOPERATION WERE ALLOCATED TO </p><p>MEMBER STATES REPRESENTED.  EACH WILL ORGANIZE A MEETING TO </p><p>FURTHER EXPLORE EACH RESPECTIVE TOPIC AND PREPARE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MINISTERIAL APPROVAL AT A JUNE DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTERS MEETING IN SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>PREVENTION OF COUPS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  KHAMA SAID MANY, INCLUDING HIMSELF, "POINTED FINGERS AT THE </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERSHIP" ON THIS ISSUE.  THEY FELT THAT POOR </p><p>MANAGEMENT BY THE POLITICAL LEVEL, RESULTING IN ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS, CONTRIBUTED TO CREATING FERTILE GROUND FOR COUPS. </p><p>KHAMA CITED UNBALANCED DEVELOPMENT, CORRUPTION, AND FAVORITISM </p><p>ALONG TRIBAL LINES, INCLUDING IN THE ARMED FORCES, AS </p><p>CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PROBLEM.  POOR TREATMENT OF THE MILITARY </p><p>POSES ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS, KHAMA SAID, CITING THE FACT THAT </p><p>JUNIOR RANKS, NOT JUST COMMANDERS ARE NOW ENGAGING IN COUPS. </p><p>THE ARMY COMMANDERS CONCLUDED THAT THE AVOIDANCE OF COUPS COULD </p><p>ONLY BE ADDRESSED BY POLITICAL LEADERS, NOT MILITARY MEN. </p><p> </p><p>REFUGEES AND STABILITY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THIS FOURTH POINT CENTERED ON THE IMPACT OF REFUGEES ON </p><p>STABILITY AND MEANS TO REDUCE THEIR NEGATIVE IMPACT.  AS WITH </p><p>THE AGENDA ITEM ON COUPS, KHAMA SAID THE MEETING CONCLUDED THE </p><p>IMPACT AND MANAGEMENT OF REFUGEES WAS A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, NOT THE ARMED FORCES.  THE DISRUPTION </p><p>CAUSED BY REFUGEE FLOWS, AND THE PERCEPTION IN SOME COUNTRIES </p><p>THAT BECAUSE OF INTERNATIONAL RELIEF EFFORTS, REFUGEES ACHIEVE </p><p>A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING THAN LOCAL CITIZENS, CAUSED REAL </p><p>PROBLEMS.  HE CITED TANZANIA AS A COUNTRY PARTICULARLY HARD HIT </p><p>BY THIS PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>HARARE PEACEKEEPING SUMMIT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  KHAMA TOLD AMBASSADOR THE GABORONE MEETING ACHIEVED THE </p><p>LEAST ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC.  THERE WAS MUCH DISCUSSION, HE </p><p>SAID, OF REGIONAL LOGISTICAL AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, BUT NO </p><p>ANSWERS TO SUCH QUESTIONS AS : "WHO WILL EQUIP AND FUND </p><p>PEACEKEEPERS?" AND "WHO WILL BE GIVEN ACCESS TO STORES OF </p><p>EQUIPMENT FOR PEACEKEEPING, AND WHEN?" </p><p> </p><p>7.  AT THE MEETING, KHAMA REMINDED HIS COUNTERPARTS THAT IN THE </p><p>LESOTHO CRISIS ONLY SOUTH AFRICA AND BOTSWANA HAD BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>MOBILIZE AND TRANSPORT THEIR FORCES.  ZIMBABWE AND NAMIBIA, BY </p><p>CONTRAST, REQUIRED TRANSPORTATION FOR THEIR TROOPS AND </p><p>MATERIEL.  THE BDF COMMANDER STRESSED TO THE AMBASSADOR HIS </p><p>CONVICTION -- WHICH HE ALSO CONVEYED TO THE GABORONE MEETING -- </p><p>THAT "ALL NATIONS MUST HAVE A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT ANY TROOPS </p><p>THEY SEND.  THEY MUST NOT ASK JUST ONE COUNTRY (I.E. SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA) FOR HELP."  ANY PEACEKEEPING ENGAGED IN BY REGIONAL </p><p>FORCES, HE UNDERLINED, WOULD HAVE TO BE ENDORSED IF NOT </p><p>REQUESTED BY THE UN AND/OR OAU.  THIS ENDORSEMENT WOULD OPEN </p><p>THE WAY TO REQUESTS FOR DONOR SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN SOUTH AFRICA IN JUNE DEFENSE MINISTERS WILL MEET TO TRY </p><p>TO COME UP WITH A FORMULA FOR FIRST USING MEMBER STATES\' OWN </p><p>RESOURCES  FOR PEACEKEEPING, THEN TURNING TO THE UN FOR </p><p>SUPPORT.  KHAMA STRESSED HIS VIEW THAT INITIATING REGIONAL </p><p>PEACEKEEPING SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON RECEIVING DONOR SUPPORT </p><p>FROM THE OUTSET.  INSTEAD, HE SAID, THERE MUST BE NATIONAL </p><p>POLITICAL COMMITMENT IN EACH COUNTRY.  EACH COUNTRY\'S ARMED </p><p>FORCES SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO COMMIT NATIONAL RESOURCES TO </p><p>PEACEKEEPING IN ADVANCE OF REQUESTING INTERNATIONAL DONOR HELP. </p><p>THIS, KHAMA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR, IS WHAT HE INTENDS TO "WHISPER </p><p>IN (HIS) MINISTER\'S EAR" AT THE MEETING IN SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>THUMBS DOWN ON STANDING FORCE BUT SUPPORT FOR EARMARKING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED FOR KHAMA\'S VIEWS ON THE STANDING </p><p>FORCE CONCEPT.  KHAMA SAID HE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF </p><p>A "COMBINED STANDING FORCE," PRIMARILY FOR TWO REASONS.  FIRST, </p><p>BECAUSE TO BE EFFECTIVE IT WOULD HAVE TO TRAIN TOGETHER -- </p><p>SOMETHING MOST COUNTRIES IN THE REGION CANNOT AFFORD.  SECOND </p><p>BECAUSE, IN KHAMA\'S VIEW, PARTICIPATION IN A COMBINED STANDING </p><p>FORCE WOULD AMOUNT TO BOTSWANA SIGNING AWAY ITS SOVEREIGN RIGHT </p><p>TO DECIDE, ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, WHEN AND WHERE TO SEND ITS </p><p>TROOPS.  BY CONTRAST, KHAMA FAVORED CREATION OF A FORCE BASED </p><p>ON EARMARKING SPECIFIC CONTINGENTS IN EACH PARTICIPATING </p><p>MILITARY AND PREPARING THEM TO BE MOBILIZABLE WITHIN 48 HOURS. </p><p>ODC CHIEF NOTED THAT EVEN UNDER NATO\'S INTEGRATED MILITARY </p><p>COMMAND EACH NATION RETAINS THE SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO DETERMINE </p><p>WHETHER OR NOT TO RELEASE ITS EARMARKED FORCES TO NATO COMMAND. </p><p> </p><p>LOTS OF QUESTIONS; NO DECISIONS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  KHAMA REITERATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE MEETING DID NOT/NOT </p><p>AGREE ON ANY STANDBY FORCE OPTION.  MANY QUESTIONS REMAINED, </p><p>INCLUDING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SIZE OF SUCH A FORCE, </p><p>COORDINATION MECHANISMS BETWEEN A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION AND THE </p><p>UN, AND WHETHER A REQUEST TO BECOME INVOLVED IN A CONFLICT </p><p>SITUATION WOULD BE INITIATED BY THE UN OR BY THE REGIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  THERE WAS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER, THAT A COUNTRY </p><p>ASKED BY THE UN TO DEPLOY FORCES SHOULD IN TURN SEEK UN </p><p>SUPPORT.  RESPONDING TO A QUESTION FROM THE ODC CHIEF KHAMA </p><p>SAID DEPLOYABILITY HAD NOT BEEN DISCUSSED.  HE EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE DISCUSSION CENTERED ON A FORCE </p><p>PERTAINING ONLY TO THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN (SADC) REGION, NOT </p><p>BEYOND (E.G. TO BURUNDI). </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THE U.S. HAS NO FIXED FORMULA </p><p>IN MIND BUT IS EAGER TO RECEIVE AND EXAMINE OTHERS\' VIEWS ON </p><p>REGIONAL PEACEKEEPING, PARTICULARLY IN PREPARATION FOR THE MAY </p><p>MEETING AT THE NATIONAL WAR COLLEGE.  KHAMA REITERATED HIS </p><p>LONG-STANDING CONCERN THAT ANY PEACEKEEPING ARRANGMENT FULLY </p><p>RESPECT AND PRESERVE A COUNTRY\'S SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO DECIDE, ON </p><p>A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, WHETHER, WHERE, AND WHEN TO DEPLOY ITS </p><p>TROOPS.  HE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT PROPOSALS SUCH AS A </p><p>CANADIAN ONE (UNFAMILIAR TO US) TO CREATE A STANDING RAPID </p><p>DEPLOYMENT FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>THE FLS/ASAS/SADC CONNECTION </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  AMBASSADOR CLOSED BY ASKING HOW THE INTERSTATE COMMITTEE </p><p>ON DEFENSE AND SECURITY FITS WITH SADC.  IN RESPONSE, KHAMA </p><p>RECALLED THAT LAST YEAR IN ARUSHA COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAD DECIDED </p><p>THEY DID NOT WANT TO BECOME PART OF SADC.  WHILE THE TRANSITION </p><p>FROM OLD TO NEW ORGANIZATIONS IS CURRENTLY A BIT CONFUSED, </p><p>KHAMA SAID THAT IN THE END, THE FRONTLINE STATES (FLS) WILL BE </p><p>TRANSFORMED INTO THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STATES </p><p>(ASAS) AND "WE (I.E. THE COMMITTEE) SEE OURSELVES LINKED WITH </p><p>ASAS."  IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION, KHAMA WENT ON TO </p><p>SAY HE EXPECTED NO COORDINATION PROBLEMS BETWEEN ASAS AND SADC </p><p>SINCE THE SAME COUNTRIES ARE MEMBERS OF BOTH GROUPS AND </p><p>POLITICAL DECISIONS ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND PEACEKEEPING ARE </p><p>MADE BY THE SAME LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  THREE THINGS STRUCK US ABOUT THE KHAMA BRIEFING:  ONE IS </p><p>THE DETERMINATION AND SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH KHAMA AND HIS ARMY </p><p>COMMANDER COLLEAGUES ARE APPROACHING THESE ISSUES; TWO IS THE </p><p>ACTIVE AND SUPPORTIVE ROLE THAT SOUTH AFRICA IS NOW PLAYING IN </p><p>THESE DISCUSSIONS; AND THREE IS THE DIFFICULTY OF COMING TO </p><p>GRIPS WITH THE ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF FUTURE CONFLICT </p><p>RESOLUTION/MANAGEMENT AND PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  WHILE WE ARE UNSURE OF THE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE MAY </p><p>NATIONAL WAR COLLEGE MEETING, IT SEEMS, FROM WHERE WE SIT, THAT </p><p>WE COULD MAKE A LARGE CONTRIBUTION BY HELPING COUNTRIES IN THIS </p><p>REGION TO WORK OUT THE CONCEPTUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL BASIS ON </p><p>WHICH FUTURE CONFLICT MANAGEMENT/PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS MAY </p><p>REST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
