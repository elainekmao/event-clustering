WRIGHT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, TU, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT </p><p>TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THIS REPORT WILL PRESENT A TURKISH PRESS SUMMARY UNDER THREE </p><p>THEMES: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p>                         ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MASS APPEAL </p><p>Turkey, U.S. agreement on Mosul, Kirkuk - Hurriyet </p><p>Critical day: Powell to disclose evidence against Iraq - </p><p>Turkiye </p><p>120,000 Turkish troops to Northern Iraq to halt refugees - </p><p>Sabah </p><p>U.S. troops to Iraq via Iskenderun - Aksam </p><p>Peace hopes diminishing - Vatan </p><p>Baykal warns Gul: Kurdish state must be prevented - Milliyet </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OPINION MAKERS </p><p>Nuclear threat to Baghdad - Radikal </p><p>Government to handle war authorization after Sacrifice </p><p>Holiday - Zaman </p><p>Oil prices will soar if U.S. attacks - Yeni Safak </p><p>In war, U.S. will save oil wells first - Cumhuriyet </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FINANCIAL JOURNALS </p><p>Central Bank: Turkey needs 2.5 year for full stability - </p><p>Dunya </p><p>Inflation on the rise - Finansal Forum </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Prime Minister Gul reportedly told opposition party </p><p>CHP leader Baykal on Monday that the government would allow </p><p>350 warplanes and 40,000 U.S. troops on Turkish territory. </p><p>Gul said the issue would be discussed in the parliament </p><p>right after the U.S. presents evidence against Iraq to the </p><p>UNSC on February 5.  Gul emphasized that U.S. offers for </p><p>reparation of Turkey\'s losses were `satisfactory,\' according </p><p>to the reports.  Many AKP deputies are against a war, and </p><p>the government is exerting an effort to convince them to </p><p>approve the presence of foreign troops in Turkey.  "Aksam" </p><p>says that Gul has assured Baykal that U.S. troops will only </p><p>be given transit passage to Northern Iraq via Turkey\'s </p><p>Iskenderun harbor.  "Sabah" reports that Turkey will send to </p><p>Northern Iraq about 120,000 troops as a `preventive </p><p>measure.\'  "Hurriyet" reports that Turkey, the U.S., and the </p><p>Northern Iraqi Kurdish groups have worked out an </p><p>understanding regarding Mosul and Kirkuk.  According to the </p><p>report, Turkish and Kurdish troops will not enter Mosul and </p><p>Kirkuk, the security in that area will be guaranteed by the </p><p>U.S., and Turkey will have the right to intervene if the </p><p>Kurds attempt to occupy the area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Milliyet" on the new U.S. envoy to Turkey: "Milliyet" </p><p>evaluates a recent NYT story that U.S. Ambassador to Ankara, </p><p>Robert Pearson, will be replaced by Vice President Cheney\'s </p><p>advisor Eric Edelman.  The paper criticizes Ambassador </p><p>Pearson for denying a Milliyet report accusing the U.S. of </p><p>carrying out secret meetings with PKK leaders in Northern </p><p>Iraq.  The paper denounces former and current U.S. envoys </p><p>for launching covert threats to Turkey, and expects the new </p><p>ambassador to establish good ties with the Turkish </p><p>government on the basis of mutual interest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Papers carry UK Cyprus envoy Sir Michael Hannay\'s </p><p>warning that a failure to compromise on Cyprus will have a </p><p>negative impact on Turkey\'s EU drive.  Following his </p><p>meetings at the MFA on Monday, Sir Hannay pointed to the </p><p>limited time for substantive changes to the Annan plan, and </p><p>added that he has seen signs of compromise on the Greek </p><p>Cypriot side.  Hannay noted that once the Greek Cypriots </p><p>gain full EU membership, it will be more difficult to reach </p><p>an agreement that is acceptable to the Turkish side.  He </p><p>complained about Denktas\' efforts to block the discussion of </p><p>land issues.  Sir Hannay believes the issue of Turkish </p><p>troops on the island should be discussed with the Turkish </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economy: The wholesale price inflation figure for January </p><p>was 5.6 percent, and consumer price inflation was 2.6 </p><p>percent, marking unexpected increases in the annual </p><p>inflation rates to 32.6 percent and 26.4 percent </p><p>respectively.  Reports claim that the increase in inflation </p><p>for the first time in 12 months has been caused by the </p><p>government\'s indecisiveness and excessive spending.  Dailies </p><p>call attention to the 40,000 workers who have lost their </p><p>jobs in the banking sector.  15,000 of the workers have </p><p>applied for just 10 new vacancies at Garanti Bank. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Turkish Aerospace Industry (TAI) will </p><p>complete production of 30 Cougar AS-532 helicopters in </p><p>February, according to press reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"For the sake of a lame-duck dictator" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief Ertugrul Ozkok opined in mass appeal </p><p>Hurriyet (2/4): "Saddam Hussein is a `de facto\' lame duck </p><p>even as we speak.  It will be a miracle if Iraq shows </p><p>bravery in the war.  Turkey should make its plans based on </p><p>real politics and stay away from conventional or old- </p><p>fashioned stances.  Turkey is a genuine force in this region </p><p>and has to have a say in its reshaping.  Any policy that </p><p>might dilute Turkey\'s role and influence in the reshaping </p><p>process will be costly for Turkey. . Let\'s all brain-storm a </p><p>little: What would Turkey actually prefer in northern Iraq? </p><p>Turkish soldiers meeting US forces in northern Iraq, or </p><p>Turkish soldiers meeting Saddam\'s forces there?  In which </p><p>option will Turkey face a lesser possibility of refugees? </p><p>You don\'t have to be a military strategist to provide </p><p>answers to these questions.   Turkey should not be engaged </p><p>in a war, but should allow American troops and equipment to </p><p>pass through the country.  Turkish policy cannot be </p><p>formulated based on the interests of a lame-duck dictator." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The calendar " </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (4/4): "The </p><p>upcoming war is becoming more apparent every day.  It is </p><p>inevitable as well as imminent.  . The northern front seems </p><p>to be the best option, and it is also the US\'s preference. </p><p>Yet the US is determined to open a northern front in any </p><p>case with or without the help of Turkey.  In the absence of </p><p>Turkey\'s permission, US and UK troops will go ahead through </p><p>alternate channels to provide a dual front: one from the </p><p>north and one from the south.  . Ankara tries to adjust the </p><p>`war calendar\' based on its own interests, yet the fact of </p><p>the matter is that there is very little we can do about it. </p><p>Turkey is trapped between anti-war public opinion and </p><p>problems related with war, and the reality of the war, which </p><p>is imminent.  . At the current stage, the argument that we </p><p>should stay completely out of it is neither realistic nor </p><p>pragmatic.  The government will have to seek the </p><p>parliament\'s approval for the modernization of bases, the </p><p>transit movement of US troops, and the movement of Turkish </p><p>troops to northern Iraq.  It is only a matter of timing, and </p><p>we better be catching up with the real calendar - that is, </p><p>the deadline, which is February 14." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
