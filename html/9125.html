<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 001150 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO PROPOSES REFORMS TO </p><p>THE FEDERAL SYSTEM </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASON: 1.5 (B) </p><p>and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: President Obasanjo appears committed to using </p><p>the first months of his new Administration to introduce key </p><p>political and economic reforms.  On June 18, Obasanjo </p><p>proposed significant changes to the federal government system </p><p>and the conduct of elections.  The two most salient are: (1) </p><p>the creation of new Zonal Councils, comprised of the </p><p>pertinent state governors for each of the country,s six </p><p>geopolitical zones and, (2) a possible change eliminating </p><p>popular elections for local government councils.  A third, </p><p>potentially nettlesome proposal was the recommendation to </p><p>change elections from a contest between candidates to a </p><p>competition solely between political parties -- the winning </p><p>party could then choose the office holder after the election. </p><p> The three proposals, particularly the termination of local </p><p>elections, would require constitutional amendments.  The poor </p><p>performance of the generally wastrel local governments made </p><p>them easy prey; many people will applaud that proposal. </p><p>However, opposition parties and numerous civil rights </p><p>activists view the proposals as intended to ensure the </p><p>continued dominance of the PDP, Obasanjo,s governing party. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO: TAKING HIS MANDATE SERIOUSLY </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) We have previously reported that President Obasanjo </p><p>won the April 19 election, albeit by materially less than the </p><p>62 percent indicated in the official results.  The </p><p>irregularities surrounding the April elections (legislative, </p><p>gubernatorial, and presidential), diminished the opposition </p><p>parties, fanning embers of political tension in many areas of </p><p>the country.  There was talk of mass action; there was fear </p><p>of worse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) However, mass action has failed to materialize thus </p><p>far.  Obasanjo and his team actively reached out to </p><p>traditional leaders and members of opposition parties </p><p>susceptible to influence in a successful attempt to co-opt </p><p>them.  Time passed.  The stridency of many opportunists began </p><p>to wane.  Many left the opposition parapets, resigning </p><p>themselves to live with the reality of a massive PDP victory </p><p>at all levels.  Others, tempted by the allure of office, have </p><p>crossed the carpet to the PDP.  Probably gauging that he had </p><p>withstood the initial and perhaps strongest wave of </p><p>opposition criticism, Obasanjo decided it was time to act </p><p>decisively, in accordance with the clear mandate he believes </p><p>he won.  He also had learned a lesson from his first </p><p>Administration.  In 1999, Obasanjo got out of the starting </p><p>blocks quickly, only to allow himself to get bogged down </p><p>later in internecine party squabbles.  With good reason, </p><p>Obasanjo likely reasoned the election has made him the most </p><p>dominant figure on the political landscape; thus he might as </p><p>well act like it, flexing his political muscle when required </p><p>and bringing about sweeping reforms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) At the June 18 National Council of State meeting, </p><p>Obasanjo unveiled several bold strokes.  (The Council of </p><p>State is composed of the 36 State Governors and all former </p><p>Heads of State.  During most of his first term, Council </p><p>meetings were largely pro forma; little of significance </p><p>emerged from these sessions.  However, this initial meeting </p><p>of his second term proved differently.)  Obasanjo unveiled </p><p>proposals amending the extant federal structure and possibly </p><p>changing the process of elections in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT ) A CHANGE IS NEEDED </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The ineffectiveness of local government attracted most </p><p>of Obasanjo,s attention and ire at the Council of State </p><p>meeting.  Established to promote grassroots democracy and </p><p>development, most local governments performed abysmally, </p><p>Obasanjo groused.  Local Councils have become factories of </p><p>corruption, profligacy and often violent political </p><p>competition.  Due to this dismal showing, Obasanjo and the </p><p>Governors agreed to suspend local government elections slated </p><p>for June 21.  Thus, caretaker committees, formed by the </p><p>Governors after the expiry of the elected local officials, </p><p>tenure last year, will continue for at least another three </p><p>months.  First-term governors will likely appoint a new batch </p><p>of local caretakers, loyal and politically supportive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) During this ninety-day period, a technical review </p><p>committee will consider proposals regarding local </p><p>governments, including their possible elimination.  Another </p><p>proposal tabled at the June 18 meeting was to end local </p><p>government elections altogether, authorize governors to </p><p>nominate Local Government Councils.  A corollary proposal </p><p>would give state governors more control over money for the </p><p>local governments.  (COMMENT: The suspension of the June 21 </p><p>local elections had been a foregone conclusion.  State </p><p>Electoral Commissions were unfunded and unprepared to conduct </p><p>elections.  Most governors did not want to spend resources on </p><p>local government elections.  They also were comfortable with </p><p>allowing their hand-picked appointees to remain in control at </p><p>the local level.  All in all, the governors saw the proposals </p><p>on Local Councils as in their interests.  The proposals would </p><p>significantly increase the governors, influence at the local </p><p>level, giving them wide discretion over selection of local </p><p>officials and the expenditure of funds.  This would enhance </p><p>governors, ability to influence what happens in their states </p><p>from now and up to the 2007 elections. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>GOVERNORS ZONAL COUNCILS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Creation of Zonal Councils representing the six </p><p>geo-political zones (Southwest, South-South, Southeast, </p><p>Northwest, North-Central, Northwest) was another important </p><p>proposal.  The governors of each state in a particular zone </p><p>would comprise one council; chairmanship of the Council would </p><p>rotate among the governors on a yearly basis.  The exact </p><p>powers of the Council would have to be defined; apparently, </p><p>the Council would derive most of its powers from those </p><p>heretofore within the province of the states but take some </p><p>arrows from the federal government,s quiver as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>I DIDN,T VOTE FOR THAT CANDIDATE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) From the standpoint of democratic expression, the most </p><p>worrisome proposal dealt with the conduct of the election. </p><p>Ostensibly to curtail electoral corruption by insulating </p><p>individual candidates from having to forage for campaign </p><p>funds, a recommendation was put forward to eliminate </p><p>individual candidates in future elections.  Instead of the </p><p>electorate choosing between contesting candidates from </p><p>different parties, only the parties would contest.  The </p><p>winning party could then wait until after the election to </p><p>name the individual office holder. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The election in Anambra State presaged this </p><p>recommendation.  After the Electoral Commission announced a </p><p>slate of PDP winners for the National Assembly, the PDP </p><p>national office substituted an entirely new list of </p><p>candidates.  One of the justifications for the switch was </p><p>that the populace voted for the party, not individual </p><p>candidates.  Thus, the party had the right of candidate </p><p>substitution even after the election.  Sadly, the Electoral </p><p>Commission acquiesced in this.  In this instance, corruption </p><p>and image problems were not the reasons for the switch. </p><p>Political competition within the PDP was responsible.  The </p><p>original slate of candidates was aligned with Vice-President </p><p>Atiku; the influential Uba brothers of Anambra (Andy Uba is </p><p>one of President Obasanjo,s closest Special Assistants and </p><p>is married to one of the First Lady,s relatives) sponsored </p><p>the second group of PDP candidates.  The Anambra episode </p><p>merely provides an inkling of how this proposal could be </p><p>abused. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>NATIONAL CONFERENCE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The proposed changes would require amendments to the </p><p>Constitution.  The Presidency recently has been signaling a </p><p>newfound interest in a National Conference to discuss these </p><p>and perhaps other issues.  This represents an about-face by </p><p>Obasanjo.  Obasanjo previously opposed the idea of a National </p><p>Conference, apprehensive that it would acquire an unstoppable </p><p>momentum and would treat issues like confederation or </p><p>succession.  The current proposal would entail a 150-member </p><p>Conference, most of whom presumably would be selected by the </p><p>Presidency.  While appearing to extend a hand to advocates of </p><p>a National Conference, this approach, by letting Obasanjo </p><p>choose the delegation, would allow him to influence the </p><p>Conference and its outcomes.  (COMMENT: The idea for a </p><p>national conference had been promoted by many Southern </p><p>politicians, particularly the Yoruba political elite. </p><p>Apparently, Obasanjo promised to support the notion of a </p><p>conference in exchange for the support of Afenifere, the </p><p>pre-eminent Yoruba socio-political organization.  Now </p><p>Obasanjo appears to be following through on his promise, but </p><p>according to his own terms which might not be Afenifere,s. </p><p>END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THE OPPOSITION CRIES TRICKERY </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The opposition had little nice to say about the </p><p>Council of State proposals.  Almost all opposition political </p><p>parties issued critical statements.  Most criticism centered </p><p>around the decision to suspend the June 21 local government </p><p>elections and perhaps do away with local elections entirely. </p><p>Opposition figures called it an open assault against the </p><p>Constitution.  The more virulent oppositionists tagged it as </p><p>the first link of a long concatenation, ultimately leading to </p><p>a constitutional amendment that would allow the President and </p><p>governors to seek third terms.  With the PDP holding </p><p>super-majorities in the National Assembly and controlling </p><p>more than two-thirds of the 36 states (the PDP has 28 </p><p>governors), amending the national Constitution has been </p><p>reduced from a solemn undertaking to mostly an intra-party </p><p>affair, these critics complain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Politicians from the traditional core of Northern </p><p>politics, the Kaduna-Kano-Sokoto triangle, see the Zonal </p><p>Council and National Conference as inimical.  First, </p><p>institutionalization of the Zonal Councils would further </p><p>split the North.  The proposal would lend further relevance </p><p>to the independence of the Northeast and North Central.  This </p><p>greater identity could only be bought at the expense of the </p><p>Northwest,s influence over these other regions.  Second, </p><p>most Northerners inherently shy away from the idea of a </p><p>National Conference.  The resource poor North is afraid that </p><p>Southerners will focus on the issue of greater local autonomy </p><p>and control of local resources.  Consequently, Northerners </p><p>are wary that Obasanjo will use the specter of a National </p><p>Conference as leverage to get them to acquiesce in his </p><p>proposals if he would suspend the idea of a conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Rolling out these proposals was perhaps a canny move </p><p>by Obasanjo.  He signaled that squabbling over the elections </p><p>was a thing of the past for him; he was now focussing on </p><p>governance.  By publicizing these proposals, he also hoped to </p><p>shift the political debate.  Now his critics have to expend </p><p>some of their sparse political capital responding to these </p><p>proposals.  The more he makes them respond to what he is </p><p>doing on policy, the less time they have to lambast the </p><p>elections.  Moreover, constant, unrelenting complaining will </p><p>undermine their credibility, making them look shrill in the </p><p>public eye. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) However, Obasanjo,s move may have risks.  Given </p><p>their poor performance, local government councils have few </p><p>defenders.  However, that may not be sufficient rationale to </p><p>scrap local elections.  After all, neither the federal </p><p>government nor state governments performed admirably or even </p><p>up to expectations.  Local government, like the other tiers </p><p>of government, must improve.  However, reposing more power in </p><p>state governors or doing away with elections does not seem </p><p>like the answer.  The cure, greater consolidation of power in </p><p>the gubernatorial mansions and in the Presidential Villa, </p><p>seems more harmful to long-term democracy than the alleged </p><p>disease. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Additionally, tampering with the constitution can be </p><p>a tempting political morsel.  Allegations that President </p><p>Obasanjo is fishing to perpetuate his Presidency beyond a </p><p>second term are heretofore unsubstantiated and highly </p><p>questionable.  However, the danger exists that office holders </p><p>might seek to enact amendments as well as laws stacking the </p><p>electoral deck in their favor for the future.  It was telling </p><p>that Obasanjo did not consult widely in drafting his </p><p>proposals.  His behavior suggests a politician who believes </p><p>he is popular and that his opposition is powerless.  The </p><p>latter belief is much more accurate than the former.  While </p><p>he may have accurately measured his foes, weaknesses, </p><p>Obasanjo should be careful about taking too many political </p><p>risks, too soon.  Right now the opposition is off balance and </p><p>he is taking advantage of its weakness.  Yet self-delusion </p><p>about the size and strength of his mandate can lead to </p><p>political mistakes.  While he may believe he has vast support </p><p>and can do as he pleases, Obasanjo,s weak popularity among </p><p>many average Nigerians could still be a rallying point for </p><p>the opposition if he is seen as making too many bad moves, </p><p>too quickly. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
