<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001969 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10/16/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, CE, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT:  GSL generally receptive to concerns raised by </p><p>visiting DRL P/DAS Parmly re upcoming UNHRC session </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  During an October 10 visit to Sri </p><p>Lanka, DRL P/DAS Michael Parmly raised USG concerns </p><p>regarding the upcoming session of the United Nations </p><p>Human Rights Commission with Foreign Secretary Nihal </p><p>Rodrigo.  Rodrigo was generally receptive to the points </p><p>raised.  In a meeting with Attorney General K.C. </p><p>Kamalasabayson, Parmly expressed his admiration for the </p><p>steps the GSL has taken in the last year to improve its </p><p>human rights record.  Queried by P/DAS Parmly, </p><p>Kamalasabayson reviewed his office\'s efforts to counter </p><p>the appearance of impunity by prosecuting GSL officials </p><p>for alleged human rights violations.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>UNHRC: Libya as chair </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During an October 10 visit to Sri Lanka, DRL </p><p>P/DAS Michael Parmly met with Foreign Secretary Nihal </p><p>Rodrigo and discussed the USG\'s concerns over Libya </p><p>becoming the next chair of the UN Human rights </p><p>Commission (UNHRC) and the expected resolutions on Cuba. </p><p>Parmly stated that the USG was enthused about working </p><p>with the UNHRC again, but that the enthusiasm was </p><p>quickly dampened due to the likelihood of Libya chairing </p><p>the commission.  Having Libya chair the UNHRC, Parmly </p><p>commented, would send the wrong message to the world </p><p>about the role of the UNHRC.  Rodrigo agreed and blamed </p><p>the current system of regional groupings for allowing </p><p>this situation to happen.  Rodrigo said he believed that </p><p>the Asia group must split, as well as the African group, </p><p>while the multiple European groups must combine. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Parmly raised the possibility of publicly voting </p><p>on whether or not Libya should be the chair as a way of </p><p>emphasizing that there is no unanimous support for </p><p>Libya.  Rodrigo responded that pushing for a vote would </p><p>likely polarize the commission and prevent substantive </p><p>work from being done.  He suggested considering </p><p>something less then a vote, such as making "statements." </p><p>He argued that such statements would stay on record for </p><p>the chair to refer to.  Parmly concurred that using </p><p>statements was a possibility, but for that option to be </p><p>effective they would have to come from non-western </p><p>countries.  Rodrigo stated that the GSL might be able to </p><p>assist in this area.  He would have to defer the final </p><p>decision to the Foreign Minister, however. </p><p> </p><p>UNHRC:  Cuba resolutions </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Parmly and Rodrigo also discussed the expected </p><p>resolutions on Cuba.  Parmly highlighted that when the </p><p>USG criticized the Cuban government for its human rights </p><p>violations, Castro seemed to thrive on the Cuba-vs.-USA </p><p>aspect of the criticism and then would just ignore the </p><p>core issues of the violations themselves.  Criticisms of </p><p>the Castro regime are thus more biting when other </p><p>nations bring the complaints forward, such as when the </p><p>Latin American countries did so last year.  Rodrigo was </p><p>generally non-committal as to how the GSL would vote on </p><p>this year\'s expected resolution on Cuba, but intimated </p><p>that it may abstain. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lankan human rights issues </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Continuing the U.S. human rights dialogue with </p><p>Sri Lanka, Parmly opened discussions with Attorney </p><p>General K.C. Kamalasabayson by expressing admiration for </p><p>the positive work Sri Lanka has done in the past year in </p><p>respect to human rights cases.  He noted that during a </p><p>January visit to Sri Lanka he had stressed to the GSL\'s </p><p>Interministerial Working Group on Human Rights that the </p><p>appearance of impunity of GSL officials alleged to have </p><p>been involved in human rights violations was an issue of </p><p>primary concern.  During the course of this year, </p><p>however, the GSL appears to be tackling the issue in </p><p>solid ways. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In his response, Kamalasabayson stated that at </p><p>the beginning of the year impunity was an issue of great </p><p>concern for his office, but that he had taken a number </p><p>of steps to counteract the history of impunity.  One of </p><p>the most drastic changes involved the fact that </p><p>historically the police investigated incidents and then </p><p>handed all information over to the Attorney General\'s </p><p>Office for prosecution.  There was no interaction </p><p>between the two branches of law.  Kamalasabayson argued </p><p>that the constitution gave him the power to direct </p><p>investigations when needed and he was doing so.  In high </p><p>profile cases or those with political aspects, State </p><p>Counsels become involved with investigations early on. </p><p>Other changes include the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Local police no longer investigate themselves.  The </p><p>Criminal Investigation Division is brought in to do </p><p>this; </p><p>-- The government is providing increased support to the </p><p>AG\'s office; </p><p>-- The AG\'s office is talking directly with NGOs and is </p><p>making a point of keeping them informed (which in turn </p><p>prevents some cases from lying dormant). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) An indication of the effectiveness of some of the </p><p>changes is that the Supreme Court has recently found </p><p>security force personnel guilty of human rights </p><p>violations.  In addition, the Supreme Court has found in </p><p>favor of victims in fundamental rights cases which </p><p>obligates the perpetrator to pay a fine to the victim. </p><p>Unlike the past, the criminal cases are also continuing </p><p>despite the fundamental rights cases having been </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) P/DAS Michael Parmly did not have the opportunity </p><p>to review this cable before departing post. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
