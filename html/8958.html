<p>UNCLAS ISTANBUL 000894 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: AKP ISTANBUL CONGRESS: "MUEZZINOGLU RELOADED" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Justice and Development (AK) Party Chairman and Prime </p><p>Minister Tayyip Erdogan headlined the June 22 AK Istanbul </p><p>Congress.  There were no surprises (in fact, no challengers </p><p>at all) in the reelection of Istanbul Chairman Mehmet </p><p>Muezzinoglu, and Erdogan\'s unscripted speech focused on </p><p>predictably populist themes that would resonate with the </p><p>10,000 party faithful and luminaries in the audience: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Education: promised free textbooks and private-school </p><p>vouchers for 10,000 students; </p><p>- Energy: promised new dams and cheaper electricity; </p><p>- Foreign Policy: promised to push forward with EU membership; </p><p>- Party Ideology: reaffirmed that AKP is a conservative </p><p>democratic party that is open to all (i.e., headscarved or </p><p>not) and committed to Ataturk\'s secularist principles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Erdogan also made news by remarking that he would soon </p><p>reveal estimates on the staggering extent of corruption in </p><p>Turkey.  He warned the labor unions not to make unreasonable </p><p>demands and cautioned all of his supporters not to expect the </p><p>economic situation to improve immediately (i.e, give us at </p><p>least 3 years).  In an indirect reference to Young Party (GP) </p><p>Chairman Cem Uzan\'s verbal attacks and subsequent legal </p><p>charges against him, Erdogan said that he was content to let </p><p>the courts handle the issue.  Following his speech, Erdogan </p><p>welcomed a few dozen new members into the party, most of whom </p><p>had defected from local positions in the Motherland Party </p><p>(ANAP), including Bahcelievler Mayor Saffet Bulut. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: Erdogan\'s speech was a further </p><p>demonstration of his political talent, charismatic appeal, </p><p>and keen understanding of his constituents.  Clearly his </p><p>die-hard Istanbul supporters are willing to give him and his </p><p>government time to make their mark, but it remains to be seen </p><p>whether the wider AK support base will be as patient. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
