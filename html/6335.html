<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000695 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; UN; NORTH KOREA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "The truth that Blix can\'t hide" </p><p>The nationalist Ottawa Citizen opined (3/12): "The </p><p>United States and Britain are angry with Hans Blix, the </p><p>United Nations chief weapons inspector in </p><p>Iraq, over the information he deliberately withheld </p><p>from his most recent public report to the Security </p><p>Council. And they\'re right to be. By keeping silent </p><p>about Iraq\'s egregious defiance of the UN, Mr. Blix not </p><p>only strengthened the hand of countries opposed to </p><p>military action against Iraq, he further weakened the </p><p>credibility and legitimacy of the Security Council </p><p>he is supposed to serve.... Hans Blix may not have been </p><p>able to bring himself to say so publicly last week, but </p><p>the case against Saddam Hussein has been made. France, </p><p>Russia and China should not stand in the way of a new </p><p>resolution that would allow that enforcement action to </p><p>begin. They should not stand in the way of truth." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Bush losing the moral high ground" </p><p>Columnist Richard Gwyn observed in the liberal Toronto </p><p>Star (3/12): "...Today, the main concern of large </p><p>numbers of people and of many governments is not to </p><p>disarm Iraq but to disarm the U.S. That\'s, of course, </p><p>impossible in the term\'s literal sense. No one can </p><p>doubt that the U.S. possesses the military capacity to </p><p>successfully invade Iraq almost by itself. </p><p>Psychological disarmament, though, is quite another </p><p>matter. It won\'t affect the political and military </p><p>leaders; George W. Bush\'s self-conviction is absolute </p><p>and adamant. But it may - just - affect American public </p><p>opinion. A lot of people around the world, and an </p><p>increasing number of governments, are acting as though </p><p>it were possible to influence ordinary Americans and </p><p>thereby to influence Bush.... The moral case...is </p><p>tilting decisively against Bush. It\'s the absence of </p><p>effective moral counter-arguments that explains why the </p><p>international scene has changed so decisively so </p><p>quickly. These days Bush is asking the world to trust </p><p>him while he has failed to trust others. He\'s said </p><p>almost nothing about moving to achieve an Israeli- </p><p>Palestinian peace settlement after Iraq is conquered. </p><p>He\'s promised to pursue democracy </p><p>in post-war Iraq but he\'s not invited the U.N., or </p><p>anyone, to help him achieve it. Quite simply, the U.S. </p><p>is increasingly alone these days because it is alone. </p><p>Once that was a good argument for rallying to the U.S. </p><p>side, because without it the U.N. will be largely </p><p>impotent and there\'ll be no-one to police the world\'s </p><p>trouble spots. The counter case is that until the U.S. </p><p>disarms - attitudinally, psychologically and </p><p>temperamentally - better a world doing its best to </p><p>function without it than one trying to keep in step </p><p>with the Americans wherever they march. Today that case </p><p>is the winning one." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "Prelude to war: Lies, deception and insincerity" </p><p>Columnist Barbara Yaffe commented in the left-of-center </p><p>Vancouver Sun (3/11): "...[A]n Iraq war was never about </p><p>disarmament, except for the purposes of passing </p><p>resolutions through the United Nations. The war for the </p><p>president is about toppling Saddam. And he hasn\'t yet </p><p>achieved that objective.... In this whole sordid </p><p>process, possibly the most off-putting spectacle has </p><p>been the performance of Mr. Bush. He has put himself </p><p>forward as a reasonable individual, an oasis of </p><p>determined calm amid chaos. This man, who will give the </p><p>order to drop thousands and thousands of bombs on Iraq </p><p>keeps repeating: \'I pray for peace. I pray for peace.\'" </p><p> </p><p>UN </p><p>4.   "Kofi\'s dithering shop" </p><p>The conservative National Post commented (3/12): </p><p>"...[I]t is the relevance of the United Nations itself, </p><p>under Mr. Annan\'s leadership, that is at </p><p>greatest risk of impairment. France is so desperate to </p><p>thwart U.S. military plans that it is willing to veto </p><p>any war resolution Washington puts before the Security </p><p>Council, and thereby vitiate the 17 existing Iraq- </p><p>related Security Council resolutions that the United </p><p>States is seeking to enforce. Mr. Annan should be </p><p>rallying other members of the Security Council around </p><p>to the U.S. position. If the Secretary-General fails in </p><p>this regard and the United States and Britain liberate </p><p>Iraq without explicit UN approval, Mr. </p><p>Annan may find that no one particularly cares what he - </p><p>or the United Nations - has to say the next time an </p><p>international crisis emerges." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "Turnabout at the UN" </p><p>The centrist Winnipeg Free Press opined (3/8): "...The </p><p>new resolution offered by the U.S. and its allies dares </p><p>France and the others to claim that peaceful means of </p><p>disarming Iraq have succeeded, which is obviously not </p><p>the case. It shifts to them the onus of proving that </p><p>Iraq\'s conduct is acceptable. In the interest of </p><p>international peace and security, the main thing is </p><p>that Iraq\'s aggression should not be tolerated. If Iraq </p><p>is allowed to rearm and if economic sanctions are </p><p>lifted, then Iraq will be excused from the consequences </p><p>of its aggression against Kuwait. This will tend to </p><p>reassure other heavily armed nations that they need </p><p>fear no punishment from the UN if they follow Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s example and invade neighbouring countries. In </p><p>the new resolution, the U.S. is making a further effort </p><p>to conduct its operations against Iraq under the aegis </p><p>of the United Nations. This is both principled and </p><p>tactically wise. The U.S. public and the people of </p><p>other nations much prefer the U.S. to get UN approval </p><p>before it goes to war. President Bush will enjoy much </p><p>better support at home and abroad if he acts with UN </p><p>approval. The interests of Canada and other middle- </p><p>sized countries are best served if the UN continues to </p><p>provide a mechanism in which nations can unite their </p><p>efforts to oppose aggression. Canada should join in </p><p>urging Security Council adoption of this new </p><p>resolution." </p><p> </p><p>NORTH KOREA </p><p>6.   "Nuclear blackmail" </p><p>The centrist Winnipeg Free Press commented (3/12): </p><p>"...Mr. Kim needs a new sponsor and he sees the U.S. as </p><p>the most likely candidate. Because it will not </p><p>willingly subsidize his brutally oppressive and corrupt </p><p>regime, his only recourse is nuclear blackmail. He </p><p>worked that scam successfully with former president </p><p>Bill Clinton; he is having less success with Mr. Bush </p><p>and so can be expected to intensify his efforts to get </p><p>the attention and the cash he craves. Mr. Bush should </p><p>not do as Mr. Clinton did and submit to Mr. Kim\'s </p><p>blackmail - whether the demand is unfettered aid or the </p><p>abandonment of South Korea. Mr. Kim wants to deal only </p><p>and directly with the U.S. This is not just an American </p><p>problem, however; it is a United Nations one, although </p><p>few of that organization\'s members appear to be as </p><p>eager for a multilateral approach to North Korea as </p><p>they are in demanding one for Iraq." </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
