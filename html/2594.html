<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MASS, EIND, ETRD, PGOV, MASS, EIND, ETRD, IT, ITPREL, AVIATION </p><p>SUBJECT: JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER:  STRENGTHENING THE THIRD LEG </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CDA POPE FOR REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) VARIOUS PLAYERS IN THE DECISION FOR ITALY TO </p><p>BECOME A PARTNER IN THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER HAVE </p><p>PREVENTED U.S. INDUSTRY FROM BUILDING THE TRI-PARTITE </p><p>COALITION NECESSARY TO SIGN ON TO JSF.  WHILE WE HAVE BEEN </p><p>TOLD REPEATEDLY THAT SIGNING JSF IS A \'DONE DEAL\', WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT ONLY TWO OF THE THREE LEGS HAVE BEEN BUILT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01239  01 OF 02  120314Z </p><p>THE MILITARY HAS MADE JSF ITS CHOICE; THE POLITICAL </p><p>INDICATORS ARE THAT ITALY WILL JOIN.  WHAT HAS BEEN LACKING </p><p>IS A WIDE UNDERSTANDING OF THE INDUSTRIAL BENEFITS.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S CALL ON MINISTER OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES </p><p>MARZANO WENT A LONG WAY TO CORRECT THAT DEFICIENCY.  HIS </p><p>PRESENTATION GALVANIZED THE MINISTER INTO SEEKING A </p><p>DETAILED BRIEFING OF THE INDUSTRIAL MERITS FOR HIS </p><p>\'TECHNICAL STAFF\' AND MAY HAVE PRECIPITATED THE DECISION </p><p>TO REQUEST AN INTER-MINISTERIAL MEETING TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>JSF.  THE TECHNICAL BRIEFING OCCURRED THE NEXT DAY AND </p><p>SHOWED HOW DEEPLY INGRAINED IS THE SOCIAL WELFARE NEED TO </p><p>HAVE GUARANTEED JOBS AND WORK SHARE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WE UNDERSTAND THAT TO SELL THE JSF IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT WE NEED TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT ADDRESS THESE </p><p>ISSUES.  OUR NEXT STEPS TO BUILD CONSENSUS ARE, AT AN </p><p>APPROPRIATE TIME, TO ENCOURAGE LOCKHEED TO (1) CALL </p><p>DIRECTLY ON THE MINISTRY OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES </p><p>TECHNICAL STAFF TO DISCUSS THE INDUSTRIAL COMPONENT, AND </p><p>TO (2) URGE ALL THE ITALIAN SUB-PRIMES TO EXPLAIN TO </p><p>THEIR PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATIVES WHAT CONTRACTS MIGHT </p><p>BE POSSIBLE (OR IN THOSE CASES OF SIGNED LETTERS OF INTENT </p><p>TO BE MORE EXPLICIT) AND SEEK THEIR SUPPORT FOR JSF. </p><p>ALSO, AT THE RIGHT TIME, THE EMBASSY MAY NEED TO BECOME </p><p>INVOLVED IN PRESENTING THE JSF CASE TO THE PARLIAMENT, NOT </p><p>JUST TO THE GOVERNMENT.  WE MAY ALSO SEEK TO COUNTERACT </p><p>THE OFF-SET, GUARANTEE MIND-SET OF SOME ITALIANS BY </p><p>SHOWING GRAPHICALLY A STEP-WISE PROGRESSION OF ITALIAN </p><p>PAYMENTS BALANCED WITH INDUSTRIAL RETURNS TO INDIVIDUAL </p><p>ITALIAN FIRMS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01239  01 OF 02  120314Z </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) TUESDAY, MARCH 5, THE AMBASSADOR PAID A COURTESY </p><p>CALL ON MINISTER FOR PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES, ANTONIO </p><p>MARZANO.  ALSO PRESENT WERE DCM POPE, ECMIN DEAN, AND MPA </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR GABRIELE CHECCHIA.  THE MEETING </p><p>PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSED TWO TOPICS:  MARZANO\'S RECENT VISIT </p><p>TO IRAN AND OUR ADVOCACY FOR THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER. </p><p>IRAN IS COVERED SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>PUSH FOR JSF </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR OPENED THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER </p><p>DISCUSSION BY LAYING OUT THE NATURE OF THE NEW BUSINESS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP THAT LOCKHEED IS SEEKING:  NOT OFFSETS, NOT </p><p>GUARANTEES, BUT A PARTNERSHIP BASED ON COMPETITIVE, </p><p>HIGH-TECH PARTICIPANTS.  HE STRESSED THAT THE U.S. IS </p><p>ASKING ITS CLOSEST ALLIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS NEW </p><p>TECHNOLOGY AND IN THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP WHICH SHARES </p><p>PROPORTIONALLY DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND COMMERCIAL RETURNS. </p><p>HE REVIEWED THE TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES OF THE JSF AS A </p><p>LETHAL, HIGHLY STEALTHY FIGHTER, AS A VERTICAL LANDING </p><p>FIGHTER, AND AS A SHORT TAKE-OFF AIRCRAFT, SUITABLE </p><p>FOR CARRIERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THEN COVERED THE PARTICIPATION OF </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES, AND THE U.S. INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN 25 </p><p>BILLION DOLLARS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY, POINTING </p><p>OUT THE PROJECTED RETURN OF 9-12 BILLION DOLLARS FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01239  01 OF 02  120314Z </p><p>ITALY\'S ONE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>STRESSED SEVERAL TIMES THE NEW COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE </p><p>PARTNERSHIP, AND HOW IT WOULD KEEP COSTS IN CHECK.  WE ALSO </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT HAVING A CENTRAL COORDINATOR, SUCH AS </p><p>ALENIA, FOR THE ITALIAN CONTRACTORS WOULD DRIVE UP THE </p><p>COST, AND THAT LOCKHEED, PRATT AND WITTNEY AND GE ARE </p><p>COMMITTED TO WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE SUB-PRIMES.  WE LAID </p><p>OUT THE SPECIFIC FIRMS AND THE ANTICIPATED VOLUME OF </p><p>CONTRACTS THAT THEY COULD WIN.  THE MINISTER WAS UNAWARE OF </p><p>THE EXTENSIVE POSSIBILITIES FOR ITALIAN CONTRACTORS. </p><p> </p><p>VIS--VIS THE EUROFIGHTER </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WE RECOGNIZED, UP FRONT, THAT THE COMPETITION IS </p><p>NOT BETWEEN THE EUROFIGHTER AND THE JSF, BUT RATHER THAT </p><p>THE MOD CONSIDERS THEM COMPLEMENTARY.  MARZANO WAS QUICK </p><p>TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO REMOVE THE ALENIA INTERMEDIARY </p><p>AND THE SECONDARY IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE ON PUTTING A </p><p>COMPETITIVE LID ON EUROFIGHTER COSTS.  IN ADDITION TO </p><p>SHOWING THE GRAPHICS OF CONTRACT POTENTIAL, WE MADE THE </p><p>CASE THAT THE JSF WILL HAVE MORE EU PARTICIPANTS THAN THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3350 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01239  02 OF 02  120314Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------72DEC8  120315Z /30 </p><p>R 110729Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 2667 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//USD(ATL)// </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MASS, EIND, ETRD, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER:  STRENGTHENING THE THIRD LEG </p><p> </p><p>EUROFIGHTER. </p><p> </p><p>TECHNICAL BRIEF </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WE DID A FOLLOW-UP BRIEF WITH THE \'TECHNICAL </p><p>STAFF\', WHICH WAS DIRECTOR GENERAL VISCONTI AND DR. </p><p>CUZZONI, THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE OFFICIAL ON THE JSF IN THE </p><p>MPA.  WE DELIVERED THE SAME POINTS, WITH MORE DETAILS, BUT </p><p>CONFRONTED THREE SPECIFIC INTER-RELATED PROBLEMS.  ONE, THE </p><p>MOST INTENSE, WAS THE NEED TO SHOW A GUARANTEED RETURN TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01239  02 OF 02  120314Z </p><p>ITALY, SPECIFICALLY IN WORK SHARE.  PROMISES FROM THE PRIME </p><p>CONTRACTORS DID NOT/NOT REASSURE THEM IN THE SLIGHTEST. </p><p>WE SAID THAT SO FAR EIGHT LETTERS OF INTENT HAD BEEN SIGNED </p><p>AND THAT WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT AGREEMENT, </p><p>CONTRACTS COULD NOT BE SIGNED.  WE BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT </p><p>PRESSURE FROM ALENIA ON THE ITALIAN SUB-PRIMES TO WITHHOLD </p><p>SIGNING LOIS THERE MIGHT BE EVEN MORE.  WE DID POINT OUT </p><p>THAT SINCE ITALY IS PAYING ITS SHARE OVER TEN YEARS, </p><p>CONTRACTS COMING IN SHOULD BALANCE EXPENSES, BUT THAT NO </p><p>ONE WAS GOING TO PROVIDE \'GUARANTEES\'.  IN THE OUT YEARS </p><p>OF COURSE THERE WOULD BE REAL RETURN TO ITALY ON </p><p>INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE SECOND PROBLEM WAS THE COST, WHICH RELATED TO </p><p>THE THIRD PROBLEM:  VISCONTI AND CUZZONI STATED THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SIMPLY COULD NOT SELL CONTRACTOR PROMISES IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  THE PROBLEM, FROM THE DOMESTIC POLITICIAN\'S </p><p>POINT OF VIEW, IS THAT THE OUTLAYS FOR DEVELOPMENT YIELD </p><p>RETURNS ONLY FOR THEIR LOCAL CONSTITUENCIES MANY YEARS OUT, </p><p>LONG AFTER THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE CREDIT FOR A WISE </p><p>INVESTMENT.  VISCONTI AND CUZZONI FELT FAILURE TO GAIN </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE JSF IN PARLIAMENT DURING THE ANNUAL BUDGET </p><p>DEBATE WOULD WEAKEN THE GOVERNMENT.  VISCONTI WAS </p><p>PARTICULARLY CLEAR THAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR FOR JSF </p><p>FOR 10 YEARS ABSORBS ALL THE DISCRETIONARY INCOME THAT </p><p>ITALY HAS TO INVEST IN OTHER AREAS OF THE ECONOMY.  THIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AS ANY SOCIAL WELFARE STATE IN EUROPE, IS </p><p>CONCERNED WITH WORK SHARE AND UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE INEVITABLE </p><p>QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01239  02 OF 02  120314Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION, MARZANO </p><p>TURNED TO CHECCHIA AND ASKED WHAT JSF WAS.  LATER, NEAR THE </p><p>END, HE ASKED IF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE KNEW WHAT WE WERE </p><p>TELLING HIM.  WE ASSURED HIM THAT MOD WAS NOT ONLY FULLY </p><p>BRIEFED, BUT THAT JSF WAS STRONGLY DESIRED BY MOD. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) OUR DISCUSSION WITH MARZANO ON JSF REVEALED JUST </p><p>HOW TIGHTLY ALENIA AND THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE HAS BEEN </p><p>HOLDING INFORMATION, DESPITE REPEATED ASSURANCES THAT THIS </p><p>WOULD BE AN INTER-MINISTERIAL PROCESS.  WE FIND THIS TO BE </p><p>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE SINCE EVENTUALLY THIS WILL BECOME A </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUE:  THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO SELL JSF TO </p><p>THE PARLIAMENT AS A BUDGET LINE ITEM.  IN LOOKING AT HOW WE </p><p>COULD IMPROVE THE PROSPECTS FOR LIMITED COLLATERAL DAMAGE </p><p>TO THE PROGRAM AND TO THE GOVERNMENT, WE ARE SUGGESTING </p><p>THAT </p><p> </p><p>--LOCKHEED COULD CALL DIRECTLY ON THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES TO DISCUSS THE INDUSTRIAL COMPONENT. </p><p> </p><p>--LOCKHEED COULD ENCOURAGE ALL THE ITALIAN SUB-PRIMES TO </p><p>TALK TO THEIR PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATIVES AND EXPLAIN </p><p>WHAT CONTRACTS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE (OR IN THOSE CASES OF </p><p>LETTERS OF INTENT TO BE MORE EXPLICIT). </p><p> </p><p>--THE EMBASSY MAY NEED TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE LATER IN </p><p>PRESENTING THE JSF CASE TO THE PARLIAMENT, NOT JUST TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01239  02 OF 02  120314Z </p><p> </p><p>--WE MIGHT SEEK TO COUNTERACT THE OFF-SET, GUARANTEE </p><p>MIND-SET OF THE ITALIANS BY SHOWING GRAPHICALLY A STEP-WISE </p><p>PROGRESSION OF ITALIAN PAYMENTS BALANCED WITH RETURNS TO </p><p>INDIVIDUAL FIRMS, NOT JUST FOR THE 10 PERIOD IN WHICH ITALY </p><p>IS PAYING ITS ONE BILLION BUT IN OUT YEAR RETURNS. </p><p>POPE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01239 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
