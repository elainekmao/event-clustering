SUMMARY: On July 2, an opinion article on Iraq by </p><p>Ambassador Edmund Hull, entitled "Toward a Free Iraq: </p><p>Security, Economic, Political Efforts on Track" was </p><p>widely distributed to the Yemeni press.  Out of about 29 </p><p>newspapers, six independent papers published the article </p><p>plus the al-Sahwa.net website.  At least four papers </p><p>reacted to the article, saying it did not change the </p><p>minds of Yemenis about what is happening in Iraq. End </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. Commenting on the article, "Annas" independent weekly </p><p>(of Islamic orientation), published an article July 7 </p><p>entitled "Forget it Mr. Hull."  The paper commented that </p><p>"Mr. Hull wrote the article as if he were an Arab </p><p>ambassador for quoting President Bush as Arab ambassadors </p><p>usually do when they quote their leaders."  Annas </p><p>indicated that the Yemeni people will not believe what </p><p>the Ambassador is saying that all efforts made by the </p><p>Americans in Iraq will serve to improve the lives of the </p><p>Iraqi people "even if he (the Ambassador) writes a </p><p>thousand articles a day."  The paper stressed that </p><p>Yemenis are not concerned about the future of the people </p><p>of Iraq "as much as they are concerned about the US </p><p>Ambassador\'s movements and activities in Yemen which only </p><p>God knows where they will lead." </p><p> </p><p>3. Al-Sahwa weekly, mouthpiece of the Yemeni Congregation </p><p>for Reform (Islah party), indicated that the U.S. image </p><p>in the eighties of last century was that of a country </p><p>helping and supporting poor nations.  "America\'s image </p><p>now" the paper added "is that of a haughty President; of </p><p>a frowning politician; of a soldier armed with fear and </p><p>might and ready to strike and kill; and of disreputable </p><p>informers - all of which do not convey the message of </p><p>justice and truth."   The paper indicated that the </p><p>"atrocious pictures Yemenis see on TV everyday of what </p><p>the Americans are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan are more </p><p>truthful than what the U.S. Ambassador is trying to tell </p><p>us." </p><p> </p><p>4. The anti-American (putatively independent) weekly "al- </p><p>Shumu\'" commented that it was not very diplomatic for </p><p>Ambassador Hull to portray the "reckless" American </p><p>practices in Iraq as something "grand".  The paper added </p><p>that the article\'s message was not "very persuasive" </p><p>since it clashes with Yemenis\' convictions about what is </p><p>happening on the ground in Iraq.  Al-Shumu\' concluded </p><p>that the U.S. Administration has lost credibility in the </p><p>world for following a "Hollywood-like thinking." </p><p> </p><p>5. "Al-Ihya\'a al-Arabi" (mouthpiece of the Socialist </p><p>Nationalist Ba\'athist party, extremely anti-American) </p><p>described the circulation of the US Ambassador\'s article </p><p>in the Yemeni press as "a silly move".  It reported that </p><p>if "the Ambassador knew how much the Yemeni people hate </p><p>the pro-Zionist US administrations, he wouldn\'t send the </p><p>article."  The paper criticized the newspapers that </p><p>published the article and commended the ones that did </p><p>not. </p><p> </p><p>6. COMMENT: This is the first time that we have been able </p><p>to place an article on Iraq in so many Yemeni newspapers, </p><p>despite our continued and insistent attempts.  The </p><p>reaction it has produced is not very surprising because </p><p>the mood here on Iraq is still anti-coalition.  Following </p><p>on the heels of this placement, we have devised a plan to </p><p>continue to seek a more balanced reporting by the Yemeni </p><p>press (see septel). </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
