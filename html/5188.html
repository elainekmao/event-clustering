<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 000467 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR H (PLEASE PASS TO CODEL WARNER), EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, OVIP, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR CODEL WARNER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Your visit comes at a critical time in US-Turkey </p><p>relations.  Over the last two years the US has supported IMF </p><p>packages of unprecedented proportions to assist Turkey in </p><p>recovering from its worst economic crisis in decades.  The </p><p>strategic partnership has grown as a result of Turkey\'s </p><p>significant support in the global war on terrorism, including </p><p>taking leadership of the International Security Assistance </p><p>Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.  In the last six months, the </p><p>governing coalition of Bulent Ecevit crumbled and was </p><p>replaced in November elections by the first majority </p><p>government in over ten years.  The new Islam-influenced AK </p><p>Party holds almost two-thirds of the seats in Parliament and </p><p>has had to settle in quickly to react to EU and Cyprus issues </p><p>as well as the growing tension with Iraq.  Turkey has </p><p>indicated that it will cooperate with the US if a military </p><p>operation in Iraq is necessary, but the conditions and limits </p><p>of that cooperation are still being negotiated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Political Scene </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The AK Party, which won a landslide victory on Nov. </p><p>3 and controls 362 (of 550) seats in the legislature, assumed </p><p>power on Nov 18.  It moved quickly to promote Turkey\'s EU </p><p>candidacy by passing a package of long overdue human rights </p><p>reforms, and with strong USG support garnered an EU </p><p>conditional date of end-2004 for the beginning of formal EU </p><p>accession talks.  In other areas, AK\'s inexperience and lack </p><p>of expertise is hampering rapid decisions on complex issues. </p><p>As a result, AK is perceived as uncertain over: 1) its </p><p>commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline during a time of </p><p>economic fragility; and 2) whether, and to what extent, to </p><p>support USG efforts in Iraq -- while trying to placate an </p><p>electorate that is overwhelmingly opposed to war.  AK, with </p><p>its roots in Islamic politics, is further handicapped by poor </p><p>relations with a Kemalist State that is loath to tolerate </p><p>most expressions of religiosity, and which sees AK as a </p><p>challenge to its dominance and to the status quo.   In this </p><p>regard, the heavily Kemalist judiciary launched a case to </p><p>close AK some 10 days before the last elections.  Elements of </p><p>the State apparatus are also trying to keep the pressure on </p><p>AK and its leader, R. Tayyip Erdogan, currently banned from </p><p>elective politics, by continually trying to erect judicial or </p><p>administrative roadblocks to Erdogan\'s return to politics and </p><p>assumption of the prime ministership.  On Jan. 8, Turkish </p><p>General Staff issued a strong warning to AK -- whose poll </p><p>numbers have been on the upswing since the elections -- to </p><p>abandon policies allegedly at odds with the principles of the </p><p>Kemalist Republic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus </p><p>====== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) AK Government has been far ahead of its </p><p>predecessors in pushing for a solution on Cyprus -- and </p><p>taking "TRNC President" Denktas to task for his approach to </p><p>negotiating the draft UN Cyprus settlement plan. </p><p>Negotiations to reach a solution in the decades-old Cyprus </p><p>dispute continue, against the backdrop of unprecedented, </p><p>massive demonstrations in Turkish Cyprus aimed at both </p><p>Denktas and the Turkish Establishment that has long nurtured </p><p>him.  AK leader Erdogan and other AK officials have openly </p><p>criticized not only Denktas but, by implication, Turkey\'s </p><p>traditional policy -- which while earning praise from the </p><p>public (in Turkey and in northern Cyprus) has helped raise </p><p>tensions with elements of the military and its bureaucratic </p><p>allies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Current UN efforts call for the parties to cut a </p><p>deal by February 28, which would allow sufficient time for a </p><p>settlement to be incorporated into Cyprus\' EU accession </p><p>treaty.  (The EU at its December summit in Copenhagen agreed </p><p>to admit Cyprus; the treaty will be signed in April). </p><p>Turkish sensitivities include: 1) the need to maintain </p><p>security for Turkish Cypriots (and mainland Turkish </p><p>"strategic" interests on the island); and 2) the question of </p><p>territorial adjustments and the right of displaced Greek </p><p>Cypriots to return to (or seek restitution for) their former </p><p>properties.  Turkish journalists with connections to the </p><p>Establishment have been promoting a quid-pro-quo for Turkey, </p><p>arguing that Turkey should tie its level of cooperation with </p><p>the US on Iraq to US "support" for Turkish positions </p><p>regarding Cyprus -- a linkage we have explicitly rejected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Political-Military Issues </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Iraq: The US and Turkey are engaged in intense and </p><p>detailed discussions about Iraq, including possible military </p><p>operations.  The Turkish public is overwhelmingly opposed to </p><p>a military operation against Iraq and the AK Party Government </p><p>is trying to balance its desire to build on Turkey\'s </p><p>strategic relationship with the US and maintain public </p><p>support.  Turks fear that an Iraq war would have a serious </p><p>negative economic impact on them and could lead to increased </p><p>instability next door and in Turkey\'s restive southeast.  We </p><p>are confident that at the end of the day, Turkey will support </p><p>us, but we and the Turkish government have considerable work </p><p>to do to re-assure the Turkish public that their interests </p><p>will be looked after. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Operation Northern Watch: Turkey continues to </p><p>support Operation Northern Watch (the northern no-fly zone) </p><p>based out of Incirlik, which was again renewed for six months </p><p>on Christmas Day.  The Turks also have good relations with </p><p>the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and had a visit from </p><p>Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Masoud Barzani the first </p><p>week of January which helped put what had become a tense and </p><p>unhappy relationship back on a more cooperative footing.  The </p><p>Turks are strong supporters of the Iraqi Turkmen Front, and </p><p>have recently begun meeting for the first time with Iraqi </p><p>opposition groups other than the KDP, PUK, and the ITF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Global War on Terrorism: Immediately after 9/11, </p><p>Turkey opened its infrastructure to the US military for the </p><p>GWOT and supported the invocation of Article V at NATO. </p><p>Turkey has granted clearance to over 8000 US sorties in </p><p>support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in and through </p><p>Turkey. The GOT has also offered special operations forces </p><p>and aerial refuelers for Operation Enduring Freedom.  But </p><p>chief among the GOT\'s contribution was its agreement to take </p><p>over leadership of the International Security Assistance </p><p>Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan in June 2002, which it will </p><p>relinquish in February. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) NATO: Ankara was supportive of the US agenda at the </p><p>NATO Prague Summit in November, including our push for NATO </p><p>expansion and improved capabilities.  Turkey\'s primary </p><p>concern is keeping the three NATO commands currently located </p><p>in Turkey after the command structure review is conducted in </p><p>Brussels which seeks to streamline (and thus cut) the number </p><p>of commands.  In an effort to obtain international legitimacy </p><p>and public support for a potential military operation in </p><p>Iraq, the GOT, with US assistance, is attempting to pave the </p><p>way for NATO support should Turkey come under attack from </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economic Issues </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Economic Crisis: Although nearly two years of </p><p>IMF-backed economic reform have laid the foundation for </p><p>greater financial stability and growth, Turkey\'s enormous </p><p>public debt burden and structural weaknesses keep the economy </p><p>fragile.  The key during 2003 is to maintain market </p><p>confidence, so investors will continue to lend the government </p><p>the massive amounts it needs to avoid a debt default. </p><p>Markets initially greeted the AK election victory, and AK\'s </p><p>commitment to further economic reform, with a rally.  So far, </p><p>however, the government\'s performance has been disappointing. </p><p> Rather than pursue reform, the government has adopted </p><p>populist spending policies and moved to dismantle some key </p><p>reforms.  Strong international and market pressure over the </p><p>past few weeks have forced the government to respond, </p><p>including with announcements of new fiscal and privatization </p><p>measures, but it is still not clear whether the government </p><p>will implement the full reform program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Trade Relationship: In January 2002, President Bush </p><p>and then-Prime Minister Ecevit committed to enhance the </p><p>bilateral economic relationship.  One pillar of that </p><p>initiative is superb cooperation on building an East-West </p><p>energy corridor to bring Caspian oil and gas through Turkey </p><p>to the West.  The U.S. administration has also submitted </p><p>Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ) legislation to the Congress. </p><p> Turkish expectations about US economic support remain high, </p><p>particularly in the context of a possible Iraq operation. </p><p>They are looking to the U.S. to provide substantial financial </p><p>support to offset expected losses and keep the overall </p><p>economy afloat, and to offer new trade initiatives to boost </p><p>exports and offset possible job losses.  In the Turkish view, </p><p>both types of assistance are essential if the government is </p><p>to overcome widespread public opposition to an operation. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
