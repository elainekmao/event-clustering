<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 09 KHARTOUM 03477 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO OAU COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, ECON, MASS, KPRP, SU </p><p>SUBJECT: SUDAN AND THE ARABS:  POSSIBLY STEP-SISTERS; </p><p>         CERTAINLY NOT BROTHERS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  SUDAN\'S ARAB RELATIONSHIPS HAVE UNDERGONE A </p><p>METAMORPHOSIS SINCE THE MILITARY COUP OF JUNE 1989.  MOST </p><p>ARAB STATES REACTED WARMLY TO THE OUSTER OF SADIQ AL- </p><p>MAHDI.  SINCE THEN, THIS WARMTH HAS DISSIPATED AS AN </p><p>UNENLIGHTENED GOS HAS DRIFTED TOWARD LIBYA FOR SUSTENANCE. </p><p>THE GOS HAS TRIED TO GLOSS OVER ITS PECULIAR INTEGRATION </p><p>PLAN WITH LIBYA BY DEPICTING IT AS A STEP TOWARD ARAB </p><p>UNITY.  WHILE SOUTHERN SUDANESE BLAME ARAB INFLUENCE FOR </p><p>THEIR TROUBLES, SUDAN\'S ARAB IMPULSES REFLECT EXPEDIENCY </p><p>MORE THAN CONVICTION.  OTHER THAN HISTORICAL, MULTIFACETED </p><p>LINKAGES WITH EGYPT, SUDAN\'S ARAB TIES ARE LARGELY DRIVEN </p><p>BY PROSPECTS OF JOBS AND AID, ESPECIALLY DONATION OF KEY </p><p>COMMODITIES (WHEAT AND OIL) AND MILITARY MATERIAL.  THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS TEND TO BE ONE-SIDED--SUDAN IS A WILLING </p><p>RECIPIENT WITH LITTLE, EXCEPT RHETORIC AND ITS </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY IN THE CASE OF LIBYA, TO OFFER.  AMONG ARABS, </p><p>EGYPT IS MOST MINDFUL OF SUDAN WITH CONCERNS FOR WATER </p><p>RESOURCES AND STABILITY.  SUDANESE ARE DRAWN TO EGYPT--AS </p><p>MANY AS A MILLION MAY LIVE THERE--AND RELY ON ITS </p><p>BENEFICIENCE BUT ARE QUICK TO BRIDLE AT PERCEIVED </p><p>MEDDLING.  PRIME TARGETS FOR GOS SOLICITATIONS ARE LIBYA </p><p>(RECEPTIVE), IRAQ (ONCE RECEPTIVE) AND SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>(DISENCHANTED).  MEANWHILE LARGE SUDANESE COMMUNITIES IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT AND THE UAE REMAIN KEY SOURCES FOR </p><p>PRIVATE INCOME AND BADLY NEEDED BUT DECLINING </p><p>INVESTMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p> </p><p>3.  SUDAN, WITH ITS ETHNIC AMALGAM STRETCHING SOUTH OF </p><p>THE SAHARA, DOES NOT FIT COMFORTABLY INTO THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD.  TO BE SURE, ARAB CULTURE--LANGUAGE, MEDIA, THE </p><p>ARTS, HISTORY, MANNERS--PERMEATES NORTHERN SUDANESE </p><p>THINKING AND BEHAVIOR, AND ITS INFLUENCE IS EVIDENT EVEN </p><p>AMONG SOUTHERNERS PRONE TO RESIST IT.  MOREOVER, SUDAN\'S </p><p>POLITICAL AND MILITARY INSTITUTIONS ARE DOMINATED BY </p><p>MEMBERS OF RIVERINE, EASTERN AND WESTERN TRIBES </p><p>CONVENTIONALLY CLASSIFIED AS ARAB.  AS POLITICS GO, </p><p>HOWEVER, THIS ARABIST LINK, INTRODUCED BY THE EGYPTIANS, </p><p>IS IN MANY WAYS AN ARTIFICIAL CONCEPTION.  SUDANESE, </p><p>EMBROILED IN THEIR OWN NATIONAL AND PERSONAL PROBLEMS, </p><p>ARE NOT EMOTIONALLY DRIVEN BY "ARAB ISSUES" LIKE THE </p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT AND THE IRANIAN THREAT, </p><p>EXCEPT AS THEY BEAR A MORE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP, E.G. </p><p>ISRAEL\'S ETHIOPIAN TIES AND ITS ALLEGED LINKS WITH THE </p><p>SPLA.  RELIGIOUS AND RACIAL FACTORS--THE HISTORIC STAIN </p><p>OF THE ARAB SLAVE TRADE, INSTANCES OF DISCRIMINATION, AND </p><p>PERCEPTIONS OF ISLAMIC NONCONFORMITY--ALSO DISTANCE </p><p>SUDANESE SOMEWHAT FROM THE ARAB MAINSTREAM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  NOTWITHSTANDING AMBIVALENT EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO </p><p>THE OFFICIAL PRONOUNCEMENTS, PARTICIPATES IN THE </p><p>INNUMERABLE ARAB GATHERINGS AND HIGHLIGHTS ITS ARAB </p><p>CREDENTIALS WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO THE EXTENT OF </p><p>UNDERTAKING AIRY UNITY PROJECTS.  THE REASON IS PLAINLY </p><p>SELF-INTEREST.  SUDAN EMBRACES ARABISM BECAUSE IT </p><p>LITERALLY PAYS TO DO SO.  SUFFERING FROM AN INTERMINABLE </p><p>WAR AND ECONOMIC DEVASTATION, SUDAN NEEDS THE JOB AND AID </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARAB COUNTRIES CAN AND SOMETIMES DO </p><p>PROVIDE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WHILE NORTHERN SUDANESE TEND TO ACCEPT THEIR ARAB </p><p>STATUS AS USEFUL, SOUTHERNERS PERCEIVE ARABS AS THE </p><p>PROBLEM.  TO SOUTHERNERS, "ARAB" HAS BECOME A PEJORATIVE </p><p>TERM REPRESENTING UNJUST AND OPPRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. </p><p>PASSING OVER SUDAN\'S ETHNIC DIVERSITY, TRADITIONAL </p><p>RIVALRIES AND IDEOLOGICAL DIVISIONS, THEY ARE FOND OF </p><p>BLAMING THE ARABS FOR MISRULE AND INEQUITY.  A FREQUENT </p><p>SOUTHERN REFRAIN IS THAT ARABS CONSTITUTE ONLY A </p><p>MINORITY, THOUGH A PLURALITY, IN SUDAN, WHICH IS PROBABLY </p><p>TRUE.  BASED ON THIS ASSUMPTION, SOUTHERNERS ARGUE THAT </p><p>THEIR UNITING WITH NONARAB NORTHERNERS--SUCH AS THE NUBA, </p><p>THE FUR, AND THE NUBIANS--COULD RESOLVE SUDAN\'S DIVISIVE </p><p>PROBLEMS.  THE IMPROBABILITY OF THIS THESIS ONLY </p><p>UNDERSCORES ITS FALLACY.  RELIGIOUS, IDEOLOGICAL AND </p><p>TRADITIONAL TRIBAL DIVISIONS OUTWEIGH THE ISSUE OF ARAB </p><p>TIES.  THE FUR OF DARFUR, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE MORE AT EASE </p><p>WITH ARAB MUSLIMS, EXCEPTING PERHAPS THEIR RIZEIGAT </p><p>ADVERSARIES, THAN WITH SOUTHERN CHRISTIANS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE ARAB WORLD, FOR THE MOST PART, LOOKS ON SUDAN AS </p><p>CHRONICALLY WAYWARD WITH SELF-INDUCED PROBLEMS.  SUDANESE </p><p>ARE VIEWED AS PERSONABLE, RESPECTFUL OF AUTHORITY, AND </p><p>DEPENDABLE WORKERS ABROAD BUT, AT HOME, HOPELESSLY </p><p>INCAPABLE OF MANAGING THEMSELVES.  EXASPERATION AND </p><p>PATERNALISM ARE STANDARD ARAB RESPONSES.  BROODING ABOUT </p><p>BURDENSOME AND UNSAFE (THE UAE AMBASSADOR WAS NEARLY </p><p>ASSASSINATED IN 1988) LIVING CONDITIONS, ARAB DIPLOMATS </p><p>IN KHARTOUM UNIFORMLY CRAVE EARLY REASSIGNMENTS.  THEIR </p><p>AVOIDANCE OF THE WESTERN DIPLOMATIC CIRCUIT (EXCEPTING </p><p>EGYPT ABD MOROCCO) IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THEIR </p><p>INDUSTRY, THOUGH SOME ARE NOTICEABLY UNINFORMED AND </p><p>UNPRODUCTIVE   THE EGYPTIANS ARE THE MOST NUMBEROUS, </p><p>ACTIVE, VISIBLE AND BEST INFORMED OF ARAB DIPLOMATS. </p><p>DIPLOMATS FROM WEALTHIER ARAB STATES ALSO SOCIALIZE </p><p>REGULARLY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  HOWEVER, THEY ARE </p><p>USUALLY ASKED FOR MORE ASSISTANCE THAN ADVICE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  TWO AXIOMS WELL DEFINE THE STATE OF SUDAN\'S ARAB </p><p>RELATIONS TODAY.  FIRST, A SENSE OF DEJA VU PREVAILS. </p><p>IRRESOLUTE DECISIONMAKING AND ZIGZAGING POLICIES </p><p>CHARACTERIZING SADIQ AL-MAHDI\'S GOVERNMENTS HAS ALSO </p><p>PLAGUED THEIR MILITARY SUCCESSOR PUSHING SUDAN TOWARD </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION AND IRRELEVANCE.  SADIQ\'S OUSTER </p><p>IN JUNE 1989 WAS WELCOMED HEARTILY BY MOST ARABS.  THE </p><p>FORMER PRIME MINISTER\'S INCOMPETENT RULE, TACTLESS </p><p>CONDUCT AND FLIRTATIONS WITH THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT </p><p>(NIF) AND IRAN MANAGED TO ANTAGONIZE PRACTICALLY ALL </p><p>ARABS SAVE LIBYA.  THESE EARLY CHEERS SOURED HOWEVER AS </p><p>THE RCC RAPIDLY REVEALED THEIR OWN BRAND OF ECONOMIC </p><p>MISMANAGEMENT, INABILITY TO COMPROMISE FOR PEACE AND A </p><p>POLITICAL AGENDA WHICH IS ATTRACTIVE TO ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS.  THE REGIME WHICH BEGAN BY COLD </p><p>SHOULDERING THE LIBYANS AND MAKING OVERTURES TO MODERATE </p><p>ARABS GRADUALLY REVERTED, BECAUSE OF NECESSITY, TO WHERE </p><p>SUDAN\'S WARMEST PUBLIC RELATIONSHIP IS AGAIN THAT WITH </p><p>LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>8.  SECOND, SUDAN\'S ARAB RELATIONSHIPS, LARGELY </p><p>UNILATERAL IN TERMS OF TANGIBLE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY </p><p>BENEFITS, CLEARLY ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO SUDAN THAN TO ITS </p><p>PARTNERS.  A HIERARCHY EXISTS AMONG THESE RELATIONSHIPS. </p><p>ON THE PERIPHERY, WITH MINIMAL TIES TO SUDAN, ARE THE </p><p>MAHGREB STATES (MOROCCO, ALGERIA, TUNISIA), PEOPLES OF </p><p>THE LEVANT (LEBANESE, SYRIANS, PALESTINIANS, JORDANIANS) </p><p>AND OTHER NONDONOR AFRICAN COUNTRIES (SOMALIA, DJIBOUTI, </p><p>MAURITANIA).  OF GREATER IMPORTANCE ARE THE SMALL ARABIAN </p><p>PENINSULAR STATES WHERE MANY SUDANESE WORK.  MORE VITAL </p><p>ARE SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA AND IRAQ WHICH ARE PRIME TARGETS </p><p>FOR AID AND EMPLOYMENT.  FINALLY, EGYPT IS IN A CATEGORY </p><p>OF ITS OWN.  A BRIEF SURVEY OF SOME OF THESE </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS FOLLOWS. </p><p> </p><p>EGYPT </p><p> </p><p>9.  SUDAN HAS LONG MAINTAINED A SUBSTANTIAL (THOUGH </p><p>OCCASIONALLY PRICKLY) RELATIONSHIP WITH EGYPT THAT IS </p><p>FIRMLY FOUNDED ON HISTORY AND THE NILE.  COMBINED WITHIN </p><p>OTTOMAN EGYPT AND THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN CONDOMINIUM (AND </p><p>EVEN EARLIER DATING BACK TO CUSHITE PHARAOHS), SUDANESE </p><p>AND EGYPTIANS REFER TO THEMSELVES AS BROTHERS.  BY ITS </p><p>VERY FAMILIARITY AND OBVIOUS ASYMMETRY, THE BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP UNDERGOES PERIODIC STRAINS.  MUTUAL </p><p>INTERESTS AND PERSONAL CONTACTS SO TIGHTLY INTERTWINE </p><p>THIS LINK, HOWEVER, THAT A RUPTURE IS ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE </p><p>TO IMAGINE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE EGYPTIAN-SUDANESE RELATIONSHIP IS FAR DEEPER AND </p><p>MORE MULTI-FACETED THAN MANY REALIZE.  EGYPT\'S PRIMARY </p><p>CONCERN IS STABILITY ON ITS SOUTHERN BORDER AND ENSURING </p><p>ITS WATER SUPPLY.  MEASUREMENT OF NILE WATERS IS AN </p><p>IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF EGYPTIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS.  SUDAN, </p><p>EGYPT AND ETHIOPIA FREQUENTLY DEBATE WATER ALLOCATIONS IN </p><p>BILATERAL SESSIONS AND IN FORMAL MEETINGS OF A NILE WATER </p><p>COMMISSION.  (SUDAN REPORTEDLY USES ONLY ONE QUARTER OF </p><p>ITS ALLOCATION WHILE EGYPT USES TWICE ITS ALLOCATED </p><p>AMOUNT.)  ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST SUCCESSES IN SUDAN THAT </p><p>COULD STIMULATE EGYPT\'S RELIGIOUS RIGHT WORRY THE </p><p>EGYPTIANS ABOVE OTHER POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS.  THERE IS </p><p>NOT, HOWEVER, A STRONG LINK BETWEEN THE NIF AND EGYPT\'S </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND ASSORTED ISLAMIC GAMAA GROUPINGS. </p><p>EGYPTIAN-SUDANESE TIES IN GENERAL ARE SUSTAINED THROUGH A </p><p>VARIETY OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONNECTIONS.  AMONG THEM:  A </p><p>STEADY STREAM OF SUDANESE SHOPPERS, VACATIONERS AND </p><p>JOB-SEEKERS TRAVELLING TO EGYPT (UP TO A MILLION ARE </p><p>BELIEVED TO LIVE THERE); AN OPTIONAL EGYPTIAN SCHOOL </p><p>SYSTEM, ELEMENTARY THROUGH UNIVERSITY, IN SUDAN FUNDED BY </p><p>THE GOE; THE PERVASIVE INFLUENCE OF EGYPTIAN MEDIA AND </p><p>POPULAR CULTURE IN SUDAN; AN ESTIMATED 20,000 SUDANESE </p><p>UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN EGYPT (INCLUDING 1000 SOUTHERNERS </p><p>ON EGYPTIAN SCHOLARSHIPS); STRONG COMMERCIAL AND </p><p>PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; EGYPTIAN DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE, ESPECIALLY IN AGRICULTURE; EGYPTIAN TRAINING </p><p>FOR POLICE, MILITARY OFFICERS AND TRADE UNIONISTS; AND A </p><p>HERITAGE OF EGYPTIAN-SUDANESE MARRIAGES (SADAT\'S MOTHER </p><p>WAS SUDANESE; AHMAD AL-MIRGHANI AND MUBARAK AL-MAHDI\'S </p><p>MOTHERS ARE EGYPTIAN). </p><p> </p><p>11.  DESPITE THEIR CLOSE RELATIONS, EGYPTIANS ADMIT TO </p><p>BEING CONSTANTLY CONFOUNDED BY THEIR UNPREDICTABLE </p><p>SOUTHERN BROTHERS.  SHOCKED IN THE 1950\'S WHEN SUDAN ON </p><p>SHORT NOTICE AND IN A REVERSAL OF POLICY OPTED FOR </p><p>INDEPENDENCE RATHER THAN UNION, THE EGYPTIANS HAVE SINCE </p><p>TRIED, OFTEN UNSUCCESSFULLY, TO GUIDE SUDANESE POLICIES </p><p>WITHOUT SEEMING OVERBEARING.  MANY EGYPTIANS PRIVATELY </p><p>ADMIT TO VIEWING SUDANESE AS INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR. </p><p>BUT THEY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO DEAL CAREFULLY WITH </p><p>SUDANESE WHO ARE HYPERSENSITIVE TO PERCEIVED EGYPTIAN </p><p>INSULTS TO THEIR DIGNITY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  BY CONTRAST, MOST SUDANESE ARE CYNICAL AND DUBIOUS </p><p>ABOUT EGYPTIAN MOTIVES.  MANY ARE CONVINCED THAT THE </p><p>EGYPTIANS HAVE NOT DISCARDED PLANS TO UNITE WITH AND </p><p>CONTROL SUDAN.  (ONLY A FEW SUDANESE DINOSAURS BELONGING </p><p>TO THE OLD NATIONAL UNIONIST PARTY STILL SUPPORT THIS </p><p>ONCE POPULAR DREAM.)  THE BUILDING OF THE ASWAN DAM, </p><p>WHICH FORCED THE RELOCATION OF NORTHERN SUDANESE </p><p>RESIDENTS OF WADI HALFA, AND THE UNCOMPLETED JONGOLAI </p><p>CANAL, BELIEVED BY SOUTHERNERS TO BE AN EGYPTIAN PLOT TO </p><p>DIVERT NILE WATERS FOR ITS BENEFIT, STILL AROUSES </p><p>RESENTMENT.  THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT THE UBIQUITOUS EGYPTIAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.  IN EXPLAINING THEIR ATTITUDES, </p><p>SUDANESE WILL OFTEN DRAW DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN SUDANESE </p><p>AND EGYPTIAN PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER TRAITS.  EGYPTIANS </p><p>COMMONLY ARE SAID TO BE CAREFREE, HUMOROUS, DECEPTIVE AND </p><p>MACHIEVILLIAN, AND COMFORTABLE WITH AUTHORITARIAN RULE </p><p>WHILE THE SUDANESE DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS SERIOUS, </p><p>INTROVERTED, HONEST, DIRECT AND POLITICALLY LIBERTARIAN. </p><p> </p><p>13.  SUDANESE WILL USUALLY SAY THAT EGYPTIANS EVOKE </p><p>BITTERSWEET FEELINGS.  MOST SUDANESE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT </p><p>THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH EGYPTIANS AND THAT EGYPT IS </p><p>THEIR MOST INTIMATE AND IMPORTANT NEIGHBOR.  ON </p><p>PRACTICALLY ANY POLITICAL ISSUE--E.G. AN ALTERNATIVE TO </p><p>SHARIA, LIBYAN INTEGRATION, HANGING OF CURRENCY </p><p>VIOLATORS--THE FIRST SUDANESE REACTION IS TO WONDER ABOUT </p><p>EGYPT\'S REACTION.  DEEP DOWN, SUDANESE, EVEN MOST UMMA </p><p>PARTY ADHERENTS, ADMIT TO THE EXPECTATION, IF NOT </p><p>APPRECIATION, OF EGYPTIAN GUIDANCE AND PROTECTION.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, REFLECTING THE CLASSIC LOVE/HATE EMOTIONS </p><p>OF A SUBORDINATE TOWARD HIS MORE POWERFUL GUARDIAN, </p><p>SUDANESE ENJOY NOTHING BETTER THAN TO BAIT EGYPTIANS AND </p><p>WATCH THEM PUBLICLY HUMILIATED.  A DISPUTED FOUL IN A </p><p>FOOTBALL MATCH IN KHARTOUM BETWEEN SUDAN AND EGYPT ALMOST </p><p>STARTED A RIOT IN EARLY 1989.  MOST SUDANESE </p><p>ENTHUSIASTICALLY CHEERED FOR ALGERIA (AS THEY WILL FOR </p><p>ANY OPPONENT OF EGYPT) IN ALGERIA\'S RECENT WORLD CUP </p><p>MATCHES WITH EGYPT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE RESULT OF THE JUNE 30 COUP WAS A SURPRISE TO THE </p><p>EGYPTIANS THOUGH, AT THE TIME, THE GOE CERTAINLY WELCOMED </p><p>AND ENCOURAGED CHANGE MORE THAN ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT, AS </p><p>A RESULT OF ITS ROCKY RELATIONSHIP WITH SADIQ AL-MAHDI </p><p>AND HIS EGYPTOPHOBIC UMMA COLLEAGUES.  GENERAL OMAR </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED THE SHIFT IN POLICY BY INVITING EGYPTIAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR SHERBINI FOR DISCUSSIONS SOON AFTER THE COUP </p><p>AND MAKING CAIRO HIS FIRST FOREIGN CALL (IN CONTRAST TO </p><p>SADIQ WHO DELIBERATELY SNUBBED EGYPT AND TRAVELLED WIDELY </p><p>BEFORE VISITING EGYPT.)  WITH UNAPOLOGETIC DECLARATIONS </p><p>OF SUPPORT FOR THE GOE, THE RCC SOLICITED ADVICE OF </p><p>PRESIDENT MUBARAK AND AMBASSADOR SHERBINI.  THE </p><p>BLANDISHMENTS AND THE POLITICAL TURNAROUND IN THE GOS </p><p>POSTURE TOWARD EGYPT HAD THEIR DESIRED EFFECT, WITH THE </p><p>GOE SENDING EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AND ENCOURAGING </p><p>DONATIONS FROM ITS WEALTHIER MODERATE ARAB FRIENDS. </p><p>MUBARAK AND THE EGYPTIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE </p><p>(TRADITIONAL LEADING PLAYERS INVOLVING SUDAN) CLEARLY </p><p>WANTED TO BELIEVE IN GENERAL OMAR.  MOUNTING EVIDENCE OF </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST LEANINGS, UNPOPULARITY, AND INCOMPETENCY </p><p>WERE DISCOUNTED, EVENTUALLY LEADING IN LATE 1989 TO AN </p><p>EGYPTIAN SPLIT IN PERCEPTIONS OF SUDAN BETWEEN SENIOR </p><p>INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS AND A LESS SANGUINE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY.  THIS SPLIT QUICKLY BECAME A HOT TOPIC OF </p><p>SUDANESE POLITICAL CONVERSATION.  WHILE BIFURCATED GOE </p><p>VIEWS OF SUDAN APPARENTLY REMAIN, SUDANESE ARGUE THAT GOE </p><p>DISCONTENT WITH EVENTS IN SUDAN HAVE WIDENED AND DEEPENED </p><p>AS THE GOS HAS WARMED TO LIBYA AND FAILED TO MAKE PEACE </p><p>WITH THE SPLA.  MOST BELIEVE THAT THE GOE HAS RETREATED </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ITS EARLY SUPPORT OF THE RCC AND THAT </p><p>FROSTIER BILATERAL RELATIONS, AND EVEN COUP PLOTTING, </p><p>REMINISCENT OF A YEAR AGO ARE IN THE OFFING. </p><p> </p><p>15.  ALTHOUGH SUDANESE SHOP FOR CONSUMER GOODS IN CAIRO </p><p>AND MOST LOCAL MERCHANTS (INCLUDING MANY COPTS) MAINTAIN </p><p>TIES TO EGYPTIAN COMPANIES, EGYPT IS NOT SUDAN\'S TOP </p><p>TRADING PARTNER.  OFFICIAL TRADE HAS BEEN GOVERNED BY </p><p>SPECIAL TRADE PROTOCOLS THAT PROVIDES BARTER AND SPECIAL </p><p>ACCOUNTING MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH THE NONCONVERTIBLE </p><p>CURRENCIES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES.  THESE PROTOCOLS, </p><p>LARGELY ILLUSORY (TRADE GOES ON REGARDLESS) WITH FANCIFUL </p><p>PROJECTED AMOUNTS--USDOLS 360 MILLION IN THE 1989 </p><p>PROTOCOL--AND AN OVERVALUED SUDANESE POUND IN RELATION TO </p><p>THE EGYPTIAN POUND, HAVE BROKEN DOWN REGULARLY WITH </p><p>MUTUAL CHARGES OF AN UNFAIR SURPLUS AND FAILURE TO LIVE </p><p>UP TO THE ACCORD.  IN 1989, THE GOVERNMENT OF SADIQ </p><p>AL-MAHDI ABROGATED THE PROTOCOL AND RESORTED BRIEFLY TO </p><p>TIGHT RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE AND BORDER TRAFFIC (NUBIANS </p><p>IN NORTHERN SUDAN TRADITIONALLY HAVE FLOATED BETWEEN </p><p>BORDERS).  WITH FRIENDLIER BILATERAL TIES AFTER THE COUP, </p><p>ANOTHER LUCRATIVE PROTOCOL WAS NEGOTIATED.  KEY PROBLEMS </p><p>WITH THE PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN SMUGGLING, ESPECIALLY OF </p><p>SUDANESE CAMELS BYPASSING EGYPTIAN CUSTOMS OFFICIALS, AND </p><p>A COMPLICATED MULTIPLE EXCHANGE RATE REGIME THAT DIFFERS </p><p>ACCORDING TO VARIOUS COMMODITIES.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>LATEST STATISTICS, SUDAN EXPORTED 26,607,000 SUDANESE </p><p>POUNDS (USDOLS 2,216,000 BASED ON CURRENT COMMERCIAL </p><p>EXCHANGE RATE) WORTH OF GOODS TO EGYPT IN THE FIRST HALF </p><p>OF 1989--PRIMARILY SESAME, WATERMELON SEEDS AND CAMELS. </p><p>CAMELS CONSTITUTE THE BULK OF EXPORTS.  (THE 1989 </p><p>PROTOCOL ASSIGNED A VALUE OF USDOLS 120 MILLION FOR CAMEL </p><p>EXPORTS; LITTLE OF THE CAMEL TRADE FLOWS THROUGH OFFICIAL </p><p>CHANNELS.)  DURING THE SAME PERIOD, IMPORTS FROM EGYPT </p><p>TOTALED 113,081,000 SUDANESE POUNDS (USDOLS 9,423,000), </p><p>CONCENTRATED IN TEXTILES AND OTHER MANUFACTURED GOODS. </p><p>THE TEMPORARY RUPTURE IN THE PROTOCOL FAILED TO PUT A </p><p>DENT INTO TRADE PATTERNS.  TOTAL OFFICIAL EGYPTIAN TRADE </p><p>(IMPORTS AND EXPORTS) FOR ALL OF 1988 AMOUNTED TO 161 </p><p>MILLION POUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>16.  PLEADING POVERTY AND A NEED TO APPEAR EVENHANDED IN </p><p>SUDAN\'S CIVIL WAR, EGYPT HAS PROVIDED LITTLE MILITARY </p><p>ASSISTANCE, MUCH TO THE SUDANESE ARMY\'S CHAGRIN.  A </p><p>MILITARY AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN SUDAN AND EGYPT.  A </p><p>DEFENSE TREATY SIGNED BY NIMEIRI WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A </p><p>WEAK "BROTHERHOOD CHARTER" UNDER SADIQ AL-MAHDI.  EVEN </p><p>THIS WAS REPEALED IN 1989 AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE SPLA. </p><p>AFTER THE COUP HOWEVER, THE GOS ANNOUNCED THAT THE </p><p>MILITARY DEFENSE TREATY HAD NEVER BEEN ABROGATED AND THUS </p><p>REMAINED IN EFFECT.  THE GOE, INDIFFERENT TO WHETHER A </p><p>TREATY EXISTS OR NOT, HAS SHOWN RELATIVELY LITTLE </p><p>INTEREST IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR.  EGYPT\'S BIGGEST INFLUENCE </p><p>WITH THE SUDANESE MILITARY HAS BEEN THROUGH ITS TRAINING </p><p>PROGRAMS, RANGING FROM BASIC LEVELS TO NASSER HIGHER WAR </p><p>COLLEGE.  SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND </p><p>COUNCIL (RCC) RECEIVED TRAINING IN EGYPT, WHICH REMAINS </p><p>SUDAN\'S CENTER OF FOREIGN MILITARY TRAINING.  MOST </p><p>SUDANESE OFFICERS ARE SYMPATHETIC TO EGYPTIANS, THOUGH </p><p>THEY CHAFE AT THE LACK OF MATERIAL HELP.  SMALL AMOUNTS </p><p>OF MILITARY AID RECENTLY PROVIDED HAVE BEEN NONLETHAL </p><p>SUCH AS UNIFORMS AND PARACHUTES.  SUDANESE ARE QUICK TO </p><p>REMIND THE EGYPTIANS THAT SUDANESE BRIGADES FOUGHT SIDE </p><p>BY SIDE WITH THE EGYPTIANS DURING ALL THE ARAB-ISRAELI </p><p>WARS. </p><p> </p><p>LIBYA </p><p> </p><p>17.  AN INTEGRATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN SUDAN AND LIBYA </p><p>ABRUPTLY ANNOUNCED IN EARLY MARCH 1990 PROPOSING TO </p><p>COMBINE THE TWO COUNTRIES\' POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, MILITARY, </p><p>AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS WITHIN FOUR YEARS CULMINATED A STEADY </p><p>WARMING TREND IN THE RCC\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH TRIPOLI.  A </p><p>RECURRING PHENOMENON TO LURE COLONEL QADHAFI\'S FAVOR, THE </p><p>UNITY PACKAGE LARGELY REGURGITATED OLD IDEAS INCORPORATED </p><p>MOST RECENTLY IN AN ABORTED UNITY PLAN MOOTED IN 1988. </p><p>DESPITE ORNATE RHETORIC, MULTIPLE OFFICIAL VISITS, AND A </p><p>CONFERENCE DEVOTED TO PROMOTING UNITY, FEW SUDANESE </p><p>SERIOUSLY BELIEVE IT WILL SUCCEED.  THUS, CONFIDENT THAT </p><p>UNITY WILL UNGLUE BEFORE IT MATERIALIZES, PUBLIC </p><p>OPPOSITION TO INTEGRATION IS LIMITED, THOUGH SENIOR ARMY </p><p>OFFICERS REPORTEDLY HAVE VOICED DISSATISFACTION. </p><p>RIDICULE IS THE MORE COMMON REACTION.  AWARE OF THE </p><p>DERISION, THE GOS HAS TRIED TO PORTRAY THE ACCORD AS A </p><p>STEP TOWARD PAN-ARAB UNITY, A MORE PALATABLE IF EQUALLY </p><p>UNLIKELY NOTION.  THE UNITY SCHEME, SO LONG AS IT IS </p><p>UNREALIZED ALSO HAS ITS SUPPORTERS.  MANY SUDANESE </p><p>ACCEPT LIBYAN AID AS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY AND WELL WORTH </p><p>HOLLOW RHETORIC AND QUIXOTIC UNITY SCHEMES.  SUDANESE </p><p>MOSTLY LOOK UPON LIBYANS AS DUNDERHEADS AND QADHAFI AS </p><p>ECCENTRIC BUT NOT A REAL THREAT TO SUDAN.  "MILK THEM </p><p>WHILE YOU CAN" IS A POPULAR SENTIMENT. </p><p> </p><p>18.  TO BE SURE, SUDANESE SECURITY AUTHORITIES, MINDFUL </p><p>OF LIBYAN MISCHIEF, HAVE GENERALLY TRIED TO KEEP CLOSE </p><p>TABS ON LIBYAN ACTIVITIES AND MOVEMENTS IN AND NEAR </p><p>KHARTOUM.  THE RECENT ABOLITION OF VISAS FOR LIBYANS (AND </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY ALL ARABS) COMPLICATES THEIR JOB, THOUGH </p><p>SECURITY OFFICERS AT THE AIRPORT REPORTEDLY ARE PAYING </p><p>SPECIAL ATTENTION TO LIBYAN VISITORS WHEN THEY PASS </p><p>THROUGH NORMAL IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS PROCEDURES. </p><p>CYNICS RECKON THERE IS LITTLE LEFT TO SABOTAGE IN SUDAN. </p><p>LACKLUSTER LIBYAN-BACKED REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES IN </p><p>SUDAN, RECOGNIZED AS A "POLITICAL PARTY" BEFORE THE COUP, </p><p>DISBANDED WITH THE ABOLITION OF PARTIES, AND, ACCORDING </p><p>TO SEVERAL SUDANESE, HAVE REMAINED INACTIVE.  LIBYANS </p><p>APPEAR TO BE FOCUSING INSTEAD ON LINKING THEIR POPULAR </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS WITH SUDAN\'S LOCALLY-BASED, AND </p><p>INCREASINGLY ACTIVE PEOPLES\' COMMITTEES AND POPULAR </p><p>DEFENSE FORCES.  AS FOR LIBYAN TRANSGRESSIONS IN DARFUR, </p><p>WHILE SOME SUDANESE PROFESS TO BE TROUBLED BY THE AFFRONT </p><p>TO SUDAN\'S SOVEREIGNTY, THE MAJORITY SEEM CONTENT TO TURN </p><p>A BLIND EYE TO EVENTS IN A REMOTE AREA. </p><p> </p><p>19.  LIBYA\'S MAIN ECONOMIC ATTRACTION IS CHEAP OIL BUT </p><p>SUDAN HAS LITTLE OF VALUE TO OFFER IN RETURN.  DEPRIVED </p><p>OF REGULAR SUPPLIES FROM KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA, DUE TO </p><p>NONPAYMENT AND RCC POLITICS, SUDAN RECENTLY HAS HAD TO </p><p>RELY ALMOST COMPLETELY ON LIBYAN OIL.  THE CURRENT DEAL </p><p>FOR LIBYAN OIL REQUIRES SUDAN TO PAY ONLY FOR INTEREST ON </p><p>THE PURCHASE WITH THE PRINCIPAL TO BE PAID IN KIND WITH </p><p>FUTURE SUDANESE OIL PRODUCTION.  DESPITE WELL-PUBLICIZED </p><p>AGREEMENTS WITH LIBYA, SHIPMENTS OF LIBYAN OIL HAVE BEEN </p><p>ERRATIC.  LIBYA\'S PROMISED 50,000 METRIC TONS OF OIL PER </p><p>MONTH TO SADIQ\'S GOVERNMENT AND THE RCC HAS NOT ALWAYS </p><p>ARRIVED.  FOLLOWING THE MARCH 1990 INTEGRATION ACCORD, </p><p>LIBYA PLEDGED TO DOUBLE ITS SUDANESE OIL SHIPMENTS TO </p><p>100,000 METRIC TONS FOR BOTH APRIL AND MAY. </p><p> </p><p>20.  SUDAN\'S BALANCE OF TRADE WITH LIBYA HAS BEEN </p><p>ENTIRELY NEGATIVE ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT FIGURES.  FOR </p><p>THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 1989, LIBYA RECEIVED NO SUDANESE </p><p>EXPORTS WHILE SUDAN IMPORTED 269,712,000 POUNDS (USDOLS </p><p>22,500,000) OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS FROM LIBYA.  LIBYA HAS </p><p>FOCUSED INSTEAD ON OBTAINING POLITICAL DIVIDENDS FROM </p><p>TRADE.  THIS WAS DRAMATICALLY REFLECTED IN THE 1989 </p><p>KHARTOUM TRADE FAIR WHEN LIBYA\'S BOOTH WAS CONFINED TO </p><p>ANTI-AMERICAN SLOGANS AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF ALLEGED </p><p>CASUALTIES FROM U.S. BOMBING OF TRIPOLI.  (THE U.S. </p><p>PULLED OUT WHEN THE GOS FAILED TO ACT ON AMERICAN </p><p>PROTESTS.)  IN DECEMBER 1989, SUDAN AND LIBYA APPROVED A </p><p>USDOLS 50 MILLION COMMERCIAL PROTOCOL PLEDGING THE EXPORT </p><p>OF SUDANESE GOATS, OIL SEEDS, PERFUME AND TEXTILES IN </p><p>RETURN FOR OIL, FERTILIZERS AND CEMENT.  AS WITH THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN PROTOCOL, THE ACCORD IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR ITS </p><p>POLITICAL DIMENSIONS RATHER THAN AS A GUIDE TO ACTUAL </p><p>TRADE.  A BILATERAL PROTOCOL IN AGRICULTURAL COOPERATION </p><p>WAS SIGNED IN FEBRUARY 1990 AIMED AT LIBYAN BANKROLLING </p><p>CEREAL AND MEAT PRODUCTION FACILITIES.  LIBYAN </p><p>AGRICULTURAL ASSISTANCE ALSO HAS MORE POLITICAL THAN </p><p>ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE; A LIBYAN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT </p><p>SCHEME IN DARFUR IS WIDELY VIEWED AS A FRONT FOR ARMS </p><p>SMUGGLING AND OTHER NONAGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>21.  SUDAN AND LIBYA RECENTLY RESURRECTED THE IDEA OF A </p><p>JOINT INVESTMENT BANK CAPITALIZED AT USDOLS 50 MILLION </p><p>AND HAVE DISCUSSED IMPROVEMENT OF COMMUNICATION AND </p><p>TRANSPORT SERVICES BETWEEN THEIR COUNTRIES.  AS IN THE </p><p>CASE OF OIL SHIPMENTS HOWEVER, LIBYAN PROMISES OF </p><p>ECONOMIC HELP FOR ECONOMIC PROJECTS HAVE HAD A HABIT OF </p><p>NOT MATERIALIZING.  LIBYA PROVIDES A MODEST NUMBER OF </p><p>JOBS FOR SUDANESE--ABOUT 2000 SUDANESE RESIDE IN LIBYA </p><p>BESIDES SEASONAL MIGRATION OF SUDANESE TRIBES FROM DARFUR </p><p>INTO KUFRA.  A SUDANESE ESTIMATED THAT 2000-3000 DARFUR </p><p>TRIBESMEN WORK WITHOUT PERMITS IN KUFRA. </p><p> </p><p>22.  LIBYA, ONCE A BACKER OF THE SPLA, IS NOW SUDAN\'S </p><p>MOST DEPENDABLE MILITARY SUPPLIER.  THE SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>SUPPLY RELATIONSHIP EXISTS EITHER BASED ON SECRET PACTS </p><p>AS ALLEGED BY THE SPLA OR, MORE LIKELY, BASED ON INFORMAL </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED BY SADIQ AL-MAHDI\'S MINIONS AND </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY RENEWED BY THE RCC.  A FORMAL MILITARY </p><p>PROTOCOL SIGNED BY THE GOS SHORTLY AFTER PRESIDENT </p><p>NIMEIRI\'S OUSTER WAS NOT OPEN-ENDED AND REFERRED ONLY TO </p><p>A SPECIFIC LIST OF ITEMS.  BY WHATEVER RATIONALE, THE </p><p>LIBYANS HAVE LOANED OR DONATED IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS </p><p>MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MILITARY PROVISIONS RANGING FROM </p><p>AMMUNITION TO MIG-23 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT.  DOLLAR FIGURES </p><p>ARE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE, BUT THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THIS </p><p>AID HAS BEEN A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN PROPPING UP THE SUDANESE </p><p>ARMY IN ITS CONFLICT WITH THE SPLA.  SINCE THE COUP, </p><p>LIBYA HAS DISPATCHED TWICE WEEKLY TO SUDAN AN IL-76 </p><p>TRANSPORT PLANE LADEN WITH SUPPLIES, BELIEVED EXCLUSIVELY </p><p>FOR MILITARY USE.  IN ADDITION, LIBYA HAS PROVIDED </p><p>TRAINING, ADVISORS AND PILOTS, THOUGH LIBYA\'S DIRECT </p><p>INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MILITARY IN SUDAN HAS BEEN DENIED BY </p><p>THE GOS.  LIBYAN MILITARY, HOWEVER, ARE PERIODICALLY SEEN </p><p>AT KHARTOUM HOTELS AND MILITARY FACILITIES.  LIBYA\'S </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN BOMBING RAIDS WAS PROVEN WHEN THE SPLA </p><p>PRODUCED A LIBYAN PILOT AFTER DOWNING A MIG AIRCRAFT IN </p><p>1989.  THE GOS STILL DENIED IT.  LIBYAN PILOTS SEEM TO </p><p>OPERATE AUTONOMOUSLY, WITH THE TACIT BACKING OF THE </p><p>SUDANESE MILITARY BRASS. </p><p> </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA </p><p> </p><p>23.  WHILE SHUNNING THE SPOTLIGHT, SAUDI ARABIA, MORE </p><p>THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY, PLAYS A CRITICAL ECONOMIC ROLE IN </p><p>BOLSTERING SUDAN THROUGH LARGE-SCALE REMITTANCE-PRODUCING </p><p>EMPLOYMENT, DIRECT GOVERNMENT AID, TRADE AND PRIVATE </p><p>INVESTMENT.  WITH AN ESTIMATED 350,000 SUDANESE </p><p>DOCUMENTED EXPATRIATE WORKERS (PLUS ANOTHER 150,000 OR SO </p><p>WHO NEVER RETURNED FROM HAJ), SAUDI ARABIA PROVIDES THE </p><p>LARGEST SHARE OF REMITTANCES.  BECAUSE THE BULK OF </p><p>REMITTANCES HAVE COME TO SUDAN THROUGH UNOFFICIAL </p><p>CHANNELS, THEY HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY IN 1985, TOTAL REMITTANCES </p><p>AMOUNTED TO USDOLS 2.9 BILLION, ONE-THIRD OF SUDAN\'S </p><p>GNP.  OFFICIAL EXPATRIATE REMITTANCES IN 1988 TOTALED </p><p>USDOLS 445 MILLION WHICH CONSTITUTED 78 PERCENT OF </p><p>SUDAN\'S HARD CURRENCY BUDGET.  SINCE THE COUP HOWEVER, </p><p>NOT ONLY HAS OFFICIAL REMITTANCES DECLINED TO AN ANNUAL </p><p>0ARGET OF USDOLS 300 MILLION (AND PROBABLY MUCH LESS), </p><p>BUT UNOFFICIAL REMITTANCES, PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED PRIVATE </p><p>INVESTMENT, ALSO HAVE DRIED UP IN THE FACE OF THE </p><p>ANTI-CORRUPTION ZEAL OF THE RCC.  EXPATRIATES HAVE </p><p>PREFERRED TO KEEP THEIR SAVINGS IN FOREIGN ACCOUNTS WHICH </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES USE WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE </p><p>OF SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>24.  WITH ITS RELATIVELY HIGH SALARIES, SAUDI ARABIA IS </p><p>THE FAVORED DESTINATION FOR AMBITIOUS AND ENTERPRISING </p><p>SUDANESE.  THRONGS OF VISA APPLICANTS CAN ALWAYS BE SEEN </p><p>OUTSIDE THE SAUDI EMBASSY IN KHARTOUM DURING WORKING </p><p>HOURS.  SUDANESE WORKERS IN SAUDI ARABIA RANGE FROM </p><p>PROFESSIONALS (TWO-THIRDS OF SUDANESE DOCTORS ARE </p><p>OVERSEAS) TO MANUAL LABORERS.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>PROVIDED IRREGULAR DOSES OF AID, MOST RECENTLY RELEASING </p><p>207 MILLION RIYALS (USDOLS 55.2 MILLION) TO REBUILD THE </p><p>ROAD FROM KHARTOUM TO PORT SUDAN.  THE SAUDIS HAVE </p><p>GENERALLY AVOIDED MILITARY ASSISTANCE.  THEY RECENTLY </p><p>TURNED DOWN, FOR EXAMPLE, GOS REQUESTS FOR SMALL NAVAL </p><p>CRAFT FOR ANTISMUGGLING PATROLS ON THE RED SEA.  THEY </p><p>REPORTEDLY FINANCED, HOWEVER, THE SUDANESE PURCHASE FROM </p><p>CHINA IN 1989 OF 40 TANKS AND 40 ARMORED PERSONNEL </p><p>CARRIERS (APC\'S), ALONG WITH FIELD AND ANTIAIRCRAFT </p><p>ARTILLERY AND SMALL ARMS.  THE SAUDI MONETARY FUND AND </p><p>SAUDI FUND FOR DEVELOPMENT HAVE FUNDED NUMEROUS ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS INCLUDING ABOUT FIFTY THAT ARE </p><p>ONGOING.  REHABILITATION OF THE GEZIRA AGRICULTURAL </p><p>SCHEME AND A NEW AIRPORT IN PORT SUDAN ARE EXAMPLES OF </p><p>MAJOR PROJECTS UNDERWAY.  ACCORDING TO 1988 FIGURES, </p><p>SAUDI AGENCIES HAD OVER USDOLS 1.2 BILLION IN OUTSTANDING </p><p>LOANS TO SUDAN, BY FAR THE LARGEST LOAN COMMITMENT OF ANY </p><p>NATION.  REPORTEDLY, SAUDI WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE AID HAS </p><p>LANGUISHED RECENTLY BECAUSE OF SAUDI DISMAY WITH RCC </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>25.  OFFICIAL TRADE FIGURES CONFIRM THAT SAUDI ARABIA IS </p><p>SUDAN\'S LARGEST TRADE PARTNER.  FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS </p><p>OF 1989, SUDANESE EXPORTS--LARGELY LIVESTOCK (CAMELS AND </p><p>GOATS), SESAME SEEDS AND SORGHUM--TOTALED 276,624,000 </p><p>POUNDS (USDOLS 22,674,000) AND IMPORTS--PETROLEUM </p><p>PRODUCTS AND TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT--CAME TO </p><p>316,627,000 POUNDS (USDOLS 25,953,000).  SAUDIS HAVE ALSO </p><p>BEEN IMPORTANT PRIVATE INVESTORS IN SUDAN, INCLUDING </p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD AL FAISAL (FAISAL ISLAMIC BANK), SHEIKH </p><p>MAHFOUZ SALEM BIN MAHFOUZ (SAUDI-SUDANESE BANK), SHEIKH </p><p>ABDEL LATIF GHORAB (DALLAH AL-BARAKA GROUP), SHEIKH OMER </p><p>BIN LADEN (BIN LADEN COMPANIES) AND IBRAHIM AL-AFFANDI. </p><p>ALTHOUGH SAUDI INVESTORS HAVE BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY COURTED BY </p><p>THE RCC PRIVATELY AND AT THE RECENT INVESTMENT </p><p>CONFERENCE, BUSINESSMEN REPORT THAT SAUDIS AND OTHER ARAB </p><p>INVESTORS HAVE EXHIBITED A MARKED RELUCTANCE TO RISK </p><p>THEIR FUNDS IN SUDAN.  SAUDI PRIVATE INVESTMENT SEEMS TO </p><p>BE SHRINKING RATHER THAN EXPANDING. </p><p> </p><p>26.  SUDAN\'S LINKS TO SAUDI ARABIA ARE BOTH STRENGTHENED </p><p>AND WEAKENED BY ISLAMIC CONNECTIONS.  ALL BUT THE MOST </p><p>SECULAR OF SUDANESE MUSLIMS PARTICIPATE AT LEAST ONCE IN </p><p>THE HAJ, THE PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA.  SAUDI ARABIA ALSO </p><p>CONTRIBUTES SUBSTANTIALLY TO ISLAMIC ORGANIZATIONS IN </p><p>SUDAN INCLUDING AN ISLAMIC INSTITUTE IN KHARTOUM. </p><p>PARADOXICALLY, SUDAN\'S RELIGIOUS TENDENCIES ARE AMONG THE </p><p>ELEMENTS THAT MOST DISCONCERT THE SAUDIS.  RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERS OF THE PURIST WAHABI SECT IN SAUDI ARABIA FROWN </p><p>ON MYSTICAL MUSLIM PRACTICES COMMON IN SUDAN INCLUDING </p><p>VENERATION OF SAINTLY FOREFATHERS, CONSULTATIONS WITH </p><p>LIVING FAKIS (HOLY MEN) AND MAGICAL (FORTUNE TELLING, </p><p>HEALING) FORMS OF FOLK RELIGION.  POLITICALLY, THE SAUDIS </p><p>DISDAIN ISLAMIC COMPETITION ARISING FROM SUFI SECTS AND </p><p>THE INDIGENOUS NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT.  BECAUSE ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM HAS OFTEN INCLUDED AN ANTI-SAUDI STRAIN, </p><p>THEY REPORTEDLY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH MILITANT </p><p>PROCLIVITIES, INCLUDING IRANIAN SYMPATHIES, APPARENT IN </p><p>SOME SUDANESE OFFICIALS.  THIS ALSO REFLECTS LACK OF </p><p>SAUDI ENTHUSIASM FOR SUPPORTING ANY ARAB COUNTRY WHICH </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO FOLLOW A STRICTER FORM OF ISLAM THAN THAT OF </p><p>THE KEEPER OF THE HOLY CITIES.  SAUDIS ARE ALSO SAID TO </p><p>BE DISTRESSED AT THE FUROR IN SUDAN OVER THE HUDUD, WHICH </p><p>DRAWS UNWANTED ATTENTION TO SAUDI APPLICATION OF SHARIA </p><p>LAW.  SAUDIS, DISTINGUISHING THEIR HOMOGENOUS MUSLIM </p><p>NATION FROM A MIXED RELIGIOUS SOCIETY LIKE SUDAN, WOULD </p><p>PREFER THAT SUDAN COMPROMISE ON SHARIA TO PRODUCE PEACE, </p><p>RELIGIOUS HARMONY AND STABILITY.  SUDAN\'S ASSOCIATIONS </p><p>WITH RADICAL LIBYA ONLY AGGRAVATE SAUDI DISCOMFORT WITH </p><p>SUDAN, A DISCOMFORT THAT HAS ALREADY DIMINISHED SAUDI </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>27.  THE EARLY LOVEFEST BETWEEN THE RCC AND SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN, MUCH OF IT COUCHED IN SECRECY, SEEMS SOMETHING </p><p>OF AN ANAMOLY, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN WHY IT HAS NOW COOLED </p><p>SOMEWHAT.  SADDAM, AFTER ALL, RULES A SECULAR STATE WARY </p><p>OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS (AN IRAQI DISSIDENT BELONGING </p><p>TO AL-DAWA WAS MURDERED IN 1988 BY THE IRAQIS IN THE </p><p>LOBBY OF KHARTOUM\'S HILTON HOTEL), WHILE THE RCC, BACKED </p><p>BY THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT, HAS PURGED AND ARRESTED </p><p>HUNDREDS OF SUDANESE SECULARISTS.  VISITS BY RCC MEMBERS </p><p>OMAR AL-BASHIR AND MOHAMMAD AL-KHALIFA, HOWEVER, WERE </p><p>WARMLY RECEIVED BY SADDAM AND GOS APPEALS FOR MILITARY </p><p>ASSISTANCE, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE SPLA TOOK KURMUK, WERE </p><p>GENEROUSLY REWARDED WITH TWO SOVIET AN-12 AIRCRAFT, AND </p><p>SHIPMENTS OF AMMUNITION AND SMALL ARMS.  A NUMBER OF </p><p>THEORIES HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BY SUDANESE TO EXPLAIN </p><p>SADDAM\'S FRIENDLINESS.  CERTAINLY SADDAM, LIKE MUBARAK, </p><p>DESPISED SADIQ AL-MAHDI, WHO FLIRTED WITH THE IRANIANS, </p><p>AND THUS HAD REASON TO WELCOME HIS REPLACEMENT.  SADDAM </p><p>ALSO MAY HAVE FELT AN AFFINITY TO A GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>SOLDIERS, CERTAINLY MORE SO THAN TO THE FREEWHEELING </p><p>DEMOCRACY THAT PRECEDED IT.  FURTHERMORE, SADDAM, WITH </p><p>VISIONS OF GRANDEUR AS A PAN-ARAB LEADER AND REELING FROM </p><p>CRITICISM FOR HIS POLICIES IN LEBANON, MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>SUSCEPTIBLE TO GOS BLANDISHMENTS.  FINALLY, SADDAM, </p><p>PERHAPS GRATEFUL FOR THE HELP OF SUDANESE "VOLUNTEERS" </p><p>(TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MANUAL LABORERS IN IRAQ ENLISTED OR </p><p>WERE COERCED IN THE WAR EFFORT) IN THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR AND, </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCE, SYMPATHISED WITH A </p><p>SUDANESE WAR LARGELY AGAINST NONARABS.  ALL OF THE ABOVE </p><p>WERE PROBABLY FACTORS. </p><p> </p><p>28.  SADDAM\'S AMICABLE RELATIONS WITH THE RCC PUT IRAQ\'S </p><p>KEY INSTITUTION IN SUDAN, THE IRAQI BAATHIST PARTY, IN A </p><p>PREDICAMENT.  COMPOSED LARGELY OF SUDANESE STUDENTS WHO </p><p>ONCE STUDIED IN BAGHDAD, THE BAATHIST PARTY, WHICH IS </p><p>SMALL BUT INFLUENTIAL AMONG SUDANESE PROFESSIONALS, </p><p>STAUNCHLY SUPPORTS SECULARIST RULE AND OPPOSES THE NIF. </p><p>BAATHISTS ENJOYED SOMEWHAT OF A GRACE PERIOD FROM </p><p>SECURITY OFFICIALS AFTER THE COUP WITH ARRESTS OF ONLY A </p><p>FEW PARTY LEADERS.  INCLINED TO JOIN THE COMMUNISTS AND </p><p>OTHER SECULARISTS IN OPPOSITION TO THE RCC, PARTY MEMBERS </p><p>WERE TORN BETWEEN LOYALTY TO IRAQ AND SECULARIST </p><p>IDEOLOGY.  IT THUS VACILLATED BEFORE JOINING OTHER </p><p>PARTIES AND UNIONS AND SIGNING AN OPPOSITION CHARTER </p><p>AGAINST THE RCC.  THE UNCERTAINTY WAS EVIDENT AGAIN AT </p><p>THE TIME OF THE DOCTORS STRIKE IN DECEMBER 1989, AS MANY </p><p>BAATHISTS, ESPECIALLY IN LEGAL CIRCLES, WERE SAID TO BE </p><p>RELUCTANT TO GET INVOLVED.  BAATHISTS, ALONG WITH OTHER </p><p>LEFTISTS, WERE ARRESTED IN LARGE NUMBERS AFTER THE </p><p>STRIKE.  AROUND THE SAME TIME, IRAQ SEEMS TO HAVE JOINED </p><p>OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES IN THEIR DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE </p><p>GOS, AND STOPPED SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE.  BAATHIST </p><p>CHAIRMAN TAISEER MUTASSIR RECENTLY TOLD A FELLOW ATTORNEY </p><p>THAT IRAQ PLANNED TO CUT ALL ITS AID TO SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>THE PENINSULAR STATES </p><p> </p><p>29.  FOLLOWING EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA, THE LARGEST NUMBER </p><p>OF EXPATRIATE SUDANESE WORK AND RESIDE IN THE UNITED ARAB </p><p>EMIRATES.  ACCORDING TO ONE SUDANESE ESTIMATE, THERE ARE </p><p>BETWEEN 50,000 AND 100,000 SUDANESE IN THE UAE.  MOST ARE </p><p>MIDDLE CLASS BUSINESSMEN, CIVIL SERVANTS, TEACHERS AND </p><p>PROFESSIONALS.  TWO CURRENT CABINET MINISTERS WERE </p><p>WORKING IN ABU DHABI WHEN THEY WERE PICKED FOR THE </p><p>CABINET.  KAMAL HAMZA, EX-MAYOR OF DUBAI AND NOW </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RULER\'S DIWAN, HEADS A DISTINGUISHED </p><p>SUDANESE COMMUNITY IN DUBAI.  THIS EXPATRIATE PRESENCE </p><p>HAS FOCUSED SOME UAE ATTENTION ON SUDAN.  THE ABU DHABI </p><p>FUND HAD COMMITTED USDOLS 239,580,000 TO SUDANESE </p><p>PROJECTS THROUGH 1988.  SHEIKH ZAYID CONTRIBUTED USDOLS </p><p>35 MILLION TO SUDAN AFTER GENERAL OMAR PAID A VISIT, AND </p><p>THE UAE NAVY REPORTEDLY TRAINS SUDANESE OFFICERS.  THERE </p><p>ARE ALSO SAID TO BE A NUMBER OF SUDANESE IN THE POLICE </p><p>FORCES OF THE VARIOUS EMIRATES.  A RECENT VISITOR TO THE </p><p>UAE, WHO MET A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, REPORTED </p><p>COINSIDERABLE DISMAY OVER SUDAN.  SHEIKH SULTAN OF </p><p>SHARJAH (WHO HAS DONATED CONSIDERABLE MONEY TO THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF KHARTOUM INCLUDING SHARJAH HALL) BLUNTLY </p><p>TOLD THE VISITOR THAT HE AND OTHER OFFICIALS INTENDED TO </p><p>AVOID ASSISTANCE TO THE GOS UNTIL IT "SHAPED UP." </p><p> </p><p>30.  KUWAIT ALSO HAS ATTRACTED SUDANESE PROFESSIONALS, </p><p>THOUGH IN LESS NUMBERS THAN THE UAE--ABOUT 20,000 TO </p><p>30,000.  KUWAIT\'S MAJOR INPUT IN SUDAN HAS BEEN THROUGH </p><p>THE KUWAIT FUND WHICH HAS PROVIDED LARGE AMOUNTS OF AID </p><p>FOR DEVELOPMENT, MOSTLY AGRO-INDUSTRIAL (E.G. KENANA </p><p>SUGAR FACTORY, A MAJOR POULTRY FARM), PROJECTS.  USDOLS </p><p>809,353,000 WAS COMMITTED THROUGH 1988, SECOND ONLY TO </p><p>THE SAUDIS.  KUWAIT HAS UNTIL RECENTLY SUPPLIED OIL. </p><p>SUDANESE OFFICIALS REPORT THAT KUWAITI INTEREST IN SUDAN </p><p>IS ALSO DECLINING.  ECHOING THEIR ARAB COLLEAGUES, </p><p>KUWAITIS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE GOS IS ISOLATING </p><p>ITSELF INTERNATIONALLY AND MAKING LITTLE PROGRESS IN </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>31.  ABOUT FOUR TO SIX THOUSAND SUDANESE, MOSTLY </p><p>TEACHERS, WORK IN OMAN AND NORTH YEMEN.  THESE COUNTRIES </p><p>HAVE PROVIDED LITTLE DIRECT ASSISTANCE, THOUGH OMAN MADE </p><p>A SMALL CONTRIBUTION AFTER A VISIT BY OMAR AL-BASHIR. </p><p>THE SUDANESE HAVE HAD A LENGTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE </p><p>YEMENIS--MANY ATTENDED SCHOOL IN KHARTOUM, OTHERS WORKED </p><p>AS PEDDLERS.  INTERESTINGLY, SUDANESE TEND TO PICK </p><p>YEMENIS, WHO ARE PERCEIVED AS HONEST AND UNPRETENTIOUS, </p><p>AS ARABS WITH WHOM THEY ARE MOST COMFORTABLE.  QATAR, </p><p>ANOTHER DISPLEASED ARAB STATE, REFUSED GENERAL OMAR\'S </p><p>PLEA FOR AID AND REPORTEDLY WANTS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF </p><p>SUDANESE EMPLOYED IN QATAR.  ROUNDING OUT THE PENINSULAR </p><p>STATES, SUDAN HAS LITTLE COMMERCIAL AND NO DIPLOMATIC </p><p>PRESENCE IN BAHRAIN OR ADEN. </p><p> </p><p>PERIPHERY STATES </p><p> </p><p>32.  SUDAN\'S MODEST RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE REMAINING ARAB </p><p>STATES, PERCEIVED AS DISTANT AND UNLIKELY DONORS, RARELY </p><p>CONCERN THE GOS.  EXCEPT FOR A COTERIE OF AMERICAN </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT ALUMINI NOW IN THEIR 40\'S, FEW </p><p>SUDANESE HAVE VENTURED TO THE LEVANT.  LEBANON IS CITED </p><p>IN CONVERSATION ONLY AS A WARNING OF WHAT DECENTRALIZED </p><p>LOYALTIES AND INTOLERANCE MIGHT PRODUCE IN SUDAN.  THE </p><p>ARAB BAR ASSOCIATION\'S ANNUAL MEETING IN 1989 IN DAMASCUS </p><p>WAS THE FIRST VISIT TO SYRIA BY MEMBERS OF THE SUDANESE </p><p>DELEGATION.  SYRIA GIVES NO AID TO SUDAN, THOUGH RELIEF </p><p>ASSISTANCE GIVEN IN 1988 IS DRAWING ATTENTION AS IT IS </p><p>THE BASIS FOR A MISAPPROPIATION AND CORRUPTION CASE </p><p>AGAINST FORMER STATE COUNCIL MEMBER IDRIS AL-BANNA. </p><p>JORDAN HAS DONATED SOME MEDICINE AND SENDS A ROTATING </p><p>MEDICAL TEAM TO WORK IN DARFUR.  THE "PALESTINE </p><p>AMBASSADOR" ACTIVELY BUT NOT TOO SUCCESSFULLY SEEKS TO </p><p>SPARK SUDANESE INTEREST IN THE INTIFADA.  HE HAS BEEN </p><p>GIVEN PERMISSION TO CONSTRUCT A PALESTINE UNIVERSITY IN </p><p>KHARTOUM.  YASSIR ARAFAT\'S OCCASIONAL VISITS ATTRACT </p><p>LITTLE ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>33.  SUDAN ALSO HAS FEW TRADE OR OTHER LINKS WITH THE </p><p>MAHGREB STATES.  MOROCCAN LINKS, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE </p><p>CONFINED TO 60 STUDENTS STUDYING IN MOROCCO AND A PRIVATE </p><p>BANK\'S FINANCING OF AN AGRICULTURE PROJECT.  NONE OF THE </p><p>DIPLOMATS FROM THE MAGHREB SEEM TO PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO </p><p>LOCAL AFFAIRS.  THE SOMALI EMBASSYS ONLY APPARENT </p><p>FUNCTION IN SUDAN IS TO ISSUE REFUGEE DOCUMENTS TO </p><p>ETHIOPIAN REBELS.  MANY SUDANESE ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF </p><p>DJIBOUTI OR MAURITANIA, NEITHER OF WHICH HAVE AN EMBASSY </p><p>IN KHARTOUM. </p><p> </p><p>34.  COMMENT.  SUDAN DELIGHTS IN TRUMPETING ITS ROLE AS A </p><p>BRIDGE BETWEEN AFRICA AND THE ARAB COUNTRIES.  THIS </p><p>COMMENDABLE THOUGH UNATTAINED IDEAL OVERLOOKS A </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM--SUDAN\'S BRIDGES TO BOTH ARABS AND </p><p>AFRICANS ARE IN DISREPAIR.  IRONICALLY WHILE ARAB </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE RCC HAVE GRADUALLY WORSENED UNTIL THEY </p><p>HAVE RETURNED TO, OR EVEN BECOME WORSE THAN, THEIR </p><p>PRE-COUP STATUS, GENERAL OMAR HAS MANAGED, DESPITE </p><p>CONTINUING CONFLICT WITH THE SPLA AND ALLEGATIONS OF NIF </p><p>INFLUENCE, TO REPAIR RELATIONS WITH SOME OF HIS AFRICAN </p><p>NEIGHBORS INCLUDING KENYA, ZAIRE, AND THE C.A.R., DAMAGED </p><p>BY SADIQ. </p><p> </p><p>35.  COMMENT CONTINUED.  WHILE THE SPECTER OF PAN-ARABISM </p><p>WHICH LOOMS IN ANY DISCUSSION OF AN ARAB CONSENSUS IS </p><p>REVILED BY SOUTHERN SUDANESE, BROAD ARAB COLLABORATION </p><p>TODAY, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, IS NOT INIMICAL TO SOUTHERN </p><p>INTERESTS OR TO THOSE OF THE U.S.  WITH THE REGRETTABLE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF LIBYA, ARAB NATIONS WITH CONNECTIONS TO </p><p>SUDAN WANT PEACE, STABILITY AND ECONOMIC REFORM IN </p><p>SUDAN.  THEY RECOGNIZE THE NECESSITY OF, AND THEIR </p><p>LEADERS HAVE ENCOURAGED, COMPROMISE ON SHARIA, ADJUSTMENT </p><p>OF POLICIES TO BROADEN GOS POLITICAL APPEAL, AND </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE IMF FOR REAL ECONOMIC REFORM. </p><p>MENDING ITS ARAB BRIDGES MAY WELL PROVE A KEY TO </p><p>IMPROVING SUDAN\'S FORTUNES. </p><p> </p><p>ONEILL </p><p></p></div>
