<p>UNCLAS FRANKFURT 000682 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: CDU LIKELY TO WIN HESSE ELECTIONS, PERHAPS WITH </p><p>ABSOLUTE MAJORITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) Summary:  Hesse will see a clear victory for </p><p>Minister-President Roland Koch and the governing CDU-FDP </p><p>coalition in state elections February 2.  All major opinion </p><p>polls put the CDU ahead of the SPD by up to 18 percentage </p><p>points.  The dramatic erosion of support for the SPD is </p><p>attributed to continuing voter disillusion with the </p><p>Schroeder government.  On the state level, the SPD\'s </p><p>candidate Gerhard Boekel is seen as too colorless a </p><p>personality to beat Minister-President Koch.  The Hesse SPD </p><p>has started a petition against war in Iraq, led more by </p><p>campaign managers than Boekel.  The Green Party will be a </p><p>secondary winner, gaining four percent.  The FDP will most </p><p>likely make it over the 5 percent threshold to remain in the </p><p>State Parliament.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Opinion Polls Put CDU Significantly Ahead </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) Recent opinion polls predict that the CDU will win, </p><p>possibly with an absolute majority.  The CDU has never </p><p>before won two consecutive elections in Hesse.  Compared to </p><p>its 1999 result (43.4 percent) the CDU may gain three to </p><p>seven percent.  The latter would mean an absolute majority, </p><p>even with four parties represented in the State Parliament </p><p>(Landtag).  This would be almost unprecedented in postwar </p><p>German history.  The CDU could lose is if the FDP does not </p><p>make it over the 5 percent threshold and the CDU fails to </p><p>get an absolute majority.  Major polls by Infratest dimap, </p><p>Forsa and Forschungsgruppe Wahlen predict the possibility of </p><p>this scenario is shrinking. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) The SPD, which received 39.3 percent of the vote </p><p>in 1999, is on a downward trend.  It may lose seven to eight </p><p>percent according to polls.  This would be an unprecedented </p><p>loss.  The Hesse SPD is still in bad shape: it never really </p><p>recovered from its 1999 defeat.  Though its lead candidate </p><p>Gerhard Boekel has increased in popularity, he is often </p><p>described by the media as "colorless" in comparison with </p><p>Koch and not viewed as a strong enough personality to beat </p><p>the Minister-President.  The Greens may win three to four </p><p>percent above their 1999 election result of 7.2 percent, </p><p>largely on the issue of opposition to Frankfurt airport </p><p>expansion.  All polls predict the Green party may get its </p><p>best result ever.  (Note: The Hesse Greens are Foreign </p><p>Minister Fischer\'s home party.)  The FDP will get five </p><p>percent and may even gain one or two percent.  Up to a third </p><p>of voters say they are still undecided, mostly previous SPD </p><p>voters. </p><p> </p><p>The Iraq Issue </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Hesse SPD is using the waning days of the </p><p>campaign to focus on Iraq.  Though Boekel hesitates to use </p><p>the issue aggressively, campaign managers are pushing it. </p><p>The Hesse SPD is collecting signatures at campaign stands, </p><p>trying to copy Koch\'s successful petition campaign in 1999 </p><p>against dual citizenship.  The SPD in north Hesse claims to </p><p>have collected 40,000 signatures in one day alone.  The CDU </p><p>remains concerned about war in Iraq before February 2.  The </p><p>Hesse CDU\'s election loss in 1991 is still widely attributed </p><p>to the Gulf War starting shortly before election day and the </p><p>subsequent protest vote against the Kohl administration\'s </p><p>position.  Thus far, polls indicate that continuing voter </p><p>unhappiness with the Schroeder administration outweighs </p><p>concerns about Iraq in Hesse\'s upcoming elections. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
