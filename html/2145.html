<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002832 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/05/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, MOPS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNOR THINKS NIGERIA HAS HIT A CRUCIAL PERIOD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 2787 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During an October 31 meeting with Polcouns </p><p>and Poloff, Kaduna State Governor Ahmed Makarfi cited recent </p><p>civil disturbances as very disquieting.  In order to prevent </p><p>further political turbulance, the Governors were assembling </p><p>in Abuja that day to discuss means to cool down the internal </p><p>security situation.  As an outgrowth of that meeting, a </p><p>smaller group of Governors would meet legislative leaders to </p><p>massage differences and egos bruised by the electoral law </p><p>controversy.  He predicted greater PDP cohesion and a </p><p>resumption of the convention schedule after a meeting of </p><p>party leaders also slated later that day.  While usually </p><p>supportive of the President, Makarfi attributed much of the </p><p>recent problems to Obasanjo\'s lack of domestic policy </p><p>direction, an imperial leadership style that spurs Obasanjo </p><p>to shun advice and crush dissent, and his surprising </p><p>lassitude in bringing known instigators of unrest to book. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>National Security </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The usually reserved and pro-Obasanjo Makarfi </p><p>incisively criticized President Obasanjo for his frequent </p><p>sallies into the arena of international diplomacy while </p><p>paying inadequate attention to the brushfires in his own </p><p>backyard.  Obasanjo should stay home more, Makarfi bluntly </p><p>declared. The Governor asserted Obasanjo was lethargic in </p><p>moving to prevent simmering tensions from hitting the boiling </p><p>point.  The crux of Makarfi\'s complaint was Obasanjo\'s </p><p>failure to aggressively prosecute known perpetrators of civil </p><p>unrest. Immediately after the Kaduna disturbances in February </p><p>2000, Makarfi recalled that Obasanjo went to Kaduna to insist </p><p>the State establish a Judicial Commission of Inquiry instead </p><p>of immediately prosecuting suspects already under arrest. </p><p>Obasanjo said that prosecuting people so quickly after the </p><p>rioting would "overheat the political system."  Makarfi said </p><p>Obasanjo cajoled and arm-twisted the Council of State to </p><p>follow his wishes.  The Judicial Commission was established </p><p>with the explicit promi </p><p>se that the Federal Government would toss the book at the </p><p>culprits identified by the Commission.  Although the </p><p>Commission completed its report in September 2000, the </p><p>President has failed to act on its findings, observed </p><p>Makarfi.  In fact, the only thing Obasanjo did with the </p><p>report was to write notes in the margins and return it to </p><p>Kaduna, shrugged Makarfi.  This set a bad precedent, sending </p><p>a message that people could bestir trouble with impunity, he </p><p>commented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  After 100 Hausa were killed in the OPC Ajegunle riot </p><p>of  October 2000 in Lagos, the FG seemed powerless to arrest </p><p>Gani Adams, the OPC ringleader.  (Comment: Adams finally was </p><p>arrested this August, but was released October 31.  Adams is </p><p>a bogeyman for many Northerners, and his release will, at a </p><p>minimum deepen their sense of alienation.  See reftel.  End </p><p>comment.)  During ethno-religious clashes which killed over </p><p>2300 in and around Jos in September, the President idled.  No </p><p>one was arrested.  The Federal government merely set up a </p><p>Commission of Inquiry weeks later.  It took Obasanjo a week </p><p>to visit the place, Makarfi complained.  President Obasanjo </p><p>erred in telling the press that the FG "knew" something would </p><p>happen in Kano this October, yet took no action to preclude </p><p>the violence.  The President\'s remarks implied a dereliction </p><p>of duty, Makarfi chided. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Makarfi said the Government\'s ineptitude in dealing </p><p>with these repeated crises created an atmosphere where </p><p>"troublemakers" thrive.  The recent Tiv-Jukun upheaval was </p><p>particularly disturbing.  He said Benue Governor Akume bore </p><p>some responsibility for the blow-up, adding that the </p><p>governors were going to address this issue with Akume. While </p><p>asserting that soldiers responsible for killing innocents </p><p>must be punished, Makarfi nonetheless believed the military </p><p>was compelled to send a strong deterrent message to those who </p><p>would attack soldiers.  The military had become the police </p><p>force of last resort, Makarfi thought.  "If people see the </p><p>military as vulnerable, if militias think they can touch the </p><p>military, the country could fall apart." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Comment:  Most Nigerians believe that the military </p><p>had to send a clear message to the Tiv militia and others who </p><p>might imitate them.  Military bases have been traditional </p><p>zones of refuge during bloody communal clashes.  While there </p><p>is a considerable debate over whether the military  (or </p><p>renegade elements of the military) went "too far" by killing </p><p>over 200 in Benue recently, there is little dissent from the </p><p>tenet that Nigeria\'s stability and integrity depend on strict </p><p>maintenance of the taboo on attacking soldiers.  End comment.) </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Election "Reform"--Background </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  The House and Senate have passed two competing </p><p>bills-both with provisions that safeguard incumbency--which </p><p>seek to restructure upcoming elections.  Currently, local </p><p>government elections are scheduled for April 13, 2002, </p><p>followed by gubernatorial and presidential elections in 2003. </p><p> Both bills presume the Assembly has the constitutional </p><p>authority to extend the tenure of local governments to 2003 </p><p>and delay local elections to that date.  The proposed </p><p>legislation has created a political logjam.  The Governors </p><p>don\'t want local elections delayed.  Delay would prevent them </p><p>from strengthening their political base among local </p><p>government area chairmen and councilors prior to the </p><p>gubernatorial elections in 2003. Incumbent LGA chairmen, the </p><p>National Assembly, and the President favor the changed LGA </p><p>election date for their own parochial reasons. </p><p>7. (C)  Makarfi lamented that the legislation pitted </p><p>Governors against the National Assembly, the Executive and </p><p>LGA chairmen.  This controversy, coupled with the recent </p><p>civil violence, created the appearance that the civilian </p><p>government could not manage the affairs of state, he </p><p>remarked.  Makarfi feared the security situation and </p><p>political logjams (including the internal PDP brouhaha) were </p><p>being watched "closely" by elements in the military.  Clearly </p><p>worried, Makarfi commented that six of his gubernatorial </p><p>colleagues had moved out of their official residences in </p><p>anticipation of a deteriorating security environment.  Since </p><p>the President had not acted, Makarfi said all 36 governors </p><p>were gathering in Abuja to hash out a compromise with the </p><p>Assembly leadership on the electoral reform issue. Makarfi </p><p>believed the gathering would also strike an informal </p><p>agreement </p><p>to eschew confrontational public statements that only roil </p><p>the water and complicate resolution of delicate issues.  Once </p><p>the agreement had been reached on these issues, a smaller </p><p>group of Governors and Assembly leaders would meet the </p><p>President, Makarfi stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>PDP Crisis </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Makarfi predicted progress in resolving the PDP </p><p>leadership squabbles that threaten to scuttle the party\'s </p><p>convention.  A party official had obtained a court injunction </p><p>to suspend ongoing Party congresses and the upcoming PDP </p><p>National Convention.  Despite the injunction, some states </p><p>held their local government congresses on October 27, while </p><p>others did not.  This inconsistency only added to the air of </p><p>confusion.  (Comment:  There is some speculation that </p><p>Barnabas Gemade and Okwesilieze Nwodo, PDP Chairman and </p><p>National Secretary, respectively, secretly instigated the </p><p>suit for injunctive relief in order to forestall their </p><p>probable ouster from party leadership at the upcoming </p><p>National Convention.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  The Governor\'s prediction was partially correct.  An </p><p>"inner caucus" of Governors, the VP and the President met on </p><p>October 31. That meeting produced agreement on lifting the </p><p>injunction.  Party congresses and the National Convention </p><p>have been rescheduled.  Presidential favorite, Works Minister </p><p>Tony Anenih, who had been expelled from the party by Gemade </p><p>for opposing the injunction, was also reinstated.  However, </p><p>the suddenly irascible Nwodo, who did not attend the October </p><p>31 "caucus," issued a public statement that the caucus was </p><p>improper and its decisions were nullities. The party remains </p><p>an untidy affair.  State congresses were held the November </p><p>3-4 weekend.  While most transpired without major problems, </p><p>there were parallel congresses set up by rival party factions </p><p>in several states.  In Enugu, a national assembly member was </p><p>kidnapped.  Moreover, there is still no sign that Gemade and </p><p>Nwodo have accepted the decision of October 31.  More </p><p>intransigent statements attributed to Gemade appeared in </p><p>major ne </p><p>wspapers November 6.  Thus, additional suits and injunctions </p><p>are possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Makarfi remarked that non-performing governors and </p><p>those who face serious opposition for the PDP nomination were </p><p>supporting Gemade in his bid to retain the Party </p><p>Chairmanship.  He said Gemade, a corrupt, ex-Abacha man, </p><p>would attempt to guarantee those governors the PDP nomination </p><p>in their states.  Audu Ogbeh, according to Makarfi, would not </p><p>intervene for any candidate but would be more concerned about </p><p>the fairness of the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO REFUSES TO LISTEN </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>11. (U) Makarfi believed the political situation would not </p><p>have become so dense if Obasanjo would listen to objective </p><p>advice.  Instead Obasanjo allowed himself to be manipulated </p><p>by an inner circle of advisors, some of whom do not have </p><p>Obasanjo\'s best interests at heart.  Vice President Atiku is </p><p>Obasanjo\'s worst enemy, Makarfi claimed.  Atiku persistently </p><p>coaxes Obasanjo into standoffs with the party, the National </p><p>Assembly and the Governors, asserted Makarfi.  Atiku\'s wants </p><p>the Presidency and his strategy is to weaken Obasanjo by </p><p>estranging him from important constituencies.  Makarfi </p><p>remarked that Obasanjo plays the willing dupe in this game. </p><p>He recalled that Obasanjo once relayed to Atiku a warning </p><p>Makarfi had given the President about the Vice-President. </p><p>Because Obasanjo betrayed his confidence that once, Makarfi </p><p>swore he would not advise Obasanjo about Atiku\'s duplicity </p><p>again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  Comment: Clearly concerned that the ship of state </p><p>had the appearance of being rudderless, Makarfi said a lot </p><p>during the meeting.  The different sessions between the </p><p>Governors, National Assembly and President seemed to have </p><p>reduced tensions for the time being.  Whether this is </p><p>permanent will become known soon enough.  Makarfi placed </p><p>responsibility for a large share of the current tumult at </p><p>Obasanjo\'s feet.  He believes Obasanjo will have to change </p><p>his leadership style and pay more attention to domestic </p><p>security matters if the spirit of compromise and dialogue </p><p>engendered by the sessions of October 31 meeting is to stick. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
