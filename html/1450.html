<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008538 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/26/2010 </p><p>TAGS: CG, ECON, PGOV, PINS, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: KISANGANI OBSERVATIONS AND IMPRESSIONS (II) </p><p> </p><p>REF: KINSHASA 8532 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Following is the second and final part of a report on </p><p>an Embassy staff member\'s visit to Kisangani November </p><p>28-December 1.  This message covers the political and </p><p>economic situation in Kisangani. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Political Situation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>       Emboff accompanied a Human Rights Law Group </p><p>representative on a courtesy visit to the "Governor" of </p><p>Orientale Province.  Making his case for US assistance, the </p><p>Governor explained how the international community had </p><p>ignored the province.  He stressed full support for Congolese </p><p>territorial integrity and implementation of Lusaka.  Echoing </p><p>a widely-held Kinshasa view, he asserted that the US could </p><p>stop the war with a phone call if it really wanted to.  The </p><p>presence at the meeting of the provincial head of security </p><p>was interpreted by Civil Society officials as evidence that </p><p>the governor is on shaky terms with his Goma mentors. </p><p>(Kisangani Civil Society generally believes that Kisangani </p><p>RCD officials are not completely trusted in Goma.  At any </p><p>rate, they receive meager support from Goma.) </p><p>     By all accounts, the Rwandan-supported occupation of </p><p>Kisangani is somewhat less oppressive than in Bukavu and Goma </p><p>although the population detests the RCD.  Human rights groups </p><p>are strong and continue to have access to private local radio </p><p>and television.  Few felt that there was much attempt to </p><p>control communications.  On the other hand, the RCD is </p><p>installing political "cells" in all businesses and </p><p>institutions.  Emboff had no opportunity to speak with </p><p>Archbishop Monsengwo, who was otherwise occupied the entire </p><p>period of the visit.  The general impression was, however, </p><p>that the bishop\'s popularity may have suffered somewhat as </p><p>the population seeks greater signs of peaceful resistance to </p><p>RCD occupation. </p><p>     The Hema-Lendu conflict of Bunia in eastern Orientale </p><p>Province has had repercussions in Kisangani, tending as it </p><p>has to polarize the large numbers of the intellectual elite </p><p>of both groups living in the city.  Despite human rights </p><p>organizations\' reconciliation efforts, a high level of </p><p>tension remains.  Both Hema and Lendu groups have been </p><p>exciting their membership via use of video footage showing </p><p>the bodies of their respective ethnic group being killed by </p><p>the other. </p><p>     The working environment for national and international </p><p>NGOs in Kisangani is mixed.  There is considerable harassment </p><p>in the form of petty taxes; as a result international NGOs </p><p>recently formed a joint "solidarity" committee in order to </p><p>confront the government with one voice.  The "governor" is </p><p>not highly regarded among NGOs.  E.g., he reportedly tried to </p><p>ensnare MSF/Belgium in a corruption scam.  Other </p><p>international NGOs (ICRC, IRC, MSF/Holland, Oxfam) protested </p><p>via a joint letter in support of MSF/Belgium, threatening to </p><p>take the matter to RCD headquarters in Goma if necessary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Isolation and "Balkanization" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     Two themes recur in nearly all discussions with Civil </p><p>Society and others in Kisangani: first, that Kisangani is </p><p>isolated, effectively cut off from the rest of the Congo both </p><p>east and west, as well as largely ignored by the rest of the </p><p>world.  From the "governor" on down, everyone in Kisangani </p><p>bemoaned this and expressed appreciation for foreigners who </p><p>now come for more than a same day visit.  Kisangani\'s pride </p><p>is hurt, as residents have watched the Congo\'s third largest </p><p>city become something of a backwater village neglected by </p><p>politicians, humanitarian aid workers, development agencies, </p><p>and diplomats.  All pointed out repeatedly that Goma and </p><p>Bukavu get all the attention. Notwithstanding, the visitor </p><p>found Kisangani far from "dead", but rather surprisingly </p><p>vibrant for a community with so few resources and outside </p><p>connections. </p><p>     The second common strain of most conversations in </p><p>Kisangani is the perceived "balkanization" of the province. </p><p>Residents are bitter and resentful that the international </p><p>community seemed to be doing nothing to prevent this.  They </p><p>can no longer travel freely around the province, both because </p><p>of a pre-travel authorization requirement and because of </p><p>security.  (To travel to Buta, for example, one needs to </p><p>leave RCD/Goma territory and enter MLC territory.  To travel </p><p>to Bunia, one needs to enter the "RCD-National" territory of </p><p>Roger Lumbala and then navigate through the territories of </p><p>the three competing rebel groups in the Bunia-Butembo-Beni </p><p>area.)  It is obvious to local residents that Orientale </p><p>province has ceased being a province and deteriorated into a </p><p>number of fiefdoms dominated by various strongmen (including </p><p>Ugandans and Rwandans). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Economic Situation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     As throughout the Congo, these are very hard times </p><p>economically for Kisangani.  Kisangani suffers more from the </p><p>war than do some other areas in that the armed conflict has </p><p>cut off the city from all of its major trade partners.  E.g., </p><p>there has been no river traffic with Mbandaka and Kinshasa to </p><p>the west for two years now, with major economic </p><p>repercussions.  Though the city is commonly thought of as </p><p>being commercially and politically more tied to the east than </p><p>to the west, local traders suggest that this is largely a </p><p>misconception, since all of Kisangani\'s major commercial </p><p>enterprises traded more with Kinshasa than with the east, </p><p>taking advantage of lower-cost river transportation.  The </p><p>only river traffic now are canoes that come upstream with </p><p>limited agricultural produce.  Even these, however, have </p><p>diminished greatly in number, as the number of "roadblocks" </p><p>for "taxes" on the river has blossomed (fifteen or so between </p><p>Kisangani and Bumba, and three between Yangambi and Kisangani </p><p>alone), making this route no longer profitable for even </p><p>small-time traders.  To the north and east, roads are </p><p>insecure and in poor condition.  There the frequency of </p><p>trucks being ambushed has caused vehicular traffic to </p><p>disappear completely.  This limits Kisangani to dependence </p><p>either on bicycle transporters or aircraft from the east for </p><p>virtually everything but locally-available agricultural </p><p>produce.  Few companies in the east have attempted </p><p>large-scale importing, however, perhaps for lack of large </p><p>aircraft.  As a result, according to an OCHA investigation, </p><p>food prices in Kisangani are considerably higher than in Goma. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Diamond Trade Moves Away </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     Interlocuteurs repeatedly pointed out to Emboff that the </p><p>diamond trade which traditionally constituted the city\'s </p><p>economic base has moved away from Kisangani.  A little-known </p><p>consequence of the Rwanda-Uganda "six-day" war in Kisangani </p><p>and the subsequent withdrawal of the Ugandans is that </p><p>although Kisangani itself remained in the RCD/Goma (i.e. </p><p>Rwandan) sphere of influence, the Ugandans retained control </p><p>of most of the diamond-producing areas, which lie to the </p><p>northeast and northwest of the city.  As diamonds now go out </p><p>directly via northern routes to Kampala, Kisangani is largely </p><p>bereft of the diamond trade.  The Kisangani diamond trader </p><p>who received an RCD monopoly on diamond exports eventually </p><p>gave up and left town because he could not raise enough </p><p>revenue from new diamonds to pay $100,000 in monthly taxes </p><p>required in return for the monopoly.  Many believe that </p><p>Kisangani\'s inaccessibility to diamond revenue may have been </p><p>the underlying reason that the RCD sent troops into MLC </p><p>territory in mid-November.  As is often reported of areas </p><p>where Rwandan soldiers control diamond-producing areas, </p><p>Ugandan soldiers do not pay appropriate prices for diamonds. </p><p>Diggers are forced to sell only to Ugandans who conspire to </p><p>keep prices low.  Civil Society leaders in Kisangani also </p><p>suspect that coltan and niobium are also being exported in </p><p>significant quantities from Orientale Province directly to </p><p>Uganda and Rwanda. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
