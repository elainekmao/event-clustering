<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002243 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PREF, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MODERATES IN PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP UNEASY ABOUT </p><p>U.S. INTENTIONS IN AFTERMATH OF ISRAELI OFFENSIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Gerg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary and Comment:  In the aftermath of Israel\'s </p><p>Operation Defensive Shield, the mood among even moderate </p><p>factions in Amman\'s Wihdat refugee camp is suspicious and </p><p>uneasy about Israeli and U.S. intentions.  In a May 1 </p><p>meeting with emboffs, Palestinian notables from Wihdat </p><p>questioned U.S. "protection" of Israel as evidenced by </p><p>cancellation of the UN\'s Jenin fact-finding mission; </p><p>questioned stated U.S. support for the creation of a </p><p>Palestinian state; and warned that the recent Israeli </p><p>offensive would lead to greater political extremism within </p><p>the West Bank and Jordan.  The notables believe the only </p><p>way to repair the damage of the last few months is to make </p><p>dramatic progress toward the creation of a Palestinian </p><p>state. End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Refcoord and poloff met on May 1 with former member </p><p>of Parliament Mohamed al-Kuz and Palestinian notables from </p><p>Wihdat refugee camp.  Wihdat, located within and </p><p>indistinguishable from Amman\'s poorer eastern </p><p>neighborhoods, is one of Jordan\'s largest and most </p><p>politically active Palestinian refugee camps. It also has </p><p>been the scene of some of the more violent demonstrations </p><p>in recent weeks.  Al-Kuz and the notables who accompanied </p><p>him represent the most moderate faction among Jordan\'s </p><p>Palestinian refugee camps:  those who embrace a two-state </p><p>solution and fully support the Jordanian regime and its </p><p>pro-U.S. policies. </p><p> </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT IN U.S. "PROTECTION" OF ISRAEL FOLLOWING </p><p>JENIN "CRIMES" </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) As soon as the pleasantries were out of the way, a </p><p>clearly distressed notable began questioning emboffs about </p><p>the UN\'s decision to cancel the fact-finding mission to </p><p>Jenin refugee camp.  Somberly telling emboffs that his own </p><p>relative had personally witnessed the IDF loading </p><p>Palestinian corpses into trucks and "taking them to an </p><p>Israeli crocodile farm within the West Bank," the notable </p><p>wanted to know why the U.S. was "protecting" Israel.  No </p><p>other army in the world, he told emboffs, would be allowed </p><p>to get away with the "crimes" committed in Jenin refugee </p><p>camp.  (Note:  ConGen Jerusalem confirms that there is, in </p><p>fact, a crocodile farm in the West Bank.  The notable\'s </p><p>story might not seem outlandish to a Palestinian familiar </p><p>with the West Bank.) </p><p> </p><p>QUESTIONING THE DETAILS OF U.S. VISION </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The notables questioned emboffs extensively about </p><p>the U.S. vision of two states -- Israel and Palestine -- </p><p>living side-by-side in peace and security.  Explaining that </p><p>they believed the U.S. had given an implicit "green light" </p><p>for Israeli destruction of PA facilities in the West Bank, </p><p>the notables wondered whether U.S. support for a </p><p>Palestinian state extended only to Gaza.  And if a </p><p>Palestinian state were limited to Gaza, they asked, did the </p><p>U.S. support a federation of the West Bank with Jordan? </p><p>The notables were also concerned about the purpose of a new </p><p>international peace conference.  Hadn\'t the Madrid </p><p>conference created an appropriate framework?  And if a new </p><p>conference were convened, the notables asked, would the </p><p>international community absolve Israel of its </p><p>responsibilities under the Oslo process?  The notables </p><p>asked emboffs how Palestinians could ever believe Israel </p><p>would be held accountable to its agreements, if the </p><p>international community "gave up" on Oslo. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Given the widespread damage inflicted by the IDF in </p><p>the West Bank, the notables also wondered how anyone could </p><p>realistically expect peace in the immediate aftermath of </p><p>Operation Defensive Shield.  Stressing repeatedly that they </p><p>themselves did not condone violence, the notables warned </p><p>that Palestinian humiliation and suffering of the last </p><p>month will result in "thousands" more suicide bombers. </p><p>Only the creation of a Palestinian state will alleviate </p><p>tensions. </p><p> </p><p>NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS FOR JORDANIAN DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Wihdat camp leadership fears that the Israeli </p><p>offensive will lead to greater popular support for </p><p>political extremism within Jordan.  Pointing to the Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood\'s "sweeping" victory in late April\'s </p><p>Engineering Association elections, Al-Kuz told emboffs that </p><p>many people now believe the MB was right to reject the Oslo </p><p>process.  After watching weeks of destruction in the West </p><p>Bank, Jordanians could only believe that engagement with </p><p>Israel would bring "ruin" to the Palestinians.  The only </p><p>possible solution to turn Jordanians away from extremism </p><p>would be the immediate creation of the state of Palestine. </p><p>Absent such a move, Al-Kuz believes King Abdullah will have </p><p>no choice but to postpone Jordan\'s upcoming but still </p><p>unscheduled parliamentary elections in order to prevent an </p><p>MB victory.  Al-Kuz noted that such a decision would be in </p><p>full accord with Jordan\'s constitution and likely greeted </p><p>with relief by political moderates like himself.  He </p><p>predicted that the King would call the former Parliament </p><p>back into session. </p><p> </p><p>SUPPORT FOR MAINTAINING TIES WITH ISRAEL </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Al-Kuz and the notables expressed strong support </p><p>for the GOJ\'s decision to maintain ties with Israel. </p><p>Although they acknowledged that there is great popular </p><p>demand for a complete break in relations, the notables said </p><p>relations with Israel are necessary to provide a "lifeline" </p><p>to the Palestinian people.  Through its relations with </p><p>Israel and subsequent ability to funnel Arab aid to the </p><p>West Bank, Jordan is the "savior" of the Palestinian </p><p>people. </p><p> </p><p>WIHDAT SADDENED; CALM FOR NOW </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Echoing comments made by sources from other camps, </p><p>the notables described the mood in Wihdat as very sad. </p><p>They said "everyone" has had a relative killed, arrested, </p><p>or left homeless during the recent incursions.  Although </p><p>Wihdat had been the scene of some of the most violent </p><p>confrontations between demonstrators and police, the </p><p>notables believe only an extreme Israeli action, such as an </p><p>invasion of Gaza, would trigger renewed violence within the </p><p>camp. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Al-Kuz and the notables from Wihdat represent the </p><p>most moderate thinking among Jordan\'s Palestinian refugee </p><p>camps.  Although they still strongly support a two-state </p><p>solution, their skepticism over the details and U.S. </p><p>willingness to pressure Israel to meet its obligations, </p><p>reveals an important change in the mood of moderates </p><p>following </p><p>Israeli incursions into the West Bank.  Absent dramatic </p><p>progress toward the creation of a Palestinian state -- a </p><p>Palestinian state politically acceptable to Palestinians -- </p><p>their pro-regime and pro-U.S. stance may be hard to maintain. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
