<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002928 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON SUICIDE BOMBINGS AND MIDDLE </p><p>EAST </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- A major story in all papers today, May 19, </p><p>highlights the suicide bus bombing that took place in </p><p>Jerusalem yesterday, killing seven Israelis.  Lead </p><p>stories today focus on preparations for the Jordanian </p><p>parliamentary election scheduled for June 17.  Lead </p><p>stories in all papers yesterday, May 18, focuses on </p><p>the suicide bombings in Casablanca, Morocco and the </p><p>international reaction of condemnation for these </p><p>"terrorist" actions. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Who let terror win?" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (05/19) editorializes:  "It is extremely </p><p>saddening and frustrating to see terrorists succeed </p><p>once again, and peace hopes repeatedly dashed because </p><p>of terror.  But it is also true that terrorists win </p><p>when they are allowed to, when there is not enough </p><p>political will to show them that they will not succeed </p><p>in shaping history on their terms..  We absolutely </p><p>condemn the Palestinian suicide bomber who killed </p><p>seven people aboard a Jerusalem bus on Sunday.  But </p><p>this terrorist and his group would not have achieved </p><p>their goal had Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon not </p><p>put off a trip to Washington for crucial talks with </p><p>President George W. Bush on the roadmap..  The </p><p>terrorists who blew themselves up . certainly wanted </p><p>to derail whatever was left of the peace process.  But </p><p>Sharon greatly helped them by putting off his peace </p><p>talks in the United States..  How convenient for </p><p>Sharon yesterday\'s suicide attacks were.  He himself </p><p>could not have found a better excuse to once again </p><p>avoid facing his responsibilities and the unanimous </p><p>will of the international community.  Instead, these </p><p>Jerusalem bombers handed over to him on a silver plate </p><p>the perfect pretext to continue ignoring international </p><p>and regional peace efforts." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Events and mysteries" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Rakan Majali writes on the back page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/19):  "The world embarked on a new era after the </p><p>9/11 attacks.  It did have something to do with </p><p>America wanting to take advantage of this terrorist </p><p>crime to launch new strategies and new policies and </p><p>implement its plans for the Arab world and the Muslim </p><p>world in order to affect its hegemony over the world. </p><p>Worse than achieving these objectives by military </p><p>force and aggression is this mystery, the sneakiness </p><p>and all this mystery that envelops the events that </p><p>started with the 9/11 attacks and continues until </p><p>today..  Mysteries continue, including the bombings in </p><p>Riyadh and Casablanca.  The bombings in Saudi occurred </p><p>a few days after Saudi\'s agreement with the United </p><p>States to get the latter\'s troops out of Saudi.  The </p><p>bombings in Morocco occurred after the successful of </p><p>the democratic experience there.  We must also note </p><p>that these bombings occurred in two big countries, one </p><p>in the east and one in the west.  The purpose is to </p><p>weaken and confuse everyone..  We must therefore ask </p><p>this legitimate question:  is what is happening in the </p><p>Arab world now another form of and just another part </p><p>of the war and pressures that aim to weaken and </p><p>confuse everyone to pave the way for what the U.S. </p><p>Secretary of State spoke of regarding a comprehensive </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>change in the region within ten years, or is just pure </p><p>coincidence?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Arab world between two fires" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(05/18):  "The fact that Al-Qa\'eda moved its war </p><p>against the Americans into Arab countries is an </p><p>indication of the seriousness of this terrorism that </p><p>is sending tens of young Arab people to blow </p><p>themselves up in operations that, at the end of the </p><p>day, serve only the warmongers within the U.S. </p><p>administration and the policies of the Zionist Lobby </p><p>that is trying to drag the American nation into a </p><p>state of constant battle with the Arabs.  The Arab </p><p>world is now caught between two fires: the fire of </p><p>blind terrorism that wants to turn the domestic scene </p><p>of Arab countries into arenas for destruction and </p><p>sabotage, and the fire of Bush\'s war against the </p><p>terrorism, the person who does not want to understand </p><p>the reasons that serve terrorism and does not want to </p><p>resolve the issues, without which terrorism cannot be </p><p>eliminated..  The Arab world is destined to pay for </p><p>the mistakes and sins of American policies in the form </p><p>of blind terrorism destroying the security, stability </p><p>and economy of Arab countries.  As much as the Bali </p><p>bombings destroyed tourism in Indonesia in favor of </p><p>tourism in Australia - an ally of the United States </p><p>and took part in the Iraq war, the bombings in </p><p>Casablanca will destroy tourism in Morocco in favor of </p><p>tourism in Spain - one of the allies in the war on </p><p>Iraq." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
