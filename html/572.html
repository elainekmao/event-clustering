<p>UNCLAS DAMASCUS 08730 </p><p> </p><p>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR HA, NEA/ARN </p><p>LONDON FOR JOHNSON </p><p>PARIS FOR ROSENBLATT </p><p> </p><p>MOSCOW FOR NEA A/S DJEREJIAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, PGOV, PINS, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  ASAD GRANTS AMNESTY FOR 540 POLITICAL PRISONERS </p><p> </p><p>1.  SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASAD HAS ISSUED A DECREE GRANTING </p><p>AN AMNESTY TO 540 PRISONERS HELD ON "SECURITY" GROUNDS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE MAIN NEWS BULLETIN ON GOVERNMENT- </p><p>CONTROLLED DAMASCUS RADIO AT 1415 LOCAL TIME, DECEMBER </p><p>1.  THE BRIEF BULLETIN DID NOT ELABORATE ON THE </p><p>IDENTITIES OF THE PRISONERS, THE NATURE OF THEIR </p><p>OFFENSES, OR THE OCCASION FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S DECISION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN A RELATED MATTER, WE NOTE FROM THE NOVEMBER 27 </p><p>EDITION OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE LEBANESE NEWSPAPER </p><p>"L\'ORIENT-LE JOUR" THAT SYRIAN EX-PRESIDENT NUR AL-DIN </p><p>AL-ATASI (WHO WAS PRESIDENT WHEN ASAD SEIZED POWER IN </p><p>1970) REPORTEDLY ARRIVED IN PARIS BY PRIVATE PLANE FROM </p><p>DAMASCUS A FEW DAYS EARLIER TO BEGIN TREATMENT AT THE </p><p>AMERICAN HOSPITAL IN NEUILLY OF CANCER OF THE </p><p>ESOPHAGUS.  AL-ATASI WAS FREED ON MEDICAL GROUNDS IN </p><p>LATE AUGUST.  UNTIL RECENTLY A SYRIAN HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP </p><p>BASED IN PARIS ALLEGED THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>HINDERING AL-ATASI\'S FAMILY\'S EFFORTS TO TRANSPORT HIM </p><p>TO PARIS (A CHARGE DENIED AT THE TIME BY AN MFA </p><p>OFFICIAL). </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENT:  AMONG THE POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS LATEST </p><p>RELEASE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS IS THE 22ND ANNIVERSARY </p><p>OF THE "CORRECTIONIST MOVEMENT" COUP THAT BROUGHT ASAD </p><p>TO POWER.  ALTHOUGH THAT ANNIVERSARY ACTUALLY FELL ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 16, A LAG OF TWO WEEKS WOULD FOLLOW THE PATTERN </p><p>OF PREVIOUS RELEASES (THE LATE MARCH RELEASE WAS </p><p>ANNOUNCED TWO WEEKS AFTER ASAD\'S SWEARING-IN TO A FOURTH </p><p>TERM IN OFFICE, WHILE LAST DECEMBER\'S AMNESTY WAS </p><p>PUBLICIZED TWO WEEKS AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>REFERENDUM).  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THESE RELEASES </p><p>ARE RELATED TO SESSIONS OF THE STATE SECURITY COURT THAT </p><p>HAVE BEEN UNDERWAY FOR SOME TIME TO DETERMINE THE </p><p>SENTENCES FOR POLITICAL DETAINEES WHO HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY </p><p>BEEN BROUGHT TO TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  THIS LATEST AMNESTY FOLLOWS THE </p><p>APPEARANCE IN THE NOVEMBER 29 EDITION OF THE OFFICIAL </p><p>NEWSPAPER "AL-BA\'TH" OF AN EDITORIAL WRITTEN BY VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT MASHARQA CHIDING WESTERN GOVERNMENTS FOR THEIR </p><p>CRITICISMS OF SYRIA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.  MASHARQA </p><p>ACCUSED THESE GOVERNMENTS OF APPLYING DOUBLE STANDARDS </p><p>IN JUDGING THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATIONS IN OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES WHILE IGNORING PROBLEMS (LIKE RACIAL </p><p>DISCRIMINATION) IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES OR IN "RACIST </p><p>COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY ISRAEL AND SOUTH AFRICA."  AS FOR </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, MASHARQA COMPLAINED THAT </p><p>THESE GROUPS FAIL TO PAY ATTENTION TO "ISRAELI CRIMES." </p><p>HE CONCLUDED THAT "THE MOTIVE BEHIND THE STANDS OF MOST </p><p>WESTERN STATES AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS ON THE ISSUE OF </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS IS TO PUT PRESSURE ON COUNTRIES WHOSE </p><p>POLICIES ARE GOVERNED BY NATIONAL OR PAN-ARAB INTERESTS </p><p>WHICH ARE NOT HARMONIOUS WITH THEIR PURPOSES AND </p><p>INTERESTS."  WHILE THE DECISION TO LET AL-ATASI GO TO </p><p>PARIS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN MADE QUIETLY TO SATISFY </p><p>EXTERNAL CRITICS, ASAD IS TRYING NOT TO LOOK LIKE HE </p><p>YIELDED TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE </p><p>AMNESTY.  MASHARQA\'S TOUGH PUBLIC STANCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>BEFORE THESE RELEASES ECHOES THE ONE ASAD USED IN HIS </p><p>MARCH 14 INAUGURATION SPEECH, WHICH CAME TWO WEEKS </p><p>BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SIMILAR AMNESTY. </p><p> </p><p>ROSS </p><p></p></div>
