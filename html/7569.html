Foreign ministers of Iraq\'s </p><p>neighbors met at a summit meeting in Riyadh.  The final </p><p>declaration of the summit, which originally carried strongly- </p><p>worded accusations against the U.S. and UK, was softened </p><p>through Foreign Minister Gul\'s efforts.  Iran was the only </p><p>regional country to support Turkey\'s thesis for the </p><p>establishment of a democratic regime in Iraq.  The summit </p><p>declaration urged coalition forces to leave Iraq as soon as </p><p>possible.  Gul reportedly said he has received a message in </p><p>support of the meeting from Secretary Powell.  Monday\'s </p><p>papers report that access to Kirkuk is still controlled by </p><p>PUK peshmerges, who force Arabs out of their homes to </p><p>facilitate the return of Kurds.  Prime Minister Erdogan said </p><p>on Sunday that he saw no negative development in Northern </p><p>Iraq regarding Turkey\'s `red lines.\'  PUK leader Talabani </p><p>denied reports of atrocities against the Turkomen, and said </p><p>he had informed Turkish liaison officers in the region about </p><p>the good relations between Kurds and Turks.  Talabani </p><p>claimed that the Turkomen Front could not get even ten </p><p>percent of the vote in an election in Kirkuk, a town of </p><p>700,000.  The U.S. will close its bases in Saudi Arabia and </p><p>move troops from bases in Saudi Arabia and Turkey to four </p><p>new airbases in Iraq, Monday papers report.  Commentators </p><p>speculate that the significance of Incirlik airbase is </p><p>gradually fading for the U.S.. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Greek Prime Minister Simitis said during his visit </p><p>to the Greek Cypriot sector that Greece has reached its goal </p><p>of `Enosis\' (integration between Cyprus and Greece) goal. </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul said such remarks, if they were really </p><p>said, were verification of Turkey\'s worries about Cyprus. </p><p>Weekend papers cover in detail Simitis\' visit to the Greek </p><p>Cypriot sector.  Simitis was the first Greek head of </p><p>government to visit Cyprus since 1974.  Addressing the Greek </p><p>Cypriot parliament, Simitis said that Greeks and Turks on </p><p>Cyprus should join the EU together, which, he believes, </p><p>would lead to drastic changes in Greek-Turkish relations. </p><p>Athens has abandoned its policy of blocking Turkey\'s EU </p><p>membership drive, and Ankara should respond to this gesture </p><p>by recognizing Southern Cyprus.  Simitis also reportedly </p><p>issued a warning that Turkey would have to choose between EU </p><p>membership and Cyprus.  Simitis later held a meeting with </p><p>Turkish Cypriot opposition leaders, who reportedly told </p><p>Simitis that the Annan plan for Cyprus should be preserved </p><p>as a ground for solution efforts.  Sunday\'s papers speculate </p><p>that the meeting was the initial move in an effort to </p><p>discard Denktas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Rebuilding Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey\'s share" </p><p>Asli Aydintasbas wrote from Washington in mass appeal Sabah </p><p>(4/21): "According to US officials, Turkey will have very </p><p>good opportunities in the Iraqi rebuilding process, </p><p>particularly in the construction and food sectors.  It seems </p><p>that the Washington administration now has begun to focus on </p><p>the rebuilding program, and Turkey will be one of the main </p><p>countries to benefit from this process. . While the plans </p><p>for Iraqi rebuilding are underway, the Bush administration </p><p>has also decided to close the `Syria file\' after issuing </p><p>strong warnings to Damascus.  A source close to the </p><p>Washington administration said that `the message was well </p><p>taken\' by Syrian authorities.  . It seems that the Syrian </p><p>administration reaffirmed its cooperation with the US, and </p><p>declared that it is not going to become a haven for former </p><p>members of Saddam\'s regime. Therefore, Washington has closed </p><p>the file at least for the time being, which also ended </p><p>concerns in both the Arab world and Europe that Syria was to </p><p>be the next on the list." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Things for the US to accomplish in Iraq" </p><p>Fikret Bila wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (4/19): "Toppling </p><p>Saddam\'s regime is a mission accomplished for the coalition. </p><p>However, the demonstrations after Friday prayers show that </p><p>the serious mission is about to begin, and the US is not </p><p>very sure how to replace the regime.  With the exception of </p><p>Kurdish groups, there is no social or political movement in </p><p>Iraq that supports the invasion. . The people of Iraq are </p><p>certainly happy to see that the regime is gone, but will not </p><p>be happy about a puppet regime manipulated by the US.  The </p><p>US is not going to be successful if it takes only Kurds into </p><p>the reshaping of Iraq\'s political structure. The Washington </p><p>administration seems to realize this fact.  On the other </p><p>hand, US and UK forces can only pursue power via weapons, </p><p>and it looks as if eventually there will be a new Iraqi </p><p>regime established by the use of force.  This is because </p><p>going to elections at this early stage would be a pointless </p><p>effort.  The war for the US has now moved to the political </p><p>front, which is tougher than the military action itself." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
