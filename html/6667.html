<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000554 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT, TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, CASC, PINS, ASEC, PREF, PGOV, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: VIOLENCE ESCALATES IN ESCRAVOS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Proprietary information in paragraphs 3-4.  Please </p><p>protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Summary: Escalating violence between Ijaws and </p><p>Itsekiris have combined with security inadequacies to force </p><p>ChevronTexaco and Shell to halt some operations, reducing </p><p>Nigeria\'s crude production by  350,000-400,000 bpd.  If the </p><p>unrest spreads, oil production could fall further, impacting </p><p>negatively both U.S. energy security and Nigeria\'s political and </p><p>fiscal stability.  Several thousand persons are now IDPs.  There </p><p>are no reports of AmCit injuries.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>LOST PRODUCTION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) On March 20, Sola Omole, ChevronTexaco\'s Manager of </p><p>Government and Public Affairs, told EconOff that ChevronTexaco </p><p>had shut down its operation in Escravos, halting production of </p><p>nearly 140,000 bpd of crude oil, almost 50 percent of its </p><p>production from that area.  He mentioned that Shell had also </p><p>temporarily reduced production by 126,000 barrels of crude per </p><p>day. However, British High Commissioner Thomas told Ambassador </p><p>Jeter on March 22 that Shell was losing up to 250,000 barrels </p><p>daily. Omole confirmed one of the company\'s catering staff had </p><p>died two days earlier of gunshot wounds; another six employees </p><p>were injured.  All are Nigerian nationals.  As of March 20, the </p><p>GON had deployed about 150 troops to the Escravos area since the </p><p>violence began on March 17 and another 1,000 troops to the Warri </p><p>area, where there is similar unrest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) To the above-mentioned lost production should be added </p><p>unknown losses (by some estimates just over 30,000 bpd) from the </p><p>closure of a TotalFinaElf flow-station in the area.  In short, </p><p>Nigeria\'s production seems to have fallen by roughly 350,000- </p><p>400,000 bpd within the past five days. Omole warned (septel from </p><p>Lagos) that ChevronTexaco might reduce its production by another </p><p>300,000 bpd in the days and weeks ahead if progress could not be </p><p>made in defusing the inter-ethnic conflict. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) COMMENT: It is difficult to estimate production losses </p><p>accurately and harder still to predict future cuts.  The joint- </p><p>venture companies (JVs) in the Nigerian petroleum sector tend to </p><p>declare force majeure swiftly when confronted by violence in </p><p>production areas, not just to protect against future claims by </p><p>customers, but also to put pressure on the GON to defuse the </p><p>underlying tensions.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) On March 2, an Ijaw group, the Federated Niger Delta </p><p>Ijaw Communities, had threatened mass protests on March 10 if the </p><p>Government of Nigeria failed to meet their demands.  These </p><p>included withdrawal of troops from Warri (the troops were keeping </p><p>the Ijaw militias from attacking their less well-armed ethnic </p><p>opponents), redrawing electoral boundaries in Warri, examination </p><p>of land ownership, and redistribution of oil revenues.  The Ijaw </p><p>ultimatum ordered the oil companies to leave the area since the </p><p>Ijaws\' dispute was with the GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Because of the violence, ChevronTexaco and Shell began </p><p>evacuating non-essential employees. Omole said crew changes had </p><p>been put on hold. An indicator of how tense the situation was </p><p>this week was that a helicopter evacuating Shell employees was </p><p>fired upon. Following this incident, all the air carriers serving </p><p>Warri and environs -- Aero Contractors, Dana, Bristow </p><p>Helicopters, Pan African Airlines, and Associated Airlines -- </p><p>temporarily halted flights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>IMPACT ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Omole said 2,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) </p><p>(almost all Itsekiri fleeing the better-armed Ijaw) had taken </p><p>refuge at ChevronTexaco\'s Escravos tank farm as of March 21. </p><p>Omole had heard but could not confirm that ten villages had been </p><p>destroyed.  During March 18-21, Chevron evacuated many IDPs to </p><p>Warri via air.  Because ChevronTexaco must deal with remaining </p><p>IDPs at Escravos, it deferred evacuating those  employees who </p><p>were helping with the displaced persons until March 21-22, when </p><p>the Ijaw attacks intensified.  The Ijaws reportedly have </p><p>complained that ChevronTexaco is impeding their efforts against </p><p>the Itsekiri, but, thus far, have apparently have not </p><p>specifically targeted ChevronTexaco employees, and they have not </p><p>attacked the tank farm itself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>MINIMAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION EFFORTS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) According to Omole, no GON authority appears to be </p><p>engaged in conflict resolution with the Ijaws. He confirmed that </p><p>the British High Commission and Dutch Embassy were trying to see </p><p>how they could help; he asked that Ambassador Jeter urge the GON </p><p>to engage in talks with the warring parties.  Although the oil </p><p>companies were being affected, Omole thought the attacks indeed </p><p>were not directed against their operations and that GON </p><p>engagement at a high enough level might be a useful measure to </p><p>help restore production. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) This message should be read in conjunction with </p><p>reporting from ConGen Lagos (where much of this message was </p><p>drafted) and an Abuja septel reporting Ambassador Jeter\'s March </p><p>21 midnight discussion with President Obasanjo. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
