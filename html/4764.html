<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002822 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. 0. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Bulawayo\'s Sullen Industrialists </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Exasperated by employee flight to </p><p>neighboring countries and an ever more intrusive </p><p>bureaucracy, firms in Zimbabwe\'s second largest city </p><p>say they will not survive if the GOZ implements its </p><p>2003 budget.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Workers, firms exiting Zimbabwe </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>2. Econchief recently descended upon industrial </p><p>center Bulawayo to visit firms that either import </p><p>from or export to the U.S.  The impression we return </p><p>with is not encouraging.  The three apparel </p><p>producers we met with are moving, respectively, to </p><p>South Africa, the black market and despair.  The   . </p><p>first told us he is unable to maintain his machinery </p><p>due to the high cost of foreign exchange and will </p><p>restart his plant in South Africa.  The second, a </p><p>hunting/safari clothes exporter to the U.S., said he </p><p>is surviving but only because he lets politically- </p><p>connected indigenous rather than international banks </p><p>handle his accounts.  "I don\'t know how they do it </p><p>and I don\'t ask," he said. </p><p> </p><p>3. The third, a supplier to Eddie Bauer in the U.S., </p><p>admitted he is also looking for greener pastures </p><p>outside Zimbabwe but is reluctant because the family </p><p>business has been a Bulawayo fixture since 1957. </p><p>However, he is losing 3 trained workers per day, </p><p>mostly to competitors in Botswana, an annual </p><p>attrition rate over 100 percent.  The GOZ has </p><p>nullified any benefits he can use to attract and </p><p>retain staff, by a) raiding the once well-heeled </p><p>Clothing Industry Pension Pund and b) preventing him </p><p>from spending foreign exchange earnings on bicycles </p><p>and maize meal for his employees.  (Explanatory </p><p>note:  The new 2003 budget compels exporters to </p><p>surrender half their export earnings to the Reserve </p><p>Bank, ostensibly for official exchange but in </p><p>practice as an indirect tax.  To spend the remaining </p><p>half their earnings, firms must convince the Reserve </p><p>Bank that purchases are for "priority" items.  In </p><p>spite of Zimbabwe\'s transport and food problems, the </p><p>Reserve Bank turned down the firm\'s request to buy </p><p>bicycles or maize meal for employees.)  The owner </p><p>feels he can no longer overcome these obstacles, not </p><p>to mention less favorable tariffs stemming from </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s failure to qualify for the African Growth </p><p>and Opportunity Act (AGOA). </p><p> </p><p>Climate of despair </p><p>------------------ </p><p>4. The head of Bulawayo\'s Zimbabwe Investment Center </p><p>said he now gets so few inquiries from foreign </p><p>investors that he has trouble justifying his </p><p>office\'s existence.  The local Confederation of </p><p>Industries president said many companies are </p><p>considering shutting their doors beyond the </p><p>Christmas break while they wait (read: pray) for </p><p>more workable policies.  His own cement company </p><p>lacks foreign exchange to keep its expensive </p><p>Caterpillar machines running.  (Further explanatory </p><p>note: Since the cement firm does not export, it has </p><p>no Foreign Currency Account.  Meanwhile, the 2003 </p><p>budget makes it illegal to buy foreign currency at </p><p>parallel rates from bureaux de change.)  The </p><p>National Railway of Zimbabwe, which Bulawayo </p><p>producers depend on for freight transport, is down </p><p>to just 9 working locomotives. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. Our visit to Bulawayo confirms that the GOZ\'s </p><p>management of foreign exchange in- and outflows will </p><p>make-or-break companies, industries or even the </p><p>economy.  The forex-starved GOZ is not letting an </p><p>apparel company import bicycles or maize meal for </p><p>workers, or coffee and cotton producers b </p><p>uy </p><p>herbicides and pesticides, hardly the stuff of </p><p>frivolous extravagance.  Some White- and Asian-owned </p><p>businesses fear the GOZ will only approve forex </p><p>expenses of Black-owned firms, turning Foreign </p><p>Currency Accounts into a vehicle for indigenization </p><p>of the economy.  Whether true or not, the GOZ will </p><p>surely run exporters out of businesses by refusing </p><p>them access to even half their earnings. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
