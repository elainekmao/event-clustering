<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000965 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TRA-SUSAN PARSON AND WHA/CAN-BILL MCCULLA </p><p>DHS FOR F. KINNEY </p><p>DHS FOR JOE O\'GORMAN AND LIZ TISDALE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR HSC-CHRIS HORNBARGER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ECON, PREF </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA EXPLAINS NEW GLITCH IN AVIATION </p><p>PRECLEARANCE AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>1. This is an action request.  See paragraph 9. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and </p><p>International Trade (DFAIT) expressed mild apologies delay in </p><p>Canadian internal procedures are slowing down the entry into </p><p>force of the new aviation preclearance agreement.   DFAIT </p><p>explained that the GOC cannot bring the agreement into force </p><p>until Transport Canada designates the exact locations of the </p><p>preclearance sites at the Montreal (Dorval), Vancouver, and </p><p>Calgary Airports.  Preclearance areas in these three airports </p><p>have changed since they were last designated.  DFAIT said </p><p>Transport Canada began this designation process a few weeks </p><p>ago, soon after the U.S. passed reciprocity legislation </p><p>necessary to bring the agreement into effect, but it has not </p><p>been completed.  DFAIT said the process might take four to </p><p>six weeks, but did not indicate why the GOC had waited until </p><p>the U.S. legislation had passed to begin this process. </p><p> </p><p>3. The "designations" are important, DFAIT said, because the </p><p>new (2001) preclearance agreement provides U.S. officers a </p><p>measure of law enforcement authority by permitting them to </p><p>detain individuals on Canadian soil.  Thus, DFAIT argues, </p><p>Canadian law requires that the GOC specify exactly the areas </p><p>where U.S. officers have this authority. </p><p> </p><p>4.    Because the Montreal preclearance area has changed </p><p>significantly, Transport Canada and other parties are </p><p>conducting a site survey on April 3.  Calgary and Vancouver </p><p>have changed only slightly, so no survey is necessary.  The </p><p>airports will prepare architectural drawings of all three </p><p>locations showing the preclearance areas for approval by both </p><p>Transport Canada and U.S. agencies. </p><p> </p><p>5. DFAIT explained that it originally designated the </p><p>preclearance areas of all seven airports in May 2002.  DFAIT </p><p>provided copies of floor plans to Embassy Ottawa, accompanied </p><p>by a diplomatic note dated May 8 that explained the drawings. </p><p> The DFAIT note also said, "Preclearance areas of Canadian </p><p>airports will not be set out by regulation but will be </p><p>established administratively through the issuance of a </p><p>document by the Minister of Transport, in consultation with </p><p>the Minister of Foreign Affairs, that designates the </p><p>preclearance areas on an airport-by-airport basis."   The </p><p>Embassy, after consulting with Federal Inspection Agencies, </p><p>responded with a note dated June 5 that acknowledged that the </p><p>preclearance areas described by the GOC  "appear to meet the </p><p>definition of the preclearance area" in the new preclearance </p><p>agreement, which, our note stated, "is not in force as of </p><p>this date."    Nothing in either the DFAIT note or the </p><p>Embassy note made any reference to the designation of the </p><p>preclearance areas as having any bearing on bringing the </p><p>agreement into force.  (Dipnotes faxed to EB/TRA and WHA/CAN.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  DFAIT cites the following sections of the new agreement </p><p>as referring to the process of designating the specific </p><p>locations of the preclearance areas: </p><p> </p><p>Article I, paragraph 1: Definition of the preclearance area; </p><p> </p><p>Article II, paragraph 1: "The host party, before designating </p><p>a preclearance area, shall consult with the participating air </p><p>industry in order to seek their recommendation on the precise </p><p>location of preclearance and in-transit preclearance areas;" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Article II, paragraph 2: "The Host Party shall consult with </p><p>the Inspecting Party with respect to the designation of the </p><p>preclearance area." </p><p> </p><p>GOC said it is consulting with the airports and with the USG </p><p>in accordance with these provisions.  DFAIT said the </p><p>consultation with the USG in the current instance is </p><p>accomplished through both the participation of the </p><p>preclearance staff in Montreal in the site survey on April 3 </p><p>and in a future exchange of notes with the Embassy, as in May </p><p>2002 (para 2). </p><p> </p><p>7.  ECONOFF  asked DFAIT officer how the designations in </p><p>Article II relate to bringing the agreement into force. </p><p>DFAIT responded that Article XII, paragraph 1 says that the </p><p>agreement can be brought into force with an exchange of notes </p><p>"following the completion of all internal procedures of the </p><p>parties."  DFAIT said that the designation process it is </p><p>performing is an "internal procedure" under this provision. </p><p>After the agreement is in effect, DFAIT said, changes in the </p><p>size and location of the preclearance areas would be </p><p>accomplished by a similar consultation and designation </p><p>process, consistent with Articles I and II of the agreement. </p><p> It is necessary, DFAIT maintains, to designate the exact </p><p>preclearance areas where U.S. officers will have authority </p><p>before the agreement goes into effect. </p><p> </p><p>8. Comment: A generous explanation for this bureaucratic </p><p>glitch is that DFAIT and the Privy Council Office (PCO), </p><p>which had pushed to complete the agreement in time for the </p><p>Ridge-Manley meeting April 7, had simply not told Transport </p><p>Canada to ensure that the designations would be accomplished </p><p>according to this schedule.   End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>9. Embassy recommends that we request the GOC agree to an </p><p>exchange of notes giving an entry into force date not later </p><p>than May 12.  This should provide the GOC ample time to meet </p><p>its internal procedure requirements.   Does Washington </p><p>approve such a request and May 12 deadline? </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
