His presentations ranged on topics such as the Harlem </p><p>Renaissance, the role of the U.S. Supreme Court in </p><p>transforming society, affirmative action, legal practices in </p><p>support of social inclusion and the creation of a culture of </p><p>non-violence.  The program was  covered by the national </p><p>medial. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A) Description of the Activity: Dr. Rene Laremont conducted </p><p>a successful four-day speaker program in Honduras giving </p><p>presentations showing by specific, concrete examples how </p><p>civil society in the U.S. brought about social change, the </p><p>important role artists play in a country\'s development, the </p><p>fact that access to power comes through education, and how </p><p>the U.S. legal system has helped transform society.  Dr. </p><p>Laremont also participated in a TV talk show, gave several </p><p>radio interviews, and was guest of honor at a small lunch </p><p>hosted by the APAO with columnist. </p><p> </p><p>B)   Date: July 21-25, 2003 </p><p>     Fiscal year: FY-03, Third Quarter </p><p> </p><p>C) Justification and Objective: To keep audiences focused on </p><p>the importance of listening to communities carefully in </p><p>developing programs of poverty reduction.  In societies like </p><p>Honduras where 80 percent live in poverty, Laremont stressed </p><p>the importance of civil rights, the role of civil society in </p><p>strengthening democracy, and racial and ethnic diversity. </p><p> </p><p>D) Tracker No. 18034; MPP Goals: MPP Theme: Democracy; Human </p><p>Rights, and Mutual Understanding. </p><p>Audience reached:  Approximately 1,200 participants at six </p><p>different conference venues, including representatives of </p><p>the civil society and Garifuna NGOs; academic and cultural </p><p>contacts; members of the Honduran Bar Association; students </p><p>and professors from the law school at the National </p><p>Autonomous University of Honduras; high school students and </p><p>teachers; members of the media and general public.  Dr. </p><p>Laremont\'s appearance on an early morning TV program with </p><p>nationwide audience and impromptu radio interviews reached </p><p>hundreds of thousands more. </p><p> </p><p>E)  Result/Impact: Excellent. </p><p> </p><p>The post fully met its objectives for this program.  Dr. </p><p>Laremont informed national audiences on how the U.S. deals </p><p>with religious, racial and ethnic minorities in a </p><p>multicultural society and the importance of community </p><p>participation in public policies.  Dr. Laremont spoke from </p><p>his numerous investigations and own experience on how </p><p>citizen participation leads to the transformation of </p><p>society. The post had originally requested the speaker </p><p>program to commemorate African-American Heritage Month, but </p><p>postponed it to accommodate to Dr. Laremont\'s schedule.  In </p><p>the meantime, we successfully programmed U.S. filmmaker </p><p>Dennis Watlington for African-American Heritage Month. </p><p> </p><p>On the afternoon of his arrival in Tegucigalpa, Ambassador </p><p>Larry Palmer and the DCM briefed Dr. Laremont on the </p><p>political and social conditions in Honduras.  That evening </p><p>at the National Art Gallery, he initiated his series of </p><p>programs participating in the roundtable discussion "The </p><p>Voice of the Excluded: Harlem, New York: A Case."  He </p><p>discussed how the Afro-Cuban movement and the Harlem </p><p>Renaissance blended in America.  He emphasized the </p><p>importance artists play in forming a national identity and </p><p>their role as political activists.  The program also </p><p>featured Dr. Tulio Mariano Gonzalez, Vice President of the </p><p>National Development Bank and Garifuna leader, and Dr. </p><p>Gloria Lara, cultural anthropologist and former Fulbright </p><p>grantee, as panelists.  The IRC director prepared a </p><p>PowerPoint presentation with audio featuring renowned </p><p>players of the Harlem Renaissance. </p><p> </p><p>The following day, Dr. Laremont participated in the early </p><p>morning national TV program "Frente a Frente" where he </p><p>discussed the role civil society plays in protecting civil </p><p>rights and how the U.S. has promoted an inclusive society. </p><p>The other invited guest was Dr. Ramon Romero, civil society </p><p>advisor to Honduran President Maduro. </p><p> </p><p>On his second program day, Dr. Laremont spoke to a group of </p><p>students and professors of the law school at the National </p><p>Autonomous University of Honduras on how the U.S. Supreme </p><p>Court has dealt with issues of race and class in the 19th </p><p>and 20th centuries.  He expanded on how the social demands </p><p>of the time lead to changes, including new anti-terrorism </p><p>laws in the U.S. That evening, he addressed members of the </p><p>Honduran Bar Association on this topic and referred to </p><p>specific cases where the Supreme Court has been sensible to </p><p>political pressure. CG John Jones also participated and </p><p>invited the Honduran lawyers to take action and see that the </p><p>law protects all Hondurans not just the wealthy and pointed </p><p>to the difference between "immunity" and "impunity." </p><p> </p><p>The following day, Dr. Laremont spoke on "Social Inclusion </p><p>and Legal Structures: Multiculturalism" at a conference co- </p><p>sponsored by the UNDP\'s "Forum for the Strengthening of </p><p>Democracy."  He discussed how nationalism is easy in a </p><p>homogenous society but difficult in countries with different </p><p>ethnic groups and how one can contribute to unite a society. </p><p>He said nationalism doesn\'t have anything to do with the </p><p>economy and that lack of resources is not an excuse to not </p><p>work towards democracy.  He also spoke on the issue of </p><p>voluntary and involuntary migration and how America became a </p><p>diverse society. </p><p> </p><p>That afternoon, Dr. Laremont traveled to La Ceiba on the </p><p>north coast for a program co-sponsored by ODECO, an NGO </p><p>working on the development and empowerment of the Honduran </p><p>Garifuna community. Dr. Laremont met with a group of elders </p><p>at the Garifuna community of Corozal where they discussed </p><p>land-titling problems.  In the evening, he adapted his </p><p>standard presentation to an audience of high school </p><p>students, representatives from the Garifuna community and </p><p>civil society leaders.  He emphasized the need to organize </p><p>communities for any movement to be successful. </p><p> </p><p>The last leg of the program was in San Pedro Sula, Honduras\' </p><p>second largest city and industrial capital, where he was </p><p>guest of honor at a luncheon hosted by the APAO with media </p><p>columnists. In the evening, he gave his presentation on the </p><p>Afro-Cuban movement and the Harlem Renaissance in the nearby </p><p>city of El Progreso.  This program enabled the post to co- </p><p>sponsor an event for the first time with the Cultural </p><p>Foundation of El Progreso. </p><p> </p><p>Throughout his program, Dr. Laremont addressed the issues of </p><p>the role of the civil rights movement in changing laws and </p><p>practices in the U.S. and how the U.S. became a </p><p>multicultural society; how education contributes to build a </p><p>more equalitarian society; how societies can move from </p><p>inclusive practices to exclusive societies; and how Mohandas </p><p>Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. successfully employed non- </p><p>violent means to achieve their goals to make social changes. </p><p> </p><p>The post highly recommends Dr. Laremont for future programs. </p><p>An expert in his field, he invariably adapted his </p><p>presentations to his audience.  His warm personality, fluent </p><p>Spanish, familiarity with the multi-ethnic communities in </p><p>the region enabled him to discuss a wide range of topics </p><p>with his audiences. </p><p> </p><p>F) Non-USG Sources of In-country Funding/In-kind Support and </p><p>Amount: Some of the host institutions provided venues free </p><p>of charge. </p><p> </p><p>G) Quality of U.S. Support and IIP Offices Involved: </p><p>Excellent.  Post would like to thank IIP/T/SV Carmen Aponte </p><p>for proposing Dr. Laremont, who proved to be just the right </p><p>person to meet our program objectives. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
