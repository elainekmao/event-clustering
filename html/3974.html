<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002838 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  BIWEEKLY POLITICAL UPDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This biweekly update for political events in </p><p>Nigeria includes items of interest from recent weeks. </p><p>Topics covered in this edition include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Voter Registration </p><p>-- Political Assassinations </p><p>-- Electoral Bill Override </p><p>-- Grand Summit of Politicians </p><p>-- Miss World Postponed </p><p>-- House Attempts Takeover of Enugu State Assembly </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VOTER REGISTRATION </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Three weeks after the official close of the voters </p><p>registration exercise, the Independent Nigerian Electoral </p><p>Commission (INEC) has yet to address inadequacies in the </p><p>widely-criticized process.  INEC has apparently missed its </p><p>own September 26 deadline for posting the initial voter </p><p>lists at each of more than 120,000 registration sites for </p><p>examination and correction.  Political parties and the GON </p><p>continue to criticize the exercise, but INEC has not </p><p>revealed whether it plans to salvage its results or set a </p><p>timetable for completing the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In ongoing developments of political violence, </p><p>Former Plateau State Minister of Sports Damishi Sango </p><p>alleged that a plot to assassinate him had been uncovered </p><p>in Plateau State.  He based his allegations on threatening </p><p>phone calls which he received giving details of his </p><p>movements and activities.  Damishi claims that the callers </p><p>said they had been hired by his political opponents to </p><p>assassinate him either at his residence or on the highway. </p><p>The case has been handed over to the Plateau Inspector </p><p>General of Police and to the State Security Service. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  Sango is the Alliance for Democracy (AD) </p><p>candidate for governor in Plateau State, one of the states </p><p>in which the AD, traditionally limited to predominately </p><p>southwest Yoruba areas of the country, is looking to expand </p><p>its influence.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Several other politicians, including Abia Governor </p><p>Orji Kalu, Igbo leader Nduku Irabor, and Oyo Governor Lam </p><p>Adesina, also claim to be the targets of similar threats. </p><p>Irabor says that his motorcade was attacked during the </p><p>celebration of Igbo Day, September 29, and Adesina claims </p><p>that one of his security men was paid to assassinate him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ELECTORAL BILL OVERRIDE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  The House of Representatives overrode President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo\'s veto of the 2002 Electoral Bill on </p><p>September 25 by a vote of 191-13.  According to media </p><p>reports, Representatives not voting in favor of the </p><p>override were advised to stay out of the Assembly. </p><p>Nigeria\'s Constitution provides that a quorum of the </p><p>Assembly is required to convene a session and a two-thirds </p><p>vote is necessary to override a veto.  The House of </p><p>Representatives interpreted this as two-thirds of the </p><p>quorum in attendance.  At the same session, Anambra </p><p>Representative Celestine Ughanze, pointing to INEC\'s </p><p>shortcomings in the registration of voters and its Chairman </p><p>Dr. Abel Guobadia\'s comment that holding all elections on </p><p>one day was impossible, said that Guobadia was not fit to </p><p>continue as INEC\'s leader and called for his resignation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  On September 27, the Senate joined the Lower House </p><p>in overriding the President\'s veto of the 2002 Electoral </p><p>Bill.  The Senate voted 48-3 to override the veto while </p><p>four Senators abstained. A counter-motion to stall the vote </p><p>was defeated. Those against the override measure claimed </p><p>the move was both unnecessary and illegal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  Observers question the legality of both </p><p>votes and provisions of the bill have not yet been </p><p>implemented.  Sequencing of the elections is a hotly </p><p>contested political issue.  That could determine electoral </p><p>outcomes.  The Presidency prefers Presidential elections </p><p>first, with others to follow, hoping for a coattail effect </p><p>for the PDP.  The National Assembly advocates elections on </p><p>the same day, hoping to limit Presidential influence.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GRAND SUMMIT OF POLITICIANS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  The October 9 issue of "The Guardian" newspaper </p><p>announced that 106 prominent politicians were convening a </p><p>"Grand Summit" to be held on October 29.  (COMMENT:  The </p><p>list appears to be mostly politicians outside of Obasanjo\'s </p><p>shrinking camp of supporters.  End Comment.)  The purpose </p><p>of the meeting was to find ways to "save Nigeria\'s young </p><p>democracy."  According to the report, Lagos\' Governor Bola </p><p>Tinubu is to convene the summit.  At an October 10 meeting, </p><p>Folurunsho Folarin-Coker, Personal Assistant to the </p><p>Governor, told Lagos CG and P/E Officers that he knew </p><p>nothing about the summit.  Folarin-Coker said that the </p><p>announcement appeared to be an effort to get President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo to call a sovereign national conference. </p><p>For years, Yoruba politicians, supported by some non- </p><p>Yorubas, have been calling for a conference to settle </p><p>crucial questions regarding amendment of the 1999 </p><p>Constitution, allocation of income/revenues from oil and </p><p>gas production, etc.  Folarin-Coker said that, if a summit </p><p>takes place, it will be important to invite the diplomatic </p><p>community to attend and observe in order to guarantee the </p><p>credibility of any outcome. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  COMMENT:  While it is unclear whether this </p><p>meeting will hold as announced, October 29 is also the </p><p>tentative date bruited for the AD\'s National Party </p><p>Convention.  Some activity is underway to prepare for an AD </p><p>convention, but many politicians think that the key to a </p><p>successful electoral strategy lies in not being the first </p><p>to hold a convention.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MISS WORLD POSTPONED </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Organizers of the Miss World beauty pageant </p><p>announced on October 4 that they had postponed the event </p><p>for one week.  The controversy surrounding the staging of </p><p>the pageant in Nigeria continues with commentary from </p><p>Nigeria\'s conservative northern region complaining that </p><p>hosting the pageant is not in keeping with Islamic </p><p>traditions and several contestants refusing to participate </p><p>due to the sentencing to death by stoning of Amina Lawal, </p><p>an unwed mother.  According to the organizers, the change </p><p>was necessary to avoid holding the event during the month </p><p>of Ramadan.  The pageant is now scheduled to take place </p><p>December 7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOUSE ATTEMPTS TAKEOVER OF ENUGU STATE ASSEMBLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  On October 3, the House of Representatives </p><p>adopted a motion, sponsored by Enugu Representative Anayo </p><p>Ede, to give the National Assembly the power to legislate </p><p>for Enugu State, where two different groups of state </p><p>legislators, one supporting Senator (and ex-Governor) Jim </p><p>Nwobodo and the other supporting current Governor Chimaroke </p><p>Nnamani, are at loggerheads over who represents the state. </p><p>In September, members of one of the factions dismissed the </p><p>Assembly Speaker, seized his mace -- the symbol of </p><p>parliamentary authority -- and moved to Abuja.  They </p><p>attempted to hold a parliamentary session in the capital, </p><p>but were halted by police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) On October 8, Nwobodo sponsored a motion in the </p><p>Senate rejecting the move by the House.  According to the </p><p>press, this motion was adopted unanimously by the Senate. </p><p>In addition to Nwobodo\'s self-interest, the move to take </p><p>power from the state legislature, while permitted by the </p><p>Constitution in certain circumstances, raised questions </p><p>among the legislators about what constituted a crisis and </p><p>whether the differences between the two factions could be </p><p>ironed out in a different manner. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
