<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 MONTREAL 000453 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.0. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PGOV, PREL, SMIG, SOCI, CA, Labor </p><p>SUBJECT: Census Data Shows Quebec More Bilingual Since 1996, </p><p>Mostly Due to Montreal Demographics </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This cable was jointly prepared by Montreal and Quebec City </p><p>Consulates. </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: Statistics Canada (Statscan) has released </p><p>several tranches of 2001 census data in the last four months </p><p>regarding language usage and immigration, figures which are </p><p>closely watched in Quebec, by both the media and government. </p><p>The Statscan numbers show Quebec to be 3 percent more </p><p>bilingual than in 1996, but provincial statistics suggest </p><p>that bilingualism is mostly a Montreal area phenomenon.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. Statscan\'s 2001 census data, reveals Montreal was home to </p><p>12 percent of all new immigrants to Canada between 1991 and </p><p>2001.  While Haiti was the top individual country of birth </p><p>for immigrants to Montreal in the 1990s, accounting for 6.6 </p><p>percent or 14,200 of the immigrants arriving during the </p><p>decade, Arab countries were the birth places of 29 percent </p><p>of immigrants who settled in Montreal during the 10-year </p><p>period. Algeria, Lebanon and Morocco were the top three </p><p>countries of origin for immigrants to Montreal.  While </p><p>Quebec as a whole admitted 37,498 immigrants in 2001, a 15 </p><p>percent increase over the previous year, according to the </p><p>provincial Ministry of Citizen Relations and Immigration, </p><p>the provincial capital only received 1,500. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Statscan data also showed Quebec\'s population to be </p><p>40.8 percent bilingual, 3 percent more bilingual than it was </p><p>at the time of the 1996 national census, while French </p><p>language usage in Montreal also inched up.  According to </p><p>Statscan, the 2001 Census data showed that French language </p><p>usage is rising on the island of Montreal, marking the first </p><p>upturn after a 30-year downward spiral.  The proportion of </p><p>Montrealers who speak French at home inched up to 56.4 per </p><p>cent in 2001 from 55.6 percent in 1996.  In comparison the </p><p>Anglophone population in Montreal decreased to 17.7 percent </p><p>in 2001 from 18.9 percent in 1996. </p><p> </p><p>4. Jack Jedwab, executive-director of the Montreal-based </p><p>Association for Canadian Studies, told us there are a number </p><p>of reasons behind the shifts in language usage.  First, he </p><p>believes young Anglophones are continuing to leave the </p><p>province in search of job opportunities where bilingualism </p><p>is not so necessary.  Secondly, more Anglophones are </p><p>marrying into French-speaking families, and adopting French </p><p>as the language used at home.  But most importantly, </p><p>according to Jedwab, there has been a sharp increase in the </p><p>Montreal allophone community\'s usage of French.  (Allophone </p><p>is the term used in Canada to denote someone whose mother </p><p>tongue is neither English nor French.) </p><p> </p><p>5. Statscan said that Allophones in Montreal increased to </p><p>29.1 percent of the population from 27.7 percent in 1996, </p><p>while both the French- and English-mother tongue populations </p><p>decreased accordingly.  Among allophones, usage of French at </p><p>home has increased almost four percent to 20.4 percent in </p><p>2001 from 16.6 percent in 1996.  Meanwhile, the use of </p><p>English at home by allophones dropped slightly from 24.1 </p><p>percent in 1996 to 22.1 percent in 2001.  These numbers </p><p>reflect the fact that in Quebec, children whose parents are </p><p>allophones are required to attend French language schools. </p><p> </p><p>6. Bilingualism is not nearly as widespread in the </p><p>francophone heartland of Quebec, including the capital. </p><p>Institut de la Statistique du Quebec (ISQ) data shows the </p><p>level of bilingualism in Quebec City at only 5.6 percent; </p><p>the provincial capital is 96.7 percent French speaking. </p><p>According to 2001 ISQ figures, 44 percent of the population </p><p>in Northern Quebec is francophone, 3.4 percent is </p><p>anglophone, and 52.6 percent speaks another language, mainly </p><p>Cree or Inuktitut.  With a population of less than 40,000, </p><p>the northern Quebec region (covering three quarters of the </p><p>province\'s land mass) remains first in Quebec in terms of </p><p>the proportion of people whose mother tongue is neither </p><p>French nor English.  Of all the regions, the Saguenay holds </p><p>the highest percentage of population whose maternal language </p><p>is French at 98.6 percent. </p><p> </p><p>7. In Quebec, 50.4 percent of Allophones are able to speak </p><p>both national languages.  But Allophones also continue to </p><p>use their mother tongues.  According to the 2001 census, </p><p>Italian is still the most popular third language spoken in </p><p>real terms, but Arabic saw the most growth.  During the five </p><p>years between 1996 and 2001, the number of Arabic speakers </p><p>increased by 29 percent.  And for the first time, Arab- </p><p>speakers surpassed Spanish-speakers in their numbers in </p><p>Montreal.  The Arab/West Asian minority in Quebec has now </p><p>become the second largest minority after Blacks.  StatsCan </p><p>counted 123,580 persons broadly-defined as Arabs living in </p><p>Montreal in the 2001 census, up from 96,240 in 1996. </p><p>However, the census permits respondents a wide range of </p><p>choices, including "Canadian," in identifying their origins; </p><p>we have seen widely varying estimates on the actual numbers </p><p>of Arab-origin Montrealers. </p><p> </p><p>8. The Quebec government continues to try to attract more </p><p>immigrants and encourages them to establish outside the </p><p>Greater Montreal area. The outgoing PQ Cabinet Minister </p><p>Joseph Facal told us last year the province is trying to </p><p>increase its annual intake of immigrants to 45,000 over the </p><p>next 2-3 years.  Presently, the volume of immigrants living </p><p>outside Montreal is only 15 percent but the aim is to </p><p>increase that level to 25 percent.  Quebec targets </p><p>francophones from North Africa, Europe and Asia; however, </p><p>about half the immigrants who come to the capital are from </p><p>Eastern Europe.  Jobs remain a problem but the Quebec </p><p>authorities are trying to place "visible minorities" in </p><p>government jobs, with a target of 33 percent for new hires </p><p>in Montreal, 25 percent in Quebec City and 8 percent </p><p>elsewhere in the province.  Currently placement is around </p><p>3.4 percent of the province\'s 60,000 civil servants.  The </p><p>further north, the less immigrants: Nunavik (Northern </p><p>Quebec), comprising 55 percent of the entire Quebec </p><p>territory, attracted the least number of newcomers in 2001- </p><p>02 with only 2 immigrants, followed by the North Shore (8), </p><p>and the Gaspe region (13). </p><p> </p><p>9. Quebec immigration recruitment policies do appear to have </p><p>had a positive effect on the increase of French usage in </p><p>Quebec.  The Census revealed that 49 percent of all new </p><p>immigrants to Quebec speak French or English, compared to </p><p>the Canadian average of 39 percent who speak either of the </p><p>two official languages.  However, Alain Jean-Bart, former </p><p>president of S.O.S.-Racisme (the Quebec chapter of the </p><p>international anti-racism group), complained to us that the </p><p>Quebec government selectively recruits Francophone </p><p>immigrants (sidestepping would-be immigrants from West </p><p>Africa, for example) while recruiting so-called </p><p>"francophonisable" peoples in Latin American countries. </p><p>S.O.S. Racisme has worked to counter stereotypical notions </p><p>that Chinese and other immigrants are not francophonisable, </p><p>i.e. not integrating into or contributing to the life of the </p><p>province.  An official from the Ministry of Citizen </p><p>Relations and Immigration recently confirmed that the GOQ </p><p>has focused lately on recruiting immigrants from Argentina </p><p>but he implied that the MRCI is merely exploiting the </p><p>difficult economic situation there to bring skilled, </p><p>educated workers to Quebec. </p><p> </p><p>10. Despite successes in Quebec\'s efforts to attract French </p><p>speakers, Census 2001 revealed that Montreal remains third </p><p>after Toronto and Vancouver in attracting new immigrants. </p><p>Of the 1.8 million immigrants who arrived in Canada during </p><p>the 1991-2001 period, only 12 percent settled in Montreal, </p><p>while 56 percent went to Toronto and 20 percent settled in </p><p>Vancouver.  Quebec continues to have difficulties in </p><p>retaining new immigrants.  Statscan reported a net migration </p><p>loss for Quebec of 57,000 people from 1996 to 2001, </p><p>representing a net loss of 0.9 percent.  While these numbers </p><p>may reflect migration that occurred following the 1995 </p><p>referendum on Quebec independence, the population decrease </p><p>remains surprising given Quebec\'s economic resurgence of </p><p>1999-2001. </p><p> </p><p>11. Quebec had the sixth highest rate among Canadian </p><p>provinces of foreign born residents with 10 percent of its </p><p>population in 2001 born outside Canada.  Quebec also has </p><p>fewer visible minorities - only 7 percent of its population </p><p>-- than the other high-population provinces.  Quebec Premier </p><p>Bernard Landry, commenting on the Statistics data was quoted </p><p>as saying, "Quebec must have more immigrants, for obvious </p><p>reasons.  The land is vast, our natural rate of growth is </p><p>low.  So families, children, people are a priority for us, </p><p>including those families and people coming from </p><p>immigration." </p><p> </p><p>12. The Association for Canadian Studies\' Jedwab believes </p><p>that for Quebec to both attract and keep immigrants, not </p><p>only does the economy have to continue strong, but the GOQ </p><p>needs to find more ways to involve immigrants in civil </p><p>society institutions such as city council, school boards and </p><p>the civil service.  "Give these people [immigrants] a sense </p><p>that they have a meaningful role in Quebec," he says. </p><p>Minister Facal announced last month a plan to hold </p><p>provincial government agencies more accountable for minority </p><p>hiring.  Under the new proposal, Department heads will be </p><p>required to publicize their hiring strategies and report the </p><p>results at legislative hearings. </p><p> </p><p>13. Statistically, Quebec outperforms every other Canadian </p><p>province on bilingualism, with the second closest being New </p><p>Brunswick at 34.2 percent bilingual (the rest of the </p><p>provinces all have bilingual populations less than the </p><p>national average of 17.7 percent).  Quebec\'s rate of </p><p>bilingualism at 41 percent is approaching the Western </p><p>European rate of 47 percent.  As Jedwab points out, "without </p><p>the important numbers of bilingual persons in Quebec, the </p><p>rest of Canada would rank in the lower end of the spectrum </p><p>with the United Kingdom and the U.S." Ironically, </p><p>bilingualism has been a federal, not a provincial goal.  The </p><p>Chretien government\'s recent announcement of a C$751 million </p><p>infusion into French language instruction throughout Canada </p><p>was met mostly with indifference in Quebec. </p><p> </p><p>14. COMMENT: When you look at the political map of Quebec, </p><p>it is the central Quebec, francophone areas that remain the </p><p>most traditional and in the past, most tied to the Parti </p><p>Quebecois.  Our contacts noted that, despite impending </p><p>provincial elections, the release of the 2001 statistics on </p><p>bilingualism did not create the same angst in the Quebec </p><p>media and among politicians as in 1996, when the statistics </p><p>came out a year after the 1995 referendum on independence. </p><p>In fact, Landry has publicly acknowledged that it has become </p><p>a rarity to see an anglophone less than age 50 who does not </p><p>speak French.  While the province is not at the point of </p><p>embracing bilingualism as a goal, even the Parti Quebecois </p><p>realizes that for Quebec to sustain demographic and economic </p><p>growth, the province needs new blood, and not just in </p><p>Montreal.
