<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ABU DHABI 001513 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/RA, NEA/ARP, INR/EC, EB/IEP, EB/CBA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 03/30/13 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PGOV, ENRG, ECON, EINV, IR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  (C) DOLPHIN GAS PROJECT:  STILL NO GAS SALES </p><p>AGREEMENTS AS UAE SHAYKHS WRANGLE OVER PRICING </p><p> </p><p>THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS BUSINESS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION -- </p><p>PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:    Almost one year </p><p>after the selection of U.S. firm Occidental </p><p>Petroleum to assume a 24.5 percent stake in the </p><p>Dolphin project to pump natural gas from Qatar to </p><p>the UAE, actual gas purchase agreements in the </p><p>UAE remain unsigned.  Politics as much as </p><p>business can be blamed for the delay, since an </p><p>actual agreement will depend upon deliberations </p><p>among three top UAE leaders:  Shaykh Muhammad Bin </p><p>Zayid Al-Nahyan (the de facto Defense Minister </p><p>whose Offsets Group owns 51 percent of Dolphin), </p><p>Shaykh Muhammad Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum (de facto </p><p>ruler of Dubai Emirate which expects to buy at </p><p>least half of Dolphin\'s gas) and, perhaps most </p><p>importantly, Shaykh Khalifa Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan </p><p>(the de facto Abu Dhabi ruler who ultimately must </p><p>decide whether and by how much to subsidize </p><p>Dubai\'s gas supply -- and at whose expense).  The </p><p>private sector participants in Dolphin (Oxy and </p><p>TotalFinaElf) are growing increasingly nervous </p><p>about the multi-billion dollar commitments they </p><p>shortly will be called upon to make -- which if </p><p>not backed by supply agreements will represent </p><p>unsecured risks to shareholders.  Offsets </p><p>officials are confident that agreements will be </p><p>forthcoming eventually, but how these deals are </p><p>negotiated and under what terms will bear close </p><p>watching since they will likely provide key </p><p>insights into emerging UAE leadership dynamics. </p><p>END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  WHERE ARE THE SALES CONTRACTS?  Almost </p><p>one year after Occidental replaced the ill-fated </p><p>Enron as a 24.5 percent stakeholder in the 3.5 </p><p>billion USD Dolphin gas project, no sales </p><p>agreements have been signed.  These so-called </p><p>"take or pay" contracts are crucial, since they </p><p>obligate a customer to assume financial liability </p><p>for the gas to be provided.  Without such </p><p>contracts, the participants in the project </p><p>(Occidental is joined by France\'s TotalFina/Elf </p><p>as a 24.5 equity holder and Abu Dhabi\'s Offsets </p><p>Group holds the other 51 percent) could find </p><p>themselves in the position of having built a 3.5 </p><p>billion USD pipeline with no customers -- just a </p><p>huge liability which, at least for the two </p><p>private oil firms, would prove hard to explain to </p><p>shareholders. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMERCIAL TERMS OR SUBSIDIES?  Few here </p><p>doubt that purchase agreements will eventually </p><p>materialize, but timing is at issue.  Basically </p><p>put, the UAE Offsets Group (UOG) and its chief </p><p>patron Shaykh Muhammad Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MBZ - </p><p>- the de facto Defense Minister), seek a </p><p>commercial price for their gas.  That likely will </p><p>not prove a problem in wealthy Abu Dhabi, but </p><p>could be at issue in Dubai, where as much as </p><p>fifty percent of the Dolphin gas is to be </p><p>marketed.  UOG believes a commercial price is </p><p>necessary because it is the only basis upon which </p><p>the private sector participants in the project </p><p>will be able to obtain financing.  However, the </p><p>de facto ruler of Dubai, Shaykh Muhammad Bin </p><p>Rashid Al-Maktoum (MBR), seeks a subsidized gas </p><p>price which will reflect both foregone access to </p><p>cheaper Iranian gas, and the special relationship </p><p>between oil-rich Abu Dhabi and its oil-poor </p><p>northern sibling, Dubai (not to mention MBR\'s </p><p>hopes to buy the gas himself and sell it onward </p><p>to end-users in Dubai at a mark-up, thereby </p><p>generating a nice revenue stream for the Al- </p><p>Maktoum family). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE IRANIAN OPTION:  Dubai\'s gas options </p><p>from Iran would include the close-by Sirri field, </p><p>which while insufficient to meet more than a </p><p>fraction of Dubai\'s needs, would easily be 30-40 </p><p>percent cheaper than market price for Dolphin\'s </p><p>Qatari gas.  Iranian oil officials have also said </p><p>that they could provide larger gas supplies from </p><p>South Pars at "very competitive" rates, although </p><p>it is unclear how much cheaper this gas might be </p><p>than gas from Dolphin.  (Note:  Dolphin struck a </p><p>hard bargain with the Qataris on pricing, but </p><p>this must be balanced by the recognition that the </p><p>Iranians are increasingly hungry for ready </p><p>markets for their growing gas production </p><p>capacity.  End Note.)  MBR has sought through the </p><p>occasional vague public utterance regarding </p><p>Dubai\'s "energy options" to reinforce the message </p><p>-- accurate in our view -- that the decision to </p><p>go with Dolphin gas reflects political (read: Abu </p><p>Dhabi) considerations more than it does </p><p>commercial (read: Dubai) ones. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  THE TWO MUHAMMADS WRANGLE OVER HOW TO </p><p>APPROACH KHALIFA:  Under the circumstances, it </p><p>would appear that both MBZ and MBR have a vested </p><p>interest in securing the agreement of Abu Dhabi </p><p>Crown Prince Khalifa bin Zayid -- who controls </p><p>Abu Dhabi\'s purse strings -- to subsidize </p><p>(probably sub rosa) the gas to be supplied to </p><p>Dubai out of Abu Dhabi\'s large coffers.  But the </p><p>ticklish issue to be addressed is how the two </p><p>Muhammads will agree to a set price/subsidy </p><p>request, and how MBZ\'s elder half-brother Khalifa </p><p>is to be approached.  MBZ, who needs Khalifa\'s </p><p>approval for his many defense projects, is no </p><p>doubt reluctant to go to him on Dolphin, and </p><p>certainly not without MBR in tow.  MBR, from what </p><p>we have heard, is not close to nor well-regarded </p><p>by, the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince.  (Note:  It is </p><p>reliably reported that Shaykh Khalifa recently </p><p>cut Abu Dhabi\'s direct oil subsidy to Dubai, </p><p>citing budgetary pressures.  Oil execs well- </p><p>connected to the Abu Dhabi leadership claim, </p><p>however, that the cut was intended to send the </p><p>signal to MBR that he can no longer end-run </p><p>Khalifa by appealing for assistance directly to </p><p>the aging Shaykh Zayid.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  AFTER YOU MY DEAR ALPHONSE:  Interested </p><p>observers in a position to know suggest that what </p><p>is currently happening is a Shaykhly form of the </p><p>game of "chicken,"  with both MBZ and MBR waiting </p><p>for the other to make the first move (i.e., to </p><p>broach the issue via trusted subordinates).  The </p><p>two enjoy a close but complicated relationship, </p><p>since MBR (as nominal Defense Minister) is both </p><p>theoretically MBZ\'s boss (MBZ\'s official title is </p><p>Armed Forces Chief of Staff) as well as senior to </p><p>him in protocol terms since he is a Crown Prince. </p><p>For MBZ, the higher the price he can get from </p><p>Dubai, the lower the subsidy will be that must be </p><p>asked of Khalifa, while for MBR, the lower the </p><p>price the more Dubai (whose own oil resources are </p><p>rapidly running out) will be able to benefit. </p><p>Yet while this would appear to put the two at </p><p>loggerheads, in a political sense each needs the </p><p>other -- MBZ needs Dubai\'s support for his </p><p>candidacy as possible future Abu Dhabi Crown </p><p>Prince, and MBR needs MBZ\'s support to help </p><p>ensure that Abu Dhabi\'s historical generosity to </p><p>Dubai does not fall off sharply when the more </p><p>fiscally conservative Khalifa succeeds his father </p><p>as Abu Dhabi ruler and likely President of the </p><p>UAE.  Thus, given the sensitivities involved, it </p><p>is unlikely that the two could meet personally to </p><p>resolve the matter until trusted intermediaries </p><p>had first negotiated the deal -- and this does </p><p>not yet appear to have happened. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S)  SHAYKHS WAIT, COMPANIES STEW:  In these </p><p>delicate situations, the usual approach here is </p><p>simply to wait.  MBR is turning up the heat by </p><p>continuing to put it about that Dubai has cheap </p><p>gas alternatives (namely, Iran).  MBZ is having </p><p>the senior Dolphin leadership brief Khalifa on </p><p>the project -- and the briefing will reportedly </p><p>stress the importance of commercial terms (i.e., </p><p>higher gas prices).  Nonetheless, while almost </p><p>all here are sure the situation will ultimately </p><p>resolve itself, Dolphin\'s equity partners worry </p><p>that unless a deal is struck and struck soon, </p><p>they could face the unpleasant task of assuming </p><p>major financial liabilities on the basis of a </p><p>hunch that everything will work out.  We would </p><p>judge that both Occidental and TotalFinaElf would </p><p>in that circumstance swallow hard and forge ahead </p><p>-- they have privately said as much -- but they </p><p>clearly are both hoping that the Shaykhs will be </p><p>able to resolve the matter before it gets to that </p><p>point.  How the ultimate gas sales agreements are </p><p>struck, and under what terms, may provide </p><p>interesting insights into evolving leadership </p><p>dynamics in the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
