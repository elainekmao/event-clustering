<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>MANILA FOR OFDA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Recent Army Successes Against Maoists </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) Kathmandu 1371, B) Kathmandu 964 and previous </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Fifteen Maoists were killed in Dolakha </p><p>district August 3 after security forces, acting on a tip, </p><p>intercepted them making the rounds of a bazaar to collect </p><p>"donations," a Home Ministry official confirmed.  Twelve </p><p>others were killed August 1 after authorities learned of </p><p>their plan to destroy a telecommunications repeater tower </p><p>in a remote area of Dang district.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Army Shuts Down Maoists on Extortion Rounds </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Fifteen Maoists were killed when security forces </p><p>clashed with a group of Nepalese Maoists in Dolakha </p><p>district, about 60 miles northeast of Kathmandu, during </p><p>the early morning hours of August 3, the district\'s Chief </p><p>District Officer (CDO) confirmed to Post.  One Royal </p><p>Nepalese Army (RNA) soldier was wounded.  Acting on a tip, </p><p>security forces confronted the group of fifteen near </p><p>Katakuti village as they were making their regular rounds </p><p>of the market to extort "donations."  One of the dead </p><p>Maoists was reportedly an area commander, a female who </p><p>went by the name "Chetna." </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Attack on Telecom Repeater Foiled </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Also acting on a tip, security forces on August 1 </p><p>foiled an attempt by another group of fifteen Maoists to </p><p>destroy a telephone repeater tower in a jungle area of </p><p>Dang district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Dang\'s </p><p>CDO confirmed.  Twelve Maoists were killed in the </p><p>encounter and explosives were recovered from the scene. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment:  The Maoists staged a sustained campaign </p><p>of attacks on Nepal\'s infrastructure in April and May (Ref </p><p>B), but such actions earned them the animus of many </p><p>villagers--not to mention a lot of bad press--and they </p><p>have since tapered off.  The security forces\' success in </p><p>these incidents suggests that the Maoists have found it </p><p>increasingly difficult to engage in the types of attacks </p><p>they formerly committed with impunity (Ref A).  Moreover, </p><p>the security forces seem to have improved their ability to </p><p>gather information about Maoist movements and put it to </p><p>good use.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
