<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002206 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PRO-GOVERNMENT PAPER URGES SADC EFFORTS IN </p><p>ANGOLA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under the title "Angola peace initiative: Now or </p><p>      never" the independent, pro-government "The Daily </p><p>      Mirror" dedicated its September 30 editorial to urging </p><p>      SADC leaders meeting in Luanda, Angola this week to </p><p>      work towards long-lasting peace in the country. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .SADC leaders meeting in Luanda are being </p><p>      beseeched to realize the urgency and earnest (sic) with </p><p>      which they should treat the issue of bringing about </p><p>      lasting peace to Angola. . .  The tragedy of Africa, </p><p>      willingly or unwittingly, has been to be more than </p><p>      ready to suck itself into meaningless conflicts that </p><p>      would have been sparked by trivial and retrogressive </p><p>      differences.  The West, which to a very large extent </p><p>      gloated on the sidelines and fanned the flames of the </p><p>      wars, has benefited from those conflicts and has not </p><p>      been in a hurry to facilitate a stop to the maiming, </p><p>      raping and killing of brother by brother. . .  Even </p><p>      though in our African way we never celebrate the death </p><p>      of a person no matter how bad that person might have </p><p>      been, it can be said with confidence that the death of </p><p>      Jonas Savimbi early this year removed most of the </p><p>      barriers to the peace seeking process in that country. </p><p>      . .  It is the responsibility of SADC to spread the </p><p>      gospel of peace and to argue for the need to exploit </p><p>      the abundant resources that have for a very long time </p><p>      gone to waste as we spent more time at each other\'s </p><p>      throat." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
