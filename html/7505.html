<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 SANAA 000818 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: SETTING THE STAGE FOR YEMEN,S PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 706 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  The April 27 parliamentary elections </p><p>should be the most competitive elections ever in Yemen.  This </p><p>third parliamentary election in Yemen\'s emerging democracy </p><p>presents a challenge and an opportunity for Yemen to move </p><p>forward.  The potential for violence threatens to mar what </p><p>observers believe will be a mostly free and fair election </p><p>(ref).  Many issues will affect the election\'s outcome, </p><p>including opposition party coordination or lack thereof, poor </p><p>candidate selection, campaign issues, few women candidates </p><p>and effective election observation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Most Competitive Elections Ever, </p><p>Higher Potential for Violence </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Unlike in past elections, little evidence of </p><p>"backroom" coordination between the GPC and Islah parties has </p><p>emerged.  In 1997, the parties negotiated to create "safe" </p><p>constituencies for each other, both because they were running </p><p>in an informal coalition and because they wished to avoid </p><p>violent clashes in high-tension areas.  The Yemeni Socialist </p><p>Party (YSP), former ruling party of pre-unification People\'s </p><p>Democratic Republic of Yemen, is running in this election, </p><p>another major difference from 1997 when they boycotted. </p><p>These two factors mean that the 2003 elections should be the </p><p>most competitive in Yemen ever.  An informal count by </p><p>knowledgeable observers indicates that approximately 120 of </p><p>301 constituencies should be highly competitive "hot" races, </p><p>primarily in Sanaa city and the Aden, Taiz and Hadramaut </p><p>governorates. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The increased competition and resultant tension </p><p>causes many observers to fear increased violence during this </p><p>election period.  Past elections have seen flare-ups of </p><p>violence in random constituencies between political parties </p><p>and between tribes.  In some instances, this violence was the </p><p>result of warring tribes using the elections as "an excuse" </p><p>to continue fighting that has gone on for decades.  In other </p><p>instances, the fighting has flared up because of disputes </p><p>between partisans.  The ROYG, political parties and NGOs have </p><p>made significant efforts in recent months to discuss how to </p><p>combat the possibility of violence, including the signing by </p><p>22 political parties of a Code of Conduct on April 8 </p><p>(septel).  Observers fear, however, that these efforts may </p><p>not be entirely effective as election day approaches even </p><p>with an increased security presence throughout Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Political observers are finding that the heavy </p><p>competition makes predictions of election results difficult. </p><p>A vast majority believe that the GPC will retain its majority </p><p>with little difficulty, but many also see the likelihood of </p><p>the Islah party significantly increasing its number of seats. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Opposition Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The Islah party, YSP and most small opposition </p><p>parties comprise the JMP, which was formed in early 2002 to </p><p>more effectively challenge the ruling GPC.  At several points </p><p>in the last several months, JMP cohesion was threatened.  For </p><p>example, the assassination of YSP leader Jarallah Omar at the </p><p>Islah party conference December 28, 2002 could have caused </p><p>the JMP to break up.  However, in a development that </p><p>surprised many observers, the JMP has managed to remain </p><p>largely coordinated. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  The JMP failed to negotiate which party,s </p><p>candidates would run in which areas in all constituencies. </p><p>Among the largest parties, the YSP gave way to Islah </p><p>candidates in 130 constituencies while Islah gave way to YSP </p><p>candidates in 30 constituencies.  Negotiations with the </p><p>smaller parties in the coalition did not result in many </p><p>agreements.  A majority of the JMP competitive constituencies </p><p>are located in Aden, Hadramaut and Sanaa, areas where the YSP </p><p>and Islah both believed themselves well able to win. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Sheikh al-Ahmar -- "Joint" GPC-Islah Candidate </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Leader of the Islah party and recent Speaker of </p><p>Parliament Sheikh al-Ahmar will run unofficially as a "joint" </p><p>candidate for the GPC and Islah.  Negotiations between the </p><p>GPC and Islah to orchestrate a switch in high positions </p><p>between al-Ahmar and Shura Council Chairman Abdul Ghani </p><p>failed.  These negotiations were fueled by the realization </p><p>that if the GPC retained its majority, it would not make </p><p>sense to re-elect an Islahi because the two parties no longer </p><p>form an informal governing coalition.  At the same time, </p><p>al-Ahmar,s profile and power necessitated a high position in </p><p>the complicated balancing act that is Yemeni politics.  It </p><p>appears that the ROYG and the GPC calculated that, in the </p><p>absence of an agreement to switch, it was prudent to make the </p><p>re-election of al-Ahmar politically feasible by announcing </p><p>him as being supported by both parties.  Al-Ahmar is expected </p><p>to win because the same token opposition candidate that runs </p><p>against him regularly will be his only competition, setting </p><p>the stage for al-Ahmar,s likely re-election as Speaker of </p><p>Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Candidate Choices </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Approximately 1,500 candidates are running in the </p><p>301 constituencies, including political party and independent </p><p>candidates.  This number is significantly lower from past </p><p>elections.  Some observers have blamed the war in Iraq for </p><p>the decrease, alleging that it reduced the number of </p><p>candidates, lowered citizen interest and created </p><p>opportunities for opposition parties to gain votes through </p><p>anti-U.S./ROYG campaigning.    However, the decrease is more </p><p>likely a result of opposition parties coordinating candidates </p><p>and complicated measures by which independent candidates can </p><p>register that decreased their number significantly. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Political observers note that decentralization in </p><p>candidate nomination by the GPC and Islah parties caused </p><p>deterioration in "candidate quality" in some cases and </p><p>lowered the chances for women being nominated.  Many </p><p>candidates are believed to be illiterate and were nominated </p><p>out of local or tribal power centers rather than from among </p><p>the educated. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Presidential son Ahmed Saleh, head of the Yemeni </p><p>Special Forces, did not run again.  A well-traveled joke from </p><p>the last parliament was that its numbers of Members were "300 </p><p>  Ahmed," an indication of what many thought of his </p><p>effectiveness as a Member.  In his constituency, the former </p><p>Mayor of Sanaa is the GPC candidate, someone that many </p><p>believe corrupt. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Active Campaign; Issues </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Halfway through the 19-day official campaign </p><p>period, the election campaign is in full swing.  Campaign </p><p>posters are everywhere, political party newspapers publish </p><p>almost daily and coverage on television and in newspapers is </p><p>widespread.  Political party platforms are published in their </p><p>entirety in official and opposition papers alike.  Concerns </p><p>that the war in Iraq would greatly affect the election -- </p><p>including rumors for several months that the elections would </p><p>be postponed should a war begin -- have dissipated with the </p><p>fall of Saddam\'s regime. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Campaign issues vary, with the most prominent being </p><p>the economy, law and order, and corruption.  In many cases, </p><p>parties seem to run less on specific issues than on candidate </p><p>or leadership personalities and whether they are government </p><p>or opposition.  The issues of U.S.-ROYG counterterrorism </p><p>cooperation and, in relation, the war in Iraq, do not appear </p><p>to be the huge issues that the ROYG and ruling GPC feared. </p><p>Nevertheless, political observers believe that these issues, </p><p>with an attendant flavor of an "American fight against </p><p>Islam," will increase the Islah party vote. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Few Women Candidates </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  In what many consider the biggest disappointment of </p><p>the run-up to the election, only 11 women are running for </p><p>election.  They represent four political parties, including </p><p>GPC and YSP, and include five independents.  Not only has </p><p>Yemen allowed universal suffrage since 1993 (the first on the </p><p>Arabian Peninsula), but both parliaments in 1993 and 1997 had </p><p>women Members.  Some observers and political parties fear </p><p>that no women will be elected this time and Yemen will </p><p>backslide in its women,s representation. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Several domestic and international NGOs and some </p><p>political parties had advocated for either a formal or </p><p>informal "set-aside" for women candidates to ensure at least </p><p>10 percent representation.  Ideas included parties informally </p><p>agreeing to run only women in 30 selected constituencies and </p><p>a formal last-minute change in the election law to mandate </p><p>"women,s constituencies."  Several problems caused the low </p><p>number of women candidates, including a decision by the Islah </p><p>that they would lose a large part of their base should they </p><p>run women, decentralization in candidate selection that left </p><p>central party bodies without the ability to place women </p><p>candidates, increased competition that caused parties to be </p><p>reluctant to run women they thought might be weaker </p><p>candidates than men and a traditional male-dominated society. </p><p> A formal resolution in the election law was not feasible </p><p>before the election, and many are discussing the possibility </p><p>of raising the issue after the election. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Election Observation </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  The National Democratic Institute for International </p><p>Affairs (NDI) is fielding the only official international </p><p>observation delegation.   30 delegates from 10 countries, </p><p>including several in the Middle East, will observe.  More </p><p>than 30,000 domestic election observers are registered as </p><p>well, including between 6-10,000 NDI-trained observers.  The </p><p>Embassy plans to informally observe the elections.  Details </p><p>on observation septel. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
