(SBU)  SUMMARY: Embassy Amman submits the following case </p><p>for bureau consideration.  Per instructions REFTEL, post </p><p>notes that the case involves a U.S. company that purchased a </p><p>non-U.S. company with an outstanding claim.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>CASE DESCRIPTION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Claimant A is an American company that acquired a </p><p>UK-based engineering and design company in 2001.  The UK </p><p>company had been hired by Claimant B (52% owned by the GOJ) </p><p>in 1995 and in 1997 to design and supervise the construction </p><p>of three earthen dikes, designated Dike A, Dike B, and Dike </p><p>C, for Claimant B.  In March, 2000, a large portion of Dike B </p><p>collapsed, a collapse that Claimant A attributed to factors </p><p>unrelated to the dike\'s design.  As a consequence of the </p><p>collapse, Claimant B asked Claimant A to investigate the </p><p>safety of Dike A in March, 2001.  In the course of its </p><p>investigation, Claimant A discovered unacceptably strains on </p><p>the dike and put in place urgent remedial measures to keep </p><p>the dike safe pending a longer-term strategy for restoring </p><p>the dike to normal operation.  Claimant A requested payment </p><p>of GBP90,000 ($55000) from Claimant B for the remedial work. </p><p>Claimant B asserted that any payment to Claimant A was offset </p><p>by damages of JD37 million ($26 million) for the collapse of </p><p>Dike B. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>STATUS OF DISPUTE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Claimant A, citing the British-Jordanian Bilateral </p><p>Investment Treaty, registered its dispute with the Jordanian </p><p>Government (as majority owner of Claimant B) with the </p><p>International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes </p><p>(ICSID) in September, 2002 for arbitration.  The Jordanian </p><p>Government said that Claimant B is a commercial business </p><p>rather than a government entity and that, as such, the </p><p>dispute does not involve the GOJ and thus is not a matter for </p><p>ICSID consideration.  An ICSID tribunal has been constituted, </p><p>and ICSID will decide whether it has jurisdiction after a </p><p>hearing set for February 3, 2004. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Claimant B initiated proceedings against Claimant A </p><p>in the Jordanian Court of First Instance in November, 2002, </p><p>claiming the damages cited above.  Claimant A challenged the </p><p>jurisdiction of Jordanian courts in the dispute and said </p><p>that, given ICSID acceptance of the case, current Jordanian </p><p>court proceedings should be discontinued.  The Jordanian </p><p>Court is expected to issue a ruling o/a June 12. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>IDENTITY OF CLAIMANTS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Claimant A is U.S.-based Jacobs Engineering. </p><p>Claimant B is the Arab Potash Corporation (APC). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
