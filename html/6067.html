<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001251 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR CASLO </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA -- WON CHANG </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p>CINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, EFIN, MOPS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ROYAL JORDANIAN WAR CONTINGENCY PLAN </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Summary.  Royal Jordanian Airlines plans to </p><p>shuttle passengers between Amman and a temporary </p><p>operating hub in Athens in the event civil air traffic to </p><p>Amman\'s Queen Alia airport is closed by a military </p><p>conflict and/or lack of affordable insurance coverage. </p><p>This scenario could have a major, potentially fatal, </p><p>financial impact on the airline, which until recently had </p><p>been fairly successful in putting its accounts back in </p><p>order after excesses in the 1980s.  Post would appreciate </p><p>guidance on the CEO\'s questions about if there are ways </p><p>Fly America and participation in the U.S. Civil Reserve </p><p>Air Fleet could be used to make up for some of the </p><p>business the airline would lose in a war.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>ATHENS-BASED TEMPORARY OPERATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Royal Jordanian (RJ) CEO Samer Majali and </p><p>Civil Aviation Authority officials said RJ hopes to be </p><p>able to continue normal operations for as long as </p><p>possible in the lead-up to a possible military conflict. </p><p>But the airline has drafted a contingency plan -- the </p><p>outlines of which have been sketched in the local press </p><p>-- that assumes that at some point it will become </p><p>impossible to operate RJ\'s 15-plane fleet out of Amman </p><p>because of military airspace restrictions or because </p><p>insurers are no longer willing to cover the war risk. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  RJ has agreed with Athens airport that if </p><p>necessary, RJ\'s fleet and operations would be based in </p><p>Athens.  Assuming that western Jordanian airspace remains </p><p>open (as it was in 1991) RJ\'s two self-owned A320\'s (the </p><p>remainder of the passenger fleet is leased) would be used </p><p>to shuttle passengers from Amman to the new Athens hub. </p><p>The airline and its owner, the government of Jordan, </p><p>would assume the insurance risk if no or only limited </p><p>affordable commercial cover is available.  Otherwise, </p><p>flights would operate out of Athens as if from Amman, </p><p>including the new non-stop service to New York.  Majali </p><p>and CAA also believe that they have reached agreement </p><p>with Israeli authorities that would permit continued RJ </p><p>overflights of Israel, although the routing might be </p><p>shifted further away from population centers. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING FINANCIAL IMPACT </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Majali said the financial impact on the </p><p>airline of such a scenario would be devastating.  March </p><p>and April reservations are already down over 40% from </p><p>year ago levels.  The cost would be even higher if planes </p><p>are caught on the ground in areas with closed airspace </p><p>(such as Kuwait or Baghdad).  Majali was not optimistic </p><p>about the airline\'s prospects after a conflict, expecting </p><p>that European airlines would beat RJ to the punch in </p><p>starting Baghdad service.  Thus, he expected that the </p><p>airline -- which has recently been established as a </p><p>supposedly self-sustaining company in hopes of </p><p>privatization -- would likely have to call on significant </p><p>government support in order to keep flying.  (Comment: </p><p>RJ currently receives a low level of budget transfers </p><p>from the GOJ, as well as subsidized jet fuel, and </p><p>maintains a large debt to the refinery company.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>LOOKING FOR USG BUSINESS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Majali noted the airline\'s experience in </p><p>operating throughout the region, including to all of </p><p>Iraq\'s major airports, and hoped that the U.S. government </p><p>would find ways to take advantage of this as well as RJ\'s </p><p>expected excess capacity during and after a conflict. </p><p>For instance, he said he continued to work hard to find a </p><p>U.S. codeshare partner that would allow RJ to carry USG </p><p>passengers, and asked if the U.S. had any flexibility on </p><p>Fly America provisions.  Also noting that the Civil </p><p>Reserve Airline Fleet (CRAF) had recently been activated, </p><p>he asked if there were ways to use RJ capacity for </p><p>military purposes.  He said that he had been in touch </p><p>with the UN about participating in possible relief </p><p>operations. </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT AND GUIDANCE REQUEST </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  We would appreciate Washington guidance on </p><p>Majali\'s questions about Fly America and participating in </p><p>CRAF support.  Although the airline\'s financial situation </p><p>had been improving over the past year, a conflict would </p><p>undoubtedly be a serious blow to its viability.  This </p><p>would require the government to decide how much it wants </p><p>to continue to pay to support its only national flag </p><p>carrier, or shut it down. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
