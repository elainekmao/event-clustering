<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BOGOTA 010967 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR ARA/AND, INL, DRL </p><p>NSC FOR JAMES DOBBINS </p><p>SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p>USIA FOR AR, I/GAR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 11/08/01 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MARR, PINR, PHUM, CO </p><p>SUBJECT:  FARC DESERTER CLAIMS 30 CAPTURED SOLDIERS DEAD </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECONOFF S.K. ABEYTA.  REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  A FARC DESERTER HAS REPORTED THAT 30 OF THE 60 COLOMBIAN </p><p>SOLDIERS CAPTURED BY THE FARC ARE DEAD.  ALTHOUGH THE REPORT </p><p>COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED, THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE INDICATED THE GOC </p><p>WILL USE THIS INFORMATION IN AN EFFORT TO CAPITALIZE ON ADVERSE </p><p>PUBLICITY ON THE FARC.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>FARC DESERTER REPORTS 30 CAPTURED SOLIDERS DEAD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  DURING A BRIEF MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR NOVEMBER 7, </p><p>MINISTER OF DEFENSE ESGUERRA PRESENTED A COPY OF A FAX SENT TO </p><p>THE DIRECTOR OF CM&, A COLOMBIAN TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAM, BY AN </p><p>INDIVIDUAL CLAIMING TO HAVE RECENTLY DESERTED FROM THE FARC. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THIS INDIVIDUAL, SOME 30 OF THE 60 COLOMBIAN ARMY </p><p>SOLDIERS CAPTURED AT LAS DELICIAS AUGUST 30 ARE DEAD -- SOME DIED </p><p>OF WOUNDS, OTHERS WERE EXECUTED WHEN THEY TRIED TO ESCAPE, AND </p><p>STILL OTHERS DIED OF MALARIA.  THE FARC DESERTER CONTINUES TO SAY </p><p>THE FARC LEADERSHIP IS AT A LOSS TO JUSTIFY THE DEATHS OF THOSE </p><p>SOLDIERS AND THEREFORE IS DELAYING THE RELEASE OF THE OTHERS </p><p>CAPTURED IN EXPECTATION OF AN EVENTUAL ARMED CONFRONTATION WITH </p><p>THE COLOMBIAN ARMY.  THE FARC WOULD THEN CLAIM THE 30 DEAD </p><p>SOLDIERS WERE CASUALTIES OF THAT CONFRONTATION AND BLAME THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR DEATHS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ESGUERRA WAS CLEARLY EAGER TO PASS ON THIS INFORMATION, </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT YET CONFIRMED THE LETTER\'S AUTHENTICITY.  NOR </p><p>HAD HE ASKED HIMSELF SOME OBVIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS CONTENT -- </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, HOW THE FARC EXPECTED TO PASS OFF AS RECENT COMBAT </p><p>CASUALTIES THE CADAVERS OF SOLDIERS LONG DEAD.  IF TRUE, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE CAPTIVE SOLDIERS\' DEATHS WILL HAVE SEVERE REPERCUSSIONS. THE </p><p>MOD UNDERSTANDABLY WANTS TO CAPITALIZE ON ADVERSE PUBLICITY ABOUT </p><p>THE FARC AND ITS CYNICAL TACTICS TO DELAY HANDING OVER THE </p><p>SOLDIERS IT MADE A GREAT SHOW OF PROMISING TO RELEASE WITHIN A </p><p>WEEK OF THE LAS DELICIAS ATTACK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FRECHETTE </p><p></p></div>
