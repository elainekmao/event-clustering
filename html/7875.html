Akashi also gave the Tigers one </p><p>week to make a final decision on whether they will </p><p>attend the June donors conference in Tokyo.  Prabhakaran </p><p>was noncommittal, although he indicated the Tigers would </p><p>be cooperative if the GSL met their long-standing </p><p>demands re assistance and security.  At this point, it\'s </p><p>not clear what the Tigers will do, but they seem to have </p><p>climbed down somewhat from their previous hard-line </p><p>positioning.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) MEETING PRABHAKARAN:  A Japanese government </p><p>delegation led by Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi met with </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leader V. </p><p>Prabhakaran on May 7.  The meeting took place in the </p><p>LTTE-controlled town of Kilinochchi in northern Sri </p><p>Lanka.  A large Japanese team, which included Ambassador </p><p>to Sri Lanka Seiichiro Otsuka, participated in the </p><p>meeting.  Visiting London-based LTTE spokesman Anton </p><p>Balasingham, political chief S.P. Thamilchelvam, and J. </p><p>Maheswaran, an Australia-based LTTE official, also </p><p>attended the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) JAPANESE READOUT:  Ambassador Otsuka provided </p><p>Ambassador Wills a readout of the Kilinochchi talks </p><p>early May 8.  Otsuka said the two-hour meeting was "very </p><p>cordial and not at all confrontational."  In terms of </p><p>substance, he noted that while it was "good", it was not </p><p>"conclusive" in that the LTTE had not agreed to return </p><p>to the peace talks and to attend the June donors </p><p>conference in Tokyo.  Otsuka noted that Akashi had </p><p>pressed these issues twice and received essentially </p><p>noncommittal responses both times.  Akashi had also </p><p>pressed Prabhakaran on other issues, such as human </p><p>rights.  In addition, he had urged the Tigers to return </p><p>to the Sub-Committee for Immediate Humanitarian and </p><p>Rehabilitation Needs in the North and East (SIHRN). </p><p>(Note:  The Tigers pulled out of this joint committee </p><p>late last month.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Otsuka said Prabhakaran, who rarely meets with </p><p>foreigners, listened intently to all of Akashi\'s points. </p><p>In his comments, Prabhakaran stressed that progress had </p><p>not been made in the delivery of humanitarian and </p><p>developmental assistance because the SIHRN committee was </p><p>"not efficient."  He also complained that the North/East </p><p>Reconstruction Fund (NERF) was not yet operating and </p><p>funding projects.  Prabhakaran went on to touch on long- </p><p>standing LTTE concerns about Tamil displaced persons </p><p>related to the issue of the military presence in Jaffna </p><p>District (see more below in Para 8).  Despite his </p><p>noncommittal reaction, Prabhakaran did not fully </p><p>discount the possibility that the Tigers would </p><p>eventually come back to the talks and decide to attend </p><p>the Tokyo meeting.  He did, however, make very clear </p><p>that there had to be progress on issues of Tiger concern </p><p>before the group would do so.  Akashi emphasized that </p><p>the Tigers had one week to decide whether or not they </p><p>were coming to Tokyo. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Sharing a small vignette, Otsuka related that </p><p>the Japanese side had brought along its own interpreter </p><p>to the meeting.  (Note:  Most visitors in meetings with </p><p>the LTTE rely on the group\'s interpreter who is named </p><p>"George."  George has often been accused of spinning his </p><p>translations.)  After the meeting, the GoJ interpreter </p><p>told Otsuka that at one point Balasingham had said, "We </p><p>suspended the peace talks to get concessions." (Note: </p><p>This statement tends to highlight the tactical nature of </p><p>the LTTE\'s recent moves.)  In another vignette, Otsuka </p><p>commented that Prabhakaran had told him during the more </p><p>social atmosphere of the lunch following the meeting </p><p>that his son, Charles Anthony, was studying martial </p><p>arts.  A lively discussion on the matter ensued when </p><p>Otsuka noted that he had a brown belt in karate.  (Note: </p><p>Charles Anthony, who is believed to be in London, is </p><p>approximately 17 years old.  Prabhakaran is believed to </p><p>have another son and one daughter with him at his key </p><p>base in Mullaitivu in northeast Sri Lanka.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) (((Note:  In other peace process news:  early </p><p>May 8 the pro-LTTE website "TamilNet" posted an article </p><p>on the Akashi-Prabhakaran meeting complete with several </p><p>photos.  The article was relatively upbeat and its </p><p>substance largely jibed with Otsuka\'s readout.  The </p><p>article noted that at the close of the meeting </p><p>Prabhakaran had given Akashi a "Tamil Eelam" map and </p><p>insignia.))) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) (((Note:  Following up Deputy Foreign Minister </p><p>Helgesen\'s recent visit and the latest efforts by the </p><p>Japanese, Norwegian Special Envoy Erik Solheim is slated </p><p>to meet Balasingham in the Wanni on May 8.  Solheim\'s </p><p>brief is believed to be identical to Helgesen\'s and </p><p>Akashi\'s, i.e., try to convince the Tigers to come back </p><p>to the talks and attend the June donors conference.))) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) (((Note:  In another peace process development, </p><p>Defense Minister Marapana announced May 7 that the GSL </p><p>was planning a large-scale reorganization of its forces </p><p>in Jaffna District.  The idea behind the reorganization </p><p>would be to amalgamate forces in Jaffna, and, thus, </p><p>permit more civilian land use.  The plan is clearly </p><p>meant to appease the Tigers, who have long claimed that </p><p>the military\'s bases in Jaffna - especially the so- </p><p>called "high security zones" there - are too large.  See </p><p>DATT\'s Septel re the GSL proposal and the military\'s </p><p>reaction to it.))) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  The Norwegians and the Japanese have </p><p>certainly been giving it their all in working to </p><p>convince the Tigers to return to the negotiating track. </p><p>There seems to be some movement by the Tigers in that </p><p>they appear to have climbed down somewhat from their </p><p>previous hard-line positioning.  The group, for example, </p><p>has re-opened lines of communication and adopted a less </p><p>shrill tone.  In fact, the U.S. can take some credit for </p><p>this shift, as the Tigers\' move toward a more moderate </p><p>posture dates from their response to the U.S. statement </p><p>on their pullout from the talks.  (Note:  In other </p><p>potentially positive news, we understand that FCO </p><p>officials had a good give-and-take with Balasingham on </p><p>May 4 just before he came to Sri Lanka.  In their </p><p>previous attempt to meet with him, Balasingham had </p><p>rudely told them he did not want to talk.)  All that </p><p>said, it\'s still not clear what the Tigers plan to do </p><p>and whether they will be back in the ballgame soon.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
