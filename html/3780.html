(U) SUMMARY: The Zimbabwe executive office issued a </p><p>directive, circulated as a diplomatic note on 13 September, </p><p>putatively intended to rein in over-zealous government </p><p>officials in their acquisition of land. An independent press </p><p>report, supported by the diplomatic note, and comments by </p><p>Speaker of the Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa, exposed the </p><p>lack of control the ZANU-PF leadership has exercised over the </p><p>distribution of land.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>ZANU-PF LEADERSHIP LITTLE CONTROL OVER PROCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>2.  (U) In response to the actions of some of its party </p><p>members over land acquisitions, the ZANU-PF executive office </p><p>issued a directive to the Cabinet.  The problems are with </p><p>some farmers losing their only farms and some ZANU-PF </p><p>officials obtaining more than one farm.  The Embassy received </p><p>a copy of a diplomatic note issued by the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs on September 13 from the Norwegian Embassy.  The </p><p>diplomatic note subtly stated that Acting President Simon </p><p>Muzenda had issued a directive to government officials that </p><p>they must adhere to the one man-one farm policy.  The </p><p>directive also stated that even Zimbabwean farmers of </p><p>European descent are entitled to one farm, and that </p><p>deviations from official policy must be discontinued. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) A Financial Gazette article on 19 September </p><p>highlighted the extent of the lack of control the ZANU-PF </p><p>leadership has had over the land process.  According to the </p><p>article, ZANU-PF parliamentarians, cabinet members, and </p><p>Politburo members have been defying President Mugabe,s </p><p>directive of one man-one farm by capitalizing on white </p><p>farmers, need for up-front cash and by creating black-owned </p><p>agricultural companies as fronts for acquiring multiple </p><p>farms.  Representatives from the agricultural firms approach </p><p>farmers whose property has been listed and offer to buy the </p><p>properties promptly as an alternative to waiting for </p><p>government compensation.  The businessmen and ZANU-PF </p><p>politicians then facilitate the de-listing of these </p><p>properties because they are in the hands of blacks. </p><p>According to the article, more than 20 white-owned farms have </p><p>been acquired in this manner. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Senior ZANU-PF Politburo member and Speaker of the </p><p>Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa, in a September 19 meeting with </p><p>the Ambassador, expressed befuddlement over why the process </p><p>was so chaotic in Mashonaland and Matabeleland North.  He </p><p>commented that the policy is so clear--one man-one farm--that </p><p>he cannot understand why people violate it and acquire more </p><p>than one farm, or why some farmers were being left landless. </p><p>The only rationale he offered for the situation was that the </p><p>land is so rich people are just scrambling for it. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>LAND REDISTRIBUTION WINDING DOWN </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>5.  (U) Also in the September 19 meeting, Mnangagwa said the </p><p>land acquisition exercise was winding down and at the end of </p><p>it all the government will have acquired between 10.6 and </p><p>10.8 million hectares of land.  He insisted that most of the </p><p>current problems with farms were occurring in Mashonaland and </p><p>Matabeleland North and not in his province of Midlands or in </p><p>Manicaland.  He also claimed that land acquisition was </p><p>complete in Midlands and Manicaland with most of the </p><p>infrastructure still intact.  For example, in Midlands, 311 </p><p>of the original 324 commercial farmers have remained and are </p><p>providing assistance to newly settled farmers so production </p><p>will not be reduced significantly.  Mnangagwa said of the 13 </p><p>who left, two were elderly couples whose children were living </p><p>abroad.  He said the government assisted them in disposing of </p><p>their farms.  Nine of the 13 farmers were not happy with the </p><p>reduced farm sizes (from 5000 ha to 2000 ha) and opted to </p><p>leave. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: The diplomatic note, Financial gazette </p><p>article, and Mnangagwa,s musings about the chaotic land </p><p>process suggest that the senior ZANU-PF leadership have had </p><p>little control over the land redistribution process or are </p><p>trying to convey this impression in order to avoid blame for </p><p>the disastrous consequences.  The dip note is surprising in </p><p>that the GOZ has not generally reprimanded its party members </p><p>for their actions related to land policy.  Its circulation on </p><p>the eve of the Commonwealth Troika meeting suggests a cynical </p><p>ploy to acknowledge that the commitments made at the </p><p>September 2001 Abuja meetings and in Mugabe\'s recent speeches </p><p>have not been met, while showing what to do better.  It could </p><p>be also part of a longer term plan to get international aid </p><p>by showing that they are pursuing members who abuse their </p><p>privileges with respect to land.  Whatever the motives, the </p><p>GOZ has clearly encouraged chaos intended to drive commercial </p><p>farmers off the land and has made minimal or no effort to </p><p>control abuses at odds with their own commitments. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
