President George W. Bush\'s visit to Africa continues </p><p>      to make headlines in the local print and electronic media. </p><p>      While the independent press is casting the visit in </p><p>      positive light, the government-controlled print and </p><p>      electronic media is denouncing the whistle stop tour of </p><p>      Africa as inconsequential.  The government-controlled daily </p><p>      "The Herald" and the state-run radio and television </p><p>      station, ZTV, have dispatched reporters to cover President </p><p>      Bush\'s visit to South Africa.  The July 8 main news </p><p>      bulletin at 2000 hours on ZTV One made the Bush visit its </p><p>      top story.  The story included a live telephone interview </p><p>      with the organization\'s Chief Reporter Reuben Barwe in </p><p>      Pretoria, who gave a brief synopsis of President Bush\'s </p><p>      visit to South Africa.  Barwe\'s interview was followed by </p><p>      another live studio interview with a political analyst, </p><p>      William Nhara, who said President Bush "is welcome" for as </p><p>      long as he is here "to strengthening existing economic </p><p>      ties" and "does not meddle in the internal affairs of other </p><p>      countries."  Since yesterday, President Bush\'s visit is </p><p>      dominating news bulletins on all the four radio stations </p><p>      broadcast in English and the two major indigenous languages </p><p>      - Shona and Ndebele. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   The lead stories in the July 9 editions of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" and the </p><p>      independent daily "The Daily News" focus on </p><p>      President Bush\'s visit to South Africa.  Article </p><p>      excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>      Under headline "Uproar over Bush\'s visit" the </p><p>      "Herald" carried the following stories under sub- </p><p>      headline: "Mbeki imperialist says MDC": </p><p> </p><p>      "In a desperate attempt to attract international </p><p>      attention to coincide with U. S. President George W. </p><p>      Bush\'s visit to Africa, MDC supporters yesterday </p><p>      held an illegal demonstration in Harare denouncing </p><p>      South African President Thabo Mbeki as an </p><p>      imperialist. . .About 30 MDC demonstrators handed </p><p>      over a petition to the U. S. Embassy in Harare.  The </p><p>      petition labels Mr. Mbeki an `imperialist\' who wants </p><p>      to see Zimbabwe `perpetually weak so as not to pose </p><p>      a threat to his own country.\'  They ran and chanted </p><p>      along the streets carrying placards reading `Mugabe </p><p>      step down\' and `We want a transitional government </p><p>      now.\'  `President Mbeki has indeed lost the moral </p><p>      authority to mediate in the Zimbabwe crisis,\' read </p><p>      part of the petition.  Zimbabwe cannot continue to </p><p>      suffer because of President Mbeki\'s imperialist </p><p>      ambitions. . . .\'" </p><p> </p><p>      Under the sub-headline "U. S. demands on Zim </p><p>      impossible - media" the "Herald" carried the </p><p>      following article by Itayi Musengeyi in Pretoria, </p><p>      South Africa: </p><p> </p><p>      "U. S. President George W. Bush was due to arrive </p><p>      here late last night, amid South African media </p><p>      reports that Pretoria would tell him that his </p><p>      demands on Zimbabwe are impossible.  Speculation was </p><p>      rife in the media that Zimbabwe would feature in </p><p>      talks between Mr. Bush and his SA counterpart </p><p>      President Thabo Mbeki following recent </p><p>      pronouncements by Washington that Harare should hold </p><p>      fresh Presidential elections. . . ."  The article </p><p>      then proceeded to quote press reports from several </p><p>      Johannesburg-based newspapers and radio stations. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Anti-Mbeki demo foiled" the </p><p>      independent daily "The Daily News" (07/09) carried the </p><p>      following lead story by Angela Makamure: </p><p> </p><p>      "Several people were assaulted in Harare yesterday </p><p>      and two arrested when riot police put down a </p><p>      demonstration against South African President Thabo </p><p>      Mbeki and Zimbabwe\'s President Robert Mugabe on the </p><p>      eve of a visit to Pretoria by U. S. leader George W. </p><p>      Bush.  Demonstrators numbering about 3,000 marched </p><p>      through the streets of the capital city\'s central </p><p>      business district, carrying placards denouncing </p><p>      Mbeki\'s policy pf `quiet diplomacy\' on the crisis in </p><p>      Zimbabwe. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Post will fax the full text of the articles ASAP. </p><p> </p><p>SILLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
