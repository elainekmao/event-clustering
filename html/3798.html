<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP, EB </p><p>COMMERCE PASS ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY PASS OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>CINCPAC PASS FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, EINV, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: PREMIER DIVESTS, PETRONAS DIGS IN </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 1053 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM RONALD MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Premier Oil\'s decision to pull up stakes here </p><p>seems based more on financial necessity than the pressure of </p><p>boycotts.  Petronas, Premier\'s partial owner and business </p><p>partner in Burma, agreed to sell back its shares in Premier </p><p>in exchange for the British firm\'s position in the Yetagun </p><p>gas field, worth about $150 million.  This makes eminent </p><p>sense considering the Malaysian state-run oil firm\'s desire </p><p>to solidify its already influential position in Burma\'s up- </p><p>and down-stream energy markets.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Premier\'s Loss, Petronas\' Gain </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Premier Oil\'s announcement on September 15 that it </p><p>would sell its shares in the offshore Yetagun gas field came </p><p>as no surprise to local energy industry sources.  According </p><p>to one western oil man, Premier, a relatively small </p><p>independent energy producer, had "bitten off more than it </p><p>could chew" in operating the Yetagun field.  He speculated </p><p>that Premier\'s operating partners -- notably Malaysia\'s </p><p>Petronas and Thailand\'s PTT -- were increasingly unhappy with </p><p>the way Premier was operating the field.  In addition, </p><p>difficulties working with the local government increased the </p><p>operating costs of the Yetagun field. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) These comments tally with Premier\'s assertion that </p><p>it liquidated its position here to reduce overall company </p><p>debt levels, to focus on other core investments, and to rid </p><p>itself of the 25 percent foreign ownership (by Malaysia\'s </p><p>Petronas and Amerada-Hess from the United States) that had </p><p>made outside acquisition -- a stated Premier objective -- </p><p>unlikely.  Industry sources here say that the complexities of </p><p>unwinding Premier\'s investment, and the transfer of </p><p>operations to Petronas, will likely keep the British firm </p><p>here until after November. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Petronas was more than happy to buy out its </p><p>erstwhile partner.  The Malaysian energy parastatal will </p><p>become the field\'s operator after absorbing Premier\'s 26.7 </p><p>percent share in Yetagun, upping to nearly 60 percent </p><p>Petronas\' total stake in the $600 million investment.  This </p><p>acquisition fits well with other evidence that Petronas is </p><p>here for the long haul.  Aside from holding a majority stake </p><p>in Yetagun, Petronas also recently inked understandings with </p><p>the Burmese government to survey and possibly develop 4 </p><p>blocks near the Yetagun field. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Petronas is also heavily involved in the downstream </p><p>side of the energy game here in Burma, despite the economic </p><p>hazards.  A top-level Petronas official told us that the </p><p>company has, for four years, held the sole supply contract of </p><p>petroleum and diesel fuel oil for the Ministry of Gas and </p><p>Energy -- though the military\'s Myanmar Economic Holdings </p><p>Limited also imports quantities of diesel fuel for domestic </p><p>consumption.  This $200 million a year deal is paid 50 </p><p>percent cash and 50 percent in agricultural products, with a </p><p>year\'s credit for all payments.  These are extremely generous </p><p>terms, considering the Burmese government\'s chronic foreign </p><p>exchange shortage.  Nevertheless, Petronas has made them work </p><p>out, at least thus far. </p><p> </p><p>Government\'s Reaction: Huh? </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) One sad anecdote, which speaks volumes of the </p><p>country\'s dismal investment climate, came during a courtesy </p><p>call to the Ministry of National Planning and Economic </p><p>Development\'s Directorate for Investment and Company </p><p>Administration -- the main contact for foreign investors. </p><p>During the course of our conversation with the Deputy </p><p>Director General we asked for the government\'s reaction to </p><p>the news reports of Premier\'s decision.  Blank, embarrassed, </p><p>stares indicated that the news of the $150 million investment </p><p>shuffle had not yet trickled down to the office which must </p><p>"approve" such decisions. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) We think the international divestment lobby played no </p><p>more than an incidental role in Premier\'s decision.  From all </p><p>we have heard, it was simply a business move.  On the other </p><p>hand, the transfer of Premier\'s assets to Petronas will add </p><p>to the substantial stake that Malaysia (through Petronas) has </p><p>already established in Burma\'s energy sector.  It is now </p><p>Burma\'s major oil product supplier as well as one of the </p><p>largest investors in Burma\'s offshore gas fields.  As others </p><p>have chosen to shy away from Burma, Malaysia has bought in </p><p>and has now solidified a position that should give it </p><p>significant influence for years to come.  End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
