(C) DURING A ONE-AND-A-HALF-HOUR-MEETING MARCH 16 IN </p><p>HARARE, VISITING MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CONGO </p><p>EXPERT DAVID HAMADZIRIPI SHARED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S VIEWS </p><p>ON CERTAIN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CONGO.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO HAMADZIRIPI: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE ZIMBABWEANS ARE PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH THE </p><p>U.S. ADMINISTRATION\'S CURRENT STANCE ON THE CONGO.  HE </p><p>CITED AS THE REASON FOR HIS HAPPINESS A RECENT </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH AMBASSADOR CUNNINGHAM IN NEW YORK </p><p>DURING WHICH THE LATTER REPORTEDLY SAID THAT THE BUSH </p><p>ADMINISTRATION WAS PREPARED TO SUPPORT MONUC DEPLOYMENT; </p><p> </p><p>--  THE FRENCH INFORMED PRESIDENT MUGABE DURING THE </p><p>LATTER\'S RECENT TRIP TO PARIS THAT AMERICAN POSITION ON </p><p>THE CONGO HAD "MOVED CLOSER" TO THEIR OWN (NFI); </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01048  01 OF 02  161436Z </p><p> </p><p>--  ZIMBABWE IS MYSTIFIED BY BELGIUM\'S RECENT, </p><p>AGGRESSIVE INSERTION OF ITSELF INTO THE CONGO PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  HE SURMISED THAT BELGIUM FEELS A </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY AS FORMER COLONIAL METROPOLE FOR THE </p><p>CONGO\'S SECURITY, BUT UNDERSTOOD CLEARLY THAT BRUSSELS </p><p>HAS "OTHER INTERESTS" IN THE CONGO.  THE ZIMBABWEANS SAW </p><p>THE BELGIANS AS BEING AMBIVALENT ABOUT JOSEPH KABILA, </p><p>CLOSE TO THE UNARMED OPPOSITION IN THE CONGO AND HAVING </p><p>LITTLE USE FOR ANY OF THE REBEL MOVEMENTS; </p><p> </p><p>--  ZIMBABWE HAS NO QUARREL OR TENSIONS WITH THE </p><p>ANGOLANS OVER WHO HAS THE GREATEST INFLUENCE IN THE </p><p>CONGO, ALTHOUGH HE PROFESSED TO UNDERSTAND HOW SUCH AN </p><p>IMPRESSION MIGHT HAVE BEEN CREATED.  HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT DOS SANTOS PERSONALLY SACKED FORMER ANGOLAN </p><p>ARMED FORCES CHIEF JOAO DE MATOS, WHOSE MAIN SIN WAS </p><p>ENTERING INTO AN EXCESSIVELY CLOSE EMBRACE WITH THE </p><p>UGANDANS.  HAMADZIRIPI RECOUNTED HOW AT ONE SUMMIT IN </p><p>LUANDA THEN PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA ASKED DOS SANTOS TO </p><p>PRACTICE TRANSPARENCY WITH RESPECT TO HIS DEALINGS WITH </p><p>OUTSIDERS AND EXPLAIN MATOS\' INVITATION TO HIS UGANDAN </p><p>COUNTERPART TO VISIT LUANDA.  THE ANGOLAN PRESIDENT, WHO </p><p>HAD NOT BEEN BRIEFED ON THE INITIATIVE, REMAINED SILENT. </p><p>"JOAO DE MATOS BEHAVED AS IF HE WERE THE HEAD OF STATE </p><p>IN WAITING," THE ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMAT STATED, AND WHEN </p><p>THE ANGOLAN PRESIDENT WENT ON A VISIT TO THE FAR EAST IN </p><p>JANUARY HE MADE CERTAIN TO INCLUDE THE ALREADY FIRED </p><p>FORMER GENERAL IN HIS TRAVELING PARTY; </p><p> </p><p>--  RWANDA\'S CLAIM THAT IT IS IN THE CONGO BECAUSE IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01048  01 OF 02  161436Z </p><p>HAS SECURITY CONCERNS IS A SHAM.  THE ZIMBABWEANS ARE </p><p>SINCERELY READY TO WORK WITH THE RWANDANS ON IDENTIFYING </p><p>AND DEALING WITH GENOCIDAIRES.  WHEN PATRICK MAZIMHAKA </p><p>AND RWANDA\'S AMBASSADOR IN PRETORIA VISITED HARARE </p><p>RECENTLY TO DISCUSS THESE MATTERS THEY MISSED AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY BY NOT PUTTING THEIR CARDS ON THE TABLE; </p><p> </p><p>--  THERE IS NO REAL RESENTMENT THAT JOSEPH KABILA HAD </p><p>NOT MADE AN EARLY VISIT TO HARARE, ALTHOUGH IN SOME </p><p>QUARTERS THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS FOR HIM TO DO SO. </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI EXPLAINED THAT THE WAY THE LEADERSHIP HERE </p><p>SEES IT, KABILA SHOULD BE WORKING TO ESTABLISH THE </p><p>PERCEPTION THAT HE IS HIS OWN MAN, RATHER THAN BE SEEN </p><p>TO BE RUNNING TO THE ALLIES FOR EVERY LITTLE THING.  THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMAT DID SAY THAT KABILA  HAS COME UNDER </p><p>PRESSURE AT HOME TO CUT BACK ON HIS TRAVEL ABROAD AS </p><p>THERE ARE PROBLEMS APLENTY AT HOME.  HAMADZIRIPI ALSO </p><p>OBSERVED THAT IN KATANGA THE ZIMBABWEANS WERE </p><p>UNIVERSALLY WELCOMED WHEREAS IN KINSHASA THEY WERE LESS </p><p>GLADLY RECEIVED; </p><p> </p><p>--  ZIMBABWE AND THE ALLIES WILL BEGIN WITHDRAWING FROM </p><p>THEIR POSITIONS PER THE KAMPALA AGREEMENTS AND HARARE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO0226 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01048  02 OF 02  161436Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  USNW-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------D2D6E4  161436Z /38 </p><p>O 161433Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8453 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>AMEMBASSY KAMPALA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KIGALI </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINSHASA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUANDA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01048  02 OF 02  161436Z </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001048 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/16/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MCAP, MOPS, PINR, CG, ZI, AO, UG, RW </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE HAPPY WITH US POSITION ON THE </p><p>CONGO, MYSTIFIED BY THE BELGIANS </p><p> </p><p>SUB-PLANS WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  HE CLAIMED THAT ANY </p><p>SLOWNESS IN DEPLOYING WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>PROBLEMS.  ZIMBABWE AND THE CONGOLESE ARMY (FAC) ARE </p><p>PREPARED NOT TO REOCCUPY PWETO IF IT WOULD HELP MONUC. </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN ARMY COMMANDER CONSTANTINE CHIWENGA WAS </p><p>CURRENTLY IN KINSHASA NEGOTIATING THE WITHDRAWAL </p><p>MODALITIES WITH THE UN; </p><p> </p><p>--  BEGINNING POSSIBLY IN APRIL, ZIMBABWE WILL START </p><p>BRINGING HOME THE TROOPS IT SENT TO THE CONGO IN THE </p><p>IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF LAURENT KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION </p><p>AND MORE.  HE SAID THAT HIS COUNTRY\'S MILITARY ASSESSED </p><p>THAT IN SPITE OF CLAIMS OF MASSIVE TROOP WITHDRAWALS, </p><p>UGANDA HAD ONLY BROUGHT HOME 569 MEN.  "THEIRS IS A </p><p>GAME, A DANGEROUS GAME," THE ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMAT </p><p>AVERRED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  COMMMENT: HAMADZIRIPI CONSISTENLY HAS BEEN OUR </p><p>MOST FRANK AND BEST-INFORMED INTERLOCUTOR WHO IS EASILY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01048  02 OF 02  161436Z </p><p>ACCESSIBLE.  HE IS VERY CLOSE TO FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>STANISLAUS MUDENGE AND THUS IS ABLE TO SPEAK </p><p>AUTHORITATIVELY ON ZIMBAWEAN DIPLOMATIC POSITIONS.  HIS </p><p>POSTING TO KINSHASA IN OCTOBER 2000 HAS BEEN A REAL LOSS </p><p>TO US.  OF COURSE, LIKE MOST CIVIL SERVANTS HERE, HE </p><p>DISPENSES REAL INFORMATION PARSIMONIOULSY, ALWAYS PORTRAYS </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION IN THE MOST FAVORABLE LIGHT </p><p>AND SEEKS TO INFLUENCE AS MUCH AS TO INFORM.
