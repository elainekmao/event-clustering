BRUNO.  REASON: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) BEGIN SUMMARY:  MISSION OFFICERS RECENTLY CALLED ON </p><p>SEVERAL LEADING DISSIDENTS TO ASCERTAIN THEIR SITUATIONS AS </p><p>WELL AS THEIR VIEWS ON VIETNAM\'S FUTURE.  ALL REMAIN </p><p>SUBJECT TO ONGOING OFFICIAL MONITORING AND HARASSMENT, </p><p>ALBEIT UNEVENLY APPLIED.  INTERESTINGLY, SECURITY </p><p>AUTHORITIES, IN MOST CASES, APPEAR TO HONOR A PROVISION OF </p><p>LAW THAT REQUIRES POLICE TO TERMINATE AN INVESTIGATION IF </p><p>FORMAL CHARGES ARE NOT BROUGHT WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS.  AN </p><p>EXCEPTION IS THE CASE OF DR. NGUYEN DAN QUE, WHO REFUSED TO </p><p>LEAVE VIETNAM FOR THE U.S. AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN </p><p>1998.  ALL THE DISSIDENTS WE CONTACTED, AS WELL AS OTHERS </p><p>WE HAVE NOT YET CONTACTED, APPEAR TO REMAIN COMMITTED TO </p><p>CONTINUING THEIR OUTSPOKEN CRITICISM OF THE REGIME, MAINLY </p><p>THROUGH ESSAYS WHICH EVENTUALLY FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE </p><p>INTERNET.  ALL HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY FOREIGN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THERE IS AN ACTIVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02084  01 OF 06  190912Z </p><p>DISSIDENT NETWORK WHICH SECURITY PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN UNABLE </p><p>TO CURTAIL, LARGELY BECAUSE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY CELL PHONES, FAX AND ARE INCLUDED IN THIS YEAR\'S OFFICIAL </p><p>AMNESTIES.  HANOI\'S TREATMENT OF DISSIDENTS TODAY STANDS IN </p><p>SHARP CONTRAST WITH THAT OF A FEW YEARS AGO, WHEN A LONG </p><p>JAIL SENTENCE WAS A VIRTUAL CERTAINTY.  THE SRV\'S TREATMENT </p><p>COMPARES SOMEWHAT FAVORABLY WITH SOME OTHER COUNTRIES, </p><p>NOTABLY CHINA.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GAUGE WHAT KIND OF </p><p>FOLLOWINGS OUTSPOKEN DISSIDENTS MAY HAVE IN THIS </p><p>POLITICALLY THWARTED SOCIETY.  IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT MOST </p><p>DISSIDENTS ARE WELL INTO MIDDLE AGE OR OLDER, A SIGN THAT </p><p>COMPLACENCY OR FEAR, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, MAY CAUSE </p><p>VIETNAM\'S YOUTH TO HOLD THEIR TONGUES.  IT WILL BE </p><p>INTERESTING TO OBSERVE WHETHER, IN THE FACE OF THE SOCIAL </p><p>CHANGES THAT ACCOMPANY VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC GROWTH, </p><p>VIETNAMESE YOUTH WILL REMAIN SILENT OR WILL ALSO </p><p>AGITATE FOR POLITICAL CHANGE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NGUYEN THANH GIANG:  AN INTELLECTUAL WITH AN EDGE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLCOUNS AND POLOFF CALLED ON NGUYEN THANH GIANG </p><p>AUGUST 2 AT HIS HOME IN HANOI.  HIS AMCIT FATHER WAS ALSO </p><p>PRESENT.  GIANG, A 64-YEAR OLD RETIRED GEOPHYSICIST, WAS </p><p>ARRESTED IN MARCH 1999 AND DETAINED FOR TWO MONTHS FOR </p><p>WRITING ARTICLES CRITICAL OF THE REGIME AND CALLING FOR </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND A FREE MARKET ECONOMY FOR VIETNAM.  GIANG </p><p>SAID HE CONTINUES TO BE WATCHED INTERMITTENTLY BY POLICE </p><p>AND SUBJECT TO TRAVEL AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS.  HIS HOME </p><p>PHONE HAS BEEN CUT OFF FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, PREVENTING HIM </p><p>FROM BEING ABLE TO CORRESPOND BY EMAIL FROM HOME.  HE USES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02084  01 OF 06  190912Z </p><p>HIS HOME COMPUTER TO WRITE ARTICLES AND CORRESPONDENCE (A </p><p>PREVIOUS ONE WAS CONFISCATED BY POLICE LAST YEAR DURING </p><p>QUESTIONING).  HE SENDS AND RECEIVES EMAILS THROUGH A </p><p>HOTMAIL ACCOUNT VIA FRIENDS\' PC\'S.  (NOTE:  VIETNAMESE </p><p>DISSIDENTS AND OTHERS FAVOR HOTMAIL SINCE IT REPORTEDLY IS </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR THE AUTHORITIES TO MONITOR.  END NOTE.) </p><p>AFTER HIS PHONE LINE WAS CUT, GIANG BOUGHT A CELL PHONE </p><p>WITH WHICH HE KEEPS IN ACTIVE CONTACT WITH FRIENDS AND </p><p>FELLOW DISSIDENTS.  GIANG ADDED THAT HIS MAIL CONTINUES TO </p><p>BE INTERCEPTED.  THAT WHICH ARRIVES USUALLY SHOWS BLATANT </p><p>SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN OPENED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) GIANG NOTED SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON HIM HAVE </p><p>LESSENED IN THE PAST MONTHS.  HE HAS NOT BEEN CALLED IN FOR </p><p>FORMAL QUESTIONING SINCE MARCH (A FULL YEAR AFTER POLICE </p><p>ARRESTED HIM AND LAUNCHED A FORMAL INVESTIGATION).  GIANG </p><p>GLEEFULLY DESCRIBED TO POLOFFS HOW HE QUARRELED WITH HIS </p><p>INTERROGATORS, AND SOMETIMES REFUSED TO RESPOND TO </p><p>SUMMONSES.  HE SAID THE POLICE HAVE TOLD HIM THEY HAVE </p><p>HALTED THEIR INVESTIGATION.  IRONICALLY, GIANG SAID, </p><p>ACCORDING TO VIETNAMESE LAW, AFTER ONE YEAR, THE POLICE </p><p>MUST CEASE AN INVESTIGATION ON A SUSPECT IF THEY TURN UP </p><p>INADEQUATE EVIDENCE WITH WHICH TO PRESS FORMAL CHARGES. </p><p>(COMMENT:  HE STATED THIS MATTER-OF-FACTLY, CLEARLY </p><p>ACCEPTING AS BINDING LEGAL LIMITATIONS ON POLICE </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE PRACTICES.  AS NOTED IN REF B ON THE CRIMINAL </p><p>CODE, THIS IS AN ENCOURAGING SIGN OF A SLOW DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>RULE OF LAW FOLLOWING ON THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S RECENT </p><p>PASSING OF NEW REVISIONS TO THIS CODE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) GIANG SAID HE HAS FACED NO REPRISALS SINCE SIGNING </p><p>A LETTER IN MAY CRITICIZING THE GVN\'S ARREST AND SUBSEQUENT </p><p>HOUSE DETENTION OF DISSIDENT SCIENTIST HA SY PHU IN DALAT </p><p>(REF A).  HE ADDED THAT THE OTHER FIVE CO-SIGNERS, THUS </p><p>FAR, HAVE ALSO NOT EXPERIENCED REPRISALS.  AMONG THEM, HE </p><p>MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY HOANG MINH CHINH, A HERO OF DIEN </p><p>BIEN PHU AND FORMER CPV OFFICIAL, WHOM HE VISITS </p><p>OCCASIONALLY IN HANOI. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) GIANG SAID SECURITY FORCES DO NOT "ACT CLEARLY" </p><p>AGAINST HIM.  RATHER, THEY SEEK TO ISOLATE AND ALIENATE HIM </p><p>AND OTHER DISSIDENTS THROUGH INTIMIDATION AND IMPOSITION OF </p><p>A CLOUD OF ONGOING INVESTIGATION OVER THEM.  IN HIS CASE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02084  02 OF 06  190913Z </p><p>HIS FAMILY CAME UNDER PRESSURE.  SHORTLY AFTER GIANG\'S </p><p>ARREST, HIS SON WAS FIRED FROM HIS JOB WITH THE STATE </p><p>PETROLEUM INSTITUTE AND HIS DAUGHTER DISMISSED FROM HER </p><p>POSITION IN THE MINISTRY OF LABOR AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS.  HIS </p><p>SON HAS SINCE FOUND WORK WITH A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY RUN BY A </p><p>VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN, AND HIS DAUGHTER WITH A FOREIGN NGO. </p><p>GIANG ADDED TO HIS LITANY OF COMPLAINTS FREQUENT POLICE </p><p>PATROLS NEAR HIS HOUSE, WHICH DISCOURAGE FRIENDS AND </p><p>ACQUAINTANCES FROM VISITING. (NOTE:  THE WARD\'S POLICE </p><p>STATION IS TWO BLOCKS FROM GIANG\'S HOUSE.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) GIANG CONTINUES WRITING CRITICAL ESSAYS.  HE </p><p>PRESENTED US VIETNAMESE TEXTS OF SEVERAL ARTICLES HE HAS </p><p>WRITTEN THIS YEAR, INCLUDING ON GLOBALIZATION AND </p><p>DEMOCRATICIZATION, AND REFORM OF THE STATE ECONOMIC SECTOR. </p><p>HE SAID HE IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF VIETNAM\'S SHIFTING TO A </p><p>KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY.  HE SAID HE WANTS TO CONVINCE THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY TO LET THIS PROCESS PROCEED.  AS IN THE </p><p>PAST, HE ADDRESSES HIS LETTERS TO SENIOR LEADERS, FROM </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU ON DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>THE DISSIDENT NETWORK </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) GIANG DESCRIBED AN ACTIVE DISSIDENT NETWORK, WHOSE </p><p>MEMBERS FIND VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH TO KEEP IN TOUCH IN THE </p><p>FACE OF GOVERNMENT HARASSMENT.  INTERMEDIARIES, CELL PHONES </p><p>AND THE INTERNET ARE THE CHIEF MEANS OF MAINTAINING </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS.  THEY ARE ABLE TO VISIT EACH OTHER </p><p>RELATIVELY EASILY, FAVORED CAFES BEING THE USUAL VENUE FOR </p><p>MEETINGS.  POLICE NONETHELESS SEEK TO BLOCK THESE LINES OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02084  02 OF 06  190913Z </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS BY CUTTING PHONE LINES, INTERCEPTING MAIL </p><p>AND CONDUCTING OPEN SURVEILLANCE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) GIANG VISITS LEADING DISSIDENT, GEN. TRAN DO, A 76- </p><p>YEAR OLD WAR HERO AND FORMER SENIOR CPV OFFICIAL WHO WAS </p><p>EXPELLED FROM THE PARTY IN 1999, AT THE LATTER\'S HOME </p><p>RELATIVELY FREQUENTLY.  TRAN DO COMPLETED HIS LATEST ESSAY </p><p>IN LATE JULY, REVIEWING A "FAMOUS VIETNAMESE NOVEL" ABOUT </p><p>THE LIFE OF A PRISONER.  GIANG SAID TRAN DO RECEIVES "MANY </p><p>VISITORS," MOSTLY "ORDINARY VIETNAMESE," AT HIS HOME IN </p><p>DOWNTOWN HANOI.  (NOTE:  TRAN DO, THUS FAR, HAS BEEN KEPT </p><p>STRICTLY OFF-LIMITS TO FOREIGNERS.  AT SOME POINT, WE MAY </p><p>BE ABLE TO VISIT HIM AS WELL.  END NOTE.)   GIANG SAID GEN. </p><p>DO ALSO IS NO LONGER THE SUBJECT OF REGULAR POLICE </p><p>INTERROGATIONS, AGAIN DUE TO THE TWELVE-MONTH LIMITATION ON </p><p>POLICE INVESTIGATIONS.  HE SAID HE OCCASIONALLY CONTACTS </p><p>FELLOW DISSIDENT, NOVELIST DUONG THU HUONG (SEE PARA. 19). </p><p>WHEN HE CALLS HER ON HIS CELL PHONE, HOWEVER, A RUSH OF </p><p>STATIC INTERFERES, WHICH HE BLAMES ON GVN SECURITY </p><p>MONITORS.  GIANG SAID HE HAS SOME "COURAGEOUS" FRIENDS WHO </p><p>VISIT HIM AT HOME, THOUGH OTHERS WILL NOT.  GENERALLY, </p><p>THOSE WHO VISIT ARE OLDER RETIREES, INCLUDING VETERANS AND </p><p>OTHER FORMER PRISONERS.  FRIENDS WHO CURRENTLY WORK FOR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OR RELATED INSTITUTIONS DO NOT VISIT FOR FEAR OF </p><p>OFFICIAL REPRISALS, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>GIANG ON HUMAN RIGHTS TODAY AND TOMORROW </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) WHEN ASKED HIS VIEWS ON HUMAN RIGHTS CONDITIONS IN </p><p>VIETNAM TODAY, GIANG BRISTLED.  THE AUTHORITIES CAN AND DO </p><p>TRAMPLE ON CITIZENS\' RIGHTS WITH IMPUNITY, HE SAID.  HE </p><p>CITED HIS OWN CASE.  "WHERE DO THEY GET OFF CUTTING MY </p><p>PHONELINE?  I\'M A FREE MAN," HE SAID.  GIANG NOTED THIS WAS </p><p>PART OF THE ONGOING OFFICIAL EFFORTS TO ISOLATE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATE THOSE WHO CRITICIZE THE COMMUNIST PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) WE ASKED GIANG FOR HIS VIEWS OF VIETNAM\'S FUTURE. </p><p>HE REPLIED HE IS OPTIMISTIC IN THE LONG TERM.  COMPARING </p><p>VIETNAM\'S DEVELOPMENT TO THAT OF CHINA\'S, HE SAID THAT AS </p><p>IN THAT COUNTRY, MOMENTUM WILL BUILD BEHIND A DEMOCRATIC </p><p>MOVEMENT.  WHAT HAPPENS IN THE PRC WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON </p><p>VIETNAM.  HE CITED SPECIFICALLY CALLS AMONG MANY CHINESE </p><p>FOR A MULTIPARTY SYSTEM.  VIETNAMESE WATCH SUCH </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY, GIANG SAID.  HE APPLAUDED THE SIGNING </p><p>OF THE U.S.-VIETNAM TRADE AGREEMENT AS AN EXTREMELY POSTIVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02084  03 OF 06  190913Z </p><p>STEP WHICH WILL BRING IN ITS WAKE CATALYSTS FOR POSITIVE </p><p>CHANGE, POLITICALLY AS WELL AS ECONOMICALLY.  HE SAID HE </p><p>FORESEES ACCELERATED STRUGGLE WITHIN THE CPV LEADERSHIP, </p><p>ALREADY RACKED WITH STASIS AND DIVISION. </p><p> </p><p>THICH QUANG DO: DISSIDENT BUDDHIST FACES ONGOING HARASSMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) IN A PHONE CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF ON JULY 28, </p><p>THICH QUANG DO, A 71-YEAR OLD LEADER OF THE BANNED UNIFIED </p><p>BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM (UBCV) AND THRICE-NOMINATED </p><p>NOBEL PRIZE CANDIDATE, REPORTED THAT HE CONTINUES TO FACE </p><p>HARASSMENT BY THE POLICE.  DO TOLD ASIAWEEK IN JUNE THAT </p><p>"THEY (THE AUTHORITIES) WANT TO ISOLATE ME AS IF I WERE A </p><p>CONTAGIOUS DISEASE."  HE RARELY VENTURES OUTSIDE HIS PAGODA </p><p>IN HCMC; WHEN HE DOES, IT IS MAINLY FOR PERIODIC MEDICAL </p><p>CHECK-UPS.  HE TOLD US HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM THE </p><p>HOSPITAL FOR A ROUTINE CHECK-UP FOR HIS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE </p><p>AND DIABETES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) AMONG MEMBERS OF VIETNAM\'S SMALL OUTSPOKEN </p><p>DISSIDENT COMMUNITY, THICH QUANG DO IS PERHAPS THE MOST </p><p>UNABASHEDLY CANDID OVER THE PHONE.  HE TOLD US HE CONTINUES </p><p>TO RECEIVE FREQUENT VISITORS AT HIS PAGODA, AND MAINTAINS </p><p>ACTIVE CORRESPONDENCE WITH FELLOW MONKS OF THE UBCV.  DO </p><p>CONTINUES TO PRESS FOR LEGAL RECOGNITION OF HIS CHURCH AND </p><p>SEEKS PERMISSION FOR FELLOW SENIOR MONK, THICH HUYEN QUANG, </p><p>CURRENTLY RESTRICTED TO AN ISOLATED LOCALE IN QUANG NGAI </p><p>PROVINCE, TO MOVE TO HCMC.  HE CONTINUES TO WRITE LETTERS </p><p>TO THE SRV LEADERSHIP CALLING FOR FREEDOM OF RELIGION. </p><p>THESE ARE CIRCULATED GLOBALLY THROUGH THE UBCV\'S OFFICE IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02084  03 OF 06  190913Z </p><p>PARIS.  SOME FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO VIETNAM VIA PRESS </p><p>REPORTS, FOREIGN RADIO BROADCASTS AND THE INTERNET. </p><p> </p><p>HEAVY HARASSMENT OF DR. QUE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) EMBASSY POLOFF CALLED ON DR. NGUYEN DAN QUE AT HIS </p><p>HOME IN HCMC ON JULY 17.  CG HCMC POLOFF MADE A FOLLOW-UP </p><p>VISIT AUG. 28.  QUE WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON IN 1998 AFTER </p><p>SERVING EIGHT YEARS.  HE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF JAIL SINCE </p><p>1978 FOR TAKING OPENLY CRITICAL POSITIONS OF THE COMMUNIST </p><p>SYSTEM.  HE REFUSED TO DEPART VIETNAM FOR THE U.S., ON </p><p>WHICH THE GVN HAD INSISTED AS A CONDITION OF HIS LAST </p><p>RELEASE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) THE 58-YEAR OLD PHYSICIAN SAID HIS HEALTH HAS </p><p>IMPROVED SINCE HE WAS TREATED EARLY IN THE YEAR FOR </p><p>BLEEDING ULCERS.  HE HAD A CHECK-UP AT A FOREIGN-RUN CLINIC </p><p>IN HCMC JUST AFTER TET; AN AUSTRALIAN DOCTOR THERE </p><p>PRESCRIBED A TWO-WEEK TREATMENT.  HIS AMCIT BROTHER, ALSO A </p><p>PHYSICIAN, SENDS HIM MEDICINES FROM THE U.S.  HE HAS NOT </p><p>EXPERIENCED BLEEDING FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS, THOUGH HE </p><p>SAYS IT IS A RECURRENT PROBLEM AND SOME PAIN LINGERS. </p><p>(COMMENT: THE PRESSURES OF OFFICIAL HARASSMENT AND </p><p>ISOLATION, AFTER A LONG PRISON TERM, HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL </p><p>ON QUE.  HE SEEMED VISIBLY MORE STRESSED AND NERVOUS </p><p>(INCLUDING A FACIAL TIC) COMPARED WITH THE LAST TIME WE SAW </p><p>HIM MONTHS AGO.  END COMMENT.)  HE TOLD POLOFF HE FACES A </p><p>LOT OF "MENTAL PRESSURE" FROM POLICE.  A COUPLE OF </p><p>UNIFORMED POLICE PASS BY HIS HOUSE SEVERAL TIMES EACH DAY. </p><p>HE SAID THEY ENTER HIS HOUSE TO QUESTION HIM AND INSPECT </p><p>HIS COMPUTER AND PAPERS AT LEAST TWICE A MONTH.  SOMETIMES </p><p>THEY BANG ON THE DOOR.  EMBOFF VISITED IN THE EVENING.  QUE </p><p>SAID THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO DO SO, SINCE THE POLICE ARE </p><p>OFF DUTY THEN.  HE SAID FRIENDS VISIT HIM IN THE EVENINGS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) QUE SAID HIS MEDICAL COLLEAGUES ARE AFRAID TO </p><p>TREAT HIM; POLICE INTIMIDATE HIS FRIENDS THROUGH </p><p>QUESTIONING, WHICH DISCOURAGES MANY OF THEM FROM CONTACTING </p><p>HIM.  HIS WIFE IS QUESTIONED BY POLICE, AND SOMETIMES </p><p>INTIMIDATED BY PHONE.  THE OFFICIAL HARASSMENT HAS MADE HER </p><p>LIFE EQUALLY AS DIFFICULT, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) QUE\'S HOME PHONE AND INTERNET ACCESS WERE CUT OFF </p><p>IN MAY AFTER HE FAXED A 100-PAGE DOCUMENT TO THE U.S. AND </p><p>FRANCE.  LIKE GIANG, HE DOES HIS WRITINGS ON HIS HOME PC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02084  04 OF 06  190913Z </p><p>AND COMMUNICATES BY CELL PHONE (HIS AMCIT BROTHER CALLED </p><p>DURING POLOFF\'S VISIT.)  HE SAID HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN </p><p>AN INTERNET ACCOUNT ON THREE OCCASIONS BRIEFLY THROUGH THE </p><p>ASSISTANCE OF FRIENDS.  SECURITY CADRE CUT THESE SERVICES, </p><p>HOWEVER, SHORTLY AFTER START-UP.  SIMILARLY, SECURITY </p><p>OFFICIALS TERMINATED THE FIRST CELL PHONE ACCOUNT, </p><p>WHEREUPON HE SIMPLY BOUGHT ANOTHER.  IRONICALLY, HE </p><p>SOMETIMES RECEIVES "WARNING CALLS" BY PHONE FROM POLICE, </p><p>DEMANDING TO KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING, OR TELLING HIM TO "BE </p><p>CAREFUL," AFTER WHICH THEY ABRUPTLY HANG UP. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) QUE SAID HE WANTS TO CONTINUE HIS READING AND </p><p>WRITING, BUT HIS ACTIVITIES ARE LIMITED BY THE RESTRICTIONS </p><p>PLACED ON HIM.  HE TURNED OVER TO POLOFF ESSAYS CONTAINING </p><p>HIS VIEWS ON THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT AS </p><p>WELL AS DETAILED INFORMATION ON POLITICAL PRISONERS (TO BE </p><p>REPORTED SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) QUE MEETS SINGLY WITH SEVERAL YOUNG STUDENTS TO </p><p>DISCUSS PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND OTHER ISSUES.  HE SAID, </p><p>THROUGH THIS MEANS, HE WANTS TO TRAIN YOUNGER PEOPLE TO </p><p>CARRY FORTH THE IDEAS THAT WILL ONE DAY BRING CHANGE TO </p><p>VIETNAM.  UNDER THEIR URGING, HE HAS BEGUN AN UNDERGROUND </p><p>NEWSPAPER CALLED "TUONG LAI" ("THE FUTURE").  THE FIRST </p><p>EDITION, ELEVEN PAGES LONG, ADDRESSES HUMAN RIGHTS, CPV </p><p>POLICIES, YOUTH AND DEMOCRACY.  AS OF OUR MEETING, HE HAD </p><p>NOT YET DISTRIBUTED THE NEWSPAPER, NOR DID HE ELABORATE HOW </p><p>HE MIGHT DO SO.  QUE ADDED HE WOULD LIKE TO FORM A CHAPTER </p><p>OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL.  HE LAMENTED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>WITHOUT REGULAR INTERNET ACCESS, HE IS GREATLY HAMPERED IN </p><p>HIS EFFORTS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02084  04 OF 06  190913Z </p><p> </p><p>THE UNSINKABLE DUONG THU HUONG:  SOCIALIST ANTI-HERO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) DUONG THU HUONG, LIKE GEN. TRAN DO, WAS A TRUSTED, </p><p>DECORATED CADRE WHO SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME DISILLUSIONED AND </p><p>CRITICAL OF THE REGIME.  THE 53-YEAR OLD NOVELIST SERVED </p><p>WITH DISTINCTION IN THE "AMERICAN" WAR AS A SUPPORT CADRE </p><p>FROM 1968 UNTIL THE CONFLICT\'S END.  SHE WAS ALSO A CPV </p><p>MEMER.  IN THE YEARS AFTER THE WAR, HUONG BECAME REPELED </p><p>BY WHAT SHE SAW AS CYNICISM, CORRUPTION AND YPOCRISY IN </p><p>THE REGIME AND BEGAN TO WRITE ABOUT T.  HER NOVELS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY "PARADISE OF THE BLIND" AND "BEYOND </p><p>ILLUSIONS," BECAME BEST-SELLERS INSIDE VIETNAM BEFORE BEING </p><p>BANNED, AND ATTRACTED A SIZABLE FOLLOWING OUTSIDE THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  (NOTE:  DESPITE THE OFFICIAL BAN ON HER WORKS, </p><p>PHOTOCOPIES CIRCULATE WIDELY INSIDE VIETNAM TODAY.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  HER OUTSPOKEN CRITICISM, HOWEVER, INCURRED REPEATED </p><p>WARNINGS FROM THE PARTY.  SHE WAS EXPELLED IN THE LATE </p><p>1980\'S (SHE CAST THE TIEBREAKER VOTE IN HER PARTY CELL FOR </p><p>HER OWN EXPULSION).  IN 1991, SHE WAS ARRESTED AND SERVED </p><p>UNDER A YEAR IN PRISON WITH NO FORMAL CHARGES LODGED.  AN </p><p>INCREASINGLY VOCAL CRITIC WITH A GROWING FOREIGN AUDIENCE, </p><p>HUONG WAS PRESSURED TO EXILE HERSELF TO FRANCE, BUT </p><p>REFUSED, SAYING, "I WANT TO STAY HERE TO INSULT THOSE IN </p><p>POWER."  SHE IS A RECIPIENT OF FRANCE\'S HIGHEST LITERARY </p><p>AWARD AND IS REGULARLY DEFENDED BY AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL PEN. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) CPV HEROES-TURNED CRITICS, SUCH AS HUONG AND GEN. </p><p>DO, ARE SEEN BY THE PARTY AS APOSTATES AND, AS A RESULT, </p><p>INCUR ESPECIALLY STRONG REPRISALS.  IN 1998, POLICE ENTERED </p><p>HUONG\'S HOME AND ABRUPTLY TERMINATED AN INTERVIEW SHE WAS </p><p>CONDUCTING WITH A READER\'S DIGEST REPORTER, WHO WAS THEN </p><p>DEPORTED.  READER\'S DIGEST PUBLISHED THE INTERVIEW THAT </p><p>YEAR.  SECURITY AUTHORITIES THEN PUT HUONG UNDER INTENSE </p><p>SURVEILLANCE.  EMBOFFS HAD TO ABORT EFFORTS TO SEEK A </p><p>MEETING WITH HER THAT YEAR VIA INTERMEDIARIES AFTER THE </p><p>LATTER WERE THREATENED BY POLICE.  SECURITY PERSONNEL </p><p>EFFECTIVELY PUT HUONG UNDER HOUSE ARREST.  THIS ENDED ABOUT </p><p>A YEAR AGO. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (C) HUONG GAVE A LENGTHY TELEPHONE INTERVIEW IN JULY </p><p>TO RADIO FREE ASIA.  SHE PREDICTED IN THAT INTERVIEW THAT </p><p>THE SRV\'S COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP "WILL BE SWEPT AWAY BY THE </p><p>RIVER OF TIME."  SHE SAID SHE HAS |HUONG SAID, "MY CONTACT WITH THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02084  05 OF 06  190914Z </p><p>OUTSIDE WORLD IS VERY INTERMITTENT.  SOME MAIL ARRIVES AND </p><p>OTHER MAIL DOESN\'T . . . I RECEIVED AN INVITATION (AFTER </p><p>THE EVENT) FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY TO THEIR NATIONAL DAY </p><p>EVENT.  ENVELOPES ARE CUT OPEN AND RESEALED SLOPPILY."  SHE </p><p>SAID HER PHONE HAD BEEN RECONNECTED AFTER AN INTERVENTION </p><p>BY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT.  HUONG SAID SHE REMAINS UNDAUNTED </p><p>IN THE FACE OF SUCH MEASURES -- "I NO LONGER CARE FOR I </p><p>HAVE KNOWN THEM SO WELL." </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) POLCOUNS MET TWICE WITH DUONG THU HUONG RECENTLY. </p><p>SHE REITERATED HER FIRM COMMITMENT TO FIGHT FOR A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM THROUGH HER WRITINGS.  SHE SAID THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES ARE NO LONGER SURVEILLING HER CONSTANTLY, BUT </p><p>SHE REPEATED THE PETTY HARASSMENT AND MONITORING MEASURES </p><p>REPORTED IN THE RFA INTERVIEW.  WHEN POLCOUNS ASKED IF SHE </p><p>WERE CONCERNED ABOUT MEASURES THE AUTHORITIES MIGHT TAKE IN </p><p>THE FUTURE, HUONG REPLIED SIMPLY, "I DON\'T CARE.  THEY\'LL </p><p>NEVER SHUT ME UP.  I\'VE TOLD THEM I\'LL SPEAK OUT UNTIL THIS </p><p>EVIL SYSTEM IS GONE OR I AM DEAD."  TO UNDERSCORE HER </p><p>DEFIANCE, SHE INVITED POLCOUNS TO VISIT HER AT HER HOME, </p><p>SURE TO DRAW THE ATTENTION OF T HER. (NOTE:  A FEW, ELDERLY, VIETNAMESE </p><p>WRITERS AT A RECENT EMBASSY-SPONSORED SYMPOSIUM OPENLY </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH HUONG, WHILE MOST OF THE REST STEERED CLEAR </p><p>OF HER.  HUONG IS AN EFFERVESCENT WOMAN WITH AN INFECTIOUS </p><p>SENSE OF HUMOR, PROBING MIND AND A DEEP WELL OF ENERGY.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  PROSPECTS FOR CHANGE.  WHAT ABOUT THE YOUTH? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C) OUR CONTACTS WITH DISSIDENTS REVEAL A GVN POLICY </p><p>OF SEEKING TO ALIENATE AND ISOLATE VOCAL CRITICS, FIRST BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02084  05 OF 06  190914Z </p><p>HEAVY MEASURES, FOLLOWED BY INTERMITTENT HARASSMENT -- </p><p>EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DR. QUE.  THE LATTER\'S UNCEASING </p><p>INTIMIDATION MAY BE DUE, PARTLY, TO HIS REFUSAL TO LEAVE </p><p>THE COUNTRY UPON RELEASE FROM PRISON; THE AUTHORITIES MAY </p><p>BE KEEPING THE PRESSURE ON IN AN EFFORT TO GET HIM TO </p><p>CHANGE HIS MIND.  THE CASES OF GEOPHYSICIST GIANG AND CPV </p><p>APOSTATES TRAN DO AND DUONG THU HUONG ARE IRONIC IN THAT </p><p>THE AUTHORITIES APPEAR TO BE MORE OR LESS HONORING A </p><p>PROVISION OF LAW THAT REQUIRES TERMINATION OF INVESTIGATION </p><p>AND ACCOMPANYING MONITORING/HOUSE ARREST IF CHARGES ARE NOT </p><p>BROUGHT WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF INITIAL DETENTION.  REF B </p><p>PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION </p><p>DECREE, WHICH IS MOST OFTEN USED AGAINST POLITICAL AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS DISSIDENTS.  IT IS TOO EARLY TO CONCLUDE THAT </p><p>THERE MAY BE A CRACK OF LIGHT IN THE DARK CLOUDS THAT BEAR </p><p>ON OPEN CRITICS OF THE SRV.  THE CASE OF HA SY PHU (REF A) </p><p>CERTAINLY BODES ILL.  FUTURE TREATMENT OF DISSIDENTS AND </p><p>THE OUTCOME OF THIS YEAR\'S PRISONER AMNESTIES MAY GIVE US </p><p>CLUES.  IT MUST BE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT HANOI\'S TREATMENT </p><p>OF DISSIDENTS TODAY STANDS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THAT OF A </p><p>FEW YEARS AGO, WHEN A LONG JAIL SENTENCE WAS A VIRTUAL </p><p>CERTAINTY.  THE SRV\'S TREATMENT ALSO COMPARES FAVORABLY </p><p>WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>24.  (C) FINALLY, IN THIS POLITICALLY THWARTED SOCIETY IT </p><p>IS EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO GAUGE THE SUPPORT OR EVEN </p><p>AWARENESS THESE DISSIDENTS HAVE AMONG THE GENERAL </p><p>POPULATION, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE INTELLIGENTSIA AND </p><p>EDUCATED YOUTH.  ON OCCASION, WRITERS DO EXPRESS PRIVATELY </p><p>DEEP FRUSTRATIONS WITH GVN RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR WORK AND </p><p>AN IMPATIENCE FOR CHANGE.  IT IS NOTEWORTHY, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>THERE ARE FEW, IF ANY, DISSIDENTS WHO ARE IN THEIR 30\'S OR </p><p>YOUNGER.  (THE AVERAGE AGE OF THOSE ADDRESSED IN THIS </p><p>REPORT IS 64.)  THIS CAN BE EXPLAINED, IN LARGE PART, TO A </p><p>FEAR OF LOSING ONE\'S LIVELIHOOD.  RETIREES HAVE LESS AT </p><p>STAKE. THE AGING VOCAL DISSIDENTS WITH WHOM WE ARE IN TOUCH </p><p>UNIVERSALLY ATTRIBUTE YOUNGER PEOPLE\'S SILENCE ON POLITICAL </p><p>MATTERS TO THESE FACTORS.  TODAY\'S VIETNAM ALSO OFFERS </p><p>GREATER ECONOMIC AND PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TOWARD </p><p>WHICH TO DEVOTE ONE\'S TALENTS.
