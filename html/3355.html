THE VATICAN HAS NO CONTACT WITH ITS MEMBERS, </p><p>HE SAID, BUT IT DOES EXIST.  MIGLIORE SAID THAT THE NUMBER </p><p>OF CATHOLICS AND CHRISTIANS CAN ONLY BE ESTIMATED, BUT THE </p><p>CHURCH SURVIVES, ALBEIT WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP OF PRIESTS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4240 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03637  02 OF 02  231503Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CA-01    CIAE-00 </p><p>      C-00     DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   FBIE-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03   OES-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PER-00   PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /014W </p><p>                  ------------------CF17DB  231507Z /38 </p><p>R 231501Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY SEOUL </p><p>AMCONSUL HONG KONG </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 003637 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

PLEASE PASS USAID ANE AND BHR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EAID, KN, KS, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: AID AND ADVOCACY FOR NORTH KOREA - VATICAN AGENCY </p><p>SEEKS MORE DONORS, INCREASED CONTACTS </p><p> </p><p>AND BISHOPS.  WHILE THE NORTH KOREAN CONSTITUTION ALLOWS FOR </p><p>FREEDOM OF RELIGION, MIGLIORE STATED THAT THERE IS NO REAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03637  02 OF 02  231503Z </p><p>FREEDOM OF WORSHIP.  THERE IS AN OFFICIAL "CATHOLIC </p><p>ASSOCIATION", BUT MIGLIORE SAID THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED </p><p>WITH THE "TRUE CHURCH" (I.E., LOYAL TO ROME) AND NEITHER THE </p><p>VATICAN NOR CARITAS CONSIDER ITS ADHERENTS AS INTERLOCUTORS. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU) THE HOLY SEE RESPONDED TO THE FIRST HUMANITARIAN </p><p>APPEAL FOR AID TO NORTH KOREAN IN 1996 WITH A DIRECT </p><p>DONATION TO THE CARITAS FUND.  IN 1997, CARITAS PROVIDED </p><p>FOOD AND CLOTHING AS A WAY FOR THE HOLY SEE TO "KEEP A FOOT </p><p>IN THE DOOR."  MIGLIORE SAID THAT, LIKE CARITAS, THE VATICAN </p><p>NEEDS MORE CONTACT WITH THE NORTH KOREANS IN ORDER TO </p><p>IMPROVE RELATIONS.  THE NEW NORTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR TO ITALY </p><p>AND TO THE UN\'S FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION IN ROME </p><p>HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH MAKING CONTACT WITH THE HOLY SEE. </p><p>MIGLIORE NOTED THAT BOTH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND SOUTH KOREA </p><p>NEEDED TO WORK OUT WAYS TO ENGAGE NORTH KOREA AND EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT PROPER SUPPORT MUST BE GIVEN TO SOUTH KOREA FOR THIS </p><p>WORK.  THE VATICAN\'S MISSIONARY AGENCY HEAD, CARDINAL </p><p>CRESCENZIO SEPE, SAID DURING A JULY 4 VISIT TO SOUTH KOREA </p><p>THAT THE HOLY SEE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE NORTH KOREA AT THE </p><p>"NON DIPLOMATIC" LEVEL.  SEPE SPOKE OF MISSIONARY EFFORTS </p><p>FOR NORTH KOREA TO ENHANCE ITS MORAL, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL </p><p>GROWTH AND TASKED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE SOUTH WITH THIS </p><p>WORK. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>SOUTH KOREA AS GO BETWEEN? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.   (SBU) CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS OFFICIALS ALSO REVIEWED </p><p>THE ROLE OF ITS SOUTH KOREA MEMBER ORGANIZATION IN PROVIDING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03637  02 OF 02  231503Z </p><p>AID TO THE NORTH.  AT PRESENT CARITAS SOUTH KOREA SENDS AID </p><p>TO NORTH KOREA VIA THE CARITAS CONFEDERATION HEADQUARTERS IN </p><p>VATICAN CITY.  OTHERWISE THE MAIN CHANNEL FOR AID FROM THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH IN SOUTH KOREA IS THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR </p><p>RECONCILIATION OF THE KOREAN PEOPLE.  IN THE PAST, CI HAS </p><p>ASKED CARITAS SOUTH KOREA TO TAKE ON THE AID LIAISON ROLE </p><p>FOR NORTH KOREA - A POSITION CURRENTLY HELD BY CARITAS HONG </p><p>KONG.  CARITAS SOUTH KOREA CITES POLITICAL REASONS FOR NOT </p><p>BEING IN A POSITION TO ACCEPT THE CHARGE.  IT WANTS THE </p><p>CURRENT STRUCTURE MAINTAINED, WITH CARITAS HONG KONG GIVEN A </p><p>THREE TO FIVE YEAR MANDATE -- IN EXPECTATION OF A GRADUALLY </p><p>SUNNIER POLITICAL SITUATION BETWEEN SOUTH AND NORTH KOREA. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.   (SBU) POST EXPECTS CARITAS AND THE HOLY SEE TO CONTINUE </p><p>TO SEEK AS CLOSE CONTACT WITH NORTH KOREA AS FEASIBLE. </p><p>HOWEVER, WHILE CARITAS WILL PURSUE THE MOST EFFECTIVE </p><p>RESPONSE TO AN ON-GOING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, THE HOLY SEE </p><p>WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY WORK TO SHORE UP ITS INTERESTS IN THE </p><p>COMMUNIST STATE, IN PARTICULAR ITS DESIRE TO RE-ESTABLISH </p><p>THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WITH A FORMAL LEADERSHIP OF PRIESTS AND </p><p>BISHOPS.  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN SOUTH KOREA WILL BE THE </p><p>LIKELY SOURCE OF NEW PERSONNEL.  REGULAR MEETINGS IN VATICAN </p><p>CITY OF CARITAS\' NORTH KOREA COUNTRY GROUP WILL PROVIDE </p><p>EMBASSY WITH A CONTINUING SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN, POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS SITUATION IN THE DPRK. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03637  02 OF 02  231503Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA03637 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
