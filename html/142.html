<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ALEXANDRIA 01240 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, IS, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISRAELI ACTIVITIES IN ALEXANDRIA AND THE DELTA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ALEXANDRIA 805 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL-ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ISRAELI CONSUL GENERAL WAS PLEASED WITH </p><p>RESULTS OF HIS AMBASSADOR\'S RECENT (AND, SURPRISINGLY, </p><p>HIS FIRST) "OFFICIAL" VISIT TO ALEXANDRIA.  IN WAKE </p><p>OF SEPTEMBER SUMMIT, INCREASED INTEREST IN TOURISM WAS </p><p>EXPRESSED, BUT LOCAL ISRAELIS DO NOT EXPECT ANY </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGE.  ZIM LINES IS DOING ADEQUATE </p><p>BUSINESS WITH ALEXANDRIA\'S PORT, DESPITE TRADE </p><p>SLOWDOWN GENERALLY.  SMALL ISRAELI AGRICULTURAL </p><p>ACTIVITY CONTINUES IN DELTA, RECENTLY EXPANDED BY </p><p>NEW, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT JOINT VENTURE NEAR </p><p>GIANCLIS.  ISRAELI CONGEN IS MUM ABOUT RUMORS HE </p><p>WILL BE REPLACED EARLY NEXT YEAR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SASSON\'S "OFFICIAL" VISIT TO ALEXANDRIA: </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>3.  AT AN OCTOBER 28 MEETING, ISRAELI CONGEN TUVAL </p><p>AND I SHARED PERPSECTIVES ON RECENT VISITS BY OUR </p><p>RESPECTIVE AMBASSADORS TO ALEXANDRIA.  AFTER </p><p>DESCRIBING THE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES ENGAGED IN BY </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND MRS. WISNER AND THE ENTHUSIASTIC </p><p>RECEPTION THEY RECEIVED, I ASKED TUVAL HOW SASSON\'S </p><p>OWN OCTOBER 16 VISIT HAD GONE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  TO MY ASTONISHMENT, TUVAL SAID THIS WAS SASSON\'S </p><p>FIRST "OFFICIAL" VISIT TO ALEXANDRIA IN THE OVER </p><p>FIVE YEARS HE HAS BEEN ISRAEL\'S AMBASSADOR TO CAIRO. </p><p>HE SAID SASSON HAD VISITED THE CITY IN CONNECTION </p><p>WITH BILATERAL MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER, OR TO ACCOMPANY DELEGATIONS. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE HAD NEVER CALLED ON THE GOVERNOR OR MET </p><p>WITH ALEXANDRIAN PERSONALITIES.  IN ANY EVENT, BOTH </p><p>HE AND SASSON WERE PLEASED WITH THE VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TUVAL SAID THE MEETING WITH GOVERNOR GAWSAQI </p><p>HAD GONE WELL.  I PROBED HIM A LITTLE ON THIS </p><p>POINT, AND HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS FRIENDLY, </p><p>EVINCED SUPPORT FOR GOOD EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI RELATIONS, </p><p>AND BASICALLY RESPONDED "INSHALLAH" (GOD WILLING) TO </p><p>THE ISRAELIS\' EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST IN EXPANDED </p><p>TRADE AND TOURISM.  AT A BUFFET LUNCH, TUVAL </p><p>INTRODUCED HIS AMBASSADOR TO OVER 40 LOCAL BUSINESSMEN, </p><p>TRAVEL AGENTS, ACADEMICS, AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS </p><p>IN CUSTOMS AND THE JUDICIARY WITH WHOM HE HAS HAD </p><p>OFFICIAL DEALINGS.  HE SAID HE WAS PLEASED BY BOTH </p><p>THE TURNOUT AND THE ENSUING  DISCUSSIONS.  NOTING </p><p>THAT HE HAS DIFFERED FREQUENTLY IN THE PAST WITH </p><p>SASSON\'S OFTEN DOUR DEPICTION OF EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI </p><p>RELATIONS, TUVAL SAID HIS AMBASSADOR HAD CONCEDED </p><p>THAT ALEXANDRIANS GENERALLY SEEM TO BE READIER TO </p><p>ACCEPT NORMALIZATION (OR AT LEAST TO MEET WITH </p><p>ISRAELIS)       THAN MANY IN CAIRO.  TUVAL ACCEPTED </p><p>MY POINT THAT CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF ALEXANDRIAN </p><p>SOCIETY (NOTABLY THE ISLAMIC RIGHT) PROBABLY DO NOT </p><p>SHARE THIS VIEW.  HOWEVER, HE SAID HE FEELS A </p><p>BROADER AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON </p><p>EGYPTIAN ATTITUDES IS AVAILABLE IN ALEXANDRIA, AND </p><p>HE HOPES OTHER ISRAELI EMBASSY OFFICERS WILL VISIT </p><p>THE CITY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>AVAILABLE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  ABOVE NOTWITHSTANDING, TUVAL COMPLAINED </p><p>ON NOVEMBER 4 ABOUT THE REFUSAL OF SENIOR GOVERNORATE </p><p>OFFICIALS TO ATTEND HIS FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THE ONE </p><p>FOR SASSON.  HE ALLEGED THAT CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT </p><p>EZZAT KADDOUS HAD TOLD HIM UNOFFICIALLY SOME TIME </p><p>AGO THAT THIS IS DONE TO "SIYASSAT AL-IMTINA\'", AN </p><p>OFFICIALLY CONDONED "ABSTENTION POLICY."  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AT HIS MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR, TUVAL SAID </p><p>HE RAISED THE QUESTION OF THE TWO ISRAELI SAILORS </p><p>WHO WERE DETAINED IN EGYPT (RELEASED ON THEIR OWN </p><p>RECOGNIZANCE) IN FEBRUARY 1986 WHILE THEIR CASE </p><p>(ALLEGED HASHISH SMUGGLING) WAS CONSIDERED BY THE </p><p>LOCAL COURTS (SEE REFTEL).  THEY WERE FOUND "NOT </p><p>GUILTY" IN EARLY OCTOBER BUT ARE STILL UNABLE TO </p><p>LEAVE EGYPT UNTIL THE DECISION IS REVIEWED.  TUVAL </p><p>ASKED THE GOVERNOR TO INTERVENE OR AT LEAST USE </p><p>HIS GOOD OFFICES TO EXPEDITE MATTERS, BUT THE </p><p>LATTER DECLINED.  HE EVINCED IRRITATION THAT GAWSAQI, </p><p>WHO IS A JUDGE BY TRAINING, WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE A </p><p>CLEAR EXPLANATION OF WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE VERDICT </p><p>REVIEW PROCESS.  AT NOVEMBER 4 DINNER, TUVAL WAS </p><p>EVEN MORE PERPLEXED THAT THE SAILORS HAD STILL NOT </p><p>BEEN REMOVED FROM THE DEPARTURE "BLACKLIST" BECAUSE OF </p><p>CONTINUING BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS.  HE EXPRESSED THE </p><p>HOPE THE CASE WOULD NOT BECOME A BILATERAL ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POST SUMMIT DEVELOPMENTS: </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>8.  I ASKED TUVAL IF HE HAD DETECTED ANY CHANGES IN </p><p>LOCAL ATTITUDES TOWARD ISRAEL SINCE THE SEPTEMBER </p><p>SUMMIT.  HE SAID HE FOUND THE FEW GOVERNORATE </p><p>OFFICIALS HE MEETS REGULARLY TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE </p><p>RELAXED IN HIS PRESENCE.  ALSO, HIS CONSULATE HAS </p><p>RECEIVED A RECENT INCREASE IN INQUIRIES FROM LOCAL </p><p>TRAVEL AGENTS ABOUT TOURISM, AND HE HAS MET WITH </p><p>ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM A LOCAL TRAVEL AGENCY. </p><p>HOWEVER, TUVAL SAID HE DOES NOT EXPECT ANY UPSURGE </p><p>IN EGYPTIAN SIGHTSEERS.  HE IS HOPEFUL, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT A LARGER NUMBER OF JEWISH PILGRIMS WILL ATTEND </p><p>THIS YEAR\'S COMMEMORATIVE BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS AT </p><p>THE TOMB OF THE VENERATED 19TH CENTURY RABBI YACOUB </p><p>ABU HASIRAH NEAR DAMANHOUR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ZIM LINES: </p><p>---------- </p><p>9.  ZIM CONTINUES TO DO ADEQUATELY IN ALEXANDRIA, </p><p>DESPITE EGYPT\'S CURRENT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND </p><p>THE FALLOFF IN TRADE.  ALTHOUGH I DID NOT RAISE THIS </p><p>SUBJECT WITH TUVAL, THE COMPANY\'S LOCAL AGENT SAID </p><p>RECENTLY THAT ZIM NOW OFFERS A CONTAINER SERVICE </p><p>TWICE MONTHLY.  BUSINESS WITH EAST ASIA IS PARTICULARLY </p><p>GOOD.  EACH SHIP IS ALSO ABLE TO PICK UP FROM 50 TO 60 </p><p>CONTAINERS ON EACH OUTWARD VOYAGE, AN ACHIEVEMENT THE </p><p>AGENT IS ESPECIALLY PROUD OF.  LEADING EXPORTS </p><p>CARRIED BY ZIM INCLUDE COTTON AND TEXTILES, USUALLY OF </p><p>ASIAN OR EUROPEAN DESTINATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DELTA AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES: </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>10.  TUVAL SAID ISRAEL HAS TWO ONGOING AGRICULTURAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN THE DELTA.  THE OLDEST IS THE TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROJECT UNDERTAKEN BY AN EXPERT NAMED </p><p>KEIDAR (RESIDENT IN CAIRO) AT A FARM NEAR TANTA. </p><p>(THERE IS ONE ZVI KEIDAR ON THE ISRAELI EMBASSY </p><p>DIP LIST WHO MAY BE THE EXPERT MENTIONED.)  A VERY </p><p>RECENT UNDERTAKING IS A JOINT GOVERNMENT-TO- </p><p>GOVERNMENT AGRICULTURAL VENTURE NEAR THE DELTA TOWN </p><p>OF GIANCLIS.  TUVAL SAID THIS PROJECT IS ALSO </p><p>GOING WELL AND THAT A RESIDENT EXPERT IS PRESENT, </p><p>BUT HE DID NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS. (COMMENT: </p><p>I ASKED IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO VISIT THESE </p><p>TWO PROJECTS SOME DAY AS BOTH ARE IN MY CONSULAR </p><p>DISTRICT.  TUVAL SAID NO.  EVEN HE AND OTHER </p><p>ISRAELIS ARE NOT NORMALLY ALLOWED TO VISIT THE SITES </p><p>IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR "LOW PROFILE" NATURE. </p><p>HOWEVER, TUVAL SAID HE HOPES TO VISIT THEM WITH </p><p>AMBASSADOR SASSON IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND WOULD BRIEF </p><p>ME AT THAT TIME.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  ANOTHER AGRICULTURALLY-REALTED PROJECT WE ARE </p><p>AWARE OF IS PURELY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND IS </p><p>DIRECTED BY ONE BENNY DUMAI (PHONETIC), A RESIDENT </p><p>OF CAIRO, WHO HAS HAD SOME SUCCESS IN INTRODUCING </p><p>ISRAELI DRIP IRRIGATION TECHNIQUES TO PRIVATE </p><p>EGYPTIAN ENTREPRENEURS.  ONE SUCH ENTREPRENEUR IS </p><p>AN ALEXANDRIAN WHO HAS USED DUMAI\'S TECHNOLOGY TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE CULTIVATION OF PEARS AND OTHER FRUIT </p><p>ON HIS FARM IN THE CITY\'S SUBURBS.  THIS EGYPTIAN </p><p>WAS FULSOME IN HIS PRAISE FOR DUMAI, HIS TECHNOLOGY, </p><p>AND WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR HIS FARM.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>HE NOTED THAT DUMAI WORKS VERY QUIETLY AND WITHOUT </p><p>MUCH PUBLICITY (TUVAL SAID HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE </p><p>NAME).  THE EGYPTIAN LIKEWISE FEELS HE MUST BE </p><p>DISCREET IN HIS DEALINGS WITH THE ISRAELIS (HE WORKS </p><p>AT AIN SHAMS UNIVERSITY).  HE HAS EVEN TAKEN THE </p><p>PRECAUTION OF PUTTING A WALL AROUND THE MAIN CONTROL </p><p>UNIT FOR HIS IRRIGATION SYSTEM TO PREVENT OUTSIDERS </p><p>FROM SEEING THE HEBREW LETTERING ON THE MACHINERY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COTTON: </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE ISRAELIS ARE APPARENTLY INVOLVED IN SOME </p><p>COTTON DEALINGS HERE AS WELL.  TUVAL IS HAZY ON THE </p><p>DETAILS BUT HE RECALLS THAT SOMEONE FROM EILAT (PERHAPS </p><p>NAMED "MUKKI;" TUVAL SAID HE WOULD TRY TO CHECK) </p><p>BEING INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH AN ALEXANDRIA- </p><p>BASED PUBLIC SECTOR COTTON COMPANY TO TRADE OR SELL </p><p>ISRAELI SHORT FIBER COTTON IN EXCHANGE FOR EGYPT\'S </p><p>MUCH PRIZED LONG FIBER VARIETY.  (COMMENT:  U.S. </p><p>COTTON PRODUCERS HAVE A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT WHICH IS </p><p>PROFITABLE AND ADVANTAGEOUS FOR BOTH OF THE PARTIES </p><p>INVOLVED.  WE WILL REPORT ON DETAILS ABOUT THE </p><p>ISRAELI ARRANGEMENTS AS AVAILABLE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>ISRAELI CONGEN ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE ALEXANDRIA: </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>13.  TUVAL\'S CONSULAR DISTRICT INCLUDES FOR PROVINCES: </p><p>ALEXANDRIA, BUHAYRA, KAFR AL-SHAYKH, AND DAQAHILIYAH </p><p>(MANSURA).  THUS FAR, HE HAS ONLY VISITED THE </p><p>BUHAYRA IN THE HINTERLAND, PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THE </p><p>GOVERNORS OF KAFR AL-SHAYKH AND DAQAHILIYAH HAVE </p><p>NEVER RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR APPOINTMENTS.  HE </p><p>SAID HE PLANS TO TRY TO CALL ON THEM WITHOUT </p><p>APPOINTMENTS SOMETIME BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TUVAL\'S FUTURE: </p><p>-------------- </p><p>14.  TUVAL\'S SUBORDINATES HAVE MENTIONED RECENTLY </p><p>TO FRIENDS ON CONGEN STAFF THAT TUVAL WILL BE </p><p>LEAVING HIS POST IN EARLY 1987.  ISRAELI MFA IS </p><p>ALLEGED TO BE LOOKING FOR A SUCCESSOR WHO IS </p><p>"PUBLIC RELATIONS MINDED."  THE ZIM LINE AGENT HAS </p><p>ALSO TOLD US THAT TUVAL MAY BE DEPARTING "SOON." </p><p>TUVAL HIMSELF IS MUM ON THE SUBJECT. ASKED NOVEMBER 4 </p><p>HOW LONG A NORMAL TOUR OF DUTY IS, TUVAL (WHO ARRIVED </p><p>IN 1984) REPLIED "THREE TO FOUR YEARS." </p><p> </p><p>15.  COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH I SEE TUVAL ON A REGULAR </p><p>BASIS, AND WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP, THE MEETINGS </p><p>ARE USUALLY AT MY INITIATIVE.  TUVAL IS NOT AS ACTIVE </p><p>AS HIS PREDECESSOR AND PROBABLY HAS NOT OPENED AS </p><p>MANY DOORS AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE.  THE SEPARATION </p><p>FROM HIS FAMILY (RESIDENT IN JERUSALEM FOR SCHOOLING) </p><p>HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL IN THIS REGARD.  ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>HE IS PLEASANT, NOT PUSHY, AND HAS GONE OUT OF HIS </p><p>WAY TO UNDERSTAND EGYPTIAN VIEWPOINTS AND PUT DOMESTIC </p><p>EVENTS IN EGYPT INTO A BROADER CONTEXT.  IT IS </p><p>APPARENT THAT HE IS NEITHER HELPED NOR ENCOURAGED BY </p><p>HIS EMBASSY IN CAIRO IN HIS VARIOUS UNDERTAKINGS. </p><p>HE CONSULTS REGULARLY, BUT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE KEPT </p><p>IN THE INFORMATION LOOP.  WITHOUT HIS AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>FULL UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT, IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE </p><p>HOW HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO DO MUCH BETTER AS A </p><p>WELL-INFORMED AND EFFECTIVE PROPONENT OF IMPROVED </p><p>EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI TIES.  TUVAL IS ASSISTED IN HIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAMBLEY </p><p></p></div>
