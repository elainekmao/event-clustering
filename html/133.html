<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 07641 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, TU, IR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAN-IRAQ:  IRAQI DEBT REPAYMENT AND </p><p>       KHOMEINI\'S AIMS IN THE REGION </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY:  TURKEY IS CONSIDERING THE TERMS OF </p><p>REPAYMENT OF IRAQI DEBTS, THE MFA OFFICIAL </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAN AND IRAQ , ONDER OZAR, SAID </p><p>RECENTLY.  ACCORDING TO THE MFA ASSISTANT DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL FOR THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA, KHOMEINI NOT </p><p>ONLY WANTS TO OUST SADDAM HUSSEIN, HE IS DETERMINED </p><p>TO ESTABLISH ISLAMIC REGIMES THROUGHOUT THE REGION, </p><p>INCLUDING TURKEY.  PM OZAL APPARENTLY IS LESS </p><p>CONCERNED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DURING A RECENT CALL ON THE MFA OFFICIAL </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAN AND IRAQ, ONDER OZAR, ON ANOTHER </p><p>SUBJECT, POLCOUNS ASKED WHETHER TURKEY HAD DECIDED TO </p><p>EXTEND TERMS FOR REPAYMENT OF THE CURRENT IRAQI DEBT </p><p>AND THE ADDITIONAL CREDITS BAGHDAD IS SEEKING.  OZAR </p><p>SAID THAT PRIME MINISTER OZAL\'S TOP STAFF HAD MET TO </p><p>CONSIDER THE CREDIT ISSUE ON SUNDAY, JULY 13, BUT </p><p>THAT HE HAD NOT YET LEARNED THE OUTCOME OF THEIR </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  HE SAID THAT A TURKISH DELEGATION WOULD </p><p>SOON BE DISCUSSING THE QUESTION IN BAGHDAD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO UNCONFIRMED PRESS REPORTS OF JULY </p><p>18, THE TWO COUNTRIES REACHED AGREEMENT ON REPAYMENT </p><p>TERMS ON JULY 17.  IRAQ IS TO PAY 700 MILLION DOLLARS </p><p>OF THE OUTSTANDING 1.5 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND </p><p>THE BALANCE, DEFERRED FOR ONE YEAR, WILL BE PAID IN </p><p>THE FORM OF OIL IMPORTS TO TURKEY.  FYI:  A HIGH </p><p>LEVEL TEAM LED BY UNDER SECRETARY PAKDEMIRLI SPENT </p><p>JULY 16-20 IN BAGHDAD.  EMBASSY IS SEEKING AN </p><p>APPOINTMENT WITH AN APPROPRIATE MFA OFFICIAL FOR A </p><p>READOUT.  END FYI. </p><p> </p><p>5. OZAR WAS SURPRISINGLY SANGUINE OVER SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN\'S PROSPECTS FOR STAYING IN POWER FOR THE </p><p>FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  HE NOTED THAT THE KEY ISSUE FOR </p><p>BOTH WARRING STATES, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR IRAQI MORALE, </p><p>WAS NOT WHAT HE CALLED THE INDECISIVE MILITARY </p><p>SITUATION, BUT DOMESTIC CONDITIONS AND THE STATE OF </p><p>THE ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>6. OZAR\'S BOSS, MFA ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA, TEOMAN SURENKOK (PLEASE </p><p>PROTECT), SOUNDED LESS CONFIDENT WHEN HE TOLD </p><p>POLCOUNS HIS JUDGMENT THAT KHOMEINI WOULD NOT BE </p><p>CONTENT MERELY TO OUST SADDAM HUSSEIN, BUT WAS </p><p>DETERMINED TO ESTABLISH A REGIME LIKE HIS OWN IN </p><p>IRAQ, AND THROUGHOUT THE REGION, "INCLUDING TURKEY." </p><p>SURENKOK WENT ON TO SAY, "WE HAVE TOLD THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER THAT THIS IS A DANGER FOR TURKEY, BUT HE </p><p>DISAGREES." </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT:  THE TURKS HAVE AN INTEREST IN AVOIDING </p><p>AN ALARMING VIEW OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE WAR </p><p>WHICH MIGHT PREJUDICE THEIR CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH </p><p>IRAQ OVER CREDIT TERMS.  AT THE SAME TIME THE GOT </p><p>WANTS TO AVOID INDICATIONS THAT THEIR SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>STAKES IN IRAQ--INCLUDING THE PIPELINE AND OVER A </p><p>BILLION DOLLARS IN OUTSTANDING DEBT--MIGHT BE IN </p><p>JEOPARDY. </p><p> </p><p>STRAUSZ-HUPE </p><p></p></div>
