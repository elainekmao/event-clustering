<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002206 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11-29-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, PREL, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  LTTE leader Prabhakaran\'s annual hero\'s day </p><p>speech was a mixed bag of positive and negative comments </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Colombo 2195 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, DCM.  Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On November 27 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) leader Velupillai Prabhakaran made his annual </p><p>"Hero\'s Day" speech.  The government of Sri Lanka has </p><p>commented favorably on the speech, highlighting </p><p>Prabhakaran\'s acceptance of regional autonomy instead of </p><p>a separate state.  Prabhakaran\'s willingness to commit </p><p>to a goal less than independent Eelam on the day </p><p>commemorating the "heroes" that have died trying to </p><p>establish Eelam is a significant positive sign.  The </p><p>address was not entirely positive, however.  Prabhakaran </p><p>indicated that if LTTE demands were not met, it would </p><p>have no choice but to secede from Sri Lanka.  He also </p><p>noted that the Tigers would go back to using violence if </p><p>necessary.  A copy of the text was faxed to SA/INS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Some of the positive aspects of the speech </p><p>included the following statements: </p><p> </p><p>-- We are prepared to consider favorably a political </p><p>framework that offers substantial regional autonomy and </p><p>self-government in our homeland on the basis of our </p><p>right to internal self-determination. </p><p> </p><p>-- If a reasonable settlement to the Tamil national </p><p>question could be realized by peaceful means we will </p><p>make every endeavor, with honesty and sincerity to </p><p>pursue that path. </p><p> </p><p>-- The present government has been taking concrete </p><p>actions redressing the urgent and immediate problems of </p><p>our people. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Some of the negative aspects of the speech </p><p>included the following statements: </p><p> </p><p>-- If our demand for regional self-rule is rejected we </p><p>have no alternative other than to secede and form an </p><p>independent state. </p><p> </p><p>-- If the Sinhala chauvinistic forces, for their own </p><p>petty political reasons scuttle this peace effort ... </p><p>the Tamil people will be compelled to pursue the path of </p><p>secession and political independence. </p><p> </p><p>-- The military occupation is suffocating the civilian </p><p>masses and causing tensions.  Jaffna, which is the </p><p>cultural heartland of the Tamil people, has turned into </p><p>an open prison. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Mission plans on using the following "if </p><p>asked" press guidance: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>The United States has carefully reviewed the annual </p><p>address delivered on November 27 by Velupillai </p><p>Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE). </p><p> </p><p>We are encouraged by Mr. Prabhakaran\'s assertion that </p><p>regional autonomy -- and not separatism -- is the goal </p><p>of the LTTE.  We also welcome the expressions of support </p><p>for the peace process and for Norway\'s facilitation </p><p>effort. </p><p> </p><p>Regrettably, Mr. Prabhakaran ignored the opportunity of </p><p>this annual message to renounce violence, warning </p><p>rather, that the LTTE would return to terrorism -- and </p><p>to its original objective of an Eelam -- if it is unable </p><p>to achieve its aspirations through dialogue.  We </p><p>emphasize once again that the international community is </p><p>awaiting the LTTE\'s renunciation of violence. </p><p> </p><p>As our Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage said </p><p>in Oslo, we urge the LTTE to make a "public renunciation </p><p>of terrorism and of violence - to make it clear to the </p><p>people of Sri Lanka and indeed to the international </p><p>community -- that the LTTE has abandoned its armed </p><p>struggle for a separate state; and instead accepts the </p><p>sovereignty of a Sri Lankan government that respects and </p><p>protects the rights of all its people." </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
