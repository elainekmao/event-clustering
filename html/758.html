<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BUENOS AIRES 004491 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  7/25/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, LY, AR </p><p>SUBJECT: QADHAFI\'S SON VISITS MENEM, TALKS SOCCER AND </p><p>A LITTLE BUSINESS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) BUENOS AIRES 289, (B) BUENOS AIRES 247 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: QADHAFI\'S 25-YEAR OLD SON ALSADI AND AN </p><p>ENTOURAGE OF FIVE OR SIX UNIDENTIFIED LIBYAN OFFICIALS </p><p>ARRIVED IN ARGENTINA LATE LAST WEEK AND WAS RECEIVED </p><p>BY PRESIDENT MENEM AT THE OLIVOS RESIDENCE ON JULY </p><p>24.  GOA OFFICIALS STRESS THAT QADHAFI\'S VISIT WAS </p><p>COMPLETELY PRIVATE.  DESPITE SOME PRESS SPECULATION </p><p>ABOUT A "THAWING" IN ARGENTINA\'S RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>PARIAH STATE, QADHAFI THE YOUNGER REPORTEDLY TOUCHED </p><p>ON LITTLE OR NO SUBSTANCE DURING THE TWENTY-FIVE </p><p>MINUTES HE SPENT WITH ARGENTINA\'S HEAD OF STATE;  MOST </p><p>OF THEIR TIME TOGETHER REPORTEDLY WAS DEVOTED TO </p><p>CHIT-CHAT ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SPORTS WORLD.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN A MEETING LASTING LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR, </p><p>PRESIDENT MENEM RECEIVED THE SON OF LIBYAN LEADER </p><p>MUAMMAR AL-QADHAFI, ALSADI MUAMMAR AL-QADHAFI, AT HIS </p><p>OFFICIAL RESIDENCE WHILE THE LATTER WAS ON A "PRIVATE </p><p>VISIT" ARGENTINA.  OSTENSIBLY HERE TO DISCUSS </p><p>BROADENING BILATERAL COMMERCE, QADHAFI\'S SON FOLLOWED </p><p>BY ABOUT SIX MONTHS AN UNSUCCESSFUL MISSION BY A </p><p>QADHAFI ENVOY SEEKING ARGENTINE SUPPORT FOR EASING </p><p>SANCTIONS ON LIBYA IMPOSED BY THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>(REPORTED REFTELS).  AS REPORTED IN LOCAL PRESS, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE SHORT AUDIENCE WITH MENEM PRODUCED THE </p><p>SAME FROSTY RESULTS AS THE JANUARY VISIT.  MENEM\'S </p><p>PENCHANT FOR SPORTS AND DISCUSSION OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SOCCER COMPETITION -- AND PERHAPS A DESIRE TO AVOID </p><p>TOO MUCH SUBSTANCE -- APPARENTLY CAPTURED THE BULK OF </p><p>THE CONVERSATION.  DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER PETRELLA </p><p>AND A LIBYAN "COMMERCIAL AFFAIRS OFFICER" ALSO </p><p>ATTENDED THE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  POLOFF CALLED ON JOSE LUIS MIGNINI, SUBDIRECTOR </p><p>FOR NORTH AFRICA AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, JULY 25 TO </p><p>GET A READ OUT ON THE MEETING AND TO ENQUIRE ABOUT </p><p>CURRENT RELATIONS BETWEEN ARGENTINA AND LIBYA. </p><p>MIGNINI SAID HE HAD LITTLE LIGHT TO SHED ON THE </p><p>MEETING AS PETRELLA\'S OFFICE WAS NOT DIVULGING DETAILS </p><p>OF THE DISCUSSION.  HE SPECULATED THAT PRESS REPORTS </p><p>HAD CAPTURED THE ESSENCE OF THE CONVERSATION AS NO </p><p>CHANGES IN ARGENTINA\'S POSITION REGARDING LIBYA\'S </p><p>STATUS IN THE WORLD COMMUNITY WERE ANTICIPATED.  IN A </p><p>SEPARATE CONVERSATION, PETRELLA\'S CHIEF OF CABINET ANA </p><p>MARIA RAMIREZ CONFIRMED THAT THE CONVERSATION DWELLED </p><p>ON PROTOCOL.  THIS WAS THE YOUTHFUL QADHAFI\'S FIRST </p><p>VISIT TO LATIN AMERICA, ACCORDING TO RAMIREZ, AND HE </p><p>BROUGHT NO MESSAGES FROM HIS GOVERNMENT.  SHE </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT SPORTS DOMINATED THE DISCUSSION. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT.  DESPITE THE HOOPLA IN THE PRESS -- ONE </p><p>PAPER PAINTED THE MEETING AS A LOGICAL FOLLOW-ON TO </p><p>MENEM\'S VISIT TO SYRIA IN A COORDINATED EFFORT TO </p><p>REESTABLISH WARMER TIES TO ARAB COUNTRIES AFTER </p><p>ARGENTINE PARTICIPATION IN THE GULF WAR -- LITTLE </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE CHANGED AFTER QADHAFI\'S VISIT. </p><p>ARGENTINA\'S COMMITMENT TO UN SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA </p><p>APPEARS UNWAVERING EVEN IF PRESIDENT MENEM ALSO SEEMS </p><p>UNABLE TO RESIST MEETING WITH "CELEBRITIES" RANGING </p><p>FROM THE ROLLING STONES TO QADHAFI\'S SON. </p><p> </p><p>GODARD </p><p></p></div>
