<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001636 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CA, NDP </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA PROVINCIAL ELECTION: MANITOBA RE-ELECTS NEW </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PARTY (NDP) </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Ottawa 01325 </p><p> </p><p>THIS MESSAGE IS A PRODUCT OF APP WINNIPEG. </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY.  As expected, Manitoba Premier Gary Doer and his </p><p>left-of-center New Democratic Party (NDP) won a second </p><p>majority government in the June 3 elections. The Manitoba </p><p>NDP is a strong proponent of the Canadian Wheat Board </p><p>monopoly and a driving force behind Canadian opposition to </p><p>U.S. proposals to alleviate flooding of North Dakota\'s </p><p>Devils Lake.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>No Major Campaign Issues </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  The campaign featured no major issues and registered </p><p>relatively little enthusiasm among the Manitoba electorate. </p><p>Though voter turnout dipped to 55 percent (the norm is 69 </p><p>percent), observers of Manitoba politics say the "low" </p><p>turnout is a sign of satisfaction with the status quo. </p><p>Aided by a strong economy and low unemployment rate, the </p><p>ruling NDP gained 3 new seats in the Legislature. </p><p>Preliminary results showed the NDP winning 49 percent of the </p><p>popular vote (vs. 44 percent in 1999).  With 20 seats and 36 </p><p>percent of the vote, the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party </p><p>will remain the official Opposition party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>No Change for U.S. Interests </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  We expect little change for U.S. interests in Manitoba </p><p>under the second Doer government.  Manitoba will continue to </p><p>be a driving force behind Canadian opposition to inter-basin </p><p>water transfers (Devils Lake, NAWS, etc.) and support for </p><p>the Canadian Wheat Board headquartered in Winnipeg.  At the </p><p>same time, Gary Doer places a premium on Manitoba\'s </p><p>relationship with the United States, which is the </p><p>destination for nearly 80% of Manitoba\'s exports.  He has </p><p>been successful in quashing some of the anti-American </p><p>rhetoric within the provincial party, and was visibly absent </p><p>earlier this year when some of his Cabinet and Caucus joined </p><p>protests opposing U.S. military action in Iraq.  Rarely is </p><p>the blatant anti-Americanism of the federal NDP publicly </p><p>manifested in Manitoba\'s NDP, though the sentiment is </p><p>present. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Premier enjoys close personal relations with </p><p>Ambassador Cellucci and the leaders of several states </p><p>(Minnesota, Missouri, Texas, South Dakota).  He will press </p><p>ahead with further development of Manitoba hydroelectricity </p><p>generation potential, and actively solicit U.S. markets for </p><p>surplus hydroelectricity. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT.  The NDP conducted a cautious campaign.  In </p><p>resisting some pressure to adopt a more "leftist" agenda, </p><p>the party was able to hold greater appeal for the middle- </p><p>class suburban voters that tend to decide Manitoba </p><p>elections.  Premier Doer\'s personal popularity and his image </p><p>as a centrist politician were key factors in enabling the </p><p>NDP to steal three suburban Winnipeg seats from Conservative </p><p>incumbents, as well as one open Conservative seat.  Though </p><p>the NDP made province-wide gains in the popular vote, </p><p>however, it failed to make any significant breakthrough into </p><p>the PC\'s rural base. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
