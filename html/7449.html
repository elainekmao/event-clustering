<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001813 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/RA and DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/14/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MFA MINSTATE HAMDAN BIN ZAYID ON </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE UAE: SOONER </p><p>BETTER THAN LATER </p><p> </p><p>REF:  DUBAI 1318 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a 4/13 meeting, the Ambassador asked </p><p>for MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid\'s opinion on </p><p>Dubai\'s recent decision to establish elected </p><p>district councils.  Hamdan briefed that de facto </p><p>Dubai Ruler Shaykh Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktoum </p><p>(MbR) had not consulted with the Abu Dhabi </p><p>leadership and hinted the decision had come as a </p><p>complete surprise.  Furthermore, Hamdan sniffed, </p><p>Abu Dhabi had not had time to folow-up the matter </p><p>with Dubai, as the leadership was far too busy </p><p>following events in Iraq.  (Note:  President Zayid </p><p>recently had a meeting with MBR, and the Dubai </p><p>rumor mill has it that Zayid asked MbR for an </p><p>explanation.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hamdan told the Ambassador that he was among </p><p>those favoring an early move to democratization in </p><p>the UAE, consonant with the country\'s traditional </p><p>cultural, religious and social norms.  As he put </p><p>it, "better we do it our way rather than waiting </p><p>for the Americans to pressure us later into doing </p><p>it their way."  It would be a nice legacy for </p><p>Shaykh Zayid, in Hamdan\'s view, and with Zayid\'s </p><p>imprimatur, the move to democratization would be </p><p>more widely accepted.  (Note:  The implication </p><p>being that Zayid\'s successor, Abu Dhabi Crown </p><p>Prince Khalifa, may encounter greater resistance </p><p>from conservatives.  End Note.)  Lending some </p><p>urgency to the matter is the fact that all of the </p><p>other states in the region, even the Saudis, are </p><p>opening up politically, Hamdan noted. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The situation in the UAE, Hamdan explained, </p><p>is different than in other Gulf states and </p><p>therefore the leadership needs to proceed somewhat </p><p>cautiously.  For instance, the population </p><p>distribution (Emiratis comprise only 20 percent of </p><p>the overall population) and the fact that fifty </p><p>percent of Emirati nationals are naturalized </p><p>citizens must be taken into consideration.  The UAE </p><p>wants to avoid the pitfalls of others in the </p><p>region, namely Kuwait, where until recently, </p><p>naturalized citizens could not vote.  In addition, </p><p>Hamdan believes the UAE should start small, i.e. </p><p>elected local bodies, rather than immediately </p><p>moving to an elected federal parliament.  In his </p><p>opinion, the Oman model is worthy of emulation. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  Reading between the lines, Dubai\'s </p><p>announcement came as a bombshell to Abu Dhabi. </p><p>Once again, the upstart Al-Maktoum have scooped the </p><p>more staid, conservative Al-Nahyan, in a move which </p><p>sends a dual message.  One is that Dubai, Inc. is </p><p>exercising its right to run its own affairs, </p><p>without the prior approval of Abu Dhabi.  We note </p><p>that Sharjah did the same when it decided to </p><p>appoint women to its consultative council two years </p><p>ago.  The second message is intended for a much </p><p>wider local, regional and international audience </p><p>and is part of Dubai\'s effort to project an image </p><p>of a progressive, forward leaning city-state led by </p><p>a dynamic family.  Dubai\'s leadership is intensely </p><p>aware that its continued prosperity depends on </p><p>attracting foreign investment, and it realizes that </p><p>some measure of political openness is viewed as </p><p>desirable by major investors, especially when other </p><p>regional competitors (Bahrain and Qatar) are </p><p>implementing more progressive political systems. </p><p>We also note that it is not unusual for the press </p><p>savvy Dubyyans to make a dramatic announcement -- </p><p>utterly devoid of substance -- the details of which </p><p>will be filled in at a later date.  Stay tuned. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) This cable was coordinated with Amconsul </p><p>Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
