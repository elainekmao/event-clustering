OVERALL, CHI SAID THE GVN VIEWED THE MEETING </p><p>AS "VERY SUCCESSFUL."  ASEAN MEMBERS "WERE PLEASED TO SEE </p><p>THAT SECRETARY POWELL CAME TO THE MEETING WITH A "THICK </p><p>BOOK" OUTLINING US ONGOING PROJECTS IN ASIA, WHICH </p><p>DEMONSTRATED USG COMMITMENT TO THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  CHI SPECIFICALLY POINTED TO THE ASEAN-U.S. JOINT </p><p>DECLARATION ON COUNTER TERRORISM, SIGNED AUGUST 1, AS THE </p><p>MEETING\'S "MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT."  CHI NOTED THAT, </p><p>REGARDING COUNTER TERRORISM, "ASEAN AND THE U.S. UNDERSTAND </p><p>EACH OTHER WELL AND THAT ASEAN IS DETERMINED TO WORK WITH </p><p>THE USG\'S CONCERNS."  CHI PREDICTED THAT NEXT MONTH\'S ASEM </p><p>SUMMIT WOULD INCLUDE A SIMILAR, THOUGH "SOMEWHAT WEAKER," </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01990  01 OF 02  091047Z </p><p>DECLARATION.  CHI SAID IT WAS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE PARTIES </p><p>REACHED A CONSENSUS THREE DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THE </p><p>MEETING.  TO EXPEDITE REACHING CONSENSUS, CERTAIN SPECIFICS </p><p>SUCH AS INTELLIGENCE SHARING WERE OMITTED FROM THE </p><p>DECLARATION BECAUSE SUCH ISSUES TOUCHED ON SOVEREIGNTY </p><p>CONCERNS AND WOULD HAVE REQUIRED CONSULTATIONS WITH HOME </p><p>MINISTRIES.  CHI DOWNPLAYED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SUCH </p><p>OMISSIONS, HOWEVER, NOTING THAT HE "EXPECTS SUCH COOPERATION </p><p>WILL OCCUR." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>"POSITIVE" NIEN-POWELL MEETING </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  CHI SAID THE FOREIGN MINISTER NIEN AND SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL HELD A "VERY POSITIVE" 20-MINUTE MEETING ON JULY </p><p>31ST.  CHI CHARACTERIZED THE MEETING AS "FORMAL, NOT PULL- </p><p>ASIDE."  ACCORDING TO CHI, NIEN RAISED SEVERAL ISSUES, </p><p>INCLUDING BTA IMPLEMENTATION, PERMANENT REMOVAL OF THE </p><p>JACKSON-VANIK WAIVER, AND SETTING UP OF "A PERMANENT </p><p>MECHANISM" BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM FOR SETTLING ISSUES </p><p>SUCH AS CATFISH.  CHI SAID SECRETARY POWELL TOLD NIEN HE </p><p>VIEWED THE CATFISH ISSUE AS NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY; THE </p><p>SECRETARY DID NOT COMMENT ON THE OTHER ISSUES RAISED.  NIEN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ALSO MENTIONED TO THE SECRETARY THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA </p><p>FOR PRIME MINISTER KHAI TO MEET PRESIDENT BUSH AT THE APEC </p><p>MEETING SCHEDULED FOR THIS NOVEMBER IN MEXICO.  CHI ALSO </p><p>REPORTED THAT SECRETARY POWELL TOLD NIEN THAT HE HOPED THEY </p><p>COULD MEET AGAIN IN NEW YORK AT THE UPCOMING 57TH UN GENERAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01990  01 OF 02  091047Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>CODE OF CONDUCT-PROGRESS BUT STILL A LONG ROAD AHEAD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  IN A MEETING WITH EMBOFFS LAST MAY (REFTEL B), CHI </p><p>EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT THE DECLARATION OF THE SOUTH CHINA </p><p>SEA CODE OF CONDUCT (COC) WOULD BE ADOPTED AT THE BRUNEI </p><p>MEETING.  THIS DID NOT OCCUR.  CHI SAID THERE IS STILL NOT A </p><p>CONSENSUS ON THE SCOPE.  THE STICKING POINT IS THAT MALAYSIA </p><p>WANTS TO INCLUDE ONLY THE AREA AROUND THE SPRATLEY ISLANDS, </p><p>WHILE OTHER ASEAN MEMBERS (AND THE PRC) WANT TO INCLUDE ALL </p><p>THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AREA.  THAT SAID, CHI OPINED THAT THE </p><p>PRC IN PARTICULAR "WAS ANXIOUS TO SIGN A COC."  CHI SAID </p><p>THAT ASEAN IS "WORKING TOWARDS A CONSENSUS" TO BREAK THE </p><p>DEADLOCK BY LEAVING THE SCOPE ISSUE OUT OF THE TEXT BUT </p><p>INCLUDE IT IN THE DOCUMENT\'S TITLE.  ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS, MALAYSIA AND VIETNAM DISAGREED OVER THE TITLE, AS </p><p>WELL, THOUGH VIETNAM EVENTUALLY RELENTED.  ACCORDING TO CHI </p><p>AND PRESS REPORTS, THE DECLARATION\'S WORDING (ORIGINALLY </p><p>DRAFTED BY THE PHILIPPINES) WILL BE "REFINED" OVER THE NEXT </p><p>FEW MONTHS AND THEN SIGNED AT THE ASEAN SUMMIT THAT WILL BE </p><p>HELD THIS NOVEMBER IN CAMBODIA.

(U)  ACCORDING TO CHI, ASEAN MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS </p><p>REGARDING MEASURES TO NARROW THE DEVELOPMENT GAP AMONG THE </p><p>ASEAN MEMBERS AND TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF NEW (AND </p><p>SEPARATE) FREE TRADE AREAS (FTA) WITH, CHINA, JAPAN AND </p><p>SOUTH KOREA, RESPECTIVELY.  SINGAPORE IN PARTICULAR WANTS TO </p><p>SEE AN ACCELERATED EFFORT TO DIMINISH THE DEVELOPMENT GAP, </p><p>AND "IS GROWING INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED BY THE SLOWER </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF ASEAN\'S NEWEST MEMBERS," ACCORDING TO CHI. </p><p>CHI COMMENTED THAT ASEAN AND THE PRC WERE "SLOWLY MOVING </p><p>FORWARD" ON THIS ISSUE AFTER WITNESSING THE SUCCESS OF NAFTA </p><p>AND THE EU.  CHI WAS LESS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT AN FTA WITH </p><p>JAPAN.  JAPAN STILL FAVORS BILATERAL COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC </p><p>PARTNERSHIPS RATHER THAN A MULTILATERAL FTA WITH ASEAN AS A </p><p>WHOLE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>PROLIFERATION OF PLUSES </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  IN THE COMING MONTH\'S ASEAN WILL LOOK TO EXPANDING </p><p>UPON THE SUCCESS OF ITS "+ 3" RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA, JAPAN </p><p>AND SOUTH KOREA BY PUSHING FOR THE ENHANCEMENT AND CREATION </p><p>OF NEWER "+" RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER SIGNIFICANT PARTNERS. </p><p>CHI SAID HE "WAS PLEASED TO NOTE" THAT THERE WILL BE AN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01990  02 OF 02  091048Z </p><p>ASEAN + 1 MEETING WITH INDIA ON THE MARGINS OF THE UPCOMING </p><p>MEETING IN CAMBODIA THIS NOVEMBER.  A SEPARATE, FIRST-EVER </p><p>"+ 1" MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO OCCUR EARLY NEXT YEAR WITH </p><p>AUSTRALIA.  IN ADDITION TO THESE MEETINGS, ASEAN ALSO WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO DEVELOP A "+ 1" RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>CHI SUGGESTED THAT SUCH A MEETING COULD BE ATTEMPTED AS </p><p>EARLY AS THIS YEAR. VIETNAM BELIEVES THAT A ONE-DAY SUMMIT </p><p>ON THE MARGINS OF THE MEXICO APEC SUMMIT WOULD OFFER A GOOD </p><p>TEST FOR THIS IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>PAST AND FUTURE LEADERSHIP </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  CHI SAID BRUNEI HAD DONE A "GOOD JOB" OF HOSTING THE </p><p>CONFERENCE. CHI OPINED THAT CAMBODIA "SHOULD BE READY" TO </p><p>HOST THE NOVEMBER MEETING.  HE NOTED THAT THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS SENT DELEGATES TO HANOI AND BANDAR SERI </p><p>BEGAWAN FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS IN AN EFFORT TO LEARN THEIR </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES AS HOSTS.  CHI SAID THAT THIS PREPARATION </p><p>SHOULD PROVIDE FOR A SMOOTH TRANSITION.  PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
