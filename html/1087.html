(C) SUMMARY: DESPITE A STATE-SPONSORED CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE, AND THE RULING PARTY\'S </p><p>CONTROL OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) STILL IS LIKELY TO WIN AT LEAST </p><p>20 PERCENT OF THE 150 PARLIAMENTARY SEAT TOTAL (OR 30 </p><p>SEATS) IN THE ELECTIONS NOW SCHEDULED FOR JUNE 24-25. </p><p>(NOTE: ONLY 120 OF THE 150 SEATS ARE ELECTED. THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02734  01 OF 05  230816Z </p><p>REMAINING 30 ARE APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT.

SUPPORT FOR THE MDC REMAINS STRONG IN MOST </p><p>URBAN CENTERS; HENCE OUR PREDICTION THAT THE OPPOSITION </p><p>MOVEMENT WILL MANAGE TO CAPTURE AT LEAST 30 SEATS (REF </p><p>A). HOWEVER, MDC LEADERS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SURPRISE </p><p>AT THE LEVEL OF SUSTAINED STATE SPONSORED VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE -- AND </p><p>INCREASINGLY IN THE CITIES -- AND THE REFUSAL OF THE </p><p>POLICE TO INTERVENE. MEANWHILE, THE RULING PARTY ZANU-PF </p><p>IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ITS CONTROL OF THE ELECTORAL </p><p>PROCESS BY DELAYING THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>CONSTITUENCY BOUNDARIES. THE MDC ARGUES THAT IT CANNOT </p><p>FORMALLY NOMINATE CANDIDATES FOR EACH CONSTITUENCY UNTIL </p><p>IT KNOWS WHAT THOSE CONSTITUENCIES ARE, AND THAT THE GOZ </p><p>IS PURPOSELY DELAYING THE RELEASE OF THIS INFORMATION. </p><p>NONETHELESS, MDC LEADERS STATE THE PARTY ENJOYS </p><p>WIDESPREAD AND SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT IN BOTH URBAN AND </p><p>RURAL AREAS, AND THAT THE RULING PARTY\'S INTIMIDATION </p><p>TACTICS WILL BACKFIRE COME ELECTION DAY. WHILE POST </p><p>EXPECTS THE MDC TO CERTAINLY GET A FOOT IN THE DOOR OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT, AT THIS TIME WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE NEARLY </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PARTY TO SECURE A PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>MAJORITY OF 76 SEATS.

ACCORDING TO A RUNNING DATABASE BEING COMPILED </p><p>BY A MIXTURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS, CHURCHES, </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTIES, AND THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION, </p><p>OVER 5,000 ASSAULTS AND INJURIES, AND AT LEAST 21 </p><p>MURDERS, HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE FARM </p><p>INVASIONS IN FEBRUARY. ALMOST ALL OF THE VIOLENT ACTS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESSES, WERE CARRIED OUT BY ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS. FOR THE MOST PART, THE POLICE, UNDER ORDERS </p><p>FROM THE POWERS-THAT-BE, HAVE STOOD IDLY BY -- AND IN </p><p>SOME CASES EVEN ASSISTED THE ATTACKERS -- AS THESE </p><p>CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED. THE BULK OF THE RULING </p><p>PARTY\'S CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN FOCUSED IN THE RURAL AREAS </p><p>WHERE TWO-THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY\'S POPULATION RESIDE. ON </p><p>INVADED COMMERCIAL FARMS (WHICH NOW TOTAL OVER 1,000), </p><p>WAR VETERANS AND GROUPS OF ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS (MAINLY </p><p>UNEMPLOYED YOUTH) CONTINUE TO TERRORIZE FARMERS AND </p><p>THEIR EMPLOYEES, FORCING THEM TO ATTEND "RE-EDUCATION" </p><p>RALLIES AND SEVERELY BEATING (IN SOME CASES MURDERING) </p><p>SUSPECTED MDC SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.

ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS HAVE BURNED THE </p><p>HOMES AND DESTROYED PROPERTY OF NUMEROUS MDC OFFICIALS </p><p>IN HARARE, GWERU, AND KWEKWE, AND VIOLENT SKIRMISHES </p><p>BETWEEN MDC AND ZANU-PF MEMBERS OCCUR REGULARLY AROUND </p><p>THE COUNTRY. WAR VETERANS AND OTHER ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS, </p><p>EMBOLDENED BY THE TACIT SUPPORT OF POLICE, HAVE BEGUN TO </p><p>TARGET FACTORIES AND OTHER BUSINESSES, MOST OF WHICH ARE </p><p>OWNED BY WHITES OR MEMBERS OF THE INDIAN COMMUNITY WITH </p><p>SUSPECTED MDC LOYALTIES. DURING THE WEEK OF MAY 15, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, TWO FACTORIES IN BULAWAYO AND ONE LUMBER MILL </p><p>IN CHIPINGE WERE STORMED BY GROUPS OF ZANU-PF THUGS </p><p>DEMANDING MONEY FOR THEIR CAMPAIGN, AS WELL AS </p><p>MANAGEMENT\'S\' OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE RULING PARTY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02734  02 OF 05  230817Z </p><p>ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESSES, SEVERAL EMPLOYEES WERE BEATEN </p><p>AND THE MANAGEMENT STAFF "ROUGHED UP" AS POLICE STOOD BY </p><p>IN PLAIN VIEW AND DID NOTHING.

(C) IN ADDITION TO ITS CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION, THE </p><p>RULING PARTY ALSO IS USING ITS CONTROL OF THE ELECTORAL </p><p>PROCESS TO STACK THE DECK IN ITS FAVOR. SUPREME COURT </p><p>JUSTICE WILSON SANDURA HAS STATED PUBLICLY THAT, AS OF </p><p>MAY 19, THE DELIMITATION COMMISSION WHICH HE CHAIRS HAD </p><p>NOT RELEASED ITS OFFICIAL WRITTEN REPORT. HOWEVER, </p><p>JUSTICE SANDURA TOLD REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE (NDI) PRE-ELECTION SURVEY TEAM </p><p>DURING THE WEEK OF MAY 15 THAT WHILE HE HAS DISCUSSED </p><p>THE BOUNDARIES OF THE NEW CONSTITUENCIES VERBALLY WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE, HE HAS NOT PROVIDED HIM WITH ANY </p><p>WRITTEN REPORT.

(NOTE: ONE OF THE </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES THAT HAS BEEN ELIMINATED, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE MINISTER, IS BULAWAYO SOUTH, WHERE ATTORNEY DAVID </p><p>COLTART, THE MDC\'S SECRETARY FOR LEGAL AFFAIRS, WAS </p><p>FAVORED TO WIN.

DAVID COLTART AND TENDAI BITI, THE MDC\'S </p><p>SECRETARY FOR LANDS AND AGRICULTURE, ANNOUNCED TO THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PRESS ON MAY 18 THAT THE MDC INTENDS TO SUE PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE FOR FAILING TO ANNOUNCE THE NEW CONSTITUENCIES IN </p><p>SUFFICIENT TIME TO ALLOW CANDIDATES TO SUBMIT THEIR </p><p>NOMINATIONS, AS WELL AS OTHER GOVERNMENT TACTICS THAT </p><p>THE MDC ARGUES IS PRECLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF FREE AND </p><p>FAIR ELECTIONS ON JUNE 24-25. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: WHEN THE DELIMITATION COMMISSION\'S </p><p>OFFICIAL REPORT IS RELEASED, WE EXPECT TO SEE THE </p><p>BOUNDARIES REDRAWN TO SPLIT UP THOSE CONSTITUENCIES, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02734  03 OF 05  230817Z </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AREAS, THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE PRO- </p><p>MDC. IN SOME CASES, LIKE BULAWAYO SOUTH, THE </p><p>CONSTITUENCY WILL BE ELIMINATED ALTOGETHER. THE RULING </p><p>PARTY LIKELY WILL WAIT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE TO RELEASE </p><p>THE REPORT, GIVING THE MDC VERY LITTLE TIME TO SUBMIT </p><p>ITS CANDIDATES\' NOMINATIONS. THE RULING PARTY\'S </p><p>TAMPERING WITH THE CONSTITUENT BOUNDARIES -- AND ALMOST </p><p>CERTAINLY WITH THE VOTERS\' ROLL -- IS CLEARLY AN ATTEMPT </p><p>TO DISADVANTAGE THE MDC AT THE POLLS IN JUNE. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>MDC STILL CONFIDENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, PRESIDENT OF THE MDC, TOLD </p><p>REPORTERS ON MAY 10 THAT HIS PARTY WAS CONSIDERING </p><p>BOYCOTTING THE ELECTIONS BECAUSE, IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE </p><p>OF INTIMIDATION, A FREE AND FAIR VOTE WOULD NOT BE </p><p>POSSIBLE. THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA SEIZED THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO PORTRAY THE MDC AS TURNING TAIL AND </p><p>RUNNING WHEN THE GOING GOT TOUGH. DAVID COLTART </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT TSVANGIRAI\'S STATEMENT WAS NOT ONE OF </p><p>COWARDICE, BUT RATHER AN OFFER TO MDC CANDIDATES OF A </p><p>WAY OUT OF THE VIOLENCE, IF THEY CHOSE TO TAKE IT. </p><p>ACCORDING TO COLTART AND WELSHMAN NCUBE, THE MDC\'S </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL, THE PARTY\'S SENIOR LEADERSHIP IS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELFARE OF ITS CANDIDATES AND </p><p>SUPPORTERS IN THE FIELD WHO ARE BEING, OR HAVE BEEN, </p><p>TARGETS OF VIOLENCE.

THE MDC\'S ELECTION </p><p>CAMPAIGN THEREFORE CONTINUES. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) WELSHMAN NCUBE CONFIRMED THAT THE PARTY STILL </p><p>INTENDS TO FIELD CANDIDATES IN EVERY DISTRICT EXCEPT </p><p>THAT OF INDEPENDENT PARLIAMENTARIAN MARGARET DONGO. </p><p>ALTHOUGH FUNDING CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM, NCUBE STATED </p><p>THAT SMALL, INDIVIDUAL, AND OFTEN ANONYMOUS DONATIONS </p><p>CONTINUE TO ARRIVE REGULARLY, AND THAT ALL OF THESE </p><p>"DROPS IN THE BUCKET" ARE ADDING UP.

(C) BEYOND FUNDING SHORTFALLS, THE WAVE OF STATE- </p><p>SPONSORED VIOLENCE ACROSS ZIMBABWE HAS FORCED THE MDC\'S </p><p>CAMPAIGN LARGELY UNDERGROUND AT THIS POINT. NCUBE TOLD </p><p>EMBOFFS THAT THE PARTY WAS "SURPRISED" BY, AND </p><p>"UNPREPARED" FOR, THE LEVEL OF INTIMIDATION THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02734  04 OF 05  230818Z </p><p>RULING PARTY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUSTAIN. IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>SAID NCUBE, MDC LEADERS DID NOT EXPECT THE POLICE TO </p><p>TOTALLY ABDICATE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND ALLOW VICIOUS </p><p>BEATINGS AND KILLINGS TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. </p><p>AS A RESULT, THE MDC NOW IS HOLDING ALMOST NO RALLIES ON </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS, EITHER BECAUSE THE AREAS HAVE BEEN </p><p>INVADED BY WAR VETERANS AND THEIR FOLLOWERS, AND/OR </p><p>BECAUSE THE FARMERS, FEARFUL OF RETALIATION PERPETRATED </p><p>BY THE RULING PARTY TOUGHS, REFUSE TO ALLOW THE EVENTS </p><p>TO TAKE PLACE ON THEIR PROPERTIES. MOREOVER, SAID NCUBE, </p><p>THE MDC RECOGNIZES THAT AGENTS FROM THE CENTRAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO) ARE PRESENT AT MOST OF </p><p>THEIR GATHERINGS, AND THAT ANY FARM WORKER THAT ATTENDS </p><p>ONE OF THEIR RALLIES IS LIKELY TO BE "VISITED LATER IN </p><p>THE NIGHT." IN THE CITIES AND PERI-URBAN AREAS WHERE THE </p><p>MDC ENJOYS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT, SAID NCUBE, THE PARTY IS </p><p>STILL ABLE TO HOLD SMALL RALLIES AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO </p><p>SO. THE MAJORITY OF THE MDC\'S CAMPAIGNING NOW IS BEING </p><p>DONE BY WORD OF MOUTH, THOUGH, IN SMALL GROUPS AT </p><p>PEOPLE\'S HOMES AND OTHER PRIVATE LOCATIONS. PARTY </p><p>LEADERS HAVE ADVISED THEIR MEMBERS -- PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>THE TROUBLED AREAS OF THE MASHONALAND PROVINCES -- TO </p><p>PUT THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY FIRST AND AVOID WEARING MDC T- </p><p>SHIRTS OR CHANTING MDC SLOGANS IN PUBLIC. THE LEADERS </p><p>THEMSELVES ALSO ARE TAKING EXTRA SECURITY PRECAUTIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING SENDING THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS TO STAY </p><p>WITH FRIENDS OR DISTANT RELATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) DESPITE THE RULING PARTY\'S ATTEMPTS TO "RE- </p><p>EDUCATE" ITS WAYWARD CITIZENS, THE MDC STILL IS </p><p>CONFIDENT OF WINNING A MAJORITY OF 76 SEATS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02734  04 OF 05  230818Z </p><p>PARLIAMENT. MDC MEMBERS ASSERT THAT ZANU-PF WILL </p><p>DISCOVER ON ELECTION DAY THAT ITS INTIMIDATION TACTICS </p><p>HAVE BACKFIRED. NCUBE PREDICTS WITH GREAT CONFIDENCE </p><p>THAT, "PEOPLE WILL VOTE THEIR CONSCIENCE" AT THE POLLS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) THE RULING PARTY\'S SCARE TACTICS AND "RE- </p><p>EDUCATION" CAMPAIGN, BOTH ON THE FARMS AND IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT-OWNED MEDIA, UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE HAD SOME EFFECT </p><p>ON VOTERS. IN THE RURAL AREAS, FARM WORKERS AND COMMUNAL </p><p>RESIDENTS -- TWO-THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY\'S POPULATION -- </p><p>GENERALLY ARE UNSOPHISTICATED; LACK ACCESS TO ANY MEDIA </p><p>EXCEPT THAT CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT; AND, ACCORDING </p><p>TO SOME COMMERCIAL FARMERS, ARE EASILY INTIMIDATED BY </p><p>THE RULING PARTY. HIGH PRICES, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND </p><p>DECLINING DISPOSABLE INCOME HAVE TAUGHT RURAL RESIDENTS, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT ALL IS NOT WELL WITH ZANU-PF\'S MANAGEMENT </p><p>OF THE ECONOMY. MEANWHILE, MANY OF THEIR CHILDREN AND </p><p>OTHER RELATIVES LIVE IN THE CITY AND RETURN HOME ON </p><p>WEEKENDS WITH TALES OF THEIR FINANCIAL STRAITS -- A </p><p>STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT THE MDC IS PROMISING TO REVERSE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5620 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02734  05 OF 05  230818Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-01 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  ANHR-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------5A207E  230818Z /38 </p><p>R 230817Z MAY 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6112 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>AMCONSUL CAPE TOWN </p><p>AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LILONGWE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 05 OF 05 HARARE 002734 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02734  05 OF 05  230818Z </p><p>DEPT FOR DRL/ROBERT WARD </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/ROBERT SHEPARD </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/RALYEA AND NATAN EPSTEIN </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USAID WASHDC FOR AFR/SA - NAN NEWMAN, OTI - </p><p>MARC SCOTT, AND A/AID - RICHARD MCCALL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/23/2000 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC STILL LIKELY TO WIN AT LEAST 20 PERCENT OF </p><p>TOTAL PARLIAMENTARY SEATS </p><p> </p><p>IT IS THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO JUDGE HOW RURAL RESIDENTS </p><p>WILL VOTE IN JUNE, PARTICULARLY NOW THAT THE RULING </p><p>PARTY HAS EFFECTIVELY QUELLED THEIR ABILITY TO FREELY </p><p>EXPRESS THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS.
