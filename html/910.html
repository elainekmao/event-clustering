<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CAIRO 012034 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 11/13/02 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KISL, MEPP, PTER, KPAL, IS, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: LEADING ISLAMIC FIGURE DENOUNCES TERRORISM </p><p>AGAINST ISRAELIS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  CAIRO 11403 </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON MINISTER COUNSELOR JEFF </p><p>MILLINGTON FOR REASON 1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR MUHAMMAD TANTAWI, </p><p>IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 7 IN A POPULAR </p><p>EGYPTIAN MAGAZINE, STATED HIS OPPOSITION ON ISLAMIC </p><p>GROUNDS TO SUICIDE OPERATIONS AGAINST ISRAELI </p><p>CIVILIANS.  LIKE HIS RECENT MEETING WITH THE ISRAELI </p><p>AMBASSADOR, HIS FORTHRIGHT REFUTATION OF POLITICALLY </p><p>POPULAR "RESISTANCE" OPERATIONS DEMONSTRATES TANTAWI\'S </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO EXHORT MUSLIMS TO FOLLOW ISLAMIC </p><p>TEACHINGS UNTAINTED BY POLITICAL IDEOLOGY.  TANTAWI </p><p>HAS GOVERNMENT SANCTION, BUT NOT THE FULL BACKING OF </p><p>THE OFFICIAL RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT HERE, FOR HIS </p><p>OUTSPOKEN POSITIONS ON TOLERANCE TOWARDS ISRAEL AND </p><p>JEWS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) SHEIKH TANTAWI WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT-OWNED AL-MUSAWWAR.  AL-MUSAWWAR IS A POPULAR </p><p>WEEKLY NEWS MAGAZINE.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW: </p><p> </p><p>INTERVIEWER:  ALL PREVIOUS SHEIKHS OF AL-AZHAR REFUSED </p><p>TO MEET WITH ANY ISRAELI, AND THE LATE SHEIKH </p><p>GAD EL-HAQ EVEN REFUSED TO MEET ISRAELI PRESIDENT </p><p>EZER WEIZMAN. </p><p> </p><p>SHEIK TANTAWI:  I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OTHERS\' </p><p>OPINIONS.  I PERSONALLY MEET WITH WHOMEVER I WANT AND I </p><p>AM NOT ASKED WHY I MET WITH A CERTAIN PERSON.... </p><p> </p><p>INTERVIEWER:  IN A PREVIOUS INTERVIEW WITH ME YOU </p><p>COMMENTED ON THE LEBANESE RESISTANCE, REPRESENTED BY </p><p>HIZBOLLAH, AND ON THEIR SUICIDE OPERATIONS.  YOU SAID </p><p>THAT THESE DEATHS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ACTS OF </p><p>MARTYRDOM. </p><p> </p><p>SHEIKH TANTAWI:  I CAN\'T CHANGE WHAT I BELIEVE IN. </p><p>I SAY THAT ANYONE WHO BLOWS HIMSELF UP AMONG AN ENEMY </p><p>WHO IS AGGRESSING UPON HIS PROPERTY, LAND, HONOR OR </p><p>COUNTRY IS A MARTYR.  THE DEFENSE OF RELIGION AND </p><p>COUNTRY IS A JIHAD (HOLY STRUGGLE).  BUT BLOWING UP </p><p>ONESELF AMONG CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND OLD, SICK AND </p><p>INNOCENT PEOPLE - THIS IS AN ACT THAT IS VERY MUCH </p><p>AGAINST ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>INTERVIEWER:  BUT SOME MAY SAY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO </p><p>DEFINE WHO IS AN INNOCENT ISRAELI AND THAT ALL OF THEM </p><p>ARE MILITARY COLONIAL INVADERS. </p><p> </p><p>SHEIKH TANTAWI:  I CANNOT GO DOWN THAT PATH OR SAY SUCH </p><p>A THING.  PEOPLE MAY SAY WHAT THEY WANT.  MY DEFINITION </p><p>(OF THE ENEMY) CONFORMS TO WHAT THE KORAN COMMANDS US, </p><p>NAMELY TO REPEL AGGRESSION.  ALMIGHTY GOD SAYS:  "FIGHT </p><p>IN THE CAUSE OF GOD THOSE WHO FIGHT YOU, BUT DO NOT </p><p>TRANSGRESS LIMITS, FOR GOD LOVES NOT TRANSGRESSORS." </p><p>OUR PROPHET IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS.  THE PROPHET FOUGHT </p><p>HIS ENEMIES, INCLUDING ARAB RENEGADES, HYPOCRITES, AND </p><p>JEWS, BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN PROVEN THAT THE PROPHET </p><p>KILLED A WOMAN OR CHILD.  WHAT IS PROVEN IS THAT THE </p><p>PROPHET ABHORRED THE PRESENCE OF A WOMAN AMONG AN </p><p>ENEMY\'S DEAD AND SAID "SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN </p><p>KILLED." </p><p> </p><p>INTERVIEWER:  THE PROPHET ADVISED MUSLIMS TO SEEK THE </p><p>COUNSEL OF CHRISTIANS ONLY, AND NOT THE JEWS, SINCE THE </p><p>LATTER WERE KNOWN FOR TREACHERY, BREAKING PROMISES AND </p><p>DISLOYALTY TO ANY FORM OF COMMITMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SHEIKH TANTAWI: I FOLLOW GOD\'S HOLY BOOK.  THE KORAN </p><p>SPEAKS OF AND EMPHASIZES THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK, AND </p><p>STATES "DO NOT DISPUTE WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK </p><p>...BUT SAY WE BELIEVE IN THE REVELATION WHICH HAS COME </p><p>DOWN TO US AND IN THAT WHICH HAS COME DOWN TO YOU. OUR </p><p>GOD AND YOUR GOD IS ONE, AND IT IS TO HIM THAT WE BOW </p><p>IN ISLAM."  SO IF THE KORAN SAYS SO, CAN I SAY THAT </p><p>WHAT IS MEANT BY "PEOPLE OF THE BOOK" ARE THE </p><p>CHRISTIANS WITHOUT THE JEWS?  INDEED THE "PEOPLE OF THE </p><p>BOOK" ARE THE JEWS AND THE CHRISTIANS BOTH, AND IT IS </p><p>NOT POSSIBLE TO RESTRICT "PEOPLE OF THE BOOK" TO EITHER </p><p>THE CHRISTIANS OR THE JEWS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SHEIKH TANTAWI\'S MESSAGE OF TOLERANCE TOWARDS </p><p>JEWS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S THEME OF </p><p>INTERFAITH TOLERANCE, HIGHLIGHTED IN PRESIDENT </p><p>MUBARAK\'S SPEECH LAST JULY ON THE OCCASION OF PROPHET </p><p>MUHAMMAD\'S BIRTHDAY.  SHEIKH TANTAWI\'S MEETING WITH THE </p><p>ISRAELI AMBASSADOR HAD OFFICIAL SANCTION - HE MENTIONS </p><p>ELSEWHERE IN THE INTERVIEW THAT HE SPOKE WITH FM MOUSSA </p><p>BEFORE AGREEING TO MEET WITH THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR. </p><p>MOUSSA TOLD HIM THE DECISION WAS UP TO HIM, HE SAID. </p><p>THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS ENCOURAGED BY SHEIKH </p><p>TANTAWI AND, ACCORDING TO THE ISRAELI EMBASSY HERE </p><p>(PROTECT), THE GOI IS SEEKING A SUITABLE CHRISTIAN </p><p>RELIGIOUS LEADER TO HOST AN INTERFAITH MEETING THAT </p><p>WOULD INCLUDE TANTAWI AND THE CHIEF SEPHARDIC RABBI OF </p><p>ISRAEL.  THEY ARE HOPING POPE JOHN PAUL II WILL AGREE </p><p>TO HOST THIS MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) TANTAWI IS USING THE PRESTIGE OF HIS AL-AZHAR </p><p>POST TO PREACH IN THE EGYPTIAN MEDIA AGAINST THE </p><p>RADICALIZED POLITICAL ISLAM PROPOUNDED BY THE MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD AND BY ISLAMIC TERRORIST GROUPS.  THEIR </p><p>VERSIONS OF ISLAM, AND POSITIONS ON ISSUES OF THE DAY, </p><p>CONTINUE TO HAVE MUCH RESONANCE HERE.  TANTAWI\'S </p><p>POSITIONS ON TOLERANCE TOWARDS JEWS AND ENGAGING IN </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH ISRAELIS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT BUT NOT DICTATED BY IT.   HE REMAINS AT ODDS </p><p>WITH HIS OWN RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT OVER HIS MEETING </p><p>WITH THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR.  TANTAWI FACES AN UPHILL </p><p>BATTLE, BOTH IN AND OUTSIDE OF OFFICIAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>CIRCLES, BUT HE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF RETREAT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BATTLE </p><p></p></div>
