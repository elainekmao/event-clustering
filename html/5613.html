(C) THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEES </p><p>OF THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT WILL HOLD A JOINT HEARING ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 12 TO DISCUSS CROATIA\'S POLICY TOWARD POTENTIAL </p><p>MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ.  SOME OF CROATIA\'S LEADING </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS OBJECTED TO NOT BEING CONSULTED IN ADVANCE </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT TAKING A STRONG PUBLIC STANCE WITH OTHER </p><p>VILNIUS-10 STATES IN SUPPORT OF THE U.S. APPROACH ON IRAQ. </p><p>IN A MEETING WITH THE CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>COMMITTEE ON FEBRUARY 7, WE WARNED THAT THIS ISSUE MUST NOT </p><p>BE USED TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS; PRESIDENT MESIC\'S ADDRESS </p><p>AND THE V-10 STATEMENT SENT A STRONG POSITIVE MESSAGE; THE </p><p>SABOR SHOULD NOT SEEK TO DILUTE THIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MOST OF CROATIA\'S LEADING POLITICIANS, INCLUDING </p><p>PRESIDENT MESIC, LEARNED OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION TO JOIN </p><p>V-10 COUNTRIES ON FEBRUARY 5 IN A STRONG DECLARATION OF </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. POSITION ON IRAQ (REF A) FROM PRESS </p><p>REPORTING.  SOME OF CROATIA\'S POLITICIANS ARE OBJECTING TO </p><p>THE STATEMENT, WHICH THEY CLAIM WAS TAKEN WITHOUT APPROPRIATE </p><p>CONSULTATION.  AS HE OFTEN DOES, PRESIDENT MESIC TOOK THE </p><p>HIGH ROAD, AND GAVE A TELEVISED ADDRESS ON FEBRUARY 6 (REF B) </p><p>URGING PEACEFUL RESOLUTION THROUGH SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION, </p><p>BUT STATED THAT "IF A WAR FOR WHAT IS RIGHT IS INEVITABLE, </p><p>THEN CROATIA KNOWS WHERE HER PLACE IS."  OTHER POLITICIANS </p><p>HAVE BEEN LESS SUPPORTIVE, BUT MOST OBJECT MORE TO BEING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00297  01 OF 02  071534Z </p><p>EXCLUDED FROM THE POLICY DECISION RATHER THAN TO THE MERITS </p><p>OF SUPPORTING THE U.S. POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) JOZO RADOS AND IVO BANAC, PRESIDENTS OF TWO OF THE </p><p>RULING COALITION\'S THREE "JUNIOR PARTNER" PARTIES, ISSUED </p><p>STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE GOC POSITION ON IRAQ.  IVO </p><p>SANADER, PRESIDENT OF CROATIA\'S OPPOSITION HDZ, MADE A </p><p>STATEMENT ON FEBRUARY 6 THAT HIS PARTY "GIVES ITS FULL </p><p>SUPPORT TO PRESIDENT BUSH AND THE POLICY OF THE UNITED </p><p>STATES."  (NOTE: THE HDZ DESPERATELY SEEKS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>VALIDATION FOR ITS INCOMPLETE INTERNAL REFORM PROCESS SO IT </p><p>CAN CONVINCE CROATIAN VOTERS IT IS NO LONGER THE CORRUPT, </p><p>EXTREMIST PARTY OF FORMER PRESIDENT TUDJMAN.)  OPPOSITION </p><p>HSLS PRESIDENT DRAZEN BUDISA SAID THAT HIS PARTY (WHICH WAS </p><p>EJECTED FROM THE CURRENT COALITION IN JULY 2002) "FOUND THE </p><p>STAND OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE SO-CALLED OLD EUROPE MORE </p><p>REASONABLE AND ACCEPTABLE THAN THAT OF THE VILNIUS GROUP." </p><p> </p><p>LAYING DOWN A MARKER: NO POLITICS ON IRAQ </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 7, WE MET WITH ANTE MARKOV (HSS, THE </p><p>SECOND-LARGEST PARTY IN THE RULING COALITION), CHAIR OF THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT\'S NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE.  A DAY EARLIER, </p><p>MARKOV WAS QUOTED IN THE PRESS AS REFUSING TO COMMENT ON THE </p><p>V-10 STATEMENT BECAUSE HE IS NOT CERTAIN "IF THE POSITION </p><p>EXPRESSED IS THE POSITION OF ALL CROATIA."  WE TOLD HIM </p><p>BLUNTLY THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE ON WHICH TO PLAY POLITICS. </p><p>MARKOV WAS QUICK TO EXPLAIN THAT HE AND ZDRAVKO TOMAC (SDP), </p><p>CHAIR OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, TRIED WITHOUT SUCCESS </p><p>TO REACH FM PICULA BEFORE THE STATEMENT WAS RELEASED IN ORDER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00297  01 OF 02  071534Z </p><p>TO DEVELOP A UNIFIED POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MARKOV SAID THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE </p><p>POSITION EXPRESSED BY THE PRESIDENT IN HIS ADDRESS AND THE </p><p>POSITION PUT FORWARD IN THE V-10 STATEMENT.  CROATIA SHOULD </p><p>HAVE A UNIFIED POSITION.  THEREFORE, THE SABOR\'S NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY COMMITTEE AND THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HAVE </p><p>AGREED TO HOLD A JOINT HEARING ON FEBRUARY 12 TO DEVELOP A </p><p>UNIFIED POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WE TOLD MARKOV THAT WHILE WE WOULD WELCOME AN EVEN </p><p>BROADER CONSENSUS OF CROATIAN SUPPORT FOR OUR VIEW OF THE </p><p>DANGERS PRESENTED BY IRAQ, WE CAUTIONED AGAINST DILUTING THE </p><p>POWERFUL, POSITIVE MESSAGE THAT CROATIA HAS PUT INTO PLAY. </p><p>WE CAUTIONED MARKOV THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS MUST NOT VIEW THEIR </p><p>DECISION ON IRAQ AS CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE EU; </p><p>WHILE THERE IS AS YET NO CONSENSUS WITHIN THE EU, SOME </p><p>LEADING MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY MADE THEIR DECISION.  MARKOV </p><p>WELCOMED OUR OFFER TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE MEETING WITH </p><p>INFORMATION BASED ON SECRETARY POWELL\'S INTERVENTION AT THE </p><p>UNSC. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5531 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00297  02 OF 02  071534Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    CIAE-00  INL-00   DS-00    FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   VCE-00   NEA-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /002W </p><p>                  ------------------32B640  071534Z /38 </p><p>O 071511Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9411 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DIA WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000297 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, HR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA: SABOR TO DEBATE POSITION ON IRAQ; </p><p>POLITICS AS USUAL? </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00297  02 OF 02  071534Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
