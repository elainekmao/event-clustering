<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000670 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W AND AF/PD </p><p>LAGOS FOR PAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KDEM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  EMBASSY\'S ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NIGERIAN MEDIA </p><p>ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL:  STATE 81949 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Ambassador Jeter and Mission PAS staff </p><p>have worked assiduously to ensure broad coverage </p><p>within the Nigerian media of USG policy positions on </p><p>Iraq.  Our media strategy has included placement of an </p><p>op-ed that addressed many Nigerian misperceptions </p><p>regarding U.S. military intervention in Iraq, one-on- </p><p>one television and print interviews, and press </p><p>roundtables both in Lagos and Abuja.  Much of the </p><p>press attention has focused on the erroneous </p><p>statements by GON officials linking the Nigerian </p><p>Government\'s position on Iraq to the recent suspension </p><p>of FY-03 USG military assistance to Nigeria. </p><p>Clarification on this matter, through press releases </p><p>and the Ambassador\'s statements, has dramatically </p><p>lessened media attention to this non-issue.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador\'s Op-Ed </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  To date, eight papers have printed Ambassador </p><p>Jeter\'s op-ed stating the U.S. case for military </p><p>intervention in Iraq.  The op-ed emphasized that the </p><p>U.S. is not at war against Islam or for control of </p><p>Iraqi oil, two misperceptions receiving steady media </p><p>play in Nigeria.  The op-ed stressed that Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s regime had used weapons of mass destruction </p><p>in the past against his own people and neighbors, had </p><p>failed to account for them through the UN inspection </p><p>process, and had links to terrorists, making Iraq a </p><p>potential menace both to the U.S. and the world.  As </p><p>reported in the Mission\'s April 4 daily task force </p><p>report, Iraqi diplomat Firah Saleh responded to the </p><p>op-ed by claiming that Americans could not teach Iraq </p><p>about democracy.  Rather than defending the Iraqi </p><p>regime, most of Saleh\'s rebuttal was a critique of </p><p>U.S. support for Israel and Israeli policy towards the </p><p>Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Abuja Press Event on March 25 </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  On March 25, Ambassador Jeter met Abuja-based </p><p>editors and journalists on the Iraqi conflict </p><p>following a telepress conference with African Affairs </p><p>Bureau Assistant Secretary Kansteiner.  The primary </p><p>issue raised by reporters was the withdrawal of </p><p>military assistance to Nigeria and its relationship to </p><p>the GON position on Iraq.  The Ambassador explained </p><p>the two issues were not linked.  He told the </p><p>journalists that he reiterated to the Minister of </p><p>State for Foreign Affairs that these issues were </p><p>absolutely and categorically not connected.  The Voice </p><p>of Germany\'s Hausa Service reporter asked if the U.S. </p><p>entered Iraq to control its oil so that the U.S. could </p><p>flood the world market and force down oil prices.  The </p><p>Ambassador said the war with Iraq was not about oil; </p><p>nor was it a war against a people, religion or </p><p>country; rather, it was a war against a very, very bad </p><p>regime.  He added that in the past twelve years, Iraq </p><p>had flouted numerous UN resolutions by refusing to </p><p>disarm, noting that the U.S. and its allies believe </p><p>the present Iraqi regime is a danger to international </p><p>peace and a threat to U.S. national security.  The </p><p>Ambassador said there is sufficient evidence that the </p><p>regime has WMD and its leadership is linked to </p><p>terrorist organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Ishaq Modibbo Kawo, the editor of the northern </p><p>independent "Daily Trust" newspaper, asked why the </p><p>U.S. has not registered similar concerns about </p><p>Israel\'s refusal to comply with UN resolutions.  The </p><p>Ambassador responded that the U.S. is working very </p><p>hard with countries in the Middle East as well as </p><p>through the Quartet to bring peace and a just </p><p>settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli issue.  He said </p><p>President Bush is fully committed to a just settlement </p><p>in the Middle East, including a viable, independent </p><p>Palestinian state.  The News Agency of Nigeria </p><p>reporter wanted to know if the U.S. government had </p><p>asked Nigeria to expel Iraqi diplomats from Nigeria. </p><p>The Ambassador said if such a discussion had taken </p><p>place, it was between the two governments and he would </p><p>not comment on bilateral diplomatic discussions with </p><p>the media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Sunday Show on March 30 </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  On March 30, Ambassador Jeter appeared on the </p><p>Sunday Show, a popular Lagos-based Sunday afternoon </p><p>talk show whose broadcast audience is confined to </p><p>southwestern Nigeria.  In a wide-ranging conversation, </p><p>the Ambassador focused on the broad bilateral </p><p>relationship with Nigeria, USG assistance efforts, and </p><p>the importance of the upcoming elections.  He </p><p>explained the misperception over linkage between the </p><p>suspension of military assistance and Nigeria\'s </p><p>position on the Iraq war.  Phone-in callers raised </p><p>visa questions, concerns over travel to the U.S. while </p><p>the war with Iraq is underway, and a request to help </p><p>the Nigerian population attain the same level of </p><p>national patriotism as seen in the United States.  One </p><p>caller provided unqualified support for President Bush </p><p>and military intervention in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>March 31 Meeting with the Nigerian Editors Guild </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Chaired by Nigerian Guild of Editors President </p><p>Remi Oyo, 17 senior print and broadcast editors held a </p><p>roundtable discussion with the Ambassador on March 31. </p><p>The journalists engaged the Ambassador for two and a </p><p>half hours on the war in Iraq, US-Nigerian relations </p><p>and the upcoming Nigerian elections.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>gave detailed responses to all queries, even as </p><p>questions invariably returned to Iraq and the alleged </p><p>linked suspension of certain military assistance to </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  On questions relating to the widely reported </p><p>linkage of U.S. military aid and Nigeria\'s antiwar </p><p>stance regarding Iraq, Ambassador Jeter explained that </p><p>the suspension was based on allegations of human </p><p>rights abuses by soldiers in Benue State in 2001.  He </p><p>said any suggested linkage between the military </p><p>assistance and Iraqi issues was false.  Regarding </p><p>bilateral relations, Ambassador Jeter said Nigeria and </p><p>the U.S. have enjoyed excellent relations since the </p><p>coming of the civilian government in 1999.  He backed </p><p>up his point with the example of President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>visits to the U.S.:  Obasanjo was the first African </p><p>leader invited by President Bush for an official visit </p><p>to Washington and he was also the first African leader </p><p>invited to the U.S. after 9/11.  These visits </p><p>symbolized a special relationship, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Answering questions on the justification of the </p><p>U.S. strike in Iraq, Ambassador Jeter said Saddam </p><p>Hussein had violated 16 U.N. resolutions over the past </p><p>12 years.  He said all attempts, including sanctions, </p><p>diplomacy and limited military actions, had failed to </p><p>get Hussein to abide by the will of the international </p><p>community.   The Ambassador added that the coalition </p><p>forces are trying to be selective in their strikes to </p><p>avoid civilian casualties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Specifically on Nigeria, Jeter posited that the </p><p>country has made some significant progress since the </p><p>coming of civilian rule in 1999, adding that Nigerians </p><p>need to be more patient.  He noted that the coming </p><p>election will be a crucial and critical test for </p><p>Nigeria and that the country cannot afford to fail. </p><p>Failure would have dire consequences for Nigeria, West </p><p>Africa, and the entire African continent, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TELL Magazine Juxtaposes Interviews with Jeter and </p><p>Iraqi Ambassador </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>10.  Weekly news magazine TELL, in its March 31 - </p><p>April 7 edition, published separate interviews with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter and Iraqi Ambassador to Nigeria Sabah </p><p>Omran.  Omran accused the U.S. of wanting to control </p><p>Iraqi oil and protect the Israeli occupation of </p><p>Palestine.  He denied that his country had been </p><p>uncooperative with UN inspections over the past 12 </p><p>years, and that neighboring countries supported the </p><p>removal of Saddam Hussein.  In his interview, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter dismissed any USG motivation to </p><p>control Iraqi oil and voiced USG support for a Middle </p><p>East peace process that satisfies Israeli and </p><p>Palestinian objectives for peaceful co-existence.  He </p><p>once again clarified the lack of any linkage between </p><p>the suspension of USG military assistance under the </p><p>IMET and FMF programs and the GON position on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  This comprehensive media schedule during the last </p><p>week of March succeeded in educating the Nigerian </p><p>media and public on the suspension of U.S. military </p><p>assistance and the absence of any linkage to Nigeria\'s </p><p>position on the war with Iraq.  In the aftermath of </p><p>his clarification to the press as well as the Embassy </p><p>press statement on the issue, little media attention </p><p>to the story has ensued - what little that has </p><p>appeared consists of reader reaction to the </p><p>Ambassador\'s remarks.  During the first week of April, </p><p>the Mission issued a detailed press release on the </p><p>arrival of two Balsam-class coastal vessels, donated </p><p>by the USG to the Nigerian Navy.  Nigerian media </p><p>coverage of the boats\' arrival in Lagos on the heels </p><p>of the Embassy\'s clarification on the suspension of </p><p>military assistance has assisted Mission efforts to </p><p>close the door on further allegations of any linkage </p><p>between the suspension and the GON\'s position on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  On Iraq, the Nigerian media has handled the issue </p><p>in varying fashion:  most papers provide balanced, </p><p>factual reporting, a few others are negatively biased, </p><p>while others (in typical Nigerian fashion) are </p><p>interested in focusing on topical, but sensationalist </p><p>aspects of the war - Iraqi casualties, anti-war </p><p>protests around the world, the future of the UN, and </p><p>the impact of the war on oil prices.  Post appreciates </p><p>Washington PD materials, and will continue to seek </p><p>broad placement in the Nigerian media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
