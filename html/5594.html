TWENTY-TWO ELECTION COUNCIL MEMBERS INDICTED IN </p><p>SIIRT </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  In Pervari\'s (Siirt) Dogan Village, </p><p>during the November 3 Parliamentary elections, </p><p>ballot boxes which should have been set up during </p><p>the elections were not, which resulted in the </p><p>cancellation of the elections in Siirt.  Later, the </p><p>Pervari Prosecutor\'s Office ordered 22 election </p><p>council officials to pay fines of TL 218 million </p><p>(approx. USD 130) each.  The fines were based on </p><p>Article 136/1 of the Election Law number 298. </p><p>However, the officials refused to pay the fines. </p><p>A criminal case has been opened against them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  WAR EXERCISES </p><p>(Sabah/Bolge)  Adana\'s Incirlik Air Base had </p><p>another busy day on February 5.  Exercises began </p><p>with alarms early in the morning and continued all </p><p>day long.  Measures against possible terrorist </p><p>attacks were reviewed.  Different scenarios were </p><p>implemented against chemical weapons attacks, </p><p>fires, and air raids.  While the exercises were </p><p>going on, Turkish Air Forces affiliated F-4 Phantom </p><p>warplanes landed at the base.  Some U.S. F-117 </p><p>ghost war planes will reportedly be deployed at </p><p>Incirlik.

"Operation Rain </p><p>Plan," aimed at preventing a wave of refugees from </p><p>Iraq and providing humanitarian assistance, is </p><p>being implemented.  In the event of a war, 400 </p><p>tents set up in the region will also be used, if </p><p>tents set up in northern Iraq fail to suffice. </p><p>Hurriyet reported that journalists were not allowed </p><p>to watch the February 5 exercise in Silopi, while </p><p>the number of journalists in the region has </p><p>increased.

RADAR DOME BACK IN SERVICE </p><p>(Hurriyet)  Radar Dome at Diyarbakir\'s Pirinclik </p><p>Air Base, which Americans evacuated six years ago, </p><p>has gained importance in preparations for a </p><p>possible operation against Iraq.  The Dome, which </p><p>helps listen from the Middle East to Russia and can </p><p>detect a possible nuclear attack 28 minutes in </p><p>advance, has been put back into operation.  New </p><p>pre-fab dwellings have been established at the base </p><p>and walls around military equipment heightened. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.

A pistol, </p><p>15 rounds of ammunition and Hizbullah documents </p><p>were also confiscated.  Following interrogation, </p><p>the arrestees were arraigned in a local court, </p><p>where 13 suspects were ordered to remain in </p><p>custody.
