<p>S E C R E T  DOHA 001748 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PTER, ECON, ETTC, QA </p><p>SUBJECT: IN-HOUSE VIEWS ON POTENTIAL HAMAS TARGETS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KABUL 1810 </p><p>     B. STATE 194837 </p><p>     C. STATE 193410 </p><p>     D. DOHA 2536 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR MAUREEN QUINN FOR REASONS 1.5 (b) AND (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) SUMMARY. The organizations named in ref B, Qatar </p><p>Charitable Society (QCS), Sheikh Eid bin Mohammed Charitable </p><p>Society and the Qatari Joint Committee for Relief, are three </p><p>of the four charitable entities in Qatar (the fourth is the </p><p>Qatar Red Crescent Society). The GOQ is committed to </p><p>combating terrorist financing and has demonstrated a strong </p><p>willingness to cooperate with USG efforts. Absent concrete </p><p>information specifically linking these organizations to </p><p>terrorist activity, post has not engaged the GOQ regarding </p><p>them. To designate these organizations now, individually or </p><p>as a group, without apparent cause or justification, would </p><p>send a strong negative signal to the GOQ and the Qatari </p><p>public about the bilateral relationship. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>QATAR CHARITABLE SOCIETY </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The "United Way" of Qatar, Qatar Charitable Society is </p><p>the largest charitable organization in Qatar and conducts the </p><p>majority of charitable activities and fundraising in the </p><p>country. QCS took decisive measures in late 2002 to prevent </p><p>misuse of funds or other resources for illegal purposes </p><p>(detailed ref D).  These steps included a new focus on </p><p>domestic charitable activities and reorganization of </p><p>management. The GOQ has tightened every aspect of charitable </p><p>oversight without USG prodding. Designating QCS at this time </p><p>would suggest that these efforts were not sufficient or </p><p>effective. Qatar Charitable Society has kept an office open </p><p>in the Palestinian territories given the plight of the </p><p>Palestinian people. This office might have some contacts with </p><p>Hamas. If Washington agencies have specific information in </p><p>that regard, we would want to share it with the GOQ for </p><p>investigations and any appropriate action. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Additionally, in late 2002 a new QCS Chairman, Sheikh </p><p>Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman al Thani, was named. In addition to </p><p>his position with QCS, Sheikh Abdulaziz also serves as the </p><p>Chairperson of the Royal Family Council, which has the </p><p>constitutional mandate of investing the nation\'s ruler. </p><p>Designating QCS could be interpreted as a slur against Sheikh </p><p>Abdulaziz and the ruling al Thani family as a whole. Sheikh </p><p>Abdulaziz works closely with the Organization of Islamic </p><p>Conference Fund for Afghanistan, established in Doha in 2001. </p><p>He is also involved with Microsoft and supported their </p><p>opening an office in the Qatar Science and Technology Park </p><p>this spring. </p><p> </p><p>QATARI JOINT COMMITTEE FOR RELIEF </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman also serves as the </p><p>Chairperson of this committee. To the best of post\'s </p><p>knowledge, this is not an operating charitable organization </p><p>as much as a relief entity that targets specific needs. </p><p>Usually the organization is addressed as the Qatari Joint </p><p>Relief Committee for Afghanistan, Qatari Joint Relief </p><p>Committee for Iraq, etc. GOQ officials have previously </p><p>reported that the Joint Committee is a quasi-government </p><p>entity and donations may be both public and private. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) In the past two years, the Joint Committee has been </p><p>very active in Afghanistan and has recently focused on Iraq. </p><p>The Joint Committee for both was announced publicly along </p><p>with information on how Qatari citizens and others could make </p><p>donations for the specific needs in these countries. </p><p>Fundraising telethons are generally used to solicit initial </p><p>donations. Ref A outlines Sheikh Abdulaziz\'s recent visit to </p><p>Afghanistan to discuss application of Qatari Joint Relief </p><p>Committee for Afghanistan projects, as well as private and </p><p>GOQ donations, with the Afghan and U.S. officials. </p><p> </p><p>SHEIKH EID BIN MOHAMMAD CHARITABLE SOCIETY </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) This, the smallest charity in Qatar, is not well known </p><p>to the Embassy due to its small size. GOQ officials have </p><p>previously reported that the organization does little </p><p>international charitable work. Sheikh Eid bin Mohammad al </p><p>Thani is a royal family member. If Washington agencies have </p><p>significant concerns about this group, post would like to </p><p>have the opportunity to engage key GOQ decision-makers on the </p><p>organization\'s activities in order to gather more useful </p><p>details. The organization has at least two offices in Doha. </p><p>One office is about a half mile from the Embassy and the </p><p>second is around the corner from the Ambassador\'s residence. </p><p>Post has not visited either facility to date. Post might also </p><p>be able to develop more information by pursuing some contacts </p><p>with this group. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) COMMENT. Qatar remains a committed and active partner </p><p>in the international war on terrorism and efforts to combat </p><p>terrorist financing. As reported previously, the GOQ has </p><p>repeatedly taken independent steps to control local </p><p>charitable organizations and strengthen oversight over </p><p>foreign donations. These steps have shown tangible and </p><p>immediate results. Post strongly argues against designating </p><p>these three organizations. They are either doing the right </p><p>thing or we have not shared information beforehand with the </p><p>GOQ that allows it to take pre-emptive action. Post believes </p><p>engaging the GOQ directly and privately regarding our </p><p>concerns for these three organizations\' connections to Hamas </p><p>is the best way to achieve desired results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QUINN </p><p></p></div>
