(E) 00 KATHMANDU 1643 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary and Action Request:  In an April 16 meeting </p><p>with the Ambassador, Commerce Secretary Lawa Prasad Devkota </p><p>requested that the USG show greater flexibility in accepting </p><p>Nepal\'s revised WTO offers.  As a long-time development </p><p>partner, it is "kind of incumbent" upon the US to assist </p><p>Nepal in its efforts to accede to WTO, Devkota said.  The </p><p>Secretary also reiterated long-standing requests for the USG </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to provide Nepal with technical assistance in customs </p><p>valuation.  Nepal expects to provide the WTO Secretariat with </p><p>a consolidated response to all Working Party members\' </p><p>reactions to their revised offers by the end of April.  In </p><p>separate meetings with the Ambassador on April 15 and with </p><p>econoff on April 16, two visiting officials from the WTO </p><p>Secretariat similarly urged that the USG moderate its </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>reaction to Nepal\'s revised offers.  Action Request:  INL has </p><p>apparently decided not to fund our FY 03 proposal to provide </p><p>technical assistance in customs valuation to Nepal.  The </p><p>Embassy urges INL to reconsider this decision.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>COMMERCE ASKS FOR GREATER LEEWAY </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  In an April 16 meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>Commerce Secretary Lawa Prasad Devkota asked that the USG </p><p>demonstrate greater flexibility in its reactions to Nepal\'s </p><p>revised WTO offers (Reftel).  The Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>is committed to meeting all requirements to accede, Devkota </p><p>stressed.  Citing the history of cordial bilateral </p><p>cooperation between the two governments, Devkota said he </p><p>regards it as "kind of incumbent" upon all of Nepal\'s </p><p>development partners to support the process.  He said he </p><p>found it surprising that two of Nepal\'s most munificent </p><p>bilateral donors--the U.S. and Japan--were the two countries </p><p>with the most stringent reactions to Nepal\'s revised offers. </p><p>Devkota also raised the GON\'s outstanding request for </p><p>technical assistance on customs valuation from the USG.  The </p><p>EU has already agreed to provide assistance on sanitary and </p><p>phytosanitary measures, while Australia has agreed in </p><p>principle to assist in complying with TRIPS regulations. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Joint Secretary Prachanda Man Shrestha raised USG </p><p>requests on binding tariffs and financial services market </p><p>access as areas of particular concern.  The GON will be </p><p>unable to accommodate the USG request on binding tariffs </p><p>because applied rates have not stabilized, he said.  Instead, </p><p>the GON has proposed binding tariffs at an average of between </p><p>30 and 45 percent.  The GON will be unable to compromise much </p><p>more than that, he indicated.  With respect to financial </p><p>services, Shrestha noted that the GON has offered to open up </p><p>60 subsectors--more than any other LDC has offered.  The GON </p><p>has already agreed to assess zero percent duty on information </p><p>technology, Shrestha observed, but needs a certain amount of </p><p>"transition time" to absorb this change. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The Ambassador responded that the USG would like to </p><p>assist Nepal to accede to the WTO.  With no Parliament, Nepal </p><p>is an unusual situation, he observed, and there is concern in </p><p>some quarters about whether ordinances passed during this </p><p>interim period will survive as binding legislation once </p><p>Parliament resumes.  He noted that officials from the WTO </p><p>Secretariat now in Kathmandu seem fairly optimistic about </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Nepal\'s prospects.  That said, the GON will have to work </p><p>quickly to ensure that its responses to each of the Working </p><p>Party members\' reactions are ready by the end of April. </p><p>Joint Secretary Shrestha said that the GON will provide the </p><p>WTO Secretariat with a consolidated response to all Working </p><p>Party members\' reactions before the next Working Party </p><p>meeting at the end of April. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>WTO Secretariat in Nepal </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Ambassador met with Hector Millan and Arif </p><p>Hussain, Director of the Accessions Division, of the WTO </p><p>Secretariat on April 15.  During their brief exchange, the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Secretariat officers reiterated the GON\'s complaints and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>called for the USG to "step back" from its latest negotiating </p><p>position.  On April 16, Millan presed econoff again, </p><p>criticizing the demands of the USG.  Specifically, he saw the </p><p>demand to bind tariffs on industrial goods as out of step </p><p>with the regional tariff structure and beyond the standards </p><p>of other developing countries already members of the WTO. </p><p>Millan also dismissed USG requests for preferences, including </p><p>chemical harmonization and information technology items.  In </p><p>terms of trade in services, Millan commented that the USG </p><p>demands were "out of step."  (Comment:  Despite Millan\'s </p><p>vehement opposition to the USG position, he was ignorant of </p><p>Nepal\'s blacklist of industries, regulatory barriers to </p><p>foreign investment (let alone the barriers in practice), and </p><p>of the negotiation stance taken by the GON on binding rates. </p><p>End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Our exchanges in Kathmandu indicate that the GON </p><p>will likely stress its status as an LDC to justify requests </p><p>for more lenient treatment.  Based on the comments made by </p><p>the two officials visiting from Geneva, it also seems likely </p><p>that the Secretariat is encouraging this position.  The </p><p>Embassy supports the GON\'s request for technical assistance </p><p>in customs valuation, which, apparently, the USG committed to </p><p>provide at the first Working Party meeting in Geneva in 2000 </p><p>(Ref D).  So far, however, we have been unable to identify a </p><p>source of funding for such assistance.  We understand that </p><p>our request for INL funding to support the customs valuation </p><p>training appears unlikely to be granted (Refs B and C).  We </p><p>urge INL to reconsider its apparent decision not to fund </p><p>customs valuation assistance for Nepal. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
