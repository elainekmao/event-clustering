<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001842 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, MAY 5: KUWAITI POWS; KUWAITI </p><p>ROLE IN RECONSTRUCTION; ABU MAZEN; SHIIA IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: The lead news story this week is the effort to </p><p>account for Kuwaiti POWs still missing in Iraq, with </p><p>frustration growing at the lack of information on the POWs </p><p>despite the detention and interrogation of former regime </p><p>officials. </p><p> </p><p>Kuwait should not only have a role in rebuilding Iraq\'s </p><p>infrastructure, one commentator believes, but also "a role </p><p>in the reconstruction of the Iraqis as people." According to </p><p>news reports, Kuwait\'s Ministry of Education has established </p><p>a panel to suggest reforms in the Iraqi educational </p><p>curricula that taught Kuwait was a province of Iraq. On </p><p>government in Iraq, one writer states that the US will never </p><p>allow a Shiite government in Iraq, even if it is </p><p>democratically elected. </p><p> </p><p>The US presence in Iraq is seen as useful if it will bring </p><p>about a solution to the Palestinian issue. However, one </p><p>commentator dismisses Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu </p><p>Mazen) as "the latest Israeli innovation." END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: The Kuwaiti POW issue was the lead story </p><p>this week, with all papers reporting that top Kuwaiti </p><p>officials raised the issue with Secretary of Defense </p><p>Rumsfeld during his April 29-May 1 visit to Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>The Council of Ministers announced on May 5 that a POW </p><p>search team has been created under the authority of the </p><p>Minister of Interior Sheikh Mohammad Al-Khaled, Al-Qabas </p><p>reports. </p><p> </p><p>Faculty of Science students at Kuwait University staged a </p><p>sit-in in support of Kuwaiti POWs on May 5, Al-Anba reports. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassah reports that Kuwait University pedagogy </p><p>professors will meet to formulate recommendations on </p><p>reforming the Iraqi educational curricula that will be </p><p>passed to a new Iraqi government through the Kuwaiti </p><p>Ministry of Education. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports that Arab League Secretary General </p><p>Amir Mousa\'s visit to Kuwait has been postponed to avoid an </p><p>escalation of rhetoric during the coming election season in </p><p>Kuwait due to popular animosity towards the Arab League and </p><p>its anti-war stance. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports on its front page on May 5 that the </p><p>conservative Islamist Salafi Movement is predicting a </p><p>decrease in the number of Islamist MPs after the </p><p>parliamentary elections scheduled for July of this year. </p><p> </p><p>GCC joint defense "Peninsula Shield" forces that were </p><p>stationed in Kuwait during the war in Iraq will depart on </p><p>May 5, according to Al-Qabas. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "What Do We Need from America?" </p><p>Mubarak Al-Hajiri wrote in independent Al-Watan (5/03): </p><p>"Looking back at America\'s history, I believe that they are </p><p>honest about [their intentions in] Iraq because America has </p><p>never occupied any country in the past. We do not need to </p><p>believe the Americans, but we do need to take advantage of </p><p>their presence to solve the Palestinian crisis. We should </p><p>thank them for what they have done so far, but we also need </p><p>a just, fair and comprehensive solution of the Palestinian </p><p>crisis and to save the Palestinians from Sharon." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Iraq is not a Needy Nation" </p><p>Liberal Kuwait University Political Science Professor, Ahmad </p><p>Al-Baghdadi wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (5/03):  "Iraq. </p><p>is not the poor country that the US and Britain attempt to </p><p>portray it as to the world after the liberation. Iraq\'s </p><p>assets are estimated in the billions of dollars in French </p><p>banks, which were the revenues of the oil for food program. </p><p>We will preserve the dignity of the Iraqi people if this </p><p>money is used to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people, </p><p>instead of humiliating the Iraqis by offering them </p><p>assistance as we have seen on the media." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Where are the Arabs from Iraq?" </p><p>Liberal Secretary General of the Kuwait Journalists </p><p>Association, Faisal Al-Qanai wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Seyassah (5/04):  "Why did not the Arabs volunteer to assist </p><p>the Iraqi people by working at Iraqi hospitals or other </p><p>vital ministries in Iraq instead of demonstrating against </p><p>the war? Why haven\'t we seen one truck loaded with </p><p>humanitarian assistance heading to Iraq from Arab countries? </p><p>Kuwait was the only country, which sent humanitarian </p><p>assistance for the Iraqis while the Arabs kept reiterating </p><p>slogans and burning American flags. The Arab street is just </p><p>a "rhetoric street," and will never be active in any way." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "What Comes After the Detentions?" </p><p>Lawyer Rashed Al-Radaan wrote in independent Al-Watan </p><p>(5/04):  "Until now, we have not heard that any [Iraqi </p><p>regime] detainees have revealed facts about the Kuwaiti </p><p>POWs, WMD or the whereabouts of Saddam and his sons. </p><p>Moreover, we have not heard one statement from them that </p><p>could be useful for the Iraqi people. The Iraqis need to </p><p>hear the facts about their former regime that led them to </p><p>the current situation." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Abu Mazen: the Latest Israeli Innovation" </p><p>Salafi Editor in Chief of Al-Furqan Islamic Magazine, Dr. </p><p>Wael Al-Hasawi wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (5/04): </p><p>"In order for Israel to have full dominion in this region, </p><p>it has instituted a Palestinian leadership [allied to </p><p>Israel] through the appointment of Abu Mazen as the first </p><p>Palestinian Prime Minister. Israel has granted Abu Mazen </p><p>much authority and has frozen out Arafat, who gave Israel </p><p>everything it needed. Abu Mazen is known as a major </p><p>supporter of the Oslo agreements, and . and he as a </p><p>supporter of ending all attacks on Israel." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "Another Iraq" </p><p>Dr. Yacoub Al-Sharah wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(5/04):  "Kuwait\'s role in rebuilding Iraq should not be </p><p>limited to the reconstruction of Iraq\'s infrastructure. We </p><p>must have a role in the reconstruction of the Iraqis as </p><p>people. We should have a role in teaching the Iraqis how to </p><p>be tolerant with other, how to forgive and how to respect </p><p>others. We must help the Iraqis create a new educational </p><p>curricula for the children of Iraq in order to [build] a </p><p>better and secure future for Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "The Shiia and the Americans" </p><p>Salah Al-Fadhli wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (5/04): </p><p>"The US is striving to avert the establishment of a Shiia </p><p>regime in Iraq because it realizes that such a Shiia regime </p><p>would contribute to losing Iraq as it lost Iran in the past. </p><p>The US use the pretext that Iraq is not ready for full </p><p>democracy in order to prevent the Shiia from leading Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
