<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 001890 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>S/CT MICHAEL KRAFT; DS/ATA GEORGE FREDERICK; AND DOJ/OPDAT </p><p>JESSICA WILSON. </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, KCRM, PGOV, PTER, COSI </p><p>SUBJECT: OBSERVATIONS FROM SRI LANKA/MALDIVES DELEGATES </p><p>REGARDING ATA COUNTER TERRORISM LEGISLATION SEMINAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 189710 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) From September 8 to September 13, AmEmbassy Colombo </p><p>Assistant Regional Security Officer, Philippe Furstenberg, </p><p>accompanied delegations from Sri Lanka and Maldives to </p><p>Washington, D.C. for an ATA counter-terrorism legislation </p><p>seminar.  Per reftel request the following observations were </p><p>provided by members of the delegation to the A/RSO both </p><p>during and after the seminar: </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Both delegations noted the importance of conducting </p><p>the CT seminar in a regional context.  Many conversations </p><p>between delegations during coffee breaks and over lunch </p><p>resulted in relationships developed among regional </p><p>counterparts. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) With very little exception, both delegations felt the </p><p>CT seminar was extremely valuable and worthwhile.  It became </p><p>apparent that the five participating countries differed </p><p>greatly in their state of legislative drafting.  Sri Lanka </p><p>was among the countries with the most comprehensive </p><p>counter-terrorism laws.  This is in large part due to the </p><p>20-year war Sri Lanka has been engaged in against an </p><p>FTO-listed terrorist group.  The Maldives, on the other hand, </p><p>does not even have a formal criminal code and needs further </p><p>assistance developing the legal framework for countering </p><p>terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Nonetheless, much of the conversation within both the </p><p>Sri Lankan and Maldivian delegations centered around </p><p>enforcement assistance.  There was widespread belief that </p><p>assistance with creation of immigration and criminal </p><p>databases to track known and potential terrorists would be of </p><p>great value.  Further integration of this database with </p><p>regional partners would be of additional import. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Sri Lanka and the Maldives noted their lack of </p><p>sophistication in attacking money laundering.  A </p><p>comprehensive law is in the final stages of development in </p><p>both countries, but the issue of enforcement is clearly a </p><p>weak point.  Sri Lanka and the Maldives request assistance </p><p>with creation and training of Financial Investigation Units </p><p>(FIU) </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Sri Lanka further emphasized its wish to conclude a </p><p>Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the United States. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Since the seminar, the US Embassy in Sri Lanka has </p><p>already taken action to assist the Maldives and Sri Lanka in </p><p>their counter-terrorism efforts: </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) On September 30, 2002 the USG and the Attorney General </p><p>of the Maldives signed a grant proposal in which the USG will </p><p>provide two slots to the Maldives Law Commission to attend </p><p>the Tulane University Legislative Drafting course in New </p><p>Orleans.  This proposal was crafted in part due to the </p><p>immediate feedback given to the U.S. Embassy regarding the </p><p>ATA course.  Conversations with one delegate from the </p><p>Maldives and member of the Law Commission noted that several </p><p>important CT laws have been preliminarily drafted and await </p><p>refinement by the law commission.  This includes a securities </p><p>act, a telecommunications act, a customs act and a civil </p><p>aviation act.  The proposal for FY ,03 will assist in </p><p>reducing the back log and tightening the Maldives </p><p>counter-terrorism posture. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) In addition, a State Department-funded Sri Lanka </p><p>Police management and organization proposal (principally </p><p>geared at counter-narcotics) has been more than doubled.  An </p><p>expected $400,000 will be spent in FY ,03 to improve the </p><p>Police,s ability to track crime and share criminal </p><p>intelligence. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Both the Maldives and Sri Lanka appreciate any USG </p><p>assistance that can be provided.  Whether through the </p><p>extremely successful ATA program, INL or any other source, </p><p>both countries could use assistance with enforcement training </p><p>and legislative drafting. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The seminar was a good beginning that we look forward </p><p>to capitalizing on. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
