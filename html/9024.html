State witness Perence Shiri, Zimbabwe </p><p>Air Force Commander, told the court that the MDC had </p><p>requested his assistance in the event of the MDC winning the </p><p>March 2002 presidential poll--but had not asked him to help </p><p>overthrow Mugabe.

On legal grounds the </p><p>defense\'s application for discharge appears solid; however, </p><p>the judge could easily decide to continue this case, under </p><p>pressure from the GOZ, as part of the GOZ\'s campaign to </p><p>discredit opposition President Morgan Tsvangirai.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Defense Files for Discharge </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The State closed its case and the Defense filed for </p><p>discharge in the fourteenth week of Morgan Tsvangirai\'s </p><p>(first) treason trial.  According to defense attorney </p><p>Innocent Chagonda, the defense argued in court on June 26 </p><p>that the State had not argued a case worthy to answer to. </p><p>Judge Paddington Garwe adjourned the trial until July 7 to </p><p>enable both sides to prepare their arguments pertaining to </p><p>this motion. </p><p> </p><p>Air Force Commander Denies Coup Plot </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On June 23 State witness Perence Shiri, Zimbabwe Air </p><p>Force Commander, told the court that the MDC had requested </p><p>his assistance in the event of the MDC winning the March 2002 </p><p>presidential poll, and had offered him financial payment for </p><p>such assistance.  This testimony contradicted earlier </p><p>statements by witness Ari Ben Menashe that the MDC had asked </p><p>Shiri to help engineer a coup against President Mugabe. </p><p> </p><p>Transcribers: Tape Inaudible </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) On June 24 and 25 the court heard testimony by three </p><p>State witnesses who transcribed the video and audio tapes: </p><p>government transcriber, Constantine Musango; state-run </p><p>Zimbabwe Broadcasting Company (ZBC) television and </p><p>broadcasting manager, Edward Chinhoyi; and Tineyi Nyawasha, </p><p>Director of a Harare electronics equipment hiring company. </p><p>Of the videotape, Musango said he told police that parts of </p><p>the tape were inaudible, that it was not clear who was saying </p><p>what because of the accents and background noise.  He said </p><p>police told him to transcribe what he could hear.  Musango </p><p>also said the tape supplied to him was a normal VHS tape, </p><p>i.e. not the original mini-cassette. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Nyawasha also said that parts of the videotape were </p><p>inaudible, and Chinhoyi testified that there was no evidence </p><p>that the videotape had been tampered with.  The defense </p><p>argued that there are a myriad of editing techniques that </p><p>could have been employed to make some parts inaudible, some </p><p>parts more audible, and to cut and paste sections of speech </p><p>to attribute them to alternate speakers. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Yet again this week, the testimonies of State </p><p>witnesses tended to support the defense\'s case more than the </p><p>prosecution\'s--that there was no plot to assassinate Mugabe </p><p>and engineer a coup, and the videotape was inaudible and not </p><p>original.  On legal grounds the defense\'s application for </p><p>discharge appears solid; however, the judge could easily </p><p>decide to continue this case, under pressure from the GOZ, as </p><p>part of the GOZ\'s campaign to discredit opposition President </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
