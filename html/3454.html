<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004377 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST AND IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, August 6, focuses </p><p>on Israel\'s increased measures of isolation against </p><p>Palestinian towns and cities, and highlight Israel\'s </p><p>bombing of Gaza in response to the Palestinian suicide </p><p>bombing.  Front-page reports also highlight the </p><p>Security Council\'s deliberation regarding Iraq\'s </p><p>invitation for a visit by the inspectors.  The same </p><p>reports highlight Washington\'s rejection of Iraq\'s </p><p>similar invitation to Congress to visit Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>          Editorial Commentary on Middle East </p><p> </p><p>-- "Who convinces Bush of his responsibility for the </p><p>violence" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(08/06):  "President Bush alone has the power to drive </p><p>the Palestinian-Israeli confrontation out of this </p><p>cycle of murder and violence and towards just and </p><p>peaceful solutions.  This fact means that the </p><p>President of the United States bears the </p><p>responsibility of the consequences of his Middle East </p><p>policy.  By adopting policies that support Sharon\'s </p><p>military operations and political objectives, </p><p>President Bush has pushed the Palestinians into a spot </p><p>where life and desperation are one and the same.  The </p><p>Palestinians\' belief in the justice of their cause and </p><p>their struggle has nothing to do with the nature of </p><p>the ruling regime.  Their struggle with Israel and its </p><p>occupation has everything to do with defending the </p><p>identity, the land and the homes.  It has everything </p><p>to with their right to live like human beings, to </p><p>determine their own destiny on their own soil, as </p><p>opposed to giving in to the invaders who want to </p><p>uproot them altogether from geography and history." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Israeli measures reflect the Sharon government\'s </p><p>political bankruptcy" </p><p> </p><p>Semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i </p><p>(08/06) editorializes:  "The iron-fist measures </p><p>adopted by the Sharon government against the </p><p>Palestinian civilians reflect more a political and </p><p>military bankruptcy rather than a vision towards </p><p>seriously reviving the peace process or towards </p><p>learning the lessons from events over the past few </p><p>months.  All these measures have proven futile in </p><p>breaking the will of the Palestinian people and in </p><p>forcing them to surrender and give up their national </p><p>rights.  Israel\'s insistence on continuing to use </p><p>force, oppression, destruction and arrests means that </p><p>it is firing a fatal bullet into the peace process and </p><p>thwarting all efforts, without actually providing an </p><p>alternative or a political project that can be </p><p>adopted." </p><p> </p><p>-- "It is the Palestinian people\'s expensive war for </p><p>independence" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the semi- </p><p>official, influential Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i (08/06): </p><p>"the Palestinian war for independence continues. </p><p>Sharon is responsible for the killing of Israelis and </p><p>Palestinians, because he is entrenching his occupation </p><p>with blood and is denying the Palestinians their </p><p>freedom and security.  We could differ in opinion </p><p>about the type and usefulness of Palestinian </p><p>operations, but that is a minor detail.  The </p><p>Palestinian people\'s war for independence continues. </p><p>Those who can do anything to bring this day closer </p><p>must do, and those who cannot must shut up.  The </p><p>Palestinian path to independence is hard and requires </p><p>support and encouragement, and not people who stand in </p><p>the way.  As long as there is occupation, there is </p><p>either humiliation or blood.  I believe the </p><p>Palestinians have already opted for the second." </p><p>             Editorial Commentary on Iraq </p><p> </p><p>-- "Legal concerns" </p><p> </p><p>If the United States is to launch a war against Iraq </p><p>soon, what legitimizes such an attack from both </p><p>national and international perspectives?  U.S. </p><p>Democratic Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the </p><p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee raised the specter </p><p>of the legality of waging war against Iraq without </p><p>congressional consent.  Internationally, an attack by </p><p>any U.N. member state against another must reckon with </p><p>the U.N. Charter.  None of the existing U.N. Security </p><p>Council resolutions on Iraq offers a legal basis for a </p><p>fresh attack on Baghdad.  What complicates and even </p><p>clouds the issue of whether to start a war against </p><p>Iraq is the incoherence of the rationale offered to </p><p>explain the urgency of such a war.  For national and </p><p>international purposes, one wonders what really is the </p><p>ultimate objective of a U.S. war on Iraq.  Is it the </p><p>toppling of the Iraqi regime led by Saddam Hussein? Or </p><p>is it the elimination of all real or imaginary weapons </p><p>of mass destruction existing on Iraqi soil?  Better </p><p>still, Washington could very well be aiming to achieve </p><p>the two goals simultaneously.  In either case, before </p><p>the U.S. president is able to seek and obtain </p><p>congressional consent to go to war against Iraq, he </p><p>must first articulate his purpose to the House and </p><p>Senate.  And if Bush succeeds in convincing the U.S. </p><p>Congress that his justifications for going to war are </p><p>legitimate, he will still have to reckon with </p><p>international authority.  Against these backdrops, the </p><p>United States would remain ill put to rationalize and </p><p>legitimize an attack against Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
