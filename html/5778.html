<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000292 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  PARTIES BOYCOTT PM\'S MEETING ON PEACE </p><p>INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 0198 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Five of the six parties that had MPs in the previous </p><p>Parliament boycotted a February 17 meeting called by Prime </p><p>Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand to discuss Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) efforts to begin negotiations with Maoist </p><p>insurgents.  The all-party meeting, which the GON had billed </p><p>as an effort to brief and consult with the parties on its </p><p>peace initiative, drew attendance only from Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Badri Prasad Mandal\'s Nepal Sadbhavana Party, along </p><p>with representatives from a host of smaller, </p><p>non-Parliamentary parties.  Citing the lack of participation </p><p>from Parliamentary parties, PM Chand\'s own National </p><p>Democratic Party (RPP) stayed away from the meeting as well, </p><p>although RPP General Secretary Pashupati S.J.B. Rana </p><p>reportedly met with the PM one hour before the scheduled </p><p>all-party meeting as an apparent compromise. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The Nepali Congress (NC) Party (Koirala) did not </p><p>attend the meeting because the party has not recognized the </p><p>constitutionality of Chand\'s interim government, according to </p><p>NC Party member Basant Gautam.  Gautam added that the NC will </p><p>formulate its own position on possible peace talks with the </p><p>Maoists after the Feb. 19 Democracy Day holiday.  RPP Central </p><p>Committee Member Khem Raj Pandit told the Embassy that while </p><p>his party is "positive" about the peace process and stands </p><p>ready to assist in any way it can, it did not attend the </p><p>meeting because of the presence of non-parliamentary parties. </p><p> Chaitya Raj Shakya, Central Committee member of the far-left </p><p>Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, told us that his party had </p><p>boycotted the meeting both because it does not recognize the </p><p>Chand government and because it believes an all-party meeting </p><p>should not include parties not represented in the previous </p><p>Parliament. Instead of the current Chand government, an </p><p>all-party government should be formed to address negotiations </p><p>with the Maoists, he added. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment: The major parties criticized the January </p><p>29 announcement of the ceasefire between GON forces and the </p><p>Maoists for its lack of "transparency" (Reftel)--which, in </p><p>Nepal\'s political shorthand, translates to the parties\' </p><p>collective disgruntlement at the interim government bypassing </p><p>them to take the initiative in seeking a peaceful resolution </p><p>to the insurgency.  This initial GON effort toward greater </p><p>"transparency" has obviously failed to mollify the parties or </p><p>to appease their fears of marginalization.  The GON knows it </p><p>will need the support of the principal political parties in </p><p>order to engage successfully with the Maoists.  So far, </p><p>however, GON overtures to win such support continue to </p><p>founder on the parties\' refusal to deal with the interim </p><p>Chand government. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
