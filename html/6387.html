<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000709 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE, NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; SERBIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "Diplomacy\'s last days" </p><p>The conservative National Post opined (3/14): </p><p>"...Barring some blockbuster discovery by the </p><p>inspectors, or an over-the-top sabre-rattling gesture </p><p>from Saddam, the United States and Britain have little </p><p>chance of convincing their opponents on the Security </p><p>Council to explicitly sign off on an invasion - and it </p><p>is only a matter of days before they give up the UN </p><p>procedure entirely. Given the stubborn pacifism of </p><p>France et al., such exasperation is understandable. </p><p>Still, Washington and London should make every effort </p><p>to bring the matter up for a vote at the Security </p><p>Council - even in a losing cause. If they can get the </p><p>minimum nine votes needed to pass the resolution, </p><p>either the French or Russians will be forced to block </p><p>it by exercising their veto power. It will then be </p><p>clear to all who is responsible for the United </p><p>Nations\' slide into irrelevance." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Bush, Blair must give Iraq time" </p><p>The liberal Toronto Star editorialized (3/14): "It\'s </p><p>amateur hour at the United Nations. If this is Friday, </p><p>U.S. President George Bush must be pounding home his </p><p>view that Saddam Hussein is \'evil\' and needs to be </p><p>whacked. Or that he threatens New York with horror </p><p>weapons. Or that he\'s gearing to hammer Israel. Or that </p><p>he\'s thumbing his nose at the U.N. Security Council. </p><p>It\'s getting hard to keep track of Bush\'s restless </p><p>rationales for war.... Rarely have American and British </p><p>leaders looked so misguided, so ineffectual and so </p><p>isolated. Meanwhile, Saddam sits in </p><p>Baghdad, gloating. This is what comes of trying to </p><p>bamboozle, bully and bribe an otherwise united Security </p><p>Council into a wrongheaded, needlessly </p><p>rushed war.... Yes, Saddam is a dangerous criminal who </p><p>must be denied nuclear, chemical and biological </p><p>weapons. Security Council resolution 1441, passed </p><p>unanimously last Nov. 8, demands that. But it doesn\'t </p><p>mandate what Bush really wants: Saddam\'s ouster. Nor </p><p>does it require Iraq disarm by Sunday, as Bush has </p><p>demanded. And for good reason. Saddam has been held in </p><p>check for 12 years. He does not seriously threaten the </p><p>United States, Britain or any other country. He can be </p><p>contained.... Making war on Iraq must be a last resort. </p><p>It could cost $100 billion, result in tens of </p><p>thousands of deaths and create new recruits for terror. </p><p>That\'s a high price to pay for Saddam\'s head. </p><p>Especially if Baghdad can be disarmed within weeks </p><p>if the Security Council remains united and presses its </p><p>demands. But it\'s amateur hour. This farce isn\'t over </p><p>yet." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "UN must authorize war:" </p><p>In a CBC Radio commentary (3/12), international affairs </p><p>columnist for the leading Globe and Mail Marcus Gee </p><p>reflected that, "However the Iraq crisis turns out, one </p><p>good thing has already come out of it. Everybody is </p><p>talking about the United Nations. Suddenly, the U.N. </p><p>matters. Everybody on both sides of the Iraq debate </p><p>agrees on that.... Saddam Hussein has tried for 12- </p><p>years to get weapons of mass destruction, making his </p><p>country an international pariah, putting his people </p><p>through years of sanctions and allied bombing, and </p><p>foregoing tens of billions of dollars in oil </p><p>revenue.... An Iraq armed with weapons of mass </p><p>destruction, and bent on vengeance for its defeat in </p><p>the Gulf War, would present a risk not just to its </p><p>neighbours, but to the whole world. But have all means </p><p>short of war been tried? Again the answer has to be </p><p>yes. We\'ve had 12-years of diplomacy and sanctions and </p><p>every other kind of non-military pressure. None of it </p><p>has worked. The anti-war camp wants more inspections. </p><p>But inspectors will never uncover Saddam\'s weapons if </p><p>he does not want to give them up. And once the threat </p><p>of war comes off, Saddam will simply stop co-operating </p><p>again. The United Nations Security Council has passed </p><p>17- resolutions demanding Iraq\'s immediate disarmament. </p><p>This week it\'s likely to vote on an 18th. This time it </p><p>must make sure its words mean something. If it misses </p><p>this chance to show it can confront real threats to the </p><p>world, the United States and other big powers will </p><p>simply ignore it next time and the institution will </p><p>become a global non-entity." </p><p> </p><p>SERBIA </p><p>4.   "Serb hope shot dead" </p><p>The centrist Winnipeg Free Press commented (3/14): </p><p>"...Since the fall of Mr. Milosevic, Serbs have been </p><p>politically apathetic. Twice they have failed to turn </p><p>out in democratic elections in sufficient numbers to </p><p>elect a president. Serbia now has an acting president, </p><p>an acting prime minister, an acute political crisis - </p><p>and a challenge to ensure that the good that Zoran </p><p>Djindjic accomplished is not interred with his bones, </p><p>that his dream of a free, democratic, prosperous Serbia </p><p>does not die with him." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
