<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 005212 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI/SAUMS </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN GEARS UP FOR ARAB FREE TRADE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  WITH TRADE WITH OTHER ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES MAKING UP A SIZEABLE PORTION OF ITS OVERALL </p><p>TRADE, JORDAN WAS ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES TO </p><p>EMBRACE THE ARAB FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (AFTA), WHICH </p><p>AIMS AT CREATING AN ARAB FREE TRADE AREA BY 2005. </p><p>INDEED, SINCE ENTERING INTO FORCE, JORDAN HAS SEEN THE </p><p>AFTA CREATE NEW REGIONAL OUTLETS FOR ITS INDUSTRY, </p><p>BLUNTING THE IMPACT ON JORDAN\'S INDUSTRY OF WTO </p><p>MEMBERSHIP AND THE U.S.-JORDAN FTA AND ARGUABLY MAKING </p><p>THE COUNTRY MORE ATTRACTIVE TO FOREIGN INVESTORS. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE COVERAGE OF AFTA IS EXPANDING AS LISTS OF </p><p>EXEMPTED GOODS DIMINISH AND WITH DISCUSSIONS SLATED ON </p><p>EXTENDING IT TO TRADE IN SERVICES, DOUBTS PERSIST AS </p><p>TO WHETHER THE AFTA WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN RAISING </p><p>INTER-ARAB TRADE OVERALL, THUS HAVING A POSITIVE, </p><p>TRADE-CREATING IMPACT ON REGIONAL ECONOMIES.  HOW THE </p><p>AFTA TREATS FREE TRADE ZONES, LIKE JORDAN\'S AQABA </p><p>SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE OR DUBAI\'S JEBEL ALI, IS A MAJOR </p><p>QUESTION MARK.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>JORDAN\'S TRADE WITH ARAB COUNTRIES </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  TRADE WITH ARAB COUNTRIES ACCOUNTED FOR 28 </p><p>PERCENT OF JORDAN\'S TOTAL TRADE VOLUME IN 2001 AND </p><p>MUCH OF THE PAST DECADE.  CONSEQUENTLY, ARAB COUNTRIES </p><p>COMBINED REPRESENT JORDAN\'S LARGEST TRADING PARTNER, </p><p>FOLLOWED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION (WHICH ON AVERAGE </p><p>ACCOUNTS FOR 24 PERCENT OF JORDAN\'S TRADE) AND THE </p><p>UNITED STATES (WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR SOME 9.5 PERCENT OF </p><p>JORDAN\'S TRADE IN 2001).  THIS MAKES JORDAN\'S RATIO OF </p><p>INTER-ARAB TRADE ONE OF THE HIGHEST, IF NOT THE </p><p>HIGHEST, AMONG ARAB COUNTRIES, COMPARED WITH AN </p><p>AVERAGE OF 8.7 PERCENT FOR ALL ARAB COUNTRIES </p><p>COMBINED.  THE ARAB COUNTRIES WITH WHICH JORDAN TRADES </p><p>THE MOST ARE IRAQ, SAUDI ARABIA, THE UAE, SYRIA, </p><p>LEBANON AND EGYPT.  IRAQ AND SAUDI ARABIA CONSTITUTE </p><p>JORDAN\'S FIRST AND FOURTH BIGGEST TRADING PARTNERS </p><p>RESPECTIVELY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) A CLOSER LOOK AT JORDAN\'S TRADE DATA WITH ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES SHOWS THAT CRUDE OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, </p><p>WHICH ARE IMPORTED EXCLUSIVELY FROM IRAQ, MAKE UP THE </p><p>BIGGEST PORTION OF JORDAN\'S ARAB TRADE (SOME 35 </p><p>PERCENT) AND AROUND 10 PERCENT OF JORDAN\'S OVERALL </p><p>TRADE VOLUME.  JORDAN IMPORTED JD 821.2 MILLION (USD </p><p>1,149.7 MILLION) OF PRODUCTS FROM ARAB COUNTRIES IN </p><p>2001, REPRESENTING 24 PERCENT OF TOTAL IMPORTS.  CRUDE </p><p>OIL AND PETROLEUM IMPORTS ACCOUNTED FOR 58 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE TOTAL, FOLLOWED BY FOODSTUFFS, PLASTIC PRODUCTS, </p><p>ALUMINUM, IRON AND STEEL.  JORDAN EXPORTED JD 542.5 </p><p>MILLION (USD 764.9 MILLION) OF PRODUCTS TO ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES IN 2001 REPRESENTING SOME 40 PERCENT OF </p><p>TOTAL EXPORTS.  PHARMACEUTICAL EXPORTS CAME FIRST WITH </p><p>21 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, FOLLOWED BY VEGETABLES, PAPER </p><p>AND CARDBOARD, PLASTIC BAGS, FODDER, AND CEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) JORDAN HAS LONG HAD A TRADE DEFICIT WITH ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES, AVERAGING AROUND 50 PERCENT OF EXPORTS OVER </p><p>THE PAST THREE YEARS.  THIS IS NOT SURPRISING, SINCE </p><p>JORDAN, WITH ITS LIMITED RESOURCE BASE, HAS </p><p>HISTORICALLY SUFFERED FROM AN OVERALL TRADE DEFICIT. </p><p>OIL IMPORTS COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF THE </p><p>DEFICIT WITH ARAB COUNTRIES, AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE </p><p>SIZE OF THIS DEFICIT FLUCTUATES ALMOST IN TANDEM WITH </p><p>MOVEMENTS IN THE PRICE OF OIL. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>THE ARAB FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (AFTA) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) ARAB COUNTRIES\' EFFORTS AT REGIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION LONG FAILED TO PRODUCE TANGIBLE RESULTS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH TALK OF A COMMON MARKET STARTED IN THE </p><p>1950\'S.  HOWEVER, IN MARCH 1998, ELEVEN ARAB COUNTRIES </p><p>ESTABLISHED THE ARAB FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (AFTA) ALSO </p><p>KNOWN AS THE GREATER ARAB FREE TRADE AREA (GAFTA) OR </p><p>PAN-ARAB FREE TRADE AREA (PAFTA).  THEIR NUMBER LATER </p><p>INCREASED TO FOURTEEN COUNTRIES INCLUDING: LEBANON, </p><p>JORDAN, SYRIA, EGYPT, MOROCCO, TUNISIA, IRAQ, LIBYA </p><p>AND SIX MEMBERS OF THE GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (GCC) </p><p>NAMELY BAHRAIN, KUWAIT, OMAN, QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA AND </p><p>THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  NOTE THAT JORDAN IS PURSUING ITS </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN AFTA ON A SEPARATE TRACK FROM </p><p>BILATERAL AND SUB-REGIONAL EFFORTS TO LIBERALIZE ITS </p><p>TRADE WITH ARAB COUNTRIES.  THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE THE </p><p>"AGADIR PROCESS" OF COUNTRIES WITH EU ASSOCIATION </p><p>AGREEMENTS, TRADE, TRANSPORT AND CUSTOMS AGREEMENTS </p><p>WITH SYRIA, KUWAIT, EGYPT AND OTHERS.  THESE </p><p>AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY LESS AMBITIOUS, IN TIMING </p><p>AND/OR IN COVERAGE, THAN THE AFTA, AND ARE SOMETIMES </p><p>DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) UNDER THE AFTA, MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO AFFORD </p><p>GOODS PRODUCED IN OTHER MEMBER STATES NATIONAL </p><p>TREATMENT, RESULTING IN REDUCED TARIFFS, FEES AND </p><p>TAXES ACCORDING TO A GRADUAL LIBERALIZATION SCHEDULE </p><p>STARTING JANUARY 1998.  INITIALLY, THE TARIFF </p><p>REDUCTION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 10 PERCENT ANNUALLY, </p><p>THEREBY ESTABLISHING A FREE TRADE AREA BY 2007. </p><p>MEMBER COUNTRIES AGREED AT THE BEIRUT ARAB SUMMIT IN </p><p>MARCH 2002 TO ADVANCE THE DATE OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE </p><p>FREE TRADE AREA TO 2005 BY REDUCING EXISTING TARIFFS </p><p>BY 50 PERCENT IN 2002, TEN PERCENT IN 2003 AND 20 </p><p>PERCENT IN BOTH 2004 AND 2005.  IN ADDITION, ARAB </p><p>LEADERS AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO INCLUDE THE </p><p>LIBERALIZATION OF TRADE IN SERVICES IN FUTURE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  ACCORDING TO SAMER TAWIL, SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL OF JORDAN\'S MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE, </p><p>THIS YEAR\'S TARIFF REDUCTION HAS ALREADY BEEN </p><p>IMPLEMENTED FOR ALL MEMBER STATES EXCEPT FOR MOROCCO, </p><p>WHICH IMPLEMENTED A 30 PERCENT TARIFF REDUCTION ONLY. </p><p>THE REMAINING REDUCTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE ON JANUARY </p><p>FIRST OF EACH YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  WHILE THE MOST OBVIOUS SHORTCOMING OF THE </p><p>AFTA IS THAT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO SERVICES, ITS </p><p>COVERAGE OF GOODS ALSO LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED. </p><p>WHEN THE AFTA WAS SIGNED, MEMBER COUNTRIES ADOPTED </p><p>LONG, WIDE-RANGING LISTS OF EXEMPTED PRODUCTS </p><p>(NEGATIVE LISTS), PURPORTEDLY TO ALLOW NATIONAL </p><p>INDUSTRIES TIME TO ADJUST TO COMPETITION.  UNDER THE </p><p>AGREEMENT, THESE LISTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TEMPORARY IN </p><p>NATURE AND SHOULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 15 PERCENT </p><p>OF TOTAL INTER-ARAB TRADE VOLUME.  INDEED, LOCAL </p><p>EXPERTS SAY THAT NEGATIVE LISTS AMOUNT TO LESS THAN 6 </p><p>PERCENT OF INTER-ARAB TRADE.  THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE </p><p>SLATED TO BE DROPPED BY SEPTEMBER 16, 2002, WITH </p><p>MEMBER COUNTRIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO INTRODUCE NEW ONES </p><p>WITHOUT A DETAILED EXPLANATION.  HOWEVER, DOUBTS </p><p>LINGER IN BOTH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE JORDANIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AS TO WHETHER ALL AFTA MEMBERS WILL ABIDE </p><p>BY THIS STIPULATION.  IN PARTICULAR, MORE THAN ONE </p><p>CONTACT EXPRESSED DOUBT THAT EGYPT WILL REALLY </p><p>ELIMINATE ITS LIST OF EXEMPTED TEXTILE GOODS OR THAT </p><p>MOROCCO WILL DO SO FOR ITS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  MEMBER COUNTRIES ALSO STILL NEED TO FINALIZE </p><p>THE ISSUE OF COUNTRY OF ORIGIN RULES AND PROCEDURES. </p><p>GENERALLY SPEAKING, TO QUALIFY FOR PREFERENTIAL </p><p>TREATMENT UNDER AFTA, GOODS HAVE TO SHOW A 40 PERCENT </p><p>VALUE-ADDED IN THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND A SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>TRANSFORMATION.  AN ARAB LEAGUE ECONOMIC COUNCIL </p><p>(ALEC) MEETING NEXT SEPTEMBER WILL DISCUSS THE ISSUE </p><p>MORE THOROUGHLY, INCLUDING A PROPOSAL TO TIGHTEN RULES </p><p>OF ORIGIN ALONG THE LINES OF EU STANDARDS, WHICH ARE </p><p>FAR STRICTER: 50 PERCENT LOCAL CONTENT WITH ONLY </p><p>CERTAIN PRODUCTION PROCESSES QUALIFYING TOWARDS THAT </p><p>TOTAL.  FINALLY, PROBLEMS OF STANDARDS AND TECHNICAL </p><p>BARRIERS TO TRADE (TBT\'S) PERSIST AND A WORKING GROUP </p><p>HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED UNDER THE ALEC TO VISIT MEMBER </p><p>STATES AND STUDY THEIR CUSTOMS PROCEDURES IN ORDER TO </p><p>MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ALEC ON HOW TO REDUCE THEM. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>PROJECTED IMPACT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO TAWIL, AFTA WILL INCREASE </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR JORDANIAN EXPORTERS TO COMPETE WITH </p><p>LOWER COST ASIAN -- PARTICULARLY CHINESE -- </p><p>COMPETITORS IN OTHER ARAB MARKETS.  HE ESPECIALLY </p><p>NOTED SYRIA AND SAUDI ARABIA AS PROMISING.  LOWER </p><p>DUTIES, TARIFFS AND TAXES, AND -- ESPECIALLY -- LOWER </p><p>TRANSPORTATION COSTS, HE SAID, WOULD COMPENSATE FOR </p><p>RELATIVELY HIGHER LABOR AND PRODUCTION COSTS IN JORDAN </p><p>COMPARED TO EAST ASIA.  BY OPENING ARAB MARKETS, THE </p><p>JORDANIANS ALSO HOPE AFTA WILL SOFTEN THE BLOW OF </p><p>JORDAN\'S WTO MEMBERSHIP AND THE U.S.-JORDAN FTA ON </p><p>SMALLER, LESS COMPETITIVE JORDANIAN PRODUCERS WHO </p><p>CATERED TO THE LOCAL MARKET AND SEEN THEIR MARKET </p><p>SHARE DIMINISH.  TAWIL ALSO ARGUES THAT THE </p><p>COMBINATION OF THE AFTA WITH THE U.S. FTA AND EU </p><p>ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT WILL MAKE JORDAN MORE ATTRACTIVE </p><p>TO FOREIGN INVESTORS AS A REGIONAL TRADING HUB. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  ALREADY SOME BENEFITS ARE MEASURABLE: LAST </p><p>YEAR, JORDAN\'S EXPORTS TO ARAB COUNTRIES GREW BY 23 </p><p>PERCENT.  THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THIS YEAR HAVE SEEN </p><p>A 17 OR 18 PERCENT INCREASE.  ACCORDING TO TAWIL, </p><p>EXPORTS TO SYRIA ARE UP BY MORE THAN 100 PERCENT LED </p><p>BY AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS, WHICH ARE UP BY 250 PERCENT. </p><p>IN ADDITION, EXPORTS TO ALGERIA ARE UP BY 180 PERCENT, </p><p>WHILE EXPORTS TO IRAQ ARE UP BY 10 PERCENT SO FAR THIS </p><p>YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, HOWEVER, IS MORE </p><p>SKEPTICAL.  REPORTS OF CUMBERSOME AND ARBITRARY </p><p>CUSTOMS PROCEDURES COUPLED WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT </p><p>IGNORANT AND INEFFICIENT CUSTOMS OFFICIALS ABOUND FROM </p><p>JORDANIAN EXPORTERS.  THE GAP BETWEEN POLICY AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION CAN BE VERY WIDE, ESPECIALLY IN </p><p>COUNTRIES LIKE IRAQ AND SYRIA, WHERE THE TECHNICAL </p><p>EXPERTISE AND PAY OF CUSTOMS OFFICIALS IS VERY LOW. </p><p>SOME FOOD AND PHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCERS REPORTED TO US </p><p>AN ENDLESS SAGA OF COSTLY DELAYS AND EXPENSIVE BRIBES </p><p>WHEN TRYING TO GET THEIR PRODUCTS THROUGH UNDER THE </p><p>LATEST TARIFF REDUCTIONS TO SYRIA.  IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>PLETHORA OF TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE AND THE FICKLE </p><p>NATURE OF INTER-ARAB RELATIONSHIPS -- AS MANIFESTED IN </p><p>A RECENT KUWAIT-JORDAN TARIFF WAR OVER TRUCK TRANSPORT </p><p>FEES -- RENDERS DOING BUSINESS IN THE ARAB REGION AN </p><p>UNPREDICTABLE GAME. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>FREE TRADE ZONES EXCLUDED? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  A CONCERN OF DIRECT BEARING ON U.S. </p><p>COMPANIES IS HOW THE AFTA TREATS PRODUCTS OF DOMESTIC </p><p>TAX-FREE OR "FREE TRADE" ZONES.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>JORDANIAN TRADE MINISTRY, AFTA MEMBERS SIGNED AN </p><p>AGREEMENT THIS SPRING THAT EXCLUDED EXPORTS OF SUCH </p><p>ZONES FROM THE BENEFITS OF AFTA PENDING FURTHER STUDY </p><p>BY MEMBERS.  IN MANY CASES, THIS HAS ACTUALLY RESULTED </p><p>IN AN INCREASE IN TARIFFS ON EXPORTS FROM THESE ZONES </p><p>TO AFTA MEMBERS.  FOR EXAMPLE, ONE U.S. COMPANY WITH A </p><p>REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN JEBEL ALI HAS </p><p>COMPLAINED THAT IT NOW FACES NEW JORDANIAN TARIFFS OF </p><p>30% ON PROCESSED FOOD PRODUCTS BROUGHT IN FROM DUBAI, </p><p>FIVE TIMES THE PREVIOUS RATE.  IF THIS STAYS, THIS </p><p>WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE A MAJOR GAP IN THE AGREEMENT THAT </p><p>WORKS AGAINST GREATER REGIONAL AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION </p><p>FOR THE ARAB WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  IN A WORLD OF REGIONAL TRADING BLOCS AND </p><p>TRADE AGREEMENTS, INTER-ARAB TRADE REMAINS VERY LOW </p><p>AND FRAGMENTED.  AFTER TAKING OUT OIL AND MINERALS, </p><p>INTER-ARAB TRADE IS ONLY 16 PERCENT OF TOTAL ARAB </p><p>TRADE AND IS LARGELY CONCENTRATED ON TRADE IN </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE.  THE ARAB FREE TRADE AGREEMENT </p><p>(AFTA) INITIATIVE IS AIMED AT ADDRESSING THIS DISMAL </p><p>STATE OF AFFAIRS BY TRYING TO CREATE AN ARAB FREE </p><p>TRADING AREA OF SORTS AND EVEN ARRIVING IN DUE COURSE </p><p>AT AN ARAB CUSTOMS UNION.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE VARYING </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS IN ARAB COUNTRIES AND </p><p>SMALL AMOUNT OF INTER-ARAB TRADE, A NAFTA- OR EU-TYPE </p><p>TRADE BLOC SEEMS FARFETCHED.  IN ADDITION, THE AFTA </p><p>ITSELF HAS A NUMBER OF LOOPHOLES THAT NEED TO BE </p><p>CLOSED, RANGING FROM RULES OF ORIGIN TO LONG LISTS OF </p><p>EXEMPTED PRODUCTS EXTENSIVE TBT\'S, AS WELL AS </p><p>EXCLUSION OF FREE TRADE ZONES.  THESE WILL GREATLY </p><p>DAMPEN THE GROWTH POTENTIAL SUCH AN AGREEMENT COULD </p><p>PROVIDE.  THAT SAID, TO THE EXTENT THE AFTA IS </p><p>IMPLEMENTED, COUNTRIES LIKE JORDAN THAT HAVE TAKEN </p><p>BOLDER STEPS AT ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION ALREADY STAND </p><p>TO GAIN THE MOST -- AS THE INCREASED TRADE FIGURES OF </p><p>THE LAST 18 MONTHS SUGGEST. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
