(U) THE MDC\'S NATIONAL COUNCIL DECIDED AT AN </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY MEETING NOVEMBER 24 (REFTEL) TO CANCEL </p><p>PLANS FOR MASS ACTION.  THE NOVEMBER 25 "THE HERALD" </p><p>QUOTED MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AS SAYING MASS </p><p>ACTION HAD BEEN "DEFERRED INDEFINITELY."  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>ALSO STATED THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR MASS ACTION WOULD </p><p>BE "CONSTANTLY REVIEWED" TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO HOLD EARLY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS DUE BY </p><p>MID-2000. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF NOVEMBER 27, </p><p>HOWEVER, MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE SAID THE </p><p>MDC HAS CANCELED ALTOGETHER PLANS FOR MASS ACTION AND </p><p>THAT THE MATTER WOULD NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED.  THE MDC </p><p>IS SAYING PUBLICLY THAT MASS ACTION IS BEING "DEFERRED" </p><p>AND "POSTPONED" TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT GUESSING, BUT, IN </p><p>REALITY, IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE MDC WILL EVER </p><p>ORGANIZE ANY FORM OF MASS ACTION BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS, NCUBE EMPHASIZED.  THE MDC BELIEVES THAT THE </p><p>SUCCESS OF MASS ACTION CANNOT BE ASSURED, AND THAT, </p><p>UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS NOT IN THE COUNTRY\'S BEST </p><p>INTEREST TO ENCOURAGE A "SAVAGE RESPONSE" FROM THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  NCUBE STATED THAT HIS PARTY HAD INFORMATION </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS PLANNING A STATE OF EMERGENCY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06584  271305Z </p><p>AND BRUTAL CRACKDOWN IF MASS ACTION CAME TO PASS.  THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL REPRESENTATIVES ALSO REPORTED AT THE COUNCIL </p><p>MEETING THAT THE CIO HAS HEAVILY INFILTRATED THE MDC\'S </p><p>PROVINCIAL STRUCTURES, AND THAT, AFTER BEING INFORMED BY </p><p>THE CIO, THE ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION (ZBC) </p><p>ANNOUNCED DECEMBER 6 AS THE DATE FOR MASS ACTION.  THIS </p><p>REMOVED THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE, NCUBE CONTINUED, AND </p><p>WAS ANOTHER REASON FOR CANCELING THE MASS ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN SPEAKING TO PAUL NYATI, MP FOR GWANDA NORTH </p><p>AND MDC DIRECTOR OF ELECTIONS, ON NOVEMBER 27 ON THE </p><p>MARONDERA WEST BY-ELECTION (TO BE REPORTED SEPTEL), </p><p>POLOFF ALSO LEARNED THAT CONSULTATIONS WITH MDC RURAL </p><p>STRUCTURES ON MASS ACTION HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED OR </p><p>THOROUGHLY COORDINATED.  A NUMBER OF MDC MEMBERS HAD </p><p>MADE TOO MANY STATEMENTS ABOUT UPCOMING MASS ACTION </p><p>PLANS FOR IT TO BE A REAL SURPRISE TO THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>NYATI STATED.  THE MP ALSO CITED MEMBERS AS WANTING TO </p><p>BE WITH THEIR FAMILIES OVER THE HOLIDAYS AS AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL REASON FOR CANCELING THE MASS ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: THE NATIONAL COUNCIL\'S DECISION FOLLOWS </p><p>THE MDC MODUS OPERANDI:  THREATEN AND PLAN POLITICAL </p><p>ACTION, BUT BACK OFF AT THE LAST MINUTE WHEN VIOLENCE </p><p>SEEMS INEVITABLE.  IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT WESTERN </p><p>COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE US, PLAYED A ROLE IN </p><p>DISCOURAGING ACTIONS THAT COULD LEAD TO VIOLENCE.  IT IS </p><p>UNCLEAR WHETHER THE MDC\'S "RADICAL" WING AND YOUTH </p><p>ELEMENTS IN HARARE WILL ACCEPT THE DECISION.  A SPLIT IN </p><p>THE MDC REMAINS A POSSIBILITY AND SOME RADICAL ELEMENTS </p><p>COULD STILL TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06584  271305Z </p><p>IT PROBABLY WILL DIFFUSE TENSION IN THE SHORT-TERM, THE </p><p>CANCELLATION OF MASS ACTION COULD ALSO TAKE THE WIND OUT </p><p>OF THE MDC\'S SAILS AND LEAVE THE OPPOSITION IN LIMBO </p><p>UNTIL THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2002.  FURTHERMORE, </p><p>THE MDC COULD BRING THE MASS ACTION PROPOSAL BACK TO </p><p>CENTER STAGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 IF DAILY </p><p>LIVING CONDITIONS GET AS BAD AS EXPECTED HERE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
