<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 006059 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/SAT AND EUR/ERA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: TSPA, ETTC, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN TRANSPORT MINISTER DISCUSSES GALILEO WITH </p><p>DE PALACIO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC MINISTER </p><p>COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER. REASONS 1.5B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY. ON 4 DECEMBER DCM MET WITH MINISTRY OF </p><p>TRANSPORT INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS COUNSELOR EMILIO MARAINI AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06059  191120Z </p><p>OUTLINED USG VIEWS ON THE PROPOSED OVERLAY OF GPS M-CODE BY </p><p>THE PUBLIC REGULATED SERVICE (PRS) OF THE GALILEO SATELLITE </p><p>NAVIGATION SYSTEM.  DCM ALSO DELIVERED A LETTER FROM </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO MINISTER OF TRANSPORT LUNARDI. IN A DEC 12 </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH MARAINI, POST LEARNED THAT LUNARDI HAD USED </p><p>THE LETTER TO OPEN A PERSONAL DISCUSSION ON M-CODE WITH </p><p>TRANSPORT COMMISSIONER DE PALACIO. HOWEVER, DE PALACIO\'S </p><p>ASSISTANT ILBRECHT INSISTED THAT THE OVERLAY PROBLEM COULD BE </p><p>SOLVED BY MODULATION OF THE PRS SIGNAL RATHER THAN MOVING PRS </p><p>TO A SEPARATE SEGMENT OF SPECTRUM. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) DCM CALLED ON MARAINI ON THE EVE OF HIS DEPARTURE </p><p>FOR THE DEC.5 TRANSPORT COUNCIL TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE THE </p><p>USG ATTACHES TO MOVING GALILEO\'S PROPOSED PRS TO A FREQUENCY </p><p>WHICH WOULD NOT OVERLAY THAT OF U.S. M-CODE.  DCM STRESSED </p><p>THAT THE USG WAS NOT OPPOSED TO THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM, IN FACT </p><p>SAW POSSIBLE BENEFITS FOR USERS OF GALILEO AND GPS, BUT </p><p>SIMPLY COULD NOT ACCEPT THE RISKS TO U.S. AND NATO MILITARY </p><p>OPERATIONS AND PERSONNEL THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE OVERLAY </p><p>OF VITAL M-CODE BY GALILEO\'S PROPOSED PRS.  DCM UNDERLINED </p><p>THAT NO TECHNICAL FIX WAS POSSIBLE, AND THAT THE EU NEEDED TO </p><p>TAKE THE POLITICAL DECISION TO ABANDON THE IDEA OF FREQUENCY </p><p>OVERLAYS.  HE CONCLUDED BY POINTING TO OUR LONG STANDING </p><p>POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL BILATERAL COOPERATION AS AN </p><p>INDICATION THAT A SOLUTION COULD BE FOUND. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) MARAINI-- IN HIS JOB JUST A FEW MONTHS--WAS AWARE OF </p><p>USG VIEWS, BUT SAID THAT THE TRANPORT MINISTERS LACKED THE </p><p>COMPETENCE TO ENTER INTO THE MILITARY ASPECTS OF GALILEO, </p><p>SINCE THE COMMISSION MANDATE WAS CIVILIAN AND COMMERCIAL.  HE </p><p>EXPECTED THE MINISTERS TO INDICATED THE NEED FOR THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06059  191120Z </p><p>COMMISSION TO STUDY SERIOUSLY POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS IN CLOSE </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. HE PROMISED TO DELIVER THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S LETTER TO MINISTER LUNARDI, AND TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>ISSUES WITH THE MINISTER EN ROUTE TO BRUSSELS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) POST LEARNED ON DECEMBER 12 FROM MARAINI THAT MINISTER </p><p>LUNARDI HAD RAISED USG CONCERNS WITH TRANSPORT COMMISSIONER </p><p>DE PALACIO ON THE MARGINS OF THE COUNCIL.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MARAINI, LUNARDI STRESSED THE NEED TO ADDRESS USG SECURITY </p><p>CONCERNS RESPONSIVELY. IN HER REPLY THE COMMISSIONER CALLED </p><p>ON HER ASSISTANT ILBRECHT, WHO ARGUED THAT THE OVERLAY </p><p>PROBLEMS RAISED BY THE THE U.S. COULD BE RESOLVED BY </p><p>MODULATION OF PRS SIGNAL WITHOUT THE NEED TO MOVE PRS TO A </p><p>SEPARTE FREQUENCY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT. EMBASSY BELIEVES THAT ITALY, BECAUSE OF ITS </p><p>HIGH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STAKES IN GALILEO, WILL SUPPORT A </p><p>RESOLUTION OF THE OVERLAY ISSUE IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH </p><p>TENDERING THE PROJECT, WHICH COULD HAPPEN AS EARLY AS NEXT </p><p>JUNE. HOWEVER, THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT IS NOT FULLY </p><p>CONVINCED THAT THE TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS OFFERED UP BY THE </p><p>COMMISSION ARE INFEASIBLE.  INDEED, MARAINI TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>U.S. STYLE-- IN HIS WORDS, NEGOTIATING BY ULTIMATUM--DID NOT </p><p>SIT WELL WITH EITHER ITALY OR THE COMMISSION. WE EXPECT THE </p><p>ITALIANS WILL WANT A CLEAR TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF WHY </p><p>SOLUTIONS PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION WILL NOT WORK. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME06059 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
