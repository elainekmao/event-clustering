IRVING FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE AMANI TRUST, A RESPECTED HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORING </p><p>ORGANIZATION IN ZIMBABWE, RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT </p><p>DETAILING THE CONTINUED VIOLENCE FOLLOWING THE JUNE 24-25 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  THE TRUST PUTS THE NUMBER OF </p><p>PEOPLE ASSAULTED OR OTHERWISE VICTIMS OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS </p><p>IN THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD AT ALMOST 900.  THESE INCLUDE 5 </p><p>DEATHS, 232 SERIOUS ASSAULTS, 8 RAPES (NOTE: IT IS NOTEWORTHY </p><p>THAT SO MANY RAPES HAVE BEEN REPORTED; RAPE IS </p><p>TRADITIONALLY A TABOO SUBJECT, A SOCIAL STIGMA EXAGGERATED </p><p>BY THE HIV/AIDS CRISIS.  END NOTE.), AND 18 DETENTIONS OR </p><p>ABDUCTIONS.  THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTED CASES OF VIOLENT </p><p>INCIDENTS AND DEATHS RISES DAILY; INCLUDED ARE MANY VICTIMS </p><p>WHO WENT UNDERGROUND BEFORE THE VOTING, FEARING </p><p>RETRIBUTION AND WHO ARE ONLY NOW APPEARING AT HOSPITALS </p><p>FOR TREATMENT OR AT NGOS TO REPORT THEIR EXPERIENCES.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THESE FIGURES ARE STILL LOW, AS </p><p>INTIMIDATION CONTINUES TO RUN HIGH -- ESPECIALLY WHERE IT </p><p>CONCERNS ATTACKS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE RURAL AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN THIS INCREASINGLY MURKY POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, IT IS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT A PARTICULAR REASON FOR THE CONTINUED </p><p>VIOLENCE.  THERE ARE PROBABLY MULTIPLE FACTORS.  CAUSES </p><p>VARY FROM ANGER OVER LOST SEATS IN PARLIAMENT BY THE </p><p>RULING PARTY, FEAR OF EVICTION FROM OCCUPIED LAND, DESIRE </p><p>FOR LAND, OR EVEN RANDOM VIOLENT EXPRESSIONS OF </p><p>FRUSTRATION AT ZIMBABWE\'S UNENDING ECONOMIC WOES (METED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04389  081603Z </p><p>OUT AGAINST SUPPOSED SUPPORTERS OF "WESTERN-LED", I.E., MDC </p><p>MEMBERS).  OFFICIALS AT THE AMANI TRUST BELIEVE THAT THE WAR </p><p>VETERANS GROUPS TERRORIZING FARMERS, WORKERS, AND ALLEGED </p><p>OPPOSITION MEMBER SUPPORTERS ARE INCREASINGLY </p><p>AUTONOMOUS, PRESSING THEIR CAMPAIGN IN AN EFFORT TO HOUND </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT TO RECALL THAT THEY ARE THE ONES WHO </p><p>SWUNG THE RURAL VOTE FOR ZANU-PF CANDIDATES.  EVEN IF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT FEELS THOSE OCCUPYING THE LAND HAVE OUTLIVED </p><p>THEIR USEFULNESS AND DISTANCES ITSELF FOR THEM, THEIR </p><p>CONTINUED CAMPAIGN OF TERROR NEVERTHELESS MAKES CLEAR </p><p>THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A STATE OF CHAOS IN THE </p><p>COUNTRYSIDE.  THIS, IN TURN, ENHANCES THEIR ROLE AS </p><p>POWERBROKERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE POLICE AND THE ARMY APPEAR TO BE PLAYING DIFFERENT </p><p>ROLES, DEPENDING ON WHERE IN THE COUNTRY IN THEY ARE </p><p>LOCATED.  IN SOME LOCALES, POLICE AND ARMY OFFICERS ARE THE </p><p>PERPETRATORS OF VIOLENCE (VARYING ESTIMATES PUT THEIR </p><p>PARTICIPATION AT 20-30%), WHILE IN OTHERS, THEY HAVE </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW ONLY TO BE RENDERED </p><p>HAPLESS BY MENACING GROUPS OF ZANU-PF YOUTHS, WAR </p><p>VETERANS, OR EVEN "HIGHER POWER" GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO </p><p>THREATEN TRANSFER OR DEMOTION.  PRESS REPORTS ALSO DEPICT </p><p>THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO), ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL SECURITY AGENCY, AS EXPERIENCING </p><p>INTERNAL DIVISIONS OVER THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THE VIOLENCE </p><p>- THOUGH THEIR ROLE NEVERTHELESS AS A CENTRAL </p><p>ORCHESTRATING AND FIELD MANAGEMENT ASSET REMAINS HIGH. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS VIOLENCE COULD BE </p><p>HALTED IF PRESIDENT MUGABE WISHED IT AND DECREED SO.  HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04389  081603Z </p><p>DESIRE TO PUSH THE LAND ISSUE AS A FOCAL POINT FOR THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN (REFTEL) ADDS FUEL TO THE FIRE, MAKES A </p><p>FURTHER DESCENT INTO LAWLESSNESS MORE PROBABLE, AND LENDS </p><p>CREDENCE TO THE BELIEF BY MANY THAT THIS UGLY ISSUE WILL </p><p>DRAG ON FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.  MEANWHILE, THE LIST OF </p><p>VICTIMS GROWS, AS DOES THE PUBLIC\'S SENSE OF FRUSTRATION AND </p><p>HELPLESSNESS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
