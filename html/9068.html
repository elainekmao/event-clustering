<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001134 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR: PM/B, L, T, P, D, IO, S/WCI, S/P, CWG/PM, </p><p>PM/AT, </p><p>AF FOR DAS BRIDGEWATER </p><p>AF/W FOR DAN EPSTEIN, </p><p>OSD/ISP/NP FOR LOOK, </p><p>DOD/OGC FOR ALLEN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/30/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MARR, MOPS, KTIA, NI, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA SIGNS ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On June 30, during a private signing ceremony at </p><p>the Ministry of Justice, Solicitor-General I.A. Ayua signed </p><p>the Article 98 Agreement on behalf of the Federal Republic </p><p>of Nigeria.  Ambassador Jeter signed on behalf of the </p><p>United States.  Signed original has been sent to L/T via </p><p>registered pouch 2105851. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) At first, Ayua said the GON saw Article 98 as a </p><p>treaty requiring ratification by the National Assembly. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter explained, however, that the Rome Statute, </p><p>by including Article 98 contemplated that a party to the </p><p>treaty would enter into such agreements.  Consequently, </p><p>when the Nigerian National Assembly ratified the Statute, </p><p>the Nigerian National Assembly also assented to the </p><p>possibility of Nigeria entering into such an agreement. </p><p>Because the Statute has been ratified, there was little </p><p>value or necessity in ratifying an act expressly approved </p><p>by the Statute. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Responding positively to this line of reasoning, </p><p>Ayua conceded that National Assembly ratification might not </p><p>be required afterall.  Ayua also mentioned that President </p><p>Obasanjo had told him he wanted the "entire issue behind </p><p>him" in time for President Bush\'s upcoming visit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) We are preparing a non-paper for the GON outlining </p><p>the argument in favor of treating Article 98 as an </p><p>Executive Agreement.  Obasanjo\'s desire to resolve the </p><p>issue before President Bush\'s visit may weigh heavily on </p><p>the GON\'s decision to handle this as an executive agreement </p><p>or treat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Ambassador also raised the possible desirability of </p><p>Nigerians concluding Article 98 agreements with member- </p><p>states in the West African Sub-region, recalling the </p><p>allegations of gross human rights abuses by Nigerian troops </p><p>taking part in peacekeeping operations in Liberia and </p><p>Sierra Leone.  Had the Rome Treaty existed at that time, </p><p>Nigerian soldiers could have been subject to the </p><p>jurisdiction of the Court, whether the allegations were </p><p>true or not.  The Solicitor-General took these points and </p><p>directed his staff to explore the possibility of concluding </p><p>Article 98 Agreements with member states of ECOWAS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In any event, President Obasanjo took a positive </p><p>and courageous decision.  Now we have Africa\'s largest </p><p>country on the right side of the Article 98 ledger.  We </p><p>should be able to use Nigeria\'s gravitational pull to </p><p>influence other African nations, especially other countries </p><p>in West Africa. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
