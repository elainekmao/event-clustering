<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 001535 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/ICI/PII, DS/IP/AF, DS/DSS/OSAC, DS/IP/ITA, </p><p>  DRL/MARINDA HARPOLE </p><p>VAIHINGEN FOR J-3-DSS/LNO </p><p>CAIRO FOR JAMES MAXSTADT </p><p>DOE FOR CAROLYN GAY AND GEORGE PERSON </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/ROBERT YOUNG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, EPET, ENRG, ECON, CASC, PGOV, PINR, PINS, PTER, NI, XA, XY </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  DELTA KIDNAPPING THREATENS OIL </p><p>PRODUCTION AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  A Nigerian white collar worker for Chevron </p><p>Nigeria Ltd. (subsidiary of Chevron/Texaco) and member of </p><p>the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association </p><p>(PENGASSAN) was kidnapped outside his home on July 25 by a </p><p>rogue group of armed Ijaw youths.  The kidnapping is the </p><p>latest in a series of similar events in the years-long </p><p>dispute between the Ijaws and the oil companies in the </p><p>region, including Chevron, over the Ijaws\' demands to share </p><p>in revenues from oil produced on their land.  PENGASSAN </p><p>joined the fray on July 29 by issuing an ultimatum demanding </p><p>that Chevron effect the release of its member within the </p><p>next seventy-two hours, or the union will call for a work </p><p>stoppage that will shut down all of Chevron\'s operations in </p><p>the area.   The deadline is midnight on Friday, August 1. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trouble, again, in the Delta </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   Chevron officials confirm the July 25 kidnapping of one </p><p>of its Nigerian Public Affairs officers, who was abducted as </p><p>he left his home in Warri early that morning.  Chevron adds </p><p>that a note was later sent to its Warri office by the </p><p>kidnappers demanding a large cash ransom.  According to </p><p>senior Chevron Security Officer Hamish MacDonald, Chevron is </p><p>determined not to accede to ransom demands for this or any </p><p>other kidnapped employee, local or expatriate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Short Term Motives </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   An Ijaw community leader, Doyah Tiemo, told EconOff on </p><p>July 30 that he had been in contact with the kidnappers and </p><p>was told that the reasons for the kidnapping were continuing </p><p>bad relations and lack of communication between the Ijaw </p><p>community and Chevron.  He cited two examples of unresolved </p><p>disputes between the parties that have been going on for at </p><p>least the past two years.  First, in December, 2002, two </p><p>rental boats carrying Ijaws from Warri to Chevron\'s Escravos </p><p>facility to meet with Chevron officials were seized by State </p><p>Security personnel and impounded.  The boats remain at the </p><p>Escravos facility at a loss to the Ijaws of 20,000 naira per </p><p>day (rate 1 USD equals 128 naria) with a cumulative loss to </p><p>date of close to 4.5 million naira.  Second, the Egbema </p><p>faction of the Ijaws continues to demand that Chevron stop </p><p>dealing with the former President of the faction.  The </p><p>Egbema claim this man is no longer authorized to represent </p><p>them, and they accuse him of collusion with Chevron staff to </p><p>steal monies paid to the Egbema by Chevron for offshore </p><p>slots.  The payments can be between 20,000 and 40,000 naira </p><p>per day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economic impact of continuing instability </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The simmering tensions between Chevron, PENGASSAN and the </p><p>Ijaws are about much more than seized boats and tribal </p><p>factions.  Both unions and local communities accuse oil </p><p>companies operating in the Nigerian Delta of failing to </p><p>ensure their safety and believe that employers can do more </p><p>to provide greater security and stability to communities </p><p>that support the industry.  Employers argue that oil </p><p>companies should not be pressured into assuming a </p><p>governmental function that extends well beyond their </p><p>corporate responsibility or objectives.  Since the GON </p><p>receives more than 80 percent of Nigeria\'s oil revenues, </p><p>according Cyril Odu, Exxon Mobil\'s human resources manager, </p><p>employers believe the GON is able to improve the quality of </p><p>life for Nigerians living in the Delta region.  However, the </p><p>government has failed to promote initiatives that might </p><p>reduce the region\'s growing security concerns and dependency </p><p>on the oil sector to resolve the region\'s social and </p><p>economic problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Long-term consequences </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  PENGASSAN\'s ultimatum to Chevron/Texaco highlights a </p><p>trend within the Nigerian labor movement that could have </p><p>long-term economic implications.  Individual unions, </p><p>particularly those in the oil sector, have become more </p><p>active in advancing a political agenda that extends outside </p><p>of the workplace. In response to Nigeria\'s lack of </p><p>influential non-governmental organizations equipped to </p><p>respond to issues facing the general public, oil sector </p><p>unions are increasingly assuming responsibility to serve as </p><p>the voice of civil society.  However, the lines between </p><p>labor disputes and social concerns are blurring and unions </p><p>are beginning to use industrial action as a way to resolve </p><p>issues unrelated to the workplace.  In this case, PENGASSAN </p><p>hopes to pressure Chevron on the larger issue of worker </p><p>safety for Nigerians as well as expats.  Responsible Ijaw </p><p>leaders are treating this incident as a criminal matter </p><p>(septel).  However, PENGASSAN is using it to promote a much </p><p>larger agenda: that of the same safety concerns for Nigerian </p><p>oil workers that expatriates are given. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment.  The big picture is that oil unions are using </p><p>their size and influence to shape the GON and private </p><p>sector\'s role in resolving the Delta\'s ongoing communal </p><p>crisis.  As oil unions become more active in these issues, </p><p>workplace concerns have become obscured. Prior to the recent </p><p>gas price hike, for example, the oil unions were negotiating </p><p>resolution of a dispute regarding safety concerns related to </p><p>employee-provided transportation to off-shore oil rigs. </p><p>Tensions resulted in a standoff between American-owned </p><p>Transocean and approximately one hundred oil workers who </p><p>held 68 expatriates hostage for several days.  However, the </p><p>safety issue at the core of the matter remains overshaowed </p><p>and unresolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Comment continued.  In addition to safe transportation </p><p>to oil rigs, salary increases for civil servants, and the </p><p>oil sector\'s use of contract labor, other labor issues </p><p>remain unresolved and are boiling beneath the surface.  The </p><p>ultimatum issued by PENGASSAN underscores the labor </p><p>movement\'s inability to separate its civic responsibility </p><p>from its labor interests.   As unions continue to exercise </p><p>their right to strike in response to conflicts between the </p><p>companies and the communities, employers will likely </p><p>experience more frequent strikes and threats of industrial </p><p>action.  The resulting disruptions to production and the </p><p>increased climate of instability will diminish the nation\'s </p><p>ability to attract investment and create much-needed jobs. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
