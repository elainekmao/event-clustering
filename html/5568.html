Powell demanded a UN decision for </p><p>military action, but other UNSC members prefer to continue </p><p>weapons inspections after analyzing the evidence put forth </p><p>by the U.S..  "Vatan" reports in a front-page banner </p><p>headline that almost all of Turkey is within the range of </p><p>new missiles developed by Iraq.  "Hurriyet" describes the </p><p>evidence given by the U.S. as `like a horror movie.\'  Prime </p><p>Minister Gul said on Wednesday that Turkey, in line with its </p><p>national interests, should act together with its strategic </p><p>ally, the United States.  Gul stressed that Turkey has </p><p>exerted all efforts for peace, and since all peaceful means </p><p>have been exhausted, has decided to join the U.S. in a </p><p>military action against Baghdad.  The government is expected </p><p>to submit to Parliament a draft authorizing modernization </p><p>work on Turkish bases by U.S. experts.  Gul said that </p><p>Ankara, in order to secure parliamentary approval on </p><p>February 18, would ask the U.S. for solid guarantees about </p><p>compensation for Turkey\'s economic losses in a possible war. </p><p>Papers speculate that Vice President Cheney, after speaking </p><p>to Gul on the phone on Tuesday, ordered Treasury U/S Taylor </p><p>to fly to Turkey to ease Ankara\'s concerns about war losses. </p><p>Dailies comment that Taylor was coming to Turkey to bargain </p><p>over the cost of a war, which Turkish economic ministry </p><p>bureaucrats estimate at $23.2 billion in a short-term </p><p>conflict.  Papers also claim that Turkey and the U.S. have </p><p>set up a subcommittee to discuss the restructuring of a post- </p><p>war Iraq.  Ankara is insistent that Turkomen should be </p><p>represented in a future Iraqi central administration, which </p><p>should be formed by the Iraqi people.  President Bush\'s </p><p>advisor on Iraq, Zalmai Halilzad will meet with MFA and </p><p>Northern Iraqi Kurdish and Turkoman representatives in </p><p>Ankara on Thursday.  The U.S. and the Northern Iraqi Kurds </p><p>want a federal Iraq, while Turkey demands a concrete </p><p>guarantee that the disintegration of Iraq will be prevented </p><p>after a war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator Tom Weston said in </p><p>Ankara on Wednesday that Iraq and Cyprus are separate </p><p>issues, and that Turkey should make a clear distinction </p><p>between the two.  MFA Spokesman Buluc disagreed with Weston, </p><p>saying that Iraq and Cyprus are strategic issues linked to </p><p>each other for both the U.S. and Turkey.  Meanwhile, papers </p><p>carry Greek Cypriot leader Clerides\' `shocking announcement\' </p><p>that the Greek side is ready to sign the UN plan and maps </p><p>without further changes.  Denktas, however, strongly opposed </p><p>Clerides, and said that the Turkish Cypriots would not </p><p>accept the plan without changes.  Denktas added that the </p><p>Greek Cypriots\' willingness to accept the agreement showed </p><p>their `true intentions.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Powell\'s presentation to the UNSC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Powell\'s presentation" </p><p>Mehmet Barlas commented in mass appeal Aksam (2/6): </p><p>"Powell\'s presentation to the UNSC is a serious development </p><p>in itself, and reminds me of previous actions by Washington. </p><p>The US has always acted unilaterally whenever it felt it </p><p>necessary and urgent.  . Secretary Powell\'s presentation </p><p>about Iraq is similar to the Libya case.  The US </p><p>administration presented the phone records between Tripoli </p><p>and the Libyan Embassy in East Germany, and then-president </p><p>Reagan ordered the US bombing of Libya, including the </p><p>residence of Qaddafi. . The phone records and other </p><p>documents presented by Secretary Powell are a clear </p><p>indication of the upcoming US strike." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The effect of the evidence" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (2/6): "The </p><p>presentation by Secretary Powell to the UNSC stirred a </p><p>debate in many countries about clarifying their positions in </p><p>the event of a war.  First of all, there are some question </p><p>marks which range from the validity of this proof to the </p><p>issue of legitimacy for conducting a military operation </p><p>based on them. . It remains to be seen what the reaction </p><p>will be, particularly by France and Russia but also in NATO </p><p>and the UN.  They all have to define the nature of their </p><p>support in case of a US military action against Iraq based </p><p>on the facts presented by Powell. . If a war is going to </p><p>happen - and most probably it will - Turkey should be </p><p>provided with a defense system prior to the strike.  This </p><p>requires a NATO decision.  NATO has failed to reach a </p><p>consensus on the issue thus far because of France and </p><p>Germany.  This has caused a serious weakness within the </p><p>Alliance.  We\'ll see whether they will change their attitude </p><p>following Powell\'s presentation.  If they don\'t, it will not </p><p>only harm NATO\'s credibility but also damage Turkey\'s trust </p><p>in the Alliance." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
