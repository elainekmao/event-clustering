<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 01646 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINS, PREL, LE, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  JA\'JA\'S "CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT": </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., MOTIVES, AND OBJECTIVES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIRUT 1635 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  POLOFF MET MARCH 15 WITH LONGTIME CONTACT NAOUM </p><p>FARAH, DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THE LEBANESE </p><p>FORCES AND NOW AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN JA\'JA\'S </p><p>"CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT."  FARAH, WHO UNTIL </p><p>EARLY MARCH WAS ALSO THE OFFICIAL LF SPOKESMAN, REQUESTED </p><p>THE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>3.  FARAH STATED AT THE OUTSET THAT THE LEBANESE FORCES </p><p>(WHICH HE CONSIDERS SYNONYMOUS FOR ALL INTENTS AND </p><p>PURPOSES WITH JA\'JA\'S "CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT") </p><p>HAD BEEN "BOTHERED" BY THE USG STATEMENT ON MARCH 13 </p><p>CHARACTERIZING EVENTS OF THAT DAY IN EAST BEIRUT AS </p><p>A "NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT."  HE ALSO EXPRESSED DISMAY </p><p>OVER STATEMENTS ORIGINATING IN WASHINGTON THAT AMERICAN </p><p>EMBASSY PERSONNEL WERE BEING EVACUATED BECAUSE OF EVENTS </p><p>IN EAST BEIRUT.  SUCH STATEMENTS, HE SAID, GIVE A FALSE </p><p>IMPRESSION OF THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND THE </p><p>OBJECTIVES OF THE MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WHILE HE SAID THE MOVEMENT FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>U.S. DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF "LA LEGALITE," HE </p><p>COULD NOT CONSIDER RECENT EVENTS A  "NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>TO THE CONTRARY, HE SAID, WHAT IS HAPPENING IS "VERY </p><p>HEALTHY FOR THE CHRISTIANS AND FOR THE WEST, STARTING </p><p>WITH THE U.S."  "WE HOPE," FARAH CONTINUED, "THAT </p><p>THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT CONTINUE TO TAKE FROM THE </p><p>VERY BEGINNING A HOSTILE POSITION TOWARDS THIS MOVEMENT, </p><p>A POSITION WHICH COULD JEOPARDIZE THE FUTURE OF OUR </p><p>RECIPROCAL RELATIONS."  "WE WANT TO ENSURE," HE SAID, </p><p>"THAT OUR RELATIONS ARE EXCELLENT WITH THE U.S., BECAUSE </p><p>WE CONSIDER THAT WE ARE FIGHTING THE SAME FIGHT, </p><p>CONFRONTING THE SAME ENEMY." </p><p> </p><p>5.  POLOFF RESPONDED THAT, AS FARAH WAS ALREADY AWARE </p><p>FROM THE DEPARTMENT\'S STATEMENT AND FROM CONVERSATIONS </p><p>EMBOFFS HAD ALREADY HAD WITH MEMBERS OF THE "CHRISTIAN </p><p>DECISION MOVEMENT," THE U.S. CONSIDERED THE EVENTS OF </p><p>THIS WEEK A NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THEY DIVIDED </p><p>THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY AND UNDERCUT THE PRESIDENT </p><p>PRECISELY WHEN THEY NEEDED TO BE STRONG AND UNITED </p><p>TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF POLITICAL REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>MOTIVES AND OBJECTIVES </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>6.  FARAH INTERRUPTED TO "ASSURE THE U.S. OFFICIALLY" </p><p>THAT THE MOVEMENT (A) WAS  NOT AN ATTEMPTED COUP D\'ETAT, </p><p>(B) WAS NOT DIRECTED AGAINST THE PRESIDENCY OR THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HIMSELF ("WE HAVE NOT ASKED HIM TO RESIGN."), </p><p>AND (C) IS AGAINST THE USE OF FORCE AND AGAINST BLOODSHED. </p><p>FARAH ADDED THAT THE MOVEMENT HAD CALLED FOR, SINCE </p><p>YESTERDAY, MARCH 14R THE REOPENING OF THE DOG RIVER </p><p>TUNNEL AND THE BRIDGES WHICH HAD BEEN BLOCKED BY THE </p><p>"FOLKS FROM THE METN," I.E., PHALANGE MILITIAMEN LOYAL </p><p>TO THE PRESIDENT.  FARAH CLAIMED THAT THESE LATTER </p><p>FORCES HAD TURNED OVER THESE CHOKE POINTS TO THE LAF </p><p>AND THAT WITHIN A FEW HOURS TRAFFIC COULD FLOW FREELY </p><p>AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AS FOR THE MOTIVES UNDERLYING THE "CHRISTIAN DECISION </p><p>MOVEMENT,"  FARAH SAID THAT FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS </p><p>PRESIDENT GEMAYEL HAS TRIED TO PLAY SIMULTANEOUSLY TWO </p><p>INCOMPATIBLE ROLES:  FIRST THAT OF PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>REPUBLIC, I.E., OF ALL LEBANESE REGARDLESS OF THEIR </p><p>CONFESSIONAL AFFILIATION, AND SECOND THAT OF LEADER OF </p><p>THE CHRISTIANS.   THESE TWO ROLES ARE INCOMPATIBLE, </p><p>FARAH EXPLAINED, BECAUSE, AS CHIEF OF STATE, GEMAYEL </p><p>IS OBLIGED TO MAKE CERTAIN CONCESSIONS THAT HE SHOULD NOT </p><p>MAKE AS LEADER OF THE CHRISTIANS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  FARAH CITED THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF THE MARCH 9-10 </p><p>BIKFAYYA TALKS WHERE GEMAYEL "FACED FOUR ENEMIES:  KHADDAM </p><p>KARAMI, BARRI, AND JUMBLATT," AND WHERE HE MADE CONCESSION </p><p>WHICH WERE UNACCEPTABLE FOR HIM TO MAKE AS THE CHRISTIAN </p><p>LEADER.  THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN, FARAH SAID, A SEPARATE </p><p>CHRISTIAN REPRESENTATIVE PRESENT SO THAT THE PRESIDENT </p><p>COULD HAVE PLAYED THE OVERARCHING ROLE OF CHIEF OF STATE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  FURTHERMORE, FARAH CLAIMED, GEMAYEL\'S PLAYING THESE </p><p>TWO INCOMPATIBLE ROLES HAS STYMIED THE DECISION-MAKING </p><p>PROCESS  WITHIN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  FOR SEVERAL </p><p>MONTHS, HE SAID, NO ONE IN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY HAS </p><p>DARED TO SPEAK THEIR MIND. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE "CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT," </p><p>FARAH STATED, IS TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION BY THE </p><p>FORMATION OF A COUNCIL COMPRISING REPRESENTATIVES FROM </p><p>ALL LEBANESE CHRISTIAN GROUPS, INCLUDING BOTH POLITICAL </p><p>AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS.  VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE </p><p>LEBANESE FORCES WOULD BE REPRESENTED ON THE COUNCIL. </p><p>THE ROLE OF THE COUNCIL WOULD NOT BE MERELY CONSULTATIVE, </p><p>FARAH STRESSED, BUT ALSO "DECISIONAL."  THE COUNCIL </p><p>WOULD FORMULATE CHRISTIAN POLICIES,AND A REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>SELECTED BY THE COUNCIL WOULD PARTICIPATE IN NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>WITH THE MUSLIMS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE CHIEF OF STATE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  FARAH THEN SET FORTH THREE STEPS WHICH GEMAYEL MUST </p><p>NOT/NOT TAKE:  (A) HE MUST NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE LAF </p><p>AGAINST THE MOVEMENT BOTH BECAUSE THE LAF WOULD NOT FOLLOW </p><p>HIS ORDERS AND BECAUSE THE LAF WOULD DISINTEGRATE AND </p><p>MUCH OF ITS EQUIPMENT WOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE </p><p>LF MILITIA. (FARAH CLAIMED THAT GEMAYEL HAD ACTUALLY </p><p>CALLED ON THE ARMY TO INTERVENE EARLY ON MARCH 13 BUT THAT </p><p>THE ARMY LEADERSHIP HAD REFUSED.)  (B) HE MUST NOT PUSH </p><p>THE PHALANGE PARTY TO USE WHAT REMAINS OF ITS METN-BASED </p><p>MILITIA AGAINST THE LF BECAUSE THE LF WILL EASILY CRUSH </p><p>THEM.  AND (C) HE MUST NOT EVEN THINK OF ASKING SYRIAN </p><p>FORCES TO INTERVENE, BECAUSE IF ONE SYRIAN SHELL STRIKES </p><p>THE CHRISTIAN REGION GEMAYEL WILL LOSE ALL CREDIBILITY AND </p><p>THE "CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT" WILL SIMPLY GAIN SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p>12.  AS A FOOTNOTE, FARAH ADDED THAT THE RECONCILIATION </p><p>COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY THE MARONITE PATRIARCH HAD ALREADY </p><p>MET SEVERAL TIMES WITH JA\'JA\' AND OTHER FIGURES IN </p><p>THE MOVEMENT (INCLUDING FARAH) AND THAT IT WAS CLEAR </p><p>THAT THE COMMITTEE FOUND THE MOVEMENT\'S MOTIVES TO BE </p><p>WELL-FOUNDED AND REASONABLE.  RECALLING WHAT POLOFF HAD </p><p>SAID (PARA. 5) ABOUT THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF DIVISIONS </p><p>WITHIN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY AT THIS TIME, FARAH SAID </p><p>THAT HE AND MANY OTHERS IN THE MOVEMENT HOPED THAT THE </p><p>ULTIMATE RESULT WOULD BE POSITIVE, I.E., A MORE UNIFIED </p><p>CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY, SURE OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT </p><p>IS HEADED, AND SOLIDLY BEHIND THE PRESIDENT.  HE CONCLUDED </p><p>BY ASKING FOR U.S. "UNDERSTANDING AND PATIENCE." </p><p> </p><p>13.  COMMENT.  FARAH WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO SET FORTH </p><p>CLEARLY THE MOTIVES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE "CHRISTIAN </p><p>DECISION MOVEMENT."  AWARE OF THE TOUGH REPUTATION (TO </p><p>SAY THE LEAST) OF THE MOVEMENT\'S LEADERS, HE EVIDENTLY </p><p>WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAD WIDE BACKING WITHIN </p><p>THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY , THAT THE MOVEMENT WAS PROCEEDING </p><p>RATIONALLY AND REASONABLY, AND THAT IT DESERVED U.S. UNDER- </p><p>STANDING IF NOT SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
