<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000584 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, YM, DEMARCHE </p><p>SUBJECT: CLOSURE OF IRAQI MISSIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 72921 </p><p>     B. STATE 75557 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Edmund J. Hull, Ambassador for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  DCM delivered reftel demarches to Chief of the </p><p>Americas Office Abdul-Salam Q. Al-Awadi on 3/24.  Awadi said </p><p>he would convey the U.S. message to FM Qirbi, but offered his </p><p>own "opinion" of the ROYG position.  He said that it would be </p><p>very difficult for Yemen to act against Iraq because of their </p><p>long-standing bilateral relations.  He further noted that for </p><p>countries like Jordan and Egypt this type of action would be </p><p>easier because they are closer to the U.S.  Awadi also </p><p>indicated that the ROYG was concerned about Yemeni students </p><p>still present in Iraq, noting that severance of diplomatic </p><p>contacts could restrict the ROYG\'s ability to assist them. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  DCM explained that our request pertained only to </p><p>the Iraqi government, its officials and its missions, and </p><p>that Yemen-Iraq people-to-people relations would obviously </p><p>continue.  Moreover, the impending removal of the Iraqi </p><p>regime would compel the ROYG to address the question of how </p><p>to deal with representatives from Saddam\'s government.  Still </p><p>hesitant, Awadi stated that it would be very difficult to </p><p>change the ROYG position, especially in light of Yemeni </p><p>support for the Iraqi people. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  Also in attendance were DATT and </p><p>Pol/EconOff(notetaker). </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
