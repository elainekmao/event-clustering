<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 SANTIAGO 000263 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, UNSC, CI </p><p>SUBJECT: BIO FOR JUAN GABRIEL VALDES, CHILE\'S PERMREP TO </p><p>THE UN </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 SANTIAGO 3279 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: E/POL COUNSELOR BRIAN BLOOD, REASONS 1.5 B AND D </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: JUAN GABRIEL VALDES IS THE GOC\'S PERMANENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UN AS CHILE BEGINS ITS TWO-YEAR TOUR ON </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL.  HE PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS CHILE\'S </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER AND IN A PAIR OF TRADE POLICY POSITIONS. </p><p>VALDES LIVED AND WORKED IN THE U.S. FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING </p><p>THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT, DURING WHICH TIME HE NARROWLY </p><p>ESCAPED THE CAR BOMBING THAT CLAIMED THE LIFE OF ORLANDO </p><p>LETELIER.  VALDES HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH PRESIDENT RICARDO </p><p>LAGOS FOR MANY YEARS AND WILL HAVE ACCESS AT THE HIGHEST </p><p>LEVELS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) JUAN GABRIEL VALDES SOUBLETTE HAS BEEN CHILE\'S </p><p>PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UNITED NATIONS SINCE MAY </p><p>2000, SHORTLY AFTER THE START OF PRESIDENT RICARDO LAGOS\' </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  CHILE\'S ACCESSION TO THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>ON 1 JANUARY 2003 WILL RAISE VALDES\' PROFILE IN NEW YORK AND </p><p>IN CHILE.  A BRIEF BIO FOLLOWS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER: PINOCHET AND SEATTLE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) JUAN GABRIEL VALDES SERVED AS CHILE\'S FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER FROM JUNE 1999 UNTIL MARCH 2000 AT THE END OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION OF FAMILY FRIEND EDUARDO FREI </p><p>RUIZ-TAGLE.  VALDES IS THE SON OF GABRIEL VALDES </p><p>SUBERCASEAUX, CURRENTLY THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE\'S FOREIGN </p><p>RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND FORMERLY THE FOREIGN MINISTER FOR </p><p>FREI\'S FATHER, EDUARDO FREI MONTALVA, FROM 1964 TO 1970.  THE </p><p>YOUNGER VALDES IS A MEMBER OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY, WHILE HIS </p><p>FATHER IS A CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) ONE OF VALDES\' FIRST CHALLENGES WHEN HE TOOK OVER AS </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER WAS MANAGING THE INTERNATIONAL CONTROVERSY </p><p>SURROUNDING GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET, WHO WAS BEING HELD IN </p><p>LONDON FACING POSSIBLE EXTRADITION TO SPAIN.  PRESIDENT FREI </p><p>CHOSE VALDES IN PART BECAUSE OF THE TIME VALDES SPENT AS </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN FROM 1990 TO 1994.  VALDES ADVOCATED FOR </p><p>PINOCHET\'S RETURN TO CHILE BOTH ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS AND </p><p>SO HE COULD FACE CHILEAN JUSTICE INSTEAD OF SPANISH. </p><p>PINOCHET WAS RETURNED TO CHILE IN MARCH 2000, NEAR THE END OF </p><p>VALDES\' TIME AS FOREIGN MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN DECEMBER 1999, VALDES LED THE CHILEAN DELEGATION </p><p>TO THE WTO MINISTERIAL IN SEATTLE.  VALDES, TRAVELING IN A </p><p>VEHICLE PROVIDED BY THE WASHINGTON STATE GOVERNOR\'S OFFICE </p><p>AND ACCOMPANIED BY THE CHILEAN AMBASSADORS TO THE U.S. AND </p><p>THE WTO, WAS TWICE STOPPED BY POLICE AND TOLD THE VEHICLE </p><p>COULD NOT APPROACH THE CONVENTION/HOTEL AREA.  VALDES AND HIS </p><p>PARTY LEFT THE VEHICLE, OPTING TO WALK IN THE RAIN AND WITH </p><p>BAGGAGE IN HAND THE SEVERAL BLOCKS TO THEIR HOTEL.  THE PARTY </p><p>WAS STOPPED TWO MORE TIMES BY POLICE AND TOLD IT COULD NOT </p><p>PROCEED.  AFTER BEING STOPPED FOR THE FOURTH TIME, VALDES AND </p><p>A SEATTLE POLICE OFFICER EXCHANGED CAREFULLY-CHOSEN WORDS, </p><p>AND THE OFFICER ALLEGEDLY SHOVED THE FOREIGN MINISTER. </p><p>CHILE\'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. FOUND ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER, </p><p>WHO ESCORTED THE PARTY ON FOOT TO ITS HOTEL.  VALDES\' INITIAL </p><p>REACTION WAS TO LEAVE SEATTLE AT ONCE AND RETURN HOME.  UPON </p><p>REFLECTION AND AFTER APOLOGETIC CALLS FROM THEN UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE THOMAS PICKERING AND A NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL OFFICIAL, VALDES REMAINED FOR THE MINISTERIAL. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>A PAIR OF TRADE POSITIONS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE FREI ADMINISTRATION, </p><p>VALDES WAS A PRIMARY PLAYER IN CHILE\'S TRADE POLICY EFFORTS. </p><p>FROM 1994 UNTIL 1996, HE WAS HEAD OF THE FINANCE MINISTRY\'S </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DIRECTORATE.  HE HELD THE UNOFFICIAL </p><p>TITLE OF CHIEF NAFTA NEGOTIATOR, AND PURSUED CHILE\'S </p><p>ULTIMATELY POSTPONED EFFORT TO REACH A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH THE U.S. AFTER THE DECEMBER 1994 SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS </p><p>IN MIAMI.  VALDES WAS PART OF A LARGER POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN </p><p>THE FINANCE MINISTRY AND THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OVER </p><p>WHICH MINISTRY WOULD TAKE THE LEAD IN TRADE TALKS.  IN PART </p><p>BECAUSE OF THIS INTER-MINISTERIAL RIVALRY, MFA OFFICIALS </p><p>CRITICIZED VALDES AT THE TIME FOR HIS LACK OF EXPERTISE IN </p><p>ECONOMIC AND TRADE MATTERS, AND CHARACTERIZED HIM AS A </p><p>LIGHTWEIGHT WHOSE INFLUENTIAL FATHER HAD GOTTEN HIM HIS </p><p>POSITION.  VALDES HAD WANTED TO BE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. OR </p><p>DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER AFTER HIS TOUR AS AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>SPAIN, AND TOOK THE FINANCE MINISTRY POSITION AS SOMETHING OF </p><p>A CONSOLATION PRIZE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\' POSITION CHANGED IN </p><p>1996 WHEN VALDES TOOK OVER THE MFA\'S DIRECTORATE FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS (DIRECON) AND BROUGHT THE </p><p>TRADE PORTFOLIO WITH HIM.  TRADE POLICY PRIMACY HAS REMAINED </p><p>WITH THE MFA EVER SINCE.  VALDES MANAGED THE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>WHICH PRODUCED FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH CANADA, MEXICO AND </p><p>PERU, AND LAUNCHED TALKS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SOUTH </p><p>KOREA WHICH WOULD REACH FRUITION IN 2002.  VALDES SOUGHT TO </p><p>DEEPEN CHILE\'S ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH THE REGION AND THE </p><p>WORLD, AND FOUGHT AGAINST A SINGLE-MINDED FOCUS ON THE U.S. </p><p>THE AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HONORED HIM IN JUNE 1999 </p><p>WITH ITS "PROMOTING FREE TRADE" AWARD.  VALDES LEFT DIRECON </p><p>IN JUNE 1999 TO JOIN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF RICARDO </p><p>LAGOS, ALTHOUGH FREI CALLED HIM BACK INTO GOVERNMENT SEVERAL </p><p>WEEKS LATER TO BE FOREIGN MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>FROM EXILE WITH LETELIER TO THE "NO" VOTE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) VALDES STAYED OUTSIDE OF CHILE FOR MOST OF THE </p><p>MILTARY GOVERNMENT PERIOD.  HE RECEIVED A MASTERS IN </p><p>POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES FROM THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX IN 1973, AND A PH.D. IN POLITICAL SCIENCE </p><p>FROM PRINCETON IN 1976. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) FROM PRINCETON VALDES WENT TO WORK AT THE INSTITUTE </p><p>FOR POLICY STUDIES IN WASHINGTON WITH ORLANDO LETELIER, </p><p>CHILE\'S EXILED FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.  VALDES </p><p>TYPICALLY RODE TO WORK WITH HIS COUNTRYMAN LETELIER, BUT HE </p><p>STAYED HOME ON 21 SEPTEMBER 1976 TO WATCH HIS CHILDREN WHILE </p><p>HIS WIFE WENT TO THE SUPERMARKET.  LETELIER AND HIS </p><p>ASSISTANT, AMCIT RONNI MOFFITT, WERE KILLED BY A CAR BOMB </p><p>THAT MORNING OFF SHERIDAN CIRCLE.  VALDES HAD RIDDEN IN </p><p>LETELIER\'S CAR THE NIGHT BEFORE AFTER THE BOMB HAD ALREADY </p><p>BEEN PLANTED BY AGENTS OF CHILE\'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. </p><p>(COMMENT: SOME OF VALDES\' COLLEAGUES FROM THIS TIME WERE VERY </p><p>CRITICAL OF HIS EFFORTS AS FOREIGN MINISTER TO HELP PINOCHET </p><p>AVOID EXTRADITION TO SPAIN.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) VALDES WORKED AT A VARIETY OF THINK TANKS AND </p><p>UNIVERSITIES IN MEXICO, THE U.S. AND CHILE OVER THE NEXT TEN </p><p>YEARS, INCLUDING AT NOTRE DAME AND PRINCETON AS A VISITING </p><p>SCHOLAR.  HE WAS ACTIVE DURING THE 1988 PLEBESCITE ON </p><p>CONTINUED PINOCHET RULE, IN PARTICULAR HELPING TO ORGANIZE </p><p>THE TELEVISION SPOTS FOR THE "NO" CAMPAIGN.  VALDES WORKED </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THE STAFF OF CURRENT PRESIDENT RICARDO LAGOS </p><p>DURING AND AFTER THE PLEBESCITE CAMPAIGN, AND LAGOS\' </p><p>INFLUENCE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN WINNING VALDES THE COVETED </p><p>AMBASSADORSHIP TO SPAIN IN 1990.  VALDES HAS PUBLISHED </p><p>NUMEROUS ARTICLES AND A BOOK, "PINOCHET\'S ECONOMISTS: THE </p><p>CHICAGO SCHOOL IN CHILE," WHICH THE CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY </p><p>PRESS PUT OUT IN 1996. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>URBANE AND SOPHISTICATED </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) VALDES HAS RUN IN INTERNATIONAL CIRCLES FOR NEARLY </p><p>HIS ENTIRE LIFE.  DURING HIS FATHER\'S TIME AS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER, VALDES MET GOLDA MEIR, ROBERT KENNEDY AND CHARLES </p><p>DE GAULLE, AMONG OTHER PROMINENT FIGURES.  HE LOBBIED EDWARD </p><p>KENNEDY AFTER THE LETELIER BOMBING, AND MET CARLOS SALINAS </p><p>WHILE WORKING IN MEXICO.  NUMEROUS FRIENDS AND PROFESSORS </p><p>FROM HIS COLLEGE YEARS WOULD GO ON TO BE GOVERNMENT </p><p>MINISTERS, INCLUDING CURRENT INTERIOR MINISTER JOSE MIGUEL </p><p>INSULZA. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) VALDES HAS LIVED AND TRAVELLED ALL AROUND THE WORLD, </p><p>JOKING THAT HE HAS ACQUIRED A "PH.D. IN HOTELS."  HE HAS A </p><p>REPUTATION AS A BON VIVANT, AND STATES THAT HIS FAVORITE </p><p>WORLD CITY IS PARIS.  HE STUDIED THE CELLO FOR YEARS, AND </p><p>ENJOYS JAZZ AND CLASSICAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY MAHLER\'S FIFTH </p><p>SYMPHONY.  OTHER FAVORITES ARE VICTOR HUGO\'S LES MISERABLES </p><p>AND AUDREY HEPBURN.  VALDES IS WITTY WHEN RELAXED AND A GOOD </p><p>RACONTEUR. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) VALDES WAS BORN IN SANTIAGO IN JUNE 1947.  HE </p><p>STUDIED LAW AT THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF CHILE.  HE IS </p><p>MARRIED TO THE HISTORIAN ANTONIA ECHENIQUE CELIS.  THEY HAVE </p><p>FOUR CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT: DIRECT LINE TO PRESIDENT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) VALDES HAS A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER ALVEAR, BUT THERE ARE ALSO FACTORS WHICH LIMIT THE </p><p>FRIENDLINESS BETWEEN THEM.  ALVEAR AND SENATOR VALDES (THE </p><p>PERM REP\'S FATHER) ARE BOTH CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS, BUT THEY </p><p>COME FROM DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF THE PARTY.  SEN. VALDES HAS </p><p>BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF ALVEAR\'S MANAGEMENT OF THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY, PARTICULARLY THE MISHANDLING OF CHILE\'S </p><p>RATIFICATION OF THE TREATY SETTING UP THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CRIMINAL COURT (WHICH HAS STILL NOT BEEN RATIFIED).  ALVEAR </p><p>WAS NOT PART OF CHILE\'S FOREIGN POLICY ESTABLISHMENT PRIOR TO </p><p>BEING NAMED FOREIGN MINISTER, AND SHE OWES HER POSITION TO </p><p>THE CRUCIAL HELP SHE GAVE PRESIDENT LAGOS IN THE RAZOR CLOSE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL RUNOFF HE WON IN 2000.  LAGOS GAVE HER HER </p><p>CHOICE OF MINISTRIES, AND SHE SELECTED THE MFA.  PERM REP </p><p>VALDES WAS THE SITTING MINISTER AT THE TIME AND THERE WAS </p><p>SOME SPECULATION THAT HE WOULD STAY ON, ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT </p><p>THE LEADING CANDIDATE.  IN SOME SENSE, VALDES (AND HIS </p><p>FATHER) MAY VIEW THE TOP JOB AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AS </p><p>RIGHTFULLY HIS.  ALVEAR BROUGHT HER OWN TEAM TO THE MFA TO </p><p>SERVE AS HER INNER CIRCLE OF ADVISORS, WHICH EXACERBATED THE </p><p>DISTANCE BETWEEN HERSELF AND MORE ESTABLISHED FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>FIGURES LIKE VALDES. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) VALDES\' RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT LAGOS DATES BACK </p><p>MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS, SPANNING THE 1988 PLEBESCITE, LAGOS\' </p><p>1999 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, AND VALDES\' FIRST TWO YEARS AS </p><p>PERM REP.  VALDES BROUGHT THE PRESIDENT\'S SON, RICARDO LAGOS </p><p>WEBER, ONTO HIS NAFTA NEGOTIATING TEAM AT THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTRY IN 1994, AND TOOK LAGOS WEBER WITH HIM WHEN HE MOVED </p><p>TO DIRECON.  VALDES TOLD AMBASSADOR BROWNFIELD (REFTEL) THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT LAGOS IS CLOSELY TRACKING UNSC ISSUES WITH HIM </p><p>PERSONALLY.  WHILE VALDES DOES NOT HOLD CABINET RANK, HE WILL </p><p>BE ABLE TO RELY UPON THIS DIRECT LINE TO THE PRESIDENT FOR </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL MATTERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOLDBERG </p><p></p></div>
