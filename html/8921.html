<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004016 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PM (DAS MAGGI) AND EUR/SE; DSCA FOR LT. GEN. WALTERS </p><p>AND LTCOL BUCHHOLZ; DTSA FOR S. SEVIER; SAF/IA FOR W. </p><p>MITCHELL; OSD FOR DUSD BRONSON; DTSA FOR S. SEVIER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, TU, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY, BAE SYSTEMS AND SPEWS II:  FURTHER DELAY </p><p>IN USG POSITION ON MLA RISKS LOSING DEAL ALTOGETHER </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BAE Systems and the Turkish government have been </p><p>trying to secure an amendment to an existing Manufacturing </p><p>License Agreement (MLA) that re-hosts Turkish software and </p><p>jamming routines on the new SPEWS II hardware since early </p><p>2003.  Turkey\'s F-16 defensive system is based on the SPEWS </p><p>"type" of program.  We understand the MLA amendment is </p><p>currently with DOD and that while a number of offices there </p><p>support the amendment, the US Air Force appears to have </p><p>reservations.  The Turks have agreed to extend their contract </p><p>with BAE until July 15 in the hope the USG will approve the </p><p>amendment to the MLA.  If the MLA amendment is not approved </p><p>by July 15, the Turks have indicated they may cancel the </p><p>program and reactivate negotiations with the French or the </p><p>Israelis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We recognize possible concerns regarding release of </p><p>sensitive technology to NATO Allies including Turkey.  We </p><p>understand the proposed MLA amendment covers technology </p><p>similar to that released to Turkey for earlier versions of </p><p>the F-16 with the SPEWS I program in 1997.  The Country Team </p><p>is not aware of any information that suggests that Turkey has </p><p>not followed through on its commitments to safeguard and </p><p>protect the technology it received under SPEWS I.  Turkey has </p><p>a strong track record of safeguarding US technology. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) If a positive decision is not reached by July 15 or if </p><p>the USG disapproves the MLA amendment, there could be </p><p>negative repercussions and this would be a setback for </p><p>efforts to put the US-Turkish bilateral relationship back on </p><p>track.  In the aftermath of OIF, we have been suggesting </p><p>Turkey define its cooperation with the US to give renewed </p><p>confidence to our work together.  Refusing to release </p><p>technology that we would make available to other NATO Allies </p><p>would raise concerns and questions about our sincerity. </p><p>There are also sound business and policy reasons to approve </p><p>the MLA amendment, including support for US defense industry </p><p>in an important market and increased interoperability between </p><p>Turkish and US systems.  Turkey,s 58 Block 50 F-16 aircraft </p><p>do not have any electronic warfare capability, severely </p><p>inhibiting their ability to support NATO and US-Turkey </p><p>bilateral operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Action request:  The Embassy and ODC request that DOD </p><p>agencies work to reach a consensus position in support of the </p><p>MLA amendment and forward the MLA amendment to the State </p><p>Department for final approval before the contract between BAE </p><p>and the GOT expires on July 15.  If DOD is leaning toward </p><p>opposing the MLA amendment, before Washington reaches a final </p><p>inter-agency position, we suggest that Washington consider </p><p>having SAF/IA and the Turkish Air Force meet in person to </p><p>give SAF/IA an opportunity to explain to the Turks its </p><p>concerns and give the Turks the same opportunity to assuage </p><p>SAF/IA,s concerns. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
