(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) This cable contains an action request, please </p><p>see paragraph 7. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY: Polchief -- after securing agreement </p><p>from the organizers that she would be in listening </p><p>mode only -- accepted an invitation to a 4/10 to a </p><p>gathering of Iraqi expatriates in the UAE organized </p><p>by Dr. Bashir Al-Samarrai (with whom Special </p><p>Presidential Envoy Dr. Khalilzad had met during his </p><p>February visit to the UAE, see reftel).  Over 100 </p><p>expats, most of them professionals, representing </p><p>Iraq\'s ethnic and religious mosaic attended the </p><p>private function held in a local hotel\'s conference </p><p>room.  They presented an 11-point paper which they </p><p>asked Polchief to convey at the earliest possible </p><p>opportunity to the USG.  The event proved to be a </p><p>forum both for an emotional outpouring of anti- </p><p>regime sentiment, as well as the expression of </p><p>continued deep concern about Iraq\'s immediate </p><p>humanitarian needs.  Any jubilation over the </p><p>regime\'s demise had already been replaced by deep </p><p>anxiety over the scenes of chaos relayed by the </p><p>world\'s press (no doubt fueled by concern about the </p><p>fate of relatives still in Iraq). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED:  Among those present was </p><p>the "Syed" (religious leader) of the powerful </p><p>Samarrai clan, who had left Iraq only two weeks ago. </p><p>He spoke eloquently about the need to respect the </p><p>religious, cultural and social customs of the people </p><p>of Iraq.  Polchief learned from another attendee </p><p>that the head of the Al-Shammar tribe (Iraq\'s </p><p>largest tribe) is also visiting the UAE and was </p><p>warning that the tribe would not accept humiliating </p><p>treatment of its members by coalition forces, i.e. </p><p>the hooding of prisoners.  From those Iraqi expats </p><p>who had managed to escape the regime much earlier, </p><p>the recent scenes of chaos and destruction back home </p><p>appeared to engender a strong desire to return </p><p>and/or assist with reconstruction as quickly as </p><p>possible -- perhaps resulting in part from what </p><p>appeared to be almost a sense of guilt that they had </p><p>escaped the worst of the regime and its death-throes </p><p>while so many Iraqis had not.  These feelings led to </p><p>many questions about the precise mechanism for expat </p><p>Iraqis to return to serve their country.  We are </p><p>sure other posts are being similarly queried and </p><p>would appreciate guidance on how we may respond. </p><p>Based on the strong representations of the expat </p><p>community here, it would appear that many in the </p><p>Iraqi diaspora are eager to make a positive </p><p>contribution -- one we should welcome.  The group </p><p>agreed to form sub-committees and requested further </p><p>meetings with the Embassy.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>FREE FROM THE WATCHFUL EYES OF THE MUKHABARAT, AN </p><p>IMPROMPTU GATHERING DRAWS A LARGE CROWD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Approximately 100 members of the large Iraqi </p><p>expatriate gathered on April 10 to voice their </p><p>concerns about the future of Iraq.  Dr. Bashir Al- </p><p>Samarrai, who met with Special Presidential Envoy </p><p>Khalilzad in February in the UAE, addressed the </p><p>group, carefully noting that those gathered did not </p><p>represent any political party.  At the outset, Al- </p><p>Samarrai commented that the meeting was </p><p>extraordinary because, for the first time in thirty </p><p>years, Iraqis were able to gather without the fear </p><p>that their remarks would make it back to the regime. </p><p>They were grateful to the U.S. and the coalition but </p><p>expressed great anxiety about the road ahead.  Al- </p><p>Samarrai read from an 11-point paper addressed to </p><p>the USG, titled "Iraq for All Iraqis and Equality </p><p>under the Law," the full text of which is contained </p><p>in the last paragraph of this cable.  Following Al- </p><p>Samarrai\'s presentation, the floor was opened to </p><p>comments in what evolved into a lively give-and-take </p><p>during which those who have for too long muted their </p><p>voices spoke out freely about their homeland. </p><p>Highlights of both the formal presentation and the </p><p>informal give-and-take were: </p><p> </p><p>-- The coalition must take immediate steps to stop </p><p>the looting, burning and, in particular, trashing of </p><p>the hospitals in Iraq.  It is very disconcerting to </p><p>see coalition troops standing by while buildings are </p><p>being looted. </p><p> </p><p>-- We must take immediate steps to get supplies, </p><p>equipment and doctors into the hospitals.  There are </p><p>no medicines, no anesthesia. </p><p> </p><p>-- The destruction of ministries and government </p><p>buildings is wiping away evidence of the regime\'s </p><p>crimes.  We must protect the documents with which we </p><p>can bring those who have committed crimes to </p><p>justice. </p><p> </p><p>-- The sanctions must be lifted as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>-- Travel restrictions must be lifted.  Iraqi </p><p>expatriates must be allowed to return to see their </p><p>families and help in the rebuilding of their </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>-- Economic sanctions should be lifted. </p><p> </p><p>-- War reparations and debts should be forgiven. </p><p> </p><p>-- The frozen assets of the regime should be turned </p><p>over to a freely elected government, not to </p><p>opposition political leaders. </p><p> </p><p>-- Above all, Iraqi\'s territorial integrity must be </p><p>respected as must the country traditions, religions </p><p>and socio-cultural institutions. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>FORMAL LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Beginning of text: </p><p> </p><p>We are Iraqis from all walks of life and different </p><p>sectors of Iraqi society:  Arabs, Kurds, Turkomans, </p><p>Muslims (Sunnis and Shi\'as), Christians and others. </p><p>We were and are opposed to the dictatorial regime of </p><p>Saddam Hussein and look forward to the day of his </p><p>downfall. </p><p> </p><p>We are gathered here at this critical moment in </p><p>Iraq\'s history to share our thoughts and to express </p><p>our common desire and wish to convey a message to </p><p>the U.S. Government through our guest, Ms. Stephanie </p><p>Williams (the Head of the Political Section at the </p><p>U.S. Embassy in the UAE).  We are all united in the </p><p>hope for the U.S. and the international community to </p><p>honor its pledge to Iraq\'s people by easing the </p><p>hardships and suffering of the people of Iraq by </p><p>taking the following steps: </p><p> </p><p>A) The immediate end to the UN economic sanctions </p><p>imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War. </p><p> </p><p>B) Waive the war reparations imposed on Iraq as a </p><p>result of the Gulf War. </p><p> </p><p>C) Forgive all debts. </p><p> </p><p>D) We urge the U.S. Government and members of the </p><p>International Community to protect all of Iraq\'s </p><p>assets by temporarily freezing these assets, pending </p><p>handover to a future legitimate Iraqi Government. </p><p>(Note:  Al-Samarrai added that these assets should </p><p>not be given to some unnamed opposition figures who </p><p>have been asking for them.) </p><p> </p><p>E) We would like to express our opposition to the </p><p>appointment of discredited leaders who lack </p><p>credibility and legitimacy and wish to make it very </p><p>clear that legitimacy is derived from the Iraqi </p><p>people, not by an outside power. </p><p> </p><p>F) Iraq\'s oil belongs to the Iraqi people and no one </p><p>should have the right to decide its future, and </p><p>concession rights but the newly elected Government </p><p>of Iraq.  (Note:  Al-Samarrai commented that unnamed </p><p>Iraqi expats were contacting oil companies seeking </p><p>to negotiate contracts.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>G) We demand the immediate abolishment of all </p><p>institutions that have been used to oppress the </p><p>people of Iraq such as the Mukhbarat (Iraqi </p><p>Intelligence Service), the secret police and the </p><p>Aman Al-Khaas (special security) and the trial of </p><p>all those who have been responsible for committing </p><p>crimes. </p><p> </p><p>H) We demand the reorganization of the armed forces </p><p>in order to purge it from all elements that have </p><p>contributed to Saddam\'s crimes and the armed forces </p><p>must be subordinate to the people through its </p><p>elected government and must serve the Iraqi </p><p>constitution. </p><p> </p><p>I) We call upon the U.S. and the British forces to </p><p>show respect and sensitivity towards the people of </p><p>Iraq and their religious, cultural and social </p><p>customs. </p><p> </p><p>J) We aspire that a semblance of normality return as </p><p>soon as possible.  This is to ensure that the </p><p>disruptions caused by the war on the educational and </p><p>health establishments, and other institutions that </p><p>serve the nation are minimized and adequate </p><p>resources are directed to these institutions to </p><p>bolster their effectiveness. </p><p> </p><p>K) We demand that all travel restrictions to our </p><p>beloved country are lifted as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>We declare our "Commitment to Democracy" and the </p><p>rule of law. </p><p> </p><p>The new democratic system in Iraq must be based on </p><p>the respect for human rights, separation of powers </p><p>(executive, legislative, judicial) and the </p><p>separation of religion from the state. </p><p> </p><p>END OF TEXT </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Post requests guidance on how to direct </p><p>those Iraqis interested in returning to Iraq, when </p><p>conditions permit, to serve in the Interim Authority </p><p>or future governing body or simply to take up their </p><p>lives there.  Will there, for instance, be a </p><p>screening mechanisms, entry permits, etc.?  We also </p><p>request guidance on how to respond to requests from </p><p>this group for future meetings with Embassy </p><p>personnel. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
