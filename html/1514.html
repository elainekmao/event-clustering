HARARE 612, B. HARARE 573, C. 00 HARARE 3680 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\' AFFAIRES EARL M. IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>WHAT PRICE A PRO-ZANU-PF UNION LEADERSHIP? </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON FEBRUARY 1, CHARGE, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF AND </p><p>LABOFF, MET WITH BRIAN RAFTOPOULOS (PROTECT), A RESEARCH </p><p>FELLOW IN THE INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES AT THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE, AND AN INSIGHTFUL CONTACT </p><p>REGARDING THE LOCAL POLITICAL SCENE.  RAFTOPOULOS TOLD </p><p>US THAT HE HAS NO DOUBTS THAT ZANU-PF IS TRYING TO BUY </p><p>THE ELECTION OF A MORE FRIENDLY LEADERSHIP AT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS (ZCTU), IN ORDER TO </p><p>NEUTRALIZE LABOR AS A RICH SOURCE OF ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC). </p><p>HE HAS HEARD FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE ZANU-PF/GOZ HAS PAID </p><p>THE ARREARAGES OF TEN UNIONS AFFILIATED WITH THE ZCTU, </p><p>WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE UPCOMING </p><p>CONGRESS FEBRUARY 23-25 IN MASVINGO AND GIVES THEM </p><p>VOTING PRIVILEGES.  THE FEBRUARY 1-7 EDITION OF THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT "FINANCIAL GAZETTE" DESCRIBED A ZANU-PF/GOZ </p><p>PLOT TO RIG THE UPCOMING CONGRESS ELECTIONS, INCLUDING </p><p>THE EXISTENCE OF A SLUSH FUND TO BE USED TOWARDS THIS </p><p>END AND CONTROLLED BY THE GOZ CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00661  01 OF 02  071508Z </p><p>ORGANIZATION (CIO). (NOTE: PER REFTELS THE ACTING </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ZCTU, ISIDORE ZINDOGA, IS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE PRO-ZANU-PF, AND IF ELECTED AS SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL, WOULD SEEK TO SEVER THE STRONG TIES BETWEEN THE </p><p>ZCTU AND THE MDC.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>WHY NOT JUST MANHANDLE THE ZCTU? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) RAFTOPOULOS ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE RULING PARTY </p><p>WILL SEND WAR VETERANS TO DEMONSTRATE OUTSIDE THE </p><p>CONGRESS VENUE IN MASVINGO, BUT THAT THE PARTY WILL NOT TRY </p><p>HEAVY-HANDED INTIMIDATION TACTICS LIKE THOSE USED IN THE </p><p>RECENT PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTIONS.  THE UNION MEMBERSHIP </p><p>OF THE ZCTU WOULD NOT BE INTIMIDATED BY THESE TACTICS, </p><p>HE ADDED, AND THEY WOULD LIKELY BACKFIRE AND LEAD TO THE </p><p>ELECTION OF PRO-MDC LEADERS.  RAFTOPOULOS EXPECTS THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF WILL STEP UP EFFORTS TO BRIBE INDIVIDUAL UNION </p><p>LEADERS AS THE CONGRESS APPROACHES, AS WELL AS RUN </p><p>STORIES IN THE MEDIA ON HOW THE MDC IS TRYING TO CONTROL </p><p>THE ZCTU FOR ITS OWN SELFISH AND NEFARIOUS PURPOSES. </p><p>THE JANUARY 31 EDITION OF THE GOZ-CONTROLLED "THE </p><p>HERALD" RAN A FEATURE STORY ENTITLED "ZCTU: TRADE </p><p>UNIONISM RISKS BEING SACRIFICED ON THE PEDESTAL OF </p><p>POLITICAL GREED."  THE STORY CLAIMED THAT THE TRADE </p><p>UNION MOVEMENT WOULD SUFFER IF ITS MEMBERSHIP ALLOWS IT </p><p>TO BE AFFILIATED WITH THE MDC. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>CONGRESS OUTCOME IS CRITICAL TO THE MDC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00661  01 OF 02  071508Z </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) RAFTOPOULOS MADE CLEAR THAT THE MDC\'S FUTURE </p><p>SUCCESS AS A POLITICAL PARTY DEPENDS ON CONTINUED </p><p>SUPPORT FROM THE ZCTU.  ANY ATTEMPT AT MASS ACTION BY </p><p>THE MDC REQUIRES THE SUPPORT AND ORGANIZING RESOURCES OF </p><p>THE ZCTU.  SIMILARLY, RAFTOPOULOS BELIEVES THAT THE MDC </p><p>WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RUN AN EFFECTIVE NATIONWIDE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN 2002 WITHOUT THE ZCTU.  IT IS </p><p>FOR THIS REASON, HE ADDED, THAT ZANU-PF IS MAKING A </p><p>CONCERTED EFFORT TO BREAK THE TIES BETWEEN THE MDC AND </p><p>THE ZCTU. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: GIVEN THE HISTORY OF ZANU-PF, WE HAVE </p><p>LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE RULING PARTY IS ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>MANIPULATE AND/OR BUY THE ELECTION OF A SYMPATHETIC ZCTU </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  SEPARATING THE MDC FROM ITS TRADE UNION </p><p>BASE IS A CENTRAL ELEMENT OF ZANU-PF\'S "URBAN STRATEGY" </p><p>FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  THE MDC IS TAKING </p><p>THIS CHALLENGE VERY SERIOUSLY, AND IS ORGANIZING ITS OWN </p><p>SUPPORTERS WITHIN THE UNIONS TO COUNTER THE ATTACK.  THE </p><p>OUTCOME OF THIS STRUGGLE WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER THE PRO- </p><p>MDC UNION LEADERS PRESENT A SINGLE SLATE OF CANDIDATES </p><p>FOR THE ZCTU LEADERSHIP, AS WELL AS HOW EFFECTIVE THE </p><p>RULING PARTY IS AT BUYING THE VOTES OF UNION LEADERS. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1076 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00661  02 OF 02  071508Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------C23F51  071508Z /38 </p><p>R 071507Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8184 </p><p>INFO DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000661 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ILAB FOR RSHEPHARD </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 02/07/11 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00661  02 OF 02  071508Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF SEEKS TO NEUTRALIZE LABOR SUPPORT FOR </p><p>MDC </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
