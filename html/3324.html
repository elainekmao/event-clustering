PRESIDENT BUSH IS REPORTED AS HAVING </p><p>CONDEMNED THE OPERATION AND WHITEHOUSE SPOKESMAN ARI </p><p>FLEISCHER IS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT THIS ATTACK </p><p>UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF FOCUSING ON PEACE. WITHIN </p><p>THAT SAME LEAD STORY, THE DAILIES REPORT THAT THE </p><p>QUADRIPARTITE COMMITTEE IS DIVIDED OVER THE U.S. STAND </p><p>ON ARAFAT. ANOTHER FRONTPAGE REPORT SAYS THAT </p><p>U.S.DEFENSE SECRTARY RUMSFELD HAS ORDERED AN UPDATE OF </p><p>ALL U.S. CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR A POSSIBLE  WAR AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ.

THE AMERICANS\' SUCCESS IN </p><p>BRINGING ZAHER SHAH, WHO DOES NOT RULE NOW, BACK TO </p><p>KABUL AMD PUTTING HAMID KARZAI AS A TEMPORARY PRESIDENT </p><p>AND THEN ELECTED BY THE LOUGERGA WILL BE THE MODEL </p><p>FOLLOWED BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION IN THE YEARS TO </p><p>COME UNTIL THIS MODEL FAILS A DISMAL FAILURE OR THE </p><p>UNITED STATES SUFFERS GREATER HARM FROM IT." </p><p> </p><p>MAKING IT A POINT THAT IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THE </p><p>UNITED STATES IS IMPLEMENTING THE AFGHANI MODEL IN </p><p>PALESTINE, IT IS ALSO IMPLEMENTING IT IN IRAQ, HAWAMDAH </p><p>CONCLUDES: "THE UNITED STATES WANTS, BY ALL MEANS, TO </p><p>AFGHANIZE IRAQ IN SUCH A BLIND MANNER AS IF IT IS </p><p>MEDICAL PERSCRIPTION OF A RECIPE. HOWEVER, PALESTINE </p><p>AND IRAQ ARE DIFFERENT. THE U.S. LOGIC DOES NOT KNOW </p><p>THE GAME OF DIFFERENCES. IT WANTS TO IMPLEMENT WHAT IT </p><p>THINKS IS SUCCESSFUL IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD. IT MIGHT </p><p>EVEN GENERALIZE SUCH A MODEL AND IMPLEMENT IT IN </p><p>EUROPEAN, AMERICAN, AND ASIAN COUNTRIES, WHICH WILL </p><p>BRING BACK THE HANDS OF TIME WITHOUT TAKING INTO </p><p>CONSIDERATION THE OPINION OF THE WORLD AND THE PEOPLES, </p><p>WHOM THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO HELP." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A FALSE U.S. PRETEXT TO TOPPLE SADDAM !!" </p><p> </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST IBRAHIM ABSI WRITES ON THE OP-ED PAGE </p><p>OF CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY </p><p>AL-DUSTOUR (07/17): "THE UNITED STATES IS PREPARING ALL </p><p>ITS INTELLIGENCE, MILITARY,POLITICAL, AND FINANCIAL </p><p>CAPABILITIES TO TOPPLE SADDAM NOT BECAUSE HE IS A SOLO </p><p>RULER OR DESPOTIC DICTATOR AS PROPAGATED BY U.S. MEDIA </p><p>ORGANS AS WELL AS DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS. THIS DOES NOT CONCERN THE UNITED STATES </p><p>WHATSOEVER. HOWEVER, WHAT CONCERNS IT IS THE FACT THAT </p><p>THE PANARAB IRAQI LEADERSHIP - NOT JUST SADDAM ALONE - </p><p>REFUSES TO SUBMIT TO DOMINANT U.S. POWER AND ALSO </p><p>REFUSES TO ORBIT IN THE U.S. CELESTIAL SPHERE AND TO </p><p>SUCCUMB TO U.S. HEGEMONY, INFLUENCE, AND THE DICTATIONS </p><p>OF U.S. POLICY. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS SOME SORT </p><p>OF A PERSONAL VENDETTA THAT PROMPTS THE U.S. PRESIDENT </p><p>TO TAKE REVENGE FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN AFTER GEORGE BUSH </p><p>SR. HAD FAILED TO OUST THE IRAQI PRSIDENT." </p><p> </p><p>AFTER NOTING THAT THE UNITED STATES IS ACCUSING IRAQ OF </p><p>TERRORISM AND OF POSSESSING WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>DESTRUCTION, ABSI CONCLUDES: "THE RACIST ZIONIST ENTITY </p><p>IN OCCUPIED PALESTINE IS THE UNDECLARED PRETEXT, BEHIND </p><p>WHICH U.S. CALLS FOR EXPEDITING THE TOPPLING OF THE </p><p>IRAQI LEADERSHIP HIDE. WASHINGTON CONSIDERS THE IRAQI </p><p>REGIME AND BAGHDAD\'S REJECTION OF U.S.-ZIONIST PROJECTS </p><p>TO SETTLE THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE\'S ISSUE AS A THREAT TO </p><p>THIS ENTITY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO SINCE IRAQ - DESPITE </p><p>THE UNJUST SIEGE THAT HAS BEEN IMPOSED ON IT FOR OVER </p><p>TEN YEARS - IS STILL CHAMPIONING AND WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>CHAMPION THE ARAB DREAM AND STAND AGAINST ALL </p><p>IMPERIALIST AND ZIONIST SCHEMES, WHICH SEEK TO MAKE THE </p><p>ARAB NATION DROP TO ITS KNEES." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES ON THE QUADRIPARTITE MEETING </p><p> </p><p>-- "THE NEW YORK MEETING AND U.S. SELECTIVITY" </p><p> </p><p>COMMENTING ON THE QUADRIPARTITE COMMITTEE\'S MEETING IN </p><p>NEW YORK, TAHER AL-ADWAN, CHIEF EDITOR OF INDEPENDENT, </p><p>MASS-APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM WRITES ON JULY </p><p>17: "THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF JORDAN, EGYPT, AND SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA WENT TO NEW YORK TO MEET WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>QUADRIPARTITE COMMITTEE WHILE HOLDING A WEAK STAND . . </p><p>. IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT INTER-ARAB DIFFERENCES OVER </p><p>PARTICIPATION AND REPRESENTATION AT THE QUADRIPATITE </p><p>COMMITTEE\'S MEETING SHOULD RENDER ANY DECISION MADE A </p><p>MERE CONSECRATION OF THE STATE OF ARAB WEAKNESS." </p><p> </p><p>ADWAN CONCLUDES: "WE DEMAND THAT THE THREE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTERS DEFEND THE ARAB STAND AS A WHOLE. THIS WILL </p><p>REQUIRE THEM TO CONVINCE THE QUADRIPARTITE COMMITTEE TO </p><p>AGREE TO MEET WITH ALL MEMBERS OF THE FOLLOW-UP </p><p>COMMITTEE. THE FACT IS THAT U.S. SELECTIVITY AT THIS </p><p>QUADRIPARTITE COMMITTEE\'S MEETING MAY PAVE THE WAY FOR </p><p>FUTURE SELECTIVITY WHEN THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IS </p><p>CONVENES. INDEED, THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL, WHICH </p><p>NOWADAYS REFUSE TO MEET OR DEAL WITH ARAFAT, MAY DEMAND </p><p>THE EXCLUSION OF SYRIA AND LEBANON FROM THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE. THIS IN ITSELF IS A </p><p>DISASTEROUS POLICY THAT SERVES THE U.S. POLICY OF </p><p>SUPERIORITY, WHICH DOES NOT SEE BEYOND SHARON\'S NOSE." </p><p> </p><p>-- "THE NEW YORK MEETINGS" </p><p> </p><p>CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR </p><p>(07/17) EDITORIALIZES: "THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS </p><p>IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL MEETING CAN OFFER A NEW PUSH </p><p>FOR THE PEACE PROCESS IF IT TAKES THE RIGHT START BY </p><p>BASICALLY CONSECRATING THE ISSUE OF WITHDRAWAL OF </p><p>OCCUPATION FORCES FROM PALESTINIAN CITIES AND TOWNS TO </p><p>PAVE THE WAY FOR REQUIRED REFORMS ON THE PART OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY." </p><p> </p><p>AL-DUSTOUR ADDS: "WE ALREADY REALIZE THAT THE UNITED </p><p>STATES HAS THE FIRST SAY IN THE QUADRIPARTITE </p><p>COMMITTEE\'S MEETINGS. HOWEVER, OPPOSITION FROM THE REST </p><p>OF THE PARTIES OF THE U.S. VIEW, WHICH IS TOTALLY </p><p>IDENTICAL TO THAT OF THE ISRAELI VIEW, SHOULD LEAVE A </p><p>RAY OF HOPE OF PUTTING THE NEW YORK MEETINGS ON THE </p><p>RIGHT TRACK. THIS SHOULD YIELD PARCTICAL AND TANGIBLE </p><p>RESULTS THAT COULD OPEN THE ROAD FOR A RETURN TO </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>AL-DUSTOUR CONCLUDES: "WE HOPE THAT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EFFORT WILL SUCCEED IN GIVING THE PEACE PROCESS A REAL </p><p>PUSH FORWARD AND THAT THE PARTIES WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>ACHIEVE PRACTICAL AND TANGIBLE RESULTS ON THE GROUND." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
