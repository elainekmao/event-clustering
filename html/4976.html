(SBU) SUMMARY: On 24 December, the UAEG </p><p>announced a four month amnesty period for illegal </p><p>workers to leave the UAE between 1 January 2003 </p><p>and 30 April 2003.  Deportees will be exempt from </p><p>the payment of fines or other legal liabilities </p><p>associated with residency and immigration </p><p>violations.  Press reports estimate that </p><p>approximately 300,000-350,000 illegals will take </p><p>advantage of this general amnesty and leave the </p><p>UAE.  Designed to stabilize the local labor </p><p>market and alleviate the growing demographic </p><p>imbalance, the UAEG has launched a massive media </p><p>and public awareness campaign to maximize the </p><p>number of illegals seeking amnesty and eradicate </p><p>thoughts that general amnesties will be a regular </p><p>feature. The proof of the UAEG\'s commitment to </p><p>reduce the number of illegals, however, will be </p><p>in how it deals with and whether it will clamp </p><p>down on the Emirati visa trade -- a significant </p><p>source of income, especially for poorer UAE </p><p>citizens.  Furthermore, it is doubtful that the </p><p>amnesty program will have any impact on the </p><p>demographic imbalance in the UAE; we suspect that </p><p>many amnesty-seekers will regularize their status </p><p>in their home countries and return to the </p><p>lucrative UAE market if possible.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FOUR MONTH GENERAL AMNESTY ANNOUNCED </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On 24 December, the UAEG announced a four </p><p>month amnesty for illegal workers to leave the </p><p>UAE between 1 January 2003 and 30 April 2003. The </p><p>amnesty is a general pardon that exempts </p><p>violators of the UAE\'s immigration and residency </p><p>laws from the payment of fines or other legal </p><p>liabilities associated with such violations.  The </p><p>UAEG has announced that most violators will be </p><p>banned from entering the UAE for a one-year </p><p>period and that companies that sponsor </p><p>overstayers will also be blacklisted. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) This is the second time that the UAEG has </p><p>declared a general amnesty period.  The first </p><p>amnesty in 1996 resulted in about 250,000 illegal </p><p>aliens leaving the country.  (See reftel.)  This </p><p>second amnesty was announced only after months of </p><p>deliberations on methods to avoid the loopholes </p><p>in the 1996 amnesty by an inter-ministry </p><p>committee.  The committee is chaired by Interior </p><p>Undersecretary for Security Affairs Major General </p><p>Saif Abdullah Al Sha\'afar, and comprised of </p><p>representatives from the Ministry of Interior; </p><p>Ministry of Justice, Islamic Affairs and Awqaf; </p><p>and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The comprehensive implementation plan </p><p>includes a media and public awareness campaign in </p><p>multiple languages, increased inspections by the </p><p>Labor Ministry, coordination between the Interior </p><p>Ministry and Embassies and Consulates, and a </p><p>stream-lined exit system that will include the </p><p>creation of computerized databases for </p><p>information on those leaving the country.  UAEG </p><p>officials have also appealed to the public to </p><p>assist in ensuring the departure of illegal </p><p>aliens. </p><p> </p><p>CLEANING HOUSE: AMNESTY DESIGNED TO OPERATE </p><p>AS A WORKFORCE AND DEMOGRAPHIC STABILIZER </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Undersecretary for Labor Affairs Dr. </p><p>Khalid Al-Khazraji has expressed that the primary </p><p>reason of the amnesty is to regulate and </p><p>stabilize the local market by cleansing the local </p><p>labor market of marginal and ineffective </p><p>manpower. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Press reports estimate that about </p><p>300,000-350,000 illegal aliens will take </p><p>advantage of this amnesty period and leave the </p><p>country.  Since most of the illegals departing </p><p>the country are expected to be Asian, the UAEG </p><p>perceives that the amnesty will serve to help </p><p>correct its demographic imbalance -- an issue </p><p>considered by many to be a security as well as a </p><p>social issue in a country with a population of </p><p>about 4 million, of which about 600,000 are </p><p>citizens. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The media has reported the following </p><p>informal estimates of amnesty seekers by country: </p><p> </p><p>--India 35,000-40,000 </p><p>--Pakistan 20,000-30,000 </p><p>--Bangladesh 10,000 </p><p>--Sri Lanka 8,000-10,000 </p><p>--Phillipines 5,000-10,000 </p><p>--Indonesia 600 </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) It is anticipated that many amnesty </p><p>seekers will try to depart the UAE at the end of </p><p>the amnesty period to earn more money prior to </p><p>leaving or have more time to possibly legalize </p><p>their status before departure.  Most amnesty </p><p>seekers are expected to be visit visa overstays </p><p>or workers who have been unable to renew their </p><p>work permits because they have absconded from </p><p>their employer and/or sponsor.  Sponsors and </p><p>employers who are subject to fines for failing to </p><p>report run-away workers or not renewing their </p><p>employees\' labor cards will also be exempt from </p><p>the payment of such fines. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Those departing and their sponsors are </p><p>responsible for paying for their transportation </p><p>out of the country.  To maximize the number of </p><p>deportees, embassies and consulates have been </p><p>working with their national airlines to award </p><p>reduced airfare to amnesty seekers and have set </p><p>aside funds to purchase air tickets for those who </p><p>are destitute.  The Labor Ministry also declared </p><p>that local governments have allocated funds to </p><p>cover the expenses of deporting violators during </p><p>the amnesty, particularly those not reported as </p><p>absconding from their sponsors, those who do not </p><p>have sponsors to pay for their deportation, and </p><p>those unable to pay for their own tickets. </p><p> </p><p>LIBERAL AMNESTY TO BE FOLLOWED BY CRACK-DOWN </p><p>AND FULL PUNISHMENT OF VIOLATORS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) With the apparent purpose to eradicate </p><p>the notion that amnesties will be a regular </p><p>occurrence, the Interior Ministry and Labor </p><p>Ministry have both emphasized that, after the </p><p>amnesty period expires, labor and residency laws </p><p>will be enforced strictly, with violators </p><p>punished to the full extent of the law.  The </p><p>Labor Ministry has announced that it will </p><p>increase inspections during the amnesty period </p><p>and will intensify such inspections after the </p><p>amnesty period expires to crackdown on those </p><p>illegals remaining in the country. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The UAEG has done an </p><p>excellent job thus far to market the amnesty and </p><p>encourage illegals to take advantage of this </p><p>opportunity.  Of course, this house cleaning will </p><p>only be successful if followed by strict </p><p>enforcement of labor and immigration laws, as </p><p>promised by the Labor and Interior Ministries. </p><p>The Labor Ministry should be up to the task since </p><p>it has been increasing the number of its </p><p>inspectors and inspections over the past year. </p><p>The proof of the UAEG\'s commitment to reduce the </p><p>number of illegals, however, will be in how it </p><p>deals with and whether it will clamp down on the </p><p>Emirati visa trade -- a significant source of </p><p>income, especially for poorer UAE citizens. </p><p>Furthermore, it is doubtful that the amnesty </p><p>program will have any impact on the demographic </p><p>imbalance in the UAE; we suspect that many </p><p>amnesty-seekers will regularize their status in </p><p>their home countries and return to the lucrative </p><p>UAE market if possible.  We will report on the </p><p>success or failure of the amnesty and its </p><p>implementation as things progress.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
