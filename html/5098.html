<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ADANA 0009 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>JANUARY 11-12, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for January 11-12, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for </p><p>the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  BODIES OF NINE FOREIGNERS CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED </p><p>(Milli Gazete/Cumhuriyet)  The Diyarbakir </p><p>Governor\'s Office wrote to several Embassies to </p><p>help identify nine foreigners who were among the 75 </p><p>victims of the plane that crashed in Diyarbakir on </p><p>January 8.  A five-person delegation from the Civil </p><p>Aviation National Directorate arrived in Diyarbakir </p><p>on January 10 to investigate the crash.  In </p><p>addition, an investigation is also underway to find </p><p>out the owner of USD 170,000 found on the plane. </p><p>The paper noted that an American came to Diyarbakir </p><p>but was not able to identify the (American\'s) body. </p><p>His family will come from the U.S.  Based on the </p><p>January 10 broadcast of some private television </p><p>stations, Milliyet wrote that British national </p><p>Muhammed Nazmu Haque, one of the crash victims, was </p><p>said to be a member of the British Secret Service, </p><p>MI-5, appointed to watch hot developments in the </p><p>region.  Hurriyet reported allegations that two </p><p>foreigners, Mahmod Dara and Hardi Mohammed Ali, </p><p>whose nationalities could not be identified, were </p><p>MI-5 agents.  An investigation is underway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  THY BEGINS TO PAY REPARATIONS </p><p>(Radikal/Hurriyet/Cumhuriyet)  Turkish Airlines </p><p>(THY) has begun to pay USD 21,000 in reparations </p><p>for the victims of the RJ 100-type plane that </p><p>crashed in Diyarbakir.  The insurance company will </p><p>determine the definite amount of indemnity to be </p><p>paid to the victims\' relatives.  The Turkish </p><p>General Staff (TGS) strongly criticized reports </p><p>that "the TGS had prevented the installment of an </p><p>Instrument Landing System (ILS)" at the Diyarbakir </p><p>Airport.  The TGS denied having received any </p><p>applications to install an ILS system in </p><p>Diyarbakir. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  ADANA AIRPORT TO RESUME OPERATION AS OF </p><p>    JANUARY 15 </p><p>(Hurriyet)  Cengiz Asikli, President of the Adana </p><p>State Airports Administration (DHMI) Senior </p><p>Director, announced the Adana Airport would re-open </p><p>to flights beginning on January 15.  The airport </p><p>was closed to flights on November 4 for repair and </p><p>maintenance.  Asikli said a 110-person team </p><p>continued to work three shifts to complete the </p><p>repair project.  "If weather conditions permit, we </p><p>will not postpone the re-opening of the airport," </p><p>Asikli added.  THY officials said they have not yet </p><p>begun to sell tickets although the DHMI informed </p><p>them when the airport would re-open. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  ANTI-WAR PROTESTS </p><p>(Evrensel)  A group of 150 Mersin residents </p><p>gathered in front of the Democratic People\'s Party </p><p>(DEHAP) office upon a call by the Mersin Anti-War </p><p>Platform to protest U.S. imperialism.  Officials </p><p>and members of the Democratic People\'s Party </p><p>(DEHAP), the People\'s Democracy Party (HADEP), the </p><p>Labor Party (EMEP), the Social Democrat Party </p><p>(SDP), and the Turkish Communist Party (TKP) </p><p>participated in the protest, criticizing U.S. </p><p>preparations to attack Iraq.  The DEHAP provincial </p><p>chairman read a joint declaration on behalf of the </p><p>platform saying U.S. reasons to hit Iraq were far </p><p>from convincing, the current administration in Iraq </p><p>was a also product of U.S. imperialism and that the </p><p>U.S. was the largest producer and seller of weapons </p><p>of mass destruction.  According to the declaration, </p><p>the U.S. intended to re-draw the region\'s map in </p><p>order to control oil fields in Iraq and the Middle </p><p>East.  In a January 11 press conference, the </p><p>Diyarbakir Peace Platform said the scope and </p><p>outcome of a possible Iraq war planned according to </p><p>the benefit of the U.S. and its allies would be </p><p>devastating in Turkey.  On January 12, The Tunceli </p><p>Anti-war Platform held an anti-war rally attended </p><p>by nearly 1,000 people carrying "No to the </p><p>Imperialist War".  Erdogan Colak of the Adana </p><p>Pharmacists\' Chamber said said no one would remain </p><p>insensitive to U.S. preparations to attack Iraq, </p><p>noting that every pharmacy would display an anti- </p><p>war poster.  In addition, political parties, mass </p><p>organizations and business organizations are </p><p>scheduled to hold an anti-war rally on January 18, </p><p>with the Egitim-Sen teachers union launching a </p><p>petition drive and collecting 1,000 signatures in </p><p>three days.  Also, Diyarbakir police arrested six </p><p>Labor Party (EMEP) members for displaying banners </p><p>reading, "We do not want a government that is a </p><p>puppet of the U.S., Let\'s Stop Invasion of Iraq." </p><p>The arrestees were later released. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  ANTI-WAR STATEMENTS FROM THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>(Evrensel)  Issues such as war, youth and women\'s </p><p>struggle were on the agenda of the People\'s </p><p>Democracy Party (HADEP) Youth Commission during its </p><p>January 6-7 Youth Conference in Diyarbakir. </p><p>Participants emphasized the need for youths to play </p><p>a leading role against U.S. aggression, </p><p>underscoring that joint struggle would stop war. </p><p>AK Party, which had expressed reservations with </p><p>respect to a possible U.S. war in Iraq before the </p><p>(November 3) elections, was criticized for </p><p>forgetting its promises to the public.  A Dicle </p><p>University (Diyarbakir) student said that all </p><p>Diyarbakir and Batman hotels had been reserved for </p><p>U.S. soldiers.  Prolonged deployment of U.S. </p><p>soldiers in Diyarbakir will negatively impact the </p><p>Kurdish culture and values, he argued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  TURKISH RED CRESCENT TEAM IN SIRNAK </p><p>(Milli Gazete)  A ten-person delegation </p><p>representing the Turkish Red Crescent Society </p><p>arrived in Sirnak\'s Silopi township to prepare for </p><p>Iraqi nationals likely to cross into Turkey in the </p><p>event of an intervention against Iraq.  The team </p><p>will reportedly engage in the establishment of </p><p>proposed tent cities (along the Iraqi border).  The </p><p>team visited the Sirnak Governor\'s, the Silopi </p><p>District Governor\'s, and the Habur Local </p><p>Administrator\'s Offices, as well as the </p><p>municipality of Silopi and other (public) </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  GAS MASK INTRODUCTION IN ADANA </p><p>(Turkiye)  Residents of Adana, home to the Incirlik </p><p>Air Base, are concerned over a possible U.S. </p><p>operation against Iraq, while gas mask importers </p><p>are now engaged in increased activities.  A gas </p><p>mask supplier, together with a former Civil Defense </p><p>Director, introduced gas masks that are guaranteed </p><p>by the Turkish Standard Institute and can be used </p><p>against chemical gases, urging citizens not to use </p><p>cheap, illegally-imported gas masks.  The supplier </p><p>said he was selling gas masks at TL 200 million </p><p>(approx. USD 120) each and filters at TL 50 million </p><p>(approx. USD 30) each.  He noted the bigger demand </p><p>was from factories, companies and media </p><p>organizations sending personnel to an environment </p><p>of war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  RADIKAL:  TORTURE, PKK/KADEK ACTIVITIES </p><p>(Radikal)  on January 10, the Parliamentary Human </p><p>Rights Commission listened to National Police and </p><p>Jandarma officials who in their report said the </p><p>Democratic People\'s Party (DEHAP), which they </p><p>associate with PKK-KADEK, had failed to attain the </p><p>results it had anticipated in the November 3 </p><p>Parliamentary elections.  The report said illegal </p><p>organizations\' field of activity had expanded after </p><p>the lifting of the State of Emergency (OHAL), with </p><p>illegal organizations\' activities increasing in the </p><p>offices of political parties, associations and </p><p>culture centers.  "The organization (i.e., PKK- </p><p>KADEK) is preparing to stage demonstrations to </p><p>abolish the village guard system," the report </p><p>claimed.  In response to the commission\'s </p><p>questions, national security directorate officials </p><p>denied allegations of "torturer police officers," </p><p>describing such allegations as "efforts by illegal </p><p>organizations to increase the number of </p><p>applications to the European Court of Human Rights </p><p>(ECHR)".  Speaking of a proposal to make torturers </p><p>pay indemnity ordered by the ECHR, the officials </p><p>said such a regulation would reduce the number of </p><p>torture allegations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  OHAL GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN </p><p>Evrensel reported that OHAL in the minds of police </p><p>is not lifted.  Regarding the "Evaluation of the </p><p>State of Emergency (OHAL) and Adjacent Provinces" </p><p>report submitted by the National Security </p><p>Directorate to the Parliamentary Human Rights </p><p>Commission, the paper reported police viewed </p><p>activities carried out by labor unions, students </p><p>and workers asserting their rights in the Southeast </p><p>as "extension of illegal organizations and support </p><p>to an illegal organization (i.e., PKK/KADEK)."  The </p><p>report characterized college students\' pro-native </p><p>language (i.e., Kurdish) education petitions as "a </p><p>terror organization\'s (i.e., PKK/KADEK) legal work </p><p>/ operation."  The report also described human </p><p>rights violations cries from the Southeast and </p><p>applications to the European Court of Human Rights </p><p>as "an effort to produce decisions against our </p><p>country".  Milli Gazete reported the formation of </p><p>six sub-commissions by the Parliament to travel to </p><p>inspect some provinces that remain within the </p><p>jurisdiction of the OHAL Governor\'s Office, between </p><p>January 10-13.  These provinces are Diyarbakir, </p><p>Bingol, Mus, Batman, Mardin, and Tunceli. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  PRO-OCALAN PROTESTS CONTINUE </p><p>(Evrensel)  In Manisa, Batman, Van and Diyarbakir </p><p>provinces, groups of people, including children, </p><p>staged demonstrations and marches to protest </p><p>isolation of KADEK (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan. </p><p>Ocalan was prevented from meeting with his </p><p>attorneys and family members for the past six </p><p>weeks.  The protestors shouted pro-Ocalan slogans, </p><p>as police took intense security measures during </p><p>these protest demonstrations.  In addition, </p><p>Republican People\'s Party (CHP) Tunceli Deputy </p><p>Sinan Yerlikaya, Justice and Development Party </p><p>(AKP) Agri Deputy Halil Ozyolcu, AKP Bingol Deputy </p><p>Feyzi Berdibek, and AKP Mardin Deputy Nihat Eri </p><p>emphasized the need for the government to refrain </p><p>from unlawful attitudes that might lead to tension, </p><p>at a time when there was need for social peace. </p><p>They said laws and rules must be applied to all, </p><p>without discrimination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  DIONYSUS STATUE DISCOVERED IN ANCIENT CITY OF </p><p>     ZEUGMA </p><p>(Radikal/Bolge)  A statue of Dionysus (God of Wine) </p><p>symbolizing pleasure and amusement was unearthed in </p><p>the ancient city of Zeugma when the level of water </p><p>in the reservoir behind Sanliurfa\'s Birecik Dam </p><p>decreased three meters, helping the statue surface. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  KONUKOGLU:  WE CHANGED OUR ANCESTORS\' SHOPS </p><p>     INTO HOLDING COMPANIES </p><p>(Turkiye)  Abdulkadir Konukoglu, President of the </p><p>Gaziantep-based Sanko Holding Company, said the </p><p>fact that the State did not make investments played </p><p>a big role in the success of the Anatolian (Eastern </p><p>and Southeastern Turkey) industrial base. </p><p>Konukoglu attributed Gaziantep\'s industrial </p><p>development to no (State) investments other than </p><p>the railway, the State tobacco and liquor monopoly </p><p>TEKEL, and the cement sector, which was later </p><p>privatized.  According to Konukoglu, in Gaziantep, </p><p>Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Armenians lived </p><p>together for centuries, starting their own </p><p>businesses by learning about handcrafts from one </p><p>another.  "Our ancestors (grandfathers) turned </p><p>these shops into small plants, our fathers into </p><p>factories, and we into holding companies," he </p><p>added.  "If the State had made investments, my </p><p>grandfather would leave his handcrafts business and </p><p>become or wait to become a public employee, and </p><p>then we would not have these plants." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  MERSIN PLANT TEARS DOWN CHIMNEYS POLLUTING </p><p>     ENVIRONMENT </p><p>(Bolge/Turkiye)  Mersin-based Kromsan Factory, an </p><p>affiliate of the Sisecam Holding Company, held a </p><p>ceremony to bring down its two 19-year-old chimneys </p><p>due to allegations that they had polluted the </p><p>environment.  Mersin Governor Akif Tig attended the </p><p>ceremony, during which he said the 100- and 110- </p><p>meter chimneys were being torn down due to </p><p>transition to new technology and for economic </p><p>reasons.  Tig praised the factory for storing its </p><p>(industrial) waste with the help of new technology, </p><p>instead and added it had contributed to the </p><p>national economy by exporting 70% of its </p><p>production. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
