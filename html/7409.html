<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 35 (4/13 1745 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Amman was calm throughout the weekend.  We did not </p><p>hear reports of significant demonstrations or protests </p><p>anywhere in the country. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Embassy opened April 13 for normal business. </p><p>Activities at the American Language Center and the Peace </p><p>Corps offices remain suspended.  Movements of American </p><p>personnel remain restricted.  The investigation continues </p><p>into the April 8 shooting incident involving an Embassy TDYer. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) One purported Amcit currently is being held at </p><p>no-man\'s land at the Trebil border crossing after he was </p><p>refused entry by Jordanian authorities.  The Amcit told UNHCR </p><p>and GOJ authorities that he would voluntarily return to Iraq </p><p>but wanted to wait until other members of his traveling party </p><p>arrived at the border.  He refused to show his passport to </p><p>UNHCR officials.  This purported Amcit is traveling with a </p><p>large group of Iranians suspected by the GOJ of being members </p><p>of Mujahidin-e-Khalq (MEK).  We presume that the purported </p><p>Amcit is of Iranian origin as well.  Conoff will attempt to </p><p>get identity of Amcit from GOJ authorities.  If successful, </p><p>we will provide the identity immediately to the task force. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Local press gave prominent coverage April 13 to King </p><p>Abdullah\'s and Queen Rania\'s April 12 blood donation for </p><p>Iraqi war casualties.  The official Petra News Service stated </p><p>"Their Majesties donated their blood for the Iraqi wounded to </p><p>consecrate their support for the Iraqi people and reflect the </p><p>bonds of blood and brotherly ties between Jordan and Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Petra News Service also quoted Jordan Armed Forces </p><p>(JAF) General Mohammad Majed al-Eitan, Director of the </p><p>national Crisis Management Center, as saying that Jordan </p><p>would set up a field hospital in Iraq as early as next week </p><p>to provide medical services: "Consultations are currently </p><p>underway with members of the Iraqi Embassy in Amman and </p><p>coalition forces in Baghdad to send the field hospital that </p><p>will be able to carry out general surgery as well as provide </p><p>emergency medical services." </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Minister of Information Mohammad al-Adwan called April </p><p>12 for coalition forces in Iraq to put an end to civil unrest </p><p>in Iraq.  Al-Adwan stated "We express our concern over the </p><p>anarchy, looting and vandalism under way in Baghdad and other </p><p>regions of Iraq.  Maintaining security and stability must be </p><p>the priority in Iraq, as well as providing immediate </p><p>assistance to the brethren Iraqi people." </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7 (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (u)  First quarter export figures released by the Irbid </p><p>Chamber of Industry show a 45% increase over exports from Q1 </p><p>of 2002.  QIZ garment exports continue to represent over 90% </p><p>of all exports from the Al Hassan Industrial Estate in Irbid, </p><p>registering 44% growth in Q1 compared to Q1 of last year and </p><p>topping $74.5 million for the quarter. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  On April 12, 96 Iranians arrived at the Jordanian </p><p>side of the Trebil border crossing, seeking temporary UNHCR </p><p>protection until they can be returned to the countries in </p><p>which they allegedly hold refugee status.  The GOJ is </p><p>currently holding the group in no-man\'s land at the border </p><p>but has already told UNHCR that some members of the group, </p><p>including a purported US citizen (see para 2), would not be </p><p>allowed to enter.  The GOJ reportedly believes that this </p><p>group is part of the Mujahadin-e-Khalq (MEK), a US-designated </p><p>foreign terrorist organization.  The Iranians told UNHCR that </p><p>another 28-30 members of their "group" are expected to reach </p><p>the Jordanian-Iraqi border later today, April 13.  UNHCR is </p><p>digging more latrines and erecting more tents to accommodate </p><p>this group but will not be able to accommodate more than 150 </p><p>persons at no-man\'s land. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) UNHCR is skeptical of the group\'s bona fides.  The </p><p>first groups to arrive were all unmarried men in their early </p><p>40s, followed by a group of single women also in their early </p><p>40s.  They claim not to know each other but quickly organized </p><p>themselves to tidy up the tents and assign sleeping quarters. </p><p> UNHCR reports that the group in general seems to be very </p><p>uncomfortable dealing with UNHCR officials.  All 96 Iranians </p><p>who arrived April 12 are carrying European or North American </p><p>travel documents, many of which are UNHCR convention travel </p><p>documents issued in the late 1980s or early 1990s and </p><p>presumably expired.  Some are carrying what appear to be </p><p>fraudulent French cartes de sejour.  The Iranians claim that </p><p>they returned to Iraq just a few weeks ago for the Nowruz </p><p>holiday but their travel documents indicate they have been </p><p>out of their respective countries of asylum for much longer. </p><p>UNHCR is compiling a list of the Iranians and their alleged </p><p>travel documents and will approach each relevant embassy in </p><p>Amman to verify their bona fides.  UNHCR also will demarche </p><p>Jordanian authorities to allow these Iranian entry and most </p><p>likely will raise this case (but not the possible MEK </p><p>connection) at the UN\'s April 13 press briefing.  Jordanian </p><p>authorities are unlikely to agree to this request. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) UNHCR also reports that a group of 200 former Syrian </p><p>Ba\'ath party and Syrian Muslim Brotherhood officials, all </p><p>long-term residents of Iraq who were granted asylum by </p><p>Saddam\'s regime, are headed to the Jordanian border at </p><p>Trebil.  The group reportedly was denied entry by the Syrian </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Situation in Iraq: Jordanian dailies varied in their </p><p>coverage of the situation in Iraq.  While Al-Rai reported a </p><p>drop in looting and that 1200 American policemen would arrive </p><p>in Iraq soon, Al-Dustour highlighted the battles around one </p><p>of the presidential palaces and the two "martyrdom" (suicide) </p><p>attacks against U.S. forces.  Al-Rai called them "commando </p><p>operations." </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Looting: Jordanian dailies all held the U.S. </p><p>responsible for the looting.  Al-Rai interviewed Iraqis in </p><p>Jordan who said that the U.S. forces protected the oil wells </p><p>and oil ministry, but not Iraqi citizens and property. </p><p> </p><p>14.(U) Editorial Commentary:  Bater Wardam in Al-Dustour says </p><p>that the American "occupation army" is instigating and </p><p>helping with the looting because they want to give </p><p>"legitimacy" to their presence in Iraq, and to say that they </p><p>are the only ones capable of bringing order to Iraq.  Wardam </p><p>concludes his article by hoping that the Iraqis will wake up </p><p>and will not allow the Americans to "steal" Iraq.  Urayb </p><p>Rintawi in Al-Dustour defends the Iraqi people\'s actions </p><p>after the fall of the Iraqi regime and strongly criticizes </p><p>all those who blamed the Iraqi people for not fighting.  He </p><p>says that an "oppressed, deprived and degraded people cannot </p><p>make a fighting nation." </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
