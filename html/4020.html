<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 006073 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, XA, ZF, CF, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: DROC PRESIDENT KABILA\'S VISIT TO JORDAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  DROC President Joseph Kabila paid an official visit </p><p>to Jordan September 16-18.  The visit entailed the usual </p><p>meetings and official functions.  Kabila enjoyed a short </p><p>visit to the seaport of Aqaba as the King,s guest.  We saw </p><p>nothing remarkable to report -- except  that Jordan seemed an </p><p>unlikely stop on the very day news coverage was reporting the </p><p>announcement that Rwandan forces were withdrawing from </p><p>eastern Congo. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S)  Subsequently, King Abdullah has raised Kabila,s </p><p>visit with the Ambassador.  Abdullah said he point blank </p><p>asked Kabila why he was visiting Jordan.  Kabila said in the </p><p>first instance he wanted to establish stronger ties between </p><p>Congo and Middle Eastern countries; but, secondly, he knew </p><p>the King had excellent relations with both London and </p><p>Washington.  He did not and, frankly, wanted Abdullah,s </p><p>assistance in helping him improve relations.  He asked the </p><p>King to pass his desire to improve relations to both </p><p>countries and do anything he might to advance that process. </p><p>The King said he agreed to pass on Kabila,s message and </p><p>asked that we inform Washington of his conversation with </p><p>Kabila. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
