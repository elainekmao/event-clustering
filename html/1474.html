(C) SUMMARY: AS OF JANUARY 11, THERE IS STILL NO </p><p>OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) STATEMENT OR </p><p>REACTION TO THE SUPREME COURT RULING OF DECEMBER 21 IN </p><p>FAVOR OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) IN THEIR </p><p>LAWSUIT ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE "FAST-TRACK" </p><p>LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM (REF A).  THERE HAVE, HOWEVER, </p><p>BEEN NUMEROUS VERBAL ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY BY HIGH- </p><p>LEVEL GOZ OFFICIALS.  AT THE OPENING OF THE HIGH COURT </p><p>IN BULAWAYO ON JANUARY 8, THE JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>HIGH COURT, GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU, AN ARDENT MUGABE AND </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTER, LAUNCHED INTO A DIATRIBE AGAINST THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT AND ITS POSITION ON THE LAND REFORM ISSUE, </p><p>STATING THAT THE COURT HAD EFFECTIVELY INVITED THE CFU </p><p>TO SUE THE GOZ OVER THE LAND PROGRAM BY THE COURT\'S </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON THE PROGRAM\'S CONSTITIONALITY.  TWO </p><p>DAYS LATER ON JANUARY 10, AT A CAMPAIGN APPEARANCE FOR A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTION, VICE PRESIDENT MUZENDA </p><p>STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE SUPREME COURT FOR UPHOLDING </p><p>COLONIAL-ERA LAWS THAT DEPRIVE BLACK ZIMBABWEANS OF </p><p>THEIR RIGHTFUL HERITAGE OF THE LAND.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>HIGH COURT JUDGE PRESIDENT ATTACKS THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00240  01 OF 02  121153Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON JANUARY 9 THE GOZ-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" </p><p>NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT ON THE OCCASION OF OFFICIAL </p><p>ANNUAL OPENING OF THE HIGH COURT IN BULAWAYO ON JANUARY </p><p>8, THE JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE HIGH COURT, GODFREY </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU, LASHED OUT AT THE SUPREME COURT FOR ITS </p><p>ROLE IN THE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN ZIMBABWE.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THE JUDGE PRESIDENT IS CONSIDERED BY MOST OBSERVERS TO </p><p>BE AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT MUGABE AND ZANU-PF, </p><p>AND THERE IS SPECULATION THAT WITH THE TIRELESS LOBBYING </p><p>OF HIS FRIEND, MINISTER OF STATE FOR INFORMATION AND </p><p>PUBLICITY JONATHAN MOYO, HE WILL BE NAMED CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>OF THE SUPREME COURT BY MUGABE WHEN THE CURRENT CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE RETIRES IN 2002.  END COMMENT.)  CHIDYAUSIKU DID </p><p>NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTION THE DECEMBER 21 SUPREME COURT </p><p>RULING.  INSTEAD, HE ALLEGED THAT SUPREME COURT CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE ANTONY GUBBAY GAVE COMMERCIAL FARMERS THE GREEN </p><p>LIGHT TO SUE WHEN, IN JANUARY 1991, HE CRITICIZED </p><p>PROVISIONS OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BILL THAT </p><p>SOUGHT TO GIVE THE GO THE POWER TO COMPULSORILY ACQUIRE </p><p>LAND FOR RESETTLEMENT WITHOUT PAYING COMPENSATION.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT GUBBAY\'S COMMENTS ASSURED THE FARMERS THAT </p><p>THEIR LEGAL ACTIONS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU CRITICIZED THE SUPREME COURT\'S RULING </p><p>OVERTURNING HIS OWN RULING THAT GRANTED A STAY OF </p><p>EXECUTION OF THE NOVEMBER 10 SUPREME COURT CONSENT ORDER </p><p>REQUIRING THE GOZ TO REMOVE ILLEGAL OCCUPIERS FROM FARMS </p><p>WITH ALL DUE SPEED (REF B).  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT </p><p>THE RULING WAS BINDING ON THE HIGH COURT, HE ADDED THAT </p><p>HE HAD DIFFICULTY ACCEPTING THE CORRECTNESS OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00240  01 OF 02  121153Z </p><p>RULING FOR VARIOUS REASONS.  PRINCIPAL AMONG THESE WAS </p><p>THAT THE GOZ HAD MADE CLEAR THAT "LAND REDISTRIBUTION IS </p><p>A POLITICAL ISSUE AND NOT A LEGAL ISSUE." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) CHIDYAUSIKU IS REPORTED AS SAYING, "THE </p><p>CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE LAND ISSUE HAS BECOME A </p><p>MINEFIELD FOR THE JUDICIARY.  I ONLY HOPE IT DOES NOT </p><p>BECOME THE GRAVEYARD FOR THE JUDICIARY."  LAWYERS </p><p>PRESENT AT THE HIGH COURT OPENING OBSERVED THAT </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU WAS SO PREOCCUPIED WITH CRITICIZING THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT THAT HE NEVER ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED THE </p><p>FORMAL OPENING OF THE NEW SESSION OF THE HIGH COURT, THE </p><p>POINT OF THE JUDGE\'S PUBLIC APPEARANCE AND STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT MUZENDA ALSO ATTACKS THE JUDICIARY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) VICE PRESIDENT SIMON MUZENDA IN HIS CAPACITY AS </p><p>ACTING PRESIDENT (PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS ON HOLIDAY IN </p><p>MALAYSIA) FOLLOWED UP CHIDYAUSIKU\'S DIATRIBE AGAINST THE </p><p>JUDICIARY WITH HIS OWN AT A JANUARY 10 CAMPAIGN RALLY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7479 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00240  02 OF 02  121153Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      PM-00    P-00     SP-00    STR-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------B576A4  121153Z /38 </p><p>R 121152Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7992 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000240 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 01/12/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: STILL NO OFFICIAL REACTION TO THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT RULING ON THE CFU LAND CASE, JUST GENERALIZED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00240  02 OF 02  121153Z </p><p>ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY </p><p> </p><p>HELD IN BIKITA WEST FOR THE UPCOMING PARLIAMENTARY BY- </p><p>ELECTION.  MUZENDA CRITICIZED THE JUDICIARY FOR GIVING </p><p>FAVORABLE JUDGEMENTS TO COMMERCIAL FARMERS AT THE </p><p>EXPENSE OF THE MAJORITY OF BLACKS THAT REMAIN LANDLESS </p><p>AND IMPOVERISHED.  MUZENDA STATED THAT HE FAILED "TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND JUDGES WHO, IN THEIR JUDGEMENT, ACKNOWLEDGE </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWEANS WERE COLONIZED...DEPRIVED OF THEIR </p><p>LAND...AND THEIR RIGHTS BY WHITE COLONIZERS.  YET THEY </p><p>PROCEED, WITHIN THE SAME JUDGEMENT, TO INSIST ON THE </p><p>SANCTITY OF THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THE SAME WHITE MAN </p><p>WHO TODAY THRIVES ON ILL-GOTTEN WEALTH." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: THE ABSENCE OF AN OFFICIAL GOZ COMMENT </p><p>ON THE DECEMBER 21 SUPREME COURT RULING, WHILE GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS MAKE SCURRILOUS ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY, </p><p>INDICATES TO US THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE MAY STILL BE </p><p>CONSIDERING HIS OPTIONS ON LAND REFORM.  THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT RULING DID LEAVE MUGABE AND THE GOZ SOME WIGGLE </p><p>ROOM ON ITS LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, AND THEY CONTINUE </p><p>TO HOLD OUT HOPE THAT DONORS WILL RETURN TO ZIMBABWE </p><p>WITH MONEY FOR LAND REFORM.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
