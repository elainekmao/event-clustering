<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000929 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, GT, UN, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NGOS UPBEAT ON CICIACS DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 890 </p><p>     B. STATE 77340 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Embassy officers met with human rights </p><p>activists Frank LaRue, Claudia Samayoa, and Orlando Blanco on </p><p>April 2 to discuss both the recent protest by human rights </p><p>groups in front of the Embassy and their silence on Cuban </p><p>dissident jailing (Ref A), as well as steps that the Embassy </p><p>can take to help the NGOs move the Commission to Investigate </p><p>Illegal Bodies and the Clandestine Security Apparatus </p><p>(CICIACS) proposal forward.  Embassy officers offered </p><p>technical expertise to help NGOs analyze investigative models </p><p>of possible use to the CICIACS.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On April 2, representatives from POL, NAS, ICITAP, </p><p>AID, and RSO met with human rights activists to address </p><p>questions emerging from DAS Fisk\'s meeting with Jose Miguel </p><p>Vivanco (Ref B), and to demonstrate our continuing moral and </p><p>technical support for the NGOs as they push the formation of </p><p>the CICIACS forward.  We discussed the commission set-up, the </p><p>NGO\'s latest dealings with the GOG, the budget progress, the </p><p>commission candidates, and further steps for Embassy-NGO </p><p>collaboration. </p><p> </p><p>From Here to September: A Cloudy Process </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) According to LaRue (and confirmed to us by the MFA), </p><p>the GOG has appointed former Ambassador to the Court of St. </p><p>James, Maritza Ruiz de Vielman to handle GOG negotiations </p><p>with the UN and the OAS for the creation of the CICIACS. </p><p>Ruiz de Vielman drafted an initial agreement in which the GOG </p><p>would establish the CICIACS under the Secretary of Peace </p><p>(SEPAZ), a domestic institution in which the NGOs have little </p><p>confidence.  The Human Rights Ombudsman communicated with FM </p><p>Gutierrez to say that the NGOs were not supportive of that </p><p>idea and that the CICIACS had to be set up as an </p><p>international commission for the NGOs and the international </p><p>community to support it.  Gutierrez reportedly agreed, saying </p><p>that Ruiz de Vielman misunderstood the March 13 agreement </p><p>from which she drew her proposal, and that the GOG also wants </p><p>an international commission.  To that end, Gutierrez sent </p><p>Ruiz de Vielman to New York on April 1, to lobby the UN and </p><p>start the official exchange of letters. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) As NGOs understand the situation, the GOG and the UN </p><p>and OAS will now exchange letters proposing a joint </p><p>commission, and this series of agreements will then be </p><p>submitted to Congress for ratification.  The NGOs have heard </p><p>that commissions of this size need only the approval of the </p><p>Secretaries General of the UN and OAS, and need not be </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>submitted to these organizations\' general assemblies.  The </p><p>NGO representatives also told us that they have heard that </p><p>both UN SecGen Annan and OAS SecGen Gaviria are already on </p><p>board in support of CICIACS. </p><p> </p><p>Budget Progress </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The NGOs have delayed further work on the CICIACS </p><p>budget, instead choosing to focus their energies on the </p><p>set-up of the commission.  Once the UN and the OAS have </p><p>confirmed their involvement, and agreed on the scope, </p><p>mandate, and timing of the CICIACS, the NGOs hope that these </p><p>organizations will provide fiscal experts to help them </p><p>develop a realistic budget. </p><p> </p><p>Commission Candidates </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Human rights activists Nery Rodenas and Orlando Blanco </p><p>are traveling to the UN and the OAS on April 9 to present </p><p>their ideas for candidates for the commission and to solicit </p><p>feedback.  Frank LaRue told DCM and PolOffs that their top </p><p>choices currently are Peruvians Jose Ugaz and Gino Costa. </p><p>LaRue separately told the Ambassador that they were also </p><p>considering Guatemalan Ramon Cadena, whom the Attorney </p><p>General said was his choice to replace Tatiana Morales as </p><p>Human Rights Prosecutor in the Public Ministry. (Note: LaRue </p><p>doubted that Cadena would accept a job offer from De Leon. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Next Steps </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The NGOs have items that they would like to discuss </p><p>with Embassy experts in the future.  Many of them have to do </p><p>with the role of the Public Ministry, including how the </p><p>CICIACS will provide protection for the special prosecutor </p><p>appointed by the Attorney General, how the CICIACS will help </p><p>improve the Public Ministry, and how the CICIACS will protect </p><p>witnesses and investigators.  The NGOs also wondered if we </p><p>had any advice on how to mount a public relations campaign to </p><p>help educate the average Guatemalan about clandestine groups </p><p>and the aims of CICIACS.  NGOs intend to contact the Embassy </p><p>to discuss this after the official exchange of letters </p><p>between the UN, OAS, and GOG. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The NGOs were appreciative of our continued support. </p><p>They trust the GOG\'s interlocutor, Ruiz de Vielman, and are </p><p>hopeful that the commission set-up will proceed along the </p><p>lines they envisioned.  We will continue our support and </p><p>inform the Department about further requests for </p><p>collaboration.  End Comment. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
