<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000939 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EX, HR/OE </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>RIO FOR WEISSMAN </p><p>PRETORIA PASS AG ATTACHE HELM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/07 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMERCIAL FARMERS PESSIMISTIC RE: BOTH SHORT </p><p>AND LONG TERM PROSPECTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY ECONOFF K BEL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: DCM and Laboff met with three </p><p>representatives of the Commercial Farmers\' Union (CMF) </p><p>- David Hasluck, Director, Malcolm Voles, Deputy </p><p>Director, and Colin Cloete, President, on April 11, </p><p>2002.  The CFU had requested the meeting as a "reality </p><p>check" on the post-election situation of the </p><p>commercial farmers (CFs) in Zimbabwe.  The CFs were </p><p>pessimistic regarding their ability to "sit out" the </p><p>situation in hopes of improved post-election </p><p>prospects.  They were similarly dismissive of GOZ </p><p>projections that winter crops, grown with or without </p><p>the participation of the CFs, could yield enough to </p><p>meaningfully address Zimbabwe\'s critical food </p><p>shortfall.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Situation Regarding the Commercial Farmers (CFs) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The CFU reps were very downbeat regarding the </p><p>GOZ land resettlement program.  Although the farmers </p><p>had hoped for some easing of the situation post- </p><p>election, they have seen "more of the same" in the </p><p>form of farm occupations, acquisitions, and the </p><p>targeting of white commercial farmers.  In fact, the </p><p>CFs have seen an increase in A-2 settlers (A-2 is the </p><p>GOZ\'s indigenous, small-scale commercial farmer </p><p>program) who receive entire farms rather than pared- </p><p>down sustenance plots.  The CFU\'s assessment is that </p><p>white commercial farmers are no longer viewed by the </p><p>leadership as a key component of the Zimbabwean </p><p>economy, with attendant rights. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The CFU does not believe that the majority of </p><p>its members will be able, on an economic basis, to </p><p>"sit it out" much longer.  In addition to loss of </p><p>income and the shrinking value of any savings, the </p><p>farmers are facing their routine obligations - debt </p><p>payments, tuition payments, and living costs, the net </p><p>result being forced migration. </p><p> </p><p>Future Economic Projections for CFs in Zimbabwe </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Of 4,500 paid members in the CFU prior to the </p><p>land acquisition scheme, the number has dwindled to </p><p>approximately 3,200 members - a decline of more than </p><p>one quarter.  Further, about 50% of the remaining </p><p>farmers are having major operating or viability </p><p>problems.  The CFU stated that this year had seen </p><p>approximately $250 million in forex income, of which </p><p>the producers were the main beneficiaries.  This </p><p>amount is down from the $350 million which was </p><p>expected. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) When asked whether the CFs would be able to put </p><p>crops in next year if they "rode it out" for this </p><p>year, the CFU responded that there were both political </p><p>and social elements to the question.  The CFs believe </p><p>that surviving for six to eight months without being </p><p>on the farm would be extremely difficult, noting that </p><p>the equipment and assets of the farms would certainly </p><p>be stolen/looted during the farmers\' absence.  They </p><p>noted as well that the figures coming out from the </p><p>Central Bank were increasingly unbelievable.  They </p><p>feared that the economy would become de-monetized to </p><p>the point that people would refuse to accept money for </p><p>goods and services. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The CFU complained that Agriculture Minister </p><p>Made\'s projections regarding the capacity of the </p><p>government to grow winter crops were outrageous.  They </p><p>noted that Minister of State Security Goche, rather </p><p>than the Minister of Agriculture, was ostensibly in </p><p>control of this project.  Although the government has </p><p>reportedly already placed an order for fertilizer for </p><p>the winter wheat crop, the official estimate of the </p><p>amount of wheat which could be grown was far out of </p><p>balance with reality.  While the GOZ publicly stated </p><p>plans to plant 45,000 hectares of wheat by October </p><p>2002, the CFs believed the GOZ would barely be able to </p><p>sow 4,000 hectares.  (UNDP projects a maximum </p><p>hectarage of 10,000, if all goes ideally.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Additionally, the GOZ did not even know who </p><p>would be growing the wheat.  Most of the settlers - </p><p>and particularly the A-2 settlers - had little or no </p><p>farming experience.  There had been some suggestion to </p><p>the CFs that they remain on their homestead and teach </p><p>the new settlers how to farm, a proposition which they </p><p>received with incredulity and disinterest. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) As far as the participation of CFs in the </p><p>winter growth cycle, they stated that while it might </p><p>be possible for them  to plant 20,000 hectares, </p><p>yielding 120,000 tonnes, there were legal constraints </p><p>to contend with as well.  For instance, the issue of </p><p>whether they would be allowed to remain on the farms </p><p>through harvest time is a key, but as yet unanswered, </p><p>question. </p><p> </p><p>CFU Assistance </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) When the CFs asked how they could assist the </p><p>mission, the DCM requested that they keep the Embassy </p><p>informed of the situation and new developments.  In </p><p>addition, the CFs agreed to provide the names of A-2 </p><p>settlers who were being allocated or grabbing large </p><p>chunks of CF assets.  Further, the CFs agreed to keep </p><p>us informed of dialogue or approaches from the GOZ </p><p>that might point to normalization of the situation. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment: Zimbabwe\'s white commercial farmers </p><p>are clearly at the end of their rope, and even their </p><p>previously affixed veneer of optimism about "riding it </p><p>out" is now cracking.  An already destructive solution </p><p>is made worse by the Agriculture Minister\'s recent </p><p>statement that farmers are henceforth not allowed to </p><p>remove equipment - including irrigation systems, </p><p>farming tools, and tractors - from their farms. </p><p>Though such an edict is in clear violation of the law, </p><p>it reflects the GOZ\'s attitude that property rights </p><p>are no longer enjoyed by the commercial farmers.  As </p><p>the realization of their fate becomes clear, more and </p><p>more will be forced to consider options elsewhere, </p><p>with varying but shrinking amounts of movable assets. </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s economic foundation is being dangerously </p><p>eroded as we watch, with parallel damage being </p><p>simultaneously inflicted on its civic foundation.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
