<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002449 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF AND EB </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS TO USTR </p><p>PARIS AND LONDON FOR AFRICA WATCHERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EAID, XA </p><p>SUBJECT: AFRICAN MINISTERS DISMAYED BY FORUM POSTPONEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. African trade ministers participating in the September </p><p>22-23 Organization of African unity (OAU) meeting in Abuja, </p><p>Nigeria nearly unanimously told the delegation led by </p><p>Assistant U.S. Trade Representative (AUSTR) for Africa Rosa </p><p>Whitaker they wanted the United States to hold the </p><p>US-Sub-Saharan Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum on </p><p>October 4-5 as planned. "This event would have given African </p><p>countries an opportunity to show solidarity with the U.S. at </p><p>this difficult time," said Ethiopian Trade   Minister Ayele </p><p>Kassahun. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The forum was postponed on September 18 at the urging of </p><p>African Ambassadors to Washington.  But in a series of </p><p>bilateral meetings with the U.S. delegation on the margins of </p><p>the OAU event, trade ministers and representatives of </p><p>regional economic organizations claimed that Ambassadors </p><p>spoke without consulting their capitals.  "It\'s a lie to say </p><p>African Countries weren,t ready to come to Washington after </p><p>September 11," ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lasana Kouyate </p><p>said.  "On the contrary, Ministers told their staff not to </p><p>stop preparing for the Forum." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  It may prove difficult to find new dates for the Forum in </p><p>the Ministers\' crowded fourth quarter schedules.  As Nigerian </p><p>Trade Minister Mustafa Bello put it,  "We were ready to come </p><p>to the U.S. in early October, but now it may have to be late </p><p>December or January. However, African Trade Ministers </p><p>responded favorably to the notion of a U.S. - Africa Trade </p><p>Ministerial before Doha, focused on AGOA and the WTO </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
