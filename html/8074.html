<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000902 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI ARMY REJECTS 5KM RESTRICTION DEMANDED BY </p><p>MAOISTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 0860 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>ARMY SAYS IT IS NOT RESTRICTING MOVEMENT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On May 14 Col. Deepak Gurung, spokesman for the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army (RNA), publicly denied that the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) had agreed to confine soldiers to a 5-km radius </p><p>of their barracks, as reported by Maoist negotiators, the </p><p>press, and other sources close to the negotiations (Reftel). </p><p>Gurung said that the RNA had received no written order from </p><p>the Ministry of Defense notifying it of any restriction of </p><p>movement.  Maoist negotiator and spokesman Krishna Bahadur </p><p>Mahara, speaking at a joint press conference, with GON </p><p>negotiator Minister Narayan Singh Pun at his side, had </p><p>announced the purported agreement immediately after the </p><p>second round of talks on May 9.  Pun did not dispute Mahara\'s </p><p>characterization at the time, adding only that the agreement </p><p>would take time to implement. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>GON "BACK-PEDALING"? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Almost immediately after the announcement--and the </p><p>RNA\'s understandable dismay at it--the GON began frantic </p><p>efforts to walk back the commitment apparently made by its </p><p>negotiators.  The British Ambassador, who met with Prime </p><p>Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand on May 12, told the Charge </p><p>that the GON and the Palace were "back-pedaling," attempting </p><p>to cast the reported restriction as a suggestion proposed for </p><p>consideration.  Later that same evening, RNA Adjutant Maj. </p><p>Gen. Dilip Karki told the Charge in private that the RNA </p><p>would not tolerate limitation upon its freedom of movement. </p><p>As the legitimate national army, Karki said, it is imperative </p><p>that the RNA have access to all parts of the country.  Other </p><p>officers pointed out that the 5km restriction would prevent </p><p>the army from patrolling large stretches of the border, </p><p>national parks, and performing other functions essential to </p><p>its mandate. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The limitation would also hinder the RNA from </p><p>carrying out a variety of civil affairs programs, including </p><p>mobile medical clinics, that have reportedly increased their </p><p>popularity and visibility in remote areas (septel).  In many </p><p>of these areas, long deserted by other representatives of </p><p>government authority intimidated by the Maoists, the RNA may </p><p>provide the only contact members of the local population have </p><p>with the government. Karki hypothesized that the Maoists\' </p><p>demand was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to </p><p>obstruct these successful hearts-and-minds programs. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Only after the RNA spokesman went public with the </p><p>Army\'s dissatisfaction did the GON begin to issue </p><p>semi-official disclaimers.  On May 15 the press quoted </p><p>unidentified GON and RNA sources characterizing the </p><p>restriction as no more than a "proposal" tabled during the </p><p>second round.  The Defense Ministry spokesman told us </p><p>privately that the GON was in "confusion" over the issue and </p><p>confirmed that his ministry had received no instructions, </p><p>either written or verbal, limiting RNA movements.  At COB on </p><p>May 15 the Maoists were reportedly holding a closed-door </p><p>meeting at their newly established party headquarters in </p><p>Kathmandu.  We imagine that the RNA\'s hard line--and the </p><p>GON\'s apparent retraction--figure prominently in the </p><p>discussions. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The GON\'s five-day silence on this sensitive subject </p><p>suggests to us that its negotiators did agree to the </p><p>restriction, viewing it as a significant compromise from the </p><p>Maoists\' original insistence that the military not move out </p><p>of barracks at all. The "confusion" over the issue, as the </p><p>Defense Ministry spokesman put it, may be symptomatic of poor </p><p>coordination between the Palace and GON negotiators and an </p><p>overall lack of negotiating expertise.  While the Maoists are </p><p>likely to cast this disagreement as an example of the GON\'s </p><p>"bad faith" or lack of seriousness, we do not believe that </p><p>this dispute will cause a serious rupture that could </p><p>jeopardize the peace process. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
