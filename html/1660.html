(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR JAMES BRUNO; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SESSION EXPECTED TO </p><p>BEGIN MAY 21 OR 22 WILL UNVEIL A NEW ASSEMBLY CHAIRPERSON, </p><p>LIKELY CPV ORGANIZATIONAL CHIEF AN.  IT MAY ALSO GIVE CLUES </p><p>AS TO THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF RISING SOUTHERN REFORMERS </p><p>NGUYEN MINH TRIET AND NGUYEN TAN DUNG, ONE OF WHOM COULD BE </p><p>TELEGRAPHED AS KHAI\'S HEIR APPARENT AS PRIME MINISTER.  A </p><p>HANDFUL OF MINISTERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPLACED, SINCE </p><p>SEVERAL DROPPED FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  THE ROLE OF </p><p>THE PARTY SECRETARIAT WILL ALSO BE CLARIFIED OVER THE NEXT </p><p>MONTHS, AS WE SEE WHETHER TRADE MINISTER VU KHOAN WILL </p><p>RETAIN HIS MINISTRY POST OR PERHAPS BE NAMED AS A DEPUTY PM. </p><p>MORE WIDE-RANGING CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, ARE </p><p>EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE IN JULY 2002 FOLLOWING NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS NEXT SPRING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>AN EXPECTED TO HEAD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BEGINNING IN MAY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IS EXPECTED TO OPEN MAY 21 OR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01020  01 OF 04  271154Z </p><p>22 FOR ITS MONTH-LONG SPRING SESSION, ACCORDING TO A KEY </p><p>SENIOR STAFFER AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (STRICTLY PROTECT). </p><p>THE FULL ASSEMBLY MEMBERSHIP WILL MEET MAY 20 IN AN </p><p>INFORMAL PRE-SESSION TO SET THE AGENDA FOR THE TERM.  (OUR </p><p>CONTACT WOULD NOT CONFIRM POLOFF\'S QUERY THAT ASSEMBLY </p><p>MEMBERS MIGHT BE "BRIEFED" AT THIS TIME ON THE CPV\'S </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>LEADERSHIP CHANGES.)  THE MAIN FORMAL BUSINESS OF THIS </p><p>SPRING SESSION WILL BE LAWMAKING, AND THE ASSEMBLY HAS A </p><p>FULL DOCKET, WITH AMENDMENTS BEING DEBATED TO THE LABOR </p><p>CODE AND THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE, AND NEW LAWS ON </p><p>PRESERVATION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE, FIRE-FIGHTING, AND </p><p>TRAFFIC AND HIGHWAYS.  (NOTE: THE AMENDMENTS TO THE </p><p>CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE, ABOUT WHICH WE WILL REPORT FURTHER </p><p>SEPTEL, WILL CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMITING THE </p><p>ALLOWABLE TIME AND SIMPLIFYING PROCEDURES FOR DETENTION OF </p><p>SUSPECTS, AND SHORTENING THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD </p><p>BEFORE A PERSON MUST GO TO TRIAL AFTER ARREST.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE BIGGEST TOPIC OF INTEREST IN THE MAY-JUNE </p><p>SESSION OF THE ASSEMBLY WILL BE WHICH GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP CHANGES WILL BE ANNOUNCED.  CPV </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL AFFAIRS CHIEF NGUYEN VAN AN, WHO WAS THE </p><p>RUNNER-UP TO NONG DUC MANH FOR GENERAL SECRETARY, IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO BE ELECTED AS MANH\'S SUCCESSOR AT THE ASSEMBLY, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE ASSEMBLY STAFFER.  MANH WILL OPEN THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY SESSION AND PRESIDE OVER THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>STANDING COMMITTEE MEETING PRECEDING IT MAY 14-19, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE STAFFER, AND AN LIKELY WILL BE ELECTED </p><p>"DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE SESSION."  (NOTE: AFTER THE </p><p>STAFFER MET WITH POLOFF APRIL 27, HE WAS GOING TO A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01020  01 OF 04  271154Z </p><p>"FAREWELL MEETING" MANH WAS HAVING WITH HIS LONG-TIME STAFF </p><p>AT THE ASSEMBLY.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) ONE OF THE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MANH\'S </p><p>SUCCESSOR WILL BE PREPARING FOR VIETNAM\'S YEAR-LONG </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE ASEAN INTER-PARLIAMENTARY ORGANIZATION </p><p>(AIPO) BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER.  THIS WILL BE VIETNAM\'S </p><p>FIRST TIME HEADING AIPO, AND LIKE THE COUNTRY\'S INITIAL </p><p>VENTURE INTO THE ASEAN PRESIDENCY, THE ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>DEMANDS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT.  (COMMENT: FROM THIS VANTAGE </p><p>POINT, AN\'S EXPERIENCE HONED OVER THE PAST YEAR IN HIS CPV </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL POST COULD BE A REASON HE WOULD BE TABBED </p><p>FOR THIS JOB.  END COMMENT.) THE CONSTITUENT COMMITTEES OF </p><p>AIPO MEET DURING THE YEAR, CULMINATING IN THE ANNUAL SUMMIT </p><p>TO BE HELD IN HANOI IN SEPTEMBER 2003. </p><p> </p><p>SOME GOVERNMENT CHANGES NOW, MORE NEXT YEAR </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) BECAUSE OF CHANGES MADE IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>RANKINGS ANNOUNCED AT THE CPV CONGRESS, A NUMBER OF </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO BE ANNOUNCED AT THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY.  SOME OF THESE CHANGES APPEAR EVIDENT.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, SEVERAL MINISTERS, SUCH AS THOSE FOR THE </p><p>MINISTRIES OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT (MPI), JUSTICE, </p><p>CONSTRUCTION, INDUSTRY, AND TRANSPORTATION, WERE NOT </p><p>ELECTED TO THE NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE, WHILE THEIR DEPUTIES </p><p>WERE.  THIS CLEARLY PRESAGES THEIR REPLACEMENT, THOUGH SOME </p><p>SOURCES SUGGEST THAT A COUPLE OF THEM MIGHT SURVIVE UNTIL </p><p>2002.  MPI MINISTER GIA, WHO WAS CRITICIZED BY THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE LAST YEAR, REPORTEDLY WILL BE REPLACED.  THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY STAFFER SAYS JUSTICE MINISTER LOC IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>GO TO TAKE A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY POST (LIKELY HEADING THE </p><p>JUSTICE COMMITTEE) WHILE HIS DEPUTY, UONG CHU LUU, MOVES </p><p>UP.  (HE DESCRIBES LUU AS A YOUNGER, IMPRESSIVE LAWYER WHO </p><p>HAS MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF HEADING UP CHANGES TO THE </p><p>CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE.)  INTERESTINGLY, BOTH GIA AND </p><p>MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (MOSTE) NHA, WHO </p><p>NORMALLY ARE AMONG THE MOST SOCIALLY OMNIPRESENT MINISTERS, </p><p>WERE NOT AT THE MANH-HOSTED RECEPTION FOLLOWING HIS </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT APRIL 22. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DEPUTY PM NGUYEN MANH CAM TOLD THE AUSTRALIANS AFTER </p><p>THE PARTY CONGRESS THAT THOUGH HE WAS NO LONGER A MEMBER OF </p><p>THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, HE WOULD NOT RETIRE FROM GOVERNMENT </p><p>UNTIL 2002, FOLLOWING ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AND PROMULGATION </p><p>OF A NEW CONSTITUTION (SEE FURTHER BELOW).  CAM TOLD THE </p><p>AUSTRALIANS HE HOPED FOR VIETNAM TO ENTER THE WTO BEFORE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01020  02 OF 04  271154Z </p><p>HIS RETIREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IN ADDITION, OTHER GOVERNMENT POSTS NEED TO BE </p><p>FILLED.  MINISTER OF CULTURE AND INFORMATION NGUYEN KHOA </p><p>DIEM MOVED UP TO THE POLITBURO, AND HE IS EXPECTED TO HEAD </p><p>UP CPV IDEOLOGICAL AFFAIRS.  MOVING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION, </p><p>MINISTER OF SPORTS HA QUANG DU AND MINISTRY OF ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY AFFAIRS HOANG DUC NGHI WERE CENSURED BY THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND ARE EXPECTED TO RETIRE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) IN THE NEW CENTRAL COMMITTEE LINEUP (WITH 150 SEATS </p><p>AS OPPOSED TO 170), MOST MINISTRIES ARE NOW REPRESENTED BY </p><p>ONLY ONE MEMBER.  DESPITE A DROP IN PRESTIGE AT SENIOR </p><p>LEVELS (WITH ONLY ONE MILITARY MEMBER IN THE POLITBURO), </p><p>DEFENSE RETAINED 10 PERCENT OF THE SEATS IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE (15), WHILE PUBLIC SECURITY (4), AGRICULTURE AND </p><p>RURAL DEVELOPMENT (2), FINANCE (2) AND EDUCATION AND </p><p>TRAINING (2) ALSO HAVE MULTIPLE SEATS.  SOME MINISTRIES ARE </p><p>NOT REPRESENTED IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, INCLUDING MOSTE, </p><p>SPORTS AND MINORITY AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MEMORY </p><p>THAT MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS ONLY ONE FORMAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE, MINISTER NIEN, SINCE VICE MINISTER BIN WAS </p><p>DROPPED.  (HOWEVER, CAREER DIPLOMAT AND CURRENT MINISTER OF </p><p>TRADE VU KHOAN ALSO MAINTAINED HIS SEAT IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE, AND AS NOTED REFTELS, HAS NEW PROMINENCE AND </p><p>CLOUT THROUGH THE CPV SECRETARIAT.)  OUR SOURCES SUGGEST </p><p>BIN WILL RETAIN HIS POSITION AT MFA, INCLUDING HIS ROLE </p><p>DEALING WITH OVERSEAS VIETNAMESE.  BIN\'S DROP FROM THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE MAY BE DUE TO THE TIGHTER "NUMBERS GAME" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01020  02 OF 04  271154Z </p><p>WITH A SMALLER CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  (NOTE: AMBASSADOR TO THE </p><p>U.S. LE BANG, WHO ATTENDED THE CONGRESS, WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL </p><p>IN HIS HOPE TO MAKE THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  DURING THE </p><p>CONGRESS\' CLOSING SESSION HE SAT WITH SOME OTHER DELEGATES </p><p>IN THE BALCONY, WHICH IS WHERE FOREIGN DIPLOMATIC OBSERVERS </p><p>SAT.) </p><p> </p><p>ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS IN 2002 WILL BRING FURTHER CHANGES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) IN LATE APRIL (OR PERHAPS EARLY MAY NEXT YEAR) </p><p>NATION-WIDE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD TO ELECT A NEW 450- </p><p>MEMBER NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR THE BODY\'S 11TH SESSION, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE ASSEMBLY STAFFER WITH WHOM WE SPOKE </p><p>(PROTECT).  THE ELECTION ITSELF WILL BE HELD ON A SUNDAY, </p><p>POSSIBLY APRIL 28, THOUGH THIS WILL BE FINALIZED BY THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY\'S STANDING COMMITTEE LATER THIS YEAR OR EARLY </p><p>NEXT.  THE PRE-ELECTION PERIOD WILL RUN ROUGHLY THREE </p><p>MONTHS, RUNNING FROM FORMAL VETTING OF CANDIDATES BY THE </p><p>VIETNAM FATHERLAND FRONT, CAMPAIGNING IN LOCAL DISTRICTS BY </p><p>CANDIDATES BEFORE SELECTED GROUPS OF VOTERS, AND THEN </p><p>NATION-WIDE BALLOTING IN POLLING STATIONS AROUND THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  THE STAFFER CONFIRMED THE PROCESS WOULD BE </p><p>SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL ELECTIONS OF 18 </p><p>MONTHS AGO, WHICH POLOFFS WITNESSED AT VARIOUS POLLING </p><p>STATIONS (SEPTELS).  (COMMENT: IN THAT BALLOTING, THERE WAS </p><p>NO TRANSPARENCY IN COUNTING AND TALLYING OF VOTES, AND THUS </p><p>NO CHECK ON THE CPV\'S MANIPULATION OF THE FINAL TALLIES.  A </p><p>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL ELECTION RESULTS </p><p>IN HANOI BY EMBOFFS STRONGLY SUGGESTED THE RESULTS WERE </p><p>DOCTORED, GIVEN THE RECURRENT PATTERNS IN VOTE TOTALS IN </p><p>DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) AFTER THE NEW NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IS ELECTED NEXT </p><p>YEAR, IT LIKELY WILL MEET IN ITS FIRST SESSION IN JULY </p><p>2002, ACCORDING TO THE ASSEMBLY STAFFER.  THIS WOULD LIKELY </p><p>BE THE TIME WHEN A NEW PRIME MINISTER WOULD BE NAMED TO </p><p>REPLACE PHAN VAN KHAI.  NUMEROUS SOURCES SUGGEST THAT HCMC </p><p>PARTY BOSS NGUYEN MINH TRIET IS THE LEADING CANDIDATE FOR </p><p>THE POST, GIVEN HIS STRONG SUPPORT AMONG SOUTHERNERS AND </p><p>REFORMERS IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  THE OTHER PROMINENT </p><p>CANDIDATE, ALSO MENTIONED FREQUENTLY, IS FIRST DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER DUNG.  ONE CPV-CONNECTED SOURCE TOLD US DUNG </p><p>LIKELY WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RETIREMENT OF SOME OF THE OLD </p><p>GUARD, INCLUDING SENIOR ADVISORS, AT THE PARTY CONGRESS </p><p>(REFS A AND B).  DUNG REPORTEDLY MADE ENEMIES AMONG SOME OF </p><p>THE OLDER MEMBERS BY HIS "OUTSPOKEN" AND SOMETIMES SOMEWHAT </p><p>"INDEPENDENT" ACTIONS; ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE, DUNG WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01020  03 OF 04  271154Z </p><p>NOT SEEN AS SUFFICIENTLY DEFERENTIAL TO SOME OF THE CPV </p><p>ELDERS.  NOW THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE SENIOR RANK, HE MAY </p><p>FLOURISH.  (NOTE: CPV ECONOMIC COMMISSION CHAIRMAN TRUONG </p><p>TAN SANG ALSO CANNOT BE COUNTED OUT, THOUGH AS REF A NOTED, </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION APPEAR TO HAVE PLACED HIM </p><p>SOMEWHAT ON THE DEFENSIVE FOR THE TIME BEING.) </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) AT THE EXPECTED JULY 2002 ASSEMBLY SESSION, THERE </p><p>ARE EXPECTED TO BE WIDESPREAD CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AS WELL.  THE STAFFER SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>MANH\'S SUCCESSOR AS ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN, PRESUMABLY AN, COULD </p><p>SERVE ONLY ONE YEAR IN THE POST, PERHAPS BEING REPLACED IN </p><p>2002.  AT THAT TIME, NEW STANDING COMMITTEES AND A NEW </p><p>LEADERSHIP LINEUP IN THE ASSEMBLY WOULD BE NAMED. </p><p> </p><p>THE ROLE OF THE SECRETARIAT AND THE CPV INSPECTORATE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) ONE OF THE KEY CHANGES COMING OUT OF THE PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS WAS THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE CPV SECRETARIAT, </p><p>WHICH WILL OVERSEE THE DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS OF THE POLITBURO. </p><p>BASED ON THE MAKE-UP OF THE NEW BODY AND INITIAL REPORTS WE </p><p>HAVE RECEIVED ABOUT ITS FUNCTIONS, THE SECRETARIAT MAY HELP </p><p>IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND WORK OF CPV SENIOR LEADERS.  KEY </p><p>FIGURES TO WATCH IN THE NEWLY RECONSTITUTED SECRETARIAT ARE </p><p>LE HONG ANH, NEW HEAD OF THE CPV\'S INSPECTORATE (CONTROL </p><p>COMMISSION), AND CURRENT TRADE MINISTER VU KHOAN.  PRIOR TO </p><p>1996, WHEN THE SECRETARIAT EXISTED, POLITBURO AND CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO SERVED IN THE BODY DID NOT ALSO HOLD </p><p>GOVERNMENT POSTS, AND THUS THERE IS WIDESPREAD SPECULATION </p><p>THAT VU KHOAN WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP HIS TRADE MINISTER POST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01020  03 OF 04  271154Z </p><p>IN ORDER TO CONCENTRATE ON CPV BUSINESS.  ACCORDING TO THIS </p><p>ARGUMENT, HE ALSO WOULD NOT ASSUME THE DEPUTY PM SLOT THAT </p><p>HAS BEEN REPORTEDLY DISCUSSED FOR HIM.  (THE ABOVE REPORT </p><p>ABOUT CAM MAINTAINING HIS POSITION TO 2002 WOULD TEND TO </p><p>SUPPORT THIS LATTER VIEW.)  A LEADING REFORMER WHO GETS </p><p>RESULTS, VU KHOAN IS SEEN AS ONE OF THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF </p><p>REFORMERS HERE. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) ASSISTANT TRADE MINISTRY LUONG, WHO SERVED AS </p><p>KHOAN\'S CHIEF ADVISOR ON BTA NEGOTIATIONS, TOLD ECONOFF </p><p>THAT KHOAN WOULD OVERSEE AND MANAGE VIETNAM\'S TRADE AND </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY PORTFOLIOS FROM HIS NEW POSITION.  LUONG </p><p>IMPLIED THAT NOT ONLY WOULD KHOAN EFFECTIVELY TAKE OVER DPM </p><p>CAM\'S ENTIRE PORTFOLIO, IF NOT THE FORMAL POSITION AT THIS </p><p>POINT.  HE SAID KHOAN WOULD HAVE AN EVEN HIGHER STATURE AND </p><p>POSITION IN HIS NEW JOB THAN THAT OF A DEPUTY PM.  LUONG </p><p>ALSO MADE CLEAR THERE WAS NO REASON WHY KHOAN COULD NOT </p><p>SERVE IN HIS NEW SECRETARIAT POSITION AND ALSO SERVE  AS </p><p>TRADE MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) THE MEMBERS OF THE SECRETARIAT SEEM CAREFULLY </p><p>BALANCED FOR DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND REGIONS OF THE CPV. </p><p>OF THE FOUR CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS, ONE IS ARMED FORCES </p><p>CHIEF OF STAFF (LE VAN DUNG), TWO ARE CPV CHIEFS FROM </p><p>SOUTHERN DONG THAP AND NORTHERN SON LA PROVINCES (TONG THI </p><p>PHONG AND TRUONG VINH TRONG) AND ONE (VU KHOAN) HAS A </p><p>STRONG BACKGROUND IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE.  OVERALL, </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT IS SEEN AS STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF THE </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY (COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS STANDING BOARD </p><p>OF THE POLITBURO) SINCE THE OTHER EIGHT MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT ARE ALMOST ALL MUCH JUNIOR TO HIM. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) LE HONG ANH, ONLY 51 AND NOW IN THE POLITBURO, IS </p><p>PERHAPS THE BIGGEST "SHOOTING STAR" TO COME OUT OF THE </p><p>CONGRESS.  NAMED NINTH IN THE POLITBURO, AND PROMOTED TO </p><p>HEAD THE CONTROL COMMISSION, ANH HAS MOVED UP RAPIDLY. </p><p>FROM KIEN GIANG PROVINCE IN THE MEKONG DELTA, WE HAVE HEARD </p><p>FROM SEVERAL SOURCES THAT ANH IS A "PROTEGE" OF NGUYEN TAN </p><p>DUNG AND MAY HAVE RIDDEN HIS COATTAILS TO HANOI FIVE YEARS </p><p>AGO.  ANH FOLLOWED DUNG AS PARTY CHIEF IN KIEN GIANG AND </p><p>GAINED GOOD MARKS FOR HIS FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION THERE. </p><p>AS DEPUTY TO MS. XUAN MY ON THE CONTROL COMMISSION SINCE </p><p>1998, ANH MANAGED TO GET POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR HIS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL EFFORTS, THOUGH MY FELL FROM THE POLITBURO </p><p>FOR HER POOR MANAGEMENT OF THE CRITICISM/SELF-CRITICISM </p><p>CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) ANH SEEMS TO BE WELL POSITIONED FOR GREATER HEIGHTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01020  04 OF 04  271155Z </p><p>IF HE PERFORMS WELL.  THE CONTROL COMMISSION HAS A LARGELY </p><p>"INSPECTORATE" ROLE IN THE CPV: IT CHECKS UP ON CPV MEMBER </p><p>AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE, CONSIDERS POSSIBLE </p><p>VIOLATION, SETTLES COMPLAINTS AMONG CPV MEMBERS AND </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, AND CHECKS ON FINANCIAL ISSUES AT LOWER </p><p>LEVELS.  AFTER BEING NAMED GENERAL SECRETARY, MANH STATED </p><p>IN HIS OPENING REMARKS THAT FIGHTING CORRUPTION IS ONE OF </p><p>HIS MAIN PRIORITIES, ALONG WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>THUS, ANH IS IN THE CENTER OF THE ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SESSION NEXT MONTH, WE </p><p>EXPECT TO SEE FURTHER MANIFESTATIONS OF THE GENERATIONAL </p><p>CHANGE SEEN DRAMATICALLY AT THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS.  THAT </p><p>PROCESS WILL PLAY ITSELF OUT MORE FULLY THROUGH THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR AND THE LIKELY PROMOTION OF </p><p>EITHER TRIET OR DUNG TO BE THE NEW HEAD OF GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>2002.  OVER TIME, THIS PROCESS OF GENERATIONAL CHANGE WILL </p><p>HAVE RIPPLING EFFECTS THAT WE EXPECT WILL RESHAPE </p><p>VIETNAMESE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LIFE.  IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>RECONSTITUTED SECRETARIAT, WITH A PROMINENT ROLE PLAYED BY </p><p>VU KHOAN AS A VIRTUAL POLITBURO CHIEF OF STAFF, INDEED </p><p>COULD BODE WELL FOR IMPROVED EFFICIENCY IN CPV DECISION- </p><p>MAKING AND A MORE VIGOROUS COMMITMENT TO REFORM.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
