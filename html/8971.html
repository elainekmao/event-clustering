SUMMARY: Following is the UAE\'s country strategy for MEPI, </p><p>which has been developed by PA and coordinated with POL and ECON. </p><p>This includes long-term goals, specific objectives, suggested </p><p>mechanisms by which goals could be realized, and a request for </p><p>funding for two UAE-specific projects. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. Economic reform: </p><p> </p><p>GOAL: Enhance the UAE\'s global competitiveness through support </p><p>for its integration into the global economy: </p><p> </p><p>Objectives: Assist the UAEG to comply with its WTO obligations </p><p>and to actively participate in WTO fora; support trade-related </p><p>institution-building; </p><p> </p><p>Mechanisms: Conduct targeted WTO seminars and training; </p><p> </p><p>GOAL: Judicial Reform: Foster transparency and consistency in </p><p>legal proceedings and rendition of judgments; </p><p> </p><p>Objectives:  Educate UAE judges and prosecutors on more efficient </p><p>court administration and case management and sensitize them on </p><p>key legal issues, including prevailing norms on protection of </p><p>intellectual property rights; </p><p> </p><p>Mechanisms: Encourage active participation by Ministry of Justice </p><p>officials and judges in the future Judicial Training Institute in </p><p>Manama; encourage attendance by high-level MOJ officials at the </p><p>upcoming Judicial Reform Forum in Manama; invite MOJ officials to </p><p>attend IV programs on court administration and case management; </p><p>engage with MOJ\'s Judicial Training Institute, Dubai Justice </p><p>Department\'s Judicial Training Institute and the UAE Jurists </p><p>Association on possible training or exchanges. </p><p> </p><p>GOAL:  Address looming problem of unemployment among young </p><p>nationals, which has negative implications for national </p><p>stability; </p><p> </p><p>Objectives: Foster entrepreneurship among nationals, especially </p><p>women; </p><p> </p><p>Mechanisms: Support existing and future programs to train </p><p>nationals for private sector employment; Support existing women\'s </p><p>business associations and programs that provide practical skills </p><p>training and foster entrepreneurship among women; establish Arab </p><p>Businesswomen or US-UAE Businesswomen network or mentoring </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Political Reform: </p><p> </p><p>GOAL:  Encourage broader political participation, particularly by </p><p>women, and strengthen civil society. </p><p> </p><p>Objectives: Expand and strengthen the role of NGOs and the media </p><p>sector in the UAE; support training for members of the Federal </p><p>National Council (FNC) and the elected councils in Dubai which </p><p>will serve as the grassroots model for broader political </p><p>participation in the UAE; enhance the professionalism and </p><p>independence of both local and regional media in the UAE, which </p><p>is fast becoming a major regional media hub; </p><p> </p><p>Mechanisms: We recommend initiatives, particularly regional </p><p>projects, directed to women and NGOS through such tools as </p><p>citizens\' exchanges, International visitor programs, and programs </p><p>such as MEET.  We also recommend that MEPI look to organize </p><p>training workshops for media. Post has conducted some recently </p><p>with great success. Journalists here welcome the opportunity to </p><p>improve their skills and professionalism. Dubai represents an </p><p>excellent location in which to conduct such workshops for the </p><p>entire region. </p><p> </p><p>SPECIFIC PROJECT REQUEST: The appointed Federal National Council </p><p>has requested that we organize a visit to the US in October 2003 </p><p>for eight persons, four FNC members and four staffers, to learn </p><p>about the operation of federal and state legislatures. This is an </p><p>unprecedented request and would provide an opening to strengthen </p><p>the role of the FNC as an advocacy body for public concerns. </p><p>Post requests that the MEPI office arrange for a US-based </p><p>organization to take on the logistical and planning arrangements </p><p>for this project.  We note that this is an unprecedented </p><p>opportunity to effect some change in the traditionally static </p><p>FNC. A proposal will be sent septel. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Education Reform: </p><p> </p><p>GOAL:  Help the UAE modernize its education system and curricula. </p><p> </p><p>Objectives: Train a work force with skills applicable to today\'s </p><p>job market; Help the UAE promote an atmosphere of tolerance and </p><p>moderation in its school curricula and system; </p><p> </p><p>Mechanisms: Curriculum revision and updating; Teacher training, </p><p>including training for teachers on how to teach revised </p><p>curricula, how to employ critical thinking and IT in the </p><p>classroom; English language training for teachers in K-12; </p><p>Accreditation: how to set standards for accreditation. (NOTE: </p><p>Because of its multi-cultural population, the UAE has at least 16 </p><p>different kinds of school systems. US accreditation standards are </p><p>of particular interest and importance here. END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>SPECIFIC PROJECT REQUEST:  Post requests a grant of $41,000 to </p><p>award locally to Zayed University\'s School for the Professional </p><p>Development of UAE Educators to conduct workshops for UAE </p><p>educators to improve the teaching methodology of national </p><p>teachers in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  A more detailed proposal will </p><p>be sent septel. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT and REQUEST:  As MEPI has begun to take shape, and we </p><p>have had time to reflect upon how we might best apply it here, we </p><p>have come to the realization that our strategy must be two- </p><p>pronged: both regional and local. Post will participate in the </p><p>many regional programs - both MEPI and P4L - now underway or in </p><p>planning. There are however, many opportunities which offer </p><p>themselves within the UAE which we cannot take advantage of </p><p>without access to direct and flexible funding. In the last six </p><p>months, we have reached out to a wide range of UAE institutions </p><p>to seek them as partners and stakeholders with us in implementing </p><p>MEPI projects. These include the universities, the ministries, </p><p>the Emirates News Agency, judicial training institutes, and </p><p>others. We seek to empower these local partners and to draw them </p><p>fully into the MEPI process, and they are eager to participate. </p><p>They alone have the expertise to reach deep into the local </p><p>community and engage a wider range of Emiratis.  Post requests </p><p>therefore that a small-grants program be added to the MEPI </p><p>arsenal of tools available to us, grants of up to $50,000 or </p><p>$100,000 which can be awarded by posts through an agreed-upon </p><p>mechanism. All PAOs have grant authority which would allow them </p><p>to draft and issue grants at post. END COMMENT and REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
