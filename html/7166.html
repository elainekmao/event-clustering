<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIJING 003947 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, CH, TW </p><p>SUBJECT: TAIWAN: CHINA\'S NEW LEADERSHIP TO CONTINUE </p><p>"MODERATE" APPROACH </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIJING 3082 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JON </p><p>ALOISI.  REASONS: 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) A PROMINENT PRC ANALYST TOLD US HE EXPECTS </p><p>BEIJING\'S POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN TO SHOW CONTINUITY, WITH </p><p>THE NEW LEADERSHIP CONTINUING TO PURSUE A RELATIVELY </p><p>MODERATE APPROACH FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING ECONOMIC AND </p><p>OTHER UNOFFICIAL LINKS.  OUR CONTACT SUGGESTED THAT THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF HU JINTAO\'S MARCH 11 SPEECH TO THE NPC </p><p>TAIWAN DELEGATION WAS THE WAY HE PACKAGED TOGETHER A </p><p>NUMBER OF MODERATE POINTS, EACH OF WHICH HAD BEEN MADE </p><p>BEFORE BUT SEPARATELY RATHER THAN TOGETHER.  BASED ON </p><p>HIS ANALYSIS OF TAIWAN\'S POLITICAL DYNAMICS, THE ANALYST </p><p>WAS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>OPENING DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORTATION LINKS.  HIS </p><p>THINKING CLOSELY TRACKS WITH THAT OF OTHER KNOWLEDGEABLE </p><p>EMBASSY CONTACTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) GUO ZHENYUAN, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE MFA- </p><p>AFFILIATED CHINA INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, </p><p>RECENTLY DISCUSSED WITH US CROSS-STRAIT DEVELOPMENTS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE TAIWAN POLICY OF BEIJING\'S NEW LEADERSHIP. </p><p>GIVEN PRC POLITICAL DYNAMICS, GUO EXPLAINED, THERE WILL </p><p>BE A HIGH DEGREE OF CONTINUITY IN POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN </p><p>DESPITE THE CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP.  IN ONE SENSE, PARTY </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY HU JINTAO\'S MARCH 11 "IMPORTANT </p><p>SPEECH" ON TAIWAN POLICY TO THE NATIONAL PEOPLE\'S </p><p>CONGRESS "TAIWAN DELEGATION" CONTAINED NOTHING NEW, GUO </p><p>SAID.  EACH OF THE POINTS MADE BY HU HAS BEEN STATED </p><p>SEPARATELY IN THE PAST BY VARIOUS CHINESE LEADERS AND </p><p>OFFICIALS.  WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT HU\'S MARCH 11 REMARKS, </p><p>GUO STRESSED, IS THE WAY HE PACKAGED TOGETHER FOR THE </p><p>FIRST TIME WHAT ARE BEING CALLED THE "FOUR POINTS" AND </p><p>"THREE WHATEVERS" OF HIS TAIWAN POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, DURING HIS MARCH 11 </p><p>REMARKS HU JINTAO DISCUSSED "TAIWAN WORK UNDER THE NEW </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES."  HU\'S "FOUR POINTS" ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- ALWAYS ADHERE TO THE ONE-CHINA PRINCIPLE; </p><p> </p><p>-- SPARE NO EFFORTS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL </p><p>EXCHANGES ACROSS THE TAIWAN STRAIT; </p><p> </p><p>-- FURTHER IMPLEMENT THE PRINCIPLE OF PLACING HOPES ON </p><p>THE TAIWAN PEOPLE; AND, </p><p> </p><p>-- UNITE COMPATRIOTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TAIWAN STRAIT </p><p>TO JOINTLY PUSH FORWARD THE GREAT REJUVENATION OF THE </p><p>CHINESE NATION. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO HU\'S "THREE WHATEVERS," BEIJING SHOULD </p><p>SPARE NO EFFORT IN DOING WHATEVER BENEFITS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE INTERESTS OF THE TAIWAN PEOPLE; </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UNIFICATION OF THE MOTHERLAND; AND, </p><p> </p><p>-- THE "GREAT REJUVENATION" OF THE CHINESE NATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN HIS FIRST MAJOR STATEMENT ON TAIWAN POLICY, </p><p>HU CLOSELY FOLLOWED AND ENDORSED THE LINE SET BY JIANG </p><p>ZEMIN, BUT ALSO PUT HIS PERSONAL STAMP ON POLICY BY </p><p>PACKAGING HIS MESSAGE IN A NEW WAY.  CHINESE MEDIA </p><p>CHARACTERIZED HU\'S REMARKS AS MODERATE AND CONCILIATORY, </p><p>FOCUSING ON POSITIVE THEMES SUCH AS INCREASING ECONOMIC </p><p>AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES, HELPING TAIWAN INVESTORS, </p><p>PROMOTING DIRECT TRANSPORTATION LINKS, AND EXCHANGING </p><p>VIEWS WITH PARTIES AND PERSONALITIES IN VARIOUS CIRCLES </p><p>FROM TAIWAN.  ACCORDING TO GUO, THE MODERATION EVIDENT </p><p>IN HU\'S REMARKS WAS A GOODWILL GESTURE TO TAIWAN.  IN </p><p>ONE PHRASE EMPHASIZING THE SHARED INTERESTS OF TAIWAN </p><p>AND THE MAINLAND, HU STATED THAT "CHINA BELONGS TO </p><p>COMPATRIOTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STRAIT AND IS OUR </p><p>COMMON HOMELAND."  PREMIER WEN JIABAO ECHOED THE SAME </p><p>THEME IN HIS MARCH 19 PRESS CONFERENCE (REFTEL), QUOTING </p><p>A POEM IN WHICH A DECEASED KMT VETERAN HAD DESCRIBED HIS </p><p>LONGING FOR HIS HOMETOWN ON THE MAINLAND. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) GUO ACKNOWLEDGED OUR OBSERVATION THAT HU JINTAO </p><p>NOW APPEARS TO BE IN CHARGE OF TAIWAN POLICY AND THAT </p><p>ZENG QINGHONG ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE A PROMINENT ROLE.  GUO </p><p>VOLUNTEERED THAT JIANG ZEMIN IS STILL INFLUENTIAL ON THE </p><p>ISSUE.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT OFFICIALS BELOW THE TOP </p><p>LEADERSHIP INVOLVED IN TAIWAN AFFAIRS, GUO CITED STATE </p><p>COUNCIL TAIWAN AFFAIRS OFFICE (TAO) DIRECTOR CHEN </p><p>YUNLIN, ADDING THAT HE HAD NOT HEARD OF ANY CHANGES </p><p>BEING MADE IN THE TAO LINEUP.  COMMENT: GUO\'S REMARKS </p><p>TRACK GENERALLY WITH RECENT PRESS REPORTS THAT SUGGEST </p><p>HU JINTAO AND ZENG QINGHONG HAVE SUCCEEDED JIANG ZEMIN </p><p>AND QIAN QICHEN AS DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S TAIWAN AFFAIRS LEADING GROUP. </p><p>OTHER KNOWLEDGEABLE EMBASSY CONTACTS ALSO AGREE ON THIS </p><p>LINEUP.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) GUO WAS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR A </p><p>BREAKTHROUGH ON THE OPENING OF DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT </p><p>TRANSPORTATION LINKS PRIOR TO THE MARCH 2004 TAIWAN </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  ACCORDING TO GUO\'S ANALYSIS, </p><p>CHEN SHUI-BIAN IS UNLIKELY TO OPEN DIRECT LINKS AT THIS </p><p>TIME BECAUSE HE CALCULATES THE MOVE WOULD COST HIM </p><p>POLITICAL SUPPORT FROM "INDEPENDENCE FUNDAMENTALISTS," </p><p>WHILE CREDIT WOULD GO TO OPPOSITION POLITICIANS RATHER </p><p>THAN HIMSELF.  GUO SUGGESTED THAT IT IS STILL TOO EARLY </p><p>TO PREDICT ELECTION TRENDS AND THAT, AS INCUMBENT </p><p>PRESIDENT, CHEN SHUI-BIAN IS STRONGER POLITICALLY THAN </p><p>IN 2000.  IF THE LIEN/SOONG TICKET WINS, GUO PREDICTED, </p><p>CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS WOULD BE MORE STABLE BECAUSE LIEN </p><p>WOULD BE MORE POSITIVE TOWARD DIRECT LINKS.  GUO ALSO </p><p>STATED THAT LIEN "ACCEPTS" THE 1992 CONSENSUS ON ONE </p><p>CHINA AND PREDICTS HE WOULD NOT, IF ELECTED, SUGGEST </p><p>COMPETING CONSTRUCTS SUCH AS "ONE COUNTRY ON EACH SIDE." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE NEW CHINESE LEADERSHIP WANTS TO KEEP THE </p><p>CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONSHIP ON ITS CURRENT RELATIVELY </p><p>STABLE COURSE, HOPING THAT ECONOMIC AND OTHER UNOFFICIAL </p><p>LINKS WILL WORK TO BRING THE TWO SIDES TOGETHER.  RECENT </p><p>CONCRETE SIGNS OF A RELATIVELY POSITIVE APPROACH BY </p><p>BEIJING INCLUDE ITS APPROVAL FOR TAIWAN AIRLINES TO FLY </p><p>THROUGH PRC AIRSPACE DURING THE IRAQ WAR AND THE PLA\'S </p><p>PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF WITHDRAWING </p><p>MISSILES FROM AREAS OPPOSITE TAIWAN.  DESPITE ITS </p><p>RELATIVELY POSITIVE APPROACH, BEIJING REMAINS "VIGILANT" </p><p>TO TRY TO HEAD OFF POSSIBLE MOVES BY TAIWAN THAT COULD </p><p>"FORCE" IT TO REACT IN WAYS LIKELY TO HAVE DAMAGING SIDE </p><p>EFFECTS.  SPECIFIC PRC CONCERNS INCLUDE "BREAKTHROUGHS" </p><p>BY TAIWAN IN MILITARY RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES </p><p>AND U.S. VISITS BY SENIOR TAIWAN LEADERS.  CURRENT </p><p>CRITICISM OF TAIWAN LEADERS OVER THE PRC\'S MISHANDLING </p><p>OF SARS COULD ALSO SPARK A NEGATIVE REACTION FROM </p><p>BEIJING, ESPECIALLY IF MAINLAND CRITICS PICK UP THE </p><p>CALL. </p><p> </p><p>RANDT </p><p></p></div>
