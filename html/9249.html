Jeter; For Reasons 1.5 (B) </p><p>and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) accepted </p><p>the GON\'s 34 naira (23 cents) fuel price offer early this </p><p>morning.  With this, Labor\'s eight-day strike has ended, one </p><p>day after the most violent twenty-four hours of the strike. </p><p>Five to ten demonstrators were reportedly killed in Lagos </p><p>yesterday, with hundreds injured and jailed.  The end came </p><p>after an all-night session that Labor sources described as </p><p>"lengthy debate and arm twisting from the Senate President </p><p>and Speaker of the House."  Both sides appeared concerned </p><p>that a prolonged strike would incite further violence. </p><p>However, the NLC vowed it would resume the strike if the GON </p><p>refused to pay workers who honored the strike or failed to </p><p>investigate strike-related killings.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Labor\'s eight-day strike ended at 0600 July 8, when </p><p>the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) agreed to the Government\'s </p><p>34 naira/liter (23 cents) offer.  Following what has been the </p><p>most violent day of the strike, the agreement caught some by </p><p>surprise.  We expect neither Abuja nor Nigeria as a whole to </p><p>rebound immediately.  Businesses remained closed today.  The </p><p>lack of fuel will likely delay Nigeria\'s return to normalcy </p><p>for two or three days as deliveries begin to arrive </p><p>throughout the country.  Meanwhile, an official at the </p><p>Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation stated the Petroleum </p><p>Products Pricing Regulatory Agency would officially announce </p><p>the new price today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The Monday activity which brought the strike to a </p><p>close included widespread demonstrations in Lagos, Abeokuta, </p><p>Suleja, Lokoja and other locations.  NLC leaders claimed that </p><p>at least 10 people died in Lagos during the final day of the </p><p>strike.  Along with the 10 previously reported deaths in </p><p>Abuja and three reported deaths in Port Harcourt, the toll </p><p>may be at least 23 persons.  Hundreds have been injured </p><p>(including the victims of the Abuja Wuse Market stampede) and </p><p>many labor and student leaders were detained.  We have not </p><p>heard whether those still under detention have been released. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Labor leaders said that the agreement came after a </p><p>ten-hour session and "arm-twisting" by government officials, </p><p>including Senate President Adolphus Wabara and Speaker of the </p><p>House Aminu Masari.  One member of the NLC\'s National </p><p>Executive Council told Poloff that the stridency of the </p><p>protests had "surprised and worried" labor leaders.  However, </p><p>the NLC warned that it would resume the strike if workers who </p><p>stayed home were not paid and if the police do not </p><p>investigate the killings that occurred during the </p><p>demonstrations around the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: The strike has ended with few people </p><p>satisfied but with just about everyone feeling a sense of </p><p>relief.  Right now, it is difficult to gauge winners and </p><p>losers.  Labor proved its muscle by dragging the strike out </p><p>for nine days but still agreed to a 30 percent price </p><p>increase.  The GON also won an increase in prices, but below </p><p>the 35 naira level it argued was the minimum to spur further </p><p>fuel imports and thus ease the country\'s shortage.  In the </p><p>wake of yesterday\'s violence, both sides were anxious to end </p><p>the strike before more potential violence spread further. </p><p>However, this may not be the final chapter.  The GON wants </p><p>fuel prices to reach 40 naira by year\'s end.  Given the </p><p>lesson of the strike, perhaps the Government will do a better </p><p>job of consulting with Labor the next time around.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
