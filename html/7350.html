(U) Summary: UNOCHA hosted an NGO/IO coordination meeting </p><p>on 9 April in Ankara.  UNOCHA, UNHCR, IFRC, the American Red </p><p>Cross, ten NGOs and DART Field Office/North attended.  UNHCR </p><p>reported no refugee movements in the region.  As a result, </p><p>the GOT Crisis Center and the Turkish Red Crescent Society </p><p>(Kizilay) are scaling back their operations in southeastern </p><p>Turkey.  UNSECOORD has received GOT permission, in principle, </p><p>to enter northern Iraq from Turkey to conduct a security </p><p>assessment.  There has been increased movement of WFP food </p><p>shipments from Turkey to northern Iraq.  NGOs continue to </p><p>await permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) </p><p>to transit Turkey to work in northern Iraq.  Reports from </p><p>northern Iraq indicate that food and non-food items are </p><p>available but at increased costs.  Health care and other </p><p>essential services continue to be provided.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>UN Update </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) UNHCR deputy representative reported that there have </p><p>been no major or minor refugee movements in the region, but </p><p>that UNHCR remains in the preparedness mode.  The deputy </p><p>representative noted that it was not until day 39 of the 1991 </p><p>war that refugee flows began.  He expressed ongoing concern </p><p>for the situation, citing Kurdish movements toward Mosul and </p><p>Kirkuk as possible triggers for large movements of Iraqis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The lack of movement of refugees into Turkey has </p><p>caused the GOT to re-evaluate its Silopi operation and move </p><p>items to Diyarbakir.  The GOT is also reassessing the Crisis </p><p>Center in Diyarbakir.  UNOCHA reported that the Center </p><p>remains on standby with a scaled-down presence.  Kizilay has </p><p>reduced its staff in southeastern Turkey by 160.  There are </p><p>now 120 Kizilay staff members present in that region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) MFA has accepted, in principle, UNSECOORD,s request </p><p>to transit Turkey to conduct a security assessment in </p><p>northern Iraq.  Clearance is still needed from UN offices in </p><p>New York and Larnaca, UNOCHA reported.  Two teams are </p><p>prepared to begin the assessment in northern Iraq when these </p><p>clearances are received. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Since 30 March more that 100 WFP-contracted trucks </p><p>have transited into northern Iraq, carrying mostly wheat </p><p>flour to Dohuk, Arbil and Sulaimaniyah.  UNJLC reported that </p><p>an average of 250 trucks per day would be required to meet </p><p>future plans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>NGO Issues </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Some NGOs remain on standby in Ankara awaiting MFA </p><p>permission to transit Turkey to work in Iraq.  There has been </p><p>no formal notification from the MFA.  Two NGO representatives </p><p>will depart Turkey on 10 April; one will leave a local </p><p>representative to monitor the MFA request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) ID cards and coordination inside of Iraq remain </p><p>issues for NGOs.  NGOs do not want to use U.S. </p><p>military-issued ID cards.  They recognize the importance of </p><p>IDs but favor using their own organizations, cards.  NGOs </p><p>are also concerned about coordination of humanitarian </p><p>assistance inside Iraq.  They are unsure of how they will </p><p>interact with the UN, the U.S. military and other </p><p>coordinating bodies, e.g., ORHA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Those NGOs remaining in Turkey are committed to </p><p>working with the GOT to get formal permission to transit </p><p>Turkey to work in Iraq.  Three NGOs: the American Refugee </p><p>Committee, Shelter for Life and Counterpart International </p><p>submitted requests for transit permits to the MFA during the </p><p>week of 6 April.  Eight NGOs have now requested transit </p><p>permits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Northern Iraq Update </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>9. (U) UNOPS has completed an IDP survey in the </p><p>Kurdish-controlled region of Iraq.  They report that there </p><p>are now 266,000 displaced persons in the region. </p><p>10. (U) UNOCHA reported that the old Iraqi dinar has </p><p>appreciated by 40 percent.  Food costs are increasing by </p><p>50-100 percent, but shops are open.  Non-food items remain </p><p>available, but there is a shortage of shelter material.  This </p><p>shortage could be problematic if there is an influx of IDPs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Health services continue to function, and </p><p>UN-sponsored vaccination programs, e.g., measles, are ongoing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Fuel continues to be imported to Sulaimaniyah and </p><p>Arbil from Iran.  There have been no shipments from </p><p>GOI-controlled areas since the war began. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Power lines from Mosul to the Kurdish-controlled </p><p>region of Iraq have been damaged in recent fighting.  Power </p><p>continues to be supplied, but the cost of power has increased. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Further Meetings </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) The next NGO/IO coordination meeting will be held at </p><p>UN House in Ankara on 16 April at 1400 hrs.  DART Field </p><p>Office/North will attend. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
