<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 000600 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W AND EB/TPP </p><p>SATE PASS USTR </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA/MAC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: TARIFF AND BAN INFORMATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: USDOC 00785 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Introduction and Comment </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>1. Mission provides the following clarifications on </p><p>GON trade policy measures as requested by reftel. </p><p>Mission understands that Washington agencies will use </p><p>this information to prepare a formal high-level </p><p>demarche to deliver to the GON. The timing of the </p><p>demarche will be key to its effectiveness. To a large </p><p>degree, the recent protectionism has been a product of </p><p>electoral politics as the GON seeks the support of </p><p>important business constituencies. GON officials will </p><p>be pre-occupied with the election until the April 19 </p><p>polls; delivering a demarche before then likely will </p><p>be ineffective and unproductive. While the campaign is </p><p>in full pitch, arguments for freer trade and tariff </p><p>reduction will be overshadowed by electoral </p><p>considerations, which usually favor protection. We </p><p>suggest that the demarche be post-election, preferably </p><p>right after the new government is inaugurated. End </p><p>Introduction and Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mosquito Nets </p><p>------------- </p><p>2. Trade Measure: 40 percent tariff. (2003 Fiscal </p><p>Policy Measures and Tariff Amendments, February 25, </p><p>2003) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: In April 2000, President Obasanjo hosted </p><p>the first African Summit on Roll Back Malaria. Along </p><p>with 32 other African Chiefs of State, he promised to </p><p>reduce taxes and tariffs on mosquito nets and related </p><p>goods. The GON reduced the tariff on mosquito nets (HS </p><p>code 6304.9100-9900) to 5 percent in the 2001 Fiscal </p><p>Policy Measures and Tariff Amendments, January 4, </p><p>2001. In contrast, all other textile imports were </p><p>subject to a 50 percent duty. The 2002 tariff schedule </p><p>increased the tariff for all fabrics to 75 percent, </p><p>without including the exception for mosquito netting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On February 14, Ambassador Jeter wrote the President, </p><p>reiterating an earlier request to eliminate the tariff </p><p>on mosquito netting and related goods, in line with </p><p>the President\'s April 2000 commitment. On February 16, </p><p>the Ambassador raised the issue directly with </p><p>President Obasanjo, who said the tariff would be </p><p>removed immediately. However, the 2003 tariff </p><p>schedule--approved at a meeting of the Federal </p><p>Executive Council subsequent to the Ambassador\'s </p><p>conversation with Obasanjo--incorporated only a </p><p>partial reduction of the tariff, to 40 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: There are no known U.S. </p><p>exports of mosquito netting to Nigeria. However, from </p><p>a public health perspective, this high tariff damages </p><p>important USG goals to support economic and social </p><p>(health care) development in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pharmaceuticals </p><p>--------------- </p><p>3. Trade Measures: Ban on imports of pharmaceuticals </p><p>via land borders. Imports are allowed only through </p><p>Calabar and Apapa seaports and Lagos and Kano </p><p>airports. (2003 Fiscal Policy Measures and Tariff </p><p>Amendments, February 25, 2003) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: Counterfeit drugs are widely available </p><p>throughout Nigeria and pose a major public health </p><p>hazard. There are frequent reports of deaths and </p><p>illnesses caused by counterfeit drugs. The ban on </p><p>overland trade is an attempt to reduce the </p><p>availability of substandard drugs smuggled in from </p><p>neighboring states. It is unclear whether this ban </p><p>will be properly enforced. History suggests it might </p><p>not be. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: U.S. pharmaceutical companies </p><p>exporting to Nigeria do not typically use land routes. </p><p>Most land-border imports of pharmaceuticals are </p><p>substandard or counterfeit products entering through </p><p>the Republic of Benin. They are smuggled in order to </p><p>avoid paying duties or securing National Agency for </p><p>Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) </p><p>approval. As such, this ban is not expected to </p><p>substantially impact U.S. exports of legitimate </p><p>pharmaceuticals to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Trade Measure: All locally made and imported </p><p>pharmaceuticals must be registered with National </p><p>Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control </p><p>(NAFDAC). The registration process appears relatively </p><p>straightforward and forms are readily available, but </p><p>there is a registration fee of 1,000,000 naira </p><p>(approximately $8,000) for imported over-the-counter </p><p>drugs and 250,000 naira (approximately $2,000) for </p><p>prescription medicines. The fee for locally made </p><p>drugs, over-the-counter and prescription, is 75,000 </p><p>naira (approximately $600). Registration is valid for </p><p>five years. (National Agency for Food and Drug </p><p>Administration and Control Tariff Charges Regulations </p><p>2001, January 2, 2002) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: This registration process replaces one </p><p>dating from 1994. There is little information </p><p>available about the previous process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: Local importers of </p><p>prescription drugs report that they have already </p><p>complied with NAFDAC registration requirements and </p><p>that they do not find the requirements onerous. From a </p><p>trade policy perspective, registration fees are </p><p>relatively low but the lack of national treatment is </p><p>potentially problematic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fruit Juice </p><p>----------- </p><p>5. Trade Measure: Fruit juice may be imported in bulk </p><p>concentrate form only. (2003 Fiscal Policy Measures </p><p>and Tariff Amendments, February 25, 2003) The ban </p><p>includes fruit flavored drinks, non-alcoholic wines, </p><p>and flavored yogurt drinks. (NAFDAC letter, March 3, </p><p>2003) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: Information Minister Jerry Gana announced </p><p>on January 29 that Nigeria\'s Federal Cabinet would ban </p><p>the import of fruit juices in retail packs effective </p><p>immediately. Gana continued: "Juices to be imported </p><p>into the country must be in drums and must be </p><p>processed in the country to generate income and </p><p>employment. Packaged fruit juices imported into the </p><p>country will be destroyed at the point of entry unless </p><p>the consignment is in drums." Industry sources </p><p>indicate that the ban aims to protect local producers </p><p>and a few importers of juice concentrates. The ban is </p><p>confirmed in the 2003 tariff schedule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: Nigeria\'s overall import </p><p>figures are not readily available; however, import </p><p>demand increased markedly over the past four years. </p><p>The ban has cut off growing U.S. exports of fruit </p><p>juices to Nigeria, which totaled $304,000 (U.S. trade </p><p>data) last fiscal year. However, U.S. market share in </p><p>this hundred million dollar-plus sector remains small. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sugar </p><p>----- </p><p>6. Trade Measure: 30 percent tariff and 5 percent </p><p>sugar development levy on sugar. (Nigeria Customs </p><p>Service Circular, February 6, 2003) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: The Nigeria Customs Service issued a </p><p>circular January 15, 2003 increasing the duty on </p><p>imported sugar (H.S. Codes 1702.1100 - 9900 and </p><p>1701.1100 - 9900) from 15 percent to 50 percent. This </p><p>duty was reduced to 30 percent within weeks, after </p><p>lobbying by domestic interests. An additional 5 </p><p>percent sugar development levy remains in force. The </p><p>effective duty rate is more than 40 percent when port </p><p>surcharges and other tax assessments are included. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: The United States does not </p><p>export sugar. Coca-Cola Nigeria, a franchisee of the </p><p>U.S. company, reports the increase has significantly </p><p>raised its costs, but is unable to provide data. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Detergent </p><p>--------- </p><p>7. Trade Measure: 100 percent tariff on detergents. </p><p>(2002 Fiscal Policy Measures and Tariff Amendments, </p><p>March 21, 2002) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: Domestic manufacturers of detergent </p><p>pressured the GON to increase detergent tariffs in </p><p>2002 to 100 percent. According to Proctor & Gamble </p><p>(P&G), this undermined a commitment it believed it had </p><p>from the GON to maintain detergent tariffs at 40 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: P&G Nigeria--a joint venture </p><p>with the U.S. company--imports Ariel detergent from </p><p>sources outside the United States, so U.S. exports are </p><p>not affected by this tariff. However, the company </p><p>claims that profits from the import of Ariel were to </p><p>be a substantial component of a $10 million investment </p><p>in a diaper factory that began operating in 2002 and a </p><p>$4 million facility to manufacture feminine pads, </p><p>which is currently under construction. The viability </p><p>of the two projects is questionable if profits from </p><p>Ariel can no longer be realized and included in the </p><p>financial investment package. The company points out </p><p>that its import duty payments on Ariel have risen from </p><p>$4.0 to $5.0 million a year while sales of Ariel have </p><p>dropped 25 percent. P&G is interested in building a </p><p>detergent factory in Nigeria and has written to the </p><p>GON pledging to construct the factory if detergent </p><p>duties were to be reduced to 20 percent until 2005. </p><p>The company says that an investment plan worth $40 </p><p>million over three years is at stake. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Poultry </p><p>------- </p><p>8. Trade Measure: Frozen poultry imports are banned. </p><p>(2003 Fiscal Policy Measures and Tariff Amendments, </p><p>February 25, 2003) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: To revive its poultry sector, the GON </p><p>banned poultry imports in August 2002. Before the ban, </p><p>virtually all imported frozen poultry entered Nigeria </p><p>illegally to evade the 75 percent tariff. Nigeria\'s </p><p>poultry production does not meet demand, and industry </p><p>sources estimate its undocumented imports of frozen </p><p>poultry at approximately 25,000 metric tons/year, </p><p>about 20 percent of national consumption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: Without a ban, U.S. exports </p><p>would meet about 40 percent of the 25,000 metric ton </p><p>deficit, at an estimated value of about $6 million. </p><p>Some U.S. poultry is likely still being imported </p><p>illegally, just as it was prior to the ban. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sorghum, Millet, and Cassava </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>9. Trade Measure: Sorghum and millet imports are </p><p>banned. (GON Import Prohibition List, 1998) Cassava </p><p>imports are banned. (2003 Fiscal Policy Measures and </p><p>Tariff Amendments, February 25, 2003) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: Sorghum, millet, and cassava are crops </p><p>important to subsistence farming in Nigeria and the </p><p>GON has banned their import for many years. Nigeria </p><p>has plans to be a major cassava exporter. (Cassava is </p><p>used for tapioca pudding and industrial starch.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: The ban is believed to have a </p><p>minimal impact on U.S. exports of sorghum and millet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Vegetable Oil </p><p>------------- </p><p>10. Trade Measure: Imports of food-grade vegetable oil </p><p>in bulk are banned. (2002 Fiscal Policy Measures and </p><p>Tariff Amendments, March 21, 2002) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: Vegetable oil imported in retail packs </p><p>faces a 60 percent tariff. GON trade officials </p><p>complained that bulk food grade oil imports were being </p><p>passed off as industrial grade, thus paying a lower </p><p>duty. These officials claim that banning bulk imports </p><p>of food grade oil makes the tariff easier to enforce. </p><p>However, industry sources say that raw and refined </p><p>palm oil is smuggled from Malaysia in bulk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: The United States exports </p><p>soybean oil to Nigeria in retail packs. We have </p><p>insufficient information on local demand for vegetable </p><p>oils to determine the volume of U.S. vegetable oil in </p><p>bulk that might be exported should the ban be lifted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Flour </p><p>----- </p><p>11. Trade Measure: Flour imports are banned. (GON </p><p>Import Prohibition List, 1998) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: In an effort to encourage local </p><p>agricultural processing, the GON has banned flour </p><p>imports for many years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: Nigeria is a large export </p><p>market for U.S. wheat, and removal of the ban on flour </p><p>could be detrimental to this trade. Were the ban to be </p><p>lifted, it is unclear that U.S. flour would be cost- </p><p>competitive with flour milled in other countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Printed Fabric </p><p>-------------- </p><p>12. Trade Measure: Certain printed fabrics known </p><p>locally as African prints may not be imported. (2003 </p><p>Fiscal Policy Measures and Tariff Amendments, February </p><p>25, 2003) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: The ban on African prints was announced in </p><p>an August 27, 2002, Ministry of Finance circular. </p><p>Customs Service Circular No. 25/2002, dated September </p><p>24, 2002, directs customs offices to implement the </p><p>ban. Subsequently, Ministry of Commerce officials--who </p><p>claimed the ban was necessary to meet AGOA trans- </p><p>shipment requirements--reported it had been lifted and </p><p>replaced by a complicated import licensing system. The </p><p>Standards Organization of Nigeria and the Customs </p><p>Service, the would-be implementers of the system, </p><p>could provide no details on how it would work. The </p><p>2003 tariff schedule states that the printed fabric </p><p>import ban will remain in effect for 2003. It does not </p><p>differentiate between African prints and other types </p><p>of printed fabrics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: Post is unaware of any U.S. </p><p>exports of African prints prior to the ban. U.S. trade </p><p>data indicates the Unites States exported $400,000 in </p><p>woven cotton fabrics to Nigeria in 2002. Although </p><p>these U.S. goods are not targeted by the ban, it is </p><p>possible that confusion surrounding the extent of the </p><p>ban could result in cancelled orders, impounded </p><p>shipments, or other difficulties that might reduce </p><p>U.S. exports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Used Clothing </p><p>------------- </p><p>13. Trade Measure: Used clothing imports are banned. </p><p>(Unknown source) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: Customs Service officials say a ban on </p><p>imports of used clothing has been in effect since the </p><p>1970\'s. However, the ban has been poorly enforced, and </p><p>these goods continue to pour over the Benin border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: The impact on U.S. exports </p><p>appears to be minimal due to widespread lack of </p><p>enforcement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rice </p><p>---- </p><p>14. Trade Measure: The GON applies a 100 percent </p><p>tariff on rice imports. (2002 Fiscal Policy Measures </p><p>and Tariff Amendments, March 21, 2002) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: Rice is a staple of the Nigerian diet. GON </p><p>officials believe the country has the potential to be </p><p>self-sufficient in rice production. To date, the GON\'s </p><p>policy instrument of choice to encourage rice </p><p>production in Nigeria--high tariffs--has proven </p><p>unsuccessful. It has substantially raised prices for </p><p>the average consumer without significantly increasing </p><p>domestic production. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: U.S. rice exports to Nigeria </p><p>currently approximate 5,500 metric tons/year, which </p><p>excludes the 12,500 metric tons sold to an NGO in 2003 </p><p>for monetization under a USDA food aid program. </p><p>Nigerian rice imports total about 2 million metric </p><p>tons annually. Industry sources say U.S. raw rice </p><p>would be competitive, but Nigeria imports mostly </p><p>finished, parboiled rice. U.S. finished rice sells for </p><p>$30 to $40 a metric ton more than Indian and Thai </p><p>rice, so even if the duty were lower, U.S. exporters </p><p>would be unlikely to increase their market share. </p><p>Industry sources report that the GON is considering </p><p>proposals by investors who would be prepared to mill </p><p>rice in Nigeria if the duty on unfinished rice were </p><p>lowered to 5 percent. Such a scenario could help U.S. </p><p>rice exporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Bottled Water, Biscuits (Cookies), Noodles, Spaghetti, </p><p>and Toothpicks </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>15. Trade Measure: Imports of Bottled Water, Biscuits </p><p>(Cookies), Noodles, and Toothpicks are banned. </p><p>(Customs Service Circulars, March 3, 2003) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: President Obasanjo announced bans on these </p><p>goods at a campaign stop in early March. A supporter </p><p>of the governing party, Dangote Industries, </p><p>manufactures spaghetti. There are numerous water, </p><p>cookie, and toothpick manufacturers in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impact on U.S. Exports: Industry sources say the </p><p>United States exports biscuits to Nigeria, but data to </p><p>support that claim is not readily available. Clearly, </p><p>the ban would affect whatever exports there are. The </p><p>United States did not export bottled water, noodles, </p><p>or toothpicks to Nigeria in 2002. Ironically, the ban </p><p>on biscuits and noodles could bolster U.S. wheat </p><p>exports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p> Please begin to type the body of the report.
