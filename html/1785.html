SUMMARY:  ON JUNE 18 AND 19 IN HOI AN, IN VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL </p><p>REGION, DONORS GATHERED FOR AN INFORMAL CONSULTATIVE GROUP </p><p>MEETING TO TAKE STOCK OF PROGRESS.  IMF AND WORLD BANK GROUP </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES WERE PLEASED THEIR EXECUTIVE BOARDS HAD APPROVED </p><p>MAJOR STRUCTURAL REFORM/POVERTY ALLEVIATION CREDITS FOR VIETNAM. </p><p>IN ADDITION, PAPERS PRESENTED AND DONORS STATEMENTS REFLECTED A </p><p>GENERAL OPTIMISM FOR VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.  MUCH OF THIS </p><p>HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT HAS MOVED TO THE CONGRESS WHERE ALL  HOPED IT WILL SOON </p><p>BE APPROVED.  AS THE U.S. AND OTHER DONORS HAD URGED, THE AGENDA </p><p>CONTAINED MANY ITEMS REVOLVING AROUND VIETNAMESE COMMITMENTS ON </p><p>TRADE, STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE, AND FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ELABORATED ON ITS PLANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION.  KNOWING </p><p>WASHINGTON AGENCIES ARE INTERESTED IN FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>VIETNAM, WE HAVE INCLUDED A NOTE PREPARED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON </p><p>PLANS TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND DIAGNOSTICS IN THIS CRITICAL </p><p>AREA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AMBASSADOR PETERSON, ACCOMPANIED BY REGIONAL USAID DIRECTOR </p><p>CHILES AND EMBASSY HANOI ECONCOUNS DRY, MADE A NUMBER OF </p><p>INTERVENTIONS AT THE MEETING.  AMBASSADOR NOTED U.S. DESIRE FOR </p><p>VIETNAM TO MOVE RAPIDLY ON ITS GROWTH TRAJECTORY.  BUT IN ORDER </p><p>TO DO SO, HE SAID, THE GOVERNMENT MUST CREATE POLICIES WHICH THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01554  01 OF 04  281007Z </p><p>PEOPLE FULLY SUPPORT.  "IMPROVING THE LOT OF THE PEOPLE SHOULD </p><p>ALWAYS BE THE GOAL."   THE AMBASSADOR URGED THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>AGGRESSIVELY TACKLE STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE REFORM TO REDUCE THE </p><p>"DRAG" THIS SECTOR IMPOSES ON THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE.  THESE </p><p>ENTERPRISES, THE AMBASSADOR CONTINUED, MUST STAND ON THEIR OWN IF </p><p>THEY ARE TO BE ALLOWED TO EXIST AT ALL.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE "MANIPULATION" THESE ENTERPRISES CAN </p><p>ENGAGE IN WITH SEVERE IMPACT ON PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ALSO STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF UNIVERSAL AND IMPROVED </p><p>EDUCATION IN VIETNAM.  HE OBTAINED A COMMITMENT FROM THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD SUPPORT A NATIONAL SAFETY </p><p>CONFERENCE LATER IN THE YEAR TO DEAL WITH VIETNAM\'S HORRENDOUS, </p><p>PREVENTABLE INJURY PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED THE FOLLOWING PAPER ON BUDGETARY </p><p>MANAGEMENT WHICH WE BELIEVE USEFUL TO WASHINGTON AGENCIES AS A </p><p>REFERENCE TOOL.  BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>JOINT MINISTRY OF FINANCE, MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT & </p><p>WORLD BANK NOTE ON PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT </p><p>THIS JOINT NOTE SUMMARIZES THE ANALYSES ON PUBLIC FINANCIAL </p><p>MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE </p><p>DONORS AND THE PROCESSES THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO CONTINUE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON THESE ISSUES ON A CONTINUING BASIS.  IN PARTICULAR </p><p>IT HIGHLIGHTS THE AGENDA OF ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE ANALYSES AND THE DIALOGUE, ESPECIALLY </p><p>THE FOUR MAJOR INITIATIVES THAT ARE PLANNED IN TERMS OF WORK AND </p><p>ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND: </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01554  01 OF 04  281007Z </p><p> </p><p>VARIOUS PIECES OF ANALYSES OF VIETNAM\'S PUBLIC FINANCIAL </p><p>MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN </p><p>SINCE SEPTEMBER 1998.  THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY REPORT - TOWARDS </p><p>FISCAL TRANSPARENCY- DONE JOINTLY BY THE WORLD BANK AND THE IMF, </p><p>WAS COMPLETED AND PUBLISHED WIDELY IN EARLY 1999.  IT LAID OUT A </p><p>MEDIUM-TERM AGENDA OF ACTIONS FOR IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY OF </p><p>BUDGETARY INFORMATION AND PROCESSES - INTERNAL (OR MANAGEMENT), </p><p>EXTERNAL (I.E. FOR DONORS AND IFIS) AND PUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECOND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW (PER) - MANAGING PUBLIC </p><p>RESOURCES BETTER- DONE JOINTLY BY THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THE </p><p>DONORS IN A HIGHLY PARTICIPATORY PROCESS, WENT FURTHER TO </p><p>INCREASE AND EXPAND TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION ON PUBLIC </p><p>SPENDING.  THIS PER WAS FIRST DISCUSSED IN DALAT AT THE MID-TERM </p><p>CG IN JUNE 2000 AND SUBSEQUENTLY PRINTED IN TWO VOLUMES IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 2000.  IT IS NOW AVAILABLE WIDELY ON THE WEB SINCE. </p><p> </p><p>THIS PER WAS CARRIED OUT BY GOVERNMENT\'S WORKING GROUP.  SEVERAL </p><p>DONORS - WORLD BANK (MANAGING THE EFFORT), IMF, NETHERLANDS, UK, </p><p>DENMARK AND SWEDEN AS WELL AS ACTION AID, WORKED DIRECTLY WITH </p><p>THAT WORKING GROUP AND CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE REPORT. </p><p>ALL DONORS WERE INVOLVED IN A SERIES OF FIVE CONSULTATIONS ON </p><p>VARIOUS DRAFTS OF THE PER DURING THE PROCESS OF ITS PREPARATION. </p><p>THE PUBLISHED PER REPORT WAS DISSEMINATED TO THE PROVINCES BY THE </p><p>MOF THROUGH NUMEROUS WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS DURING THE FIRST </p><p>THREE MONTHS OF 2001. </p><p>IN FEBRUARY 2001, THE GOVERNMENT LED A PERMANENT GOVERNMENT-DONOR- </p><p>NGO WORKING GROUP ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REFORM (ARISING OUT OF A </p><p>MERGER OF THE SEPARATE WORKING GROUPS OF GOVERNMENT AND OF THE </p><p>DONORS CREATED FOR DOING THE PER) AND THE WORLD BANK AGREED TO </p><p>PROVIDE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THAT GROUP.  THE FIRST MEETING IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 28 WAS CHAIRED JOINTLY BY MADAM LE THI BANG TAM, VICE </p><p>MINISTER OF FINANCE, AND MR. ANDREW STEER, COUNTRY DIRECTOR OF </p><p>WORLD BANK IN VIETNAM. THE SECOND MEETING ON JUNE 5 WAS CHAIRED </p><p>BY MR. NGUYEN BA TOAN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR EXTERNAL RELATIONS, MOF, </p><p>AND KAZI M. MATIN, CHIEF ECONOMIST OF THE WORLD BANK IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DEVELOPED A DETAILED MATRIX OF ACTIONS </p><p>BASED ON THE PER CITING THE STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN EACH YEAR (I.E. </p><p>2001-2003) AND THE LIKELY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS FOR </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THEM AND PRESENTED IT FOR DISCUSSION IN THE FIRST </p><p>MEETING OF THE WORKING GROUP ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ISSUES. </p><p>DONORS INDICATED THEIR INTEREST FOR TA TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THIS </p><p>WAS INCORPORATED IN THE SECOND VERSION OF DETAILED MATRIX OF </p><p>ACTIONS (SHOWN IN ANNEX 1 OF THIS NOTE). </p><p> </p><p>DONORS AGREED THAT THIS MATRIX DEVELOPED BY THE GOVERNMENT WOULD </p><p>BE USED FOR FUTURE DONOR SUPPORTS TO PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01554  02 OF 04  281007Z </p><p>IN VIETNAM.  IF NEW ISSUES ARISE AND THE GOVERNMENT AGREES TO NEW </p><p>ACTIONS AS A RESULT, THEY WILL BE ADDED TO THE AGENDA, USING THIS </p><p>MATRIX FRAMEWORK. </p><p>MORE RECENTLY, A COUNTRY FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY ASSESSMENT </p><p>(I.E. CFAA) HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT JOINTLY BY ADB AND THE WORLD </p><p>BANK IN THE LATER PART OF 2000 AND 2001.  THIS ASSESSMENT COVERS </p><p>FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES IN BOTH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE </p><p>PUBLIC SECTOR.  ADB FOCUSED MAINLY ON PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>ACCOUNTING/FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES AND THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN </p><p>PUBLISHED AS VOLUME 1 OF THE REPORT.  THE WORLD BANK FOCUSED ON </p><p>PUBLIC FINANCIAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AS WELL AS ON </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE WORLD BANK\'S DRAFT </p><p>CFAA IS CURRENTLY UNDER DISCUSSION WITH THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. </p><p>THERE WERE A FEW NEW ISSUES AND SUGGESTED ACTIONS THAT HAVE </p><p>EMERGED FROM THIS CFAA WORK ON PUBLIC FINANCIAL CONTROL AND </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY; THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WILL REVIEW THESE ISSUES </p><p>AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONSIDER ADDING THEM TO THE MATRIX IN THE </p><p>APPROPRIATE SECTION. </p><p> </p><p>RECENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT: </p><p> </p><p>-- DESIGNATED THE STATE TREASURY AS THE MAIN AGENCY RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR MAINTAINING THE CONSOLIDATED PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND THUS FOR </p><p>ESTABLISHING THE INTEGRATED PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT </p><p>INFORMATION SYSTEM. </p><p>-- INITIATED STUDY AND SURVEY ON THE UNIFICATION OF THE TREASURY, </p><p>BUDGET AND TAXATION ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS. </p><p>-- ISSUED REGULATION ON FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEM OF </p><p>ENTERPRISES, INCLUDING SOES TO MAKE INFORMATION ON PERFORMANCE OF </p><p>SOES SYSTEMATIC AND ACCESSIBLE (DECISION 167/2000/QD-BTC OF </p><p>OCTOBER 25, 2000). </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01554  02 OF 04  281007Z </p><p>-- DEVELOPED COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION/DATA ON THE "OFF-BUDGET" </p><p>FUNDS SUCH AS DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT FUND, SOCIAL SECURITIES FUND, </p><p>NATIONAL FUND FOR EMPLOYMENT, ETC. </p><p>-- COMPLETED THE DRAFT AMENDMENT OF THE REGULATIONS FOR STATE </p><p>BUDGET TRANSPARENCY AT ALL LEVELS (I.E.
