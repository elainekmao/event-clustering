EconOff spoke with Chief Owodu, Technical Assistant to </p><p>the Minister of Aviation, on April 25 regarding the election </p><p>of ICAO Council President as requested Refs B and C.  Chief </p><p>Owodu said that Nigeria would support the incumbent, Dr. </p><p>Assad Kotaite, as he has done a "superlative job" leading the </p><p>ICAO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The Embassy received on April 18 a Note Verbale from MFA </p><p>to all accredited High Commissions, Embassies and </p><p>International Organizations in Nigeria that are members of </p><p>the ICAO requesting support for Nigerian re-election into the </p><p>Council of ICAO.

Begin text of Note: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Note No F705/2001 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(complimentary opening) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>...the Federal Government of Nigeria has decided to present </p><p>its candidacy for re-election into the Council of ICAO during </p><p>the General Assembly Session of the organization scheduled to </p><p>be held from 25 September - 5 October, 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Federal Government of Nigeria solicits the support of the </p><p>Governments of the Accredited Representatives for the </p><p>Nigerian candidacy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(complimentary closing) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End text of Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT: According to Ministry of Aviation officials, </p><p>Nigeria\'s position vis--vis ICAO is handled regionally at </p><p>the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC) in Dakar. </p><p>AFCAC\'s position on these two issues, according to Ministry </p><p>officials, is closer to the European position (Ref A).  In </p><p>examining Nigeria\'s candidacy to the ICAO Council, Department </p><p>may want to consider GON willingness to support positions </p><p>contrary to USG interests on emissions levels and noise </p><p>standards.  On the other hand, Nigeria\'s bid for reelection </p><p>could provide an opportunity to seek GON support for issues </p><p>pending decision within the ICAO.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACTION REQUEST: Post will inform Nigerian MFA that its </p><p>request has been forwarded to appropriate USG authorities. </p><p>Please advise if Department takes a position on Nigeria\'s </p><p>candidacy. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
