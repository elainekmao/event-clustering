<p>UNCLAS ROME 000019 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, AORC, PREF, EU, WFP, UN, AFGHANISTAN </p><p>SUBJECT:  WFP PLANS TO ASSIST THE AFGHAN PRIMARY SCHOOL AND </p><p>NON-FORMAL EDUCATION SECTOR - THE NEXT EMERGENCY OPERATION </p><p>(EMOP) APPEAL APRIL-DECEMBER 2002 </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ROME 6582 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. AS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF ITS NEXT EMERGENCY (EMOP) </p><p>OPERATION APPEAL (FROM APRIL THROUGH DECEMBER 2002), WFP IS </p><p>PLANNING FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR 270,000 PRIMARY SCHOOL </p><p>STUDENTS, FOOD AID FOR TRAINING 50,000 TEACHERS, ASSISTANCE </p><p>TO 75,000 ENROLLED IN NON-FORMAL EDUCATION ACTIVITIES, AND </p><p>FOOD-FOR-WORK FOR 80,000 ENGAGED IN EDUCATION-RELATED ASSET </p><p>CREATION IN AFGHANISTAN. IN THE MEDIUM-LONG TERM, FOOD FOR </p><p>EDUCATION IS INCREASINGLY ENVISIONED AS WFP\'S "NICHE" IN </p><p>ASSISTING AFGHANISTAN\'S DEVELOPMENT. END SUMMARY. </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. USMISSION HUMANITARIAN ATTACHE AND SENIOR EMERGENCY </p><p>COORDINATOR SPOKE ON DECEMBER 28 WITH ARLENE MITCHELL, WFP\'S </p><p>COORDINATOR FOR THE GLOBAL FOOD FOR EDUCATION INITIATIVE. </p><p>SHE RELATED DETAILS OF HER MID-DECEMBER TRIP TO PAKISTAN TO </p><p>REVIEW CURRENT AND POTENTIAL WFP INVOLVEMENT IN THE AFGHAN </p><p>EDUCATION SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>3. MITCHELL REFERRED REPEATEDLY TO A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION </p><p>SECTOR ASSESSMENT "EFA 2000 AFGHANISTAN" CONDUCTED BY </p><p>UNESCO, IN COOPERATION WITH UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR, SAVE THE </p><p>CHILDREN (USA) AND THE SWEDISH COMMITTEE FOR AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>WHICH PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING "DIRE" END OF DECADE EDUCATION </p><p>SCENARIO FOR AFGHNISTAN: </p><p> </p><p>A. THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS HAS HALVED IN THE PAST TWENTY </p><p>YEARS. IN 1990, ALL PROVINCES HAD SCHOOLS; IN 1995, NINE OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN\'S TWENTY-NINE PROVINCES HAD NONE. EVEN THOUGH </p><p>PRIMARY EDUCATION WAS OFFICIALLY MADE COMPULSORY IN 1964, </p><p>"SERIOUS IMPLEMENTATION HAS NOT OCCURRED." </p><p> </p><p>B. GIRL\'S EDUCATION HAS BEEN SEVERELY COMPROMISED. IN 1978, </p><p>AT THE TIME OF THE SOVIET INVASION, THE GROSS ENROLLMENT </p><p>RATE (GER) WAS CALCULATED AT 8 PERCENT FOR GIRLS AND 37 </p><p>PERCENT FOR BOYS. IN 2000, THE GER STOOD AT 3 PERCENT FOR </p><p>GIRLS AND 39 PERCENT FOR BOYS. AT PRESENT, GIRL\'S SCHOOLS </p><p>REPRESENT ONLY 14.9 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SCHOOLS </p><p>IN THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>C. ESTIMATED DATA AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL (UNICEF, 1998) LIST </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 4.4 MILLION CHILDREN OF PRIMARY SCHOOL AGE. OF </p><p>THIS, SOME 3.4 MILLION, 2 MILLION GIRLS AND 1.4 MILLION </p><p>BOYS, DO NOT ATTEND SCHOOL. </p><p> </p><p>D. IN 1978, THE AFGHAN TEACHING CADRE WAS ESTIMATED AT </p><p>30,502. IN 2000, THE NUMBER DROPPED TO 27,230, OF WHOM 10 </p><p>PERCENT ARE WOMEN. THE PERCENTAGE OF PRIMARY TEACHERS WITH </p><p>REQUIRED ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 18.3 </p><p>PERCENT. PRE-SERVICE TEACHER TRAINING HAS BEEN SEVERELY </p><p>REDUCED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS, AND ADJUDGED ALMOST "NON- </p><p>EXISTENT" IN 2000. </p><p> </p><p>F.  THE PRIMARY SCHOOL STUDENT "SURVIVAL RATE" TO GRADE FIVE </p><p>IS 48.8 PERCENT. </p><p></p><p>G. 69.5 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ILLITERATE, WITH THE </p><p>PERCENTAGE OF ILLITERACY FOR WOMEN ESTIMATED AT 85 PERCENT. </p><p>THIS CONTRASTS WITH SOUTH ASIA AS A WHOLE WHERE TWO-THIRDS </p><p>OF THE WOMEN ARE ILLITERATE, COMPARED WITH ABOUT ONE-THIRD </p><p>OF THE MEN. </p><p> </p><p>H. PRE-SCHOOLS: AFGHANISTAN HAD AN EARLY CHILDHOOD </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AS FAR BACK AS 1980. 195 DAY-CARE </p><p>CENTERS WERE IN EXISTENCE IN 1990. IN 1999, THIS NUMBER HAD </p><p>DROPPED TO ONE. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>WFP\'S PLANNED SUPPORT TO THE AFGHAN EDUCATION SECTOR FOR </p><p>2002 AND BEYOND - WFP\'S NEXT EMOP APPEAL (APRIL -DECEMBER </p><p>2002) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. MITCHELL COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT SITUATION </p><p>CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE EFFORT TO GET CHILDREN AND ADULTS </p><p>EDUCATED (ADULTS THROUGH THE NON-FORMAL EDUCATION VENUE), </p><p>THE SITUATION WITH THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER </p><p>PARTNERS COMBINED WITH THE ON-THE-GROUND DIFFICULTIES OF </p><p>WORKING IN AFGHANISTAN - CONSTITUTE FORMIDABLE IMPEDIMENTS </p><p>TO ANY MAJOR EFFORT. WFP THEREFORE PROPOSES TO BUILD ON ITS </p><p>PAST EXPERIENCE (IN SELECTED DISTRICTS OF BADAKSHAN </p><p>PROVINCE) IN A PHASED MANNER NATIONALLY FOR THE PERIOD APRIL </p><p>2002-DECEMBER 2002, AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>A. FOOD FOR EDUCATION FOR 270,000 STUDENTS, TEACHERS AND </p><p>SCHOOL SERVICE WORKERS TO ENCOURAGE ENROLMENT, GOOD </p><p>ATTENDANCE, LOWER THE DROP OUT RATE, AND ENHANCE IN-SCHOOL </p><p>PERFORMANCE. WHERE NECESSARY, TAKE HOME RATIONS MAY BE </p><p>PROVIDED AS AN ECONOMIC INCENTIVE FOR FAMILIES TO SEND </p><p>CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. AT THE OUTSET, WFP PLANS TO RESPOND </p><p>FLEXIBLY AT URBAN AND RURAL LOCATIONS AND AT BOTH THE </p><p>SECONDARY AND PRIMARY LEVELS. (WITHIN TWO-THREE YEARS, THE </p><p>EMPHASIS WILL BE INCREASINGLY ON PRIMARY AND RURAL SCHOOLS.) </p><p> </p><p>B. TEACHER TRAINING - WFP WILL PROVIDE FOOD TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>TRAINING AND RETRAINING OF UP TO 50,000 FORMER TEACHERS, </p><p>TEACHER CANDIDATES, AND CURRENT TEACHERS. MITCHELL SPOKE OF </p><p>POSSIBLE UN PROMOTION OF A "TEACHER TRAINING CORPS," DRAWING </p><p>ON A CADRE OF TEACHER VOLUNTEERS FROM THE CENTRAL ASIA </p><p>REGION OR BEYOND. </p><p> </p><p>C. NON-FORMAL EDUCATION - FOOD AID WILL BE PROVIDED TO UP TO </p><p>75,000 YOUTHS AND ADULTS WHO REQUIRE LITERACY AND SKILLS </p><p>TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>D. FOOD-FOR-WORK/FOOD ASSET CREATION - FOOD AID WILL BE </p><p>PROVIDED FOR UP TO 80,000 BENEFICIARIES/MONTH. WFP WILL WORK </p><p>WITH COMMUNITIES TO BUILD OR REBUILD SCHOOLS AND RELATED </p><p>SANITARY FACILITIES, AND TO ESTABLISH INCOME-GENERATING </p><p>ACTIVITIES RELATED TO EDUCATION. IN PARTICULAR, WFP PLANS TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY-BASED BREAD BAKERIES TO SUPPLY SCHOOLS </p><p>DAILY WITH FORTIFIED BREAD. THIS WOULD GENERATE JOBS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN, BY PROVIDING A READY "MARKET". </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p></p><p>5. GIVEN ITS MASSIVE FOOD AID FLOWS IN RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>PRESENT CRISIS, WFP IS NATIONALLY THE MOST OPERATIONAL UN </p><p>AGENCY IN AFGHANISTAN. WFP HAS PREVIOUS (AND FAVORABLE) </p><p>EXPERIENCE IN SCHOOL FEEDING IN BOTH NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>AND PAKISTAN AND A HEAVY INVOLVEMENT IN THE U.S.-LED GLOBAL </p><p>FOOD FOR EDUCATION INITIATIVE (REF A).  WFP FEELS THAT ITS </p><p>MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM "NICHE" IN AFGHANISTAN OVER THE NEXT </p><p>ONE-TWO DECADES WILL BE TIGHTLY LINKED TO FOOD FOR </p><p>EDUCATION. CLEARLY THE NEED IS THERE. WHAT IS NOW REQUIRED </p><p>IS THE DELICATE TASK OF: (A) OBTAINING THE AGREEMENT OF THE </p><p>AFGHAN GOVERNMENT THAT WFP\'S APPROACH WILL SUPPORT THEIR </p><p>PRIORITIES AND NEEDS; AND (B) "CONCRETIZING" THE COOPERATION </p><p>OF WFP\'S IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS. THE RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM </p><p>(I.E., NINE-MONTH) FOCUS OF THE PROPOSED EMOP SHOULD GIVE </p><p>WFP A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO "FURTER TEST THE EDUCATIONAL </p><p>WATERS." </p><p> </p><p>6. DUSHANBE MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. HEILEMAN </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
