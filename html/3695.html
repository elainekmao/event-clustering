(U) UNICEF has confirmed that the Liberation Tigers </p><p>of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have recently released up to 85 </p><p>child recruits.  According to UNICEF officials (see </p><p>Ref), the LTTE apparently released the children </p><p>gradually, over the course of several weeks in the late </p><p>August through early September timeframe.  After receipt </p><p>of a list of the childrens\' names from the LTTE, UNICEF </p><p>has interviewed more than 20 of them, confirming that </p><p>they had indeed been forcibly recruited into the LTTE\'s </p><p>military structure and then returned to their families </p><p>of late.  UNICEF is confident that the rest of the names </p><p>on the LTTE\'s list are also legitimate former child </p><p>recruits.  UNICEF is working with the families on </p><p>programs focused on reintegrating the children back into </p><p>society. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) UNICEF has monitored the LTTE\'s release of </p><p>smaller numbers of child recruits in past years, but the </p><p>apparent release of the 85 is unprecedented in its size. </p><p>UNICEF contacts tell us that they continue to closely </p><p>work with the LTTE to ensure the release of other child </p><p>recruits.  While UNICEF does not have an approximate </p><p>figure, other contacts estimate that the LTTE may have </p><p>well over 100 child soldiers still in its ranks, </p><p>although the precise figure is not clear.  (Note:  There </p><p>are occasional reports that the LTTE continues to </p><p>recruit children forcibly, particularly in the eastern </p><p>region.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Tigers apparently took the step of releasing </p><p>the child recruits in reaction to the pressure it has </p><p>received on this issue from domestic and international </p><p>sources.  In a meeting with polchief, Harim Peiris, a </p><p>spokesman for President Kumaratunga, noted that the </p><p>President has been publicly pushing for the LTTE to </p><p>improve its dire record in this area for years.  Earlier </p><p>this year, a visiting high-level Amnesty International </p><p>team also urged the Tigers to take immediate steps on </p><p>the issue in meetings with the group in the LTTE- </p><p>controlled Wanni region of northern Sri Lanka.  M. </p><p>Nizar, an analyst at UNICEF, noted to us that it was </p><p>clear that the LTTE was taking the child soldier issue </p><p>very seriously based on the fact that LTTE Political </p><p>Chief Thamilchelvan began to take a personal interest in </p><p>the issue over the summer.  Thamilchelvan, in fact, had </p><p>noted to UNICEF representatives that the LTTE aimed to </p><p>abide by the provisions of the Convention of the Rights </p><p>of the Child. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  The move re the child recruits may </p><p>indicate a newfound receptivity by the Tigers to the </p><p>notion of improving their abysmal human rights record. </p><p>In the past, the group basically ignored the substantial </p><p>criticism it received on human rights issues.  Perhaps </p><p>with the peace process in full swing, the LTTE wants to </p><p>clean up its act in order to look more respectable.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
