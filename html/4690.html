Erdogan drew attention to Turkey\'s </p><p>economic losses after the Gulf War, and stressed that a new </p><p>operation\'s impact on Turkey would be severe.  Erdogan said </p><p>that in his meetings with US officials, he was offered the </p><p>`comical\' sum of $1-2 billion for Turkey\'s potential losses </p><p>in a military operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU Summit: All papers give extensive coverage to the EU </p><p>summit that begins today in Copenhagen.  "Hurriyet" reports </p><p>that the summit will formally begin this evening with a </p><p>dinner of EU leaders, and questions whether it will be a </p><p>`christians only\' supper like `the last Supper\' of Jesus, or </p><p>whether there will be a muslim at the table!  Turkey and the </p><p>EU will drift apart if Turkey is not given a date for </p><p>accession talks in the near future.  "Turkiye" claims that </p><p>the summit will be a test for EU sincerity and goodwill. </p><p>All papers agree that Turkey\'s goal will be to start the </p><p>accession talks in 2003, and note that the German and French </p><p>formula for 2005 is not acceptable.  Meanwhile, papers </p><p>report that the US has intensified its efforts in support of </p><p>Turkey.  President Bush has called several EU leaders, </p><p>including Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen and French </p><p>President Chirac, following his meeting with Erdogan. </p><p>"Radikal" columnist Murat Yetkin cites Secretary Powell\'s </p><p>interview with  French TV-2, in which Powell urges that an </p><p>accession date be given to Turkey at the Copenhagen summit\'. </p><p>Cyprus: "Sabah" reports that the outcome of the EU summit </p><p>depends on TRNC president Denktas.  Denktas\' refusal of </p><p>discussions will benefit the Greek Cypriots.  Despite many </p><p>objections by some Greek Cypriots, Clerides has already gone </p><p>to Copenhagen to sign the UN agreement.  Due to medical </p><p>problems, however, Denktas will be coming to Ankara for </p><p>treatment.  Erdogan reportedly convinced Denktas to send his </p><p>Foreign Minister to Copenhagen, but Denktas insists that the </p><p>Minister will attend the summit as an `observer\' with no </p><p>authority to sign the UN plan.  "Vatan" reports that the </p><p>TRNC will negotiate the Annan plan if Turkey is given a date </p><p>for EU accession. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Constitutional Reforms: All papers report that the first </p><p>harmonization package, which removes some restrictions in </p><p>the political party and election laws and extends freedoms, </p><p>was approved yesterday in parliament.  However, the second </p><p>harmonization package, which included articles on re-trial </p><p>and disciplinary pardons, was postponed to a date after the </p><p>Copenhagen summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Washington Visit" </p><p>Cengiz Candar, one of the travelling press with Erdogan, </p><p>wrote in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak (12/12): "The </p><p>agenda for the Bush-Erdogan meeting was predominantly Iraq. </p><p>Bush clearly asked Erdogan for Turkey\'s acceptance of US </p><p>demands presented earlier by Wolfowitz.  The nature of some </p><p>of these demands is preventing Turkey from giving a quick </p><p>response, particularly the stationing of around 100,000 US </p><p>troops in Turkey. . It seems that Erdogan did not make any </p><p>binding commitments for Turkey during his discussion with </p><p>President Bush.  This is because Erdogan himself finds it </p><p>difficult to characterize Turkey\'s possible role and stance. </p><p>He also finds difficult to say `no\' to the US.  He </p><p>appreciates the importance of Turkish-US relations, and </p><p>values the treatment given him at the White House. . Erdogan </p><p>cannot pronounce a clear-cut `no\' to the US demands, even in </p><p>a lowered voice.  Yet he feels it very hard to explain and </p><p>justify possible Turkish-American collaboration against Iraq </p><p>to the Turkish public.  Therefore, the current picture </p><p>presents a deadlock in Erdogan\'s view. In fact, he hopes to </p><p>overcome it by taking his time to respond to the US." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"US shows the stick, and gives no carrot" </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli wrote from Washington in tabloid Star </p><p>(12/12): "Following the meetings in Washington, Erdogan and </p><p>his party believe that a war in Iraq is inevitable, and is </p><p>just a matter of time. . The US message to Erdogan and his </p><p>party was clear enough: `Iraq\'s weapons of mass destruction </p><p>pose a serious threat, and are more of a threat to Turkey </p><p>than to the US.  Thus, we expect Turkey to support us.\'  . </p><p>The threat factor, or the `stick\' if you will, worked fine. </p><p>Erdogan seemed convinced about the seriousness of Iraqi </p><p>threat.  However, he was also expecting to see a `carrot\' </p><p>along with the stick.  . Erdogan described the huge losses </p><p>that Turkey suffered during the Gulf War, mentioning the </p><p>figure of 100 billion dollars.  However, the figure given in </p><p>return by American officials to compensate Turkey\'s losses </p><p>in the case of a new war was simply annoying.  Erdogan </p><p>confirmed his disappointment later, saying that `comical </p><p>amounts\' such as 1 or 2 billion dollars had been discussed. </p><p>. Because of this approach, Erdogan is now trying to </p><p>establish some new obstacles vis--vis a military operation </p><p>against Iraq.  Now he talks about the need for `convincing </p><p>the public,\' and calls for an Arab coalition to include </p><p>Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia being drawn into the game." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH, ACTING </p><p></p></div>
