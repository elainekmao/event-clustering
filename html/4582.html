<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008783 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, TU, POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: OPPOSITION CHP SEES AN AK PARTY DIVIDED </p><p>AGAINST ITSELF AND SEEKS TO EXPLOIT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter; </p><p>reasons: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Trounced at the polls on Nov. 3, Deniz </p><p>Baykal\'s CHP is already trying to turn the tables on the </p><p>Islam-influenced AK Party government.  CHP is now focusing on </p><p>the headscarf controversy that flared up again when AK\'s </p><p>Speaker of Parliament Arinc and his headscarf-clad wife were </p><p>on hand together to see off President Sezer on a foreign </p><p>visit late last month.  We expect CHP to continue to hammer </p><p>at this point in the aftermath of the Nov. 29 National </p><p>Security Council meeting, during which AK was lectured by the </p><p>military about the virtues of Kemalist secularism (septel). </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Much of the AK (Justice and Development) Party\'s </p><p>success in the Nov. 3 national election rested on its ability </p><p>to woo both religious voters and those on the center-right </p><p>disaffected by mainstream party fecklessness.  According to </p><p>contacts on the political left-of-center, AK also benefited </p><p>from the perception that its main rival, the CHP (Republican </p><p>People\'s Party), is an elitist organization out of touch with </p><p>ordinary Turks; CHP leader Baykal\'s unpopular personality, </p><p>they say, also encouraged some center-left voters to stay </p><p>home on election day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Aware of their party\'s shortcomings, senior CHP </p><p>officials are trying to shift the focus to AK and its own </p><p>foibles.  They tell us that a split between AK\'s "religious" </p><p>and "mainstream" wings is already growing and will </p><p>ultimately, they hope, lead to AK\'s demise -- either via a </p><p>confrontation with the Deep State or in a decisive defeat at </p><p>the ballot box. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- CHP Deputy Group Chairman (party whip) Mustafa Ozyurek </p><p>pointedly told us Nov. 22 that CHP is "extremely </p><p>uncomfortable" with Arinc\'s supposed headscarf posturing, </p><p>predicting that this is only the beginning of anti-Kemalist </p><p>things to come.  Ozyurek claimed that the headscarf is the </p><p>Islamist camel\'s nose under the Kemalist tent.  Religious </p><p>Turks, he asserted, "now want equality" with the secularists </p><p>whom Ozyurek represents -- tacitly implying that they have </p><p>not yet achieved that status -- "but will soon seek </p><p>superiority."  (Note: aware of the risk of being boxed in so </p><p>early in AK\'s tenure, AK leader Erdogan subsequently issued a </p><p>clear warning to party members to avoid bringing up the </p><p>headscarf issue in public.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Haluk Koc, another CHP Deputy Group Chairman, reiterated </p><p>to Poloff Nov. 29 CHP\'s concern about the headscarf.  He </p><p>averred that an AK split is inevitable, but is likely to </p><p>emerge only slowly over the next year.  Koc explained that </p><p>AK\'s "religious base" will demand more progress on </p><p>politically sensitive issues such as the headscarf, which CHP </p><p>and the Establishment see as a redline.  He predicted that </p><p>"moderates" within AK will not support challenging the State </p><p>on the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While some of the CHP officials\' comments reflect </p><p>wishful thinking, they also capture what may be AK\'s Achilles </p><p>heel.  From what CHP is telling us, it is clear that the </p><p>party hopes to exploit the headscarf controversy to burnish </p><p>its own credentials as parliamentary champion of the Kemalist </p><p>establishment; paint AK as confrontational and as a mere </p><p>continuation of Refah-Fazilet Islamism; and drive a wedge </p><p>between what it sees as competing factions within AK. </p><p>Indeed, one local AK official -- a former administrator in a </p><p>center-right party -- told us prior to the elections that if </p><p>AK pushes too hard on religious issues, people like himself </p><p>will leave the party in droves.  AK leaders except Arinc have </p><p>been trying to avoid the headscarf issue, recognizing the </p><p>danger of being decisively labeled "reactionary" as they try </p><p>to consolidate their Government\'s position early in its </p><p>tenure.  Nevertheless, we can expect CHP to continue trying </p><p>to hammer away at this chink in the AK armor. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
