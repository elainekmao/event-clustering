SEE PARA 4. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY OF AGREEMENT:  VERBAL AGREEMENT HAS BEEN </p><p>REACHED AMONG USAID, WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ON AN ARRANGEMENT THAT WILL ALLOW ENTRY OF </p><p>17,500 MTS OF USG YELLOW WHOLE MAIZE GRAIN CURRENTLY STORED </p><p>IN DURBAN, THAT MAY CONTAIN GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS </p><p>(GMO), TO ENTER ZIMBABWE FOR THE BENEFIT OF WFP </p><p>BENEFICIARIES SUFFERING FROM THE CURRENT FOOD SECURITY </p><p>CRISIS.  THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR A ONE-TO-ONE SWAP OF US- </p><p>DONATED (GMO) WHOLE KERNEL MAIZE WITH GOZ-IMPORTED (NON-GMO) </p><p>WHOLE KERNEL MAIZE THAT IS ALREADY IN COUNTRY.  THE FORMER </p><p>WOULD BE MILLED BY GOZ AND MARKETED BY THEIR GRAIN MARKETING </p><p>BOARD (GMB), AND THE LATTER WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED AS GRAIN BY </p><p>WFP TO ITS BENEFICIARIES IN USAID-MARKED BAGS.  THIS </p><p>ARRANGEMENT RESOLVES THE IMPASSE CREATED BY GOZ CONCERNS </p><p>THAT GMO GRAIN COULD POTENTIALLY "CONTAMINATE" LOCAL MAIZE </p><p>SEED VARIETIES.  THE AGREEMENT ALSO AVOIDS THE NEED FOR </p><p>EITHER PARTY TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA MILLING COSTS THAT </p><p>OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) DETAILS OF SWAP:  AGREEMENT CALLS FOR A ONE-TO-ONE </p><p>SWAP OF GOZ-IMPORTED WHOLE MAIZE GRAIN FOR USAID-DONATED </p><p>YELLOW WHOLE MAIZE GRAIN.  THE USAID MAIZE CURRENTLY STORED </p><p>IN DURBAN WOULD BE BAGGED IN DURBAN PORT USING GOZ-PROVIDED </p><p>BAGS, AND DELIVERED TO GMB DEPOT IN GWERU.  GMB WOULD </p><p>IMMEDIATELY MILL IT UPON RECEIPT AND DISTRIBUTE THROUGH ITS </p><p>NORMAL MARKETING CHANNELS.  THE GOZ-IMPORTED MAIZE WOULD BE </p><p>BAGGED (AT GOZ COST) IN USAID-MARKED BAGS (BROUGHT IN FROM </p><p>DURBAN BY THE WFP), AND COLLECTED BY WFP FROM GMB DEPOTS IN </p><p>THE HARARE AREA FOR DISTRIBUTION TO ITS BENEFICIARIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING:  A MEMORANDUM OF </p><p>UNDERSTANDING (MOU) AMONG USAID, WFP AND GOZ HAS BEEN </p><p>DRAFTED (BY WFP AND USAID) AND SENT TO FFP/W FOR WASHINGTON </p><p>REVIEW.  THIS MOU PROVIDES MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THE LOGISTICAL </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE SWAP AND BAGGING ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL </p><p>AS DETAILED COMMODITY QUALITY STANDARDS THAT MUST BE MET BY </p><p>BOTH PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) RECOMMENDATION FOR ACTION:  POST ENDORSES THIS </p><p>AGREEMENT AS A WIN-WIN RESOLUTION THAT WILL HELP USAID AND </p><p>WFP TO MEET THE URGENT FOOD NEEDS OF MILLIONS OF POOR RURAL </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN HOUSEHOLDS, WHILE ALLAYING GOZ CONCERNS REGARDING </p><p>POTENTIAL GMO CONTAMINATION OF LOCAL MAIZE VARIETIES.  POST </p><p>REQUESTS WASHINGTON TO PROVIDE ITS CONCURRENCE FOR THIS </p><p>PROPOSED SWAP URGENTLY.  ONCE CONCURRENCE RECEIVED, POST </p><p>WILL REQUEST WFP TO IMMEDIATELY INITIATE PLANS TO SEND A </p><p>LIMITED QUANTITY (NO MORE THAN 800 MTS) TO ZIMBABWE AS AN </p><p>INITIAL TRANCHE. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
