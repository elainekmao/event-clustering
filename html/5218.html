(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador met with MFA Minstate Hamdan Bin Zayid </p><p>Al-Nahyan 1/19 to seek an explanation for the decision </p><p>(reported in the UAE press) by the UAEG to allow Iraq to </p><p>upgrade its diplomatic ties here to the level of Ambassador. </p><p>(Note:  In August 2000, the UAE agreed to the reopening of </p><p>the Iraqi embassy here and the Emirati embassy in Baghdad. </p><p>At the time, the decision was to maintain the representation </p><p>at the Charge level.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hamdan, who seemed surprised by the Ambassador\'s </p><p>query, confirmed that the decision had indeed been taken to </p><p>accept a new ambassador.  He had met with and accepted a </p><p>copy of the credentials of Baghdad\'s new envoy, Ali Sabti </p><p>Muhammad Al-Hadithi, the previous day.  (Note:  According to </p><p>Hamdan\'s Protocol Chief, while Iraq is upgrading its status </p><p>here, the UAE plans to maintain its diplomatic </p><p>representation in Baghdad at the Charge level.  End Note.) </p><p>The Ambassador questioned the motive and, especially, the </p><p>timing of the decision.  Hamdan responded that the decision </p><p>had been taken six months ago, was not at all related to the </p><p>current crisis, and that Al-Hadithi, who had previously </p><p>served as the Iraqi Ambassador in Bahrain, had been well </p><p>recommended by the Bahrainis. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Unhappy with the current Iraqi Charge, Hamdan felt </p><p>Al-Hadithi was someone "we can work with."  Hamdan appeared </p><p>pleased with his first meeting with the new Iraqi diplomat, </p><p>noting "he is not a pure Ba\'athist."  In a refreshing </p><p>departure from other Iraqi officials, Al-Hadithi reportedly </p><p>spoke quite openly about the future and, in Hamdan\'s view, </p><p>appeared to be someone "we could work with in the post- </p><p>Saddam era."  The Bahrainis had briefed the Emiratis that </p><p>Al-Hadithi had concerned himself with primarily economic </p><p>issues during his tenure in Manama.  In other words, Hamdan </p><p>noted, the new Iraqi envoy does not act like "a mukhabarat </p><p>(intelligence) type." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: When rumors of an upgrade in political ties </p><p>between the UAE and Iraq surfaced last summer, the </p><p>Ambassador confronted Hamdan and advised him against such a </p><p>move.  At that time, i.e. six months ago, Hamdan admitted to </p><p>the Ambassador that Baghdad had been pushing for an </p><p>improvement, but that the Abu Dhabi leadership had decided </p><p>against it.  This decision was apparently reversed in what </p><p>can only be characterized as a real lapse in judgment, </p><p>unless the UAEG has decided to accept Al-Hadithi as someone </p><p>they can work with  during a transition after military </p><p>action against Iraq.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
