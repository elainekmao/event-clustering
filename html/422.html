<p>UNCLAS ACCRA 07474 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/CT FOR BREELAND </p><p> </p><p>DECL: 12356 N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, GH </p><p>SUBJECT:  GHANA:1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:   STATE 355397 </p><p> </p><p>1.  MOST OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT TERRORISM ARE NOT </p><p>PERTINENT TO THE GHANAIAN SITUATION.  HOWEVER, GHANA </p><p>HAS HAD CLOSE RELATIONS WITH LIBYA; GOOD RELATIONS </p><p>WITH IRAN, CUBA, AND NORTH KOREA; AND RECOGNIZES THE </p><p>"GOVERNMENT OF PALESTINE."  GHANA IS NOT KNOWN TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN A SPRINGBOARD FOR AN ATTACK BY A TERRORIST </p><p>GROUP, AND THE GOG IS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE ALLOWED </p><p>TERRORISTS TO OPERATE WITHIN THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>--  LIBYA:  THE DIPLOMTIC LIST SHOWS EIGHT PEOPLE </p><p>ACCREDITED TO THE PEOPLES\' BUREAU IN ACCRA; THE TOTAL </p><p>NUMBER OF LIBYANS IN-COUNTRY IS ESTIMATED AT 50. </p><p>THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>WITH LIBYAN REPRESENTATIVES SUCH AS THE GHANA LIBYAN </p><p>ARAB HOLDING COMPANY, GHANA LIBYAN ARAB MINING </p><p>COMPANY, LIBYA ARAB AGRICULTURAL HOLDING COMPANY, </p><p>VARIOUS GREEN BOOK STUDY CLUBS, AND THE </p><p>LIBYAN-SPONSORED ISLAMIC CALL SOCIETY WHLCH IS ACTIVE </p><p>ON THE RELIGIOUS FRONT.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT GHANA IS </p><p>ALSO A TRANSIT POINT FOR PEOPLE FROM OTHER PARTS OF </p><p>WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA TRAVELLING TO LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>--  PLO:  GHANA HOSTS A TWO-PERSON EMBASSY OF THE </p><p>"STATE OF PALESTINE" IN ACCRA.  PLO RECEIVES </p><p>FAVORABLE AND SYMPATHETIC PRESS COVERAGE (E.G., </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF ESTABLISHMENT OF THE "STATE OF </p><p>PALESTINE" AND ARAFAT COMMENTS ON RECENT ISRAELI </p><p>SHOOTINGS IN JERUSALEM); PLO ENVOYS ARE RECEIVED BY </p><p>CHAIRMAN RAWLINGS; AND THE PLO CONDUCTS AN ANNUAL </p><p>COMPUTER CAMP ("COMPUCAMP") ATTENDED BY YOUNG PEOPLE </p><p>FROM SEVERAL WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES.  GHANA GENERALLY </p><p>SUPPORTS PLO POSITIONS ON THE MIDDLE EAST SITUATION </p><p>IN INTERNATIONAL FORA (BUT ABSTAINS ON THE "ISRAELI </p><p>CREDENTIALS" ISSUE). </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAN HAS A SMALL BUT ACTIVE EMBASSY IN GHANA.  A </p><p>RECENT DELEGATION INITIATED AN IRAN-GHANA JOINT </p><p>COMMISSION.  IRAN PROVIDES MODEST ASSISTANCE TO THE </p><p>AGRICULTURAL AND HEALTH SECTORS, AND SPONSORS </p><p>SEMINARS FOR ISLAMIC GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>-- GHANA-CUBA RELATIONS ARE GOOD.  SEVERAL HUNDRED </p><p>GHANAIAN YOUTHS ARE STUDYING IN CUBA; GHANA HAS </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE THE CUBAN COMMITTEES FOR </p><p>DEFENCE OF THE REVOLUTION; AND GHANAIAN LEADERS </p><p>RESPECT CASTRO\'S REVOLUTIONARY STANCE.  THE CUBANS </p><p>HAVE PROVIDED SEVERAL TECHNICAL TEAMS--TEACHERS, </p><p>DOCTORS, AGRICULTURALISTS, ETC.--TO WORK IN RURAL </p><p>GHANA. </p><p> </p><p>-- NORTH KOREA HAS A SMALL EMBASSY IN ACCRA.  THERE </p><p>IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF NORTH KOREAN ASSISTANCE TO GHANA </p><p>AND DELEGATIONS HAVE EXCHANGED VISITS DURING THIS </p><p>PAST YEAR (ONE GHANAIAN DELEGATION WAS LED BY PNDC </p><p>MEMBER JUSTICE DANIEL K. ANNAN).  GHANA AND THE DPRK </p><p>HAVE A JOINT COMMISSION WHICH MEETS INFREQUENTLY. </p><p>OCCASIONALLY, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT-OWNED PRESS </p><p>CARRIES FEATURE STORIES COMMENTING FAVORABLY ON </p><p>ASPECTS OF THE NORTH KOREAN POLITICAL-ECONOMIC </p><p>SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAQ - GHANA HAS NO SUBSTANTIVE RELATIONS WITH </p><p>IRAQ AND CONDEMNED THE IRAQ INVASION OF KUWAIT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EWING </p><p></p></div>
