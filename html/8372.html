<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 OTTAWA 001543 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IFD/OIA (NEFIRD), L/CID (GLEHNER), AND WHA/CA </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/IMI - HARLOW, MATHIEU, AND ITI </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, EFIN, PGOV, KIDE, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: 2003 REPORT ON INVESTMENT DISPUTES AND </p><p>EXPROPRIATION CLAIMS:  CANADA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 83098 </p><p>     B. 02 OTTAWA 1466 </p><p> </p><p> 1. Mission Canada has updated the the non-NAFTA investment </p><p>disputes (Claimants B, F, and H) and will e-mail the text as </p><p>requested in ref A.  We have not updated the NAFTA Chapter 11 </p><p>disputes being handled by L/CID (Claimants A, C, D, E, and </p><p>G).  We are not aware of any new investor-state disputes this </p><p>past year. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Begin updated text: </p><p> </p><p>CANADA </p><p> </p><p>The United States Government is aware of eight (8) claims of </p><p>U.S. persons that may be outstanding against the Government </p><p>of Canada. </p><p> </p><p>1.  a) Claimant A </p><p>    b) 1995 </p><p> </p><p>c) In response to a price increase by Claimant A in charges </p><p>to landfill customers in Quebec, more than 20 municipalities </p><p>formed the La Mauricie Intermunicipal Waste Management </p><p>Authority (REGIE) to take control of the landfill.  Claimant </p><p>A appealed a January 1995 preliminary indemnity order for </p><p>$7.5 million (Canadian dollars), but the REGIE took </p><p>possession on May 1, 1995 and the $7.5 million was paid.  The </p><p>claimant was dissatisfied with this amount, and Quebec </p><p>Indemnity Court proceedings began in December 1995.  On </p><p>December 21, 1998, the Quebec Court Expropriation Chamber </p><p>awarded Claimant A C$24 million.  The Regie appealed this </p><p>ruling to the Quebec Court of Appeals in 1999.  Claimant\'s </p><p>legal counsel informs the Embassy that the Claimant prefers </p><p>to pursue legal remedies through the Quebec courts.  Prior to </p><p>the court decision of 1998, the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, at </p><p>Claimant\'s request, wrote Quebec provincial officials urging </p><p>resolution of the dispute.  The Quebec Court of Appeals will </p><p>not hear the case until </p><p> fall 2002 or winter 2003.  Claimant A would negotiate an </p><p>out-of-court settlement, and is passing this message through </p><p>provincial political authorities, but would insist on a </p><p>reasonable sum.  Since waste management companies and </p><p>municipal authorities in Quebec collaborate and compete, the </p><p>claimant says he will continue the suit in court because of </p><p>the precedent it may set.  Interest on the 1998 award of C$24 </p><p>million has increased the sum to C$30 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. a) Claimant B </p><p>   b) 1993 </p><p> </p><p>c) The property in question is an undeveloped 2.29 acre plot </p><p>of land, including 220 feet of beachfront on Kingsburg beach </p><p>in Nova Scotia.  The legal owner of the property is a Nova </p><p>Scotia Corporation owned by Claimant B that acquired the </p><p>property on March 3, 1993.  On March 9, 1993, the provincial </p><p>Ministry of Natural Resources declared Kingsburg beach and </p><p>its dune system "protected" under the Nova Scotia Beaches </p><p>Protection Act.  This designation prohibited development of </p><p>the property, and Claimant B contends the designation has </p><p>reduced the value of the property to zero, and amounts to a </p><p>taking of the property without compensation.  Claimant B has </p><p>not provided the U.S. Government with an estimate of the </p><p>property\'s value. </p><p> </p><p>Claimant B is one of several landowners affected by the </p><p>designation that has not resolved his dispute.  Claimant B is </p><p>prohibited from building on his property because, unlike </p><p>other landowners that have been permitted to build, he did </p><p>not have required permits in place at the time of the </p><p>designation. </p><p> </p><p>In June 1998, the provincial Supreme Court of Nova Scotia </p><p>ruled in favor of Claimant B.  The Crown appealed that </p><p>decision, however.  A court hearing date was held in May </p><p>1999, and on August 18, 1999, the Nova Scotia Court of </p><p>Appeals handed down its decision allowing the appeal and </p><p>dismissing Claimant B\'s action.  Claimant was advised by the </p><p>Court to offer the provincial government a new proposal for a </p><p>development permit that would meet environmental objections. </p><p>A new proposal was submitted in 2000, but the Nova Scotia </p><p>Ministry of Natural Resources, responding in 2001, did not </p><p>concur with the conclusions of the environmental study and </p><p>request for construction permit submitted by Claimant B. </p><p> </p><p>At the Claimant\'s request, Consulate Hallifax arranged a </p><p>meeting for the Claimant\'s representative with the provincial </p><p>Minister of Natural Resources.  At the meeting, in October, </p><p>2002, the Minister conceded that the Ministry\'s past approach </p><p>did seem unfair as it did not provide clear guidance to </p><p>landowners.  He stated that he would request a follow-up </p><p>study/report from the environmental consulting firm that </p><p>produced the original study and recommendations for </p><p>protection of the beach, with specific guidelines as to what </p><p>type of construction and land use should be permitted.  This </p><p>would provide landowners with a benchmark when submitting </p><p>development plans to the Ministry of Natural Resources. </p><p> </p><p>3. a) Claimant C </p><p>   b) 1991 </p><p>c) In 1990 Claimant C formed a joint venture with a British </p><p>Columbia (BC) company to export water from BC streams by </p><p>tanker ship to California.  According to Claimant C, the BC </p><p>Government promised the firm, orally and in writing, that it </p><p>could obtain the license required under the BC Water Act for </p><p>the purpose of export by tanker.  On March 14, 1991, the </p><p>Goleta Water District in the Santa Barbara area announced </p><p>that Claimant C and its Canadian partner had won the contract </p><p>to supply fresh water, in a competition that also included </p><p>three BC firms.  On March 18, 1991, the BC Government imposed </p><p>a moratorium on new bulk water licenses, saying it had to </p><p>review its policies; the moratorium was later extended </p><p>indefinitely.  In 1995, the BC Government enacted a Water </p><p>Protection Act that banned water export by tanker ship. </p><p> </p><p>In January 1993, Claimant C and its partner began litigation, </p><p>and in July 1995, the BC Government asked the two companies </p><p>to submit claims for a negotiated settlement.  The claim of </p><p>the Canadian Partner was settled by a cash payment in July </p><p>1996.  According to Claimant C, the BC Government has refused </p><p>to negotiate a settlement with it, and Claimant continued to </p><p>pursue litigation against the BC government until 1999.  In </p><p>December 1998, Claimant C filed notice of intent to pursue </p><p>compensation under NAFTA Chapter 11 provisions. </p><p> </p><p>In April and May 1999, Claimant C consulted with Canadian </p><p>government officials but was unable to arrive at a </p><p>resolution.  In October 1999, Claimant C filed documents </p><p>requesting arbitration under Chapter 11.  However, the </p><p>Canadian government officials found these documents lacked </p><p>certain required features that permit the Government of </p><p>Canada to organize Chapter 11 arbitration, and requested that </p><p>Claimant C resubmit them.  Claimant C resubmitted these </p><p>documents in May 2000, but the government of Canada has not </p><p>been satisfied that the requirements to initiate Chapter 11 </p><p>arbitration proceedings have been fulfilled. </p><p> </p><p>Estimates of value vary.  Claimant C\'s Canadian partner </p><p>reportedly sued for less than $1 million (Canadian Dollars) </p><p>and settled for $335,000 (Canadian).  In 1998, Claimant C </p><p>assessed its damages at between $400 and $500 million. When </p><p>filing its claim for arbitration in 1999, Claimant C assessed </p><p>its "temporary lost business opportunity" at $1.5 billion </p><p>and, in the alternative, damages for permanent lost business </p><p>at $10.5 billion. </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy in Ottawa and Consulate in Vancouver have been in </p><p>contact sporadically with Claimant C, and the Government of </p><p>Canada is aware of USG interest in the case.  In keeping with </p><p>NAFTA Chapter 11 procedures, however, the Embassy does not </p><p>take an active role on behalf of Claimant C while </p><p>consultations and dispute resolution measures are proceeding. </p><p> </p><p>4.  a) Claimant D </p><p>    b) 1998 </p><p> </p><p>c) In 1995, Claimant D solicited contracts with Canadian </p><p>companies to provide processing, transportation and disposal </p><p>of old electric transformers, which contain significant </p><p>quantities of PCB waste.  Later that year, the Government of </p><p>Canada announced a ban on the export of PCB waste.  Because </p><p>Claimant D proposed to treat the Canadian waste in the U.S., </p><p>Claimant D believes the export ban imposed a material loss to </p><p>the company.  The Canadian ban on PCB waste was in place </p><p>until February 1997, when Canada adopted new regulations </p><p>permitting exports of PCB waste to the U.S.  In July 1997, </p><p>the U.S. closed its border to imports of PCB waste.  On July </p><p>22, 1998, Claimant D announced it would seek compensation </p><p>from the Government of Canada under NAFTA Chapter 11. </p><p>Claimant D requested $20 million in compensation for business </p><p>lost due to the over one-year PCB export ban. </p><p> </p><p>This dispute became a NAFTA Chapter 11 arbitration claim when </p><p>Claimant D filed with the Canadian Government on October 30, </p><p>1988.  The Embassy continues to monitor the case, but does </p><p>not intervene with Canadian authorities while Chapter 11 </p><p>dispute resolution measures are proceeding. </p><p>In November 2000, the tribunal rendered a partial award </p><p>denying claimant\'s expropriation claim, but finding that </p><p>Canada had breached its obligations under the NAFTA\'s </p><p>national treatment and minimum standard of treatment </p><p>provisions.  A hearing on damages was held in September 2001. </p><p> The tribunal has not yet issued its decision on damages. </p><p>Canada has petitioned the federal court in Ottawa to set </p><p>aside the arbitral award. </p><p> </p><p>5.  a) Claimant E </p><p>    b) 1998 </p><p> </p><p>c) Claimant E owns and operates lumber operations in British </p><p>Columbia. In December 1998, Claimant E announced it intended </p><p>to file under NAFTA Chapter 11 provisions for compensation </p><p>from the Government of Canada.  Claimant E believes Canada </p><p>breached its NAFTA national-treatment obligations through its </p><p>implementation of the Bilateral Softwood Lumber Agreement, </p><p>which governs the export of softwood lumber manufactured in </p><p>the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and </p><p>Quebec to the United States.  The agreement imposed an export </p><p>levy once a given quota of lumber has been reached.  Claimant </p><p>E alleges that the Government of Canada acted in a manner </p><p>inconsistent with its NAFTA national-treatment obligations </p><p>because it distinguishes between investors in the four </p><p>"listed" provinces in the Softwood Lumber Agreement versus </p><p>investors in the non-listed provinces, and treated investors </p><p>in Quebec more favorably than investors in the other listed </p><p>provinces.  Claimant E also alleges that Canada failed to </p><p>accord it th </p><p>e international minimum standard of treatment. </p><p> </p><p>In March 1999, this dispute became a NAFTA Chapter 11 </p><p>arbitration claim when Claimant E officially filed a claim </p><p>with the Canadian government, seeking $382 million in </p><p>compensation for damages it claims it suffered.  The Tribunal </p><p>proceeding rejected two of Claimant E\'s allegations relating </p><p>to expropriation and performance requirements in June 2000, </p><p>and in April 2001 the tribunal rejected much of the national </p><p>treatment and minimum standard of treatment claims. </p><p> </p><p>On May 31, 2002, the Tribunal issued an award on damages with </p><p>respect to Claimant E\'s minimum standard of treatment claim. </p><p>The Tribunal ordered Canada to pay Claimant E U.S. $461,566, </p><p>with interest payable from and after May 31, 2002 at the rate </p><p>of 5% per annum compounded quarterly and pro rata within a </p><p>quarter.  Further proceedings are being held on questions as </p><p>to costs. </p><p> </p><p>Claimant E has not consulted with the U.S. Embassy or the </p><p>U.S. Consulate in Vancouver.  In keeping with USG policy, the </p><p>Embassy continues to monitor the case, but does not intervene </p><p>with Canadian authorities while Chapter 11 dispute resolution </p><p>measures are proceeding. </p><p> </p><p>6.  a) Claimant F </p><p>    b) 1995 </p><p> </p><p>c) Claimant F purchased in good faith a 32 acre parcel of </p><p>land on Prince Edward Island in 1995.  After the purchase, a </p><p>local resident successfully argued in court that he had title </p><p>to the land under the principle of adverse possession, or </p><p>"squatters\' rights."  In January 1999, the provincial Supreme </p><p>Court of Prince Edward Island ruled against Claimant F. </p><p>Claimant F believes this decision constitutes a taking of his </p><p>land by government decision.  Claimant F said he would appeal </p><p>the decision through the court system with a locally-hired </p><p>attorney.  Claimant F has not provided the U.S. Government </p><p>with an estimated value of the claim.  U.S. Consulate </p><p>personnel have not heard from Claimant F since, 1999, and </p><p>attempts to contact him have been unsuccessful. </p><p> </p><p>7.   a) Claimant G </p><p>     b) 2000 </p><p> </p><p>c) Claimant G operates an express courier delivery service </p><p>worldwide, and asserts that the Government of Canada has </p><p>allowed the Canadian Post system monopoly unfair advantages </p><p>in its competition with private sector service providers. </p><p>These advantages, Claimant G believes, take the form of </p><p>monetary subsidies from non-courier services Canada Post </p><p>provides, and discriminatory treatment by Canada customs. </p><p>Claimant G has filed for arbitration alleging the Government </p><p>of Canada breached its commitments under articles 1102, 1105, </p><p>and 1502 of the NAFTA. </p><p> </p><p>Attorneys for Claimant G have briefed the Ambassador on their </p><p>claim, and are in periodic communication with Embassy staff. </p><p>They have let the Canadian government know that they are not </p><p>averse to a non-judicial settlement of the claim through </p><p>negotiations.  The Claimant has not put a sum on the amount </p><p>of damages it claims due to Canadian government actions. </p><p> </p><p>In keeping with USG policy, the Embassy continues to monitor </p><p>the case, but does not intervene with Canadian authorities </p><p>while Chapter 11 dispute resolution measures are proceeding. </p><p> </p><p>8.  a) Claimant H </p><p>    b) 1999 </p><p> </p><p>c) Claimant H says he invested US$600,000 in prospecting for </p><p>diamonds at a site 100 miles north of Yellowknife, Northwest </p><p>Territories.  In early 1999 Claimant H says he requested the </p><p>provincial Mining Recorders Office in Yellowknife to "void" a </p><p>claim of a competing prospector because they "overstaked" on </p><p>his property.  An official of the Recorders Office claims </p><p>that the Claimant had exceeded his land use threshold, and </p><p>had not applied for a land use permit.  Claimant was arrested </p><p>as a squatter in February, 1999, detained two weeks, and </p><p>deported to the United States for overstaying.  Provincial </p><p>Mining office says Claimant made threats on the staff of the </p><p>office.  In August 1999 the property of Claimant H was </p><p>returned to him through Canada Customs. </p><p> </p><p>In July 2001 Claimant H sent a letter to the Embassy noting </p><p>his claim, and in December 2001 he retransmitted the same </p><p>information, also alleging that civic authorities conspired </p><p>to kill him to prevent his claim to discovery and ownership </p><p>of mineral deposits.  Claimant H contacted the Department in </p><p>May, 2003 to let us know he is running for Congress and to </p><p>refer us to his web site that features details of his claim. </p><p> </p><p>Claimant A: NAFTA Chpt 11 - USA Waste (formerly Waste </p><p>Management).  Claimant\'s attorney does not believe it has </p><p>signed a privacy act waiver. </p><p> </p><p>Claimant B:  William Hamilton, a private U.S. citizen who has </p><p>not signed a privacy act waiver. </p><p> </p><p>Claimant C:  NAFTA Chapter 11- Sunbelt Water, Inc., Santa </p><p>Barbara, CA.
