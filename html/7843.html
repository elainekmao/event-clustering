<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 ANKARA 002912 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MARR, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ:  LETTERS FROM TGS CHOD OZKOK TO CJCS MYERS, </p><p>CINCEUR JONES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2906 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Political-Military Affairs Counselor Stuart </p><p>Brown.  Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On May 5, 2003, the Embassy received copies of three </p><p>letters from TGS CHOD Gen. Ozkok:  (1) an April 30 letter to </p><p>CJCS Gen. Myers (see para two for text), (2) a May 1 letter </p><p>to CJCS Myers (see para three for text) and (3) a May 1 </p><p>letter to SACEUR Gen Jones (see para four for text).  The </p><p>first letter to CJCS Myers in large part focuses on northern </p><p>Iraq:  it protests the treatment of the TU special forces in </p><p>northern Iraq by US forces and seeks to explain and justify </p><p>their presence.  It also says the US and Turkey together can </p><p>discuss the re-deployment of TU forces once PKK/KADEK is </p><p>eliminated and the region is secure.  The second letter to </p><p>Gen. Myers (like the letter to SACEUR Jones) contains </p><p>Turkey\'s offer to contribute to NATO-led operations in Iraq, </p><p>and seeks NATO\'s support for use of a NATO HQs in Turkey for </p><p>this purpose.  Finally, para five contains the text of a </p><p>memorandum of record of an April 28, 2003 meeting between </p><p>Commander CJSOTF-N Col. Cleveland and Deputy Commander of TU </p><p>SF in Silopi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>OZKOK-MYERS:  TU CONCERNS ON IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Begin text of letter from TGS CHOD Gen. Ozkok to CJCS </p><p>Gen. Myers: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear General Myers, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The recent messages from the US Special Forces in northern </p><p>Iraq are not encouraging.  Hence, I would like to convey my </p><p>views to you. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As is known, there have been limited Turkish troops in </p><p>northern Iraq since 1997.  This action was fully coordinated </p><p>with the KDP and PUK.  The main purpose of this limited troop </p><p>deployment is to prevent any PKK/KADEK terrorist infiltration </p><p>into Turkey as well as early warning and intelligence </p><p>collection.  There are almost 5,000 terrorists in the region, </p><p>which pose a serious threat to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For these reasons, we, together, can evaluate the Turkish </p><p>military presence in northern Iraq after the PKK/KADEK </p><p>existence is eliminated and full control is ensured in the </p><p>region.  As assured, this contingent does not have any </p><p>negative impact on overall US operations.  It is obvious that </p><p>we can reach the desired end-state through bilateral talks on </p><p>the basis of mutual understanding and objective criteria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With this in mind, I think, the recent incident experienced </p><p>in Kirkuk was exaggerated.  Firstly, Gen. Osman,s HQs was </p><p>informed of this activity.  Secondly, everybody tends to </p><p>carry small arms in the region.  The team composed of Turks, </p><p>Kurds and Turkomans were not carrying any additional weaponry </p><p>other than ones for their own security.  When the convoy was </p><p>stopped, others came to help settle the dispute.  However, </p><p>they were misinterpreted and sent back to Turkey for very </p><p>well known reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish low profile attitude in this incident should be no </p><p>means be taken as Turkish team was mal-practicing.  On the </p><p>contrary, as stated above, the importance that we attach to </p><p>the Turkish-US relations has been the underlying factor in </p><p>the Turkish approach.  The misinterpretation and wrong </p><p>assessments by the lower echelons should not be allowed to </p><p>adversely influence our relations.  In this context, I </p><p>consider this kind of tense and subjective approaches </p><p>unacceptable for both sides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The ultimatum-like demands to be met in short time-frames may </p><p>harm our friendly relations.  We are not against each other. </p><p>Nor are our military contingents in the region.  I assume </p><p>that such unfortunate statements are due to the sentiments of </p><p>some officials who work under difficult conditions for a long </p><p>time.  The repetition of such statements creates a worrisome </p><p>atmosphere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For instance, the statements made by Col. Cleveland, 10th US </p><p>Special Forces Group Com., during the 28 April meeting in </p><p>Arbil were unacceptable.  Particularly, making any reference </p><p>to revenge what was done to Iraq Special Representative Mr. </p><p>Khalilzad and Special Forces teams at Habur Gate is </p><p>unquestionably beyond the capacity of such an officer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As is known, some of the bodyguards of Mr. Khalilzad stayed </p><p>in Iraq despite their written promises to return.  And the </p><p>Turkish officials at the border gate needed to consult their </p><p>higher authorities, which definitely took time.  During this </p><p>process, Mr. Khalilzad and his associates were hosted by the </p><p>Deputy Governor.  Consequently, he and his team were allowed </p><p>into Turkey after a short time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turning to the Special Forces issue, the authority to send </p><p>such a unit to Iraq from Turkey rests with the Turkish Grand </p><p>National Assembly.  Although I don,t have any power in the </p><p>respect, I produced after talking to you some course of </p><p>actions, which put the special forces under the scope of </p><p>already politically accepted NILE teams.  On the issue of </p><p>their prolonged stay in N.Iraq, I told that we need to </p><p>&think8, which reflects a kind of flexibility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We previously made clear statements on the locations of our </p><p>contingents in northern Iraq.  A written notification was </p><p>also made to ODC on 23 March 2003 clarifying the coordinates </p><p>of the locations.  Additionally, I personally informed </p><p>Secretary Powell that the total number of Turkish soldiers is </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>around 1500.  The detailed documentation, which included the </p><p>number of soldiers, main weaponry and combat vehicles, was </p><p>also provided upon request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I fear that minor misinterpretations and problems in the </p><p>theatre be allowed to harm our overall relations.  I believe </p><p>that we need to do our best to solve this kind of problems in </p><p>a constructive manner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Our main purpose should be to prevent any deterioration in </p><p>our relations.  I believe, as soldiers, we still have an </p><p>important role to play in this respect.  In order to avoid </p><p>similar incidents, what we need to do is to come together </p><p>with military and civilian delegations and to talk about </p><p>essential arrangements in N.Iraq.  CENTCOM involvement should </p><p>follow such initiative in the theatre. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As we have discussed previously, out activities should be </p><p>transparent in order to avoid any misunderstanding.  This is </p><p>what I also want to reiterate for this moment.  I am of the </p><p>opinion that, ultimatum-like statements, sudden and </p><p>unexpected requests are not constructive at all in promoting </p><p>our bilateral relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In conclusion, I would like to express my sincere wish that </p><p>the recent developments would not create a difficult </p><p>environment for our bilateral relations.  With this in mind, </p><p>I would like to re-emphasize my firm belief that mutual </p><p>understanding and cooperation can overcome any possible </p><p>hurdles we may face.  Hence, we must not let past events </p><p>dominate the future relations.  We stand ready for any talks </p><p>and cooperation in this direction, including possible Turkish </p><p>contribution to reconstruction phase of Iraq as well as the </p><p>establishment of Stabilization Force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>You may rest assured that I will continue to do my best to </p><p>promote our bilateral military relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CC:  General James L. Jones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>end text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>TURKEY OFFERS TO PLAY IN NATO-LED OPS IN IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Begin text of a letter dated May 1 from TGS CHOD Ozkok </p><p>to CJCS MYERS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear General Myers, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We are pleased that the war in Iraq, which is likely to have </p><p>far-reaching implications both in political and military </p><p>terms on a wider region, did not last long as a result of </p><p>rapid progress of the Coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It is inevitable, however, that the post-war period in Iraq </p><p>would bring new and demanding challenges.  This would </p><p>certainly necessitate intensified, unified and coordinated </p><p>effort by the international community, in which NATO could </p><p>and should play a much-needed role, particularly in </p><p>re-establishing durable safety, security and stability in </p><p>this war-stricken country.  Needless to say, NATO, with its </p><p>broad experience, is unquestionably capable of undertaking </p><p>such a crucial and historic role.  As a neighboring country </p><p>to Iraq that could serve as a proper line of communication, </p><p>Turkey stands ready to take part in such an operation of NATO </p><p>Council decides to. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey, while enjoying advantages of its geo-strategically </p><p>unique location, inevitably remains exposed to many regional </p><p>tensions and crises around its borders.  In the face of the </p><p>unfolding circumstances in the region, we believe NATO </p><p>headquarters in Turkey would gain even more importance in </p><p>view of handling these potential crises as well as </p><p>safeguarding and consolidating collective peace and stability </p><p>throughout the NATO,s expanding area of concern. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I would like to thank you for your firm support and </p><p>co-operation in the Operation Display Deterrence, initiated </p><p>within the framework of Article 4 of the North Atlantic </p><p>Treaty, to deter any possible hostile attempt by Iraq and </p><p>reinforce Turkey,s self-defense.  We are very pleased that </p><p>the operation has been conducted successfully with all its </p><p>assigned objectives accomplished. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I believe that the Operation Display Deterrence was also </p><p>meaningful in proving and manifesting the solidarity within </p><p>the Alliance as well as NATO,s increasing importance, as a </p><p>deterrent military organization, both on regional and global </p><p>scale. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taking this opportunity, both personally and on behalf of the </p><p>members of the Turkish Armed Forces, I would like to extend </p><p>my congtratulations for the "Armed Forces Day" to you and to </p><p>the members of the friendly and allied USA Armed Forces.  I </p><p>wish health and success to you all. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>end text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>OZKOK-JONES LETTER </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Begin text of a letter dated May 1 from TGS CHOD Ozkok </p><p>to SACEUR Jones: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear General Jones, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The last few weeks have witnessed a new hot crisis in the </p><p>Middle East, which is most likely to have far-reaching </p><p>implications, both in political and military terms, on a </p><p>wider region stretching far beyond the Iraqi borders. </p><p>Although it is early to contemplate a fully safe environment, </p><p>it is apparent that Iraq is now almost under the military </p><p>control of the Coalition troops.  This, the level of threat </p><p>posed by Iraq against Turkey has diminished to an all-time </p><p>low. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It is inevitable, however, that the post-war period in Iraq </p><p>would bring new and demanding challenges to be addressed </p><p>urgently.  This would certainly necessitate intensified, </p><p>unified and coordinated effort by the international </p><p>community, in which NATO could and should play a much-needed </p><p>role, particularly in re-establishing durable safety, </p><p>security and stability in this war-stricken country. </p><p>Needless to say, NATO, with its broad experience, is </p><p>unquestionably capable of undertaking such a crucial and </p><p>historic role.
