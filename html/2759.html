<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001168 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W </p><p>AF/DAS FOR BITRICK, ENGLE </p><p>OSC FOR WHELAN </p><p>LAGOS FOR GREANEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 18/03/02 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH NSA ALIYU </p><p>MOHAMMED TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF SECURITY ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1091 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5(B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: On April 3, Ambassador Jeter met NSA </p><p>General (Ret.) Aliyu Mohammed to raise concerns about the </p><p>lack of Nigerian support for MPRI and Operation Avid </p><p>Recovery (OAR). The Ambassador warned that obstacles faced </p><p>by the OAR EOD support team and Nigeria\'s non-payment on </p><p>MPRI are sending the wrong signals to Washington and could </p><p>threaten the future of our security assistance </p><p>relationship. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador, accompanied by Office of Defense </p><p>Cooperation Chief and Staff Assistant (Note-Taker), began </p><p>by presenting NSA Mohammed with the original letter from </p><p>POTUS to President Obasanjo offering USG assistance </p><p>following the Ikeja munitions explosions. Ambassador </p><p>expressed his desire to meet President Obasanjo before </p><p>departing for the upcoming Chief of Mission Conference in </p><p>Washington. General Mohammed agreed to try to make that </p><p>possible. (Note: The meeting did take place, see REF A) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>MPRI: </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador gave General Mohammed the unfortunate </p><p>news that MPRI had been significantly downsized and half of </p><p>the MPRI team had left Nigeria due to the funding shortfall </p><p>on the Nigerian side. Ambassador said that MPRI was on the </p><p>brink of being discontinued altogether until the GON </p><p>committed 1.5 million dollars in FMF funding to continue </p><p>MPRI with a radically reduced civil military component. </p><p>Ambassador explained that although the program continues it </p><p>was no "occasion to celebrate" because the stop-gap payment </p><p>still meant that the GON had not contributed its own funds </p><p>to the program. Ambassador Jeter warned that Nigeria\'s </p><p>failure to cost share the program may be interpreted by </p><p>Washington as a lack of commitment and threaten future </p><p>security assistance programs. Ambassador explained that the </p><p>continuance of the entire security assistance program at </p><p>existing levels in Nigeria is directly related to the </p><p>continued success of MPRI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) General Mohammed expressed disappointment that MPRI </p><p>had diminished, recalling that he "pushed the program from </p><p>the beginning".  When President Obasanjo visited Washington </p><p>prior to his inauguration in 1999, Mohammed said that he </p><p>insisted that the President visit MPRI. According to </p><p>General Mohammed, "In Washington, everything was good but </p><p>when MPRI came to Nigeria, that\'s when things went wrong." </p><p>The NSA said that there is an apparent misunderstanding </p><p>between the Service Chiefs and the MPRI personnel who run </p><p>the program. He promised to raise the issue with President </p><p>Obasanjo as soon as possible. Despite the difficulties, </p><p>Ambassador said that the U.S. is still willing to commit </p><p>the full 3.5 million if Nigeria antes up its half. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador raised additional concerns about the </p><p>transparency of the Nigerian money transfer process.  He </p><p>said we may be heading in the same direction as last year, </p><p>when Nigeria\'s MPRI payment was delayed in Nigeria\'s </p><p>Central Bank so long that the exchange rate changed leaving </p><p>a gap of nearly $319,000. The MOD now claims to have paid </p><p>the $319,000 deficit and bank statements show a transfer of </p><p>Naira from the Central Bank of Nigeria but the money has </p><p>yet to show up at the Federal Reserve account. When it does </p><p>show, Ambassador said, there will probably be another </p><p>deficit caused by exchange fluctuations (Note: The money </p><p>was subsequently received). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador asked if Mohammed knew the status of </p><p>the transfer. He responded that he did not know and </p><p>frankly, " does not understand the system either." Even 119 </p><p>billion Naira deposited by the President for GON </p><p>expenditures is caught up in the Central Bank\'s </p><p>bureaucracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Operation Avid Recovery </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador then shifted the conversation to </p><p>Operation Avid Recovery and explained the rationale for </p><p>our rapid assistance in the face of Nigeria\'s devastating </p><p>tragedy. "We did it for the obvious humanitarian reasons </p><p>but also to maintain the credibility and legitimacy of the </p><p>Nigerian military." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador said that the EOD specialists have made </p><p>significant progress in the clean up but we have reached a </p><p>crossroads in our efforts. He explained that since the EOD </p><p>team was sent here for only 60 days, their departure is </p><p>imminent. In compliance with POTUS\'s letter to President </p><p>Obasanjo, we are willing to provide contractors to finish </p><p>the job. </p><p>8. (C) The Ambassador cautioned, however, that given the </p><p>lack of cooperation received by the EOD team, the Embassy </p><p>was prepared to recommend that contractors come only if </p><p>they are promised the full cooperation of the military and </p><p>government. One of the conditions was that the </p><p>contractor\'s equipment must be imported duty free and </p><p>without complications; another was that the GON provide </p><p>the C4 to detonate munitions since the EOD team had been </p><p>using its own C4 and that supply was now exhausted. </p><p>Without a commitment to meet these conditions, Ambassador </p><p>said it would be impossible for contractors to carry out </p><p>their duties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Ambassador informed the NSA that the Ministry of </p><p>Defense is prohibiting a special EOD unit from inspecting </p><p>other potentially hazardous munition sites. The GON had </p><p>earlier asked for this assistance and we did everything to </p><p>meet this request. The GON\'s reversal sent a message of </p><p>distrust with the clear accusation that the U.S. would </p><p>engage in spying. No partnership could be based on that, </p><p>the Ambassador said. The EOD special assessment team may </p><p>leave next week if not allowed to do their job. General </p><p>Mohammed waxed philosophical by responding that human </p><p>beings and institutions fear change because they are </p><p>unsure of the outcome. Nigeria is doing its best to bring </p><p>changes but progress is slow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The NSA asked the Ambassador whether he has spoken </p><p>to MOD headquarters about the problems of access. Jeter </p><p>responded that it is one thing to speak to the MOD, it is </p><p>another to get the message to the guys on the ground. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) General Mohammed promised to raise problems with </p><p>both MPRI and OAR with President Obasanjo but cautioned </p><p>that his influence was limited. He said that the </p><p>President\'s conflicts with his own political party makes </p><p>change difficult. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Ambassador added that these issues together with </p><p>the recent media coverage of Nigeria have caused a </p><p>problematic perception in Washington. Ambassador Jeter </p><p>concluded, MPRI and OAR are success stories for the U.S. </p><p>but skepticism still existed in Washington and the absence </p><p>of Nigeria\'s full cooperation only increased the </p><p>questioning. </p><p></p></div>
