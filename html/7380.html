<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001057 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/BTA AND WHA/CAN - P.NORMAN </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR J.MELLE AND S.CHANDLER </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4320/MAC/WH/ON/OIA/BENDER </p><p> </p><p>USDOC PASS ITC - JENNINGS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/IMI - MATHIEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EFIN, CA, Trade </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE WORLD\'S TOP TRADING PARTNERSHIP </p><p>          IN THE MILLENNIUM TRADE SLUMP </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.   U.S. and world trade have declined significantly in the </p><p>past two years from their peaks in 2000.   This decline is </p><p>an unusual event which is partly explained by the </p><p>technology/telecoms crash.  The world\'s largest bilateral </p><p>trading relationship has been affected, with the value of </p><p>trade declining some seven percent over two years - a sharp </p><p>break from the performance throughout the 1990\'s.  Canada\'s </p><p>oil and gas exports to the United States have remained near </p><p>the very high levels achieved in 2000 (after several years </p><p>of impressive growth), limiting the size of the tech-driven </p><p>slump.  Canada\'s imports of pharmaceuticals grew by 90 </p><p>percent in the past four years, an expansion which cannot be </p><p>explained by domestic demand.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SPIKE-SLUMP PATTERN LAST SEEN IN EARLY 80\'S </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   While year-on-year declines in the value of U.S. </p><p>merchandise trade have been rare in recent decades, our </p><p>country\'s total trade fell by more than 7 percent over the </p><p>past two years, and exports fell by more than 11 percent. </p><p>The only comparable experience since 1960 was the period of </p><p>major rust-belt restructuring in the early 1980\'s (exports </p><p>in 1984 were 15 percent below their 1982 level).  Both of </p><p>these export slumps were preceded by export "spikes," in </p><p>which U.S. worldwide exports briefly grew by two to three </p><p>times their trend growth rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A BREAK IN THE FTA SUCCESS STORY? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.   U.S.-Canada trade - the world\'s largest two-way trading </p><p>relationship - has followed this worldwide pattern in recent </p><p>years.  The value of bilateral merchandise trade jumped by </p><p>11.5 percent in 2000 over 1999, capping a decade of </p><p>exceptional growth prompted by the 1989 FTA and the 1994 </p><p>NAFTA.  Then, from 2000 to 2002, it contracted by 7 percent </p><p>- about the same percentage as U.S. worldwide trade. </p><p> </p><p>4.   This fundamentally changes the economic environment for </p><p>this post, which (like our GOC contacts) had grown used to </p><p>boasting about our terrific continental trade performance. </p><p>We cannot blame weakness in Canada\'s economy, which has </p><p>outgrown the U.S. each year since 1998 (averaging 3.7 </p><p>percent in annual real growth versus 2.6 for the U.S).  And </p><p>trade in services, while strong, cannot make up for weakness </p><p>in the much larger merchandise sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ENERGY, AUTOS HAVE HELD UP; TECH AND TRUCKS ARE HURTING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>5.   We cannot explain the causes, or predict the </p><p>consequences, of the "millennium trade bust."  However, we </p><p>can point out some of the notable sectoral features of </p><p>bilateral trade patterns over the past five years: </p><p> </p><p>-- Annual two-way trade in computers, electronic </p><p>components and telecom equipment crashed by 47 percent </p><p>(US$14 billion) over the past two years. </p><p> </p><p>-- The acceleration in Canada\'s oil, gas and petroleum </p><p>product exports to the United States contributed to the </p><p>millennium "spike" by adding nearly US$18 billion to </p><p>our annual imports from Canada in 1999 and 2000.  But </p><p>unlike some other "boom" sectors, these flows have </p><p>since held up well:  they continued growing into 2001 </p><p>and declined only modestly in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>-- Passenger cars and trucks - the single biggest </p><p>category in U.S.-Canada trade - has also held more or </p><p>less steady.  On the other hand, two-way trade in heavy </p><p>trucks fell by 38 percent from 1999 to 2002. </p><p> </p><p>PHARMACEUTICALS:  A CLUE TO THE SCALE OF RE-IMPORTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>6.   Among major categories of U.S. exports to Canada, the </p><p>strongest percentage growth has been in pharmaceuticals. </p><p>Over the past four years (2002 over 1998), Canada\'s imports </p><p>of pharmaceuticals from the U.S. swelled by 65 percent. </p><p>Imports of pharmaceuticals from all other countries grew by </p><p>125 percent.  COMMENT:  As Canadian authorities found with </p><p>cross-border cigarette smuggling in the early 1990\'s, these </p><p>figures may provide a sense of the extent to which U.S.-made </p><p>products are being "cycled" through Canada and re-imported </p><p>to U.S. consumers. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
