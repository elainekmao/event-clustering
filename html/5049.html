<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000073 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC, PM/B, DEFENSE FOR CHAIRS, </p><p>USDP-DSCA, JOINT STAFF FOR J-5 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MASS, MCAP, PREL, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: URC-119 RADIO REQUEST FOR GUATEMALAN MILITARY </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary and Action Request:  Embassy requests State </p><p>Department and Defense Security Cooperation Agency </p><p>concurrence to transfer one URC - 119 High Frequency Radio </p><p>set to the Guatemalan Military through the Excess Defense </p><p>Articles Program. The radio\'s purpose is to enhance natural </p><p>disaster response capabilities by upgrading and better </p><p>integrating regional communications.  After careful </p><p>consideration, Post has concluded that the benefits of this </p><p>particular transfer outweigh reservations about Guatemalan </p><p>military performance on key issues.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The proposed transfer is part of a region-wide upgrade </p><p>aimed at providing an Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) </p><p>capability to the High Frequency Radio network used by the </p><p>System of Cooperation Among the American Air Forces </p><p>(SICOFAA).  ALE-capable equipment continuously assesses and </p><p>adjusts the quality of HF radio links allowing them to be </p><p>reliably used for digital data transfers.  Guatemala and </p><p>Nicaragua are the only countries in the SICOFAA system </p><p>without ALE capable HF radios.  Post understands that an URC </p><p>- 119 radio has been approved for Nicaragua.  Providing the </p><p>same ALE-capable radio to the Guatemalan Military would </p><p>significantly enhance the ability of the U.S. Air Force to </p><p>communicate and coordinate with the Guatemalan Air Force in </p><p>the event of a large-scale natural disaster.  The radio is </p><p>not well-suited for communications within Guatemala and the </p><p>possibility that it could be used for purposes other than </p><p>intended is remote. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Under current sanctions, EDA is available to Guatemala on </p><p>a case-by-case basis.  The last EDA transfer to Guatemala </p><p>occurred in 1997 and consisted of medical supplies worth 525 </p><p>thousand USD.  The value of the proposed radio transfer is </p><p>9,404 USD, broken down as follows: </p><p> </p><p>AM-7223 Amplifier             $2,269 </p><p>RF-7210A ALE (Controller)     $3,093 </p><p>RT-1446 Radio                 $4,042. </p><p> </p><p>The antenna set that is normally included in a complete URC - </p><p>119, will not be part of the proposed transfer as the </p><p>Guatemalan Air Force already has a suitable set in its </p><p>inventory. </p><p> </p><p>4. The above equipment is already physically located in </p><p>Guatemala.  It was used to provide a demonstration of ALE </p><p>capabilities during the Chiefs of American Air Forces </p><p>Conference (CONJEFAMER) held in Guatemalan on May 21, 2002, </p><p>and is currently being stored by the MilGroup Commander. </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment and Action Request:  Post carefully considered the </p><p>risk of sending mixed signals to the Guatemalan Military </p><p>before deciding to go forward with the request for </p><p>authorization to make the transfer.  Guatemala\'s significant </p><p>exposure to natural disasters and its geographic proximity to </p><p>the U.S. argue for USG efforts to mitigate such disasters </p><p>wherever it can be done in ways that do not violate other US </p><p>interests.  The proposed transfer is not precedent-setting as </p><p>EDA assistance has been provided to the Guatemalan Military </p><p>in recent years.  The chance that this system could be used </p><p>for purposes other than enhanced regional communication is </p><p>negligible.  The cost of the proposed transfer is quite small </p><p>and the equipment is already in country.  Based on these </p><p>points, Post requests Department approval to transfer this </p><p>equipment to thet Guatemalan Military.  Please advise. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
