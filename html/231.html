<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 10345 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KPAL, PGOV, PREL, JO, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  PLO AND THE INTIFADA </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  DURING A COURTESY CALL ON THE CHARGE </p><p>AUGUST 29, RATIB AMAR OF THE MFA\'S DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS, DERIDED THE "INCOMPETENCE" OF THE </p><p>PLO AND SAID THAT THE ORGANIZATION WAS LARGELY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING DISUNITY AND TENSIONS WITHIN </p><p>THE VARIOUS PALESTINIAN GROUPS IN THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES.  HE OUTLINED IN SOME DETAIL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>AMONG THOSE GROUPS.  AMAR ADDED THAT THE IDF LACKED </p><p>DISCIPLINE AND WAS NOT ADEPT AT PUTTING DOWN </p><p>DISTURBANCES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  RATIB AMAR, A RETIRED ARMY OFFICER AND, ACCORDING TO </p><p>SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES, NOW THE GID\'S (THE INTELLIGENCE </p><p>DEPARTMENT) POINT-MAN IN THE MFA\'S DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS (FORMERLY THE MINISTRY OF OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES AFFAIRS), CALLED ON THE CHARGE AUGUST 29. </p><p>AMAR, WHO HIMSELF IS FROM NEAR HEBRON, MADE NO ATTEMPT </p><p>TO HIDE HIS DISDAIN FOR THE PLO.  HIS BRIEF INCLUDED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PLO FACES A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO SHOULDER ITS </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY, I.E. DECLARE A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND PROVIDE SERVICES TO PALESTINIANS.  IF PAST </p><p>EXPERIENCE IS ANY INDICATION, IT WILL LET THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY SLIP.  (HE EXPECTS THAT WHEN THE PLO FAILS, </p><p>ITS LEADERSHIP WILL BE DESTROYED FROM WITHIN THE </p><p>OCCUPIED TERRITORIES -- BUT THE INSIDERS WILL BE </p><p>RADICALS.) </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PLO LEADERSHIP IS UNABLE TO COORDINATE RESISTANCE </p><p>ACTIVITY AND ITS INCOMPETENCE HAS CREATED SCHISMS AND </p><p>SPLITS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION.  THE ISRAELIS, AFTER A </p><p>BUNGLING START, ARE LEARNING HOW TO EXPLOIT THESE </p><p>SPLITS.  FOR EXAMPLE, ISRAELI-SPONSORED LEAFLETS ARE </p><p>BEGINNING TO APPEAR IN THE NAME OF THE INTIFADA </p><p>LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE EMERGENCE OF HAMAS (WHICH INCLUDES ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS) IS A DANGEROUS TREND.  CHRISTIANS </p><p>AND MOSLEMS HAVE LIVED PEACEFULLY TOGETHER IN THE WEST </p><p>BANK, BUT THE RELIGIOUS FERVOR OF HAMAS COULD DISRUPT </p><p>THIS HARMONY. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE EMERGENCE OF HAMAS HAS PROVOKED THE ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF A "CHRISTIAN-RESISTANCE MOVEMENT" (HAMAM) WHICH IS </p><p>NOW ACTIVE IN CHRISTIAN AREAS SUCH AS BETHLEHEM AND </p><p>RAMALLAH. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE COMMUNISTS ARE ALSO INDEPENDENTLY ACTIVE IN THE </p><p>NORTH, JERUSALEM, AND THE CHRISTIAN AREAS AS WELL.  THE </p><p>PLO HAS BOTCHED ITS ROLE OF COORDINATING THE RESISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PLO WILL BE UNABLE TO FILL THE VACUUM LEFT BY </p><p>JORDANIAN WITHDRAWAL.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE PEOPLE IN THE </p><p>OCCUPIED TERRITORIES WILL SUFFER SINCE JORDAN NO LONGER </p><p>PROVIDES NEEDED SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AMAR, A RETIRED INFANTRY BRIGADIER, WAS ALSO </p><p>CRITICAL OF THE IDF.  ACCORDING TO AMAR, THE IDF HAS </p><p>MISHANDLED THE DISTURBANCES BY USING WRONG TACTICS AND </p><p>EQUIPMENT.  AMAR CLEARLY IMPLIED THAT THE JORDANIANS </p><p>WOULD HAVE STAMPED OUT A SIMILAR DISTURBANCE MUCH </p><p>SOONER.  THE JOB CALLS FOR POLICE, NOT SOLDIERS, HE </p><p>SAID.  AS A FORMER ARMY OFFICER, AMAR WAS PARTICULARLY </p><p>UNIMPRESSED WITH THE LACK OF DISCIPLINE AMONG ISRAELI </p><p>SOLDIERS.  HE SAID THAT THE SLOVENLY APPEARANCE OF IDF </p><p>SOLDIERS NOT ONLY DOES NOT INSPIRE ANY RESPECT AMONG THE </p><p>POPULATION BUT IN FACT ENCOURAGES FURTHER </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS.  AMAR SAID THAT THE ISRAELI ARMY -- </p><p>ORGANIZED FOR WAR -- HAS BEEN SENT ON A MISSION THAT </p><p>SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR THE POLICE.  THE EFFECT WILL BE </p><p>TO REDUCE THE IDF\'S CAPABILITY AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  AMAR IS A CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF LABOR </p><p>MINISTER DUDIN (FORMER MINISTER OF OCCUPIED TERRITORIES </p><p>AFFAIRS).  AMAR\'S PAST CREDENTIALS LEND CREDIBILITY TO </p><p>HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION ON THE WEST BANK AND </p><p>GAZA.  HOWEVER, WE ARE A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THIS </p><p>UNSOLICITED BRIEFING (FOR THAT IT WAS) BY A SENIOR GOJ </p><p>OFFICIAL. </p><p> </p><p>THEROS </p><p></p></div>
