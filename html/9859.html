<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 003593 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, OES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/28/08 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, PREL, SENV, ECON, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UAE RANKS FIFTH AMONG ARAB FARM EXPORTERS -- </p><p>AT GREAT COST TO ITS WATER RESOURCES </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Local press reported last week that the UAE </p><p>ranks fifth among Arab farm exporters according to </p><p>figures released by the Arab Organization for </p><p>Agricultural Development (AOAD).  The UAE exported </p><p>products totaling approximately USD $1.59 billion in </p><p>2001, including vegetable and fruit, cereal, meat, </p><p>eggs, dairy and other products.  The 2001 export value </p><p>was nearly double the 1995 amount and was ten times </p><p>higher than the amount recorded when the UAE was </p><p>created in 1971.  The UAE has spent USD $4.2 billion </p><p>on agriculture in the last decade, increasing the </p><p>production of native and non-native crops. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The UAE\'s stunning agricultural performance </p><p>is even more remarkable -- or incongruous -- in </p><p>context: the country\'s mean annual rainfall is only </p><p>about 100 mm and 90 percent of the land mass is </p><p>situated in one of the hottest, driest deserts in the </p><p>world. The emphasis on agriculture, and the general </p><p>greening of the desert, is a direct mandate from </p><p>Shaykh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi </p><p>Emirate and President of the UAE since its inception. </p><p>Shaykh Zayed has said, "Give me agriculture, and I </p><p>give you civilization" -- and the Emiratis have taken </p><p>this doctrine to heart.  According to UAEG estimates, </p><p>there are approximately 36,000 farms in the country </p><p>(up from about 11,000 in 1980), ranging in size from </p><p>2.5-4 hectares. Abu Dhabi Emirate, which includes Al </p><p>Ain, the ancestral home of the ruling Al-Nahyan </p><p>family, has two-thirds of the farms in the country. </p><p>There are usually four wells per farm in Abu Dhabi, </p><p>with no licensing procedures for drilling. Wells are </p><p>drilled either privately or with the assistance of the </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment: The expansion of agriculture has had a </p><p>tremendous impact on the UAE\'s limited groundwater </p><p>resources.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) </p><p>estimated in 1995-96 that groundwater reserves would </p><p>be depleted in 10-25 years and brackish water would be </p><p>depleted in 200 years. Though the UAEG still estimates </p><p>that groundwater will be depleted within ten years, </p><p>USGS now estimates that groundwater reserves will </p><p>probably be depleted within five years. Embassy </p><p>interlocutors told Econoff that UAE agriculture is </p><p>increasingly dependent on desalinated water, </p><p>especially in Abu Dhabi Emirate. Abu Dhabi currently </p><p>has six desalination plants, with a seventh to come </p><p>on-line in 2004, with daily usage around 300 million </p><p>gallons per day.  The UAE has the second highest per </p><p>capita water usage in the world after the United </p><p>States, a figure skewed in part by the excessive </p><p>amount of water used for agriculture. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
