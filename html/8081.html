Erdogan said </p><p>Turkey would provide U.S. with the necessary support in the </p><p>struggle against terrorism, and added that Foreign Minister </p><p>Gul would pay a visit to Israel and Palestine soon in an </p><p>effort to help a solution to the Middle East problem. </p><p>Papers comment that the phone call helped in repairing the </p><p>damage in Turkish, American relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey, U.S. `secret\' talks on PKK/KADEK: Broadcasters </p><p>report that CIA and Turkey\'s intelligence agency MIT have </p><p>started secret talks for disarmament of PKK/KADEK militia in </p><p>Northern Iraq.  The U.S. is getting ready to launch an </p><p>operation to disarm PKK members, which might force </p><p>terrorists to flee to Turkey, the report says.  No agreement </p><p>is reached yet in the talks between Turks and Americans, but </p><p>Ankara is about to pass a `repentance law\' for terror group </p><p>defectors, the report notes.  Papers report Foreign Minister </p><p>Gul as saying that the PKK/KADEK, which is on the U.S. list </p><p>of terror groups, maintained about 4,000 armed militants in </p><p>Northern Iraq, and that Americans would not remain </p><p>indifferent to the group\'s activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wolfowitz; Rice: A "Hurriyet" commentary does not find </p><p>convincing enough Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz\'s </p><p>refuting of allegations that he told Turkey to apologize for </p><p>not supporting the U.S. in the war with Iraq.  The article </p><p>claims Wolfowitz has humiliated Turkey by suggesting `U.S. </p><p>will set the limits of Turkey\'s relations with Iran and </p><p>Syria, all Turkey will have to do is implement it.\'  On the </p><p>other hand, all papers report National Security Advisor Rice </p><p>as saying that U.S. and Turkey, having common strategic </p><p>interests, would continue working together after a period of </p><p>difficulty in relations.  Reports point to the timing of the </p><p>Rice statement which arrived just after the condolences call </p><p>by Prime Minister Erdogan to President Bush for Riyadh </p><p>bombings.  Meanwhile, a "Milliyet" report from Washington </p><p>claims that the Pentagon has instructed U.S. companies to </p><p>refrain from giving potential Turkish sub-contractors large </p><p>shares in Iraq reconstruction jobs.  An unidentified owner </p><p>of a giant Turkish construction company told the paper that </p><p>Ankara should convince the Pentagon to cease `punishing\' </p><p>Turks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S., Turkey QIZ agreement shelved: All papers report that </p><p>the Turkey-Israel-U.S. Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) </p><p>project, modeled on the U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli free trade </p><p>zones has been shelved by the U.S. Congress.  Negotiations </p><p>on the QIZ might resurrect at a new U.S., Turkey economic </p><p>meeting in U.S. in Autumn this year, papers expect.  Reports </p><p>have surmized that the suspension was a U.S. attempt to </p><p>punish Turkey for non-cooperation in the war against Iraq. </p><p>By refusing to grant U.S. troops transit passage to Iraq, </p><p>Turkey has lost hopes for fresh privileges in textile </p><p>exports to the U.S., papers comment.  However, some papers </p><p>have recognized that the aggressive campaign for the </p><p>inclusion of textile products within the QIZ agreement was </p><p>the main source of discordance between the sides, even </p><p>before the Parliament\'s decision not to permit a northern </p><p>front. Some leading Turkish businessmen complain that Turkey </p><p>has lost its privileged status in the American eye.  Turkish </p><p>Exporters\' Union (TIM) called for, if the crisis is not </p><p>sorted out, increase of Turkish customs on U.S.-made </p><p>products, to the same level applied on Turkish products to </p><p>the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p>a) US-EU/Turkey </p><p>b) Riyadh Bombings </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is Kemalism the main obstacle for Turkey in its relations </p><p>with the US and EU?" </p><p>Murat Yetkin argued in liberal-intellectual Radikal (5/15): </p><p>"Even though there has not been any official-level </p><p>confirmation, the US and EU have a common objection about </p><p>Turkey.  The common point is that Kemalist ideology itself </p><p>and the bureaucracy as this ideology\'s staunch supporter </p><p>constitute a major problem for Turkey\'s ties with the West. </p><p>Kemalist ideology is the reason for recent US reactions to </p><p>Turkey as well as for criticism coming from EU countries. . </p><p>Similar arguments can also be seen in a recent London-based </p><p>IISS report, which talks about the possibility of the </p><p>Turkish army\'s intervention if the ruling AKP attempts to </p><p>change the system.  For instance, a recent article by Sedat </p><p>Ergin in `Hurriyet\' noted that Assistant Secretary of </p><p>Defense Wolfowitz was blaming the army for troubles in </p><p>Turkish-American relations and was defending AKP. Why? Many </p><p>observers believe that the US sees the Kemalist bureaucracy </p><p>as the source of all troubles. Washington allegedly </p><p>considers the AKP as an antidote against the Kemalist </p><p>bureaucracy.  Therefore, both Wolfowitz and Grossman, who </p><p>are known as friends of Turkey, accused the Turkish army and </p><p>not the AKP government for the Iraqi crisis in Turkish- </p><p>American relations. . Who represents the Kemalist </p><p>bureaucracy? It seems it contains TGS, MFA and some judicial </p><p>circles. . Although Kemalism as well as Kemalist bureaucracy </p><p>are named as the essence of problems vis--vis Turkey\'s </p><p>relations with the US and EU, the Western decision makers </p><p>are using this argument in order to disguise the main area </p><p>for criticism, which is military-government relations in </p><p>Turkey.  The US so far has been carrying out the debate </p><p>behind the closed doors in order not to challenge with the </p><p>Turkish army.  However, the EU has started making the same </p><p>debate publicly. . As part of Turkey\'s EU integration </p><p>procedures, the role of the army in Turkey\'s administration </p><p>style will eventually and inevitably be brought up. </p><p>Therefore, a discussion should start by naming clearly as </p><p>`the army-government relations\' instead of creating pretexts </p><p>such as Kemalism." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Impasse for the Saudis" </p><p>Soli Ozel commented in mass appeal Sabah (5/15): "The Bush </p><p>administration used three justifications before launching </p><p>the war against terrorism, of which Iraq was the first </p><p>target.  Al Qaida is finished.  The military operation </p><p>against Iraq will bring stability to the region.  American </p><p>presence in the region will play a deterrent role against </p><p>terrorist acts. . However the Riyadh bombings seem to be </p><p>proving otherwise.  This event also raises concerns about </p><p>Riyadh-Washington relations.  . The events of September 11 </p><p>posed a serious blow to the special relationship between the </p><p>US and Saudi Arabia since 1945.  Right after the 9/11 </p><p>attacks, there has been very strong anti-Saudi rhetoric in </p><p>the US.  Comments and speculations included even the need </p><p>for the toppling of the Riyadh regime, which represents </p><p>radical fundamentalism and support for terrorist groups. . </p><p>Today the Saudi regime is trapped between Al Qaida\'s </p><p>aggression and the US pressure on Riyadh for change its </p><p>style.  It remains to be seen whether the Saudi dynasty will </p><p>be able to overcome this critical time." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
