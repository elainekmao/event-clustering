<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000575 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 04-03-13 </p><p>TAGS: CE, MV, AGMT, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 52  (04-03-03) </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Wills, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  SRI LANKAN TEA REQUEST - URGENT </p><p>-          LOCAL IRAQ REACTION </p><p>-          SLMM RAISES NOTION OF A "THIRD FORCE" </p><p>-          PRESIDENT THREATENS TAKEOVER OF MINISTRIES </p><p>-          SECURITY ZONE ISSUE IN THE NEWS </p><p> </p><p>SRI LANKAN TEA REQUEST - URGENT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>1. (U) Colombo 561 described GSL\'s request that the US </p><p>buy Sri Lankan tea for humanitarian aid to Iraq.  The </p><p>Ambassador needs to have an answer to this action request </p><p>by Friday Sri Lanka time so he can get back to the </p><p>requesting Ministry.  We understand this isn\'t much time </p><p>to get Washington to act on a request, but we really do </p><p>need you to press the relevant offices for an answer </p><p>before COB Thursday Washington time, so the Ambassador </p><p>will be able to give GSL an answer on Friday our time. </p><p>(ECON) </p><p> </p><p>LOCAL IRAQ REACTION </p><p>------------------- </p><p>2.  (C) Local reaction re Iraq remains muted.  We have </p><p>not heard of any anti-war demonstrations planned for </p><p>Colombo or its immediate environs.  We imagine that there </p><p>will be something after Muslim prayers this Friday.  Some </p><p>sort of demonstration is being planned for Kandy.  We </p><p>also heard a report, which we seek to confirm, that there </p><p>might be an anti-war rally in Jaffna this week.  Pls see </p><p>our latest cable re press coverage, which continues to be </p><p>heavy. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) By the way, per a class e-mail note from the SA </p><p>Front Office sent to South Asia posts, we just want to </p><p>note that we have not (repeat not) had any indication </p><p>(nor heard any reports) that Sri Lankans might be leaving </p><p>for Iraq to fight for the remnants of the Saddamite </p><p>regime.  (POL/RSO) </p><p> </p><p>SLMM RAISES NOTION OF A "THIRD FORCE" </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>4.  (C) FYI.  Recent statements by the Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM), bizarrely, are hinting that </p><p>some sort of non-LTTE, non-GSL "third force" may have </p><p>been involved in instigating the recent sea </p><p>confrontations off the northeast coast.  In its press </p><p>release re the March 20 sinking of a Chinese fishing </p><p>trawler and re the March 31 attack on a SLN troop ship </p><p>(see Reftels), the SLMM stated that it "cannot rule out </p><p>the possibility that armed elements - not recognized by </p><p>the parties" were involved.  No one here in Sri Lanka </p><p>knows what the SLMM may be referring to, as no one knows </p><p>of any potential "armed elements" outside of the </p><p>government and the LTTE.  Based on our discussions with </p><p>the SLMM, we think the group, in wimpy, overly diplomatic </p><p>fashion, does not want to blame the LTTE directly, so </p><p>they are putting up this straw man of other "armed </p><p>elements."  Everyone else here is calling a spade a </p><p>spade.  One Icelandic member of the SLMM mumbled darkly </p><p>that perhaps the Indians might have been involved (we </p><p>doubt that) or that an element of the Sea Tigers not </p><p>under the control of the LTTE might have carried it out. </p><p>(POL/DAO) </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT THREATENS TAKEOVER OF MINISTRIES </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>5.  (C) FYI.  President Kumaratunga has recently stated </p><p>that she might take over some of the government\'s </p><p>ministries.  Her particular animus is focused on the </p><p>Ministry of Civil Aviation and Ministry of Information. </p><p>In attacking these ministries, Kumaratunga is accusing </p><p>the director of the international airport of being </p><p>connected to the LTTE (he has a bad reputation, but we\'re </p><p>unsure of this charge) and the Information Ministry of </p><p>being anti-PA.  We are not sure how serious CBK is about </p><p>these threats, but, based on what we are hearing, the </p><p>mere mention is sparking additional cohabitation </p><p>stresses.  By the way, if CBK took the plunge, we are not </p><p>sure of the exact mechanics of such a move, though we are </p><p>sure it would wind up in the courts.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) By the way, the Ambassador is slated to meet </p><p>President Kumaratunga tomorrow (April 4) at 10:30 A.M. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY ZONE ISSUE IN THE NEWS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>7.  (U) FYI.  In response to continued criticism re the </p><p>Jaffna security zone issue, the military has said it is </p><p>willing to move some of its troops from hotels and other </p><p>buildings in Jaffna city.  In making this proposal, the </p><p>military has proposed moving into the Jaffna municipal </p><p>council area and other buildings near that site.  While </p><p>somewhat happy that the military is even discussing the </p><p>matter, Tamils are urging the GSL to do more and think </p><p>about getting the troops out of Jaffna city altogether. </p><p>LTTE supporters, as you would guess, remain quite </p><p>vociferous on this issue.  The positive news on all this </p><p>is that folks are discussing these issues.  We expect </p><p>that retired Indian General Nambiar\'s report on the </p><p>issue, when it is out and in the press (which it is not </p><p>as of yet), will stimulate further discussion.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
