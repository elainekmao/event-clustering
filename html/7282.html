<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0101 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          APRIL 09, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 09, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Cumhuriyet: It is reported that KDP leader </p><p>Mesut Barzani has been directing Turkomen </p><p>refugees to Turkey, in an effort to influence </p><p>northern Iraq\'s demographics in favor of the </p><p>Kurds. It is claimed that Barzani, in order not </p><p>to give Turkey a chance to penetrate into </p><p>Northern Iraq, has been keeping the Kurds who </p><p>would like pass into Turkey in northern Iraq by </p><p>force of arms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Bolge: Adana affiliates of the Turkish </p><p>Transportation-Union left a black wreath at US </p><p>Consulate Adana yesterday. Around 20 </p><p>demonstrators holding flags and banners gathered </p><p>across from the Consulate, where police had taken </p><p>stringent security measures. The crowd shouted </p><p>slogans such as "Oil is magnificent; Saddam is a </p><p>pretext," "No to war," and "Damn America." </p><p>Holding a press conference at the scene, the </p><p>President of the Adana chapter of the union, </p><p>Orhan Yavuz, said that the US was testing out its </p><p>weaponry on the people of Iraq. He urged </p><p>consumers and shopkeepers not to buy US and </p><p>Jewish products, because each penny they </p><p>(Americans and Jews) made from such trade </p><p>returned to them as bullets, tanks, missiles, </p><p>bombs, and chemical weapons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Evrensel: Adana DEHAP will hold its 3rd </p><p>Ordinary Convention on April 19, 2003. DEHAP\'s </p><p>Provincial Chairman, Mehmet Cancelik, said </p><p>priority should be given to resolving the Kurdish </p><p>and Palestinian issues in a fair, democratic, and </p><p>peaceful manner in order to bring lasting peace </p><p>and order to the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Cumhuriyet: The "Coordination Center" planned </p><p>to be established between Turkey, the US, and </p><p>northern Iraqi groups has not become operational </p><p>yet. It is reported that the Kurdish groups and </p><p>the Turkomen have each reported to Washington and </p><p>Ankara two names designated for the unit, and </p><p>Turkey has been considering "a retired soldier" </p><p>and a diplomat for the slots. Should Washington </p><p>give the nod to formation of the "Coordination </p><p>Center" this week, then the representatives will </p><p>be able to congregate in Silopi next week. Their </p><p>activities will be restricted to migration, </p><p>humanitarian relief, and resolution of possible </p><p>disputes between factions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Milliyet: With completion of the mission of </p><p>ONW, which was first set up at Incirlik AFB right </p><p>after the 1991 Gulf War, all of the planes </p><p>deployed at the base for that purpose have now </p><p>left Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Milliyet: The port of Mersin is being </p><p>evacuated by the US. A Spanish flag-carrier </p><p>freighter docked at Mersin port to take back </p><p>military and medical equipment, as well as some </p><p>86 containers of humanitarian relief, all of </p><p>which had been unloaded at the port some time </p><p>ago. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Cumhuriyet/Evrensel: The Americans are </p><p>continuing to send the equipment at bases in </p><p>Mardin to Iskenderun port and Incirlik AFB. The </p><p>lease term for Iskenderun port has been extended </p><p>until April 18 for an additional USD 2 million. </p><p>Facilities rented in Kiziltepe by the US were </p><p>turned over to the owners. In Nusaybin, the </p><p>President of Merchants and Craftsmen Association </p><p>said they were trying to complete the </p><p>construction of the Industrial Zone with the </p><p>money they earned from the US for rent; the US </p><p>left the bases in Nusaybin some time ago. In </p><p>Sirnak, 47 reporters from various news agencies - </p><p>- including TRT, Star, IHA, Show-TV, Channel 7, </p><p>Channel D, Yeni Safak, NTV, CHA, STV, and BBC -- </p><p>filed petitions through the Press Center set up </p><p>in Cizre with the Sirnak Governorate and the </p><p>Cizre Sub-Governorate to facilitate working </p><p>conditions in the region. In their petitions, the </p><p>reporters demanded to be allowed to work without </p><p>hindrance along the Sirnak-Hakkari line that </p><p>forms the border with northern Iraq, as well as </p><p>to be allowed to cross into northern Iraq via the </p><p>Habur Border Gate in order to observe the </p><p>humanitarian relief and refugee conditions in </p><p>northern Iraq. Currently Habur Border gate has </p><p>been sealed off and some regions have been </p><p>declared a "special military zone." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Cumhuriyet: Because of increased military </p><p>activity in northern Iraq, Turkey has put out the </p><p>alarm for a possible wave of refugees. Following </p><p>the accord made with Secretary of State Powell </p><p>concerning relief assistance to Iraq, some 500 </p><p>tons of foodstuffs were brought to Dohuk by 20 </p><p>Turkish trucks. The UN also purchased 6,244 tons </p><p>of flour from Turkey. Foodstuffs for 25,000 </p><p>people -- along with tents, blankets, and mobile </p><p>kitchens for 50,000 people -- were dispatched to </p><p>Silopi, which has been designated as the </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Center in </p><p>Turkey. Foodstuffs that would suffice for 100,000 </p><p>people are being kept in Turkish Red </p><p>Crescent(Kizilay) warehouses.  Some 30 Turkish </p><p>deputy governors who have been trained in </p><p>humanitarian relief issues are stationed in </p><p>Diyarbakir, Gaziantep, and Silopi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Turkiye: It was announced by the Diyarbakir </p><p>Security Directorate that three alleged PKK </p><p>members were arrested on charges of transferring </p><p>materiel to PKK militants in rural areas and </p><p>harboring them. The three members of the </p><p>organization were ordered held by the court </p><p>following conclusion of their interrogation at </p><p>the security directorate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Turkiye: Based on a tip, jandarma arrested </p><p>three persons in possession of historical items </p><p>from the Urartian period (9th century BCE) in </p><p>Malazgirt (Mus). It is reported that the market </p><p>value of the items was somewhere between USD 150- </p><p>180,000. The interrogation of the detainees is </p><p>ongoing. </p><p>12.  Evrensel: Distribution of magazines </p><p>published by student organizations at Cukurova </p><p>University (Adana) is being blocked on minor </p><p>pretexts by the university rector, who claims </p><p>that there should be only one publication at the </p><p>university. Magazines freely sold in town are </p><p>prohibited at the university. Two seniors at the </p><p>Faculty of Philosophy who are members of the </p><p>"Gara Writing Club" -- Nurhan Ozgun and Mustafa </p><p>Esme -- said they probably would face </p><p>interrogation for publishing the 2nd issue of the </p><p>magazine titled "Gara." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Bolge/Turkiye/Hurriyet: A trade delegation </p><p>from Adana set off for a four-day trip to Greece. </p><p>The President of the Adana Chamber of Industry, </p><p>Umit Ozgumus, said they would make every effort </p><p>to promote cooperation between businessmen in </p><p>both countries, and added that they benefited </p><p>greatly from a similar visit to Syria last year. </p><p>18 representatives from the metal-machinery </p><p>sector, 13 from food processing, 10 from </p><p>textiles, 10 from forest products and furniture, </p><p>9 from cotton-ginning, 7 from construction, and 5 </p><p>from various other sectors are taking the trip, </p><p>which is headed by the Governor of Adana, Kemal </p><p>Onal. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
