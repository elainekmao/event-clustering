<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 JAKARTA 004285 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/05/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, PGOV, ID </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR CALLS ON JUSUF KALLA </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER ANDREW T. HINTZ FOR </p><p>REASON 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: THE AMBASSADOR TOLD PEOPLES\' WELFARE </p><p>COORDINATING MINISTER YUSUF KALLA ON NOVEMBER 30 THAT THE </p><p>U.S. WANTS TO HELP INDONESIA SOLVE SEPARATIST AND OTHER </p><p>CHALLENGES.  KALLA SAID RECENTLY PASSED AUTONOMY LAWS WOULD </p><p>ADDRESS MOST SEPARATIST DEMANDS, BUT THAT INGRAINED DISTRUST </p><p>WOULD BE HARD TO OVERCOME. THE AMBASSADOR PRESSED KALLA ON </p><p>COMBATING EXTREMIST GROUPS LIKE LASKAR JIHAD (LJ).  KALLA </p><p>SAID THAT LJ WAS NOT ENTIRELY TO BLAME FOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>CONFLICTS; HE SAID THE GOI HAD FORMED A MULTI-SERVICE JOINT </p><p>BATTALION TO QUELL FIGHTING IN THE MOLUCCAS.  KALLA SAID TO </p><p>FIGHT POVERTY THE GOI SHOULD FOCUS ON WEALTH DISPARITY, WHILE </p><p>CHANNELING FOREIGN INVESTMENT TOWARD PRIVATIZATION OF </p><p>STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES.  KALLA SAID THE GOI SUPPORTS THE WAR </p><p>ON TERRORISM, AND THAT HE PERSONALLY HAD DEFLECTED CRITICISM </p><p>OF THE US-LED MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN AFGHANISTAN.  KALLA IS A </p><p>THOUGHTFUL INTERLOCUTOR, BUT HIS COMMENTS BETRAYED A </p><p>RELUCTANCE (COMMON AMONG INDONESIAN OFFICIALS) TO ADDRESS </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES IN RESOLVING SEPARATIST AND SECTARIAN </p><p>CONFLICTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>US SUPPORT FOR INDONESIA AFFIRMED </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DURING HIS NOVEMBER 30 INTRODUCTORY CALL ON PEOPLE\'S </p><p>WELFARE COORDINATING MINISTER YUSUF KALLA, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>STRESSED US SUPPORT FOR INDONESIA\'S NATIONAL INTEGRITY.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE USG HAS CONSISTENTLY CONVEYED ITS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR A UNITED INDONESIA TO SEQRATIST GROUPS LIKE THE </p><p>FREE ACEH MOVEMENT (GAM).  THE AMBASSADOR OPINED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THE PEACE PROCESS IN WEST PAPUA IS MUCH FURTHER ALONG </p><p>THAN IN ACEH.  HE NOTED THAT THE REGIONAL AUTONOMY </p><p>LEGISLATION FOR PAPUA WAS FAR MORE INCLUSIVE THAN THAT FOR </p><p>ACEH THANKS TO THE PAPUAN PUBLIC\'S BROADER INPUTS IN THE </p><p>DRAFTING PROCESS.  THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT, IN ACEH, GAM </p><p>HAD DRIVEN THE DEBATE EVEN THOUGH GAM DOES NOT FULLY </p><p>REPRESENT THE ACHENESE PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ALSO STRESSED THAT, WHILE UNWILLING TO </p><p>BECOME DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN MEDIATING SEPARATIST CONFLICTS </p><p>LIKE ACEH, THE U.S. IS KEEN TO HELP INDONESIA RESOLVE SUCH </p><p>ISSUES PEACEFULLY.  THE AMBASSADOR ADDED HE WAS TROUBLED BY </p><p>REPORTS THAT THE GOI WAS POISED TO PURSUE A MILITARY SOLUTION </p><p>IN ACEH, WHERE INDONESIA WAS SAID TO BE DEPLOYING SEVERAL </p><p>EXTRA BATTALIONS OF TROOPS.  HE ADVISED KALLA THAT THE </p><p>POLICE, AND NOT THE ARMED FORCES (TNI), SHOULD HAVE THE LEAD </p><p>IN RESTORING ORDER IN THE PROVINCE, AND NOTED THAT THE US </p><p>COULD HELP STRENGTHEN POLICE CAPABILITIES THROUGH ITS LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>KALLA SEES SALVATION IN LEGISLATION </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WHILE ADMITTING THAT INDONESIAN NATIONAL UNITY IS </p><p>THREATENED BY SIGNIFICANT CENTRIFUGAL FORCES, KALLA SAID THAT </p><p>VARIOUS REGIONAL AUTONOMY BILLS NOW BEFORE PARLIAMENT WOULD </p><p>ADDRESS MOST SEPARATIST DEMANDS.  HE ADDED THAT THIS WAS </p><p>PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR ACEH, WHERE HE CLAIMED THE DRAFT LAW </p><p>ACCOUNTED FOR ALL SALIENT ISSUES, INCLUDING REVENUE SHARING </p><p>AND IMPOSITION OF ISLAMIC (SYARIAH) LAW (HE NOTED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THERE STILL IS NO CLEAR DEFINITION OF THE LATTER).  KALLA </p><p>NEVERTHELESS CONCEDED THAT, IN THE CASE OF ACEH, A NEGOTIATED </p><p>SETTLEMENT MIGHT BE STYMIED BY AN ACUTE LACK OF TRUST ON BOTH </p><p>SIDES.  HE OPINED THAT THIS WOULD BE NO LESS TRUE OF THE </p><p>POLICE, WHOSE HARDLINE MINDSET, HE BELIEVED, WOULD TAKE </p><p>CONSIDERABLE TIME TO CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AGREEING WITH THE AMBASSADOR\'S VIEW THAT GAM DOES NOT </p><p>TRULY REPRESENT THE ACEHNESE PEOPLE, KALLA DESCRIBED MANY OF </p><p>GAM\'S MEMBERS AS RADICALIZED WAR-ORPHANS WHO HAVE TURNED TO </p><p>BANDITRY UNDER THE GAM BANNER.  KALLA SAID THAT, BY CONTRAST, </p><p>THE PAPUANS ARE NOT COMMITTED TO ARMED STRUGGLE, BEING LESS </p><p>EDUCATED AND ENJOYING A RELATIVELY EASY LIFESTYLE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HE DISMISSED REPORTS OF AN INCREASE IN TNI DEPLOYMENTS TO </p><p>ACEH AS "DISINFORMATION," NOTING THAT, GIVEN DEPLOYMENTS </p><p>ELSEWHERE, THE FIGURES OFTEN CITED WERE IN EXCESS OF THE </p><p>TOTAL NUMBER OF BATTALIONS FIELDED BY TNI. </p><p> </p><p>IDPS AND LASKER JIHAD </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY ON THE GOI\'S </p><p>PLANS FOR HANDLING THE CHALLENGE POSED BY INDONESIA\'S 1.3 </p><p>MILLION INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS), KALLA NOTED THAT </p><p>IDPS RESULTED OF THREE TYPES OF REGIONAL CONFLICT: ETHNIC, </p><p>RELIGIOUS, AND POLITICAL.  THE MINISTER SAID THAT, WHILE ALL </p><p>WERE DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE, RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS POSED THE </p><p>GREATEST PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY OFFERED LITTLE </p><p>COMMON GROUND FOR COOPERATION AND RECONCILIATION.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE PROBLEM OFTEN WAS EXACERBATED BY ETHNIC AND ECONOMIC </p><p>FACTORS, AND CITED THE MOLUCCAS AS AN EXAMPLE.  KALLA SAID </p><p>THAT THE LOCAL MERCHANT CLASS WAS DOMINATED BY BUGINESE OR </p><p>BUTONESE MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS, WHILE MOST LOCAL CHRISTIANS HAVE </p><p>TRADITIONALLY OPTED FOR LESS LUCRATIVE CALLINGS AS PLANTATION </p><p>LABOR OR IN THE BUREAUCRACY.  HE CLAIMED THE GOI WAS </p><p>NEVERTHELESS PREPARED TO TAKE FIRM STEPS TO QUELL THE </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THE MALUKUS, NOTING THAT A MULTI-SERVICE "JOINT </p><p>BATTALION" HAD BEEN SPECIALLY FORMED BY TNI FOR THE TASK.  HE </p><p>CONCEDED, HOWEVER, THAT LITTLE TRUST REMAINED BETWEEN THE </p><p>COMMUNITIES, AND THAT DIVISIONS WOULD PERSIST INDEFINITELY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WHEN QUERIED BY THE AMBASSADOR ON LASKAR JIHAD\'S ROLE </p><p>IN PROLONGING THE VIOLENCE AND GOI STEPS TO REIN IN SUCH </p><p>GROUPS, KALLA REJOINED THAT GROUP WAS NOT ENTIRELY TO BLAME. </p><p>A BUGINESE MUSLIM HIMSELF, THE MINISTER CONTENDED THAT </p><p>CHRISTIAN MILITANTS FROM ACROSS INDONESIA, PARTICULARLY </p><p>SUMATRAN BATAKS, ALSO HAVE TRAVELED TO AREAS OF SECTARIAN </p><p>STRIFE LIKE THE MALUKUS AND CENTRAL SULAWESI.  KALLA </p><p>NEVERTHELESS EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT THE "JOINT BATTALION" </p><p>WOULD NEUTRALIZE SUCH INTERVENTION IN THE MALUKUS.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT IN CENTRAL SULAWESI, HOWEVER, THE FIGHTING HAD RESULTED </p><p>IN 100-120,000 IDPS IN THE VICINITY OF PALU, MOST OF WHOM </p><p>WERE HOUSED IN MAKESHIFT CAMPS, SCHOOLS, OR WITH RELATIVES. </p><p>KALLA SAID THE GOI WAS TRYING TO ASSIST THEM, AS WELL AS TO </p><p>INDUCE THEM TO RETURN HOME TO AVOID CONFLICT WITH LOCAL </p><p>RESIDENTS.  HE ADDED THAT MUCH THE SAME WAS TRUE OF MADURESE </p><p>IDPS IN CENTRAL KALIMANTAN, NOTING THE ISSUE HAD GREATLY </p><p>IMPROVED WITH THE RETURN TO MADURA OF MOST OF THE IDPS, AND </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURE\'S PROMULGATION OF LAWS REGULATING </p><p>COMMUNITY RELATIONS.  KALLA SQUARELY BLAMED THE MADURESE FOR </p><p>THE VIOLENCE THAT HAD BEFALLEN THEM, HOWEVER, DESCRIBING </p><p>THEIR CULTURE AND PROCLIVITY TO FORM GANGS (PARTICULARLY </p><p>THOSE "FROM SURABAYA") AS "TOO STRONG" FOR LOCAL </p><p>SENSITIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>POVERTY ALLEVIATION: A NEW TACK </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) KALLA RESPONDED TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION ABOUT </p><p>GOI\'S POVERTY ALLEVIATION STRATEGY BY SAYING THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SHOULD FOCUS PRIMARILY ON EQUITY ISSUES.  NOTING THE GOI </p><p>PREVIOUSLY RELIED ON GROWTH-BASED DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES THAT </p><p>ULTIMATELY BENEFITED ONLY THE ELITES, KALLA ARGUED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT NOW NEEDED TO CREATE EQUITY THROUGH INCOME GROWTH </p><p>STRATEGIES: </p><p> </p><p>--THIS, HE EXPLAINED, COULD BE ACHIEVED AT THE "MICRO" LEVEL </p><p>BY DEVELOPING SMALL ENTERPRISES, AGRICULTURE, AND SOCIAL </p><p>WELFARE AND HEALTH SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>--AT THE "MACRO" LEVEL, KALLA SAID, EXISTING INVESTMENT (NO </p><p>NEW INVESTMENT WOULD BE NEEDED) COULD BE BETTER CHANNELED TO </p><p>BENEFIT THE PEOPLE BY TARGETING SECTORS THAT WOULD SPUR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF INDONESIA\'S DOMESTIC MARKET, AND TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF THE PUBLIC\'S INCREASED PURCHASING POWER. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) KALLA SAID THAT FOREIGN INVESTMENT SHOULD BE DEVOTED </p><p>TO PRIVATIZING EXISTING ENTERPRISES, RATHER THAN THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW ONES.  HE NOTED THAT THE LAST THING THE </p><p>COUNTRY NEEDED WAS ANOTHER FIVE-STAR HOTEL.  WHILE CONCEDING </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR\'S POINT THAT THE SEMEN GRESIK SALE HAD RUN </p><p>INTO OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL INTERESTS, KALLA NOTED THAT </p><p>SEVERAL OTHER IBRA-MANAGED ENTERPRISES WERE PRIMED FOR SALE, </p><p>INCLUDING BANK CENTRAL ASIA (BCA) AND INDO-TV.  THE MINISTER </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THE AMBASSADOR\'S VIEW THAT THE GOI MUST SELL AT </p><p>LEAST ONE SUCH ASSET TO BOOST INTERNATIONAL INVESTOR </p><p>CONFIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>INDONESIANS LOVE AN UNDERDOG </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) KALLA ENDED THE MEETING BY ASKING THE AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE INDONESIAN PUBLIC\'S HOSTILITY TO US-LED </p><p>MILITARY OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.  THE MINISTER CONTENDED </p><p>THAT MOST INDONESIANS DO NOT CONNECT THE US CAMPAIGN WITH THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES.  HE NOTED HE OFTEN </p><p>HAS RESPONDED TO PUBLIC QUERIES ABOUT HIS VIEWS ON "US </p><p>AGGRESSION" IN AFGHANISTAN BY COUNTERING THAT THE ISSUE IS, </p><p>MORE ACCURATELY, THE "US RESPONSE TO THE WTC ATTACK."  KALLA </p><p>ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT INDONESIAN PUBLIC\'S POSITION ON </p><p>THE ISSUE ONLY REFLECTS ITS TENDENCY TO SIDE WITH THE </p><p>UNDERDOG. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THE MINISTER ALSO USED THE DISCUSSION TO HIGHLIGHT </p><p>HIS PERSONAL PARTICIPATION IN DELIVERING GOI HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN.  KALLA NOTED HE HAD ACCOMPANIED AN </p><p>AID CONSIGNMENT VIA C-130 TO PAKISTAN ON NOVEMBER 1, AND HAD </p><p>MET WITH PRESIDENT PERVEZ MUSHARRAF.  THE PAKISTANI LEADER </p><p>HAD SAID THAT THE TALIBAN HAD SET ISLAM BACK 500 YEARS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO KALLA, WHO ADDED THAT HE SHARED MUSHARRAF\'S </p><p>OBSERVATION WITH THE INDONESIAN PUBLIC AT A SEMINAR FOLLOWING </p><p>HIS RETURN HOME. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: SOME CAUSES FOR CONCERN </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) KALLA\'S APPEAL THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE BASIS AND </p><p>LIMITED EXTENT OF INDONESIAN PUBLIC ANTIPATHY FOR THE US-LED </p><p>MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN AFGHANISTAN ECHOES A NOW-FAMILIAR </p><p>REFRAIN BY SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS, WHO ARE KEEN TO ASSURE OF US </p><p>THE GOI\'S FUNDAMENTAL SUPPORT FOR THE WAR ON TERRORISM. </p><p>HOWEVER, MANY OF KALLA\'S OTHER COMMENTS AND OMISSIONS RAISE </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF GOI POLICY.  WE NOTE THAT, </p><p>WHILE HE EXPRESSES PROFOUND CONFIDENCE THAT JAKARTA CAN </p><p>LEGISLATE AWAY SEPARATIST THREATS IN ACEH AND ELSEWHERE, </p><p>KALLA JOINS OTHER GOI OFFICIALS IN FAILING TO APPRECIATE THE </p><p>NEED TO ACCOUNT ALSO FOR TNI AND POLICE ABUSES AGAINST </p><p>CITIZENS IN THE OUTER PROVINCES.  THE MINISTER SIMILARLY </p><p>JOINED MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES IN FAILING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE </p><p>NEED TO DECISIVELY REIN IN PARAMILITARY RELIGIOUS MILITANTS </p><p>LIKE LASKAR JIHAD, WHICH ALSO POSE AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO </p><p>INDONESIA\'S STABILITY.  INDEED, KALLA\'S DEFENSIVE RESPONSE </p><p>CITING EXTERNAL CHRISTIAN INTERVENTION IN AREAS ROCKED BY </p><p>SECTARIAN VIOLENCE, WHILE DOWNPLAYING THE LASKAR JIHAD\'S </p><p>PROMINENT ROLE, SUGGESTS A SUBJECTIVE POSITION ON THE ISSUE. </p><p>THE MINISTER\'S READINESS TO TAKE SIDES IS SHOWCASED ELSEWHERE </p><p>BY HIS QUICKNESS TO BLAME THE (MADURESE) VICTIMS OF COMMUNAL </p><p>VIOLENCE IN KALIMANTAN. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  SIMILARLY, NOTHING ABOUT KALLA\'S </p><p>APPROACH TO POVERTY ALLEVIATION STRIKES US AS HOPEFUL. </p><p>INDONESIA NEEDS NEW INVESTMENT TO CREATE JOBS.  PEOPLE WITH </p><p>JOBS CAN CLIMB OUT OF POVERTY.  THE REASON THAT THE </p><p>GROWTH-LED DEVELOPMENT BENEFITED THE ELITE IN THE PAST WAS </p><p>DUE TO GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED POLICIES.  SOEHARTO FREQUENTLY </p><p>SPOKE OF THE NEED TO SUPPORT COOPERATIVES AND SMALL AND </p><p>MEDIUM BUSINESS.  KALLA\'S ATTEMPTS TO DIRECT FUNDS TO THE </p><p>SAME ENDS ARE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>BOYCE </p><p></p></div>
