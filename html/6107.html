<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001392 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR/SE AND EB/IFD </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 4 COB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1351 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Markets were relieved this afternoon that </p><p>today\'s Treasury auctions had gone relatively well, with the </p><p>lira and equities gaining for the day (though t-bill yields </p><p>closed up 2.5 percentage points).  Treasury raised a total of </p><p>TL 2.3 quadrillion that, together with some of Tresaury\'s </p><p>cash reserves of TL 4.2 quadrillion, will be used to meet the </p><p>March 5 debt redemption of TL 3.9 quadrillion.  Looking ahead </p><p>towards the March 19 redemption of TL 5.2 quadrillion to the </p><p>domestic market, Treasury plans to schedule several auctions, </p><p>including possibly an F/X-linked auction next week.  IMF </p><p>resrep briefed us on the status of the Fourth Review.  He </p><p>agrees in general with MinState Babacan\'s prognosis that the </p><p>Fourth Review could be held early April, but IMF is concerned </p><p>with possible delays stemming from formation of an Erdogan </p><p>govenrment. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Improve Slightly On </p><p>Treasury Auction Results </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Afternoon trading today reflected market relief that </p><p>the two Treasury auctions earlier in the day had raised over </p><p>TL 2 quadrillion, sufficient to enable Treasury to meet the </p><p>March 5 TL 3.9 quadrillion debt redemption.  The lira firmed </p><p>nearly one percent from yesterday (closing at TL 1,637,000 to </p><p>the dollar), and the Istanbul Stock Exchange rose 4.8 percent </p><p>on the day.  Yields on T-bills remained at the 62.5 percent </p><p>level of the auction, reflecting overall investor concerns on </p><p>GOT financing prospects.  (Note:  Today\'s yields are some 16 </p><p>percentage points above the GOT\'s targeted average interest </p><p>rate for the year.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Treasury\'s Deputy DG for public finance Volkan </p><p>Taskin was relieved after the March 4 auctions, telling us </p><p>"every auction is a new experience."  He added that, in </p><p>addition to the TL 2 quadrillion raised from the market, the </p><p>Treasury sold about TL 300 trillion to public institutions </p><p>(primarily the unemployment insurance fund) before the </p><p>auction.  This brings the total amount raised to TL 2.3 </p><p>quadrillion.  Looking ahead to the March 19 redemption of TL </p><p>5.2 quadrillion ($3 billion), Taskin said Treasury would </p><p>schedule several auctions, including probably a F/X-linked </p><p>auction next week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Status of IMF Fourth Review </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On March 4, IMF resrep gave us the following status </p><p>report on the IMF Fourth Review: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Timing:  State Minister Babacan told the press March 4 he </p><p>expected an IMF Board review in late March or early April, </p><p>followed by disbursement of the entire $1.6 billion tranche. </p><p>Resrep didn\'t disagree with Babacan\'s timing.  In principle, </p><p>the IMF staff could wrap up LOI discussions this week, and </p><p>take back to headquarters ad ref agreement on it.  But IMF </p><p>staff have questions regarding the March 9 parliamentary </p><p>by-elections.  Assuming Erdogan becomes Prime Minister, would </p><p>the Gul government\'s ad ref agreement on the LOI bind an </p><p>Erdogan government?  IMF staff project that an Erdogan </p><p>government would take about 3 weeks to form, thus potentially </p><p>slowing down the LOI and Fourth Review process (though there </p><p>are no pending conditions requiring parliamentary action, </p><p>other than passage of the 2003 budget, in the Fourth Review.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Budget and World Bank Problem:  IMF staff are confident </p><p>that the budget now delivers a 6.5 percent primary surplus, </p><p>but there are two budget problems: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>First, World Bank staff object to the draft budget\'s delay of </p><p>TL 1.4 quadrillion (nearly $1 billion) in "Direct Income </p><p>Support" to farmers, a key ag sector reform.  A one-year </p><p>delay of this program means farmers cannot rely on this new </p><p>program, meaning they will instead lobby for traditional </p><p>support, such as further restructuring Ziraat Bank loans. </p><p>Per WB Staff, World Bank country director Chhibber told </p><p>Babacan March 3 this budget measure would make it impossible </p><p>for the World Bank to disburse its existing budget support </p><p>loan programs (a total of $1.375 billion in loan tranches, </p><p>which are due to expire at end March 2003).  This would leave </p><p>the World Bank limited to existing project financing (also </p><p>affected by 2003 budget cuts to public investment projects.) </p><p>Babacan said he would get back to Chhibber, per World Bank </p><p>staff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Second, the IMF staff see a financing gap in the 2003 budget, </p><p>and they would need to explain to the IMF board how this gap </p><p>will be filled (in addition to their lending) before taking </p><p>the Fourth Review to the Board.  Resrep said the size of the </p><p>gap was still being studied. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Key structural reforms.  The direct tax reform bill </p><p>appears to be on track:  it has been prepared, IMF staff have </p><p>commented on the draft and it could in theory be submitted to </p><p>parliament (the Foruth Review condition) soon. The TEKEL </p><p>privatization plan should be passed soon by the Higher </p><p>Privatization Council (another condition).  Two other </p><p>conditions require work:  there is no clarity in reducing </p><p>redundancies in the state enterprise staffing, with a GOT </p><p>proposal (to offer early retirement) unacceptable because it </p><p>fails to target actual redundancies.  To remedy deficiencies </p><p>in banking sector reform (especially the BRSA\'s agreement on </p><p>Pamuk/Yapi Kredi connected lending rescheduling), the new LOI </p><p>will require new legislation to strenghten BRSA\'s hand by </p><p>limiting the time for legal appeals to its decisions, and by </p><p>a new bankruptcy law which will improve the value of the </p><p>BRSA\'s non-performing loan assets, and lead to sales of these </p><p>assets. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
