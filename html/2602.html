<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000515 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS TO USAID -DCHA/OFDA -RAY DIONNE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR RIEGEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: HUMANITARIAN COSTS OF MAOIST INSURGENCY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  KATHMANDU 0450 </p><p> </p><p>1. Since early 1996, Maoist insurgents have been waging </p><p>an increasingly bloody "People\'s War" aimed at toppling </p><p>the constitutional monarchy and democratically elected </p><p>government of Nepal.  Although initially centered in </p><p>impoverished, underdeveloped districts of the west and </p><p>mid-west regions, the insurgents have successfully </p><p>spread their violent campaign to affect all of Nepal\'s </p><p>75 districts, including those long considered "safe" </p><p>from Maoist influence. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Besides attacking members of the security forces, </p><p>the Maoists have traditionally also targeted local </p><p>government officials, teachers, mainstream party </p><p>activists, and other perceived representatives of </p><p>central government authority living and working in the </p><p>remote, rural areas where insurgent activity and </p><p>influence have typically been heaviest.  In addition, </p><p>the insurgents impress children into service as porters, </p><p>cooks, and sometimes as armed cadre.  In some cases, </p><p>girls so conscripted have been sexually assaulted by </p><p>Maoist cadre (Reftel) and are unwilling or unable to </p><p>return home.  Maoist threats, extortion, arson, </p><p>abductions, beatings, torture, and murder have long </p><p>spread terror through such communities, creating untold- </p><p>-and undocumented--numbers of displaced persons unable </p><p>to return to their homes.  Countermeasures by the </p><p>security forces have also contributed to the involuntary </p><p>movement of people. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Since halting negotiations with Prime Minister Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba and unilaterally breaking a four-month </p><p>ceasefire November 23, however, the Maoists have sharply </p><p>increased both the frequency and the intensity of such </p><p>attacks against military, police, and civilian targets. </p><p>The Human Rights Report for 2001 documents the </p><p>increasing number of incidents and their victims. </p><p>Every day, Tribhuvan University Hospital in Kathmandu </p><p>admits an average of two victims of Maoist violence from </p><p>across the country; an unknown number of others are </p><p>treated in smaller district hospitals.  Many of the </p><p>victims suffer from shattered limbs, multiple stab </p><p>wounds, and even amputations.  Of the more than 3,000 </p><p>people killed by both sides in the insurgency over the </p><p>past six years, over half have been killed in just the </p><p>three months since the ceasefire was broken. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The families of those killed, injured, or otherwise </p><p>intimidated often flee their homes in fear, leaving </p><p>behind their property and businesses, to seek the </p><p>comparative safety of the district headquarters, the </p><p>capital, or the homes of relatives in other areas. In </p><p>the face of severe budgetary constraints, the Government </p><p>of Nepal (GON) makes no provision for such individuals, </p><p>who must depend on relatives or the limited number of </p><p>charitable institutions active in Nepal for assistance. </p><p>No GON office--including the Disaster Management unit in </p><p>the Home Ministry--has set up a central system to </p><p>register such cases or to maintain data on the number of </p><p>such internally displaced persons, but anecdotal </p><p>evidence suggests a conservative estimate could reach </p><p>well over the thousands. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Embassy\'s own quick survey of conditions in </p><p>selected districts revealed the following.  The Chief </p><p>District Officer (CDO) in Baglung knows of 70 families </p><p>who have left their homes and are now staying at </p><p>district headquarters; the CDO in Salyan knows of 100; </p><p>while in Surkhet there are 128 known cases.  The local </p><p>chapter of the Red Cross in Rukum, meanwhile, counts 90 </p><p>displaced families.  The CDO in Lalitpur in Kathmandu </p><p>Valley (where many displaced persons seeking refuge in </p><p>the capital turn up) says about 80 people from across </p><p>the country have registered with his office.  Since </p><p>civil servants often live above their offices in the </p><p>districts, a number of families were made homeless when </p><p>the insurgents burned down government buildings and some </p><p>private homes in the Feb. 17 attack in Achham District. </p><p>The Nepal Maoist Victim Association, a charity </p><p>affiliated with the Nepali Congress Party, meanwhile, </p><p>has documented 452 killings and 916 injuries  of </p><p>civilians by Maoists.  At least 1,000 individuals have </p><p>sought the Association\'s support over the past few </p><p>years.  The Embassy was unable to verify statistics in </p><p>another 12 heavily affected districts, where telephone </p><p>service has been cut by Maoist attacks on repeater </p><p>stations. </p><p> </p><p>6.  T.R. Onta, Executive Director of the Nepal Red Cross </p><p>Society, says his organization has provided assistance </p><p>to some of the victims of Maoist-related violence, </p><p>including to 300 families in Achham.  He would like to </p><p>do more to help the displaced, but is constrained by a </p><p>lack of resources, as well as by the lack of information </p><p>from the GON.  Onta has asked the local Nepal Red Cross </p><p>chapters, which operate in all 75 districts, to carry </p><p>out an assessment of the number of displaced and their </p><p>needs so that the Society can better plan its efforts to </p><p>respond.  While generally responsive and proactive in </p><p>the event of natural disasters, the Home Ministry does </p><p>not recognize the chronic displacement of average </p><p>Nepalis from their homes as a disaster and has therefore </p><p>not responded. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment:  Spectacular Maoist assaults like the </p><p>attack on Achham receive wide press coverage here, and </p><p>the GON has publicly appealed for aid to rebuild the </p><p>demolished district headquarters.  But little is being </p><p>done to address the quieter, more pervasive everyday </p><p>tragedy of individual families being forced from their </p><p>homes because their government can no longer guarantee </p><p>their safety.  Families fleeing violence lose their </p><p>livelihoods, their property, and, often, the chance to </p><p>educate their children.  Other casualties of the </p><p>conflict, like children recruited--and, in some cases, </p><p>sexually abused--by the Maoists also suffer </p><p>displacement.  Civilian survivors of violence cannot </p><p>count on GON support to cover medical costs, many of </p><p>which include long-term hospital stays.  The number of </p><p>these victims is likely to continue to climb as security </p><p>forces expand cordon and search operations  and as the </p><p>Maoists, under pressure from security forces on the more </p><p>conventional battlefield, resort to increased terror and </p><p>intimidation among helpless civilian populations.  The </p><p>GON is clearly not equipped to address the mounting </p><p>needs of these victims and must work with the donor </p><p>community to take immediate action to stem this </p><p>humanitarian crisis. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
