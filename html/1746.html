<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 003121 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR: EUR/WE (VAN CLEVE) </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 85/001 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 06/07/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IR, VT, religious freedom </p><p>SUBJECT: BACKGROUND PAPER FOR PRESIDENTIAL VISIT: IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA JOSEPH MERANTE, REASONS E.O. 12958 </p><p>1.5 (B), (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) BEGIN TEXT.  THE VATICAN CONDEMNED THE WEST\'S </p><p>PROSECUTION OF THE GULF WAR, AND IT HAS CONSISTENTLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03121  111605Z </p><p>OPPOSED U.S. SANCTIONS POLICY TOWARD IRAQ.  WE SHOULD </p><p>EXPECT IT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO.  MANY FACTORS ARE </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE VATICAN\'S TOLERATION OF THE IRAQI </p><p>REGIME.  THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES/HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS: THE </p><p>VATICAN SEEKS TO TRANSLATE ITS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, AS </p><p>WELL AS ITS SINCERE HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS, INTO </p><p>CONCRETE POLICY. ITS NON-CONFRONTATIONAL POLICY TOWARD </p><p>IRAQ IS PARTIALLY BASED ON ITS CONVICTION THAT THE </p><p>ECONOMIC EMBARGO IS SEVERELY IMPACTING THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>IRAQ.  TO COUNTER THIS BELIEF, CREDIBLE ARGUMENTS MUST </p><p>BE MADE THAT THE EMBARGO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>HARDSHIP BEING EXPERIENCED BY THE IRAQI PEOPLE; </p><p> </p><p>-- NATIONAL SELF-INTEREST: THE VATICAN LABORS TO </p><p>PROTECT CATHOLICS AROUND THE WORLD.  ITS CONSISTENT </p><p>SUPPORT OF SADDAM HUSSEIN PARTIALLY RESULTS FROM ITS </p><p>DESIRE TO PROTECT THE 600,000 IRAQI CATHOLICS FROM </p><p>ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM.  THE VATICAN HAS CONSISTENTLY </p><p>TOLD US THAT, IN ITS VIEW, THE STATE OF RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM IN IRAQ IS BETTER THAN IN MANY OTHER ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES.  IN THE VATICAN\'S VIEW, THE LIKELY </p><p>ALTERNATIVE TO SADDAM WOULD BE AN ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT. </p><p>FOR THE VATICAN, A SECULAR DICTATORSHIP IS MUCH </p><p>PREFERABLE TO AN ISLAMIC ONE. (NOTE: 600,00 IRAQI\'S </p><p>BELONG TO THE CHALDEAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.  THIS CHURCH </p><p>IS IN FULL COMMUNION WITH ROME, ALTHOUGH IT RETAINS </p><p>RITES, TRADITIONS, AND DISCIPLINE WHICH ARE </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ROMAN CATHOLICISM). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03121  111605Z </p><p>--RELIGIOUS MANEUVERING: THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IS </p><p>CLOSE TO SIGNING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH </p><p>OF THE EAST ON REUNIFICATION WITH ROME.  (NOTE: THE </p><p>ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST IS AN ANCIENT CHURCH WHICH </p><p>BROKE WITH THE REST OF WORLD CHRISTENDOM IN THE 4TH </p><p>CENTURY).  THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST IS CENTERED </p><p>IN IRAQ, AND AS A CHRISTIAN DENOMINATION PREFERS </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN TO AN ISLAMICIST LEADER.  THE VATICAN </p><p>IS VERY SENSITIVE AT THIS POINT TO AVOID TAKING </p><p>POSITIONS WHICH WOULD ALIENATE THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH. </p><p> </p><p>-- PERSONAL DESIRES OF JOHN PAUL II: THERE ARE THREE </p><p>MAJOR TRIPS WHICH THE POPE HAS EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO </p><p>COMPLETE BEFORE HIS HEALTH FURTHER DETERIORATES-- </p><p>RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAQ.  PLANS FOR THE POPE TO VISIT THE </p><p>SITE OF ABRAHAM\'S BIRTH IN UR (IRAQ) WERE CALLED OFF </p><p>IN 2000.  THE POPE STILL HARBORS A DESIRE TO PRAY AT </p><p>THIS SITE.  THIS PAPAL DESIRE IS ANOTHER REASON WHY </p><p>THE VATICAN WISHES TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH </p><p>IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  CONCLUSION:  UNLESS SADDAM\'S HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ABUSES INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY, AND DIRECTLY IMPACT THE </p><p>IRAQI CATHOLIC COMMUNITY, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE </p><p>VATICAN WILL CHANGE ITS POSITION ON IRAQ.  IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO BRIEF THE VATICAN ON </p><p>CONTINUED IRAQI ABUSES, AND TO PROVIDE CREDIBLE </p><p>EVIDENCE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S MALEVOLENT INTENT AGAINST </p><p>NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. </p><p>MERANTE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03121  111605Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA03121 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
