<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002985 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/PD MSPEER, EAP/BCLTV, EAP/PA </p><p>HO CHI MINH CITY FOR PAO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PROP, OIIP, VM, CWG-PD, CTERR </p><p>SUBJECT: PAO DISCUSSES COVERAGE OF ANTI-TERROR CAMPAIGN WITH SENIOR COMMUNIST PARTY PRESS OFFICIAL </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HANOI 2834 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE HANOI PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER PAID A VISIT NOVEMBER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02985  01 OF 02  150919Z </p><p>14 TO COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS TO DISCUSS WITH DR. VU </p><p>DUY THONG, DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JOURNALISM AND </p><p>PUBLISHING OF THE CENTRAL COMMISSION FOR IDEOLOGY AND </p><p>CULTURE, THE VIETNAMESE MEDIA\'S HANDLING OF POST-SEPTEMBER </p><p>11 EVENTS.  ALSO PRESENT WERE MR. QUE LIEM, VICE DIRECTOR OF </p><p>NEWSPAPER PUBLICATION, MS. MAI Y VAN, SPECIALIST, AND MS. </p><p>NGUYEN THI QUYEN, SPECIALIST.  THE TONE OF THE ONE-HOUR </p><p>MEETING WAS CORDIAL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE PAO SAID THAT THE U.S. APPRECIATED ACTIONS TAKEN BY </p><p>VIETNAM IN SUPPORT OF THE ANTI-TERROR CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING </p><p>ENHANCEMENT OF EMBASSY SECURITY, NAME CHECKS AT IMMIGRATION </p><p>CHECKPOINTS, AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BANKS TO SEARCH FOR ASSETS </p><p>BELONGING TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE </p><p>U.S. IS CONCERNED THAT MEDIA COVERAGE IN VIETNAM, WHILE </p><p>DRAWING ON WESTERN WIRE SERVICE AND TELEVISION REPORTS, HAS </p><p>TENDED SELECTIVELY TO OVERPLAY STORIES OF CIVILIAN </p><p>CASUALTIES BASED ON TALIBAN CLAIMS, AND HAS GIVEN A </p><p>MISLEADING IMPRESSION, ESPECIALLY IN HEADLINES, THAT SMALL </p><p>PROTEST DEMONSTRATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES AGAINST COALITION </p><p>MILITARY ACTION REPRESENT A MAJORITY OPINION ("WORLD REJECTS </p><p>MILITARY CAMPAIGN").  THE PAO ASKED THAT THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>MEDIA TAKE MORE CARE TO PRESENT A BALANCED PICTURE AND TO </p><p>CREDIT THE U.S. AND ITS PARTNERS WITH SEEKING TO AVOID </p><p>CIVILIAN CASUALTIES WHENEVER POSSIBLE, IN CONTRAST WITH OUR </p><p>AL-QAEDA FOES, WHO DELIBERATELY TARGET CIVILIANS, AND THEIR </p><p>TALIBAN PROTECTORS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DR. THONG STATED THAT UNDER THE VIETNAMESE PRESS LAW, </p><p>THE MEDIA ARE UNDER STATE MANAGEMENT BUT "FREE"; EACH EDITOR- </p><p>IN-CHIEF MAY DECIDE WHAT TO COVER AND HOW, BUT IS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02985  01 OF 02  150919Z </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR OBSERVING THE LAW.  HAVING NO CORRESPONDENT </p><p>IN REMOTE AND UNFAMILIAR AFGHANISTAN, THE VIETNAMESE MEDIA </p><p>RELY LARGELY ON WESTERN WIRE SERVICES, CNN, AND OTHER </p><p>FOREIGN NEWS SOURCES FOR THEIR REPORTING.  THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>VALUE HUMAN LIFE HIGHLY, AND HAVE SUFFERED MUCH IN PAST </p><p>WARS, HE NOTED.  THEY ARE COMMITTED TO FIGHTING TERRORISM, </p><p>BUT WANT TO DO SO WITHOUT CAUSING HARM TO INNOCENT LIVES OR </p><p>HUNGER AMONG THE POPULATION.  VIETNAM TOO IS A VICTIM OF </p><p>TERRORISM, HE SAID, REFERRING TO RECENT INCIDENTS OF BOMBS </p><p>PLANTED BY EXPATRIATE VIETNAMESE AT VIETNAMESE EMBASSIES IN </p><p>SOUTHEAST ASIA (WHICH CAUSED NO CASUALTIES).  HE CALLED FOR </p><p>GREATER INFORMATION EXCHANGE TO COUNTERACT THE NEGATIVE </p><p>PICTURE OF VIETNAM PAINTED IN THE WEST BY EMBITTERED EXILES </p><p>AND A FEW JOURNALISTS.  HE OBSERVED THAT PAS HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY WAS "PERMITTED" THAT MORNING TO HOLD A DIGITAL VIDEO </p><p>CONFERENCE WITH A U.S. EXPERT ON TERRORISM FOR LOCAL </p><p>EDITORS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE PAO RESPONDED THAT THE WAR ON TERRORISM DID NOT </p><p>BEGIN ON SEPTEMBER 11, BUT DATES BACK AT LEAST TO THE FIRST </p><p>WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING OF 1993; ALSO, OSAMA BIN LADEN </p><p>AND HIS ACCOMPLICES WERE UNDER INDICTMENT FOR THE TWO </p><p>EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN EAST AFRICA.  THE U.S. HAD TRIED BY NON- </p><p>MILITARY MEANS SINCE LONG BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11 TO PERSUADE </p><p>THE TALIBAN TO HAND OVER BIN LADEN TO FACE JUSTICE.  WHEN AL- </p><p>QAEDA, WHICH WE KNOW HAS BEEN SEEKING WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>DESTRUCTION, PERPETRATED ITS BRUTAL SEPTEMBER ATTACK ON THE </p><p>U.S., THE WORLD HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FIGHT BACK AND DEFEAT </p><p>THIS THREAT, OR FACE THE IMMINENT POSSIBILITY OF EVEN WORSE </p><p>ATROCITIES.  WITH DR. THONG\'S INFLUENTIAL ROLE REGARDING THE </p><p>MEDIA, THE PAO HOPED THAT HE WOULD ENCOURAGE EDITORS TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02985  01 OF 02  150919Z </p><p>CONSIDER THE WHOLE PICTURE AND BALANCE THEIR COVERAGE AND </p><p>COMMENTARY FAIRLY.  FOR EXAMPLE, THEY SHOULD NOT </p><p>UNCRITICALLY ACCEPT TALIBAN CASUALTY CLAIMS AND SHOULD </p><p>CLEARLY REPORT THE EMPHATICALLY REPEATED U.S. POLICY NOT TO </p><p>TARGET CIVILIANS.  AS FOR HUNGER IN AFGHANISTAN, THE U.S. </p><p>HAS DONE AND CONTINUES TO DO MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY TO </p><p>FEED THE AFGHAN PEOPLE.  REGARDING VIETNAM\'S CLAIM TO BE A </p><p>VICTIM OF TERRORISM, THE PAO SAID HE WAS GLAD THAT U.S. LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WERE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ARREST </p><p>IN SOUTHEAST ASIA OF SUSPECTS IN THE RECENT INCIDENTS, AND </p><p>TO ARREST ONE OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE PAO DEPARTED AFTER OFFERING TO SEND ALL FOUR PARTY </p><p>OFFICIALS OUR LATEST INFORMATION IN VIETNAMESE ON THE ANTI- </p><p>TERRORISM CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  IN THE WORLD OF VIETNAM\'S IDEOLOGICALLY </p><p>CONTROLLED MEDIA, DR. THONG, HIS STAFF, AND HIS SUPERIORS </p><p>ARE THE ULTIMATE GATEKEEPERS.  WHEN HE TALKS, EDITORS </p><p>LISTEN.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER HE WILL ELECT TO </p><p>STEER THEM TO A LESS SKEPTICAL VIEW OF THE ANTI-TERRORISM </p><p>CAMPAIGN AND THE U.S. ROLE IN IT.  AN APPARENT SHIFT IN THE </p><p>LAST DAY OR TWO AWAY FROM SOME OF THE HARSHER TONES IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S MEDIA COVERAGE MIGHT OWE SOMETHING TO THE DESIRE </p><p>TO AVOID SIDING WITH A LOSER AFTER THE PRECIPITOUS MILITARY </p><p>COLLAPSE OF THE TALIBAN.   END COMMENT. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02985  02 OF 02  150920Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  BIOGRAPHIC NOTE:  DR. THONG, WHO APPEARS TO BE ABOUT </p><p>FIFTY YEARS OLD, SAID THAT HE HAD STUDIED IN RUSSIA FOR </p><p>THREE YEARS, BUT DID NOT RESPOND IN KIND WHEN ADDRESSED IN </p><p>RUSSIAN.  HE SAID HE ALSO SPENT SEVERAL YEARS IN CHINA.  HE </p><p>SPEAKS LITTLE ENGLISH. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
