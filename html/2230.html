<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002984 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, SF, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LOCAL MEDIA REPORTS - NIGERIA AND SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA TO SIGN MILTARY PACT </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Press reporting from "The Guardian" newspaper </p><p>on November 21, repeated in para 2, indicates that Nigeria </p><p>and South Africa will sign a military pact.  The pact </p><p>apparently will focus on naval cooperation, primarily </p><p>training, maintenance and joint exercises, and joint patrol </p><p>of the South Atlantic.  It is somewhat ironic that Nigerian </p><p>Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Samuel Afolayan, used a </p><p>comparison with South Africa\'s smaller navy to argue for </p><p>additional resources for Nigeria\'s navy, which is seriously </p><p>overstaffed but has no operational, ocean-going vessels.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Begin article text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Nigeria, South Africa to sign military pact" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NIGERIA and South Africa will soon sign a military pact that </p><p>will streamline the areas of co-operation between their armed </p><p>forces.  The Chief of Defense Staff, Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi </p><p>who disclosed this when the Chief of South African Navy, Vice </p><p>Admiral John Relief visited him in Abuja, said   some aspects </p><p>of the program were being implemented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Already, a Nigerian Lieutenant Colonel is a member of the </p><p>Directing Staff at the South African Command and Staff </p><p>College.  Also, Nigeria is to start the exchange of cadets </p><p>with the South African Defense Academy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Vice Admiral Relief in explaining the scope of the </p><p>relationship between the two countries stated that "what is </p><p>important is that between Nigeria and South Africa, we have </p><p>the best Navies in Africa.  The first level of co-operation </p><p>is in the area of training. Second is the repairing of </p><p>warships and the conduct of joint exercises between both </p><p>countries.  We both support the new African Initiative and </p><p>Millennium plan.  We have ability to build relations </p><p>together." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Both Nigeria and South Africa, according to Relief, are </p><p>desirous of providing security in the South Atlantic. </p><p>According to him: "The South Atlantic is a very important sea </p><p>route to South Africa.  We share the coast with Namibia and </p><p>Angola.  It is being mined for diamonds and natural gas. </p><p>There are lots of natural resources that will tempt people </p><p>there.  A strong Navy will guarantee the safety of the areas. </p><p> Currently, there is no threat, but that doesn\'t mean that in </p><p>the unsure world we are, things might not change." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Chief of Naval Staff, Vice-Admiral Samuel Afolayan who in </p><p>October visited South Africa, said the international </p><p>community attached great importance to the security of the </p><p>South Atlantic and the co-operation between Nigeria and South </p><p>African Navies.  Said he: "It is a good expectation that </p><p>after my visit to South Africa, I followed it up with a visit </p><p>to the United States and the safety of the South Atlantic was </p><p>what we discussed.  They were delighted that we are concerned </p><p>with the geo-political consideration of the zone. They are </p><p>eager to note and see such developments going   on in the </p><p>African continent." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Afolayan advocated increased funding and re-equipping of the </p><p>Nigerian Navy to meet up with the challenges of the new </p><p>democracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He stated: "With the South African Navy that is small, </p><p>compact and efficient, we see the need for the Nigerian Navy </p><p>to be better equipped than what it is now.  They have </p><p>capabilities yet to be possessed by the Nigerian Navy.  We </p><p>will get those capabilities if we are re-equipped." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The South African Navy has about 5,500 uniformed personnel </p><p>and 2000 civilians. It has two naval bases, a dockyard, nine </p><p>combat craft, three sub-marines, six minesweepers and four </p><p>corvettes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: Bilateral military cooperation between </p><p>Nigeria and South Africa is likely to be beneficial to </p><p>Nigeria, and to U.S. goals for Nigeria\'s military.  At times, </p><p>African states accept notions of military reform more readily </p><p>from another African State rather than the West.  It is </p><p>somewhat ironic (but unfortunately normal), however, that </p><p>Nigerian Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Samuel Afolayan, </p><p>used the South African visit as an opportunity to argue for </p><p>additional resources for Nigeria\'s Navy, rather than using </p><p>the visit as an opportunity to advocate for a more </p><p>streamlined Service.  The Naval Service is top-heavy and </p><p>personnel-laden (19 Admirals and 34 Commodores and less than </p><p>10,000 men) but has no operational ocean-going vessels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Nigerian Navy tends to think big, voicing a need </p><p>for submarines and aircraft carriers to the DATT.  However, </p><p>its capabilities are small.  A Nigerian Navy without </p><p>fundamental defense reform is not likely to achieve anything </p><p>beyond coastal patrol, and that achievement is likely only </p><p>because the U.S. is providing the wherewithal (Balsam-class </p><p>180\' patrol vessels).  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
