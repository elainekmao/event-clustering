The allocation includes an additional C$15 </p><p>million to support the operational budget of the Afghan </p><p>Transitional Authority through the World Bank\'s Afghanistan </p><p>Reconstruction Trust Fund, plus about C$6 million for </p><p>security and reconstruction.  The exchange rate is about </p><p>C$1/US$0.72.  End summary </p><p> </p><p>Total pledged </p><p>------------- </p><p>2.  At the Brussels conference in March, 2003, the GOC </p><p>pledged $250 million over the next two calendar years for </p><p>rural development, natural resources management, security and </p><p>the rule of law, as well as budget support for TISA (Ref A). </p><p>The just-announced C$15 million in operational support </p><p>through the ARTF for the current year is in addition to the </p><p>C$23.5 million anounced in Brussels.  Counting the C$19 </p><p>million provided last year, Canada has contributed C$57.5 </p><p>million to TISA\'s operating budget. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The GOC also announced allocations of C$5 million to the </p><p>UN Mine Action Program for Afghanistan, and C$1.2 million to </p><p>support civil-military cooperation projects. </p><p> </p><p>Plans for FY04 aid </p><p>------------------ </p><p>4.  CIDA staff evaluate project proposals on an ongoing </p><p>basis, using priorities identified in consultations with TISA </p><p>officials and other donors.  Minister Whelan periodically </p><p>approves proposals for overall allocation of funds, and in </p><p>the case of Afghanistan, later approves each individual </p><p>project.  We expect future commitments to address the </p><p>priorities in paragraph 2. </p><p> </p><p>Total amount delivered </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>5.  Between September 2001 and March 2003,  Canada disbursed </p><p>C$116.6 million in aid to Afghanistan, including the C$19 </p><p>million in budget support for TISA mentioned above.  Other </p><p>previously-reported amounts include C$1.5 million for </p><p>electoral support through Elections Canada and the </p><p>International Foundation for Election Systems; C$3.5 million </p><p>to the UN to support reform of the judicial system; and C$0.5 </p><p>million to Justice Canada to assist TISA (Ref D). </p><p> </p><p>This message responds to the reporting requirements of the </p><p>Afghanistan Freedom Support Act (Ref E). </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
