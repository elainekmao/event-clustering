<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002554 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE FROM AMBASSADOR GNEHM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, PGOV, KPAL, SY, LE, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: UNRWA AND U.S. INTERESTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is a joint message from Embassies Amman, Beirut </p><p>and Damascus. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Given current scrutiny in the Israeli press and in </p><p>Congress of UNRWA\'s programs and role in the West Bank, it is </p><p>important to remember that UNRWA plays a key role throughout </p><p>the region -- Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza </p><p>-- in maintaining a basic standard of living (and hence </p><p>political stability) among an extremely politicized </p><p>Palestinian refugee population.  It is the largest provider </p><p>of services to Palestinian refugees -- services that local </p><p>governments would have a hard time funding in UNRWA\'s absence </p><p>and, in the case of Lebanon, would refuse in fear that such </p><p>steps would lead to the refugees\' permanent resettlement. </p><p>With 22,000 mostly Palestinian staff, UNRWA also is a </p><p>significant employer of a population whose unemployment rate </p><p>is universally higher than that of the local populace.  (The </p><p>unemployment rate for Palestinians in Lebanon, for example, </p><p>is estimated at 60 percent.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Perhaps most important, UNRWA is one of the few </p><p>organizations able to instill Western-based values -- a </p><p>critical counterweight in an increasingly marginalized </p><p>population that could easily be politically activated in the </p><p>event of further regional tensions.  It also provides a </p><p>secular alternative to the Islamic charitable organizations </p><p>working in the camps, many of which promote unhelpful </p><p>political agendas and have links to suspect organizations. </p><p>Continued, strong USG support for UNRWA is essential to our </p><p>strategic interests in the region.  Here are just a few </p><p>examples of UNRWA\'s relevance outside the West Bank and Gaza, </p><p>in places that normally do not make the news. </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Jordan has more registered Palestinian refugees </p><p>than the West Bank and Gaza combined (1.6 million in Jordan, </p><p>1.4 million in the West Bank and Gaza).  With an annual </p><p>budget in Jordan of USD 71 million, UNRWA provides services </p><p>to this poor, politically active population that the </p><p>Government of Jordan could not support without major new </p><p>international assistance.  UNRWA is the secular, apolitical </p><p>alternative to Islamic charitable organizations -- some with </p><p>a political agenda.  As UNRWA\'s largest donor, the U.S. has </p><p>significant influence over UNRWA programs and policies, where </p><p>it would have none with alternative organizations. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) GOJ officials have told us that any reduction in US </p><p>support for UNRWA would have devastating operational and </p><p>political ramifications in Jordan.  With the U.S. providing </p><p>at least 25 percent of UNRWA\'s annual operating budget, any </p><p>reduction in U.S. funding would force UNRWA to cut its </p><p>services significantly.  A reduction in U.S. funding for </p><p>UNRWA also would be a blow to peace in the region, as UNRWA </p><p>always has been viewed as a symbol of hope that the </p><p>Palestinians have not been forgotten.  Palestinian refugees </p><p>in Jordan would interpret funding cuts as a sign that UNRWA </p><p>was being phased out and their internationally recognized </p><p>claims eliminated without a political settlement.  We agree </p><p>with Jordanian officials who believe that this would be yet </p><p>another challenge to the long-term stability of the Kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>LEBANON </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) UNRWA records indicate that 375,000 registered </p><p>Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon, yet most UNRWA </p><p>officials agree that the number is closer to 200,000.  (Given </p><p>the difficult conditions in Lebanon, most refugees who have </p><p>been able to leave have left.)  The 200,000 refugees in </p><p>Lebanon constitute the neediest of UNRWA\'s lot, excluded by </p><p>Lebanese law from working in 72 different professions, owning </p><p>property or even improving the infrastructure in the camps. </p><p>With neither national ID\'s nor significant income, the </p><p>Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are far more dependent on </p><p>UNRWA services than those in any other area.  UNRWA\'s USD 48 </p><p>million annual budget in Lebanon covers health and education </p><p>services that are not provided in other UNRWA fields, such as </p><p>extended hospitalization payments and secondary education. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Given Lebanon\'s fragile political balance, </p><p>stability among the historically activist Palestinian refugee </p><p>community is essential.  UNRWA is the largest provider of </p><p>services to Palestinian refugees, and one of the few truly </p><p>apolitical organizations working in the camps. </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) With an annual operating budget of USD 26 million, </p><p>UNRWA\'s Syria Field provides education, health and relief </p><p>services to the 400,000 Palestinian refugees resident in </p><p>Syria.  As in Jordan, UNRWA\'s innovative social programs </p><p>allow the U.S., as a major UNRWA donor, to shape programs and </p><p>policies. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Thanks to UNRWA, Syria is playing the unexpected role </p><p>of incubator for the potential resettlement of Palestinian </p><p>refugees within Arab countries.  With significant support </p><p>from the USG, UNRWA\'s Syria field has developed plans to </p><p>resettle 300 refugee families from overcrowded World War II </p><p>barracks to a newly developed camp.  With backing from the </p><p>European Commission, UNRWA and the SARG also are building </p><p>massive new water and sewerage links from its rural refugee </p><p>camps to neighboring Syrian towns.  While insisting that its </p><p>own significant political and financial support for these </p><p>projects in no way diminishes the refugees\' right of return, </p><p>the Syrian Government is in fact quietly laying the </p><p>groundwork for smooth absorption of Palestinian refugees into </p><p>Syrian society, should a political settlement be reached.  It </p><p>serves U.S. interests to encourage this unannounced SARG </p><p>policy by continuing our support for UNRWA\'s operations in </p><p>Syria. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Our cooperation with UNRWA also puts us in touch </p><p>with the Syrian agency in charge of Palestinian refugees, </p><p>GAPAR.  Embassy Damascus and Amman-based refcoord have very </p><p>good relations with GAPAR.  Like anti-narcotics and culture, </p><p>assistance to Palestinian refugees is one of the areas where </p><p>we have a cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship with </p><p>the SARG, despite the tensions in the overall bilateral </p><p>relationship. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
