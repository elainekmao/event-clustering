ANKARA 2616 </p><p>     B. STATE 101170 </p><p>     C. KUWAIT 1547 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Francis </p><p>Ward for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) This cable contains action requests for the </p><p>Department/CENTCOM.  See paras 9 and 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Summary:  MFA has delayed the Turkish Red Crescent\'s </p><p>planned delivery of aid to Iraq to April 28, but expanded it </p><p>from medicines only to include food and water.  Media and </p><p>parliamentarians may travel with the convoy, which is not </p><p>approved by the ICRC.  MFA has asked whether it can or should </p><p>provide its own military security for the convoy.  The </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent informed ICRC separately of the </p><p>shipment.  Embassy requests that preliminary information on </p><p>the convoy be passed to the HOC, CMOC and DART.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On April 24, Feza Ozturk, MFA Head of Department for </p><p>International Political Organizations, told Mission Disaster </p><p>Relief Officer (MDRO) that MFA and the Turkish Red Crescent </p><p>(TRC) had decided to postpone to the early morning of April </p><p>28 and to expand the scope of the proposed aid shipment for </p><p>Iraq (ref A).  The Turks plan to send a total of 12 vehicles </p><p>(5 trucks, 4 ambulances, 2 communications vehicles, 1 </p><p>Volkswagen minibus) carrying medical supplies, food, and </p><p>water to hospitals in Mosul and Kirkuk.  Up to 28 persons, </p><p>including two (unidentified) members of Parliament and at </p><p>least one media representative (from TRT - state </p><p>radio/television), will travel in the convoy.  MFA </p><p>anticipates a one or two day presence in Iraq, except for the </p><p>ambulances and their staff which might stay on for three to </p><p>four days.  Ozturk stated frankly that this would be done </p><p>with or without the approval of the International Committee </p><p>of the Red Cross (ICRC), though he said that MFA would inform </p><p>the ICRC of its plans.  He related that this decision had </p><p>been made by the Prime Minister.  MFA will send complete </p><p>details to Embassy on this convoy by April 25. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) MDRO advised Ozturk that neither the Disaster </p><p>Assistance Response Team (DART) nor the Civil Military </p><p>Operations Center (CMOC) were prepared to identify hospitals </p><p>in need of medical supplies at this point, and that they </p><p>strongly recommended coordination of aid with the ICRC.  He </p><p>also passed on the DART/CMOC assessment that areas north/east </p><p>of the green line were permissive, as is Kirkuk.  Mosul is </p><p>not currently fully permissive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) MDRO asked Ozturk whether the donors had verified </p><p>that Mosul and Kirkuk hospitals were in need of and willing </p><p>to accept these supplies.  Ozturk responded that MFA had not </p><p>checked, but would do so.  However, he stated that he assumed </p><p>that all hospitals in Iraq were in need of this kind of aid. </p><p>Note:  Ozturk did not identify the hospitals by name, but </p><p>said that the convoy would deliver all materials to the </p><p>"largest state hospitals" in Mosul and Kirkuk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Security:  Ozturk reiterated Turkey\'s offer to provide </p><p>its own security (Turkish Special Forces) for the convoy if </p><p>the U.S. side believed that the situation surrounding this </p><p>aid shipment was not secure.  Ozturk also stated that the </p><p>Turkish side would inform the KDP and PUK of its intention to </p><p>send this convoy.  MDRO responded that he would check this </p><p>"offer" with Task Force North and get back to MFA.  Task </p><p>Force North maintains that no Turkish military forces of any </p><p>kind should enter Iraq to escort the convoy.  MDRO will </p><p>report this to MFA on April 28. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) ICRC\'s View:  Finn Ruda, ICRC Regional </p><p>Representative, told MDRO that ICRC had offered the Turks </p><p>several options for delivery of aid through ICRC channels </p><p>during the week of April 28, but that TRC preferred to go it </p><p>alone.  However, Ruda was informed that TRC planned to send </p><p>its convoy on April 25.  Note:  MDRO subsequently confirmed </p><p>that TRC plans to send the convoy April 28, not/not April 25. </p><p> End Note. </p><p>Action Requests: </p><p>---------------- </p><p>9. (U) Embassy requests that information on this convoy be </p><p>shared with the Humanitarian Operations Center in Kuwait, as </p><p>well as the CMOC and DART team in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) We note in ref C information that CENTCOM would </p><p>support efforts by other coalition partners to "adopt" </p><p>hospitals in Iraq and ask whether CENTCOM can recommend a </p><p>hospital to be paired with the Turks. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
