(U) AMIDST MUCH FANFARE, LEBANESE AUTHORITIES </p><p>HAVE SET OUT THE FIRST STEPS OF WHAT IS ULTIMATELY </p><p>INTENDED TO BE A NEW SECURITY PLAN FOR BEIRUT </p><p>AIRPORT.  THE PLAN WAS REPORTEDLY DRAWN UP AT A </p><p>MEETING HELD AT THE AIRPORT ON JULY 3 WHICH WAS </p><p>ATTENDED BY AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICIALS AND </p><p>MILITIA REPRESENTATIVES, AND IS THEORETICALLY </p><p>TO BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) IN A SEPARATE BUT RELATED DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>PRESIDENT GEMAYEL, AT A JULY 4 MEETING AT THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL PALACE ATTENDED BY A WHO\'S WHO OF </p><p>THE LEBANESE MILITARY, INTELLIGENCE, SECURITY, </p><p>CUSTOMS, AND AVIATION SECTORS (AS WELL AS THE </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY), </p><p>INSTRUCTED THE PARTICIPANTS TO DRAW UP A SIX- </p><p>PRONGED CAMPAIGN TO COUNTER THE U.S. MOVES TO </p><p>SHUT DOWN THE AIRPORT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) UNDER THE SECURITY PLAN, ARMED MILITIAMEN </p><p>WOULD BE BARRED FROM THE AIRPORT, ALL UNAUTHORIZED </p><p>ENTRANCES TO THE TWO RUNWAYS WOULD BE CLOSED OFF, </p><p>AND CARS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO APPROACH THE MAIN </p><p>TERMINAL BUILDING.  BEIRUT TELEVISION THURSDAY </p><p>EVENING SHOWED FOOTAGE OF DIRT BERMS BEING CON- </p><p>STRUCTED TO BLOCK TWO DIRT ROADS LEADING TO THE </p><p>RUNWAYS, AND MEMBERS OF THE LAF SIXTH BRIGADE </p><p>RIGOROUSLY SEARCHING PASSENGERS BOARDING MEA </p><p>FLIGHTS AT THE AIRPORT.  THE PRESS QUOTES </p><p>AIRPORT SECURITY PERSONNEL AS SAYING THAT THE </p><p>PLAN WILL BE OBSERVED BY ALL PARTIES DUE TO A </p><p>HIGH LEVEL "POLITICAL DECISION." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) CONTROVERSY OVER THE SECURITY PLAN HAS </p><p>ALREADY BROKEN OUT.  GEN. YASSIN SWAYD, THE HEAD </p><p>OF THE AIRPORT SECURITY APPARATUS, WHO SUBMITTED </p><p>HIS RESIGNATION SEVERAL MONTHS AGO TO PROTEST THE </p><p>CHAOS AT THE AIRPORT, ANNOUNCED THURSDAY THAT HE </p><p>WILL NOT RETURN TO HIS JOB.  (THE GOL HAS NOT </p><p>ACCEPTED HIS RESIGNATION.)  SWAYD, WHO ATTENDED </p><p>THE THURSDAY MEETING AT BA\'ABDA, PROTESTED THAT </p><p>IN SPITE OF PRESS REPORTS THAT MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>AIRPORT\'S SECURITY APPARATUS ATTENDED THE WEDNESDAY </p><p>NIGHT MEETING AT WHICH THE SECURITY PLAN WAS DRAWN </p><p>UP, THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.  MOREOVER, HE SAID, </p><p>"THE SITUATION AT THE AIRPORT WILL REMAIN AS IT </p><p>IS UNTIL THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT FORCES TAKE </p><p>REAL CONTROL OF THE AIRPORT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE SIX-PRONGED PLAN ORDERED BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT TO COUNTER THE U.S. MEASURES INVOLVES A </p><p>SERIES OF "LOCAL, ARAB, AND INTERNATIONAL MOVES </p><p>TO EXPLAIN LEBANON\'S POSITION, AND THE MEASURES THAT </p><p>LEBANON MIGHT TAKE TO PROTECT ITS RIGHTS AND TO </p><p>PREVENT THE DAMAGE THAT MIGHT BE CAUSED TO ITS </p><p>ECONOMY, NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>REPUTATION."  THE PLAN WOULD INVOLVE A DIPLOMATIC </p><p>OFFENSIVE, WHILE TASK FORCES HAVE BEEN CREATED IN </p><p>THE AREAS OF DIPLOMACY, POLITICS, SECURITY, </p><p>INFORMATION, CIVIL AVIATION, AND "ELECTRONIC </p><p>FACILITIES."  A MILITARY SECURITY COMMITTEE, </p><p>HEADED BY ARMY COMMANDER GEN. \'AWN, WAS CHARGED </p><p>WITH DRAFTING A SECURITY PLAN (APPARENTLY SEPARATE </p><p>FROM THAT ALREADY DRAWN UP) TO CONTROL THE SITUATION </p><p>INSIDE AND AROUND THE AIRPORT.  ARMY CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF GEN. MAHMUD TAY ABU DARGHAM WILL CHAIR A </p><p>COMMITTEE "TO ENSURE SECURITY BASED ON A POLITICAL </p><p>AGREEMENT," MFA SYG TURK WILL HEAD THE COMMITTEE </p><p>ON A DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE.  THE SIX TASK FORCES </p><p>ARE SCHEDULED TO MEET AGAIN ON TUESDAY, JULY 16. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  THE JADED LEBANESE HAVE LONG </p><p>BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING SECURITY CONCERNS </p><p>ADDRESSED BY YET ANOTHER "SECURITY PLAN."  THE </p><p>GOL HAS OUTDONE ITSELF IN SPADES THIS TIME, WITH </p><p>THE HAPLESS GEN. DARGHAM HAVING DRAWN THE UNENVIABLE </p><p>TASK OF RESOLVING THE KEY PROBLEM OF ENSURING </p><p>SECURITY BASED ON A POLITICAL AGREEMENT--A GOAL </p><p>WHICH HAS ELUDED THE LEBANESE FOR THE PAST TEN </p><p>YEARS OF CIVIL WAR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
