<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000949 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; S/CT, DRL; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  06/03/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, EAID, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Tigers continue to flex muscles in Jaffna </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 939, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Poloff traveled to Jaffna in northern </p><p>Sri Lanka, May 28-29.  Amid signs of pervasive Tamil </p><p>Tiger influence, residents urged the GSL to meet Tiger </p><p>conditions, so the group would attend the Tokyo donors </p><p>conference.  Meanwhile, as they have on previous Mission </p><p>visits, Tamils cited frustration with the military over </p><p>its control of large-scale "high security zones."  Amid </p><p>the rumblings, the best that could be said of Jaffna was </p><p>that the situation remained a far, far cry from the </p><p>years of war.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) A QUIET JAFFNA:  On May 28-29, poloff and pol </p><p>FSN traveled to Jaffna Peninsula on one of Mission\'s </p><p>regular visits to the war-torn region.  (Note:  In a </p><p>rare visit, the team also visited Kayts Island, just off </p><p>the southwest coast of the Peninsula -- See Paras 7-8.) </p><p>Jaffna was largely quiet, at least on the surface. </p><p>Poloff talked freely and openly with a wide variety of </p><p>residents.  People strolled the streets peaceably, </p><p>schoolchildren in bright uniforms rode bicycles </p><p>laughing, and shops had a variety of goods for sale </p><p>(though markedly less than that available in Colombo and </p><p>other Sri Lankan cities). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) TIGERS TO TOKYO, OR NOT:  In poloff\'s meetings, </p><p>one issue that was on everyone\'s minds was whether the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) would attend the </p><p>Tokyo donors conference.  (Note:  In late April, the </p><p>Tigers announced that they would not attend Tokyo.  The </p><p>GSL, the Norwegian facilitators, and the Japanese have </p><p>been trying feverishly to convince the LTTE to reverse </p><p>its decision -- See Reftels.)  Nearly all the Tamils </p><p>that poloff spoke to wanted the LTTE to go to Tokyo, and </p><p>urged the government to meet LTTE demands re the </p><p>formation of a north/east interim administration as soon </p><p>as possible.  Many interlocutors also urged the USG to </p><p>"pressure" the GSL and the LTTE to resolve their </p><p>disputes, so that rehabilitation work could begin right </p><p>away.  While opinion was mixed among interlocutors on </p><p>whether the Tigers would actually attend the upcoming </p><p>Tokyo conference (most did not think so), the desire for </p><p>rehabilitation in the north and east came through loud- </p><p>and-clear.  Characterizing the Tigers as "very </p><p>concerned" with the administration of aid, Tamil Eelam </p><p>Liberation Organization (TELO) MP K.Sivajilingam cited </p><p>Tamil fears that aid pledged at the upcoming Tokyo </p><p>conference would and go to the south, when it was most </p><p>needed in the north and east.  (Note: In spite of the </p><p>comments of some Tamils, some international assistance </p><p>is indeed finding its way to Jaffna.  Poloff visited a </p><p>State Department-funded demining site located 20 </p><p>kilometers outside of Jaffna town.  Per Reftel, the </p><p>Quick Reaction Demining Force team has been extremely </p><p>successful in removing mines and unexploded ordnance.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) FRUSTRATION WITH MILITARY RUNS HIGH:  As they </p><p>have during past visits by Mission personnel, Tamils </p><p>cited a high degree of frustration with the presence of </p><p>the Sri Lankan military\'s "high security zones." </p><p>Echoing the LTTE\'s long-standing demand, Tamils </p><p>underscored that Jaffna would not be restored to </p><p>normality until Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were </p><p>allowed to return to their homes within the security </p><p>zones.  (Note:  The military\'s "high security zones" and </p><p>other posts occupy about 18 percent of the land area in </p><p>Jaffna District.  The GSL continues to review various </p><p>ways to shift around troops, so as to minimize the </p><p>impact of the zones on Jaffna residents, while allowing </p><p>IDPs to return.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) LTTE\'S PERVASIVE INFLUENCE:  As for the LTTE, it </p><p>was clear to poloff -- based on his discussions and </p><p>observations -- that Tiger influence in Jaffna is </p><p>pervasive.  Contacts made clear that -- despite military </p><p>patrols and some checkpoints -- LTTE cadre move with </p><p>impunity about the streets of Jaffna town and anywhere </p><p>else, making no secret of their presence.  Poloff, for </p><p>example, was witness to one instance of apparent LTTE </p><p>grandstanding:  Three suspected Tigers -- one armed with </p><p>what appeared to be a revolver -- loitered outside </p><p>poloff\'s hotel while he was engaged in meetings. </p><p>Although they did not directly threaten poloff or </p><p>apparently anyone else, the message was clear that the </p><p>LTTE is watching the Jaffna situation with great </p><p>interest.  (Note:  Per the terms of the February </p><p>ceasefire accord and the late 2002 legalization of the </p><p>group, unarmed LTTE personnel are allowed to move about </p><p>in Sri Lanka.  What is different in Jaffna today </p><p>compared with last year is that the group seems to be </p><p>making use of that right more and more.  Per poloff\'s </p><p>experience mentioned above, some LTTE cadre also seem to </p><p>be cutting corners and to be carrying arms.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) FEAR OF THE TIGER:  There was a lot of concern </p><p>about the spreading tentacles of the LTTE.  Tamil </p><p>National Alliance (TNA) MP N. Raviraj cited what he </p><p>called the LTTE\'s "repression through fear" of "all </p><p>people" in Jaffna.  He said Tamils were angered by the </p><p>group\'s use of taxation and forcible recruitment. </p><p>(Note:  Representatives of the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission, "SLMM," also told poloff that they </p><p>had evidence of large-scale recruitment efforts by the </p><p>Tigers.  SLMM contacts were not sure how many of the </p><p>recruits might be children, but there seemed to be </p><p>some.)  Raviraj further stated that the LTTE allows </p><p>precious little political dissent either, often </p><p>threatening Tamils who oppose the group in private </p><p>conversations, or in public.  All that said, Raviraj and </p><p>other contacts said the LTTE seemed to be open to some </p><p>forms of discussion, as long as opinions were expressed </p><p>in careful, nuanced fashion.  (Note:  Raviraj, while not </p><p>anti-LTTE, has long expressed concerns about the LTTE\'s </p><p>use of intimidatory tactics in Jaffna and elsewhere in </p><p>Sri Lanka.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) DIFFICULTIES ABOUND ON KAYTS:  In a rare visit </p><p>by Mission personnel to Kayts, poloff met with the </p><p>Government Agent (GA) there, V. Selvanayagam. </p><p>Explaining the political situation, the GA noted that </p><p>the people of Kayts existed among three competing </p><p>forces:  the LTTE, the Sri Lankan Navy, and the anti- </p><p>LTTE Eelam People\'s Democratic Party (EPDP).  (Note: </p><p>Kayts and other islands off Jaffna have long been a </p><p>stronghold of the EPDP, a former Tamil paramilitary </p><p>group.  EPDP influence on Kayts was reinforced by </p><p>assistance from its allies in the Sri Lankan military, </p><p>but that link has been weakening during the course of </p><p>the peace process.)  Characterizing the centrally based </p><p>position of the Kayts Navy base as a "hand on the </p><p>throat" of the people, the GA said there was little sign </p><p>that political tensions among the three contending </p><p>groups would decline soon.  (Note:  Based on poloff\'s </p><p>observations, the LTTE seems to be quickly gaining the </p><p>upper hand in Kayts.  The group had recently opened up a </p><p>spanking new office on the island.  In the meantime, </p><p>EPDP posters on the island had been systematically </p><p>defaced, apparently by LTTE cadre.  In addition, in </p><p>recent incidents of small-scale violence, the LTTE has </p><p>reportedly got the better of the EPDP, which -- per the </p><p>ceasefire accord -- has been largely and controversially </p><p>disarmed.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Re the island\'s apparent lack of basic services, </p><p>the GA laid out in stark terms the harsh realities </p><p>governing the area.  Electricity, provided by </p><p>generators, is available for only seven and a half-hours </p><p>a day.  Phone service is next to nonexistent, with the </p><p>GA having to drive or walk one kilometer into a nearby </p><p>town to use one of the few phone lines.  There are no </p><p>buses, no hospitals or doctors, and if injuries occur, </p><p>the patient has to face a grueling 15-kilometer long </p><p>drive to Jaffna, partly accomplished by a causeway that </p><p>is barely above sea level. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  There was a lot of rumblings in </p><p>Jaffna, with Tamils worried about the military and the </p><p>LTTE.  In the meantime, Kayts Island seemed tense with </p><p>the ascendant LTTE challenging long-standing military </p><p>and EPDP control.  Given these negative vibrations, the </p><p>best that could be said of Jaffna was that the situation </p><p>was a far, far cry from the years of when the Peninsula </p><p>was literally torn apart by the war.  Tamils, in </p><p>general, seem to realize that and to be counting their </p><p>blessings, though it is not clear whether the LTTE is on </p><p>the same page.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
