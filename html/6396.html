<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 000918 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC AND NEA/ARP </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/MAC/AME </p><p>DOE FOR IE - L. COBURN AND C. WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT OIL SITREP 3/13/03 </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 898 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A Senior KPC official informed Embassy late afternoon </p><p>of March 12 that Kuwaiti production reached 2.4 mmbd.  The </p><p>source noted that Embassy should watch the newspapers on 3/13 </p><p>for further details. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Local press reports on March 13 quoted Nader </p><p>Al-Sultan, CEO of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, as saying </p><p>that Kuwait had raised production to its maximum capacity of </p><p>2.4 mmbd.  He denied earlier reports that oil wells had been </p><p>shut in and said all wells and refineries would continue to </p><p>operate in spite of hostilities.  Sultan told the Kuwait News </p><p>Agency (KUNA) that the maximum output would be maintained for </p><p>a brief period, but gave no specific time span.  He added </p><p>that KPC has prepared several scenarios for war contingencies </p><p>with the aim to maintain production, exports and strategic </p><p>stock while protecting workers and facilities. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The press reports note the inconsistency between </p><p>Sultan\'s remarks and March 4 remarks by KOC CEO Ahmed </p><p>Al-Arbeed, who told reporters earlier that Northern oilfields </p><p>would be closed in the event of hostilities, slashing the </p><p>countries output by up to 700,000 bpd (Reftel).  A KPC source </p><p>told the Embassy that Arbeed had spoken out of turn, and had </p><p>been reprimanded for the statement. </p><p> </p><p>4.
