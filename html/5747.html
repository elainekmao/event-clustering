<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000443 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/BTA EB/ESC/ISC (MCMANUS AND ERVITI), </p><p>WHA/CAN (MASON AND RUNNING), OES/EGC (MIOTKE AND </p><p>DEROSA), D/HS (OPTICAN) AND PM (MARKOFF) </p><p> </p><p>HOMELAND SECURITY FOR EPR (BROWN) </p><p> </p><p>DOE FOR IE-141 (DEUTSCH) </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4320/MAC/WH/ON/OIA/BENDER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, EINV, CA, Security and Prosperity Partnership </p><p>SUBJECT:  CANADIAN CEO\'S PUSH "NORTH AMERICAN SECURITY AND </p><p>       PROSPERITY" INITIATIVE IN WASHDC ON APRIL 7 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   THE CANADIAN COUNCIL OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES </p><p>(CEOCOUNCIL.CA), THE ORGANIZATION WHICH BUILT NORTH AMERICAN </p><p>BUSINESS SUPPORT FOR U.S.-CANADA FREE TRADE IN THE 1980\'S </p><p>(AND THEREBY BUILT MUCH OF THE FRAMEWORK FOR NAFTA AND </p><p>FTAA), IS LAUNCHING A SIMILARLY AMBITIOUS AGENDA FOR THE </p><p>CONTINENT\'S TRILATERAL FUTURE.  CCEA PRESIDENT TOM D\'AQUINO </p><p>WILL PRESENT THIS PLAN TO U.S. CEO\'S IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ON </p><p>APRIL 7. </p><p> </p><p>2.   D\'AQUINO POSSESSES STRONG CREDIBILITY IN CANADA BASED </p><p>ON HIS PERSONAL LEADERSHIP OF THE LOBBY FOR BILATERAL FREE </p><p>TRADE IN THE 1980\'S.  INITIALLY HIS ORGANIZATION - THEN </p><p>CALLED THE BUSINESS COUNCIL ON NATIONAL ISSUES -- FACED </p><p>DISMISSAL OR SKEPTICISM, BUT D\'AQUINO EVENTUALLY BECAME A </p><p>PUBLIC FACE (SECOND TO THEN PRIME MINISTER BRIAN MULRONEY) </p><p>OF THE VICTORIOUS PRO-FTA SIDE IN CANADA\'S DECISIVE 1988 </p><p>ELECTION CAMPAIGN.  AS D\'AQUINO ENJOYS NOTING, THE DOOMSDAY </p><p>ECONOMIC SCENARIOS WHICH HIS CRITICS THEN FORECAST HAVE BEEN </p><p>"SPECTACULARLY FULFILLED, IN REVERSE" BY CANADA\'S SUBSEQUENT </p><p>TRADE AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. </p><p> </p><p>2.   THE "NORTH AMERICAN SECURITY AND PROSPERITY" INITIATIVE </p><p>IS OUTLINED AT LENGTH IN A PRESENTATION ON CCCE\'S WEBSITE </p><p>(CEOCOUNCIL.CA).  D\'AQUINO STRESSES THAT IT DOES NOT/NOT </p><p>PROPOSE A CUSTOMS OR CURRENCY UNION, COMMON MARKET, UNION OF </p><p>FOREIGN/DEFENSE POLICIES, OR SUPRANATIONAL GOVERNMENT. </p><p>RATHER, ITS KEY POINTS ARE: </p><p> </p><p>(I) MAKING THE U.S.-CANADA BORDER A "ZONE OF COOPERATION," </p><p>NOT A LINE OF DEFENSE; MOVING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AWAY </p><p>FROM THE BORDER ITSELF; AND MAKING THE BORDER "AN EFFECTIVE, </p><p>SHARED CHECKPOINT WITHIN AN INTEGRATED ECONOMIC SPACE." </p><p> </p><p>(II) REGULATORY INTEGRATION TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY.  THREE </p><p>SENSITIVE AREAS ARE RECOGNIZED:  THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF </p><p>TRADE REMEDY LAWS WITH AN INTEGRATED MARKET; THE NEED TO </p><p>REMOVE RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS AND OWNERSHIP IN BIG </p><p>INDUSTRIES; AND IMPEDIMENTS TO THE MOBILITY OF SKILLED </p><p>LABOR. </p><p> </p><p>(III) BUILDING RESOURCE SECURITY BASED ON OPEN MARKETS AND </p><p>REGULATORY COMPATIBILITY, ON THE PATTERN NOW WORKING SO WELL </p><p>IN ENERGY MARKETS - WITH PERMANENT RESOLUTION OF PRICING AND </p><p>SUBSIDIES ISSUES IN OTHER RESOURCE INDUSTRIES, SUCH AS </p><p>FOREST PRODUCTS AND AGRICULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>(IV) MEETING HOMELAND SECURITY NEEDS, WITH CANADA AFFIRMING </p><p>ITS SOVEREIGNTY BY MAKING A VASTLY MORE EFFECTIVE </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO ITS OWN DEFENSE, MOVING TO A NEW PHASE OF </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES ON CONTINENTAL SECURITY, </p><p>AND BEING AN EFFECTIVE PLAYER IN THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO COMBAT </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>(V) BUILDING TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY INSTITUTIONS.  NAFTA NEVER </p><p>PRETENDED TO OFFER A FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING ALL CONTINENTAL </p><p>ISSUES, AND THE EU (SUPRANATIONAL) MODEL IS NOT APPROPRIATE </p><p>FOR NORTH AMERICA.  SPECIALIZED, EXPERT JOINT COMMISSIONS, </p><p>ON THE PATTERN OF THE U.S.-CANADA INTERNATIONAL JOINT </p><p>COMMISSION (IJC), MIGHT OFFER A BETTER MODEL FOR </p><p>IMPLEMENTING NASP AMONG THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND </p><p>MEXICO. </p><p> </p><p>3.   COMMENT:  MISSION CANADA HAS WITNESSED MANY INITIATIVES </p><p>TOWARD GREATER U.S.-CANADA INTEGRATION OVER THE YEARS SINCE </p><p>THE BILATERAL FTA WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED IN 1989.  OF THESE, </p><p>THE RIDGE-MANLEY SMART BORDER PROCESS STANDS OUT AS HAVING </p><p>DELIVERED THE SWIFTEST AND MOST RECENT RESULTS.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THE CCCE\'S NASP INITIATIVE MAY HOLD LONGER-TERM </p><p>PROMISE.  FIRST, IT FOLLOWS AND BUILDS UPON THE RIDGE-MANLEY </p><p>PROCESS.  SECOND, IT ORIGINATES WITH MAJOR BUSINESSES, THE </p><p>GROUP BEST ABLE TO PROVIDE DETERMINED, BOTTOM-UP LEADERSHIP </p><p>OF THE SCOPE LIKELY TO BE REQUIRED.  THIRD, NASP CONFORMS TO </p><p>OUR OWN VISION OF A DESIRABLE AND ATTAINABLE AGENDA FOR </p><p>BILATERAL INTEGRATION.  ITS INCLUSION OF A MAJOR </p><p>SECURITY/DEFENSE COMPONENT IS BOTH ITS STRENGTH (NASP </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGES THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ELEMENT TO THE USG, </p><p>THOUGH D\'AQUINO STRESSES THAT THE GOC MUST INVEST IN </p><p>SECURITY FOR ITS OWN SAKE, NOT MERELY AS A CONCESSION) AND </p><p>ITS WEAKNESS (AT LEAST UNTIL NOW, THE GOC HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>PREPARED TO MAKE DEFENSE INVESTMENTS ON THE SCALE CALLED FOR </p><p>UNDER NASP). </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
