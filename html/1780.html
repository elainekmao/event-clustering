<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001449 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/22/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, SOCI, KISL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR VISITS SOKOTO STATE: OFR </p><p>SUPPORTED, SHARIA DISCUSSED </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard f. Jeter, reason 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) In his first trip to the Northwest, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>travelled to Sokoto State on June 19 and 20 to hold meetings </p><p>with Governor Bafarawa, Sultan of Sokoto Maccido and Brigade </p><p>One Commander General Emejuru.  The Ambassador thanked the </p><p>officials for their support for Operation Focus Relief Phase </p><p>I training that took place in Sokoto State last Autumn, and </p><p>asked for their support for future training in the Northwest </p><p>region.  Governor Bafarawa described his Administration\'s </p><p>progress, and his low-key approach to Sharia (and the </p><p>limitations of his non-confrontational style).  Both he, the </p><p>Sultan and General Emerju pledged support for OFR III.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Governor </p><p>------------ </p><p>2.  (C) Governor Attahiru Bafarawa welcomed the Ambassador </p><p>and the Embassy delegation, including the USAID Director, </p><p>DATT and Poloff, with a State Dinner on the 19th, followed by </p><p>a private meeting on the 20th.  The Ambassador began the </p><p>discussion by asking what gains democracy had brought Sokoto </p><p>State in the past two years.  The Governor responded, "the </p><p>difference between military government and democracy is that </p><p>I am from Sokoto State, I am responsible to my people and I </p><p>am not going anywhere."  This compared favorably to military </p><p>Governors from other parts of the country who, he said, did </p><p>not dare return to their former constituency, given their </p><p>wholesale theft of funds while in office.  As an example of </p><p>his fiscal rectitude, Bafarawa said that Sokoto State,s </p><p>budget for the past two years had been approximately 8.6 </p><p>billion naira (about USD 80 million).  He said of that </p><p>amount, most of the money has gone to building roads, </p><p>schools, hospitals and rural development (usually potable </p><p>water) projects.  The Governor noted, with some degree of </p><p>pride, that he had paid off 700 million naira in outstanding </p><p>debts from the former military administration and had set </p><p>aside one billion naira in an emergency fund.  "Without </p><p>borrowing a penny," Bafarawa stated with a broad smile. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On corruption, Barfarawa said that he is firmly in </p><p>control of State Government officials: "If the leader is </p><p>corrupt, the whole body will be corrupt--if the leader </p><p>steals, everyone looks to get his share."  When asked his </p><p>assessment of the Obasanjo Administration\'s sincerity in its </p><p>anti-corruption efforts, Bafarawa said flatly that the </p><p>President\'s Ministers are corrupt. Foremost on his list of </p><p>corrupt officials was Tony Anenih, Minister of Works and </p><p>Housing.  Bafarawa said that if Obasanjo meant to make </p><p>serious inroads into corruption, he would have to forego the </p><p>complicated zoning arrangements that keep certain Ministries </p><p>tied to certain states, and hire the most competent people he </p><p>could find.  (Comment:  Corruption within Federal Ministries </p><p>is indeed rife. Anenih appears untouchable, given his </p><p>position as one of Obasanjo,s key political &fixers.8  End </p><p>comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Asked about the performance of local government </p><p>officials, the Governor opined that the Federal Government </p><p>was "complicit" in their "looting."   The 20 percent </p><p>apportionment that Local Government Councils (LGC) received </p><p>from the federal government was paid directly to LGCs, </p><p>instead of being funneled through state governments as </p><p>required by the Constitution.  "Since they have control of </p><p>their own money, there is little I can do to stop them from </p><p>stealing it."  He complained bitterly about ALGON (All Local </p><p>Government Association of Nigeria), which had been set up by </p><p>the Federal Government in Abuja to direct LGA spending.  He </p><p>repeated the well-publicized case of ALGON\'s purchase of </p><p>Toyota Prados for the 774 LGC\'s without their permission--a </p><p>contract alleged to have been arranged by Vice President </p><p>Atiku Abubakar, and to have netted roughly USD 30,000 per </p><p>vehicle in kick-backs to various federal officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) On Sharia reforms in the North, Bafarawa professed a </p><p>low-key approach.  "If Sharia is done properly, no one will </p><p>notice.  It has always been a part of our religion and </p><p>culture."  Alluding to Governor Ahmed Sani of Zamfara State </p><p>andhis intrusive and controversial Sharia regime, Bafarawa </p><p>said that Sharia "only becomes dangerous when it is used for </p><p>political gain."  Bafarawa noted the recent meeting in Abuja </p><p>between National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed and </p><p>Governors from eleven Northern states which had adopted new </p><p>Sharia legislation, a session devoted to "harmonization" of </p><p>Sharia approaches, in an attempt to prevent Sharia from being </p><p>used as a political tool by their opponents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Bafarawa mentioned that one local Sharia judge in </p><p>Sokoto had handed down a sentence of amputation for a </p><p>confessed thief, and that the defendant refused to appeal. </p><p>Bafarawa had set up a committee of Sharia scholars to review </p><p>the case, and to determine whether the case met all the </p><p>elements required for imposing amputation under classical </p><p>Sharia doctrine.  The Governor said that he would allow the </p><p>sentence to be carried out if the committee sustains the </p><p>judge\'s decision.  "It\'s not my business.  I am not the </p><p>judge, and this is what the people have asked for."  He said </p><p>he could over-ride the judgment of a Shari\'a court--even if </p><p>no appeal was filed--only when there were proper grounds for </p><p>doing so in classical Sharia law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador Jeter said that the USG\'s concern was </p><p>primarily for the potential impact of Sharia on non-Muslims, </p><p>and the human rights consequences that would follow. </p><p>Bararawa replied, "It is something to be handled with care." </p><p>He said that in Sokoto State, consumption of alcohol by </p><p>Christians in private is not criminalized, and in fact </p><p>alcohol is sold freely at Sokoto\'s military and police messes </p><p>and military grocery stores.  More importantly, none of the </p><p>laws regulating social comportment that had been passed in </p><p>Zamfara--requiring a dress code for women and banning </p><p>mixed-gender public transport--had been introduced in Sokoto, </p><p>the seat of the highest Muslim traditional authority in </p><p>Nigeria.  Public school classes were divided by gender after </p><p>a certain age, and more girls were being sent to school since </p><p>this change was imposed, he said.   Christian children in </p><p>Sokoto were taught "Christian religious knowledge," (CRK) </p><p>while their Muslim counterparts were instructed in the Koran, </p><p>he said (Comment: It is a long-running struggle throughout </p><p>Nigeria for religious minorities to be provided instruction </p><p>in their own faith in the public schools.  End Comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Governor Bafarawa articulated the perception by some </p><p>Northern governors and Northern populations--not often </p><p>expressed directly to USG officials--that the USG is more </p><p>interested in the South of Nigeria, and focuses more of its </p><p>energy and resources on Southern states.  That Ambassador </p><p>Jeter made his first official visit to Kaduna and Kano, and </p><p>was undertaking a trip to Kebbi and Sokoto so early in his </p><p>tenure, was taken as a sign of encouragement to Northern </p><p>governors that the USG would have a more "balanced" focus in </p><p>its outlook and programs, according to Bafarawa.  The </p><p>Ambassador stated that the USG regarded all of Nigeria as </p><p>worthy and deserving of support, and with the Embassy now </p><p>moved to Abuja from Lagos, including the recent transfer of </p><p>USAID operations to the capital, the USG would be able to </p><p>focus more attention and assistance resources in the North. </p><p>We want to help all of Nigeria, Ambassador Jeter emphasized. </p><p>USAID Director Tom Hobgood discussed with the Governor what </p><p>programs AID offered that provided assistance to the North </p><p>(there are too few), and what it could offer in the future. </p><p>Bafarawa replied that the primary needs of his state, and the </p><p>North in general, were in the areas of education, health </p><p>care, provision of potable water, and agriculture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The General </p><p>--------------- </p><p>9.  (U) The Ambassador met June 20 with General L. Emejuru, </p><p>One Brigade Commander in Sokoto, who commands all Nigerian </p><p>Army units in Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara.  The Ambassador </p><p>thanked the General for his assistance during Phase I of </p><p>Operation Focus Relief and asked for his continued support </p><p>for OFR III training in Birnin-Kebbi which would be </p><p>commencing in August.  The DATT provided an overview of what </p><p>that training would entail, and the General promised his </p><p>continued support for the mission.  He said that the training </p><p>and equipment would benefit the soldiers under his command, </p><p>and would assist them in enforcing peace in Sierra Leone.  He </p><p>thanked the Ambassador for the courtesy call, and requested </p><p>that the Commanding Officer of the Birnin-Kebbi barracks be </p><p>made aware of the USG trainers\' planned movements outside the </p><p>camp in order to provide adequate security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Sultan </p><p>------------- </p><p>10.  (SBU) Sultan of Sokoto Mahammadu Maccido, the formal </p><p>leader of all Muslims in Nigeria, also received the </p><p>Ambassador June 20.  The Ambassador, in a private sidebar, </p><p>thanked the Sultan for his support of last year\'s OFR </p><p>training in Sokoto.  The Sultan said that he was "displeased" </p><p>by reports that "hoodlums" had hijacked and burned beer </p><p>trucks in Kano, Katsina and Zamfara in the past months.  He </p><p>said that he was using the influence of his office to prevent </p><p>a recurrence of such incidents.  "I do not want Christians to </p><p>feel threatened by Sharia, or hoodlums to take the law into </p><p>their own hands." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>11.  (C) Civilian support for OFR, as in neighboring Kebbi </p><p>State (septel), appears genuine and enthusiastic in Sokoto. </p><p>Governor Bafarawa, generally regarded as one of the more </p><p>successful Northern executives, spoke frankly of his </p><p>administration, including his attempt to keep Sharia reforms </p><p>within manageable bounds.  However, his unwillingness to </p><p>overturn a sentence of amputation unless his committee of </p><p>religious experts deems it proper to do so shows the limits </p><p>he faces in an overwhelmingly Muslim state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The Sultan of Sokoto, formally the head of the </p><p>Muslim community in Nigeria, is in practice little more than </p><p>a figurehead (the Emir of Kano, for example, is far more </p><p>respected, and far more important).  The Sultan\'s pledge to </p><p>reduce Sharia "incidents" in neighboring states will have </p><p>little impact.  State Governors wield the real power, and </p><p>when they hesitate to act, or act at cross-purposes (as </p><p>Governor Sani of Zamfara) the Sultan can do little.  However, </p><p>most Northern Governors pursue the same low-key approach as </p><p>Bafarawa, and so far they have been largely successful in </p><p>limiting tension and discord resulting from the Sharia </p><p>"reform" movement.   End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
