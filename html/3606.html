<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001994 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: EDITORIAL ON WSSD </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Too many words, too little </p><p>      action," the independent weekly "The Financial Gazette" </p><p>      dedicated its August 29, 2002 editorial to the World </p><p>      Summit on Sustainable Development. Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Zimbabweans, as indeed many other Africans, will </p><p>      be forgiven if they dismiss as a circus the World </p><p>      Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) now under way </p><p>      in South Africa. . .  They and millions of others in </p><p>      the developing world are only acutely aware that too </p><p>      many similar talk shops have been staged before and the </p><p>      result has almost always been the same: no tangible </p><p>      improvement in the basic quality of their wretched </p><p>      lives. . .  The world\'s poor have now become used to </p><p>      helplessly watching their leaders gather for such lofty </p><p>      meetings at a great cost to formulate right-sounding </p><p>      policies and pledges which are quickly forgotten. </p><p> </p><p>       "The timing of the staging of the WSSD could </p><p>       not have been more ironic, or perhaps an eye- </p><p>       opener, for Zimbabwe. . .  Dubbed the Third </p><p>       Revolution, President Robert Mugabe\'s ruthless </p><p>       campaign to stay in power at whatever cost has </p><p>       been truly sobering to the nation.  A wasteland </p><p>       is all that remains of a country that was only </p><p>       rivaled in Africa at independence by economic </p><p>       powerhouses South Africa and Nigeria.  But </p><p>       Zimbabweans can be certain that Mugabe, when he </p><p>       joins other leaders at the WSSD, will make the </p><p>       usual positive declarations of eradicating </p><p>       poverty and disease and of empowering his </p><p>       nation and protecting its natural resources - </p><p>       the key goals of the summit.  And yet back </p><p>       home, the actions of his government will indeed </p><p>       highlight why such summits, at least for </p><p>       Africa, are useless talk shops that are better </p><p>       forgotten. </p><p> </p><p>       "Indeed Mugabe\'s weekend appointment of the </p><p>       so-called war Cabinet - a Cabinet whose mandate </p><p>       is to crush opponents and all voices of </p><p>       democracy - once again makes the point that he </p><p>       is determined to take Zimbabwe down with him at </p><p>       his suicidal path. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
