<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 002062 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR MELLE, CHANDLER, BALASSA, BURCKY AND SCHNARE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/BTA AND WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>DOC FOR ITA/MAC -- OFFICE OF NAFTA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, SCUL, CA </p><p>SUBJECT:  MAGAZINES:  GOC CUTS ITS MAGAZINE SUPPORT FUND, </p><p>       SAYS INDUSTRY IS "ON A SOLID FOOTING" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY.  NOT </p><p>FOR DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE USG CHANNELS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.   On July 8 the GOC announced cuts/changes to its funding </p><p>programs in support of Canadian magazines.  These programs </p><p>were the key measures put in place in 1999 following </p><p>resolution of a U.S.-Canada bilateral dispute concerning </p><p>periodicals.  In making the cuts, the GOC pronounced the </p><p>magazine industry to be "on a solid footing and enjoying </p><p>healthy growth" - a striking shift from predictions made in </p><p>1998-99 to the effect that any significant concession to the </p><p>U.S. meant disaster for the Canadian industry.  The GOC also </p><p>adjusted its programs in order to reach more and smaller </p><p>magazines - an open admission that its support measures have </p><p>tended to benefit relatively large, profitable media firms. </p><p>END SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND:  THE MAGAZINES DISPUTE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   Canada obtained exemptions from the 1989 FTA and 1994 </p><p>NAFTA for "cultural industries" (media), and the GOC </p><p>continues to maintain a range of policy measures to support </p><p>Canadian-owned "cultural" enterprises and encourage/require </p><p>the use of "Canadian content" in TV, radio and other media. </p><p>In the mid-1990\'s the United States challenged various GOC </p><p>measures to support Canadian magazines (the so-called </p><p>"Sports Illustrated" dispute).  Several of these measures </p><p>were found to be WTO-inconsistent by WTO panels.  Canada\'s </p><p>proposed replacement regime, Bill C-55, which the USG did </p><p>not consider adequate, became the focus of a highly </p><p>politicized bilateral dispute in 1998-99. </p><p> </p><p>3.   The controversy around this dispute in 1998-99 was far </p><p>out of proportion to the modest commercial interests at </p><p>stake for two reasons.  First, Canadian Heritage Minister </p><p>Sheila Copps, who still holds the portfolio, indulged in </p><p>considerable anti-U.S. rhetoric.  She warned publicly of an </p><p>impending "cultural onslaught" from U.S. publishers if they </p><p>were to obtain greater access to the Canadian advertising </p><p>market.  Second, Canadian media, which had a direct interest </p><p>in sustaining the GOC\'s cultural protections and subsidies, </p><p>presented the U.S. case less objectively than they might </p><p>have done. </p><p> </p><p>THE 1999 RESOLUTION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   Under the terms of an agreement reached in mid-1999, </p><p>U.S. magazines exported to Canada can now fill 18 percent of </p><p>total advertising space with ads aimed at Canadians. Canada </p><p>also committed to provide non-discriminatory tax treatment, </p><p>and to permit foreign ownership of magazine businesses. </p><p>Canada\'s magazine industry obtained a promise of substantial </p><p>direct subsidies to compensate for their reduced level of </p><p>trade protection.  This was introduced in 2000 via the </p><p>Canadian Magazine Fund and Publications Assistance Program, </p><p>which allocated an average of roughly C$70 million (US$50 </p><p>million) annually to the industry for three years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NO "CULTURAL ONSLAUGHT" </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.   Following the dispute\'s resolution, Canadian media </p><p>continued to suggest that "American" magazines were </p><p>preparing a major drive into the Canadian market against </p><p>which "Canadian" magazines were ill-equipped to compete. </p><p>However, contrary to many expectations, there was little </p><p>subsequent pressure from U.S.-based magazine publishers to </p><p>enter the Canadian market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUPPORT TRIMMED, SINCE INDUSTRY IS "SOLID" AND "HEALTHY" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.   On July 8, Canadian Heritage Minister Copps announced </p><p>changes to the three-year-old direct subsidy programs, </p><p>reducing GOC expenditures on these programs from C$78.1 </p><p>million last year (FY 2002-03) to C$61.4 million in three </p><p>years\' time (FY 2005-06).  Copps\' office declared that "the </p><p>Canadian periodical and magazine industry is now on a solid </p><p>footing and enjoying healthy growth.  Given these </p><p>developments, the Canadian Magazine Fund has been evaluated </p><p>and readjusted to a level that better reflects the Canadian </p><p>industry\'s current situation."  It also noted that more than </p><p>50 percent of the periodicals available in the Canadian </p><p>marketplace are Canadian, as are 12 of the 20 most popular </p><p>titles.  Finally, the Ministry restructured its programs in </p><p>order to deliver assistance to a larger number of smaller </p><p>publications - an implicit concession to long-standing </p><p>criticism (from both Canadian and U.S. observers) that, </p><p>while Copps portrayed herself as the defender of small, </p><p>struggling Canadian magazines, it was really large, </p><p>financially sound publishing firms who benefited the most </p><p>from both protection and subsidies. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.   COMMENT:  In retrospect, Minister Copps, and advocates </p><p>for the Canadian magazine industry (and cultural policy more </p><p>broadly), significantly overstated the menace posed by U.S. </p><p>publications to the Canadian industry in 1998-99, and the </p><p>announcement of cuts to GOC support for the industry is a </p><p>virtual admission of this.  Nevertheless, as a direct result </p><p>of the magazines dispute, Copps concluded that WTO panels </p><p>were likely to undermine Canadian cultural protections, and </p><p>that Canada therefore required a "New International Treaty </p><p>Instrument on Cultural Diversity" to buttress those </p><p>protections against WTO trade liberalization.  When </p><p>commenting on the GOC\'s drive for such a treaty, we might </p><p>wish to point out that it was originally sparked by fears </p><p>that the GOC now admits were not realized. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
