<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000250 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/EPPD/PD AND AF/PD </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR PADILLA </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS DEPT OF AGRICULTURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, TBIO, KPAO </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: WTO BIOTECH PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 21881 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. </p><p>REASON: 1.5 B & D. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The GON and the Nigerian public are split on the issue </p><p>of biotechnology. Senior GON officials and farmers recognize </p><p>that biotechnology promises improved agricultural </p><p>productivity. President Obasanjo has said, "I am convinced </p><p>that the only reliable way forward for rapid biotechnological </p><p>development in the country is a close and sustained </p><p>collaboration among government, researchers and industry." </p><p>Former Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Mallam </p><p>Adamu Bello said, "I\'m not a scientist, but from information </p><p>available to me, it appears clear that modern biotechnology </p><p>holds high promise." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) However, many agricultural experts in both the private </p><p>and public sectors have close professional connections to </p><p>Europe and are sympathetic to European opinions. This is </p><p>particularly true of Nigeria\'s limited agricultural export </p><p>sector, which exports mainly to Europe (though sometimes </p><p>through third countries--such as India--where processing </p><p>takes place) and could face the dilemma of having to chose </p><p>between biotechnology and continued access to European </p><p>markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In Nigeria, biotechnology is not generally viewed as a </p><p>tool used by the developed world to keep developing countries </p><p>impoverished. However, the WTO is often perceived in that </p><p>light and is publicly criticized as an arm of the developed </p><p>world. The Embassy, therefore, recommends that any </p><p>biotechnology outreach initiative focus on the positive </p><p>impact that biotechnology could have in Nigeria. The outreach </p><p>should not focus primarily on the WTO case against Europe. </p><p>Such a focus might obfuscate the issue by causing Nigerians </p><p>to believe that support for biotechnology and WTO are one in </p><p>the same, and such belief would not advance our interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Embassy\'s ongoing efforts in support of </p><p>biotechnology include a proposed U.S. press tour for Nigerian </p><p>journalists who cover biotechnology issues and a </p><p>comprehensive USAID proposal to support GON biotech efforts </p><p>through a Nigeria Agriculture Biotechnology Program. In 2002, </p><p>a large delegation from Iowa, led by the Governor, visited </p><p>Nigeria and extensively discussed biotechnology issues. The </p><p>University of Iowa expressed interest in doing work here, but </p><p>there has been little follow-up. Monsanto has also been a </p><p>frequent visitor to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background on Biotechnology in Nigeria </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) The GON national policy on biotechnology states: </p><p>"Nigeria should, as a priority, initiate appropriate steps to </p><p>explore the use of biotechnology for the benefit of Nigerians </p><p>and furthermore, ensure that Nigeria becomes a key </p><p>participant in the international biotechnology enterprise </p><p>within a decade. This will be pursued through the provision </p><p>of an enabling environment that responds to the needs of the </p><p>biotech industry, the research and development communities as </p><p>well as relevant national and international biotech concerns." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) In early 2002, the Federal Executive Council (Cabinet) </p><p>approved bio-safety guidelines that name the National </p><p>Bio-Safety Committee (NBC) as the nationally competent </p><p>authority for approving applications for the development, </p><p>importation, testing, release and/or commercialization of </p><p>GMOs or their products. The Ministry of Environment is </p><p>responsible for developing the guidelines under which the NBC </p><p>would approve an application, while the Ministry of Science </p><p>and Technology would be responsible for implementing those </p><p>guidelines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) On the research side, the Ministry of Science and </p><p>Technology oversees the National Biotechnology Development </p><p>Agency (NBDA), a government agency responsible for </p><p>coordinating all biotechnology activities in Nigeria. NBDA </p><p>had a 2002 budget of approximately N167 million (about $1.3 </p><p>million). The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development </p><p>and the Ministry of Environment also play key roles in </p><p>biotechnology research. In addition, the GON established an </p><p>advanced biotechnology laboratory within the Sheda Science </p><p>Complex (SHESTCO) near Abuja in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Comment: The positive actions and statements by the </p><p>GON hold promise for the development of a national capacity </p><p>in biotechnology that can spur growth in the agricultural </p><p>sector. However, constraints include the realities of </p><p>Nigeria\'s current (primarily European) export markets, </p><p>institutional and bureaucratic conflict, lack of scientific </p><p>capacity, and a need to dispel myths related to genetically </p><p>engineered foods. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
