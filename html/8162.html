DART Field Team West visited Samawah, the capital of Al </p><p>Muthanna governorate on 15 May.  Overall, vital services in </p><p>the city appear to be operating at pre-war levels. </p><p>Electricity and water remain sporadic.  Hospitals and public </p><p>health centers are operating, schools are open, stores and </p><p>markets are busy, and local government has been re- </p><p>established.  The DART held separate meetings with the </p><p>city\'s deputy mayor, representatives for the French NGO, </p><p>Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED), </p><p>and Coalition forces.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>MEETING WITH SAMAWAH DEPUTY MAYOR </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART met with the newly selected Deputy Mayor of </p><p>Samawa, a recently returned Iraqi exile who was selected by </p><p>the city council approximately three weeks ago.  The council </p><p>meets twice a week, and the Deputy Mayor meets three times a </p><p>week with Coalition personnel. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Deputy Mayor informed the DART that electricity, </p><p>which comes from An Nasiriyah, is sporadic.  Sometimes it </p><p>runs all day; on other days it only runs between three and </p><p>four hours per day.  (Note:  This was confirmed in </p><p>subsequent interviews with ACTED, local population, and </p><p>Coalition forces.  End Note.)  This, in turn, means that the </p><p>water system only functions sporadically.  According to the </p><p>Deputy Mayor, this problem existed before the war, but now </p><p>people\'s expectations are higher.  He stated,  "Now the </p><p>people ask for more because they have the freedom to talk." </p><p> </p><p>4.  The city has one general hospital and one </p><p>maternal/pediatric hospital.  There are 28 public health </p><p>centers in Al Muthana governorate.  All are operating and </p><p>have basic medical supplies.  (Note:  The DART did not visit </p><p>local health facilities due to time constraints, but relied </p><p>instead on information from the Deputy Mayor, ACTED, and </p><p>Coalition forces.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  Government services and systems are beginning to resume </p><p>function, and the Deputy Mayor reported that salaries have </p><p>been paid.  The USD 20 emergency stipend was also being </p><p>paid, and the DART witnessed the payment process at city </p><p>hall.  Garbage collection is also taking place, although at </p><p>reduced capacity due to the looting of some of the garbage </p><p>trucks.  The criminal justice system is functioning.  The </p><p>city council has selected three new judges who are </p><p>processing old cases.  The local police force is also </p><p>functioning.  Schools re-opened at the beginning of May. </p><p>The former regime had used 17 of the schools as ammunition </p><p>dumps, but Coalition forces have cleared all of these </p><p>schools of unexploded ordnance (UXO).  The local university </p><p>is scheduled to re-open on 17 May. </p><p> </p><p>6.  A local sheik has funded the establishment of a local </p><p>television station and a local weekly newspaper.  A crew </p><p>from the local television station was present during the </p><p>entire interview, and the event was filmed for the evening </p><p>news.  The newspaper also showed up later to photograph the </p><p>DART. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The public distribution system (PDS) is in place and </p><p>distributions are scheduled to resume at the beginning of </p><p>June.  There is a shortage of LPG cooking gas, but kerosene </p><p>is available and "affordable", according to the Deputy Mayor </p><p>and others present in the meeting.  The Deputy Mayor listed </p><p>as priorities improvements to the chronic problems of </p><p>electricity, water, and sewage. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>ACTED\'S RECOMMENDED INTERVENTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  ACTED representatives based in Samawah offered the DART </p><p>their opinions of the city and governorate\'s main problems </p><p>in water, sanitation, health, and agriculture, and potential </p><p>emergency solutions for water and sanitation.  Overall, most </p><p>problems in Samawah are chronic rather than symptoms caused </p><p>by the war, according to ACTED.  However, residents were apt </p><p>to complain because their expectations of Coalition-led </p><p>improvements were great. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The water from the Euphrates and most of the </p><p>governorate\'s water tables and canals is too salty for human </p><p>consumption.  Samawah\'s drinking water flows through a </p><p>faulty pipeline to its water-treatment center (WTC) from a </p><p>source located 20 kilometers to the north where there is a </p><p>pumping station and a WTC.  There are two compact units </p><p>midway in the pipeline that sends water to 10 to 15 </p><p>villages.  Most villages in Al Muthanna are not on the </p><p>pipeline and receive tankered water on an irregular basis. </p><p> </p><p>10.  ACTED proposes four immediate interventions: 1) repair </p><p>the leakage on the main pipeline that reduces capacity by 20 </p><p>percent; 2) improve the capacity of the WTCs in Ar Rumaythah </p><p>and Samawa, and the pumping station in Ar Rumaythah; 3) </p><p>rehabilitate the two compact units; and 4) develop a </p><p>comprehensive and regular rural water-distribution system </p><p>using tankers.  Some looted tankers would need to be </p><p>replaced and others added to reach full coverage. </p><p> </p><p>11.  With no sewage-sewer system, raw waste flows directly </p><p>into the Euphrates River via the storm-sewer system.  Many </p><p>neighborhoods rely on septic-system networks for every three </p><p>to four thousand people; however, some systems are blocked </p><p>and others not functioning.  ACTED proposes the following </p><p>sanitation interventions for Samawah: 1) clean the storm- </p><p>sewer system\'s pumping station and tanks that are filled </p><p>with sedimentation; 2) make emergency repairs and remove </p><p>overflowing waste from a particular neighborhood\'s septic </p><p>system that is faulty and is causing a health hazard; 3) </p><p>temporarily rent trucks to replace looted garbage trucks to </p><p>carry out solid-waste disposal; and 4) implement a rural </p><p>sanitation education program, promoting improved latrines </p><p>and sanitary methods. </p><p> </p><p>12.  ACTED found Samawah\'s two hospitals to be relatively </p><p>modern, "impressive," and with good doctors, athough they </p><p>lacked some basic medicines, oxygen, and blood-testing </p><p>capacity.  The hospitals also needed general maintenance. </p><p>The biggest problem for children was diarrhea, and for </p><p>adults, chest infections.  There were unsubstantiated fears </p><p>of typhoid fever, malaria, and cholera.  The one primary </p><p>health center ACTED visited lacked all basic drugs.  UXOs </p><p>were a serious rural, but not urban, problem. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Al Muthanna is slowly losing arable land as salty water </p><p>and poor irrigation erodes soil fertility, causing an </p><p>increasing rural livelihood problem.  This month, Al </p><p>Muthanna wheat farmers face calamity as the stalled Oil for </p><p>Food Program (OFF) prevents the purchase of local crops. </p><p>Farmers harvested their wheat earlier this month and are </p><p>storing it in their silos, unable to sell it to dealers who </p><p>would normally sell it to the government.  Al Muthanna </p><p>wheat, nearly the sole crop in Al Muthanna, yields a paltry </p><p>150 kilograms per "doneem," or quarter hectare.  It comes in </p><p>two varieties: 1) "Mastaback" wheat for human consumption; </p><p>and 2) "scheen" wheat for animals.  Before the war, farmers </p><p>had no incentive to diversify or seek other livelihood </p><p>initiatives because they became dependent on the OFF. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>MEETING WITH COALITION FORCES </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  The DART spoke briefly with Coalition forces, who </p><p>reported that a mass grave, containing between 100 and 600 </p><p>bodies, was found ten days ago on the outskirts of Samawah. </p><p>When uncovered, many, if not all seemed to have been </p><p>executed, including women and children.  Some had bullet </p><p>holes in their heads and others were bound and blindfolded. </p><p>The site is being secured 24 hours a day, seven days a week </p><p>by Coalition forces.  Asking if there is tension amongst the </p><p>community because of Coalition presence at the site, the </p><p>DART was told that the locals have usually been appreciative </p><p>of any military presence accorded to them. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Coalition forces are also working on the local justice </p><p>system in Samawah.  Three judges were appointed on 8 May by </p><p>the attorneys union and are currently trying cases.  Out of </p><p>seventeen judges, sixteen were fired because of their close </p><p>connection to the Ba\'ath Party and history of corruption. </p><p>Interestingly, because the laws significantly changed when </p><p>Saddam Hussein took over leadership of Iraq (generally not </p><p>for the better), the Coalition appointment letter to the </p><p>judges specifically includes language that states "You are </p><p>charged to enforce the good and just laws of the Iraqi </p><p>people." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
