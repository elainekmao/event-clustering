<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 04802 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: OADR: DECL </p><p>TAGS: PTER PGOV LE </p><p>SUBJECT: A BAD WEEK FOR BEIRUT </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) SUMMARY. THE WEEK AUGUST 11-18 WITNESSED THE WORST </p><p>OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE IN BEIRUT SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF THE SYRIAN SECURITY PLAN FOR WEST BEIRUT. TWO MASSIVE </p><p>CAR BOMBS ROCKED EAST BEIRUT ON AUGUST 14 AND 17, AND </p><p>SHELLING ACROSS THE GREENLINE INTENSIFIED UNTIL A </p><p>FRAGILE CEASEFIRE WAS PUT BACK IN PLACE ON AUGUST 15. </p><p>OTHER VIOLENCE WAS REPORTED IN ZAHLE, NEAR THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>CAMPS, AND IN TYRE. MEANWHILE THE INABILITY OF THE </p><p>CABINET TO MEET SYMBOLIZED THE CONTINUED STALL IN THE </p><p>POLITICAL PROCESS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) EARLY IN THE WEEK BLIND SHELLING ACROSS THE </p><p>GREEN LINE RESUMED, CULMINATING IN A SIX HOUR EXCHANGE </p><p>OF HEAVY ARTILLERY AND ROCKET FIRE ON AUGUST 15 THAT </p><p>ENDED FINALLY AT THE FOURTH ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE A CEASE- </p><p>FIRE. INTERMITTENT SHELLING HAS SINCE OCCURED, BUT AT </p><p>A REDUCED RATE. A WEDNESDAY NOON CAR BOMB IN SADD AL </p><p>BASHURIYAH CAUSED 13 DEATHS. </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) SATURDAY\'S CAR BOMB, OUTSIDE A BUSY SUPERMARKET </p><p>ON THE MAIN COASTAL ROAD IN ANTILYAS, CAUSED 67 DEATHS </p><p>AND 122 WOUNDED. MOST OF THE DEATHS WERE CAUSED BY THE </p><p>FIRE  THAT TRAPPED SHOPPERS AND EMPLOYEES INSIDE THE </p><p>BOMBED BUILDING, BUT THE BLAST ITSELF, ESTIMATED AT THE </p><p>FORCE OF 1,000 KILOS OF TNT, WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO HURL </p><p>FIVE BODIES ACROSS THE COASTAL HIGHWAY AND INTO THE SEA. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE PRESS AGENCY "MARKAZIA" RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR THE BOMB HAS BEEN CLAIMED BY A GROUP CALLING ITSELF </p><p>"THE RED HAND - BRIGADE OF SADR." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) DURING THE WEEK ZAHLE HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO </p><p>EARLY MORNING ATTACKS THAT HAVE CAUSED ONLY MATERIAL </p><p>DAMAGE. ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, LF LEADER ELIE </p><p>HOBAYKA AGREED AT A FRIDAY MEETING WITH A LOCAL GREEK </p><p>CATHOLIC DELEGATION  TO CLOSE PHALANGE OFFICES IN THE </p><p>CITY AND TO WITHDRAW LF MILITIAMEN. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) IN OTHER EVENTS THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON AMAL OFFICES </p><p>IN TYRE ON AUGUST 15. LEBANESE STATE TV REPORTED FIRST </p><p>THAT THIS ATTACK HAD BEEN COMMITTED BY HIZBALLAH FORCES </p><p>TO PROTEST AMAL RESTRICTIONS ON HIZBALLAH ACTIVITIES IN </p><p>THE SOUTH AND THEN SUGGESTED THAT THE FIRE COULD HAVE </p><p>COME FROM A ISRAELI PATROL VESSEL. ON AUGUST 17 THERE </p><p>WAS A CLASH USING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND RPG\'S BETWEEN </p><p>AMAL AND PLO FORCES OUTSIDE THE SABRA CAMP. PALESTINIANS </p><p>CLAIMED THAT AMAL WAS HOLDING MOUSTAPHA DIAB, AKA </p><p>ABOUL FATEH, HEAD OF THE ARAFAT FORCES IN LEBANON. AN </p><p>AUTHORIZED AMAL SPOKESMAN SAID THAT AMAL WAS NOT NOW </p><p>HOLDING ANY PALESTINIANS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) THE WEEK ALSO FAILED TO REGISTER ANY FORWARD </p><p>PROGRESS IN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS. IN FACT AFTER THE </p><p>ANTILYAS CAR BOMB PRIME MINISTER KARAME WAS QUOTED AS </p><p>SAYING HE "DIDN\'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, WHETHER TO RESIGN OR </p><p>TO CONTINUE ON." SHIITE CABINET MINISTERS USAYRAN AND </p><p>BARRI, AFTER ANNOUNCING THAT THEY WOULD ATTEND A MEETING </p><p>OF MUSLIM CABINET MINISTERS ON AUGUST 19, STATED THAT </p><p>"IT IS TIME THAT THE SECURITY CONDITION IMPROVES AND THAT </p><p>SYRIA CONTRIBUTES TO AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE GROUND." FOR </p><p>ITS PART THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE LF ISSUED A </p><p>STATEMENT "PROMISING  TO TAKE REVENGE FOR INNOCENT </p><p>VICTIMS AND TO UNDERTAKE A RESPONSE AT A LEVEL COMMEN- </p><p>SURATE WITH THE CRIME." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT. LAST WEEK\'S EVENTS HAD NO POSITIVE ASPECT. </p><p>LITTLE IS EXPECTED TO COME FROM TODAY\'S MEETING OF </p><p>MUSLIM CABINET MINISTERS, FROM WHICH THE TRAVELING </p><p>WALID JUMBLATT WILL BE ABSENT. ON THE CHRISTIAN SIDE </p><p>CONSULTATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN PREPARATION </p><p>FOR FRANJIYYAH\'S RELEASE ON SEPT. 1 OF HIS PROPOSALS </p><p>FOR REFORM. ON THE SECURITY FRONT THERE ARE TOO MANY </p><p>FLASHPOINTS - ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER STRIP, NEAR THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAMPS, ALONG THE GREEN LINE, IN ZAHLE OR </p><p>IN TRIPOLI, TO PREDICT A QUIET WEEK AHEAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
