<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001964 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/EX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S EX-PRIME MINISTER DISCUSSES HIS OUSTER BY </p><p>THE KING </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1932 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION ROBERT BOGGS. REASONS: 1.5 (B an </p><p>d D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  IN A MEETING ON OCTOBER 7 WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR, SHER BAHADUR DEUBA DESCRIBED THE CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>SURROUNDING HIS OCTOBER 4 DISMISSAL AS PRIME MINISTER BY KING </p><p>GYANENDRA.  CLEARLY STUNG BY THE KING\'S PUBLIC CRITICISM OF </p><p>HIS COMPETENCE, DEUBA SAID THAT HE HAD REJECTED ON </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS THE KING\'S REPEATED REQUESTS THAT HE </p><p>RESIGN.  PORTRAYING HIMSELF AS THE HAPLESS VICTIM OF BAD </p><p>ADVICE REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF NATIONAL ELECTIONS IN </p><p>NOVEMBER, DEUBA INDICATED THAT HIS NEPALI CONGRESS </p><p>(DEMOCRATIC) PARTY WOULD NOT JOIN A NEW GOVERNMENT APPOINTED </p><p>BY THE KING, BUT WOULD NOT CARRY HIS GRIEVANCES WITH </p><p>GYANENDRA TO THE STREETS.  SINCE THIS MEETING, DEUBA SEEMS TO </p><p>BE HEWING TO THE COURSE RECOMMENDED BY THE AMBASSADOR OF </p><p>DEDICATING HIMSELF TO STRENGTHENING HIS PARTY AND PREPARING </p><p>HIMSELF TO CONTEST THE NEXT ELECTIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST BY THE AMBASSADOR FOR A </p><p>MEETING WITH HIM, EX-PRIME MINISTER SHER BAHADUR DEUBA </p><p>APPEARED AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE AND SPENT AN HOUR </p><p>DESCRIBING THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO THE DISMISSAL OF HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT ON OCTOBER 4 BY KING GYANENDRA (REFTEL).  DEUBA </p><p>WAS CLEARLY AGITATED AND DEFENSIVE.  THE KING, DEUBA </p><p>EXPLAINED, WAS WORRIED ABOUT TALK OF A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY </p><p>THAT MIGHT REVISE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS MAKING THE ROYAL </p><p>NEPAL ARMY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE MONARCH.  HAVING DECIDED TO GET </p><p>RID OF THE DEUBA GOVERNMENT, THE KING TWICE, ON OCTOBER 1 AND </p><p>3, PRESSED THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN.  DEUBA SAID HE HAD </p><p>REFUSED TO DO SO "ON PRINCIPLE," ARGUING THAT THE KING HAD NO </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO DISMISS A PRIME MINISTER WITHOUT </p><p>THE SUPPORT OF THE PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) REGARDING THE KING\'S PUBLIC CHARGES THAT HE WAS </p><p>"INCOMPETENT" TO HOLD CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTIONS ON TIME, THE EX-PRIME MINISTER INSISTED THAT THE </p><p>KING HAD NO LEGITIMATE BASIS FOR SUCH A CHARGE.  IT WAS </p><p>NEPAL\'S SECURITY OFFICIALS WHO HAD ASSURED HIM INITIALLY, HE </p><p>EXPLAINED, THAT ELECTIONS WOULD BE FEASIBLE IN MID-NOVEMBER </p><p>DESPITE THE MAOIST INSURGENCY.  ONLY RECENTLY HAD THOSE SAME </p><p>OFFICIALS INFORMED HIM THAT SUCH ELECTIONS WOULD BE </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE.  IT WAS THE LEADERS OF THE OTHER LARGE PARTIES, </p><p>FURTHERMORE, WHO PERSUADED HIM ON OCT 3 THAT HE SHOULD </p><p>RECOMMEND TO THE KING THAT THE ELECTIONS BE POSTPONED. </p><p>CHANGING CONDITIONS AND CHANGING COUNSEL HAD REQUIRED HIM TO </p><p>CHANGE HIS POLICY.  DEUBA ATTRIBUTED GYANENDRA\'S CRITICISM OF </p><p>HIM TO THE KING\'S PIQUE THAT HE WOULD NOT RESIGN. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DURING HIS MEETING WITH THE KING RECOMMENDING A </p><p>POSTPONEMENT OF ELECTIONS, DEUBA SAID, HE HAD OFFERED TO FIRE </p><p>CORRUPT MINISTERS IN HIS CABINET AND REPLACE THEM WITH </p><p>TECHNOCRATS OR OTHER PERSONS RECOMMENDED BY THE KING. </p><p>INSTEAD, THE KING HAD PRESSED DEUBA AGAIN TO RESIGN, </p><p>PROMISING TO APPOINT DEUBA AS PRIME MINISTER AGAIN AFTER HIS </p><p>RESIGNATION.  THE KING\'S SUBSEQUENT DISMISSAL OF HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROVED, DEUBA ARGUED, THAT THE KING HARBORED OTHER </p><p>MOTIVES ALL ALONG AND HAD ALREADY DECIDED TO ASSERT MORE </p><p>DIRECT CONTROL.  PALACE INSIDERS TELL HIM, DEUBA SAID, THAT </p><p>THE KING IS VERY AMBITIOUS.  DEUBA SUSPECTED THAT THE KING </p><p>INTENDED TO APPOINT AND DISMISS SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS ON </p><p>SPURIOUS GROUNDS FOR 4-5 YEARS, THUS POSTPONING ELECTIONS AND </p><p>THE RETURN OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT.  DEUBA SAID THAT IN THE </p><p>PAST HE HAD WANTED TO BRING NEW FACES INTO HIS GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>HAD ASKED THE KING FOR HELP IN GATHERING EVIDENCE OF </p><p>CORRUPTION AMONG HIS MINISTERS.  RATHER THAN ASSIST HIM IN </p><p>THIS, HOWEVER, THE KING CONTINUED TO MEET WITH CORRUPT </p><p>MINISTERS.  AFTER ALL, DEUBA ALLEGED, THE KING HAD BEEN A </p><p>CORRUPT BUSINESSMAN HIMSELF BEFORE HIS ACCESSION TO THE </p><p>THRONE.  DEUBA SAID HE DID "NOT MIND" THE CURRENT HOUSE </p><p>ARREST OF SEVERAL FORMER MINISTERS IN HIS GOVERNMENT ON </p><p>SUSPICION OF CORRUPTION AND "WOULD BE RELIEVED" IF THEY </p><p>ACTUALLY WERE INDICTED.  HE DID NOT SEEM TO TAKE THIS </p><p>POSSIBILITY TOO SERIOUSLY, HOWEVER, POINTING OUT THAT MANY OF </p><p>THE MEN UNDER SUSPICION HAVE CLOSE CONTACTS INSIDE THE PALACE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE QUESTION OF THE RANGE OF </p><p>CONSULTATIONS THE KING HAD HAD WITH FOREIGN DIPLOMATS BEFORE </p><p>DISSOLVING PARLIAMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN TOLD BY A </p><p>WELL-PLACED PALACE OFFICIAL THAT THE KING HAD CONVOKED THE US </p><p>AND CHINESE AMBASSADORS ON OCTOBER 4, BUT NOT THE INDIAN. </p><p>DEUBA SAID HE WAS SURE THAT THE PALACE HAD CONSULTED WITH THE </p><p>INDIAN GOVERNMENT THROUGH TWO PERSONAL EMMISSARIES HE HAD </p><p>SENT TO NEW DELHI (REPORTEDLY A FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL OF </p><p>POLICE, AND THE KING\'S BUSINESS PARTNER AND CONFIDANT </p><p>PRABAKAR RANA) AS WELL AS COMMUNICATING THROUGH TWO RETIRED </p><p>INDIAN DIPLOMATS (FORMER FOREIGN SECRETARY RASGOTRA, AND </p><p>FORMER AMBASSADOR TO NEPAL RAJAN) WHEN THE LATTER TWO VISITED </p><p>KATHMANDU IN SEPTEMBER.  DEUBA CONTENDED THAT THE PRICE THE </p><p>KING WAS PAYING FOR INDIAN SUPPORT FOR HIS ACTIONS WAS </p><p>INCREASED GOI INFLUENCE IN NEPAL.  A RECENT, UNPRECEDENTED </p><p>PROTEST DEMONSTRATION STAGED OUTSIDE THE PAKISTAN EMBASSY IN </p><p>KATHMANDU BY NEPALI REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SHIV SENA AND THE </p><p>PASHUPATINATH TEMPLE IN KATHMANDU WAS CLEARLY MOTIVATED FROM </p><p>INDIA AND WAS PROOF OF GROWING INDIAN INFLUENCE HERE, DEUBA </p><p>SAID.  (THE NEW PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SUBSEQUENTLY TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE DEMONSTRATION WAS A PROTEST AGAINST RECENT ATTACKS </p><p>ON A HINDU TEMPLE IN GUJARAT.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE KING, LIKE THE MAOISTS, HAD BETRAYED HIM, DEUBA </p><p>ASSERTED.  THE KING HAD NO LEGAL RIGHT TO SACK HIM, AND DEUBA </p><p>HAD NO INTENTION OF PROPOSING NAMES FOR THE NEW CABINET OR OF </p><p>ALLOWING HIS PARTY MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN IT.  HIS </p><p>PRINCIPAL GOAL WAS TO BE RE-ELECTED AS PRIME MINISTER.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ENCOURAGED DEUBA TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD AND REACT </p><p>POSITIVELY TO THE NEW POLITICAL SITUATION.  THE FORMER PRIME </p><p>MINISTER SHOULD FOCUS HIS ENERGIES PRIMARILY ON STRENGTHENING </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION OF HIS PARTY AND TAKING HIS PROGRAM TO THE </p><p>PEOPLE.  THE AMBASSADOR REMINDED DEUBA OF HIS IMPORTANT </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS AS PRIME MINISTER.  HE HAD BEEN WELL RECEIVED IN </p><p>WASHINGTON, HAD INCREASED INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE </p><p>MAOIST THREAT, AND SECURED UNPRECEDENTED SECURITY ASSISTANCE. </p><p> AS PRIME MINISTER HE HAD ALSO PASSED LEGISLATION SUPPORTING </p><p>POLICIES OF ANTI-CORRUPTION, WOMEN\'S RIGHTS, AND </p><p>ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS.  DEUBA AGREED; HE WOULD </p><p>CONCENTRATE ON REORGANIZING HIS PARTY AND WOULD NOT TAKE IT </p><p>ONTO THE STREETS TO PROTEST THE KING\'S ACTIONS.  HE EXPRESSED </p><p>SOME CONCERN, HOWEVER, BY WHAT HE PERCEIVED AS INITIAL </p><p>EFFORTS BY THE PALACE TO STIFLE FREE EXPRESSION.  WHETHER OR </p><p>NOT HE SUCCEEDED IN HIS ATTEMPTS TO REGAIN THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTERSHIP, HE ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR, HE WOULD REMAIN A </p><p>TRUE FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT. DEUBA CLEARLY WAS BITTER ABOUT HIS UNEXPECTED </p><p>SACKING BY THE KING, AND HIS SELF-SERVING ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>MONARCH\'S MOTIVES AND OBJECTIVES SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AT FACE </p><p>VALUE.  DESPITE THIS, HOWEVER, HE APPARENTLY HAS TAKEN THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S ADVICE AND MAINTAINED A RELATIVELY DIGNIFIED AND </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE PUBLIC STANCE.  THE EX-PRIME MINISTER MET WITH </p><p>THE KING THE DAY AFTER HIS MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR. </p><p>AFTER THE MEETING HE ANNOUNCED TO THE PRESS THAT HIS PARTY </p><p>WOULD NOT JOIN ANY COUNCIL OF MINISTERS APPOINTED BY THE KING </p><p>AND CONTINUED TO INSIST THAT THE OUSTER OF HIS GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>UNCONSTIUTIONAL. PARTY INSIDERS TELL US, HOWEVER, THAT DEUBA </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THAT HE MUST BE REALISTIC IN REACTING TO THE NEW </p><p>POLITICAL SITUATION AND HAS BEGUN TO TURN HIS ATTENTION TO </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL WORK WITHIN THE PARTY. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
