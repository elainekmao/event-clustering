<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000243 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PREL, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: ROYG RAID NETS EXTREMIST SUSPECT MOHAMMED ALI </p><p>AL-ZAIDI </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political/Economic Officer Willeah E. Cato for Reasons 1 </p><p>.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Begin summary:  On Wednesday, January 29th, Yemeni </p><p>security forces arrested Mohammed Ali Al-Zaidi, a suspect in </p><p>both the July 27, 2001 kidnapping of German diplomat Rainer </p><p>Berns and attacks on government institutions in the Marib </p><p>governorate.  Al-Zaidi was wounded during a gunfight with </p><p>security forces prior to his arrest and is currently under </p><p>guard at a medical clinic in Marib.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On January 29th Yemeni security forces apprehended </p><p>Mohammed Ali Al-Zaidi, after a shoot-out in which a Yemeni </p><p>soldier was killed, another wounded, and both Al-Zaidi and a </p><p>relative, Ghalib Abdullah Al-Zaidi, were wounded. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Al-Zaidi is currently receiving medical treatment at </p><p>Al-Wasit clinic in Marib under the guard of Yemeni security </p><p>forces, but, according to the media, the situation on the </p><p>ground remains "very tense".  Reportedly, both the tribes of </p><p>Jiham and Murad refuse to allow Yemeni authorities to take </p><p>Al-Zaidi out of Marib, and have threatened to fire on the </p><p>soldiers if they try to take him by force. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment:  Al-Zaidi is described by numerous </p><p>publications as a dangerous individual, who has spent time in </p><p>Afghanistan and organized meetings for extremists. Yemeni </p><p>security officials and a senior staffer for President Saleh </p><p>have contacted the Embassy to draw attention to the Zaidi </p><p>operation as a significant counter-terrorism success.  An </p><p>advisor to Saleh told the DCM that Mohammed Ali Zaidi was </p><p>considered "one of the most dangerous al-Qaeda elements left </p><p>in Yemen."  The German Embassy also called to clarify </p><p>Al-Zaidi\'s position on our most wanted list, and to ask about </p><p>his background.  Al-Zaidi was not, and is not, on any list of </p><p>individuals wanted by U.S. authorities as far as post is </p><p>aware.  Information available at post indicates Zaidi has had </p><p>contacts with known al-Qaeda figures, but does not confirm </p><p>that he himself had been an al-Qaeda operative. </p><p>Nevertheless, the successful Yemeni raid is an important </p><p>security success, and signals ROYG resolve to act against </p><p>extremists.  End comment. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
