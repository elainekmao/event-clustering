<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000098 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2013 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00098  101524Z </p><p>TAGS: KPKO, MARR, PREL, IS, LE, SY, IT, UNIFIL, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY ON UNIFIL MANDATE RENEWAL NOTICE: WANT OUT </p><p>BUT CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 5402 </p><p>     B. 02 ROME 3379 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE GOI WILL NOT OPPOSE THE RENEWAL OF THE </p><p>UNIFIL\'S MANDATE THAT EXPIRES ON JAN 31, 2003.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE GOI IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING </p><p>GRADUALLY REDUCING ITS FORCES IN UNIFIL, EVENTUALLY </p><p>WITHDRAWING COMPLETELY FROM UNIFIL, AND RE-DEPLOYING ITS </p><p>FORCES TO THE MFO OR ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION.  THE GOI IS, </p><p>HOWEVER, MOST CONCERNED ABOUT DAMAGING ITS RAPPORT WITH </p><p>LEBANON AND POTENTIALLY LOSING LEBANESE SUPPORT FOR AN </p><p>ITALIAN CANDIDACY FOR THE UNSC IN 2007-08.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON JAN 9, NEA WATCHER MET WITH LUCA FRATINI, THE MFA\'S </p><p>DEPUTY OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR THE EASTERN MED, TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>FUTURE OF UNIFIL.  FRATINI FIRST EXPLAINED ITALY\'S HISTORY </p><p>AND COMMITMENT TO UNIFIL: ITALY HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF UNIFIL </p><p>SINCE 1978 AND, DESPITE THE REDUCTION IN FORCES FROM 5,000 TO </p><p>2,000 AND THE REDUCTION IN PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES FROM </p><p>FIFTEEN TO SEVEN AFTER ISRAEL\'S WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTHERN </p><p>LEBANON IN MAY 2000, ITALY STILL MAINTAINS A CONTINGENT OF </p><p>FOUR HELICOPTERS AND 52 MEN IN UNIFIL. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AS ONE OF THE "SURVIVOR" CONTINGENTS IN UNIFIL, THE </p><p>OVER-EXTENDED ITALIAN MILITARY IS PAYING THE PRICE FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00098  101524Z </p><p>LEBANON\'S FAILURE TO FULLY HONOR UN SECURITY RESOLUTIONS, </p><p>GIVEN THAT THE LEBANESE ARMED FORCES TURNED OVER SOUTHERN </p><p>LEBANON TO HIZBALLAH, COMPLAINED FRATINI.  HOWEVER, THE GOI </p><p>WILL NOT OPPOSE THE RENEWAL OF THE UNIFIL MANDATE THAT </p><p>EXPIRES ON JAN. 31, NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE GOI DOES NOT </p><p>QUESTION THE USEFULNESS OF UNIFIL, BUT ALSO BECAUSE TIME IS </p><p>RUNNING OUT TO OPPOSE THE RENEWAL THIS MONTH, EXPLAINED </p><p>FRATINI. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THIS SAID, THE MFA IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING GRADUALLY </p><p>REDUCING ITS FORCES IN UNIFIL AND EVENTUALLY WITHDRAWING FROM </p><p>UNIFIL ALTOGETHER, ADDED FRATINI.  THE FINAL DECISION ON </p><p>ITALY\'S FUTURE CONTRIBUTION TO UNIFIL WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE </p><p>BY THE MOD, BUT FM FRATTINI IS STUDYING THE POLITICAL ANGLE </p><p>OF THE ISSUE.  THE MFA IS CURRENTLY STUDYING WHETHER IT WOULD </p><p>NOT BE BETTER TO DEPLOY THE SAME FORCES TO THE MFO OR </p><p>POTENTIALLY IN THE FUTURE TO A THIRD PARTY MONITORING </p><p>MECHANISM (IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN ROAD </p><p>MAP.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) HOWEVER, THE GOI IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEGATIVE </p><p>IMPLICATION THAT WITHDRAWING FROM UNIFIL COULD HAVE ON ITS </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOI DOES NOT </p><p>WANT TO LOSE LEBANON\'S SUPPORT FOR THE ITALIAN CANDIDACY TO </p><p>THE UNSC IN 2007-08, AND THUS IS STUDYING CAREFULLY THE </p><p>TIMING OF ANY DECISION IT MAKES ON THE FUTURE OF UNIFIL, </p><p>UNDERLINED FRATINI.  ITALY SHOULD EITHER NOT WITHDRAW AT ALL </p><p>FROM UNIFIL OR WITHDRAW SOON, LONG BEFORE THE 2007 DATE, </p><p>HOPING TO ENSURE LEBANON\'S SUPPORT FOR THE ITALIAN UNSC </p><p>CANDIDACY, EXPLAINED FRATINI. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00098  101524Z </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS AGO (REF B) WHEN THE </p><p>MFA\'S POSITION ON UNIFIL WAS "REDUCE IT, BUT DON\'T DISMANTLE </p><p>IT," THE ABOVE IS A CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN POSITION.  EMBASSY </p><p>WILL FOLLOW THE MFA\'S POLITICAL DECISION ON ITALY\'S FUTURE </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN UNIFIL. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00098 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
