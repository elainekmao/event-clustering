WFP HOSTED A TWO-AND-ONE-HALF DAY CONSULTATION ON </p><p>EMERGENCY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS (ENA) AT CASTEL GANDOLFO (NEAR </p><p>ROME) MARCH 12-14, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF EIGHT DONORS, </p><p>FIVE UN AGENCIES, NINE NGOS, USAID\'S FAMINE EARLY WARNING </p><p>SYSTEM NETWORK (FEWS NET), AND TWO PROMINENT REGIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS FROM SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (CILSS AND SADC).

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE HAS </p><p>TOTALED AROUND U.S. DOLLARS 5.5 BILLION/ANNUM. WORLDWIDE, 35 </p><p>MILLION PEOPLE HAVE FLED THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF FEAR OF </p><p>PERSECUTION OR WAR. THIS YEAR WFP EMERGENCY OPERATIONS </p><p>(EMOPS) WILL TARGET (EXCLUDING IRAQ) 39.2 MILLION </p><p>BENEFICIARIES, AND WILL REQUIRE AN INPUT OF ALMOST 2.4 </p><p>MILLION TONS. PROJECTED REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTRACTED RELIEF </p><p>AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS (PRROS) WILL INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01511  01 OF 04  091003Z </p><p>TARGETING 25 MILLION BENEFICIARIES WITH UP TO 1.6 MILLION </p><p>TONS FOR 2003. WFP, AND BY EXTENSION THE OTHER UN </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ACTORS, NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR </p><p>EMERGENCY ASSESSMENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY CREDIBLE SO THAT ALL </p><p>DONORS ABLE TO RESPOND WILL BE WILLING TO RESPOND. IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, THE UN AGENCIES NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT RIGOR </p><p>IS SYSTEMATICALLY APPLIED TO THE APPEALS PROCESS IN ORDER TO </p><p>AVOID "INFLATING THE NUMBERS."  THERE IS A GENERAL DONOR </p><p>BIAS (LED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION) THAT FOOD AID </p><p>REQUIREMENTS FOR EMERGENCIES ARE INVARIABLY OVER-ESTIMATED </p><p>WHICH, IF THE APPEALS ARE MET, COULD IMPACT NEGATIVELY ON </p><p>LOCAL MARKETS. IT WAS NOTED THAT BECAUSE WFP EMERGENCY </p><p>OPERATIONS (EMOPS) IN THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE FREQUENTLY </p><p>BEEN MET WITH A 50-70 PERCENT RESPONSE, THERE APPEARS TO BE </p><p>A TENDENCY TO SHOOT HIGH IN THE ENAS TO COMPENSATE.

THE INITIATIVE TAKEN BY FAO/GLOBAL INFORMATION AND EARLY </p><p>WARNING SYSTEM (GIEWS) TO WORK WITH WFP IN OPENING UP </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY ASSESSMENTS IS </p><p>VERY WELCOME. IN THIS REGARD, THE UNITED STATES STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF FAO AND WFP ENGAGING DONORS WHEN EARLY SIGNS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01511  03 OF 04  091004Z </p><p>OF A POTENTIAL CRISIS ARISE. IN THIS WAY DONORS CAN DIRECTLY </p><p>RAISE ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THEM RELATED TO METHODOLOGY, </p><p>TIMING, PARTICIPATION IN ASSESSMENTS, ETC. IT WAS SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT ONE PRACTICAL WAY TO OVERCOME THE PERCEPTION OF FOOD </p><p>AID BIAS, AND POSSIBLE HARM TO LOCAL MARKETS, WAS TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT NEEDS ANALYSES ADEQUATELY REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS </p><p>AFFECTING BOTH THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR FOOD BY VULNERABLE </p><p>GROUPS. IN SHORT, CONTINGENCY PLANNING INVOLVING ALL </p><p>RELEVANT IN-COUNTRY ACTORS WILL LEAD TO EARLIER CONSENSUS </p><p>ABOUT ACTIONS REQUIRED IN RESPONSE TO NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN </p><p>THE ENA. AS SUCH, FEWS NET CONTINUES TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT </p><p>ROLE IN FACILITATING ASSESSMENT PLANNING AND IN ASSISTING </p><p>CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY ASSESSMENT MISSIONS (CFSAMS) IN THOSE </p><p>COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS A REPRESENTATIVE IN COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>6. WHERE FOOD AID IS APPROPRIATE, INTERVENTIONS NEED TO TAKE </p><p>INTO ACCOUNT SUPPLIES OF FOOD THROUGH LOCAL MARKETS </p><p>(EXISTING PRIVATE SECTOR SYSTEMS) AND THROUGH FOSTERING </p><p>INCREASED PURCHASING POWER WHEREVER FEASIBLE. USING MARKETS </p><p>TO DELIVER RELIEF ASSISTANCE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SELF- </p><p>SUFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY. ASSESSMENTS NEED TO CONSIDER </p><p>WAYS OF IMPROVING THE NATIONAL CAPACITY (CONTINGENCY AND </p><p>RESPONSE PLANNING) TO IMPORT FOOD ON TIME AND GET IT TO </p><p>WHERE IT IS NEEDED. MOREOVER, A FOCUS ON THE NEED TO QUICKLY </p><p>RESTORE LOCAL MARKETS TO NORMALITY NEEDS TO BE A CRITICAL </p><p>COMPONENT OF ANY EMERGENCY NEEDS ANALYSIS. </p><p> </p><p>7. PRE AND POST SEASON TECHNICAL FORA, WHICH ALREADY EXIST </p><p>IN SOME COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, PROVIDE FOR A VERY USEFUL </p><p>PROCESS FOR PLANNING JOINT ASSESSMENTS AND FOR EARLY </p><p>AGREEMENT ON PARTICIPATION AND METHODOLOGICAL ELEMENTS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01511  03 OF 04  091004Z </p><p> </p><p>8.

THE GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN A CMR OF </p><p>LESS THAN 1 PER 10,000 PER DAY AND LESS THAN 2 PER 10,000 </p><p>PER DAY IN THE U-5. (THE AVERAGE MORTALITY IN DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES IS 0.5/10,000/DAY.)
