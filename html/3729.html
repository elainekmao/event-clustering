<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001719 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD; </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-16-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CE, TH, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lankan government-Tamil Tiger talks </p><p>kickoff in Thailand on conciliatory note </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-Sa/INS 09-16-02 unclass e-mails </p><p>-      (B) Ops Center/Colombo 09-16-02 telecon </p><p>-      (C) FBIS Reston Va DTG 160520Z Sep 02 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 1693, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  The opening ceremony kicking off talks </p><p>between the GSL and the Tamil Tigers on September 16 was </p><p>constructive, with both sides making conciliatory </p><p>remarks.  The talks, which are being held at a naval </p><p>base in Thailand, are now in closed-door session until a </p><p>closing ceremony and press conference on the afternoon </p><p>of September 18.  Mission continues to hear that this </p><p>initial round of talks will be more of a get-to-know-you </p><p>opportunity than substantive in content.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Mission watched the opening ceremony kicking </p><p>off talks between the Sri Lankan government and </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) beamed live from </p><p>Thailand on local TV on September 16.  In a positive </p><p>note, the opening speeches by GSL and LTTE </p><p>representatives were conciliatory.  Norwegian and Thai </p><p>government representatives also gave brief speeches. </p><p>After the opening ceremony, the two sides entered into </p><p>closed-door face-to-face talks with only Norwegian </p><p>government officials present as facilitators.  The </p><p>closed-door talks are scheduled to continue until </p><p>September 18 when a closing ceremony and press </p><p>conference will be held. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Per Ref A, Mission has e-mailed SA/INS the texts </p><p>of speeches given at the opening ceremony.  Some of the </p><p>highlights of these speeches included the following </p><p>snippets: </p><p> </p><p>-- G.L. Peiris, a senior GSL minister involved in peace </p><p>process issues, stated, in part:  "Our nation has </p><p>resolved, with a firmness of conviction that has served </p><p>us well at the most critical moments in our long and </p><p>eventful history, that a sea change is necessary, now </p><p>that the tempests have abated.  Nothing is as evident in </p><p>all substantial shades of public opinion in our country </p><p>today as the unquenchable thirst for peace, dignity, and </p><p>opportunity for all our people...Despite the color and </p><p>drama of this event, however, it behooves us to remember </p><p>that the unfolding panorama of history represents a </p><p>continuum.  President Kumaratunga, soon after her </p><p>election for the first time eight years ago, committed </p><p>her government to the goal of peace...We stand </p><p>unwaveringly for the amplest degree of devolution and </p><p>for the establishment and strengthening of institutions </p><p>designed to achieve this purpose.  But these reforms </p><p>must necessarily be effected within the framework of a </p><p>state whose unity and territorial integrity is ensured </p><p>in fact and in law by the envisioned structures." </p><p> </p><p>-- Anton Balasingham, the LTTE spokesman, stated, in </p><p>part:  "We (the LTTE) are optimistic that the peace </p><p>talks will succeed because both Mr. Velupillai </p><p>Prabhakaran, the LTTE leader, and Mr. Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, have a </p><p>genuine and firm will and a firm determination to </p><p>resolve the conflict through the process of dialogue. </p><p>As far as the LTTE is concerned, I can assure you that </p><p>we are seriously and sincerely committed to peace and </p><p>that we will strive our utmost to ensure the success of </p><p>the negotiations...Though the leadership of the LTTE </p><p>had, on several occasions, opted for cessation of </p><p>hostilities and peace talks, the previous government </p><p>rejected our conciliatory gestures and intensified the </p><p>conditions of war that caused heavy loss of life and </p><p>monumental destruction of Tamil property...The situation </p><p>has radically changed with the assumption to power of a </p><p>new government with the overwhelming popular mandate for </p><p>peace and negotiated political settlement." </p><p> </p><p>-- Vidar Helgesen, Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister, </p><p>stated, in part:  "The government of Norway feels </p><p>privileged to have the opportunity of facilitating these </p><p>negotiations, thereby assisting the parties in their </p><p>quest for peace.  We feel privileged to witness at close </p><p>range the leadership the parties provide.  Trying to </p><p>bring a long and bitter war to an end through peaceful </p><p>means, they are sending a powerful message to us.  At a </p><p>time when the world is facing a magnitude of armed </p><p>conflicts and violent threats, and at a time when the </p><p>use of armed force is too often predicated as a primary </p><p>means to address such threats, the parties in Sri Lanka </p><p>are setting an example for the world." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  It may be a sign of the success of the </p><p>peace process thus far, but most Sri Lankans seem more </p><p>fixated by the results of a large international cricket </p><p>tournament taking place in Colombo than what is </p><p>transpiring in Thailand.  In any case, sources in </p><p>Colombo have told us that both the GSL and the LTTE are </p><p>satisfied with how the opening ceremony went.  There is </p><p>still no word about the results of this afternoon\'s </p><p>closed-door session.  Mission continues to hear that </p><p>this initial round of talks will be more of a get-to- </p><p>know-you opportunity focusing on assistance-related </p><p>issues than substantive as to the means to attain a </p><p>negotiated settlement.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
