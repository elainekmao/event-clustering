<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HO CHI MINH CITY 000585 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, SOCI, PGOV, PREL, EAID, EINV, KIRF, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: THICH QUANG DO -- HOW FREE AT LAST? </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HCMC 0475    B) HCMC 0412 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  During a June 30 meeting with Consul </p><p>General, recently "released" United Buddhist Church of </p><p>Vietnam (UBCV) deputy Thich Quang Do launched into a two- </p><p>hour plus discourse on religion, democracy, freedom, and </p><p>capitalism.  Confirming press reports, he said he would soon </p><p>attempt to test the limits of his "unconditional release" </p><p>with a visit to UBCV patriarch Thich Huyen Quang in Quy Nhon </p><p>on July 10.  Until then, Thich Quang Do said he would </p><p>continue to receive visitors and monitor his health at the </p><p>same pagoda where he has been detained incommunicado for the </p><p>past two years under "administrative surveillance."  He </p><p>asked ConGenOffs to convey his appreciation for the support </p><p>of the USG, U.S. Congress, the EU, and various international </p><p>human rights organizations over the years and encouraged </p><p>continued outside pressure to bring about democratic change </p><p>in Vietnam.  He predicted the GVN would one day lose control </p><p>over a population that had grown accustomed to the benefits </p><p>of economic reforms.  Citing upcoming medical appointments, </p><p>he expressed regret that he would be unable to attend </p><p>ConGen\'s July 4 reception.  Despite his chronic medical </p><p>problems, Thich Quang Do appeared hale, hearty, and in full </p><p>possession of his faculties.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Consul General and Poloff called on 75-year old </p><p>Thich Quang Do on June 30, at the neat and well kept Thanh </p><p>Minh Zen pagoda in HCMC.  The second highest ranking monk in </p><p>the hierarchy of the outlawed Unified Buddhist Church of </p><p>Vietnam (UBCV), Thich Quang Do had been isolated and </p><p>detained at the pagoda under "administrative surveillance" </p><p>for nearly two years after his June 2001 attempt to "rescue" </p><p>UBCV Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang from conditions resembling </p><p>house arrest at a remote pagoda in Quang Ngai province and </p><p>bring him to HCMC.  The two years of administrative </p><p>surveillance were originally part of a sentence imposed in </p><p>1995 on charges related to organizing unauthorized </p><p>assistance for flood victims in the Mekong Delta.  The </p><p>administrative surveillance portion of the 1995 sentence, </p><p>reinstated in 2001 despite his inclusion in a 1998 general </p><p>amnesty, was lifted ahead of schedule and without advance </p><p>notice on June 26. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  During the private meeting with ConGenOffs, Thich </p><p>Quang Do was lucid and feisty for a man of his age.  He was </p><p>in excellent spirits, considering his recent detention </p><p>(something he attributed to Buddhist control of mind over </p><p>body).  He was extremely animated, although not always </p><p>responsive to the questions asked, and made frequent use of </p><p>proverbs and Buddhist metaphor.  Describing himself as </p><p>"having ears like a rabbit," Thich Quang Do said he needed </p><p>to remain alert to stay one step ahead of the GVN.  He said </p><p>he was surprised when the detention order was lifted ahead </p><p>of schedule, but noted he never understood the government\'s </p><p>reasoning as to why he was supposed to be released from his </p><p>two-year detention in September, rather than June, in the </p><p>first place (ref A).  He compared the GVN\'s actions in </p><p>reinstating the administrative surveillance to those of a </p><p>debt collector who continues to collect long after the debt </p><p>has been paid.  He claimed to have no idea why he was </p><p>released ahead of schedule, but felt it must surely be part </p><p>of some GVN "scheme." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do also dismissed outright the </p><p>grounds for his original imprisonment in 1995, for "damaging </p><p>national solidarity" by organizing relief to flood victims </p><p>outside the GVN-approved Fatherland Front sponsorship via a </p><p>Communist Party mass organization (such as the Women\'s </p><p>Union, or Youth Union).  Noting that various Buddhist groups </p><p>had been encouraged to carry out such charitable activities </p><p>by the former southern regime prior to 1975, he accused the </p><p>Fatherland Front (the umbrella group for mass organizations) </p><p>of having divided people and prolonged the suffering of the </p><p>masses. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  According to Thich Quang Do, the authorities who </p><p>appeared unannounced at the pagoda on June 26 to deliver the </p><p>oral release order were minor district-level officials.  He </p><p>said the GVN was always careful to let local officials </p><p>pretend to take the leading role, in order to protect the </p><p>real decision makers at the central level.  In his view, the </p><p>GVN had sent low-ranking functionaries because they were </p><p>afraid to face responsibility for his unjust imprisonment </p><p>and answer his questions directly.  Because he still noticed </p><p>policemen watching the pagoda, Thich Quang Do was not sure </p><p>what the release order meant. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  For now, Thich Quang Do plans to reside at his </p><p>former "prison pagoda."  He bases his claim to administer </p><p>the pagoda on the sequence of events following the communist </p><p>takeover of the South.  In 1978, after his release from a </p><p>two-year stay in prison for opposing the communist regime, </p><p>the communist authorities had appointed him to run Thanh </p><p>Minh Zen Pagoda in HCMC.  Because his 1982 transfer from </p><p>HCMC to the North for his opposition to the formation of the </p><p>Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS) was accomplished without any </p><p>formal, written order, Thich Quang Do considers the original </p><p>Thanh Minh Zen assignment still valid.  So he therefore </p><p>refuses to file any application for residency, even though </p><p>local officials have already asked him to do so.  ("Why </p><p>should I ask for something back that I never lost to begin </p><p>with?")  The officials with whom he spoke on June 26 said </p><p>they had no authority to decide this matter, but promised to </p><p>convey his points to those who could.  Thich Quang Do also </p><p>plans to apply for a telephone, though he is not optimistic </p><p>about his chances for success.  He noted that during his </p><p>detention, he could not use the single telephone at the </p><p>monastery for fear the police would cut the line and </p><p>inconvenience the Abbot. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Despite his "release," Thich Quang Do is certain </p><p>he will still be "guarded" by security agents at the pagoda </p><p>and followed whenever he ventured outside.  He believes the </p><p>Vietnamese authorities had not interfered with ConGenOffs </p><p>"out of respect" for the ConGen, but would be more </p><p>restrictive with lay believers and other visitors.  Despite </p><p>the continued security presence, some believers had visited </p><p>him over the past few days, including a group of overseas </p><p>Vietnamese (Viet Khieu) living in Australia.  Several </p><p>visitors had been followed home by police and questioned. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do plans to continue receiving </p><p>visitors until July 10, when he hopes to travel to Quy Nhon </p><p>(without GVN "assistance") to confer with UBCV Patriarch </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang on "Buddhist matters."  He noted that </p><p>unlike his religious superior, he now had a written order </p><p>releasing him from detention.  Absent such an order -- </p><p>something the GVN could never issue because it had never </p><p>issued an order to detain him in the first place, and thus </p><p>would then have to admit he had been detained for 21 years </p><p>without legal documentation -- Thich Huyen Quang\'s current </p><p>situation was different.  The GVN could move him around from </p><p>pagoda to pagoda, something Thich Quang Do described as </p><p>"mobile detention." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do said he was suffering from several </p><p>chronic health conditions, including diabetes, high blood </p><p>pressure, and unspecified kidney, heart and eye ailments. </p><p>He was currently on several medications and was scheduled </p><p>for three separate examinations on July 4 -- appointments </p><p>that would unfortunately prevent him from attending ConGen\'s </p><p>Independence Day reception.  According to Thich Quang Do, he </p><p>was able to visit the doctor on a monthly basis during his </p><p>detention by informing local authorities and waiting </p><p>approximately one week for permission, but he refused to </p><p>comply with demands to submit a written request for each </p><p>visit.  He regularly told his "captors" that it would be </p><p>their fault if he died.  A handful of plainclothes security </p><p>officers usually accompanied him to his appointments, </p><p>waiting just outside the doctor\'s office and retrieving </p><p>copies of his medical records for their own files. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Other than his forays out for medical treatment, </p><p>Thich Quang Do said local authorities had basically turned </p><p>his room at the pagoda "into a prison" for the past two </p><p>years.  He was completely isolated from the outside world </p><p>and unaware of the many visitors who had attempted to meet </p><p>with him.  He praised Thanh Minh Zen\'s  Abbot, however, for </p><p>standing up to the authorities and denying them permission </p><p>to place guards outside his actual room in the pagoda. The </p><p>authorities had been forced to back down when the Abbot told </p><p>them the pagoda was not under detention, and if they wanted </p><p>a guard inside, they had better transfer Thich Quang Do to a </p><p>prison.  The security forces then resigned themselves to </p><p>sitting in the outer courtyard of the compound.  Thich Quang </p><p>Do believes that undercover operatives continue to monitor </p><p>the comings and goings of believers, and claimed to have </p><p>noticed a decline in the number of worshippers at the </p><p>pagoda. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Several times during the conversation, Thich </p><p>Quang Do reiterated his Buddhist obligation to "be honest </p><p>and speak the truth."  Disavowing any prejudice against the </p><p>current government (even though he said four family members </p><p>had been "killed by the communists"), he claimed to express </p><p>the feelings of ordinary Vietnamese, who confided in monks </p><p>and priests, but were otherwise afraid to speak out. </p><p>Offering his views on the current government, he observed </p><p>that all power still resides with the Communist Party of </p><p>Vietnam (CPV) at the central level.  Any pretense of </p><p>authority outside Hanoi was intended only to insulate the </p><p>GVN and give it plausible deniability.  While they had no </p><p>real authority, corrupt local officials abused their power </p><p>for economic gain, and citizens were powerless to complain. </p><p>If the CPV truly intended to fight official corruption, </p><p>there would be nobody left to fill the government ranks. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  Drawing on discussions with Thich Huyen Quang </p><p>after the patriarch\'s meetings in Hanoi (ref B), Thich Quang </p><p>Do noted that Prime Minister Phan Van Khai had accused local </p><p>officials of "mistakenly" reinstating his original 1995 </p><p>detention order.  This was just another example of Hanoi\'s </p><p>"good cop/bad cop" routine -- let the local authorities take </p><p>the rap for implementing a central GVN decision, but then </p><p>have the central GVN come in after the fact and "correct" </p><p>the local authorities\' mistakes. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Echoing what we have heard from other ranking </p><p>UBCV monks, Thich Quang Do claimed that all Vietnam Buddhist </p><p>Sangha (VBS) monks were merely UBCV monks who had succumbed </p><p>to GVN pressure.  He dated CPV attempts to discredit the </p><p>UBCV back to the formation of the first "Patriotic Buddhist </p><p>Association" in 1975. ("The title itself means there must be </p><p>traitors somewhere.")  Under the circumstances, he found it </p><p>ironic that he and his colleagues in the UBCV were accused </p><p>of destroying national solidarity, noting that even in 1975, </p><p>"CPV strategy had been to divide and conquer."  Labeling all </p><p>of Vietnam\'s rulers since the time of Emperor Bao Dai as </p><p>dictators, Thich Quang Do described the CPV as the most </p><p>sophisticated in the way it has sown fear and distrust among </p><p>families and communities, and thus effected control.  In </p><p>that same manner, the CPV had tried to use Buddhist monks to </p><p>destroy Buddhism, but Buddhism could not be separated from </p><p>the Vietnamese nation and people.  Although Thich Quang Do </p><p>criticized the new generation of monks as "working for the </p><p>government," he predicted that Vietnam\'s Buddhists would </p><p>soon overcome their "spiritual restrictions," and that </p><p>Buddhism would flourish again through the support of its </p><p>believers, including those from overseas. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Toward the end of the meeting, Thich Quang Do </p><p>offered his personal goals for the future.  An oft-repeated </p><p>theme throughout the two-and-a-half hour conversation was </p><p>that freedom and democracy were the most important elements </p><p>for national development.  Freedom was what made the U.S. a </p><p>superpower.  Along with promoting freedom and democracy, </p><p>Thich Quang Do said he wished to re-establish "normal </p><p>activities" for the UBCV.  He also expressed concern that </p><p>Vietnamese students had been sent to Russia and China to </p><p>study science and technical subjects, but the humanities and </p><p>philosophy were ignored.  While he termed the establishment </p><p>of a multiparty system "a must", he said "nobody dares to </p><p>raise this subject." </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do was aware of the recent arrest or </p><p>Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, and the trials of Pham Hong Son and Tran </p><p>Khue.  He said they showed the GVN\'s continuing fear of </p><p>independent thought.  He pointed out the contradiction </p><p>between the relatively light sentences accorded GVN and CPV </p><p>officials implicated on corruption charges in the recent Nam </p><p>Cam case, and the much stiffer sentence imposed on Pham Hong </p><p>Son for receiving US$150 for translating a document on the </p><p>Internet.  Without democracy, there was no chance for </p><p>improved human rights in Vietnam.  A free press was the best </p><p>way to keep citizens informed of deficiencies in their </p><p>government, and draw attention to the large gap between the </p><p>written laws of Vietnam and the reality of their </p><p>enforcement. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU)  More generally, now that the Vietnamese people </p><p>had tasted relative prosperity and reform, things could not </p><p>go back to the way they were before.  According to Thich </p><p>Quang Do, "Once a person knows how it feels to ride a </p><p>motorcycle, they will not go back to a bicycle."  While the </p><p>GVN would prefer to open up the system only to the level at </p><p>which it could still maintain power, someday it would lose </p><p>control.  Thich Quang Do believes that many top leaders have </p><p>already lost faith in Marxism-Leninism themselves, and that </p><p>nearly everyone was now a capitalist at heart.  This would </p><p>be the driving force for the eventual collapse of the CPV </p><p>and GVN.  But if Vietnam were a democracy now, it would not </p><p>be communist ruled. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do ended the meeting by asking the </p><p>Consul General to again convey thanks to his many supporters </p><p>in the U.S. Congress (including Representative Loretta </p><p>Sanchez, whom he met twice), EU nations, and international </p><p>human rights organizations (especially Human Rights Watch). </p><p>While he specifically said he was not calling for direct </p><p>intervention from outside, he asked that international aid </p><p>donors and foreign investors "develop human rights and </p><p>freedom too, not just the economy."  He urged that </p><p>development aid be somehow linked to progress in human </p><p>rights.  To simply pour money into various aid projects </p><p>would only give the GVN greater financial means for control </p><p>and further enrich corrupt officials. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU)  Comment:  Thich Quang Do seems to have emerged </p><p>from his two years of isolation as outspoken and feisty as </p><p>ever.  Ready to challenge the GVN at every turn and unlikely </p><p>to back down, he presents an interesting counterweight to </p><p>Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang\'s more measured, modest </p><p>approach.  Thich Quang Do\'s health remains a concern, </p><p>however, and may mean that for all of his big picture </p><p>criticism of the GVN and discussion of democracy, he may </p><p>have to limit himself to a more immediate concern: finding </p><p>some way to legalize the UBCV\'s status.  Whether the UBCV </p><p>leadership is able to take advantage of this small window of </p><p>opportunity to revitalize their church will depend a great </p><p>deal on how provocative the GVN finds their actions in the </p><p>coming weeks and months.  Thich Huyen Quang has maintained a </p><p>low profile in Quy Nhon, but Thich Quang Do has generally </p><p>been more of a firebrand.  Notably, Thich Quang Do skirted </p><p>around any questions about reconciliation or merging with </p><p>the VBS.  It is clear that the UBCV leadership believes it </p><p>has benefited greatly from international pressure and hopes </p><p>to continue to receive more targeted, focused support in the </p><p>future.  The question is, will it use this pressure and </p><p>support to push too far too quickly, or will it proceed step- </p><p>by-step? </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
