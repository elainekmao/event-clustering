<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 001274 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, BM, JP </p><p>SUBJECT: JAPANESE AMBASSADOR RAISES POLITICAL TRANSITION </p><p>AND ECONOMIC REFORM WITH THAN SHWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: TOKYO 5480 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Japanese Ambassador Yuji Miyamoto delivered a </p><p>message from Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi when he </p><p>presented his credentials to Than Shwe on September 16. </p><p>According to sources at the Japanese Embassy, Miyamoto also </p><p>went into some detail about political transition, Japanese </p><p>aid, and economic reform in Burma. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Japanese Aid: Koizumi\'s letter made three points.  It </p><p>reaffirmed the historic friendship between Japan and Burma; </p><p>it emphasized the importance of motion towards democracy; and </p><p>it reiterated Foreign Minister Kawaguchi\'s offer to give </p><p>special consideration to any aid projects that were agreed </p><p>between the NLD and the government.  According to Koizumi\'s </p><p>letter, such projects would be handled "outside normal </p><p>channels," meaning that they would be approved and funded at </p><p>no cost to Japan\'s normal aid budget in Burma.  Such projects </p><p>would be, according to the letter, a pure bonus for the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Economic Reform: The Ambassador, on his own, raised </p><p>economic reform issues.  He noted that Japan was finalizing </p><p>its report on Structural Adjustment in Burma and asked Than </p><p>Shwe to consider reading it in full.  Than Shwe simply nodded </p><p>at that suggestion. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Political Transition: Than Shwe told the Ambassador </p><p>that the GOB was committed to democratization.  However, he </p><p>made no promises regarding the pace or timetable for change. </p><p>Rather, he emphasized that national unity, education, and </p><p>economic development had to come before democracy.  Burma had </p><p>failed in the past, he argued, because it had not been ready </p><p>for western-style democracy.  He wanted to be sure this time </p><p>that it did not fail again. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: Miyamoto made good use of his time with Than </p><p>Shwe, delivering messages that need to get through, but which </p><p>rarely reach Than Shwe.  The Japanese have also obviously </p><p>done some thinking about the best way to encourage </p><p>cooperation between the government and the NLD.  Hence, the </p><p>offer of aid on basically no-cost terms. End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
