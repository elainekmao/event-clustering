<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003081 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF: PDAS BELLAMY AND DAS PERRY </p><p>AF/W FOR BOOTH </p><p>AF/RA FOR BITTRICK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/06/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OFR P3 ILLNESSES AND ACCIDENTAL DEATHS </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (a). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: A spate of illnesses and accidents have left </p><p>two OFR trainers dead, and seven afflicted by malaria (one </p><p>soldier with malaria subsequently died, but from a condition </p><p>not necessarily connected with the malaria).  The Forward </p><p>Surgical Team, under the direction of the Battalion </p><p>Commander, is investigating the possible causes of seven </p><p>confirmed cases of malaria.  While the details of these cases </p><p>have been reported in other channels, we repeat them for the </p><p>Department\'s information.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==================================== </p><p>LIGHT ANTITANK WEAPON RANGE ACCIDENT </p><p>==================================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On November 1, during LAW (Light Anti-Tank Weapon) </p><p>training with the 20th battalion, Serti, a LAW misfired.  A </p><p>subsequent effort by three soldiers to destroy the misfired </p><p>weapon led to a premature detonation, with the soldiers in </p><p>close proximity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The three wounded soldiers were evacuated by </p><p>helicopter to Abuja for treatment by the Forward Surgical </p><p>Team (FST).  No host nation personnel were injured in the </p><p>incident. The most seriously injured was SSG Adam Harding, </p><p>who sustained injuries to his carotid artery and was in </p><p>respiratory distress.  He was stabilized and placed on a </p><p>ventilator.  Harding was then evacuated to Landstuhl Army </p><p>Medical Center via a contracted medical-evacuation flight. </p><p>Despite these efforts, Harding\'s condition deteriorated.  He </p><p>died on November 4. In the same incident, SSG Joseph B. Smith </p><p>was seriously injured, sustaining what appeared to be right </p><p>side neurological deficit, and shrapnel wounds to the face, </p><p>neck, left hand, lower legs, chest, and abdomen. Smith also </p><p>was evacuated to Landstuhl.  Surgery was successfully </p><p>completed, and Smith was evacuated to the U.S. on November </p><p>10.  The prospect for his full recovery is unknown. SSG </p><p>Joseph A. Vollenberg received superficial wounds to his face </p><p>and neck.  Vollenberg was evacuated via a commercial airline </p><p>to his home station where he was treated on an outpatient </p><p>basis.  He is expected to recover fully. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============= </p><p>ROAD ACCIDENT </p><p>============= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On November 7, two U.S. soldiers and a Nigerian </p><p>civilian PAE contract driver, while traveling in convoy from </p><p>Abuja to Kachia in Kaduna State, were injured in a </p><p>single-vehicle accident.  The vehicle veered out of control </p><p>on a bad section of road, overturning in a ditch at a high </p><p>rate of speed.  Injured were SFC Laurance Morgan, who </p><p>suffered a head laceration and dislocated right shoulder, and </p><p>SSG Pierre LaGuerre, who sustained a fractured right leg, a </p><p>laceration to the right leg, an unstable left knee, and a </p><p>bruised right lung.  The PAE driver sustained hip and back </p><p>injuries.  All three were evacuated to the FST in Abuja via </p><p>helicopter.  Although none of the injuries was life </p><p>threatening, the soldiers were evacuated to Landstuhl as a </p><p>precautionary measure, and the driver was transferred to a </p><p>local medical facility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>MYSTERIOUS MALARIA CASES </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On November 13, during a planned stop at Ascension </p><p>Island while en route to Ft. Bragg from Nigeria, SSG Terry </p><p>Kentcy was diagnosed with Falciparum malaria.  Medical </p><p>personnel decided to continue movement of Kentcy to Roosevelt </p><p>Roads Naval Base, Puerto Rico.  Upon arrival at Roosevelt </p><p>Roads, he was moved to the Veterans Administration (VA) </p><p>hospital in Santiago, PR.  Kentcy was stabilized and </p><p>reportedly recovering satisfactorily.  However, during the </p><p>early morning hours of November 16, Kentcy began experiencing </p><p>chest pains and breathing difficulties.  Kentcy went into </p><p>cardiac arrest shortly thereafter and medical personnel were </p><p>unable to revive him.  The autopsy indicates Kentcy died of a </p><p>pulmonary embolism.  It is unclear but unlikely that Kency\'s </p><p>death was directly connected to malaria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) SFC Jody Free was diagnosed with cerebral malaria by </p><p>the FST.  He was evacuated on November 13 to Landstuhl. Prior </p><p>to boarding the aircraft, Free slipped into a coma and was </p><p>placed on life support.  While under treatment in Germany, </p><p>Free contracted pneumonia and was placed on dialysis.  On </p><p>November 28, Free was evacuated to the United States.  Our </p><p>last reports indicate that he was off dialysis, conscious, </p><p>lucid, and rapidly recovering. </p><p>7. (C) There have been five other cases of malaria among </p><p>soldiers participating in OFR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: From an operational and political </p><p>perspective, OFR III has been a resounding success, </p><p>characterized by tremendous support from the Nigerian Army </p><p>and Ministry of Defense.  This is in marked contrast to the </p><p>lack of bilateral cooperation in OFR Phase I.  This success, </p><p>however, has been dampened by the tragic accidents and </p><p>illnesses described above.  The seven malaria cases are </p><p>troubling, particularly when compared to Phase I, which had </p><p>none (DATT COMMENT: Phase I personnel resided in hotels, not </p><p>tents.  END DATT COMMENT).  FST personnel are investigating </p><p>the causes, including the possibility of: a strain of </p><p>resistant malaria; degraded anti-malarial medication; or, </p><p>soldiers not taking their medication.  The third possibility </p><p>appears unlikely, as initial reports from unit medics </p><p>indicate full compliance with the prescribed medical regimen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT CONT: During Phase I, the trainers (and FOB </p><p>personnel) lived in hotels, and were often indoors at dawn </p><p>and dusk, when the possibility of contracting malaria </p><p>significantly increases.  However, for reasons of force </p><p>protection, the trainers did not use hotels for Phase III. </p><p>Thus, Phase III trainers have lived in open-air camps, and </p><p>were significantly more susceptible to malaria-bearing </p><p>mosquitoes.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
