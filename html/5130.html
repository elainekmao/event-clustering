(U) Classified by Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Thomas </p><p>E. Williams for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  According to UAEG reports, the UAE </p><p>pledged $36 million at the Tokyo Conference and has </p><p>provided additional humanitarian and reconstruction </p><p>assistance to Afghanistan totaling approximately $80 </p><p>million since 9/11, for a total assistance package thus far </p><p>of approximately $116 million.  Of the assistance already </p><p>distributed, we estimate that the UAEG provided about $53 </p><p>million in assistance in November and December 2002.  The </p><p>UAEG has supported a wide range of projects, from providing </p><p>food, housing and clothing to repatriating refugees to </p><p>building homes, hospitals and mosques.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>Tokyo Pledge </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In a document dated 21 December 2002, the UAEG </p><p>confirmed that the UAEG pledged $36 million towards the </p><p>reconstruction of Afghanistan at the January 2002 Tokyo </p><p>Conference.  Of this $36 million, the UAEG allocated $30 </p><p>million towards reconstruction and $6 million towards </p><p>humanitarian aid.  The latest UAEG reports indicate that </p><p>the $30 million reconstruction pledge is still pending and </p><p>awaiting decision-making as to its use.  Preliminary UAEG </p><p>reports state that the reconstruction pledge will likely be </p><p>used for road reconstruction. </p><p> </p><p>Additional UAEG Assistance to the Afghan Government </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The UAEG has donated an additional approximate $7.6 </p><p>million in assistance to the Afghan government, including a </p><p>donation to the Afghan People\'s Fund in December 2002, cash </p><p>assistance in payment of government employee salaries, and </p><p>in-kind assistance of vehicles and transportation </p><p>equipment. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) In November 2002, the UAEG delivered an additional </p><p>$50 million assistance-in-kind donation to the Afghan </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>Assistance from the UAE Red Crescent Authority </p><p>and the H.H. Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum </p><p>Humanitarian and Charity Establishment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The UAEG reports that the UAE Red Crescent </p><p>Authority (RCA) thus far has donated approximately $14 </p><p>million in additional humanitarian and reconstruction </p><p>assistance to Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Of the $14 million RCA donation, assistance valued </p><p>at about $9.2 million has already been delivered for </p><p>various projects.  Illustrative examples of these projects </p><p>include building, supplying and operating refugee camps; </p><p>providing food, clothing, medicines, medical supplies, </p><p>ambulance cars and transportation vehicles; providing </p><p>financial aid in support of the educational sector; hosting </p><p>Ramadan iftars; assisting orphans; and providing computer </p><p>and communication equipment to the Afghan Red Crescent </p><p>Society. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Of the $14 million RCA donation, development </p><p>projects valued at more than $4.8 million are currently </p><p>under way, including building villages; reconstructing and </p><p>maintaining orphanages; building and equipping an Afghan </p><p>Red Crescent Hospital; digging wells; and building mosques. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The UAEG also reports that the His Highness </p><p>Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum Humanitarian and Charity </p><p>Establishment has thus far donated approximately $6 million </p><p>in assistance to Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>Ad Hoc Contributions by Individuals and NGOs </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The UAEG reports that a number of individuals and </p><p>other NGOs have also donated assistance to Afghanistan </p><p>valued at more than $4 million for projects including </p><p>assisting refugees, providing armored vehicles for the </p><p>Afghan government, building orphanages and building a women </p><p>and children\'s hospital. </p><p> </p><p>Amount delivered in past 2 months </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The UAEG delivered the following assistance between </p><p>November 2002 and January 2003: </p><p> </p><p>     --In November 2002, the UAEG delivered an in-kind </p><p>       donation of $50 million in machinery and equipment </p><p>       to the Afghan government. As part of this package, </p><p>       the UAEG intends to deliver an additional in-kind </p><p>       assistance package of vehicles and IT/media and </p><p>       office equipment to the Afghan government. </p><p> </p><p>     --In December 2002, the UAEG announced a $3 million </p><p>       donation to the Afghan People\'s Fund. </p><p>Type of Assistance and Projects Supported </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>9.  (U) Since 9/11, the UAE\'s assistance to Afghanistan has </p><p>supported a wide range of reconstruction and humanitarian </p><p>projects, including: </p><p> </p><p>     --payment of government employee salaries; </p><p>     --financial support for the educational sector; </p><p>     --assistance to refugees; </p><p>     --building, operating and supplying refugee camps; </p><p>     --voluntary repatriation of refugees in cooperation </p><p>       with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the </p><p>       Pakistani authorities; </p><p>     --vehicles, including armored vehicles for the </p><p>       President, ambulances, fire trucks; </p><p>     --heavy machinery for civil construction </p><p>     --building, reconditioning and maintaining orphanages; </p><p>     --assistance to orphans; </p><p>     --building and equipping a women and children\'s </p><p>       hospital; </p><p>     --building and equipping an Afghan Red Crescent </p><p>       hospital; </p><p>     --hosting Ramadan iftars for the poor and needy; </p><p>     --office furniture, equipment and supplies; </p><p>     --communications and IT/media equipment; </p><p>     --food; clothing; medical supplies; medicines; </p><p>     --communication and computer equipment for the Afghan </p><p>       Red Crescent Society; </p><p>     --digging wells; </p><p>     --rebuilding villages; </p><p>     --building mosques. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The UAEG does not generally seek </p><p>publicity for its charitable giving, even though it does so </p><p>generously.  The UAE has far exceeded its Tokyo pledge. </p><p>Emirati officials, however, report that they continue to </p><p>consider additional requests for assistance.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
