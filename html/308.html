THIS NUMBER, HOWEVER, PROBABLY DOES NOT </p><p>INCLUDE MANY UNIONISTS AND PERSONS OFFICIALLY </p><p>UNAFFILIATED WITH A PARTY WHO COULD BE CONSIDERED </p><p>POLITICAL DETAINEES.

FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER MOHAMMED TEWFIQ (DUP) AND </p><p>SADIQ\'S WIFE SARRA AL-FADIL AL-MAHDI ARE AMONG A NUMBER </p><p>OF OTHER POLITICIANS RELEASED (SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>5.

COMMENT.  FORMER PRESIDENT CARTER\'S VISIT TO KHARTOUM </p><p>NOVEMBER 17-18 PROBABLY PLAYED A ROLE IN THE TIMING OF </p><p>THE LONG-RUMORED RELEASES OF POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS. </p><p>THE RELEASES APPEAR TO BE PART OF AN ONGOING EFFORT BY </p><p>THE RCC TOWARD DEFUSING OPPOSITION AND BROADENING THEIR </p><p>BASE OF SUPPORT.  THE PARTY LEADERS WERE APPARENTLY </p><p>RELEASED UNCONDITIONALLY AFTER PARTY REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>SIGNED A DOCUMENT SUPPORTING GOS EFFORTS TOWARD NATIONAL </p><p>RECONICILIATION.  MANY SUDANESE BELIEVE A CABINET </p><p>RESHUFFLE BRINGING DUP, UMMA AND NIF MEMBERS INTO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MAY BE IN THE CARDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
