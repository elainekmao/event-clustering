<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002409 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DATE SET TO HEAR AIPPA CHALLENGE; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   On November 21 Zimbabwe\'s Supreme Court will hear </p><p>    a challenge to the controversial Access to Information </p><p>    and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA).  The case, </p><p>    brought by journalists working in Zimbabwe\'s privately </p><p>    owned media, seeks the Court\'s ruling on the </p><p>    constitutionality of several important sections of the </p><p>    AIPPA.  November 21 is also deadline for journalists to </p><p>    comply with AIPPA registration requirements. </p><p> </p><p>2.   The legal challenge to AIPPA focuses on sections </p><p>    of the Act proscribing "abuse of journalistic </p><p>    privilege" and "publishing falsehoods."  In October the </p><p>    Government of Zimbabwe introduced amendments to AIPPA </p><p>    in an attempt to clarify some of the Act\'s vague </p><p>    language, but journalists here remain convinced that </p><p>    the Act violates constitutional guarantees of freedom </p><p>    of expression.  The suit also challenges the unchecked </p><p>    powers of the government\'s Media and Information </p><p>    Commission (set up as part of AIPPA) and the mandatory </p><p>    registration of journalists and media organizations by </p><p>    November 21, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Journalists who are party to the suit are not </p><p>    sanguine about its outcome.  The government has forced </p><p>    the retirement of respected justices and appointed </p><p>    replacements and additional justices who are clearly </p><p>    sympathetic to the current government\'s political </p><p>    agenda.  The Supreme Court is most likely to dismiss </p><p>    the challenge to AIPPA.  Journalists understand this </p><p>    but believe that challenging the law is the only </p><p>    principled action to take.  They also hope that the </p><p>    challenge will generate new international awareness of </p><p>    the continuing restrictions on civil liberties and </p><p>    human rights in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
