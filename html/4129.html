<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002961 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, AF/EPS </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>STATE PASS DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, EINV, EAIR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ECONOMIC ROUNDUP OCTOBER 30 </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2768 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This periodic economic report includes: </p><p>--U.S.-Nigeria Air Cargo: Taking Advantage of AGOA </p><p>--GON Re-Thinks Nigeria Airways Deal </p><p>--GON to Set Domestic Content Requirement for JV Oil Contracts </p><p>--Local Concerns Over Niger Delta Dredging </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S.-Nigeria Air Cargo: Taking Advantage of AGOA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>2. U.S. Export-Import Bank Director Joseph Grandmaison and </p><p>Ambassador Jeter met Minister of Aviation Kema Chikwe in </p><p>Abuja last week to encourage Nigerian participation at the </p><p>November 19-20 African Regional Air Cargo Transport </p><p>Initiative forum in Washington, D.C. A U.S. Trade and </p><p>Development Agency (TDA) consultant made the same pitch last </p><p>week to Lagos-based officials at the Ministry of Aviation, </p><p>Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, and Federal Airport </p><p>Authority of Nigeria (FAAN). The air cargo initiative, </p><p>sponsored by TDA, the Department of Transportation, and the </p><p>Ex-Im Bank, seeks to encourage air cargo transport between </p><p>Africa and the United States and, indirectly, bilateral trade </p><p>under AGOA. Grandmaison explained in his meeting with Chikwe </p><p>that much of the tariff savings under AGOA are unrealized </p><p>because shipping--most often via Europe--is costly for trade </p><p>between the United States and Africa, nullifying the </p><p>advantage to Africa that AGOA was designed to bestow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The TDA consultant reports that FAAN officials in Lagos </p><p>recognize the benefits of a strong air cargo link to the </p><p>United States. In anticipation of increased air cargo </p><p>traffic, FAAN is expanding cargo facilities at Murtala </p><p>Muhammed Airport in Lagos, and in August, a team from the </p><p>U.S. Transportation Security Administration conducted cargo </p><p>security training for FAAN officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON Re-Thinks Nigeria Airways Deal </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>4. The deal signed June 28 between UK-based Airwing Aerospace </p><p>and the Ministry of Aviation to restructure Nigeria Airways </p><p>as a joint venture called Air Nigeria is coming under </p><p>increasing scrutiny (reftel). President Obasanjo has stepped </p><p>into the fray, calling for the establishment of a ten-person </p><p>committee to review the Air Nigeria deal and chart a new way </p><p>forward for a Nigerian national carrier. The Bureau of Public </p><p>Enterprises\' Director of Operations Tijjani Abdullahi </p><p>promises Econoff that additional details on the committee </p><p>will be available in the weeks to come. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON to Set Domestic Content Requirement for JV Oil Contracts </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>5. Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum </p><p>Corporation (NNPC) Jackson Gaius-Obaseki is reported in the </p><p>local press as having announced in Ulsan, South Korea, that </p><p>future contracts for joint ventures in oil and gas </p><p>exploration and extraction will include a 25 percent </p><p>local-content requirement. He suggested that basic </p><p>construction and engineering, in particular, could be </p><p>procured locally. Separately, Chairman of the Senate </p><p>Committee on Petroleum Resources David Brigidi told Econoff </p><p>that the National Assembly is considering a "Local Content </p><p>Act" that would likely be passed this year. The current draft </p><p>of that bill does not specify the amount of local content </p><p>that would be required. (Comment: To date, there has been no </p><p>discussion of how that local content would be procured, </p><p>whether in foreign exchange or Nigerian naira. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Oil executives in Lagos and Port Hartcourt told Econoffs </p><p>that these new policies would pose major obstacles for future </p><p>investments. However, there appears to be confusion among </p><p>them about the amount of domestic content that would be </p><p>required, with estimates ranging from 30 to 50 percent. Post </p><p>will follow this issue closely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Local Concerns Over Niger Delta Dredging </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>7. Chief Dr. E.A. Emerhi, national president of Nigeria\'s </p><p>office of the International Association for Impact </p><p>Assessments (IAIA), told Emboffs that the IAIA has not yet </p><p>staked out a position on whether the Niger River should be </p><p>dredged. Emerhi discussed the perspectives of large-scale </p><p>traders (who support the project) and smaller farming </p><p>communities (who oppose it). The Nigerian delegation to the </p><p>November 7-8, 2002, conference sponsored by Tulane University </p><p>and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in New Orleans on </p><p>"Comparing Rivers: The Mississippi and the Niger" will </p><p>include members of diverse ethnic and geographical background </p><p>as well as government, academic, and private sector </p><p>representatives who will present these viewpoints. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Emerhi said that the GON has not yet demonstrated the </p><p>capacity nor will to address local concerns over the proposed </p><p>dredging project, but she is hopeful that government </p><p>officials will become more sensitive to these concerns </p><p>through participation in conferences like the one being held </p><p>next month in New Orleans. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
