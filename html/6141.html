<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000300 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p>LABOR FOR ILAB </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PHUM, PREL, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: ILO PUSHES FOR PROGRESS ON FORCED LABOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  On February 28, ILO Liaison Officer Ms. </p><p>Perret-Nguyen provided Emboffs with a status report on her </p><p>efforts to engage the regime on forced labor before the ILO </p><p>Governing Board meeting on Burma in late March.  Ms. </p><p>Perret-Nguyen has been focusing on getting the regime to </p><p>accept a plan of action on forced labor to present to the </p><p>Governing Board.  To date, the regime has not agreed to </p><p>include even minimally necessary elements in the plan of </p><p>action such as a pilot project area or a mediator.  In </p><p>addition, the military, the primary user of forced labor in </p><p>Burma, still remains off limits to the government\'s </p><p>implementation committee on forced labor.  Ms. Perret-Nguyen </p><p>is encouraging the U.S. and others to impress upon the </p><p>Burmese government the importance of providing at least a </p><p>minimally acceptable plan of action to the GB.  Otherwise, </p><p>she expects GB members will have run out of patience with </p><p>regime delays and move to enforcing sanctions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>No News is Bad News </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ILO Liaison Officer Ms. Perret-Nguyen told Emboffs on </p><p>February 28 that she is frustrated with the lack of progress </p><p>on forced labor in Burma since her arrival in Rangoon six </p><p>months ago.  Specifically, she said the Convention 29 </p><p>Implementation Committee the government established in </p><p>response to the ILO\'s call for action on forced labor </p><p>continues to be ineffectual and the government is dragging </p><p>its feet on submitting a meaningful plan of action to the </p><p>Governing Body. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Perret-Nguyen said the Implementation Committee </p><p>members are always polite and cordial to her but on substance </p><p>there has been no progress.  She said that when she brings </p><p>allegations of forced labor to the committee\'s attention it </p><p>invariably reports back that there was no evidence to support </p><p>the allegations or, if there was evidence, military </p><p>operations were involved and the committee could not </p><p>intervene.  She said that she continues to receive credible </p><p>reports that forced labor continues unabated in all areas </p><p>where the military is active.  Perret-Nguyen is convinced </p><p>that the military commanders have not received any </p><p>instructions on how to implement the 1999 and 2000 directives </p><p>issued to curtail the use of forced labor, so they continue </p><p>with past practices.  She said that the patience of the </p><p>Governing Body with the regime\'s delays on taking action </p><p>against forced labor are wearing thin and the government </p><p>needs to provide clear evidence that it will put action </p><p>behind its words at the March Governing Body meeting. </p><p> </p><p>Key Elements In Plan of Action </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Ms. Perret-Nguyen said she has worked hard to </p><p>convince the regime of the benefits of a sound plan of action </p><p>on forced labor but it has been very slow going.  She has </p><p>focused on the following priorities: 1) the designation of a </p><p>mediator or facilitator to receive complaints and liaise with </p><p>the Implementation Committee; 2) an assessment of the </p><p>complaints evaluation system; 3) a study of alternatives to </p><p>the use of forced labor; 4) the reform of the system for </p><p>inspections and allegation verifications;  5) a public </p><p>information campaign; and 6) an ILO-funded pilot area. </p><p>Perret-Nguyen said that although the ILO and the government </p><p>have exchanged drafts of a proposed work plan they are "no </p><p>where near" agreement on a text.  She said her encouragement </p><p>that when the regime begins to show action on the problem </p><p>assistance will be forthcoming appears to be falling on deaf </p><p>ears. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  As the Governing Body meeting draws near, </p><p>Perret-Nguyen has honed in on obtaining a minimally </p><p>acceptable plan of action from the government just to have </p><p>something to show at the meeting.  Her office would not claim </p><p>that this minimal plan is sufficient but it would give the GB </p><p>something to review.  Her bottom line on a "minimally </p><p>acceptable" plan would include the creation of a mediator and </p><p>the acceptance of a pilot project, points the government has </p><p>not yet been willing to accept.  She said that even if the GB </p><p>determines that this minimal plan is not good enough, she </p><p>could use that feedback to push for a better plan. </p><p> </p><p>Last Ditch Efforts? </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Perret-Nguyen said she hopes the regime relents at </p><p>the last minute and agrees to the minimally acceptable plan </p><p>of action, noting that the regime has a history of responding </p><p>to the ILO officials when they are at the airport about to </p><p>leave Rangoon.  For example, she said, when she was departing </p><p>for Geneva for the last GB meeting, the regime presented her </p><p>with three points or concessions to address ILO concerns. </p><p>(Note: One of these was to appoint a representative of the </p><p>Inspector General\'s office to the Implementation Committee in </p><p>order to provide the committee with a link to military </p><p>authorities; this appointment never materialized according to </p><p>Perret-Nguyen.  End Note.) She said she hopes the regime will </p><p>do the same this time and present her with the minimally </p><p>acceptable work plan just before she leaves town.  She is not </p><p>convinced, however, that the regime understands the </p><p>importance of delivering a plan of action to the GB meeting. </p><p>She senses that either the regime does not understand that GB </p><p>patience for continued delays has run out or that it does not </p><p>care.  She requested that the U.S. provide any support it can </p><p>prior to the GB meeting to impress upon the Burmese that it </p><p>is time for action on forced labor.  She said she has </p><p>approached others in the diplomatic community to support her </p><p>efforts.  If the regime does not accept at least some of the </p><p>ILO\'s recommendations for the plan of action, Perret-Nguyen </p><p>believes the GB will toughen its stance and revisit </p><p>implementation of sanctions agreed to in 2000 but held in </p><p>abeyance pending actions by the regime. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Comment:  The Chief of Mission will meet with the </p><p>Minister of Labor to impress upon him the importance of </p><p>demonstrating to the GB the regime\'s commitment to addressing </p><p>forced labor.  We will point out the benefits of a pilot </p><p>project and a mediator, and encourage an improved </p><p>investigation and enforcement mechanism.  Unfortunately, it </p><p>is likely that the Minister of Labor understands these issues </p><p>all too well but is not in a position to determine whether or </p><p>not to cooperate with the ILO.  The junta\'s military leaders </p><p>dictate these matters and they have a long-held vested </p><p>interest in using forced labor to support the military </p><p>infrastructure.  Perret-Nguyen noted that the military </p><p>continues to remain outside the Implementation Committee and </p><p>does not appear to have any commitment to reducing forced </p><p>labor.  Until this changes, we can expect cooperation with </p><p>the ILO mission to be slow at best. End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
