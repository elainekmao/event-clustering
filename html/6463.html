The Council of </p><p>Ministers will convene in an extraordinary session today, </p><p>and the decree will be taken to parliament before the vote </p><p>of confidence for the Erdogan cabinet.  Papers expect the </p><p>motion to be voted on by the parliament on Thursday. </p><p>Commentators agree that Erdogan will have a difficult time </p><p>trying to convince his deputies that Turkey\'s interests </p><p>require working together with the U.S.  Dailies say the AKP </p><p>leadership has asked the U.S. to put into effect the </p><p>military, political, and economic cooperation package once </p><p>the motion is approved.  Dailies report U.S. officials </p><p>issuing clear warnings about possible damage to U.S.-Turkish </p><p>relations at the American-Turkish Business Council meetings </p><p>(ATC) in Washington.  Iraqi opposition groups will meet in </p><p>Ankara at a summit meeting Tuesday under the auspices of </p><p>Turkey and the United States.  Northern Iraqi Kurdish groups </p><p>will voice concern about a possible unilateral Turkish </p><p>intervention in the region, and Iraqi Shiite and Arab </p><p>representatives are expected to join discussions on a post- </p><p>war Iraq tomorrow.  Ankara will seek to secure a place for </p><p>the Turkomen in a post-Saddam administration.  Commentaries </p><p>fear that Kurds, Arabs and Turkomen might engage in Balkan- </p><p>type ethnic fighting over Kirkuk, the oil-rich town in </p><p>Northern Iraq.  Residents have started evacuating Kirkuk and </p><p>Mosul, and are fleeing to the north near the Turkish border, </p><p>according to reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> "Along with the war, authorization issue is back" </p><p>Hasan Cemal wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (3/18): "Realizing </p><p>the urgency, the government now has two options:  Asking for </p><p>parliament\'s approval for both the deployment of troops and </p><p>airspace rights following the vote of confidence, or moving </p><p>the motion through parliament ahead of the confidence vote. </p><p>Yet the financial markets cannot sit and wait to see which </p><p>option is taken.  We have already seen the initial signs of </p><p>instability in the markets. . Secretary Powell gave a clear </p><p>message by saying that `the time for diplomacy has ended.\' </p><p>Following the ultimatum from George Bush, Ankara is now once </p><p>again seized by the issue of the decree.  Bearing in mind </p><p>the urgency, the government will probably go for the second </p><p>option.  The summit at the Presidential Palace acknowledged </p><p>that war is imminent and inevitable.  Yet the real question </p><p>is this: wouldn\'t it have been more appropriate if Turkey </p><p>had taken these steps earlier?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Declaring the loser" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in the Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(3/18): "The war-mongering trio did their best to take </p><p>others to their side.  Moreover, the world witnessed an </p><p>unprecedented method of threats, blackmail and false </p><p>information.  Yet the US, the UK and Spain did not get any </p><p>support for their war project except from each other.  This </p><p>is clearly a defeat for the war-mongering lobby.  The war, </p><p>even though it targets a very hated man like Saddam Hussein, </p><p>failed to gain international support.  Thus the project can </p><p>be implemented, but will suffer from a lack of vitality.  If </p><p>they begin the war as they now threaten to do, the very </p><p>first bullet will turn the US and UK into defeated powers in </p><p>the eyes of the world." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
