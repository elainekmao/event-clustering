<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 002752 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12598:DECL: 09/27/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, PINS, IV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: MGIV01: NIGERIAN OUTLOOK ON COTE D\'IVOIRE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 1835335 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM ANDREWS. REASONS 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On September 25, DCM delivered reftel points to </p><p>National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed and PolCouns </p><p>carried the same message to the Presidential </p><p>International Affairs Advisor Ad\'Obe Obe. Both </p><p>officials confirmed Nigeria did not favor a resort to </p><p>force and endorsed a negotiated resolution of the </p><p>impasse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) NSA Mohammed expressed concern about reports </p><p>of the Gbagbo government harassment of opposition </p><p>parties and figures, including Bedie and Ouattara. The </p><p>NSA advised President Obasanjo to urge Gbagbo to stop </p><p>the harassment before it generated further </p><p>instability. He added that the senior-level GON </p><p>military delegation had returned from Abidjan and had </p><p>provided their assessment. Mohammed acknowledged </p><p>Nigeria would send five Alpha jets to Cote d\'Ivoire </p><p>based on a request for assistance from the Gbagbo </p><p>government. However, Mohammed stressed Nigeria would </p><p>only deploy ground troops under ECOWAS aegis. Note: </p><p>The GON eventually sent three Alpha jets and two </p><p>attack helicopters to Cote d\' Ivoire, according to </p><p>information acquired through DOD sources.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Presidential Advisor Obe underscored GON </p><p>concern that the situation be resolved peacefully but </p><p>relatively quickly. With accusing Ivoirien fingers </p><p>already pointing at Burkina Faso, a protracted impasse </p><p>with the rebels would only increase tension between </p><p>the two countries and foment more xenophobia and </p><p>harassment of opposition figures within Cote d\'Ivoire. </p><p>Fearing that Gbagbo militants had taken the failed </p><p>putsch as a license to target his opponents, many </p><p>people have gone into hiding, with Ouattara allegedly </p><p>finding respite in the French Ambassador\'s residence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On September 26, the ECOWAS Executive </p><p>Secretary\'s Military Advisor, Colonel Dixon Dikio, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>told PolCouns that Executive Secretary Chambas had </p><p>gone to Abidjan and Ouagadougou on a fact-finding </p><p>mission. He expected Chambas to return to Abuja </p><p>September 27.  Dikio also stated that the emergency </p><p>ECOWAS Summit on Cote d\'Ivoire had been pushed back to </p><p>October 5 vice September 28. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
