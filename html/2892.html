<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000906 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p>NSC FOR HARRY THOMAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, MCAP, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS ATTACK OUTPOSTS IN ROLPA AND SANKHUWASABHA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 787 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 872 </p><p>     C. (C) KATHMANDU 882 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  On the night of May 7 Maoist insurgents </p><p>attacked a combined Royal Nepal Army (RNA) and police outpost </p><p>in Gam, Rolpa in western Nepal.  The attack in Rolpa follows </p><p>the RNA\'s routing of a Maoist camp at another location in the </p><p>same district (Refs B and C).  The RNA has lost contact with </p><p>the soldiers under attack in Gam, and helicopters sent to the </p><p>site have been unable to land.  In addition, at least four </p><p>APF and 14 Maoists were killed in an attack on an Armed </p><p>Police Force (AFP) base camp in Sankhuwasabha in the </p><p>northeast.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  At about 11:00 p.m. on May 7 Maoist insurgents </p><p>attacked a combined company of security forces:  one platoon </p><p>of about 70 Royal Nepal Army (RNA) soldiers and two platoons </p><p>of mixed regular and Armed Police Force (APF) police, </p><p>commanded by an RNA major, in a temporary deployment position </p><p>in Gam, Rolpa.  (Note:  Gam is about 30 KM northeast of Lisne </p><p>Lek, where the RNA had engaged Maoists at a training camp May </p><p>1-5.  End note.)  At the time of the attack, 40 of the RNA </p><p>soldiers at the camp, along with 20 policemen, were deployed </p><p>out in blocking positions to cut off Maoists escaping from </p><p>the RNA attack on the training camp at Lisne Lek (Refs B and </p><p>C), leaving the RNA platoon at less than half its normal </p><p>strength.  The division subsequently lost radio </p><p>communications with the outpost.  As of mid-day May 8, bad </p><p>weather and smoke had obstructed attempts to fly helicopters </p><p>to the site. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Because of the communications black-out, the RNA </p><p>is unable to confirm the number of casualties.  In general, </p><p>however, RNA sources contacted were not optimistic.  There </p><p>have also been unconfirmed reports of smoke coming from the </p><p>village of Gam, raising some fears that the Maoists may have </p><p>exacted revenge on villagers. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Just before midnight April 8 Maoists also attacked </p><p>an Armed Police Force (APF) base camp at Chainpur, </p><p>Sankhuwasabha in northeastern Nepal.  Fighting continued </p><p>until 3:00 a.m. Casualties reported thus far amount to 4 APF </p><p>and 14 Maoists killed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment:  Gam, which Embassy DATT visited May 1, is </p><p>one of several towns "liberated" by the RNA from Maoist </p><p>control and subsequently garrisoned by combined </p><p>RNA/police/APF (Ref A).  In the heart of Maoist </p><p>territory--where Maoists launched their first attack on </p><p>police six years ago--these garrison towns are a direct </p><p>challenge to the insurgents right in their own neighborhood. </p><p>The RNA has thus been expecting attacks on the towns for some </p><p>time; the insurgents surprised at the Lisne Lek camp (Refs A </p><p>and B) were believed to have been massing for just such an </p><p>attack.  It seems unlikely that the attack on Gam could have </p><p>been staged from Lisne Lek, although the Army admits a number </p><p>of insurgents were able to escape from the area with their </p><p>weapons.  The attack on Gam raises the possibility of other </p><p>staging/training camps in the area besides the one discovered </p><p>by the RNA. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
