(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: The collapse of Saddam\'s regime and </p><p>an avowed U.S. policy of encouraging greater </p><p>political participation and economic reform across </p><p>the region in the post 9/11 environment have </p><p>increased expectations within intellectual circles </p><p>here that a broadening of the UAE\'s extremely </p><p>limited political space is only a matter of time. </p><p>A number of reform-minded Emiratis have raised this </p><p>issue with the Ambassador and other mission </p><p>officers.  These Emiratis hope and believe the time </p><p>is ripe for USG engagement with the UAE leadership. </p><p>The Ambassador intends to continue raising the </p><p>issue with senior Emiratis but we believe that in </p><p>order for our message to have traction, other USG </p><p>interlocutors -- particularly senior Washington </p><p>officials -- should use the occasion of meetings </p><p>with the UAEG leadership to engage them on the </p><p>subject.  As we proceed with the Middle East </p><p>Partnership Initiative (MEPI) in the UAE, we </p><p>recommend an initial focus on rule of law, civil </p><p>society, education curriculum reform, women\'s </p><p>empowerment and a strengthened NGO movement as the </p><p>building blocks for a gradual liberalization of the </p><p>UAE polity (see septel for our specific MEPI </p><p>recommendations).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>DUBAI DISTRICT COUNCIL ANNOUNCEMENT GENERATES </p><p>DISCUSSION OF BROADER POLITICAL PARTICIPATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Dubai\'s announcement in April (Ref B) of the </p><p>establishment of elected district councils touched </p><p>a chord amongst elite Emiratis who have wanted to </p><p>see the UAE federal government take steps towards </p><p>liberalization.  Dubai\'s move came on the heels of </p><p>the wide-ranging political reforms undertaken by </p><p>Qatar and Bahrain.  The savvy Dubbyans, wishing to </p><p>maintain their city-state\'s reputation as an </p><p>international business and tourism hub, realized </p><p>the importance of making a similar opening although </p><p>it is not clear if this is a genuine step toward </p><p>political liberalization. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador and de facto Foreign Minister </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid have discussed both Dubai\'s </p><p>announcement and the issue of political </p><p>liberalization in the UAE in general (Ref B). </p><p>Following his talks with the Ambassador, Hamdan </p><p>apparently reached out to a range of UAE statesmen, </p><p>academics and opinion makers to take the pulse. </p><p>Hamdan personally favors a gradual political </p><p>opening at this time, noting that it would be a </p><p>nice legacy for his father, UAE President Shaykh </p><p>Zayid.  Given the wide respect and affection felt </p><p>across the UAE\'s seven emirates for Zayid, his </p><p>imprimatur would facilitate the move to </p><p>democratization.  Hamdan, who realizes that the </p><p>subject of political participation will figure </p><p>higher on the bilateral agenda than in the past, </p><p>would like to preempt a formal USG approach.  As he </p><p>put it to the Ambassador in April, "better we do it </p><p>our way," consonant with the UAE\'s cultural, </p><p>religious and social norms.  The leadership is </p><p>aware of the heightened attention being given to </p><p>democratization at home and abroad.  Abu Dhabi </p><p>Crown Prince Khalifa bin Zayid, in a rare press </p><p>interview, was more forward-leaning on the issue of </p><p>women\'s empowerment, noting that no changes would </p><p>be necessary to UAE law or the constitution in </p><p>order for women to be able to participate in the </p><p>appointed Federal National Council, but then went </p><p>on to defend the overall political status quo by </p><p>asserting that the existing domestic political </p><p>structure provides for the "inclusion of a </p><p>mechanism for consultations in decision-making." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>REFORM-MINDED EMIRATIS URGE U.S. ENGAGEMENT WITH </p><p>UAEG LEADERSHIP ON GREATER POLITICAL PARTICIPATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In the last several months, a few of the </p><p>individuals tapped by Hamdan have subsequently </p><p>contacted the Ambassador to push for USG </p><p>engagement.  Among them was former Ambassador to </p><p>the U.S. Muhammad Al-Sha\'ali who urged the </p><p>Ambassador to use her close ties to the leadership </p><p>to encourage broader participation.  Al-Sha\'ali and </p><p>others, noting the positive and rapid changes </p><p>taking place in Qatar and Bahrain and even the more </p><p>modest changes evidenced in Saudi Arabia, fear the </p><p>UAE is falling behind the region.  The Ambassador </p><p>was also approached by Dubai notable Juma\'a Al- </p><p>Majed who said a political opening is needed at the </p><p>federal level and hoped that we would use our </p><p>relationship to encourage the Feds in that </p><p>direction.  Al-Majed noted that a good place to </p><p>start would be to push for greater rule of law; he </p><p>specifically mentioned that Abu Dhabi has much work </p><p>to do in this area.  By contrast, in his view, </p><p>Dubai is in better shape; the Dubai courts may not </p><p>be "perfect" but they are far more independent than </p><p>the Abu Dhabi courts. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Embassy officers have also been approached </p><p>by contacts at the working level, many of whom have </p><p>noted the increased expectation across the UAE of </p><p>an expansion of political rights.  UAE University </p><p>Political Science professor Abdul Khaleq Abdullah </p><p>told us that Dubai made the right decision in </p><p>moving to elected councils (not yet implemented) </p><p>and hoped other emirates would follow suit. </p><p>Another prominent Emirati urged greater press </p><p>freedom and a more robust Federal National Council </p><p>(FNC -- the UAE\'s putative parliament), empowered </p><p>to discuss more than housing, education, and health </p><p>care, i.e. bread and butter, issues.  None of our </p><p>contacts expect a dramatic political opening, but </p><p>rather more on the lines of a gradual move to </p><p>elected local councils and the participation of </p><p>women in politics. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>DESPITE DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGES, UAE SOCIETY IS </p><p>HIGHLY TOLERANT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The UAE\'s lack of political participation </p><p>mechanisms is at great variance with the </p><p>considerable social, religious and economic freedom </p><p>enjoyed by nationals and non-nationals alike. </p><p>Among the greatest challenges for the Emirati </p><p>leadership is the fact that the national population </p><p>is a small percentage, estimated between 15-20 </p><p>percent, of the overall population of almost 4 </p><p>million.  The vast majority of the foreigners hail </p><p>from South Asia -- namely Pakistan and India -- and </p><p>the UAEG closely monitors these communities to </p><p>ensure that national/communal rivalries do not </p><p>spill onto the streets of the UAE.  There are also </p><p>substantial populations of expatriate Arabs, </p><p>Europeans and North Americans.  The UAE leadership </p><p>realized early on that it needed a large, talented </p><p>foreign labor pool to build the country.  From the </p><p>early days of the federation, some thirty-two years </p><p>ago, the UAEG has allowed foreigners to freely </p><p>pursue their religious beliefs and has taken a very </p><p>liberal attitude to the different social mores of </p><p>the diverse expatriate population.  Hence, a number </p><p>of Christian denominations have churches in the UAE </p><p>and there are also Hindu and Sikh temples.  The </p><p>bars and private beaches of Abu Dhabi and Dubai </p><p>could easily be mistaken for those in the </p><p>Mediterranean or southern California. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>NO GRASSROOTS PUSH FOR LIBERALIZATION... </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) It is our sense that while some Emirati </p><p>elites would like to see the government take steps </p><p>towards greater political participation, there is </p><p>by no means a "grassroots" movement pressing for </p><p>democratization.  Indeed, Emiratis appear to be </p><p>genuinely pleased with their rulers, particularly </p><p>founding father President Zayid who is widely loved </p><p>and respected. The Emiratis have the advantage of </p><p>living in one of the last cradle-to-grave welfare </p><p>states characterized by a small national population </p><p>and immense wealth mainly derived from the nation\'s </p><p>prodigious energy resources. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Helping to relieve some of the short-term </p><p>pressure is the fact that the UAE maintains a </p><p>vibrant and healthy majlis system.  These weekly </p><p>traditional gatherings of Emirati men provide an </p><p>opportunity for decision-makers to hear the </p><p>concerns of their "constituents."  Many of the </p><p>senior Al-Nahyan, including Chief of Staff Muhammad </p><p>bin Zayid and MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid hold </p><p>regular majlises (sometimes twice a week) which any </p><p>Emirati is permitted to attend.  The same is true </p><p>in the UAE\'s other emirates where influential </p><p>nationals (not just rulers) gather on a regular </p><p>basis. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>...BUT MEDIUM-TERM PRESSURE IS BUILDING </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) While the current strictures on political </p><p>participation are sustainable for the short-term, </p><p>we believe the Emiratis need to start assembling </p><p>the building blocks of a more representative </p><p>society given the pressures that they will </p><p>encounter across the medium-term.  With a more </p><p>inclusive political structure, the leadership will </p><p>be better able to develop and sustain consensus as </p><p>the choices the government needs to make in terms </p><p>of resource allocation get tougher.  At the root of </p><p>all economic/finance issues in the UAE is the fact </p><p>that each emirate retains ownership of its natural </p><p>resources.  Thus Abu Dhabi\'s oil wealth belongs to </p><p>Abu Dhabi and is "shared" at Abu Dhabi emirate\'s </p><p>discretion with the Federation and other emirates. </p><p>The primary mechanism for this is Abu Dhabi\'s </p><p>funding of the federal budget -- the federal </p><p>payroll being the primary provider or jobs for UAE </p><p>nationals. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The UAE\'s national population is growing at </p><p>an exponential rate thus increasing the need to </p><p>produce employment for nationals.  The gap between </p><p>the rich and the not so well off is widening, </p><p>particularly between Abu Dhabi and the other, non- </p><p>oil producing emirates.  In the poorer northern </p><p>emirates, living conditions for UAE nationals vary </p><p>from good to inadequate.  In Ras Al-Khaimah, for </p><p>instance, some nationals do not have access to safe </p><p>drinking water, sufficient electricity and adequate </p><p>housing.  In that regard, Abu Dhabi\'s decision to </p><p>build a water desalination plant in Fujairah to </p><p>ensure the supply of water for the date palm groves </p><p>of Al-Ain has not gone over well with the northern </p><p>Emiratis (nor has Abu Dhabi\'s opting out of the </p><p>poorly resourced federal health care system in </p><p>order to ensure better care for its residents), </p><p>highlighting some of the undercurrents of </p><p>political, social and economic tension likely to </p><p>surface in the event of more meaningful political </p><p>dialogue here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
