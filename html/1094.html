(C) ECON OFFICER RECENTLY LEARNED FROM THE WORLD </p><p>BANK\'S RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE THAT ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ARREARS TO THE IBRD AS OF MAY 29 TOTALED </p><p>APPROXIMATELY U.S.$18 MILLION.  INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS </p><p>FROM ZIMBABWE TO THE BANK ARE DUE FORTNIGHTLY, AND </p><p>ARE USUALLY IN THE U.S. $4 TO $5 MILLION RANGE, </p><p>THOUGH SOME PAYMENTS CLIMB TO $8 OR $9 MILLION, </p><p>DEPENDING ON THE REPAYMENT SCHEDULES OF PREVIOUS </p><p>LOANS.  ANOTHER PAYMENT WAS DUE ON MAY 30, WHICH </p><p>WOULD BRING THE NOW 75 DAYS IN ARREARS TOTAL TO </p><p>APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DUE TO THE PLEDGING OF A LARGE SHARE OF THE </p><p>TOBACCO SALES EXPORT RECEIPTS FOR FUEL AND ENERGY </p><p>PAST-DUE BILLS (REFTEL), THE HARD CURRENCY SHORTAGE </p><p>PERSISTS AT NEAR CRISIS LEVELS AND IT IS NOT EXPECTED </p><p>TO EASE ANYTIME SOON.  THEREFORE, WE ANTICIPATE THAT </p><p>THE GOZ WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING THESE PAYMENTS, </p><p>THE MORE SO AS THE BALANCE INCREASES.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE WORLD BANK RESREP, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SEEM </p><p>RELATIVELY NONPLUSSED ABOUT THE ARREARAGE, WITH THE </p><p>RESERVE BANK GOVERNOR STATING THAT THOUGH HE IS DOING </p><p>HIS BEST, EVEN HE CANNOT GET BLOOD FROM A TURNIP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WHEN ASKED WHAT THE OUTLOOK WAS FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02895  010707Z </p><p>RESUMPTION OF LENDING AND FURTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORT, </p><p>THE RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT AFTER THE </p><p>ELECTIONS DIALOGUE WOULD HAVE TO START AFRESH WITH A </p><p>CABINET WITH NEW MEMBERS, AND A DETERMINATION MADE </p><p>THEN ON WHETHER OR NOT THE TWO BRETTON WOODS </p><p>INSTITUTIONS WOULD EVEN WANT TO REENTER THE MARKET </p><p>HERE.  "A LOT OF BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW </p><p>AND THEN, MATE" HE CONFIDED (THE RESREP IS AN </p><p>AUSTRALIAN), "AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT CAN CONTINUE TO </p><p>BE NON-COOPERATIVE."  HE CONTINUED THAT AS A </p><p>NECESSARY FIRST STEP THE IMF WOULD HAVE TO GET GOZ </p><p>AGREEMENT TO START A SHADOW PROGRAM, THAT WOULD NEED </p><p>TO LAST AT A MINIMUM FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS.  TO SAVE </p><p>TIME, THIS SAME PERIOD COULD BE USED TO WORK OUT THE </p><p>TERMS AND PERFORMANCE CRITERIA OF A NEW IMF FACILITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ONCE THE IMF GIVES THE GREEN LIGHT, THEN THE </p><p>ALREADY-APPROVED AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK FUNDS COULD </p><p>BE RELEASED (APPROXIMATELY U.S. $45 MILLION), HE </p><p>EXPLAINED, AND AT THE SAME TIME THE WORLD BANK AND </p><p>THE EU COULD RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE PATH FORWARD. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE POINTED OUT, IF THE ARREARS SITUATION </p><p>CONTINUES OR WORSENS, THEIR HANDS WILL BE TIED.  THE </p><p>WORLD BANK PLANS TO HOST A QUARTERLY ALL-DAY DONORS </p><p>DISCUSSION ON MAY 31, AT WHICH THE FOREGOING TOPICS </p><p>AND A HOST OF OTHER ISSUES WILL BE DISCUSSED IN </p><p>DEPTH.  THE MISSION WILL BE REPRESENTED AT THAT </p><p>GATHERING BY THE USAID DIRECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p></div>
