<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000953 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: SULTANBEYLI: A HIGHWAY RUNS THROUGH IT... AND </p><p>DOESN\'T STOP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary and Comment: A recent visit to Sultanbeyli, </p><p>one of Istanbul\'s poorer Asian districts, highlights how </p><p>Turkey\'s uneven economic gains in recent years have widened </p><p>the gap between the "haves" and "have-nots."  The modern </p><p>Istanbul-Ankara highway runs right through this conservative, </p><p>pious neighborhood, but with the nearest exit/on-ramp 15 </p><p>minutes away, Sultanbeyli residents are reminded that theirs </p><p>is a less privileged district.  Voters here have turned out </p><p>in large numbers to support successive Islam-oriented parties </p><p>and gave the Justice and Development (AK) Party over 53 </p><p>percent of the local vote in 2002 national elections. </p><p>Although support for AK currently remains strong, success in </p><p>future elections will also depend on whether the AK </p><p>government can deliver a locally popular </p><p>property-registration amnesty and long-term economic </p><p>development and opportunities.  End Summary and Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Less than thirty years ago, Sultanbeyli was a </p><p>sparsely populated rural area inland from the Bosphorus and </p><p>the Gulf of Izmit.  Massive immigration from Erzurum, Sivas, </p><p>and the Black Sea region made this one of the fastest-growing </p><p>districts in the country.  It was also widely known as one of </p><p>the most conservative and religious districts of Istanbul by </p><p>the mid-1990s.  Since becoming a district (ilce) in 1989, the </p><p>mayoralty has been held by Islamic-oriented Welfare (Refah), </p><p>Fazilet (Virtue), and Saadet (Felicity) party candidates. </p><p>Local residents confirm that as recently as five years ago, a </p><p>large percentage of the women wore not just headscarves, but </p><p>the full carsaf (chador).  The appointment of a dynamic </p><p>district governor and the increasingly pragmatic approach of </p><p>the mayor marked a shift that gave the district a more </p><p>moderate feel.  However, in the main, Sultanbeyli residents </p><p>remain conservative.  The imam at one of the town\'s largest </p><p>mosques claimed that the local mosques attract sizable crowds </p><p>for daily prayers and overflow with faithful on Fridays, </p><p>although it was impossible for us to have a free conversation </p><p>with him since the district mufti (representative of the </p><p>state\'s religious affairs directorate) showed up to monitor </p><p>the imam and dominate the conversation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Saadet Party Mayor Yahya Karakaya told poloffs that </p><p>the population growth had exceeded the district\'s ability to </p><p>extend municipal services.  Although immigration and growth </p><p>have tapered off, his principal challenges as mayor are to </p><p>expand the basic water, natural gas, and road infrastructure </p><p>to the full population.  Additionally, up to 75 percent of </p><p>Sultanbeyli residents lack building authorization and </p><p>property deeds, leading them to complain that they have no </p><p>protection or guarantees that they won\'t be evicted and/or </p><p>have their property confiscated.  Although there is some </p><p>local industry, Karakaya said, it does not go far in </p><p>providing local employment opportunities.  Unemployment is </p><p>high and is demonstrated by the fact that some of the 30,000 </p><p>unemployed line up daily along the main street hoping to find </p><p>day jobs with contractors looking for cheap labor.  Most of </p><p>those lucky enough to have full-time jobs must board buses </p><p>each morning for the hour-long journey to Mediyekoy, Sisli, </p><p>and other Istanbul European districts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Local politicians from several parties told visiting </p><p>poloffs that Sultanbeyli is a Justice and Development (AK) </p><p>Party stronghold.  Although the mayor is from rival Necmettin </p><p>Erbakan\'s Saadet Party, he, too, professed a deep admiration </p><p>for AKP Chairman Tayyip Erdogan and open support for the AK </p><p>government\'s policies because he sees them as reasonable, not </p><p>radical.  In the November 2002 elections, 53 percent of </p><p>Sultanbeyli voters turned out to support AK, compared to only </p><p>37 percent in Istanbul  as a whole.  Although no specific AKP </p><p>candidate has emerged, newly-elected local AK Party Chairman </p><p>Omer Ozkartal told poloffs that he expects the party to get </p><p>as much as 60 percent or more of the vote in the spring 2004 </p><p>municipal elections.  Local Republican People\'s Party (CHP) </p><p>officials made no effort to dismiss such claims.  In a sign </p><p>that he doesn\'t take such support for granted, however, </p><p>Ozkartal was quick to echo the mayor\'s call regarding the </p><p>need to push forward with a property amnesty and to note that </p><p>as long as the Istanbul-Ankara highway that bisects their </p><p>neighborhood merely passes them by, Sultanbeyli residents </p><p>will not be satisfied. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Staunchly "secularist" CHP reps acknowledged that </p><p>Sultanbeyli has moderated considerably from what they </p><p>described as an oppressively Islamist atmosphere until </p><p>several years ago.  More interested in a real exchange of </p><p>views with us than the more openly anti-American local CHP </p><p>organizations in other parts of the country, the reps </p><p>nevertheless displayed a strong conspiracy-theory approach in </p><p>peppering us with questions about U.S. intentions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The district chairman of Motorola deadbeat Cem </p><p>Uzan\'s Genc Party acknowledged that Genc would not win the </p><p>mayoral elections on its own, but might have a chance if it </p><p>combined with other parties under a unified candidate.  With </p><p>a portrait of Uzan, considered by a majority of Turks as </p><p>corruption personified, on the wall behind him, he went on to </p><p>criticize the widespread nature of corruption in Turkey. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
