<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002497 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, INR/EUC AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: HEIRS TO MONARCHY MAKE ROYAL MESS OF RETURN TO ROME </p><p> </p><p>(U)  This cable is Sensitive but Unclassified; not for </p><p>Internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY: The highly publicized "official" return </p><p>to Rome of the heirs to Italy\'s deposed monarchy was met </p><p>with indifference by most Romans.  The reaction within the </p><p>Jewish community, though, was anything but indifferent.  The </p><p>family sought, and received, high-profile meetings with </p><p>President Ciampi, PM Berlusconi and other symbols of the </p><p>Italian state while managing to overlook until the last </p><p>minute any outreach to a Jewish community that suffered </p><p>heavily during the monarchy\'s coexistence with Mussolini. </p><p>The Savoy\'s missteps were not particularly surprising, given </p><p>the family\'s tone-deafness to popular sentiment throughout </p><p>its long campaign for relief from its postwar exile.  But </p><p>the willingness of many of Italy\'s most senior political </p><p>figures to welcome the Savoys absent meaningful acts of </p><p>contrition to the Jewish community is somewhat more so.  It </p><p>would be possible -- and mistaken, in our view -- to </p><p>categorize the episode as evidence of rising anti-Semitism </p><p>in Italy, but the Jewish community here isn\'t drawing that </p><p>linkage.  Instead, it is concentrating on withholding any </p><p>sign of acceptance for the Savoys until the family steps </p><p>forward to close a painful chapter in Italian history.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The descendants of Italy\'s deposed royal household </p><p>-- Victor Emmanuel IV, son of the deposed king, and his wife </p><p>and son -- concluded May 19 their first "official" visit to </p><p>Rome (the third to Italy) since Parliament abolished the </p><p>constitutional provision preventing all male heirs to the </p><p>Savoy throne from setting foot in Italy.  Two prior visits </p><p>were built around an audience with the Pope and a visit to </p><p>Naples. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Although they insisted they were just average </p><p>citizens, the Savoys were received more in the manner of a </p><p>head of state, with calls on President Ciampi, Prime </p><p>Minister Berlusconi, Senate President Pera and Chamber </p><p>President Casini.  Their five-day program also included </p><p>prayers at the Pantheon tomb of Italy\'s first king and </p><p>visits to Monte Cassino monastery (where the Savoy family </p><p>archives were stored during the war) and to a war memorial </p><p>honoring fallen members of the first Italian military units </p><p>to fight with Allied forces.  In short, it was a schedule </p><p>heavy with symbolic stops designed simultaneously to </p><p>recognize the Savoy\'s role in Italy\'s creation and years as </p><p>its rulers, while also attempting to clean up the family\'s </p><p>tarnished image stemming from its coexistence with Mussolini </p><p>and subsequent flight from Rome when the regime collapsed in </p><p>1943. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Given this apparent emphasis on image </p><p>rehabilitation, it was all the more surprising that the </p><p>visit lacked any encounter with Italy\'s or Rome\'s Jewish </p><p>community.  Italian Jewish Union President Amos Luzzato told </p><p>the media he was disturbed by the Savoy\'s failure to reach </p><p>out to the Jewish community.  Luzzato deemed "insufficient" </p><p>Victor Emmanuel IV\'s comments last fall (in which he </p><p>described the Fascist-era racial laws against Jews, </p><p>implemented under the then-King\'s authority, as an </p><p>"indelible stain"), contrasting those cursory remarks with </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Fini\'s earlier thorough, contrite </p><p>repudiation of his  National Alliance Party\'s Fascist </p><p>predecessors. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  In reaction, the Savoys claimed to have sought a </p><p>meeting with Chief Rabbi Di Segni at the main synagogue </p><p>shortly before their arrival; it had never occurred to them </p><p>to contact Luzzatto as head of the Italian Jewish community. </p><p>The Savoys claimed they had been unable to contact the </p><p>synagogue earlier because they had lacked confirmation from </p><p>President Ciampi (although that does not appear to have </p><p>stopped the family and its supporters from making plans and </p><p>arrangements for other portions of their program).  Rabbi Di </p><p>Segni acknowledged receiving a call and fax the day of the </p><p>Savoy\'s arrival; the Rabbi said he had declined to meet with </p><p>the family, saying "it\'s too early for such an encounter." </p><p>Di Segni expressed his hope that such a meeting would occur, </p><p>but the Jewish Community felt that it should be preceded by </p><p>more concrete acts on the part of the Savoys to demonstrate </p><p>their contrition and to show a clear break from the past </p><p>behavior of the royal house. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  The Savoys added an impromptu visit to the </p><p>Ardeatine Caves in southern Rome, a mass grave site where </p><p>the Nazis executed 335 Italians, many of them Jews, in </p><p>retaliation for partisan attacks; the prince reportedly wept </p><p> </p><p>during the visit.  The visit sparked mixed reactions from </p><p>the Jewish community.  Prof. Luzzato welcomed it as another </p><p>useful, if insufficient, step towards full contrition, but </p><p>some families of the Jewish victims charged the visit </p><p>"profaned" the site. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  If exile taught the Savoys anything, it </p><p>did not include the value of savvy public relations. </p><p>At a minimum, they are guilty of gross insensitivity. </p><p>Whether this stems from indifference to, or willful </p><p>disregard of, their responsibilities as the representatives </p><p>of the former monarchy is unclear.  For all their talk of </p><p>just being "private citizens" ("call me Mr. Savoy," Victor </p><p>Emmanuel IV has said), the former royals appear to live in a </p><p>sheltered world of wealthy friends and royalist sympathizers </p><p>with little connection to the wider, democratic Italian </p><p>society they profess to hold dear.  They want it both ways -- </p><p>to have access to Italy and their wide circle of friends </p><p>here without coming completely to terms with the monarchy\'s </p><p>checkered role during the Fascist and wartime periods.  But </p><p>the Jewish community appears determined to prevent that from </p><p>happening and to ensure that the Savoys eventually speak to </p><p>the issue. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02497 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
