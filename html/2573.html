<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000528 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL/IRF, PRM (P.LEWIS) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECLASS 3/8/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, PGOV, PINS, SOCI, VM, CB, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS: WHAT DID WE </p><p>LEARN? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) HO CHI MINH CITY 00201, 00202, 00203 </p><p> </p><p>B) HO CHI MINH CITY 00039 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: EMI LYNN YAMAUCHI, CONSUL GENERAL, </p><p>REASON 1.5(D) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00528  01 OF 02  071026Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  DURING A 2.5-DAY VISIT TO DAK </p><p>LAK, GIA LAI, AND KON TUM PROVINCES, CONGENOFFS MET </p><p>WITH MONTAGNARD RETURNEES FROM CAMBODIA AND WITH </p><p>PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES.  REFTELS A ARE THE </p><p>DETAILED ACCOUNTS.  THESE ARE OUR CONCLUSIONS. ECONOMIC HARDSHIP </p><p>AND LAND DISPUTES SEEM TO BE THE PRIMARY REASONS WHY THIS GROUP </p><p>OF RETURNEES HAD LEFT.  WE FOUND THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES WELL-INTENTIONED ABOUT PROVIDING MATERIAL </p><p>SUPPORT TO THEIR RETURNEES, BUT WORRIED ABOUT </p><p>RESOURCES FOR THE LONG-TERM.  THERE WAS NO ATMOSPHERE </p><p>OF OVERT FEAR OR REPRESSION IN THE THREE VILLAGES WE </p><p>VISITED, NOR DID ANY RETURNEES CLAIM PHYSICAL </p><p>MISTREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) ECONOMICS, NOT RELIGION:  UNLIKE MANY OF </p><p>THOSE ETHNIC MINORITIES WHO FLED VIETNAM DURING SPRING </p><p>2001, WE BELIEVE THE RETURNEES WE MET LEFT PRIMARILY </p><p>FOR ECONOMIC REASONS.  THEY GREW COFFEE, COTTON, CORN, </p><p>AND CASSAVA, CROPS WHOSE PRICES HAD DIPPED OR WHICH </p><p>WERE NOT BIG MONEYMAKERS TO BEGIN WITH.  THE CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF DAK LAK\'S COMMITTEE ON RELIGION ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT THERE HAD BEEN COMPLAINTS ABOUT ECONOMIC HARDSHIP </p><p>IN THE VILLAGES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SOME VILLAGE LAND ALLOCATIONS WERE ON THE SMALL </p><p>SIDE - GIVEN LARGE FAMILY SIZE (5.5 CHILDREN AMONG </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES IN KON TUM).  WE HEARD ABOUT ONE </p><p>SPECIFIC LAND DISPUTE INVOLVING ETHNIC MINORITIES - AS </p><p>PLAINTIFFS, DEFENDANTS, AND CORRUPT LOCAL OFFICIALS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00528  01 OF 02  071026Z </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGE AND COMMUNE LEADERS "SOLD" </p><p>LAND BELONGING TO ANOTHER VILLAGER WITHOUT HIS </p><p>PERMISSION, AND ISSUED LAND-USE CERTIFICATES TO THE </p><p>NEW ETHNIC MINORITY OWNERS.  ACCORDING TO THE VILLAGER\'S WIFE, HE </p><p>LEFT FOR CAMBODIA WHEN HIS SECOND PETITION FOR A HEARING HAD GONE </p><p>UNANSWERED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) WE DO NOT BELIEVE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION WAS </p><p>THE REASON THESE VILLAGERS LEFT VIETNAM.   MOST OF THE </p><p>VILLAGERS WE MET DURING THE TRIP WERE PROTESTANTS (NOT </p><p>PARTICULARLY SURPRISING BECAUSE ETHNIC MINORITIES </p><p>COMPRISE A SIZEABLE PERCENTAGE OF PROTESTANT AND </p><p>CATHOLIC BELIEVERS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS), WHO </p><p>PRACTICED THEIR FAITH IN VARYING DEGREES.  THE </p><p>RETURNEES ANSWERED OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT RELIGION </p><p>MATTER-OF-FACTLY AND CALMLY.  RESIDENTS OF ONE VILLAGE </p><p>TOOK CONGENOFFS TO THEIR WORSHIP HOUSE.  ALL OF THE </p><p>PROTESTANT RETURNEES WE SPOKE TO SAID THEY WERE </p><p>ALLOWED TO PRACTICE THEIR FAITH, WITH ONE EXCEPTION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ONE RETURNEE SAID THAT IT WAS "DIFFICULT" FOR HIM TO </p><p>PRACTICE HIS FAITH BOTH BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE AND AFTER HIS </p><p>RETURN FROM CAMBODIA, BUT HE DID NOT/COULD NOT GIVE US </p><p>FURTHER DETAILS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) ARE THE RETURNEES/VILLAGERS AFRAID?: WE DID </p><p>NOT DETECT OVERT FEAR AMONG THE VILLAGERS.  SOME </p><p>TENSION AND CONFUSION AMONG THE RETURNEES, PERHAPS, AS </p><p>THEY WERE NOT CERTAIN WHY THEIR VILLAGE CHIEFS WERE </p><p>SUMMONING THEM TO MEETINGS.  WE SAW NO UNIFORMED </p><p>MILITARY OR SECURITY IN THE VILLAGES, AND PEOPLE WERE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00528  01 OF 02  071026Z </p><p>NOT LOOKING BACK OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AS THEY SPOKE </p><p>WITH US.  IN THE CASE OF THE GIA LAI RETURNEES, THEY </p><p>HAD BARELY BEEN BACK IN THEIR VILLAGES FOR 18 HOURS, </p><p>BEFORE THEY HAD TO PACK UP GAIN TO COME MEET WITH US. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) WE LOOKED FOR ANY SIGNS OF BEATINGS (LIMPS, </p><p>BRUISES, ETC.) ESPECIALLY ON ANY RETURNEES WHO WERE </p><p>WEARING SHORT-SLEEVED SHIRTS OR SHORTS.  WE DID NOT </p><p>SEE ANY.  THE ONLY VILLAGERS WHO CLAIMED PHYSICAL </p><p>ABUSE WERE THOSE WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN BEATEN IN THE </p><p>CAMBODIAN CAMP BY OTHER ETHNIC MINORITY REFUGEES, WHO </p><p>DID NOT WANT THEM TO RETURN TO VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) WHAT ABOUT THE ROLE OF PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS?: THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES </p><p>CONSIDER THEMSELVES KINGS OF THE HILL IN THEIR </p><p>PROVINCES.  IT WAS ONLY WITH PERSISTENT PRESSURE FROM </p><p>THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY AGREED TO MEET WITH </p><p>US.  IN THE WORDS OF ONE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, "EVEN IF </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTER HIMSELF CALLED ME, I STILL CALL </p><p>THE SHOTS."  THIS CHAIRMAN DID, IN THE END, AGREE TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2039 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00528  02 OF 02  071026Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------70C63C  071026Z /38 </p><p>O 071004Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5713 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BANGKOK </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 000528 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL/IRF, PRM (P.LEWIS) </p><p> </p><p>MEET WITH US.  THIS AND OTHER STATEMENTS LEAD US TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT PROVINCIAL, DISTRICT, COMMUNE AND </p><p>VILLAGE-LEVEL LEADERS PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN HOW </p><p>RETURNEES ARE TREATED - REGARDLESS OF INSTRUCTIONS </p><p>FROM THE GVN. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00528  02 OF 02  071026Z </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES INSISTED ON THEIR </p><p>GOOD INTENTIONS IN DEALING WITH ETHNIC MINORITY ISSUES. THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF DAK LAK\'S COMMITTEE ON RELIGION </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WHILE ETHNIC MINORITY POLICIES HAD </p><p>GOOD INTENTIONS, IMPLEMENTATION VARIED, AND IN SOME </p><p>INSTANCES "WAS NOT COMPLETE."  THAT IS AN </p><p>UNDERSTATEMENT.  WE DO NOT SEE HOW PROVINCIAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES ON DOWN (WITH A VERY SMALL TAX BASE - NO </p><p>LARGE CORPORATIONS TO TAX, NEXT TO NO FDI, AND ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY POPULATIONS MOSTLY EXEMPT FROM TAXES) CAN </p><p>LONG SUSTAIN THE SPECIAL ETHNIC MINORITY PROGRAMS THEY </p><p>OPERATE, LET ALONE IMPROVE THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING. </p><p>CURRENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS RUN THE GAMUT FROM MICRO- </p><p>LENDING TO SUSPENDING PAYMENTS ON LOANS TO </p><p>OUTRIGHT DONATIONS OF RICE, CLOTHING, SEEDS, AND CASH. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) LOCAL AUTHORITIES COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW THE </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES SPENT THE CASH ON "BOOZE AND BIKES", </p><p>BUT THEIR REAL WORRY WAS ELSEWHERE.  AT LEAST TWO </p><p>COMMUNE AND PROVINCIAL-LEVEL OFFICIALS SAID THEY DID </p><p>NOT KNOW IF THEY COULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT RETURNEE </p><p>FAMILIES IF THEIR FIELDS WERE NOT PLANTED BEFORE THE </p><p>RAINY SEASON BEGINS.  HAVING SEEN THE HARDSCRABBLE </p><p>EXISTENCE IN THESE VILLAGES, THAT RINGS TRUE. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) DAK LAK, GIA LAI, AND KON TUM PROVINCES ARE </p><p>AMONG THE POOREST IN VIETNAM.  DESPITE THE WONDERS OF </p><p>ELECTRICITY, TELEVISION, AND MOTORBIKES, THE VILLAGES </p><p>WE VISITED SEEM CUT OFF FROM EACH OTHER.  THEIR LIVES </p><p>ARE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY "60 METERS", IN THE WORDS OF ONE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00528  02 OF 02  071026Z </p><p>VILLAGE CHIEF. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THE EDUCATION LEVEL AMONG THE RETURNEES WE MET </p><p>WAS ANYWHERE FROM ZERO TO FOURTH GRADE.  THESE ARE NOT </p><p>STUPID PEOPLE, BUT THEIR SENSE OF TIME AND SPACE IS </p><p>VERY DIFFERENT FROM OURS.  THEIR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND </p><p>CONDITIONAL OR HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS IS ALMOST NON- </p><p>EXISTENT.  OR AT LEAST NON-EXISTENT IN THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>LANGUAGE.  LIKEWISE THEIR ABILITY TO ANALYZE OR ANSWER </p><p>"WHY".  SOME QUESTIONS HAD TO BE REPEATED, REFINED, </p><p>AND REDUCED TO THE MINIMUM. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) HOW USEFUL ARE THESE TRIPS TO THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS?: WE BELIEVE THESE TRIPS - EVEN WITHOUT </p><p>COMPLETE ACCESS OR PRIVACY - ARE WORTHWHILE.  WE </p><p>ACTUALLY SEE CONDITIONS IN THE VILLAGE, INTERACT WITH </p><p>RESIDENTS, AND EXPERIENCE THE REMOTENESS/ISOLATION </p><p>THAT CHARACTERIZE THEIR LIVES.  THIS GIVES US THE </p><p>CONTEXT IN WHICH TO JUDGE THE VARIOUS STORIES, RUMORS, </p><p>AND RHETORIC WE HEAR.  HOWEVER, OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS </p><p>THE VERACITY OF THE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN IS LIMITED, </p><p>GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN REFTELS A. </p><p>THEREFORE WE PREFER TO RELY ON THE "FRIENDS OF </p><p>FRIENDS" WHO TRAVEL DOWN FROM THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>THREE OR FOUR TIMES A YEAR - OR ON MINORITY CONTACTS </p><p>IN HCMC WHO HEAR THINGS FROM THEIR FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS?:  IF THE GVN AGREES TO MEET WITH </p><p>US, AMBASSADOR AND CONGEN PLAN TO TRAVEL TO THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS OVER EASTER. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00528  02 OF 02  071026Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
