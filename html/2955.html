<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001485 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ABUBAKAR RIMI IS COMING TO TOWN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 852 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 882 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 1068 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 1159 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During a May 3 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>PDP maverick and long-shot Presidential aspirant Mohammed </p><p>Abubakar Rimi claimed he had heard a rumor that the Embassy </p><p>was warning American visitors not to see him because of his </p><p>alleged ties to terrorism.  After the Ambassador dismissed </p><p>this misperception, the loquacious Presidential-hopeful got </p><p>off on another wrong track by requesting USG blessing of his </p><p>Presidential aspirations. The Ambassador told Rimi that we </p><p>were not in the business of endorsing Presidential candidates </p><p>in Nigeria, or elsewhere.  However, we were concerned that </p><p>the upcoming Presidential elections be as free, fair and </p><p>non-violent as possible.  Rimi plans to visit Washington, and </p><p>asked for our help in setting up meetings with USG officials. </p><p> Rimi\'s assistant Ujudud Shariff and PolMilOff sat in on the </p><p>meeting. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============= </p><p>NOT A BAD MAN </p><p>============= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Rimi explained he wanted to see the Ambassador to </p><p>counter a rumor that he, Rimi, had heard.  According to Rimi, </p><p>a source he would not name, had told him the Embassy was </p><p>warning AmCits not to meet with him, allegedly because Rimi </p><p>supported terrorism and Bin Laden.  Countering these stories </p><p>of his alleged anti-American leanings, Rimi stated strong </p><p>support for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, and condemned the </p><p>events of September 11.  The Ambassador assured Rimi that at </p><p>no time had the Embassy blacklisted him, nor did we have any </p><p>basis to question his opposition to terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>FACING OFF AGAINST OO </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Rimi then turned to the 2003 Presidential election. </p><p>Challenging Obasanjo for the PDP ticket, Rimi said that </p><p>Obasanjo had done little for development in the North while </p><p>projects in the South were numerous and moving forward. </p><p>Despite the resources Obasanjo was investing in the South, </p><p>Rimi predicted the President still could not claim much </p><p>support in his own home region in the Southwest.  According </p><p>to Rimi, the Southwest believed Awolowo had won the election </p><p>in 1979, but then military Head-of-State Obasanjo declared </p><p>the North\'s Shehu Shagari the winner.  Many Yoruba consider </p><p>this an act of ethnic treason.  Rimi also complained that </p><p>Obasanjo had put Yorubas into most of the senior security </p><p>services positions and the majority of Ministerial posts, an </p><p>affront to Northerners who had overwhelmingly supported him </p><p>in the 1999 election.  Rimi caviled that the Director General </p><p>of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) and the Director </p><p>General of the Federal Radio Commission of Nigeria (FRCN) had </p><p>joined Obasanjo\'s campaign publicity team, giving Obasanjo an </p><p>unfair media advantage over non-incumbents.  (COMMENT: In an </p><p>act of singular political ineptness that won Rimi support and </p><p>sympathy he otherwise would never have, FRCN pulled Rimi\'s </p><p>paid political announcements from the air earlier this year. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) When asked what he would do differently than Obasanjo </p><p>if he were President, Rimi said that first of all, he would </p><p>respect the constitution.  He contended President Obasanjo </p><p>had shown disregard for both the constitution and the </p><p>National Assembly.  Under a Rimi Presidency, consultation </p><p>with the legislature would be the watchword.  Moreover, </p><p>Obasanjo had spent vast sums on the ID card project and the </p><p>national stadium; in contrast, Rimi said that he would focus </p><p>on agricultural and industrial development.  (Rimi quoted </p><p>N10b and N30b, approximately USD100m and USD300m respectively </p><p>for the ID card and stadium.  In reality, the full cost of </p><p>stadium project is probably more than that.)  When asked </p><p>about privatization, Rimi, the Chairman of the Nigerian </p><p>Security Printing and Minting Company, which is on the block </p><p>to be privatized, dismissed the effort.  "Most parastatals </p><p>are profitable," he said, implying that that factor was </p><p>sufficient reason for maintaining state control despite the </p><p>inefficiencies and inability to deliver reliable and </p><p>affordable services characteristic of most parastatals. </p><p>(COMMENT:  By any commercial yardstick, most parastatals are </p><p>not profitable.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================ </p><p>BLESSINGS SOUGHT </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Rimi declared that he believed the U.S. would not </p><p>interfere in the elections, but he also "knew" the U.S. </p><p>supported Obasanjo in 1999.  Ambassador Jeter corrected Rimi, </p><p>making sure he did not leave the meeting still harboring this </p><p>perception.  The Ambassador unambiguously told him that the </p><p>US strongly backed the democratic process, but did not </p><p>endorse any particular candidate.  In any case, Rimi replied </p><p>that he "wished to come closer" to the USG, and planned to </p><p>travel to Washington soon and wanted to meet with some of our </p><p>officials.  "I want Washington to know me," he stated.  Rimi </p><p>then asked if the Embassy could help arrange meetings in </p><p>Washington for the first or second week of June with the </p><p>State Department, the CIA, and the White House ("President </p><p>Bush, if possible").  Ambassador Jeter replied that a meeting </p><p>with the President was not in the cards, however; calls at </p><p>State and the NSC might be possible.  Jeter also suggested </p><p>Rimi meet Nigerian-Americans while in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Rimi came looking for both "a rumor disclaimer" and </p><p>"an electoral nod."  We could give the former but Rimi almost </p><p>certainly knew that we could not and would not give the </p><p>latter.  This is not the first time Rimi has sought U.S. </p><p>support; during Abacha\'s phony transition, Rimi asked for </p><p>money to back his candidacy.  This unfortunate habit shows </p><p>his lack of understanding of the USG and his over-inflated </p><p>sense of his political gravity.  Articulate and capable of </p><p>energizing a crowd, Rimi makes good copy and is a favorite of </p><p>the press.  However, he is little more than a political </p><p>gadfly, known for his unguarded statements.  Rimi\'s chances </p><p>of upsetting President Obasanjo for the PDP nomination are </p><p>slim.  It is well known that Rimi is angry both about not </p><p>being given the Foreign Ministry and about not getting </p><p>lucrative contracts in return for his support to Obasanjo in </p><p>1999.  Although his candidacy has little chance of gaining </p><p>traction outside of the Kano area, Rimi has become a symbol </p><p>of strong opposition to Obasanjo in the North.  Rimi\'s </p><p>continued public sniping at the President will make it </p><p>difficult for Obasanjo to make inroads in this very key </p><p>region. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
