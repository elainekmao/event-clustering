<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000639 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SO, ET, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN SUPPORT FOR SOMALI PEACE INITIATIVES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 331 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL M C THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  BECAUSE OF ITALY\'S HISTORIC </p><p>TIES WITH SOMALIA AND ETHIOPIA, THE GOI IS PLAYING A STRONG </p><p>ROLE IN THE SOMALI PEACE PROCESS.  IT APPEARS TO SEE ITS ROLE </p><p>AS BOTH ENCOURAGING ALLIED STATES TO SUPPORT THE MOI-LED </p><p>RECONCILIATION EFFORT AND RECONCILING SOMALI-ETHIOPIAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00639  081628Z </p><p>TENSIONS.  THE MFA HAS INDICATED ITS CONCERN (REF A) THAT </p><p>ETHIOPIA COULD SPONSOR AGGRESSION AND FALSELY CLAIM TO BE </p><p>ACTING AT U.S. BEHEST.  REPORTS OF A GOI-SPONSORED PEACE </p><p>CONFERENCE ON FEB. 15 ARE SPURIOUS.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AT A MEETING FEB. 5 WITH MINISTER BRUNO CABRAS, </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN AFFAIRS AT THE MFA, </p><p>POST INQUIRED ABOUT A REPORT IN THE ITALIAN MEDIA OF A FEB. 8 </p><p>SOMALI OPPOSITION MEETING IN ROME, TO BE FOLLOWED BY A PEACE </p><p>CONFERENCE AMONG FACTION REPRESENTATIVES HERE FEB. 15. </p><p>CABRAS STATED THAT ANY SUCH MEETINGS WERE PRIVATE INITIATIVES </p><p>OF WHICH HE WAS NOT AWARE.  HE SUGGESTED THAT THE PRESS HAD </p><p>INCORRECTLY DESCRIBED AN EVENT ACTUALLY PLANNED FOR FEB. 15: </p><p>AN MFA ROUNDTABLE ON SOMALIA FOR EUROPEAN EXPERTS AND </p><p>ACADEMICS, NOT SOMALI OPPOSITION FIGURES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CABRAS INFORMED EMBOFFS THAT THE GOI WAS PLANNING A </p><p>SOMALIA PEACE INITIATIVE, BUT THAT IT WOULD BE COMPLEMENTARY </p><p>TO THE PLANNED NAIROBI PEACE CONFERENCE AND COORDINATED WITH </p><p>RELEVANT PLAYERS, INCLUDING THE USG.  THE GOI WOULD NOT DO </p><p>ANYTHING TO HARM THE NAIROBI PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ASKED ABOUT A RECENT ROUNDTABLE ON SOMALIA IN WHICH </p><p>TWO FORMER GOI OFFICIALS CALLED FOR A SOMALI PEACE CONFERENCE </p><p>TO BE HELD IN ROME INSTEAD OF NAIROBI, CABRAS STATED THAT </p><p>THESE INDIVIDUALS SIDED WITH A PRO-ETHIOPIAN FACTION.  THIS </p><p>GROUP PREFERRED A MEETING THAT WOULD DISCUSS ONLY TERRORISM, </p><p>THEREBY DISCREDITING SOMALIA\'S TRANSITIONAL NATIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  CABRAS SAID HE HAD SHARED THE MFA\'S VIEW--THAT </p><p>THIS WAS A MISUSE OF THE TERRORISM ISSUE--WITH DEPARTMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS RECENTLY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00639  081628Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) A FEB. 7 MFA PRESS RELEASE REPORTED THAT MFA UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY ALFREDO MANTICA HAD MET THAT DAY WITH A SOMALI </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DELEGATION HEADED BY OSMAN JAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE MIXED </p><p>COMMISSION (ADMINISTRATION-PARLIAMENT) FOR NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION.  THE PURPOSE OF THE ENCOUNTER WAS TO DISCUSS </p><p>THE SOMALI PEACE PROCESS AND ITALY\'S ROLE IN IT.  "THIS </p><p>MEETING INITIATES AN INTENSE SERIES OF MEETINGS THROUGH WHICH </p><p>THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH THE VARIOUS </p><p>SOMALI PARTIES INTERESTED IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS," MANTICA SAID.  "ITALY\'S INITIATIVE, ALTHOUGH </p><p>INDEPENDENT, COMPLEMENTS THE IGAD PROCESS ... IN ORDER TO </p><p>SUPPORT IT AND ENSURE ITS SUCCESS....  ITALY IS READY TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE POLITICAL SUPPORT NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE </p><p>REALIZATION OF INTRA-SOMALI DIALOGUE."  ECHOING POINTS MADE </p><p>IN PREVIOUS POST DISCUSSIONS WITH MFA, THE PRESS RELEASE ALSO </p><p>NOTED, "WE CONSIDER INDISPENSABLE THE WIDEST POSSIBLE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF ALL SOMALI FACTIONS AT THE UPCOMING </p><p>CONFERENCE IN NAIROBI, AND WE HOPE THAT THE TRANSITIONAL </p><p>NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND ALL RELEVANT PARTIES COLLABORATE </p><p>CLOSELY WITH KENYAN PRESIDENT MOI IN HIS COORDINATION EFFORTS </p><p>..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) A FEB. 5 ARTICLE IN THE ITALIAN DAILY LA STAMPA </p><p>STATED THAT MANTICA HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A VISIT TO THE </p><p>HORN OF AFRICA, WHERE HE MET MOI AND THE REPRESENTATIVES OF </p><p>THE EIGHT WARRING SOMALI FACTIONS.  MANTICA IS QUOTED AS </p><p>SAYING THAT SOMALIA SHOULD SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY THE PEACE </p><p>CONFERENCE PRESENTS BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE, BECAUSE IT RISKS </p><p>BECOMING ANOTHER AFGHANISTAN.  MANTICA EMPHASIZED THE GOI\'S </p><p>READINESS TO WORK WITH ETHIOPIA, WITH WHOM IT SHARES HISTORIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00639  081628Z </p><p>TIES, TO SMOOTH OVER ANY IRRITANTS IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>SOMALIA.  ITALY WOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO INVOLVE THE EU IN </p><p>ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL COMMITMENTS TOWARD PEACE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00639 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
