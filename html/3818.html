O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  Zimbabwe\'s Economy: Hardly a Pulse </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Robert Mugabe\'s government continues an </p><p>assault on macroeconomics and private property.  Without </p><p>credible monetary and exchange policy, the country will </p><p>only plunge more deeply into recession.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>5 Years of Ruinous Policy </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) Consider these ominous indicators: </p><p> </p><p>                         1998      2002 (est)     change </p><p>                         ----      ----------     ------ </p><p>Real GDP (US$ billions)    6.3         4.1        -  35% </p><p>Arrears (US$ millions)    95       1,635          +1700% </p><p>FDI (US$ millions)       444           3          -  99% </p><p>M3 (Z$ billions)          57         495          + 870% </p><p>(broad money supply) </p><p> </p><p>The numbers, which fluctuate considerably due to </p><p>methodology, tell the story of a breathtaking 5-year </p><p>tumble, exacerbated by external shocks but brought about </p><p>by economic mismanagement. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In fact, the government has snubbed macroeconomic </p><p>solutions at every turn.  It has: </p><p> </p><p>- expanded money supply aggressively to cover a widening </p><p>revenue/expenditure gap. </p><p>- instituted price controls. </p><p>- cut interest on short-term bonds to one-fourth the </p><p>inflation rate. </p><p>- raided private pension funds by compelling them to buy </p><p>these money-losing securities. </p><p>- maintained an official exchange that is now just one- </p><p>thirteenth the parallel rate. </p><p>- fired Finance Minister Simba Makoni, a rare official </p><p>voice for spending cuts and devaluation. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The results are unsurprising.  Monetary expansion </p><p>caused rampant inflation (currently at 135 percent by </p><p>official estimates).  Price controls triggered shortages, </p><p>cosmetic repackaging and black-market profiteering.  Low </p><p>interest on bonds drove investors into equity and housing </p><p>markets, which are in turn booming. Pension funds </p><p>reluctantly underwrote government spending and debt </p><p>servicing, depleting the country\'s overall savings (down </p><p>from 25 to 7 percent of GDP since 1997) and impoverishing </p><p>future retirees.  And the preposterous official exchange </p><p>has strangled much private sector activity - and sparked </p><p>innumerable rent-seeking schemes. </p><p> </p><p>An Opportunity Lost for Export-Driven Growth </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) Tragically, the country has failed to make use of </p><p>its weak currency, a formidable trade advantage, even vis- </p><p>a-vis the depreciated South African rand.  Falling </p><p>exports have kept current accounts in deficit.  Efforts </p><p>to soften the currency burden on exporters - through </p><p>lower lending rates and partial devaluations for export </p><p>earnings - have made little difference.  Over 80 percent </p><p>of commercial activity already takes place at the </p><p>parallel rate.  Yet companies risk sanction for parallel </p><p>market conversions and often halt production rather than </p><p>submit to the official rate.  The government has also </p><p>increased licensing fees for exchange agents by 10-fold, </p><p>adding another cost to the export sector. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (SBU) We see no prospect of recovery without a </p><p>sweeping policy overhaul.  Monetary growth, runaway </p><p>spending, price controls and the official exchange rate </p><p>all pound away at GDP.  As it stands, the government is </p><p>forecasting a further 5 percent retraction in 2003 while </p><p>private economists expect 5-10 percent.  The 10-percent </p><p>worst-case scenario would make for a cumulative 41 </p><p>percent real GDP decline by the close of 2003. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) To climb out of this deepening pit, the country </p><p>will need a stable business climate, tighter monetary </p><p>control and plausible exchange regime.  The government </p><p>will have to broadly cut spending (deficit is now over 15 </p><p>percent of GDP) and overcome its ideological disdain for </p><p>private property. (At present, the government is not even </p><p>willing to issue titles on the expropriated farmland it </p><p>is doling out to supporters.)  By selling off </p><p>underperforming parastatals, it would raise needed forex </p><p>to service external arrears.  Such a change in policy </p><p>would give the GoZ leverage to resume dialogue with the </p><p>World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and seek </p><p>better access for exports to the U.S. and Europe.  While </p><p>the above scenario - or some variation - may be </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s eventual recovery scenario, its enactment is </p><p>nowhere on the horizon. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
