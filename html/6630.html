<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001810 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY MARCH 21: STEADY DETERIORATION </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Start to Re-focus on IMF Program, </p><p>Await GOT Action </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On the morning of March 21, foreign investors were </p><p>selling both Turkish stocks and Turkish Eurobonds.  Lehman </p><p>Bros Turkey analyst told us rumors of a Moody\'s downgrade of </p><p>the Turkish sovereign debt is motivating some Eurobond </p><p>selling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira depreciated one percent in the morning to TL 1, </p><p>720,000 to the dollar. </p><p>--  The benchmark lira T-bill is currently trading at 68 </p><p>percent compounded (up from 66.5 percent at yesterday\'s </p><p>close). </p><p>--  The Turkish 30-year maturity Eurobond is trading at about </p><p>1000 basis points wide of U.S. Treasuries (from 815 basis </p><p>points on March 19). </p><p>-- The Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index closed down 6 </p><p>percent in morning trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Comment:  With foreign investors increasingly </p><p>selling out of Turkish stocks and Eurbonds (they are already </p><p>out of the local T-bill market), it will be hard for the GOT </p><p>to complain about "hot money" speculators (they\'ll wish they </p><p>had some). </p><p>Local investors now fully control the markets.  According to </p><p>bond and stock traders, the local investors were not happy to </p><p>hear the morning TV news that the GOT is still negotiating </p><p>with the U.S. on overflight rights (i.e., further reducing </p><p>prospects of any U.S. aid).  Locals are re-focusing their </p><p>hopes for an optimistic scenario based now on two elements: </p><p>a short war in Iraq (with smaller tourism and trade effects </p><p>on Turkey);  and quick GOT action to complete the Fourth IMF </p><p>Review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Budget Update </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) A key prior action under the IMF Fourth Review is </p><p>passage of the full-year 2003 budget, which must in any case </p><p>be adopted by April 1.  According to Finance Ministry Deputy </p><p>DG Ahmet Kesik, the current plan is for parliamentary floor </p><p>debate to begin on Sunday, March 23 and finish five days </p><p>later on Friday, March 28.  President Sezer will then have </p><p>until Monday, March 31 to ratify the budget law (though the </p><p>Constitution gives the President up to 10 days to take action </p><p>on legislation). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Kesik told us there is one potential problem for </p><p>the 2003 budget.  Two new revenue raising measures - on motor </p><p>vehicles and real estate - are contained in separate bills </p><p>stuck in the parliament\'s Budget and Planning Commission. </p><p>Parliament must pass those bills quickly as well, to avoid </p><p>exacerbating existing serious concerns on budget financing. </p><p>Kesik said the GOT plans to limit pass the bills out of the </p><p>Budget and Planning Commission on March 28. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rising Inflationary Expectations </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The Central Bank publishes twice monthly a survey of </p><p>expectations regarding forward-looking inflation.  On March </p><p>21, the Central Bank published its second survey taken in </p><p>March.  It shows a steady increase in average expectations </p><p>for year-end Consumer Price Index inflation.  In February the </p><p>expectations remained at 25 percent, while now they are 27 </p><p>percent (the GOT target is 20 percent). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
