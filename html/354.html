<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KHARTOUM 03292 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INR/B AND DS/TAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINR, OFDP, PREL, LY, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  LIBYAN PRESENCE IN SUDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 62856, B) KHARTOUM 2849, C) KHARTOUM 2428, </p><p>D) KHARTOUM 1749, E) KHARTOUM 2825, F) 89 KHARTOUM 10663 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AT THIS TIME, LIBYAN PRESENCE IN SUDAN IS DIFFICULT </p><p>TO ESTIMATE PRECISELY, BUT OVERT LIBYAN OPERATIONS APPEAR </p><p>LIMITED.  LIBYAN ARAB AIRLINES (LAA) FLIES TO KHARTOUM </p><p>FROM TRIPOLI ONCE A WEEK AND MAINTAINS A SMALL KHARTOUM </p><p>STAFF.  THE LIBYAN ARAB FOREIGN INVESTMENT CO. (LAFICO) </p><p>AND THE LIBYAN SUDANESE CO. (LASCO), BOTH HOLDING </p><p>COMPANIES, ALSO MAINTAIN OFFICES IN KHARTOUM.  LAFICO </p><p>BEGAN OPERATIONS ABOUT 1981 AND LASCO ABOUT 1985; BOTH </p><p>HAVE LITTLE OVERT ACTIVITY.  IN ADDITION, THE LIBYAN-ARAB </p><p>HOLDING CO., A FRONT ORGANIZATION WHOSE OVERT ACTIVITIES </p><p>INVOLVE AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENTS, HAS A KHARTOUM BRANCH. </p><p>LIBYAN-SUDANESE ECONOMIC AND TRADE RELATIONS ARE DETAILED </p><p>IN REF B.  AS STATED IN REF D, LIBYA IS NOW SUDAN\'S ONLY </p><p>RELIABLE SOURCE OF PETROLEUM AND THE ONLY COUNTRY WILLING </p><p>TO SELL TO THE GOS ON CREDIT, FOR WHICH LIBYA WILL </p><p>INCREASINGLY DEMAND PAYMENT IN POLITICAL CURRENCY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE FRONT GROUP "ISLAMIC CALL" IS CONSIDERABLY MORE </p><p>ACTIVE THAN THE LIBYAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS, WITH </p><p>OFFICES IN THE KHARTOUM DISTRICTS OF NEW EXTENSION AND </p><p>RIYADH.  ALTHOUGH NO DETAILS ON STAFF ARE AVAILABLE, BOTH </p><p>OFFICES ENGAGE IN PROPAGANDA ACTIVITIES AND RECEIVE </p><p>NUMEROUS SUDANESE VISITORS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE LIBYAN EMBASSY (CALLED THE "LIBYAN ARAB </p><p>BROTHERHOOD BUREAU") IN KHARTOUM HAS AN OFFICIAL STAFF OF </p><p>20 DIPLOMATS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE VERY UNSPECIFIC TITLES. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR (CALLED THE "SECRETARY GENERAL"), RAMADHAN </p><p>ALI BASHIR, A DEAD RINGER FOR QADHAFI, ARRIVED JANUARY </p><p>29.  NO BIOGRAPHIC DETAILS ON BROTHERHOOD BUREAU STAFF </p><p>ARE AVAILABLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  AMONG THE BROTHERHOOD BUREAU\'S ACTIVITIES REPORTEDLY </p><p>IS SUPERVISION OF LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES IN SUDAN </p><p>(REF E).  ALTHOUGH FEW DETAILS ABOUT THE OPERATIVES ARE </p><p>AVAILABLE, THEY REPORTEDLY ARE NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE </p><p>BECAUSE THEY RELY TOO HEAVILY ON MONEY AS AN INDUCEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  FOR SOME YEARS LIBYA HAS MAINTAINED AN AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PROJECT AT SAQ AL NA\'AM NEAR EL FASHER IN DARFUR WITH 10 </p><p>TO 15 LIBYAN STAFF.  THE PROJECT IS OVERTLY ENGAGED IN </p><p>AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SEED TESTING, BUT IT </p><p>IS REPORTEDLY STAFFED BY LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES </p><p>COMMANDED BY A COLONEL WITH A DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS LINK </p><p>TO TRIPOLI.  THE PROJECT REPORTEDLY HAS BEEN USED TO </p><p>FUNNEL AID TO CHADIAN REBELS IN DARFUR, ALTHOUGH NO </p><p>LIBYAN REGULAR ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN DARFUR </p><p>SINCE 1986.  PROVISIONS FOR INCREASED AGRICULTURAL TRADE </p><p>BETWEEN SUDAN AND LIBYA IN RECENT AGREEMENTS SUGGEST THAT </p><p>SUCH PROJECTS MAY BECOME MORE COMMON. </p><p> </p><p>7.  FEW LIBYAN MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE EVIDENT IN THE </p><p>KHARTOUM AREA.  REPORTS SUGGEST SOME LIBYAN MILITARY </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE WESTERN PROVINCE OF DARFUR, WHERE LIBYA </p><p>REPORTEDLY SUPPORTS CHADIAN REBELS UNDER IDRISS DEBY. </p><p>LIBYA ALSO MAINTAINS OFFICIAL CONTACT WITH THE SUDANESE </p><p>MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.  IN ADDITION TO ITS ROLE AS SUDAN\'S </p><p>PRINCIPAL SUPPLIER OF OIL (AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF </p><p>WHICH GOES TO THE SUDANESE MILITARY), LIBYA HAS FOR SOME </p><p>YEARS BEEN ONE OF SUDAN\'S MOST IMPORTANT ARMS SUPPLIERS. </p><p>UNDER THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT OF SADIQ AL MAHDI, THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES ESTABLISHED A MILITARY PROTOCOL UNDER WHICH </p><p>LIBYA PROVIDED SUDAN WITH MIG-23 AIRCRAFT, BOMBS, </p><p>AMMUNITION, OTHER EQUIPMENT, AND TRAINING.  LIBYAN PILOTS </p><p>ALSO FLEW AIRSTRIKES AGAINST THE SUDAN PEOPLE\'S </p><p>LIBERATION ARMY (SPLA), A PRACTICE NOW REPORTEDLY </p><p>DISCONTINUED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN EARLY 1989, SOME 20 IL-76 TRANSPORT FLIGHTS </p><p>BROUGHT MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM LIBYA TO SUDAN.  TEN SUCH </p><p>FLIGHTS (CARRYING AMMUNITION, ROCKETS FOR USE ON </p><p>JEEP-TYPE VEHICLES, AND BOMBS) REPORTEDLY ARRIVED IN </p><p>KHARTOUM BETWEEN NOVEMBER 28 AND DECEMBER 5, 1989.  THESE </p><p>FLIGHTS CONTINUE AT THE RATE OF TWO A WEEK.  SIX LIBYAN </p><p>TECHNICIANS REPORTEDLY ARE STATIONED AT THE WADI SIEDNA </p><p>AIRBASE TO MAINTAIN THE MIG-23\'S, AND LIBYA REPORT (#) </p><p>A FOUR-YEAR PROGRAM OF UNITY WITH LIBYA.  THE AGREEMENT </p><p>CALLS FOR UNIFICATION IN THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, CULTURAL, </p><p>AND SECURITY SPHERES.  IT ALSO ALLOWS SUDANESE AND LIBYAN </p><p>NATIONALS TO TRAVEL WITHOUT VISAS BETWEN SUDAN AND LIBYA, </p><p>WHICH HAS PRODUCED AN UNDETERMINABLE INCREASE IN THE </p><p>NUMBER OF LIBYANS IN SUDAN.  THE SUDAN SECURITY SERVICE </p><p>HAS ALSO VOICED COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS OVER </p><p>"UNDOCUMENTED LIBYANS" IN THE KHARTOUM AREA. </p><p> </p><p>10.  AS A RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT, THE GOS HELD A </p><p>CONVENTION MARCH 24-26 OF SOME 1,600 PEOPLE, MOSTLY </p><p>SUDANESE INVOLVED IN PREVIOUS GOS CONFERENCES, TO PROVIDE </p><p>A SHOW OF POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE INTEGRATION PROJECT. </p><p>QADHAFI WAS SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS THE CLOSING RALLY OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE, BUT, DESPITE SEVERAL PRESS REPORTS TO </p><p>CONTRARY, DID NOT ARRIVE IN KHARTOUM.  LIBYAN DEFENCE </p><p>MINISTER ABU BAKR YUNIS ADDRESSED THE RALLY ALONG WITH </p><p>SUDAN\'S HEAD OF STATE, GENERAL OMAR AL-BASHIR.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO MISSION FSN WHO ATTENDED, 50,000 TO 70,000 SUDANESE </p><p>PARTICPATED IN THE HOUR-LONG RALLY WHICH REPEATED WELL </p><p>WORN EXHORTATIONS TO AND PRAISE FOR ARAB UNITY, THE </p><p>CORNERSTONE OF WHICH IS NOW THE INTEGRATION OF SUDAN AND </p><p>LIBYA.  (SEPTEL ON THE RALLY FOLLOWS). </p><p> </p><p>11.  AS A RESULT OF THE INTEGRATION AGREEMENT AND THE </p><p>CONFERENCE THERE IS A MUCH GREATER AND MORE OBVIOUS </p><p>LIBYAN PRESENCE IN KHARTOUM.  THE SITUATION, HOWEVER, IS </p><p>TOO MUCH IN FLUX AT THE MOMENT TO PERMIT A CLEAR </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE UNITY </p><p>AGREEMENT.  MOST OBSERVERS, INCLUDING SEVERAL ARAB </p><p>AMBASSADORS AND THE CHADIAN AMBASSADOR, DO NOT EXPECT </p><p>MUCH MORE THAN RHETORIC.  IN THE SHORT TERM, HOWEVER, THE </p><p>LIBYANS ARE HERE IN STRENGTH, MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF THE </p><p>MILITARY AND OTHER MORE MODERATE SECTORS OF SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  REPORTS OF SUDANESE MILITARY DISENCHANTMENT WITH THE </p><p>LIBYAN UNION HAVE CIRCULATED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  THE ARREST OF SOME TWENTY RETIRED AND </p><p>ACTIVE DUTY OFFICERS MARCH 25 (SEPTEL) FOR COUP PLOTTING </p><p>REPORTEDLY FOLLOWED THEIR AGREEMENT TO MOVE ON A SPECIFIC </p><p>DATE, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF OPPOSITION TO LIBYAN </p><p>INTEGRATION.  HOW EFFECTIVE THE ARRESTS ULTIMATELY PROVE </p><p>TO BE IN KEEPING THE SOLDIERS IN BARRACKS IS STILL NOT </p><p>CLEAR.  WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT SUDAN\'S ARMED FORCES ARE </p><p>UNHAPPY WITH THIS RELATIONSHIP.  GENERAL OMAR, WITH A WAR </p><p>IN THE SOUTH AND A DISENCHANTED MILITARY WILL BE AN </p><p>INCREASINGLY WARY AND NERVOUS CHIEF OF STATE.  HIS </p><p>DEPENDENCE ON LIBYA WILL PROVIDE SMALL CONSOLATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: (#) OMISSION. CORRECTION TO FOLLOW. </p><p></p></div>
