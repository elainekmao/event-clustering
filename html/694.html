THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED </p><p>     DIPLOMATIC NOTES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN FEBRUARY </p><p>     AND MAY 1994 PROTESTING THE ALLEGED "IMPUNITY" WITH </p><p>     WHICH ANTI-CUBA TERRORIST GROUPS ARE PERMITTED TO </p><p>     OPERATE IN U.S. TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>(B)  POST HAS NO INFORMATION REGARDING ANY EXTRADITION, </p><p>     OR REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION, TO CUBA OF SUSPECTED </p><p>     TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>(C)  CLOSE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN CUBA AND OTHER </p><p>     COUNTRIES WHICH SPONSOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>     COULD IMPEDE CUBAN GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR </p><p>     EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>(D)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER CUBAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>     ACTIONS TO CONDEMN OR INVESTIGATE TERRORIST ACTS. </p><p>(E)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>     EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1994 BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>(F)  CUBAN GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>     TERRORISM HAS DECLINED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL </p><p>     YEARS.  THE EVER DEEPENING ECONOMIC CRISIS FACING </p><p>     CUBA HAS REDUCED THE RESOURCES PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE </p><p>     TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.
