<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 002147 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  11-19-12 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 162 (11-19-02) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Wills, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  JAPAN\'S YOSIKAWA VISITS KILINOCHI </p><p>           GL PEIRIS ON BALASINGHAM\'S WISH TO VISIT NORTH </p><p>           NORTH AMERICA </p><p> MORAGODA-DEPSEC TV INTERVIEW IN OSLO? </p><p>           DEALING WITH THE LTTE </p><p>           DRAFT PRESS GUIDANCE:  OK TO USE? </p><p>           ICC WAIVER </p><p> </p><p>Japan\'s Yosikawa Visit\'s Kilinochi </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) The Japanese Ambassador rang the Ambassador </p><p>last night to report on his and Mr. Yosikawa\'s attendance </p><p>at the first Subcommittee meeting on North-East </p><p>Reconstruction.  The atmosphere was "positive and </p><p>friendly" but the details of how the Subcommittee and </p><p>related North-East Reconstruction Fund -- NERF -- will </p><p>work are still unclear.  Ambassador Otsuka said he and </p><p>Yosikawa told the LTTE that donors needed maximal </p><p>flexibility to implement programs and donate funds but he </p><p>wasn\'t sure the LTTE got it.  There apparently will be a </p><p>Secretariat for the Subcommittee -- bureaucracies do </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>indeed proliferate -- staffed with an LTTE Director and </p><p>two Deputy Directors, one from the GSL and one </p><p>representing "minorities."  The Japanese role in the </p><p>Subcommittee has been defined as "Principal Advisor", so </p><p>that will be Mr. Akashi\'s title.  Akashi, by the way, </p><p>will be coming to the Oslo meeting. (FO) </p><p> </p><p>Peiris on Balasingham\'s Wish to Visit North America </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador lunched with GL at Parliament on </p><p>Saturday.  Among many other topics discussed, GL raised a </p><p>"sensitive" matter relating to the LTTE\'s Anton </p><p>Balasingham.  It seems Balasingham wants to visit Canada </p><p>and the US to "consult with the diaspora."  The </p><p>Ambassador replied that Milinda had raised this with the </p><p>DepSec in September and had been told the USG would check </p><p>into it.  EAW added that the checking was still going on </p><p>but was unlikely to lead to approval for a Balasingham </p><p>visit to the US until the Tigers are much closer to </p><p>coming off the FTO than they are now (the Ambassador </p><p>actually said - with typically mellifluous southern </p><p>elegance - "that dog don\'t hunt".  Peiris related that he </p><p>had raised this possibility with the Canadian Foreign </p><p>Minister when he was in Ottawa last month.  The Foreign </p><p>Minister replied that Canada would be willing to let in </p><p>Balasingham but was concerned lest its population think </p><p>the GOC and the USG have different approaches to FTO\'s. </p><p>According to Peiris, the Canadian asked the GSL to </p><p>intervene with the USG to give a signal to Ottawa that we </p><p>don\'t mind if the Canadians give Balasingham a visa.  The </p><p>Ambassador said he would pass this along to Washington. </p><p>SA may want to alert the DepSec to the possibility the </p><p>GOC may be raising this with him directly.  (FO) </p><p> </p><p>Moragoda-Depsec TV Interview in Oslo? </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Milinda rang the Ambassador from Tokyo to find </p><p>out whether he can do his long-sought TV interview with </p><p>the Depsec while they are in Olso next week.  Can SA </p><p>please check with Kara B to get an answer?  (FO) </p><p> </p><p>DEALING WITH THE LTTE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We would urge a clear authoritative edict prior to </p><p>Oslo from the lawyers at Justice on precisely what </p><p>dealings US officials may have with the LTTE.  (FO) </p><p> </p><p>DRAFT PRESS GUIDANCE:  OK TO USE? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Is the "if-asked" press guidance we provided in </p><p>Colombo 2142 OK for us to use (if asked, natch)? </p><p>(FO) </p><p> </p><p>ICC WAIVER </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) MFA is closed today for a local holiday.  We </p><p>will get hold of the ForSec tomorrow and make sure we are </p><p>all working off the same ICC waiver text and set up a </p><p>signing event ASAP. (FO) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
