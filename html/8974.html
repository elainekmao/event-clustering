<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001797 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR MELLE, CHANDLER, BALASSA, BURCKY AND SCHNARE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/BTA AND WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>DOC FOR ITA/MAC -- OFFICE OF NAFTA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, SCUL, CA </p><p>SUBJECT:  WHAT IS CANADIAN?  GOC REVIEWS ITS DEFINITION OF </p><p>       "CANADIAN CONTENT" IN FILM AND TV PRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p>REF:   02 OTTAWA 922 </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION:  Canada applies various tests to </p><p>define "Canadian content" of entertainment products, in </p><p>order to make funding decisions and to enforce broadcast </p><p>content requirements.  On June 17, the GOC announced results </p><p>of a year-long review (reftel) of the definition of </p><p>"Canadian content" as it applies to film and television </p><p>production.  While the resulting recommendations suggest </p><p>numerous changes, they broadly support the GOC\'s overall </p><p>approach to cultural policy.  They stress that "Canadian </p><p>content can be created only by Canadians."  They also </p><p>propose that the current "points/expenditure system" - under </p><p>which Canadian content is determined by a formula based </p><p>partly on the nationality of key creative personnel - be </p><p>replaced by a co-called "creative expenditure model."  END </p><p>SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p>2.   THE CURRENT REGIME:  As a condition of license, </p><p>Canadian radio and television broadcasters are required to </p><p>fill certain percentages of their broadcast schedules with </p><p>"Canadian" programming.  Key public sector film and TV </p><p>funding bodies, Telefilm Canada and the Canadian Film and </p><p>Television Production Fund (CFTPF), are mandated to support </p><p>distinctively "Canadian" productions.  The GOC\'s Canadian </p><p>Film or Video Production Tax Credit (CPTC) is also designed </p><p>to support production of "Canadian" content. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE RULES:  Telefilm Canada and the Canadian Audio-Visual </p><p>Certification Office (CAVCO) apply specific rules to </p><p>determine whether a given production is Canadian for </p><p>purposes of GOC funding and tax credits.  These rules are </p><p>based on the nationality of key creative personnel </p><p>(director, screenwriter, key actors, etc.) and on a minimum </p><p>(75 percent) of production costs being paid to Canadian </p><p>entities.  The Canadian Radio-Television and </p><p>Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the broadcast </p><p>regulator, applies similar rules to determine whether a </p><p>production is Canadian for purposes of meeting TV </p><p>broadcasting quotas. </p><p> </p><p>4.   THE PROBLEM:  Critics have pointed out for years that </p><p>these rules do not truly govern content; they implicitly </p><p>assume that what Canadian personnel produce will be </p><p>"Canadian content."  As one columnist recently wrote, "the </p><p>requisite number of Canadians may be employed, but the film </p><p>itself may be about American tourists eating Japanese food </p><p>in Bangladesh. . . . And why should it be preferred to a </p><p>film made by Americans of a Canadian story, as in `The </p><p>Shipping News\' [a film set in Newfoundland starring U.S. </p><p>actors]?"  With Canada now the site of a large amount of </p><p>U.S.-financed and/or internationally co-produced film and </p><p>television, the rules have become somewhat harder to apply. </p><p>Moreover, such questions about what is (or should be) </p><p>considered Canadian are not only more culturally </p><p>problematic, but also of growing economic/commercial </p><p>importance. </p><p> </p><p>5.   POLICY CONTEXT:  Post predicted a year ago (reftel) </p><p>that the GOC review, while potentially useful, would likely </p><p>not tackle important larger issues about the relevance of </p><p>Canadian cultural policy measures.  In many cases, Canada\'s </p><p>media/entertainment industries today are vastly more </p><p>prosperous, successful and dynamic than they were when these </p><p>policies were first formulated.  As expected, the results of </p><p>the GOC "Canadian content" review are framed within the </p><p>broader status quo of Canadian cultural policy and are meant </p><p>to reinforce it.  In fairness, it bears noting that some </p><p>wider issues in cultural policy have been addressed recently </p><p>by Parliamentary committees - such as the House Industry </p><p>Committee\'s recent study of foreign ownership restrictions </p><p>in telecommunications, and the House Heritage Committee\'s </p><p>examination of the state of Canadian broadcasting (see </p><p>website parl.gc.ca under "committee business").  However, we </p><p>see little prospect of these studies leading to actual </p><p>changes in policy. </p><p> </p><p>6.   RECOMMENDATIONS:  The results of the "Canadian content" </p><p>review are available at website canadianheritage.gc.ca under </p><p>"what\'s new."  Following are key features. </p><p> </p><p>-- The review reinforces a basic tenet of Canadian cultural </p><p>policy:  "Canadian content can be created only by Canadians. </p><p>. . . Foreigners cannot relate an event or tell a story from </p><p>a Canadian point of view . . .  . The mere fact of being </p><p>very largely created by Canadians is what gives an </p><p>audiovisual work its unique Canadian identity."  (This </p><p>effectively dismisses the criticism cited in para. 4 above). </p><p>-- The review recommends replacing the various current </p><p>systems for assessing Canadian content, including the </p><p>current points/expenditure system described in para. 3, with </p><p>a single "creative expenditure model" which would be applied </p><p>nationwide.  This would focus on all the "creative costs" of </p><p>a production, classed into four groups:  authors, creative </p><p>collaborators, performers, and technicians.  To qualify as </p><p>Canadian, a production would need to meet minimum </p><p>expenditure requirements in each group.  These minimum </p><p>expenditure requirements would be subject to a system of </p><p>options.  Producers could exercise an option to use non- </p><p>Canadian elements, and pay for this flexibility by incurring </p><p>higher minimum expenditure requirements.  For details, see </p><p>section 3.2 of the report at website canadianheritage.ca </p><p>under "what\'s new". </p><p>-- It recommends that the distribution of Canadian feature </p><p>films in Canada continue to be reserved for Canadian-owned </p><p>and -controlled companies (a long-standing protective </p><p>measure). </p><p> </p><p>-- It recommends that the broadcast regulator consider </p><p>exempting commercials that promote Canadian feature films </p><p>from the twelve-minute-per-hour TV advertising limit.  This </p><p>could reduce the perceived disadvantage faced by Canadian </p><p>films in advertising and promotion vis--vis bigger-budget </p><p>U.S. productions. </p><p> </p><p>7.   COMMENT:  Canada\'s cultural-policy-making establishment </p><p>is making few concessions in the face of the profound </p><p>economic, demographic and technological changes which have </p><p>transformed North America\'s media landscape in recent </p><p>decades.  At least under the leadership of outgoing Prime </p><p>Minister Jean Chretien, all indications are that any policy </p><p>changes will be designed to reinforce and improve the </p><p>existing complex of protections and incentives, rather than </p><p>re-evaluate its relevance.  However, it is clear that the </p><p>challenges to the status quo - both technical (the Internet, </p><p>satellite signal theft, etc.) and political (Chretien is </p><p>scheduled to retire sometime in the coming eight months) - </p><p>will not go away. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
