(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>Reasons 1.5(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: On 11 June, the </p><p>Ambassador congratulated MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid </p><p>Al-Nahyan on the UAE\'s Tier 1 ranking in the 2003 TIP </p><p>Report, noting that the UAE is the only country to </p><p>jump two tiers in this year\'s Report.  An extremely </p><p>grateful Hamdan characterized the news as a welcome </p><p>responsibility and reiterated his commitment to </p><p>continue pushing forward on this issue.  We are using </p><p>the Tier 1 "good news" to reemphasize the importance </p><p>of this issue and encourage continued and increased </p><p>UAEG action -- starting with the Ambassador\'s </p><p>presentation to Hamdan of a "Next Steps Strategy." </p><p>The Department\'s recognition of the UAEG\'s efforts in </p><p>this area has motivated the UAEG to do even more and </p><p>will make our job easier in this regard.  We </p><p>appreciate G/TIP\'s past assistance and look forward to </p><p>continuing to work together as we move forward with </p><p>the UAEG on TIP over the coming year.  END SUMMARY AND </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>Tier 1 -- A Welcome Responsibility </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The Ambassador began a June 11 meeting with </p><p>MFA Minstate Hamdan Bin Zayid (other topics covered </p><p>septel) by congratulating MFA Minstate and </p><p>Presidential son Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan on </p><p>the UAE\'s Tier 1 ranking in the 2003 Trafficking in </p><p>Persons Report.  She commended his personal commitment </p><p>and that of the UAEG as a whole to ending this </p><p>deplorable trade.  Noting that the UAE was the only </p><p>country to jump from Tier 3 to Tier 1 in this year\'s </p><p>Report, the Ambassador informed Hamdan that Secretary </p><p>Powell would be highlighting the UAE\'s efforts, among </p><p>others, when he formally unveiled the report later </p><p>that day in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Ambassador remarked that the UAE\'s Tier 1 </p><p>ranking will likely increase focus on the UAE\'s </p><p>efforts to fight trafficking in persons and advised </p><p>that we should redouble our efforts to ensure that the </p><p>UAE maintains its Tier 1 status in the 2004 Report. </p><p>In that spirit, she presented Hamdan with an embargoed </p><p>copy of the Report and an Embassy-crafted "Next Steps </p><p>Strategy," which lays out recommended UAEG actions in </p><p>the areas of prevention, prosecution and victim </p><p>protection.  The Ambassador hoped that Hamdan would </p><p>give careful consideration to the Next Steps Strategy </p><p>and looked forward to working together over the next </p><p>year.  She advised him that she would be presenting </p><p>the Report to the Crown Prince of Dubai and to the </p><p>Dubai Deputy Ruler, Hamdan bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, as </p><p>well as the Ministers of Information, Justice and </p><p>Interior. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Hamdan thanked the Ambassador and the U.S. </p><p>Mission for its assistance in making the Tier One jump </p><p>possible.  In line with the adage that it\'s easier to </p><p>get to the top than stay there, he agreed that the </p><p>UAEG would need to work even harder now to maintain </p><p>its good record, noting that this achievement was "a </p><p>big responsibility."  He looked forward to working </p><p>together and welcomed the mission\'s input of </p><p>recommended next steps. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Later that day, Hamdan\'s Office Director, </p><p>Sultan Al-Romaithi, advised Poloff that Hamdan is </p><p>determined to increase UAEG efforts to monitor and </p><p>combat TIP.  He stated that this week Hamdan will send </p><p>letters to the other six emirates\' rulers, formally </p><p>notifying them of the UAE\'s Tier 1 placement and the </p><p>necessity to continue UAEG efforts against TIP. </p><p> </p><p>Mission\'s Engagement Plan for 2003-2004 </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) UAEG reaction to our ongoing engagement on TIP </p><p>has been very positive, as evidenced by Hamdan\'s </p><p>personal commitment to this issue and its placement on </p><p>the U.S.-UAE Strategic Dialogue agenda in November </p><p>2002.  The news of the UAE\'s Tier 1 ranking gives us </p><p>an excellent opportunity to redouble our efforts with </p><p>various ministries and emirates to ensure that we </p><p>continue to move forward in combating this </p><p>transnational crime. </p><p>8.  (U) In rolling out the 2003 Report, we are </p><p>emphasizing the importance of this issue in our </p><p>bilateral relationship by forwarding copies of the </p><p>Report and Next Steps Strategy under cover of letter </p><p>signed by the Ambassador to the Ministers of </p><p>Information, Interior, Justice, Labor and Health.  We </p><p>are also forwarding similar packages to the Dubai </p><p>Crown Prince, Dubai Deputy Ruler, Dubai Police </p><p>Commander, Dubai Prosecutor General, Abu Dhabi General </p><p>Health Authority Chairman, and the Interior Ministry </p><p>Undersecretary (who also serves as Head of the Abu </p><p>Dhabi Police Directorate).  We will follow-up the </p><p>delivery of the Report and Next Steps Strategy with </p><p>working-level meetings to maintain the momentum </p><p>created by the release of the 2003 Report and </p><p>encourage the UAEG to sustain and, where possible, </p><p>increase its efforts on TIP. </p><p> </p><p>Next Steps Strategy for the UAEG </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) In the Next Steps Strategy, we included an </p><p>exhaustive list of recommended UAEG actions in the </p><p>areas of prevention, prosecution and victim protection </p><p>that will follow-up and build on the UAEG\'s already </p><p>existing accomplishments: </p><p> </p><p>Prevention </p><p> </p><p>--Sign and enforce legislation codifying the child </p><p>camel jockey ban.
