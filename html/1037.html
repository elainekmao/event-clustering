<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 RIYADH 004064 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/PD, NEA/ARP, AND NEA/P; EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES </p><p>FOR PA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, SOCI, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  A SAUDI RAMADAN FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM </p><p> </p><p>REFERENCE: (A) 98 RIYADH 04122; (B) JEDDAH 01368 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY.  RAMADAN IN SAUDI ARABIA THIS YEAR HAS TAKEN ON </p><p>A CHARACTER QUITE DIFFERENT FROM RAMADANS PAST.  SAUDI </p><p>RAMADAN IS TRADITIONALLY CHARACTERIZED BY DAYTIME INACTIVITY </p><p>AND NIGHTTIME ENERGY, WITH SAUDIS PASSING SOMNAMBULANT DAYS </p><p>AT WORK FOLLOWING NIGHT-LONG FLINGS OF EATING, SHOPPING AND </p><p>VISITING RELATIVES.  DAILY WORKING HOURS IN GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICES ARE OFFICIALLY REDUCED TO FROM 8 HOURS TO 5; AND, </p><p>WHILE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO WORK, IT </p><p>HAS BEEN LARGELY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY ARE EXCUSED FROM </p><p>ACTUALLY WORKING.  EACH YEAR, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES </p><p>THE REDUCTION IN WORKING HOURS FOR RAMADAN, IT IS CUSTOMARY </p><p>FOR IT TO LIKEWISE ANNOUNCE THE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS BY THE END </p><p>OF THE FIRST WEEK OF THE MONTH.  THIS YEAR, HOWEVER, IN WHAT </p><p>APPEARS TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO GRADUALLY CHANGE SAUDIS\' </p><p>BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO RAMADAN, UNIVERSITIES REMAINED OPEN </p><p>THROUGH THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THE MONTH (AND HELD EXAMS), </p><p>AND THE GOVERNMENT ORDERED SCHOOLS TO REMAIN OPEN THROUGH THE </p><p>FIRST THREE WEEKS OF RAMADAN (AND DIRECTED THAT MID-YEAR </p><p>EXAMS BE ADMINISTERED DURING THIS PERIOD).  THIS CHANGE HAS </p><p>BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF PUBLIC ACTIVITY BY </p><p>GOVERNMENT LEADERS AND OFFICIALS, SENDING A SIGNAL THAT THE </p><p>KINGDOM REMAINS "OPEN FOR BUSINESS," DESPITE ITS BEING </p><p>RAMADAN.  THIS HAS HAD A MARKED EFFECT ON THE BEHAVIOR, AND </p><p>MOOD, OF SAUDIS.  JUST ONE YEAR AFTER CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT "THE BOOM TIMES ARE OVER" (REFTEL (A)), THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP APPEARS TO BE USING RAMADAN TO REINFORCE ITS "WAKE </p><p>UP CALL" TO THE SAUDI POPULACE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>TESTED TEMPERS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE OBSERVATION REPORTED BY AMCONGEN JEDDAH (REFTEL (B), </p><p>PARA. 8) -- THAT THE CONTINUATION OF SCHOOLING, AND THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF MID-TERM EXAMS, THROUGH THE THIRD WEEK OF </p><p>RAMADAN HAS FRAYED TEMPERS AND DISRUPTED TRADITIONAL RAMADAN </p><p>FAMILY LIFE -- HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF CONSIDERABLE COMMENT IN </p><p>THE SAUDI MEDIA.  THIS UNPRECEDENTED PHENOMENON HAS MEANT </p><p>THAT THE CUSTOMARY HIGH-LEVEL OF NIGHTTIME ACTIVITY DURING </p><p>THE MONTH HAS BEEN LARGELY REDUCED, AND REPLACED BY MORE </p><p>NORMAL DAYTIME ACTIVITY.  EVEN CASUAL OBSERVATIONS AROUND </p><p>RIYADH REVEAL THAT THE USUAL DENSE NIGHTTIME TRAFFIC HAS </p><p>TAPERED OFF, FAR FEWER RECKLESS STUDENTS ARE CRUISING THE </p><p>STREETS AIMLESSLY, AND EVEN THE LEVEL OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS </p><p>SEEMS TO HAVE DROPPED.  BECAUSE OF EXAMS, FAMILIES ARE </p><p>COMPELLED TO STAY HOME, AND HAVE MUCH LESS TIME FOR SHOPPING, </p><p>TO THE POINT -- APPARENTLY -- OF IMPACTING THE SAUDI RAMADAN </p><p>TRADITION OF REPLACING THE FURNITURE IN THEIR HOUSES:  THE </p><p>USUAL RIYADH STREET SCENE OF TRUCKS FULL OF CARPETS AND </p><p>FURNITURE HAS BEEN LARGELY UNOBSERVED THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>A CONSPICUOUS LACK OF CONSUMPTION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE IMPACT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION FOR SCHOOLS TO </p><p>REMAIN OPEN HAS DRAWN MEDIA ATTENTION TO THE CHANGED CONSUMER </p><p>BEHAVIOR THAT HAS RESULTED.  "AL-HAYAT," FOR EXAMPLE, ON </p><p>DECEMBER 25 PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE UNDER THE HEADLINE "RETREAT </p><p>OF RETAIL SALES IN THE KINGDOM FOR THE FIRST HALF OF </p><p>RAMADAN."  THE ARTICLE NOTES THAT, DESPITE AGGRESSIVE </p><p>PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS -- INCLUDING DISCOUNTING BY MORE THAN </p><p>40 PERCENT, ALONG WITH FREE GIFTS AND OTHER INCENTIVES -- </p><p>CONSUMER SPENDING IS FAR BELOW TRADITIONAL RAMADAN LEVELS; </p><p>THE ARTICLE TIES THIS DECLINE TO THE FACT THAT MID-YEAR EXAMS </p><p>ARE BEING HELD DURING RAMADAN.  THE "AL-HAYAT" ARTICLE ALSO </p><p>NOTES THAT SAUDI MERCHANTS HAD BEEN EXPECTING THE NORMAL 250- </p><p>TO 300-PERCENT INCREASE IN RETAIL SALES DURING RAMADAN, BUT </p><p>THAT CURRENT ESTIMATIONS ARE FOR AN INCREASE OF NO MORE THAN </p><p>40- TO 60-PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN ALL RESPECTS THE CHANGES WHICH HAVE BEEN INDUCED IN </p><p>SAUDI BEHAVIOR THROUGH THE RAMADAN SCHOOL CALENDAR HAVE BEEN </p><p>FOR THE BETTER.  THE ABSENCE OF YOUNG SAUDI MALES CRUISING </p><p>THE STREETS AND SHOPPING MALLS AT ALL HOURS, THE REDUCTION IN </p><p>RECKLESS AND WASTEFUL SPENDING TYPICAL OF THE SEASON, AND THE </p><p>RETENTION OF MORE REGULAR WORK HQITS ARE ALL POSITIVE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE KINGDOM:  FOR THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC AND </p><p>FAMILY LIFE, AND -- IN A COUNTRY WHICH ASPIRES TO ACCEDE TO </p><p>THE WTO, AND TO "SAUDI-IZE" ITS ECONOMY -- FOR THE LONG-TERM </p><p>HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE MESSAGE OF "BUSINESS AS USUAL" -- WHILE PERHAPS MOST </p><p>EMPHATICALLY COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE SCHOOL CALENDAR -- HAS </p><p>BEEN CONVEYED THROUGH A VARIETY OF OTHER MEANS AS WELL. </p><p>RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND MEDIA COMMENTATORS HAVE EMPHASIZED IN </p><p>THEIR SERMONS AND COMMENTARIES THAT THE FASTING REQUIRED OF </p><p>MUSLIMS DURING RAMADAN DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY SHOULD SHIRK </p><p>THEIR WORK AND OTHER DUTIES; RATHER, A DEVOUT MUSLIM MUST </p><p>CONTINUE HIS NORMAL COURSE OF LIFE -- AND WORK -- DURING THE </p><p>MONTH OF RAMADAN. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>LEADING BY EXAMPLE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  A COROLLARY TO THE OBSERVATIONS REGARDING BEHAVIORAL </p><p>CHANGE INDUCED BY THE SCHOOL CALENDAR IS THE NOTICEABLE </p><p>INCREASE IN THE LEVEL AND VISIBILITY OF PUBLIC ACTIVITY BY </p><p>SAUDI LEADERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  WHILE, AS IS ITS </p><p>USUAL RAMADAN CUSTOM, THE CABINET HAS MOVED ITS WEEKLY </p><p>SESSIONS DURING RAMADAN TO NIGHTTIME, ALL INDICATIONS ARE </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS EXERTING AN EFFORT TO CONDUCT </p><p>"BUSINESS AS USUAL" DURING THE MONTH.  THE MOST CONSPICUOUS </p><p>EXAMPLE OF ACTIVE AND "HIGH-VISIBILITY" GOVERNMENT DURING </p><p>RAMADAN WAS LAST WEEK\'S ROLLOUT OF THE KINGDOM\'S ANNUAL </p><p>BUDGET, ACCOMPANIED BY CONSIDERABLE MEDIA ACCESS TO </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS.  MEANWHILE, KING FAHD, CROWN PRINCE </p><p>ABDULLAH, DEFENSE MINISTER PRINCE SULTAN, AND RIYADH GOVERNOR </p><p>PRINCE SALMAN HAVE ALL MADE SEVERAL WELL-PUBLICIZED </p><p>APPEARANCES DURING THIS MONTH -- INAUGURATING NEW PROJECTS, </p><p>INSPECTING GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, HOSTING VISITING FOREIGN </p><p>LEADERS, AND ATTENDING PUBLIC EVENTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ON DECEMBER 27 ALONE, THE "HOME" PAGE OF THE "RIYADH </p><p>DAILY" CARRIED COVERAGE OF THE MOROCCAN KING, THE BAHRAINI </p><p>EMIR, AND THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI MEETING WITH SAUDI OFFICIALS </p><p>(ALL IN MECCA TO PERFORM "UMRA," OR THE MINOR PILGRIMAGE). </p><p>THE SAME PAGE REPORTED ON GRAND MUFTI AL-SHEIKH RECEIVING THE </p><p>HEAD OF THE "DA\'WA" (ISLAMIC CALL) CENTER IN LATIN AMERICA, </p><p>THE SAUDI HAJJ COMMITTEE HOLDING A PLANNING MEETING, THE HEAD </p><p>OF THE "SHOURA COUNCIL" RECEIVING A DELEGATION OF GCC </p><p>CULTURAL OFFICIALS, AND THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF THE ARAB </p><p>BUREAU OF EDUCATION FOR THE GULF STATES MEETING IN JEDDAH. </p><p>SUCH A REPORTED LEVEL OF OFFICIAL ACTIVITY IS HIGH EVEN BY </p><p>SAUDI NON-RAMADAN STANDARDS. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>THE BACKLASH </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  WHILE SOME SOCIETAL ELEMENTS HAVE REACTED WITH </p><p>ACCEPTANCE, EVEN APPRECIATION OF THE "NEW" SAUDI APPROACH TO </p><p>RAMADAN, RESISTANCE TO AND DISSATISFACTION WITH THIS CHANGE </p><p>IS EVIDENT IN MANY QUARTERS.  NOT UNEXPECTEDLY, TEACHERS ARE </p><p>AMONG THOSE WHO ARE MOST VOCAL, A FACT REFLECTED IN THE </p><p>ANECDOTE CONVEYED IN PARA. 8 OF REFTEL (B).  "AL-RIYADH" </p><p>CHIMED IN ON THIS ISSUE ON DECEMBER 23 BY PUBLISHING AN </p><p>"INVESTIGATIVE REPORT" ENTITLED "TEACHERS EXPRESS FRUSTRATION </p><p>OVER WORKING DURING RAMADAN, AND SHOW UNEASINESS FOR </p><p>TEACHING."  THE ARTICLE CITES A NUMBER OF TEACHERS </p><p>CRITICIZING THE NEW ARRANGEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>-- A DEPUTY PRINCIPAL AT AN INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL, COMMENTING </p><p>EMOTIONALLY:  "THIS YEAR EXAMS COME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE </p><p>MONTH OF RAMADAN, WHICH IN MY OPINION PREVENTS TEACHERS AND </p><p>STUDENTS FROM OBSERVING THEIR RELIGIOUS DUTIES DURING THIS </p><p>MONTH IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY. ... (STUDIES) DISTRACT A STUDENT </p><p>FROM PERFORMING HIS RELIGIOUS DUTIES, FROM RECITATION OF THE </p><p>QUR\'AN, AND FROM CHARITABLE WORK DIRECTED TO THE ALMIGHTY </p><p>DURING THIS HOLY MONTH, WHEN WE ARE REQUIRED TO DOUBLE OUR </p><p>WORSHIP OF GOD. ... (AND) THE SAME APPLIES TO THE TEACHER. </p><p>... YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW A TEACHER CAN ... PERFORM HIS </p><p>RELIGIOUS DUTIES DURING THIS HOLY MONTH"; </p><p> </p><p>-- A SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHER EXPRESSING SIMILAR VIEWS, AND </p><p>ARGUING FOR "OBSERVING THE DUTIES OF THIS MONTH WITHOUT ANY </p><p>ANNOYING OBLIGATIONS"; </p><p> </p><p>-- AN INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL TEACHER STATING:  "MOST OF THE </p><p>TEACHERS ARE FRUSTRATED BY CONDUCTING EXAMS DURING THE MONTH </p><p>OF RAMADAN," ADDING "ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS </p><p>TEACHERS FACE DURING THIS MONTH IS LACK OF CONCENTRATION </p><p>AMONG STUDENTS.  THEY ARE STILL YOUNG AND FASTING AFFECTS </p><p>THEM GREATLY..." </p><p> </p><p>-- AND, FINALLY, A TEACHER WHO SUGGESTS THAT "90 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE TEACHERS DO NOT TEACH PROPERLY DURING RAMADAN.  IT IS </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE FOR A TEACHER TO TEACH AN ENTIRE DAY WHILE HE IS </p><p>FASTING."  THIS TEACHER CONCLUDES HIS COMMENTS BY EXPRESSING </p><p>HIS "HOPE FOR A RECONSIDERATION OF THIS ISSUE IN THE FUTURE," </p><p>AND A RETURN TO THE STATUS QUO ANTE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>YOU TOOK THE WORDS ... </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  SIMILAR SENTIMENTS ARE EXPRESSED IN AN ITEM IN THE </p><p>DECEMBER 27 "ARAB NEWS," UNDER THE HEADLINE "PARENTS HAVE </p><p>HARD TIME COPING WITH EXAMS DURING RAMADAN."  THE ARTICLE </p><p>OPENS WITH THE OBSERVATION:  "WITH SCHOOL EXAMS STRETCHING </p><p>WELL INTO THE HOLY MONTH THIS YEAR, IT SEEMS THAT FOR MANY </p><p>PEOPLE RAMADAN LACKS ITS USUAL SPIRITUAL ATMOSPHERE. </p><p>CHILDREN ARE BUSY STUDYING, THEIR PARENTS ARE HELPING THEM </p><p>DAY AND NIGHT, AND TEACHERS ARE CORRECTING PAPERS.  MANY </p><p>READILY ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE NOT YET FELT THE SPIRITUAL </p><p>CALMNESS THEY NORMALLY FEEL DURING THIS MONTH." </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO GIVE VENT TO THE COMPLAINTS AND </p><p>FRUSTRATIONS OF SEVERAL STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS, BEFORE </p><p>CONCLUDING WITH THE COMMENT:  "UNTIL EXAMS FINISH AT THE END </p><p>OF THIS WEEK THE PEOPLE OF THE KINGDOM MUST ACCUSTOM </p><p>THEMSELVES TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND CONCENTRATE ON MAKING </p><p>THE LAST TEN DAYS OF THE MONTH A PURELY SPIRITUAL EXERCISE." </p><p>THE CROWN PRINCE HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT ANY BETTER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOWLER </p><p></p></div>
