<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001467 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR IRAQ PD TASK FORCE, NEA/ARP </p><p>AND NEA/P </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: PUBLIC OPINION WRAP-UP: </p><p>  RESIGNATION TURNING TO ANGER </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY AND COMMENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Six days into Operation Iraqi </p><p>Freedom, even our closest and most </p><p>westernized Emirati contacts are disturbed </p><p>by the coverage they are seeing of the Iraq </p><p>war.  The emotional impact of the images of </p><p>civilian casualties and the negative spin </p><p>being imparted by the vast bulk of the Arab </p><p>media are having a real effect.  As one pro- </p><p>western, Boston University-educated Emirati </p><p>technocrat put it:  "We are reacting </p><p>emotionally as Arabs to the death of Arab </p><p>civilians and the humiliation of a once- </p><p>proud Arab state." </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Emiratis would like the war to end as </p><p>soon as possible and with a minimum loss of </p><p>life.  Several close contacts have urged us </p><p>to keep Iraqi TV off the air.  Our contacts </p><p>don\'t understand why the U.S. has allowed </p><p>the Iraqi regime to get its message out in </p><p>what has been a devastatingly effective </p><p>propaganda campaign.  While there is little </p><p>doubt here that the coalition will </p><p>ultimately prevail, there is a growing sense </p><p>that we are losing the information war. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) While we may not be able to turn </p><p>the tide on the strong anti-American </p><p>sentiment -- which predated this conflict -- </p><p>we are taking steps to get our story on the </p><p>air and in the papers.  Our Public Affairs </p><p>Office, like other in the region, is in </p><p>daily contact with the Iraq PD Task Force </p><p>and CENTCOM with recommendations on how we </p><p>can better shape our message.  We are also </p><p>disseminating information, via IIP products, </p><p>to the media and the public on coalition </p><p>efforts.  To help counter the slew of </p><p>misinformation, we intend to deploy our </p><p>Arabic-speaking officers to engage </p><p>informally with local journalists.  At the </p><p>appropriate time, the Ambassador, a fluent </p><p>Arabic speaker, will meet with select </p><p>members of the press to get the humanitarian </p><p>story out.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>SLEEPLESS IN ABU DHABI: </p><p>WAR WATCHING TILL DAWN </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) In the UAE, as elsewhere in the Arab </p><p>world, people are closely monitoring the </p><p>course of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  In a </p><p>country where even newspaper deliverymen </p><p>carry cell phones, many receive regular news </p><p>updates on their mobiles while others </p><p>exchange text messages with the latest dark- </p><p>humor jokes on the conflict.  Families </p><p>gather late into the night in front of the </p><p>television set surfing the major Arabic news </p><p>satellite channels, namely, Al-Jazeera, Abu </p><p>Dhabi TV and Al-Arabiya.  As one of our </p><p>contacts put it, "No one is working because </p><p>everyone is up late watching TV." </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Television is clearly having an </p><p>impact on public opinion in the UAE.  Senior </p><p>Emiratis have expressed consternation at the </p><p>disturbing and often gruesome visuals of </p><p>dead, burned and maimed Iraqi civilians </p><p>being aired on Al-Jazeera.  While there is a </p><p>belief that the coalition forces will win </p><p>the conflict on the ground in Iraq, there is </p><p>growing concern that we are losing the </p><p>information war across the entire Arab </p><p>world.  As a well-connected Sharjah notable </p><p>put it to Dubai Consul General on March 25: </p><p>"Get the cameras out [of Iraq]." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AGREEMENT THAT SADDAM MUST GO </p><p>BUT RESIGNATION TURNING TO </p><p>ANGER AS CASUALTIES INCREASE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Among elites, there is a widespread </p><p>recognition that Saddam Hussein must go, and </p><p>in this regard, key opinion makers are still </p><p>with us (in a way that they are most </p><p>definitely not on the Palestinian/Israeli </p><p>conflict).  However, they are nervous </p><p>because they fear that the daily bombardment </p><p>of negative images will make it impossible </p><p>to support a goal they believe in -- getting </p><p>rid of Saddam. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) As the days go by and the number of </p><p>Iraqi civilian casualties increase, our </p><p>contacts\' focus is shifting from the </p><p>suffering of the Iraqi people at the hands </p><p>of Saddam Hussein and 12 years of sanctions </p><p>to the perceived suffering of the Iraqi </p><p>people as a result of coalition bombing. </p><p>There is a general disbelief that bombs </p><p>dropped in Baghdad are hitting only </p><p>strategic targets.  Rather, most comment </p><p>that "what the U.S. is doing is brutal -- </p><p>bombing the people." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The specter of an Arab country under </p><p>attack has brought to the fore an emotional </p><p>identification with fellow Arabs and </p><p>Muslims.  An Emirati banker stated: </p><p>"Baghdad is the historical capital of Arab </p><p>culture and civilization.  It is being </p><p>attacked and occupied.  It is disgraceful </p><p>and shameful, and the images [of the </p><p>civilian casualties in Basra] are </p><p>horrifying."  These sentiments are not </p><p>shared by the large Iraqi expatriate </p><p>community.  An Iraqi physician downplayed </p><p>the anti-American hype in the Arab media as </p><p>a throwback to the cold war when the press </p><p>was state-controlled. </p><p> </p><p>FEAR OF A LONG, DRAWN-OUT CONFLICT </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Our interlocutors\' general </p><p>impression before the war was that the </p><p>operation to remove Saddam Hussein would be </p><p>quick and painless.  Instead, based on what </p><p>they see on television, their general </p><p>impression is that coalition forces are not </p><p>much closer now to removing Saddam Hussein </p><p>than they were on Day 1.  Many are comparing </p><p>this conflict unfavorably to the 1991 Gulf </p><p>War, in which the ground campaign lasted </p><p>only 100 hours. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Prominent interlocutors believe </p><p>that a long, drawn-out conflict will bring </p><p>untold negative consequences to regional </p><p>economic and political stability.  Their </p><p>unified message:  "Hurry up and get it over </p><p>with."  (Comment: In this regard, messages </p><p>from the White House and CENTCOM preparing </p><p>Americans for a long conflict, while </p><p>necessary for managing the expectations of </p><p>the American public, go down very badly here </p><p>for the coalition but in the long term will </p><p>serve to lower expectations. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) This cable was coordinated with </p><p>ConGen Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
