<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001921 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, NI, WCAR </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO IS READY TO WORK WITH U.S. ON </p><p>WCAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 130883 (B) ABUJA 966 (C) ABUJA 1156 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Per Ref A request, Ambassador met with President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo on July 31 to discuss the WCAR.  Other </p><p>issues raised were Nigeria\'s role in Zimbabwe and post-JEPC </p><p>bilateral engagement, both covered in septels.  This cable </p><p>reports on the WCAR discussion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Ambassador Jeter expressed the USG desire to work with </p><p>Nigeria and emphasized the importance of using Geneva for a </p><p>constructive dialogue on WCAR.  The Ambassador stressed that </p><p>together we can use this opportunity to lead the </p><p>international community to confront the scourge of racism. </p><p>However, he explained, the USG could not participate in WCAR </p><p>unless there is agreement to remove unacceptable language </p><p>involving reparations for the slave trade and comparisons </p><p>between Zionism and racism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) President Obasanjo agreed that all forms of </p><p>discrimination must be condemned and that Zionism cannot be </p><p>equated with racism.  The President emphatically asserted </p><p>that he would oppose the demand for reparations at the Geneva </p><p>meeting, calling the concept "complete nonsense."  He then </p><p>described the possible involvement of his own great, great </p><p>grandfather in assisting slave traders.  Pointing to </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, an African American, he asked rhetorically, </p><p>&who should be compensated, my great, great grandfather who </p><p>helped to perpetuate the slave trade, or your great, great, </p><p>grandfather who was a victim of it.8  Obasanjo argued that </p><p>reparations to African countries whose forefathers helped to </p><p>perpetrate these acts is simply "not right".  He rhetorically </p><p>asked how we could expect reparations when even today the </p><p>slave trade continues in Africa.  &Don,t worry. That will </p><p>not happen,8 he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador Jeter noted that the President\'s position </p><p>was radically different from that of his representatives in </p><p>Geneva and in the Foreign Ministry.  The President replied </p><p>that the Nigerian Permanent Representatives in New York and </p><p>Geneva "did not know my mind before, but now they do."  He </p><p>went on to explain that he had briefed Ambassador Mbanefo at </p><p>the UN Mission in New York on Nigeria,s position.  Asking </p><p>his Ambassador in Geneva to stand-down, the President had </p><p>ordered Mbanefo to attend the Geneva meeting to present GON </p><p>views. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment.  President Obasanjo\'s position came as a </p><p>complete surprise.  Embassy demarches on this issue thus far </p><p>have been politely but firmly rebuffed, particularly at the </p><p>Second United Nations Unit of the MFA (see Refs B and C). </p><p>While inclusion of language concerning Zionism and racism </p><p>usually appears less important to Foreign Ministry personnel, </p><p>they uniformly assert the need for WCAR discussion of </p><p>reparations and apologies for colonial-era transatlantic </p><p>slave trading.  They become visibly uncomfortable when asked </p><p>about ongoing trafficking in persons.  The most senior </p><p>official demarched prior to the President offered only that </p><p>Nigeria could be flexible on the form (increased aid, debt </p><p>forgiveness, etc.) that "reparations" might take.  Our next </p><p>interaction with our WCAR interlocutors at MFA should be </p><p>enlightening. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment continued: Obasanjo\'s new position on the WCAR </p><p>is just one more example of foreign policy making at the </p><p>highest levels of the GON.  This is not the first time </p><p>Obasanjo has turned a policy on its head, leaving us to </p><p>wonder whether Obasanjo\'s views have filtered through the </p><p>bureaucracy.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
