REASONS:  1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ACCORDING TO A SENIOR MDC ADVISOR, THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY HAS RECEIVED ADDITIONAL FEELERS FROM ZANU-PF ABOUT </p><p>MAKING A DEAL THAT INVOLVES PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S DEPARTURE </p><p>FROM OFFICE.  MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS REPORTEDLY </p><p>WILLING TO AGREE TO A GRACEFUL EXIT FOR MUGABE BECAUSE IT </p><p>IS IN ZIMBABWE\'S NATIONAL INTEREST.  THE MDC ADVISOR SAID </p><p>KOFI ANNAN RECENTLY OFFERED MUGABE A PACKAGE TO STEP DOWN, </p><p>WHICH HE DECLINED, AND THAT A SHADY ZIMBABWEAN BUSINESSMAN </p><p>HAS TOLD ZANU-PF HE IS WILLING TO FINANCE A "RETIREMENT </p><p>PACKAGE" FOR THE PRESIDENT.  MEANWHILE, GREG BRACKENRIDGE, </p><p>A BANKER NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY POLITICAL PARTY, HAS BEEN </p><p>ASKED BY THE MDC TO ORGANIZE A PRIVATE SECTOR INITIATIVE </p><p>FOCUSED ON FORGING AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN ZANU-PF AND THE MDC </p><p>ON A WAY OUT OF ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT MESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF SEES WRITING ON WALL, WANTS A DEAL </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN A SEPTEMBER 26 CALL ON DCM AND POLOFF, SENIOR </p><p>MDC ADVISOR CLIVE PUZEY SAID THE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF </p><p>SENIOR ZANU-PF MEMBERS ARE BEING BADLY DAMAGED BY THE </p><p>CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION.  THEY BLAME </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE AND ARE DETERMINED TO FIND A WAY TO EASE </p><p>HIM OUT IN A DIGNIFIED WAY.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEY REALIZE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05461  01 OF 02  271458Z </p><p>THAT THE MDC IS GAINING STRENGTH IN THE RURAL AREAS -- TWO </p><p>RECENT RALLIES BY MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI ATTRACTED </p><p>THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND RAISED FUNDS FOR THE PARTY -- AND </p><p>SEE THEIR LOSS OF POWER AS INEVITABLE.  THEY HAVE BEGUN TO </p><p>TALK SERIOUSLY TO THE MDC ABOUT MAKING A DEAL.  ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>IS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT, MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI HAS AGREED THAT IT IS IN ZIMBABWE\'S BEST </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>INTERESTS FOR THE MDC TO DO ALL IT CAN TO SECURE A GRACEFUL </p><p>EXIT STRATEGY THAT PRESERVES SOMEWHAT OF A POSITIVE LEGACY </p><p>FOR MUGABE.  OTHERWISE, THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE LITTLE </p><p>INCENTIVE TO GO. </p><p> </p><p>ENCOURAGING MUGABE TO STEP DOWN </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE BOARD OF LEVER BROTHERS INFORMED THE MDC, PUZEY </p><p>REPORTED, THAT KOFI ANNAN, IN THE RECENT MEETING IN NEW </p><p>YORK DURING THE MILLENIUM SUMMIT, OFFERED MUGABE A DEAL TO </p><p>STEP DOWN.  ALTHOUGH PUZEY SAID THE MDC WAS NOT PRIVY TO </p><p>THE DETAILS, HE SURMISED THAT ANNAN\'S SUPPOSED DEAL </p><p>PROBABLY INCLUDED PROVISION OF SAFEHAVEN AND A FINANCIAL </p><p>PACKAGE FROM LIBYAN PRESIDENT QADHAFI.  THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY HEARD THAT MUGABE TURNED DOWN THE OFFER THE FOLLOWING </p><p>DAY, AFTER DISCUSSING IT WITH THE FIRST LADY.  ANNAN, PUZEY </p><p>CONTINUED, IS NOT THE ONLY ONE TRYING TO FACILITATE </p><p>MUGABE\'S DEPARTURE.  ONE BEN COOK, A REPORTED ZANU-PF </p><p>SOURCE IN A POSITION TO KNOW, INFORMED PUZEY THAT JOHN </p><p>BREDENCAMP, A SHADY WHITE ZIMBABWEAN BUSINESSMAN, HAD TOLD </p><p>ZANU-PF HE WOULD PROVIDE A FINANCIAL "RETIREMENT" PACKAGE </p><p>FOR MUGABE.  PUZEY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER BREDENCAMP HAD </p><p>SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO MAKE SUCH A PACKAGE ATTRACTIVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05461  01 OF 02  271458Z </p><p>ENOUGH, BUT HE CLAIMED THAT BREDENCAMP WORKED FOR MI6 AND </p><p>COULD BE A CHANNEL FOR THE BRITISH TO PROVIDE FUNDS TO </p><p>SWEETEN THE DEAL. (COMMENT: THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSION </p><p>HERE SCOFFED AT THE VERY IDEA.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE MDC, ACCORDING TO PUZEY, BELIEVED THAT THE </p><p>BEST WAY TO PROCEED WAS FOR AN INDEPENDENT BODY -- </p><p>PREFERABLY MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY NOT AFFILIATED </p><p>WITH A PARTICULAR POLITICAL PARTY --  TO WORK WITH ZANU-PF </p><p>AND THE MDC TO FORGE A MUTUALLY AGREEABLE WAY OUT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT MESS.  THE MDC HAS APPROACHED GREG </p><p>BRACKENRIDGE, MANAGING MANAGER OF STANBIC BANK, ABOUT </p><p>LEADING SUCH AN EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR AS MIDDLEMAN </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SHORTLY AFTER OUR DISCUSSION WITH PUZEY, GREG </p><p>BRACKENRIDGE CALLED ON THE DCM AND POLOFF.  BRACKENRIDGE </p><p>NOTED THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY WAS HEADED FOR DISASTER, </p><p>AND HE WAS EXPLORING HOW KEY MEMBERS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>HERE COULD PREVENT A POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TRAINWRECK.  HE </p><p>INSISTED THAT HE HAD NO POLITICAL AFFILIATION, AND </p><p>THEREFORE HAS A CERTAIN CREDIBILITY WITH BOTH MAJOR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2532 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05461  02 OF 02  271459Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------8A8E22  271459Z /38 </p><p>O 271459Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7213 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 005461 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/21/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZANU-PF REPORTEDLY INTERESTED IN DEAL WITH MDC </p><p>THAT INVOLVES MUGABE\'S DEPARTURE </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES.  THE CHALLENGE, BRACKENRIDGE SAID, IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05461  02 OF 02  271459Z </p><p>CONVINCING ZANU-PF AND THE MDC, WHO MISTRUST EACH OTHER </p><p>IMMENSELY, TO SIT IN A ROOM TOGETHER AND AGREE ON A WAY </p><p>FORWARD. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  BRACKENRIDGE SAID HE HAS HEARD HINTS THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE IS WILLING TO STEP DOWN UNDER THE RIGHT </p><p>CONDITIONS.  THAT WOULD BE REMARKABLE, THE DCM POINTED OUT, </p><p>AS A DECISION NOT TO STAND FOR PRESIDENT IN 2002 WOULD MAKE </p><p>MUGABE A LAME DUCK AND LIKELY WOULD FURTHER UNDERMINE HIS </p><p>ABILITY TO GOVERN EFFECTIVELY.   THAT SCENARIO, </p><p>BRACKENRIDGE REPLIED, ASSUMES THAT MUGABE WOULD SERVE OUT </p><p>THE REMAINDER OF HIS TERM.  THE PRESIDENT, HE HAS BEEN </p><p>TOLD, WOULD BE WILLING TO STAND DOWN NOW IF HE IS CONVINCED </p><p>THAT HIS LAND REDISTRIBUTION PLAN IS ON TRACK.  AMNESTY </p><p>WOULD LIKELY BE ANOTHER CONDITION, BRACKENRIDGE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THERE IS A GROWING REALIZATION IN ZANU-PF, </p><p>BRACKENRIDGE INSISTED, THAT THE CONTINUED DETERIORATION OF </p><p>THE ECONOMY WILL INEVITABLY HAND THE COUNTRY ON A SILVER </p><p>PLATTER TO THE MDC.  IN ORDER TO GAIN POWER, THE MDC MERELY </p><p>HAS TO WAIT.  ZANU-PF, THEREFORE, IS PRIMED TO MAKE A DEAL. </p><p>ASKED WHAT THE CATALYST WAS FOR SUCH A DEAL, BRACKENRIDGE </p><p>SAID ONE POSSIBILITY IS A CONFERENCE, ORGANIZED BY KEY </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR, IN WHICH AN INTERNATIONALLY </p><p>RESPECTED FIGURE SEEN AS IMPARTIAL BY BOTH SIDES WOULD </p><p>ATTEMPT TO FORGE AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN ZANU-PF AND THE MDC, </p><p>PRIMARILY ON LAND BUT ALSO ON OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES.  SUCH </p><p>A CONFERENCE WOULD ALSO ADDRESS HOW COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHILE </p><p>AND ARGENTINA MADE THE TRANSITION TO MULTI-PARTY DEMOCRACY </p><p>AND DEALT WITH THE QUESTION OF AMNESTY.  ASKED HOW THE </p><p>UNITED STATES COULD HELP, BRACKENRIDGE REPLIED THAT AN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05461  02 OF 02  271459Z </p><p>HONEST BROKER WAS NEEDED TO CONVINCE ZANU-PF TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>AND TO UNDERWRITE THE COSTS OF WHATEVER AGREEMENT EMERGED. </p><p>THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, HE CLAIMED, HAS 36 MILLION POUNDS </p><p>AVAILABLE FOR LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE, BUT THEY ARE </p><p>PROBABLY TOO ANTAGONISTIC TO PLAY AN HONEST BROKER ROLE. </p><p>THE AMERICANS, THOUGH, PROBABLY WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WOULDN\'T PRESIDENT MUGABE HAVE TO BE IN THE LOOP ON </p><p>SUCH AN INITIATIVE, THE DCM ASKED?  ABSOLUTELY, </p><p>BRACKENRIDGE REPLIED.  THEIR EFFORT WOULD BE DESCRIBED TO </p><p>THE PRESIDENT AS A NON-PARTISAN PRIVATE SECTOR INITIATIVE </p><p>INTENDED TO REACH AGREEMENT ON A LAND REFORM PROGRAM </p><p>ACCEPTABLE TO ALL THE MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS, THEREBY RESTORING </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S CREDIBILITY IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A CARROT FOR MUGABE </p><p>TO ENDORSE OR PARTICIPATE IN SUCH AN EFFORT.  ASKED WHETHER </p><p>HE MEANT A FINANCIAL PAYOFF, BRACKENRIDGE DEMURRED, ONLY </p><p>INTIMATING THAT THAT ISSUE WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  MANY MEMBERS OF ZANU-PF ARE INCREASINGLY CONVINCED </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE IS A SERIOUS LIABILITY.  A MEMBER OF </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S POLITBURO RECENTLY TOLD THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>"FINANCIAL GAZETTE" THAT THE PARTY HAD AGREED THAT MUGABE </p><p>SHOULD NOT RUN FOR REELECTION, BUT IT HAD NOT YET SETTLED </p><p>ON A CONSENSUS CANDIDATE.  AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO </p><p>DETERIORATE, ZANU-PF OFFICIALS REALIZE THAT MUGABE\'S </p><p>CONTINUATION IN POWER WILL LEAD INEVITABLY TO THE ELECTION </p><p>OF AN MDC PRESIDENT IN 2002.   IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05461  02 OF 02  271459Z </p><p>THEY ARE UNDERSTANDABLY SEARCHING FOR A WAY TO PROTECT </p><p>THEMSELVES FROM PROSECUTION AND THEIR ECONOMIC ASSETS FROM </p><p>SEIZURE OR CONTINUED DETERIORATION.  WE ARE NOT SURPRISED, </p><p>THEREFORE, BY THE RULING PARTY\'S BACK-CHANNEL APPROACHES TO </p><p>THE MDC ABOUT REACHING A DEAL, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE </p><p>PROBABLY GENUINE.  THE CRITICAL QUESTION IS HOW MUGABE WILL </p><p>REACT IF HE CATCHES WIND OF IT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) WE ARE INTRIGUED BY BRACKENRIDGE\'S EFFORT.  HIS </p><p>THINKING ABOUT HOW TO BROKER SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT IS </p><p>CLEARLY IN THE INCIPIENT STAGES AND, TO BE SUCCESSFUL, HE </p><p>MUST FIRST OVERCOME SERIOUS MISTRUST ON BOTH SIDES. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE CONFERENCE HE ENVISIONS WOULD, ON THE SURFACE, </p><p>FOCUS ON REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON LAND, ITS REAL OBJECTIVE </p><p>WOULD BE TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS OF MUGABE\'S DEPARTURE FROM </p><p>OFFICE.  BRACKENRIDGE CLEARLY HAS MUCH GROUNDWORK TO DO. </p><p>THE CLOCK IS TICKING, AS ZANU-PF MAY DISCUSS THE SUCCESSION </p><p>ISSUE AT ITS EXTRAORDINARY CONGRESS LATER THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
