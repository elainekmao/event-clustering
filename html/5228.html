(C/NF) SUMMARY:  In a January 17 meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador, Japanese Special Envoy Akashi reviewed his </p><p>visit to Sri Lanka, noting that President Kumaratunga </p><p>had decided not to meet him.  He said the donors\' </p><p>conference in Tokyo was set for June 9-10, and he </p><p>invited Deputy Secretary Armitage to attend and for the </p><p>U.S. to serve as co-chair.  Discussing his recent visit </p><p>to India, Akashi said the GoI welcomed Japan\'s </p><p>involvement in the peace process.  In separate </p><p>conversations, however, GSL Minister Moragoda told us </p><p>that he was hearing that the GoI was not fully on board </p><p>with Japan\'s emerging role.  Akashi seems to be hitting </p><p>the right notes, but there appears to be a GoI/GoJ </p><p>disconnect re his involvement.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>Akashi Reviews Visit </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) Ambassador Wills and DCM met January 17 with </p><p>Yasushi Akashi, Japan\'s Special Envoy on Sri Lankan </p><p>issues.  Akashi related that his visit to Sri Lanka was </p><p>proceeding relatively well, so far.  (Note:  Akashi </p><p>visited Sri Lanka from January 15-19.)  He had had good </p><p>meetings with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and </p><p>Opposition leader Mahinda Rajapakse of the People\'s </p><p>Alliance.  He had also attended a meeting of the "Sub- </p><p>Committee for Immediate Humanitarian and Rehabilitation </p><p>Needs" in Kilinochchi in Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE)-controlled northern Sri Lanka.  (Note: </p><p>Akashi is officially the "principal adviser" to this </p><p>joint GSL-LTTE sub-committee.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) Akashi noted that President Kumaratunga, at </p><p>the last moment, had cancelled her meeting with him, </p><p>sending a "cordial" letter explaining that she had been </p><p>engaged in another meeting.  While he was not "upset" </p><p>about it, the fact that the meeting did not take place </p><p>was too bad, Akashi said.  He had hoped to deliver a </p><p>strong message to the president, requesting that she </p><p>work to improve strained "cohabitation" relations with </p><p>the PM.  Foreign Minister Kawaguchi had delivered </p><p>Kumaratunga such a message during her recent visit to </p><p>Sri Lanka (see Reftels), he noted.  Japan believed that </p><p>if there was one issue that could undermine the peace </p><p>process it was political problems in the south.  Akashi </p><p>noted that he planned to meet with a representative of </p><p>the radical, Sinhalese extremist Janantha Vimukthi </p><p>Peramuna (JVP) party and would use that meeting to </p><p>underscore Japanese support for the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C/NF) Ambassador Wills agreed that cohabitation and </p><p>related problems in the south needed to be worked out in </p><p>order for the peace process to continue to move forward. </p><p>The issues involved were not intractable, but it would </p><p>take a lot of concerted international pressure on actors </p><p>in the south to reach the right result. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C/NF) Queried about his recent discussions with </p><p>LTTE senior negotiator Anton Balasingham, Akashi replied </p><p>that the meeting, which was held in Bangkok after the </p><p>recent talks there (see Reftels), had been very </p><p>constructive.  Balasingham had seemed "80 percent" </p><p>sincere in his desire to see a negotiated end to the </p><p>war.  He also seemed agreeable to enhancing the priority </p><p>given to human rights in the peace process, perhaps by </p><p>announcement of a joint GSL-LTTE "charter" on the </p><p>subject during subsequent peace talks with the GSL.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that some of Balasingham\'s comments </p><p>made in the course of the recent GSL-LTTE talks had been </p><p>disturbing, including his reference in a BBC TV </p><p>interview that the LTTE had no intention of disarming </p><p>soon (see Reftels).  Akashi said he had had the same </p><p>impression.  Nonetheless, Akashi allowed, Balasingham </p><p>had indicated some give on the issue of the Sri Lankan </p><p>military\'s "high security zones" in Jaffna during their </p><p>meeting.  (Note:  The LTTE has demanded a sharp </p><p>reduction in the size of these zones.  Also see Para 9 </p><p>below.)  The Ambassador noted that he had met with </p><p>Defense Minister Marapana recently, who had also </p><p>expressed confidence that the security zone issue could </p><p>be dealt with.  In any case, the Ambassador said, the </p><p>presence of the Sri Lankan military in the north and </p><p>east was a vital one in underscoring the unity of the </p><p>country and as a deterrent to the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>======================================= </p><p>Donors\' Conference and U.S. Involvement </p><p>======================================= </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C/NF) Switching gears, Akashi related that the </p><p>international donors\' conference for Sri Lanka was now </p><p>scheduled to take place in Tokyo from June 9-10.  Japan </p><p>very much hoped that Deputy Secretary Armitage would be </p><p>able to attend.  As with the Norwegian government\'s </p><p>efforts during the (November 2002) Oslo conference, the </p><p>GoJ promised that it would choreograph the event to </p><p>limit any possibility that U.S. participants would come </p><p>into contact with the LTTE.  Akashi added that the </p><p>Japanese government would like the U.S. to serve as a </p><p>co-chair of the conference, with the model being the </p><p>Afghanistan reconstruction conference and its four co- </p><p>chairs.  Ambassador Wills replied that he appreciated </p><p>this information and would pass it to Washington right </p><p>away. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) Queried for further details re the </p><p>conference, Akashi responded that the GoJ was still </p><p>developing its proposals and no target levels for </p><p>development assistance from donors had yet been settled </p><p>upon.  The GoJ hoped that the conference would focus on </p><p>the whole of Sri Lanka, and not only on the north and </p><p>east, which seemed to be the World Bank\'s areas of </p><p>focus.  Akashi went on to add that the GoJ was planning </p><p>on hosting the March 18-21 round of GSL-LTTE peace </p><p>talks. </p><p> </p><p>======== </p><p>Re India </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C/NF) On the subject of the donors\' conference, </p><p>Akashi noted that Japan was hoping that India would also </p><p>serve as a co-chair.  He had raised this idea with the </p><p>GoI during his recent visit to India.  His interlocutors </p><p>had been non-committal.  National Security Adviser </p><p>Mishra had noted, for example, that India\'s Sri Lanka </p><p>policy was "complicated" by domestic politics, as well </p><p>as legal restrictions prohibiting any interaction with </p><p>the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C/NF) Re his own role, Akashi remarked that he had </p><p>"clarified" to Indian interlocutors that his focus was </p><p>on development-related issues.  In response, the GoI had </p><p>welcomed his efforts, asserting that Japanese </p><p>involvement could only help the Sri Lankan situation. </p><p>Akashi said he had promised to keep the Indians briefed </p><p>on his efforts.  While in New Delhi, Akashi commented </p><p>that he had also met General (ret\'d) Satish Nambiar, an </p><p>Indian who was working on a report on the security zones </p><p>in Jaffna.  Akashi said he knew Nambiar and trusted him </p><p>to come up with a fair-minded report.  The Ambassador </p><p>remarked that India was a critical regional player and </p><p>could play a very important role in the Sri Lankan peace </p><p>process.  So far, the Indian government seemed a bit </p><p>passive, although some officials such as Mishra </p><p>reportedly wanted the GoI to assume a more activist </p><p>stance. </p><p> </p><p>========================================== </p><p>Moragoda\'s Comments re Akashi, Balasingham </p><p>========================================== </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C/NF) Contradicting Akashi in separate </p><p>conversations with the Ambassador and DCM recently, key </p><p>Sri Lankan Minister Milinda Moragoda told us that he was </p><p>hearing that the GoI was not fully on board with Japan\'s </p><p>expanding role.  Moragoda said to the Ambassador that </p><p>National Security Adviser Mishra had phoned him up after </p><p>Akashi\'s visit to New Delhi and told him that the Indian </p><p>government was not happy that the Japanese were becoming </p><p>so heavily involved.  Amplifying on these remarks in a </p><p>subsequent conversation with the DCM, Moragoda said </p><p>Mishra had told him that India did not want to serve as </p><p>a "co-chair" at the June donors\' conference.  In </p><p>general, the GoI felt that Akashi was too "pushy" and </p><p>that he was too engaged in political aspects of the </p><p>peace process.  Moragoda indicated that he (Moragoda) </p><p>also felt that the Japanese were a bit clumsy.  Citing </p><p>an example of this, he related that he been told that </p><p>Akashi, in a meeting with Norwegian Embassy </p><p>representatives during his visit to Sri Lanka, had </p><p>thanked the GoN for "inviting" Japan to help in the </p><p>peace process.  The Norwegians had told Moragoda they </p><p>were stunned by this comment inasmuch as the GoN had </p><p>never urged Japan to get involved:  it had all been the </p><p>GoJ\'s idea. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C/NF) Regarding other aspects of the peace </p><p>process, Moragoda said he had received news that </p><p>Balasingham was quite ill and might not be able to </p><p>participate in the next round of talks scheduled for </p><p>February 7-10 in Thailand.  Balasingham\'s health </p><p>concerns seemed genuine and not a ruse to get out of the </p><p>talks, Moragoda said.  As he has on previous occasions </p><p>(see Reftels), Moragoda added that he worried that </p><p>Balasingham was so ill that he might be out of the </p><p>picture soon.  If that happened, it was not clear whom </p><p>the LTTE might name to replace him as chief negotiator. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C/NF) Re the February talks, Moragoda said they </p><p>might take place at a lower-level if Balasingham could </p><p>not make it.  Other options included the GSL meeting </p><p>with Balasingham in London, although this might mean </p><p>that other LTTE delegation members might not be able to </p><p>attend.  (Note:  Balasingham lives in London and is a </p><p>British citizen.  Other members of his LTTE peace talks\' </p><p>team, however, travel using Sri Lankan passports and </p><p>would presumably be subject to British rules proscribing </p><p>the LTTE if they tried to travel to London.)  Moragoda </p><p>said Balasingham might try to travel to the LTTE- </p><p>controlled Wanni region at some point in February to </p><p>consult with the LTTE leadership if his health, and </p><p>health conditions there, allow it.  (Note:  The Wanni </p><p>and Jaffna have been afflicted by an increase in </p><p>incidence of dengue and typhoid of late.) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C/NF) Akashi seems very well-informed and to be </p><p>hitting the right notes re the peace process.  Based on </p><p>Moragoda\'s remarks, however, there seems to be a real </p><p>disconnect between the Indians and Japan on his precise </p><p>role, with the GoI feeling that Akashi is straying too </p><p>far from a purely development-related role into </p><p>political aspects of the process.  Indeed, based on his </p><p>conversation with us, Akashi does appear to be touching </p><p>on territory that the Norwegian facilitators have been </p><p>dealing with.  We would hazard to guess that India could </p><p>probably live with the current situation as long as the </p><p>GoJ does not try to push the Norwegians out of the way. </p><p>To his credit, there is no sign that Akashi wants to do </p><p>that.  Re Kumaratunga\'s cancellation of her meeting with </p><p>Akashi, we do not want to jump to conclusions, but it </p><p>could be another sign that the often cantankerous </p><p>president is playing to anti-peace process elements.  In </p><p>what seemed to be a calculated move, she refused to meet </p><p>with Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Helgesen during </p><p>his last visit to Sri Lanka in late 2001, for example, </p><p>and since that time has upped her criticism of the GoN </p><p>role.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
