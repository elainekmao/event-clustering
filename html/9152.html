<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001687 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PINS, SOCI, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR, ETMIN </p><p>SUBJECT:  PROTESTANTS CLAIM MORE HARASSMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  HANOI 0551  B.   Hanoi 0349 </p><p>-     C.  HCMC 941 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary.  Unconfirmed reports continue to indicate </p><p>efforts by local authorities to pressure ethnic minority </p><p>Protestants in some locations to renounce their faith. </p><p>These reports claim at least one recent murder and more </p><p>detentions.  Some ethnic minority Protestants have </p><p>reportedly also had to pay fines for illegal gatherings. </p><p>While the religious life of most believers in Vietnam, </p><p>including Protestants, appears to be unaffected by any new </p><p>efforts, authorities at least in the two sensitive Highland </p><p>areas appear to have focused attention on what appear to </p><p>them purely illegal actions outside the recognized </p><p>Protestant structure.  Interestingly, these efforts to not </p><p>appear to be very successful.   Septel will report on some </p><p>refutations of such claims by Party officials in Hanoi and </p><p>provincial officials in Lai Chau and Son La provinces.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Foreign correspondents recently provided Embassy </p><p>with copies of letters and other accounts from Vietnamese </p><p>Protestants detailing recent cases of harassment, </p><p>detentions, and even murder among some ethnic minority </p><p>Protestants.  The journalists originally received these </p><p>documents from Vietnamese Protestant sources, who could </p><p>often not provide a firm indication whether they had any </p><p>personal knowledge of the events detailed in these accounts </p><p>or exactly how directly they had obtained the information. </p><p>Neither the Embassy nor the journalists themselves can </p><p>confirm the accuracy of these accounts, which are in </p><p>Vietnamese. </p><p> </p><p>Murders? </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  "Chong," the ten year old son of Protestant leader </p><p>Trang Phia of Hoi Cha hamlet, Muong Nhe village, Muong Nhe </p><p>District, Lai Chau province, disappeared three days after </p><p>Trang Phia and other church leaders had been told to leave </p><p>the hamlet and go into the forest (no date given). </p><p>Authorities initially refused requests by Trang Phia\'s wife </p><p>to search for her son, but later took her to a site (which </p><p>she had already searched) and produced Chong\'s body. </p><p>According to this account, he had been murdered -- church </p><p>members believe by a 35-year old Hmong at the behest of </p><p>local authorities seeking to punish the father -- at another </p><p>site and his body later moved by authorities.  Appeals by </p><p>church members to Hanoi authorities to investigate the case </p><p>have not produced any results.  Local authorities continue </p><p>to pressure church members to leave the hamlet, although </p><p>unsuccessfully. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Another account related the already familiar case </p><p>of Mua Bua Sinh (aka Mua Bua Senh) of Tin Toc hamlet, Phin </p><p>Giang, Dien Bien Dong district, Lai Chau province.  Mua Bua </p><p>Sinh died on August 7, 2002; his family believes he had been </p><p>beaten because of his Protestant faith. </p><p> </p><p>Detentions </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  Following the death of Mua Bua Sinh, his brother Mua </p><p>Say So went to Hanoi to try to convince central authorities </p><p>to investigate.  According to this account, he was detained </p><p>in May 2003, although it is not clear whether in Hanoi or </p><p>Lai Chau. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Mua A Chau and Thao A Tong, of Sin Ho district, Lai </p><p>Chau, were reportedly detained on March 5 in Binh Lu, Lai </p><p>Chau.  Mua A Chau was accused of having "resisted a person </p><p>performing an official act" in October 2002 when he had been </p><p>detained for three days, after authorities found in his </p><p>possession a number of appeals about religious freedom.  The </p><p>two were held in a detention center in Sin Ho district. </p><p>Tong was released after 15 days, but was supposed to report </p><p>to police on a daily basis.  Chau apparently remains in </p><p>detention (the date of the report was not given but was </p><p>clearly sometime after May 31) and other prisoners "allowed" </p><p>into his cell to beat him occasionally. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Sung Van Dung, a Hmong Christian from Hoi Dac </p><p>hamlet, Pa Ham village, Muong Lay district, Lai Chau, was </p><p>detained on March 8 after officials found Christian </p><p>materials in his sack.  He reportedly remains under </p><p>detention in Muong Lay. </p><p> </p><p>Renunciations </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  On March 3, about 100 police and soldiers came to </p><p>Xa Cat Village, Sin Ho District, Lai Chau province, to force </p><p>Hmong Protestants to sign a statement renouncing their </p><p>faith, claiming all evangelists were "false hands of the </p><p>U.S."  The report does not indicate whether the Protestants </p><p>complied. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  On March 2, police came to Che La village, Xin Man </p><p>district, Ha Giang province to force families to sign a </p><p>"commitment" not to listen to, believe, or spread illegal </p><p>religions; not to organize illegal gatherings; and not to </p><p>abandon ancestor shrines.  According to the report, anyone </p><p>who did not sign was arrested, but the report does not </p><p>indicate how many, if any, complied.  Whoever signed was </p><p>supposed to be given some financial and other assistance by </p><p>authorities, the report claimed, without indicating how many </p><p>benefited from this offer. </p><p>10.  (U)  A Yen, an ethnic Coi-dong from from Dak Ring </p><p>village, Cam Long district, Kontum province, was beaten by </p><p>police who were trying to force him to renounce his faith on </p><p>May 8. </p><p> </p><p>Fines </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  The materials also include copies of two receipts </p><p>for fines (of 100,000 VND -- USD7 -- and 200,000 VND -- USD </p><p>14) paid by individuals in Dak Lak province for having </p><p>organized "illegal Protestant gatherings." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  The religious life of most Vietnamese believers, </p><p>including Protestants, appears to be free from any official </p><p>pressure to recant; as long as they confine their religious </p><p>activities to their own homes or within one of the </p><p>recognized religious structures, they can practice their </p><p>faith without noticeable interference.  (The leadership </p><p>structure and even the composition of the clergy remain </p><p>under the supervision of the State and Party, however.) </p><p>Even many house churches usually also operate with virtual </p><p>impunity at most times.  Authorities nonetheless view all </p><p>other religious activities, especially evangelism, as </p><p>illegal.  At least in the sensitive Central and Northwest </p><p>Highland areas, officials have tried to convince ethnic </p><p>minorities to abandon such "illegal" practices; it appears </p><p>increasingly likely that they were not doing so at their own </p><p>initiative but rather as part of a larger drive to ensure </p><p>that all religious activities fit into one of the CPV/GVN\'s </p><p>boxes.  With a few very regrettable exceptions, these </p><p>efforts appear to have been non-violent, if still often </p><p>coercive.  Interestingly, however, it does not yet appear </p><p>that these efforts have been on the whole successful.  Most </p><p>knowledgeable observers would confirm the continued spread </p><p>of Protestantism among ethnic minorities in these areas </p><p>despite pressures to conform and even occasional harassment, </p><p>another sign of the dwindling power of the Party and State </p><p>over individual lives.  Septel will provide comments from </p><p>Party officials in Hanoi and refutation of these allegations </p><p>by provincial authorities in Lai Chau and Son La provinces. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
