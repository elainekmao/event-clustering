ANTI-PKK OPERATIONS IN ISTANBUL AND BINGOL </p><p>(Evrensel)  Police arrested Mehmet Hanifi </p><p>Gurdegir during an anti-PKK (KADEK) operation in </p><p>Istanbul.  In a separate operation in Bingol, </p><p>police arrested Gurdegir\'s brother Gokmen </p><p>Gurdegir and his cousin Dogan Gurdegir, both of </p><p>whom were "accused of membership in a terror </p><p>organization and organizational activities." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  FORTEEN-YEAR OLD ARRESTED FOR SEPARATISM </p><p>(Evrensel)  In Bismil (Diyarbakir), a fourteen- </p><p>year-old primary school student was arrested for </p><p>saying "Happy is he who says `I am a Kurd.\'" when </p><p>"Our Oath" was being sung.  The school principal </p><p>and teachers were reported to have beaten the </p><p>student.  The student may be indicted for </p><p>"inciting the public to separatism through </p><p>appeals to race." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  YOUTHS INDICTED </p><p>(Evrensel)  Sixteen Adiyaman youths have been </p><p>indicted for "membership in and support of a </p><p>terror organization (i.e., PKK/KADEK).  The </p><p>indictment followed the youths\' shouting pro- </p><p>Kurdish language education and pro-(PKK leader </p><p>Abdullah) Ocalan slogans during the May 1 Labor </p><p>Day celebrations in Adiyaman.  The Malatya State </p><p>Security Court will handle the case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  EMEP OFFICIAL\'S GRAVESTONE BROKEN </p><p>(Evrensel)  Military officials were reported to </p><p>have broken the gravestone of Tunceli Labor Party </p><p>(EMEP) official Abbas Tugrul, who had lost his </p><p>life in a car crash.  The words "He was the voice </p><p>of laborers" was written on Tugrul\'s gravestone. </p><p>The gravestones of two killed "guerillas" buried </p><p>in Pertek (Tunceli) had also been broken.  The </p><p>EMEP provincial chairman condemned the attack, </p><p>claiming the effects of the martial law and the </p><p>State of Emergency (OHAL) practices, in effect </p><p>(in the Southeast) for nearly 25 years, still </p><p>continue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  PUNISHMENT FOR KURDISH-LANGUAGE SONGS </p><p>(Radikal)  Five Diyarbakir teachers, all members </p><p>of the State Employees\' Union Confederation </p><p>(KESK) Music Group, have been removed from public </p><p>employment for having sung Kurdish-language songs </p><p>at the February Congress of the Teachers Union </p><p>Egitim-Sen in Diyarbakir.  Egitim-Sen Diyarbakir </p><p>chapter President Abdullah Demir called the </p><p>decision "unacceptable and inconsistent with </p><p>recently-passed laws."  Egitim-Sen will </p><p>reportedly appeal to the Regional Administrative </p><p>Court.  EVRENSEL called for withdrawal of the </p><p>dismissal, while the Human Rights Association </p><p>(HRA) called on officials to explain whether or </p><p>not Kurdish was banned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  DEATH PENALTIES COMMUTED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT </p><p>(Evrensel)  Following the passage by the </p><p>Parliament of the EU Harmonization Laws, the </p><p>Diyarbakir State Security Court has commuted </p><p>capital punishments given to 180 people for </p><p>membership in the PKK and Hizbullah to life </p><p>imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  MUS MAN MISSING </p><p>(CUMHURIYET) Varto (Mus) resident Sidik Kaya </p><p>disappeared on November 20, when he reportedly </p><p>left home to meet with local Jandarma official </p><p>Celal Sen following a telephone call.  The </p><p>Security Directorate and the local Jandarma </p><p>Command denied having arrested Kaya.  However, </p><p>Sen admitted having talked to Kaya regarding his </p><p>Turkish Health Insurance Card application, but </p><p>denied having telephoned him at home. Kaya\'s </p><p>father, Tekdemir Kaya, applied to the Mus Human </p><p>Rights Association (HRA) for assistance as he </p><p>said he was concerned about his son\'s well being. </p><p>Later, the HRA faxed a message to the Interior </p><p>and Justice Ministries, the Mus Governor and the </p><p>Prosecutor\'s Offices and called on Amnesty </p><p>International to respond urgently. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  PKK SUSPECT ARRESTED </p><p>(Turkiye/Cumhuriyet) According to the Hakkari </p><p>Governor\'s Office, Security Directorate teams </p><p>arrested Nadir Ciftci, who they determined to </p><p>have illegally sent two people to Iran in order </p><p>to join the PKK. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
