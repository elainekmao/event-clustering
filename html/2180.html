<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002967 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; EAP/K; EAP/RSP; INR/EAP </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02967  01 OF 02  140434Z </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, VM, KN, KS, DPRK </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM-NORTH KOREA:  RELATIONS CONTINUE TO THAW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  THE SRV/DPRK JOINT ECONOMIC, </p><p>SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE MET IN PYONGYANG FROM </p><p>OCTOBER 15-19 FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE VIETNAM OPENED </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA IN 1992.  WHILE PRESS </p><p>REPORTS TOUTED THE MEETING AS "HERALDING A COMPLETE REVIVAL </p><p>OF BILATERAL TRADE," THE RESULTS OF THE MEETING APPEAR VERY </p><p>MODEST.  THIS MEETING FOLLOWED A SERIES OF HIGH LEVEL VISITS </p><p>OVER THE PAST YEAR.  THE RECENT THAW IS IN LINE WITH </p><p>VIETNAM\'S GENERAL POLICY TO "BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE" AND </p><p>HAS NOT IMPACTED ITS THRIVING RELATIONSHIP WITH SOUTH KOREA. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>JOINT COMMITTEE MEETING REFLECTS "TRADITIONAL RELATIONS" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  IN AN OCTOBER 29 MEETING, NGUYEN THAC DU, KOREA </p><p>DESK DIRECTOR FOR THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MFA) ASIA </p><p>I SECTION, TOLD POLOFF THAT THE VIETNAM-DPRK RELATIONSHIP IS </p><p>"REALLY VERY GOOD."  HOWEVER, HE ADMITTED THAT WHEN VIETNAM </p><p>ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA IN 1992, THE </p><p>"TRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIP WAS STRAINED" WITH PYONGYANG.  DU </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SINCE 1992 THERE HAD BEEN ALMOST NO </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE, BUT ASSERTED THAT THIS WAS NOT DUE TO THE </p><p>POLITICAL COOLING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  RATHER, IT WAS </p><p>DUE TO THERE BEING "VERY LITTLE TO EXCHANGE."  ACCORDING TO </p><p>DU, A SERIES OF OFFICIAL VISITS THAT BEGAN IN 2000 SIGNALED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02967  01 OF 02  140434Z </p><p>A RETURN TO THE TRADITIONAL FRIENDSHIP AND INDICATED THAT </p><p>THE RELATIONSHIP IS NOW "RECOVERING STEP BY STEP."  THESE </p><p>VISITS INCLUDED: (1) THE SRV FOREIGN MINISTER\'S VISIT TO THE </p><p>DPRK IN APRIL 2000; (2) THE DPRK FOREIGN MINISTER\'S VISIT TO </p><p>VIETNAM IN AUGUST 2000; (3) THE DPRK SUPREME ASSEMBLY </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S VISIT TO VIETNAM IN JULY 2001; AND, (4) THE </p><p>OCTOBER 2001 JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE MEETING.  DU NOTED </p><p>THAT SRV PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG IS EXPECTED TO VISIT </p><p>PYONGYANG IN 2002, BUT HE COULD NOT PROVIDE A SPECIFIC DATE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>MODEST RESULTS FROM JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE MEETING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  DU DESCRIBED THE MEETINGS AS "VERY SUCCESSFUL," </p><p>BUT HE ADMITTED THE RESULTS WERE "MODEST" AND SAID THERE </p><p>WERE NO SIGNIFICANT OR VERY SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS SIGNED. </p><p>ACCORDING TO DU, THE TWO COUNTRIES DID SIGN A "COOPERATION </p><p>AGREEMENT" COVERING THREE GENERAL AREAS: </p><p> </p><p>--THE TWO COUNTRIES WILL "CONTINUE TO WORK" TO CONCLUDE AND </p><p>SIGN FIVE AGREEMENTS ON ECONOMIC COOPERATION, INCLUDING </p><p>INVESTMENT, SEA TRANSPORTATION, AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE </p><p>TAXATION, TRADE, AND BANKING; </p><p> </p><p>--THEY WILL SEEK TO COOPERATE IN OTHER FIELDS, SUCH AS </p><p>CONSTRUCTION, AGRICULTURE, TRANSPORTATION, FISHERIES, </p><p>HEALTH, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, CULTURE, SPORTS, AND TOURISM; </p><p> </p><p>--THEY WILL HOLD THE NEXT JOINT COMMITTEE MEETING IN HANOI </p><p>IN 2003. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02967  01 OF 02  140434Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  DU STATED THAT A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE MEETING WAS </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE, CURRENTLY RUNNING ONLY AT ABOUT USD 4 </p><p>MILLION ANNUALLY.  DU TOLD POLOFF THAT BOTH SIDES AGREED TO </p><p>"WORK SUBSTANTIALLY TO INCREASE" TRADE, BUT HE COULD NOT </p><p>PROVIDE ANY SPECIFIC FIGURES OR DEADLINES.  WHEN ASKED WHAT </p><p>PRODUCTS VIETNAM COULD POTENTIALLY IMPORT FROM THE DPRK, DU </p><p>CITED A CHEMICAL USED FOR CEMENT PROCESSING, AND CERAMIC </p><p>PIECES THAT SEPARATE POWER LINES.  DU INDICATED THAT MAJOR </p><p>ADDITIONAL RICE SALES WERE NOT LIKELY, NOTING THAT THE ISSUE </p><p>OF THE DPRK\'S USD 10 MILLION DEBT TO VIETNAM FOR A 1996 RICE </p><p>"SALE" HAD NOT EVEN BEEN RAISED BECAUSE VIETNAM UNDERSTOOD </p><p>THAT THE "ECONOMIC SITUATION THERE IS STILL VERY HARD." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  NGO XUAN BINH, DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR KOREAN </p><p>STUDIES, OPINED THAT PERHAPS PART OF THE RECENT INCREASE IN </p><p>BILATERAL ACTIVITY IS THAT THE DPRK HAD SEEN THE SUCCESS </p><p>VIETNAM HAD ACHIEVED WITH ITS MARKET REFORMS AND WAS HOPING </p><p>TO LEARN FROM VIETNAM\'S EXPERIENCE.  HOWEVER, DUE TO THE </p><p>LACK OF ACCESS TO THE DPRK, BINH ADMITTED THAT "IT IS VERY </p><p>HARD TO KNOW WHAT THEY THINK." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>SOUTH KOREAN VIEW-LITTLE FOR VIETNMAM TO GAIN ECONOMICALLY. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  A SOUTH KOREAN EMBOFF TOLD POLOFF ON OCTOBER 26 </p><p> </p><p>THAT THE GLOWING IMPRESSION GIVEN BY VIETNAMESE PRESS </p><p>ACCOUNTS OF THE MEETING WAS "OUT OF PROPORTION" WITH WHAT </p><p>HAD ACTUALLY OCCURRED.  THE MOST SENIOR OFFICIALS PRESENT </p><p>WERE THE VICE MINISTERS OF TRADE, AND THERE WERE NO </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS, HE CLAIMED.  THE EMBOFF </p><p>NOTED THAT "IN REALITY, THERE IS NO COMMON AREA FOR THE TWO </p><p>SIDES SUBSTANTIALLY TO INCREASE THEIR RELATIONSHIP" AND THAT </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TRADE IS UNLIKELY BECAUSE </p><p>ESSENTIALLY THE DPRK HAS NO MONEY AND VERY LITTLE TO OFFER </p><p>THAT VIETNAM DOES NOT ALREADY HAVE.  DUE TO THE DPRK\'S </p><p>EXTREME POVERTY, HE ASSERTED, THE ONLY POSSIBLE TRADE IS </p><p>"BARTER TRADE."  SUCH TRADE COULD POSSIBLY INCLUDE "RICE FOR </p><p>RUBBER OR POSSIBLY SOME MINERALS," ACCORDING TO THE EMBOFF. </p><p>CONTRASTING VIETNAM\'S RELATIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA, HE </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT, "VIETNAM CANNOT GAIN ANYTHING ECONOMICALLY </p><p>FROM THE DPRK." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>.BUT BETTER RELATIONS ARE GOOD </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  THE SOUTH KOREAN EMBOFF NOTED THAT SEOUL </p><p>NONETHELESS VIEWS THE RECENT THAW BETWEEN VIETNAM AND THE </p><p>DPRK POSITIVELY.  HE OPINED IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AN </p><p>OUTGROWTH OF VIETNAM\'S "DOI MOI" (RENOVATION) POLICY AND THE </p><p>DPRK\'S "DESPERATE" ECONOMIC SITUATION.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>EMBOFF, VIETNAM -- HAVING ACHIEVED SOME ECONOMIC SUCCESS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02967  02 OF 02  140434Z </p><p>SINCE "DOI MOI" IMPLEMENTATION IN 1986 -- IS PAYING MORE </p><p>ATTENTION NOW TO ITS POLITICAL RELATIONSHIPS.  SOUTH KOREAN </p><p>POLICY HAS ALSO PLAYED A ROLE, ACCORDING TO THE EMBOFF.  THE </p><p>"US OR THEM" POLICY OF THE EARLY 1990S HAS BEEN REPLACED BY </p><p>AN ROK POLICY THAT WELCOMES NORMALIZATION AND ENGAGEMENT </p><p>WITH THE NORTH, HE NOTED.  SIMILARLY, THE DPRK POLICY OF </p><p>CUTTING OFF EVERY COUNTRY THAT OPENED RELATIONS WITH SOUTH </p><p>KOREA HAS ALSO CHANGED.  THESE POLITICAL FORCES, PLUS THE </p><p>DPRK\'S DIRE ECONOMIC SITUATION, HAVE "COME TOGETHER" TO </p><p>INFLUENCE THE ONGOING PROCESS, HE DESCRIBED.  BINH, FROM THE </p><p>KOREA STUDIES CENTER, SEPARATELY NOTED THAT THE DPRK HAS </p><p>ALSO BEEN MAKING "SOME OVERTURES" TO SOME WESTERN EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES AND COMMENTED THAT "SLOWLY, THE DPRK IS TRYING TO </p><p>BECOME LESS ISOLATED." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>NO IMPACT ON VIETNAM-SOUTH KOREA RELATIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  DU AND THE SOUTH KOREAN EMBOFF SEPARATELY  STATED </p><p>THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA AND VIETNAM IS </p><p>VERY GOOD AND THAT THE RECENT WARMING OF TIES WITH THE DPRK </p><p>HAD DONE NOTHING TO CHANGE THIS.  THE KOREAN STUDIES </p><p>CENTER\'S BINH ALSO DESCRIBED THE SRV/ROK RELATIONSHIP AS </p><p>"VERY SOLID."  MOST RECENTLY, VIETNAM\'S PRESIDENT VISITED </p><p>SOUTH KOREA IN AUGUST AND SOUTH KOREA\'S INFORMATION AND </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER VISITED VIETNAM IN LATE OCTOBER. </p><p>SOUTH KOREA ALSO HAS AN ONGOING ASSISTANCE PROJECT TO BUILD </p><p>40 NEW SCHOOLS IN CENTRAL VIETNAM, RECEIVING FAVORABLE MEDIA </p><p>COVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02967  02 OF 02  140434Z </p><p>9.  (SBU)  COMMENT: THE FORCES THAT RESULTED IN THE COOLNESS </p><p>BETWEEN THE DPRK AND VIETNAM FROM 1992-2000 HAVE LARGELY </p><p>DISSIPATED, LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN FOR REVITALIZATION OF TIES </p><p>BETWEEN THESE "TRADITIONAL FRIENDS."  THIS PROCESS IS APT TO </p><p>CONTINUE ALONG ITS PRESENT MODEST BUT POSITIVE PATH, BUT IT </p><p>APPEARS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT BILATERAL ACTIVITY WILL </p><p>INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
