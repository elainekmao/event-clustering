<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000628 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ASEC, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC ELEMENTS STILL CONTEMPLATING VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 516 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On March 26, MDC Secretary-General Welshman Ncube </p><p>assured the Ambassador that the party remains committed to </p><p>peaceful change, while acknowledging that some party elements </p><p>had been planning bombing attacks prior to the March 18-19 </p><p>stayaway.  Solomon Chikowero, the MDC Head of Intelligence </p><p>said, however, that some in the party rank and file were </p><p>still prepared to launch violent action against the </p><p>Government, and were awaiting the green light from MDC </p><p>leadership to proceed.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador with MDC Secretary-General </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador, accompanied by Polchief, met on March </p><p>26 with MDC Secretary-General Welshman Ncube to counsel </p><p>strongly against the MDC\'s initiation of violence.  The </p><p>Ambassador emphasized that in addition to losing the high </p><p>moral ground in such a scenario, the MDC would be playing on </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s proven turf and could not win a violent battle with </p><p>the ruling party.  Ncube stressed that the MDC leadership </p><p>remains committed to peaceful change, saying that conducting </p><p>a war against ZANU-PF with petrol bombs would be suicidal. </p><p>He acknowledged that elements of his party had been planning </p><p>certain "insane things" prior to the stayaway, such as </p><p>bombing bridges and electrical installations.  When this was </p><p>brought to his attention, he immediately spoke with deputy </p><p>Secretary-General Gift Chimanikire, who supervises the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>party\'s intelligence and security directorates, and told him </p><p>to rescind any orders that might have been given for violent </p><p>action. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ncube said the party would not be ready to launch the </p><p>next phase of mass action when a March 31 ultimatum deadline </p><p>expires.  (Note: After the successful March 18-19 stayaway, </p><p>the MDC issued a list of demands the Government must meet by </p><p>March 31 or face further civil unrest.  End Note.)  The party </p><p>is now coordinating with civic organizations such as the </p><p>Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) and the National </p><p>Constitutional Assembly, and would likely need until the </p><p>second or third week in April to do the necessary </p><p>mobilization.  Asked what form the next phase of mass action </p><p>would take, Ncube said the party wanted to organize protests </p><p>that were sustainable and ongoing, not one- or two-day </p><p>affairs.  Prolonged stayaways and street demonstrations in </p><p>the high-density suburbs were the most likely actions.  In </p><p>the beginning, however, the MDC would not organize </p><p>large-scale demonstrations in the city center, in order to </p><p>minimize the possibility of security service attacks on </p><p>members of the public and to avoid gathering large numbers of </p><p>party activists in the same place. </p><p> </p><p>Violence - A Contingency Plan? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In a separate conversation with Poloff on March 26, </p><p>Solomon Chikowero, the MDC Head of Intelligence, said plans </p><p>for violent activities are in place and that they are simply </p><p>waiting for the green light from the MDC leadership, which is </p><p>to meet on March 28 to decide what to do when the MDC </p><p>ultimatum expires on March 31.  Chikowero said there was a </p><p>feeling within the MDC that whether they engaged in </p><p>stayaways, demonstrations, or more violent activities--the </p><p>response from the GOZ was the same: detentions, arrests, </p><p>beatings, tortures and rapes.  He expressed the sense of some </p><p>within the MDC that they had exhausted their options and were </p><p>left with only violent means to pressure the GOZ into a </p><p>dialogue on political change. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Chikowero suggested that parastatal Zimbabwe Unified </p><p>Passenger Company (ZUPCO) buses would be prime targets for </p><p>attack, and that avoiding injuries would be important. </p><p>Chikowero did not mention other specific targets, but his </p><p>subordinates had elaborated on this topic in previous </p><p>conversations with us (reftel). </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Poloff reiterated that if the MDC engaged in violence </p><p>that the U.S. and others in the international community would </p><p>have no choice but to distance themselves.  Organized </p><p>violence was not the hallmark of a legitimate democratic </p><p>political party.  Poloff suggested there were many other </p><p>peaceful ways to motivate political change.  Poloff suggested </p><p>that the recent stayaway had already bolstered Zimbabweans\' </p><p>confidence in their ability to influence political change. </p><p>Violent activities would only invite a more violent crackdown </p><p>on the part of government, as we saw in the aftermath of the </p><p>March 18-19 stayaway. </p><p>7. (C) Chikowero agreed in principle that non-violent </p><p>activities were a good idea, and that violent activities </p><p>could backfire politically, but he said that the final </p><p>decision would be made above his head.  He also said </p><p>non-violent stayaways and protests, though more desirable, </p><p>were more complicated to organize in a reasonable amount of </p><p>time, and according to him, less likely to succeed. </p><p>Chikowero said discouraging stone throwing was a lost cause </p><p>with MDC supporters on the street who have been beaten </p><p>repeatedly by security forces. </p><p> </p><p>Soldiers? </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Chikowero said the "soldiers" currently carrying out </p><p>the retribution campaign against MDC supporters are National </p><p>Youth Service members, "green bombers" led by war vets who </p><p>re-entered the military in 2001.  He claimed that none of </p><p>them are regular soldiers.  Chikowero said that his office </p><p>could compile a list of the war-vets cum soldiers, and other </p><p>information on which military units have supplied the </p><p>camouflage uniforms, military vehicles and weapons. </p><p>Chikowero was speculating, but he suggested that it was </p><p>likely the Joint Operations Command (JOC), which comprises </p><p>elements of the police, military, and Central Intelligence </p><p>Organization, was coordinating, or was at least complicit in </p><p>the operation. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) We believe that Welshman Ncube is committed to </p><p>achieving political change peacefully and hope that other </p><p>senior MDC leaders share this view.  His obvious discomfort </p><p>in discussing this topic, however, raises some question about </p><p>the commitment of other MDC leaders to the path of </p><p>non-violence.  It is noteworthy, that the MDC has issued no </p><p>public statement condemning the sporadic violence that </p><p>occurred during the March 18-19 stayaway.  Such a statement </p><p>would send a clear message to the increasingly frustrated </p><p>rank and file that the party was opposed to violence of any </p><p>sort.  Instead it appears that attacks on ZANU-PF interests </p><p>are being kept in reserve as a contingency plan, and </p><p>cultivated by lower-level officials and supporters who </p><p>themselves see few other viable options.  So far, those </p><p>elements have heeded the leadership\'s stand down orders, but </p><p>it is impossible to predict how long their commitment to the </p><p>party leadership will outweigh their frustration with the </p><p>regime.  We will continue to stress in our interactions with </p><p>MDC leaders our conviction that violence is not the way </p><p>forward. </p><p> </p><p>Who is Chikowero? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Chikowero is an impressive figure, a former Air Force </p><p>paratrooper and intelligence officer who served in Somalia, </p><p>Mozambique and various posts within Zimbabwe.  A military </p><p>court imprisoned him in 1991 for refusing to follow orders </p><p>during operations in Mozambique, which he described as using </p><p>junior soldiers as cannon fodder.  He was released in 1996 </p><p>and declined an offer to re-join the Air Force to instead </p><p>team up with the fledging MDC a couple of years later.  Since </p><p>joining the MDC he has been arrested about eleven times, and </p><p>tortured twice within the past year.  He said the tortures </p><p>have only hardened his resolve against the current regime. </p><p>He is widely regarded in ZANU-PF circles as being at the </p><p>center of plans for MDC-sponsored violence, and is watched </p><p>closely by the security services.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
