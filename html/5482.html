<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL -- J. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 DECL: 1/23/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: THE ALEX EKWUEME FACTOR </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (G). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During an extensive January 9 </p><p>conversation with Ambassador Jeter, defeated PDP </p><p>contestant Alex Ekwueme did not "recognize" Obasanjo\'s </p><p>convention victory. Ekwueme contended that Obasanjo\'s </p><p>victory was the result of bribes, political threats </p><p>and chicanery regarding the actual delegate voting. </p><p>Notwithstanding his displeasure, Ekwueme asserted he </p><p>would remain in the PDP but would retire to the life </p><p>of an elder, inactive statesman. Ekwueme described the </p><p>ANPP convention as even worse than the PDP\'s and its </p><p>selection of former Head of State Buhari as abysmal. </p><p>No self-respecting Christian would vote for Buhari, he </p><p>declared. His professions of retirement could not mask </p><p>Ekwueme\'s desire to stay in the game. Rankled by </p><p>Obasanjo\'s "thefts" of the 1999 and 2003 PDP mandates </p><p>and pressured by supporters, the former Vice President </p><p>will kick up as much dust as he can. On January 15, </p><p>Ekwueme publicly called for another PDP convention; on </p><p>January 23, he filed a lawsuit seeking his unlikely </p><p>dream of a second convention; On January 26, he </p><p>publicly suggested the formation of a broad </p><p>"coalition" of parties to combat the PDP.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>HE DID IT TO ME AGAIN! </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Taking a few days respite from the public </p><p>rostrum in the aftermath of the tumultuous PDP </p><p>convention, former Vice President Ekwueme emerged on </p><p>January 9 for a relaxed morning conversation with the </p><p>Ambassador at the CMR. After the meeting, Ekwueme </p><p>would start in earnest his initial round of post- </p><p>convention consultations with various advisors and </p><p>politicians in and out of the PDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) The reserved Ekwueme contended that the PDP </p><p>convention was blatantly unfair; as in 1999, democracy </p><p>and the will of the delegates had been hijacked by the </p><p>influence of money, he lamented.  His major allegation </p><p>was that PDP chairman Audu Ogbeh consorted with the </p><p>Obasanjo campaign by serially numbering the delegate </p><p>ballots. Convention voting was to be conducted by </p><p>secret ballot; however, by numbering the ballots, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>recording the numbered ballots given each state, then </p><p>having the delegates vote in alphabetical order meant </p><p>that any delegate\'s vote could be identified; at the </p><p>very least, a state\'s collective vote could be </p><p>determined.  Ekwueme maintained that this procedure </p><p>effectively eliminated the secrecy of the ballot. </p><p>Coupled with blatant political threats by the </p><p>Presidency, this caused many governors and hundreds of </p><p>delegates to change their minds.  People voted for </p><p>Obasanjo because they feared the consequences, Ekwueme </p><p>explained. (Comment: Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, Secretary of </p><p>the Independent National Electoral Commission, told us </p><p>that INEC had advised the PDP Chairman prior to the </p><p>convention against numbering the ballots. INEC </p><p>correctly thought the numbering would give rise to </p><p>suspicions of vote tracking, Baba-Ahmed recalled. </p><p>INEC observed the PDP and other parties\' national </p><p>conventions pursuant to its constitutional mandate to </p><p>monitor party activities. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ekwueme claimed he would have sought to </p><p>postpone the convention if apprised beforehand of the </p><p>numbered ballots. However, he had accepted at face </p><p>value PDP Chairman Ogbeh\'s pre-convention pledge to </p><p>ensure the integrity of the vote. Thus, Ekwueme went </p><p>into the convention confident the balloting would </p><p>truly be secret.  However, he was flabbergasted when </p><p>it was announced that Abia State, the first delegation </p><p>to vote, was given ballots numbered 1-95.  Ekwueme </p><p>sent supporters to find out what was happening.  When </p><p>they reported that the ballots were numbered, he felt </p><p>victimized by cruel deception. At that point, Ekwueme </p><p>had to decide whether to disrupt the convention by </p><p>walking out or to stay put and contain his frustration </p><p>and sense of betrayal. Ekwueme told the Ambassador </p><p>that his sense of decorum ultimately kept him seated. </p><p>Discounting remonstrations that his post-convention </p><p>criticism was nothing but a loser\'s lament, Ekwueme </p><p>said he did not regret his decision remain at the </p><p>convention. Walking out would have signaled surrender. </p><p>Moreover, Ekwueme argued that the timing of his </p><p>complaint could neither enhance nor diminish its </p><p>validity.  If the vote was unduly influenced, that </p><p>conclusion remained valid regardless of when the hue </p><p>and cry was raised. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ekwueme mentioned other problems with the </p><p>balloting.  Customarily, contestants appear in </p><p>alphabetical order on the ballot paper. This time, the </p><p>President appeared first despite his surname. </p><p>Additionally, Senator Ike Nwachukwu remained on the </p><p>ballot although he had defected to the NDP (and would </p><p>become that party\'s presidential nominee.)  Ekwueme </p><p>and Nwachukwu were next to each other on the ballot. </p><p>Because the PDP used photographs of both men in </p><p>traditional Igbo attire, the two challengers may have </p><p>looked the same on the ballot, a potential source of </p><p>confusion for delegates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: Ekwueme was correct that he appeared </p><p>to be ahead early in the convention and that money, </p><p>blandishments and political threats turned his once </p><p>firm position into dust. However, numbered ballots </p><p>were not his downfall. The change had taken place </p><p>before then, on Saturday when VP Atiku let everyone </p><p>know his lot was cast with Obasanjo.  Atiku controlled </p><p>the key governors who, in turn, controlled the </p><p>delegates. With Atiku back in line, the vote would </p><p>become a formality, the numbered ballots a form of </p><p>unneeded insurance. Moreover, Ekwueme\'s accusations </p><p>downplay some important facts. Ekwueme\'s campaign was </p><p>not pristine.  Credible reports indicate that his </p><p>supporters were not above giving delegates money and </p><p>making promises in exchange for support.  If Ekwueme\'s </p><p>team had possessed the tools of political </p><p>intimidation, it probably would have used them. </p><p>Ekwueme played the game but he simply could not play </p><p>it as hard as Obasanjo; thus, it is insufficient to </p><p>state that convention delegates succumbed to </p><p>enticement and coercion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Comment Cont: Moreover, the total number of </p><p>ballots nullified because Nwachukwu\'s name was </p><p>selected numbered fewer than 20. Obasanjo defeated </p><p>Ekwueme by nearly 2000 votes.  In the final analysis, </p><p>Ekwueme entered the race late and briefly scented </p><p>victory because of widespread unhappiness with </p><p>Obasanjo. If Ekwueme\'s support had been firmer, more </p><p>delegates would have stuck with him despite the </p><p>pressure applied by Obasanjo. Last, one of Ekweume\'s </p><p>big problems was that many political elites in the PDP </p><p>did not trust him on the delicate question of </p><p>Nigerian\'s territorial integrity. Because Ekweume is </p><p>an Igbo, the historical specter of Biafra came into </p><p>play.  We have heard many politicians state that </p><p>Nigeria is not yet ready for an Igbo President. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Finally, Ekwueme acknowledged that his failure </p><p>to persuade Atiku to abandon Obasanjo was a severe </p><p>blow.  He and Atiku passed messages several times </p><p>during the convention, with Ekwueme offering Atiku the </p><p>second spot on his ticket.  At first, Atiku apparently </p><p>wanted to run himself but was precluded because he </p><p>never filed a nomination form, Ekwueme told the </p><p>Ambassador.  Atiku then seemed ready to explore </p><p>teaming with Ekwueme.  Denying press reports that he </p><p>tried to seduce Atiku by pledging to retire in mid- </p><p>term, Ekwueme said his desire would have been to </p><p>resign from the Presidency around his 74th birthday </p><p>(November 2006) with 5-6 months left in office.  He </p><p>would have done all he could by then, he offered.  In </p><p>stepping aside, he would make room for a smooth </p><p>transition by making it clear he would not seek re- </p><p>election.  (Comment: No matter how the scheme is </p><p>described or what motives are ascribed, the practical </p><p>result of an early resignation would be Atiku </p><p>ascending to the Presidency and running as the </p><p>incumbent in 2007. There is no way around the fact </p><p>that Ekwueme dangled the early retirement option to </p><p>entice Atiku.   End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In the end, Atiku was too frightened that </p><p>Obasanjo would destroy him politically, Ekwueme </p><p>believed.  The former Vice President also discounted </p><p>rumors that NSA Aliyu Mohammed had been a potential </p><p>running mate.  Ekwueme stated that he never talked to </p><p>Mohammed about this possibility.  He attributed the </p><p>speculation of a link between him and Mohammed to the </p><p>latter\'s close ties with former Head of State </p><p>Babangida.  Ekwueme said he had received tentative </p><p>support from Babangida but very strong support from </p><p>former Head of State Abdulsalami Abubakar, Babangida\'s </p><p>close friend.  Ekwueme observed that Babangida\'s </p><p>support was lukewarm because of Babangida\'s obsession </p><p>for maintaining all his options for as long as </p><p>possible.  Babangida hated to choose a sole course of </p><p>action unless absolutely sure of success.  While this </p><p>craftiness might work in military government, it was </p><p>not well suited for a more democratic environment </p><p>where others, simply by acting, took advantage of the </p><p>space opened by Babangida\'s indecision. (Comment: In </p><p>the end, Ekwueme was abandoned by Babangida and </p><p>Abdulsalami who was conveniently abroad during the PDP </p><p>convention. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ANPP TO THE RESCUE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Both Obasanjo and the PDP were politically </p><p>wounded by the conduct of the convention.  However, </p><p>the ANPP convention helped salve those wounds.  First, </p><p>the ANPP erred by trying to force through a </p><p>"consensus" candidate who was the choice of the ANPP </p><p>governors rather than the party\'s grassroots.  Ekwueme </p><p>chuckled that the ANPP confab was made to look more </p><p>contrived than the PDP when the Southern candidates </p><p>left after the ANPP hierarchy had tapped Buhari. </p><p>Moreover, Buhari\'s selection made matters worst by </p><p>confirming the widespread impression that the ANPP was </p><p>Northern dominated.  Marking Buhari a religious bigot, </p><p>Ekwueme said no decent Christian would vote for him. </p><p>Ekwueme did not think Buhari had a chance of winning </p><p>because he lacked support in the South and his running </p><p>mate Chuba Okagidbo would not attract much. Ekwueme </p><p>commented that, although he would not campaign </p><p>actively for Obasanjo, he would vote for the President </p><p>not Buhari. Still, Ekwueme rued that Nigeria\'s two </p><p>main parties had settled on two former military </p><p>leaders with autocratic dispositions.  With the </p><p>emergence of Buhari, Ekwueme feared the presidential </p><p>campaign could acquire combative religious, regional </p><p>and ethnic overtones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>WHAT NEXT GENTLEMAN ALEX </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Although not ready to toss his towel into the </p><p>ring and publicly concede victory to Obasanjo, Ekwueme </p><p>told the Ambassador that he would withdraw from active </p><p>politics, return to Anambra state and "do nothing" for </p><p>a while. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Despite the clear statement that he would </p><p>retire,  Ekwueme did not appear ready to leave the </p><p>playing field. His quiet demeanor could not mask the </p><p>fight still left in him. After having lost two </p><p>consecutive conventions to Obasanjo, it should not be </p><p>surprising that Ekwueme would harbor resentment and </p><p>might be planning ways to scuttle Obasanjo\'s </p><p>ambitions.  Instead of an early retirement, we believe </p><p>Ekwueme will do his best to stir the pot, either to </p><p>win concessions from the PDP or, as a last resort, to </p><p>strengthen the challenge that other parties may </p><p>present the President. Recent events have borne out </p><p>these expectations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Earlier this month, Ekwueme filed a lawsuit </p><p>seeking a second convention; few people give this </p><p>quixotic lawsuit a chance. Trying to increase the </p><p>political pressure on the PDP, Ekwueme told supporters </p><p>after meeting the UNPP\'s flagbearer Senator Jim </p><p>Nwobodo in Enugu that Nigerians should "make the </p><p>necessary sacrifice to get the country back on the </p><p>track of democracy."  "Sacrifice could come in </p><p>different ways, including the formation of coalitions </p><p>by the political parties to ensure that democracy was </p><p>achieved in the country," Ekwueme reportedly said. </p><p>While Ekwueme probably does not intend to campaign </p><p>against Obasanjo, he is sending a signal to the </p><p>President that he must not be ignored. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) While many think Ekwueme will bolt from the </p><p>PDP, it is more likely that he may be fishing for </p><p>political concessions from Obasanjo, such as </p><p>appointments for key supporters. This is something </p><p>Ekwueme did not do in 1999.  If this is his ploy and </p><p>if successful, it will enable him to maintain </p><p>influence in the party and the government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Ekwueme\'s actions have little leverage unless </p><p>they carry the implicit threat that he might defect. </p><p>Thus, defection remains possible. During his </p><p>conversation with the Ambassador, Ekwueme downplayed </p><p>his relationship with Babangida and NSA Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed. He might be working more closely with them </p><p>than he would have us believe. However, Ekwueme is not </p><p>a Babangida fan; their relationship would be an anti- </p><p>Obasanjo marriage of convenience that Ekwueme would </p><p>have no pride in acknowledging. Babangida and Mohammed </p><p>may or may not have encouraged Ekwueme to file the </p><p>lawsuit.  However, they probably will encourage </p><p>Ekwueme to leave the PDP if the suit fails.  Babangida </p><p>neither wants Atiku to be Vice President nor does he </p><p>want Buhari to become head of State in 2003. Thus, IBB </p><p>must find a credible alternative. Alex Ekwueme could </p><p>help forge one if not become that alternative himself. </p><p>While his mind knows that challenging Obasanjo in the </p><p>general election would be a steep challenge, Ekwueme </p><p>could be persuaded to become a leading member of an </p><p>anti-Obasanjo coalition if he does not receive some </p><p>political concessions from the PDP. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
