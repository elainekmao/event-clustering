<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 LONDON 16998 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KPRP, PTER, PGOV, MARR, MCAP, UK, EI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NORTHERN IRELAND - CONTROLLING THE VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) LONDON 16351  B) LONDON 5653 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE RECENT ESCALATION OF IRA ATTACKS, </p><p>WHICH HAVE INCLUDED NOT ONLY MORE KILLINGS IN NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND BUT ALSO BOMBINGS AT UK MILITARY BASES IN </p><p>CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND THE FIRST BOMBING IN BRITAIN </p><p>ITSELF SINCE 1984, HAVE CAUSED HMG TO REEXAMINE ITS </p><p>EFFORTS TO CONTROL IRA TERRORISM.  THE INITIAL PROGNOSIS </p><p>BY OFFICIALS IN LONDON IS THAT THERE IS NOT A GREAT DEAL </p><p>MORE THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE SHORT TERM OTHER THAN TO </p><p>INCREASE ALERT LEVELS AND OTHER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS AT MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, KEY </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICES, AND OTHER LIKELY IRA TARGETS. </p><p> </p><p>THE IRA MIGHT BE PLANNING ATTACKS DIRECTLY AGAINST OR TO </p><p>COINCIDE WITH CERTAIN UPCOMING EVENTS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE CORONER\'S INQUEST IN GIBRLATAR INTO THE </p><p>KILLING THERE OF THREE IRA TERRORISTS LAST JANUARY, AND </p><p>THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONFERENCE AT BRIGHTON IN OCTOBER. </p><p> </p><p>THE ATTACKS HAVE NOT WEAKENED THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESOLVE </p><p>TO CONTINUE WITH ITS CURRENT POLICIES, WHICH INCLUDE </p><p>TRYING TO RECTIFY CATHOLIC GRIEVANCES IN NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND.  THERE HAVE BEEN NEW DEMANDS TO INCREASE UK </p><p>MILITARY FORCES IN ULSTER AND TO REINTRODUCE THE </p><p>PREVENTIVE INTERNMENT OF KNOWN IRA ACTIVISTS; THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HOPES THESE STEPS WILL NOT BE NECESSARY AND </p><p>FOR NOW HAS NO SUCH PLANS. </p><p> </p><p>UK OFFICIALS ARE PLEASED WITH PROGRESS IN GAINING THE </p><p>COOPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT IN DUBLIN IN THE FIGHT </p><p>AGAINST THE IRA, BUT ALSO ARE CONVINCED THAT THE IRISH </p><p>REPUBLIC COULD DO MORE TO HELP.  PERHAPS THE SHOCK OF </p><p>THE CURRENT WAVE OF ATTACKS, SAYS HMG, WILL ACCELERATE </p><p>THE IMPROVEMENT IN SECURITY COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS.  LONDON HOPES THAT IMPROVED INTRA-EUROPEAN </p><p>COOPERATION IN COMBATTING TERRORISM WILL HELP TO </p><p>MINIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IRA ATTACKS ON BRITISH </p><p>MILITARY FORCES STATIONED IN EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE IRA PLAYS TO THE NEWS AND CHALLENGES LONDON TO REACT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>3.  THE RECENT ESCALATION OF TERRORIST ATTACKS BY THE </p><p>IRA, INCLUDING BOMBINGS OF UK MILITARY TARGETS IN </p><p>CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND THE FIRST IRA BOMBING IN BRITAIN </p><p>ITSELF IN FOUR YEARS, HAS REFOCUSED ATTENTIONS IN </p><p>WHITEHALL ON THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING IRA TERRORISM. </p><p>WHAT THE KILLINGS BY THE IRA HAVE NOT DONE IS UNDERMINE </p><p>EITHER THE THATCHER GOVERNMENT\'S RESOLVE TO STICK TO ITS </p><p>POLICIES ON NORTHERN IRELAND OR THE CONSERVATIVE </p><p>POLITICAL CONSENSUS BEHIND THOSE POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AND HMG POLICE OFFICIALS </p><p>CALCULATE THAT THE IRA PLANS ITS ATTACKS MAINLY FOR NEWS </p><p>VALUE.  SPOKESMEN FOR THE IRA AND ITS POLITICAL WING, </p><p>SINN FEIN, HAVE CONFIRMED THIS IN RECENT INTERVIEWS WITH </p><p>JOURNALISTS.  THE IRA WANTS ITS ATTACKS TO SHOCK THE </p><p>PUBLIC IN BRITAIN AND WEAR DOWN BRITISH DETERMINATION TO </p><p>STAY IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE UK SUNDAY NEWSPAPER "THE </p><p>OBSERVER" REPORTED ON AUGUST 7 THAT IRA SOURCES TOLD ITS </p><p>REPORTERS THE AUGUST 1 BOMBING OF AN ARMY DEPOT IN </p><p>LONDON (REFTEL A) WAS UNDERTAKEN ON THE BORDER OF PRIME </p><p>MINISTER THATCHER\'S OWN PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCY WITH </p><p>THE HOPES THAT IT WOULD KILL MANY SOLDIERS (ONE DIED IN </p><p>THE BLAST) AND FORCE MRS. THATCHER TO RETURN EARLY FROM </p><p>HER AUSTRALIA VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE BOMBINGS HAVE EMBARASSED THE GOVERNMENT BUT NOT </p><p>NEARLY SO MUCH AS THE IRA APPARENTLY WOULD LIKE.  SO </p><p>FAR, IT HAS STIFFENED RATHER THAN WEAKENED LONDON\'S </p><p>RESOLVE.  AND, WHILE THE KILLINGS HAVE SCORED INTENSIVE </p><p>NEWS COVERAGE, THEY PROBABLY HAVE NOT INCREASED </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY THE NUMBERS OF BRITONS WHO AGREE WITH THE </p><p>"TIME TO GO" MOVEMENT FOR A BRITISH WITHDRAWAL FROM </p><p>ULSTER.  THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS THAT MANY ORDINARY </p><p>CITIZENS DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY MILITARY INSTALLATIONS </p><p>AND OTHER POTENTIAL TERRORIST TARGETS CANNOT BE </p><p>PROTECTED BETTER.  IN UK TELEVISION INTERVIEWS, SEVERAL </p><p>PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR THE NORTH LONDON ARMY BASE ATTACKED </p><p>ON AUGUST 1 SAID THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN AMAZED THAT </p><p>SECURITY WAS SO LAX AT THE BASE.  BUT MANY OTHER </p><p>BRITONS, EVEN WHILE THEY WINCE AT EACH DAY\'S TALLY OF </p><p>BOMBING VICTIMS, DO NOT EXPECT THEIR GOVERNMENT TO BE </p><p>ABLE TO FEND OFF TERRORISTS EVERY TIME.  THEY APPEAR TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND, AS EX-PRIME MINISTER STANLEY BALDWIN TOLD </p><p>THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN 1932, THAT DESPITE ANY </p><p>PRECAUTIONS "THE BOMBER WILL ALWAYS GET THROUGH." </p><p> </p><p>THE ESCALATION WAS EXPECTED </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>6.  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND TOM KING </p><p>DECLARED IN LATE JULY THAT THE IRA WAS BECOMING </p><p>INCREASINGLY "INCOMPETENT," AS EVIDENCED BY A SERIES OF </p><p>BUNGLED ATTACKS IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN WHICH INNOCENT </p><p>BYSTANDERS WERE KILLED OR INJURED INSTEAD OF MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE SECURITY FORCES.  THE RECENT ESCALATION OF KILLINGS </p><p>CAME SO FAST AFTER KING\'S STATEMENT AS TO SEEM PROMPTED </p><p>BY IT.  THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE (NIO) TOLD US THAT </p><p>KING\'S PRONOUNCEMENT WAS OVERLY OPTIMISTIC AND WAS NOT </p><p>REFLECTED IN ANY RELAXATION OF VIGILANCE BY THE POLICE </p><p>AND MILITARY FORCES.  SECURITY OFFICIALS HAVE KNOWN THE </p><p>IRA WAS MERELY PAUSING AND WAS OVERDUE FOR A COME-BACK. </p><p> </p><p>7.  NIO OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT EVER SINCE UK SECURITY </p><p>FORCES REVEALED THEIR PENETRATION OF IRA COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>WHEN THEY KILLED EIGHT IRA TERRORISTS IN MAY 1987 AT </p><p>LOUGHGALL, NORTHERN IRELAND, THE IRA HAS BEEN HOLDING </p><p>BACK WHILE IT CHANGED ITS METHODS.  THE TERRORISTS HAVE </p><p>AMASSED TONS OF ARMAMENTS, CHIEFLY FROM LIBYA, BUT HAVE </p><p>BEEN FEELING THEIR WAY WITH NEW PROCEDURES FOR MAKING </p><p>AND COMMUNICATING DECISIONS.  THE KILLING OF CIVILIAN </p><p>BYSTANDERS AT ENNISKILLEN IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR AND </p><p>IN SEVERAL OTHER APPARENTLY BUNGLED IRA ATTACKS SINCE </p><p>THEN PROBABLY WAS DUE IN PART TO A DECENTRALIZATION OF </p><p>IRA DECISION-MAKING.  TO AVOID LEAKS AND INTERCEPTS, </p><p>LOCAL IRA UNITS WERE TOLD TO OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY.  SAS </p><p>AND POLICE SPECIAL BRANCH UNITS HAVE EXCELLENT </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SOURCES WHICH THE IRA CORRECTLY ASSUMES </p><p>INCLUDE "MOLES" IN ITS OWN RANKS.  THE SAFETY WARNING </p><p>FOR THE IRA, AND THE BOAST OF UK AUTHORITIES, IS THAT IN </p><p>NORTHERN IRELAND "EVERY TREE HAS ITS SPECIAL BRANCH." </p><p> </p><p>8.  AFTER MORE THAN HALF A YEAR OF PREPARATIONS, UK </p><p>OFFICIALS TOLD US, THE IRA PLANNED A SERIES OF ATTACKS </p><p>WHICH WAS TO INCLUDE THE GIBRALTAR BOMBING IN JANUARY. </p><p>THE FAILURE OF THAT ATTACK (REFTEL B) AND THE REVELATION </p><p>THAT ONCE AGAIN UK SECURITY OFFICIALS WERE AWARE OF ITS </p><p>PLANS PROBABLY CAUSED THE IRA TO DELAY OR DEFER OTHER </p><p>ATTACKS.  IT WENT AHEAD WITH BOMBINGS DIRECTED AGAINST </p><p>UK MILITARY PERSONNEL IN OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE, </p><p>APPARENTLY SECURE IN THE BELIEF THAT AT LEAST ONE </p><p>"ACTIVE SERVICE UNIT" EMPLACED TO OPERATE IN GERMANY AND </p><p>THE NETHERLANDS HAD NOT BEEN DETECTED BY EITHER UK OR </p><p>LOCAL SECURITY OFFICIALS.  WHATEVER ATTACKS HAD BEEN </p><p>PLANNED IN BRITAIN ITSELF PROBABLY WERE JUDGED TO BE </p><p>MORE RISKY AND WERE DELAYED AGAIN, BUT UK AUTHORITIES </p><p>WERE CONVINCED THEY WOULD OCCUR EVENTUALLY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  UK SECURITY OFFICIALS KNEW OF MANY IRA MEMBERS AND </p><p>SYMPATHIZERS IN BRITAIN AND WATCHED THEM AS CLOSELY AS </p><p>POSSIBLE.  BUT WHEN THE ATTACK CAME IN NORTH LONDON ON </p><p>AUGUST 1 IT WAS BY A "SLEEPER," AN INDIVIDUAL OR A UNIT </p><p>OF THE IRA NOT KNOWN BY SPECIAL BRANCH TO BE IN ENGLAND </p><p>AND READY FOR AN ATTACK HERE.  THERE MIGHT BE, OF </p><p>COURSE, OTHER TERRORISTS IN BRITAIN PREPARING FOR </p><p>ADDITIONAL ATTACKS.  MINISTRY OF DEFENSE CONTACTS TOLD </p><p>US THAT A GREAT MANY DEFENSE INSTALLATIONS HERE ARE </p><p>"SOFT TARGETS" SUCH AS RECRUITING OFFICES AND URBAN </p><p>DEPOTS WHERE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO INCREASE SECURITY </p><p>PRECAUTIONS SIGNIFICANTLY.  IF A WELL-TRAINED IRA UNIT </p><p>IS POISED AND EQUIPPED FOR ANOTHER ATTACK, SAID THE MOD, </p><p>IT COULD WELL FIND ITS MARK. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNMENT FOR THE IRA IN ULSTER? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>10.  WHILE THERE MAY NOT BE MUCH MORE BY WAY OF </p><p>PRECAUTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN IN BRITAIN, THE SITUATION </p><p>IS DIFFERENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  SOME BACKBENCH </p><p>CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT HAVE REACTED TO THE </p><p>RECENT ATTACKS HERE AND IN ULSTER BY DEMANDING THE </p><p>REINTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT, THE IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT </p><p>TRIAL OR FORMAL CHARGES IN COURT OF KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>IRA AND OTHER VIOLENT GROUPS, BOTH CATHOLIC AND </p><p>PROTESTANT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  INTERNMENT WAS ADOPTED IN AUGUST 1971 WHEN 450 </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE IRA WERE ROUNDED UP BY THE ARMY AND </p><p>POLICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN "OPERATION DEMETRIUS." </p><p>100 OF THOSE ARRESTED HAD TO BE RELEASED BECAUSE OF </p><p>INSUFFICIENT INTELLIGENCE TO BE CERTAIN OF THE CHARGES </p><p>AGAINST THEM, SO THAT THE COMMAND STRUCTURE OF THE IRA </p><p>APPARENTLY WAS LEFT INTACT.  OPPONENTS OF INTERNMENT NOW </p><p>CONCEDE THAT CURRENT INTELLIGENCE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAT </p><p>A NEW ROUND-UP PROBABLY WOULD SUCCEED IN GREATLY </p><p>DISRUPTING IRA PLANS.  TOM KING SAID RECENTLY THAT THE </p><p>OPTION OF INTERNMENT REMAINS "UNDER REVIEW," BUT OUR </p><p>CONTACTS IN GOVERNMENT TOLD US THAT IRA ATTACKS WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO BE FAR MORE SERIOUS FOR THE OPTION TO BE </p><p>CHOSEN.  HMG KNOWS THAT ADOPTING INTERNMENT WOULD BE A </p><p>PROPAGANDA VICTORY AND A RECRUITMENT BOON FOR THE IRA. </p><p>ALSO, INTERNMENT VERY LIKELY WOULD NOT WORK UNLESS IT </p><p>WAS ADOPTED SIMULTANEOUSLY BY THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, </p><p>WHICH UK OFFICIALS REGARD AS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK WANTS MORE HELP FROM IRELAND </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>12.  UK OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT ONE KEY TO SUCCESS IN THE </p><p>WAR AGAINST IRA TERRORISM IS IMPROVED SECURITY </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND.  THEY THINK </p><p>THAT DUBLIN HAS NOT YET FELT COMPELLED TO PUT ITS WEIGHT </p><p>FULLY AGAINST THE TERRORISTS IN PART BECAUSE THE IRA, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH IT DECLARES THE DUBLIN GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>"ILLEGAL" AND THAT THE IRISH POLICE AND MILITARY ARE </p><p>LEGITIMATE TARGETS FOR ATTACK, HAS WISELY REFRAINED FROM </p><p>ENDANGERING ITS SANCTUARY ON THE IRISH SIDE OF THE </p><p>BORDER BY ATTACKING THE REPUBLIC\'S OFFICIALS AND ARMED </p><p>FORCES THERE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THERE WERE EVENTS IN 1987 WHICH EMBARRASSED THE </p><p>DUBLIN GOVERNMENT INTO GREATER ACTION, SAY UK OFFICIALS, </p><p>SUCH AS THE CAPTURE OF THE ARMS SHIP EKSUND AND THE </p><p>REVELATION THEREFROM THAT THE IRA HAD BEEN IMPORTING </p><p>LARGE QUANTITIES OF ARMS FROM LIBYA INTO IRELAND TO BE </p><p>USED AGAINST FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE SUBSEQUENT </p><p>FAILURE OF THE INTENSIVE EFFORT OF IRISH FORCES IN </p><p>"OPERATION MALLARD" TO FIND MANY OF THOSE ARMAMENTS, AND </p><p>THE PROLONGED INABILITY OF THE IRISH POLICE IN LATE 1987 </p><p>TO CAPTURE THE RENEGADE EX-IRA MEMBER AND RAMPANT </p><p>CRIMINAL DESI O\'HARE, THE POPULARLY STYLED "BORDER FOX," </p><p>EMBARRASSED IRELAND AND ITS SECURITY FORCES STILL MORE. </p><p>NIO OFFICIALS TOLD US THEY BELIEVE IT IS MORE USEFUL NOW </p><p>TO USE EACH ADDITIONAL IRA ATTACK, AND THE PRESUMPTION </p><p>THAT THE IRA TRAVELS RELATIVELY FREELY IN THE REPUBLIC </p><p>AND HAS MUNITIONS STORED THERE, AS ARGUMENTS TO PROD </p><p>DUBLIN INTO MORE COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>14.  AT A RECENT EC MEETING IN HANOVER MRS. THATCHER </p><p>ONCE AGAIN CONFRONTED IRISH PRIME MINISTER HAUGHEY OVER </p><p>THE NEED FOR DUBLIN TO BE MORE HELPFUL.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>CABINET SOURCES HERE, HAUGHEY CONCEDED THAT IRELAND\'S </p><p>POLICE AND MILITARY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO </p><p>COOPERATE FULLY WITH BRITISH FORCES IN STOPPING THE </p><p>IRA.  IN RESPONSE TO THATCHER\'S OFFER TO EITHER EXTEND </p><p>BRITISH ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT </p><p>OR TO ARRANGE SUCH ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IF </p><p>NECESSARY, HAUGHEY PROMISED HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD </p><p>REASSESS THE NEED FOR TRAINING AND OTHER SECURITY </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>NO END IN SIGHT </p><p>--------------- </p><p>15.  HMG OFFICIALS REGARD THE NORTHERN IRELAND PROBLEM </p><p>AS A PERENNIAL IRRITANT WHICH WILL NOT GO AWAY IN THE </p><p>FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  NO ONE WILL FIND A SOLOMONIC WAY TO </p><p>SATISFY THE CONTRADICTORY DEMANDS OF UNIONISTS AND </p><p>REPUBLICANS.  THE PERCEIVED GRIEVANCES OF BOTH SIDES </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CONFLICT.  WITH NO NEAR-TERM </p><p>SOLUTION IN SIGHT, THE PRINCIPAL GOALS OF GOVERNMENT ARE </p><p>TO KEEP VIOLENCE DOWN TO TOLERABLE LEVELS IN NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND, STOP THE SPREAD OF IRA ATTACKS TO BRITAIN AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE, AND RECTIFY THOSE OF THE GRIEVANCES </p><p>UNDERLYING THE CONFLICT WHICH ARE LEGITIMATE. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE GOVERNMENT IN LONDON BELIEVES THAT CONTINUED </p><p>IRA TERRORISM IS INEVITABLE.  THEY LIKE TO POINT OUT, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THE VIOLENCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, EVEN </p><p>WITH THE RECENT ESCALATION, IS VERY MUCH LESS THAN IN </p><p>THE PEAK YEAR 1972 AND IN MOST INTERVENING YEARS.  UK </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE CONFIDENT THEY CAN KEEP THE KILLINGS IN </p><p>ULSTER TO NOT MUCH MORE THAN CURRENT LEVELS WITHOUT ANY </p><p>INCREASE IN SECURITY FORCES THERE.  IRA ATTACKS IN </p><p>BRITAIN ITSELF AND IN EUROPE ARE A DIFFERENT MATTER. </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM TIES AND COOPERATION AMONG EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS, AND </p><p>THE UK IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE IRA CAN BE HELD </p><p>IN CHECK OUTSIDE OF NORTHERN IRELAND EVEN THOUGH ATTACKS </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR. </p><p> </p><p>17.  THERE ARE MANY EVENTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND WHICH </p><p>MIGHT BRING IRA ATTACKS, SUCH AS THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY </p><p>OF THE MAZE PRISON ESCAPES ON SEPTEMBER 25 AND SEVERAL </p><p>DIFFERENT DAYS WHEN CATHOLIC OR PROTESTANT ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>WILL BE HAVING PUBLIC MARCHES.  IN ADDITION, THERE ARE </p><p>SEVERAL UPCOMING EVENTS AND ANNIVERSARIES WHICH COULD BE </p><p>CONSIDERED AS POSSIBLE PERIODS OF INCREASED THREAT OF </p><p>IRA TERRORIST ATTACK IN BRITAIN AND EUROPE.  PROMINENT </p><p>AMONG THEM ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE BEGINNING, NOW SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 6, OF THE </p><p>INQUEST BY THE GIBRALTAR CORONER INTO THE KILLING OF </p><p>THREE IRA TERRORISTS THERE LAST JANUARY. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ANNUAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONFERENCE, OCTOBER </p><p>11-14.  THE CONFERENCE WILL BE AT BRIGHTON THIS YEAR, </p><p>THE SAME PLACE WHERE AN IRA BOMB CAME CLOSE TO KILLING </p><p>MARGARET THATCHER AND A MAJOR PART OF HER CABINET DURING </p><p>THE PARTY CONFERENCE IN 1984. </p><p> </p><p>-- 1989 WILL MARK THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF BOTH THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF BRITISH TROOPS INTO NORTHERN IRELAND AND </p><p>THE CREATION OF THE PROVISIONAL IRA.  1989 COULD BE A </p><p>BAD YEAR FOR COMMEMORATIVE TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>PRICE </p><p></p></div>
