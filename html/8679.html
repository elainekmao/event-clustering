(SBU) At two WFP Executive Board sessions (May 29 and </p><p>June 2), the Netherlands and Sweden criticized India and by </p><p>inference South Africa, Eritrea and China (WFP emerging </p><p>developing country donors) for contributing to WFP while </p><p>failing to adequately address hunger at home.  The Indian </p><p>ambassador gave an eloquent rebuttal reproduced below, and </p><p>both non-traditional donors and recipient nations round the </p><p>table heaped scorn on the Dutch and the Swedes. Given </p><p>unprecedented food aid needs globally, the United States has </p><p>strongly encouraged WFP\'s establishment of procedures for </p><p>"twinning" between those non-traditional donors who have </p><p>food stocks but cannot pay for transport and those donors </p><p>who are able to cover these costs. This major diplomatic </p><p>gaffe by the Dutch and the Swedes has brought the matter to </p><p>center stage. It is now time for the U.S. and our WFP </p><p>colleagues to put our creative hats on and make "twinning" </p><p>work. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Per ref A, India in October 2001 announced its </p><p>intention to donate one million tons of wheat through WFP </p><p>for Afghanistan. More recently, India has offered 50,000 </p><p>metric tons of wheat for Iraq and offered to pay shipping </p><p>costs to Um Qasr. Both donations have however run into </p><p>Government of India difficulties to pay full cost recovery </p><p>(FCR) i.e., internal transport, shipping and handling, </p><p>direct support costs, other direct operational costs, </p><p>indirect support costs presently fixed at 7 percent, etc. At </p><p>the Annual Board\'s discussion on WFP\'s Financial Policies </p><p>(May 29), the Indian delegate commented that FCR, as </p><p>presently structured, inhibited developing countries who </p><p>wanted to donate to WFP Appeals from easily doing so. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Both Sweden and The Netherlands saw meeting hunger </p><p>needs worldwide as the duty of OECD countries who were </p><p>obligated to address confirmed needs with appropriate aid </p><p>commitments (a variation on the mantra that all OECD members </p><p>are "obligated" to commit 0.7 percent of their GDP to </p><p>meeting the needs of developing countries). But they then </p><p>went further. India, South Africa, China, and Eritrea would </p><p>be better off, they opined, devoting their resources to </p><p>resolving their own domestic hunger problems rather than </p><p>seeking to become WFP donors. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Intervention of the Indian Ambassador on June 2 </p><p>E </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On the evening of June 2, under "other business" </p><p>the Indian Ambassador to the Rome UN Organizations, H.E. </p><p>Himashal Som addressed the Board as follows (text of the </p><p>intervention): </p><p> </p><p>(i) (SBU) "Mr. President, at the outset, I would like to </p><p>apologise to you because as much as I wish to be brief, due </p><p>to the fundamental importance of the issue that I will be </p><p>speaking about, I will take a bit of this august assembly\'s </p><p>and your precious time. I seek your kind indulgence. </p><p> </p><p>(ii) (SBU) In the past few days, there have been, for my </p><p>Delegation, some extremely distressing developments, that </p><p>throw into question the basis of our relationship - indeed, </p><p>the relationship of many developing countries like us - with </p><p>WFP.  At the Annual Session of the Executive Board last </p><p>week, some members stated, first obliquely during the </p><p>discussion on your Annual Report, and then - as if to affirm </p><p>that this is their considered position - during the </p><p>deliberations on financial issues, that WFP should be </p><p>selective in accepting donations from members.  Countries </p><p>must first ensure adequate food to their own populations, </p><p>they said, before they can presume to join the donors club. </p><p>When India - supported by several other countries including </p><p>the United States, the Russian Federation and some </p><p>developing countries - said that this was a surprising new </p><p>development in WFP - and something that was outside its </p><p>competence as a humanitarian organization - the members in </p><p>question reiterated their stance.  My delegation finds this </p><p>development pernicious and fraught with serious consequences </p><p>to the WFP in particular and to the ECOSOC system in </p><p>general. </p><p> </p><p>(iii) (SBU) Mr. President, you are aware that the Executive </p><p>Director, with full support of the Board, from Day One has </p><p>spoken about the imperative of extending the donor base of </p><p>WFP, about leveraging benefits for the poor, about garnering </p><p>resources from everywhere and anywhere to feed the hungry </p><p>children of the world.  Broadening the resource base of WFP </p><p>in order to meet the increasing need for humanitarian </p><p>assistance is one of the most important objectives of the on- </p><p>going review of the financing policy.  The entire membership </p><p>of WFP has participated in this exercise and encouraged the </p><p>Programme to explore avenues to mobilize additional </p><p>resources so as to extend its work to cover larger numbers </p><p>of needy people.  It now appears, however, that some </p><p>traditional donors are having second thoughts about </p><p>expanding WFP\'s donor base and about permitting entry into </p><p>what they consider as an elite donors club with restricted </p><p>membership.  My Delegation regards this as a totally </p><p>unwelcome development, creating by implication, as it would, </p><p>if successful, a division of the WFP between the rich and </p><p>the poor. Indeed, I would go further: we are strongly </p><p>critical of such expressions which perpetuate staticism and </p><p>vitiates against progress through means that we regard as </p><p>blatantly discriminatory. </p><p> </p><p>(iv) (SBU) Mr. President, never, to the best of my </p><p>Delegation\'s knowledge, has it ever been said in the noble </p><p>assemblies that constitute the ECOSOC family, that there </p><p>should be distinctions between sovereign and equal members </p><p>on the basis of degrees of wealth.  Never before has it been </p><p>suggested that the developing nations cannot be donors </p><p>because they have problems of development.  Yes Sir, India </p><p>has problems of food insecurity, but India is also one of </p><p>the great success stories of the Green Revolution.  From </p><p>being a country periodically visited by famines, India today </p><p>provides on an average 10 - 20 million tonnes of food grain </p><p>surplus annually, to have a stockpile of around 50 - 70 </p><p>million tonnes.  And this breakthrough in production is not </p><p>confined to food grains only - it also applies to fruits, </p><p>vegetables and milk. </p><p> </p><p>(v) (SBU) Anyone who knows the least bit about development </p><p>economics, will tell you that the problems of production in </p><p>a developing country are completely different from the </p><p>problems of distribution.  And these problems are compounded </p><p>when you have to reach food to a billion people spread over </p><p>3.3 million square kilometers in hundreds of cities and </p><p>towns and more than half a million villages.  It is a </p><p>problem linked to infrastructure, roads, silos and storage, </p><p>distribution depots and to state financing for the public </p><p>distribution system, as well as individual resource </p><p>capacities of a large section of the population who are </p><p>unable to buy food at market prices.  It is indeed a mammoth </p><p>problem - before which the problems of production, which can </p><p>be enhanced and indeed has been so done, through better </p><p>seeds, better agricultural practices, better irrigation and </p><p>improved agricultural financing, pale into insignificance. </p><p>It is perhaps easier to produce more food than to distribute </p><p>this equitably.  Indeed the problems of distribution - hence </p><p>of food insecurity - have nothing to do with food surplus. </p><p> </p><p>(vi) (SBU) You may be aware that India has one of the </p><p>largest public distribution systems in the world supplying </p><p>18 million tonnes of grain annually at affordable prices to </p><p>180 million families through a distribution network of half </p><p>a million outlets.  In addition, 15 million of the poorest </p><p>families are provided food grains at highly subsidised </p><p>rates, in our effort to create a hunger-free India.  The </p><p>Government has also ear-marked 5 million tonnes of grain for </p><p>food for work programmes and several schemes are in place to </p><p>provide a safety net for the weakest sections of society. </p><p> </p><p>(vii) (SBU) Mr. President, India today has sufficient food </p><p>grain resources to share it with those, who like us in the </p><p>past, do not have enough food.  In doing so, we are moved by </p><p>fundamental considerations which are the essence of our </p><p>democracy and our foreign policy.  We believe that the </p><p>social and economic problems of the world are indivisible, </p><p>that hunger in any one country affects us all - </p><p>individually, as nations, and globally, as human beings. </p><p> </p><p>(viii) (SBU) Today, I am proud to inform this Assembly, that </p><p> </p><p>there is a greater outflow of economic assistance from India </p><p>than is received from abroad.  For that matter, India </p><p>(which, incidentally, in terms of GDP of around USD 3,000 </p><p>billion, according to the World Bank is the fourth largest </p><p>economy in the world), has never been aid-dependent.  As the </p><p>U.S. Representative correctly pointed out last week, less </p><p>than 3 percent of all our total development resources have </p><p>come from external sources.  Indeed even at its height, </p><p>external assistance was less than 1 percent of our GDP.  We </p><p>are, Mr. President, most grateful for this support, at a </p><p>particular phase of our growth and at times of crises, but </p><p>now, I am happy to inform you, our Parliament feels that we </p><p>can graduate out of even this limited relationship and step </p><p>up our own aid to developing countries, especially those in </p><p>Africa and in our neighbourhood.  Towards this objective, we </p><p>are already in the process of pre-paying our external debt </p><p>to multilateral agencies and identifying several other </p><p>bilateral loans for closure, except for a few from countries </p><p>who have been traditionally most supportive and least </p><p>conditional.  South - South Cooperation has been declared in </p><p>our Parliament as one of our most important foreign policy </p><p>objectives and we are committed to spend more and more to </p><p>help our brothers in Africa and in our neighbourhood.  This </p><p>is no empty promise: in the last month we had the visits of </p><p>the leaders of Zambia and Mozambique to India and both of </p><p>them have gone back with pledges for very substantial </p><p>credits and technical assistance. </p><p> </p><p>(ix) (SBU) Pertinently, I would like to point out that in </p><p>its Consolidated Appeals for donations, the UN makes no </p><p>distinction among categories of donors.  It does not </p><p>classify donors as "traditional" or "emerging"; nor does it </p><p>lay down criteria for acceptance of donations.  Other UN </p><p>agencies too who depend on voluntary funding, do not </p><p>restrict donations to certain categories of members.  For </p><p>example, IFAD (the International Fund for Agricultural </p><p>Development), which depends on voluntary funding, obtains </p><p>more than 20 percent of its resources from developing </p><p>countries - a fact which the President stresses with pride. </p><p>IFAD members have never said "no" to the USD 15 million </p><p>contribution from India on the ground that India doesn\'t </p><p>have sufficient financial resources. </p><p> </p><p>(x)  (SBU) The recent developments in WFP leave us very </p><p>perplexed.  Is the attempt to keep out so-called "emerging </p><p>donors" part of a concerted strategy of a few countries - in </p><p>which case it will have to be countered appropriately at </p><p>every fora, at the Chancelleries round the world, at the </p><p>various U.N. specialised bodies, and if required, at the </p><p>ECOSOC itself - or is this the product of local initiatives </p><p>by some who wish to preserve WFP as their exclusive domain? </p><p>Forgive me for being so forthright, but what we have heard </p><p>in statement and implication, in the past few days - perhaps </p><p>we should have noticed veiled signals earlier - has been </p><p>deeply disturbing. </p><p> </p><p>(xi) (SBU) Let us remember that the donors\' club of WFP is </p><p>not like the World Trade Organization or the World Bank, </p><p> </p><p>participation in which carry very obvious benefits.  Do you </p><p>seriously believe that by rejecting donations from </p><p>developing countries, you can influence policy in those </p><p>countries?  Do you think India would ever accept conditions </p><p>to a donation that we are offering?  We recognise the </p><p>advantages, in terms of transparency and assuredness, of </p><p>channelling our donations through WFP, but we must remember </p><p>that both in India and in several receiving countries there </p><p>are strong lobbies in favour of the bilateral route. It has </p><p>been my constant effort to advocate the WFP route and in </p><p>this, I have received fullest support of the Executive </p><p>Director and his staff who have appreciated our problem in </p><p>meeting the principle of full cost recovery. </p><p> </p><p>(xii) (SBU) I would like to highlight the bizarre nature of </p><p>some donors\' objections by citing a parallel example.  India </p><p>has the second largest pool of scientific and technical </p><p>manpower in the world today.  Our capacity in the area of </p><p>Information Technology is widely acknowledged.  As a group, </p><p>persons of Indian origin are in the highest income bracket </p><p>of all communities in the USA.  I wonder whether the U.S. </p><p>would turn back Indian professionals on the ground that many </p><p>in India are still illiterate - in the same logic as is </p><p>being advocated here that since India has food security </p><p>problems, it should not be allowed to be a food donor. </p><p> </p><p>(xiii) (SBU) I have taken a lot of your precious time - but </p><p>I did so because I felt that if the logic of the arguments </p><p>expounded by some members against countries like India </p><p>becoming donors to the WFP were to be accepted, it would </p><p>lead to serious polarisation and politicisation within the </p><p>WFP.  This is a matter which can tear WFP apart.  It would </p><p>lead to unseemly and fractious debate that would only divert </p><p>our attention from our objective of feeding the poor and </p><p>hungry.  It would be a day of infamy if WFP, moved by </p><p>considerations advocated by the few, would shut WFP\'s doors </p><p>to new donors like India.  And, Mr. President, for what </p><p>reason - indeed what is our sin - that we offered to help </p><p>WFP with food donations? </p><p> </p><p>(xiv) (SBU) Mr. President, through you I would like to </p><p>assure our most dynamic WFP Executive Director that we have </p><p>no intention to weaken the WFP.  On the contrary, we want to </p><p>strengthen it by joining in with our small support.  Mr. </p><p>President, we in the developing countries - we in Africa and </p><p>Asia - may have hungry stomach but we have hearts full of </p><p>compassion.  We may ot have much financial resources,  but </p><p>we have te greatest resource of all - love and self- </p><p>respect.  We may be poor, but we are taught by our </p><p>civilisations to share what little we can spare, with those </p><p>who have even less.  The WFP, in this globalised world, has </p><p>been an inclusive institution, imbued with the most noble </p><p>objectives.  Let us strive together to achieve our sole goal </p><p>- to feed the world\'s hungry." </p><p> </p><p>End text of H.E.
