Meanwhile, Kilci says the PA </p><p>is "cleaning out" its portfolio by selling companies -- or in </p><p>some cases just their assets -- that have been under its </p><p>control for as long as twenty years.  Many investors/analysts </p><p>believe this government is more committed to privatization </p><p>than its predecessors, and therefore are hopeful that </p><p>positive rhetoric will translate into actual sales.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) New Privatization Administration (PA) President </p><p>Metin Kilci briefed us July 18 on privatization plans for the </p><p>rest of the year.  He began by stressing that, unlike in the </p><p>past, there is now strong political support for </p><p>privatization.  He noted specifically that Finance Minister </p><p>Unakitan, who now oversees the PA, is a strong supporter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Kilci argued that the Higher Privatization </p><p>Council\'s recent decision to approve the controversial sale </p><p>of petrochemical company Petkim to the Uzan family (reftel) </p><p>marked an important step forward because it demonstrated </p><p>convincingly to investors that the government was committed </p><p>to privatization, even at a political cost.  Kilci said the </p><p>PA was waiting to see whether the Uzans could come up with </p><p>the $240 million payment and "credible" bank guarantees for </p><p>the remaining $365 million (to be paid in three installments) </p><p>by the August 6 deadline.  He acknowledged that the Uzan\'s </p><p>successful bid had been embarrassing, since the family owes </p><p>the government hundreds of millions of dollars, and said the </p><p>PA had the legal authority to screen would-be bidders more </p><p>carefully. (Comment:  Most investors with whom we have spoken </p><p>commended the GOT\'s approval of the sale, saying the need to </p><p>show seriousness about privatization outweighed concerns </p><p>about the purchaser in this case. Some also wondered if the </p><p>GOT had approved the sale in the expectation that, given </p><p>other recent GOT actions against Uzan Group assets, the group </p><p>would not be able to come up with the payment to PA.  End </p><p>Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The PA\'s current focus is on the upcoming sales of </p><p>Tupras and Tekel.  According to Kilci, a number of foreign </p><p>and Turkish companies are interested in the companies, and </p><p>are now undertaking due diligence.  The tender process should </p><p>begin in September-October, leading to open auctions in late </p><p>October, though there is some flexibility on that date. </p><p>Kilci\'s goal is to finalize the sale contracts by the end of </p><p>the year (though he warned this could slip into early 2004). </p><p>In the case of Tupras, the PA will sell the state\'s 66 </p><p>percent stake, retaining only a "golden share" to guarantee </p><p>company sales of refined petroleum products to the military. </p><p>On Tekel, the PA will sell the cigarette (production and </p><p>distribution companies jointly) and spirits divisions </p><p>separately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Kilci said that the PA is also engaged in </p><p>"cleaning out" its portfolio, a move he believes is as </p><p>important as the Tupras and Tekel sales.  He complained that </p><p>several companies have sat in the PA portfolio for as long as </p><p>twenty years, during which time they have steadily lost value </p><p>while remaining a drain on state finances.  He is determined </p><p>to clear them out, even if it does not bring in substantial </p><p>revenue.  Last week, the PA opened a tender on six textile </p><p>factories owned by state company Sumer, and sold 3-4 of them. </p><p> It also has sold five pulp and paper factories, and is </p><p>trying to sell some facilities owned by meat packing company </p><p>EtBalik.  Kilci clarified that, where the companies have some </p><p>potential to operate in the market, the PA is selling them as </p><p>full companies.  For those companies without potential, the </p><p>PA is simply selling the land and other real assets and </p><p>liquidating the companies.  He noted that these steps have </p><p>provoked strong opposition from some Parliamentarians and </p><p>labor unions, but the government has instructed him to </p><p>proceed anyway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The PA\'s plan for 2004 is to sell Turk Telekom, a </p><p>number of electricity production and distribution companies, </p><p>and several sugar factories,  PA is now working with the </p><p>World Bank, the Telecom Regulatory Authority, and private </p><p>consultants to prepare a complete strategy for Turk Telekom\'s </p><p>sale.  If all goes according to schedule, the Council of </p><p>Ministers will receive and approve the strategy by the end of </p><p>October, so the tender process can begin by the end of the </p><p>year.  Kilci noted that the ongoing merger of cellular </p><p>companies Aria and Aycell (the latter owned by Turk Telekom) </p><p>was causing some delay, because the merger will affect Turk </p><p>Telekom\'s valuation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment:  After 2-3 years of positive rhetoric but </p><p>little action on privatization, the investment, business and </p><p>foreign diplomatic communities remain somewhat skeptical of </p><p>government promises.  On the other hand, there is a </p><p>widespread belief in the business/investor community that </p><p>this government is more committed to privatization than its </p><p>predecessor.  Given the PA\'s schedule, the government has an </p><p>opportunity in the next 3-5 months to prove itself on this </p><p>issue. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
