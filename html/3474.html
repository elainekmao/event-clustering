<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 007088 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PHUM, MOPS, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: FARC INAUGURATION DAY VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON.  FOR REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  ON AUGUST 7, PRESUMED MEMBERS OF THE FARC\'S </p><p>URBAN MILITIAS CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN TWO DIFFERENT </p><p>AREAS OF BOGOTA.  THE FIRST ATTACK, WHICH TARGETED A GOC </p><p>MILITARY INSTALLATION, WAS PROBABLY MEANT TO CONFUSE AND </p><p>DISTRACT THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY SERVICES. SEVERAL HOURS </p><p>LATER, THE FARC LAUNCHED A SECOND ATTACK ON THE INAUGURATION </p><p>SITE OF INCOMING PRESIDENT ALVARO URIBE VELEZ AS THE CEREMONY </p><p>BEGAN.  IN ALL, THERE WERE 27 EXPLOSIONS IN BOGOTA RESULTING </p><p>IN THE DEATHS OF 19 INNOCENT BY-STANDERS; OVER 70 OTHERS WERE </p><p>WOUNDED.  THE ATTACKS WERE WELL PLANNED BUT POORLY EXECUTED, </p><p>THUS SPARING BOGOTA FROM WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A CATASTROPHIC </p><p>EVENT.  MEANWHILE, FARC BLOCS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY LAUNCHED </p><p>SMALL-SCALE ATTACKS THAT CAUSED NO SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE OR HARM </p><p>TO CIVILIANS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>DIVERSIONARY ATTACK IN NORTHWEST BOGOTA </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AT APPROXIMATELY 1135 HOURS ON AUGUST 7 -- THE </p><p>MORNING OF PRESIDENT ALVARO URIBE\'S MUCH-ANTICIPATED </p><p>INAUGURATION -- SEVERAL EXPLOSIONS WERE REPORTED NEAR THE </p><p>JOSE MARIA CORDOBA MILITARY ACADEMY IN THE NORTHWEST AREA OF </p><p>BOGOTA.  IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY EIGHT </p><p>IMPROVISED MORTAR ROUNDS WERE LAUNCHED FROM A RESIDENCE </p><p>LOCATED AT CALLE 99A, 57A-15.  THE IMPROVISED MORTAR ROUNDS </p><p>DETONATED IN AREAS ADJACENT TO THE MILITARY ACADEMY AND </p><p>INJURED SEVERAL CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES WERE INITIALLY CONFUSED BY </p><p>REPORTS OF A GOLD BMW, WHICH WITNESSES CLAIMED DROVE AROUND </p><p>THROWING EXPLOSIVES.  COLOMBIAN NATIONAL POLICE LATER </p><p>SEARCHED THE ABOVE RESIDENCE AND DISCOVERED 100 METAL </p><p>LAUNCHING TUBES.  OF THE 100, ONLY 8 HAD FIRED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON PALACE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AT APPROXIMATELY 1510 HOURS, SEVERAL MORE EXPLOSIONS </p><p>WERE REPORTED IN THE AREA OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AT THE </p><p>START OF THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL CEREMONY.  IT WAS LATER </p><p>DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY SIX IMPROVISED MORTAR ROUNDS </p><p>WERE LAUNCHED FROM A RESIDENCE LOCATED AT CARRERA 26B, 4-44. </p><p>THE IMPROVISED MORTAR ROUNDS DETONATED IN THE AREAS ADJACENT </p><p>TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.  ONE LANDED IN THE PARKING LOT, </p><p>WOUNDING SEVERAL SECURITY OFFICIALS, AND ANOTHER ROUND STRUCK </p><p>THE FACADE OF THE BUILDING, CAUSING MINOR DAMAGE.  THE OTHER </p><p>MORTAR ROUNDS LANDED IN A POOR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD AND </p><p>KILLED 19 PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES SEARCHED THE ABOVE RESIDENCE </p><p>AND DISCOVERED 80 LAUNCHING TUBES.  OF THE 80, ONLY 6 HAD </p><p>FIRED.  ACCORDING TO ATF PERSONNEL WHO WENT TO THE SITE, THE </p><p>LAUNCHING TUBES WERE LAID IN CEMENT ON A BACK PATIO.  THE </p><p>PATIO WAS COVERED BY A CORRUGATED PLASTIC ROOF, WHICH </p><p>PREVENTED OVERHEAD SURVEILLANCE FROM DETECTING THEIR </p><p>PRESENCE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MILITARY AND POLICE SOURCES BLAME THE FARC URBAN </p><p>MILITIAS.  NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE.  ACCORDING TO THE ATF, </p><p>THE DEVICES AT BOTH LOCATIONS WERE IDENTICAL, IMPROVISED </p><p>MORTAR ROUNDS CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY ONE KILOGRAM OF </p><p>ANFO EXPLOSIVES ENCASED IN AN IRON SHELL WITH DIRECTIONAL </p><p>FINS WELDED ON.  THE ROUNDS WERE LAUNCHED FROM STEEL TUBES </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 2.5 METERS TALL AND 120 MM IN DIAMETER.  THE </p><p>WELL-MADE LAUNCHING MECHANISM FAILED ONLY BECAUSE THE FARC </p><p>USED A 12 VOLT BATTERY TO IGNITE THE CHARGE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE ATF, IF THE BATTERY HAD NOT FAILED, ALL OF THE MORTARS </p><p>WOULD HAVE FIRED.  MEANWHILE, IN BOGOTA AND THE SURROUNDING </p><p>AREA, COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES DEACTIVATED FIVE BOMBS, AND </p><p>NINE OTHER EXPLOSIVE DEVICES OR GRENADES EXPLODED WITHOUT </p><p>INCIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ATTACKS ELSEWHERE IN COLOMBIA </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  ACCORDING TO THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY, IN OTHER PARTS </p><p>OF COLOMBIA ON AUGUST 7, THE FARC DETONATED SEVERAL EXPLOSIVE </p><p>DEVICES, DESTROYED POWER TOWERS, BLEW UP PORTIONS OF THE GAS </p><p>PIPELINE, AND INITIATED COMBAT IN SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS WITH </p><p>THE COLOMBIAN ARMY.  THREE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES DETONATED IN </p><p>CALI, CAPITAL OF VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT.  IN ARMENIA, </p><p>CAPITAL OF QUINDO DEPARTMENT, FARC MILITIAS DETONATED AN </p><p>EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AND THREW A GRENADE THAT CAUSED SOME DAMAGE. </p><p>IN ADDITION, THE FARC DOWNED EIGHT ELECTRIC TOWERS IN </p><p>RISARALDA, ARAUCA, AND BOYACA DEPARTMENTS, AND BLEW UP A </p><p>SECTION OF THE GAS PIPELINE NEAR VILLANUEVA, GUAJIRA </p><p>DEPARTMENT.  THE SAME DAY, THE FARC INITIATED COMBAT WITH THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN ARMY IN ARAUCA, TOLIMA, AND CUNDINAMARCA </p><p>DEPARTMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE FARC, INTENT ON PULLING OFF A HIGH-PROFILE </p><p>ATTACK, UNSUCCESSFULLY SOUGHT TO STEAL THE SHOW FROM URIBE ON </p><p>INAUGURATION DAY.  WHILE THE MILITARY AND POLICE HAD </p><p>IMPRESSIVE SECURITY IN PLACE, THE FARC STILL MANAGED -- </p><p>PROBABLY OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME -- TO SNEAK AN IMPRESSIVE </p><p>AMOUNT OF MORTARS WITHIN ABOUT A KILOMETER AND A HALF OF THE </p><p>INAUGURAL SITE.  IN THIS CASE, LUCK WAS ON THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>SECURITY FORCE\'S SIDE.  THE RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>CATASTROPHIC HAD ALL THE LAUNCHING TUBES FIRED.  THE MAYOR OF </p><p>BOGOTA AND MANY OTHER OFFICIALS HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE PUBLIC </p><p>DID NOT "NOTICE" ANY ACTIVITY, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY SURPRISING </p><p>IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE MILITARY SCHOOL -- MIDDLE-CLASS </p><p>AND FAR MORE SETTLED THAN THE TRANSIENT NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p></p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
