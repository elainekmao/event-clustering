<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001251 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EU, IT, MARR, MOPS, PARM, PREL, AFGHANISTAN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN DEFENSE MINISTER ON ISAF/OEF PARTICIPATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01251  111215Z </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL M/C THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  ITALY MAY EXTEND ITS PARTICIPATION IN ISAF </p><p>UNTIL LATE JUNE IF REQUESTED, ACCORDING TO FRANCESCO GRECO </p><p>(PROTECT), DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO DEFENSE MINISTER ANTONIO </p><p>MARTINO.  GRECO CONFIRMED COMMENTS MARTINO MADE TO THE PRESS </p><p>DURING A RECENT TRIP TO VISIT ITALIAN TROOPS IN THE PERSIAN </p><p>GULF AND AFGHANISTAN THAT ITALY WOULD REMAIN "AT LEAST UNTIL </p><p>JUNE" TO ALLOW THE LOYA JIRGA TO TAKE PLACE IF OTHER EU ISAF </p><p>COUNTRIES AGREE TO EXTEND.  GRECO TOLD POL-MIL COUNSELOR THAT </p><p>MARTINO HAS SENT PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI A MEMO </p><p>RECOMMENDING THAT ITALY "REMAIN OPEN" TO EXTENDING </p><p>PARTICIPATION FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE MONTHS IN KABUL AND </p><p>BAGRAM ONLY.  NO FORMAL REQUEST IS EXPECTED OR NEEDED, GRECO </p><p>SAID; ITALY WILL ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE </p><p>ISAF MEETING SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 11 IN LONDON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DESPITE HIS STRONG RESERVATIONS ABOUT CONTINUED </p><p>ITALIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE ISAF MISSION, DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>MARTINO HAS RECOMMENDED TO PM BERLUSCONI THAT ITALIAN TROOPS </p><p>REMAIN IN KABUL AND BAGRAM AN ADDITIONAL THREE MONTHS IN THE </p><p>EVENT OTHER EU PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES DECIDE AN EXTENSION IS </p><p>NECESSARY, DIP ADVISOR GRECO SAID.  A TURKISH COMMAND, </p><p>SUPPORTED BY GERMAN AND BRITISH SUBCOMMANDS, IS ACCEPTABLE, </p><p>HE ADDED.  THE EXTENSION WILL BE DISCUSSED AND, APPARENTLY, </p><p>DECIDED AT AN ISAF MEETING SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 11 IN LONDON. </p><p>MARTINO MET WITH ISAF COMMANDER JOHN MCCOLL AND AFGHAN DEPUTY </p><p>PM/MOD FAHIM KHAN DURING HIS STOP IN KABUL, HOWEVER HE TOLD </p><p>THE PRESS THAT HE HAD NOT DISCUSSED AN ISAF EXTENSION WITH </p><p>EITHER OFFICIAL. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01251  111215Z </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MARTINO\'S TRIP TO THE GULF AND KABUL WAS PRIMARILY A </p><p>TROOP VISIT AND COINCIDED WITH A ROTATION OF ITALIAN ASSETS. </p><p>THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER "GARIBALDI" AND THREE OTHER SHIPS ARE </p><p>DUE BACK IN ITALY BY MARCH 20, AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED.  THEIR </p><p>REPLACEMENTS, THE DESTROYER "DURAND DE LA PENNE" AND THE </p><p>FRIGATE "MAESTRALE," ARRIVED IN THE GULF ON MARCH 4.  MARTINO </p><p>EMPHASIZED TO THE PRESS THAT ITALY\'S COMMITMENT TO OEF </p><p>REMAINS STRONG BUT THE SITUATION HAS EVOLVED SO THAT IT MAY </p><p>SOON BE POSSIBLE TO END OEF ALTOGETHER.  (NOTE: AS GRECO </p><p>NOTED, THESE AND OTHER COMMENTS HE MADE ON MARCH 4 LOOKED </p><p>PREMATURE AFTER THE FIERCE FIGHTING THAT RECURRED ON MARCH </p><p>5-6. END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) MARTINO, ALWAYS SENSITIVE TO PUBLIC CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>ITALIAN INVOLVEMENT IN MISSIONS FAR FROM HOME, TOLD THE PRESS </p><p>THAT THE THREAT FROM INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF TERROR IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>STILL EXISTS EVEN IF AL-QAIDA IS DEFEATED.  FOR THIS REASON, </p><p>ITALY MAY HAVE TO EXTEND ITS ISAF COMMITMENT BEYOND THE </p><p>INITIAL THREE MONTHS, HE SAID.  IF ITALY IS ASKED TO STAY ON </p><p>AND IF ITALY\'S EU PARTNERS IN ISAF REMAIN UNTIL JUNE, THE GOI </p><p>WILL CONSIDER AN EXTENSION, HE SAID.  THE GOI\'S HEAVY </p><p>COMMITMENT IN THE BALKANS -- A PRIORITY REGION FOR ITALY -- </p><p>WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CONTRIBUTE MORE TROOPS OR SUSTAIN </p><p>A LONGER PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN, MARTINO EXPLAINED.  (ITALY </p><p>ASSUMES THE COMMAND OF KFOR7 THIS FALL.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT.  ONCE AGAIN, MINISTER MARTINO MADE THE NEWS </p><p>-- AND SEEMINGLY NEW POLICY -- WITH HIS SPONTANEOUS PUBLIC </p><p>COMMENTS.  OUR CONTACTS HAVE ASSURED US THAT MUCH OF THE </p><p>MESSAGE WAS TAILORED FOR THE TROOPS HE WAS ADDRESSING.  THEY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01251  111215Z </p><p>ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BUSY RECONCILING SOME OF HIS </p><p>REMARKS WITH THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND.  DESPITE MARTINO\'S </p><p>TENDENCY TO VOICE HIS GENUINE RESERVATIONS IN PUBLIC, HE HAS </p><p>ONCE AGAIN UPHELD ITALY\'S COMMITMENT TO THE COALITION BY </p><p>RECOMMENDING AN EXTENSION.  UNLESS HIS EU COUNTERPARTS COME </p><p>TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION AT THE MARCH 11 MEETING, ITALIAN </p><p>TROOPS ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN IN KABUL UNTIL LATE JUNE.  END </p><p>COMMENT.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p>POPE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01251 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
