ZINDOGA\'S LOYALTY TO THE RULING PARTY, </p><p>ZANU-PF, IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE, AND HE IS RUMORED TO BE A </p><p>FORMER (SOME SAY CURRENT) AGENT OF THE CENTRAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO). WHETHER OR NOT ZINDOGA </p><p>IS GUILTY OF SUBVERSION, THE FACT IS THAT THE ZCTU HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03680  01 OF 05  070943Z </p><p>FALLEN DEAFLY SILENT UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP. REGULAR ZCTU </p><p>ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING LABOR WORKSHOPS AND TRADITIONAL </p><p>RECRUITING ACTIVITIES, ARE AT A STANDSTILL. IN THE RUN- </p><p>UP TO THE JUNE 24-25 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, THE ZCTU </p><p>FAILED TO JOIN CIVIL SOCIETY IN CONDEMNING PRE-ELECTION </p><p>VIOLENCE AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO VOTE. ISAAC MATONGO, </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE ZCTU AND CHAIRMAN OF THE MDC, IS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT UNIONISTS WILL VOTE ZINDOGA OUT OF OFFICE </p><p>AT THE NEXT ANNUAL CONGRESS, WHICH MATONGO HOPES WILL </p><p>TAKE PLACE IN SEPTEMBER 2000. UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, WE DO </p><p>NOT EXPECT THE ZCTU TO RE-EMERGE AS A CHAMPION OF </p><p>WORKERS\' RIGHTS AND A VOCAL STAKEHOLDER IN DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WITH BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT ON ECONOMIC REFORM. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>GOZ PLANTS A MOLE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ISADORE ZINDOGA, WHO WORKED FOR AND MANAGED </p><p>SEVERAL LEATHER PROCESSING COMPANIES IN ZIMBABWE IN HIS </p><p>CAREER, JOINED THE LEATHER WORKERS\' UNION (ONE OF THE </p><p>ZCTU\'S 35 MEMBER UNIONS) IN 1995. HE QUICKLY MOVED UP </p><p>THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE ZCTU, AND IN SEPTEMBER 1998 WAS </p><p>ELECTED TO THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ("THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE") AS DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL. (MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WAS THE ZCTU\'S SECRETARY GENERAL, AND GIBSON </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SIBANDA ITS PRESIDENT.) IN APRIL (SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE </p><p>LAUNCH OF THE MDC IN SEPTEMBER 1999), TSVANGIRAI AND </p><p>SIBANDA OFFICIALLY TOOK PAID LEAVES OF ABSENCE TO FOCUS </p><p>FULL-TIME ON THE NEW PARTY. THE ZCTU USED ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03680  01 OF 05  070943Z </p><p>PROMOTIONS TO FILL THE LEADERSHIP VOID. ZINDOGA, AS </p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL, TOOK TSVANGIRAI\'S JOB; AND </p><p>ISAAC MATONGO, WHO HAD BEEN FIRST VICE PRESIDENT, TOOK </p><p>SIBANDA\'S JOB AS PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AS SECRETARY GENERAL, ZINDOGA HOLDS THE MOST </p><p>POWERFUL POSITION IN THE ZCTU. HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL </p><p>OF THE ORGANIZATION\'S DAILY OPERATIONS, AND THE OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE AND GENERAL COUNCIL (WHO </p><p>REPRESENT THE 35 MEMBER UNIONS AND THE ZCTU\'S SIX </p><p>DEPARTMENTS) RECEIVE THEIR INSTRUCTIONS DIRECTLY FROM </p><p>HIM. ZINDOGA\'S LOYALTY TO THE RULING ZANU-PF PARTY IS </p><p>WIDELY RECOGNIZED WITHIN THE ZCTU, AS IS THAT OF </p><p>ZINDOGA\'S "RIGHT HAND MAN," SHANGWA CHIFAMBA, WHO IS </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE COMMERCIAL WORKERS\' UNION AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HAS BEEN THE ZCTU\'S FIRST VICE PRESIDENT SINCE NOVEMBER </p><p>1999. ZINDOGA AND CHIFAMBA, ALONG WITH A FEW OTHER </p><p>GENERAL COUNCIL MEMBERS, ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE SMALL </p><p>ZANU-PF "CAMP" WITHIN THE ZCTU, WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY </p><p>OF UNION MEMBERS SUPPORT THE MDC. ZINDOGA\'S CHIEF RIVAL </p><p>IS ZCTU PRESIDENT AND MDC CHAIRMAN ISAAC MATONGO. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE ZCTU PRESIDENCY IS NOT A FULL-TIME POSITION </p><p>AND NORMALLY IS CONSIDERED MORE CEREMONIAL THAN </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE, MATONGO COMMANDS SIGNIFICANT RESPECT AND </p><p>LOYALTY FROM ZCTU OFFICIALS -- LARGELY BECAUSE OF HIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5114 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03680  02 OF 05  070943Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------6B4528  070943Z /38 </p><p>R 070945Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6541 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 05 HARARE 003680 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S - ARLENE RENDER AND TODD FAULK </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/ROBERT SHEPARD </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/RALYEA AND NATAN EPSTEIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03680  02 OF 05  070943Z </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID WASHDC FOR AFR/SA - NAN NEWMAN, OTI - MARC </p><p>SCOTT, AND A/AID - RICHARD MCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2001 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PINR, PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SUSPECTED CIO MOLE RENDERS ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF </p><p>TRADE UNIONS INEFFECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>MANY YEARS IN THE ORGANIZATION, HIS LEADERSHIP ROLE IN </p><p>THE MDC, AND HIS CLOSE PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP WITH </p><p>TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BEYOND HIS OPEN SUPPORT FOR THE RULING PARTY, </p><p>RUMORS ABOUND THAT ZINDOGA PREVIOUSLY WAS AN AGENT FOR </p><p>THE CIO. SOME UNION CONTACTS ASSERT THAT ZINDOGA STILL </p><p>IS IN THE CIO\'S EMPLOY AS AN UNDERCOVER AGENT TASKED </p><p>WITH WREAKING HAVOC IN THE ZCTU. (ZINDOGA\'S WIFE IS A </p><p>ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE OFFICER AND REPORTEDLY A STRONG </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTER.) ZINDOGA AND HIS ZANU-PF CAMP DID NOT </p><p>SUPPORT THE ZCTU\'S NATIONWIDE "STAYAWAYS" (WORK </p><p>STOPPAGES) IN LATE 1998 TO DEMAND SALARY INCREASES, NOR </p><p>DID THEY SUPPORT THE FORMATION OF THE MDC. ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>WAS LARGELY NONCOMMITTAL IN HIS BRIEF MEETING WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03680  02 OF 05  070943Z </p><p>LABOFF ON JUNE 30, ZINDOGA NOTED THAT, IN HIS OPINION, </p><p>THE MDC HAD CONSUMED ENTIRELY TOO MUCH OF THE ZCTU\'S </p><p>MANPOWER, AS ZCTU OFFICIALS AT THE LOCAL, PROVINCIAL, </p><p>AND NATIONAL LEVELS DEVOTED THEIR TIME AND ENERGY TO THE </p><p>PARTY RATHER THAN TRADITIONAL UNION DUTIES. ZINDOGA </p><p>ADDED THAT HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO SEE WORKERS\' </p><p>DEMANDS ADDRESSED THROUGH TRADITIONAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN </p><p>EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES IN EACH INDUSTRY\'S NATIONAL </p><p>ECONOMIC COUNCIL (NEC), RATHER THAN BY FORMING A NEW </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY THAT WAS UNTESTED AND HAD NO EXPERIENCE </p><p>WITH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) LABOFF ASKED MATONGO AND ZCTU DIRECTOR OF </p><p>ORGANIZING JAMES MAKORE HOW ZINDOGA, A KNOWN ZANU-PF </p><p>LOYALIST, COULD RISE THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE ZCTU TO </p><p>BECOME DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL (AND THUS POISED TO </p><p>ASSUME LEADERSHIP OF THE ORGANIZATION), AT A TIME WHEN </p><p>UNION MEMBERS\' FRUSTRATION WITH GOZ POLICIES WAS </p><p>APPROACHING ITS APEX. THE ANSWER WAS SIMPLE, THEY SAID - </p><p>- CASH PAY-OFFS. SUPPORT FOR ZINDOGA WAS NOT DRAWN ALONG </p><p>UNION LINES, BUT RATHER FROM INDIVIDUAL UNION MEMBERS </p><p>WHOM ZINDOGA, WITH FINANCIAL BACKING FROM THE MINISTER </p><p>OF LABOR AND THE BLESSING OF PRESIDENT MUGABE, PAID TO </p><p>HELP VOTE HIM IN AS DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL AT THE 1998 </p><p>ANNUAL CONGRESS. (COMMENT: ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT ATTEST TO </p><p>THE VALIDITY OF THESE ACCUSATIONS, THE IDEA THAT ZINDOGA </p><p>PAID OFF THE RIGHT ZCTU MEMBERS TO HELP GENERATE VOTES </p><p>IN 1998 IS PLAUSIBLE, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING HIS </p><p>UNUSUALLY RAPID RISE THROUGH THE RANKS SINCE JOINING THE </p><p>ZCTU IN 1995. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03680  02 OF 05  070943Z </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>ZCTU RENDERED INEFFECTIVE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ACCORDING TO MATONGO AND MAKORE, ZINDOGA HAS </p><p>FAILED TO CARRY OUT HIS LEADERSHIP DUTIES AT THE ZCTU IN </p><p>A PREMEDITATED EFFORT TO BRING THE ORGANIZATION TO A </p><p>STANDSTILL. ZINDOGA, ON THE OTHER HAND, TOLD LABOFF THAT </p><p>IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO "RALLY THE TROOPS," </p><p>PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE ZCTU EXECUTIVE, AS THEY HAVE </p><p>BEEN DEVOTING SO MUCH OF THEIR TIME DURING BUSINESS </p><p>HOURS TO MDC ACTIVITIES. WHATEVER THE REASONS, THE FACT </p><p>IS THAT THE ZCTU HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY SILENT AND INERT </p><p>SINCE THE DEPARTURE OF TSVANGIRAI AND SIBANDA IN APRIL. </p><p>ZINDOGA AND MATONGO ADMIT THAT MEETINGS OF THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>-- ONCE A REQUIRED BI-MONTHLY EVENT -- HAVE BEEN FEW AND </p><p>FAR BETWEEN IN RECENT MONTHS, WITH EACH MAN BLAMING THE </p><p>OTHER FOR "SCHEDULING PROBLEMS." OTHER UNION CONTACTS </p><p>TELL US THAT ZINDOGA NO LONGER MEETS REGULARLY WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE ZCTU\'S 35 MEMBER UNIONS, AND </p><p>THAT HE PROVIDES VIRTUALLY NO INSTRUCTION OR FEEDBACK TO </p><p>THE ZCTU\'S SIX OPERATIONAL DEPARTMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO MATONGO AND MAKORE IS </p><p>ZINDOGA\'S CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH FLORENCE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5115 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03680  03 OF 05  070943Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------6B4532  070944Z /38 </p><p>R 070945Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6542 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 05 HARARE 003680 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S - ARLENE RENDER AND TODD FAULK </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/ROBERT SHEPARD </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/RALYEA AND NATAN EPSTEIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03680  03 OF 05  070943Z </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID WASHDC FOR AFR/SA - NAN NEWMAN, OTI - MARC </p><p>SCOTT, AND A/AID - RICHARD MCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2001 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PINR, PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SUSPECTED CIO MOLE RENDERS ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF </p><p>TRADE UNIONS INEFFECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>CHITAURO, MINISTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE, LABOR, AND SOCIAL </p><p>WELFARE.

ZINDOGA DOES NOT </p><p>DISCLOSE THE DETAILS OF THESE DISCUSSIONS TO ANY OF HIS </p><p>ZCTU COLLEAGUES. "HE SPENDS MORE TIME WITH FLORENCE THAN </p><p>WITH ANY OF US," HUFFED MATONGO. "FOR INSTANCE, WE HAD </p><p>FINALLY MANAGED TO SCHEDULE A MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE IN LATE JUNE TO PLAN FOR THE ANNUAL CONGRESS. </p><p>ZINDOGA NEVER SHOWED, NEVER CALLED -- NOTHING. HIS </p><p>SECRETARY TOLD ME HOURS LATER THAT HE HAD GONE TO GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WITH CHITAURO FOR THE ILO CONVENTION.

(C) MEANWHILE, WORKSHOPS ON A VARIETY OF LABOR TOPICS </p><p>-- WHICH ARE AMONG THE ZCTU\'S CORE "BREAD AND BUTTER" </p><p>SERVICES TO ITS MEMBERS -- HAVE BEEN CANCELED OR DELAYED </p><p>BECAUSE OF ZINDOGA\'S REFUSAL TO AUTHORIZE FUNDING. THE </p><p>ZCTU\'S ADVOCACY DEPARTMENT, WHOSE ATTORNEYS ASSIST </p><p>INDIVIDUAL WORKERS WITH LEGAL DISPUTES, HAS BEEN </p><p>SIMILARLY INACTIVE PENDING A "BUDGET REVIEW." MATONGO </p><p>AND MAKORE ARGUE THAT LACK OF FINANCES IS A SPURIOUS </p><p>ARGUMENT ON ZINDOGA\'S PART; THE ZCTU\'S FY2000 BUDGET WAS </p><p>APPROVED AT ITS ANNUAL CONGRESS IN SEPTEMBER 1999. </p><p>MEMBERSHIP DUES HAVE NOT DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE </p><p>THAT TIME, AND THE ZCTU\'S SIX DEPARTMENTS WERE ALLOCATED </p><p>ROUGHLY THE SAME RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED IN </p><p>PREVIOUS YEARS.

(C) EVEN MORE FRUSTRATING, SAID MATONGO, HAS BEEN </p><p>ZINDOGA\'S BLOCKAGE OF FUNDS FROM THE SOLIDARITY CENTER </p><p>IN HARARE, A BRANCH OF THE AFL-CIO\'S AMERICAN CENTER FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LABOR SOLIDARITY. FORMER SOLIDARITY CENTER </p><p>RESREP MARTIN DOUGHERTY TOLD LABOFF BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE </p><p>IN JUNE THAT, DESPITE HISTORICALLY EXCELLENT RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE ZCTU, ZINDOGA HAS SHUNNED THE AMERICAN NGO, </p><p>WHICH FUNDS IT HAS USED PRIMARILY TO HELP THE ZCTU </p><p>CONDUCT LABOR WORKSHOPS AND GRASSROOTS CAPACITY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03680  03 OF 05  070943Z </p><p>BUILDING.

(C) SEVERAL UNION CONTACTS TOLD US THAT ONE OF THE </p><p>MOST TROUBLING FACETS OF THE ZCTU\'S INACTIVITY WAS </p><p>ZINDOGA\'S REFUSAL TO ALLOW THE ORGANIZATION TO ISSUE ANY </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS CONDEMNING PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE OR </p><p>ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO VOTE IN THE JUST HELD </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.

(NOTE: </p><p>EVERYONE, INCLUDING MATONGO AND ZINDOGA, EXPECTS THE TWO </p><p>MDC LEADERS TO FORMALLY RESIGN FROM THE ZCTU IN THE </p><p>COMING WEEKS. MATONGO IS PUSHING HARD TO HOLD THE ZCTU\'S </p><p>ANNUAL CONGRESS AS USUAL IN SEPTEMBER. HE AND MAKORE ARE </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT ZINDOGA AND CHIFAMBA WILL BE VOTED OUT OF </p><p>OFFICE BY THE LARGELY MDC MEMBERSHIP OF THE LABOR </p><p>UNIONS. MATONGO NOTED THAT SEVERAL YOUNG, ENERGETIC, AND </p><p>POPULAR CANDIDATES FROM THE RAILWAY WORKERS\' AND BANK </p><p>WORKERS\' UNIONS ARE EAGER TO SECURE SEATS ON THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, OPINING THAT THEY WILL HAVE NO </p><p>TROUBLE OUSTING THE ZANU-PF CAMP. ZINDOGA, MEANWHILE, </p><p>TOLD LABOFF THAT PLANS FOR THE ANNUAL CONGRESS WERE </p><p>"PROCEEDING," BUT AGAIN THE LACK OF FUNDS WAS PREVENTING </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF THE EVENT IN A TIMELY FASHION. ZINDOGA </p><p>WOULD NOT COMMENT ON HIS CHANCES OF BEING ELECTED </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL (NOT ADMINISTRATIVELY PROMOTED BECAUSE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OF TSVANGIRAI\'S DEPARTURE, AS WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CASE), </p><p>OR ON THE EXPECTED DATE OF THE CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) IT IS ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE AND INDEED LIKELY THAT, </p><p>AS THE ZCTU GREW IN STATURE AND ITS CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT BECAME INCREASINGLY STRIDENT IN 1998, </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE INSTRUCTED MINISTER CHITAURO (HERSELF A </p><p>FORMER TRADE UNIONIST) TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE </p><p>PROBLEM.

HE WAS PERFECTLY </p><p>POISED TO TAKE TSVANGIRAI\'S POSITION UPON HIS DEPARTURE </p><p>FOR THE MDC IN APRIL, AND THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE </p><p>THEORY THAT ZINDOGA HAS WORKED HARD TO MAKE SURE THE </p><p>ZCTU -- THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OPPOSITION </p><p>MOVEMENT IN ZIMBABWEAN HISTORY -- HAS BECOME TOOTHLESS </p><p>AND INERT. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) NONETHELESS, THE ZCTU\'S LOCAL, PROVINCIAL, AND </p><p>NATIONAL STRUCTURES HAVE BECOME FIRMLY ESTABLISHED </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY -- THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE </p><p>TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE AMERICAN </p><p>SOLIDARITY CENTER. WITH THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP, THE ZCTU </p><p>CERTAINLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RETURN TO ITS GLORY DAYS. </p><p>AS INFLATION, THE COST OF LIVING, AND UNEMPLOYMENT </p><p>CONTINUE TO SPIRAL UPWARD -- WITH THE GOVERNMENT MAKING </p><p>NO STEPS TOWARD RECOVERY -- WORKERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A </p><p>REVITALIZED LABOR MOVEMENT NOW MORE THAN EVER. WE AGREE </p><p>WITH MATONGO\'S PREDICTION THAT ZINDOGA PROBABLY WILL BE </p><p>VOTED OUT OF OFFICE AT THE NEXT ZCTU CONGRESS, ALTHOUGH </p><p>WE EXPECT ZINDOGA\'S ATTEMPTS TO STALL THE EVENT TO BE </p><p>EFFECTIVE, PERHAPS EVEN INTO 2001.
