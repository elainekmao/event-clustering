REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01257  01 OF 03  060924Z </p><p>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE IMPENDING ARRIVAL OF A NEW ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE </p><p>FOR AFRICA PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE STOCK OF OUR </p><p>RELATIONSHIP ITH ZIMBABWE.  THAT RELATIONSHIP HAS DETERIORATED </p><p>BADLY AS THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASINGLY ELIED ON VIOLENCE </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION TO PRESERVE IS HOLD ON POWER AND HAS DRIVEN A </p><p>ONCE-PROMISING CONOMY INTO THE GROUND.   CAUGHT IN A PAN- </p><p>AFRICAIST TIME WARP, THE PRESENT LEADERSHIP SEEM CLUELES ABOUT </p><p>HOW THEY COME OFF TO US AND WHAT THEY MUS DO TO REVERSE ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE BELIEVE </p><p>THERE IS VALUE IN DEVELOPING A DIPLOMATIC "ROADMAP" WHICH SPELLS </p><p>OUT THE STEPS PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE IN </p><p>ORDER TO EXTRICATE THEMSELVES FROM THE CURRENT MESS AND IMPROVE </p><p>THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) TOWARD THAT END, WE HAVE ATTEMPTED IN THIS CABLE TO DISTILL </p><p>OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS IN ZIMBABWE INTO A </p><p>LIST OF SPECIFIC, ACHIEVABLE ACTIONS THE GOZ MUST TAKE IN THE SHORT </p><p>TERM IF IT WANTS TO IMPROVE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH US.  AS WE </p><p>ENVISION IT, THE ROADMAP COULD BE PRESENTED AS A NON-PAPER TO </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE, FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE, OR ANOTHER SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIAL, AND WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY GUIDE OUR DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT </p><p>WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE.  THE GOZ MAY BE DISMISSIVE OF SUCH </p><p>AN EFFORT ON OUR PART, BUT WE BELIEVE THERE IS VALUE NONETHELESS IN </p><p>MAKING ABSOLUTELY CLER THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS WE CONSIDER </p><p>PREREQUISITESTO AN IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP.  WE REALIZE THAT </p><p>PRESENTING THE GOZ WITH A MERE LIST OF DEMANDS IS PROBABLY NOT THE </p><p>MOST CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH.  THE ROADMAP SHOULD ALSO LAY OUT </p><p>PARTICULAR PRESSURES AND INCENTIVES THAT THE UNITED STATES IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01257  01 OF 03  060924Z </p><p>PREPARED TO UTILIZE IN OUR EFFORT TO ELICIT A POSITIVE CHANGE IN </p><p>POLICY AND BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WE HOPE THE TALKING POINTS RECOMMENDED BELOW MIGHT ALSO BE </p><p>HELPFUL TO A/S-DESIGNATE KANSTEINER IN HIS SENATE CONFIRMATION </p><p>HEARINGS, WHERE WE ASSUME HE WILL BE ASKED WHAT HE PLANS TO DO </p><p>ABOUT ZIMBABWE\'S RECALCITRANT LEADER.   END SUMMARY AND </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>SUGGESTED SUBSTANCE OF ROAD MAP </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WE PROVIDE BELOW RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE CATEGORIES (AND </p><p>SPECIFIC TALKING POINTS) WHICH MIGHT FORM THE SUBSTANCE OF A </p><p>ROADMAP, AS WELL AS SUGGESTIONS OF POSSIBLE STICKS AND CARROTS.  WE </p><p>WOULD WELCOME THE DEPARTMENT\'S FEEDBACK, BOTH ON THE ROADMAP </p><p>CONCEPT AND OUR SUGGESTED SUBSTANCE.  WE HAVE NOT ADDRESSED </p><p>TIMELINES OR THE QUESTION OF WHICH GOZ ACTIONS MIGHT ELICIT WHICH </p><p>REACTIONS FROM US, LEAVING SUCH REFINEMENT UP TO THE DEPARTMENT AND </p><p>THE INTERAGENCY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>RULE OF LAW </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>-- REIN IN THE WAR VETERANS AND ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>BEING ALLOWED TO TERRORIZE ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENS -- FARMERS, FARM </p><p>WORKERS, TEACHERS, JUDGES, JOURNALISTS, BUSINESS OWNERS, AND </p><p>ANYONE SUSPECTED OF SUPPORTING THE OPPOSITION.
