<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002907 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU, IQ </p><p>SUBJECT: FOREIGN EMBASSIES IN BAGHDAD: TURKS PLAN TO </p><p>RE-ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC MISSION SOON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 114629 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 2585 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 2627 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U)  Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Please see para 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On May 3, DCM delivered ref A talking points to MFA </p><p>DG for Middle East Affairs Tahsin Burcuoglu on the CENTCOM </p><p>agreement to allow countries to send small security teams to </p><p>guard diplomatic properties in Iraq.  DCM conveyed the point </p><p>that at this time CENTCOM would not permit other diplomatic </p><p>or technical personnel to enter Iraq.  Burcuoglu, noting that </p><p>several other countries had already sent in diplomatic </p><p>personnel and set up missions, said that Turkey plans to </p><p>enter Iraq on May 12, via Jordan, to re-establish its </p><p>diplomatic mission.  He said that Turkey\'s 4/30 National </p><p>Security Council (NSC) had made this recommendation. </p><p>Furthermore, Burcuoglu said that while Turkey would prefer to </p><p>enter Iraq through the Habur Gate, it is currently planning </p><p>to send its staff via Jordan.  Burcuoglu indicated that the </p><p>GOT would be using Iraqi-registered cars (registered before </p><p>the start of the war) to enter the country and that Ankara </p><p>would provide the USG with the names and passport numbers of </p><p>the personnel as well as license plates and travel plans </p><p>before crossing the border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Action request:  We note that ref C confirms </p><p>Burcuoglu\'s claim that a number of countries have returned </p><p>staff to Baghdad.  Since the GOT has already decided to </p><p>proceed, we second Amman\'s request for information on how the </p><p>process of border control and authorization (in the absence </p><p>of LNO\'s at CENTCOM) should proceed. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
