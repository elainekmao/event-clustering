REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In the ten months it has been mobilized against </p><p>Maoist insurgents, the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) has had to </p><p>change from a ceremonial, parade-ground army, occasionally </p><p>deployed in UN Peacekeeping Operations, to a combat-ready </p><p>fighting force, expected to counter and overcome an enemy who </p><p>uses guerrilla tactics and outright terrorism to advance its </p><p>aims.  Among the many tools RNA troops and their leadership </p><p>lacked when called into action were adequate human rights </p><p>training and mechanisms to investigate allegations of </p><p>violations.  The RNA leadership initially appeared reluctant </p><p>to address such allegations, but has since developed a unit </p><p>within the office of its Judge Advocate General to review </p><p>complaints.  The quality and adequacy of these investigations </p><p>are yet to be proven.  In the meantime, the Embassy is </p><p>providing training to help improve soldiers\' awareness of </p><p>human rights in the field and best practices in conducting </p><p>investigations of violations.  The Embassy believes remaining </p><p>engaged with the RNA through a sustained dialogue on human </p><p>rights is the best way to ensure that respect for human </p><p>rights in institutionalized during the Army\'s difficult </p><p>transition from a parade-ground army to a capable fighting </p><p>force.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>FROM THE PARADE GROUND TO THE TRENCHES </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) During the first five years of Nepal\'s six-year-old </p><p>Maoist insurgency, the Royal Nepal Army (RNA), under the </p><p>technical command of the country\'s constitutional monarch, </p><p>remained in its barracks, emerging only to take part in </p><p>ceremonial Palace functions or to participate in sought-after </p><p>UN Peacekeeping missions.  The brunt of the Maoists\' </p><p>anti-government wrath at that time was largely borne by the </p><p>civilian police, more than 500 of whom were killed by the </p><p>insurgents in the first five years of the conflict.  During </p><p>those years, individual police were guilty of a number of </p><p>human rights violations against rural populations in </p><p>conflict-affected areas, the most sensational being the </p><p>infamous Kilo Sera To operation in 1998, in which numerous </p><p>suspects were killed, tortured and arrested. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The RNA\'s role changed virtually overnight November </p><p>23 when Maoists, who had unilaterally broken a four-month </p><p>ceasefire just a day before, attacked an army barracks, </p><p>killing 11 soldiers and their commanding officer.  By </p><p>November 26, King Gyanendra, the RNA\'s Supreme Commander, had </p><p>declared a state of emergency which suspended nearly all </p><p>civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution and mobilized the </p><p>RNA against the insurgents.  Since then, more than 200 RNA </p><p>soldiers have died in the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Most Nepalis, weary of the insurgency, welcomed </p><p>the deployment of the RNA, which was widely perceived as more </p><p>professional, better disciplined, and better equipped than </p><p>the police.  The Army\'s close association with the </p><p>Palace--which had previously also remained largely aloof from </p><p>the conflict--helped foster that perception.  Sanguine </p><p>predictions from the beleaguered population that the Army </p><p>would finish off the insurgents within a few months were </p><p>common. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  But in many ways the RNA was, at the time, </p><p>particularly ill suited to counter a guerrilla insurgency. </p><p>Despite the ongoing conflict--and the obvious possibility </p><p>that the RNA might one day be mobilized--the military budget </p><p>had been slashed over successive years.  Their weapons, </p><p>uniforms, and boots may have looked nice on a parade ground </p><p>but proved unable to withstand battle conditions in difficult </p><p>terrain.  The RNA leadership, most of whom are members of the </p><p>elite Chhetri caste of the King, had spent most of their </p><p>relatively comfortable careers to date insulated from public </p><p>criticism of their performance.  Becoming suddenly </p><p>accountable to a civilian government and a public with </p><p>inflated expectations was not a comfortable transition. </p><p>Their officers--generally also from the higher castes--tended </p><p>to be aloof from lower-caste speaking ethnic minorities who </p><p>predominate in Maoist-affected areas, making it difficult for </p><p>them to gain popular support or to exploit local intelligence </p><p>assets. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>MAOISTS WAGE DIRTY WAR </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Since the RNA\'s deployment, the operational tempo </p><p>on both sides has increased dramatically.  Of the 5,353 </p><p>Nepalis who have been killed in the insurgency since it began </p><p>in February 1996, more than half (3,055) have died since the </p><p>beginning of 2002 alone.  The Maoists have recently stepped </p><p>up their campaign of terror against innocent civilians, most </p><p>likely in an effort to discourage participation in national </p><p>elections in November.  In the first two weeks of September, </p><p>the insurgents killed more civilians than they had in any </p><p>single month of 2002.  Nor have the Maoists relented in their </p><p>attacks against the security forces, killing more than 100 </p><p>policemen and soldiers in two separate, mass attacks </p><p>September 7 and 8. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The Maoists\' use of brutal tactics against their </p><p>targets, many of whom are civilian, is undeniable.  They have </p><p>murdered teachers, local political workers, and simple </p><p>farmers by decapitation, slashing them with knives, and </p><p>beating them to death, sometimes torturing their victims </p><p>before killing them. They have  dragooned countless unwilling </p><p>villagers into their ranks, using many, including children, </p><p>as human shields.  They bomb residential, commercial and </p><p>government edifices without prior warning, and have made a </p><p>practice of destroying rural infrastructure--bridges, roads, </p><p>micro-hydroelectric schemes, drinking water projects, schools </p><p>and health posts--leaving thousands without electricity, </p><p>water, or access to the outside world.  They launch human </p><p>wave attacks to overrun fixed positions, and have summarily </p><p>executed those who are wounded or surrender to them.  They </p><p>wreak revenge on police and soldiers by assassinating members </p><p>of their family. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY DIFFICULT UNDER STATE OF EMERGENCY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The high operational tempo; the lack of appropriate </p><p>equipment, adequate manpower, and sufficient training; the </p><p>pressures of having to negotiate remote, often inaccessible </p><p>terrain; the difficulty of distinguishing friend from foe in </p><p>a domestic insurgency; the ineffectiveness of civilian </p><p>government in conflict-affected areas; the brutality of </p><p>Maoist tactics--all of these factors undoubtedly complicate </p><p>the RNA\'s mission.  The state of emergency, which remained in </p><p>near-continuous operation from November 26-August 28, was </p><p>intended to help mitigate the difficult circumstances under </p><p>which the RNA found itself required to operate.  (Note:  Some </p><p>critics contend the RNA leadership made deployment </p><p>conditional upon the declaration of a state of emergency.  We </p><p>have no proof that the RNA made such a demand, but have heard </p><p>its leadership assert that the state of emergency makes their </p><p>job easier.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  The state of emergency, which was initially ratified </p><p>by the now-defunct Parliament in February, suspended all </p><p>constitutionally guaranteed civil rights except the right to </p><p>habeas corpus.  Most important, the emergency granted the </p><p>police, paramilitary Armed Police Force, and Army broad </p><p>powers to search without a warrant and to detain suspects </p><p>without charge for 90 days (with the possibility of another </p><p>90-day extension).  The ordinance did not explicitly require </p><p>the security forces to maintain a log of individuals taken </p><p>into custody, nor did it make provision for notification of </p><p>the families of detainees--let alone visits by family or </p><p>legal counsel.  (The ICRC is routinely told by the RNA that </p><p>the military does not have any detainees--even though Embassy </p><p>personnel have seen some detainees during visits to </p><p>barracks.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Restrictions on free press--both as a result of </p><p>self-censorship and the suspension of the right to </p><p>information--also cloud the situation.  The press corps, </p><p>often legitimately afraid of venturing into conflict-affected </p><p>areas, generally rely upon verbatim Ministry of Defense press </p><p>releases for information.  The bulk of these press releases </p><p>offer a one-line report of the killing of one or two Maoists </p><p>without further clarification of the nature of the </p><p>engagement, the identity of the Maoists, or whether any </p><p>security forces were killed or injured.  (The exceptions, of </p><p>course, are accounts of major engagements, where press </p><p>coverage is more extensive.)  The overwhelming majority of </p><p>those killed in the conflict this year--75 percent--are those </p><p>described as Maoists in Ministry of Defense press releases. </p><p>(Note:  Official accounts of Maoist dead in large engagements </p><p>are generally unreliable.  Wherever conflicting numbers have </p><p>been offered, we have consistently recorded the more </p><p>conservative estimate.  According to the Government\'s </p><p>official tally, the Maoist death toll is much higher.  End </p><p>note.)  At a May 28 battle at Khara, Rukum, the RNA </p><p>officially claimed 300 Maoists were killed--but none wounded </p><p>or taken prisoner.  The Ministry of Defense has reported at </p><p>least 260 separate incidents since January in which a single </p><p>Maoist was killed by security forces with no further </p><p>reporting on other Maoists injured or taken prisoner in the </p><p>incident, or the nature of the engagement.  It thus remains </p><p>unclear exactuly under what circumstances these 260 </p><p>individuals died.  However, when poloff asked RNA officers </p><p>why so many individual Maoists were getting killed with no </p><p>corresponding reporting of a battle or engagement, the </p><p>officers explained that most were "shot while trying to </p><p>escape." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  The RNA\'s overarching suspicion of most human </p><p>rights organizations as overly sympathetic to the Maoists </p><p>limits the Army\'s interaction with these groups.  Many of </p><p>these organizations are equally suspicious of the RNA.  One </p><p>NGO that treats victims of torture regardless of political </p><p>affiliation has had to cease operations in some areas, its </p><p>director says, because of Army pressure.  The National Human </p><p>Rights Commission, the ostensibly autonomous constitutional </p><p>body with responsibility for investigating violations, is </p><p>highly politicized and largely dysfunctional.  (As noted Ref </p><p>D, we believe the National Human Rights Commission is deeply </p><p>flawed.)  With the expiration of the terms of local </p><p>government officials in July, one last source of independent </p><p>information in some of these remote areas has dried up.  The </p><p>combination of these factors--limited press coverage, a weak </p><p>civil society, and the absence now of any independently </p><p>elected political leadership at either the national or local </p><p>levels--has left Nepal with an inadequate system of checks </p><p>and balances to the near-unlimited right of security forces </p><p>to detain and question.  Under such conditions--where all we </p><p>may ever have is a one-source allegation of an abuse--it is </p><p>especially difficult to determine the credibility of either </p><p>version. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>RNA HUMAN RIGHTS CELL </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)   In July the RNA announced the formation of a human </p><p>rights cell under the direction of the Judge Advocate General </p><p>(Ref A) to review the results of investigations into alleged </p><p>violations.  According to JAG Brig. Gen. B.A. Sharma, who </p><p>heads the cell, the unit has received no complaints thus far </p><p>of extra-judicial killings.  Instead, most inquiries focus on </p><p>determining the whereabouts of suspects believed to be in RNA </p><p>custody.  Since the RNA maintains no central log of detainees </p><p>and because suspects often refuse to reveal their true names, </p><p>Sharma said, it is difficult to determine whether the missing </p><p>people are indeed in RNA custody.  Sometimes detainees do not </p><p>want it known they are in RNA custody for fear of Maoist </p><p>retaliation against their family, he suggested.  Sometimes </p><p>the RNA has to keep prisoners at its barracks because local </p><p>jails are full.  The RNA still has to fix the procedures for </p><p>determining the whereabouts of detainees; as of now his unit </p><p>simply asks the local commander if the person in question is </p><p>in his custody.  The Army is now starting to notify the Chief </p><p>District Officer (the senior civil servant in the district) </p><p>of the names of individuals in its custody.  Sharma said he </p><p>has advised commanders to notify the families of detainees of </p><p>their whereabouts and their welfare. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  Poloff asked about any other pending </p><p>investigations, including the promised inquiry into the death </p><p>in custody of Kancha Dongol March 15 (Ref C).  That </p><p>investigation is underway; its likely outcome, according to </p><p>the major spearheading the inquiry, is a finding that Dongol </p><p>(who sustained six gun shots and whose body showed evidence </p><p>of torture) made a grab for one of his captors\' guns.  An </p><p>investigation into the November 30 killings of five villagers </p><p>in Rolpa, who were shot from an RNA helicopter, had revealed </p><p>that the aircraft had been fired on first.  Poloff asked </p><p>about the May 1 shootings of six men in Sindhupalchowk (Ref </p><p>B), noting recent coverage of the event in a London </p><p>newspaper.  Sharma replied that an inquiry had revealed that </p><p>the six men had fired on RNA soldiers--a version that differs </p><p>significantly from that offered Ref B by both the CDO and the </p><p>local police commander.  Poloff asked about the June 29 </p><p>killings by the RNA of four suspected Maoists in Ramite </p><p>Khola, Morang.  According to a report from a local NGO, the </p><p>four men were kept handcuffed on display in the public market </p><p>for part of the day and then taken near a school where they </p><p>were shot.  Sharma said he was unaware of the incident and </p><p>would look into it. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>SIGNS OF PROGRESS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) The RNA leadership has on numerous occasions assured </p><p>us of its willingness to respect international human rights </p><p>standards and has agreed to accept training for its troops </p><p>and officers on the topic.  Although all soldiers are </p><p>educated on Rules of Engagement and are aware that they </p><p>should not torture or kill suspects, the exigencies of the </p><p>situation necessitated deployment without adequate training </p><p>on human rights during conflict, the officers have explained. </p><p> The RNA\'s top leadership is well aware of the negative </p><p>effect human rights violations would have on our expanding </p><p>military-to-military relationship and related security </p><p>assistance--as well as on ther own forces\' good order and </p><p>discipline.  Nonetheless, they clearly view the dirty-war </p><p>tactics of their Maoist adversaries as a mitigating factor, </p><p>making compliance with human rights standards difficult. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  Despite this attitude, we are seeing some </p><p>significant progress. The reactivation of a Joint Combined </p><p>Exercise and Training (JCET) program after a five-year hiatus </p><p>has intensified our human rights dialogue with the RNA.  We </p><p>(and the British) pressed the RNA to develop the independent </p><p>human rights cell so formed in July.  (Previously all </p><p>complaints were investigated by the commander of the suspect </p><p>unit himself.)  While the quality and breadth of the </p><p>investigations undertaken by this unit remain to be seen, the </p><p>RNA\'s willingness to accept training in this area is a </p><p>reassuring sign.  The UK government is examining the </p><p>possibility of detailing a British army officer to the unit </p><p>to assist it in its early stages.  In addition, 14 RNA </p><p>officers, at the rank of Colonel and above, attended a </p><p>September 25-26 workshop on the Law of Armed Conflict, with </p><p>training jointly offered by representatives of the ICRC and </p><p>the USG\'s Defense Institute of International Legal Studies. </p><p>16.  (C)  Without other independent organs like the media and </p><p>human rights groups operating in conflict-ridden areas, it is </p><p>difficult either to corroborate or refute the RNA\'s version </p><p>of events, or to gather "credible evidence" of violations </p><p>that amounts to much more than allegations.  The absence of </p><p>checks and balances during the state of emergency, which </p><p>expired August 28, allowed the RNA to operate with a certain </p><p>degree of impunity.  That said, the RNA is now developing, </p><p>like so much else in its repertoire, rules to implement the </p><p>human rights standards it knows it must inculcate in its </p><p>soldiers. Progress, especially initially, has been rocky but </p><p>is showing some improvement.  To the extent possible, it is </p><p>important to remain engaged with the RNA, via our ongoing </p><p>dialogue on human rights, as it begins this important </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
