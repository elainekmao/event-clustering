<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002253 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/01/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, PHUM, SOCI, EAID, PINR, NI, ZI, UK </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA TURNS ZIMBABWE AROUND ON LAND SEIZURES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2178 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMCONSUL LAGOS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958:  DECL: 09/01/2011 </p><p>TAGS: </p><p>SUBJECT:  Nigeria Turns Zimbabwe Around on Land Seizures </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews.  Reason:  1.5(b) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  President Obasanjo and Nigeria played the </p><p>critical role in extracting GOZ commitment to stopping land </p><p>seizures at the Abuja Ministerial on Zimbabwe September 6. </p><p>The UK agreed to a "significant financial contribution" to </p><p>land reform but views that commitment as contingent upon the </p><p>GOZ keeping its promises.  For Nigeria, the Ministerial </p><p>provided a platform from which to demonstrate its prowess at </p><p>international statesmanship.  HMG will provide further </p><p>details in London and Washington.  The full text of the </p><p>communique has been faxed to AF/W.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Commonwealth Ministerial Committee on Zimbabwe </p><p>(Nigeria, Canada, Jamaica, Kenya, South Africa, the United </p><p>Kingdom and Zimbabwe) met in Abuja September 6.  It agreed </p><p>that "land is at the core of the crisis in Zimbabwe and </p><p>cannot be separated from other issues of concern to the </p><p>Commonwealth, such as the rule of law, respect for human </p><p>rights, democracy and the economy."  The joint communique, </p><p>agreed among heads of delegation over a very long lunch, </p><p>called for a "program of land reform...implemented in a fair, </p><p>just and sustainable manner, in the interest of all the </p><p>people of Zimbabwe, within the law and constitution of </p><p>Zimbabwe."  The meeting welcomed the "re-affirmation of the </p><p>United Kingdom\'s commitment to a significant financial </p><p>contribution to such a land reform program and its </p><p>under-taking to encourage other international donors to do </p><p>the same." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Assurances were given by the GOZ that there would "be </p><p>no further occupation of farm lands;" that it was committed </p><p>"to the Harare Commonwealth Declaration and the Millbrook </p><p>Commonwealth Action Programme;" that it would "speed up the </p><p>process by which farms that do not meet set criteria are </p><p>de-listed;" and that "for farms that are not designated, </p><p>occupiers would be moved to legally acquired lands."  The GOZ </p><p>also agreed to accelerate "discussions with the UNDP, with a </p><p>view to reaching agreement as quickly as possible,...to </p><p>restore the rule of law to the process of land reform </p><p>programme (sic);...to freedom of expression as guaranteed by </p><p>the Constitution of Zimbabwe and to take firm action against </p><p>violence and intimidation." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The meeting agreed, "that the way forward is for </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s international partners: </p><p>(a) to engage constructively with the UNDP and the Government </p><p>of Zimbabwe in pursuing an effective and sustainable land </p><p>reform programme, on the basis of the UNDP proposals of </p><p>December 2000; </p><p>(b) to respond positively to any request from the Government </p><p>of Zimbabwe in support of the electoral process; and </p><p>(c) to continue to contribute to poverty reduction programmes </p><p>for the benefit of the people of Zimbabwe and that those </p><p>partners present (Australia, Canada and United Kingdom), </p><p>would actively pursue these objectives." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Separately, Ambassador Raphael Uwechue, Special </p><p>Presidential Envoy for Conflict Resolution in Africa, told </p><p>Charge and Polmiloff September 7 that Nigeria did not define </p><p>being African by skin color.  It was critical to avoid </p><p>further conflict on the continent, particularly conflict with </p><p>a racial tinge. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) According to British High Commission officials here, </p><p>this was the line President Olusegun Obasanjo took at a </p><p>September 6 breakfast opening the Ministerial gathering. </p><p>Nigeria\'s President also stressed the need for equitable and </p><p>fair land reform.  HMG regretted that Zimbabwean FM Mudenge </p><p>had not been present to hear Obasanjo\'s remarks but noted </p><p>that Foreign Minister Sule Lamido echoed Obasanjo faithfully </p><p>during the rest of the day.  Consensus was achieved on most </p><p>points at issue.  However, Mudenge would not agree to </p><p>international election observers; the best that could be </p><p>obtained was the passage in para 4(b), above. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) According to officials here, HMG is not convinced </p><p>that Mugabe will carry through on the commitments Mudenge </p><p>made at Abuja.  There is residual unease that the GOZ came to </p><p>Abuja in order to "avoid a division within the Common-wealth, </p><p>especially at the forthcoming CHOGM in Brisbane" (joint </p><p>communique, para 2(d)) and that intimidation and land </p><p>seizures could resume shortly thereafter (assuming they </p><p>indeed cease). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The British could not have been more pleased with the </p><p>way Obasanjo handled the event.  He brought the GOZ to Abuja </p><p>and, our British colleagues surmise, worked the phone with </p><p>Mugabe throughout, to produce a successful ending. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Comment:  For Nigeria, the positive conclusion to the </p><p>Ministerial on Zimbabwe demonstrates the prowess of its </p><p>statesmanship and the fruit of many years of engagement in </p><p>southern Africa.  While the Nigerians do not want to give up </p><p>on Mugabe (stressing repeatedly during the meeting that the </p><p>international community has to treat him with "dignity" in </p><p>order to obtain cooperation), neither can Mugabe easily </p><p>forget Nigeria\'s firm support for liberation.  The results </p><p>also demonstrate once again that Obasanjo is a force of his </p><p>own in foreign policy and on the international stage.  Just a </p><p>week ago, his Foreign Ministry was still espousing a position </p><p>that demanded far less of Mugabe than what the Commonwealth </p><p>Ministers extracted (reftel).  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Mission has faxed the full text of the communique to </p><p>the Department (AF/W).  Our British interlocutors advise that </p><p>a thoroughgoing briefing on HMG views, including the thoughts </p><p>of principals who attended the meeting, can be obtained in </p><p>London after the return of the UK delegation Friday </p><p>afternoon, September 7. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
