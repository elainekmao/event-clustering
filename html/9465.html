<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001256 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CE, PGOV, PREL, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW PROPOSAL GOES TO LTTE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHARGE DON CAMP; REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:   On July 17, the Norwegians conveyed to </p><p>the LTTE the new GSL proposal to try to lure the LTTE back to </p><p>the negotiating table.   We may not know for several weeks </p><p>whether it will be successful, but the 19-month old ceasefire </p><p>does not seem at risk.   President Kumaratunga,s own </p><p>political plans are the biggest uncertainty and a potential </p><p>threat to the process.   Cohabitation strains between the </p><p>President and PM are as serious as ever.  If the President is </p><p>successful in her efforts either to align with the Sinhalese </p><p>chauvinist JVP party or to attract dissidents from the ruling </p><p>party, she could attempt to topple the current government. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  In a meeting with Charge, G.L. Peiris, a key </p><p>minister involved in peace process issues, confirmed that </p><p>Norwegian special envoy Jon Westborg carried to the LTTE </p><p>&capital8 of Kilinochchi July 17 the GSL proposal for a </p><p>provisional administrative structure for the north and east </p><p>of Sri Lanka.    He is to report back to Peiris tonight (July </p><p>17), but the LTTE is not expected to respond substantively </p><p>until it has had a chance to study the proposal and pass it </p><p>through their represenatives outside Sri Lanka, including </p><p>Balasingham.   Though the GSL is keeping the details to </p><p>itself, the PM in a July 16 meeting and .Peiris have shared </p><p>with us some of the details.    LTTE representatives would </p><p>have a majority on the &apex body8 of the structure.   The </p><p>government would also be represented (including </p><p>representatives from the President,s party, according to the </p><p>PM) as would the Muslem community.   Peiris stressed that </p><p>this proposal was the basic minimum the LTTE could accept as </p><p>well as being (barely) acceptable to representatives of the </p><p>east,s Moslems.  Peiris also said that the proposal </p><p>incorporated another principle (borrowed from proposals made </p><p>in Quebec and northern Ireland disputes) requiring  that any </p><p>issue affecting the &vital interests8 of a minority </p><p>community (Sinhalese or Muslim) would also require a majority </p><p>vote of that community,s representatives in the apex body. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The President,s political plans continue to roil the </p><p>waters in Colombo, and have potentially serious consequences </p><p>for the peace process.    The long-discussed alliance with </p><p>the far-left and anti-peace process JVP is perhaps the most </p><p>problematic, since the JVP reportedly would want ) at a </p><p>minimum ) to renegotiate the MOU with the LTTE that </p><p>initiated the peace process.    There is increasing backlash </p><p>against the proposed tieup, however, and the papers recently </p><p>claimed the President,s non-political children were </p><p>questioning how the party could countenance an alliance with </p><p>the killers of their father.   (Note:  Vijaya Kumaratunga was </p><p>gunned down in 1988.  The JVP is accused of perpetrating the </p><p>killing, but it has never been proven.)   There are also </p><p>rumors that the President is trying to lure away members of </p><p>the UNP government.  We have not confirmed these reports, or </p><p>their success. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The President must in any case be convinced she can </p><p>improve her position in parliament with either alliance. </p><p>The politicians and the astrologers are both reportedly </p><p>telling her that the coming months are the best time for a </p><p>move to topple the UNP government or perhaps call fresh </p><p>elections; she would like to have a government in place </p><p>before the provincial council elections next April. </p><p>Elections would disrupt the process and a PA-led government </p><p>would threaten the existing talks; LTTE political leader S.P. </p><p>Thamilchelvam has said they will not negotiate with </p><p>Kumaratunga. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  The good news is the general assumption in </p><p>Colombo and the north that the ceasefire is not currently </p><p>threatened.   The LTTE is relatively content with the status </p><p>quo, in which it controls much of the northern Vanni and </p><p>parts of the east, while exercising considerable influence in </p><p>the government-controlled Jaffna peninsula.   The LTTE </p><p>collects substantial revenue from customs duties in its </p><p>region as well as taxation of businesses and Tamils </p><p>individuals in the Vanni and Jaffna.  Independent estimates </p><p>in Colombo put the revenue as high as 30 million US dollars </p><p>per year.  The government too desperately wants to retain the </p><p>ceasefires the twentieth anniversary approaches (July 23) of </p><p>the 1983 riots that set off the insurgency,  the ceasefire is </p><p>seen as the major achievement of this government.    The </p><p>peace too has given the government some breathing space for </p><p>the economic reform and investment programs it has initiated. </p><p>  There is hope in Colombo, but always tinged with memories </p><p>of dashed hopes of previous years.  END COMMENT. </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
