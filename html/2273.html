<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 005605 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/CT: FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO: 2001 ANNUAL </p><p>TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 198912 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE GDRC PLAYED A POSITIVE, IF VERY MINOR, ROLE </p><p>ON TERRORISM ISSUES DURING 2001.  NONETHELESS, EASTERN DRC IS </p><p>UNDER CONTROL OF REBEL FORCES AND CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED BY </p><p>SEVERE DISORDER AND BANDITRY IN LARGE AREAS.  WHETHER ANY OF </p><p>THIS ACTIVITY CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS TERRORISM IS QUESTIONABLE, </p><p>BUT THE DISRUPTION IT CAUSES IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IS </p><p>NOT.  THE GOVERNMENT OF JOSEPH KABILA HAS RESPONDED </p><p>POSITIVELY ON MATTERS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM SINCE THE </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  POST\'S DETAILED RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p>A)  SUPPORT FOR THE GLOBAL COALITION </p><p> </p><p>SUBSEQUENT TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11 THE GDRC </p><p>HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF US REPRESENTATION ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM ISSUES.  THAT SAID THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>REPUBLIC OF CONGO REMAINS A DIVIDED COUNTRY WITH REBEL GROUPS </p><p>IN CONTROL OF ABOUT HALF ON THE COUNTRY.  IN REBEL-CONTROLLED </p><p>TERRITORY THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DISORDER, AND UNCONTROLLED </p><p>ARMED GROUPS ROAM FREELY.  BANDITRY AND DISORDER ARE </p><p>COMMONPLACE.  THIS ACTIVITY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ORGANIZED </p><p>TERRORISM, ALTHOUGH SOME UNCONTROLLED ARMED GROUPS HAVE THE </p><p>GOAL OF DESTABILIZING NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>B) TERRORIST INCIDENTS THWARTED, AND TERRORIST CELLS BROKEN </p><p>UP, DURING 2001. </p><p> </p><p>NONE </p><p> </p><p>C) RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM </p><p>DURING 2001 </p><p> </p><p>THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE DRC REMAINS IN A STATE OF </p><p>DYSFUNCTION.  SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL CASES ARE TRIED IN </p><p>MILITARY COURTS, IN WHICH DUE PROCESS STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW. </p><p> NO TERRORISM CASES WERE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN TRIED IN 2001. </p><p> </p><p>D) EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS </p><p> </p><p>NO EXTRADITION REQUESTS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DRC WERE </p><p>MADE DURING 2001. </p><p> </p><p>E) SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION </p><p>AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND DRC, BUT </p><p>THERE ARE NO IMPEDIMENTS TO DOMESTIC PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS IN THE DRC. </p><p> </p><p>F) HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT KABILA WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO OFFER HIS AND HIS </p><p>COUNTRY\'S CONDOLENCES FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO </p><p>MADE PUBLIC STATEMENTS AGAINST TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>G) MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 2001 </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF DRC MAINTAINS AN EXTENSIVE INTELLIGENCE </p><p>SERVICE, WHICH, INTER ALIA, CONDUCTS COUNTER-TERRORISM </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  NO SPECIFIC COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS, I.E., </p><p>THOSE OUTSIDE THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, ARE KNOWN TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN MADE DURING 2001 </p><p> </p><p>H) SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>NONE </p><p> </p><p>I) PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING </p><p>COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE </p><p> </p><p>NONE </p><p> </p><p>J) SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 2001 IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>SINCE JOSEPH KABILA TOOK POWER AFTER HIS FATHER\'S </p><p>ASSASSINATION, THE GOVERNMENT OF DRC HAS BEHAVED IN A MUCH </p><p>MORE RESPONSIBLE MANNER.  RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA, LIBYA </p><p>AND CUBA, FOR INSTANCE, REMAIN FRIENDLY, BUT THE FREQUENCY OF </p><p>VISITS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO THOSE COUNTRIES HAS </p><p>DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY.  MOST PROBABLY, THE PRINCIPAL REASON </p><p>FOR THE CHANGE IS THE FACT THAT JOSEPH KABILA HAS A BROADER </p><p>WORLD-VIEW THAN HIS FATHER, WHO RECEIVED HIS POLITICAL </p><p>EDUCATION DURING THE 60S. </p><p> </p><p>K) U.S. COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH THE </p><p>DRC GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>NO INSTANCES OF COOPERATION ON TERRORISM BETWEEN THE U.S. AND </p><p>DRC WERE RECORDED DURING 2001.  THE DRC MILITARY INTELLIGENCE </p><p>SERVICE HAS RESPONDED FAVORABLY TO A USDAO REQUEST FOR </p><p>COLLABORATION AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO </p><p>PROFESS ITS READINESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. ON TERRORISM </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>L) COOPERATION FROM THE DRC GOVERNMENT DURING THE PREVIOUS </p><p>FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF AN ACT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>NONE </p><p> </p><p>   (I) EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 2001 COOPERATED </p><p>OR IS COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>APPREHENDING, CONVICTING, AND PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR </p><p>INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACT; </p><p> </p><p>NONE </p><p> </p><p>   (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 2001 </p><p>COOPERATED OR IS COOPERATING IN PREVENTING FURTHER ACTS OF </p><p>TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN THE HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DRC HAS RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO U.S. </p><p>DEMARCHES ON ADHERENCE TO ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH TO DATE RATIFICATIONS OF THOSE ANTI-TERRORISM </p><p>CONVENTIONS TO WHICH THE DRC IS NOT A PARTY HAVE NOT BEEN </p><p>COMPLETED. </p><p> </p><p>M) EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 2001 COOPERATED </p><p>WITH OTHER ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. SOUGHT AND OBTAINED CLOSURE OF A STREET IN FRONT OF </p><p>THE EMBASSY.  THE CLOSURE IS PERMANENT AND A BARRIER WILL BE </p><p>CONSTRUCTED TO ENSURE THAT IT REMAINS SO.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ALSO GRANTED PERMISSION FOR THE EMBASSY SURVEILLANCE </p><p>DETECTION UNIT TO OPERATE IN PLAIN CLOTHES, WHICH GREATLY </p><p>INCREASES THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p></p></div>
