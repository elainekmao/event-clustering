<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002428 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, NI, NG </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA ASSURES NIGER ON MUTINEERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (U)  Responding to a request from the Niger Republic, </p><p>Nigerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sule Lamido promised </p><p>that Nigeria would apprehend the approximately 100 Nigerien </p><p>mutineers and return them to Niamey.  Lamido, however, </p><p>lamented the difficulty of identifying Nigerien soldiers </p><p>among the residents of the border region.  "If they remove </p><p>their uniforms, it is easy to melt into the crowd," he </p><p>commented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  According to press reports, Yobe State has </p><p>mobilized extra patrols on its border with Niger at Nguru, </p><p>Karasuwa and Geidam, the areas of the state nearest the </p><p>recent Nigerien revolt at Diffa.  Some Embassy contacts </p><p>speculate that the mutineers might try to cross the border </p><p>in the tri-state region near Lake Chad in Borno state </p><p>rather than near Yobe.  One commented, "The (Lake Chad) </p><p>region has been the home to many dissident factions from </p><p>Chad over the years and Nigerian control of its territory </p><p>in that area remains weak." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COMMENT:  The Nigerian police and military face </p><p>many pressing tasks and the GON has no wish to harbor the </p><p>rebels.   However, barring a chance encounter along the </p><p>remote border between the two countries, Nigeria\'s security </p><p>forces are unlikely to launch a sustained operation to </p><p>identify and apprehend the Nigeriens.  Moreover, in a brief </p><p>encounter with Ambassador Jeter, the Nigerien DATT said </p><p>that Niamey now thinks that most of the rebels fled to Chad </p><p>and not Nigeria. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
