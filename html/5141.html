<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BOGOTA 000342 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: FARC KIDNAPS CIVILIANS FOR CAR BOMB ATTACKS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON, REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) IN ITS LATEST WAVE OF CAR BOMB ATTACKS IN ARAUCA, THE </p><p>FARC REPORTEDLY HAS BEEN KIDNAPPING CIVILIANS AND USING THEM </p><p>AS UNWITTING SUICIDE DRIVERS OF CARS LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES. </p><p>ONCE THE CARS REACH THEIR TARGET, THE EXPLOSIVES ARE </p><p>DETONATED VIA REMOTE CONTROL.  SINCE JANUARY 8, THERE HAVE </p><p>BEEN THREE SUCH ATTACKS BY THE FARC IN ARAUCA DEPARTMENT.  IN </p><p>TWO OF THESE ATTACKS, THE FARC KIDNAPPED THREE BROTHERS AND </p><p>FORCED TWO OF THEM TO DRIVE THE CARS.  THE BROTHERS WERE TOLD </p><p>THEY WOULD BE SET FREE IF THEY WOULD DRIVE A CAR ON AN ERRAND </p><p>FOR THE FARC.  IN ONE OF THE INCIDENTS, ONE OF THE BROTHERS </p><p>SURVIVED THE EXPLOSION TO TELL THE AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE </p><p>FARC\'S NEW TACTIC.  PARTS OF ARAUCA CONSTITUTE ONE OF THE </p><p>GOC\'S TWO REHABILITATION ZONES AND THE DEPARTMENT IS THE </p><p>CENTER OF COLOMBIA\'S OIL PRODUCTION.  THE BOMBINGS HAVE TAKEN </p><p>PLACE IN THE VILLAGES OF ARAUQUITA, TAME, AND NEAR FORTUL. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) MINISTER OF DEFENSE MARTHA LUCIA RAMIREZ ANNOUNCED ON </p><p>JANUARY 14 THAT THE GOC WOULD DENOUNCE THE FARC\'S USE OF </p><p>HOSTAGES IN THE CAR BOMB ATTACKS BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS IN </p><p>GENEVA.  THE DECISION TO BRING THESE CASES TO THE UN WAS </p><p>TAKEN AFTER A SPECIAL SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING ON JANUARY 13 </p><p>BETWEEN PRESIDENT URIBE AND MILITARY OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: DETONATING CAR BOMBS AND KIDNAPPING CIVILIANS </p><p>ARE NOTHING NEW FOR THE FARC.  IT HAS USED CAR BOMBS FOR </p><p>ATTACKS IN ARAUCA, BOGOTA AND ELSEWHERE IN COLOMBIA AND HAS </p><p>KIDNAPPED HUNDREDS OF CIVILIANS FOR RANSOM AND TO PRESSURE </p><p>THE GOC TO RELEASE FARC MEMBERS IN JAIL.  THE THREE MOST </p><p>RECENT ARAUCA CAR BOMBINGS REPRESENT THE FIRST TIME THAT THE </p><p>FARC HAS USED, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, UNSUSPECTING KIDNAP VICTIMS </p><p>TO BE AGENTS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS.  LAST YEAR, THE FARC </p><p>MURDERED A CIVILIAN AND LEFT HIM IN HIS BOOBY-TRAPPED CAR </p><p>WHICH DETONATED WHEN THE AUTHORITIES ARRIVED.  WITH THE WIDE </p><p>MEDIA COVERAGE OF THESE ATTACKS, THIS NEW TACTIC WILL HAVE </p><p>LIMITED UTILITY, SINCE KIDNAP VICTIMS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE AS </p><p>COOPERATIVE AS DRIVERS IF THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE FACING </p><p>NEAR-CERTAIN DEATH.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
