<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002987 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: JO, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: FOLLOWING VISIT BY PAKISTANI ENVOY, JORDAN </p><p>FORWAWRDS PAKISTANI REQUEST FOR USG INVOLVEMENT IN KASHMIR </p><p>DISPUTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM. REASONS: 1.5.(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY.  On June 4, veteran Pakistani diplomat Wasim </p><p>Sajjad visited King Abdullah to discuss the Kashmir crisis </p><p>and requested that the King use his "good office" to convey </p><p>to governments around the world the need for India to "come </p><p>back to the negotiating table".  Following this meeting, GOJ </p><p>Royal Court Chief Fayez Tarawneh contacted the Ambassador to </p><p>ask officially, at the request of the Pakistani government </p><p>(GOP), that the USG do what it can in this regard.  While the </p><p>Jordanians feel obligated to convey this message, they do not </p><p>want to become an intermediary between the USG and India </p><p>and/or Pakistan, and do not expect a direct response from the </p><p>USG with regard to this matter.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>PAKISTANI ENVOY MEETS WITH KING </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Veteran Pakistani diplomat Wasim Sajaad met June 4 </p><p>with King Abdullah with regard to the current military </p><p>standoff in Kashmir.  In addition to his meeting with the </p><p>King, Sajaad had previously met with President Assad in Syria </p><p>and will subsequently travel to Lebanon and Turkey.  Sajaad </p><p>is attempting to convince leaders in the region that the GOP </p><p>is doing all that it can to prevent a war with India, and </p><p>that an international effort is required to force Pakistan </p><p>and India to come back to the negotiating table.  With regard </p><p>to the international community at large, Sajaad requested </p><p>that the King use his "good office" to convince the USG and </p><p>others to coax India "back to the negotiating table".  Sajaad </p><p>reported to the Jordan Times that his meetings with Assad and </p><p>King Abdullah were "fruitful" and reiterated the GOP\'s desire </p><p>to prevent "a conflict". </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>GOJ HEEDS PAKISTAN\'S REQUEST TO REQUEST </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On June 5, Royal Court Chief Fayez Tarawneh  contacted </p><p>the Ambassador to convey the GOP request formally.  According </p><p>to Tawarneh, the Pakistani envoy said that the GOP wants to </p><p>avoid war, and will "do anything" to convince the USG and the </p><p>world of its sincerity in this regard.  However, the GOP is </p><p>concerned that the USG and others misunderstand the GOP </p><p>posture towards the Kashmir crisis.  Sajaad reportedly said </p><p>that the GOP wants to know precisely what it is the USG wants </p><p>the GOP to do to alleviate the tension.  Ambassador thanked </p><p>Tarawneh for conveying the message and said he would report </p><p>their conversation to Department. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT.  Post passes this message to Department at </p><p>the request of the GOJ.  The Jordanians feel obligated to </p><p>pass the message, but are aware that the USG is in direct </p><p>contact with Islamabad on this matter. END COMMENT. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
