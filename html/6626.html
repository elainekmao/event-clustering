COBURN AND C. WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT OIL UPDATE -- MARCH 21, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 1010 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reasons 1.5. (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Detailed breakdown of Kuwaiti oil production is not </p><p>available today.  A senior KPC official told EconChief today </p><p>that production in the previous 24 hours reached 2.5 million </p><p>barrels.  He said that loading operations were proceeding as </p><p>normal, although there had been some movements of tankers in </p><p>anchorage areas overnight due to due to Iraqi missile </p><p>launches that landed in the Persian Gulf due East of Kuwait\'s </p><p>refinery complex and loading facilities at Shuaibah. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Because of those missile attacks, KNPC has shut down </p><p>one of three LPG trains and is reducing its refinery </p><p>throughput from 900,000 barrels per day to 625,000 barrels </p><p>per day.  The official explained that this will allow for a </p><p>much safer and more controlled shutdown in case missile </p><p>attacks or other incidents require it. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) The official also noted that the shutdown of the LPG </p><p>train means that KPC is now flaring more gas in its </p><p>production fields (adding to the smoke generated by oil well </p><p>fires now burning in Southern Iraq). </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Finally, the official noted that KOC had received a </p><p>request directly from U.S. military officials to use water </p><p>supplies in Kuwait\'s Northern fields for use in fire fighting </p><p>efforts inside Iraq, a request KOC granted. </p><p> </p><p>5.(U) Local press reports today note the impacts of Iraqi </p><p>missiles off the coast of the Shuaibah Industrial Area, and </p><p>quote Saad al-Shuaib, Chairman of the Kuwait National </p><p>Petroleum Corporation as saying that all operations in the </p><p>Industrial Area continue as normal and that no damage was </p><p>reported as a result of the attacks. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
