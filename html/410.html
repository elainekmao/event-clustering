THE PLO MAINTAINS AN EMBASSY IN </p><p>MONGOLIA, BUT AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, MIDDLE EAST </p><p>ISSUES AND THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM WORLDWIDE RECEIVE </p><p>SCANT ATTENTION HERE.  THERE WERE NO INSTANCES OF </p><p>TERRORISM IN MONGOLIA OR ANY TERRORIST INCIDENTS IN </p><p>WHICH MONGOLIA IS ACCUSED OF BEING INVOLVED DURING THE </p><p>PAST YEAR.  ANY CHANGE IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE </p><p>TOWARD TERRORISM, IF THERE HAS BEEN ANY CHANGE, WOULD </p><p>PROBABLY BE POSITIVE, GIVEN THE DEMOCRATIZATION THAT </p><p>IS TAKING PLACE IN THE NATION AND ITS ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>FORGE CLOSER TIES WITH THE INDUSTRIALIZED AND </p><p>NON-SOCIALIST COUNTRIES OF NORTH AMERICA, ASIA, AND </p><p>EUROPE.  MONGOLIAN STATEMENTS ON EAST-WEST AND </p><p>NORTH-SOUTH ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA HAVE A </p><p>NOTICEABLY MILDER TONE THAN IN THE PAST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENKO </p><p></p></div>
