AMMAN 313 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 793 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA GREGORY L. BERRY.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In response to the repeated requests from senior </p><p>Jordanians that the USG ask the UN to modify Oil for Food </p><p>Program (OFF) procedures so as to minimize the risk to the </p><p>Jordanian banking system of contracts that cannot be </p><p>delivered to Baghdad under wartime circumstances (ref a), the </p><p>Ambassador urged Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher on February </p><p>5 and Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb on February 6 to </p><p>approach the Office of the Iraq Program (OIP) directly.  The </p><p>Ambassador said that Jordan was in the best position to make </p><p>the most compelling and substantiated case about the exposure </p><p>of Jordan\'s banking system. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Muasher replied that the GOJ would like the UNSC to </p><p>approve an alternate site in Jordan to which OFF goods could </p><p>be delivered and the terms of the suppliers\' contracts </p><p>considered complete.  The GOJ had not made a formal approach </p><p>to OIP to suggest such a plan, he commented, on the advice of </p><p>the Jordanian Ambassador in Washington, who recommended that </p><p>Jordan "wait a couple of weeks" based on his contacts with </p><p>the USG.  When the Ambassador raised the subject with PM Abul </p><p>Ragheb, the PM immediately called Muasher to make sure that </p><p>the Jordanian mission in New York was prepared to make such </p><p>an approach to OIP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Comment:  The potential described by the Jordanian </p><p>government of even limited bank failures to have a widespread </p><p>ripple effect on the banking system and the economy as a </p><p>whole appears well-founded.  Even though the banking system </p><p>as a whole is well-capitalized, a few individual banks are </p><p>heavily exposed to OFF contracts.  In several cases, these </p><p>same individual banks were already weakened by the Shamailah </p><p>banking scandal earlier this year, with two of them taken </p><p>over by the Central Bank for restructuring (ref b).  The CBJ </p><p>currently believes that it has the resources to handle an </p><p>expected low-level of capital flight at the beginning of a </p><p>conflict.  However, if even isolated banks should be unable </p><p>to make good on their commitments because of defaults on OFF </p><p>contracts and further central bank takeovers were required, </p><p>limited capital flight could quickly become major capital </p><p>flight in what would be an already deeply unsettled political </p><p>environment. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Such a scenario could jeopardize the payments system </p><p>and shake the economic -- and political -- confidence in </p><p>which the United States has invested so much in Jordan.  This </p><p>is not a risk worth running.  Reasonably, the Jordanians </p><p>think they will not get anywhere with the OIP or UN </p><p>Secretariat without U.S. support.  It only seems prudent for </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the United States to intervene now with the UN to ensure that </p><p>this issue is managed so as not to cause unnecessary economic </p><p>or political problems directly contrary to U.S. interests. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  We also point out the importance PRM PDAS Rich </p><p>Greene recently described to us of keeping OFF deliveries </p><p>flowing into Iraq during and especially after a conflict. </p><p>The Jordanians may have alerted us to a potential weak link </p><p>in the financial network that supports OFF deliveries.  A </p><p>mechanism that allowed goods to be held outside Iraq for </p><p>immediate delivery in Iraq as soon as conditions permitted </p><p>would seem to reduce the chances of a blockage in OFF flows. </p><p>Indeed, the potential for such a blockage appears from the </p><p>fact that Jordanian bankers tell us that they have </p><p>substantially reduced their financing of OFF contracts in </p><p>response to the financial risk described above.  This has, </p><p>they say, been reflected in a probable curtailment by more </p><p>than half of OFF flows to Iraq via Jordan over the past </p><p>six-eight months. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
