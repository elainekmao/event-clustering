<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002176 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION U.S./IRAQ STANDOFF; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under title "Will the drums of war quieten?" the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its </p><p>      September 29 editorial to encouraging President Bush </p><p>      to heed "international public opinion" against a </p><p>      unilateral attack on Iraq by the United States. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Iraqi President Saddam Hussein\'s move to allow </p><p>      UN arms inspectors unfettered access to his country\'s </p><p>      military facilities has deflated America\'s argument </p><p>      for an attack against him, and it appears the U.S. is </p><p>      increasingly losing the moral high ground on which to </p><p>      legitimize a unilateral strike.  Already, there is </p><p>      dissent in the U.S. Congress, with the Democrats </p><p>      challenging President George Bush\'s proposed war, </p><p>      while in Britain, America\'s closest ally in the anti- </p><p>      Saddam Hussein crusade, even Labor parliamentarians </p><p>      have strongly argued against subordinating British </p><p>      foreign policy to Bush\'s war plans.  With France, </p><p>      Russia and China - the other members of the powerful </p><p>      U. N. Security Council - resisting America\'s war to </p><p>      topple Saddam Hussein, and the preponderant global </p><p>      anti-war sentiment, will the U.S. finally heed </p><p>      international public opinion and shelve its </p><p>      unilateralist path?." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
