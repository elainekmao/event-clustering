<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 001214 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR JBUNTIN </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/DGUGLIELMI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECIN, ETRD, ECON, KU, GCC </p><p>SUBJECT: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY RATIFIES CUSTOMS LAW </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 673 </p><p>     B. 02 KUWAIT 5543 </p><p> </p><p>1. During its April 1, 2003 session, Kuwait\'s National </p><p>Assembly ratified and referred to the Council of Ministers a </p><p>draft unified customs law for Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) </p><p>states.  Kuwait remains the lone member of the six-nation GCC </p><p>yet to formally agree on the legal side of the GCC Customs </p><p>Union, which was officially launched January 1, 2003 (ref A). </p><p>  Kuwait\'s Amir agreed to the law in principle last year, </p><p>enabling Kuwait to join the Customs Union (ref B).  The draft </p><p>law was scheduled to be passed nearly a year ago, but stalled </p><p>in the National Assembly waiting approval. Under the new law, </p><p>all goods entering Kuwait will be subject to a 5 percent </p><p>customs tax, which is the same percentage in each of the </p><p>other GCC member states. </p><p> </p><p>2. Kuwait\'s Constitution stipulates that the Amir has 30 days </p><p>to sign the draft into law.  From the National Assembly, the </p><p>proposal will be forwarded to the Council of Ministers, who </p><p>will then prepare a decree, which, under Article 65 of </p><p>Kuwait\'s Constitution, the Amir must sign into law within 30 </p><p>days submission from the National Assembly. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
