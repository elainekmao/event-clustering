IT WAS AN </p><p>   UNSPOKEN NATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT THE MAN HAD BECOME </p><p>   AN UNSUSTAINABLE LIABILITY TO THE COUNTRY AND </p><p>   SHOULD HAVE NO FURTHER BUSINESS RUNNING THE AFFAIRS </p><p>   OF STATE.  IT IS. . .A VERY SAD COMMENTARY ON A MAN </p><p>   WHO ROSE TO POLITICAL PROMINENCE ON THE BASIS OF </p><p>   HIS UNCOMPROMISING ADVOCACY FOR UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE </p><p>   TO BE SEEN TO HAVE DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DENY </p><p>   HIS FELLOW CITIZENS THAT VERY RIGHT AS THE ONLY WAY </p><p>   OF ENSURING HE HANGS ON TO POWER AGAINST THE WILL </p><p>   OF HIS COMPATRIOTS. . .

THAT THE ZANU </p><p>   PF CANDIDATE WON THE PRESIDENCY AND THAT THE </p><p>   SITUATION IS CALM, IS SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT GOING </p><p>   DOWN WELL IN CERTAIN QUARTERS OF THE WESTERN WORLD. </p><p>   ZIMBABWE IS SUPPOSED TO BE EXPERIENCING A BLOODBATH </p><p>   THIS VERY HOUR BECAUSE THE VOTE WAS \'STOLEN\' FROM </p><p>   THE MDC.
