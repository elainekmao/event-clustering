<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000214 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>CDR PACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BANKING CRISIS CONTINUES; STILL NO EFFECTIVE </p><p>GO0VERNMENT ACTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 213 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA, a.i. Ron McMullen.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Burma\'s banking crisis has continued to build </p><p>in the absence of government action.  Several private banks </p><p>have effectively closed, while the Myanmar Bankers </p><p>Association has agreed to further reduce the limits on </p><p>withdrawals to only 200,000 kyat (i.e., $200) per account per </p><p>week.  Government banks have continued to operate normally, </p><p>but their deposits represent only a small fraction of the </p><p>entire banking system\'s.  Moreover, even their operations </p><p>have been interrupted to a degree by the problems at the </p><p>private banks.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Burma\'s banking crisis continued unabated on February </p><p>19 in the absence of any effective government response. </p><p>While the Central Bank has reportedly extended emergency </p><p>credits to several banks and brought in several truckloads of </p><p>bills to meet the banks demands for cash, the government </p><p>itself has still not issued any statement regarding its </p><p>intent to support the private banks.  Some of the </p><p>government\'s steps have even been counterproductive.  On </p><p>February 17, the government instructed Myawaddy Bank, which </p><p>is affiliated with the Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited </p><p>(MEHL), to transfer all official government and military </p><p>accounts to the Myanmar Economic Corporation\'s Inwaa Bank. </p><p>This order had nothing to do with the banking crisis; it was </p><p>essentially precipitated by MEHL\'s fall from grace as the </p><p>favored military corporation in country.  Nevertheless, 5 </p><p>billion kyat in deposits crossed the street, putting the </p><p>joint venture Myawaddy Bank in trouble along with the private </p><p>banks. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As might be expected under these circumstances, lines </p><p>have continued to form in front of all the private banks, </p><p>forcing several to effectively close.  Meanwhile, the Myanmar </p><p>Bankers Association (an unoffical grouping of private </p><p>bankers) agreed on February 18 to further reduce the limit on </p><p>withdrawals from 500,000 to 200,000 kyat (i.e., about $200) </p><p>per account per week.  There are also increasing signs of </p><p>payment problems, in part because some of the steps taken by </p><p>the private banks ostensibly to slow withdrawals (e.g., a ban </p><p>on account transfers even between branches of the same bank). </p><p> That ban may facilitate controls on withdrawals, but it also </p><p>makes it nearly impossible for any company to do business. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Thus far, fortunately, only private banks have been </p><p>affected by the crisis.  Government-owned banks such as </p><p>Myanmar Economic Bank, Myanmar Investment and Commercial </p><p>Bank, and the Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank have all continued </p><p>to operate normally without restrictions on withdrawals. </p><p>However, even they have been affected in cases where they </p><p>have to arrange settlements through the private banks.  For </p><p>instance, MFTB regularly redeems foreign currency by </p><p>crediting the customer\'s kyat account at a local bank.  With </p><p>private banks shutting down and limiting withdrawals, </p><p>however, few customers want to see their accounts credited </p><p>with any amount of kyat.  Moreover, the relative confidence </p><p>people seem to have in government-owned banks does not </p><p>reflect the quality of their operations.  Rather, the public </p><p>appears simply to believe that the government is far more </p><p>likely to stand behind its own banks than the private banks. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Finally, observers are increasingly sensitive to the </p><p>potential political consequences of this crisis.  One of the </p><p>best economic correspondents in country believes that </p><p>mismanagement of this crisis could signal the beginning of </p><p>the end for this government, or at least its current economic </p><p>policy.  On February 18, he received "a panicky call" from </p><p>the Office of the Chief of Military Intelligence asking him </p><p>to do an options paper for GOB review.  He has recommended, </p><p>he said, government guarantees of deposits scaled to the size </p><p>of deposits (e.g., 100 percent for small depositors and </p><p>running down to zero for those over a certain limit).  He has </p><p>also recommended triage for the troubled banks, though </p><p>whether the government has the capacity to pick the good </p><p>banks from the bad remains to be tested. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In short, the public is now waiting on the GOB, which </p><p>needs to make clear how it intends to deal with this crisis. </p><p>If it does nothing, or waits too long to sort out the mess, </p><p>it could find itself faced with increasing political as well </p><p>as economic problems. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
