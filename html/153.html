<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 ALEXANDRIA 00291 </p><p> </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD HOWELL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, ECON, PINR, SOCI, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISLAMIC TRILOGY, PART II:  LEADERS AND </p><p>          MOSQUES OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A)  ALEXANDRIA 00289 </p><p>      (B)  ALEXANDRIA 00290 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  THIS TELEGRAM TRANSMITS </p><p>PART II OF OUR REPORT ON THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA AND IDENTIFIES SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>SPIRITUAL AND (POTENTIALLY) POLITICAL LEADERS IN </p><p>THIS CITY AND THE MAIN "RADICAL" MOSQUES.  WHILE </p><p>THERE ARE DOUBTLESS MANY DIVISIONS BETWEEN VARIOUS </p><p>FACTIONS, THERE ARE ALSO SUGGESTIONS THAT THE </p><p>ISLAMIC RIGHT IS BETTER ORGANIZED THAN SOME </p><p>OBSERVERS SUGGEST.  THIS MAY ACCOUNT, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>FOR THE "ISLAMIC GAMAAT\'S" RECURRING SUCCESSES </p><p>IN ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY\'S STUDENT UNION ELECTIONS. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE ORGANIZATION, DISCIPLINE, AND WELL- </p><p>FINANCED MASS PUBLIC PRAYER MEETINGS HELD AT THE </p><p>END OF RAMADAN AND THE BEGINNING OF THE \'ID AL-IDHA </p><p>SUGGEST THERE MUST BE MORE LINKAGES BETWEEN </p><p>PRINCIPAL LEADERS AND VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAN </p><p>MEETS THE EYE.  ANOTHER INTERESTING POINT IS THE </p><p>CONTINUED ACTIVISM IN ALEXANDRIA OF MANY OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC STUDENT LEADERS OF THE 1970\'S, EVEN THOUGH </p><p>THEY HAVE NOW LEFT SCHOOL, ENTERED THE WORK PLACE, </p><p>AND MAINTAIN A LOW PROFILE.  THEY MAY NO LONGER </p><p>BE DEMONSTRATING IN THE STREETS, BUT THEIR </p><p>COMMITMENT TO AN ISLAMIC EGYPT APPEARS, IN MANY </p><p>CASES AT LEAST, UNABATED.  FUTURE POST REPORTING </p><p>WILL ATTEMPT TO EXPLORE THEIR ACTIVITIES AND </p><p>THEIR IMPACT ON ALEXANDRIA\'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT IN GREATER DETAIL.  END SUMMARY AND </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>THE SPIRITUAL AND (POTENTIALLY) POLITICAL LEADERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>3.  WITH PERIODIC EXCEPTIONS, LEADERS OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA NO LONGER CAPTURE </p><p>THE NATIONAL NEWSPAPER HEADLINES AS THEY DID IN </p><p>THE LATE 1970\'S AND EARLY 1980\'S, WHEN TWO </p><p>ALEXANDRIAN CLERICS, AHMAD AL-MAHALLAWI AND </p><p>MAHMUD EID, WERE AMONG  THE BEST KNOWN OF EGYPT\'S </p><p>"RADICAL" SHAYKHS.  NEVERTHELESS, THE ISLAMIC </p><p>RIGHT\'S SPIRITUAL AND (POTENTIALLY) POLITICAL </p><p>RANKS ARE FAR FROM EMPTY.  SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS, </p><p>SOME IDENTIFIED OPENLY WITH THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, </p><p>HAVE FOLLOWINGS IN ALEXANDRIA AND CAN BE CONSIDERED </p><p>THE ISLAMIC RIGHT\'S LEADING SPIRITUAL AND (POTENTIALLY) </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERS.  THEY ARE BUTTRESSED BY THE </p><p>LEADERS OF THE NUMEROUS "ISLAMIC GAMAAT" OR </p><p>GROUPS.  THE LATTER ARE FOCUSED LARGELY, BUT </p><p>NOT EXCLUSIVELY, ON THE ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY </p><p>CAMPUS.  INCREASINGLY, WE HAVE DETECTED "GAMAAT" </p><p>ACTIVITY AMONG YOUNG PROFESSIONALS, AND MANY OF </p><p>THE "GAMAAT" LEADERS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY </p><p>ARE DRAWN FROM THIS LATTER CATEGORY.  FINALLY, </p><p>THERE ARE OTHER ISLAMIC RIGHT LEADERS WHO ARE MEMBERS </p><p>OF SECULAR POLITICAL PARTIES.  THESE MEN ARE NOT </p><p>ALL NECESSARILY "RADICAL" IN THEIR RELIGIOUS </p><p>VIEWPOINTS, AND SOME ARE CONSIDERED POLITICAL </p><p>OPPORTUNISTS WHO HAVE SIMPLY "ADOPTED" THE ISLAMIC </p><p>TREND IN ORDER TO FURTHER THEIR OWN POLITICAL </p><p>AMBITIONS.  WHETHER THEY WILL SURVIVE THE ELECTORAL </p><p>LIST VETTING NOW UNDERWAY IN PREPARATION FOR </p><p>THE APRIL 6 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION REMAINS TO BE SEEN. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>4.  JUST AS INDIVIDUAL LEADERS ARE NO LONGER AS </p><p>VISIBLE AS THEY WERE, SO TOO IS IT DIFFICULT TO </p><p>PINPOINT INDIVIDUAL MOSQUES AS PARTICULAR "HOTBEDS" </p><p>OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT.  IN THIS MESSAGE, WE HAVE </p><p>DENOTED SEVERAL OF THE MOSQUES WITH ACTIVE IMAMS </p><p>AND CONGREGATIONS, BUT NONE OF THEM APPROACHES, </p><p>EITHER SYMBOLICALLY OR POLITICALLY, THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>WHICH SHAYKH AL-MAHALLAWI\'S "QA\'ID IBRAHIM" </p><p>MOSQUE HAD BEFORE 1981. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>5.  WHAT THIS ALL MEANS IS OPEN TO DEBATE.  SOME </p><p>INSIST, UNCONVINCINGLY, THAT THE ISLAMIC LEADERSHIP </p><p>IN ALEXANDRIA, AS ELSEWHERE IN EGYPT, HAS NO </p><p>CENTRAL ORGANIZATION.  THEY DEPICT THE ISLAMIC </p><p>RIGHT HERE AS BEING LITTLE MORE THAN NUMEROUS, </p><p>HIGHLY INDIVIDUALISTIC, RELIGIOUS GROUPS WITH NO </p><p>COMMON AGENDA AND LITTLE CONTACT AMONG ONE </p><p>ANOTHER WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THEIR SUCCESS IN </p><p>LOCAL ELECTIONS HAS BEEN MODEST. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>6.  OTHER INFORMED OBSERVERS (INCLUDING A GOOD </p><p>SOURCE IN STATE SECURITY) ARE CONVINCED THAT THE </p><p>LEADERS OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT CONSCIOUSLY ADOPTED </p><p>A "LOWER PROFILE" IN ORDER TO AVOID RENEWED GOE </p><p>RETRIBUTION ON THE SCALE OF SADAT\'S 1981 CRACKDOWN </p><p>WHILE DEVELOPING ROOTS AMONG THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES </p><p>AND FOLLOWERS.  WHILE CONCEDING THAT THERE IS </p><p>COMPETITION AMONG VARIOUS ELEMENTS COMPRISING THE </p><p>ISLAMIC RIGHT, THEY POINT BOTH TO PRESIDENT SADAT\'S </p><p>1981 ASSERTION THAT THE "ISLAMIC GAMAAT" ARE </p><p>ESSENTIALLY AN MB-SPONSORED UNDERGROUND AND TO THE </p><p>ISLAMIC RIGHT\'S WELL-COORDINATED ORCHESTRATION OF </p><p>UNIVERSITY STUDENT UNION ELECTIONS AND THE MASS </p><p>PUBLIC PRAYER MEETINGS AT THE ALEXANDRIA STADIUM </p><p>WHICH MOBILIZE OVER 100,000 WORSHIPPERS TWICE YEARLY. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>7.  WE HAVE DIVIDED THE ISLMAIC RIGHT\'S SPIRITUAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP IN ALEXANDRIA INTO THREE SEPARATE </p><p>CATEGORIES.  AS NONE OF THESE MEN CURRENTLY HOLDS </p><p>AN IMPORTANT POSITION (ASIDE FROM POSSIBLE </p><p>MEMBERSHIP) WITHIN A POLITICAL PARTY, THE SEMI-LEGAL </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OR ANY OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPING, </p><p>THEIR POLITICAL INFLUENCE IS STILL MORE POTENTIAL </p><p>THAN REAL.  ON THE ONE HAND, THERE IS NO WAY OF </p><p>KNOWING AS YET THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY HARBOR </p><p>PERSONAL POLITICAL AMBITIONS.  ON THE OTHER, </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT PROPITIOUS FOR THEM TO ENTER </p><p>THE POLITICAL ARENA EVEN IF THEY SHOULD WANT TO. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>8.  PRINCIPAL INFLUENCES: </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(A)  AHMAD AL-MAHALLAWI, IMAM OF AL-QA\'ID IBRAHIM </p><p>MOSQUE:  SINCE HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 1982, </p><p>AL-MAHALLAWI HAS TAKEN A LOWER PROFILE IN </p><p>ISLAMIC AFFAIRS.  USUALLY HIS FRIDAY SERMONS </p><p>FOCUS ON RELIGIOUS MATTERS, NOT POLITICS (ONE </p><p>EXCEPTION WAS HIS ANTI-ISRAEL BLAST FOLLOWING </p><p>THE SEPTEMBER 1986 ALEXANDRIA SUMMIT).  AN </p><p>ASCETIC TYPE WHO LIVES HUMBLY, AL-MAHALLAWI IS </p><p>QUITE ALOOF AND DOES NOT IMPRESS A WESTERNER AS </p><p>A PERSONALITY WITH MUCH CHARISMA.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>HE RETAINS CONSIDERABLE STATURE IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p>AND HAS A DEVOTED FOLLOWING.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>OPPOSIION PRESS REPORTS, IT WAS AL-MAHALLAWI\'S </p><p>ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS A MOSQUE IN ASYUT LAST YEAR </p><p>WHICH SPARKED A SERIOUS CLASH BETWEEN ISLAMIC </p><p>RADICALS AND SECURITY POLICE.  IN GENERAL, AL- </p><p>MAHALLAWI\'S RHETORIC HAS MELLOWED IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS, ALTHOUGH HE REMAINS A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE </p><p>OF AN ISLAMIC STATE.  SINCE THE SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>OF NEW PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, RUMORS HAVE </p><p>CIRCULATED THAT AL-MAHALLAWI WILL BE A CANDIDATE </p><p>FOR ONE OF THE INDEPENDENT SEATS.  IF HE RUNS (AND </p><p>IF THE ELECTIONS ARE FAIR), OBSERVERS BELIEVE HE WILL </p><p>BE DIFFICULT TO BEAT. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(B)  MAHMOUD EID (AKA MAHMUD \'ID):  ALONG WITH </p><p>AL-MAHALLAWI, EID WAS VERY ACTIVE IN THE LATE 1970\'S. </p><p>HE HAS SPENT MOST OF THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE </p><p>GULF, ALTHOUGH HE IS SAID TO RETAIN A DEVOTED </p><p>FOLLOWING IN ALEXANDRIA.  HE IS ALSO ALLEGED TO </p><p>RETAIN SEVERAL OF THE RADICAL ISLAMIC VIEWS </p><p>WHICH GOT HIM INTO TROUBLE WITH THE LATE PRESIDENT </p><p>SADAT. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(C)  MUHAMMAD AL-MARAGHI:  A WAFDIST MEMBER OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY, AL-MARAGHI IS KNOWN LOCALLY AS </p><p>A LEADING MEMBER OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </p><p>AND SPIRITUAL LEADER TO SOME OF THE "ISLAMIC </p><p>GAMAAT" (GROUPS) IN THE CITY.  IN HIS LATE FORTIES </p><p>OR EARLY FIFTIES, HE IS KNOWN AS A FORCEFUL </p><p>SPEAKER WHO IS TOTALLY COMMITTED TO AN ISLAMIC </p><p>STATE IN EGYPT.  HOSTILE TO THE U.S. AND ITS </p><p>POLICIES.  AL-MARAGHI SEEMS TO HAVE ALMOST AS </p><p>MANY DETRACTORS AS HE HAS ADMIRERS, AND HIS </p><p>REELECTION TO THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY IN THE FORTHCOMING </p><p>ELECTIONS IS IN DOUBT. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(D)  ADEL EID (AKA ADIL \'ID):  AN ARTICULATE AND </p><p>RADICAL ALEXANDRIAN LAWYER, EID IS ALLEGED TO </p><p>HAVE CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IN RADICAL ISLAMIC </p><p>CIRCLES AND, LIKE AL-MARAGHI, TO BE THE SPIRITUAL </p><p>LEADER OF SOME LOCAL "ISLAMIC GAMAAT."  ARDENTLY </p><p>ANTI-U.S. AND ANTI-ISRAEL, HE ONCE INDICATED HE </p><p>WOULD ONLY COME TO CG\'S RESIDENCE IF HE COULD BE </p><p>CONVINCED "NO ISRAELIS WERE PRESENT."  HE WASN\'T, </p><p>AND HE DIDN\'T COME.  EID IS ALSO MENTIONED AS A </p><p>POSSIBLE CANDIDATE FOR THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(E)  YASSIN RUSHDI:  RUSHDI WAS ALLEGEDLY A </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHER AT ONE TIME.  HE IS A FORMER NAVAL </p><p>OFFICER WHO WAS BOOTED OUT OF THE MILITARY BY </p><p>NASSER FOR HIS ISLAMIC ACTIVISM.  NOT RESPECTED </p><p>AS A SCHOLAR (HE HAS NO SUCH CREDENTIALS), </p><p>RUSHDI IS NEVERTHELESS KNOWN AS A CHARISMATIC </p><p>AND ARTICULATE LEADER WHO HAS A LARGE AND DEVOTED </p><p>FOLLOWING DRAWN FROM THE MIDDLE AND UPPER MIDDLE </p><p>CLASSES.  HIS SERMONS AND LECTURES ARE AVAILABLE </p><p>ON WIDELY-SOLD TAPES.  RUSHDI\'S LARGE AND TASTEFUL </p><p>MOSQUE ("AL-MOWASSAT") IS JAMMED AT PRAYER TIMES </p><p>AND FOR HIS EVENING LECTURES.  HE IS KNOWN GENERALLY </p><p>TO SHY AWAY FROM POLITICAL SUBJECTS AND EMPHASIZE </p><p>PERSONAL PIETY.  ABOUT FIFTY, HE WELL OFF OWING </p><p>TO A CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS HE OPERATES ON THE </p><p>SIDE.  BECAUSE OF HIS ALLEGED MAGNETIC HOLD ON </p><p>UPPER CLASS WOMEN, HE HAS BEEN TERMED BY SOME HERE </p><p>AS "THE RASPUTIN OF ALEXANDRIA." </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>9.  LEADERS OF ALEXANDRIA\'S "ISLAMIC GAMAAT": </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(A)  AHMAD MAHMUD NAFIS HAMDI:  A LEADER OF THE </p><p>"ISLAMIC GAMAAT" AT ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY\'S </p><p>ENGINEERING FACULTY, HAMDI WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT </p><p>OF THE STUDENT UNION IN EARLY DECEMBER 1986. </p><p>VERY RELIGIOUS, HE IS SAID TO BE NON-CONFRONTATIONAL </p><p>AND VERY PERSONABLE. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(B)  WAGIH MUHAMMAD ABU HALIMA:  CURRENTLY VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE ALEXANDRIA STUDENT UNION, ABU </p><p>HALIMA IS ONE OF THE "GAMAAT" LEADERS IN THE </p><p>MEDICAL SCHOOL, THE FACULTY WHICH PERHAPS SHOWS </p><p>MORE ISLAMIC MANIFESTATIONS THAN ANY OF THE </p><p>OTHERS.  HE IS SAID TO BE MORE VOCAL AND AMBITIOUS </p><p>THAN HAMDI. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(C)  KHALID ABD AL-RAHMAN AL-ZAFARANI:  HEAD OF </p><p>THE PHYSICIANS SYNDICATE IN ALEXANDRIA, </p><p>AL-ZAFARANI ACCORDING TO ONE SOURCE IS FRIENDLY </p><p>WITH (AND ONCE THE EMPLOYEE OF) DR. ALI MEHELBA, </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE ANDALUS ACID COMPANY (SEE PART III). </p><p>AL-ZAFARANI IS VERY ACTIVE IN THE "GAMAAT" </p><p>MOVEMENT.  IN HIS MID-30\'S, HE HAS FLIRTED WITH </p><p>VARIOUS FACTIONS OVER THE PAST DECADE, INCLUDING </p><p>"AL-TAKFIR W\'AL-HIJRA" IN ITS FORMATIVE YEARS. </p><p>CURRENT ORGANIZATIONAL AFFILIATIONS ARE UNKNOWN. </p><p>AL-ZAFARANI IS SAID TO BE CHARISMATIC.  HE AVOIDS </p><p>WESTERNERS AND STAYS OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT.  STATE </p><p>SECURITY TELLS US HE WAS A LEADER OF THE "GAMAAT" </p><p>MOVEMENT EARLY IN THE DECADE AND WAS IMPRISONED </p><p>FOR HIS ACTIVITIES IN 1981.  HE CONTINUES TO BE </p><p>UNDER SURVEILLANCE.  MANY SOURCES IN ISLAMIC CIRCLES </p><p>HERE BELIEVE AL-ZAFARANI MAY BE CONSIDERING A HIGHER </p><p>PROFILE.  THEY HAVE SUGGESTED TO US HE MAY BECOME </p><p>A CANDIDATE FOR THE APRIL 6 PEOPLES ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(D)  SAMIH SAID HASAN AL-SABA:  CURRENTLY 27 YEARS </p><p>OLD AND THE FORMER HEAD OF THE "GAMAAT" IN THE </p><p>ALEXANDRIA MEDICAL FACULTY, AL-SABA WAS IMPRISONED </p><p>IN 1981 AND SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASED.  HE IS </p><p>ALLEGEDLY A FOLLOWER OF AL-ZAFARANI, AND STATE </p><p>SECURITY ALLEGES SOMETIMES ENGAGES IN ANTI-REGIME </p><p>AND ANTI-AMERICAN PAMPHLETERRING (THE LAST TIME </p><p>APPARENTLY DURING THE "ACHILLE LAURO" EPISODE). </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(E)  SABRI NUR:  IN HIS FIFTIES, NUR IS AN OLDER, </p><p>BUT CHARISMATIC AND ARTICULATE, LEADER OF ONE </p><p>OF THE ISLAMIC GROUPS IN ALEXANDRIA WHICH IS </p><p>BELIEVED TO SUPPORT SHAYKH SALAH ABU ISMAIL. </p><p>NUR VOICES AN EXTREMIST POLITICAL AGENDA AND </p><p>CLAIMS TO HAVE A LARGE AND YOUTHFUL  FOLLOWING. </p><p>HE IS PERIODICALLY THE SUBJECT OF PRESS INTERVIEWS </p><p>AND COMMENTARY IN THE LIBERALS\' WEEKLY NEWSPAPER, </p><p>"AL-AHRAR." </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(F)  AHMAD AL-SAYYID HATAYBA:  TWENTY-NINE YEARS </p><p>OF AGE, HATAYBA WAS THE HEAD OF THE ISLAMIC </p><p>GROUP IN THE ALEXANDRIA FACULTY OF DENTISTRY </p><p>UNTIL HIS 1981 ARREST.  HE IS CONSIDERED MORE </p><p>POLITICIZED THAN SOME OF HIS FELLOW "GAMAAT" </p><p>LEADERS AND IS SAID TO FREQUENTLY CRITICIZE GOE </p><p>POLICIES. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(G)  FAHMI MUHAMMAD AMER:  ANOTHER OF AL-ZAFARANI\'S </p><p>ALLEGED PROTEGES, AMER IN THE PAST HAS BEEN </p><p>ACTIVE IN THE "FAJR AL-ISLAM" MOVEMENT (SEE </p><p>PART III).  HE WAS A LEADER OF THE "GAMAAT" </p><p>MOVEMENT IN THE FACULTY OF ARTS DURING HIS </p><p>STUDENT YEARS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(H)  MAJDI MUHAMMAD HASAN RAJAB WARDA (AKA </p><p>MAGDI WARDA):  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PINPOINT </p><p>THE MOSQUE WHERE WARDA IS CURRENTLY ACTIVE. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE UNDERSTAND THAT IN HIS ACTIVE YEARS </p><p>AT ALEXANDRIA\'S LAW FACULTY HE WAS A VOCAL AND </p><p>HARSH CRITIC OF THE COPTS AND STILL DELIVERS </p><p>ANTI-CHRISTIAN  AND ANTI-JEWISH POLEMICS PERIODICALLY </p><p>FROM ANY ONE OF THE DOZENS OF PRIVATE MOSQUES </p><p>IN THE CITY. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>10.  ISLAMIC VOICES IN THE ALEX BRANCHES OF THE </p><p>SECULAR PARTIES: </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(A)  HAMMAD AL-KHAYYAL:  A NDP MEMBER OF THE </p><p>PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, AL-KHAYYAL IS BEARDED AND </p><p>ESPOUSES RELIGIOUS CAUSES.  ALEXANDRIANS ARE </p><p>SUSPICIOUS OF HIS MOTIVES.  AL-KHAYYAL IS </p><p>ALLEGED BY THESE SOURCES TO BE A LEFTIST WHO </p><p>IS USING HIS NEW ISLAMIC GUISE TO FURTHER HIS </p><p>OWN POLITICAL AIMS.  SOME IN THE NDP ARE TRYING TO </p><p>REMOVE HIM FROM THE PARTY LIST FOR THE FORTHCOMING </p><p>ELECTIONS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(B)  AHMAD AL-SHARNOUBI (AKA AL-SHARNUBI):  LIKE </p><p>AL-KHAYYAL, AL-SHARNOUBI IS BEARDED AND STRONGLY </p><p>SUPPORTS ISLAMIC ISSUES (E.G., HE FAVORS </p><p>PROHIBITION AND ADOPTION OF THE "SHARIA").  HE </p><p>IS ALSO CONSIDERED BY SOME HERE AS A CLOSET LEFTIST. </p><p>HE IS AN NDP MEMBER OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY.  SOME </p><p>LOCAL PARTY OFFICIALS WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM REMOVED </p><p>FROM THE FORTHCOMING PARTY LIST. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(C)  MUSTAFA EL GUEINDY (AKA MUSTAFA AL-GUINDI): </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE RELIGIOUS COMMITTEE OF THE PEOPLES </p><p>ASSEMBLY, AL-GUINDI IS ALSO A SECONDARY SCHOOL </p><p>ARABIC TEACHER AND THE IMAM OF KABARI MOSQUE IN </p><p>WEST ALEXANDRIA.  HE IS VERY RELIGIOUS BUT </p><p>REGARDED AS A MODERATE. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(D)  DR. AHMAD SAYYID DARWISH:  ACTIVE AS WELL IN </p><p>THE LOCAL BRANCH OF THE LIBERALS ("AL-AHRAR") PARTY. </p><p>DARWISH IS THE HEAD OF THE PARTY\'S YOUTH ORGANIZATION </p><p>IN ALBANJNDRIA.  O NIS BEING PROMOTED AS A CANDIDATE </p><p>FOR THE NEW PEOPLES ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS.  HE IS IN </p><p>HIS LATE FIFTIES OR EARLY SIXTIES AND IS SUSPICIOUS </p><p>OF WESTERNERS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>RADICAL MOSQUES </p><p>--------------- </p><p>11.  IN THE DAYS WHEN THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES </p><p>OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT HAD A HIGH PROFILE IN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA, TWO MOSQUES WERE THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>FOCAL POINTS FOR ALMOST WEEKLY DEMONSTRATIONS: </p><p>MAHALLAWI\'S "AL-QA\'ID IBRAHIM" MOSQUE AND "AL-SALLAM" </p><p>MOSQUE IN THE BULKLI DISTRICT WHERE SHAYKH MAHMUD </p><p>EID HELD FORTH.  INFLUENCE IS NOW MORE DISPERSED, </p><p>IN PART AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE GOE\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>BRING MORE OF EGYPT\'S ESTIMATED 40,000 PRIVATE </p><p>OR "UNOFFICIAL" MOSQUES UNDER THE CONTROL OF </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF AWQAF.  THIS EFFORT HAS ONLY </p><p>PARTIALLY SUCCEEDED IN ALEXANDRIA WHERE PRIVATELY </p><p>BUILT AND FUNDED MOSQUES CONTINUE TO PROLIFERATE. </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE "GAMAAT" FREQUENTLY COMPRISE THE </p><p>BULK OF THE CONGREGATIONS AT THESE MOSQUES, </p><p>WHERE VERY CONSERVATIVE (BUT NOT NECESSARILY </p><p>POLITICAL) MESSAGES ARE PREACHED EACH FRIDAY AND </p><p>DURING VARIOUS WEEKLY STUDY SESSIONS AND PRAYER </p><p>MEETINGS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>12.  FOLLOWING IS AN ANNOTATED LISTING OF SOME </p><p>OF THE MORE PROMINENT MOSQUES IN ALEXANDRIA WHERE </p><p>THE MORE ACTIVE PROPONENTS OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT </p><p>GATHER: </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(A)  "AL-QA\'ID IBRAHIM" MOSQUE:  AL-MAHALLAWI </p><p>HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THIS MOSQUE, AND </p><p>PERIODICALLY HE WILL ATTRACT LOCAL ATTENTION WITH </p><p>PROVOCATIVE REMARKS IN HIS FRIDAY SERMONS.  AT </p><p>PRESENT, IT IS NOT THE CENTER FOR ISLAMIC ACTIVISM </p><p>THAT IT WAS IN 1980. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(B)  "AL-SALAM MOSQUE":  WITH MUHAMMAD EID OUT OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY, THIS MOSQUE IS NO LONGER AS IMPORTANT </p><p>A GATHERING POINT FOR THE ISLAMIC RIGHT AS IT </p><p>ONCE WAS.  HOWEVER, IT IS STILL FREQUENTED BY </p><p>WORSHIPPERS IN VERY CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC ATTIRE. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(C)  "ASR AL-ISLAM" MOSQUE:  LOCATED ON A MAIN </p><p>STREET IN THE SIDI GABR DISTRICT, THIS MOSQUE </p><p>ATTRACTS FULLY VEILED WOMEN AND BEARDED MEN. </p><p>IT HAS NO SPECIFIC IMAM, BUT MUHAMMAD MARAGHI </p><p>IS SAID TO FREQUENT IT, AND UMAR AL-TALMASANI, </p><p>THE LATE MB LEADER, PREACHED THERE IN 1986. </p><p>ONE SERMON RECENTLY OVERHEARD BY A CONGEN EMPLOYEE </p><p>ATTACKED THE WEALTHY HARSHLY FOR NOT HELPING THE </p><p>POOR.  ANTI-CHRISTIAN AND ANTI-JEWISH SERMONS ARE </p><p>REGULARLY PREACHED, AS WELL.  DURING THE SEPTEMBER 1986 </p><p>ALEXANDRIA SUMMIT, THEN-PRIME MINISTER PERES WAS </p><p>SCORNED IN VERY INSULTING TERMS.  A MEDICAL CLINIC </p><p>OF THE SAME NAME, FOR WOMEN ONLY, IS ASSOCIATED </p><p>WITH THIS MOSQUE AND IS USUALLY CROWDED.  TREATMENT </p><p>IS SAID TO BE GOOD, AND PRICES ARE AFFORDABLE BY </p><p>MIDDLE CLASS EGYPTIANS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(D)  "FAJR AL-ISLAM" MOSQUE:  THIS MOSQUE IS </p><p>ALLEGEDLY RUN BY A GROUP CALLING THEMSELVES, </p><p>"SUPPORTERS OF KHOMEINI"--A STRANGE APPELATION </p><p>AS MOST DEVOUT SUNNIS DO NOT CONSIDER SHIA TO BE </p><p>MUSLIMS.  SERMONS ARE SAID TO BE FREQUENTLY ANTI- </p><p>CHRISTIAN, ALLEGING FOR EXAMPLE, THAT CHRISTIANS </p><p>ARE ATHEISTS WHO WILL SURELY GO TO HELL. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(E)  "FATIH AL-ISLAM" MOSQUE:  LOCATED IN THE </p><p>EXCLUSIVE RUSHDI DISTRICT WHERE MANY DIPLOMATS </p><p>AND WESTERNERS LIVE, THIS MOSQUE WAS BUILT IN </p><p>WHAT WAS INTENDED TO BE A GARAGE.  MOST OF THE </p><p>CONGREGANTS ARE YOUNG, BEARDED, AND WEAR WHITE </p><p>GALIBIYAS.  FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL, SERMONS TEND </p><p>TO BE APOLITICAL, FOCUSING ON INTERPRETATIONS OF </p><p>KORANIC PASSAGES.  THICK GLOVES AND OTHER </p><p>EXTREMIST ACCOUTREMENTS FOR WOMEN ARE SOLD OUTSIDE </p><p>THE MOSQUE ON FRIDAYS. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>(F)  "AL-MOAWASSAT" MOSQUE:  THIS IS THE MOSQUE </p><p>OF YASSIN RUSHDI, THE SO-CALLED "RASPUTIN" OF </p><p>THE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT IN ALEXANDRIA.  RUSHDI IS </p><p>NOT CONSIDERED A POLITICAL RADICAL, BUT HIS </p><p>MOSQUE IS INCLUDED IN THIS LIST BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>NUMBER OF ADHERENTS WHO GATHER HERE EACH WEEK TO </p><p>LISTEN TO HIS SERMONS AND TEACHINGS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAMBLEY </p><p></p></div>
