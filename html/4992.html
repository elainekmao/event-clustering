<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000141 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA (PLEASE PASS TO DAS LIZ CHENEY); IIP/G/NEA/SA; </p><p>NEA/PPD; CHARLOTTE BEERS OFFICE (R); PATRICIA HARRISON AND </p><p>RICK RUTH(ECA) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SCUL, KPAO, OIIP, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE AMMAN ARABIC BOOK </p><p>PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: CAIRO 11622 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  PAS Amman supports PAS Cairo\'s request for </p><p>increased funding, and seeks an additional USD 65,000 </p><p>supplement for Amman\'s Arabic Book Program.  Funds will be </p><p>used to encourage greater initiative on the part of </p><p>publishers and to expand program capacity to publish books </p><p>in support of MEPI and Partnership for Learning initiatives. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Funding Requests: </p><p> </p><p>A.  USD 10,000 for a pilot program to purchase translation </p><p>rights for books pre-selected by Jordanian publishers for </p><p>publication. </p><p> </p><p>---Justification:  Post currently selects books that meet </p><p>Arabic Book Program criteria, secures rights, and awards </p><p>publication to the winning bid from qualified publishers. </p><p>While this process continues to serve our needs, it does </p><p>limit the number of books translated.  Regional publishers </p><p>are, for the most part, inexperienced in the international </p><p>publishing arena and hesitant to initiate book purchases on </p><p>their own.  The pilot project would make available to </p><p>regional publishers modest funds for purchasing translation </p><p>rights to books desired by the publisher and approved by the </p><p>ABP, provided that publishers undertake the negotiation </p><p>process on their own.  Obtaining rights and publishing these </p><p>titles would encourage these publishers to obtain valuable </p><p>experience in contacting American publishers and requesting </p><p>translations rights, negotiating deals, selecting </p><p>forthcoming titles, and closing foreign rights contracts on </p><p>their own in future.  If successful, the pilot project would </p><p>raise publishers\' confidence levels and result in increased </p><p>numbers of American titles published in the region.  Post </p><p>expects to facilitate publishers\' initial efforts in </p><p>international negotiation, through short-term training or </p><p>other hands on assistance. </p><p> </p><p>B. USD 20,000 for expansion of core "American Studies" </p><p>titles. </p><p> </p><p>---Justification:  Post wishes to encourage interest in </p><p>American Studies, and to complement Cairo\'s proposed youth </p><p>literature program, with an expanded list of literary, </p><p>historical and political writings suitable for the </p><p>university audience.  Titles would be chosen in consultation </p><p>with current Fulbright American Studies and Literature </p><p>professors and with other experts in the field.  Translation </p><p>of these titles would make American literature, history and </p><p>political thought more accessible to readers whose English </p><p>reading ability is less than perfect.  Based on our </p><p>observations, many students who are registered in English </p><p>literature courses have difficulty with the material and </p><p>would benefit from having quality Arabic translations ready </p><p>to hand for comparison.  Students who might be hesitant to </p><p>sign up for an American Studies course with reading </p><p>materials entirely in English would feel more comfortable if </p><p>the material was also available in an Arabic version. </p><p> </p><p>Last year\'s 3-volume collection of American Studies </p><p>materials enjoyed tremendous popularity with both students </p><p>and the literary elite. Amman ABP is presently publishing </p><p>Howard Zinn\'s "A People\'s History of the US", and John </p><p>Updike\'s edition of "The Best American Short Stories of the </p><p>Century". "Emerson\'s Essays" was published earlier this </p><p>year, and Gordon Wood\'s "The American Revolution" has been </p><p>assigned for next year.  The requested funds would allow </p><p>publication of an additional 4-6 American Studies titles in </p><p>the coming year. </p><p> </p><p>C. USD 15,000 for translation and publication of recent </p><p>American titles on religious freedom, tolerance, and mutual </p><p>understanding. </p><p>---Justification:  Many new titles on religious freedom, </p><p>faith and tolerance, and shared values between Islam and the </p><p>West have been published in the US in the wake of September </p><p>11. Making the best of these titles available to Arabic </p><p>readers will reinforce understanding of the depth of </p><p>America\'s commitment to religious tolerance, religious </p><p>freedom, and inclusivity.  Funding is requested for </p><p>approximately four titles. </p><p> </p><p>D.  USD 20,000 for translation and publication of titles </p><p>dealing with good governance and civil society. </p><p> </p><p>---Justification:  The issues of democracy, good governance, </p><p>and citizen participation are in the forefront of Arab </p><p>intellectual discussions these days; furthering these </p><p>objectives is of key interest to the US.  There are </p><p>currently very few Arabic translations in this area, very </p><p>little original authorship, and only a few fledgling </p><p>programs at educational institutions and at grassroots </p><p>levels.  Post seeks to support nascent institutional efforts </p><p>as well as provide the Arab literary and intellectual </p><p>opinion leaders with easily accessible and stimulating </p><p>materials that will enhance understanding of these issues </p><p>and raise the level of discussion by inspiring a more </p><p>international outlook in both oral and printed discussions. </p><p>Funding is requested for 5-6 titles in this area.
