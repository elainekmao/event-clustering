<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002332 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/ESC/ESP (GLASS) AND SC/T </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL (DAVID AUFHAUSER) AND TASK </p><p>FORCE ON TERRORIST FINANCING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EFIN, PTER, CVIS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE:  RESPONSE TO REQUEST ON FROZEN </p><p>ASSETS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A. STATE 71056 </p><p>     B. B. STATE 160165 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b), (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) SUMMARY:  Turkish officials could not provide exact </p><p>dollar amounts regarding the seized assets of NASCO Nasreddin </p><p>Holding A.S. or Wa\'el Julaidan\'s import-export firm Meram </p><p>Seyahat.  However, they did inform us that the GOT has frozen </p><p>the assets of the Nasreddin family and that, following the </p><p>November 2002 designation, the Ministry of Interior deported </p><p>the Nasreddins (father and two sons) from Turkey.  A Turkish </p><p>Finance Ministry official complained to us that the U.S. and </p><p>UN have provided a dearth of specific intelligence to assist </p><p>in their efforts.  Furthermore, he complained of a "double </p><p>standard" in which countries like Britain have not applied </p><p>the same pressure on designees as the GOT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Finance Ministry Inspector Hamza Kacar, who is </p><p>leading the investigations into NASCO and Julaidan, informed </p><p>us April 9 that assets have and are currently being seized </p><p>for NASCO Nasreddin but that no assets have been found for </p><p>Julaidan.  (The Finance Ministry takes the lead in </p><p>investigating such cases, through examination of tax </p><p>records.)  He could not provide an exact amount of NASCO\'s </p><p>seized assets, noting that the company is being investigated </p><p>by tax offices throughout the country and no centralized </p><p>authority exists to tally the total amount.  Kacar said that </p><p>the investigation could take as long as a year, because </p><p>NASCO\'s ownership structure has so many affiliates.  Kacar </p><p>complained that the UN designation was vague, and that he did </p><p>not know the extent to which the GOT should investigate </p><p>NASCO\'s affiliates.  (We notified him April 10 that the GOT </p><p>was only obligated to seize and investigate the assets of the </p><p>entities within the Nada/Nasreddin Network that were </p><p>designated by the U.S. and UN last year - ref B.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  While we do not know the exact amount of frozen </p><p>assets, the designation has had serious consequences for the </p><p>Nasreddin family (father Ahmed Idris and sons Abdul Rahim and </p><p>Saleh), which has filed a lawsuit with the Danistay </p><p>(administrative court).  Kacar said they were deported by the </p><p>Ministry of Interior shortly after the November designation. </p><p>According to MFA Deputy Director General for Research Hakan </p><p>Okcal, NASCO\'s insurance company, Commercial Union Sigorta </p><p>As, has stopped insuring  and withheld two liability payments </p><p>-- one for $2,100 and a car damages claim for $4,000.  Okcal </p><p>said that officials were claiming they have been a </p><p>respectable, tax-paying Turkish company since 1987.  "They </p><p>are saying that because of the decree, their reputation has </p><p>been marred and they can\'t deal in the markets anymore," </p><p>Okcal said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) Kacar also complained that because the Finance </p><p>Ministry lacks specific evidence linking NASCO Nasreddin </p><p>Holding A.S. to terrorist financing, the Nasreddins may win </p><p>sympathy from the court and have its assets unfrozen.  Kacar </p><p>explained that in the case of Yasin al-Kadi, Turkish courts </p><p>found in favor of the GOT, not only because of the UN </p><p>designation but also because al-Kadi had fled the country. </p><p>Kacar said that in the Nasreddins\' case, absent specific </p><p>evidence, the court is more likely to rule in their favor. </p><p>(Ref B provides the background information associated with </p><p>the 14 entities in the Nada/Nasreddin Network.  Most of the </p><p>evidence of terrorist links points to Ahmed Idris Nasreddin </p><p>and Youssef Nada, who were directors of shell companies in </p><p>the Bahamas that have since been closed.  Many of the 14 </p><p>designees, including NASCO Nasreddin Holding A.S., are </p><p>affiliates of those shell companies.  However, ref B provides </p><p>scant direct evidence linking affiliates such as NASCO </p><p>Nasreddin Holding A.S. with terrorist financing.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) Finally, Kacar said that following GOT asset </p><p>freezing, designees such as al-Kadi and the Nasreddins are </p><p>now residing in the UK.  He has received this information </p><p>from the Nasreddins\' partners and from al-Kadi\'s lawyer.  He </p><p>also said that al-Kadi\'s lawyer has advised that Yasin </p><p>al-Kadi has upcoming plans to travel to the United States. </p><p>Kacar complained of a "double standard" in which the GOT </p><p>takes strong actions against terrorist financiers only to see </p><p>them live in comfort in another country.  He added that, over </p><p>the long-term, the GOT may eventually find it more difficult </p><p>to partake in asset freezing actions if it perceives a lack </p><p>of uniformity among allies in the war against terrorism. </p><p>(Kacar, however, did not have evidence that al-Kadi or the </p><p>Nasreddins were obtaining funds from designated entities in </p><p>the UK.  Furthermore, Econoff advised Kacar that the UN </p><p>resolution requiring asset seizure does not obligate </p><p>countries to deport associated individuals.) </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
