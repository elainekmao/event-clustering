<p>UNCLAS ROME 003213 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, IT, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: "BANANA PEEL POLITICS" IN ITALY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ROME 1462 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  IN AN EMBARRASSING, INDELICATE, AND </p><p>BADLY-TIMED SLIP, INTERIOR MINISTER SCAJOLA SEEMS TO HAVE </p><p>CALLED THE RECENTLY MURDERED LABOR MINISTRY ADVISER, MARCO </p><p>BIAGI, ROUGHLY A "PAIN IN THE ASS."  THE REACTION WAS </p><p>VINTAGE ITALIAN POLITICS -- OPPOSITION CALLS FOR HIS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03213  020647Z </p><p>RESIGNATION AND THREATENED NO-CONFIDENCE VOTES.  PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI REJECTED SCAJOLA\'S RESIGNATION, AND WE REMAIN </p><p>CONFIDENT THIS GOVERNMENT WILL SERVE ITS FIVE-YEAR TERM. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  ON JUNE 28, "LA REPUBLICA", A LEFT-LEANING DAILY, </p><p>PUBLISHED A SERIES OF LETTERS AND E-MAILS FROM MARCO BIAGI, </p><p>THE LABOR MINISTRY ADVISER MURDERED MARCH 19 IN BOLOGNA </p><p>(REF; BIAGI IS WIDELY PRESUMED TO HAVE BEEN MURDERED BY THE </p><p>"NEW RED BRIGADES").  BIAGI SENT THE COMMUNICATIONS TO </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES PIER FERDINANDO CASINI, </p><p>THE PREFECT (THE GOI\'S LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR, REPORTING TO THE </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTRY) OF BOLOGNA, A DIRECTOR OF CONFINDUSTRIA </p><p>(ITALY\'S LARGEST INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION), AND LABOR MINISTER </p><p>MARONI TO REQUEST REINSTATEMENT OF A POLICE ESCORT, SAYING </p><p>HE WAS IN FEAR OF HIS LIFE.  IN LIGHT OF HIS MURDER, HIS </p><p>CONCERNS TURN OUT TO HAVE BEEN NO EXAGGERATION.  IT IS </p><p>UNCLEAR WHAT PROMPTED "LA REPUBLICA" TO PRINT THE </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME; REFERENCE HAS BEEN </p><p>MADE TO THEIR EXISTENCE IN THE PAST. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  WHILE IN CYPRUS ON AN OFFICIAL VISIT, ITALY\'S </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTER, CLAUDIO SCAJOLA, WAS ASKED TO COMMENT ON </p><p>BIAGI\'S COMMUNICATIONS.  HE WAS QUOTED IN TWO CENTRIST </p><p>DAILIES, "CORRIERE DELLA SERA" AND "IL SOLE-24 ORE," AS </p><p>RESPONDING BY CALLING BIAGI SOMETHING ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO </p><p>A "PAIN IN THE ASS," AN EXPRESSION UNCHARACTERISTICALLY </p><p>VULGAR AND HARSH FOR THE NORMALLY-COMPOSED INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER.  HE REPORTEDLY ADDED THAT BIAGI ONLY SOUGHT TO GET </p><p>HIS CONTRACT EXTENDED AND THAT, HAD HE HAD AN ESCORT, THREE </p><p>PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED INSTEAD OF ONE.  HE HAS SINCE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03213  020647Z </p><p>SAID THAT HE "DID NOT RECOGNIZE" HIMSELF "IN THE REMARKS </p><p>ATTRIBUTED" TO HIM, BUT THE PREPONDERANCE OF INFORMATION </p><p>AVAILABLE SUGGESTS HE DID, INDEED, SAY SOMETHING HE SHOULD </p><p>NOT HAVE.  EVEN HIS FELLOW GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, LABOR </p><p>MINISTRY ROBERTO MARONI, URGED SCAJOLA TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS </p><p>REMARKS -- AND WAS NOT REBUKED BY PM BERLUSCONI FOR SO </p><p>DOING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  IN THE BROUHAHA FOLLOWING SCAJOLA\'S REPORTED </p><p>REMARKS, THE OPPOSITION UNSURPRISINGLY CALLED FOR HIS </p><p>RESIGNATION.  AFTER CONSULTING WITH DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER </p><p>FINI, AND PROBABLY OTHER GOVERNMENT MEMBERS AS WELL, </p><p>BERLUSCONI REJECTED SCAJOLA\'S RESIGNATION.  THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER HAS BEEN CALLED BY THE OPPOSITION TO EXPLAIN HIS </p><p>DECISION BEFORE PARLIAMENT; HIS APPEARANCE HAS YET TO BE </p><p>SCHEDULED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  AMIDST THE ACCUSATIONS AND COUNTER-ACCUSATIONS, </p><p>SEVERAL LEADERS, INCLUDING FINI AND CASINI, HAVE TRIED TO </p><p>CALM TENSIONS AND RECALL THE UNITY OF PURPOSE AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM REPORTED REF.  FINI EVEN REACHED OUT TO CGIL </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL COFFERATTI (THE ONLY UNION WHICH REFUSED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TO PARTICIPATE IN TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON LABOR </p><p>REFORM), TO WHOM BIAGI REFERRED IN HIS COMMUNICATIONS AS </p><p>"CONTRIBUTING TO HIS (BIAGI\'S) `CRIMINALIZATION.\'"   BIAGI </p><p>HAD WORRIED THAT COFFERATTI\'S RHETORIC AGAINST THE REFORMS </p><p>BIAGI WAS DRAFTING ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT SPARK </p><p>AN ATTACK.  HIS CONCERNS BECAME PUBLIC IN THIS RECENT </p><p>EPISODE.  ACKNOWLEDGING THAT "COFFERRATI IS TO BLAME FOR </p><p>CAUSING HARSH SOCIAL TENSIONS," FINI ADDED THAT "THIS SHOULD </p><p>NOT AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO `CRIMINALIZE\' HIM."  CASINI CALLED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03213  020647Z </p><p>ON HIS COLLEAGUES TO "STOP USING THESE BARBARIC METHODS OF </p><p>POLITICAL CONFRONTATION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  AS RESPECTED COMMENTATOR STEFANO FOLLI </p><p>WROTE IN "CORRIERE DELLA SERA," "MINISTER SCAJOLA SLIPPED ON </p><p>A BANANA PEEL."  FOLLI CONTINUED BY SAYING THIS COULD HAVE </p><p>"DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES" FOR THE GOVERNMENT IF NOT HANDLED </p><p>PROPERLY.  WE THINK THERE IS LITTLE DANGER OF THIS TASTELESS </p><p>AND ILL-TIMED REMARK BRINGING DOWN THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT; THEY STILL HAVE THE VOTES, EVEN IF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION CALLS FOR A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE.  WE ARE </p><p>REMINDED OF THE POLEMICS FOLLOWING LAST JULY\'S G-8 SUMMIT </p><p>AND THE OPPOSITION\'S EFFORTS TO BRING DOWN SCAJOLA, AT A </p><p>MINIMUM, IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT EPISODE.  WE PREDICT THAT, </p><p>IF ANYTHING, THIS EMBARRASSING AND TACKY EVENT WILL HAVE A </p><p>POSSIBLY SHORTER SHELF-LIFE.  WHETHER ITALY\'S PUBLIC </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES, GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION ALIKE, CAN REGAIN </p><p>THE HIGH ROAD THEY WALKED FOLLOWING BIAGI\'S MURDER IS </p><p>ANOTHER QUESTION, ESPECIALLY IN THE UPCOMING SUMMER NEWS </p><p>DOLDRUMS.  WE HOPE THEY CAN. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03213 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
