<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEL AVIV 017504 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SECRETARY, NEA AND SMEC </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND PARRIS </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS NATO COLLECTIVE, IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 11/05/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  RABIN ASSASSINATION:  NEXT STEPS IN ISRAEL\'S POLITICAL </p><p>          SUCCESSION </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  CLASSIFIED BY SECTION 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D).  NIACT PRECEDENCE BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT CRISIS IN </p><p>ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ACTING PRIME MINISTER SHIMON PERES WILL NEED TO </p><p>CONSIDER THREE POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 5 FUNERAL </p><p>FOR ASSASSINATED PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN.  PERES COULD ASK </p><p>PRESIDENT WEIZMAN TO RECOGNIZE THE EXISTING RULING COALITION; </p><p>FORM A NEW RULING COALITION; OR DISSOLVE THE KNESSET AND CALL </p><p>EARLY ELECTIONS.  NEW ELECTIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE 90 DAYS AFTER </p><p>THE 13TH KNESSET IS DISSOLVED.  POLITICAL AND PEACE PROCESS </p><p>FACTORS WILL OBVIOUSLY INFLUENCE ANY DECISION CONCERNING IF AND </p><p>WHEN NEW ELECTIONS ARE HELD.  OPPOSITION LEADER BINYAMIN </p><p>NETANYAHU TOLD US LAST NIGHT THAT LIKUD AND THE RIGHT WILL BE </p><p>DIRECTLY BLAMED FOR THE VIOLENCE LEADING TO THE ASSASSINATION OF </p><p>RABIN.  HE CALLED THE DEATH OF RABIN "A DISASTER FOR THE JEWISH </p><p>PEOPLE, A DISASTER FOR ISRAEL AND A DISASTER FOR THE RIGHT WHICH </p><p>WILL BE DECIMATED IF ELECTIONS ARE CALLED SOON." </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE NOVEMBER 4 ASSASSINATION OF PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN </p><p>HAS NO PRECEDENT IN ISRAEL\'S FORTY-SEVEN YEAR HISTORY.  LACKING A </p><p>CONSTITUTION, ISRAEL\'S BASIC LAW PROVIDES THAT A TEMPORARY ACTING </p><p>PRIME MINISTER BE NAMED BY THE ISRAELI CABINET.  IN EMERGENCY </p><p>SESSION LAST NIGHT, THE CABINET NAMED FOREIGN MINISTER SHIMON </p><p>PERES ACTING PRIME MINISTER, A DECISION TAKEN WITH THE </p><p>CONCURRENCE OF PRESIDENT EZER WEIZMAN. </p><p> </p><p>4. FOLLOWING A SEVEN-DAY MOURNING PERIOD (WHICH WILL RUN FROM THE </p><p>DAY OF BURIAL NOVEMBER 6 TO SUNDAY MORNING NOVEMBER 12), THE </p><p>ACTING PRIME MINISTER HAS THREE BASIC OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO </p><p>SUCCESSION: 1) CONTINUE WITH THE EXISTING RULING COALITION WITH </p><p>THE APPROVAL OF THE PRESIDENT, 2) FORM A NEW COALITION WITH THE </p><p>APPROVAL OF THE PRESIDENT, OR 3) CALL FOR NEW ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WE EXPECT ACTING PRIME MINISTER PERES TO CONSIDER HIS OPTIONS </p><p>AFTER THE NOVEMBER 6 FUNERAL FOR RABIN.  WE HAVE HEARD </p><p>PRELIMINARY REACTIONS FROM CABINET MEMBERS AND LABOR PARTY </p><p>LEADERS THAT PERES MAY WANT TO CALL FOR EARLY ELECTIONS.  ALREADY </p><p>THE LABOR PARTY HAS NAMED NAVA ARAD, A MEMBER OF THE 12TH KNESSET </p><p>AND AN ADVISOR TO THE PRIME MINISTER ON WOMEN\'S RIGHTS, TO </p><p>REPLACE RABIN\'S POSITION ON THE LABOR LIST AND RETAIN A PLURALITY </p><p>OF 44 SEATS IN THE KNESSET AND A WORKING MAJORITY OF 63.  WE HAVE </p><p>LEARNED FROM THE PRIME MINISTER\'S MILITARY ADVISOR, GENERAL DANNY </p><p>YATOM, THAT THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER WILL TAKE OVER THE DEFENSE </p><p>PORTFOLIO, SINCE PERES IS BARRED FROM NAMING NEW MINISTERS UNTIL </p><p>HE BECOMES PRIME MINISTER.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN THE NEAR </p><p>FUTURE EHUD BARAK, INTERIOR MINISTER AND FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF, </p><p>COULD BE NAMED DEFENSE MINISTER, A MOVE THAT MOST OF THE ISRAELI </p><p>PRESS HAS DISCUSSED IN TODAY\'S PAPERS.  BARAK IS CURRENTLY RACING </p><p>BACK TO ISRAEL FROM A U.S. VISIT TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF RABIN </p><p>TOMORROW. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IF PERES DECIDES TO CALL FOR NEW ELECTIONS, HE WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>DISSOLVE THE CURRENT 13TH SESSION OF THE KNESSET AND BEGIN A 90- </p><p>DAY ELECTION PERIOD DURING WHICH A CAMPAIGN WOULD BE CONDUCTED. </p><p>THE NEW ELECTION LAW PERMITTING THE DIRECT ELECTION OF THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER AND SEPARATE ELECTION OF KNESSET FACTIONS WILL TAKE </p><p>EFFECT.  SEVERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES STILL REMAIN UNRESOLVED AND </p><p>WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE AN ELECTION COULD BE HELD.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THE ISSUE OF A NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED, </p><p>SINCE LABOR AND LIKUD HAVE ALREADY AGREED THAT A SIMPLE KNESSET </p><p>MAJORITY WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO REMOVE A DIRECTLY-ELECTED PRIME </p><p>MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  POLITICAL AND PEACE PROCESS FACTORS NO DOUBT WILL GREATLY </p><p>INFLUENCE A DECISION BY ACTING PRIME MINISTER PERES ON WHETHER </p><p>AND WHEN TO CALL FOR NEW ELECTIONS.  SINCE OSLO II IS A </p><p>COMMITMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL, LABOR AND LIKUD SOURCES </p><p>TOLD US THAT REDEPLOYMENT WOULD CONTINUE DURING AN ELECTION </p><p>PERIOD.  LIKUD LEADER BINYAMIN NETANYAHU TOLD POLOFF LAST NIGHT </p><p>THAT THE ASSASSINATION OF RABIN IS A "DISASTER FOR THE JEWISH </p><p>PEOPLE, A DISASTER OF ISRAEL AND A DISASTER FOR THE RIGHT WHICH </p><p>WILL BE DECIMATED IF ELECTIONS ARE CALLED SOON."  OTHER LIKUD </p><p>SOURCES REFERRED IN A PANIC TO THE 1930\'S MURDER OF HAIM </p><p>ARLOSOROFF FOR WHICH THE ENTIRE REVISIONIST MOVEMENT WAS BLAMED </p><p>AND FEARED THE LEFT WILL DO THE SAME AGAIN WITH LIKUD AND THE </p><p>RIGHT IN 1995. </p><p> </p><p>INDYK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: NOT PASSED TO ABOVE ADDRESSEE(S) </p><p></p></div>
