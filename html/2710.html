<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000672 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: PM DEUBA FACES DOWN MOUNTING OPPOSITION, CRITICISM </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 0485 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Ever-present rumors that former Prime Minister and </p><p>ruling Nepali Congress Party President Girija Prasad Koirala </p><p>continues to plot the political downfall of sitting PM Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba have increased in virulence after a three-day </p><p>Opposition boycott of Parliament and multi-partisan </p><p>discontent at Deuba\'s perceived failures, including an </p><p>inability to control the Royal Nepal Army (RNA).  While there </p><p>is doubtless some truth in such criticisms--especially those </p><p>citing the PM\'s inability to provide a new vision since the </p><p>collapse of dialogue with the Maoists November 23--the real </p><p>reason has more to do with Koirala\'s continued efforts to </p><p>undermine his long-time political rival\'s position and with </p><p>others smelling the blood in the water.  The PM appears to </p><p>have faced down the immediate threat for now, but absent an </p><p>appreciable improvement in the security situation, we expect </p><p>the "Dump Deuba" drumbeat to continue.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>THE AXE ABOVE DEUBA\'S HEAD </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ever-present rumors that former Prime Minister and </p><p>ruling Nepali Congress Party President Girija Prasad Koirala </p><p>continues to plot the political downfall of sitting PM Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba have increased in virulence.  Members of the </p><p>Nepali Congress, including some not habitually associated </p><p>with the Koirala camp, have assured us on several recent </p><p>occasions that they have sufficient support to win a vote of </p><p>no confidence against Deuba in Parliament.  Govinda Raj </p><p>Joshi, a former Home Minister and long-time Koirala stalwart, </p><p>told poloff Opposition Members of Parliament, including the </p><p>small, left-wing National People\'s Front and United People\'s </p><p>Front, have expressed dissatisfaction with Deuba and asked </p><p>the ruling party to bring a vote of no confidence to oust </p><p>him.  Joshi also claimed that a majority of district party </p><p>presidents, in Kathmandu for an April 1 meeting, complained </p><p>of the continued lack of security confronting them in </p><p>outlying areas, said they felt abandoned by the present </p><p>government, and made a similar request.  Arjun Narasingh </p><p>K.C., Nepali Congress Party Spokesman, confirmed to the </p><p>Ambassador discussion of such a plan, but stressed that he </p><p>and others in the party were trying to convince Koirala to </p><p>hold off until after the state of emergency runs out at the </p><p>end of May.  Chin Kaji Shrestha, a former NC MP from Gorkha, </p><p>also asserted that enough pro-Koirala votes were already </p><p>lined up to dump Deuba. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On March 27 members of the local NGO Human Rights </p><p>Organization of Nepal (HURON) told poloff that the Koirala </p><p>camp had already secured the tacit support of the main </p><p>Opposition party, the Communist Party of Nepal - United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (UML) and the third largest party, the </p><p>Rastriya Prajatantra Pakshye (RPP) to dump Deuba.  They </p><p>alleged RPP President and former PM Surya Bahadur Thapa had </p><p>confirmed the planned move to them.  (Note:  No one in either </p><p>the UML or RPP has confirmed such a plan to us.  Indeed, RPP </p><p>MP Pashupati Rana told the Ambassador that he saw no </p><p>realistic alternative to Deuba as PM.  End note.)   According </p><p>to HURON, the Opposition parties believe that Deuba is unable </p><p>to exercise effective control over the RNA and are </p><p>increasingly unhappy with the Army\'s performance in outlying </p><p>districts--including alleged harassment of their </p><p>activists--during the state of emergency.  Bharat Man </p><p>Adhikari, a UML MP, while not explicitly confirming that his </p><p>party had been approached by Koirala, said he understood some </p><p>NC MPs were collecting signatures against Deuba.  He noted to </p><p>poloff the UML\'s concern at the perceived lack of civilian </p><p>control over the RNA.  The way the Constitution is written, </p><p>the RNA\'s primary allegiance is to the King, Adhikari </p><p>concluded, and not to the Parliamentary democracy.  (Note: </p><p>RNA officers\' formal oath is also to the King.  End note.) </p><p>In general, he faulted Deuba for failing to come up with </p><p>workable  socio-economic programs to address the grievances </p><p>of the poor.  A journalist echoed some of these criticisms in </p><p>private, saying Deuba seems to lack the vision for a </p><p>comprehensive program to lead Nepal into a better future. </p><p>Policy-making is ad hoc at best and non-existent at worst. </p><p>The continued lack of civilian government presence in </p><p>Maoist-affected districts has also hurt Deuba, the journalist </p><p>observed, underiming critical support among the beleaguered </p><p>district party chairmen in these embattled outposts. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>RANA REMARKS RANKLE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  A March 27 speech given by Chief of Army Staff </p><p>(COAS) Gen. Prajwalla SJB Rana to graduates of the command </p><p>and staff training college in Kathmandu apparently only </p><p>aggravated some politicians\' displeasure with the military </p><p>leadership.  In his comments, which received wide coverage in </p><p>the local media, Rana castigated politicians of all parties </p><p>for what he viewed as their failure to provide adequate </p><p>democratic leadership.  According to translated excerpts from </p><p>his speech, Rana demanded, "Who brought the nation to its </p><p>present condition?  Is this the creation of bad governance, </p><p>or is it something the army has done?  . . . In a country </p><p>where there is a democracy, elected people\'s representatives </p><p>and an elected majority government, can the state of </p><p>emergency be declared just because the army wants it? . . Is </p><p>it right to blame the Royal Nepalese Army, the protector of </p><p>national security, for a situation which is the result of 12 </p><p>years of political factors?"  Stating that the RNA is </p><p>fulfilling its duties in protecting the country, Rana </p><p>questioned why representatives from Maoist-affected areas </p><p>were not visiting their constituencies, and criticized them </p><p>for "not helping the security forces in the campaign against </p><p>terrorists in their constituencies." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Rana went on to lambaste politicians for playing </p><p>"selfish games of factional dominance" at a time of national </p><p>crisis.  Only the Prime Minister and some of the younger </p><p>ministers give the RNA the support it needs, Rana charged. </p><p>Acknowledging that "there may have been some lapses on our </p><p>side," Rana maintained that in general the RNA was sensitive </p><p>to the need "that innocent people should not suffer any </p><p>losses."  Addressing members of the media, he appealed to </p><p>them "to ensure a sense of security to all citizens" and </p><p>"help raise the morale of the army."  "False" and/or </p><p>"confusing" news items might have "a negative impact on the </p><p>trust and confidence that we have earned from the Nepali </p><p>people," he warned, concluding that "in this time of crisis </p><p>it is necessary to keep our differences on hold."   (Note: </p><p>Two journalists, whose cases had attracted wide and generally </p><p>unfavorable coverage, had just been released from RNA custody </p><p>the previous day.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>BOYCOTTS R US: OPPOSITION WALKS OUT OF PARLIAMENT; </p><p>SHUNS ALL-PARTY MEETING CALLED BY DEUBA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Many perceived Rana\'s speech as a direct slap at </p><p>Koirala, who was PM for many of the 12 years of Nepal\'s </p><p>democracy.  Rana was also likely responding in part to </p><p>ongoing, increasingly public criticism from Opposition </p><p>parties and the pro-Koirala faction of the Nepali Congress </p><p>Party of the RNA\'s performance under the emergency thus far. </p><p>On March 25 and 26 the five MPs from the far left-wing </p><p>National People\'s Front walked out of Parliament in protest </p><p>of the March 14 killings of three of their party activists </p><p>after their arrests by the RNA in a jungle in Argal, Baglung </p><p>District.  (Note:  The official Ministry of Defense press </p><p>release described the dead men as Maoists.  End note.)  Other </p><p>Opposition MPs accused the RNA of committing "excesses" under </p><p>the emergency, including extra-judicial killings of civilians </p><p>wrongly suspected of being Maoists.  Following Rana\'s </p><p>remarks, Opposition MPs staged a three-day boycott of </p><p>Parliament March 28-30, demanding Deuba, as Minister of </p><p>Defense, seek clarification from the Army Chief.  Also at </p><p>issue, according to several Opposition MPs, were Deuba\'s lack </p><p>of progress on his promise to review proposals for </p><p>constitutional amendments (Ref A) and the GON\'s failure to </p><p>exempt mainstream political parties\' meetings from the ban on </p><p>public assemblies during the emergency.  Opposition parties </p><p>also boycotted an all-party meeting called by Deuba March 27 </p><p>to discuss both the upcoming April 2-6 general strike called </p><p>by the Maoists and proposed constitutional amendments. </p><p>Before walking out March 29, Opposition MPs (along with some </p><p>in the Nepali Congress) took turns denouncing COAS Rana for </p><p>his remarks and PM Deuba for not denouncing Rana.  (The PM </p><p>was not in Parliament to hear these sentiments; he was </p><p>traveling in the Western region with the King and the </p><p>controversial Army Chief, giving rise to the inevitable </p><p>conclusion among some, including in the NC, that a </p><p>"conspiracy" was afoot.)  Opposition Leader Madhav Nepal was </p><p>particularly incensed, describing Deuba as no more than a </p><p>"robot" running "a puppet government." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  On March 31 Koirala called an all-party meeting at </p><p>the NC central office, which, in contrast to the March 27 </p><p>meeting called by Deuba, the Opposition attended. The put-out </p><p>party leaders agreed to demand an explanation from Rana, via </p><p>the PM, of his "objectionable" remarks, but stopped short of </p><p>calling for Deuba\'s resignation. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>DEUBA "CAUTIONS" ARMY CHIEF; </p><p>CALMS MIFFED MPS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  After his return from the West, on April 1 the PM </p><p>issued a statement "cautioning" the Army Chief to remember </p><p>that "the Royal Nepal Army is a non-political body" and </p><p>should stay out of politics.  At the same time, Deuba </p><p>commended the RNA for its efforts to support and defend </p><p>multi-party democracy, which he described as under siege from </p><p>the Maoists.  The PM also issued the desired directives </p><p>allowing political party meetings and sent them to the King </p><p>for approval.  On the same day, Rana appeared before </p><p>indignant members of the State Affairs Committee in </p><p>Parliament for three hours to explain himself.  Lawmakers </p><p>emerged from that session mollified, with one reporting that </p><p>Rana had said his comments were misunderstood. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  RPP MP Pashupati Rana told Ambassador April 3 that </p><p>Deuba had cleverly worked out a compromise, with clearance </p><p>from the King, between the Army Chief and the Opposition </p><p>Leader on the language of the statement.  The Nepali word for </p><p>"caution" carries a somewhat stronger connotation than in </p><p>English so that the MPs read Deuba\'s comparatively anodyne </p><p>statement on the Army Chief\'s comments as a rebuke.  The </p><p>RPP\'s Rana sees Deuba\'s hand as now strengthened by his </p><p>ability to emerge unscathed from the contretemps.  For now, </p><p>the seething controversy sparked by the Army Chief\'s remarks, </p><p>which had managed to push the looming, potentially disastrous </p><p>five-day Maoist strike completely out of the headlines, has </p><p>rapidly fizzled out. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Koirala may criticize Deuba\'s failure to exert </p><p>control over the RNA, but his own abysmal relations with the </p><p>RNA during his last tenure as PM helped contribute to his </p><p>eventual decision to resign.  The Army would be unlikely to </p><p>welcome Koirala back as PM--which not-too subtle message the </p><p>Army Chief may have been trying to convey in his public </p><p>comments.  Rana has come under increasing heat in recent days </p><p>for alleged excesses by the RNA in the field; his remarks may </p><p>also have been intended in part to deflect some of that.  But </p><p>some of his criticisms--especially about the chronic lack of </p><p>political unity at times of national crisis--are right on </p><p>target, as was so aptly demonstrated by the MPs\' histrionic, </p><p>self-absorbed over-reaction that preoccupied Parliamentary </p><p>proceedings to the exclusion of other pressing issues, such </p><p>as the impending Maoist strike, that threaten the nation.  At </p><p>the same time, some of the growing criticisms of Deuba, such </p><p>as his all-too apparent lack of vision on how to address </p><p>long-standing socio-economic grievances the Maoists play </p><p>upon, also have some truth.  The real reason behind any move </p><p>to dump Deuba, however, likely has more to do with Koirala\'s </p><p>habitual efforts to come back into power--and with </p><p>opportunists in the Opposition and the ruling party smelling </p><p>the blood in the water-- than with any particular </p><p>dissatisfaction with Deuba.  For now, Deuba appears to have </p><p>dodged this bullet, but Koirala can be counted on, as always, </p><p>to keep trying. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
