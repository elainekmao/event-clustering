<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000220 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  MORE SENTENCES FOR PUBLIC PROTESTS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  FBIS JPP20030113000060  B.  HANOI 031 </p><p>-     C.  02 Hanoi 2713           D.  Hanoi 0175 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  An official of the Nam Dinh Provincial People\'s </p><p>Court confirmed to emboff on January 28 the substance of </p><p>media reports (ref a) about the sentencing on December 18 of </p><p>ten people involved in public protests in Hong Thuan commune </p><p>of Giao Thuy district in that province.  He also confirmed </p><p>that sentences ranged between eighteen months and five </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  According to the official, protests over local </p><p>corruption and agricultural land use taxes dated back at </p><p>least to June 2000, when some local residents -- including </p><p>local Communist Party officials -- first allegedly </p><p>"sabotaged" official meetings set up to handle public </p><p>complaints.  Some residents also apparently "illegally </p><p>detained" the local chief of personnel and chief of the </p><p>district office for up to a week.  Other local residents </p><p>then tried to "sabotage" May 2002 National Assembly </p><p>elections, he claimed. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The court official noted that local and provincial </p><p>officials had attempted to resolve complaints by "firing" or </p><p>transferring some of the officials accused of corruption, </p><p>but local residents continued to "cause public disorder" by </p><p>attempting to hand deliver complaints to more senior CPV and </p><p>GVN officials.  The organizers were arrested in May 2002, he </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Minister of Government Office Doan Manh Giao told </p><p>the press on January 11 that the GVN would soon issue a new </p><p>decree to deal with citizens "abusing democracy" to "cause </p><p>social unrest" or "undermine social stability."  He </p><p>predicted, however, that it would take a "long time" to </p><p>draft a law on "this sensitive issue" and noted that the </p><p>eventual decree would not only "stipulate what, how and </p><p>where demonstrators are allowed to protest" but also provide </p><p>clearer fines and punishment.  He admitted the "more and </p><p>more people" were using complaints and petitions to incite </p><p>people to protest. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Comment:  Similar to protests over land use and </p><p>local corruption that have led to a string of sentences in </p><p>near-by Hatay province (refs b and c), the Nam Dinh case </p><p>again demonstrates both local ire over incompetent and/or </p><p>corrupt officials as well as the continued sensitivity of </p><p>land issues, both of which were major themes of the most </p><p>recent CPV Central Committee plenum (ref d).   The protests </p><p>are also clear indications that the law on denunciations and </p><p>complaints is not working very well (the 2002 revised </p><p>version may help improve this process eventually -- septel), </p><p>that Vietnamese are still willing to take their complaints </p><p>on some issues to the street, and that the GVN will react </p><p>strongly against perceived "agitators" who "threaten" public </p><p>order. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
