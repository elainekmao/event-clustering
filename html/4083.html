WFP\'S EMOP REPORTS THAT INCREASED HOSTILITY </p><p>TOWARDS FOREIGNERS IN COTE D\'IVOIRE HAS CAUSED 3,300 </p><p>PERSONS TO CROSS INTO MALI, 1,000 INTO BURKINA FASO, </p><p>1,500 INTO GHANA, 400 INTO LIBERIA, AND 200 INTO </p><p>NIGER.

WFP IS QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT THE REGIONAL IMPACT </p><p>OF A WIDENING CRISIS IN COTE D\'IVOIRE, ESPECIALLY </p><p>GIVEN THE GROWING PROBLEMS OF DROUGHT IN THE SAHEL. </p><p>ABIDJAN SERVES AS THE PORT OF ENTRY FOR MANY OF THE </p><p>SAHEL COUNTRIES.  HIGH PRICES FOR BASIC CEREALS </p><p>CAUSED BY THE DROUGHT WILL BE FURTHER EXACERBATED BY </p><p>TRANSPORT BLOCKAGES.  CONVERSELY, EXPORTS FROM THE </p><p>SAHEL THAT TRADITIONALLY TRANSIT THROUGH ABIDJAN HAVE </p><p>ALREADY SLOWED OR STOPPED.  LASTLY, MANY PEOPLE IN </p><p>THE SAHEL COUNTRIES RELY ON REMITTANCES FROM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05236  02 OF 04  251424Z </p><p>RELATIVES IN COTE D\'IVOIRE.  IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE </p><p>THAT REMITTANCE FLOWS WILL SUBSTANTIALLY DIMINISH, </p><p>THEREBY ADDING TO THE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF COTE </p><p>D\'IVOIRE\'S NEIGHBORS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>ADDRESSING CURRENT NEEDS AND PREPARING FOR THE WORST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  WFP\'S REGIONAL EMOP IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION </p><p>THAT THE CURRENT POLITICAL STALEMATE WILL CONTINUE </p><p>WITH THE DE FACTO PARTITION REMAINING (I.E. THE </p><p>REBELS NOW CONTROL THE NORTHERN REGION, ROUGHLY HALF </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY). IT IS EXPECTED THAT THIS WILL </p><p>ENGENDER CONTINUED POPULATION DISPLACEMENT BOTH </p><p>INSIDE COTE D\'IVOIRE AND OUTFLOWS TO BURKINA FASO, </p><p>MALI, GHANA, AND LIBERIA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ALTHOUGH WFP AND ITS U.N. AGENCY PARTNERS ARE </p><p>HOPING FOR A POSITIVE OUTCOME TO THE CRISIS, WFP IS </p><p>TAKING A REALISTIC LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES FOR </p><p>FURTHER DETERIORATION AND THE IMPACT AS PART OF ITS </p><p>CONTINGENCY READINESS.  EVEN SO, IF THERE ARE SWIFT, </p><p>MASSIVE MOVEMENTS ACROSS BORDERS, NO AGENCY WILL BE </p><p>PREPARED OVERNIGHT TO RESPOND, BUT VICE SPENDING A </p><p>LOT OF MONEY ON ESTABLISHING RESPONSE MECHANISMS THAT </p><p>MAY NOT BE NEEDED, WFP IS TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS </p><p>NOW TO REVIEW WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RESPOND AS </p><p>QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05236  02 OF 04  251424Z </p><p>CRISIS SUPPORT UNIT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  WFP\'S CURRENT COTE D\'IVOIRE COUNTRY DIRECTOR </p><p>LEAVES ABIDJAN SUNDAY, OCTOBER 27, DUE TO UNSECORD\'S </p><p>DECISION TO PASS ABIDJAN TO PHASE III SECURITY WHICH </p><p>ALLOWS NO DEPENDENTS.  TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE AND </p><p>EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF WFP\'S REGIONAL EMOP, WFP </p><p>IS ESTABLISHING A CRISIS SUPPORT UNIT IN ABIDJAN. </p><p>BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRIES SURROUNDING </p><p>COTE D\'IVOIRE ARE COUNTRIES WITH DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS </p><p>RATHER THAN EMERGENCIES, NO STRUCTURE NOR TRADITION </p><p>OF EMERGENCY OPERATIONS EXISTS.
