<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002618 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>   1.  Under headline "Iraq: U.S. war drums continue" </p><p>       the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" </p><p>       dedicated its November 17 editorial to accusing </p><p>       the United States of itching for a military </p><p>       showdown against Iraq irrespective of Iraq\'s </p><p>       acceptance of United Nations inspectors.  "If </p><p>       Iraq so much as denies any accusation leveled </p><p>       against it from now onwards, the U.S. could use </p><p>       military action," the editorial declares. </p><p>       Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>   2.  "The United States and Britain continue their </p><p>       preparations for the invasion of Iraq despite </p><p>       the fact that Iraq has accepted the UN </p><p>       resolution for disarmament.  The U.S. </p><p>       President, George Bush, has vowed to topple </p><p>       Iraq President Saddam Hussein by military force </p><p>       and the much-awaited invasion is supposed to </p><p>       achieve just that.  So that, Iraq\'s acceptance </p><p>       of UN inspectors rather than being welcome, is </p><p>       perceived in Washington as a move calculated to </p><p>    delay the military action. . .  On the other </p><p>    hand, the U.S. will be looking for the </p><p>    slightest excuse to launch an attack on Iraq. </p><p>    Asked about his understanding of the UN </p><p>    conditions on Iraq, George Bush said, "Zero </p><p>    tolerance. . .we will not tolerate any </p><p>    deception, denial or deceit, period.\'  That </p><p>    means, if Iraq so much as denies any accusation </p><p>    leveled against it from now onwards, the U.S. </p><p>    could use military action.  And, as the U.S. </p><p>    Secretary of State Colin Powell put it, such </p><p>    military action would have the objective "to </p><p>    disarm (Iraq) through changing the regime.\' </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
