<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HAVANA 06415 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CU </p><p>SUBJECT: ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 355397 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THIS CABLE RESPONDS TO THE QUESTIONS RAISED IN </p><p>REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DESCRIBE ANY HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS </p><p>INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT </p><p>ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>THE ONLY OSTENSIBLE PROSECUTION OF TERRORIST ACTS IN </p><p>1990 WAS THE JULY 16 TRIAL OF 11 MEMBERS OF A GROUP </p><p>KNOWN AS THE YOUTH ASSOCIATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>ACCUSED OF CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS, </p><p>INCLUDING PLANS TO DYNAMITE THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, </p><p>PLANS TO STEAL ARMS BY FORCE FROM A MILITARY UNIT, TO </p><p>PLANT A CAR BOMB AND TO OCCUPY A FOREIGN EMBASSY.  THE </p><p>TRIAL WAS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, BUT WAS NOT ATTENDED BY </p><p>WESTERN OBSERVERS.  NO INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO </p><p>JUDGE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>CHARGES.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS THE TERRORISTS </p><p>WERE FOUND WITH 900 GRAMS OF TNT, ELECTRIC DETONATORS </p><p>AND 7.62 MM SHELLS.  THE GROUP WAS FALSELY ACCUSED OF </p><p>LINKS WITH THE U.S. INTERESTS SECTION IN HAVANA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORIST FOR PROSECUTION? </p><p> </p><p>CUBA DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH REQUEST IN 1990.  HOWEVER, </p><p>IT HAD REQUESTED EXTRADITION OF ORLANDO BOSCH FROM </p><p>VENEZUELA WHILE HE WAS HELD THERE.  ALTHOUGH NO </p><p>EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES EXISTS, THE </p><p>OFFICIAL CUBAN PRESS MADE IT CLEAR THAT CUBA WANTED </p><p>THE UNITED STATES TO RETURN ORLANDO BOSCH TO CUBA TO </p><p>FACE CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE 1976 BOMBING OF A </p><p>CUBANA COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH </p><p>OF ALL ON BOARD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN </p><p>PROSECUTION: </p><p> </p><p>CUBAN PUBLIC STATEMENTS HAVE CONDEMNED THE KILLING OF </p><p>CIVILIANS BY GOVERNMENT AND IRREGULAR FORCES OR DEATH </p><p>SQUADS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, </p><p>NICARAGUA AND COLOMBIA.  THE CONDEMNATION UNIFORMLY </p><p>FOLLOWED POLITICAL LINES.  THAT IS, OFFICIAL </p><p>STATEMENTS CONDEMNED CLAIMED PRE-MEDITATED KILLING OF </p><p>CIVILIANS WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN BY GROUPS OR </p><p>INDIVIDUALS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA DID NOT CONDEMN TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>APPARENTLY COMMITTED BY IRREGULAR FORCES OR </p><p>GOVERNMENTS SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF CUBA DID NOT MAKE ANY EFFORT TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE OR ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  DESCRIBE MAJOR CONTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN </p><p>IN 1990 BY THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN </p><p>IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>NO MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS WERE UNDERTAKEN. </p><p>CUBA MAINTAINS A LARGE POLICE/STATE SECURITY APPARATUS </p><p>WHICH EFFECTIVELY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISM TO PROSPER.  EXTENSIVE SOCIAL CONTROL AND </p><p>STATE INTRUSION INTO NEARLY ALL ASPECTS OF PRIVATE </p><p>LIFE MAKE IT VERY LIKELY THAT NASCENT TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE DISCOVERED OR NECESSARILY REMAIN </p><p>SO SMALL AND INSULAR THAT THEY WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, INCLUDING POLITICAL AND </p><p>FINANCIAL  SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT </p><p>THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION, MISUSE OF THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC POUCH, AND OTHER PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT </p><p>TERRORISM; SANCTUARY EXTENDED TO TERRORISTS OR </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS AND/OR THE PRESENCE OF OFFICE OF SUCH </p><p>GROUPS; HOST GOVERNMENT TRAINING OR THE PROVISION OF </p><p>TRAINING SITES TO TERRORIST GROUPS; AND POSITIONS </p><p>TAKEN ON TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOC POLITICALLY SUPPORTS OR SUPPORTED FARABUNDO </p><p>MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, THE GUATEMALAN </p><p>NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, THE POLITICAL ARM OF THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES, THE FORMER 19TH </p><p>OF APRIL MOVEMENT, THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS, THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN LIBERATION ORGANIZATION.  CUBAN MAINTAINS </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH "THE STATE OF PALESTINE", </p><p>AND RECOGNIZES THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS AS A </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT.  IT ALSO RECOGNIZED THE </p><p>SOUTHWEST AFRICAN PEOPLES ORGANIZATION (SWAPO) AS A </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT BEFORE NAMIBIAN </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  CUBA SUPPLIED MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>SWAPO, THE FMLN, THE M-19, AND PROBABLY THE FARC. </p><p>CUBA IS WIDELY THOUGHT TO CONTINUE ARMS AND OTHER </p><p>MILITARY SUPPORT TO THE FMLN. </p><p> </p><p>8.  HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS </p><p>IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST SULPORTING COUNTRY ON A </p><p>TERRORISM ISSUE? </p><p> </p><p>CUBA OPENLY SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENTS OF IRAN, IRAQ, </p><p>LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, AND SYRIA.  IT DOES NOT OPENLY </p><p>SUPPORT TERRORISM, WHICH IT DISTINGUISHES, ALONG </p><p>POLITICAL LINES, FROM NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1989, </p><p>POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC. </p><p>WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? </p><p> </p><p>CUBA CONTINUED TO WITHDRAW ITS TROOPS FROM SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA ACCORDING TO SCHEDULE.  TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>OR NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS SUPPORTED POLITICALLY </p><p>AND PERHAPS MILITARILY BY CUBA HAVE BEEN LESS ACTIVE </p><p>IN 1990 THAN IN 1989, EXCEPT THE FMLN IN EL SALVADOR, </p><p>AND PERHAPS THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>UNITY. </p><p> </p><p>FLANIGAN </p><p></p></div>
