<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002914 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA, AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREAUSRY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EINV, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AK REVIVES PLANS TO SELL STATE LANDS, </p><p>IN SEARCH OF NEW REVENUE SOURCES </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET </p><p>DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  PM ERDOGAN ANNOUNCED RECENTLY THAT </p><p>THE GOT IS PLANNING TO REALIZE BETWEEN $25-30 BILLION </p><p>IN NEW REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF STATE-OWNED "FOREST </p><p>LAND," MUCH OF IT TREELESS SUBURBAN SQUATTER </p><p>SETTLEMENTS.  THE OPPOSITION CHP AND SEVERAL NGOS </p><p>CRITICIZED THE PROPOSAL, AND PRESIDENT SEZER HAS VETOED </p><p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SALE. </p><p>THE GOT PLANS TO PUT IT THROUGH PARLIAMENT A SECOND </p><p>TIME, AND IS ALSO PLANNING TO SELL OTHER, NON-FOREST </p><p>STATE LAND (WHICH WON\'T REQUIRE A CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>AMENDMENT.)   MANY DEVELOPMENT ECONOMISTS PROMOTE </p><p>LEGALIZING SQUATTERS\' OWNERSHIP OF STATE LAND AS A WAY </p><p>OF GETTING POOR PEOPLE ACCESS TO CAPITAL, AND THE </p><p>PROJECT WILL ALSO HELP TO REGULARIZE LAND OWNERSHIP. </p><p>HOWEVER, GOT CLAIMS THAT THESE SALES WILL SOLVE ITS </p><p>SHORT-TERM BUDGET FINANCING PROBLEMS ARE UNREALISTIC. </p><p>CYNICAL OBSERVORS, AND THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION, SEE IT </p><p>AS SIMPLY A WAY OF REWARDING REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER </p><p>CRONIES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) PRIME MINISTER TAYYIP ERDOGAN AND FORESTRY </p><p>MINISTER OSMAN PEPE HAVE RECENTLY REVIVED LONG-STANDING </p><p>PLANS TO SELL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF STATE-OWNED </p><p>LAND CATEGORIZED AS "FOREST LAND" (MUCH OF IT </p><p>TREELESS).   PM ERDOGAN HAS SAID THE PLAN IS TO SELL </p><p>SUBURBAN "FOREST LAND" TO CURRENT SQUATTER RESIDENTS, </p><p>AND THAT THE GOT EXPECTS $25 - 30 BILLION IN REVENUE </p><p>FROM SUCH SALES.  MINISTER PEPE CLAIMED DURING A SPEECH </p><p>TO PARLIAMENT APRIL 1 THAT SUCH PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF "FOREST LAND" WOULD </p><p>HELP DEVELOP FORESTS.  THE GOT PLANS TO SPEND 20% OF </p><p>THE REVENUE IT RECEIVES FROM THIS SALE ON IMPROVING THE </p><p>CONDITIONS IN SQUATTER COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) SUCH A PLAN WOULD HELP REGULARIZE TURKEY\'S </p><p>INCOMPLETE LAND REGISTRY SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY CHP AND SEVERAL NGOS CRITICIZED THIS </p><p>ATTEMPT TO SELL THE "FOREST" AREAS.  MOST OF THE </p><p>CRITICISM FOCUSED ON THE DEFINITION OF "FOREST" AND THE </p><p>LACK OF CLARITY REGARDING THE POTENTIAL BUYERS OF THESE </p><p>LANDS.  BEHIND THIS TECHNICAL CRITICISM LIES THE </p><p>SUSPICION THAT THIS AKP INITIATIVE IS INTENDED TO </p><p>PROVIDE PARTY SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING REAL ESTATE </p><p>DEVELOPERS, WITH CHEAP (NEARLY FREE) LAND.  THE </p><p>OPPOSING PARTIES ALSO CLAIMED THAT THE GOT\'S REVENUE </p><p>TARGET FROM THESE LANDS WAS EXAGGERATED, AND ANY </p><p>SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SUCH SALES WOULD ONLY BE </p><p>REALIZED OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) TURKEY\'S CONSTITUTION POSES ANOTHER HURDLE TO </p><p>THIS PLAN.  ARTICLE 169 STATES THAT "STATE FORESTS ARE </p><p>MANAGED AND EXPLOITED BY THE STATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>THE LAW."  THUS THE PROJECT TO SELL FOREST LAND </p><p>REQUIRES A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ENABLE THE GOT </p><p>TO LEASE, SELL OR TRANSFER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS OF THESE </p><p>AREAS.  THE GOT PUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY VOTE ON APR 4, 2003, BUT NARROWLY FAILED </p><p>TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY TWO THIRDS MAJORITY.  THE GOT </p><p>PLANS A SECOND PARLIAMENTARY VOTE ON THE PROPOSAL SOON, </p><p>ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) THE AK GOVERNMENT IS ALSO PLANNING TO SELL </p><p>OTHER STATE LAND THAT IS NOT CATEGORIZED AS "FOREST </p><p>AREAS."  SUCH "NON-FOREST" STATE LAND COULD BE SOLD </p><p>WITHOUT AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION, AND A DRAFT COUNCIL </p><p>OF MINISTERS DECREE AUTHORIZING SUCH SALES IS CURRENTLY </p><p>CIRCULATING FOR SIGNATURE.  REFERRING TO THIS DRAFT </p><p>CABINET DECREE, GOT SPOKESMAN CICEK RECENTLY ANNOUNCED </p><p>A "SQUATTERS PEACE," THROUGH WHICH THE GOT WILL SELL </p><p>NON-FOREST STATE LANDS TO THEIR EXISTING UNOFFICIAL </p><p>RESIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT: LEGALIZING SQUATTER FAMILIES\' </p><p>OWNERSHIP OF STATE LAND IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA. </p><p>PERUVIAN ECONOMIST HERNANDO DE SOTO SEES THIS AS A STEP </p><p>TOWARDS GIVING POOR PEOPLE IN UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES </p><p>ACCESS TO CAPITAL (SINCE THEY CAN BORROW AGAINST LAND </p><p>THEY LEGALLY OWN).  BUT SUCCESSIVE TURKISH GOVERNMENTS </p><p>HAVE TREATED THE IDEA AS A MAGIC SOLUTION TO THE GOT\'S </p><p>BUDGET FINANCING PROBLEMS (ANOTHER SUCH PHANTOM </p><p>SOLUTION IS PM ERDOGAN\'S CALL FOR EACH CITIZEN TO </p><p>DONATE $100 TO THE GOT.)  IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE </p><p>SQUATTERS PAYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE STATE FOR </p><p>THIS LAND.   CYNICS HERE BELIEVE THE PROJECT IS MOSTLY </p><p>ABOUT GIVING SWEET DEALS TO REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER </p><p>CRONIES, AND ONLY COLLATERALLY HELPING AK CONSTITUENTS </p><p>IN THE SUBURBAN SQUATTER SETTLEMENTS. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
