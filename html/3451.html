<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003849 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, IT, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S SUPPORT FOR ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>CONSTRAINED BY PUBLIC OPINION </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 3796 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03849  060939Z </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  AT AN AUGUST 5 WORKING LUNCH WITH U/S JOHN BOLTON AND </p><p>EMBASSY, MFA AND MOD OFFICIALS ON THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL </p><p>COURT (ICC) AND OTHER ISSUES (REPORTED SEPTEL), MFA DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL GIANCARLO ARAGONO REITERATED ITALY\'S WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>ASSIST THE US WITH EFFORTS TO SIGN AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>BUT ADDED THAT ITALIAN PUBLIC AND PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE ICC WOULD LIMIT THE EXTENT OF GOI SUPPORT.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE EU CONSULTATIVE PROCESS NOW UNDERWAY IS NOT GOING IN THE </p><p>USG\'S FAVOR, IN PART BECAUSE SEVERAL COUNTRIES NEED TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE TO THEIR PUBLICS AN UNYIELDING SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>COURT.  ARAGONA ASSURED U/S BOLTON THAT THE GOI IS WORKING </p><p>WITHIN EU DISCUSSIONS TO ENSURE AN OUTCOME FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO </p><p>ACOMMODATE THE USG REQUEST FOR ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS.  ONCE </p><p>EU CONSULTATIONS HAVE FINISHED, PROBABLY BY THE END OF THE </p><p>MONTH, ITALY WILL BE ABLE TO DECIDE HOW BEST TO ACT </p><p>BILATERALLY, ARAGONA SAID. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) U/S BOLTON EXPLAINED THAT A RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT WOULD </p><p>PRESERVE WHAT ITALY ALREADY HAS AS A STATE PARTY TO THE ROME </p><p>TREATY - THE RIGHT TO PROSECUTE AN ITALIAN SUSPECT UNDER </p><p>ITALIAN LAW OR TURN THE SUSPECT OVER TO THE ICC.  IT WOULD </p><p>RECOGNIZE THE US\'S RIGHT NOT TO BE A PARTY TO THE TREATY, </p><p>JUST AS THE USG RECOGNIZES ITALY\'S AND OTHERS\' RIGHT TO </p><p>RATIFY IT.  THE USG IS NOT CRITICIZING THE ICC BY SEEKING </p><p>ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS, U/S BOLTON CLARIFIED; WE ARE </p><p>EXPLAINING WHY THE USG BELIEVES SUCH AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE </p><p>PROVIDED FOR IN THE TREATY, ARE NEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ARAGONA ASSURED U/S BOLTON THAT ITALY IS CAREFULLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03849  060939Z </p><p>CONSIDERING THE US REQUEST TO SIGN AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>(REFTEL).  HOWEVER, WHATEVER ACTION THE GOI TAKES MUST BE </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH ITALY\'S COMMITMENT TO THE ICC OR THERE WOULD </p><p>BE A "POLITICAL STORM" WITHIN THE PARLIAMENT AND PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION, HE EXPLAINED.  WHILE ENTERING INTO A RECIPROCAL </p><p>AGREEMENT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A PRACTICAL SOLUTION, ARAGONA SAID </p><p>IT WOULD BE POLITICALLY DIFFICULT FOR ITALY.  THE ITALIAN </p><p>PUBLIC, AS IN EUROPE GENERALLY, IS VERY COMMITTED TO THE ICC, </p><p>ARAGONA SAID, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE TREATY CREATING THE </p><p>COURT WAS SIGNED IN ROME.  HE NOTED DOUBTS WITHIN THE EU </p><p>COMMUNITY ABOUT THE INCLUSION OF ARTICLE 98 IN THE TREATY, AS </p><p>WELL AS THE USG\'S CLAIMS THAT FURTHER PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED. </p><p> US EFFORTS TO SIGN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS ARE SEEN IN EUROPE </p><p>AS ANOTHER WAY TO DISTANCE THE US FROM THE ICC, RATHER THAN A </p><p>MEANS OF HELPING THE US TO ACCEPT THE COURT, ARAGONA </p><p>EXPLAINED.  THE UN DEBATE ON RENEWING THE BOSNIA POLICE FORCE </p><p>(UNMIBH) MANDATE ONLY STRENGTHENED EU COHESION AND SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE ICC, ARAGONA STATED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT.  ARAGONA\'S ANSWER WAS CLEARER, BUT LESS </p><p>POSITIVE, THAN THE ONE WE RECEIVED FROM PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S ADVISOR ON AUGUST 1 (REFTEL).  HIS MOST VALUABLE </p><p>COMMENT WAS HIS STATEMENT (SHORT OF A FIRM COMMITMENT) THAT </p><p>ITALY WOULD WORK TO ENSURE THAT ANY EU DECISION LEFT ROOM FOR </p><p>ITALY AND OTHER STATES TO PROCEED WITH BILATERAL AGREEMENTS. </p><p>WHILE REITERATING BERLUSCONI\'S WILLINGNESS TO HELP, ARAGONA </p><p>COULDN\'T RESIST RECOUNTING THE CRITICISM OF THE USG POSITION </p><p>THAT PREVAILS AMONG EU (AND ITALIAN) LEGAL ADVISORS.  FROM </p><p>OUR POINT OF VIEW, WHAT THE LEGAL TYPES FAIL TO APPRECIATE IS </p><p>THAT AN EU CONSENSUS AGAINST ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS WILL SERVE </p><p>NO PURPOSE EXCEPT TO MAKE THEM FEEL RIGHTEOUS.  IT WOULD NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03849  060939Z </p><p>MAKE ANY DENT IN THE USG POSITION, AND WOULD ONLY BECOME A </p><p>MAJOR IRRITANT IN OUR RELATIONS WITH THE EU AND WITH EU </p><p>MEMBERS.  BUT IF THE DECISION IS LEFT TO THE MFA LEGAL </p><p>ADVISERS (NOT UNLIKELY IF THE DECISION IS TO BE MADE IN </p><p>AUGUST), THAT IS THE OUTCOME WE RISK.  EVEN AS BERLUSCONI AND </p><p>HIS TEAM BEGIN THEIR AUGUST VACATIONS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>PUSH THIS ARGUMENT AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL.  IT WOULD BE </p><p>HELPFUL IF WE COULD ASSURE THE GOI THAT THEY WILL NOT BE </p><p>STANDING ALONE IN RESISTING A NEGATIVE EU CONSENSUS ON </p><p>ARTICLE 98.  EMBASSY ROME WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE DEPARTMENT </p><p>AND OTHER EU POSTS KEEPING US CLOSELY INFORMED ON WHICH OTHER </p><p>EU GOVERNMENTS ARE LEANING IN OUR DIRECTION ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) THIS CABLE HAS BEEN CLEARED BY U/S BOLTON. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03849 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
