The Turkish side presented </p><p>the U.S. a comprehensive package on the rebuilding of Iraq, </p><p>and Ankara reportedly offered to spend part of the $1 </p><p>billion U.S. assistance grant for Turkey for the </p><p>reconstruction effort.  The package also considered a </p><p>possible Turkish contribution to the peacekeeping force in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Weston in Northern Cyprus: After meeting with Greek Cypriot </p><p>President Papadopoulos over the weekend, U.S. Special Cyprus </p><p>Coordinator Tomas Weston met with Turkish Cypriot leader </p><p>Denktas on Monday.  The Greek Cypriot side is ready to </p><p>resume the UN-sponsored talks in September, Weston told </p><p>Denktas.  Denktas declined the offer, however, saying that </p><p>it is no longer possible to revive the Annan plan.  Denktas </p><p>noted that the Turkish Cypriots would join the EU only once </p><p>Turkey\'s full membership is secured. </p><p>New EU adjustment reforms: Papers report on a new government </p><p>effort to increase civilian control over military </p><p>expenditures.  According to proposals in the `seventh\' EU </p><p>reform package, military procurement will become more </p><p>transparent, and military spending will be included in the </p><p>general budget.  Civilians will be assigned to the post of </p><p>National Security Council (NSC) secretary-general, and force </p><p>commanders will be excluded from the NSC.  The new package </p><p>also restricts the authority of the president.  Papers </p><p>speculate that the new package will also expand freedom for </p><p>conducting political propaganda in Kurdish. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President approves takeover of Uzan companies: President </p><p>Sezer approved a Council of Ministers decree ordering the </p><p>takeover of energy plants owned by the Uzan Group.  The </p><p>president\'s approval of the decree without any delay is seen </p><p>as open support for the government\'s decision to seize ten </p><p>energy companies and dams belonging to the Uzan family for </p><p>ongoing violations of contract provisions with the Energy </p><p>Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Commander warns against fundamentalism: On the 164th </p><p>anniversary of the establishment of gendarme forces, General </p><p>Sener Eruygur drew attention to intensified activity by </p><p>radical religious organizations, saying that 4,346 students </p><p>were being given fundamentalist training in a single </p><p>province.  The Gendarme Commander said that secularism must </p><p>be defended in the face of the growing fundamentalist </p><p>threat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a)   Middle East </p><p>b)   Iran </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Future of the US and Palestine state" </p><p>Erhan Basyurt wrote in the Islamist-intellectual Zaman </p><p>(6/17): "If the roadmap fails, it will negatively affect not </p><p>only Israel and Palestine, but also the US and particularly </p><p>the prestige of President Bush.  The US is well aware of the </p><p>fact that the gist of anti-American radicalism stems from </p><p>the Palestinian issue.  In the eyes of the US, a democratic </p><p>Palestinian state is to be the core of a democratic </p><p>restructuring of the Middle East.  To prevent failure, the </p><p>US must be willing to exert its political, economic and </p><p>political clout on both sides in an impartial manner.  Yet </p><p>this balancing act may prove as difficult as finding a </p><p>settlement." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Iran and who is doing what?" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (6/17): "Iran, </p><p>under both internal and external pressure, is experiencing </p><p>its most critical period since the Islamic revolution. </p><p>Iran\'s future is uncertain. . At this stage, we don\'t see a </p><p>move by the masses against the regime.  Yet recent events </p><p>indicate that the people of Iran, for the first time, are </p><p>raising their voices against the system and the regime\'s </p><p>current policies.  It is important to see what action the </p><p>regime will take and how much it will heed the voices of the </p><p>people. . As for the US, its goal is not exactly clear, but </p><p>it goes without saying that the Bush administration wants </p><p>the Tehran regime to end.  . If Washington is determined to </p><p>`deal with\' Iran now, it means that the region will go </p><p>through a very intense period." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
