(SBU)  SUMMARY.  VIETNAM\'S MULTI-ETHNIC SOCIETY REMAINS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02975  01 OF 04  160035Z </p><p>HEAVILY DOMINATED BY THE MAJORITY ETHNIC KINH.  ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES ARE OFTEN LOCATED IN ECONOMICALLY MARGINAL PARTS </p><p>OF VIETNAM, ESPECIALLY THE MOUNTAINOUS AREAS IN THE NORTH, </p><p>NORTHWEST, AND CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  THE GVN HAS UNDERTAKEN A </p><p>VARIETY OF PROGRAMS TO BRING GREATER SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS </p><p>TO THESE AREAS, TO PROMOTE ETHNIC MINORITY CADRES, AND TO </p><p>ENSURE PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WITHIN THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY.  THE EFFORTS BY THE GVN AND CPV TO EXTEND THEIR </p><p>REACH AND TO PROVIDE SERVICES DOWN TO THE LOWEST </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS WITHIN THESE REMOTE AREAS IS </p><p>IMPRESSIVE, BUT PROBABLY HAS AS MUCH TO DO WITH CREATING AND </p><p>MAINTAINING SOCIAL ORDER AND POLITICAL CONTROL AS WITH </p><p>ENSURING THE GENERAL WELL-BEING OF THESE MINORITY </p><p>POPULATIONS.  ALTHOUGH OFFICIALS WOULD PROBABLY DENY IT TO </p><p>THEIR LAST BREATH, MOST VIETNAMESE PROBABLY SEE ASSIMILATION </p><p>AS A DESIRABLE GOAL, AS WELL AS A NATURAL PRODUCT OF </p><p>MODERNIZATION.  WHILE TRYING ECONOMICALLY TO WIN THE HEARTS </p><p>AND MINDS OF THE MINORITY POPULATIONS, AND POLITICALLY TO CO- </p><p>OPT THEM INTO THE SYSTEM, THE NET RESULT WILL LIKELY BE MORE </p><p>AND MORE ETHNIC MINORITIES WHO LOOK AND TALK LIKE EVERYONE </p><p>ELSE, APART FROM SPECIAL FESTIVALS IN WHICH THEY WEAR </p><p>"TRADITIONAL COSTUMES" AND PERFORM QUAINT ETHNIC FOLK DANCES </p><p>AND SONGS.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, REGIONAL DISPARITIES IN HOW </p><p>FAR ALONG THIS PROCESS HAS ALREADY GONE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  OFFICIAL GVN PROPAGANDA BOASTS OF VIETNAM\'S ETHNIC </p><p>DIVERSITY, WITH 54 MAJOR GROUPS, OF WHICH THE MAJORITY KINH </p><p>COMPRISE OVER 85 PCT OF THE POPULATION.  THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>(ARTICLE 5) GUARANTEES "EQUALITY, SOLIDARITY, AND MUTUAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE AMONG ALL NATIONALITIES," AND ALSO "FORBIDS ALL </p><p>ACTS OF NATIONAL DISCRIMINATION AND DIVISION."  ONLY FIVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02975  01 OF 04  160035Z </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS HAVE OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE, </p><p>HOWEVER; FIVE OTHERS HAVE LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE, AND </p><p>ANOTHER 14 GROUPS HAVE FEWER THAN 10,000 PEOPLE, ACCORDING </p><p>TO OFFICIAL STATISTICS.  STATE PROPAGANDA STRESSES THAT "NO </p><p>ETHNIC GROUP POSSESSES ITS OWN TERRITORY," THAT THERE ARE AT </p><p>LEAST SOME ETHNIC MINORITIES LIVING IN ALL 61 PROVINCES AND </p><p>CENTRALLY-CONTROLLED CITIES, AND THAT ONLY NINE PROVINCES </p><p>HAVE MORE THAN 50 PCT OF THEIR POPULATION COMPOSED OF ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES.   AS NOTED IN REFTEL (WHICH EXAMINED ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY EDUCATION), CAO BANG IN NORTHERN VIETNAM (WITH A </p><p>310 KILOMETER BORDER WITH CHINA) HAS THE HIGHEST </p><p>CONCENTRATION OF ETHNIC MINORITIES, MAKING UP 96.07 PCT OF </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>THE VIEW FROM THE CENTER </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS AT THE ETHNIC MINORITIES </p><p>COMMISSION, IN ADDITION TO EXTENSIVE PROGRAMS FOR EDUCATION </p><p>AND FOR INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT (REFTEL), THE GVN ALSO </p><p>OFFERS SPECIAL ASSISTANCE TO ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THE FORMS, </p><p>INTER ALIA, OF: </p><p>--  PRICE SUPPORTS TO EQUALIZE THE COSTS OF CERTAIN CONSUMER </p><p>COMMODITIES; </p><p>--  IN SOME LOCALITIES, DIRECT PAYMENTS OF UP TO 1 MILLION </p><p>DONG (USD 70) PER FAMILY PER YEAR TO OFFSET HIGHER LIVING </p><p>COSTS; </p><p>--  SOME FREE NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTIONS; AND, </p><p>--  SUBSIDIES FOR PHARMACEUTICALS IN SOME CASES, AND FREE </p><p>CARE AT VILLAGE HEALTH CENTERS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02975  01 OF 04  160035Z </p><p>4.  (U)  COMMISSION OFFICIALS HAVE CLAIMED IMPORTANT </p><p>ECONOMIC PROGRESS VIS--VIS THE ETHNIC MINORITIES, AT LEAST </p><p>SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE "DOI MOI" ECONOMIC RENOVATION </p><p>PERIOD IN 1986.  "HALF" OF THE MINORITY POPULATIONS HAVE </p><p>BEEN "FREED FROM POVERTY," A MUCH MORE DRAMATIC RATE OF </p><p>IMPROVEMENT THAN IN THE PREVIOUS DECADES OF VIETNAMESE </p><p>SOCIALISM, THEY NOTED.  AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN "MODERNIZED," </p><p>WITH GREATER VARIETIES OF CROPS INTRODUCED.  HIGHER LEVELS </p><p>OF EDUCATION HAVE PRODUCED "MORE INTELLECTUAL" RURAL </p><p>RESIDENTS AMONG THE MINORITIES.  HOWEVER, OFFICIALS ADMITTED </p><p>THAT "DISPARITIES WILL REMAIN" BETWEEN THE ETHNIC MINORITIES </p><p>IN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS AND THE MAJORITY KINH, AND THAT THE </p><p>STRUGGLE TO "RESOLVE THE PROBLEM OF SOCIAL EQUALITY" WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO POSE A CHALLENGE TO THE GVN.  NOTABLY, EVEN IF </p><p>VIETNAM MEETS THE GVN TARGET OF BECOMING A DEVELOPED COUNTRY </p><p>BY 2020, THE MOUNTAINOUS AREAS "IN REALITY" WILL NOT MAKE IT </p><p>TO THIS LEVEL, OFFICIALS READILY CONFESSED.  ONE OF THE NEW </p><p>CHALLENGES WILL BE TO BALANCE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN </p><p>MOUNTAINOUS AREAS WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THEY ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  OFFICIALS AT THE COMMISSION AND AT THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY HAVE OFTEN CITED THE RELATIVELY HIGH NUMBERS OF </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES (COMPARED TO THEIR PERCENTAGES OF THE </p><p>POPULATION) WITHIN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  IN THE MAY 19 </p><p>ELECTIONS, ALMOST 20 PCT OF THE CANDIDATES WERE ETHNIC </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ7688 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02975  02 OF 04  160036Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    FBIE-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------180D97  160036Z /38 </p><p>R 152357Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8347 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 04 HANOI 002975 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MINORITIES.  61 PCT OF THESE CANDIDATES WON THEIR SEATS, </p><p>PRODUCING A TOTAL OF 86 ETHNIC MINORITY DELEGATES (OUT OF </p><p>498 TOTAL DELEGATES -- ABOUT 17 PCT).  NONG DUC MANH, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02975  02 OF 04  160036Z </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV), </p><p>IS AN ETHNIC TAY FROM BAC KAN PROVINCE, AND THE HIGHEST </p><p>RANKING ETHNIC MINORITY IN SRV HISTORY (OR VIETNAMESE </p><p>HISTORY, FOR THAT MATTER).  HE IS THE SOLE ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>MEMBER ON THE CPV POLITBURO, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE TEN OTHERS </p><p>ON THE 150-PERSON CPV CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  ONLY TWO AMONG THE </p><p>30 GVN MINISTERS (OR EQUIVALENTS) ARE ETHNIC MINORITIES: </p><p>KSOR PHUOC, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ETHNIC MINORITIES </p><p>COMMISSION, AND QUACH LE THANH, THE CHIEF STATE INSPECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>REALITIES IN THE NORTH:  CAO BANG </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  OFFICIALS IN CAO BANG PROVINCE PAINTED A ROSY </p><p>PICTURE OF INTER-ETHNIC HARMONY DURING POL/C\'S NOVEMBER </p><p>VISIT.  ETHNIC TAY MAKE UP THE PLURALITY OF THE POPULATION, </p><p>WITH 40 PCT; ETHNIC KINH COMPOSE LESS THAN 5 PCT.  THEY </p><p>CLAIMED THAT 80 PCT OF ALL CADRES IN THE PROVINCE CAME FROM </p><p>ONE OF THE EIGHT ETHNIC GROUPS, WITH PERCENTAGES OF ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY CADRES EVEN HIGHER AT THE VILLAGE AND COMMUNE </p><p>LEVELS.  A SIMILAR RATIO EXISTS WITHIN THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL, WHILE 100 PCT OF ITS NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>DELEGATES ARE ETHNIC MINORITIES, THEY CLAIMED.  (ACTUALLY, </p><p>ONE CAO BANG NA DELEGATE -- NGUYEN HONG VINH, CPV CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBER AND STANDING DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CC\'S </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS PRESIDENT OF </p><p>VIETNAM JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION -- IS AN ETHNIC KINH.)  CAO </p><p>BANG ALSO CLAIMED A 100 PCT TURNOUT RATE AT THE MAY 19 </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS (NOTE:  AN ASTONISHING FEAT </p><p>ANYWHERE, MUCH LESS IN SUCH A MOUNTAINOUS AND REMOTE AREA. </p><p>END NOTE). </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02975  02 OF 04  160036Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  ACCORDING TO PROVINCIAL VICE CHAIRMAN HOANG VAN </p><p>KHOI (HIMSELF AN ETHNIC TAY), THE VARIOUS ETHNIC GROUPS NOT </p><p>ONLY INCREASINGLY LIVE IN MIXED COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO </p><p>NOWADAYS MARRY EACH OTHER MORE FREQUENTLY.  (HE IS MARRIED </p><p>TO AN ETHNIC KINH, WHO SPEAKS FLUENT TAY, HE SAID.)  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THERE WAS NOT, AND HAD NEVER HAD BEEN, ANY </p><p>FIGHTING AMONG ETHNIC GROUPS.  THE CURRENT REALITY, HE </p><p>NOTED, WAS THAT IT WAS MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>DIFFERENTIATE AMONG THE ETHNIC MINORITIES, SINCE VIRTUALLY </p><p>ALL HAVE TURNED TO MORE "CONVENIENT" WESTERN-STYLE CLOTHES, </p><p>AND SPEAK VIETNAMESE EXCEPT PERHAPS AT HOME.  LOCAL MARRIAGE </p><p>TRADITIONS MIRROR THOSE OF THE MAJORITY KINH:  90 PCT OF </p><p>BRIDES GO TO LIVE WITH THEIR HUSBAND\'S FAMILIES, OFFICIALS </p><p>CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  VICE CHAIRMAN KHOI AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS </p><p>DESCRIBED A PROVINCE THAT HAS "VERY LITTLE RELIGION," WHICH </p><p>THEY ASCRIBED TO THE NON-RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS OF THE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES (AS OPPOSED TO THE MORE TRADITIONALLY BUDDHIST </p><p>KINH, FOR EXAMPLE).  KHOI SAID THERE WERE "ONLY A FEW" </p><p>BUDDHIST TEMPLES IN THE ENTIRE PROVINCE, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE </p><p>SOME TRADITIONAL "HALLS" FOR ANCESTOR WORSHIP AND OTHER </p><p>COMMUNAL "CULTURAL" ACTIVITIES.  HE CLAIMED THAT THERE WERE </p><p>"NO" PROTESTANT CHURCHES, EVEN AMONG THE HMONG, AND ONLY </p><p>"SOME" CATHOLIC CHURCHES, INCLUDING ONE LARGE FRENCH-ERA </p><p>CHURCH PERCHED ON A HILLSIDE IN DOWNTOWN CAO BANG CITY. </p><p>KHOI SAID HE BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE CATHOLIC </p><p>PRIEST IN THE ENTIRE PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>ANOTHER REALITY CHECK:  BAC KAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02975  02 OF 04  160036Z </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  OFFICIALS IN BAC KAN PROVINCE DESCRIBED A VARIETY </p><p>OF RURAL DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES, WHO MAKE UP ABOUT 55 PCT OF THE TOTAL </p><p>POPULATION, ACCORDING TO NATIONAL STATISTICS.  (NOTE: </p><p>PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS CLAIMED THAT ETHNIC KINH MADE UP ONLY </p><p>ABOUT 15 PCT OF THE PROVINCIAL POPULATION, WHILE ETHNIC TAY </p><p>REPRESENTED 50 PCT OF THE TOTAL, BUT THE ETHNIC MINORITIES </p><p>COMMISSION IN HANOI SUBSEQUENTLY INSISTED THAT ITS </p><p>STATISTICS WERE MORE ACCURATE.  END NOTE)  THEY EXPRESSED </p><p>HOPE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROVEN EXTENSIVE MINERAL </p><p>RESOURCES WILL BE ATTRACTIVE TO FOREIGN INVESTORS (INCLUDING </p><p>FROM THE U.S.), ALONG WITH THE PROCESSING OF BAC KAN\'S LARGE </p><p>TIMBER RESERVES.  THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THE DANGERS OF </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IN THIS DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS, AS </p><p>WELL AS THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE CURRENTLY POOR ROAD LINKS </p><p>WITH HANOI AND OTHER MARKETS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  PROVINCIAL CADRES ARE VIRTUALLY ALL ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES, OFFICIALS CLAIMED, WITH THE MAJORITY BELONGING </p><p>TO THE TAY GROUP.  FOUR OUT OF BAC KAN\'S SIX NEW NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY DELEGATES ARE ETHNIC MINORITIES; THE TWO ETHNIC </p><p>KINH DELEGATES ARE HANOI RESIDENTS (ONE IS DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER PHAM GIA KHIEM).

(U)  BAC KAN OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PROVINCIAL VICE </p><p>CHAIRMAN NONG VAN LENH, CLAIMED "EXCELLENT" RELATIONS AMONG </p><p>THE SEVEN MAIN ETHNIC GROUPS, INCLUDING INCREASING LEVELS OF </p><p>INTER-MARRIAGE.  THEY NOTED "NO DISCRIMINATION" AMONG THE </p><p>ETHNIC GROUPS, BUT ADMITTED THAT THE HMONG GROUP WAS LESS </p><p>WELL INTEGRATED DUE PRIMARILY TO THEIR MORE REMOTE LOCATIONS </p><p>AND LESS FREQUENT INTER-ACTION.  AS IN CAO BANG, BAC KAN </p><p>OFFICIALS PORTRAYED THEIR PROVINCIAL POPULATION AS LARGELY </p><p>NON-RELIGIOUS, APART FROM GENERALLY SHARED TRADITIONS OF </p><p>ANCESTOR WORSHIP.  THEY CLAIMED THAT THERE WAS "LITTLE" </p><p>BUDDHISM, AND ONLY "A FEW" CATHOLICS, WHO HAD NEITHER CHURCH </p><p>NOR PRIEST.  AMONG THE HMONG (ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO EMIGRATED </p><p>FROM CHINA IN OR SHORTLY AFTER 1979, THEY NOTED), THERE WERE </p><p>SOME PROTESTANTS, BUT WITH NO FORMAL CHURCHES OR PASTORS. </p><p>THEY ADMITTED THAT RELIGIOUS BROADCASTING IN THE HMONG </p><p>LANGUAGE FROM THE PHILIPPINES WAS HAVING SOME IMPACT IN </p><p>ATTRACTING NEW BELIEVERS, HOWEVER.  THEY ADDED THAT THERE </p><p>HAD BEEN "NO REQUESTS" TO REGISTER ANY CHURCHES, NOR HAD </p><p>THERE EVER BEEN "ANY PROBLEMS" WITH RELIGIOUS BELIEF, </p><p>HOWEVER.  THEY CATEGORICALLY DENIED ANY EFFORTS BY OFFICIALS </p><p>TO FORCE RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS TO RECANT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  OFFICIALS NOTED THAT SOME ETHNIC MINORITIES -- </p><p>PRIMARILY TAY, HMONG, AND DAO -- FROM BAC KAN HAD BEEN AMONG </p><p>THOSE WHO HAD MIGRATED IN RECENT YEARS TO THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS, BUT DESCRIBED THESE AS STRICTLY "VOLUNTARY" RE- </p><p>LOCATIONS.  "MANY" HAD SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS, DESCRIBING EVEN GREATER HARDSHIPS IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS, THEY NOTED, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  LOOKING MORE ALIKE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02975  03 OF 04  160036Z </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  IN THESE MOUNTAINOUS AREAS, ALONG WINDING, </p><p>RUDIMENTARY, AND SOMETIMES DANGEROUS "ROADS," THE OUTREACH </p><p>OF THE GVN -- AND CPV -- IS FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE.  SCHOOLS, </p><p>MEDICAL CLINICS, POST OFFICES, AND, INCREASINGLY, </p><p>ELECTRICITY OFTEN REACH DOWN TO VERY REMOTE SETTLEMENTS, </p><p>ALONG WITH THE PERVASIVE DUAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND PARTY </p><p>CADRES.  THE GVN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN METICULOUS AS WELL IN </p><p>SETTLING UP THE FULL PANOPLY OF REPRESENTATIVE ORGANS -- </p><p>"THE PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS" -- DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL.  THE </p><p>2002 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS WERE NOTABLE BY CLEARLY </p><p>IDENTIFYING THE ETHNIC BACKGROUND OF ALL CANDIDATES AND IN </p><p>RETURNING A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>DELEGATES THAN THEIR SHARE OF THE POPULATION WOULD </p><p>STATISTICALLY WARRANT.  GVN OFFICIALS LIKE TO BOAST THAT </p><p>SUCH RESULTS PUT VIETNAM AHEAD OF THE U.S. IN ENSURING FAIR </p><p>REPRESENTATION OF ALL ETHNIC MINORITIES, AT LEAST WITHIN THE </p><p>NATIONAL LEGISLATURE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  GVN AND CPV EFFORTS TO ORGANIZE DOWN TO THE </p><p>GRASSROOTS LIKELY MORE PROFOUNDLY REFLECT THE CPV\'S LENINIST </p><p>MODEL THAN ITS CONCERN FOR THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC WELL- </p><p>BEING OF THE ETHNIC MINORITIES -- ALTHOUGH SUCH CONCERN </p><p>CLEARLY DOES EXIST.  UPON ACHIEVING FIRST INDEPENDENCE AND </p><p>LATER NATIONAL UNIFICATION, THE GVN/CPV\'S TOP PRIORITY WAS </p><p>ON CREATING SOCIAL ORDER AND ENSURING UNCHALLENGED CPV RULE. </p><p>GIVEN THE HISTORICAL ISOLATION OF SOME ETHNIC GROUPS -- AND </p><p>IN SOME CASES, OPPOSITION TO THE CPV (ALTHOUGH SOME ETHNIC </p><p>GROUPS, ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH, WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE CPV </p><p>EVEN IN ITS INFANCY) -- THE GVN AND CPV VIEWED A STRONG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02975  03 OF 04  160036Z </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL NETWORK AS ESSENTIAL; IN MANY PLACES, SUCH AN </p><p>OFFICIAL PRESENCE WAS ALSO UNPRECEDENTED.  THE ECONOMIC </p><p>RESULTS MAY HAVE BEEN MARGINAL (AS ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM) </p><p>UNTIL THE DOI MOI ERA, BUT THE GVN HAS SINCE 1986 -- AND </p><p>ESPECIALLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS -- DEVOTED EVER- </p><p>HIGHER LEVELS OF RESOURCES AIMED AT THE MOUNTAINOUS AREAS. </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY RIGHT IN ASSESSING THAT THEY </p><p>CANNOT ELIMINATE THE DISPARITIES WITH LOWLAND AREAS AND </p><p>ESPECIALLY WITH URBAN CENTERS (THOSE GAPS MAY INDEED NOW BE </p><p>WIDENING), BUT CURRENT EFFORTS ARE IN MANY CASES PAYING OFF </p><p>IN IMPROVING LIVING STANDARDS AND IN WINNING SOME ADDITIONAL </p><p>LOYALTY AND GRATITUDE AMONG MANY OF THE ETHNIC MINORITIES IN </p><p>THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST. </p><p> </p><p>14.
