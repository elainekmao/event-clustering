Maoist atrocities continue with the brutal </p><p>murders of two people and the serious injury of another, and </p><p>reports of increasing extortion, combat and explosives </p><p>training, recruitment of minors, levying of taxes, and </p><p>obstruction of development projects.  Victims of the </p><p>insurgency and residents of some of the most remote areas of </p><p>Nepal voiced concern over the continuation of struggles and </p><p>threats despite the ceasefire.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>PRACHANDA WANTS PARTIES\' SUPPORT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  In a press release issued on June 29 Pushpa Kamal Dahal, </p><p>alias Prachanda, Maoist supreme leader, called upon the five </p><p>major political parties of Nepal (Nepali Congress, the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist, Janamorcha </p><p>Nepal, Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, and Nepal </p><p>Sadbhawana Party) to support the twenty-four demands put </p><p>forth by the Maoists during the first round of peace </p><p>negotiations (Ref A).  None of the party leaders have yet </p><p>responded. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Maoist Supremo again warned against alleged </p><p>interference by international forces, declaring that there </p><p>was a "serious conspiracy from within and outside the </p><p>country" attempting to derail the peace process.  Prachanda </p><p>called for unity against the "increasing interference of the </p><p>foreign forces," and urged public pressure against the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON).  He also declared that it would </p><p>be a "great disaster" if the peace negotiations were </p><p>disrupted. </p><p> </p><p>ACCUSATIONS OF VIOLATIONS ALL AROUND </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  Amid concerns over the fragile peace process, </p><p>representatives from the GON and the Maoist party traded </p><p>accusations of ceasefire violations.  In a statement issued </p><p>on June 27 the Ministry of Defense blamed the Maoists for </p><p>creating "social terror" through ongoing extortion </p><p>campaigns.  The Ministry said the insurgents have demanded </p><p>and collected almost USD 150,000 from people and </p><p>institutions despite the declaration of a ceasefire. </p><p>Condemning the illegal activities, the Ministry warned that </p><p>security forces would exact severe punishment in accordance </p><p>with the law against those responsible. </p><p> </p><p>6.  In addition to criminal violations of the ceasefire, the </p><p>local press reports that the Maoists are engaged in </p><p>organized combat training and explosives-making in rural </p><p>villages.  The Maoists allegedly shut down a school in the </p><p>far western district of Baitadi and used it to conduct </p><p>military and explosives training for the youth of the </p><p>village.  Security personnel are stationed in District </p><p>headquarters, but there reportedly were no security </p><p>personnel in the immediate area of the Maoist training. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman, hurled his own </p><p>accusations, claiming that the GON was violating the code of </p><p>conduct, and that the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) was terrorizing </p><p>Maoists in rural parts of Nepal.  In a press release dated </p><p>June 29 Prachanda accused the GON of not taking the Maoists </p><p>seriously, and he also accused the RNA of using US made </p><p>weapons to kill Nepalis, citing the "mass killings" in </p><p>Jajarkot District (Ref B).  (FYI:  We have no credible </p><p>information of US-made weapons being used against civilians. </p><p>End FYI) </p><p> </p><p>KEEPING COUNT </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Maoist violations of the code of conduct appear to be </p><p>increasing, and several organizations are keeping count. </p><p>Quoting statistics reportedly obtained from security forces, </p><p>the local press reported that the insurgents violated the </p><p>code of conduct at least thirty different times throughout </p><p>fifteen districts during the period of May 22-June 30. </p><p>Violations included extortion, abductions, looting, seizure </p><p>of land, and physical violence.  Senior Maoist leaders, </p><p>however, continue to assert that their cadres are abiding by </p><p>the code of conduct and only collect voluntary donations. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), a local NGO, </p><p>also detailed numerous violations allegedly committed by </p><p>both the insurgents and security personnel during the period </p><p>of June 9-24.  INSEC\'s report included an alleged gang rape </p><p>of a woman by a group of men professing to be Maoists, as </p><p>well as other incidents of looting.  Security forces were </p><p>accused of rape, torture and assault in separate incidences. </p><p> </p><p>GON "READY FOR TALKS" </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  In an attempt to make progress in the stalled peace </p><p>negotiations, facilitators met separately with </p><p>representatives of the GON and Maoist negotiating teams on </p><p>July 1.   According to facilitators, the two sides have </p><p>agreed to sit for a third round of talks soon. Kamal Thapa, </p><p>Minister of Information and Communications and GON </p><p>negotiating team member, said on June 29 that the GON was </p><p>"ready for talks" at any time, but was awaiting a response </p><p>from the Maoists.  Thapa reportedly spoke informally with </p><p>Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman, on June 27 in an </p><p>attempt to set up a date for the third round of peace </p><p>negotiations.  According to press reports, Minister Thapa </p><p>was hopeful that the next round would be held in mid-July, </p><p>and hinted that part of the agenda would focus on the </p><p>agreements made during the second round of talks, including </p><p>the controversial issue of the army\'s restriction to a 5- </p><p>kilometer radius from their barracks, and the disputes </p><p>regarding alleged violations of the code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman and </p><p>negotiating team member, said on July 1 that the controversy </p><p>over the restriction of the army\'s movement should not </p><p>hinder the progress of the peace negotiations.  Mahara said, </p><p>however, that the GON should implement the other agreements </p><p>that were made, including the release of imprisoned Central </p><p>Committee Members. </p><p> </p><p>NEW MAOIST PHILOSOPHY? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  On July 1 Mahara told an audience of members of the </p><p>lower castes that the right to rebel should be guaranteed. </p><p>In direct contrast to traditional communist doctrine, Mahara </p><p>said the Maoist Central Committee was committed to launching </p><p>a new model of democracy which would ensure the "right to </p><p>rebel and renounce the communist dictatorship."  In an </p><p>apparent attempt to explain the surprising new philosophy, </p><p>Mahara pledged that the Maoists were for the people and the </p><p>people should revolt when someone goes against their wishes. </p><p>He claimed his party was progressive, and it was not crucial </p><p>to stick to policies made seven years ago at the beginning </p><p>of the "Peoples\' War." </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST TERROR GOES ON </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  Maoists in far northeastern Taplejung District </p><p>reportedly are actively recruiting minors, some as young as </p><p>twelve years old.  A Maoist leader in the district denied </p><p>the accusations, but conceded that the insurgents had opened </p><p>a recruitment center after local youths showed an interest </p><p>in joining the Maoists.  He also claimed that the Maoists </p><p>did not recruit anyone less than sixteen years of age.  A </p><p>reliable Embassy contact from the district reports that </p><p>parents from her village are sending their children </p><p>unaccompanied to Kathmandu to protect them from Maoist </p><p>conscription. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Maoists brutally murdered two people and seriously </p><p>injured another.  On June 27 the insurgents allegedly hacked </p><p>to death a Nepali Congress (NC) activist in Baglung </p><p>District.  On July 1 four Maoists reportedly stormed into </p><p>the home of the headmaster of a private school in Lalitpur </p><p>District of Kathmandu Valley.  The insurgents stabbed him </p><p>and his wife repeatedly, killing the wife and seriously </p><p>injuring the principal.  Maoists in Sarlahi District </p><p>reportedly are openly demanding donations as high as two </p><p>thousand dollars, an exorbitant amount in rural areas.  The </p><p>Superintendent of Police in the district told the local </p><p>press on June 29 that the Maoists continue to extort, murder </p><p>and kidnap despite the ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Insurgents in the far western district of Dolpa </p><p>reportedly have posted rules and regulations throughout the </p><p>district, renamed parts of the region, and instituted their </p><p>own form of government.  According to the local press, the </p><p>Maoists have seized control of several Village Development </p><p>Committees (VDC) and renamed them "Village Peoples\' </p><p>Committees."  The insurgents have implemented trade </p><p>guidelines in which merchants are required to register and </p><p>receive permission from the Maoists in order to conduct </p><p>business.  A tax collection system has also been set up, </p><p>along with special "courts" where the Maoists impose their </p><p>own form of justice and punishment.  The GON\'s Chief </p><p>District Officer (CDO) admitted there were several areas </p><p>that are "severely affected" by the Maoists, but denied that </p><p>the district administration has lost control of the region. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Construction of a hydropower project in Lamjung </p><p>District remains postponed indefinitely after the Maoists </p><p>reportedly banned workers from entering the village a year </p><p>ago.  Officials with the Annapurna Conservation Area Project </p><p>(ACAP) said on June 29 that Maoists still have not allowed </p><p>work to begin, despite the ceasefire.  Almost five hundred </p><p>homes would benefit from the project. </p><p>CEASEFIRE OFFERS LITTLE COMFORT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>17.  The declaration of a ceasefire has done little to </p><p>comfort victims of the Maoist insurgency.  Despite the pleas </p><p>made by Maoists for people to return to their homes after </p><p>the declaration of the ceasefire, some who returned </p><p>reportedly were killed by the insurgents while others were </p><p>forced to donate large sums of money.  According to the </p><p>Maoist Victims Association (MVA), a local organization, </p><p>there are over one thousand registered victims who fled to </p><p>Kathmandu and abandoned their homes, land and livelihoods </p><p>out of fear of the Maoists.  Victims claim that the Maoists </p><p>now move freely throughout rural areas and openly extort </p><p>money and torture people, making it impossible to return </p><p>home.  MVA claims that because of the ceasefire, the GON has </p><p>also stopped financial assistance. </p><p> </p><p>18.  In the far eastern district of Tehrathum, a two-year </p><p>ban on the sale of agricultural goods imposed by the Maoists </p><p>still has not been lifted despite the ceasefire.  Villagers </p><p>whose livelihood depends on the outside sale of agricultural </p><p>products said that there is no "difference before and after </p><p>the cease-fire," and lament that the insurgents continue </p><p>extortion and abduction due to the lack of security </p><p>personnel.  The code of conduct agreed to by the GON and the </p><p>Maoists allows for the unrestricted transport of food, </p><p>medicine and other goods. </p><p> </p><p>19.  The Government of Japan is providing humanitarian aid </p><p>for victims of the Maoist insurgency in the mid-western </p><p>district of Rolpa.  Over two hundred displaced families are </p><p>receiving donations of rice, vegetables, ready-made food </p><p>items and utensils. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
