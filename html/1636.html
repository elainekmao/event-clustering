REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01306  121142Z </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 1259  B) HARARE 1079 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON APRIL 11, A ZIMBABWEAN EMPLOYEE OF THE EMBASSY MET ALONE </p><p>WITH MINISTER OF DEFENSE MOVEN MAHACHI, A LONGTIME CLOSE FRIEND OF </p><p>THE FAMILY, AT MAHACHI\'S REQUEST.  IN THE MEETING IN THE MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE, MAHACHI SOLICITED THE INFORMAL LEGAL ADVICE OF OUR EMPLOYEE </p><p>--A LAWYER BY TRAINING -- REGARDING THE MDC\'S PENDING COURT </p><p>CHALLENGE OF HIS VICTORY IN LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION (ONE </p><p>OF THE 37 SEATS UNDER CHALLENGE).  THE EMPLOYEE DEMURRED, STATING </p><p>THAT SHE HAD NOT FOLLOWED THE DETAILS OF HIS CASE CLOSELY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) OUR EMPLOYEE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK MAHACHI ABOUT </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE\'S COMMENTS IN PARLIAMENT ON APRIL 4 </p><p>THREATENING IMPOSITION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY (REF A).  MAHACHI </p><p>APPEARED UNEASY AT THE QUESTION BUT CONFIRMED IT IS ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>INTENTION TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY "IF SANCTIONS ARE IMPOSED </p><p>ON THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT." HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE LAW PERMITS </p><p>SUCH AN ACTION.  MAHACHI MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>CONCERN THAT PASSAGE OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY ACT WOULD PREVENT THE WORLD BANK AND IMF FROM PROVIDING </p><p>ANY ASSISTANCE TO ZIMBABWE.  IN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WOULD HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY, AS </p><p>THE NATION COULD NOT SURVIVE WITHOUT AID FROM THE IFIS.  THE </p><p>MINISTER CRITICIZED THE IMF AND WORLD BANK FOR PROVIDING ASSISTANCE </p><p>TO RWANDA AND UGANDA -- WHICH HAD INVADED THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC </p><p>OF CONGO -- WHILE CUTTING OFF ZIMBABWE, WHICH HAD GOTTEN INVOLVED </p><p>IN THE CONFLICT TO DEFEND A NATION\'S SOVEREIGNTY. (COMMENT: THE </p><p>MINISTER\'S HOARY AND ERRONEOUS CORRELATION OF ZIMBABWE\'S DRC </p><p>INVOLVEMENT WITH SUSPENSION OF FUND FLOWS FROM THE IFIS REFLECTS </p><p>THE US VS. THEM ATTITUDE PREVALENT IN THE POLITBURO.  IT IGNORES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01306  121142Z </p><p>THE HOST OF OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING ARREARS AND TECHNICAL DEFAULT, </p><p>WRONG POLICIES, BAD MANAGEMENT AND INACTION THAT THE GOZ ITSELF IS </p><p>DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) UNPROMPTED, THE DEFENSE MINISTER WENT ON TO EXPLAIN IN SOME </p><p>DETAIL THAT A STATE OF EMERGENCY WOULD GIVE THE GOVERNMENT THE </p><p>POWERS IT NEEDS TO REASSERT CONTROL OVER THE ECONOMY. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, THE GOZ WOULD DIRECT THAT ALL OF THE COUNTRY\'S SCARCE </p><p>FOREIGN EXCHANGE BE TRANSFERRED TO THE RESERVE BANK OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p>IN ADDITION, LIMITED FUEL SUPPLIES WOULD BE STRICTLY RATIONED AND </p><p>ALL POLITICAL ACTIVITY PROHIBITED.  ASKED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF A </p><p>STATE OF EMERGENCY ON THE TIMING OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>EXPECTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002, MAHACHI REPLIED THAT IT </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE POSTPONED UNTIL AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS FREELY EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE WAS POSSIBLE.  HE </p><p>SAID UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT AN EARLY ELECTION WOULD NOT BE HELD. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MOVEN MAHACHI IS A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND OF PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE AND A MEMBER OF THE RULING PARTY POLITBURO.  HE, THEREFORE, </p><p>CAN SPEAK AUTHORITATIVELY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT\'S THINKING AND THAT </p><p>OF OTHER SENIOR ZANU-PF INSIDERS.  IT IS CLEAR FROM HIS COMMENTS -- </p><p>AND THOSE OFFOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE -- THAT HE AND OTHERS WIT </p><p>INFLUENCE HAVE DONE SOME THINKING ABOUT THE POSIBILITY OF A STATE </p><p>OF EMERGENCY, INCLUDING THE LEGAL BASIS FOR SUCH ACTION, WHAT MIGHT </p><p>PROMPT IT, ND WHAT STEPS THE GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE IF ONE WER </p><p>IMPOSED.  IT IS LESS CERTAIN, HOWEVER, WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO IMPOSE A STATE OF EMERGENCY -- BECAUSE IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01306  121142Z </p><p>REALIZES THAT IT CANNOT WIN A FREE AND FAIR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION - </p><p>- OR WHETHER THE OMINOUS REMARKS ARE A BLUFF INTENDED TO PRESSURE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NOT TO IMPOSE PUNITIVE </p><p>MEASURES.  ALTHOUGH AT THIS TIME WE ARE INCLINED MORE TOWARD THE </p><p>SECOND INTERPRETATION, THE FACT THAT MAHACHI WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE A </p><p>FAIRLY DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF WHAT ZIMBABWE WOULD LOOK LIKE UNDER </p><p>A STATE OF EMERGENCY STRONGLY INDICATES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>EXAMINED AND DISCUSSED SUCH AN EVENTUALITY, AND IS OUT OF THE GATE </p><p>IN PREPARING FOR IT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MAHACHI\'S REMARKS ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S WISH TO ASSERT </p><p>GREATER CONTROL OVER THE ECONOMY REFLECT THE THINKING OF A </p><p>PARTICULARLY HARDLINE TENDENCY WITHIN THE PARTY AND, TO OUR </p><p>KNOWLEDGE, DOES NOT CONSTITUTE OFFICIAL POLICY.  ON THE CONTRARY, </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER MAKONI ASSURED US ON APRIL 11 THAT HE WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO FIND WAYS TO STIMULATE REAL GROWTH AND BROADER PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>THE ECONOMY AND LURE FOREIGN INVESTMENT BACK TO ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
