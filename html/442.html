<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RIYADH 01809 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USIA FOR NEA - RUGH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KISL, PROP, PREL, IZ, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  OVERVIEW OF SAUDI ARABIA\'S JIHAD CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) RIYADH 1663 (NOTAL); (B) RIYADH 1724 (NOTAL); </p><p>(C) RIYADH 1789 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE UNPRECEDENTED CONVENTION ON THE CONCEPT </p><p>OF JIHAD AND ITS RELATION TO THE GULF CRISIS ENDED IN </p><p>RIYADH FEBRUARY 20 AFTER THREE DAYS OF DISCUSSION BY </p><p>PERHAPS THE MOST DIVERSE GATHERING EVER OF SAUDI </p><p>RELIGIOUS, GOVERNMENT, AND MEDIA PERSONALITIES.  THE </p><p>HOLDING OF THE CONVENTION WAS ITSELF A MAJOR STEP FORWARD </p><p>IN THE KINGDOM\'S EFFORTS TO DEFINE THE TERMS OF DEBATE </p><p>ABOUT THE GULF WAR IN BOTH SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES WITH MUSLIM POPULATIONS.  WITH A DAILY AUDIENCE </p><p>OF MORE THAN 1000 PEOPLE, INCLUDING SOME 200 FOREIGN </p><p>GUESTS WHOSE EXPENSES WERE COVERED BY SAUDI AUTHORITIES, </p><p>AND WITH IN-DEPTH COVERAGE FROM ALL SAUDI MEDIA, THE SAG </p><p>CLEARLY PUT FORTH ITS BEST POSSIBLE EFFORTS IN HELPING TO </p><p>HOST AND ADMINISTER THE CONVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE CONVENTION\'S MAJOR TOPICS OF DISCUSSION WERE </p><p>GENERALLY THE SAME ONES PROMOTED BY THE SAG SINCE LAST </p><p>AUGUST:  FINDING RELIGIOUS GROUNDS FOR ACTIONS AGAINST </p><p>SADDAM, INCLUDING THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN FORCES IN THE </p><p>KINGDOM; EXPLAINING POPULAR PERCEPTIONS OF THE CRISIS IN </p><p>THE ARAB AND MUSLIM WORLD; AND DESCRIBING THE ROLES </p><p>PLAYED BY LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA IN COVERAGE OF </p><p>THE CRISIS.  ATTENDEES LEFT THE CONVENTION WITH THEIR OWN </p><p>BELIEFS STRENGTHENED AND, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF </p><p>FOREIGN GUESTS, AN INCREASED ABILITY TO SUPPORT SAG </p><p>POSITIONS ON THE GULF WAR AND COUNTER IRAQI PROPAGANDA </p><p>EFFORTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THIS IS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL REPORTS ON THE JIHAD </p><p>CONVENTION AND PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF DISCUSSION DURING </p><p>THE THREE DAYS.  OTHER REPORTS WILL FOCUS ON SPECIFIC </p><p>ASPECTS OF THE CONVENTION AND REACTION BY PARTICIPANTS AS </p><p>WELL AS OTHER SAUDIS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SAUDI PARTICIPANTS: THE GANG\'S ALL HERE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  AS REPORTED REF A, A LEADING SAUDI ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY </p><p>SERVED AS HOST FOR A THREE-DAY CONVENTION (MUHRAJAN) TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE CONCEPT OF JIHAD AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE </p><p>GULF WAR.  PRE-CONVENTION ANNOUNCEMENTS, HOWEVER, DID NOT </p><p>MAKE CLEAR THE UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER AND SCOPE OF SAUDI </p><p>LUMINARIES WHO WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE SIX OFFICIAL </p><p>SESSIONS.  THE CONFERENCE WAS OPENED BY DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>SULTAN, WHO READ A SPEECH BY KING FAHD (REF A) AND HELD </p><p>AN IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCE AFTERWARDS.  OTHER </p><p>IMPORTANT SAUDIS AND FOREIGNERS ON STAGE FOR THE OPENING </p><p>SESSION INCLUDED EDUCATION MINISTER ABDULLAH </p><p>AL-KHUWAYTIR, OIC SECRETARY-GENERAL HAMID AL-GABID, </p><p>EGYPTIAN GRAND MUFTI MOHAMMED SYED TANTAWI, AL-AZHAR </p><p>VICE-PRESIDENT AHMED OMAR HASHEM, AND THE HOST OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE, DR. ABDALLAH BIN ABDULRAHMAN AL-TURKI, THE </p><p>RECTOR OF IMAM MOHAMED BIN SAUD UNIVERSITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RELIGIOUS AND ROYAL ATTENDANCE: EVEN BIN BAZ COMES OUT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  PERHAPS THE GREATEST SURPRISE OF THE CONVENTION WAS </p><p>THE REGULAR ATTENDANCE OF SENIOR SAUDI RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR </p><p>SHAYKH ABDULAZIZ BIN ABDULLAH BIN BAZ.  SEATED ON </p><p>SULTAN\'S RIGHT FOR THE OPENING SESSION AND IN THE FRONT </p><p>ROW OF THE AUDITORIUM FOR THE SYMPOSIA WHICH FOLLOWED, </p><p>THE ELDERLY AND BLIND BIN BAZ WAS QUICK TO MAKE </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE CONVENTION.  HE MADE THE </p><p>THIRD SPEECH OF THE OPENING SESSION (FOLLOWING SULTAN AND </p><p>DR. AL-TURKI) AND WAS REGULARLY INVITED TO MAKE CLOSING </p><p>COMMENTS FOR ALL OTHER SESSIONS.  DURING A PRIVATE </p><p>AUDIENCE OF FOREIGN GUESTS WITH KING FAHD AND CROWN </p><p>PRINCE ABDULLAH (REF C), BIN BAZ EVEN INTERUPTED THE KING </p><p>TO EXPOUND UPON RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATION FOR THE KINGDOM\'S </p><p>GULF CRISIS POLICIES.  BIN BAZ WAS JOINED AT ALL SESSIONS </p><p>OF THE CONVENTION BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME </p><p>COUNCIL OF ULEMA, THE HIGHEST SAUDI RELIGIOUS BODY, AS </p><p>WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER SAUDI RELIGIOUS FIGURES.  TO NO </p><p>ONE\'S SURPRISE, MOST OF THE RELIGIOUS COMMENTARY REPEATED </p><p>THE SAME CALLS OF SUPPORT FOR GOD AND KINGDOM HEARD IN </p><p>THE EARLY DAYS OF THE CRISIS, ALTHOUGH A FEW AWKWARD </p><p>MOMENTS PROVED THAT THE MOST SENIOR OFFICIALS WERE STILL </p><p>UNFAMILIAR WITH THE INTRICACIES OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION </p><p>BEFORE A LARGE GROUP (REPORTED SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  ROYAL ATTENDEES WHO SPOKE AT VARIOUS SESSIONS </p><p>INCLUDED SEVERAL REGULAR EMBASSY CONTACTS, SUCH AS MFA </p><p>OFFICIAL (AND KING FAHD\'S SON-IN-LAW) DR. PRINCE TURKI </p><p>BIN MOHAMMED SAUD AL-KABIR, DEPUTY INTERIOR MINISTER (AND </p><p>POET) IBRAHIM AL-AWAJI, AND PETROLEUM MINISTRY ADVISOR </p><p>PRINCE ABDULAZIZ BIN SALMAN.  AMONG THE MANY OTHER </p><p>PROMINENT SAUDI SPEAKERS WERE OFFICIALS FROM THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF INFORMATION, MILITARY AND CIVIL DEFENSE OFFICERS, </p><p>POETS AND OTHER LITERATI, AND PRINT MEDIA EDITORS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, NUMEROUS VIP SEATS WERE OCCUPIED THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>CONFERENCE BY MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY AND VARIOUS </p><p>RELIGIOUS FIGURES, AND MINISTER OF INTERIOR PRICE NAYIF </p><p>BIN ABD AL-AZIZ HOSTED A LUNCHEON FOR SELECTED </p><p>PARTICIPANTS ON THE FINAL DAY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN GUESTS: LITTLE SPEAKING TIME, ALL EXPENSES PAID </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  FOREIGNERS ATTENDING THE CONVENTION WERE GENERALLY </p><p>RESTRICTED TO SHORT COMMENTARIES ABOUT PRESENTATIONS BY </p><p>SAUDIS ON THE SIX PANELS.  OF THE FEW FOREIGNERS GRANTED </p><p>COMPARABLE SPEAKING TIME, THE BEST RECEIVED WERE THE </p><p>WELL-KNOWN KUWAITI RELIGIOUS LEADER SHAYKH AHMED AL-QITAN </p><p>(ONE OF THE FEW NON-SAUDIS SEATED ON STAGE AFTER THE </p><p>OPENING SESSION) AND TWO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AFGHAN </p><p>MUJAHIDEEN.  IN CONTRAST TO THE SOMEWHAT BLAND </p><p>PRESENTATIONS MADE BY MOST SAUDI SPEAKERS, THE KUWAITI </p><p>AND AFGHANIS HELD THE AUDIENCE\'S ATTENTION AND RECIEVED </p><p>THE STRONGEST RESPONSES BY NOTING, RESPECTIVELY, THE </p><p>ATROCITIES OF THE IRAQI MILITARY IN KUWAIT AND THE </p><p>SIMILARITIES BETWEEN KUWAIT AND AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  NONETHELESS, THE NUMEROUS FOREIGN ATTENDEES SEEMED </p><p>SATISFIED WITH THE CONFERENCE.  OUR EARLY ESTIMATES ARE </p><p>THAT 15-20 OF THE 31 COUNTRIES INVITED SENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES, APPARENTLY WITH ALL EXPENSES PAID BY THE </p><p>SAG.  A WESTERN HEMISPHERE GROUP INCLUDED A TRINIDAD </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AS WELL AS SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES OF </p><p>THE MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY (MAC).  OTHER COUNTRIES </p><p>REPRESENTED INCLUDED MALAYSIA, NIGERIA, PAKISTAN, SUDAN, </p><p>SYRIA, AND SPAIN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MEDIA: GOOD COVERAGE, BUT WANDERING DISCUSSIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>10.  MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES WERE VISIBLE DURING ALL </p><p>PROCEEDINGS, WITH SAUDI TELEVISION PROVIDING LIVE </p><p>COVERAGE OF SEVERAL SESSIONS AS WELL AS NUMEROUS </p><p>INTERVIEWS WITH CONVENTION ATTENDEES.  LOCAL PRESS </p><p>COVERAGE WAS SIMILARLY COMPLETE, WITH LONG QUOTES FROM A </p><p>NUMBER OF PANELISTS APPEARING IN SEVERAL ARABIC DAILIES. </p><p>FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WERE NOT VISIBLE DURING MOST OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE, ALTHOUGH THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PRINTED </p><p>MATERIAL AND TRANSLATION SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE WILL </p><p>PROBABLY HELP TO DISSEMINATE CONFERENCE RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  DISCUSSION OF GULF CRISIS MEDIA COVERAGE WAS </p><p>SOMEWHAT LESS THAN EXCELLENT, HOWEVER, AS PANELISTS OFTEN </p><p>CONTRADICTED THEMSELVES AND ONE ANOTHER ABOUT THE BEST </p><p>WAY TO RESPOND TO IRAQI PROPAGANDA.  SPECULATIONS BY A </p><p>NUMBER OF PANELISTS ABOUT THE SOURCES OF SADDAM\'S SUPPORT </p><p>IN OTHER COUNTRIES WERE INCONCLUSIVE, AS WERE DISCUSSIONS </p><p>REGARDING THE OVERALL ROLE OF ARAB AND WESTERN MEDIA IN </p><p>THE CRISIS (REPORTED SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE HOLDING OF THE CONVENTION MAY ITSELF PROVE TO BE </p><p>ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT RESULT OVER THE LONG TERM.  WHILE </p><p>FURTHER EVALUATION OF THE CONVENTION\'S IMPORT WILL TAKE </p><p>SOME TIME TO EMERGE, ATTENDANCE BY SUCH A WIDE RANGE OF </p><p>SAUDI LUMINARIES COULD HAVE POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR </p><p>FUTURE PUBLIC DEBATE OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES, </p><p>PERHAPS EVEN BEYOND THE END OF SADDAM\'S WAR.  MOREOVER, </p><p>DECISIONS TO HOLD THE CONVENTION IN RIYADH AND CONVENE A </p><p>NUMBER OF PANELS ON NON-RELIGIOUS THEMES MADE FOR FAR </p><p>MORE INTERESTING DISCUSSION THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE </p><p>IN THE MORE TYPICAL CONFERENCE VENUES OF MECCA OR MEDINA. </p><p> </p><p>FREEMAN </p><p></p></div>
