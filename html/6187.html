Summary: On February 11, Save the Children-UK (SCF) issued </p><p>its third Binga District Nutrition Survey in which they </p><p>reported a slight increase in the prevalence of acute </p><p>malnutrition among children aged </p><p>6 -59 months.  The increase was not enough for malnutrition </p><p>among pre-school aged children in the district to reach </p><p>emergency levels. Mortality rates for both children under the </p><p>age of five and the total population were within acceptable </p><p>levels, contradicting numerous reports of death by starvation </p><p>throughout the district over the last several months. The </p><p>survey does show how HIV/AIDS has negatively affected the </p><p>community over the last year and increased food insecurity </p><p>among the vulnerable population.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Worsening Nutrition </p><p>------------------- </p><p>2. On February 11, Save the Children-UK (SCF) issued its </p><p>third Binga District Nutrition Survey (the first was </p><p>conducted in December 2001 and the second in April 2002) in </p><p>which they reported a slight increase in the prevalence of </p><p>acute malnutrition among children aged 6 - 59 months.  The </p><p>objective of the survey was to estimate the prevalence of </p><p>acute malnutrition and assess the changes in malnutrition </p><p>levels.  The survey covered all 21 wards in Binga and </p><p>presented weight and height measurement data on 933 randomly </p><p>selected children. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Binga is one of the most isolated and least developed </p><p>districts in Zimbabwe and was the site of heated discussions </p><p>between the Government and SCF about food aid politicization </p><p>last October.  Food deliveries in Binga were blocked on two </p><p>separate occasions, leaving the district without general food </p><p>distribution for two months, although the Catholic church </p><p>school feeding program continued. On October, 4 local </p><p>authorities ordered Save the Children U.K. to halt food </p><p>distribution, five months after previously having forced the </p><p>Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) to stop </p><p>distribution efforts in the same town. (The Catholic church </p><p>feeding program was later resumed by a different church </p><p>entity in advance of SCF\'s problems. See Reftels) </p><p> </p><p>4.  As reported in ReftelB, SCF was just resuming food </p><p>distributions in December, after a Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>imposed, two and a half month suspension, and was preparing </p><p>to feed the entire population of Binga (120,000 people </p><p>according to the 2002 census results). Catholic Development </p><p>Commission (CADEC) was providing supplementary feeding to </p><p>63,000 children aged 6 months to 12 years and 2000 pregnant </p><p>women. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Global acute malnutrition among pre-school aged children, </p><p>measured by a decrease in the weight for height index and the </p><p>presence of edema, worsened from April 2002 from 3.5 percent </p><p>to 4.2 percent but was still within the acceptable range for </p><p>malnutrition.  Chronic malnutrition or stunting increased to </p><p>33.2 percent from 29.5 percent indicating that one-third of </p><p>children are subjected to prolonged food deficits resulting </p><p>in compromised physical development. Children not receiving </p><p>SCF general food rations were 3.4 times more likely to be </p><p>acutely malnourished. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>HIV/AIDS Likely Cause of Deaths </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>6.  The crude mortality rate and the mortality rate for </p><p>children under five were considered normal, debunking </p><p>speculation that Binga had suffered widespread deaths by </p><p>starvation.  After an examination of the demographic </p><p>characteristics of the sampled households, one can infer that </p><p>the primary causes of death during the three months preceding </p><p>the survey were malaria and HIV/AIDS-related illnesses. </p><p>(Note: The survey period coincided with the beginning of </p><p>malaria season. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  The demographic composition of the survey sample was </p><p>consistent with a community suffering from high levels of </p><p>HIV/AIDS infection.  Orphans were 8.2 percent of the surveyed </p><p>children, up from 4.8 percent in April.  Of this 8.2 percent, </p><p>2.3 percent had lost a mother only and 5.6 percent a father. </p><p>There was a decrease in the percentage of female-headed </p><p>households from 22.9 to 14.4 percent, which could be </p><p>attributed to a decline in male migrational labor.  There was </p><p>one child-headed household, whereas the previous survey </p><p>reported none.  Households headed by an elderly person </p><p>comprised 28 percent of respondents and households with </p><p>either a chronically ill decision maker or other adult male </p><p>comprised two percent of respondents. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Comment: This nutrition survey is a good assessment of </p><p>the effect of SCF program on children aged 6 - 59 months. </p><p>The sample selection appears to have been random and </p><p>relatively free of bias and thus is a good representation of </p><p>pre-school aged children.  The results show that although </p><p>malnutrition levels have increased, those receiving SCF food </p><p>aid are doing much better than those who do not, even though </p><p>94 percent of children under five are also receiving CADEC </p><p>supplementary food.  The survey is also good in that it </p><p>provides a snapshot of how disease is affecting this </p><p>chronically food insecure community.  SCF will conduct </p><p>another survey to assess ongoing needs during the upcoming </p><p>April/May harvest. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Comment continued: Unfortunately, one cannot extrapolate </p><p>the results of this survey to the larger population receiving </p><p>SCF food because the sample size does not reflect the </p><p>population being fed by SCF. A growing body of literature is </p><p>recognizing that using pre-school aged children as proxy </p><p>indicators for the nutritional status for the entire </p><p>population does not provide an accurate picture of </p><p>malnutrition in a community.  School-age children and adults </p><p>could well exhibit higher levels of malnutrition because they </p><p>are not receiving CADEC supplementary food in addition to the </p><p>SCF rations.  Also, adults, particularly mothers, may be </p><p>forfeiting some of their food to ensure that their children </p><p>are getting enough to eat.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
