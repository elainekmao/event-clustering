O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, EFIN, ETRD, AMGT, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Almost No Fuel </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 2544 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary:  Short of foreign exchange and shunned by </p><p>Libya, this country is virtually running on empty. </p><p>Doggedly patient Zimbabweans wait days in mile-long fuel </p><p>lines that meander over and around city blocks.  The </p><p>roads have lost 75 percent of normal traffic, as the </p><p>Government cannot muster the daily US$ 1 million it needs </p><p>to meet fuel demand at present pricing levels.  We </p><p>believe the world\'s worst performing peacetime economy is </p><p>lurching toward meltdown.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Negotiations with Libyans fall through </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Zimbabwe has entered a cycle of recurring fuel </p><p>shortages each 2-3 weeks, with every successive crisis </p><p>more punishing than the last.  The Government has scant </p><p>export earnings to draw upon, the consequence of an </p><p>official exchange rate that overvalues the Zimdollar by </p><p>30-fold, land redistribution that has destroyed a robust </p><p>farm sector, tax policies that siphon nearly 100 percent </p><p>of company earnings, and price controls that induce </p><p>critical shortages.  Negotiations with Libyan parastatal </p><p>Tamoil, provider of most Zimbabwean fuel this year, broke </p><p>down on Saturday.  Reportedly, the Libyans now want hard </p><p>currency rather than theoretical stakes in theoretical </p><p>assets.  A U.S. company rep told us the GOZ is trying to </p><p>avoid purchasing fuel again from Kuwait-based IPG, which </p><p>specializes in high-risk customers and has been charging </p><p>the GOZ 20-40 percent over the international price.  More </p><p>conventional suppliers are cheaper but demand full </p><p>prepayment from the credit-poor GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>What Now? </p><p>--------- </p><p>3. (U) President Mugabe has few options.  He can: </p><p> </p><p>a) implore Libya not to let a fellow-African nation that </p><p>has challenged the West go under. </p><p> </p><p>b) sell or trade remaining national assets for hard </p><p>currency. </p><p> </p><p>c) print a fresh supply of Zimdollars to exchange for </p><p>hard currency on parallel markets, causing the Zimdollar </p><p>to resume its free-fall. </p><p> </p><p>d) stop subsidizing fuel by over 90 percent. </p><p> </p><p>e) unshackle the export sector by devaluing the official </p><p>exchange rate, reversing land redistribution or reducing </p><p>taxes. </p><p> </p><p>(a-c) are quick fixes that win Mugabe no more than a few </p><p>weeks breathing room; (d) will prove unpopular and </p><p>trigger hyperinflation; (e) may be ideologically </p><p>unpalatable. </p><p> </p><p>The Threat to U.S. Interests </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU) At the weekend\'s party conference, Mugabe said </p><p>he might nationalize foreign oil companies, a contingency </p><p>we have warned of (ref) but one that, at the end of the </p><p>day, does not address the forex/fuel problem.  U.S. </p><p>companies believe the GOZ will channel an increasing </p><p>share of the subsidized fuel to indigenous operators, </p><p>eventually pressuring multinationals into asset fire </p><p>sales.  At present, indigenous operators have 7 percent </p><p>of distribution capacity but are receiving 30 percent of </p><p>incoming fuel. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (U) Even Zimbabwe\'s still-vibrant informal economy </p><p>cannot run without fuel.  Unless the GOZ modifies its </p><p>scorched-earth policies, the economy will continue to </p><p>retract by over 1 percent per month, its foreign exchange </p><p>shortfall growing more pronounced at every turn. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
