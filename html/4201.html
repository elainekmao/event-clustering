<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 007921 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, TU, POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: AK PARTY\'S LANDSLIDE VICTORY SWEEPS ASIDE </p><p>DISCREDITED PARTY LEADERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 7766 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 6880 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: After crushing defeat by AK in Nov. 3 </p><p>elections, leaders of MHP, ANAP, and DYP, all of which failed </p><p>to reenter Parliament, separately declared their intent to </p><p>vacate their party chairmanships.  With P.M. Ecevit\'s </p><p>pre-election announcement that he will leave DSP leadership </p><p>in April 2003, these resignations -- assuming they hold -- </p><p>mark a significant watershed in Turkish politics.  Whether </p><p>any of these parties can rebuild into a credible alternative </p><p>to AK remains an open question, but to be successful, any </p><p>center-right party must represent, and act on, Anatolian </p><p>interests.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>House-cleaning </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In wake of the overwhelming election victory of R. </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan\'s Islam-influenced Justice and Development </p><p>(AK) Party (ref A), demoralized leaders of Turkey\'s </p><p>Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and center-right Motherland </p><p>(ANAP) and True Path (DYP) parties have signaled their </p><p>intention to step aside.  Even before the Supreme Election </p><p>Board (YSK) had finished counting the ballots evening of Nov. </p><p>3, right-wing MHP leader Devlet Bahceli publicly accepted </p><p>personal responsibility for his party\'s defeat and announced </p><p>that he would not run for the MHP chairmanship at the </p><p>extraordinary party congress to be held in early 2003 (ref </p><p>A).  Nov. 4 Tansu Ciller, whose DYP narrowly missed the 10% </p><p>national vote threshold to enter Parliament, issued a written </p><p>statement that she would summon a party congress and would </p><p>not be a candidate for leader.  ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz </p><p>subsequently declared that "in order to clear the path for a </p><p>restructuring of the center-right," he will soon quit both </p><p>ANAP and active politics.  ANAP is expected to hold a </p><p>convention in Dec. to pick a new chairman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Comment: Cold Weather Coming On </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The resignations, unprecedented in Turkish political </p><p>history, illustrate the size of the AK victory and its effect </p><p>on the current political class, which is beginning to </p><p>recognize for the first time the need to renew itself...or at </p><p>least to appear to be doing so. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Some of the resignees might seek to emulate opposition </p><p>leader Deniz Baykal, who resigned his Republican People\'s </p><p>Party (CHP) chairmanship after its disastrous showing in the </p><p>1999 elections but left enough of his supporters in key party </p><p>positions to ensure his eventual resurrection as party </p><p>leader.  Whether any could succeed is an open question. </p><p>Ciller would face a challenge by former diplomat and </p><p>presidential foreign policy advisor Mehmet Ali Bayar, who has </p><p>the backing of former President Suleyman Demirel, DYP\'s </p><p>founder.  For his part, Bahceli would be confronted with an </p><p>angry and hostile party machine that sees him as soft on </p><p>existential MHP principles and as an idiosyncratic </p><p>personality unsuited for leadership (ref B).  For ANAP, the </p><p>tasks confronting any pretender to Yilmaz\' vacated throne are </p><p>even more daunting.  A successor must deal expeditiously with </p><p>those Yilmaz cronies who undoubtedly will try to stick </p><p>around, even as he struggles to salvage an ANAP -- which, </p><p>unlike DYP and MHP, appears to have lost its core support to </p><p>AK -- on the verge of extinction.  Similarly, the Democratic </p><p>Left Party (DSP), for decades the personal vehicle of the </p><p>Ecevits, is -- like its leader -- heading toward political </p><p>oblivion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Bottom line: Turkey remains a predominantly </p><p>conservative center-right country with a clear sense of </p><p>Muslim identity, however variegated.  In short, the voices of </p><p>Anatolia, whether in the greater urban sprawl of Istanbul or </p><p>the heartland "Green Belt", will insist on being heard.  To </p><p>flourish in the longer run, therefore, any revived or new </p><p>center-right party will, like AK, have to represent Anatolian </p><p>realities and aspirations. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
