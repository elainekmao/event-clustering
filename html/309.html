<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 PRAGUE 08144 </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USEC - AMBASSADOR NILES </p><p>DEPT PASS TO ERIKA SCHLAGER CSCE COMMISSION </p><p>USIA FOR EU (OLASON, PENDERGRAST, JORIA); INFO DD </p><p>(KNOPP), C(PISTOR) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, CSCE, PGOV, PREL, CZ </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATIONS IN PRAGUE AND OTHER </p><p>         CZECHOSLOVAK CITIES NOVEMBER 20 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  THE PRAGUE </p><p>DEMONSTRATION OF NOVEMBER 20, AT MORE THAN 150,000 </p><p>PEOPLE, WAS THE LARGEST YET.  POLICE MADE NO ATTEMPT </p><p>TO INTERVENE OTHER THAN TO CLOSE BRIDGES TO PREVENT </p><p>THE CROWD FROM MARCHING ON PRAGUE CASTLE. </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS ALSO OCCURRED IN SEVERAL OTHER </p><p>CITIES, INCLUDING BRATISLAVA.  MEDIA COVERAGE </p><p>REMAINED MIXED, WITH "RUDE PRAVO" HOSTILE, </p><p>"SVOBODNE SLOVO" FAVORABLE AND TELEVISION </p><p>COVERAGE POSITIVE -- OR AT LEAST OBJECTIVE. </p><p>WHETHER AS A THOUGHTOUT PLAN OR THE RESULT OF </p><p>LEADERSHIP DISAGREEMENTS, THE REGIME SEEMS TO </p><p>HAVE ADOPTED A CARROT AND STICK STRATEGY, WITH </p><p>SOME CONCILIATORY GESTURES AND A PROMISE OF AT </p><p>LEAST ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS COMBINED WITH A </p><p>NONE-TOO-VEILED WARNING OF SUPPRESSION IF THINGS </p><p>REMAIN OUT OF HAND.  IT ALSO IS CONTINUING ITS </p><p>EFFORTS TO TAINT DEMONSTRATORS WITH CHARGES OF </p><p>WORKING FOR FOREIGN INTERESTS.  IT CANNOT HAVE </p><p>BEEN PLEASED, HOWEVER, BY A SOVIET PRESS SPOKESMAN </p><p>STATEMENT THAT DESCRIBED THE DEMONSTRATIONS AS </p><p>PART OF THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN EASTERN </p><p>EUROPE.  IN ANOTHER PRESUMABLE REACTION TO THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS, GDR LEADER KRENZ HAS CANCELLED </p><p>HIS VISIT TO PRAGUE.  (NOTE:  AS THIS CABLE GOES </p><p>TO PRESS, CZECH REPUBLIC GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN </p><p>KASIK ANNOUNCED THAT AN INVESTIGATION WOULD BE </p><p>OPENED ON THE EVENTS OF NOVEMBER 17 AND WHETHER </p><p>THE POLICE USED DISPROPORTIONATE FORCE.  END NOTE.) </p><p>END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE DEMONSTRATION DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON </p><p>AND EVENING YESTERDAY, NOVEMBER 20, WAS THE LARGEST YET. </p><p>THE COMMUNIST PARTY DAILY "RUDE </p><p>PRAVO" ADMITTED TO 150,000 PEOPLE, BUT EMBOFFS PRESENT </p><p>THOUGHT IT CLOSER TO 200,000.  THE CROWD GATHERED </p><p>SLOWLY DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND DISPERSED </p><p>GRADUALLY IN THE EVENING.  A LAST GROUP OF SEVERAL </p><p>THOUSAND STOOD OUTSIDE CZECHOSLOVAK RADIO AT ABOUT </p><p>10:00 P.M. AND THEN WENT HOME.  POLICE MADE NO EFFORT </p><p>TO INTERFERE WITH THE CROWD AS LONG AS IT STAYED WITHIN </p><p>THE "GOLDEN CROSS" AREA  OF WENCESLAS SQUARE AND </p><p>NATIONAL AVENUE.  SECURITY FORCES DID CLOSE OFF THE </p><p>BRIDGES GOING ACROSS THE RIVER TO PREVENT THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS FROM TRYING TO MARCH ON PRAGUE CASTLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE DEMONSTRATION APPEARED TO BE UNORGANIZED AND </p><p>LEADERLESS, AND WHILE THERE HAS BEEN NO CALL FOR A </p><p>GATHERING TODAY ONE IS GENERALLY EXPECTED.  OTHER </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS OCCURRED THE SAME DAY OUTSIDE PRAGUE. </p><p>THESE INCLUDED BRNO (AN ESTIMATED 30,000 IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL SQUARE), OLOMOUC (6,000), TEPLICE (1,000), </p><p>LIBEREC AND OSTRAVA.  THEATERS AND SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED </p><p>IN CESKE BUDEJOVICE, AS WELL AS PRAGUE -- WHERE </p><p>PERFORMERS TALKED POLITICS WITH ANY AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO </p><p>SHOWED UP.  DEMONSTRATIONS ALSO TOOK PLACE IN </p><p>BRATISLAVA, BUT WE HAVE HEARD OF NO OTHERS IN SLOVAKIA. </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS IN MANY OF THESE PLACES VOICED THE </p><p>ANTI-GOVERNMENT AND ANTI-COMMUNIST DEMANDS HEARD IN </p><p>PRAGUE, INCLUDING SUCH SLOGANS AS "JAKES IN THE </p><p>WASTEBASKET."  TELEVISION NEWS REPORTS SAID THAT </p><p>THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF DISTURBANCES IN OTHER PRINCIPAL </p><p>CITIES SUCH AS PLZEN AND HRADEC KRALOVE, AND </p><p>CONDEMNED THE NOVEMBER 17 POLICE BRUTALITY. </p><p> </p><p>REGIME REACTION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE ONLY REGIME FIGURE TO ADDRESS THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS DIRECTLY IN WENCESLAS SQUARE WAS VASIL </p><p>MOHORITA, CHAIRMAN OF THE SOCIALIST UNION OF YOUTH </p><p>(SSM).  HE MADE SEVERAL POINTS THAT HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN </p><p>HIS ORGANIZATION\'S STATEMENT PUBLISHED IN "MLADA FRONTA" </p><p>THE DAY BEFORE (PRAGUE 8106), IN WHICH HE SUPPORTED </p><p>THE STUDENTS, AND HE SAID THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE ANY </p><p>PROSECUTION OF STUDENTS ARRESTED ON NOVEMBER 17 AND </p><p>WOULD RESIGN IF THERE WERE PROSECUTIONS.  (COMMENT: </p><p>WE REMAIN SUSPICIOUS THAT MOHORITA\'S COMMENTS ARE </p><p>MORE AN EFFORT TO COOPT THE STUDENTS THAN TO SUPPORT </p><p>THEIR DEMANDS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  THE CPCZ PRESIDIUM HELD A SPECIAL SESSION </p><p>DURING THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER 20 TO TRY TO DEAL </p><p>WITH THE SITUATION  AND WITH "EXPRESSIONS OF INTENSE </p><p>CONCERN" BY VARIOUS PARTY AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p>IT REJECTED STUDENT APPEALS FOR A GENERAL STRIKE </p><p>NOVEMBER 27 AND CALLED ON STUDENTS TO RETURN TO CLASS </p><p>AND ARTISTS TO RETURN TO WORK.  IT ALSO REPORTEDLY </p><p>DISCUSSED PRACTICAL STEPS FOR RESTORING ORDER, AND </p><p>SUPPORTED A JOINT STATEMENT RELEASED BY THE FEDERAL, </p><p>CZECH AND SLOVAK GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THIS STATEMENT, ENTITLED "DIALOGUE YES, </p><p>CONFRONTATION NO," INSISTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAD BEEN STRIVING FOR SOCIAL RESTRUCTURING AND </p><p>DEMOCRACY AS WELL AS IMPROVING LIVING STANDARDS, </p><p>GOING INTO SOME DETAIL ON THE LATTER POINT.  IT </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE CURRENT DISTURBANCES </p><p>SINCE THESE "ONLY PLAY INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO </p><p>OPPOSE RESTRUCTURING."  THE GOVERNMENT WANTED A </p><p>DIALOGUE AND A POLITICAL SOLUTION OF EXISTING </p><p>PROBLEMS, BUT SUCH A SOLUTION "CANNOT BE FOUND IN </p><p>AN ATMOSPHERE OF EMOTION AND ANTI-SOCIALIST </p><p>MANIFESTATIONS."  WHILE THE GOVERNMENT "DID NOT WANT </p><p>TO GO VIA A PATH OF CONFRONTATION WHICH THE ANTI- </p><p>SOCIALIST ELEMENTS ARE TRYING TO FORCE ON US," IT COULD </p><p>NOT AGREE TO THE VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE </p><p>LAWS OF THE LAND OR "WATCH HELPLESSLY ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>THOSE GROUPS WHICH ACT AT VARIANCE WITH THE </p><p>CZECHOSLOVAK LEGAL ORDER AND ARE INCITED FROM ABROAD." </p><p>THUS ALL THREE GOVERNMENTS SUPPORTED THE MEASURES </p><p>WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN TO KEEP ORDER.  (COMMENT: </p><p>PRESUMABLY A REFERENCE TO SUPPRESSION OF THE NOVEMBER 17 </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS AND A WARNING THAT SUCH ACTION COULD </p><p>COME AGAIN IF NEEDED.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) PRAGUE CITY PARTY CHAIRMAN MIROSLAV STEPAN, </p><p>MEANWHILE, MET WITH CPCZ PARTY WORKERS OF THE MAJOR </p><p>PRAGUE ENTERPRISES NOVEMBER 20 TO RALLY SUPPORT IN </p><p>A PROBABLE EFFORT TO HEAD OFF A NOVEMBER 27 GENERAL </p><p>STRIKE.  HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNISTS </p><p>NOT BEING NEUTRAL IN THE CURRENT EVENTS AND TO OPPOSE </p><p>THOSE FORCES WHO WANTED ALL OR NOTHING (I.E., WHO WERE </p><p>NOT INTERESTED IN DIALOGUE OR COMPROMISE) AND STAND </p><p>FIRM AGAINST EVENTS NOW GOING ON IN THE CITY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) IN A REACTION FROM THE SOVIET UNION, SOVIET </p><p>PRESS SPOKESMAN GERASIMOV WAS SHOWN ON CZECHOSLOVAK </p><p>TELEVISION SAYING THAT THE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE AN </p><p>INTERNAL MATTER FOR CZECHOSLOVAKIA, BUT THAT THEY </p><p>REPRESENTED A PART OF THE CURRENT PROCESS OF </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION IN EASTERN EUROPE.  PRESUMABLY IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO EVENTS IN PRAGUE, GRD LEADER KRENZ </p><p>CANCELLED HIS NOVEMBER 21 VISIT TO PRAGUE AFTER </p><p>MUTUAL AGREEMENT WITH THE GOC. </p><p> </p><p>MEDIA REACTION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) "RUDE PRAVO" IS STICKING TO A LINE CRITICAL OF </p><p>THE DEMONSTRATORS, PUBLISHING INTERVIEWS WITH WORKERS </p><p>AND PARTY MEMBERS HOSTILE TO THE DEMONSTRATIONS AND </p><p>SUGGESTING THAT SOME OF THE ORGANIZERS OF THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS ARE NOT STUDENTS.  IT LIMITED ITS </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS TO PRAGUE AND BRNO, </p><p>WITHOUT MENTIONING THAT ANY HAD TAKEN PLACE </p><p>ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) THE SOCIALIST PARTY PAPER "SVOBODNE SLOVO," </p><p>HOWEVER, REMAINED GENERALLY SYMPATHETIC TO THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS (PRAGUE 8106).  IT ALSO REPORTED </p><p>THAT 400 JOURNALISTS HAD MET NOVEMBER 20 AND </p><p>REJECTED THE POLICE ACTIONS ON NOVEMBER 17, AS WELL AS </p><p>MAINTENANCE OF THE LEADING ROLE OF THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY.  THE JOURNALISTS SUPPORTED THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED </p><p>INDEPENDENT CIVIC FORUM (PRAGUE 8108) AND CALLED UPON </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CZECH JOURNALISTS\' UNION TO DO </p><p>THE SAME OR RESIGN.  THEY ALSO CREATED AN OFFICIAL </p><p>GROUP OF INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) CZECHOSLOVAK TELEVISION COVERAGE WAS GENERALLY </p><p>POSITIVE, OR AT LEAST OBJECTIVE.  IN ADDITION TO </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS IN PRAGUE AND OTHER </p><p>CITIES, THERE WERE INTERVIEWS WITH THE STUDENTS AND </p><p>OTHER DEMONSTRATORS, GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO PRESENT </p><p>THEIR VIEWS TO A NATIONAL AUDIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>BLACK </p><p></p></div>
