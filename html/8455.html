HARARE 250 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Although the Tsvangirai treason trial was brief during </p><p>the week of May 27 - 30, possibly in anticipation of the MDC </p><p>planned mass action, on May 29, the Deputy Canadian High </p><p>Commissioner informed us that according to Ottawa </p><p>intelligence sources, the prosecution intended to introduce </p><p>"Edward Simms" as a surprise witness in the coming days. </p><p>Simms attended the Montreal meeting; the State alleges he is </p><p>a CIA agent but has kept other details of his identity </p><p>secret.  Bringing him forward now suggests the State is more </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>desperate to prove its case.  Justice Paddington Garwe ruled </p><p>that Brigadier Bonyongwe could not be compelled to answer </p><p>questions on the operations of the CIO, but should answer </p><p>questions on his role in the destruction of the payment </p><p>vouchers.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Surprise State Witness? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) On May 29, the Deputy Canadian High Commissioner </p><p>informed us that according to Ottawa intelligence sources, </p><p>the prosecution intended to introduce a surprise witness this </p><p>week, and Ottawa suspected the witness to be the heretofore </p><p>not-clearly-identified "Edward Simms".  (Note:  According to </p><p>the State\'s star witness Ari Ben Menashe, the leader of the </p><p>Montreal meeting depicted on the video tape is "Edward </p><p>Simms", an employee of the CIA.  The defense has published an </p><p>artist\'s rendering of "Simms" based on the grainy video in an </p><p>attempt to identify him.  End Note.)  By June 2, however, the </p><p>State had not produced Simms.  (It is also possible that the </p><p>State intends another "surprise" unrelated to Simms to </p><p>bolster its case.) </p><p> </p><p>Judge Issues Diplomatic Ruling </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Also on May 29, Justice Paddington Garwe ruled that </p><p>the certificate issued by Nicholas Goche, Minister of State </p><p>Security - claiming that information on the operations of the </p><p>Central Intelligence Organization was privileged - was valid </p><p>(Ref A).  Garwe did note, however, that the certificate could </p><p>not exempt Brigadier Bonyongwe from answering questions on </p><p>his role in the destruction of the payment vouchers.  Garwe </p><p>did not think that the questions Advocate Bizos asked </p><p>Bonyongwe regarding the vouchers would reveal the operations </p><p>of the CIO. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to defense attorney Innocent Chagonda, </p><p>although Garwe had given the defense team permission to ask </p><p>Bonyongwe about the vouchers, some of the questions they </p><p>wanted to ask about the payments did pertain to the </p><p>operations of the CIO.  Chagonda believed it would still be </p><p>difficult to ask Bonyongwe questions about the vouchers. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) The CIA has confirmed that Simms is not an employee. </p><p>As such his bona fides are questionable, and it is unclear </p><p>what value to the State he would be as a witness.  We presume </p><p>his arrival was delayed and he still may come in the coming </p><p>days.  It would appear the State was reluctant to bring him </p><p>forward, or he personally did not want to come forward </p><p>previously.  Either way, that he now may appear suggests the </p><p>State is taking more desperate measures to prove its case. </p><p>Garwe appears to have made a diplomatic decision on the </p><p>certificate issued by Minister Goche to appease both parties </p><p>- he upheld it, but also stated that the defense could </p><p>proceed with their questioning.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
