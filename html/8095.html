<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003225 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/ESC, IO/UNP, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA </p><p>EUCOM FOR J3, J5 AND POLAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ETTC, IZ, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT OFFICIALS ON IRAQ SANCTIONS LIFT RESOLUTION, </p><p>TURKISH TRADE  OUTSIDE OF OFF (SBU) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 122029 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 3055 </p><p>     C. STATE 104141 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 3190 </p><p>     E. ANKARA 3058 </p><p>     F. ANKARA 3156 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Stuart Brown </p><p>for reasons 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Senior MFA officials and the Energy Minister </p><p>reacted </p><p>positively to demarches by the Ambassador and others on the </p><p>UN Security </p><p>Council draft Iraq sanctions lift resolution.  However, other </p><p>MFA and </p><p>Foreign Trade officials stressed the GOT\'s strong view that </p><p>all pending, </p><p>signed contracts under the Oil for Food Program, not just </p><p>those approved </p><p>and funded by the UN, should be implemented.  They also </p><p>reacted negatively </p><p>to the proposal to cut the proportion of oil proceeds to be </p><p>dedicated to </p><p>compensation claims.  Foreign Trade acknowledged that about </p><p>USD 500 </p><p>million in annual trade took place under a bilateral MOU with </p><p>the former </p><p>GOI, all outside OFF.  The MFA\'s spokesperson on May 15 </p><p>publicly called for lifting sanctions on Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Following up on ref E demarche, Ambassador asked </p><p>Energy </p><p>Minister Guler for Turkish support for the US-UK-Spanish </p><p>Sanctions </p><p>Lift Resolution at the UN Security Council (Ref D).  Also, </p><p>Acting </p><p>DCM raised the issue with MFA Deputy U/S Kilic, and Dep </p><p>PolmilCouns </p><p>did the same with MFA\'s Americas department.  Guler and MFA </p><p>officials </p><p>reacted positively, and promised to discuss the issue further </p><p>within </p><p>their government.  The Ambassador also raised the resolution </p><p>with </p><p>MFA Undersecretary Ugur Ziyal May 13, emphasizing that if the </p><p>Turks </p><p>want to improve the bilateral relationship, they must take </p><p>concrete </p><p>actions to show support for our larger objectives (ref F). </p><p>One such </p><p>action would be a strong public statement supporting our </p><p>efforts in </p><p>New York, and actively lobbying other UNSC members to push </p><p>for approval </p><p>of the resolution.  Ziyal took the message on board and said </p><p>he would </p><p>discuss with others. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Other MFA and Foreign Trade officials were less </p><p>forthcoming.  Econoff </p><p>met with Tevfik Mengu, Director General for Agreements at the </p><p>Foreign Trade Undersecretariat, on May 13, and with Akif </p><p>Ayhan, Head of Department in MFA,s </p><p>Bilateral Economic Affairs Division, on May 14, to deliver </p><p>ref A points. </p><p>On the relationship of the UNSC resolution to the Oil for </p><p>Food (OFF) Program </p><p>and MFA,s recent nonpaper on this subject (ref B), Econoff </p><p>maintained that </p><p>the resolution would maintain the UN SYG,s authority to </p><p>prioritize OFF </p><p>contracts and would provide for implementation of </p><p>previously-approved/ </p><p>funded OFF contracts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Both Mengu and Ayhan maintained that all OFF contracts </p><p>signed by </p><p>the former Iraqi government, not just those approved/funded </p><p>by the UN, </p><p>should be implemented and that all should be given high </p><p>priority.  They </p><p>presented Econoff with the following statistics on Turkey,s </p><p>pending OFF </p><p>contracts: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Total:  USD 1.9 billion; </p><p>-- Approved by UN (not all are funded):  USD 1.3 billion; </p><p>-- Approved/funded by UN:  USD 196 million (308 contracts); </p><p>-- "Priority" contracts for food, medicine, hospital </p><p>construction (not </p><p>all are approved, funded):  USD 660 million; </p><p>-- Food contracts (not all approved, funded):  USD 220 </p><p>million. </p><p>5. (C) They also commented that the allocation of five </p><p>percent of oil </p><p>proceeds to the UN Compensation Commission was insufficient </p><p>to address </p><p>outstanding compensation claims.  Both asked for further </p><p>details as to how non-approved/funded OFF contracts would be </p><p>handled under the resolution, </p><p>and more broadly, how the Iraqi Assistance Fund would operate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) In a public statement issued May 15, MFA called for </p><p>removal of sanctions </p><p>on Iraq, and for UN Security Council action to create a </p><p>framework for </p><p>international cooperation in Iraq.  MFA noted the importance </p><p>of protecting </p><p>the rights of Turkish companies which had won contracts under </p><p>OFF.  PM Erdogan\'s foreign policy advisor told us May 15 that </p><p>the PM would not be echoing the MFA statement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  In an earlier meeting May 8 on Turkish-Iraqi trade </p><p>pursuant to ref C , </p><p>Mengu said that Turkey,s Memorandum of Understanding with </p><p>the GOI governed </p><p>bilateral trade worth USD 500 million annually over the last </p><p>several years, </p><p>all outside the OFF Program.  This trade took the form of a </p><p>barter of Iraqi </p><p>oil for Turkish consumer and industrial goods.  Turkey owes </p><p>Iraq about USD </p><p>250 million in goods under this arrangement, and intends to </p><p>negotiate payment </p><p>in goods when the new Iraqi administration is ready to </p><p>discuss this matter. </p><p>On the issue of a second border crossing with Iraq, Mengu </p><p>stated flatly that </p><p>the Habur crossing, with a capacity of 1500 trucks daily in </p><p>both directions, </p><p>is not fully utilized.  He opined that there is no need for a </p><p>second crossing. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
