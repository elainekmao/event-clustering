<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001381 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, </p><p>CA/OCS/NEASA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/IP/NEA, DSERCC, AND M </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 03/23/13 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, KHLS, PTER, PREL, EAID, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01 (EAC): ABU DHABI SITREP NO. 4, MARCH 23 </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABU DHABI 1365 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) COM convened Abu Dhabi\'s Iraq Task Force/core </p><p>Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, 3/23. </p><p>Embassy Abu Dhabi, FCS (located outside of the Embassy </p><p>compound), and the USGS office in Al Ain are open 3/23 with </p><p>full staffing. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The Consular Section is open for American Citizen </p><p>Services today and will resume visa services on 3/24.  The </p><p>American community here has remained calm; CONS has not </p><p>received a single call from worried AMCITs.  In contrast, </p><p>consular officers from other Western embassies in Abu Dhabi </p><p>have reported a high level of anxiety among their citizenry </p><p>since the onset of hostilities.  Most embassies here </p><p>released a travel warning only after the military action in </p><p>Iraq had begun.  CONS posited that our outreach program of </p><p>warden messages and travel warnings prior to the war kept </p><p>the American community informed about the situation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) American business community contacts report no </p><p>significant exodus from the UAE of private American </p><p>citizens or U.S. companies located here. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>UAEG Actions/Statements </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) POL noted that the new Speaker of the UAE\'s </p><p>parliamentary Federal National Council publicly announced </p><p>yesterday that the situation in Iraq is the fault of the </p><p>Iraqi leadership.  Speaker Al-Kindi said that Saddam had </p><p>been given the opportunity to leave, but had declined to </p><p>heed that good advice. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Task Force/EAC members agreed to implement random </p><p>security inspection of American and FSN employees, upon </p><p>arrival to the Embassy compound.  Those who are randomly </p><p>selected will undergo inspection of their personal and </p><p>other property by Embassy guards. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) USLO reported no incidents involving U.S. military </p><p>troops in the UAE, and reported that our forces here are </p><p>likely to move from Force Protection Condition Delta to </p><p>Charlie on 3/24. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Local Media </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) UAE Information Minister Shaykh Abdulla Bin Zayid </p><p>Al-Nahyan reportedly requested the Pan-Arab "Al-Khaleej" </p><p>Arabic daily to "tone down" its Iraq reporting.  PAO noted, </p><p>however, that "Al-Khaleej" continued to criticize the </p><p>United States and focused on Iraqi casualties of war, </p><p>carrying a full page of photographs of wounded Iraqi men, </p><p>women, and children on 3/23. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Shaykh Abdulla also told the Ambassador that all </p><p>journalists held captive in the Iraqi Information Ministry </p><p>building have been allowed to leave, but were being forced </p><p>to file their reports from the building.  According to </p><p>Shaykh Abdulla, most journalists left the building last </p><p>night for fear of their safety during the U.S. air strikes </p><p>on Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Abu Dhabi TV aired Deputy Secretary Armitage\'s </p><p>interview on 3/22 and 3/23.  Secretary Powell is expected </p><p>to appear on Abu Dhabi TV next week.  PAO noted that only </p><p>two Arab reporters -- from Abu Dhabi TV and Al-Jazeera -- </p><p>had asked questions of General Franks in yesterday\'s </p><p>CENTCOM briefing.  The Ambassador noted the importance of </p><p>placing more Arab journalists in the front rows at CENTCOM </p><p>briefings to ensure that their questions were aired.   PAO </p><p>undertook to pass this suggestion to her military </p><p>counterparts. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) PAO has updated the Embassy web page, distributed </p><p>recent statements from Administration officials, and </p><p>established an SMS text messaging service for local </p><p>journalists and UAEG officials to quickly disseminate Iraq- </p><p>related information. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Abu Dhabi Iraq Task Force/EAC will reconvene at </p><p>1000 local time, 3/24. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Iraq Task Force/EAC members in attendance included </p><p>AMB, DCM, RSO, DAO, P/M, POL, ECON, CONS, MSG, OBO, PAO, </p><p>ADMIN, USLO, FCS, FBI. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
