<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 004591 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USIA FOR EEN (DOCAL) AND R (MCINTOSH) </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE AND PA </p><p>USVIENNA FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, HR, SR, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT:  COVERAGE OF EASTERN SLAVONIA BASIC AGREEMENT </p><p>IN CROATIAN MEDIA -- REFLECTING THE AMERICAN VIEW </p><p> </p><p>1.  BECAUSE OF SOME SKEPTICISM WITHIN THE CROATIAN MEDIA </p><p>AND PUBLIC OVER THE BASIC AGREEMENT ON EASTERN SLAVONIA, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  04591  161634Z </p><p>WE INVITED FOUR COLUMNISTS FROM CROATIA\'S MAIN </p><p>NEWSPAPERS FOR A SESSION WITH AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH IN </p><p>THE HOPES OF GETTING OUR VIEWS OUT.  THE FIRST FRUITS OF </p><p>THIS DISCUSSION APPEARED TODAY (NOVEMBER 16) IN ONE OF </p><p>THOSE PAPERS, VECERNJI LIST, UNDER THE HEADLINE </p><p>"SKELETON WITHOUT THE FLESH: AMERICA\'S VIEW OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENT ON EASTERN SLAVONIA." </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOLLOWING ARE SIGNIFICANT EXCERPTS FROM THAT COLUMN, </p><p>BY FOREIGN AFFAIRS WRITER MARINA SERIC: </p><p> </p><p>(BEGIN TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>THE BASICS OF THE AGREEMENT ON EASTERN SLAVONIA CAN BE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD TO BE A SKELETON TO WHICH THE "FLESH" STILL NEEDS </p><p>TO BE ATTACHED.  IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYTHING TO GO </p><p>SMOOTHLY, FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY (LIVING) THERE TO STAY </p><p>AND FOR THOSE WHO WERE EXPELLED TO RETURN, AND FOR (EASTERN </p><p>SLAVONIA) TO BE A MULTI-ETHNIC COMMUNITY AGAIN.  THE </p><p>TRANSITIONAL AUTHORITY WILL BE A NEUTRAL FORCE THAT WILL BE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ATTACHING THE FLESH TO THE SKELETON AND FOR </p><p>EVERYTHING GOING SMOOTHLY.  THIS COULD SUMMARIZE THE </p><p>THOUGHTS ON THE BASIC AGREEMENT ABOUT EASTERN SLAVONIA FROM </p><p>THE MOUTH OF THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR PETER GALBRAITH. . . . </p><p> </p><p>"THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE THE WAR BEGAN.  THEREFORE, IT IS </p><p>LOGICAL THAT ITS END BEGIN THERE.  THAT REGION NEEDS TO </p><p>REMAIN A MULTI-ETHNIC COMMUNITY.  THIS AGREEMENT IS A BASIS </p><p>FOR THE INITIATIVES OF BOTH SIDES, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR </p><p>ITS REALIZATION.  THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD EXISTS BECAUSE IT </p><p>IS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESENT LOCAL POPULATION TO PREPARE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  04591  161634Z </p><p>ITSELF FOR NORMAL LIFE WITHIN CROATIA," EXPLAINS GALBRAITH. </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. HAS APPROACHED THIS PROBLEM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF </p><p>ITS OWN MULTI-ETHNICITY. THEREFORE ONE OF THE BASIC IDEAS IS </p><p>THAT AN AREA THAT USED TO BE MULTI-ETHNIC IN THE PAST REMAIN </p><p>MULTI-ETHNIC IN THE FUTURE.  "THERE IS STILL THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>HERE FOR THOSE WHO ARE THERE TO REMAIN, AT THE SAME TIME FOR </p><p>THOSE WHO WERE EXPELLED TO RETURN, AND FOR THE </p><p>REESTABLISHMENT OF CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THESE PEOPLES.  THAT </p><p>WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE FOR BOSNIA," CLAIMS GALBRAITH, </p><p>WHO IS CONVINCED THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT THE </p><p>AGREEMENT WILL FALL APART AND (WHO) BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN </p><p>THE INTERESTS OF ALL THAT THE TRANSITION PERIOD "PASS </p><p>SMOOTHLY, WITHOUT A MASSIVE EXODUS OF THE SERB POPULATION </p><p>AND WITHOUT INCITING NEW EMOTIONS FOR WAR." </p><p> </p><p>HE ALSO CONSIDERS THIS AGREEMENT TO BE A SIGN OF THE </p><p>MATURITY OF THE SERB NEGOTIATING TEAM, WHICH, UNLIKE THE </p><p>KNIN LEADERSHIP, UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE IN A DIFFICULT </p><p>SITUATION.  (SERB DELEGATION HEAD) MILAN MILANOVIC WAS </p><p>DESCRIBED AS AN INFLUENTIAL MAN WHO OPERATED IN THE </p><p>BACKGROUND.  "THERE WEREN\'T ANY ARGUMENTS WITHIN THE SERB </p><p>DELEGATION, AS THERE WERE IN KNIN, WHOSE LEADERSHIP SHOWED </p><p>ITSELF TO BE TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE.  THESE (PEOPLE) HAVE </p><p>LEARNED SOMETHING AND ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY.  GREAT CREDIT </p><p>MUST GO TO (CROATIAN DELEGATION CHIEF HRVOJE) SARINIC AND </p><p>HIS TEAM.  IT WAS A MATTER OF INTELLIGENT AND ELEGANT </p><p>COMPROMISES," CONCLUDED THE AMBASSADOR. </p><p> </p><p>ASKED WHETHER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ONE BETWEEN PRESIDENTS </p><p>TUDJMAN AND IZETBEGOVIC IN DAYTON WERE ONLY MASKS FOR THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  04591  161634Z </p><p>(LACK OF) SUCCESS OF NEGOTIATIONS ON BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA, </p><p>GALBRAITH SAID THAT IT IS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE, THAT THESE </p><p>SUCCESSES ARE SIGNS OF RESOLVE TO FIND A SOLUTION, AND THAT </p><p>"THE QUESTION OF BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA CANNOT BE SOLVED BEFORE </p><p>THE QUESTION OF CROATIA IS SOLVED." </p><p>THE LIFTING OF THE OTHER "WALL" -- SANCTIONS ON SERBIA -- </p><p>BEHIND WHICH LIES THE POSSIBILITY OF SERBIA\'S ACCEPTANCE </p><p>INTO EUROPEAN AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, WILL BE </p><p>TIED TO RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE PROBLEM OF </p><p>KOSOVO, AND TO COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES </p><p>TRIBUNAL IN THE HAGUE.  IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT </p><p>SIMILAR CONDITIONS APPLY ALSO FOR CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>(END TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>DAVIDSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
