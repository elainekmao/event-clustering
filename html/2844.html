THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS WERE THE END OF THE SIEGE ON </p><p>ARAFAT\'S HEADQUARTERS, ISRAEL\'S REJECTION OF THE U.N. </p><p>FACT-FINDING MISSION, AND ARAB CALLS TO EVOKE THE 7TH </p><p>ARTICLE OF THE UN CHARTER. </p><p> </p><p>A NUMBER OF EDITORIAL COLUMNISTS PRAISED THE KING\'S </p><p>ROLE IN UNDERTAKING HIS FORTHCOMING VISIT TO THE U.S. </p><p>OTHERS COMMENTED GLOOMILY ON FUTURE ARAB-AMERICAN </p><p>RELATIONS IN LIGHT OF THE U.S. POSITION ON THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWS REPORTS </p><p>LEAD STORIES IN JORDAN\'S DAILIES ON MAY 2 CONCENTRATED </p><p>ON "THE START OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENDING THE SIEGE </p><p>ON ARAFAT," AND THE TRANSFER OF "ZE\'EVI\'S KILLERS TO </p><p>JERICHO." </p><p> </p><p>DAILIES ALSO REPORTED THE COLLAPSE OF THE FACT-FINDING </p><p>MISSION, UNDER HEADLINES THAT ANNOUNCED: "SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL TO DEBATE THE ISRAEL\'S REJECTION OF THE FACT- </p><p>FINDING MISSION, ARAB DRAFT RESOLUTION CALLING TO EVOKE </p><p>ARTICLE 7." </p><p> </p><p>DAILIES ALSO QUOTED AGENCY REPORTS ABOUT A "U.S.-SAUDI </p><p>STRATEGY TO PRESSURE ISRAEL INTO ENDING THE CURRENT </p><p>CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p> </p><p>-- THE KING\'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON </p><p>PROMINENT DAILY COLUMNIST URAIB AL-RANTAWI WROTE IN </p><p>CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON MAY </p><p>2: "HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH STARTS AN IMPORTANT VISIT </p><p>TO THE U.S. IN WHICH HE ADDRESSES AMERICAN PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION AS WELL AS DECISION MAKING INSTITUTIONS, THINK </p><p>TANKS, AND THE MEDIA. HIS DISCOURSE WILL HIGHLIGHT </p><p>THREE POINTS: FIRST, THAT THE OSLO AGREEMENTS AND </p><p>PHILOSOPHY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR FUNCTIONS, AND THAT </p><p>THERE IS NO USE IN SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WITHOUT A </p><p>POLITICAL DIMENSION, OR TRANSITIONAL AGREEMENTS WITHOUT </p><p>THE FINAL SETTLEMENT.  SECOND, THAT WASHINGTON STANDS </p><p>AS THE ONLY DECISION-MAKING CENTER THAT REMAINS </p><p>CONFUSED BETWEEN THE NEO-CONSERVATIVE TREND THAT PUSHES </p><p>FOR MORE FLAGRANT BIAS IN FAVOR OF THE HEBREW STATE, </p><p>AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT THAT IS BEGINNING TO REALIZE </p><p>THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A POLICY. THIRD, THE NEED TO </p><p>RESTORE THE PNA AND ITS LEADER AFTER THE CAMPAIGNS THAT </p><p>AIMED TO MARGINALIZE AND DESTROY THEM.  THIS DISCOURSE </p><p>AND THE FIELD ACTIVITY THAT WILL FOLLOW WILL BE THE </p><p>QUIET RESPONSE TO THE BOISTEROUS CLAMOR THAT SURROUNDS </p><p>US WITHOUT HAVING ANY VISIBLE CONSEQUENCE." </p><p> </p><p>-- SHOULD WE LOSE HOPE IN AN HONEST AMERICAN MEDIATION? </p><p>FORMER NEWS DIRECTOR IN JORDAN TELEVISION YAQOUB JABER </p><p>WROTE IN CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL- </p><p>DUSTOUR ON MAY 2: "I FEAR THAT THE PALESTINIANS HAVE </p><p>LOST HOPE OF AN HONEST AMERICAN MEDIATION THAT MAY </p><p>PRODUCE A JUST SETTLEMENT OF THEIR STRUGGLE WITH </p><p>ISRAEL. AN HONEST MEDIATION WOULD EXERT PRESSURE ON </p><p>ISRAEL THAT OCCUPIES THE LAND, KILLS AND MUTILATES THE </p><p>PEOPLE, AND REJECTS PEACE.  BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM </p><p>THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS THAT IT NOT CONTENTED WITH </p><p>FLAGRANT SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AND ITS BLOODY CRIMES IN </p><p>PALESTINIAN TOWNS AND VILLAGES, BUT ALSO TOTAL ENMITY </p><p>FOR PALESTINIANS AND THEIR LEGITIMATE LEADERSHIP.  AND </p><p>WE WOULD BE MISTAKEN TO THINK THAT THE PRESENT </p><p>ADMINISTRATION IS MORE BIASED FOR ISRAEL THAT ITS </p><p>PREDECESSORS.  BUT WE SHOULD NOT REACH THE POINT OF </p><p>DESPAIR.  OUR OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE TO REACH AMERICAN </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION THAT MAY HAVE BEGUN TO BE AROUSED BY </p><p>ISRAEL\'S MOST RECENT CRIMES AND STARTED TO FEEL ITS WAY </p><p>IN THE TOTAL OBSCURITY IMPOSED ON IT BY ZIONIST </p><p>PROPAGANDA." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MORE IMPORTANT BATTLE HAS BEGUN </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST KHALIL AL-SAWAHIRI WROTE IN CENTER- </p><p>LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON MAY 2: </p><p>"THE SIGHT OF THE YOUTH IN JENIN CAMP, AFTER SURVIVING </p><p>THE MASSACRE, AS THEY TROD ON CASES OF AID BEARING THE </p><p>U.S. FLAG SENT WAVES OF PRIDE IN OUR SOULS THAT ARE </p><p>SUNK IN SORROW AND FRUSTRATION.  [THE PALESTINIANS] </p><p>HAVE RETURNED TO AMERICA, THE FULL PARTNER IN THE </p><p>CRIME, ITS CRUMBS OF ASSISTANCE THAT ARE SOAKED WITH </p><p>THE BLOOD OF INNOCENT PALESTINIAN CHILDREN.  AND LIKE </p><p>THEM, ARABS REFUSE TO CONTINUE FINANCING THE BARBARIC </p><p>AMERICAN ONSLAUGHT BY BOYCOTTING AMERICAN PRODUCTS.  I </p><p>WAS AMAZED TO HEAR MY SEVEN YEAR-OLD GRANDSON TALK </p><p>ABOUT THIS BOYCOTT, FOR HE KNEW EXACTLY THE NUMBER AND </p><p>TRADEMARKS OF THE PRODUCTS THAT HE AND OTHERS OF HIS </p><p>GENERATION HAVE BOYCOTTED THROUGH THEIR CONVICTION THAT </p><p>EVERY PENNY SPENT ON THEM WILL RETURN AGAINST US AS </p><p>BULLETS AND BOMBS. AMERICA MAY NOT BE CONCERNED WITH </p><p>THIS BOYCOTT, SINCE IT HAS LOTS OF OTHER MARKETS, BUT </p><p>THE CRUCIAL POINT IS THAT ARAB AWARENESS HAS BEEN </p><p>RESTORED.  THE BOYCOTT IS NOT A MERE REFUSAL TO </p><p>CONSUME, BUT A POLITICAL AND MORAL COMMITMENT THAT IS </p><p>GROWING EVERY DAY, AND IT IS THE START OF THE </p><p>CONFRONTATION AND ARAB SELF-DEFENSE AGAINST TOTAL </p><p>SURRENDER TO AMERICA OR ANYONE ELSE.  AMERICA WILL </p><p>DISCOVER WHAT A QUAGMIRE IT HAS DRAGGED ITSELF IN BY </p><p>ITS SHAMEFUL SUPPORT OF THE ISRAELI RACIST AND BARBARIC </p><p>AGGRESSION."  GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
