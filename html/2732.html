(S) SUMMARY.  THE ITALIAN OFFICIAL CHAIRING AN </p><p>INTERMINISTERIAL LICENSING COMMITTEE IS "INCLINED TO SUPPORT" </p><p>THE APPLICATION OF AN ITALIAN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOR A </p><p>LICENSE TO CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA TO REFURBISH </p><p>FACILITIES AT RABTA, LIBYA IN ORDER TO ALLOW THEIR PRODUCTION </p><p>OF MEDICINES.  THE APPLICATION, FIRST SUBMITTED IN FEBRUARY </p><p>2002, WILL NEXT BE CONSIDERED AT THE COMMITTEE\'S 16 APRIL </p><p>MEETING AND MAY BE READY FOR DISPOSITION IN MAY.  PER REF A, </p><p>POST CONVEYED THE USG\'S EXTREME CONCERN THAT LIBYA REMAINS </p><p>DETERMINED TO DEVELOP CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS USING </p><p>JUST THIS KIND OF CIVILIAN COVER.  MFA OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, </p><p>SEE THE CONTRACT -- PROBABLY SUPPORTED BY A PARALLEL </p><p>GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT EXCHANGE OF LETTERS AND LIBYAN </p><p>ACCESSION TO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION -- AS A MEANS OF </p><p>ENSURING THAT LIBYA USES RABTA ONLY FOR LICIT PURPOSES. </p><p>GIVEN MFA\'S INCLINATION TO APPROVE THE APPLICATION, POST </p><p>ADVISES THAT A SERIOUS EFFORT TO DERAIL THE LICENSE WOULD </p><p>DEMAND VERY HIGH-LEVEL WASHINGTON ATTENTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) AS FORESEEN IN DECEMBER WHEN THE GOI FIRST ASKED FOR </p><p>THE USG\'S POSITION, AN ITALIAN COMPANY, PHARMACHIM OF MILAN, </p><p>HAS APPLIED FOR A GOI LICENSE TO CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF LIBYA TO REFURBISH CHEMICAL PRODUCTION FACILITIES AT </p><p>RABTA, ACCORDING TO MFA\'S MIDDLE EAST DEPUTY DIRCTOR GENERAL </p><p>FRANCESCO CERULLI AND NONPROLIFERATION ISSUES COORDINATOR UGO </p><p>DEMOHR.  DISPLAYING GENERAL FAMILIARITY WITH THE CASE, </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01748  01 OF 02  081729Z </p><p>CERULLI RESPONDED TO ECONOFF\'S MARCH 29 PRESENTATION OF REF A </p><p>DEMARCHE BY URGING WASHINGTON TO APPRECIATE THAT THE COMPANY </p><p>IS NOT APPLYING MERELY TO EXPORT CHEMICALS TO LIBYA (HE </p><p>DOUBTED THE GOI WOULD APPROVE SIMPLE EXPORTS) BUT WOULD </p><p>REMAIN IN LIBYA FOR TEN YEARS TO MANAGE THE PLANT, PRESENTING </p><p>AN ONGOING OPPORTUNITY FOR ITALY TO SHAPE AND MONITOR EVENTS. </p><p> HE DEFERRED TO DE MOHR, WHO CHAIRS THE INTERMINISTERIAL </p><p>COMMITTEE CHARGED WITH RULING ON THE APPLICATION, FOR </p><p>SPECIFICS OF THE STATUS OF THE CASE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) IN AN APRIL 4 MEETING WITH ECONOFF, DE MOHR IDENTIFIED </p><p>THE COMPANY AS PHARMACHIM OF MILAN AND SAID ITS FEBRUARY 2002 </p><p>APPLICATION TO CONTRACT WITH THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT WOULD BE </p><p>CONSIDERED AT HIS COMMITTEE\'S 16 APRIL MEETING.  HE SAID </p><p>ITALY IS ABOUT TO CRIMINALIZE UNLICENSED DUAL USE TECHNOLOGY </p><p>TRANSFERS, EFFECTIVELY STRENGTHENING HIS COMMITTEE. </p><p>PHARMACHIM CANNOT EXPORT CHEMICALS TO LIBYA UNDER EXISTING </p><p>LAW AND SOON, HE EXPLAINED, WOULD BE UNABLE TO EXPORT </p><p>KNOW-HOW EITHER.  THE COMPANY IS EXPECTED TO SUBMIT CERTAIN </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION BY THE 16 APRIL MEETING AND DE MOHR </p><p>SPECULATED THE APPLICATION COULD BE RIPE FOR A COMMITTEE </p><p>RULING BY ITS MAY MEETING.  HE SAID THAT NONE OF THE </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- WHICH INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE </p><p>MINISTRIES OF DEFENSE, PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES, ECONOMY AND </p><p>FINANCE, THE DEPUTY MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE, AND THE </p><p>ITALIAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY -- HAS TO DATE INDICATED </p><p>PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT THE APPLICATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) DE MOHR AND CERULLI EXPLAINED HOW THE APPLICATION CAME </p><p>ABOUT AND OUTLINED SOME FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN ITS </p><p>DISPOSITION.  DE MOHR SAID THERE WAS NO FORMAL TENDER; </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01748  01 OF 02  081729Z </p><p>RATHER, LIBYAN OFFICIALS APPROACHED PHARMACHIM AND THE </p><p>BRITISH COMPANY GLAXOSMITH TO GAUGE INTEREST.  HE SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT THE COMMITTEE, IF OTHERWISE DISPOSED TO GRANT THE </p><p>APPLICATION, WOULD LIKELY INSIST THAT PHARMACHIM\'S LICENSE BE </p><p>CONTINGENT UPON A GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT EXCHANGE OF </p><p>LETTERS GUARANTEEING TO THE GOI THE RIGHT TO SEND INSPECTORS </p><p>FROM THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND ELSEWHERE TO RABTA THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) CERULLI SAID THE GOI IS PUSHING HARD IN TRIPOLI FOR </p><p>LIBYA TO ACCEDE TO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION AND </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT LIBYAN ACCESSION SHOULD ALLAY USG FEARS ABOUT </p><p>RABTA.  DE MOHR INSISTED THAT LIBYA HAD AGREED TO SIGN THE </p><p>CWC, ALTHOUGH HE PREDICTED THAT THE RATIFICATION PROCESS </p><p>WOULD BE SLOW.  HE SAID THAT LIBYAN ACCESSION TO THE CWC </p><p>WOULD BE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BUT ADDED THAT THE COMMITTEE </p><p>WOULD VALUE MUCH MORE THE KIND OF BILATERAL INSPECTION </p><p>GUARANTEES LIBYA ACCEPTS.  "AFTERALL," HE SAID, "CWC MEMBERS </p><p>HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO CHEAT." </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) ECONOFF READ OR PARAPHRASED REFTEL TALKING POINTS TO </p><p>BOTH CERULLI AND DE MOHR IN THEIR ENTIRETY, EMPHASIZING USG </p><p>SKEPTICISM ABOUT ANY FORWARD MOVEMENT, NO MATTER HOW </p><p>CHARACTERIZED, ON CHEMICAL FACILITIES IN LIBYA AND ESPECIALLY </p><p>AT RABTA.  TO DE MOHR, A PRIMARY GOI REPRESENTATIVE TO THE </p><p>AUSTRALIA GROUP, ECONOFF FLAGGED IN PARTICULAR THE TALKING </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET        PTQ8681 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01748  02 OF 02  081729Z </p><p>ACTION NP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CIP-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NEA-00   NRRC-00  NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PM-00    ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   T-00     USIE-00  BBG-00   SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------80CA93  081729Z /38 </p><p>O 081638Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 3158 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY LONDON IMMEDIATE </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>S E C R E T SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001748 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NP/CBM FOR ROE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC </p><p>PASS DOC FOR BXA/CBC/SEEVARATNAM AND BROWN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: XI, X5 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ETTC, IT, PARM, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY MAY LET PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY ENTER LIBYA </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01748  02 OF 02  081729Z </p><p> </p><p>POINT SUMMARIZING AG EVIDENCE THAT LIBYA HAS ALREADY </p><p>RESTARTED ITS CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM.  AGREEING FULLY THAT </p><p>RABTA WAS IN THE PAST A CW FACILITY, DE MOHR ARGUED IN REPLY </p><p>THAT A GOI LICENSE TO PHARMACHIM COMBINED WITH A </p><p>GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT AGREEMENT COULD LESSEN THE </p><p>LIKELIHOOD OF LIBYA REALIZING ANY LINGERING CW AMBITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) DE MOHR UNDERSTANDS THE LIBYANS HAVE GIVEN THE NOD TO </p><p>PHARMACHIM OVER GLAXOSMITH BUT ALSO HEARS THAT GLAXOSMITH, </p><p>ALREADY A DOMINANT PLAYER IN THE AFRICAN MARKET, HAS NOT </p><p>GIVEN UP.  HIS COMMITTEE, THEREFORE, IS NOT INCLINED TO </p><p>LINGER OVER THE APPLICATION. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) COMMENT.  THE ITALIANS ARE VERY WILLING TO DISCUSS </p><p>THIS MATTER WITH US.  CERULLI WAS PIQUED THAT THE FORMAL USG </p><p>MESSAGE DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT TO HIM ARE OBVIOUS </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ADVANTAGES IN ALLOWING PHARMACHIM TO PROCEED. </p><p>HIS RESPONSE, COMBINED WITH DE MOHR\'S PRELIMINARY INCLINATION </p><p>TO SUPPORT THE APPLICATION, PERSUADE US THAT THE GOI WILL </p><p>VERY LIKELY APPROVE THIS APPLICATION.  TO HAVE ANY PROSPECT </p><p>OF SUCCESS, A USG EFFORT TO DERAIL THE LICENSE WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>ORIGINATE AT A VERY HIGH USG LEVEL AND, ENGAGING THE GOI AT A </p><p>SIMILAR LEVEL, AND SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE GOI VIEW THAT </p><p>ITALIAN PARTICIPATION WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT USE OF </p><p>RABTA FOR ILLICIT B/CW PRODUCTION. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01748 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
