<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 002454 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/NGA, NEA/ARP </p><p>USDOC FOR 1000/IRAQ TASK FORCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: BORDER FREE-FOR-ALL; GOK COMPLAINS ABOUT LACK OF </p><p>COALITION BORDER CONTROL IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para. 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During their June 4 meeting, Kuwaiti MinState for </p><p>Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah informed the </p><p>Ambassador that the Kuwaiti business community is becoming </p><p>increasingly frustrated that coalition forces in Iraq are not </p><p>controlling Iraq\'s borders.  Dr. Mohammed said the lack of </p><p>control on the Iraqi side is forcing the GOK to keep its </p><p>border crossings closed to most commercial activity, severely </p><p>hampering the ability of Kuwaiti companies to conduct </p><p>cross-border commerce.  This did not appear to be the case </p><p>with Jordan and Turkey\'s borders, he said.  Dr. Mohammed </p><p>asked the Ambassador to share any plans the coalition may </p><p>have to control Iraq\'s borders with him as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment: Embassy has also received reports that GCC </p><p>businessmen, including Kuwaitis, cannot get their goods into </p><p>Iraq through Kuwait, but Iraqi borders with Turkey and Jordan </p><p>are open and bustling.  While Kuwait continues to maintain </p><p>close control of its borders, the fact that Kuwaiti </p><p>businessmen have resorted to shipping goods to Iraq via </p><p>points as distant as Aqaba is putting the GOK in a very </p><p>difficult spot.  Dr. Mohammed\'s comments to the Ambassador </p><p>are an obvious indicator that pressure on the GOK from </p><p>Kuwait\'s business community is steadily mounting.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>4. Action Request:  Post requests Department guidance on how </p><p>to best respond to Dr. Mohammed\'s inquiry about plans for </p><p>further control of Iraqi borders. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
