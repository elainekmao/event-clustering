<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003017 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, KISL, PTER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: GOMBE STATE GOVERNOR\'S VIEWS ON </p><p>NIGERIAN POLITICS AND THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ABUJA 03014 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASON </p><p>1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: On October 6, Ambassador Jeter and </p><p>Economic Officer Hricik met with Gombe State Governor </p><p>Hashidu and Deputy Governor Lidani to discuss Nigerian </p><p>politics and Northern views on the U.S.  The Governor </p><p>said the National Assembly\'s attempt to impeach </p><p>President Obasanjo sent the wrong message to the </p><p>international community, but blamed Obasanjo for </p><p>failing to work well with legislators.  The </p><p>impeachment process was intended to weaken Obasanjo to </p><p>where he fails to win the PDP nomination, said the </p><p>Governor.  Hashidu thought former Head of State </p><p>Babaginda would not run for the Presidency if Obasanjo </p><p>were a candidate, but believed Vice President Atiku </p><p>would run.  More ominously, the Governor added that </p><p>political instability could possibly open a door for </p><p>military intervention.  Hashidu said that Northern </p><p>Nigerians largely misunderstand the US-led global war </p><p>on terrorism, and that poverty is the main cause for </p><p>the attraction of some Nigerians to radical Islam. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>THE DOWNSIDE OF THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During an October 6 visit to Gombe State, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by Econoff met with </p><p>Gombe State Governor Abubakar Habu Hashidu and Deputy </p><p>Governor Joshua Lidani to discuss Nigerian politics </p><p>and views on the U.S.  Responding to the Ambassador\'s </p><p>question on the ongoing impeachment drive, Hashidu </p><p>said that the National Assembly had the right to </p><p>impeach the President; however the impeachment process </p><p>now underway is counterproductive.  It is splintering </p><p>the country and sending the wrong message to the </p><p>international community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>WEAKENING OBASANJO </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Hashidu stated that most Senators, who </p><p>supported impeachment, were angry because Obasanjo did </p><p>not release approximately USD 3.8 million for each </p><p>Senatorial district\'s constituency projects.  He added </p><p>that Obasanjo had infuriated many National Assembly </p><p>members, by calling them "jokers."  Hashidu said that </p><p>Northern governors, in the coming months, will attempt </p><p>to act as a bridge between the President and the </p><p>National Assembly.  The Governor then remarked that </p><p>the impeachment threat eventually will be dropped (he </p><p>was right), but only after the President is further </p><p>weakened to the extent that he is denied the PDP </p><p>renomination.  When the Ambassador stated that the </p><p>National Assembly has not passed important bills such </p><p>as telecommunications and AGOA, the Governor responded </p><p>that the National Assembly was more interested in </p><p>"making money" than in governance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>BABAGINDA </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Responding to the Ambassador\'s question, </p><p>Hashidu said that he did not know if Babangida was </p><p>supporting the impeachment drive (Hashidu served as </p><p>Minister of Agriculture and Water during Babangida\'s </p><p>rule (1988-1993)).  He also stated that he was </p><p>uncertain if IBB would run for President in 2003. </p><p>Hashidu agreed with an assessment that IBB would not </p><p>run, if Obasanjo remained a candidate.  Asked by the </p><p>Ambassador whether Vice President Atiku will stand for </p><p>the Presidency, the Governor said it was likely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>NIGERIA\'S LEARNING CURVE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador told the Governor that the USG </p><p>is not interested in political personalities but </p><p>wanted to see a fair process.  He added that Nigerians </p><p>must decide who they want in public office.  Asserting </p><p>that growing political unrest was a sign of possible </p><p>instability, Hashidu also added that this is a </p><p>learning time for the country. Nigeria will continue </p><p>to refine its democracy and maybe after 12 years the </p><p>process will improve, he said.  The Ambassador then </p><p>remarked that in 1999, many highly qualified, able </p><p>Nigerians chose not to run for public office, fearing </p><p>that the fledgling democracy would not last.  The </p><p>Ambassador asked whether the new crop of candidates in </p><p>2003 would be better?  The Governor said that in a </p><p>national campaign you need money; the more you have </p><p>the better you can contest.  National Assembly members </p><p>are making money and are better equipped to run for </p><p>office than more qualified, but less affluent </p><p>prospective candidates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>PITFALLS FOR NIGERIA </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Hashidu said many Obasanjo supporters now feel </p><p>victimized by the impeachment process, and the </p><p>resulting political uncertainty was being watched </p><p>closely by some in the military. The Ambassador </p><p>interjected that in the past this could have been a </p><p>likely time for the military to step-in; however, our </p><p>reading was this was not now the case.  The Ambassador </p><p>added that the USG had spent a lot of effort and </p><p>resources working with senior and middle-level </p><p>officers, but agreed with the Governor that lower </p><p>ranking officers\' motivations are difficult to know. </p><p>Hashidu expressed fears that a military intervention </p><p>could bring to power relatively young officers, "If we </p><p>are not lucky, they will wipe us (ruling elite) all </p><p>out.We cannot dig our own graves."  Hashidu said that </p><p>Nigeria was fortunate that many of those who could </p><p>have staged a coup have been hopefully flushed out of </p><p>the military by the Obasanjo Government.  However, </p><p>Hashidu remarked that U.S. support for Pakistan\'s </p><p>President Musharraf, still gave some in the military </p><p>hope. "If America will support Musharraf, maybe </p><p>they\'ll do it for us (military ruler)," he added.  The </p><p>Ambassador remarked that the political realities in </p><p>Pakistan and Nigeria were not the same. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>NORTHERN VIEW ON THE U.S. </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The Ambassador asked Hashidu how Northern and </p><p>Northeastern Nigerian Muslims perceive the United </p><p>States in the post-9/11 era?  The Governor said that </p><p>radical Islamic groups in Nigeria view the U.S. as </p><p>fighting a war against Islam; the average Northern </p><p>Muslim is often misinformed and views the U.S. as over </p><p>reacting, even if in self-defense. Though the vast </p><p>majority of North and Northeast Muslims are Sunni, </p><p>there are very small radical factions of Shiite and </p><p>extremist Sunni Muslims, who are anti-American, he </p><p>added.  Hashidu then redirected the conversation, </p><p>saying he thought Saudi Arabia should keep quiet about </p><p>the US-led fight against terrorism and possible </p><p>conflict with Iraq.  Hashidu said, the ruling-elite in </p><p>Saudi Arabia maintain power through U.S. and UK </p><p>support.  The Ambassador then asked whether there were </p><p>Saudis, Iraqis or Iranians working through non- </p><p>governmental organizations in Nigeria?  The Governor </p><p>said he was not aware of any, but he could not vouch </p><p>for what is happening in Kano or other Northern </p><p>states. Hashidu added that, due to poverty, millions </p><p>of Nigerians are in Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan, </p><p>often working in deplorable conditions.  The Governor </p><p>ended by saying poverty was the key ingredient for </p><p>radical Islam\'s expansion in Nigeria and beyond. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Governor was very relaxed, open and </p><p>engaging during the 75-minute meeting. Hashidu, who </p><p>maintained high-ranking Ministerial positions under </p><p>both military and civilian rule, now portrays himself </p><p>as a populist democrat.  A political strategist, </p><p>Hashidu is among Northern Nigeria\'s most politically </p><p>influential governors. Hashidu was delighted with the </p><p>Ambassador\'s visit to Gombe and pulled out all the </p><p>stops, including a State Dinner, a tour of State </p><p>development projects (reftel), and a meeting with the </p><p>State Executive Council.  The Governor has made a </p><p>point of calling a meeting with the Ambassador during </p><p>Hashidu\'s subsequent visits to Abuja.  This kind of </p><p>personal engagement is absolutely essential to winning </p><p>the hears and minds in Nigeria\'s Islamic North.  END </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
