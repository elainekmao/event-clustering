<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 001555 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/08/02 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: EX-STRONGMAN NE WIN DIES WHILE UNDER DETENTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM: RON MCMULLEN FOR REASON 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  Ne Win is dead.  The news has not yet hit </p><p>the streets in Rangoon, but Ne Win\'s son told the DCM that </p><p>reports of his father\'s death were true.  Ne Win\'s death is </p><p>likely to have little political impact.  However, many in </p><p>Burma will have trouble believing that "the old man" is </p><p>finally gone.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ne Win\'s son Ngwe Soe told DCM this afternoon that </p><p>press reports that his father had died were true.  Following </p><p>up on press reports that Ne Win died at 7:30 this morning, </p><p>December 5, DCM attempted to visit the residence where Ne Win </p><p>and his daughter Sanda Win have reportedly been under house </p><p>arrest since March.  Authorities at the scene refused to </p><p>comment on the reports but DCM encountered Ngwe Soe waiting </p><p>by the police roadblock to the compound and apparently not </p><p>allowed to enter.  Ngwe Soe acknowledged that his father was </p><p>dead but asked that the DCM not convey this to reporters who </p><p>were waiting nearby.  While we have no specific information </p><p>on the cause of death, "the old man," as he is known here in </p><p>Rangoon, has suffered from heart disease for years.  In 2001, </p><p>he reportedly received a pace-maker at a hospital in </p><p>Singapore and he may have made at least one follow-up visit </p><p>since that operation. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  Ne Win, who ruled Burma with an iron fist from the </p><p>late 1950\'s until the late 1980\'s, has lived in virtual </p><p>seclusion for most of the last 15 years.  Although he is </p><p>blamed for single-handedly destroying what had been a vibrant </p><p>Burmese economy with his personal brand of pseudo-socialist </p><p>policies, and for brutally crushing any political dissent, he </p><p>was also grudgingly admired for his charismatic personality. </p><p>He swept people into his cause and then, just as quickly, </p><p>imprisoned, tortured, and killed those he perceived to be a </p><p>possible threat.  In the late 1980\'s when dire conditions </p><p>from his economic policies created riots and protests, he </p><p>retired from power and was succeeded by the State Law and </p><p>Order Council (SLORC).  In 1997, the SLORC renamed itself the </p><p>State Peace and Development Committee (SPDC) and remains in </p><p>power today. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Ne Win was 91 years old and is survived by two </p><p>wives, two daughters, two sons and two-step daughters from </p><p>his four marriages.  One daughter, Sanda Win, jealously </p><p>guarded access to the father over the years and attempted to </p><p>promote his legacy through her own three sons.  Other family </p><p>members, including ex-wives and other children, were </p><p>reportedly allowed only infrequent "audiences" with Ne Win. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Sanda\'s efforts to promote her sons as successors to </p><p>the Ne Win throne came to an abrupt and unexpected halt </p><p>earlier this year when the sons and their father were </p><p>arrested on charges of high treason and economic </p><p>improprieties.  While the sons were roundly despised in </p><p>Rangoon for their violent excesses and flagrant disregard for </p><p>the law, few here believe that they had the brains or </p><p>inclination to plot a coup attempt.  Their arrests and </p><p>subsequent sentences, and Sanda and Ne Win\'s house arrest, </p><p>are generally believed to be an effort by SPDC Senior General </p><p>Than Shwe, once a Ne Win underling, to wipe away any </p><p>speculation that he was still under Ne Win\'s influence. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  We expect most ordinary Burmese will react to Ne </p><p>Win\'s passing with glee but, unfortunately, it is unlikely </p><p>that his death will have any effect on the current regime\'s </p><p>political or economic policies.  Senior General Than Shwe has </p><p>made a pointed effort in recent years to distance the SPDC </p><p>from Ne Win\'s legacy and put an end to rumors that Ne Win </p><p>still wielded any power.  Furthermore, Than Shwe, like Ne Win </p><p>before him, has asserted his personal control through purges </p><p>of powerful ministers and military members.  Of the original </p><p>19 SLORC members only three - Than Shwe, Maung Aye, and Khin </p><p>Nyunt - remain, and Than Shwe\'s authority is clearly </p><p>unchallenged. </p><p> </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
