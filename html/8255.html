<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001480 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR DRL/CRA, DRL/IRF, DRL/PHD, WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA - 2003 RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. OTTAWA 02 1429 </p><p> </p><p>1. Sensitive but Unclassified - please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2. The following constitutes Ottawa\'s submission for the 2003 </p><p>International Religious Freedom Report. </p><p> </p><p>Introduction and Overview </p><p> </p><p>No changes. </p><p> </p><p>Section I:  Religious Demography </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph that begins "There is no state or dominant </p><p>religion..."  - revise as follows: </p><p> </p><p>While there is no state or dominant religion, an estimated </p><p>74.6 percent of the Canadian population belongs to Christian </p><p>dominations or claims Christianity as their religion. Roman </p><p>Catholics (43 percent of the population) constitute the </p><p>largest single religious denomination, followed by Protestant </p><p>denominations (29 percent). United Church, Anglican, </p><p>Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, and Pentecostal are the </p><p>largest Protestant denominations in Canada. 1.1 percent of </p><p>the Canadian population is Jewish.  According to a recent </p><p>government census, the percentage of the population who are </p><p>members of the Muslim faith has increased to 2 percent of the </p><p>population; the number of Muslims in Canada has doubled in </p><p>the 10-year period since the last census. Other religious </p><p>groups in Canada include Buddhists (approximately 1 percent </p><p>of the population); Hindus (1 percent); and Sikhs (1 </p><p>percent). The number of persons professing other religions, </p><p>such as Scientology, Baha\'i, Shinto, Taoism, aboriginal </p><p>spirituality, and pagan religions, constitutes 0.2 percent of </p><p>the population. The census also reflected that the percentage </p><p>of Canadians claiming no religious affiliation is 16 percent </p><p>of the total population, an increase from 12 percent in the </p><p>last census. </p><p> </p><p>A 2002 poll on religious attitudes by the Pew Research Center </p><p>indicated that approximately 21 percent of Canadians attend </p><p>church on a weekly basis. 30 percent of Canadians, according </p><p>to the survey, said that religion is very important to them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section II: Status of Religious Freedom </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 3 that begins, "The Constitution and...," revise as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>The Constitution of Canada and the Charter of Rights and </p><p>Freedoms protect the rights or privileges possessed by </p><p>denominational schools at the time of national union in 1867. </p><p> In practice this protection has meant that some provinces </p><p>have funded and continue to fund Catholic school education, </p><p>and some provinces (such as Quebec) have funded some </p><p>Protestant education.  In recent years, the Quebec provincial </p><p>government took steps to abolish Catholic and Protestant </p><p>status for public schools; public schools in Quebec are no </p><p>longer faith-based and are open to all. And the Ontario </p><p>provincial government, which previously had allowed tax </p><p>credits only for tuition paid to Roman Catholic private </p><p>schools, began allowing tax credits for tuition paid to all </p><p>private schools, provided such schools satisfy certain </p><p>educational standards. </p><p> </p><p>There is no official government council for interfaith </p><p>dialogue, but the government of Canada provides funding for </p><p>individual ecumenical projects on a case-by-case basis. </p><p> </p><p>Restrictions on Religious Freedom </p><p> </p><p>Government policy and practice contributed to the generally </p><p>free practice of religion. </p><p> </p><p>Remainder of paragraph beginning "(H)owever, in May 2001...", </p><p>and paragraph beginning "(I)n July 2001..." - delete. </p><p>Replace with the following: </p><p> </p><p>The Supreme Court of Canada recently agreed to hear cases </p><p>brought by groups in Quebec that claim their religious rights </p><p>have been unduly restricted by condominium contracts, and </p><p>municipal bylaws. One case involves a group of Orthodox </p><p>Jewish families, living in a Montreal condominium complex, </p><p>who were barred by the condominium association from </p><p>constructing temporary huts on their balconies to celebrate </p><p>the fall festival of Sukkot. The second case involves a group </p><p>of Jehovah\'s Witnesses who are seeking the rezoning of a </p><p>tract of land they own, so that a church hall can be built on </p><p>the land. The municipality where the land is located refused </p><p>to rezone the land, because the land would no longer be </p><p>subject to property taxes if a place of worship was built on </p><p>it. Decisions in these cases are expected sometime this year. </p><p> </p><p>A standing committee on justice and human rights organized by </p><p>the Parliament of Canada is currently conducting a series of </p><p>public hearings on the issue of whether homosexual couples </p><p>have the right to marry.  The hearings were organized after </p><p>an Ontario court ruled that the legal definition of marriage </p><p>as a union of one man and one woman violated the equality </p><p>rights of homosexuals. Some of the hearings have resulted in </p><p>spirited debates between gay rights advocates and </p><p>representatives of religious faiths, who assert that marriage </p><p>is a religious and not a political matter, and that religious </p><p>denominations should not be forced into ordaining same-sex </p><p>marriages. The committee is expected to bring its </p><p>recommendations on the issue to Parliament later this year. </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees. </p><p> </p><p>Forced Religious Conversion </p><p> </p><p>No changes to this paragraph. </p><p> </p><p>Improved and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious </p><p>Freedom. </p><p> </p><p>Delete sentence beginning "In September 2001..." </p><p> </p><p>Section III.  Societal Attitudes </p><p> </p><p>The generally amicable relationship among the religions in </p><p>society contributes to religious freedom in Canada.  (After </p><p>this sentence, delete remainder of first paragraph, and the </p><p>second, third and fourth paragraphs of this section.  Replace </p><p>with the following:) </p><p> </p><p>However, tension continues to exist between the Jewish and </p><p>Islamic communities in Canada, perhaps reflecting the </p><p>continued conflict in the Middle East. The number of </p><p>anti-Semitic incidents in Canada increased again during this </p><p>period, and there have been expressions of anti-Muslim </p><p>feeling as well. </p><p> </p><p>The B\'nai Brith Canada League for Human Rights received 459 </p><p>reports of anti-Semitic incidents in 2002, an increase of 173 </p><p>incidents from 2001. Incidents included general harassment of </p><p>Jews (282 or 61 percent of the reported incidents), vandalism </p><p>of property (148 or 32 percent), and violence (29 or 6 </p><p>percent). In an incident in Montreal on September 9, 2002, </p><p>pro-Palestinian demonstrators assaulted a number of Jews </p><p>during a riot on the Concordia University campus, where </p><p>former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was </p><p>scheduled to give a speech.  In Toronto, there was </p><p>controversy following the July 2002 murder of an orthodox </p><p>Jew. The accused murderer is a young skinhead, and many </p><p>members of the Jewish community believed the victim had been </p><p>killed because of his religion, thus making the murder a hate </p><p>crime. </p><p> </p><p>Expressions of anti-Muslim sentiment continued in Canada </p><p>during this period, according to the Canadian chapter of the </p><p>Council on American Islamic Relations. In a survey released </p><p>in September 2002, 60 percent of Canadian Muslims said they </p><p>had experienced bias or discrimination in the period </p><p>following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  The build-up to the </p><p>war in Iraq stirred up some anti-Muslim feeling in Canada, </p><p>but also resulted in some expressions of compassion and </p><p>support towards Muslims. The main forms of prejudice </p><p>experienced by Muslims were verbal abuse, religious or ethnic </p><p>profiling, and discrimination in the workplace. Some Muslims </p><p>believe the government of Canada has been indifferent to </p><p>anti-Muslim attitudes and discrimination. </p><p> </p><p>In November 2002, an information center in Quebec run by the </p><p>Raelian religion was vandalized. Damage to the center, known </p><p>as "UFO Land," amounted to more than C$100,000. The Raelian </p><p>Church of Canada is an officially recognized religion in </p><p>Quebec. The religion, which is based on the idea that </p><p>extraterrestrials created humanity as part of a lab </p><p>experiment, had targeted Quebec high schools as part of its </p><p>ongoing campaign to persuade Roman Catholics to renounce </p><p>their faith. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Section IV.  U.S. Government Policy. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government discusses religious freedom issues with </p><p>the Government of Canada in the context of its overall </p><p>dialogue and policy of promoting human rights. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
