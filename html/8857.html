<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001252 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC MAKES PLANS WHILE WAITING FOR ITS LEADER TO BE </p><p>RELEASED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Peggy Blackford for reasons 1.5b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Although the MDC is clearly missing its leader who </p><p>continues to be imprisoned on new treason charges, it remains </p><p>united and strong according to Special Presidential Advisor </p><p>Gandi Mudzingwa.  Criticisms leveled against the MDC </p><p>leadership are just that, criticisms, not indications of any </p><p>split in the party.  There has been no progress in </p><p>negotiations via any of the actors who have hoped to bring </p><p>the parties to the table.  The South Africans may be talking </p><p>to Mugabe but, in Mudzingwa\'s opinion, are ignoring the MDC. </p><p>The MDC, in the meanwhile, is gearing up for district </p><p>elections in August and is badly in need of funds.  It </p><p>appears that other new initiatives will wait for the release </p><p>of Tsvangirai however. </p><p> </p><p>Status of MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai - Morale at the MDC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) At a lunch with Gandi Mudzingwa, Special Advisor to </p><p>Tsvangirai, PolOff asked how the MDC leader was faring. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Mudzingwa said that he seemed to be holding up well although </p><p>no one but his wife and his attorneys have been able to see </p><p>him in the remand prison.   Mudzingwa repeated the story we </p><p>have been told by Tsvangirai\'s attorney that the judgment on </p><p>bail for the new treason charges is ready and said that he </p><p>believed that it would be handed down this afternoon.  Later </p><p>inquiries to the attorney, however, suggested that that may </p><p>have been wishful thinking on Mudzingwa\'s part. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Asked about criticism of the MDC by civil society, </p><p>which questioned the appropriateness of demonstrations, and </p><p>discontent among the youth wing of the party, which has </p><p>threatened to demonstrate against Tsvangirai\'s continued </p><p>imprisonment, Mudzingwa said these were the complaints of a </p><p>few individuals and flatly denied any serious threats of </p><p>splits within the party.  He said that he personally had been </p><p>a bit downcast by the failure of the demonstrations but upon </p><p>reflection had concluded that the stayaway had been much </p><p>better than the one in March.  Therefore, on the whole, he </p><p>was content with the outcome of the mass action. </p><p> </p><p>No progress towards negotiations </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PolOff queried whether there had been any contacts </p><p>from any of the various parties that have been trying to </p><p>bring about negotiations.  Mudzingwa confirmed the church </p><p>leaders had been in touch with the party leadership on June 9 </p><p>as reported septel but denied that there had been any contact </p><p>at all from the South Africans, although he conceded that the </p><p>SAG might well have been speaking to the GOZ.  He criticized </p><p>the SAG approach, saying that they want to limit their </p><p>contacts to Mugabe and ZANU-PF and seem to think that the MDC </p><p>will simply agree to whatever ZANU wants as long as there is </p><p>some sort of transition. </p><p> </p><p>In the meantime, MDC makes plans </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.(C)  Mudzingwa  said that the party was currently hard at </p><p>work trying to find candidates for all the contested district </p><p>elections scheduled for August.  In some ZANU-PF strongholds </p><p>it was proving tough to find a candidate willing to risk </p><p>pressure and threats of violence.  Finances were getting more </p><p>difficult and the party was considering sending a spokesman </p><p>to the US with the hope of raising funds.  He hinted that he </p><p>would like USG support in such a venture.  PolOff told him </p><p>that was impossible but said she was sure many human rights </p><p>and other US based organizations would be willing to help. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Although the MDC remains cohesive, without </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s leadership, it seems to lack a certain spark and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to be marking time rather than moving forward.  All the more </p><p>reason why it is crucial that Tsvangirai receive his \'get out </p><p>of jail" card ASAP. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
