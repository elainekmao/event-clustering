<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001861 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/26/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AS, ZI, CA, UK, SF, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CANADIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER ON ZIMBABWE </p><p>AND THE COMMONWEALTH AND POST-G-8 SUMMIT PLANS BY NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Canadian High Commissioner Ian Ferguson called the </p><p>Ambassador on July 26 to fill him in on information he had </p><p>picked up during the High Commissioner\'s farewell calls, </p><p>including on President Obasanjo.  Ferguson said he thought </p><p>the U.S. would be particularly interested in what he had </p><p>learned regarding Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth and on </p><p>Nigeria\'s post-G-8 Summit intentions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ferguson said that Nigeria was trying to revive the </p><p>idea of establishing a small group meeting of Commonwealth </p><p>countries to try to find a solution to the problems in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Nigeria\'s hope was that the group could meet in </p><p>August.  The meeting would be ad hoc, and would include the </p><p>UK, Australia, Canada, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Nigeria as </p><p>the Chair.  According to Ferguson, the UK has not yet agreed </p><p>to the meeting, and has asked Nigeria for clarification on </p><p>the terms of reference.  The meeting was being planned in </p><p>preparation for the Commonwealth Summit in Australia October </p><p>6-10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ferguson also said that he and Obasanjo had discussed </p><p>the G-8 Summit in Genoa.  Obasanjo gave the impression of </p><p>being very engaged on post-G-8 Summit planning.  To that end, </p><p>Obasanjo plans to Chair an Africa Group meeting of senior </p><p>African leaders that will include Millennium Action Plan </p><p>(MAP) partners South Africa and Algeria, and fifteen other </p><p>African countries to meet in Dakar to discuss the Genoa </p><p>Summit and Africa\'s future engagement with the G-8.  Ferguson </p><p>said that it was his impression that Obasanjo\'s taking the </p><p>lead on this initiative had been worked out with Mbeki so as </p><p>to avoid any competition between Nigeria and South Africa. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
