(U) PRESIDENT MUGABE TOLD VISITING SADC MINISTERS </p><p>AND A NIGERIAN NGO IN HARARE THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION WILL TAKE PLACE IN MARCH 2002, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PRINT AND BROADCAST MEDIA.  MUGABE </p><p>DID NOT PROVIDE SPECIFIC DATES, AS THESE WILL BE SET </p><p>LATER BY THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL.  MUGABE ALSO REPORTEDLY </p><p>STATED THAT REPRESENTATIVES FROM SADC, THE AFRICAN </p><p>UNION, COMMONWEALTH, ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN </p><p>STATES (ECOWAS), AND INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE EU (BUT </p><p>NOT THE EU AS A BLOC), WOULD BE INVITED TO OBSERVE THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  MUGABE\'S STATEMENT DID NOT </p><p>INCLUDE AN INVITATION FOR AMERICAN AND BRITISH </p><p>OBSERVERS.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, MUGABE BRIEFED </p><p>THE SADC MINISTERS ON THE "UNITED STATES SANCTIONS BILL" </p><p>AND OTHER "ILLEGAL" ACTIONS BY BRITAIN AND THE EU </p><p>AGAINST ZIMBABWE.  "I WILL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN </p><p>INVITING SOME WHITE MEN HERE.  I WOULD RATHER INVITE THE </p><p>ASIANS OR CARIBBEANS ... OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME GOOD </p><p>COUNTRIES WITHIN THE [EU] AND THOSE WE SHALL INVITE TO </p><p>SEND OBSERVERS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT," MUGABE IS QUOTED AS </p><p>SAYING. </p><p> </p><p>NEXT STEPS IN ELECTORAL PROCESS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MUGABE\'S PRONOUNCEMENT OF A MARCH ELECTION JUST </p><p>DAYS BEFORE THE ANNUAL ZANU-PF CONFERENCE IS DUE TO </p><p>BEGIN SIGNALS HIS INTENTION TO USE THE ANNUAL GATHERING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03688  121537Z </p><p>AS THE JUMPING OFF POINT OF HIS OFFICIAL CANDIDACY. </p><p>SPECIFIC DATES FOR THE ELECTION ARE LIKELY TO BE </p><p>ANNOUNCED SOON AFTER THE CONFERENCE, BUT MUST BE </p><p>GAZETTED BY THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL BETWEEN JANUARY 2 AND </p><p>10, 2002, ACCORDING TO THE ELECTORAL ACT.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL CALLS FOR PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>NOMINATIONS TO BE SUBMITTED TO A NOMINATION COURT, WHICH </p><p>CAN RECEIVE THEM UNTIL JANUARY 31.  THE LAST POLLING DAY </p><p>PERMITTED UNDER THE ELECTORAL ACT IS MARCH 17, ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE LEGAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION, A WELL-RESPECTED </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN NGO SPECIALIZING IN LEGAL ISSUES.  THERE MUST </p><p>BE AT LEAST A TWO-WEEK PERIOD BETWEEN THE POLLING DAYS </p><p>AND THE END OF THE PRESIDENT\'S TERM, WHICH OCCURS ON </p><p>MARCH 31. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MUGABE\'S PRONOUNCEMENT OF A MARCH ELECTION COMES </p><p>AS NO GREAT SURPRISE.  MUGABE APPEARS INTENT ON STICKING </p><p>TO THE ELECTION SCHEDULE SPELLED OUT IN THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>AND ELECTORAL ACT IN AN ATTEMPT TO SHOW CRITICS HE IS A </p><p>"TRUE DEMOCRAT."  BY OUR RECKONING, THE ELECTION IS </p><p>LIKELY TO FALL ON THE WEEKEND OF MARCH 16-17, WHICH </p><p>WOULD GIVE MUGABE THE MAXIMUM TIME TO ORGANIZE HIS </p><p>SUPPORTERS AND PLAN FOR ELECTORAL CONTINGENCIES. </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S RAINY SEASON SHOULD BE WANING BY THE MIDDLE </p><p>OF MARCH, WHICH REDUCES THE CHANCES THAT FLOODS AND </p><p>WASHED-OUT BRIDGES COULD KEEP MUGABE\'S PREDOMINANTLY </p><p>RURAL SUPPORTERS AWAY FROM THE POLLING BOOTHS.  THE </p><p>TIMING MAY ALSO DEPEND ON LOOMING FOOD SHORTAGES.

WE NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT THE U.S. DID </p><p>NOT NUMBER AMONG THOSE COUNTRIES THAT WILL BE INVITED TO </p><p>SEND ELECTION OBSERVERS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
