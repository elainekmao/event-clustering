Muslim </p><p>politicians have threatened to boycott Parliament if the </p><p>GSL does not address the situation.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>Violence in the East </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Violence between Muslims and Liberation Tigers </p><p>of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) supporters erupted in the Mutur </p><p>area of eastern Sri Lanka, April 17-18.  (Note:  Mutur </p><p>is a Muslim-dominated town in Trincomalee District.  The </p><p>population on the outskirts of the town is Tamil, with </p><p>much of Mutur\'s hinterland controlled by the LTTE.)  As </p><p>with most communal incidents of this sort, the origins </p><p>of the flare-up are murky, but seem to involve the </p><p>abduction of two Muslims by the LTTE on March 31.  After </p><p>the mother of one of the men committed suicide in </p><p>protest, tensions escalated into out-and-out fighting </p><p>between Muslims and LTTE cadre.  In the fighting, at </p><p>least three Muslims and two LTTE supporters were </p><p>reportedly slain.  (Note:  The two men who were abducted </p><p>are missing and believed dead.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In reaction to news of the fighting, the </p><p>government dispatched police and army reinforcements to </p><p>Mutur to put a lid on the situation.  Local curfews were </p><p>imposed and the security situation had calmed down </p><p>appreciably by April 19-20.  Based on what we are </p><p>hearing from contacts, including Interior Secretary M.N. </p><p>Junaid, however, tensions remain extremely high in Mutur </p><p>and in the rest of the ethnically-fractured east.  In </p><p>addition, the fighting left at least several hundred </p><p>Muslims displaced, as many shops and homes were torched </p><p>in the fighting.  The government is grappling with the </p><p>humanitarian situation now. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In the meantime, the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM) is trying to cool the </p><p>situation down, asking the LTTE and local Muslims to </p><p>meet to discuss their differences.  The LTTE agreed to </p><p>this, asking Muslims to come to meet them in LTTE- </p><p>controlled territory.  Muslims, upset over the venue, </p><p>turned down the LTTE offer.  The SLMM continues to try </p><p>to arrange a meeting. </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>Political Fallout </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The political fallout from the violence was </p><p>immediate.  Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader Rauf </p><p>Hakeem traveled to the Mutur area and announced that he </p><p>would boycott Parliament if the government did not step </p><p>in to address the situation right away.  (Note:  The </p><p>United National Front government is reliant on SLMC </p><p>support in Parliament for its slim majority.)  Although </p><p>he later backed off this threat, Hakeem\'s pointed </p><p>comments were noticed and the government quickly sent a </p><p>cabinet-level team to the east to look into the </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) (((Note:  Tensions between the SLMC and the </p><p>government were already high before Mutur exploded into </p><p>violence.  A public spat took place between pro- </p><p>government Muslim and SLMC MPs early last week, with </p><p>both sides slinging mud at the other.  The exact context </p><p>of the verbal attacks was unclear, but Hakeem was </p><p>clearly insulted and said so publicly.  End Note.))) </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) After a lull in violence between the two sides </p><p>that lasted several months, Muslim-Tiger relations have </p><p>nose-dived again.  Even beyond the local situation in </p><p>Mutur, the ramifications of such violence are serious, </p><p>as instability in the east serves to undermine the peace </p><p>process in general.  Moreover, the latest violence is </p><p>not a constructive prelude to the seventh round of peace </p><p>talks slated to take place April 29 - May 2 in Thailand. </p><p>(Note:  There have been some unconfirmed press reports </p><p>that the Tigers may want to postpone this round of </p><p>talks.)   END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
