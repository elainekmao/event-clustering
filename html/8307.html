Bringing to focus </p><p>the changing regional scales after the U.S. campaign against </p><p>Iraq, Gul will call for democratization, transparency, fair </p><p>distribution of natural resources, equality between the </p><p>sexes, and enhanced education, papers say.  Gul will </p><p>underline the problems caused by the current political rule </p><p>in Islamic countries, and will urge his Iranian and Syrian </p><p>counterparts to support the process of change and attempt </p><p>democratization, reports note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Greece, Turkey disagree on Aegean: Dailies point to the </p><p>`fresh\' tiff between Ankara and Athens over the Aegean. </p><p>Papers believe Greece wanted a new phase by carrying the </p><p>Aegean problems to the EU.  "Cumhuriyet" reports about some </p><p>messages by TGS Chief General Ozkok the other day: Turkey </p><p>prefers betterment of ties with Greece, but provocative </p><p>policies pursued by Athens harmed bilateral ties, Ozkok has </p><p>said, adding that the Greek effort to expand its airspace </p><p>and territorial waters was provocation.  Dailies report the </p><p>Greek Prime Minister Simitis blaming Turkey on Tuesday for </p><p>following aggressive policies.  `We have shown the world </p><p>that Turkey has been ignoring international regulation.  Our </p><p>pressure made Ankara see that it had no option but abide by </p><p>international rules,\' Simitis reportedly said.  Greek </p><p>Foreign Minister Papandreou has also criticized Turkey for </p><p>violations in the Aegean.  Responding to a question, </p><p>Papandreou said that in democracies, the military had to be </p><p>subject to political power, not vice versa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC meeting: The National Security Council (NSC) will </p><p>convene today to discuss the partisan bureaucratic </p><p>appointments by AKP, the threat of fundamentalism, Cyprus, </p><p>and EU reforms package.  The council is expected to finalize </p><p>the controversial `Repentance Law\' as well, papers say.  The </p><p>law envisages reduction in penalties for terror group </p><p>defectors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: U.S. intervention to get a Kurd elected as the </p><p>governor of Kirkuk caused Arabs to boycott the local polls </p><p>in the oil-rich Northern Iraqi town, papers say.  The </p><p>Turkoman candidate has a narrow chance of winning the </p><p>election because of the `unbalanced\' structure of the town </p><p>council, reports note.  The American intervention has cast a </p><p>shadow on the polls, diminishing chances for ethnic peace in </p><p>the region, papers add.  Dailies also report that Secretary </p><p>of Defense Rumsfeld stressed that Iraq\'s neighbors would not </p><p>let Iraq turn into an Islamic republic, and that Iraq would </p><p>not become another Iran. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AIPAC at Istanbul panel: AIPAC representative Keith Wiessman </p><p>said at a business panel meeting in Istanbul on Tuesday that </p><p>henceforth, Washington expected from Turkey `action, not </p><p>words,\' reports "Zaman."  To repair ties, Wiessman advised </p><p>Turkey to `seek constructive cooperation with U.S. in Iraq, </p><p>improve relations with Israel, end interest in Arafat, and </p><p>support U.S. policy targeting Iranian WMD.\'  Turkey will be </p><p>supported to the extent it acted in line with U.S. </p><p>interests, Wiessman said according to Zaman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF Review: IMF Turkey Desk Chief Juha Kahkonen, who is in </p><p>Turkey for the latest IMF review, said that if economic </p><p>indicators continue appearing positive, Turkey might not </p><p>need the Fund\'s support after 2004.  Kahkonen has voiced </p><p>confidence that Turkey would reach macro economic targets, </p><p>papers report.  IMF\'s fifth review is to be concluded on </p><p>Friday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The new target </p><p>Sami Kohen noted in mass appeal "Milliyet" (5/28): "Even the </p><p>`hawks\' in Washington are not planning to hit Iran. .  The </p><p>hawks, including Secretary Rumsfeld are getting tougher on </p><p>Iran because of allegations about Tehran\'s backing of the </p><p>last month\'s al Qaida suicide attack in Saudi Arabia. . </p><p>Another reason is the concern that Iran was attempting to </p><p>exert influence on the Iraqi Shiites via their leader Al- </p><p>Haqim, who came back to Karbala from his long exile in Iran. </p><p>.  The Bush Administration might see the Iranian problem as </p><p>an opportunity to `test\' Turkey\'s closeness to the U.S. </p><p>After Iraq, this will be a tough test for Turkish diplomacy, </p><p>for Ankara would not want tension with Iran and Syria.  If </p><p>the Bush Administration chooses to compromise, instead of </p><p>fighting with Tehran, Ankara\'s good dialogue with both </p><p>countries might help U.S. to that end." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
