(C) IN RECENT WEEKS, THE INDEPENDENT PRESS HAS </p><p>CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE </p><p>(MDC) FOR FUMBLING ALONG WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF URGENCY OR </p><p>DIRECTION.  MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHQ NCUBQTRONGLY </p><p>REJECTED THE CRITICISM, SAYING SOME WERE UNDERSTANDABLY </p><p>FRUSTRATED WITH THE DETERIORATION OF THE ECONOMY AND </p><p>CONTINUED GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED LAWLESSNESS, AND WITH THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY\'S INABILITY TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.   HE </p><p>INSISTED THAT THE PARTY WAS ORGANIZING ENERGETICALLY IN </p><p>RUQL AREAS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  MDC MP TENDAI BITI ADMITTED THAT THE MDC HAD </p><p>BEEN ADRIFT FROM SEPTEMBER THROUGH DECEMBER, BUT CLAIMED </p><p>THAT IT HAD AWAKENED FROM ITS SLUMBER.  SINCE IT WON 57 </p><p>SEATS IN PARLIAMENT IN JUNE 2000, THE MDC APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>GAINED MIDDLE CLASS SUPPORT, AND SOME RURAL AREAS, WHERE </p><p>MANY ANGRY RESIDENTS WERE UNABLE TO AFFORD BREAD DURING THE </p><p>HOLIDAY SEASON, ARE PROVING TO BE INCREASINGLY FERTILE </p><p>GROUND.  AT THE SAME TIME, IN ORDER TO ASSUAGE SUPPORTERS </p><p>FRUSTRATED ABOUT THE LACK OF CHANGE, THE MDC MUST DO A </p><p>BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING TO ITS SUPPORTERS THE LIMITED ROLE </p><p>IT CAN PLAY AS AN OPPOSITION PARTY.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MDC ADRIFT?... </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  IN RECENT WEEKS, THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) HAS BEEN STRONGLY CRITICIZED IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00125  01 OF 03  091359Z </p><p>INDEPENDENT MEDIA FOR NOT ENERGETICALLY CONSOLIDATING ITS </p><p>SUPPORT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.   IN LATE DECEMBER, THE INFLUENTIAL WEEKLY "THE </p><p>FINANCIAL GAZETTE" CARRIED A STINGING FRONT PAGE STORY </p><p>URGING THE MDC TO SHAPE UP OR TO GO.  THE ARTICLE ACCUSED </p><p>THE OPPOSITION PARTY OF FUMBLING ALONG WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF </p><p>URGENCY OR DIRECTION, OF MAKING ILL-CONSIDERED PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS, AND OF LETTING ITS SUPPORTERS DOWN BY FAILING </p><p>TO PURSUE ITS LONG-PROMISED MASS ACTION.   ON JANUARY 3, </p><p>THE "DAILY NEWS" CARRIED A SCATHING POLITICAL CARTOON </p><p>ENTITLED "PREPARING FOR ELECTION 2002."  IT PORTRAYED THE </p><p>MDC AS A FAT MAN IN A DEEP SLUMBER OVER A SIGN SAYING "DO </p><p>NOT DISTURB, WE ONLY WAKE UP WHEN THERE IS BOOING TO DO IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT."  ZANU-PF, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS PORTRAYED AS </p><p>A MUSCLE-BOUND MAN LIFTING WEIGHTS INTENSIVELY IN </p><p>PREPARATION FOR 2002. </p><p> </p><p>...WHILE MUGABE CONSOLIDATES CONTROL OF ZANU-PF </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WHILE THE MDC APPEARED TO BE STUMBLING, PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE WAS BUSY CONSOLIDATING HIS CONTROL OVER THE RULING </p><p>PARTY.  HE USED ZANU-PF\'S EXTRAORDINARY CONGRESS IN </p><p>DECEMBER TO QUASH GROWING DISSENT WITH HIS LEADERSHIP, </p><p>ELEVATING TO THE PARTY\'S SUPREME DECISION-MAKING BODY CLOSE </p><p>ALLIES SUCH AS PARLIAMENT SPEAKER EMMERSON MNANGAGWA AND </p><p>YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MINISTER BORDER GEZI, AND EXPELLING </p><p>THOSE, SUCH AS EDDISON ZVOBGO, WHOSE LOYALTIES TO MUGABE </p><p>WERE WANING.  MUGABE ALSO SQUELCHED ANY POTENTIAL </p><p>CHALLENGES TO HIM AS THE PARTY\'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN </p><p>2002.  MUGABE\'S SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING OF HIS CONTROL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00125  01 OF 03  091359Z </p><p>OVER THE RULING PARTY, COMBINED WITH THE PARTY\'S VICTORY IN </p><p>THE SPECIAL PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IN MARONDERA IN NOVEMBER </p><p>(ALBEIT A VICTORY ACHIEVED THROUGH VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION) CONTRIBUTED TO A PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT ZANU- </p><p>PF HAD REGAINED A DEGREE OF POLITICAL MOMENTUM. </p><p> </p><p>CRISIS OF EXPECTATIONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MUCH OF THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA\'S CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>MDC IS ROOTED IN A GENUINE FRUSTRATION THAT, DESPITE THE </p><p>MDC\'S WINNING NEARLY HALF THE CONTESTED SEATS IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT, THE ECONOMY HAS CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED LAWLESSNESS IN RURAL AREAS HAS </p><p>CONTINUED UNABATED.  OUR MDC CONTACTS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>SOME OF THE CRITICISM WAS JUSTIFIED, BUT POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>IT IS SIMPLY UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT AN OPPOSITION PARTY </p><p>WITHOUT ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT RESOURCES -- AND IN DIRE </p><p>FINANCIAL STRAITS ITSELF -- TO DELIVER JOBS, BETTER ROADS, </p><p>AND HEALTH CARE.  MOREOVER, THESE CONTACTS INSISTED, THE </p><p>MDC IS NOW WORKING ENERGETICALLY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5113 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00125  02 OF 03  091359Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------B40202  091359Z /38 </p><p>P 091359Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7971 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000125 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 01/08/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWEAN OPPOSITION STRUGGLES TO COPE WITH </p><p>CRISIS OF EXPECTATIONS </p><p> </p><p>PREPARE FOR THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  TENDAI BITI, WHO REPRESENTS THE MDC IN PARLIAMENT </p><p>AND SERVES AS THE PARTY\'S SHADOW FOREIGN MINISTER, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00125  02 OF 03  091359Z </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PARTY EXPERIENCED A SLUMP FROM </p><p>SEPTEMBER THROUGH DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR.  HE ATTRIBUTED THE </p><p>SLUMP TO EXHAUSTION IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS AND TO A CRISIS OF LEADERSHIP, RESULTING FROM THE </p><p>ELECTION OF MANY OF THE MDC\'S MOST CAPABLE LEADERS TO </p><p>PARLIAMENT, AN INSTITUTION WHICH CONSUMED THEIR ATTENTION </p><p>AND ALLOWED LITTLE TIME FOR GRASS-ROOTS PARTY-BUILDING. </p><p>IN ADDITION, BITI CRITICIZED MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI FOR TAKING A NUMBER OF FOREIGN TRIPS THAT WERE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>NOT SANCTIONED BY THE PARTY AND DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE </p><p>CLEAR OBJECTIVES.  HE SINGLED OUT FOR PARTICULAR CRITICISM </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S MEETING WITH RENAMO LEADER DHLAKAMA IN SOUTH </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AFRICA, CALLING IT "COMPLETELY PREMATURE."   BITI ALSO </p><p>CRITICIZED SOME OF HIS MDC PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUES FOR NOT </p><p>MEETING FREQUENTLY ENOUGH WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE MDC IS CURRENTLY HAVING TO WALK A VERY NARROW </p><p>TIGHTROPE.  IF THE PARTY MOVES TOO AGGRESSIVELY IN </p><p>ORGANIZING MASS ACTION INTENDED TO PRESSURE PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE TO STEP DOWN, THE GOVERNMENT ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD </p><p>RESPOND WITH OVERWHELMING FORCE, CAUSING SIGNIFICANT </p><p>BLOODSHED AND PROVIDING A PRETEXT TO CLOSE DOWN THE MDC, </p><p>WHICH COULD SET BACK THE PARTY\'S DEVELOPMENT SEVERAL YEARS. </p><p>ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE OPPOSITION PARTY MOVES TOO SLOWLY </p><p>IN PRESSING FOR CHANGE, IT RISKS ALIENATING ITS SUPPORTERS. </p><p>THE BEST WAY TO NEGOTIATE THAT TIGHTROPE SUCCESSFULLY, BITI </p><p>BELIEVED, IS TO RETURN TO BASICS BY IDENTIFYING THE ISSUES </p><p>OF CORE CONCERN TO ORDINARY ZIMBABWEANS -- THE ECONOMY, </p><p>INCLUDING THE LAND ISSUE, MISGOVERNANCE, AND THE NEED FOR </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM -- AND TO COMMUNICATE REGULARLY WITH </p><p>VOTERS A CLEAR MDC POSITION ON THOSE ISSUES.  BITI NOTED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00125  02 OF 03  091359Z </p><p>THAT THE MDC\'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD AGREED TO </p><p>FORM FOR EACH PROVINCE OUTREACH TEAMS CHARGED WITH TAKING </p><p>THE MDC\'S MESSAGE TO RURAL ZIMBABWEANS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN A JANUARY 5 CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF, MDC </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE STRONGLY DISAGREED WITH </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE ASSESSMENT THAT THE MDC IS RESTING ON ITS LAURELS.  HE </p><p>ATTRIBUTED THAT PERCEPTION PRIMARILY TO INDEPENDENT MEDIA </p><p>JOURNALISTS WHO, HE SAID, HAD BECOME INCREASINGLY </p><p>FRUSTRATED WITH THE MDC\'S INABILITY TO EFFECT ANY </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S DISASTROUS POLICIES. </p><p>NCUBE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE OPPOSITION PARTY COULD HAVE </p><p>DONE A BETTER JOB OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE MEDIA, AND WAS </p><p>MOVING TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTCOMING BY ORGANIZING MEETINGS </p><p>BETWEEN THE SENIOR MDC LEADERSHIP AND THE EDITORS OF THE </p><p>MAJOR INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPERS.  NCUBE REGRETTED THAT </p><p>"CARELESS" STATEMENTS BY MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI </p><p>HAD PROVIDED RICH FODDER FOR CRITICISM, PARTICULARLY </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S PREDICTION THAT MUGABE WOULD BE OUT OF OFFICE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BY DECEMBER 2000. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  NCUBE INSISTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE MDC HAD WORKED </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY TO STRENGTHEN ITS SUPPORT SINCE THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS LAST JUNE.   HE AND PARTY VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA, HE SAID, HAD SPENT EVERY WEEKEND </p><p>SINCE JUNE IN CITIES AND TOWNS THROUGHOUT ZIMBABWE CARRYING </p><p>THE MDC\'S MESSAGE, AND HE HAD OBSERVED A NOTICEABLE </p><p>INCREASE IN THE NUMBERS AND DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE AT THEIR </p><p>RALLIES.   AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE PARTY\'S GROWING </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL STRENGTH, NCUBE POINTED OUT THAT THE MDC NOW </p><p>HAS IN PLACE IN MOST OF ZIMBABWE\'S EIGHT PROVINCES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00125  02 OF 03  091359Z </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES AT THE VILLAGE, WARD, AND CAPITAL CITY </p><p>LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>MASVINGO KEY PROVINCE IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ACCORDING TO NCUBE, THE MDC IS NOW FOCUSING </p><p>INTENSIVELY ON BUILDING SUPPORT FOR THE UPCOMING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE MDC BELIEVES IT CURRENTLY </p><p>ENJOYS 90% SUPPORT IN MATABELELAND NORTH AND MATABELELAND </p><p>SOUTH, 55-65% SUPPORT IN MIDLANDS, 60-70% IN MANICALAND, </p><p>AND 50% IN MASVINGO.  THE PARTY HOPES IT CAN WIN 35-40% OF </p><p>THE VOTES IN ZANU-PF\'S STRONGHOLDS IN MASHONALAND EAST, </p><p>WEST, AND CENTRAL, BUT NCUBE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THAT WOULD BE AN </p><p>UPHILL STRUGGLE, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT\'S TACTIC </p><p>OF INTIMIDATING OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS INTO STAYING AWAY </p><p>FROM THE POLLS.   IN THE END, NCUBE IS CONVINCED THAT </p><p>MASVINGO WILL BE THE KEY BATTLEGROUND PROVINCE, AS IT IS </p><p>THE MOST POPULOUS AND BECAUSE THE RECENT EXPULSION OF </p><p>NATIVE SON POLITICIAN EDDISON ZVOBGO FROM THE ZANU-PF </p><p>POLITBURO MIGHT NUDGE FENCE-SITTING VOTERS INTO THE MDC </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5115 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00125  03 OF 03  091400Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------B40221  091400Z /38 </p><p>P 091359Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7972 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000125 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 01/08/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWEAN OPPOSITION STRUGGLES TO COPE WITH </p><p>CRISIS OF EXPECTATIONS </p><p> </p><p>CAMP. </p><p> </p><p>MDC GAINING STRENGTH </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00125  03 OF 03  091400Z </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS AGREE THAT THE PARTY REMAINS </p><p>POPULAR, ALTHOUGH THE MDC HAS MUCH WORK TO DO TO </p><p>CONSOLIDATE ITS GAINS OF LAST JUNE.  UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>POLITICAL SCIENTIST JOHN MAKUMBE MAINTAINS THAT THE MDC HAS </p><p>GAINED STRENGTH SINCE JUNE.  ACCORDING TO MAKUMBE, MANY </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS WHO SYMPATHIZED WITH THE MDC DID NOT VOTE FOR </p><p>IT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT THINK IT STOOD A CHANCE, AND WERE </p><p>GREATLY SURPRISED WHEN THE PARTY WON 57 SEATS.  AS A RESULT </p><p>OF THE MDC\'S ELECTORAL SUCCESS, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF </p><p>VOTERS ARE NOW CONVINCED THAT THE PARTY PROVIDES A CREDIBLE </p><p>ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT REGIME.  IN PARTICULAR, THE MDC </p><p>IS GAINING GROUND AMONG THE MIDDLE CLASS, WHICH DURING THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY CAMPAIGN WAS SKEPTICAL OF MORGAN TSVANGIRAI\'S </p><p>INTELLECTUAL HEFT, BUT IS NOW CONVINCED AFTER THE "ANNUS </p><p>HORRIBILIS" OF 2000 THAT "EVEN AN IDIOT WOULD BE BETTER </p><p>THAN MUGABE."   MAKUMBE CONTENDED THAT THE MDC IS BEGINNING </p><p>TO ATTRACT SUPPORT FROM BLACK AND WHITE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>BUSINESSMEN LIVING ABROAD WHO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THE </p><p>PARTY WOULD PURSUE RATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIES, AND TO MAKE </p><p>INROADS WITH INCREASINGLY ANGRY RURAL RESIDENTS, MANY OF </p><p>WHOM COULD NOT EVEN AFFORD TO BUY BREAD DURING THE HOLIDAY </p><p>SEASON.   IN ADDITION, ACCORDING TO MAKUMBE, THE MDC IS </p><p>DEMONSTRATING MATURITY BY TRYING TO WOO THE ARMY, BOTH VIA </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE MILITARY, </p><p>AND IN QUIET BEHIND-THE-SCENES DISCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) FOR AN OPPOSITION PARTY THAT IS LITTLE MORE THAN A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00125  03 OF 03  091400Z </p><p>YEAR OLD, THE MDC HAS ACHIEVED SOME IMPRESSIVE INROADS.  IT </p><p>CONVINCED VOTERS TO REJECT A DRAFT CONSTITUTION THAT WOULD </p><p>HAVE FURTHER STRENGTHENED PRESIDENTIAL POWERS.  IT WON 57 </p><p>OF THE 120 CONTESTED SEATS IN PARLIAMENT, BREATHING NEW </p><p>LIFE INTO AN INSTITUTION THAT HAD BEEN MERELY A RUBBER </p><p>STAMP FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, SUBJECTING THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO SCRUTINY AND GENERATING A NEW INTEREST IN PARLIAMENT AND </p><p>POLITICS.  THE MDC HAS PROVIDED AN ALTERNATIVE VOICE TO </p><p>ZANU-PF, AND PARLIAMENT HAS PROVIDED LEGITIMACY TO THAT </p><p>VOICE.  ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY, HOWEVER, -- THE </p><p>FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE -- IS BEING CONDUCTED </p><p>EXTRANEOUS TO PARLIAMENT -- AND, INDEED, THE JUDICIAL </p><p>BRANCH -- AS GOVERNMENT RESOURCES ARE OSTENSIBLY BEING </p><p>DEPLOYED IN SUPPORT OF THE LAWLESSNESS ON COMMERCIAL FARMS. </p><p>IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE MDC\'S OWN RELEVANCE THAT THE PARTY </p><p>SHIFT THE DEBATE ON LAND BACK INTO PARLIAMENT.  SHINING A </p><p>SPOTLIGHT ON THE DELETERIOUS IMPACT OF THE FAST TRACK </p><p>APPROACH ON THE ECONOMY AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND OFFERING A </p><p>CLEAR, RATIONAL ALTERNATIVE PROGRAM WOULD HAVE A POWERFUL </p><p>RESONANCE WITH THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF ZIMBABWEANS WHO </p><p>ARE FED UP WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLITICAL MANIPULATION OF </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THE MDC REMAINS POPULAR, AS FRUSTRATION MOUNTS IN </p><p>MOST SECTORS OF ZIMBABWE\'S POPULATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>POLICIES.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE MDC LEADERSHIP RECOGNIZES </p><p>THAT, IF IT INTENDS TO REMAIN VIABLE AND REGAIN POLITICAL </p><p>MOMENTUM, IT HAS SOME PUBLIC RELATIONS WORK TO DO WITH ITS </p><p>SUPPORTERS -- VIA THE INDEPENDENT PRESS, WORD OF MOUTH, AND </p><p>REGULAR MEETINGS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY -- IN EXPLAINING </p><p>WHAT ROLE IT CAN PLAY AS AN OPPOSITION PARTY AND THAT IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00125  03 OF 03  091400Z </p><p>CANNOT BRING THE KIND OF CHANGE THEY ARE DEMANDING WHILE IN </p><p>THE MINORITY. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
