<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 002179 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, April 10, report </p><p>on the fall of the Iraqi regime in Baghdad.  Subdued </p><p>front-page headlines highlight the American forces\' </p><p>control over the Iraqi capital and the "puzzling" </p><p>absence of Iraqi leadership figures.  Reports also </p><p>focus on scenes of the Iraqi people\'s jubilation, </p><p>looting, and demolishing of monuments of the Iraqi </p><p>regime that took place in some Iraqi cities.  Front </p><p>pages of two Arabic dailies carried the photo of </p><p>Saddam Hussein\'s statue as it was draped with the </p><p>American flag in Baghdad by U.S. soldiers.  All papers </p><p>also highlight King Abdullah\'s call for a "national </p><p>effort" to help the Iraqi people and to provide </p><p>immediate medical and food assistance.  The editorial </p><p>commentary today can be described as bewildered and </p><p>bitter. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Why?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/10):  "It might be too hard for the mind to </p><p>function under these circumstances, and yet, the </p><p>question that is asked by every Arab, the question </p><p>that is addressed to all governments, politicians and </p><p>regular citizens is this: why did the Iraqis prefer </p><p>the occupation over staying under the authority of the </p><p>regime?  It is a hard lesson that must be understood </p><p>by some of the Arab regimes.  Managing a country with </p><p>an iron fist and violating people\'s freedoms may give </p><p>the impression of steadfast stability, but at the </p><p>first challenge, the falseness goes away and the truth </p><p>that the people are so far away from the regime and </p><p>that their only hope is getting rid of the oppression, </p><p>even through an occupier, becomes clear.  These are </p><p>difficult times for the Arabs outside Iraq, those who </p><p>are probably more shocked than the Iraqis themselves. </p><p>This is because we were listening to fiery speeches </p><p>and have failed to understand the reality of the Iraqi </p><p>people\'s feelings and suffering..  The Iraqi feelings </p><p>now are those of redemption and salvation, and as such </p><p>are not logical.  The reality, however, is that of an </p><p>occupation and that will take time to be absorbed by </p><p>the Iraqis.  I wonder how they will deal with the </p><p>American occupation presence in the days to come and </p><p>how they will handle it when they find out that they </p><p>were moved from a dictatorship to an occupation." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The surprise/the puzzle" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/10):  "By all standards, we view the `battle\' of </p><p>Baghdad as a puzzle and a surprise.  The battle, over </p><p>which the whole world held its breath, did not happen, </p><p>and the collapse was quick and horrific.  It may be a </p><p>long time before we learn the facts of what went on.. </p><p>If we had the courage, we would say that the final </p><p>outcome of the war was expected from the beginning. </p><p>We would also say that we had wished the war would </p><p>have taken a different turn, for America\'s arrogance </p><p>could only be broken by the strikes of the resistance </p><p>and major losses.  And this, unfortunately, did not </p><p>happen." </p><p> </p><p>-- "America bombs Palestine in Baghdad!" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Hilmi Al-Asmar writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al- </p><p>Dustour (04/10):  "America and Israel alone are re- </p><p>producing colonization in its original form, and alone </p><p>maintain the most brutal of human heritage, namely the </p><p>occupation..  America and Israel are two `states\' </p><p>whose laws are founded upon the concept of the </p><p>`colonizer\' that rejects human laws..  We, in Jordan, </p><p>stand now between two Sharons, to the east and to the </p><p>west, and thus must prepare for the worst, which is </p><p>yet to come." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Between Gaza and Baghdad" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Usama Sharif writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/10):  "Killing reporters on purpose to scare </p><p>others and drive them away from Baghdad reminds us of </p><p>Israel and its crimes in Palestine.  Yesterday, </p><p>America committed a heinous crime against the media </p><p>and this day should never be forgotten..  Between this </p><p>occupation [U.S. occupation of Iraq] and that </p><p>[Israel\'s occupation of Palestine], much blood is </p><p>spilled, while mouths keep quiet, and we only see the </p><p>desperate faces of leaders bragging about justice and </p><p>freedom that they bring to whomever they choose and </p><p>withhold from whomever they choose..  The Bush-Blair </p><p>meeting in Northern Ireland is a new Yalta meeting </p><p>that precedes a new Potsdam in Baghdad.  There were no </p><p>Iraqis present at the meeting.  There was no need to </p><p>bring in the Iraqis, for these are issues to be </p><p>determined at a level higher than that of the people </p><p>concerned.  I have never heard such nonsense as that </p><p>being uttered by Blair and Bush.  What freedom, </p><p>independence and justice is this?  The price of </p><p>usurping Iraq is high.  Lives lost, money squandered </p><p>and a campaign gone bad.  Where do they come up with </p><p>this nonsense?  How did America and Britain become a </p><p>new Israel?  How did America fall down this way and </p><p>smeared itself with the blood of the innocent?  Is </p><p>this the answer to the September 11 attacks?  Has the </p><p>war machine vindicated itself by spilling the blood of </p><p>the Iraqis?  America and Israel are equal now and the </p><p>occupation in both cases is a sick impression of the </p><p>downfall of civilization and morality.  May the </p><p>Americans and the British enjoy this victory of </p><p>theirs, for it shall be a crown of thorns that would </p><p>bloody their foreheads.  In the heart of what is left </p><p>of this nation boils a blind anger that would condemn </p><p>to damnation everything around it and forebears a long- </p><p>awaited volcano.  They have badly wounded Iraq, but </p><p>they have not killed it.  History may do injustice to </p><p>the victim but its legacy shall never have mercy on </p><p>the executioner." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Is it a play?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(04/10):  "Amman cried hard over what it witnessed. </p><p>Amman cried over the fall of Baghdad as it did the </p><p>fall of Jerusalem.  It has become our destiny to cry </p><p>the fall of capitals, cities and dignity and to be </p><p>shoved from one defeat to another.  The tragedy is </p><p>repeated; one defeat after another; one treachery </p><p>after another; one betrayal after another.  The </p><p>invaders come across the seas to liberate, to rule, to </p><p>divide and to impose a status quo.  It has reached the </p><p>point where Arabs cannot differentiate between an </p><p>occupation and a liberation.  The capital of the </p><p>Abassid Caliphate is now in the hands of the soldiers </p><p>and Baghdad sinks into occupation, as it did at the </p><p>hands of Holako [emperor of the Mongols].  Tears and </p><p>pain will do us no good, for these are the tears of </p><p>the helpless and the pains of those suffering from </p><p>defeat.  We used to believe that if a person believes </p><p>in his homeland, he would not give up to the death. </p><p>But is there anyone who believes in the homeland, or </p><p>does the homeland become worthless when its people are </p><p>turned into slaves?  Where is the Iraqi resistance? </p><p>Where is the translation of all the words we have </p><p>heard over the long years?  Where are the millions, </p><p>the weapons, the slogans?  They have disappeared into </p><p>thin air.  How does Jabalia [refugee camp in Gaza] </p><p>fight Israeli tanks for months on end with hands armed </p><p>only with willpower, faith and the love of the </p><p>homeland, and Baghdad does not?  Baghdad is now losing </p><p>its head, its memory and its history, and in its name </p><p>much will be signed, before it wakes up.  Baghdad is a </p><p>prisoner and the prisoner does not represent himself. </p><p>Talking about its freedom is an illusion.  Baghdad </p><p>will sign on to many accords, to which death may be </p><p>easier.  Sharon will be waiting for these signatures </p><p>and for other things.  With the disappearance of old </p><p>Baghdad, many teams from the Arab world may also </p><p>disappear.  The only beneficiary from this war that </p><p>led to the occupation of Iraq is Israel, the right- </p><p>wing Likud and Sharon.  Iraq\'s occupation will be </p><p>President Bush\'s gift to them.  The awakening of the </p><p>drunk is inevitable and we shall see how tables will </p><p>turn and how the meaning of the word liberation shall </p><p>glitter." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
