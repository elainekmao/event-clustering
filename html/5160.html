<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000200 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: TSPA, TSPL, PREL, ECPS, ETRD, IT, EUN, NATO, AVIATION </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY MORE RECEPTIVE TO GALILEO M-CODE OVERLAY </p><p>CONCERNS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 259165 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00200  170905Z </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) GALILEO AND THE M-CODE OVERLAY ISSUE CAME UP DURING </p><p>SEPARATE MEETINGS ON JANUARY 14 AND 15 ON OTHER ISSUES </p><p>(REPORTED SEPTEL) WITH MINISTER OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES </p><p>(I.E. INDUSTRY) MARZANO AND GIOVANNI BRAUZZI, HEAD OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN MFA NATO AFFAIRS OFFICE. MARZANO DISPLAYED CLEAR </p><p>INTEREST IN THE ISSUE DURING A BRIEF JANUARY 15 DISCUSSION </p><p>WITH ECMIN OF REFTEL TALKING POINTS AND THE USG WHITE PAPER. </p><p>HE INSTRUCTED HIS SUBORDINATES TO CONTACT OTHER ITALIAN </p><p>MINISTRIES INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE, AND MAY CONVENE AN </p><p>INTERAGENCY MEETING ON THE SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DURING A JANUARY 14 MEETING, BRAUZZI TOLD POL-MIL </p><p>OFFICER THAT ITALY AGREES THAT NATO AND THE EU SHOULD WORK </p><p>TOGETHER TO RESOLVE THE M-CODE IMPASSE.  THE GOI WAS VERY </p><p>DISAPPOINTED WITH FRANCE\'S MANEUVERING DURING RECENT NATO </p><p>DISCUSSIONS OF ALTERNATIVES, HE ADDED.  FRANCE HAD </p><p>OVER-EMPHASIZED SEVERAL POINTS THAT STYMIED A PRELIMINARY </p><p>AGREEMENT AT NATO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL. SEVERAL </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE NATO C3 BOARD DID NOT SEEM FAMILIAR WITH THE </p><p>USG WHITE PAPER PROPOSALS, ACCORDING TO BRAUZZI, WHICH HAD </p><p>SLOWED DISCUSSIONS CONSIDERABLY.  HE CLAIMED THAT ITALY HAS </p><p>BEEN ACTIVE IN NATO ON GALILEO AND HAS TRIED TO PLAY A </p><p>POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BRAUZZI EMPHASIZED THAT ITALY AND, HE SAID, THE EU </p><p>WANT TO PROCEED WITH TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE US TO </p><p>REACH AN AGREEMENT.  THE USG PROPOSAL FOR THE EU TO NEGOTIATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00200  170905Z </p><p>FREQUENCY USE WITH RUSSIA WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE; THERE ISN\'T THE </p><p>SAME DEGREE OF INTEROPERABILITY WITH THE RUSSIANS, HE SAID, </p><p>WHICH MAKES REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE RUSSIANS UNLIKELY. </p><p> WITH THE BERLIN PLUS BOTTLENECK FREED, BRAUZZI SAID THE </p><p>DEBATE ON GALILEO SHOULD MOVE FORWARD SUBSTANTIVELY TO ENSURE </p><p>EU-NATO INTEROPERABILITY AND MILITARY SECURITY.  WHAT WOULD </p><p>FURTHER M-CODE DISCUSSIONS IS EVIDENCE THAT THE USG SEES </p><p>GALILEO AS A "COMMON" ASSET THAT EXPANDS THE ALLIANCE\'S </p><p>CAPABILITIES, BRAUZZI COMMENTED.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE </p><p>COMPETITIVE ASPECTS OF GPS AND GALILEO, BUT SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>THE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AND MODALITIES COULD BE RESOLVED IN A </p><p>MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL WAY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  COMMENT: POST IS NOT IN A POSITION TO EVALUATE </p><p>BRAUZZI\'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE EU, BUT WE DO DETECT A MORE </p><p>OPEN-MINDED NOTE IN BOTH MARZANO\'S AND BRAUZZI\'S RESPONSES ON </p><p>THE M-CODE ISSUE THAN WE HAVE HEARD BEFORE.  UNTIL NOW, THE </p><p>GOI HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE ON GALILEO AS A MILITARY </p><p>SECURITY ISSUE, DESPITE OUR EMPHASIS ON THE SERIOUS SECURITY </p><p>RISK POSED BY THE M-CODE OVERLAY PROBLEM.  EMBASSY EFFORTS TO </p><p>BROADEN GOI ATTENTION TO GALILEO BEYOND THE TRANSPORT </p><p>MINISTRY AND THE ITALIAN SPACE AGENCY (ASI), WHICH REMAIN </p><p>STAUNCH SUPPORTERS OF THE PROJECT, MAY BE GETTING THROUGH. </p><p>THE INDUSTRY MINISTRY\'S EQUITIES IN GALILEO LIE ALMOST </p><p>ENTIRELY IN THE JOBS IT WILL CREATE AND THE COMPETITIVE </p><p>BENEFITS TO THE ITALIAN AEROSPACE INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY IF </p><p>PRINCIPAL GALILEO PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN ITALY </p><p>AS THE GOI HOPES.  AS SUCH, THE MINISTRY CAN BE EXPECTED TO </p><p>SUPPORT ANY SOLUTION TO THE M-CODE PROBLEM THAT WILL MOVE THE </p><p>PROJECT FORWARD.  THE UPCOMING GPS TEAM VISIT IS WELL-TIMED </p><p>TO BUILD ON THE GOI\'S INCREASED WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00200  170905Z </p><p>REALISTIC ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE M-CODE OVERLAY </p><p>DISPUTE.   END COMMENT. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00200 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
