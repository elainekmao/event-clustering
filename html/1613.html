AT INDEPENDENCE IN 1980, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE INHERITED A </p><p>LANDMINE PROBLEM ALONG SOME OF ITS BORDERS, WHERE RHODESIAN </p><p>SECURITY SERVICES HAD LAID MINES TO HINDER OPERATIONS BY REBEL </p><p>GROUPS BASED IN MOZAMBIQUE AND ZAMBIA.  ALTHOUGH MINE CLEARANCE </p><p>BEGAN IN 1982 IN AFFECTED AREAS, THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT BEGIN TO </p><p>MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS UNTIL 1998, WHEN THE NATIONAL DEMINING </p><p>OFFICE (NDO) WAS FORMED TO COORDINATE NATIONAL DEMINING EFFORTS. </p><p>THE UNITED STATES PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL, AND </p><p>MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE NDO AND TO A NATIONAL MINE CLEARANCE </p><p>SQUADRON ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>SCOPE OF PROBLEM </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL DEMINING OFFICE, AN ESTIMATED 2.5 </p><p>MILLION MINES WERE IN THE GROUND AT INDEPENDENCE.  700,000 MINES </p><p>HAVE NOW BEEN REMOVED, LEAVING 1.8 MILLION STILL TO BE CLEARED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AT INDEPENDENCE, 656 SQUARE KILOMETERS WERE AFFECTED BY MINES </p><p>AT INDEPENDENCE.  OF THOSE, 237 SQUARE KILOMETERS HAVE NOW BEEN </p><p>CLEARED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE KILLED OR INJURED BY LANDMINES IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  IN 2000, HOWEVER, TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND TWO INJURED </p><p>IN TWO SEPARATE INCIDENTS INVOLVING LAND MINES.
