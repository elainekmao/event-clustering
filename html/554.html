<p>UNCLAS ULAANBAATAR 003683 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, MG </p><p>SUBJECT: ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOR MONGOLIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 338430 </p><p> </p><p>1. FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS POSED IN </p><p>REFTEL, PARA FIVE. </p><p> </p><p>2. A) MONGOLIA HAS EXPERIENCED NO REPORTED ACTS OF </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND IS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY PROSECUTION </p><p>OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>B) EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ANY EXTRADITIONS FROM MONGOLIA </p><p>OR REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION TO MONGOLIA FOR TERRORIST </p><p>OFFENSES. </p><p> </p><p>C) MONGOLIA HAS EXPERIENCED NO TERRORIST ACTS IN ITS </p><p>RECENT HISTORY. THERE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY SIGNIFICANT </p><p>IMPAIRMENTS TO EFFECTIVE MONGOLIAN PROSECUTION OF ACCUSED </p><p>TERRORISTS.  HOWEVER, MONGOLIA HAS EXTRADITION TREATIES </p><p>WITH ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, MOSTLY FORMER </p><p>EUROPEAN COMMUNIST STATES.  IN SOME CASES, THE GOM </p><p>CONSIDERS THAT THESE TREATIES HAVE LAPSED WITH THE CHANGE </p><p>IN GOVERNMENT IN THE OTHER SIGNATORY STATE BUT IS SEEKING </p><p>TO RENEW THEM. </p><p> </p><p>D) MONGOLIA HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION OR </p><p>PROSECUTION OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST CASES.  THE GOM </p><p>CONDEMNS TERRORISM IN ALL ITS FORMS AND HAS PUBLICLY </p><p>DENOUNCED MAJOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTS. </p><p> </p><p>E) EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ANY MONGOLIAN COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN IN 1992. </p><p> </p><p>F) THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY MONGOLIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF ANY KIND.  CHINESE </p><p>SOURCES HAVE CRITICIZED THE ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT OF </p><p>PRIVATE MONGOLIAN CITIZENS AND GROUPS IN SUPPORT OF INNER </p><p>MONGOLIAN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE FROM CHINESE </p><p>RULE. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT MONGOLIA HAS </p><p>SERVED AS A BASE FOR ANY VIOLENT ACTS AGAINST CHINESE </p><p>RULE. </p><p> </p><p>G. MONGOLIA MAINTAINS EMBASSIES IN NORTH KOREA AND CUBA; </p><p>BOTH OF THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE EMBASSIES IN ULAANBAATAR. </p><p>DURING 1992, THE GOM PERIODICALLY EXCHANGED </p><p>CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES ON NATIONAL OCCASIONS WITH BOTH </p><p>REGIMES BUT DID NOT EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE POLICIES OR </p><p>POSITIONS OF EITHER GOVERNMENT. MONGOLIA HAS DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS WITH SYRIA, IRAN, IRAQ AND LIBYA BUT MAINTAINS </p><p>NO RESIDENT EMBASSIES IN THOSE COUNTRIES NOR ARE THEY </p><p>REPRESENTED IN MONGOLIA. MONGOLIA HAS NOT EXPRESSED </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE POLICIES OF ANY OF THESE COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>H. NO CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE.  IT REMAINS FIRMLY </p><p>OPPOSED TO TERRORISM FOR ANY PURPOSE AND IN ANY FORM. </p><p> </p><p>I. MONGOLIA HAS NEVER MAINTAINED A DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN </p><p>LIBYA NOR HAVE LIBYAN DIPLOMATS VISITED MONGOLIA IN 1992. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LAKE </p><p></p></div>
