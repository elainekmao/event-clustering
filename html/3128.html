<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: MULTIPLE REASONS BEHIND ARREST OF LAW </p><p>SOCIETY PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Todd Faulk for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: On June 11, Law Society of Zimbabwe </p><p>President Sternford Moyo described to poloff in detail his </p><p>June 3-5 detention by Zimbabwe Republic Police and the </p><p>farcical court proceedings that resulted in his release.  The </p><p>Law Society Secretary, Wilbert Mapombere, was also arrested </p><p>and held during this period, and on June 4, police arrested </p><p>and interrogated the entire staff of the Law Society for </p><p>about four hours.  Moyo stated that the police clearly did </p><p>not have a case, the evidence of his supposed involvement in </p><p>planning mass action with the opposition MDC and British High </p><p>Commission was fabricated, and that the Government caused </p><p>High Court Judge President Paddington Garwe, who oversaw his </p><p>case, to keep Moyo and Mapombere on remand in spite of the </p><p>lack of evidence.  There are a number of reasons the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe is trying to intimidate him now, Moyo </p><p>speculated, including his resistance to a planned Government </p><p>takeover of the Law Society and his plans to speak out in </p><p>international fora on the deterioration of the rule of law in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>The First Arrest </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On June 11, poloff met with Law Society of Zimbabwe </p><p>(LSZ) President Sternford Moyo in the offices of his law firm </p><p>Scanlen & Holderness to discuss his June 3-5 detention and </p><p>the reasons behind it.  Moyo is one of the most respected </p><p>lawyers in Zimbabwe and through the LSZ, which represents </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s legal profession, he has been a steadfast defender </p><p>of the rule of law in Zimbabwe.  In the early afternoon of </p><p>June 3, police arrested Law Society Secretary Wilbert </p><p>Mapombere.  While Moyo was attempting to arrange legal </p><p>representation for Mapombere, a squad of riot police burst </p><p>into his law firm office with a search warrant and said he </p><p>was under arrest for violating the Public Order and Security </p><p>Act (POSA).  Moyo protested that their warrant was very vague </p><p>and their search would violate attorney-client privilege; </p><p>they searched his office anyway, but did not find anything of </p><p>interest.  The police then took Moyo to his residence in the </p><p>suburb of Kambanji, presented another search warrant (that </p><p>had the wrong street number on it), and searched those </p><p>premises.  There, the police took a paper Moyo had presented </p><p>in April to the SADC Lawyers Association conference in </p><p>Livingstone, Zambia.  The police officers then conveyed Moyo </p><p>to Harare Central Prison, where he briefly spoke to several </p><p>lawyers who were not given the specific reasons for his </p><p>arrest.  Police inspectors presented to Moyo two letters, one </p><p>supposedly signed by Mapombere and addressed to the British </p><p>High Commission, and another written to Moyo by MDC </p><p>Secretary-General Welshman Ncube.  The letter attributed to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Moyo, which was poorly written, in the third person, and </p><p>filled with grammatical and spelling errors, had him planning </p><p>to organize "peaceful mass action" with the support of the </p><p>MDC.  (Note: The MDC and British High Commission in Harare </p><p>have both patently denied ever writing or receiving such </p><p>letters and accused the GOZ of fabricating them.  End note.) </p><p>In a statement to the police, Moyo denied the authenticity of </p><p>the letters and noted the section of the POSA the police said </p><p>he had supposedly violated did not exist.  The inspectors </p><p>eventually agreed there was no reasonable cause for </p><p>continuing to detain Moyo, and released him about 10:30 pm </p><p>that evening, and Moyo returned home. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>The Second Arrest </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) After midnight the same evening, police officers </p><p>returned to Moyo\'s home and said they had been instructed to </p><p>detain him again.  In protest, Moyo called Attorney-General </p><p>Andrew Chigovera, who contacted Police Commissioner Augustine </p><p>Chihuri.  After about an hour, Chihuri called back and said </p><p>the officers who gave the orders could not be reached and </p><p>there was nothing he could do.  The police took Moyo to </p><p>Highlands police station, where his jacket, socks and shoes </p><p>were taken and he was placed in a smelly, unheated cell with </p><p>nine other prisoners.  When he asked if the water covering </p><p>the floor was clean, he was told it was the overflow from the </p><p>broken toilet.  The one blanket in the cell smelled of urine </p><p>and was covered with lice and fleas.  The cold and the stench </p><p>prevented Moyo from getting any sleep.  At about 7 am, June </p><p>4, he was transferred back to Harare Central Prison, where he </p><p>was booked.  Around 3 pm, police took him, Mapombere and the </p><p>five staff members of the Law Society (who were arrested </p><p>earlier in the afternoon) to Lake Chivero, a wilderness park </p><p>25 km west of Harare.  On the way, police officers told the </p><p>staff members they were going to a park filled with lions, </p><p>apparently in an attempt to frighten them into saying </p><p>something incriminating against Moyo or Mapombere.  Upon </p><p>arrival, the detainees were separated and four police </p><p>officers were assigned to each staff member, and they were </p><p>each taken to a different area of the park.  They were </p><p>interrogated about Moyo\'s and Mapombere\'s activities for four </p><p>hours, but none of them said anything incriminating.  At </p><p>about 8 pm, they were all returned to Harare, where the staff </p><p>members were released; Moyo and Mapombere were taken to </p><p>separate police stations for another night in jail. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Courtroom Antics </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In the morning of June 5, Moyo--who had not been </p><p>offered food or water during his detention or given access to </p><p>his attorneys since his first arrest--was taken to the High </p><p>Court for a hearing.  During the proceedings, the prosecutor </p><p>complained to Justice Garwe (also the Judge President of the </p><p>High Court) that the police had consistently refused to give </p><p>him reasons for the detention of the Law Society leaders. </p><p>(Note: Moyo heard later that Garwe had repeatedly delayed the </p><p>hearing to give the police and the Attorney-General\'s office </p><p>more time to come up with evidence and that Supreme Court </p><p>Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku, a known ruling party supporter, </p><p>the Justice Ministry Permanent Secretary and another GOZ </p><p>official were seen entering Garwe\'s chambers just before the </p><p>hearing.  End note.)  After Moyo\'s attorneys presented their </p><p>application for release, the prosecutor had no affidavit to </p><p>challenge it.  Garwe chastised the police for failing to </p><p>provide reasons for Moyo\'s detention, remarked that he found </p><p>their evidential letters "defective" (see paragraph 2), and </p><p>stated that even though the police mistakenly charged Moyo </p><p>under a nonexistent clause of the POSA, he believed he knew </p><p>which clause they meant.  Despite all these failings of the </p><p>State\'s case, Garwe found, incredibly, that Moyo\'s detention </p><p>was lawful and that the letters presented by the police were </p><p>grounds for further investigation.  Those in attendance were </p><p>so appalled that no one stood as Garwe left the courtroom. </p><p>Even the police investigators, who expected the case to be </p><p>dismissed, were aghast.  As the State presented no official </p><p>challenge, and the 48-hour limit for detention was up, Moyo </p><p>and Mapombere were free to go.  Only after the </p><p>Attorney-General contacted Moyo\'s lawyers later in the day </p><p>was an arrangement made to put Moyo and Mapombere on remand </p><p>(bail).  They both appeared in magistrate\'s court on June 6, </p><p>when they were each required to pay Z$20,000 (US$43) bail and </p><p>surrender their passports.  They will be on remand until </p><p>August 1. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Several Reasons Behind the Intimidation </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Moyo elaborated on a number of possible reasons the </p><p>GOZ has chosen to try to intimidate and harass him now, even </p><p>though the Law Society has routinely spoken out in the past </p><p>against the erosion of the rule of law in Zimbabwe: </p><p> </p><p>a) The Justice Ministry has hatched a plan to indoctrinate </p><p>all prosecutors, judges and magistrates in the history of the </p><p>anti-colonial struggle.  The plan would have Army instructors </p><p>setting up courses at the Judicial College, a heretofore </p><p>independent institution that trains mainly magistrates in </p><p>legal procedures.  As a member of the Judicial College board, </p><p>Moyo opposed this plan and said the Law Society would </p><p>consider a legal challenge to it if it went forward.  Garwe </p><p>and Chidyausiku, who are also board members, replied that </p><p>they would be willing to hold the courses outside the </p><p>Judicial College, but would insist on the indoctrination.  As </p><p>a counteroffer, Moyo proposed to have members of the Law </p><p>Society teach the courses.  Chidyausiku, who is the board </p><p>chairman, said this sounded like an American-funded "Trojan </p><p>horse" designed to frustrate the Third Chimurenga and refused </p><p>the offer. </p><p> </p><p>b) Moyo told poloff that all government ministers are under </p><p>enormous pressure from Mugabe to come up with ways to gain </p><p>control of professional workers and the organizations that </p><p>represent them, such as the LSZ.  Justice Minister Patrick </p><p>Chinamasa has repeatedly told Moyo that he wants the Law </p><p>Society\'s charter changed so that he has the power to appoint </p><p>the president, secretary and a majority of the councilors </p><p>that oversee the organization.  Currently, he appoints only </p><p>two out of the 12 councilors.  Moyo told Chinamasa that he </p><p>would resist such a move.  Shortly after Moyo said this, </p><p>Information Minister Jonathan Moyo came out with a statement </p><p>(in April) saying there was an "urgent need" to amend the </p><p>Legal Practitioners\' Act, which governs the operations of the </p><p>LSZ.  Police have also gone to local banks in an attempt to </p><p>freeze LSZ assets; the banks have thus far refused to </p><p>cooperate without a court order. </p><p> </p><p>c) Last month, the LSZ released its annual report, which was </p><p>critical of the Government\'s erosion of the rule of law, the </p><p>Constitution\'s allowance for the President to pack the </p><p>Supreme Court, and a number of Supreme Court decisions that </p><p>demonstrate that the highest court in the land can no longer </p><p>be counted on to protect Zimbabweans\' basic human rights. </p><p> </p><p>d) The GOZ wants to prevent articulate speakers from </p><p>criticizing GOZ policy in international fora.  Moyo believes </p><p>the GOZ, in part, wanted an excuse to seize his passport so </p><p>he could not travel this week to Durban, where he was to </p><p>present a paper on international press freedom to the </p><p>International Bar Association.  He was also due to go to </p><p>Montreal later this year to help vet legal officers for the </p><p>bar of the International Criminal Court.  Chinamasa has </p><p>called Moyo several times to question his patriotism over the </p><p>release of damning papers and reports.  "It is precisely </p><p>because I am a patriot that I have to speak out about what is </p><p>happening," Moyo told Chinamasa. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  We fear the arrest and detention of the LSZ leaders </p><p>is a precedent for an expanded campaign of GOZ intimidation </p><p>against Zimbabwean NGOs.  Now that the MDC has been </p><p>effectively stymied in the aftermath of the March </p><p>presidential election, the GOZ may be turning more of its </p><p>attention to outspoken civil society organizations.  Any one </p><p>of the reasons Moyo mentioned would be enough to begin </p><p>harassing Moyo, but all of them combined present the GOZ with </p><p>a compelling reason to make a greater effort to hamper LSZ </p><p>activities.  If the GOZ cannot bend Moyo to its wishes or </p><p>take control of the organization, it may attempt to close it </p><p>down altogether.  Other active NGOs that speak out against </p><p>the GOZ\'s increasingly repressive tactics, like the Legal </p><p>Resources Foundation, the Amani Trust, and Zimbabwe Lawyers </p><p>for Human Rights, are prime candidates for similar treatment. </p><p> With the judiciary under firmer GOZ control, as seen in </p><p>Garwe\'s blatantly partisan handling of the sloppily contrived </p><p>case against Moyo, we can expect the GOZ to try more of these </p><p>actions in the future.  The GOZ remains bent on cowing anyone </p><p>who dares to resist its tyrannical edicts.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
