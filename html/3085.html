<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001714 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: NI, PINT </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FORMER UNGA PRESIDENT GARBA DIES </p><p> </p><p>1.  Major General Joseph Nanven Garba (retired) died Saturday </p><p>morning, 1 June 2002, of undetermined causes.  He was 58. </p><p>Surviving him are Kate, his wife of six months (and companion </p><p>for five years before that), five daughters and one son (born </p><p>to a former wife, Evelyn).  Funeral arrangements have not yet </p><p>been announced, though family friends believe Saturday, 15 </p><p>June the most likely date.  President Obasanjo is likely to </p><p>attend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  As commander of the Brigade of Guards in 1975, Garba was </p><p>one of the "five colonels" who executed the bloodless coup </p><p>that toppled the increasingly rudderless regime of General </p><p>Yakubu Gowon.  The colonels asked the triumvirate of Murtala </p><p>Mohammed, Olusegun Obasanjo and Theophilus Danjuma to assume </p><p>power.  Murtala, Obasanjo and Danjuma pledged to transfer </p><p>power to an elected civilian government by 1979.  Garba </p><p>became Nigeria\'s Commissioner for External Affairs.  Nigeria </p><p>was increasingly active in world affairs during Garba\'s </p><p>tenure, providing support to liberation struggles in </p><p>Zimbabwe, South Africa and the remaining European colonies on </p><p>the African continent.  He left that position in 1978 to take </p><p>command of the Nigerian Defence Academy.  He was retired as a </p><p>Major General in 1980 by the elected Shagari government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  He received a Masters Degree in Public Administration </p><p>from Harvard in 1983.  When military rule returned in 1984, </p><p>Garba became Nigeria\'s Permanent Representative to the United </p><p>Nations, a position he held until 1989.  During that period, </p><p>he was also Chairman, United Nations Special Committee </p><p>Against Apartheid.  He was President of the UNGA for the </p><p>1991-92 term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  In 2000, Garba became Director-General of the Nigerian </p><p>Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), the </p><p>position he held until his death.  The NIPSS campus outside </p><p>of Jos (about three hours by road from Abuja) has become a </p><p>major center for Government of Nigeria retreats.  Garba\'s </p><p>dream was to make it a world-class seminar site, and he had </p><p>received word from President Obasanjo shortly before his </p><p>death that the NIPSS bid to host the Commonwealth Heads of </p><p>Government retreat in 2003 had prevailed over two rivals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  At a private dinner at his Abuja residence 27 May, Garba </p><p>was relaxed and expansive, holding forth on a broad range of </p><p>subjects.  Hosting the CHOGM retreat, however, was uppermost </p><p>in his mind.  He had not yet heard from Obasanjo at that time </p><p>but was confident NIPSS was the only choice.  He relished the </p><p>work that would go into planning the event and the permanent </p><p>improvements to NIPSS facilities that would result. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Born 17 July 1943 in Langtang, a rural part of Plateau </p><p>State, Garba was raised a Catholic and attended school in </p><p>Shendam.  He was dismissive of dancing and drumming in </p><p>church, voicing a preference for Gregorian Chants and the </p><p>Latin Mass.  The late Archbishop of Jos, Gabriel Ganaka, one </p><p>of Nigerian Catholicism\'s most conservative voices was a </p><p>close friend.  Though several years younger than President </p><p>Obasanjo and not one of his closest advisors, Garba was among </p><p>the President\'s friends and probably exercised some influence. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
