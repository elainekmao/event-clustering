Summary: On April 5 EconOff met Chief Rita Lori-Ogbebor, </p><p>an Itsekiri leader and a princess of the Warri Kingdom. </p><p>Chief Ogebebor is one of 6 Itsekiri leaders preparing for an </p><p>April 7 meeting with President Obasanjo and their Ijaw and </p><p>Urhobo counterparts.  They will try to resolve the </p><p>continuing ethnic problems in the Niger Delta that have </p><p>resulted in loss of life and property, and closure of </p><p>foreign oil company operations.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. On April 5, Chief Ogbebor told EconOff that the meeting </p><p>with the President is a result of her efforts to involve him </p><p>in a meaningful way to halt the hostilities in the Niger </p><p>delta region.  The main issue is land ownership, she said. </p><p>According to Ogbebor, the Olu of Warri is the traditional </p><p>guardian of the lands that comprise the 600-700 year-old </p><p>Kingdom of Warri. The Ijaws, according to Ogbebor, were "sea </p><p>nomads" who sailed along the coast from Ghana to Cameroon </p><p>fishing and selling their catch to Itsekiri women who re- </p><p>sold it in market places. Ogbebor stated that the Ijaws do </p><p>not have a homeland and no one knows from whence they </p><p>originated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Chief Ogbebor said she wants President Obasanjo to ask </p><p>the Ijaws what they want, from whence they came, and what </p><p>proof have they of their origins and attachment to Warri </p><p>land.  She stated that she plans to "remind him" of his </p><p>responsibility to ensure that all Nigerians can safely </p><p>conduct legitimate economic activity and have their rights </p><p>respected.  To this end, she is pleased with the presence of </p><p>the military forces in the Delta since they protect the </p><p>Itsekiris from Ijaw attacks.  Should the results of the </p><p>meeting with the President be unsatisfactory, Ogbebor said </p><p>she will issue a 21-day ultimatum that states that if the </p><p>President does not control the Ijaws, the Itsekiris will </p><p>have no choice but to engage in armed struggle.  In that </p><p>event, the Itsekiris\' land will no longer be a part of Delta </p><p>State since they will establish their own state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Ogbebor disclosed that there is nonetheless disagreement </p><p>within the Itsekiri camp.  She and other like-minded </p><p>activists advocate recourse to armed struggle to resolve the </p><p>conflict with the Ijaws.  But The Olu of Warri has failed to </p><p>provide firm direction and his hesitancy to authorize action </p><p>is one of the reasons, she said, why so many Itsekiris have </p><p>been slaughtered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Because continuing violence has forced large numbers of </p><p>Itsekiris to flee their homes, many of them will be unable </p><p>to vote in the upcoming elections.  Ogbebor concluded from </p><p>this that the Ijaws are attempting to control the elections </p><p>through ethnic cleansing.  She requested USG assistance </p><p>(tents, boats, food, clothing and fishing nets) to help the </p><p>displaced Itsekiris return to their homes to vote.  She </p><p>further asked that the USG help establish a Commission for </p><p>the Safety of Minority Rights.  Ogbebor has written to the </p><p>United Nations and plans to go to New York within two weeks </p><p>to seek UN intervention. She will argue, she said, that the </p><p>Ijaws are engaged in genocide against the Itsekiris. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment:  Chief Ogbebor\'s plan to have President </p><p>Obasanjo challenge the Ijaws\' right to a place in the Niger </p><p>Delta certainly won\'t advance the peace agenda.  However, </p><p>her interpretation of the Ijaw-Itsekiri conflict reflects </p><p>the fact that many of Nigeria\'s ethnic problems are rooted </p><p>in squabbles over land rights and the debate about who is </p><p>Nigerian. That said, we suspect that the real issue in this </p><p>instance is not about control of the much-polluted land and </p><p>water in the Delta region, but rather over the much bigger </p><p>question of oil wealth and who benefits from it, an issue in </p><p>which all Nigerians have equity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hinson-Jones </p><p></p></div>
