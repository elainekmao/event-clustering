<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002653 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/RA:BITTRICK </p><p>NSC FOR FRAZER AND MILLER, MCLEAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, CG, BY, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS01: NIGERIA: DANJUMA\'S CONDOLENCES, THE </p><p>MIL-MIL RELATIONSHIP AND AFRICA PKO OPERATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2562 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by DATT, </p><p>PolMilOff and DOD Colonel Terry Tidler called on Defense </p><p>Minister Danjuma October 10 (COL I.D. Pennap, Personal Staff </p><p>Officer to the Minister, also attended).  Offering his </p><p>condolences on September 11, Danjuma revealed that he had </p><p>instructed the Chief of Army Staff to update contingency </p><p>plans for Abuja.  The MOD was noncommittal whether Nigeria </p><p>would renew MPRI for 2002.  He asked the DATT to discuss </p><p>UNAMSIL rotation options with the Chief of Defense Staff. </p><p>Nigeria continued to prepare for a Congo peacekeeping </p><p>mission, and was preparing to support, but not lead, a </p><p>Burundi mission.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>MPRI - WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) During a discussion of the upcoming MPRI </p><p>In-Progress-Review (which took place on October 12 - septel), </p><p>Ambassador Jeter emphasized that MPRI was at a critical </p><p>juncture.  MPRI\'s reform assistance was clearly important to </p><p>Nigeria\'s military institutions, but could only be effective </p><p>if embraced by the MOD and Services.  The Minister agreed, </p><p>noting that he and the Service Chiefs would make their joint </p><p>recommendation to the President based on the </p><p>In-Progress-Review (IPR).  He agreed to attend a Presidential </p><p>meeting with Generals Saint and Vuono of MPRI, which we hope </p><p>to have the week of October 22. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>OFR - GOOD NEWS </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador Jeter remarked that Operation Focus Relief </p><p>Phase 3 (OFR P3) was going exceptionally well.  The Army was </p><p>providing outstanding support to the DATT and the 3rd Special </p><p>Forces Trainers.  Clearly pleased, Danjuma declined a trip to </p><p>one of the base camps for fear of helicopters, but agreed to </p><p>visit the FOB in Abuja with the Ambassador soon.  Raising the </p><p>MOI, the Ambassador told Danjuma we still awaited the pending </p><p>signature or a Nigerian response.  The MOD Legal Department </p><p>had, for some unknown reason, sent the document to the </p><p>Nigerian Defense Intelligence Agency, Jeter explained. </p><p>Danjuma, incredulous, could not understand why the Legal </p><p>Department transmitted the MOI to DIA, but stated he would </p><p>get an answer to us soon.  Danjuma stated that he had already </p><p>seen the 505 Note, and was confused why it had also not been </p><p>completed.  He directed Pennap to "chase it." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>UNAMSIL ROTATIONS </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador Jeter informally asked Danjuma if Nigeria </p><p>might consider a 6-month rotation for one of the units now </p><p>entering UNAMSIL, with the goal of getting the third OFR P3 </p><p>battalion into Sierra Leone by April.  Danjuma, not willing </p><p>to supercede planning by the Services, suggested the DATT </p><p>raise the question with the Chief of Defense Staff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>THE WORD ON DROC/BURUNDI </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Responding to the Ambassador\'s question about </p><p>peacekeeping commitments, Danjuma explained that Nigeria was </p><p>committed to send troops to Congo and had designated a unit. </p><p>However, delays in reaching a settlement in the DROC had </p><p>caused them to stand down.  Having served in the Congo in the </p><p>1960\'s, President Obasanjo felt a strong connection and was </p><p>committed to participate when a mission began. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) On Burundi, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana and one other </p><p>country (Danjuma could not remember which), had begun </p><p>discussions on a possible peacekeeping mission.  The planning </p><p>meetings, which Danjuma expected to conclude soon, would </p><p>determine the size of the contingents, and dates of possible </p><p>deployment.  Deployment might begin in the near future, but </p><p>Nigeria would be last to deploy in any rotation.  Troops from </p><p>Southern African countries should lead since Nigeria was not </p><p>sufficiently familiar with the area, Danjuma reasoned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========= </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p>========= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The meeting concluded with a brief discussion on </p><p>terrorism.  Danjuma said that unfortunately globalization and </p><p>information technology had afforded the terrorists as much </p><p>propaganda capacity as the West.  He also expressed concern </p><p>that the Al-Qa\'ida and associated organizations would stop at </p><p>nothing to drag ordinary Nigerians into the conflict. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter contended that Nigeria\'s greatest </p><p>vulnerability was its oil and natural gas facilities in the </p><p>Delta.  Actually, said Danjuma, "We worry about Abuja." </p><p>Explaining that Abuja had an open and excellent road system, </p><p>which was essentially "deserted" at night, Danjuma had tasked </p><p>Chief of Army Staff LTG Ogomudia to update Army contingency </p><p>plans for the capital. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: Recently back from a long vacation in Spain, </p><p>Danjuma appeared refreshed.  This boded well for the </p><p>MPRI/IPR, but even after good, open and frank discussions, it </p><p>remains unclear whether the Ministry and Services will </p><p>support another round of the program.  While Danjuma\'s </p><p>mentioning of Abuja as the greatest security concern in the </p><p>aftermath of September 11 seems out of step with mainstream </p><p>senior GON thinking, we are nonetheless heartened that he is </p><p>taking precautions to guard the city and, by extension, the </p><p>Embassy.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Freetown minimize considered. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
