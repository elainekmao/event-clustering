<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 003603 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR Claire Kaneshiro NEA/ARP, Duncan Macinnes NEA/PPD, </p><p>Robert Persiko ECA/PE/C/PY, CA/VO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, CVIS, SCUL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY ADDRESSES CONCERNS ON STUDENT VISAS, NSEERS </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: Security concerns in Kuwait this year </p><p>   disrupted traditional preparations to study in the United </p><p>   States. As a counterbalance, PAS and the Consular Section </p><p>   have collaborated on several public affairs initiatives </p><p>   designed to facilitate study in the U.S.  Our Consul has </p><p>   appeared on local television programs, did a call-in program </p><p>   interview with a leading local newspaper, and met with the </p><p>   Kuwait Student\'s Union to discuss National Security Entry- </p><p>   Exit Registration System (NSEERS) requirements, among other </p><p>   topics.  The Embassy increased student visa content on its </p><p>   website. The Consular Section hosted two `Student Visa Days\' </p><p>   during which students were able to apply for visas without </p><p>   appointments. The Consular Section also ensured timely </p><p>   issuance of visas for Kuwaiti high school students </p><p>   participating in an important public diplomacy initiative, </p><p>   the Youth Exchange and Study (YES) Program. Student visa </p><p>   issuances are up about 20% compared this summer compared to </p><p>   last, thanks also to faster turn around on SAO requests. END </p><p>   SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Security concerns in Kuwait this year disrupted </p><p>   traditional preparations to study in the United States. </p><p>   Many U.S. academic institutions cancelled recruitment trips </p><p>   to Kuwait beginning last fall due to fears of terrorism and </p><p>   war. The Ministry of Education closed schools in Kuwait for </p><p>   almost a month during Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The closure </p><p>   caused many students substantial delays in gaining </p><p>   admissions to U.S. institutions for the fall semester. The </p><p>   extension of the academic year to make up for class time </p><p>   lost during the war also delayed allocation of government </p><p>   scholarships upon which many Kuwaiti students depend for </p><p>   overseas study. </p><p> </p><p>3.   PAS and the Consular Section have in the past three </p><p>   months collaborated on a number of initiatives to </p><p>   counterbalance these factors and facilitate study in the </p><p>   United States.  The strategy has been to ensure students </p><p>   could apply with adequate time to complete required </p><p>   clearance procedures before their school start date, while </p><p>   also disseminating information on student visa applications </p><p>   and National Security Entry-Exit Registration System </p><p>   (NSEERS) requirements through speaking appearances by the </p><p>   Consul and through the local media. </p><p> </p><p>4.   On May 27 and June 20, Consul Sean Murphy appeared on </p><p>   Arabic and English television, respectively, to answer </p><p>   questions from the public on visa-related issues.  The </p><p>   Arabic venue, a morning talk-show carried locally and on </p><p>   Kuwait\'s satellite channel, is one of the Gulf\'s most </p><p>   popular programs. The format was questions from an </p><p>   interviewer interspersed with calls from the public. The </p><p>   station allowed the segment with the Consul to run twice its </p><p>   allotted time due to the volume of calls, most of which </p><p>   focused on visa application requirements and NSEERS.  The </p><p>   appearance on Kuwait\'s English-language channel followed a </p><p>   similar format and likewise received a large number of calls </p><p>   on these topics. </p><p> </p><p>5.   On July 20, Consul Murphy and APAO Kevin Olbrysh </p><p>   visited the offices of leading Arabic daily newspaper Al- </p><p>   Qabas to address directly the concerns of its readers. Phone- </p><p>   in questions ranged over individual visa cases and concerns </p><p>   regarding NSEERS reentry procedures. Between calls the </p><p>   editor of the local section asked follow-up and more general </p><p>   questions.  The local section editor asked about security </p><p>   procedures and specifically about future plans to capture </p><p>   biometric data from NIV applicants, as well as the scale of </p><p>   illegal immigration to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Al-Qabas the following day published a half-page </p><p>   interior spread covering the session, with a lead-in below </p><p>   the fold on the front page. The first paragraph of the story </p><p>   noted that the capture of biometric data would apply to </p><p>   "Kuwaitis and all individuals from around the world applying </p><p>   for US visas." The coverage positively emphasized the need </p><p>   for security in the U.S. visa process by setting it in the </p><p>   context of illegal immigration and legitimate concerns about </p><p>   terrorism, and noted that Arabs and Kuwaitis are not being </p><p>   singled out. </p><p> </p><p>7.   On July 22, the Consul fielded questions at a "freshman </p><p>   orientation" session for around 80 Kuwaiti students who will </p><p>   be departing for studies in the U.S. in the fall. The </p><p>   session was sponsored by the U.S. chapter of the National </p><p>   Union of Kuwait Students (NUKS), and attendees also included </p><p>   a representative from the Ministry of Higher Education and </p><p>   two student union speakers. The Consul met with NUKS board </p><p>   members prior to the session  to discuss concerns about </p><p>   returning students who may not have complied with NSEERS </p><p>   departure requirements. </p><p> </p><p>8.   The Consular Section held "open" days for student visa </p><p>   applicants on July 14 and 28, on which applicants for </p><p>   student visas could appear for interviews without an </p><p>   appointment. These dates were announced via press release </p><p>   well in advance and the Government of Kuwait was informed </p><p>   via diplomatic note.  A total of 214 students and their </p><p>   dependents applied for visas on those two days.  Overall, </p><p>   issuance of student visas for June-July 2003 is up about 20% </p><p>   compared to the same period last year, thanks also to faster </p><p>   turn-around on SAO requests. </p><p> </p><p>9.   Coinciding with the first Student Visa Day, the Embassy </p><p>   launched a new link on its webpage, "Information for </p><p>   Students".  The link collects in one place information </p><p>   previously available elsewhere on the site and adds </p><p>   additional content of interest to students.  It includes </p><p>   NSEERS requirements in English and Arabic.  The NSEERS </p><p>   information has been given in writing to all applicants </p><p>   known to be subject to the program since its inception. </p><p> </p><p>10.  PAS and the Consular Section also worked closely to </p><p>   accommodate early visa interview appointments for seven high </p><p>   school students from Kuwait that will live and study in the </p><p>   US during the 2003-04 academic year under the State </p><p>   Department funded Partnerships for Learning (P4L) Youth </p><p>   Exchange and Study (YES) Program. All students received </p><p>   their visas well before their scheduled departure date later </p><p>   this month. To help publicize the program PAS arranged media </p><p>   coverage for a farewell reception in honor of the students </p><p>   and their parents hosted by the Ambassador and attended by </p><p>   the Minister of Education. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT.  We would like to think we have turned </p><p>   something of a corner on student visas.  In addition, the </p><p>   increase in stability in the region will permit U.S. </p><p>   colleges and universities to again schedule recruiting trips </p><p>   to Kuwait and allow Kuwaiti students to make plans without </p><p>   the disruptions caused this year by the War.  We will </p><p>   continue our efforts to encourage study in the United States </p><p>   and to ensure that students are aware of their </p><p>   responsibilities under NSEERS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
