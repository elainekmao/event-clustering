(U) An editorial published on March 3 by a well-regarded </p><p>economic commentator lauded the recent Ministry of Labour draft </p><p>proposal to formally establish labor unions (reftel).  Salah Al </p><p>Halyan, managing director of Gulf Insurance Consulting and an </p><p>editorial columnist for the Gulf News, wrote that "unions will </p><p>soon exist in this part of the world; a great move which will </p><p>provide for improved work conditions and protection of workers\' </p><p>rights leading to higher work standards.  The winds of change are </p><p>certainly blowing in our direction, for the benefit of all." </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment: Al Halyan\'s comments are indicative of the </p><p>positive reception the draft proposals have received. While </p><p>workers already enjoy considerable informal rights to organize </p><p>and request redress of grievances  (strikes, though infrequent, </p><p>are not uncommon here), regulations to formerly recognize these </p><p>rights present further progress towards the establishment in the </p><p>UAE of a fully modern economy, as desired by both business and </p><p>government leaders here. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
