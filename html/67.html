<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 08 RIYADH 05470 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KPRP, PREL, MOPS, ENRG, IR, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI POLICY TOWARD IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  84 RIYADH 7002 </p><p> </p><p>1.  S - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  EVENTS AND PASSAGE OF TIME HAVE COM- </p><p>BINED TO MITIGATE SAUDI FEARS AND HOPES REGARDING </p><p>IRAN.  MORE CONFIDENT NOW THAT IRAQ WILL NOT BE </p><p>DEFEATED, THAT THERE IS LESS DANGER OF A DIRECT </p><p>IRANIAN ATTACK ON SAUDI ARABIA, THAT THE LIKELI- </p><p>HOOD OF EFFECTIVE IRANIAN-INSPIRED SUBVERSION IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA IS NOW SMALL, AND THAT THE DANGER OF </p><p>SUBVERSION IN OTHER GULF COUNTRIES IS PROBABLY </p><p>CONTAINABLE, THE SAG HAS GROWN COMFORTABLE WITH </p><p>THE IRAQI STRATEGY OF ATTEMPTING TO FORCE IRAN </p><p>TOWARD THE NEGOTIATING TABLE THROUGH MILITARY, </p><p>ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE THAT, OVER TIME, </p><p>MAY CONVINCE THE IRANIANS THAT THEY HAVE NO </p><p>ALTERNATIVE.  THE SAG DISTRUSTS IRAN AS MUCH AS </p><p>THE IRAQIS DO AND DOES NOT BEAR THE DIRECT BURDEN </p><p>OF CONTAINING ITS REVOLUTION; THUS SAUDI PATIENCE </p><p>IS IN FACT GREATER THAN THAT OF IRAQ.  THE SAG FULLY </p><p>ACCEPTS IRAQ\'S ANALYSES OF THE WAR AND THE SITUATION </p><p>IN IRAN AND IS GIVING IRAQ FULL DIPLOMATIC BACKING, </p><p>INCLUDING IN ITS RECENT CONTACTS WITH IRAN.  THE </p><p>MESSAGE THE SAG IS SENDING IRAN IS THAT THE </p><p>SAUDIS CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM IRAQ WHILE THE </p><p>CONFLICT LASTS, BUT THAT THEY WISH TO REMAIN IN </p><p>CONTACT WITH IRAN AND HOPE FOR A COOPERATIVE RELA- </p><p>TIONSHIP ONCE IRAN CEASES TO PURSUE ITS GOALS </p><p>ABROAD BY MILITARY MEANS.  THE CHIEF SAG POLICY- </p><p>MAKERS, IN THIS AS IN OTHER FIELDS, ARE PROBABLY </p><p>FAHD, ABDULLAH, SULTAN, AND NAIF, AND THERE DO NOT </p><p>APPEAR TO BE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THEM.  THEY </p><p>RECOGNIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL, THEOLOGICAL HOSTILITY </p><p>OF THE IRANIAN REGIME AND UNDERSTAND THAT UNTIL THE </p><p>REVOLUTION HAS BEEN BLUNTED AND ITS NATURE SIGNIFI- </p><p>CANTLY TRANSFORMED, IT WILL REPRESENT A THREAT TO </p><p>THE AL SAUD.  THEY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO BE FIRM </p><p>IN DEFENSE OF WHAT IS THEIRS, LEST IRAN ESCALATE </p><p>ITS THREATS, AS SHOWN IN LAST SUMMER\'S SHOOTDOWN </p><p>OF AT LEAST ONE IRANIAN AIRCRAFT AND SUBSEQUENT </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF RSAF RULES OF ENGAGEMENT.  THEY </p><p>HAVE NOT ABANDONED THEIR  TRADITIONAL CAUTION, </p><p>HOWEVER, AND CONTINUE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY </p><p>INTEND NO AGGRESSIVE THREAT TO IRAN, AS SHOWN IN </p><p>THEIR CONCILIATORY STANCE AFTER THE AIRCRAFT </p><p>SHOOTDOWN.  THEY ARE ACUTELY AWARE, TOO, OF THE </p><p>LONG-TERM NEED FOR A DECENT WORKING RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH IRAN, AND HOPE THAT OVER TIME THE REVOLUTION </p><p>WILL MODERATE AND SHARED INTERESTS WILL ASSERT </p><p>THEMSELVES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  A NUMBER OF FACTORS HAVE SHIFTED, EITHER WITH </p><p>EVENTS OR THE MERE PASSAGE OF TIME, SINCE OUR LAST </p><p>OVERALL LOOK AT SAUDI-IRANIAN RELATIONS (REFTEL). </p><p>THE NET RESULT HAS BEEN INCREASED SAUDI CONFIDENCE </p><p>AND LESS SHARP SAUDI SWINGS BETWEEN FEARS AND HOPES. </p><p>PRINCIPAL CHANGES INCLUDE:  (A) CONTINUING CON- </p><p>FIRMATION OF IRAQI ABILITY TO HOLD THE IRANIANS ON </p><p>THE GROUND; (B) THE GROWING RELATIVE STRENGTH OF </p><p>THE IRAQI AIR FORCE AND NAVY; (C) THE "SANCTIFYING" </p><p>OF A BROAD RSAF AIR DEFENSE ZONE IMPLICIT IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF IRANIAN ATTACKS IN THE NORTHERN GULF </p><p>SINCE THE SAUDI SHOOTDOWN LAST JUNE OF AN IRANIAN </p><p>F-4 OR TWO (THOUGH IRAN MAY BE MOUNTING A NEW TEST </p><p>ON THIS FRONT); (D) DEVELOPMENT OF SOME SKEPTICISM </p><p>ABOUT ALLEGED "FAVORABLE TRENDS" IN IRAN, FOLLOWING </p><p>GREATER EXPERIENCE WITH IRANIAN PLOYS DESIGNED TO </p><p>DISTANCE GCC COUNTRIES FROM IRAQ OR TO GAIN GREATER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT OR SYMPATHY BY APPEARING </p><p>"REASONABLE" ON SUCH HUMANITARIAN QUESTIONS AS </p><p>BOMBING CITIES (WHILE REFUSING TO DISCUSS A GENERAL </p><p>SETTLEMENT); (E) THE DULLING OF THE ALLURE OF </p><p>IRAN\'S REVOLUTION AS THE STALEMATE CONTINUES AND </p><p>APPEARS INCREASINGLY UNFAVORABLE TO IRAN; (F) </p><p>THE APPOINTMENT OF A DYNAMIC NEW RULING-FAMILY </p><p>GOVERNOR IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE; (G) THE APPARENT </p><p>FIRMING OF KUWAITI RESOLVE (BUT INCREASED CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT THE UAE AND, PERHAPS, OMAN); AND (H) THE CHANGING </p><p>FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP AS COMPLETION OF IRAQ\'S MAJOR </p><p>NEW/EXPANDED PIPELINES NEARS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>FEARS AND HOPES </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  IT HAS NOT BEEN LONG SINCE A LITTLE BAD NEWS-- </p><p>AN IRANIAN OFFENSIVE OR A FEW IRANIAN OR IRAQI </p><p>ATTACKS ON SHIPPING--WOULD SEND THE SAG INTO A </p><p>MOMENTARY NEAR-PANIC, IN WHICH IT WOULD RAISE SUCH </p><p>QUESTIONS AS WHAT "MILITARY MOVES" THE USG MIGHT </p><p>MAKE TO HELP ASSURE SECURITY IN THE GULF.  THIS </p><p>IS NO LONGER TRUE.  THE SAUDIS, REPORTEDLY ALONG </p><p>WITH OTHER GCC OFFICIALS ATTENDING THE MARCH 1985 </p><p>GCC MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE, CERTAINLY EXPERIENCED </p><p>UNEASY MOMENTS DURING THE RECENT IRANIAN OFFENSIVE </p><p>IN THE HAWAIZAH MARSHES, AND HAD THE IRAQIS BROKEN, </p><p>WOULD HAVE SEEN THEMSELVES BACK IN THE BAD OLD </p><p>DAYS OF 1982-83, WITH THEIR WORST FEARS ALL BUT </p><p>REALIZED.  AS THE IRAQIS DID NOT BREAK, HOWEVER, </p><p>SUCH FEARS HAVE RECEDED AND THE BASIS FOR SAUDI </p><p>CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN REAFFIRMED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE SAUDIS\' "WORST FEARS," OF COURSE, ENTAIL </p><p>A VISION OF A TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTIONARY IRAN LOOMING </p><p>MENACINGLY OVER KUWAIT AND OVER SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>ITSELF.  ITS OTHER FEARS INCLUDE A DIRECT IRANIAN </p><p>ATTACK OF SOME SORT, AN ESCALATION THAT WOULD </p><p>DRAW SAUDI ARABIA OR SMALLER GULF COUNTRIES INTO </p><p>THE WAR, IRANIAN-DIRECTED SUBVERSION AGAINST </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA, AND IRANIAN-DIRECTED SUBVERSION </p><p>AGAINST ONE OR MORE OF THE SMALLER GULF STATES. </p><p>ALL OF THESE FEARS HAVE DIMINISHED, WITH THE </p><p>PARTIAL EXCEPTION OF FEARS ABOUT SUBVERSION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE RISK OF ESCALATION, TOO, HAS GROWN LESS </p><p>FEARSOME.  IRAN HAS RESPECTED THE SAUDI-DECLARED </p><p>AIR DEFENSE ZONES SINCE SAUDI F-15\'S SHOOT DOWN </p><p>AN IRANIAN F-4 LAST JUNE.  THIS FACT HAS EASED </p><p>SAUDI FEARS AND INCREASED SAUDI CONFIDENCE IN </p><p>THEIR ABILITY TO DETER DIRECT IRANIAN ATTACKS. </p><p>THIS REMAINS TRUE DESPITE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS OF THE SOMEWHAT MYSTERIOUS JUNE 1 </p><p>ATTACK ON THE CONTAINER VESSEL "ORIENTAL IMPORTER" </p><p>IN THE NORTHERN GULF, AND SPECULATION IN INDUSTRY </p><p>CIRCLES THAT IF THE ATTACK REPRESENTS A NEW </p><p>TURN IN IRANIAN TACTICS, IT MAY BRING A NEW </p><p>CONFRONTATION BETWEEN IRANIAN AIRCRAFT AND THE RSAF. </p><p>THE SAUDIS HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS UPS AND DOWNS IN THE </p><p>TANKER WAR, AND HAVE SEEN THE TANKER WAR ATTACKS </p><p>SETTLE INTO A PATTERN OF IRAQI ATTACKS SOUTH OF </p><p>KHARG AND IRANIAN REPRISALS EAST OF QATAR, OUTSIDE </p><p>THE ZONE COVERED BY RSAF CAPS.  IN THESE ZONES </p><p>ATTACK FREQUENCY MAY WAX AND WANE, BUT THE SAG NO </p><p>LONGER GREATLY FEARS THAT THESE ATTACKS WILL </p><p>ESCALATE OR SPREAD THE CONFLICT. IT HAS ALSO SEEN </p><p>THAT THE EFFECTS ON AVAILABILITY OF VESSELS IN THE </p><p>GULF AND ON INSURANCE RATES ARE FAR LESS DRASTIC </p><p>THAN PREVIOUSLY FEARED.  THE SAG WAS ANNOYED AND </p><p>PUZZLED BY IRAQI ATTACKS IN MARCH IN THE VICINITY </p><p>OF RAS TANURA LIGHT, BUT APPARENTLY TOOK THIS UP </p><p>WITH BAGHDAD AND WAS SATISFIED WITH THE RESPONSE. </p><p>IF IRAN DOES MOUNT FURTHER ATTACKS IN THE AREA OF </p><p>THE ATTACK ON THE "ORIENTAL IMPORTER," WE BELIEVE </p><p>THE RSAF WOULD AGAIN ATTEMPT TO RESPOND, AND THAT </p><p>A SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE WOULD PROBABLY BRING A HALT </p><p>IN THE NEW IRANIAN ATTACKS.  IF THE RSAF SHOULD </p><p>INITIALLY FAIL, OF COURSE, THE GULF COULD SEE SOME </p><p>TENSE DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IRANIAN-DIRECTED OR INSPIRED SUBVERSION AGAINST </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA, WHILE IT REPRESENTS A POSSIBILITY THAT </p><p>WILL NEVER BE TREATED LIGHTLY HERE, NEVERTHELESS </p><p>NO LONGER AMOUNTS TO A BUGABOO, THOUGHTS OF WHICH </p><p>AWAKEN SAUDI LEADERS AT NIGHT.  THE FIRM, NOT </p><p>TO SAY BRUTAL, HANDLING OF THE 1979 DISTURBANCES </p><p>IN QATIF AND AL-HASA, CONTINUING CLOSE SURVEILLANCE </p><p>OF THE SHI\'A, CLEAR WARNINGS OF THE REACTION THAT </p><p>MAY BE ANTICIPATED TO FUTURE DISTURBANCES, SOME- </p><p>TIME TRAVEL CONTROLS ON SHI\'A, AND OCCASIONAL </p><p>ARRESTS ALL GIVE SAUDI AUTHORITIES CONFIDENCE </p><p>THAT THEY HAVE THE SITUATION WELL IN HAND.  THE </p><p>STICK BEING HIGHLY VISIBLE, THE SAG HAS BROUGHT </p><p>FORTH A FEW CARROTS OF LATE, DEVOTING SOME </p><p>RESOURCES TO IMPROVING THE LOT OF THE EASTERN </p><p>PROVINCE SHI\'A.  IT APPEARS LIKELY THAT NEW </p><p>EASTERN PROVINCE AMIR MUHAMMAD IBN FAHD, HAVING </p><p>MADE AN EARLY AND FAVORABLY RECEIVED OPENING </p><p>TO THE SHI\'A, WILL ATTEMPT TO COME UP WITH MORE </p><p>CARROTS.  NEITHER STICKS NOR CARROTS HAVE </p><p>GREAT MEANING, OF COURSE, TO SHI\'A IN LOVE WITH </p><p>MARTYRDOM, BUT EVIDENCE IS LACKING THAT MORE THAN </p><p>A FEW IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE SHARE THIS DEGREE </p><p>OF FANATICISM WITH THEIR IRANIAN CO-RELIGIONISTS. </p><p>THE SAG SUSPECTS, OF COURSE, A DIRECT OR INDIRECT </p><p>IRANIAN HAND IN THE TWO RECENT EXPLOSIONS IN </p><p>RIYADH, AND IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF </p><p>SUCH INCIDENTS ON THE SENSE OF  SECURITY THAT IS </p><p>CONSIDERED, BY SAUDIS AND EXPATRIATES ALIKE, A </p><p>MAJOR BENEFIT OF (OR COMPENSATION FOR) LIFE IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p>- </p><p>8.  THE ANNUAL HAJJ OF COURSE PROVIDES THE OTHER </p><p>SOURCE OF SAUDI ANXIETY ABOUT IRANIAN TROUBLEMAKING. </p><p>THE SAUDIS GAINED MUCH CONFIDENCE LAST YEAR WHEN </p><p>THEY HANDLED 150,000 IRANIAN PILGRIMS WITH CON- </p><p>SIDERABLE SUCCESS.  THE SINGLE MAJOR INCIDENT, </p><p>A FRACAS BETWEEN IRANIAN AND IRAQI PILGRIMS, WAS </p><p>HANDLED WITH DESPATCH, AND THE SAUDIS FIRMLY </p><p>REJECTED IRAN\'S PROTEST AND OFFERED THEIR OWN </p><p>PUBLIC ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS.  NEVERTHELESS, HAJJ </p><p>SECURITY DEEPLY CONCERNS THE SAG, AND IT IS MAKING </p><p>PREPARATIONS TO HANDLE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE </p><p>ANTICIPATED.  NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE SIZE OF THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S IRANIAN HAJJ INFLUX HAVE, ACCORDING TO SIRO, </p><p>BEEN CONCLUDED, AND THE NUMBER OF IRANIAN PILGRIMS </p><p>AGAIN SET AT 150,000.  SAUDI SECURITY OFFICIALS </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY URGED THAT THE NUMBERS BE KEPT DOWN. </p><p>THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP MAY HAVE DECIDED TO SEEK, </p><p>THROUGH AGREEING TO RECEIVE A LARGER NUMBER, </p><p>IMPLICITLY TO PUT THE LIE TO IRANIAN CHARGES </p><p>THAT THE AL SAUD ARE UNWORTHY CUSTODIANS OF THE </p><p>HOLY CITIES.  WERE A PROMINENT CLERIC TO AGREE </p><p>TO HEAD THE OFFICIAL IRANIAN DELEGATION, THAT </p><p>MESSAGE WOULD BE UNDERSCORED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE POSSIBILITY OF IRANIAN SHENANIGANS IN THE </p><p>SMALL STATES OF THE GULF CONTINUES TO HAUNT THE </p><p>SAUDI OFFICIAL PSYCHE.  THERE WAS GREAT CONCERN </p><p>HERE, OF COURSE, ABOUT THE BAHRAIN PLOT DISCOVERED </p><p>IN DECEMBER OF 1982, AND ALSO ABOUT THE PLOT IN </p><p>QATAR IN THE SUMMER OF 1983 (THOUGH THERE WERE </p><p>SUGGESTIONS, AS WE RECALL, THAT THAT MAY HAVE </p><p>INVOLVED LIBYAN ADVENTURISM).  CONTINUING CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT THE STEADFASTNESS OF THE KUWAITI AUTHORITIES </p><p>HAS BEEN ASSUAGED SOMEWHAT BY KUWAIT\'S RESPONSE </p><p>TO THE DECEMBER 1983 BOMBINGS AND THE HIJACKING </p><p>LATE LAST YEAR, AND BY WHAT IS PERCEIVED HERE AS </p><p>KUWAIT\'S GENERALLY FIRMER SECURITY POLICY, </p><p>INCLUDING ITS INCREASED INTEREST IN GCC MILITARY </p><p>COOPERATION.  (SIRO NOTES THAT THE SAG ADVISED </p><p>THE GOK EITHER TO EXECUTE THE PRISONERS IT HELD </p><p>IN CONNECTION WITH THE DECEMBER 1983 BOMBINGS OR </p><p>TO LET THEM GO, TO AVOID FUTURE PROBLEMS.) </p><p>IRAN IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE IMPLICATED, </p><p>DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE RECENT ATTEMPT ON </p><p>THE LIFE OF THE AMIR OF KUWAIT.  THE SAG LEADERSHIP </p><p>SEEMED SHOCKED BY THIS ATTEMPT, GUT IN RETROSPECT </p><p>APPEARS RELIEVED THAT THE SHOCK ADMINISTERED TO </p><p>KUWAIT\'S BODY POLITIC IS PROVING A SALUTARY ONE, </p><p>FURTHER FIRING KUWAITI DETERMINATION TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>ITS SECURITY.  THE SAG APPEARS SOMEWHAT CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT THE POLITICAL DRIFT IN THE UAE AND THE </p><p>INCREASED IRANIAN ACTIVITY THERE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  SAUDI HOPES CONCERNING POSSIBLE POSITIVE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAN, NEVER GREAT, ARE NOW VERY </p><p>MODEST INDEED.  THE SAUDIS HAVE EXPERIENCED </p><p>OCCASIONAL SURGES OF HOPE ABOUT APPEARANCES OF </p><p>RELATIVE MODERATION AND REASONABLENESS IN IRAN, </p><p>AND THE NEED TO NURTURE ANY SEEDS OF SUCH MODERA- </p><p>TION.  THIS OCCURRED, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER LAVASANI\'S </p><p>VISIT LAST SUMMER.  BUT THESE HOPES HAVE TURNED </p><p>TO DUST.  THE SAUDIS SAW IRAN APPEAR TO STIMULATE </p><p>A GCC INITIATIVE LAST SUMMER AND THEN HOLD BACK. </p><p>THEY ALSO SAW JAPAN STIMULATED BY IRANIAN OFFICIALS </p><p>TO TAKE A SPECIFIC INITIATIVE WHICH IRAN THEN </p><p>REBUFFED.  THE IRAQIS PREDICTED THIS FAILURE.  THE </p><p>SAUDIS FIRST BELIEVED THE IRAQI ANALYSIS AND THEN </p><p>SAW IT CONFIRMED.  IT IS NOT THAT THE SAUDIS SEE NO </p><p>SIGNS OF MODERATION IN IRAN, BUT RATHER THAT THEY </p><p>NOW SHARE THE IRAQI ANALYSIS THAT THAT MODERATION </p><p>CAN ONLY EXPAND UNDER PRESSURE, MILITARY AND </p><p>DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE THAT OVER TIME MAY CONVINCE </p><p>THE IMMODERATE MAJORITY OF IRANIAN LEADERS THAT </p><p>THEIR INTRANSIGENCE IS LEADING ONLY TO INCREASING </p><p>FAILURE:  PRESSURE, IN OTHER WORDS, THAT IN TIME </p><p>MAY PROVE THE MODERATES CORRECT.  FURTHERMORE, </p><p>THE SAUDIS UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A VERY LONG ROAD </p><p>INDEED FROM IRAN\'S PRESENT FUNDAMENTAL, THEOLOGICAL </p><p>HOSTILITY TO THE AL SAUD REGIME TO A DEGREE OF </p><p>MODERATION THAT WOULD MAKE IRAN A TOLERABLY SAFE </p><p>NEIGHBOR.  THUS, THEY SUFFER LITTLE TEMPTATION </p><p>TO GRASP AT STRAWS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE SAG, WE BELIEVE, NOW SHARES ALL BUT TOTALLY </p><p>THE IRAQI ANALYSIS OF THE IRANIAN SITUATION AND OF </p><p>THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT SITUATION FOR BOTH IRAQI </p><p>AND SAUDI POLICY.  WE DETECT NO DAYLIGHT, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, BETWEEN SAUD\'S LINE ON THE WAR AND THAT </p><p>OF TARIQ AZIZ.  THE FORMER HAS IN RECENT MONTHS </p><p>PRESSED FOR CONTINUED AND INCREASED U.S. EFFORTS </p><p>TO STANCH ARMS FLOW TO IRAN AND HAS MADE SUCH </p><p>EFFORTS HIMSELF.  HE HAS ALSO BRUSHED ASIDE </p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN ABOUT ESCALATION ARISING </p><p>FROM THE SHIPPING WAR, ARGUING THAT THE IRAQIS </p><p>MUST KEEP UP THE PRESSURE ON IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>PATIENCE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  WITH THIS LOWERING OF HOPES AND FEARS, SAUDI </p><p>POLICY TOWARD IRAN IS CHARACTERIZED BY GREATER </p><p>PATIENCE.  THE IRAQIS HAVE CONVINCED THE SAG THAT </p><p>PATIENT APPLICATION OF PRESSURE IS THE ONLY WAY </p><p>TO END THE WAR.  IN THIS SITUATION, WITH THE IRAQIS </p><p>BEARING THE DIRECT BURDEN, SAUDI PATIENCE--A </p><p>DOMINANT CHARACTER TRAIT FROM EARLY TIMES--HAS </p><p>COME TO THE FORE.  THE SAG DOES NOT SEE THE WAR </p><p>AS RISK-FREE, OF COURSE, AND WOULD PREFER TO SEE </p><p>IT EDGE TOWARD NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT.  EVEN A </p><p>SMALL POSSIBILITY OF CONFLAGRATION, AFTER ALL, </p><p>DISCOMFITS SAUDIS INTENSELY.  STILL, AS THE THREAT </p><p>APPEARS TO BE CONTAINED AND TO BE LOSING FORCE, THE </p><p>SAUDIS CAN RAISE THEIR HEADS AND SEE THAT ALL IS </p><p>NOT GRIM.  A SOLUTION IS ESSENTIAL, BUT THE SAG </p><p>IS NOT EAGER, FOR EXAMPLE, TO SEE AN EARLY RETURN </p><p>OF LARGE VOLUMES OF IRANIAN AND IRAQI OIL TO THE </p><p>WORLD MARKET.  WE BELIEVE THE SAUDIS SEE GRADUAL </p><p>MOVEMENT TOWARD PEACE AS PREFERABLE TO AN EARLY </p><p>FRAGILE SETTLEMEN1 OR TO CONFLICT CONTINUED AT THE </p><p>CURRENT LEVEL.  AN IRAQ FREE OF THE WAR WITH IRAN, </p><p>FURTHERMORE, COULD REPRESENT A GREATER THREAT TO </p><p>THE SAUDIS AND THEIR GCC BRETHREN.  HOWEVER, WE </p><p>BELIEVE THE SAG WOULD CONCUR IN EMBASSY BAGHDAD\'S </p><p>INSIGHT THAT IRAQ IS NOT LIKELY TO SEEK TO ASSERT </p><p>INFLUENCE THROUGH A RETURN TO SUBVERSION OR </p><p>TERRORISM, SINCE IRAN WOULD BE THE MORE LIKELY </p><p>BENEFICIARY OF INSTABILITY IN THE GULF STATES. </p><p> </p><p>--- </p><p>OIL </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>13.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>SAUDI OIL POLICY IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY </p><p>CONCERN FOR ITS RELATIONS WITH IRAN, NOR THAT </p><p>SAUDI-IRANIAN RELATIONS IN THE ENERGY FIELD ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY A VITAL OR MAJOR COMPONENT OF OVERALL </p><p>RELATIONS.  WHILE THE PRICE OF OIL USED TO BE </p><p>(OR AT LEAST APPEAR TO BE) A BONE OF CONTENTION </p><p>BETWEEN SAUDIS AND IRANIANS, BOTH BEFORE AND </p><p>AFTER THE REVOLUTION, THIS IS NOW A MINOR THEME. </p><p>SAUDI ACCEPTANCE OF MOST OF THE BURDEN OF THE </p><p>CURRENT SLACK MARKET APPEARS TO HAVE EARNED A </p><p>MEASURE OF GRUDGING IRANIAN APPRECIATION, DESPITE </p><p>OCCASIONAL IRANIAN GRUMBLING ABOUT LOWER PRICES </p><p>AND ABOUT SAUDI RELUCTANCE TO CARRY THE WHOLE </p><p>BURDEN.  THE SAUDIS, HOWEVER, FOLLOW THIS </p><p>POLICY NOT TO EARN IRANIAN KUDOS, BUT BECAUSE </p><p>THEY PERCEIVE IT AS THE LEAST DAMAGING IN TERMS </p><p>OF THEIR OWN CONCERNS ABOUT SHORT- AND LONG-TERM </p><p>REVENUES AND ABOUT THE PRESERVATION OF OPEC.  IT IS </p><p>A MEASURE OF THE LOW PROFILE OF OIL POLICY IN </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS THAT DURING HIS MAY 8 VISIT TO </p><p>RIYADH, IRANIAN MINISTER FOR OIL AND OLYMPICS </p><p>GHAFURI-FARD MET WITH FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD AND </p><p>WITH DEFENSE MINISTER SULTAN, BUT DID NOT MEET WITH </p><p>YAMANI.  IRAN IS DOUBTLESS ANGERED AND FRUSTRATED </p><p>BY SAUDI ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ IN THE FORM OF OIL </p><p>EXPORTED ON IRAQI ACCOUNT AND PERMISSION TO BUILD </p><p>AN OIL PIPELINE CONNECTING IRAQ\'S SOUTHERN FIELDS </p><p>TO THE SAUDI EAST-WEST PIPELINE, WHICH MAY IN </p><p>TIME CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHER WEAKENING OF THE MARKET. </p><p>HOWEVER, GIVEN IRAN\'S FUNDAMENTAL HOSTILITY TO THE </p><p>SAUDI MONARCHY, IRANIAN IRRITATION IN THIS RESPECT </p><p>IS A MARGINAL CONSIDERATION THAT APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>HAD LITTLE VISIBLE EFFECT ON EITHER SAUDI OR </p><p>IRANIAN ACTIONS.  IN SUM, SAUDI OIL POLICY IS </p><p>NOT DICTATED BY CONCERN ABOUT EARNING THE GRATITUDE </p><p>OR THE HOSTILITY OF IRAN, BUT RATHER BY CONSIDERA- </p><p>TIONS INVOLVING THE WELFARE OF SAUDI ARABIA AND </p><p>OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN WHICH </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA HAS INVESTED HEAVILY, AND BY THE </p><p>PERCEIVED NECESSITY OF AIDING IRAQ.  FURTHERMORE, </p><p>THE SAG FULLY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE BASIC HOSTILITY </p><p>OF THE CURRENT IRANIAN REGIME HAS ROOTS DEEPER </p><p>THAN PASSING CONSIDERATIONS OF OIL POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>POLICY </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE PRESCRIPTION THAT THE SAUDIS SEE IN ALL </p><p>THIS FOR SAG POLICY TOWARD IRAN IS NOT ONE OF </p><p>ACTIVISM.  THE MESSAGE THEY WISH TO SEND TO IRAN </p><p>IS THAT THEY (AND OTHER GCC STATES) CANNOT BE </p><p>SEPARATED FROM IRAQ WHILE THE WAR LASTS, BUT THAT </p><p>THEY ARE ALWAYS READY TO TALK AND WILL BE READY </p><p>TO IMPROVE RELATIONS AFTER THE WAR ENDS.  THE </p><p>SAUDIS HAVE A SMALL EMBASSY IN TEHRAN--THREE TO </p><p>FOUR OFFICERS AND THEIR WELL-REGARDED CHARGE, </p><p>MARWAN AL-ROUMI.  IRAN HAS ITS SMALL EMBASSY--A </p><p>CHARGE AND THREE OFFICERS, CLOSELY WATCHED--IN </p><p>JEDDAH.  SIRO REPORTS THAT IRAN HAS NOW OBTAINED </p><p>AN EMBASSY BUILDING IN RIYADH, WHERE IT HAS STATIONED </p><p>AT LEAST ONE PERSON SO FAR.  HIGH-LEVEL IRANIAN </p><p>EMISSARIES ARE WELCOMED; SAUD PROMPTLY AGREED TO </p><p>VISIT TEHRAN, WHEN IRAN OFFERED TO RECEIVE HIM </p><p>PUBLICLY, AND HE ISSUED A RECIPROCAL INVITATION </p><p>WHICH VELAYATI HAS NOW ACCEPTED.  SAG POLICYMAKERS </p><p>WITH REGARD TO IRAN AND THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR, AS ON ALL </p><p>OTHER SUBJECTS VITAL TO SAUDI ARABIA, ARE THE KING, </p><p>CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH, PRINCE SULTAN, AND PRINCE </p><p>NAIF.  WE HAVE SEEN NO CLEAR EVIDENCE OF IMPORTANT </p><p>DIFFERENCES OF VIEW AMONG THE FOUR OF THEM.  THEY </p><p>APPEAR TO BE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>ON THE BASIC HOSTILITY OF THE IRANIAN REGIME AND </p><p>THE THREAT IT CONTINUES TO CONSTITUTE FOR THE </p><p>AL SAUD.  THEY APPEAR AGREED ON THE NEED TO BE FIRM </p><p>BUT NOT FOOLHARDY TOWARD IRAN, AS DEMONSTRATED </p><p>IN LAST SUMMER\'S SHOOTDOWN OF AT LEAST ONE IRANIAN </p><p>F-4, FOLLOWED BY PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RSAF\'S </p><p>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND A CONCILIATORY STANCE </p><p>TOWARD IRAN.  THERE HAVE BEEN HINTS IN THE PAST </p><p>THAT CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH MAY FLIRT WITH THE </p><p>IRANIAN EXILE OPPOSITION, BUT THIS WOULD APPEAR </p><p>LITTLE MORE THAN KEEPING IN TOUCH. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE SAUDIS WOULD OF COURSE WISH, ON BEHALF ALSO </p><p>OF THEIR GCC ALLIES, TO DISCUSS A BROAD RESOLUTION </p><p>OF THE CONFLICT--NOT LIMITED MEASURES SUCH AS A </p><p>HALT TO BOMBING CITIES OR TANKERS.  THE SAG STANDS </p><p>READY--PREFERABLY THROUGH THE GCC OR THE OIC--TO </p><p>PROMOTE MEDIATION WHENEVER THERE ARE CLEAR SIGNS </p><p>THAT IRANIAN INTRANSIGENCE HAS ABATED SUFFICIENTLY </p><p>TO OFFER SERIOUS HOPE OF PROGRESS.  THEY ARE ALSO </p><p>ACTIVE, OF COURSE, IN URGING OTHERS TO WITHHOLD </p><p>ARMS FROM IRAN OR TO PRESS IRAN TO MOVE TOWARD </p><p>NEGOTIATION.  IN THE MEANTIME, THEY WILL CONTINUE </p><p>SUPPORTING IRAQ FINANCIALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY, </p><p>WHILE MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THEY WISH TO SEE IRAN </p><p>EMERGE FROM THE CONFLICT INTACT AND VIABLE, AND </p><p>THEY MAY BE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE RESOURCES TOWARD </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION, IF THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A </p><p>SETTLEMENT.  SAUDIS WILL NEVER LIKE OR TRUST THE </p><p>IRANIANS--THEY DID NOT DO SO EVEN BEFORE THE REVOLU- </p><p>TION WHEN AT LEAST THEY BELIEVED THERE WERE MAJOR </p><p>SHARED INTERESTS--BUT THEY REMAIN ACUTELY CONSCIOUS </p><p>OF THE LONG-TERM NEED TO LIVE WITH THEIR LARGE AND </p><p>UNRULY NEIGHBOR, AND ARE CONFIDENT THAT, FOR THE </p><p>MOMENT, THEY HAVE FOUND THE BEST FORMULA FOR </p><p>MOVING MATTERS, HOWEVER SLOWLY, IN THAT DIRECTION. </p><p> </p><p>16.  A NUMBER OF FACTORS IN AND ASPECTS OF CURRENT </p><p>SAUDI-IRANIAN RELATIONS MERIT SPECIAL MENTION, AT </p><p>LEAST IN PASSING: </p><p> </p><p>-- LEBANON:  SAG REACTION TO THE GROWTH OF IRANIAN </p><p>INFLUENCE IN LEBANON HAS BEEN FUNDAMENTALLY ONE </p><p>OF CONCERN, TEMPERED BY A MEASURE OF CONFIDENCE </p><p>THAT SYRIA COULD AND WOULD KEEP THE SITUATION FROM </p><p>GETTING OUT OF HAND.  EMOTIONAL REACTIONS OF </p><p>INDIVIDUAL SAUDIS, UP TO AND INCLUDING HIGH </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, HAVE BEEN SHARP AND CON- </p><p>FLICTING.  THE SPECTACLE OF THE "LEBANESE NATIONAL </p><p>RESISTANCE" DRIVING THE ISRAELIS FROM SOUTHERN </p><p>LEBANON HAS ACCELERATED PULSES AND SWELLED BREASTS </p><p>AND THE "BRIDE OF THE SOUTH" WAS EMBRACED HERE AS A </p><p>TRUE MUSLIM (BUT NOL "SHI\'A") AND ARAB HEROINE.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME THE GROWING POWER OF LEBANON\'S SHI\'A </p><p>AND HIZBALLAH/ISLAMIC JIHAD TERRORISM HAS BRED </p><p>DISQUIET, WHILE IN RECENT DAYS, AMAL\'S CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN CAMPS HAS ENGAGED SAUDI </p><p>SYMPATHIES FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND REIGNITED </p><p>SMOLDERING SAUDI DISLIKE AND DISTRUST OF THE SHI\'A. </p><p>THE RETURN OF KIDNAPPED SAUDI CONSUL FARRASH AND </p><p>THE EXPLOSION OF TWO BOMBS IN RIYADH AS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER SAUD VISITED TEHRAN ARE INEVITABLY READ </p><p>HERE, CORRECTLY OR INCORRECTLY, AS A CRUDE ATTEMPT </p><p>TO SEND A MESSAGE ABOUT IRAN\'S ABILITIES TO REWARD </p><p>OR PUNISH.  IN SHORT, IRAN IN LEBANON IS A SOURCE </p><p>OF CONTINUING BUT CURRENTLY CONFUSED CONCERN HERE. </p><p> </p><p>-- SYRIA:  SYRIA\'S CONTINUED DIPLOMATIC AND LOGIS- </p><p>TICAL SUPPORT FOR IRAN REMAINS A MAJOR FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY PROBLEM FOR THE SAUDIS AND THEIR GCC ALLIES. </p><p>SYRIAN INTRANSIGENCE DESPITE REPEATED SAUDI </p><p>ENTREATIES, NOTABLY BY CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH, </p><p>CONTINUES TO MAKE A MOCKERY OF THE IDEAL OF ARAB </p><p>UNITY; TO ADD TO THE BURDENS IRAQ AND SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>BEAR AS THEY CONFRONT REVOLUTIONARY IRAN; AND </p><p>THROUGH THE SUPPLY OF ARMS (POSSIBLY INCLUDING THE </p><p>TRANSSHIPMENT OF SCUD MISSILES), TO PROLONG THE </p><p>WAR.  ALTHOUGH THE GREATEST IMPEDIMENT TO CONVENING </p><p>THE LONG-OVERDUE ARAB SUMMIT MEETING IN RIYADH IS </p><p>THE DISPUTE OVER THE LEGITIMACY OF ARAFAT\'S LEADER- </p><p>SHIP OF THE PLO (AN ISSUE ON WHICH THE SAUDIS AND </p><p>SYRIANS ARE ALSO IN OPPOSITE CAMPS), SYRIAN </p><p>SUSTENANCE OF THE IRANIAN WAR EFFORT ALSO PRE- </p><p>CLUDES THE HOLDING OF A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT.  THE </p><p>REPEATED POSTPONEMENTS HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY </p><p>AWKWARD FOR THE SAUDIS AND PERSONALLY EMBARRASSING </p><p>TO KING FAHD; ARAB DISARRAY DUE IN PART TO THE </p><p>SYRIAN STANCE TOWARD THE IRAQ/IRAN WAR HAS, FINALLY, </p><p>FURTHER COMPLICATED ARAB EFFORTS TO ELABORATE A </p><p>COMMON STAND VIS-A-VIS ISRAEL, BUILDING ON THE FEZ </p><p>PRINCIPLES. </p><p> </p><p>-- DIPLOMACY/MEDIATION:  THE SAG CONTINUES TO </p><p>SUPPORT IN PRINCIPLE ALL MEDIATION EFFORTS, DESPITE </p><p>ITS REALISTIC APPRECIATION THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE </p><p>TO PROVE FUTILE UNTIL IRAN FINDS ITSELF UNABLE </p><p>TO ESCAPE THE CONCLUSION THAT IT MUST SEEK A </p><p>NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT.  IN PARTICULAR, THE SAG </p><p>CONTINUES IN A LOW-KEY MANNER TO ENCOURAGE AND </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN EFFORTS OF THE OIC, THE GCC AND THE </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE, AS IT CONTINUES TO CULTIVATE RELATIONS </p><p>AND MAINTAIN A LIMITED DIALOGUE ON THE WAR WITH </p><p>NATIONS IT SEES AS POSSIBLE MEDIATORS WHEN THE </p><p>TIME IS RIGHT, PRINCIPALLY TURKEY, PAKISTAN, SYRIA </p><p>AND ALGERIA.  SAUDI ARABIA AND ITS GULF ALLIES HAVE </p><p>FOUND THE SECURITY COUNCIL RECEPTIVE TO THEIR </p><p>EFFORTS TO STIGMATIZE AND ISOLATE IRAN BECAUSE OF </p><p>ITS PROSECUTION OF THE WAR BUT HAVE RESIDUAL DOUBTS </p><p>ABOUT MEDIATION BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO AT </p><p>LEAST UNTIL HIS GULF SWING AND VISIT TO TEHRAN WAS </p><p>SEEN AS UNCONCERNED ABOUT ENDING THE WAR AND BIASSED </p><p>TOWARD TEHRAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- PROPAGANDA:  AN FSN WHO HAS BEEN MONITORING </p><p>ARABIC-LANGUAGE BROADCASTS FROM IRAN REPORTS THAT </p><p>IRANIAN PROPAGANDA HAS CONTINUED UNABATED IN RECENT </p><p>WEEKS, WITH NON-STOP ATTACKS ON GULF REGIMES AND </p><p>THEIR SUPPORT FOR IRAQ, ON THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF HOSNI MUBARAK, ON KING HUSSEIN, ON THE U.S. AND </p><p>ON ISRAEL.  ATTACKS ON THE SAG, HOWEVER, DROPPED </p><p>OFF SHARPLY DURING AND AFTER FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD\'S </p><p>MAY 18-20 VISIT TO TEHRAN AND CONTINUE TO BE HELD </p><p>IN ABEYANCE. WE BELIEVE AN FBIS READING ON IRANIAN </p><p>PROPAGANDA WOULD BE USEFUL, BUT OUR FSN\'S READING </p><p>SEEMS TO US CONSISTENT WITH IRAN\'S CURRENT EFFORT </p><p>TO VEIL THE UNCOMPROMISING IDEOLOGY THAT HOLDS SWAY </p><p>THERE WITH DIPLOMATIC CIVILITY AND MERELY VERBAL </p><p>FLEXIBILITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL ATTITUDES, ELITE AND POPULAR: </p><p>AT THE LEVEL OF THE ULEMA AND OTHER ISLAMICALLY- </p><p>EDUCATED SAUDIS, WE PERCEIVE A DIVISION OF THOUGHT </p><p>AND FEELING BETWEEN REGARDING THE IRANIANS AND </p><p>OTHER SHI\'A AS BROTHER MUSLIMS, WITH WHOM THE </p><p>TIES OF SHARED VALUES ARE STRONGER THAN THEIR </p><p>DIFFERENCES, AND A DEEPER AND STRONGER STRAIN OF </p><p>SUSPICION BASED ON THE PERCEPTION THAT SHI\'A </p><p>BELIEFS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY HERETICAL, ALMOST NOT </p><p>TRULY MONOTHEISTIC, AND THAT THEY CONTAIN IN FACT </p><p>SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STRAINS DEEPLY HOSTILE TO </p><p>SUNNI ARAB SOCIETIES.  SUCH SENTIMENTS ARE SHARED </p><p>IN CRUDER FORM AT MORE POPULAR LEVELS AND ARE OF </p><p>COURSE MIRRORED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GULF. </p><p>THE RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL ANTIPATHIES INVOLVED ARE </p><p>NEVER FAR FROM THE SURFACE AND WILL NOT DISAPPEAR. </p><p>IN SAUDI ARABIA THEY ARE, OF COURSE, SOMETIMES </p><p>EXACERBATED BY THE ALWAYS UNCOMFORTABLE, AT TIMES </p><p>TENSE, RELATIONS BETWEEN SUNNIS AND THE DISCRIMINATED- </p><p>AGAINST ARAB SHI\'A MINORITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SOVIET UNION AND AFGHANISTAN:  CONIINUING </p><p>SAUDI CONCERN ABOUT SOVIET INTENTIONS KEEPS ALIVE </p><p>SAUDI DISQUIET ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF IRAN-SOVIET </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT; AND ALTHOUGH SAUDI AFGHAN POLICY </p><p>FOCUSES ON PAKISTAN AND THE AFGHAN MUJAHIDEEN, </p><p>THE SAG COULD BE EXPECTED TO BECOME CONCERNED AT </p><p>ANY HINT THAT IRAN MIGHT DISCOMFIT AFGHAN REFUGEES </p><p>OR HINDER THE RESISTANCE IN ORDER TO AVOID </p><p>DIFFICULTIES WITH THE USSR.  FOR THE MOMENT, WE </p><p>BELIEVE, THE SAG IS REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT THE </p><p>SAME POWERFUL IDEOLOGY THAT LEADS IRAN TO REJECT </p><p>A NEGOTIATED PEACE WILL PREVENT ANY SIGNIFICANT </p><p>SACRIFICE OF MUJAHIDEEN INTERESTS TO AN ACCOMMO- </p><p>DATION WITH THE USSR.  IF, HOWEVER, A GROWING </p><p>PERCEPTION BY IRAN OF A FAILURE OF ITS WAR EFFORT </p><p>FORCES GRADUAL MODIFICATION OF IRANIAN POLICY IN </p><p>MORE PRAGMATIC DIRECTIONS, SUCH AS GREATER RECEP- </p><p>TIVENESS TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION, A POSSIBLE SIDE </p><p>EFFECT COULD BE A MORE PRAGMATIC, ACCOMMODATIONIST </p><p>IRANIAN POLICY TOWARD THE SOVIET UNION, WHICH COULD </p><p>SIGNIFY A PERIOD OF GREATER RISK FOR THE AFGHAN </p><p>MUJAHIDEEN. </p><p> </p><p>-- TRADE:  SAUDI-IRANIAN TRADE, UNSURPRISINGLY, </p><p>REMAINS MINISCULE.  SAUDI IMPORTS FROM IRAN IN </p><p>THE FIRST HALF OF 1984 AMOUNTED TO SR54.6 MILLION, </p><p>ALMOST ALL ACCOUNTED FOR BY CARPETS, NUTS, AND </p><p>DRIED FRUITS.  SAUDI EXPORTS TO IRAN WERE SR51.5 </p><p>MILLION IN 1980, UP TO SR43.8 MILLION IN 1981 AND </p><p>DOWN AGAIN TO SR22.6 MILLION IN 1982, THE LAST YEAR </p><p>FOR WHICH THE SAG PUBLISHED FIGURES FOR EXPORTS </p><p>TO IRAN.  IN 1981 AND 1982, SAUDI EXPORTS TO IRAN </p><p>CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF UREA AND OTHER NITROGEN </p><p>FERTILIZERS.  AN END TO THE WAR WOULD PROBABLY MEAN </p><p>AN INCREASE IN TWO-WAY TRADE, BUT PROBABLY NOT A </p><p>DRAMATIC ONE. </p><p> </p><p>17.  CONCLUSION:  IF THE GULF WAR IS RESOLVED IN </p><p>TIME BY NEGOTIATION OR SETTLES INTO A LONG-TERM, </p><p>LOW-VIOLENCE STALEMATE, SOME ABATEMENT OF IRANIAN </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY FERVOR AND SOME ADJUSTMENT OF IRANIAN </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY WILL PROBABLY HAVE ACCOM- </p><p>PANIED SUCH DEVELOPMENTS.  IF THIS OCCURS, LONG- </p><p>TERM PROSPECTS FOR CIVIL RELATIONS BETWEEN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA AND IRAN MAY NOT BE BAD.  THE TWO STATES </p><p>HAVE SOME PERMANENT COMMON INTERESTS THAT MAY </p><p>REASSERT THEMSELVES ONCE IRANIANS NO LONGER SEE </p><p>POLITICS PRIMARILY AS THEOLOGY.  AFTER A PERIOD OF </p><p>FLIRTATION WITH STATISM IN IRAN, BOTH REGIMES </p><p>BASICALLY FAVOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.  TRADE AND </p><p>EVEN INVESTMENT COULD GROW.  BOTH STATES HAVE </p><p>ABUNDANT OIL RESERVES AND A CONCERN OR INTEREST </p><p>IN MAINTAINING OPEC SOLIDARITY.  BOTH STATES, TOO, </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE AN INTEREST IN PREVENTING </p><p>IRAQ FROM BECOMING TOO POWERFUL.  (THIS OVER TIME </p><p>COULD DEVELOP INTO A SHARED INTEREST IN MAINTAINING </p><p>A THREE-WAY BALANCE OF POWER AMONG IRAQ, IRAN AND </p><p>THE GCC.)  BOTH STATES, OBVIOUSLY FOR VERY DIFFERENT </p><p>REASONS, HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SUPERPOWER INVOLVE- </p><p>MENT IN GULF AFFAIRS (ALTHOUGH THE SAUDIS CLEARLY </p><p>DO NOT OBJECT TO THE MODEST "OVER THE HORIZON" </p><p>U.S. NAVY PRESENCE AND THAT REPRESENTED BY THE </p><p>SHIPS OF COMIDEASTFOR).  FINALLY, BOTH STATES SHARE </p><p>AN ANTIPATHY FOR THE SOVIET UNION AND DESIRE TO </p><p>MAKE THE PRICE IT IS PAYING IN AFGHANISTAN AS </p><p>HIGH AS POSSIBLE.  IF THE IRANIAN URGE TO ACHIEVE </p><p>ITS GOALS BY MILITARY MEANS DECLINES AND IF </p><p>IRANIAN IDEOLOGY MODERATES IN THE FACE OF POLITICAL, </p><p>ECONOMIC AND MILITARY FRUSTRATION, THEN SUCH SHARED </p><p>VIEWS AND INTERESTS MAY AGAIN COME TO THE FORE. </p><p>THIS IS CLEARLY A SAUDI HOPE, AND A POSSIBILITY </p><p>THE SAG STRONGLY DESIRES TO KEEP ALIVE, EVEN AS </p><p>IT EMPHASIZES ITS PREEMINENT SHORT-TERM GOAL </p><p>OF HELPING AVOID AN IRAQI DEFEAT.  END CONCLUSION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUDDARTH </p><p></p></div>
