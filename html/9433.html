<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000846 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BANKS: STILL AWAITING SENTENCING </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 560 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The situation for some of Burma\'s largest </p><p>private banks may have stabilized for the time being, though </p><p>it is still critical.  The government, despite some tinkering </p><p>around the edges, has still not revealed its vision for the </p><p>future.  We\'re sure of only two things: the economy will limp </p><p>along without causing political discontent, and there will be </p><p>some shell of a private banking sector at the end of the </p><p>tunnel.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Banking Situation: A Move out of ICU? </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The government has done little in the past several </p><p>months to definitively resolve the predicament of the </p><p>nation\'s private banking sector.  Private bankers tell us </p><p>that they are still required to report nightly to the </p><p>government\'s Private Bank Management Committee detailed </p><p>information on that day\'s withdrawals, transfers, and loan </p><p>repayments.  Despite this regular interaction between bankers </p><p>and regulators, there are apparently no discussions or </p><p>consultations on root problems or next steps.  The government </p><p>has not moved beyond its March instructions to banks: collect </p><p>all outstanding loans, bad or good, to repay depositors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Despite this uncertain situation, two bankers with </p><p>whom we spoke said that their banks (both in the top six by </p><p>deposits) had stabilized, though their condition was still </p><p>critical.  With the current restrictions in place, recovery </p><p>and normal operations were not possible.  These two banks </p><p>were not extending new credit or taking new deposits, </p><p>allegedly on the instruction of the Bank Management </p><p>Committee.  However, the two banks had paid out between 50-65 </p><p>percent of their deposits and recovered around 50-60 percent </p><p>of outstanding loans.  With this, each bank had about an </p><p>equal amount of remaining deposits and loans trickling in and </p><p>out.  This tenuous balance was being padded by fees earned </p><p>from a recovering demand for intrabank transfers, now about </p><p>40 percent of pre-crisis levels at one large bank, and </p><p>savings from expanding layoffs and asset sales.  The two </p><p>bankers said they thought this basic stability was the case </p><p>for the other major private banks as well.  However, other </p><p>sources have told us that Yoma Bank, the country\'s second </p><p>largest private bank, was suffering more serious liquidity </p><p>problems because of difficulties getting loans repaid. </p><p> </p><p>Government\'s Response: Bad Medicine? </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In early June the Central Bank took steps to tighten </p><p>practices supposedly being abused by private banks.  First, </p><p>the Central Bank informed all private banks that as of </p><p>October 1 they would have to repay or transfer to another </p><p>type of account all call deposit accounts.  These call </p><p>deposit accounts were popular with banks, and depositors, as </p><p>they offered an annual 4-10 percent interest rate, compounded </p><p>daily, with no restrictions on withdrawals.  A banking source </p><p>said these accounts were used by banks to entice inflows of </p><p>"hot" money to mask poor liquidity ratios.  A second move by </p><p>the Central Bank raised the interest rate for outstanding </p><p>Central Bank credit lines immediately from 11 percent to 13 </p><p>percent, and demanded repayment of outstanding credit lines </p><p>ASAP.  Again, regulators suspected banks were abusing their </p><p>lines of credit, with the lower interest rate, to paper over </p><p>structural problems and fuel irresponsible lending. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Though both of these moves are sensible, their </p><p>promulgation at this sensitive time, and with no accompanying </p><p>assistance or reforms, may cause further hardship to the </p><p>larger private banks, which hold more call deposits and </p><p>Central Bank credit.  According to statistics, Asia Wealth </p><p>Bank (the country\'s largest) has an outstanding 15 billion </p><p>kyat (about $15 million) line of credit with the Central </p><p>Bank.  Yoma, Kanbawza Bank, and Myanmar Overseas Bank hold 5 </p><p>billion, 5 billion, and 1.5 billion kyat respectively. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Despite its latest marginal actions, the government </p><p>has yet to release a new set of guidelines explaining the </p><p>future of the private banking sector.  There\'s been no major </p><p>new directive since March, when the government refused to </p><p>bail out the banks and demanded that borrowers immediately </p><p>repay their loans.  For several months bankers and economists </p><p>have been predicting that these new guidelines will come </p><p>"next month."  However, to date there\'s been nothing firm, </p><p>only rumors that the Bank Management Committee had given an </p><p>extra three to six months for banks to recover their </p><p>outstanding loans and rebuild their capital base with cash, </p><p>or other very liquid assets.  After that, the rumor goes, the </p><p>government will issue clean bills of health to those banks </p><p>that have met the challenge, and dispose, somehow, of those </p><p>that haven\'t.  The future is uncertain even for those that </p><p>make the cut, though, with additional rumors that the Central </p><p>Bank will merge these banks with government or </p><p>semi-government banks, or hang stringent new operating </p><p>requirements on survivors.  There is speculation that all new </p><p>loans will have to get Central Bank approval, and that </p><p>paid-in capital requirements will be much higher. </p><p> </p><p>Business Community Down, But Not Out </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The business community has found a way to get along </p><p>for five months without a reliable private banking sector. </p><p>Though bankers report that they are no longer helping out </p><p>employers with large withdrawals to meet payroll, business </p><p>community leaders say that most companies are getting by </p><p>through diversification, the sale of assets, laying off of </p><p>workers, or cutting salaries.  The informal domestic </p><p>financial network is also helping by picking up some of the </p><p>slack for credit and fund transfers.  The availability of </p><p>intrabank transfers is also keeping commerce from collapsing </p><p>entirely.  Diversified companies, those with access to black </p><p>market money or lucrative government contracts (government </p><p>banks are still operating without difficulty) are also better </p><p>able to weather the economic storm. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Also helping the sluggish economy is a relatively </p><p>stable inflation rate, brought to heel because of the </p><p>economic slowdown and reduction in both money supply and </p><p>circulation caused by the banking meltdown.  The monthly </p><p>consumer price index declined three out of the last five </p><p>months, and held stable in the other two.  The unintended </p><p>consequences of the crisis and the government\'s reaction have </p><p>also kept the kyat stable against the dollar, defying </p><p>pre-crash expectations that the kyat\'s depreciation would </p><p>continue unabated. </p><p> </p><p>Throw Away the Crystal Ball </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Prognostication on the banking situation is often a </p><p>fool\'s errand.  However, we draw two conclusions after five </p><p>months.  First, the banking crisis has caused an economic </p><p>slowdown and layoffs, but there will be no resulting </p><p>political upheaval.  The informal economy and people\'s </p><p>general tolerance for economic misfortune have softened the </p><p>blows.  Second, when the situation is finally resolved, there </p><p>will be a private banking sector of some shape and size. </p><p>However, some important questions that remain are: How many </p><p>banks will be liquidated/merged?  How independent will the </p><p>survivors be? and perhaps most importantly, Will a critical </p><p>mass of customers come back to the revived banks and risk </p><p>losing their money once again? </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
