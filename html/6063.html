<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000358 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:  3/3/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, PHUM, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Chief LTTE negotiator in Sri Lanka to prepare </p><p>for next round of talks </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  (A) Colombo 229 and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam\'s </p><p>chief negotiator Anton Balasingham is visiting Sri Lanka </p><p>from March 2 to 16.  The visit is seen by many as an </p><p>opportunity for Balasingham to prepare for the next </p><p>round of peace talks and to brief the LTTE leadership on </p><p>the international community\'s view of the LTTE.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On March 2 LTTE chief negotiator and leading </p><p>theoretician Anton Balasingham arrived in Sri Lanka for </p><p>discussion with the LTTE leadership in preparation for </p><p>the March 18-21 round of peace talks being held in </p><p>Japan.  Balasingham is scheduled to meet with a wide </p><p>variety of LTTE representatives during his stay of </p><p>almost two weeks.  He is reportedly scheduled to meet </p><p>with LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran sometime on </p><p>March 3. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In reviewing the reason for Balasingham\'s visit, </p><p>Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, leader of the All Ceylon </p><p>Tamil Congress and member of the Tamil National </p><p>Alliance, believes that clearly the most important </p><p>reason for the visit is for Balasingham to receive </p><p>instructions for the next round of talks.  Particular </p><p>emphasis, according to Ponnambalam, will be placed on </p><p>the financial structure between the GSL and LTTE and on </p><p>the steps the government must take to attain "normalcy" </p><p>for Tamil civilians.  Ponnambalam, who recently met with </p><p>the LTTE leadership, commented that the LTTE is </p><p>concerned about how it will raise taxes and how it will </p><p>be able to distribute any funds donated by the </p><p>international community.  The LTTE believes it has a </p><p>right to tax the people in the north and east and wants </p><p>to make sure that its right to do so is acknowledged by </p><p>the GSL. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ponnambalam further reported that the issue of </p><p>normalcy for Tamils, with a focus on resettlement of </p><p>IDPs and the military security zones in Jaffna, is of </p><p>paramount importance to the LTTE.  He commented that the </p><p>LTTE had considered postponing the talks scheduled to </p><p>take place in Japan March 18-21, because the GSL was not </p><p>working towards normalcy quickly enough. Particularly </p><p>the ministry responsible for resettling IDPs had no </p><p>plans and was just permitting a bad situation on the </p><p>ground to get worse.  Multiple families claiming the </p><p>same house, families not being able to return because of </p><p>security zones, and families impoverished for more than </p><p>a decade were among the problems Ponnambalam cited. </p><p>Based on this assessment, Ponnambalam believes that </p><p>Balasingham will hear a chorus of voices, including </p><p>Prabhakaran\'s, instructing him to push for the </p><p>government to implement further humanitarian </p><p>improvements.  The hard-line LTTE cadre will argue that </p><p>they are unable to see improvements on the ground and </p><p>will push Balasingham to get concessions from the Sri </p><p>Lankan military. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Other observers add that although the stated </p><p>purpose of Balasingham\'s visit is to prepare for the </p><p>next round of talks there are a number of bonuses to the </p><p>trip.  Perhaps most importantly, according to Jehan </p><p>Perera the director of a well-regarded local think tank, </p><p>is that Balasingham will expose the LTTE to the views of </p><p>the international community.  He commented that many of </p><p>the cadre isolated in the LTTE controlled Wanni, in </p><p>northern Sri Lanka, rely on each other to reinforce </p><p>their preexisting views while Balasingham will expose </p><p>them to new trains of thought.  Kethesh Loganathan of </p><p>the Center for Policy Alternatives, another local think </p><p>tank, agrees that the trip might expose the cadre to a </p><p>more moderate view of the LTTE\'s struggle, but he </p><p>questions how much influence Balasingham will have on </p><p>the second tier of LTTE leadership. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) All of the interlocutors agreed that having </p><p>Balasingham in the Wanni would increase the </p><p>international community\'s access to Prabhakaran.  Tomas </p><p>Stangeland, Political Officer at the Norwegian Embassy, </p><p>commented that Prabhakaran tends not to meet with </p><p>representatives from the international community when </p><p>Balasingham is not present.  The Norwegian Embassy has </p><p>confirmed that Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen </p><p>is scheduled to meet with Prabhakaran on March 14.  The </p><p>Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission has also confirmed that </p><p>Tryggve Tellefsen the new Head of Mission is scheduled </p><p>to meet with LTTE leadership on March 5.  Some Tamil </p><p>National Alliance MPs are scheduled to meet with </p><p>Balasingham on March 7.  Other likely visitors include </p><p>representatives from UNICEF and Ian Martin, formerly of </p><p>Amnesty International, who will address humanitarian </p><p>issues.  (Note:  The press is speculating on numerous </p><p>possible visits, only a few of which may actually take </p><p>place.  For example, Tamil Net states that Yasusi </p><p>Akashi, Japan\'s special envoy to Sri Lanka, will be </p><p>meeting with Balasingham and Prabhakaran, Koji Yagi of </p><p>the Japanese Embassy, however, has confirmed that Akashi </p><p>does not plan to visit Sri Lanka again before the next </p><p>round of talks.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment:  Balasingham attended two rounds of </p><p>peace talks without first visiting the Wanni.  Observers </p><p>have commented that this isolated the hardcore LTTE more </p><p>from the peace process and limited what Balasingham </p><p>could commit to.  Now everyone supporting the peace </p><p>process sees Balasingham\'s visit as crucial in </p><p>forwarding the peace agenda.  At the same time that the </p><p>LTTE is expecting Balasingham to get the GSL to deliver </p><p>on its demands during the talks, observers are hoping </p><p>that Balasingham will be able to drag hard-line LTTE </p><p>cadre into the peace process.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
