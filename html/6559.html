<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 001004 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EUR/PRA FOR CAGAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL ENTRY OF FORCES INTO </p><p>KUWAIT, PROVIDED THEY ARE UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE UNITED </p><p>STATES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic, reason: 1.5 (A) and (B) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  THE GOK HAS AUTHORIZED NEW COALITION FORCES TO ENTER </p><p>INTO KUWAIT WITHOUT A SIGNED STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT, </p><p>PROVIDED (A) THEY ARE UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE UNITED STATES </p><p>AND (B) SOFA NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING.  THE AUTHORIZATION, IN </p><p>A FORM SIMILAR TO THAT GRANTED TO THE CZECHS IN JANUARY, HAS </p><p>NOW BEEN EXTENDED TO ALL NATIONS OF THE COALITION CURRENTLY </p><p>WITHOUT STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENTS WITH THE STATE OF KUWAIT. </p><p> CENTCOM PLANNERS MAY NOW PROCEED WITH DEPLOYMENTS OF TROOPS </p><p>FROM NEW MEMBERS OF THE COALITION WITH/WITH THE FOLLOWING </p><p>STIPULATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>A)  FOR THE U.S. MILITARY:  ALL DEPLOYMENTS MUST/MUST STILL </p><p>BE UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE UNITED STATES AND APPROVED BY THE </p><p>GOK IN ADVANCE.  THIS IS A SIMPLE TASK, BUT IT MUST BE DONE </p><p>IN COORDINATION WITH THE OFFICE OF MILITARY </p><p>COOPERATION-KUWAIT.  OMC-K VICE COLONEL CHRISTOPHER CAMPBELL </p><p>CAN PROVIDE GUIDANCE.  DO NOT/NOT ATTEMPT TO LAND TROOPS OF </p><p>COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT HAVE SOFAS WITH THE GOK WITHOUT PRIOR </p><p>APPROVAL.  THEY WILL NOT BE GIVEN CLEARANCE AND MAY BE </p><p>RETURNED HOME. </p><p> </p><p>B)  FOR EMBASSIES:  THIS IS NOT/NOT AN EXEMPTION FROM THE </p><p>REQUIREMENT TO CONCLUDE BILATERAL SOFAS BETWEEN THE HOST AND </p><p>SENDING COUNTRIES.  EMBASSIES SHOULD STILL PROVIDE THE </p><p>STANDARD KUWAITI SOFA LANGUAGE TO PROSPECTIVE SENDING </p><p>GOVERNMENTS FOR NEGOTIATION AND CONCLUSION WITH THE GOK. </p><p>THIS IS ONLY A GOK CONCESSION TO ALLOW MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION </p><p>OF NEW COALITION MEMBERS IN THE COALITION WITH A MINIMUM OF </p><p>PAPERWORK.  THE SOFA REMAINS A FORMAL REQUIREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS ON SOFA ISSUES IN KUWAIT, </p><p>CONTACT DCM FRANK URBANCIC, (965) 539-4723 OR ON SIPRNET. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
