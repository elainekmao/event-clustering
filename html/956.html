<p>UNCLAS STATE 156972 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, ASEC </p><p>SUBJECT: EXECUTIVE ORDER AMENDMENT: USAMA BIN LADIN </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) POSTS MAY DRAW FROM THE FOLLOWING POINTS IN </p><p>BRIEFING HOST COUNTRY INTERLOCUTORS AND RESPONDING TO </p><p>INQUIRIES CONCERNING THE PRESIDENT\'S DECISION TO AMEND </p><p>EXECUTIVE ORDER 12947 TO INCLUDE USAMA BIN LADIN AND HIS </p><p>KEY ASSOCIATES. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) BEGIN POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>--   ON AUGUST 20,  1998, PRESIDENT CLINTON AMENDED EXECUTIVE </p><p>ORDER NUMBER 12947 TO ADD USAMA BIN LADIN AND THE "ISLAMIC </p><p>ARMY", AS WELL AS TWO KEY BIN LADIN ASSOCIATES, ABU HAFS </p><p>AL-MASRI AND RAFA\'I AHMAD TAHA MOUSA,    TO THE LIST OF </p><p>TERRORISTS SUBJECT TO THE PROHIBITIONS CONTAINED IN THAT </p><p>EXECUTIVE ORDER.    THESE PROHIBITIONS INCLUDE THE BLOCKING </p><p>OF ALL PROPERTY AND INTERESTS IN THE PROPERTY OF THE </p><p>TERRORISTS,  THE PROHIBITION OF ANY TRANSACTION OR DEALING </p><p>BY UNITED STATES PERSONS OR WITHIN THE UNITED STATES IN </p><p>PROPERTY OR INTERESTS IN PROPERTY OF THE TERRORISTS, AND </p><p>THE PROHIBITION OF ANY TRANSACTION BY ANY UNITED STATES </p><p>PERSONS OR WITHIN THE UNITED STATES THAT EVADES OR AVOIDS, </p><p>OR HAS THE PURPOSE OF EVADING OR AVOIDING, ANY OF THE </p><p>PROHIBITIONS SET FORTH IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE PRESIDENT FIRST ISSUED THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER ON </p><p>JANUARY 23,  1995, TO COUNTER THE THREAT POSED BY GRAVE ACTS </p><p>OF VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY FOREIGN TERRORISTS SEEKING TO </p><p>DISRUPT THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS.   SUCH TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES POSE AN UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY THREAT TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>--   USAMA BIN LADIN AND HIS ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSOCIATES </p><p>HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED UPON THEIR SUPPORTERS TO PERFORM </p><p>ACTS OF VIOLENCE.   BIN LADIN HAS DECLARED THAT KILLING </p><p>AMERICANS AND THEIR ALLIES "IS AN INDIVIDUAL DUTY FOR EVERY </p><p>MUSLIM IN ORDER TO LIBERATE THE AL-AQSA MOSQUE AND THE HOLY </p><p>MOSQUE." </p><p> </p><p>--   WE BELIEVE IT IS ESSENTIAL TO THWART THE ABILITY OF </p><p>USAMA BIN LADIN AND HIS ASSOCIATES TO FINANCE AND CARRY OUT </p><p>TERRORISM.     BIN LADIN DIRECTS A NETWORK THAT ORGANIZES, </p><p>FUNDS, AND INSPIRES A WIDE RANGE OF ISLAMIC EXTREMIST </p><p>GROUPS WHICH PERPETRATE ACTS OF TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD. </p><p>THE BIN LADIN NETWORK IS MULTI-NATIONAL AND HAS ESTABLISHED </p><p>A WORLDWIDE PRESENCE.   SENIOR FIGURES IN THE NETWORK ARE </p><p>ALSO SENIOR LEADERS IN OTHER ISLAMIC TERRORIST NETWORKS, </p><p>INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AS </p><p>FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS,  SUCH AS THE EGYPTIAN AL- </p><p>GAMA\'AT AL-ISLAMIYYA AND THE EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD. </p><p> </p><p>--   WE HAVE CONVINCING INTELLIGENCE THAT BIN LADIN\'S </p><p>NETWORK, WORKING WITH OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS, WAS BEHIND </p><p>THE HEINOUS ATTACKS OF AUGUST 7 AGAINST THE U.S. EMBASSIES </p><p>IN NAIROBI, KENYA AND DAR ES SALAAM,  TANZANIA. ELEMENTS OF </p><p>BIN LADIN\'S NETWORK WERE ALSO INVOLVED LAST WEEK IN A PLOT </p><p>TO ATTACK OTHER U.S. EMBASSIES. </p><p> </p><p>--  THESE LATEST ATROCITIES IN AFRICA ARE NOT THE FIRST </p><p>OCCASION IN WHICH MEMBERS OF BIN LADIN\'S NETWORK HAVE </p><p>CARRIED OUT ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST AMERICA AND ITS </p><p>FRIENDS. </p><p> </p><p>--   THE BIN LADIN NETWORK SUPPORTS TERRORISTS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, BOSNIA, CHECHNYA, TAJIKISTAN,  SOMALIA, YEMEN, </p><p>AND NOW KOSOVO.   IT ALSO TRAINS MEMBERS OF TERRORIST </p><p>NETWORKS FROM SUCH DIVERSE COUNTRIES AS THE PHILIPPINES, </p><p>ALGERIA AND ERITREA.   ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE RELIABLE </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT THE BIN LADIN NETWORK HAS BEEN ACTIVELY </p><p>SEEKING TO ACQUIRE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,  INCLUDING </p><p>CHEMICAL WEAPONS. </p><p> </p><p>--   WE ENCOURAGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO UNDERTAKE SIMILAR </p><p>EFFORTS TO DISRUPT THE ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL DEALINGS OF </p><p>BIN LADIN AND HIS ASSOCIATES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MINIMIZE CONSIDERED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
