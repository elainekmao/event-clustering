<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000718 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND DRL </p><p>. </p><p>CAIRO FOR J.MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, EPET, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  WARRI CRISIS COMING TO A HEAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. DAO ABUJA IIR 6 B871 0098 03 (17APR03) </p><p>     B. ABUJA 716 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary:  In the dense mangrove swamps of Delta State, </p><p>a group of perhaps 300 militant and well-armed Ijaw youths </p><p>last month was able to shut down over 40 percent of Nigeria\'s </p><p>oil production, costing over USD one billion to date. </p><p>Although initially emanating from a local political dispute, </p><p>this crisis is also the product of the environment of easy </p><p>money, lawlessness, and ethnic chauvinism characterizing this </p><p>turbulent region.  As the youths continue to issue public </p><p>threats to disrupt elections and attack oil facilities, the </p><p>Federal Government, oil companies and even the traditional </p><p>Ijaw leadership, appear stumped and unable to find a </p><p>solution.  Bluntly put, the GON is at an armed impasse with </p><p>the Ijaw militants.  Unless the Ijaws back down, the GON is </p><p>likely to attack them.  The countdown to military action will </p><p>likely be after the elections, and that countdown may have </p><p>already started.   End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ijaw </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) The Ijaws assert they are Nigeria\'s fourth largest </p><p>ethnic group, numbering over 8 million.  Two organizations </p><p>based in Port Harcourt claim to represent the "Ijaw Nation" </p><p>which spans across five states -- the Ijaw National Congress </p><p>(INC) and Ijaw Youth Council (IYC).  Historically, the INC </p><p>has been more conservative.  The more aggressive IYC drafted </p><p>the 1998 Kaiama Declaration that called for the cessation of </p><p>oil production until Ijaw political and environmental </p><p>grievances were heard and addressed.  There are some 22 Ijaw </p><p>clans spread out across the coastal swamps of the states of </p><p>Ondo, Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, and Akwa Ibom.  Only two of </p><p>these are involved in the current crisis in Warri -- the </p><p>Gbaramatu and Egbeme. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) The village that appears to be the base of operations </p><p>for the Ijaw militants is Okenrenkoko, a former Itsekiri </p><p>village on the Escravos creek in Warri Southwest.  According </p><p>to NGO workers who have talked to Gbaramatu youths, these </p><p>militants are radicalized and are now beyond the control of </p><p>traditional village or clan leaders.  One NGO worker building </p><p>a school in a nearby village was confronted by a Gbaramatu </p><p>youth who said, "I could kill you right now and it wouldn\'t </p><p>mean a thing to me."  Older Ijaws admit these Delta creek </p><p>youths are outside the traditional authority structure.  They </p><p>have become an anti-establishment gang. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Many of these youths have been used to receiving </p><p>direct payments from the oil companies to refrain from </p><p>vandalizing oil installations or threatening oil companies\' </p><p>personnel. Disbursed under the guise of a community guard or </p><p>watch program, these payments average the equivalent of $300 </p><p>per month.  These widespread individual payments, coupled </p><p>with the companies\' continued practice of paying communities </p><p>or youth groups to resolve incidents such as hostage takings </p><p>or demonstrations, have underminded indigenous institutions, </p><p>delegitimized traditional leaders, and created a culture of </p><p>criminality.  Education, vocational skills, and community </p><p>elders are no longer held in high esteem; capacity to disrupt </p><p>or to be violent has become the coin of the realm. Uneducated </p><p>criminal youths have become the local power elite. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Though the demands of these Delta State Ijaws may </p><p>diverge from the aspirations of the larger Ijaw body, the INC </p><p>and IYC leaders feel restrained to disagree publicly with </p><p>those militants for fear of being labeled a sell-out or being </p><p>the victim of reprisals.  In an early April meeting with </p><p>Embassy\'s Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO), the IYC </p><p>President admitted that the Gbaramatu youth did not </p><p>coordinate their actions with IYC leadership. However, the </p><p>IYC would not condemn the Delta militants\' use of force or </p><p>threats to destroy oil installation; the IYC is in solidarity </p><p>with their struggle, he declared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) That struggle is somewhat hard to understand given the </p><p>lack of clear leadership or representation of this anarchic </p><p>armed gang in Warri Southwest.  Despite repeated pleas from </p><p>the government and even some Ijaw elders to stop fighting and </p><p>rescind the threats to oil facilities, the Gbaramatu </p><p>militants have yet to tone down their political demands for </p><p>increased representation among the ten electoral wards of the </p><p>Warri Southwest Local Government Area (LGA) and their grander </p><p>economic demands of some control over oil company operations </p><p>in "Ijaw-land."  A recent statement, attributed to the group, </p><p>proclaimed that "all the oil companies that vacated Ijaw </p><p>territory should sign a memorandum of understanding with the </p><p>Ijaw communities with respect to the development of the area </p><p>. .  .before resuming production."  In short, these youth are </p><p>advocating an inchoate yet militant nationalism.  They claim </p><p>the land is theirs, so the oil under it also belongs to them. </p><p> Thus, they also must be included as one of the important </p><p>ethnic groups in Nigeria.  Instead of talking about the big </p><p>three (Yoruba, Hasua-Fulani, and Igbo) there should now be </p><p>the big four. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Itsekiri </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Although fewer in number (estimated population of </p><p>300,000), the Itsekiri are the descendents of the 600 </p><p>year-old Warri Kingdom.  They have far greater representation </p><p>in local and state political circles and, as stated recently </p><p>by several Ijaw leaders, they have a more effective public </p><p>relations effort, with great influence over at least one </p><p>major newspaper (The Vanguard), which is owned by an </p><p>Itsekiri. The are viewed as the victims in the Warri </p><p>violence, and have vowed not to send the displaced Itsekiri </p><p>(most currently camped in Warri and Sapele towns) back to </p><p>their villagers until the Ijaw youths are subdued. House of </p><p>Representatives member for the Warri area Temi Harriman </p><p>(ethnic Itsekiri) and Itsekiri leader Chief Rita Lori told </p><p>POLCOUNS recently that they are demanding federal action be </p><p>taken to protect the "Warri Kingdom" of Itsekiri. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Boycotting and Disrupting the Vote </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) All of the Gbaramatu and part of the Egbeme clan -- </p><p>together making up a majority of the Warri Southwest </p><p>population -- boycotted the 1999 elections and boycotted the </p><p>voters registration for the 2003 elections.  Not content with </p><p>abstaining from the polls, the militant Gbaramatu and Egbeme </p><p>have sought to disrupt all polls in the three Warri LGAs. </p><p>Chief E.K. Clark, a local Warri Ijaw leader explained to CRO </p><p>that the Ijaws would not tolerate an election that would </p><p>yield inadequate Ijaw representation.  (Note: Since they </p><p>failed to register although they are more numerous than the </p><p>Itsekiri, this is tantamount to saying elections should never </p><p>be held in Warri.  This is another manifestation of militant </p><p>ethnic chauvinism.  Since the Ijaw claim to "own" the land, </p><p>the GON has no right to hold elections that would help their </p><p>rivals, the Itsekiri. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) A violent April 11 attack on the Warri North LGA </p><p>capital of Koko by Gbaramatu youth contributed to the </p><p>postponement of the National Assembly elections in the three </p><p>Warri area LGAs by a day.  Dan Ekpedibe of the Federated </p><p>Niger Delta Ijaw Communities (lately serving as the </p><p>mouthpiece for the militant Gbaramatu and Egbeme youth) </p><p>stated April 15 that "We are going to make sure on Saturday </p><p>(April 19) there won\'t be any election in our area." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Lucrative Business of Bunkering </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) Both Itsekiri and Ijaw are guilty of bunkering, </p><p>according to GON officials and oil company executives, but </p><p>the more numerous and maritime Ijaw most likely have the </p><p>lion\'s share of this trade in stolen oil.  Tapping into </p><p>Shell\'s pipelines and flow stations in Warri Southwest and </p><p>North at night, hoses are run to small tankers and barges </p><p>that come up the creeks to load the stolen crude.  These </p><p>sophisticated operations must be sanctioned by some senior </p><p>officials in Abuja, according to Shell\'s MD and other GON </p><p>officials.  According to a GON source, Naval personnel are </p><p>also involved, but they rely on the help of well armed Ijaw </p><p>militants to secure the tapped pipelines and hookup the hoses </p><p>to the tankers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(C) Shell claims it loses 80,000-100,000 barrels per day </p><p>to this illegal bunkering.  Multiple oil industry sources and </p><p>ethnic leaders subscribe to the belief that the Warri crisis </p><p>started as the result of a oil bunkering deal between corrupt </p><p>Nigerian Navy officers and Ijaw militants gone sour: the Navy </p><p>opened fire on the militants and a full fight ensued.  In a </p><p>recent meeting with Ambassador Jeter, President Obasanjo </p><p>confirmed that Navy personnel stationed in the Warri area </p><p>were involved in bunkering; he stated that the Navy Commander </p><p>responsible for Warri, Titus Aweyemi, and his deputy were </p><p>transferred to another post shortly after the crisis because </p><p>of their involvement in this illegal trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Companies cautiously resume . . . </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) Although the two affected oil companies -- Shell and </p><p>Chevron-Texaco, have resumed limited production in Delta </p><p>State, all of this is south of the Warri LGAs or off shore. </p><p>The shortfall in pre-March production is running on the order </p><p>of 300-400,000 barrels-per-day. While the oil companies\' </p><p>continue to state publicly that they are awaiting further </p><p>calm in the local security situation before moving into the </p><p>creeks of Warri, there may be another more powerful factor. </p><p>Shell\'s Director for External Relations, Precious Omuku, told </p><p>CRO that Shell is concerned that the Army will carry out </p><p>reprisal attacks on the Ijaw soon after the April 19 </p><p>elections.  This view is widely shared by NGOs in the area. </p><p>The recent movement of approximately 1,000 Ijaw from villages </p><p>to central towns such as Warri and Obe-Ijoh -- reportedly </p><p>because they fear imminent military reprisals -- add further </p><p>weight to this view. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While GON pushes peace . . . </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.(C) On the surface, the Federal Government continues to </p><p>show patience and restraint.  The Ijaw\'s repeated protests </p><p>that the Army is planning a reprisal attack on their </p><p>communities have been met by cool reassurances from the Army </p><p>spokesmen both in Abuja and in Warri that force would not be </p><p>the answer to this crisis.  Seeming to reinforce that </p><p>message, President Obasanjo summoned Ijaw and Itsekiri </p><p>leaders to Abuja for an April 7 meeting to "find a lasting </p><p>solution to the Warri crisis." This "Warri Summit" led to the </p><p>forming of a committee chaired by Minister of Defense Danjuma </p><p>that began meeting immediately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Power Shift Among Ijaw </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.(C) This crisis is not new to Delta State, but rather a </p><p>close repetition of Ijaw-Itsekiri fighting that broke out </p><p>almost six years to the day -- in early March 1997.  At that </p><p>time, Ijaw went on the rampage after the military </p><p>administrator for Delta State changed the capital of the </p><p>Warri Southwest LGA from Obe-Ijoh (Ijaw village) to Ogidigben </p><p>(Itsekiri village).  That outbreak of violence left many </p><p>Itsekiri villages in ruins, but was resolved peacefully. </p><p>(Note: The Warri Southwest LGA capital was moved back to </p><p>Obe-Ijoh in 2002 as the result of Delta State Assembly </p><p>legislation. end Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.(C) The Ijaw aggressors in the current violence, however, </p><p>appear more radicalized and much better armed  than their </p><p>brethren six years earlier.  This gang of some 300 Ijaw youth </p><p>are armed with new assault rifles and rocket-propelled </p><p>grenade (RPG) launchers and are aided by a fleet of fast </p><p>speedboats.  They have made the former Itsekiri village of </p><p>Okerenkoko their home.  From this village situated </p><p>strategically on the north bank of the Escravos Creek, they </p><p>can control a major waterway while conducting attacks </p><p>throughout Warri Southwest and Warri South LGAs.  According </p><p>to GON and oil industry sources, they barter some of their </p><p>stolen oil for weapons, ensuring a steady flow of arms into </p><p>the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Pressures </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.(C) To date, the GON has hewed to the path of dialogue in </p><p>addressing the conflict, but most observers believe this is </p><p>because it has no other choice at the moment.  A large-scale </p><p>attack by the Army and Navy would probably be indiscriminate </p><p>and result in significant human rights violations. This would </p><p>be politically costly for President Obasanjo and his PDP </p><p>governor of Delta State just before elections.  The two </p><p>ethnic factions in this crisis, however, have little faith in </p><p>a dialogue and time is not on the side of the "doves" in the </p><p>GON seeking a negotiated settlement.  With oil revenue losses </p><p>mounting, the post-April 19 government will be under pressure </p><p>to end this stalemate.  During an April 17 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Shell Managing Director Ron Van den Berg </p><p>predicted a military campaign against the Ijaw soon after the </p><p>April 19 elections.  Indications of this have been given by </p><p>Defense Minister Danjuma, who told the Ambassador on April 16 </p><p>that only "overwhelming force" would resolve this problem </p><p>(ref A), and by the Director of the State Security Service </p><p>(SSS) who told the Ambassador April 11 that an "enforcement </p><p>action" would be launched soon against the Ijaw militants </p><p>(ref B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment and Forecast </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.(C) The Warri crisis is clearly embedded in an historic </p><p>inter-ethnic feud over land and resource control.  The </p><p>purported political demands of the lawless Ijaw youth, </p><p>however, smack of attempting to place a thin veneer of </p><p>legitimacy over ongoing criminal enterprises (the large-scale </p><p>theft of oil).  It seems illogical to demand additional </p><p>electoral wards when all affected Ijaw have effectively </p><p>boycotted the electoral process.  The opportunity to extort </p><p>the oil companies and the government through their use of </p><p>force is a far more likely driving force behind the armed </p><p>toughs.  80,000 bpd at $15 per barrel would be $1.2 million </p><p>per day for the Ijaw criminals and their associates, with no </p><p>production costs to cover. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.(C) Ijaw elders see the looming military reprisals on the </p><p>horizon but seem helpless to improve the prospects for </p><p>peaceful reconciliation.  The absence of alternatives is all </p><p>too apparent. The GON appears to hold few prospects for the </p><p>peace dialogue it started in Abuja (read reftel) while the </p><p>pressures for a quick but bloody military solution mount as </p><p>conditions remain unstable in the economically vital area. </p><p>The only effective solution many see is force, overwhelming </p><p>force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.(C) A large-scale military operation against the Ijaw is </p><p>very likely in the near future, despite our own and the oil </p><p>companies\' best efforts to counsel restraint at the highest </p><p>levels of the GON.  If taken, this action will probably lack </p><p>precision, resulting in human rights abuses and could again </p><p>shut down Shell and Chevron-Texaco oil production. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
