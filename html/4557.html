<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 006952 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/P.THANOS </p><p>ROME FOR CUSTOMS ATTACHE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, IS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: QIZ UPDATE - IRAQ WORRIES, TRANSSHIPMENT RUMORS, </p><p>BUT POSITIVE NUMBERS CONTINUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Despite continuing political uncertainty in the </p><p>region, QIZ exporters in Jordan continue to report solid </p><p>production and growth.  Most exporters are booked through the </p><p>winter, some new investor interest is evident, and many </p><p>current investors are expanding production.  Many QIZ </p><p>exporters continue to voice the same business concerns that </p><p>have become a staple of the QIZ story - problems with Israeli </p><p>inputs, procedural delays, and labor cost gripes.  Adding to </p><p>this "background noise," though, is a slowly growing level of </p><p>discomfort over the political situations facing Jordan\'s </p><p>neighbors.  While increased political instability is unlikely </p><p>to derail QIZ production, West Bank violence or war with Iraq </p><p>will undoubtedly dampen new investor interest and potentially </p><p>increase QIZ production costs in the short term.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>First, The Good News </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  QIZ output numbers continue to show strong growth. </p><p>Exports from the Al Hassan QIZ in Irbid totaled over $229 </p><p>million through October 2002, a 47% increase over the same </p><p>period last year.  Similarly, QIZ exports from Al Dulayl QIZ </p><p>near Zarqa totaled over $49 million for the first 9 months of </p><p>2002, compared to $21.5 million for CY 2001.  Dulayl\'s </p><p>exports this year represent over 31% of total exports from </p><p>the Zarqa Governorate.  Based on these figures, and assuming </p><p>Tajammouat\'s numbers track in similar fashion (there are no </p><p>separate export figures for Tajammouat), the QIZ\'s should </p><p>meet our earlier estimate of $400 million in exports for 2002. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Anecdotal evidence supports these aggregate </p><p>numbers nicely.  The dozen or so QIZ exporters we have spoken </p><p>with over the past month have been upbeat about current and </p><p>planned production.  Most exporters are booked through March </p><p>2003 (bookings for April and beyond typically start around </p><p>November/December).  Indeed, a small number of exporters </p><p>claim to be booked beyond their current capacity and are </p><p>looking for local subcontractors.  A number of current </p><p>investors are buying new building space to expand long-term </p><p>production, and there has been a smattering of new </p><p>investments in the past three months.  One exporter in Kerak </p><p>noted that he was "upgrading" his production from generic </p><p>lines to labels, including Ralph Lauren and Jockey.  He also </p><p>said he had been contacted by Jones New York about setting up </p><p>a washing, embroidery, and silkscreen facility in Jordan. </p><p>Another exporter said he was talking to a potential partner </p><p>about establishing a weaving mill and attached bedsheet </p><p>manufacturing facility in the QIZ\'s. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  On the labor front, expat worker percentages </p><p>appear to be roughly stable at around one-third of total </p><p>workers.  There is a great deal of variance in reports from </p><p>the government and the private sector, though, with estimates </p><p>of expat QIZ workers ranging from 25% to 40%.  Of particular </p><p>note on the labor/social front, the management team at </p><p>Tajammouat recently inaugurated a program to boost Jordanian </p><p>employment by recruiting girls from the town of Tafileh in </p><p>southern Jordan and hosting them dormitory-style at the park. </p><p> The program has been well received in both the QIZ and, we </p><p>are told, by the Tafileh girls.  As a result, management in </p><p>Dulayl is putting together a similar program to bring in </p><p>girls from the Baqaa refugee camp to work in the QIZ\'s. </p><p> </p><p>Business Complaints </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Business complaints from QIZ exporters remain </p><p>largely the same - requests to reduce Israeli inputs below </p><p>8%, requests to improve QPR approval times on the Israeli </p><p>side, and complaints about product quality of Israeli inputs. </p><p> In addition to these usual gripes, new specific concerns </p><p>have been raised.  First, some exporters have noted that some </p><p>U.S. freight forwarders and even some customs officials are </p><p>unfamiliar with documentary requirements for imports of QIZ </p><p>goods.  Exporters say this lack of familiarity can delay </p><p>importation of QIZ goods, which can be expensive with </p><p>time-sensitive garment imports.  We have promised to raise </p><p>this issue with Customs. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  Second, a number of exporters are frustrated by </p><p>contractual obligations imposed by U.S. garment retailers. </p><p>Many retailers require exporters to work with, e.g., a </p><p>particular trim manufacturer or a particular hanger maker. </p><p>This ties the hands of exporters, who cannot source these </p><p>items out of Israel and so meet their 8% requirements. </p><p>Compounding the problem, they say Israeli trim makers etc. </p><p>have not made an effort to become "approved" suppliers for </p><p>many larger retailers for these goods. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (u)  Finally, we are hearing increasing rumors of </p><p>transshipment of third-country garments through Jordan.  In </p><p>particular, we have heard reports of (mostly Chinese) </p><p>garments being shipped in to Aqaba, re-labeled in the QIZ, </p><p>and exported as QIZ goods to the U.S.  These rumors are short </p><p>on specifics, making it difficult to track them.  Jordanian </p><p>customs has confirmed that there have been isolated incidents </p><p>of attempted transshipment.  We have also heard </p><p>counter-rumors that customs officials have refused entry to </p><p>trans-shipments and have begun to closely scrutinize QIZ </p><p>exporters with chequered pasts.  Jordanian customs has thus </p><p>far been unable to confirm those rumors. </p><p> </p><p>Uneasiness Over Political Developments </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  In addition to the usual "background noise" of </p><p>complaints over Israeli inputs, some exporters and park </p><p>managers have expressed a low, but growing, sense of disquiet </p><p>over continued political uncertainty in the neighborhood. </p><p>Some of this unease is simply generalized anxiety over the </p><p>smorgasbord of problems in the region, from possible war with </p><p>Iraq to ongoing violence in the West Bank and Israel to </p><p>increased incidents of violence against Americans in the </p><p>region.  Some exporters have cited cancellation of orders </p><p>tied to this generalized uncertainty, while others note that </p><p>new orders are coming in more slowly than usual - due in part </p><p>to a slow U.S. economy, partly to the first quarter being a </p><p>traditionally slow time, and partly to political uncertainty. </p><p> Similarly, the investment promotion officer for Tajammouat </p><p>noted that, during a recent trip to China, previously </p><p>scheduled meetings with prospective investors were canceled </p><p>at the last minute because they were no longer interested in </p><p>investing in a "war zone." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (c)  This generalized anxiety has been compounded by </p><p>growing concern over the impact of war with Iraq on the </p><p>QIZ\'s.  Specifically, exporters note that, in the previous </p><p>war with Iraq, sea and air ports in Israel and Jordan were </p><p>closed for a time and war risk insurance premiums kept boats </p><p>out of Aqaba.  Should history repeat, some exporters fear </p><p>increased production costs from raised insurance premiums, </p><p>problems importing inputs from Israel or East Asia, and </p><p>problems exporting finished goods.  They note that similar </p><p>concerns arise from the possibility of a sharp increase in </p><p>violence in the West Bank causing closure of border crossings </p><p>and hence, access to Israeli inputs.  We have continued to </p><p>reiterate both the USG\'s and the Israeli government\'s support </p><p>for the QIZ\'s, noting that the northern crossing has closed </p><p>for security reasons for only a handful of days in the last </p><p>two years, including closure after the September 11 terror </p><p>attacks in the U.S.  Exporters nevertheless continue to seek </p><p>assurances that we have contingency plans in place to support </p><p>continued QIZ operations in the event that access to Israeli </p><p>inputs is curtailed for an extended period of time. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>10.  (sbu)  Overall, news form the QIZ\'s remains positive. </p><p>Park managers and key investors are particularly excited </p><p>about the proposed QIZ event to be held December 13 on the </p><p>margins of the FTA Joint Commission meeting in Washington, </p><p>which they feel will go a long way toward relieving retailer </p><p>concerns over political instability, and will ultimately lead </p><p>to increased sourcing and new investment for Jordan.  Most of </p><p>the complaints we continue to hear are normal complaints from </p><p>businessmen trying to optimize profit and efficiency.  The </p><p>Israeli and Jordanian governments are currently talking about </p><p>restructuring Israeli input requirements, and the result of </p><p>those talks should have a net positive impact on current </p><p>investors.  The fact that the complaints over the 8% continue </p><p>and that U.S. retailers are looking for contract suppliers of </p><p>inputs indicates that, once tariff relief under the FTA </p><p>approximates relief under the QIZ\'s, many current exporters </p><p>will export under the FTA, reducing costs and increasing </p><p>quality by moving away from Israeli suppliers.  On the </p><p>political side, it will be useful to have a mechanism in </p><p>place in the future to address the possibility of loss of </p><p>access to Israeli inputs for QIZ production. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
