<p>UNCLAS HANOI 002605 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, KPAO, CB, VM, CTERR </p><p>SUBJECT:  ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES BY AMERICAN CITIZENS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) HANOI 02560  B) HANOI 02559 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02605  300858Z </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) DURING RECENT WEEKS, CITIZENS/RESIDENTS OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN DETAINED IN SOUTHEAST ASIA FOR ACTS </p><p>DESIGNED TO DISRUPT AND CHALLENGE THE CONTROL OF SOVEREIGN </p><p>STATES -- VIETNAM AND CAMBODIA -- WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED BY </p><p>THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  THE GOAL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND/OR </p><p>THE ORGANIZATIONS THEY REPRESENT IS TO EMBARRASS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS OF VIETNAM AND CAMBODIA AND, MORE BROADLY, TO </p><p>IMPEDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF U.S. BILATERAL RELATIONS. SINCE </p><p>THE PRESIDENT WAS IN BRUNEI AND VIETNAM AND MEETING WITH </p><p>LEADERS OF THE AFFECTED STATES, THESE ACTIONS HAVE CREATED A </p><p>NEGATIVE BACKLASH TO OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS.  THESE </p><p>INCIDENTS NEED TO BE FORMALLY CONDEMNED BY THE USG TO AVOID </p><p>CREATING THE IMPRESSION THE USG SOMEHOW CONDONES THE </p><p>ACTIONS.  DEPARTMENT PRESS GUIDANCE OF NOVEMBER 27 ON THE </p><p>CAMBODIA INCIDENT BEGINS THAT PROCESS.  BUT, NOW THAT IT IS </p><p>CLEAR THERE ARE U.S. CITIZENS IN DETENTION WHO HAVE ADMITTED </p><p>THEIR ROLES IN THESE ACTIVITIES, THE STATEMENTS SHOULD GO </p><p>FURTHER IN CONDEMNING THE ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO BUILDING </p><p>RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM AND CAMBODIA </p><p>-- AS WELL AS WITH NEIGHBORING LAOS WHICH EXPERIENCED </p><p>SIMILAR "INTERVENTIONS" IN THE PAST YEAR.  THEREFORE, IT </p><p>WOULD SEEM APPROPRIATE FOR THE USG TO MAKE A PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT SPECIFICALLY DENOUNCING THE EFFORTS OF U.S. </p><p>CITIZENS/RESIDENTS TO INTERFERE IN OUR CONDUCT OF RELATIONS </p><p>AND TO PUT PEOPLE\'S LIVES AT RISK.  THIS STATEMENT, WHILE </p><p>POTENTIALLY UPSETTING TO SOME IN THE U.S., IN FACT </p><p>REPRESENTS U.S. FOREIGN POLICY.  (IT WOULD BE MORE </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL BUT ALSO VALID TO ADD TO THAT STATEMENT A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02605  300858Z </p><p>COMMITMENT TO PUNISH ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE VIOLATED U.S. LAW </p><p>IN THE PROCESS OF CARRYING OUT THE ACTIONS TAKEN IN AND </p><p>AGAINST VIETNAM AND CAMBODIA.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) BECAUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC NOTE DELIVERED TO THE </p><p>EMBASSY HERE CONCERNING THE LY TONG INCIDENT (REFTELS), WE </p><p>DO NOT BELIEVE THE U.S. SHOULD ISSUE A STATEMENT THAT ONLY </p><p>FOCUSES ON THE HIJACKING.  MOREOVER, GIVEN THE CLOSE VIETNAM- </p><p>CAMBODIAN RELATIONSHIP AND CANCELLATION OF THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S VISIT TO CAMBODIA -- ALMOST CERTAINLY BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE INCIDENTS OUTSIDE PHNOM PENH -- THERE IS EVEN MORE </p><p>REASON TO BELIEVE LEADERS IN THESE COUNTRIES SEE THE ACTIONS </p><p>AS LINKED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) EMBASSY HANOI RECOMMENDS DEPARTMENT CONSULT WITH </p><p>EMBASSIES IN PHNOM PENH AND VIENTIANE REGARDING THE ISSUANCE </p><p>OF A STATEMENT CONDEMNING THESE ACTIONS IN ONE COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>STATEMENT.  WE SUGGEST SOMETHING BE USED ALONG THE FOLLOWING </p><p>LINES: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS THE RECENT ACTIONS IN SOUTHEAST </p><p>ASIA BY INDIVIDUAL U.S. CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS WHO HAVE </p><p>VIOLATED THE LAW BY COMMITTING TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST </p><p>EXISTING GOVERNMENTS IN THAT AREA.  THESE ACTS VIOLATE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NORMS OF BEHAVIOR AND ENDANGER LIVES AND </p><p>SHOULD BE PUNISHED UNDER INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL LAWS. </p><p>(U. S. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ALERTED TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE WHETHER ANY U.S. LAWS WERE VIOLATED LEADING UP </p><p>TO OR IN THE CARRYING OUT OF THESE ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.)  END </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02605  300858Z </p><p>TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
