DART Field Team South traveled to the southeastern Iraqi </p><p>Governorate of Maysan on 7 May to assess security along the </p><p>main highway from Basrah to Al Amarah and within the city of </p><p>Al Amarah itself.  During the trip, the DART met with </p><p>Coalition forces based in and around the city.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>DART SECURITY ASSESSMENT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  Six DART members, including two translators, traveled </p><p>along Route 6, the principal highway northward from the </p><p>southeastern city of Basrah to Al Amarah, a city of </p><p>approximately 250,000 people.  The route is 154 kilometers </p><p>and consists of a four-lane, divided highway that roughly </p><p>follows the western bank of the Tigris River. </p><p> </p><p>3.  According to the United Nations Security Coordinator </p><p>(UNSECOORD) and the British non-governmental organization </p><p>(NGO), Ockenden, large quantities of unexploded ordnance </p><p>(UXO) are located along the route.  During the trip, the </p><p>DART saw some UXO, marked by rocks, along the sides of the </p><p>highway.  A number of abandoned Iraqi military vehicles were </p><p>seen along the route. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Coalition forces operating in Maysan Governorate report </p><p>that the local environment is secure and permissive for </p><p>humanitarian operations.  However, they issued the standard </p><p>caveat against traveling at night.  No military escort is </p><p>required in the immediate area of Al Amarah. </p><p> </p><p>5.  There was less fighting in the city than in other areas </p><p>of southern Iraq because most loyal Baathist Party members </p><p>fled before the arrival of the Coalition military forces. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>POLICE AND PROTECTION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  According to Coalition forces, security, especially at </p><p>night, is still the major concern of Al Amarah residents. </p><p>Coalition forces are trying to address this issue within the </p><p>constraints of limited personnel.  Looting continues to be a </p><p>problem.  Coalition forces are focusing patrols on </p><p>safeguarding key infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Coalition forces are also training the local police </p><p>force in basic criminal investigation duties and teaching </p><p>them to be more proactive than reactive.  The police force </p><p>is led by the former police chief, a Brigadier who switched </p><p>sides two days before the regime collapsed in Baghdad.  Some </p><p>members of the local police force continue to wear their </p><p>old, military-style, uniforms.  To deter potential abuse and </p><p>corruption, Coalition forces believe that more Coalition </p><p>military police are needed in the city to supervise and </p><p>train a new Iraqi police force. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The courthouse in Al Amarah has been extensively </p><p>damaged.  Virtually all documents were destroyed by either </p><p>Baath Party leaders prior to their departure or by the </p><p>looters who followed. </p><p>9.  There are reports of mass graves in the area but no </p><p>supporting evidence has been uncovered.  No reprisal crimes </p><p>have been reported.  Some local Baath party members are </p><p>reported under "house arrest." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>COALITION QUICK IMPACT PROJECTS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Besides working to re-establish a police force, </p><p>Coalition forces are helping the U.N. World Food Program re- </p><p>establish the Public Distribution System for food rations </p><p>and get the local grain elevator and silos working. </p><p>Coalition forces plan to provide public transportation for </p><p>teachers and students. </p><p> </p><p>11.  To help the local economy, Coalition forces paid an </p><p>estimated 17,500 civil servants in Al Amarah the equivalent </p><p>of USD 20 in Iraqi dinars seized from former government </p><p>accounts in three local banks. </p><p> </p><p>12.  The electrical grid provides only intermittent power to </p><p>Al Amarah, and many citizens rely on generators for their </p><p>power.  However, shops are re-opening, markets are busy and </p><p>full of produce, repairs are being made to damaged buildings </p><p>and businesses, and farm workers are harvesting wheat in </p><p>nearby fields.  Children are sweeping the streets and there </p><p>is a lack of rubbish in some areas not seen elsewhere in </p><p>southern Iraqi towns. </p><p> </p><p>13.  A high council, or the Secretariat, has been formed </p><p>with local leaders but, according to Coalition forces, it is </p><p>highly politicized.  A second group, the "Regeneration </p><p>Committee" has been created as a group of technical experts </p><p>to help re-establish the city\'s infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
