<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 17750 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KISL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: REACTION TO CESSATION OF SHARIA DEBATE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  LAGOS 17683 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  INITIAL PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT\'S (FMG) DECISION TO HALT </p><p>DEBATE ON SHARIA LAW IN THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY HAS </p><p>BEEN MUTED.  CRITICISM HAS PREDICTABLY COME FROM </p><p>PARTISANS ON THE ISSUE AND THOSE OPPOSED TO MILITARY </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  ATTEMPTS IN THE ASSEMBLY TO CONTEST THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ACTION WERE QUICKLY OVERRULED AND ORDINARY </p><p>BUSINESS RESUMED.  THE REACTIONS MAY PORTEND INCREASING </p><p>SKEPTICISM TOWARDS THE ASSEMBLY\'S ROLE IN THE </p><p>TRANSITION; SEE COMMENT, PARA. 6.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION TO END DEBATE </p><p>IN THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ON THE INCLUSION OF SHARIA </p><p>LAW IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION HAS SO FAR PROVOKED LITTLE </p><p>OUTCRY FROM THE ASSEMBLYMEN OR THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, MOST DELEGATES ISSUED MILD </p><p>STATEMENTS--MANY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ACTION--OR REFUSED COMMENT.  TYPICAL WAS THE REACTION OF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE LAM ADESINA OF THE IBADAN SOUTH AREA OF </p><p>OYO STATE, WHO WAS QUOTED IN THE NOVEMBER 29 EDITION OF </p><p>THE INFLUENTIAL LAGOS DAILY, "GUARDIAN," AS SAYING THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S INTERVENTION WAS "IN ORDER."  HE ADDED </p><p>THAT "ANY GOOD GOVERNMENT WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT THE </p><p>BABANGIDA ADMINISTRATION DID" TO BREAK THE SEVEN-WEEK </p><p>DEADLOCK OVER THE ISSUE.  THE SAME PAPER QUOTED EMBASSY </p><p>CONTACT OLABIYI DURAJAIYE (REFTEL) FROM IDEJU SOUTH, </p><p>OGUN STATE, AS SAYING THAT THE ASSEMBLY "GOT WHAT WE </p><p>DESERVE" FOR NOT MOVING FASTER TOWARD A COMPROMISE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MUCH OF THE CRITICISM FROM THE LAWMAKERS WAS COUCHED </p><p>IN MODERATE TERMS.  ACCORDING TO THE NOVEMBER 29 EDITION </p><p>OF THE "PUNCH" NEWSPAPER, MALLAM ABBA DABO, A STRONG </p><p>ADVOCATE OF SHARIA FROM KANO, CALLED THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACTION "SAD AND UNFORTUNATE."  HE ASSERTED THAT, </p><p>CONTRARY TO GOVERNMENT ALLEGATIONS, THE POLITICAL ELITE </p><p>IS CAPABLE OF REACHING CONSENSUS ON CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>SUBJECTS, BUT CONCEDED THAT THE ASSEMBLY WAS CULPABLE TO </p><p>THE EXTENT OF CREATING AN "IMPRESSION OF DISHARMONY" </p><p>THROUGH THE INORDINATE LENGTH OF THE DEBATE.  OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS, HOWEVER, WERE MORE FORTHRIGHT.  THE "GUARDIAN" </p><p>QUOTED SAMUEL FAGOYINBO (MUSHIN CENTRAL, LAGOS) AS </p><p>DECLARING THE MOVE A "CLEAR RAPE OF DEMOCRACY" AND </p><p>CHARGING THAT "THE FACT THAT THE RIGHT TO FASHION A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC DOCUMENT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY DOES NOT AUGUR WELL FOR THE COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  OTHER SIGNIFICANT VOICES OF DISSENT CAME FROM </p><p>PARTISANS IN THE SHARIA LAW DEBATE OUTSIDE THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY.  NOTABLE AMONG THEM WAS A STATEMENT IN THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 29 "GUARDIAN" BY ANTHONY O. OKOGIE, ARCHBISHOP </p><p>OF LAGOS AND PRESIDENT OF THE CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION OF </p><p>NIGERIA (CAN), WHICH QUOTED HIM AS SAYING THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SHOULD "STAY CLEAR" OF ANY DISCUSSION OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS ISSUES.  "PUNCH" ALSO QUOTED NOTED </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER--AND OPPONENT OF MILITARY </p><p>RULE--OLU ONAGORUWA AS STATING SARCASTICALLY THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SHOULD DISSOLVE THE ASSEMBLY ENTIRELY AND </p><p>PUBLISH ITS OWN "PRE-CONCEIVED CONSTITUTION." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  ACCORDING TO THE PRESS ACCOUNTS, THE ASSEMBLY </p><p>PROCEEDINGS ON THE DAY AFTER THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>WERE ORDERLY.  THERE WERE SOME TENTATIVE EFFORTS TO </p><p>RAISE THE GOVERNMENT ORDER FOR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR, </p><p>INCLUDING ONE ON THE PART OF EMBASSY CONTACT GAIUS YARO </p><p>OF BAUCHI STATE (REFTEL) TO THE EFFECT THAT THE MOVE </p><p>CONTRADICTED THE GOVERNMENT\'S OWN DECREE IN ESTABLISHING </p><p>THE ASSEMBLY.  ANOTHER MEMBER ALSO CHALLENGED THE </p><p>AUTHORITY OF AIKHOMU\'S SPEECH TO ALTER THAT DECREE SINCE </p><p>THE SPEECH IS NOT A LEGAL DOCUMENT AND CARRIES NO </p><p>OFFICIAL WEIGHT.  CHAIRMAN ANIAGOLU RULED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>THE SPEECH WAS IN ORDER AND SUFFICED TO REMOVE SHARIA </p><p>FROM THE ASSEMBLY\'S AREA OF DELIBERATION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE REPORTS, THE ASSEMBLY THEN PROCEEDED WITH ITS </p><p>METHODICAL CLAUSE-BY-CAUSE CONSIDERATION OF THE DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION WITHOUT FURTHER INTERRUPTION. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  (C)  COMMENT:  SHARIA\'S SUDDEN REMOVAL FROM THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY\'S PURVIEW APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN GREETED WITH </p><p>RESIGNATION IN SOME QUARTERS, AND DISCRETION AND </p><p>CYNICISM IN OTHERS.   THERE IS LITTLE IN THE PUBLIC </p><p>RESPONSE TO DATE TO SUGGEST THAT THE ISSUE WILL BE </p><p>REKINDLED IN THE ASSEMBLY OR IN ANY OTHER INFLUENTIAL </p><p>FORUM.  THE QUESTION REMAINS, HOWEVER, WHETHER SUCH </p><p>RESIGNATION IS SPECIFIC TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S ACTION IN </p><p>THIS ONE INSTANCE OR, AS WE SUSPECT, WILL CARRY OVER TO </p><p>OTHER ASPECTS OF THE ASSEMBLY\'S DELIBERATIONS AS WELL. </p><p>WHILE SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAY RALLY TO THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY IN OPPOSITION TO MILITARY INTRUSION INTO THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSEMBLY HAS </p><p>PROBABLY LOST STATURE THROUGH NOT FULFILLING THE POPULAR </p><p>HOPE THAT A CIVILIAN INSTITUTION, ALBEIT FUNCTIONING </p><p>UNDER STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES, CAN DEMONSTRATE A </p><p>CAPACITY FOR COOPERATIVE AND RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP ON </p><p>ISSUES OF CRITICAL IMPORT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LYMAN </p><p></p></div>
