<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002438 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ETRD, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  TOP OIL ADVISORS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT ENERGY FUTURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: On July 25 Assistant Secretary Kansteiner and </p><p>Ambassador </p><p>Jeter discussed oil and gas issues with Dr. Rilwanu Lukman, Obasanjo\'s </p><p>Special Advisor </p><p>on Petroleum and Energy, and the current President of OPEC.  Lukman </p><p>denied rumors </p><p>that Nigeria will leave OPEC under alleged U.S. pressure, adding that </p><p>Nigeria plans to </p><p>increase its oil and gas production within OPEC\'s quota framework. </p><p>Jackson Gaius- </p><p>Obaseki, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum </p><p>Corporation </p><p>(NNPC), and  Funsho Kupolokun, Special Assistant to the President on </p><p>Petroleum </p><p>Matters, participated in the meeting. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>OPEC: Rumors of U.S. Pressure </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Commenting on rumors that the United States is pressuring </p><p>Nigeria to leave </p><p>OPEC, Lukman said the rumors had provoked a $1.50-a barrel drop in oil </p><p>prices.  These </p><p>rumors do not reflect reality, he said, since America receives an ample </p><p>supply of oil at an </p><p>acceptable price.  A/S Kansteiner stated that it was not USG policy to </p><p>pressure Nigeria to </p><p>quit OPEC.  While U.S. policy was against cartels in general, it was </p><p>Nigeria\'s decision </p><p>whether to remain in the organization, Kansteiner stressed.  The </p><p>Ambassador questioned </p><p>whether the source of the rumors is a recently released report by the </p><p>African Oil Policy </p><p>Initiative Group encouraging the United States to import more African </p><p>oil, a report that </p><p>may have been mistaken as official. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Lukman said that Nigeria would not leave OPEC, citing as </p><p>evidence the drop in </p><p>oil prices caused by the rumored break with OPEC.  He asserted that </p><p>Nigeria benefited </p><p>from its OPEC membership and believed Nigeria would be able to obtain a </p><p>larger OPEC </p><p>quota in the near future. Lukman said the NNPC and its partners can </p><p>easily augment </p><p>production by a million barrels a day.  According to Lukman, Nigeria\'s </p><p>ability to increase </p><p>its production will allow the country to export more oil through the </p><p>OPEC framework, </p><p>with anticipated cooperation from Mexico, Norway, and Oman. (Comment: </p><p>Lukman is </p><p>not the only one worried about reports on Nigeria\'s alleged plans to </p><p>leave OPEC.  The </p><p>Venezuelan Charge recently told the Ambassador that President Chavez </p><p>had called him in </p><p>a near panic about Nigeria\'s rumored OPEC departure.  The Charge said </p><p>he assured his </p><p>President there was nothing to the rumor but that personally he thought </p><p>the Nigeria would </p><p>leave OPEC sooner rather than later. There were too many compelling </p><p>domestic </p><p>economic demands on the Nigerian Government, the Charge said, for </p><p>Nigeria to stay </p><p>within the bounds of the OPEC quota system.  End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  As President of OPEC, Lukman expressed concern about Russia and </p><p>called it the </p><p>"wild card" in the OPEC equation.  Lukman suspects Russia, despite its </p><p>recent </p><p>commitment to synchronize its production policy with OPEC, may not </p><p>cooperate in </p><p>keeping prices within acceptable limits.  Lukman said OPEC producers </p><p>may consider </p><p>augmenting production at their September meeting should U.S. economic </p><p>activity pick </p><p>up.  OPEC members are committed to "keeping the price right" and </p><p>delivering ample </p><p>supply to their customers, he said, even if the problems in the Middle </p><p>East persist. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Future Production Plans </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Focusing on Nigeria\'s contribution to world energy supply, </p><p>Lukman discussed </p><p>his country\'s plans to widen its energy base through continued </p><p>exploration and capacity </p><p>building.  He said the NNPC is well positioned to take advantage of the </p><p>world\'s </p><p>increasing demand for energy, and foresees many opportunities for </p><p>Nigeria to expand its </p><p>share of the international oil and gas markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Kansteiner asked Lukman\'s opinion on the oil development </p><p>potential around Sao </p><p>Tome. While he sees potential for increased oil production in that </p><p>region, Lukman said </p><p>most of the oil is located at such depths that technological advances </p><p>will be required </p><p>before oil can be efficiently produced.  Nigeria and Sao Tome plan to </p><p>solicit bids for nine </p><p>deepwater blocks in the Joint Development Zone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Lukman focused on Nigeria\'s developing gas resources. Although </p><p>Nigeria </p><p>depends heavily on oil today, he is optimistic that Nigeria will yet </p><p>earn as much revenue </p><p>from gas as it does from oil. Lukman emphasized that natural gas </p><p>exploration was a high </p><p>priority of President Obasanjo and that, in fact, it was Obasanjo who </p><p>had converted him </p><p>to believing that gas had as much revenue generating power as oil did </p><p>for Nigeria. </p><p>Lukman believes it is only a matter of time before Nigeria, the world\'s </p><p>tenth largest gas </p><p>exporter, amasses the necessary financial and technical ability to </p><p>become one of the </p><p>biggest exporters of natural gas.  Lukman is satisfied with the </p><p>progress of new gas </p><p>projects, including Shell\'s floating gas facility, scheduled for </p><p>completion in 2008, and </p><p>ExxonMobil\'s facility, scheduled for 2009. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Gaius-Obaseki said the United States is the market of choice for </p><p>Nigeria\'s gas </p><p>exports because of high prices.  Kansteiner replied that increasing </p><p>demand and new </p><p>infrastructure will transform the United States into an even more </p><p>attractive outlet.  While </p><p>Gaius-Obaseki acknowledged that the United States will remain an </p><p>important market, he </p><p>said the NNPC wants to diversify its market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  Lukman anticipates that West Africa will become a significant </p><p>natural gas </p><p>market serviced via the West African Gas Pipeline, scheduled for </p><p>completion in 2004. </p><p>Lukman believes construction is moving forward.  Farther in the future, </p><p>Nigeria itself </p><p>will consume more gas through a trans-Nigerian pipeline.  Years ago, </p><p>the GON </p><p>considered building a pipeline to service the entire country, but the </p><p>project was not </p><p>economically viable.  Higher world gas prices may warrant </p><p>reconsideration of the project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Delta Security and American Investment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU)  Kansteiner raised concerns held by American oil companies. </p><p>Alluding to the </p><p>recent occupation of Chevron\'s facilities in the Delta region by </p><p>disaffected women, </p><p>Kansteiner wondered whether security concerns will deter investors from </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p>Lukman replied that oil firms will continue to invest in Nigeria since </p><p>it is likely that </p><p>stability will take hold in the Delta region. Lukman nonetheless </p><p>acknowledged that </p><p>security agencies must be prepared to manage difficult situations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  Kansteiner mentioned another concern, the lack of provisions </p><p>in production- </p><p>sharing contracts, the agreements governing the deepwater oil blocks, </p><p>specifying which </p><p>party or parties own the gas development rights.  Gaius-Obaseki </p><p>acknowledged the </p><p>omission, but added that terms can be negotiated on a case by case </p><p>basis.  Kansteiner </p><p>inquired about Nigeria\'s delay in approving the recent ChevronTexaco </p><p>merger.  Lukman </p><p>replied the government is addressing this situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Comment.  Lukman\'s statements about Nigeria\'s production plans </p><p>parallel </p><p>information the Embassy and the Consulate has received from the oil </p><p>companies; they </p><p>expect Nigeria to develop a four million barrels a day production </p><p>capacity by 2010. </p><p>(However, this production measure is dependent on the GON\'s ability to </p><p>invest in the </p><p>additional capacity.  Also, it depends on the economic utility of that </p><p>added capacity.  It </p><p>would make little sense to sink money into additional production if you </p><p>cannot sell the </p><p>additional amount due to OPEC production quotas.  Lukman expressed </p><p>confidence in </p><p>Nigeria\'s ability to increase its production through a larger OPEC </p><p>quota.  As we have </p><p>previously reported, should Nigeria not obtain a larger dispensation, </p><p>over time its </p><p>production will most likely exceed the current one, as it has in the </p><p>past. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Lukman downplayed the seriousness with which ChevronTexaco </p><p>views the </p><p>GON\'s delay in approving the ChevronTexaco merger.  The company </p><p>contends that it has </p><p>followed the law and notes that Nigeria is the only country in which it </p><p>is having </p><p>problems.   Mission will continue to work toward a resolution of this </p><p>issue.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Assistant Secretary Kansteiner did not see this message prior </p><p>to his departure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.
