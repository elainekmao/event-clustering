<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000899 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB/ESC </p><p>USDOE FOR IA-42/J BRODMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECIN, EPET, VM, APEC </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM: PREPARING FOR APEC ENERGY MINISTERS MEETING </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00899  01 OF 03  280933Z </p><p>REF:  A) HANOI 471; B) STATE 71973 </p><p> </p><p>1. ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY (MOI), </p><p>MINISTER DANG VU CHU WILL LEAD VIETNAM\'S DELEGATION </p><p>TO THE MAY 10-12 APEC ENERGY MINISTERS CONFERENCE IN </p><p>SAN DIEGO.  (NOTE: THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE A MINISTRY OF ENERGY.  CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ARE </p><p>DELEGATED TO OTHER MINISTRIES OR TO STATE-OWNED </p><p>CORPORATIONS, BUT EMBASSY BELIEVES THE INDUSTRY </p><p>MINISTER IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE ATTENDEE.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  THIS MESSAGE PROVIDES REQUESTED INFORMATION </p><p>ON VIETNAM\'S ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT SECTORS AS WELL </p><p>AS PENDING COMMERCIAL ADVOCACY ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>ENERGY </p><p>------ </p><p>2. CRUDE OIL IS VIETNAM\'S MOST IMPORTANT EXPORT </p><p>COMMODITY, GENERATING ROUGHLY ONE-FIFTH OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S EXPORT EARNINGS.  CURRENT PRODUCTION IS </p><p>SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 300,000 BARRELS PER DAY, ALL FROM </p><p>OFFSHORE FIELDS.  THE COUNTRY HAS RECOVERABLE GAS </p><p>RESERVES OF 60-80 TRILLION CUBIC FEET, PRIMARILY IN </p><p>THE NAM CON SON BASIN SOUTHEAST OF HO CHI MINH CITY, </p><p>BUT THESE ARE LARGELY UNEXPLOITED DUE TO A LACK OF </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE.  VIETNAM HAS LARGE RESERVES OF </p><p>ANTHRACITE COAL, WHICH ALSO IS A MAJOR EXPORT, BUT </p><p>THE INDUSTRY SUFFERS FROM OVER-CAPACITY, OUTDATED </p><p>TECHNOLOGY, AND EXCESS LABOR. </p><p> </p><p>3. NUMEROUS U.S. AND FOREIGN ENERGY COMPANIES HAVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00899  01 OF 03  280933Z </p><p>INVESTED CONSIDERABLE CAPITAL IN EXPLORATION AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, BUT MANY HAVE BECOME FRUSTRATED WITH </p><p>BUREAUCRATIC AND REGULATORY DELAYS AND HAVE WITHDRAWN </p><p>FROM THEIR PROJECTS.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE JOINT </p><p>VENTURE (VIETSOVPETRO) WITH THE RUSSIAN COMPANY </p><p>ZARUBEZHNEFT, FOREIGN COMPANY INVOLVEMENT IN UPSTREAM </p><p>OIL AND GAS PROJECTS IS CONDUCTED THROUGH PRODUCTION- </p><p>SHARING CONTRACTS WITH PETROVIETNAM, THE STATE-OWNED </p><p>ENERGY COMPANY. </p><p> </p><p>4. VIETNAM CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE A REFINERY, SO ALL </p><p>CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION IS EXPORTED.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>APPROVED A USD 1.3 BILLION JOINT VENTURE PROJECT WITH </p><p>RUSSIA TO CONSTRUCT A REFINERY AND ASSOCIATED </p><p>FACILITIES AT DUNG QUAT IN CENTRAL VIETNAM, BUT THUS </p><p>FAR HAS FAILED TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT FUNDING.  MANY </p><p>FOREIGN EXPERTS BELIEVE THE PROJECT IS NOT </p><p>ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>5. ELECTRICITY OF VIETNAM (EVN), UNDER THE </p><p>SUPERVISION OF MOI, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR POWER </p><p>GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, AND DISTRIBUTION. </p><p>HYDROPOWER ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF </p><p>THE ENERGY SUPPLY, WITH THE REMAINDER GENERATED FROM </p><p>THERMAL (OIL AND COAL-FUELED) PLANTS.  THE GVN HAS </p><p>DISCUSSED THE POSSIBLITY OF CONSTRUCTING A NUCLEAR </p><p>POWER PLANT. </p><p> </p><p>6. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD BANK, IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS </p><p>VIETNAM WILL FACE FOUR MAJOR CHALLENGES IN THE ENERGY </p><p>SECTOR.  FIRST, DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY WILL INCREASE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00899  01 OF 03  280933Z </p><p>13-15 PERCENT ANNUALLY OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS, </p><p>REQUIRING THE ADDITION OF 600-800 MEGAWATTS OF </p><p>CAPACITY TO THE POWER GRID EACH YEAR.  SECOND, </p><p>LIMITED CAPITAL RESOURCES WILL NECESSITATE CAREFUL </p><p>PLANNING AND PRIORITIZATION OF PROJECTS.  THIRD, </p><p>VIETNAM WILL NEED TO INVEST 5.3-5.5 PERCENT OF GDP, </p><p>OR TWICE THE LEVEL OF ITS SOUTHEAST ASIAN NEIGHBORS, </p><p>IN ESSENTIAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE.  TWO-THIRDS OF </p><p>THIS WILL HAVE TO BE FINANCED WITH OFFICIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE OR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. </p><p>FOURTH, TO ATTRACT THIS AMOUNT OF FDI THE GVN WILL </p><p>HAVE TO IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY ITS INVESTMENT CLIMATE </p><p>AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.  IT MAY NEED TO CREATE A </p><p>NATIONAL ENERGY AND COORDINATIVE AGENCY AND SEPARATE </p><p>THE POLICY AND COMMERCIAL FUNCTIONS OF BOTH EVN AND </p><p>PETROVIETNAM (PVN).  THE GVN ALSO WILL NEED TO ACCEPT </p><p>AND STREAMLINE THE BOT APPROVAL PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>ENVIRONMENT </p><p>----------- </p><p>7. SINCE 1950, THE POPULATION OF VIETNAM HAS TRIPLED. </p><p>VIETNAM IS NOW ONE OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED </p><p>COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.  THE POPULATION IS </p><p>PREDOMINANTLY RURAL POOR, DEPENDENT ON THE NATURAL </p><p>RESOURCES OF LAND, FOREST, AND WATER FOR SUSTENANCE. </p><p>TO SATISFY BASIC NEEDS, INDIVIDUALS AND WHOLE </p><p>COMMUNITIES HAVE ENCROACHED ON FRAGILE ECOSYSTEMS AND </p><p>DEGRADED NATURAL RESOURCES.  THE MOST VISIBILE </p><p>MANIFESTATION OF THIS IS THE LOSS OF PRIMARY FOREST </p><p>COVER, WHICH IN THE LAST HALF-CENTURY HAS GONE FROM </p><p>OVER 40 PERCENT TO ABOUT 10 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. SINCE ABOUT 1960 THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SIMULTANEOUS </p><p>TRENDS OF INTERNAL MIGRATION: FROM CONGESTED TO LESS </p><p>DENSELY POPULATED AREAS -- AS PEOPLE SEEK LAND -- AND </p><p>FROM RURAL TO URBAN AREAS -- AS THEY SEEK WORK. THIS </p><p>MIGRATION HAS EXPANDED AND INTENSIFIED THE PATTERN OF </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. IT HAS ALSO INTENSIFIED </p><p>URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY IN CLEAN AIR </p><p>AND WATER PROBLEMS, AND WASTE DISPOSAL DIFFICULTIES. </p><p>ALTHOUGH VIETNAM IS NOW ONE OF THE LOWEST CONSUMERS </p><p>OF ENERGY PER CAPITA IN ASIA, THE NEXT DECADE WILL </p><p>SEE A DRAMATIC GROWTH IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND </p><p>PRODUCTION FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND HYDROPOWER. THIS </p><p>WILL INEVITABLY PRODUCE PROFOUND ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>IMPACTS. THE URBAN AREAS, MEANWHILE, WILL ABSORB MORE </p><p>THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE POPULATION AT CURRENT TRENDS. </p><p>WHILE POPULATION GROWTH WILL LEVEL OFF AROUND 2050, </p><p>THE ABSOLUTE INCREASE IN POPULATION AND INTERNAL </p><p>MIGRATION WILL CONTINUE TO POSE MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>CHALLENGES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>COMMERCIAL ADVOCACY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00899  02 OF 03  280933Z </p><p>------------------- </p><p>9. THERE ARE TWO PENDING POWER PROJECTS BY U.S. </p><p>COMPANIES.  BOTH HAVE ENDURED LONG DELAYS IN THE </p><p>APPROVAL PROCESS, AND MINISTER CHU SHOULD BE URGED TO </p><p>EXPEDITE THEM.  FIRST, ENRON HAS A PROPOSAL FOR A 475 </p><p>MW BUILD-OPERATE-TRANSFER (BOT) POWER PROJECT IN SOC </p><p>TRANG PROVINCE: </p><p> </p><p>-- ENRON SUBMITTED THE FEASIBILITY STUDY TO THE GVN </p><p>IN 1999. </p><p> </p><p>-- ENRON HAS CONCLUDED TWO ROUNDS OF DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY ON ITS BOT AGREEMENT, AS </p><p>WELL AS ONE ROUND OF DISCUSSIONS WITH ELECTRICITY </p><p>VIETNAM (EVN) ON THE ELECTRICITY TARIFF. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE U.S. TRADE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (TDA) HAS </p><p>PROVIDED A USD 700,000 GRANT TO ASSIST MOI IN </p><p>PREPARING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THIS PROJECT. </p><p> </p><p>(NOTE:  UNDER THE GVN\'S MOST RECENT POWER PLAN, THE </p><p>ENRON BOT PROJECT WILL NOT BEGIN OPERATIONS UNTIL </p><p>2006, DUE TO UNAVAILABILITY OF GAS FUEL.) </p><p> </p><p>10. THE U.S COMPANY ORMAT HAS APPLIED FOR APPROVAL OF </p><p>ITS 50 MW BOT GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANT IN CENTRAL </p><p>VIETNAM: </p><p> </p><p>-- IN 1998 MOI GRANTED EXPLORATION LICENSES FOR SIX </p><p>GEOTHERMAL AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00899  02 OF 03  280933Z </p><p>-- IN 1999 MOI APPROVED THE PRE-FEASIBILITY STUDY, </p><p>AND EVN AGREED TO THE POWER TARIFF SUBJECT TO A STUDY </p><p>FUNDED BY TDA. </p><p> </p><p>-- TDA HAS BEEN WORKING WITH MOI ON AN AMENDMENT TO </p><p>THE SIGNED GRANT AGREEMENT TO MEET MOI\'S REQUEST FOR </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>-- ORMAT HAS APPLIED FOR AN EXTENSION OF ITS </p><p>EXPLORATION LICENSE FROM MOI THAT EXPIRED IN </p><p>DECEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>11. MORE GENERALLY, THE LONG-PENDING BP-AMOCO </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS ON GAS SALES AND A PIPELINE FORM THE </p><p>OFFSHORE FIELDS TO VUNG TAU MUST BE COMPLETED.  THIS </p><p>WILL SET A PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE GAS SALES AND </p><p>PIPELINE NEGOTIATIONS FOR UNOCAL AND OTHER U.S. </p><p>ENERGY AND POWER COMPANIES WHICH MAY HAVE INTERESTS </p><p>IN GAS EXPLORATION.  FAILURE TO DELIVER GAS FROM THE </p><p>NAM CON SON FIELD IS DISRUPTING PLANS FOR EXISTING </p><p>AND NEW POWER PLANTS IN THE VUNG TAU AREA. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>BIO NOTE </p><p>-------- </p><p>12. DANG VU CHU WAS APPOINTED MINISTER OF INDUSTRY IN </p><p>OCTOBER 1995, FOLLOWING THE MERGER OF THE MINISTRIES </p><p>OF LIGHT INDUSTRY, HEAVY INDUSTRY, AND ENERGY.  FROM </p><p>1990 TO 1995 HE SERVED AS MINISTER OF LIGHT INDUSTRY. </p><p>HE WAS BORN IN 1940 AND EDUCATED IN VIETNAM </p><p>(BACHELOR\'S DEGREE) AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA (DOCTORATE). </p><p> </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
