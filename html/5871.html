<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000361 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TPFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ARREST OF HIGH COURT JUDGE </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 77 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Police arrested High Court Judge Benjamin Paradza on </p><p>February 16 in his chambers.   They allege that Paradza </p><p>contacted three fellow judges of the High Court in an </p><p>effort to influence them to release a passport belonging to </p><p>his business partner and friend Russell Wayne Luschagne, </p><p>who is facing murder charges. Paradza has been charged with </p><p>attempting to defeat the course of justice or, </p><p>alternatively, trying to contravene the Prevention of </p><p>Corruption Act.   After spending a night in jail, he was </p><p>released on Z$20 000 (U.S.$14) bail and asked to surrender </p><p>his passport. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Jonathan Samkange, Paradza\'s lawyer, denied the charges </p><p>in a conversation with us.  According to Samkange, Paradza </p><p>claims that Luschagne is not his business partner and that </p><p>he had only urged his fellow Judges to schedule a trial </p><p>date for Luschagne, whose murder trial has been pending for </p><p>two years.  Samkange believes the government is trying to </p><p>humiliate the  judge for ordering the mid-January release </p><p>without charge of Harare Mayor Elias Mudzuri.  As reported </p><p>reftel, Mudzuri spent two nights in jail for trying to meet </p><p>with his constituents without having sought police </p><p>permission.  Samkange reported that, two days after his </p><p>ruling in the Mudzuri case, Paradza was visited by two </p><p>Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) agents, who told </p><p>him the Government was unhappy with his decision and </p><p>intended to "embarrass him".  In addition, Paradza received </p><p>a number of threatening calls in the aftermath of his </p><p>Mudzuri judgment. </p><p>3.  Paradza\'s arrest elicited strong condemnations </p><p>from members of the legal fraternity.  In a public </p><p>statement, the Legal Resources Foundation criticized </p><p>the arrest and overnight detention as "unwarranted and </p><p>high-handed" and maintained that an "internal inquiry" </p><p>by the High Court Judge President should have been the </p><p>first step in the process before criminal charges were </p><p>brought.  "The unseemly haste with which the Judge was </p><p>arrested and detained is an affront to the dignity of </p><p>the Office of Judge and creates in the minds of the </p><p>public an unfortunate impression that Mr Justice </p><p>Paradza is being harassed for making judicial </p><p>pronouncements that have not been favorable to the </p><p>authorities."  The President of the Law Society of </p><p>Zimbabwe, Sternford Moyo, agreed with the LRF </p><p>assessment, telling us that precedent would dictate </p><p>that an internal inquiry should have been conducted </p><p>first.  If evidence of wrongdoing were found, then , </p><p>the Constitution provides the parameters for </p><p>establishment of a tribunal to examine charges of </p><p>judicial misconduct.  Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human </p><p>Rights also condemned the arrest and called for the </p><p>Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs </p><p>"to carry out his legal duty to protect the integrity </p><p>of the courts."  Param Cumaraswamy, UN Special </p><p>Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, </p><p>criticized the humiliating treatment of Paradza in </p><p>public remarks, saying it was "tantamount to </p><p>intimidation of the gravest kind.  This leaves a </p><p>chilling effect on the independence of the judiciary." </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The details of what crime Paradza is alleged to have </p><p>committed are still fuzzy.  It is possible he might have </p><p>acted inappropriately.  His arrest and detention by police, </p><p>along with that of fellow High Court Judge Fergus Blackie </p><p>last year, are unprecedented and suggest a new willingness </p><p>by the Government of Zimbabwe to intimidate judges openly </p><p>in order to ensure favorable judgments.  In the only other </p><p>two cases in recent memory in which High Court judges were </p><p>accused of misconduct, special tribunals were established </p><p>to investigate the charges.  Neither judge was arrested in </p><p>the meantime, and both continued to hear cases during the </p><p>investigation.   Although the state-controlled media </p><p>insisted that Paradza\'s arrest was not politically </p><p>motivated, the visit he received from the CIO agents and </p><p>the threatening calls suggest otherwise.  It appears as </p><p>though the Government was strongly displeased by his ruling </p><p>in the Mudzuri case and was determined to teach him a </p><p>lesson.  That lesson likely will not be lost on Paddington </p><p>Garwe, the judge presiding over the Morgan Tsvangirai </p><p>treason case, and other colleagues on the bench. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
