(A) ANKARA 4770 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 4386 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Robert Deutsch.  Reason: </p><p>1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an action request -- see para 9. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary: Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency </p><p>(BRSA) President Engin Akcakoca confirmed to us July 30 that </p><p>the agency is facing serious difficulties trying to address </p><p>the problems resulting from the discovery of massive fraud in </p><p>the Uzan family-owned Imar Bank.  The fundamental problem is </p><p>that BRSA is being beseiged by bank depositors waiving their </p><p>bank books and demanding their money back (to the tune of </p><p>billions of dollars), but the agency has no ability to verify </p><p>accounts because Imar Bank owners/managers destroyed </p><p>virtually all of the bank\'s records during and immediately </p><p>after the takeover.  Akcakoca believes perhaps 50 percent of </p><p>the accounts are fictitious -- bank books with no </p><p>corresponding account -- and speculated that the Uzans may </p><p>have handed out bank deposit books (not backed by any </p><p>account) to would-be voters.   BRSA has asked public </p><p>prosecutors to pursue the bank\'s major shareholders and 135 </p><p>managers believed involved in the fraud, and wants law </p><p>enforcement officials to begin detaining and interrogating </p><p>these people quickly; otherwise, they have little hope of </p><p>piecing together how the bank operated.  Akcakoca added that </p><p>initial indications are that an Uzan-owned bank in Northern </p><p>Cyprus also has no records.  He confided that Hakan Uzan had </p><p>approached BRSA with an offer to help resolve the Imar Bank </p><p>problem in return for a GOT decision to lift the travel ban </p><p>on the family and to return its recently-confiscated power </p><p>plants in southern Turkey.  Given strong indications of </p><p>massive fraud that could undermine BRSA and Turkey\'s efforts </p><p>to refom/stabilize its banking sector, Embassy recommends </p><p>that we highlight this issue at this Friday\'s IMF Board </p><p>review and also approach the government at the ministerial </p><p>level to urge aggressive investigation of this case and full </p><p>GOT support for and assistance to the BRSA so it can do what </p><p>is necessary to resolve the problems surrounding Imar Bank. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On July 30, BRSA President Engin Akcakoca provided us </p><p>with his views on the problems associated with the agency\'s </p><p>recent take over of Uzan-family owned Imar Bank.  As reported </p><p>in reftels, BRSA took over management of the bank and </p><p>responsibility for its $800 million in deposit liabilities </p><p>early this month.  However, it has subsequently learned that </p><p>the bank was keeping a second set of books and that total </p><p>deposit liabilities were many times greater than officially </p><p>reported, perhaps as high as $5 billion.  BRSA officials told </p><p>us they thought a substantial amount of the "additional" </p><p>deposits were either fictitious or consisted of offshore </p><p>accounts transfered to the bank in recent days, while other </p><p>accounts consisted of money legitimately deposited but never </p><p>officially reported by the bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Akcakoca said that bank managers had destroyed nearly </p><p>all of the bank\'s records, including both "official" and </p><p>"unofficial" books.  Financial crime investigators had </p><p>managed to salvage a small amount of records, which BRSA </p><p>authorities were using to piece together the bank\'s </p><p>operations.  Akcakoca believes that perhaps one-half of the </p><p>deposit liabilities consist of fictitious accounts, in which </p><p>the bank appears to have given bank deposit books with </p><p>fictitious entries to individual "customers" (he speculated </p><p>perhaps to would-be voters) with no corresponding account, </p><p>and with the "customer" not actually having made any </p><p>deposits.  He also speculated that the bank had created a </p><p>large number of such fictitious accounts in the weeks </p><p>following the government\'s recent confiscation of the Uzan </p><p>Group\'s power concessions in southern Turkey (ref b).  In </p><p>addition, the "inflated" liabilities include an unknown </p><p>number of accounts from an Uzan-family owned bank in Northern </p><p>Cyprus, transferred to Imar Bank in recent days and </p><p>backdated.  Akcakoca noted that the governor of the central </p><p>bank of Northern Cyprus had sent auditors to the bank in </p><p>question, at Akcakoca\'s request, and the auditors had been </p><p>unable to find any bank records. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Akcakoca said the BRSA had sent two thick files to </p><p>the public prosecutor\'s office urging criminal investigation </p><p>of Imar Bank\'s major shareholders and 135 managers believed </p><p>to have been involved in or to have knowledge of the bank\'s </p><p>fraudulent activities.  He said he "would have expected" law </p><p>enforcement authorities to have detained and begun </p><p>interrogations of some of these people by now, as such </p><p>interrogations are the only way the BRSA is going to uncover </p><p>the details of the fraud and other crimes. </p><p>6.  (C) BRSA is now faced with a big problem.  Every day, </p><p>dozens if not hundreds of Imar Bank "depositors" -- some </p><p>organized by the Uzans, per Akcakoca -- are coming to BRSA </p><p>headquarters waiving duly-signed bank books and demanding </p><p>their deposits back.  BRSA officials know a good percentage </p><p>of these accounts are fictitious or otherwise problematic, </p><p>but -- with Imar Bank\'s records largely destroyed -- they </p><p>have no way of knowing which are legitimate.  If they fail to </p><p>make good on the BRSA deposit guarantee in this case, they </p><p>could well undermine depositor faith in the guarantee writ </p><p>large, perhaps triggering a ruinous banking run.  If, on the </p><p>other hand, they pay back all the deposits, they reward </p><p>fraud, undermine their own credibility, and create a fiscal </p><p>problem for the Treasury. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Akcackoca said BRSA\'s current approach consists of: </p><p>(a) continuing to pore through all the records they can find; </p><p>(b) counting on criminal investigations to encourage at least </p><p>some bank managers to provide information; and (c) proposing </p><p>new legislation.  The legislation, he said, would define </p><p>deposit repayment terms in a way that would enable BRSA to </p><p>transfer most accounts to another bank or to offer government </p><p>bonds, limiting the amount of actual cash payments.  It also </p><p>would make it a crime for anyone to apply for repayment of a </p><p>deposit based on a claim that they knew was false (i.e., </p><p>using a fictitiously-issued bank book not backed by a </p><p>deposit).  Finally, it would enable the Savings Deposit </p><p>Insurance Fund (SDIF) under BRSA to seize and confiscate </p><p>assets not only of the bank, but also of bank shareholders </p><p>and officers.  Akcakoca thought the courts might find the </p><p>last provision unconstitutional, but argued that it was worth </p><p>a try. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  At the end of the meeting, Akcakoca confided to us </p><p>that Hakan Uzan (Cem Uzan\'s brother) had approached BRSA with </p><p>the suggestion that the family would help clear up the </p><p>problems related to Imar Bank\'s liabilities in return for the </p><p>government lifting the travel ban on them and returning their </p><p>confiscated electricity companies.  Akcakokca, who appeared </p><p>more frustrated than we have ever seen him, lamented that the </p><p>public is blaming BRSA for the Imar Bank problems, even </p><p>though it was the Uzan family who committed obvious fraud. </p><p>He acknowledged our point that the BRSA had supervised a </p><p>three-stage audit of the bank last year and pronounced it </p><p>fit, but argued that no one had any indication that this type </p><p>of massive fraud was underway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Action request:  Although it will take time for </p><p>authorities to put together the details of this case, there </p><p>are strong indications of massive fraud and other criminal </p><p>activities at Imar Bank.  Moreover, the bank\'s activities </p><p>could undermine the credibility of the BRSA and, to some </p><p>extent, the progress made in reforming and stabilizing the </p><p>Turkish banking system.  We suggest this should be an issue </p><p>for discussion with IMF staff at the scheduled August 1 Board </p><p>review, given that the situation has evolved since the LOI </p><p>was accepted.  Embassy also recommends that we urge GOT </p><p>authorities at the policy level to take steps to protect the </p><p>banking system from a new, generalized crisis.  Such steps </p><p>would include providing firm political support for BRSA, </p><p>launching an aggressive investigation into this apparent </p><p>fraud and, as needed, provision of technical assistance to </p><p>the BRSA so that it has the resources it needs to complete </p><p>this takeover successfully.  We recognize the political </p><p>implications (AK Party versus the Uzans) of this matter. </p><p>Nevertheless, we believe there is strong justification for </p><p>the USG to press for a full, transparent, and legally-sound </p><p>investigation and resolution of this case.  Doing so will </p><p>also reaffirm our efforts to encourage the GOT\'s </p><p>anti-corruption drive and enforcement of rule of law. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
