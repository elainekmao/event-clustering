<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001983 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 04/26/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, PREL, PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAEG REACTS -- AND OVERREACTS - TO SARS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The UAE Ministry of Health will install thermal </p><p>scanners at Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports to check the </p><p>temperatures of airline passengers as a defense </p><p>against SARS.  Passengers traveling from SARS infected </p><p>countries will submit special disembarkation cards </p><p>with their contact information in the UAE to keep </p><p>track of their whereabouts. Transit passengers from </p><p>SARS-affected countries will not be allowed off their </p><p>flights and those who need to change flights will be </p><p>sequestered in a separate hall away from other </p><p>passengers. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Medical teams have been assigned to monitor </p><p>passengers arriving from east Asia until the scanners </p><p>are installed.  If someone is observed with breathing </p><p>difficulties or a high temperature, the individual </p><p>will be isolated and given a check-up.  Passengers are </p><p>also  told to go to a public health clinic if they </p><p>feel any of the SARS symptoms within ten days of </p><p>arrival. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) An advisor to the Chairman of Abu Dhabi\'s Civil </p><p>Aviation Department Patrick Gordon, told Econoff that </p><p>a Gulf Air flight from China had been turned back in </p><p>the early morning hours of April 26 by orders from the </p><p>highest levels of the Ministry of Health and CID. </p><p>Though all the passengers had been checked for SARS- </p><p>like symptoms before they boarded the flight, </p><p>officials have become paranoid about incoming flights </p><p>from east Asia and refused permission for the flight </p><p>to land.  (Note: The flight was re-routed back to </p><p>China via Sudan and Bahrain.  End note.)  Gordon </p><p>stated that the UAE\'s response to SARS was in a state </p><p>of flux and that officials were meeting to coordinate </p><p>a permanent plan for air travel from east Asia, which </p><p>might possibly include a total ban on such flights. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: The UAE\'s response to SARS is a work </p><p>in progress.  Having initially responded slowly to </p><p>implementing safety procedures for fear of frightening </p><p>businesspeople and tourists, the UAEG might now be </p><p>overreacting.  The public posture is in line with the </p><p>international standards recommended by WHO, but behind </p><p>the scenes, officials are scrambling to implement a </p><p>cohesive program. With regard to the re-routing of the </p><p>Gulf Air flight, we would defer to Embassy Muscat but </p><p>believe the return may have resulted from a decision </p><p>by the Omani Civil Aviation Authorities, who are the </p><p>overseers/regulators of Gulf Air.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
