<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001183 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AFIS AND DRL/IL, NSC FOR SENIOR AF DIRECTOR </p><p>FRAZER, LONDON FOR CGURNEY, PARIS FOR CNEARY, NAIROBI FOR </p><p>PFLAUMER, BRUSSELS FOR USEU:WAGNER, GENEVA FOR HAGEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZCTU\'S BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL AT THE UPCOMING ILO </p><p>CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by KRBel for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) This is an action request -- see paragraph 6. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary.  LABOFF met May 15 with Wellington Chibebe of </p><p>the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).  Chibebe </p><p>expressed concern that the GOZ would use the upcoming ILO </p><p>conference in Geneva as another forum in which to attack the </p><p>legitimacy of his organization.  Chibebe requested assistance </p><p>to enable him to attend the conference along with ZCTU </p><p>President Lovemore Matombo (Matombo\'s travel costs have </p><p>already been covered).  Additionally, Chibebe requested our </p><p>assistance in mobilizing support for ZCTU\'s official delegate </p><p>status should the GOZ attempt to appoint as the "official" </p><p>Zimbabwean labor delegate another labor organization it </p><p>created to counter the ZCTU\'s broad influence.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  In the course of a meeting with Laboff, Wellington </p><p>Chibebe, Secretary General of the ZCTU, stated that he has </p><p>been informed that both ZCTU and the GOZ-sponsored Zimbabwe </p><p>Federation of Trade Unions (ZFTU) would be allowed by the GOZ </p><p>to travel to Geneva for the upcoming ILO congress. The ZFTU </p><p>is a shell organization created by ZANU-PF/GOZ as a more </p><p>controllable counterpart to the legitimate ZCTU.  The ZFTU </p><p>has used strong-arm tactics against employers to convince </p><p>workers to join up, but thus far the only group with </p><p>widescale membership in the ZFTU is the sugar plantation </p><p>workers.  Within that industry, the GOZ has reportedly </p><p>pressured the employers while the ZFTU has coerced the </p><p>workers, with the result being a mass shift of workers\' </p><p>allegiance (as well as their membership dues) from the </p><p>ZCTU-affiliated sugar workers\' union to the ZFTU. While the </p><p>true size of the organization as well as its leadership is </p><p>unclear, "war vet" Joseph Chinotimba, self-proclaimed </p><p>commander of the farm invasions and ZANU-PF\'s chief worker </p><p>bee and enforcer, is the ZFTU\'s vice president. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The GOZ has not yet indicated which organization will </p><p>receive government appointment as the official Zimbabwean </p><p>delegation, and Chibebe believes that the GOZ may postpone </p><p>announcing its intentions until the last possible minute. </p><p>Chibebe\'s concern is that the GOZ may well appoint the ZFTU </p><p>as the official delegation while relegating the ZCTU to an </p><p>"advisory" role.  If this happens, the ZCTU will dispute the </p><p>appointment and the matter will go to the ILO Accreditation </p><p>Committee, which is chaired by Benin.  Chibebe is concerned </p><p>that politics may win the day and that ZFTU may prevail in an </p><p>accreditation fight.  Late reports on May 17 indicate that </p><p>the GOZ intends to invite both ZCTU and ZFTU to the Geneva </p><p>meeting as if they had equal status. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Post is already investigating possible means of </p><p>sponsoring Chibebe to attend the conference along with ZCTU </p><p>president Lovemore Matombo, whose attendance has already been </p><p>funded by other sponsors.  However, ZCTU is under severe </p><p>financial pressure and does not have the money to send </p><p>Chibebe outright.  Chibebe can offer vital assistance by </p><p>lobbying for support for the ZCTU among the other delegates, </p><p>in the event that such a showdown develops.  Further, even if </p><p>such a struggle does not develop, Chibebe\'s attendance will </p><p>enhance his international profile and confirm the USG\'s </p><p>support for the ZCTU. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Action requested:  Post recommends that Solidarity </p><p>Center be contacted to sponsor Chibebe\'s travel to the ILO </p><p>meeting.  Post also recommends that the Department and/or DOL </p><p>approach other international labor groupings and delegates to </p><p>solicit their support that the ZCTU be recognized as </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s official delegation.  In addition to weighing in </p><p>with the ICFTU, it will be important to address our concerns </p><p>to other national and regional labor organizations.  As </p><p>Chibebe noted, Mugabe is willing to play the "race card" </p><p>without compunction, and pressure from a western labor group </p><p>alone could play into Mugabe\'s "African unity" rhetoric. </p><p>Other groups which could be approached include WCL, SATUCC, </p><p>ICFTU-Afro, OAUTU (Organization of African Unity Trade </p><p>Unions), and COSATU (Congress of South African Trade Unions). </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Suggested talking points: </p><p> </p><p>-- We understand the GOZ may be planning to accredit the </p><p>ZFTU, an organization created by and controlled by the </p><p>Zimbabwean government and  ZANU-PF, at the upcoming </p><p>International Labor Congress.  This would relegate the ZCTU, </p><p>the ILO-accredited representative of Zimbabwean labor, an </p><p>affiliate of the ICFTU and the legitimate representative of </p><p>the vast majority of Zimbabwean workers, to an "advisory" </p><p>role. </p><p> </p><p>-- Such an outcome would be a violation of the principles of </p><p>democratically free trade unionism which the ILO supports. </p><p> </p><p>-- Such an action would also indicate the desire of the </p><p>Zimbabwean government to bring the Zimbabwean labor movement </p><p>under government/party control and to impose political </p><p>retribution on the ZCTU and its members for allegedly </p><p>opposing Mugabe and Zanu-PF in the recent flawed presidential </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>-- The USG supports the ZCTU\'s effort to retain its </p><p>legitimate seat in the International Labor Congress and to </p><p>reject efforts to designate a government-puppet labor </p><p>organization as a labor federation with full ILO recognition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- We urge the ICFTU (or insert appropriate other </p><p>organization) to back official accreditation of the ZCTU in </p><p>the ILO as well and to urge its affiliates to stand behind </p><p>the ZCTU as the legitimate representation of organized labor </p><p>in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>End suggested points. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
