<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 003213 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: SHAYKH SABAH OPENS NATIONAL ASSEMBLY; GOK FOCUSED </p><p>ON ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) In a brief July 19 speech on behalf of the Amir </p><p>opening the inaugural session of the tenth National Assembly, </p><p>newly appointed Kuwaiti Prime Minister Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmed </p><p>al-Sabah offered an olive branch to the new parliament and </p><p>laid out his government\'s priorities.  He began by stressing </p><p>the need for cooperation to confront the challenges offered </p><p>by recent events in the region and professed the government\'s </p><p>readiness to work with the National Assembly on economic </p><p>reform and constructing a base for "true democracy." He </p><p>welcomed differences of opinion and constructive criticism, </p><p>which he saw as furthering Kuwait\'s development as a state </p><p>based on institutions.  Finally, before enumerating the </p><p>government\'s priorities, he stressed that they were open for </p><p>discussion and should be set in consultation with the Kuwaiti </p><p>people. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Without going into any specifics, Shaykh Sabah then </p><p>mentioned the following priorities, in order from highest to </p><p>lowest: </p><p> </p><p>-- ensuring the safety and security of the country; </p><p>-- mobilizing youth to invigorate the economy; </p><p>-- developing further the oil sector; </p><p>-- confronting demographical factors; </p><p>-- improving the utilization of the work force through </p><p>increased employment opportunities; </p><p>-- continuing administrative reform; </p><p>-- providing adequate housing; </p><p>-- improving the general level of education; </p><p>-- expanding and broadening health services; </p><p>-- protecting the environment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) On the conclusion of the speech the session adjourned </p><p>for a few minutes to allow the diplomatic corps and other </p><p>dignitaries to clear the gallery before the National Assembly </p><p>began its work.  The first order of business was to elect its </p><p>leadership, there was then to be a debate of the Amir\'s </p><p>speech and consideration of a new law on the municipal </p><p>council left over from the previous session.  It was not </p><p>clear whether this work could be completed in one day or </p><p>whether it would extend over the next day or two.  At its </p><p>conclusion, the National Assembly will adjourn for the summer </p><p>holidays until mid-October. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: Although completely lacking in specifics, </p><p>one can read between the lines of the speech to conclude that </p><p>the GOK will likely focus more on economic than on political </p><p>reform, at least at the outset of the new parliamentary </p><p>session.  Fully six of the government\'s priorities are </p><p>designed to confront the same problem: how to integrate the </p><p>country\'s rising generation of young people productively into </p><p>national economic life.  Sixty percent of the population is </p><p>now less than 25 years of age and 93 percent of the Kuwaiti </p><p>workforce is already employed in the public sector one way or </p><p>another.  In order to provide jobs for the next generation </p><p>there is no alternative to expanding opportunities in the </p><p>private sector.  If the government can persuade the National </p><p>Assembly of this reality it will make it much more easy to </p><p>promote reform.  The goal clearly is to convince its critics </p><p>that it is undertaking reform for the sake of Kuwait rather </p><p>than as a response to international pressure. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
