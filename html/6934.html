(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) COM convened Abu Dhabi\'s Iraq Task Force/core </p><p>Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, 3/29. </p><p>Embassy Abu Dhabi, FCS (located outside of the Embassy </p><p>compound), and the USGS office in Al Ain are open 3/29 with </p><p>full staffing. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) ORCA reported no new developments on the threat </p><p>posed by the Iraqi Intelligence Services (IIS) outlined in </p><p>ref B.  A four-person Iraqi cell is believed to be in </p><p>country but the members, who might have entered the country </p><p>under aliases, have not been located. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF) UAE security forces have worked closely with the </p><p>Embassy to respond to the threats. RSO met with the Abu </p><p>Dhabi police chief on 3/29. The police have agreed to </p><p>increase visible uniformed security at several Mission </p><p>residences as well as increase patrols in the locations of </p><p>other Embassy residences.  The police have also agreed to </p><p>increase uniformed officers at the American School and the </p><p>new Embassy compound. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF) FBI reported a vague, new threat in the UAE </p><p>originating from Somalia and targeting official Americans </p><p>and businesses.  The credibility of the threat is currently </p><p>unclear. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF) USLO confirmed that U.S. military forces in the </p><p>UAE are on Force Protection Condition Delta in response to </p><p>the IIS security threat.  Al-Dhafra airbase reported what </p><p>are believed to be false positives for bubonic plague on </p><p>3/28. The base was alerted to the possible airborne threat </p><p>by the Portal Shield Device which has been installed for </p><p>some time. Definitive confirmation is pending the testing </p><p>of samples sent to Bahrain.  The UAEG has not been told of </p><p>the incident. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) RSO noted there was a large, peaceful demonstration </p><p>in Dubai on 3/28, but that so far, there have been no </p><p>demonstrations in Abu Dhabi. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>UAEG Actions/Statements </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.   (C) The UAEG will be shipping 2000 tons of food to </p><p>Iraq in the next few days. ECON will meet with the Red </p><p>Crescent Society on 3/29 to offer assistance in </p><p>coordinating humanitarian relief programs. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Consular/American Citizen Services </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The Consular Section received a few phone calls </p><p>from wardens asking about the Dubai demonstrations. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Local Media </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) PAO reported that Abu Dhabi-controlled media (ADTV </p><p>and Al Ittihad newspaper) are trying to keep a lid on </p><p>public opinion by offering more balanced and moderate </p><p>coverage of the war.  Privately owned newspapers continue </p><p>to carry strident reporting and are selling more copies </p><p>than Al Ittihad.  Al Khaleej newspaper often uses the word </p><p>"massacre" in major headlines describing Iraqi civilian </p><p>casualties. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) The Abu Dhabi-based Zayed Center for Coordination </p><p>and Follow-up, affiliated with the Arab League, published a </p><p>study reporting that the quest for oil and global </p><p>domination are the motivations behind this war. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) On Wednesday, 4/2, the Northern Emirate of Sharjah </p><p>will hold a festival to be attended by the Sharjah ruler\'s </p><p>wife in support of the Iraqi people. </p><p>13.
