On </p><p>the other hand, he rented his factory in </p><p>Kiziltepe, Mardin to the American army.  Duyan`s </p><p>reply to the criticism regarding the issue was </p><p>that he had rented a factory that belonged to </p><p>him, which is not of interest to anyone and it is </p><p>not a contradiction, it is only trade.  It is </p><p>reported that security forces prevented an </p><p>American military attachQ to enter the region. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
