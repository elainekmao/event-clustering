(C) IN INTRODUCING CONSUL TO DOMINIC BARTSCH, UNHCR </p><p>SENIOR DURABLE SOLUTIONS OFFICER (THE UN OFFICER </p><p>REPLACING ATTORNEY MICHIEL SALOMONS), UNHCR REGIONAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OLUSEYI BAJULAIYE SAID THAT MOVEMENT ON </p><p>THE RELEASE OF THE CUBAN DOCTORS HAD GROUND TO A HALT. </p><p>HE TOLD US THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO PROGRESS EITHER BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE OR UNHCR IN FINDING A SOLUTION TO </p><p>THE CASE OF CUBAN DOCTORS LEONEL CORDOVA RODRIGUEZ AND </p><p>NORIS DEL CARMEN PENA MARTINEZ.  BAJULAIYE SAID THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAD INFORMED HIM THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE IS "MUCH TOO BUSY" TO MAKE A DECISION </p><p>REGARDING THE CUBANS.  INDEED, WE CAN AVER THAT MUGABE </p><p>HAS BEEN CONSUMED WITH DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH AND </p><p>PUTTING TOGETHER A CABINET FOLLOWING THE RECENT </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IN WHICH HIS PARTY NARROWLY WON A </p><p>MAJORITY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) BAJULAIYE REPORTED TO CONSUL THAT THE LETTER HE </p><p>HAD DRAFTED FOR MRS. OGATA TO SEND TO PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03563  01 OF 02  291610Z </p><p>WAS STILL ON THE DESK OF THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR </p><p>REFUGEES.  HE OPINED THAT THE HIGH COMMISSIONER MAY BE </p><p>WAITING FOR THE RETURN TO GENEVA OF DEPUTY HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER SOREN JESSEN-PETERSEN, WITH WHOM SHE WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO CONSULT PRIOR TO TAKING ANY ACTION.  JESSEN- </p><p>PETERSEN\'S LETTER TO VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA REMAINS </p><p>UNANSWERED, ACCORDING TO THE REGIONAL UNHCR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE.  BAJULAIYE ALSO REVEALED THAT DOCTORS </p><p>CORDOVA AND PENA HAD WRITTEN LETTERS TO THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN WHICH THEY PLEADED FOR THE RIGHT TO BE </p><p>RESETTLED IN ONE OF TWO COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ACCEPTED </p><p>THEM AS REFUGEES.  THE UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT </p><p>NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, HE WOULD RETURN TO LUSAKA ON </p><p>SATURDAY, JULY 1, AND THAT BARTSCH WOULD BE LEAVING ON </p><p>SUNDAY, JULY 2.  THE CASE WOULD THEN PASS INTO THE HANDS </p><p>OF LOCAL UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE JOHN ADU, WHO WILL BE </p><p>RETURNING AFTER A VACATION FROM LONDON ON JULY 2. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CONSUL GAVE TWO TOILETRY KITS TO BAJULAIYE TO </p><p>DELIVER TO THE CUBAN DOCTORS.  SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS </p><p>COMMITTEE STAFF MEMBER G. GARRETT GRIBSBY BROUGHT THE </p><p>KITS, BUT WAS UNABLE TO HAND THEM OVER PERSONALLY, </p><p>HAVING BEEN DENIED ACCESS TO THE DOCTORS.  THE REGIONAL </p><p>UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE REPORTED THAT HIS STAFF HAD </p><p>DELIVERED THE KITS TO THE DESPONDENT CUBANS ON JUNE 29. </p><p>A FRUSTRATED BAJULAIYE SAID THAT HE WOULD SPEAK ONE MORE </p><p>TIME TO THE PERMANENT SECRETARIES OF THE MINISTRIES OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND HOME AFFAIRS AS WELL AS THE CHIEF OF </p><p>IMMIGRATION TO INFORM THEM OF HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO </p><p>LUSAKA BECAUSE OF LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE CASE.  HE </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT LEGAL INTERVENTION (NOT BY UNHCR) MAY BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03563  01 OF 02  291610Z </p><p>A FINAL OPTION TO SECURE THE RELEASE OF THE CUBANS, AS </p><p>IT WAS "ILLEGAL" FOR THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO KEEP THEM IN JAIL WHEN THEY HAD COMMITTED NO </p><p>CRIME IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SWEDISH AMBASSADOR LENNARTH HJELMAKER TOLD DCM </p><p>ON JUNE 29 THAT SWEDEN IS PREPARED TO HELP RESETTLE THE </p><p>CUBANS, BUT AT PRESENT IS UNSURE OF WHAT HIS COUNTRY\'S </p><p>ROLE IN THE CASE SHOULD BE. THE SWEDES ARE OCCASIONALLY </p><p>IN TOUCH WITH UNHCR IN HARARE, BUT HAVE NOT HEARD FROM </p><p>THEM IN OVER A WEEK.  THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR SPECULATED </p><p>THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS SUSPECT THAT SWEDEN IS MERELY AN </p><p>ENTREPOT FROM WHICH THE CUBAN DOCTORS WILL PROCEED </p><p>DIRECTLY TO THE UNITED STATES.  HE CONTINUED THAT HE HAD </p><p>NOT DISCUSSED THE CASE WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p>SWEDEN HAD BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S USE </p><p>OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION IN THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION CAMPAIGN, A REASON THE SWEDISH </p><p>AMBASSADOR SPECULATED THE FORMER WOULD NOT WANT SWEDEN </p><p>TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.  CANADIAN DEPUTY HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER RON WILLSON TOLD DCM ON JUNE 29 THAT CANADA </p><p>STANDS READY TO RECEIVE THE CUBANS, BUT REMARKED THAT </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT HAD NOT BEEN APPROACHED SINCE INITIAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS BY UNHCR IN THIS CONNECTION SOME THREE WEEKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2489 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03563  02 OF 02  291610Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-01 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------688402  291610Z /38 </p><p>O 291614Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6478 </p><p>INFO USINT HAVANA PRIORITY </p><p>COMMISSIONER USINS WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003563 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM A/S TAFT, PRM/A, PRM/AAA, AF/S, AF/PD, </p><p>WHA/CCA </p><p>NAIROBI FOR REFCOORD AND INS </p><p>ROME FOR INS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03563  02 OF 02  291610Z </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/29/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, ZI, CU </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO DEFER </p><p>RELEASE OF CUBAN DOCTORS </p><p> </p><p>AGO.
