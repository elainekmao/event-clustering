FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EUR/OHI (AMBASSADOR BINDENAGEL) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: FR, GM, IT, KNAR, PHUM, PREL, SOCI, GM, IT, KNAR, PHUM, PREL, SOCI, VT, VTFR </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLOCAUST ENVOY\'S VATICAN FAREWELL CALL </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 VATICAN 06619 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON.  REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.    (C) SUMMARY:  U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR HOLOCAUST ISSUES </p><p>AMBASSADOR BINDENAGEL MET WITH VATICAN OFFICIALS APRIL 26 FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02229  01 OF 02  081737Z </p><p>A LAST UPDATE ON THE ISSUE OF ACCESS TO PONTIFICAL ARCHIVES </p><p>FOR RESEARCH RELATED TO THE SHOAH AND THE PONTIFICATE OF PIUS </p><p>XII. HE MET SEPARATELY WITH VATICAN DFM MSGR. MIGLIORE AND </p><p>CARDINAL KASPAR, HEAD OF THE VATICAN\'S COMMISSION FOR </p><p>RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM.  BOTH NOTED GRADUAL </p><p>HEADWAY, YET ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE SETBACK OF THE 2001 </p><p>BREAKDOWN OF THE JEWISH-VATICAN COMMISSION TO STUDY PIUS </p><p>XII\'S WWII ROLE. KASPAR NARRATED HIS EFFORTS TO FOUND A NEW </p><p>COMMISSION BASED ON COLLABORATION BETWEEN ACADEMIC </p><p>INSTITUTIONS THAT WOULD MARGINALIZE INVOLVEMENT BY THE </p><p>VATICAN AND THE WORLD JEWISH CONGRESS. KASPAR AND MIGLIORE </p><p>DENOUNCED A RESURGENT ANTI-SEMITISM, NURTURED IN THEIR </p><p>OPINION BY THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS, AND ALSO VOICED CONCERN AT </p><p>THE APRIL 21 FRENCH ELECTION RESULTS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) AMBASSADOR J.D. BINDENAGEL, SPECIAL ENVOY FOR </p><p>HOLOCAUST ISSUES, MET SEPARATELY APRIL 26 AT THE VATICAN WITH </p><p>DFM CELESTINO MIGLIORE AND CARDINAL WALTAR KASPAR, HEAD OF </p><p>THE COMMISION FOR RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM. POLOFF </p><p>ATTENDED BOTH MEETINGS AS NOTETAKER; MSGR. FUMAGELLI </p><p>ACCOMPANIED CARDINAL KASPAR. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CARDINAL KASPAR NOTED THAT THE ACTS OF THE BERLIN </p><p>NUNCIATURE UP TO 1939, COVERING THE REIGN OF PIUS XI, WOULD </p><p>BE ACCESSIBLE IN 2003. ALTHOUGH THESE WOULD NOT INCLUDE </p><p>DOCUMENTS FROM THE PAPACY OF PIUS XII, THEY HAVE SPECIAL </p><p>RELEVANCE GIVEN THE ROLE OF EUGENIO PACELLI, THE FUTURE PIUS </p><p>XII, AS NUNCIO IN BERLIN AND LATER SECRETARY OF STATE UNDER </p><p>PIUS XI.  YET KASPAR STATED HE WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE THE </p><p>TIMETABLE FOR OPENING THE VATICAN ARCHIVES FOR THE REIGN OF </p><p>PIUS XII, CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED ABOUT 2010 (REF).  NOT ONLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02229  01 OF 02  081737Z </p><p>WERE THOSE ARCHIVES IN EXTREME DISORDER -- A "DURCHEINANDER" </p><p>HE DECLARED IN GERMAN -- AND IN NEED OF PAINSTAKING REVIEW, </p><p>BUT THESE ARCHIVES WERE THE DOMAIN OF THE VATICAN SECRETARIAT </p><p>AND NOT THE COUNCIL FOR RELATIONS WITH THE JEWS.  HE REMARKED </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT HOLDS NO FEAR OF THE HISTORICAL VERDICT, </p><p>HOWEVER WORK MUST PROCEED METHODICALLY. KASPAR COMMENTED THAT </p><p>SINCE HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION ENTAILED MAKING JUDGMENTS AND </p><p>NOT SIMPLY ASCERTAINING FACTS, THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE SOME </p><p>DISAGREEMENT.  EARLIER MIGLIORE, TOO, HAD SPOKEN SIMILARLY, </p><p>OPINING THAT IDEOLOGICAL CONCERNS WERE GUIDING MANY </p><p>RESEARCHERS.  MIGLIORE DECRIED THE RECENT COSTA-GRAVAS FILM </p><p>"AMEN" FOR ITS LACK OF CONCERN FOR HISTORICAL TRUTH. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  KASPAR LAMENTED THE 2001 BREAKDOWN OF THE </p><p>JEWISH-VATICAN COMMISSION ESTABLISHED IN 1999 TO ASSESS THE </p><p>12 VOLUME SET OF HOLY SEE ARCHIVAL MATERIALS RELATING TO THE </p><p>WWII PAPACY OF PIUS XII AND THE HOLOCAUST. THAT COMMISSION </p><p>LOOKED GOOD ON PAPER, HE STATED, YET ITS EXECUTION WAS DEEPLY </p><p>FLAWED, CITING THE LACK OF SHARED CRITERIA, THE WANT OF </p><p>MUTUAL TRUST, AND THE UNHELPFUL RECOURSE BY INDIVIDUAL </p><p>PARTICIPANTS TO THE MEDIA.  HE ALSO FAULTED THE COMMISSION </p><p>FOR ITS FAILURE TO INCLUDE A EUROPEAN HISTORIAN, GIVEN THAT </p><p>THE HOLOCAUST WAS FUNDAMENTALLY A EUROPEAN AFFAIR. KASPAR </p><p>DISAVOWED ANY BLAME FOR THE BREAKDOWN, BUT EMPHASIZED THE </p><p>COMMISSION WAS FRAGILE FROM THE START.  KASPAR HAS SINCE </p><p>SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A NEW COMMISSION THAT WOULD PROCEED ON AN </p><p>ACADEMIC PLANE, AS A COOPERATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN TEL AVIV AND </p><p>FRANKFURT UNIVERSITIES, IN PLACE OF THE PREVIOUS </p><p>VATICAN-WORLD JEWISH CONGRESS DRIVEN COMMISSION.  HIS PROJECT </p><p>FOUNDERED, ACCORDING TO KASPAR, WHEN TEL AVIV SOUGHT NEW </p><p>CONDITIONS BEYOND KASPAR\'S AUTHORIZATION, MOST NOTABLY THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02229  01 OF 02  081737Z </p><p>INCLUSION OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, ALLEGEDLY DUE TO PRESSURE </p><p>BY TEL AVIV\'S U.S. FINANCIAL BACKERS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) BOTH KASPAR AND MIGLIORE DECRIED THE APRIL 21 </p><p>ELECTORAL SUCCESS OF FRENCH NATIONAL LEADER JEAN-MARIE LE </p><p>PEN, A REPUTED ANTI-SEMITE. KASPAR, IN PARTICULAR, REPEATEDLY </p><p>DECLARED HIS REVULSION, AND DELIVERED AN IMPASSIONED </p><p>DENUNCIATION OF ANTI-SEMITISM, IN WHICH HE REITERATED THE </p><p>CENTRALITY OF JUDAISM TO CHRISTIANITY  -- "OUR ELDER BROTHER </p><p>IN THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM" IN THE WORDS OF JOHN PAUL II -- AND </p><p>OF JUDAISM TO EUROPEAN CULTURE. "WITHOUT JUDAISM YOU CANNOT </p><p>EVEN SPEAK OF CULTURE IN BERLIN AND VIENNA," KASPAR REMARKED, </p><p>ADDED THAT IN HIS YOUTH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN ABSORBED BY THE </p><p>THOUGHT OF JEWISH PHILOSOPHER MARTIN BUBER. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  MIGLIORE LINKED RESURGENT EUROPEAN ANTI-SEMITISM TO </p><p>FALLOUT FROM DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, A VIEW KASPAR </p><p>SHARED IN PRINCIPLE, ALTHOUGH THE CARDINAL TOOK EXPLICIT CARE </p><p>TO CONDEMN PALESTINIAN HOMICIDAL BOMBERS AS WELL AS ISRAELI </p><p>ACTIONS IN BETHLEHEM. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: DFM MIGLIORE\'S REMARKS REVEAL THAT THE </p><p>VATICAN MFA NOW VIEWS THE ARCHIVAL DISPUTE AS A QUESTION OF </p><p>SECONDARY IMPORTANCE, A NUISANCE THAT PALES IN RELATION TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0439 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  02229  02 OF 02  081738Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      PERC-00  DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      CAEX-01  SSO-00   SS-00    EPAE-00  DSCC-00  LBA-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------ABCD2C  081739Z /38 </p><p>O 081227Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO ARAB ISRAELI COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 002229 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y (SUBJECT) </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

CARDINAL </p><p>KASPAR, ON THE OTHER HAND, SEEMED MORE AT EASE WITH THE </p><p>SUBJECT, WHICH HE VIEWS IN THE CONTEXT OF A COMMITMENT TO </p><p>JEWISH-CHRISTIAN RECONCILIATION.  KASPAR BELIEVES THE VATICAN </p><p>HAS TAKEN IMPORTANT AND IRREVERSIBLE STEPS FORWARD TO DEFUSE </p><p>THE ARCHIVAL DISPUTE, YET HE IS EVIDENTLY DISAPPOINTED AT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02229  02 OF 02  081738Z </p><p>PERCEIVED LACK OF RECIPROCAL GESTURES; HE APPEALED </p><p>CONTINUALLY FOR THE NEED FOR MUTUAL TRUST IN ORDER TO ADVANCE </p><p>FURTHER.  KASPAR, WHO BRIEFLY TAUGHT IN THE U.S. AS A GUEST </p><p>PROFESSOR, WAS PLEASED TO LEARN MORE OF USG INITIATIVES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY ON HOLOCAUST COMPENSATION; THE CHANCE TO </p><p>CONVERSE IN HIS NATIVE GERMAN ALSO APPEARED TO ELICIT A MORE </p><p>AMIABLE ATTITUDE REGARDING A TOPIC THAT GENERALLY HAS THE </p><p>VATICAN IMMEDIATELY ON THE DEFENSIVE. </p><p> </p><p>8.
