<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PARIS 011204 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/15/2011 </p><p>TAGS: AF, FR, PK, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: FRENCH VIEWS OF AFGHANISTAN\'S POLITICAL FUTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 176819 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR SHARON WIENER </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  WE DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS TO FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>VEDRINE\'S OFFICE AND TO MFA AFGHAN DESK OFFICER BRUCE BOURDON </p><p>ON OCTOBER 11 AND FOLLOWED-UP WITH A MEETING WITH BOURDON ON </p><p>OCTOBER 12.  BOURDON TOLD US THAT THE FRENCH WERE ENGAGED IN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR EU PARTNERS REGARDING AFGHANISTAN\'S </p><p>POLITICAL FUTURE.  HE NOTED THESE DISCUSSIONS HAD BEEN </p><p>STIMULATED IN PART BY FOREIGN MINISTER HUBERT VEDRINE\'S </p><p>"ACTION PLAN FOR AFGHANISTAN".  HOWEVER, HE ADDED THAT THE </p><p>FRENCH HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS, </p><p>DOCUMENTS, OR PROPOSALS ABOUT WHERE TO GO NEXT IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>FROM THEIR EU PARTNERS.  BOURDON SAID THIS LACK OF RESPONSE </p><p>WAS PROBABLY DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS: INSUFFICIENT TIME TO </p><p>RESPOND, UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE DIRECTION THE WAR IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN WOULD TAKE, AND, THE CURRENT HEAVY TRAVEL </p><p>SCHEDULE OF SENIOR MFA OFFICIALS.  BOURDON NOTED VEDRINE WAS </p><p>VISITING ROME WHERE HE WILL BE MEETING WITH FORMER KING </p><p>MOHAMMED ZAHIR SHAH, WHILE THE MFA\'S DIRECTOR FOR ASIA, </p><p>DOMINIQUE GIRARD, IS VISITING WASHINGTON.  TONGUE IN CHEEK, </p><p>BOURDON COMMENTED THAT GIVEN GIRARD\'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON, IT </p><p>WAS LIKELY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT FRANCE\'S </p><p>POSITION ON AFGHANISTAN THAN HE WOULD.  BOURDON, HOWEVER, </p><p>MADE CLEAR THAT IN TRYING TO DEVELOP A POSITION ON </p><p>AFGHANISTAN\'S POLITICAL FUTURE, FRANCE WAS PAYING PARTICULAR </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE OPINIONS OF THE GERMANS, BRITISH, AND </p><p>ITALIANS.  THE FRENCH WILL LISTEN POLITELY TO OTHER EU </p><p>MEMBERS, BUT IT IS THOSE THREE COUNTRIES WHO ARE MOST </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE CRISIS AND CONTRIBUTING THE MOST FINANCIALLY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  BOURDON SAID HE DID NOT EXPECT ANYONE TO BE ABLE TO </p><p>DEVELOP A COHERENT POSITION UNTIL THE COURSE OF THE WAR IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN BECAME A BIT CLEARER.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE </p><p>FRENCH WERE WATCHING DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY TO SEE WHETHER THE </p><p>TALIBAN COLLAPSED OR IF THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HANG ON TO </p><p>POWER FOR SOME TIME.  WHILE THE FRENCH HOPE FOR A QUICK </p><p>COLLAPSE AND A RAPID CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES, THERE IS SOME </p><p>CONCERN THAT IN A WORST CASE, THE CONFLICT COULD DRAG ON </p><p>THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR AND WELL INTO 2002.  BOURDON </p><p>NOTED THE FRENCH WERE ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON PAKISTANI </p><p>BEHAVIOR TOWARDS AFGHANISTAN AND THE TALIBAN.  HE EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT THE FRENCH WERE UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>PAKISTAN WOULD ALLOW THE TALIBAN TO CRUMBLE, OR WHETHER THE </p><p>GOP, OR A ROGUE ELEMENT OF THE GOP, WOULD FIND SOME MEANS TO </p><p>PROVIDE COVERT SUPPORT TO THE TALIBAN.  UNSURE ABOUT WHAT </p><p>COMES NEXT, THE FRENCH NEVERTHELESS BELIEVE THE GOP NEEDS TO </p><p>BE INVOLVED IN DECISIONS RELATING TO AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE AND </p><p>THAT IT IS CRUCIAL TO FIND AFGHAN PASHTUNS WHO CAN PLAY A </p><p>PROMINENT ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  BOURDON SAID THE FRENCH BELIEVED FORMER KING </p><p>MOHAMMED ZAHIR SHAH WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO PLAY A VERY LIMITED </p><p>ROLE.  HE MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE IMPETUS TO START A </p><p>DIALOGUE, LOYA JIRGA, BUT HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THINGS </p><p>HIMSELF.  THE FRENCH ALSO BELIEVE WE, WESTERN COUNTRIES, </p><p>SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO NOT TRY TO IMPOSE ANY DECISIONS FROM THE </p><p>OUTSIDE.  THERE MIGHT BE A SMALL SUPERVISORY ROLE FOR THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS, BUT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY EFFORT TO DEPLOY </p><p>A LARGER-SCALE UN MISSION A LA KOSOVO OR EAST TIMOR.  A LARGE </p><p>UN MISSION SIMPLY WOULD NOT WORK AND IT WOULD QUICKLY BECOME </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVIDE ANY KIND OF SECURITY FOR A LARGE UN </p><p>MISSION.  THE FRENCH SEE THE UN\'S ROLE AS MINIMAL, SIMPLY </p><p>BEING A PRESENCE TO URGE FOLLOW-UP TO DECISIONS MADE BY </p><p>AFGHANS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  WHEN ASKED ABOUT VEDRINE\'S OCTOBER 10 MEETING WITH </p><p>LAKHDAR BRAHIMI, BOURDON (PLEASE PROTECT) REPLIED THAT </p><p>VEDRINE WAS "UP TO HIS USUAL TRICKS".  HE EXPLAINED THE </p><p>VEDRINE-BRAHIMI MEETING HAD BEEN A "TETE-A-TETE" AND VEDRINE </p><p>DID NOT BOTHER TO BRIEF ANYONE IN THE MFA ABOUT THEIR </p><p>CONVERSATION.  BOURDON SAID THE ONLY THING HE KNEW CAME FROM </p><p>ONE OF VEDRINE\'S PROTOCOL OFFICERS WHO ESCORTED BRAHIMI TO </p><p>THE MEETING.  THE PROTOCOL OFFICER SAID BRAHIMI EXPRESSED THE </p><p>VIEW THAT PAKISTAN WOULD NEED TO PLAY A ROLE IN REACHING AN </p><p>AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND ZAHIR SHAH\'S </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  BRAHIMI ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY </p><p>FOR THE PERSONNEL OF UN AGENCIES AND NGOS AFTER THE "U.S. </p><p>DOES ITS JOB".  BRAHIMI SAID HE SAW NO WAY TO PREVENT </p><p>INSTABILITY AND HAD NO SUGGESTIONS REGARDING HOW TO CHANGE </p><p>THIS.  A MEMBER OF FM VEDRINE\'S STAFF ADDED THAT BRAHIMI TOLD </p><p>VEDRINE THAT HE WAS APPROCHING HIS NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WITH </p><p>"NO PRECONCEPTIONS." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LEACH </p><p></p></div>
