<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 002256 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/RA, NEA/ARP, EB/CBA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 05/10/08 </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, BBSR, ECON, ETRD, EINV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAEG LAYS OUT SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR IRAQ </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Charge D\'Affaires Richard A. Albright </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: UAE Ministry of Finance </p><p>Assistant Undersecretary for Revenue and Budget Khalid Al- </p><p>Bustani laid out for Econchief 5/6 the UAEG\'s priorities </p><p>for Iraq reconstruction.  A memo he provided highlighted </p><p>three areas -- port and airport management, banking and </p><p>finance, and oil -- in which the UAEG expects local </p><p>companies to provide expertise and project management </p><p>services to Iraq.  The UAEG is eager to get its foot in the </p><p>door of Iraq reconstruction, and is likely to use its </p><p>membership in the informal working group on Iraq </p><p>reconstruction to promote local companies\' participation. </p><p>In fact, the UAE\'s representatives to the informal working </p><p>group represent local institutions with a strong interest </p><p>in the UAE\'s agenda: Central Bank Governor Sultan Al- </p><p>Suweidi and Finance Minister of State Mohammed Khirbash </p><p>speak to the UAE\'s muscle in financial services, and Dubai </p><p>Ports Authority\'s enigmatic chairman Sultan Bin Sulayem </p><p>highlights DPA\'s stellar record of ports management at home </p><p>and abroad.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>Port and Airport Management </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The UAE proposes that local companies be considered </p><p>for the construction and management of three free zones in </p><p>southern, central, and northern Iraq, as well as for the </p><p>management of the major Iraqi airports.  (Note: The UAE has </p><p>12 free trade zones, half of which are in Dubai.  End </p><p>note.)  The memo also suggests that UAE companies could </p><p>reorganize the navigation routes and dredge the channels to </p><p>Umm Qasr using state-of-the-art technology, electronic </p><p>mapping, and positioning equipment.  Dubai Ports Authority </p><p>has offered to provide a customs area and warehousing </p><p>facilities in Jebel Ali specifically for shipment of goods </p><p>to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Banking, Finance, and Insurance </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The UAE Central Bank is prepared to provide </p><p>training to Iraqi Central Bank officials in banking </p><p>operations, banking supervision and examination, treasury </p><p>operations (including reserve management and foreign </p><p>exchange and monetary policy instruments), and in the </p><p>management of a network of ATMs, POS and PC Banking.  The </p><p>UAEG also offers to provide training in anti-money </p><p>laundering detection and investigation -- an area in which </p><p>the UAEG has made tremendous strides since 2000.  The memo </p><p>also suggests that the UAEG repatriate a number of Iraqi </p><p>bankers currently working in the UAE in order to provide </p><p>immediate, experienced human capital to the Iraqi financial </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p>Oil Sector </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In more vague terms, the memo suggests the UAE\'s </p><p>willingness to assist in the reconstruction of the Iraqi </p><p>oil sector, particularly in the areas of exploration, </p><p>refining, processing, distribution and management.  The </p><p>UAEG is cognizant of the sensitivities related to the </p><p>management of the Iraqi oil sector, and probably will wait </p><p>for a clearer picture of governance to emerge before </p><p>offering more specific proposals. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
