<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 005748 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER; PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  11/1/15 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, SY, IS, XF </p><p>SUBJECT:  HAFIZ AL-ASAD: LAST DEFENDER OF ARABS </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  CLASSIFIED BY: </p><p>CHRISTOPHER W.S. ROSS, AMBASSADOR.  REASON: 1.5 (D) . </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY: THE IMAGE OF HAFIZ AL-ASAD AS THE LAST </p><p>LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST ISRAELI ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>"OBLITERATE" THE ARAB IDENTITY IS AN INCREASINGLY </p><p>PREVALENT THEME PUT OUT BY THE SARG, AND WILL ONLY </p><p>INTENSIFY IN THE RUN-UP TO AND AFTERMATH OF THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 16 CELEBRATION OF 25 YEARS OF ASAD\'S RULE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH UNREALISTIC RHETORIC IS PART OF THIS </p><p>IMAGE-BUILDING, ASAD\'S "ARABISM" SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>DISMISSED AS MERELY A PLOY.  GIVEN THE LACK OF </p><p>FORWARD MOVEMENT IN THE SYRIAN TRACK AND GREATER </p><p>SUSPICION OF ISRAELI MOTIVES, WE THINK ASAD WILL </p><p>INCREASINGLY VIEW ANY NEW PEACE PROCESS PROPOSALS </p><p>THROUGH THIS ARAB NATIONALISM OPTIC.  ONE COMPONENT </p><p>OF THIS OPTIC IS THAT ISRAEL IS ULTIMATELY SEEKING </p><p>TO "CORNER" SYRIA, AS IT HAS MANY OTHER ARAB </p><p>PARTIES.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3. ALTHOUGH THE SYRIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS ALWAYS </p><p>SOUGHT TO CREATE FOR HAFIZ AL-ASAD A DOMESTIC AND </p><p>EXTERNAL IMAGE AS AN ARAB -- RATHER THAN STRICTLY A </p><p>SYRIAN -- LEADER, THE HYPING OF ASAD\'S DEFENSE OF </p><p>ARAB RIGHTS HAS INTENSIFIED WITH THE LACK OF </p><p>PROGRESS ON THE SYRIAN TRACK AND ISRAEL\'S GROWING </p><p>RELATIONS WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE ARAB WORLD.  THE </p><p>THEME THAT ISRAEL IS SEEKING TO "OBLITERATE" THE </p><p>ARAB IDENTITY VIA WHAT ASAD CALLS "MIDDLE </p><p>EASTERNISM" IS AN INCREASINGLY COMMON FEATURE OF </p><p>SYRIAN RHETORIC. </p><p> </p><p>4. BUT IT IS NOT JUST RHETORIC.  WE BELIEVE IT </p><p>COLORS HOW ASAD PERCEIVES PROPOSALS MADE IN THE </p><p>SYRIAN TRACK, AND SYRIA\'S STANCE TOWARD THE REST OF </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THIS </p><p>SLEDGEHAMMER-LIKE PUBLIC RELATIONS TOOL WILL COME </p><p>DOWN EVEN HARDER AS SYRIA BEGINS TO CELEBRATE THE </p><p>SILVER ANNIVERSARY OF THE "CORRECTIONIST MOVEMENT," </p><p>ASAD\'S 25 YEARS IN POWER.  THE SYRIAN BA\'TH PARTY </p><p>IS INDEED ONLY A SHELL OF ITS FORMER SELF, BUT ONE </p><p>OF THE FEW FACETS THAT REMAIN IS ITS IDENTITY AS AN </p><p>ARAB -- NOT JUST SYRIAN -- MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. IN THE RUN-UP TO THE NOVEMBER 16 FETING OF THE </p><p>CORRECTIONIST MOVEMENT, ASAD IS BEING EXTOLLED AS </p><p>"THE FIRST ARAB STRUGGLER."  HE IS BEING REFERRED </p><p>TO MORE AS AN ARAB LEADER THAN THE SYRIAN LEADER, </p><p>AND AS THE SUPREME DEFENDER OF ARAB RIGHTS.  ASAD\'S </p><p>ARAB IMAGE PERMEATES ALL EVENTS HERE -- POLITICAL </p><p>OR OTHERWISE.  THE MINISTER OF CULTURE RECENTLY </p><p>OPENED AN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL IN DAMASCUS </p><p>(WHERE AN AWARD-WINNING TUNISIAN FILM WAS EXCLUDED </p><p>BECAUSE ITS DIRECTOR HAD TRAVELLED TO ISRAEL) WITH </p><p>AN EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION FOR PRESIDENT ASAD\'S </p><p>CONCERN FOR THE ROLE OF CINEMA IN ENLIGHTENING THE </p><p>PEOPLE AND GIVING AN IDEA ABOUT THIS COUNTRY WHICH </p><p>IS FACING A FIERCE ENEMY WHO TRIES TO ANNEX MORE </p><p>ARAB LANDS IN DEFIANCE OF UN RESOLUTIONS."  WHETHER </p><p>IT IS THE PREPARATORY MEETING FOR THE UPCOMING EU- </p><p>MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE IN BARCELONA OR THE UN\'S </p><p>WOMEN\'S CONFERENCE IN PEKING, SARG REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>DO NOT MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THAT SYRIA IS </p><p>CARRYING THE ARAB RIGHTS MANTLE, EVEN IF, IN THE </p><p>SARG\'S MIND, OTHER ARABS ARE NOT.  AS THE NOVEMBER </p><p>1 OFFICIAL RADIO COMMENTARY SAID SUBTLY, "WHEN </p><p>SYRIA PLAYS THE ARAB TUNE, THE ARAB MASSES REPEAT </p><p>IT AFTER HER." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>ASAD MISREADS THE ISRAELIS -- BUT DOES HE CARE? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6. IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT ASAD MISREADS THE ISRAELI </p><p>POLITICAL EQUATION.  SARG KNOWLEDGE OF ISRAELI </p><p>DOMESTIC POLITICAL DYNAMICS IS INDEED INADEQUATE. </p><p>BUT THAT IS NOT THE REAL POINT.  EVEN IF THE SARG </p><p>HAD PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THESE DYNAMICS, IT WOULD </p><p>NOT ACT DIFFERENTLY, BECAUSE OF ITS OWN SELF- </p><p>IMPOSED PSYCHOLOGICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS. </p><p>ASAD WILL DO A DEAL IF IT IS EVIDENTLY A GOOD DEAL </p><p>FOR SYRIA, AND HE WILL NOT DO A DEAL IF IT IS NOT - </p><p>- REGARDLESS OF WHETHER RABIN FALLS AND ASAD IS </p><p>FORCED TO DEAL WITH A LESS FLEXIBLE LIKUD </p><p>LEADERSHIP, OR IF THE PROCESS IS SENT INTO THE DEEP </p><p>FREEZE WITH NO PROSPECT FOR THAWING.  A RECENT INR </p><p>ANALYSIS FOR THE SECRETARY ACCURATELY SUMMARIZED </p><p>MANY OF ASAD\'S PEACE PROCESS-RELATED VIEWS AS </p><p>"UNRECONSTRUCTED."  BUT THE MOST RELEVANT POINT IS </p><p>THAT ASAD SEEMS PERFECTLY HAPPY -- AND INDEED </p><p>PREFERS -- TO LIVE IN THAT UNRECONSTRUCTED WORLD. </p><p>IT REQUIRES LESS CHANGE ON HIS PART. </p><p> </p><p>7. ALTHOUGH SYRIANS WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS </p><p>"CONCERN" AND NOT "FEAR" WHICH DRIVES THEIR VIEWS </p><p>OF ISRAELI MOVES, THE OBJECT OF SUCH FEELINGS IS </p><p>THE SAME: THE BELIEF THAT, IN THE WORDS OF AN </p><p>OCTOBER 31 OFFICIAL RADIO COMMENTARY, ISRAEL IS </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO "CORNER" SYRIA AS IT HAS DONE ITS </p><p>OTHER ARAB NEGOTIATING PARTNERS (EXCLUDING THE </p><p>LEBANESE), AND EVEN SOME OTHER ARAB STATES WHICH </p><p>HAVE COMPROMISED ON THE ARAB BOYCOTT AND OPENED NEW </p><p>AVENUES FOR GOI POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTACTS. </p><p>(COMMENT: EVEN PARANOIDS HAVE ENEMIES.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>MORE FODDER FOR ASAD\'S "SPINMEISTERS" </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. ASAD IMAGE BUILDERS HAVE NOT NEEDED THE UPCOMING </p><p>CORRECTIONIST MOVEMENT ANNIVERSARY TO PROVIDE THE </p><p>BACKGROUND FOR THEIR WORK.  EVEN BEFORE THE </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL VOTE ON MOVING OUR EMBASSY TO </p><p>JERUSALEM, TWO REGIONAL EVENTS GAVE THEM AMPLE </p><p>OCCASIONS: THE AMMAN ECONOMIC SUMMIT AND QADHAFI\'S </p><p>EXPULSION OF THE PALESTINIANS.  THE FORMER PROVIDED </p><p>THE PLATFORM FOR SYRIAN CRITICISM OF PREMATURE </p><p>NORMALIZATION.  EGYPTIAN FM \'AMR MUSA\'S REPORTED </p><p>CRITICISM OF SOME PARTIES\' "RUSH" TO NORMALIZE </p><p>HELPED ASAD MORE THAN IT DID MUBARAK BY ECHOING </p><p>ASAD\'S LINE IN A MILDER FORM (NOTE: THE NOVEMBER 1 </p><p>OFFICIAL RADIO COMMENTARY ALSO CRITICIZED THE </p><p>"RUSH," USING THE SAME WORD MUSA DID -- "HARWALA"). </p><p> </p><p>9. IN AUTHORIZING THE ENTRY OF STRANDED </p><p>PALESTINIANS EXPELLED BY QADHAFI, ASAD ACHIEVED THE </p><p>GOALS QADHAFI TRIED TO ACHIEVE THROUGH HIS </p><p>EXPULSION ORDER, WITHOUT ANY OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AND ARAB CRITICISM THE LIBYAN LEADER SUFFERED.  IN </p><p>ONE FELL SWOOP, ASAD GOT TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT SYRIA </p><p>CALLS A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW OF THE ISRAELI-PLO </p><p>AGREEMENTS -- THE LACK OF THE RIGHT OF RETURN -- </p><p>AND SIMULTANEOUSLY RECEIVED GLOWING PRAISE FROM THE </p><p>STRANDED PALESTINIANS.  (COMMENT: IF WE WERE </p><p>CONSPIRACY THEORISTS LIKE THE SYRIANS, WE WOULD </p><p>ALMOST THINK ASAD PUT QADHAFI UP TO HIS EXPULSION </p><p>ORDER.)  AT THE RECENT NAM SUMMIT IN COLOMBIA, THE </p><p>SARG EVEN TOOK IT UPON ITSELF TO BLOCK COSTA RICA\'S </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN THE NAM BECAUSE THAT COUNTRY </p><p>MAINTAINS AN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. AS ASAD CONTINUES TO TRY TO BUILD HIS LEGACY </p><p>AND HELP HIS SON AND OTHERS ASSUME COMMAND AFTER HE </p><p>DIES, THE IMAGE OF ASAD\'S LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>"THE BEATING HEART OF ARABISM" CAN ONLY INTENSIFY. </p><p>HE WILL VIEW ISSUES IN THE SYRIAN TRACK THROUGH THE </p><p>OPTIC OF ARAB PUBLIC OPINION, EVEN IF IT IS ONLY </p><p>THE IMAGE OF THAT OPINION HE HAS CREATED FOR </p><p>HIMSELF.  THIS PERSPECTIVE, WHILE USEFUL TO HIM IN </p><p>THE CONTEXT OF HIS DEALINGS WITH THE ISRAELIS AND </p><p>OTHER ARABS, IS ULTIMATELY AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF </p><p>INTERNAL LEGITIMACY FOR A MINORITY REGIME WHICH </p><p>SEEKS TO PREEMPT POTENTIAL OPPOSITION AT HOME. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROSS </p><p></p></div>
