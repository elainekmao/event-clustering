IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) SENIOR </p><p>ADVISOR CLIVE PUZEY (PROTECT) INFORMED POLITICAL SECTION </p><p>CHIEF ON FEBRUARY 2 THAT OVER THE JANUARY 27-28 WEEKEND, </p><p>GOODSON NGUNI, REPORTEDLY A RELATIVE OF SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT AND SENIOR ZANU-PF POLITBURO MEMBER EMMERSON </p><p>MNANGAGWA, INVITED THE OPPOSITION PARTY TO ENTER </p><p>FORTHWITH INTO A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY.  ONLY </p><p>PUZEY AND NGUNI WERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING, BUT PUZEY </p><p>LATER BRIEFED MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND TWO </p><p>OTHER SENIOR OPPOSITION PARTY MEMBERS ON THE SUBSTANCE </p><p>OF THE DISCUSSION.  ZANU-PF WAS PREPARED TO OFFER THE </p><p>MDC 40 PERCENT OF CABINET POSITIONS PLUS A VICE </p><p>PRESIDENCY, ACCORDING TO PUZEY.  IN EXCHANGE, THE ZANU- </p><p>PF OFFICIAL REPORTEDLY WANTED THE MDC\'S AGREEMENT </p><p>NEITHER TO HOLD A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2002 NOR </p><p>PROSECUTE SENIOR ZANU-PF MEMBERS FOR PAST MISDEEDS. </p><p>PUZEY LISTENED, MADE NO COMMITMENTS AND SUBSEQUENTLY, </p><p>WITH TSVANGIRAI\'S BLESSING, AGREED TO CONTINUE LOW </p><p>PROFILE MEETINGS OUTSIDE ZIMBABWE, PERHAPS IN LUSAKA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE MDC\'S THINKING ON THE OFFER WAS STILL </p><p>INCHOATE BUT THE PARTY HAS NOT DISMISSED IT OUT OF HAND, </p><p>PUZEY ALLOWED.  HE SAID THE OPPOSITION PARTY WOULD </p><p>INSIST ON HEADING THE ECONOMIC POLICY MINISTRIES AND </p><p>HOME AFFAIRS, AND ON THEIR CABINET MINISTERS BEING ABLE </p><p>TO SPEAK FREELY.  THE VICE PRESIDENCY IS OUT, HE STATED, </p><p>AS IT WOULD TIE UP A SENIOR MDC FIGURE IN A POWERLESS IF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00628  021116Z </p><p>PRESTIGIOUS POST, AND THE MDC LIKELY WOULD INSIST ON </p><p>GOING AHEAD WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2002. </p><p>PUZEY CLAIMED THAT FIVE ZANU-PF MINISTERS, INCLUDING </p><p>SIMBA MAKONI AND NKOSANA MOYO, WERE FED UP AND "ARE ON </p><p>BOARD WITH US."  THE MDC LEADERSHIP IS ALSO CONCERNED </p><p>THAT IT WILL BE UNABLE TO CONTAIN A WAVE OF VIOLENCE </p><p>THAT ITS ANGRY MEMBERS MIGHT START SPONTANEOUSLY, </p><p>POSSIBLY LEADING TO A DE FACTO CIVIL WAR.  MOREOVER, OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR SAID, EVEN IF THE MDC WINS THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, ZANU-PF WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PARTY </p><p>TO ASSUME POWER.  INSTEAD, PRESIDENT MUGABE ALMOST </p><p>CERTAINLY WOULD DECLARE MARTIAL LAW AND RULE BY DECREE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: PUZEY HAD NO GOOD ANSWER AS TO WHY </p><p>ZANU-PF IS SENDING OUT SUCH A FEELER, ALTHOUGH WE FIND </p><p>THE OFFER A CREDIBLE ONE.  IN OUR OPINION, THE RULING </p><p>PARTY IS UNDER STRONG PRESSURE FROM THE UNDER-PERFORMING </p><p>ECONOMY, THE LOOMING POOR HARVEST, INCREASING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION, AND AN OPPOSITION THAT IS </p><p>REAPING POLITICAL CAPITAL FROM ITS MISHAPS.  IT MAKES </p><p>SENSE TO TAKE THE BOLD STROKE OF BRINGING THE OPPOSITION </p><p>INTO THE TENT AND GIVE IT IMPOSSIBLY DIFFICULT </p><p>PORTFOLIOS AT WHICH IT WOULD FAIL.  IN THE MINDS OF </p><p>ZANU-PF STRATEGISTS, THE ATTACKS IN THE FOREIGN PRESS </p><p>WOULD THEN CEASE AND THE DONOR COMMUNITY WOULD OPEN ITS </p><p>PURSE TO FUND LAND REFORM AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. </p><p>MOST IMPORTANTLY, MUGABE WOULD REMAIN IN POWER AND HIS </p><p>CRONIES WOULD ENJOY PROTECTION FROM THE LAW.  THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY THUS WOULD BE CO-OPTED, DISCREDITED OR </p><p>NEUTRALIZED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00628  021116Z </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: AT THE MOMENT IT APPEARS THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE GUNS AND THE MDC THE POLITICAL </p><p>LEGITIMACY HERE.  FOLLOWING THIS OFFER, WE IMAGINE THE </p><p>OPPOSITION FINDS ITSELF ON THE HORNS OF A DILEMMA. </p><p>SHOULD IT LEND ITS GOOD NAME TO THE GOVERNMENT IN THE </p><p>SEARCH FOR PEACE AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, OR SHOULD IT </p><p>FIGHT FOR POWER ON ITS OWN TERMS IN WHAT COULD BE A </p><p>PYRRHIC VICTORY, GIVEN THE VIOLENCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CLEARLY IS PREPARED TO DEPLOY IN SUCH A CONTEST?  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
