<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, BM, Human Rights, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMESE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE SHAN RAPE CASES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) RANGOON 941 </p><p>     B. (B) RANGOON 1070 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The GOB is continuing its investigation of </p><p>the Shan rape cases.  According to Brigadier General Kyaw </p><p>Thein, a national intelligence team has investigated the </p><p>first 71 of the 173 cases cited in the License to Rape report </p><p>and so far found evidence of rape in five cases.  The other </p><p>cases could not be substantiated, the Brigadier General </p><p>claimed, at least on the basis of the information in the </p><p>License to Rape report.  The team will reportedly complete </p><p>investigations of all 173 cases over the next several months. </p><p> The team has given a copy of its preliminary report to the </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and encouraged MFA to brief UN </p><p>Special Rapporteur Pinheiro on their findings.  We urged Kyaw </p><p>Thein to share the report in its entirety with Pinheiro so </p><p>that he could cross-check facts with sources in Thailand. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The GOB has continued its investigation of the Shan </p><p>rape cases that were first described by the Shan Human Rights </p><p>Foundation and the Shan Women\'s Action Network in their joint </p><p>report, License to Rape.  According to Brigadier General Kyaw </p><p>Thein, the GOB detailed a national intelligence team to look </p><p>into all 173 cases outlined in the report.  Thus far, the </p><p>team had completed the investigation of 71 cases.  Of those </p><p>71, 5 appeared to reflect real cases of rape, Kyaw Thein </p><p>commented.  The other 66 could not be substantiated, at least </p><p>thus far, on the basis of the information in the "License to </p><p>Rape" report.  Either the villages did not exist at the time </p><p>the incidents were reported to have taken place, or the </p><p>investigators were not able to trace the identities of the </p><p>women who claimed to be victims. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The five cases that the team had been able to </p><p>substantiate were cases number 55, 60, 3, 53, and 69 in the </p><p>License to Rape report.  However, in each case, and </p><p>particularly in regard to the last three cases, the facts </p><p>were slightly different from those described in the report. </p><p> </p><p>Case No. 55 - The License to Rape report states that the </p><p>SPDC\'s township officer, Captain Ant Maw raped a woman in her </p><p>home in Murng Wee village in Nam Kham township of </p><p>Northeastern Shan State.  According to the national </p><p>intelligence team, Captain Ant Maw and the woman had lived </p><p>together, but there was no rape.  Nevertheless, Captain Ant </p><p>Maw was reprimanded for conduct unbecoming an officer and </p><p>forced to retire. </p><p> </p><p>Case No. 60 - The License to Rape report states that Corporal </p><p>Naing Htay from 324th Light Infantry Battalion raped a </p><p>14-year-old invalid in Murng Yaen Village of Nam Tu township </p><p>in Shan State in August 1998.  According to the national </p><p>intelligence team, the culprit was a Lance Corporal Ton Naing </p><p>of the 324th LIB, who was subsequently convicted of rape and </p><p>sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with hard labor. </p><p> </p><p>Case No. 3 - The License to Rape report states that a soldier </p><p>from the 333rd Light infantry Battalion raped a 26-year-old </p><p>Lahu woman in Murng Sart township of Shan State in May 1992. </p><p>According to the national intelligence team, there was a rape </p><p>of a Lahu woman in that village by a Burmese Army soldier </p><p>from the 333rd Light Infantry Battalion, but the rape </p><p>occurred in April 1999, not May 1992.  The soldier\'s platoon </p><p>leader paid compensation to the woman and no complaint was </p><p>ever filed by the village.  The battalion did not report the </p><p>incident and no action was ever taken against the soldier. </p><p> </p><p>Case No. 53 - The License to Rape report states that a </p><p>soldier from Murng Ton raped a 29- year-old Lahu women in the </p><p>Murng Ton area on July 16, 1998.  According to the national </p><p>intelligence team, there is no record of a rape in 1998, but </p><p>a private from the 277th Light Infantry Battalion raped a </p><p>10-year-old Lahu girl in that area on April 17, 2002.  The </p><p>soldier fled, but was shot dead while resisting arrest </p><p>several days later. </p><p> </p><p>Case No. 69 - The License to Rape report states that two </p><p>soldiers from the 225th Light infantry battalion raped a </p><p>25-year-old woman in her home in Murng Ton township on </p><p>November 21, 1998.  Again, there is no evidence of a rape in </p><p>1998, but, according to the national intelligence team, on </p><p>August 27, 1995, a private from the 255th LIB raped a 20 </p><p>year-old Palaung girl in Murng Ton township.  The private was </p><p>convicted of rape and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment; his </p><p>two accomplices were given three years each and his platoon </p><p>leader was reprimanded for failing to maintain control of his </p><p>men. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Brigadier Kyaw Thein said that the national </p><p>intelligence team would look into the other 103 cases cited </p><p>in the License to Rape report.  He also said that the team </p><p>had given a copy of its preliminary report to the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs and had encouraged the Ministry to brief UN </p><p>Special Rapporteur Pinheiro on their findings.  Poloff </p><p>advised Brigadier Kyaw Thein that it would be best simply to </p><p>give Pinheiro a copy of the report.  He could then </p><p>cross-check the facts with sources in Thailand and get to the </p><p>bottom of the 66 cases the GOB had not been able to </p><p>substantiate, as well as the other 103 the GOB had yet to </p><p>look into.  Kyaw Thein said that he would find out if that </p><p>would be possible. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The GOB told us on August 1 (ref A) that it was aware </p><p>of 10 cases of rape involving soldiers in Shan and Kayah </p><p>states.  (It is possible that not all of these were </p><p>incorporated in the SHRF and SWAN report.)  On August 23, we </p><p>witnessed the ludicrous GOB press conference in which the </p><p>regime claimed that no soldiers were involved in rapes (ref </p><p>B).  The October 7 update from Brigadier General Kyaw Thein </p><p>-- one of the most credible and straight-forward Burmese </p><p>military officers -- appears to indicate that the Burmese </p><p>government finally recognizes that it has a serious human </p><p>rights and public relations problem on its hands.  While the </p><p>GOB seriously damaged the little credibility that it has with </p><p>the international community at its press conference on August </p><p>23, this ongoing investigation may herald an effort within </p><p>the military to come to terms with this issue.  Instilling </p><p>military discipline and justice, particularly in regard to </p><p>non-combatants in a guerrilla war, is the key to rectifying </p><p>this problem.  The upcoming Pinheiro visit may help in this </p><p>regard, if the GOB takes steps to involve him in a process </p><p>consistent with international standards (and credibility). </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
