<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001393 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POSTS FOR ESTOFF AND PAO </p><p>STATE FOR OES/PCI, EUR/SE, EUR/PPD </p><p>STATE PASS NSF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, TBIO, TSPL, TPHY, KGLB, KPAO, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: THE GLOBE PROGRAM: TURKEY\'S VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>REF. SECSTATE 6351 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Embassy met with GLOBE national coordinator Fatma Baykal </p><p>2/7 to explore ways to energize program activities.  Baykal </p><p>advised that despite great interest in the program, the </p><p>Ministry of National Education (MONE) is no longer able to </p><p>implement the program as fully as it would like. Baykal </p><p>advised, for example, that Turkey lost out on participating </p><p>in the successful IT Hasan grant proposal, a four-country </p><p>GLOBE project with Egypt, Jordan, Lebannon and Turkey, </p><p>because the GOT was unable to respond to its partners in a </p><p>timely fashion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  MONE has recommended that TUBITAK (the Scientific and </p><p>Research Council of Turkey) assume all national GLOBE </p><p>responsibilities and has asked embassy to facilitate a </p><p>smooth transition. TUBITAK has not yet responded to the MONE </p><p>request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Comment. Turkey was one of the early signers of the </p><p>GLOBE agreement (May 1995) but has allowed the program to </p><p>slow considerably since an enthusiastic start. TUBITAK\'s </p><p>GLOBE leadership has alluring possibilities but may be </p><p>fraught with bureaucratic obstacles.  Post will meet again </p><p>with MONE, confer with TUBITAK and advise on which agency is </p><p>likely to become party to the new NASA agreement. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
