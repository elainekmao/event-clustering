<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003220 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- A lead story in all papers today, June 17, focuses </p><p>on Israel\'s establishment of the "dividing wall" </p><p>between Israel and the West Bank.  A number of </p><p>commentaries lash out at Israel\'s "racist" policy. </p><p>Another front-page story, without commentary, </p><p>highlights the New York Times article about President </p><p>Bush\'s call on the CIA to find ways to oust the Saddam </p><p>Hussein regime of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The racist dividing wall" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/17) editorializes:  "Israel is going against the </p><p>current and the spirit of this century, which has </p><p>witnessed the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall </p><p>of the most racist division in South Africa.  This is </p><p>only so Israel can start its own stage of implementing </p><p>the same hateful policy, as it is determined to be the </p><p>last of all occupations and the last of racist </p><p>entities.  The Palestinians are not sorry to see their </p><p>occupiers hide behind walls and electrical fences. </p><p>This separation could have, however, taken place as a </p><p>result of a final solution, whereby this dividing wall </p><p>turns into international borders that separate between </p><p>a free and independent Palestine and the Hebrew state. </p><p>It is sad that these racist plans of isolation have </p><p>not received the international and American </p><p>condemnation they deserve.  In fact the plans are </p><p>understood by Washington in line with its policy of </p><p>blind bias in favor of the Hebrew state.  We condemn </p><p>this policy of racism.  We tell the government of </p><p>rabbis and generals that their protective walls will </p><p>not bring them safety and security, and that no matter </p><p>how much they fortify themselves, the will of the </p><p>Palestinians to be free and independent will </p><p>eventually win." </p><p> </p><p>--"The isolating wall: Israeli aggression with U.S. </p><p>blessing" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Rakan Majali writes on the back page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/17):  "It is obvious that Prime Minister Sharon </p><p>returned from the United States with ultimate support </p><p>for his plan to build a dividing wall and to impose </p><p>the ugliest form of racial discrimination.  The </p><p>interesting thing is the presence of this American </p><p>cover and a false screen that talks about initiatives </p><p>or ideas to be presented by the U.S. President.  In </p><p>our opinion, the Palestinian leadership and the Arabs </p><p>must seriously consider this most dangerous move, and </p><p>not be misled by these projects on papers, but to </p><p>focus on what is happening on the ground in the land </p><p>of Palestine." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Israel\'s dividing wall: an attack on international </p><p>legitimacy" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mazen Saket writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/16):  "Funny how this world sings the praises of </p><p>international legitimacy, asks us to respect and abide </p><p>by it and punishes those countries that rebel against </p><p>it and refuse to abide by it.  And there stands </p><p>Israel, despite all the international legitimacy </p><p>decisions that confirm the illegality of its </p><p>occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.  There\'s Israel, </p><p>setting up this dividing wall.  Israel is actually </p><p>setting the borders that it has decided for the </p><p>Palestinian state, before the negotiations, before </p><p>reaching agreements, and despite all the Security </p><p>Council resolutions.  Can we still talk about an </p><p>international conference and a settlement with Israel </p><p>on the basis of Security Council resolutions?" </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
