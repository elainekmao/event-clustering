This is the initial USG Disaster Assistance Response </p><p>Team (DART) daily cable that will report on the humanitarian </p><p>situation within Iraq from Kuwait City.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>DART ARRIVALS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Team West is fully constituted with the arrival of </p><p>NGaertner and JAcree.  On 22 March the following DART </p><p>members arrived in Kuwait: SHodgson, JPonte, CGarrett, </p><p>SBrown, and JGeran. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  There are several outstanding issues concerning the </p><p>Australian contribution of 100,000 metric tons (MT) of </p><p>wheat.  A shipment of 50,000 MT was diverted to Muscat, </p><p>Oman.  The second half of the shipment arrived in Muscat on </p><p>24 March.  The Government of Australia is discussing the </p><p>possibility of donating the 100,000 MT to the World Food </p><p>Program (WFP) once the emergency operation (EMOP) is issued. </p><p>Ongoing negotiations between Canberra and WFP continue over </p><p>support costs, estimated at between 15 and 25 million USD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  There is significant interest in having the USG\'s </p><p>financial support in this first shipment of wheat.  The </p><p>USG\'s role will be to contribute the missing support costs </p><p>and secure the double billing (US-Australia) of this </p><p>donation.  The arrival of these two wheat shipments, and the </p><p>enormous interest in the Persian Gulf region to demonstrate </p><p>that an efficient process is in place to move incoming food </p><p>quickly into Iraq, will accelerate the timetable for gaining </p><p>humanitarian access. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>OFFICE OF TRANSITION INITIATIVES (OTI) </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Radio Sawa is operational on the AM band and will </p><p>eventually switch to the FM band.  Reporting stringers and </p><p>radio specialists have been identified to highlight the </p><p>USG\'s overall humanitarian efforts within Iraq.  OTI </p><p>officers briefed DART/Kuwait staff on the role of Abuse </p><p>Prevention Officers (APOs) on 23 March. </p><p> </p><p>6.  On 22 March, the DART APOs met with representatives of </p><p>the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and </p><p>Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) in Kuwait City.  Several </p><p>weeks of coordination and collaboration with representatives </p><p>of both organizations had taken place in Washington, D.C. </p><p>prior to the APOs\' deployment.  ICRC and PHR representatives </p><p>stressed their support of the DART\'s Abuse Prevention </p><p>strategy and intend to work closely with APOs in Iraq. </p><p>Close coordination also continues between the DART and the </p><p>Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) </p><p>in order to develop plans for preventing, deterring, and </p><p>responding to human rights abuses within Iraq.  Another </p><p>coordination meeting with NGOs AND ORHA is being scheduled </p><p>for the week of 23 march.  The APOs are also actively </p><p>engaging with U.S military Civil Affairs units and are </p><p>arranging a meeting with Generals Garner and Kern to discuss </p><p>their initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>REFUGEES </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  There are no significant refugee flows out of Iraq to </p><p>date; however, more than 400 third country nationals (TCNS) </p><p>have crossed into Jordan.  The International Organization </p><p>for Migration facilitated the repatriation of 160 Sudanese </p><p>TCNS on 21 March, and an additional 160 Sudanese were </p><p>expected to return to Sudan on 22 March. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>MILITARY LIASION UNIT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Approximately 70 people, including Coalition Forces Land </p><p>Component Command (CFLCC) Civil Affairs Officers and </p><p>representatives from the United Nations, international </p><p>organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), </p><p>attended the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) briefing </p><p>on 22 March.  The following information was provided at the </p><p>briefing: there have been no major population movements </p><p>around Basra; UNSECOORD is weighing the possibility of going </p><p>to Phase 5 due to potential chemical threats from Iraqi </p><p>surface-to-surface missiles; the missile threat has been </p><p>reduced following forward ground movements deeper into Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The CFLCC C9 Commander stated that Maneuver Commanders </p><p>will make the decision to allow DART teams into permissive </p><p>environments within their AOR.  He also had no problems </p><p>allowing DART to work with Maneuver CA elements doing damage </p><p>assessments. </p><p> </p><p>10. The Liaison Officer from the 354 CA HQ plans to locate </p><p>at the DART Hotel location after the last serial leaves.  A </p><p>CA Liaison Officer will be embedded with the DART staff to </p><p>facilitate information, coordination, and movement forward </p><p>with CA elements throughout Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>11. According to Military Liaison Officer (MLO) reports, the </p><p>Kuwaiti Red Crescent was prevented from crossing into Iraq </p><p>on 22 March.  ICRC agreed with the order, stating that it </p><p>was the role of ICRC and not the Kuwaiti chapter. </p><p> </p><p>12. The Dart/Kuwait MLO will facilitate with the marine </p><p>expeditionary force (MEF) and the U.K. third Commando on </p><p>DART movement into Umm Qasr when the Dart Leader is </p><p>satisfied that security has been established at the port. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>CIVIL AFFAIRS ASSESSMENT OF UMM QASR/SAFWAN </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  Civil Affairs assessment teams conducted a rapid </p><p>assessment of the Port of Umm Qasr between 19 March and 22 </p><p>March.  The loading cranes have been maintained and are </p><p>functioning.  There was also a functioning fire truck in </p><p>excellent condition among more than 20 civilian vehicles, </p><p>indicating the potential for vehicle maintenance. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The port facility comprised multiple buildings and </p><p>warehouses, all containing civilian vehicles.  Reports </p><p>indicated that the port was fully functional, by Iraqi </p><p>standards. The local commander stated that the port </p><p>contained sea mines, but was unaware of any land mines. </p><p>However, one land mine was visible in the field outside of </p><p>the base. </p><p> </p><p>15. The port contains countless standard-sized containers, </p><p>both on rails and on the ground. No equipment to manage and </p><p>move this equipment was noted. There were also blue cranes, </p><p>three in one frame, approximately 100 plus feet high, as </p><p>well as several stationary cranes, approximately 50 plus </p><p>feet high. The main high power lines, running west from the </p><p>port to Safwan, appear intact. These high power lines are 3 </p><p>levels high. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Outside of Umm Qasr towards Safwan, several homes were </p><p>visible from the road.  The homes were inhabited by poor </p><p>Bedouins prior to the assault, and the local people are </p><p>reported to have begun returning. </p><p> </p><p>17.  As of 1100 hours 23 March, the road to Safwan from Umm </p><p>Qasr was completely intact.  The Gas Oil Separation Plant </p><p>along the route also appeared intact, as did the homes in </p><p>and around Safwan.  The people of Safwan appeared healthy, </p><p>although extremely poor.  No internally displaced persons </p><p>were seen. </p><p> </p><p>18.  No additional humanitarian assessment information is </p><p>available. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ANE - RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  On March 23, Ambassador Jones introduced ORHA Director </p><p>Garner, Relief Coordinator George Ward, and USAID\'s Lewis </p><p>Lucke to high-ranking Kuwaiti officials from the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs and the Kuwait Fund FOR ARAB ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT to describe the USG\'s plans for relief and </p><p>reconstruction in Iraq.  The Kuwaiti officials described </p><p>their own process of economic recovery after the 1991 </p><p>liberation and spoke of the importance of economic sector </p><p>reform in Iraq.  Kuwait may prove an early source of </p><p>investment for post-conflict Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>20.  Responsibility for leads in Iraqi Ministries has been </p><p>re-delegated by ORHA on instructions from the Department of </p><p>Defense (DOD).  The inter-agency process had previously </p><p>assigned responsibility for Iraqi Ministries among various </p><p>U.S. Departments and Agencies.  USAID was tasked for the </p><p>lead for the Ministries of Planning, Transport and </p><p>Communication, Agriculture, Education, Health, Housing and </p><p>Construction, Labor and Social Affairs, Irrigation and the </p><p>Electricity Commission.  Under the new ORHA plans, </p><p>individuals are recruited from various agencies, </p><p>predominantly State and DOD, to serve as the senior </p><p>Ministerial liaisons.  This group will include five </p><p>Ambassadors.  These individuals will report to the </p><p>appropriate ORHA function coordinator, either Lewis Lucke or </p><p>Michael Mobbs.  The liaisons reporting to Lewis Lucke are as </p><p>follows: a) Planning - Ambassador Dave Dunford-Robert </p><p>MacLeod/USAID to serve as interim; b)Transportation and </p><p>Communication - Dick Beard/State - Mike Moskowitz/DOD to </p><p>serve as interim; c) Finance - David Nummy/Treasury; d) </p><p>Agriculture - Lee Schatz/USDA; e) Education - USAID </p><p>Contractor - Dorothy Mazaka/USAID to serve as interim; f) </p><p>Health - Skip Burkle, USAID; g) Housing and Construction - </p><p>TBD - Mark Held/COE to serve as interim; h) Labor and Social </p><p>Affairs - TBD - Karen Walsh/USAID to serve as interim; i) </p><p>Irrigation - TBD - Stephen Browning/COE to serve as interim; </p><p>j) Central Bank - George Mullinax/Treasury; k) Electricity </p><p>Commission - TBD - Andy Bachus/COE to serve as interim. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
