KHATAMI LAVISHED PRAISE ON </p><p>HIZBALLAH AND WAS SOMEWHAT MORE RESERVED WITH AMAL, </p><p>THOUGH BERRI SCORED A VICTORY OF SORTS WITH THE </p><p>RE-OPENING OF THE AMAL OFFICE IN TEHRAN.  FIRMLY </p><p>FIXED BEHIND HIZBALLAH IN FUNDING AND POPULARITY, </p><p>INCREASED IRANIAN ATTENTION AND PLEDGES OF FUNDING FOR </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SOUTH ARE OPPORTUNITIES BERRI IS </p><p>EAGER TO EXPLOIT.

LAUDING HIZBALLAH AS </p><p>"THE SPARKLING AND SHINING JEWEL IN THE SKY OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC WORLD," KHATAMI HAILED THE PARTY AS A "MODEL" </p><p>FOR RESISTING ISRAELI AGGRESSION AND OCCUPATION. </p><p>PRAISING THE SACRIFICES HIZBALLAH, ITS MARTYRS, AND </p><p>SUPPORTERS HAVE MADE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THEIR </p><p>RESISTANCE, KHATAMI CALLED ON THE PARTY TO CONTINUE </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE PALESTINIANS, "THE MAJOR CAUSE OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC UMMA."  POINTING TO THE GROUP\'S "SUCCESS" IN </p><p>FORCING ISRAEL TO WITHDRAW FROM SOUTH LEBANON, KHATAMI </p><p>NOTED "AN ENEMY THAT WAS DEFEATED ONCE COULD BE </p><p>DEFEATED AGAIN."  IN RESPONSE, NASRALLAH STRESSED ARAB </p><p>AND ISLAMIC UNITY WAS NEEDED TO CONFRONT THE "ANGERED </p><p>ZIONIST ENTITY," AND TO ENSURE ADEQUATE MEANS TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE INTIFADA AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) FOLLOWING ON THE HEELS OF NASRALLAH WAS BERRI. </p><p>SOMEWHAT OUT OF PLACE AT A CONFERENCE CHAMPIONING THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAUSE, BERRI NONETHELESS SEIZED AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL ADVANCEMENT. </p><p>ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, HE THANKED KHATAMI FOR </p><p>ALLOWING AMAL TO OPEN AN OFFICE IN TEHRAN; KHATAMI </p><p>REPLIED "IRAN IS YOUR OFFICE."   DOLING OUT AN OUNCE </p><p>OF PRAISE FOR LEBANON\'S "OTHER" SHIA PARTY, KHATAMI </p><p>THANKED AMAL FOR ITS "STEADFASTNESS," AND BERRI FOR </p><p>HIS "GOOD ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION," REMARKING "WE </p><p>ALWAYS BENEFIT FROM MEETINGS WITH YOU."  BERRI WILL </p><p>NO DOUBT SEEK TO USE THIS MEETING TO ASSOCIATE </p><p>HIMSELF WITH ANY INCREASED STATE-TO-STATE FINANCIAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM TEHRAN, AND WITH A PROPOSED KHATAMI </p><p>VISIT TO LEBANON, IN HIS PERPETUAL POLITICAL STRUGGLE </p><p>WITH HIZBALLAH. </p><p> </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
