<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 08251 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, IR, PK, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN SEES SIGNS OF UPTURN IN IRAN-SOVIET </p><p>-         TIES </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY NAIK SUMMARIZED HIS </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S APPRAISAL OF UPTURN IN IRAN-SOVIET TIES. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR ASSERTS IRANIAN RATIONALE IS BASICALLY </p><p>PRAGMATIC AND ASSERTS TREND WILL CONTINUE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  RESPONDING TO MY EARLIER REQUEST FOR GOP THINKING </p><p>ON THE MEANING OF THE APRIL 5 VISIT TO MOSCOW OF IRANIAN </p><p>DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER HOSSEIN ARDEBILI, THE FOREIGN </p><p>SECRETARY APRIL 19 SUMMARIZED FOR POLCOUNSELOR AND ME A </p><p>CABLE JUST RECEIVED.  WE SHOULD PROTECT THE SOURCE </p><p>COMPLETELY. </p><p> </p><p>THE SIGNS OF AN UPTURN </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>4.  EARLY IN 1984, THE GOI HAD INDICATED ITS INTENTION </p><p>TO TRY THE TUDEH PARTY LEADERS, SENT LOW LEVEL OFFICIALS </p><p>TO THE SOVIET REVOLUTIONARY DAY CELEBRATIONS, AND </p><p>LIMITED SOVIET DIPLOMATS\' CONTACTS.  ALL THIS LEFT THE </p><p>SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN TEHRAN VOICING GLOOMY AND NEGATIVE </p><p>PROGNOSIS FOR RELATIONS. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  THE SOVIET PATIENCE NOW SEEMS TO BE BEARING FRUIT </p><p>AS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE IRANIANS POSTPONED THE TUDEH TRIALS (IN NOVEMBER); </p><p> </p><p>-- RAFSANJANI ATTENDED AND SPOKE PROFUSELY AT THE 10-DAY </p><p>DAWN(SIC) CELEBRATION; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- THE IRANIAN PRESS HAS STARTED TO CAST THE SOVIETS IN </p><p>A MORE FAVORABLE LIGHT. MOST RECENTLY A PROMINENT </p><p>COLUMNIST QUESTIONED THE GOVERNMENT\'S RATIONALE FOR NOT </p><p>HAVING CONSULTED WITH THE SOVIETS DURING RECENT </p><p>DIPLOMATIC DEMARCHES MADE WHEN THE WAR INTENSIFIED (WHY </p><p>NOT INCLUDE THE NUMBER ONE SUPERPOWER--OUR STRONG </p><p>NEIGHBOR?). </p><p>- </p><p>WHAT IRAN WANTS </p><p>--------------- </p><p>6.  IN CONTEXT OF AN INCREASINGLY COSTLY WAR, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR CONCLUDES IRAN SEEKS: </p><p> </p><p>-- TO EASE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, E.G., WITH POSSIBILITY </p><p>OF GAS SALES TO THE SOVIETS; </p><p> </p><p>-- SECURE LINES OF COMMUNICATION--THERE APPEARS TO BE </p><p>SOME UNCERTAINTY OVER THE TURKISH LOC; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- ESTABLISH ALTERNATIVE AIR ROUTES--THE IRAQI THREAT </p><p>HAS CUT MOST OF IRAN AIR\'S WESTWARD SERVICE, AND THE </p><p>SOVIETS HAVE OFFERED A NEW ROUTE TO FRANKFURT VIA </p><p>MOSCOW. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SEES A NUMBER OF TANGIBLE </p><p>INDICATORS ALREADY REFLECTING BENEFITS OF INCREASED </p><p>ECONOMIC COOPERATION: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SOVIETS ARE HELPING BUILD POWER GENERATORS, </p><p>AND SEEKING TO EXPAND THIS AREA OF COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- TWO-WAY TRADE IN 1985 SHOULD EXCEED $2 BILLION. </p><p> </p><p>-- A JOINT MINISTERIAL MEETING WILL BE HELD IN MAY-JUNE, </p><p>AND EXPERTS WILL MEET IN MOSCOW IN MAY TO LOOK AT OTHER </p><p>STEPS FOR ENHANCING ECONOMIC RELATIONS. </p><p>- </p><p>ARDEBILI VISIT </p><p>-------------- </p><p>8.  PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SURMISES THE SOVIETS WILL </p><p>HAVE REITERATED OPPOSITION TO THE WAR\'S CONTINUATION. </p><p>HE BELIEVES THE IRANIAN SIDE LIKELY ONLY LISTENED.  THE </p><p>IRANIANS WOULD HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT SOVIET ARMS </p><p>SUPPLIES TO IRAQ--WHETHER SOVIETS TAKE NOTE WILL </p><p>PROBABLY DEPEND ON SOVIET PERCEPTIONS OF IRAN\'S POST-WAR </p><p>INTENTIONS.  THE SOVIETS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO SEE IRAN </p><p>TOO STRONG. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SEES THESE CURRENT MOVES </p><p>AS A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE.  IRAN FEELS INCREASINGLY </p><p>ISOLATED.  ITS REMAINING ARAB SUPPORTERS, E.G., SYRIA </p><p>AND LIBYA, ARE SOVIET FRIENDS.  AMBASSADOR ASSERTS MANY </p><p>IRANIANS WOULD PREFER BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., </p><p>BUT THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY TIDE IS STILL FLOWING TOO </p><p>STRONG, THE U.S. IS NOT READY FOR SUCH MOVES, AND IN ANY </p><p>CASE IS TOO DISTANT.  RUSSIA ON THE OTHER HAND IS A </p><p>POWERFUL NEIGHBOR WHICH CAN DO IMMEDIATE GOOD OR EVIL. </p><p>- </p><p>10.  NAIK, EXTENDING THE POINT MADE ABOUT THE U.S., </p><p>NOTED THAT THE IRANIAN DELEGATION AT THE RECENT </p><p>ECONOMIC COOPERATION ORGANIZATION (ECO) COMMITTEE </p><p>MEETINGS HAD EXPANDED THE CONSENSUS TO GET TECHNICAL </p><p>COOPERATION (IF NECESSARY) FROM "WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED </p><p>COUNTRIES."  PAKISTAN AND TURKEY HAD INITIALLY PROMOTED </p><p>THE IDEA OF "REST OF THE WORLD" OUT OF CONCERN THAT </p><p>IRAN WOULD BALK AT A GROUPING THAT INCLUDED THE U.S.-- </p><p>INSTEAD THE IRANIANS EXPLICITLY EXPRESSED PREFERENCE </p><p>FOR THE WESTERN COUNTRIES FORMULATION. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT:  NO DOUBT THE GOP IS WATCHING THESE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS WITH CONSIDERABLE CONCERN.  THEY UNDERSTAND </p><p>OUR CONCERNS ABOUT IRANIAN STATE TERRORISM BUT WOULD </p><p>WELCOME U.S. MOVES TO EASE IRAN\'S ISOLATION.  SHORT OF </p><p>THAT THEY HOPE WE SHOW UNDERSTANDING AND PATIENCE AS </p><p>THEY WORK TO HELP KEEP IRAN FROM FALLING UNDER </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL SOVIET SWAY WITH ALL THAT WOULD MEAN FOR </p><p>PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN.  CERTAINLY THE LONG-TERM </p><p>RISKS FOR OUR INTERESTS DEMAND WE TAKE SUCH AN </p><p>ATTITUDE. </p><p> </p><p>HINTON </p><p></p></div>
