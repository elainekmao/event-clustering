<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 AMMAN 003947 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KISL, PTER, EFIN, EAID, KPAO, KDEM, KIRF, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: ENGAGING ISLAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 61142 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Embassy Amman\'s chief goals include promoting </p><p>moderation and reform within Jordan through contact work and </p><p>a wide range of programs.  Our Economic Reform efforts seek </p><p>to achieve these goals through improved living standards, </p><p>increased employment opportunities, and encouraging Jordan\'s </p><p>continued commitment to economic reform and liberalization. </p><p>Political Reform efforts aim at consolidating past democratic </p><p>changes and advocating greater liberalization in Jordan, </p><p>consistent with U.S. interests.  Education Reform efforts are </p><p>geared towards skills enhancement and inculcating civic </p><p>education and democratic values.  The Embassy\'s efforts in </p><p>the area of Civil Society seek to achieve a number of key </p><p>objectives including greater transparency and respect for </p><p>human rights.  Finally, Embassy programs aim at promoting </p><p>Religious Moderation and Tolerance as ends in themselves. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Despite the extent and effectiveness of our efforts at </p><p>promoting moderation and reform, we are not the only force at </p><p>work in Jordan.  Islamists have their own highly-developed </p><p>programs for assisting people and, ultimately, consolidating </p><p>political power through them.  The Muslim Brotherhood </p><p>provides charitable assistance directly in the form of food, </p><p>money, and tuition grants.  It also has influence in </p><p>government-run institutions such as hospitals, schools, </p><p>universities, and religious enterprises.  Because of these </p><p>programs, the Muslim Brotherhood claims (without further </p><p>justification) it offers assistance in more cities and towns </p><p>throughout Jordan -- and therefore by implication has more </p><p>supporters -- than the GOJ itself.  Jordan contains may poor, </p><p>unemployed, disillusioned, and otherwise disenfranchised </p><p>persons who turn to movements or causes like the Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood that may appear to offer them redress. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In point of fact, there has been a significant </p><p>Islamist presence among Jordan\'s predominantly moderate </p><p>population since at least 1945.  Islamists in Jordan (mainly </p><p>and most importantly the Muslim Brotherhood and its political </p><p>arm, the Islamic Action Front) are well-organized and often </p><p>highly-educated, with a significant history of participation </p><p>in Jordanian public life.  Support for Islamic activism is </p><p>heaviest in but not exclusive to metropolitan Amman.  In past </p><p>elections, Islamists have won at many as 27.5% of the </p><p>parliamentary seats in districts spanning much of the length </p><p>of Jordan from Irbid in the north to Tafileh in the south. </p><p>There is a strong perception that Islamist influence has </p><p>grown since the start of the Al-Aqsa Intifada and in the wake </p><p>of the U.S.-led war on terrorism.  Extreme Islamist rhetoric </p><p>can be strongly anti-American. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Embassy programs have helped dampen anti-American </p><p>sentiment in some quarters.  But, given Jordan\'s place in the </p><p>center of a tense, combustible, and economically troubled </p><p>region, extreme Islamist rhetoric resonates more strongly </p><p>than it otherwise would and can breed sympathy for terrorism </p><p>even in Jordan.  Jordan\'s situation therefore calls for </p><p>careful evaluation of our past efforts at promoting </p><p>moderation and reform as well as for careful consideration of </p><p>the path ahead.  The following paragraphs address both of </p><p>these topics in detail. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Economic Reform </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Jordan has made significant strides towards improving </p><p>its investment climate, and its privatization program is </p><p>widely viewed as the best in the Middle East and one of the </p><p>best among developing countries world-wide.  Jordan has far </p><p>outpaced the region in recent years by enacting economic </p><p>reforms that allowed it to accede to the WTO in 2000 in </p><p>record time, and become fully TRIPS-consistent in the </p><p>process.  Jordan also entered into a Free Trade Agreement </p><p>(FTA) with the United States in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Jordan\'s macroeconomic fundamentals are sound, and the </p><p>Kingdom is set to enjoy a third straight year of 4%-plus GDP </p><p>growth.  But there remains a large gap between performance </p><p>and expectations, which have been inflated by highly </p><p>publicized reform efforts that have had little tangible </p><p>effect at the microeconomic level.  GDP growth has not </p><p>noticeably improved incomes or job opportunities, in large </p><p>part because population growth rates are high (over 2.8%). </p><p>As a result, wages are stagnant and unemployment remains high </p><p>(15% by GOJ/IMF estimates).  Bureaucratic inefficiencies and </p><p>corruption/"wasta" also hamper growth.  Moreover, regional </p><p>factors (i.e., sanctions against Iraq and ongoing violence in </p><p>Israel and the West Bank) mar Jordan\'s economic landscape by </p><p>adversely impacting tourism, trade, and foreign investment. </p><p>Ultimately, resolution of the "expectations gap" requires </p><p>economic growth that significantly outpaces population </p><p>growth, resulting in higher living standards and increased </p><p>employment opportunities. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Current efforts: Much of Jordan\'s progress has </p><p>resulted, and continues to result, from our multi-faceted </p><p>assistance programs.  USAID programs in particular foster </p><p>policy and regulatory reform, job creation, trade-capacity </p><p>building for small Jordanian companies, and access to </p><p>microfinance for low-income sectors of the economy.  USAID is </p><p>also working with the GOJ to decrease the population growth </p><p>rate, as a means of reigning in this significant drag on per </p><p>capita GDP growth.  Many of USAID\'s economic programs are </p><p>centered on supporting two tracks, the U.S.-Jordan FTA and </p><p>King Abdullah\'s recently announced Social and Economic </p><p>Transformation Plan (SETP).  The FTA has become a major </p><p>centerpiece of our efforts to boost job creation.  Although </p><p>the FTA is only 7 months old, a dozen or so local companies </p><p>have already benefited by at least $7 million and additional </p><p>projects are in the pipeline.  The SETP seeks to broaden the </p><p>impact of positive economic change so that it is felt </p><p>throughout all segments of Jordanian society. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Another USG initiative, the Qualifying Industrial </p><p>Zones (QIZ) initiative, is perhaps our most impressive </p><p>success story.  Designed to enhance Jordanian-Israeli </p><p>commercial contacts, the QIZs are beginning to transform </p><p>Jordan\'s economy and social structure.  The QIZs have </p><p>generated over 22,000 jobs since 1998 and over $210 million </p><p>in exports during 2001 alone.  Over 70% of QIZ jobs go to </p><p>women, many of whom have never worked outside the home.  And </p><p>the jobs, along with the multiplier effects of their wages on </p><p>local economies, are creating pockets of support for </p><p>political moderation in traditionally conservative </p><p>communities. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Looking Ahead: Given the potentially destabilizing </p><p>impact of poverty in general and the "expectations gap" in </p><p>particular, King Abdullah recently announced the SETP.  The </p><p>SETP seeks to spread benefits of growth expected from ongoing </p><p>economic policy reforms to lower-income Jordanians.  Our </p><p>current and future economic assistance programs will support </p><p>the SETP.  Apart from its direct developmental benefits, the </p><p>SETP seeks to bolster political stability by ensuring that </p><p>all Jordanians have a stake in Jordan,s future.  Stability </p><p>in Jordan will, in turn, promote regional stability.  USAID </p><p>projects will continue to play a major role in addressing </p><p>many of the areas related to poverty alleviation, health, </p><p>water, and economic opportunity. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The GOJ has risked a lot by undertaking comprehensive </p><p>economic reforms, both in terms of its relationships with its </p><p>neighbors (notably Iraq and Syria), and internally by </p><p>exposing Jordan\'s economy to global competition.  We, in </p><p>turn, have a great deal at stake in Jordan\'s economic success </p><p>-- not just in aid dollars, but in the political dividends </p><p>that will accrue if Jordan emerges as a positive exemplar of </p><p>liberalization\'s effects on a developing country.  Creating </p><p>such a positive example not only advances our MEPP goals, but </p><p>also furthers our counter-terrorism goals by using </p><p>prosperity-derived economic development to discourage new </p><p>recruits to terrorist organizations.  We must make all </p><p>reasonable efforts to ensure that Jordan succeeds, so that </p><p>the GOJ remains solidly behind reform and other governments </p><p>in the region see that the U.S. supports strong internal </p><p>commitment to reform.  This means, inter alia, supporting </p><p>Jordan\'s debt reform efforts, helping Jordan accede to the </p><p>WTO\'s Government Procurement Agreement, maintaining robust </p><p>ESF and FMF levels, and assisting the GOJ in making the SETP </p><p>succeed. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Political Reform </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The Jordanian Political System: Jordan\'s Constitution </p><p>describes the country\'s system of government as </p><p>"parliamentary with a hereditary monarchy."  Although </p><p>directly elected legislative assemblies have served </p><p>sporadically in Jordan since the 1920s, the period since 1989 </p><p>has marked a new era in Jordan\'s political history, with </p><p>increased openness towards opposition groups, restoration of </p><p>electoral and parliamentary processes previously suspended, </p><p>and recognition of political parties.  The GOJ allowed </p><p>Islamists to participate in the 1989 parliamentary elections, </p><p>where they won 27.5% of the seats.  Islamists won only 20% of </p><p>the seats in the 1993 elections, and then boycotted the 1997 </p><p>elections.  Parliament was dissolved in June 2001 and has not </p><p>been reconstituted.  Nor have new elections been announced. </p><p>Several long-time Embassy contacts predict Islamists would </p><p>win around 22% of the seats if elections were held today, and </p><p>more than that if the regional situation deteriorates further. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Current Programs: Since Parliament is not now in </p><p>session, the Embassy does not currently attend parliamentary </p><p>meetings.  However, Embassy Officers attended Parliament </p><p>frequently in the past and continue to meet regularly with </p><p>parliamentarians and other persons representing all facets </p><p>and levels of Jordanian political life.  Recent months have </p><p>seen the restoration of contacts between the Embassy and </p><p>moderate leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood opposition and its </p><p>political arm in Jordan, the Islamic Action Front.  The </p><p>Islamist political leadership has committed to continued </p><p>dialogue with the Embassy and to additional meetings. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The GOJ has generally supported the Embassy\'s </p><p>advocacy on behalf of U.S. interests.  We have no better </p><p>regional partner on counter-terrorism than Jordan.  Our deep </p><p>military-to-military relationship facilitates cooperation in </p><p>military operations, from Afghanistan to a number of United </p><p>Nations peacekeeping deployments.  Recently, the GOJ went on </p><p>record hailing President Bush\'s June 24 speech on the Middle </p><p>East as marking "the beginning of the end of the conflict </p><p>between Arabs and Israelis," despite very widespread </p><p>criticism of the speech within Jordan and throughout the </p><p>region. </p><p>14. (C) Looking Ahead: We are actively encouraging the GOJ to </p><p>hold free, fair, and open elections leading to the </p><p>restoration of a functioning Parliament, at the earliest </p><p>reasonable opportunity.  In addition, our 2004 Mission </p><p>Performance Plan proposes a number of other measures aimed at </p><p>consolidating past democratic changes and promoting greater </p><p>liberalization in Jordan (see below). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Education Reform </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The Jordanian Educational System: Jordan enjoys </p><p>relatively high educational status in terms of access to </p><p>education and education levels, compared to other Arab </p><p>Countries.  It has the second highest adult literacy rate in </p><p>the region, at over 86%.  On the other hand, illiteracy among </p><p>women (20.6%) is more than twice the rate for men (9.9%) and </p><p>illiteracy is especially high (27-28%) in some tribal and </p><p>rural areas like Ma\'an and Mafraq.  Education is compulsory </p><p>through the tenth grade.  As of 1997, there were seven public </p><p>and thirteen private universities.  Due to the overall </p><p>strength of Jordan\'s educational system, broad-based </p><p>education reform programs are not called for.  However, the </p><p>present Minister of Education is U.S.-educated, and wants to </p><p>modernize and upgrade a number of elements in the curriculum. </p><p> Moreover, there is a need to address pockets of illiteracy </p><p>affecting certain geographic areas and gender/ethnic </p><p>groupings. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Current Programs: The Embassy is working closely with </p><p>Ministry of Education officials in the areas of </p><p>English-language instruction and civic education.  Around </p><p>thirty Peace Corps volunteers are working (primarily in rural </p><p>areas) to improve English skills among local teaching staff </p><p>and students, upgrade teaching resources and materials, and </p><p>develop innovative and effective pedagogical methods that </p><p>complement Jordan\'s national curriculum.  The Embassy is also </p><p>involved in a second program specifically aimed at improving </p><p>English-language instruction in the middle schools.  (The </p><p>British Embassy\'s elementary-school English-language program </p><p>complements this program.)  Our middle-school program </p><p>includes the teaching of English at model schools using </p><p>English-language textbooks.  Finally, teacher training is </p><p>complete for a third program involving civic education and </p><p>democracy, using textbooks that adapt U.S. models to the </p><p>Jordanian context.  The civic education/democracy program is </p><p>scheduled to enter classrooms in twenty schools this </p><p>September.  While high-level Ministry of Education officials </p><p>strongly support these programs, lower-level Islamist </p><p>employees criticize what they label "propagandization" </p><p>through the use of U.S. textbooks. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) In the area of higher education, the Embassy is </p><p>involved with U.S.-Jordanian academic exchange programs, </p><p>support of Jordanian post-graduate and post-doctoral students </p><p>attending U.S. universities through the Fulbright program, </p><p>and one of only two American Studies programs in the region </p><p>(at Jordan University).  These programs are received </p><p>enthusiastically by Jordanians, and they carry great weight </p><p>in promoting a positive understanding of American society, </p><p>culture, government, and institutions.  The Embassy also </p><p>supports increased use of the English language and quality </p><p>English teaching at many levels through the Regional English </p><p>Language Office, the Arabic Book Translation Program, the </p><p>American Language Center, the American Center for Oriental </p><p>Research, and other initiatives.  1700 students, for example, </p><p>received English-language instruction through the American </p><p>Language Center in FY2001.  During the same year, six books </p><p>translated through the Arabic Book Translation Program were </p><p>accepted as textbooks or as assigned reading in Jordanian </p><p>universities.  The AMIDEAST office in Amman provides </p><p>counseling and information services to Jordanians who wish to </p><p>study in the United States. </p><p>18. (C) Looking Ahead: Much of our work will lie in </p><p>continuing or expanding upon the range of successful programs </p><p>we are currently involved in.  At the middle-school level, </p><p>expansion will involve the maturation of pilot </p><p>English-language and civic education programs as they enter </p><p>the mainstream curriculum throughout Jordan.  We also </p><p>anticipate expansion in other areas, including preschool and </p><p>life-skills education, particularly for women and girls. </p><p>There is, as noted above, a fear in some quarters that our </p><p>involvement in reforming middle school curricula is aimed at </p><p>promoting a "secret" U.S. agenda.  While such fears do not </p><p>presently pose a serious risk of undermining our efforts, </p><p>this risk should be monitored and assessed periodically. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Civil Society </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) Jordanian Civil Society: NGOs promoting a number of </p><p>important aims ranging from human rights to health care and </p><p>economic development operate within Jordan.  Some of the many </p><p>NGOs operating in Jordan include Save the Children (operating </p><p>a junior-achievement type program), the Cooperative Housing </p><p>Foundation (micro-enterprise financing), the Royal Society </p><p>for the Conservation of Nature (environmental conservation </p><p>and rural economic growth), the American Center for Oriental </p><p>Research (restoration and preservation of antiquities), </p><p>Habitat for Humanity (low-income housing), the Royal </p><p>Commission on Human Rights (monitoring cases alleging human </p><p>rights violations), the Jordanian Society for Citizens\' </p><p>Rights (human rights and other issues), the Jordanian Women\'s </p><p>Union (women\'s rights), the Jordan Evangelical Theological </p><p>Seminary (training of Christian pastors and missionaries), </p><p>and the International Labor Organization (labor issues). </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) Regional tensions present the GOJ with difficult </p><p>choices in balancing public order with open expression. </p><p>Despite Jordan\'s history as one of the more open systems of </p><p>civil society in the region, and the existence of a vibrant </p><p>NGO culture within Jordan, critics charge that the GOJ has </p><p>retrenched on its recognition of press freedoms and freedom </p><p>of association since the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Intifada. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) Current Programs: Our programs promoting civil </p><p>society target a number of areas, some mediated through NGOs </p><p>like those listed above and others through direct Embassy </p><p>involvement.  As examples of the former, the Embassy </p><p>supported creation of the Royal Commission on Human Rights as </p><p>well as the Arab Society for Civic Education (a regional </p><p>civil society NGO headquartered in Jordan) -- both of which </p><p>institutions now operate without direct Embassy oversight. </p><p>As examples of the latter, the Embassy sponsors speaker </p><p>programs aimed at encouraging women to vote and participate </p><p>in local politics, as well as exchange programs designed to </p><p>expose Jordanians to U.S. institutions and society.  The </p><p>Embassy co-sponsors with NGOs numerous workshops, lectures, </p><p>and other programs directed at promoting democracy and human </p><p>rights. </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) Other programs seek to encourage ethics and </p><p>transparency in bureaucratic processes.  We are also engaged </p><p>in the area of judicial reform, where the Embassy sponsors </p><p>exchange visitor programs exposing key members of Jordan\'s </p><p>judicial establishment to key elements of the U.S. legal </p><p>system.  The Embassy has directed, and continues to direct, </p><p>resources into a number of programs intended to improve the </p><p>efficiency of Jordan\'s legal system, including English </p><p>language instruction for judges, Alternative Dispute </p><p>Resolution training programs, and case management training. </p><p>Finally, the Embassy supports, through the USAID Mission, </p><p>development of private business associations as advocacy </p><p>groups and spokespersons for private enterprise.  These </p><p>associations promote private sector-led development of </p><p>Jordan\'s economy and encourage a new generation of business </p><p>leaders who understand "new economic" principles. </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) One important lesson deriving from our past </p><p>experience with promoting civil society in Jordan is that, </p><p>while it is often possible to gain converts and funding for </p><p>"new" projects, it is much more difficult to secure long-term </p><p>support.  After an initial "honeymoon" period, some of our </p><p>best programs either wither for lack of follow-on funding, or </p><p>are taken over by other embassies and organizations.  For </p><p>example, some of our ideas for elementary educational reform </p><p>have been adopted by the British Embassy acting under the </p><p>auspices of the British Council. </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) Looking Ahead: As with programs geared towards </p><p>educational reform, much of our future work in building civil </p><p>society will center on the continuation or expansion of the </p><p>successful programs we are currently involved in, including </p><p>speaker programs, exchange programs, and programs with NGOs. </p><p>In addition, the GOJ (with assistance from USAID) is </p><p>introducing a pilot "village clusters" community development </p><p>program working with both international and local NGOs to </p><p>promote grass-roots development based on local involvement </p><p>and priorities, as part of the SETP.  We will assist in the </p><p>continued rollout of this important program in coming years. </p><p>We are also working with various governmental and </p><p>non-governmental organizations to fight honor killings, </p><p>support implementation of the International Labor </p><p>Organization\'s core labor standards, and more generally </p><p>enhance the already healthy respect for workers\' rights in </p><p>Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Religious Moderation and Tolerance </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) Religious Moderation and Tolerance in Jordan:  About </p><p>96% of Jordan\'s 5.2 million inhabitants are Sunni Muslim. </p><p>The GOJ estimates the percentage of the population that is </p><p>Christian at about 4%, although the actual figure is probably </p><p>lower.  There are also small numbers of adherents to Druze, </p><p>Shi\'a, and Baha\'a traditions.  Jordan\'s Constitution calls </p><p>for the safeguarding of "all forms of worship and religious </p><p>rites" within certain limitations, and states "there shall be </p><p>no legal discrimination with regard to Jordanians\' rights and </p><p>duties based on . . . religion." </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) As an example of the depth to which principles of </p><p>religious tolerance permeate, Christian students are not </p><p>required to attend religious instruction required for Muslims </p><p>in public schools.  As another illustration, the Royal </p><p>Institute for Interfaith Studies and the Royal Academy for </p><p>Islamic Civilization Research sponsor research, conferences, </p><p>and discussion on a wide range of religious, social, and </p><p>historical topics from both Muslim and Christian </p><p>perspectives.  Political Islam finds expression in Jordan\'s </p><p>relatively moderate version of the Muslim Brotherhood, the </p><p>Islamic Action Front (the Muslim Brotherhood\'s Political </p><p>Party arm), and other more moderate (and less important) </p><p>Islamist political parties. </p><p> </p><p>27. (C) Current Programs: The Embassy has a number of </p><p>programs aimed at furthering inter-religious dialogue and </p><p>tolerance and, more specifically, at engaging Islam.  The </p><p>Embassy has sponsored successful speaker programs aimed at </p><p>accurately portraying Islam in the United States, some in </p><p>cooperation with Islamist NGOs such as the Center for Islamic </p><p>Thought.  The Embassy recently brought Georgetown </p><p>University\'s Imam Yahya Hendi to Jordan as an exchange </p><p>visitor.  During his highly successful visit, Hendi </p><p>communicated his view of Muslim experience in the U.S. </p><p>post-9/11, to counter rumors and anecdotes now circulating in </p><p>the region about treatment of Muslims in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>28. (C) Looking Ahead: Our program efforts for visiting </p><p>Muslim scholars have been very successful, though more </p><p>efforts along these lines are clearly called for.  One </p><p>important lesson learned through our exchange visitor </p><p>programs is that, whereas visitors attempting to justify U.S. </p><p>policy in political terms often fail to get their message </p><p>across, visitors taking more indirect approaches (e.g., </p><p>explaining the nature of Islam in America) often encounter </p><p>more success.  Apart from bringing U.S. speakers to Jordan, </p><p>we should also encourage greater dialogue between Muslim </p><p>religious leaders in Jordan and their counterparts in the </p><p>U.S.  One way to do this might be to encourage Muslim </p><p>institutions in the U.S. to sponsor conferences in Jordan or </p><p>Jordanian visitors to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>29. (C) Jordan is wedged among Israel, the West Bank, Syria, </p><p>Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, at the center of a tense and </p><p>combustible region of vital interest to the United States. </p><p>Jordan\'s geographical and political position in the region </p><p>present a number of unique challenges, which we must account </p><p>for in our attempts to promote moderation and reform within </p><p>the country.  Along with the challenges, a number of positive </p><p>factors make Jordan a relatively fertile ground for our </p><p>efforts.  These positive factors include a reform-minded </p><p>King, a savvy albeit nascent business elite that is </p><p>supportive of Jordan\'s efforts to enter the global economy, </p><p>and a moderate Islamist movement that professes support for </p><p>the existing regime and a willingness to engage in dialogue. </p><p>Within this framework, our efforts and programs hold great </p><p>potential for continued success. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
