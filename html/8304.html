English and vernacular coverage </p><p>of the announcement was heavily covered in Sri Lankan </p><p>weekend newspapers.  One English opposition paper commented </p><p>on US and international involvement in Tokyo (5/25), </p><p>"Obviously if the world community did not believe that </p><p>there was a genuine possibility of working out a durable </p><p>peace here, they would not be devoting their time, energy </p><p>and money in backing the effort."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>2.  Television. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>Independent and government-owned television stations </p><p>heralded Armitage\'s decision to attend the Tokyo Conference </p><p>in English, Sinhala and Tamil newscasts (5/24). </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>3.  Headlines. </p><p>------ </p><p>English and vernacular coverage of Armitage\'s announcement </p><p>was heavy in Sri Lankan weekend newspapers.  Opposition </p><p>English daily ISLAND scooped on 5/24 with, "US will attend </p><p>Tokyo conference." Government-owned Sinhala daily DINAMINA, </p><p>headlined (5/25), "`Japan Aid Conference to be held as </p><p>scheduled\' - American State Department."  Government-owned </p><p>Sinhala weekly SILUMINA reported (5/25), "\'Go ahead with </p><p>Japan Aid Conference\'-says America," while state-owned </p><p>Tamil weekly, THINAKARAN VAARAMANJARI ran a stronger </p><p>headline (5/25), "`Irreparable loss to Sri Lanka if the </p><p>Tokyo Conference does not take place\'- Richard Armitage." </p><p>----- </p><p>4.  Editorial Comment. </p><p>----- </p><p>On 5/25, under the headline, "The Tigers and Tokyo," </p><p>opposition English weekly ISLAND SUNDAY commented on U.S. </p><p>and international involvement in Tokyo: "Obviously if the </p><p>world community did not believe that there was a genuine </p><p>possibility of working out a durable peace here, they would </p><p>not be devoting their time, energy and money in backing the </p><p>effort." The editor also observed, "If the Tigers really </p><p>feel for their people, their duty lies in maximizing </p><p>foreign assistance that can be raised for reconstructing </p><p>and repairing the war devastation in both the North and the </p><p>East."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"Whether the news from Washington and Tokyo that the major </p><p>donor conference to be hosted in mid-June by the Japanese </p><p>government will be held regardless of LTTE participation </p><p>will nudge the Tigers to abandon their hard line and attend </p><p>the meeting remains to be seen. There is no doubt that the </p><p>absence of the LTTE from this meeting, showcased to both </p><p>Sri Lanka and the world as an event where the pledging of </p><p>some serious money is assured, will rob the event of some </p><p>of its glamour. But it is not going to scuttle it </p><p>altogether as the LTTE, now playing a dangerous game of </p><p>brinkmanship, seems to expect. This became unmistakably </p><p>clear on Friday. </p><p>"The Tigers understand international pressure very well. </p><p>That, together with the war weariness of the people they </p><p>claim to represent, is what encouraged them in the first </p><p>place to sign the cease-fire agreement and sit at the </p><p>negotiating table with Colombo\'s representatives. </p><p>"The U.S. State Department said on Friday that Deputy </p><p>Secretary Armitage was attending the Tokyo meeting. In </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>language that was clearly unambiguous, the State </p><p>Department\'s spokesman repeated the dates - June 9 and 10 - </p><p>and the venue adding that Armitage looked forward to </p><p>discussing reconstruction and rehabilitation assistance to </p><p>Sri Lanka at the conference. The high ranking official was </p><p>quoted saying that this event was important for the </p><p>international community, enabling it to "demonstrate its </p><p>solid support for the peace process and its full commitment </p><p>to contribute to the reconstruction and development of all </p><p>regions of the country, including the North and East, which </p><p>have been devastated by nearly 20 years of conflict." </p><p>"Washington intends to back up its statement with letters </p><p>to some 60 countries about the importance of the Tokyo </p><p>meeting and the need for their attendance and support. </p><p>Obviously if the world community did not believe that there </p><p>was a genuine possibility of working out a durable peace </p><p>here, they would not be devoting their time, energy and </p><p>money in backing the effort. That is why the LTTE, seeking </p><p>to extract the last ounce of possible advantage for itself, </p><p>has adopted its present strategy. Given the ease with which </p><p>it extracted other concessions like having Colombo lift its </p><p>proscription on the Tigers and the softening of their </p><p>stance by some countries where the LTTE is outlawed, </p><p>Prabhakaran and Balasingham may well have believed that </p><p>there is more to get. The run-up to Tokyo was obviously the </p><p>best time to grab what they can and that\'s the way the game </p><p>is now being played. The interim administration for the </p><p>northeast dominated by themselves is clearly the immediate </p><p>objective. </p><p>"The people of Sri Lanka have already enjoyed some benefits </p><p>of peace in the fifteen months since the gun went silent. </p><p>But the economic dividends have been slow in coming. </p><p>Colombo has built up massive expectations that this would </p><p>change post-Tokyo and the signals from abroad tended to </p><p>support that view. Apart from the U.S. position that the </p><p>Tokyo meeting must be held as scheduled, "notwithstanding </p><p>the LTTE\'s stated position not to participate," the arrest </p><p>in Thailand of some Tiger arms smugglers and the whip </p><p>cracking by the Thai prime minister that followed must also </p><p>send a message to the Tiger hierarchy that they are now </p><p>sailing very close to the wind. </p><p>"Now that it\'s clear that the Tokyo meeting will be held, </p><p>with or without the LTTE, they must also remember that </p><p>pledges can also get diverted for flood relief in the south </p><p>if they are absent from that forum when how the funds </p><p>pledged will be utilized. Undoubtedly, flood relief too is </p><p>badly needed but rebuilding the infrastructure in the </p><p>northeast will still command greater donor focus if the </p><p>case is properly presented. If the Tigers really feel for </p><p>their people, their duty lies in maximizing foreign </p><p>assistance that can be raised for reconstructing and </p><p>repairing the war devastation in both the North and the </p><p>East. Losing out there by default will be criminal folly." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
