<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001005 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, CASC, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT AIRWAYS PREPARES FOR WAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 00806 </p><p>     B. STATE 71829 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY. In the face of a potential US-led attack on Iraq </p><p>and any retaliatory strikes, Kuwait Airways Corporation (KAC) </p><p>unveiled its emergency plan, which includes reduced flights </p><p>and the possibility of relocating operations to Dubai. </p><p>Officials at Kuwait International Airport will continue to </p><p>maintain operations unless military action jeopardizes the </p><p>safety of civilian flights (ref A), but KAC and other </p><p>carriers have developed contingency plans that involve </p><p>transporting passengers overland to airports in neighboring </p><p>countries.  Additional safety measures are being taken at </p><p>Kuwait\'s airport ahead of any crisis.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>KAC EMERGENCY PLAN </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. Fawaz Al-Farah, Deputy Director General for Aviation </p><p>Safety and Air Transport at Kuwait\'s Directorate General of </p><p>Civil Aviation (DGCA), told EconOff March 16, 2003, that KAC </p><p>submitted an emergency plan in the event that Kuwait </p><p>International Airport is forced to halt civilian operations. </p><p>Al-Farah reiterated that the airport plans to remain open as </p><p>long as possible, closing only if allied attacks from Kuwait, </p><p>Iraqi counterattacks, or terrorist activity make it too </p><p>dangerous to continue civilian flights. </p><p> </p><p>3. KAC conferred and coordinated with DGCA and Kuwait\'s Civil </p><p>Defense Department to design its emergency plan.  The plan\'s </p><p>main component involves KAC relocating its base of operations </p><p>to Dubai, in nearby United Arab Emirates, until it is safe to </p><p>resume flights from Kuwait.  In this arrangement, KAC would </p><p>limit its departures to four or five destinations, including </p><p>Bombay, Cairo, Jedda, and London.  Passengers traveling to </p><p>other places, such as the United States or Western Europe, </p><p>would need to make connecting flights. </p><p> </p><p>4. On March 14, KAC Board Chairman Ahmad Al-Zaben told </p><p>Kuwaiti news agency KUNA that KAC plans to continue operating </p><p>most of its flights.  With the possible onset of hostilities, </p><p>however, KAC is among those airlines in the Middle East that </p><p>has started curtailing some of its commercial flights (ref </p><p>B).  These routes include two direct flights to Chicago, </p><p>three to London, and four each to Frankfurt, New York, Paris, </p><p>and Rome, in addition to other flights outside Europe and the </p><p>United States. </p><p> </p><p>5. Al-Zaben said that KAC has devised plans to address </p><p>critical conditions and secure safety of passengers during </p><p>flights, as well as helping them transit by land to Dubai or </p><p>an alternate location near Kuwait, if necessary.  Al-Farah </p><p>said that DGCA has requested from KAC details on specific </p><p>arrangements for transporting passengers overland, as well as </p><p>any special visa arrangements.  He was told that KAC was </p><p>finalizing its plans and would reveal them soon. </p><p> </p><p>6. While KAC has the largest staff and operates the most </p><p>flights out of Kuwait, it is not alone.  Other carriers, such </p><p>as British Airways, KLM, and  Lufthansa, continue to operate </p><p>at mostly full or slightly reduced schedules (ref A). </p><p>Al-Farah said each individual carrier must decide whether to </p><p>continue flights from Kuwait and will be responsible for </p><p>ensuring its passengers reach alternate destination sites. </p><p> </p><p>7. Al-Zaben said KAC may be forced to slightly raise airline </p><p>fares due to increased insurance and fuel costs, but would </p><p>keep ticket hikes within the minimum range and not try to </p><p>gouge anxious passengers.  In an effort to offset any </p><p>increases, KAC Director General Shaykh Talal Mubarak Al-Sabah </p><p>told the press March 14 that "KAC has decided to cut </p><p>operation costs to meet the demands of lower income groups" </p><p>who might want to leave Kuwait in the time of emergency. </p><p>DGCA\'s Al-Farah said his office has not yet received requests </p><p>from any of the air carriers to increase ticket prices. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>AIRPORT OPERATIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. Al-Farah said overall operations of Kuwait\'s airport will </p><p>depend on a given situation.  He admitted it was possible </p><p>that all civilian operations would cease in a time of crisis </p><p>and only military flights would originate from Kuwait.  He </p><p>added that KAC and other carriers have plans to scatter or </p><p>remove their aircraft from the runway should word come of an </p><p>imminent missile attack from Iraq.  If the airport closes, </p><p>KAC will immediately vacate its jets to Dubai, Al-Farah said. </p><p> </p><p>9. In the event of an attack, the airport has provisions to </p><p>shelter its personnel and any passengers on the premises.  An </p><p>extensive basement under the airport grounds has been </p><p>prepared and equipped with food, water, and first aid kits. </p><p>Gas masks are available for all staff members but not yet for </p><p>the general public.  Al-Farah said a massive review of the </p><p>airport\'s fire fighting system was conducted last year, </p><p>following a large-scale fire at the airport in August. </p><p>Airport staff have been put through several training sessions </p><p>and provided detailed instructions in case of emergency. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. Post plans to keep in regular contact with DGCA and has </p><p>asked Al-Farah to alert us of any new developments in the </p><p>operations of Kuwait Airways Corporation or Kuwait </p><p>International Airport. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
