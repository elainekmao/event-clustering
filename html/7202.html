<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000647 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DOT ALSO FOR FAA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, EAID, EINV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CONSULTANTS CONCERNED ABOUT AVIATION </p><p>SAFETY </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary. Aviation consultants sponsored by </p><p>the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) </p><p>recently completed an evaluation of the Nigerian Civil </p><p>Aviation Authority\'s (NCAA) efforts to improve its </p><p>safety oversight. They found few improvements since a </p><p>2001 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) </p><p>safety audit.  Nigeria needs to implement the </p><p>recommendations quickly to be prepared for another </p><p>ICAO inspection in May 2003.  The main concern remains </p><p>lack of legislation granting the NCAA Director General </p><p>autonomy over safety issues.  Nigeria risks receiving </p><p>another poor safety audit, which could hamper its </p><p>efforts to attain Category I certification.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Four FAA-sponsored private aviation </p><p>consultants came to Nigeria in March to evaluate </p><p>NCAA\'s progress toward implementing safety </p><p>recommendations resulting from a 2001 ICAO inspection </p><p>and a 2002 FAA advisory visit.  In its 2001 report, </p><p>ICAO had voiced concern that "a large segment" of </p><p>Nigeria\'s aviation sector was not complying with </p><p>international safety standards.  Last month, the FAA </p><p>consultants discovered that few of the ICAO </p><p>recommendations had been implemented although many are </p><p>said to be "in progress."  To help the NCAA prepare </p><p>itself for another ICAO inspection, the consultants </p><p>are designing a work plan that may receive FAA </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Next month\'s ICAO inspection will be an </p><p>important test of Nigeria\'s ability to pass a FAA </p><p>Category I inspection, as FAA and ICAO safety </p><p>regulations are based on the same standards.  For more </p><p>than a year, Nigeria has been pursuing Category I </p><p>certification, a designation that would permit its </p><p>crews and aircraft to fly to the United States. </p><p>Ethiopia, Ghana, and South Africa are the only three </p><p>sub-Saharan African countries certified.  Nigeria\'s </p><p>securing the top safety ranking would boost its </p><p>aviation industry and help position Lagos as a </p><p>regional hub. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) While progress has been made toward that end, </p><p>several hurdles remain.  The major one is lack of </p><p>legislation granting the NCAA Director General (DG) </p><p>autonomy over safety issues.  Under current law and </p><p>practice, the Minister of Aviation retains final say </p><p>on safety matters.  According to NCAA staff, the </p><p>Minister has overruled the DG\'s orders to ground </p><p>aircraft for safety violations on several occasions </p><p>when the offending airline was politically well </p><p>connected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Action on legislation granting independence </p><p>to the NCAA has been pending for months at the </p><p>Ministry of Justice.  Following ministerial approval </p><p>of the bill, it will be sent to the National Assembly. </p><p>To ensure that its provisions comply with </p><p>international standards, the FAA consultants sent </p><p>Aviation Minister Kema Chikwe a memo on </p><p>March 13 specifying provisions to make NCAA </p><p>autonomous. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Even if a law were enacted granting NCAA </p><p>autonomy, Nigeria might still not pass an FAA </p><p>inspection because Nigeria lacks certified cabin and </p><p>operation safety inspectors.  Its aviation inspection </p><p>office is understaffed, and its few inspectors are not </p><p>certified internationally to conduct inspections of </p><p>the most common aircraft operating in country.  During </p><p>a March visit to Abuja, Kevin Sample, Senior DOT </p><p>Advisor, told Minister Chikwe that the USG can provide </p><p>training to remedy this deficiency.  Such training </p><p>would be desirable since the FAA consultants have </p><p>suggested that the DG be allowed to approve necessary </p><p>training.  All training requests require the </p><p>Minister\'s approval.  On several occasions, employees </p><p>were unable to secure timely approval and consequently </p><p>could not enroll in desired courses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Besides identifying the major hurdles - lack </p><p>of an independent NCAA and qualified inspectors - the </p><p>FAA consultants highlighted NCAA organizational </p><p>deficiencies that weaken its ability to provide </p><p>effective safety oversight.  Among their chief </p><p>concerns are the NCAA\'s lack of financial resources </p><p>and inefficient use of personnel.  While the NCAA </p><p>charges various user fees, these funds go straight to </p><p>the federal treasury; consequently, the NCAA relies on </p><p>Ministry of Aviation budget allocations. To ensure </p><p>adequate funding for oversight, the FAA consultants </p><p>proposed that NCAA have access to budgetary funds </p><p>without ministerial approval.  With respect to </p><p>personnel, the consultants concluded that Nigeria\'s </p><p>aviation authority employs more people than necessary. </p><p>Some of the excess staff, whom the NCAA is obligated </p><p>to employ, are the Minister\'s appointees. (Comment. </p><p>This problem is not unique to the Aviation Ministry. </p><p>The GON suffers from excess personnel across the </p><p>board.  Regarding funding, the Minister is unlikely to </p><p>relinquish financial control, especially if she is </p><p>forced to transfer safety oversight to the DG.  End </p><p>Comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Nigeria\'s slow progress toward implementing </p><p>the recommendations of the 2001 ICAO inspection, even </p><p>with FAA technical assistance, is disconcerting. </p><p>While the Minister and the NCAA regularly express </p><p>their hopes of attaining Category I certification, </p><p>they have little to show to warrant such action.  Why </p><p>so few recommendations have been implemented is </p><p>unclear. Limited institutional capacity, lack of </p><p>training, and an inadequate budget all partly explain </p><p>the reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The Minister herself is not beyond reproach. </p><p>She insists on maintaining tight control over all </p><p>civil aviation activities, from granting landing </p><p>rights to deciding who can hold placards for arriving </p><p>passengers at Murtala Muhammed International Airport </p><p>in Lagos. Her untimely approval of training requests </p><p>is an example of how her unwillingness to delegate </p><p>authority hampers the NCAA\'s effectiveness. It will be </p><p>interesting to see if the incumbent Minister returns </p><p>should Obasanjo win reelection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) But the largest hurdle remains lack of </p><p>legislation granting NCAA autonomy over safety issues, </p><p>a problem that USG assistance cannot resolve. </p><p>Considering that the National Assembly\'s attention is </p><p>firmly focused on the April 19 national elections, a </p><p>law is unlikely to be passed soon that would permit </p><p>Nigeria to attain Category I status anytime in the </p><p>near future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
