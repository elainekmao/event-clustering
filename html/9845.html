<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  VATICAN 003497 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE MENNUTI AND NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: TAKING THE VATICAN TO TASK ON CRITICISM OF U.S. </p><p>POLICY TOWARD MUSLIM WORLD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Jim Nicholson:  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Following a post-Iraq war interview in which the </p><p>Vatican\'s senior official for inter-religious dialogue had </p><p>suggested the Administration\'s language during the Iraq war </p><p>could have created a conviction in the Muslim world that the </p><p>war was a war of religion, the Ambassador challenged the </p><p>official to justify this assertion and outlined USG efforts </p><p>to reach out to the Muslim world since September 11. </p><p>Archbishop Michael Fitzgerald, President of the Council for </p><p>Inter-religious Dialogue, acknowledged that his statement had </p><p>been inaccurate, but defended it as a reflection of views he </p><p>had heard from his contacts in the Muslim world.  Fitzgerald </p><p>welcomed U.S. initiatives to engage the Muslim world, and </p><p>agreed on the importance of working together to overcome </p><p>perceived divisions rather than add to them. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Setting the Record Straight on U.S.-Muslim Relations </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Archbishop Michael Fitzgerald, President of the </p><p>Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue -- the </p><p>Vatican dicastry responsible for relations with the Muslim </p><p>world -- had sharply criticized the Administration\'s language </p><p>and tone in conducting the Iraq war in a late April </p><p>interview, asserting that alleged references to God and </p><p>messianic tones would "boost the impression in Muslim world </p><p>that the war taking place is a war of religion."  He further </p><p>suggested that many Christian leaders in the U.S. had "marked </p><p>their distance from President Bush on account of the language </p><p>he uses."  Following this interview, the Ambassador had </p><p>written Fitzgerald requesting an opportunity to discuss the </p><p>prelate\'s misperceptions. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Meeting with Fitzgerald July 22, Ambassador Nicholson </p><p>challenged Fitzgerald\'s statements, pointing out that the </p><p>President had neither invoked God\'s name to justify war nor </p><p>employed messianic language that would in any way suggest </p><p>that the Iraq war should be seen as a religious struggle.  On </p><p>the contrary, the Ambassador pointed out that the President </p><p>had gone out of his way to reach out to the Muslim world and </p><p>to emphasize America\'s respect for the Muslim faith and </p><p>Muslim people.  He recalled the President\'s post-September 11 </p><p>visit to the Washington mosque, his hosting of Iftaar </p><p>dinners, and meetings with Muslim leaders.  He also pointed </p><p>out that the U.S. has repeatedly acted in defense of and to </p><p>provide liberty to Muslim populations in Kuwait, Bosnia, and </p><p>Afghanistan and Iraq.  The Ambassador emphasized that </p><p>statements such as this from the Holy See could be seen as an </p><p>affirmation by extremists for their critical views of the </p><p>U.S.  Given that the U.S. and Holy See were both seeking to </p><p>overcome perceptions of division between the West and the </p><p>Muslim world, the Ambassador concluded, Fitzgerald\'s </p><p>statement "really sets us back." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Fitzgerald acknowledged the inaccuracy of his </p><p>statements and the potential for misunderstanding they could </p><p>generate.  At the same time, he expressed his strong </p><p>objection to the U.S. characterization of Iran, Iraq, and </p><p>North Korea as an "axis of evil," saying he did not regard </p><p>the people of those countries as evil.  The Ambassador </p><p>pointed out that the term referred to the oppressive </p><p>governments of those countries, and not the people who </p><p>suffered under them.  While begrudgingly acknowledging the </p><p>Ambassador\'s point, Fitzgerald asserted that people in those </p><p>countries nevertheless felt they were being branded as evil. </p><p>Fitzgerald further defended his comments as reflective of </p><p>comments he has heard from many in the Muslim world, noting </p><p>that whether or not the perceptions reflected the reality of </p><p>U.S. policy, they did exist.  He also noted that vituperative </p><p>criticism of the Muslim world by leading Christian voices in </p><p>the U.S. seen as close to the Administration had strengthened </p><p>this perception and "damned the USG by association." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Pope\'s Statements Defused Religious Clash </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Regarding broader relations between Christians and </p><p>Muslims, Fitzgerald indicated that the Pope\'s opposition to </p><p>war actually helped minimize the perception of division </p><p>between the Christian and Muslim faiths, making clear that </p><p>Christianity and the West are not one and the same.  He </p><p>believes the Pope\'s statements were instrumental in </p><p>convincing many in the Muslim world that the war was not an </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>attack on Islam. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Working Together to Overcome Divisions </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador emphasized the U.S. commitment to </p><p>improving relations with Muslim countries and indicated that </p><p>he believed the U.S. and Holy See could both advance our </p><p>shared goals by better coordinating our outreach efforts. </p><p>The Ambassador outlined Embassy planning for a cultural event </p><p>in the next year that would seek to bring together Christian, </p><p>Muslim, and Jewish performers, and suggested that this could </p><p>offer a vehicle for additional engagement.  Fitzgerald </p><p>welcomed this initiative and agreed to consider how to expand </p><p>Muslim participation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Vatican-Muslim Dialogue Still Lacking Partners </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Turning to recent activities of Fitzgerald\'s Council, </p><p>the Ambassador inquired about the status of the Holy See\'s </p><p>outreach activities to the Muslim world.  Fitzgerald pointed </p><p>out that Muslim leaders had opted out of a recent meeting in </p><p>Damascus, leaving Christian leaders from Muslim countries to </p><p>discuss the state of relations among themselves. </p><p>Acknowledging his frustrations, Fitzgerald observed that </p><p>"unfortunately the Holy See does not choose its own partners </p><p>(who are often selected by governments and are often not </p><p>religious leaders).  He also noted that Muslims who </p><p>participate in dialogue with the Holy See are often </p><p>criticized at home. On the plus side, Fitzgerald observed </p><p>that the Holy See and its Muslim partners have been able to </p><p>address issues that they would not have been able to talk </p><p>about a few years ago, such as the situation of Christians in </p><p>Muslim-majority countries.  He welcomed recent developments </p><p>in Qatar where the Emir has expressed interest in developing </p><p>an institute for Christian-Muslim dialogue.  Likewise in </p><p>Asia, there will be a meeting in Subic Bay in the Philippines </p><p>between Catholic bishops and Muslim leaders that Fitzgerald </p><p>would attend, and which he expected would generate a healthy </p><p>dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Archbishop Fitzgerald\'s original comments reflect the </p><p>unfortunate tendency among some Vatican prelates who take on </p><p>board and pass along impressions gleaned from the European </p><p>media without checking their facts or drawing distinctions </p><p>between official U.S. policy and positions of other groups </p><p>and voices within American society.  Following this </p><p>discussion and the extensive information we provided </p><p>Fitzgerald about U.S. outreach to the Muslim world, we expect </p><p>he will be more circumspect in future public pronouncements </p><p>and could be a useful ally in inter-religious initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>Nicholson </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA03497 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
