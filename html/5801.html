<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000213 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>CDR PACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BANKS CRASH </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RANGOON 0030 </p><p>     B. 02 RANGOON 0938 </p><p>     C. 02 RANGOON 0554 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA, a.i. Ron McMullen.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Burma\'s expected banking crisis is no longer </p><p>pending; it\'s here.  According to bankers in Rangoon, </p><p>depositors withdrew more than one-quarter of their deposits </p><p>with Burma\'s private banks during the week ending February </p><p>14, following revelations of connections between the private </p><p>banks and a set of unofficial financial institutions which </p><p>collapsed en masse at the end of January.  The banks have </p><p>imposed restrictions on withdrawals and appealed to the </p><p>government through Secretary 1 for support.  Indications are </p><p>that the government will step in with the supply of needed </p><p>liquidity, but, as of close of business February 19, no plan </p><p>commensurate with the problem had yet been announced.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The long expected crisis in the Burmese banking sector </p><p>(reftels) hit last week.   Martin Pun, the General Manager of </p><p>one of Burma\'s largest private banks (Yoma Bank), told the </p><p>DCM on February 16 that depositors had withdrawn more than a </p><p>quarter of their deposits with Burma\'s private banks during </p><p>the week ending February 14.  According to Pun, a total of </p><p>some 70 billion kyat (about USD 70 million) was withdrawn, </p><p>with 19 billion kyat going out the doors on February 14 </p><p>alone.  Hardest hit was Asia Wealth Bank (AWB), the largest </p><p>of Burma\'s private banks.  Over the weekend, private banks </p><p>met and agreed to place concerted limits on all withdrawals. </p><p>Starting February 17, all private banks will allow </p><p>withdrawals of only 500,000 kyat/week from checking and </p><p>savings accounts.  They also appealed to Secretary 1 for </p><p>central bank support and an effective government guarantee of </p><p>all deposits in the private banks.  Reportedly, the </p><p>government has agreed to provide support, but has not yet </p><p>issued a public announcement regarding its plans.  Meanwhile, </p><p>concerns remain as to whether banks will be able to meet the </p><p>public\'s demand for cash as the week goes on. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Behind all of these developments was the collapse at </p><p>the end of January of several unofficial financial </p><p>institutions (Arrow, Aye Yar Myay, Ngwe Zone, Kahing Marlar, </p><p>and others) who took loans and deposits against promises of </p><p>returns of 5 to 10 percent/month.  These institutions had </p><p>flourished by investing in real assets during the high </p><p>inflation days of 2001 and 2002, but had been caught out by </p><p>tighter government enforcement of banking rules, the </p><p>stabilization of the kyat over the past 6 months at a rate of </p><p>about 1,100 kyat/dollar, and a flattening out of the asset </p><p>price inflation which had carried them to profits during the </p><p>previous two years.  No longer able to deliver the returns </p><p>they promised, these institutions either folded or, in the </p><p>case of the few that still remain standing, unilaterally </p><p>placed restrictions on payments out. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Unfortunately for the private banks, several of these </p><p>unofficial financial institutions were their clients.  In </p><p>particular, Arrow was affiliated with AWB, and its collapse </p><p>precipitated the run, first on AWB, then on all the private </p><p>banks.  The run started slowly at the beginning of February, </p><p>but rapidly gained momentum, cresting on February 14.  Even </p><p>now there are signs that the panic is not over.  On February </p><p>17 and 18, there were crowds at several banks and others (AWB </p><p>and Myanmar Universal Bank) had effectively closed to the </p><p>public and gone to an appointment system for depositors </p><p>seeking funds.  While there has been no serious violence as </p><p>yet, public frustration is building.  On February 18 and 19, </p><p>in fact, there were reports of stone-throwing at several </p><p>locations. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) As yet, however, it is still not clear who the public </p><p>will hold responsible for this fiasco.  In some ways, of </p><p>course, the government is obviously to blame.  It created the </p><p>repressed financial system and rip-roaring inflation that set </p><p>the conditions for the growth of the unofficial financial </p><p>institutions that have now collapsed.  It also licensed many </p><p>of those companies, albeit not for banking operations.   In </p><p>addition, it was obviously lax in its supervision of the </p><p>banks, who were allowed to lend freely (and imprudently) to </p><p>companies involved in blatantly illegal operations.  Finally, </p><p>its response to the crisis has left a lot to be desired. </p><p>Even as of close of business on February 18; i.e., three </p><p>weeks after the start of the run, the government had still </p><p>not issued any public statement re-assuring depositors or </p><p>guaranteeing financial support for the banks. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) That said, the private banks will not escape blame. </p><p>When all is said and done, they did the dirty work.  They </p><p>were the ones who took deposits in good faith and then lent </p><p>those deposits on to companies whose operations were not even </p><p>legal, much less viable in the long term.  They may also be </p><p>the ones who pay the highest price for this fiasco.  If they </p><p>survive at all, they will end up propped up by government </p><p>money and dependent on the government for their continued </p><p>survival.  They may also be obliged to endure much closer </p><p>government supervision of their management of funds, which </p><p>could be embarrassing for many of the private bank managers. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) It also remains to be seen what impact this crisis </p><p>will have on real output and prices in Burma.  Restricted </p><p>credit should hit both, but if the government steps in to </p><p>meet the liquidity needs of the private banks, we could see a </p><p>sharp fall in the exchange rate (as cash holders move their </p><p>withdrawn funds offshore) and a spike in the inflation rate, </p><p>depending on how quickly and completely the government makes </p><p>up for the banks\' lost deposits.  However, even that effect </p><p>may be muted, if the government trails the rate of </p><p>withdrawals (as it should), forces some banks out of business </p><p>(like AWB) and encourages the rest to clean up their lending </p><p>acts.  Added to this will be the impact of the collapse of </p><p>the unofficial financial institutions whose operations </p><p>assumed huge proportions over the past three years. </p><p>Reportedly, those institutions ran up assets and liabilities </p><p>totaling over 200 billion kyat over the past three years. </p><p>Now, with their collapse, that whole unofficial credit </p><p>creation system will be wiped away.  That alone will have an </p><p>impact on prices and output in Burma, regardless of how well </p><p>or badly the government handles the banking crisis. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
