<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 DAMASCUS 04736 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR MILLIKAN </p><p>PARIS FOR ROSENBLATT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL PGOV SY LE IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  SYRIA AND THE IQLIM AL TUFFAH FIGHTING </p><p> </p><p>REF:   A)  FBIS NC2907093290 </p><p>       B)  DAMASCUS 03433 </p><p>       C)  FBIS  NC3007112690 </p><p>       D)  DAMASCUS </p><p>       E)  FBIS NC 2607110790 </p><p>       F)  DAMASCUS 4694 </p><p>       G)  NICOSIA 4983 </p><p>       H)  FBIS  NC2907184290 </p><p>       I)  NICOSIA 04992 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  DAMASCUS HAS ADOPTED A LOW PUBLIC PROFILE ON </p><p>THE AMAL-HIZBALLAH FIGHTING IN THE IQLIM AL TUFFAH, </p><p>DESPITE ITS INTENSITY AND POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES.  SYRIAN </p><p>MEDIA HAS GIVEN LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE BATTLES AND THE </p><p>SARG APPEARS TO BE TAKING FEW, IF ANY, STEPS TO TRY TO </p><p>END IT.  THE FLURRY OF PUBLIC DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY BETWEEN </p><p>DAMASCUS AND TEHRAN, WHICH FOLLOWED PREVIOUS CLASHES </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO SHIA\' MILITIAS HAS NOT OCCURRED.  UNLIKE </p><p>ITS IRANIAN COUNTERPARTS, THE SARG HAS NOT CALLED FOR A </p><p>CEASE-FIRE AMONG THE COMBATANTS.  DAMASCUS IS SUPPORTING </p><p>THE INTERVENTION OF THE LEBANESE ARMY INTO THE AREA, BUT </p><p>PROBABLY ALSO REALIZES THE LAF CAN DO LITTLE TO STOP THE </p><p>FIGHTING WITHOUT THE ACQUIESCENCE OF BOTH AMAL AND </p><p>HIZBALLAH.  INTERESTINGLY, AN ARTICLE IN AN NAHAR, AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT WEST BEIRUT NEWSPAPER, PORTRAYED THE FIGHTING </p><p>AS AN "UNDECLARED WAR" BETWEEN SYRIA AND IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>DAMASCUS UNCONCERNED? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DAMASCUS HAS PAID LITTLE PUBLIC ATTENTION IN THE </p><p>MEDIA TO THE FIGHTING THUS FAR, FOCUSING INSTEAD ON THE </p><p>HRAWI GOVERNMENT\'S JULY 11 PLAN TO IMPLEMENT TA\'IF.  THE </p><p>SARG HAS TAKEN NO STEPS AIMED AT HALTING THE FIGHTING. </p><p>EVEN THOUGH, THE FIGHTING IS IN AN AREA OF LEBANON WHERE </p><p>THERE IS NO CONCENTRATION OF SYRIAN TROOPS, DAMASCUS AND </p><p>TEHRAN HAVE BROKERED CEASE-FIRES BETWEEN AMAL AND </p><p>HIZBALLAH PREVIOUSLY.  DAMASCUS PROBABLY DOES PERCEIVE AN </p><p>INTEREST IN STEMMING HIZBALLAH\'S ROLE AND ANY GROWTH IN </p><p>INFLUENCE AS A RESULT OF THE FIGHTING.  IRANIAN FORMIN </p><p>VELAYATI CLAIMED IN HIS LETTER TO LEBANESE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>HUSS (REF A) THAT IRAN HAS BEEN IN CONTINUOUS CONTACT AND </p><p>CONSULTATION WITH THE SARG, BUT EMBASSY DAMASCUS HAS </p><p>NOTED A LACK OF PUBLIC DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY.  WE HAVE </p><p>DETECTED NO SHUTTLING OF IRANIAN OR SYRIAN DIPLOMATS </p><p>BETWEEN THE CAPITALS OR INTO LEBANON TO TALK WITH AMAL </p><p>AND HIZBALLAH OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  EMBASSY HAS ALSO DETECTED NO ATTEMPT BY THE SARG </p><p>TO STOP THE FLOW OF ARMS TO THE COMBATANTS.  PRESS </p><p>ACCOUNTS INDICATE THAT SOME OF DAMASCUS\' OTHER LEBANESE </p><p>SURROGATES, SUCH AS ELIE HUBAYQA, ARE ASSISTING AMAL, </p><p>WHICH PROBABLY INCLUDES SUPPLYING ARMS.  IF THE SYRIANS </p><p>CAN PREVENT THEIR PROXIES FROM SUPPLYING GENERAL AWN AT A </p><p>MOMENT\'S NOTICE (REF D), THEY ALMOST CERTAINLY COULD </p><p>EXERT THE SAME INFLUENCE ON THEIR PROXIES WHO ARE </p><p>SUPPLYING AMAL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  DAMASCUS IS ALSO VOID OF ANY RUMORS HINTING THAT </p><p>THE SYRIANS MAY HAVE CLOSED THE BORDER TO LEBANON TO SHUT </p><p>DOWN THE THE IRANIAN PIPELINE TO HIZBALLAH OR STOPPED THE </p><p>FLOW OF ARMS FROM THE BIQA\' TO THE SOUTH.  CONTROL OF </p><p>THESE PIPELINES ARE THE SARG\'S PRINCIPAL LEVERAGE OVER </p><p>THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS AND HIZBALLAH AND ONE </p><p>THEY HAVE USED DURING PREVIOUS CLASHES BETWEEN AMAL AND </p><p>HIZBALLAH.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, DAMASCUS SHUT THE LEBANESE </p><p>BORDER TO THE IRANIANS IN PART TO PROTEST IRAN\'S </p><p>SUPPLYING OF ARMS TO HIZBALLAH.  WHEN THE SARG REOPENED </p><p>IT, IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS AND THEIR SUPPLIES </p><p>ENTERED LEBANON UNDER TIGHTER CONTROLS (REF B).  UNDER </p><p>THESE CONDITIONS, THE SYRIANS SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT IS </p><p>CROSSING THE BORDER INTO LEBANON.  (COMMENT:  BECAUSE OF </p><p>ITS CONTROL OVER THE PIPELINE, THE SARG MAY NOT HAVE BEEN </p><p>CAUGHT TOTALLY OFF GUARD BY THE OUTBREAK OF FIGHTING </p><p>SEVERAL WEEKS LATER, REALIZING THAT HIZBALLAH HAD BEEN </p><p>RESUPPLIED.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE SARG HAS ALSO ALLOWED ITS ALLY, AMAL LEADER </p><p>NABIH BERRI TO PUBLICLY CALL FOR THE REMOVAL OF IRANIAN </p><p>FORCES FROM LEBANON.  BERRI HAS MADE SEVERAL STATEMENTS </p><p>OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS REITERATING THIS POINT </p><p>WITH LITTLE DETECTABLE REACTION FROM THE SARG.  AMAL </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE ACCUSED IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS OF </p><p>PARTICIPATING IN THE FIGHTING AND HAVE EVEN BLAMED THEM </p><p>FOR ESCALATING IT (REF C). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>WHAT DAMASCUS HAS DONE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE SARG HAS ANNOUNCED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>INTERVENTION OF THE LEBANESE ARMY (LAF) INTO THE IQLIM AL </p><p>TUFFAH IN ORDER TO HALT THE FIGHTING (REF F).  LEBANESE </p><p>ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL LAHUD WAS IN DAMASCUS OVER THE </p><p>WEEKEND MEETING WITH GENERAL SHIHABI, ACCORDING TO </p><p>LEBANESE PRESS REPORTS (REF G).  THE PLAN TO INTERVENE IN </p><p>THE IQLIM FIGHTING PROBABLY WAS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, </p><p>ESPECIALLY SINCE THE LAF HAS FEW TROOPS AND WOULD BE HARD </p><p>PRESSED TO GET INVOLVED BOTH IN THE IQLIM AND AID IN THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JULY 11 PLAN IN BEIRUT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>AN "UNDECLARED WAR" </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  AN NAHAR, AN INDEPENDENT WEST BEIRUT NEWSPAPER, </p><p>PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE ON JULY 25 ENTITLED "THE IQLIM AL </p><p>TUFFAH WAR IS BETWEEN SYRIA AND IRAN" (REF E).  THE </p><p>ARTICLE QUOTED SOURCES CLOSE TO DAMASCUS AS SAYING "THE </p><p>FIGHTING...BETWEEN \'HIZBALLAH\' AND \'THE AMAL MOVEMENT\' IN </p><p>IQLIM AL TUFFAH...IS ACTUALLY AN UNDECLARED WAR BETWEEN </p><p>THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN AND SYRIA."  THE SYRIAN </p><p>SOURCES BASED THIS CLAIM ON THREE FACTORS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE FAILURE OF AN INDIRECT AGREEMENT BETWEEN IRAN AND </p><p>THE U.S., WHICH HAD BEEN BROKERED BY SYRIAN FORMIN </p><p>SHARA\', EARLIER THIS YEAR; </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAN\'S FEARS OF THE INCREASING PROSPECTS FOR ARAB </p><p>RECONCILIATION; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- HIZBALLAH AND IRAN\'S FEARS THAT THEY WILL BE LEFT OUT </p><p>OF THE PLANNING FOR LEBANON\'S FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE ARTICLE ALSO PRESENTS THE IRANIAN VIEWS ON </p><p>WHAT LED TO THE ABOVE PROBLEMS.  THE IRANIAN SOURCES </p><p>BELIEVE THE SYRIAN SPONSORED US-IRANIAN AGREEMENT FAILED </p><p>BECAUSE OF "DAMASCUS\' CONNIVANCE WITH WASHINGTON" AND </p><p>DAMASCUS \'S FALLING INTO THE U.S. TRAP AND ITS (DAMASCUS) </p><p>IGNORANCE OF THE FACT THAT "U.S. POLICY TOWARD THE </p><p>IRANIAN ISLAMIC REVOLUTION...HAS NOT CHANGED."  SYRIA\'S </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT WITH EGYPT AND THE NEVERENDING ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>RECONCILE SYRIA AND IRAQ TRIGGERED THE SECOND IRANIAN </p><p>FEAR.  THE JULY 11 PLAN\'S EXCLUSION OF THE SOUTHERN </p><p>SUBURBS UNTIL "ALL OBSTACLES, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH </p><p>ARE THE FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENTS, ARE OVERCOME" </p><p>HEIGHTENED THE LAST IRANIAN CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE, IT WAS THE IRANIAN </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST ANALYSIS OF THE SYRIAN STAND CONCERNING </p><p>LEBANON THAT "PROMPTED THEM (IRAN AND HIZBALLAH) TO </p><p>ESCALATE THE WAR IN THE IQLIM AL -TUFFAH WHERE SYRIA HAS </p><p>NO DIRECT PRESENCE AND WHERE ITS ALLIES CAN NOT STAND </p><p>ALONE AND ... WIN."  THE ARTICLE STATES THE AIM OF THE </p><p>FIGHTING IS TO SEIZE CONTROL OF TERRITORY AND MAKE IRAN </p><p>AND ITS ALLIES HEARD IN LEBANON AND THE REGION. </p><p>(COMMENT:  LEBANESE PRESS HAS REPORTED THAT DAMASCUS HAS </p><p>ASKED THE TRIPARTITE COMMITTEE TO INCLUDE HIZBALLAH IN </p><p>THE EXPANDED LEBANESE CABINET.  THE SARG DID SPECIFY, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT HIZBALLAH MUST FIRST ACCEPT TA\'IF.  IN </p><p>OTHER WORDS, SARG IS DEMANDING THAT HIZBALLAH AND GENERAL </p><p>AWN LIVE UP TO THE SAME CONDITIONS -- AN UNLIKELY </p><p>EVENT.)  (REF I) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  DAMASCUS PROBABLY WILL MAINTAIN ITS PUBLIC </p><p>AMBIVALENCE TOWARDS THE FIGHTING AS LONG AS AMAL HOLDS </p><p>ITS OWN AGAINST HIZBALLAH, WHICH RECENT IRANIAN AND     . </p><p>HIZBALLAH CALLS FOR A CEASE-FIRE SEEM TO INDICATE.  THE </p><p>SARG CAN HIDE ITS INACTION BEHIND THE JUSTIFICATION THAT </p><p>IT HAS NO TROOPS IN THE AREA TO INTERVENE. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>11.  (C)  THE CURRENT WILDCARD IS THE POTENTIAL ISRAELI </p><p>REACTION TO THE CONTINUED FIGHTING IN THE IQLIM.  SO FAR, </p><p>NEITHER THE SARG OR THE SYRIAN MEDIA HAS MADE AN ISSUE OF </p><p>RECENT ISRAELI STATEMENTS THREATENING POSSIBLE </p><p>INTERVENTION SHOULD THE FIGHTING THREATEN ISRAEL\'S </p><p>SECURITY (REF H).  THE ISRAELIS MAY BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT </p><p>THE PLO\'S PRESENCE AND ACTIVITIES IN SOUTHERN LEBANON IN </p><p>THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  THE AN NAHAR ARTICLE NO DOUBT GOES TO FAR IN </p><p>CASTING THE FIGHTING IN THE IQLIM AS ENTIRELY A "WAR" </p><p>BETWEEN SYRIA AND IRAN BUT TENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>SPONSORS PROBABLY ARE A FACTOR.  THE ARTICLE DOES </p><p>CORRECTLY HIGHLIGHT MANY OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAVE </p><p>CAUSED STRAINS BETWEEN DAMASCUS AND TEHRAN.    THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES ULTIMATELY ARE AT ODDS IN THEIR VISION FOR </p><p>LEBANON\'S FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>DJEREJIAN </p><p></p></div>
