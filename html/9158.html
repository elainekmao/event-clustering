<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001160 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO USTR </p><p>TREASURY FOR GRAO </p><p>DOC FOR ITA:  ABENAISSA, LDROKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PREL, CE, USTR, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  US REPS FOCUS ON TRADE DURING PRIVATE </p><p>VISIT TO SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  US Representatives Jerry Weller and </p><p>Scott Garrett were in Sri Lanka from June 29 to </p><p>July 3 on a private visit sponsored by a local </p><p>business chamber.  The US Reps, both members of the </p><p>Hill\'s Sri Lanka Caucus, focused primarily on trade </p><p>during meetings with a wide range of Sri Lankan </p><p>private sector and government leaders, including </p><p>the President and Prime Minister.  The US Reps also </p><p>proposed a possible parliamentary exchange with Sri </p><p>Lanka.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Exploring Trade Opportunities </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  US Reps Jerry Weller and Scott Garrett recently </p><p>concluded a 4 day private visit to Sri Lanka </p><p>sponsored by Sri Lanka\'s Federation of Chambers of </p><p>Commerce and Industry.  The US Reps emphasized in </p><p>meetings and events throughout their stay that the </p><p>purpose of their visit was to expand trade </p><p>opportunities between the US and Sri Lanka.  In a </p><p>meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, </p><p>the US Reps praised him for his commitment to </p><p>further economic liberalization.  They pressed </p><p>Wickremesinghe to move forward with legislation </p><p>(now pending before Parliament) to protect </p><p>intellectual property, noting that Congress took a </p><p>dim view of countries that fail to protect </p><p>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).  Wickremesinghe </p><p>assured the delegation that TRIPS-compliant </p><p>legislation would pass Parliament by September, </p><p>despite a current court challenge to a portion of </p><p>the legislation that deals with pharmaceutical </p><p>patents.  US Reps emphasized that legislation alone </p><p>was not sufficient; GSL will need to follow through </p><p>with strict IPR enforcement. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Wickremesinghe asked the US Reps how they </p><p>viewed the prospects for a US-Sri Lankan FTA.  US </p><p>Reps underlined their commitment to broad-based </p><p>free trade as the best way to increase income </p><p>levels, in both the developing and developed world. </p><p>Sri Lanka, they said, should take pride in being </p><p>the first country in South Asia with which the US </p><p>has signed a Trade and Investment Framework </p><p>Agreement (TIFA).  The US, they added, has high FTA </p><p>standards, and any agreement would require </p><p>extensive further liberalization of the Sri Lankan </p><p>economy.  While they hoped the US would move on to </p><p>FTA negotiations with Sri Lanka in the future, much </p><p>would depend on Sri Lanka\'s commitment to open </p><p>access for US goods and services.  US Reps noted </p><p>that increased business opportunities for US firms </p><p>in Sri Lanka would be an important element in </p><p>gaining the support of the US business community </p><p>for an FTA. US Reps made similar points about </p><p>strict US FTA requirements during a press </p><p>conference at the conclusion of their visit. </p><p> </p><p>4.  US Reps also called on President Chandrika </p><p>Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who offered them her view </p><p>on free trade.  Kumaratunga said she is in favor of </p><p>free trade - up to a point.  A country like Sri </p><p>Lanka, however, must ensure that the livelihoods of </p><p>local farmers are protected in any FTA negotiations </p><p>(she pointedly noted that the US also protects its </p><p>agricultural industry).  US Reps emphasized the </p><p>need for Sri Lanka to liberalize the economy as </p><p>much as possible, noting that expanded free trade </p><p>would bring better economic opportunities to all </p><p>Sri Lankans.  The atmosphere in the meeting with </p><p>Kumaratunga was highly cordial, and any </p><p>cohabitations strains she is experiencing with the </p><p>government of Wickremesinghe were not evident. </p><p> </p><p>5.  US Reps also discussed opportunities for </p><p>increasing trade with Minister of Commerce and </p><p>Consumer Affairs Ravi Karunanayake and G.L. Peiris, </p><p>Minister of Enterprise Development, Industrial </p><p>Policy and Investment Promotion.  The delegation </p><p>had additional meetings with leading Sri Lankan </p><p>business groups and chambers, as well as the </p><p>American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Possible Parliamentary Exchange </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  US Reps also met with the Speaker of the </p><p>Parliament Joseph Michael Perera and had the </p><p>opportunity to interact with a wide variety of </p><p>Members of Parliament, including the leader of the </p><p>Opposition and representatives of leading Tamil and </p><p>Muslim parties.  The delegation discussed with the </p><p>Speaker the possibility of a Parliamentary exchange </p><p>with Sri Lanka, noting that both legislatures could </p><p>benefit from the exchange of views and experience. </p><p>US Reps agreed to stay in touch with the Speaker to </p><p>begin to plan for the exchange.  They also </p><p>mentioned the proposal to President Kumaratunga, </p><p>who said she liked the idea. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  This private visit is the first visit - official </p><p>or otherwise - by Members of Congress to Sri Lanka </p><p>in several years.  The Congressmen engaged key </p><p>government leaders across the political spectrum </p><p>and saw first hand the commercial opportunities for </p><p>US companies in this, South Asia\'s most open </p><p>economy.  Sri Lanka, for its part, used the visit </p><p>to voice clearly its commitment to free trade with </p><p>the US - including making the structural reforms </p><p>that an FTA will require.  Post expects this visit </p><p>to be the beginning of greater Congressional </p><p>engagement in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>8.  US Reps Weller and Garrett have not cleared this </p><p>cable. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
