<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 AMMAN 001214 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA -- MARSHALL MILLS, WON CHANG </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/25/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: LOTS OF HOLES TO BE FILLED IN JORDAN\'S 2003 BUDGET </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 485 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Summary.  Jordan\'s new 2003 budget signals a very </p><p>difficult fiscal year ahead for Jordan:  Filling the holes </p><p>needed to meet a 4.3% of GDP deficit target includes finding </p><p>$100 million in additional spending cuts and $100 million in </p><p>still unidentified foreign grants, as well as compensating </p><p>for probable revenue shortfalls.  In the current political </p><p>environment, this challenge is likely to test Jordan\'s </p><p>commitment to fiscal discipline and sound economic policy as </p><p>never before.  U.S. support for sound economic policies and </p><p>reform of government finances, including through the </p><p>provision of supplemental assistance connected to a military </p><p>conflict, will be critical.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Finance Minister Michel Marto announced on </p><p>February 5 a JD2.44 billion ($3.45 billion, JD1=$1.41) </p><p>"emergency budget" for the year 2003.  The announcement was </p><p>more than two months behind Jordan\'s normal budget calendar, </p><p>delayed by the difficulty the GOJ faced in compressing </p><p>expenditure growth and finding new sources of income given </p><p>weakness in revenue growth.  The budget will likely meet the </p><p>deficit targets agreed with the IMF in the May 2002 stand-by </p><p>program (an IMF team is currently in town).  That Marto was </p><p>able to announce a budget that meets the IMF targets despite </p><p>the intense pressures currently on Jordan is a demonstration </p><p>of the government\'s ongoing commitment to sound economic </p><p>policy. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  The main features of the budget, which are also </p><p>summarized in the table at the end of this report, are as </p><p>follows. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Deficit Increase, but Consistent with IMF </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  An increase in the overall deficit to JD316 </p><p>million from JD259 million in 2002.  As a share of GDP, this </p><p>represents an increase to 4.3% from 3.8%.  An increase is, </p><p>however, consistent with the targets set in the IMF program </p><p>(allowing for differences in Jordanian and IMF accounting). </p><p>After taking into account rescheduling of JD100 million of </p><p>debt service by Paris Club and other creditors, the </p><p>government will need to borrow an additional net JD216 </p><p>million, compared to JD184 million last year.  The government </p><p>expects to raise the bulk of this by issuing government </p><p>securities in domestic markets.  The GOJ will also welcome </p><p>new concessional foreign debt (e.g. PL 480 food loans) that </p><p>helps finance budgetary expenditure. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Expenditures Up, but Only a Bit </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Total expenditure increases by JD157 million to </p><p>JD2,441 million from JD2,289 million in 2002.  However, the </p><p>total will fall as a share of GDP from 34 percent to 33 </p><p>percent according to Finance Ministry projections.  This </p><p>means another year of increasingly painful austerity for GOJ </p><p>ministries and agencies.  Of total spending, approximately </p><p>JD2,009 million, or 82%, is current expenditure over which </p><p>the government has little discretion (salaries, pensions, </p><p>supplies, and interest).  As was the case last year, the </p><p>military and security budgets receive the bulk of the </p><p>increase in discretionary spending, including a JD54 million </p><p>increase in military and security service salaries ordered by </p><p>King Abdullah during 2002.  The education and health </p><p>ministries also receive significant increases (see Table II </p><p>below).  The remaining JD502 million is planned for capital </p><p>spending on roads, water projects, schools, courthouses, and </p><p>other government buildings.  As was also the case last year, </p><p>the total includes JD70 million (1% of GDP) in </p><p>still-to-be-identified cuts in ministries\' budgets. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Revenues Stagnate </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Anticipated domestic revenue from tax and non-tax </p><p>sources represents 25% of GDP in 2003, or JD1,803 million. </p><p>This is up from JD1,752 million in 2002, but unchanged as a </p><p>share of GDP.  Tax revenues are slated to rise by 7.2% after </p><p>stagnating in 2002 due to a fall off in customs and General </p><p>Sales Tax (GST)revenues.  In 2003, non-tax revenues increase </p><p>by JD11 million to JD690 million.  Tax increases will also </p><p>have to compensate for an expected decrease in the </p><p>government\'s so-called "oil surplus" (the difference between </p><p>what the GOJ pays Iraq and what it receives from selling the </p><p>oil to the refinery company) due to higher global energy </p><p>prices. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  Marto\'s public presentation did not provide detail </p><p>on how an increase in tax receipts would be accomplished.  In </p><p>a private meeting, he told the Ambassador confidentially that </p><p>the measures agreed within the government are 1) an increase </p><p>in the basic GST rate from 13% to 15% and in the lower GST </p><p>rate from 2% to 5% that would raise JD30 million in new </p><p>revenue, 2) an increase in retail prices for petroleum </p><p>products that would raise JD40-50 million (although prices </p><p>for some products would remain below OECD averages), 3) </p><p>imposing a 5% tax on interest income, and 4) initiating a 2% </p><p>income withholding tax on imported goods that will improve </p><p>efficiency of income tax collection.  Marto said the </p><p>government had agreed, with the King\'s blessing, to phase in </p><p>these measures between March and July 2003.  All of them </p><p>generated hot debate within the government, but Marto said </p><p>the principle of increasing taxation of upper and middle </p><p>income groups and minimizing the impact of new measures on </p><p>the poor had been accepted, despite, he said, the strong </p><p>influence of the business community on the King\'s economic </p><p>thinking. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Foreign Grants Budgeted for, but not Identified </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  The final major budget element is foreign grants, </p><p>for which the budget stipulates an increase to JD322 million </p><p>from JD278 million received in 2002.  This amount includes </p><p>approximately JD70 million ($100 million) in </p><p>still-to-be-identified foreign grants.  Marto told the </p><p>Ambassador that a portion of the identified grants -- </p><p>approximately JD57 million -- will be used to finance Social </p><p>and Economic Transformation Plan (SETP) spending also </p><p>included on the expenditure side of the budget.  This will be </p><p>supplemented by JD55 million in SETP grants received in 2002 </p><p>but not yet spent, bringing total basic 2003 SETP spending to </p><p>JD112 million.  Any additional SETP spending would be </p><p>financed by additional grants received above the JD322 </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>OBSERVATIONS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Following are embassy observations about the budget, </p><p>informed by our conversations with Marto, his deputy Dr. </p><p>Mohammed Abu Hammour, and members of the visiting IMF mission. </p><p> </p><p>--    Despite the "emergency" label, this is not a war </p><p>budget.  It does not take into account expected revenue </p><p>losses (including of the oil surplus) and expenditure </p><p>increases consequent to a military conflict with Iraq. </p><p>Rather, the moniker sends the signal that 2003 will be a very </p><p>difficult year with or without a war.  If there is a war, </p><p>Marto will count on extraordinary U.S. assistance to make up </p><p>for budget shortfalls, as he discussed in late 2002 in </p><p>Washington. </p><p> </p><p>--    The budget\'s achievability depends on the observer\'s </p><p>confidence in the government\'s ability to impose additional </p><p>spending cuts (at least the JD70 million figured into the </p><p>deficit) and revenue measures over the course of the year, as </p><p>well as to raise $100 million in so far unidentified foreign </p><p>grants.  Past performance gives a measure of confidence (see </p><p>reftel for the heroic measures taken to bring the 2002 </p><p>deficit within striking distance of the IMF target).  As in </p><p>the past, capital spending on sorely needed improvements in </p><p>infrastructure will likely bear the brunt of cuts. </p><p> </p><p>--    However, given the current political tension </p><p>surrounding a conflict with Iraq and the slowness of progress </p><p>on the Palestinian issue -- plus the years of fiscal </p><p>restraint the country has already endured -- the political </p><p>difficulty of tough decisions (which may be equivalent to at </p><p>least 2-3% of GDP) is likely much more intense than in past </p><p>years.  Parliamentary elections by summer will bring </p><p>increased pressures from political leaders for fiscal </p><p>generosity, and a new Parliament by mid-year will most likely </p><p>make austerity even harder to bear. </p><p>--    The budget does not make bold structural changes:  it\'s </p><p>business as usual on both the revenue and expenditure sides. </p><p>On revenues, the tax system is clearly not responsive to GDP </p><p>growth.  In 2002, the GST, which accounts for 60 % of non-tax </p><p>revenue, stagnated, as it failed to capture income growth </p><p>that was not reflected in greater consumption (see Table IV). </p><p>Greater utilization of direct income taxation to supplement </p><p>the GST (which the minister prefers as being relatively easy </p><p>and inexpensive to administer) could provide greater </p><p>stability and diversification in the tax system, and also </p><p>help make the tax structure more progressive.  On </p><p>expenditures, some progress has been made in overhauling the </p><p>over-generous military pension system (the length of service </p><p>requirement has been extended), but more needs to be done to </p><p>make this system less generous and thereby decrease its </p><p>disincentives to employment and productive use of resources. </p><p> </p><p>--    Recurring expenditures under SETP projects are not yet </p><p>a budgetary issue, but are likely to be in the future.  So </p><p>far, only a relatively small amount has been spent on SETP </p><p>projects (about JD40-50 million in 2002).  But an increase in </p><p>recurring expenditures in future years underscores the need </p><p>for a more fundamental approach to revenue and expenditure </p><p>reform. </p><p> </p><p>--    The budget does not include spending on critical </p><p>infrastructure projects, such as the Disi water project, the </p><p>Samra power plant project, the Aqaba-Amman natural gas </p><p>pipeline, and the Amman city center (Abdali) project.  The </p><p>government hopes that these will be financed by the private </p><p>sector through "build-own-operate" arrangements.  The </p><p>government is likely however to be under considerable </p><p>pressure to provide financial guarantees for these projects, </p><p>which would increase its sovereign debt levels. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Comment:  A Chance to Encourage Fiscal Reform </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (c)  In the end, the budget is likely to prove a paper </p><p>exercise given the overwhelming impact a military conflict </p><p>would have on Jordan\'s finances.  It serves, however, to </p><p>highlight the fiscal pressures on the government as well as </p><p>the need for structural changes in revenues and expenditures </p><p>in order to put the government\'s finances on a sustainable </p><p>track.  Emergency assistance provided by the U.S. or other </p><p>countries to help Jordan adjust to a conflict should provide </p><p>opportunities to leverage such changes.  Our bottom line is </p><p>that the King\'s and government\'s support for the sound </p><p>economic policies supported by the IMF remains intact, but </p><p>that this commitment is likely to be tested in 2003 as never </p><p>before. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (c)  The budget also serves to highlight the political </p><p>pressures on the finance minister.  Marto confidentially and </p><p>frankly described the growing fatigue with fiscal discipline </p><p>he perceives on the part of the King, prime minister and </p><p>other ministers.  We believe the King continues to value his </p><p>service, but that patience could wear thin since he hears </p><p>only criticism of Marto from the vast majority of his other </p><p>economic and political advisers.  The alternative to Marto is </p><p>a less experienced minister who would be picked for his </p><p>readiness to spend and take on new debts.  We can help to the </p><p>extent that we find ways to counterbalance the pressures on </p><p>Marto by expressing support for him and his policies. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>TABLES </p><p>------ </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>TABLE I </p><p>Jordan\'s 2003 Budget:  Basic Features </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>                               (JD millions) </p><p> </p><p>                          2003       2002      2001 </p><p>                        budget   estimate    actual </p><p>                        ------   --------    ------ </p><p>Revenues                  1803       1752      1719 </p><p>  Domestic Revenue        1764       1680      1638 </p><p>    Tax Revenues          1074       1000       996 </p><p>    Non-Tax Revenues       690        679       642 </p><p>  Other Revenues            39         73        81 </p><p> </p><p>Foreign Grants             322        278       249 </p><p>Current Expenditures      1939       1852      1789 </p><p>  Current spending        1799       1660      1568 </p><p>       (non-interest) </p><p>  Interest Payments        210        192       220 </p><p>  Unidentified cuts        -70          -         - </p><p> </p><p>Capital Spending           502        437       404 </p><p> </p><p>                        ------    -------    ------ </p><p>Balance                   -316       -259      -224 </p><p>                        ------    -------    ------ </p><p> </p><p>Rescheduled Interest       100         75        69 </p><p> </p><p>Borrowing need            -216       -184      -156 </p><p> </p><p>Note: GDP                 7350       6780      6260 </p><p> </p><p>  --------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>                       TABLE II </p><p>  CURRENT EXPENDITURE BY MINISTRY/GOVT.
