(C) SUMMARY: THIS REPORT PROVIDES KEY ECONOMIC DATA </p><p>ENABLING READERSHIP TO STAY ABREAST OF ZIMBABWE\'S FALLING </p><p>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.  TWO MONTHS INTO THE NEW YEAR A </p><p>BETTER PICTURE OF LAST YEAR\'S POOR PERFORMANCE IS </p><p>EMERGING, AS WELL AS TRENDS THAT DO NOT BODE WELL FOR </p><p>2001.  IN BRIEF THE RESULTS ARE: </p><p> </p><p>= REAL GDP DECLINED IN 2000, ABOUT 5 PERCENT BY GOZ </p><p>ESTIMATES, AND AT LEAST 7-8 PERCENT ACCORDING TO US AND </p><p>LOCAL ECONOMISTS; </p><p>= INFLATION, AT 56 PERCENT IN 2000, IS EXPECTED TO STAY </p><p>STRONG, AND COULD VERY WELL INCREASE IF A TURNAROUND IS </p><p>NOT SOON ENGINEERED; </p><p>= TRADE FLOWS WILL CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVE AND THE </p><p>BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS SITUATION WILL WORSEN, AS ARREARS </p><p>MOUNT AND DEVELOPMENT AID AND MULTILATERAL LENDING REMAIN </p><p>SHUTOFF; </p><p>= ARREARS (COMBINED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS) WILL </p><p>EASILY EXCEED U.S. $1 BILLION EQUIVALENT BEFORE MID-YEAR; </p><p>= GOVERNMENT DEBT WILL CONTINUE TO SOAR, DRIVEN BY </p><p>DEFICIT SPENDING AND VERY HIGH INTEREST COSTS; </p><p>= ANY TURNAROUND MUST ADDRESS THE CURRENT DEBT TRAP, </p><p>REQUIRE STRICT BUDGET ADHERENCE, ARREST THE RUNAWAY MONEY </p><p>SUPPLY GROWTH, ENSURE RATIONAL DEVALUATION, SEE THE </p><p>RESTORATION OF LAW AND ORDER, AND A PULLOUT FROM THE </p><p>CONGO.  END SUMMARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00926  01 OF 03  061320Z </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>DECLINING GDP </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) IN HIS NOVEMBER 2000 BUDGET SPEECH, THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER REVEALED THAT HIS MINISTRY EXPECTED A 4.2 DROP </p><p>IN REAL GDP FOR 2000, A DECLINE MUCH WORSE THAN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S MID-YEAR ESTIMATE OF 1.3 PERCENT.  THE </p><p>MINISTRY HAS SINCE BUMPED ITS PROJECTION TO 4.8 PERCENT, </p><p>A FIGURE THAT SIGNIFIES A SERIOUS FALL.  MANY LOCAL </p><p>ECONOMISTS CONSIDER THIS TOO LOW, AND ESTIMATE THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY SHRUNK BY AT LEAST 7 TO 8 PERCENT </p><p>BASED ON DATA SHOWING THAT MANUFACTURING AND MINING </p><p>RESPECTIVELY DECLINED 10.5 AND 14 PERCENT, WITH </p><p>CONSTRUCTION AND TOURISM OFF BY AT LEAST 60 PERCENT.  THE </p><p>FUEL SHORTAGES EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT 2000 HAVE ALSO </p><p>SQUEEZED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN ALL SECTORS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) OF POTENTIALLY GREATER CONCERN IS THAT THE CAUSES </p><p>BEHIND LAST YEAR\'S POOR RESULTS HAVE NOT ABATED AND IN </p><p>AGRICULTURE, THE COUNTRY\'S BIGGEST ECONOMIC SEGMENT, HAVE </p><p>ACTUALLY GOTTEN WORSE.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S ACTIONS DRIVEN </p><p>BY ITS POLITICAL AGENDA HAVE INCREASED ITS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ISOLATION; WITH ASSISTANCE BEING CUT OR SUSPENDED WHILE </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME PORTFOLIO AND DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT </p><p>HAVE VIRTUALLY DRIED UP, AS MOST OVERSEAS COMMERCIAL </p><p>BANKS HAVE SHUT DOWN OR WITHDRAWN LINES OF CREDIT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ANNUAL INFLATION, WHICH AVERAGED 58.5 PERCENT IN </p><p>1999, DECREASED TO 55.9 PERCENT IN 2000 ACCORDING TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00926  01 OF 03  061320Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT STATISTICS.  LOCAL BUSINESSES, BASED ON THEIR </p><p>PAYMENT STREAMS, PEG LAST YEAR\'S REAL, OVERALL INFLATION </p><p>RATE AT 80 - 85 PERCENT, A FIGURE WE AGREE WITH.  THE </p><p>PRESSURES BEHIND THE PRICE INCREASES REMAIN HIGH, DRIVEN </p><p>BY EXCESSIVE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH (THE BROAD MONEY GROWTH </p><p>RATE INCREASED FROM UNDER 30 PERCENT IN DECEMBER 1999 TO </p><p>61.2 PERCENT IN OCTOBER 2000), CONTINUED HIGH BORROWING </p><p>NEEDS OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE INCREASING SPREAD </p><p>BETWEEN THE OFFICIAL AND "PARALLEL" FOREIGN EXCHANGE </p><p>RATES (55:1 V.S. 80-90:1). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>TRADE FLOWS AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) EXPORTS ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE FALLEN BY 5.4 </p><p>PERCENT IN 2000, LEADING TO A CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT OF </p><p>U.S. $210 MILLION, DESPITE AN ESTIMATED 9.3 PERCENT </p><p>DECLINE IN IMPORTS (THE LATTER CAUSED BY THE HARD </p><p>CURRENCY SHORTAGE AND DECLINING GDP).  THIS IS A SHARP </p><p>DETERIORATION FROM THE 1999 CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS OF </p><p>U.S. $29 MILLION.  WITH NO INVESTMENT FLOW AND REDUCED </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, THE OFFICIAL CAPITAL ACCOUNT IS </p><p>ESTIMATED TO HAVE REGISTERED A DEFICIT OF U.S. $401 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5190 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00926  02 OF 03  061320Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   USIE-00  FMP-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------CE3065  061320Z /38 </p><p>R 061318Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8362 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000926 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND BARAK HOFFMAN </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/06 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00926  02 OF 03  061320Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S RECENT ECONOMIC RESULTS AND OUTLOOK </p><p> </p><p>MILLION, RESULTING IN A NEGATIVE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS </p><p>POSITION OF U.S. $611 MILLION IN 2000. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) GIVEN THIS VERY POOR FUNDS-FLOW BACKDROP, IT </p><p>SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THAT ZIMBABWE IS FINDING IT </p><p>INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO MEET ITS FOREIGN PAYMENT </p><p>OBLIGATIONS, FOR BOTH CURRENT EXPENDITURES (SUCH AS FUEL) </p><p>AND DEBT REPAYMENT.  FOREIGN ARREARS, WHICH STOOD AT U.S. </p><p>$109 MILLION AT YEAR-END 1999, SOARED TO WELL OVER $600 </p><p>MILLION AT YEAR-END 2000.  WE ESTIMATE A CURRENT ACCOUNT </p><p>DEFICIT OF AT LEAST $300 MILLION FOR THIS YEAR (THOUGH </p><p>THIS COULD MORE THAN DOUBLE IF AGRICULTURAL RESULTS ARE </p><p>POOR), WHICH WHEN ADDED TO INCREASING PAYMENT ARREARS </p><p>MEANS A TOTAL FINANCING REQUIREMENT IN 2001 OF AT LEAST </p><p>U.S. $1.1 BILLION (IF ZIMBABWE IS NOT GOING TO BACKSLIDE </p><p>FURTHER).  THE PROSPECTS OF ADDRESSING THIS GAP ARE </p><p>DAUNTING TO SAY THE LEAST, AND EVEN THE FULL RE- </p><p>ENGAGEMENT AND WHOLEHEARTED PROGRAM SUPPORT OF ALL DONORS </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL LENDERS WOULD LIKELY BE INSUFFICIENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S DOMESTIC DEBT </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) A DEFICIT OF Z $10.8 BILLION (4.8 PERCENT OF GDP) </p><p>WAS PROJECTED IN THE 2000 GOZ BUDGET. HOWEVER, BY YEAR- </p><p>END THIS HAD INCREASED TO Z $ 55.2 BILLION (ABOUT 24 </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP), WHICH AMOUNT WAS TOTALLY FINANCED BY </p><p>DOMESTIC BORROWING.  THE CURRENT PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00926  02 OF 03  061320Z </p><p>EXCEEDS Z $160 BILLION, HAVING MORE THAN DOUBLED FROM $80 </p><p>BILLION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.  SHORT-TERM </p><p>TREASURY BILLS MAKE UP THE VAST BULK OF THIS DEBT, AND </p><p>WITH THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE WELL EXCEEDING 55 PERCENT </p><p>LAST YEAR, THE INTEREST BILL ALONE MAKES UP NEARLY HALF </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT OUTLAYS.  THE RUNAWAY GROWTH OF INTEREST </p><p>COSTS, AS DEBT BALLOONS, CAUSED THE GOVERNMENT TO BORROW </p><p>OVER 42 PERCENT OF ITS BUDGET IN 2000 FROM THE DOMESTIC </p><p>SAVINGS POOL.  IN SHORT IT BORROWED MONEY AT NEAR- </p><p>USURIOUS INTEREST RATES TO PAY THE INTEREST ON MONEY IT </p><p>HAD PREVIOUSLY BORROWED. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>MOVES TO RESTRUCTURE THE DEBT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) TO CUSHION THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THIS </p><p>DEBT/BORROWING CYCLE, THE FINANCE MINSTER PROMISED IN THE </p><p>2001 BUDGET THAT HE WOULD RESTRUCTURE THE GOZ DOMESTIC </p><p>DEBT; REDUCING THE SHORT TERM (I.E., T-BILL) PORTION FROM </p><p>ABOUT 96 PERCENT DOWN TO 70 PERCENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>LOWER THE GOVERNMENT\'S TOTAL INTEREST BILL.  (THE GOZ\'S </p><p>LONG-TERM DEBT STOCK, Z$8 BILLION OUT OF Z$162 BILLION, </p><p>WAS ISSUED IN THE LATE 1980\'S AND EARLY 1990\'S AT RATES </p><p>BETWEEN 9 AND 24 PERCENT.)  TO ACHIEVE THIS END, THE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTRY AT THE END OF JANUARY EMBARKED ON AN </p><p>EFFORT TO DRIVE DOWN MONEY MARKET RATES BY 1) NOT ROLLING </p><p>OVER MATURING T-BILLS, AND 2) RELEASING THE CENTRAL </p><p>BANK\'S STATUTORY RESERVES ONTO THE MARKET VIA A 15 </p><p>PERCENT FACILITY TARGETED AT EXPORTERS.  THE RESULTANT </p><p>FLOOD OF LIQUIDITY CAUSED A DRASTIC, AND ENGINEERED, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00926  02 OF 03  061320Z </p><p>RECENT DIP IN RATES TO THE MID-TEENS, A RATE FAR BELOW </p><p>INFLATION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) INTO THIS NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, THE </p><p>MINISTRY ANNOUNCED IN MID-FEBRUARY THE FLOTATION OF A Z </p><p>$25 BILLION, FIVE-YEAR TREASURY BOND WITH A FIXED 25 </p><p>PERCENT INTEREST COUPON.  (ABOUT U.S. $450 MILLION AT </p><p>OFFICIAL RATES AND EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 15 PERCENT OF </p><p>CURRENT, TOTAL GOZ DEBT.)  TO ENSURE ITS SALE, THE </p><p>CENTRAL BANK SIMULTANEOUSLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS TO </p><p>BEGIN ENFORCING A PROSCRIBED ASSETS RULE, DICTATING THAT </p><p>A MINIMUM PORTION OF THE HOLDINGS OF FINANCIAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, PENSION FUNDS AND INSURERS MUST BE HELD IN </p><p>VARIOUS MATURITIES OF GOVERNMENT PAPER.  CAUGHT IN THIS </p><p>SQUEEZE THE HOLDERS OF CASH HAVE HAD TO BELLY UP (IN ALL </p><p>CASES AGAINST THEIR WISHES AND FIDUCIARY PRINCIPLES) AND </p><p>THE ISSUE, WHICH CLOSED MARCH 5, IS EXPECTED TO SELLOUT. </p><p>THE FINANCE MINISTRY\'S MUSCLING IN ON THE FINANCIAL </p><p>MARKETS EFFECTIVELY STEALS PRESENT SAVINGS THROUGH ITS </p><p>SHARPLY NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES, UNLESS INFLATION FALLS </p><p>DRASTICALLY IN THE NEAR TERM, A DEVELOPMENT NO ONE </p><p>FORESEES OCCURRING.
