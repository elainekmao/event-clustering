Summary.  Textile provisions of the Africa Growth and </p><p>Opportunity Act (AGOA) encourage millions of dollars in </p><p>foreign investment, create thousands of new jobs and boost </p><p>exports across Africa, except in Nigeria.  Sub-Saharan </p><p>Africa\'s second largest economy has not taken advantage of </p><p>AGOA\'s duty-free textile opportunities. A key impediment is </p><p>the inadequate safeguards against transshipment by ineligible </p><p>countries.   Legislation to establish an appropriate export </p><p>visa regime remains stalled in the National Assembly.  Even </p><p>if the bill were passed, Nigeria\'s textile industry would </p><p>still face problems of low productivity and poor </p><p>infrastructure--especially poor transportation links and high </p><p>energy costs. Nigeria could still benefit from AGOA if firms </p><p>were to increase their competitiveness quickly, possibly </p><p>through free trade zones that might encourage local </p><p>industries to pool resources and attract desperately needed </p><p>foreign expertise and capital.  Unless Nigeria moves quickly, </p><p> it may fall farther  behind as ot </p><p>her African nations race to develop their textile industries </p><p>in anticipation of the January 1, 2004, requirement that </p><p>AGOA-eligible garments be assembled from textiles made in the </p><p>United State or other AGOA countries.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Assembly\'s Inaction </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Nigeria is ineligible for AGOA\'s duty-free textile </p><p>provisions at present because it lacks safeguards against </p><p>transshipment.  A bill providing for the requisite safeguards </p><p>is stalled before the National Assembly.  House Finance </p><p>Committee Chair Mohammed Sanusi Daggash told Emboff early in </p><p>2002 that legislation would be enacted in June 2002 (reftel); </p><p>however, eligibility for the textile provisions has not been </p><p>a priority, partly because members misunderstand AGOA\'s </p><p>potential benefits.  While industry organizations have often </p><p>expressed their frustration publicly about the legislature\'s </p><p>inaction, none has engaged in effective lobbying to inform </p><p>and persuade legislators about the missed opportunities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Comment. Since 1999, the National Assembly has passed few </p><p>non-budget bills.  The National Assembly has a very limited </p><p>capacity to formulate economic policy owing to lack of </p><p>understanding of basic economic principles and little will to </p><p>legislate serious economic reform. For many members, </p><p>consolidating their gains as parliamentarians and preparing </p><p>for elections have taken precedence over reviving Nigeria\'s </p><p>stagnant non-oil sector.  Now that the legislators\' attention </p><p>is firmly focused on the 2003 elections, it is unlikely a </p><p>bill will be passed until next summer at the earliest.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Problems and Potential </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Even if legislation were passed today,  Nigerian firms </p><p>would need help to penetrate the American market. Once a </p><p>significant source of employment and foreign exchange, the </p><p>textile industry is in poor condition.  It suffers from </p><p>decaying manufacturing plants and declining capacity, which </p><p>have driven costs up and competitiveness down.  Nigeria\'s </p><p>manufacturers must overcome these problems and a </p><p>dysfunctional infrastructure to produce low-cost, </p><p>high-quality goods.  The frequency of Nigeria\'s power outages </p><p>is the most costly infrastructure problem, forcing firms to </p><p>rely on expensive generators.  This constitutes an enormous </p><p>disadvantage for textile manufacturers who have significantly </p><p>greater demand for electricity than do garment assemblers. </p><p>The apparel sector is nevertheless practically non-existent, </p><p>and the textile industry operates at only thirty- percent </p><p>capacity.  Cheaper imports from China and India have flooded </p><p>the country and driven many Nigerian firms out of business. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Although the industry is in dire straits, hope is not </p><p>beyond reason.  According to a report published by American </p><p>textile experts (reftel), Nigeria could become a major </p><p>textile and garment exporter under AGOA.  Cotton is grown </p><p>locally and the country has an abundance of cheap labor. </p><p>While apparel manufacturing is merely a cottage industry </p><p>today, new factories could draw on the existing labor pool. </p><p>If textile firms were to become more competitive, they could </p><p>provide inputs not only to domestic firms but also to other </p><p>African countries, especially after 2004 when the AGOA </p><p>provisions allowing less developed countries to use inputs </p><p>from elsewhere expire.  Nigeria\'s challenge is to transform </p><p>this potential into a vibrant export industry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Government Efforts </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. While Nigeria\'s public and private sectors constantly </p><p>bemoan the industry\'s decline, both have done relatively </p><p>little to address the structural deficiencies that make </p><p>Nigerian firms non-competitive.  Beyond the marginal </p><p>improvement in power generation since 1999, the only tangible </p><p>action the government has taken has been to erect barriers to </p><p>trade.  In 2002, in response to pleas by textile unions and </p><p>manufacturers, the government imposed a temporary import ban </p><p>on printed fabric (since replaced by quality and price </p><p>controls).  Beyond protectionism, government efforts have </p><p>produced many reports but few results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  In late 2002, President Obasanjo established a committee </p><p>to revive the textile industry.  The committee\'s mandate </p><p>called for a "blue-print" to restore the position the </p><p>industry held during the mid-1980s.  The committee comprised </p><p>representatives from federal ministries, state governments, </p><p>professional associations, unions, a few private </p><p>manufacturers, and the United Nations Industrial Development </p><p>Organization (UNIDO).  In its final report released in </p><p>October 2002 the committee recommended ways of boosting </p><p>exports to Europe and the United States, all with a view to </p><p>meeting Obasanjo\'s goal of exporting one billion USD worth of </p><p>textiles a year by 2006.  Its recommendations called for a </p><p>tightening up of import restrictions and penalties to curb </p><p>illegal imports, as well as measures to increase cotton </p><p>production and improve the infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Nigeria\'s Ministry of Commerce, in cooperation with the </p><p>United States-Nigerian Development Institution (to which </p><p>USAID has provided funding), has initiated the Nigerian </p><p>Apparel and Footwear Project, which aims to bring the </p><p>operations of selected Nigerian manufacturers to </p><p>international standards.  The initiative is an element of the </p><p>GON\'s overall effort to increase non-oil exports to 500 </p><p>million USD by the end of 2003. The Ministry of Industry is </p><p>working with UNIDO on a "blue-print" to restructure and </p><p>rehabilitate the textile and garment industry, with a </p><p>specific focus on AGOA to stimulate production.  UNIDO </p><p>expects to complete the project by the end of 2003, at which </p><p>time it hopes to provide the GON follow-up assistance to </p><p>implement specific recommendations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Private Sector Efforts </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. In terms of resuscitating the ailing textile industry, the </p><p>private sector has done no </p><p>better a job than the government.  Private sector awareness </p><p>is high, as evidenced by the frequent mention of AGOA at </p><p>business seminars and in the media, but few firms understand </p><p>the nuts and bolts of exporting under its provisions.  To </p><p>enlighten them, the Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce </p><p>will soon publish a "how to" manual outlining all the </p><p>necessary steps for accessing the US market.  However, while </p><p>a few large firms (mainly subsidiaries of international </p><p>conglomerates) have expressed serious </p><p>interest in AGOA, many smaller firms are pessimistic about </p><p>Nigeria\'s chances of becoming competitive and thus have shown </p><p>little initiative to grasp the opportunities available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. An assertion by J.P. Olarewaju, Executive Director of the </p><p>Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association (NTMA), is a good </p><p>example of the latter attitude.  Olarewaju told Econoff in </p><p>December that although AGOA seems like a great deal, most of </p><p>NTMA\'s members believe that they cannot manufacture high </p><p>quality textiles or assemble garments to compete with other </p><p>AGOA suppliers. Olarewaju said the major impediment to </p><p>restructuring the industry is lack of capital since firms </p><p>desperately need to upgrade and replace old machinery. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Econoff asked Olarewaju if Nigerian firms had approached </p><p>Lebanese, Chinese or Indians investors already active in </p><p>Africa for capital and expertise. Olarewaju replied </p><p>derisively that these Asian businessmen are "merely traders" </p><p>only interested in dumping textile products and hurting local </p><p>firms.  The NTMA recommends that Nigeria\'s government provide </p><p>capital or lease machinery to private firms through the Bank </p><p>of Industry.  Olarewaju hopes that Nigerian firms will pool </p><p>their resources and form cooperatives, and believes the </p><p>government should spearhead such an initiative.  He also </p><p>hopes the government will perform market research so firms </p><p>might have a better idea of the American market.  (NOTE: </p><p>USTR, PAS and ECON invited U.S. purchasing reps to tour </p><p>Nigeria in 2000 and 2001.  FCS, ECON and others have sent </p><p>Nigerian delegations to the States as well.  Purchasers </p><p>(usually for deparment stores and chains that control 90 </p><p>percent of the garment trade) can tell suppliers how to make </p><p>desired products.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Comment: Are AGOA Benefits out of Reach? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. The problems of Nigeria\'s existing textile and garment </p><p>industry are evident.  The high cost of business associated </p><p>with Nigeria\'s poor infrastructure,  outdated technology, and </p><p>stiff competition from cheap imports has propelled the </p><p>industry into steep decline.  While industry analysts agree </p><p>on the problems, few offer feasible solutions or demonstrate </p><p>leadership to implement them. At the moment, only a handful </p><p>of manufacturers assemble apparel.  Existing textile firms, </p><p>which produce low quality African design prints, need to </p><p>switch operations or upgrade existing machinery to produce </p><p>inputs for world markets. Nigerian firms need to find ways to </p><p>ship goods out in a timely manner.  They must also achieve a </p><p>reasonable cost structure, which should not be extremely </p><p>difficult.  To become globally competitive, Nigeria needs </p><p>leadership to coordinate the industry\'s public and private </p><p>sector activities in order to move forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. The government has not demonstrated that it can devise </p><p>and implement a plan that might make Nigeria more competitive </p><p>for AGOA textiles. In general, Government action tends to </p><p>hurt, not help, the manufacturing sector.  Politicians spend </p><p>more time squabbling over their own or their constituencies\' </p><p>access to easy oil money, than over ways to improve the </p><p>infrastructure and create a good investment climate.  State </p><p>and local authorities impose heavy tax burdens on textile </p><p>firms, as they are easier targets than the multitude of </p><p>importers who sell goods from the privacy of their homes. </p><p>While tariffs (the second largest source of revenue behind </p><p>oil taxes and royalties is the preferred policy tool) offer </p><p>little effective protection, tariffs encourage smuggling </p><p>across Nigeria\'s porous borders, often through the complicity </p><p>of corrupt customs officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  Nigeria\'s government still has an indispensable role to </p><p>play establishing the groundwork to sustain a successful </p><p>domestic textile and apparel manufacturing industry.  It </p><p>needs to improve utilities, roads and ports.  The government </p><p>must change its policy direction and invest in economic </p><p>reform.  Having said this, private sector initiative is the </p><p>key factor determining whether or not Nigeria will benefit </p><p>from AGOA\'s textile provisions.  As Nigeria falls farther and </p><p>farther behind its African competitors, appropriate </p><p>corrective government action becomes increasingly important. </p><p>But groups like the NTMA must not wait for the government to </p><p>do all the work. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. Several Nigerian firms have links to international </p><p>conglomerates and a few Nigerian entrepreneurs could compete </p><p>in the American market under the right conditions.  The most </p><p>important would be a reduction in the cost of doing business, </p><p>especially high production costs associated with the </p><p>procurement of power generating, water provisioning, and </p><p>telecommunications equipment to neutralize outages when </p><p>public services fail.  In the short term, companies can share </p><p>utility costs by clustering in industrial parks or free trade </p><p>zone (FTZ) like the existing site in Calabar and the planned </p><p>site in Lagos.  An FTZ offers added benefit in that zone </p><p>administrators have authority to issue regulations </p><p>independent of the federal government.  By joining forces, </p><p>firms could lobby FTZ authorities to quickly implement </p><p>polices to help firms produce and ship products at a cost low </p><p>enough to be competitive.   Streamlined shipping and customs </p><p>procedures could reduce the opportunities for corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Many domestic firms claim that the highest cost is not </p><p>associated with inadequate infrastructure but access to </p><p>capital.  However, according to the International Finance </p><p>Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, equity </p><p>and debt financing is available in Nigeria.  To be sure, the </p><p>equity market is thin and debt financing is costly. But an </p><p>equally important problem is that few entrepreneurs have </p><p>sound business plans.  By seeking help abroad, domestic firms </p><p>could find not only much needed expertise for textile and </p><p>apparel production but also additional sources of capital. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. Nigeria\'s longstanding dependence on oil has drawn </p><p>resources and energy away from the non-oil sector, rendering </p><p>much of the manufacturing sector idle.  The elite who have </p><p>enjoyed easy access to oil revenue have had little incentive </p><p>to plow resources into the non-oil sector.  Nigeria has yet </p><p>to orient itself to the global economy.  Few firms or </p><p>politicians understand the opportunities that exist or have </p><p>demonstrated initiative to attract foreign direct investment. </p><p> Nigeria might still benefit from AGOA, however, if the </p><p>private sector quickly finds ways to improve its </p><p>competitiveness by clustering and establishing ties with </p><p>foreign investors.  But if Nigeria\'s firms continue to sit </p><p>back and wait for government action, AGOA\'s textile benefits </p><p>will increasingly fall beyond their reach.
