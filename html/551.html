ICRC-ZAGREB REPORTS THE RELEASE, ON NOVEMBER 3, </p><p>OF 87 PRISONERS FROM B-H CAMPS.  SIXTY-ONE PRISONERS </p><p>HELD BY SERBIAN FORCES IN KAMENICA (NEAR DRVAR) HAVE </p><p>BEEN RELEASED AND TRANSFERED BY ICRC TO THE TRANSIT </p><p>CENTER IN KARLOVAC (REPUBLIC OF CROATIA) RUN BY </p><p>UNHCR.  ANOTHER GROUP OF 25 SERBIAN PRISONERS, HELD </p><p>BY MUSLIM FORCES IN BIHAC AND CAZIN, HAVE BEEN </p><p>RELEASED AND TRANSFERED BY ICRC VIA CROATIA TO OSIJEK </p><p>AND FROM THERE TO THE FRY.  ONE FREED DETAINEE CHOSE </p><p>TO STAY IN THE BIHAC AREA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ICRC-ZAGREB ALSO REPORTS THAT THE PLANNED RELEASE </p><p>OF OVER 3,000 PRISONERS AT THE MANJACA CAMP HAS BEEN </p><p>INDEFINITELY POSTPONED, IN PART BECAUSE UNHCR HAS </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO FIND PLACES FOR THE RELEASED DETAINEES </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02263  01 OF 02  031550Z </p><p>CURRENTLY IN KARLOVAC AND IN PART BECAUSE SERBIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAVE YET TO ORDER THEIR RELEASE (SEE </p><p>PARA. 4).  THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS APPARENTLY </p><p>REFUSED OR BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL TRANSIT </p><p>FACILITIES INSIDE CROATIA.  (COMMENT:  PROCESSING FOR </p><p>THE 1,000 EX-DETAINEES AND THEIR FAMILIES WHOM THE </p><p>U.S. HAS OFFERED TO TAKE IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE </p><p>COMPLETED UNTIL LATE DECEMBER.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE TRANSIT FACILITY AT KARLOVAC IS PRESENTLY </p><p>FULL.  ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO HOUSE 2,000 DETAINEES, </p><p>500 PLACES HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE OF THE DANGER POSED </p><p>BY A SEVERELY DAMAGED ORTHODOX CHURCH WHICH IS </p><p>ADJACENT TO THE FACILITY AND COULD COLLAPSE AT ANY </p><p>MOMENT.  ICRC HOPES THAT THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WILL </p><p>AT LEAST PERMIT UNHCR TO REPLACE THESE 500 PLACES </p><p>WHICH HAVE BEEN LOST. </p><p>4.  THE LACK OF INSTRUCTIONS FROM RADOVAN KARADZIC TO </p><p>THE SERBIAN AUTHORITIES RUNNING THE MANJACA CAMP ARE </p><p>REPORTEDLY ANOTHER ELEMENT COMPLICATING THE RELEASE </p><p>OF THE PRISONERS.  DURING A RECENT VISIT TO MANJACA, </p><p>OFDA CONTRACTOR TOM BRENNAN RECEIVED THE IMPRESSION </p><p>THAT THE SERBS RUNNING THE CAMP WOULD BE MORE THAN </p><p>HAPPY TO BE RID OF THE PRISONERS IF THEY WERE ONLY TO </p><p>RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS TO DO SO.  ICRC-ZAGREB OFFICIALS </p><p>CONFIRMED THESE IMPRESSIONS, ADDING THAT UNSC </p><p>RESOLUTION 780 CREATING A WAR CRIMES COMMISSION </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE HAD A VISIBLE IMPACT ON THE ATTITUDES </p><p>OF THE CAMP AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.
