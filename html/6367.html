<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001634 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY/IRAQ: OPPOSITION CHP\'S GRATUITOUS </p><p>RESISTANCE CONTINUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1350 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Contacts from main opposition CHP say that </p><p>although another UN resolution could influence some </p><p>backbenchers, CHP is likely to continue to vote en bloc </p><p>against U.S. troop deployment.  Taking their cue from </p><p>President Sezer, CHPers at all levels assert that any UNSC </p><p>resolutionless operation would lack "international </p><p>legitimacy", which they claim is required under the Turkish </p><p>constitution.  They also criticize the AK government\'s </p><p>alleged failure to share detailed information with CHP on </p><p>Turkey\'s role in post-Saddam Iraq.  Bottom line: CHP is </p><p>engaging in sterile opposition.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>CHP still looking for more "international legitimacy" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a March 7 meeting with Congressmen Wexler and </p><p>Whitfield, CHP Chairman Deniz Baykal interpreted constitution </p><p>art. 92 as requiring "international legitimacy" for any </p><p>Parliamentary authorization to deploy U.S. troops to Turkey. </p><p>"If you take the constitution seriously, then you could not </p><p>support war in Iraq," he said.  In any case, Baykal </p><p>explained, bringing democracy to Iraq is a "utopian idea." </p><p>Without a another UNSC resolution or a NATO-backed decision, </p><p>CHP will remain opposed.  Even then, CHP may not change its </p><p>position, but a second resolution "will help." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) March 11 ANAP Central Board member and former minister </p><p>Vehbi Dincerler explained to us that he had contacted former </p><p>ambassador and senior CHP deputy Sukru Elekdag to discuss </p><p>art. 92.  Dincerler, who was in Parliament during the Gulf </p><p>War, argued to Elekdag that international legitimacy applies </p><p>only to declarations of war.  According to Dincerler, Elekdag </p><p>simply shrugged, saying "as a lawyer, you would know better </p><p>than myself."  Dincerler is an engineer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CHP M.P. and Human Rights Committee member Engin Altay </p><p>told poloff March 10 that TGS chief Ozkok\'s March 8 public </p><p>statement endorsing passage of a deployment resolution could </p><p>play a role in changing the minds of individual CHP deputies. </p><p> Nevertheless, he explained, Baykal\'s position against the </p><p>deployment of U.S. troops is clear and is not likely to </p><p>change. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>AK isn\'t sharing </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In recent conversations, CHP deputies complained to </p><p>poloff that the AK Government is not sharing enough detailed </p><p>information on either the political statement, military MOU, </p><p>and economic package negotiated with the U.S. or Turkey\'s </p><p>role in a post-Saddam Iraq.  Baykal told Congressmen Wexler </p><p>and Whitfield that his party has "no idea about the big </p><p>picture" in Iraq.  CHP M.P. and Foreign Affairs Committee </p><p>member Emin Koc claimed that in the March 1 closed session, </p><p>the GOT failed to answer even the most basic questions from </p><p>CHP on the state of negotiations with the U.S.  Koc suggested </p><p>that AK\'s reluctance to share more information reflected </p><p>Erdogan\'s and Gul\'s overconfidence in their ability to </p><p>deliver AK\'s Parliamentary group.  In a March 4 conversation, </p><p>senior CHP M.P. and long-time pollster Bulent Tanla, who has </p><p>helped to lead the anti-deployment efforts together with </p><p>Islamist columnist Fehmi Koru and others, asserted that AK\'s </p><p>failure to communicate better with CHP directly led to CHP\'s </p><p>decision to vote en bloc against the Parliamentary motion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Vague apologies for Sav </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Reftel reported CHP General Secretary Onder Sav\'s </p><p>March 1 remarks in the open session of Parliament -- carried </p><p>on live television -- in which he called U.S. ships off the </p><p>Turkish coast "ships of the enemy."  Since then CHP M.P.s -- </p><p>including Altay, Koc, and Tanla -- have offered reluctant </p><p>apologies for Sav\'s statement, while professing their </p><p>friendship with the U.S.  Notably, Baykal offered no such </p><p>apology in his meeting with Congressmen Wexler and Whitfield. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Comment: Bleating rings hollow </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>7. (C) CHP\'s continued harping on "international legitimacy" </p><p>and complaints about alleged poor communication from AK </p><p>overshadow what appears to be the party\'s ultimate goal in </p><p>opposing a war in Iraq: humiliating the AK government.  Altay </p><p>self-servingly claimed that if CHP were in power, it would </p><p>support the USG without hesitation.  However, as the party in </p><p>the minority, he averred, "we have to vote against the </p><p>government\'s policies."  Altay hinted that the U.S. should be </p><p>happy to have AK in power during this sensitive time, because </p><p>AK is able to keep a lid on religious groups.  If CHP were in </p><p>power, he said, these groups would be leading huge protests </p><p>against the war and government.  Bottom line: CHP continues </p><p>to play a cynical, negative-value-added game. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
