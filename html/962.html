<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 07 RIYADH 003482 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, INR </p><p>LONDON FOR SUTPHIN, PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  9/23/08 </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PTER, PGOV, PINR, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA:  USAMA BIN LADIN (C-NA8-00989) </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) STATE 171640 (NOTAL)  (B) RIYADH 602 </p><p>       (C) RIYADH 1773   (D) RIYADH 1797  (E) RIYADH 1892 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM ALBERT THIBAULT, REASON 1.5 B. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON EX-SAUDI TERRORIST USAMA BIN </p><p>LADIN, WHICH INCLUDES INPUT FROM CONSULATES DHAHRAN AND JEDDAH, </p><p>IS KEYED TO QUESTIONS POSED IN REF A. </p><p> </p><p>A.   (S)  ISLAMIC LEADERS ADMIRED BY BIN LADIN: </p><p> </p><p>BIN LADIN WAS RAISED IN A CONSERVATIVE WAHHABI MUSLIM FAMILY. </p><p>AS A YOUNG MAN HE REPORTEDLY WAS INFLUENCED BY CONSERVATIVE, NEO- </p><p>SALAFI PREACHER MUHAMMAD BIN SALIH AL-UTHAYMIN, IMAM OF THE GRAND </p><p>MOSQUE IN UNAYZAH AND A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF SENIOR ULAMA. </p><p>DURING HIS YEARS IN AFGHANISTAN, HE DEVELOPED LINKS WITH MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD AND AL-GAMA\'AH AL-ISLAMIYYA </p><p>MOVEMENTS, GROUPS INFLUENCED BY THE WORK OF EGYPTIAN MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD THINKER SAYYID QUTB.  UPON HIS RETURN FROM </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, BIN LADIN WAS TAKEN WITH THE PREACHING OF THE SAUDI </p><p>"AWAKENING MOVEMENT" PREACHERS, ESPECIALLY SAFAR AL-HAWALI AND </p><p>SALMAN AL-AWDAH, ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT HAVE MUCH DIRECT CONTACT </p><p>WITH THEM SINCE HE LIVED OUTSIDE OF SAUDI ARABIA AFTER 1991. </p><p>LIKE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SAUDI RELIGIOUS LEADER MUHAMMAD IBN ABD </p><p>AL-WAHHAB, THESE PREACHERS ARE STRICT INTERPRETERS OF THE </p><p>TEACHINGS OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY HANBALI THEOLOGIAN IBN </p><p>TAYMIYYA, KNOWN FOR HIS LITERALISM IN INTERPRETING THE QUR\'AN, </p><p>OPPOSITION TO INNOVATION, AND VIEW THAT CHRISTIANS AND JEWS </p><p>DISTORTED THEIR SACRED BOOKS.  BIN LADIN FREQUENTLY QUOTES IBN </p><p>TAYMIYYA, ESPECIALLY WHEN JUSTIFYING THE NEED TO FIGHT HERESY IN </p><p>THE ISLAMIC WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>IN A MARCH 1997 INTERVIEW WITH A PAKISTANI JOURNALIST WHO VISITED </p><p>HIS CAMP IN AFGHANISTAN, BIN LADIN WAS ASKED "WHO IS YOUR IDEAL </p><p>PERSONALITY, IN TODAY\'S WORLD?"  BIN LADIN RESPONDED, "SHAYKH </p><p>SALMAN AL-AWDAH WOULD BE MY IDEAL."  SALMAN AL-AWDAH, WHO REMAINS </p><p>IMPRISONED AND REPORTEDLY IS IN FAILING HEALTH, ARGUES THAT THE </p><p>MUSLIM "UMMAH" (NATION) IS IN A STATE OF CRISIS THAT REQUIRES ALL </p><p>MUSLIMS TO TAKE UP AN ARMED STRUGGLE TO SAVE IT.  IN A TAPE </p><p>SMUGGLED FROM PRISON IN 1995, HE DECLARED:  "THE ISLAMIC WORLD </p><p>TODAY, I SAY IT FRANKLY TO EVERY FRIEND AND FOE, ...IS </p><p>TRANSFORMING INTO A FACTORY: A BUSY FACTORY TO PREPARE THE </p><p>FIGHTERS.  THE ONE WHO WILL NOT FIGHT OUT OF FAITH AND </p><p>ENTHUSIASM, YOU WILL FIND HIM COMPELLED TO FIGHT FOR HIS OWN </p><p>SURVIVAL BECAUSE HE HAS NO OTHER WAY.  ... IT IS DEATH THAT GIVES </p><p>LIFE, YES, IT IS JIHAD FOR THE SAKE OF ALLAH, THE OBLIGED FATE OF </p><p>THIS UMMAH.  OTHERWISE IT IS EXTINCTION.  IF THE UMMAH ABANDONED </p><p>JIHAD AND IGNORED IT, THEN ALLAH WILL HIT IT AND PUNISH IT BY </p><p>MAKING IT LOW AMONG THE NATIONS, LIKE THE PROPHET... SAID: IF YOU </p><p>ABANDONED JIHAD, AND BECAME SATISFIED WITH GROWING PLANTS, THEN </p><p>ALLAH WILL CAUSE YOU TO BECOME LOW AMONG THE NATIONS, AND YOU </p><p>WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COME OUT OF IT UNTIL YOU RETURN TO YOUR </p><p>RELIGION AND DECLARE JIHAD FOR THE SAKE OF ALLAH." </p><p> </p><p>MORE RECENTLY BIN LADIN ALSO SPOKE ADMIRINGLY ABOUT A SERMON BY A </p><p>FORMER IMAM OF THE PROPHET\'S MOSQUE IQMADINAH, SHAYKH ALI ABD </p><p>AL-RAHMAN AL-HUTHAYFI.  DURING RAFSANJANI\'S VISIT TO THE </p><p>PROPHET\'S MOSQUE IN FEBRUARY 1998, AL-HUTHAYFI VIRULENTLY </p><p>ATTACKED SHIAS, PROCLAIMED THAT THERE COULD BE NO ACCOMMODATION </p><p>BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND OTHER "UNBELIEVERS," AND </p><p>CRITICIZED THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS IN THE GULF REGION. </p><p> </p><p>B.  (S)  DOES BIN LADIN CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE A RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADER? </p><p> </p><p>WHILE ONLY BIN LADIN HIMSELF CAN DEFINITIVELY ANSWER THIS </p><p>QUESTION, IT WOULD APPEAR FROM HIS STATEMENTS THAT BIN LADIN DOES </p><p>NOT CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE A RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR OR IMAM.  HE </p><p>PRESENTS HIMSELF AS A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS AND COMMITTED "MUJAHID" </p><p>(JIHAD WARRIOR) FIGHTING TO DEFEND THE ISLAMIC "UMMAH" FROM </p><p>HEREQAND THE THREAT  HE BELIEVES IS POSED BY THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>ISRAEL, AND THEIR  ALLIES. </p><p> </p><p>C.  (S) RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS: </p><p> </p><p>USAMA BIN LADIN DOES NOT HAVE CONVENTIONAL ISLAMIC CREDENTIALS. </p><p>THAT IS TO SAY, HE DID NOT PURSUE FORMAL ISLAMIC STUDIES IN ANY </p><p>RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION OR EVEN INDEPENDENTLY UNDER A RELIGIOUS </p><p>SCHOLAR.  HE IS HOWEVER, A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN WHO IS MORE </p><p>INTERESTED IN ACTION THAN IN CONTEMPLATION.   AS FAR AS WE CAN </p><p>DISCERN (NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT A POLL AMONG HIS </p><p>FOLLOWERS), HE IS VIEWED BY HIS FOLLOWERS NOT AS A RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADER BUT AS A MUSLIM WARRIOR LEADING THE FIGHT TO PROTECT AND </p><p>DEFEND THE ISLAMIC "UMMAH."  EVEN MANY SAUDIS WHO BELIEVE HE IS </p><p>MISGUIDED ACKNOWLEDGE HIS RELIGIOUS FERVOR; MANY WHO DEPLORE HIS </p><p>CALL FOR VIOLENCE NEVERTHELESS SEE HIS REACTION TO U.S. POLICIES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY ITS SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AS "UNDERSTANDABLE." </p><p> </p><p>D.  (S) DOES BIN LADIN CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE THE LEADER OR </p><p>MERELY ONE OF MANY LEADERS OF A WORLDWIDE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT? </p><p> </p><p>IN STATEMENTS MADE FOR WESTERN CONSUMPTION, BIN LADIN HAS BEEN AT </p><p>PAINS TO EMPHASIZE THAT DESPITE HIS ISOLATION IN AFGHANISTAN, HE </p><p>IS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>E.  (S) BIN LADIN\'S OBJECTIVES: </p><p> </p><p>BIN LADIN\'S IMMEDIATE STATED OBJECTIVE IS THE EXPULSION OF U.S. </p><p>TROOPS FROM SAUDI ARABIA, THE ARABIAN PENINSULA, AND ALL MUSLIM </p><p>COUNTRIES.  BEYOND THAT GOAL, IN MARCH 1997, BIN LADIN TOLD A </p><p>PAKISTANI JOURNALIST THAT "MUSLIMS NEED A LEADER WHO CAN UNITE </p><p>THEM AND ESTABLISH A GOVERNMENT WHICH FOLLOWS THE RULE OF THE </p><p>CALIPHS.  THE RULE OF THE CALIPHS WILL BEGIN FROM AFGHANISTAN. </p><p>IT WILL ADOPT INTEREST-FREE BANKING.  THE RULE OF ALLAH WILL BE </p><p>ESTABLISHED.  WE ARE AGAINST COMMUNISM BUT WE ARE ALSO AGAINST </p><p>CAPITALISM.  THE CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH IN JUST A FEW HANDS IS </p><p>UNISLAMIC."  HE DOES NOT SPECIFY WHO IS QUALIFIED TO BECOME A </p><p>CALIPH, OR HOW HIS MOVEMENT WILL SPREAD FROM AFGHANISTAN TO THE </p><p>REST OF THE MUSLIM WORLD.  BIN LADIN\'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS TEND TO </p><p>BE MORE EXHORTATORY THAN PRESCRIPTIVE IN NATURE; HE SPEAKS AS A </p><p>WARRIOR URGING HIS FOLLOWERS TO RISE UP AGAINST THE UNITED STATES </p><p>AND OTHER ENEMIES OF ISLAM AND NOT AS A REVOLUTIONARY WITH A </p><p>PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE.  IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER HE SEEKS A COMPLETE OVERTHROW OF THE </p><p>MONARCHY IN SAUDI ARABIA.  HE HAS CHARGED THE KING AND OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE AL SAUD WITH HERESY, BUT HAS ALSO SAID THAT "MANY </p><p>PRINCES SHARE THE PUBLIC\'S CONCERN AND PRIVATELY VOICE OPPOSITION </p><p>TO WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF TERROR, </p><p>REPRESSION, AND CORRUPTION," IMPLYING, PERHAPS, THAT ONE OF THEM </p><p>MIGHT BE QUALIFIED TO RULE.  BIN LADIN\'S FIXATION WITH EXPELLING </p><p>JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND OTHER UNBELIEVERS FROM MUSLIM LANDS SUGGESTS </p><p>THAT HE BELIEVES THAT ONCE THEY ARE GONE, ALL PROBLEMS FACED BY </p><p>THE MUSLIM "UMMAH" WILL DISAPPEAR. </p><p> </p><p>F.  (S) TIES WITH HIS FAMILY: </p><p> </p><p>MEMBERS OF BIN LADIN\'S FAMILY HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY HAVE NOT HAD </p><p>CONTACTS WITH HIM SINCE 1996, WHEN BIN LADIN SENT HIS HALF- </p><p>BROTHER BAKR WORD THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO RETURN TO SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA IF HIS FAMILY WOULD SECURE THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN </p><p>POLITICAL PRISONERS.  THE FAMILY REFUSED.  THE BIN LADIN FAMILY\'S </p><p>CONTINUED STRONG TIES WITH THE KING AND OTHER ROYAL FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS ARE GOOD INDICATORS THAT THERE IS PROBABLY VERY LITTLE </p><p>CONTACT WITH USAMA.  FROM TIME TO TIME INDIVIDUAL BROTHERS HAVE </p><p>CONTACTED USAMA IN FUTILE EFFORTS TO PERSUADE HIM TO GIVE UP HIS </p><p>WAYS AND RETURN TO THE KINGDOM.  HOWEVER, BY NOW THE FAMILY HAS </p><p>LARGELY GIVEN UP ON HIM.  AS ONE OF HIS BROTHERS CONFIDED TO AN </p><p>EMBOFF LATE LAST YEAR, "AS FAR AS THE FAMILY IS CONCERNED, USAMA </p><p>IS DEAD, AND IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF HE WERE KILLED." </p><p> </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, BUSINESSMEN IN PROMINENT JEDDAH </p><p>MERCHANT FAMILIES CONCEDE THAT WHILE THE BIN LADIN FAMILY HAS </p><p>DISAVOWED USAMA, BLOOD TIES CANNOT BE ENTIRELY DENIED, AND THEY </p><p>HAVE MENTIONED HIS CONNECTIONS WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS WHO </p><p>LIVE IN JEDDAH.  JAMAL KHASHOGGI, AN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT SPECIALIST </p><p>FOR "AL-HAYAT" NEWSPAPER, TOLD US RECENTLY THAT USAMA\'S SON </p><p>ABDALLAH LIVES IN JEDDAH, BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUSPECT </p><p>USAMA\'S RELATIVES OF HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>ANOTHER ONE OF USAMA\'S ELDER BROTHERS, YAHYA BIN LADIN, RECENTLY </p><p>TOLD CONSULATE JEDDAH CONTACTS THAT HE FELT HE HAD MADE TWO </p><p>STRATEGIC MISTAKES WITH RESPECT TO HIS YOUNGER SIBLING.  FIRST, </p><p>HE HAD NOT OFFERED HIM A POSITION IN THE FAMILY COMPANY, AND </p><p>SECOND, HE DID NOT GO TO SUDAN FOUR YEARS AGO TO PERSUADE USAMA </p><p>TO COME BACK TO SAUDI ARABIA BEFORE HE "TURNED AWAY FROM THE </p><p>FOLD."  ANOTHER CONTACT, A SAUDI ISLAMIC MOVEMENT SPECIALIST WHO </p><p>HAS LONG KNOWN USAMA, CLAIMS USAMA NOW HAS NOT MORE THAN 50 </p><p>PEOPLE AROUND HIM. </p><p> </p><p>G.  (S) RELATIONS WITH OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS AND RELATIONS WITH </p><p>SHIA DISSIDENTS: </p><p> </p><p>WHILE BIN LADIN HAS ATTEMPTED TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AS ONE MEMBER IN </p><p>A WORLDWIDE ALLIANCE OF MUSLIM ORGANIZATIONS, A LOOK AT WHICH </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY COOPERATE WITH HIM REVEALS THAT HIS </p><p>NETWORK IS PROBABLY NOT AS BROAD AS BIN LADIN WOULD LIKE TO HAVE </p><p>US THINK.  SINCE HIS EARLY DAYS IN AFGHANISTAN, HE HAS HAD LINKS </p><p>WITH MEMBERS OF THE EGYPTIAN AL-GAMA\'AH AL-ISLAMIYYA (RIFA\'I </p><p>AHMAD TAHA, "AMIR" OF THE GROUP, AND MUHAMMAD SHAWQI AL-ISLAMBULI </p><p>AND MUSTAFA HAMZAH (AKA ABU-HAZIM) HAVE REPORTEDLY BEEN LIVING IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN WITH BIN LADIN) AND THE ISLAMIC JIHAD (AYMAN AL- </p><p>ZAWAHIRI, THE EGYPTIAN JIHAD "AMIR," IS REPORTEDLY HIS CLOSEST </p><p>ASSOCIATE.)   DURING THE AFGHANISTAN WAR, BIN LADIN COLLABORATED </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THE LATE PALESTINIAN ISLAMIST ABDALLAH AZZAM IN </p><p>SETTING UP THE "JIHAD AND RELIEF" GUEST HOUSE IN PESHAWAR TO </p><p>RECEIVE MUJAHIDEEN VOLUNTEERS ON THEIR WAY TO AFGHANISTAN. </p><p>DURING THIS TIME, IN ADDITION TO FINANCING RECRUITMENT, TRAINING </p><p>AND SUPPORT OF THE ARAB VOLUNTEERS, BIN LADIN IS SAID TO HAVE </p><p>PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR GROUPS SUCH AS HAMAS AND THE YEMENI ISLAMIC </p><p>JIHAD GROUP HEADED BY SHAYKH ZINDANI.  DURING HIS TIME IN SUDAN, </p><p>BIN LADIN, AS A GUEST OF HASAN TURABI, IS SAID TO HAVE DEVELOPED </p><p>LINKS WITH THE ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT IN ALGERIA.  SINCE THEN </p><p>BIN LADIN HAS BEEN A BENEFACTOR TO ISLAMIC MILITANT GROUPS IN </p><p>PAKISTAN, TAJIKISTAN, BOSNIA AND JORDAN.  HIS ROLE VIS A VIS MOST </p><p>OF THESE GROUPS, HOWEVER, APPEARS TO BE LIMITED TO THAT OF </p><p>FINANCIER AND SUPPORTER; HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE FORGING A </p><p>WORLDWIDE ALLIANCE BETWEEN THESE QUITE DISPARATE GROUPS.  THE SO- </p><p>CALLED FATWA URGING MUSLIMS TO "KILL AMERICANS EVERYWHERE" ISSUED </p><p>IN FEBRUARY 1998 WAS SIGNED ONLY BY AYMAN AL-ZAWAHIRI OF THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN JIHAD, RIFA\'I AHMAD TAHA OF THE AL-GAMA\'AH AL-ISLAMIYYA, </p><p>SHAYKH MIR HAMZA, SECRETARY OF THE JAMIAT-UL-ULAMA-E-PAKISTAN, </p><p>AND FAZLUL RAHMAN, AMIR OF THE JIHAD MOVEMENT IN BANGLADESH. </p><p>OTHER MEMBERS OF THE JAMIAT-UL-ULAMA-E-PAKISTAN SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>DISAVOWED ANY LINKS WITH BIN LADIN. THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS THAT </p><p>AL-GAMA\'AH AL-ISLAMIYYA HAVE DISTANCED THEMSELVES FROM BIN LADIN. </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT BIN LADIN HAS LINKS WITH SHIA </p><p>DISSIDENTS IN SAUDI ARABIA, AND WE SUSPECT THAT, GIVEN THE </p><p>THEOLOGICAL SCHISMS BETWEEN THE SAUDI SUNNI RADICALS AND THE </p><p>SHIA, BIN LADIN WOULD NOT BE INCLINED TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH </p><p>THEM.  BIN LADIN\'S APPLAUSE FOR FORMER MEDINA IMAM AL-HUTHAYFI\'S </p><p>VERY PUBLIC INSULT OF IRANIAN EX-PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI IS LIKELY A </p><p>GOOD INDICATOR OF HIS THINKING ON RELATIONS WITH THE SHIA IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA AND IN IRAN.  SHIA IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE VIEW BIN </p><p>LADIN AND HIS IDEOLOGY AS ANTI-SHIA. </p><p> </p><p>H.  (S)  CONTACTS WITH NON-MUSLIM (INCLUDING SECULAR) GROUPS </p><p>OPPOSED TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE WEST: </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SUCH CONTACTS, AND GIVEN BIN LADIN\'S </p><p>FANATICISM AND INTENSE INTOLERANCE OF NON-MUSLIMS, WE DOUBT THAT </p><p>HE IS INTERESTED IN MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH NON-MUSLIMS. </p><p> </p><p>I.  (S) SYMPATHY TOWARDS BIN LADIN IN SAUDI INSTITUTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY IS UNABLE TO CONDUCT SURVEYS TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF </p><p>SYMPATHY TOWARDS BIN LADIN IN VARIOUS SAUDI INSTITUTIONS AND </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES.  HOWEVER, BASED ON OUR CONTACTS WITH SAUDIS IN </p><p>THESE INSTITUTIONS, EMBASSY PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>LIKELY SAUDI SYMPATHY FOR BIN LADIN: </p><p> </p><p>THE MILITARY: LOW </p><p> </p><p>THE NATIONAL GUARD:  LOW </p><p> </p><p>MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR:  LOW </p><p> </p><p>THE ULAMA: HIGH IN SOME QUARTERS, I.E., AMONG NEO-SALAFIS, BUT </p><p>NOT AMONG THE MAINSTREAM IMAMS. </p><p> </p><p>THE ROYAL DIWAN: LOW. IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S </p><p>MINIONS ARE INTERESTED IN BITING THE HANDS THAT FEED THEM. </p><p> </p><p>THE MAJLIS AL-SHURA:  LOW, ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE CONSERVATIVE </p><p>RELIGIOUS MEMBERS WERE SYMPATHETIC TO CALLS BY THE AWAKENING </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR A STRICTER APPLICATION OF SHARIA LAW. </p><p> </p><p>ACADEMIA:  MEDIUM; SYMPATHY, IF NOT AGREEMENT WITH BIN LADIN\'S </p><p>METHODS, MAY BE HIGHER AMONG CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC SCHOLARS IN </p><p>INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS IMAM MUHAMMAD BIN SAUD UNIVERSITY, WHOSE </p><p>MEMBERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT AND OTHER </p><p>OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES.  UNIVERSITY FACULTY ALSO INCLUDE WESTERN </p><p>EDUCATED LIBERALS WHOSE SYMPATHY IS LOW. </p><p> </p><p>ARAB EXPATRIATES:  LOW, ALTHOUGH POSSIBLY HIGHER AMONG YEMENIS </p><p>AND SUDANESE. </p><p> </p><p>BUSINESSMEN: MIXED.  SOME SYMPATHY.  IN GENERAL, JEDDAH MERCHANT </p><p>FAMILIES, MANY OF WHOSE MEMBERS KNOW USAMA FROM HIS YOUNGER DAYS, </p><p>HAVE EMPHASIZED TO US THAT THE U.S. MEDIA IS ELEVATING USAMA AND </p><p>GIVING HIM A POWER HE NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD OTHERWISE.  A NUMBER </p><p>HAVE LAMENTED THAT THE STALEMATE IN THE PEACE PROCESS AND WHAT IS </p><p>PERCEIVED AS UNLIMITED SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL REGARDLESS OF ITS </p><p>ACTIONS HAS LED SOME SAUDIS TO BE MORE TOLERANT OF USAMA THAN </p><p>THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE BE. </p><p> </p><p>WOMEN: EXTREMELY LOW.  BIN LADIN AND THE CLERICS HE ADMIRES ARE </p><p>OPPOSED TO WOMEN\'S RIGHTS; THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT SEEMS TO FIND </p><p>FEW ADHERENTS AMONG SAUDI WOMEN. </p><p> </p><p>THE SAUDI PUBLIC AT LARGE:  BIN LADIN\'S CALL TO VIOLENCE IS NOT </p><p>ONE THAT RESONATES WITH MOST SAUDIS.  THE ISLAMIC INJUNCTION </p><p>AGAINST TAKING ACTIONS WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO "FITNA" (SOCIAL CHAOS) </p><p>IS DEEPLY INGRAINED IN THIS SOCIETY.  INTERESTINGLY, OVER THE </p><p>LAST YEAR OR SO, THE RELIGIOUS DEBATE ABOUT WHEN ISLAMIC LAW </p><p>ALLOWS FOR REMOVAL OF A MUSLIM LEADER HAS BEEN PUBLICLY AIRED, </p><p>SUGGESTING A REACTION TO CHARGES BY BIN LADIN AND OPPOSITION </p><p>MEMBERS THAT THE KING AND THE AL SAUD HAVE UNDERTAKEN HERETICAL </p><p>ACTS AND MUST BE REMOVED FROM POWER.  IN A LENGTHY INTERVIEW, </p><p>MAJLIS AL-SHURA PRESIDENT AND SENIOR SCHOLAR SHAYKH BIN JUBAYR </p><p>OPINED THAT REMOVING A RULER IS ALLOWABLE ONLY UNDER THE </p><p>NARROWEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES, AND GRAND MUFTI SHAYKH BIN BAZ ISSUED </p><p>A FATWA REMINDING MUSLIMS THAT IN MOST INSTANCES IT IS FORBIDDEN. </p><p>WE THINK THAT MOST SAUDIS PROBABLY AGREE. </p><p> </p><p>HOWEVER, BIN LADIN\'S STATEMENTS REFLECT THE FRUSTRATION THAT MANY </p><p>MIDDLE CLASS SAUDIS FEEL ABOUT THEIR ECONOMIC SITUATION, </p><p>FRUSTRATION THAT WILL GROW AS PER CAPITA INCOMES DECLINE.  IN A </p><p>1996 INTERVIEW BIN LADIN CORRECTLY OBSERVED THAT SAUDIS WONDER </p><p>"IS OURS REALLY THE WORLD\'S LARGEST OIL EXPORTING COUNTRY?"  IN </p><p>ADDITION, HIS ANTIPATHY TOWARDS U.S. POLICY THAT IS SUPPORTIVE OF </p><p>ISRAEL IS WIDELY SHARED BY MOST SAUDIS.  THERE IS A CERTAIN </p><p>RESPECT FOR BIN LADIN AS A MAN MOTIVATED BY RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLE, </p><p>AND, WHILE MOST SAUDIS WOULD NOT FOLLOW HIM, MANY SHARE HIS </p><p>FRUSTRATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE RELIGIOUS </p><p>WEEKLY, "AL MUSLIMUN," WHO KNOWS USAMA, TOLD US HE RESPECTS HIM </p><p>FOR HIS ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE WAR AGAINST THE USSR, NOTING THAT HE </p><p>BUILT SOME USEFUL TUNNELS THROUGH THE AFGHAN MOUNTAINS.  AFTER </p><p>THE BOMBINGS OF EMBASSIES NAIROBI AND DAR ES-SALAAM, EMBOFFS </p><p>HEARD FROM MANY SAUDI CONTACTS WHO CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS BUT ALSO </p><p>FELT THEY WERE INEVITABLE GIVEN WHAT THEY SEE AS AMERICA\'S </p><p>UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT OF ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO JAMAL KHASHOGGI, AN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT SPECIALIST FOR </p><p>"AL HAYAT" NEWSPAPER, FEW PEOPLE IN JEDDAH DISLIKE USAMA, AND </p><p>SOME CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HIM BECAUSE THEY ARE FED UP WITH THE </p><p>AMERICAN PRESENCE/POLICY IN THE REGION.  KHASHOGGI SAID THAT MANY </p><p>PEOPLE CONSIDER USAMA BIN LADIN AS THE "CHE GUEVARA" OF THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD.  HE SAID THAT SOME HOPE THAT USAMA WILL DIE IN BATTLE SO </p><p>THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT HAVE TO SUFFER THE "HUMILIATION" OF SEEING </p><p>HIM TRANSPORTED IN HANDCUFFS TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>J.  (S) IS BIN LADIN VIEWED AS A TERRORIST OR AS AN ISLAMIC </p><p>IDEOLOGUE? </p><p> </p><p>SEE ABOVE.  REACTION VARIES. </p><p> </p><p>K.  (S) HOW IS BIN LADIN\'S MESSAGE DISSEMINATED? </p><p> </p><p>THE INTERNET, INTERNATIONAL ARAB PRESS, AND SATELLITE TELEVISION </p><p>GUARANTEE THE DISSEMINATION OF BIN LADIN\'S MESSAGES.  THE INTENSE </p><p>FOCUS OF THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA ON BIN LADIN FOLLOWING THE </p><p>BOMBINGS OF EMBASSIES NAIROBI AND DAR ES-SALAAM HAS ASSURED BIN </p><p>LADIN\'S NOTORIETY AMONG EVEN THE MOST ISOLATED SAUDIS. </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARABIC JOURNALS SUCH AS AL-HAYAT, AL-SHARQ AL- </p><p>AWSAT, AND AL-QUDS AL-ARABI ARE ALSO WIDELY READ HERE. </p><p> </p><p>L.  (S) WHAT COMMUNICATION DOES BIN LADIN HAVE WITH SAUDI </p><p>SOCIETY? </p><p> </p><p>SEE ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>M.  (S) SAUDI PUBLIC OR PRIVATE FUNDING OF BIN LADIN? </p><p> </p><p>THE SAG DOES NOT PROVIDE FUNDS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO BIN </p><p>LADIN OR HIS FOLLOWERS THROUGH ANY ORGANIZATION.  THE SAG </p><p>MONITORS PRIVATE SAUDI DONATIONS TO PRIVATE CHARITIES, BUT IT IS </p><p>LIKELY THAT SOME MONEY MAKES ITS WAY TO ORGANIZATIONS WITH LINKS </p><p>TO BIN LADIN.  FOR EXAMPLE, ACCORDING TO "AL-HAYAT" ISLAMIC </p><p>MOVEMENT SPECIALIST JAMAL KHASHOGGI, JIHAD IS ONE OF THE </p><p>LEGITIMATE USES FOR ZAKAT, THE MANDATORY ISLAMIC TAX.  SAUDI </p><p>GRAND MUFTI SHAYKH BIN BAZ HAS ISSUED A NUMBER OF FATWAS SAYING </p><p>THAT ZAKAT CAN BE GIVEN IN FOR JIHAD IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, </p><p>MOST RECENTLY FOR EXAMPLE, TO SUPPORT THE "JIHAD" IN KASHMIR. </p><p>BIN LADIN IS KNOWN TO HAVE LINKS WITH GROUPS IN KASHMIR. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS WIDELY RUMORED IN THE BUSINESS AND BANKING COMMUNITY IN </p><p>RIYADH THAT THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF USAMA\'S MONEY WAS A $300 </p><p>MILLION SETTLEMENT HE OBTAINED WHEN HIS FAMILY BOUGHT OUT HIS </p><p>SHARE IN THE MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR BIN LADIN GROUP CONGLOMERATE. </p><p> </p><p>N.  (S)  STATUS OF THE BIN LADIN FAMILY FOLLOWING BOMBINGS: </p><p> </p><p>THE BIN LADIN FAMILY\'S STATUS HAS NOT CHANGED.  IT HAS PUBLICLY </p><p>DISASSOCIATED ITSELF FROM USAMA, AND REMAINS CLOSELY LINKED TO </p><p>THE ROYAL FAMILY AND HIGHLY RESPECTED IN BUSINESS CIRCLES. </p><p> </p><p>O.  (S)  ACCOMMODATION WITH THE AL SAUD: </p><p> </p><p>BIN LADIN HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HE WOULD REACH AN </p><p>"ACCOMMODATION" WITH THE AL SAUD ONLY IF THEY MET HIS CONDITIONS </p><p>OF EXPELLING U.S. TROOPS FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND IMPLEMENTING THE </p><p>ISLAMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS HE AND THE AWAKENING PREACHERS HAVE </p><p>DEMANDED. </p><p> </p><p>P.  (S)  CONNECTIONS/OVERLAP BETWEEN BIN LADIN\'S MESSAGE AND </p><p>MAINSTREAM SAUDI ULAMA: </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS NOT MUCH OVERLAP BETWEEN BIN LADIN, WHO IS A RADICAL </p><p>ACTIVIST, AND THE "MAINSTREAM" ULAMA, WHOSE JOB IS TO LEGITIMIZE </p><p>AL SAUD RULE, EXCEPT REGARDING THE ISSUE OF ISRAEL, WHERE INTENSE </p><p>FRUSTRATION OVER LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS IS LEADING </p><p>MANY MEMBERS OF THE ULAMA TO RECONSIDER THEIR POSITION THAT </p><p>ACCOMMODATION WITH ISRAEL IS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>Q.  (S)  APPEAL OF THE ISLAMIC "AWAKENING" MOVEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT\'S APPEAL REACHES BEYOND THE UNEMPLOYED AND </p><p>THE RELIGIOUS ELITE.  A LOOK AT WHO SIGNED THE 1992 "MEMORANDUM </p><p>OF ADVICE" TO KING FAHD REVEALS A COALITION OF CLERICS, ACADEMICS </p><p>(INCLUDING WESTERN-TRAINED SCHOLARS AND SCIENTISTS), AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS AND LEGAL SCHOLARS THROUGHOUT SAUDI ARABIA.  RIOTS IN </p><p>BURAYDA FOLLOWING THE FIRST ARREST OF SALMAN AL-AWDAH </p><p>DEMONSTRATED THE WIDE POPULAR FOLLOWING HE ENJOYS IN THE QASSIM </p><p>REGION.  THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT IS IN MANY WAYS A REACTION TO THE </p><p>IMMENSE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES --AND ATTENDANT </p><p>DISLOCATIONS-- THAT SAUDI ARABIA HAS UNDERGONE IN THE LAST THIRTY </p><p>YEARS.  IT IS ALSO A RESULT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S ECONOMIC POLICY </p><p>FAILURES, THE MILITARY  INADEQUACIES REVEALED BY THE GULF WAR, </p><p>AND A RELIGIOUSLY-BASED EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT HAS FAILED TO TRAIN </p><p>SAUDI YOUTH TO FUNCTION IN A MODERN ECONOMY.  IN THE FACE OF </p><p>DECLINING STANDARDS OF LIVING, GROWING UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE </p><p>COMPLEXITIES IMPOSED BY MODERNIZATION, THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT\'S </p><p>SIMPLE PRESCRIPTION OF A RETURN TO CORE ISLAMIC VALUES HAS WIDE, </p><p>AND WE BELIEVE, GROWING APPEAL, DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT\'S MASSIVE </p><p>EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS THE MOVEMENT.  IT IS BOTH BROADER-BASED AND </p><p>DEEPER IN ITS SUPPORT THAN BIN LADIN\'S "AL-QA\'IDAH." </p><p> </p><p>R.  (S)  COMMUNICATIONS OF JAILED PREACHERS AL-AWDAH AND AL- </p><p>HAWALI WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD: </p><p> </p><p>AS FAR AS WE ARE ABLE TO DISCERN, THE PREACHERS\' COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED OF LATE.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE MANAGED TO SMUGGLE </p><p>OUT ANY LETTERS OR TAPED MESSAGES TO THEIR SUPPORTERS IN THE LAST </p><p>YEAR, WHEREAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR INCARCERATION, REPORTS OF </p><p>SUCH MESSAGES APPEARED PERIODICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>S.  (S)  EXPECTATIONS AMONG SUPPORTERS OF AL-AWDAH AND AL-HAWALI </p><p>THAT THE PREACHERS WILL NOT RENOUNCE THEIR BELIEFS, AND WILL BE </p><p>RELEASED: </p><p> </p><p>THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY EXPECTATION THAT EITHER AL-AWDAH </p><p>OR AL-HAWALI WILL RENOUNCE HIS BELIEFS IN EXCHANGE FOR FREEDOM. </p><p>HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT ANOTHER FIREBRAND PREACHER, SHAYKH AYIDH AL- </p><p>QARNI, WAS RELEASED ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER AWAKENING PREACHERS </p><p>AND SYMPATHIZERS LAST RAMADAN (RIYADH 292), IT IS POSSIBLE THAT </p><p>SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THEIR RELEASE MIGHT </p><p>BE REACHED.  APPARENTLY BOTH PREACHERS ARE IN POOR HEALTH, AND IT </p><p>IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD BE RELEASED FOR HEALTH REASONS. </p><p> </p><p>T.  (S)  COMMON SAUDI VIEW OF CHRISTIANS/JEWS: </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE PURITANICAL AND XENOPHOBIC WAHHABI BRAND OF </p><p>ISLAM PRACTICED IN SAUDI ARABIA, ALL NON-MUSLIMS ARE CONSIDERED </p><p>TO BE "UNBELIEVERS."  SOPHISTICATED SCHOLARS WILL EXPLAIN THAT </p><p>THIS MEANS THAT NON-MUSLIMS ARE CONSIDERED "UNBELIEVERS" VIS A </p><p>VIS THE MESSAGE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD, BUT THAT CHRISTIANS AND </p><p>JEWS, AS "PEOPLE OF THE BOOK," ARE DUE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION </p><p>SINCE THEY WORSHIP THE SAME GOD AND FOLLOW MANY OF THE SAME </p><p>PROPHETS.  LESS SOPHISTICATED SAUDIS TEND TO SIMPLY VIEW ALL NON- </p><p>MUSLIMS AS UNBELIEVERS WITHOUT MAKING THIS DISTINCTION.  EDUCATED </p><p>SAUDIS WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE WEST TEND NOT TO BE TROUBLED </p><p>BY THIS, BUT SOME CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS SAUDIS ARE CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT DEALING WITH NON-MUSLIMS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WONDER IF </p><p>IT IS PROPER TO USE THE TRADITIONAL ISLAMIC GREETING, "PEACE BE </p><p>UPON YOU," WITH A NON-MUSLIM.   GROWING FRUSTRATION WITH THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS AND THE U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE AND THE DAMAGE TO </p><p>IRAQI SOCIETY AS A RESULT OF EIGHT YEARS OF U.N. SANCTIONS ALSO </p><p>COMPLICATE VIEWS OF JEWS AND CHRISTIANS; A WIDELY SHARED BELIEF </p><p>IS THAT THE U.S. INABILITY TO PERSUADE ISRAEL TO MAKE CONCESSIONS </p><p>IN THE PEACE PROCESS OR REMOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM POWER ARE </p><p>ACTUALLY INTENTIONAL AND STEM FROM AN INNATE HOSTILITY TO THE </p><p>MUSLIM WORLD.  THIS BELIEF IS SKILLFULLY EXPLOITED BY PEOPLE LIKE </p><p>BIN LADIN. </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS A DEBATE AMONG SAUDI SCHOLARS ABOUT CONTACT WITH NON- </p><p>MUSLIMS, FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER MUSLIMS SHOULD VISIT NON-MUSLIM </p><p>COUNTRIES, AND WHETHER CHRISTIANS AND JEWS TODAY CAN BE </p><p>CONSIDERED "PEOPLE OF THE BOOK."   AT THE HEART OF THE DEBATE ARE </p><p>TWO SAYINGS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD:  FIRST, "I WILL </p><p>MOVE THE JEWS AND THE CHRISTIANS OUT OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA AND </p><p>I WILL LEAVE ONLY MUSLIMS IN IT."  AND SECOND, "THERE CANNOT BE </p><p>TWO RELIGIONS IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA."  THE FIRST IS A SAYING </p><p>WHOSE AUTHENTICITY IS WELL-DOCUMENTED AND ACCEPTED BY MOST MUSLIM </p><p>SCHOLARS; THE SECOND IS CONSIDERED FLAWED SINCE IT IS MISSING </p><p>SOME OF THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED FOR COMPLETE AUTHENTICATION. </p><p>USAMA BIN LADIN AND THE AWAKENING PREACHERS POINT TO THE FIRST </p><p>SAYING AS THE BASIS FOR THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENCE OF NON- </p><p>MUSLIM TROOPS IN THE KINGDOM.  SOME CONSERVATIVE CLERICS SAY IT </p><p>MEANS THAT JEWS AND CHRISTIANS DISTORTED THEIR HOLY BOOKS TO THE </p><p>POINT THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED "PEOPLE OF THE BOOK" </p><p>WORTHY OF SPECIAL TREATMENT, AND THEREFORE MUST BE REMOVED FROM </p><p>THE KINGDOM.  SOME SCHOLARS, SUCH AS FORMER MADINAH IMAM SHAYKH </p><p>AL-HUTHAYFI, USE THIS SAYING TO SUPPORT THEIR CONTENTION THAT </p><p>THERE CAN BE NO ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND JEWS AND </p><p>CHRISTIANS.  MORE TOLERANT SCHOLARS SAY THAT THIS SAYING MUST BE </p><p>CONSIDERED IN ITS CONTEXT, THAT THE PROPHET WAS REFERRING TO </p><p>JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN FIGHTERS AND WAS NOT REFERRING TO ALL JEWS </p><p>AND CHRISTIANS.  THE SECOND SAYING IS WHAT MANY CONSERVATIVE </p><p>SCHOLARS CONSIDER TO BE THE BASIS FOR THE INJUNCTION AGAINST </p><p>PUBLIC NON-MUSLIM WORSHIP IN THE KINGDOM. </p><p> </p><p>U.  (S)  DOES SAG TOLERANCE OF PRIVATE NON-MUSLIM WORSHIP </p><p>EXACERBATE ANTI-CHRISTIAN, ANTI-AMERICAN FEELINGS AMONG SAUDIS? </p><p> </p><p>THE SAG\'S MORE TOLERANT POLICY HAS NOT BEEN IN EFFECT FOR VERY </p><p>LONG AND IS NOT PUBLICIZED, SO IT IS PERHAPS TOO EARLY TO </p><p>DETERMINE IF A BACKLASH HAS DEVELOPED.  THUS FAR, EMBASSY HAS NO </p><p>EVIDENCE OF AN INCREASE IN ANTI-CHRISTIAN OR ANTI-AMERICAN </p><p>FEELINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SAG TOLERANCE OF PRIVATE NON-MUSLIM </p><p>WORSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>V.  (S)  SHIFT IN TONE OR CONTENT OF AVERAGE FRIDAY SERMON OVER </p><p>THE LAST FIVE YEARS: </p><p> </p><p>SINCE THE SAG CRACK-DOWN ON THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN IN </p><p>1994, FRIDAY SERMONS HAVE BEEN LARGELY DE-POLITICIZED.  THE SAG\'S </p><p>RE-ORGANIZATION OF THE RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT IN 1994 PUT THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF ISLAMIC AFFAIRS IN CHARGE OF IMAMS AND THE CONTENT OF </p><p>SERMONS, STRICTLY LIMITING THE ABILITY OF ANY PREACHER TO DO </p><p>ANYTHING BUT TOE THE AL SAUD LINE.  POLITICAL TOPICS OCCASIONALLY </p><p>COME UP, AS IN THE CASE OF THE PUBLIC INSULT OF FORMER IRANIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI AT THE PROPHET\'S MOSQUE IN MADINAH, BUT </p><p>IMAMS WHO STRAY FROM THEIR APPROVED TEXT RARELY GET A SECOND </p><p>CHANCE.  ON THE SOCIAL FRONT, HOWEVER, IMAMS ARE GIVEN MUCH MORE </p><p>FREEDOM, AND TOPICS SUCH AS THE ROLE OF WOMEN, TREATMENT OF </p><p>SERVANTS, PROPER BEHAVIOR DURING RAMADAN, FOREIGN TRAVEL, </p><p>CONTACTS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN, ETC., ARE VIGOROUSLY DEBATED FROM </p><p>PULPITS AROUND THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>FOWLER </p><p></p></div>
