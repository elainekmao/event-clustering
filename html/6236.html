<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000648 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN,EB/TRA,L </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR HOMELAND SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>PASS DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY </p><p>CUSTOMS (DHS) FOR JOE O\'GORMAN </p><p>INS (DHS) FOR ELIZABETH TISDALE </p><p>TSA FOR SUSAN WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ASEC, EAIR, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: IMPLEMENTING THE AVIATION PRE-CLEARANCE AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH CANADA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is an action request.  Action request in paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. After lengthy negotiations, late last year the U.S. and </p><p>Canada concluded an aviation preclearance agreement </p><p>that,among other items, provides increased protection for </p><p>Department of Homeland Security inspection officers (formerly </p><p>Customs,INS,and APHIS officers) working at Canadian airports. </p><p>At the request of the U.S., the agreement required that the </p><p>U.S. grant reciprocity to Canada before it could be brought </p><p>into force.   We understand the provision providing </p><p>reciprocity was part of the omnibus appropriations bill which </p><p>became law in February, and that the only formal step </p><p>required to bring the agreement into force is an exchange of </p><p>notes between the sides. </p><p> </p><p>3. Canadian Foreign Minister Graham wrote to Ambassador </p><p>Cellucci in January expressing the GOC\'s desire to bring the </p><p>agreement into force as soon as the reciprocity provision </p><p>became law (text below). A DFAIT official, Bruce Levy, told </p><p>us March 4 that Canada\'s Customs and Immigration Ministries </p><p>and their U.S. counterparts were developing Standard </p><p>Operating Procedures (SOPS) related to the agreement.  Levy </p><p>said it was his understanding that completion of the SOPS was </p><p>not requireed to bring the agreement into force, but that the </p><p>SOPS were near completion. </p><p> </p><p>4. Levy also said that the GOC must complete a couple of </p><p>formal, internal steps in order to exchange notes that </p><p>establish the date the agreement goes into force.  The GOC </p><p>would like to know USG thinking on an appropriate date so </p><p>that it can take these internal steps. We note that Secretary </p><p>Ridge and Deputy Prime Minister Manley are expected to meet </p><p>in late March or early April.  It might be appropriate to </p><p>have the agreement go into force in connection with this </p><p>meeting. </p><p> </p><p>5. Action Request:  Please inform us of desired date for new </p><p>aviation preclearance agreement with Canada to enter into </p><p>force so we can provide this to the GOC. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Letter from Foreign Minister Graham to Ambassador </p><p>Cellucci: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>January 22,2003 </p><p> </p><p>Excellency: </p><p> </p><p>     I have the honor to inform you that the training of U.S. </p><p>Preclearance Officers to work under the Air Transport </p><p>Preclearance Agreement was completed by Canada Customs and </p><p>Revenue Agency staff on December 13, 2002.  Canada is now </p><p>prepared for the exchange of notes that will bring the </p><p>Agreement into force. </p><p> </p><p>    It is my understanding that your government is not yet in </p><p>a position to implement the Agreement, as the necessary </p><p>legislation to allow for full reciprocity did not pass during </p><p>the last Congressional session.  You and U.S. Customs </p><p>Commissioner Bonner have indicated that this issue is a </p><p>priority for you.  In light of the time and energy our </p><p>governments have invested in this file, I would urge you to </p><p>encourage your Administration to move quickly in order for </p><p>the exchange of notes to proceed. </p><p> </p><p>     Because of their involvement in this file, I have taken </p><p>the liberty of sending copies of my letter to the Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister and the Ministers of Transport and Citizenship </p><p>and Immigration. </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>William Graham </p><p> </p><p>End text of letter </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
