<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 004241 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KSCA, PREL, AORC, TBIO, TPHY, KSCA, PREL, AORC, TBIO, TPHY, VT, UNGA, VTUNGA </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN ON CLONING CONVENTION: DON\'T MAKE THE </p><p>IDEAL THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 160115 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: VATICAN DFM MIGLIORE TOLD DCM AUGUST 30 </p><p>THAT THE HOLY SEE SHARED U.S. GOALS ON THE CLONING CONVENTION </p><p>AND SUPPORTED USG EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A UN CONVENTION TO BAN </p><p>ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING.  HOWEVER, THE VATICAN FEARED THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04241  01 OF 02  030554Z </p><p>PRESSING TOO HARD FOR A COMPREHENSIVE BAN NOW MIGHT LEAD TO A </p><p>MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE A GLOBAL BAN ON HUMAN CLONING </p><p>THAT THE HOLY SEE REGARDS AS FUNDAMENTAL.  THE HOLY SEE IS </p><p>PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE U.S. IN THE LEAD UP TO THE UNGA IN </p><p>PURSUIT OF A TOTAL BAN, AND MIGLIORE TOOK ON BOARD THE NAMES </p><p>OF THE COUNTRIES WHICH REFTEL RECOMMENDS THEY APPROACH. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THE HOLY SEE IS PREPARED TO PURSUE AN </p><p>ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IF IT APPEARS THAT A COMPREHENSIVE BAN </p><p>IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE.  THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD DELETE THE </p><p>LANGUAGE IN THE CURRENT DRAFT UN RESOLUTION THAT LEAVES OPEN </p><p>OTHER HUMAN CLONING ACTIVITIES, WHILE RETAINING EXPLICIT </p><p>REFERENCES TO THE INTENT TO MOVE AFTER PHASE ONE </p><p>(REPRODUCTIVE CLONING) TO A PHASE TWO THAT WOULD BAN ALL </p><p>OTHER FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING.  THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THIS </p><p>WOULD ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE THAT ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING </p><p>ARE CURRENTLY REGARDED AS "UNACCEPTABLE."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  DCM PRESENTED REFTEL REQUEST TO VATICAN DFM </p><p>CELESTINO MIGLIORE ON AUGUST 30.  MIGLIORE INDICATED HE HAD </p><p>HEARD FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER MISSION IN NEW </p><p>YORK ABOUT THE U.S. APPROACH, AND CAUTIONED THAT THE U.S. </p><p>MIGHT BE TOO AMBITIOUS.  HE SAID THAT THE HOLY SEE FULLY </p><p>SUPPORTED US EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON HUMAN </p><p>CLONING BECAUSE WE SHARE THE SAME STRONG MORAL CONCERNS.  HE </p><p>FEARED, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD PROVE IMPOSSIBLE TO GENERATE </p><p>THE VOTES AT THIS TIME TO AUTHORIZE A CONVENTION ON A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON HUMAN CLONING.  IN THIS CASE, THE HOLY </p><p>SEE BELIEVED IT COULD PROVE IMPOSSIBLE TO REGAIN THE MOMENTUM </p><p>FOR SUCH A BAN IN THE FUTURE, AND THE MOMENT TO ACHIEVE A BAN </p><p>ON HUMAN CLONING COULD PASS.  MIGLIORE PREFERRED TO PRESS NOW </p><p>FOR THE PHASE ONE BAN AS PROPOSED BY THE FRENCH AND GERMANS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04241  01 OF 02  030554Z </p><p>BUT WITH CHANGED LANGUAGE IN THE AUTHORIZING RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) WHILE THE HOLY SEE AGREED THAT THE TWO PHASE </p><p>APPROACH CARRIED RISKS, THEY HAD DEVELOPED AN ALTERNATIVE TO </p><p>THE FRENCH AND GERMAN PROPOSAL THAT THEY BELIEVED COULD </p><p>ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE AGAINST ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING, </p><p>WHILE LOCKING IN A COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATIONS ON THE SECOND </p><p>STEP.  SPECIFICALLY, THE HOLY SEE WOULD PROPOSE DELETING OP </p><p>3(B), WHICH HE PARAPHRASED AS READING: "THE SOCIAL COMMITTEE </p><p>CLARIFIES THAT A BAN ON HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE CLONING IS NOT TO </p><p>PREJUDICE THE LEGALITY OR ILLEGALITY OF OTHER HUMAN CLONING </p><p>ACTIVITIES."  THIS DELETION, COMBINED WITH EXISTING LANGUAGE </p><p>FURTHER DOWN IN THE RESOLUTION EXPLICITLY CALLING FOR BOTH A </p><p>BAN ON REPRODUCTIVE CLONING AND A SUBSEQUENT CONVENTION </p><p>BANNING ALL OTHER FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING WOULD ESTABLISH THE </p><p>PRINCIPLE THAT ANY FORM OF HUMAN CLONING WAS "INADMISSIBLE" </p><p>WHILE OFFERING A WAY TO MOVE FORWARD NOW, MIGLIORE MAINTAINED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) DCM ASSURED MIGLIORE THAT THE USG APPRECIATED THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S DESIRE TO LOCK IN THE PRINCIPLE BANNING HUMAN </p><p>REPRODUCTIVE CLONING IN THE EVENT A COMPREHENSIVE BAN </p><p>APPEARED UNATTAINABLE.  HE REITERATED THAT AT THIS POINT, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE US BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BUILD CONSENSUS </p><p>FOR THE CONVENTION ON A COMPREHENSIVE BAN AND INTENDED TO </p><p>WORK HARD TO BUILD A COALITION TO THAT END.  DCM PRESSED </p><p>MIGLIORE TO JOIN US NOW IN PURSUIT OF A COMPREHENSIVE BAN, </p><p>WHILE KEEPING THEIR ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IN RESERVE FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING.

IN THIS </p><p>CASE, THE CAUTION REFLECTS NOT ONLY THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>PRAGMATISM, BUT ALSO THE EXTREME IMPORTANCE THE HOLY SEE </p><p>ATTACHES TO A BAN ON HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE CLONING AND DESIRE TO </p><p>ACHIEVE AGREEMENT ON SUCH A BAN.  WE ARE CONFIDENT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE WILL ENCOURAGE ITS UN OBSERVER IN NEW YORK AND NUNCIOS IN </p><p>POLAND, THE PHILIPPINES, HONDURAS, ZIMBABWE, AND IVORY COAST </p><p>TO APPROACH THE HOST GOVERNMENTS TO SEEK OUT SUPPORT FOR OUR </p><p>APPROACH TO THE ISSUE, AND MIGLIORE HAS AGREED TO UPDATE US </p><p>ON THEIR DISCUSSIONS.
