<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 000859 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, JO, PHUM. SOCI </p><p>SUBJECT: ONE IRAQI HOPES FOR WAR WHILE JORDANIANS PROTEST </p><p>AGAINST IT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  AMMAN 745 </p><p> </p><p>The following cable, which describes a recent encounter with </p><p>an Iraqi resident in Jordan, was drafted by an Embassy Amman </p><p>FSN. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  During the weekend of January 31, which </p><p>saw a large Jordanian anti-war protest (ref), political FSN </p><p>spoke at length with a middle aged Iraqi woman, who fumed </p><p>about the hypocrisy of her Arab brethren and hoped that war </p><p>would soon sweep away Saddam and the misery besetting her </p><p>people.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The Jordanian street\'s view of potential military </p><p>action in Iraq is unquestionably negative.  Many see it, </p><p>along with the war on terrorism, as part of a broader </p><p>campaign against Islam and the Muslim world.  Many even </p><p>accord Saddam Hussein "esteem" as the only Arab who stands </p><p>against "Western Hegemony".  Jordanians overwhelmingly </p><p>believe that war will be bad for the Iraqi (and Jordanian) </p><p>people, and want their Iraqi brethren to know they are "on </p><p>their side". </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>IRAQI IRONY:  THE FLIP SIDE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  On January 29, PolFSN spoke to a middle-aged </p><p>Iraqi woman resident in Jordan, who recently returned from a </p><p>17-day visit to Baghdad.  "The Iraqi people are waiting for </p><p>this war because they are sick of their lives, sick of </p><p>Saddam, and the injustice and fear they live with," she </p><p>said.  "He (Saddam) has brought us nothing but pain and we </p><p>want a change -- even if Sharon comes to rule us it would be </p><p>better than Saddam." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  "Iraqis are angry at the rest of the Arab world </p><p>for protesting the presumed war" and are especially </p><p>indignant toward the Palestinians.  They resent the fact </p><p>that Saddam gives so much money away to Palestinian martyr </p><p>families while leaving his own people starving.  "The young </p><p>have gray hair from the injustice and fear they live in, no </p><p>one can talk because every one man has two intelligence </p><p>(men) walking behind him." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  On day-to-day life in Baghdad, she said people </p><p>live very simply, with money for only the bare necessities. </p><p>The streets are empty, and people sit indoors to listen to </p><p>their radios, since everything on TV "is about Saddam." </p><p>Most are convinced war is imminent.  The Iraqi woman said </p><p>that the stores are relatively well stocked, but most Iraqis </p><p>can\'t afford to buy. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  She then described an assortment of </p><p>unpleasantness about Iraqi life, e.g. how her niece was </p><p>offered a scholarship and how Saddam\'s people "stole it" and </p><p>gave it to their own people, and how this kind of thing </p><p>happens all the time.  She talked about Saddam\'s tanks being </p><p>situated strategically in front of mosques.  She talked </p><p>about how lavish Saddam\'s palaces are, and how the rest of </p><p>the population struggles to put food on the table.  "Doesn\'t </p><p>the Arab world understand that we are sick of Saddam?  Even </p><p>if war is bad, people cannot go on as is... something has to </p><p>change." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) COMMENT.  Our FSN\'s contact is a former </p><p>schoolteacher in Baghdad and is now working as an in-home </p><p>manicurist in Amman to make ends meet.  We do not know what </p><p>percentage of Iraqis share her views, but her opinions were </p><p>strong enough to make an impression and merit reporting. </p><p>The sentiment she expressed was that while no one wants war, </p><p>many Iraqis see this potential war as their only way out of </p><p>an intolerable situation. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
