<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 000016 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOPORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPT POR NEA AND PRM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:DECL:12/31/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, IZ, JO, PREP </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAQIS IN JORDAN:  VIEWS FROM UNHCR </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Amman 6518 </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF) Summary and Comment:  According to UNHCR </p><p>officials, recognized refugees and asylum seekers represent </p><p>5,000 of the estimated 300,000 Iraqis resident in Jordan. </p><p>With just a ten percent refugee recognition rate, UNHCR </p><p>reports most Iraqis in Jordan are economic migrants who </p><p>simply are looking for a better life outside Iraq -- and </p><p>finding it in grey market jobs in Amman, Zarqa and Irbid. </p><p>This year, UNHCR has seen a decrease in the number of Iraqi </p><p>registered asylum seekers, from just over 5,000 in 2001 to </p><p>just under 4,000 in 2002.  UNHCR attributes the decline to </p><p>a slowdown in resettlement; toughened Jordanian border </p><p>policies; new Iraqi passport and exit visa policy; and a </p><p>recent economic upturn in Iraq.  UNHCR believes the fact </p><p>that so few Iraqis seek to regularize their status via </p><p>UNHCR registration means that most Iraqis have "other </p><p>means" to live quasi-legally in Jordan, maintaining their </p><p>status here by traveling frequently between Iraq and </p><p>Jordan.  In recent months, UNHCR has seen a "significant" </p><p>increase in the detention of recognized refugee and asylum </p><p>seekers and has heard anecdotal reports of tightened </p><p>two weeks.  ORCA sources separately confirmed that the GOJ </p><p>has been actively looking for Iraqi agents and has </p><p>increased deportations, focusing primarily on Iraqi males </p><p>of military age.  UNHCR\'s low recognition rate, coupled </p><p>with the current tightening of Iraqi border controls, </p><p>likely will keep the recognized refugee and asylum seeker </p><p>population small even as tensions rise inside Iraq.  Given </p><p>the economic focus of Iraqis resident in Jordan, coupled </p><p>with a high degree of caution regarding their future </p><p>prospects inside Iraq, UNHCR believes most Iraqis would </p><p>remain in Jordan for "at least several years" following </p><p>regime change, waiting to see the long-term effects.  End </p><p>summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) UNHCR officials report that at any </p><p>given time, roughly 1,000 to 1,200 Iraqis </p><p>resident in Jordan hold UNHCR refugee status, </p><p>with another 4,000 or so registered as asylum </p><p>seekers.  Although GID officials routinely cite </p><p>300,000 as the number of Iraqis resident in </p><p>Jordan, UNHCR officials told refcoord they have </p><p>no independent means of verifying this number </p><p>but also no reason to question its validity. </p><p>(GID officials recently told ORCA there </p><p>currently are 305,000 Iraqis in Jordan.)  UNHCR </p><p>Representative Sten Bronee told refcoord that </p><p>UNHCR has seen a decrease in the number of </p><p>Iraqi registered asylum seekers this year, down </p><p>from just over 5,000 in CY2001 to just under </p><p>4,000 in CY2002.  Bronee and other UNHCR </p><p>officials said several factors likely have </p><p>contributed to the decline:  a dramatic </p><p>slowdown in host country resettlement following </p><p>the September 11 terrorist attacks; toughened </p><p>Jordanian border policies; changes in Iraqi </p><p>passport and exit visa policy; and -- according </p><p>to status determination officer Soufiane </p><p>Adjmali -- a recent economic upturn in Iraq. </p><p>(Comment:  Iraq currently is replacing all </p><p>passports to the new "H" series, a slow and </p><p>cumbersome process that may well have reduced </p><p>the number of Iraqis able to travel.  At the </p><p>same time, however, Iraq has waived its </p><p>previous USD 2OO exit visa fee, a factor that </p><p>in theory should increase the number of Iraqis </p><p>traveling abroad.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) UNHCR officials believe that the majority of the </p><p>Iraqi population resident in Jordan is a fluid population </p><p>that moves easily between Iraq and Jordan -- primarily in </p><p>an effort to maintain legal status here.  Noting that </p><p>several thousand people cross the Iraqi-Jordanian border </p><p>every day, UNHCR Senior Protection Officer Jacqueline </p><p> </p><p>Parlevliet told refcoord that most Iraqis likely malntaln </p><p>their quasi-legal status in Jordan by returning to Iraq </p><p>every six months or so.  The fact that such a small </p><p>percentage of Iraqis resident in Jordan seek to regularize </p><p>their status via UNHCR registration (mere possession of a </p><p>UNHCR document identifying an Iraqi as a UNHCR asylum- </p><p>seeker generally gives Iraqis an additional six-month grace </p><p>period with the GOJ), Bronee said, indicates that most </p><p>Iraqis have "other means" to earn a living and maintain </p><p>quasi-legal status in Jordan.  (Comment:  It may also </p><p>indicate that the vast majority of Iraqis understand that </p><p>they do not meet UNHCR criteria for refugee status and </p><p>choose not to begin the process.)  Nevertheless, Caritas </p><p>separately reports that there are a number of truly needy </p><p>Iraqis among the non-refugee population -- primarily </p><p>elderly Iraqis left behind when other family members </p><p>migrated from the region. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) According to UNHCR community development officer </p><p>Lisa McCann, the majority of recognized Iraqi refugees and </p><p>asylum seekers live in the poorer neighborhoods of southern </p><p>and eastern Amman.  Smaller concentrations of Iraqi </p><p>refugees and asylum seekers live in Zarqa and Irbid, the </p><p>second and third largest cities in Jordan.  (Comment:  We </p><p>have heard separately that Iraqis seek housing and grey- </p><p>market jobs near the industrial parks of Amman, Zarqa and </p><p>Irbid.)  Only a handful of refugees and asylum seekers -- </p><p>those McCann classified as truly in fear for their lives -- </p><p>live scattered in rural villages.  McCann said that most </p><p>other Iraqis tend to live in Amman, with downtown\'s </p><p>Hashemite Square as their main gathering spot - the place </p><p>to see, be seen and find any long-lost friends or </p><p>relatives.  McCann added that for this reason, Hashemite </p><p>Square is also a known gathering spot for Iraqi </p><p>intelligence agents -- a fact that makes most refugees and </p><p>asylum seekers nervous.  Citing concern about Iraqi </p><p>refugees\' safety, Caritas recently decided to relocate its </p><p>US-funded Iraqi refugee assistance programs from Hashemite </p><p>Square to a more discreet and protected location in Jebel </p><p>Amman. </p><p>5.  (S/NF) UNHCR, like our consular section (ref), </p><p>continues to hear stories of tightened Jordanian border </p><p>controls.  Under previous Jordanian procedures, any Iraqi </p><p>citizen was granted permission upon entry to stay in Jordan </p><p>for two weeks, with an automatic extension to three months </p><p>and a possible, easily obtainable extension of another </p><p>three months.  Now, UNHCR and Caritas officials are hearing </p><p>anecdotal reports from the Iraqi community that Iraqis are </p><p>granted permission only for a two-week stay and that </p><p>certain categories -- young men under the age of 46 -- are </p><p>denied permission entirely.  UNHCR officials also have </p><p>heard that the GOJ is now actively deporting Iraqis who </p><p>overstay their two-week residency and is denying permission </p><p>to these Iraqis to re-enter Jordan.  Australian embassy </p><p>immigration official Todd Jacob separately told refcoord </p><p>that several Australian family reunification cases -- all </p><p>young single men -- were denied entry to Jordan by GOJ </p><p>border officials.  UNHCR officials told refcoord that they </p><p>have formally asked the GOJ to clarify its border </p><p>procedures, but that the GOJ has not yet responded.  (ORCA </p><p>sources report that under current GOJ procedures, Iraqis </p><p>are granted permission to stay in Jordan for two weeks only </p><p>and must immediately register with their local police </p><p>station upon entry into Jordan.  Separately, our consular </p><p>section has seen cases in which Iraqis who had been denied </p><p>entry by GOJ officials at the Iraqi border were later able </p><p>to enter Jordan through Syria.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NP) Parlevliet and UNHCR Representative Sten Bronee </p><p>confirmed to refcoord th </p><p>at there had been a "significant" </p><p>increase in the number of recognized Iraqi refugees and </p><p>asylum seekers detained by the GOJ in recent months. </p><p>According to Parlevliet, all of the recognized refugees and </p><p>asylum seekers had been detained on security grounds and </p><p>released without charge.  Parlevliet reported that the </p><p>detentions stopped abruptly at the beginning of December </p><p>presumably, she speculated, because the GID had discovered </p><p>that the recognized refugees and asylum seekers were </p><p>exactly what they appeared to be.  (ORCA sources separately </p><p>confirmed that the GOJ has been "actively" looking for </p><p>possible Iraqi agents and has increased deportations, </p><p>focusing primarily on Iraqi males of military age.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) McCann and Parlevliet added that most Iraqi asylum </p><p>seekers in Jordan appear to be economic migrants, without </p><p>any strong claim to refugee status.  As Parlevliet </p><p>regime opponents fled in the aftermath of the 1991 </p><p>uprising.  Although Parlevliet told refcoord that she at </p><p>first was appalled by UNHCR\'s low recognition rate in </p><p>Jordan, she now thinks the ten percent recognition rate may </p><p>even be too high. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) UNHCR officials believe the Iraqis resident in </p><p>Jordan would be slow to return home in the event of regime </p><p>change inside Iraq.  Stressing that most Iraqis in Jordan </p><p>came here seeking a better life, Parlevliet said she </p><p>suspects that they would take a cautious approach, waiting </p><p>to see the long-term effects of change in the region. </p><p>While most of the Iraqis resident in Jordan likely would </p><p>welcome regime change, Parlevliet said they likely would </p><p>adopt the same pragmatic approach to post-Saddam Iraq:  are </p><p>they economically better off in Jordan or Iraq?  Absent any </p><p>pressure from the GOJ to send Iraqis home, Parlevliet said </p><p>the Iraqi community is likely to remain in Jordan for "at </p><p>least several years" following regime change. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Comment:  UNHCR recognized refugees and asylum </p><p>seekers represent only a very small segment of the Iraqi </p><p>population resident in Jordan.  UNHCR\'s low recognition </p><p>rate, the GOJ\'s tightening of Iraqi border controls, and </p><p>the fact that the act of seeking asylum inherently raises </p><p>an Iraqi\'s profile likely will continue to keep this </p><p>population relatively small even as tensions rise inside </p><p>Iraq.  We will report via septel on the dynamics of the </p><p>larger Iraqi community resident in Jordan and its likely </p><p>role and impact here in the event of hostilities in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
