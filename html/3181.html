<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003346 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2007 </p><p>TAGS: KPKO, PREL, JO, KICC, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: ICC DEMARCHE TO TROOP CONTRIBUTORS:  JORDAN </p><p>SYMPATHETIC, BUT WILL HAVE TO STUDY U.S. DRAFT RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 119268 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)   PolCouns June 20 delivered ref demarche and the </p><p>text of the U.S. draft resolution on the International </p><p>Criminal Court (ICC) and peacekeeping operations (PKO) to Ali </p><p>al-Ayed, Personal Assistant to Foreign Minister Marwan </p><p>Muasher, and Samer Naber, MFA Legal Advisor.  PolCouns </p><p>emphasized USG concern about the potential ICC prosecution of </p><p>individuals engaged in PKOs, and noted that, absent adequate </p><p>protections, the USG will have to reconsider contributing to </p><p>PKOs.  The USG believes, he continued, that the best way to </p><p>address this problem is with a Chapter VII Security Council </p><p>resolution.  Jordan, as a significant contributor of troops </p><p>to UN PKOs, would not want to expose its forces to ICC </p><p>prosecutions without the GOJ\'s consent.  PolCouns asked for </p><p>GOJ cooperation on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ayed and Naber responded that Jordan is sympathetic </p><p>to the American position and, indeed, would not want any of </p><p>its peacekeeping troops prosecuted for actions taken as part </p><p>of a PKO.  Naber noted, however, that Jordan is the PKO </p><p>coordinator for the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and would not </p><p>likely be able to come up with a position on this issue </p><p>before consulting with other members of the NAM.  Ayed and </p><p>Naber promised to discuss the issue with FonMin Muasher. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
