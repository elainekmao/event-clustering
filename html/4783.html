<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 009051 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TU, POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: AK PARTY SEES DENKTAS AS OBSTACLE TO </p><p>CYPRUS SOLUTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8976 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Acting DCM Scot Marciel.  Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The political debate in Ankara regarding </p><p>Turkey\'s EU candidacy and the future of Cyprus is revealing </p><p>sharp differences between the ruling AK (Justice and </p><p>Development) Party/Government and the Establishmentarian </p><p>foreign policy class, including elements that predominate in </p><p>the MFA.  The fulcrum of the debate is "TRNC President" </p><p>Denktas.  Hailed by the Establishment as the one and only </p><p>representative of Turkish Cyprus, Denktas is seen by AK as a </p><p>major liability, complicating efforts to find a solution to </p><p>the decades-old Cyprus dispute and threatening Turkey\'s own </p><p>EU bid.  While the MFA continues to rally around Dentkas, AK </p><p>is subtly trying to undermine him.  AK officials support </p><p>Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot equities on the island, but </p><p>calculate that the voting public is nevertheless increasingly </p><p>weary of the stalemate and receptive to the notion that </p><p>Establishmentarian intransigence is counterproductive.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The outcome of the Dec. 12-13 EU summit Copenhagen is </p><p>regarded by Turks as a mixed blessing.  The EU admitted the </p><p>Republic of Cyprus as a member while giving Turkey a </p><p>conditional date of Dec. 2004 for the start of formal </p><p>accession talks (reftel).  While they accept that the summit </p><p>generated considerable progress in Turkish-EU relations </p><p>(though not as much as Turkey would have liked), the </p><p>cognoscenti recognize that the GOT\'s (and "TRNC President" </p><p>Denktas\') failure to ink a Cyprus deal in Copenhagen set back </p><p>the Turkish cause on the island and in Brussels.  This has </p><p>prompted the Turks to engage in the time-honored practice of </p><p>shifting blame; it also is providing an opportunity for Turks </p><p>to question some of the basic assumptions of the GOT\'s </p><p>traditional policy toward Cyprus.  The noteworthy aspect of </p><p>this reevaluation is that it is being generated primarily, </p><p>albeit carefully, by AK in conjunction with some newfound </p><p>provisional allies in the press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On Dec. 17, AK Leader Erdogan publicly noted that AK and </p><p>the "TRNC" share the same views on Cyprus, but emphasized </p><p>that there is "no overlap" at all between the AK position and </p><p>the Turkish State\'s traditionalist approach.  Foreign </p><p>Minister Yakis later observed publicly that if a solution is </p><p>not found on Cyprus, the Turkish military would be regarded </p><p>as "an occupying power" on EU territory. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Yakis\' statements prompted a rebuttal from Deniz Baykal, </p><p>leader of the opposition CHP (Republican People\'s Party) and </p><p>political standard-bearer of the Establishment.  Baykal </p><p>called for Yakis\' resignation, asserting that "of the six </p><p>billion people on Earth, the Turkish Foreign Minister should </p><p>be the last person to say such things.  I don\'t know how we </p><p>can correct the damage." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In a statement issued Dec. 18, the MFA supported ongoing </p><p>negotiations on the Cyprus disupte but decried the admission </p><p>of the Republic of Cyprus to the EU, charging that it was </p><p>unacceptable legally or politically.  A GOT "Foreign Policy </p><p>Summit" -- featuring Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, the TGS Chief, </p><p>President Sezer, P.M. Gul, FOMIN Yakis, MFA u/s Ziyal, and </p><p>Denktas -- endorsed the MFA statement and mutuality of views </p><p>between the GOT and the "TRNC." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Reaction among opinion makers reflects the divide. </p><p>The pro-CHP "Cumhuriyet" endorsed Baykal\'s call for Yakis\' </p><p>ouster and underscored the growing distance between AK and </p><p>"TRNC President Denktas  Others, including "Milliyet\'s" Sami </p><p>Kohen and "Radikal\'s" Ismet Berkan and Murat Yetkin, leaned </p><p>the other way.  Kohen described Denktas as an obstacle to a </p><p>Cyprus solution, and as a liability to Turkey.  "Hurriyet\'s" </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever on Dec. 18 also drew attention, for virtually </p><p>the first time, to the pecuniary interests in Cyprus among </p><p>Turkish Cyprus hard-liners, notably former foreign Ministers </p><p>Sukru Sina Gurel and Mumtaz Soysal, who is currently a close </p><p>Denktas confidant.  In the days before Copenhagen, Soysal, a </p><p>dyed in-the-wool secularist formerly with CHP, accused </p><p>Erdogan of being an "infidel" (gavur) for straying from the </p><p>Establishment position on Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>AK\'s View </p><p>--------- </p><p>4. (C) In private meetings with us, AK officials dispense </p><p>with diplomatic niceties regarding Denktas.  On Dec. 17, an </p><p>AK Parliamentary Group Deputy Chief described to us how </p><p>before AK came to power, the idea of publicly questioning </p><p>Denktas was akin to the third rail of Turkish politics.  "We </p><p>are the ones who opened the door to criticism of Denktas," </p><p>not only for his handling of the Cyprus problem per se, but </p><p>for helping to generate the economic morass on the island </p><p>that has perpetuated poverty among Turkish Cypriots and </p><p>Anatolian settlers in the north. On Dec. 18, Erdogan\'s former </p><p>Chef de Cabinet, now an M.P., and several associates asserted </p><p>to D/Polcouns that "Denktas is, and always has been, the </p><p>biggest obstacle in the way of a solution on Cyprus and has </p><p>to go."  Picking up on Ulsever\'s article, the AK officials </p><p>asserted that part of what perpetuates the status quo in </p><p>Cyprus, and in GOT Cyprus policy, is the personal financial </p><p>and other stakes Denktas and many influential mainland Turks </p><p>maintain in the "TRNC." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Comment: "Government" vs. "State" Policy </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Undercutting Denktas is a tricky business that runs </p><p>the risk of backfiring.  Over the decades, the "TRNC" leader </p><p>has built up relations with the Turkish Establishment that </p><p>have insulated him from public scrutiny here.  Moreover, </p><p>there appears to be little obvious daylight between the MFA </p><p>and the TGS on Cyprus-related issues.  Denktas and his allies </p><p>have also been able to play the nationalist card effectively </p><p>in Turkey, raising the specter of betrayal as a club to keep </p><p>critics in line.  As Soysal once noted to us, "Istanbul </p><p>capitalists might be willing to sell out on Cyprus, but </p><p>fortunately Turkish policy is made in Ankara."  He was not </p><p>referring to Erdogan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The rise of AK, and a broader popular consensus in </p><p>favor of EU accession, is beginning to shake some old </p><p>assumptions.  Reflecting the Soysal approach, the MFA took </p><p>the unusual step after the Nov. 3 elections that brought AK </p><p>to power of publicly suggesting that governments come and go, </p><p>while "State policy" -- on Cyprus and in other areas -- </p><p>endures and is not subject to change.  At a minimum, Turks </p><p>are now beginning to appreciate that there are major downside </p><p>costs for Turkey to the business-as-usual approach to Cyprus </p><p>issue. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
