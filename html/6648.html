TEGUCIGALPA 546 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry L. Palmer for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: After one year in office, Honduran President </p><p>Ricardo Maduro faces numerous challenges in one of the </p><p>poorest and most corrupt countries in the Western Hemisphere. </p><p> Maduro began his administration amid high expectations. </p><p>While he remains upbeat about his administration\'s ability to </p><p>increase security, reduce corruption, and deliver economic </p><p>growth, many factors, both external and internal, have </p><p>coalesced to make these tasks more difficult.  Maduro has </p><p>been unable to move his agenda forward and public support for </p><p>the Administration has likewise dwindled.  While Maduro often </p><p>says the right things, many are increasingly impatient with </p><p>his administration\'s lack of progress in key areas. </p><p>Moreover, with the economy growing very slowly, the </p><p>Administration\'s ambitious goals have yet to be fitted to the </p><p>state\'s financial straitjacket.  Maduro has made some </p><p>headway, particularly in the areas of governance, judicial </p><p>reform, and support for the international campaign against </p><p>terrorism, but he faces formidable challenges from entrenched </p><p>economic and political interests in moving his agenda </p><p>forward.  As he enters the second year of his single </p><p>four-year term in office, his administration needs concrete </p><p>results before presidential campaigning begins next year when </p><p>he will inevitably slide toward lame-duck status. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Status of the Maduro Government </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) President Maduro is facing increasing criticism from </p><p>both the political opposition, members of his own party in </p><p>Congress, and the public at large over his administration\'s </p><p>policies and his technocratic style of leadership.  Although </p><p>Maduro promised to modernize government processes, there has </p><p>been little movement towards decentralization and </p><p>depoliticalization.  Lack of planning and foresight continue </p><p>to plague the Administration, with Maduro reacting to events </p><p>rather than setting the agenda.  While many feel the </p><p>President\'s heart is in the right place, the political </p><p>fortitude, necessary personnel, and resources are not there </p><p>to move the Administration\'s agenda forward.  Maduro has </p><p>stated on several occasions that his personal popularity is </p><p>not important to him as long as he does the right thing for </p><p>the country.  Rhetoric like this has coincided with polls </p><p>showing that a year after taking office, less than 20 percent </p><p>believe the country is in better shape since Maduro took </p><p>office. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Many of Maduro\'s initiatives require congressional </p><p>approval but Maduro\'s National Party has only a plurality, </p><p>not a majority, within the unicameral body.  Relations with </p><p>Congress remain tense and Maduro\'s efforts to use his </p><p>bully-pulpit to advance legislation have met with limited </p><p>success.  He was, despite considerable opposition, able to </p><p>push through a direct energy purchase contract with the </p><p>American firm AES in January.  However, despite a solid </p><p>working relationship with his party\'s President of Congress, </p><p>Pepe Lobo, Maduro\'s biggest obstacle to enacting his </p><p>reformist program has been a recalcitrant wing of his own </p><p>Nationalist Party, known as the "dark side."  This wing of </p><p>the party is more interested in pursuing personal gain </p><p>through traditional political corruption rather than seeking </p><p>to advance a Nationalist party agenda or improve the overall </p><p>social and economic situation in Honduras for the betterment </p><p>of the Honduran People. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Since November, fresh rumors have been circulating </p><p>that Maduro would make some cabinet changes in an effort to </p><p>recapture the political momentum (ref A).  Many of Maduro\'s </p><p>ministers are not well known publicly and polling data </p><p>indicate that less than a third of those participating had </p><p>much confidence in the President\'s cabinet.  This issue was </p><p>raised publicly during a press interview in January when </p><p>Maduro was questioned on the subject.  At that time, he </p><p>stated he was in the process of evaluating his minister\'s </p><p>performances but had not made any decisions about possible </p><p>changes.  Although many expected movement in this area, to </p><p>date no changes have been made.  The ministers of education, </p><p>health, and social investment remain the main targets, </p><p>although Foreign Minister Perez-Cadalso may also be removed. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Bilateral Relations and Counterterrorism Cooperation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Relations between the U.S. and Honduras have been </p><p>excellent, but disappointing results, particularly in public </p><p>security, narcotics control, and the slow pace of judicial </p><p>reform, are beginning to create stress within the bilateral </p><p>relationship.  U.S. expectations were high when Maduro took </p><p>office that the new Administration would be able to tackle </p><p>some fundamental structural issues that were beyond the reach </p><p>of its predecessors.  Some progress has been made, but </p><p>considering the substantial U.S. investment in good </p><p>governance programs, law enforcement, and development </p><p>assistance, current results are insufficient to meet U.S. </p><p>expectations. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) President Maduro has been a good and reliable </p><p>partner of the U.S. on counterterrorism.  He recently issued </p><p>a statement on behalf of the GOH declaring that Honduras </p><p>supports the U.S. war on Iraq.  Also, The first major piece </p><p>of legislation passed under Maduro was a tough </p><p>money-laundering bill, and his government hosted a major U.S. </p><p>military counterterrorism exercise in March 2002.  The GOH </p><p>has quickly responded with freeze orders to all U.S. requests </p><p>regarding suspect terrorist bank accounts and to date no </p><p>terrorist assets have been found in Honduran financial </p><p>institutions.  Honduras was also the first country in Central </p><p>America (and the second in Latin America) to sign an ICC </p><p>Article 98 Agreement with the United States.  However, the </p><p>GOH has yet to submit the agreement to Congress for approval. </p><p> Other concrete steps the GOH still needs to take are: </p><p>designate a national coordinator for counterterrorism; file </p><p>its national report in accordance with United Nations </p><p>Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1373; and most of all, </p><p>sign and/or ratify the five outstanding international </p><p>conventions/protocols and two OAS conventions (1971 and 2002) </p><p>against terrorism.  It is also of vital importance for </p><p>Honduras to improve security at its maritime ports, </p><p>particularly Puerto Cortes.  Despite the right rhetoric, the </p><p>GOH has been slow to follow-through on necessary </p><p>counterterrorism actions. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Anticorruption Efforts </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Fighting Honduras\' endemic corruption was one of the </p><p>mainstays of Maduro\'s campaign to capture the presidency. </p><p>While the President\'s public resolve appears strong, it </p><p>remains to be seen if Maduro and his government, as well as </p><p>the judicial system and Congress, are prepared to press for </p><p>action against major economic and political figures involved </p><p>in, or with a history of, corrupt practices. Since Maduro </p><p>took office, there has not been one significant conviction, </p><p>or even arrest, on corruption charges. It is still taken for </p><p>granted that the rich and politically connected are above the </p><p>law, and it is still very difficult for the GOH to manage any </p><p>sizable government procurement efforts fairly and </p><p>transparently. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Maduro\'s administration has successfully implemented </p><p>some key reforms in the following areas:  the selection of an </p><p>independent Supreme Court; establishment of a task force to </p><p>capture white collar criminals, such as the fugitive bankers </p><p>involved in fraudulent banking practices; the first-ever </p><p>removal of congressional immunity from a deputy (in a rape </p><p>case); and adoption of the national budget by Congress in an </p><p>open and transparent process (ref B).  Yet many average </p><p>Hondurans still feel that no real change has taken place. </p><p>They are particularly looking for more concrete results </p><p>against individuals involved in corrupt activities, something </p><p>that has not happened to date. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In response to these criticisms Maduro has publicly </p><p>directed that his government take action against obvious </p><p>corruption.  However, he has also laid the blame for the poor </p><p>performance in prosecuting corruption cases on the Attorney </p><p>General (AG).  The AG is an independent appointee from the </p><p>Liberal Party with a seven-year term of office, which does </p><p>not expire until next year.  Maduro has expressed that the AG </p><p>is not in sync with the rest of his government team (ref B). </p><p>While very possibly true, lack of action by the AG\'s office </p><p>has thwarted USG interests in a number of areas.  However, a </p><p>possible move in the coming months by the Congress to remove </p><p>the AG before his term expires would set off a political </p><p>donnybrook and paralyze the nation\'s already weak </p><p>prosecutorial function. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Supreme Court and Judicial Reform </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Under Maduro\'s watch, the Supreme Court has been </p><p>developing into an independent branch of power, unlike any of </p><p>its predecessor courts since democracy was restored in 1982. </p><p>This has only been possible due to a new transparent </p><p>nominating procedures put in place to select the current </p><p>court and the imposition of seven-year term limits.  Supreme </p><p>Court President Vilma Morales is pro-reform in orientation </p><p>and has been effectively fighting to increase the Court\'s </p><p>status as a separate branch of power within the federal </p><p>government. The established political order is fighting that </p><p>prospect with all its might.  In fact, the Congress seized </p><p>the political opportunity to introduce legislation that would </p><p>amend the constitution to give itself the power to interpret </p><p>the constitutionality of any laws it passes.  Maduro works </p><p>closely with Morales to support her efforts.  However, he has </p><p>not risen forcefully to the Court\'s defense in public on this </p><p>issue (ref C). </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) While the establishment of the Court as a separate </p><p>branch of federal power is important, the Court continues to </p><p>be under substantial pressure from entrenched political </p><p>interests.  Of great concern has been the weight brought to </p><p>bear by the Nationalists in Congress over judicial </p><p>appointments.  Nominations have been sent forward for </p><p>unqualified and/or corrupt judges that Nationalist members of </p><p>Congress know would do their bidding.  If this process </p><p>continues, whatever political independence the Court has </p><p>established will be in jeopardy.  Moreover, the credibility </p><p>of the Maduro administration, which has touted judicial </p><p>reform as a major accomplishment, is on the line. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) A positive step forward was the introduction in </p><p>2002 of a new Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), replacing a </p><p>version that was still partially based upon Spanish colonial </p><p>law.  Under the old system, cases were resolved based on </p><p>written submissions rather than oral testimony.  The process </p><p>was slow, cumbersome, not transparent, and open to </p><p>corruption.  The new Code provides for oral trials, an </p><p>adversarial trial process, increased protections for </p><p>defendants, and overall changes intended to facilitate the </p><p>growth of a more transparent and effective system.  President </p><p>Maduro has been a strong supporter of judicial reform and </p><p>increased efficiency.  While passed under President Flores, </p><p>implementation of the CPC is something the Maduro </p><p>administration can point to as advancing this agenda (ref D). </p><p> Similar reforms are desperately needed on civil actions, </p><p>particularly in the commercial and labor sectors. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Public Security </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Public security remains a priority, if not the most </p><p>important, issue for the Maduro administration and the public </p><p>at large.  Upon taking office on January 27, 2002 President </p><p>Maduro\'s first act was to fulfill his main campaign promise </p><p>-- a zero tolerance campaign against the country\'s </p><p>out-of-control crime situation.  He deployed more than 5,000 </p><p>soldiers to the streets to support the police.  The public </p><p>responded enthusiastically.  However, despite the initial </p><p>success of establishing a visible police presence, violent </p><p>crime, particularly homicides and kidnappings, only fell </p><p>marginally. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) A year after taking office the campaign to reduce </p><p>violence appears to be faltering.   According to government </p><p>statistics the number of homicides increased in 2002 despite </p><p>the military\'s augmentation of the police force.  The </p><p>homicide closure rate in Honduras is only 1-2 percent.  Thus, </p><p>even if the police are successful in apprehending a suspect, </p><p>the odds of a conviction are small.  Public support is fading </p><p>and the campaign needs some visible victories to restore </p><p>confidence in the government\'s program.  The USG is helping </p><p>the Maduro government establish an anti-kidnapping unit, </p><p>increase intake/training of police recruits, create a model </p><p>tourist police force, boost its counternarcotics efforts, and </p><p>expand the frontier police.  The country\'s geographic </p><p>position makes it an obvious strategic transit point for </p><p>narcotics trafficking, alien smuggling operations and other </p><p>organized crime activities. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Despite this assistance, drug seizures have </p><p>continued to fall since Maduro took office.  Extrajudicial </p><p>killings, especially of children/young adults since 1998, </p><p>remain a source of serious concern.  The number of child </p><p>homicides continues to grow and there have been no aggressive </p><p>measures by the GOH to solve them.  Maduro\'s administration </p><p>blames increased gang activity, but allegations that rogue </p><p>police officials are responsible for some of the killings </p><p>have not been sufficiently addressed (ref E).  Maduro will </p><p>have to do better or the public will lose what confidence it </p><p>has left in the Administration\'s ability to combat the </p><p>scourge of violence.  The trafficking in persons of </p><p>women/children for prostitution in Central America, Mexico, </p><p>and the U.S. also continues. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) The unsolved murder cases of 30 American citizens </p><p>remains a thorny issue.  The GOH has established a special </p><p>task force, including a special prosecutor, and four </p><p>convictions have occurred within the last six months. This </p><p>represents significant progress.  While Maduro has addressed </p><p>these issues, the police have few resources to work with in </p><p>order to protect Americans and prevent crime.  For example, </p><p>six police officers on bicycles and one pick-up are </p><p>responsible for the entire island of Roatan outside the main </p><p>tourist areas.  Also of concern are the more than 150 land </p><p>and commercial dispute cases involving American citizens. </p><p>Though the GOH has worked to create a mechanism through which </p><p>some of the expropriation cases may be eligible for </p><p>arbitration, it remains unclear if the political will exists </p><p>to follow-though. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Border Relations </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) Honduras has border disputes with its three Central </p><p>American land neighbors and its seven maritime neighbors. </p><p>The disputes with El Salvador and Nicaragua are the most </p><p>heated.  Maduro is personally engaged with his presidential </p><p>counterparts to address these issues but there does not </p><p>appear to have been any concrete progress.  Foot-dragging by </p><p>El Salvador over the land border demarcated by the ICJ in </p><p>1992 has been particularly vexing.  Maduro has tried to move </p><p>the process forward with little success. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) On the Caribbean coast, Honduras and Nicaragua have </p><p>a long-standing maritime border dispute over the 15th </p><p>parallel.   Honduras provoked Nicaraguan retaliation when it </p><p>signed a maritime treaty with Colombia recognizing the 15th </p><p>parallel as its maritime border in 1999.  Nicaragua filed an </p><p>ICJ case over the maritime border and more importantly in </p><p>1999 slapped a punitive 35 percent tariff on Honduran goods </p><p>that remains in place despite a Central American Court of </p><p>Justice ruling that it is illegal.  With former Nicaraguan </p><p>President Arnoldo Aleman deposed as President of the National </p><p>Assembly, GOH officials were hopeful that Nicaraguan </p><p>President Enrique Bolanos would make good on private </p><p>assurances to lift the tariff, especially given the fact that </p><p>the Central American Court of Justice ruled in favor of the </p><p>GOH\'s petition against the tariff.  Frustrated by the lack of </p><p>progress on the issue, and under pressure from Congress to </p><p>react, Maduro recently announced plans for a retaliatory </p><p>tariff equal to that of Nicaragua plus increased fees for the </p><p>use of Puerto Cortes.  This measure will be popular in </p><p>Honduras and could boost the President\'s lagging popularity </p><p>while at the same time providing the GOH leverage against the </p><p>Nicaraguan tariff (ref F). </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Economic Problems </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) President Maduro inherited a stagnating economy and </p><p>seriously deteriorated government finances from the previous </p><p>government.  GDP rose by only two percent in 2002, which was </p><p>lower than economic growth rates in the previous years.  Per </p><p>capita income fell by 0.6 percent during the first year of </p><p>Maduro\'s administration while the Consumer Price Index rose </p><p>by eight percent.  Already one of the poorest countries in </p><p>the hemisphere, Honduras is falling further behind (ref G). </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) The GOH missed all key International Monetary Fund </p><p>(IMF) targets in 2001, and a limited effort in 2002 to enact </p><p>austerity and tax measures sill resulted in a government </p><p>budget deficit of 5.6 percent of GDP.  The GOH failed to </p><p>reach agreement with the IMF mission in November 2002 on </p><p>draft terms of a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth </p><p>Facility Program (PRGF) because of the GOH\'s limited efforts </p><p>to address the budget deficit.  On January 29, GOH\'s economic </p><p>team went to Washington to discuss with the IMF its planned </p><p>measures (elimination of tax exemptions and loopholes, </p><p>freezing of many government salaries, and a draft civil </p><p>service reform law).  The GOH believes it can reduce the </p><p>central government deficit to three percent in 2003 and take </p><p>measures to control the burgeoning wage bill, thereby paving </p><p>a way to an agreement with the IMF.  However, it has yet to </p><p>enact any of these difficult changes. </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU)  International Financial Institution (IFI) and </p><p>bilateral donor disbursements (USD 140 million) will be held </p><p>up until the new IMF program is in place.  There will also be </p><p>pressure for renewed GOH Paris Club debt service payments </p><p>(USD 100 million per year).  For example, Embassy has just </p><p>received instructions to deliver a demarche on potential </p><p>Brooke amendment sanctions if DOD loan payments are not </p><p>resumed.  In the meantime, the completion point for Highly </p><p>Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt reduction (worth USD 900 </p><p>million) continues to slip back further.  If unaddressed, the </p><p>country\'s fiscal situation and the lack of a new IMF program </p><p>could also impact Honduras\' eligibility for Millennium </p><p>Challenge Account grants. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>U.S. Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) Recognizing the benefits of increased trade and </p><p>economic integration between the U.S. and the Central </p><p>America, Maduro has promoted U.S.-CAFTA as the road to </p><p>economic growth.  However, the GOH was slow to prepare for </p><p>the negotiations and the negotiating team remains weak and </p><p>understaffed.  The GOH trade team has been leaning on the </p><p>more sophisticated Costa Rican team for advice and this </p><p>scenario seems likely to continue throughout the </p><p>negotiations.  The main objectives for the GOH in the </p><p>negotiations are to maintain the U.S. market access they </p><p>already have now, protect sensitive agricultural products, </p><p>and hopefully provide an improved investment climate in which </p><p>the vital textile sector can compete with Asia after the </p><p>elimination of quotas in 2005.  U.S.-CAFTA holds the </p><p>prospects of bringing much needed economic growth to Honduras </p><p>and the general attitude toward a free trade agreement is </p><p>positive.  Getting the agreement smoothly though Congress </p><p>though, where protectionist instincts run high, could be </p><p>problematic. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Storm Clouds Gathering? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) COMMENT:  The jury is still out on whether or not </p><p>Maduro will be successful in moving his agenda forward; the </p><p>challenges ahead are imposing.  The government\'s ability to </p><p>fund new programs is extremely limited and little prospect </p><p>exists to raise government revenues in the short-term.  While </p><p>Maduro remains optimistic, progress on his administration\'s </p><p>key goals are stalled:  no major convictions in the </p><p>government\'s crusade against corruption; crime (particularly </p><p>homicide rates) at historic levels, although there has been a </p><p>reduction in areas such as bank robberies, kidnappings, and </p><p>car thefts; and the economy is performing poorly.  The areas </p><p>where the Administration has made progress, such as reform of </p><p>the Supreme Court and the new CPC, will not bear political </p><p>fruit for some time. </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) In order to assuage his lagging popularity, Maduro </p><p>needs to show demonstrable progress soon on topics of major </p><p>concern to the voters.  If not, any mandate the president may </p><p>have had will be squandered and his desire to transform </p><p>Honduras thwarted.  President Maduro faces a very difficult </p><p>political challenge which requires his sustained engagement. </p><p>One major short-coming of his first year has been his </p><p>inconsistent engagement on critical issues and lack of </p><p>decisive leadership at crucial moments.  Just as the </p><p>underachieving talented student, he does respond and produce </p><p>the necessary effort to keep his government from failing. </p><p>But thus far, his efforts fall far short of receiving top </p><p>marks, despite his loquacious policy rhetoric. </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) Next month\'s possible visit to meet President Bush </p><p>will provide Maduro a much needed political lift, but will </p><p>also present the U.S. with an important opportunity to press </p><p>him for more concrete actions rather than just "nice words." </p><p>A strong exhortation from the highest levels of the U.S. </p><p>government could help him realize his administration\'s full </p><p>potential.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
