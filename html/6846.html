(U) AT APPROXIMATELY 06:20 THIS MORNING, AN IMPROVISED </p><p>EXPLOSIVE DEVICE (IED) WAS DISCOVERED IN MAHABANDOOLA PARK </p><p>WHICH FRONTS MERCHANT STREET ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE </p><p>CHANCERY.  THE DEVICE WAS DISCOVERED DURING A ROUTINE CHECK </p><p>BY HOST COUNTRY SECURITY SERVICES AND WAS DESCRIBED AS A </p><p>1/2-POUND BLOCK OF TNT WITH TWO AA-BATTERIES, A FUSE </p><p>DETONATOR, TIMER, AND A BLASTING CAP.  THE IED WAS DISCOVERED </p><p>INSIDE A PLASTIC SHOPPING BAG THAT WAS PLACED ON OPEN GROUND </p><p>(NO CONCEALMENT), INSIDE THE PARK, APPROXIMATELY 200 METERS </p><p>W-NW OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE CHANCERY.  THE IED WAS </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 5-METERS INSIDE THE PARK FENCE LINE THAT </p><p>PARALLELS SULE PAGODA ROAD.  HOST COUNTRY EOD SERVICES MOVED </p><p>THE IED FROM THE PARK TO A SAFE AREA TO DISARM THE DEVICE, </p><p>AND, INADVERTENTLY, DETONATED THE BLASTING CAP, SLIGHTLY </p><p>INJURING TWO OF THE EOD PERSONNEL.  THE TIMER ON THE DEVICE </p><p>WAS SET FOR 0830.  AS FAR AS WE KNOW, NO OTHER ITEMS, I.E. </p><p>PAMPHLETS OR LITERATURE, WERE FOUND WITH THE DEVICE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) POST BELIEVES THIS DEVICE WAS INTENDED TO CAUSE </p><p>DISRUPTION TO THE "NATIONAL ARMED FORCES DAY" CELEBRATION </p><p>WHICH IS SCHEDULED TODAY (27 MARCH).  WE HAVE NO REASON TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT IT WAS TARGETED AGAINST THE U.S. EMBASSY.  THE </p><p>LOCATION OF THE IED IS FAR REMOVED FROM BOTH THE PARADE ROUTE </p><p>AND CELEBRATION SITES, WHICH ARE CHECKED SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. </p><p> EVEN IF DETONATED, THE DEVICE WOULD ONLY CAUSE MINIMAL </p><p>DAMAGE, UNLESS, OF COURSE, A VISITOR HAPPENED TO BE IN CLOSE </p><p>PROXIMITY TO THE DEVICE WHEN DETONATION OCCURRED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) MAHABANDOOLA PARK IS CURRENTLY CLOSED.  SECURITY </p><p>SERVICES CONDUCTED A COMPLETE SWEEP OF THE PARK AND DID NOT </p><p>LOCATE ANY OTHER DEVICES.  LOCAL GUARDS HAVE CHECKED THE </p><p>ENTIRE PERIMETER AROUND THE CHANCERY--WITHIN THE PROTECTIVE </p><p>ZONE--AND DID NOT LOCATE ANY DEVICES.  RSO ORDERED MSG POST </p><p>ONE TO INITIATE AN EMERGENCY CELL CALL TO ALL AMERICAN STAFF </p><p>ALERTING THEM TO AVOID THE EMBASSY AND PARK AREA UNTIL </p><p>FURTHER NOTICE.  ALL EAC MEMBERS, INCLUDING THE CHARGE AND </p><p>DCM, HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE SITUATION.  RSO CONTACTED </p><p>DSOPCC AT 09:15 TO REPORT THE INCIDENT.  THE CONSULAR SECTION </p><p>HAS BEEN NOTIFIED AND A WARDEN MESSAGE WILL BE SENT TO THE </p><p>AMERICAN COMMUNITY LATER THIS DATE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) BARRING FURTHER INCIDENTS, POST IS PLANNING TO OPEN </p><p>FOR NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ON FRIDAY, 28 MARCH.  THE EAP </p><p>IS SCHEDULED TO CONVENE AT 09:00 ON FRIDAY TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>INCIDENT AND ASSESS POST SECURITY POSTURE. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
