(SBU) On April 1, 2003 Colombo Emergency Action </p><p>  Committee (EAC) met to discuss the local security situation. </p><p>  The DCM chaired the EAC. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) The EAC discussed the 2000-person protest on </p><p>  March 28 and agreed that despite the use of tear gas to </p><p>  disperse the crowd, the situation in Colombo remains fairly </p><p>  calm. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) The IBB representative reported a local from the </p><p>  area in which IBB is located briefly stirred things up by </p><p>  blaming the U.S. (and the police stationed at IBB) for his </p><p>  traffic fine.  He reportedly also made anti-U.S. comments. </p><p>  It appears, however, that the situation at IBB facility in </p><p>  Iranawila, Sri Lanka (which broadcasts into Iraq) is also </p><p>  calm. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) No members of the EAC reported significant </p><p>  problems with the police deployment at all residences.  The </p><p>  EAC decided to continue the request for assistance.  The LAV </p><p>  shuttle and the Ambassador\'s Police Special Task Force </p><p>  protective detail will also remain in force at least until </p><p>  the EAC reconvenes. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (SBU) A local newspaper quotes a representative of a </p><p>  local NGO as saying that arrangements are being made to send </p><p>  Sri Lankan youths to Iraq to support Iraqi forces.  RSO will </p><p>  bring this matter to the attention of local authorities and </p><p>  attempt to determine if this story is fabricated or true. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU) The EAC agreed to meet again on Friday April 4. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
