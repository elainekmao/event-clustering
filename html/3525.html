<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001879 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT AFRICAN AMERICANS UNDER FIRE; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "African Americans betraying Zimbabwe" </p><p>      the independent "Daily News" dedicated its August 19 </p><p>      editorial to criticizing a group of African Americans who </p><p>      are currently in the country at the invitation of the </p><p>      Zimbabwe government. The editorial accuses the group of </p><p>      being used as a propaganda tool by the Zimbabwean </p><p>      government as it attempts to demonstrate the "support of </p><p>      the international community" for its controversial fast- </p><p>      track land reform program.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .During (Mr. Robert Mugabe\'s) visit to the Far </p><p>      East in the first week of August Mugabe, to the </p><p>      utter disbelief of all diplomatic observers and the </p><p>      world Press who knows what the true position is, </p><p>      stunned everyone by claiming that his government was </p><p>      leaving all white commercial farmers with at least </p><p>      one farm each.  Last week he repeated that false </p><p>      claim when he told a group of `visiting\' black </p><p>      Americans that his controversial land reform </p><p>      program, a disguised, violent campaign launched to </p><p>      destroy the MDC (Movement of Democratic Change), </p><p>      would not leave white farmers landless. . .President </p><p>      Mugabe clearly believes that those claims will </p><p>      successfully fool everyone.  And that is extremely </p><p>      disconcerting, to say the least. . .And yet some </p><p>      obscure American blacks appear only too happy to </p><p>      support the lie - for the money of course.  It is a </p><p>      crying shame.  The world\'s moralists may not regard </p><p>      the late former President of the United States, John </p><p>      Fitzgerald Kennedy, as having been the best </p><p>      qualified to lecture the international community on </p><p>      matters of morality.  Nevertheless, his </p><p>      pronouncement: `The hottest places in hell are </p><p>      reserved for those who, in times of crisis, maintain </p><p>      their neutrality\' will stand forever as one of the </p><p>      best moral teachings of all time.  It\'s much worse </p><p>      for those who actively support injustice." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
