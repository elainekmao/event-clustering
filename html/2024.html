<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 005095 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), S FOR CRAIG KELLY </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 164/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 9/26/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, VT, terrorism </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS01: VATICAN POSITION ON RETALIATION AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (99) ROME 2196 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05095  281347Z </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM MERANTE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.Q(U) REFTEL OUTLINES THE VATICAN\'S JUST WAR DOCTRINE AND </p><p>ITS APPLICATION TO RECENT CONFLICTS. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) SEVERAL OPINIONS ON ITS APPLICATION TO THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES HAVE </p><p>EMERGED FROM SENIOR VATICAN CIRCLES IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. </p><p>PAPAL SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS MADE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>HEADLINES WHEN HE SEEMED TO DECLARE "AGGRESSIVE" MEANS AS </p><p>JUSTIFIABLE SELF-DEFENSE. NAVARRO-VALLS LATER ISSUED A </p><p>CLARIFICATION SAYING HE WAS MERELY STATING STANDARD VATICAN </p><p>DOCTRINE. WHILE POPE JOHN PAUL II CONTINUES TO CALL FOR </p><p>DIALOGUE AND PROMOTES PEACEFUL METHODS OF CONFLICT </p><p>RESOLUTION, SOME OF HIS SENIOR ADVISORS HAVE TAKEN A FIRMER </p><p>POSITION. ECUMENICAL DIALOGUE CHIEF CARDINAL WALTER KASPER </p><p>SAID SEPTEMBER 25 THAT "IT WAS NECESSARY TO BLOCK THE </p><p>TERRORISTS SO THEY CANNOT CONTINUE WITH THEIR CRIMES." </p><p>KASPER ADDED THAT INTERVENTION WAS "NECESSARY, OTHERWISE WE </p><p>ALL BECOME HOSTAGES."  NUMBER THREE IN THE VATICAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HIERARCHY, ARCHBISHOP LEONARDO SANDRI, DESCRIBED </p><p>TERRORISM AS A THREAT TO ALL PEOPLE, NOT JUST TO THE UNITED </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE BOUNDARIES OF THE VATICAN\'S JUST WAR THEORY ARE </p><p>SOMEWHAT BLURRED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE WAR ON </p><p>TERRORISM. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR A MILITARY RESPONSE VARY </p><p>FROM THEOLOGIAN TO THEOLOGIAN EVEN WITHIN THE VATICAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT. NO ONE IN THE VATICAN IS LIKELY TO PUBLICLY </p><p>CONDONE MILITARY ACTION. THE EMPHASIS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE </p><p>POPE, WILL ALWAYS BE ON PEACEFUL MEANS NO MATTER HOW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05095  281347Z </p><p>DESPERATE THE SITUATION. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE GRAVITY OF THE </p><p>ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, SOME LIMITED AND PRECISE </p><p>FORM OF MILITARY RESPONSE THAT ALSO SAFEGUARDS THE INNOCENT </p><p>WILL BE "UNDERSTOOD" BY THE VATICAN EVEN IF NOT OPENLY </p><p>SANCTIONED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) HOWEVER, UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR POSSIBLE U.S. </p><p>MILITARY ACTION IS NOT UNANIMOUS IN THE VATICAN AND WOULD </p><p>NOT BE.  EMBASSY HAS LEARNED THAT DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>(WHO IS NOTED FOR HIS PRO AMERICAN POSITIONS) HAS SAID </p><p>PRIVATELY THAT NAVARRO-VALLES WENT "TOO FAR" IN HIS </p><p>STATEMENTS.  YET, FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN IN PRIVATE </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH AMBASSADOR RECENTLY HAS IMPLIED A </p><p>RESIGNATION THAT HE BELIEVES THE U.S. WILL BE TAKING </p><p>MILITARY ACTION SOON.  ALTHOUGH MOST MEMBERS OF THE VATICAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY WOULD BE PERSONALLY SUPPORTIVE OF </p><p>AGGRESSIVE RETALIATION, OFFICIAL VATICAN POSITIONS WILL BE </p><p>BASED ON VATICAN GEO-POLITICAL CONCERNS.  IN THIS SPECIFIC </p><p>CONFLICT, IRAQ IS FOREMOST IN THEIR CALCULATIONS.  ANY </p><p>RETALIATION WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE IRAQ WOULD LESSEN THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S POSITIVE NEUTRALITY.  THE VATICAN IS FIRMLY </p><p>CONVINCED THAT ANY REGIME WHICH REPLACES THE CURRENT ONE </p><p>WILL NOT BE AS SUPPORTIVE OF THE LARGE IRAQI CATHOLIC </p><p>POPULATION.  IN ADDITION, EVEN IF POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTION </p><p>IS DIRECTED ONLY AGAINST AFGHANISTAN, THE VATICAN IS GREATLY </p><p>CONCERNED WITH A BACKLASH AGAINST CATHOLICS (AND OTHER </p><p>CHRISTIANS) LIVING IN EGYPT, SYRIA, IRAQ, PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRITORIES, AND LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: THE VATICAN\'S POSITION ON THE USE OF FORCE </p><p>IN RETALIATION WILL BE CRITICAL IN BUILDING WORLDWIDE PUBLIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05095  281347Z </p><p>SUPPORT.  POST REQUESTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT REMAIN SENSITIVE </p><p>TO THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THE VATICAN INFORMED IN ORDER </p><p>TO AVOID ANY SURPRISES AND THUS HARMFUL STATEMENTS ON THE </p><p>PART OF VATICAN OFFICIALS.  A PHONE CALL BY SECRETARY POWELL </p><p>TO VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN BEFORE THE UNDERTAKING OF </p><p>ANY MILITARY ACTION WOULD HELP IN FIRMING UP VATICAN </p><p>SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA05095 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
