<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001335 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, BU, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: BULGARIA SEEKING TO SUPPORT RECONSTRUCTION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbanic for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 6. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary. The Government of Bulgaria is seeking ways to </p><p>support efforts by the DoD Office of Reconstruction and </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance in the reconstruction and civil </p><p>administration of Iraq according to Bulgarian Ambassador to </p><p>Kuwait Angel Mantchev.  Mantchev met with ORHA Baghdad </p><p>Regional Coordinator Ambassador Barbara Bodine on April 8 to </p><p>inquire how Bulgaria could support ORHA,s mission. </p><p>Ambassador Bodine outlined ORHA,s work, stressing that </p><p>Bulgaria,s long history of political and commercial contacts </p><p>with Iraq could prove invaluable.  In response to Ambassador </p><p>Bodine,s questions, Mantchev said Bulgaria had particular </p><p>experience in highway construction and agriculture in Iraq; </p><p>could grant access to Embassy personnel recently evacuated </p><p>from Baghdad; and might be able to assign detailees to ORHA </p><p>to work as advisors in Iraqi ministries.  He added that the </p><p>Ministry of Economy has formed a working group to consider </p><p>other ways for the GOB to participate. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Mantchez opened the meeting noting that his government </p><p>had instructed him to make contact with ORHA to find out how </p><p>Bulgaria could support the reconstruction and civil </p><p>administration aspects of ORHA,s mission.  Ambassador agreed </p><p>that support for ORHA was an excellent opportunity for </p><p>Bulgaria to participate in the coalition.  She added that </p><p>Bulgaria, alongside other Eastern European countries, could </p><p>potentially make a unique contribution to the reconstruction </p><p>of Iraq since they had recently made the successful </p><p>transition from totalitarian to democratic systems. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Civil Administration.  Mantchev said the GOB was </p><p>especially interested in helping with civil administration in </p><p>Iraq.  He said that, as an initial step, the seven Embassy </p><p>personnel the GOB had evacuated from Baghdad to Sofia and </p><p>Damascus could meet with U.S. Embassy personnel to discuss </p><p>their experiences.  Ambassador Bodine said we would be </p><p>interested in learning about their work with Iraqi </p><p>ministries, especially their view of the prominent--and not </p><p>so prominent--people at each ministry that ORHA could turn to </p><p>in helping to get the ministries operating again, and any </p><p>information on how the ministries functioned.  (Action </p><p>request for Sofia and Damascus: would appreciate your </p><p>approaching the GOB and Bulgarian Embassy Damascus to arrange </p><p>to meet these former Embassy officers.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Reconstruction and Humanitarian Relief.  Mantchev said </p><p>that Bulgarian companies and subcontractors have significant </p><p>experience in Iraq dating back to the 1970,s and 80,s.  He </p><p>noted that the Nasariyah-Hillah highway had been built by a </p><p>Bulgarian firm and that agribusiness companies had also been </p><p>active there.  Bulgaria had also trained Iraqis in many </p><p>fields, Bulgarians who had married Iraqi students and were </p><p>now living in Iraq.  In the field of humanitarian relief, </p><p>Mantchev said that Bulgaria might be able to send bottled </p><p>water. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Liaison and Personnel.  Ambassador Bodine gently </p><p>dissuaded Mantchev when he offered to send Bulgarian liaison </p><p>personnel to ORHA.  Instead, she suggested that Bulgaria </p><p>should move, as soon as it was safe, to reopen its mission in </p><p>Baghdad as a Liaison Office.  The office could maintain </p><p>contacts with both ORHA and the Iraqi Interim Authority </p><p>(IAA).  If the GOB wished to contribute personnel to ORHA, </p><p>the best way would be to send them as detailees to serve as </p><p>sub-ministerial advisors; the GOB should consider sub-areas </p><p>at the division or bureau level within ministries in which it </p><p>had the personnel/expertise to contribute.  In addition, </p><p>Bulgaria could send an aid official to the </p><p></p></div>
