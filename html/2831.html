<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001323 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS POSTPONED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1159 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 1232 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 1029 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Andrews; Reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Demonstrating a degree of pragmatism in the </p><p>face of an incipient political emergency, President Obasanjo, </p><p>the 36 governors, speakers of the state houses of assembly, </p><p>leadership of the three registered political parties and INEC </p><p>agreed to hold local government elections on August 10 </p><p>instead of May 18, 2002.  It was agreed that state houses of </p><p>assembly would pass enabling laws to allow the naming of </p><p>caretaker local councils for the period between May 29 to </p><p>August 10.  This political solution allows INEC time to </p><p>update the 1998 voter rolls and register new political </p><p>parties.  While pragmatic, the decision to allow appointed </p><p>local government councils or the extension of present local </p><p>councils\' tenure is likely to be contested in court, and it </p><p>is uncertain whether it can withstand judicial scrutiny. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) President Obasanjo hosted a meeting at the Villa on </p><p>April 24 to seek a political solution in the wake of the </p><p>Supreme Court\'s March 28 decision invalidating the National </p><p>Assembly\'s attempt to extend local government officials\' </p><p>tenure to 2003 (Ref C).  After that decision, state governors </p><p>had set the local government elections for May 18, 2002. </p><p>However, it was clear the Independent National Electoral </p><p>Commission (INEC) could neither register new parties nor </p><p>update the 1998 voter rolls by that date.  May 18 elections </p><p>would have disenfranchised millions who had turned 18 since </p><p>1998. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The 36 governors, speakers of the state houses of </p><p>assembly, leadership of the three registered political </p><p>parties and INEC attended the April 24 meeting.  The day </p><p>before, the President had hosted the speakers discuss the </p><p>same issue, but that meeting was rolled over to the following </p><p>day after the Speakers\' Association dug in their heels, </p><p>demanding the local government polls hold on May 18. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) With the wider group of attendees at the meeting, </p><p>particularly the governors, the participants agreed to hold </p><p>local government elections nationwide on August 10, giving </p><p>INEC time to update voter rolls and register new parties. </p><p>Still, present local government officials must vacate their </p><p>posts by May 29.  According to Enugu State Governor Chimaroke </p><p>Nnamani, who spoke after the conclusion of the meeting, state </p><p>houses of assembly must now enact enabling legislation for </p><p>the appointment of the caretaker bodies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Kano State House of Assembly, viewing May 18 </p><p>elections as unrealistic (and apparently in anticipation of </p><p>the agreement at the Villa), had on April 23 passed a bill </p><p>authorizing the State government to appoint five-person </p><p>caretaker committees for each local government area for a </p><p>three month tenure.  The same week, the Kwara House of </p><p>Assembly extended until September 1 the tenure of the local </p><p>government councils in the state at the request of the </p><p>Governor.  (COMMENT:  The provision to empower states to </p><p>appoint caretaker local governments must have been an </p><p>attractive enticement for the governors and state speakers to </p><p>delay the elections to August.  Now the state officials can </p><p>appoint their followers in the local governments for that </p><p>important period immediately before elections.  This probably </p><p>buoys their hopes that they will be better placed than they </p><p>were before to dictate the outcome of the local elections. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) PolOff spoke April 25 with Dr. Musa Musa, a Bauchi </p><p>State Commissioner.  Musa confirmed press reporting of the </p><p>agreement.  Bauchi planned to abide by it; the State </p><p>Government had not considered itself able to hold the polls </p><p>in May anyway, he stated.  Musa opined that lawsuits against </p><p>the agreement were possible, as was the prospect that some </p><p>states might not abide by the pact (i.e., might seek to hold </p><p>elections on May 18 despite not having an updated voter </p><p>register). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On the face of it, aside from the present local </p><p>government councilors and the National Assembly (who had </p><p>hoped to reduce the electoral base of the governors), there </p><p>are few losers as a result of this agreement.  The state </p><p>houses of assembly stood in objection to the delay until the </p><p>agreement gave them the power to define the caretaker </p><p>councils.  The Governors will get their new local government </p><p>councilors long before they must run the gauntlet themselves. </p><p> The political actors who made this agreement hope to use </p><p>both the caretaker councils and the new local governments as </p><p>political machines to protect incumbents at the state level. </p><p>Given the close ties between political power and wealth in </p><p>Nigeria, and an absence of differing political ideologies, </p><p>"gentlemen,s agreements" that promote mutual protection for </p><p>incumbents are likely to be a recurring theme of the 2002-03 </p><p>election season. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Because the fulcrum of the agreement appears to be the </p><p>provision giving the states the easement to appoint </p><p>caretakers at the local level, the agreement could unravel if </p><p>that portion is successfully challenged in court.  While </p><p>current incumbents in the local government positions would </p><p>have an interest in making such a challenge, their term ends </p><p>May 29, and they do not appear to have a case.  However, the </p><p>federal constitution states that the people\'s right to </p><p>democratically elected local government is "guaranteed."  A </p><p>plausible argument could be made that appointment of </p><p>caretakers and even the extension of serving local </p><p>councilors\' tenure abrogates that constitutional assurance. </p><p>Therefore, while it is not clear who might make a legal </p><p>challenge or even which court would have jurisdiction, </p><p>someone will likely sue, and the agreement could unravel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Moreover, some state governments could choose to </p><p>abrogate the agreement and attempt polls on May 18.  Such an </p><p>act might be within the bounds of the constitution, but would </p><p>rekindle the controversy regarding registration of voters and </p><p>parties, which carries with it the specter of disorganized </p><p>elections and potential violence by those voters and </p><p>political partisans who feel disenfranchised. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Aside from the state governors and state assemblies, </p><p>the other winners from this agreement are the young potential </p><p>voters who would have been disenfranchised by a vote using </p><p>the old rolls.  The decision was also a victory for the new </p><p>political parties.  They could not have been registered in </p><p>time.  The threat of lawsuits from these quarters will likely </p><p>recede.  In the meantime, the primary burden has shifted to </p><p>INEC.  It must update voter registration, certify new </p><p>parties, and issue millions of voter ID cards, all within </p><p>less than four months.  This is technically feasible, but </p><p>INEC cannot tarry in its assignment, and the Federal </p><p>Government must provide the necessary resources.  If INEC can </p><p>do its job, and the courts do not scotch the deal, this </p><p>agreement will probably minimize chances for disorder and </p><p>enhance the quality of elections over what would have </p><p>occurred May 18.  However, if INEC falls asleep at the </p><p>switch, the deal would have served only to delay the </p><p>confusion and lawsuits. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
