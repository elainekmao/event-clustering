(C) THE GOZ SUBMITTED A LETTER FROM FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>MUDENGE TO THE EU IN HARARE AT 8:00 P.M. ON JANUARY 18, </p><p>JUST HOURS BEFORE EXPIRATION OF THE ONE-WEEK DEADLINE </p><p>IMPOSED BY THE EU DURING ITS JANUARY 11 ARTICLE 96 </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH A MUDENGE-LED GOZ DELEGATION.  THE </p><p>LETTER WAS NOT SIGNED BY MUDENGE, WHO WAS ABSENT FROM </p><p>ZIMBABWE WHEN THE LETTER WAS DELIVERED.  BRITISH HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER DONNELLY AND SWEDISH COUNSELOR FOUM </p><p>PROVIDED COPIES OF THE LETTER AND THEIR COMMENTS TO DCM </p><p>ON JANUARY 21.  THEY CHARACTERIZED THE LETTER AS </p><p>"RUBBISH" AND "GARBAGE", RESPECTIVELY, AND LISTED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING SHORTCOMINGS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON THE QUESTION OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE, THE </p><p>LETTER CITED RECENT PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY MUGABE, VARIOUS </p><p>MINISTERS, AND THE ZIMBABWEAN COMMISSIONER OF POLICE </p><p>CRITICAL OF VIOLENCE -- AND ALSO THE GOZ\'S AGREEMENT IN </p><p>BLANTYRE TO LAUNCH A PEACE CAMPAIGN -- AS EVIDENCE OF </p><p>THE GOZ\'S GOOD FAITH.  THE LETTER ALSO STATED THAT THE </p><p>GOZ "IS READY TO CONSIDER" A PROPOSAL TO SEEK AGREEMENT </p><p>(WITH THE OPPOSITION) ON AN ELECTORAL CODE OF CONDUCT. </p><p>ON ELECTIONS, THE LETTER CLAIMS THAT THE AMENDED </p><p>ELECTORAL LAW STRENGTHENS THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY </p><p>COMMISSION AND, THOUGH NOT STATED, PRESUMABLY OBVIATES </p><p>THE NEED FOR AN INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION.  THE </p><p>LETTER CONFIRMS THAT THE GOZ PLANS TO INVITE NATIONAL, </p><p>REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, THE LATTER DRAWN </p><p>FROM THE ACP/EU, SADC, OAU/AU, COMMONWEALTH, AND THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS.  THERE IS NO MENTION OF A START-UP DATE </p><p>OR WHEN FORMAL INVITATIONS WILL BE DELIVERED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00204  01 OF 04  221423Z </p><p>3.  (C) THE MUDENGE LETTER NEXT ADDRESSES FREEDOM OF THE </p><p>MEDIA, CLAIMING THAT THE EXISTENCE OF A "VIGOROUS AND </p><p>COMBATIVE" PRIVATE MEDIA ILLUSTRATES THE FREEDOM OF THE </p><p>PRESS.  IT ATTACKS TWO "PRO-MDC SHORT-WAVE RADIO STATION </p><p>...BEAMING INCITING, ANTI-ZIMBABWE PROPAGANDA...FROM THE </p><p>UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS" AND QUOTES THE </p><p>JANUARY 14 COMMUNIQUE FROM SADC LEADERS EXPRESSING </p><p>CONCERN OVER THIS ISSUE.  THIS SECTION OF THE LETTER </p><p>AFFIRMS THE GOZ PRACTICE OF LETTING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CORRESPONDENTS COVER NATIONAL EVENTS "ON THE BASIS OF </p><p>(GOZ) LAWS AND REGULATIONS."  THE LETTER REJECTS </p><p>ALLEGATIONS THAT THE GOZ HAS INTERFERED WITH THE </p><p>JUDICIARY AND CLAIMS THAT NO FURTHER ILLEGAL FARM </p><p>OCCUPATION HAS TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE CONCLUSION OF THE </p><p>ABUJA AGREEMENT ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2001.  THE DOCUMENT </p><p>CONCLUDES WITH A LENGTHY EXPRESSION OF GOZ CONCERN OVER </p><p>THE ARBITRARY AND UNILATERAL APPROACH THE EU HAS TAKEN, </p><p>AND CALLS FOR FURTHER DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) EU AMBASSADORS MET ON JANUARY 19 TO DRAFT A </p><p>COMMON RESPONSE TO MUDENGE\'S LETTER, TO BE CLEARED WITH </p><p>THEIR CAPITALS.  FOUM, WHO ATTENDED THIS MEETING, </p><p>OFFERED TO PASS US A COPY WHEN IT IS IN FINAL.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE DATE OF THE JANUARY 28 GENERAL AFFAIRS COUNCIL </p><p>COINCIDES WITH THE SIX-WEEK PERIOD IDENTIFIED BY THE EU </p><p>AS THE MINIMUM TIME NECESSARY FOR ELECTION OBSERVATION. </p><p>HE SAID THAT IF THE GOZ CONTINUES ITS FOOT-DRAGGING, HE </p><p>BELIEVES THAT THE GAC COULD CONSIDER TAKING ACTION ON </p><p>SOME STILL UNSPECIFIED SANCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT.  THERE IS STILL NO CONSENSUS ON WHAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00204  01 OF 04  221423Z </p><p>COMES NEXT AMONG EU DIPLOMATS HERE, ALTHOUGH THERE IS A </p><p>NEAR UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT THAT THE GOZ IS NOT ACTING IN </p><p>GOOD FAITH AND THAT GOZ RHETORIC HAS DONE LITTLE TO CURB </p><p>ONGOING VIOLENCE.  THE SAMPLING OF EU DIPLOMATS WITH </p><p>WHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN PREDICT THAT THE JANUARY 28 GAC MAY </p><p>WELL BE PIVOTAL, AND CONTINUED USG CONSULTATION WITH EU </p><p>STATES WILL BE IMPORTANT DURING THE INTERVENING PERIOD. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.
