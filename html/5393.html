<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000214 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: HARARE RESIDENTS CLASH WITH RIOT POLICE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 77 B) HARARE 42 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Riot police on January 29 clashed with several </p><p>hundred Harare residents gathered in the city center for a </p><p>meeting with Mayor of Harare Elias Mudzuri, who represents </p><p>the opposition MDC.  The meeting had been planned -- and </p><p>well-publicized -- more than a week in advance, and was to </p><p>discuss the variety of challenges facing the city, including </p><p>water shortages. The DATT and poloffs were prevented from </p><p>entering Town House by a senior police officer, who advised </p><p>them that the meeting had been cancelled and they should </p><p>summon their driver to collect them.  Others who arrived for </p><p>the same meeting were told the same thing.  A walk around the </p><p>block revealed a heavy deployment of approximately 75 riot </p><p>police -- many of them equipped with helmets, AK-47\'s, tear </p><p>gas canisters, and batons.   A crowd comprising hundreds of </p><p>mostly young men gathered outside the gate which encircled </p><p>Town House.  A confrontation soon ensued inside the gates </p><p>between an individual apparently angry that people were not </p><p>being admitted and the senior police officer.  The crowd </p><p>quickly became agitated at the police\'s manhandling of this </p><p>individual, jeering at the officers involved and throwing </p><p>bottles, stones, and bricks.  The police responded </p><p>immediately by firing tear gas into the crowd, which </p><p>dispersed quickly. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Mayor subsequently told us that police had </p><p>authorized him to hold the meeting so long as it occurred </p><p>inside, not on the front steps as planned.  The police, </p><p>however, cancelled it at the last minute, citing concerns </p><p>about the Mayor\'s safety.  After the situation calmed down, </p><p>police asked the Mayor to accompany them to the Harare </p><p>Central police station, but he declined to do so, instead </p><p>returning to his office.  As of 4:00 p.m. on January 29, </p><p>police were still milling around outside his office, and </p><p>Mudzuri was bracing himself for his second arrest in two </p><p>weeks (ref A), although it is unclear what the police would </p><p>charge him with. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment: MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai\'s special </p><p>advisor told us that the MDC had devised this meeting as a </p><p>legitimate reason to convene large numbers of disgruntled </p><p>residents in the city center.  The police clearly considered </p><p>it a provocation and demonstrated their determination to </p><p>quash any protests by deploying in large numbers and with </p><p>overwhelming force.  Although the turnout of residents was </p><p>impressive, the crowd\'s rapid dispersal at the first sign of </p><p>danger could not have been an encouraging sign for those in </p><p>the MDC advocating mass action as the principal means of </p><p>confronting the GOZ.  Mayor Mudzuri is beginning to gain </p><p>quite a following from those pleased with his in-your-face </p><p>stance toward the Government and its tactics of intimidation, </p><p>as more Zimbabweans -- including some in the MDC -- begin to </p><p>question the effectiveness of Morgan Tsvangirai\'s quieter </p><p>approach. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
