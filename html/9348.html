<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 003180 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR FOR SEC OF AGRICULTURE VENEMAN, STATE U/S </p><p>LARSON, AND USTR ZOELLICK </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR ZOELLICK </p><p>STATE PASS USDA FOR OSEC VENEMAN, FAS TERPSTRA, BLUM, </p><p>SIMMONS, EJONES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, ETRD, PREL, TBIO, IT, WTO </p><p>SUBJECT: BIOTECH: CORN CRISIS IN PIEMONTE COULD TEST PRIME </p><p>    MINISTER\'S RESOLVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: MILAN 452 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR MEL SEMBLER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.  AS WE\'VE NOTED </p><p>PREVIOUSLY, ITALY\'S COMPLICATED COALITION ARRANGEMENTS  MEAN </p><p>THAT PM BERLUSCONI IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN CURB </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO\'S DETERMINED EFFORTS TO CREATE </p><p>A BIOTECH-FREE ITALY.  UP TO THIS POINT, THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>HAS BEEN RHETORICALLY SUPPORTIVE OF BIOTECH BUT HAS DONE </p><p>LITTLE TO REIN IN ALEMANNO, AND WE HAVE LACKED A SPECIFIC </p><p>ACTION OR PROBLEM WE COULD USE TO TEST THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>RESOLVE.  WE NOW HAVE THE TEST CASE.  REGIONAL OFFICIALS\' </p><p>RECENT DECISION TO SEIZE AND POSSIBLY DESTROY CORNFIELDS </p><p>(REFTEL) HAVE GIVEN US A DISCRETE INCIDENT WE CAN USE TO TEST </p><p>PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI\'S AVOWED SUPPORT FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY. </p><p> COALITION TENSIONS WILL MAKE HIM RELUCTANT TO TACKLE THE </p><p>ISSUE, AS FORCING HIS AGMINISTER\'S HAND NOW WILL RISK </p><p>ALIENATING THE ALLEANZA NAZIONALE, THE PM\'S MOST STABLE </p><p>COALITION PARTNER.  BUT LEFT UNCHALLENGED, THE FIELD SEIZURES </p><p>(CONDUCTED BECAUSE OF THEIR ALLEGED CONTAMINATION BY BIOTECH </p><p>SEED) ULTIMATELY COULD JEOPARDIZE A $15 MILLION MARKET FOR </p><p>U.S. SEED EXPORTERS.  WE HAD HOPED THAT INTERVENTION BY </p><p>HEALTH MINISTER SIRCHIA WOULD PRECLUDE ADDITIONAL SEIZURES, </p><p>BUT TODAY\'S PRESS REPORTS FROM THE REGION INDICATE THAT </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL FIELDS MAY BE IMMINENT.  IT WILL </p><p>TAKE FIRM ACTION BY PM BERLUSCONI TO REIN IN HIS AGGRESSIVE </p><p>    AGRICULTURE MINISTER AND RESOLVE THIS MATTER </p><p>DEFINITIVELY--ACTION HE IS LIKELY TO TAKE ONLY IF HE KNOWS IT </p><p>IS IMPORTANT TO THE U.S. PRESIDENT HIMSELF.  THE CORN CRISIS </p><p>GIVES US A CONCRETE POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR A CONVERSATION </p><p>ABOUT BILATERAL BIOTECH ISSUES DURING BERLUSCONI\'S VISIT TO </p><p>CRAWFORD -- AND SOMETHING THAT WILL REQUIRE THE PM TO OFFER </p><p>MORE THAN JUST POSITIVE SENTIMENTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 3. (C) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST CONTINUED:  BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>UPCOMING VISIT TO CRAWFORD GIVES US THE PERFECT VENUE TO </p><p>PRESS OUR CASE.  THE PRIME MINISTER\'S TOP ADVISORS ALREADY </p><p>ANTICIPATE BIOTECH\'S INCLUSION ON THE AGENDA.  IF THE </p><p>PIEMONTE AUTHORITIES ARE APPLYING A ZERO TOLERANCE FOR THE </p><p>ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE OF BIOTECH EVENTS AS THE BASIS FOR </p><p>THESE FIELD SEIZURES UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF ALEMANNO, LEAVING </p><p>HIM UNCHALLENGED COULD COST US IN REAL ECONOMIC TERMS. </p><p>MOREOVER, ALEMANNO COULD WELL BE POSITIONING ITALY TO DRAW ON </p><p>THE NEW EU COEXISTENCE PROVISIONS TO EXEMPT ITSELF FROM EU </p><p>CONSENSUS WHEN THE ILLEGAL MORATORIUM FINALLY ENDS.   STRONG </p><p>ACTION NOW COULD SAVE US FROM A MAJOR BILATERAL PROBLEM DOWN </p><p>THE LINE.  THE PRESIDENT SHOULD ASK THE PRIME MINISTER TO </p><p>STOP THIS UNWARRANTED SEIZURE AND DESTRUCTION OF FIELDS, AND </p><p>TO TAKE ACTIVE MEASURES TO END THE EU MORATORIUM. END SUMMARY </p><p>AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  IN A JULY 10 MEETING WITH MINISTER OF HEALTH SIRCHIA, </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND AGMINCOUNS PRESSED SIRCHIA TO OVERTURN </p><p>PIEMONTE REGIONAL AUTHORITIES\' RECENT DECISION TO SEIZE, AND </p><p>POSSIBLY DESTROY, AN ADDITIONAL 980 ACRES OF CORNFIELDS </p><p>    BEYOND 25 ACRES ALREADY DESTROYED (SEE REFTEL).  REGIONAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES SEIZED THE FIELDS BECAUSE THEY ALLEGEDLY </p><p>CONTAINED CORN PLANTS ORIGINATING FROM BIOTECH SEED.  WHEN WE </p><p>FIRST RAISED THE MATTER WITH SIRCHIA ON JULY 4, HE OFFERED TO </p><p>PRESS THE RELEVANT PIEMONTE OFFICIALS TO OVERTURN THE </p><p>SEIZURES AND FOREGO ANY ADDITIONAL ONES.  SIRCHIA ALSO SAID </p><p>HE WOULD CONTACT PM BERLUSCONI, ALERT HIM TO THE PROBLEM AND </p><p>ENLIST HIS SUPPORT IN FORCING THE AGRICULTURE MINISTRY TO </p><p>STOP ENCOURAGING THESE TYPES OF REGIONAL \'ENFORCEMENT\' </p><p>ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IN HIS RESPONSE, SIRCHIA SAID HE HAD DIRECTED REGIONAL </p><p>HEALTH AUTHORITIES IN PIEMONTE TO DESIST FROM DESTROYING THE </p><p>FIELDS SEIZED OR FROM SEIZING ADDITIONAL FIELDS IF TESTING </p><p>REVEALED THE ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE OF BIOTECH PLANTS.  HE </p><p>ALSO SAID HE WAS CONVOKING THE RELEVANT OFFICIALS TO ROME FOR </p><p>A JULY 24 MOH BIOTECH REVIEW COMMITTEE MEETING TO DETERMINE </p><p>WHAT, IF ANY, ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WOULD BE TAKEN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  IN CONTRAST TO SIRCHIA\'S ENCOURAGING COMMENTS </p><p>YESTERDAY, THREE MAJOR ITALIAN DAILIES REPORTED THIS MORNING </p><p>THAT THE REGIONAL AUTHORITIES (I.E., PIEMONTE GOVERNOR, ENZO </p><p>GHIGO) ARE PREPARED TO DESTROY THE FIELDS IMMEDIATELY. </p><p>CONTACT WITH THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH THIS MORNING REVEALED </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00003180  002 OF 002 </p><p> </p><p>LVEMENT OF THE LOCAL </p><p>MAGISTRATE\'S OFFICE IN THE ORDER TO SEIZE AND DESTROY THE </p><p>FIELDS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) SIRCHIA ALSO PROVIDED THE AMBASSADOR A COPY OF HIS </p><p>JULY 8 LETTER TO BERLUSCONI (TEXT PARA 9), IN WHICH HE WARNED </p><p>BERLUSCONI THAT THE SEIZURES AND OTHER ACTIONS BY AG MINISTER </p><p>ALEMANNO RISKED LEADING ITALY INTO A TRADE DISPUTE WITH THE </p><p>U.S. THAT WOULD SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE ITALIAN COMMERCIAL </p><p>INTERESTS.  SIRCHIA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>PERSONAL INTERVENTION WOULD BE NECESSARY TO RESTRAIN ALEMANNO </p><p>FROM IMPLEMENTING THE EXTREME (EVEN BY EU STANDARDS) </p><p>ANTI-BIOTECH VISION THE AGMINISTER HAS ADVOCATED CONSISTENTLY </p><p>WITH GROWING POLITICAL SKILL. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) AMBASSADOR REMINDED SIRCHIA ON JULY 9 THAT ITALY </p><p>IMPORTS 4 MILLION TONS OF SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL, THE BULK </p><p>OF WHICH IS GENETICALLY-MODIFIED.  ALEMANNO\'S RHETORIC ABOUT </p><p>KEEPING ITALY FREE FROM GMO PRODUCTS WAS NOT ONLY FACTUALLY </p><p>INCORRECT, BUT BLATANTLY PROTECTIONIST AND DECEIVES ITALIAN </p><p>CONSUMERS.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THERE WAS STRONG </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL INTEREST IN BIOTECH ISSUES; WE COULD NOT RULE </p><p>OUT CONGRESS MOVING AHEAD TO IMPOSE COUNTER-MEASURES IF THE </p><p>CURRENT TREATMENT OF U.S. PRODUCTS CONTINUED. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) BEGIN INFORMAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF SIRCHIA LETTER </p><p>TO BERLUSCONI: </p><p></p><p>ROME, JULY 8, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>DEAR SILVIO, </p><p> </p><p>I AM WRITING YOU TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE MATTER </p><p>RELATING TO GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, WITH SPECIAL </p><p>REFERENCE TO THE SEEDS SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>PRESENTLY, NO LAW HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO SET A MAXIMUM </p><p>TOLERANCE LEVEL FOR THE POSSIBLE ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE OF </p><p>GMOS IN SEEDS USED FOR CORN AND SOYBEAN CROPS. </p><p> </p><p>THE ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE OF GMOS IS TO BE ASCRIBED TO THE </p><p>ACCIDENTAL COMBINATION OF CROPS CONTAINING GENETICALLY </p><p>MODIFIED ORGANISMS LEGALLY AUTHORIZED IN THE EUROPE AND THE </p><p>UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>IN SPITE OF THE ABOVE, SOME REGIONS AND THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE ITSELF, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SEEDS SECTOR, SHOW NO </p><p>TOLERANCE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGIES AND GMOS WITH CONSEQUENT </p><p>NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE AGRO-FOOD SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>PENDING THE EUROPEAN REGULATIONS ON LABELING AND </p><p>TRACEABILITY, AN ATTITUDE OF THIS KIND IS ONLY CREATING </p><p>PROBLEMS IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES OF </p><p>AMERICA.  TOMORROW, THE AMBASSADOR OF THE UNITED STATES OF </p><p>AMERICA, MEL SEMBLER, AND THE MINISTER-COUNSELOR FOR </p><p>AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS, LISA HARDY-BASS, WILL BE MEETING WITH </p><p>ME TO DELIVER A FORMAL PROTEST ON BEHALF OF THE U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AS WAS ANTICIPATED BY SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND </p><p>    HUMAN SERVICES TOMMY THOMPSON LAST JUNE IN WASHINGTON.  THEIR </p><p>REQUEST IS FOR YOUR ACTION, NOT SO MUCH MINE, TO AVOID </p><p>UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD HIGHLY COMPROMISE OUR </p><p>TRADE RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING RETALIATION </p><p>FOR SOME PRODUCTS. </p><p> </p><p>I AM WELL AWARE OF HOW DIFFICULT THIS PROBLEM IS, BUT I AM </p><p>CONVINCED THAT YOUR INTERVENTION MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE </p><p>SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>(COMPLIMENTARY CLOSING) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03180 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
