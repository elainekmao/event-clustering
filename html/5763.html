<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000990 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND PRM; PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p>SAN JOSE FOR USAID/OFDA GUY LAWSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, EAID, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: CARE IRAQ PROGRAM DIRECTOR:  MAINTENANCE OF FOOD </p><p>RATIONS AND ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE KEY; LARGE POPULATION </p><p>MOVEMENTS UNLIKELY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  According to CARE Iraq Country Director </p><p>Margaret Hassan (protect), the Iraqi population is "entirely </p><p>dependent" on the OFF food ration system and has no economic </p><p>resources to draw upon if the OFF pipeline is interrupted. </p><p>Hassan also cautioned that Iraq\'s water/sanitation system and </p><p>hence public health standards are entirely dependent on </p><p>electricity.  Hassan advised that Iraq has a well-trained </p><p>population that is fully capable of running a sophisticated </p><p>infrastructure and humanitarian services network; NGOs </p><p>seeking to provide services inside Iraq should play a </p><p>supporting rather than supplanting role.  Hassan expects that </p><p>very few Iraqis or TCNs would seek to leave Iraq in the event </p><p>of a crisis, as Iraqis would either stay at home or seek </p><p>refuge outside urban areas and most TCNs are well-integrated </p><p>in Iraqi society and no more likely to flee than any other </p><p>group.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CARE Iraq Country Director Margaret Hassan, a dual </p><p>British-Iraqi national who has lived in Iraq for the last </p><p>twenty years (please protect source) briefed PRM and </p><p>USAID/OFDA officers and regional refcoord February 3 on </p><p>current humanitarian conditions inside Iraq.  Hassan was in </p><p>Amman en route between meetings in New York and Beirut, and </p><p>was accompanied by CARE regional emergency coordinator Graham </p><p>Miller.  With sixty employees, CARE is the largest </p><p>international NGO working in central/southern Iraq.  The Iraq </p><p>program is run by CARE UK. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Iraqi Population Impoverished, Dependent on OFF Rations </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Hassan reported that, after 12 years of sanctions, </p><p>the population of Iraq is "entirely dependent" on the UN\'s </p><p>food ration system.  Any military action that would disrupt </p><p>the food ration system would be a "complete disaster" as </p><p>Iraqi citizens have no economic resources to fall back on in </p><p>a crisis.  To illustrate her point, Hassan recounted a recent </p><p>visit to the home of an Iraqi schoolteacher in Basra.  The </p><p>teacher, who earns roughly seven U.S. dollars per month, had </p><p>sold all of his belongings in order to augment his income. </p><p>Hassan said the teacher had nothing -- not even a chair to </p><p>offer his guest -- in his home.  When Hassan asked the </p><p>teacher how he and his family would cope if his food rations </p><p>were disrupted, he said the family would have no choice but </p><p>to go hungry.  Hassan added that although the Iraqi </p><p>government was now distributing two and sometimes even three </p><p>months\' of food rations in advance, the poorest Iraqis often </p><p>sell those rations in order to buy basic household </p><p>commodities. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In addition, Hassan reported that the food ration </p><p>system has distorted Iraq\'s natural economy.  Because the </p><p>government-run OFF system brings into Iraq certain imported </p><p>foods, local Iraqi merchants no longer are purchasing their </p><p>own stocks of rice and flour.  Hassan therefore fears that if </p><p>the OFF pipeline is disrupted, even Iraqis with money would </p><p>not be able access certain types of food. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Sophisticated Infrastructure Dependent on Electricity </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Hassan emphasized that Iraq is an urban society, </p><p>entirely dependent on electricity for its wat/san and health </p><p>sectors.  If Iraq\'s electrical system is disrupted, it will </p><p>not be able to maintain its extensive water purification </p><p>systems.  CARE\'s programs in Iraq have focused largely on </p><p>improving public health by improving water quality; it works </p><p>in "all" of Iraq\'s water treatment plants and hospitals. </p><p>(NOTE:  Refcoord passed humanitarian mapping instructions to </p><p>Hassan; we do not know whether CARE has submitted any </p><p>information on its Iraq programs or installations.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Hassan also emphasized that Iraq has a large, </p><p>well-organized and well-trained network of skilled </p><p>professionals who are able to run the country\'s existing </p><p>infrastructure in all sectors but especially in health and </p><p>water and sanitation.  Any NGOs seeking to provide services </p><p>in post-conflict Iraq should be prepared to play a </p><p>supporting, rather than supplanting role in these areas. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Large Population Displacements Unlikely </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Hassan expects that few Iraqis would seek refuge </p><p>outside Iraq in the event of hostilities.  Noting that the </p><p>Iraqi population has endured difficult conditions since the </p><p>1990-91 Gulf War, she predicted that most Iraqis will either </p><p>hunker down in their homes or seek refuge with friends or </p><p>families outside urban centers.  Hassan also predicted that </p><p>many of the one million Iraqis already internally displaced </p><p>(some from the Iran-Iraq war, others from 1991) would remain </p><p>in their current locations in the event of hostilities.  Most </p><p>of these "displaced" Iraqis, Hassan said, are now permanently </p><p>relocated and have no intention of returning to their </p><p>previous residences. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Hassan also expects that very few Egyptians or </p><p>Palestinians resident in Iraq would try to leave Iraq in the </p><p>event of hostilities.  Although there were three million </p><p>Egyptian laborers resident in Iraq before the 1990-91 crisis, </p><p>Hassan believes that there are now less than 100,000 </p><p>Egyptians resident in Iraq.  Of that population, most are </p><p>very integrated into Iraqi society and unlikely to flee. </p><p>Similarly, Hassan characterized the Palestinian population in </p><p>Iraq as "very well integrated" and no more likely to flee </p><p>Iraq than any other group.  She cautioned, however, that </p><p>Palestinians resident in Iraq do not hold Iraqi citizenship </p><p>and would most likely show up at borders without any </p><p>documentation if they fled Iraq. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
