(S) Summary:  During the January 3 military-military </p><p>talks, the Turkish General Staff provided a map identifying </p><p>planned locations for Turkish-run IDP camps to EUCOM and </p><p>CENTCOM representatives.  MFA Head of Department for </p><p>International Political Organizations Feza Ozturk largely </p><p>confirmed previously-disclosed information on GOT contingency </p><p>planning for a refugee/IDP crisis, including provision for up </p><p>to 276,000 persons and siting of some camps in northern Iraq. </p><p> He noted that Turkey was short of tents in relation to its </p><p>plans.  Ozturk and other interlocutors were very cautious </p><p>about NGO involvement in humanitarian assistance, but the GOT </p><p>is still considering whether and how to involve them in its </p><p>planning.  Prime Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Mustafa Cetin </p><p>told DCM that the GOT had done considerable planning, but did </p><p>not go into detail.  He did express willingness to work with </p><p>foreign humanitarian NGOs, and urged Embassy to discuss this </p><p>further with MFA.  Turkish Red Crescent\'s Director General </p><p>told us that the organization did not have sufficient </p><p>supplies to cover all needs in the contingency plan and said </p><p>he would provide details later.  He also expressed concern </p><p>about conducting relief operations in an environment in which </p><p>CBW could be used.  Econoff also raised ref A request with </p><p>Steven Corliss, UNHCR\'s Deputy Turkey Representative, who </p><p>said he would pass this on to UNSECOORD.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Emboffs discussed refugee/internally displaced person </p><p>(IDP) contingency planning connected with possible military </p><p>operations in Iraq as well as ref A\'s request for </p><p>humanitarian mapping information in separate meetings with </p><p>Feza Ozturk, MFA Department Head for International Political </p><p>Organizations; Mustafa Cetin, Deputy Undersecretary in the </p><p>Prime Ministry; Fatih Evren, General Director of the Turkish </p><p>Red Crescent; and Steven Corliss, Deputy Turkey </p><p>Representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mapping Information Shared at Mil-Mil Talks </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) During the January 3 military-military talks in </p><p>Ankara, the Turkish General Staff provided a map to EUCOM and </p><p>CENTCOM representatives identifying the locations of planned </p><p>IDP camps in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Contingency Planning:  Econoff and Polmiloff met with </p><p>Feza Ozturk, MFA Department Head for International Political </p><p>Organizations, on January 7 to discuss Turkey\'s contingency </p><p>planning for a refugee/IDP crisis and to relay ref A request </p><p>on humanitarian mapping.  Ozturk largely confirmed and </p><p>fleshed out details of planning previously given by UNHCR and </p><p>also leaked to the local press (ref B).  The GOT has the </p><p>capacity to deal with 276,000 refugees/IDPs, but Ozturk </p><p>stressed that this was not necessarily the number expected at </p><p>Turkey\'s frontiers in the event of military operations.  He </p><p>said the number would depend on a number of unknown </p><p>variables, including whether there would be a northern front. </p><p> The plan calls for up to 18 camps (12 in northern Iraq and 6 </p><p>on Turkish territory).  The camps and supplies are modular </p><p>and can be launched and augmented in increments of 3,000 </p><p>persons.  The Turkish military would be responsible only for </p><p>external camp security, with six Turkish regional governors </p><p>from southeast Turkey and the Turkish Red Crescent </p><p>responsible for internal administration.  Turkey would set up </p><p>camps inside Iraq first and only open the six camps in Turkey </p><p>if needed.  All camps in Iraq would be within an hour\'s drive </p><p>of the Turkish border.  Ozturk said the facilities could be </p><p>erected within several days or at most one week.  Ozturk said </p><p>that the Red Crescent had pre-positioned some of its 30,000 </p><p>to 35,000 stock of tents and other supplies in Silopi, but </p><p>that these stocks were insufficient relative to the plan.  He </p><p>said that, in the event that the full 276,000 refugees/IDPs </p><p>required help, Turkey would have to ask for tents to shelter </p><p>up to 120,000 persons.  Crisis centers would be established </p><p>at the Prime Ministry and MFA.  A regional crisis center </p><p>would be established in Diyarbakir, with several Turkish </p><p>diplomats posted there.  Gaziantep would serve as the </p><p>logistical hub. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ozturk stated that Turkey\'s contingency plans had been </p><p>shared in part with UNHCR, but not with foreign </p><p>governments/donors and he requested that we protect this </p><p>information.  He noted that UNHCR had made a quiet appeal to </p><p>donors for supplemental funding, but that Turkey did not plan </p><p>to make a similar appeal at this point.  Of course, if the </p><p>Red Crescent exhausted its resources, Turkey would approach </p><p>donors to replenish its stocks.  We asked if the GOT had </p><p>shared its plans with the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), </p><p>which controls the territory in northern Iraq where Turkey </p><p>intends to set up the camps.  Ozturk responded that the GOT </p><p>had not. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) On the Geneva Convention:  Ozturk pointed out that </p><p>although Turkey is a party to the Geneva Convention on </p><p>Refugees, it has made a geographical reservation accepting </p><p>the treaty\'s obligations only with respect to refugees from </p><p>the European continent and does not accept refugees from its </p><p>eastern neighbors for resettlement in Turkey.  He </p><p>acknowledged that Turkey would in the future have to amend </p><p>this policy as a condition of EU membership. </p><p>7. (C) Role of NGOs:  Polmiloff noted that NGOs were an </p><p>integral part of USG humanitarian relief planning, both for </p><p>Iraq and elsewhere, and asked Ozturk what the GOT\'s views </p><p>were on a role for NGOs in this possible crisis.  Ozturk said </p><p>the GOT was very cautious about certain (unspecified) NGOs, </p><p>contending that some had pursued a political as well as </p><p>humanitarian agenda following the Gulf War and had supported </p><p>the PKK.  He noted the GOT\'s standing decision to ban border </p><p>crossings into northern Iraq of NGO personnel in 1996 (though </p><p>some exceptions were granted later).  Note:  During the </p><p>January 3 military-military talks, TGS said that it was GOT </p><p>policy not to allow NGOs to enter Iraq via Turkey during the </p><p>combat phases of an operation.  End Note.  He cited the </p><p>absence of an official border authority on the Iraqi side as </p><p>another reason for the prohibition, saying Turkey would </p><p>remain responsible for the activities of NGO representatives </p><p>after they crossed into Iraq.  Ozturk said that humanitarian </p><p>relief was within the mandate of the International Federation </p><p>of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International </p><p>Committee of the Red Cross in Iraq, and that the GOT wanted </p><p>to work closely with UN agencies as well.  He said the GOT\'s </p><p>principal concern was to assure centralized and coordinated </p><p>humanitarian relief, with the Turkish Red Crescent as the </p><p>focal point.  However, Ozturk said that the GOT was </p><p>considering whether and how to bring NGOs into its </p><p>contingency planning and said an interagency meeting on this </p><p>subject was to be held later on January 7.  There was, he </p><p>said, little prospect for resolving the problem of NGO access </p><p>to northern Iraq through Turkey even if a decision was made </p><p>to let NGOs participate in Turkish relief efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Predictions:  While acknowledging that there were as </p><p>yet too many unknowns to predict humanitarian need connected </p><p>with an operation in Iraq, Ozturk opined that a mass movement </p><p>towards Turkish borders was not likely unless the threat </p><p>facing the population were extreme (e.g chemical/biological </p><p>warfare, proximate armed conflict).  He said that IDPs were </p><p>likely to move just far enough within Iraq to avoid immediate </p><p>danger and would probably aim to stay within the country </p><p>rather than seek shelter in Turkish camps guarded by Turkish </p><p>soldiers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prime Ministry </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) On January 3, DCM and Econoff met with Mustafa Cetin, </p><p>the newly-appointed Deputy Undersecretary in the Prime </p><p>Ministry, to discuss GOT refugee/internally displaced persons </p><p>contingency planning.  Adil Ozdemir, General Directorate of </p><p>Turkish Emergency Management, and Ilgin Atalay, head of the </p><p>Prime Ministry\'s Foreign Relations Department, also attended. </p><p> DCM emphasized that the USG still hopes that military </p><p>operations can be avoided through peaceful disarmament of </p><p>Iraq, but that it is prudent to plan for the possibility of a </p><p>refugee/IDP problem on Turkey\'s frontier.  He also suggested </p><p>that any possible crisis will be much easier to handle to the </p><p>extent that our two governments can cooperate fully and </p><p>coordinate activities.  DCM asked for the GOT\'s thinking in </p><p>handling this problem, particularly with respect to </p><p>assistance that may become available from private </p><p>humanitarian organizations.  He also noted that the USG had </p><p>begun to collect mapping information on humanitarian </p><p>facilities and personnel in Iraq, and asked Cetin if the GOT </p><p>had any information to share on this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) Noting the strain on Turkey of the influx of </p><p>refugees/IDPs in 1988 and 1991, Cetin said that the GOT had </p><p>done considerable contingency planning and hoped to be better </p><p>prepared if a similar crisis arose in the near future. </p><p>However, he suggested that Embassy contact MFA\'s Multilateral </p><p>Political Affairs General Directorate and Kizilay for a more </p><p>detailed information, including on humanitarian mapping. </p><p>Cetin expressed interest in cooperating with NGOs in </p><p>providing assistance, and told us he would discuss this </p><p>further with MFA.  He suggested that Kizilay should be the </p><p>point of contact for those organizations.  Cetin thanked DCM </p><p>for the United States\' interest in raising these issues and </p><p>its willingness to cooperate in this area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Econoff and Medical Attache met with Fatih Evren, </p><p>General Director of the Turkish Red Crescent, on January 6 on </p><p>these issues.  Evren stated that there were gaps in the Red </p><p>Crescent\'s supplies relative to expected need in the event of </p><p>a crisis, and that he would consult with the Red Crescent\'s </p><p>President on a list of needed items to be shared with the </p><p>USG.  On the role of NGOs in providing relief, Evren noted </p><p>negative experiences with certain NGOs after the Gulf War and </p><p>stated that the Red Crescent preferred to work only with </p><p>UNHCR and other UN agencies.  However, he added that this </p><p>decision was up to the GOT and suggested that we raise this </p><p>with MFA.  On the humanitarian mapping request, Evren </p><p>responded that Red Crescent had no presence in northern Iraq </p><p>and referred us to MFA on this also.  Evren expressed concern </p><p>that the Red Crescent was unprepared to provide assistance or </p><p>treat refugees/IDPs in the context of use of </p><p>chemical/biological weapons.  Medical Attache offered to </p><p>provide medical information on planning and treating patients </p><p>connected with CBW attacks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UNHCR </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) Econoff met with Steven Corliss, Deputy Turkey </p><p>Representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, on </p><p>December 30 to request that UNHCR provide data on the </p><p>locations of its operations in Iraq through UNSECOORD </p><p>(reftel).  Corliss noted that, although UNHCR Turkey did not </p><p>have any personnel or sites in Iraq, this could change if </p><p>UNHCR staff in Iraq were evacuated in connection with </p><p>military operations.  He told us that he would report the </p><p>demarche to UNSECOORD and would also relay our request to the </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) On contingency planning, Corliss told us that UNHCR </p><p>planned to open a regional center in Diyarbakir in the event </p><p>of a refugee/internally displaced person crisis, and that it </p><p>already had staff in Van and Silopi.  On the issue of </p><p>preparedness for providing assistance to refugees/IDPs who </p><p>may have been exposed to chemical/biological weapons, Corliss </p><p>confirmed that UN agencies would evacuate if CBW were used. </p><p>He added that he assumed the Turkish and U.S. militaries had </p><p>plans for this contingency, but told us that Red Crescent had </p><p>not. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (S) Embassy believes we have reached the stage where it </p><p>would be useful to begin sharing further information with the </p><p>Turks on USG contingency planning, particularly the roles we </p><p>contemplate for NGOs in our response to a crisis and our </p><p>ability to address any gaps in Turkish relief supplies. </p><p>IDP/refugee issues are and will continue to be an integral </p><p>part of the mil-mil talks, but we need soon to begin </p><p>integrating our proposals and supply chain with the Turkish </p><p>civilian and UN response plans.  That would include beginning </p><p>to identify for the GOT and establishing a linkage with any </p><p>USAID/DART or NGO elements that are part of our proposal. </p><p>Please advise. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
