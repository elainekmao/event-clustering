<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001757 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL/LP, INR/B, AND WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KCRM, KJUS, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MORE HONDURAN CONGRESSMEN ACCUSED OF CRIMINAL </p><p>ACTIVITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  The Honduran Public Ministry (PM) announced </p><p>last week that it has begun legal proceedings against two </p><p>more Honduran elected officials.  On July 10, Attorney </p><p>General Roy Medina announced that his office will bring </p><p>charges against alternative National Party (PN) Congressman </p><p>Melvin Tomas Regalado for aiding the November 2002 escape of </p><p>a man sentenced to nine years in prison for armed robbery. </p><p>Similarly, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment, </p><p>Juan Francisco Gonzalez, said that Liberal Party (PL) </p><p>alternative Congressman Mauro Caballero was being </p><p>investigated for destruction of the environment in a </p><p>protected area.  The PM plans to ask the Honduran Supreme </p><p>Court to lift each officials\' immunity in order to prosecute </p><p>their cases. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Regalado Accused of Aiding Jail Break </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The PM announced last week that it is beginning legal </p><p>proceedings against two more Honduran elected officials.  In </p><p>the case of alternative PN Congressman Melvin Tomas Regalado, </p><p>Attorney General Roy Medina asked the Supreme Court to set </p><p>aside the congressman\'s immunity and issue a warrant for his </p><p>arrest.  Regalado is accused of aiding the escape of Amilcar </p><p>Antonio Portillo, sentenced to nine years in prison for armed </p><p>robbery.  According to the Public Ministry, Portillo walked </p><p>away from the Central Penitentiary on November 15, 2002 after </p><p>Regalado presented a letter to prison officials on National </p><p>Congress letterhead authorizing his release for the weekend. </p><p>An ex-director of the Preventative Special Services (the law </p><p>enforcement branch responsible for the prison system) and the </p><p>former head of the Central Penitentiary are already being </p><p>held without bail awaiting trial for their part in the escape. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Caballero Accused of Damaging the Environment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On July 10, Assistant Attorney General for the </p><p>Environment, Juan Francisco Gonzalez, submitted a report to </p><p>Attorney General Medina recommending that the Public Ministry </p><p>ask the Supreme Court to lift the immunity of Liberal Party </p><p>(PL) alternative Congressman Mauro Caballero, and issue him a </p><p>court summons.  Caballero is accused of deforesting an area </p><p>around a lagoon on his property in Villanueva, Cortes that </p><p>had been designated as a protected area.  Following the </p><p>announcement, the local press published numerous photographs </p><p>of the area in question, complete with felled trees, a dried </p><p>up lagoon bed, and dead turtles.  Juan Carlos Caballero, the </p><p>son of the accused, told local media that it is his family\'s </p><p>property and that they could do whatever they wanted with it. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) COMMENT:  The legal proceedings against Regalado and </p><p>Caballero indicate that the PM has finally begun to move </p><p>against high-profile individuals, something that Post has </p><p>been urging for some time.  These positive steps, coupled </p><p>with increased public pressure stemming from the recent </p><p>arrests of Central American Parliament Representative Cesar </p><p>Diaz and National Congress Deputy Armando Avila Panchame on </p><p>unrelated narcotrafficking charges, will help keep pressure </p><p>on lawmakers to keep their promise to repeal Honduras,s </p><p>immunity laws.  It also demonstrates some progress on the </p><p>Maduro Administration\'s pledge to end impunity and apply the </p><p>criminal justice code more uniformly. END COMMENT </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
