O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, EFIN, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Tobacco harvest may beat early forecasts </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: It remains difficult to forecast Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>all-important tobacco earnings this year.  Experts agree </p><p>the harvest will be marginally better than initially </p><p>expected, but a steep drop from last year. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. The stakes are high since tobacco will remain </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s leading export and earner of foreign exchange. </p><p>Also, the GOZ desperately wants newly-resettled </p><p>commercial farmers (known as A2s) to produce sizable </p><p>crops and lend legitimacy to its controversial land </p><p>reform.  Last year\'s harvest yielded 166 million kgs, </p><p>down from the record year 2000 crop of 237 million kgs. </p><p>Experts still disagree how far tobacco output will slide. </p><p> </p><p>High-End Scenarios </p><p>------------------ </p><p>3. GOZ hawks still occasionally boast about a 150-200 </p><p>million kg harvest, but objective and independent sources </p><p>dismiss these numbers.  The Tobacco Industry Marketing </p><p>Board (TIMB), a somewhat independent governmental body </p><p>with a commendable forecast record, told us it is now </p><p>expecting a 85-110 million kg harvest this year, a drop </p><p>of between 33 and 48 percent.  TIMB Executive Director </p><p>Stanley Mutepfa said his agency has been unable to nail </p><p>down a more precise figure for 2003 due to the chaotic </p><p>state of Zimbabwe\'s agricultural sector.  Usually the </p><p>TIMB offers a crop estimate by February 1 for the year </p><p>that is within 5 percent of the final result.  Although </p><p>Zimbabwe has been hard hit by drought, Mutepfa said </p><p>recent weather conditions have been good for many </p><p>communal tobacco growers in the 7 of 15 districts he has </p><p>surveyed, causing the TIMB to increase its estimate. </p><p>Most communal farmers did not plant until December, when </p><p>they enjoyed 4 weeks of dry weather followed by rains, </p><p>the ideal scenario for non-irrigated tobacco. </p><p> </p><p>Low-End Scenarios </p><p>----------------- </p><p>4. Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) Chief Executive </p><p>Chris Molam told us his organization has upped the </p><p>estimate he offered to the Parliamentary Committee on </p><p>Agriculture on Oct 8 from 70-to-80 million kgs.  But he </p><p>said he is confident the harvest will not beat 80 million </p><p>kgs, since he is already factoring in a respectable </p><p>increase for communal as well as A2 farmers from 12-to-25 </p><p>million kgs. (He expects 55 million kgs from large </p><p>commercial farmers).  FEWSNET Representative Elliot </p><p>Vhurumuku, an expert in crop forecasts, estimates the </p><p>tobacco crop slightly higher, at 80-85 million kgs. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. Given initial predictions of Zimbabwean harvests as </p><p>low as 60 million kgs, the slightly higher estimates pass </p><p>for good news.  Nonetheless, the economic cost of land </p><p>reform is still enormous.  Without it, 2003 would have </p><p>been a banner year for tobacco growers here.  The country </p><p>is unlikely to return to lofty 2000 heights unless it </p><p>sorts out an inept land redistribution that exudes </p><p>opacity. </p><p> </p><p>6. Several other variables could affect the country\'s </p><p>tobacco windfall this year.  Difficult climate conditions </p><p>in Brazil have diminished its expected harvest from 600 </p><p>to 515 million kgs, reducing the year\'s supply and </p><p>potentially increasing the world tobacco price.  On the </p><p>other hand, Zimbabwe\'s erratic coal supplies from Wankie </p><p>Colliery could hinder the curing of tobacco before it </p><p>reaches the auction floor -- or create a new market for </p><p>wood as a less-efficient coal substitute.  More </p><p>importantly, the GOZ still has not disclosed how much </p><p>export revenue it will allow growers to retain (probably </p><p>through a special exchange rate).  If the rate is too </p><p>low, we\'re guessing farmers will smuggle tobacco out of </p><p>the country or store it for a future year. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
