Weekend editorials continue to focus on President </p><p>      Bush\'s first trip to Africa.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Rude awakening awaits Bush" the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "Sunday News" (06/29) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The announcement that U. S. President George W. </p><p>      Bush, whose hands are dripping with the blood of </p><p>      brave Iraqi soldiers and defenseless Iraqi women and </p><p>      children, is set to visit Africa from 7 to 12 July </p><p>      should surely send chills in the spines of </p><p>      independent thinking, peace loving Africans and anti- </p><p>      imperial forces on the continent.  Already one such </p><p>      peace loving statesman on the African continent. . </p><p>      .Mr. Nelson Mandela has set the tone for the sort of </p><p>      reception which Bush should expect from independent </p><p>      Africans when he visits next month. . .The United </p><p>      States leader, George W. Bush is now a loose canon </p><p>      in world politics. . .It is clear therefore that </p><p>      during his visit to Africa, Bush will try and </p><p>      influence African leaders to `rein in\' President </p><p>      Mugabe who is exposing U. S.\'s hegemonic tendencies </p><p>      in return for aid.  Americans are known for their </p><p>      belief in the carrot and stick approach as a </p><p>      political arsenal in world politics. . .Like what he </p><p>      did in Iraq, he is playing the savior for what he </p><p>      regards as `poor Zimbabweans\' under a dictatorship. </p><p>      Such a patronizing attitude can never be brooked by </p><p>      any serious independent African both in the </p><p>      continent and in the Diaspora unless they are </p><p>      prepared for the re-colonization of the continent. </p><p>      There is no need for U. S. involvement in the </p><p>      solution of the problems bedeviling </p><p>      Zimbabweans. . .If America is genuinely interested </p><p>      in helping Zimbabweans solve their problems it </p><p>      should stop fuelling politics of hatred and </p><p>      sponsoring attempts to overthrow a legitimate </p><p>      government. . .The British and American machinations </p><p>      to isolate Zimbabwe are well documented and so is </p><p>      the resistance by African countries to be used in </p><p>      this game. . .We therefore call upon all Africans to </p><p>      continue with this African solidarity when Bush </p><p>      visits the continent next month.  Africans for </p><p>      Africans - that should be the guiding rule. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Act against American meddling" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" (06/28) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The world, it appears, is yet to see more of </p><p>      American meddling and indiscriminate bullying at the </p><p>      instigation of the Bush administration.  This is the </p><p>      same administration that took over from Bill Clinton </p><p>      and further dented the credibility of the United </p><p>      Nations.  The U. N. could be mistaken for some </p><p>      department in Bush\'s administration since he can </p><p>      veto its decisions and out rightly defy others with </p><p>      no fear of punishment.  While the rest of the world </p><p>      has complained about the flagrant disregard for </p><p>      international law where the U. S. seeks to protect </p><p>      or expand its interests, very little had come our </p><p>      way from the State\'s people with regard to the way </p><p>      it conducts its business, and even other </p><p>      people\'s. . .Zimbabwe, in its small way has tried to </p><p>      play its part in bringing order to the region by </p><p>      sending its troops to trouble spots on the </p><p>      continent, with the most recent under the auspices </p><p>      of SADC, in the DRC.  However, the Americans have </p><p>      been the stumbling block since they have backed the </p><p>      two countries whose armies invaded the DRC. . .To </p><p>      this day, that country has not seen peace, and the </p><p>      U. S. seems content. . .And the plunder by a country </p><p>      that fails to run its own elections yet accusing all </p><p>      other countries of failing to run theirs, seems to </p><p>      be going a gear up amid reports that Bush will be </p><p>      visiting the Southern African region, where he is </p><p>      threatening to unleash his disastrous recipe on </p><p>      Zimbabwe.  He is so obsessed with regime change </p><p>      throughout the world under the false belief that it </p><p>      would guarantee him some emperor tag. . .Zimbabwe is </p><p>      presently under Western-imposed sanctions.  So was </p><p>      Iraqi before the American invasion that has resulted </p><p>      in misery for the Iraqi people.  The U. N. has to </p><p>      act against the continued invasions or the little </p><p>      that remains of its credibility will vanish. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
