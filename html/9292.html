Under headline "Tsvangirai exhibits inferiority </p><p>      complex" the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald" dedicated its July 10 editorial to hailing </p><p>      President George W. Bush and his South African </p><p>      counterpart Thabo Mbeki for coming up with a shared </p><p>      position on how to resolve Zimbabwe\'s political and </p><p>      economic crisis.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .Yesterday, (Movement for Democratic Change </p><p>      (MDC)leader Morgan Tsvangirai) was told loud and clear that </p><p>      whatever he wants in Washington he must go through the </p><p>      South African President, Thabo Mbeki, whom he has lately </p><p>      described as a dishonest broker.  His political immaturity </p><p>      and incorrigibility has truly gone international - he wants </p><p>      to appeal to the American President to take over the </p><p>      brokerage of the discussion between his party and the </p><p>      ruling ZANU PF party.  Instead of winning friends, </p><p>      Tsvangirai has sought to demonize those he expected to help </p><p>      him like insulting President Mbeki as an `imperialist.\'  He </p><p>      has sought to demean African heads of state at every turn </p><p>      while pandering to European and American leaders like a </p><p>      poodle.  The South African President smartly told Bush that </p><p>      the Zimbabwean problem was a domestic issue that needed a </p><p>      home-grown solution and not one baked in Washington.  The </p><p>      American President saw no offense in this and agreed that </p><p>      he follow the lead of President Mbeki. . .The MDC has had </p><p>      the comfort of being told by small American and British </p><p>      bureaucrats that the American President will be sending </p><p>      troops to remove President Mugabe from power and Tsvangirai </p><p>      and his lieutenants have fallen for this lie.  But </p><p>      yesterday they had a good wake-up call - no such thing will </p><p>      happen.  If Bush is struggling to decide whether he should </p><p>      send American troops to Liberia then this should be food </p><p>      for thought for the opposition. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
