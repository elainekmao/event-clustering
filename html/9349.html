<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004251 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PLANS FOR MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS MOVE FORWARD, </p><p>DESPITE OBJECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 4189 </p><p> </p><p>1.  A controversial amendment to Jordan,s Municipal Law has </p><p>come under fire from nearly a third of the members of the </p><p>country,s newly elected parliament. Between 30 and 40 MPs </p><p>have signed and circulated a petition calling on the </p><p>government to delay the country,s municipal elections, </p><p>scheduled for July 26.  They plan to present the petition to </p><p>the government once Parliament convenes on 16 July. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The November 2002 temporary law authorizes the government </p><p>to appoint mayors and up to half of the council members in </p><p>the country,s 99 municipalities.  The petition drive is </p><p>being spearheaded by Islamic Action Front (IAF) MPs, whose </p><p>party recently announced its intentions to boycott all </p><p>municipal elections outside Amman (reported reftel).  All 18 </p><p>IAF MPs, in addition to a number of independent members, have </p><p>lent their signatures to this initiative. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Despite the protest, Municipal, Rural, and Environmental </p><p>Affairs Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat announced that the </p><p>government would proceed with its preparations for municipal </p><p>elections and hold them as scheduled.  Having not seen the </p><p>petition himself, the minister refused to comment on it.  He </p><p>stressed that the amendment to the Municipal Law in November </p><p>2002, one of hundreds of &temporary laws8 promulgated by </p><p>GOJ while Parliament was dissolved, was part of a </p><p>comprehensive restructuring plan for the financially strapped </p><p>and administratively challenged municipal sector.  The </p><p>government began the plan in 2001, securing additional funds </p><p>for municipalities and reducing their number by more than </p><p>two-thirds. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Contrary to rumors ripe in the capital, &no appointments </p><p>(to municipal councils) have been made so far,8 insisted </p><p>Tbeishat.  He said the government had decided to appoint 460 </p><p>members, including mayors, and give the public a chance to </p><p>elect 536 members.  Before last year,s amendment, mayors and </p><p>all municipal council members were elected.  The government </p><p>has rebuffed critics of its amendment, arguing the measure </p><p>had to be adopted as part of its municipal restructuring </p><p>program to make municipalities both financially viable and </p><p>more responsive to public needs. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
