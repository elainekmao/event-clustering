<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 03296 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINS, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: INTELLECTUAL LEADERSHIP </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS, THE HEADLINE NEWS HAS </p><p>BEEN SADDAM\'S MEETINGS WITH A "GROUP" WHICH IS </p><p>MAKING THE FINAL CHANGES IN THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION </p><p>PRIOR TO DISCUSSION BY THE RCC AND THE PARTY\'S </p><p>REGIONAL COMMAND. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WE THINK DEPARTMENT\'S BIOGRAPHIC FILES SHOULD </p><p>REFLECT THE NAMES OF THE SIX-MEMBER GROUP WHO </p><p>SADDAM HAS SPENT SO MANY HOURS WITH ON THIS </p><p>IMPORTANT PROJECT AND WHOSE VIEWS, THEREFORE, </p><p>WE ASSUME HE VALUES.  ALL SIX, WEARING THEIR </p><p>PARTY UNIFORMS, ARE PICTURED IN THE MEDIA </p><p>SITTING IN WHAT IS OFTEN USED AS THE CABINET ROOM. </p><p>THEY ARE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTERS SA\'DUN HAMMADI AND </p><p>TARIQ AZIZ, FLANKING THE PRESIDENT, PRESUMABLY </p><p>REFLECTING THEIR SENIOR STATUS.  NEXT TO TARIQ </p><p>AZIZ IS SPEAKER SALIH (WHO IS CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>BAGHDAD BRANCH OF THE PARTY); AND THEN AHMAD </p><p>HUSAYN AL-SAMARA\'I.  THE LATTER CARRIES THE RANK OF </p><p>A CABINET MINISTER HAVING BEEN MINISTER OF YOUTH; </p><p>HE.IS NOW SYG OF THE PRESIDENT\'S DIWAN AND, WE </p><p>ARE TOLD, HIS "FRIEND."  FLANKING SA\'DUN IS </p><p>MINISTER OF INFORMATION JASIM AND, FINALLY, HAMID </p><p>YUSUF HUMMADI. </p><p> </p><p>4.  HUMMADI, WITH WHOM THE AMBASSADOR FIRST HAD </p><p>A SUBSTANTIVE EXCHANGE WHEN SHE WAS TRAPPED WITH </p><p>HIM IN AN ELEVATOR DURING THE DOLE VISIT LAST </p><p>MONTH, IS A TIKRITI AND A GRADUATE OF BAGHDAD </p><p>UNIVERSITY IN ENGLISH.  DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE </p><p>HIS BASIC BIO, WHICH SHOWS HIS APPOINTMENT IN </p><p>EARLY 1979 AS THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S DIWAN, THEN LATER THAT YEAR AS THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S PERSONAL SECRETARY.  HIS ENGLISH IS </p><p>EXCELLENT, AND WE ARE TOLD HE STUDIED WITH </p><p>TARIQ AZIZ, WHO IS HIS GOOD FRIEND.  HIS POWER IS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE; E.G., A CALL FROM HIM STOPPED THE </p><p>MINISTER OF INTERIOR IN HIS TRACKS AFTER HE HAD </p><p>ORDERED THE REMOVAL OF THE CHECKPOINT IN FRONT </p><p>OF THE EMBASSY LAST MONTH, AND WE WERE IN RECEIPT </p><p>OF PROFUSE APOLOGIES FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
