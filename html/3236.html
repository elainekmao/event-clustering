<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003622 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ETRD, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S ENERGY MINISTER DISCUSSES PIPELINE ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: CAIRO 5992 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Jordanian Energy Minister Mohammed Bataineh briefed </p><p>DCM and econoff on recent developments on the Egypt-Jordan </p><p>gas pipeline and the Iraq-Zarqa oil pipeline.  The projects </p><p>could save Jordan a combined $50 million per year on their </p><p>current energy bill.  Meanwhile, Jordan is moving closer to </p><p>privatizing the power generation and distribution sectors, </p><p>with the expectation of privatization revenues by June of </p><p>2003.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>EGYPT GAS PIPELINE MOVING FORWARD </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  In a June 24 meeting, Jordanian Energy Minister </p><p>Mohammed Bataineh downplayed an announcement that a </p><p>joint-venture company had been formed by Syrian, Lebanese, </p><p>Jordanian and Egyptian interests to develop the Al Arish gas </p><p>pipeline (reftel).  According to Bataineh, the JV is a Syrian </p><p>government-backed scheme to try to secure soft loans from </p><p>regional development funds like the Kuwaiti fund to support </p><p>the project.  The JV concept, Bataineh said, has never been </p><p>popular with the GOJ or with Egypt, both of whom prefer to </p><p>develop their sections of the line through private sector </p><p>means (in Jordan, through a BOOT tender).  As the arrangement </p><p>now stands, Egypt and Jordan will go ahead with their </p><p>original plans to develop their sections independently, with </p><p>each of the four JV partner countries having the option to </p><p>participate in development of the line from the Jordan/Syria </p><p>border northward through the JV.  Bataineh said development </p><p>of the Arish-Aqaba segment is proceeding apace, and predicted </p><p>gas would be flowing in Aqaba by April 2003. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Bataineh expressed relief that this issue had been </p><p>settled, since progress on the pipeline deal is a necessary </p><p>precondition for Belgian energy giant Tractebel to move </p><p>forward with its own plans to build an independent power </p><p>production (IPP) facility north of Amman.  Bataineh noted </p><p>that the pipeline would probably save Jordan at least $30 </p><p>million per year at the outset as the Aqaba power station </p><p>switched from fuel oil (1.5 million tons/year) to gas </p><p>turbines.  It would also reduce Jordan\'s energy dependence on </p><p>Iraq by reducing its oil imports. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Bataineh noted with some humor that there are still </p><p>a number of questions about the future of the pipeline from </p><p>the Syrian border northward.  First, there is still </p><p>disagreement about whether the line will go through Lebanon </p><p>to ports in northern Syria, or straight through Syria with a </p><p>spur to Lebanon.  In addition, it is unclear how much gas </p><p>will be available north of the border.  There is still some </p><p>debate whether to use a 30-inch or 36-inch diameter pipe to </p><p>convey the gas, with the group leaning toward the 30-inch </p><p>pipe.  Such a pipe, Bataineh said, has a capacity of around 7 </p><p>bcm/year.  Jordan\'s consumption will be 2.5-3.0 bcm, and </p><p>Lebanon\'s about the same.  This would leave about 1 bcm for </p><p>delivery to Syria or other customers.  Cyprus has already </p><p>voiced interest in receiving the gas, with a current need of </p><p>1 bcm/year and 3-4 bmc/year by 2006.  Bataineh said Syria had </p><p>assured Cyprus it would have excess gas to export, but said </p><p>he has seen no evidence of such Syrian reserves. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ZARQA PIPELINE STALLED </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Bataineh confirmed that a closing date for bids on </p><p>the proposed crude pipeline to Zarqa has been postponed at </p><p>the request of bidders, who are seeking more time to study </p><p>the technical merits of the project.  He said financing is a </p><p>major issue, as commercial lenders for many bidders have </p><p>serious questions about political risk for the project. </p><p>Bataineh clarified that the project has no/no Iraqi </p><p>component.  Instead, the plan is to build an initial pumping </p><p>station on the Jordanian side of the border, with oil </p><p>crossing the border by truck from Iraq and off-loading at the </p><p>pumping station.  From there, a pipeline will convey crude to </p><p>the Zarqa refinery.  Bataineh said the current transportation </p><p>system costs around $50 million per year, versus a 5-6 year </p><p>buyback period on a BOOT project of $150 million, for a cost </p><p>savings of $20 million per year over that period.  In </p><p>addition to this project, Bataineh said the Zarqa refinery\'s </p><p>Board of Directors is discussing refinery upgrades that could </p><p>cost as much as $900 million. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ELECTRICITY PRIVATIZATIONS - IN THE PIPELINE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (u)  Bataineh said the GOJ is eager to move forward with </p><p>long-planned privatizations of the kingdom\'s electricity </p><p>generation and distribution facilities.  Further progress </p><p>must wait, he said, for changes to the current electricity </p><p>law that are currently before the cabinet.  Bataineh </p><p>expressed confidence that the changes will be approved soon. </p><p>Once the legal framework is in place, RFP\'s will be issued </p><p>and bidders confirmed.  Bataineh guessed that privatization </p><p>revenues from the sector would begin entering government </p><p>coffers by June 2003, helping to finance year two of the </p><p>GOJ\'s Program for Social and Economic Transformation (PSET). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  Jordan\'s commitment to diversifying its energy </p><p>sources and to rationalizing the power sector remains strong, </p><p>driven in large part by a desire to reduce its dependency on </p><p>Iraq as an energy source.  Tractebel\'s unwillingness to move </p><p>forward on its IPP until the gas pipeline issue was sorted </p><p>out gives a strong indication that the new plant will likely </p><p>be gas-fired.  This, coupled with the switch to gas in Aqaba </p><p>and privatization of power generation, would virtually free </p><p>Jordan\'s electricity supply from dependence on Iraqi oil. </p><p>Nevertheless, even with these welcome changes, Jordan will </p><p>remain reliant on Iraq for its other oil needs (crude and </p><p>refined products like kerosene and gasoline) - a $300 </p><p>million-plus Iraqi energy subsidy. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
