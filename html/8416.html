<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000475 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIRF, PGOV, PHUM, VM, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: THICH QUANG DO UNDER "ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>SURVEILLANCE" UNTIL SEPTEMBER 3, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) 01 HANOI 1340   B) FBIS SEP 20010608000100 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The Most Venerable Thich Quang Do remains </p><p>under  "administrative surveillance," based on a </p><p>decree, which although dated June 1, 2001, in fact has </p><p>an effective time period of September 3, 1998 until </p><p>September 3, 2003.  Post has seen at least one press </p><p>release denouncing Thich Quang Do\'s continued "pagoda </p><p>arrest" past June 1, but wishes to clarify that </p><p>according to the refs and recent confirmation from </p><p>Thich Tue Sy, September 3, 2003 has always been the </p><p>correct expiration date. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A junior monk whose duties have included </p><p>looking after Thich Quang Do, related to Thich Tue Sy </p><p>that Thich Quang Do is in good health and looks </p><p>forward to being freed from administrative </p><p>surveillance on September 3.  Thich Tue Sy attributed </p><p>any confusion over the expiration date to overlapping </p><p>decisions that were issued upon Thich Quang Do\'s </p><p>release from prison in September 1998 under a special </p><p>amnesty, and subsequently on May 31 and June 1, 2001. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Thich Quang Do was originally sentenced to </p><p>five years\' imprisonment and five years\' </p><p>administrative surveillance in 1995.  Upon his release </p><p>in September 1998, he was still subject to the five- </p><p>year administrative surveillance requirement until </p><p>September 3, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) After Thich Quang Do\'s failed attempt to </p><p>"rescue" The Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang from his </p><p>pagoda in Quy Nhon and return with him to HCMC in May </p><p>2001, two other decisions were issued on May 31 and </p><p>June 1, 2001.  These decisions reaffirmed that the </p><p>original five-year administrative surveillance period </p><p>was still in effect until September 3, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Post will continue to keep in contact with </p><p>those close to Thich Quang Do and monitor the </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
