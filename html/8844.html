<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000724 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND DRL </p><p>USMISSION NEW YORK FOR AMBASSADOR TWINING </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, Human Rights, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: AUNG SAN SUU KYI REPORTEDLY BEING HELD IN </p><p>RANGOON\'S INSEIN PRISON </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUALA LUMPUR 3628 </p><p>     B. RANGOON 682 </p><p>     C. AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ.  REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1) (C) Summary:  Leon de Reidmatten (Special Envoy Razali\'s </p><p>liaison in Rangoon) informed COM and EU Ambassadors that, </p><p>according to the SE, Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) was in Insein </p><p>Prison in Rangoon.  ASSK told Razali she believed that she </p><p>was being held under the provisions of Section 10(a) of a </p><p>1975 law titled "Law to Safeguard the State Against the </p><p>Dangers of Subversive Elements".  This law allows for the </p><p>"detaining and arresting" of an individual, and holding that </p><p>individual for up to five years in a detention facility. </p><p>ASSK has never been held under 10(a) before.  Her previous </p><p>periods of detention were under house arrest.  De Reidmatten </p><p>said he has already informed ICRC that ASSK is being held in </p><p>Insein prison, but he added that he did not believe ICRC </p><p>would be successful in seeing her any time soon.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2) (C) Leon de Reidmatten (Special Envoy Razali\'s liaison in </p><p>Rangoon) briefed the COM, and the French, German, Italian and </p><p>UK ambassadors on Thursday, June 19, upon his return from </p><p>meeting with the SE in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, June 17.  He </p><p>told the group that, according to the SE, the site of </p><p>Razali\'s meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon was Insein </p><p>Prison.  He said that ASSK was being held in a special </p><p>freestanding two-room cell, with toilet facilities, that had </p><p>been built specifically for her in the mid- 1990\'s, although </p><p>she has never occupied it before (Note:  de Reidmatten </p><p>actually saw this structure when he was visiting Insein in </p><p>connection with his previous job with the ICRC.  End Note). </p><p>ASSK is being guarded by three female prison guards. </p><p> </p><p>3) (C) Razali told de Reidmatten that ASSK said she believed </p><p>she was being held under the provisions of Section  10(a) of </p><p>a 1975 law titled "Law to Safeguard the State Against the </p><p>Dangers of Subversive Elements".  This law allows for the </p><p>"detaining and arresting" of an individual, and holding that </p><p>individual for up to five years in a detention facility </p><p>(Note: in practice, many prisoners are held longer under </p><p>10(a) and it is also used to detain prisoners even after they </p><p>have completed their formal sentences.  End Note).  Another </p><p>section of this law, Section 10(b), allows for the </p><p>"restraining" of individuals for up to one year under house </p><p>arrest, but the period can be extended, as has been the case </p><p>previously with ASSK (Note: the ten members of the NLD </p><p>Central Executive Committee are (CEC) are apparently being </p><p>held under this provision, confirming what the guards in </p><p>front of two of the CEC members\' houses let slip to COM when </p><p>she tried to visit on June 1.  End Note). </p><p> </p><p>4) (C) Although we do not know on what ASSK bases her belief </p><p>that she and the members of the CEC (and possibly many </p><p>others), are being held in order to "Safeguard the State", </p><p>the regime\'s clumsy pretense that they are under "protective </p><p>custody" is ridiculous and insulting.  In response to direct </p><p>questioning by the COM on several occasions, both privately </p><p>and publicly, the Deputy Foreign Minister and the Minister of </p><p>Home Affairs denied that ASSK or the members of the CEC are </p><p>under arrest.  Perhaps technically, this is true - perhaps </p><p>they are being detained or restrained and not arrested.  But </p><p>the fact is they are prisoners, and probably will be for a </p><p>long time. </p><p> </p><p>5)  (C) De Reidmatten told COM he wrote to the Minister of </p><p>Home Affairs to ask if ASSK was being held under 10(a), but </p><p>the Minister has not confirmed, denied, or clarified the </p><p>conditions of her detention.  De Reidmatten said he has </p><p>already informed ICRC that ASSK is being held in Insein </p><p>prison, but he added that he did not believe ICRC would be </p><p>successful in seeing her any time soon. </p><p> </p><p>6)  (C) Comment: The briefing from de Reidmatten is the first </p><p>time that anyone in the group had heard from Razali as to </p><p>ASSK\'s specific location or conditions of detention. This is </p><p>also the first time that we have heard that ASSK told Razali </p><p>she believed that she was being held under 10(a).  ASSK has </p><p>never been held under 10(a) before.  Her previous periods of </p><p>detention were house arrest under the provisions of 10 (b). </p><p>"Detaining and arresting" ASSK under Section 10(a) would </p><p>signal that the regime may be determined to retain a tight </p><p>grip on her and the NLD for a very long time to come and does </p><p>nothing to support their claims of commitment to the process </p><p>of national reconciliation.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
