<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/SA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, CASC, KPAO, NP, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01:  NEPAL REACTIONS TO WAR IN IRAQ FOR MARCH </p><p>27 </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 0545 </p><p> </p><p>1.  PROTESTS AND MISSION SECURITY:  The Embassy maintained </p><p>full services and normal working hours on March 27.  As of </p><p>3:00 p.m. local time, Embassy knows of no protests in the </p><p>capital against the war in Iraq or against the U.S.  A small </p><p>anti-war protest in downtown Kathmandu on March 26 apparently </p><p>fizzled out because of inclement weather conditions and did </p><p>not reach the Embassy.  The Nepali-language press reported on </p><p>March 27 that a student group in midwestern Pyuthan District </p><p>(approximately 300 km from Kathmandu) had held a protest </p><p>rally on March 26.  According to reports, the students burned </p><p>an effigy of President Bush and chanted anti-American slogans. </p><p> </p><p>2.  MEDIA OPINION:  Major newspapers carried wire service </p><p>reports of the fighting in Iraq, with the 14 casualties in a </p><p>Baghdad marketplace claiming most headlines.  For the second </p><p>consecutive day, pro-Indian daily "The Himalayan" carried </p><p>anti-war editorials republished from the "The Guardian" in </p><p>London.  "The Kathmandu Post," the leading English daily, </p><p>printed a local editorial entitled "Economic Implications of </p><p>War," which predicted a downturn in tourism, posited (without </p><p>any supporting evidence) that "the export sector has been </p><p>badly affected," and (spuriously) linked the Gulf conflict to </p><p>hikes in local petroleum prices. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PRO-US SUPPORT:  On March 27 the Ambassador received a </p><p>letter from a local Nepali businessman expressing "special </p><p>thanks to the US Government for taking a hard step against </p><p>Iraq to make stability and peace in the Middle East and all </p><p>over the world." </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
