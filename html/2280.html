<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 10 ABUJA 003162 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W; DON BOOTH AND SOOKY PARK </p><p>ALSO FOR AF/EPS </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID-AFR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ESF PROPOSALS FOR FY 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  The following is Embassy Abuja\'s ESF funding proposals </p><p>for FY 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FY 2002 ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUNDS </p><p>U.S. Mission Nigeria Proposals </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Program Overview </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria has significant strategic value to the United States. </p><p> The world\'s eighth largest oil producer, Nigeria ranks as </p><p>the fifth largest supplier to the United States, providing </p><p>ten percent of total U.S. oil imports.  Nigeria also is a </p><p>potential major supplier of natural gas, having the eighth </p><p>largest reserve in the world.  Nigeria commands Africa\'s </p><p>second largest economy, is the largest U.S. trading partner </p><p>on the continent, and represents a huge potential market for </p><p>American producers.  Moreover, Nigeria stands as the dominant </p><p>economic and political actor in the West African sub-region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a population of over 120 million, Nigeria is Africa\'s </p><p>most populous nation and its largest democracy.  It also has </p><p>Africa\'s largest Islamic population, numbering roughly 60 </p><p>million Muslims.  A stable, prosperous Nigeria that values </p><p>democracy and its processes will improve the lot of its own </p><p>people, which translates into benefiting one of every five </p><p>Africans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since the 1999 return of civilian government, the </p><p>U.S.-Nigerian bilateral relationship has been a productive </p><p>one.  Nigeria has promoted democratization and taken an </p><p>active role in conflict resolution in countries such as </p><p>Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, Cote d\'Ivoire, The </p><p>Congo, Burundi and Sudan.  Additionally, Nigeria has taken a </p><p>constructive position on important transnational issues such </p><p>as counter-narcotics and HIV/AIDS.  Since September 11, </p><p>Nigeria has voiced strong public support for U.S. operations </p><p>in Afghanistan and has been at the forefront of African </p><p>counter-terrorism efforts.  Nigeria has become an important </p><p>ally for America on many issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, Nigeria\'s democratic transition is not complete. </p><p>The electoral process is unsettled and susceptible to </p><p>violence.  Communal violence and tensions have threatened </p><p>internal security in many areas.  At the root of many of </p><p>these outbreaks are poverty and unemployment.  Despite some </p><p>reforms such as progress on privatization, the non-oil </p><p>economy is not robust and has not produced the job and income </p><p>opportunities many had expected.  Too many Nigerians still </p><p>await their democracy dividend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The over-arching U.S. goal in Nigeria is to help protect the </p><p>country\'s long-term internal stability by promoting democracy </p><p>and sound economic reforms.  A vibrant democracy devoted to </p><p>good governance and the rule of law will advance U.S. goals </p><p>here and throughout the continent.   Direct investment in the </p><p>non-oil sector is an essential component for job creation, </p><p>poverty reduction and thus, political stability.  The U.S. </p><p>can help Nigeria lower the barriers for those who wish to </p><p>play a productive role in the national economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Given Nigeria\'s pro-western leaning and its visible public </p><p>support for our counter-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan, we </p><p>should provide significant support to Nigerian </p><p>democratization, stability  and economic development. </p><p>Provision of FY 2002 ESF will show that the U.S. has not </p><p>forgotten Africa and that close African partners, such as </p><p>Nigeria, can derive concrete, tangible benefit from aligning </p><p>their interests with ours. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Policy Objectives and National Interests </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Strengthening democracy is critical to the long-term </p><p>stability of Nigeria. Democratic governance safeguards human </p><p>rights and promotes the rule of law. It provides a conducive </p><p>environment for private investment and economic growth, and </p><p>helps position Nigeria to sustain a constructive role beyond </p><p>its border.  A democratic Nigeria portends increasingly </p><p>closer bilateral relations and enhanced cooperation on </p><p>regional security, counter-terrorism, and international law </p><p>enforcement and other important USG interests.  America\'s </p><p>interests benefit if Nigerian democracy succeeds. A deciding </p><p>factor will be the quality of the 2003 elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 2003 elections present both a challenge and an </p><p>opportunity for Nigeria\'s democratic effort. With elections </p><p>less than two years away, the informal campaign already has </p><p>begun.  The campaigning is intense and not always positive. </p><p>Without well-placed electoral assistance, 2003 could repeat </p><p>the irregularities that plagued the 1999 exercise, causing </p><p>many observers to deem them flawed.  Potential obstacles </p><p>include inadequate election administration, insufficient </p><p>civic participation and widespread cynicism born of political </p><p>corruption.  Moreover, the risk of electoral violence is high </p><p>and could mar the process.  What happens during the lead-up </p><p>to election, especially voter registration, will be as </p><p>critical as the balloting itself.  It is important that the </p><p>entire electoral process be viewed by most Nigerians as a </p><p>transparent, democratic improvement over the 1999 exercise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition to ensuring credible elections, concerns </p><p>regarding federalism and decentralization need to be resolved </p><p>in a way that promotes good governance and a tolerant </p><p>political culture.  New relationships need to be forged among </p><p>the different levels of government and between government and </p><p>civil society in order to deal more effectively with the </p><p>issues of democracy and governance. Also, Nigeria\'s police </p><p>force needs to be capable of providing the security essential </p><p>to political stability, while being cognizant of the rule of </p><p>law and human rights considerations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. Elections Assistance:                  Total $7.15 million </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ESF can help move Nigeria toward successful elections.  The </p><p>USG already has committed $2 million in FY-2001 ESF to </p><p>support the administration of elections. These funds provide </p><p>technical assistance through December 2002 to Nigeria\'s </p><p>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and to State </p><p>Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs) for elections </p><p>administration training.  While FY-2001 funding is an </p><p>important initial contribution, a wide range of assistance is </p><p>still needed to ensure the coming elections are conducted </p><p>properly and to integrate non-partisan elections </p><p>administration into the matrix of Nigeria\'s political process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>International standards would call for an expenditure of at </p><p>least 60 million to fund elections preparations in Nigeria </p><p>(one dollar per estimated voter.)  However, INEC was only </p><p>allocated $12 million so far (The remaining $25 million of </p><p>the FY-2002 INEC budget was reserved for infrastructure </p><p>improvements that may be needed by INEC but do not directly </p><p>prepare its staff for the actual administration and conduct </p><p>of elections nor enhance the electoral process.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Clearly, there is a budgetary shortfall. The proposed $7.15 </p><p>million in FY2002 ESF would help reduce the deficit.  The </p><p>Mission has established an Inter-Agency Elections Working </p><p>Group, and in close coordination with other donors, will </p><p>implement the following assistance: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. Consolidating INEC Election Administration and Capacity </p><p>Building. FY-2001 ESF funded voter registration database </p><p>development and training in logistics management.  However, </p><p>INEC\'s technical capacity, while improved, remains limited </p><p>and will be seriously tested during the 2002-2003 elections. </p><p>The USG is well positioned to provide technical assistance </p><p>due to the strong relationship between INEC and the </p><p>International Foundation for Elections Systems (IFES), a key </p><p>USAID partner.  FY 2002 ESF will fund the continuous </p><p>presence, through December 2003, of IFES\'s </p><p>internationally-recognized senior elections administration </p><p>advisor, as well as numerous training events and consultants </p><p>in specific areas of electoral administration and electoral </p><p>law reform.  The senior advisor has already played an </p><p>invaluable role by providing guidance on international </p><p>electoral standards, INEC\'s budget submissions, conflict </p><p>management, and development of a code of conduct for </p><p>political parties.  A major focus of the additional (FY 2002) </p><p> technical assistance will be monitoring implementation of </p><p>logistics plans for the 2003 elections.  ESF assistance will </p><p>establish post-election mechanisms to evaluate INEC\'s </p><p>performance and to begin strategic planning for the 2007 </p><p>elections. An aim of that strategic review would be to ensure </p><p>that elections planning becomes an integral part of normal </p><p>government operations. ($2.7 million) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. INEC Polling Station Officers Training.  FY-2002 ESF will </p><p>fund IFES preparation of a manual for the 120,000 polling </p><p>station officers who will oversee the actual voting </p><p>throughout the country, and train INEC staff to conduct </p><p>orientation workshops for these officers.  These polling </p><p>station officers are temporary employees engaged shortly </p><p>before the elections.  Basic orientation on policies and </p><p>procedures is needed for them to perform their critical task </p><p>of ensuring that voting at their stations is conducted </p><p>properly and fairly.  Given the shortage of INEC resources, </p><p>the quality of training will be inadequate unless outside </p><p>assistance is provided.  IFES has already evaluated INEC\'s </p><p>training resources and created a training plan by which INEC </p><p>will fund the attendance of the trainees, while IFES provides </p><p>training materials and workshop oversight.  ($700,000) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Party Poll Agents Training:  Each candidate and party is </p><p>permitted to have a representative at each polling station. </p><p>Party-affiliated observers, as well as independent observers, </p><p>are critical to keep irregularities and, thus, potentially </p><p>violent protests to a minimum.  However, party observers can </p><p>add confusion if misinformed about electoral procedures. </p><p>This program element will provide manuals, </p><p>training-of-trainers, and overall coordination among the </p><p>political parties to train up to 500,000-600,000 party </p><p>agents. The International Republic Institute (IRI) will </p><p>implement this program.  IRI has established relationships </p><p>with Nigerian political parties over the past two years </p><p>through its work on grassroots organizational development and </p><p>promoting women\'s participation in political parties.  ($1.25 </p><p>million) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. Civil society and media campaigns to promote participation </p><p>and non-violence: Civil society and media activities must be </p><p>intensified for the 2003 elections.  This program utilizes </p><p>Nigerian NGOs to promote civic awareness, greater public </p><p>participation in the pre-elections phase and higher voter </p><p>turnout. The other component of the program will be to </p><p>discourage the violence that has often discredited elections </p><p>in Nigeria.  The project will create mechanisms to mediate </p><p>conflict and disseminate non-violence and voter education </p><p>messages.  The program will be administered through a </p><p>pre-existing USAID civil society assistance program. </p><p>Individual NGOs will be selected through a proposal process </p><p>coordinated with the Transition Monitoring Group, a Nigerian </p><p>NGO coalition. ($1.3 million) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. U.S. Election Observers:  USAID will use FY-2002 ESF to </p><p>support a team of high-level election monitors from the </p><p>United States, as was done for the 1999 elections.  Funds </p><p>will be provided to one or more U.S. institutions (IFES, NDI, </p><p>Carter Center, IRI) to field an observation team.  Details of </p><p>this activity will be developed as interested organizations </p><p>are identified. ($400,000) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. Media Training:  Training would be provided to media </p><p>practitioners on elections procedures, ways of using and </p><p>analyzing voting data, and standards of professionalism for </p><p>media coverage of the elections.  To be implemented through </p><p>IFES and USAID\'s civil society assistance program. ($300,000) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. Elections Tribunals Assistance:  FY-2002 ESF will provide </p><p>basic orientation on the new electoral law and on </p><p>international standards for election tribunal judges.  The </p><p>program will also include a public education campaign about </p><p>the tribunals. Building effective tribunals promotes the rule </p><p>of law and peaceful resolution of elections disputes, </p><p>reducing the chance of election-related violence and </p><p>instability.  The judges will be trained on the new electoral </p><p>law, given an orientation on elections procedures, and </p><p>provided access to relevant legal precedents from other </p><p>countries.  This program would be implemented through a </p><p>pre-existing USAID assistance project that works with several </p><p>high courts and the National Judicial Institute of Nigeria </p><p>and includes grants to local NGOs for public education. </p><p>($400,000) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>II.   Nigerian Governors\' Forum:                      $850,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Governors are becoming important political players in </p><p>Nigeria; they control significant resources and have </p><p>established themselves as major decision-makers and agents of </p><p>influence.  Their political capacity has been visible in </p><p>recent debates over the electoral law and resource allocation </p><p>(oil revenue) between state and federal governments. </p><p>Collectively, governors will play a large role in shaping </p><p>Nigerian federalism and in determining whether devolution </p><p>will advance genuine democratization and good governance.  As </p><p>more resources are decentralized, the governors will need </p><p>expertise and technical assistance on financial and budgetary </p><p>management, federalism, economic policy, social services </p><p>administration, and other key issues of governance.  Improved </p><p>inter-governmental relationships are needed to facilitate </p><p>federal-state coordination of fiscal policy, environmental </p><p>policy, investment incentives and other issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Using FY-2002 ESF to support the Nigerian Governors Forum </p><p>will give the USG influence and access to key governors while </p><p>promoting federalism and viable decentralization of power and </p><p>resources. Support to the Forum will be in the form of </p><p>limited technical assistance and equipment to establish a </p><p>secretariat in Abuja and to assist in developing an action </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>plan to engage different levels of government on policy </p><p>issues key to decentralization, economic development and </p><p>investment. The federal-state dialogue will be helped by </p><p>providing the Federal Government a single entity with which </p><p>to confer on those issues common to the states.  The project </p><p>will also focus on a long-term plan to sustain the </p><p>organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USAID, through its implementing partner, the National </p><p>Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI), has an </p><p>established relationship with the Governors\' Forum that dates </p><p>back to the election in 1999.  Because NDI is established in </p><p>Nigeria, assisting the Forum will be cost-effective and will </p><p>not require start-up administrative costs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>III. Labor Union Strengthening:                  $1,500,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Labor unions represent the largest organized section of </p><p>Nigeria\'s civil society.  Although weakened by years of </p><p>military rule, labor can bring the nation to a standstill by </p><p>go slows or a general strike and can block important economic </p><p>reform.  Moreover, labor is important to the Nigerian oil </p><p>sector and American economic interests in that sector, as </p><p>well as the stability of the environment in which American </p><p>companies operate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Current funding touches a wide spectrum of Nigerian </p><p>institutions but does not engage labor.  Because of our lack </p><p>of contact, we have little access and influence with the </p><p>labor movement. Insufficient contact with the international </p><p>community diminishes labor\'s perceptions of the market </p><p>economy. Too often, Nigerian labor groups embrace statist </p><p>platforms that might have had utility during military rule </p><p>but now serve to retard reform, growth and good governance. </p><p>We must incorporate labor into our plans for economic and </p><p>political reform.  If we can influence labor and enhance its </p><p>understanding and support for reform, labor can become a </p><p>voice for democratization and economic reform instead of a </p><p>brake on these objectives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We can influence labor leadership through a project designed </p><p>to bolster the internal administration of labor organizations </p><p>as well as to augment labor\'s understanding of political and </p><p>economic democratization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Major recipients of training and other capacity-building </p><p>activities will be the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) and the </p><p>Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUCN-formerly the Senior </p><p>Staff Consultative Association of Nigeria).  These are the </p><p>two main national trade union umbrella organizations (NLC for </p><p>blue-collar workers and TUCN for white-collar workers). </p><p>Sector-specific unions in the oil and gas industry will also </p><p>be engaged.  The program will target leaders at the state and </p><p>national level for over two years.  Two-years are needed to </p><p>implement a program and is the critical period during which </p><p>labor must be convinced to play a constructive role in the </p><p>electoral process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Activities will include basic training in economic policy for </p><p>national and state-level leaders, basic organizational and </p><p>management training, and the provision of training materials </p><p>and basic communication and information technology at several </p><p>organizational levels.  After the abuses of the previous </p><p>government, there is a serious need to rebuild a leadership </p><p>cadre attuned to the nuances of economic policy as well as </p><p>the requirements of political participation in a democracy. </p><p>Additionally, women leaders will be targeted to increase </p><p>their leadership skills and improve overall representation of </p><p>women in the male-dominated labor union leadership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This program will be implemented through a cooperative </p><p>agreement between USAID and the AFL-CIO\'S Center for </p><p>International Labor Solidarity, which has had an ongoing </p><p>relationship with the NLC and TUCN for more than 30 years, </p><p>despite the difficulties imposed by sustained military rule. </p><p> This history makes it possible for the Solidarity Center to </p><p>build an extensive program of training for the newly </p><p>revitalized unions, and the proposed program has been </p><p>developed in direct collaboration between the Solidarity </p><p>Center and the two Nigerian labor centers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IV. Addressing the Trafficking in Persons (TIP):  $500,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The illegal trafficking in persons is a growing concern in </p><p>Nigeria.  While economic conditions factor heavily in the </p><p>problem, trafficking and its resultant servitude is a grave </p><p>violation of human rights. Such a practice undermines </p><p>democracy, the rule of law and the legitimate economy. </p><p>Moreover, it promotes criminality and disregard for </p><p>individual rights, particularly those of society\'s most </p><p>vulnerable members. As such, it is a source of both injustice </p><p>and instability. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This important program will be implemented by INL through an </p><p>international organization already working in this field, </p><p>such as UNICEF, IOM or ILO-IPEC.  The GON recently created an </p><p>inter-agency committee to better coordinate federal </p><p>assistance to victims of trafficking rescued overseas and </p><p>repatriated to Nigeria.  ESF funds will assist the committee </p><p>in building a nation-wide structure for short-term care and </p><p>long-term vocational training of trafficked victims in order </p><p>to minimize recidivism.   Most assistance will be used to </p><p>defray non-recurring start-up costs of establishing shelters </p><p>and training centers.   This will complement: 1) the </p><p>ILO-IPEC\'s new project ($300,000 of USDOL funds) to assist </p><p>the GON establish a National Plan of Action Against </p><p>Trafficking of Persons and expanding awareness programs among </p><p>at-risk populations; 2) the IOM\'s new $2.1 million project to </p><p>assist the repatriation of trafficking victims and train law </p><p>enforcement personnel; and 3) an INL project to equip and </p><p>train the small Nigerian </p><p>Police Anti-Trafficking Task Force based in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>V. Police Modernization:                   $2.0 million </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Years of neglect during military rule left the police force </p><p>demoralized, understaffed and under-equipped.  The force as </p><p>now constituted is unable to fulfill its mandate under a </p><p>civilian government.  The police\'s failure to contain several </p><p>instances of communal violence demonstrates its institutional </p><p>and operational inadequacies, despite the current political </p><p>will within Nigeria to develop a professional force. </p><p>Moreover, too many police officers are not familiar with </p><p>criminal procedure, modern investigative techniques, </p><p>community liaison and human rights.  To promote the rule of </p><p>law and engender that sense of security needed for a </p><p>democracy to function, the police needs to be modernized.  A </p><p>more professional police force would have the salutary effect </p><p>of reducing the military\'s role in internal security and law </p><p>enforcement, a role that inevitably leads to serious </p><p>violations of human rights. A needed initial step in this </p><p>overall effort is to improve the police force\'s central </p><p>administration. To do its job on the </p><p> streets better, the force must first improve the way it </p><p>manages itself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This program will be implemented by INL.   Building on modest </p><p>activities begun with FY01 ESF, this project will seek to </p><p>strengthen management and administration of the Nigerian </p><p>Police Force through technical assistance ($1.25 million) and </p><p>the continued provision of organizational management training </p><p>for senior -level Nigerian Police Force managers ($750,000). </p><p>Implemented through a contractor with experience in both </p><p>organizational management and law enforcement, the project </p><p>will provide technical assistance in the form of repeated </p><p>visits by two or three short-term (60 days) advisors who will </p><p>review the NPF\'s management system and administrative </p><p>structure.  With the agreement of NPF managers, the technical </p><p>advisors will help the Inspector General of Police and his </p><p>staff implement new procedures to increase transparency, </p><p>improve budgetary planning and allocations, encourage the </p><p>delegation of authority and feedback from subordinate </p><p>officers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The training will be implemented by the same contractor </p><p>already working closely with the U.K. DFID "Accessible </p><p>Justice" program of assistance to the police and judiciary. </p><p>The training in advanced organizational management techniques </p><p>will seek to familiarize senior police officials with </p><p>management techniques that have proven successful for large </p><p>companies in the business and corporate world and would not </p><p>cover police operational matters (thus ESF could be used to </p><p>for this project). Several one or two week sessions of this </p><p>course will be offered at the NPF Jos Staff College. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Overall, this project will build on a joint AID-INL effort </p><p>with FY01 funds (both ESF and INC) to create an </p><p>administrative and criminal database to manage human and </p><p>material resources as well as criminal cases.  As such, this </p><p>initiates a new phase in the USG\'s long-term police </p><p>modernization program in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corporate Responsibility Initiative </p><p>(The Niger Delta - South) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Policy Objectives and National Interests </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This initiative is concentrated in the Delta region. </p><p>Promoting public/private partnerships in that area and </p><p>facilitating collaboration between the oil companies, state </p><p>governments, and local communities furthers U.S. interests in </p><p>democracy, governance, economic trade, and development.  The </p><p>Delta is an important source of the fossil fuel needed to run </p><p>the U.S. economy, yet it is also an economically deprived, </p><p>politically tense and environmentally challenged region. </p><p>Social unrest and violent outbreaks happen frequently.  Many </p><p>local inhabitants blame oil companies, including U.S. </p><p>entities, for this depressed situation.  As elections draw </p><p>near, the political heat in the Delta will likely rise due to </p><p>this perceived inequality.  U.S. interests lie in creating a </p><p>secure environment where oil companies can operate safely and </p><p>the supply of fuel to U.S. markets is not interrupted.  Our </p><p>interests are best served when local communities feel they </p><p>derive some benefit from the operation of U.S.-based </p><p>companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A project that requires the cooperative efforts of state </p><p>governments, NGOs and the oil companies will reduce political </p><p>tension and conflict in the area.  This also will help reduce </p><p>the prospect of electoral violence in the region. </p><p>Additionally, the initiative will promote human rights and </p><p>the rule of law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For local inhabitants, U.S. companies in the Delta represent </p><p>the United States more so than the Embassy.  By encouraging </p><p>corporate responsibility and best practices in the area, we </p><p>improve the image of these companies and, by extension, </p><p>improve perceptions of the U.S. among the people of the Delta </p><p>and in Nigeria overall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The upstream oil industry provides 90 percent of total export </p><p>earnings, and, as such, is a major determinant of the </p><p>political and economic situation in Nigeria.  Although </p><p>two-thirds of Nigeria\'s oil comes from the Delta, the region </p><p>remains one of the least developed parts of the country, with </p><p>poor roads, few clinics and schools, plus an enormous </p><p>environmental problem.  Pipe-borne water comes only to the </p><p>most privileged homes.  Water and soil pollution are serious </p><p>concerns -- traditional livelihoods in farming and fishing </p><p>are jeopardized in some areas.  Reports of widespread </p><p>pollution, coupled with the execution of the Delta\'s leading </p><p>environmental activist, sparked international criticism of </p><p>the former military regime but also drew attention to the </p><p>conduct of oil companies, particularly Shell, but also </p><p>American concerns such as Chevron, Mobil, Texaco and Ashland. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Equitable distribution of the country\'s US$10 billion annual </p><p>oil revenues and the environmental and social (corporate) </p><p>responsibilities of the oil multinationals are issues to be </p><p>resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At current rates of production, it is estimated that </p><p>Nigeria\'s oil reserves will be exhausted in less than 30 </p><p>years.  The Government therefore sees the need to diversify </p><p>and broaden the country\'s revenue base.  One of these areas </p><p>is to exploit the vast reserves of natural gas, which </p><p>constitute the eighth largest in the world. U.S. companies, </p><p>by engaging in good community relations and having </p><p>cooperative relations with government, can position </p><p>themselves to tap into this vast supply. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, oil or gas extraction companies will continue to </p><p>attract political criticism and be the target of occasional </p><p>unrest if the lives of residents of affected areas are not </p><p>improved.  This project proposal will be an important initial </p><p>step toward defusing a volatile, potentially destabilizing </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Proposed FY 2002 ESF Program </p><p>The Niger Delta (Southern Nigeria) </p><p>$5,000,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy will foster cooperation among state governments, </p><p>local communities, the Niger Delta Development Commission </p><p>(NDDC), NGOs and oil companies.  The project will provide </p><p>technical and policy assistance to state governments and the </p><p>NDDC on governance and development.  It will support the </p><p>establishment and operations of conflict resolution and other </p><p>mechanisms that promote dialogue. This program aspect </p><p>involves the states and NDDC, but equally important, it </p><p>includes NGOs, local communities and oil companies.  With </p><p>specific regard to the oil companies, the project will </p><p>encourage implementation of the Voluntary Principles on Human </p><p>Rights and Security while also promoting corporate </p><p>responsibility best practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another focus of the project will be working with states in </p><p>the Delta that do not have strategic investment plans.  The </p><p>initiative will help develop these plans. After the plans are </p><p>created, a portion of program funds will be utilized to help </p><p>attract investment and funding from domestic and </p><p>international sources for the implementation of the plans. </p><p>The program likewise will help states with existing </p><p>investment plans identify internal and external sources for </p><p>specific investments. This segment of the program will be </p><p>designed to involve governments, local communities, NGOs and </p><p>the private sector in identifying priority economic and </p><p>social development needs and developing a strategic framework </p><p>that responds to these needs. The plans, when implemented, </p><p>will increase employment, enhance the agricultural sector, </p><p>and strengthen workforce productivity through skill </p><p>development. These positive changes, in turn, will improve </p><p>the security landscape and prospects for stability and </p><p>democratization. A key element of this </p><p>ESF activity will be identifying employment possibilities for </p><p>unemployed youth in agro-processing and other income </p><p>generating activities.  Providing employment opportunities </p><p>for youth is key to the political and social stability in the </p><p>Delta. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USAID will have overall management responsibility for the </p><p>activity.  In that case, USAID will prepare a competitive </p><p>solicitation for a U.S. contractor or grantee to undertake </p><p>the activities described above.  The successful U.S. </p><p>contractor/grantee will be required to work collaboratively </p><p>with local communities and the oil companies, as well as </p><p>provide grants to community organizations.  USAID will work </p><p>closely with the corporate responsibility staff at the </p><p>Embassy to implement this activity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Public Private Partnership Initiative </p><p> (Northern Nigeria) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Policy Objectives and National Interests </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Major urban areas in the predominantly Muslim North -- Kano, </p><p>Kaduna and Jos -- have experienced increasingly violent </p><p>communal conflicts. Other Northern areas are potential hot </p><p>spots.  Many of these outbreaks have ethnic and religious </p><p>overtones but unemployment and poverty are the root causes of </p><p>these developments.  A mis-directed competition for scarce </p><p>resources has produced violence not opportunity. Too many </p><p>people have no jobs and little future prospects.  This makes </p><p>a segment of the population, particularly the young urban </p><p>underclass, susceptible to violence, radical solutions to </p><p>their problems and political manipulation. Many of them see </p><p>modernity as pitted against them.  The number of people in </p><p>this category makes this both an economic concern as well as </p><p>a challenge to political stability in key Northern areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By working to develop agriculture and other labor-intensive </p><p>industries, we reduce the dry tinder that sparks unrest and </p><p>advance the U.S. objective of political stability.  Moreover, </p><p>active and visible engagement in economic development will </p><p>counter the widespread perception that the USG is anti-Muslim </p><p>and anti-North.  This will help mute anti-democratic and </p><p>anti-West voices in this region of the country.  In light of </p><p>September 11 and the criticism of US military action in </p><p>Afghanistan that came from parts of Northern Nigeria, this </p><p>project could not be more timely.  With Nigeria having the </p><p>largest Muslim population in Africa, the poverty and </p><p>deprivation in the North could become an invitation for </p><p>Islamic radicalization inimical to U.S. interests in Nigeria </p><p>and beyond. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Proposed FY 2002 ESF Program </p><p>Public-Private Partnership in Northern Nigeria  $5,000,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The same approach of partnering with the private sector and </p><p>government in the Niger Delta can be applied to northern </p><p>Nigeria. Public-Private Partnerships will help boost exports </p><p>and expand employment opportunities, particularly in the </p><p>agricultural sector. The program objective is to facilitate </p><p>domestic, U.S. and third country investment in northern </p><p>Nigeria\'s agribusiness and its not insignificant but </p><p>under-utilized industrial base.  By helping to lay the </p><p>groundwork for investment, the program will contribute to </p><p>capacity-building in policy, technological know-how and </p><p>agriculture grades, standards and regulations.  Export crops </p><p>such as ginger and cotton will be considered for investment </p><p>partnerships, although the final selection will be based on </p><p>the ongoing survey of agricultural competitiveness. The </p><p>garment industry and leather works, including </p><p>shoe-manufacturing, are other areas of possible attraction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another partnership proposal involves establishing an </p><p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Center in one </p><p>of the northern states.  Demand for the ICT will grow as a </p><p>result of other USAID initiatives in agriculture, small and </p><p>medium enterprise (SME) development and environmental </p><p>protection.  The ICT will assist in implementing best </p><p>practices and facilitating the flow of information among </p><p>partners.  Partnerships are envisaged under this component </p><p>with the Virtual University, State Governments and </p><p>institutions of higher learning in the North.  Funding will </p><p>be leveraged with other public and private sources; the state </p><p>chosen would be expected to allocate a building for this </p><p>activity.  This prototype, if successful, could be duplicated </p><p>by other states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USAID/NIGERIA will prepare a competitive solicitation for the </p><p>        U.S. contractor or grantee to undertake the </p><p>activities described above. The contractor/grantee will be </p><p>required to work with local communities and the private </p><p>sector as well as provide small grants to community </p><p>organizations </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anti-Corruption Program in Nigeria </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Policy Objectives and National Interests </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Direct investment in non-oil sectors is key to job creation, </p><p>poverty reduction and ultimately to political stability. </p><p>However, the current environment of corruption and lack of </p><p>transparency deter U.S. investors in these sectors.  To </p><p>promote U.S. investment in Nigeria, we need to help Nigeria </p><p>level the playing field for participants in the economy. </p><p>Part of this effort will include building capacity to fight </p><p>transnational crime, including money laundering, in support </p><p>of post-September 11 U.S. priorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corruption permeates all levels of Nigerian society. </p><p>Governmental corruption impedes transparency, retards </p><p>efficient deliver of public services and undermines </p><p>confidence in democracy. Cognizant  of these problems, </p><p>President Obasanjo has demonstrated commitment to combating </p><p>public sector corruption through the establishment of the </p><p>Anti-Corruption Commission and the Independent Corrupt </p><p>Practices and Other Offences Commission (ICPC) as well as the </p><p>institution of value-for-money audits and due process for all </p><p>federal government capital expenditures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USAID is currently funding, in collaboration with the World </p><p>Bank, a comprehensive survey, which will provide detailed </p><p>information on corruption in the country.  This information </p><p>will be used to educate and inform federal, state and local </p><p>governments, as well as civil society in an effort to build a </p><p>constituency to combat corrupt misconduct. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Proposed FY 2002 ESF Program </p><p>Anti-Corruption Projects </p><p>$1.0 million </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. Public Sector Audit and Oversight: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Based on analysis of other donor activity and an assessment </p><p>of institutional comparative advantages, the U.S. Mission </p><p>recommends a series of initiatives over the short- and </p><p>long-term that build on ongoing efforts.   Project activities </p><p>will lie mainly in three areas: a) public sector assessment </p><p>and training for internal auditing and oversight; b) ethics </p><p>in public service; and c) promotion of civil society </p><p>involvement in anti-corruption efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>      Casals and Associates, an U.S. contractor, will carry </p><p>out this work.  They are presently implementing the USAID/WB </p><p>Corruption survey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Independent Corrupt Practices Commission: $500,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This one-year project will assist the ICPC strengthen its </p><p>investigating and prosecutorial capacities.  The one year-old </p><p>Commission is expanding, has hired staff members, and has </p><p>opened new offices outside Abuja.  Building on an initial </p><p>allotment of $455,000 in FY01 ESF, this project will expand </p><p>technical assistance to the ICPC\'s investigative and </p><p>prosecutorial arms, with the objective of boosting the </p><p>Commission\'s capacity to combat high-level corruption. </p><p>Through a study of improved internal procedures and </p><p>regulations and an exchange with officials from successful </p><p>anti-Corruption agencies in Hong Kong and Singapore, this </p><p>project will augment the Commission institutionally.   A </p><p>substantial portion of this project will provide training in </p><p>Nigeria for newly hired ICPC investigators and prosecutors. </p><p>Some ICPC managers will be given advanced training </p><p>opportunities in the United States.   Provision of basic </p><p>investigative equipment - such as digital recording devices </p><p>and computers - will be included. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Department of Justice\'s Overseas Prosecutorial </p><p>Development and Training (OPDAT) program and the Department </p><p>of Treasury\'s Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) will </p><p>implement this jointly.  INL\'s Regional Narcotics and Law </p><p>Enforcement Office (RNLEO) in Nigeria will monitor and report </p><p>on the project\'s effectiveness. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH </p><p>Strengthening Economic Policy Making </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Policy Objectives and National Interests </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Open markets and increased U.S. investment will spur economic </p><p>development and help sustain democratic progress, foster </p><p>expanded trade, and foster a healthier economy which, in </p><p>turn, helps safeguard essential U.S. energy interests in </p><p>Nigeria. Mission goals are to strengthen the institutional </p><p>capacity of the Nigerian Government to plan and implement </p><p>economic reform, repair mismanaged institutions, and promote </p><p>prudent fiscal and monetary policy, with the cooperation of </p><p>the international financial institutions and donor community. </p><p>This will bolster Nigeria\'s macro-economic situation and </p><p>promote political stability. It will also enhance Nigeria\'s </p><p>role as a catalyst for growth in the West African sub-region. </p><p>Moreover, neighboring states will be further encouraged </p><p>toward economic reform if an economy as vast as Nigeria\'s can </p><p>be reshaped and energized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria is undergoing the slow process of economic and </p><p>structural reforms. Privatization, deregulation, </p><p>diversification away from hydrocarbons and improvement of the </p><p>overall legal and regulatory environment governing foreign </p><p>investment are key issues.  As part of the reform agenda, </p><p>Nigeria is developing a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper </p><p>(PRSP) in cooperation with the international donor community, </p><p>and as a condition of its engagement with the IMF.  The PRSP </p><p>will enable Nigeria to rationalize resource allocation and </p><p>establish priorities for long-term development.  However, the </p><p>GON lacks the capacity to collect and analyze data needed to </p><p>develop this strategy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Current USAID programs support the national privatization </p><p>program and economic policy coordination through direct aid </p><p>to the Bureau for Public Enterprises and the Economic Policy </p><p>Coordinating Committee, respectively.  USAID has also </p><p>contributed to an assessment of tariff policy and structure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Proposed FY 2002 ESF Program </p><p>Strengthening Economic Management         $1,500,000 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Government of Nigeria (GON) needs to establish its broad </p><p>direction for policy, complemented by the development of </p><p>sectoral and multi-sectoral strategies.  The recent expiry of </p><p>the IMF Stand-By Arrangement was partly because no office in </p><p>the GON was tasked with tracking compliance with IMF targets. </p><p>The recently appointed Chief Economic Advisor now has been </p><p>tasked with this responsibility and has requested assistance </p><p>in building a team of well-trained economists able to collect </p><p>and analyze data and write strategy and policy papers on </p><p>reform.  In coordination with other donors, we will assess </p><p>the utility of supplying equipment such as computers, </p><p>software and internet access to the Federal Office of </p><p>Statistics, which falls under the purview of the Chief </p><p>Economic Advisor.  Much of the training can be conducted </p><p>through Nigerian universities and institutes at very </p><p>competitive costs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With more capacity, the Office of the Chief Economic Advisor </p><p>can play a key role in: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Advocating the reduction of barriers that inhibit free and </p><p>fair trade. </p><p>--Arguing for enhanced intellectual property rights </p><p>protection. </p><p>--Urging the growth of the non-hydrocarbon export sector, to </p><p>take advantage of Nigeria\'s vast mineral and human resources, </p><p>and to tap into the benefits offered by the Africa Growth and </p><p>Opportunity Act (AGOA). </p><p>--Seeking compliance with the IMF\'s informal program. </p><p>--Developing Nigeria\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. </p><p>--Achieving macroeconomic stability, through economic and </p><p>structural reforms, enabling U.S. direct investment. </p><p>--Restructuring the Joint Economic Partnership Committee </p><p>(JEPC) as a mechanism to promote economic reform and </p><p>liberalization of trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USAID/Nigeria will prepare a competitive solicitation for a </p><p>U.S. contractor or grantee to undertake the activities </p><p>described above.  The successful U.S. contractor/grantee will </p><p>be required to work collaboratively with the GON, state and </p><p>local governments and the private sector. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
