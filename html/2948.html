<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002414 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, JO, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT: WHA: JORDAN OPPOSES POLITICIZATION OF WHA, WILL </p><p>LOOK AT TEXT OF RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 92449 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  PolCouns covered ref points on the morning of May 15 </p><p>with Ali al-Ayed of Foreign Minister Muasher\'s personal </p><p>office, urging Jordan to vote no on the proposed WHA draft </p><p>resolution on health conditions in the Occupied Territories. </p><p>PolCouns noted that quick action was required, since the </p><p>resolution could come up for consideration as early as the </p><p>afternoon of May 15.  He also urged Jordan to oppose any </p><p>attempt to modify the credentials of Israel\'s delegation to </p><p>the WHA.  Ayed said he would pass U.S. concerns immediately </p><p>to FonMin Muasher. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  In a subsequent conversation May 15, Ayed said he </p><p>had conferred with FonMin Muasher.  Neither were aware of any </p><p>effort to introduce a resolution on health in the Occupied </p><p>Territories or alter Israeli credentials.  Ayed said Jordan </p><p>agrees that the WHO and other specialized international </p><p>bodies should not be politicized, and that Jordan would </p><p>likely oppose an attempt to change Israeli credentials. </p><p>However, Jordan would look at the actual text of an Occupied </p><p>Territories resolution and the political (as opposed to </p><p>health) content of the resolution before determining whether </p><p>to support it, reject it, or abstain.  PolCouns urged that </p><p>Jordan, at a minimum, abstain on any such resolution. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
