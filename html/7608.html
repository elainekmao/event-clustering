<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000739 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S MAOIST LEADERS RETURN TO INFLEXIBLE STANCE </p><p>ON CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 723 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 652 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 675 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert K. Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary:  In an April 22 mass meeting held in </p><p>southwestern Nepal, Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai </p><p>reportedly stated that the "introductory round" of peace </p><p>talks originally scheduled for April 21 was postponed (ref A) </p><p>due to ambiguity in the government\'s stand on the "political </p><p>agenda" of the talks (i.e. the question of a constituent </p><p>assembly.)  Variously calling on King Gyanendra to clarify </p><p>the Government of Nepal (GON)\'s position or take part in the </p><p>talks personally, he reiterated the Maoist commitment to a </p><p>constituent assembly.  Bhattarai\'s speech, peppered with </p><p>belligerent rhetoric, echoed similar comments made in an </p><p>April 21 press release by Maoist leader Prachanda.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Speaking to a public gathering in the southwestern </p><p>district of Kailali on April 22, Maoist leader Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai reportedly claimed that his negotiating team </p><p>postponed peace talks scheduled for the previous day (ref A) </p><p>because the GON had not taken a clear position on the issue </p><p>of a constituent assembly.  Stating that "the King has been </p><p>sending contradictory messages," Bhattarai insisted that "if </p><p>the King is really honest about peace, he should come up with </p><p>a clear political agenda."  Newspaper reports of the speech </p><p>were contradictory, with some claiming that Bhattarai said </p><p>the Maoists "surfaced in the public to hold direct talks with </p><p>the King," and other reports quoting him as saying the </p><p>Maoists would meet with the King\'s emissaries. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Bhattarai also told the crowd, which reports </p><p>estimated at approximately 30,000, that the Maoists would not </p><p>abandon their basic demands.  "There is no alternative to the </p><p>requirement of a new constitution, which should be built </p><p>through a constituent assembly, followed by a round-table </p><p>conference and an interim government," he reportedly said. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Reports of Bhattarai\'s speech included some examples </p><p>of hyperbolic saber-rattling, including his promise of "a </p><p>decisive war" if the government does not seriously pursue </p><p>peace talks.  "We returned to the peace process not because </p><p>we wanted a safe landing after being defeated or exhausted by </p><p>war," Bhattarai reportedly said, "but because we wanted a </p><p>progressive political outlet."  Stating that the Maoists have </p><p>"thousands of cadre who are ready to lay down their lives," </p><p>as well as "ultramodern rocket launchers," Bhattarai </p><p>proclaimed that "if the state tries to crush (the Maoists), </p><p>we will fight a decisive war to capture power at the center." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Bhattarai\'s comments echoed an April 21 press release </p><p>by Maoist leader Prachanda.  Breaking his month-long silence, </p><p>the Maoist Chairman said that "it is well known that (the </p><p>Maoists) are moving responsibly forward in the talk process," </p><p>and that the GON "is trying to strengthen its power rather </p><p>than proposing a political solution."   In the April 21 </p><p>release, Prachanda backed away from previous statements made </p><p>by the Maoist negotiating team, which had indicated a </p><p>willingness to work with an all-party government, and </p><p>repeated his demand for a constituent assembly.  "The </p><p>constitution of the past has failed to find a solution to the </p><p>problems facing the people," the statement read. "Therefore </p><p>there is an urgent need to form a new constitution...  The </p><p>assumption of various political parties, including the </p><p>Communist Party - United Marxist Leninist, that only a </p><p>so-called all-party government can... resolve the crisis </p><p>facing the country is an illusion."  Stating that "neither a </p><p>so-called all-party government, nor reinstatement of the old </p><p>parliament, nor reinstatement of the Deuba government" would </p><p>be able to resolve the crisis, Prachanda said that the "real </p><p>political solution can be found only by focusing on the peace </p><p>process and by movement toward building a new constitution </p><p>through a constituent assembly." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment:  Bhattarai\'s statement is clearly offered as </p><p>a pretext for the Maoists\' decision to postpone the opening </p><p>round of talks after publicly lambasting purported delays on </p><p>the part of the GON.  Pinning the delay on the GON\'s failure </p><p>to address the controversial topic of a constituent assembly </p><p>at the first round of negotiations is a flimsy cover for an </p><p>obvious desire on the part of the Maoists to see how </p><p>events--ongoing student unrest (refs A and B) and rumored </p><p>changes in the Cabinet (ref C)--play out.  The Maoists\' </p><p>sudden inflexibility on the issue of a constituent assembly </p><p>raises questions about the motive behind this apparent shift </p><p>in rhetoric.  The Maoists undoubtedly have heard rumors that </p><p>the GON is considering an all-party government, and are </p><p>striving to prevent the parties from joining forces with the </p><p>King.  Post does not see the change as evidence of a split in </p><p>the Maoist ranks, but will continue to monitor the situation </p><p>closely in the coming weeks. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
