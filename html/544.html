ON AUGUST </p><p>31, 1992, SOME TWENTY NON-SERBS (MOSTLY SLOVAKS) </p><p>REPORTEDLY WERE DISMISSED FROM THE ILOK BRICK FACTORY </p><p>AND LOST, ALONG WITH THEIR JOBS, THEIR COMPANY-OWNED </p><p>HOUSING.

IN FACT, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS DIRECTLY FAMILIAR </p><p>WITH DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS, ALMOST ALL THE CASES IN </p><p>THE SERBIAN- CONTROLLED VUKOVAR REGION ARE BROUGHT </p><p>AGAINST CROATS AND OTHER MINORITIES.  A JUDGE AND TWO </p><p>ASSISTANT JUDGES RUN THE PROCEEDINGS.  NEITHER THE </p><p>PROSECUTOR NOR THE SUPPOSED DEFENSE ATTORNEY IS </p><p>ALLOWED TO PLAY A DIRECT ROLE.

IN ONE </p><p>TYPICAL CASE OBSERVED BY AN UNPROFOR CIVILIAN POLICE </p><p>OFFICER, A SIXTY-TWO YEAR OLD CROATIAN WOMAN WAS </p><p>ACCUSED OF HAVING A HANDGRENADE, GUN, AND SHOTGUN IN </p><p>HER HOME.  IN A "QUICKY" TRIAL THE DEFENDANT WAS </p><p>FOUND GUILTY, SENTENCED TO TEN MONTHS IN JAIL, AND </p><p>FINED 6,000 DINARS.

ACCORDING TO UNPROFOR, THE MANY MURDER VICTIMS </p><p>IN THE AREA ARE "INVARIABLY NON-SERBS."
