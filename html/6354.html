Summary: By abandoning a fanciful official exchange </p><p>rate, the GOZ has taken its first baby steps toward </p><p>economic reform.  If serious, its next target should be </p><p>price controls.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Reforms to Date </p><p>--------------- </p><p>2. In past weeks, the GOZ has finally recognized that an </p><p>official rate of Z$ 55:US$ 1 makes little sense.  (The </p><p>market rate is currently 1420:1.)  The hard-line policy </p><p>of last November 14\'s budget announcement nearly </p><p>destroyed export revenue.  Under the new policy, most </p><p>exchanges take place at 824:1 and exporters enjoy a blend </p><p>rate of around 1120:1 (ref a).  As we have reported, the </p><p>GOZ is also bringing tariffs for fuel (ref b) and energy </p><p>(ref c) more in line with their U.S. dollar values. </p><p> </p><p>3. These are positive moves.  However, the Government </p><p>will have to raise prices to a point that does not </p><p>discourage production, especially for net importers, if </p><p>it wants to arrest the country\'s economic demise. </p><p>Controls have meant that retail prices are often a </p><p>fraction of production cost (ref d-e).  Most staples are </p><p>only available on the black market.  Government and </p><p>manufacturers play a continual cat-and-mouse repackaging </p><p>game by alternately enforcing and dodging these </p><p>irrational limits.  Secret service (CIO) agents oversee </p><p>production lines to ensure companies are not selling </p><p>wares at (gasp!) fair market value.  Needless to say, </p><p>this is no way to run a modern economy. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. The business community is visibly relieved by the </p><p>GOZ\'s newfound recognition of market values for exports, </p><p>fuel and energy.  Given that the GOZ was receiving almost </p><p>no export revenue and unable to pay imported fuel and </p><p>energy costs, these were low-risk reforms.  Future </p><p>measures will be more difficult.  Prices and borrowing </p><p>rates will have to rise much faster than wages, making </p><p>Zimbabweans painfully aware of their impoverishment. </p><p> </p><p>5. In addition to relaxing price controls, meaningful </p><p>economic reform would entail reining in money supply, </p><p>allowing interest rates to rise and rebuilding the </p><p>agricultural sector.  Conversion rates into foreign </p><p>exchange would become a measure of productivity rather </p><p>than, at 55:1, an abstraction that obscures Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>economic slide.  Is the Government of Robert Mugabe </p><p>capable of facing this harsh reality, even if the </p><p>alternative is continued double-digit negative growth? </p><p>Hard to say.  But it will be a long journey back to Earth </p><p>for a government that still refuses to acknowledge a </p><p>devaluation by name (approved euphemism is "export </p><p>support mechanism") and blames the economic downturn on </p><p>fabricated trade sanctions (as in the newly-released </p><p>National Economic Revival Program). </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
