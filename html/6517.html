<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000526 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL/AAE, AF/W AND PM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, PGOV, EAID, NI, MMAR </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEETING WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION CHAIRMAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On March 6, Justice Mustapha Akanbi, Chairman of the </p><p>Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offenses </p><p>Commission, (ICPC) paid a courtesy call on Ambassador </p><p>Jeter.  Akanbi thanked the Embassy for supporting the ICPC </p><p>and briefed us on the Senate proceedings underway to amend </p><p>the law that created the ICPC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Justice Akanbi told the Ambassador that the Senate\'s </p><p>effort to weaken the ICPC by legislative amendment was "not </p><p>an unforeseen problem."  He recalled that the legitimacy </p><p>and constitutionality of the Commission were challenged </p><p>when the Commission opened its first investigation against </p><p>a Member of the National Assembly.  The Commission </p><p>encountered numerous obstacles after this investigation was </p><p>launched.  The National Assembly accused the Commissioners </p><p>of being pawns of the Executive Branch and called them to </p><p>account for all of the Commission\'s funds and presented </p><p>other distractions.  Justice Akanbi stated that most </p><p>investigations against National Assembly Members were </p><p>requested by other Assembly Members who presented </p><p>documentary evidence to the Commission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Akanbi contended that the ICPC was not ignoring </p><p>corruption in the Executive Branch.  According to Akanbi, </p><p>investigations have been initiated against at least two </p><p>mid-level officials in the Executive. He challenged the </p><p>Senate to send evidence against any Minister, promising to </p><p>commence an immediate investigation upon receipt of </p><p>credible evidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other </p><p>Offenses Commission (ICPC) Act 2000 was a key weapon in </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s avowed crusade against corruption in </p><p>Nigeria.  Although heavily debated, the Act was eventually </p><p>supported by both houses of the legislature and currently </p><p>enjoys wide public support.  There were credible reports </p><p>that numerous lawmakers accepted payments to secure their </p><p>support for the passage of the Anti-Corruption Bill.  This </p><p>rates as one of the greatest ironies of this lackluster </p><p>legislative session.  Despite these original difficulties, </p><p>the ICPC steadily began to show progress.  However, when it </p><p>opened investigations into House Speaker Na Abba and Senate </p><p>President Anyim, the ICPC provoked the ere of the National </p><p>Assembly leadership.  The Assembly leadership again </p><p>suspected the Commission of doing the bidding of the </p><p>Executive.  (At that time, the Presidency was under an </p><p>impeachment threat)  Consequently, Assembly Members </p><p>proposed an amendment to the ICPC legislation that would </p><p>reduce Executive Branch control over the Commission.  While </p><p>the case against Speaker Na Abba seems to have been placed </p><p>on the backburner, the case against Anyim has remained </p><p>active thus the Senate has taken the lead in proposing the </p><p>amendment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) There are provisions in the amended bill to grant </p><p>immunity to Members of the Legislature, even after they </p><p>leave office.  Several interest groups including the </p><p>National Labor Congress, the National Bar Association and </p><p>student associations have publicly opposed the new </p><p>amendment contending that it would weaken the ICPC and </p><p>undermine the national effort against corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Akanbi has publicly threatened to resign if the </p><p>current amendment becomes law.  A key change in the </p><p>proposed amendment allows the Chief Justice of the </p><p>Federation to appoint a serving judge as head of the </p><p>Commission, albeit with the advice and consent of the </p><p>Senate.  This would remove Akanbi, a retired jurist, from </p><p>his position as Chairman.  Justice Akanbi stated that he </p><p>did not question the integrity of the Chief Justice and no </p><p>problem being removed as Chair of the Commission. However, </p><p>he said, "the new law is designed to frustrate anti- </p><p>corruption efforts and seeks to subjugate the Commission", </p><p>and he would not serve if the law were passed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Justice Akanbi said that he "aims to set a solid </p><p>foundation" for the Commission.  The Commission staff of 23 </p><p>prosecutors, 26 investigators, and six advisors from the </p><p>security service, is currently pursuing 17 cases involving </p><p>39 individuals.  Among others, there are 14 Governors under </p><p>investigation.  Akanbi listed UNDP, GTZ, DFID and USAID in </p><p>addition to INL among its supporters and stated that the </p><p>Commission could use more staff and vehicles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) After Justice Akanbi again thanked the Ambassador </p><p>for US support, the Ambassador told Akanbi that "given the </p><p>level of support from various interest groups, and the fact </p><p>that four members of the House have gone to court against </p><p>the amendment, the legislation may never see the light of </p><p>day."  The Ambassador added, "if the Commission is being </p><p>made ineffective for the narrow interest of some </p><p>legislators to protect themselves, it is doubtful that the </p><p>US can continue to </p><p>support the ICPC." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
