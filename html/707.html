THE PRAGMATIC BSP </p><p>CHAIRMAN SINCE 1991, VIDENOV HAS INCREASINGLY ASSERTED </p><p>HIS INDEPENDENCE FROM HARDLINE AND REFORM WINGS OF THE </p><p>BSP.  THE RESIDENT WORLD BANK REP CONSIDERS HIM TO BE </p><p>"SOMEONE THE BANK CAN WORK WITH."  BORN 3/22/59, VIDENOV </p><p>IS THE YOUNGEST MEMBER OF THE CABINET.  HE SPEAKS </p><p>ENGLISH, RUSSIAN, ARABIC AND SOME FRENCH. </p><p> </p><p>DONCHO KONAKCHIEV -- FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND </p><p>MINISTER FOR TERRITORIAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION. </p><p>A CLOSE VIDENOV CONFIDANT, KONAKCHIEV MADE AN </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL BID TO BE MAYOR OF SOFIA.  BORN 3/17/43. </p><p> </p><p>KIRIL TSOCHEV -- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER OF </p><p>TRADE AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION.  TSOCHEV RETURNS TO THE </p><p>POST HE HELD FOR SIX MONTHS IN 1994 UNDER THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF P.M. LYUBEN BEROV.  A PRAGMATIC TECHNOCRAT, TSOCHEV </p><p>CONDUCTED AN OPEN-DOOR POLICY TO THE U.S. DURING HIS </p><p>TENURE, ALTHOUGH HE HAD LIMITED INFLUENCE AND IS NOT </p><p>EXPECTED TO BE A HEAVYWEIGHT IN VIDENOV\'S GOVERNMENT. </p><p>HE IS RUMORED TO BE CLOSE TO ANDREI LUKANOV, A POWERFUL </p><p>BEHIND-THE-SCENES LEADER IN THE BSP.  BORN 4/4/47, </p><p>TSOCHEV SPEAKS ENGLISH AND RUSSIAN. </p><p> </p><p>RUMEN GECHEV -- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FOR ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  A RISING STAR IN THE BSP, GECHEV WILL BE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, INVESTMENTS AND </p><p>PRIVATIZATION.  A PROPONENT OF STATE SUBSIDIES TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        SOFIA  00528  01 OF 03  240820Z </p><p>INCREASE PRODUCTION, GECHEV WAS A FULBRIGHTER IN </p><p>ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS FROM 1987-88. </p><p>BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THE EXPERIENCE DID LITTLE TO ENLIGHTEN </p><p>HIS VIEWS ON ECONOMICS.  BORN 10/4/56, HE SPEAKS ENGLISH </p><p>AND RUSSIAN. </p><p> </p><p>SVETOSLAV SHIVAROV -- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER WITHOUT </p><p>PORTFOLIO.  SHIVAROV, WHO IS CHAIRMAN OF THE BSP </p><p>COALITION PARTNER, THE ALEXANDER STAMBOLIYSKI AGRARIAN </p><p>PARTY, OWES HIS NEWLY-CREATED JOB TO A PRE-ELECTION </p><p>AGREEMENT.  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT SHIVAROV\'S ROLE WILL </p><p>BE.  HE IS A LAWYER BY TRAINING, BORN IN 2/7/44. </p><p> </p><p>GEORGI PIRINSKI -- MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. </p><p>PIRINSKI, WHO SERVED AS A DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER UNDER </p><p>THE BSP GOVERNMENT OF ANDREI LUKANOV IN 1991, IS A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE BSP\'S REFORMIST "SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC" WING. </p><p>A POLISHED DIPLOMAT, HE WILL PROMOTE BULGARIA\'S </p><p>CONTINUED INTEGRATION WITH EUROPE, BUT IS NOT PRO-NATO-- </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE PRESS, HE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY CHOSEN OVER </p><p>FELLOW-REFORMIST PHILIP BOKOV BECAUSE OF THE LATTER\'S </p><p>PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR BULGARIAN MEMBERSHIP IN NATO.

HE IS NOT A U.S. CITIZEN.  HE SPEAKS </p><p>ENGLISH, FRENCH AND RUSSIAN.

THIS APPOINTMENT </p><p>WAS A SURPRISE IN THAT PIRINSKI HAS A VERY STRONG </p><p>ECONOMIC FOUNDATION AND IT WAS EXPECTED THAT IF HE GOT </p><p>AN APPOINTMENT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT AREA. </p><p> </p><p>DIMITUR PAVLOV -- MINISTER OF DEFENSE.  A RETIRED </p><p>ADMIRAL SINCE 1993 AND FORMER NAVAL CHIEF OF STAFF, </p><p>PETROV HAS BEEN DEPUTY MINDEF UNDER THE LAST TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS AND HAS CLOSE TIES TO THE BSP.  HE HAS </p><p>VISITED THE U.S. AND SEEKS GOOD RELATIONS WITH WESTERN </p><p>MILITARIES.  BORN 9/7/37, HE SPEAKS RUSSIAN AND </p><p>UNDERSTANDS SOME ENGLISH. </p><p> </p><p>DIMITUR KOSTOV -- MINISTER OF FINANCE.  KOSTOV HAS BEEN </p><p>FIRST DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER SINCE 1992, IS NOT A BSP </p><p>MEMBER, AND IS REPORTED TO BE THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT WITHIN </p><p>THE MINISTRY.  HIS SELECTION FOR WHAT MAY BE THE MOST </p><p>CRITICAL MINISTRY IN THE NEXT GOVERNMENT SIGNALS A </p><p>WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF THE BSP TO WORK WITH THE </p><p>IFI\'S, TO WHOM KOSTOV IS WELL AND FAVORABLY KNOWN-- </p><p>ALTHOUGH HIS NON-PARTY STATUS ALSO MAKES KOSTOV </p><p>EXPENDABLE IF THE GOING GETS ROUGH.  KOSTOV SPENT A YEAR </p><p>IN THE U.S. AND IS CLOSE TO THE UDF, BULGARIA\'S </p><p>OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC COALITION.  HE WAS BORN 9/21/57. </p><p> </p><p>LYUBOMIR NACHEV -- MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR.  A FORMER </p><p>BSP M.P. WHOSE BACKGROUND AS A CRIMINOLOGIST IN THIS </p><p>MINISTRY PORTENDS A HALT TO THE MODEST REFORMS </p><p>UNDERTAKEN TO DATE IN THIS KEY MINISTRY.  BORN 10/22/54. </p><p> </p><p>MLADEN CHERVENYAKOV -- MINISTER OF JUSTICE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        SOFIA  00528  02 OF 03  240822Z </p><p>CHERVENYAKOV WAS ONE OF THE BSP REPRESENTATIVES TO THE </p><p>NATIONAL ELECTION COMMISSION THAT OVERSAW THE 1994 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  A LAWYER AND FORMER </p><p>PROSECUTOR, HE WAS BORN 8/22/54 AND SPEAKS RUSSIAN AND </p><p>ENGLISH. </p><p> </p><p>VASIL CHICHIBABA -- MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE. </p><p>CHICHIBABA\'S CANDIDACY WAS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL OF ALL </p><p>THOSE PROPOSED BY VIDENOV.  ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, </p><p>BSP\'ERS CRITICIZED HIS LACK OF PERSPECTIVE TO MANAGE </p><p>NATIONAL POLICY.  A MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT BSP </p><p>HARDLINERS HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN CHICHIBABA\'S STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT FOR REFORMS WITHIN THE NATIONAL AGRARIAN ACADEMY </p><p>IN 1992.  CHICHIBABA, WHO IS A LONGTIME MEMBER OF </p><p>SHIVAROV\'S ALEXANDER STAMBOLIYSKI AGRARIANS, OWES HIS </p><p>JOB TO A PRE-ELECTION UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AGRARIANS </p><p>WOULD GET THIS MINISTRY. </p><p> </p><p>KLIMENT VUCHEV -- MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY.  VUCHEV </p><p>REPRESENTS BULGARIA\'S MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE MILITARY ELECTRONIC PRODUCER "ELECTRON" </p><p>AND A FORMER MIDDLE MANAGER IN "METALCHIM" HOLDING, </p><p>WHICH CONTROLS THE SPRAWLING VASOV MACHINE </p><p>TOOL/AMMUNITION PLANT COMPLEX IN SOPOT.  HIS SELECTION </p><p>INDICATES CLEARLY THE BSP\'S INTENTION TO REVIVE </p><p>BULGARIA\'S MILITARY INDUSTRIES.  BORN 10/30/37. </p><p> </p><p>ILCHO IVANOV DIMITROV --  MINISTER OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE </p><p>AND TECHNOLOGY.  THE MOST RETROGRADE OF ALL VIDENOV\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENTS, DIMITROV WAS MINISTER EDUCATION UNDER </p><p>TODOR ZHIVKOV, COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY AND, LATER, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        SOFIA  00528  02 OF 03  240822Z </p><p>RECTOR OF SOFIA UNIVERSITY AND A MARXIST HISTORIAN. </p><p>BORN IN 6/3/31, HE SPEAKS RUSSIAN AND FRENCH. </p><p> </p><p>MINCHO KORALSKI -- MINISTER OF LABOR AND SOCIAL </p><p>AFFAIRS.  A DEPUTY MINISTER FOR THESE ISSUES UNDER THREE </p><p>DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS BETWEEN 1990-92, KORALSKI IS </p><p>REPOREDLY VERY CLOSE TO VALENTIN MOLLOV, A MEDIA MAGNATE </p><p>AND MEMBER OF THE SO-CALLED "G-13" GROUP OF PRIVATE </p><p>INDUSTRIALISTS WHO CONTROL LARGE SEGMENTS OF THE </p><p>ECONOMY.  HE WAS BORN 9/5/51. </p><p> </p><p>MIMI VITKOVA -- MINISTER OF HEALTH.  A BSP DEPUTY IN THE </p><p>LAST THREE PARLIAMENTS, VITKOVA IS A CARDIOLOGIST AND </p><p>OUTSPOKEN OPPONENT OF PRIVATE MEDICAL PRACTICES.  SHE </p><p>SPEAKS RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH AND WAS BORN 11/21/50. </p><p> </p><p>STAMEN STAMENOV -- MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION.  STAMENOV </p><p>WAS APPOINTED HEAD OF BULGARIAN STATE RAILWAYS IN JUNE </p><p>1994 FOLLOWING THE FIRING OF HIS PREDECESSOR FOR, AMONG </p><p>OTHER OFFENSES, PERMITTING MASSIVE VIOLATIONS OF THE </p><p>EMBARGO AGAINST SERBIA.  STAMENOV, BORN 7/7/38, HAS OVER </p><p>THREE DECADES\' EXPERIENCE WITH BULGARIAN RAILROADS. </p><p> </p><p>GEORGI DIMITROV GEORGIEV -- MINISTER OF THE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ6058 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6058 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        SOFIA  00528  03 OF 03  231639Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-01   BIB-01   CEA-01   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  OASY-00  DODE-00  EB-01    EXIM-01  E-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  FRB-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-01 </p><p>      ADS-00   M-00     NRRC-00  NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SB-00    SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DRL-09   G-00       /025W </p><p>                  ------------------9E536A  231640Z /38 </p><p>O 231629Z JAN 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY SOFIA </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 2497 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 SOFIA 000528 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, ECON, BU </p><p>SUBJECT:  IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE:  BULGARIA\'S </p><p>SOCIALIST PARTY CABINET INCLUDES SOME MODERATES </p><p> </p><p>ENVIRONMENT.

WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IS WHETHER VIDENOV </p><p>WILL TAKE HIS CUE FROM THOSE MINISTERS CONVINCED OF THE </p><p>NEED FOR COOPERATION WITH THE IFI\'S AND INTEGRATION WITH </p><p>THE WEST, OR FROM THE MORE NUMEROUS HARDLINERS IN HIS </p><p>CABINET WHO SEEK INSTEAD A RETURN TO STATIST ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICIES.
