<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 001616 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, Human Rights, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: WAR AND PEACE IN KAREN STATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary:  In a recent visit to the small border town </p><p>of Myawaddy in eastern Karen State, Poloff found some </p><p>residual conflict between regime forces and Karen National </p><p>Union (KNU) forces.  Although the KNU appears to have been </p><p>reduced to hit and run, guerilla-type attacks, the rugged </p><p>mountain terrain has thwarted regime efforts to gain total </p><p>control of the area.  The border with Thailand in this area </p><p>of Karen State appeared quite porous with Burmese workers and </p><p>small shipments of goods moving back and forth to Thailand, </p><p>mostly outside official channels.  Aside from the township of </p><p>Myawaddy, which is closely tied to the Thai economy, the </p><p>areas in this part of Burma are suffering badly from the </p><p>continued fighting and failed economic and social programs of </p><p>the SPDC.  While the local population complained bitterly </p><p>about the regime there was little evidence of support for the </p><p>KNU\'s continued raids, which disrupt commercial activities. </p><p>The NLD was reorganizing in several towns we visited and its </p><p>leaders said it has more support than ever due to the failed </p><p>policies of the SPDC. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Road Less Traveled..... </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  Poloff traveled by car from Rangoon to the eastern </p><p>Karen State border town of Myawaddy from November 19-21. </p><p>This was the first time in recent years that the SPDC had </p><p>allowed a foreigner other than International Committee for </p><p>the Red Cross staff to travel to Myawaddy from Rangoon. </p><p>(Ironically, foreigners can freely enter Myawaddy from the </p><p>Thailand side of the border between the hours 6 a.m. and 6 </p><p>p.m.)  The drive took a bone rattling 13 hours over two days </p><p>to cover just 290 miles. </p><p> </p><p>Thamanya Sayadaw </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  The venerable Buddhist Abbot Thamanya Sayadaw is a </p><p>vocal, if slightly eccentric, advocate of political change in </p><p>Burma living near the town of Hpa\'an.  Besides seeing to the </p><p>upgrading of local roads, the Sayadaw provides protection and </p><p>support for a growing community of followers near his </p><p>monastery.  The Sayadaw\'s community appeared to be thriving; </p><p>businesses were active, homes were wooden instead of thatch, </p><p>and there were more cars, trucks, and motorcycles than in </p><p>towns nearer to Bago, thanks to contributions from around </p><p>Burma which the Sayadaw has funneled back into his community. </p><p> We were told that while the SPDC does not approve of the </p><p>Sayadaw\'s politics (Aung San Suu Kyi\'s first trip from </p><p>Rangoon after her May 6 release was to see him) they </p><p>grudgingly accept his community activities because he is so </p><p>popular with the people. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Given the fractious political situation in Burma and </p><p>the lack of government funding for public projects, the </p><p>Sayadaw appears to have carved out a small but healthy patch </p><p>of civil society.  In many ways, he is the epitome of a </p><p>Buddhist saint -- a source of grace and charity for his </p><p>people, who in turn accept his claims of semi-divine status. </p><p>The people, in any case, work hard and share in the benefits </p><p>of a functioning community. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  The abysmal condition of the rest of the roads from </p><p>Bago to Hpa\'an (at some points it was easier taking the ox </p><p>cart path than to stay on the road) was indicative of the </p><p>generally backward conditions in the area outside the </p><p>Thamanya\'s safety net.  While the economy is agrarian, it </p><p>appears to be limited to small-scale subsistence farming.  In </p><p>one area there were remnants of what once must have been </p><p>large rubber plantations.  Now, families harvest the rubber </p><p>independently, cure the sheets of rubber in front of their </p><p>huts, and sell them for about fifty cents a piece.  The only </p><p>industries visible along the route were a palm oil plant, a </p><p>sugar mill near Hpa\'an and several rock quarries. </p><p> </p><p>Burma Army and DKBA Attempt to Control the Border </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  Leaving Hpa\'an on the road to Myawaddy, the frequency </p><p>of Burma Army encampments and Democratic Karen Buddhist Army </p><p>(DKBA) patrols increased significantly.  The DKBA, a group </p><p>which rebelled from the largely Christian KNU and reached a </p><p>cease-fire agreement with the SPDC in the late 1990\'s, has </p><p>continued to attract young Karen Buddhists who are looking </p><p>for action.  There are an estimated 5,000 DKBA troops in </p><p>Myawaddy alone and the organization reportedly controls most </p><p>of the economic activity in the corridor from Thailand to </p><p>Hpa\'an.  The DKBA\'s relative wealth was evident as they were </p><p>typically seen in new Ford and Toyota double cab trucks </p><p>carrying five to twelve DKBA "soldiers" in the back.  The </p><p>DKBA soldiers\' morale was visibly higher than the Burma Army </p><p>troops, who generally looked sullen and underfed, but it did </p><p>not appear that discipline was high.   Relations between DKBA </p><p>and Burmese Army troops  appeared good, though they did not </p><p>mix forces or appear to socialize together.  We followed one </p><p>DKBA soldier on a motorcycle who was handing out money to </p><p>Burmese soldiers posted along the road.  He told Poloff that </p><p>he was providing "tea money," amounting to about fifty cents, </p><p>to each of soldiers "just to help them out." </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  DKBA and Burma Army troops were in evidence from a </p><p>checkpoint 30 miles west of the Thai border onward.  As the </p><p>road climbed through the jungle, two or three Burma Army </p><p>soldiers were stationed every few hundred yards.  There were </p><p>signs warning of mines along the roadside and bridges were </p><p>closely guarded and encircled with two sets of bamboo fences, </p><p>presumably to deter KNU attacks on the bridges.  The Burma </p><p>Army had several outposts on the road, each with double </p><p>layers of bamboo fencing that could be closed once traffic </p><p>had passed.  The army troops stationed on the mountain were </p><p>dug-in and remained mostly out of sight.  We were told by </p><p>various sources that there were KNU attacks every week or </p><p>two, mainly by snipers on army troops or ambushes of DKBA </p><p>vehicles on the main road, in addition to skirmishes in the </p><p>jungle.  There were also reportedly villages in the area, </p><p>even within Myawaddy township, that still supported the KNU </p><p>in spite of the government\'s decade long effort to quash </p><p>them. </p><p> </p><p>Myawaddy - Almost Heaven..... </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  On the outskirts of Myawaddy a long line of buses and </p><p>trucks queued on the road to process through a checkpoint. </p><p>When Poloff arrived at the checkpoint, officials demanded to </p><p>know why he was there and then attempted to search the </p><p>vehicle.  Once cooler heads prevailed the officials backed </p><p>down, but it was clear that the intimidation level for normal </p><p>travelers was quite high.  On the return trip through this </p><p>checkpoint the following morning, there were approximately </p><p>fifty to sixty heavily laden trucks and buses waiting for </p><p>inspection before their journey over the mountain range. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  Once in the town of Myawaddy, the heavy military </p><p>presence of the mountain pass and checkpoints gave way to a </p><p>thriving commercial center more closely linked to the economy </p><p>in Thailand than in Burma.  In fact, the residents and </p><p>merchants used the Thai baht instead of the Burmese kyat in </p><p>all transactions.  Also, virtually everyone, even bicycle </p><p>trishaw drivers, carried a Thai cellular telephone. </p><p>Ironically, with landlines to Rangoon down or of such poor </p><p>quality that calls were almost impossible, the cellular </p><p>phones made it easier to call Singapore from Myawaddy than to </p><p>call Rangoon (international rates to Burma are extremely </p><p>high). </p><p> </p><p>11. (U)  There were also many more new vehicles in Myawaddy </p><p>than in areas further inside Burma.  Locals explained that </p><p>the DKBA controls vehicle imports into Myawaddy but the </p><p>vehicles cannot be registered with the Burmese government or </p><p>taken past Myawaddy (although this appears to be loosely </p><p>enforced, as we saw many DKBA in new trucks and motorcycles </p><p>on the road to Hpa\'an).  The prices for these vehicles were </p><p>one-tenth the price of similar vehicles in Rangoon where </p><p>imports are tightly controlled by the SPDC.  One source </p><p>estimated that of the 1,000 vehicles in Myawaddy only 50 were </p><p>registered with the Burmese government.  These fifty, </p><p>however, were said to be the only ones allowed to transit </p><p>freely to Thailand.  Thus, they generated a lot of income for </p><p>their owners by transiting goods and people across the border. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U)  Although Burmese immigration officials prohibited </p><p>Poloff and two accompanying local staff from crossing "the </p><p>friendship bridge" into Thailand ("we cannot allow it without </p><p>instructions from higher authorities"), other Burmese were </p><p>allowed to cross for a fee of about fifty cents.  Just under </p><p>the bridge, right in front of a Burma Army bunkered machine </p><p>gun nest, there was an active trade in illegal crossings by </p><p>boys with inner tubes willing to paddle passengers across the </p><p>shallow river for a few pennies.  The border is quite porous </p><p>in Karen State, with the Burma Army controlling the two </p><p>"official" crossing points, Myawaddy and Three Pagodas Pass, </p><p>while the DKBA controls five other "major" crossings.  The </p><p>KNU or others control many smaller crossings.  Thus, we were </p><p>told, when the Burmese government closed the border earlier </p><p>this year, it diminished the flow of people and goods at </p><p>official crossings but most of the traffic just shifted to </p><p>other crossing points. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U)  Poloff attempted to visit the SPDC reception center </p><p>for the repatriation of Burmese migrants from Thailand but </p><p>was blocked from the facility first by an armed soldier, then </p><p>by a military intelligence (MI) officer.  The only </p><p>information the MI officer was willing to share about the </p><p>facility was that it continued to process repatriations even </p><p>while the border was closed and that most returning migrants </p><p>spend only one night at the center before being transferred </p><p>to Hpa\'an for additional processing. </p><p> </p><p>NLD On the Rise </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  Poloff met with NLD leaders in Hpa\'an, Kawkareik, </p><p>and Myawaddy, all of whom were rebuilding their party </p><p>organizations and believed that the NLD enjoyed more popular </p><p>support now than in 1990.  They all said that while most </p><p>people are still afraid to openly support the NLD, </p><p>frustration with SPDC policies and the economy is very high </p><p>and the people want change.  In Hpa\'an and Myawaddy, the </p><p>leaders said that MI was aware of their reorganization </p><p>activities and was not blocking them (although harassment of </p><p>their families and business activities continued.) </p><p> </p><p>15. (C)  In Kawkareik, the NLD leader said that he did not </p><p>think MI was aware of his reorganization activities but that </p><p>they would be now that we had visited (MI was closely </p><p>monitoring the entire trip).  He said that this was fine, he </p><p>wanted to tell MI the truth and he did not fear their </p><p>reaction.  In 1998, he had closed the NLD office under </p><p>pressure from MI because "we thought they were going to kill </p><p>us."  Recently, he said he senses that MI, at least in his </p><p>town, no longer wants the conflict and is doing the minimum </p><p>to follow up on orders from Rangoon.  Poloff asked that he </p><p>try to get word to NLD headquarters if he was wrong and there </p><p>was any retribution based on Poloff\'s visit (the same message </p><p>was conveyed to each NLD leader visited).  Thus far we have </p><p>received no reports of problems. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C)  Asked if the local population supported the KNU in </p><p>its fight against the SPDC, the NLD leaders opined that while </p><p>the people despise the regime, they also are tired of the </p><p>fighting that disrupts their lives.  They said only a small </p><p>percentage of the population still actively supports the KNU </p><p>while the majority want peaceful change through NLD and Aung </p><p>San Suu Kyi.  Asked if the DKBA would support the NLD if it </p><p>there were free elections, the NLD leaders said it might. </p><p>They noted that DKBA support for the SPDC is based only on </p><p>the economic concessions it receives; otherwise it too </p><p>condemns SPDC policies.  The NLD leaders felt that if the </p><p>DKBA had a choice it would join hands with the NLD. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
