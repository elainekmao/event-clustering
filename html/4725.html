<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002312 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, PINR, PARM, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: GSL MINISTOR MORAGODA SAYS INDIANS MAD AT JAPANESE </p><p>AND WORRIED ABOUT US ROLE IN NEPAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR E. ASHLEY WILLS.  REASONS:  1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  GSL Minister Milinda Moragoda told me over </p><p>the weekend that the Indians are "really mad" over the </p><p>attempts by the Japanese to involve themselves in Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>negotiation to end the war.  Moragoda said Indian Foreign </p><p>Secretary Sibal, who visited Colombo last week, was </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"comfortable" with U.S. interest and activities in Sri Lanka </p><p>but "very worried" about American military support to the </p><p>Government of Nepal.  Moragoda also indicated that Indian </p><p>Secretary to the PM Brajesh Mishra had deliberately slowed </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>down the GOI\'s move toward signing an ACSA with the U.S.G. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Moragoda called me over the weekend and asked for a </p><p>quick meeting before his trip this week to New Delhi and </p><p>Tokyo.  We met at Jefferson House Sunday, December 15. </p><p> </p><p>Resentment of the Japanese </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Moragoda reported that in his visits to New Delhi </p><p>before and after the last round of talks in Oslo early in </p><p>December, and again when Indian Foreign Secretary Sibal </p><p>visited Colombo last week, he had heard "an earful" about the </p><p>GOI\'s unhappiness with Japanese attempts to involve </p><p>themselves in Sri Lanka\'s negotiation to end the war.  In his </p><p>meetings with Brajesh Mishra in the PMO, Foreign Minister </p><p>Sinha and Foreign Secretary Sibal, Moragoda found the Indians </p><p>"really mad" at alleged Japanese presumption.  Moragoda </p><p>indicated that the Indians expressed general displeasure at </p><p>Japan\'s "insinuating" itself into a process being handled </p><p>"competently" by the Norwegians. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  As more specific examples of the Indian attitude, </p><p>Moragoda told me the GOJ had apparently proposed assigning </p><p>Japanese monitors to the Scandanavian-staffed Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission.  When the Indians were consulted, they </p><p>nixed the proposal.  Similarly, according to Moragoda, the </p><p>Japanese Foreign Minister had proposed stopping in Bangkok in </p><p>early January on her way to an official visit to Colombo. </p><p>She first proposed a side meeting with the GSL and LTTE </p><p>delegations in Bangkok, then backed off a bit and suggested a </p><p>cocktail.  The GOI, which the GSL informed of the proposals, </p><p>again objected, apparently in strong terms.  And Foreign </p><p>Secretary Sibal apparently expressed unhappiness over the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>decision to allow the Japanese to host a round of the peace </p><p>talks early next year.  In the latter case, apparently, the </p><p>Indians were not consulted until after the decision was made </p><p>and announced publicly. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  I probed Moragoda a bit about why the Indians were </p><p>reacting so viscerally.  He said he\'d heard that the GOI was </p><p>"deeply annoyed" by Japanese opposition to an Indian motion </p><p>within the IAEA to draw attention to Pakistan\'s illicit </p><p>nuclear cooperation with North Korea.  But there were other, </p><p>less proximate reasons as well.  Mishra called the Japanese </p><p>"artless" and alleged that the GOJ was "heedless of vital </p><p>Indian security interests."  Foreign Minister Sinha, </p><p>meanwhile, asked rhetorically "who is Japan to get involved </p><p>in our region?"  The general view, according to Moragoda, was </p><p>that the Indians felt the Japanese were "overstepping". </p><p> </p><p>More Tolerance for Us </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  By contrast, Moragoda found the Indians more </p><p>"comfortable" with the US role in Sri Lanka.  "We have a </p><p>dialogue with the Americans," Moragoda quoted Sibal, "and </p><p>although we may not agree on everything, we at least </p><p>consult."  Moragoda claimed Mishra, Sinha and Sibal all felt </p><p>at ease with U.S. actions in Sri Lanka but also expressed the </p><p>need to be kept fully informed, by the GSL and the U.S.G., </p><p>concerning our actions here. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  There was less ease in New Delhi about our policy in </p><p>Nepal, according to Moragoda.  He said Sibal had been quite </p><p>explicit on this point.  "The Americans tend toward military </p><p>solutions," he quoted Sibal.  In Nepal\'s case, Sibal thought </p><p>this a big mistake.  Moragoda said he decried our decision to </p><p>sell sophisticated weapons to an "unsophisticated" Nepalese </p><p>military.  These weapons, the Indians feared, would end up </p><p>sooner or later, probably sooner, being captured by the </p><p>Maoists, who would in turn use them themselves or, even </p><p>worse, sell them to any of several separatist groups </p><p>operating in India. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Although New Delhi was generally positive about the </p><p>U.S., Moragoda reported, he cited one exception:  our attempt </p><p>to sign an ACSA with the GOI.  This had come to Mishra\'s </p><p>attention, Moragoda told me, and he had deliberately ordered </p><p>the Indian bureaucracy to slow down its move toward signing </p><p>an ACSA with the U.S.  Moragoda did not know if the Indians </p><p>would eventually sign. </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  It did not surprise me that the Indians resent the </p><p>moves by the Japanese to involve themselves in Sri Lanka. </p><p>The Indians may have to reconcile themselves to our role </p><p>because we are the alpha dog, but the Japanese will find </p><p>themselves barked at and bitten by the Indians until they </p><p>show respect for Delhi\'s status.  It would probably help </p><p>matters if the Japanese Foreign Minister or at least Special </p><p>Envoy Akashi were to visit New Delhi soon. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
