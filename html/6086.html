<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000451 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   In an opinion piece carried in the March 2 edition of </p><p>      the government-controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail," Dr. </p><p>      Tafataona Mahoso criticized the United States and Britain </p><p>      for appearing to be "arm-twisting" the United Nations to </p><p>      sanction the war against Iraq.  Under headline "Sinister </p><p>      motives fuel assault on Iraq: "Britain and U. S. arm-twist </p><p>      U. N. to bless illegal war," Mahoso argues: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "An impressive number of international summits and </p><p>      conferences have come out clearly on the side of </p><p>      peace and against the threatened U. S. - UK war on </p><p>      Iraq.  A few weeks ago, the African Union declared </p><p>      its position against war. . .All these are </p><p>      impressive expressions of world opinion, when taken </p><p>      together with the millions of demonstrators who took </p><p>      to the streets on 15 February on all five continents </p><p>      of the globe.  But there is now a need for the key </p><p>      members of the coalition, especially NAM, to think </p><p>      ahead beyond the current stalemate between U. S, </p><p>      weapons of mass destruction, on the one hand, and </p><p>      the moral power of the loose anti-war alliance on </p><p>      the other.  First of all, too many opponents of the </p><p>      war in Europe and America are opposing it just so </p><p>      that history will count them as having expressed </p><p>      doubts about it but having failed to stop it.  This </p><p>      is particularly true of the white liberals in North </p><p>      America.  They know that the U. S. military- </p><p>      industrial complex stands to make huge profits from </p><p>      weapons and oil if the war takes place.  However, </p><p>      they wish Bush and Blair would not wage the war </p><p>      without first bribing the U. N. to bless the war. </p><p>      This is where the African Union and NAM stand out. </p><p>      They see the war as a most horrific holocaust, </p><p>      whether or not the U. S. and UK manage to bribe the </p><p>      U. N. to bless it.  In other words, too many in the </p><p>      North oppose only the Bush-Blair means of waging the </p><p>      assault on Iraq.  They would go quiet if Blair and </p><p>      Bush succeeded in making the proposed genocide </p><p>      legal.  The view from the South, on the other hand, </p><p>      is that Iraq is only a sacrificial lamb, another </p><p>      means to an end; just as Yugoslavia was also a means </p><p>      to an end. </p><p> </p><p>      "The real objectives of the war are: To bring </p><p>      western and central Asia firmly under the unipolar </p><p>      system dominated by the U. S., and to prevent a </p><p>      possible coalition or alliance of the future which </p><p>      could bring Russia, India and China together, </p><p>      especially if Namibia\'s proposal to make India a </p><p>      permanent Security Council member were to succeed; </p><p>      To bring all major oil reserves under U. S. control; </p><p>      even Sudan and Nigeria will not be spared; To wage </p><p>      war on the old U. N. system before its Security </p><p>      Council mechanism is captured by a coalition of </p><p>      emerging powers and used to neutralize the U. S.-UK </p><p>      alliance. . .; To use the oil power so obtained as </p><p>      means of controlling the allies of the U. S. who may </p><p>      be threatening to declare their independence from </p><p>      their post-Second World War dependence on North </p><p>      America.  Now, the main objective of the loose </p><p>      alliance against war should be to stop the </p><p>      aggression before it happens. . .So the loose </p><p>      alliance needs to become tighter and immediately </p><p>      announce that a unilateral war on Iraq will mean: </p><p>      That the majority of U. N. members would decide to </p><p>      forfeit U. S. contributions to the budget of the </p><p>      same and move the U. N. headquarters out of the U. </p><p>      S. for good; That the majority of the U. N. members </p><p>      would immediately change the U. N. Security Council </p><p>      system by creating new permanent members such as </p><p>      Brazil, India and the AU; That the majority would </p><p>      seek to tighten their anti-war alliance until it can </p><p>      impose some trade sanctions against the U. S.; That </p><p>      the coalition would agitate for the removal of U. S. </p><p>      military bases from member states, especially in the </p><p>      South. </p><p> </p><p>      "These ideas follow from a logical analysis of the </p><p>      situation.  In Yugoslavia, the U. S. managed to wage </p><p>      war on Europe, using NATO and making Europeans pay </p><p>      for the cost.  Many thought that would be the last </p><p>      war in which the U. N. was arm-twisted to bless an </p><p>      illegal war.  But it was not.  Over Afghanistan, the </p><p>      world at first went along with the `war on </p><p>      terrorism\' until that war became terrorism in </p><p>      itself.  Now, the aggression against Iraq just came </p><p>      out of the blue.  The attempts to justify it have </p><p>      been the weakest the world has ever heard compared </p><p>      to those for the Gulf war, the Yugoslav war and the </p><p>      Afghan war.  But the current attempts are costing </p><p>      the U. N. very dearly.  The whole system has been </p><p>      commandeered to make the war on Iraq appear to be </p><p>      the only business of the U. N. that is worth doing </p><p>      at present.  This should not be tolerated." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
