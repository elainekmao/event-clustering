<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000770 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ELAB, PGOV, KTIA, MARR, SNAR, KDEM, PHUM, EFIN, ETRD, CU, IR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PROTILLO </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 66351 B) GUATEMALA 0735 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN R. HAMILTON FOR REASON 1.5 (b) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) Summary: Over dinner at the residence March 22, </p><p>President Portillo acknowledged that Guatemala ought to </p><p>support a UNHCR resolution on Cuba but said he has a problem </p><p>with General Rios Montt\'s resentment over U.S. opposition to </p><p>his presidential candidacy.  Portillo said Guatemala agreed </p><p>with us that Iraq should stay in the UNSC.  He promised to </p><p>look into allegations reported by MINUGUA that a recent drug </p><p>bust was facilitated by illegal detentions and torture, as </p><p>the Ambassador warned him that such methods are totally </p><p>unacceptable.  He also pledged greater protection of labor </p><p>rights, particularly in areas highlighted by the AFL-CIO GSP </p><p>petition.  On his agenda: neutralizing perceived USG </p><p>opposition to a controversial bond issue and venting over </p><p>last October\'s congressional testimony that "did me </p><p>irreparable harm."  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador reciprocated March 22 Portillo\'s </p><p>February 25 dinner for the Ambassador.  Like that dinner, </p><p>this was a one-on-one that got down immediately to discussion </p><p>of a (mostly) pre-agreed agenda. </p><p> </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p>3. (C) Portillo said he had been watching CNN all day and </p><p>agreed with the Ambassador\'s observation that U.S. forces </p><p>were taking extraordinary precautions to minimize loss of </p><p>life and damage to infrastructure.  He did not commit to </p><p>coming any further toward support of our position in public </p><p>but did agree that the UNSC is the appropriate venue for any </p><p>further UN consideration of the issue. </p><p> </p><p>Cuba </p><p>---- </p><p>4. (C) Portillo said he completely agreed with the Ambassador </p><p>that Castro has again showed his true colors in the arrests </p><p>of the last week and mustered a seemingly genuine show of </p><p>indigation.  To the Ambassador\'s observation that surely, </p><p>after this, Guatemala would vote in favor of a resolution, </p><p>Portillo acknowledged that a yes vote is in order.  After </p><p>passing allusion to the views of FonMin Gutierrez (old line </p><p>leftist reluctance to fall in with the U.S. to condemn </p><p>Castro), however, Portillo said his main problem is with </p><p>General Rios Montt, who resents U.S. opposition to his </p><p>presidential ambitions.  The Ambassador again reviewed our </p><p>position on this (up to the FRG and the Guatemalan </p><p>constitutional court to decide whether Rios Montt runs but, </p><p>as President, Rios Montt could not expect warm relations with </p><p>the U.S.)  Portillo said he finds the U.S. position </p><p>understandable and realistic and said he tried to make the </p><p>General understand it but that Rios Montt is angry and the </p><p>subject pops up whenever the Cuba resolution is raised.  The </p><p>Ambassador was loaded for bear to refute the Guatemalan claim </p><p>(made by FonMin Gutierrez during the visit of Cuban FonMin </p><p>Perez Roque) that Cuban doctors here have achieved a "70 </p><p>percent reduction in infant mortality" but with Portillo </p><p>candidly admitting that Rios Montt is the problem, the </p><p>subject did not come up. </p><p> </p><p>Narcotics Certification </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador went over re-certification criteria in </p><p>detail with Portillo and gave him copy of the diplomatic </p><p>note, drawn from ref a, that explains the entire process and </p><p>sets forth the general and specific criteria.  Portillo made </p><p>a pitch for funds to repair Guatemalan helos.  The Ambassador </p><p>pointed him instead to quick adoption of asset forfeiture </p><p>legislation, saying aid to the military would violate the </p><p>spirit of U.S. legislative prohibitions on FMF.  Portillo </p><p>appeared to accept this answer and was aware that the FRG </p><p>caucus is busy on such an asset forfeiture bill.  The </p><p>Ambassador told Portillo that we have received a report of </p><p>testimony taken by MINUGUA to the effect that Guatemalan </p><p>police illegally detained and tortured two individuals to </p><p>extract information that led to the March 6 drug bust (ref </p><p>b).  The Ambassador said such actions, if true (and he noted </p><p>that we are checking) are totally unacceptable.  They would </p><p>be, moreover, extremely prejudicial to Guatemala\'s </p><p>possibiliies for re-certification, as one of the most </p><p>damaging charges against Guatemala last year was the </p><p>anti-drug police conduct at Chocon.  The Ambassador also </p><p>noted that, in this instance, it is possible that military </p><p>intelligence, not police, were responsible -- all the worse, </p><p>if true, the Ambassador said, repeating that this has to stop </p><p>immediately.  Portillo said he would find out immediately and </p><p>make sure it stopped.  He said he had already fired one </p><p>military intelligence official for a misguided effort to push </p><p>anti-drug efforts forward (note: which takes credit for </p><p>our/our insistence that this official be removed, but the </p><p>Ambassador led that point pass). </p><p>Article 98 </p><p>---------- </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador walked Portillo through this issue in </p><p>some detail.  Portillo was vaguely aware of it and promised </p><p>to consult with FonMin Gutierrez and get back to us. </p><p> </p><p>Labor Rights </p><p>------------ </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador briefed Portillo on the AFL-CIO GSP </p><p>labor petition, urging that he personally involve himself to </p><p>push for rapid progress in the three areas of deficiency: </p><p>lack of prosecution in cases of violence against labor </p><p>leaders; a clogged system of labor justice, and the system\'s </p><p>inability to force the re-hiring of illegally fired workers. </p><p>Portillo is familiar with the most egregious case of fired </p><p>workers (the Maria Lourdes finca case), said Labor Minister </p><p>Moreira is pushing for reforms to the labor code that could </p><p>clear up the backing of labor fines and other issues and </p><p>pledged to push for more vigorous investigations. </p><p> </p><p>"Eurobonds" </p><p>---------- </p><p>8. (C) Portillo as expected made a strong pitch for the USG </p><p>not to oppose the placing of a bond issue that includes US$63 </p><p>million for a first payment of US$225 compensation for </p><p>wartime services rendered to each of some 250,000 ex-civilian </p><p>patrol members.  He seemed to accept the Ambassador\'s reply </p><p>that, despite our deep misgivings over the appropriateness of </p><p>such compensation, especially in an election year, we had not </p><p>opposed the bond issue.  Portillo spoke at some length and </p><p>with some anxiety about the danger to public security and </p><p>order that the so-called Ex-Pacs represent.  He claimed that </p><p>their ambitions and resentments have been egged on </p><p>irresponsible elements in the ruling FRG, by the URNG (former </p><p>guerrillas) and by the PAN (center-right, leading </p><p>oppposition) and that a march on Guatemala City, if they make </p><p>one, could turn extremely violent.  Hence the importance of </p><p>buying them off. </p><p> </p><p>The October Testimony </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>9. (C) At one point Portillo went off on a tear, prefaced </p><p>only by "the spirit of candor that informs our discussions" </p><p>to complain bitterly of State Department congressional </p><p>testimony last October that he had links to organized crime. </p><p>He seemed  particularly hurt by the criticism of then A/S </p><p>Reich, with whom he thought he had had a strong personal </p><p>relationship.  The Ambassador said we could understand how he </p><p>felt, but what about financial contributions and his other </p><p>ties to the Ortega Menaldo crime syndicate of ex-military </p><p>officers?  Indignant (or with a good show of indignation), </p><p>Portillo responded with some heat that his entire campaign </p><p>was funded by banker Francisco Alvarado Maldonado.  Portillo </p><p>pointed out that Alvarado is currently being prosecuted for </p><p>the failure of his two banks, i.e., Portillo has not come to </p><p>his aid despite the past political support.  The Ambassador </p><p>let the subject drop without giving any indication that we </p><p>accept that reply at face value. </p><p> </p><p>CONTIERRA </p><p>--------- </p><p>10. (C) Portillo assured the Ambassador that CONTIERRA, the </p><p>government agency that seeks to resolve land tenure </p><p>conflicts, would be funded and kept in operation (note: there </p><p>has been doubt on this). </p><p> </p><p>Leadership of Guatemalan tax authority </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>11. (C) The Ambassador told Portillo that the quality of </p><p>performance at the Guatemalan tax authority (SAT) is </p><p>deteriorating badly since Marco Tulio Abadio took over as </p><p>Director in late 2002.  All the donor countries and the IFI\'s </p><p>are losing confidence in the SAT and are backing away from </p><p>their programs of support.  Portillo, showing no surprise, </p><p>said he would take (unspecified) action.  (Comment: Portillo </p><p>picked the mercurial Abadio to serve as an attack dog against </p><p>Portillo\'s private sector opponents.  He has not been </p><p>effective in his or other roles.) </p><p> </p><p>April 10 meeting with the President </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>12. (C) Portillo understands that CAFTA is the only issue for </p><p>discussion in the meeting between the President and the </p><p>Central American presidents, though he equally understands </p><p>that Cuba, Iraq and narcotics cooperation will come up in any </p><p>side meetings with senior U.S. officials. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>13. (C) Even on the subject of Eurobonds and Ortega Menaldo, </p><p>this was a civil exchange and it is clear that earning </p><p>re-certification and avoiding other blows to Guatemala\'s </p><p>image is high on Portillo\'s agenda in his final months. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
