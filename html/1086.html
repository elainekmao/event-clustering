(C) WHILE RECENT ATTENTION, NOTABLY OUTSIDE ZIMBABWE, HAS </p><p>FOCUSED ON THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE OCCURRING HERE, CONCURRENTLY A </p><p>SERIOUSLY DETERIORATING ECONOMY IS BEING PUSHED RAPIDLY DOWNHILL BY </p><p>THE ACTIONS AND INACTIONS OF A NEAR-TOTALLY DISTRACTED SENIOR </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  THE LARGEST AND MOST SERIOUS THREATS CAN BE DIVIDED </p><p>INTO TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES: 1) LAND INVASIONS AND THREATENED LAND </p><p>SEIZURES AIMED AT THE COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTOR; AND 2) FUEL AND </p><p>HARD CURRENCY SHORTAGES WHICH CRIPPLE THE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION OF </p><p>MANUFACTURERS ALREADY FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL IN AN EXTREMELY HOSTILE </p><p>OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.  THESE TWO SECTORS UNDERPIN THE FORMAL </p><p>ECONOMY, AND THE SERIOUS DAMAGE BEING DONE TO THEM WILL HAVE </p><p>NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES NOT ONLY THIS YEAR BUT IN YEARS TO COME, </p><p>THOUGH NO ONE IN LEADERSHIP SEEMS TO CARE.  THIS IS CERTAIN </p><p>REGARDLESS OF HOW GOOD OR BAD THE ELECTION PROCESS, RESULTS AND </p><p>IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH ARE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN ADDITION, IT IS SIMPLY TOO EARLY AT THIS TIME TO MAKE ANY </p><p>PREDICTIONS, BACKED UP BY CONFIDENCE, ON ZIMBABWE\'S POST-ELECTION </p><p>ECONOMY.  TO DO SO REQUIRES TWO CRITICAL INPUTS.  DOES THE MUGABE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02684  01 OF 04  190542Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT CURTAIL, CONTINUE OR EXPAND ITS USE OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>LAWLESS BEHAVIOR IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTIONS AND AFTER THE VOTE? </p><p>AND SECOND, WHAT WILL BE THE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND COMMITMENT LEVEL </p><p>OF THE POST-ELECTION GOVERNMENT?  IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>ECONOMY IS SUBSTANTIALLY WORSE THAN LAST YEAR\'S, AND EVEN IF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT RENEWS ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, HARD CURRENCY AND INVESTMENT WILL ONLY BEGIN FLOWING </p><p>THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THE LAND IS EVERYTHING! </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THIS RULING PARTY CAMPAIGN SLOGAN ("LAND IS THE ECONOMY & </p><p>THE ECONOMY IS THE LAND") CONTAINS, AT LEAST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC HEALTH, MORE TRUTH THAN THE PARTY\'S EX-SOCIALIST </p><p>LEADERSHIP PROBABLY REALIZES.  COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE ACCOUNTS </p><p>DIRECTLY FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S GROSS DOMESTIC </p><p>PRODUCT (GDP), AND INDIRECTLY FOR ANOTHER 12 TO 15 PERCENT </p><p>(COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE WAGE SPENDING, TRANSPORTATION, SUPPLY AND </p><p>EQUIPMENT SALES, SERVICES ETC.).  IN ADDITION, ABOUT 2 MILLION </p><p>PEOPLE (OUT OF A TOTAL POPULATION OF ABOUT 12 MILLION) LIVE ON </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMLAND AND DERIVE THEIR LIVELIHOOD FROM WAGES AND THE </p><p>FOOD THEY GROW ON THE FARMS.  THE WAGE EARNERS CONSTITUTE ABOUT A </p><p>FOURTH OF THE FORMAL LABOR FORCE.  FURTHERMORE, THE </p><p>INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FARMING AND INDUSTRY IS VERY CLOSE.  ABOUT </p><p>HALF OF ZIMBABWE\'S INDUSTRY IS AGRO-BASED, WHILE THE AGRICULTURAL </p><p>SECTOR CONSUMES ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF TOTAL INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT.  IN </p><p>OTHER WORDS, AT THE END OF THE DAY, COMMERCIAL FARMING PAYS THE RENT </p><p>AND KEEPS THE LIGHTS ON IN ZIMBABWE.  DESTROY IT, AND THE COUNTRY </p><p>COULD SINK LIKE A STONE.  DAMAGE IT, SAY BY TAKING AWAY 10 TO 40 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02684  01 OF 04  190542Z </p><p>PERCENT OF ITS ACREAGE AND OUTPUT AND, AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM, </p><p>THE ECONOMY WILL SUFFER COMMENSURATELY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE CURRENT LAND INVASION (OVER A 1000 FARMS OF </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 4400 HAVE BEEN AFFECTED) AND THE THREAT OF SEIZURE </p><p>WITHOUT COMPENSATION HAS MANY IMMEDIATE AND NEAR TERM NEGATIVE </p><p>EFFECTS.  FOR BANKS AND OTHER CREDIT-SUPPLIERS, THE COLLATERAL VALUE </p><p>OF LAND AND IMPROVEMENTS HAS CLEARLY FALLEN, MAKING LENDING </p><p>DIFFICULT.  UNCERTAINTY OVER THE ABILITY TO PREPARE FOR AND PLANT </p><p>NEXT SEASON\'S CROP MAKES LENDING ON A CASH-FLOW BASIS OVERLY RISKY. </p><p>INDEED, EVEN FOR THAT VERY SMALL MINORITY OF FARMERS WHO DO NOT NEED </p><p>THIRD-PARTY FUNDING TO OPERATE, THE INCENTIVE TO INVEST IN PRODUCING </p><p>A CROP WHICH MAY WELL BE STOLEN (PERHAPS ALONG WITH THE LAND AND ALL </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS), IS DEMOTIVATING, AT THE VERY LEAST.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>THIS YEAR\'S WHEAT CROP PLANTING, WHICH SHOULD BE TAKING PLACE NOW, </p><p>IS DOWN 30 TO 40 PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR WHICH MEANS THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>WILL HAVE TO IMPORT MUCH HIGHER AMOUNTS OF WHEAT IF BREAD IS GOING </p><p>TO BE AVAILABLE.  WHERE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE IS GOING TO COME FROM </p><p>TO PAY FOR THE INCREASED IMPORTS IS ANYBODY\'S GUESS.  ONE PIECE OF </p><p>GOOD NEWS IS THAT DESPITE DISRUPTIONS OF HARVESTING AND GRADING </p><p>CAUSED BY THE INVADERS, ABOVE-AVERAGE RAINS AND GOOD CONDITIONS HAVE </p><p>RESULTED IN A TOBACCO (AS WELL AS MAIZE) CROP THAT SHOULD EXCEED </p><p>LAST YEAR\'S IN VOLUME (ABOUT 230 MILLION KILOGRAMS VERSUS 210 LAST </p><p>YEAR).  THIS OPTIMISTIC PROJECTION IS TEMPERED, HOWEVER, BY SO FAR </p><p>WEAK INTERNATIONAL PRICES AND THE FACT THAT THE LACK OF A </p><p>DEVALUATION HAS MEANT THAT PROFIT MARGINS FOR MOST GROWERS WILL BE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4595 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02684  02 OF 04  190543Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-01    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NRRC-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------58C8BC  190543Z /38 </p><p>R 190546Z MAY 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6077 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 002684 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND GRACE SONE </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/18/10 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EAGR, PREL, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02684  02 OF 04  190543Z </p><p>SUBJECT: BEHIND THE POLITICAL CONFLAGRATION, ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY IS </p><p>BURNING TOO </p><p> </p><p>MARGINAL OR NIL.

(C) THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF A SERIOUS DISRUPTION TO COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMING INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p> -- A WORSENING OF THE HARD CURRENCY SHORTAGE, AS EXPORT EARNINGS </p><p>DECLINE WITH ALL THE ATTENDANT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES (FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>FUEL AND ELECTRICITY SHORTAGES, MOUNTING EXTERNAL DEBT ARREARS, </p><p>INABILITY TO IMPORT NEEDED INPUTS); </p><p> </p><p> -- INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT AS FARM WORKERS ARE LAID OFF AND </p><p>SIMULTANEOUSLY EJECTED FROM FARM HOUSING (BESIDES RENT-FREE HOUSING, </p><p>COMMONLY PROVIDED SERVICES INCLUDE WATER, ELECTRICITY, SEWAGE, BASIC </p><p>MEDICAL CARE AND SOMETIMES BASIC EDUCATION); </p><p> </p><p> -- INCREASED URBAN MIGRATION TO ALREADY OVERBURDENED CITIES WITH </p><p>TEEMING UNEMPLOYMENT; </p><p> </p><p> -- INCREASED INDUSTRIAL SLOWDOWN AND BUSINESS CLOSURES; </p><p> </p><p> -- A DETERIORATING SOVEREIGN CREDIT RATING; </p><p> </p><p> -- AND THE POSSIBILITY OF NEAR-UNIVERSAL DISAPPROVAL, POSSIBLE </p><p>SANCTIONS AND FUNDING CUTOFFS SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED </p><p>VIOLENCE ESCALATE, FURTHER WORSENING THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL. </p><p> </p><p>6.

THE LAST OCCURRED IN \'93/\'94, AND THE </p><p>GOOD RAINS OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS CANNOT REALISTICALLY BE EXPECTED </p><p>OR RELIED UPON FOR UPCOMING GROWING SEASONS.  THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS </p><p>OF A DROUGHT (WHICH CAN DROP TOTAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION BY 20 TO </p><p>40 PERCENT) ON TOP OF HITS CAUSED BY THE LAND INVASIONS AND SEIZURES </p><p>COULD CAUSE MASSIVE SHORTAGES.  THE COUNTRY, LIKE SO MANY OTHER </p><p>AFRICAN ONES, WOULD THEN REQUIRE MASSIVE FOOD AND HUMANITARIAN AID </p><p>FLOWS IF WIDESPREAD STARVATION IS TO AVOIDED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>MANUFACTURING AND THE SERVICES SECTOR ALSO UNDER SIEGE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MINING AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION CONTINUES TO DECLINE, DUE </p><p>TO UNABATED HIGH INTEREST AND INFLATION RATES, THE FUEL SHORTAGE, </p><p>AND THE DEBILITATING LACK OF FOREIGN CURRENCY NEEDED TO IMPORT NON- </p><p>DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED INPUTS OR EQUIPMENT.  IN THE LATTER AREA </p><p>STOCKS OF RAW MATERIAL PLUS THE CONTINUED LOYALTY OF EXTERNAL </p><p>SUPPLIERS HAVE KEPT THE PRIVATE SECTOR GOING DURING THE FIRST FOUR </p><p>MONTHS OF THE YEAR.  HOWEVER, THESE RESERVES ARE RUNNING OUT AND </p><p>DELIVERIES ARE SLOWING OR HALTING AS THE GOOD WILL RUNS OUT AND HARD </p><p>CURRENCY REMAINS UNAVAILABLE.  ALSO SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE CREDIT </p><p>PROVIDERS AND INSURERS WILL NOT UNDERWRITE RISK TO COVER EXPORTS TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE, FURTHER EXACERBATING THE SITUATION.  AS THE SHORTAGES HIT, </p><p>INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT WILL EXPERIENCE AN ACCELERATED DECLINE.  (OUR </p><p>MANUFACTURING CONTACTS TELL US THAT CRITICAL LEVELS ARE BEING </p><p>REACHED FOR PLASTIC FEEDSTOCKS, LIQUIFIED PETROLEUM GAS, ELECTRICAL </p><p>COMPONENTS, AND NUMEROUS CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS AND ADDITIVES.) </p><p>RETAIL SALES IN ALL PRODUCT AREAS ARE DOWN, AND TOURISM BOOKINGS ARE </p><p>OFF MASSIVELY DUE TO PRESS REPORTS OF THE FARM INVASIONS AND </p><p>VIOLENCE, AND THE FUEL SHORTAGE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02684  02 OF 04  190543Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE ZIMBABWE COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS ESTIMATES THAT THE </p><p>ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN HAS SO FAR THIS YEAR COST OVER 50,000 JOBS IN THE </p><p>FORMAL SECTOR ON EITHER A PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BASIS.  (THE LATTER </p><p>COVERS OPEN-ENDED LEAVE WHEN EMPLOYERS DO NOT FORMALLY LAYOFF THE </p><p>WORKER, OFTEN DUE TO THE SEVERANCE PACKAGE COSTS, EVEN THOUGH THE </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR A CALLBACK TO THE FACTORY OR PLANT ARE SLIM TO NONE.) </p><p>MANY LOCAL ECONOMISTS AND ANALYSTS ARE JUST NOW BEGINNING TO ACCEPT </p><p>THAT THIS YEAR\'S GOVERNMENT BUDGET DEFICIT MAY EASILY BE A SHOCKING </p><p>20 PERCENT (PREDICTED IN REF B A MONTH AGO).  WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT </p><p>THIS FIGURE COULD GROW, IF THE SLOWDOWN ACCELERATES AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>REVENUE COLLECTION SUFFERS FURTHER.  (SOURCES IN THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTRY TELL US THAT REVENUE COLLECTION IN THE FIRST QUARTER IS </p><p>DOWN AT LEAST 10 PERCENT FROM BUDGET.)  INCREASED VIOLENCE BETWEEN </p><p>NOW AND THE ELECTION WILL ONLY ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE, INCREASING </p><p>EMIGRATION BY COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND URBAN PROFESSIONALS, AND </p><p>FURTHER ALIENATING THE WEST. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) MAKING DEFENSIBLE, USEFUL PREDICTIONS OF ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>FUTURE IS AT THIS TIME NOT A USEFUL OR PRODUCTIVE TASK.

WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY ARREARS BOTH PRIVATE AND </p><p>PUBLIC ALREADY EXCEEDING ZIM $19 BILLION (OR AT LEAST U.S. $500 </p><p>MILLION), ANY DEVALUATION WILL INCREASE THE DEBT LOAD PLACED ON A </p><p>FALTERING ECONOMY AND MAKE INFLATION ALL THE HARDER TO BRING DOWN. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE LACK OF A DEVALUATION HAS MADE THE MAJORITY OF EXPORTS </p><p>UNPROFITABLE, AND IS A MAJOR FACTOR BEHIND THE HARD CURRENCY </p><p>SHORTAGE WITH ALL ITS DEBILITATING EFFECTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICIES AND ACTIONS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC FUTURE IS </p><p>WHAT ACTIONS AND POLICIES THE POST-ELECTION GOVERNMENT CHOOSES. </p><p>AFTER WHAT WILL BE NEARLY SIX MONTHS OF DRIFT AND INATTENTION, </p><p>TRIAGING THE ECONOMIC PATIENT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE HIGHEST </p><p>PRIORITIES.
