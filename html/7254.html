<p>UNCLAS SANAA 000690 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>INL FOR PAUL SIMONS, S/CT FOR COFER BLACK, DS FOR FRANK </p><p>TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN: ASSISTANCE FOR CIVIL DISORDER MANAGEMENT </p><p>(CDM) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) I am requesting your support for Civil Disorder </p><p>Management (CDM) training for Yemen.  There are at least </p><p>three salient considerations: </p><p> </p><p>--  Yemeni efforts against Al-Qa\'ida elements, especially </p><p>over the last eight months, have been sustained and </p><p>increasingly successful. </p><p>--  Despite President Salih\'s differences with us over Iraq </p><p>and the troubled regional climate, Salih has shown steady </p><p>resolve to protect American personnel and facitilies. </p><p>--  When push came to shove during the March 21 violent </p><p>demonstration heading toward the Embassy, Salih and Yemeni </p><p>security forces gave no sign of flinching, even when lethal </p><p>force had to be used. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) With my encouragement, staff here have been in </p><p>touch informally with INL and S/CT regarding training </p><p>possibilities.  Not surprisingly, FY-03 training budgets are </p><p>already earmarked, and indeed we are told FY-04 plans are </p><p>well advanced.  Sometimes plans fall through, however, and </p><p>countries are unable to participate in training programs </p><p>already approved.  Against that contingency, I would like to </p><p>express my strong support, as soon as possible, for a Civil </p><p>Disorder Management (CDM) Program for Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Such an INL-funded program would provide essential </p><p>in-country training for Central Security Organization </p><p>commanders, and follow-up training and essential equipment </p><p>for Central Security Organization (CSO -- the Ministry of </p><p>Interior\'s internal security body) cadres.  The violent March </p><p>21 demonstration showed clear need, and I cannot think of a </p><p>more appropriate response to the ROYG\'s efforts to ensure the </p><p>safety of this mission during the recent violence.  I am told </p><p>that training and equipment for about 150-175 personnel could </p><p>be done for an estimated $350,000. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) I recommend such a program be funded as early as </p><p>possible.  Informally, we have been in touch with senior </p><p>working levels at the MOI, who indicate strong interest in </p><p>training possiblities; if/if opportunities materialize,  On </p><p>that basis, Embassy would engage with the Minister of </p><p>Interior on necessary agreements to cover this activity </p><p>should a way forward be found for CDM for Yemen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
