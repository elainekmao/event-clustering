Gallagher for reasons 1.5 (c),(f),(g). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request; see para 4. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Post continues to seek information about the TSA </p><p>"no-fly list (ref. a)."  Our understanding from discussions </p><p>with TSA is that there is a written policy on the no-fly list </p><p>that describes, among other things, information that is to be </p><p>shared with foreign governments, and with U.S. and foreign </p><p>air carriers.  We also understand that TSA provides the </p><p>no-fly list itself to air carriers worldwide, to certain </p><p>Canadian government officials, and to certain U.S. agencies. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Several agencies at post deal regularly with Canadian </p><p>officials on matters related to terrorism and aviation </p><p>security policy and operations. In addition, the Department </p><p>of Homeland Security Bureau of Customs and Border Protection </p><p>(DHS/CBP) has approximately 400 inspectors serving as </p><p>preclearance officers at seven Canadian airports. </p><p>Preclearance inspectors have observed that, on occasion, </p><p>names that are on the no-fly list have not been found in the </p><p>Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS) widely used </p><p>by DHS/CBP inspectors. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Action Requests:  Please provide the policy on the </p><p>no-fly list.  We also request that no-fly lists be made </p><p>available on a regular and timely basis to DHS/CBP inspectors </p><p>and other appropriate USG personnel at the Embassy and other </p><p>locations in Canada. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
