<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 001196 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W (DEPSTEIN); AF/PD (AAMIRTHANAYAGAM); </p><p>ECA/A/E/AF (WBELL, AMARTIN, JCOTTON) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ABUJA FOR CPAO, CAO, CAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SCUL, CMGT, CVIS, SOCI, PGOV, EAID, ECON, EINV </p><p>SUBJECT: THE BIRTH OF PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES IN NIGERIA: </p><p>A NEW HOPE FOR THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM? </p><p> </p><p>Background: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Nigerian universities, once among the best in </p><p>Africa, deteriorated badly under 30 years of military </p><p>rule.  Nor was their plight alleviated during the last </p><p>four years of democratic governance.  They remain </p><p>overcrowded, poorly funded and decrepit. Currently, </p><p>there are 42 universities: 25 federal, 12 state, and 7 </p><p>private.   The universities are supervised by the </p><p>National Universities Commission (NUC), a coordinating </p><p>body that sets academic standards and allocates </p><p>budgets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Plagued by insufficient funds, student and faculty </p><p>strikes, and leadership crises, public universities are </p><p>in constant turmoil.  Students continually strike over </p><p>payment of small annual fees for housing and meals. </p><p>Faculty members protest late salary payments, poor </p><p>teaching conditions, and low budget allocations for </p><p>education (1.85 percent of the 2003 budget).  A 5-month </p><p>strike called by the academic staff union in December </p><p>is finally ending as universities gradually re-open. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A New Challenge to Universities: Student Cults </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.    Over the past decade, student cults have caused </p><p>a breakdown of law and order on university campuses and </p><p>are now endemic.  A perverted form of terrorism, </p><p>disruption seems to be their only goal.  Cultists </p><p>engage in murder, anarchy, arson, rape, and ritual </p><p>killings that often force universities to close. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   The Obasanjo Administration has cracked down on </p><p>cults, and several students, lecturers and  Vice- </p><p>Chancellors have been expelled or suspended for </p><p>participating in cult activities.  Anti-cultism </p><p>billboards are erected on every campus and in nearby </p><p>towns.  Students and community groups organize </p><p>theatrical productions and other public events to </p><p>campaign against cults. Still, the problem persists and </p><p>is one more challenge for public universities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Private Universities: An Alternative System in the </p><p>Making? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Five years ago, the NUC approved eight private </p><p>universities.  Supporters hailed their arrival as a </p><p>"renaissance" in higher education while critics saw </p><p>their existence as "cheapening and commercializing" </p><p>higher education in Nigeria.  Nonetheless, the </p><p>perennial disruption of public universities has made </p><p>private universities a much sought-after alternative </p><p>for parents and students. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Four of the five private universities are church - </p><p>affiliated, and all are located in southern Nigeria. </p><p>Predominantly Muslim northern Nigeria has yet to open a </p><p>private university although Heritage University in </p><p>Kaduna, sponsored by former military dictator General </p><p>Ibrahim Babangida, was one of the first private </p><p>universities approved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.    All but one of the universities offer moral </p><p>teachings along with academic courses and an emphasis </p><p>on community service.  These universities are much </p><p>better equipped than their public counterparts and more </p><p>advanced in technology, administration and academic </p><p>development.  They have plans for an annual meeting and </p><p>a joint sports and cultural festival.  Though gradually </p><p>increasing, enrollments in these private universities </p><p>represent less than one percent of the total population </p><p>of university students. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Tuition at private universities ranges between </p><p>$3,000 to $5,000 -- an enormous sum of money in a </p><p>country where the average annual income is $300. </p><p>Still, many wealthy parents, when unable to send their </p><p>children abroad, are now turning to private </p><p>universities as the only institutions where a student </p><p>can complete a Bachelor\'s degree in four years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.   The number of private universities may grow in the </p><p>  future.  On May 28, one day before the Obasanjo/Atiku </p><p>  inauguration, the NUC awarded a license to ABTI </p><p>  University in Adamawa, the home state of Vice President </p><p>  Atiku. Three additional universities are already </p><p>  approved, and applications for seven new universities </p><p>  are pending.  Thus, there are potentially ten new </p><p>  private universities that could eventually join the </p><p>  five currently operating universities. </p><p>9.   Following are brief descriptions of the private </p><p>universities currently functioning.  Note that the NUC </p><p>lists two other universities besides the following five </p><p>on its list: The Pan-African University, an extension </p><p>of the prominent Lagos Business School, yet to </p><p>officially open; and the Benson Idahosa University in </p><p>Benin City, about which PAS was unable to find </p><p>substantial information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Private Universities: A Description of the Big Five: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.   Igbinedion University in Edo State was the first </p><p>private university to be established.  It matriculated </p><p>the 3rd set of students (about 2000) in May 2003 and </p><p>plans to establish a Postgraduate School in the near </p><p>future.  Igbinedion\'s College of Medicine is the first </p><p>in a private university to be accredited by the Medical </p><p>and Dental Council of Nigeria.  In addition to its own </p><p>resources, the university receives financial support </p><p>from foreign individuals, organizations and </p><p>foundations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.   Bowen University in Osun State developed from the </p><p>Nigerian Baptist College(a teacher training institute). </p><p>Barely a year old, it has over 500 students and three </p><p>faculties. It is funded by the Nigerian Baptist </p><p>Convention and operates on a shoe - string budget.  It </p><p>has yet to establish substantial ties with Baptists </p><p>elsewhere.  Located in a rural Muslim community, Bowen </p><p>has been well received. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Babcock University in Ogun State is affiliated with </p><p>the Seventh Day Adventist church.  Like Bowen, it has </p><p>three major faculties.  But, it has more facilities, </p><p>courses and teaching faculty than Bowen.  Babcock has </p><p>established links with several local and international </p><p>foundations and agencies that have contributed </p><p>generously to its development. Founded in 1914 by </p><p>American Missionary David Babcock, Babcock is modeled </p><p>on American universities and has Nigeria\'s only known </p><p>work-study program.  Students run its highly developed </p><p>agricultural plantations, food services program and </p><p>maintain its attractive campus grounds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Madonna University of Science and Technology </p><p>in Anambra State is affiliated with the Catholic </p><p>church.  The Catholic faith is practiced by over 80% of </p><p>Nigerians in the East and dates back to the </p><p>establishment of Catholic churches, convents and </p><p>schools in the post-slave trade era.  Madonna is a </p><p>product of its regional surroundings, reflecting not </p><p>only the predominant religion but also the preference </p><p>of indigenes for technical and industrial subjects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Covenant University, just outside of Lagos, is </p><p>funded by Pentecostals.  The campus is built on </p><p>"CanaanLand" and attached to its enormous chapel. Like </p><p>the chapel, Covenant was built entirely by volunteer </p><p>labor and took only a year to construct.  Affiliated </p><p>with Oral Roberts University in the U.S., Covenant held </p><p>its first matriculation ceremony early this year and </p><p>has over a thousand students in three faculties and </p><p>twenty departments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Conclusion: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Whether or not they represent the future of </p><p>Nigerian higher education, a sort of Nigerian Ivy </p><p>League or just something entirely different, private </p><p>universities are on the rise and are attracting </p><p>international attention and support.  Right now, a </p><p>degree from the University of Ibadan or Amadou Bello </p><p>University is more prestigious than a degree from any </p><p>of the private universities.  However, if upheaval </p><p>continues in the public universities this may change. </p><p>Private universities are not perfect -- they have their </p><p>own administrative problems, and there is a report of </p><p>cultism at Babcock -- however, their emergence has been </p><p>a positive development in Nigerian higher education </p><p>that bears watching. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
