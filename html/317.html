<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 PANAMA 08545 </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, PM, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  PANAMANIANS HOPE FOR A SUCCESSFUL COUP </p><p>          -- NORIEGA PLANS FOR A NEW YEAR IN POWER </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>2.  THROUGHOUT 1989, RAPIDLY UNFOLDING POLITICAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS HELD OUT HOPE TO MANY PANAMANIANS FOR </p><p>A RESOLUTION TO PANAMA\'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>CRISIS:  THE ELECTION OF MAY 7, THE SUBSEQUENT OAS </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1, THE COUP ATTEMPT OF OCTOBER 3, AND </p><p>THE TREATY DEADLINE OF JANUARY 1, 1990. </p><p>PROJECTING INTO THE FIRST HALF OF 1990, NO SUCH </p><p>HOPEFUL EVENTS AND DATES ARE READILY APPARENT. </p><p>THE OPPOSITION\'S MAIN OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO SURVIVE </p><p>POLITICALLY, ECONOMICALLY, AND LITERALLY UNTIL THE </p><p>NEXT COUP.  NORIEGA WILL HAVE TO TRY AND </p><p>CONSOLIDATE HIS CONTROL OVER THE PANAMA DEFENSE </p><p>FORCES (FDP) AND AVOID ANOTHER UPRISING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PRESSURES ON NORIEGA HAVE INCREASED ACROSS THE </p><p>BOARD, BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE DETERMINED THAT HE CAN </p><p>MANAGE THEM.  DESPITE NEW U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, </p><p>THE MOST PRECIPITOUS ECONOMIC DROP IS OVER FOR </p><p>NOW, FOLLOWING A TWO-YEAR, 25 PERCENT DROP IN </p><p>GDP.  INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION REMAINS AN IRRITANT </p><p>TO THE REGIME, BUT IT IS NOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR </p><p>NORIEGA\'S STABILITY.  U.S. ACTIONS, FROM THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF AN ACTING CANAL ADMINISTRATOR TO </p><p>RUMORED COVERT PLANS AGAINST NORIEGA AS WELL AS </p><p>NEW ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, ALLOW NORIEGA TO BEAT THE </p><p>NATIONALISTIC DRUM AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF </p><p>DOMESTIC SUPPORT FOR HIM IS GROWING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  NORIEGA\'S WEAKEST POINT REMAINS HIS OWN </p><p>INSTITUTION.  WHISPERS THAT "THE OCTOBER 3 COUP IS </p><p>NOT OVER" CONTINUE AND NORIEGA CONTINUES TO HOLD </p><p>ON MAINLY BY BRUTAL REPRESSION OF ANY POTENTIAL </p><p>NEW INSIDE OPPONENTS.  WHEN ANOTHER ACTION TO </p><p>REMOVE NORIEGA WILL TAKE PLACE IS UNCERTAIN, BUT </p><p>WAITING FOR THAT POSSIBILITY IS THE MAIN PROSPECT </p><p>FOR PANAMA IN 1990.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>THE CRISIS GRINDS ON </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  THE PANAMA CRISIS CONTINUES TO GRIND ON WITH </p><p>NO CLEAR END IN SIGHT.  NORIEGA TENACIOUSLY HOLDS </p><p>ON TO POWER, INTIMIDATING HIS OPPONENTS AND FIRING </p><p>UP HIS SUPPORTERS WITH SLOGANS CALLING FOR </p><p>RETRIBUTION AGAINST "PANAMANIAN TRAITORS AND THEIR </p><p>U.S. MASTERS," SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HIM. </p><p>NORIEGA IS WEAKER THAN HE WAS AT THIS TIME LAST </p><p>YEAR, BUT THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT SET OF </p><p>PRESSURES HAVE SO FAR FAILED TO EJECT HIM FROM </p><p>OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  NEVERTHELESS, RECENT PRESS REPORTS OF AN </p><p>ALLEGED U.S. COVERT ACTION PLAN AGAINST NORIEGA </p><p>HAVE ONCE AGAIN RAISED HOPES OF SOME PANAMANIANS </p><p>THAT THIS MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF HIS END. </p><p>NORIEGA HIMSELF IS APPARENTLY ATTACHING SOME </p><p>CREDIBILITY TO THE PRESS REPORTS.  HE HAS REACTED </p><p>NERVOUSLY BY STEPPING UP HARASSMENT OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION AND INCREASING THE SIZE, TRAINING, </p><p>ACTIVITY, AND ARMAMENT OF HIS "DIGNITY </p><p>BATTALIONS."  THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP IS </p><p>CONCERNED OVER THE NEW "EYE FOR AN EYE" </p><p>PARA-MILITARY CAMPAIGN, WHICH NORIEGA HAS USED TO </p><p>REMIND THE OPPOSITION OF ITS VULNERABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>REGIME POLITICAL ACTIVITY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>7.  THE RODRIGUEZ ADMINISTRATION, UNSURPRISINGLY, </p><p>REMAINS INEFFECTUAL, BUT CONTINUES TO LIMP ALONG. </p><p>REGIME SOURCES INDICATE WITH SOME DEGREE OF </p><p>CERTITUDE THAT NORIEGA IS UNHAPPY WITH HIS </p><p>CIVILIAN PUPPETS, THAT HE MAY EVEN FIRE RODRIGUEZ, </p><p>AND PLANS TO TAKE OVER THE FORMAL REIGNS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT SOON.  THE ASSEMBLY OF 510 LOCAL </p><p>DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES (ANRC) CONFIRMED HIM AS </p><p>"NATIONAL COORDINATOR" ON NOVEMBER 22.  THIS </p><p>BRINGS HIM ONE STEP CLOSER TO BEING NAMED "HEAD OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT", WHICH HE AND OTHERS AROUND HIM HAVE </p><p>HINTED AT FOR SOME TIME. </p><p> </p><p>8.  MANY VIEW THIS NORIEGA MOVE AS THE FINAL STEP </p><p>TOWARD A TOTALITARIAN REGIME AND FURTHER SEVERE </p><p>REPRESSION.  SOME SEE THIS AS A PENDING NORIEGA </p><p>MISTAKE.  AS "HEAD OF GOVERNMENT", HE WOULD HAVE </p><p>TO BEAR FULL OFFICIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR REGIME </p><p>ACTIONS.  AT THE SAME TIME, BY INTRODUCING A NEW </p><p>ELEMENT -- HIS GOVERNMENTAL ROLE -- INTO THE STALE </p><p>POLITICAL SITUATION, NORIEGA MAY BE ABLE TO USE </p><p>HIS USUAL MIXTURE OF OBFUSCATION AND INTIMIDATION </p><p>TO BUY HIMSELF MORE TIME AND POLITICAL BREATHING </p><p>SPACE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>THE OPPOSITION </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>9.  NORIEGA\'S MOST RECENT PARA-MILITARY SHOW OF </p><p>FORCE FURTHER CONVINCED THE OPPOSITION THAT </p><p>POLITICAL ACTION WILL RESULT ONLY IN GREATER </p><p>REGIME BRUTALITY AGAINST THEM, NOT NORIEGA\'S </p><p>DEPARTURE.  THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP QUIETLY </p><p>HOPES THAT CLANDESTINE (AND OTHER) U.S. ACTION, </p><p>POSSIBLY COUPLED WITH ANOTHER COUP WILL REMOVE </p><p>NORIEGA.  THE LEADERS SEE THEMSELVES PLAYING A </p><p>ROLE IN THE NEXT COUP ATTEMPT AND THEIR CURRENT </p><p>PREPARATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON BEING ABLE TO MOVE IN </p><p>TO FILL THE GOVERNMENT VACUUM IF THE NEXT EFFORT </p><p>SHOULD SUCCEED.  THE CIVILIAN OPPOSITION </p><p>RECOGNIZES THE POLITICAL REALITY THAT THE MILITARY </p><p>IS THE MAIN POLITICAL FORCE IN PANAMA. </p><p> </p><p>10.  AS THE MEMORY -- AND TO SOME EXTENT THE </p><p>LEGITIMACY -- OF THE MAY ELECTION RECEDES, THE </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE LEADERSHIP FROM WITHIN THE </p><p>OPPOSITION RANKS "TO DO SOMETHING" TO MAINTAIN </p><p>POLITICAL LEGITIMACY IS GROWING, HOWEVER. </p><p>OPPOSITION ABILITY TO CULTIVATE POLITICAL SUPPORT </p><p>AND TRUST IN THE ADOC LEADERSHIP ARE HAMPERED BY </p><p>EFFECTIVE NORIEGA INTIMIDATION AT THE GRASS ROOTS </p><p>LEVEL.  MEANWHILE, U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ARE </p><p>CONTINUING TO HURT AND NEW MEASURES ARE </p><p>UNPOPULAR.  THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP FEARS THAT </p><p>MANY PANAMANIANS -- INCLUDING THEIR FOLLOWERS -- </p><p>WILL INCREASINGLY DEMAND THAT THE AMERICANS GET </p><p>OFF THEIR BACKS, IF NORIEGA WON\'T. </p><p> </p><p>11.  PANAMA\'S OPPOSITION AND PANAMANIANS IN </p><p>GENERAL RAN UP MANY SHORT TERM HILLS IN 1989 - </p><p>WITH THE END ALWAYS JUST OVER THE HORIZON.  MAY </p><p>ELECTIONS, THE OAS NEGOTIATIONS, SEPTEMBER 1, </p><p>OCTOBER 3, AND NOW JANUARY 1, 1990 HAVE ALL TOO </p><p>EASILY BEEN ACCEPTED AS TARGETS FOR WHEN THE </p><p>PANAMA CRISIS WOULD "HAVE TO" BE SOLVED.  ALREADY </p><p>ADOC LEADER GUILLERMO "BILLY" FORD IS TALKING OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 25 (NICARAGUAN ELECTION DAY) AS A DATE </p><p>BEFORE WHICH NORIEGA MUST FALL IF THE U.S. DOES </p><p>NOT WISH TO HAVE THE PRECEDENT OF AN ANNULLED </p><p>ELECTION REPEATED IN NICARAGUA .  OVERALL, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE OPPOSITION HAS LITTLE ENERGY LEFT TO </p><p>CHARGE UP ANOTHER HILL UNLESS CONVINCED IT IS THE </p><p>LAST ONE.  ONLY ANOTHER COUP HOLDS OUT SUCH A </p><p>PROMISE, BUT THE OPPOSITION IS NOT ABLE TO </p><p>INFLUENCE THAT TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>THE NEXT COUP ATTEMPT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>12.  THE MOST (AND MAYBE ONLY) HOPEFUL SIGN FOR </p><p>NORIEGA\'S OPPONENTS IN 1990 IS THAT TROUBLES </p><p>INSIDE THE FDP ARE WORSE THAN THEY HAVE EVER </p><p>BEEN.  REASSIGNMENTS AND PROMOTIONS FLOWING FROM </p><p>THE POST-COUP PURGE ARE JUST NOW BEING MADE -- </p><p>MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AFTER THE EVENT.  MANY OF THE </p><p>MORE "PROFESSIONAL" FDP OFFICERS AND NCO\'S WERE </p><p>KILLED, TORTURED, OR DISMISSED AFTER OCTOBER 3. </p><p>THE SUCCESSOR CROP OF TRUE BELIEVERS HAS NEITHER </p><p>THE EXPERIENCE, TRAINING OR INTELLIGENCE TO FILL </p><p>THE SHOES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS.  NORIEGA HAS HAD </p><p>TO RELY MAINLY ON HIMSELF OR THE SUPPORT OF THIS </p><p>SMALL CLIQUE OF LOYALISTS SINCE THE COUP ATTEMPT. </p><p>HIS INCREASED USE OF DIGNITY BATTALIONS IS ALSO </p><p>WEARING ON THE CAREER SOLDIERS.  WHAT LITTLE </p><p>MILITARY PRIDE THEY HAVE LEFT HAS BEEN INJURED BY </p><p>THE ACTIVITIES OF THIS PARA-MILITARY RABBLE WHICH </p><p>THEY FEAR WILL GET OUT OF CONTROL AND ULTIMATELY </p><p>HURT THE INSTITUTION.  WITH THE DIGNITY BATTALIONS </p><p>AND OTHER IRREGULARS OVER 2000 IN NUMBER THE IMAGE </p><p>OF A COMPETING PARA-MILITARY FORCE IS BEGINNING TO </p><p>ARISE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  DISCONTENT AND FEELINGS OF REVENGE CONTINUE </p><p>TO FESTER INSIDE THE FDP AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS </p><p>REPORTS THAT THERE ARE "INDIVIDUALS" WHO ARE </p><p>PREPARED TO ACT ON THESE EMOTIONS.  ONE REGIME </p><p>INSIDER RECENTLY CLAIMED THAT NORIEGA\'S NOMINAL </p><p>NUMBER 2, COLONEL MARCO JUSTINES, IS HIMSELF </p><p>LOOKING FOR WAYS TO INCH OUT HIS BOSS.  MEANWHILE, </p><p>NOTORIOUS CIVILIAN SUPPORTERS OF NORIEGA, SUCH AS </p><p>MARIO ROGNONI AND ISAAC HANONO (STRICTLY PROTECT), </p><p>ARE ALREADY LOOKING BEYOND NORIEGA\'S DEPARTURE IN </p><p>ADVOCATING WITH EMBOFFS AN OPPOSITION DECLARATION </p><p>OF AMNESTY FOR REGIME SUPPORTERS.  SOURCES NOW </p><p>INDICATE THAT NORIEGA SUSPECTS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO </p><p>UNSEAT HIM AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 15. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>THE STATUS OF "UNRELENTING PRESSURES" </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL </p><p>------------- </p><p>14.  THE RECENT RESOLUTION OF THE OASGA CONFIRMED </p><p>NORIEGA\'S ISOLATION IN THE HEMISPHERE, BUT WAS MET </p><p>WITH ONLY FLEETING INTEREST IN PANAMA.  THE FDP\'S </p><p>DISINVITATION TO THE RECENT CONFERENCE OF THE </p><p>AMERICAN ARMIES IN GUATEMALA WAS POTENTIALLY A </p><p>MORE SERIOUS BLOW TO FDP MORALE, BUT THIS COLD </p><p>SHOULDER FROM THEIR LATIN COLLEAGUES PASSED </p><p>LARGELY UNNOTICED BECAUSE OF NORIEGA\'S ABSOLUTE </p><p>CONTROL OF INFORMATION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE HIS </p><p>INSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>15.  AMBASSADORS OF MOST NATIONS REMAIN OUTSIDE </p><p>PANAMA, EITHER ON VACATION OR CONSULTATIONS, BUT </p><p>LOCAL DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION MAY BE IN DANGER.  THE </p><p>FRENCH AMBASSADOR RECENTLY RETURNED FROM HIS </p><p>"VACATION" TO REJOIN HIS ITALIAN AND SPANISH </p><p>COLLEAGUES WHO NEVER LEFT.  SEVERAL AMBASSADORS </p><p>AND MILITARY ATTACHES (E.G. MEXICO) MAY VISIT </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES WHICH ARE RESIDING HERE AT </p><p>CHRISTMAS.  NORIEGA IS MAKING ALL HE CAN OUT OF </p><p>CONTACTS WITH THE USSR, THE PRC, LIBYA, CUBA, </p><p>NICARAGUA, AND EVEN U.S. ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>GROUPS.  HE WILL ALSO SEEK TO CONJURE UP SOME </p><p>LIMITED LEGITIMACY IN HIS PLEA FOR LATIN </p><p>SOLIDARITY OVER THE CANAL ADMINISTRATOR ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC </p><p>-------- </p><p>16.  THE REGIME CONTINUES TO HAVE CASH FLOW </p><p>PROBLEMS, BUT THE ECONOMIC DOWNWARD SPIRAL HAS </p><p>LEVELED OFF FOR NOW.  NORIEGA IS ABLE TO COMBAT </p><p>THE WORST DISRUPTIONS BY SALARY ADJUSTMENTS AND </p><p>CONTINUED GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT OF LOYALISTS. </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT OVERALL IS ON THE RISE, BUT ONE OF </p><p>THE "PILLARS" OF THE PANAMANIAN SERVICE ECONOMY -- </p><p>THE COLON FREE ZONE -- IS HAVING RECORD SALES AND </p><p>PROVIDES SOMEWHAT INCREASING EMPLOYMENT IN THE </p><p>POLITICALLY VOLATILE COLON AREA. </p><p> </p><p>17.  MEANWHILE, PARA-MILITARY DIGNITY BATTALIONS </p><p>ARE ENLISTING OR SCARING THE UNEMPLOYED. </p><p>BUSINESSMEN, HURT BY NORIEGA AND U.S. SANCTIONS, </p><p>ARE INCREASINGLY MORE LIKELY TO MOVE TOWARD </p><p>ACCOMMODATION WITH NORIEGA.  MANY FEEL THEY HAVE </p><p>TO GIVE PRIORITY TO BEING ABLE TO STAY IN BUSINESS. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. PRESSURES </p><p>-------------- </p><p>18.  FURTHER U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS HEIGHTEN THE </p><p>SENSE OF CRISIS IN PANAMA, CREATING THE PARADOX OF </p><p>REGIME-OPPOSITION-CHURCH AGREEMENT IN OPPOSING </p><p>THEM.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE U.S. PORT BAN FOR </p><p>PANAMANIAN FLAGGED VESSELS AND THE APPOINTMENT OF </p><p>A TEMPORARY CANAL ADMINISTRATOR CREATE NEW </p><p>PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR NORIEGA.  BANNING </p><p>PANAMANIAN FLAGGED VESSELS FROM THE U.S. WILL ROB </p><p>NORIEGA AND HIS CRONIES OF A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT </p><p>OF INCOME.  SOME OF THE LATTER MAY EVEN JUMP SHIP </p><p>AND TURN ON HIM.  BUT IN THE END RESULT, MANY MORE </p><p>MAY REALIZE THAT IT WAS THEY WHO DEPENDED ON HIM, </p><p>NOT HE ON THEM. </p><p> </p><p>19.  THE CANAL ADMINISTRATOR APPOINTMENT OFFERS </p><p>NORIEGA SOME ADDITIONAL NATIONALISTIC PEGS TO </p><p>SUPPORT HIS SEARCH FOR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SUPPORT.  BLOWING THE TREATY VIOLATION AND </p><p>NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WHISTLE MAY WELL GAIN HIM </p><p>SOME SUPPORT.  PLAYED WELL, HE MAY AGAIN BE ABLE </p><p>TO DO WHAT HE DOES BEST:  BUY TIME. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE FUTURE OF THE PANAMA CRISIS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>20.  DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPPOSITION TO NORIEGA IS </p><p>SHOWING SIGNS OF FATIGUE.  FOREIGN ATTENTION IN </p><p>PARTICULAR IS DISTRACTED BY MUCH HIGHER PROFILE </p><p>REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EVENTS, FROM EL </p><p>SALVADOR TO BERLIN.  OF COURSE, NORIEGA TOO IS </p><p>TIRING, EXEMPLIFIED IN HIS SLOWNESS IN SETTLING </p><p>THE TURMOIL INSIDE HIS OWN INSTITUTION.  BUT HE IS </p><p>A MASTER OF SURVIVAL AND ABLE TO BUILD ON THE </p><p>FATIGUE OF OTHERS.  RENEWED NOISES IN RECENT </p><p>REGIME PRONOUNCEMENTS OF A WILLINGNESS TO "TALK" </p><p>ARE A CLASSIC MANIFESTATION OF TRIED AND TRUE </p><p>NORIEGA TIME-BUYING TACTICS. </p><p> </p><p>21.  THE POLITICAL TENSION IN PANAMA, INCREASED BY </p><p>RECENT PRESS REVELATIONS AND U.S. SANCTIONS </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENTS, WILL LIKELY EBB IN EARLY 1990, </p><p>ABSENT SOME MAJOR EVENT.  NORIEGA IS SHOWING NO </p><p>SIGNS THAT HE HAS ANY INTENTION OF LEAVING </p><p>VOLUNTARILY.  GIVEN BROAD POLITICAL REALITIES IN </p><p>THIS COUNTRY, THE ONLY HOPE FOR A FIRST STEP IN </p><p>CRISIS RESOLUTION IS ANOTHER COUP.  WAITING FOR </p><p>THAT TO HAPPEN IS THE MAIN POLITICAL PROSPECT FOR </p><p>PANAMA IN 1990. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BUSHNELL </p><p></p></div>
