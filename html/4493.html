(C) Summary and comment:  Embassy has long emphasized to </p><p>the GOT the importance of a rapid and fair settlement to the </p><p>pending BOT/TOR projects, which still have not been resolved </p><p>(reftels).  It now appears the GOT is considering </p><p>re-negotiation of the contracts for the BOT projects that are </p><p>already in operation, including U.S.-owned companies Trakya </p><p>Elektrik (Enron) and Doga Enerji (Edison Mission).  Trakya </p><p>and Doga have filed suit against the government, claiming </p><p>that recently announced regulations are in violation of their </p><p>contracts, and are intended to force the companies to lower </p><p>their prices.  As we engage the new government on economic </p><p>matters, we will couple our support for their overall energy </p><p>liberalization efforts with an emphasis on the importance of </p><p>contract sanctity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Existing BOT Projects Fear Contracts Will Be Reopened </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A year after being established, the Energy Market </p><p>Regulatory Authority (EMRA) is still grappling with how to </p><p>handle the pending build-operate-transfer (BOT) and </p><p>transfer-of-operating rights (TOR) energy projects. </p><p>Unfortunately, EMRA is also now reevaluating the six BOT </p><p>projects that are already in operation, which include the </p><p>U.S.-owned, OPIC-financed energy companies Trakya Elektrik </p><p>(Enron) and Doga Enerji (Edison Mission).  (Note:  Enron\'s </p><p>share in Trakya Elektrik is reportedly being sold by the </p><p>bankruptcy court in the U.S. on November 22). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Trakya Elektrik and Doga Enerji filed suit against </p><p>EMRA on October 3, claiming that the electricity market </p><p>regulations released by EMRA in August constitute a breach of </p><p>their implementation contracts.  The companies have requested </p><p>an injunction on implementation of those articles of the </p><p>regulations that could ultimately affect their contracts. </p><p>For example, the new regulations require all companies -- </p><p>even those already in operation -- to apply for operating </p><p>licenses.  The new regulation also stipulates that companies </p><p>must adhere to all existing and future changes to the </p><p>regulations, which Trakya and Doga claim opens their </p><p>contracts to unilateral modifications. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Although EMRA President Yusuf Gunay told us the </p><p>requirement for existing operators to apply for a license is </p><p>a "formality," the BOT companies see it as a means for EMRA </p><p>to reopen negotiations on the prices in the contracts. </p><p>Various GOT officials have long claimed that the BOT prices </p><p>for electricity are too high.  (Note:  the BOTs are charging </p><p>in the range of 10-12 cents per kilowatt hour.  In </p><p>comparison, the new Intergen BO plants charge in the range of </p><p>4-6 cents per kilowatt hour.  End note.)  The BOT companies </p><p>argue that their prices accurately reflect the level of risk </p><p>and higher costs they faced when they signed the contracts in </p><p>1993, and when they built the plants in the late 1990s. </p><p>However, the companies assert (correctly, in our view), </p><p>whether or not the GOT believes the prices are too high, the </p><p>fact remains that these are the prices stipulated in the </p><p>contracts signed by the GOT after years of negotiation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Conversations with EMRA\'s legal advisor and others </p><p>indicate that Trakya and Doga\'s suspicions that EMRA will </p><p>reopen their contracts are not unfounded.  Ali Ulusoy, a </p><p>university law professor, heads an independent commission </p><p>enlisted by EMRA to provide recommendations on how to manage </p><p>the roughly 100 pending and existing BOT, BO, and TOR </p><p>projects as Turkey liberalizes its energy market.  Ulusoy </p><p>emphasized to econoff that he believes the existing BOTs must </p><p>reduce their prices, claiming that "otherwise we will not be </p><p>able to move to a liberalized market."  Ulusoy stated that </p><p>the BOT companies should be "willing to renegotiate" prices </p><p>in the interest of supporting a free energy market in Turkey, </p><p>which in the long-term should provide companies with more </p><p>opportunities.  Responding to econoff\'s point that Turkey </p><p>would likely pay in terms of decreased FDI if potential </p><p>investors concluded that the GOT did not honor its contracts, </p><p>Ulusoy responded that Turkey had "no other option" if it </p><p>wanted to achieve a free energy market in the next several </p><p>years. </p><p>6. (C) The General Manager of Uni-Mar, one of the non-U.S. </p><p>BOT companies, told econoff it was clear that EMRA\'s </p><p>intention was to force the BOTs to cut their prices.  He said </p><p>that even if there was room for some "flexibility" on the </p><p>price issue, contractually the companies were under no </p><p>obligation to renegotiate with the GOT.  For this reason, </p><p>Uni-Mar joined Trakya Elektrik and Doga in their October 3 </p><p>lawsuits.  TETTAS General Manager Hayrettin Yildirim also </p><p>told econoff the GOT wanted the BOTs to cut their prices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, No Progress on Pending BOT/TOR Projects </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) As reported Ref A, there has been no progress toward </p><p>resolution of the pending BOT/TOR projects since former </p><p>Ministers Cakan and Dervis committed in May to settle all </p><p>pending signed contracts as soon as possible.  As of </p><p>September 3, when the electricity market law went into force, </p><p>EMRA took over responsibility for settling these projects. </p><p>EMRA President Yusuf Gunay recently told emboffs he is still </p><p>working on a strategy for managing the pending BOT/TOR </p><p>contracts, noting that he believes EMRA should act as a </p><p>"mediator" between the signators of the contracts, i.e. the </p><p>companies and the Ministry of Energy.  However, Gunay, as </p><p>well as legal advisor Ulusoy, made clear that the companies </p><p>must be flexible on the issues of price and treasury </p><p>guarantees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Role of the New Government </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The AK party announced in its "emergency action plan" </p><p>on November 16 that it would complete the pending TOR </p><p>projects within one year.  According to several GOT and </p><p>energy company officials, this policy is being driven by Afif </p><p>Demirkiran, newly-elected AK parliamentarian and former </p><p>General Manager of three of the pending TOR projects.  Some </p><p>company representatives believe the election of Demirkiran </p><p>bodes well for the BOT projects as well, since it would be </p><p>difficult for the government to treat the BOT and TOR </p><p>projects differently.  AK\'s emergency action plan also calls </p><p>for opening the energy market to competetion and cutting </p><p>electricity prices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Turkish Electricity Trade and Contracting Company </p><p>(TETTAS) General Manager Hayrettin Yildirim told econoff </p><p>November 20 that Minister of Energy Guler had asked senior </p><p>MENR officials for their recommendations on energy-related </p><p>issues.  Yildirim, who previously headed Treasury\'s foreign </p><p>investment office, had recommended the new government </p><p>immediately announce its intention to honor all existing </p><p>contracts, arguing that to do otherwise would do untold </p><p>damage to Turkey\'s foreign investment climate.  Yildirim said </p><p>his argument should resonate with the new minister, since it </p><p>was actually in the interest of TETTAS -- which purchases </p><p>electricity from the BOTs -- for the government to </p><p>renegotiate the prices of the existing BOT projects and not </p><p>to implement the pending BOT/TOR contracts.  Yildirim said </p><p>the electricity from the six operational BOTs comprised about </p><p>11 percent of all of TETTAS\' electricity purchases.  Although </p><p>the prices may be high by 2-3 cents per kilowatt hour, he </p><p>estimated the total extra cost to the government (if it </p><p>honored the contracts) would only be about USD 200 million. </p><p>Yildirim said that was a small price to pay to avoid </p><p>companies going to international arbitration and discouraging </p><p>potential investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  We have long emphasized to the GOT the importance of </p><p>honoring its contracts; however, our focus has been primarily </p><p>on the pending BOT/TOR projects (reftels).  It appears that </p><p>some officials are now considering re-opening the contracts </p><p>of the BOT projects that are already in operation.  We agree </p><p>with AK that electricity is relatively expensive in Turkey; </p><p>however, high prices are not only a result of the BOT plants </p><p>-- the high price BOTAS pays and charges for gas, inefficient </p><p>distribution networks, and low bill collection rates also </p><p>play an important role.  Although it is not yet clear how AK </p><p>intends to handle the pending or existing energy projects, we </p><p>will emphasize to the new government that, while the U.S. </p><p>supports establishment of a free energy market in Turkey, the </p><p>GOT cannot expect to attract more foreign investment unless </p><p>it honors its existing contracts, or adequately compensates </p><p>investors when it cannot do so.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
