<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 BRASILIA 002233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR SCRONIN, KLEZNY </p><p>DEPT FOR E:ALARSON; WHA:CSTRUBLE, SPINKHAM; EB:BMANOGUE </p><p>NSC FOR JOANNA WALLACE </p><p>USDA FOR JBPENN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, BR, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) </p><p>SUBJECT: WHAT\'S BEHIND BRAZIL\'S FTAA POLICY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Janice Fair, Economic Officer for Reason Section 1.5 (b) </p><p> and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The description that follows of the political and </p><p>economic factors helping to shape Brazil\'s trade policy, and </p><p>specifically its approach to the FTAA negotiations, is </p><p>offered to assist U.S. policymakers in determining whether </p><p>and how enough common ground can be found to conclude the </p><p>FTAA process successfully. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary and introduction.  A number of concurrent </p><p>forces are moving Brazil along its present FTAA trajectory. </p><p>These forces, or considerations for formulating policy, are </p><p>sometimes contradictory and may have led to some GOB </p><p>miscalculation on how best to achieve Brazil\'s interests </p><p>within the FTAA as well as the degree of hemispheric support </p><p>it would receive for its ideas to restructure the </p><p>negotiations.   Brazil\'s political goals, which include a </p><p>leadership role in South America along with a strong focus on </p><p>development and the social agenda, sometimes clash in its </p><p>pursuit of certain national economic interests.  However, the </p><p>GOB\'s vision of a reformulated FTAA is solidly rooted in its </p><p>perception of national interest and of the outcome required </p><p>for Brazil to benefit from the FTAA.  The newly-elaborated </p><p>three-track approach is not simply a negotiating ploy. </p><p>Brazil\'s FTAA calculation has always differed from that of </p><p>other countries in the hemisphere.  For Brazil, the bottom </p><p>line is improved access to the U.S. market for its </p><p>agricultural and industrial goods, not regional rules for </p><p>attracting foreign direct investment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Despite Brazil\'s strong desire to secure improved </p><p>access to the U.S. market, the rigid perspective of Itamaraty </p><p>officials in charge of FTAA policy inclines us to take at </p><p>face value the GOB claim that it will not continue with the </p><p>across the board FTAA negotiations as originally envisioned </p><p>and currently structured.  We also suspect that the GOB is </p><p>currently in a vulnerable stage in its FTAA policy, given the </p><p>substantial general rebuff of the Mercosul three-track </p><p>proposal that occurred during the Trade Negotiating Committee </p><p>(TNC) meeting in San Salvador July 8-11. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Regis Arslanian, unofficially Itamaraty\'s new policy </p><p>director for the FTAA and Mercosul-EU negotiations, has </p><p>suggested privately that a compromise would be possible </p><p>between Mercosul\'s three-track proposal and a baseline </p><p>agreement that he understood the USG to have contemplated </p><p>(septel).  According to Arslanian, a bilateral structure for </p><p>all market access negotiations is the key element for Brazil. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) As the GOB evaluates potential benefits of an FTAA, </p><p>assesses the current status of negotiations, and develops </p><p>proposals to move the negotiations more in line with its </p><p>perceived interests, we believe the following chief factors </p><p>impact its deliberations: </p><p> </p><p>* Brazil\'s desire to be a regional political leader and, in </p><p>particular, to be the driving force behind Mercosul\'s </p><p>reinvigoration. </p><p> </p><p>* The belief that some Brazilian producers are not </p><p>sufficiently competitive to benefit from and in fact could </p><p>lose through a free trade agreement at this time. </p><p> </p><p>* The recognition that Brazil needs substantial expansion of </p><p>exports to attain the economic growth necessary to address </p><p>its social agenda. </p><p> </p><p>*The belief that exports to the United States will continue </p><p>to grow anyway. </p><p> </p><p>* The concern that rules within comprehensive trade </p><p>agreements may constrain the GOB\'s ability to design its own </p><p>preferred economic development policies. </p><p> </p><p>* The difficulty in convincing the public and Congress that </p><p>an FTAA agreement would be a net positive for Brazil. </p><p> </p><p>* The existence of divisions and opposition within society </p><p>and government alike on the direction of Brazil\'s FTAA policy. </p><p> </p><p>LEADER OF SOUTH AMERICAN INTEGRATION </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The dominant theme in President Lula\'s foreign policy </p><p>has been Brazil\'s role as the natural leader of South </p><p>American integration, with Mercosul as the cornerstone.  Lula </p><p>has met almost every South American counterpart at least once </p><p>in the six months since taking office.  Press reports that </p><p>follow such meetings are replete with declarations of </p><p>solidarity, including references to the need to forge common </p><p>positions within the FTAA and WTO against developed country </p><p>protectionism.  Brazil has used the granting of BNDES credit </p><p>lines to Argentina, Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia and Peru to </p><p>reinforce these regional ties and fidelity to Brazil. </p><p>However, the GOB may have taken the rhetoric too seriously, </p><p>confusing no-cost statements of support in public </p><p>declarations with substantive positions within negotiations. </p><p>Despite Brazil\'s efforts to forge closer alliances with </p><p>countries in the region, it appears that Mercosul\'s </p><p>(Brazil\'s) proposal to reformulate the FTAA was roundly </p><p>rebuffed in the San Salvador TNC meeting. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) President Kirchner\'s election in Argentina has </p><p>apparently provided Brazil with a like-minded partner to make </p><p>Mercosul a priority.  However, Mercosul remains more </p><p>important as a political project than an economic one, and at </p><p>times Brazil\'s political interests regarding Mercosul appear </p><p>to blind it to its own economic interests.  Virtually all </p><p>Brazilians now recognize that the Mercosul market is </p><p>insufficient to provide the export growth Brazil needs. </p><p> </p><p>BRAZIL COST - LACK OF COMPETITIVENESS </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Rather than drawing attention to the new opportunities </p><p>that a hemisphere-wide trade agreement could present, the </p><p>FTAA generates fear in Brazil: the widespread perception that </p><p>many Brazilian industries cannot compete effectively, at </p><p>least not yet.  Although developed country protectionism is </p><p>always cited as a major problem undermining Brazil\'s </p><p>competitiveness, so are internal problems sometimes called </p><p>the "Brazil cost,"  i.e., high costs associated with Brazil\'s </p><p>tax structure, outdated social security system, labor code, </p><p>poor education, and, in general, bureaucratic obstacles to </p><p>commerce.  While the GOB is committed to social security and </p><p>tax reform, it seems to lack faith it can lower the "Brazil </p><p>cost" sufficiently in the near term to guarantee Brazilian </p><p>competitiveness in the free trade environment an FTAA </p><p>agreement would create. </p><p> </p><p>EXPORTS ARE ESSENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The GOB sees export growth as essential for economic </p><p>growth and job creation.  The GOB is still following tight </p><p>fiscal and monetary policies designed to control the </p><p>inflation that started to accelerate following last year\'s 30 </p><p>percent devaluation of the Real.  Foreign direct investment </p><p>has fallen off and capital in-flows have not recouped </p><p>following last year\'s financial uncertainties.  Exports grew </p><p>at a record pace at the beginning of this year, but are </p><p>expected to taper off somewhat with a strengthened currency. </p><p>Although the FTAA is a trade negotiation among 34 countries, </p><p>the GOB has stated clearly that its primary interest is </p><p>access to the U.S. market for goods.  Thus there is a strong </p><p>incentive for Brazil-led Mercosul to stick with the FTAA if </p><p>it is clear that achieving a trade agreement with the United </p><p>States outside the FTAA is highly unlikely. </p><p> </p><p>EXPORTS HAVE BEEN GROWING </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Although seeking improved access to the U.S. market </p><p>is a high GOB priority, some Brazilians note that exports to </p><p>the United States continue to grow anyway, even without a </p><p>trade agreement.  The United States is Brazil\'s largest </p><p>export market, and officials cite growth in exports to the </p><p>United States in each of the last seven years as evidence of </p><p>a trend.  Although the GOB wants to negotiate increased </p><p>access to the U.S. market through the FTAA, it is unlikely </p><p>that Brazil would choose to do so at any cost. </p><p> </p><p>FREEDOM TO PURSUE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  While aggressively seeking increased access to </p><p>foreign markets to allow for economic development through </p><p>export growth, the GOB is hesitant to enter into </p><p>comprehensive trade negotiations -- for example, those that </p><p>include rules on services, investment and government </p><p>procurement -- due to fear that these might constrain its </p><p>ability to develop new economic development policies.  Such </p><p>thinking was reflected in the GOB proposals in late 2002 to </p><p>changes the WTO TRIMS agreement to, among others, allow </p><p>performance requirements for investors, and again in </p><p>Brazil/Mercosul\'s FTAA goods market access offer that </p><p>included provisions to protect infant industries.  Although </p><p>not wishing to go all the way back to the inward-looking </p><p>policies of the sixties, the GOB does appear more concerned </p><p>about maintaining its freedom of action than about </p><p>establishing better hemispheric-wide rules for economic </p><p>activity. </p><p> </p><p>FTAA A HARD SELL </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Hand-wringing about the FTAA is a daily staple in the </p><p>Brazilian press, creating a constant sense of pressure and </p><p>urgency.  There isn\'t a single day when articles speculating </p><p>about FTAA policy do not appear in the major Brazilian </p><p>dailies, and reporting in smaller newspapers and magazines on </p><p>the subject is also prolific.  Past rhetoric by Lula and his </p><p>PT party helped create this hostile climate, and the GOB has </p><p>increased public doubt and confusion through its own </p><p>often-conflicting statements.  The result has limited the </p><p>GOB\'s maneuverability and intensified the leadership </p><p>challenge it faces in winning domestic approval for any </p><p>agreement. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Opposition to the FTAA is not new in Brazil. </p><p>Although industries worry about the "Brazil cost" and their </p><p>own specific competitive aspects, and labor organizations are </p><p>fearful about employment repercussions and loss of union </p><p>leadership, the arguments of the most vocal opponents are </p><p>usually ideological.  The emphasis that Lula and Itamaraty </p><p>have given under the Lula administration to communication </p><p>with civil society, both domestically and through FTAA </p><p>hemisphere-wide fora, underscores the GOB\'s real concern </p><p>about garnering public support for the FTAA. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) We believe that concern about deep-seated domestic </p><p>opposition to an FTAA deal is behind Mercosul\'s recent </p><p>proposal to allow participation of private sector and </p><p>legislative representatives in its official FTAA delegations. </p><p> In contrast to other countries\' concerns about </p><p>confidentiality and the inflexibility that an expanded </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>delegation composition might introduce into the negotiations, </p><p>Brazil apparently sees direct participation by these groups </p><p>as a means of gaining their approval for any eventual </p><p>agreement. The GOB may also be pushing for a bilateral </p><p>structure for market access because it would be simpler to </p><p>explain the trade-offs that were made to reach agreement. </p><p>Similarly, for Itamaraty a "positive list"  approach for </p><p>services and investment market access makes it easier to </p><p>convey details on concessions to labor leaders and other </p><p>social and political leaders. </p><p> </p><p>NOT EVERYONE AGREES WITH ITAMARATY POLICY </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) There has been a recent consolidation of power within </p><p>Itamaraty, first with the replacement of Ambassador Hugueney </p><p>and now with the replacement of Ambassador Simas, of a group </p><p>that has viewed the FTAA skeptically for years.  By all </p><p>accounts, the driving force behind current Itamaraty policy </p><p>is the Secretary-General, Pinheiro Guimaraes.  He has been </p><p>among the Brazilian observers who have for years portrayed an </p><p>FTAA deal as at worst as a project of the United States to </p><p>take over the Brazilian economy and at best as a necessary </p><p>evil. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C)  However, not everyone within the diplomatic corps </p><p>nor within the government agrees with Itamaraty\'s current </p><p>FTAA policy.  Within other ministries, including the </p><p>ministries of Agriculture, Development and Finance, there is </p><p>concern that Itamaraty\'s minimalist approach does not take </p><p>proper account of the potential economic benefits to be </p><p>gained through the FTAA.  Nonetheless, Itamaraty has been put </p><p>in charge of coordinating FTAA policymaking, and we do not </p><p>believe efforts to exploit differences among ministers would </p><p>be successful.  Attempts to stir the pot in this way would </p><p>likely only stiffen hardliners and undermine like-minded </p><p>ministers. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) As the GOB reflects on its next step(s) given the </p><p>lack of support for Mercosul\'s three-track proposal, we </p><p>believe it will see its scope for movement as very limited. </p><p>After so publicly arguing for this approach, the GOB will </p><p>have a hard time abandoning it.  Some in the GOB may harbor a </p><p>sense of being misled, since they took Ambassador Zoellick\'s </p><p>presentations in Brasilia in May as an invitation to engage </p><p>in a dialog about reformulation of the FTAA.  Arslanian, for </p><p>example, said the Brazilian delegation in El Salvador was </p><p>disappointed that the U.S. side made no mention there of a </p><p>"baseline" approach. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) There are intense political and social pressures for </p><p>Brazil to step back from the broad-based FTAA negotiations as </p><p>currently configured.  Should the GOB fail to obtain </p><p>structural changes in the negotiations, Brazil is likely to </p><p>simply go through the motions with the FTAA, refraining from </p><p>constructive participation.  Eventually it might even feel </p><p>compelled to suspend participation in the negotiations, </p><p>reluctant as it might be as a regional leader to be seen as </p><p>the villain who killed the golden egg. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) The present moment could be an opportune time should </p><p>the USG decide to explore potential modifications to the FTAA </p><p>negotiations that would give Brazil some of the political </p><p>backing it is seeking.  As noted above, Regis Arslanian </p><p>seemed to suggest to econoff that Mercosul could be flexible </p><p>on a number of areas important to the United States -- </p><p>services and investment rules, IPR and government procurement </p><p>within the FTAA -- as long as market access could be </p><p>negotiated bilaterally.  In future discussions the USG may </p><p>have with the GOB on this issue, we would of course be </p><p>leaving Brazil in no doubt that it, not the USG, is the </p><p>demandeur for change in FTAA scope.
