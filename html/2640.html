<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000881 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 18/03/02 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PGOV, PINR, TBIO, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: A TIV PERSPECTIVE ON THE BENUE/TARABA </p><p>CONFLICT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY:  A February 14 dinner hosted by Governor </p><p>Akume gave the Ambassador an eye on the Tiv worldview. </p><p>Parochial and biased, it is shared by Benue Tiv leaders </p><p>ranging from Senator Gyado to ex-COAS Malu and posits that </p><p>the Tiv are victims of systematic discrimination.  However, </p><p>these Tiv elites offered no practical steps to resolve the </p><p>growing conflict between Tivs and neighboring ethnic </p><p>groups.  Aggressive Tiv ethno-centrism is but one issue </p><p>Nigeria\'s leaders must manage.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Ambassador Jeter was in Benue State February 14/15 </p><p>to commission an USAID-funded Rice Mill operated by a Benue </p><p>State NGO that focuses its assistance on children affected </p><p>by HIV/AIDS.  Benue has Nigeria\'s highest sero-positivity </p><p>rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The Ambassador, accompanied by the USAID Director </p><p>and Staff Assistant (note-taker), paid a visit to Governor </p><p>George Akume in Makurdi, the Benue State capital.  The </p><p>clashes between Tivs and neighboring ethnic groups in Benue </p><p>and other states dominated the dinner discussion.  Most of </p><p>the people at the dinner were Tiv luminaries whose constant </p><p>theme was: as the Tivs fare, so fares Nigeria.  Right now, </p><p>neither was doing particularly well.  Among those present </p><p>were former Senate President Jacob (Jack) Tilley Gyado, </p><p>dismissed Chief of Army Staff Victor Malu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  These members of the Benue State elite stressed that </p><p>many Tivs are former soldiers, still armed and ready to </p><p>take action if they perceive that Tiv interests are </p><p>threatened.  They also noted that Tiv farmers are </p><p>responsible for a significant portion of the country\'s </p><p>agricultural output.  Unrest in and around Tiv-dominated </p><p>Benue means reduced food availability and increased risk of </p><p>violent political unrest, they argued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Governor Akume reiterated claims that the recent </p><p>Tiv-Jukun violence arose from Jukun efforts to drive Tivs </p><p>from Taraba.  There was a clear consensus that the Tivs who </p><p>allegedly killed 19 soldiers actually may have killed </p><p>Jukuns dressed as soldiers or, at least, thought they were </p><p>killing Jukuns dressed as soldiers.  The Governor also </p><p>claimed that the killing of Tivs by the Army continues </p><p>"unabated," citing a January 26 incident in which at least </p><p>10 Tivs reportedly died when a Tiv village was burned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Noting that the Tivs are often viewed as strangers </p><p>when they move into new areas, the dinner guests said Tivs </p><p>have been excluded from the political process in Taraba and </p><p>even prevented from practicing their traditional culture. </p><p>The leaders claimed that in Tiv-majority areas, on the </p><p>other hand, they respect the culture of minorities and </p><p>include them in the political process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  In response to a question from the Ambassador, the </p><p>leaders claimed that Tiv agriculture was not expansionists, </p><p>that farmers do move from plot to plot, but usually within </p><p>a defined area.  The guests acknowledged that Tiv </p><p>population growth requires bringing steadily more land </p><p>under this system of rotating cultivation but claimed that </p><p>this should not present a problem since only about 15 </p><p>percent of the arable land in Nigeria is currently being </p><p>used. Therefore, the Tivs\' "expansionary" agriculture does </p><p>not threaten the viability of other groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Discrimination against Tivs, the group said, extends </p><p>to the federal government.  They contrasted the GON </p><p>response to the victims of the recent Ikeja armory </p><p>explosions with its failure to provide support to the </p><p>victims of the Benue-Taraba conflict.  They noted that MoD </p><p>Danjuma is a Jukun and commented that President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>failure to visit or express condolences had damaged his </p><p>image among Tivs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  The Ambassador asked for ideas on finding a solution </p><p>to the perennial conflicts between Tivs and other tribes. </p><p>The group offered no realistic remedies, making only vague </p><p>references to a need for "more political will" and </p><p>recognition by other groups of the right of Tivs to "exist" </p><p>and practice their culture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Comment:  No ethnic group bordering Tivland is </p><p>currently at ease with the Tiv.  Their aggressive approach </p><p>to bringing land under cultivation undermines the cultures </p><p>of many of these groups (some of which are pastoral). </p><p>While the Tiv may "permit" minority groups in Tivland to </p><p>practice their cultures or participate in politics, there </p><p>is never any danger of the Tivs losing control.  Moreover, </p><p>say some non-Tivs, Tiv culture incorporates aspects of </p><p>tradition that are no longer compatible with Nigerian law. </p><p>After over a century of Tiv encroachment, the groups </p><p>bordering Tivland will no longer stand idly by as they </p><p>become minorities in their home areas.  Loss of control of </p><p>a Local Government Area Council means loss of federal </p><p>government revenue alloted to it.  Therein may lie the root </p><p>cause of often-violent conflict among the Tiv and their </p><p>neighbors. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
