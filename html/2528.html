<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 JAKARTA 000685 </p><p> </p><p>2002 DILI REPORT 8 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: EAST TIMOR: XANANA GUSMAO -- FINALLY -- DECLARES </p><p>CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY.  NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE HERO XANANA GUSMAO DECLARED </p><p>HIS INTENT TO BECOME THE FIRST-EVER ELECTED PRESIDENT OF </p><p>EAST TIMOR.  WITH LESS THAN 90 MINUTES TO GO BEFORE THE </p><p>FILING DEADLINE EXPIRED, GUSMAO ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION OF </p><p>MINOR OPPOSITION PARTIES TO THE CHAGRIN OF THE MAJORITY </p><p>PARTY FRETILIN.  FRETILIN WANTED GUSMAO TO RUN AS AN </p><p>CANDIDATE INDEPENDENTLY NOMINATED BY 5,000 CITIZENS. </p><p>XANANA NOW PITS HIS POPULARITY AGAINST THE FRETILIN\'S </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH AND DEEPENS THE PERSONAL WITH </p><p>FRETILIN.  HOWEVER, HE DID OFFER AN OLIVE BRANCH OF SORTS </p><p>BY UNDERLINING THAT HE WOULD CONTINUE HIS STATUS </p><p>INDEPENDENT OF PARTY AFFILIATION AND NOT CAMPAIGN OR </p><p>ENDORSE POLITICIANS FROM AMONG THE PARTIES WHO NOMINATED </p><p>HIM.  XANANA SHOULD CRUISE TO EASY VICTORY AGAINST THE ONLY </p><p>OTHER CANDIDATE IN THE RACE -- THE VENERABLE XAVIER DO </p><p>AMARAL, CURRENTLY THE DEPUTY OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND </p><p>FORMERLY THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF EAST TIMOR IN 1975.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>XANANA OFFICIALLY ENTERS RACE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE HERO "XANANA" GUSMAO OFFICIALLY </p><p>DECLARED HIMSELF A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 23. </p><p>ONLY MINUTES BEFORE THE FILING DEADLINE WAS TO EXPIRE, </p><p>XANANA LET TEN MINORITY POLITICAL PARTIES FORMALLY REGISTER </p><p>HIS CANDIDACY.  THESE PARTIES INCLUDE THE PSD AND PD, THE </p><p>MOST PROMINENT OPPOSITION.  THE TEN SUPPORTING PARTIES SPAN </p><p>THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM FROM THE CONSERVATIVE UDT THROUGH </p><p>THE SOCIALIST PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  NOTABLY ABSENT WAS FRETILIN, THE MAJORITY PARTY. </p><p>FRETILIN HAD WANTED GUSMAO TO ESCHEW ALL PARTY NOMINATIONS </p><p>AND RUN BY ACCEPTING A NON-PARTISAN PETITION OF 5,000 </p><p>CITIZEN SIGNATURES.  XANANA\'S SUPPORTERS HAD ACTUALLY </p><p>COMPLETED SUCH A PETITION IN TIME FOR GUSMAO\'S USE, BUT HE </p><p>OPTED DIFFERENTLY.  (ONLY ONE OTHER CANDIDATE IS </p><p>REGISTERED, THE ASDT PARTY\'S XAVIER DO AMARAL, THE DEPUTY </p><p>SPEAKER OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY -- AND NO THREAT TO </p><p>GUSMAO\'S CHANCES.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  GUSMAO HAS STEADFASTLY REFUSED THE INDIVIDUAL PETITION </p><p>ROUTE BECAUSE, HE ASSERTS, THAT WOULD MEAN HE WAS HARBORING </p><p>A PERSONAL ASPIRATION  TO BE PRESIDENT.  ALL ALONG, HE HAS </p><p>CLAIMED NO PERSONAL AMBITION.  THUS HE WOULD ONLY ACCEPT </p><p>THE IMPORTUNING OF OTHERS TO FILL THE OFFICE OF CHIEF </p><p>EXECUTIVE.  AT A MORE STRATEGIC LEVEL, XANANA WANTS TO RUN </p><p>AND WIN WITHOUT FRETILIN\'S SUPPORT TO DEMONSTRATE HE IS THE </p><p>ONE WHO ENJOYS THE PEOPLE\'S MANDATE.  WITH SUCH A MANDATE, </p><p>GUSMAO WOULD INCREASE HIS LEVERAGE IN THE POLICY MAKING </p><p>PROCESS, EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE FEW ENUMERATED </p><p>POWERS UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>XANANA:  "NOT AN OPPOSITION CANDIDATE" </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  XANANA DID EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH, OF SORTS, TO </p><p>FRETILIN.  HE SAID THAT, IN SPITE OF THE MINOR PARTY </p><p>NOMINATIONS, HE WOULD MAINTAIN A TOTALLY "INDEPENDENT" </p><p>POLITICAL POSTURE.  HE WOULD NOT BECOME THE "OPPOSITION\'S </p><p>PRESIDENT", NOR JOIN THOSE PARTIES.  XANANA HAS CREATED AN </p><p>UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION TO RAISE FUNDS AND MANAGE HIS </p><p>CAMPAIGN.  SUPPORTERS WILL HAVE TO FORSWEAR FORMAL </p><p>POLITICAL AFFILIATION -- AT LEAST TEMPORARILY -- WHILE </p><p>WORKING FOR HIM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  FRETILIN DOES NOT WANT TO ACTIVELY COUNTER XANANA. THEY </p><p>WANTED TO ENDORSE HIM UNDER THE PETITION SCHEME.  FRETILIN </p><p>IS NOT MONOLITHIC.  THERE IS A LARGE PRO-XANANA FACTION </p><p>WITHIN THE PARTY WHO LIKE HIM AND BELIEVE HE IS THE RIGHT </p><p>CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT.   ACCORDING TO A MID-LEVEL </p><p>FRETILIN OFFICIAL, FRETILIN WILL SOLVE ITS DILEMMA BY NOT </p><p>OPPOSING XANANA AND OFFICIALLY REMAINING "NEUTRAL."  THIS </p><p>WOULD FREE PARTY MEMBERS TO GO OUT AND "VOTE THEIR </p><p>CONSCIENCE." </p><p> </p><p>RAMOS HORTA CANNOT BROKER DEAL </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  FOREIGN MINISTER JOSE RAMOS HORTA, THE NOBEL PEACE </p><p>PRIZE WINNER, HAD BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES TO RESOLVE </p><p>MONTHS OF XANANA\'S INDECISION.  RAMOS HORTA HAD WORKED TO </p><p>ARRANGE THE 5,000 SIGNATURES TO DENY XANANA THE EXCUSE THAT </p><p>TIME HAD RUN OUT FOR THAT CANDIDATE OPTION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  FORTY-EIGHT HOURS BEFORE THE REGISTRATION EXPIRY, RAMOS </p><p>HORTA ADVISED SENIOR UNTAET (UNITED NATIONS TRANSITIONAL </p><p>ADMINISTRATION FOR EAST TIMOR) OFFICIALS THAT XANANA HAD </p><p>FINALLY AGREED TO GO THE PETITION ROUTE, ONLY HOURS AFTER </p><p>XANANA HAD INFORMED THE U.S. AMBASSADOR HE WAS LEANING </p><p>TOWARD ACCEPTING THE MINOR PARTY NOMINATIONS -- IF HE </p><p>DECIDED TO RUN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  RAMOS HORTA HAD EVEN WORKED OUT A PLAN IF XANANA DID </p><p>THE UNTHINKABLE AND DECIDED NOT TO RUN.  RAMOS HORTA, </p><p>HIGHLY RESPECTED DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, WOULD </p><p>HAVE ACCEPTED A FRETILIN NOMINATION AND RUN AS NATIONAL </p><p>UNITY CANDIDATE.  ALTHOUGH HE WAS HAPPY ABOUT XANANA\'S </p><p>FINAL DECISION TO STAND AS A CANDIDATE, XANANA\'S LATE </p><p>REVERSAL CONFOUNDED EVEN HORTA. </p><p> </p><p>XANANA AND FRETILIN: A WIDENING GULF? </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.   XANANA GUSMAO\'S REFUSAL TO GO THE PETITION ROUTE WILL </p><p>INCREASE FRICTION BETWEEN HIM AND THE FRETILIN PARTY. </p><p>THERE IS A CURRENTLY A SHARP PERSONAL RIFT BETWEEN GUSMAO </p><p>AND FRETILIN\'S MOST DOMINANT FIGURE, MARI ALKATIRI, WHO IS </p><p>CHIEF MINISTER OF EAST TIMOR\'S SECOND TRANSITIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND WILL ASCEND TO THE POWERFUL OFFICE OF PRIME </p><p>MINISTER AFTER INDEPENDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  SENIOR OFFICIALS WITHIN UNTAET, WHICH GOVERNS EAST </p><p>TIMOR UNTIL MAY 20, WOULD HAVE PREFERRED XANANA\'S </p><p>ACCEPTANCE OF THE PETITION ROUTE TO AVOID A WIDENING OF THE </p><p>XANANA/FRETILIN BREACH.  FRETILIN WILL DOMINATE THE NEW </p><p>PARLIAMENT AND CABINET.  THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE FEW </p><p>ENUMERATED POWERS AND WILL HAVE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH </p><p>FRETILIN  FOR GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE HARMONIOUSLY. </p><p>OFFICIALS WITHIN GOVERNMENT AND FRETILIN REPORT THAT </p><p>ALKATIRI HAS SOUGHT TO MEET WITH GUSMAO IN RECENT WEEKS </p><p>ONLY TO BE REBUFFED. </p><p> </p><p>12.  COMMENT:  GUSMAO KNOWS HE IS MORE POPULAR THAN </p><p>FRETILIN OR ALKATIRI PERSONALLY.  THIS MAY HAVE LED HIM TO </p><p>IGNORE FRETILIN -- RATHER THAN NEGOTIATE WITH THEM -- ABOUT </p><p>THE TERMS OF HIS CANDIDACY.  ALTHOUGH THIS WILL WORK FOR </p><p>HIM DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IT IS THE WRONG </p><p>PRESCRIPTION FOR ENACTING LEGISLATION OR IMPLEMENTING </p><p>NATIONAL POLICIES POST-MAY 20.  XANANA\'S WAVERING ABOUT HIS </p><p>CANDIDACY HAS BEEN WORTHY OF A PERFORMANCE OF SHAKESPEARE\'S </p><p>"HAMLET," BUT THE UNCERTAINTY INVITES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS </p><p>ROLE AS A DECISIVE OFFICE-HOLDER AFTER AN ELECTION HE IS </p><p>SURE TO WIN. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>BOYCE </p><p></p></div>
