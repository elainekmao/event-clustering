<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003399 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, E/CBED, OES, EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, EWWT, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY RESPONDES TO RUSSIAN IMO PAPER ON TURKISH </p><p>STRAITS REGULATIONS </p><p> </p><p> 1. (SBU) Summary:  MFA Chief of Maritime Affairs Erciyes </p><p>told econoff May 22 that the paper Russia had submitted to </p><p>the IMO, which claims that Turkey has implemented new, costly </p><p>restrictions on passage through the Turkish Straits, was </p><p>factually incorrect.  Erciyes maintained that the guidelines </p><p>issued by Turkey in October 2002 did not change the Maritime </p><p>Traffic Regulations established in 1998; rather, these </p><p>guidelines were designed to more strictly enforce the current </p><p>regulations.  Erciyes said recent delays of passage in the </p><p>Straits were due primarily to increased tanker traffic, heavy </p><p>weather conditions, and the failure of vessels to provide </p><p>required documentation.  Erciyes noted that the Vessel </p><p>Traffic System (VTS) should begin operating on July 1,2003. </p><p>He requested U.S. support of Turkey\'s efforts to ensure the </p><p>safety of life, property, and the environment in the Straits. </p><p> End summary. </p><p>2. (SBU) Econoff met with MFA Chief of Maritime Affairs </p><p>Cagatay Erciyes May 22 to discuss the paper submitted by </p><p>Russia to the IMO, which claims that Turkey has implemented </p><p>new restrictions on passage through the Turkish Straits, </p><p>which have resulted in lengthy delays and higher costs for </p><p>shippers.  Erciyes said the GOT regretted that Russia had </p><p>submitted this paper, which was factually incorrect and even </p><p>absurd in some parts.  He said the GOT was somewhat surprised </p><p>that Russia had taken this position, since the government had </p><p>gone to great lengths to explain its position to Russia. </p><p>3. (SBU) Erciyes told econoff that, despite what the Russians </p><p>claimed in their paper, the guidelines issued by Turkey in </p><p>October 2002 did not change the Maritime Traffic Regulations </p><p>established in 1998.  Rather, due to increased traffic in the </p><p>Straits, Turkish authorities determined that the 1998 </p><p>Regulations must be more strictly enforced in order to ensure </p><p>the safety of life, property, and the environment in the </p><p>Straits.  Erciyes said this new guidance contained four basic </p><p>new elements: </p><p>-- The ship length criteria for temporary suspension of 2-way </p><p>traffic had been reduced from 250 meters to 200 meters. </p><p>(Erciyes said the 200 meter criteria was also in the 1998 </p><p>regulations). </p><p>-- Ships are now required to submit all required technical </p><p>documentation, such as those documents pertaining to </p><p>International Oil Pollution Prevention, through the ship </p><p>reporting system. </p><p>-- All administrative dues owed by ships must be paid, and </p><p>the receipts shown to the Turkish traffic control center, </p><p>before ships are allowed passage. </p><p>-- The regulation of passage priority for ships waiting for </p><p>passage will not be determined on a first-come, first-serve </p><p>basis, but rather on the basis of safety.  For example, </p><p>passenger ships will go first and dangerous cargo ships last. </p><p>4. (SBU) Erciyes said the Russians claimed that delays in the </p><p>Straits have increased fourfold since Turkey implemented </p><p>these new guidelines.  He allowed that delays had increased, </p><p>but not primarily due to the new guidelines.  Erciyes </p><p>attributed recent delays to three factors: </p><p>-- A 75 percent increase in tanker traffic in the last five </p><p>years -- in 1997, 4,303 tankers and dangerous cargo vessels </p><p>passed through the Straits; in 2002 that number was 7,427. </p><p>-- Vessels were failing to submit required reports to traffic </p><p>control stations, which was causing congestion and delays. </p><p>-- Heavy winter weather conditions - in the first three </p><p>months of2003 traffic was suspended for 1,029 hours. 524 </p><p>hours of suspended traffic were due to the passage of large </p><p>ships and tankers; 505 hours were due to heavy winter weather </p><p>conditions. </p><p>5. (SBU) Erciyes stated that, although the Russians were </p><p>exaggerating the situation, delays in the Straits were a </p><p>reality. However, he said, the top priority for the Turkish </p><p>government was to ensure the safety of life, property, and </p><p>environment in the Straits. He noted that there was increased </p><p>global concern for safety and security in maritime affairs. </p><p>Turkey, for its part, had taken steps to enhance safety and </p><p>security in the Straits, in a manner which conformed to the </p><p>1998 Regulations and IMO standards. He said Turkey hoped the </p><p>U.S. and its European partners to support Turkey in its </p><p>efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Erciyes added that the GOT expected the Vessel </p><p>Traffic System (VTS) in the Straits to be functional on a </p><p>trial basis as of July I, 2003. The VTS should also </p><p>contribute to safety of navigation in the Straits.  Erciyes </p><p>gave econoff a non-paper on this subject, which he said was </p><p>only a draft in preparation for the May 28-June 26 IMO </p><p>meetings (faxed to OES, E/CBED and EUR/SE). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
