(U) In a newspaper interview with a local English </p><p>daily, the UAE Labor Undersecretary Dr. Khalid Al- </p><p>Khazraji declared, in response to a question about the </p><p>legality of strikes in the UAE, "The UAE labour law </p><p>has not forbidden strikes.  It has not mentioned them </p><p>as it has a system for labourers to get their rights </p><p>without the need for them to organise strikes. </p><p>Labourers have rights and if they are denied them, </p><p>they can stop working."  Al-Khazraji also stated in </p><p>the interview, "Regarding accusing the UAE authorities </p><p>of not offering enough protection to labourers in the </p><p>country, I think it is baseless and the ministry has </p><p>never ignored complaints by workers against their </p><p>employees.  We follow the legal procedure as specified </p><p>by the law, we try to settle the dispute before </p><p>referring it to the court and finally ask the two </p><p>parties to go to the court if we fail to resolve the </p><p>issue." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Comment: Dr. Al-Khazraji is the public face </p><p>of labor reform in the UAE -- he is quoted on an </p><p>almost daily basis in the newspapers expounding upon </p><p>Ministry initiatives.  His high profile is indicative </p><p>not only of his prominence in the UAE bureaucracy but </p><p>it is also a testament to his abilities.  Al-Khazraji </p><p>is well-known to the Embassy and highly regarded for </p><p>his intelligence and understanding of the complexities </p><p>of the labor issues in the UAE.  Though Al-Khazraji\'s </p><p>statements are predictable -- a bureaucrat would never </p><p>state publicly that the government was not doing all </p><p>it could as efficiently as possible -- they are </p><p>nevertheless an accurate acknowledgement by an </p><p>important Labor official of the reality on the ground. </p><p>Workers do go on strike, and there are significant </p><p>formal and informal dispute resolution mechanisms </p><p>available to laborers. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
