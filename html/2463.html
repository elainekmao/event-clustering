<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000407 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JFRAZER, JFICKLIN </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: 02/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, OPDC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SPECIAL APPEAL TO PRESIDENT BUSH ON THE </p><p>LAGOS MUNITIONS DISASTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) ABUJA 366;  (B) LAGOS 266 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON 1.5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) On 05 February, Embassy received the following </p><p>letter of Special Appeal from President Obasanjo to </p><p>President Bush.  The original letter has been pouched to </p><p>AF/W, and a copy faxed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>February 4, 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>His Excellency, </p><p>Mr. George Bush </p><p>President of the United States of America, </p><p>White House, </p><p>Washington, DC, </p><p>USA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear President, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I thank you for your expression of support and sympathy </p><p>after the recent tragic incident in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After canceling my trip to New York, we have been busy </p><p>sorting out the details of this disaster.  Full disposal of </p><p>unexploded ammunition will turn out to be of immense </p><p>proportion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I can confirm with appreciation that a small group of </p><p>military experts from the United States and Britain with </p><p>their Nigerian counterparts are currently on ground to </p><p>assess the scale of work required. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A preliminary report indicates that we will be needing a </p><p>very strong team that will be working in the area for a </p><p>considerable period of time, in months rather than weeks, </p><p>and this is an exercise for which we lack personnel with </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>technical capacity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mr. President, I wish to make this special appeal to the </p><p>Government of the United States, to kindly consider </p><p>assisting Nigeria in this period of need to provide for us </p><p>the technical assistance for the disposal of the unexploded </p><p>ammunition and explosives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest </p><p>esteem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yours sincerely, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>/sgd/ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo </p><p>End Text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment: Ref B thoroughly documents the powerful </p><p>expectations of GON officials and ordinary Nigerians that </p><p>the USG (with or without the UK) will response to this </p><p>terrible tragedy.  Minister of State Batagarawa has already </p><p>begun to implement some of the measures the assessment team </p><p>has recommended.  He was critical to the huge success of </p><p>OFR-P3, and we know we can work effectively with him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Obasanjo Administration - and Nigeria\'s recent </p><p>democracy  re in deep trouble.  If the international </p><p>friends of this country do not mobilize to assist the GON </p><p>at this critical juncture, the increasing instability here </p><p>may worsen and could produce developments inimical to U.S. </p><p>national interests, including the War on Terror in which </p><p>Nigeria has been a staunch and vocal ally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  We are convinced that other donors - notably HMG, </p><p>since PM Blair begins an official visit later today - will </p><p>feel compelled to chip in if the USG provides the requisite </p><p>initial critical mass (exact requirements TBD but certainly </p><p>to include robust EOB capability and adequate </p><p>medical/medevac support).  We urge the Department and the </p><p>entire interagency to quickly identify and program adequate </p><p>resources to respond to Obasanjo  special appeal. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
