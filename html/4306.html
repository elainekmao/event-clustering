<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006691 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP, NEA/ARN FOR ZIADEH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CASC </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 201772 </p><p> </p><p>1. Answers keyed to reftel. </p><p> </p><p>A) (U) Significant actions taken by host governments to </p><p>support the global coalition against terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>The GOJ continues to be a strong supporter of the global </p><p>coalition against terrorism and has responded positively to </p><p>our requests for assistance. To support Operation Enduring </p><p>Freedom (OEF) efforts in Afghanistan, the GOJ continues to </p><p>maintain a de-mining platoon and a Jordanian Armed Forces </p><p>(JAF) field hospital there. </p><p> </p><p>B) (U) Describe the response of the judicial system of each </p><p>country to acts of international and/or domestic terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>The Jordanian penal code provides the judicial branch with </p><p>many legal tools to pursue and convict terrorists.  In 2002, </p><p>the GOJ was involved in prosecuting several terrorism-related </p><p>cases. </p><p> </p><p>--  The GOJ is currently prosecuting 10 Jordanians involved </p><p>in a plot to target U.S. interests in Jordan, possibly </p><p>including people jogging in the neighborhood surrounding the </p><p>Embassy.  Members of the group have allegedly confessed to </p><p>buying machineguns to launch military attacks inside Israel. </p><p> </p><p>--  Ra\'ed Hijazi:  The Court of Cassation requested </p><p>information from the State Security Court in October 2002 to </p><p>support the death penalty sentence handed down by the State </p><p>Security Court earlier this year.  Despite press reports to </p><p>the contrary, Hijazi is not being retried and remains in </p><p>custody. </p><p> </p><p>--  "Reform and Challenge" organization:  The State Security </p><p>Court on Wednesday, October 2, 2002 acquitted six men </p><p>standing trial on charges of carrying out subversive and </p><p>arson acts in 1998. </p><p> </p><p>-- Assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na\'eb al-Ma\'ayteh:  In </p><p>July 2002, the Court of Cassation upheld the death by hanging </p><p>sentence handed down by the State Security Court in December </p><p>2001 against Yasser Abu Shinnar for his role in the 1994 </p><p>assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na\'eb Ma\'ayteh. </p><p> </p><p>-- Car bomb plotters:  On May 20, 2002, the State Security </p><p>Court prosecutors indicted six unnamed suspects in connection </p><p>with a bomb that targeted the vehicle of a GID </p><p>counterterrorism officer.  The blast killed two passersby. </p><p>There has been no date set for the trial. </p><p> </p><p>The GOJ continues to apprehend and prosecute individuals </p><p>involved in smuggling weapons and/or explosives to the West </p><p>Bank.  For example, four Syrians in July 2002 were convicted </p><p>of illegally possessing explosives and received sentences </p><p>ranging from one and a half years to three years. </p><p> </p><p>C) (U) Did the host government extradite or request the </p><p>extradition of suspected terrorists for prosecution during </p><p>the year? </p><p> </p><p>Yes, Jamal Fatayer was extradited from Libya in January 2002 </p><p>in connection with the 1994 assassination of Jordanian </p><p>diplomat Nayeb Ma\'aytah in Beirut. </p><p> </p><p>D) (U) Describe any significant impediments to host </p><p>government prosecution and/or extradition of suspected </p><p>terrorists. </p><p> </p><p>There are no legal or administrative impediments to the </p><p>prosecution of terrorist cases in Jordan.  However, there are </p><p>some constitutional impediments to extraditing Jordanian </p><p>citizens who may be suspected terrorists.  Most extraditions </p><p>have been put on hold following a 1997 Jordanian court ruling </p><p>that Jordan\'s bilateral extradition treaty with the U.S. is </p><p>invalid until ratified by parliament. </p><p> </p><p>E) (U) Discuss host government responses other than </p><p>prosecution. </p><p> </p><p>GOJ officials have consistently issued statements denouncing </p><p>both international and domestic terrorist acts. </p><p> </p><p>The GOJ is working closely with US officials to investigate </p><p>the October 28 murder of USAID officer Laurence Foley. </p><p> </p><p>F) (U) Describe major counterterrorism efforts undertaken in </p><p>2002 by the host government, including steps taken in </p><p>international fora. </p><p> </p><p>GOJ officials are close to signing two additional UN </p><p>terrorism conventions, which would make Jordan a signatory on </p><p>10 of the 12 conventions. </p><p> </p><p>H) (U) Has the host government made any public statements in </p><p>support of a terrorist-supporting country on a terrorism </p><p>issue? </p><p> </p><p>No </p><p>I) (U) Describe any significant change since 2001 in the host </p><p>government\'s attitude toward terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>There has been no change in the GOJ\'s strong commitment to </p><p>the coalition against terrorism or to its own domestic </p><p>counterterrorism program. </p><p>J) (U) Describe U.S. counterterrorism efforts and initiatives </p><p>with the host government, including, but not limited to, </p><p>requests to the host government for specific cooperation and </p><p>efforts by the U.S. in the host country to eliminate </p><p>international financial support to terrorist grounds directly </p><p>or in support of their activities. </p><p> </p><p>The USG has a robust Anti-terrorism Assistance (ATA) program </p><p>with Jordan, which has increased the professionalism of the </p><p>Public Security Directorate (PSD).  ATA training has also </p><p>been extended to other sectors of the Jordanian government. </p><p>This spring, ATA provided training in counterterrorism </p><p>legislation to several participants from the legislative and </p><p>financial government sectors. </p><p> </p><p>At this time, there is no evidence that Jordan is a center of </p><p>illicit funding for terrorist groups.  Under UNSCR 1267, </p><p>Jordanian authorities have searched bank, stock exchange, and </p><p>land registry records but have found no evidence of financial </p><p>or real assets in Jordan connected with any of the groups or </p><p>individuals listed by the United Nations or EO 13224. </p><p> </p><p>K) (U) Cooperation with host government during the previous </p><p>five years: </p><p> </p><p>-- (I) The extent to which the host government in 2002 </p><p>cooperated or is cooperating with the USG in apprehending, </p><p>convicting, and punishing the individual(s) responsible for </p><p>the act. </p><p> </p><p>The GOJ has aggressively pursued suspected terrorists, and </p><p>has successfully prosecuted and convicted many involved in </p><p>plots against US or Israeli interests. </p><p> </p><p>The GOJ is in the preliminary stages of its investigation </p><p>into the death of Laurence Foley and has conducted the </p><p>investigation in cooperation with USG officials. </p><p> </p><p>-- (II) The extent to which the host government in 2002 </p><p>cooperated or is cooperating in preventing further acts of </p><p>terrorism against US citizens. </p><p> </p><p>The GOJ has been very responsive to the security needs of US </p><p>citizens in Jordan.  During times of tension, the GOJ has </p><p>increased security around the embassy perimeter and in areas </p><p>where Americans tend to gather, including tourist sites and </p><p>hotels.  After the tragic murder of USAID administrator </p><p>Laurence Foley, the security services immediately increased </p><p>security around the homes of most US diplomats and increased </p><p>the presence of marked and unmarked patrol cars in the </p><p>neighborhoods of US diplomats. </p><p> </p><p>L) (U) If the US has sought cooperation during the past five </p><p>years, describe the extent to which the host government in </p><p>2002 cooperated or is cooperating in preventing acts of </p><p>terrorism against US citizens. </p><p> </p><p>Please see above. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
