END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. DENMARK IS A MAJOR DONOR TO WFP. ITS CONTRIBUTIONS IN CY </p><p>2001 EQUALED USD 38.6 MILLION (SIXTH LARGEST). IN SUPPORT TO </p><p>WFP\'S DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO, DENMARK RANKED SECOND THIS PAST </p><p>YEAR WITH A CONTRIBUTION OF USD 25.4 MILLION. </p><p> </p><p>3. STEMMING FROM THE RECENT ADOPTION OF A NEW STRATEGY FOR </p><p>"ACTIVE MULTILATERALISM" BY THE DANISH PARLIAMENT, THE ROYAL </p><p>DANISH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS DECIDED TO TASK ITS </p><p>EMBASSIES IN BANGLADESH, BOLIVIA, NICARAGUA, VIETNAM AND </p><p>ZAMBIA WITH PARTICIPATION IN A MONITORING OF WFP ACTIVITIES </p><p>INCLUDING VISITS TO FIELD SITES, INTERVIEWS WITH WFP COUNTRY </p><p>STAFF AND OTHER RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS, AND FILLING OUT A </p><p>DETAILED QUESTIONNAIRE. THE REPORT NOTES THAT WFP, AT USD </p><p>1.55 BILLION/ANNUM, IS PRESENTLY THE SECOND LARGEST PROVIDER </p><p>OF ASSISTANCE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITHIN THE UN-SYSTEM, </p><p>SURPASSED ONLY BY UNDP (WITH CORE AND NON-CORE RESOURCES OF </p><p>USD 2.6 BILLION). </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>MAJOR FINDINGS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. IN GENERAL, THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT WFP HAS </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF ITS DEVELOPMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00544  01 OF 04  051344Z </p><p>PORTFOLIO. IT FELT THAT WFP WAS SHIFTING AWAY FROM LARGE- </p><p>SCALE DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IMPLEMENTED BY </p><p>MEANS OF FOOD-FOR-WORK, AND INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN THE SOCIAL SECTOR, SUCH AS SCHOOL FEEDING OR </p><p>VULNERABLE GROUP FEEDING - AND AT TIMES FACING LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT OPPOSITION TO THIS SHIFT IN EMPHASIS. </p><p> </p><p>5. IN LOOKING AT THE OVERALL WFP DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO </p><p>WORLDWIDE, THE STUDY NOTED THAT WFP HAD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS </p><p>IN 58 COUNTRIES AND THAT MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF THESE </p><p>PROGRAMS WERE LESS THAN USD 3 MILLION. WHILE NOT DISCOUNTING </p><p>SMALL COUNTRY PROGRAMS, THE STUDY SUGGESTED THAT WFP MIGHT </p><p>QUICKLY PHASE OUT OF MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES (PRESENTLY UP </p><p>TO TEN PERCENT OF THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO) AND </p><p>PRIORITIZE ITS ASSISTANCE TO THE POORER OF THE LOW-INCOME </p><p>FOOD DEFICIT (LIFDC) COUNTRIES.

THE STUDY SUGGESTED THAT BOLIVIA BE EXAMINED </p><p>FOR POSSIBLE PHASE OUT. </p><p> </p><p>6. ON WFP\'S EMERGENCY OPERATIONS (EMOPS) (PRESENTLY OVER </p><p>HALF OF ITS ANNUAL PORTFOLIO), THE STUDY COMMENTED: "IT IS </p><p>SURPRISING TO NOTE THAT ONLY LIMITED DISCUSSION HAS TAKEN </p><p>PLACE AT THE BOARD LEVEL ABOUT THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS." IT </p><p>FURTHER NOTED: "NO COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY HAS BEEN ADOPTED </p><p>FOR RELIEF ASSISTANCE."

NOTE: EMOPS ARE APPROVED BY THE WFP EXECUTIVE </p><p>DIRECTOR; WHEN THE WFP FOOD INPUT VALUE SUPPLIED EXCEEDS USD </p><p>3 MILLION, THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF FAO MUST ALSO APPROVE. </p><p>END NOTE. THE STUDY CONCLUDES: "IT WOULD SEEM DESIRABLE TO </p><p>DRAW THE BOARD MORE INTO THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF </p><p>EMOPS, PROVIDING THAT IT CAN BE DONE IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT </p><p>HAMPER WFP\'S RESPONSIBILITY TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND </p><p>EFFECTIVELY. TO SERVE THIS PURPOSE, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO </p><p>ELABORATE A SET OF CLEAR YET FLEXIBLE GUIDELINES FOR WFP\'S </p><p>EMERGENCY OPERATIONS FOR ADOPTION BY THE BOARD." </p><p> </p><p>7. ON WFP\'S COUNTRY STRATEGY OUTLINE (CSO) AND COUNTRY </p><p>PROGRAM (CP), THE STUDY SUPPORTED THE SUGGESTION OF THE </p><p>WORKING GROUP ON GOVERNANCE (MAY 2000) THAT THE CSO AND CP </p><p>COULD BE MERGED INTO ONE DOCUMENT. ON THE UN IN-COUNTRY </p><p>DOCUMENTS, NAMELY THE CCA (COMMON COUNTRY ASSESSMENT) AND </p><p>THE UNDAF (UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK), </p><p>THE CCAS "WERE CONSIDERED TO BE USEFUL DOCUMENTS, WITH VERY </p><p>RELEVANT BACKGROUND ANALYSIS." THE STUDY WAS MUCH LESS </p><p>SANGUINE ON THE UNDAF, COMMENTING THAT "THERE WAS STILL A </p><p>LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE UNDAF COULD BE PRESENTED AS A TRULY </p><p>COMMON UN RESPONSE TO THE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES IN THE HOST </p><p>COUNTRY." IN A COROLLARY DOCUMENT "IDEAS TO STRENGTHEN THE </p><p>CCA/UNDAF PROCESS," ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF DENMARK, </p><p>FINLAND, NORWAY AND SWEDEN (OCTOBER 2001) IT IS SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT MANY COUNTRIES HAVE EITHER DEVELOPED OR ARE DEVELOPING </p><p>BROAD-BASED NATIONAL POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGIES (PRSP) AND </p><p>THAT THE CCA/UNDAF GUIDELINES "BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THIS </p><p>MAJOR AND POSITIVE CHANGE." </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00544  02 OF 04  051344Z </p><p> </p><p>8.

SEVERAL KEY POINTS WERE TABLED: </p><p> </p><p>A)   WFP MUST DEVOTE MORE ATTENTION TO CAPACITY BUILDING AND </p><p>   INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING OF COUNTERPART AGENCIES; </p><p>B)   WFP IS FOCUSED ON OUTPUTS SUCH AS TONS OF FOOD </p><p>   DELIVERED AND NUMBER OF PEOPLE FED RATHER THAN PROVIDING A </p><p>   CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING THE DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT OF </p><p>   ITS ACTIVITIES; </p><p>C)   THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT WFP PROGRAMS HAVE AN </p><p>   IMPACT, BUT WFP NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS </p><p>   IMPACT IS REASONABLE COMPARED TO THE COSTS INVOLVED. </p><p>   CONSEQUENTLY, WFP MUST INTRODUCE CLEAR AND QUANTIFIABLE </p><p>   SUCCESS INDICATORS WHEN DESIGNING ITS PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS; </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTO0725 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00544  03 OF 04  051345Z </p><p>ACTION FOE-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    MMP-00   NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      SA-00    FMP-00   PRM-00   SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------624600  051353Z /38 </p><p>P 051322Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 1962 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERN </p><p>AMEMBASSY LA PAZ </p><p>AMEMBASSY DHAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>AMEMBASSY MANAGUA </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 1985 </p><p> </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2537 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00544  03 OF 04  051345Z </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 000544 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S/FAS PENN AND MCHAMBLISS </p><p>USAID FOR DCHA/DAA/GRIGSBY AND D/FFP LANDIS </p><p>STATE FOR A/S/PRM DEWEY, DAS/IO/SANDERS AND RBERSTEIN </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN, HTHOMAS </p><p>OMB FOR TSTOLL </p><p>USUN FOR LSHESTACK </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS FOR USAID/FULLER </p><p>TOKYO FOR USAID REP </p><p>GAO FOR PTHOMAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, AORC, WFP, UN, PREF, EU </p><p>SUBJECT: WFP MONITORING - STUDY UNDERTAKEN BY THE ROYAL </p><p>DANISH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN BANGLADESH, BOLIVIA, </p><p>NICARAGUA, VIETNAM AND ZAMBIA </p><p> </p><p>D)   IN GENERAL, THERE SEEMS TO BE A SCOPE FOR GREATER USE </p><p>   OF THE UN TECHNICAL AGENCIES AS SUBCONTRACTORS IN </p><p>   IMPLEMENTATION; </p><p>E)   ON EVALUATION, "THE GENERAL AIM IS THAT COUNTRY OFFICES </p><p>   SHOULD INCREASINGLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL STAGES OF </p><p>   EVALUATION (OF ITS PROGRAMS). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>"MARKET DISRUPTION" AND "DEPENDENCE" ON FOOD AID </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00544  03 OF 04  051345Z </p><p> </p><p>10.
