During February 2003, the World Food Programme </p><p>(WFP) distributed 54,567 metric tons (MT) of food </p><p>commodities in Zimbabwe, increasing by over 10,000 </p><p>MT distribution totals from January 2003.  The </p><p>distribution reached 4.285 million beneficiaries </p><p>in 49 targeted districts.  In March 2003, WFP </p><p>plans to target 4.7 million beneficiaries with </p><p>59,262 MT of food commodities.  Including other </p><p>pipeline sources, notably USAID\'s C-SAFE </p><p>(Consortium for the Southern Africa Food Security </p><p>Emergency) pipeline covering 7 additional </p><p>districts, a total of 5.529 million beneficiaries </p><p>in rural and communal areas are expected to be </p><p>reached in March.  WFP reports that it will have </p><p>sufficient food commodities to meet cereal </p><p>distribution requirements through the end of April </p><p>2003.  Adequate supplies of pulses and oil still </p><p>need to be confirmed for this period.  Due to </p><p>adequate existing milling arrangements, it is </p><p>increasingly unlikely that WFP will need to mill </p><p>US-donated maize in Harare or Gweru at this stage. </p><p>The United States remains the largest single donor </p><p>to the WFP emergency operation in Zimbabwe.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>WFP EXPANDS DISTRIBUTION QUANTITY IN FEBRUARY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  During February 2003, WFP and its implementing </p><p>partners (IPs) distributed a total of 54,567 MT of </p><p>food commodities to 4.285 million beneficiaries in </p><p>49 of 49 targeted districts in Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>February distribution was WFP\'s largest to date, </p><p>over 10,000 MT more than January\'s 42,428 MT.  The </p><p>current distribution was also able to reach over 1 </p><p>million more beneficiaries than the January </p><p>distribution.  The total tonnage distributed </p><p>during February consisted of 42,961 MT of maize, </p><p>4,347 MT of pulses, 2,536 MT of vegetable oil, and </p><p>4,723 MT of corn-soy blend (CSB). </p><p> </p><p>3.  NOTE:  According to the Zimbabwe Vulnerability </p><p>Assessment Committee\'s December Report, there are </p><p>5.9 million rural Zimbabweans in need of food </p><p>assistance.  WFP has assumed responsibility for </p><p>covering food aid needs in 49 of Zimbabwe\'s 57 </p><p>rural districts.  The total population in need in </p><p>these 49 districts is estimated to be 5.1 million </p><p>people.  Of the remaining eight districts, seven </p><p>are covered by the USAID-funded C-SAFE, and one is </p><p>covered by Save the Children-United Kingdom.  The </p><p>total population in need in these eight </p><p>"bilateral" districts is roughly 0.8 million.  END </p><p>NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>BENEFICIARY TARGETS AND PROJECTIONS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  In January, WFP projected that its February </p><p>distributions would be 53,500 MT and 4.25 million </p><p>beneficiaries.  WFP surpassed the projection in </p><p>terms of tonnage delivered and essentially met the </p><p>targeted number of beneficiaries for the month of </p><p>February. </p><p> </p><p>5.  For March 2003, WFP plans to target roughly 93 </p><p>percent of the total rural population in need, </p><p>that is, 4.7 million beneficiaries of the </p><p>estimated 5.1 million.  A total of 59,262 MT of </p><p>food commodities is projected to be distributed in </p><p>all 49 of WFP\'s targeted districts.    Comment: </p><p>When combined with the C-SAFE pipeline which is </p><p>distributing food to nearly 700,000 beneficiaries </p><p>in 7 districts for a total of over 5.5 million </p><p>people, the international food assistance effort </p><p>has become immense.  Although post is still unable </p><p>to get accurate data on GOZ food imports and </p><p>distributions, it seems clear that international </p><p>food now dwarfs other sources of food, </p><p>particularly GOZ food, and can no longer be </p><p>characterized as targeted food assistance.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>FOOD PIPELINE STRONG THROUGH END OF APRIL </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  At WFP\'s current ration of 10 kilograms (kg) </p><p>of cereals, 1.0 kg. of pulses/beans and 0.6 kg. </p><p>vegetable oil per person per month (pppm), it </p><p>projects that it will have sufficient cereal </p><p>supplies to provide a full ration to all of its </p><p>targeted beneficiaries through the end of April </p><p>2003.  Full rations for pulses and oil up to the </p><p>end of April 2003 still need to be confirmed.  By </p><p>the end of March, WFP expects to stop general </p><p>distribution of dry CSB rations, in favor of </p><p>targeted supplementary feeding in all districts </p><p>for selected vulnerable groups.  WFP is currently </p><p>identifying additional partner organizations to </p><p>implement the supplementary feeding program. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WFP\'s current Emergency Operation (EMOP) </p><p>10200.0 is scheduled to be completed at the end of </p><p>March 2003.  The EMOP will be extended by three </p><p>months, until the end of June 2003.  In May, in </p><p>expectation of the maize harvest, WFP projects </p><p>that it will cut its beneficiary population from </p><p>the current high of 5.0 million beneficiaries. </p><p>The extent of the cuts will depend on crop </p><p>assessments for the upcoming harvest, expected to </p><p>be completed by the end of March, and other </p><p>factors described below.  WFP will likely require </p><p>additional pledges of cereals, pulses, and CSB to </p><p>meet beneficiary requirements through the end of </p><p>June.  These actual needs will be better clarified </p><p>once the crop assessments are completed, </p><p>beneficiary numbers are readjusted, as necessary, </p><p>and other donor contributions are confirmed. </p><p>Based on current rough estimates, WFP projects a </p><p>shortfall of some 50,000 MT of cereals, 15,000 MT </p><p>of pulses, and 20,000 MT CSB through the end of </p><p>June 2003. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN BRIDGE TO OPEN AT BEITBRIDGE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  WFP has reached agreement with the Government </p><p>of South Africa and the Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>(GOZ) to reopen the old bridge over the Limpopo </p><p>River at the Beitbridge/Messina border crossing. </p><p>The bridge will be used for humanitarian purposes </p><p>only, and is expected to greatly reduce the time </p><p>required for humanitarian assistance to transit </p><p>the border.  The bridge is still undergoing </p><p>rehabilitation, and is expected to open in late </p><p>March (2003). </p><p> </p><p>9.  WFP has deployed a full-time expatriate </p><p>logistics officer to work at the Beitbridge border </p><p>crossing.  The logistics officer reports good </p><p>cooperation with GOZ authorities and that average </p><p>commercial crossing time has been reduced to ten </p><p>hours from three days during December. </p><p>Bottlenecks at the border crossing that appeared </p><p>in early March have now been resolved, and the </p><p>transit of commodities has been significantly </p><p>facilitated. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>HARARE MILL UNLIKELY TO OPEN </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Due to concerns about US-donated biotech </p><p>maize, the GOZ continues to require WFP to mill </p><p>all GM maize prior to distribution.  WFP is </p><p>currently milling approximately 12,000 MT of US </p><p>maize per month in Bulawayo, and 8,000 MT per </p><p>month in South Africa.  Because of adequate </p><p>current capacity in Bulawayo and South Africa at </p><p>this stage, remaining stocks of maize are not </p><p>expected to necessitate the use of additional </p><p>milling sites in Harare or Gweru. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>CURRENT RESOURCES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Zimbabwe portion of WFP\'s EMOP 10200.0 </p><p>for Southern Africa has been 83 percent resourced. </p><p>As of March 10, WFP had received commitments of </p><p>375,759 MT of food commodities.  The total appeal </p><p>under EMOP 10200.0 was for 452,955 MT.  If WFP </p><p>receives new commitments equal to the 77,196 MT </p><p>shortfall, WFP reports that it will have </p><p>sufficient commodities to meet beneficiary </p><p>requirements through the end of June 2003.  The </p><p>United States remains the largest single donor, </p><p>pledging 136,873 MT, valued at about $67 million, </p><p>towards EMOP 10200.0, or about 36% of total donor </p><p>pledges to date.  Since February 2002, the United </p><p>States has committed a total of 165,493 MT of food </p><p>commodities to WFP\'s two EMOPs 10200.0 and </p><p>10140.0, valued at more than $82 million. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WFP has accepted a pledge of 100,000 MT of </p><p>maize from South Africa for the current food </p><p>security crisis in Southern Africa.  WFP expects </p><p>that approximately 64,000 MT of this maize will be </p><p>designated for Zimbabwe.  South Africa, however, </p><p>is not able to provide the necessary funding to </p><p>transport the commodities to Zimbabwe or deliver </p><p>them to the final delivery points.  DFID </p><p>(Department for International Development)-UK and </p><p>the Norwegian Government have pledged to cover a </p><p>significant portion of these transport costs, and </p><p>other donors are being sought to cover the </p><p>remaining gap.
