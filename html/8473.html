<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 002449 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION SPECIAL: PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>PROPOSED TRIP TO KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY: The postponement of a June Presidential visit to </p><p>Kuwait has generated front-page coverage and commentary in </p><p>all Arabic dailies. Although some pique is evident, a number </p><p>of liberal commentators use the cancellation to criticize </p><p>the government for failing to adopt progressive domestic </p><p>policies. "What would President Bush do if he visited </p><p>Kuwait?" writes liberal lawyer Hassan al Issa.  "Will he be </p><p>coming to shake hands with the killers of the two American </p><p>civilians near Camp Doha (or) listen to Kuwaiti women at the </p><p>National Assembly?" Another writes, "Can\'t our American </p><p>friends be frank with the Kuwaiti leadership with regards to </p><p>their demands and what they believe to be useful steps to </p><p>reform, not only in the economic field, but also in the </p><p>political and security fields?"   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>1.   News stories: On May 31, Al-Qabas reported on its front </p><p>page that Kuwaiti political circles were "astonished" that </p><p>Kuwait was left out of the President\'s regional tour. </p><p> </p><p>On June 1, all newspapers report Acting Prime Minister </p><p>Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed\'s announcement that President Bush has </p><p>"delayed but not cancelled" his visit to Kuwait, originally </p><p>scheduled for early June, due in part to security concerns. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report on June 3 that when asked if Kuwait </p><p>was upset that Qatar was on the President\'s itinerary but </p><p>Kuwait was not, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr. </p><p>Sheikh Mohammed Al-Sabah said, "Kuwait and Doha are one, and </p><p>we act as one country within our GCC framework." </p><p> </p><p>3.  "What Is It To Kuwait If Bush Doesn\'t Visit?" </p><p>Liberal Editor-in-Chief of Al-Rai Al-Aam, Jassim Boodai </p><p>opined (5/31): "The lives of Kuwaitis and the Kuwaiti </p><p>economy will not collapse if President Bush postpones or </p><p>calls off his visit to Kuwait due to security reasons, as </p><p>the Americans claim. President Bush is welcome in Kuwait, </p><p>but we did not play a role in the liberation of Iraq as a </p><p>favor to him or America. Rather, we did it for the sake of </p><p>the Iraqis. because a glance from an Iraqi child towards </p><p>Kuwait\'s humanitarian assistance is better than a protocol </p><p>meeting, even with the master of the White House." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Why Are We Angry At Being Ignored?" </p><p>Liberal Lawyer Hassan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(6/01): "President Bush has overlooked Kuwait, and removed </p><p>Kuwait from his itinerary. Instead, he will be heading to </p><p>Qatar. What would President Bush do if he visits Kuwait?  . </p><p>Will he be coming to shake hands with the killers of the two </p><p>American civilians near Camp Doha, or with the killers of </p><p>the American Marine on Failaka Island? Is Mr. Bush coming to </p><p>witness how Kuwait has acted on US advice to be cautious of </p><p>the Islamic currents in Kuwait, or is he coming to listen to </p><p>Kuwait\'s women at the National Assembly? So, do we have the </p><p>right to be angry if Kuwait is not included in his trip to </p><p>the region?" </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Skipping Kuwait" </p><p>Liberal Dr. Shamlan Al-Essa, Chairman of Political Science </p><p>Department at Kuwait University, wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Seyassah (6/01): "President Bush\'s decision to travel to </p><p>Qatar instead of Kuwait has several political dimensions </p><p>that are not remotely linked to security. How did Qatar </p><p>succeed in befriending America? . Qatar took the shortest </p><p>route to gaining America\'s friendship by moving closer to </p><p>Israel. Qatar fully ignored all Arab and GCC resolutions, </p><p>and its Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim met with </p><p>the Israeli Foreign Minister. The United States is currently </p><p>playing a major role in changing the regimes of the region, </p><p>therefore, there is no room for those who are hesitant, </p><p>fearful or trade in slogans." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "Are We Going To Wake Up Before It\'s Too Late?" </p><p>Liberal former Oil Minister and former MP Ahmad Al-Baghli </p><p>wrote in independent Al-Qabas (6/01): "Many people </p><p>sympathized with [Al-Qaeda official spokesperson Sulaiman] </p><p>Bu Gaith. Had it been left to our kind-hearted government, </p><p>he would have been totally pardoned. Our government has </p><p>actually assisted fundamentalist youths. Bu Gaith and others </p><p>who hold Kuwaiti citizenship and openly spread their poison </p><p>in newspapers and over the Internet and incite people to </p><p>violence are responsible for the belief that Kuwait is </p><p>unsafe and insecure, thus excluding Kuwait from President </p><p>Bush\'s tour of the region." </p><p>7.  "Does Terrorism Deserve Such Exaggeration?" </p><p>Liberal Dr. Ayed Al-Manna wrote in independent Al-Watan </p><p>(6/4):  "British Prime Minister Tony Blair paid a quick </p><p>visit to Kuwait and then crossed over to Iraq. What then </p><p>justifies the recommendation of US intelligence to President </p><p>Bush that he cancel or postpone his trip to Kuwait? Is there </p><p>doubt as to the effectiveness of Kuwaiti security, or is </p><p>this decision based on political, not security, </p><p>considerations? If this is the case, is the cancellation or </p><p>postponement a form of low-key objection?  Can\'t our </p><p>American friends be frank with the Kuwaiti leadership with </p><p>regards to their demands and what they believe to be useful </p><p>steps to reform, not only in the economic field, but also in </p><p>the political and security fields?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
