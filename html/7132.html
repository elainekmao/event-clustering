SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The province of Newfoundland-Labrador </p><p>believes its exporters of fish and other perishable products </p><p>should get special consideration when the USG implements new FDA </p><p>border measures to combat bioterrorism.  Newfoundland, which </p><p>depends heavily on its export of freshly caught and live seafood </p><p>to U.S. markets, believes that some of the proposed new </p><p>regulations would severely hamper this trade.  Echoing the </p><p>concerns of the other Atlantic provinces (REFTEL), Newfoundland </p><p>is pressing for the USG to adopt a shorter time requirement for </p><p>notification of perishable shipments crossing the border. </p><p>Newfoundland is also seeking a rule change that would exempt its </p><p>large fish-processing companies from the "one physical location" </p><p>definition, as well as a reconsideration of the definition of </p><p>"originating country".  (END SUMMARY) </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Newfoundland-Labrador\'s Minister of Fisheries made an </p><p>impromptu call on the CG on April 4 to personally relay her </p><p>province\'s apprehensions over future USG regulations emanating </p><p>from the Bioterrorism Act, which will have a significant impact </p><p>on the provinceQs lucrative export of freshly caught and live </p><p>seafood to the United States.  Minister Yvonne Jones, who just </p><p>joined the cabinet of Premier Roger Grimes in February, </p><p>explained that Newfoundland has strong reasons for being </p><p>concerned about the new regulations because it is in a more </p><p>difficult position than any other Canadian province.  Unlike its </p><p>three regional counterparts, Newfoundland\'s fishing industry is </p><p>the mainstay of the province, with a landed value of over C$1 </p><p>billion annually.  Of those products, approximately 70 to 80 </p><p>percent are exported to the United States, making Newfoundland </p><p>extremely vulnerable to constraints in cross-border shipments. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Unlike other Atlantic provinces, NewfoundlandQs </p><p>exporters must get their U.S.-bound perishable products first to </p><p>Nova Scotia by ocean ferry before sending them by truck overland </p><p>to the Maine-New Brunswick border.  Severe weather conditions </p><p>often disrupt the ferry schedule, consequently increasing the </p><p>total transit time to the U.S. border.  Minister Jones argued </p><p>that these conditions often make it impossible to estimate </p><p>arrival times of perishable fish products, and that exporters </p><p>would be unable to adhere to new regulations requiring a strict </p><p>24-hour advance notification for shipments arriving at the U.S. </p><p>border. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Newfoundland government, more so than its regional </p><p>counterparts, is therefore making a strong case that the FDA </p><p>allow for two categories of products---perishable and non- </p><p>perishable---in determining pre-notification time of imports, </p><p>allowing shorter advance notification for perishable ones. </p><p>Minister Jones also pointed out that the requirement that a U.S. </p><p>agent submit the advance prior notice was additionally </p><p>cumbersome, but she acknowledged that most Newfoundland shippers </p><p>could comply. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Another major problem, the Minister explained, is that </p><p>the fish-processing industry in Newfoundland is in the hands of </p><p>a few very large companies which operate facilities in several </p><p>different locations in the province.  Often these facilities </p><p>operate under different company names, reflecting the product </p><p>they produce.  As such, each would require separate registration </p><p>as proposed by the draft FDA regulations.  The Minister is </p><p>proposing an amendment to those regulations that would modify </p><p>the "one physical location" definition to allow for multi-plant </p><p>operators.  This would enable the large parent companies to </p><p>continue to co-mingle their products regardless of where in the </p><p>province they were produced. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Finally, Newfoundland would have unique difficulties </p><p>with the draft requirement concerning identification of </p><p>originating country.  Due to ongoing declines in Newfoundland\'s </p><p>groundfishery, companies have to rely on purchases of raw fish </p><p>product "on the water" from vessels flagged in a variety of </p><p>countries, predominately Russia and Norway.  All the raw fish, </p><p>however, is handled and processed the same way as domestic </p><p>supplies, subject to the same quality control and safety </p><p>measures.  Consequently, the Minister made a strong case that </p><p>exports be permitted to identify Canada as the originating </p><p>country, instead of listing the country under which the </p><p>harvesting vessel is flagged. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) COMMENT:  NewfoundlandQs predicament, although perhaps </p><p>a bit more dire than that of the other three Atlantic provinces, </p><p>reflects similar concerns about the potentially devastating </p><p>impact of new bioterrorism regulations on Canadian perishable </p><p>exports to U.S. markets.  All four Atlantic premiers have signed </p><p>a joint letter to Deputy PM Manley urging Ottawa to lobby for </p><p>the necessary rule changes with his U.S. interlocutors.  The </p><p>Newfoundland provincial government has also delivered its </p><p>concerns directly to FDA in the form of a letter signed by the </p><p>Minister on March 31.   Newfoundland now joins Nova Scotia in </p><p>having lobbied the CG directly in the hope of getting the </p><p>Ambassador to weight in with senior FDA officials on these </p><p>proposed modifications.   CG responded that the Ambassador and </p><p>the U.S. Mission in Canada are aware of these Canadian concerns, </p><p>which the Fisheries Council of Canada and the Nova Scotia Fish </p><p>PackersQ Association have also raised in the form of feedback to </p><p>the FDA, and that we are confident that FDA will take into </p><p>consideration the modifications proposed by these Canadian </p><p>organizations and by the affected provinces. </p><p>KASHKETT </p><p></p></div>
