<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RIYADH 01865 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USIA FOR NEA - RUGH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KISL, PROP, PREL, IZ, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISLAM AT THE JIHAD CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY: WHILE ISLAM WAS A CENTRAL SUBJECT AT </p><p>LAST WEEK\'S JIHAD CONVENTION IN RIYADH, DISCUSSIONS </p><p>GENERALLY REPEATED THE SAME POINTS EMPHASIZED BY SAUDI </p><p>RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES SINCE LAST AUGUST.  THE IRAQI </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AND ESPECIALLY THE BAATH PARTY, WERE ROUNDLY </p><p>CONDEMNED BY ALL SPEAKERS, ALTHOUGH ONLY A FEW HAD </p><p>SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN.  ALL SPEAKERS </p><p>ALSO HAD STRONG PRAISE FOR THE AL SAUD AND THE COALITION </p><p>EFFORT, AND ALL LISTED THE NUMEROUS REWARDS FOR THOSE WHO </p><p>WAGED OR SUPPORTED JIHAD.  THE ONLY CONTROVERSIAL MOMENT </p><p>CAME WHEN AN ANONYMOUS WRITTEN COMMENT SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>MOST ISLAMIC SCHOLARS IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES SUPPORT </p><p>SADDAM.  AFTER ONE SHEIKH TRIED TO BLAME JEALOUSY OF </p><p>SAUDI WEALTH AND IRAQI PROPAGANDA FOR SUCH SUPPORT, TWO </p><p>SENIOR SAUDI RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARGUED STRONGLY THAT MOST </p><p>SCHOLARS IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES IN FACT SUPPORT SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA.  NONETHELESS, THE STYLE AND SUBSTANCE OF </p><p>DISCUSSION SEEMED TO REFLECT UNITED SUPPORT FOR SAG </p><p>POSITIONS ON THE GULF CRISIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  ALMOST ANY LARGE MEETING IN SAUDI ARABIA WILL </p><p>INVOKE ISLAM AS A PRINCIPLE THEME, AND THE RECENT JIHAD </p><p>CONVENTION AT RIYADH\'S IMAM MOHAMED BIN SAUD ISLAMIC </p><p>UNIVERSITY WAS NO EXCEPTION.  AS EXPECTED, ALL SESSIONS </p><p>AND SPEAKERS MENTIONED THE PROPERLY ISLAMIC NATURE OF THE </p><p>KINGDOM\'S CURRENT JIHAD.  COMMENT: IT IS WORTH RECALLING </p><p>THAT, WHILE JIHAD IS USUALLY TRANSLATED AS "HOLY WAR," </p><p>ITS MORE LITERAL MEANING IS THAT OF "STRUGGLE."  AMONG </p><p>MANY SUNNI POPULATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE CONSERVATIVE </p><p>WAHHABI CIRCLES OF SAUDI ARABIA, JIHAD CAN ALSO DESCRIBE </p><p>THE EFFORTS OF MUSLIMS TO FOLLOW ISLAM DURING A </p><p>PARTICULARLY TRYING TIME OR SITUATION.  BOTH THESE </p><p>RELATED USES OF JIHAD WERE IN EVIDENCE THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>CONVENTION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE MOST DIRECT COMMENTS ON ISLAM WERE MADE </p><p>DURING A PANEL DISCUSSION ENTITLED "JIHAD IN THE GULF IS </p><p>A DEFENSE OF RELIGION AND THE HOLY PLACES."  THREE SENIOR </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS </p><p>(ULEMA) WERE ON THE PANEL: SHEIKH SALEH BIN MOHAMMAD </p><p>AL-LEHEIDAN, SHEIKH ABDULAZIZ BIN ABDULLAH AL ASH-SHEIKH, </p><p>AND SHEIKH SALEH BIN FAWZAN AL-FAWZAN.  OTHER </p><p>PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED: SHEIKH MANNA AL-QAHTAN, A </p><p>NATURALIZED SAUDI FROM SYRIA; KUWAITI SHEIKH AHMAD </p><p>AL-QAHTAN (NO RELATION TO MANNA), ONE OF THE BEST-KNOWN </p><p>RELIGIOUS SPEAKERS IN THE GULF REGION; SHEIKH MOHAMMED </p><p>ABDALLAH AS-SUBAYYEL, DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>HAJJ AND ENDOWMENTS\' DEPARTMENT FOR AFFAIRS OF THE TWO </p><p>HOLY MOSQUES; AND DR. ABDALLAH BIN MOHAMED AL-AJLAN OF </p><p>THE IMAM MOHAMED UNIVERSITY FACULTY.  ANOTHER FACULTY </p><p>MEMBER, DR. RASHED BIN RAJIH AL-RAJIH, SERVED AS </p><p>MODERATOR.  NUMEROUS OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS WERE IN THE </p><p>AUDIENCE, INCLUDING UNIVERSITY RECTOR DR. ABDALLAH BIN </p><p>ABDULMOHSEN AL-TURKI AND SENIOR SAUDI RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR </p><p>ABDULAZIZ BIN ABDALLAH BIN BAZ. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  THE THREE SUPREME COUNCIL MEMBERS STRESSED THE </p><p>SAME THEMES THAT THEY HAVE IN VIRTUALLY ALL THEIR PUBLIC </p><p>APPEARANCES SINCE LAST AUGUST.  ALL WERE QUICK TO </p><p>CRITICIZE THE "EVIL" IRAQI ACTIONS IN BOTH IRAQ AND </p><p>KUWAIT SINCE THE INVASION, GENERALLY PLACING BLAME FOR </p><p>ALL PROBLEMS WITH THE "ATHEIST" BAATH PARTY AND ONLY </p><p>OCCASIONNALLY MENTIONING KUWAIT OR SADDAM.  AS-SUBAYYEL </p><p>REMINDED THE AUDIENCE SEVERAL TIMES THAT JIHAD IS FOUGHT </p><p>NOT ONLY THROUGH ACTION BUT THROUGH DEED AND THOUGHT AS </p><p>WELL.  AL-LEHEIDAN, WHOSE PERIODIC APPEARANCES ON SAUDI </p><p>TV AND RADIO SINCE AUGUST HAVE BEEN WELL-RECEIVED, WAS </p><p>ATYPICALLY GENERAL IN HIS REMARKS, STRESSING THE REWARDS </p><p>FOR THOSE WHO BECOME MARTYRS DURING JIHAD.  AL ASH-SHEIKH </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE IRAQI BAATHISTS HAD ACHIEVED WHAT </p><p>THE CHRISTIANS AND JEWS NEVER COULD: THE "DISINTEGRATION" </p><p>OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  OTHER SWEEPING CONDEMNATIONS WERE </p><p>MADE OF SOCIALISM AND PAN-ARABISM, AND SOME SPEAKERS </p><p>(NOTABLY DR. AL-AJLAN) STRESSED THE NEED FOR A </p><p>REUNIFICATION OF ALL THE MUSLIM NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE BEST-RECEIVED OF THE SPEAKERS WAS </p><p>UNQUESTIONABLY SHEIKH AHMED AL-QAHTAN OF KUWAIT.  LIKE </p><p>HIS FIRE-AND-BRIMSTONE TAPES CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>GULF STATES, AL-QAHTAN WAS MUCH LOUDER, MORE FORCEFUL AND </p><p>DIRECT THAN HIS SAUDI COLLEAGUES.  HE SAID THE AFGHANS </p><p>AND PALESTINIANS WERE THE MAIN VICTIMS OF SADDAM AND THAT </p><p>ISRAEL WOULD BE THE ONLY WINNER OF THE WAR.  HE SAID </p><p>ISRAEL HAD RECEIVED SUBSTANTIAL AID FROM THE U.S., </p><p>GERMANY, AND JAPAN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CRISIS, AND </p><p>CONTRASTED THAT SUPPORT TO THE LOST SIXTEEN MILLION </p><p>DOLLARS A MONTH THAT THE PALESTINIANS USED TO RECEIVE </p><p>FROM SAUDI ARABIA.  AL-QAHTAN CONCLUDED WITH A STATEMENT </p><p>HE SAID WAS MADE BY KING ABDULAZIZ AL SAUD IN 1933:  "I </p><p>DO NOT FEAR THE FOREIGNERS AS I FEAR THE MUSLIMS BECAUSE </p><p>OUR PROBLEMS WILL COME FROM THE MUSLIMS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  ENSUING COMMENTARY FROM THE FLOOR OF THE </p><p>CONVENTION WAS MADE BY VARIOUS FOREIGN GUESTS WHO </p><p>REPEATEDLY PRAISED THE AL SAUD IN GENERAL AND KING FAHD </p><p>IN PARTICULAR.  ONE SUDANESE DELEGATE PRAISED KING </p><p>ABDULAZIZ FOR "CIVILIZING THE BEDOUIN" BY TEACHING THEM </p><p>MODERN WAYS, A COMMENT NOT WELCOMED BY THE </p><p>TRADITIONALLY-MINDED AUDIENCE.  ANOTHER SOURCE OF </p><p>DISCOMFORT FOR THE CONSERVATIVES ATTENDING WAS THE </p><p>ASSERTION BY EGYPTIAN PROFESSOR DR. MUSTAFA ASH-SHAKA </p><p>THAT THE CURRENT PROBLEM WAS NOT WITH SADDAM BUT WITH THE </p><p>PROCESS WHICH BROUGHT SADDAM TO POWER.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>SIMILAR MEN WOULD RISE TO POWER IF PRINCIPLES OF </p><p>"CONSULTATION" (SHURA) WERE NOT IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE MUSLIM WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  AFTERWARDS, WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED </p><p>ANONYMOUSLY FROM THE AUDIENCE WERE READ, WITH ANSWERS </p><p>PROVIDED BY PANEL MEMBERS.  ONE QUESTION ASKED FOR AN </p><p>EXPLANATION OF THE PRO-SADDAM POSITION TAKEN BY MOST </p><p>ULEMA OUTSIDE SAUDI ARABIA.  AFTER AS-SUBAYYEL ATTRIBUTED </p><p>SUCH POSITIONS TO TRICKERY BY SADDAM OR ENVY OF SAUDI </p><p>WEALTH, DR. AL-TURKI INTERRUPTED TO SAY THAT MOST ULEMA </p><p>OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM IN FACT DID NOT SUPPORT SADDAM.  HE </p><p>ASCRIBED REPORTS OF ANTI-SAUDI FEELING IN OTHER COUNTRIES </p><p>TO WESTERN MEDIA DISTORTIONS AND TO THE PRO-SADDAM </p><p>POSITION TAKEN BY SOME GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION.  SHEIKH </p><p>BIN BAZ ALSO DENIED THE PREMISE OF THE QUESTION, SAYING </p><p>THAT HE DAILY RECEIVED CABLES FROM ULEMA ALL OVER THE </p><p>WORLD IN SUPPORT OF SAUDI POSITIONS AND ACTIVITIES.  BIN </p><p>BAZ REPEATED THE RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATION FOR MUSLIMS TO </p><p>SEEK THE ASSISTANCE OF NON-MUSLIMS FOR A JIHAD. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) OTHER SESSIONS OF THE CONFERENCE REPEATED MANY OF </p><p>THE POINTS MENTIONED ABOVE, TYING THEM INTO THE TOPIC AT </p><p>HAND.  AMONG THE MORE IMAGINATIVE ARGUMENTS WAS A CLAIM </p><p>THAT BAATH PARTY FOUNDER MICHEL AFLAQ WAS A JEW; </p><p>THEREFORE, SAID THE SPEAKER, THE BAATH PARTY WAS ONE OF </p><p>THE GREATEST DANGERS CURRENTLY FACING THE MUSLIM WORLD. </p><p>OTHERS WERE MORE CIRCUMSPECT IN THEIR CRITICISMS, </p><p>GENERALLY ARGUING THAT SADDAM\'S WAR HAS DISTRACTED THE </p><p>MUSLIMS FROM OTHER PROBLEMS FACED BY MUSLIMS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN OR THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE SLIGHTLY CONTROVERSIAL MOMENTS </p><p>DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE NOT PARTICULARLY EXTREME AND, LIKE </p><p>THE ENTIRE CONVENTION, ARE MOST NOTEWORTHY IN THAT THEY </p><p>HAPPENED AT ALL.  THE COMMENTS BY THE EGYPTIAN AND </p><p>SUDANESE DELEGATES SHOW THAT FOREIGNERS WERE NOT </p><p>PROHIBITED FROM SPEAKING THEIR MINDS, ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>PROFESSOR CAREFULLY AVOIDED USING THE WORD "DEMOCRACY" IN </p><p>HIS TALK.  IN MOST OTHER WAYS, THOUGH, THE DISCUSSION WAS </p><p>TYPICALLY SAUDI, WITH QURANIC INVECTIVE MIXED AMONG CALLS </p><p>FOR MUSLIM STEADFASTNESS IN THE MODERN WORLD (SOMETIMES </p><p>WITH CORRESPONDING CALLS TO OPPOSE ZIONISM AND </p><p>IMPERIALISM). </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  OF SOMEWHAT GREATER INTEREST WAS THE INTERPLAY </p><p>BETWEEN THE RELIGIOUS FIGURES AT THE CONVENTION, </p><p>ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THOSE ON THE PANEL AND BIN BAZ. </p><p>UNLIKE THE PANEL OF MEDIA FIGURES (REPORTED SEPTEL), </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE RELIGIOUS PANEL NEVER OPENLY DISAGREED </p><p>WITH ONE ANOTHER.  AT MOST, THEY RAISED SUPPLEMENTAL </p><p>POINTS THROUGH THE USE OF SOMEWHAT NEBULOUS ANALOGIES OR </p><p>QURANIC REFERENCES.  BIN BAZ RECEIVED FAR MORE RESPECT </p><p>THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDITORIUM, SOMETIMES </p><p>INTERRUPTING TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL QURANIC REFERENCE AND </p><p>SOMETIMES BEING CALLED ON BY THE MODERATOR FOR </p><p>COMMENTARY.  BOTH THE MODERATOR AND THE PANEL REFERRED TO </p><p>BIN BAZ AS "OUR FATHER" (WALIDNA) AND WERE ALWAYS READY </p><p>WITH EFFUSIVE PRAISE FOR POINTS RAISED BY THE SENIOR </p><p>SHEIKH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FREEMAN </p><p></p></div>
