END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. THE UN\'S INTER-AGENCY STANDING COMMITTEE (IASC) IS </p><p>COMPRISED OF UN MEMBER AGENCIES: FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION (FAO); UN OFFICE FOR THE COORDINATION OF </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS (OCHA); UN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP); </p><p>UN POPULATION FUND (UNFPA); UN CHILDREN\'S FUND (UNICEF); UN </p><p>HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR); WORLD FOOD PROGRAM </p><p>(WFP); AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO). STANDING </p><p>INVITEES INCLUDE: INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS </p><p>(ICRC); INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF VOLUNTARY AGENCIES </p><p>(ICVA); INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE RED CROSS AND RED </p><p>CRESCENT (IFRC); INTER-ACTION; INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION </p><p>FOR MIGRATION (IOM); STANDING COMMITTEE ON HUMANITARIAN </p><p>RESPONSE (SCHR); UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>(UNHCHR); AND THE WORLD BANK). </p><p> </p><p>3. WHILE MEETING IN ROME APRIL 9-10, THE IASC FOCUSED INTER </p><p>ALIA ON THE EMERGING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. </p><p>IT EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THIS </p><p>REGION WILL REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN 2002. THE PRESENT FOOD SECURITY SITUATION IN </p><p>THE REGION IS ADJUDGED THE WORST SINCE 1992. FACTORS </p><p>CONTRIBUTING TO THE PRESENT CRISIS ARE NUMEROUS AND VARY </p><p>FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. THEY INCLUDE: DROUGHT, FLOODS, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01982  01 OF 02  230747Z </p><p>DISRUPTIONS TO COMMERCIAL FARMING, DEPLETION OF STRATEGIC </p><p>GRAIN RESERVES, POOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE </p><p>SHORTAGES AND DELAYS IN THE TIMELY IMPORTATION OF MAIZE. </p><p>SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF MAIZE HAVE UNDERMINED </p><p>ACCESS TO FOOD FOR LARGE SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WITHIN </p><p>THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE EMERGING CRISIS IS COMPOUNDED BY THE HIGH PREVALENCE </p><p>OF HIV/AIDS. INADEQUATE FOOD AVAILABILITY AND CONSUMPTION </p><p>PLACES AN EVEN GREATER STRAIN ON THOSE AFFECTED BY HIV/AIDS </p><p>AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS STRUGGLING TO CARE FOR THEM. HIV/AIDS </p><p>INCREASES HOUSEHOLD VULNERABILITY TO FOOD INSECURITY BY </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING WORKING AGE PEOPLE. IT REDUCES </p><p>THE AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF LAND CULTIVATED AS WELL AS INCOMES </p><p>AND PURCHASING POWER FOR THOSE EMPLOYED IN OTHER SECTORS. IT </p><p>ALSO ADDS TO THE DISEASE BURDEN (TUBERCULOSIS, MALARIA AND </p><p>OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES) THAT THE POPULATION FACES ALONG </p><p>WITH THE FOOD INSECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>FAO/WFP JOINT CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY ASSESSMENT MISSIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8410 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01982  02 OF 02  230747Z </p><p>ACTION PRM-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   UTED-00  TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   TEST-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------8A2930  230749Z /38 </p><p>P 230641Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 3379 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERN </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2103 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2634 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001982 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR A/S/PRM, PRM/P, AF/S AND IO/D </p><p>USAID FOR A/AID, AA/DCHA, AA/AFR, DCHA/FFP, DCHA/OFDA </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN AND MCHAMBLISS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01982  02 OF 02  230747Z </p><p>NAIROBI FOR REDSO AND DCHA/OFDA </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA AND NKYLOH/USAID </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR KFULLER AND KDEBLAW </p><p>PRETORIA FOR USDA/FAS HELM </p><p>USUN FOR LSHESTACK </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, EAGR, AORC, WFP, UN, PREF, PHUM, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: UN INTER-AGENCY STANDING COMMITTEE STATEMENT ON </p><p>GROWING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN THE SOUTHERN AFRICA REGION </p><p> </p><p>5. ALTHOUGH THE APPROACHING HARVEST SEASON (APRIL-JUNE) </p><p>SHOULD PROVIDE SHORT-TERM RELIEF FOR SOME OF THE 2.7 MILLION </p><p>PERSONS CURRENTLY AFFECTED, MANY VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO REQUIRE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. FOR MANY </p><p>VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, ASSETS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEPLETED </p><p>AND COPING STRATEGIES EXHAUSTED. THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2002 AND INTO EARLY 2003 IS EXPECTED </p><p>TO SIGNIFICANTLY WORSEN IN MALAWI, ZAMBIA AND ZIMBABWE. </p><p>HOUSEHOLDS IN POCKETS OF LESOTHO, MOZAMBIQUE AND SWAZILAND </p><p>ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING SERIOUS FOOD SHORTAGES. AMONG THOSE </p><p>AFFECTED ARE 125,000 REFUGEES IN MALAWI AND ZAMBIA WHO </p><p>DEPEND UPON FOOD AID FOR THEIR SURVIVAL. NOTE: AS PER THE </p><p>IASC, THE 117,000 REFUGEES IN ZAMBIA HAVE ONLY RECEIVED HALF </p><p>RATIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR DUE TO GAPS IN </p><p>RESOURCING. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>6. JOINT FAO/WFP ASSESSMENT MISSIONS FOCUSING ON CROP </p><p>PRODUCTION, ACCESS TO FOOD AND OTHER ESSENTIAL NEEDS, SUCH </p><p>AS NUTRITION AND HEALTH, ARE PRESENTLY UNDERWAY (APRIL-MAY) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01982  02 OF 02  230747Z </p><p>IN LESOTHO, MALAWI, MOZAMBIQUE, SWAZILAND, ZAMBIA, </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE, ANGOLA AND ZIMBABWE - TO QUANTIFY THE DIMENSIONS </p><p>OF THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS BOTH WITHIN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES </p><p>AND REGIONALLY. IASC STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF MONITORING </p><p>EARLY WARNING INFORMATION RELATED TO A POSSIBLE EL NINO </p><p>"EVENT." IF ANOTHER MAJOR WEATHER PHENOMENON WERE TO OCCUR, </p><p>ERRATIC RAINFALL AND OTHER CLIMATIC SHOCKS COULD FURTHER </p><p>UNDERMINE CROP PRODUCTION AND FOOD SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>7. WFP HAS BEEN GIVEN THE LEAD IN CONSULTING WITH AGENCIES </p><p>IN THE REGION REGARDING THE CRISIS. FURTHER, IASC DECIDED </p><p>THAT THERE WOULD BE A UNITED NATIONS-ORGANIZED MEETING IN </p><p>THE REGION IN LATE MAY TO REVIEW THE FINDINGS OF THE FAO/WFP </p><p>CROP ASSESSMENT MISSIONS AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE </p><p>ISSUANCE OF A UN CONSOLIDATED APPEAL (CAP) FOR THE REGION IS </p><p>WARRANTED. </p><p> </p><p>8. FINALLY, IASC REPEATED ITS COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH </p><p>AFFECTED GOVERNMENTS AND REGIONAL PARTNERS ON MULTI-SECTORAL </p><p>ASSESSMENTS OF NEEDS, THE DESIGN OF APPROPRIATE RESPONSE </p><p>STRATEGIES AND IN ENSURING EFFECTIVE COORDINATION OF ALL </p><p>INTERVENTIONS, INCLUDING LOGISTICS, RELATED TO THE DELIVERY </p><p>OF URGENTLY NEEDED RELIEF CARGO. THE COMMITTEE ALSO CALLED </p><p>UPON THE INTERNATIONAL DONOR COMMUNITY TO HELP PREVENT THE </p><p>CURRENT CRISIS FROM BECOMING A HUMANITARIAN DISASTER. THE </p><p>IASC EMPHASIZED THAT, WITH PROMPT RESPONSE FROM THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THIS CRISIS CAN BE AVERTED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01982  02 OF 02  230747Z </p><p> </p><p>9. THERE WAS GENERAL IASC-CONSENSUS THAT SOUTHERN AFRICA WAS </p><p>BEING IMPACTED BY A MULTI-SECTORAL HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND </p><p>NOT JUST A PROBLEM OF FOOD SHORTAGES.  IN ADDITION TO TIMELY </p><p>PROVISION OF FOOD, NON-FOOD REQUIREMENTS ALSO NEEDED TO BE </p><p>FOCUSED ON. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE UN AGENCIES ARE NOW </p><p>SERIOUSLY ENGAGED IN ASSESSING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM, </p><p>COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL APPROPRIATE PARTNERS, AND </p><p>IMBUED WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY.
