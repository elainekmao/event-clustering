<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000710 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>NEW DELHI PLEASE PASS A/S ROCCA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: KOIRALA COMEBACK?  IMPLICATIONS OF (YET ANOTHER) </p><p>CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0707 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0672 </p><p>     C. (C) STATE 67794 </p><p>     D. (D) 01 KATHMANDU 1603 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Refs A and B reported apparent efforts by </p><p>former Prime Minister and Nepali Congress Party President </p><p>Girija Prasad Koirala to oust current Prime Minister Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba and regain the post of prime minister--which he </p><p>has held five times in Nepal\'s twelve years of democracy--yet </p><p>again.  This message contains additional information on the </p><p>Koirala campaign and our assessment of what another Koirala </p><p>administration could mean for domestic political stability. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>SIEGE MENTALITY </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Supporters of former Prime Minister and Nepali </p><p>Congress (NC) Party President Girija Prasad Koirala, who is </p><p>stepping up his campaign to replace current Prime Minister </p><p>Sher Bahadur Deuba (Refs A and B), are indicating that the </p><p>five-time former PM may be planning a move to oust his rival </p><p>in the near future.  In an April 9 meeting with poloffs, </p><p>Sujata Koirala, G.P.\'s only child, hinted that a decision </p><p>would be made after her father and she return from an April </p><p>14-18 visit to India, where he expects to meet with (unnamed) </p><p>Indian officials.  (Note:  The Indian Ambassador to Nepal </p><p>confirmed the visit and told the British Ambassador the </p><p>Indian Government will tell Koirala to stand down.)  While </p><p>emphasizing that the decision on who leads Nepal is for </p><p>Nepalis to decide, poloffs hinted back to Sujata Koirala that </p><p>a change of government at the present could only further </p><p>erode Nepal\'s stability and undermine the GON\'s ability to </p><p>address the insurgency and other pressing national issues. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Sujata, a philanthropist and aspiring politician who </p><p>earned a reputation for corruption during her father\'s </p><p>previous administration, charged that the Royal Nepal Army </p><p>(RNA) and the King are in league against her father, and are </p><p>propping up Deuba because he is more easily manipulated than </p><p>her father would be by "anti-democratic" forces.  She </p><p>predicted the NC Central Committee will soon expel </p><p>Communications Minister Jaya Prakash Gupta for publicly </p><p>supporting Army Chief Rana\'s controversial remarks about past </p><p>Nepali Congress leaders (Ref B).  She accused the RNA of </p><p>harassing and even killing Koirala supporters in the field. </p><p>Deuba, on the other hand, has completely cut off dialogue </p><p>with the Koirala faction in his party.  When a NC MP from </p><p>Kalikot turned to Deuba to ask for assistance for his </p><p>beleaguered, Maoist-affected district, she said Deuba </p><p>peremptorily "threw him out" of his office because of his </p><p>affiliation to the Koirala camp.  To add to their woes, </p><p>Koirala supporters are also being targeted by Maoists, she </p><p>claimed, alleging the insurgents specifically ask Nepali </p><p>Congress cadres if they are Koirala men or Deuba men.  If </p><p>they respond with the former, they are attacked.  (Note: </p><p>This we strongly doubt and have not heard elsewhere.  End </p><p>note.)  Her father is not interested in regaining the prime </p><p>minister\'s chair, she asserted, but what can he do when </p><p>democracy is so threatened and district party leaders and MPs </p><p>are "crying" for him to return to power?  When poloff asked </p><p>about her father\'s relationship with the RNA and Palace </p><p>during his last administration, she brushed off the question. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>LIKELY PALACE, RNA REACTIONS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Koirala has been chipping away at Deuba\'s support </p><p>within his own faction-riven party since his term began in </p><p>July; it appears that by now Koirala might well have won over </p><p>enough MPs to win a vote of no confidence.  Opposition party </p><p>leaders are unlikely to protest or interrupt their rivals\' </p><p>self-destructiveness, discerning as always, in the NC\'s </p><p>recurrent internal crises, potential opportunity to take the </p><p>prime ministership back from the Nepali Congress.  The </p><p>general public, long inured to the self-absorbed infighting </p><p>of their political leaders and frequent flip-flops in </p><p>government, can probably be counted on to accept Koirala\'s </p><p>re-emergence with relative indifference.  Maoist reaction to </p><p>another Koirala administration is difficult to determine; it </p><p>seems unlikely, however, to produce an environment any more </p><p>conducive to dialogue than in his previous tenures.  The </p><p>Maoists almost surely welcome continual infighting within the </p><p>NC Party and among the various parties in Parliament.  We and </p><p>other donors have been quietly letting the Koirala camp know </p><p>that we regard a change in government at this crucial </p><p>juncture as ill advised (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  The other two figures in the national equation, </p><p>however--the Palace and the RNA--do not favor a Koirala </p><p>comeback. Koirala enjoyed particularly stormy relations with </p><p>the RNA during his last term in office, and he has made no </p><p>secret since of his displeasure with the military.  Chief of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Army Staff Rana\'s public comments criticizing the past 12 </p><p>years of political leadership (Ref B) made pointed implicit </p><p>references to Koirala, who served as Prime Minister for more </p><p>than half of that time.  Koirala, on the other hand, regards </p><p>the RNA\'s refusal to engage the Maoists in Rolpa last July </p><p>(Ref D)--and King Gyanendra\'s reported refusal to support his </p><p>request that the RNA do so--as evidence of a Palace-Army </p><p>conspiracy against him. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  The RNA, understandably, views the fiasco at Rolpa </p><p>differently and blames Koirala for having forced the military </p><p>into a no-win situation without the legal and Constitutional </p><p>cover of emergency powers.  Our military contacts have made </p><p>it clear that they do not trust Koirala and would not like to </p><p>see him back in power again.  While always taking care to </p><p>emphasize to us their respect for the Constitution and </p><p>democracy, our military interlocutors have also frequently </p><p>expressed frustration at what they view as the civilian </p><p>leadership\'s mismanagement of the crisis.  Should Koirala </p><p>re-insert himself as Prime Minister, we don\'t anticipate a </p><p>coup, but the mutual mistrust between the former PM and the </p><p>military would surely complicate--and could undermine--RNA </p><p>efforts to counter the insurgency under the state of </p><p>emergency.  The Maoists, of course, would welcome this </p><p>development. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S) In private conversations with the Ambassador, King </p><p>Gyanendra has made the same points--respect for democracy but </p><p>impatience with its inept leadership--as Rana.  But the King, </p><p>who has generally maintained a public posture of aloofness </p><p>from domestic politics, is letting it be known behind the </p><p>scenes that he is comfortable with Deuba but would not </p><p>welcome G.P.\'s return.  Many observers view Army Chief Rana\'s </p><p>public remarks criticizing years of Koirala\'s leadership (Ref </p><p>B)--which must surely have been vetted by the Palace </p><p>beforehand--as a not-so-veiled royal admonition to the former </p><p>PM.  The King is obviously trying to head off what he sees as </p><p>a potential crisis before it happens.  Koirala understands </p><p>the message--his supporters allude freely to his strained </p><p>relations with the Palace. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S) We remain hopeful that Koirala will have the good </p><p>sense not to pursue his agenda at this time in the face of </p><p>obvious opposition from both the military and the Palace. </p><p>Advice from the one potential ally he apparently thinks he </p><p>has left--India--could prove critical in persuading him to </p><p>desist.   But whether or not Koirala decides to follow </p><p>through, his constant conniving distracts Deuba and his </p><p>embattled Cabinet from devoting their full attention to the </p><p>other threat at hand--the Maoists. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
