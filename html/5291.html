<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000137 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  POLITICAL PARTIES AGREE ON NEED FOR "JOINT </p><p>STRUGGLE"; LITTLE ELSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) 02 KATHMANDU 1932 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) 02 KATHMANDU 1988 </p><p>     C. (C) 02 KATHMANDU 2437 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  On January 22 the leaders of four political parties, </p><p>including the two largest--the Nepali Congress and the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(UML)--announced they had decided to initiate a "joint </p><p>struggle" to protest King Gyanendra\'s October 4 dismissal of </p><p>the previous government and his subsequent appointment of an </p><p>interim Cabinet (Refs A and B).  Details of exactly what this </p><p>"struggle" will entail, however, remain sparse. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  UML Central Committee Member Bharat Mohan Adhikari </p><p>told us the four parties have formed a joint task force </p><p>charged with drafting a policy paper suggesting peaceful </p><p>programs and strategies to protect democracy, reactivate the </p><p>Constitution, which the parties maintain was neutralized by </p><p>the King\'s fiat, and "stop retrogression."  (Besides the </p><p>heavy-hitting Nepali Congress and the UML, the other two </p><p>signatories are the left-wing Peasants and Workers Party and </p><p>People\'s Front Nepal, which had a total of seven MPs in the </p><p>previous Parliament.  The National Democratic Party and the </p><p>Nepal Sadbhavana Party, the parties of the current interim </p><p>Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister respectively, were </p><p>notably excluded from the deliberations and the final </p><p>agreement.)  Adhikari said the movement will later seek </p><p>participation from the National Democratic Party and the </p><p>Nepal Sadbhavana.  Once their strategies and programs are </p><p>developed, the four parties plan to approach King Gyanendra </p><p>to request him to hand over executive power to an all-party </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  NC Spokesman Arjun Narasingh K.C. echoed the UML\'s </p><p>points about developing a joint strategy, adding that the </p><p>task force will also agree on a common "bottom line" the </p><p>parties will demand from the King.  So far, however, that </p><p>agreement continues to elude the parties, K.C. acknowledged, </p><p>as the Nepali Congress\' proposal that the former Parliament </p><p>be reinstated is not supported by any of the other three </p><p>parties, who are demanding an all-party government instead. </p><p>The parties may have to compromise on their respective </p><p>demands to reach such an agreement, K.C. suggested.  He added </p><p>that substantive work by the task force will have to be </p><p>deferred until after the February 1 UML general convention. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  People\'s Front Nepal Party Secretary Himlal Puri </p><p>emphasized that the joint movement, whatever its eventual </p><p>outline, will be peaceful.  Besides pressuring the King to </p><p>rectify a move the parties regard as unconstitutional, the </p><p>joint movement will also ask the Maoists to stop killing </p><p>innocent people and destroying infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Comment:  The parties can agree that they dislike </p><p>the King\'s action in appointing and installing an interim </p><p>non-party government; just what they can and should do about </p><p>it obviously remains a point of considerable uncertainty, </p><p>however.  Nepali Congress Party President G.P. Koirala </p><p>continues to insist on the reinstatement of Parliament, even </p><p>though the Supreme Court has already ruled the May 22 </p><p>dissolution was constitutional and even though no other party </p><p>supports that position.  Spokesman Arjun K.C.\'s conciliatory </p><p>comments notwithstanding, we have so far seen or heard little </p><p>from the upper ranks of the Nepali Congress that would </p><p>indicate a willingness to accommodate other views on this </p><p>matter.  Earlier indications that the UML might reach an </p><p>understanding with the Palace (Ref C), meanwhile, appear to </p><p>have been squelched for now by a virulent internal power </p><p>struggle within the party that can become only more </p><p>contentious as the date of the upcoming UML general </p><p>convention nears.  Political parties in Nepal do not enjoy a </p><p>strong tradition of cooperation and collaboration--even </p><p>within their own organizations.  We expect it will be some </p><p>time before the parties can reach more substantive mutual </p><p>agreement on the elements of this much-hyped initiative. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
