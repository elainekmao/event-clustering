<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001954 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: 99 PROMINENT JORDANIANS LETTER EXHORT KING </p><p>ABDULLAH TO TAKE TOUGHER STANCE AGAINST IRAQ WAR </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On March 31, Al Arab Al Yawm newspaper published an </p><p>open letter to King Abdullah, signed by 99 prominent </p><p>Jordanians, urging the King to toughen his stance against the </p><p>"U.S. aggression" in Iraq.  The letter\'s signers include </p><p>former prime ministers, ministers, deputies, former </p><p>intelligence officers, Islamists, and a communist party </p><p>leader.  The letter requests that the King condemn the </p><p>"illegitimate aggression" against Iraq and its people and </p><p>subsequently, after the war has ended, "to refuse to </p><p>recognize any political or legal outcomes of the aggression." </p><p> Anxiety about the letter and the gap between  public opinion </p><p>and Iraq policy could spark more declarations from the GOJ on </p><p>the need to end the war. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Jordanian Who\'s Who </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The letter sparked interest both for its content and </p><p>for its "who\'s who" of prominent --if historical-- Jordanian </p><p>political figures.  Among the signers are former prime </p><p>ministers Mudar Badran, Ahmad Obeidat, Taher Masri and Abdur </p><p>Ra\'uf S. Rawabdeh, former Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Majali, </p><p>Islamist activist Leith Shbeilat, an Islamist sentenced to </p><p>death for conspiring against the State in 1992, and Yacoub </p><p>Zayaddine, a veteran communist leader. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Letter\'s Request to the King </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The letter urges King Abdullah to condemn strongly </p><p>"the US aggression", citing astonishment at the lack of an </p><p>official Arab position that "rises to the level of people\'s </p><p>conscience."  The letter further states that only by standing </p><p>with Iraq, in its time of need, will Arab governments be able </p><p>to defend their own legitimacy in light of the American </p><p>aggression.  The letter, goes further by urging the King "to </p><p>refuse to recognize any political or legal outcomes of the </p><p>aggression." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Grab bag of Old Tired Issues </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The letter justifies these requests by pulling </p><p>together a tired set of knee-jerk -- but nonetheless, </p><p>emotionally powerful -- pan-Arab ideals and East Bank fears: </p><p>Arab solidarity against "aggression," the need for </p><p>"international legitimacy" (i.e. the UN), and the fear that </p><p>Israel harbors plans to expel Palestinians to Jordan.  It is </p><p>also interesting that the letter calls on the King only to </p><p>"push forward the rising international efforts that seek to </p><p>condemn the Anglo-American aggression against the land and </p><p>people of Iraq."  It does not suggest support for Saddam </p><p>Hussein or the Iraqi regime, nor does it call for expulsion </p><p>of U.S. forces from Jordan (a demand of most anti-war </p><p>activists). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Letter Causes a Stir at the Palace </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Minister for Palace Affairs Faisal al-Fayez and </p><p>Planning Minister Bassam Awadallah told the Ambassador </p><p>separately that the Palace is quite upset by the letter. </p><p>Fayez was scathing in his attack on the signatories -- saying </p><p>they each had their own personal agenda and most wanted a </p><p>job.  Although the letter\'s message will not affect the GOJ\'s </p><p>support for our effort, Fayez said, the Palace has to take </p><p>notice, since "ninety percent" of Jordanians agree with its </p><p>content.  Fayez said those in the Palace are feeling a need </p><p>to "protect the King," hinting that senior officials may </p><p>consequently make stronger calls for an end to the war and </p><p>deplore more loudly the civilian casualties. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>They just want the King to remember the past </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Peace activist and political science professor </p><p>Mohammed Kheir Mustafa told PolCouns April 1 that the letter </p><p>represents old-line East bankers\' attempt to consolidate </p><p>opposition to the war with pan-Arab slogans -- and to get the </p><p>King on board.  By contrast, human rights activist Fawsi </p><p>Samhoury (strictly protect) was uncharacteristically cynical </p><p>about the letter and those who signed it.  He said the group </p><p>was composed of political has-beens and supporters of the </p><p>late King Hussein who are now "on the outside."  He noted </p><p>wryly that many of them also have investments in Iraq which </p><p>might be hurt by a more open political and economic system </p><p>there. </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. (C) The letter is a shot across the King\'s bow by many of </p><p>his father\'s closest advisors and political supporters.  Its </p><p>directness and -- in a culture that emphasizes respect for </p><p>authority -- its rudeness have great shock value.  Two of the </p><p>signers told the press that they hoped to use the letter </p><p>merely to get the King\'s attention.  More than likely, </p><p>members of this group no longer command King Abdullah\'s </p><p>attention as they once commanded King Hussein\'s. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) That said, the letter has the potential to focus </p><p>opposition to the war, and does point out the great </p><p>disconnect between popular attitudes to the war and </p><p>government policy.  This makes the King\'s advisors very </p><p>nervous, and we are likely to see at least some of them </p><p>taking a stronger anti-war stance in public to shield </p><p>themselves and the King from public ire. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
