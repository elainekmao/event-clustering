<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000665 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  ANPP AND BUHARI FIGHT THE PARTY\'S </p><p>DISARRAY </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The ANPP, Nigeria\'s second largest party in the </p><p>1999 elections, has survived its subordinate status for the </p><p>past four years and remains the strongest opposition party. </p><p>With its power base in the North, the ANPP also has </p><p>produced the staunchest presidential challenger to </p><p>President Obasanjo, former Head of State General Muhammadu </p><p>Buhari.  It remains now for the party to capitalize on </p><p>fissures within the PDP and on public disenchantment with </p><p>the Obasanjo Administration to expand its support base to </p><p>challenge the PDP in its strongholds, particularly in the </p><p>South-South and the Southeast.  While Buhari faces an </p><p>uphill battle against Obasanjo, the ANPP and other </p><p>opposition parties may snatch a few gubernatorial and </p><p>numerous National Assembly seats from the PDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) To exploit the PDP divisions, the ANPP must first </p><p>heal its own wounds.  The party suffers discord along two </p><p>major lines.  While ANPP governors are all Northerners, the </p><p>ANPP enjoys support in the southeast and the south-south </p><p>regions.  In some states in these two zones, the party is </p><p>believed to have done better in 1999 than the actual vote </p><p>count would suggest; but the net result of vote rigging by </p><p>both parties favored the PDP more than the ANPP.  However, </p><p>the heavy-handed antics of northern governors at the helm </p><p>of the party have alienated some grassroots support both in </p><p>the south and to a lesser degree in the north.  The second </p><p>rift is between Buhari and the new party chairman Don </p><p>Etiebet. Buhari is a no-nonsense former military dictator </p><p>from the north who can be a martinet.  He gives no quarter </p><p>and expects none. Etiebet is a seasoned southern politician </p><p>who has prospered on a diet of "scratch my back, I\'ll </p><p>scratch yours" politics.  The two men come from different </p><p>worlds and it was difficult to get them into complementary </p><p>orbit.  However, opposition to Obasanjo and the realization </p><p>that their destinies are linked has smoothed some of the </p><p>rough spots and brought them closer together. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Northern Races </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Some Northern gubernatorial races are shaping up to </p><p>be serious challenges to the ruling PDP.  In Katsina, </p><p>Kaduna and Plateau, and to a lesser extent Bauchi, the ANPP </p><p>has a chance to pick up the top statewide office. In other </p><p>areas, however, the party faces embarrassment.  In Jigawa, </p><p>an ANPP stronghold, a divisive primary has not been </p><p>resolved.  The unpopular incumbent has been forced on the </p><p>state party.  In Zamfara, the governor is facing growing </p><p>disillusionment with his candidacy, as much a factor of </p><p>dissatisfaction with Shari\'a implementation as an </p><p>indictment of the Governor\'s languid performance.  Kwara </p><p>has been a hot race, with the ANPP incumbent locked in a </p><p>contest of wills with the son of the state kingpin who </p><p>jumped to the ruling PDP.  In Adamawa, the home state of </p><p>incumbent Vice President Atiku Abubakar, the incumbent PDP </p><p>governor is unpopular, devoid of charisma and facing a </p><p>stiff challenge from a well know politician who is in the </p><p>ANPP.  In Plateau, a PDP Governor, who is intensely </p><p>disliked, faces an uphill battle with strong candidates </p><p>from both the ANPP and the AD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) However, putting a brake on ANPP potential gains, </p><p>the party\'s organizational structure is cataleptic in some </p><p>areas and members fail to cooperate.  While the ANPP has </p><p>its eye on Kano state, a dispute over its candidate reduced </p><p>its appeal to the voters.  The gubernatorial candidate who </p><p>emerged is said to have few resources and little political </p><p>backing; the rancorous primary has left the ANPP sorely </p><p>factionalized.  Without a strong pull from Buhari\'s coat- </p><p>tails, that candidate is seen as having little chance of </p><p>success. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Presidential Rift </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) At the Presidential level, the relationship among </p><p>the ANPP candidate, Buhari, and his group of inexperienced </p><p>campaign staffers, mostly Northerners, with the party\'s new </p><p>National Chairman Don Etiebet, a native of Akwa Ibom state, </p><p>got off to a rocky start. This rift, combined with Buhari\'s </p><p>late launching of his campaign, coming after the murder of </p><p>key supporter Marshall Harry, meant that the ANPP had many </p><p>obstacles to overcome.  Buhari was nominated in a divisive </p><p>convention exercise, but made some efforts (not wholly </p><p>successful) to mollify his critics, even though he made </p><p>little effort to reconcile with the losers.  He enjoys </p><p>tremendous grassroots appeal in northern Nigeria, and some </p><p>positive sentiment in the south, a product of </p><p>disenchantment with Obasanjo\'s unproductive government that </p><p>has fueled a certain nostalgia for Buhari\'s firm governance </p><p>in the eighties. Buhari\'s selection of former Vice- </p><p>President Chuba Okadigbo, an Igbo, as his running mate has </p><p>helped draw some support from that critical region of the </p><p>country by giving the third largest ethnic group a second </p><p>shot at holding the Vice-presidency (Alex Ekwueme was Vice </p><p>President in the Second Republic). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Buhari\'s campaign has not featured prominently in </p><p>the government-controlled press, although he is gaining </p><p>more media attention.  Most private media outlets are </p><p>Lagos-based, a city that is much more friendly to Obasanjo </p><p>than Buhari.  The President\'s team has been very effective </p><p>at paying the press to ignore Buhari\'s campaign and </p><p>Buhari\'s team has been unable to convince the press to </p><p>provide coverage, largely due to the inexperience and lack </p><p>of deep pockets of his press staff. </p><p>7. (C) Yet, according to many, Buhari\'s public appearances </p><p>in some areas produce crowds exceeding even the </p><p>expectations of his optimistic campaign staff.  In Adamawa </p><p>state, many say that the turn-out dwarfed the crowd that </p><p>came to see the incumbent Vice-President, a native of the </p><p>state.  Throughout the north, the turnout for Buhari has </p><p>been enormous and spontaneous.  Similar crowds have </p><p>followed him throughout his northern campaign, including </p><p>Taraba, Plateau, Kano and Bauchi.  One Obasanjo campaigner, </p><p>traveling with the Vice-President lamented to PolOff that </p><p>Buhari attracts huge crowds, while the Obasanjo-Atiku </p><p>campaign is compelled to offer inducements to local </p><p>officials to round up crowds for the President or Vice- </p><p>President. Another Obasanjo campaign staffer told Poloff </p><p>that the crowds President Obasanjo drew in Port Harcourt, </p><p>Yola and Maiduguri were "no comparison" to the Buhari </p><p>appeal in the same locations.  He has even made some </p><p>headway in dispelling the accusation that he is a religious </p><p>bigot.  A group of bishops in the southeast recently </p><p>proclaimed that Buhari is an honest candidate and worthy of </p><p>support.  This week, Obasanjo\'s 1999 opponent Olu Falae and </p><p>the family of MKO Abiola reportedly endorsed Buhari\'s </p><p>candidacy.  Because of his image, Buhari is a compelling </p><p>figure whom people will come out to see -- the challenge is </p><p>whether that will translate into votes outside of the </p><p>northern region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Buhari\'s campaign also suffers from a lack of funds, </p><p>especially in comparison to the presumed open government </p><p>coffers available to the PDP.  He is receiving support from </p><p>the north and the south-south, but the northern elite have </p><p>been chary with their contributions.  Buhari is not popular </p><p>with two of the most important northern Emirs or with many </p><p>of the richest northern businessmen who worry that his </p><p>strict attention to discipline could dry up the government </p><p>trough and cripple their businesses.  Other traditional </p><p>rulers, including the Shehu of Borno and most of the other </p><p>Emirs in state capitals, are backing Buhari, but they lack </p><p>the deep pockets necessary to bankroll the campaign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  With the deepest pockets in the north, the </p><p>intentions of former Head of State Ibrahim Babangida demand </p><p>much attention.  His almost mythical reputation was </p><p>damaged, however, during the PDP and ANPP primaries. </p><p>Playing several levels of intrigue, he is widely viewed as </p><p>having failed to secure his preferred outcomes, and </p><p>possible opponents do not fear him as much as before. </p><p>According to one source, when he attempted to intervene in </p><p>a Senatorial race in his home state of Niger, he was told </p><p>(by a former lieutenant) that he should desist.  "Pick your </p><p>governor, and leave the rest to us," the lieutenant </p><p>reportedly advised his mentor.  Also, it appears that the </p><p>Abacha family, long believed to be funding Buhari, </p><p>apparently pulled back on their support. They have focussed </p><p>on channeling the bulk of their contributions to particular </p><p>gubernatorial and Assembly candidates in the North rather </p><p>than supporting Buhari. Figuring that Obasanjo will be </p><p>reelected, they probably do not want to unduly antagonize </p><p>him.  Also, given Buhari\'s track record, they cannot be </p><p>sure that he would not go after their ill-gotten gains if </p><p>elected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  COMMENT:  While it is difficult to assess overall </p><p>sentiment, the ANPP appears to have support throughout the </p><p>country, with the exception of the Yoruba southwest.  Given </p><p>the widespread disaffection with the Obasanjo government </p><p>and the harmful internecine rivalries in the PDP, the ANPP </p><p>might pick up some National Assembly and gubernatorial </p><p>seats at PDP expense.  Buhari seems to be gaining traction </p><p>in some places while Obasanjo, grappling with the fuel </p><p>shortages and the crisis in the Delta, is not going into </p><p>the elections at the full stride he had hoped.  Still, </p><p>Obasanjo has the advantages of incumbency and no one can </p><p>really tell if Buhari has successfully shaken the tag of </p><p>being a regional and a religious candidate. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
