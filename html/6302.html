<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001030 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IT, LY, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: LIBYA/UNSC: ITALY CONTINUES TO INTERVENE WITH </p><p>LIBYA; VAGUE ANSWERS FROM LIBYA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 495 </p><p>B. ROME 277 </p><p>C. 02 SECSTATE 241030 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 6. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: DESPITE VAGUE LIBYAN ANSWERS TO ROME\'S </p><p>REQUESTS THAT TRIPOLI FORGO OR AT LEAST POSTPONE ITS </p><p>CANDIDACY FOR THE UNSC, SENIOR MFA OFFICIALS SEEM CONVINCED </p><p>THAT LIBYA REMAINS SET ON PURSUING ITS UNSC CANDIDACY.  POL </p><p>MC URGED THE MFA TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO DISCOURAGE LIBYA </p><p>FROM PURSUING ITS CANDIDACY.  POL MC ALSO URGED THE MFA TO </p><p>USE ANY INFLUENCE IT MAY HAVE ON AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO PREVENT </p><p>THE LIBYANS FROM PURSUING THEIR UNSC CANDIDACY.  HE </p><p>INFORMALLY RAISED THE IDEA OF WHETHER A FRANCO-ITALIAN EFFORT </p><p>ON THIS ISSUE COULD BEAR FRUIT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON MARCH 10, POL MC AND NEA WATCHER MET MINISTER </p><p>EUGENIO D\'AURIA AND ANTONIO BELLAVIA, ASSISTANT TO THE MFA </p><p>DG\'S FOR NEA AND LIBYA OFFICE DIRECTOR, RESPECTIVELY.  WHEN </p><p>ASKED ABOUT ITALY\'S MOST RECENT EFFORTS TO DISSUADE LIBYA </p><p>FROM PURSUING A UNSC SEAT, D\'AURIA SAID THAT AMBASSADOR </p><p>ANTONIO BADINI, THE MFA\'S DG FOR NEA, RAISED U.S. CONCERNS </p><p>WITH THE LIBYAN DEPUTY FM WHILE ON AN OFFICIAL TRIP TO </p><p>TRIPOLI FEB. 20.  LIBYA\'S RESPONSE ON ITS UNSC CANDIDACY WAS </p><p>VAGUE, SAID D\'AURIA, JUST LIKE THE LIBYAN FM\'S RESPONSE WAS </p><p>VAGUE WHEN FM FRATTINI DISCUSSED THE SAME MATTER WITH HIM IN </p><p>ROME FEB. 5 (REF A.)  THIS SAID, D\'AURIA PREDICTED THAT LIBYA </p><p>REMAINED SET ON PURSUING ITS UNSC CANDIDACY.  (NOTE: IN A </p><p>SEPARATE MEETING, BISOGNERO, THE MFA\'S DEPUTY POLITICAL </p><p>DIRECTOR, SHARED THE SAME IMPRESSION WITH POL MC.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) LIBYA, PREDICTED D\'AURIA, WOULD FOLLOW THE SAME </p><p>APPROACH IN OBTAINING A UNSC NOMINATION AS IT DID IN SECURING </p><p>A NOMINATION FOR THE UNCHR: GET THE FULL SUPPORT OF AF </p><p>COUNTRIES FIRST, AND THEN SEEK WIDER SUPPORT.  POL MC URGED </p><p>THE GOI TO USE ANY INFLUENCE IT MAY HAVE WITH AF COUNTRIES TO </p><p>DISSUADE LIBYA FROM PURSUING A UNSC CANDIDACY.  D\'AURIA </p><p>REPLIED THAT ITALY HAS STRONG RELATIONS WITH MANY AF </p><p>COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY ETHIOPIA, ERITREA, AND ANGOLA, AND WILL </p><p>CONSIDER THE EFFECT APPROACHING THESE COUNTRIES MAY HAVE ON </p><p>THE OUTCOME. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) POL MC INFORMALLY RAISED THE IDEA OF WHETHER AN </p><p>ITALIAN COLLABORATION WITH FRANCE, WHICH HAS STRONG RELATIONS </p><p>WITH LIBYA AND SEVERAL AFRICAN COUNTRIES, COULD PROVE </p><p>FRUITFUL IN PREVENTING LIBYA FROM PURSUING A UNSC CANDIDACY. </p><p>D\'AURIA SAID HE WOULD "DISCREETLY" DISCUSS SUCH A POSSIBILITY </p><p>WITH HIS FRENCH COUNTERPART IN THEIR NEXT MEETING IN </p><p>BRUSSELS. </p><p>6. (C) EMBASSY SEEKS DEPARTMENT\'S GUIDANCE ON RESPONDING TO </p><p>ITALIAN OFFICIALS WHO ARE NOW INQUIRING IF THE REPORTED </p><p>SUCCESS OF THE MARCH 11 TRILATERAL MEETING WILL CHANGE ANY </p><p>THE USG POSITION ON LIBYA\'S UNSC CANDIDACY. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p></p><p>2003ROME01030 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
