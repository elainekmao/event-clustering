<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002542 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: MASS, PREF, SOCI, KHDP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  AUGUST VISIT TO IKEJA UXO </p><p>OPERATIONS </p><p> </p><p>1. On August 2, Ambassador Jeter, Consul General </p><p>Hinson-Jones, A/PAO, and ConOff visited the Ikeja </p><p>Military Cantonment in Lagos to observe the work </p><p>done by RONCO Consulting Corporation in removing </p><p>unexploded ordnance (UXO) still remaining after the </p><p>Jan. 27 explosion there.  The Embassy team met with </p><p>military authorities to discuss GON support for </p><p>RONCO during their final weeks of operation and </p><p>transfer of responsibility for continuing UXO </p><p>operations to GON agencies.  The tour concluded </p><p>with a press conference regarding the U.S.- </p><p>sponsored clean up effort and the continuing </p><p>hazards to civilians posed by UXO in the area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The Ambassador had expected to be accompanied </p><p>by the GON Minister of State for the Army Lawal </p><p>Batagarawa;  however, an urgent meeting delayed </p><p>the Minister\'s arrival.  Batagarawa did tour the </p><p>Cantonment and addressed the press some hours </p><p>after the Ambassador\'s return to Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Ambassador Jeter and his team toured the areas </p><p>cleared by RONCO and met their demining teams.  To </p><p>their obvious delight, the Ambassador spoke in </p><p>Portuguese to the Mozambican members of the RONCO </p><p>team and thanked them for the superb work they had </p><p>done in support of Nigeria and the United States. </p><p>As of August 1, RONCO had removed approximately </p><p>137,000 pieces of ordnance from sectors designated </p><p>A-3 to A-6.  There are thousands, indeed tens of </p><p>thousands, of pieces of unexploded ordnance, of all </p><p>calibers, still to be destroyed.  A detailed review </p><p>of RONCO\'s activities will be provided after the </p><p>conclusion of their operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The Ambassador, Consul General, and RONCO </p><p>managers met with Gen. G. S. Emdin, commander </p><p>of the Cantonment, and his staff.  The </p><p>Ambassador\'s objectives were:  first, to </p><p>solicit GON assistance for RONCO during the </p><p>final phase of their work, which involves </p><p>transporting large quantities of ordnance </p><p>to a demolition site 65 km. away; second, </p><p>to ask that qualified GON forces coordinate </p><p>with RONCO and assume control of the clearance </p><p>operations without interruption; and third, to </p><p>obtain GON permission to allow journalists, </p><p>assembling for the press conference, to tour the </p><p>site. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The absence of Army Minister Batagarawa </p><p>precluded substantive decisions on the part of </p><p>the Nigerian Army.  Without Ministerial approval, </p><p>General Emdin said that he lacked the resources </p><p>or authority to provide additional assistance to </p><p>RONCO or assign other units to work in the area. </p><p>He also refused to modify existing GON press </p><p>policy excluding journalists from the munitions </p><p>depot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Gen. Emdin asked the U.S. to continue funding </p><p>UXO clearance in the Cantonment. He stated that </p><p>the primary obstacle to immediate deployment of </p><p>Nigerian Engineering Corps troops to the Cantonment </p><p>was the Nigerian Army\'s inability to fund these </p><p>operations.  He requested additional U.S. support </p><p>for that purpose.  Gen. Emdin mentioned they had </p><p>asked RONCO to give the Nigerian Army all the </p><p>equipment RONCO had brought into Nigeria.  RONCO </p><p>forwarded this request to their Washington </p><p>headquarters for consideration.  Emdin then </p><p>produced a RONCO-supplied list of equipment needed </p><p>to support the work of three ten-men EOD teams; </p><p>then, he asked if the U.S. could supply the </p><p>equipment these teams would need to continue </p><p>the clearance efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The Ambassador responded that funds for the </p><p>Ikeja UXO operations had been reallocated from </p><p>other projects on an emergency basis, and it was </p><p>unlikely that additional resources could be found. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  During this meeting, the Nigerian Army informed </p><p>the Embassy team that clearing unexploded ordnance </p><p>from the ATD remained a high priority for them. </p><p>The Embassy, EUCOM, the British Army UXO advisors, </p><p>and RONCO have advised against the attempt. </p><p>(COMMENT:  This presents the prospect that should </p><p>USG allocate more resources to GON for UXO </p><p>disposal, it could well be utilized for a project </p><p>we have consistently advised against.  That said, </p><p>according to the RONCO team, the ATD is not </p><p>impossible to clear, in fact, RONCO claims that it </p><p>would not be much more difficult than some of the </p><p>areas already completed.  The problem is simply </p><p>that demining the ATD will take considerably more </p><p>time and effort than has been budgeted by anyone. </p><p>The effort would be slow and exceedingly meticulous, </p><p>but it could be done.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Ambassador spoke briefly with the Nigerian </p><p>press.  He provided a synopsis of Project Avid </p><p>Recovery and RONCO\'s activities and warned that </p><p>the area surrounding the ATD remained hazardous </p><p>and civilians should not enter the restricted area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  At the press conference following his </p><p>delayed arrival, Minister Batagarawa announced </p><p>that the continuing threat represented by </p><p>unexploded ordnance, had compelled the Nigerian </p><p>Army to transfer its troops to other posts and </p><p>not immediately repair the damaged buildings </p><p>within the Ikeja Military Cantonment.  In a </p><p>later discussion with the Ambassador, Batagarawa </p><p>said that the GON does not plan to abandon the </p><p>Cantonment but must first check the structural </p><p>integrity of the buildings before any repair </p><p>work can be started.  After this is done, Batagarawa </p><p>gave the impression that the Ikeja Cantonment </p><p>would be reoccupied. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
