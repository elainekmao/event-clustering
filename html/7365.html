During these contacts Turkey\'s concerns </p><p>regarding the region and particularly with the </p><p>above-mentioned cities (sic) were emphasized again, and the </p><p>U.S. was asked to fulfill the assurances that it had given to </p><p>us;" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- "The U.S. side told us, as they had assured with us </p><p>earlier, that our concerns were taken into consideration and </p><p>that they will not allow any faits accompli to occur, (and) </p><p>that U.S. forces are being transported to the region rapidly </p><p>and that they will control the situation;" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- "The U.S. side also proposed (the establishment of) </p><p>liaison teams of Turkish Armed Forces to join the U.S. forces </p><p>to be deployed in the region and to observe the situation on </p><p>the spot." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The announcement also noted that Turkey has accepted the </p><p>offer and that liaison teams will reach their areas of </p><p>deployment around 16:00 hrs (Ankara) April 11.  It also </p><p>stated that developments will be followed in light of the </p><p>information provided by these teams. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Moreover, "as a result of our initiatives, the local armed </p><p>forces which had entered Kirkuk have begun to withdraw.  The </p><p>same demand was conveyed to the U.S. regarding Mosul.  Our </p><p>intensive contacts with U.S. officials continue." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkey\'s humanitarian assistance to Iraq was also on the </p><p>meeting agenda: "Our efforts, which will be important for the </p><p>Iraqi people, are continuing in coordination with UN </p><p>organizations as well as bilaterally.  Within this framework, </p><p>more than 500 truckloads of medicine and food have crossed </p><p>the Turkish border into northern Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The announcement stated that the security situation in the </p><p>region was also discussed.  Preparedness levels and </p><p>fortification plans for Turkish Armed Forces units along the </p><p>border, "in adjacent regions" in southeastern Turkey and in </p><p>northern Iraq were reviewed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.

We reminded them of their </p><p>guarantees.  They said that those assurances are still </p><p>valid."  In response to a question, Gul stressed  that "the </p><p>important thing for Turkey is not to allow any faits </p><p>accompli."  Gul also announced that he postponed his trip to </p><p>Damascus and ruled out speculation that the U.S. made a </p><p>recommendation in that regard. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
