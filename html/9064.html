In this prestigious post, </p><p>Pearson will be responsible for the assignments of thousands </p><p>of American diplomats. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Edelman `warming up\' for Ankara: The new U.S. </p><p>Ambassador to Turkey, Eric Edelman, attended a series of </p><p>briefings and meetings on Turkey at the Carnegie Endowment </p><p>and the Brookings Institute last week, "Zaman" reports from </p><p>Washington.  The paper defines Edelman as a `smart, amiable, </p><p>and humble person with powerful connections.\'  Zaman expects </p><p>Edelman to have a tough time in dealing with priority issues </p><p>for the U.S. government such as cooperation with Turkey in </p><p>the Middle East, Armenia, and the continuation of economic </p><p>and political reforms. </p><p>Iran, Turkey cooperate against KADEK: Iran has launched a </p><p>military operation against KADEK militants who purportedly </p><p>infiltrated Iran from Northern Iraq.  The militants killed </p><p>eight Iranian soldiers in a raid against a police station </p><p>late last week.  Turkish troops are supporting the Iranian </p><p>assault against KADEK, and KADEK officials have accused </p><p>Turkey and Iran of setting up an alliance against the Kurds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Washington Post on Iraqi peacekeeping: Dailies cite a </p><p>Washington Post article claiming that the U.S. has asked for </p><p>`reinforcements\' from Turkey, Pakistan, and India to help </p><p>break the resistance of Iraqi militant groups affiliated </p><p>with Saddam Hussein.  The Post expects delay in the arrival </p><p>of reinforcements due to `political and logistical </p><p>obstacles.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ankara might open its border with Armenia: Papers report </p><p>that a Turkish parliamentary delegation in Washington last </p><p>week called on Ankara and Yerevan to take steps toward </p><p>normalization of relations.  The Turkish parliamentarians </p><p>said that the opening of the Turkish-Armenian border and </p><p>bilateral trade would help in warming ties with Armenia. </p><p>After meeting with the Assembly of Armenian Americans (AAA) </p><p>in Washington, Turkish MPs said they also favored opening </p><p>the ruins of the ancient city of Ani, near Turkey\'s eastern </p><p>border, to Armenian tourists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Larson on Turkey\'s economy: Speaking at the Brookings </p><p>Institution last week, Assistant Secretary of State Alan </p><p>Larson said that despite significant progress seen in </p><p>Turkey\'s economy after the 2001 crisis, there are still </p><p>vital weak points in Turkey\'s economic management.  Larson </p><p>drew attention to Turkey\'s dangerously high public debt, </p><p>which amounts to around 82 percent of the national income. </p><p>Turkey\'s economy needs `aggressive\' structural reforms, </p><p>Larson said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S., Greece attempt to `by-pass\' Denktas: "Aksam" claimed </p><p>on Monday that Greek Prime Minister Simitis has asked U.S. </p><p>help in by-passing Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas.  The EU </p><p>and the U.S. reportedly agreed at their recent summit to </p><p>unite the Turkish Cypriot opposition against Denktas in </p><p>upcoming elections this December.  The Turkish Cypriot </p><p>opposition had earlier vowed to sack Denktas as negotiator </p><p>in the peace talks if it comes to power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkish soldiers in Iraq?" </p><p>Ferai Tinc noted in mass appeal Hurriyet (6/30): "The US </p><p>miscalculated the aftermath of the war, and it seems things </p><p>are becoming messier in Iraq.  The number of Iraqis opposing </p><p>the occupation is growing every day.  There is even </p><p>discontent among the Kurds, supposedly America\'s best ally </p><p>in Iraq.  According to the reports, the Pentagon has now </p><p>started thinking about Turkey, and a Washington Post story </p><p>tells us that the U.S. has requested Turkish troops. . If </p><p>the story is true, Turkey should think about sending its </p><p>troops to help for the establishment of a democratic Iraqi </p><p>state and a stable and secure Iraq.  But if the US is </p><p>seeking Turkish troops for helping to reinforce the current </p><p>occupation, we should not be part of it.  There is only one </p><p>way for the US to get rid of the `occupation force\' label: </p><p>by activating the UN to take on a more active role." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US and Turkey" </p><p>Murat Yetkin wrote from Washington in liberal-intellectual </p><p>Radikal (6/29): "After having a series of talks with </p><p>Washington officials, my observation is that US prestige has </p><p>been shaken, especially in Europe, by Turkey\'s failure to </p><p>pass the motion that would have allowed American troops to </p><p>move through Turkey.  One still can feel sense the traces of </p><p>disappointment with Turkey in Washington.  However, it is </p><p>the US, not Turkey, that  benefited from the decline of the </p><p>motion, in both political and military terms.  The US saved </p><p>billions of dollars, prevented the entry of Turkish troops </p><p>into Northern Iraq, and brought Turkey to a policy more in </p><p>line with what Washington had wanted." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
