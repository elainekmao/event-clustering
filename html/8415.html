<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003207 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON SHARM EL-SHEIKH AND AQABA </p><p>SUMMITS </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead story in all papers today, June 2, is that the </p><p>King and Queen yesterday met with Professor Klaus </p><p>Schwab, Head and Founder of the World Economic Forum. </p><p>The King noted that holding this conference in Jordan </p><p>is a distinguished initative towards formulating a </p><p>joint vision for the future. Another lead story </p><p>focuses on Prime Minister Abul Ragheb\'s meeting with </p><p>Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas "Abu Mazen," </p><p>in Amman yesterday. Discussion focused on the </p><p>importance of implementing the road map and Jordan\'s </p><p>support for Abu Mazen\'s government. Abu Mazen is </p><p>expected to meet with King Abdullah today. Papers also </p><p>reported that Foreign Minister Dr. Marwan Muasher will </p><p>leave for Sharm El-Sheikh today to take part in </p><p>preparations for the summit that will take place there </p><p>tomorrow. The paper reported that Muasher denied </p><p>statements by Jordan\'s ambassador to the U.S. doubting </p><p>Abu Mazan\'s support among Palestinians. According to </p><p>press reports, the Foreign Minister noted that the </p><p>Ambassador was talking about a media and political </p><p>campaign which could help the road map succeed. All </p><p>papers reported that the State Security Court will </p><p>look into the case of murdered U.S. diplomat Laurence </p><p>Foley on Wednesday. Commentaries mainly focused on the </p><p>forthcoming summits in Sharm El-Sheikh and Aqaba and </p><p>the elections. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Will A Breakthrough Start from Aqaba?" </p><p> </p><p>After making a point that the forthcoming Aqaba summit </p><p>crowns Jordan\'s peace efforts and is an </p><p>acknowledgement of what Jordan has contributed, daily </p><p>columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>semi-official influential Arabic daily Al-Rai (06/02): </p><p>"President Bush has a difficult task ahead of him. </p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Sharon is the one who will </p><p>render Aqaba a success or a failure because the </p><p>Palestinians and Arabs are more aware of their need to </p><p>review their stands after what happened in Iraq. The </p><p>bet is not on Sharon\'s inherent stands but on Bush\'s </p><p>willingness and ability to exercise pressure on Sharon </p><p>and on how sincere he was when he told some Arab </p><p>journalists in an interview with him: `Yes, I can </p><p>exert pressure on Sharon.\' Can he really do so? We </p><p>shall wait and see .. The waters of Aqaba will prove </p><p>the diver to be a liar if he cannot swim!!" </p><p> </p><p> -- "Mr. Powell\'s Return" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Osama Sharif writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/02): "It is difficult to predict the importance of </p><p>holding a summit in Sharm El-Sheikh and another one in </p><p>Aqaba this week in terms of their practical results </p><p>and how they will affect on the peace process and on </p><p>the future of U.S.-Arab relations after the Iraq </p><p>earthquake. On the one hand, both summits could be </p><p>just another one of those Public Relations campaigns </p><p>aimed at softening the effects of Arab resentment </p><p>resulting from the U.S. war on Iraq and its occupation </p><p>of it for an indefinate time. Therefore, perhaps what </p><p>was required was to beautify the U.S. image and to </p><p>divert attention from Washington\'s practices in Iraq </p><p>to Palestine within the so-called road map. On another </p><p>hand, the U.S. Administration may truly be determined </p><p>to activate the Palestinian-Israeli portfolio and to </p><p>force both parties to sit at the negotiations table to </p><p>reach a final solution." </p><p> </p><p>Sharif continues: "Powell bowed to the storm when </p><p>Cheney and Rumsfeld caught the president\'s interest </p><p>during the Iraq crisis and the war. However, he was </p><p>not totally defeated. Here he is back on the scene </p><p>alongside his president, who is launching a diplomatic </p><p>campaign in Europe and the Middle East at a time when </p><p>the hawks are demanding that he be stern and continue </p><p>with the thick stick diplomacy . However, Powell\'s </p><p>return to the scene may give some hope regarding the </p><p>U.S. Administration\'s stand on the Palestnian issue </p><p>and its future." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
