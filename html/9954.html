With the approval of the package, the </p><p>military\'s influence over Turkey\'s politics will be limited. </p><p>"Zaman" reports that the approval takes Turkey closer to the </p><p>EU.  "Milliyet" notes that the military had expected Sezer </p><p>to veto the package, and that the president signed the </p><p>package despite the open opposition of the NSC Secretary </p><p>General.  "Vatan" argues that the approval of the seventh </p><p>package has transformed the NSC into an advisory body.  The </p><p>NSC will convene every two months instead of once per month, </p><p>and the council will only have the authority to make </p><p>recommendations on national security issues.  With this </p><p>package, freedom of thought is expanded and penalties for </p><p>insulting the state and state officials are reduced.  The </p><p>package also supports judicial action against torture, and </p><p>stipulates that civilians can no longer be tried in military </p><p>courts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Response to the Repentance Law:  "Hurriyet" reports that 2 </p><p>PKK/KADEK militants surrendered in Iraq, and 80 other </p><p>members of terrorist organizations applied  to Turkish </p><p>security forces in Turkey to benefit from the repentance law </p><p>on the first day of its application.   Special centers have </p><p>been established in Van, Sirnak and Kirklareli for the </p><p>surrendering militants.  Interior Minister Aksu said that </p><p>around 5,000 PKK/KADEK militants in Northern Iraq are </p><p>expected to apply to benefit from the amnesty.  Meanwhile, </p><p>"Hurriyet" reports that yesterday PKK militants attacked a </p><p>police station in Mardin, killing two policeman.  Turkish </p><p>officials claim that anti-amnesty militants were responsible </p><p>for this attack.  In an interview with El-Cezire TV, KDP </p><p>leader Barzani urged all PKK militants in northern Iraq to </p><p>return to Turkey. </p><p>Cancellation of PETKIM Bid:  All papers report that the </p><p>Privatization Administration has cancelled the sale of state- </p><p>owned PETKIM to the Uzan group.  After court decisions </p><p>against the Uzan family in Switzerland and the United States </p><p>opened the way for a freeze of the family\'s assets abroad, </p><p>the Uzans were unable to pay the agreed $605 million for </p><p>PETKIM.  A new tender will now be required for the company\'s </p><p>privatization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> "Strengthening Baghdad" </p><p>Erdal Safak opined in the mass appeal Sabah (8/7): "Turkey </p><p>once again has a chance to prevent undesirable developments </p><p>from taking place in Iraq. . There are some facts that </p><p>Turkey should take into consideration immediately.  Current </p><p>indications coming from Iraq do not give hope for the </p><p>maintenance of Iraq\'s territorial integrity.  There are many </p><p>activists in northern Iraq who advocate an independent </p><p>Kurdish state, and efforts are underway to move toward a </p><p>referendum on the issue.  For instance, the `Kurdistan </p><p>Journalists Federation\' decided not to join the Iraqi </p><p>Journalists Union, based on the that it is `independent.\' . </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul has rightly underlined the importance </p><p>of `strengthening Baghdad.\'  There is only one way toward </p><p>the strengthening of Baghdad, which is the presence of </p><p>Turkish troops there.  Turkey already missed its first </p><p>chance, and now it has been given a second.  It is very </p><p>unlikely that there will be a third chance." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Risk Analysis" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in the Islamist-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(8/7): "Iraq has turned into a quagmire, and Turkey should </p><p>stay away from it.  Yet there is no harm for Turkey in </p><p>helping and advising others on how to `dry the quagmire.\'  . </p><p>Turkey\'s presence in Iraq should only be considered after </p><p>the withdrawal of foreign troops and the handing of control </p><p>to the United Nations.  . The US so far has not shown any </p><p>sign of change in its current policies in Iraq.  Bremer, </p><p>whose position is that of a typical `occupation Governor\' is </p><p>not optimistic about cooperation with indigenous Iraqi </p><p>groups.  Washington is not very optimistic about Bremer\'s </p><p>success either.  . Turkey should not contribute to the </p><p>ongoing occupation by sending its troops there.  Instead, </p><p>Turkey\'s mission should be designed to persuade the US and </p><p>the UK to correct their mistakes.  Both the US and UK should </p><p>leave Iraq to the Iraqis, and leave the region to regional </p><p>countries.  It is in their best interests to withdraw from </p><p>Iraq as soon as possible." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
