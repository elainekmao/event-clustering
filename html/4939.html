<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Political Parties, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI KING\'S PUBLIC ADDRESS WELL ATTENDED; </p><p>POLITICIANS MIFFED </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 KATHMANDU 2295 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  On January 3 King Gyanendra assured </p><p>thousands of attendees at a much-heralded "civic reception" </p><p>in the southeastern border city of Biratnagar that he will </p><p>uphold multi-party democracy and urged all groups to work </p><p>together toward national unity.  Biratnagar residents defied </p><p>a Maoist general strike, or "bandh," specifically called to </p><p>disrupt the royal reception.  Leaders of the two largest </p><p>political parties criticized the  reception as inappropriate </p><p>for a constitutional monarch.  The apparent success of this </p><p>event may encourage the king to engage in more frequent </p><p>public appearances and more direct outreach to the Nepali </p><p>people.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On January 3 King Gyanendra made his first, </p><p>much-heralded public speech before a crowd of 25,000 in the </p><p>southeastern border city of Biratnagar, according to local </p><p>press reports.  The event, billed as "a civic reception," </p><p>marks the first live public address by the monarch since his </p><p>accession to the throne in June 2001.  By scheduling his </p><p>first address in Biratnagar, Gyanendra is perpetuating a </p><p>tradition begun by his grandfather that a new king holds his </p><p>first public speaking appearance in that city. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Security was tight throughout the city.  A Maoist </p><p>general strike, or "bandh," called specifically to disrupt </p><p>the event, went unheeded by local residents, who turned out </p><p>in force to greet the monarch.  Approximately 30,000 soldiers </p><p>and police were deployed throughout the city, and the local </p><p>press reported that 900 "suspicious" persons had been </p><p>arrested in the city and its environs in the days leading up </p><p>to the reception. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Despite popular expectations that the king was saving </p><p>a major announcement--perhaps news of a political </p><p>rapprochement with political parties and/or impending </p><p>dialogue with Maoist insurgents--for his debut, his </p><p>ten-minute address contained no surprises.  He reaffirmed the </p><p>importance of multiparty democracy, which he cited as a </p><p>catalyst for the political, economic and social development </p><p>of the nation.  By adhering to the principles of multiparty </p><p>democracy and constitutional monarchy and working together, </p><p>the people can build "a capable and prosperous new Nepal.". </p><p>Repeated references to the importance of cooperation and the </p><p>need to transcend petty partisan interests for the good of </p><p>the nation were most likely backhanded swipes at political </p><p>leaders who continue to criticize his October 11 appointment </p><p>of an interim government.  While making no specific </p><p>references to the Maoists or the violent insurgency that has </p><p>crippled Nepal for almost seven years, he called for "all </p><p>misunderstandings" to be solved through dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Preparations for the reception were harshly </p><p>criticized by leaders of the two largest political parties, </p><p>with the outcry from Nepali Congress Party President G.P. </p><p>Koirala (whose constituency is just outside Biratnagar) the </p><p>loudest.  Addressing the party faithful at a rally January 2, </p><p>Koirala claimed the king was transgressing his role as </p><p>constitutional monarch by participating in the program.  He </p><p>also complained that millions of rupees of taxpayers\' money </p><p>was being spent on the reception. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Comment:  Now that the one-year moratorium on </p><p>public appearances and travel imposed after his brother\'s </p><p>death has expired, King Gyanendra may gradually be more in </p><p>the public eye.  Nepali monarchs traditionally have held </p><p>occasional public receptions.   Koirala\'s claims that the </p><p>current king is somehow violating the Constitution by </p><p>following  this tradition is therefore specious.  The real, </p><p>implicit concern is that the King\'s efforts at popular </p><p>outreach might prove more successful than the partisan </p><p>rallies being held by Koirala himself and his Communist Party </p><p>of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML) counterpart in </p><p>locations around the country (Reftel).  It will be </p><p>interesting to see if the King follows up the apparent </p><p>success of his debut with more such appearances in other </p><p>parts of the country. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
