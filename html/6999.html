<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000550 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA PLAY - IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1. Sri Lanka\'s English-medium front pages found room for </p><p>only two war-related headlines on 4/1:  "U.S. pounds </p><p>Baghdad, battles to the south," said one; "U.S. in first </p><p>major clash with Republican guard" said the other.  More -- </p><p>and more strident -- headlines appeared on the vernacular </p><p>front pages, however.  "Iraq Information Ministry heavily </p><p>damaged by missile attack, "Missile attacks Saddam\'s son\'s </p><p>palace," and "America faces the Iraqi super force for the </p><p>first time" said the Sinhala dailies, while the Tamil </p><p>dailies led with headlines such as "Stiff resistance from </p><p>Iraqi forces," "Four thousand suicide bombers ready to face </p><p>coalition forces," and "U.S. Commanders say \'No hurry in </p><p>capturing Baghdad.\'" </p><p> </p><p>2. Under the headline "Double standards on peace, the </p><p>editors of the DAILY NEWS (government-owned English daily, </p><p>islandwide circulation) wondered why some Sri Lankans are </p><p>simultaneously pro-peace in Iraq and "deafeningly silent" </p><p>regarding peace in Sri Lanka itself.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"... war involves killing and loss of life and this stark </p><p>fact has to be bemoaned regardless of where it occurs. </p><p> </p><p>"What leads us to these thoughts is the emergence of a </p><p>perplexing mindset among some sections of local opinion on </p><p>the question of peace in Sri Lanka.  While these sections </p><p>would, rightly, denounce the loss of life in the war in </p><p>Iraq, they tend to be deafeningly silent on the moral </p><p>correctness in ending the conflict in Sri Lanka by peaceful </p><p>means. </p><p> </p><p>"In other words, the very same sections are some of the </p><p>most vociferous critics of the current peace process.  A </p><p>clear instance of double standards -- to say the least. It </p><p>is this mental anomaly which led Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe to observe recently at a rally in Matara </p><p>that: \'Some sections among our people are against the war </p><p>in Iraq, but the same people are against the peace process </p><p>in Sri Lanka.\'" </p><p> </p><p>3. LANKADEEPA (independent Sinhala daily, islandwide </p><p>circulation) writes an editorial to ask "What\'s the </p><p>objective of war in Iraq war?"  LANKADEEPA\'s answer: </p><p>American imperialism.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"The U.S. has now launched a new imperialism.  It is now </p><p>the richest and most powerful nation on earth and won\'t let </p><p>any other nation come close.... </p><p> </p><p>"Whatever the U.S.\'s ulterior motive, the war is against a </p><p>very helpless population, which suffered enough during the </p><p>first Gulf War, which has gone homeless, suffered </p><p>embargos....  What will become of them?" </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
