<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000965 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A/OPR/ALS FOR THURMAN, WARD/WHITE </p><p>A/OPR/CR FOR ANNIE DICKSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ALOW, AMGT, APER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  BUSING IN ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>Refs: State 42908 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  In response to reftel, Post presents its cost-breakdown </p><p>for the school bus service offered by the American </p><p>Employees\' Association of Abuja (AEAA).  Section 273 states </p><p>that school transportation costs may be granted based on an </p><p>acceptable documentation of the actual costs.  Reftel also </p><p>states that the "primary criterion to determine if a fee or </p><p>charge is allowable or not is to ask whether the service is </p><p>normally provided free of charge in the Unites States </p><p>public school system." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Any reasonable fee charged by a private entity (school </p><p>bus company) to a public entity (school district) reflects </p><p>overhead costs, either explicitly or implicitly.  Post </p><p>confirms that AEAA\'s overhead costs are legitimate.  The </p><p>Department enters into contracts frequently that include </p><p>specific provisions for payment of overhead.  Since </p><p>submitting its last cost breakdown, AEAA\'s position has </p><p>changed materially in that the Embassy has agreed to </p><p>provide a small office at a nominal fee.  Accordingly, the </p><p>cost associated with office expenses has been deleted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  The greatest round-trip mileage on the route is eight </p><p>miles.  Please find below an updated annualized cost </p><p>breakdown for Abuja\'s bus service which reflects these </p><p>changes: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Vehicle Costs    4,800 </p><p>Base Radio     400 </p><p>Insurance     4,200 </p><p>Fuel      2,000 </p><p>Maintenance    2,000 </p><p>FSN Driver:    3,500 </p><p>U.S. Manager:    2,000 </p><p>Service Charge:   1,900 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Total annual costs:   $20,800 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Association has been providing transportation </p><p>services to nine eligible dependents of direct-hire </p><p>Americans since January, 2001. This works out to a $2200 </p><p>annual charge for bus transportation.  Invoices totaling </p><p>$1,100 per child have been delivered to parents of school </p><p>children using the bus for the Spring semester, 2001. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
