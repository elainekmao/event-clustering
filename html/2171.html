VIETNAMESE INDIVIDUALS </p><p>ARE FREE TO WORSHIP AND PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION OPENLY IN </p><p>LAM DONG PROVINCE, ACCORDING TO ALL THREE GROUPS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONTROLS REMAIN ON RELIGIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  MANY BUDDHISTS IN LAM DONG APPEAR TO BE </p><p>AVOIDING POLITICS ALTOGETHER, AND MAKE A CLEAR DISTINCTION </p><p>BETWEEN RELIGION AND POLITICAL ACTIVITY.  CATHOLICS IN LAM </p><p>DONG APPEAR TO BELIEVE THE CHURCH HAS AN APPROPRIATE ROLE TO </p><p>PLAY IN INFLUENCING POLITICS, BUT THAT ROLE SHOULD BE </p><p>DISCREET AND NON-CONFRONTATIONAL.  PLEASE PROTECT ALL </p><p>SOURCES ON SENSITIVE COMMENTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>BUDDHIST NUNS FOCUS ON PRAYER NOT POLITICS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) THE "SU NU BUDDHIST CONVENT" IN DALAT IS THE PRIMARY </p><p>BUDDHIST CONVENT IN LAM DONG PROVINCE.  OF THE ROUGHLY 300 </p><p>BUDDHIST NUNS IN DALAT, 40 RESIDE AT SU NU CONVENT.  THE </p><p>CONVENT IS OPEN TO BUDDHIST WOMEN OF ALL AGES AND ETHNIC </p><p>BACKGROUNDS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>NUNS AT THE CONVENT AND ONLY A FEW IN DALAT AS A WHOLE. </p><p>(NOTE:  NUNS THERE INDICATED ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THE </p><p>PROVINCE, AS ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM, ARE OFTEN EITHER CATHOLIC </p><p>OR PROTESTANT).  UPON ENTRY INTO THE CONVENT, BUDDHIST NUNS </p><p>UNDERGO RIGOROUS TRAINING IN BUDDHIST TEACHINGS AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01272  01 OF 03  130924Z </p><p>SCRIPTURE.  TYPICALLY, A BUDDHIST NUN REACHES SENIOR RANKS </p><p>WITHIN THE CHURCH AFTER 8-10 YEARS OF STUDY AND TRAINING. </p><p>THE CONVENT PAYS ONLY A PORTION OF TOTAL TRAINING COSTS AND </p><p>RECEIVES NO GOVERNMENT FUNDING OR SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) WHEN ASKED BY CONOFFS ABOUT THE OFFICIAL DISTINCTION </p><p>BETWEEN THE UNIFIED BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM (UBCV) AND </p><p>THE VIETNAM BUDDHIST CHURCH (VBC), BUDDHIST NUNS AT THE </p><p>CONVENT SAID THAT, IN THEIR OPINION, VIETNAMESE BUDDHISTS </p><p>ARE ALL "BUDDHIST BROTHERS AND SISTERS" AND THAT THEY SEE NO </p><p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN FOLLOWERS OF THE UBCV AND THE VBC.  THEY </p><p>ADDED THAT THE GVN RECOGNIZES OFFICIALLY ONLY THE VBC, </p><p>NOTING THAT LEADERS OF THE UBCV DO NOT RECOGNIZE GVN CONTROL </p><p>OVER THE CHURCH\'S ACTIVITIES.  THE NUNS OFFERED NO </p><p>PARTICULAR OPINIONS ABOUT GVN POLICY TOWARDS THE UBCV BUT </p><p>SAID THAT SOME RELIGIOUS GROUPS, ESPECIALLY PROTESTANTS, </p><p>HAVE "PROBLEMS" WITH THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY BECOME "TOO </p><p>POLITICALLY INVOLVED."  THE NUNS SAID LOCAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>ROUTINELY REVIEW THEIR PUBLIC ACTIVITIES, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>REQUIRING PRIOR PERMISSION FOR MEETINGS OUTSIDE THE CONVENT. </p><p>HOWEVER, THEY SAID THERE HAVE NOT BEEN RESTRICTIONS ON THE </p><p>DAY-TO-DAY WORSHIP OF THEIR FAITH WITHIN THE CONVENT, WHICH </p><p>IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THEM THAN POLITICAL ACTIVISM. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS SERVE TO CONTROL CHURCH GROWTH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) CATHOLICS IN LAM DONG PROVINCE ARE FREE TO WORSHIP </p><p>AND PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION WITHOUT INTERFERENCE.  FATHER VO </p><p>DUC MINH, RECTOR OF DALAT CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL AND CHIEF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DALAT DIOCESE, TOLD CONOFFS THAT A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01272  01 OF 03  130924Z </p><p>TOTAL OF ABOUT 500 VIETNAMESE CATHOLICS ATTEND THE TWO </p><p>MASSES HELD AT THE CATHEDRAL DAILY, WHILE A TOTAL OF ABOUT </p><p>5000 ATTEND THE FIVE MASSES HELD EVERY SUNDAY. HE CLAIMED </p><p>THERE ARE ROUGHLY 250,000 CATHOLICS IN THE PROVINCE, ABOUT </p><p>25 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF ABOUT 1.2 MILLION.  HE </p><p>SAID MOST ETHNIC MINORITIES IN LAM DONG PROVINCE (OUT OF A </p><p>TOTAL MINORITY POPULATION ESTIMATED AT 125,000) ARE </p><p>CATHOLIC. </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) FATHER MINH SAID CATHOLIC CHILDREN, BOTH VIETNAMESE </p><p>AND ETHNIC MINORITY, CAN LEARN THE CATHOLIC FAITH AND ARE </p><p>FREE TO STUDY THE BIBLE.  HE EXPLAINED THERE IS VERY LITTLE, </p><p>IF ANY, GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN THE DAY-TO-DAY WORSHIP OR </p><p>RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES OF ORDINARY CATHOLIC CITIZENS.  HE ALSO </p><p>SAID THERE IS LITTLE DISCRIMINATION IN DAILY LIFE FOR </p><p>ORDINARY BELIEVERS, ALTHOUGH CATHOLICS DO NOT USUALLY REACH </p><p>THE VERY TOP LEVELS, WHICH ARE CONTROLLED BY THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY.  MINH SAID THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH AND THE GVN ARE ADMINISTRATIVE AND ORGANIZATIONAL IN </p><p>NATURE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN DALAT (AS </p><p>ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM) CONTROLS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF </p><p>SEMINARIANS AND THE NUMBER OF NEW PRIESTS THAT CAN BE </p><p>ORDAINED.  ALSO, THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON THE </p><p>MOVEMENT OF CLERGY, APPOINTMENT OF BISHOPS AND OTHER </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE CHURCH.  ACCORDING TO FATHER </p><p>MINH, THESE ARE SMALL "ANNOYANCES" BUT THEY ADD UP OVER TIME </p><p>LIKE "DROPS OF WATER" AND SERVE TO RESTRAIN THE CHURCH\'S </p><p>GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>LAM DONG CATHOLIC CHURCH "DISCREET" IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>LOCAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) LAM DONG PROVINCE AVOIDED THE ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>DISTURBANCES THAT TOOK PLACE EARLIER THIS YEAR IN DAKLAK AND </p><p>GIA LAI PROVINCES (REFTEL A), ALSO IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. </p><p>FATHER MINH SAID THIS WAS, IN PART, DUE TO THE MORE ACTIVE </p><p>EFFORTS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN LAM DONG TO ASSIST ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES.  HE SAID CATHOLIC CLERGY IN LAM DONG VISIT </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES REGULARLY BUT "DISCREETLY" TO </p><p>PREACH THEIR FAITH AND PERFORM CATHOLIC SERVICES.  HE ALSO </p><p>SAID THAT THE LAM DONG CATHOLIC CHURCH IS MORE COOPERATIVE </p><p>AND LESS "ANTAGONISTIC" IN ITS DEALINGS WITH LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES THAN THE CHURCH IN OTHER PROVINCES, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>STRESSED HE DID NOT WANT TO CRITICIZE THE ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>VIETNAMESE CHURCH LEADERS ELSEWHERE.  HE SAID THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH ADVOCATES REFORMS IN LAM DONG, BUT DOES SO IN A NON- </p><p>CONFRONTATIONAL MANNER, AND THERE HAS BEEN GRADUAL PROGRESS </p><p>WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES (SUCH AS </p><p>THE APPOINTMENT OF BISHOPS). </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) FATHER MINH CONTRASTED THIS A BIT WITH THE </p><p>PROTESTANT COMMUNITY, WHICH HE FINDS MORE CONFRONTATIONAL. </p><p>HE MENTIONED THAT MANY PROTESTANT PASTORS AND LAY PEOPLE </p><p>LEFT VIETNAM AFTER 1975, WHILE MOST CATHOLIC PRIESTS AND </p><p>CLERGY IN LAM DONG REMAINED TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. </p><p>THIS LEFT MANY PROTESTANT BELIEVERS "LIKE LOST SHEEP WITHOUT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01272  02 OF 03  130925Z </p><p>A SHEPHERD," HE CLAIMED, AND THEY HAVE OVER TIME TAKEN A </p><p>MORE ACTIVIST APPROACH TOWARDS DIFFERENCES WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  MINH, SPEAKING PERSONALLY, SAID HE FINDS THIS </p><p>STYLE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT IT IS </p><p>VERY HARD NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN VIEW </p><p>OF THE SERIOUS SUFFERING UNDERGONE BY MANY CATHOLICS AND </p><p>PROTESTANTS IN THE PERIOD AFTER 1975, NOTING THE SITUATION </p><p>HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE EARLY 1990\'S. </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) NOTE:  WHILE FATHER MINH AND, IN A SEPARATE </p><p>CONVERSATION, THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT BOTH TAKE CREDIT FOR </p><p>THE LACK OF ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTS IN LAM DONG EARLIER </p><p>THIS YEAR, THE COMPLEX SITUATION FACING ETHNIC MINORITIES IN </p><p>THE PROVINCE DEFIES SIMPLE POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS </p><p>EXPLANATIONS.  AS NOTED IN REF A, THE ISSUES SURROUNDING </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS\' UNREST INCLUDE A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS, </p><p>INTER ALIA, MIGRATION, LAND DISPUTES, DISCRIMINATION, </p><p>ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES, RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES, EDUCATION </p><p>ISSUES AND OUTSIDE INFLUENCES.  FATHER MINH EMPHASIZES THE </p><p>CHURCH\'S EFFORTS AT QUIET DIPLOMACY.  PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>STRESS THEIR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES.  BOTH ARE </p><p>PROBABLY PART OF THE PUZZLE, BUT EVEN TAKEN TOGETHER THEY DO </p><p>NOT SEEM ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN WHY LAM DONG HAS BEEN DIFFERENT </p><p>FROM OTHER CENTRAL HIGHLAND PROVINCES.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>WEALTHY ZEN MONASTERY WITH VISIBLE "VIET-KIEU" CONNECTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.(SBU) THE DALAT "TRUC LAM ZEN INSTITUTION" WAS ESTABLISHED </p><p>IN 1994 ABOUT 6 KM FROM DALAT CITY AND NOW REPRESENTS THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01272  02 OF 03  130925Z </p><p>LARGEST ZEN COMMUNITY IN VIETNAM (A MINORITY OF BUDDHISTS IN </p><p>VIETNAM PRACTICE ZEN ALTHOUGH CONOFFS COULD NOT OBTAIN </p><p>SPECIFIC FIGURES).  MASTER THICH THANH TU, CHIEF OF THE ZEN </p><p>INSTITUTE, HAS ESTABLISHED NINE OTHER ZEN MEDITATION CENTERS </p><p>THROUGHOUT VIETNAM.  ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ZEN BUDDHISTS, OF </p><p>WHICH EIGHTY ARE MEN, RESIDE AND PRACTICE AT THE INSTITUTE </p><p>NEAR DALAT.  THE INSTITUTE ALSO TEACHES FOLLOWERS AND </p><p>STUDENTS ZEN MEDITATION AND PHILOSOPHY.  VISITORS, INCLUDING </p><p>FOREIGNERS, ARE ALLOWED TO STUDY AT THE INSTITUTE, BUT THE </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROHIBITS FOREIGNERS FROM SPENDING THE </p><p>NIGHT ON INSTITUTE GROUNDS.  FOREIGNERS MUST RETURN TO DALAT </p><p>AFTER BUSINESS HOURS ALTHOUGH THEY CAN VISIT THE INSTITUTE </p><p>AS OFTEN AS THEY LIKE. </p><p> </p><p>10.(SBU) THE INSTITUTE RECEIVES NO GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND </p><p>ALL FUNDS ARE RAISED THROUGH PRIVATE DONATIONS BOTH </p><p>DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD.  THE NAMES OF PRIVATE DONORS THAT </p><p>CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE INSTITUTE ARE PAINTED ON </p><p>CONCRETE BENCHES, WHICH DOT THE INSTITUTE\'S MANICURED </p><p>GROUNDS.  CONOFFS NOTICED THAT MOST OF THESE BENCHES BEAR </p><p>THE NAMES OF AMERICAN "VIET-KIEU" (OVERSEAS VIETNAMESE) </p><p>DONORS.  CONOFFS WERE TOLD MASTER THICH THANH TU WAS </p><p>VISITING THE INSTITUTE\'S SAN DIEGO BRANCH (DAI DAC </p><p>MONASTERY).  ASKED ABOUT GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS, ONE OF THE </p><p>MONKS INDICATED ZEN BUDDHISTS ARE FREE TO WORSHIP THEIR </p><p>RELIGION AND ARE NOT RESTRICTED BY THE GOVERNMENT, UNLESS </p><p>THEY ARE "INVOLVED IN POLITICS."  HE IMPLIED SUCH ACTIVISM </p><p>WAS NOT THE ROLE OF THE BUDDHIST CHURCH IN LAM DONG. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.(SBU) IT IS DIFFICULT TO GENERALIZE FROM THE HANDFUL OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS LEADERS WE MET IN DALAT.  THE BUDDHISTS WE </p><p>CONTACTED IN LAM DONG APPEAR TO BE TAKING A HANDS-OFF </p><p>APPROACH TO POLITICS BY FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON PRACTICING </p><p>THEIR FAITH AND AVOIDING DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  FATHER MINH SEES A CLEAR ROLE FOR THE CHURCH IN </p><p>INFLUENCING GRADUAL REFORM THROUGH DISCREET AND NON- </p><p>CONFRONTATIONAL EFFORTS.  A COMMON THEME HERE -- WE HAVE </p><p>ALSO HEARD ELSEWHERE -- IS ONE OF RELATIVE FREEDOM FOR </p><p>RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL.  RESTRICTIONS </p><p>OCCUR AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL AND INCREASE AS THE GVN </p><p>COMES TO VIEW RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES AS MORE ORGANIZED, MORE </p><p>PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY MORE POLITICAL. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
