<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ZAGREB 000669 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KAWC, PGOV, MARR, HR, KAWC, PGOV, MARR, HR, KAWC, PGOV, MARR, HR, IZ, IZPREL, IZPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: CROATIA\'S PM DISCUSSES GOC IRAQ POLICY </p><p>WITH AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE ROSSING FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C) PRIME MINISTER RACAN "INVITED THE AMBASSADOR FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00669  01 OF 03  251246Z </p><p>COFFEE" MARCH 24 TO CLARIFY THE GOC\'S REASONS FOR ADOPTING A </p><p>POSITION NOT ALIGNED WITH OURS ON IRAQ.  (THIS GOC POSITION </p><p>HAS BEEN PLAYED OUT UNHELPFULLY IN THE PRESS OVER RECENT </p><p>DAYS, AND THE AMBASSADOR CRITICIZED IT IN TWO INTERVIEWS.) </p><p>ONE-ON-ONE, RACAN LAID OUT HIS MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE U.S. </p><p>DECISION TO GO TO WAR WITHOUT A FINAL SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RESOLUTION.  HE SAID THE GOC\'S OPPOSITION TO BEING INCLUDED </p><p>IN THE COALITION OF THE WILLING WAS PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>SEVERE RISK OF A SPLIT IN THE GOVERNING  COALITION AND GOC </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  THAT WOULD HAVE DESTABILIZED CROATIA AND </p><p>ULTIMATELY THE REGION AND NOT BEEN IN THE U.S. INTEREST </p><p>EITHER.  RACAN CONFIRMED THAT THE GOC WOULD CONSIDER NEW </p><p>SUPPORT REQUESTS FOR COALITION OPERATIONS IF RECEIVED. </p><p>(COMMENT: BUT WE CONSIDER IT VERY UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT MUCH </p><p>MORE FROM CROATIA AND CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT PROTRACTED </p><p>POLITICAL DEBATE).  RACAN STRESSED THAT THE GOC REMAINS </p><p>COMMITTED IN THE WAR ON TERRORISM, BUT HE BELIEVED THE IRAQ </p><p>INTERVENTION WOULD COMPLICATE THAT EFFORT.  RACAN SAID THAT </p><p>THE OPPOSITION HDZ, IN TAKING A PRO-U.S. STANCE, AIMED TO </p><p>SCORE CHEAP POINTS WITH US WHILE IT CREATED NEW ARGUMENTS FOR </p><p>CURBING COOPERATION WITH ICTY UNDER A POTENTIAL FUTURE HDZ </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  RACAN\'S PRESENTATION, HARPING ON FAMILIAR </p><p>THEMES, UNDERSCORED ONCE AGAIN HIS LACK OF STRONG LEADERSHIP </p><p>AND THAT DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALWAYS HIS </p><p>CORE CONCERN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>DOMESTIC CONSTRAINTS CONSTRAIN GOC POSITION </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) AFTER TEN DAYS OF EXTENSIVE MEDIA BACK AND FORTH BY </p><p>CROATIA\'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OVER ITS IRAQ POLICY, PM RACAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00669  01 OF 03  251246Z </p><p>TOOK ADVICE FROM HIS AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON AND FROM HNS </p><p>PARTY LEADER VESNA PUSIC AND INVITED THE AMBASSADOR FOR </p><p>COFFEE MARCH 24 TO EXPLAIN HIS GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION </p><p>DIRECTLY.  HE SAID HE WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE TONE OF THE PUBLIC </p><p>POLEMIC.  CROATIA WAS IN A "VERY DELICATE" POSITION.  WHEN </p><p>THE U.S. FAILED TO SECURE A FINAL UNSC RESOLUTION BEFORE </p><p>STARTING HOSTILITIES, THE GOC WAS COMPELLED TO DECLINE OUR </p><p>INVITATION TO JOIN THE COALITION OF THE WILLING.  RACAN SAID </p><p>HE HAD NO CHOICE, AND THE AMBASSADOR\'S MARCH 19 INTERVIEW </p><p>STATEMENT THAT HE HAD NOT SHOWN LEADERSHIP FAILED TO </p><p>APPRECIATE THE PM\'S SEVERE POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS.  THE GOC </p><p>WAS DEEPLY DIVIDED, WITH HIMSELF AND FM PICULA AMONG THOSE </p><p>SUPPORTIVE; THEY WERE PITTED AGAINST FERVENT ANTI-WAR WING </p><p>LED BY PRESIDENT MESIC AND PARLIAMENT SPEAKER TOMCIC.  HAD HE </p><p>TRIED TO FORCE A POSITION SUPPORTIVE OF THE U.S., RACAN SAID </p><p>THE GOC WOULD HAVE SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE.  THAT WOULD HAVE </p><p>DESTABILIZED CROATIA AND THEREFORE THE REGION AND THEREFORE </p><p>DONE A DISSERVICE TO KNOWN U.S. INTERESTS.  "WHAT USE TO YOU </p><p>WOULD CROATIAN SUPPORT ON IRAQ BE IF IN THE PROCESS CROATIA </p><p>TURNED INTO A \'HOTSPOT?\'" </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) ALTHOUGH HE PUT HIMSELF IN THE MORE SYMPATHETIC </p><p>CAMP, RACAN EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE WAR WOULD HEIGHTEN </p><p>INSTABILITY FOR CROATIA, THE REGION AND THE WORLD.  APART </p><p>FROM HIS REGIONAL DESTABILIZATION ARGUMENT, RACAN WORRIED </p><p>ABOUT HEIGHTENED GLOBAL ANTI-AMERICANISM STEMMING FROM THE </p><p>CONFLICT -- BAD NOT ONLY FOR THE UNITED STATES BUT FOR THE </p><p>WORLD.  RACAN ALSO ARGUED WITH PERSONAL CONVICTION THAT THE </p><p>IRAQ WAR WOULD MAKE THE TERRORISM PROBLEM WORSE -- </p><p>TRANSFORMING WHAT HE SAW AS A SERIOUS BUT FINITE THREAT INTO </p><p>SOMETHING NOW MORE LIKELY TO BE "PERMANENT."  THIS HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00669  01 OF 03  251246Z </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR CROATIA TOO BECAUSE CROATIA REMAINS A </p><p>STEADFAST AND COMMITTED PARTNER IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST </p><p>GLOBAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>HDZ OPPORTUNISM - HIDDEN AGENDA REGARDING WAR CRIMES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C) CLEARLY IRRITATED THAT THE AMBASSADOR HAD HAD </p><p>ANYTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THE OPPOSITION HDZ PUBLICLY, RACAN </p><p>BOTH DISMISSED AND WARNED US ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE </p><p>PRO-U.S. POSITION TAKEN BY ITS LEADER IVO SANADER.  RACAN </p><p>SAID THAT ONE REASON FOR SANADER\'S STANCE WAS, OF COURSE, </p><p>SCORING CHEAP POLITICAL POINTS AGAINST THE GOC AND WITH </p><p>WASHINGTON; WE SHOULD NOT THINK SANADER OR THE HDZ SINCERE. </p><p>BUT MUCH OF THE HDZ HAD A SECOND, TROUBLING AGENDA THAT HE </p><p>HAD ALLUDED TO IN A MARCH 22 NEWSPAPER INTERVIEW: TO CREATE </p><p>NEW POLITICO-LEGAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>HAGUE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL (ICTY) FOR WHEN IT RETURNS TO </p><p>POWER.  LET\'S BE REAL, RACAN SAID: THE U.S., AS THE BIGGEST </p><p>POWER, COULD CHOOSE WHICH UNSCRS IT FOLLOWED AND WHICH NOT. </p><p>A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE CROATIA CANNOT, AND THUS THIS GOC IS </p><p>ADAMANT THAT CROATIA MUST HONOR ITS OBLIGATIONS TOWARD ICTY. </p><p>THE HDZ, HOWEVER, WILL ARGUE THAT WHAT\'S PERMITTED TO THE USG </p><p>IS PERMITTED TO CROATIA AND THUS IT NEED NOT, WITHOUT </p><p>QUESTION OR QUALIFICATION, COMPLY WITH SO-CALLED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS ON WAR CRIMES.  RACAN SAID HE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8326 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00669  02 OF 03  251246Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      MFLO-03  AC-01    NEA-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      DHS-00   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------4A4A84  251247Z /38 </p><p>O 251246Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9803 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 000669 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KAWC, PGOV, MARR, HR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: CROATIA\'S PM DISCUSSES GOC IRAQ POLICY </p><p>WITH AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>REJECTS THAT STANCE, BUT AVOIDING GIVING HDZ ARGUMENTS ANY </p><p>LEGS WAS A FURTHER ELEMENT IN THE GOC DECISION TO STAY AWAY </p><p>FROM THE IRAQ COALITION AND TAKE A STRICT CONSTRUCTIONIST </p><p>POSITION ABOUT UNSCRS GENERALLY. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: RACAN\'S FOCUS ON THE RISK OF DOMESTIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00669  02 OF 03  251246Z </p><p>DESTABILIZATION AND THEREFORE OF DAMAGING USG REGIONAL </p><p>INTERESTS SHOULD HE TAKE A BOLD DECISION IS FAMILIAR -- </p><p>ANYTIME A TOUGH CHOICE LOOMS, RACAN USES THE SAME ARGUMENT TO </p><p>SOLICIT USG "UNDERSTANDING" OF CROATIA\'S "UNIQUE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES."  WE NEVER HAVE BOUGHT IT AND DO NOT NOW, BUT </p><p>HIS FOCUS IS ALWAYS ON DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS, NO </p><p>MATTER THE IMPLICATIONS OF A DECISION FOR CROATIA\'S LARGER </p><p>INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>USG DISAPPOINTMENT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) AFTER RACAN SPOKE THUSLY FOR AN HOUR, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>REMARKED THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HAD HE HEARD THE PM\'S </p><p>EXPLANATION OF CROATIA\'S POLICY TEN DAYS AGO IN PRIVATE, </p><p>RATHER THAN READING ABOUT IT FOR OVER A WEEK IN THE PAPERS. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED HIS OWN DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE </p><p>DEBATE HAD BECOME SO PUBLIC.  WE REMAINED "DISAPPOINTED" AT </p><p>THE LACK OF GOC POLITICAL SUPPORT ON THIS HUGE, HISTORIC </p><p>ISSUE.  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS TENDED TO FADE IN SIGNIFICANCE </p><p>FOR THE USG AT THIS TIME.  BUT AT LEAST A TIMELY PRESENTATION </p><p>BY THE PM WOULD HAVE ALLOWED US TO INFORM WASHINGTON OF THE </p><p>GOC\'S MOTIVES BEFORE UNATTRACTIVE PRESS COMMENTARY BY HIM, </p><p>DPM GRANIC AND PRESIDENT MESIC HAD DONE SO.  THAT SAID, WE </p><p>AGREED THAT IT WAS BEST TO CIRCUMSCRIBE OUR AREA OF DISCORD, </p><p>FOCUS ON POSITIVES SUCH AS WHAT THE GOC HAD APPROVED FOR </p><p>LOGISTICAL SUPPORT, GWOT COOPERATION AND CROATIA\'S STATED </p><p>DESIRE TO PARTICIPATE IN POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ, AND </p><p>COOL THE MEDIA FEVER. </p><p> </p><p>RACAN: GOC STANCE POLITICAL, NOT LEGAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00669  02 OF 03  251246Z </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE AMBASSADOR REJECTED GOC ASSERTIONS THAT COALITION </p><p>MILITARY ACTION WAS "ILLEGITIMATE" OR IN CONTRAVENTION OF UN </p><p>RESOLUTIONS.  IT WAS ONE THING FOR THE GOC TO TAKE A </p><p>DIVERGENT POSITION ON POLITICAL GROUNDS, BUT ANOTHER TO </p><p>ASSERT THAT ITS STANCE HAD LEGAL FOUNDATION WHEN IT HAD </p><p>PRODUCED NO LEGAL ANALYSIS WHATSOEVER CONTRADICTING THE </p><p>ANALYSIS WE HAD PRESENTED TO THE GOC.  "SHOW US YOUR ANALYSIS </p><p>OR MODERATE YOUR RHETORIC."  RACAN REPLIED BY DISTANCING </p><p>HIMSELF FROM MESIC\'S TERMINOLOGY AND TONE.  CONTRARY TO </p><p>MESIC, RACAN AND THE GOVERNMENT HE LEADS HAD NOT </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE U.S. POSITION AS ILLEGITIMATE OR CONTRARY </p><p>TO UNSC RESOLUTIONS.  HE SAID THE GOC SAW NO PURPOSE IN THAT </p><p>SORT OF DEBATE AND WOULD NOT ENGAGE IN IT.  (COMMENT: MESIC </p><p>IS A FREE AGENT.  HE CLEARS NOTHING WITH RACAN OR THE MFA, SO </p><p>RACAN\'S ASSERTION IS PLAUSIBLE.  HOWEVER, RACAN PAINTED THE </p><p>MOST CONCILIATORY POSSIBLE PICTURE OF THE MFA\'S, HIS OWN AND </p><p>OTHER MINISTERS\'  STATEMENTS.  THEY HAVE NOT PUSHED THE LEGAL </p><p>ARGUMENT AS AGGRESSIVELY AS DID MESIC, BUT NEITHER HAVE THEY </p><p>STEERED AS WIDE AS RACAN CLAIMED.) </p><p> </p><p>PURPORTED ADDITIONAL USG SUPPORT REQUESTS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED RACAN TO EXPLAIN AN ASSERTION IN </p><p>HIS MARCH 22 INTERVIEW THAT CROATIA, WERE IT TO HAVE JOINED </p><p>THE COALITION OF THE WILLING, KNEW FROM "INFORMAL </p><p>CONSULTATIONS" WITH US THAT WE WOULD HAVE ASKED IT TO PROVIDE </p><p>MUCH MORE MILITARY HELP, IMPLICITLY INCLUDING DEPLOYMENT TO </p><p>IRAQ.  HE REMINDED RACAN THAT HE AND ALL U.S. OFFICIALS HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00669  02 OF 03  251246Z </p><p>BEEN VERY PRECISE IN DESCRIBING OUR LIMITED SUPPORT REQUESTS. </p><p> WE HAD TOLD CABINET MINISTERS REPEATEDLY THAT WE FORESAW </p><p>NO/NO CROATIAN MILITARY ROLE IN THE IRAQ CAMPAIGN BECAUSE ITS </p><p>ONLY DEPLOYABLE CAPABILITY WAS ALREADY IN ISAF.  RACAN WAS </p><p>INSISTENT THAT, FROM THE TIME OF OUR REQUEST FOR CIVIL AIR </p><p>CHARTER LANDING AUTHORIZATION, WE HAD BEEN "TESTING CROATIA" </p><p>BY IMPLYING FURTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>STRESSED THAT THAT WAS NOT SO; THAT WE HAD BEEN PRECISE; AND </p><p>THAT HE AND THE GOC OUGHT TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN TALKING TO </p><p>THE PRESS ABQ OUR DISCUSSIONS.  THIS WAS IN OUR MUTUAL </p><p>INTEREST, TO AVOID FANTASTIC MEDIA REPORTS OF IMMINENT U.S. </p><p>MILITARY BASING IN CROATIA.  (COMMENT: RACAN BETRAYED CLASSIC </p><p>BALKANS CONSPIRACY THEORY PROCLIVITIES.) </p><p> </p><p>GOC WOULD WEIGH FURTHER REQUESTS -- DON\'T HOLD YOUR BREATH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED POSITIVELY RACAN\'S STATEMENT IN </p><p>THE SAME INTERVIEW THAT, IF THE USG ASKED FOR FURTHER </p><p>LOGISTICAL SUPPORT, THE GOC WOULD CONSIDER IT SERIOUSLY. </p><p>THIS WAS ESPECIALLY WELCOME SINCE DPM GRANIC HAD SAID "NO </p><p>FURTHER APPROVALS" LAST WEEK.  WAS IT TRUE?  WHILE NO FURTHER </p><p>REQUESTS WERE NOW PENDING AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY MORE, </p><p>THERE MIGHT BE AND WE WOULD WANT SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) RACAN CONFIRMED THAT THE GOC WOULD CONSIDER ANY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8327 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00669  03 OF 03  251246Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      MFLO-03  AC-01    NEA-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      DHS-00   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------4A4A88  251247Z /38 </p><p>O 251246Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9804 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 000669 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KAWC, PGOV, MARR, HR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: CROATIA\'S PM DISCUSSES GOC IRAQ POLICY </p><p>WITH AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>FURTHER SUPPORT REQUESTS, INCLUDING PRESENTING THEM TO THE </p><p>SABOR IF THEIR CHARACTER WAS SUCH AS TO REQUIRE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>APPROVAL PURSUANT TO CROATIA\'S LAW.  (COMMENT: RACAN\'S </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO ENTERTAIN REQUESTS SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH </p><p>ANY COMMITMENT TO APPROVE THEM.  WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE MUCH </p><p>MORE SUPPORT FROM THE GOC.  ALMOST ANYTHING ADDITIONAL WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00669  03 OF 03  251246Z </p><p>NEED SABOR APPROVAL; ITS REACTION WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVE </p><p>AND COME ONLY AFTER PROTRACTED CONTROVERSY.) </p><p> </p><p>CALMING THE MEDIA FURORE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.   (C) THE AMBASSADOR CONCLUDED BY AGREEING WITH RACAN </p><p>THAT IT WAS IN NEITHER THE GOC\'S NOR OUR INTEREST TO PROLONG </p><p>MEDIA DEBATE AND SPECULATION THAT THE IRAQ DISAGREEMENT WILL </p><p>DRIVE OUR TWO COUNTRIES APART.  WE WERE DISAPPOINTED, AND </p><p>CROATIA\'S ABSENCE FROM THE LIST OF COALITION PARTNERS WAS </p><p>NOTICED IN WASHINGTON, BUT IT WOULD SERVE BOTH SIDES TO TURN </p><p>THE FOCUS ONTO AREAS OF AGREEMENT -- THE GWOT AND POST-WAR </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION IN PARTICULAR.  THE AMBASSADOR AND RACAN </p><p>AGREED ON A LOW-KEY MEDIA LINE ON THE MEETING WITH THAT </p><p>THEME.  BOTH RACAN AND THE EMBASSY\'S PD SECTION USED THOSE </p><p>THEMES IN ANSWERING PRESS QUERIES ABOUT THE MEETING, AND </p><p>PRESS COVERAGE OF THE MEETING MARCH 25 REFLECTED THEM. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
