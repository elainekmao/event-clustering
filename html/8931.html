Editorial on Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" </p><p>on 6/20 entitled "Kindergarten". "CAFTA negotiations have </p><p>encountered a serious obstacle because the Central American </p><p>countries have not been able to present a consistent </p><p>position, debilitating its already fragile negotiation </p><p>power, and evidencing the contradictions we face because we </p><p>do not want to understand the need to present ourselves as a </p><p>solid bloc." </p><p> </p><p>"From the beginning, Central America should have worked in </p><p>an unified project, considering the regional needs and </p><p>proposals. Before initiating the negotiations with the other </p><p>counterpart, Central America must have agreed on a common </p><p>position." </p><p> </p><p>"All these problems could have been easily avoided, because </p><p>from a good negotiation process we can come out with a CAFTA </p><p>with manageable disadvantages and far-reaching benefits for </p><p>everyone." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
