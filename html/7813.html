SUMMARY:  THE BUREAU OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING </p><p>GROUP (IGWG) FOR THE ELABORATION OF VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES </p><p>TO SUPPORT THE PROGRESSIVE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO </p><p>ADEQUATE FOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY </p><p>MET APRIL 28, 2003.  THE BUREAU PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT ON PROPOSED INTERSESSIONAL ACTIVITIES, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>STRESSING THE NEED TO KEEP WITHIN THE IGWG\'S MANDATE, AND </p><p>TO AVOID TOPICS (SUCH AS "THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION"), </p><p>WHICH LAY OUTSIDE THE MANDATE. THE BUREAU AGREED THAT A </p><p>BRIEFING BY UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD, </p><p>JEAN ZIEGLER, WAS NOT NECESSARY.  USDEL AND OTHER OECD </p><p>BUREAU MEMBERS WERE SURPRISED BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE </p><p>FAO LEGAL OFFICER SUPPORTING THE BUREAU\'S WORK ARGUED FOR </p><p>BROADENING THE SCOPE OF THE VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES BEYOND </p><p>NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY.  WITHIN THE BUREAU THERE IS </p><p>GENERAL AGREEMENT NOT TO RE-OPEN THE DEBATE ON THIS </p><p>QUESTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE BUREAU OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING GROUP </p><p>(IGWG) FOR THE ELABORATION OF VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE PROGRESSIVE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO </p><p>ADEQUATE FOOD (R2F) IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL FOOD </p><p>SECURITY MET APRIL 28, 2003. BUREAU MEMBERS IRAN (CHAIR), </p><p>U.S., BELGIUM, NEW ZEALAND AND MALI PARTICIPATED.  THE </p><p>PHILIPPINES AND BRAZIL WERE ABSENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GENERAL (ADG) HARTWIG DE HAEN </p><p>OPENED THE MEETING BY ASKING BUREAU VIEWS ON WHETHER THE </p><p>IGWG SHOULD BE "A SEPARATE SUB-ITEM" FOR THE 124TH FAO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01890  01 OF 03  050506Z </p><p>COUNCIL SESSION IN JUNE.  THE BUREAU AGREED THAT THIS WAS </p><p>NOT A NECESSARY; MEMBERS WHO WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE </p><p>IGWG COULD DO SO IN THE ITEM "REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON </p><p>WORLD FOOD SECURITY" (TO WHICH THE IGWG ITSELF REPORTS). </p><p>COMMENT: IT TURNS OUT THAT THE AGENDA HAD ALREADY BEEN </p><p>PRINTED UP WITH THE IGWG AS A SUB-ITEM, SO THE ADG\'S </p><p>"CONSULTATION" WAS MOOT (AND PROBABLY AN AFTER THOUGHT). </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE BUREAU APPROVED THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING </p><p>HELD ON THE LAST DAY OF THE IGWG.  THE FINAL VERSION </p><p>REFLECTED U.S.-PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE DRAFT MINUTES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE BUREAU DISCUSSED A LIST OF PROPOSED </p><p>INTERSESSIONAL ACTIVITIES DRAWN UP BY THE IGWG SECRETARY </p><p>BASED ON INPUTS FROM THE BUREAU AT ITS LAST SESSION AND </p><p>MEMBER COMMENTS AT THE IGWG SESSION.  THE SECRETARY </p><p>INFORMED THE GROUP THAT DONORS WERE READY TO PROVIDE </p><p>EXTRA-BUDGETARY FUNDING.  THE ACTIVITIES WERE PRICED AS </p><p>FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-- USD 160,000 FOR 8 TECHNICAL PAPERS (R2F IN PRACTICE; </p><p>R2F AND THE COVENANT ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL </p><p>(ESC) RIGHTS; MONITORING THE RIGHT TO FOOD, TARGETING </p><p>VULNERABLE GROUPS; THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION OF R2F, </p><p>SOCIAL SAFETY NETS; JUSTICIABILITY OF THE R2F AND FOOD </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY; </p><p>-- USD 180,000 FOR 6 CASE STUDIES (MALI, BRAZIL, INDIA, </p><p>NEPAL, SOUTH AFRICA AND UGANDA); </p><p>-- USD 300,000 FOR A REGIONAL MEETING OR EXPERT </p><p>CONSULTATION; AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01890  01 OF 03  050506Z </p><p>-- USD 1,200 FOR A PRESENTATION BY UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR </p><p>JEAN ZIEGLER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  BRAZIL (BY CORRESPONDENCE) EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR </p><p>INTERSESSIONAL PAPERS ON "SOCIAL SAFETY NETS," "CASE </p><p>STUDIES" AND "TARGETING AND REACHING DISADVANTAGED AND </p><p>VULNERABLE GROUPS."  THE U.S. AND BELGIUM ALSO SUPPORTED </p><p>THESE TOPICS.  MALI EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR ALL OF THE </p><p>PROPOSALS, BUT STATED THAT GETTING DOWN TO DRAFTING THE </p><p>GUIDELINES WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN COMMISSIONING A LOT OF </p><p>PAPERS. </p><p> </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>7. THE U.S., BELGIUM AND NEW ZEALAND ARGUED STRONGLY THAT </p><p>THE PROPOSED PAPER ON "THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION (WHICH </p><p>INCLUDED, INTER ALIA, SUB-TOPICS ON  "EXTRANATIONAL </p><p>OBLIGATIONS OF STATES" AND "R2F PRINCIPLES VIS A VIS </p><p>RULES GOVERNING INTERNATIONAL TRADE") WAS NOT WITHIN THE </p><p>MANDATE OF THE IGWG.  SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, THE </p><p>STRONGEST ADVOCATE FOR INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DIMENSION ALONG THESE LINES WAS THE FAO LEGAL OFFICER WHO </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1046 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01890  02 OF 03  050507Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  INL-00   WHA-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   UTED-00  FDRE-01  TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   SS-00    TEST-00  TRSE-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------5F7994  050507Z /38 </p><p>R 050505Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9637 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2656 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY MEXICO </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 001890 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>MEXICO CITY FOR BRAKEL </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA KOTOK AND L/HRR ANDRE SURENA </p><p>USAID FOR RALPH CUMMINGS </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR HUGHES AND REICH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, KUNR, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO RIGHT TO FOOD WORKING GROUP: INTERSESSIONAL </p><p>BUREAU MEETING </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01890  02 OF 03  050507Z </p><p>ARGUED THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS CONSISTENT WITH AND </p><p>NECESSARY BECAUSE OF COMMENT 12 OF THE COVENANT ON </p><p>ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS (WHICH COVERS THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION).  USDEL RESPONDED THAT THE IGWG </p><p>HAD NO MANDATE TO COVER ALL OF COMMENT 12 AND NEEDED TO </p><p>BE LIMITED TO THE NATIONAL CONTEXT.  THE U.S. AND NEW </p><p>ZEALAND ALSO STATED THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF </p><p>THE IGWG HAD CONCLUDED AT THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT FIVE </p><p>YEARS LATER MEETING AND SHOULD NOT BE REOPENED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE BUREAU DID AGREE THAT THE NATIONAL POLICIES TAKE </p><p>PLACE IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT, AND AGREED THAT THE </p><p>"INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION" MIGHT BETTER BE COVERED WITH </p><p>DISCUSSION OF TOPICS SUCH AS "AT WHAT POINT DO COUNTRIES </p><p>REQUIRE OR REQUEST INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO FULFILL </p><p>NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY NEEDS;" AND "WHAT WAS THE ROLE AND </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND STATES </p><p>AS MEMBERS OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO RESPOND TO </p><p>COUNTRY REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE." </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE U.S. NOTED THAT THE U.S. SIDE EVENT ON FOOD </p><p>SAFETY NETS TO BE HELD DURING THE UPCOMING COMMITTEE ON </p><p>WORLD FOOD SECURITY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CONTRIBUTION </p><p>TO THE DISCUSSION OF "SOCIAL SAFETY NETS" AND "TARGETING </p><p>DISADVANTAGED GROUPS." </p><p> </p><p>10.  UNDER DISCUSSION OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES, USDEL </p><p>NOTED THAT THE SECRETARIAT\'S PROPOSAL FOCUSED ON </p><p>"PROGRESS MADE...FROM A POLICY, LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>POINT OF VIEW."  USDEL ASKED THAT THE COUNTRY CASE </p><p>STUDIES (PROPOSED FOR BRAZIL, INDIA, MALI, NEPAL, SOUTH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01890  02 OF 03  050507Z </p><p>AFRICA AND UGANDA) ALSO COVER THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE </p><p>RIGHT TO FOOD POLICY HAD ACTUALLY AFFECTED NATIONAL FOOD </p><p>SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE BUREAU DISCUSSED THE PROPOSAL TO HAVE THE </p><p>SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD RETURN TO ROME TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE BUREAU.  NO BUREAU MEMBER SUPPORTED THE </p><p>PROPOSAL.  MALI NOTED THAT THAT "THE AFRICAN GROUP WAS </p><p>CONFUSED BY (ZIEGLER\'S) PRESENTATION" AT THE IGWG. </p><p> </p><p>12. THE BUREAU CONSIDERED THE FINAL "SYNTHESIS" REPORT </p><p>(WHICH INCLUDED SUBMISSIONS MADE AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE </p><p>IGWG) AND WORKING DOCUMENT 2 "ISSUES OF CONVERGENCE AND </p><p>DIVERGENCE" (WHICH ATTEMPTED TO INCORPORATE CORRECTIONS </p><p>TO THE DOCUMENT REQUESTED DURING THE IGWG).  USDEL STATED </p><p>THAT THE "CONVERGENCE AND DIVERGENCE" DOCUMENT STILL </p><p>CONTAINED A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS AND NOTED THAT IT WAS AN </p><p>INTERNAL DOCUMENT ONLY, INTENDED TO ASSIST THE BUREAU AND </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD </p><p>SECURITY AS PART OF THE REPORT OF THE IGWG. </p><p> </p><p>NEXT MEETINGS </p><p>------------- </p><p>13.  THE BUREAU WILL MEET THURSDAY JUNE 12 AT 10:00 </p><p>DURING THE CFS SESSION.  THE BUREAU WILL MEET JULY 9-11, </p><p>2003 TO CONSIDER A FIRST DRAFT OF THE GUIDELINES. </p><p> </p><p>QUESTION OF A RAPPORTEUR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01890  02 OF 03  050507Z </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>14.  THE EUROPEAN REGIONAL GROUP HAS QUERIED THE U.S. </p><p>AGAIN CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL TO ADD A RAPPORTEUR TO THE </p><p>BUREAU.  USDEL HAS CONSISTENTLY RESPONDED THAT THERE IS </p><p>NO NEED FOR A RAPPORTEUR (SEE REFTEL FOR ADDITIONAL </p><p>DISCUSSION).  WE EXPECT THE ISSUE TO BE RAISED AGAIN AT </p><p>THE NEXT IGWG SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>BUREAU SUBSTITUTION </p><p>------------------- </p><p>15.  REFTEL FAILED TO MENTION THAT THE IGWG AGREED THAT, </p><p>IN THE EVENT THAT A BUREAU MEMBER WAS ABSENT, A </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE REGION COULD SUBSTITUTE HIM OR </p><p>HER. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p>16.
