<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 006785 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S, D, M, AND NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ASEC, US, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: LESSENING THE BLOW TO THE GOJ OF MOVING TO </p><p>AUTHORIZED DEPARTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 6784 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 6695 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  If the Department approves our request for </p><p>authorized departure (ref A), we need to consider carefully </p><p>how to soften the political impact of this decision on </p><p>Jordan.  We should take steps to reassure the King and </p><p>government that the U.S. continues to attach great value to </p><p>the relationship, and that authorized departure will not </p><p>damage our commitment to Jordan.  We will also have to </p><p>consider carefully our public line and the impact it will </p><p>have on the perception of the United States in Jordan and the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>CALL FROM THE SECRETARY </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  If the Department decides to approve authorized </p><p>departure, and after the Ambassador has reported that </p><p>decision to King Abdullah, we recommend that the Secretary </p><p>call the King to reaffirm our strong commitment to Jordan -- </p><p>especially our continued work on supplemental military and </p><p>economic assistance packages -- and our intent to continue </p><p>with the broad range of programs and exchanges in which we </p><p>currently engage, including the availability of public </p><p>services such as visas.  The Secretary should thank the King </p><p>for the considerable security resources the GOJ has devoted </p><p>to protecting the American community.  He should explain that </p><p>the authorized departure decision does not represent a loss </p><p>of confidence in the government, its security forces, or its </p><p>commitment to protect Americans, but is rather a mechanism to </p><p>give a limited number of staff and family members the option </p><p>to leave post.  Likewise, we recommend that A/S Burns and/or </p><p>other senior USG officials subsequently reiterate these </p><p>points to PM Abul Ragheb, Foreign Minister Muasher, and other </p><p>senior officials (including a possible call from DCI Tenet to </p><p>GID Director Kheir). </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>MAINTAINING HIGH LEVEL OF EXCHANGES </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  It will be important that we demonstrate to the </p><p>Jordanians early on and in concrete terms that authorized </p><p>departure does not mean a lessening of the significant and </p><p>profitable bilateral programs we have in many different </p><p>areas:  military, intelligence, assistance, economic, law </p><p>enforcement, training, and political.  We need to ensure </p><p>that, to the maximum extent possible, we maintain these </p><p>exchanges at current levels.  Many of these exchanges rely </p><p>heavily on TDY personnel, however, and continuation of many </p><p>programs will therefore require a continued flow of TDY </p><p>support to the Mission from a number of agencies, including </p><p>AID, ORCA, DOD, FBIS, and others.  We need to examine putting </p><p>in place special arrangements to streamline and facilitate </p><p>the approval of TDY travel from State and other agencies. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>PUBLIC POSTURE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Our public posture on authorized departure should be </p><p>low key, but should reiterate our private message.  We </p><p>recommend including the following points: </p><p> </p><p>--  The decision results from an overall assessment of the </p><p>security situation in the wake of the Foley assassination. </p><p> </p><p>--  Jordanian security forces are making extraordinary </p><p>efforts to provide protection for Americans in Jordan, and to </p><p>identify and bring to justice the killers of Larry Foley. We </p><p>are confident those efforts will ultimately be successful. </p><p> </p><p>--  The decision is not an evacuation and will not result in </p><p>the closure of the Embassy or reduction of public services in </p><p>any way.  It is rather a device to allow some in the Embassy </p><p>community to exercise the option to leave post. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
