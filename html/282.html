<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 TAIPEI 03647 </p><p> </p><p>FOR AIT/W ALSO FOR EAP/RA/TC </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p>BEIJING ALSO PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CH, TW </p><p>SUBJECT: TAIWAN REACTIONS TO THE TIANANMEN MASSACRE </p><p> </p><p>REF: TAIPEI 3626 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  THE TAIWAN AUTHORITIES HAVE REACTED </p><p>TO THE DRAMATIC JUNE 4 EVENTS IN BEIJING BY MAKING A </p><p>SERIES OF DECLARATIONS.  PRESIDENT LEE ISSUED A </p><p>DENUNCIATION OF THE BLOODY SUPPRESSION OF THE TIANANMEN </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS AND A CALL FOR INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE PRC DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT.  A SIMILAR RESOLUTION WAS </p><p>ADOPTED BY THE KMT CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S SECOND PLENUM, </p><p>WHICH ABANDONED ITS AGENDA IN FAVOR OF AN ALL-DAY </p><p>DISCUSSION OF MAINLAND POLICY.  FOREIGN MINISTER LIEN </p><p>CHAN CALLED IN AMBASSADORS TO ASK FOR THEIR GOVERN- </p><p>MENTS\' SUPPORT, WHILE THE TAIWAN\'S ARMED FORCES WERE </p><p>PLACED ON ALERT AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.  MONEY IS </p><p>BEING COLLECTED IN SUPPORT OF THE DEMONSTRATORS, AND </p><p>TAIWAN\'S RED CROSS IS ATTEMPTING TO FIND WAYS TO </p><p>DELIVER ASSISTANCE.  MEANWHILE, PREMIER LEE HUAN AND </p><p>OTHERS HAVE DECLARED THAT TAIWAN\'S POLICY OF ALLOWING </p><p>VISITS TO THE MAINLAND WILL NOT CHANGE.  IN THE MIDST </p><p>OF CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PRC, </p><p>SOME VOICES HAVE BEEN RAISED CAUTIONING AGAINST </p><p>TAIWAN\'S TRADE WITH THE MAINLAND, AND WE EXPECT THAT </p><p>THE DETAILS, IF NOT THE OVERALL THRUST, OF TAIWAN\'S </p><p>MAINLAND POLICY WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE </p><p>DEBATE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE STUDENTS\' SUPPRESSION. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PRESIDENT LI TENG-HUI, IN A STATEMENT TO THE </p><p>KMT CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM JUNE 4, CONDEMNED THE </p><p>ATTACK BY THE PLA ON THE DEMONSTRATORS IN BEIJING.  LI </p><p>SAID THAT THE VIOLENCE IN BEIJING EXPOSES THE CRUELTY </p><p>OF THE COMMUNISTS AND WILL LEAD TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE </p><p>PRC GOVERNMENT.  HE CALLED ON OTHER COUNTRIES TO </p><p>CONDEMN THE COMMUNISTS AND ON OVERSEAS CHINESE TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE DEMONSTRATORS AND OPPOSE THE COMMUNISTS. </p><p>THE PRESIDENT ALSO WARNED OF POSSIBLE COMMUNIST </p><p>MILITARY MOVES AGAINST TAIWAN AND TOLD THE PEOPLE AND </p><p>THE ARMED FORCES TO BE ON THE ALERT.  HE PLEDGED </p><p>CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR RESISTANCE ON THE MAINLAND AND </p><p>STATED THAT THE GOAL OF TAIWAN IS TO "UNITE ALL ANTI- </p><p>COMMUNIST AND PATRIOTIC FORCES IN THEIR UNTIRING </p><p>EFFORT TO OVERTURN THIS TYRANNY." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE PRESIDENT\'S STATEMENT WAS ONE OF A </p><p>NUMBER OF DECLARATIONS IN THE WAKE OF THE TIANANMEN </p><p>CRACKDOWN.  THE KMT CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM, MEETING </p><p>YESTERDAY ON THE SECOND DAY OF ITS THREE-DAY SESSION, </p><p>SCRAPPED ITS ORIGINAL SCHEDULE AND DEVOTED THE ENTIRE </p><p>DAY TO A DISCUSSION OF MAINLAND POLICY.  A RESOLUTION </p><p>ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE CONDEMNED </p><p>THE MASSACRE OF THE STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS, DECLARED </p><p>CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM ON THE </p><p>MAINLAND, CALLED FOR LONG-TERM "MORAL AND MATERIAL </p><p>SUPPORT" FROM ABROAD FOR THIS GOAL AND URGED STRONG </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION AND UNSPECIFIED SANCTIONS </p><p>AGAINST THE PRC.  IT ALSO PLEDGED SUPPORT FOR CHINESE </p><p>COMPATRIOTS STRUGGLING TO COMPEL BEIJING TO GIVE UP </p><p>ITS "FOUR CARDINAL PRINCIPLES" AND "EVENTUALLY </p><p>OVERTURN THE CHINESE COMMUNIST TYRANNY." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  MEANWHILE, FOREIGN MINISTER LIEN CHAN MET WITH </p><p>AMBASSADORS ACCREDITED IN TAIPEI FROM SOUTH AFRICA, </p><p>SOUTH KOREA, HAITI, HONDURAS, AND GUATEMALA TO REQUEST </p><p>THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS CONDEMN THE ATTACK </p><p>AND TO DEMAND THAT PRC AUTHORITIES PUNISH THOSE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VIOLENCE.  WHILE THIS MEETING WAS </p><p>PUBLICIZED, THE PARALLEL APPROACH BY PRESIDENT LEE TO </p><p>AIT (REFTEL) HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED IN THE PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  IN A SEPARATE ACTION, PRESIDENT LEE ORDERED </p><p>THAT TAIWAN\'S ARMED FORCES BE PLACED ON ALERT TO </p><p>GUARD AGAINST ANY ATTACK FROM THE MAINLAND.  ARMED </p><p>FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF HAU PEI-TSUN CONFIRMED THE </p><p>ORDER, TELLING THE PRESS THAT HE SAW NO IMMINENT </p><p>THREAT TO TAIWAN\'S SECURITY BUT WAS CONCERNED THAT </p><p>THE PLA COULD TRY TO MAKE TROUBLE IN ORDER TO DIVERT </p><p>ATTENTION THE PRC\'S INTERNAL DISORDER.  DESPITE </p><p>THE INCREASED ALERT STATUS, AT LEAST ONE HIGH-RANKING </p><p>ADMIRAL WAS STILL ON THE GOLF COURSE SUNDAY AFTERNOON. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  THE DRAMATIC CRACKDOWN IN BEIJING HAS </p><p>IMMEDIATELY RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT TAIWAN\'S POLICY </p><p>TOWARD MAINLAND CONTACTS.  PREMIER LEE HUAN TOLD </p><p>REPORTERS JUNE 4 THAT THE POLICY OF ALLOWING PRIVATE </p><p>VISITS WOULD NOT ONLY CONTINUE, BUT SHOULD BE EXPANDED </p><p>EVEN FURTHER.  VICE PREMIER SHIH CHI-YANG, IN </p><p>CHARGE OF THE CABINET\'S MAINLAND TASK FORCE, LIKEWISE </p><p>STATED THAT CONTACTS WOULD CONTINUE, SINCE THEY SERVED </p><p>THE LONG-TERM PURPOSE OF FOSTERING DEMOCRACY.  TASK </p><p>FORCE SECRETARY MA YING-JEOU FOR HIS PART DECLARED </p><p>THAT TIANANMEN DEVELOPMENTS WOULD NOT AFFECT ONGOING </p><p>EFFORTS TO COMPLETE THE DRAFT REGULATIONS ON CROSS- </p><p>STRAIT CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  OTHER EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO INFLUENCE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRC.  THE DLRECTOR-GENERAL OF </p><p>TAIWAN\'S INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT CENTER, </p><p>JOHN NI, ANNOUNCED AT THE KMT PLENUM THE SETTING UP </p><p>OF A FUND TO FINANCE OVERSEAS ADVERTISING DENOUNCING </p><p>THE COMMUNISTS\' ACTIONS AND SOLICITING SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT.  THE GOAL IS REPORTED TO </p><p>BE A FUND OF USD 100 MILLION OF WHICH US$ 280,000 IS </p><p>SAID SO FAR TO HAVE BEEN RAISED.  THE LOCAL RED CROSS </p><p>SOCIETY WILL OFFER MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND SUPPLIES TO </p><p>THE PRC RED CROSS SOCIETY ACCORDING TO ITS SECRETARY- </p><p>GENERAL.  THIS FOLLOWS A PRESIDENTIAL DECISION, </p><p>REPORTED IN THE CENTRAL DAILY NEWS, THAT ASSISTANCE </p><p>BE OFFERED VIA THE INTER INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO </p><p>THE VICTIMS OF THE TIANANMEN VIOLENCE AND THEIR </p><p>FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  TAIWAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLYMEN, LEGISLATORS, AND </p><p>CONTROL YUAN MEMBERS FROM KMT AND OPPOSITION PARTIES </p><p>CONDEMNED THE ATTACK ON THE PRO-DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATORS. </p><p>COMMENTS INCLUDE CALLS BY KMT ASSEMBLYMEN AND </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL LEGISLATORS FOR THE TAIWAN AUTHORITIES TO </p><p>GIVE ALL POSSIBLE SUPPORT TO THE PROTESTORS AND TO MAKE </p><p>A CRITICAL REAPPRAISAL OF TAIWAN\'S POLLCY TOWARD THE </p><p>MAINLAND AS WELL AS EXPRESSIONS OF ANGER AND SORROW ON </p><p>THE PART OF OPPOSITION LEGISLATORS AT THE SUPPRESSION </p><p>OF DEMOCRACY ON THE MAINLAND. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN CALLS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE U.S., TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO PUT </p><p>AN END TO THE BLOODSHED IN BEIJING.  AIT HAS HAD </p><p>SEVERAL PRESS INQUIRIES ABOUT WHAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT </p><p>WOULD DO.  IN ADDITION, NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY </p><p>PROFESSOR THOMAS PENG, CLAIMING TO REPRESENT THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY FACULTY ASSOCIATION, CALLED AIT TO ASK </p><p>THAT THE U.S. SPEAK OUT STRONGLY AGAINST THE KILLING </p><p>OF DEMONSTRATORS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  OTHER REPORTED RESPONSES TO THE ATTACK </p><p>INCLUDE AN EXPRESSION OF SHOCK AND SORROW BY THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC PROGRESSIVE </p><p>PARTY WHO ATTRIBUTED THE VIOLENCE TO THE LACK OF </p><p>TOLERANCE FOR DEMOCRACY ON THE MAINLAND AND A REQUEST </p><p>OF THE CHINA DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY THAT JUNE 4 </p><p>BE DECLARED A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR THOSE KILLED IN </p><p>THE ATTACK AND THAT SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS BE AMENDED TO </p><p>RECORD THE EVENT.  A LIST OF ACTIONS REPORTED TO BE </p><p>UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE AUTHORITIES INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>--  A TEMPORARY LIFTING OF THE BAN ON DIRECT FAX </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE MAINLAND TO PERMIT MESSAGES </p><p>OF SUPPORT FOR THE DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT TO BE SENT TO </p><p>THE PRC. </p><p> </p><p>--  A PERIOD OF MOURNING FOR THOSE KILLED AT TIANANMEN </p><p>INCLUDING LOWERING THE TAIWAN FLAG TO HALF MAST. </p><p> </p><p>--  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A "MORE AGGRESSIVE" </p><p>MAINLAND POLICY IN WHICH TAIWAN AUTHORITIES WILL </p><p>PLAY A "MORE LEADING ROLE" IN INFORMING PEOPLE ON </p><p>THE MAINLAND OF TAIWAN\'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  COMMENT.  THE KMT\'S EVIDENT DETERMINATION </p><p>TO MAINTAIN ITS OPENING TO THE MAINLAND WAS SIGNALLED </p><p>THE DAY BEFORE THE PLA\'S ACTION IN TIANANMEN WHEN LEE </p><p>TENG-HUI ADDRESSED THE OPENING SESSION OF THE KMT </p><p>SECOND PLENUM.  IN HIS ADDRESS, LEE STATED THAT THE </p><p>EASING OF RESTRICTIONS ON VISITS "HAS MADE THE PEOPLE </p><p>ON THE CHINESE MAINLAND LONG FOR THE LIFE ON THE </p><p>ISLAND" AND HAS INCREASED THEIR DOUBTS ABOUT </p><p>COMMUNISM.  CALLS FOR DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM, LEE </p><p>DECLARED, ARE "ONE INESCAPABLE RESULT OF THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR MAINLAND POLICY."  DESPITE THIS, </p><p>THE BLOODSHED IN BEIJING MAY CAUSE THE AUTHORITIES </p><p>TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF TRADE AND </p><p>INVESTMENT IN THE PRC.  LEE HUAN DISTINGUISHED THIS </p><p>FROM THE QUESTION OF CONTINUING VISITS, AND SAID IT </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE STUDIED IN LIGHT OF EVENTS.  DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER CHENG WEI-YUAN IS QUOTED AS CALLING FOR TRADE </p><p>SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PRC, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR </p><p>WHETHER HIS REMARKS WERE INTENDED TO INCLUDE TAIWAN\'S </p><p>OWN TRADE WITH THE MAINLAND.  THE DETAILS OF TAIWAN\'S </p><p>MAINLAND POLICY ARE LIKELY TO BE THE SUBJECT OF INTENSE </p><p>DISCUSSION IN THE DAYS AHEAD.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEAN </p><p></p></div>
