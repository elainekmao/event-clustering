<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 000810 </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF/C - DIRECTOR HELEN LA LIME FROM BILL SWING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: CONGO:  "ROADMAP" TO A NEW RELATIONSHIP </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>1. (C) "NEW WINE IN NEW BOTTLES...?" </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>IT WOULD BE IN OUR POLICY INTERESTS TO COME TO AN </p><p>UNDERSTANDING EARLY IN BOTH THE NEW WASHINGTON AND KINSHASA </p><p>ADMINISTRATIONS ON WAYS AND MEANS TO PUT US/CONGO (DRC) </p><p>RELATIONS ON A NEW FOOTING.  IN THIS REGARD, THE ROADMAP, AS </p><p>PROPOSED, IS DESIGNED TO CREATE MOMENTUM IN THE LUSAKA </p><p>PROCESS.  IN SO DOING, THE POLITICAL WILL AND CAPACITY OF </p><p>PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA TO UNDERTAKE A PROGRAM OF PEACE, </p><p>NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND ECONOMIC REFORM WILL ALSO BE PUT </p><p>TO A TEST.  CLEARLY, OUR ABILITY TO MOVE TO A NEW LEVEL IN </p><p>OUR RELATIONS WILL DEPEND ON THE DRC\'S COMMITMENT TO PROGRESS </p><p>ON BOTH THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL TRACKS OF THE LUSAKA </p><p>AGREEMENT.  OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN TO GROUP THE POINTS ALONG </p><p>THE ROADMAP ACCORDING TO DEGREES OF DIFFICULTY IN </p><p>IMPLEMENTING RATHER THAN THE MORE CUSTOMARY CATEGORIES OF </p><p>SHORT-, MEDIUM-, AND LONG-TERM.  SEVERAL OF THE MEASURES HAVE </p><p>BEEN RECENTLY PROPOSED IN MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT KABILA AND, </p><p>AS SUCH, ARE ALREADY UNDER CONSIDERATION IN WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>2.

(THIS WOULD RECTIFY THE CURRENT </p><p>PERCEPTION THAT OUR POLICY IS BIFURCATED -- WITH THE EMBASSY </p><p>DEALING WITH THE CONGOLESE GOVERNMENT AND WASHINGTON -- OR </p><p>OUR EMBASSIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES -- WITH THE REBELS.) </p><p> </p><p>-- OFFER TO ASSIST PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA IN THE TRAINING OF </p><p>A PROFESSIONAL "CLOSE-IN" PROTECTION TEAM. </p><p> </p><p>-- RESPOND POSITIVELY TO PRESIDENT KABILA\'S REQUEST FOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN COMBATING CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT.

IN SO DOING, (A) </p><p>EXAMINE THE FRENCH  PROPOSAL TO DEPLOY UN PEACEKEEPING TROOPS </p><p>AT THE BORDER BETWEEN THE CONGO AND RWANDA, WHICH THE FRENCH </p><p>VIEW AS THE "HEART OF THE PROBLEM"; AND (B) CALIBRATE US </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE FRENCH DEMAND THAT A "DATE CERTAIN" BE SET </p><p>FOR RWANDAN/UGANDAN TROOP WITHDRAWAL IN RETURN FOR FRENCH </p><p>SUPPORT FOR DDRR OF EX-FAZ/INTERAHAMWE -- ALL THE WHILE </p><p>AVOIDING ANY LINKAGE BETWEEN THE WITHDRAWAL AND "NEGATIVE </p><p>FORCES" ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>-- INSIST THAT ALL PARTIES RETREAT TO POSITIONS DECLARED IN </p><p>KAMPALA DISENGAGEMENT PLAN.
