<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000380 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, YM, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ:  EVOLVING YEMENI ATTITUDES TOWARD A POSSIBLE </p><p>WAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol/Econ Acting Chief Catherine J. Westley for Reason 1. </p><p>5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  ROYG policy and Yemeni street opinion </p><p>publicly oppose a war in Iraq, but the underlying reality is </p><p>more nuanced.  The public line articulated by Saleh and </p><p>senior officials strongly denounces war and advocates </p><p>concerted Arab action to prevent it, but includes no/no </p><p>expression of support or sympathy for Saddam Hussein.  Most </p><p>Yemenis remain more concerned with day-to-day matters, </p><p>including the poor economy and the upcoming parliamentary </p><p>elections, and numerous contacts have expressed support for </p><p>removing the Baathi regime if/if this is accomplished with </p><p>minimal impact on civilians.  UNSC-related diplomacy which </p><p>has received dramatic coverage in the West has received </p><p>minimal public and media attention in Yemen.  Nevertheless, </p><p>popular reaction could be vehement and emotional if war </p><p>seemed to drag on, or if Iraqi civilians were killed in a </p><p>high-profile incident.  Contacts almost universally express </p><p>hope that the war will be finished quickly.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)   Media statements from ROYG leaders continue to </p><p>oppose war in Iraq.  President Saleh has used domestic media </p><p>to maintain a high public profile out of the Non-Aligned </p><p>Movement Summit in Malaysia, saying that the NAM meeting and </p><p>the upcoming Arab Summit "should not be merely a verbal </p><p>phenomenon that repeats words of condemnation and </p><p>denunciation."  An editorial this week in the official daily </p><p>al-Thawra said, "Iraq will be the first field of </p><p>confrontation and it is the real test for the capability of </p><p>the Arabs and Muslims to defend themselves."  At the same </p><p>time, opposition to war is couched in terms of support for </p><p>the Iraqi people and not Saddam or the Baathi regime. </p><p>Numerous influential Yemeni contacts told the Ambassador this </p><p>week that the removal of Saddam will be good for the region. </p><p>Several predicted that only significant civilian casualties </p><p>would elicit a vehement popular reaction in Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Powerful military commander of the northern region </p><p>Ali Muhsen Saleh al-Ahmar recently told the DATT that the </p><p>Arab people would prefer no war, but the main concern was </p><p>about how the "American occupation" would be viewed.  He also </p><p>said that there could be flashpoints of reaction here in </p><p>Yemen, but expressed confidence that the ROYG could handle </p><p>it. </p><p> </p><p>4,  (C)  An official in the President\'s office told </p><p>Pol/Econoff that he wished the war would be over with </p><p>quickly, and that if must happen it should happen now without </p><p>further delays.  This sentiment was echoed to Acting Pol/Econ </p><p>Chief by a leading NGO human rights activist who said "get it </p><p>over with already."  Several journalist contacts expressed </p><p>suspicion about American motives in going to war and echoed a </p><p>familiar line in regional media: that the timing of the </p><p>Middle East Partnership Initiative announcement in December </p><p>created questions in Arab minds about what America is "really </p><p>trying to do" in this region. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  At the same time, opposition media hype has been </p><p>fairly low-key in recent days.  For example, out of three </p><p>weekly opposition newspapers, only one contained an article </p><p>on Iraq, noting matter-of-factly that a small anti-war </p><p>demonstration was held in Taiz. UNSC diplomacy and the </p><p>prospect of a new UNSCR has received understated media </p><p>attention in Yemen (far less than the President\'s daily </p><p>statements on Iraq), and even contacts firmly opposed to war </p><p>do not see efforts by France et al. in the Council as likely </p><p>to forestall conflict. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Yemeni public reaction is opposed to a possible war; </p><p> however, the vehemence of opposition is not as acute as </p><p>concern for internal Yemeni matters and the Palestinian </p><p>issue.  With parliamentary elections coming in two months\' </p><p>time and a worsening economy, many Yemenis are more concerned </p><p>with how to feed their families. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Comment:  President Saleh and other government </p><p>leaders are playing up their opposition rhetoric, partially </p><p>as a means to keep the "street" in line.  However, the </p><p>underlying reality in Yemen is a studied balance of support </p><p>for the Iraqi people and conspicuous non-support for Saddam. </p><p>Those Embassy contacts who urge a quick end to a war they see </p><p>as inevitable appear to be fatigued by the limbo imposed by </p><p>the last several months\' wait, and perhaps concerned about </p><p>what a prolonged war would mean for internal Yemeni issues </p><p>like the parliamentary elections.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
