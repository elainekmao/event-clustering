<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008385 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EPET, EMIN, KSAC, AMGT, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: WEEKLY ECONOMIC REPORT - WEEK OF DECEMBER 11 - </p><p>DECEMBER 17 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: Gasoline and diesel prices rose on </p><p>December 11, and public transportation fares went up 50 </p><p>percent on the 13th.  Kinshasa\'s motor fuel supplies </p><p>were adequate but the GDRC twice closed service </p><p>stations without providing advance notice, causing </p><p>confusion. The Congolese franc weakened on the parallel </p><p>market to about 130 Congolese francs per US dollar. </p><p>Hewa Bora Airways acquired a Lockheed 1011 aircraft. </p><p>Another new GSM cellular phone service was launched on </p><p>December 15.  Two men were convicted of the December </p><p>7th attack on Central Bank Governor Masangu in which </p><p>his bodyguard was killed.  They were sentenced to death </p><p>by a military court, and were executed in public, along </p><p>with eight others, on December 14.  Inflation rose </p><p>sharply following the increase in fuel prices and </p><p>public transit fares.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MOTOR FUEL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The price of gasoline rose from 45 congolese </p><p>francs (fc) to 70 fc and the price of diesel fuel rose </p><p>from 40 fc to 66 fc on Monday, December 11.  (On </p><p>January 1, 2000, gasoline cost only 3.1 fc per liter; </p><p>over the course of the year fuel prices have increased </p><p>over 2000 percent.) Fuel stocks at SEP, the national </p><p>distribution company, were adequate and no lines formed </p><p>except on Wednesday and Sunday, when stations were </p><p>closed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Fuel supplies currently in Kinshasa came from a </p><p>new supplier.  Rumors that this was a substandard </p><p>product circulated throughout the city and were </p><p>repeated in the press.  The GDRC closed stations on </p><p>Wednesday in order to perform tests on the quality of </p><p>gasoline.  The GDRC announced that the tests confirmed </p><p>the quality of the product, although some contacts </p><p>claim they also showed a lower lead content than past </p><p>deliveries to Kinshasa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Sunday\'s closure is part of a new policy to reduce </p><p>consumption.  Industry contacts believe this is </p><p>appropriate, and say it was part of the package of </p><p>measures attached to the price hike.  The GDRC, </p><p>however, made no public announcement about the Sunday </p><p>closure, leaving motorists angry and confused.  The </p><p>price of black market fuel hit a new high on Sunday of </p><p>about 200 fc per liter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MONETARY UPDATE/EXCHANGE RATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Congolese franc weakened on the parallel </p><p>market to about 130 Congolese francs per US dollar. </p><p>The official exchange rate remains 50 francs per </p><p>dollar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TRANSPORTATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Following the fuel price hike Monday morning, </p><p>minibus and taxi owners kept their vehicles off the </p><p>street pending a fare hike, leaving Kinshasa\'s </p><p>commuters to make the long walk into the center city. </p><p>On Tuesday evening, December 12, the GDRC raised public </p><p>transportation fares 50 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The delivery of new and renewed drivers licenses </p><p>was halted when the company contracted to produce them </p><p>ran out of necessary imported materials.  This follows </p><p>recent similar interruptions in the supply of license </p><p>plates and tax stamps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LOCAL ECONOMIC NEWS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Hewa Bora Airways (formerly Congo Airlines or </p><p>CAL) acquired from Delta Airlines a Lockheed 1011 </p><p>aircraft for use on passenger flights to Europe.  A </p><p>second L1011 will be delivered in the first quarter of </p><p>2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Cellular phone service provider SAIT launched </p><p>its "Oasis" GSM service on December 15.  The GDRC\'s </p><p>Office of Post and Telecommunications announced that it </p><p>would provide cellular phone service in partnership </p><p>with ZIDCO Holdings, a Zimbabwean company. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) On December 11 the Military Court sentenced two </p><p>men to death for the December 7 attack on Central Bank </p><p>Governor Jean-Claude Masangu.  (Masangu\'s bodyguard and </p><p>another man were killed in the attack.)  On December 14 </p><p>eight convicted men, including the two convicted of the </p><p>Masangu attack, were publicly executed as a warning to </p><p>other undisciplined members of security forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. A local newspaper reported that Masangu was rumored </p><p>to have offered his resignation following the attack. </p><p>Masangu wrote a letter to the paper\'s editor denying </p><p>the report and declaring his firm intention to continue </p><p>to defend the Congolese franc and to fight against </p><p>inflation. </p><p>12.
