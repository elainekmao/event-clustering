<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 ABUJA 002226 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/06/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, OIIP, OPRC, PINR, KPAO, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: STAR INTERVIEW -- ARMY MINISTER BATAGARAWA </p><p>PUBLICLY ADVANCES THE MIL-MIL RELATIONSHIP </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 2072 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 1436 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) In the "Star Interview" section of the Daily Trust </p><p>newspaper on August 30, Army Minister Lawal Batagarawa </p><p>expressed his views on the security assistance relationship </p><p>with the United States and on Operation Focus Relief, in </p><p>addition to other topics relating to the Nigerian military </p><p>and Ministry of Defense.  The Daily Trust is a newspaper </p><p>produced in Abuja (unlike the majority of Nigerian dailies </p><p>produced in Lagos), and has a significant readership in the </p><p>North.  Northerners have been the most suspicious of U.S. </p><p>activities vis-a-vis the military. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Batagarawa had been aware of a desire on the part of </p><p>the Embassy to have a larger and more focused media campaign </p><p>on OFR and the MPRI programs, particularly to address rumors </p><p>of "U.S. espionage," but had stated that the GON should lead </p><p>this cause (Ref B).  Recent public statements by President </p><p>Obasanjo and Minister of Defense Danjuma on these topics, in </p><p>addition to this particularly noteworthy interview, clearly </p><p>demonstrate the Army Minister making good on his promise. </p><p>The article is reproduced in its entirety in para 5 </p><p>(particularly noteworthy sections are in all caps). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Batagarawa, since the inception of his tenure in </p><p>February, has played a key role in working with the Mission </p><p>to advance U.S. and Nigerian interests in regards to </p><p>military-to-military programs.  His willingness to personally </p><p>intervene as Acting Minister of Defense on the security </p><p>assistance program (Ref A) led to the eventual transfer of </p><p>funds for the MPRI program.  Moreover, through his good </p><p>offices, ODC Abuja now meets biweekly with Ministry of </p><p>Defense officials to work together to advance the Embassy\'s </p><p>security assistance program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Batagarawa is clearly intelligent, thoughtful, and </p><p>unlike many of his colleagues, willing to make decisions on </p><p>the spot when he perceives them to be in the best interests </p><p>of Nigeria.  Batagarawa may travel to the U.S. in early </p><p>October.  If he does, Mission strongly urges the Department </p><p>and relevant Washington agencies to engage seriously and </p><p>"roll out the red carpet" for this impressive interlocutor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Daily Trust, August 20, 2001 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. is not on a Spying Mission - Batagarawa:  Mallam </p><p>Lawal Batagarawa is the Minister of State, for Defense, Army. </p><p> In this interview with Hameed M. Bello, our Senior Reporter, </p><p>he comments on renovations in the barracks, the \'downsizing\' </p><p>of the army, the Nigerian/U.S. military partnership, </p><p>pensioners within the Army, the War College, and more. </p><p>Excerpts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: Did your appointment as Minister of State, for Defense, </p><p>Army, come to you as a surprise? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: Well, I am not sure I am competent to comment on my </p><p>appointment, so I would rather leave that question. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: How have soldiers in the barracks fared since the advent </p><p>of this regime in terms of welfare facilities, and so on? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: Well, first of all, I will split your question into two. </p><p>One is how do the private soldiers in the barracks feel.  The </p><p>most competent person to answer that question is the soldiers </p><p>in the barracks.  On the issue of the dilapidation of the </p><p>barracks, we are dealing with these problems at two levels. </p><p>First of all, there is a presidential committee on barracks </p><p>rehabilitation, whose chairman is a senior officer from the </p><p>Federal Ministry of Works, with representatives from the </p><p>Army, Navy, Airforce and the Police.  They are to handle and </p><p>rehabilitate barracks for these four services.  Their modus </p><p>operandi is that for now they have taken one major barracks </p><p>from each of the services and they are concentrating their </p><p>activities on those barracks.  The idea is simple.  It is to </p><p>concentrate resources so that we have the maximum effect, </p><p>rather than spread money in such a way that the effect is not </p><p>felt at all.  I will give you a very simple example.  If you </p><p>allocate N250 million, let\'s say to rehabilitate police </p><p>barracks what it will come to about N1 million per barracks, </p><p>you will agree with me that such an effort will have no </p><p>impact at all.  That is why the decision is that you </p><p>concentrate your resources on specific barracks so that you </p><p>achieve the maximum effect.  In other words the Army, Navy, </p><p>Airforce and the Police have money within their budgetary </p><p>allocation for this year for barracks maintenance and </p><p>rehabilitation.  Now, what we are doing is to pick barracks </p><p>across the country and try to attend to part of the barracks </p><p>with the resources that are available.  But again we are </p><p>concentrating efforts and resources in specific locations, </p><p>not all over the country.  Again what we want to do is </p><p>systematically bring all the barracks to the required </p><p>standard, but we do not have the resources to do all of that </p><p>at the same time, so we make selections across the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: The Defense Minister has said that military commanders </p><p>would be involved in the renovation of the various barracks. </p><p>Since government is emphasizing the reprofessionalization of </p><p>the military, won\'t that go contrary to government\'s efforts </p><p>in this direction? </p><p>A: I think you are approaching it from the wrong perspective. </p><p> A commander in any particular location is responsible for </p><p>the welfare and upkeep of his troops with their families. </p><p>That includes ensuring that the barracks is habitable.  So if </p><p>you do not involve him at the level of supervision, who else </p><p>can supervise this work?  Is it just the professionals who </p><p>will come today and go away?  He knows the minute details of </p><p>what is wrong in those barracks.  He has to certify that </p><p>those weaknesses or defects in the barracks have been dealt </p><p>with, and that is the involvement that the Minister of </p><p>Defense is talking about.  It is not that he (the commander) </p><p>would be the one awarding contracts, supervising the </p><p>contracts and satisfying the contractors.  That is a </p><p>professional job meant for architects and quantity surveyors </p><p>and engineers.  He is to ensure that things are done </p><p>correctly to the satisfaction of his officers and men.  That </p><p>is the level to which he would be involved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: Some two years ago when this administration came into </p><p>power, one of the visions of the regime was to downsize the </p><p>military to make it mobile and provide facilities for them. </p><p>It seems as if this downsizing has been stopped.  What is </p><p>responsible for the stoppage sir? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: Well, you have supplied part of the answer yourself.  You </p><p>will agree with me that this government in each situation </p><p>where it has committed itself to a particular activity, we </p><p>normally study the situation based on the objective we want </p><p>to achieve, and then study is thoroughly analyzed and then on </p><p>the basis of the detailed knowledge we then go about meeting </p><p>our objective.  We are in the process of studying the </p><p>components that will determine what is the optimum size of </p><p>the military we require.  What sort of equipment do we need </p><p>to provide for that military?  So this is not something that </p><p>you will jump into.  It is something that you have to study </p><p>thoroughly, you know.  You have to take into account the </p><p>training you require.  You decide what is the optimum level </p><p>of the military you require, then you straighten-out the </p><p>hardware on the basis of that.  Then you work out the </p><p>training requirements on the basis of that also.  It is when </p><p>you do all this work and you have all the different </p><p>components in perspective, that you begin to act.  Another </p><p>issue that you have to take into consideration, which is </p><p>something you know very well, is the fact that the military </p><p>is not like all human institutions.  It is not something that </p><p>is static; it is dynamic.  Certain circumstances have changed </p><p>between 1999 and today, and whatever we have to do we have to </p><p>talk them into consideration, and we are taking those factors </p><p>that have changed into consideration to determine what we are </p><p>doing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: NIGERIA AND U.S. HAVE A MILITARY PARTNERSHIP, WHICH GAVE </p><p>BIRTH TO OPERATION FOCUS RELIEF (TRAINING FOR COMBAT </p><p>READINESS).  NIGERIANS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS PARTNERSHIP. </p><p>SOME ARE EVEN SAYING THAT AMERICANS ARE ON AN ESPIONAGE </p><p>MISSION.  WHAT CLARIFICATION CAN YOU MAKE ON THIS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES </p><p>NIGERIA HAS DEFENSE COOPERATION AGREEMENTS WITH.  UNITED </p><p>STATES OF AMERICA IS ONE, THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC IS ANOTHER. </p><p>OTHERS ARE SOUTH AFRICA, IRAN AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS.  WE </p><p>HAVE MILITARY COOPERATION AGREEMENTS WITH THEM.  AS A </p><p>CONSEQUENCE OF THESE MILITARY AGREEMENTS, WE HAVE TWO </p><p>PROGRAMMES WITH THE U.S.  ONE IS OPERATION FOCUS RELIEF. </p><p>FOCUS RELIEF IS TARGETED AS FOLLOWS: A NUMBER OF NATIONS ARE </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING MISSION IS SIERRA </p><p>LEONE AND NIGERIA IS ONE OF THEM.  THE U.S. ASSISTS THESE </p><p>COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE PEACEKEEPING MISSION IS SIERRA </p><p>LEONE WITH TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT.  SO, IT IS ALL THE </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE PEACEKEEPING MISSION IN </p><p>SIERRA LEONE.  FORCUS RELIEF IS TARGETED AT ALL THE COUNTRIES </p><p>PARTICIPATING IN THE PEACEKEEPING MISSION IN SIERRA LEONE. </p><p>THE SECOND IS THE MPRI PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: WHAT IS MPRI? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: MPRI IS: MILITARY PROFESSIONAL RESOURCE INCORPORATED.  IT </p><p>IS ESSENTIALLY A GROUP OF RETIRED, RESPONSIBLE MILITARY </p><p>OFFICERS OF AMERICAN ORIGIN WHO ARE EMPLOYED BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF THE U.S. TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO FRIENDLY </p><p>COUNTRIES LKIKE NIGERIA THAT HAVE MILITARY COOPERATION </p><p>AGREEMENTS WITH THEM.  WHAT DO THEY DO?  IT IS A SIMPLE THING </p><p>- WE SIT IN NIGERIA AND LOOK AT OUR MILITARY AND IDENTIFY </p><p>WHAT ARE THE WEAKNESSES IN OUR MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT.  THE </p><p>MILITARY AND THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE WOULD SIT DOWN AND </p><p>IDENTIFY WHAT ARE OUR AREAS OF WEAKNESSES.  THEN WE SIT DOWN </p><p>WITH THESE MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM THE UNITED STATES WHO HAVE </p><p>SERVED IN A NUMBER OF COMMANDS AND STAFF POSTS.  WE WILL ASK </p><p>THEM IN WHAT WAY SHOULD WE DEAL WITH THESE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. </p><p> THE POINT IS SIMPLE, WE LEAD, THEY SUPPORT US.  THERE IS </p><p>NOTHING LIKE A SPYING MISSION.  IF WE HAVE PROFESSIONALS WHO </p><p>HAVE VARIED EXPERIENCE IN NIGERIA, WE WILL USE THEIR </p><p>SERVICES.  THE U.S. OFFICIALS PARTICIPATING IN MPRI ARE </p><p>PAIRED WITH NIGERIAN MILITARY OFFICERS, AND WHATEVER THEY DO, </p><p>IS CARRIED OUT JOINTLY.  WE DON\'T ALLOW THE AMERICANS TO GO </p><p>INTO AREAS WE CONSIDER SENSITIVE TO OUR SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: I RECALL THAT THE NIGERIAN ARMY HAS A RESERVE LIST WHICH </p><p>IS SUPPOSED TO BE A LIST OF OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN RETIRED </p><p>FROM THE ARMY AND SOME OF THEM HAVE SEEN BATTLE, ESPECIALLY </p><p>IN BIAFRA.  WHY HAVEN\'T WE DRAWN FROM THE POOL OF THESE </p><p>VETERANS?  IS THERE ANYTHING UNIQUE ABOUT THE MPRI THAT WE </p><p>NEED TO LEARN FROM? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LET ME START WITH THE SIMPLEST </p><p>POSITION.  YOU CAN ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING NEW FROM ANOTHER </p><p>PERSON.  YOU LEARN EVERYDAY FROM YOUR CHILD.  THAT IS A FACT </p><p>OF LIFE.  SO, FOR EVERY OFFICER IN THE MPRI PROGRAMME, WE </p><p>HAVE HIS NIGERIAN COUNTERPART, BOTH SERVING AND RETIRED IN </p><p>WHICH CASE WE ARE ALREADY TAPPING INTO THE EXPERIENCE OF SOME </p><p>OF OUR RETIRED PERSONNEL AS COUNTERPARTS TO THOSE AMERICANS. </p><p>SECONDLY, THERE IS SOMETHING UNIQUE ABOUT THESE PEOPLE. </p><p>FIRST, TECHNOLOGICALLY, THEY HAVE AN EDGE OVER US.  NUMBER </p><p>TWO, IN TERMS OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCES, THE AMERICAN ECONOMY </p><p>HAS DEVELOPED MANGEMENT SCIENCES TO AN ART, AND THERE IS </p><p>SOMETHING WE CAN LEARN FROM IN THIS REGARD.  IN INFORMATION </p><p>TECHNOILOGY, WE CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM THEM.  WE ARE ALSO </p><p>LEARNING FROM THE NIGERIAN VETERANS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK THE AMERICANS STAND TO GAIN FROM THE </p><p>PARTNERSHIP? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LET ME START FROM PEACEKEEPING </p><p>OPERATIONS.  EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD HAS SOMETHING TO GAIN IF </p><p>THE WORLD IS AT PEACE.  THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES OF THE WQORLD </p><p>WOULD FLOURISH.  WE HAVE SEEN THE CATASTROPHES IN SOMALIA, IN </p><p>THE WAR BETWEEN ERITREA AND ETHIOPIA, IN THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p>AMERICANS HAVE AN INTEREST IN PEACE RETURNING TO THOSE AREAS </p><p>JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.  IF THERE IS PEACE IN NIGERIA, THEY </p><p>WILL COME AND INVEST, AND MAKE PROFIT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: What is the cause in the delay in the payment of pensions? </p><p> Why does the Ministry default in payment as and when due? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: First of all, as you are aware, pensions in the last two </p><p>years have been reviewed about three times.  The increase in </p><p>the amount of pension has gone up about 400 percent or more, </p><p>about 600 percent, if I am correct.  That has increased the </p><p>volume of money we are to pay as pension.  The second thing </p><p>that has happened was that a lot of people who were entitled </p><p>to pension, were not collecting pension because the previous </p><p>amount was meager.  All of them have come back into the </p><p>pension scheme because the money is now important to them. </p><p>Those not in the system before, you are not aware of them </p><p>because maybe they have died, or for whatever reason they are </p><p>not there.  Now that they have come, it will change your </p><p>budgetary allocation making it inadequate.  These twin </p><p>problems are basically things that have created a backlog. </p><p>The third issue is that there are a lot of people who are not </p><p>entitled to pension but who are doing everything they can to </p><p>ensure they get on the pensioners\' list.  Because of the </p><p>activities of these bad eggs, we have to be cautious so that </p><p>due process of establishing who is entitled to pension is </p><p>followed, and these massive increases have taken place on the </p><p>basis of the two things I have identified means that we have </p><p>to make adjustments.  The budgetary system now if different </p><p>from what is was before.  This time, once you go before the </p><p>National Assembly and they approve the budget, if you wish to </p><p>change it, you have to take a supplementary appropriation </p><p>bill to them, which has to get through due process.  A </p><p>combination of these factors is responsible for the delays. </p><p>We hope that these problems will be solved between now and </p><p>December and with effect from January 1, we should not have </p><p>any problem with the pensions.  We hope by them, we would </p><p>have had our facts and figures ready. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: Sir, there has been this allegation that even the </p><p>selection process to the War College has been so politicized </p><p>that those who do not merit to be there have been admitted. </p><p>What comment do you have on this? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: I do not comment on speculations.  If you say it has been </p><p>alleged, then what is the basis of the allegation?  Unless </p><p>you have certain specific cases on the basis of which I can </p><p>respond, I don\'t think I will respond to that question. </p><p>Q: In the 70s and early 80s when there was professionalism in </p><p>the military, soldiers interacted among themselves in the </p><p>officers\' messes.  Now the messes are deserted, ministers </p><p>don\'t honor functions in the mess.  What is responsible for </p><p>these developments? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: Let\'s get our understanding correct.  I will not say that </p><p>going to the mess is what constitutes professionalism in the </p><p>army.  Number two, I don\'t know how many messes you have been </p><p>to, that you can say with any degree of authority that </p><p>officers are not going to the mess.  Number three, it is not </p><p>all functions by the military that the minister has to </p><p>attend.  A lot of functions conducted by the army are not </p><p>even attended by the Chief of Staff or his principal staff </p><p>officers.  Let us not trivialize the issue of professionalism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: The present administration is keen on reprofessionalizing </p><p>the military and the best way to achieve that is to train and </p><p>retrain the military and equip it.  What special training is </p><p>the Army giving its men to keep them combat ready? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: From the day a young man enrolls in the Defense Academy </p><p>his career pattern is worked up to the time he will become a </p><p>General. Okay, there are a minimum number of courses he has </p><p>top attend. There are certain postings he must do, directing </p><p>staff in training institutions and command. And these </p><p>training facilities that have been allowed run down are now </p><p>being rehabilitated and upgraded and that is the difference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: There was a report that troops participating in the United </p><p>Nations Peace Keeping Mission are in low morale, especially </p><p>those from Ukraine, is the Nigerian troop having a similar </p><p>experience? What is the cause? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: I have been in Sierra Leone and I found the morale of our </p><p>officers and men very high. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: In relation to the ex-Biafran soldiers who are agitating </p><p>for absorption into the Nigerian Army, we don,t know what </p><p>your ministry is doing on that and what the implications are </p><p>for the Nigerian Army itself. What would happen if the army </p><p>wish to reabsorb them? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: You have just been asking me about "downsizing" the </p><p>Nigerian Army and now you are asking me to reverse gear and </p><p>go the another way. Let,s face it, the Biafran Army was </p><p>involved in treason. To fight your country or against your </p><p>country is treason, alright? These people were not staff of </p><p>the Nigerian Army, so how do you reabsorb them? Reabsorbing </p><p>means you were in before and you are being taken back. They </p><p>were never in before, so how can they be taken back? Unless </p><p>you are saying we should go and recruit the former Biafran </p><p>Army into he Nigerian Army. That,s a different ball game </p><p>altogether. They cannot talk of reabsorbtion because they </p><p>were never part of the Nigerian Army.  Biafra is not Nigeria, </p><p>Nigeria is Nigeria. So you can,t reabsorb soldiers from </p><p>another country into your own country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: The government has been talking about transparency in </p><p>public life for the nation to move forward/ What efforts are </p><p>the Army making to ensure that there is transparency in all </p><p>its activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: You see, transparency requires a number of things, but the </p><p>most fundamental is that there must be checks and balances ad </p><p>we are complying in the Nigerian Army with all the rules and </p><p>regulations. There was a retreat for the military in Kaduna </p><p>and Ibadan and we are going to go round to all the military </p><p>formations to do this retreat as part of the effort for the </p><p>campaign for transparency and accountability.  Also specific </p><p>programs are being worked out at different locations to deal </p><p>with these issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: At the retreat in Ibadan, the president called upon the </p><p>officers to open up so that government would tap from </p><p>whatever complaints they may have and find out how to satisfy </p><p>the rank and file of the military in terms of morale and so </p><p>on.  How was your experience in the course of the retreat? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: It was very beneficial, very educative and it was a good </p><p>training ground for me. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: What measure is the Nigerian Army taking, especially with </p><p>your leadership to ensure that the Army does not make any </p><p>incursion into politics? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: We have agreed that one of the best ways to keep any </p><p>mischief-maker in the military from making any incursion into </p><p>politics is basically good government and you will agree with </p><p>me that this government is providing that.  Two, the press </p><p>has always been involved in promoting extreme disharmony in </p><p>the society in a fundamentally negative fashion.  That </p><p>provides the military boys the excuse they are looking for. </p><p>So, the responsibility is not that of the government alone. </p><p>It is for all of us.  What do we say about ourselves if </p><p>mistakes are made, how do we approach the resolution of those </p><p>mistakes?  In 1983, some people were openly calling for the </p><p>military to take over.  The press was urging the military on. </p><p> In 1993 when Chief Shonekan was the Head of State, some </p><p>people were openly telling Sani Abacha to come and let the </p><p>military finish what they have started, hand over to, Abiola </p><p>and all that.  The Press and other influential members of </p><p>society can play their own part. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: Sir, would you support an Obasanjo/Atiku ticket come 2003? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: You don,t need to ask that question. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: For what reason sir? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: Look, let,s get it right.  First of all, why in the first </p><p>place do we support Obasanjo?  All the reasons that </p><p>recommended Obasanjo to be supported by all Nigerians are </p><p>still valid today, two years later.  Added to that, you will </p><p>testify there is greater hope in the Nigerian system.  In </p><p>1999, Niger Delta was a total no go area.  It affected the </p><p>important economic activities going on in Nigeria, especially </p><p>the exploration of oil.  The Niger Delta is peaceful today. </p><p>There is no vandalization of pipelines, no kidnapping of oil </p><p>workers, economic activities are picking up in the place and </p><p>express roads have been constructed.  Even in Abuja, today </p><p>there is relative security and there is calm all over the </p><p>country.  In the year 2000, the economy grew, for the first </p><p>time above the rate of population growth.  You can see </p><p>electricity supply stabilizing in Abuja and it is the same </p><p>all over.  In some par4ts of Lagos, especially the industrial </p><p>area, there is a continuous power supply for 22 hours </p><p>non-stop.  Proper lights, not the mini-mini lights (laughs). </p><p>The cost of food items has gone up since the inception of </p><p>this government and salaries have also gone up, so that </p><p>people could afford various items.  We should be happy about </p><p>that.  Out of your salary you can pay school fees </p><p>comfortably.  Most civil servants are even buying cars. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: (Cuts in) Tokunbo cars? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: Still, it is a car (laughs) no be car?  Is it not better </p><p>than walking over long distances?  There is qualitative </p><p>improvement in our lives in the past two years.  Some people </p><p>out of genuine ignorance have not articulated this.  Some do </p><p>so out of mischief, some out of dishonesty, but the truth of </p><p>the matter is that the achievements are there on the ground </p><p>for people to see.  We wish to extend the borders of peace on </p><p>the African continent.  That is very important, we should </p><p>never underestimate peace.  This government has brought </p><p>peace.  It has brought greater security for life and </p><p>property, and when you take all these together, you don,t </p><p>need to ask me whether I would support Obasanjo or not come </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: Finally sir, what legacies would you like to leave for the </p><p>Army? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: That is left for history to judge, not for me to say.  One </p><p>thing I would say is that I am prepared to give my best in </p><p>order to improve the situation beyond the level at which I </p><p>have met it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Q: What sort of Army would you like to leave behind? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A: The most efficient, the most effective and the most </p><p>respected Army in the world. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
