<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000706 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN\'S ELECTION ADMINISTRATION TECHNICALLY SOUND </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.   (U)  Summary:  Technical preparations for the April 27 </p><p>parliamentary elections are significantly better than past </p><p>efforts by the ROYG, which should increase citizen confidence </p><p>in the outcome of the elections.  Improvements include a more </p><p>credible voter registration, increased transparency, better </p><p>election materials, widespread voter education and </p><p>significant moves by the ROYG to alleviate opposition </p><p>concerns about undue influence.  An atmosphere of increased </p><p>political party competition, however, will offer challenges </p><p>for Yemen to continue its democratic progress and avoid </p><p>campaign violence (septel).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  According to the United Nations Development Program </p><p>(UNDP), National Democratic Institute for International </p><p>Affairs (NDI) and International Foundation for Electoral </p><p>Systems (IFES), the ROYG,s technical preparations for the </p><p>parliamentary elections are vastly improved over past </p><p>elections.   Past elections in 1997 (parliamentary) and 2001 </p><p>(local) were judged largely free and fair by international </p><p>organizations despite some problems, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- Technical inefficiency and lack of transparency and </p><p>communication on the part of the Supreme Election Commission </p><p>(SEC); </p><p> </p><p>-- Poor voter registration administration and adjudication </p><p>resulting in diminished confidence in the voter lists; </p><p> </p><p>-- Behind the scenes deals between political parties that </p><p>lessened citizen confidence in the election process; </p><p> </p><p>-- Few women candidates and a small number of registered </p><p>women voting; </p><p> </p><p>-- Ineffective voter education to create citizen </p><p>understanding of ballot secrecy and the importance of </p><p>exercising the right to vote. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Increased collaboration between the Supreme </p><p>Committee for Elections and Referenda (SCER, re-named from </p><p>the SEC) and the UNDP, IFES and NDI, as well as a strong </p><p>political will on the part of the ROYG, has resulted in </p><p>significant improvements in election administration for the </p><p>April 2003 elections.  Some of these improvements include: </p><p> </p><p>-- More credible voter registration in late 2002 resulting in </p><p>fraud-resistant voter ID cards, better record-keeping </p><p>(including computerized voter lists that allow for checking </p><p>for multiple registration), more than 8 million voters </p><p>registered and a 40% increase in the number of women </p><p>registered; </p><p> </p><p>-- Increased transparency on the part of the SCER to increase </p><p>confidence among political parties and citizens in the </p><p>process, including members drawn from across the political </p><p>spectrum, regularly televised open meetings, strong media </p><p>coverage, a willingness to openly admit problems and offer </p><p>solutions and close cooperation with international </p><p>organizations and donors; </p><p> </p><p>-- Better technical materials and procedures for voting day, </p><p>including fraud-resistant voter ID cards and ballots, </p><p>official registries with photos and tamper-resistant ink to </p><p>prevent double-voting; </p><p> </p><p>-- A confidence building measure by the SCER (advocated by </p><p>NDI) to alleviate accusations of strong military influence in </p><p>the election by placing decision-making to react to election </p><p>day disputes with a multiparty SCER committee (with a </p><p>military member) rather than solely with the military; </p><p> </p><p>--  Strengthened voter education programs that include using </p><p>all media outlets, training voter education coordinators to </p><p>conduct programs country-wide and establishing voter </p><p>education centers. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Several technical problems remain.  The provision in </p><p>the election law allowing citizens to vote at either their </p><p>place of residence, work or birth leaves an opening for </p><p>multiple voting that is difficult to counteract despite </p><p>improvements in voter registration record-keeping and better </p><p>indelible ink.  The increase in voting centers from past </p><p>elections allows greater access to citizens to vote.  At the </p><p>same time, however, the huge number of election commissions </p><p>(approximately 20,000 sub-commissions, one per 400 voters </p><p>registered) raises the possibility of increased fraud or </p><p>inadvertent mistakes on the part of individual commissioners </p><p>or sub-commissions.  With concerns about terrorism and </p><p>heightened tension in Yemen between political parties, the </p><p>military will maintain a strong presence.  Accusations by </p><p>opposition parties in past elections that the military played </p><p>an intimidating and sometimes fraudulent role could make the </p><p>security presence a campaign and election-day issue. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
