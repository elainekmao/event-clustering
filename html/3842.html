USMISSION/ROME HUMANITARIAN ATTACHE VISITED ETHIOPIA </p><p>SEPTEMBER 16-20, AND TRAVELED IN DROUGHT AFFECTED WOREDAS OF </p><p>EAST AND WEST HARARGE REGION. ASSESSMENTS OF THIS AREA, IN </p><p>ADDITION TO TIGRAY, WOLLO AND THE SOUTHERN REGION - SHOW A </p><p>SERIOUS EMERGENCY SITUATION DEVELOPING AS THE MAJOR (MEHER) </p><p>CROP RAINS DRAW TO A CLOSE. CROP LOSSES ARE WIDESPREAD, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN ETHIOPIA\'S MIDLANDS AND LOWLANDS IN THE </p><p>EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY AND THE SOUTH/SOUTHWEST AREAS. </p><p>MANY VULNERABLE GROUPS, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN, WILL REQUIRE </p><p>CONTINUING FOOD AND NON-FOOD SUPPORT TO MEET THEIR BASIC </p><p>NEEDS, PARTICULARLY IN 2003.

YES, </p><p>TO THE VERY END." </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. USMISSION/ROME HUMANITARIAN ATTACHE TIM LAVELLE VISITED </p><p>ETHIOPIA SEPTEMBER 16-20, 2002, AND TRAVELED WITH DISASTER </p><p>PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS (DPCC) COMMISSIONER SIMON </p><p>MECHALE, USAID ETHIOPIA\'S TIM SHORTLEY, AND WORLD FOOD </p><p>PROGRAM STAFF (THE TRIP\'S ABLE FACILITATOR) VIA VEHICLE AND </p><p>ETHIOPIAN ARMY-PROVIDED HELICOPTER THROUGH THE HIGHLANDS, </p><p>MIDLANDS AND LOWLANDS OF EAST AND WEST HARARGE, WHERE AN </p><p>ESTIMATED 2 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY AFFECTED THIS </p><p>YEAR BY SERIOUS DROUGHT (REF A). </p><p> </p><p>3. ETHIOPIA IS BIGGER THAN FRANCE AND SPAIN COMBINED, AND </p><p>WITH AROUND 65 MILLION, HAS THE THIRD LARGEST POPULATION IN </p><p>AFRICA. EIGHTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION LIVE IN RURAL </p><p>AREAS. ITS GDP PER CAPITA IS USD 100. A MAJOR FEATURE OF THE </p><p>CLIMATE IS THE UNRELIABLE NATURE OF THE RAINFALL. ETHIOPIA </p><p>SUFFERED TWO LARGE-SCALE, DROUGHT-INDUCED FAMINES IN RECENT </p><p>TIMES (1973/74 AND 1983/84), AND, THANKS TO MASSIVE DONOR </p><p>SUPPORT, SUCCESSFULLY AVERTED FAMINE IN 1999/2000. </p><p> </p><p>4. ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE COUNTRY\'S TRADITIONAL DROUGHT- </p><p>AFFECTED POPULATIONS LIVE IN THREE REGIONS: TIGRAY, WOLLO </p><p>AND HARARGE. SINCE THE 1983-84 FAMINE, ETHIOPIA HAS RECEIVED </p><p>AN ANNUAL AVERAGE LEVEL OF 700,000 MTS OF FOOD AID, WHICH </p><p>PRESENTLY MEETS APPROXIMATELY 15 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>FOOD NEEDS. AN ESTIMATED 4 TO 5 MILLION PEOPLE IN ETHIOPIA </p><p>REQUIRE RELIEF ASSISTANCE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR IRRESPECTIVE OF </p><p>CLIMATIC SHOCKS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04735  01 OF 03  301506Z </p><p> </p><p>5. IN EARLY 2002, THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT (GFDRE) APPEALED </p><p>FOR SOME 557,000 TONS OF FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR UP TO 5 MILLION </p><p>PERSONS WHO WERE ADJUDGED UNABLE TO MEET THEIR FOOD </p><p>CONSUMPTION REQUIREMENTS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE YEAR. </p><p>THROUGH MID-SEPTEMBER, THE TOTAL RESPONSE (INCLUDING A GFDRE </p><p>INPUT OF 45,000 TONS) EQUALED 392,000 TONS (70 PERCENT). </p><p>PRESENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT THE MAIN SEASON FOOD CROP </p><p>PRODUCTION WILL FALL BY A RANGE OF 8 TO 15 PERCENT AS </p><p>COMPARED TO THE LAST FOUR-YEAR AVERAGE. IT IS NOTED THAT THE </p><p>PRICE OF MAIZE (A BASIC STAPLE) HAS RISEN TO ADDIS ABABA BY </p><p>66 PERCENT OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>6. INDEPENDENT OF THE PRESENTLY UNFOLDING DROUGHT, 1998-2000 </p><p>WAR-INDUCED POPULATION DISPLACEMENTS, AND LIMITED PURCHASING </p><p>POWER IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, CONSIDER: </p><p> </p><p>-APPROXIMATELY ONE-FIFTH OF ETHIOPIAN CHILDREN DIE BEFORE </p><p>REACHING THEIR 5TH BIRTHDAY; </p><p> </p><p>-ETHIOPIA\'S AGROECOSYSTEMS ARE AFFLICTED BY CHRONIC </p><p>ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS.

DURING 1999/2000, ETHIOPIA EXPERIENCED PROBABLY THE WORST </p><p>DROUGHT SINCE 1983/84. TRADITIONAL COPING MECHANISMS WERE </p><p>ERODED; THE LOSS OF FARM ANIMALS IN PARTICULAR WAS VERY </p><p>HIGH, AND VIRTUALLY ENSURED THAT RECOVERY FROM THE 1999-2000 </p><p>DROUGHT WOULD BE LONG AND DIFFICULT. MOREOVER, A RECENT </p><p>STUDY OF RAINFALL OVER THE PAST 100 YEARS IN THE HORN OF </p><p>AFRICA HAS REVEALED THAT SERIOUS DROUGHTS OCCURRED ON </p><p>AVERAGE ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS. DURING THE PAST DECADE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE FREQUENCY OF WIDESPREAD DROUGHTS HAS </p><p>ACCELERATED TO ONCE EVERY 2-3 YEARS. GIVEN POOR HARVESTS </p><p>THROUGHOUT 2002 IN THE DROUGHT-PRONE PARTS OF ETHIOPIA, DPPC </p><p>HAS INCREASED ITS BENEFICIARY NUMBERS TO 7 MILLION FOR </p><p>SEPTEMBER AND THIS NUMBER COULD POSSIBLY ESCALATE TO A PEAK </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04735  02 OF 03  301506Z </p><p>OF 10 TO 14 MILLION IN THE "HUNGRY SEASON" BETWEEN FEBRUARY </p><p>AND JUNE, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. GFDRE AND DONORS WOULD BE BETTER SERVED TO TAKE INTO </p><p>ACCOUNT ETHIOPIA\'S STRUCTURAL FOOD DEFICIT (APPROXIMATELY </p><p>700,000 MTS) AND FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE NATIONAL CAPACITY TO </p><p>IMPORT FOOD ON TIME TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED.

THERE IS A COMPELLING NEED TO ADDRESS MORE DIRECTLY THE </p><p>PROBLEMS OF UNDER-NUTRITION IN INFANTS AND EXPECTANT </p><p>MOTHERS. UNLIKE OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA, ETHIOPIA HAS </p><p>NO PROGRAM THAT DELIVERS A COMBINATION OF SERVICES (FOOD </p><p>SUPPLEMENTS, MICRO-NUTRIENTS, HEALTH INPUTS, IMMUNIZATIONS, </p><p>ETC.) TARGETED TO THE MOST NUTRITIONALLY VULNERABLE GROUPS </p><p>IN THE POPULATION - INFANTS AND PREGNANT WOMEN. THIS IS AN </p><p>AREA WFP AND ITS UN AGENCIES PARTNERS MIGHT PROFITABLY </p><p>EXPLORE. </p><p> </p><p>14. THE LONG-TERM VALUE OF EDUCATION, PARTICULARLY FOR </p><p>GIRLS, TO IMPROVED NUTRITION FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS CANNOT </p><p>BE OVERSTATED. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE GLOBAL FOOD FOR </p><p>EDUCATION INITIATIVE SHOULD BE SYSTEMATICALLY RATCHETED UP. </p><p>WFP AND OTHER UN AGENCIES SHOULD AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE </p><p>ADDITIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND COMPLEMENTARY FUNDING TO COVER </p><p>NON-FOOD COSTS AND ENSURE HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION. </p><p> </p><p>15. THE RAPID SPREAD OF HIV/AIDS IS DANGEROUSLY UNDERMINING </p><p>DEVELOPMENTAL GAINS THROUGHOUT ETHIOPIA, INCREASINGLY </p><p>CAUSING SEVERE LABOR AND ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS THAT DIRECTLY </p><p>DISRUPT AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES.
