MONGOLIA </p><p>IS WILLING TO SHARE INTELLIGENCE AND COOPERATE IN ANY OTHER </p><p>WAY TO FIGHT TERRORISM.  MONGOLIA\'S MINISTRIES HAVE BEEN </p><p>SLOW IN WORKING WITH THE CENTRAL BANK TO DEVELOP THE </p><p>REGULATIONS AND TOOLS NECESSARY TO ENSURE NO TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION CAN USE MONGOLIA\'S FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND </p><p>TO ADEQUATELY SCRUTINIZE INTERNATIONAL BANKING </p><p>TRANSACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>B) NOT APPLICABLE. </p><p> </p><p>C) NOT APPLICABLE. </p><p> </p><p>D) THE UNITED STATES AND MONGOLIA HAVE NOT SIGNED AN </p><p>EXTRADITION TREATY. </p><p> </p><p>E) SEE A) ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>F) SEE A) ABOVE.

UNTIL SEPTEMBER 11, </p><p>2001 MOST MONGOLIAN OFFICIALS AND THE PUBLIC DID NOT </p><p>CONSIDER TERRORISM AN ISSUE OF CONCERN IN THIS RELATIVELY </p><p>COHESIVE, HOMOGENEOUS SOCIETY.  THE GOVERNMENT GAINED A </p><p>MORE URGENT PERCEPTION THAT MONGOLIA IS POTENTIALLY </p><p>SUSCEPTIBLE TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM FOLLOWING THE </p><p>HOSTAGE TAKING AT A THEATER IN MOSCOW EARLIER IN THE YEAR </p><p>AND IS REVIEWING ITS FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL SECURITY TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHERE THESE SYSTEMS NEED TO BE IMPROVED. </p><p> </p><p>J) NOT APPLICABLE. </p><p>K) NOT APPLICABLE. </p><p>L) NOT APPLICABLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DINGER </p><p></p></div>
