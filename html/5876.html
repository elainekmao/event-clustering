<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000382 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/PHD AND DRL/CRA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, ELAB, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: USG HUMAN RIGHTS STRATEGY IN NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 13790 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. With the unprecedented 2001 level of communal violence </p><p>and impending 2003 elections at all levels, in 2002 the U.S. </p><p>Mission operated several programs addressing the </p><p>institutional and legal shortcomings that lead to abuse of </p><p>human rights in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. USAID implemented a wide range of programs focusing on </p><p>more open and accountable government and greater citizen </p><p>participation in governance: U.S.-based NGOs and local civil </p><p>society groups worked with state and national legislatures to </p><p>improve legislative processes and increase opportunities for </p><p>citizen input.  Among the most notable results was a series </p><p>of state-level laws banning female genital mutilation and </p><p>other harmful traditional practices affecting women, as well </p><p>as a national law proscribing violence against women.  A </p><p>judicial strengthening program provided training, equipment </p><p>and expertise to three pilot courts to move cases more </p><p>quickly through improved case management and case tracking, </p><p>with the goals of reducing massive backlogs that lead to </p><p>lengthy pre-trial detentions and restoring confidence in the </p><p>judicial system in order to reduce recourse to extra-judicial </p><p>options for redress of grievances.  Extensive investment was </p><p>also made in training and technical assistance to improve the </p><p>capacity of election administration authorities to carry out </p><p>upcoming local and national elections, and to enhance </p><p>political parties, abilities to compete on issue-based </p><p>platforms, promote women,s participation and build better </p><p>communications with their grassroots affiliates.  USAID </p><p>programs also worked with a wide range of civil society </p><p>organizations, including advocacy training for women\'s groups </p><p>and assistance for other groups to address the numerous </p><p>communal and religious conflicts that have continued to occur. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. In addition, PAS, vigorous International Visitors, </p><p>Program, with input from several different sections within </p><p>the Mission, included representatives from NGOs, the host </p><p>government and civil society.  The visitors participated in a </p><p>wide range of programs, including conflict resolution, NGO </p><p>management, empowerment of women, trafficking issues, and </p><p>Islam in America. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. INL started a train-the-trainers program on police reform </p><p>in August, to improve the professionalism, responsibility and </p><p>performance of the Nigerian police force.  A major portion of </p><p>the program focused on respect for human rights, covering </p><p>such topics as excessive use of force and extra-judicial </p><p>killings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. MPRI, a contractor mostly funded by USG FMF with GON </p><p>contributions, has for the last three years assisted the </p><p>Nigerian military to restructure itself to be more responsive </p><p>to civil control and respect for human rights. ODC sponsored </p><p>two expanded IMET seminars, by the Center for Civil Military </p><p>Relations, and the Defense Institute of International Legal </p><p>Studies.  Both of these programs had time specifically </p><p>dedicated to the respect of human rights within a military </p><p>operation.  All the IMET students who attended training in </p><p>the United States were exposed to rule of law and human </p><p>rights issues as a part of their training curriculum. </p><p>Reports of military extra-judicial killings of civilians </p><p>while performing policing roles in 2002 declined greatly from </p><p>the previous year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The Mission,s political and economic sections regularly </p><p>met with local, state, and federal officials to discuss human </p><p>rights trends in policy-making and law enforcement, </p><p>particularly regarding respect for integrity of the person, </p><p>trafficking in persons, respect for civil liberties, refugees </p><p>and internally displaced persons.  They also worked closely </p><p>with many civic and international NGOs on such issues as </p><p>worker rights, religious freedom, prison conditions, and </p><p>women, children\'s, and minorities\' rights.  The Embassy </p><p>funded Democracy and Human Rights Fund projects totaling </p><p>$60,000 on the issues of eradication of female genital </p><p>mutilation and reduction of corruption in the government. </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
