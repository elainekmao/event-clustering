<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 001030 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER; PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 4/2/07 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, KWMN, IR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAN--RAFSANJANI FAMILY, WOMEN IN THE MAJLES. </p><p>PART THREE IN A SERIES. </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ISTANBUL 770  B) ISTANBUL 960 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   CONFIDENTIAL.  CLASSIFIED BY CONS THOMAS H. CARTER </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5.(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  THE FAMILY OF ALI AKBAR HASHEMI </p><p>RAFSANJANI, ESPECIALLY HIS DAUGHTER FAEZEH, WILL REMAIN </p><p>POWERFUL DESPITE RAFSANJANI\'S IMMINENT RETIREMENT, SAYS </p><p>AN IRANIAN BUSINESSMAN.  AZAN TALEGHANI, DAUGHTER OF THE </p><p>LATE AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI, ADDS THAT FEMALE </p><p>REPRESENTATION IN THE MAJLES IS INCREASING BUT IRANIAN </p><p>WOMEN HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING WORK IN ANY FIELD OTHER </p><p>THAN TEACHING.  ADVOCACY GROUPS SUCH THE ISLAMIC WOMEN\'S </p><p>INSTITITUTE OF IRAN, OF WHICH MS. TALEGHANI IS </p><p>PRESIDENT, HELP FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS AND PROFESSIONALS </p><p>FIND JOBS.  THIS REPORT IS THE THIRD IN A SERIES. </p><p>REFTELS A AND B DEALT WITH THE US EMBARGO, IRANIAN </p><p>RELIGIOUS FOUNDATIONS, AND THE SEPARATION OF MOSQUE AND </p><p>STATE IN IRAN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>FAEZEH RAFSANJANI WANTS TO BE SPEAKER </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IF CURRENT MAJLES SPEAKER NATEQ-NURI WINS THE </p><p>NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AS EXPECTED, RAFSANJANI\'S </p><p>OLDEST CHILD FAEZEH MAY BECOME SPEAKER OF THE MAJLES OR </p><p>A PRESIDENTIAL DEPUTY.  SOURCE, A MULTI-LINGUAL AND </p><p>HIGHLY EDUCATED IRANIAN BUSINESSMAN, HAS A FRIEND WHO </p><p>PLAYS VOLLEYBALL FOR THE IRANIAN NATIONAL TEAM AND WHO </p><p>ATTENDED A DINNER IN JANUARY AT WHICH FAEZEH SPOKE. </p><p>(NOTE: FAEZEH IS CURRENTLY THE HEAD OF THE IRANIAN </p><p>ATHLETIC FEDERATION.)  FAEZEH TOLD THE ASSEMBLY THAT SHE </p><p>WOULD WORK HARD AS SPEAKER OF THE MAJLES TO OPEN DOORS </p><p>TO THE WEST SO THAT ATHLETES COULD COMPETE </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY. SHE ALSO MENTIONED THAT SHE WOULD </p><p>REPRESENT HER FATHER IN THE POLITICAL ARENA AND THAT SHE </p><p>WOULD CARRY ON HIS FIGHT TO MODERNIZE IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  FAEZEH\'S STATEMENTS MAKE CLEAR HER </p><p>SYMPATHY WITH PRAGMATISTS IN THE MAJLES.  DURING LAST </p><p>YEAR\'S ELECTION SEASON FAEZEH MADE SEVERAL CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>STATEMENTS SUCH AS HER BELIEF THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE </p><p>TO RIDE BICYCLES FREELY IN TEHRAN PARKS.  SHORTLY AFTER </p><p>THE ELECTIONS THE CONSERVATIVE COALITION LED BY KHAMANEI </p><p>CONSOLIDATED POWER AND FAEZEH BECAME MUCH LESS VOCAL-- </p><p>OUR SOURCES CLAIM SHE FEARED DECERTIFICATION.  HER </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK OUT AGAIN SIGNALS EITHER HER </p><p>GROWING CONFIDENCE, THE GROWING CONFIDENCE OF THE HARD- </p><p>LINERS THAT THEY ARE FIRMLY IN POWER AND NOT THREATENED </p><p>BY FAEZEH, OR BOTH.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>FAEZEH\'S GENDER NOT IMPORTANT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SOURCE SAYS FAEZEH\'S GENDER IS NOT AN ISSUE </p><p>BECAUSE SHE IS A RAFSANJANI AND BECAUSE OF HER STRONG </p><p>PERSONALITY.  THE MAJLES HAS A GROWING CONTINGENT OF </p><p>FEMALE REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING FARZANI MAYED OF </p><p>ISFAHAN AND FARZANI MAJOUB OF TEHRAN.  MAHJOUB IS A </p><p>PRAGMATIST AND THE DAUGHTER OF DR. (FNU) MAHJOUB, FORMER </p><p>MINISTER OF EDUCATION UNDER THE SHAH.  SOURCE BELIEVES </p><p>WOMEN WERE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION </p><p>BUT WERE SHORTCHANGED BY KHOMEINI AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN </p><p>GIVEN PROPER CREDIT OR AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  REGARDING FAEZEH BECOMING SPEAKER, </p><p>SOURCE\'S LENSES MAY BE A BIT ROSE-COLORED.  A SURVEY OF </p><p>OTHER IRANIANS COMING THROUGH ISTANBUL PRODUCED ONLY </p><p>OPINIONS TO THE CONTRARY.  ONE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>EMPLOYEE SAID A WOMAN COULD NEVER ACHIEVE A LEADERSHIP </p><p>POSITION IN IRAN.  EVEN NOW THERE IS DISAGREEMENT ON THE </p><p>TALLY OF FAEZEH\'S ELECTION RESULTS FROM LAST SPRING. </p><p>LIBERAL SOURCES SAY SHE RECEIVED THE MOST VOTES OF ANY </p><p>CANDIDATE AND WOULD BE SPEAKER BUT FOR THE FACT THAT SHE </p><p>IS A WOMAN.  MEANWHILE TWO OF THE MAJOR IRANIAN DAILIES </p><p>CLAIMED SHE RECEIVED THE SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES, </p><p>AND SEVERAL CONSERVATIVE SOURCES CLAIM SHE SIMPLY </p><p>RECEIVED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES OF ANY FEMALE </p><p>CANDIDATE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>OTHER RAFSANJANI CHILDREN COMING INTO THEIR OWN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI WILL REMAIN POWERFUL AFTER </p><p>HIS RETIREMENT IN AUGUST, SOURCE SAYS, THANKS TO THE </p><p>GROWING WEALTH AND INFLUENCE OF HIS FAMILY.  IN ADDITION </p><p>TO FAEZEH, THE PRESIDENT HAS TWO OTHER CHILDREN. </p><p>RAFSANJANI\'S SECOND CHILD, YASSER, CONTROLS THE IMPORTS </p><p>OF MANY MAJOR EAST ASIAN COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN </p><p>IRAN AND IS SAID TO HAVE POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS; HIS </p><p>OTHER SON, MEHDI, IS DOING WELL AS THE HEAD OF A </p><p>BUSINESS GROUP WHICH HAS TIES TO GERMAN, CANADIAN, AND </p><p>JAPANESE FIRMS.  SOURCE CLAIMS THE RAFSANJANI FAMILY </p><p>OWNS MOST OF RAFSANJAN--AN IMPORTANT PISTACHIO-GROWING </p><p>TOWN AND REGION--AND PRODUCES "RAFSANJAN PISTACHIOS" </p><p>WHICH ACCOUNT FOR NINETY PERCENT OF ALL PISTACHIO </p><p>EXPORTS FROM IRAN.  HE ADDS THAT THE FAMILY ALSO </p><p>CONTROLS THE PROFITABLE "FREE-TRADE ZONE" ON QESHM </p><p>ISLAND IN THE PERSIAN GULF. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  SOURCE VIEWS THE WEALTH OF THE </p><p>RAFSANJANI FAMILY IN A FAVORABLE LIGHT, BUT OTHER </p><p>IRANIANS ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF CORRUPTION AND </p><p>NEPOTISM.  THE CONTROL OVER THE RAFSANJAN PISTACHIO </p><p>BUSINESS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY OTHER SOURCES, ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE NINETY PERCENT FIGURE MAY BE HIGH.  RAFSANJANI\'S </p><p>CONTROL OVER THE QESHM FREE ZONE IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE. </p><p>IN ANY CASE, THE RAFSANJANI FAMILY IS ASSURED OF A LARGE </p><p>AND STEADY INCOME FROM THEIR BROADENING VENTURES.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI\'S DAUGHTER GIVES INPUT </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IN EARLY MARCH AZAN TALEGHANI, PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC WOMEN\'S INSTITUTE OF IRAN, CAME THROUGH ISTANBUL </p><p>ON HER WAY TO A UN CONFERENCE IN NY.  MS. TALEGHANI IS </p><p>THE DAUGHTER OF THE LATE AYATOLLAH MAHMOUD TALEGHANI, A </p><p>PIVOTAL FIGURE IN THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MS. TALEGHANI THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN POLITICS IS </p><p>GROWING.  DURING THE SHAH\'S TIME THERE WERE NEVER MORE </p><p>THAN FOUR WOMEN IN PARLIAMENT, NOR DID THE NUMBER RISE </p><p>AFTER THE REVOLUTION.  FOLLOWING THE 1992 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS, HOWEVER, NINE FEMALE MEMBERS WON POSITIONS IN </p><p>THE MAJLES.  FOUR MORE WERE ELECTED IN THE 1996 </p><p>ELECTIONS, BRINGING THE TOTAL TO THIRTEEN.  TALEGHANI </p><p>SAYS FOUR OF THE THIRTEEN WOMEN IN THE MAJLES ARE </p><p>LIBERAL/PRAGMATISTS, THREE ARE CONSERVATIVES, AND THE </p><p>OTHER SIX DO NOT HAVE CLEAR AFFILIATIONS.  SEVERAL </p><p>FEMALE LIBERAL CANDIDATES WERE NOT CERTIFIED BY THE </p><p>COUNCIL OF GUARDIANS IN THE LAST ELECTIONS OR THE NUMBER </p><p>COULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) MS. TALEGHANI SAYS THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM </p><p>WOMEN FACE IN IRAN IS THE INABLITY TO ENTER THE WORK </p><p>FORCE.  THE PRIMARY TASK OF HER ORGANIZATION IS TO GET </p><p>WOMEN INTO WELL-PAYING JOBS.  THE ORGANIZATION\'S MOST </p><p>SUCCESSFUL VENTURE SO FAR IS A TEXTILE COOPERATIVE, </p><p>MANAGED AND STAFFED BY WOMEN, WHICH MAKES CLOTHING FOR </p><p>EXPORT TO DUBAI.  SUCH SUCCESS IS RARE IN IRAN, SAYS </p><p>TALEGHANI, AND MOST WOMEN WHO WORK ARE TEACHERS. MORE </p><p>YOUNG WOMEN THAN EVER BEFORE ARE RECEIVING SECONDARY AND </p><p>HIGHER EDUCATION, BUT OUTSIDE OF TEACHING THERE ARE FEW </p><p>PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN.  MS. TALEGHANI WAS </p><p>A TEACHER FOR MANY YEARS AND ACTUALLY HAD FAEZEH </p><p>RAFSANJANI AS A STUDENT.  TALEGHANI SAYS FAEZEH WAS "NOT </p><p>A REMARKABLE STUDENT," BUT IS PLEASED WITH HER </p><p>POLITICAL SUCCESS AND WITH THE PROGRESS THIS REPRESENTS </p><p>FOR IRANIAN WOMEN. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) NOTE:  SOURCE\'S FATHER--AYATOLLAH MAHMOUD </p><p>TALEGHANI--WAS A UNIVERSITY TEACHER AND LEFTIST ISLAMIC </p><p>THEORIST PERSECUTED THROUGHOUT THE SHAH\'S REGIME.  HIS </p><p>FAMILY HAD DEEP ROOTS AMONG THE BAZAARI (MERCHANT CLASS) </p><p>IN TEHRAN, AND MAINTAINS EVEN NOW SOME OF ITS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE.  ACCORDING TO JOHN STEMPEL\'S </p><p>"INSIDE THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION" TALEGHANI "...WAS </p><p>IDOLIZED BY THE URBAN POOR AND BY THE YOUNG </p><p>INTELLECTUALS IN BOTH MUJAHADIN AND FEDAYEEN CIRCLES FOR </p><p>HIS OPPOSITION TO THE SHAH....  HE WAS THE ONLY </p><p>INDIVIDUAL [AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTION] WHOSE </p><p>PERSONAL REPUTATION WAS IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH TO DEFY </p><p>KHOMEINI."  A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI </p><p>AND AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI THREATENED THE REVOLUTION AND </p><p>COULD HAVE RESULTED IN CIVIL WAR, BUT TALEGHANI </p><p>EVENTUALLY CONCEDED TO KHOMEINI FOR THE SAKE OF UNITY. </p><p>HE DIED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HUGGINS </p><p></p></div>
