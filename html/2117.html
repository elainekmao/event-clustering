(C) SUMMARY.  THE OCTOBER 25 TO 27 VISIT BY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF SEVEN COMMONWEALTH (CW) COUNTRIES AND </p><p>THE CW SECRETARY-GENERAL REVIEWED PROGRESS ON </p><p>COMMITMENTS AGREED TO BY THE GOZ ON LAND REFORM, RULE OF </p><p>LAW, AND ATTENDANT ISSUES AS OUTLINED IN THE ABUJA </p><p>AGREEMENT OF SEPTEMBER 6 (REFTEL).  OUR GLEANINGS FROM </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS, AND SPECIFICALLY HARARE BASED CW </p><p>DIPLOMATS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE VISIT, REVEAL GENERAL </p><p>SKEPTICISM AMONG THE CW DELEGATION THAT THE GOZ HAS </p><p>HONORED ITS ABUJA COMMITMENTS.  GOZ ATTEMPTS TO STAGE- </p><p>MANGE THE VISIT DID NOT SUCCEED, AND THE CW COMMITTEE </p><p>HEARD THE VIEWS OF A BROAD RANGE OF ZIMBABWEANS.  THE </p><p>VISIT HAD SEVERAL CONTENTIOUS MOMENTS, THE WORST DURING </p><p>DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE FINAL COMMUNIQUE.  THE </p><p>COMPROMISE RESULTED IN A DOCUMENT THAT PLEASED NO ONE </p><p>BUT ALLOWED BOTH SIDES TO CLAIM SOME DEGREE OF SUCCESS </p><p>AND THUS KEEP THE ABUJA PROCESS ALIVE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR THE CW INCLUDE CONTINUING </p><p>THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GOZ AND VISIBLE ENGAGEMENT OF ITS </p><p>OPPONENTS, RULE OF LAW ISSUES STILL ON THE AGENDA, AND </p><p>AGREEMENT TO AN IMPENDING UNDP ASSESSMENT OF LAND REFORM </p><p>AS A MEANS OF MONITORING ABUJA COMPLIANCE.  FOR ITS </p><p>PART, THE GOZ AVOIDED FURTHER ISOLATION FROM THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, RESISTED EFFORTS TO PIN IT DOWN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03240  01 OF 04  291644Z </p><p>ON POLITICAL/ELECTORAL ISSUES, AND MAINTAINED ITS </p><p>DUBIOUS INTERPRETATION THAT THE GOZ OWNS LAND ONCE THE </p><p>LAND IS LISTED AND THEREFORE IS OPERATING WITHIN THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW.  FROM THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE, THE THREE-DAY </p><p>WALTZ AROUND ABUJA FELL SHORT IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE CRUCIAL ISSUE OF ELECTION OBSERVATION.  WE </p><p>RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT FOLLOW UP WITH NIGERIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT OBASANJO, THE GODFATHER OF THE ABUJA </p><p>AGREEMENT, IN WASHINGTON THIS WEEK ABOUT OUR CONCERNS </p><p>THAT ILLEGAL LAND INVASIONS, VIOLENCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>VIOLATIONS, AND A VIABLE ELECTORAL ENVIRONMENT HAVE NOT </p><p>BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>INSIDERS\' VIEWS OF ABUJA II </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CANADIAN DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER RON WILLSON </p><p>AND UK COUNTERPART DIANNE CORNER DEBRIEFED G-8 DEPUTIES </p><p>OCTOBER 29 ON THE ABUJA II MEETING IN HARARE.  THEY </p><p>DESCRIBED A DISORGANIZED AND SOMETIMES CONTENTIOUS </p><p>VISIT.  WILLSON, WHO ADMITTED THAT CANADIAN DEPUTY </p><p>MINISTER KILGOUR HAD TAKEN THE HARDEST LINE WITH GOZ, </p><p>TERMED THE MEETING "NOT A RESOUNDING SUCCESS" WITH </p><p>"MINIMAL RESULTS," A CHARACTERIZATION THAT CORNER </p><p>SECONDED.  WILLSON SAID THAT THE VISIT ALMOST FOUNDERED </p><p>IN ITS FINAL STAGES WHEN THERE WAS A NEAR BREAKDOWN ON </p><p>THE NEGOTIATED COMMUNIQUE OVER SEVERAL ISSUES.  AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THIS THE CW DID NOT GET THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>-- A MENTION IN THE COMMUNIQUE OF ELECTIONS OBSERVERS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03240  01 OF 04  291644Z </p><p>AGAINST WHICH THE GOZ SIDE ARGUED OVER THE ISSUE OF </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY. </p><p> </p><p>-- AN INVITATION FROM THE GOZ FOR CW ELECTION OBSERVERS, </p><p>AS REQUIRED IN CW GUIDELINES.  THE GOZ SIDE DECLINED A </p><p>SUGGESTION THAT THE GOZ "ASK THE CW TO REQUEST THE GOZ </p><p>TO PERMIT CW PARTICIPATION." </p><p> </p><p>-- NO CW MONITORING MECHANISM WAS AGREED, LEAVING ABUJA </p><p>FOLLOW UP AT THE CW MINISTERIAL LEVEL, WHERE THE GOZ </p><p>APPEARS TO PREFER IT, ALTHOUGH A NOVEMBER 14 UNDP </p><p>MISSION WAS AGREED TO "HELP THE GOZ TO FULLY COMPLY" </p><p>WITH ABUJA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WILLSON NOTED THAT THERE IS POSSIBLE FUTURE </p><p>MOVEMENT ON SOME OF THESE POINTS.  LEGAL AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER CHINAMASA HAD INFORMED THE CW DELEGATION THAT </p><p>HE WOULD BE PRESENTING TO THE CABINET WITHIN THREE WEEKS </p><p>A POLICY PAPER THAT WOULD DEFINE THE ROLES OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS AND DOMESTIC ELECTION </p><p>MONITORS.

(WILLSON </p><p>ADDED IN AN ASIDE THAT THE NEW CANADIAN HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER TO ABUJA HAD RAISED THE ISSUE OF CW </p><p>OBSERVERS FOR ZIMBABWE WITH OBASANJO LAST WEEK DURING </p><p>THE PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS.  OBASANJO REPLIED THAT </p><p>HE HAD RECENTLY SPOKEN TO MUGABE, WHO HAD TOLD HIM THAT </p><p>HE DID NOT WANT INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS BUT MIGHT </p><p>CONSIDER A COMMONWEALTH OBSERVATION INITIATIVE.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) CORNER NOTED THAT THE CW HAD ALSO PREVAILED ON </p><p>SEVERAL POINTS.  COINCIDENT WITH THE CW VISIT, THE GOZ </p><p>HAD AGREED TO AN ASSESSMENT VISIT BY A UNDP TEAM THAT </p><p>WOULD EXAMINE THE LAND REFORM SITUATION ON THE GROUND. </p><p>IN A MEETING WITH THE CW DELEGATION, UNDP RESREP VICTOR </p><p>ANGELO HAD AGREED THAT UNDP WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE </p><p>MONITORING MECHANISM FOR THE ABUJA AGREEMENT (IN LIEU OF </p><p>A CW MECHANISM) THAT WOULD LOOK AT ALL ASPECTS OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENT, NOT SIMPLY LAND REFORM.  CORNER CAUTIONED </p><p>THAT (TO THE BEST OF HER KNOWLEDGE) THE GOZ AND UNDP HAD </p><p>NOT YET MUTUALLY AGREED UPON TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE </p><p>ASSESSMENT.  (ANGELO INFORMED THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE </p><p>ASSESSMENT TEAM WILL ARRIVE ON NOVEMBER 14.)  CORNER </p><p>ADDED THAT DESPITE INITIAL GOZ ATTEMPT TO PACK THE </p><p>SCHEDULE WITH ITS SUPPORTERS, THE CW DELEGATION HAD </p><p>ULTIMATELY MET WITH AND HEARD THE CONCERNS OF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF CIVIL SOCIETY, INDEPENDENT </p><p>JOURNALISTS, AND OTHER NON-GOVERNMENTAL GROUPS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03240  02 OF 04  291644Z </p><p> </p><p>6.

(C) CORNER AND WILLSON OBSERVED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SOUGHT TO MANIPULATE THE PROGRAM BY MONOPOLIZING THE </p><p>GROUP\'S TIME AND THROUGH PURPOSEFUL DISORGANIZATION OF </p><p>THE ENTIRE EVENT.  THE MFA DID NOT PRESENT THE CW </p><p>EMBASSIES INVOLVED A PROPOSED SCHEDULE OF MEETINGS UNTIL </p><p>WEDNESDAY EVENING, JUST BEFORE INITIAL CALLS ON GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS WERE TO BEGIN.

(C) WILLSON DESCRIBED A SECOND GOZ COMPROMISE ON </p><p>SITE VISITS TO FARMS OUTSIDE OF HARARE.  THE INITIAL GOZ </p><p>PLAN TO HELICOPTER ONLY THE HEADS OF VISITING </p><p>DELEGATIONS TO FARMS OF THE GOZ\'S CHOICE WAS ALTERED TO </p><p>ALLOW A VISIT BY HEADS OF DELEGATION TO ONE FARM OF GOZ </p><p>CHOICE AND A SECOND CHOSEN BY THE CW COMMITTEE ITSELF. </p><p>WILLSON SAID THAT THE VISIT TO THE FIRST FARM IN </p><p>MASVINGO WAS PROBABLY INTENDED BY THE GOZ TO SHOWCASE </p><p>PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE BETWEEN COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND </p><p>THOSE RESETTLED FROM COMMUNAL LANDS.  THE FARMER IN </p><p>QUESTION, DESCRIBED BY HIS NEIGHBORS AS A GENTLE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL OVERWHELMED BY THE OCCUPATION AND DESTRUCTION </p><p>OF HIS FARM, HAD REPORTEDLY BEEN WARNED IN ADVANCE BY </p><p>THE GOZ TO TAKE A SOFT LINE.  HE DID, BUT THEN ASKED TO </p><p>YIELD THE FLOOR TO A NEIGHBOR CHOSEN AS SPOKESMAN BY THE </p><p>LOCAL COMMERCIAL FARMER COMMUNITY.  MUDENGE AND LANDS </p><p>MINISTER MADE OBJECTED STRONGLY TO THIS, LEADING TO AN </p><p>EXCHANGE WITH CANADIAN DEPUTY MINISTER KILGOUR AND </p><p>PLACING NIGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER LAMIDO, CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>THE CW COMMITTEE, IN AN AWKWARD SPOT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IF POSSIBLE, WILLSON RELATED, THE SECOND FARM </p><p>ISIT WAS EVEN WORSE FROM THE GOZ PERSPECTIVE.  WHEN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03240  03 OF 04  291644Z </p><p>CW HEADS OF DELEGATION FINALLY HELICOPTERED IN, OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN THERE FOR </p><p>TWO HOURS.  THEY HAD ALREADY TOURED THE BURNT-OUT HOUSES </p><p>OF FARM WORKERS, VISITED THE VANDALIZED HOME OF A FARM </p><p>FAMILY NOW LIVING IN HARARE, AND HEARD THE RESETTLED </p><p>FARMER OCCUPIERS ADMIT THAT TWO OF THEIR NUMBERS </p><p>REPORTEDLY KILLED DURING THE TAKEOVER HAD ACTUALLY </p><p>PERISHED WHEN THEY ROLLED OVER A PURLOINED TRACTOR.  UK </p><p>JUNIOR MINISTER BARONESS AMOS SUMMED UP THE VISIT BY </p><p>STATING THAT SHE FOUND IT STRANGE THAT 82 SETTLERS HAD </p><p>DISPLACED 265 FARM WORKERS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) WILLSON SAID THAT THE FARM VISITS HAD REVEALED </p><p>THE STARTLING FACT THAT THE GOZ BELIEVES THAT FARMS </p><p>GAZETTED UNDER SECTION 5 OF THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PLAN COME UNDER IMMEDIATE GOZ OWNERSHIP.  IN RESPONSE, </p><p>THE CANADIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER READ DIRECTLY FROM A GOZ </p><p>POLICY DOCUMENT DESCRIBING THE LAND REFORM PLAN THAT </p><p>STATES: "RESETTLEMENT CANNOT TAKE PLACE AFTER A SECTION </p><p>5 ORDER."  MUDENGE AND MADE INSISTED THAT THIS LANGUAGE </p><p>IS MINISTRY OF INFORMATION PHRASEOLOGY AND HAS NO LEGAL </p><p>STANDING. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>NO CW DIVISION, BUT A WEAK COMMUNIQUE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) CORNER DISCOUNTED PRESS REPORTS IN THE GOZ </p><p>MEDIA THAT THE CW DELEGATION HAD SPLIT ALONG </p><p>AFRICAN/NON-AFRICAN LINES.

DESPITE THIS, NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE </p><p>COMMUNIQUE HAD REVEALED A GENERALLY UNITED FRONT, WITH </p><p>THE CW DELEGATES PUSHING THE ZIMBABWEANS ON ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVATION, LAWFUL LAND REFORM AND SIMILAR POINTS. </p><p>WILLSON OBSERVED THAT THE NIGERIANS, WHO HAD THE MOST </p><p>FACE TO LOSE IF THE VISIT FAILED, HAD SUBMITTED AN </p><p>INITIAL COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS TOO SOFT AND SEEMED TO </p><p>RATCHET BACK REQUIRED GOZ ACTIONS AS AGREED TO AT THE </p><p>ABUJA MEETING.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THE FINAL COMMUNIQUE </p><p>WAS SOMEWHAT STRONGER, BUT NOT TO THE POINT THAT THE GOZ </p><p>HAD REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TEXT.  THE CANADIAN AND </p><p>BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONERS WERE SATISFIED THAT THE </p><p>COMMUNIQUE HAD HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCES OVER </p><p>WHAT IS RULE OF LAW WITH RESPECT TO LAND OCCUPATION </p><p>ISSUES, ALTHOUGH NO RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES WAS </p><p>REACHED. </p><p> </p><p>12.
