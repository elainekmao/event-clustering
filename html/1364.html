<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 005449 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA, S/CT AND P </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/24/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: SALEH CITES USN CULPABILITY IN THE USS COLE ATTACK </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 5425 (NOTAL) </p><p>     B. SANAA 5443 </p><p>     C. SANAA 5439 </p><p>     D. SANAA 5430 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR BARBARA K. BODINE.  REASONS 1.5 </p><p>B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  IN HIS MBC INTERVIEW EARLIER THIS WEEK, YEMENI </p><p>PRESIDENT SALEH STATED THAT "THE AMERICANS MADE A GROSS </p><p>MISTAKE WHEN THEY MOVED SUCH A HUGE SHIP (THE USS COLE) INTO </p><p>ADEN HARBOR WITHOUT PROVIDING SUFFICIENT </p><p>PROTECTION....WITHOUT (YEMENI) PROTECTIVE VESSELS GOING IN </p><p>WITH IT.  THEY DID NOT ASK FOR OUR PROTECTION AND THIS IS A </p><p>MISTAKE, A GROSS MILITARY MISTAKE."  THE PRESIDENT STATED </p><p>VIRTULLY THE EXACT SAME THING TO THE AMBASSADOR ON NOVEMBER </p><p>21 (OTHER SUBJECTS SEPTELS). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR REJOINED THAT IT WAS HIGHLY DISTASTEFUL </p><p>THAT THE USS COLE WOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK IT </p><p>SUFFERED.  SHE PRESUMED THAT THE MISINFORMATION THE PRESIDENT </p><p>HAD BEEN PROVIDED ON THIS SCORE WAS PROVIDED BY THE SAME </p><p>"SENIOR ADVISOR" WHO INFORMED HIM THE EXPLOSION WAS AN </p><p>INTERNAL ACCIDENT (I.E., THE COMMANDER OF THE NAVY IN ADEN, </p><p>GENERAL IBRAHIM).  SHE ALSO REMINDED THE PRESIDENT THAT IT </p><p>WAS YEMEN\'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. </p><p>THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING WE NEED REQUEST. IT WAS TO BE </p><p>EXPECTED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  SHE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT, CONTRARY TO A FOLLOW-UP </p><p>POINT BY THE PRESIDENT, THE YEMEN NAVY WAS AWARE OF THE BSF. </p><p>THE ROYG WAS INFORMED IN A PROPER AND TIMELY MANNER, AS WELL </p><p>AS APPROPRIATE PORT AUTHORITIES.  "DIDN\'T KNOW" WAS NOT AN </p><p>ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE BY THE YEMEN NAVY.  SALEH CONCEDED THAT </p><p>MAYBE YEMENI INTERAGENCY COMMUNICATIONS WAS NOT ALWAYS GOOD </p><p>AND THAT THE NAVY\'S ARGUMENT WAS NOT TERRIBLY CREDIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  WE ARE QUITE SURE THIS TRASH WAS DELIVERED </p><p>BY THE NAVAL COMMANDER, PROBABLY IN DEFENSE FROM A </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL QUERY AS TO WHY HE HAD NOT TAKEN THE NECESSARY </p><p>PRECAUTIONS. THE COMMANDER IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PURVEYOR OF THE </p><p>INTERNAL EXPLOSION THEORY AND IS WELL-KNOWN FOR BEING BOTH </p><p>INCOMPETENT AND VENAL.  ONE FACTOR IN A RECENT FRENCH </p><p>DECISION TO CANCEL A PLANNED PORT VISIT IN ADEN WAS A </p><p>$1000.00 "SHAKEDOWN" FROM THE COMMANDER.  THE YEMEN NAVY AT </p><p>ONE POINT ATTEMPTED TO CHARGE THE USN A $500 "ESCORT </p><p>SERVICES" FEE, A SERVICE NEITHER REQUESTED NOR NEEDED. WHEN </p><p>RAISED WITH THE SOUTHERN AREA COMMANDER, THESE FEES STOPPED. </p><p>IT WAS ALSO OBVIOUS TO BOTH US AND TO SENIOR MILITARY </p><p>OFFICIALS IN ADEN SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK, SPECIALLY </p><p>GENERALS ALAYWAH AND MAGWALLAH, THAT THE YEMEN NAVY HAD NO </p><p>CONCEPT OF HOW TO SET UP PICKET SHIPS. THE DRESSING DOWN THE </p><p>COMMANDER RECEIVED FROM THE TWO GENERALS PORT SIDE AND IN </p><p>FRONT OF A SENIOR AMERICAN DELEGATION WAS DEVASTATING. WE </p><p>SUSPECT THE COMMANDER IS STILL SCRAMBLING TO SAVE HIS JOB. </p><p> </p><p>BODINE </p><p></p></div>
