<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001871 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, PHUM, PGOV, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW REPORTS OF FARM EVICTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. (SBU) Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) president David </p><p>Hasluck called on Friday, August 16, to confirm several cases </p><p>of farm eviction throughout the country.  While the overall </p><p>situation remains tense but superficially calm, there are </p><p>scattered instances of official response to the farmers\' </p><p>refusal to recognize the GOZ\'s section 8 ultimatums. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In Matebeleland South, six farmers -- including the </p><p>CFU president for that region --  have reportedly received </p><p>summonses to report to the local police station and clarify </p><p>why they have not yet moved out of their homesteads.  Five of </p><p>the farmers are cattle ranchers, and one has a crop in the </p><p>ground.  All of the six farmers have received section 8 </p><p>notices of compulsory acquisition, and all six have refused </p><p>to move off their farms.  According to Hasluck, all of the </p><p>farmers were released on bail of Zim $5,000 each (equivalent </p><p>to US $7.25 at the parallel rate) and remanded to September 6 </p><p>for further proceedings. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In Mashonaland Central, the police have reportedly </p><p>been told that they are to begin evicting farmers from their </p><p>land, although the police have not yet begun to follow this </p><p>directive.  It is unclear where this directive has originated. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) In Kwekwe, one farmer who has a 400 hectare crop of </p><p>barley growing was forcibly evicted on Thursday by settlers </p><p>on the farm.  Although this was a settler-led action, the </p><p>police were reportedly standing by and observing without </p><p>offering assistance to the farmer.  The farmer was allowed to </p><p>return on Friday to tend his crop.  Hasluck is attempting to </p><p>contact the provincial governor, who in response to the food </p><p>shortage had previously given permission for this farmer to </p><p>plant his crop and had orally assured the farmer that he </p><p>would be allowed to harvest.  Hasluck hopes that an audience </p><p>with the governor will rectify the situation, but the </p><p>governor is currently unavailable and his whereabouts are </p><p>unknown. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment:  Hasluck remains mystified, as do most </p><p>other observers, as to what President Mugabe could have meant </p><p>by his previous comments that loyal farmers will be allowed </p><p>to continue farming, and that every farmer who wanted to farm </p><p>would have land.  It is possible that this is empty rhetoric </p><p>along the lines of previous proclamations that no Zimbabwean </p><p>farmer has been forced off his land.  There is still little </p><p>indication of what official GOZ reaction will be forthcoming </p><p>in response to the farmers\' refusal to leave their lands. </p><p>What is certain is that an impasse has been reached, and </p><p>unless an acceptable compromise is offered by one side or the </p><p>other, confrontation -- whether violent or not -- is </p><p>inevitable.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
