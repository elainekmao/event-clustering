<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 005960 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB (PASI), EUR/WE (D.MENNUTI), S/P (VAN CLEVE) </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 201/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:DECL:11/13/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, AF, PK, IN, VT </p><p>SUBJECT:  PROGRESS OF WAR EFFORT REASSURES A WORRIED </p><p>VATICAN. </p><p> </p><p>REF A:  VATICAN 05286; REF B: VATICAN 05546 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (A) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05960  191507Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: VATICAN CRITICISM OF THE WAR EFFORT IS NOW </p><p>LESS LIKELY, ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN AFGHANISTAN DESK </p><p>OFFICER, SINCE ADVANCES BY THE U.S.-LED COALITION </p><p>FACILITATE A MORE EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO AFGHANISTAN\'S </p><p>HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAN ANTICIPATED. THE VATICAN HOWEVER </p><p>JUDGES ISLAMABAD AN UNRELIABLE COALITION PLAYER AND </p><p>DISTRUSTS MUSHARRAF.  POST RECOMMENDS DEPARTMENT EXPLORE </p><p>MEANS TO ENGAGE THE VATICAN IN HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN IN ORDER TO REINFORCE TACIT VATICAN SUPPORT FOR </p><p>U.S. POLICY GOALS IN AFGHANISTAN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE CHECKED </p><p>MOUNTING VATICAN MISGIVINGS AT THE WAR EFFORT (REF. A), </p><p>AFGHANISTAN DESK OFFICER MONSIGNOR LUIS MONTEMAYOR TOLD </p><p>POLOFF IN AN 11/14 MEETING.  A NEGATIVE VATICAN OR PAPAL </p><p>STATEMENT IS NOW EVEN LESS LIKELY, HE SAID, SINCE THE </p><p>TERRITORIAL ADVANCES OF THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE WOULD </p><p>FACILITATE THE RETURN OF NGOS TO AFGHANISTAN AND THE </p><p>DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN AID. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MONTEMAYOR ALSO INFORMED POLOFF THE THREE NUNS IN </p><p>KABUL WERE WELL (REF. B) AS OF 11/4. THE NUNS, MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE LITTLE SISTERS OF JESUS, WERE ASSISTING AT THE INDIRA </p><p>GANDHI HOSPITAL (STILL FUNCTIONING, IF UNOFFICIALLY, HE </p><p>ADDED) AND AT THE ALI ABAD CLINIC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MONTEMAYOR EXPRESSED PERSONAL SATISFACTION AT THE </p><p>PROGRESS OF THE U.S.-LED CAMPAIGN HOWEVER HE REITERATED THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS.  HE VOICED SKEPTICISM THAT </p><p>AFGHAN TRIBAL LEADERS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE OF THE NORTHERN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05960  191507Z </p><p>ALLIANCE, COULD PRODUCE A FUNCTIONING AND EQUITABLE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THE VATICAN WAS CLOSELY TRACKING ALLEGATIONS </p><p>OF ATROCITIES IN MAZAR-I-SHARIF AND HEART, HE SAID, ADDING </p><p>THAT THE CURRENT MILITARY ACTION RISKED DEGRADING INTO </p><p>TRIBAL VENDETTA BY OTHER MEANS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) PAKISTAN, MONTEMAYOR STATED, REMAINS A NATION OF </p><p>GRAVE CONCERN, BOTH IN REGARD TO THE PLIGHT OF ITS ONE </p><p>MILLION CATHOLICS, WHICH THE VATICAN CONSIDERS OPPRESSED, </p><p>AND IN TERMS OF ITS OVERALL STABILITY. MONTEMAYOR MADE </p><p>CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THE VATICAN AND </p><p>MUSHARRAF.  IN A LATE OCTOBER VISIT TO ISLAMABAD BY </p><p>ARCHBISHOP PAUL CORDES, HEAD OF COR UNUM, THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>UMBRELLA AID ARM, CONTACT WITH MUSHARRAF AND THE GOP WAS </p><p>KEPT TO A MINIMUM.  MONTEMAYOR REMARKED THAT INITIALLY </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S BISHOPS HAD CAUTIOUSLY WELCOMED MUSHARRAF\'S COUP </p><p>IN THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD EASE ANTI-BLASPHEMY LAWS </p><p>FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED TO KEEP RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN CHECK. </p><p>MUSHARRAF HOWEVER WAS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO CHALLENGE </p><p>ISLAMIC RADICALS AND THE CONDITIONS OF PAKISTAN\'S CATHOLICS </p><p>WORSENED.  THE VATICAN STRONGLY DOUBTS REPORTS OF A SEA </p><p>CHANGE IN MUSHARRAF\'S POLITICS.  MONTEMAYOR SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>IF BIN LADEN FINDS REFUGE IN BALUCHISTAN, THE U.S. WOULD </p><p>FIND MUSHARRAF HARD PUT TO DELIVER ON HIS PLEDGES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  THE SECRETARY\'S CALL TO TAURAN HAS </p><p>STRENGTHENED THE VATICAN MFA SUPPORT OF THE U.S.-LED WAR </p><p>EFFORT.  NEVERTHELESS, IN OTHER VATICAN QUARTERS -- </p><p>MONTEMAYOR REFERRED TO AN INTERNAL "HUMANITARIAN LOBBY" -- </p><p>PATIENCE WITH THE U.S.-LED WAR EFFORT HAD BEEN WEARING </p><p>THIN.  HOWEVER, THE LATEST MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05960  191507Z </p><p>AFGHANISTAN HAVE UNDERCUT THOSE WHO WERE URGING THE VATICAN </p><p>OPPOSE THE WAR EFFORT.  THE DEPARTMENT CAN REINFORCE ITS </p><p>SUPPORTERS WITHIN THE VATICAN BY SHARING ITS VIEWS ON THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.  U.S. INCLUSION </p><p>OF COR UNUM (AND CARITAS, A RELATED RELIEF ARM) WOULD HELP </p><p>ELEVATE THE VATICAN TO THE RANK OF A COALITION PARTNER IN </p><p>THE NEXT PHASE OF OUR EFFORTS. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA05960 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
