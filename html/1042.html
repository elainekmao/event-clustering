(SBU) SUMMARY: ON APRIL 6, ZIMBABWE\'S PARLIAMENT </p><p>PASSED A CONTROVERSIAL BILL, AMENDING THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONSTITUTION FOR THE 16TH TIME, TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO ACQUIRE LAND FOR RESETTLEMENT PURPOSES WITHOUT </p><p>COMPENSATION (REFTEL A).  THE VOTE FOLLOWED SOME ARM- </p><p>TWISTING BY PRESIDENT MUGABE, WHO ADDRESSED THE ZANU-PF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS EARLIER ON THE DAY OF THE VOTE AND </p><p>DIRECTED THEM TO SUPPORT THE PARTY POSITION ON LAND. </p><p>THE BILL HAD BEEN FAST-TRACKED BY THE EXECUTIVE IN THE </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF PARLIAMENT, CONVENED </p><p>SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS FROM APRIL 4 </p><p>TO 6.  DESPITE THE LEGISLATION, ENABLING THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO EFFECT ITS "POLITICAL SOLUTION" TO THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARM INVASIONS, THE WAR VETERAN LEADERSHIP HAS VOWED TO </p><p>REMAIN PUT AND GIVE UP NO LAND.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01914  01 OF 03  071114Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) OF THE 150 MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT (MPS)(ALL BUT </p><p>THREE ARE ZANU-PF MEMBERS), 100 MPS VOTED IN FAVOR OF </p><p>THE LAND ACQUISITION BILL ON APRIL 6, WITH ONE </p><p>ABSTENTION FROM OUTSPOKEN ZIMBABWE UNION OF DEMOCRATS </p><p>(ZUD) PARTY PRESIDENT, MARGARET DONGO.  THE REMAINING </p><p>MPS WERE NOT PRESENT FOR THE VOTE, ALTHOUGH NOT BECAUSE </p><p>OF ANY ORGANIZED BOYCOTT OR ABSTENTION.  DONGO TOLD </p><p>EMBOFFS ON APRIL 7 THAT SHE HAD BEEN LOBBYING HARD TO </p><p>BLOCK THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL AND BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD </p><p>GARNERED THE SUPPORT OF 20 OTHER MPS.  THE STRATEGY WAS </p><p>FOR THE CHIEF WHIP, MOSES MVENGE, TO CHALLENGE THE BILL </p><p>AND HAVE DONGO AND OTHERS JOIN IN, ACCORDING TO THE ZUD </p><p>PRESIDENT.  THE STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WAS </p><p>CONFIRMED BY OTHER MPS IN RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH </p><p>POLOFF AND AF DAS SCHNEIDMAN DURING HIS MARCH 22 TO 24 </p><p>VISIT TO ZIMBABWE (REFTELS A AND B).  THE DEAL FELL </p><p>APART WHEN PRESIDENT MUGABE WHIPPED THE MPS INTO LINE </p><p>DURING A MEETING HE HELD WITH THEM ON THE MORNING OF </p><p>APRIL 7, ONE OF THE VERY FEW TIMES HE HAS MET WITH THEM </p><p>AS A GROUP OUTSIDE OF HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MIKE MATAURE, FORMERLY CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY REFORM COMMITTEE, TOLD US ON APRIL 7 THAT </p><p>THE MPS HAD REQUESTED A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT TO </p><p>DISCUSS THEIR GRIEVANCES CONCERNING IRREGULARITIES IN </p><p>THE ONGOING ZANU-PF PARTY PRIMARIES.  MANY OF THE MPS </p><p>HAVE BEEN REJECTED IN THOSE PRIMARIES AND WILL NOT </p><p>RUNNING FOR REELECTION, INCLUDING SEVERAL MINISTERS, </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTERS AND PARTY STALWARTS.  OTHER MPS, </p><p>SENSING THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE RULING PARTY\'S BLESSINGS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01914  01 OF 03  071114Z </p><p>OR THAT RIGGING WOULD LED TO THEIR DEFEAT, CHOSE NOT TO </p><p>RUN ON A ZANU-PF TICKET.  THIS GROUP SAYS IT WILL RUN AS </p><p>INDEPENDENTS.  NEVERTHELESS, ALL 100 WHO VOTED FOR THE </p><p>LAND ACQUISITION BILL ATTENDED THE MEETING WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT, WHICH WAS HELD AT ZANU-PF PARTY HEADQUARTERS. </p><p>MUGABE REPORTEDLY LAID DOWN THE LAW -- VOTE WITH THE </p><p>PARTY ON THIS ISSUE, AS LAND IS A MATTER OF "NATIONAL </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY," AND WE WILL LOOK INTO YOUR GRIEVANCES </p><p>LATER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE LAND ACQUISITION BILL WAS INTRODUCED BY THE </p><p>MINISTER OF JUSTICE, LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, </p><p>EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, ON APRIL 4 AND APPROVED BY A TWO- </p><p>THIRD MAJORITY, AS REQUIRED FOR CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>AMENDMENTS, AFTER THE THIRD READING OF THE BILL TWO DAYS </p><p>LATER.  DONGO DISPUTES THAT THERE WAS A QUORUM, AS SHE </p><p>MAINTAINS THAT THE BILL REQUIRED 101 VOTES.  MINISTER OF </p><p>COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA, AND MINISTER </p><p>WITHOUT PORTFOLIO IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S CHIEF LAW OFFICER, EDDISON ZVOGBO, SPOKE IN </p><p>FAVOR OF THE BILL.  BOTH MEN ARGUED THAT THE LEGISLATION </p><p>WAS NOT RACIAL, ONLY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE LONG- </p><p>STANDING IMBALANCE OF LAND DISTRIBUTION IN ZIMBABWE, </p><p>OVER WHICH THE COUNTRY\'S WAR OF LIBERATION WAS FOUGHT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO0198 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01914  02 OF 03  071115Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-01 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01   VC-01    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     AC-01    DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /014W </p><p>                  ------------------48F8D9  071115Z /38 </p><p>P 071120Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5695 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 001914 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR ERIC HENDERSON </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND GRACE SONE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01914  02 OF 03  071115Z </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S - RENDER, GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO USAID AFR/SA - BILL JEFFERS, NNEWMAN </p><p>AA/AFR - VNEWTON, AND A/AID RMMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/00 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PHUM, EAID, EAGR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT PASSES CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON </p><p>LAND ACQUISITION </p><p> </p><p>NOW THAT THE MEMBERS HAVE COMPLETED THEIR LEGISLATIVE </p><p>BUSINESS, THEY ADJOURNED AND PARLIAMENT\'S LIFE LEGALLY </p><p>EXPIRES ON APRIL 12.  THE NEW PARLIAMENT WILL NOT COME </p><p>INTO EXISTENCE UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>SOME TIME IN MAY, ALTHOUGH MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE THE VOTE </p><p>CANNOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL LATE IN JUNE OR JULY BECAUSE OF </p><p>LOGISTICAL DELAYS.  CONSEQUENTLY, NO OTHER LEGISLATIVE </p><p>BUSINESS WILL BE DEALT WITH IN PARLIAMENT.  IN THE </p><p>INTERIM, MUGABE HAS AUTHORITY TO EFFECT "EMERGENCY </p><p>LEGISLATION" UNDER THE "PRESIDENTIAL POWERS ACT," SHOULD </p><p>HE DEEM ANY NECESSARY, ACCORDING TO THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>SPEAKER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) AMENDMENT 16 MUST NOW BE SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT, WHICH IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOON.  THIS BILL </p><p>CONTAINS IDENTICAL LAND ACQUISITION LANGUAGE AS THAT IN </p><p>CLAUSE 57 OF THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION, WHICH WAS REJECTED </p><p>IN FEBRUARY.  SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA, HAVE DESCRIBED THIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01914  02 OF 03  071115Z </p><p>LEGISLATION AS THEIR "POLITICAL SOLUTION" TO THE </p><p>OCCUPATION OF PRIMARILY WHITE-OWNED COMMERCIAL FARMS BY </p><p>WAR VETERANS (REFTEL B).  URBAN ZIMBABWEANS REMAIN </p><p>HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S MANIPULATION OF THE </p><p>LAND ISSUE.  THEY SEE IT AS A POLITICAL PLOY TO GAIN </p><p>SUPPORT IN ADVANCE OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  RURAL </p><p>PEOPLE HAVE ALSO INDICATED IN A RECENT POLL BY THE HELEN </p><p>SUZMAN FOUNDATION THAT LAND REDISTRIBUTION IS NOT THEIR </p><p>PRIORITY ISSUE.  NEVERTHELESS, LAND IS STILL A VERY </p><p>EMOTIONAL AND CONTENTIOUS ISSUE FOR BLACK AND WHITE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS WHO GENERALLY SUPPORT THE NEED FOR A </p><p>TRANSPARENT AND ORDERLY LAND REFORM PROGRAM.  IN THIS </p><p>REGARD, CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CONDEMNED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ATTEMPT TO EXPLOIT THE LAND QUESTION DURING </p><p>THIS CAMPAIGN SEASON AND CALLED FOR A MEANINGFUL LAND </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM, BUT HAVE NOT YET STRONGLY ATTACKED THIS </p><p>NEW BILL.  SIMILARLY, THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION, </p><p>WHOSE 4,500 MEMBERS ARE PRIMARILY WHITE, HAS NOT YET </p><p>RESPONDED PUBLICLY TO THE PASSAGE OF AMENDMENT 16. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL LIBERATION WAR </p><p>VETERANS ASSOCIATION (NLWVA), AGRIPPA GAVA, TOLD EMBOFFS </p><p>ON APRIL 6 THAT THE VETERANS WHO ARE OCCUPYING OVER 700 </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS ARE "NEVER GOING TO MOVE OFF THESE </p><p>FARMS."  GAVA DISMISSED THE GOVERNMENT\'S "POLITICAL </p><p>SOLUTION" AND INSISTED THAT THEY WILL NOT VACATE THE </p><p>LAND.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE POLICE HAVE DONE NOTHING TO </p><p>EFFECT A MARCH 17 COURT ORDER TO REMOVE THE ILLEGAL </p><p>OCCUPIERS, AND HAVE INSTEAD FILED A MOTION ASKING THE </p><p>COURT TO MODIFY THE EVICTION ORDER WHICH THE POLICE SAY </p><p>THEY CANNOT ENFORCE WITHOUT PROVOKING VIOLENCE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01914  02 OF 03  071115Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) THE BILL ALSO PROVIDED FOR THE CREATION OF AN </p><p>ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION, WHICH ONLY CAN MAKE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT ON MEASURES TO ENHANCE </p><p>INTEGRITY.  THE COMMISSION, HOWEVER, WHICH WILL BE </p><p>APPOINTED BY AND REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT, IS THEREFORE </p><p>NOT CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT AND WILL HAVE ONLY LIMITED </p><p>AUTHORITY TO PROSECUTE ANY ACTS OF CORRUPTION (REFTEL </p><p>C). </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT: THE GOVERNMENT HAS MAINTAINED THAT ITS </p><p>INTENT WITH CLAUSE 57 OF THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION AND NOW </p><p>WITH THE ADOPTED AMENDMENT 16 IS TO ALLOW IT TO ACQUIRE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARM LAND FOR RESETTLEMENT PURPOSES, AS </p><p>NEEDED, AND SUBJECT TO THE CRITERIA SET OUT IN THE </p><p>LEGISLATION.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSES ON ACTUAL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION THEN BECOMES MUCH MORE VAGUE, WITH SOME </p><p>DEGREE OF VACILLATION ON THE INTENT TO ACTUALLY TAKE ANY </p><p>FARMS WITHOUT PAYING COMPENSATION.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>AMENDMENT 16 ESTABLISHES THE LEGAL BASIS TO DO SO.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS NOW FACED WITH HOW TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS </p><p>OF THE WAR VETERANS AND THEIR UNEMPLOYED YOUTH </p><p>SUPPORTERS WHO MAY REFUSE TO LEAVE.  WHILE WE BELIEVE A </p><p>PORTION OF THE OCCUPIED FARMS WILL NOW BE VACATED, AS </p><p>THE SQUATTERS WERE ONLY ABLE TO REMAIN WITH GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1020 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01914  03 OF 03  071115Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01   VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------48F8E0  071116Z /38 </p><p>P 071120Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5696 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 001914 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR ERIC HENDERSON </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND GRACE SONE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S - RENDER, GURNEY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01914  03 OF 03  071115Z </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO USAID AFR/SA - BILL JEFFERS, NNEWMAN </p><p>AA/AFR - VNEWTON, AND A/AID RMMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/00 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PHUM, EAID, EAGR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT PASSES CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON </p><p>LAND ACQUISITION </p><p> </p><p>SUPPORT, THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE LOCATIONS WHERE THE WAR </p><p>VETS MIGHT RESIST EVICTION.
