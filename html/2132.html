<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002797 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ETTC, SOCI, PINS, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA\'S RISKS IN SUPPORTING US ON AFGHANISTAN </p><p> </p><p>A) Booth-Jeter Email 23OCT01 </p><p>B) State 170698 </p><p>C) Abuja 2793 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Since September 11, the Obasanjo Administration has </p><p>lent unequivocal diplomatic support to USG anti-terrorists </p><p>efforts, including coalition military operations against Al </p><p>Qaeda and its Taliban hosts.  This unambiguous support was </p><p>not a given.  Nigeria, home to Sub-Saharan Africa  largest </p><p>Muslim population has its own ethno-religious dynamic. </p><p>Domestic political expedience would have had Obasanjo hold </p><p>his tongue, mute his support, or condemn both the September </p><p>11 attacks and our response.  However, he did not flinch. </p><p>Acting more a statesman than a politician on this issue, he </p><p>moved toward what he thought were Nigeria  wider, long- </p><p>term interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) As a result, Obasanjo and his Administration have </p><p>been on the receiving end of a stream of invective from a </p><p>small but vocal clique of northern politicians and Islamic </p><p>clerics.  Some disliked his decision; some simply dislike </p><p>him and seek any opportunity to criticize.  Obasanjo  firm </p><p>anti-terrorism stance has had a minimal direct, measurable </p><p>impact on internal security thus far (violence in Kano </p><p>being the clearest exception).  But simmering tensions in </p><p>many parts of Nigeria do not need much more heat to boil </p><p>over.  The President\'s principled stand also highlighted </p><p>the reality of the country  preexisting religious divide: </p><p>The largely Christian South tends to support U.S. action </p><p>while the mostly Muslim North is deeply ambivalent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Depending how our military operations unfold, the </p><p>negative rhetoric of Obasanjo  militant critics could gain </p><p>adherents, grow feet and take to the streets.  Further </p><p>demonstrations are almost certain and could turn violent, </p><p>especially if civilian casualties are perceived to be </p><p>increasing sharply as a result of our continuing military </p><p>operations.  With elections so near and party nominating </p><p>conventions even closer, Obasanjo (should he run) will have </p><p>to wrestle claims that he kowtowed to American pressure </p><p>while ignoring the sensitivities of (the Muslim) half of </p><p>Nigeria\'s population. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Against this backdrop, President Obasanjo arrives in </p><p>the U.S. to confer with President Bush about counter- </p><p>terrorism.  We must keep these factors in mind as we seek </p><p>to forge greater cooperation between Washington and Abuja </p><p>on this paramount issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) With statements condemning the attacks and </p><p>supporting our military action, Nigeria has run the field </p><p>on what it can do as a matter of unilateral public </p><p>diplomacy.  Thus, our strategy for counter-terrorism </p><p>cooperation with Nigeria must rest on three columns. </p><p>First, we must encourage Nigeria toward concrete unilateral </p><p>actions that actualize its public statements.  Second, </p><p>Nigeria should play a leading role in multilateral fora, </p><p>in Africa and beyond.  Third, we should minimize actions </p><p>that might spark internal unrest in Nigeria attributable to </p><p>GON support for our efforts.  It would be a blow to our </p><p>objective to build an anti-terrorism front in Africa if his </p><p>strong support for us weakened Obasanjo internally.  It </p><p>could scare other leaders and embolden our adversaries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>CONCRETE ACTION AT HOME </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) MONEY LAUNDERING: Given Nigeria  lax regulatory </p><p>scheme, the local financial system is potentially an </p><p>attractive haven for terrorist funds.  Nigeria must work </p><p>hard to seal this sieve.  Obasanjo has promised a Financial </p><p>Crimes Commission (FCC) and an omnibus money-laundering law </p><p>to replace the current law that only governs drug related </p><p>laundering.  We should accede to Obasanjo  request for </p><p>assistance in building the FCC and implementing the draft </p><p>money laundering legislation (Ref C).  We should also send </p><p>experts to help the Central Bank of Nigeria\'s efforts to </p><p>identify terrorist bank accounts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S/NF) INTELLIGENCE SHARING: We are already sharing more </p><p>intelligence with the Nigerians than any other African </p><p>service.  Yet Nigeria\'s strong support, its importance in </p><p>Africa, and the possibility that parts of Africa may be </p><p>attractive alternate havens for some terrorists, make a </p><p>case for us to consider a higher level of intelligence </p><p>sharing.  This step would require a political decision in </p><p>both capitals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COUNTER-TERRORISM TRAINING: Nigeria  police and </p><p>overall security apparatus are not trained for counter- </p><p>terrorism.  We could help Nigeria train a small, sharply- </p><p>focused inter-agency unit that could coordinate anti- </p><p>terrorism efforts here.  This unit could be tasked with </p><p>looking for ways of improving counter-terrorism measures </p><p>for oil installations.  We recognize that establishing </p><p>effective inter-agency groups is never easy.  Each agency </p><p>has its turf and established interests.  However, if the </p><p>number of agencies is kept to a minimum, this concept could </p><p>work.  Given our post-September 11 security imperatives and </p><p>our long-term energy security concerns, this concept may be </p><p>worth exploring. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) SOFA: A SOFA would likely cause great consternation </p><p>within Nigeria, and could cost the GON political capital </p><p>that could be more effectively invested elsewhere.  Some </p><p>alleged before 9/11 that Operation Focus Relief was really </p><p>intended to establish bases from which the U.S. could </p><p>strike troublesome Muslim countries.  OFR is proceeding </p><p>smoothly now, and we need to keep it that way.  Generally, </p><p>the Nigerian public mistrusts mil-to-mil relationships, and </p><p>not everyone loves OFR.  Seeking a SOFA risks raising many </p><p>issues that are best not addressed now.  We can get most of </p><p>what we want/need without a formal SOFA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS AND MLAT: There is </p><p>little cost for the GON to sign and ratify the anti- </p><p>terrorism conventions and the MLAT.  We should continue to </p><p>urge these steps.  On this and other points it may be </p><p>useful to state that we expect Nigeria to lead Africa, and </p><p>certainly West Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) INVITING AMERICAN MUSLIMS: We should raise with </p><p>Nigeria the idea of gathering a team of Muslim notables to </p><p>visit the U.S., particularly to see WTC ground zero and </p><p>talk to representatives of the Muslim community there. </p><p>This might lead to a reciprocal visit.  We need to change </p><p>the picture many Nigerian Muslims have of the U.S. as anti- </p><p>Islamic.  They need to understand that the U.S. is an open, </p><p>tolerant society that welcomes Muslims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>NIGERIA  AKING THE LEAD IN THE REGION </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) We need to press Nigeria to work within the Sub- </p><p>Saharan African institutional framework to ensure that </p><p>African multilateral institutions, particularly ECOWAS, </p><p>support our efforts diplomatically and with practical </p><p>steps.  Nigeria can also play a useful role beyond Africa </p><p>through its active participation in the G-77, D-8, and NAM, </p><p>among other organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (S/NF) ECOWAS SUMMIT: Nigeria should use its weight to </p><p>ensure that counter-terrorism is a focal point on the </p><p>agenda for the Summit tentatively set for December.  We </p><p>would like a strong statement from ECOWAS and would urge </p><p>Nigeria to push for all member countries to sign extant </p><p>terrorism conventions.  ECOWAS should establish a sub- </p><p>regional counter-terrorism mechanism.  We should be </p><p>prepared to have senior intelligence personnel to meet with </p><p>ECOWAS counterparts to discuss intelligence sharing and </p><p>counter-terrorism training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) We should explore with Nigeria and Senegal ways </p><p>that Wade  Terrorism Initiative can be made useful. </p><p>Africa (through the AU or NEPAD), and ECOWAS regionally, </p><p>must align their efforts so they become complementary. </p><p>Nigeria can and should be expected to lead on both levels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) SUDAN: Nigeria  participation in the Sudan Peace </p><p>Process may provide another avenue to influence Khartoum </p><p>regarding its support for terrorism.  Nigeria, a broker in </p><p>the peace process, has decent relations with the NIF </p><p>government.  We should work with Nigeria to see how it can </p><p>use its role in the peace process and as a leading African </p><p>nation to persuade Sudan to wash its hands of supporting </p><p>terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>HEARTS AND MINDS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Public opinion among Nigeria\'s Muslims is slowly </p><p>turning against us.  Those long opposed to us are taking </p><p>ever-harder lines.  We want to reverse this trend but need </p><p>concrete support.  We should draw a clearer evidentiary </p><p>link between the September 11 attacks and Usama Bin Laden. </p><p>This will go far to address the concerns of those who </p><p>condemn the attacks but think we pinned them on UBL because </p><p>of an anti-Muslim bias.  The U.K. FCO website contains much </p><p>of the material in reftel B (classified demarche cable), </p><p>yet we cannot present this information to Muslim Nigeria as </p><p>the USG position.  Our silence is viewed in many quarters </p><p>as proof of the weakness of our "case."  The Department </p><p>should review its restriction on dissemination of the </p><p>information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Also, we may need to reshape our message regarding </p><p>civilian casualties in Afghanistan.  While we continue to </p><p>assert that civilians are not targets, Nigerians continue </p><p>to hear and see news of civilian deaths.  For many Nigerian </p><p>Muslims, the fact that our stand-off munitions are killing </p><p>(Muslim) Afghan civilians, and we know that such unintended </p><p>deaths inevitably will result, makes us "terrorists" too. </p><p>While it would be easy to dismiss this logic as twisted, we </p><p>must understand and respond appropriately to it if we wish </p><p>to win hearts and minds.  To the extent possible, we need </p><p>to explain the steps taken to minimize civilian casualties. </p><p>We also need to be more aggressive stating when and if the </p><p>Taliban is using the civilian population as a shield.  Our </p><p>PD regarding USG humanitarian efforts seems to have fallen </p><p>off; this needs to be re-energized. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
