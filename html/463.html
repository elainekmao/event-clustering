<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 DHAKA 05954 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, BG </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEETING WITH AWAMI LEAGUE LEADER SHEIKH HASINA </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  I MET WITH THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION, </p><p>SHEIKH HASINA, IN AN EXTRAORDINARILY LONG, TWO-HOUR </p><p>MEETING ON JULY 10.  CLEARLY SHEIKH HASINA WANTS TO </p><p>IMPROVE HER IMAGE, AND THAT OF THE AWAMI LEAGUE, WITH </p><p>AMERICANS, AND THE USG.  SHE RAISED THE ISSUE OF </p><p>WHETHER THE U.S. OPPOSED HER AND/OR HER PARTY.  SHE </p><p>ALSO SAID THAT THE BNP GOVERNMENT WAS BECOMING </p><p>AUTHORITARIAN AND, ITSELF, ERODING INFANT DEMOCRATIC </p><p>STRUCTURES.  SHE SAID THAT ONLY THE BNP GOVERNMENT </p><p>COULD SOLVE THE UNIVERSITY SITUATION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SHEIKH HASINA APPEARED RELAXED AND MUCH MORE </p><p>FRIENDLY THAN USUAL IN OUR TWO-HOUR MEETING ON JULY 10. </p><p>IT IS CLEAR SHE WANTS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>USG (WE HAVE HEARD THIS FROM ANOTHER SOURCE ALSO). </p><p>IN PREVIOUS MEETINGS, SHE HAS APPEARED TENSE AND </p><p>SOMEWHAT ON GUARD; IN THIS MEETING, SHE SEEMED MUCH </p><p>MORE OPEN AND WILLING TO DISCUSS A RANGE OF ISSUES </p><p>WITHOUT THE USUAL SLOGANEERING.  HER RELAXED DEMEANOR </p><p>WAS ALSO EVIDENCED BY HER WILLINGNESS TO TALK ABOUT </p><p>HER FAMILY AND OTHER PERSONAL ITEMS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SHE BEGAN THE DISCUSSION BY SAYING THAT SHE HAD </p><p>JUST COME FROM A MEETING WITH UPAZILLA CHAIRMEN WHO </p><p>WERE EXTREMELY UPSET BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING </p><p>DISMISSED BY THE BNP GOVERNMENT.  AS SHE POINTED OUT, </p><p>THESE CHAIRMEN WERE ELECTED IN THE UPAZILLA ELECTIONS </p><p>OF MARCH 1990, AND THEIR TERMS ARE NOT YET COMPLETED. </p><p>SHEIKH HASINA RAISED THE QUESTION OF HOW ELECTED </p><p>UPAZILLA CHAIRMEN COULD BE DISMISSED BY THE MAJORITY </p><p>PARTY IN THE PARLIAMENT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THIS LED HER TO EXPAND ON THE SUBJECT OF THE GROWING </p><p>AUTHORITARIANISM OF THE BNP.  SHEIKH HASINA SAID THAT, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THE BNP WAS HARASSING AWAMI LEAGUE </p><p>MEMBERS AND WORKERS IN VILLAGES AND UPAZILLAS THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE COUNTRY.  SHE MENTIONED THE BNP-PROPOSED CONSITU- </p><p>TIONAL AMENDMENT, WHICH WOULD RESTORE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN BANGLADESH, AS EVIDENCE OF THE GROWING </p><p>AUTHORITARIAN CAST OF THE BNP GOVERNMENT.  SHE SAID </p><p>THAT THE BNP PROPOSAL CONTAINS A PROVISION THAT THE </p><p>PRESIDENT IS "BOUND" TO DISSOLVE THE PARLIAMENT IF </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER SO REQUESTS.  THE AWAMI LEAGUE, </p><p>SHEIKH HASINA SAID, IS OPPOSED TO THIS SHACKLING </p><p>OF PRESIDENTIAL DISCRETION ON THE MATTER OF DISSOLUTION </p><p>OF THE PARLIAMENT.  SHE MENTIONED ALSO THAT THE AWAMI </p><p>LEAGUE WAS VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO THE PROVISION THAT </p><p>WOULD BAR A PARTY MEMBER WHO CROSSED THE FLOOR FROM </p><p>RUNNING FOR REELECTION FOR FIVE YEARS.  SHEIKH </p><p>HASINA POINTED OUT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD END </p><p>UP WITH AUTHORITARIAN POWERS OVER HER PARTY AND OVER </p><p>ANY DISSENTERS IN IT THROUGH SUCH PROVISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO LEAD HER PARTY IN </p><p>RESPONSIBLE OPPOSITION.  SHE POINTED OUT THAT THERE HAD </p><p>BEEN PRESSURE WITHIN THE AWAMI LEAGUE FOR INSISTING </p><p>THAT THE "INDEMNITY BILL" BE LINKED TO THE CONSTITU- </p><p>TIONAL AMENDMENT.  (THE INDEMNITY BILL IS A BILL WHICH </p><p>AUTHORIZES THE PROSECUTION OF THE ASSASSINS OF HER </p><p>FATHER, SHEIKH MUJIB.)  SHE RESISTED THESE PRESSURES </p><p>AND INSTEAD DIRECTED THAT THE INDEMNITY BILL BE PUT </p><p>IN AS A SEPARATE BILL, TO BE DEBATED ON ITS OWN MERITS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  I MENTIONED THAT WE HAD NOTED HER RESPONSIBLE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, AND PRAISED HER </p><p>FOR KEEPING OPPOSITION TO THE BNP GOVERNMENT WITHIN </p><p>THE CONFINES OF PARLIAMENT.  I INDICATED THAT THE </p><p>ROOTS OF DEMOCRACY MUST SINK DEEP AND TAKE GOOD </p><p>HOLD, AND THAT A RESPONSIBLE OPPOSITION, CONFINING </p><p>ITS OPPOSITION TO LEGITIMATE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES, </p><p>WOULD HAVE GREAT BEARING ON THE ABILITY OF DEMOCRACY </p><p>TO FLOURISH. </p><p> </p><p>8.  I ASKED ABOUT THE STUDENT VIOLENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY. </p><p>I INDICATED THAT IN MY VIEW THIS ISSUE HAD TO BE </p><p>RESOLVED QUICKLY IF IT WAS NOT TO SPREAD AND WORSEN. </p><p>I WENT ON TO SUGGEST THAT ALL PARTIES WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>AGREE TO REFRAIN FROM BACKING THEIR STUDENTS IN THESE </p><p>UNIVERSITIES POWER STRUGGLES, AND INDICATE TO THEIR </p><p>STUDENT FACTIONS THAT THEY WOULD NOT SUPPORT THE </p><p>USE OF ARMS OR VIOLENCE ON THE CAMPUS.  SHEIKH HASINA </p><p>REPLIED THAT IT IS UP TO THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP </p><p>VIOLENCE ON THE CAMPUS.  SHE BLAMED THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>FOR CONTINUING TO ALLOW STUDENT VIOLENCE TO OCCUR. </p><p>SHE SAID THAT, IF THE GOVERNMENT CRACKED DOWN, THE </p><p>SITUATION COULD BE RECTIFIED IN 30 MINUTES.  THESE </p><p>STUDENTS ONLY HAVE WEAPONS SHE SAID BECAUSE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT LOOKS THE OTHER WAY.  SHE WOULD SUPPORT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT IN A GENERAL AGREEMENT TO BACK AWAY </p><p>FROM STUDENT POLITICIZATION AND ON DISARMING THE CAMPUS. </p><p>WHEN PRESSED, SHE MENTIONED THAT THE MAIN REASON SHE </p><p>WOULD SUPPORT SUCH A RESOLUTION IS BECAUSE ARMING </p><p>THE STUDENTS IS COSTLY.  SHE SAID THE AWAMI LEAGUE </p><p>CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO SUPPLY ITS STUDENTS WITH </p><p>ARMS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE CONVERSATION SHIFTED TO U.S. PRESENCE IN </p><p>BANGLADESH, PARTICULARLY AFTER I BROACHED THE SUBJECT </p><p>OF THE RECENT VISIT OF THE PEACE CORPS DIRECTOR, PAUL </p><p>COVERDELL.  I MENTIONED THAT, IN 1978, A PEACE CORPS </p><p>AGREEMENT HAD BEEN SIGNED BUT THAT THE THEN-GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIA RAHMAN HAD NEVER ESTABLISHED A PEACE CORPS </p><p>PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE REACTION OF THE OPPOSITION, </p><p>INCLUDING HER PARTY.  I WENT ON TO DESCRIBE THE PEACE </p><p>CORPS AS A VOLUNTEER, FACE-TO-FACE ORGANIZATION WHICH </p><p>ESSENTIALLY WORKS AT THE MICRO LEVEL, USUALLY UNDER </p><p>THE DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF.  SHEIKH </p><p>HASINA DID NOT RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE POINTS I MADE </p><p>ABOUT THE PEACE CORPS.  INSTEAD SHE ASKED ME WHETHER </p><p>THE U.S. OPPOSES HER AND OR HER PARTY.  SHE SAID THAT </p><p>ONE OF THE CURRENT RUMORS IN BANGLADESH, PARTICULARLY </p><p>AMONG HER OWN PARTY WORKERS, IS THAT THE U.S. IS </p><p>STRONGLY OPPOSED EITHER TO HER OR TO HER PARTY </p><p>COMING TO POWER. </p><p> </p><p>10.  I RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY THAT THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE </p><p>TO THIS RUMOR AND THAT WE DID NOT TAKE SIDES AMONG </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES IN ANY COUNTRY, AND THAT WE WOULD </p><p>WORK EAGERLY AND POITIVELY WITH ANY GOVERNMENT ELECTED </p><p>BY THE PEOPLE OF BANGLADESH.  IMENTIONED THAT WE </p><p>DID NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF THE PARTY </p><p>PROGRAMS OF MOST OF THE PARTIES IN BANGLADESH.  I SAID </p><p>THAT THE TNDENCY ON THE PART OF SOME ELEMENTS 0F THE </p><p>AL TO THINK IN TERMS OF OCIALIST SOLUTIONS HAD ALWAYS </p><p>BEEN TROUBLESOME TO US.  I ALS MENTIONED THAT, AS </p><p>HAD BEEN DEMONSTRATED OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS, THERE </p><p>WERE SMALL ELEMENTS OF HER PARTY AND OF THE LEFTIST </p><p>PARTIES WITH WHICH THE AL IS ALIGNED, TOWARDS A KNEE- </p><p>JERK ANTI-AMERICANISM.  SHE RESPONDED THAT THERE IS </p><p>STILL THE FEELING AMONG SOME MEMBERS OF HER PARTY\'S </p><p>CADRE THAT THE U.S. WAS SOMEHOW IMPLICATED IN THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF HER FATHER.  SHEIKH HASINA SAID THAT </p><p>SHE HAD TAKEN GREAT RISK WHEN SHE VISITED THE U.S. </p><p>FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE MIDDLE 1980\'S.  SHE STATED </p><p>THAT SHE HAD BEEN CRITICIZED LOUDLY BY MANY PARTS OF </p><p>HER PARTY AS WELL AS OTHER PARTIES FOR DOING BUSINESS </p><p>WITH THE AMERICANS.  SHE WENT ON TO SAY THAT SHE </p><p>DOES NOT THINK THAT MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF HER PARTY </p><p>STILL HOLD THIS VIEW, BUT THAT SOME DO.  SHE SAID </p><p>THAT PERHAPS THE U.S. SHOULD HAVE WORKED HARDER TO </p><p>REBUT THESE ALLEGATIONS IN THE EARLY YEARS AFTER THEY </p><p>OCCURRED, AND THAT THE USG SHOULD STILL SEEK TO ASSURE </p><p>PEOPLE THAT IT HAD NO CONNECTION WITH SHEIKH MUJIB\'S </p><p>DEATH, WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  SHEIKH HASINA SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME </p><p>EXPLAINING WHY THE PARTY\'S CALL FOR SOCIALISM WAS </p><p>REALLY NOT/NOT A CALL FOR SOCIALISM.  SHE SAID THAT </p><p>SHE PERSONALLY HAD NO SYMPATHY FOR SOCIALISM, THAT SHE </p><p>KNOWS THAT IT IS A FAILED SYSTEM, EVERYWHERE.  SHE SAID </p><p>THAT THE ONLY PRESCRIPTION SHE WANTED WAS HOW TO HELP </p><p>THE BANGLADESH PEOPLE DEVELOP ECONOMICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  I ASSURED HER AGAIN THAT WE DO NOT INTERFERE IN </p><p>THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF COUNTRIES AND WE WORK </p><p>POSITIVELY WITH FREELY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS.  SHE </p><p>MENTIONED THAT IN PART, THE ANTI-AMERICAN CAST OF </p><p>SOME AL WORKERS MIGHT ALSO STEM FROM OUR PERCEIVED </p><p>PROCLIVITY TO WORK WITH ANTI-DEMOCRATIC FORCES SUCH </p><p>AS THE PREVIOUS REGIME.  (NOTE: SHEIKH HASINA CON- </p><p>TINUALLY THROWS THE REGIME OF ZIA RAHMAN INTO THE </p><p>ANTI-DEMOCRATIC FORCES.) </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE MEETING ENDED ON A VERY FRIENDLY NOTE.  TOWARDS </p><p>THE END, I SUGGESTED THAT IF SHEIKH HASINA WERE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER WE WOULD BE WORKING CLOSELY AND POSITIVELY </p><p>WITH HER, AS WE WOULD WITH MOST GOVERNMENTS.  WHEN I </p><p>SAID THAT SHE MIGHT NOW BE PRIME MINISTER, SHE LIFTED </p><p>HER EYES TO THE CEILING AND SAID "GOD HELP ME," </p><p>IMPLYING VERY STRONGLY THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY PREPARED </p><p>AT THIS POINT IN BANGLADESH HISTORY, WITH ALL THE </p><p>IMMENSE PROBLEMS THE NEW GOVERNMENT FACES, TO SIT IN </p><p>OPPOSITION.  DURING THIS SAME PART OF THE CONVERSATION, </p><p>I HAD MENTIONED THE TREMENDOUS TASK THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS IN REFORMING THE ECONOMY AND SHE AGREED WITH </p><p>THAT, AND UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WOULD TAKE VERY, VERY </p><p>HARD DECISIONS ON VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>14.  COMMENT:  I AM UNABLE TO JUDGE WHETHER SHEIKH </p><p>HASINA REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE U"S. OPPOSES HER </p><p>OR HER PARTY.  HOWEVER, THE LENGTH OF THE MEETING, </p><p>ITS WARMTH, AND HER RELAXATION CLEARLY INDICATE THAT </p><p>SHE WANTS TO IMPROVE HER TIES TO ME, TO THIS MISSION, </p><p>AND TO THE USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MILAM </p><p></p></div>
