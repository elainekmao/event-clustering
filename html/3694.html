<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002563 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/CIP </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR COMMATT:DTHOMPSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, EINV, KPRV, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: PRE-QUALIFICATION FOR 25-YEAR HONDURAN CELLULAR </p><p>SERVICES CONTRACT </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEGUCIGALPA 02043 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Two American cellular companies were </p><p>among six who applied for pre-qualification to bid on the </p><p>GOH\'s 25-year cellular service contract.  The winner of the </p><p>bid will be the only competition for Honduras\' current </p><p>cellular provider, Celtel (majority owned by Motorola). </p><p>Conatel plans to announce the qualifying companies on or </p><p>about October 8, 2002 and the official bid opening is </p><p>scheduled for January 2003. The GOH has, unfortunately, </p><p>limited the evaluation criteria to the size of the </p><p>concession fee paid to the government.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On September 9, 2002, Contatel, Honduras\' </p><p>Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, held an open pre- </p><p>qualification process for companies who are planning to bid </p><p>on the Honduran cellular service contract.  Two American </p><p>companies, Bell South Honduras (comprised of Bell South </p><p>Honduras, BS Chile, BS U.S., BS Nicaragua and BS Guatemala) </p><p>and Digicel Honduras (U.S. partners with Salvadoran and </p><p>Italian investment) applied.  The other potential contenders </p><p>include Radio Movil Dipsa, S.A. de C.V. (TeleMex of Mexico), </p><p>Telecomunicaciones de Guatemala (TelGuat of Guatemala), </p><p>Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones, S.A. (Entel Chile - </p><p>an Italian backed Chilean company) and Megatel - Emce </p><p>(ENITEL, a Honduran company owned by Freddy Nasser).  This </p><p>cellular service contract would be for one of Honduras\' </p><p>three Personal Communication Systems (PCS) bands, not the </p><p>highly politicized cellular band B (reftel). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Conatel will officially announce by October 8, 2002, </p><p>which companies qualify and will go on to the second phase </p><p>of the bidding.  During the pre-qualification process, </p><p>Conatel will check that the firms meet certain business </p><p>criteria, including having annual sales upwards of USD 150 </p><p>million and a company user market of minimum 500,000 mobile </p><p>users.  Conatel is looking for large companies only for the </p><p>bid.  The winner of the 25-year contract would be in </p><p>competition with Honduras\' only other cellular services </p><p>provider, Celtel (majority owned by the U.S. firm, </p><p>Motorola). </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Celtel has expanded lines rapidly, and now accounts </p><p>for approximately half of total phone lines in the country. </p><p>However, cell phone rates are very high by Central American </p><p>standards and service coverage is generally limited to </p><p>Honduras\' largest cities.  Celtel\'s contract with Conatel is </p><p>currently under dispute.  Originally, Celtel held a ten-year </p><p>contract that is set to expire in 2006.  However, on </p><p>principles of fairness, Conatel extended Celtel\'s contract </p><p>an additional 15 years to equal Hondutel\'s (Honduras state- </p><p>owned telephone company) current 25-year contract.  Two </p><p>deputies in the Honduran National Congress did not agree </p><p>with Conatel\'s decision.  The Public Ministry is currently </p><p>suing Conatel over the Celtel extension. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The final bid opening is forecast for sometime in </p><p>January of 2003. The winner of the bid will be based solely </p><p>on the highest bid presented.  Comment:  The GOH\'s decision </p><p>to not include other criteria in this concession, such as </p><p>expanded coverage and other customer service issues, appears </p><p>shortsighted.  However, it appears that a simple price-based </p><p>concession is considered more likely to obtain congressional </p><p>support.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
