<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 001914 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/01/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: PROPOSED VISIT TO JORDAN BY TREASURY AUDITING TEAM </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Post learned by email from NEA that Treasury Under </p><p>Secretary Taylor contacted Jordanian Finance Minister Michel </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Marto and Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Governor Umayya Toukan </p><p>regarding Treasury\'s interest in sending a small auditing </p><p>team to Amman to learn more about the activities and </p><p>functioning of the Amman branch of Iraq\'s Rafidain Bank.  We </p><p>understand from a subsequent email that Treasury believed </p><p>that U/S Taylor had secured Jordanian concurrence for such a </p><p>visit. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Regrettably, our interlocutors are unable to confirm </p><p>an agreement to receive a Treasury team.  Finance Minister </p><p>Marto told the Ambassador March 27 that while he had no </p><p>objection personally, he had referred U/S Taylor to Governor </p><p>Toukan as the appropriate authority.  Deputy Governor </p><p>Muhammad Said Shahin told ECON/C March 31 that the Governor </p><p>did not recall having approved a visit by such a team.  After </p><p>consulting again with the Governor, Shahin confirmed that </p><p>Toukan believes he told U/S Taylor that such a request would </p><p>have to be made through formal diplomatic channels so as to </p><p>secure the agreement of the government as a whole.  The </p><p>Governor had, Shahin said, told U/S Taylor that he would be </p><p>willing to review a Treasury questionnaire regarding </p><p>Rafidain\'s local activities, which should also be submitted </p><p>through diplomatic channels. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Shahin noted that the Rafidain branch was subject to </p><p>Jordanian laws and to the same CBJ supervision as any other </p><p>bank in Jordan.  He reiterated that the CBJ continues at his </p><p>and the Governor\'s level to monitor individual transactions </p><p>involving Iraqi accounts in Jordanian banks (including at </p><p>Rafidain) and to block any transaction believed to involve </p><p>the Iraqi government or its fronts.  This is done in </p><p>coordination with other GOJ agencies, including the </p><p>intelligence services.  Shahin added that he had been </p><p>surprised at the relatively small number of requests for such </p><p>transactions. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment:  Shahin made clear that the CBJ was ready </p><p>to cooperate with Treasury provided it had political </p><p>authorization.  The Bank would also want to examine the </p><p>domestic legal ramifications and to set parameters for a </p><p>team\'s mission.  Shahin said that PM Abul Ragheb was aware of </p><p>Treasury\'s interest.  Post would be happy to support a </p><p>Treasury visit and to facilitate a formal request for </p><p>Jordanian government approval if instructed to do by </p><p>Washington and would be prepared to request M authorization </p><p>for the visit under standing guidelines for authorized </p><p>departure.  Such an instruction from Washington should </p><p>contain a specific description of a team\'s proposed mission </p><p>and objectives.  We also note that the security threat in </p><p>Amman remains very high.  In addition, the subject the team </p><p>would be looking into is highly sensitive, as Shahin pointed </p><p>out.  For these reasons, and if accepted by the Jordanians, a </p><p>team would need to keep an extremely low profile, working out </p><p>of the Embassy building with the support and involvement of </p><p>Economic Section staff. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
