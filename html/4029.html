<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002315 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PHUM, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE TEACHERS\' STRIKE: GOZ RIDING ROUGHSHOD </p><p>OVER WORKER DISCONTENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2308 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Laboff Karen Bel for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary:  In events which have been monitored </p><p>world-wide, the GOZ has cracked down on striking members of </p><p>the Progressive Teachers, Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) with </p><p>characteristic harshness.  After GOZ responses which included </p><p>PTUZ office raids, dubious arrests of PTUZ members, assault, </p><p>threats and harassment of the PTUZ leader Raymond Majongwe,s </p><p>family, and detention of Majongwe with subsequent allegations </p><p>of torture while in police custody, the GOZ announced that </p><p>all striking teachers were summarily fired.  In a new </p><p>development, Majongwe was re-arrested on October 16, possibly </p><p>tortured, and "lost" in the system for several days before </p><p>his scheduled October 21 bail hearing.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Teachers\' Strike </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  The teachers\' strike -- which began as a "go-slow" </p><p>action on September 6 -- developed into a full-fledged strike </p><p>on October 8.  The strike was called by PTUZ, which has a </p><p>constituency of approximately 15,000 members, rather than the </p><p>ZANU-PF-allied Zimbabwe Teachers, Association (ZIMTA), which </p><p>claims 55,000 members.  PTUZ has been much more </p><p>confrontational than ZIMTA in addressing teachers, </p><p>grievances over the past year.  The Secretary General of </p><p>ZIMTA has stated that his organization is involved in </p><p>"dialogue" with the GOZ regarding pay raises, and has </p><p>formally distanced his organization from the strike. </p><p>However, according to the AFL-CIO Solidarity Center, the PTUZ </p><p>hopes for widespread support for the strike by the rank and </p><p>file membership of ZIMTA beginning this week.  Chief among </p><p>the teachers, complaints are low salary and poor working </p><p>conditions.  Although teachers are considered to be civil </p><p>servants providing "essential services" (and thus precluded </p><p>from engaging in a strike) along with police, medical </p><p>personnel, and armed forces, their remuneration lags far </p><p>behind that of their supposed peers.  Additionally, teachers </p><p>have been subjected to relentless assault and harassment from </p><p>both war vets and youth militia groups, in some cases fleeing </p><p>their rural schools in terror, whenever they are suspected of </p><p>sympathizing with the opposition MDC party. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  The strike has been described by labor groups as a </p><p>"matter of survival."  Newly-qualified teachers earn Zim </p><p>$25,000 per month after a three-year training course </p><p>(approximately US $26.31 at current parallel exchange rates), </p><p>while newly-qualified nurses earn Zim $60,000 per month </p><p>(approximately US $63.15).  New police constables earn </p><p>approximately Zim $30,000 per month (US $31.57) after a </p><p>one-year training course, and new army privates earns </p><p>slightly more just by virtue of passing the physical. </p><p>Members of the uniformed forces were awarded a 165% increase </p><p>in salary during the last year, and doctors and nurses have </p><p>been awarded "significant" increases in their pay packages </p><p>after a strike in July/August, while teachers were granted a </p><p>mere 55% increase in salary last January (with an official </p><p>inflation rate of 139%). </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Despite assurances by the GOZ that teachers would be </p><p>awarded "massive" salary increases in January 2003, the PTUZ </p><p>urged all teachers -- whether PTUZ members or not -- to </p><p>participate in the strike by reporting to work and then </p><p>refusing to teach.  The PTUZ estimates that approximately 85% </p><p>of their members have engaged in the work stoppage, along </p><p>with approximately 15% of ZIMTA members, in the face of GOZ </p><p>proclamations that the work action was a failure.  However, </p><p>after several days of striking, the Public Service Commission </p><p>announced on October 15 that 627 teachers had been fired for </p><p>engaging in the strike.  The PTUZ has challenged the </p><p>dismissals, claming that the labor action is legal and that </p><p>the dismissals did not follow procedural steps.  The </p><p>dismissals have earned world-wide condemnation by labor and </p><p>civil society groups, including the International </p><p>Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and AFL-CIO. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Arrest and Alleged Torture of Union President </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) According to published reports, police arrested the </p><p>PTUZ president and secretary on October 8 and confiscated </p><p>some files and the office keys.  The president and secretary </p><p>were released on the same day, but the secretary was ordered </p><p>to close down the PTUZ office.  Early on the morning of </p><p>October 9, riot police surrounded the home of Raymond </p><p>Majongwe, secretary-general of the PTUZ, who was not present, </p><p>and allegedly beat up Majongwe,s wife and housemaid and </p><p>harassed his 3-year-old and 5-year-old child in an attempt to </p><p>determine Majongwe,s whereabouts.  Majongwe subsequently </p><p>turned himself in to the police later the same morning, and </p><p>was eventually charged under a subsection of the Public Order </p><p>and Security Act (POSA) for "interfering with the rights of </p><p>others" by allegedly threatening teachers and headmasters who </p><p>refused to engage in the strike. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Majongwe detailed a chilling picture to colleagues at </p><p>the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) (strictly </p><p>protect).  Due to the increased scrutiny of labor groups by </p><p>the GOZ and a resulting distance between the Mission and </p><p>labor groups, this communication was received via the AFL-CIO </p><p>Solidarity Center (strictly protect).  According to </p><p>Majongwe,s account, after he was formally processed by the </p><p>police, he was questioned by several officers for </p><p>approximately two hours, and was eventually told that he </p><p>could leave without being charged.  He stated that as he was </p><p>heading toward the police station exit, he was intercepted </p><p>and "detained" by several men in plain clothes, whom he </p><p>assumed to be Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) </p><p>operatives, who attempted to divert him to another location. </p><p>Majongwe claimed that he had been warned by a police officer </p><p>that he would be killed if he left the police station, and he </p><p>interpreted the attempted diversion as a hostile move. </p><p>According to Majongwe, his understanding was that the police </p><p>would be able to say that he had been released and they had </p><p>no knowledge of his whereabouts, when in fact he had been </p><p>kidnapped and killed by the CIO.  Majongwe -- who is a very </p><p>large man -- then began to struggle with the plain-clothed </p><p>men and tried to force his way to the exit, dragging his </p><p>assailants with him.  While he did not have much hope of </p><p>escape, he did hope to draw attention to his presence and the </p><p>fact that he was being forcibly detained.  Fortunately for </p><p>Majongwe, a commuter bus was unloading passengers at the </p><p>entrance, and members of the public became witnesses to his </p><p>unequal struggle with his captors.  He stated that several </p><p>people recognized him and began to chant his name, which </p><p>ensured that the public knew that he remained in police </p><p>custody.  He was finally overpowered and moved to another </p><p>section of the police station, where he alleged that he was </p><p>beaten and tortured by the police and CIO for a period of </p><p>over four hours.  On October 10, Majongwe\'s attorney reported </p><p>that his client was incoherent, could hardly speak or stand, </p><p>and was suffering from suspected internal injuries including </p><p>broken ribs.  Majongwe was released on bail (remand) on </p><p>October 11. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Majongwe also told the ZCTU that the police had </p><p>confiscated from the PTUZ office a document which purportedly </p><p>connected the PTUZ with the USG.  Although there has been no </p><p>direct written contact between the Embassy and the PTUZ, </p><p>there have been communications (possibly including documents) </p><p>between USAID and the PTUZ in relation to allegations of </p><p>assault and abuse of teachers around the March presidential </p><p>elections by war vets, youth militias, and ZANU-PF </p><p>supporters.  Majongwe was certain that such a document would </p><p>be used as an excuse to paint the PTUZ as a group </p><p>"collaborating with the USG for the overthrow of the Mugabe </p><p>regime."  Given the GOZ\'s increased scrutiny of NGOs </p><p>perceived to be working with opposition elements, this </p><p>document -- if it exists -- could prove problematic. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  In a separate development, Majongwe was subsequently </p><p>re-arrested on Wednesday, October 16, after addressing a </p><p>group of teachers at a Harare high school.  Arrested at the </p><p>same time were the PTUZ national coordinator and the PTUZ </p><p>treasurer, who were later released.  Although Majongwe was </p><p>originally detained at Marlborough Police Station, officers </p><p>at that station stated that he had been transferred to Harare </p><p>Central Police Station on Thursday, October 17.  However, the </p><p>Harare Central Police Station would not confirm that Majongwe </p><p>was being held, and authorities clearly stalled in order to </p><p>hold Majongwe over the weekend.  The independent press </p><p>reports that Majongwe was tortured with electric shocks </p><p>applied to his mouth and genitals.  The press also reports </p><p>that the Attorney General declined to press new charges and </p><p>that Majongwe should finally get his bail hearing on October </p><p>21.  Majongwe\'s medical condition remains compromised due to </p><p>his mistreatment during his previous incarceration, and PTUZ </p><p>treasurer MacDonald Mangauzani is quoted as saying that they </p><p>"fear for his life." </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Other Labor Unrest </p><p>------------------ </p><p>9. (U)  Due to widespread economic and industrial problems, </p><p>labor unrest is predicted to increase during the remainder of </p><p>this year.  Lecturers at the University of Zimbabwe are </p><p>similarly engaged in a work stoppage (to be reported septel), </p><p>although the official response has been much lower profile. </p><p>The GOZ remains under constant scrutiny by various </p><p>international labor groups for the deteriorating situation of </p><p>labor unions as well as its response to the teachers\' strike. </p><p> The AFL-CIO reports that a labor delegation -- including </p><p>representatives from SATTUC, COSATU, and OATU -- is scheduled </p><p>to visit Zimbabwe during the next week.  The AFL-CIO is </p><p>disappointed that the delegation is scheduled to meet with </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and President Mugabe, in </p><p>addition to the Minister of Labor, as they feel that this </p><p>gives the Mugabe government another opportunity to co-opt the </p><p>dialogue and dilutes the value of the labor-to-labor </p><p>statement of solidarity. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  Comment.  One of the more sinister implications of </p><p>the GOZ\'s handling of the teachers\' strike is the coincidence </p><p>of the mandate that all students at teachers\' colleges now be </p><p>graduates of the "national service" training such as that </p><p>provided to the youth militias.  Teachers have been a prime </p><p>target for retaliation and harassment by war vets and youth </p><p>militias -- including humiliation, summary dismissal, </p><p>assault, injury, rape, and even murder -- on even the </p><p>faintest suspicion that they might harbor MDC sympathies.  At </p><p>least one commentator has openly speculated that firing the </p><p>striking teachers is paving the way for a new "chimurenga" </p><p>(revolution) in the educational system, whose resolution lies </p><p>in "fast-track" appointment of properly indoctrinated youth </p><p>militia members as full-scale teachers. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U)  Comment continued.  Regardless of the ultimate </p><p>outcome of this particular strike, the labor unrest in the </p><p>teachers\' ranks is symptomatic of the deterioration of the </p><p>situation of the average Zimbabwean worker.  Inflation has </p><p>risen to at least 139% (reftel), and the current parallel </p><p>exchange rate stands at 950:1, in stark contrast to the </p><p>official rate of 55:1.  The ZCTU has publicly warned of </p><p>"spontaneous reaction" by workers to the "harsh economic </p><p>climate."  Although this particular strike might not be the </p><p>spark that sets society alight, many observers are watching </p><p>the GOZ to see how it manages to contain a potentially </p><p>explosive situation.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
