<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002939 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 10/03/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA DECLINES TO SAY "YES" OR "NO" ON ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p>BUT IMPLIES "NO" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 169690  B) HARARE 2743  C) HARARE 2690 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN AN OCTOBER 2 MEETING WITH MFA EUROPE AND AMERICAS </p><p>DIVISION DIRECTOR JONATHAN WUTAWUNASHE, CHARGE, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF, REITERATED PREVIOUS EXPRESSIONS OF </p><p>CONCERN OVER THE GOZ\'S TREATMENT OF THE TEAM FROM THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR ELECTION SYSTEMS (IFES).  (N.B. THE </p><p>MEETING WAS A FOLLOW-UP TO A/S KANSTEINER\'S SEPTEMBER 27 </p><p>DISCUSSION IN WASHINGTON WITH AMBASSADOR MUBAKO -- REF A).  THE </p><p>CHARGE STRESSED THE USG\' S DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE IFES TEAM HAD </p><p>BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE AFTER IT HAD REQUESTED APPOINTMENTS WITH </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING ELECTIONS.  IFES </p><p>IS AN INTERNATIONALLY-RESPECTED ORGANIZATION THAT HAS OBSERVED </p><p>ELECTIONS WORLD-WIDE, AND THE USG STRONGLY ENDORSES ITS PROPOSED </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN ZIMBABWE.  THE CHARGE POINTED OUT THAT ASSESSMENTS </p><p>OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS FROM ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS IFES WOULD BE </p><p>CRUCIAL TO INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC PERCEPTIONS OF THE </p><p>LEGITIMACY OF THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  HE SAID HE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THAT IFES INTENDS TO SEND ANOTHER TEAM TO ZIMBABWE IN </p><p>MID-OCTOBER, AND WE REQUESTED A SIMPLE "YES" OR "NO" AS TO WHETHER </p><p>THEY WOULD BE WELCOME.  THE CHARGE STATED THAT WE WOULD INTERPRET </p><p>A LACK OF RESPONSE AS A "NO." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WUTAWUNASHE REPLIED THAT THE GOZ WAS "AT A GREAT </p><p>DISADVANTAGE" LAST TIME BECAUSE IT DID NOT KNOW THE IFES TEAM WAS </p><p>COMING.  HE SAID IT WOULD BE "PRUDENT" FOR ANYONE CONTEMPLATING A </p><p>VISIT TO A "SOVEREIGN COUNTRY" TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH THE </p><p>NECESSARY PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW.  THIS WAS NOT A VISIT THAT OUR TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS HAD DISCUSSED IN ADVANCE.  THE CHARGE ACKNOWLEDGED THE </p><p>POINT BUT NOTED THAT IFES IS AN NGO, IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02939  01 OF 02  031447Z </p><p>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, AND DID NOT REQUEST THE EMBASSY\'S </p><p>ASSISTANCE PRIOR TO ITS TEAM\'S VISIT IN EARLY SEPTEMBER. </p><p>WUTAWUNASHE SAID HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THE TEAM MEMBERS </p><p>HAD PUT ON THEIR VISA APPLICATIONS.  PERHAPS THEY WERE NOT HONEST </p><p>ABOUT THEIR INTENDED WORK IN ZIMBABWE, AND IT MIGHT HAVE LOOKED TO </p><p>IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS LIKE A "SURREPTITIOUS ENTRY." IMMIGRATION </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE THE SAME THE WORLD OVER, WUTAWUNASHE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE USG, THE CHARGE AFFIRMED, IS MORE INTERESTED IN </p><p>DETERMINING NEXT STEPS THAN IN REHASHING PAST DIFFICULTIES.  HE </p><p>REMINDED WUTAWUNASHE THAT SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT MNANGAGWA HAD </p><p>ASSURED US THAT INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS WOULD BE WELCOMED BECAUSE </p><p>THAT WAS A TRADITION IN ZIMBABWE. THE USG IS NOW REQUESTING A </p><p>SIMPLE "YES" OR "NO" ON WHETHER THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO WORK </p><p>UNHINDERED.  IN RESPONSE, WUTAWUNASHE STATED THAT HE WANTED THE </p><p>CHARGE TO UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY PREVAILING IN OFFICIAL CIRCLES </p><p>IN HARARE.  THERE IS A STRONG PERCEPTION AMONG MANY IN THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANTS TO </p><p>REMOVE PRESIDENT MUGABE.  THAT PERCEPTION, HE CONTINUED, HAD BEEN </p><p>STRENGTHENED BY RECENT CONFERENCES HELD IN WASHINGTON AND LONDON, </p><p>AT LEAST ONE ATTENDED BY FORMER A/S CHESTER CROCKER, WHERE </p><p>SCENARIOS WERE DISCUSSED ABOUT HOW MUGABE MIGHT BE CONVINCED OR </p><p>FORCED TO STEP DOWN.  WHY ARE AFRICAN COUNTRIES NOT BEATING DOWN </p><p>THE DOOR TO OBSERVE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, HE ASKED, WHILE </p><p>OTHER NATIONS ARE ANXIOUS TO SEND PEOPLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE?  "WE </p><p>DON\'T EVEN HAVE A DATE SET FOR THE ELECTION YET," WUTAWUNASHE </p><p>SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE EUROPE AND AMERICAS DIVISION DIRECTOR SAID HE HESITATED </p><p>TO PROVIDE A DEFINITIVE "YES" OR "NO" WITHOUT KNOWING MORE ABOUT </p><p>IFES.  NGOS, HE DECLARED, ARE A DIME A DOZEN AND ARE NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02939  01 OF 02  031447Z </p><p>CONSTRAINED BY DIPLOMATIC CONVENTIONS OR THE NEED TO MAINTAIN </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS.  FOR THAT REASON, HE PERSONALLY PREFERRED </p><p>OFFICIAL OBSERVERS SENT BY GOVERNMENTS.  THE CHARGE REITERATED </p><p>THAT IFES HAS AN OUTSTANDING INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION FOR </p><p>CREDIBILITY, NON-PARTISANSHIP, AND ELECTION-RELATED EXPERTISE.  HE </p><p>CLARIFIED THAT IFES INITIALLY INTENDS TO CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>THE ELECTORAL ENVIRONMENT AND WILL THEN DETERMINE WHETHER IT WANTS </p><p>TO BECOME INVOLVED IN AN OBSERVATION EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WUTAWUNASHE AFFIRMED THAT THE GOZ WAS OPERATING "UNDER THE </p><p>SPIRIT OF THE ABUJA AGREEMENT," ACCORDING TO WHICH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD RESPOND TO GOZ REQUESTS FOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE WITH ITS ELECTORAL PROCESS.  THE GOZ TOOK THE ABUJA </p><p>AGREEMENT SERIOUSLY, WUTAWUNASHE INSISTED, AND WOULD ISSUE </p><p>INVITATIONS "AT THE RIGHT TIME."  IN THE MEANTIME, HE SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT GROUPS INTERESTED IN OBSERVING MAKE THE GOZ AWARE OF THAT </p><p>INTEREST.  SHOULD IFES APPROACH THE ZIMBABWEAN EMBASSY IN </p><p>WASHINGTON TO VERIFY ITS BONA FIDES, THE CHARGE ASKED?  YES, </p><p>WUTAWUNASHE RESPONDED, THEY SHOULD PROBABLY INTRODUCE THEMSELVES </p><p>TO THE EMBASSY AND EXPRESS THEIR INTEREST IN OBSERVING THE </p><p>ELECTION "WHEN THAT TIME COMES." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0006 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02939  02 OF 02  031447Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------2926AA  031447Z /45 </p><p>O 031324Z OCT 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9874 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002939 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 10/03/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA DECLINES TO SAY "YES" OR "NO" ON ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p>BUT IMPLIES "NO" </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02939  02 OF 02  031447Z </p><p>6.  (C) WUTAWUNASHE\'S REMARKS SUGGEST THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS VERY UNLIKELY TO PROVIDE, ANY TIME SOON, A CLEAR-CUT </p><p>"YES" OR "NO" ON THE ISSUE OF INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS. </p><p>HE IS RIGHT ABOUT THE PARANOIA REIGNING IN ZANU-PF\'S INNER CIRCLE, </p><p>WHERE MANY SENIOR OFFICIALS ARE GENUINELY CONVINCED THAT SOME </p><p>WESTERN GOVERNMENTS (INCLUDING THE U.S.) ARE USING NGOS AS A FRONT </p><p>TO WORK FULL-OUT FOR THE DEFEAT OF MUGABE AND THE RULING PARTY. </p><p>AS A RESULT, THE GOZ HAS CLEARLY GONE INTO STALL MODE, AND WILL </p><p>USE THE ABUJA AGREEMENT TO CLOAK ITS RELUCTANCE TO ADMIT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT IF INVITATIONS ARE </p><p>ISSUED TO IFES AND SIMILAR GROUPS, IT WILL BE DONE ONLY AT THE </p><p>VERY LAST MINUTE, IN THE FIVE- TO EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD IN WHICH BY </p><p>REGULATION THE GOZ MUST ANNOUNCE ELECTIONS, AND TOO LATE FOR </p><p>OBSERVERS TO ASSESS FIRST-HAND THE DAMAGE DONE BY ZANU-PF\'S PRE- </p><p>ELECTION ANTICS.  WUTAWUNASHE FAITHFULLY CONVEYED THE GOZ AND </p><p>RULING PARTY THINKING THAT THE WEST AND NGOS ARE NOT OBJECTIVE </p><p>OBSERVERS OF ZIMBABWE\'S POLITICAL SCENE, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR </p><p>THAT HE PERSONALLY SHARES THIS VIEW. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
