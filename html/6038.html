<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000578 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EINV, SENV, CA, AA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA\'S ACTION ON ASIA PULP AND PAPER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) JAKARTA 2431 </p><p> </p><p>     B. B) OTTAWA 484 </p><p>     C. C) STATE 44188 </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (SBU)  On February 28 Finoff touched base with Canada\'s </p><p>Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) for an update on GOC </p><p>action with regard to proposals on Asia Pulp and Paper </p><p>restructuring.  The joint letter to President Megawati to be </p><p>drafted by the Canadian Embassy in Jakarta (ref A) has been </p><p>cleared in Ottawa and is being circulated among the </p><p>participating embassys in Jakarta.  The GOC hopes to have the </p><p>clearance process completed by early next week, but </p><p>understands there are likely to be changes to the text. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The possibility of calling in Indonesia\'s </p><p>ambassador to Ottawa to protest handling of the case is under </p><p>consideration, but a final decision has not been made. </p><p>According to DFAIT, the GOC "might go that route." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The Export Development Corporation, Canada\'s ECA, </p><p>said that they are "not that strongly contemplating" a firm </p><p>decision to take private corporations off cover and are not </p><p>planning to put anything in writing.  He added that he </p><p>believes, speaking generally, that most ECAs are reluctant to </p><p>draw a line in the sand that continues for an indefinite </p><p>period.  "Actions speak," and they are not thinking of doing </p><p>anything publicly.  EDC believes the next step is the letter </p><p>to President Megawati, and they\'ll see what happens after </p><p>that. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Comment: Today\'s conversations in Ottawa confirm </p><p>the view (Ref B) that GOC action and decision making on this </p><p>issue are driven by the Canadian Embassy in Jakarta.  EDC </p><p>does not have a presence in Jakarta and DFAIT appears to be </p><p>relying on the Ambassador\'s judgment.  EDC, which operates as </p><p>a private company, showed the hesitation about discussing </p><p>proprietary matters that would be expected of a banker </p><p>talking about a client. There seems to be a strong </p><p>inclination on the part of the GOC to await the response to </p><p>the joint letter to Megawati before moving on to other steps. </p><p> End comment. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
