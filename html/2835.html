<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000838 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, ASEC, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NORMALCY RETURNS AFTER FIVE-DAY STRIKE; MAOISTS </p><p>DECLARE STRIKE A SUCCESS, CRITICIZE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) KATHMANDU 828, B) KATHMANDU 813, C) KATHMANDU 804 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Normalcy returned to Nepal\'s capital </p><p>April 28 after a five-day general strike called by Maoist </p><p>insurgents ended the day before.  On the strike\'s last day </p><p>scattered violent incidents were reported in the Kathmandu </p><p>Valley, including the deaths of three Maoists who had </p><p>tried to stop traffic on a suburban road.  Also on April </p><p>27, in Khotang district after at least 12 Maoists were </p><p>killed in an encounter with security forces, the </p><p>insurgents retaliated by attacking an airport tower in the </p><p>district.  In three recent statements, Maoist leaders </p><p>Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai declared the general </p><p>strike a success; complained of the bounty put on the </p><p>heads of Maoist leaders; and criticized U.S. and foreign </p><p>involvement in Nepal.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Strike Over, Normalcy Returns </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Life returned to normal in Kathmandu April 28 after </p><p>a five-day Maoist-declared general strike shut down many </p><p>businesses and nearly all long-distance transport April 23- </p><p>27.  Many larger stores in the capital opened tentatively </p><p>April 27, although traffic remained light.  According to </p><p>media reports, in Kathmandu a few scattered attacks on </p><p>vehicles occurred and two bombs were defused by police. </p><p>Three Maoists were killed after they tried to block </p><p>traffic on a road south-west of the capital, a Defense </p><p>Ministry press release said. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Retaliate by Destroying Airport Tower </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) On April 27, the last day of the general strike, </p><p>"at least 12" Maoists died in clashes with security forces </p><p>in Khotang district, about 90 miles southeast of </p><p>Kathmandu, according to a Defense Ministry press release. </p><p>The 12 Maoists were killed after they encountered security </p><p>forces on a remote trail four hours walk east of the </p><p>district headquarters.  Initial news reports stated that </p><p>22 Maoists died in the operation; the exact number of </p><p>casualties is unknown.  Maoists retaliated by destroying </p><p>the airport tower at Lamidanda in Khotang during the early </p><p>morning hours of April 29.  A team of civil air officials </p><p>who inspected the site confirmed the incident to a </p><p>Kathmandu journalist. </p><p> </p><p>New Maoist Press Releases Criticize Bounty, U.S. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) In press releases dated April 25 and April 27, </p><p>Maoist leaders Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai complained </p><p>about the government\'s offer of a reward for top Maoist </p><p>leaders and U.S. involvement in Nepal.  Prachanda\'s April </p><p>25 statement accused Nepal\'s leaders of plotting "to hand </p><p>over the entire country to the American imperialists," and </p><p>asserted that the government\'s offer of a reward for </p><p>Maoist leaders "will never be successful." </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Declare Strike "Success" </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In an April 27 statement, Baburam Bhattarai, </p><p>writing as "Coordinator, United Revolutionary People\'s </p><p>Council, Nepal," thanked all those who made the April 23- </p><p>27 general strike a "grand success."  Battarai also </p><p>complained about Nepal\'s leaders offering a reward for </p><p>high-level Maoists, and "trying to invite foreign powers </p><p>along with America for military intervention causing great </p><p>danger to the country\'s sovereignty.  In his own April 27 </p><p>statement, Prachanda also labeled the general strike as </p><p>"successful" and criticized the government\'s plans to </p><p>involve "foreign devils" in its struggle with the </p><p>insurgents. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Post obtained Nepali-language versions of the </p><p>Maoist leaders\' three statements late in the day April 29. </p><p>Post will send its own full translations to SA/INS April </p><p>30. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) That the Maoist general strike was not a clear </p><p>success was obvious to all Nepalese, Maoist assertions to </p><p>the contrary not withstanding.  Scattered acts of Maoist </p><p>violence did not succeed in cowing most urbanites, and the </p><p>strike was widely flaunted in most cities and the larger </p><p>towns.  The Maoists now refer to the U.S. and other </p><p>unspecified foreign powers with increasing frequency. </p><p>However, in their statements the Maoists seem to take at </p><p>least as much umbrage to the prices put on their heads as </p><p>to reports of U.S. involvement.  With another Maoist- </p><p>declared strike behind them, many Nepalese have already </p><p>begun to hear rumors of the next strike. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
