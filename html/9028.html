<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001677 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/CCA, PRM/A, EUR/UBI. </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CU, NL, PHUM, PREL, PREF, PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON DUTCH DEPORTATION OF CUBAN ASYLUM </p><p>APPLICANT ON JUNE 30 </p><p> </p><p>REF: THE HAGUE 01627 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Counselor Mary E. Daly for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request. See para 6. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In discussions with the attorney, Mw. mr. W.M. Hompe, </p><p>who is representing Cuban asylum applicant Jose Manuel Vargas </p><p>Martin, PolOff was informed that no appeal had been filed </p><p>after the original denial of asylum.  Vargas Martin was </p><p>represented by a different counsel during the initial asylum </p><p>hearing, and Hompe does not know the reasons the other </p><p>counsel did not file an appeal.  Hompe said that during the </p><p>asylum hearing, Vargas Martin based his asylum claim </p><p>primarily on the economic conditions in Cuba and only talked </p><p>of his possible detention in Cuba after he was told he would </p><p>be deported to Cuba if he were denied asylum.  Since no </p><p>appeal was filed, under the Dutch Aliens Act, Vargas Martin </p><p>is obliged to leave the country. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In a letter dated June 25, the Dutch Immigration and </p><p>Naturalization Service (IND) informed Hompe that they had </p><p>instructed Vargas Martin to surrender his passport to prepare </p><p>for deportation proceedings.  Vargas Martin\'s relatives had </p><p>requested that he be allowed to travel independently to </p><p>either Costa Rica or the United States.  The IND said that </p><p>was not possible unless he received a valid visa and a letter </p><p>of confirmation that the third country would allow him entry. </p><p> Such documents must be submitted to the IND by July 1 or he </p><p>will be deported to Cuba. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Vargas Martin, who is married to a Lebanese woman, </p><p>was in transit from Lebanon to Cuba when he requested asylum </p><p>in The Netherlands.  Vargas Martin\'s wife returned to Cuba </p><p>and did not apply for asylum.  Hompe requested that IND allow </p><p>Vargas Martin to travel to Lebanon upon deportation; however, </p><p>the IND said that since he did not have the proper travel </p><p>documents to return to Lebanon, they must deny his request. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Vargas Martin has an aunt living in Miami who is </p><p>coordinating his visa requests.  He is waiting for a response </p><p>to his request for a visa to Costa Rica.  He also has family </p><p>in the Dominican Republic and may try to obtain a visa there. </p><p> At least two members of Vargas Martin\'s family in the United </p><p>States have requested assistance from various USG and other </p><p>government officials, resulting in numerous letters and phone </p><p>calls requesting intervention to prevent his deportation to </p><p>Cuba. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to Hompe, the only option available to </p><p>Vargas Martin to avoid deportation on either June 30 or July </p><p>1, is to request another delay of his deportation by COB June </p><p>27.  She said that such a request from her would likely fail, </p><p>but one from the USG would have a better chance of </p><p>succeeding.  Embassy The Hague requests immediate guidance on </p><p>this case as to whether we should approach the Dutch </p><p>authorities to request another delay of his deportation. </p><p>Please also advise what, if any, alternative recourse may be </p><p>available in the United States. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
