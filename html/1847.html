<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001878 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND PRM </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PGOV, PREL, PHUM, VM, UNHCR, ETMIN, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM DENIES UNHCR ACCESS TO HIGHLANDS </p><p> </p><p>REF: PHNOM PENH 1267 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01878  01 OF 03  061044Z </p><p>1. VIETNAM HAS DENIED UNHCR ACCESS TO CENTRAL HIGHLAND </p><p>PROVINCES, PREVENTING UNHCR FROM LAUNCHING VOLUNTARY </p><p>REPATRIATION OF HIGHLANDS RESIDENTS WHO HAVE FLED TO </p><p>CAMBODIA.  UNHCR WILL NOW CONSIDER LONGER-TERM MEASURES FOR </p><p>THE DISPLACED POPULATIONS IN RATTANAKIRI AND MONDOLAKIRI. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. ON JULY 27, UN HIGH COMMISSION FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR) </p><p>REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE JAHANSHAH ASSADI TOLD FOREIGN </p><p>EMBASSY REPRESENTATIVES IN HANOI THAT VIETNAM HAD REFUSED </p><p>UNHCR EVEN LIMITED ACCESS TO VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS IN </p><p>ADVANCE OF PROPOSED VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION OF VIETNAMESE WHO </p><p>HAVE FLED TO CAMBODIA SINCE DISTURBANCES EARLIER IN THE </p><p>YEAR.  DURING JUST-COMPLETED TRIPARTITE TALKS WITH VIETNAM </p><p>AND CAMBODIA, IN A DRAFT AGREEMENT VIETNAM AGREED TO ALLOW </p><p>UNHCR ACCESS TO RETURNEES AFTER THEIR RETURN, BUT UNHCR </p><p>WOULD REQUIRE ACCESS TO FIRST SURVEY THE HOME AREAS OF THOSE </p><p>WHO FLED, THEN TO MONITOR THEIR TREATMENT UPON THEIR RETURN, </p><p>BEFORE LAUNCHING A VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION PROGRAM.  IT WAS </p><p>UNCLEAR WHETHER VIETNAM WOULD ALLOW UNCHR TO ACCOMPANY </p><p>RETURNEES FROM CAMBODIA TO VIETNAM.  UNHCR HAD BEEN </p><p>"FLEXIBLE", SUGGESTING VISITS TO CERTAIN, "EASIER" AREAS </p><p>FIRST, AT A TIME TO BE CHOSEN BY THE VIETNAMESE, BUT STILL </p><p>HAD NO SUCCESS IN GETTING HANOI\'S APPROVAL FOR THESE STEPS. </p><p> </p><p>3. AS A RESULT, UNHCR MAY NOW HAVE TO REVISE ITS PLANNING IN </p><p>CAMBODIA, SHIFTING FROM SHORT-TERM MEASURES TO PROVIDE FOOD </p><p>AND SHELTER TO THE DISPLACED PERSONS, TO LONGER-TERM </p><p>MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>4. ASKED TO SPECULATE WHY VIETNAM DENIED ACCESS, ASSADI SAID </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01878  01 OF 03  061044Z </p><p>HE GUESSED THERE WERE REAL PROBLEMS IN SOME AREAS, AND THAT </p><p>ALLOWING UNHCR IN COULD BE SEEN AS INTERNATIONALIZING A </p><p>LOCAL SITUATION.  HE OBSERVED THAT THE INTERAGENCY </p><p>VIETNAMESE DELEGATION TO THE TRIPARTITE TALKS HAD </p><p>DEMONSTRATED SOME DIVISION OF OPINION; HE FELT THE </p><p>OBJECTIONS HAD COME FROM THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY, </p><p>WHILE THE MFA DID NOT APPEAR TO POSE PROBLEMS WITH THE UNHCR </p><p>PROPOSALS.  ASSADI SAID HE HAD NOT OBSERVED THE CAMBODIANS </p><p>PRESSING THE VIETNAMESE TO BE FLEXIBLE ON THE QUESTION OF </p><p>ACCESS FOR THE UNHCR.  HE CHARACTERIZED THE CAMBODIANS AS </p><p>BEING LARGELY QUIESCENT IN THE DISCUSSIONS BUT FELT THAT ALL </p><p>PARTICIPANTS HAD BEEN FRANK IN THEIR COMMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. ASSADI SAID UNHCR WAS CONCERNED THAT THIS OUTCOME OF THE </p><p>TRIPARTITE TALKS COULD STIMULATE NEW DEPARTURES FROM </p><p>VIETNAM, AS INDIVIDUALS IN VIETNAM CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT </p><p>THEY WOULD NOT IMMEDIATELY BE RETURNED HOME IF THEY MADE IT </p><p>TO CAMBODIA.  UNTIL THIS POINT, ASSADI BELIEVES, THE FACT </p><p>THERE WERE TALKS ABOUT A POTENTIAL VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION </p><p>PROGRAM MAY HAVE DISCOURAGED SOME DEPARTURES FOR CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>6. DESPITE THE DENIAL OF ACCESS, ASSADI SAID POSITIVE </p><p>OUTCOMES OF THE TRIPARTITE TALKS INCLUDED THE FACT THAT THEY </p><p>TOOK PLACE AT ALL; THAT THE TWO GOVERNMENTS ACKNOWLEDGED A </p><p>UNHCR ROLE; THAT ALL PARTICIPANTS AGREED TO REMAIN IN </p><p>COMMUNICATION ON THE ISSUES; AND THAT VIETNAM ALLOWED THE </p><p>MEETING TO TAKE PLACE IN VIETNAM.  ASSADI FELT UNCHR MAY </p><p>HAVE ENHANCED ITS CREDIBILITY WITH THE TWO GOVERNMENTS BY </p><p>DEMONSTRATING COMMITMENT TO SOLUTIONS AND NOT ONLY TO </p><p>PROTECTION OF DISPLACED PERSONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01878  01 OF 03  061044Z </p><p>7. ASSADI REPORTED THAT THE PREVIOUS ROUND OF TRIPARTITE </p><p>TALKS HAD RESULTED IN A NON-PAPER OUTLINING AN AGREED </p><p>FRAMEWORK FOR REPATRIATION.  THE FRAMEWORK WOULD ALLOW UNHCR </p><p>TO PROVIDE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT, REINTEGRATION ASSISTANCE FOR </p><p>RETURNEES AND ASSISTANCE TO AFFECTED COMMUNITIES, TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE REPATRIATION.  BASED ON THE NON-PAPER, UNHCR HAD THOUGHT </p><p>IT WAS NEAR SECURING AGREEMENT ON ACCESS. </p><p> </p><p>8. ASSADI ACKNOWLEDGED CRITICISM OF UNHCR\'S APPROACH TO THE </p><p>CURRENT POPULATION OF DISPLACED VIETNAMESE IN CAMBODIA. </p><p>(CRITICS ARGUED THE UNHCR WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE GRANTED </p><p>ACCESS TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, AND SO SHOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>PROCEEDED WITH SCREENING OF THESE PEOPLE FOR REFUGEE </p><p>STATUS.)  THERE ARE 315 "PERSONS OF CONCERN" PRESENTLY IN </p><p>CAMBODIA, ASSADI REPORTED, OF WHICH 60 ARE IN RATTANAKIRI </p><p>AND THE REST IN MONDOLKIRI.  SOME 70-80 HAVE BEEN SCREENED </p><p>OUT, DESPITE UNHCR\'S HAVING APPLIED LIBERAL CRITERIA AND </p><p>GIVEN APPLICANTS FOR REFUGEE STATUS BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. </p><p>HE STATED UNHCR IS NEITHER TRYING TO KEEP NUMBERS OF PERSONS </p><p>GRANTED REFUGEE STATUS LOW, NOR APPLYING POLITICAL CRITERIA </p><p>TO THE CASELOAD.  THAT SAID, HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CRITICS </p><p>ARGUE UNHCR CANNOT KNOW THE SITUATION IN THE HOME REGIONS OF </p><p>THE APPLICANTS AND SO CANNOT REALISTICALLY ADJUDICATE </p><p>APPLICATIONS.  (AS RECENT REFTELS FROM PHNOM PENH INDICATE, </p><p>THE UNHCR HAS APPARENTLY AGREED TO RE-EXAMINE THE CASES AND </p><p>NOT SIMPLY ASSUME THESE PEOPLE WILL OR SHOULD GO BACK TO </p><p>VIETNAM NOW.) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01878  02 OF 03  061044Z </p><p> </p><p>9. ASSADI SAID THAT APPLICANTS ARE SCREENED ON A ROLLING </p><p>BASIS.  MOST OF THESE SCREENED-OUT IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE </p><p>CAMPS IN CAMBODIA ON THEIR OWN.  UNHCR NEITHER COUNSELS THEM </p><p>ABOUT RETURNING TO VIETNAM NOR ASKS THEM WHERE THEY PLAN TO </p><p>GO, DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF CAMBODIAN OFFICIALS AT </p><p>INTERVIEWS.  AND, AS FAR AS THE UNHCR KNEW, NONE WERE </p><p>IMMEDIATELY ROUNDED UP BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  ASSADI </p><p>SPECULATED MOST WOULD SIMPLY FADE INTO THE HOUSES OF FRIENDS </p><p>AND/OR THE JUNGLES. </p><p> </p><p>10. ASSADI REPORTED THAT THE PROFILE OF NEW ARRIVALS FROM </p><p>VIETNAM CONTINUES TO INCLUDE BOTH MORE POLITICIZED </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND PEASANTS.  SEVENTY PERCENT ARE MALE. </p><p>RATTANAKIRI HAS 55 MEN AND SEVEN WOMEN, ALL BUT SIX FROM GIA </p><p>LAI, ESPECIALLY CHU PA DISTRICT; THE OTHER SIX ARE FROM DAK </p><p>LAK.  MONDOLKIRI HAS 179 MEN, 72 WOMEN, ALL FROM DAK LAK, </p><p>ESPECIALLY BAN ME THUOT, DAK MIL AND DAK MONG DISTRICTS, </p><p>EXCEPT FOUR PEOPLE FROM GIA LAI AND TWO FROM LAM DONG.  BOTH </p><p>CAMPS HAVE A MIX OF FAMILIES AND SINGLE MALES. </p><p> </p><p>11. ASKED WHAT THE ATTITUDE OF THE DISPLACED PERSONS WAS </p><p>TOWARDS VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION, ASSADI\'S FIELD STAFF FROM </p><p>CAMBODIA REPORTED THAT NO ONE AT EITHER RATTANAKIRI NOR </p><p>MONDOLKIRI WAS INTERESTED IN BEING RESETTLED IN A THIRD </p><p>COUNTRY.  MORE RECENTLY, CAMP RESIDENTS HAVE BEGUN TO </p><p>MENTION HAVING RELATIVES ABROAD, BUT NONE APPEARS FOCUSED ON </p><p>LEAVING TO JOIN THEM.  THE OTHER STAFFER CONCURRED WITH THAT </p><p>FINDING, ON THE BASIS OF HAVING MET ALL THE CAMP RESIDENTS </p><p>DURING MORE THAN TWO WEEKS IN BOTH FACILITIES.  RESIDENTS DO </p><p>NOT SEEK RESETTLEMENT, HE SAID, FOR IT WOULD MEAN NEVER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01878  02 OF 03  061044Z </p><p>AGAIN HAVING CONTACT WITH FAMILY LEFT BEHIND, AND LOSING </p><p>THEIR IDENTITY.  HE SAID HE BELIEVED MOST RESIDENTS WOULD </p><p>CONSIDER VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION IF UNHCR WERE FIRST ABLE TO </p><p>VISIT THEIR HOME AREAS.  THE RESIDENTS HE MET HAD LEFT </p><p>VIETNAM TO LET THE WORLD KNOW ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, HE SAID, BUT WANTED TO RETURN TO THEIR </p><p>HOMES. </p><p> </p><p>12. ASKED WHAT UNHCR\'S NEXT STEPS WOULD BE, ASSADI REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE AGENCY WOULD ADJUST ITS CAMBODIA SCOPE OF WORK </p><p>TOWARDS A LONGER-TERM FOCUS.  CONCERNS WOULD ARISE ABOUT </p><p>THIS APPROACH RESULTING IN "INSTITUTIONALIZATION" OF THE </p><p>SITUATION, AND THE CREATION OF QUASI-PERMANENT CAMPS, </p><p>SOMETHING BOTH THE CAMBODIANS AND VIETNAMESE APPEARED AT THE </p><p>TRIPARTITE TALKS TO WANT TO AVOID. </p><p> </p><p>13. CHARGE ASKED FOR ASSADI\'S COMMENT ON REPORTS THAT THERE </p><p>ARE MORE INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS AS WELL AS DISPLACED </p><p>PERSON IN CAMBODIA BEYOND THE ONES WHO HAD SOUGHT UNHCR\'S </p><p>HELP.  ASSADI\'S STAFF ANSWERED THAT, WHILE CITING ANY SET </p><p>NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION WOULD BE SPECULATION, THE </p><p>NUMBER WHO HAVE LEFT HOME IN VIETNAM CERTAINLY IS LARGER </p><p>THAN THE NUMBER WHO HAVE APPROACHED UNHCR.  WHILE PERSONS OF </p><p>CONCERN TO UNHCR HAVE MENTIONED OTHER SMALL GROUPS THAT HAVE </p><p>LEFT VIETNAM, UNHCR HAS NO REPORTS OF LARGER NUMBERS. </p><p>GENERALLY, UNHCR HEARS OF NEW DEPARTURES WITHIN A WEEK OF </p><p>THEIR ARRIVAL IN CAMBODIA, THEY SAID. </p><p> </p><p>14. CHARGE INFORMED THE GROUP ABOUT AMBASSADOR PETERSON\'S </p><p>EARLY-JULY VISIT TO THE HIGHLANDS, DURING WHICH AUTHORITIES </p><p>BLOCKED HIM FROM VISITING GIA LAI.  THE AMBASSADOR HAD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01878  02 OF 03  061044Z </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT RELIGION WAS NOT A FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE OF THE </p><p>DISTURBANCES, THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM APPEARED TO </p><p>RECOGNIZE THE REAL PROBLEMS AND LONG NEGLECT OF THE AREA IN </p><p>BOTH DAK LAK AND LAM DONG PROVINCES BUT NOT IN GIA LAI. </p><p> </p><p>15. ASSADI REPORTED THAT THE VIETNAMESE DELEGATION TO THE </p><p>TRIPARTITE TALKS HAD GONE TO LENGTHS TO ENSURE THE DRAFT </p><p>TEXT OF THE AGREEMENT REFLECTED THEIR GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS </p><p>TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION IN THE HIGHLANDS.  THEY ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED GRATITUDE FOR UNHCR\'S WILLINGNESS TO HELP.  CHARGE </p><p>NOTED THAT, DURING THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS, THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY OF VIETNAM HAD REMOVED OFFICIALS WHO HAD NOT DEALT </p><p>EFFECTIVELY WITH PROBLEMS IN MINORITY AREAS AND THAT A </p><p>RECENTLY HELD REGIONAL SESSION IN THE HIGHLANDS HAD BEEN </p><p>FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>16. ASKED TO COMMENT ON A RECENT HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH PRESS </p><p>RELEASE ON THE SITUATION IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, ASSADI </p><p>SAID THE ONE NEW ELEMENT IN THE STATEMENT WAS A CALL ON </p><p>UNHCR TO END SCREENING OUT APPLICANTS.  ASSADI REPEATED THAT </p><p>UNHCR WAS EMPLOYING A VERY LOW THRESHOLD IN SCREENING FOR </p><p>PERSONS OF CONCERN AND FOR REFUGEES.  THAT SAID, HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE SCREENING PROCESS </p><p>REQUIRED THAT THE PROCESS NOT BE WIDE OPEN.  UNHCR HAS NO </p><p>INFORMATION THAT SCREENED-OUT INDIVIDUALS FACE PROBLEMS UPON </p><p>RETURN TO VIETNAM.  THE AGENCY WOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY ANY </p><p>SUCH EVIDENCE AND QUICKLY ADJUST ITS PROCEDURES IF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01878  03 OF 03  061044Z </p><p>WARRANTED, ASSADI CONCLUDED.  BASED ON REFTEL HE APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE OPTED TO STOP THE SCREENING PROCESS UNTIL THE OPTIONS </p><p>ARE MORE CLEAR ON WHAT RETURN TO VIETNAM IS LIKELY TO MEAN. </p><p> </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
