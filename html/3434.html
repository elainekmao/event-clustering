(C) Summary.  Despite President Mugabe\'s vigorous </p><p>insistence that "devaluation is dead" (see reftel), the GOZ </p><p>has tacitly conceded -- within a matter of days -- that </p><p>devaluation is in fact very much alive.  On July 25, Finance </p><p>Minister Simba Makoni (who was obliquely castigated by Mugabe </p><p>in the same speech as a "saboteur" and "enemy of the </p><p>government" for advocating devaluation of the Zim dollar, see </p><p>reftel) announced new pricing structures for both tobacco and </p><p>duty calculated on imported luxury goods.  While the official </p><p>exchange rate continues to be pegged to the US dollar at </p><p>55:1, the newly-announced "viability price" for tobacco </p><p>mandates payment to tobacco growers of Zim $317 per kilo of </p><p>tobacco, which is a de facto devaluation to 158.5:1. </p><p>Additionally, for customs/duty purposes, the valuation of </p><p>luxury import goods will be calculated at 300:1.  These new </p><p>calculations join the existing exchange differentials which </p><p>benefit gold producers, exporters, and the tourism industry, </p><p>among others.  In actuality, all imports -- with the </p><p>exception of fuel and energy -- are the beneficiaries of </p><p>targeted devaluation.  While he is adamantly refusing to </p><p>devalue the Zim dollar across the board, Mugabe has allowed </p><p>the creation of a patchwork monetary policy where the </p><p>exception is rapidly becoming the rule.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Gold </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Gold mining was one of the first sectors to benefit </p><p>from a differential price structure.  By law, all Zimbabwean </p><p>gold must be sold to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), </p><p>which sells the gold to the world market based on US dollar </p><p>prices.  Initially, the RBZ paid the producers in Zim </p><p>dollars, until the rising discrepancy beginning in mid-2000 </p><p>between the official exchange rate and the parallel market </p><p>rate rendered this unworkable.  Gold producers complained </p><p>about their inability to import necessary equipment, such as </p><p>machinery, spare parts, and explosives, based on </p><p>profitability calculated at the official exchange rate.  In </p><p>response, the GOZ initiated the "support price structure" for </p><p>the industry, which pays the producers on an 80/20 split. </p><p>Eighty percent of the purchase price is paid out in Zim </p><p>dollars based on a premium determined by the RBS (e.g., the </p><p>US dollar price for gold), which works out to approximately </p><p>126:1.  The other 20% is paid out in forex, resulting in a </p><p>"blend rate" of about 170:1. </p><p> </p><p>Exports </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Industries which produce for export, and therefore </p><p>generate forex, were the next beneficiaries of differential </p><p>price structures.  Exporters are allowed to maintain Foreign </p><p>Currency Accounts (FCAs), which pay out 40% of an exporter\'s </p><p>income at the official 55:1 rate, but allow the exporters to </p><p>retain 60% of their income in forex -- provided that they </p><p>spend that forex within the next sixty days.  This ostensibly </p><p>provides a pool of forex for export companies to fund their </p><p>necessary inputs, capital improvements, equipment costs, and </p><p>other capital expenses which require forex payments.   If a </p><p>company does not spend its forex within sixty days, the </p><p>remaining funds are subject to "forced conversion" and the </p><p>exporter receives the equivalent in Zim dollars changed at </p><p>the official 55:1 rate.  In essence, for the first 40% of an </p><p>exporter\'s earnings as well as any of the 60% of forex funds </p><p>not turned around within the mandated time, at the current </p><p>parallel rate of 690:1, the RBZ -- and thus the GOZ -- keeps </p><p>Zim $635 for each US $1 earned. </p><p> </p><p>Non-Governmental Organizations / Embassies </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and foreign </p><p>embassies are also beneficiaries of special treatment.  NGOs </p><p>and foreign embassies are allowed to bring in forex which is </p><p>not subject to forced conversion IF they are 100 percent </p><p>funded from outside Zimbabwe.  If the NGOs, particularly, are </p><p>partly funded from local sources, they are subject to the </p><p>same regulations, including the 60/40 split, described above </p><p>for exporters. </p><p>Export Processing Zone Enterprises </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Export processing zone (EPZ) enterprises, which are </p><p>specially-designated companies that export at least 80% of </p><p>their product, are able to retain 100% of any forex they earn </p><p>without the sixty-day time limit.  This category almost </p><p>exclusively comprises new companies which have existing </p><p>markets in foreign countries; of the one hundred or so </p><p>companies which qualified for this status, very few were </p><p>existing companies which earned reclassification. </p><p>Essentially, these companies are able to retain their forex </p><p>until they want to use it. </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabweans / Foreigners with Outside Resources </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Zimbabweans who legitimately have access to outside </p><p>sources of forex, such as those with relatives working in </p><p>Britain, are not yet subject to any forced conversion to Zim </p><p>dollars (although such has been advocated in some circles, </p><p>see reftel).  Additionally, foreign investors with capital -- </p><p>e.g., those investing in money markets -- are free to keep </p><p>their forex or exchange it on the parallel market, for the </p><p>moment.  If parallel market sources such as bureaux de change </p><p>are shut down or become more heavily regulated, this will </p><p>limit to some degree the freedom of these individuals to </p><p>benefit from the true value of their resources, although </p><p>predictably we would expect a black market to emerge and </p><p>handle much of this volume. </p><p> </p><p>Tourism </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Tourist operators have long had a multi-tier pricing </p><p>structure, which (while not technically a devaluation) </p><p>certainly qualifies as a differential price structure.  The </p><p>first three tiers separate prices according to whether </p><p>visitors are international, regional, or domestic.  In </p><p>contrast to international visitors, who must pay a higher </p><p>rate -- in forex hard currency or via forex-based credit </p><p>cards -- Zimbabwean residents pay a nominal rate in Zim </p><p>dollars.  For instance, the official price for a double room </p><p>at the Miekles hotel in Harare is US $ 140 in hard cash for </p><p>an international visitor (which translates to Zim $ 96,600 at </p><p>the parallel rate), while a Zimbabwean resident pays Zim </p><p>$17,000 (or US $24.64 at the parallel rate).  Similar pricing </p><p>structures pertain at other local establishments, including </p><p>Victoria Falls and various game reserves. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Further, there is a fourth tier, unofficially termed </p><p>the "Tourism Exchange Rate," which qualifies as outright </p><p>devaluation.  This is the rate at which tour operators who </p><p>get paid in international funds remit payments to hotel </p><p>operators who are paid in Zim dollars.  This rate, while not </p><p>officially sanctioned by the GOZ, has been in operation for </p><p>approximately the past ten months.  To determine the Tourism </p><p>Exchange Rate, a prominent local economist contacts four </p><p>parallel market forex dealers and ascertains the rate of the </p><p>last deal of each, averages those four rates, and calculates </p><p>60% of the average.  The tour operators then use this rate to </p><p>remit payments to the hotel operators.  This economist has </p><p>been determining the Tourism Exchange Rate on a weekly basis </p><p>for application to transactions completed during the </p><p>following week, with the most recent value computed at 438:1. </p><p> </p><p>Tobacco </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) At the beginning of the current tobacco sales season </p><p>the GOZ announced that although buyers would be paying in US </p><p>dollars, the growers would be paid in Zim dollars to avoid </p><p>the type of forex-based speculation which reigned last year </p><p>and provided a windfall for buyers.  This resulted in several </p><p>days of protest at the tobacco auction houses, during which </p><p>many growers refused to consummate sales wherein they </p><p>received inadequate payment in Zim dollars despite reasonable </p><p>prices offered in US dollars.  Makoni subsequently announced </p><p>an 80% "price support" for tobacco growers, which resulted in </p><p>the farmers being paid at the "blend rate" of Zim $99 per </p><p>kilo.  Since the buyers paid for their purchases in US </p><p>dollars, this meant that the GOZ retained anywhere from Zim </p><p>$777.30 per kilo (for tobacco selling at a low of US $1.27 </p><p>per kilo) to Zim $1957.20 per kilo (for tobacco selling at a </p><p>high of US $2.98 per kilo). After the announcement of the new </p><p>"viability price," the farmers are being paid at an exchange </p><p>rate of 158.5:1, with retroactive effect for all sales made </p><p>this season.  Using an average price of US $2.00 per kilo, </p><p>GOZ has now agreed to pay the growers Zim $317.00 per kilo. </p><p>The interesting point here, of course, is that the GOZ still </p><p>retains the difference between the growers\' payout and the </p><p>buyers\' remittance in forex. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) It remains unclear whether this support price will </p><p>provide enough incentive to save Zimbabwe\'s tobacco market, </p><p>which has traditionally depended on the output of large-scale </p><p>commercial growers.  The general estimate is that it costs </p><p>between Zim $200-$300 to produce one kilo of flue-cured </p><p>tobacco.  While the more efficient farmers, a category which </p><p>tends to include the larger scale growers, will undoubtedly </p><p>make a profit, the profit margin is minimal compared to that </p><p>they would have made had the government not retained the </p><p>difference resulting from the imbalanced exchange rate.  At </p><p>this point, based on both the low profitability of this </p><p>year\'s crop and the uncertainty as to whether any large-scale </p><p>growers will be allowed to stay on their land past the August </p><p>10th deadline, most estimates of next year\'s crop point to a </p><p>50% reduction from this year\'s crop -- which itself is about </p><p>a 25% reduction the previous year\'s crop.  There are already </p><p>some intimations that the big buyers are looking farther </p><p>afield for next year\'s buying season.  If the tobacco crop </p><p>fails to bring the buyers next year, as happened after the </p><p>Unilateral Declaration of Independence days, it will take a </p><p>minimum of ten years for the industry to woo them back, when </p><p>and if it recovers a sound footing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Luxury Goods </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The last category of products subject to a </p><p>devaluation is "luxury goods," which is defined as any import </p><p>which does not "feed into production and essential services." </p><p> This group of non-essential goods includes passenger </p><p>vehicles, oil fats, beverages, tobacco and manufactured </p><p>goods.  Since the luxury products are now valued at an </p><p>exchange rate of 300:1 rather than 55:1, the duty on these </p><p>goods can potentially rise in the range of 500%.  Makoni </p><p>stated that he expected to raise up to Zim $11.5 billion </p><p>through this "enhanced customs revenue" in order to support </p><p>the recently approved Zim $52 billion supplemental budget. </p><p> </p><p>Economic Predictions </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) At least one prominent local economist, who has </p><p>excellent Zanu-PF connections, theorizes that the current GOZ </p><p>position on devaluation will be maintained for the next few </p><p>months.  However, he anticipates a minimal devaluation by </p><p>September/October to the 180:1 range.  According to his </p><p>calculations, the population has already suffered the major </p><p>shock related to devaluation since many products have moved </p><p>from the formal marketplace to the parallel market, which is </p><p>providing goods at the 700:1 range.  If the GOZ devalued the </p><p>Zim dollar enough to reach a blend rate of about 300:1, the </p><p>general cost of inputs would drop, and since there would be </p><p>less incentive for sellers to use the parallel market, goods </p><p>would again be found in the formal sector.  Since most goods </p><p>are already the subject of targeted (if unofficial) </p><p>devaluations, only energy and fuel costs would be radically </p><p>affected by a general devaluation.  Even though the energy </p><p>and fuel costs would rise under a general devaluation, their </p><p>inflationary increase would be balanced by the deflationary </p><p>effect on most other goods, and the net effect would not be </p><p>inflationary. </p><p> </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Comment: The GOZ has created a de facto patchwork </p><p>devaluation based on its announcement of a "viability price" </p><p>for tobacco, along with its implementation of the 300:1 </p><p>valuation for luxury goods.  As one local economist observed, </p><p>when any president says "never" to devaluation, that is the </p><p>moment to expect it imminently -- although in the case of </p><p>Zimbabwe, through a stealth devaluation, or devaluation </p><p>"through the back door," allowing the GOZ to preserve </p><p>deniability and save face. In some circles, there is </p><p>certainty that change must come within the next six months </p><p>based on several factors.  The first factor is growing </p><p>hunger, which is demonstrably affecting more people and their </p><p>families; and as one recent letter to the editor stated, "A </p><p>hungry man is an angry man."  The other factor is increasing </p><p>divisions within the Zanu-PF politburo, where consensus is </p><p>emerging on the need to take rational steps to address the </p><p>economic debacle, although nobody -- aside from Makoni -- yet </p><p>seems willing to move from words to action.  End comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
