<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 007726 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ELECTIONS: OUR ANALYSIS AND PREDICTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 7713 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The Islam-influenced AK (Justice and </p><p>Development) of R. Tayyip Erdogan will be the clear winner in </p><p>the Turkish national elections on Nov. 3, and has a strong </p><p>shot at a Parliamentary majority.  Deniz Baykal\'s </p><p>Establishmentarian, left-of-center Republican Peoples\' Party </p><p>(CHP) will probably finish second, though the gap between it </p><p>and the rest of the pack will be relatively small.  How other </p><p>major parties will fare -- and whether they make it over the </p><p>10% national vote threshold and into Parliament -- may well </p><p>now be the critical factor for Turkey\'s immediate politicfal </p><p>future.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>AK is Here </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AK will win big.  The party\'s own poll numbers suggest </p><p>that it will get at least 30 percent of the vote.  In our </p><p>view, such figures represent low-end, conservative estimates </p><p>sustained over a considerable period of time.  We are </p><p>inclined to put AK in the mid-30s at least, with a legitimate </p><p>shot at still more. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The remaining question is not whether AK will win a </p><p>plurality of the vote, but by how much -- and whether its </p><p>margin of victory will grant it a parliamentary majority, </p><p>perhaps one sufficient (367 of 550 seats) to amend Turkey\'s </p><p>Kemalist constitution.  This is well within the realm of the </p><p>possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Continuing last-ditch efforts by the Deep State to clip </p><p>the party\'s wings and shave its vote tally could have an </p><p>impact on the outcome -- with observers divided over whether </p><p>such moves will generate a popular reaction that could </p><p>actually enhance rather than limit AK\'s numbers.  Recent </p><p>ham-handed attempts by the State to undercut AK include: 1) </p><p>Appeals Court and Election Board decisions to rule Erdogan </p><p>ineligible to stand for elections; 2) the recent filing of a </p><p>closure case against AK; 3) statements by President Sezer </p><p>widely interpreted as hinting he might not grant the mandate </p><p>to form a government to a victorious AK; and 4) last-minute </p><p>legal proceedings raising the possibility of post-election </p><p>annulment of AK votes on yet another technicality -- </p><p>Erdogan\'s name is still listed on the ballot as Party </p><p>Chairman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Supporters of the Islamist Saadet Party and former P.M. </p><p>Necmettin Erbakan, its de facto leader, are also sensing an </p><p>AK victory and appear to be gravitating to Erdogan, which </p><p>would keep Saadet on the sidelines after Nov. 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>CHP Second by Default </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CHP will wind up a distant second, probably in the </p><p>mid-teens though with an outside shot at 20 percent of the </p><p>vote on election day.  CHP is trying to portray itself as the </p><p>Kemalist Establishment\'s champion and only viable alternative </p><p>to AK.  However, CHP has done little to capture the popular </p><p>imagination, and indeed has alienated many centrist voters. </p><p>Whereas AK support cuts across a broad swath of the </p><p>socio-political pie, CHP\'s appeal is confined to </p><p>left-of-center urban voters.  Moreover, CHP has made numerous </p><p>strategic and tactical errors that are costing it the chance </p><p>to monopolize the roughly 30 percent of the vote that </p><p>traditionally is apportioned to the left here.  As Kemal </p><p>Dervis -- whose candidacy for CHP is proving more </p><p>controversial than the secularist Establishment had expected </p><p>-- confided to us this week, CHP is not making the progress </p><p>it wanted.  He also lamented once again his decision to </p><p>abandon the New Turkey (YT) Party of Ismail Cem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- CHP local activists show none of the enthusiasm for Baykal </p><p>and the party that is the rule on the AK side.  A CHP </p><p>activist in Zongludak, a Black Sea haven of the labor </p><p>constituency, expressed concern that divisive Baykal would </p><p>"bring the country down" if he becomes Prime Minister.  A </p><p>journalist at the Kemalist Cumhuriyet daily told us he would </p><p>vote for Baykal, even though "I hate him." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- CHP, moreover, has failed to monopolize the Aegean region, </p><p>which was crucial to the victory of Bulent Ecevit\'s </p><p>Democratic Left (DSP) in 1999. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Notably, Izzetin Dogan, one of the leading voices of an </p><p>Alevi community that has traditionally backed the center-left </p><p>and CHP, is signaling publicly that his co-religionists are </p><p>not in any way indebted to CHP, nor should they feel </p><p>compelled to vote for it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Curtains for Current GOT Parties </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Despite Ecevit\'s full-court effort to stoke secularist </p><p>and nationalist fears among an anxious electorate, his DSP </p><p>looks set to finish below the 10% national vote threshold and </p><p>out of Parliament -- though it could pull in sufficient votes </p><p>to hurt CHP.  Similarly D/P.M. Mesut Yilmaz\' ANAP </p><p>(Motherland) is playing its support for EU-related </p><p>democratization for all its worth, and the party gets credit </p><p>on the local level and for some of its regional candidates. </p><p>Nevertheless, ANAP appears to need a miracle to overcome </p><p>general public distrust of Yilmaz and reach the threshold. </p><p>Voters also seem set to punish Deputy P.M. Devlet Bahceli\'s </p><p>Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) by keeping it out of the </p><p>next Parliament.  MHP\'s militant grassroots see Bahceli as </p><p>failing to deliver on his ultranationalist campaign promises. </p><p> However, the MHP base has a reputation for blind loyalty and </p><p>could return to the fold on election day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Genc and the Rest </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Genc (Youth) Parti of Motorola deadbeat Cem Uzan </p><p>could well emerge as the surprise of the 2002 race.  Some </p><p>observers compare the rise of Genc to that of MHP, which came </p><p>in from the political fringe to capture 18% of the vote in </p><p>the 1999 elecitons.  Genc and MHP share some of the same </p><p>xenophobic and populist ideological convictions and compete </p><p>for the same constituency -- MHP insiders admit to us </p><p>privately that Genc is cutting into their support base. </p><p>Nevertheless, there are some significant differences.  Uzan </p><p>has vast media and financial resources denied to MHP.  On the </p><p>other hand, MHP, unlike Genc, has a decades-long track record </p><p>and is a known quantity among voters, attributes that made it </p><p>a viable "protest" vehicle for disaffected voters in 1999. </p><p>While some of our contacts dismiss Genc\'s chances to clear </p><p>the 10% threshold, others insist in might attract up to </p><p>12-14% on election day -- which would threaten CHP\'s hold on </p><p>second place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Another potential surprise is the pro-Kurdish DEHAP </p><p>(Democratic People\'s Party), which is within striking </p><p>distance of the vote threshold.  Like previous pro-Kurdish </p><p>parties, DEHAP is set to dominate in the Kurdish southeast </p><p>(with AK a possible second). Unlike its predecessors, DEHAP </p><p>seems to have picked up support from migrant Kurds in the </p><p>western cities, in central Anatolia, and even in the Black </p><p>Sea region -- votes which in the past have gone to Erbakan </p><p>and his Islamist parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The True Path Party (DYP) of Tansu Ciller is on the bubble </p><p>but, according to various contacts, has gained ground among </p><p>rural Anatolian voters in recent weeks and might well reach </p><p>the threshold (reftel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Comment: Get Ready </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The race for 10% is still not completely decided -- </p><p>and so neither is the breakdown of the post-election </p><p>Parliament, which could host as few as two and as many as six </p><p>parties.  The outcome will also have a major impact on how </p><p>seats are apportioned, and thus, on the potential AK majority </p><p>or on leaders\' calculations as to possible coalition </p><p>alternatives.  The bottom line: whatever the ultimate </p><p>arithmetical outcome, we should expect significant changes in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
