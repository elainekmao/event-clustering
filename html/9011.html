<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001674 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SMIG, CVIS, PREL, PGOV, PINS, PINR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: RECENT GOG ACTIONS TO COMBAT ALIEN SMUGGLING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: The GOG cooperated fully with us in the </p><p>expulsion through the US of alien smuggler Karla Chavez, </p><p>wanted by US law enforcement authorities in connection with </p><p>the May 13 death of 19 illegal aliens in Victoria, Texas. </p><p>Foreign Minister Gutierrez also informed the Ambassador that </p><p>the GOG was replacing a large number of Consuls believed to </p><p>be involved in inappropriate issuance of visas to intending </p><p>immigrants to the US, in response to complaints by the </p><p>Ambassador that new GOG visa regulations would favor alien </p><p>smuggling.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On June 14, Guatemalan immigration authorities </p><p>expelled alleged alien smuggler Karla Chavez Joya to her </p><p>native Honduras, through Houston, where she was arrested by </p><p>US law enforcement authorities in connection with the deaths </p><p>of 19 illegal aliens in Victoria, Texas on May 13.  Chavez is </p><p>believed to be the head of the smuggling ring responsible for </p><p>the incident in Victoria, Texas.  The June 13-14 operation, </p><p>which resulted in Chavez\'s arrest by Guatemalan authorities </p><p>for an immigration violation and her subsequent expulsion to </p><p>Honduras via Houston, was carefully coordinated between the </p><p>DHS office in Embassy Guatemala and GOG Immigration Director </p><p>Oscar Contreras and his deputy Ramon Canek.  Guatemalan </p><p>cooperation was critical to the success of this operation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On June 24, Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez </p><p>informed the Ambassador that the GOG had taken a number of </p><p>measures to address concerns raised earlier by the Ambassador </p><p>that new Guatemalan visa policy (i.e. increased flexibility </p><p>for issuing Guatemalan visas for nationals of certain Latin </p><p>American countries with high illegal immigration rates) could </p><p>result in increased transit through Guatemala of illegal </p><p>aliens heading to the US.  Gutierrez told the Ambassador that </p><p>indeed the GOG believes that inappropriate issuance of </p><p>Guatemalan visas by a number of consuls had contributed to </p><p>this problem, and that as a result of an extensive </p><p>investigation, the MFA had decided to replace all of its </p><p>consular officials in Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, </p><p>Colombia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic.  Gutierrez said </p><p>that the new consuls would be drawn exclusively from the </p><p>MFA\'s professional consular corps, and that they would </p><p>undergo training on immigration fraud before being sent to </p><p>their new posts. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment:  The recent GOG actions to combat alien </p><p>smuggling, responding to our specific requests, will create </p><p>further disincentives for alien smugglers to see Guatemala as </p><p>a country of safe passage. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
