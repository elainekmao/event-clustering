DESPITE THE ON GOING DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>INCLUDING FOOD CONVOYS PROTECTED BY THE UGANDAN ARMY </p><p>ORGANIZED BY WFP, THE OVERALL PICTURE IN THE PROTECTED </p><p>VILLAGES IS ONE OF SEVERE DESTITUTION, WITH POPULATIONS </p><p>REDUCED TO DEPENDENCY, IDLENESS AND DEBILITATING </p><p>UNCERTAINTY. THE POPULATIONS OF THE IDP CAMPS ARE TIGHTLY </p><p>PACKED TOGETHER, OFTEN WITH ONLY AN ARM\'S LENGTH BETWEEN </p><p>HOUSES. (A WALK THROUGH ALERO CAMP REVEALED THAT PERSONAL </p><p>ASSETS ARE INDEED MEAGER.) </p><p> </p><p>8. PRESENTLY, THE ABILITY OF DISTRICT AUTHORITIES AND NON- </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL (NGO) ORGANIZATIONS TO DELIVER SERVICES AND </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THESE VILLAGES/CAMPS IS SEVERELY LIMITED. MANY </p><p>CAMP SCHOOLS ARE EFFECTIVELY CLOSED BECAUSE PARENTS ARE </p><p>AFRAID THAT THE REBELS WILL RAID THE SCHOOLS AND KIDNAP </p><p>THEIR CHILDREN.

ON PAST OCCASIONS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS </p><p>COMMENTED CRITICALLY ON THE LESS THAN ADEQUATE CONDITIONS OF </p><p>THE DISPLACED CAMPS IN THE ACHOLI REGION. IN THE USAID- </p><p>COMMISSIONED GERSONY REPORT ("THE ANGUISH OF NORTHERN </p><p>UGANDA" - AUGUST 1997), THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED: "IN SUM, THE </p><p>GULU-PROTECTED VILLAGES HAVE CAUSED SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC </p><p>LOSSES, [ARE] INADEQUATELY ORGANIZED AND HAVE INCREASED </p><p>DISAFFECTION FROM THE GOVERNMENT AT A TIME WHEN PUBLIC </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE INSURGENTS WAS AT ITS LOWEST EBB.THE </p><p>PROTECTED VILLAGE POLICY MERITS SERIOUS RE-EVALUATION AND </p><p>SHOULD BE PHASED OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>THE LRA - WHAT ARE THEY? </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. THE LRA HAS, AT THE VERY LEAST, MANY OF THE ATTRIBUTES </p><p>OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION: IT LACKS ANY CLEARLY FORMULATED </p><p>POLITICAL OBJECTIVE, IT TENDS TO AVOID DIRECT CONTACT WITH </p><p>OPPOSING ARMED FORCES, AND ITS HOLD ON THE PEOPLE OF THE </p><p>REGION DERIVES DIRECTLY FROM THE TERROR IT INSPIRES. BY </p><p>TARGETING CIVILIANS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY, THE LRA WOULD APPEAR </p><p>TO FIT THE CLASSIC TERRORIST DEFINITION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>ESCALATING NUMBERS OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED IN NORTHERN </p><p>UGANDA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>11.

TOTAL 772,000. NOTE: THE NUMBERS FOR PADER HAVE NOT </p><p>BEEN VERIFIED; WFP RECEIVED A LETTER FROM UGANDA\'S OFFICE OF </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER DATED NOVEMBER 11 REQUESTING URGENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR 19 NEW CAMPS IN PADER DISTRICT TO ASSIST </p><p>204,780 NEWLY DISPLACED.

IF THE SITUATION WORSENS IN PADER, THERE IS </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER MOVEMENT INTO THESE ADJACENT </p><p>DISTRICTS. </p><p> </p><p>12. WFP\'S CURRENT NUMBERS ARE HIGHER THAN THE NOVEMBER </p><p>ESTIMATES OF 735,000 MADE BY DISTRICT AUTHORITIES, THE GOU </p><p>AND HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES, AND CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE </p><p>2003 WFP IDP PLANNING FIGURE OF 494,457 (CONTAINED IN THE </p><p>WFP PROTRACTED RELIEF AND RECOVERY OPERATION APPROVED IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 2002).

THE ONLY DURABLE SOLUTION TO THE REFUGEE PROBLEM </p><p>IN UGANDA IS CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN </p><p>(SOUTHERN SUDAN, RWANDA AND DRC), REPATRIATION AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT. THE INTERMEDIATE SOLUTION FOR REFUGEE SELF- </p><p>RELIANCE IN UGANDA RELATES TO THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF </p><p>LAND ALLOCATED TO REFUGEES, INCOME ACQUISITION STRATEGIES </p><p>AND OTHER COPING MECHANISMS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06146  03 OF 04  271819Z </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. THERE IS A DEEPENING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN NORTHERN </p><p>UGANDA AND INCREASED NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION IS </p><p>NEEDED TO PREVENT STARVATION, ALLEVIATE SUFFERING AND </p><p>PROTECT THE WELFARE OF DISPLACED PERSONS, PARTICULARLY </p><p>CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>15. GOU NEEDS TO FURTHER ENHANCE ITS EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE </p><p>SAFE AND CONTINUOUS DELIVERY OF RELIEF SUPPLIES AND SERVICES </p><p>TO NEEDY POPULATIONS IN THE REGION. (EMBASSY HAS </p><p>CONSISTENTLY RAISED THIS MATTER WITH THE GOU.) ONE SPECIFIC </p><p>SUGGESTION WOULD BE GOU REPAIR/MAINTENANCE OF THE LIRA- </p><p>KITGUM ROAD, WHICH HAS APPARENTLY DETERIORATED OVER THE </p><p>RECENT RAINY SEASON. </p><p> </p><p>16.

WHILE RECOGNIZING SECURITY CONSTRAINTS, A NUTRITION </p><p>SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE BY THE UN </p><p>(WORKING WITH NGOS AS APPROPRIATE) TO TRACK TRENDS IN </p><p>NUTRITIONAL STATUS, FOOD SECURITY AND RELATED ISSUES. </p><p>SPECIFIC ATTENTION MAY BE PAID TO MONITORING THE NUTRITIONAL </p><p>STATUS OF CHILDREN UNDER FIVE AND CRUDE MORTALITY RATE </p><p>(CMR). WFP AND ITS PRINCIPAL IMPLEMENTING PARTNER NORWEGIAN </p><p>REFUGEE COUNCIL ARE REQUESTED TO RECOMMENCE POST- </p><p>DISTRIBUTION MONITORING WHEREVER POSSIBLE. OTHER NGOS WHERE </p><p>APPROPRIATE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO ACCOMPANY WFP PROTECTED </p><p>CONVOYS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06146  03 OF 04  271819Z </p><p> </p><p>18. WITH ESCALATING BENEFICIARY NUMBERS IN THE NORTHERN </p><p>DISTRICTS, GOU IS ENCOURAGED TO STEP UP ITS OWN FOOD </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO WFP. (EMBASSY HAS ALREADY RAISED THIS WITH </p><p>THE GOU.) </p><p> </p><p>19. GIVEN THAT THE EXTANT WFP/PRRO WAS APPROVED IN FEBRUARY </p><p>2002, WFP NEEDS TO IMMEDIATELY RE-WRITE PARTS OF THE PRRO TO </p><p>REFLECT THE NEW REALITIES ON THE GROUND.

THE UN IS ENCOURAGED, IN THE APPOINTMENT OF THE NEXT </p><p>UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE, TO SELECT SOMEONE WITH SOLID </p><p>HUMANITARIAN EXPERIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>23. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE ABDUCTION OF CHILDREN BY THE LRA, AND </p><p>URGE THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF ALL CHILD SOLDIERS AND </p><p>CHILDREN AFFILIATED WITH COMBATANTS IN THE REGION.

THESE INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS) ARE </p><p>LARGELY DEPENDENT ON HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES (PARTICULARLY WFP </p><p>AND A HANDFUL OF NGOS) FOR A MAJOR PORTION OF THEIR FOOD AND </p><p>BASIC SERVICES.
