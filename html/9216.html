<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001911 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>APP WINNIPEG 03/001 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, PGOV, PREL, CA, Manitoba </p><p>SUBJECT: MANITOBA DAY IN LOS ANGELES </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Canadian Consul General in Los Angeles, Colin </p><p>Robertson, hosted a broad Manitoba trade mission led by </p><p>Premier Gary Doer as a part of the Consulate\'s Canada Day </p><p>celebrations.  The trade mission included announcements of </p><p>several important business deals and entertainment ventures. </p><p>The most surprising announcement was a contract for the sale </p><p>of over 1 million pounds of Manitoban carrots (from leading </p><p>produce trader Peak of the Market) to Western Veg-Produce of </p><p>Bakersfield.  Peak of the Market CEO Larry McIntosh told </p><p>Consul that he couldn\'t believe he was selling carrots to </p><p>California, a traditional carrot exporter.  Maple Leaf </p><p>Distillers also announced plans to expand its distribution </p><p>system to provide spirits and liqueurs (worth some $20 </p><p>million annually) to some 2000 outlets in California. </p><p> </p><p>2. On the entertainment front, Manitoba bands were </p><p>highlighted at a top L.A. club in a "Manitoba Sound Night" </p><p>featuring Holly McNarland, Doc Walker, McMaster and James, </p><p>and Waking Eyes.  And one of Winnipeg\'s most famous </p><p>citizens, "Let\'s Make A Deal" host Monty Hall, was honored </p><p>for his charity work by Manitoba Lt. Governor Peter Liba </p><p>with the Order of Manitoba. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Among the business deals announced were the opening of a </p><p>Los Angeles office by Frantic Films, a film and TV </p><p>production and post-production firm, and a cooperative </p><p>production agreement between the Manitoba Theatre Center and </p><p>the Rubicon Theater in Ventura, which includes an exchange </p><p>of productions between the theaters as well as the co- </p><p>production of a Eugene O\'Neill play.  Winnipeg-based John </p><p>Aaron Productions announced plans with two other U.S. film </p><p>producers for cross-border productions of several films, </p><p>including "American Woman," about Winnipeg\'s own rock band, </p><p>"the Guess Who." </p><p> </p><p>4. COMMENT:  Provincial and city officials realize that  the </p><p>U.S. presents the greatest opportunities for economic </p><p>growth, but also that the lack of awareness in the U.S. </p><p>about Winnipeg and Manitoba is among their greatest </p><p>obstacles.  Events such as "Manitoba Day" are less about </p><p>sales but rather represent a concerted effort to raise the </p><p>profile of the region as a business and investment </p><p>destination.  End comment. </p><p></p></div>
