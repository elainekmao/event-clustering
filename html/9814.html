<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 004851 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, EUR, EUR/SE, NEA AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, PTER, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH TROOPS FOR IRAQ: GOT NEEDS TO SHOW </p><p>PUBLIC/PARLIAMENT BROAD COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires, a.i. Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) In separate meetings July 30 with MFA Deputy U/S Baki </p><p>Ilkin and PM Advisor Ahmet Davutoglu, Charge was told that </p><p>the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister want a Turkish troop </p><p>deployment to Iraq, but must take to Parliament any decision </p><p>to deploy troops to Iraq.  In an effort to get to yes while </p><p>limiting political risk of another long public debate, the </p><p>GOT hopes to bring the issue to Parliament when the time is </p><p>suitable for a speedy discussion of the motion, which will </p><p>require creating an environment in which the Turkish public </p><p>and Parliament see that the troop deployment as one piece of </p><p>a much broader US-Turkey partnership to stabilize Iraq, </p><p>including significant political, reconstruction and </p><p>anti-PKK/KADEK activity.  Both Ilkin and Davutoglu called FM </p><p>Gul\'s Washington trip successful and noted Gul had briefed </p><p>the cabinet on his return concerning a possible Turkish troop </p><p>deployment.  Davutoglu noted that unlike the divisive cabinet </p><p>discussions before the war, this briefing was well-received </p><p>and did not elicit any negative discussion.  Ilkin said that </p><p>the TGS would want a green light from the GOT, which they did </p><p>not have,  before considering even preliminary </p><p>military-to-military talks.  He noted that trying to rush a </p><p>Turkish decision on the troop deployment would be </p><p>counter-productive.  Ilkin also complained about a Turkish </p><p>press story that, following the passage of the reintegration </p><p>law, the US planned to send top PKK/KADEK operatives to </p><p>Scandinavian countries.  He said failure to refute such </p><p>misinformation and demonstrate real cooperation against the </p><p>PKK/KADEK could color the troop deployment debate.  He added </p><p>that the GOT was keen for elements of cooperation to begin </p><p>asap.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>GOT To Take To TGNA When Broad Partnership More Evident </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) In separate July 30 meetings with the Charge, MFA </p><p>Deputy Undersecretary Ilkin and PM Advisor Prof. Ahmet </p><p>Davutoglu used similar points concerning the need for the GOT </p><p>to bring the matter of a possible Turkish troop deployment to </p><p>Iraq before the Parliament.  They said it would be critical, </p><p>in gaining Parliamentary approval and public support, for the </p><p>deployment to be viewed by Turks as only one part of a much </p><p>broader partnership with the US in the restoration of Iraqi </p><p>stability, the development of the Iraqi political system, and </p><p>in Davutoglu\'s words, the normalization of everyday life for </p><p>the people of Iraq.  It was with this in mind that the Turks </p><p>had submitted to the US their list of non-military </p><p>assisstance proposals, the response to which, they said, was </p><p>generally positively received by the Turkish side.  Davutoglu </p><p>went further and said the response would be helpful in </p><p>demonstrating that the Turkish contribution would not be only </p><p>or predominantly military.  Ilkin said that as the public saw </p><p>that Turkey was working with the US to build a new Iraq </p><p>economically and politically, domestic support for a Turkish </p><p>troop deployment would increase.  If the military deployment </p><p>was seen as Turkey\'s sole or primary contribution, it would </p><p>be hard to get through Parliament.  Overall, he said, "we are </p><p>on course.  The FM is aware of the urgency.  The AK Party and </p><p>the cabinet both need to discuss the matter in detail...What </p><p>we need now is a political decision."  Davutoglu said that </p><p>the FM Gul had briefed the cabinet on a possible Turkish </p><p>deployment when he returned from Washington, that unlike </p><p>before the war, the cabinet was not divided or negative in </p><p>response, but that at this point, the matter was only at the </p><p>stage of being discussed in principle by the cabinet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Positive Steps By US on PKK/KADEK Will Help Move Troop Issue </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Davutoglu said that the GOT did not want to risk a </p><p>repeat of what happened on March 1, and therefore had crafted </p><p>a different approach.  Rather than concentrate on northern </p><p>Iraq, Turkey now views the country as a whole and underscores </p><p>that the US and Turkey share deep common interests in the </p><p>territorial integrity and stability of Iraq.  In northern </p><p>Iraq, he said, the key was the future of the PKK/KADEK.  The </p><p>GOT would not be able to explain to the Turkish public why </p><p>its troops were in Baghdad and the west if the PKK/KADEK </p><p>problem remained in the north.  Positive steps by the US on </p><p>PKK/KADEK issues in the coming days and weeks would help, he </p><p>said.  Davutoglu also repeated the Turkish request that </p><p>Iraq\'s Governing Council invite Turkey to send troops, as </p><p>this would create the impression that the Iraqi people were, </p><p>in part, the demandeur and would allow the GOT to argue that </p><p>Iraqis want the Turkish military contribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>TGS Will Wait For GOT OK To Hold Mil-Mil Talks </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) When Charge asked Ilkin if the GOT had considered </p><p>entering military-to-military talks on an exploratory basis, </p><p>noting that CENTCOM was ready for such discussions, Ilkin </p><p>replied that the TGS needs a green light from the GOT, which </p><p>it did not now have, before starting such talks.  Ilkin </p><p>added, "I would wait until I got a signal from the GOT...my </p><p>advice is please, do not rush this.  The last time you rushed </p><p>us and it was counterproductive.  We couldn\'t deliver.  There </p><p>should be a GOT consensus one way or the other first." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Rumor of Asylum in Norway Has Turks Concerned </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Ilkin raised a story that ran in the July 30 edition </p><p>of Hurriyet newspaper, that would be taken up again in a CNN </p><p>Turk TV interview the night of July 31, claiming that there </p><p>was a secret plan for 100 of the top leaders would be sent to </p><p>Scandinavia as political asylum seekers.  Ilkin asked that </p><p>the Embassy refute this story, as the GOT would be questioned </p><p>about it.  As long as some were able to create a public </p><p>portrayal of the US as soft on the PKK/KADEK, there would be </p><p>a negative impact on the possible troop deployment.  He said </p><p>it would be easier for the GOT to get public support if the </p><p>process toward troop deployment started with successful </p><p>cooperation on PKK/KADEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Charge noted that the State Department had made a </p><p>public statement welcoming the passage of the reintegration </p><p>law, that U/S Grossman had been interviewed on the subject by </p><p>CNN Turk and had said that the US would cooperate with Turkey </p><p>to eliminate the PKK/KADEK.  We would need to work together </p><p>with Turkey on information operations in northern Iraq to </p><p>inform people of the new law and to have a full information </p><p>exchange on PKK/KADEK to move operations to the next step. </p><p>Ilkin said that the GOT was told that as soon as the law was </p><p>enacted there would be discussions between the MFA and the </p><p>State Dept.  He was eager for those discussions to be </p><p>arranged.  Davutoglu also stressed that the PKK/KADEK </p><p>operatives were to Turkey like al Qaeda was to the US, and </p><p>that the GOT wanted them turned over to Turkey.  He called </p><p>the State Department statement on the new reintegration law </p><p>"very positive."  Charge stressed that the GOT had a </p><p>commitment from the USG that we would cooperate with Turkey </p><p>to eliminate the PKK/KADEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Political Environment Today </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Pro-deployment voices are greatly outnumbered in </p><p>Turkey, particularly in the aftermath of March 1 and the </p><p>increase in anti-US sentiment in Turkey since the war.  The </p><p>already inhospitable atmosphere took a turn for the worse </p><p>after the July 4 Sulaymaniyah incident and a massive anti-US </p><p>media campaign.  Turkish press commentary now portrays a </p><p>damaged US-Turkey relationship heading toward another crisis </p><p>over the possible Turkish deployment with both sides making </p><p>the same mistakes: alleged USG insensitivity to the political </p><p>difficulties involved; and on the Turkish side, an </p><p>exaggerated view of Turkey\'s strategic importance, leading to </p><p>inflated expectations of USG "concessions" for Turkey\'s </p><p>support.  Two of the negative influences from March 1, </p><p>President Sezer, who stressed "international legitimacy," and </p><p>Parliamentary speaker Arinc, who emphasized the public\'s </p><p>negative sentiment, have already raised their voices.  In </p><p>short, the picture is of a Turkey about to overplay its hand </p><p>again.  MFA spokesman Dirioz told us privately that the huge </p><p>pro-establishment Dogan media empire has decided to support a </p><p>possible Turkish deployment.  Dogan\'s track record, however, </p><p>suggests it will continue to play both sides of the divide. </p><p>While the last few days demonstrate the GOT is trying to mold </p><p>the public discussion in a more positive direction, the </p><p>pressure of domestic issues and sentiment will make it </p><p>difficult. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Althought the PM, FM, MFA officials and the TGS Chief </p><p>have privately expressed their intention to find a way for </p><p>Turkey to participate in the stabilization force in Iraq, we </p><p>are not yet seeing leadership from the elected politicians, </p><p>bureaucrats or military leaders necessary to shape public </p><p>opinion and outflank the vocal opponents.  We expect that the </p><p>GOT will use the upcoming two-month legislative recess to </p><p>assess the Iraq stabilization process including the PKK/KADEK </p><p>issue, the developments in Iraq\'s political and economic </p><p>reconstruction, as well as Turkey\'s ability to participate. </p><p>(Note: The Parliament could return in extraordinary session </p><p>if circumstances warrant.  End note.)  The AK government will </p><p>also want to see whether TGS Chief Ozkok, with whom Erdogan </p><p>has a modus vivendi, can promote into key leadership posts in </p><p>August more like-minded generals.  In short, while the ball </p><p>is in Turkey\'s court, we can help get them to yes on a troop </p><p>contribution by creating a broader sense of commitment to the </p><p>partnership they seek in non-military sectors and on the </p><p>PKK/KADEK issue as a matter of priority. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
