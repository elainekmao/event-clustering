<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003936 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KPAL, CASC, KWBG, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN TIGHTENS BORDER BUT PROMISES SOME </p><p>LOOSENING...AFTER MESSAGE TO ISRAEL IS MADE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 01 AMMAN 3763 B. JERUSALEM 2027 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Despite public reassurances that travel restrictions </p><p>on Palestinians entering Jordan have been eased, tacit </p><p>acknowledgments made privately by Jordanian officials </p><p>buttressed by anecdotal evidence indicate that a quota system </p><p>is in place to restrict the number of Palestinians who can </p><p>cross into Jordan.  This has affected Palestinian Americans </p><p>in many cases (Ref B), though senior Jordanian officials have </p><p>undertaken to ease the restrictions on transiting Palestinian </p><p>Americans.  In the end, however, Jordanian officials are </p><p>unlikely to allow Palestinians--even those with valid </p><p>Jordanian travel documents--unrestricted travel to Jordan </p><p>until the humanitarian situation eases across the river and </p><p>fears of a mass refugee flow diminishes. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>GOJ BORDER RESTRICTIONS EASED...BUT THERE ARE STILL </p><p>RESTRICTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) When the Israelis began "Operation Defensive Shield" </p><p>in March, the GOJ virtually shut down the border as a </p><p>precaution against any mass movements.  Until recently, the </p><p>GOJ allowed Palestinians entry to Jordan only in three </p><p>categories: for medical emergencies, for study, and for </p><p>transit to a third country.  Jordanian officials eased those </p><p>restrictions at the end of June in coordination with the </p><p>Palestinian Interior Ministry.  On July 16, the Palestinian </p><p>Authority published in the Jordanian daily newspaper </p><p>al-Dustor a list of categories of Palestinians who can cross </p><p>into Jordan, reportedly based on agreements worked out </p><p>between the PA and the GOJ.  According to the article, </p><p>Palestinians who are yellow card holders--thus having </p><p>Jordanian citizenship and usually traveling on a Jordanian </p><p>passport--are allowed to cross at any time.  However, green </p><p>card holders--who have usually either forfeited Jordanian </p><p>citizenship when they returned to the West Bank or are West </p><p>Bank residents with East Bank jobs--are allowed entry only if </p><p>they have Jordanian relatives who can request prior approval </p><p>for their travel from GOJ officials (or, based on our </p><p>experience, can prove they have jobs to return to in Jordan). </p><p> For a more detailed description of yellow card holders vs. </p><p>green card holders, please see Ref A.  The article also </p><p>details the exceptions who are given permission to cross: </p><p>students registered or intending to register at Jordanian </p><p>Universities, medical and humanitarian cases, PA staff, </p><p>businessmen, Palestinians who have proof of travel to a third </p><p>country, and those who can prove passage to weddings or </p><p>funerals.  PA officials also urged West Bank residents not to </p><p>travel to the border unless they fall into one of these </p><p>categories. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>PALESTINIANS WELCOME, IN CONTROLLED NUMBERS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) From the official Jordanian optic, the increased </p><p>number of Palestinians at the border reflects a normal </p><p>seasonal spike.  Foreign Minister Muasher recently explained </p><p>to the Ambassador that the numbers at the border have </p><p>increased in the recent weeks, but they are in line with </p><p>previous summers as West Bank Palestinians seek entry to </p><p>visit relatives in Jordan, attend weddings, etc.  While </p><p>Minister of the Interior Qaftan Majali has said publicly that </p><p>"movement across the bridge is normal" and GOJ officials have </p><p>publicly said roughly 1,000 Palestinians are crossing a day, </p><p>Palestinian Jordanian contacts and press reports claim that </p><p>the GOJ is only allowing 350 Palestinian I.D. holders to </p><p>cross a day.  We understand that there is daily communication </p><p>between the Israeli and Jordanian sides before the border </p><p>opens to assure no Palestinians clear the Israeli side </p><p>without permission to enter the Jordanian side. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) GID Director Said Kheir confirmed to the Ambassador </p><p>that the number of Palestinians crossing into Jordan is in </p><p>fact being "controlled" because of "security-driven </p><p>concerns".  The foremost of these concerns is that declining </p><p>humanitarian conditions in the West Bank will trigger another </p><p>Palestinian exodus.  In restricting the number of </p><p>Palestinians allowed to cross, the GOJ is reinforcing the </p><p>message to the Israelis that Jordan will not be used as a </p><p>safety valve.  This policy is a direct consequence of the </p><p>divide separating Palestinian Jordanians and East Bankers. </p><p>Already a minority, East Bankers fear that a new influx of </p><p>Palestinian refugees would fundamentally change the nature of </p><p>the state. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) We defer to Congen Jerusalem as to conditions in the </p><p>West Bank, but we hear anecdotes from travelers which paint a </p><p>fairly grim picture.  Due to curfews and decreased mobility, </p><p>Palestinians in the West Bank are reportedly having </p><p>difficulties procuring airline tickets to prove that they are </p><p>entering Jordan to transit.  Palestinians unable to cross at </p><p>Allenby are trapped in Jericho because road blocks and </p><p>closures inhibit their ability to return home, according to </p><p>Embassy contacts.  Compounding the misery of being trapped in </p><p>Jericho, Palestinian Jordanian contacts have complained that </p><p>corruption has proliferated as the back-up across the river </p><p>has increased.  Companies that facilitate the bridge crossing </p><p>have reportedly doubled their fees. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN AMERICAN DILEMMA...RELIEF IN SIGHT? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Per Ref B, the situation has affected many Palestinian </p><p>Americans who have been unable to transit through Jordan to </p><p>return to the U.S.  While third country nationals are able to </p><p>travel easily into Jordan as "tourists", Palestinian American </p><p>dual citizens who have Palestinian I.D. cards are being </p><p>treated as Palestinians, and as such come under the quota </p><p>system.  The Ambassador has pressed GOJ officials, most </p><p>recently GID director Said Kheir, to allow Palestinian </p><p>Americans to be processed as third country nationals instead </p><p>of as Palestinians.  Kheir agreed to liberalize the process </p><p>to facilitate the movement of Palestinian Americans into </p><p>Jordan and we understand that the situation has eased in some </p><p>individual cases.  We are working on a more systematic </p><p>solution.  Conoff visited the Jordanian side of the Allenby </p><p>bridge on July 16 to view the situation (see septel). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ultimately, this problem will recur as long as </p><p>Jordanian officials worry about the political consequences of </p><p>unrestricted access to Jordan for Palestinians.  An </p><p>improvement in the humanitarian situation in the West Bank </p><p>would do something to ease Jordanian concerns, though only </p><p>genuine progress in the MEPP is likely to make a decisive </p><p>difference for Jordanian policy.  In the meantime, we will </p><p>continue to work to mitigate the effects of long-established </p><p>policy. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
