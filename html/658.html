CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  MAJLIS ASH-SHURA PRESIDENT MOHAMMED BIN </p><p>JUBAIR REVIEWED IN GENERAL TERMS THE WORK OF THE MAJLIS </p><p>ASH-SHURA, ASSERTING THAT IT WAS PROCEEDING SMOOTHLY AND </p><p>SATISFACTORILY.  HE SAID, WITHOUT ELABORATION, THAT THE </p><p>MAJLIS ASH-SHURA HAS NOT YET ESTABLISHED A VISITORS </p><p>POLICY.  ON FOREIGN POLICY, BIN JUBAIR SAID THAT THE </p><p>ATTAINMENT OF PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAS PARAMOUNT, </p><p>THAT HE SUPPORTED U.S. PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA (BUT </p><p>WONDERED WHY THE U.S. DOES NOT APPLY EQUAL PRESSURE ON </p><p>ISRAEL BECAUSE OF ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS), AND THAT HE </p><p>APPROVED OF RECENT U.N. ACTIONS IN BOSNIA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CHARGE APRIL 13 MET WITH MAJLIS ASH-SHURA </p><p>(CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL) PRESIDENT MOHAMMAD BIN JUBAIR TO </p><p>OFFER HIS PERSONAL CONGRATULATIONS ON THE INAUGURATION </p><p>OF THE MAJLIS ASH-SHURA BY KING FAHD LAST DECEMBER 29 </p><p>(REF A) AND TO REVIEW WITH BIN JUBAIR THE ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>THE BODY SINCE THEN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REVIEWS WORK OF COUNCIL:  NO PROBLEMS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  BIN JUBAIR SAID THE WORK OF THE COUNCIL WAS GOING </p><p>SMOOTHLY.  COMMITTEES, COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN AND COMMITTEE </p><p>VICE-CHAIRMEN HAD BEEN NAMED AND EVERYONE WAS VERY BUSY </p><p>AT WORK.  THE COUNCIL MEETS TWICE A MONTH (ON SUNDAYS) </p><p>AND ITS COMMITTEES MEET ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT THE COUNCIL IS CURRENTLY FOCUSING ITS ATTENTION ON </p><p>"REGULATIONS" AND "INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  REVIEWING PROCEDURE -- AND CONFIRMING INFORMATION </p><p>GIVEN TO US IN DECEMBER BY MAJLIS ASH-SHURA VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT ABDULLAH NASEEF (REF B) -- BIN JUBAIR SAID </p><p>THAT AFTER A COMMITTEE HAS STUDIED AN ISSUE, IT SENDS A </p><p>REPORT TO THE FULL COUNCIL.  IF THERE ARE OBJECTIONS IN </p><p>THE COUNCIL, THE REPORT IS REVIEWED BY THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL (COMPRISED OF THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>VICE-PRESIDENT AND COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN) WHICH DECIDES </p><p>WHETHER THE REPORT IS TO BE SENT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR </p><p>FURTHER WORK OR FORWARDED TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS </p><p>FOR ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE MAJLIS ASH-SHURA AND THE </p><p>REGIONAL COUNCILS, BIN JUBAIR SAID THAT THERE WAS AS YET </p><p>NO WORKING RELATIONSHIP.  BUT HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT </p><p>THE REGIONAL BODIES AND THE MAJLIS MIGHT IN FUTURE SHARE </p><p>"STUDIES AND OPINIONS ON CERTAIN TOPICS," PERHAPS </p><p>THROUGH AN ANNUAL JOINT MEETING WHICH MIGHT "OPEN A NEW </p><p>ERA FOR CONSULTATION, DISCUSSIONS AND NEW IDEAS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  RESPONDING TO CHARGE\'S QUESTION AS TO HOW OTHER SAG </p><p>GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WERE REACTING TO THE MAJLIS </p><p>ASH-SHURA, BIN JUBAIR SAID THAT THE MINISTRIES WERE </p><p>GENERALLY PLEASED WITH THE FACT THAT THEY COULD REFER </p><p>THEIR PROBLEMS/ISSUES TO THE MAJLIS WHERE SPECIALISTS </p><p>COULD STUDY AND THEN RECOMMEND SOLUTIONS FOR THEM.  HE </p><p>NOTED HERE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WERE THREE "POWERS" IN </p><p>THE KINGDOM -- THE JUDICIAL, THE EXECUTIVE, AND THE </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL -- THE JUDICIAL (THE ISLAMIC LAW OF THE </p><p>SHARIA)) WAS SUPREME, I.E. THAT THERE WAS NO SET OF </p><p>CHECKS AND BALANCES AT WORK, BUT RATHER LAW DERIVED FROM </p><p>THE QURAN WITH WHICH THE BEHAVIOR OF RULERS AND COUNCILS </p><p>ALIKE MUST BE CONSISTENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UNTIL PROCEDURES ARE ANNOUNCED:  NO VISITORS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  CHARGE ASKED WHETHER THE MAJLIS HAD DEVELOPED A </p><p>VISITORS POLICY.  HE NOTED THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>INTEREST IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE MAJLIS ASH-SHURA IN </p><p>THE U.S. -- THAT NEWS OF THE INAUGURATION OF THE MAJLIS </p><p>IN DECEMBER HAD MADE THE EVEN LOCAL CALIFORNIA PAPERS </p><p>WHERE CHARGE HAD BEEN ON LEAVE -- AND THAT FUTURE </p><p>OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL VISITORS TO THE KINGDOM WOULD </p><p>CERTAINLY BE SEEKING TO MEET WITH MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  JUBAIR SAID THAT THERE WAS AS YET NO PROCEDURE </p><p>WHEREBY FOREIGN ACADEMICS, DIPLOMATS OR HIGH-RANKING </p><p>VISITORS COULD ARRANGE FOR VISITS WITH MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>MAJLIS ASH-SHURA, BUT THAT HE EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD </p><p>BE A WRITTEN POLICY IN THE FUTURE.  HE SAID THAT THOSE </p><p>WISHING TO MEET WITH MAJLIS OFFICIALS NEEDED FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING TO SUBMIT FORMAL DIPLOMATIC REQUESTS TO THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY WHICH WOULD THEN CONSULT WITH THE </p><p>COUNCIL PRESIDENT (I.E. BIN JUBAIR). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS: NUMBER ONE PRIORITY </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  INVITED TO COMMENT ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES, BIN </p><p>JUBAIR SAID THAT PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAS THE NUMBER </p><p>ONE PRIORITY AND THAT SAUDI ARABIA "HOPED, WANTED AND </p><p>EXPECTED" THAT U.S. PARTICIPATION IN THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>WOULD BE "FAIR."  HE FURTHER NOTED THAT HE AGREED WITH </p><p>U.S. PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA TO LIMIT NUCLEAR WEAPONS </p><p>PROLIFERATION, BUT WONDERED WHY THE U.S. WAS NOT </p><p>PRESSURING ISRAEL AS WELL.  HE ALSO EXPRESSED HIS </p><p>APPROVAL OF RECENT U.N. ACTIONS IN BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>11.  CHARGE SAID THAT THE U.S. IS WORKING HARD TO HELP </p><p>ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE REGION AND THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT </p><p>ONE COULD FIND A COUNTRY AS FAIR IN ITS EFFORTS.  CHARGE </p><p>ALSO EXPLAINED THAT ISRAEL IS ONE OF THREE </p><p>NON-SIGNATORIES OF THE NPT.  THE U.S. IS PRESSURING </p><p>NORTH KOREA BECAUSE IT SIGNED THE NPT AND THEN LIED </p><p>ABOUT THE NATURE OF ITS NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES.  CHARGE </p><p>NOTED THAT UNIVERSALITY OF NPT ADHERENCE IS U.S. POLICY, </p><p>A POSITION THAT IS WELL KNOWN TO ISRAEL.  FROM TIME TO </p><p>TIME, WE REITERATE OUR VIEWS ON THIS TO ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE WAITING FOR RESULTS:  NO DISTRACTIONS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  COMMENT:  BIN JUBAIR AND OTHER SAG OFFICIALS HAVE </p><p>TAKEN PAINS TO EXPLAIN TO US THAT THEY VIEW THE MAJLIS </p><p>ASH-SHURA AS A CONSULTATIVE, BUT NOT A DEMOCRATIC OR A </p><p>LEISLATIVE BODY.  IT MAY BE THAT THE SAG HOPES THAT TE </p><p>DELIBERATIONS OF THIS BODY, GUIDED BY THE SAUD </p><p>LEADERSHIP, WILL INCREASE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE REGIME </p><p>AS IT ENTERS A PERIOD OF TOUGH FINANCIAL TIMES REQUIRING </p><p>TOUGH REFORMS.  THE SAG MAY HAVE DECIDED THAT AS THE </p><p>MAJLIS ASH-SHURA FINDS ITS OWN WAY AND UNTIL IT HAS </p><p>ESTABLISHED SOME RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENT, THAT IT DOES </p><p>NOT WANT ITS MEMBERS DISTRACTED BY THE QUERIES OF </p><p>FOREIGN ACADEMICS, DIPLOMATS OR OFFICIALS PUSHING HIDDEN </p><p>(DEMOCRATIC) AGENDAS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR </p><p>OFFICIAL ACCESS TO THE MEMBERS OF THE MAJLIS (WE DO MEET </p><p>MAJLIS MEMBERS UNOFFICIALLY FROM TIME TO TIME ALTHOUGH </p><p>THEY APPEAR TO BE UNDER SOME SORT OF GAG RULE). </p><p> </p><p>14.  IN CHARGE\'S THIRD MEETING WITH HIM (OTHER MEETINGS </p><p>OCCURRED IN JANUARY AND JULY OF LAST YEAR), BIN JUBAIR </p><p>SEEMED RELAXED, CONFIDENT AND READY TO DISCUSS MAJLIS </p><p>AFFAIRS, IF ON HIS OWN TERMS.  HE STRUCK US AS SOMEONE </p><p>WHO BELIEVES IN THE CERTAIN RELIABILITY OF HIS ISLAMIC </p><p>MORAL COMPASS AND WHO IS CONFIDENT THAT FOLLOWING IT </p><p>WILL LEAD TO THE REQUIRED SOLUTIONS.  WITH THAT </p><p>CONFIDENCE BIN JUBAIR SEEMS BENT ON MOVING AT HIS OWN </p><p>DELIBERATE PACE ON WHAT HE SEES TO BE THE NECESSARY WORK </p><p>OF THE MAJLIS ASH-SHURA IN THE FACE OF WHATEVER </p><p>SKEPTICISM MAY EXIST INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WELCH </p><p></p></div>
