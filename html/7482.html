<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002321 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ AND U.S.-SYRIA </p><p>STANDOFF </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, April 16, focus </p><p>on developments on Iraq\'s domestic front.  Front-page </p><p>headlines highlight Iraqi demonstrations against the </p><p>U.S. in some Baghdad neighborhoods and the death of 10 </p><p>Iraqis by Marines\' fire.  Reports also highlight the </p><p>Iraqi opposition meeting.  Other lead stories focus on </p><p>the escalating tension between the United States and </p><p>Syria. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Stop asking for new glories" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(04/15):  "During this war, the Arab people stood </p><p>against the invasion, except for the one people who </p><p>actually fell under that invasion, for they wanted to </p><p>get rid of what they were suffering from..  After this </p><p>recent shock, would it be right to ignore those </p><p>methods of domestic rule that are justified on the </p><p>pretext that they confront foreign intervention? </p><p>Would inflaming emotions with fiery, high-noted pan- </p><p>Arab and Islamic speeches and feeding hopes of </p><p>regaining the glory of the nation justify ignoring the </p><p>oppression and corruption and stepping on of </p><p>individual citizens..  We do not want any single </p><p>leader to decide to drag us into confrontations.  Only </p><p>governments elected by elected parliaments would </p><p>decide such a thing, so that people can bear the </p><p>responsibility, whether negative or positive.. </p><p>Commenting on the objectives of imperialism and </p><p>Zionism in our region and for our people is masked </p><p>idleness that seeks to exempt us from holding </p><p>ourselves accountable for what we are in.  Is it </p><p>logical that a regime would wage two destructive </p><p>useless wars?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "Syria in the bull\'s eye" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/16):  "All of a sudden, the Syrian file is opened: </p><p>Damascus harbors figures from the collapsed regime in </p><p>Baghdad; Damascus harbors terrorist organizations and </p><p>supports others; Damascus produces weapons of mass </p><p>destruction and conceals Iraqi chemical weapons.  What </p><p>is being said in Washington today has definitely been </p><p>said in Tel Aviv before..  War on Syria seems </p><p>farfetched for a number of reasons.  First, Syria is </p><p>not Iraq, and this is not in terms of military power, </p><p>but rather in terms of political and diplomatic </p><p>aspects.  Syria has close relations with many Arab, </p><p>Muslim and European countries and its relations with </p><p>the United States, despite their tense and tepid </p><p>nature, are based on cooperation and coordination. </p><p>Second, Syria is not Iraq, because the nuance in </p><p>Syrian diplomacy can be amazing.  Third, Washington, </p><p>despite the ongoing escalation against Syria, still </p><p>finds room and potential for dialogue and cooperation </p><p>with the Syrian leadership.  For all these reasons, we </p><p>believe that the American campaign against Syria will </p><p>not go beyond political and diplomatic pressures." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Arab world is required to support Syria now" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/16):  "U.S. intentions towards Syria are clear. </p><p>It took but one day after ensuring the collapse of the </p><p>Iraqi regime in Baghdad for America\'s aggressive </p><p>statements against Syria to start, using the same </p><p>false accusation:  weapons of mass destruction.  These </p><p>American statements raised tension and suspicion in </p><p>the Arab world, but at the same time, they removed any </p><p>doubt or misunderstanding regarding U.S. intentions, </p><p>which are aggressive and seek to guarantee full </p><p>protection for Israel." </p><p>-- "The freedom to loot and steal" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(04/16):  "One of the strangest explanations for the </p><p>looting and stealing that occurred in Iraqi cities was </p><p>the U.S. Secretary of Defense\'s statement that what </p><p>happened was the outcome of the end of the era of </p><p>oppression and the beginning taste of freedom brought </p><p>by the Americans, and that these actions are </p><p>considered natural and interim aspects of moving from </p><p>the dictatorship era to the liberation era..  The </p><p>American occupation forces encouraged the looting and </p><p>stealing, not only to cover up their own looting and </p><p>stealing, but also to strike against the Iraqi people, </p><p>to break them and to destroy their self-worth and </p><p>their national pride.  If America meant to strike the </p><p>regime, then the regime is now gone.  America wants to </p><p>confiscate the possibility of establishing an Iraqi </p><p>state, so that the American occupation becomes a </p><p>requirement and the American leadership a refuge." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
