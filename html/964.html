<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 007870 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/19/08 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, MNUC, ENRG, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: SHAHBAZ SHARIF ON NUCLEAR ISSUES, ISLAMIZATION AND POWER </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAHORE 500 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY LAHORE PRINCIPAL OFFICER GEOFFREY PYATT, REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS LAHORE 572 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  MEETING OCTOBER 14 WITH VISITING AMBASSADOR </p><p>MILAM, PUNJAB CHIEF MINISTER SHAHBAZ SHARIF EMPHASIZED HIS </p><p>BROTHER\'S COMMITMENT TO FINDING COMMON GROUND WITH THE UNITED </p><p>STATES ON PROLIFERATION ISSUES, JUSTIFIED THE RECENT REDUCTION OF </p><p>ELECTRICITY TARIFFS AS A POLITICAL IMPERATIVE, AND DEFENDED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ISLAMIZATION AMENDMENT AS A POLITICAL TACTIC THAT </p><p>WOULD NOT ALTER PAKISTAN\'S HISTORICALLY MODERATE COURSE.  SHAHBAZ </p><p>RECALLED HIS MID-AUGUST MEETINGS WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT </p><p>AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON, AND CLAIMED THAT GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACTIONS SINCE THEN HAVE FOLLOWED PRECISELY THE ROADMAP WHICH HE </p><p>HAD DISCUSSED.  HE PROMISED IMMEDIATE PROGRESS ON EXPORT CONTROLS </p><p>BUT INDICATED THAT FURTHER MOVEMENT TOWARDS A FISSILE MATERIAL </p><p>CUT-OFF WOULD REQUIRE STEPS TO REDRESS THE INHERENT IMBALANCE OF </p><p>THE INDO-PAK SECURITY RELATIONSHIP.  IN A BRIEF ONE-ON-ONE, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR RAISED THE OSAMA BIN LADEN ISSUE IN AFGHANISTAN, URGED </p><p>SHAHBAZ TO SPEAK TO THE PM ABOUT INCREASING GOP EFFORTS TO </p><p>PERSUADE THE TALEBAN TO EXPEL OBL AND ABOUT THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY\'S RELUCTANCE TO ALLOW THE AMBASSADOR TO ENGAGE THE PM ON </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  SHAHBAZ AGREED TO TALK TO THE PM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE WAY FORWARD ON NON-PROLIFERATION </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AFTER A FOREIGN MINISTRY NOTETAKER WAS ESCORTED OUT OF THE </p><p>MEETING, SHAHBAZ SPOKE CANDIDLY AND AT LENGTH ABOUT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S PRIORITIES AND ITS HOPES FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  WE CAN\'T CHANGE HISTORY, THE CHIEF </p><p>MINISTER LAMENTED, BUT CLEARLY WE NEED TO GET BACK ON COURSE TO </p><p>FOCUS ON PAKISTAN\'S URGENT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) RECALLING HIS LATE SUMMER MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON, SHAHBAZ </p><p>ARGUED THAT GOP ACTIONS SINCE THEN HAVE FOLLOWED PRECISELY THE </p><p>"ROAD MAP" THAT HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT. </p><p>WE RECOGNIZE THERE IS MORE FOR US TO DO, SHAHBAZ CONTINUED.  SOME </p><p>STEPS, SUCH AS ENHANCING EXPORT CONTROLS, WE WOULD TAKE EVEN </p><p>WITHOUT YOUR PRESSURE.  THIS IS NO PROBLEM AT ALL.  OTHER STEPS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE FISSILE MATERIAL CUTOFF, REQUIRE THAT WE FIRST </p><p>DETERMINE HOW TO ACHIEVE MINIMUM DETERRENCE VIS-A-VIS INDIA.  WE </p><p>NEED TO REMEMBER THAT INDIA IS THE AGGRESSOR WHICH STARTED THE </p><p>CYCLE OF NUCLEAR TESTING.  IT FRUSTRATES US, SHAHBAZ ADDED, THAT </p><p>FRIENDS LIKE THE UNITED STATES SOMETIMES APPEAR TO OVERLOOK THIS </p><p>BASIC FACT.  WE HAVE TO KEEP WORKING IN GENEVA, BUT UNCONDITIONAL </p><p>PAKISTANI ADHERENCE TO THE FMCT IS A PROBLEM.  WE MUST FIND A WAY </p><p>TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCKPILES AND BRING SOME FORM OF PARITY TO OUR </p><p>SECURITY RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA, SHAHBAZ CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE THREE </p><p>PARTNERS IN THESE DELIBERATIONS, AMBASSADOR MILAM RESPONDED.  BUT </p><p>WE THINK FMCT IS THE RIGHT WAY FORWARD.  BOTH PAKISTAN AND INDIA </p><p>NEED TO BRING TRANSPARENCY TO THEIR NUCLEAR POLICIES.  SHAHBAZ </p><p>AGAIN CAME BACK TO THE POLITICS OF THE NON-PROLIFERATION DEBATE. </p><p>NAWAZ SHARIF MUST BE SEEN TO BE DEFENDING PAKISTAN\'S SUPREME </p><p>NATIONAL INTERESTS.  FOR THAT REASON, SHAHBAZ ARGUED, WHATEVER </p><p>STEPS ARE REQUIRED AND WHATEVER INDUCEMENTS THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY PROVIDES MUST BE VIEWED AS EQUITABLE AND FAIR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOUTH ASIA\'S KOSOVO </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) SHAHBAZ TURNED TO THE BROADER ISSUE OF INDO-PAK RELATIONS, </p><p>NOTING THAT "WE\'D BE LIVING IN A FOOLS PARADISE" TO SEEK PROGRESS </p><p>ON NON-PROLIFERATION WHILE IGNORING THE CONFRONTATION OVER </p><p>KASHMIR.  THIS WAS NOT WHAT INDIA AND PAKISTAN WERE MEANT TO BE, </p><p>SHAHBAZ CONTINUED, FIGHTING PROXY WARS AND SQUANDERING EACH </p><p>OTHER\'S ECONOMIC RESOURCES.  LOOK AT TRADE.  THINK HOW MUCH WE </p><p>COULD SAVE IF PAKISTAN WERE ABLE TO BUY COAL FROM INDIAN MINES </p><p>INSTEAD OF IMPORTING IT FROM THE AMERICAS.  BUT THAT\'S JUST NOT </p><p>POSSIBLE UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  WE CAN MOVE THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP TO A NEW LEVEL, BUT WE NEED YOU TO THROW YOUR WEIGHT </p><p>BEHIND A SETTLEMENT OF THE KASHMIR DISPUTE.  AS YOU HAVE DONE </p><p>WITH THE CONFLICT IN KOSOVO, THE UNITED STATES MUST BRING IT\'S </p><p>AUTHORITY TO BEAR ON THE KASHMIR DISPUTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE POWER IMBROGLIO </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AMBASSADOR MILAM RAISED THE ISSUE OF INDEPENDENT POWER </p><p>PROVIDERS (IPP\'S), NOTING OUR PUZZLEMENT ABOUT THE REDUCTION IN </p><p>CONSUMER ELECTRICITY RATES COMING IN THE MIDST OF DIFFICULT </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF.  WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REDUCE </p><p>ELECTRICITY TARIFFS, SHAHBAZ INSISTED.   FROM KHYBER TO KARACHI, </p><p>PAKISTANIS WERE CLAMORING FOR RELIEF FROM UTILITY BILLS THAT WERE </p><p>CONSUMING A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOMES.  PEOPLE </p><p>HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS.  THIS GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>NO INTENTION OF REVERSING THE MARKET-ORIENTED DIRECTION THAT THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER SET IN HIS FIRST MONTHS; THAT\'S NOT EVEN AN </p><p>PEOPLE A SENSE OF HOPE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) AS THE CONVERSATION DREW TO A CLOSE, THE CHIEF MINISTER </p><p>RAISED THE GOVERNMENT\'S CONTROVERSIAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON </p><p>ISLAMIZATION.  YOU HAVEN\'T BROUGHT IT UP, SO I WILL, SHAHBAZ </p><p>NOTED.  THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS GOVERNMENT\'S WESTERN, </p><p>LIBERAL ORIENTATION.  THAT\'S WHY I\'VE BEEN WEARING ALL MY OLD </p><p>WESTERN BUSINESS SUITS, HE JOKED, INSTEAD OF THE SHALWAR THAT </p><p>MOST PAKISTANI POLITICIANS TREAT AS THEIR UNIFORM.  SHAHBAZ ALSO </p><p>DREW ATTENTION HIS OCTOBER 14 SPEECH AT A WOMEN\'S ASSOCIATION </p><p>MEETING IN LAHORE WHERE HE HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE THAT FEMALE </p><p>MANAGERS, ADMINISTRATORS AND SCIENTISTS MUST PLAY IN PAKISTAN\'S </p><p>FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.  CAN WE THINK OF DEVELOPMENT INVOLVING WOMEN </p><p>WHO WEAR A VEIL OR SIT AT HOME, SHAHBAZ ASKED IN HIS SPEECH. </p><p>IT\'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) THERE SHOULD BE NO MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT OUR REASONS FOR </p><p>ADVANCING THE 15TH AMENDMENT, SHAHBAZ CONTINUED.  AFTER WESTERN </p><p>PRESSURE ON CTBT AND THE AIR STRIKES ON AFGHANISTAN, THE </p><p>RELIGIOUS PARTIES WERE RIDING HIGH.  BUT THIS ONE ACTION OF </p><p>INTRODUCING THE ISLAMIZATION AMENDMENT HAS TAKEN THE WIND OUT OF </p><p>THEIR SAILS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IN A BRIEF ONE-ON-ONE THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED HIS </p><p>INCREASING PREOCCUPATION WITH AFGHANISTAN, AND ESPECIALLY THE </p><p>ISSUE OF THE TALEBAN HARBORING OSAMA BIN LADEN.  THIS IS A VERY </p><p>BIG ISSUE TO THE U.S., AND OUR SENSE IS THAT, PERHAPS, WITH ADDED </p><p>PUSH THE U.S., PAKISTAN AND SAUDI ARABIA CAN PERSUADE THE TALEBAN </p><p>TO EXPEL OBL.  WE NEED A STRONGER PUSH ON THIS BY THE GOP.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR HAD TRIED TO SEE THE PM ON THIS BUT WAS BEING SCREENED </p><p>OFF BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED SHAHBAZ TO </p><p>TALK TO THE PM ABOUT THIS.  THE CHIEF MINISTER SAID HE WOULD. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) IN BOTH THIS MEETING AND A SUBSEQUENT LUNCH WITH HIS </p><p>SENIOR ADVISORS, SHAHBAZ DISPLAYED THE MIXTURE OF IMPATIENCE AND </p><p>REFORMIST ZEAL THAT HAVE BECOME HIS HALLMARK.  COMPARED EVEN TO </p><p>THE LAST MEETING WITH HIM IN LATE AUGUST (REFTEL), WE FOUND HIM </p><p>MORE CONVERSANT AND MORE WILLING TO VENTURE AN OPINION ON THE </p><p>SECURITY ISSUES THAT FORM THE CORE OF THE U.S.-PAKISTAN BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  IMPLICIT IN THE SCOPE OF OUR TWO HOUR CONVERSATION </p><p>AND LUNCH WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WITHOUT PROGRESS ON NON- </p><p>PROLIFERATION AND THE RELATED SANCTIONS, THE EXPERIMENT IN LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT REFORM THAT SHAHBAZ HAS LAUNCHED IN PUNJAB (LIKE THE </p><p>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITSELF) MAY COME CRASHING TO THE GROUND. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MILAM </p><p></p></div>
