<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001471 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, </p><p>CA, CA/OCS/NEASA, DS, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/IP/NEA, </p><p>DSERCC, S/CT, INR AND M </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 03/28/13 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, KHLS, PTER, PREL, EAID, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01 (EAC): ABU DHABI SITREP NO. 8, MARCH 28 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABU DHABI 1461 AND PREVIOUS     B) STATE 79964 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) COM convened Abu Dhabi\'s Iraq Task Force/core </p><p>Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, 3/28 to </p><p>review recent threat reporting that potential Iraqi sleeper </p><p>cells are operating in and could take action in the UAE </p><p>during the period of 27-29 March (ref B).  The Task </p><p>Force/EAC agreed that Embassy Abu Dhabi, FCS (located </p><p>outside of the Embassy compound), and the USGS office in Al </p><p>Ain will open as usual 3/29 with full staffing. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) ORCA provided background to ref B threat </p><p>reporting and emphasized that more information regarding </p><p>the specific threat to U.S. interests in the UAE would be </p><p>forthcoming during the next few days. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF) Concerned that a similar attack (in terms of </p><p>timing, targets, choice of weapons, etc.) may be planned </p><p>for the UAE, the Ambassador on 3/27 requested UAE Armed </p><p>Forces Chief of Staff Shaykh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan </p><p>to increase security at the Embassy compound and Embassy </p><p>residences.  RSO echoed this request with his contacts at </p><p>the Abu Dhabi Police Department: stationary armed guards </p><p>are now posted at the DCM, PAO, P/M, DATT residences, and </p><p>additional undercover CID and roving police patrols are </p><p>monitoring Embassy staff residences. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF) Based on the new threat reporting, USLO has </p><p>implemented a Force Protection Condition upgrade to Delta </p><p>for all U.S. military non-combatants in the UAE.  Al- </p><p>Dhahfra airbase has remained on FPCon Delta since the onset </p><p>of hostilities in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>UAEG Actions/Statements </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF) Shaykh Mohammed Bin Zayid assured the Ambassador </p><p>3/27 that he takes this threat reporting very seriously, </p><p>and UAE security services are keeping a close watch on all </p><p>Iraqi diplomats, known Mukhabarat, and personnel from Iraqi </p><p>front-companies in the UAE.  Following the discovery of a </p><p>cache of weapons and explosives in the Iraqi Embassy here </p><p>during the 1991 Gulf War, the UAEG has been X-raying all </p><p>Iraqi diplomatic pouches coming into the country for at </p><p>least the last several years. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF) Director of State Security Shaykh Hazza Bin </p><p>Zayid Al-Nayhan confirmed to ORCA that one of the men named </p><p>in the investigation in Sanaa as a possible Iraqi agent </p><p>operating in the UAE is known to State Security and has not </p><p>been allowed to enter the country for many years.  State </p><p>Security continues to search for the other suspects named </p><p>in the investigation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Consular/ American Citizen Issues </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Ambassador noted that, unlike in Yemen, there </p><p>are many more high-profile American companies, hotels, and </p><p>schools in the UAE.  In order to minimize the threat to </p><p>soft targets, RSO continues to work with the police for </p><p>increased armed guard coverage at the American Community </p><p>School in Abu Dhabi, the FCS satellite office, and the </p><p>construction site for the New Embassy Compound.  (Note: </p><p>USGS in Al-Ain already has a dedicated security guard as </p><p>per its contract with the UAEG.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The Task Force/EAC agreed that the general "safety </p><p>and security" warden message disseminated by CONS on 3/27 </p><p>is sufficient for now. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Abu Dhabi Iraq Task Force/EAC will reconvene at </p><p>1000 local time, 3/29. </p><p>11.  (U) Iraq Task Force/EAC members in attendance included </p><p>AMB, DCM, RSO, DAO, P/M, POL, ECON, CONS, PAO, USLO. </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
