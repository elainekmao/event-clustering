<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 002080 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. </p><p>MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  11-05-2002 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, EAID, PINR, CE, NO, TH, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: Reviewing recent talks, Norwegian envoy upbeat, </p><p>but stresses that process still has long way to go </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Bangkok 7737 </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 2064, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In a November 4 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Wills, Norwegian Ambassador Westborg was </p><p>upbeat about the recently concluded second session of </p><p>GSL-LTTE talks, but stressed that the process still had </p><p>a long way to go.  He took note of the LTTE\'s apparent </p><p>downgrading of its long-standing demand for an "interim </p><p>administration" and the group\'s willingness to </p><p>participate in a sub-committee on political issues.  He </p><p>confirmed that the sub-committee on humanitarian issues </p><p>would be a decision-making body.  Westborg hoped that </p><p>Muslim-LTTE relations would improve due to the talks and </p><p>he provided insights on LTTE dynamics.  Unlike some of </p><p>the effusive press coverage, Westborg\'s review was sober </p><p>and we thought it hit the mark.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Westborg:  Upbeat but Cautious </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador Wills, accompanied by polchief, met </p><p>late November 4 with Norwegian Ambassador Jon Westborg, </p><p>a member of the GoN peace facilitation team at the just- </p><p>concluded second session of talks held between the Sri </p><p>Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE).  (Note:  The talks took place October 31 - </p><p>November 3 at a hotel outside of Bangkok -- See </p><p>Reftels.)  Westborg was upbeat about the outcome of the </p><p>talks.  "The two sides accomplished many small things, </p><p>which added up to a lot," he commented.  These </p><p>accomplishments had been achieved despite two </p><p>"torpedoes" that could have broken up the talks.  First, </p><p>the LTTE side did not let a Colombo court\'s recent </p><p>conviction in absentia of its leader, V. Prabhakaran, of </p><p>involvement in a 1996 terror attack disrupt the talks </p><p>(see Ref B).  Second, the LTTE reacted calmly to the </p><p>news that six of its cadre had been arrested carrying </p><p>arms off the eastern coast on November 1. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Despite the positive outcome of the talks, </p><p>Westborg stressed that it was important not to get </p><p>carried away.  Some of the press coverage had been too </p><p>effusive in asserting, for example, that the talks had </p><p>led to a "breakthrough" for the peace process.  "The </p><p>process still has a very long way to go and everyone </p><p>should realize that," Westborg underlined.  Caution in </p><p>these type of situations was important, as many things </p><p>could happen.  The Ambassador noted that he appreciated </p><p>Westborg\'s sober assessment, adding that Norway deserved </p><p>congratulations for keeping the process together and </p><p>increasing its momentum. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>"Interim Administration," Political Sub-Committee </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Asked for other insights into the talks, </p><p>Westborg replied that it was important not to overlook </p><p>LTTE senior negotiator Anton Balasingham\'s comment that </p><p>the group "may or may not" support formation of an </p><p>"interim administration" for the north and east.  (Note: </p><p>See Ref B Para 4 for the text of Balasingham\'s remark, </p><p>which was made at the November 3 press conference </p><p>concluding the talks.)  The peace track has had its ups- </p><p>and-downs over the years, but one constant has been the </p><p>LTTE\'s demand for the setting up of an interim </p><p>administration to be followed down the road by a final </p><p>settlement, he noted.  While not foreclosing on that </p><p>demand, Balasingham\'s comment called it into question. </p><p>In doing this, Westborg related, the LTTE seemed to be </p><p>acknowledging that the whole issue of an interim </p><p>administration had become more trouble than it might be </p><p>worth.  There was serious opposition in the south to the </p><p>notion that the GSL would turn over the north and east </p><p>to an administration effectively controlled by the LTTE. </p><p>In addition, Westborg commented, the LTTE was probably </p><p>becoming worried that if it was given control of an </p><p>interim administration it would actually have to govern. </p><p>The group probably realized that this would be difficult </p><p>to do, especially in areas it was not in total armed </p><p>control of, and it did not want to be called to account. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The LTTE\'s apparent downgrading of the need for </p><p>an interim administration was matched in importance by </p><p>its acceptance of the idea of forming a sub-committee on </p><p>political matters, Westborg remarked.  (Note:  At the </p><p>talks, the GSL and the LTTE agreed to set up three sub- </p><p>committees focused on political, humanitarian and de- </p><p>escalation issues -- See Reftels.)  What was especially </p><p>important about this sub-committee\'s ambit, he </p><p>continued, was that it would reach for "broad political </p><p>understandings."  The sub-committee also could meet at </p><p>any time the parties wanted it to, not only at plenary </p><p>sessions of the talks. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In the short-term, Westborg allowed, the </p><p>formation of the sub-committee would also undercut </p><p>President Kumaratunga\'s public assertion that the talks </p><p>were not dealing with "core" issues.  (Note:  FYI: </p><p>Westborg said he planned to brief Kumaratunga on the </p><p>talks on November 5.)  This was an advantage for the </p><p>government.  In the longer term, the political sub- </p><p>committee could also be the forum where the LTTE and GSL </p><p>tackle tough issues related to managing the north and </p><p>east until a final settlement is reached, particularly </p><p>if the idea of forming an interim administration is </p><p>dropped. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In reference to "core" issues, the Ambassador </p><p>asked whether the issue of decommissioning of LTTE </p><p>weapons had been raised.  Westborg replied that it had </p><p>not, but he acknowledged that it was an issue that would </p><p>have to be addressed in the future.  Ambassador Wills </p><p>agreed, noting that the idea that the LTTE might </p><p>maintain an army and a navy would be controversial, </p><p>indeed unacceptable, in the south.  It would be </p><p>understandable if the group wanted to have a police </p><p>force, but a military force would add an element of </p><p>unpredictability that would prove tough to digest.  The </p><p>Ambassador added that any notion that the Sri Lankan </p><p>security forces would completely withdraw from the north </p><p>and east, as some pro-LTTE Tamils were advocating, was </p><p>also a non-starter. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Review of Humanitarian Sub-Committee </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Shifting focus, Westborg also reviewed what the </p><p>two sides had agreed to regarding the  "Immediate </p><p>Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs in the North and </p><p>East" Sub-Committee.  He underscored that this sub- </p><p>committee had replaced the "joint task force" ("JTF") </p><p>idea (which had been agreed to at the first session of </p><p>talks in mid-September).  The humanitarian sub-committee </p><p>would deal with the same issues as the "JTF," however. </p><p>It would be a joint government-LTTE "decision-making </p><p>body" for prioritizing and disbursing assistance to the </p><p>north and east, he stated.  What was slightly different </p><p>was that the sub-committee was part and parcel of the </p><p>peace talks, and not some quasi-independent body, which </p><p>was what the "JTF" was being made out to be by some </p><p>critics.  The sub-committee would report to the Sri </p><p>Lankan prime minister and the LTTE, but would not </p><p>require parliamentary oversight. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The Ambassador noted that the U.S. had not yet </p><p>made up its mind about the new sub-committee.  Because </p><p>of the LTTE\'s involvement, we reserved judgment at this </p><p>time, he noted.  Westborg replied that he understood </p><p>that, but wanted to stress that the sub-committee would </p><p>be focused on "helping the people of the north and </p><p>east."  If it was backed by donors and was successful, </p><p>the sub-committee could reinforce the ceasefire and help </p><p>the peace process gain traction.  In addition, via its </p><p>participation in the sub-committee, the LTTE would be </p><p>obliged to respect human rights norms, and be otherwise </p><p>accountable to the populace in the north and east.  The </p><p>Ambassador replied that he appreciated that explanation, </p><p>but the U.S. would have to study the issue further. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Muslim/LTTE Ties </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Questioned about LTTE-Muslim relations, </p><p>Westborg said he hoped that the situation would improve </p><p>due to the talks.  The LTTE and Rauf Hakeem, a senior </p><p>minister and the Muslim representative on the GSL team, </p><p>had agreed to consult closely and to energize local </p><p>"peace committees" focused on ironing out problems.  The </p><p>LTTE had made the right noises about wanting to work </p><p>with the Muslim community.  That said, Westborg </p><p>continued, it was still unclear whether Hakeem really </p><p>had control of Muslim opinion or whether he remained in </p><p>danger of being sidelined by radicals within his own </p><p>party.  It was important that Hakeem rise to the </p><p>occasion and begin to articulate his views better to </p><p>Muslims in the east.  There was a lot of distrust toward </p><p>Hakeem, however, with many in the east seeing him as an </p><p>outsider.  (Note:  Hakeem is not from the east -- see </p><p>below.)  In an effort to assist Hakeem, Westborg said he </p><p>planned to brief eastern Muslims on the results of the </p><p>talks soon. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) (((Note:  In a brief story highlighting </p><p>Hakeem\'s apparent lack of understanding of the east, </p><p>Westborg related the following:  Karuna, the LTTE </p><p>military commander in the east, had mentioned at the </p><p>talks the group\'s intent to return to Muslims their </p><p>farmland in the east.  Hakeem had not picked up on the </p><p>importance of this pledge, however, and had to have it </p><p>pointed out to him.  Westborg explained that to Hakeem </p><p>the issue of Muslims and land did not click, as he was </p><p>from Kandy and Colombo where Muslims were mostly </p><p>involved in trade and the professions.  In the east, </p><p>however, a good percentage of Muslims owned farmland, </p><p>but Hakeem did not seem to realize this.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>LTTE Dynamics </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Queried about the dynamics of the LTTE </p><p>delegation at the talks, Westborg said it was clear that </p><p>S.P. Thamilchelvam, the chief of the LTTE\'s political </p><p>wing, was an important player.  Thamilchelvam was </p><p>clearly very close to Prabhakaran and felt comfortable </p><p>taking decisions on some issues.  That was not the case </p><p>with Balasingham, the ostensible leader of the </p><p>delegation, who felt compelled to refer all issues, even </p><p>small ones, back to the Wanni (the LTTE-controlled area </p><p>in northern Sri Lanka).  As for Karuna, Westborg said he </p><p>was clearly important in the east, but he was not a key </p><p>LTTE player on overall political strategy. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) With respect to Prabhakaran, Westborg said he </p><p>was not sure what made him tick, but the LTTE seemed to </p><p>be edging closer than ever to supporting autonomy within </p><p>Sri Lanka and not separatism.  In agreeing to move along </p><p>the peace track, Prabhakaran seemingly was reacting to </p><p>pressure from his supporters, both those at home and </p><p>abroad.  Politics was complicated in the Wanni and </p><p>Westerners made a mistake in thinking that Prabhakaran </p><p>was all-powerful simply because of his brutal record. </p><p>He was more like an "Oriental potentate," who was </p><p>obliged to work in sophisticated, cunning fashion to </p><p>gain support from often competing groups.  Asked what </p><p>Prabhakaran might do in case peace was achieved, </p><p>Westborg replied that he would probably "go into </p><p>reserve," i.e., he would not be the public face of the </p><p>Tigers.  Instead, he might pull the strings from behind </p><p>the scene as Mao did for much of his rule in China. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Unlike some of the effusive press coverage, </p><p>Westborg\'s review was sober and we thought it hit the </p><p>mark.  The talks have made solid progress, but there </p><p>have only been two full plenaries.  There is still </p><p>plenty of room for disagreement between the two sides on </p><p>a slew of make-or-break issues.  We expect that much of </p><p>the give-and-take will now be channeled into the various </p><p>sub-committees.  That, however, would be a real </p><p>accomplishment in and of itself because the Norwegians </p><p>have clearly convinced both sides to buy into a process. </p><p>Westborg noted that the process has not yet suffered any </p><p>major reverses.  With the peace process taking on a life </p><p>of its own, however, serious bumps in the road just may </p><p>be controllable as disagreements are channeled into the </p><p>sub-committees or elsewhere.  All of this argues for the </p><p>likely viability of the peace process into the near- </p><p>term.  Nonetheless, even Westborg -- who has as much </p><p>experience as any outsider in dealing with the LTTE -- </p><p>still cannot say for sure what the group\'s long-term </p><p>intentions are.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
