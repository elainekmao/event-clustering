<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001919 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2017 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, EFIN, PINR, NI, UK, US </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA\'S OBASANJO SEEKING WARMER RELATIONS WITH </p><p>U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1913 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASON:  1.5(B) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: President Obasanjo senses a loss of warmth </p><p>in Nigeria\'s relationship with the U.S. and feels the U.S. </p><p>and U.K. are frustrating his efforts by setting too tough </p><p>terms for support, according to his VP. Obasanjo reportedly </p><p>blames reports from Embassy Abuja and the British High </p><p>Commission.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Vice President Atiku Abubakar told CDA privately </p><p>evening of March 24 that, shortly before departing for the </p><p>U.S., President Obasanjo had expressed disappointment and </p><p>sadness at what he felt was waning warmth in the bilateral </p><p>relationship. Obasanjo had expected more support for his debt </p><p>relief entreaties - not just from the U.S., but also from the </p><p>U.K.  Instead, Obasanjo found attitudes in Washington and </p><p>London hardening, and, Atiku added, Obasanjo attributed this </p><p>shift in attitude to reports being filed by Embassy Abuja and </p><p>the British High Commission here.  Obasanjo felt he was going </p><p>in the right direction, and that greater flexibility from the </p><p>U.S. and U.K. would be in order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Atiku said that he had spoken only briefly with </p><p>Obasanjo since the latter\'s return from the U.S. and Libya </p><p>because he (Atiku) had taken a few days\' break at Yankari </p><p>National Park (his first-ever trip there).  However, the </p><p>President felt his visit was satisfactory, notwithstanding </p><p>President Bush\'s unavailability for a private one-on-one </p><p>conversation.  Obasanjo appreciated the President\'s plans to </p><p>visit Africa next year and looked forward to the trip.  The </p><p>meeting with Secretary Powell had gone well, and Obasanjo </p><p>attributed this at least in part to his decision to announce </p><p>that Nigeria would resume relations with the IMF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CDA commented that, in light of 9/11, Nigeria should </p><p>not expect the Bush Administration to give Nigeria the same </p><p>attention that its predecessor had been able to offer.  The </p><p>world had changed on 9/11, especially for the U.S., and our </p><p>President had to focus intently on homeland security.  This </p><p>new, overriding priority meant President Bush did not have as </p><p>much time for other issues as he would like to have, but that </p><p>fact should not be misunderstood as lack of warmth or </p><p>concern.  On the contrary, the U.S. remained strongly engaged </p><p>in Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: We suspect that what irked President </p><p>Obasanjo skin may have been a May 24 meeting at which </p><p>Ambassador Isaac Aluko-Olukun of Nigeria\'s National Planning </p><p>Commission briefed G-7 Heads of Mission on NePAD (reftel). </p><p>Aluko-Olukun called for more G-7 carrots and fewer sticks; he </p><p>particularly wanted support for building infrastructure. </p><p>British Acting High Commissioner Bird raised serious problems </p><p>of corruption and lack of transparency.  CDA followed up by </p><p>asking Aluko-Olukun to describe what practical, effective </p><p>steps were being taken to address these problems.  Obasanjo </p><p>may have been annoyed, but he seems to have recognized that </p><p>re-engagement with the IMF would be a useful step.  Today\'s </p><p>$64,000 question asks whether this announcement is purely </p><p>symbolic, portending a renewed "dialogue", or presages GON </p><p>interest in genuine reform, the stresses of an election year </p><p>notwithstanding. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
