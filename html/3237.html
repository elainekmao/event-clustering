<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003240 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IT, IS, XF </p><p>SUBJECT: BERLUSCONI BACKS THE PRESIDENT\'S JUNE 24 SPEECH ON </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 3217 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03240  031226Z </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING POL MC GARY ROBBINS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: ACCORDING TO HIS DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR, </p><p>PM AND ACTING FM BERLUSCONI REACTED VERY POSITIVELY TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S JUNE 24 SPEECH ON THE MIDDLE EAST.  BERLUSCONI </p><p>AGREED THAT THE PA NEEDED A NEW LEADERSHIP, AND STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM FOR </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  ON THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE, </p><p>BERLUSCONI, WHO HAD EXPRESSED SERIOUS INTEREST IN HOSTING THE </p><p>CONFERENCE THIS SUMMER, HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE CURRENT </p><p>CLIMATE WAS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR HOLDING A SUCCESSFUL PEACE </p><p>CONFERENCE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>ON THE PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH AND ARAFAT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON JULY 2, POLOFF MET PAOLO DIONISI, BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR, WHO ACCOMPANIED THE ITALIAN PM ON </p><p>THE JUNE 26-27 G8 SUMMIT.  DIONISI SAID THAT BERLUSCONI </p><p>PRAISED THE PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH AS "STRONG AND ENGAGED" AND AS </p><p>THE FIRST PUBLIC CALL FOR A CHANGE IN PA LEADERSHIP.  THE </p><p>METAPHOR BERLUSCONI USED IS ONE HE BORROWED FROM AVRAHAM </p><p>BURG, PRESIDENT OF THE ISRAELI KNESSET, WHOM HE HAD MET IN </p><p>ROME ON JUNE 19: "THE ISRAELIS ASK THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY </p><p>DON\'T RUN THE RISK OF FALLING INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY </p><p>NEGOTIATE THE SALE OF GOODS WITH THE OWNER OF THE SHOP, REACH </p><p>AN AGREEMENT ON THE COST WITH HIM, AND THEN HIS EMPLOYEES </p><p>REFUSE TO DELIVER THESE GOODS."  BERLUSCONI STRESSED THAT THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS DESPERATELY NEEDED INSTITUTIONAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORMS.  HE CALLED FOR A NEW PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP AND FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03240  031226Z </p><p>ELECTIONS TO BE HELD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  MEANWHILE HOWEVER, </p><p>UNTIL A NEW PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP WAS ELECTED BY THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS, THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE TO DEALING WITH ARAFAT </p><p>IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE ELECTED LEADER OF THE PA, STRESSED </p><p>BERLUSCONI. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>ON THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BERLUSCONI STILL BELIEVED IN THE IMPORTANCE OF AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE, AND WAS STILL WILLING TO HOST </p><p>IT AND PAY FOR IT.  HOWEVER, BERLUSCONI NO LONGER FELT THAT </p><p>THE CURRENT CLIMATE WAS THE RIGHT ONE TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL </p><p>CONFERENCE.  HE FELT THAT THE PA DID NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE </p><p>KIND OF RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP NEEDED FOR A SUCCESSFUL </p><p>CONFERENCE, AND REEMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR THE PALESTINIANS TO </p><p>ELECT A NEW LEADERSHIP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: THE JUNE 26-27 G8 SUMMIT IN KANANASKIS MARKED </p><p>A METAMORPHOSIS IN BERLUSCONI\'S POSITION ON ARAFAT (REF) AND </p><p>ON THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE, WHICH HE HAD </p><p>PREVIOUSLY STAUNCHLY SUPPORTED AND OFFERED TO HOST.  AMONG </p><p>THE LEADERS PRESENT AT THE G8 SUMMIT, BERLUSCONI APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE EXPRESSED SOME OF THE STRONGEST SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S PLAN ON THE MIDDLE EAST.  ALTHOUGH HE IS NOW </p><p>STEPPING BACK FROM HIS NEAR-TERM PLAN FOR AN ERICE </p><p>CONFERENCE, BERLUSCONI WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO </p><p>PLAY A HELPFUL, HIGH-PROFILE, ROLE.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03240  031226Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03240 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
