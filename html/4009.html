HE OUTLINED THREE OPTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>-- PLAN A - A JOINT INVESTIGATION BY SPDC, NLD AND ETHNIC </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES (ALL AGREED THIS IS A NON-STARTER) </p><p>-- PLAN B - AN INVESTIGATION (THE TERM FACT-FINDING IS </p><p>PREFERRED AS "INVESTIGATION" REALLY RAISES THE GOB\'S HACKLES) </p><p>BY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORS OPERATING UNDER PINHEIRO\'S UNSR </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS MANDATE (TO INCLUDE PARTICIPATION BY THE UNSR </p><p>FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN) </p><p>-- PLAN C  - REQUEST A NEW UN MANDATE FOR THE SPECIFIC AND </p><p>SOLE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING THE SHAN RAPE ALLEGATIONS (THIS </p><p>WOULD TAKE PLACE IF AT ALL, IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE AS </p><p>OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD NOT BE NOT HIGH ON THE CURRENT UN AGENDA) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) AFTER SOLICITING COMMENTS FROM THE VARIOUS MEMBERS </p><p>AROUND THE TABLE, PLAN B (JUST AS IN REFTEL) PINHEIRO AGREED </p><p>THAT PLAN B IS THE ONLY OPTION THAT WOULD SATISFY THE GOB\'S </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ONLY OPTION </p><p>THAT THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNITY WOULD FIND </p><p>CREDIBLE.  PINHEIRO STATED THAT HE WOULD PUT THIS PROPOSAL tO </p><p>THE GOB IN COURTEOUS BUT VERY STRONG TERMS AND WOULD ADVISE </p><p>THEM THAT IF THEY DID NOT AGREE, THEN HIS UPCOMING REPORT TO </p><p>THE UN WOULD BE VERY HARSH. </p><p> </p><p>4.

(SBU) PER REFTEL, PINHEIRO STRESSED THAT FUNDING COULD BE </p><p>A STUMBLING BLOCK AND ASKED FOR REASSURANCES THAT FUNDS WOULD </p><p>BE FORTHCOMING, ASSURANCES THAT HE RECEIVED VERY CLEARLY FROM </p><p>THE U.S., AUSTRALIAN, AND U.K COM\'S PRESENT, AND WITH SOME </p><p>INDICATION FROM OTHERS AROUND THE TABLE THAT THEY WOULD ALSO </p><p>BE WILLING TO FUND. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) SR PINHEIRO SAID THAT THE GOB HAD PLANNED A VERY </p><p>FULL PROGRAM FOR HIM IN SHAN STATE BUT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF </p><p>GOING THERE.  HE SAID HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DISCOVER </p><p>ANYTHING DURING HIS CURRENT VISIT CONDITIONS AND THE GOB </p><p>WOULD USE A VISIT TO SHAN STATE AS A "BENEDICTION" OF THEIR </p><p>ACTIONS.  HE ALSO COMPLAINED THAT HE WAS VERY IRRITATED THAT </p><p>SPDC SPOKESMAN HLA MIN HAD BEEN TOUTING HIS VISIT AS BEING A </p><p>RESPONSE TO A GOB INVITATION TO INVESTIGATE THE RAPE </p><p>ALLEGATIONS.  PINHEIRO SAID THIS WAS PART OF HIS NORMAL </p><p>SCHEDULE OF SR VISITS AND NOT PREDICATED ON INVESTIGATING THE </p><p>RAPE ALLEGATIONS. </p><p>7.  (SBU) PINHEIRO WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO </p><p>FOLLOW THE GOB\'S VERY DETAILED PLAN FOR HIS VISIT BUT WOULD </p><p>PURSUE HIS OWN AGENDA IN ADDITION TO AN OUTBRIEF FOR THE SAME </p><p>GROUP HE MET WITH TODAY, HE ASKED TO MEET WITH COM PRIVATELY </p><p>THIS WEEKEND TO PROVIDE A READOUT AFTER HIS FIRST FEW DAYS </p><p>HERE AND TO DISCUSS OUR FINDINGS IN RELATION TO THE RECENT </p><p>VISIT OF DRL/IRF\'S PAUL MARTIN.               . </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) COMMENT:  SR PINHEIRO\'S MESSAGE WAS CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>THE POSITIONS HE EXPRESSED IN HIS RECENT MEETINGS WITH EAP </p><p>DAS MATT DALEY AND DRL A/S LORNE CRANER.  WE WILL STAY IN </p><p>CLOSE CONTACT WITH PINHEIRO DURING THIS VISIT AND STRESS THAT </p><p>HE MUST NOT STEP BACK FROM CONFRONTING THE GOB AND EXERTING </p><p>EVERY PRESSURE TO MAKE THEM AGREE TO THE OHCHR INVESTIGATIVE </p><p>TEAM. END COMMENT. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
