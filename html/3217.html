END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>TIMETABLE FOR COMMISSION AND INTERIM GOVERNING BODY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>2.  THE FAO COMMISSION ON GENETIC RESOURCES FOR FOOD AND </p><p>AGRICULTURE WILL MEET IN ROME OCTOBER 9-18, 2002. A </p><p>FORMAL INVITATION LETTER SHOULD BE SENT OUT NEXT MONTH. </p><p>THE FAO SECRETARIAT INTENDS TO CONVENE THE FIRST SESSION </p><p>OF THE INTERIM GOVERNING BODY (IGB) OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TREATY ON PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES DURING THE FIRST THREE </p><p>DAYS.  THE REST OF THE COMMISSION\'S BUSINESS WILL BE </p><p>HANDLED OCTOBER 13-18 (THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS FOR WORK </p><p>OVER THE WEEKEND OF OCTOBER 11-12, BUT THIS MAY IN FACT </p><p>OCCUR). </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS OF THE COMMISSION WILL BE </p><p>TO APPROVE ITS NEW BUREAU AND THEN SUSPEND THE SESSION TO </p><p>START THE FIRST SESSION OF THE IGB.   COMMENT: CONCERNING </p><p>THE COMMISSION BUREAU, ACCORDING TO NORMAL FAO PRACTICE, </p><p>THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AGREED AHEAD OF TIME BETWEEN THE </p><p>REGIONAL GROUPS.  WHILE THERE IS NO STRICT ROTATION </p><p>BETWEEN REGIONAL GROUPS FOR CHAIRMANSHIPS AT THE FAO, IT </p><p>IS RECOGNIZED THAT ALL REGIONAL GROUPS SHOULD HAVE AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO CHAIR THE FAO COMMISSIONS.  THE NORTH </p><p>AMERICAN GROUP AND THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC GROUP ARE THE </p><p>ONLY TWO REGIONAL GROUPS NOT TO HAVE CHAIRED THE </p><p>COMMISSION SINCE ITS CREATION.  THE U.S. EXPRESSED </p><p>INTEREST IN CHAIRING THE COMMISSION DURING A 2001 MEETING </p><p>OF THE ROME/OECD GROUP (WHICH IS CHARGED WITH DISCUSSING </p><p>BUREAU POSITIONS AMONG OECD MEMBER COUNTRIES.) THIS HAS </p><p>NOT YET BEEN DISCUSSED IN AN OECD MEETING IN 2002. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>AGENDA FOR THE INTERIM GOVERNING BODY (IGB) </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>4.  THE IGB WILL HAVE BEFORE IT THE WORK PROGRAM SET OUT </p><p>IN THE RESOLUTION ADOPTED AT THE FAO CONFERENCE IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 2001 ALONG WITH THE TREATY. THIS COMPRISES: </p><p> </p><p>-- ELECTION OF THE BUREAU OF THE IGB.  THE COMMISSION </p><p>ITSELF FOLLOWS THE PRACTICE OF HAVING A BUREAU MEMBER </p><p>FROM EACH FAO REGION (LATIN AMERICA, NORTH AMERICA, ASIA, </p><p>NEAR EAST, SOUTHWEST PACIFIC, AFRICA AND EUROPE).  THE </p><p>IGB IS FREE TO FOLLOW THIS PRACTICE OR USE ANOTHER ONE </p><p>(I.E., THE COMMISSION IN THE PAST USED ANOTHER BUREAU </p><p>COMPOSITION COMPRISING ONLY A CHAIR AND TWO VICE-CHAIRS). </p><p>COMMENT:  WE EXPECT THAT MEMBERS WILL SUPPORT THE FIRST </p><p>ALTERNATIVE AS ASSURING EQUITABLE REGIONAL </p><p>REPRESENTATION.  MISOFF SPOKE WITH CANADIAN REP BRAD </p><p>FRALEIGH DURING THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT:FIVE YEARS LATER </p><p>MEETING IN JUNE AND HE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN SERVING ON </p><p>THE IGB BUREAU AS THE NORTH AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVE. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--THE ADOPTION OF RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE IGB.  THE </p><p>IGB MAY DECIDE TO USE THE COMMISSION RULES OF PROCEDURE </p><p>(WHICH PROVIDE FOR VOTING IN THE EVENT CONSENSUS IS NOT </p><p>REACHED) OR CHOOSE TO ADOPT CONSENSUS AS A RULE FOR THE </p><p>IGB.  COMMENT:  SINCE THE INTERNATIONAL TREATY (IT) HAS </p><p>CONSENSUS AS THE RULE, IT SEEMS REASONABLE THAT THE IGB </p><p>WOULD FOLLOW THE SAME PROCEDURE. </p><p> </p><p>-- AGREEMENT ON DRAFT FINANCIAL RULES FOR THE IT: THE FAO </p><p>WILL PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF FINANCIAL RULES FROM OTHER FAO </p><p>BODIES SIMILAR TO THE IT GOVERNING BODY (TUNA COMMISSION, </p><p>EUROPEAN FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE COMMISSION) AND MEMBERS </p><p>MAY DECIDE WHICH FINANCIAL RULES WILL BE MOST APPROPRIATE </p><p>FOR THE GOVERNING BODY. </p><p> </p><p>-- AGREEMENT ON DRAFT RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE IT: IN </p><p>THIS CASE THE FAO WILL HAVE FEWER EXAMPLES TO DRAW ON </p><p>SINCE MOST BODIES USE THE FAO RULES OF PROCEDURE AND THE </p><p>IT ALREADY PROVIDES THAT CONSENSUS WILL BE THE RULE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE WILL BE DISCUSSION OF THOSE ITEMS WHERE, </p><p>BY CONSENSUS, MEMBERS ARRIVE AT ANOTHER DECISION-MAKING </p><p>METHOD. </p><p> </p><p>-- AGREEMENT ON THE TERMS OF REFERENCE (TOR) FOR THE </p><p>EXPERT GROUP TO DRAFT THE PROPOSED MATERIAL TRANSFER </p><p>AGREEMENT (MTA).  THE FAO SECRETARIAT WILL SUGGEST THAT </p><p>THE U.S.-DRAFTED TERMS OF REFERENCE BE CIRCULATED AS AN </p><p>INFO DOCUMENT UNDER THIS AGENDA ITEM. </p><p> </p><p>-- OTHER ITEMS: THE WORK PLAN THAT THE IGB UNDERTAKES TO </p><p>PREPARE FOR THE FIRST SESSION OF THE GOVERNING BODY (GB) </p><p>ALSO INCLUDES: A PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THE IT, PROPOSED </p><p>PROCEDURES TO PROMOTE COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE 21 AND </p><p>PREPARATION OF DRAFT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS (IARCS) AND THE GOVERNING </p><p>BODY.  COMMENT:  IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE IGB WILL HAVE </p><p>TIME TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN THIS SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>AGENDA FOR THE COMMISSION ON GENETIC RESOURCES FOR FOOD </p><p>AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE FOLLOWING ITEMS WILL BE CONSIDERED DURING THE </p><p>SUBSEQUENT COMMISSION SESSION: </p><p> </p><p>-- REPORT OF THE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP ON PLANT GENETIC </p><p>RESOURCES (TWGPGR), TO INCLUDE ITEMS COVERED IN ITS JULY </p><p>2001 MEETING: FUNCTIONING OF THE GLOBAL SYSTEM, THE STATE </p><p>OF THE WORLD\'S PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES, THE EARLY WARNING </p><p>SYSTEM AND THE IN-SITU NETWORK. THIS WILL INCLUDE THE </p><p>REVISED REPORT ON GENETIC END USE TECHNOLOGY (GURTS). </p><p>COMMENT:  THE GURTS REPORT WAS NOT ACCEPTED BY THE TWGPGR </p><p>AND THE SECRETARIAT WAS REQUESTED TO REVISE IT IN LIGHT </p><p>OF COMMENTS RECEIVED DURING AND AFTER THE MEETING. </p><p>(C0MMENT:  THIS ISSUE WAS ALSO DISCUSSED AT THE RECENTLY </p><p>CONCLUDED CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES (COP) OF THE </p><p>CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY.  WASHINGTON READERS </p><p>WILL RECALL THAT MISLEADING DOCUMENTATION (POSTED BY THE </p><p>CBD SECRETARIAT, ACCORDING TO FAO) GAVE THE IMPRESSION </p><p>THAT THE TWGPGR HAD IN FACT COME TO SOME CONCLUSIONS ON </p><p>GURTS WHEN THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. FAO SECRETARIAT MEMBER </p><p>PEPE ESQUINAS (WHO WAS AT THE COP) COMMENTED TO MISOFF </p><p>THAT HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THE COP AT THE END RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT THE MATTER CAME UNDER THE FAO\'S MANDATE AND WAS </p><p>STILL OPEN.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>-- ANIMAL GENETIC RESOURCES: INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL TECHNICAL WORKING </p><p>GROUP ON THE GLOBAL STRATEGY, THE STATE OF THE WORLD\'S </p><p>ANIMAL GENETIC RESOURCES (SOWAGR).  AN AD-HOC SESSION OF </p><p>THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP MAY BE </p><p>CONVENED DURING THE COMMISSION SESSION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF THE PRESENCE OF DELEGATES WHO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. </p><p>THE COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO ACCEPT THE UPDATE ON SOWAGR </p><p>AND AUTHORIZE IT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>-- FAO PROGRAMS & ACTIVITIES ON GENETIC RESOURCES (FOR </p><p>INFORMATION) </p><p> </p><p>-- REPORTS FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS (FOR INFORMATION) </p><p> </p><p>-- CODE OF CONDUCT ON COLLECTING AND TRANSFERRING PLANT </p><p>GENETIC RESOURCES: THE FAO SECRETARIAT BELIEVES THAT THE </p><p>CODE  (WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED) COULD TAKE ON NEW </p><p>IMPORTANCE AS IT WOULD PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE EXCHANGE </p><p>OF MATERIALS NOT COVERED BY THE MULTILATERAL SYSTEM. </p><p>HOWEVER, IT WOULD NEED TO BE REVISED TO TAKE INTO </p><p>CONSIDERATION THE IT. </p><p> </p><p>-- CODE OF CONDUCT ON BIOTECHNOLOGY (COMMENT:  DORMANT </p><p>SINCE 1993 AND AN ITEM THAT THE U.S. HAS NOT SUPPORTED. </p><p>END COMMENT.) ON THIS ITEM, THE FAO SECRETARIAT EXPECTS </p><p>RESOURCES FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE </p><p>"BRAINSTORMING ON WHETHER IT SHOULD BE AND HOW ITSHOULD </p><p>BE" RATHER THAN ANY CONCLUSIONS AT THIS SSSION.   IN </p><p>DISCUSSING THE NEED FOR THE CODE, THEFAO SECRETARIAT </p><p>NOTED THAT COMMISSION MEMBERS WOLD HAVE TO DECIDE 1) IF </p><p>THERE WAS A RISK FROM BITECH BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE DRASTIC </p><p>CHANGE TO THE EVIRONMENT (I.E., PESTICIDE-RESISTANT </p><p>WEEDS DEVELPING AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE OF GENETIC </p><p>MATERIAL ITH BIOTECH PESTICIDE RESISTANT PLANTS); 2) </p><p>WHATMEASURES NEED TO BE TAKEN (ISOLATION,  QUARANTINE, </p><p>SPECIAL LABORATORY CONDITIONS AND, IF NECESSARY,3) </p><p>REGULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- AGREE TO NEW MATERIAL TRANFER AGREEMENTS (MTA) BE </p><p>USED BY THE INTERNATIONALAGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS </p><p>(IARCS) WHICH HOLDMATERIAL "IN TRUST."  THE FAO </p><p>SECRETARIAT REPORTED THAT A NEW MTA HAS BEEN PREPARED AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DISCUSSED, SUBSEQUENTLY "REFINED" BY THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PLANT GENETIC RESOURCE INSTITUTE (IPGRI) AND IS NOW WITH </p><p>THE FAO LEGAL SECTION.  MR. ESQUINAS CALLED THE NEW MTA </p><p>"EXCELLENT" AND NOTED THAT IT IS PRACTICALLY A </p><p>CONTINUATION OF THE ORIGINAL REGIME.  COMMENT: </p><p>ACCEPTANCE BY THE COMMISSION WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER </p><p>COUNTRIES SUCH AS COLOMBIA -- WHICH IS ACTIVELY SEEKING A </p><p>NEW REGIME, RATHER THAN A CONTINUATION OF THE OLD REGIME </p><p>--WILL BE HAPPY WITH THE NEW MTA.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>FUNDING QUESTIONS </p><p>---------------- </p><p>6. THE FAO SECRETARIAT IS STILL SEEKING FUNDING FOR </p><p>TRAVEL OF DEVELOPING COUNTRY MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN </p><p>THE COMMISSION SESSION.  THEY ALSO ARE CONCERNED THE FAO </p><p>REGULAR BUDGET FUNDING WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE </p><p>HEAVY WORK LOAD AHEAD FOR THE COMMISSION AND THE IGB. </p><p>THE FUTURE FINANCIAL NEEDS WILL BE SET OUT FOR MEMBERS AT </p><p>THE SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT </p><p>-------------- </p><p>THE IT NOW COUNTS 56 SIGNATORIES, AND 7 RATIFICATIONS. </p><p>AMONG THE SIGNATORIES ARE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND </p><p>AUSTRALIA.  CANADA RATIFIED SHORTLY BEFORE THE WORLD FOOD </p><p>SUMMIT:FIVE YEARS LATER.  (OTHER RATIFICATIONS ARE FROM </p><p>CAMBODIA, ERITREA, GUINEA, INDIA, JORDAN AND SUDAN). </p><p>FORTY RATIFICATIONS ARE REQUIRED BEFORE THE TREATY ENTERS </p><p>INTO FORCE.  THE UPCOMING IGB MAY REPRESENT THE MOMENT OF </p><p>MAXIMUM INFLUENCE THAT THE U.S. IS ABLE TO EXERT OVER THE </p><p>INTERIM GOVERNING BODY; OUR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY IN THE IGB WILL DIMINISH OVER TIME AS THE </p><p>TREATY DRAWS NEARER TO ENTERING INTO FORCE; FURTHERMORE, </p><p>THE U.S. STATEMENT AT THE TIME OF ADOPTION IN NOVEMBER </p><p>2001 WAS UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN THAT THE U.S. WOULD NOT, </p><p>UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, BE ABLE TO RATIFY UNTIL AFTER THE </p><p>TREATY HAD ENTERED INTO FORCE (SINCE OUR DOMESTIC LAW </p><p>WOULD REQUIRE A "NATIONAL SECURITY" CLAUSE INSERTED INTO </p><p>THE TREATY AND AMENDMENT TO THE TREATY COULD ONLY TAKE </p><p>PLACE AFTER THE TREATY CAME INTO EFFECT).
