<p>S E C R E T HARARE 000048 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ZI, CI </p><p>SUBJECT: CHINESE TIES TO ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 STATE 219948 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) The ruling ZANU-PF party has long maintained a close </p><p>diplomatic and military relationship with China, dating back </p><p>to the liberation war in the 1970\'s.  Since independence in </p><p>1980, the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) has purchased a range </p><p>of military hardware from China, including aircraft, </p><p>armaments, air defense radars, and medical equipment.  The </p><p>two countries frequently exchange senior-level visits by </p><p>military delegations, and China regularly sends technical </p><p>military advisors to work with their Zimbabwean counterparts. </p><p> Zimbabwe sends significant numbers of military officers to </p><p>Chinese training courses each year.  We understand that China </p><p>was considering the possibility of establishing a facility in </p><p>Harare to refurbish Chinese military equipment in the region, </p><p>but it is unclear whether these discussions have moved beyond </p><p>the exploratory stage.  China has also provided cellular </p><p>telephone intercept equipment to Zimbabwe\'s Central </p><p>Intelligence Organization, a move that will significantly </p><p>increase the ruling party\'s capacity to monitor those who </p><p>oppose it. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  China maintains one of the largest embassies in </p><p>Harare, with eighteen diplomats on the diplomatic list, </p><p>including seven officers in the economic/commercial section </p><p>alone.  In addition, three military officers serve in the </p><p>Defense Attache\'s office.  Two correspondents with China </p><p>Radio International -- a bureau chief and one other </p><p>journalist -- are assigned to Harare, along with one or two </p><p>correspondents with the Chinese news network. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The private Chinese community in Zimbabwe is, by </p><p>comparison, relatively small, comprising only several hundred </p><p>citizens who run restaurants, foreign exchange bureaus, and </p><p>small-scale import-export businesses.   Chinese DCM Zheng </p><p>Zhuqiang told us private trade between China and Zimbabwe is </p><p>fluorishing, and reported that China imports significantly </p><p>more from Zimbabwe than it exports (Note: about three times </p><p>more, according to GOZ trade statistics.  End Note.)  In </p><p>2002, approximately 30 percent of Zimbababwe\'s tobacco </p><p>exports went to China.  At the same time, Zheng lamented the </p><p>deteriorating macroeconomic environment in Zimbabwe and </p><p>predicted that the situation would only worsen.  The GOZ, he </p><p>said, was currently unable to repay large loans from Beijing. </p><p> Regarding government-supported investment, the picture was </p><p>not encouraging, either.  For instance, the GOZ\'s imposition </p><p>of price controls recently forced the closure of a profitable </p><p>joint venture cement production company formed only in 2000. </p><p> Zheng also implied that a Chinese parastatal construction </p><p>company -- which in the past has built major infrastructure </p><p>projects such as roads and dams -- is struggling.  In a </p><p>gesture of goodwill, the PRC recently donated 4,500 tons of </p><p>yellow maize directly to the Government of Zimbabwe and </p><p>provided some cash assistance to the GOZ for food purchases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The PRC is beginning to reach out to the opposition </p><p>MDC, in an apparent sign of growing realization that the </p><p>political and economic crises in Zimbabwe are unsustainable. </p><p> The Chinese Ambassador recently hosted several senior MDC </p><p>leaders for dinner.  According to one of the MDC attendees, </p><p>the Ambassador expressed serious concern about the </p><p>deterioriating political crisis in Zimbabwe and took his </p><p>guests by surprise with his outspoken criticism of Mugabe\'s </p><p>unwillingness to relinquish power.  He reportedly offered to </p><p>arrange a visit to China by a senior MDC delegation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
