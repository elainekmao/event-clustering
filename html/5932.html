<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000330 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NP, IN, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL/INDIA EXTRADITION TREATY NEGOTIATIONS FALTER </p><p>OVER TREATMENT OF THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Extradition treaty negotiations between the </p><p>Government of India (GOI) and the Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>ended inconclusively after five days on February 20.  This </p><p>initial meeting, held in Kathmandu at the working level, was </p><p>aimed at updating and revising the existing extradition </p><p>treaty between the two countries.  Simultaneous talks on </p><p>concluding a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty ended </p><p>on the same day.  The next round of talks on both treaties is </p><p>not expected before April or May. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Dr. Madan Kumar Bhattarai, Joint Secretary for South </p><p>Asia at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and leader of the GON </p><p>negotiating team, cited GOI insistence on a new provision for </p><p>the extradition of third country nationals as the most </p><p>significant point of contention between the two countries. </p><p>Committing explicitly to the extradition of third country </p><p>nationals is politically problematic for Nepal, Bhattarai </p><p>told the DCM.  The draft treaty the GON submitted for Indian </p><p>consideration is "silent" on the question, Bhattarai said. </p><p>By not specifically prohibiting the extradition of third </p><p>country nationals, the GON draft "by implication covers" it, </p><p>in his view.  The difference in the respective bilateral </p><p>perspectives on this matter is not insurmountable, he </p><p>believes, adding that he expects that a mutually acceptable </p><p>compromise can be reached in due time. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Executing a mutual legal assistance agreement will be </p><p>more difficult, Bhattarai asserted, because the areas of </p><p>disagreement are more numerous.  (Note:  Negotiations on the </p><p>proposed mutual legal assistance agreement were conducted by </p><p>Bhattarai\'s counterpart in the Home Ministry.  End note.) </p><p>For example, the Indians insisted on reciprocal visits by the </p><p>respective police forces to investigate crimes.  Under </p><p>current conditions, Bhattarai said, such visits are frequent </p><p>but take place informally.  Formal permission for Indian </p><p>authorities to conduct their own investigations on Nepal\'s </p><p>sovereign territory would be "politically sensitive," </p><p>Bhattarai said.  The GOI has also asked for the exchange of </p><p>judicial and criminal records, a request that the GON team </p><p>must first vet with Nepal\'s Supreme Court.  Although the two </p><p>countries are closer to agreeing (at least, in Bhattarai\'s </p><p>estimation) on a draft extradition treaty, the GON does not </p><p>wish to move ahead on one agreement without concomitant </p><p>progress on the other.  In short, the GON sees "no point in </p><p>hurrying" to conclude the treaties. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment:  In practice, both the GOI and GON often </p><p>quietly turn over each other\'s nationals without engaging in </p><p>formal extradition procedures.  The GOI has often accused the </p><p>GON of harboring Pakistani extremists on its territory and </p><p>has complained of GON inaction against alleged ISI activity </p><p>within its borders--both of which charges the GON publicly </p><p>denies.  The GON, whose foreign policy is predicated on </p><p>cultivating good relations with all countries in the region, </p><p>is unlikely to agree to language that it views as </p><p>specifically targeting one of those neighbors.  Formally </p><p>sanctioning Indian police activity on Nepali territory is, </p><p>moreover, certain to rankle national sovereignty sentiments, </p><p>ever sensitive to perceived interference from this giant </p><p>neighbor.  The GOI\'s insistence on both points is certain to </p><p>reinforce the GON view that there is indeed "no point in </p><p>hurrying," despite the benefits to both countries of the </p><p>bilateral agreements. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
