<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002549 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR CA/VO/L/A, WHA/CEN FOR TRIVELLI, WHA/CEN FOR LANG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: REVOCATION OF VISA (PENA, RICARDO  ANTONIO) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. NAME: PENA, RICARDO ANTONIO </p><p>B. DATE AND POB: 17 NOV 1962, HONDURAS </p><p>C. COUNTRY OF NATIONALITY AND RESIDENCE: HONDURAS </p><p>D. VISA ISSUANCE DATE: 15 NOV 1999 </p><p>   - VISA TYPE: B1/B2, MULTIPLE ENTRY </p><p>   - VISA EXPIRATION DATE: 14 NOV 2009 </p><p>E. PLACE OF ISSUANCE: TEGUCIGALPA </p><p>F. PASSPORT TYPE: DIPLOMATIC </p><p>   - PASSPORT NUMBER: 001239 </p><p>   - PASSPORT PLACE OF ISSUANCE: TEGUCIGALPA </p><p>G. SECTION OF INELIGIBILITY: 212(a)(2)(C)(i) </p><p> </p><p>H. Subject was arrested by Panamanian National Police on </p><p>September 9, 2002 while attempting to cross the Panama/Costa </p><p>Rica border.  He was arrested in the town of Paso Canoas, </p><p>Panama with 3 to 4 kilograms of heroin concealed in several </p><p>pairs of shoes that were in his suitcase.  Subject attempted </p><p>to avoid a search by presenting his Honduran diplomatic </p><p>passport and claiming diplomatic immunity.  A check of </p><p>records in Honduras indicates that Subject is no longer a </p><p>member of the Honduran Congress.  He is therefore no longer </p><p>entitled to use his diplomatic passport. </p><p> </p><p>I. TRAVEL WOULD LIKELY BE THROUGH THE POE MIAMI OR HOUSTON. </p><p> </p><p>J. SUBJECT ENTERED INTO CLASS 10 SEP 2002 UNDER 2(C)(i). </p><p> </p><p>K. Subject is being contacted by letter and informed of his </p><p>ineligibility.  He is not likely to present his visa for </p><p>physical cancellation. </p><p>L. Local carriers have been notified and INS Tegucigalpa has </p><p>been advised and has passed this information through INS </p><p>channels. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  Subject as a former member of the Honduran </p><p>congress, was supposed to have submitted his diplomatic </p><p>passport to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for cancellation </p><p>once he was no longer a member of congress.  His use of the </p><p>diplomatic passport to attempt to evade inspection at a port </p><p>of entry serves to highlight the widespread use of Honduran </p><p>diplomatic passports by persons not entitled to have them. </p><p>Conservative estimates, by the GOH indicates that there are </p><p>approximately 50,000 diplomatic passports in circulation in </p><p>this nation of only six and one half million persons.  The </p><p>lack of control by GOH authorities over the issuance and </p><p>recovery of these passports exacerbates the problem by </p><p>making it relatively easy to obtain and use a diplomatic </p><p>passport here.  We believe if Panamanian authorities return </p><p>subject\'s passport to him, he will likely attempt to travel </p><p>on that same diplomatic passport to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
