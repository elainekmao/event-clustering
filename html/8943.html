<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002853 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, EB/IFB/OMA </p><p>PARIS ALSO FOR USOECD </p><p>TREAS FOR OASIA HARLOW, CARNES </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR WALLAR </p><p>USDOC 6800/ITA/TD/OTEA/TISD/HSCHULTZ AND </p><p>4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN EXPORTERS FACE DIFFICULTY WITH STRONGER </p><p>EURO, BUT LONG-TERM EFFECTS MAY BE LIMITED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Italian exports, traditionally vulnerable </p><p>to exchange rate fluctuations, are being hit by the </p><p>Euro\'s appreciation versus the dollar. Exports to Italy\'s </p><p>third most important market, the United States, are down </p><p>eight percent on a 12-month year to year basis.  In </p><p>addition to the Euro\'s appreciation versus the dollar, </p><p>two other factors cast a pall over Italian exporters: </p><p>Germany, Italy\'s largest export market, is in serious </p><p>economic trouble, and SARS has suppressed consumer demand </p><p>in Asia. One positive aspect of a depreciated dollar: the </p><p>price of raw materials and oil, generally dollar- </p><p>denominated, should fall, indirectly affecting the price </p><p>of exports of manufactured goods.   Experts predict that </p><p>long-term effects on Italian exports may be limited, as </p><p>long as the Euro remains stable with regard to other </p><p>major currencies and the dollar does not drop much </p><p>further. End-summary </p><p> </p><p>The Euro\'s Value </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Euro reached its highest level ever against </p><p>the U.S. dollar on May 27, with a rate of USD 1.1935/ </p><p>Euro. Overall, the Euro is up against the dollar by more </p><p>than 13 percent for the year and 30 percent over one year </p><p>ago.  The Euro has strengthened, to a lesser extent, </p><p>against the British pound (11 percent through end-May </p><p>2003 and 14 percent over one year ago), and the Japanese </p><p>yen (11 percent through end-May 2003 and 20 percent over </p><p>one year ago). </p><p> </p><p>Effect on Italian Exports </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Italy has an export-led economy, with the United </p><p>States representing the third largest foreign market for </p><p>Italian exports. Italian exports have traditionally been </p><p>highly susceptible to exchange rate fluctuations. Some </p><p>leading Italian economists, including Central Bank </p><p>Governor Antonio Fazio and Enrico Giovannini, an </p><p>economist at the OECD, argue that Italy\'s exporters are </p><p>even more susceptible than their European counterparts to </p><p>currency fluctuations.  In his annual report on May 31, </p><p>Fazio argued that the composition of Italian exports </p><p>makes them highly vulnerable to import price trends. </p><p>Italian exports, he pointed out, are specialized in </p><p>furniture, leather products and non-mineral metals </p><p>manufacturing. Consumer demand for such high-end consumer </p><p>products, he contended, is particularly influenced by the </p><p>import price. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Foreign trade with non-EU countries accounts for </p><p>47 percent of Italy\'s total foreign trade. Clothing </p><p>exports to non-EU markets represent 53.6 percent of total </p><p>exports of clothing, of which 15.1 percent go to the U.S. </p><p>Separately, footwear exports to non-EU countries account </p><p>for 42.2 percent of overall exports of footwear, of which </p><p>18.5 percent go to the U.S.  Of textile manufacturing </p><p>machinery, 69.9 percent of total exports of this category </p><p>go to non-EU countries, 12 percent of which are to the </p><p>American market.  The U.S. also is the primary export </p><p>market for the furniture sector. </p><p> </p><p>Latest Data </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On May 22, a leading economic think tank, Istat, </p><p>released data through April of Italy\'s foreign trade with </p><p>non-EU countries.  The data showed an E956 million </p><p>deficit in the first four months of the year. Exports </p><p>grew only 0.2 percent from April 2002 to April 2003, </p><p>while imports grew 2.6 percent. The strengthening of the </p><p>Euro had an immediate impact on Italy\'s exports to the </p><p>U.S., which decreased 8.8 percent from April 2002 to </p><p>April 2003. </p><p>In contrast, Italian exports to China grew by 23.2 </p><p>percent from April 2002 to April 2003 and by 26.1 percent </p><p>from the period January-April 2002 to the same period </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>this year.  SARS, however, may show suppressed consumer </p><p>demand in Asia in later statistics. </p><p> </p><p>Some good may come </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) According to Antonio Sagnotti, a researcher at </p><p>one of Italy\'s leading banks, Banca Nazionale di Lavoro, </p><p>Italian exports to the United States will continue to </p><p>fall as a result of the strengthened Euro, but also as a </p><p>result of weak American consumer demands overall. </p><p>Sagnotti is optimistic, however, that the medium-range </p><p>effect of a strengthened Euro will be limited.  In </p><p>contrast to the Central Bank Governor, he does not </p><p>believe Italian exports are particularly vulnerable to </p><p>exchange rate fluctuations. He argued that the demand for </p><p>Italian exports would not shrink significantly as long as </p><p>the Euro/Dollar exchange rate does not exceed .80 </p><p>Eurocents/one dollar.  Demand for high-end consumer </p><p>goods, of which many Italian exports are, remains stable </p><p>as long as there is only a 10-20 percent fluctuation in </p><p>exchange rate values, he contended.  Sagnotti expects </p><p>only a modest decline in Italian exports to the U.S. this </p><p>year, predicting that a recovery of U.S. domestic demand </p><p>in the second half of the year will offset some of the </p><p>price increases caused by the Euro\'s appreciation. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Some leading economists see an upside to a </p><p>stronger Euro vis--vis the dollar.  Minister of European </p><p>Union Affairs, Rocco Buttiglione, recently commented that </p><p>a strengthened Euro provides an opportunity for Italian </p><p>companies to buy U.S. companies at a cheaper price.  He </p><p>argued that Italian companies need to expand beyond the </p><p>domestic market to enhance their overall competitiveness. </p><p>Buttiglione also observed that Italian exporters would </p><p>benefit from the lower price, in Euro terms, of raw </p><p>materials.  Arrigo Sadun, Director General of the </p><p>macroeconomic department of the Ministry of Economy and </p><p>Finance, expects the overall effect of a stronger Euro </p><p>will be positive.  Sadun told us that the possible loss </p><p>in export earnings and market share would be offset by </p><p>the positive impact by the lower price of oil imports and </p><p>raw materials. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) According to Stefano Siviero of the research </p><p>department of the Bank of Italy, the Central Bank </p><p>predicts that a stronger Euro versus the dollar will </p><p>reduce export growth only by an estimated 0.1 percent </p><p>over the period 2003-2005. </p><p> </p><p>The impact on GDP growth </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) A stronger Euro also is expected to affect GDP </p><p>growth negatively by approximately 0.3 percent in the </p><p>same period.  An anticipated increase in imports accounts </p><p>for most of the negative impact on GDP growth.  If the </p><p>Euro were to appreciate significantly more versus other </p><p>major currencies besides the dollar, the impact would be </p><p>larger.  According to leading economists, if the Euro </p><p>were to strengthen by another 10 percent or more vis-- </p><p>vis the Yen, the British Pound and others, export growth </p><p>could decline by 2.7 percent in the period 2003-2005 and </p><p>GDP growth by 1.3 percent, in the same period. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) On June 10, Istat released final GDP growth data, </p><p>which showed a 0.1 percent decrease from the fourth </p><p>quarter 2002 to the first quarter 2003, but a 0.8 percent </p><p>increase from the first quarter 2002.  According to ISAE, </p><p>Italian consumer confidence is the lowest in 9 years. </p><p>Inflation fell from April to May, from 2.7 percent to 2.6 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The consensus forecast continues to estimate a </p><p>GDP growth rate of one percent for 2003.  However, a </p><p>contact at the Central Bank mentioned to us that a recent </p><p>Bank of Italy confidential report predicted a GDP growth </p><p>rate of just 0.4 percent, the same as in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Other concerns </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) The Euro\'s appreciation versus the dollar is just </p><p>one factor constraining Italian exporters.  Another </p><p>important factor is the weakness of the German economy. </p><p>Germany is Italy\'s largest trading partner, accounting </p><p>for almost 20 percent of total Italian exports. An </p><p>additional factor is the impact of SARS on consumer </p><p>demand in Asia during the second and likely third quarter </p><p>of this year.  China, Japan and other Asian countries </p><p>account for almost 7 percent of Italian exports.  The </p><p>combination of these factors is likely to reverberate </p><p>negatively on Italian exports and on Italian GDP growth </p><p>this year. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>13. (U) Exports account for about 25 percent of GDP and </p><p>are one of the pillars of Italian economic growth. While </p><p>exports have traditionally been vulnerable to exchange </p><p>rate fluctuations, Italian exporters also are losing a </p><p>competitive edge, many economists worry. Italy invests </p><p>only .75 of its GDP percent in R&D, compared to an </p><p>average of 1.75 percent of the EU.  This lack of </p><p>investment in technology, according to economists, has </p><p>reduced the competitiveness of Italy exports and </p><p>aggravated their sensitivity to exchange rate </p><p>fluctuations.
