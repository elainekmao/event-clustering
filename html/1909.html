<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002118 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/2011 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, CJAN, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED ON COUNTER-NARCOTICS </p><p>CERTIFICATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 122773 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2074 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 1547 </p><p>     D. STATE 118125 </p><p>     E. ABUJA 2113 </p><p>     F. ABUJA 2115 </p><p>     G. ABUJA 2116 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action message.  Please see para 7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by PolMilOff, called on </p><p>NSA Aliyu Mohammed on August 22.  LTC Idris, the NSA\'s </p><p>Military Advisor also attended.  This message summarizes </p><p>their discussion on Nigeria\'s counter-narcotics performance </p><p>and USG benchmarks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador Jeter emphasized that there existed a </p><p>perception that Nigeria was off-track on meeting </p><p>counter-narcotics benchmarks, and passed the NSA the </p><p>non-paper relayed in Ref A.  The Ambassador explained that </p><p>the certification process was an annual event, and that </p><p>Nigeria would have to do more to meet the requirements for </p><p>certification next year.  Drugs had been discovered on the </p><p>Nigeria Airways/South Africa Airways flight to New York, the </p><p>NDLEA-DEA joint taskforce was moribund, and while the </p><p>President had agreed to double the NDLEA budget, the Embassy </p><p>had seen no evidence that NDLEA had received more money or </p><p>had additional resources.  Moreover, Nigeria had not even </p><p>bothered to answer the FATF survey, and had therefore joined </p><p>an ignominious group of "non-cooperating" countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The NSA said he understood, and that the GON would </p><p>take the benchmarks very seriously.  He said he would meet </p><p>with Alhaji Bello Lafiaji, the NDLEA Chairman, to discuss the </p><p>way forward.  He also noted that the NDLEA had been given </p><p>access to Nigeria\'s ports two weeks ago, which should help </p><p>close another route for traffickers.  Finally, the NSA asked </p><p>if Nigeria\'s submission of the FATF questionnaire could </p><p>reverse the damage that had been done.  He said that he would </p><p>make sure the survey was completed and submitted if this </p><p>would have any impact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The NSA then asked about the case of the funds </p><p>allegedly looted by Abacha.  He noted that the forensic </p><p>analysis was expected back in Abuja within the next few days. </p><p> The NSA asked if he should send the analysis to Ambassador </p><p>Jeter or a letter from President Obasanjo to President Bush. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter suggested that the NSA keep working in the </p><p>channel President Obasanjo had used, and the Embassy would </p><p>make sure the forensic documents were sent to Washington. </p><p>The Ambassador emphasized that the Embassy wants to work with </p><p>the GON on this issue, and he encouraged greater interaction </p><p>between the GON expert on this issue and the Embassy\'s Legatt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: The seriousness with which the NSA took the </p><p>Ambassador\'s warning on certification was welcome; however, </p><p>it has been consistently difficult to get the GON to engage </p><p>more than rhetorically on these issues, particularly serious </p><p>engagement with the Attorney General.  While the NDLEA has </p><p>made serious efforts to combat trafficking, resources are </p><p>limited, and other agencies such as the Ministry of Justice, </p><p>have thus far taken little action.  Embassy will continue to </p><p>engage the GON at every opportunity to encourage progress on </p><p>the benchmarks.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ACTION REQUEST: The NSA asked if completion of the </p><p>questionnaire, even at this late date, would have any impact </p><p>on Nigeria\'s standing.  Embassy requests information to </p><p>respond to this question, and if the answer is yes, to whom </p><p>should the GON forward the FATF responses.  END ACTION </p><p>REQUEST. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
