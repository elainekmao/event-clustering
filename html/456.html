<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KHARTOUM 02104 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.0.12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINS, PHUM, PINR, ECON, EFIN, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  BASHIR AND THE RCC ON THE EVE OF THEIR SECOND </p><p>          ANNIVERSARY </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  BESEIGED AND CRITICIZED FROM VIRTUALLY </p><p>EVERY QUARTER, AS IT APPROACHES ITS SECOND ANNIVERSARY, </p><p>GENERAL OMAR AL-BASHIR\'S REVOLUTION COMMAND COUNCIL </p><p>NONETHELESS APPEARS FIRMLY IN CHARGE OF SUDAN.  THE </p><p>RECENT CURRENCY CHANGE, ABOUT AS BADLY BOTCHED AS </p><p>ANYTHING THE GOS HAS DONE, REVEALED A POPULATION </p><p>TOTALLY COWED.  THE OPPOSITION REMAINS FRAGMENTED AND </p><p>UNORGANIZED AND MOST POTENTIAL LEADERSHIP IS OUTSIDE </p><p>TRY.  CONFLICT CONTINUES WITHIN THE RCC WITH </p><p>SOME MEMBERS MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN OTHERS, BUT BASHIR </p><p>HIMSELF IS PROBABLY STILL FIRST AMONG EQUALS.  THE </p><p>NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT EFFECTIVELY CONTROLS INTERNAL </p><p>SECURITY, THE ECONOMY, AND THE MEDIA, HENCE </p><p>CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL POWER, BUT NIF HEAD HASSAN AL </p><p>TURABI AND BASHIR SHARE A COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS </p><p>GIVING THE IMPRESSION OF PERVASIVE NIF INFLUENCE WHICH </p><p>MAY NOT BE AS ABSOLUTE AS IT APPEARS.  UNLESS AND UNTIL </p><p>THOSE INTERESTS DIVERGE IT WILL REMAIN DIFFICULT TO </p><p>ASCERTAIN WHO WIELDS GREATER POWER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DESPITE INCREASING CRITICISM FROM EVERY QUARTER </p><p>EXCEPT THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT, GENERAL OMAR AL </p><p>BASHIR\'S GOVERNMENT APPEARS STRONGER THEN EVER.  IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF THE GULF WAR AND WITH A TOTALLY BANKRUPT </p><p>ECONOMY, THE RCC SHOULD BE ON THE DEFENSIVE, BUT IT IS </p><p>NOT.  ANY DOUBTS ABOUT THE REGIME\'S RESILIENCE, HAVE </p><p>BEEN DISPELLED BY THE RECENT CURRENCY CHANGE.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>BADLY EXECUTED, THE GOS ACCOMPLISHED, AT LEAST FOR THE </p><p>MOMENT, ITS STATED GOALS OF REDUCING LIQUIDITY, GAINING </p><p>SOME CONTROL OVER THE MONEY SUPPLY, AND REDUCING </p><p>INFLATION.  UNSTATED BUT OBVIOUS GOALS SUCH AS </p><p>UNDERMINING THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE MAJOR </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTIES AND THE SPLA WERE ALSO SERVED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AT THE SAME TIME, DUE TO A SERIES OF ERRORS AND </p><p>MISCALCULATIONS, THE CURRENCY CHANGE BROUGHT THE </p><p>ECONOMY TO A SCREECHING HALT AND ADVERSELY IMPACTED </p><p>VIRTUALLY EVERY SUDANESE.  HOWEVER, AGAIN SHOWING THEIR </p><p>TENDENCY TO SHRINK TO ANY OCCASION, THE SUDANESE LINED </p><p>UP DAY AFTER DAY AT BANKS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO TURN IN </p><p>THEIR CASH FOR PARTIAL PAYMENT AND PROMISES.  QUEUES </p><p>WERE GENERALLY DISCIPLINED AND WITHOUT INCIDENT; IN </p><p>SEVERAL CASES SOLDIERS ACTUALLY MARCHED THE CIVILIAN </p><p>POPULATION IN MILITARY LIKE FORMATION TO THE BANKS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT, WHILE WIDESPREAD AND </p><p>INCREASINGLY VOCAL, REMAINS FRAGMENTED AND TOTALLY </p><p>UNORGANIZED.  ALMOST ALL POTENTIAL LEADERSHIP IS </p><p>OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  THE FEW FORMER POLITICAL PARTY </p><p>LEADERS STILL IN KHARTOUM ARE SO DISCREDITED THEY POSE </p><p>LITTLE THREAT TO THE GOVERNMENT.  TRADITIONAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS OF REGIME MAINTENANCE SUCH AS THE </p><p>MILITARY, POLICE, AND BUREAUCRACY ARE UNDOUBTEDLY </p><p>DISENCHANTED WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BUT THEY ARE SO </p><p>THOROUGHLY INFILTRATED WITH LOYAL SECURITY PERSONNEL </p><p>AND NIF INFORMANTS THAT THERE IS LITTLE POSSIBILITY </p><p>THEY COULD MOUNT ANY EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ONLY THE NIF SUPPORTS THE REGIME AND THEY HAVE </p><p>PROFITED HANDSOMELY FROM THEIR COLLUSION.  AS NIF </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE QUICK TO POINT OUT, THEY WERE THE ONLY </p><p>PARTY IN OPPOSITION WHEN BASHIR TOOK OVER IN JUNE </p><p>1989.  CONSEQUENTLY THEY WERE THE LOGICAL CHOICE TO </p><p>ASSIST THE NEW GOVERNMENT.  (FYI:  SEVERAL SUDANESE </p><p>STILL CLAIM, WITHOUT EVIDENT PROOF, THAT THE COUP WAS </p><p>ENGINEERED BY THE NIF TO THWART SADIQ AL MAHDI\'S PEACE </p><p>EFFORTS.  END FYI.) NIF MEMBERS OR SYMPATHIZERS NOW </p><p>OCCUPY KEY POSITIONS IN THE BUREAUCRACY, MEDIA, LABOR, </p><p>ACADEMIA, JUDICIARY, MILITARY, AND SECURITY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  BASHIR\'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED ALMOST </p><p>EVERY MAJOR NIP POLICY FROM FEDERALISM, AND </p><p>ISLAMICIZATION OF EDUCATION TO THE RECENT ADOPTION OF </p><p>OF A NEW PENAL CODE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM TURABI\'S 1988 </p><p>PROPOSAL AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA.  LONG A POWERFUL </p><p>FORCE IN BANKING AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THEY NOW </p><p>CONTROL WHATEVER PROFITABLE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TAKES </p><p>PLACE IN SUDAN.  NIF MEMBERS WERE VIRTUALLY UNAFFECTED </p><p>BY THE CURRENCY CHANGE; HAVING BEEN FOREWARNED, THEY </p><p>TURNED THEIR CASH INTO GOLD, COMMODITIES, OR HARD </p><p>CURRENCY PRIOR TO THE CHANGE.  THE NIP, HOWEVER, IS NOT </p><p>A MONOLITH AND SOME MEMBERS EXERCISE GREATER INFLUENCE </p><p>THAN OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ONLY LIBYA JARS THE RCC-NIP EQUILIBRIUM.  QADHAFI </p><p>HAS CRITICIZED BASHIR FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA </p><p>AND THE MIXING OF RELIGION AND POLITCS, TWO KEY NIF </p><p>POLICIES.  LIBYA HAS ALSO MOVED DECISIVELY AGAINST </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS AT HOME, AND LIBYAN RECONCILIATION WITH </p><p>EGYPT, OFTEN CITED B/ NIF MEMBERS AS THEIR ARCHENEMY, </p><p>MITIGATE AGAINST NIP INFLUENCE.  MOST BELIEVE ONLY </p><p>LIBYAN INFLUENCE KEEPS BASHIR FROM DECLARING SUDAN AN </p><p>ISLAMIC REPUBLIC.  THE NIF SEEMS TO BE BANKING ON </p><p>SUDAN\'S EMERGING RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN TO COUNTER </p><p>LIBYAN INFLUENCE, WHICH IS BASED PRIMARILY ON GOS </p><p>DEPENDENCE FOR BOTH OIL AND ARMS.  ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>IRANIANS ARE ASSERTING THEMSELVES IN CULTURAL, </p><p>EDUCATIONAL, AND RELIGIOUS AREAS (ALL EXCLUSIVELY NIF </p><p>SPHERES), THEY HAVE YET TO COMPETE WITH THE LIBYANS IN </p><p>SUPPLYING OIL OR ARMS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  CONFLICT CONTINUES WITHIN THE RCC BETWEEN </p><p>THOSE MEMBERS WHO STRONGLY FAVOR NIP POLICIES AND THOSE </p><p>WHO PREFER A MORE SECULAR STATE.  TWO RCC MEMBERS WERE </p><p>RECENTLY DISMISSED (OR RESIGNED DEPENDING ON WHOM YOU </p><p>CONSULT) FOR THEIR DISSENTING OPINIONS.  THE THREE </p><p>SOUTHERNERS AND OTHER MODERATES APPEAR TO HAVE LITTLE </p><p>IF ANY INFLUENCE, LEADING MOST OBSERVERS TO CONCLUDE </p><p>THAT TURABI AND THE NIF, OPERATING IN A POLITICAL </p><p>VACUUM, CONTROL THE GOVERNMENT COMPLETELY.  NIF </p><p>INFLUENCE IS CERTAINLY GREAT, BUT BASHIR SEEMS STILL IN </p><p>CONTROL.  BECAUSE HE IS A PROPONENT OF NIF POLICIES, IT </p><p>IS UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT HE IS HIS OWN MAN, AS TINY </p><p>ROWLAND SUGGESTS.  UNTIL HE AND TURABI COME INTO </p><p>CONFLICT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH </p><p>POWER TURABI ACTUALLY WIELDS.  HOWEVER, AS LONG AS </p><p>BASHIR AND TURABI AGREE ON THE AGENDA FOR THE GOS, </p><p>CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM OVER A MAJOR SUBSTANTIVE, POLICY </p><p>ISSUE IS UNLIKELY. </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
