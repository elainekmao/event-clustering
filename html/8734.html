<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 003515 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/NGA AND PRM, GENEVA FOR RMA, OCPA FOR JONES </p><p>AND LAPENN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: REPATRIATION OF IRAQIS:  VIEWS FROM JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 145785 </p><p>     B. POLASCHIK/LAPENN JUNE 8 E-MAIL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  According to the GOJ, between 22,000 and </p><p>23,000 Iraqis have returned voluntarily from Jordan since </p><p>hostilities began.  Neither UNHCR nor the GOJ is pushing for </p><p>the quick return of the 250,000 to 300,000 Iraqis resident in </p><p>Jordan; both want to wait until security conditions improve </p><p>in Iraq before organizing assisted returns.  At the same </p><p>time, however, the GOJ has waived all overstay fines for </p><p>illegal Iraqis returning to Iraq -- provided they agree not </p><p>to return to Jordan for five years.  In spite of the ongoing </p><p>spontaneous returns, not one single Iraqi has approached </p><p>UNHCR to register for an assisted return; UNHCR believes </p><p>continuing security problems in Iraq and UNHCR\'s lack of </p><p>publicity regarding return options are responsible.  UNHCR </p><p>does not want to engage in return discussions with the GOJ or </p><p>implementing partners until security conditions in Iraq </p><p>improve and UNHCR/Iraq is able to receive returnees.  UNHCR </p><p>anticipates that small-scale spontaneous returns will </p><p>continue over the next two to three months, with </p><p>UNHCR-assisted returns beginning in September at the </p><p>earliest.  UNHCR is planning for the return of 70,000 Iraqis </p><p>from Jordan over the next six months.  Separately, Jordan </p><p>will continue to serve as a transit point for Iraqis </p><p>returning from Europe; IOM will resume its Assisted Voluntary </p><p>Return program June 12-13 with a group of 12 Iraqis.  IOM </p><p>believes that up to 100,000 Iraqis could return from Europe </p><p>over the next year.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>UP TO 23,000 SPONTANEOUS RETURNS FROM JORDAN </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  According to Minister of State for Foreign Affairs </p><p>Shaher Bak, between 22,000 and 23,000 Iraqis have returned </p><p>from Jordan since hostilities began in March.  Bak noted that </p><p>the initial 5,000 to 7,000 returnees in the early days of </p><p>hostilities were in "another category," security-related </p><p>deportations and presumed fighters.  (NOTE:  The GOJ is </p><p>sharing a much lower figure -- 7,200 returnees -- with UNHCR </p><p>and IOM.)  Both Bak and UNHCR Representative Sten Bronee </p><p>commented separately that a large number of Iraqis may now be </p><p>traveling between Iraq and Jordan in search of business </p><p>opportunities or scouting out conditions for the return of </p><p>other family members.  (NOTE:  UNHCR has sought coalition </p><p>forces\' assistance in monitoring returns from Jordan to Iraq, </p><p>preparing a draft survey for use by coalition forces at the </p><p>Karameh/Trebil border post.  Embassy Amman\'s HACC is working </p><p>to develop appropriate monitoring procedures.) </p><p> </p><p>NO GOJ PRESSURE AND NO IRAQI INTEREST IN UNHCR HELP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Neither the GOJ nor UNHCR is pressing for the quick </p><p>return of the estimated 250,000 to 300,000 Iraqis currently </p><p>resident in Jordan.  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs </p><p>Shaher Bak has repeatedly told UNHCR that the GOJ wants to </p><p>wait until conditions improve in Iraq before organizing </p><p>assisted returns.  Bak repeated this message in a June 12 </p><p>meeting with DCM and refcoord, pledging explicitly that the </p><p>GOJ "would not force Iraqis out."  Once security conditions </p><p>and stability in Iraq has improved, Bak continued, the GOJ </p><p>would work with international organizations to organize </p><p>assisted returns.  Until then, the GOJ is beginning </p><p>preparations, working with the Ministries of Interior and </p><p>Labor to identify all Iraqis resident in Jordan as well as </p><p>their particular legal status.  Bak predicted that many, but </p><p>not all Iraqis currently resident in Jordan would wish to </p><p>return to Iraq.  In order to encourage the return of Iraqis </p><p>ready and willing to leave Jordan, the GOJ reportedly has </p><p>agreed to waive all fines resulting from illegal overstays -- </p><p>provided the Iraqis do not return to Jordan for five years. </p><p>However, Bak told emboffs the GOJ would not publicize this </p><p>policy until it was ready to implement large-scale, organized </p><p>returns.  Given the GOJ\'s relaxed attitude about the largely </p><p>illegal Iraqi population, UNHCR staff and other observers are </p><p>beginning to speculate that the GOJ might, in fact, want </p><p>illegal Iraqi laborers to remain in Jordan and continue to </p><p>play their key role in the grey economy. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) In spite of the ongoing spontaneous returns, UNHCR </p><p>reports that not one single Iraqi has approached UNHCR to </p><p>register for repatriation.  Bronee believes that Iraqis in </p><p>Jordan will remain uninterested in organized, voluntary </p><p>repatriation programs as long as security remains problematic </p><p>inside Iraq.  He noted that word already is circulating in </p><p>the refugee community of a May 30 incident in which a busload </p><p>of 30 Palestinian refugees, returning to Baghdad from UNHCR\'s </p><p>refugee camp at Ruweished, was robbed of all money and </p><p>luggage near Ramadi, Iraq.  Similarly, in meetings with </p><p>UNHCR\'s existing Iraqi caseload, more than 500 Iraqi refugees </p><p>told UNHCR they were not willing to return to Iraq and would </p><p>insist upon resettlement in a third country. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Bronee speculated that some of the Iraqi disinterest </p><p>in voluntary repatriation could be due to the fact that UNHCR </p><p>has not yet undertaken a concerted publicity campaign in </p><p>Jordan; perhaps, he wondered, Iraqis simply are not aware of </p><p>their options?  But given continuing security difficulties </p><p>inside Iraq and the GOJ\'s willingness to allow Iraqis to </p><p>remain in Jordan, Bronee continued, he is unwilling to begin </p><p>the repatriation process prematurely, by advertising programs </p><p>and possibilities before conditions are appropriate. </p><p> </p><p>NO ORGANIZED RETURNS BEFORE SEPTEMBER </p><p>AND NO DISCUSSIONS TIL CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Bronee expects small-scale spontaneous returns to </p><p>continue over the next two to three months, with </p><p>UNHCR-organized returns beginning in September at the </p><p>earliest.  UNHCR/Iraq Representative Daniel Bellamy told </p><p>Bronee that UNHCR/Iraq staff would be unable to receive </p><p>assisted returns before September at the earliest.  Yet UNHCR </p><p>continues to use 70,000 returns from Jordan over the next six </p><p>months as its planning figure, a calculation Bronee admits is </p><p>purely a guess. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) UNHCR asked the GOJ in an April 14 diplomatic note </p><p>for "closer discussions" on organized return programs, but </p><p>has not yet gotten a response.  Bronee said he is reluctant </p><p>to push the GOJ for a dialogue at this point, as the status </p><p>quo -- GOJ willingness to allow Iraqis to remain in Jordan -- </p><p>will remain necessary until security conditions in Iraq </p><p>improve and UNHCR/Iraq is ready to receive returnees.  Bronee </p><p>and IOM Representative Georgette Hoshe have had preliminary </p><p>discussions regarding possible cooperation on return </p><p>programs, but subsequently agreed that their respective </p><p>headquarters must agree on a division of labor throughout the </p><p>region.  UNHCR has had limited discussions with NGOs </p><p>International Relief and Development (IRD) and Caritas/Jordan </p><p>regarding possible return programs but has not even begun the </p><p>process of identifying implementing partners.  (Both IRD and </p><p>Caritas plan to seek PRM funding.) </p><p> </p><p>IOM:  JORDAN AS TRANSIT POINT FOR RETURNEES FROM EUROPE; </p><p>100,000 POSSIBLE OVER NEXT 12 MONTHS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Separately, it is likely that Jordan will continue to </p><p>serve as a key transit point for Iraqis returning from third </p><p>countries, at least until Baghdad International Airport </p><p>reopens for commercial flights -- and possibly longer. </p><p>Before the war, IOM used Royal Jordanian flights to transport </p><p>Iraqis from Europe to Jordan and then onto Iraq, making </p><p>Jordan\'s role in the return process into little more than a </p><p>transit stop.  However, with no commercial flights into </p><p>Baghdad, IOM now plans to fly Iraqi returnees to Amman and </p><p>then send them overland to Baghdad.  IOM Representative </p><p>Georgette Hoshe reports that IOM has excellent cooperation </p><p>with the GOJ on its Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) program </p><p>for Iraqis, with the GOJ providing transit visas and police </p><p>escort. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Hoshe informed refcoord on June 8 that IOM would </p><p>resume its AVR program on June 12 and 13, facilitating the </p><p>return of 12 Iraqi nationals from Europe (ref b).  Under the </p><p>program, IOM provides Iraqi nationals transportation from </p><p>Amman to Baghdad, plus a reintegration grant of USD 3500 per </p><p>person.  For this initial group, IOM will distribute the </p><p>reintegration grant in Amman; future returnees will receive </p><p>their grants in Baghdad.  Hoshe predicted that the return of </p><p>Iraqis from Europe and other third countries would continue </p><p>on a small scale over the next two to three months, as Iraqis </p><p>test their luck and scout out opportunities for family </p><p>members remaining abroad.  She noted that all returnees in </p><p>this initial group were single men.  Hoshe believes increased </p><p>numbers of Iraqi returns will not happen before November and </p><p>is planning on running an AVR program in Jordan through June </p><p>2004.  She predicted that the number of Iraqis returning from </p><p>Europe could reach 100,000. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) CPA Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
