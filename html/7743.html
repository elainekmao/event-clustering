The situation in northern Iraq areas remains semi-stable.  There </p><p>is almost no movement of IDPs, and UNOPS believes there is no IDP </p><p>emergency in the North.  UNOPS is considering returning to pre- </p><p>war activities once the status of the U.N. in Iraq is clarified. </p><p>ICRC also reported that the need for emergency humanitarian </p><p>assistance no longer exists in the North, but plans to continue </p><p>assessments in the Kirkuk and Mosul areas. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Due to increased supplies and a reduction in pre-war shortage </p><p>concerns, the market cost of a sack of wheat flour is now 75 </p><p>Iraqi dinars.  This is 20 dinars less (approximately USD 3.50) </p><p>than it was six to eight weeks ago.  WFP delivered 550 metric </p><p>tons (MT) of food to a warehouse in Mosul on 25 April.  Eighty- </p><p>three trucks departed WFP locations in Syria for the northern </p><p>Iraq region on 26 April.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART met with the United Nations Office for Project </p><p>Services (UNOPS) Internally Displaced Persons Unit on 26 April to </p><p>discuss current operations regarding internally displaced persons </p><p>(IDPs) in northern Iraq.  In anticipation of a possible IDP </p><p>emergency resulting from military action, UNOPS mapped the </p><p>locations of public buildings in the three governorates that </p><p>could be used to temporarily house IDPs.  At the start of </p><p>hostilities, UNOPS established seven camps and four reception </p><p>centers throughout the region.  UNOPS\'s assistance to the new </p><p>caseload (those who came as a direct result of impending military </p><p>action) included distribution of kerosene, fuel for local </p><p>authorities\' water trucks, and training for local authorities on </p><p>SPHERE standards. </p><p> </p><p>4.  UNOPS stressed the excellent coordination between themselves </p><p>and other international and non-governmental organizations (IOs </p><p>and NGOs), such as the International Committee of the Red Cross </p><p>(ICRC), the United Nations Children\'s Fund (UNICEF), Save the </p><p>Children-UK, and the Iraqi Red Crescent Society.  UNOPS estimated </p><p>that, at its peak, approximately 9,000 IDPs were housed in public </p><p>building and open-air camps.  The latest figures indicate that </p><p>only 53 remain.  An assessment was conducted on 26 and 27 April </p><p>that will provide up-to-date estimates.  UNOPS noted that there </p><p>are no IDP emergency needs and is considering returning to its </p><p>pre-war activities.  This remains in question, however, due to </p><p>the unclear future of the U.N. in Iraq because of U.N. Security </p><p>Council Resolution 986, which ends on 3 June. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Prior to military action, UNOPS focused its efforts on the </p><p>social and economic integration of vulnerable IDPs displaced less </p><p>than five years ago.  UNOPS estimates that this group comprised </p><p>approximately 25 percent of the 805,000 IDPs in the North.

Begun in December 2000, UNOPS initial </p><p>activities included the distribution of non-food items (NFIs), </p><p>shelter construction, and rehabilitation of water and sanitation </p><p>systems. </p><p>6.  In preparation for a potential emergency situation resulting </p><p>from the impending military action, UNOPS stockpiled NFIs, </p><p>including 4,000 tents and 8,000 relief packages.  They also </p><p>mapped the locations of public buildings in the three </p><p>governorates that could be used to temporarily house IDPs.  They </p><p>funded a variety of activities, such as transportation and </p><p>garbage collection, to ensure that services were not interrupted </p><p>for vulnerable IDPs housed in public buildings. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>MINISTRY OF HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  The DART also met with the Kurdish Regional Government\'s </p><p>Ministry of Human Rights on 26 April.  The Ministry was created </p><p>in 2001 to promote and protect human rights.  It is particularly </p><p>interested in improving its capacity to deal with children\'s and </p><p>women\'s rights.  The Ministry is involved in civic education and </p><p>strengthening NGOs.  The Ministry also monitors prison and </p><p>juvenile detention center conditions, and it has been supporting </p><p>a center for battered women in Arbil. </p><p> </p><p>8.  School curricula on civic education for all levels (pre- </p><p>school to university) in Kurdish, Arabic, Turkomen, and Aramaic </p><p>have been written by the Ministry and are in first draft form. </p><p>These need to be finalized and printed.  The Ministry is looking </p><p>for funding for this activity, as well as for training of </p><p>teachers, media, police, and other civil servants who may be </p><p>involved in civic education programs. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Ministry has prepared materials for conflict resolution </p><p>and reconciliation training.  The Minister participated in </p><p>conflict resolution and reconciliation training in South Africa, </p><p>and he hopes to replicate those sessions in Iraq.  Notably, the </p><p>Minister did not mention ethnic tensions as a concern until </p><p>raised by team members. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The Minister\'s main agenda in the meeting was to seek </p><p>funding.  Team members explained that DART was not in the </p><p>position to provide financial support to the Ministry and </p><p>suggested that Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian </p><p>Assistance (ORHA) be contacted, particularly in regard to civil </p><p>administration issues. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>11.  WFP has moved over 20,000 MT of food commodities into the </p><p>north.  Eleven 50-MT trucks delivered food supplies to Mosul on </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USAID/W </p><p>STATE PLEASE REPEAT TO IO COLLECTIVE </p><p>STATE FOR PRM/ANE, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA, IO AND SA/PAB </p><p>NSC FOR EABRAMS, SMCCORMICK, STAHIR-KHELI, JDWORKEN </p><p>USAID FOR USAID/A, DCHA/AA, DCHA/RMT, DCHA/FFP </p><p>USAID FOR DCHA/OTI, DCHA/DG, ANE/AA </p><p>USAID FOR DCHA/OFDA:WGARVELINK, BMCCONNELL, KFARNSWORTH USAID FOR </p><p>ANE/AA:WCHAMBERLIN </p><p>ROME FOR FODAG </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA AND NKYLOH </p><p>DOHA FOR MSHIRLEY </p><p>ANKARA FOR AMB WRPEARSON, ECON AJSIROTIC AND DART </p><p>AMMAN FOR USAID AND DART </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREF, WFP, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: DART NORTHERN IRAQ UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>25 April.  Eighty-three were departing from WFP locations in </p><p>Syria on 26 April.  Food flow appears to be moving well in the </p><p>north in most locations.  Security, especially in the Mosul </p><p>region, is still a concern. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WFP has many programs including school feeding, assistance </p><p>to IDPs, and general rations. WFP will continue using the region </p><p>authorities for food distribution, but re-evaluation will be </p><p>necessary.  WFP is evaluating the possibility of purchasing local </p><p>grains left over from last year\'s harvest.  A proper survey is </p><p>required but there are estimates from local officials that there </p><p>is 50,000 to 70,000 MT. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>ICRC </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>13.  The DART met with the ICRC\'s head of sub-delegation in Arbil </p><p>on 24 April to discuss current and future ICRC operations in the </p><p>region.  While ICRC reduced operations during hostilities, they </p><p>expect to be fully staffed by the end of the week with over 20 </p><p>international and 150 local staff.  In the last weeks, ICRC </p><p>provided NFIs, including blankets, heaters, hygienic kits, pots, </p><p>and stoves, to 2,000 to 3,000 vulnerable IDPs crossing from </p><p>Kirkuk and Mosul to Arbil, in Duhok and As Sulaymaniyah </p><p>governorates.  ICRC also provided medical supplies to assist in </p><p>the care of 100 war-wounded, as well as registered enemy </p><p>prisoners of war held by Coalition, KDP, and PUK forces. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Upcoming activities of the ICRC include: further assessments </p><p>of Kirkuk and Mosul, linking families through the creation of </p><p>Thuriya stations where people can call relatives abroad; </p><p>identifying and notifying families of mortal remains; and looking </p><p>at protection issues, including ethnic tensions in Kirkuk and </p><p>Mosul.   According to Giuseppe Renda of the ICRC, "We have just </p><p>ended the first phase; the emergency phase is already over." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
