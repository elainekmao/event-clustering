<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002875 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>. </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT - SHAUN LONERGAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/18/2017 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, KCRM, PREL, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: REACTION TO FATF THREAT OF SANCTIONS </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SUMMARY:  Ambassador Jeter called on Senate President </p><p>Anyim Pius Anyim October 16 to inform him about the gravity </p><p>of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) decision on </p><p>counter-measures due to Nigeria\'s failure to adopt anti-money </p><p>laundering reforms.  The Ambassador told Anyim the FATF </p><p>decision gave Nigeria a reprieve until December 15, which </p><p>placed the onus on the National Assembly to enact needed </p><p>legislation by then. RNLEO accompanied. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) The Ambassador briefed the Senate President on the </p><p>recent history of FATF reviews of Nigeria\'s performance in </p><p>controlling money laundering, emphasizing the lack of </p><p>communication during the months between the late Attorney </p><p>General\'s December 2001 meeting in Rome with the FATF\'s </p><p>Africa and Middle East Review Group (AMERG) and August 2002. </p><p>The FATF has focused on the lack of progress in passing </p><p>legislative amendments expanding the scope of Nigeria\'s </p><p>existing Money Laundering law (which only criminalizes drug </p><p>money laundering) and tightening controls over financial </p><p>institutions other than banks (e.g. stock brokerage firms and </p><p>currency exchange bureaus), Jeter noted.  The FATF again </p><p>reviewed Nigeria\'s progress during its plenary meeting in </p><p>Paris October 9-11 and decided Nigeria had not taken the </p><p>steps recommended over the past two years.  The body then </p><p>agreed to impose counter-measures against Nigeria. </p><p>Recognizing the good-faith efforts made during the last two </p><p>months, however, the FATF gave Nigeria an extra 60 days to </p><p>pass the requisite legislation; barring such progress, the </p><p>counter-measures would take effect December 15, 2002, the </p><p>Ambassador emphasized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) The Senate President agreed with the Ambassador\'s </p><p>assessment that counter-measures would hurt Nigeria and that </p><p>averting this predicament required non-partisan cooperation. </p><p>Anyim promised to consult with the relevant Senate Chairmen </p><p>and lower House leadership to put the legislation on a fast </p><p>track in the Senate and House. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Comment:  Anyim said the right things and we hope he </p><p>means them.  However, he is not much of a statesman and </p><p>sometimes finds it difficult to see beyond his own immediate </p><p>political interests.  However, the case for legislative </p><p>action is clear-cut and we believe Anyim recognized this. </p><p>Yet he also is one of the organizers behind the impeachment </p><p>drive against the President.  We Before he moves on the money </p><p>laundering legislation, he will contemplate how he can use it </p><p>as leverage against Obasanjo, or prevent the Executive from </p><p>somehow using it against him.  We believe he will act quickly </p><p>to pass the legislation if the Executive is successful in </p><p>convincing him that the National Assembly will be stuck with </p><p>the blame for FATF sanctions and, conversely, that Anyim will </p><p>receive credit for the legislation\'s passage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) The Principal Secretary to the President and the </p><p>Attorney General are launching a full court press to this </p><p>goal.  Press coverage of the FATF decision to date has been </p><p>minimal, due to the International Court of Justice\'s October </p><p>10 decision on the Bakassi Peninsula and the ongoing </p><p>political struggle between the executive and legislature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
