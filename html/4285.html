If the Greek and Turkish sides reach a </p><p>compromise before the EU Copenhagen Summit on December 12, </p><p>the agreement for a new Cyprus Constitution will be taken to </p><p>referendum in both Cypriot zones in the island in March.  In </p><p>that case, a united Cyprus would sign agreement for EU </p><p>accession on April 16.  A senior MFA official reportedly </p><p>said Ankara would not hurry to react to the draft, which he </p><p>saw as `long and confusing.\'  The AKP official responsible </p><p>for foreign policy, retired ambassador Yasar Yakis, voiced </p><p>the suspicion that the plan was earlier presented to the </p><p>Greek Cypriots for some `adjustments.\'  The envisioned </p><p>Cyprus state would have a single international identity, but </p><p>would be composed of two autonomous Cyprus states.  The </p><p>island would be demilitarized, and paramilitary units would </p><p>be abolished.  "Cumhuriyet" says the plan contained points </p><p>close to the Turkish thesis.  "Radikal" reports a positive </p><p>first reaction from both Cypriot leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Papers say that despite angry reaction from the Iraqi </p><p>parliament, Baghdad is expected to accept UNSC resolution </p><p>1441.  Dailies report National Security Advisor Rice saying </p><p>U.S. would show `zero tolerance\' to Iraq.  Andrew Card of </p><p>the White House reportedly said if Baghdad violated UNSC </p><p>resolutions, the U.S. would not necessarily seek permission </p><p>from the UN to take military action.  Meanwhile, papers </p><p>report Northern Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) </p><p>leader Talabani\'s visit to Ankara before the November 22 </p><p>Iraqi opposition meeting in Brussels.  Talabani, scheduled </p><p>to meet with MFA and TGS, may pay a courtesy visit to AKP </p><p>leader Erdogan as well, reports say.  Papers claim that MFA </p><p>and TGS have warned AKP and CHP to refrain from receiving </p><p>Talabani. </p><p>Erdogan: AKP leader Erdogan responded to President Sezer\'s </p><p>remarks that the Constitution could not be amended merely to </p><p>meet the specific needs of an individual by saying that AKP </p><p>was tasked by the people to represent the national will, and </p><p>that AKP would not share that authority with others.  AKP is </p><p>not seeking to politicize laws, Erdogan said.  Mainstream </p><p>media believe Erdogan has hardened his stance.  However, </p><p>reaction from President Sezer and CHP leader Baykal has </p><p>forced Erdogan to look for solutions other than </p><p>constitutional change, papers note.  With a minor </p><p>constitutional change, AKP will hold by-elections within </p><p>three months after the opening of parliament, thus paving </p><p>the way for Erdogan to become prime minister.  AKP </p><p>persistence in seeking constitutional changes might </p><p>encourage radical elements in the party to propose further </p><p>amendments on controversial issues like the headscarf ban </p><p>and religious schools, papers comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CIA delegation in Ankara: A 25-member CIA delegation, led by </p><p>the agency\'s deputy director John McLaughlin, arrived in </p><p>Ankara Monday evening, papers report.  McLaughlin is </p><p>expected to discuss the Iraq problem and the fight against </p><p>terrorism with the TGS, MFA and Turkish intelligence (MIT), </p><p>reports say.  McLaughlin will try to convince Turkey to </p><p>allow the use of Northern Iraqi peshmerges in the Iraqi </p><p>operation.  Ankara is concerned that the Northern Iraqi KDP </p><p>and PUK might extract concessions from the U.S. if </p><p>peshmerges are included in Washington\'s Iraq plans.  The </p><p>groups will be given military training and arms, and might </p><p>pose a threat for Turkey in the future, dailies note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) UN Resolution on Iraq </p><p>b) US-Turkey Relations </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The UN resolution will also topple Saddam" </p><p>Ferai Tinc wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (11/10): "The UN </p><p>resolution not only establishes a mechanism for serious </p><p>control over weapons of mass destruction, but also, and more </p><p>importantly, paves the way for a regime change in Iraq </p><p>without the need of war.  With the help of this resolution, </p><p>the Iraqi opposition will now be able to make its presence </p><p>felt. . Looking at the resolution\'s rhetoric, one can </p><p>conclude that the authority provided to the inspectors is </p><p>strong enough to shake Saddam Hussein\'s dictatorship. . </p><p>Baghdad is obliged to comply fully with the UN resolution or </p><p>else pay the consequences of a U.S. military action.  Under </p><p>these strict conditions and obligations, Iraq must </p><p>cooperate.  Let\'s not forget that the UN resolution has </p><p>Syrian approval as well.  What happens if the Baghdad regime </p><p>chooses not to comply?  It will not make much difference for </p><p>the fate of Saddam\'s regime anyway." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US and AKP" </p><p>New York correspondent for mass appeal Sabah, Asli </p><p>Aydintasbas wrote (11/12): "On the eve of a possible Iraq </p><p>operation, the AKP election victory is very much of interest </p><p>to Washington.  AKP has gained huge importance for the US in </p><p>this regard. AKP was not the best alternative for the US, </p><p>but Washington is relieved by recent soft messages by AKP </p><p>leader Erdogan and other party officials.  . Prior to the </p><p>election, AKP had sent some messages to Washington in order </p><p>to reassure the US administration on its stance on Iraq, </p><p>willingness to cooperate with the IMF, willingness to become </p><p>part of the EU, and willingness to work for a solution on </p><p>Cyprus.  . Iraq, Cyprus, and EU membership will be the major </p><p>issues in US-Turkish relations in the immediate future.  US </p><p>officials welcome the positive messages by AKP on these </p><p>important issues following the party\'s election victory. </p><p>Uncertainty about who is to be the Prime Minister of Turkey, </p><p>concerns about the Islamic roots of AKP, and speculation </p><p>about possible tension between the AKP and the military are </p><p>now of secondary importance for the US. . It appears that </p><p>the nature of relations between the AKP and the US </p><p>administration will be shaped significantly by developments </p><p>in Iraq." </p><p></p></div>
