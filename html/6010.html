<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 001785 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ECON, SCUL, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW HESSE CABINET: KOCH PICKS THREE NEW MINISTERS, </p><p>ADDS NEW MINISTRY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: (SBU) After winning an absolute majority in </p><p>February 2 state elections, Hesse Minister-President Roland </p><p>Koch (Christian Democratic Union - CDU) announced three new </p><p>ministers for his state cabinet on February 24.  Two of </p><p>them, Stefan Gruettner (Minister of the State Chancellery) </p><p>and Udo Corts (Minister for Culture, Higher Education and </p><p>Science), were expected.  The new Economics Minister, Alois </p><p>Rhiel, currently the Lord Mayor of Fulda, was a surprise. </p><p>Jochen Riebel will no longer be chief of the State </p><p>Chancellery.  Despite taxpayer criticism, Koch increased the </p><p>number of ministries from nine to ten in response to </p><p>internal party pressure to better balance the cabinet </p><p>geographically.  Koch was also criticized by the CDU women\'s </p><p>caucus and the media for not naming a third female minister. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Short Bios of New CDU Ministers </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Alois Rhiel, the new Hesse Minister for Economics, </p><p>Transport and Development is Lord Mayor of Fulda.  Before </p><p>that, he was a manager for the Tegut grocery store chain. </p><p>His previous position in government was as Commissioner for </p><p>the town of Giessen in 1991.  Rhiel is a good contact of the </p><p>Consulate and has supported various U.S.-German initiatives </p><p>in Fulda.  The new minister is a moderate CDU politician, </p><p>has an economics background, and is open to new ideas in </p><p>environmental policy.  Rhiel is from eastern Hesse and </p><p>claims to represent north Hesse in the cabinet.  By </p><p>replacing former Economics Minister Posch (a true north </p><p>Hessian) with Rhiel, Koch has increased the influence of </p><p>eastern Hesse while preserving north Hesse\'s standing in the </p><p>Cabinet, at least on paper.  Some in the north Hesse CDU </p><p>complain they had hoped for a bigger reward for delivering a </p><p>strong CDU election victory in a traditionally Social </p><p>Democratic Party (SPD) region. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Udo Corts, Minister for Culture, Higher Education </p><p>and Science, replaces outgoing minister Ruth Wagner (FDP). </p><p>By winning his constituency in Frankfurt, Corts guaranteed </p><p>himself a place in the Cabinet.  However, his nomination as </p><p>Minister for Higher Education came as a surprise.  While </p><p>acknowledged as a talented administrator, Corts has no </p><p>background in the area of education policy.  Previously </p><p>State Secretary in the Interior Ministry, Corts is seen as a </p><p>potential successor to Koch as Minister-President of Hesse. </p><p>Corts is also Chairman of the Frankfurt CDU and was </p><p>Commissioner for Construction in Frankfurt before joining </p><p>the Interior Ministry.  He is a Consulate International </p><p>Visitor candidate this year. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Stefan Gruettner, Minister of the State </p><p>Chancellery, is one of ConGen Frankfurt\'s best contacts in </p><p>the Hesse CDU parliamentary group and a successful state </p><p>parliamentary caucus manager.  His promotion to the State </p><p>Chancellery is no surprise.  Gruettner is from the more </p><p>conservative side of the party and his relations with the </p><p>new parliamentary group chairman Franz Josef Jung are known </p><p>to be rocky.  Had Gruettner stayed on as parliamentary </p><p>caucus manager, Jung would have asked for his resignation. </p><p>Gruettner will become Koch\'s "right hand" in this new </p><p>position.  Gruettner was the CDU chairman of the CDU </p><p>donation scandal investigation committee and did a good job </p><p>helping restore respectability to the party.  Though </p><p>competent in several policy areas, his background is mainly </p><p>in social policy.  Gruettner is originally from Offenbach, </p><p>and was Offenbach Commissioner for Social Affairs from 1991- </p><p>1995. </p><p> </p><p>New State Secretary </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Oda Scheidelhuber\'s appointment to State Secretary </p><p>in the Interior Ministry, is another concession to the north </p><p>Hesse region, where Koch received a great deal of voter </p><p>support in recent elections.  Koch was criticized, however, </p><p>for not promoting a woman to a minister position. </p><p>Scheidelhuber is considered by some to be one of two token </p><p>women in the cabinet.  As Regierungspraesidentin in Kassel, </p><p>Scheidelhuber is known for making the north Hesse district </p><p>administration more service-oriented. </p><p> </p><p>Other Changes in the Hesse Cabinet </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Jochen Riebel is now Minister for Federal </p><p>(Bundesrat) and European Affairs and becomes the state\'s </p><p>representative in Berlin, but has lost the State Chancellery </p><p>to Gruettner (see above para 4).  (Note: By splitting these </p><p>two functions, Koch has created a new ministry.  End Note.) </p><p>Koch has stated publicly that this change is not an </p><p>expression of any lack of confidence in the minister and </p><p>that Riebel\'s portfolio will be strengthened according to </p><p>the Bavarian model.  Many doubt this.  Riebel is seen as </p><p>lackluster, overwhelmed by his work and without much of a </p><p>political future.  His new role will be more representative </p><p>than substantive. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Successors for Stefan Gruettner and Oda Scheidelhuber </p><p>have not been announced yet.  The following positions remain </p><p>unchanged (all are CDU): </p><p> </p><p>Karin Wolf, Minister for Education and new Deputy Minister </p><p>President. </p><p> </p><p>Volker Bouffier, Interior Minister. </p><p>Christean Wagner, Justice Minister. </p><p> </p><p>Wilhelm Dietzel, Agriculture and Environment Minister. </p><p> </p><p>Karlheinz Weimar, Finance Minister. </p><p> </p><p>Silke Lautenschlaeger, Social Minister. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Koch was apparently driven by internal party </p><p>pressure to change the geographic balance of the cabinet. </p><p>Frankfurt, Fulda and north Hesse felt under-represented in </p><p>the previous Koch administration.  The overall number of </p><p>ministries has been increased to ten, a move criticized by </p><p>the League of Taxpayers.  The number of female ministers was </p><p>reduced by one, despite the Cabinet\'s expansion and lobbying </p><p>by the CDU women\'s caucus.  The new cabinet has more </p><p>representatives from cities, Gruettner, Corts, Rhiel and </p><p>Scheidelhuber.  Koch was also criticized previously for not </p><p>having adequate representation of the more liberal wing of </p><p>the Hesse CDU, now also corrected with Corts, Rhiel and </p><p>Scheidelhuber.  Despite winning an absolute majority in </p><p>February elections, Koch may have a difficult five years </p><p>ahead of him.  Fifty-three of the new state parliament </p><p>members won their constituencies directly.  Koch will thus </p><p>have many "little kings" to deal with. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
