(SBU) SUMMARY: We look forward to your upcoming visit.  It </p><p>comes at a key decision time for Turkey.  US-Turkey relations </p><p>have been dominated recently by Iraq.  Should the Turks </p><p>continue delaying a decision to support US military requests </p><p>related to Iraq, our close regional, economic, and strategic </p><p>cooperation could be in question.  Over the last two years </p><p>the US has supported Turkish economic reforms and recovery </p><p>from its worst economic crisis in decades.  Despite the </p><p>concentration on Iraq, the strategic partnership has grown as </p><p>a result of Turkey\'s significant support in the global war on </p><p>terrorism, including taking leadership of the International </p><p>Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.  Over the </p><p>last six months, the governing coalition of Bulent Ecevit </p><p>crumbled and was replaced in November elections by the first </p><p>majority government in over ten years.  The new </p><p>Islam-influenced AK Party, which holds almost two-thirds of </p><p>the seats in Parliament, is now facing numerous external </p><p>challenges including Turkey\'s EU candidacy, Cyprus, and Iraq. </p><p> END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Political-Military Issues </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Iraq: The US and Turkey have been engaged in intense </p><p>and detailed discussions about Iraq for the last 11 months, </p><p>including the possibility of military operations.  The </p><p>Turkish public overwhelmingly opposes military action against </p><p>Iraq and opening Turkish bases to the US.  The GOT is not </p><p>enthusiastic about working against that trend.  Turks fear </p><p>that an Iraq war would have a serious negative economic </p><p>impact on them and could lead to increased instability next </p><p>door and in Turkey\'s restive southeast.  On Feb. 6 the </p><p>Turkish Parliament authorized deployment of US forces to </p><p>prepare sites for a full US deployment here.  We understood </p><p>that the Turkish Parliament would consider support for US </p><p>troops Feb. 18.  That vote has been delayed.  Whether there </p><p>will be a US-Turkish agreement resulting in Parliamentary </p><p>authorization remains an open question. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Operation Northern Watch: Turkey continues to </p><p>support Operation Northern Watch (the northern no-fly zone) </p><p>based out of Incirlik, which was again renewed for six months </p><p>on Christmas Day.  The Turks also have good relations with </p><p>the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and had a visit from </p><p>Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Masoud Barzani the first </p><p>week of January which helped put what had become a tense and </p><p>unhappy relationship back on a more cooperative footing.  The </p><p>Turks are strong supporters of the Iraqi Turkmen Front, and </p><p>have recently begun meeting for the first time with Iraqi </p><p>opposition groups other than the KDP, PUK, and the ITF.  The </p><p>Turks met jointly with the KDP, PUK, ITF and the US </p><p>Presidential Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Ankara at the </p><p>beginning of February to discuss visions of a post-Saddam </p><p>Iraq.  All participants agreed to coordinate future efforts </p><p>in this regard. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Global War on Terrorism: Immediately after 9/11, </p><p>Turkey opened its infrastructure to the US military for the </p><p>GWOT and supported the invocation of Article V at NATO. </p><p>Turkey has granted clearance to over 8000 US sorties in </p><p>support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in and through </p><p>Turkey. The GOT has also offered special operations forces </p><p>and aerial refuelers for Operation Enduring Freedom.  But </p><p>chief among the GOT\'s contribution was its agreement to take </p><p>over leadership of the International Security Assistance </p><p>Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan in June 2002, which it </p><p>relinquished on February 10 . </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) NATO: Ankara was supportive of the US agenda at the </p><p>NATO Prague Summit in November, including our push for NATO </p><p>expansion and improved capabilities.  Turkey\'s primary </p><p>concern is keeping the three NATO commands currently located </p><p>in Turkey after the command structure review is conducted in </p><p>Brussels which seeks to streamline (and thus cut) the number </p><p>of commands.  Turkey has relied heavily on US support at NATO </p><p>to gain approval for planning for the defense of Turkey in </p><p>the event of an attack from Iraq.  Approval for such planning </p><p>by NATO military authorities was given Feb. 16 after four </p><p>weeks of debate in Brussels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Arms Sales:  A $1.1 billion contract for four Boeing </p><p>AEW&C aircraft was signed last June.  Since then, contract </p><p>effectively has been delayed twice because of GOT </p><p>dissatisfaction with USG restrictions on certain technology </p><p>transfer as well as other commercial issues.  These problems </p><p>are working their way to resolution, and we hope for </p><p>effectivity by early March.  Meanwhile, a $2.0 billion </p><p>contract negotiation with Bell-Textron for 50 attack </p><p>helicopters has been stalled by price issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Political Scene </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The AK Party won a major victory on Nov. 3 and </p><p>controls 362 (of 550) seats in the legislature.  After </p><p>assuming power Nov. 18, AK moved quickly to promote Turkey\'s </p><p>EU candidacy by passing a package of long overdue human </p><p>rights reforms, and with strong USG support garnered an EU </p><p>conditional date of end-2004 for the beginning of formal EU </p><p>accession talks.  In other areas, AK\'s inexperience and lack </p><p>of expertise is hampering decisions on complex issues and is </p><p>preventing application of the clean government and economic </p><p>and democratic reform program it promised.  AK, with its </p><p>roots in Islamic politics, is further handicapped by poor </p><p>relations with traditional State institutions that are loath </p><p>to tolerate most expressions of religiosity, and which see AK </p><p>as a challenge to the status quo.   In this regard, the </p><p>judiciary launched a case to close AK some 10 days before the </p><p>last elections.  On Jan. 8, Turkish General Staff issued a </p><p>strong warning to AK -- whose poll numbers have been on the </p><p>upswing since the elections -- to abandon policies allegedly </p><p>at odds with the secularist principles of the Kemalist </p><p>Republic.  The political ban against AK leader R. Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan will run its course by late February.  He has already </p><p>announced his candidacy for Parliament in the special March 9 </p><p>election in Siirt province, but his candidacy may still be </p><p>challenged by the election board or judiciary.  If Erdogan is </p><p>allowed to stand, and wins, the way will be cleared for his </p><p>assumption of the prime ministership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Cyprus </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) AK Government has been far ahead of its predecessors </p><p>in pushing for a solution on Cyprus -- and has pressed "TRNC </p><p>President" Denktas to negotiate on the draft UN Cyprus </p><p>settlement plan.  Negotiations to reach a solution in the </p><p>decades-old Cyprus dispute continue, against the backdrop of </p><p>unprecedented, massive demonstrations in Turkish Cyprus aimed </p><p>at both Denktas and the Turkish Establishment that has long </p><p>nurtured him.  AK leader Erdogan and other AK officials have </p><p>openly criticized Denktas and by implication Turkey\'s </p><p>traditional policy.  However, while working toward an </p><p>agreement, Turkey has yet to obtain a package it deems </p><p>acceptable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Current UN efforts call for the parties to complete </p><p>a deal by February 28, which would allow sufficient time for </p><p>a settlement to be incorporated into Cyprus\' EU accession </p><p>treaty.  (The EU at its December summit in Copenhagen agreed </p><p>to admit Cyprus; the treaty will be signed in April). </p><p>Turkish sensitivities include: 1) the need to maintain </p><p>security for Turkish Cypriots (and mainland Turkish </p><p>"strategic" interests on the island); 2) the question of </p><p>territorial adjustments and the right of displaced Greek </p><p>Cypriots to return to (or seek restitution for) their former </p><p>properties; and 3) the equal status of Turkish Cyprus within </p><p>the new partner state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Economic Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Economic Crisis: Although nearly two years of </p><p>IMF-backed economic reform have laid the foundation for </p><p>greater financial stability and growth, Turkey\'s enormous </p><p>public debt burden and structural weaknesses keep the economy </p><p>fragile.  The key during 2003 is to maintain market </p><p>confidence, so investors will continue to lend the government </p><p>the massive amounts it needs to avoid a debt default. </p><p>Markets initially greeted the AK election  victory, and AK\'s </p><p>commitment to further economic reform, with a rally.  So far, </p><p>however, the government\'s performance has been disappointing. </p><p> Rather than pursue reform, the government has adopted </p><p>populist spending policies and moved to dismantle some key </p><p>reforms.  Strong international and market pressure over the </p><p>past month have forced the government to respond, including </p><p>with announcements of new fiscal and privatization measures, </p><p>but it is still not clear whether the government will </p><p>implement the full reform program.  Expectations of a large </p><p>U.S. bilateral assistance package in the context of an Iraq </p><p>operation have propped up markets despite disappointment with </p><p>the government\'s policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Trade Relationship: In January 2002, President Bush </p><p>and then-Prime Minister Ecevit committed to enhance the </p><p>bilateral economic relationship.  One pillar of that </p><p>initiative is superb cooperation on building an East-West </p><p>energy corridor to bring Caspian oil and gas through Turkey </p><p>to the West.  The U.S. administration has also submitted </p><p>Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ) legislation to the Congress. </p><p> Turkish expectations about US economic support remain high, </p><p>particularly in the context of a possible Iraq operation. </p><p>They are looking to the U.S. to provide substantial financial </p><p>support to offset expected losses and keep the overall </p><p>economy afloat, and to offer new trade initiatives to boost </p><p>exports and offset possible job losses.  In the Turkish view, </p><p>both types of assistance are essential for the government </p><p>justify cooperation in the face of widespread public </p><p>opposition to an operation. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
