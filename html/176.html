<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 TUNIS 11489 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TS </p><p>SUBJECT:  BEN ALI AS PRIME MINISTER:  WHAT DOES IT MEAN? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  TUNIS 11130 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  BOURGUIBA\'S ABRUPT DISMISSAL OF SFAR AND </p><p>ELEVATION OF INTERIOR MINISTER BEN ALI AGAIN </p><p>DEMONSTRATES PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA\'S PERSONAL CONTROL </p><p>OF POWER IN TUNISIA.  BEN ALI\'S APPOINTMENT PUTS A </p><p>STRONG MAN IN THE PRIME MINISTRY AND A HEARTBEAT AWAY </p><p>FROM THE PRESIDENCY.  IN GOVERNING, BEN ALI WILL HAVE </p><p>SUPPORT FROM SOCIAL AFFAIRS MINISTER BACCOUCHE, CHIEF </p><p>OF STAFF BARKETT AND PRESIDENTIAL COMPANION SAIDA </p><p>SASSI.  ON THE OTHER HAND, BEN ALI WILL PROBABLY BE </p><p>AT ODDS WITH PSD DIRECTOR MAHJOUB BEN ALI.  BEN ALI\'S </p><p>RAPPORT WITH EDUCATION MINISTER SAYAH DESERVES </p><p>PARTICULAR ATTENTION.  ADDITIONAL CABINET CHANGES ARE </p><p>WIDELY RUMORED--THE ECONOMIC MINISTRIES, JUSTICE, AND </p><p>POSSIBLY DEFENSE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  BEN ALI\'S MOST </p><p>DRAMATIC POLICY SIGNAL HAS BEEN A CALL FOR </p><p>RESPONSIBLE DIALOGUE AND DIRECT CONTACT WHICH WAS </p><p>FOLLOWED UP BY MEETINGS WITH HUMAN RIGHTS LEADERS. </p><p>U.S. INTERESTS ARE WELL SERVED BY BEN ALI\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENT SINCE IT WILL ENHANCE STABILITY IN THE </p><p>NEAR AND LONGER TERM.  WHILE HE IS NOT "AMERICA\'S </p><p>MAN,"  HE CARRIES NO IDEOLOGICAL BAGGAGE WHICH WOULD </p><p>IMPEDE CLOSE WORKING RELATIONS.  U.S. INTERESTS ARE </p><p>ALSO SERVED BY BEN ALI\'S TENTATIVE OPENING TO CRITICS </p><p>WHICH SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>BOURGUIBA MAINTAINS CONTROL </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (NO FORN) - PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA HAS AGAIN </p><p>DEMONSTRATED HIS PERSONAL CONTROL OF TUNISIAN </p><p>POLITICS BY ABRUPTLY DISMISSING RACHID SFAR AND </p><p>ELEVATING PRIME MINISTER BEN ALI (REFTEL) TO THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTRY.  SFAR\'S DISMISSAL WAS EXPLAINED LAST </p><p>WEEK AS A RESULT OF PRESIDENTIAL DISSATISFACTION WITH </p><p>THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER\'S ATTEMPT TO DESIGNATE HIS </p><p>CANDIDATE, ABDELMALEK AL \'ARIF, AS DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>RULING DESTOURIAN SOCIALIST PARTY (PSD).  THAT </p><p>EXPLANATION HAS GAINED CREDIBILITY BY THE SUBSEQUENT </p><p>REPORT IN A LEADING NEWSPAPER THAT BOURGUIBA AND SFAR </p><p>FIRST CLASHED OVER APPOINTMENTS SEPT. 10 WHEN SFAR </p><p>PROPOSED AL \'ARIF AS MINISTER OF INFORMATION, ONLY TO </p><p>HAVE THE PRESIDENT OVERRULE HIM AND APPOINT </p><p>ABDELWAHAB ABDULLAH TO THAT POST.  A SIRO SOURCE </p><p>REPORTED THAT BOURGUIBA PROPOSED THE PRIME MINISTRY </p><p>TO BEN ALI SEPT. 13 BUT THE LATTER RECOMMENDED THE </p><p>CHANGE TAKE PLACE AFTER THE MTI TRIAL WHICH CONCLUDED </p><p>SEPT. 27.  NEVERTHELESS, THE CHANGE ITSELF WAS </p><p>HANDLED CLUMSILY WITH THE PRESIDENT PLACING HIMSELF </p><p>IN THE EMBARRASSING POSITION OF APPROVING HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>APPOINTMENTS ONE DAY--I.E PARTY CHIEF, MINISTER OF </p><p>CULTURE ETC.--ONLY TO RETRACT THEM THE NEXT.  BY </p><p>SEVERAL RELIABLE ACCOUNTS, THE PRESIDENT WAS ALSO </p><p>EXTRAORDINARILY ABUSIVE TO FORMER PRIME MINISTER </p><p>SFAR, AT THE CABINET MEETING SEPT. 30, WHO PROTESTED </p><p>ALL ALONG THAT HE HAD ACTED WITH PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>APPROVAL.  HENCE, THE PRESIDENT HAS SIMULTANEOUSLY </p><p>REASSERTED PRESIDENTIAL PREROGATIVES WHILE RAISING </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS GRIP ON EVENTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  LIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, BEN ALI\'S RAPPORT WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT WILL BE A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN HIS ABILITY TO </p><p>GOVERN.  ON SECURITY ISSUES, HE HAS SHOWN A DEFT </p><p>TOUCH -- E.G. OPPOSING THE CREATION OF MTI MARTYRS </p><p>WITHOUT LOOSING CREDIBILITY.  BEN ALI\'S FIRST </p><p>OFFICIAL STATEMENT CAREFULLY ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL PREROGATIVES AND CHARACTERIZED THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER AS FIRST AMONG EQUALS IN SERVING THE </p><p>PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>A STRONGMAN A HEARTBEAT AWAY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNLIKE SFAR, BEN ALI IS NOT VIEWED AS A </p><p>TRANSITIONAL FIGURE.  ANY PRIME MINISTER SERVES AT </p><p>THE PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT AND BOURGUIBA HAS NEVER </p><p>TOLERATED A TRULY POWERFUL PRIME MINISTER IN THE </p><p>PAST.  NEVERTHELESS BEN ALI\'S TENURE IS MORE SECURE </p><p>THAN HIS PREDECESSOR\'S BECAUSE HE IS A PILLAR OF </p><p>TUNISIA\'S INTERNAL SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT -- NOT </p><p>IRREPLACEABLE, BUT NOT EASILY REPLACED.  WITH BEN </p><p>ALI\'S APPOINTMENT, THE ENTIRE SUCCESSION PICTURE HAS </p><p>OBVIOUSLY CHANGED.  INSTEAD OF A WEAK PROSPECTIVE </p><p>PRESIDENT WHO WOULD HAVE INVITED CHALLENGES FROM </p><p>POLITICAL OPPONENTS, THERE IS A STRONG AND VIGOROUS </p><p>SUCCESSOR.  WHATEVER ELSE HAPPENS, THE INTERNAL </p><p>SECURITY SITUATION IS NOT LIKELY TO GET OUT OF HAND </p><p>AS LONG AS THERE IS NO OPEN SPLIT IN THE RULING </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>ALLIES </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>4. BEN ALI\'S ALLIES IN THE GOVERNMENT ARE STRONG AND </p><p>WELL PLACED.  FIRST AND FOREMOST IS SOCIAL AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER BACCOUCHE WHO ALSO COMES FROM HAMMAM SOUSSE </p><p>AND IS AN OLD PERSONAL FRIEND.  BACCOUCHE IS PRESUMED </p><p>TO BE BEN ALI\'S PRIMARY POLITICAL ADVISOR.  AN ADROIT </p><p>POLITICIAN, BACCOUCHE WAS PSD DIRECTOR (1983-86) AND </p><p>IS CURRENTLY MANAGING TUNISIA\'S NEGOTIATIONS WITH </p><p>LIBYA AND THEIR IMPACT ON HER RELATIONS WITH ALGERIA </p><p>AND MOROCCO.  BACCOUCHE\'S MAJOR LIABILITY IS THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S ANTIPATHY FOR HIM WHICH STEMS IN PART AT </p><p>LEAST FROM BACCOUCHE\'S INDEPENDENT ATTITUDE AS PARTY </p><p>DIRECTOR.  SECOND, CHIEF OF STAFF BARKETT THINKS </p><p>HIGHLY OF BEN ALI AND HAS MAINTAINED REGULAR </p><p>CONTACT.  INDEED, BARKETT WAS THE ONLY SENIOR </p><p>MILITARY FIGURE WHO FAILED TO ATTEND A DINNER AT THE </p><p>FRENCH EMBASSY ON THE EVE OF THE GOVERNMENT CHANGE, </p><p>WHICH HAS PRODUCED SPECULATION THAT HE ALONE IN THE </p><p>DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT WAS INFORMED AND CONSULTED BY </p><p>BEN ALI IN ADVANCE.  THIRD, PRESIDENTIAL COMPANION </p><p>SAIDA SASSI WAS OBSERVED AS AN ALMOST DAILY VISITOR </p><p>TO THE INTERIOR MINISTRY IN RECENT WEEKS.  SHE HAS </p><p>EVEN PLACED PHONE CALLS FROM BEN ALI\'S OFFICE.  BY </p><p>SEVERAL ACCOUNTS, BEN ALI SUCCEEDED IN CONVINCING </p><p>SASSI TO COUNSEL MODERATION TO THE PRESIDENT IN THE </p><p>MTI TRIAL.  THE BEN ALI-SASSI CONNECTION DOES NOT </p><p>APPEAR TO BE DEEPLY ROOTED AND MAY NOT ENDURE. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>ADVERSARIES </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>6. BEN ALI HAS GENERALLY NOT ENGENDERED PERSONAL </p><p>ANTIMOSITY.  NEVERTHELESS, HE HAS POLITICAL RIVALS </p><p>AND PERSONAL ANTIPATHIES. THE NEW PSD DIRECTOR </p><p>MAHJOUB BEN ALI IS THOUGHT TO BE ON A TOTALLY </p><p>DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH THAN THE PRIME MINISTER.  PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BEN ALI IS MORE SUBTLE AND SEES THE NUANCES </p><p>OF A SITUATION.  PSD DIRECTOR BEN ALI IS A BLUNT </p><p>INSTRUMENT.  MOREOVER, THE PSD\'S NEWLY RE-ACTIVATED </p><p>MILITIA\'S ARE HELD IN CONTEMPT BY THE PROFESSIONAL </p><p>SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT AND THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN </p><p>SEVERAL RELATIVELY MINOR CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO GROUPS.  PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA PRESUMABLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE INCOMPATIBILITY AND NAMED MAHJOUB IN </p><p>PART AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE NEW PRIME MINISTER. </p><p>PRIME MINISTER BEN ALI ALSO REPORTEDLY DISLIKES </p><p>MINISTER OF TRANSPORT, HOUSING AND EQUIPMENT SKHIRI </p><p>WHO HIMSELF ALMOST CERTAINLY ASPIRED TO HEAD THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  SKHIRI HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>CORRUPTION IN THE PAST AND HAS REPORTEDLY MISMANAGED </p><p>HIS MINISTRY SO HE IS NOT IN A PARTICULARLY STRONG </p><p>POSITION.  EDUCATION MINISTER SAYAH WOULD BE A MUCH </p><p>MORE FORMIDABLE ADVERSARY GIVEN HIS PERSONAL RAPPORT </p><p>WITH THE PRESIDENT (HE IS BOURGUIBA\'S BIOGRAPHER) AND </p><p>DEEP AND WIDE PARTY CONNECTIONS.  BECAUSE OF HIS </p><p>POLITICAL SKILLS, SAYAH WAS FOR MANY THE LEADING </p><p>CANDIDATE TO SUCCEED SFAR AND EVENTUALLY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HIMSELF.  HE NOW FINDS A FORMIDABLE </p><p>OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF THOSE AMBITIONS.  SAYAH\'S ONLY </p><p>HINT OF DISATISFACTION THUS FAR WAS A PUBLIC COMMENT </p><p>PRIOR TO THE GOVERNMENT CHANGE TO THE EFFECT THAT </p><p>TUNISIA HAS BEEN AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE LEAD BY </p><p>CIVILIANS -- A POSSIBLE REFERENCE TO BEN ALI\'S </p><p>MILITARY BACKGROUND.  THE SAYAH-BEN ALI RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BEARS WATCHING. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>MORE CABINET CHANGES? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  SINCE BEN ALI\'S APPOINTMENT, TUNIS\' RUMOR MILLS </p><p>HAVE BEEN WORKING OVERTIME AND FURTHER CABINET </p><p>CHANGES ARE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY EXPECTED.  MUCH OF THE </p><p>SPECULATIONS HAS FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMIC MINISTRIES. </p><p>THE PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY MADE A SLIGHTING REMARK IN </p><p>THE SEPT. 30 CABINET MEETING ABOUT MINISTER OF PLAN </p><p>KHELIL\'S FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE U.S.  (HE HAS BEEN IN </p><p>WASHINGTON FOR IMF MEETINGS.)  BEN ALI, WHOSE </p><p>ECONOMIC EXPERIENCE IS NIL, IS ALSO PERCEIVED TO NEED </p><p>HELP PARTICULARLY IN THIS DOMAIN.  JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>AYARI IS ALSO THOUGHT TO BE BURNT OUT.  MOREOVER, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT WAS REPORTEDLY NOT PLEASED WITH THE COURSE </p><p>OF THE MTI TRIAL.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S </p><p>DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE PRESIDENT EARLIER THIS SUMMER </p><p>AND TOTAL EXCLUSION FROM RECENT MAGHREB DIPLOMACY </p><p>HAVE ALSO RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS STATUS.  DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER BALY\'S NAME IS ALSO MENTIONED AS SOMEONE WHO </p><p>MIGHT BE CHANGED TO BRING NEW BLOOD INTO THE GOT. </p><p>ONE LEADING CANDIDATE FOR A MINISTRY IS TUNISIA\'S </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO BONN BEJI CAID ESSEBSI, A FORMER </p><p>MINISTER OF INTERIOR AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS, WHO HAD </p><p>BEEN IN TUNIS THIS PAST WEEK AND IS EXPECTED BACK </p><p>LATER THIS WEEK.  UN PERMREP MESTIRI HAS ALSO BEEN </p><p>MENTIONED AS A CANDIDATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>POLICY CHANGES: DIALOGUE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS LEADERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>8. BEN ALI\'S ONE CLEAR POLICY INITIATIVE HAS BEEN A </p><p>SLIGHT OPENING TO THE REGIME\'S CRITICS.  IN HIS </p><p>INITIAL POLICY STATEMENT AS PRIME MINISTER, HE CALLED </p><p>FOR "A REINFORCEMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY BASED ON </p><p>BOURGUIBIAN PRINCIPLES OF DIRECT CONTACT, RESPONSIBLE </p><p>DIALOGUE AND CONCORD TO SERVE TUNISIA\'S HIGHER </p><p>INTERESTS AND TO SAFEGUARD TUNISIA\'S STABILITY AND </p><p>INVULNERABILITY."  SUBSEQUENTLY, HE MET ON OCT. 6 IN </p><p>SEPARATE AND HIGHLY-PUBLICIZED MEETINGS WITH THE </p><p>LEADERS OF THE INDEPENDENT TUNISIAN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>LEAGUE AND GOT-CONTROLLED ASSOCIATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>AND PUBLIC LIBERTIES.  THESE GESTURES HAVE BEEN WELL </p><p>RECEIVED.  OPPOSITION POLITICIANS WITH WHOM BEN ALI </p><p>MAINTAINED CONTACTS AS INTERIOR MINISTER ARE NO DOUBT </p><p>HOPING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER\'S ATTENTION WILL </p><p>EVENTUALLY EXTEND TO THEM.  IF SO, IT WILL BE A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>U.S. INTERESTS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  U.S. INTERESTS ARE WELL SERVED BY BEN ALI\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENT.  IN THE NEAR TERM, IT ENHANCES STABILITY </p><p>AT A TIME WHEN THE MTI CHALLENGE HAS BEEN BLUNTED, </p><p>BUT NOT RESOLVED AND WHEN TUNISIA IS MOVING TOWARD A </p><p>MORE NORMAL AND OPEN RELATIONSHIP WITH LIBYA.  IN THE </p><p>LONGER TERM, SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN TO THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>BEN ALI WOULD BE ALMOST THE IDEAL PERSON TO MAINTAIN </p><p>ORDER IN THE TRANSITION.  HE IS NOT "AMERICA\'S MAN" </p><p>-- A WIDELY HELD PERCEPTION IN TUNIS BASED ON BEN </p><p>ALI\'S REPUTATION FOR "LAW AND ORDER" AND HIS LIMITED </p><p>STUDY AS A SOLDIER IN THE U.S.  RATHER HE IS </p><p>DISTINCTLY NON-IDEOLOGICAL.  NEVERTHELESS, THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF INTELLECTUAL BAGGAGE--I.E. MZALI\'S </p><p>AMBITION TO BRING TUNISIA CLOSER TO THE ARAB WORLD, </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER MABROUK\'S FRANCOPHILIA, ETC. -- IS </p><p>AN ADVANTAGE AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED.  ALSO IN </p><p>U.S. INTERESTS IS BEN ALI\'S TENTATIVE OPENING TO THE </p><p>REGIME\'S CRITICS.  AT A MINIMUM, HE HAS ENDORSED THE </p><p>LEGITIMACY OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVITY IN TUNISIA. </p><p>WHETHER HE PROCEEDS FARTHER TOWARD POLITICAL </p><p>PLURALISM WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS -- PRINCIPALLY </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S ACQUIESCENCE OR RESISTANCE.  IT IS A </p><p>TENDENCY, HOWEVER, THAT THE U.S. SHOULD ENCOURAGE. </p><p> </p><p>PELLETREAU## </p><p></p></div>
