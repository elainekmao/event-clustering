KATHMANDU 1097 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 0902 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  According to a representative from a Swiss </p><p>NGO, the Government of Nepal (GON) peace negotiation team has </p><p>agreed in principle to accept outside "negotiation support," </p><p>to be provided to both the GON and Maoist insurgents. </p><p>Despite the delay in peace talks, the recent change in </p><p>government, and the Maoists\' increasingly belligerent </p><p>rhetoric, the NGO representative, who maintains regular </p><p>contact with insurgent ideologue Baburam Bhattarai, expressed </p><p>confidence that the Maoists are not prepared to walk away </p><p>from the table.  The newly established Peace Secretariat is </p><p>not yet fully operational, its one-man staff primarily </p><p>engaged in hiring new personnel and securing office space. </p><p>Once peace talks resume, the Secretariat will be responsible </p><p>for managing paper flow, "implementing" the decisions reached </p><p>during negotiations, and acting as a liaison between the </p><p>Government talk team and the media, NGOs, and the donor </p><p>community.  While the GON plainly needs outside assistance in </p><p>training both negotiators and Secretariat staff, it remains </p><p>unclear if the new administration of Prime Minister Thapa </p><p>will be more receptive to outside participation in this </p><p>sensitive area.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>NEW GOVERNMENT MAY ACCEPT </p><p>OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE IN TALKS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On June 26 Andrew Marshall (protect) of the Center </p><p>for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD) in Geneva told poloff that </p><p>newly apppointed Information Minister and GON talk team </p><p>spokesman Kamal Thapa had agreed to accept limited </p><p>"negotiation support" from the Swiss organization.  (Note: </p><p>Marshall is a semi-frequent visitor to Kathmandu whose </p><p>organization had offered similar support to both sides for </p><p>negotiations during the 2001 negotiations under Prime </p><p>Minister Deuba and the two rounds of negotiations held under </p><p>the Chand government in April and May.  The GON had not </p><p>previously agreed to the assistance.  Marshall maintains </p><p>regular contact with Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai.  End </p><p>note.)  Marshall, whose organization has no permanent </p><p>presence in Nepal, said that HD had already decided to keep </p><p>one staff member in country indefinitely for the time being. </p><p>The staff member has already begun providing some limited </p><p>assistance to the four Nepali facilitators who participated </p><p>in the last two rounds of dialogue, setting up office space </p><p>for them in a Kathmandu hotel and helping them better define </p><p>their role. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Marshall indicated that the "negotiation support" </p><p>his organizatin will offer will focus, to a large degree, on </p><p>training members of both sides on negotiating techniques and </p><p>strategy.  The GON has not thus far developed a strategy, he </p><p>opined, and neither side is giving appropriate focus to </p><p>confidence-building measures or "deliverables" that create a </p><p>sense of progress in a peace process.  The GON attitude </p><p>toward dialogue to date has been haphazard, he continued, </p><p>which adds to the Maoists\' frustration at the lack of </p><p>progress.  He cited the continuing controversy about whether </p><p>the GON had agreed during the last round of talks to restrict </p><p>the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) to within 5 km of barracks (Ref B) </p><p>as one pitfall that could have been averted by better </p><p>training and preparation on both sides.  (Note:  Several </p><p>sources have confirmed to us that no one on either talk team </p><p>nor any of the four facilitators took notes or kept written </p><p>records of the two rounds of dialogue that have taken place </p><p>so far.  GON negotiators, according to one well-placed </p><p>source, attended both rounds "without even a piece of paper" </p><p>in hand to guide their discussion.  According to one </p><p>anecdote, when one participant asked to borrow a pen to jot </p><p>something down during the last round, none of the 15 people </p><p>in the room could produce one.  End note.) </p><p>4.  (C)  Marshall said the offer for assistance is open to </p><p>both sides--a point he claimed Thapa knows and accepts. </p><p>Training would also be made available to the GON\'s newly </p><p>formed Peace Secretariat.  Marshall said he is optimistic </p><p>that the Maoists will respond favorably to the offer as well, </p><p>although he admitted not having made contact with them during </p><p>this latest visit.  (Note:  Each of the five Maoist </p><p>negotiators is apparently out of town and out of sight for </p><p>the time being.  Speculation is rampant that some or all may </p><p>have returned to India.  End note.)  HD will keep any </p><p>assistance low-key and behind the scenes, Marshall </p><p>emphasized, and has no immediate plans to increase either its </p><p>staff or its visibility here.  For this reason, he has </p><p>decided not to consult with the Indian government--which is </p><p>widely believed to have discouraged the GON from accepting </p><p>third-party assistance in the past.  As long as the </p><p>assistance remains discreet, he reasoned, the Indians may </p><p>decide to overlook it.  Formally notifying the Indian </p><p>government of the proposed assistance, on the other hand, </p><p>might force the southern neighbor to take a position against </p><p>the plan. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>MAOISTS MAY FULMINATE, </p><p>BUT WON\'T QUIT TALKS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  In his most recent telephone conversation with </p><p>Bhattarai a week earlier, Marshall said that the Maoist </p><p>ideologue was "frothing at the mouth" at perceived </p><p>interference by the US, UK, and India in the June 4 change in </p><p>government.  Despite their displeasure at the change in </p><p>government, the Maoists will not break off dialogue, Marshall </p><p>predicted.  He noted the Maoists\' uncharacteristic silence </p><p>after the local press reported that 7 insurgents had been </p><p>killed in a fire fight with the RNA in Jajarkot on June 21 </p><p>(septel), speculating that the Maoists were unwilling to </p><p>jeopardize relations with the new goverment by raising an </p><p>outcry.  When poloff asked why the Maoists were so angry at a </p><p>change that swapped one royally appointed National Democratic </p><p>Party leader for another, Marshall replied that the Maoists </p><p>fear that the new government will renege on commitments made </p><p>by the Chand governent in the two previous rounds.  He cited </p><p>the 5-km restriction on the RNA and an as-yet unfulfilled </p><p>promise to release all Maoist Central Committee members as </p><p>examples.  Bhattarai remains especially incensed at the USG, </p><p>and continually raises the placement of the Maoists on a </p><p>watchlist in the annual terrorism report as evidence of US </p><p>enmity.  The Maoists truly cannot understand the USG refusal </p><p>to "get over" the murders of  two locally employed Embassy </p><p>guards, Marshall said, indicating that the Maoists believe </p><p>that their admission of responsibility and characterization </p><p>of the executions as mistakes should have been sufficient to </p><p>clear the air.  Poloff said that the USG is seeking justice </p><p>for the two slayings, as well as an end to extortion of US </p><p>businesses, and will not "get over" anything until progress </p><p>is demonstrated on these fronts.  Marshall said he </p><p>understands the US view. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>SECRETARIAT SET UP; </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>NOT YET READY TO GO </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  On June 26 emboffs met with Janak Raj Joshi, Joint </p><p>Secretary at the 10-day-old Peace Secretariat, which was set </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>up by Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa as one of his first </p><p>acts in office.  Joshi, who is currently "squatting" at the </p><p>Ministry of Population and Environment, said he is spending </p><p>most of his time now hiring additional staff members and </p><p>securing suitable office space.  Joshi said he meets with the </p><p>two members of the GON\'s newest talk team (Ref A) on a daily </p><p>basis.  He has not, however, yet met with the four </p><p>facilitators who participated in the two previous rounds, nor </p><p>with the six members of the previous GON negotiating team. </p><p>He acknowledged that neither side apparently had kept minutes </p><p>of the two previous sessions, making his own task of picking </p><p>up where the last round ended significantly more difficult. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The terms of reference for the Secretariat task it </p><p>with six areas of responsibility.  First, the Secretariat is </p><p>charged with "implementation" of all decisions made during </p><p>the talks.  Second, it is to provide negotiators with </p><p>"advice, information and documents" related to the conduct of </p><p>the negotiations.  Joshi said that documenting alleged </p><p>violations of the code of conduct would be an example of a </p><p>duty under this rubric.  Third, the Secretariat is </p><p>responsible for "research and development," i.e., hiring </p><p>consultants and experts and/or developing a "road map" for </p><p>the peace process.  Fourth, the Secretariat will document </p><p>each round of negotiations (a marked departure from past </p><p>practice).  Fifth, it is responsible for "generic </p><p>coordination" with NGOs, civil society, and the donor </p><p>community.  Sixth, it will act as the talk team\'s media </p><p>liaison.  (Note:  A wire diagram outlining the Secretariat\'s </p><p>organizational structure has been e-mailed to SA/INS.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Poloff asked about possible Secretariat plans to </p><p>hire consultants and experts.  Joshi emphasized that the GON </p><p>has not yet decided whether to solicit outside assistance, </p><p>adding that any experts or consultants needed might be </p><p>locally hired.  "We have to be careful of outside influence," </p><p>he noted, but added that assistance from a multilateral, </p><p>neutral organization could be more politically acceptable. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) With Prime Minister Thapa still trying to urge </p><p>political parties to join his half-full Cabinet and with only </p><p>two members of a talk team appointed, the GON is unlikely to </p><p>be re-open formal negotiations very soon.  However much the </p><p>Maoists may complain that the change in government is </p><p>delaying progress, the hiatus between rounds of dialogue </p><p>offers a valuable window of opportunity for the GON to </p><p>receive some desperately needed aid in preparing for </p><p>negotiations.  Despite its obvious need, the GON had </p><p>previously parried all offers of negotiation assistance from </p><p>donors eager to assist the peace process with polite refusals </p><p>that usually contained some reference to "regional </p><p>sensitivities" (Nepali-speak for India).  It is difficult to </p><p>determine whether the GON has overcome its reservations and </p><p>decided to accept some quiet, low-profile assistance, or </p><p>whether Information Minister Thapa, who has apparently been </p><p>on cordial terms with Marshall for some time, simply could </p><p>not bring himself to refuse the offer outright.  The Embassy </p><p>will follow up with the resident HD staff member and with </p><p>others in the GON to learn if the government has changed its </p><p>attitude toward third-party assistance in the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
