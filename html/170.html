SUMMARY:  ELEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN PUNJAB </p><p>STATE ON AUGUST 6 IN CONTINUING SECTARIAN STRIFE. </p><p>DELHI POLICE ARE GEARING UP TO MEET THE EXPECTED </p><p>INCREASE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY BEFORE THE INDEPENDENCE </p><p>DAY CELEBRATIONS ON AUGUST 15.  ACTING JATHEDAR </p><p>DARSHAN SINGH RAGI\'S CONVENTION, HELD AUGUST 4, </p><p>PROVIDED A FORUM FOR EXTREME AND MODERATE POINTS OF </p><p>VIEW WITH NO OBVIOUS MEETING OF MINDS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS ELEVEN PEOPLE--NINE OF </p><p>WHOM WERE HINDUS--WERE KILLED IN TERRORIST RELATED </p><p>VIOLENCE IN PUNJAB ON AUGUST 6.  TWO ALLEGED </p><p>TERRORISTS WERE KILLED BY SECURITY FORCES WHO </p><p>RECOVERED A US MADE AUTOMATIC WEAPON FROM ONE OF THE </p><p>BODIES.  ALMOST ALL THE VIOLENT ACTIVITY TOOK PLACE IN </p><p>AMRITSAR DISTRICT.  A COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIA </p><p>ACTIVIST, AND GENERAL SECRETARY OF PARA MEDICAL </p><p>EMPLOYEES, WAS SHOT BY THREE TERRORISTS.  THE KILLERS, </p><p>WHO LEFT A NOTE CLAIMING TO BE FROM THE RANJIT SINGH </p><p>RANA GROUP, ESCAPED ON THE VICTIM\'S SCOOTER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ACCORDING TO NEWSPAPER REPORTS, THE HOME MINISTRY </p><p>"HAS DEFINITE INFORMATION THAT THE EXTREMISTS ARE </p><p>PLOTTING DO SOMETHING VERY IMPRESSIVE" IN THE WEEK </p><p>LEADING UP TO INDEPENDENCE DAY.  OTHER SOURCES REPORT </p><p>THAT THE TERRORISTS WILL PROBABLY STRIKE ON AUGUST 15 </p><p>FOR MAXIMUM ALL-INDIA ATTENTION.  DELHI POLICE, </p><p>REELING FROM THEIR FAILURE TO STOP RECENT TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS IN THE POSH SOUTH DELHI HOUSING COLONIES, ARE </p><p>STEPPING UP THEIR ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL POSSIBLE </p><p>TERRORIST ENTRY TO THE CITY.  ALL ENTRY POINTS TO THE </p><p>CITY ARE NOW GUARDED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THE POLICE </p><p>HAVE REPORTEDLY IMPROVED THEIR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. </p><p>THERE APPEARS TO BE NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>TERRORISTS WOULD NECESSARILY STRIKE IN DELHI, ALTHOUGH </p><p>THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE PUBLICITY THEY DESIRE.  BOTH </p><p>HARYANA AND PUNJAB GOVERNMENTS HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR </p><p>SECURITY MECHANISMS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACTING JATHEDAR DARSHAN SINGH RAGI CONTINUED HIS </p><p>LONE CAMPAIGN FOR A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE </p><p>MILITANTS AND MODERATES WITH A SIKH CONVENTION ON </p><p>AUGUST 4. (SEE REFTEL)  THE CONVENTION WAS A NOISY </p><p>AFFAIR WITH LITTLE CONGRUENCE OF VIEWS BETWEEN THE </p><p>MODERATES AND MILITANTS AND AN ABUNDANCE OF RADICALISM </p><p>ON THE PART OF THE MILITANTS.  ALTHOUGH MANY </p><p>PARTICIPANTS OF THE CONVENTION CLEARLY DEMANDED NO </p><p>LESS THAN KHALISTAN, THE CONVENTION RESOLUTION CALLED </p><p>FOR THE SIKHS TO BE GIVEN AN "AREA AND POLITICAL SETUP </p><p>IN NORTH INDIA WHERE SIKHS CAN EXPERIENCE THE GLOW OF </p><p>FREEDOM."  ACCORDING TO RAGI, THE DEMAND WAS A SPINOFF </p><p>FROM AN ASSURANCE GIVEN TO THE SIKHS BY JAWAHARLAL </p><p>NEHRU IN 1946.  EXPANDING ON THE THEME, THE HIGH </p><p>PRIEST EXPLAINED THAT THE PROPOSED "SET-UP" WOULD </p><p>RESULT IN GREATER AUTONOMY FOR THE STATE.  A SIKH </p><p>CLAIMING TO REPRESENT SIKHS LIVING OUTSIDE PUNJAB SAID </p><p>THAT SIKH DEMANDS REPRESENTED DEMANDS OF ALL INDIAN </p><p>STATES AND URGED THE HIGH PRIESTS TO START A </p><p>NATIONWIDE MOVEMENT IN SUPPORT OF INCREASED AUTONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MODERATE SPEAKERS CALLED FOR A NON-VIOLENT </p><p>STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE THE AIMS OF THE SIKHS AND MOST </p><p>SPEAKERS DEMANDED IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>ANANDAPUR SAHIB RESOLUTION WHICH CALLED FOR GREATER </p><p>AUTONOMY IN THE STATES.  THE MILITANTS, AS WAS </p><p>EXPECTED, DEMANDED THE FORMATION OF KHALISTAN AND </p><p>DECLARED THAT THE GUN WAS THE ONLY ANSWER FOR THE </p><p>SIKHS.  THE MILITANT GROUPS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE </p><p>BABBAR KHALSA, ALL QUESTIONED THE LEADERSHIP OF THE </p><p>HIGH PRIESTS BUT MADE NO MOVES TO REPLACE THEM.  IN </p><p>RAGI\'S CONCLUDING STATEMENT HE AGREED WITH THE </p><p>MILITANTS THAT THEY COULD NOT ACHIEVE THEIR AIMS </p><p>WITHOUT WEAPONS.   BUT, THE HIGH PRIEST NOTED, WEAPONS </p><p>MUST CHANGE WITH THE TIMES AND THE TIMES NO LONGER </p><p>CALLED FOR VIOLENT STRUGGLE.  THE TIME HAD COME, RAGI </p><p>PLEADED, "FOR UNITY BETWEEN THOSE WHO FAVORED THE GUN </p><p>AND THOSE WHO FAVORED NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT." </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE CONVENTION WAS ATTENDED BY SOME FIVE HUNDRED </p><p>PARTICIPANTS ALL OF WHOM PASSED THROUGH STRICT POLICE </p><p>SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE ENTERING THE GOLDEN </p><p>TEMPLE.  MODERATE POLITICIANS, INCLUDING </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AKALI DAL (L), WERE NOT INVITED </p><p>TO ATTEND THE CONVENTION.  PARTICIPANTS DID INCLUDE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE "UNIFIED" AKALI DAL, THE </p><p>BABBAR KHALSA, BOTH THE MANJIT SINGH AND GURJIT SINGH </p><p>FACTIONS OF THE ALL INDIA SIKH STUDENTS FEDERATION, </p><p>THE BHINDRANWALE TIGERS FORCE OF KHALISTAN, THE </p><p>KHALISTAN COMMANDO FORCE, THE KHALISTAN LIBERATION </p><p>FORCE, THE SIKH INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL AND THE DALIT </p><p>FRONT.  INDIVIDUALS LAWYERS, INTELLECTUALS AND RETIRED </p><p>MILITARY ALSO ATTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  THE CONTINUING VIOLENCE AND THE FLAT </p><p>RESULT OF DARSHAN SINGH RAGI\'S ATTEMPTS TO FORGE </p><p>MILITANT-MODERATE UNITY INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO </p><p>IMMEDIATE PROGRESS ON THE SIKH\'S SIDE OF THE PUNJAB </p><p>DILEMMA.  THE SPEECHES AT THE SIKH CONVENTION SHOW THE </p><p>DEEP DIFFERENCES THAT REMAIN BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. </p><p>INDEED, THE FINAL DECLARATION IS AN OBVIOUS ATTEMPT TO </p><p>PAPER OVER THESE DIVISIONS.  DARSHAN SINGH RAGI\'S </p><p>ATTEMPT WAS WELL RECEIVED BY POLITICAL OBSERVERS AND </p><p>THE HIGH PRIEST REMAINS THE BEST HOPE FOR SOME </p><p>SOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STREEB </p><p></p></div>
