(SBU) THE IMF/WORLD BANK ENHANCED STRUCTURAL </p><p>ADJUSTMENT FACILITY (ESAF) AND STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT </p><p>CREDIT (SAC) AGREEMENTS FOR VIETNAM HAVE BEEN </p><p>SUSPENDED FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS DUE TO DISAGREEMENTS </p><p>OVER THE PACE AND EXTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S (GVN) ECONOMIC REFORMS IN THE AREAS OF </p><p>TRADE, STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOE\'S), AND BANKING. </p><p>ON JUNE 7 THE IMF\'S RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE TOLD </p><p>EMBASSY THE GVN RECENTLY URGED THE IMF AND BANK TO </p><p>REDOUBLE EFFORTS TO CONCLUDE THE AGREEMENTS.  A MAJOR </p><p>COMPONENT OF THE REFORM AGENDA WILL BE TO REVAMP </p><p>VIETNAM\'S WEAK, ILL-MANAGED BANKING SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE LATEST DRAFT PLAN BY THE STATE BANK OF </p><p>VIETNAM (SBVN) FOR BANKING REFORM INVOLVES A </p><p>RESTRUCTURING OF ALL VIETNAMESE BANKS, ESPECIALLY THE </p><p>FOUR STATE-OWNED COMMERCIAL BANKS (SOCB\'S) THAT </p><p>DOMINATE THE SECTOR.  IT IS INTENDED TO CREATE A </p><p>`LEVEL PLAYING FIELD\' FOR ALL BANKS, INCLUDING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01299  01 OF 05  140054Z </p><p>SOCB\'S, J-S, AND FOREIGN.  THE MAIN POLICY GOALS ARE </p><p>REMOVAL OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR `POLICY LENDING\' </p><p>FROM THE SOCB\'S, WHICH WILL BE REQUIRED TO OPERATE ON </p><p>A PURELY COMMERCIAL BASIS; RESTRUCTURING OF </p><p>NONPERFORMING LOANS, REPORTEDLY AS MUCH AS 27-28 </p><p>PERCENT OF TOTAL DEBT, THROUGH CREATION OF AN `ASSET </p><p>MANAGEMENT COMPANY\'; AND, ENHANCEMENT OF THE </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES OF THE </p><p>SOCB\'S AND THE SBVN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE SBVN\'S PLAN ALSO AFFECTS OPERATIONS OF THE </p><p>J-S AND FOREIGN BANKS IN VIETNAM.  SOME OF THE J-S </p><p>BANKS WILL BE MERGED AND THE SBVN WILL DEVELOP NEW </p><p>MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING CRITERIA TO ENSURE THEIR </p><p>FINANCIAL HEALTH.  AS PART OF THE GVN\'S OVERALL </p><p>PROCESS OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION IT </p><p>PLANS TO MINIMIZE THE CURRENTLY `LARGE\' NUMBER OF </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN BANK OPERATIONS IN VIETNAM TO </p><p>MOVE TOWARD CREATION OF A `LEVEL PLAYING FIELD\'. </p><p>ONE SBVN OFFICIAL SAID THE GVN MIGHT EVEN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>MAKE THE `DOMESTIC ROADMAP\' FOR REFORM FASTER THAN </p><p>THE SCHEDULE AGREED IN THE UNSIGNED BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p>4. (U) REF A REPORTED RESULTS OF SEPTEMBER 1999 </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN A JOINT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY </p><p>FUND (IMF)/WORLD BANK (WB) TEAM AND THE GVN ON NEW </p><p>ENHANCED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT FACILITY (ESAF) AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01299  01 OF 05  140054Z </p><p>STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT (SAC) AGREEMENTS FOR </p><p>VIETNAM.  BOTH FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN </p><p>SUSPENDED FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS DUE TO DISAGREEMENTS </p><p>OVER THE PACE AND EXTENT OF THE GVN\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORMS.  IN PARTICULAR, THE WB AND IMF HAVE </p><p>TARGETTED THREE AREAS FOR REFORM -- THE TRADE REGIME, </p><p>SOE\'S, AND THE BANKING SYSTEM.  THE SEPTEMBER ROUND </p><p>OF TALKS BROUGHT SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON THE FIRST </p><p>TWO BUT LESS ON THE THIRD.  TWO MORE COMPONENTS OF </p><p>THE AGREEMENTS WILL ADDRESS THE MACROECONOMY AND </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) PERHAPS THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECT OF THE </p><p>REFORM AGENDA CONCERNS VIETNAM\'S WEAK, ILL-MANAGED </p><p>BANKING SYSTEM.  WORLD BANK PRESIDENT JAMES </p><p>WOLFENSOHN RAISED THIS ISSUE WITH HIS SBVN </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS AND OTHER HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS DURING </p><p>HIS FEBRUARY 21-24 VISIT TO VIETNAM.  HE WAS QUOTED </p><p>IN THE PRESS AS SAYING `IF YOU HAVE STATE-OWNED BANKS </p><p>LENDING TO STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES, YOU DON\'T </p><p>TYPICALLY GET VERY GOOD REPAYMENTS.\'  SBVN GOVERNOR </p><p>LE DUC THUY RESPONDED THAT `VIETNAM SHARES ... THESE </p><p>CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES\'. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) ON FEBRUARY 28, THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S DAILY </p><p>NEWSPAPER `NHAN DAN\' (THE PEOPLE), IN A REMARKABLY </p><p>CRITICAL EDITORIAL ENTITLED `LET\'S RESTORE ORDER AND </p><p>RENOVATE THE BANKING SYSTEM\' (REF B), CHARACTERIZED </p><p>VIETNAM\'S FINANCIAL AND BANKING SYSTEM AS `FULL OF </p><p>WEAKNESSES AND DISCREPANCIES\'.  IT SAID `URGENT </p><p>MEASURES\' WERE REQUIRED TO RENOVATE THE SYSTEM AND </p><p>PREVENT `MORAL DEGENERATION\' OF BANKING PERSONNEL. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>REFORM PLAN </p><p>----------- </p><p>7. (SBU) ON JUNE 7 THE IMF\'S RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>TOLD EMBASSY THE GVN, IN PARTICULAR DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG, WAS URGING THE IMF AND </p><p>WORLD BANK TO ACCELERATE THEIR NEGOTIATIONS AND </p><p>CONCLUDE THE LONG-STALLED AGREEMENTS.  HE HOPED TO </p><p>HAVE MORE DETAILS OF THE GVN\'S PLANS BY JUNE 9, BUT </p><p>THE FINAL FORM OF THE PROGRAM PROBABLY WILL REQUIRE </p><p>SOME ADDITIONAL NEGOTIATION.  EMBASSY HAS NOT YET </p><p>SEEN THE GVN\'S LATEST PROPOSAL, BUT BASED ON RECENT </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH DIRECTOR XUAN NGHIA LE OF THE </p><p>BANKING STRATEGY DEPARTMENT AND OTHER SBVN OFFICIALS </p><p>WE BELIEVE IT WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01299  02 OF 05  140054Z </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) THE PLAN WOULD INVOLVE A RESTRUCTURING OF ALL </p><p>VIETNAMESE BANKS, ESPECIALLY THE FOUR SOCB\'S THAT </p><p>DOMINATE THE SECTOR.  IT IS INTENDED TO CREATE A </p><p>`LEVEL PLAYING FIELD\' FOR ALL BANKS, INCLUDING STATE- </p><p>OWNED, J-S, AND FOREIGN.  THIS, SAID MR. LE, WAS THE </p><p>ONLY WAY TO ENSURE A SOUND AND SAFE BANKING SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>SEPARATE "POLICY LENDING" </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>9. (U) THE SBVN PLAN INCLUDES FOUR MAIN POLICY GOALS. </p><p>FIRST, RESPONSIBILITY FOR `POLICY LENDING\' SHALL BE </p><p>REMOVED FROM THE SOCB\'S, WHICH WILL BE REQUIRED TO </p><p>OPERATE ON A PURELY COMMERCIAL BASIS.  THE TASK OF </p><p>POLICY LENDING WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO A NEW AND </p><p>SEPARATE AGENCY, SUPERVISED BY THE SBVN.  DIRECTOR LE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THIS POLICY LENDING WOULD INCLUDE LOANS </p><p>FOR STUDENTS, POOR PEOPLE, AND VICTIMS OF NATURAL </p><p>DISASTERS, RATHER THAN COMMERCIALLY UNSOUND LOANS TO </p><p>SOE\'S. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) LE SAID `IN PRINCIPLE\' THE SOE\'S WOULD HAVE </p><p>TO BORROW FROM BANKS ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS.  IN THE </p><p>PAST THE GVN HAS CHANNELLED STATE FUNDS THROUGH THE </p><p>SOCB\'S TO SELECTED SOE\'S TO INCREASE THEIR PRODUCTIVE </p><p>CAPACITY.  TO REPLACE THIS MECHANISM, THE NEW PLAN </p><p>WOULD PROVIDE FOR AN `INVESTMENT ASSISTANCE FUND\' </p><p>COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THE BANKING SYSTEM.  THIS FUND </p><p>ALSO WOULD BE USED FOR WORLD BANK AND ASIAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECTS CO-FUNDED BY THE GVN. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01299  02 OF 05  140054Z </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>BAD BANK DEBT </p><p>------------- </p><p>11. (U) THE SECOND POLICY GOAL IS TO RESTRUCTURE </p><p>NONPERFORMING LOANS EXTENDED BY THE SOCB\'S WITHIN A </p><p>RELATIVELY SHORT TIME.  ALTHOUGH SBVN AND MINISTRY OF </p><p>FINANCE OFFICIALS REPEATEDLY HAVE REFUSED TO DIVULGE </p><p>THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT IN VIETNAM\'S BANKING </p><p>SYSTEM, ON FEBRUARY 17 THE VIETNAMESE PRESS REPORTED </p><p>TOTAL BAD DEBT HAS REACHED 9.92 TRILLION DONG (U.S. </p><p>$708 MILLION), EQUIVALENT TO 27-28 PERCENT OF TOTAL </p><p>DEBT.  SEVERAL FOREIGN BANKERS, HOWEVER, ESTIMATE THE </p><p>ACTUAL AMOUNT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) BECAUSE THIS ISSUE IS INTERCONNECTED WITH THE </p><p>PROBLEM OF SOE BAD DEBT, THE GVN INTENDS TO CREATE AN </p><p>`ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY\' (AMC), SUBORDINATE TO THE </p><p>SBVN BUT FUNDED FROM THE STATE BUDGET, TO PURCHASE </p><p>SOE AND OTHER CORPORATE DEBT.  THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO </p><p>INSURE THE SOCB\'S BECOME FINANCIALLY HEALTHY AS SOON </p><p>AS POSSIBLE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME EXPEDITE </p><p>LIQUIDATION OF COLLATERAL ASSETS OF CORPORATE </p><p>BORROWERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) LE EXPECTED THE AMC TO BEGIN OPERATIONS LATER </p><p>IN 2000 AND CONTINUE FOR UP TO 5-7 YEARS, OR UNTIL </p><p>THE BAD DEBT PROBLEM IS SOLVED.  WHILE UNWILLING TO </p><p>SAY HOW MUCH BAD DEBT WAS ON THE BOOKS, LE SUGGESTED </p><p>THE AMC\'S INITIAL BUDGET WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT TO </p><p>PURCHASE ALL OF IT.  INSTEAD, THEY WOULD CHOOSE THE </p><p>MOST URGENT COMPANIES FOR THE FIRST TRANCHE OF THEIR </p><p>OPERATIONS.  HE SAID IF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE TOTAL SOCB </p><p>BAD DEBT WAS ONE BILLION DOLLARS, THEN AMC\'S LIKELY </p><p>BUDGET WOULD BE ABOUT 300 MILLION, WHICH OBVIOUSLY </p><p>WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PURCHASE ALL THE </p><p>COLLATERAL AT ITS ORIGINAL VALUE. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) LE CLAIMED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY APPROVAL FOR </p><p>CREATION OF THE AMC IS NOT REQUIRED, ALTHOUGH SOME OF </p><p>ITS OPERATIONS MIGHT BE LIMITED IF THEY CONTRADICTED </p><p>ANY EXISTING LEGISLATION, SUCH AS THE LAND LAW OR THE </p><p>ENTERPRISE LAW.  HE SAID THERE ALSO MAY BE LEGAL </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON DISCLOSURE AND LIQUIDIZATION OF </p><p>COLLATERAL.  IF, FOR EXAMPLE, AN ITEM OF COLLATERAL </p><p>INITIALLY WAS VALUED AT ONE BILLION DONG, THEN WAS </p><p>ACQUIRED BY THE AMC AND SOLD FOR JUST 500 MILLION, </p><p>UNDER VIETNAMESE LAW `SOMEONE\' WOULD HAVE TO BE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01299  03 OF 05  140055Z </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS.  DIRECTOR LE SAID THE GVN </p><p>WAS `FRIGHTENED\' BY THIS POSSIBILITY, AS THE SOCB\'S </p><p>WOULD BE AFRAID TO SELL COLLATERAL ASSETS TO THE AMC </p><p>IF THEY MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) THE NON-PERFORMING LOANS FROM THE SOCB\'S </p><p>WOULD BE RESTRUCTURED IN THREE WAYS.  FIRST, A </p><p>CERTAIN AMOUNT SIMPLY WOULD BE WRITTEN OFF, ALTHOUGH </p><p>BUDGETARY CONTRAINTS WOULD REQUIRE THIS PROPORTION TO </p><p>BE RELATIVELY SMALL.  FURTHER, LE SAID THIS INABILITY </p><p>TO WRITE OFF AS MUCH OF THE DEBT AS NEEDED MAY LEAD </p><p>TO MORE BAD DEBT IN THE FUTURE AND TO CONTINUING </p><p>FINANCIAL ILL HEALTH FOR THE SOCB\'S, BUT THE GVN HAD </p><p>NO CHOICE.  SECOND, A SOMEWHAT LARGER PROPORTION OF </p><p>THE DEBT WOULD BE RESCHEDULED AND/OR RESTRUCTURED. </p><p>FINALLY, THE GVN WILL REPAY SOME OF THE LOANS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH LE WOULD NOT SAY HOW MUCH. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) IN A RELATED MOVE TO PROTECT BANK DEPOSITORS </p><p>FROM RISK, AND THEREBY ENTICE MORE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE </p><p>TO KEEP THEIR SAVINGS IN BANKS RATHER THAN GOLD OR </p><p>DOLLARS, THE SBVN ANNOUNCED INAUGURATION OF A </p><p>`DEPOSIT INSURANCE ORGANIZATION\' (DIO).  THE DIO WILL </p><p>BE RESPONSIBLE FOR INSURING DEPOSITS UP TO 30 MILLION </p><p>DONG (USD 2,100).  ALL COMMERCIAL BANKS AND CREDIT </p><p>INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO JOIN THE PROGRAM AND </p><p>PAY THE INSURANCE PREMIUM, REPORTEDLY TO BE SET AT </p><p>0.15 PERCENT OF THE DEPOSIT VALUE.  SOME OF THE </p><p>LARGER SOCB\'S BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE RISKIER </p><p>(JOINT-STOCK) BANKS SHOULD PAY A HIGHER PREMIUM. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01299  03 OF 05  140055Z </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>TIGHTEN UP THE SYSTEM </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>17. (U) THE THIRD AND FOURTH POLICY GOALS OF THE NEW </p><p>REFORMS ARE TO ENHANCE THE INSTITUTIONAL AND </p><p>MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES OF THE SOCB\'S AND TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE SUPERVISORY FUNCTIONS OF THE SBVN OVER </p><p>THE SOCB\'S.  LE SAID THE SBVN ALREADY HAD RECEIVED </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THIS FROM THE WORLD BANK, </p><p>IMF, ADB, AND SOME BILATERAL DONORS, BUT NEEDED MORE. </p><p>HE CLAIMED THERE HAD NOT BEEN MUCH PROGRESS IN THIS </p><p>AREA BECAUSE THE `CONCEPTIONS\' OF THE DONORS WERE </p><p>`NOT SATISFACTORY\'.  IN PARTICULAR, SOME OF THE </p><p>SOCB\'S WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY MEETING REQUIREMENTS </p><p>SET BY THE WORLD BANK FOR EACH SOCB TO FORMULATE ITS </p><p>OWN STRATEGY TO MEET INTERNATIONAL CRITERIA.  THIS, </p><p>HE SAID, WAS SIMPLY BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE </p><p>SOCB\'S.  IT ALSO WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE SBVN ITSELF TO </p><p>EVALUATE THE SOCB PROPOSALS BECAUSE THE SOCB\'S WOULD </p><p>NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENTLY TRANSPARENT INFORMATION ON </p><p>THEIR OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) THE PLAN ALSO REPORTEDLY INCLUDES A PROPOSAL </p><p>FOR A PILOT SOCB RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM FOR THE </p><p>AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK AND THE BANK </p><p>OF FOREIGN TRADE.  IT WILL INVOLVE RESTRUCTURING AND </p><p>IMPROVING THEIR FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS, </p><p>DEBT, PERSONNEL, AND STRATEGY.  THE SBVN HOPES THEY </p><p>CAN BE UPGRADED TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>JOINT STOCK BANKS </p><p>----------------- </p><p>19. (U) IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE FOUR POLICY GOALS, </p><p>THE SBVN\'S REFORM PLAN ALSO CONTAINS PROVISIONS </p><p>AFFECTING OPERATIONS OF THE JOINT STOCK (J-S) AND </p><p>FOREIGN BANKS IN VIETNAM.  SOME OF THE 48 J-S BANKS </p><p>CURRENTLY OPERATING IN VIETNAM, PARTICULARLY THE </p><p>SMALLER ONES, WILL BE MERGED, WHILE IN GENERAL THE </p><p>SBVN WILL TRY TO INCREASE BOTH THE NUMBER OF </p><p>SHAREHOLDERS AND THE AMOUNT OF REGISTERED CAPITAL. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, THE SBVN WILL DEVELOP NEW CRITERIA TO </p><p>ENSURE THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE J-S BANKS.  THESE </p><p>CRITERIA WOULD FOCUS ON `MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY\' OF </p><p>THE BANKS AND ALSO INCLUDE STRICTER REQUIREMENTS FOR </p><p>SUPERVISION, INSPECTION, AND REPORTING.  THE SBVN </p><p>WILL ASSIST THE BANKS TO RESTRUCTURE THEIR ASSETS AND </p><p>LIABILITIES BASED ON RISK ASSESSMENT. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01299  04 OF 05  140055Z </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) ACCORDING TO DIRECTOR LE, MANY OF THE J-S </p><p>BANKS ARE `RELUCTANT\' TO MERGE AND THEREFORE THE SBVN </p><p>WILL HAVE TO INTERVENE IN THE MERGER AND ACQUISITION </p><p>PROCESS.  HE SAID A NUMBER OF THEM ALREADY HAD BEEN </p><p>MERGED OR DISSOLVED, AND NONE HAD FAILED.  THEIR </p><p>MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY, HOWEVER, REMAINED A MAJOR </p><p>WEAKNESS, AND THE SBVN WILL PROVIDE TRAINING IN THIS </p><p>AREA.  LE ALSO HOPED SOME J-S BANKS WOULD FORM JOINT </p><p>VENTURES WITH FOREIGN BANKS, WHICH COULD TRANSFER </p><p>MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>FOREIGN BANKS </p><p>------------- </p><p>21. (U) ACCORDING TO LE, AS PART OF THE GVN\'S OVERALL </p><p>PROCESS OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION IT </p><p>PLANS TO MINIMIZE THE CURRENTLY `LARGE\' NUMBER OF </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN BANK OPERATIONS IN VIETNAM. </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, HE SAID THE SBVN WOULD REDUCE </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON MANAGEMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES </p><p>IN LOCAL CURRENCY AND ON ABILITY OF FOREIGN BANKS TO </p><p>ACCEPT DEPOSITS IN LOCAL CURRENCY.  THIS, HE SAID, </p><p>WAS A PRECONDITION FOR CREATION OF A `LEVEL PLAYING </p><p>FIELD\'. </p><p> </p><p>22. (U) FURTHERMORE, LE SAID THE SBVN WOULD PROPOSE </p><p>TO PHASE OUT LIMITS ON FOREIGN BANK EQUITY SHARES AND </p><p>THEIR PERCENTAGE SHARES IN JOINT VENTURES WITH </p><p>VIETNAMESE BANKS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SCHEDULE </p><p>AGREED IN PRINCIPLE UNDER THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01299  04 OF 05  140055Z </p><p>AGREEMENT.  HE SAID THE SBVN WOULD ATTEMPT TO MAKE </p><p>THE `DOMESTIC ROADMAP\' FOR REFORM FASTER THAN THE </p><p>SCHEDULE AGREED IN THE BTA, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS </p><p>`REALISTIC\' BUT IMPROVEABLE.  HE ADDED THAT VIETNAM </p><p>ALREADY HAD AGREED TO A BANKING REFORM TIMETABLE FOR </p><p>THE ASEAN FREE TRADE AREA (AFTA) THAT WAS BOTH FASTER </p><p>AND STRONGER THAN PROPOSED COMMITMENTS TO THE U.S. </p><p>AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION.  FOR AFTA, VIETNAM </p><p>WOULD BEGIN TO OPEN ITS BANKING SECTOR BY THE YEAR </p><p>2006 AND COMPLETE THE PROCESS BY 2010, BUT HE </p><p>BELIEVED THE MORE DEVELOPED ASEAN MEMBERS HAD </p><p>PROPOSED THAT VIETNAM, MYANMAR, AND LAOS SHOULD </p><p>ACCELERATE THIS PROCESS.  LE ALSO SAID THE SBVN WAS </p><p>CONSIDERING EQUITIZATION (PARTIAL PRIVATIZATION) OF </p><p>ONE OF THE STATE-OWNED COMMERCIAL BANKS, AND FOREIGN </p><p>BANKS MAY BE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>23. (SBU) REFORM OF VIETNAM\'S BANKING SYSTEM CANNOT </p><p>SUCCEED WITHOUT A SIMULTANEOUS AND SEVERE ASSAULT ON </p><p>THE STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES, A FORMIDABLE OBSTACLE, </p><p>AND PROBABLY NOT WITHOUT MAJOR LIBERALIZATION OF THE </p><p>TRADE REGIME.  THIS IS WHY THE WORLD BANK AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HAVE LINKED THE THREE </p><p>ISSUES, AND ALSO WHY WE TARGETTED ALL THREE IN THE </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. YET WHILE </p><p>THIS IS TRUE, IT IS ALSO CRITICAL THAT VIETNAM BEGIN </p><p>THE PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. </p><p>THE TIME FOR PLANNING IS OVER, IT\'S NOW TIME TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>24.  (SBU) THIS CABLE INDICATES THERE ARE A NUMBER OF </p><p>OPTIMISTIC SIGNS THAT CHANGE IS IN THE AIR, </p><p>PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO BANKING AND FINANCIAL </p><p>SECTOR REFORM.  MOREOVER, THE HANOI-BASED IMF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE CONSIDERS THAT VIETNAM MAY NOW BE </p><p>CONSOLIDATING THE POLITICAL WILL NEEDED TO MOVE </p><p>FORWARD ON A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING EFFORT ALONG THE </p><p>LINES PROPOSED BY THE WORLD BANK AND THE IMF. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE, LIKE EMBASSY OFFICERS, REMAINS PERPLEXED </p><p>WHY VIETNAM WOULD CHOOSE THE PRESENT TIME TO PROCEED. </p><p>THIS IS A PERIOD OF POLITICAL INTROSPECTION, AS THE </p><p>PARTY PREPARES FOR THE WATERSHED EVENT OF ANOTHER </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001, NOT AN </p><p>IDEAL TIME TO TAKE RADICAL DECISIONS WHICH CAN </p><p>GENERATE CRITICISM.  MOREOVER, IT IS AGAINST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01299  05 OF 05  140055Z </p><p>VIETNAMESE CHARACTER TO UNDERTAKE BOLD MOVES UNLESS </p><p>THEY FEEL BACKED INTO A CORNER.  THEY ARE NOT.  WHILE </p><p>NEW FDI COMMITMENTS CONTINUE ON A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND </p><p>EMPLOYMENT GENERATION IS NEGLIGIBLE, MANY GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE PLEASED WITH RECENT ECONOMIC DATA: </p><p>GROWTH (SIX PERCENT FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR), </p><p>EXPORTS (ROBUST) AND INFLATION (NONE).  THE ECONOMY </p><p>IS IN MANY WAYS IMPROVING ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE </p><p>ASIAN REGION. REGARDLESS OF THE REASONS WHY THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE MAY MOVE NOW, IF BANKING AND FINANCIAL </p><p>SECTOR REFORM PROCEEDS, IT WOULD GIVE FURTHER LIFT TO </p><p>THE ECONOMY.  WE HOPE THIS HAPPENS SOON. </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
