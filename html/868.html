<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ALGIERS 000734 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  1/24/2007 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, KISL, AG </p><p>SUBJECT:  ALGERIA\'S HAMAS PARTY:  A WINNING ORGANIZATION? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ALGIERS 437 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN, </p><p>AMEMBASSY ALGIERS, REASON 1.5 D. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE FOCUS </p><p>IN ISLAMIST POLITICS HERE HAS SHIFTED TO THE LEGAL </p><p>ISLAMIC PARTY HAMAS (N0 RELATION TO PALESTINIAN </p><p>HAMAS) AWAY FROM THE BANNED ISLAMIC SALVATI0N FRONT </p><p>(FIS).  S0ME 0BSERVERS SUGGEST THAT WERE THE FIS </p><p>ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THE SCENE, THE POPULAR BASE OF </p><p>HAMAS WOULD VANISH (WE ARE SKEPTICAL).  HAMAS\' </p><p>LEADER, MAHFOUD NAHNAH IS NOT AS GIFTED AN ORATOR AS </p><p>SOME FIS LEADERS, AND HIS GRADUALIST APPROACH TO </p><p>GAINING P0WER DIMINISHES HIS APPEAL AMONG HARDER </p><p>LINE ISLAMISTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SUMMARY CONTINUED:  THE FIS, HOWEVER, NO LONGER </p><p>EXISTS AS AN ORGANIZATI0N IN ALGERIA WHILE HAMAS HAS </p><p>A RECENT NATIONAL 0RGANIZATION WITH EXPERIENCE FROM </p><p>TW0 NATI0NAL ELECTI0NS BEHIND IT.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>HAMAS HAS CL0SE TIES T0 NON-POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS </p><p>AND CHARITY 0RGANIZATI0NS.  THE NEW GOVERNMENT LAW </p><p>REGULATING PARTIES MAY LIMIT HAMAS\' LINKS WITH </p><p>SUCH GROUPS.  STILL, HAMAS\' BIGGEST ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>WEAKNESS SEEMS TO BE NAHNAH\'S DOMINATION OF THE </p><p>PARTY.  WERE HE SUDDENLY TO DEPART THE SCENE, A </p><p>POWER VACUUM AT THE T0P COULD SERIOUSLY DISRUPT </p><p>HAMAS--UNLIKE THE FIS IN 1991 WHEN ITS TOP </p><p>LEADERSHIP WAS ARRESTED, BUT THE FIS WENT 0N TO WIN </p><p>NATIONAL ELECTIONS NONETHELESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>COMPETITION BETWEEN THE FIS AND HAMAS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  HAMAS HAS GAINED PRESTIGE, AND VOTER </p><p>STRENGTH, SINCE THE ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT WAS </p><p>BANNED IN 1992, BUT SOME THINK HAMAS WOULD DISAPPEAR </p><p>IF THE FIS WERE ALLOWED T0 RETURN.  DEDICATED FIS </p><p>SYMPATHIZERS BLAME HAMAS PRESIDENT MAHFOUD NAHNAH </p><p>FOR HAVING SPLIT THE ALGERIAN ISLAMIST MOVEMENT IN </p><p>1990 (BY SETTING UP HAMAS).  IN ADDITION, </p><p>HARDER-LINE ISLAMISTS REJECT NAHNAH\'S GRADUALIST </p><p>APPROACH TO GAINING POWER; THEY ALSO ACCUSE NAHNAH </p><p>OF COLLABORATING WITH THE G0VERNMENT (IN A WIDELY </p><p>WATCHED FEBRUARY 21 MBC TELEVISION BROADCAST, A </p><p>CALLER FR0M L0ND0N LABELLED NAHNAH A GOVERNMENT </p><p>\'AGENT.\')  MORE0VER, NAHNAH HIMSELF DOES NOT HAVE </p><p>THE CHARISMA 0F SOME FIS 0FFICIALS, NOTABLY JAILED </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT ALI BENHADJ. </p><p> </p><p>INSIDE THE PARTY STRUCTURE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  SHEIKH NAHNAH AND HIS HAMAS PARTY CARRY </p><p>SOME BAGGAGE, BUT THEY HAVE A RELATIVELY ORDERLY </p><p>PARTY WITH PARTICULAR STRENGTHS.  SHEIKH NAHNAH </p><p>DOMINATES A PARTY VERY MUCH HIS CREATION; THERE IS </p><p>LITTLE OF THE DISORDER SO APPARENT INSIDE THE FIS IN </p><p>THE EARLY 1990\'S.  NAHNAH IS THE HEAD OF THE PARTY\'S </p><p>"EXECUTIVE C0UNCIL," (IN ARABIC, MAJLES ET-TANFITH), </p><p>J0INED THERE BY NINE STAFFERS.  THOSE AIDES FOCUS ON </p><p>DISTINCT FUNCTI0NS SUCH AS MEDIA RELATIONS, </p><p>LEGISLATIVE WORK (HAMAS HAS FIVE MEMBERS IN THE </p><p>SURROGATE PARLIAMENT), ISSUES DEVEL0PMENT AND </p><p>INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION.  MOST MAJOR POLICY ISSUES </p><p>ARE DEBATED WITHIN THIS "EXECUTIVE COUNCIL."  A </p><p>"CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL" (MAJLES ESH-SHOURA) SETS </p><p>BROADER GUIDANCE, BUT ITS 100 PLUS MEMBERS, WHO COME </p><p>FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, MEET IRREGULARLY. </p><p> </p><p>WHICH MAINTAINS A MONOLITHIC FACE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  NOTABLY, HAMAS MAINTAINS ENOUGH ORDER </p><p>WITHIN ITS SENIOR RANKS TO GUARD MANY SECRETS.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, VERY LITTLE OF THE INTERNAL DEBATE INSIDE </p><p>THE EXECUTIVE C0UNCIL FILTERS OUTSIDE.  REPORTERS </p><p>FROM THE ARABIC-LANGUAGE DAILIES EL-ALEM ES-SIYASI </p><p>AND EL-KHABER, WHICH CARRY THE BEST REPORTING ON </p><p>ISLAMISTS HERE, C0NFESS T0 HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTY </p><p>PUSHING THEIR HAMAS SOURCES PAST THE OFFICIAL LINE </p><p>T0 DESCRIBE DEBATES INSIDE THE PARTY.  ITS OFFICIALS </p><p>ARE SIMILARLY RETICENT WITH US. </p><p> </p><p>NOT ALL READILY AGREED INSIDE THE MACHINE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  WHILE KEPT QUIET, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME HOT </p><p>POLITICAL ARGUMENTS INSIDE HAMAS.  NAHNAH\'S DECISION </p><p>IN 1995 TO RUN F0R PRESIDENT WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>GUIDELINES PROMPTED TWO HAMAS MAJLES ASH-SHOURA </p><p>MEMBERS TO QUIT THE PARTY.  ONE 0F THEM TOLD POLOFF </p><p>FEBRUARY 23 THAT THE ARGUMENT INSIDE THE MAJLES </p><p>F0CUSSED ON WHETHER HAMAS WAS HELPING THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>BY JOINING THE 1995 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.  NAHNAH </p><p>AND HIS ALLIES IN THE COUNCIL REPORTEDLY ARGUED THAT </p><p>HAMAS COULD GAIN CONFIDENCE OF SENIOR GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS, AND PERHAPS EVEN SOME GOVERNMENT P0STS, </p><p>IF THEY PLAYED THE PRESIDENCY\'S GAME. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER DISPUTES AS WELL. </p><p>F0R EXAMPLE, ACCORDING T0 THE LOCAL PRESS AND 0NE </p><p>HAMAS OFFICIAL, THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL\'S DECISION </p><p>LAST NOVEMBER NOT TO URGE ALGERIANS TO VOTE AGAINST </p><p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS, WHICH INCLUDED </p><p>STRICTURES AGAINST MIXING RELIGION AND POLITICS, </p><p>ALSO STIRRED CONTROVERSY.  SIMILARLY, ALGERIAN </p><p>NEWSPAPERS THIS WEEK HAVE REPORTED THAT SOME IN THE </p><p>HAMAS LEADERSHIP REJECT DELETING ISLAMIC REFERENCES </p><p>FROM HAMAS\' NAME (HAMAS IS AN ACRONYM F0R \'MOVEMENT </p><p>FOR AN ISLAMIC SOCIETY\') IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE </p><p>NEW POLITICAL PARTY LAW.  THE PRESS HAS SPECULATED </p><p>THAT WITH NAHNAH OUTSIDE OF ALGERIA--HE TRAVELS </p><p>ABROAD FREQUENTLY--INTERNAL DEBATES INSIDE THE PARTY </p><p>ARE DIFFICULT T0 SETTLE.  PUBLICLY, H0WEVER, HAMAS </p><p>USUALLY PRESENTS A SINGLE PARTY LINE WHICH CONTRASTS </p><p>TO THE SHARP PUBLIC DISCORD IN THE NATIONAL </p><p>LIBERATION FR0NT AND THE SOCIALIST FORCES FRONT, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE. </p><p> </p><p>A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  HAMAS HAS A NATI0NAL POLITICAL 0RGANIZATION </p><p>THE ENVY 0F M0ST 0THER ALGERIAN POLITICAL PARTIES. </p><p>OUTSIDE ALGIERS, IT HAS 0FFICES WORKING THE STREETS </p><p>0F NEARLY ALL 0F ALGERIA\'S 48 STATES (IN ALGERIAN </p><p>VERNACULAR, WILAYAS), ACCORDING T0 BOTH PARTY </p><p>OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL JOURNALISTS.  A SENIOR HAMAS </p><p>OFFICIAL TOLD P0LOFF RECENTLY THAT THE PARTY </p><p>STRUCTURE REACHES EVEN THE COUNTY LEVEL (DAIRA) IN </p><p>SOME WILAYAS.  THE ORGANIZATION ALSO HAS THE </p><p>EXPERIENCE OF TWO NATIONAL POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS, </p><p>THOSE OF 1991 AND 1995, BEHIND IT.  IN THE LAST SIX </p><p>MONTHS, HAMAS HAS STARTED TUNING ITS WILAYA ENGINES </p><p>AGAIN WITH MEETINGS CRISS-CROSSING ALGERIA. </p><p>N0TABLY, HAMAS IS WORKING WESTERN ALGERIA, OFTEN THE </p><p>ORPHAN OF ALGERIAN POLITICS.  (COMMENT:  OFFICIAL </p><p>FIGURES STATED THAT NAHNAH WON 40 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>VOTES IN 0RAN, ALGERIA\'S SECOND LARGEST WILAYA IN </p><p>1995.  PRIVATELY, THE SHEIKH\'S AIDES SAY THEY </p><p>CAPTURED ABOUT 50 PERCENT, AND WON CLEAR MAJORITIES </p><p>IN SOME ORAN DAIRAS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS WOMEN\'S GROUP </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE HAMAS </p><p>ORGANIZATION IS ITS SPECIAL SECTION OF WOMEN </p><p>ACTIVISTS, DIRECTED BY A WOMAN FROM THE BERBER </p><p>KABYLIE REGION, MALIKA CHABANI.  CHABANI DIRECTS </p><p>BRANCHES IN MOST MAJOR ALGERIAN CITIES.  THESE </p><p>GROUPS UNDERTAKE COMMUNITY PROJECTS, RANGING FROM </p><p>TEACHING SEWING AND KNITTING TO LITERACY COURSES. </p><p>POLITICAL OBSERVERS HERE IN 1995 TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>HAMAS WOMEN ACTIVISTS WERE ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE IN </p><p>DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGNING, TARGETING WOMEN IN </p><p>LOWER-INCOME DISTRICTS IN AN UNMATCHED STYLE OF </p><p>DIRECT POLITICS.  A JOURNALIST WHO HAS STUDIED THESE </p><p>GROUPS TOLD POLOFF IN FEBRUARY THAT THEY HAVE </p><p>REDUCED THEIR ACTIVITIES IN RECENT MONTHS IN ORDER </p><p>TO MAINTAIN A LOWER PROFILE WITH SUSPICIOUS </p><p>GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>AND ALLIES IN ASSOCIATIONS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  HAMAS ALSO RECEIVES HELP FROM TWO </p><p>OFFICIALLY NON-POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS.  THE NATIONAL </p><p>CHARITY ASSOCIATION, "EL-ISLAH WEL-IRSHAD" (\'REFORM </p><p>AND GUIDANCE\') WAS ESTABLISHED BY NAHNAH IN THE MID </p><p>1980\'S BEFORE ISLAMIST PARTIES WERE LEGAL.  ONE </p><p>RESEARCHER TOLD US HAMAS IS VIRTUALLY </p><p>INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE CHARITY GROUP, AS THEIR </p><p>NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEADERSHIPS ARE NEARLY </p><p>IDENTICAL.  EL-ISLAH DONATES FOOD AND CLOTHING TO </p><p>THE POOR, AND HAS AN ACTIVE RAMADAN MEAL PROGRAM. </p><p>IT ALSO WORKS WITH HOME-BASED INDUSTRY PROJECTS WITH </p><p>ALGERIAN W0MEN.  ACCORDING TO JOURNALISTS, SOME OF </p><p>ITS MEMBERS OPERATE OPENLY FROM PARTICULAR MOSQUES </p><p>IN WILAYAS SUCH AS ALGIERS AND BLIDA (NAHNAH\'S </p><p>HOMET0WN).  DURING THE 1995 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, </p><p>MANY EL-ISLAH ACTIVISTS UNDERTOOK DOOR-TO-DOOR </p><p>CAMPAIGNING 0N BEHALF OF CANDIDATE NAHNAH, ACCORDING </p><p>T0 JOURNALISTS AND POLITICAL PARTY SOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  SIMILARLY, THE GENERAL UNI0N 0F FREE </p><p>STUDENTS (UGEL), ACTIVE ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES, ALSO </p><p>HAS CLOSE LINKS TO THE HAMAS PARTY, ACCORDING TO A </p><p>VARIETY 0F SOURCES.  TWO UGEL LEADERS TOLD US </p><p>FEBRUARY 5 THAT THE UNION HAS 46,000 MEMBERS.  THE </p><p>UGEL\'S MAIN WORK IS ON STUDENT ISSUES, SUCH AS </p><p>CAMPUS H0USING AND TRANSPORT.  THE UGEL 0FFICIALS </p><p>SAID SOME MEMBERS SUPPORT NON-ISLAMIST PARTIES, BUT </p><p>THEY RECOGNIZED THE UGEL\'S PREVI0US SUPPORT FOR </p><p>HAMAS.  DURING THE 1995 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, MANY </p><p>UGEL MEMBERS CAMPAIGNED ACTIVELY FOR NAHNAH, </p><p>ACCORDING TO J0URNALISTS AND POLITICAL PARTY SOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  THE PRESIDENT OF BLIDA UNIVERSITY TOLD </p><p>POLOFF IN DECEMBER THAT THE UGEL IS BY FAR THE MOST </p><p>ACTIVE 0F THE STUDENT GROUPS ON HIS CAMPUS; HE </p><p>ESTIMATED THE BLIDA CHAPTER HAD "SEVERAL HUNDRED" </p><p>MEMBERS 0N A CAMPUS 0F 17,000 STUDENTS.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT ALLEGED THAT THE UGEL CHAPTER\'S FUNDING </p><p>COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE HAMAS PARTY.  THE UGEL </p><p>LEADERS SAID 0NLY THAT FUNDING C0MES FROM A VARIETY </p><p>OF L0CAL S0URCES; THEY WOULD NOT CONFIRM THAT HAMAS </p><p>PROVIDES FINANCING. </p><p> </p><p>IN SOME MOSQUES TOO </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  P0LITICAL PARTY AND JOURNALIST SOURCES </p><p>ALS0 ALLEGE THAT HAMAS HAS A NETWORK OF SUPPORT </p><p>AMONG VARIOUS MOSQUES.  0NE INFORMED REPORTER </p><p>CLAIMED THAT A MEMBER OF HAMAS\' MAJLIS ASH-SHURA </p><p>GIVES THE FRIDAY SERMON MOST WEEKS AT THE MAIN </p><p>MOSQUE IN THE ALGIERS DISTRICT 0F BACHDJARRAH (WHERE </p><p>THIS SOURCE LIVES).  AN ISLAMIST DOCTOR WITH FAMILY </p><p>IN THE LARBA, OUTSIDE ALGIERS, CLAIMS THAT THE IMAM </p><p>AT THE MAIN MOSQUE IN LARBA IS A HAMAS ACTIVIST; THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS HIM IN ORDER TO STEM THE TIDE OF </p><p>EXTREMISM IN THE VIOLENCE-PLAGUED TOWN.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>WE HAVE HEARD FROM SEVERAL SOURCES THAT HAMAS </p><p>ACTIVISTS ARE PROMINENT IN MOSQUES IN BLIDA, </p><p>NAHNAH\'S HOME TOWN. </p><p> </p><p>WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR MONEY? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HAMAS FINANCING </p><p>OUTSIDE THE PARTY, BUT THE NEWLY PASSED PARTY LAW, </p><p>WHICH GOVERNS FINANCING, MAY IMPEDE HAMAS\' </p><p>FUNDRAISING.  HAMAS OFFICIALS WERE VISIBLY UNHAPPY </p><p>WITH THE NEWLY PASSED PARTY LAW\'S CEILING ON </p><p>INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS (THE LIMIT IS DA 450--IE. </p><p>USD 8--MONTHLY).  IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH US, </p><p>HAMAS OFFICIALS HAVE IMPLIED THAT THEY HAVE WEALTHY </p><p>CONTRIBUTORS LOCALLY.  IN ADDITION, MANY OBSERVERS </p><p>HERE THINK HAMAS RECEIVES FINANCIAL HELP FROM SMALL </p><p>AND MEDIUM-SIZE BUSINESSES IN TOWNS SUCH AS BLIDA. </p><p>FINALLY, SEVERAL POLITICAL JOURNALISTS--BOTH PRO- </p><p>AND ANTI-ISLAMIST--ASSUME THAT HAMAS RECEIVES FUNDS </p><p>FROM PRIVATE SOURCES IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. </p><p>(COMMENT:  THE NEW PARTY LAW WOULD BAN SUCH </p><p>CONTRIBUTI0NS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  HAMAS PROBABLY WILLQOMPLETELY </p><p>ECLIPSE THE FIS--DESPITE GOA EFFORTS TO SURPRESS </p><p>TOTALLY THIS ORGANIZATION--WITHIN ALGERIA\'S ISLAMIST </p><p>MOVEMENT.  MANY DEDICATED SUPPORTERS OF THE FIS ARE </p><p>LIKELY T0 REMAIN OPPOSED TO ANY AFFILIATION WITH </p><p>HAMAS, PARTICULARILY SINCE MANY ALSO BELIEVE NAHNAH </p><p>WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BETRAYING AN EARLIER ARMED </p><p>ISLAMIST LEADER (BOUYALI) IN THE 1980\'S. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  NONETHELESS, WE ARE SKEPTICAL OF CLAIMS </p><p>THAT HAMAS\' FOLLOWING WOULD EVAPORATE WERE THE FIS </p><p>TO BE AGAIN ALLOWED TO FUNCTION LEGALLY.  FOR ONE </p><p>THING, A P0RTION OF FORMER FIS SUPPORTERS ARE </p><p>REPULSED BY THE TERRORISM FOR WHICH THEY HOLD THE </p><p>FIS ACC0UNTABLE.  IN ADDITION, HAMAS ALSO HAS </p><p>DEVELOPED A DISTINCT BASE OF ITS OWN, LARGELY </p><p>THROUGH PATIENT GRASSR0OTS WORK.  DURING THE </p><p>UPCOMING LEGISLATIVE ELECTION CAMPAIGN, HAMAS WILL </p><p>SEEK TO BROADEN ITS APPEAL T0 THE MASS OF FIS VOTERS </p><p>FROM 1990 AND 1991 WHO PRESUMABLY SEEK ALTERNATIVES </p><p>AFTER YEARS OF DISAPPOINTMENT.  IN 1995, MANY OF </p><p>THESE VOTERS TURNED TO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE </p><p>NAHNAH.  (ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL RESULTS, NAHNAH </p><p>WON 25 PERCENT--ABOUT 2.8 MILLION VOTES--IN THE 1995 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTI0N.  WE EVEN HEARD STORIES THAT </p><p>ARMED GR0UPS URGED V0TERS IN SOME ALGIERS </p><p>NEIGHBORH0ODS T0 VOTE F0R NAHNAH.) </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C)  THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTH OF THE HAMAS ORGANIZATION. </p><p>FIRST, THE NEW LAW REGULATING POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>OUTLAWS LINKS BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTIES AND </p><p>NON-POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS, SUCH AS STUDENT GROUPS </p><p>AND CHARITY ORGANIZATIONS.  HAMAS WILL REORGANIZE </p><p>THESE TIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE LAW.  SECOND, </p><p>SOME DOUBT THAT HAMAS COULD MAINTAIN COHESION IF </p><p>NAHNAH DEPARTS THE SCENE SUDDENLY.  INDEED, THE </p><p>FOCUS ON NAHNAH PREVENTS OTHER MEMBERS 0F THE HAMAS </p><p>EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AND MAJLES ASH-SHOURA FROM </p><p>BUILDING THEIR OWN REPUTATIONS.  (BY CONTRAST, THE </p><p>FIS HAD, IN BASEBALL TERMS, "DEEP DEPTH;" WHEN </p><p>ABASSI MADANI AND BENHADJ WERE ARRESTED IN JUNE </p><p>1991, ABDELKADER HACHANI AND MOHAMED SAID ABLY LED </p><p>THE PARTY TO ELECTORAL VICTORY IN DECEMBER.)  HAMAS\' </p><p>SECOND ECHELON LEADERS ARE USUALLY UNDER FORTY YEARS </p><p>OLD, AND THEY HAVE TIME T0 BUILD THEIR NATIONAL </p><p>CREDENTIALS.  M0REOVER, WITH HAMAS EXPECTED TO WIN </p><p>MANY SEATS IN THE NEXT, ELECTED PARLIAMENT, THESE </p><p>YOUNGER LEADERS MAY GAIN A MORE PROMINENT ROLE. </p><p>0VER COMING WEEKS, IF TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT, WE </p><p>WILL DEVEL0P DETAILS ON THE FUTURE LEADERS 0F </p><p>ALGERIA\'S DOMINANT ISLAMIST 0RGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>NEUMANN </p><p></p><p></p></div>
