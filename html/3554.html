<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004755 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR NOVELLI/SAUMS </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  JORDAN QIZ INVESTORS BRING CONCERNS TO ISRAELI </p><p>OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  AMMAN 3296 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>This is a joint message with Embassy Tel Aviv. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Summary.  Thanks to a meeting organized by the </p><p>Israel-Jordan Chamber of Commerce, an impressive number of </p><p>QIZ investors were able to raise directly with senior </p><p>Israeli officials their concerns about slow and expensive </p><p>shipping of QIZ products through Israel and difficulty </p><p>meeting the current 8% Israeli content requirement for goods </p><p>qualifying for duty and quota free access to the U.S. </p><p>market.  Israeli officials, perhaps impressed by the </p><p>enthusiasm of the QIZ investors, were partially responsive </p><p>to their concerns -- although they also surfaced the </p><p>potentially difficult issue of the scheduled 2003 increase </p><p>in the Israeli content requirement to 11.7%.  This was a </p><p>productive start to a hopefully ongoing dialogue that would </p><p>be even more useful with the participation of Jordanian </p><p>government officials.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>ABOUT 100 QIZ INVESTORS GATHER AT NORTHERN BRIDGE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Approximately 80-100 representatives of companies </p><p>and park managers from Jordan\'s five leading Qualifying </p><p>Industrial Zones (QIZ\'s) attended an August 2 meeting with </p><p>an approximately equal number of Israeli suppliers and </p><p>government officials.  Organized by the Israel-Jordan </p><p>Chamber of Commerce with the help of the Israeli foreign </p><p>ministry, the meeting was held in a tent erected on the </p><p>premises of the Israeli facility at the Shaikh Hussein </p><p>northern border crossing.  This arrangement accommodated </p><p>both Israeli security concerns and the desire of many of the </p><p>QIZ participants, especially those from south Asian </p><p>countries, not to have to obtain Israeli visas and entry </p><p>stamps in their passports that could have created </p><p>difficulties when they returned to their home countries. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  In addition to the private sector participants, </p><p>Israeli government representatives included deputy director </p><p>general of the ministry of foreign affairs Yossi Gal and MFA </p><p>Director for Middle East Economic Affairs Ilan Baruch, </p><p>deputy director general of the ministry of trade Gabi Bar </p><p>and several members of his staff, a representative of </p><p>Israeli customs, and a Haifa port official.  After some </p><p>internal discussion, the Jordanian government declined to </p><p>send representatives.  Members of embassy Tel Aviv and Amman </p><p>economic sections and USAID Jordan also observed the </p><p>proceedings.  They mayor of Bet Shean was unable to attend </p><p>but sent a message expressing her region\'s interest in </p><p>expanded commercial interaction with northern Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu) In contrast to the private sector representatives, </p><p>Jordanian government officials did not attend.  Trade </p><p>Ministry Secretary General Samer Tawil told Embassy Amman </p><p>that it would be too politically risky for Jordanian </p><p>government officials to be seen meeting Israeli counterparts </p><p>in the immediate aftermath of the killing of Hamas\' Salah </p><p>Shehadeh.  Nevertheless, Tawil said the Jordanian government </p><p>supported QIZ private sector participation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Freight and Trucking Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  The Israeli organizers kept the discussions focused </p><p>on the practical issues of doing business between Israel and </p><p>Jordan.  Israeli freight forwarder Gadi Sassower led a </p><p>discussion of logistical and trucking issues.  Along with </p><p>several other participants he noted the large increase in </p><p>QIZ-related shipments across the bridge.  He said that the </p><p>number of containers shipped to Haifa from Jordan was </p><p>currently 400-600 per month, up from just a handful three or </p><p>four years ago.  QIZ company reps raised slow processing </p><p>procedures and what they said were limited opening hours at </p><p>the bridge, as well as the high cost of back-to-back </p><p>shipping and convoying from the bridge to Haifa.  The </p><p>Israeli customs officials said that they were taking action </p><p>to speed shipments, although they said that slow out- </p><p>processing on the Jordanian side was another constraint.  In </p><p>one innovation, they announced that beginning September 1, </p><p>the requirement to convoy trucks from the bridge to Haifa </p><p>would be eliminated in cases where containers are </p><p>transferred to Israeli trucks.  The QIZ companies welcomed </p><p>this, but also asked the Israelis to look other ways to ease </p><p>shipping and reduce the need to post expensive customs </p><p>guarantees. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Speeding Up Product Approvals </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  Gabi Bar of the Israeli trade ministry acknowledged </p><p>complaints from QIZ companies that his ministry\'s processing </p><p>of applications for qualifying products (so-called QPR\'s) </p><p>was slow, particularly given the upsurge in QIZ business. </p><p>To help speed things up, Bar said the staff of the </p><p>ministry\'s QIZ unit had been increased by one person and the </p><p>frequency of inter-departmental meetings to review QPR </p><p>applications had been increased.  Further improvements were </p><p>unlikely given the ministry\'s budgetary constraints.  In </p><p>response to a request, a representative of the USAID- </p><p>supported Jordan-US Business Partnership (JUSBP) described a </p><p>new on-line QPR application process that should be up and </p><p>running in Jordan soon.  Linking the Israeli side into this </p><p>web-based system could help speed procedures without </p><p>requiring new staff. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Israelis Defensive About Content Requirements </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (u)  Several QIZ participants said that the current 8% </p><p>Israeli content requirement was holding back the potential </p><p>of the QIZ initiative.  They claimed that it was often </p><p>difficult, especially for high unit-price products, to reach </p><p>the 8% level and that Israeli suppliers often provided low </p><p>quality inputs at inflated prices.  These investors called </p><p>for either a reduction in the current 8% Israeli content </p><p>requirement or a new formula that would allow calculation of </p><p>Israeli content on a range of products instead of the </p><p>current product-by-product calculation.  They argued that </p><p>Israeli suppliers would share in the benefits from QIZ </p><p>growth if the requirement were reduced. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (u)  Bar replied that Israeli input was the key </p><p>philosophical and political basis of the QIZ initiative. </p><p>Indeed, he said, QIZ companies should be willing to pay even </p><p>more for duty and quota free access to the U.S. market.  He </p><p>said he resented efforts by some QIZ companies to keep </p><p>Israeli input to "eight point zero" despite the availability </p><p>of competitive Israeli suppliers.  Nevertheless, Bar added </p><p>that he was "brainstorming" with his Jordanian counterparts </p><p>on creative ways to calculate Israeli input. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (u)  Bar also noted that the five-year Israeli-Jordanian </p><p>agreement to lower the content requirement to 8% would end </p><p>next year and revert to its "normal" 11.7% level.  This </p><p>comment provoked an outburst of concern from QIZ investors, </p><p>who said that they could not operate economically at this </p><p>level.  They said they would have no choice but to move to </p><p>other locations that offer preferential access to the QIZ </p><p>market, particularly noting the growth in Kenya\'s and </p><p>Madagascar\'s garment exports to the U.S. under the AGOA </p><p>program.  This promises to be a high profile issue for the </p><p>QIZ program over the coming months. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Assessment: A Promising Start to a Useful Dialogue </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (u)  The number of participants was a surprise even for </p><p>the organizers and showed the great enthusiasm for the QIZ </p><p>program on both sides of the Jordan River.  As the first </p><p>such meeting, the discussion was general and there was more </p><p>than a bit of speechmaking on both sides.  Outgoing Israel- </p><p>Jordan Chamber of Commerce Director Miki Jungreis said that </p><p>the Chamber would look into organizing future meetings and </p><p>forming smaller working groups to study issues in greater </p><p>detail.  The MFA\'s Yossi Gal told Embassy Tel Aviv econoff </p><p>that as one of the negotiators of the QIZ arrangement, the </p><p>meeting was a dream come true for him.  The discussions </p><p>suffered from the absence of Jordanian government officials </p><p>(the meeting generated a handful of critical articles in the </p><p>Jordanian press).  Overall, however, the event succeeded in </p><p>allowing Israeli officials to hear directly from the QIZ </p><p>investor community about their practical concerns.  It also </p><p>gave a more concrete sense of the success of the initiative </p><p>and its continuing potential for increasing business </p><p>contacts between Jordan and Israel. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
