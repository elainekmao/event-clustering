<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 003277 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB, OES/EGC, EUR/ERA,EUR/WE </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USDA FOR FAS/SIMMONS, BLUM, AND MACKE </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/OEURA/CPD/DEFALCO </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS US EPA OPC STEPHEN JOHNSON </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR/NOUECCI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, SENV, TSPL, KSCA, EAID, PGOV, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR RAISES CLIMATE CHANGE, EU CHEMICALS </p><p>POLICY, AND BIOTECHNOLOGY WITH MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Mel Sembler for reasons 1.5 B and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. Ambassador met Minister of Environment Altero </p><p>Matteoli July 2 to discuss priority issues that might emerge </p><p>during the Italian EU Presidency. Ambassador praised Italy\'s </p><p>position on climate change and Kyoto, pointing out that PM </p><p>Berlusconi had taken a significant political risk in </p><p>promoting research cooperation with the U.S. at a time when </p><p>most member states were critical of the President\'s decision </p><p>to withdraw from the Kyoto protocol.  On the EU chemicals </p><p>proposal (REACH), Matteoli said that industry would have to </p><p>deal with environment ministries and their concerns, but the </p><p>days were past when environment ministries were enemies of </p><p>industry.  Matteoli added that he would include economic </p><p>considerations in the Italian appproach. Despite strong </p><p>representations from Ambassador on the need for strong </p><p>science-based policy on biotechnology, Matteoli said the only </p><p>solution for Italy would be found in a complex, step-by-step </p><p>political process. He acknowledged the successful blocking </p><p>role of Agriculture Minister Alemanno.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador hosted Minister of Environment Altero </p><p>Matteoli for lunch at the residence on July 2. Matteoli was </p><p>accompanied by his diplomatic adviser, Gabrielle Sardo, and </p><p>Director General for International Activities Corrado Clini. </p><p>Ambassador was joined by ECMIN and EST Counselor. </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S CALL FOR LEADERSHIP ON BIOTECH UNANSWERED </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador contrasted the leadership shown by the GOI </p><p>on climate change in 2001, when PM Berlusconi announced on </p><p>the eve of the Genoa G-8 summit a new commitment to research </p><p>cooperation with the U.S. outside of Kyoto, with the much </p><p>slower GOI approach to biotechnology policy.  Matteoli </p><p>replied that the biotechnology question was far more </p><p>complicated politically than Kyoto, in large measure because </p><p>the ideological convictions  of MINAG Alemanno made him less </p><p>receptive to mediation efforts, even within Alleanza </p><p>Nazionale (AN), the party of Alemanno and Matteoli. </p><p>According to the Minister,  the only solutions possible for </p><p>Italy will lie in slow and careful political moves. Matteoli </p><p>dismissed the weight of scientific opinions, labelling </p><p>scientists as outliers in the public debate.   Matteoli said </p><p>that he had worked hard on the EU traceability and labeling </p><p>proposals to keep at least an opening for biotechnology in </p><p>Europe. While Alemanno might follow him one step, the </p><p>Minister of Agriculture would not allow himself to be led </p><p>very far on the issue.  Matteoli held out little hope of </p><p>effective mediation with Alemanno even within AN, pointing </p><p>out that the wings of the party were sharply divided on </p><p>biotechnology policy.  He claimed that Alemanno\'s convictions </p><p>were genuinely felt, and formed under the ideological </p><p>mentorship of a strong rightwing leader, Pino Rauti, who was </p><p>for a time Alemanno\'s father-in-law as well. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Embassy comments: Although DG Clini floated the </p><p>possibility of a "consultation" with the U.S. on </p><p>biotechnology after the European Parliament votes on F&F and </p><p>T&L July 2-3, we doubt we can get much leverage with the GOI, </p><p>as EU President, through a meeting led by the MOE.  We </p><p>continue to worry that Alemanno, a strong supporter of the </p><p>coexistence language amending 01/018, will use this language </p><p>to step over the Ministry of Environment and others in the </p><p>GOI to exclude from Italy even those biotech products </p><p>approved by the EU under the new directives and regulations. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p>A BALANCED APPROACH ON CHEMICALS POLICY.... </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) REACH, the European Chemicals Policy, is still caught </p><p>between the competencies of the Environment Council and the </p><p>Competitiveness Council, according to Matteoli. The Minister </p><p>observed that however the decision turns out, the chemicals </p><p>industry will have to work with environment ministries. </p><p>These ministries, he argued, are no longer a priori hostile </p><p>to industry, but do have a responsibility to protect the </p><p>public and the environment while simultaneously promoting </p><p>economic growth.  Ambassador noted that U.S. companies had </p><p>invested more than $2.5 billion in Italy, and that U.S. </p><p>companies were concerned with the potential high costs of the </p><p>REACH proposal. Matteoli said that a discussion of REACH at </p><p>European level could take place during the Italian EU </p><p>Presidency, but that the Irish Presidency would have to carry </p><p>forward the work.  The Minister added that the record of the </p><p>chemicals industry would make credible work on regulation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>more difficult in Italy, since state-owned industry had for </p><p>years not only contributed to dangerous pollution, but had </p><p>used the threat of job losses in negotiations with unions and </p><p>local governmental authorities to delay the implementation of </p><p>environmental safety rules. </p><p> </p><p>SOME CLIMATE CHANGE "BUSINESS" WITH THE RUSSIANS, THE EU, AND </p><p>US... </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) Looking toward COP-9 of the U.N. Framework Convention </p><p>on Climate Change(UNFCCC), to be hosted by the MOE in Milan </p><p>in early December, the Ministry is preoccupied with what to </p><p>do if Russia ratifies the Kyoto Protocol, and what to do if </p><p>it does not. The EU, and Minister Matteoli in particular, has </p><p>been in Moscow several times in recent months to explore the </p><p>issue of Russian ratification. According to the Italians, </p><p>talks have boiled down to the price per ton of carbon dioxide </p><p>Russia could sell the EU to help the EU meet its targets. </p><p>The Russians have reportedly opened at USD forty per ton, </p><p>while the EU started at about USD five per ton. </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) If Russian ratification does not occur, and Kyoto does </p><p>not come into force, the MOE may open during the Italian EU </p><p>Presidency an internal EU dialogue on what to do next in the </p><p>face of the EU and member state ratifications of the Protocol. </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) DG Clini confirmed decisions taken in Washington June </p><p>17 to organize a bilateral energy meeting in Califiornia in </p><p>September, and a side event at COP-9 to highlight the results </p><p>of U.S.-Italy cooperation in climate change. Clini reiterated </p><p>his hope that a twinning agreement could be struck between </p><p>the region of Lombardia and the State of California on </p><p>hydrogen technologies. </p><p> </p><p>AND FIRST STEPS TOWARD COOPERATION WITH THE DEVELOPING WORLD </p><p> </p><p>9.(U) Ambassador noted to the Minister our satisfaction with </p><p>the new agreement on geospatial technologies and applications </p><p>signed at the June 17-18 S&T bilaterals, and the agreement to </p><p>work on geothermal projects in East Africa and to cooperate </p><p>on environmental projects in Iraq.  Such partnerships can </p><p>demonstrate to the developing world the seriousness with </p><p>which both countries take environmental stewardship. </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) Embassy Comment. Matteoli began the luncheon </p><p>conversation stiffly but warmed to the Ambassador\'s questions </p><p>about coalition politics and its future, having some fun with </p><p>key ministers like Bossi and Tremonti: the Finance Minister </p><p>is reportedly the only coalition minister who will dine with </p><p>Bossi. He spoke clearly to divisions within his own AN </p><p>party--an internal division is 100 times worse than a </p><p>controversy between parties, he opined.  The Minister is </p><p>obviously more comfortable in the political arena, in which </p><p>he characterizes himself as a mediator, than in technical </p><p>discussions of even the major issues in his portfolio. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03277 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
