<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 000470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAGR, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: LAND AUDIT:  DISAVOWED DOCUMENT ACKNOWLEDGES </p><p>CORRUPTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAND AUDIT REPORT FAXED TO AF/S </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary.  Long plagued by accusations of chaos and </p><p>official corruption in its Land Reform and Resettlement </p><p>Program (LRRP), the GOZ has promised since last September a </p><p>land audit to investigate program implementation.  Various </p><p>other unofficial lists purporting to document this official </p><p>corruption have been circulated by interested parties, </p><p>including the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) and Justice for </p><p>Agriculture (JAG).  Despite GOZ assurances that it was </p><p>looking into such accusations, no official report has ever </p><p>been released.  However, three documents distributed as </p><p>"leaked" copies of the official interim report on the land </p><p>audit (ref) have been making the rounds of the diplomatic </p><p>community and the international press.  Now that newspapers </p><p>have published excerpts from the "leaked" report, one </p><p>GOZ-linked newspaper has claimed that an official report does </p><p>not exist.  In our view, the report is likely genuine, </p><p>although unlikely to be officially acknowledged.  Leaking of </p><p>the document, however, has had the useful effect of exposing </p><p>at least some of the shenanigans and putting more pressure on </p><p>Zanu-PF to correct the abuses.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Report?  What Report? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU)  In addition to recent summaries appearing in the </p><p>newsletter "Africa Confidential" and the Financial Times, a </p><p>report on the official LRRP land audit appeared in the </p><p>pro-Zanu-PF weekly the Sunday Mirror.  However, the following </p><p>week (March 2, 2003), the Sunday Mirror headlined, "Govt </p><p>Denies Existence of Land Audit Report."  In the text of the </p><p>article, the denial continues (begin text):  "There is no </p><p>such report, and whatever report there is, is merely an </p><p>invention of the enemies of the State," a senior government </p><p>official said... He strongly castigated the Sunday Mirror for </p><p>having reproduced the "Africa Confidential" report, which </p><p>broke the story in its February 21 issue.  "It was an act of </p><p>mischief on your (the Sunday Mirror\'s) part to have </p><p>reproduced that story, for there was definitely no report to </p><p>leak since it does not exist," the official reprimanded. (End </p><p>text.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Detailing the Abuses </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU)  The first of the three documents details abuses </p><p>within both the Ministry of Lands and local government bodies </p><p>in implementing LRRP, among them: </p><p>-- failure of the Ministry to release state land for </p><p>resettlement </p><p>-- failure of the Ministry of Lands to delist some wrongfully </p><p>acquired farms despite clear administrative guidelines, </p><p>including agro-industrial farms, plantations, export </p><p>production zones, and properties protected by Bilateral </p><p>Investment Treaties (BITs) </p><p>-- failure of the Ministry to implement the "one man one </p><p>farm" policy, both for white and indigenous farmers </p><p>-- failure of the Ministry  to implement maximum farm sizes </p><p>for allocations of A2 plots, as delineated within each </p><p>agro-ecological region </p><p>-- failure of the Ministry to act on LA3 Forms (forms by </p><p>which a property owner subdivides his own land and offers </p><p>land in excess of the maximum farm size to the GOZ for </p><p>resettlement) </p><p>-- allocation of separate A2 plots to both spouses of a </p><p>married couple "contrary to policy" </p><p>-- allocation of multiple A2 plots to some </p><p>politically-connected beneficiaries </p><p>-- re-designation of A1, or small-scale de-congestion plots, </p><p>to A2, or large-scale commercial plots </p><p>-- issuance of "Certificates of No Present Interest" to </p><p>indigenous buyers (and thus permission to purchase) for farms </p><p>which have already been formally resettled </p><p>-- failure of the Ministry to promptly assess amount of </p><p>compensation payable for improvements on acquired farms </p><p>-- bad-faith actions of local District Land Committees in </p><p>targeting specific inappropriate properties (including hotels </p><p>and guest houses) for the benefit of "local political </p><p>heavyweights" </p><p>-- actions of some local politicians in interfering with </p><p>District Land Committees and allocating land based on their </p><p>own preferences </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  The first document also details inadequacies in the </p><p>GOZ\'s implementation of support for the LRRP, including: </p><p>-- crop and seed input schemes </p><p>-- fertilizer supply schemes </p><p>-- transport for crop inputs </p><p>-- tillage services </p><p>-- livestock development schemes ("heifer loan scheme") </p><p>-- irrigation equipment rehabilitation </p><p>-- and borehole (well) drilling for both potable water and </p><p>irrigation purposes </p><p> </p><p>The lack of coherent policy regarding conservancies is </p><p>briefly highlighted, and one paragraph addresses the "Farm </p><p>Workers Plight," noting that many districts do not have </p><p>statistics on the number of farm workers and their current </p><p>activities or whereabouts.  The impetus behind this concern </p><p>is revealed, however, in the final sentence:  "...these farm </p><p>workers were not only disrupting the operations of A2 farmers </p><p>but have also been reported to be poaching and cutting down </p><p>trees in certain areas." </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  The Interim Report closes with a list of </p><p>recommendations and advice for getting the LRRP back on </p><p>track.  The recommendations include, </p><p> </p><p>-- "Seed houses should be encouraged to produce adequate seed </p><p>through the regular and timeous review of seed prices." </p><p>-- "Fertiliser producers should be encouraged to produce </p><p>adequate quantities through the regular and timeous review of </p><p>fertiliser prices." </p><p> </p><p>In conclusion, the report cites "the successful A1 Model of </p><p>resettlement," while criticizing the  shortcomings in the A2 </p><p>model such as "multiple allocation of plots to certain </p><p>individuals and slow uptake."  The conclusion acknowledges </p><p>"the current disgruntled feeling among the masses who </p><p>expressed their disappointment at the lack of transparency in </p><p>the implementation of the (LRRP)," and exhorts the GOZ to </p><p>"quickly re-align" the program to "equitably redistribute the </p><p>land in Zimbabwe and empower the indigenous people through </p><p>land ownership." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Addendum -- or Hall of Shame </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>6. (SBU)  The second document, the Addendum, names names. </p><p>Several Zanu-PF stalwarts are mentioned, including </p><p>pro-Zanu-PF Mutumwa Mawere and Ibo Mandaza, both of whom have </p><p>"purchased" several already resettled farms.  The Addendum </p><p>states that Dr. Mandaza purchased five separate farms </p><p>totaling over 7,500 hectares, and "has since taken the </p><p>settled families to court in an attempt to evict them from </p><p>the properties."  War veterans Chris Pasipamire (currently </p><p>pursuing a PhD in England) and Mike Moyo are "violently </p><p>evicting 36 settlers... some (of whom) have been </p><p>assaulted..."  The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs </p><p>Abednico Ncube is reportedly behind the attempt to "acquire" </p><p>two established hotels.  Mashonaland Central Governor E. </p><p>Manyika (sic) is identified for allocating A2 farms above 350 </p><p>hectares -- some, such as the 1500 hectare farm allocated to </p><p>Minister of Mines and Mining Chindori-Chininga, well above </p><p>the 200 hectare maximum farm size -- thus preventing greater </p><p>numbers of indigenous people from benefiting.  Minister for </p><p>Small and Medium Enterprises Development Sithembisu Nyoni </p><p>reportedly claimed a highly-developed citrus, poultry and </p><p>livestock farm as an A2 allocation directly from Harare -- </p><p>despite the fact that the farm was earmarked at the local </p><p>level for youths from the National Service training program </p><p>as an "agricultural skills training center." </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  The most interesting part of the addendum lists </p><p>those who have taken multiple farms.  A Zanu-PF Who\'s Who </p><p>list, some of the beneficiaries of multiple farms include: </p><p>-- Minister Ignatius Chombo, MP J. Gumbo, Governor Josiah </p><p>Hungwe, Brig. Kanhanga, Minister Elliot Manyika, Mutumwa </p><p>Mawere, Minister and Mrs. Kembo Mohadi, Sabina Mugabe, </p><p>Boniface Shamu, ZRP Spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena (2 farms </p><p>each); </p><p>-- MP Kasukuwere, Minister Jonathan Moyo, Governor Obert </p><p>Mpofu, Air Marshall Perence Shiri (3 farms each); </p><p>-- MP S. Mahofa (four farms); </p><p>-- Governor P. Chanetsa (four farms plus one allocated to his </p><p>spouse); and </p><p>-- C. Chingosho (seven farms). </p><p> </p><p>The addendum notes that "The list is not exhaustive as the </p><p>people interviewed were scared to reveal any information </p><p>least (sic) they might be victimised by the multiple farm </p><p>owners who seem to have their loyalists within the various </p><p>land committees." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>GOZ Expresses Shocked Surprise -- and Little Will to Act </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>8. (SBU)  The third document comprises minutes of a meeting </p><p>dated Monday December 9. The Chairman of the meeting, Vice </p><p>President Msika, states his intention to "reappraise </p><p>everybody present on the developments taking place in the </p><p>LRRP."  He immediately "expressed his utter dismay at the </p><p>chaotic condition on the ground which contradicted His </p><p>Excellency\'s pronouncements on the LRRP..."  After reviewing </p><p>the Interim Report, the committee suggested action which </p><p>paralleled the suggestions of the Report itself. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  A fourth document detailing a second, follow-up </p><p>meeting, produced the lone strong statement:  "While </p><p>Government should continue to proffer assistance to the </p><p>farmers care should be exercised to prevent the setting in of </p><p>the dependency syndrome.  Already some of the farmers </p><p>appeared to be entirely waiting on Government for support. </p><p>The farmers should be disabused of this misconception.  After </p><p>all, in their applications, A2 farmers had to prove that they </p><p>had capacity to mobilise the necessary resources. </p><p>Furthermore, many seemed to be under the illusion that the </p><p>farms had been allocated gratis.  A lease document was to be </p><p>formulated spelling out the terms of payment for the </p><p>properties." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>10. (SBU)  At some level, the GOZ seems to be aware of its </p><p>unsustainable position regarding the A2 aspect of its land </p><p>reform program.  The report paints a picture of thousands of </p><p>expectant "settlers," many of them not even farmers, placed </p><p>on haphazardly allocated pieces of land and waiting for the </p><p>impecunious government to till the land and source and </p><p>deliver all necessary inputs.  Because agriculture is so </p><p>central to the Zimbabwean economy, the GOZ now has little </p><p>choice but to continue pouring money into this failed scheme </p><p>in an effort to restart the economy.  The GOZ is responsible </p><p>for a debacle wherein local strongmen have felt free to step </p><p>in and manipulate the process to their advantage -- resulting </p><p>in multiple allocations to key figures, re-allocation of </p><p>previously settled land, and allocation of land to </p><p>non-farmers unequipped to run a productive farm. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  The public complaints of Zanu-PF activists over </p><p>abuses in the land redistribution program at the December </p><p>Zanu-PF conference in Chinoyi first prompted President Mugabe </p><p>to promise a land audit.  For undertaking this initiative, </p><p>Minister Flora Buka was reportedly sidelined and the report </p><p>was pigeonholed until it surfaced outside Zimbabwe, leading </p><p>to its unsourced disavowal in the GOZ press.  While it is </p><p>impossible to state unequivocally that the leaked documents </p><p>are genuine, much of the information contained therein is </p><p>consistent with other publicly available information.  It is </p><p>our view that the report is likely genuine, but that the GOZ </p><p>will be reluctant to release it into the public domain. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
