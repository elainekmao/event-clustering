<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 005001 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: DERVIS HINTS AT CHALLENGING INEFFECTUAL </p><p>BAYKAL FOR OPPOSITION CHP LEADERSHIP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4862 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 2048 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: As opposition CHP struggles in public opinion </p><p>polls, former State Minister/current CHP M.P. Kemal Dervis is </p><p>beginning to push for a more visible role in the party, and </p><p>to hint that he may eventually challenge Deniz Baykal for the </p><p>party chairmanship.  Surrounding himself largely with </p><p>western-trained newcomers to politics, to CHP, and to </p><p>Parliament, Dervis is trying to alter his party\'s stale, </p><p>shopworn political image as rubber-stamp to an increasingly </p><p>out-of-touch Establishment.  Should Dervis try to follow </p><p>through, he would face an uphill challenge.  His success </p><p>would depend on whether he can loosen Baykal\'s viselike grip </p><p>on the CHP apparatus and Parliamentary group by: 1) </p><p>demonstrating decisive political leadership and character -- </p><p>which he may not in fact posses; and 2) overcoming his own </p><p>elitist-statist political inclinations and abandoning his </p><p>often uncritical public support for Kemalist equities -- </p><p>something he has so far been loath to do.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>A Listless Opposition </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Recent resignations of two M.P.s (ref A) -- and the </p><p>possibility of more to come -- from main opposition CHP have </p><p>brought forward barely concealed fissures within the party. </p><p>According to a recent public opinion poll, support for CHP </p><p>has dipped to 16 percent -- well below the support the party </p><p>garnered in the Nov. 2002 national elections -- while support </p><p>for the ruling AK Party has increased to around 40 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Staunch Kemalists, for whom CHP is the only </p><p>Establishment representative on the national political scene, </p><p>are criticizing the party in harsh terms for Baykal\'s </p><p>recklessness and, more importantly, his inability to inspire </p><p>the faithful.  Sina Aksin, a professor at Ankara University\'s </p><p>prestigious Political Sciences Faculty, a bastion of Kemalist </p><p>rectitude, charged to us that CHP has become a hollow shell </p><p>of itself -- merely "the opium of the Kemalists."  Columnists </p><p>in Turkey\'s leading dailies are questioning the direction of </p><p>CHP and, more directly, Baykal for an unprincipled and </p><p>far-too-clever tactical approach to leadership.  Erol </p><p>Cevikce, a former Baykal confidant, described the CHP leader </p><p>to poloff Aug. 5 as a very bright but shallow; foreigners </p><p>meeting Baykal for the first time and unaware of his recent </p><p>statements in  Parliament "would no doubt think he is a </p><p>brilliant man," Cevikce said.  Baykal will do anything to win </p><p>votes, including rail against the U.S. even though he has </p><p>been a supporter of strong U.S.-Turkish relations. </p><p>Explaining Baykal\'s Janus-faced leadership style, CHP deputy </p><p>Damla Gurel told poloff recently that "when I hear what </p><p>Baykal says in Parliament, I am disgusted and consider </p><p>leaving CHP; when I travel with him abroad, I feel hopeful </p><p>again." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Dervis\' Team </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) With Baykal\'s weaknesses and high negative ratings in </p><p>the opinion polls, Kemal Dervis, formerly a state minister in </p><p>the previous Ecevit-led government and now a CHP Istanbul </p><p>Deputy, has been assiduously floating trial balloons to gauge </p><p>CHP and public support for a change in leadership.  His </p><p>suggestion that he will seek a position on CHP\'s central </p><p>committee at the party\'s general convention this fall has </p><p>been widely interpreted as heralding a possible direct </p><p>challenge to Baykal for the top spot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In private meetings with us, Dervis has said he wants </p><p>transform CHP into a pro-reform, "European-style social </p><p>democratic party" free of strong nationalist trappings -- in </p><p>essence arguing that CHP\'s problem is not that it is straying </p><p>away from Kemalism (the Aksin view), but that the Party of </p><p>Ataturk is still too firmly welded to the dominant and more </p><p>rigid form of the ideology.  Dervis has also argued to us </p><p>that CHP needs an infusion of youth to overcome the "1920s </p><p>Kemalist mentality" -- the xenophobic statist-nationalism </p><p>that, he says, pervades in the party administration (ref B). </p><p>To this end, Dervis has gathered a coterie of like-minded </p><p>M.P.s, including elements he personally recruited to the </p><p>party prior to last November\'s elections and other </p><p>self-professed social democrats.  Among these are: Damla </p><p>Gurel, who prior to joining CHP, had worked in Istanbul for </p><p>the ARI Movement, a well-connected centrist NGO; Istanbul </p><p>businessman and Harvard-trained economist Memduh Hacioglu; </p><p>Adana CHP deputy and outspoken feminist Gaye Erbatur; former </p><p>Aegean University professor Necdet Budak, who studied at the </p><p>Univ. of Nebraska; and Gulsun Bilgehan, granddaughter to </p><p>Ismet Inonu.  (Note: all of these deputies speak excellent </p><p>English. End note.)  These M.P.s work with Dervis, who heads </p><p>CHP\'s "Science Platform" research arm,  to analyze </p><p>legislation independent of the party central committee and </p><p>then present their views to the party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>A Fight Too Tough for the Dervis Tekke? </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Dervis and his colleagues admit that they face an </p><p>uphill battle in winning control of the party apparatus -- </p><p>one non-Dervisite described the Science Platform to us as an </p><p>organization "that produces reports no one reads" -- and </p><p>developing a new CHP ethos.  Dervis offered to us recently </p><p>that changing CHP from within is a slow process and that he </p><p>does not expect immediate results.  "There is still some </p><p>resistance from \'traditionalists,\'" he noted.  The resistance </p><p>is also weighing heavily on Dervis disciples Gurel and </p><p>Hacioglu, both political newcomers.  Gurel told poloff that, </p><p>if she did not believe in what Dervis is doing, she would </p><p>leave politics all together -- scant months after having </p><p>joined CHP.  Expressing his frustration with politics in </p><p>general, Hacioglu railed against "those circles who continue </p><p>to resist reform: CHP leadership, the bureaucracy, and the </p><p>army."  "I wish I had never left my business," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Dervis et al tell us that in addition to outright </p><p>opposition to intra-party reform, \'traditionalists\' also </p><p>often heap scorn on them for their supposed "Americanist" </p><p>(Amerikanci) outlook.  Before the failed March 1 vote in </p><p>Parliament that would have authorized deployment of U.S. </p><p>troops to Turkey in the run-up to the Iraq war, Dervis </p><p>privately told poloff that he felt he could not speak openly </p><p>in favor of strong U.S.-Turkish ties, because many in CHP </p><p>"already consider me an American agent."  More recently, </p><p>Dervis claimed that the incident in Sulaymaniyah (involving </p><p>the brief detention of Turkish troops by U.S. forces) had </p><p>"made his life difficult" by strengthening the hand of the </p><p>traditionalists.  Similarly, Budak explained to us late July </p><p>that he too has long been thought of as an Americanist, </p><p>which, he said, is a double-edged sword at best.  On the one </p><p>hand, CHP deputies go to Budak when they have questions about </p><p>the U.S.  On the other, Budak said he is aware of "people </p><p>whispering in the halls" against him, which in effect freezes </p><p>him out of the party administration loop. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>The Character Issue </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The key problem confronting Dervis, however, is not </p><p>his presumed Americanism but his own elitist-statist </p><p>inclination.  This, while more sophisticated than the </p><p>run-of-the-mill, rigid tendency exhibited by the party </p><p>cadres, does not sit well with the growing majority of voters </p><p>eager for change.  Dervis has also exhibited a lack of both </p><p>political acumen and the courage of his ostensibly </p><p>non-traditionalist convictions.  This might be even more </p><p>problematic for him, given that the principal indictments </p><p>against Baykal are based on exactly the same character flaws. </p><p> Before the 2002 elections, Dervis encouraged rebellion </p><p>within then P.M. Ecevit\'s center-left DSP, but left his </p><p>erstwhile colleagues twisting in the wind as he sought safe </p><p>harbor in CHP.  He also publicly proclaimed his support for </p><p>the Kemalist status quo as embodied by the National Security </p><p>Council (NSC) -- a move, widely perceived to be an effort to </p><p>pander to Turkey\'s powerful generals in the run-up to the </p><p>polls, that infuriated the reformist intellectuals who had </p><p>supported his rise to prominence and covered for him in their </p><p>columns.  More recently, Dervis has privately praised AK\'s </p><p>NSC-related and other reform efforts, while expressing to us </p><p>only the mildest of reservations about AK\'s ultimate goals. </p><p>To journalists, however, Dervis is promoting the specter of </p><p>AK as an "Islamic threat" to Turkey -- although as "Hurriyet" </p><p>columnist Cuneyt Ulsever offered to us recently, Dervis </p><p>"knows better."  While Dervis may be making such statements </p><p>to cover his political flanks, the impression he leaves is </p><p>that of a man without a political compass. </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Kemal the Apostate? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Dervis is now looking to CHP\'s convention this fall, </p><p>where he hopes to see changes to the party administration. </p><p>Beyond that looms next April\'s local elections, which many in </p><p>CHP view as a referendum on Baykal\'s leadership.  It is an </p><p>open question whether Dervis can, or in the final analysis is </p><p>inclined to, resist the strong pull of the Turkish </p><p>Establishment "traditions" that he privately assails, and </p><p>thus to avoid becoming just another in a long line of </p><p>unsuccessful political wannabes.  Moreover, Dervis is still </p><p>seen as a technocrat unwilling to sully his hands in the </p><p>dirty game of Turkish retail politics.  There is, in fact, an </p><p>unmistakable aura surrounding Dervis of elite technocratic </p><p>disapproval of Anatolian realities -- a quintessential CHP </p><p>characteristic that hurt the party badly in the 2002 </p><p>elections and helps explain its current dithering and </p><p>ineffectiveness.  In short, to succeed Dervis has to </p><p>demonstrate that he is neither Baykal nor a staunch Kemalist, </p><p>which given his present circumstances and disposition would </p><p>be tantamount to apostasy. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
