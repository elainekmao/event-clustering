Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Begin summary:  On July 8, Ambassador Hull met with </p><p>newly-appointed governor of Aden, Dr. Yahya Al-Shaibi. </p><p>Ambassador and Governor Shaibi agreed on the importance of </p><p>sustainable development, discussing Aden\'s status as a World </p><p>Bank Port City, and e-learning.  Ambassador highlighted the </p><p>re-assurance a professional Yemen Coast Guard will provide </p><p>international investors, and discussed possible future </p><p>security training for the Aden airport.  During the one-day </p><p>trip, Ambassador also attended a ROYG graduation for training </p><p>conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard, met with the Director </p><p>General and Deputy DG of Aden Airport, and bid farewell to </p><p>longtime Amideast representative Edward Prados (septel).  The </p><p>Ambassador was accompanied by OMC Chief, Coast Guard </p><p>Representative, Public Affairs Officer, and PolOff </p><p>(notetaker).  Representatives from numerous media outlets </p><p>covered the events (see septel).  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Governor of Aden </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  During the 7/8 trip to Aden, Ambassador met with the </p><p>new Governor of Aden, and former Minister of Education, Dr. </p><p>Yahya Al-Shaibi (bio note para #7), on an early morning </p><p>flight and again during a formal office call later that day. </p><p> Governor Shaibi began by joking that he and the Ambassador </p><p>already covered their agendas on the plane and introductions </p><p>were unnecessary, but turned serious, noting the need for </p><p>continued improvement in security, employment, investment, </p><p>restaurants, and tourism in Aden.  Shaibi noted that Aden has </p><p>been selected as a World Bank Port City, and said the initial </p><p>development plan should be ready next year.  He also noted </p><p>that he was visiting the Free Zone later that afternoon (7/8) </p><p>and hoped future development would turn around the 50% plus </p><p>reduction in the number of ships using the port. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>E-Learning </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Ambassador congratulated Shaibi on his appointment </p><p>and offered U.S. support for initiatives that strengthen </p><p>Aden, "a window on Yemen for the rest of the world." </p><p>Ambassador announced a $1.5 million E-Learning project that </p><p>will install internet in 20 classrooms across Yemen, </p><p>including 5 in Aden.  He explained that the E-Learning </p><p>program provides not only hardware, but installation and </p><p>training.  The goal, said the Ambassador, with the support of </p><p>ROYG and the business community, is to provide an academic </p><p>resource to link Yemen with the rest of the world.  In </p><p>addition, the local purchase of hardware should produce an </p><p>added economic stimulus.  The governor noted that the </p><p>Ministry of Education (MOE) also has a program by which </p><p>schools can obtain computers directly from MOE and pay only </p><p>3,000 rials ($24USD) a month.  In Aden, Shaibi said he is now </p><p>trying to create an e-government connected to both internal </p><p>and external networks.  He added that this connectivity will </p><p>help with basic information and administration. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Yemen Coast Guard </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Turning to the graduation ceremony in honor of the </p><p>conclusion of U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) training, Ambassador </p><p>shared the USG observation that the 21 Yemen Coast Guard, </p><p>Navy, and Special Forces officers who completed the training </p><p>were committed to their professions and enthusiastic -- all </p><p>the makings of a "first class operation."  He noted that a </p><p>professionally competent Yemen Coast Guard (YCG) will </p><p>showcase Aden\'s improved security posture to the world. </p><p>Shaibi added that, in addition to the YCG, ROYG considers </p><p>remote monitoring an important security upgrade for the port. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Aden Airport </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Ambassador briefed Shaibi on a possible visit by a </p><p>USG assessment team during the next six months to look at </p><p>Aden Airport\'s security posture.  He also mentioned the </p><p>formation of a professional association for graduates of U.S. </p><p>institutions; and highlighted the professionalism, as well as </p><p>additional USG funding, for ROYG\'s Aden-based Humanitarian </p><p>Demining Program. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>USAID </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Shaibi inquired about the return of AID, noting that </p><p>he was a USAID graduate in 1978 and that the government </p><p>"needed more people with similar backgrounds."  Shaibi said </p><p>the last batch of graduates are currently in high-level </p><p>positions but asked what will happen when they retire. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Bio Note </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Bio note - Governor of Aden Yahya al-Shaibi:  Former </p><p>Minister of Education, Dr. Yahya al-Shaibi is a </p><p>U.S.-educated, USAID Graduate (1978) with a PhD in Chemistry. </p><p> He speaks fluent English, and reportedly visited every state </p><p>in the continental U.S. during his studies in South Carolina. </p><p> He is currently on leave from his faculty position at the </p><p>University of Sanaa.
