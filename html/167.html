<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 04526 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PREL, CE, IN, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE LTTE FACES PROBLEMS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WE HAVE HEARD FROM A VARIETY OF RELIABLE SOURCES </p><p>THAT THE LTTE HAD BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED BY </p><p>OPERATION LIBERATION BEGUN IN LATE MAY AND THAT IT </p><p>HAD YET TO RECOUP ITS LOSSES.  PERHAPS THE MOST </p><p>DETAILED AND CREDIBLE REPORT CAME FROM LOUIS PAUL, </p><p>A SENIOR EDITOR OF THE SATURDAY REVIEW, A RESPECTED </p><p>JAFFNA FORTNIGHTLY WHICH MAINTAINS VERY GOOD TIES </p><p>WITH THE LTTE.  DCM AND POLCOUNS MET WITH PAUL, WHO </p><p>WAS IN COLOMBO FOR A FEW DAYS, ON JULY 7. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>THE EFFECT OF THE OFFENSIVE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  PAUL SAID THAT OPERATION LIBERATION WAS A REAL </p><p>TURNING POINT IN THE INSURGENCY SINCE IT RESULTED </p><p>IN THE ALIENATION FROM THE LTTE OF A MAJORITY OF </p><p>THE JAFFNA CIVILIAN POPULATION.  UNTIL THAT POINT, </p><p>MOST JAFFNA CITIZENS--INCLUDING THOSE WHO DID NOT </p><p>AGREE WITH LTTE AIMS OR METHODS--LOOKED UPON THE </p><p>TIGERS AS PROTECTORS WHO SHIELDED THE CIVILIANS FROM </p><p>THE GSL "ARMY OF OCCUPATION."  THE TIGERS IN MANY </p><p>INSTANCES IN MAY/JUNE ABROGATED THIS ROLE:  NOT </p><p>ONLY DID THEY NOT PROTECT THE PEOPLE BUT SOMETIMES </p><p>EVEN FAILED (BEFORE THEY THEMSELVES MELTED AWAY) TO </p><p>WARN THE POPULATION WHEN THEY HAD INTELLIGENCE </p><p>THAT A GSL OPERATION WAS PLANNED IN A SPECIFIC AREA. </p><p>THE COMMON MAN, ACCORDING TO PAUL, DOES NOT UNDERSTAND </p><p>THE DISAPPEARANCE FROM THE FIELD OF THE LTTE AS BEING </p><p>A STANDARD GUERRILLA TACTIC.  INSTEAD HE SEES IT AS </p><p>A BETRAYAL.  THE RESULT HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN </p><p>ATTITUDES, HE CLAIMS, WITH MANY PEOPLE SHIFTING THEIR </p><p>TRUST FROM THE LTTE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA AS THEIR </p><p>ONLY POSSIBLE "PROTECTOR."  NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME, </p><p>PAUL SAYS, PEOPLE IN JAFFNA ARE TALKING OPENLY ABOUT </p><p>ANNEXATION BY INDIA AS BEING AN ACCEPTABLE, EVEN </p><p>PREFERRED, SOLUTION TO THE CURRENT CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BOTH THE SIZE AND MORALE OF THE LTTE HAVE REPORTEDLY </p><p>DIPPED PRECIPITIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE OFFENSIVE.  PAUL </p><p>BELIEVES THAT THE LTTE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REPLACE MUCH </p><p>OF THE MUNITIONS AND EQUIPMENT IT LOST DURING THE </p><p>OFFENSIVE.  HE SAYS THAT TIGER MORALE REMAINS LOW.  THE </p><p>NUMBER OF CADRE TOO HAS DROPPED, PAUL SAID, FROM A HIGH </p><p>WHICH HE PLACED AT 7,000 TO SOME 3,000 NOW.  OF THAT </p><p>NUMBER, HE ESTIMATED, ONLY ABOUT 500 HAD RECEIVED ANY </p><p>REAL TRAINING.  WHEN THE OFFENSIVE CAME, MANY SIMPLY </p><p>QUIT FIGHTING BUT STAYED IN THE NORTH.  A NUMBER OF </p><p>YOUNG MEN HAVE LEFT NOT ONLY THE MOVEMENT BUT THE </p><p>ISLAND, CROSSING TO INDIA.  (EMBASSY COMMENT:  SOME </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY ARE COMING SOUTH AS WELL.  WE WERE TOLD </p><p>JULY 7 BY A WELL-PLACED TAMIL SOURCE IN COLOMBO THAT </p><p>HE WAS BUSY FINDING HOUSING AND PLACEMENT IN SCHOOLS </p><p>FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TAMIL YOUTH WHO HAVE </p><p>COME DOWN FROM JAFFNA PENINSULA IN RECENT DAYS.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>THE LTTE LEADERSHIP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  PAUL SAID THAT RECENT GSL CLAIMS OF SUCCESSES IN </p><p>KILLING VARIOUS TIGER LEADERS (WHICH WE HAD QUESTIONED </p><p>IN OUR LATEST WEEKLY ROUNDUP, COLOMBO 4388) ARE </p><p>ESSENTIALLY CORRECT.  HE SAID THAT THE SECURITY FORCES </p><p>HAVE "DECIMATED" THE UPPER-MIDDLE LEADERSHIP IN RECENT </p><p>MONTHS AND THAT PRABHAKARAN NOW SUFFERS FROM A DEARTH </p><p>OF QUALIFIED LIEUTENANTS.  MAHATHAYA (THE ALIAS SIMPLY </p><p>MEANS "MR."), THE FORMER KILINOCHCHI AREA COMMANDER </p><p>WHO WAS BROUGHT TO JAFFNA TO TAKE OVER AFTER KITTU WAS </p><p>WOUNDED EARLIER THIS YEAR, IS DEFINITELY PRABHAKARAN\'S </p><p>SENIOR LIEUTENANT NOW.  KITTU HOWEVER CONTINUES TO </p><p>REMAIN ACTIVE IN THE LTTE DESPITE SOME REPORTS HERE </p><p>THAT HE HAD LEFT THE ORGANIZATION AFTER THE ATTEMPT </p><p>ON HIS LIFE.  (EMBASSY COMMENT:  ACCORDING TO IQBAL </p><p>ATHAS, A COLOMBO JOURNALIST WHO REPORTS EXTENSIVELY </p><p>ON THE LTTE AND WHO HAS EXCELLENT CONTACTS WITH THEIR </p><p>LEADERSHIP, MAHATHAYA\'S REAL NAME IS MAHENDRA RAJA. </p><p>HE IS BETWEEN 35-40 YEARS OLD AND IS FROM VAVUNIYA </p><p>IN THE WANNI AREA SOUTH OF THE PENINSULA.  (SEE </p><p>COLOMBO 2374 OF APRIL 9 FOR WHAT OTHER FEW DETAILS </p><p>WE HAVE ON MAHATHAYA.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  BUT, AS WE HAVE REPORTED BEFORE, THE LTTE REMAINS </p><p>A HIGHLY CENTRALIZED AND AUTHORITARIAN ORGANIZATION. </p><p>PRABHAKARAN IS "THE ONLY LEADER" WHO COUNTS AT ALL. </p><p>IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO HIM, PAUL SAYS, THE </p><p>LTTE WOULD PROBABLY FALL APART.  PRABHAKARAN REMAINS </p><p>ON THE PENINSULA BUT CONTINUES TO STAY OUT OF SIGHT. </p><p>HE HAS REFUSED TO SEE ANY OF THE MANY JAFFNA </p><p>JOURNALISTS OR PROMINENT CITIZENS WHO HAVE ASKED </p><p>TO SEE HIM IN RECENT MONTHS.  PAUL COMMENTED THAT </p><p>PRABHAKARAN AND PRESIDENT JAYEWARDENE SHARE AT LEAST </p><p>ONE WEAKNESS:  "THEY BOTH SUFFER FROM ISOLATION FROM </p><p>THEIR PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>PRABHAKARAN AND NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  PRABHAKARAN REMAINS ABSOLUTELY UNBENDING IN HIS </p><p>DEMAND FOR EELAM.  PAUL SAID THAT MANY IN THE LTTE </p><p>HIERARCHY, INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY KITTU AND RAHIM, </p><p>WOULD PROBABLY AGREE TO A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT AS </p><p>LONG AS IT INCLUDED THE CONCEPT OF A TAMIL "HOMELAND." </p><p>BUT PRABHAKARAN WOULD NOT AGREE TO NEGOTIATIONS UNDER </p><p>ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND HIS IS THE ONLY LTTE VIEW WHICH </p><p>MATTERS.  HIS ANTIPATHY TO NEGOTIATIONS EXTENDS TO </p><p>REFUSING EVEN SECRET, INDIRECT CONTACTS WITH THE GSL: </p><p>ACCORDING TO PAUL, PRABHAKARAN THIS SPRING REFUSED </p><p>TO SEE THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE SATURDAY REVIEW </p><p>(GAMINI NAVARATNA, ONE OF THE RELATIVELY FEW SINHALESE </p><p>LIVING IN JAFFNA) EVEN KNOWING THAT NAVARATNA HAD BEEN </p><p>ASKED BY THE PRESIDENT TO DELIVER A  MESSAGE TO HIM </p><p>ON J. R.\'S  BEHALF.  PAUL APPEARED TO BELIEVE THAT A </p><p>WAY WOULD HAVE TO BE FOUND TO REMOVE PRABHAKARAN FROM </p><p>THE SCENE IF THERE WERE TO BE ANY HOPE FOR A NEGOTIATED </p><p>SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN </p><p></p></div>
