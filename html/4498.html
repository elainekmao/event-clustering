The nominees </p><p>are senior judges of the Court of Appeal who are </p><p>likely to be promoted to the Supreme Court of Sri </p><p>Lanka in the very near future.   This project is </p><p>keeping with the broad Mission Program Plan Goal of </p><p>\'Supporting human rights, democracy and the rule of </p><p>law in Sri Lanka.\'  It also supports \'Improving </p><p>understanding of U.S. policy and its underlying </p><p>context.\'  Post objectives in proposing this project </p><p>are to: </p><p>-- provide better qualified and knowledgeable judges </p><p>to serve justice without delay, thus enhancing the </p><p>faith of Sri Lankan citizens in the judicial system </p><p>and strengthening an independent judiciary as a key </p><p>element of democracy; </p><p>-- Ensure that the rule of law as practiced in the </p><p>U.S. is better understood by key members of the </p><p>judicial branch in Sri Lanka, encouraging them to </p><p>apply positive lessons learned from their U.S. </p><p>experience  in administering justice in Sri Lanka; </p><p>-- provide speedier relief to victims of human </p><p>rights violations, political prisoners, detainees, </p><p>families of the disappeared and torture victims </p><p>through more efficient court system. </p><p>The two candidates nominated for this program are </p><p>well qualified both to participate fully in program </p><p>activities and to implement lessons learned upon </p><p>their return to Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>END MEMO POST-OBJ: </p><p>START MEMO POST-RCMD: </p><p>The two judges nominated are judges of the Court of </p><p>Appeal of Sri Lanka with wide experience in the </p><p>judicial system in Sri Lanka.  However, they have </p><p>not had any exposure to the U.S. judicial system or </p><p>to the American society.  Therefore,  the program </p><p>should focus on the structure and function of the </p><p>American judicial system, including its federal </p><p>nature and its role in protecting human rights.  The </p><p>participants should gain exposure to the use of </p><p>modern information technologies in administration of </p><p>the judicial system, caseload management and the </p><p>training of judges to adapt to new technology.  The </p><p>program should also be designated to deepen their </p><p>understanding of court administration in particular </p><p>and the criminal justice system in general. </p><p>END MEMO POST-RCMD: </p><p>USIA-OFFICE-ID: 1039 </p><p>PROG-AGENCY-ID: </p><p>PROJ-TYPE-ID: SCP </p><p>PROG-TYPE-ID: 29 </p><p>NOMINATING-POST-ID: 2929 </p><p>FUNDING-CNTRY-ID: </p><p>STATUS: N </p><p>ORIGINATOR: P </p><p>SUBJ-DISC: Administration of Justice </p><p> </p><p>3A.
