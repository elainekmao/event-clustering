<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000201 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UN SPECIAL ENVOY MORRIS IN THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Zimbabwe\'s government-owned "Herald" newspaper </p><p>      attempted to twist comments made by UN Special Envoy for </p><p>      Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa James Morris after </p><p>      his January 24 meeting with President Mugabe in Harare. </p><p>      The front page of the January 25 "Herald" informed readers </p><p>      that Morris "accepted the irreversibility of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>      land reform program."  Because the independent press are </p><p>      excluded from State House where Morris spoke to media after </p><p>      his meeting with Mugabe, that gross distortion might have </p><p>      stood, but Morris used his January 25 pre-departure press </p><p>      conference to set the record straight.  His frank criticism </p><p>      of the "Herald\'s" politically motivated distortion provided </p><p>      a choice lead in the January 27 "Standard," a privately </p><p>      owned weekly.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Help new farmers: U.N. special </p><p>      envoy" the "Herald" (01/25) carried the following </p><p>      lead story: </p><p> </p><p>      "Humanitarian agencies working in Zimbabwe should </p><p>      help provide farmers with water and inputs, visiting </p><p>      U.N. special envoy Mr. Tim (sic) Morris said </p><p>      yesterday, accepting the irreversibility of land </p><p>      reform in essence.  This help to farmers was </p><p>      necessary, in addition to providing immediate food </p><p>      aid to those in need of assistance.  `We need to work </p><p>      very hard to provide people with water, fertilizers </p><p>      and inputs. . .,\' he told journalists soon after </p><p>      meeting President Mugabe at State House.  `Food is </p><p>      only a piece of it.  In a drought, the provision of </p><p>      water is very important.\'  Mr. Morris said the </p><p>      provision of water, fertilizers and other </p><p>      agricultural inputs would enhance the capacity of the </p><p>      famine stricken families to feed themselves.  The </p><p>      U.N. official expressed optimism and satisfaction </p><p>      with food distribution mechanisms and the efforts </p><p>      being undertaken by the government to deal with the </p><p>      HIV/AIDs scourge. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Herald lied 100 (percent), says U.N. </p><p>      envoy" the independent weekly "The Standard" (01/26) </p><p>      carried the following article by Henry Makiwa: </p><p> </p><p>      "James Morris, the U.N. special envoy for </p><p>      Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa, yesterday </p><p>      dressed down the state-controlled daily, The Herald, </p><p>      saying it had peddled `100 (percent) lies,\' in </p><p>      yesterday\'s front-page lead story.  Morris who says </p><p>      his deep-seated concern for the humanitarian crisis </p><p>      in Zimbabwe should be accurately reflected, told </p><p>      journalists, diplomats and government officials at a </p><p>      press conference, that he was shocked to see `The </p><p>      Herald\' publish a story purporting that he had </p><p>      accepted the irreversibility of the land reform </p><p>      exercise. . .  Morris said The Herald\'s lead </p><p>      story. . .constituted a gross misrepresentation of </p><p>      what he had said when addressing journalists on </p><p>      Friday afternoon. . .  Said Morris yesterday: `The </p><p>      comments in `The Herald\' were 100 (percent) lies.  I </p><p>      did not comment as `The Herald\' purportedly reports </p><p>      in its front-page story today. . .  I did not accept </p><p>      that the land reform process was irreversible as </p><p>      they quote me as saying.  It was gross </p><p>      misrepresentation of the worst form.  `What I did </p><p>      say was that the future of Zimbabwe depended on the </p><p>      success of a robust agro-based economy.  It was also </p><p>      embarrassing that `The Herald\' repeatedly quoted me </p><p>      as `Tim Morris\' when my real name is James Morris. </p><p>      Ironically, I have a 36-year-old son called Tim who </p><p>      will probably be attributed to The Herald\'s </p><p>      utterances, not myself!\' Morris said. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
