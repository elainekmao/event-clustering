BELGRADE 740 </p><p>     B. LJUBLJANA 344 </p><p>     C. SKOPJE 423 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: NICHOLAS HILL, POLITICAL ECONOMIC COUNSELOR, FOR REASONS </p><p> 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C) SUMMARY: FOR CROATIA, UNRAVELING THE LIABILITIES AND </p><p>ASSETS OF THE SUCCESSOR STATES OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA </p><p>CONTINUES TO HINGE ON SECURING A RATIFIED AGREEMENT ON </p><p>SUCCESSION ISSUES (ASI).  ON APRIL 4, ZDRAVKO ROGIC, SENIOR </p><p>CROATIAN REPRESENTATIVE ON THE SUCCESSOR STATES\' FINANCE </p><p>COMMITTEE, REPEATED WHAT HE AND OTHERS IN THE GOC HAVE SAID </p><p>TO US ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ALREADY: EVEN IF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WANTED TO, IT COULD NOT PROVIDE A HOLD HARMLESS TO ENABLE </p><p>DISPERSAL OF NBY ASSETS TO SUCCESSOR STATES BY THE APRIL 15 </p><p>U.S.-IMPOSED DEADLINE BEFORE OFAC PROCEEDS WITH A GENERAL </p><p>UNBLOCKING.  CROATIA WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BLOCKED NBY ASSETS </p><p>DISPERSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER AN ASI IS RATIFIED, ROGIC </p><p>CONTINUED, BUT A HOLD HARMLESS WOULD BE A LEGAL </p><p>"IMPOSSIBILITY."  MOREOVER, HE SAID, DEALS WORKED OUT WITH </p><p>THIRD COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ONE SIGNED WITH RUSSIA LAST WEEK, </p><p>ARE PREDICATED ON HAVING A RATIFIED SUCCESSION AGREEMENT.  NO </p><p>DISPURSEMENTS COULD BE MADE BY MOSCOW UNTIL CROATIA RATIFIES </p><p>THE ASI. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>HOLD HARMLESS IMPOSSIBLE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) ZDRAVKO ROGIC, DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF THE CROATIAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00755  01 OF 02  042043Z </p><p>CENTRAL BANK AND THE GOC\'S REPRESENTATIVE ON THE SUCCESSOR </p><p>STATES\' FINANCIAL COMMITTEE, WAS IN FAMILIAR FORM DURING A </p><p>MEETING APRIL 4.  HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM SKOPJE, WHERE THE </p><p>FINANCIAL COMMITTEE HAD JUST CONCLUDED A TOUGH SESSION. </p><p>ROGIC SAID CROATIA\'S STAND WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. REQUEST </p><p>FOR A HOLD HARMLESS TO ENABLE RELEASE OF FROZEN NBY ASSETS </p><p>REMAINED ABSOLUTELY UNCHANGED.  HE REPEATED ALL THE ARGUMENTS </p><p>HE HAS MADE BEFORE, AND CLAIMED OTHER SUCCESSOR STATES </p><p>REMAINED UPSET ABOUT THE U.S. DECISION TO GO FORWARD WITH A </p><p>GENERAL UNBLOCKING ON APRIL 15 ABSENT A HOLD HARMLESS.  THE </p><p>U.S., PERHAPS THE WORLD\'S "MOST LEGALISTIC STATE," HE SAID, </p><p>WANTS TO PUSH FORWARD HERE IN A NON-LEGAL FASHION TO UNBLOCK </p><p>EVEN THOUGH CROATIA HAS NOT RATIFIED THE ASI.  THE U.S. WANTS </p><p>THE GOC TO PROVIDE A HOLD HARMLESS EVEN THOUGH, BY PROVIDING </p><p>IT, THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD BE USURPING THE AUTHORITY </p><p>OF THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) ROGIC REPEATED POINTS HE AND COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE ON </p><p>MANY OCCASIONS TO US, IN PARTICULAR THAT AUTHORITIES IN </p><p>BELGRADE CONTINUE TO REFUSE THE CROATIANS AND OTHER SUCCESSOR </p><p>STATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE BOOKS OF THE NBY TO </p><p>FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO $589 MILLION THAT HAD GONE MISSING </p><p>FROM JOINT VENTURE BANKS.  "WE NEED YOUR HELP IN TRACKING </p><p>DOWN THIS MONEY," HE REPEATED.  WHY DO AUTHORITIES IN </p><p>BELGRADE REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH US?  "IT\'S IN THEIR </p><p>INTEREST TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS" BECAUSE THE MONEY MOST </p><p>LIKELY WAS STOLEN BY MILOSEVIC\'S PEOPLE.  ROGIC SAID AGAIN </p><p>THAT CROATIA DOES NOT WANT COMPENSATION FOR THE MISSING MONEY </p><p>-- IN THE FORM OF AN ALTERED KEY OR ANY OTHER WAY -- BUT </p><p>MERELY WANTED A FULL ACCOUNTING THAT WOULD ENABLE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO SUBMIT THE ASI TO THE PARLIAMENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00755  01 OF 02  042043Z </p><p> </p><p>RUSSIAN DEBT: NOT SO FAST </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C) WE ASKED ROGIC ABOUT THE DEAL WORKED OUT IN MOSCOW </p><p>OVER THE RUSSIAN DEBT (REF A), AND IN PARTICULAR WHETHER IN </p><p>USING THE ASI KEY THE CROATIANS HAD ADOPTED A DOUBLE </p><p>STANDARD.  THE KEY, UNDER WHICH CROATIA GETS 23 PERCENT OF </p><p>ANY PAYOFF TO SFRY SUCCESSOR STATES, WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO BE </p><p>USED FOR DISBURSING RUSSIAN DEBTS BUT NOT FOR DISBURSING </p><p>BLOCKED NBY MONEY.  ROGIC POINTED OUT RATHER EMPHATICALLY </p><p>THAT THE DEAL BROKERED IN MOSCOW IS PREDICATED ON THE VIENNA </p><p>ASI COMING INTO FULL FORCE.  BEFORE ANY MONEY COULD BE </p><p>DISBURSED, HE STRESSED, ALL SUCCESSOR STATES WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>RATIFY THE VIENNA AGREEMENT.  ASKED IF HE EXPECTED MOSCOW, A </p><p>HISTORICAL FRIEND OF BELGRADE\'S, TO HOLD UP DISBURSING MONEY </p><p>TO SERBIA UNTIL CROATIA RATIFIED THE ASI, ROGIC SAID </p><p>"ABSOLUTELY."  AND IF RUSSIA DISBURSES THE MONEY BEFORE THE </p><p>ASI COMES INTO EFFECT, ROGIC SAID HE EXPECTED THE U.S., AS A </p><p>STATE RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW, TO SUPPORT THE CROATIAN </p><p>POSITION -- ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SAY HOW. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8080 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00755  02 OF 02  042044Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------50BE84  042044Z /45 </p><p>O 041555Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9886 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NICOSIA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000755 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/12/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, MK, SR, BK, SI, MW, HR, RU </p><p>SUBJECT: UNBLOCKING SFRY ASSETS: CROATIA MAINTAINS HARD </p><p>LINE, INCLUDING ON RUSSIAN DEBT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00755  02 OF 02  042044Z </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.   (C) ROGIC CAME ACROSS AS CLEARLY FRUSTRATED.  HE </p><p>CONTINUES TO SAY (OVER AND OVER AGAIN) THAT HE CANNOT </p><p>UNDERSTAND WHY THE U.S. IS PUSHING SO HARD TO DISBURSE THE </p><p>MONEY FROZEN UNDER THE SERBIA SANCTIONS PROGRAM -- ALTHOUGH </p><p>HE RETURNED TO AN ACCUSATION MADE MONTHS AGO THAT THIS </p><p>INITIATIVE IS ALL ABOUT A PROMISE THE SECRETARY MADE TO </p><p>BELGRADE AUTHORITIES LAST YEAR TO RETURN FROZEN ASSETS TO </p><p>THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS.  EVEN IF ROGIC\'S RESPONSE ABOUT THE </p><p>HOLD HARMLESS REMAINS UNCHANGED, HE SOUNDED MORE CONCILIATORY </p><p>CONCERNING COMPENSATION.  HE KNOWS THAT THE $589 MILLION THAT </p><p>WENT MISSING AFTER THE ASI WAS SIGNED WAS PROBABLY STOLEN BY </p><p>MILOSEVIC AND HIS CRONIES YEARS AGO.  AS SUCH, CROATIA IS NOT </p><p>ASKING FOR COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF A HIGHER PERCENTAGE IN </p><p>THE KEY OR ANYTHING ELSE.  BUT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SEND </p><p>AN ASI TO THE PARLIAMENT THAT REFLECTS REALITY -- OR SO HE </p><p>ASSERTED TO US. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) WHEN ROGIC INSISTS THAT NONE OF THE RUSSIAN DEBT </p><p>COULD BE DISBURSED UNTIL THE ASI ENTERED INTO EFFECT, WE </p><p>PRESUME HE IS REFERRING TO LANGUAGE IN ARTICLE 8 OF THE </p><p>MEMORANDUM BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE SFRY </p><p>SUCCESSOR STATES.  THAT SAYS THAT THE DEAL SHALL COME INTO </p><p>FORCE AFTER "ALL THE REQUIRED INTRA-STATE AND INTER-STATE </p><p>PROCEDURES" HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN.  IT IS UNCLEAR IF ROGIC </p><p>REALLY BELIEVES THAT RUSSIA -- WHICH HE COMPLAINED SHOWED </p><p>BIAS IN MOSCOW TOWARD THE BELGRADE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS -- WILL DUTIFULLY WAIT FOR THE CROATIAN </p><p>PARLIAMENT TO RATIFY THE ASI BEFORE DISBURSING ANY OF ITS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00755  02 OF 02  042044Z </p><p>DEBTS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, ROGIC\'S COMMENTS INDICATED THAT AN </p><p>ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN MOSCOW AND </p><p>THE SUCCESSOR STATES REMAINS OVER SETTLING ACCOUNTS, AND </p><p>MOSCOW MAY NOT BE IN SUCH A RUSH TO HONOR DEBTS IF IT HAS A </p><p>GOOD EXCUSE TO SIT ON ITS HANDS. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
