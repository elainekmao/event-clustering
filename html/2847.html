(C) SUMMARY: PolMilOff met on April 9 with Egyptian First </p><p>Secretary Gamal Metwally for a read-out on the NEPAD meeting </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>in Abuja March 26.  While the achievements of the young </p><p>organization have been more rhetorical than real, some </p><p>progress has thus far apparently been achieved in defining </p><p>the group\'s organizational structure and in refining the </p><p>various mandates that will ultimately be NEPAD\'s task to </p><p>fulfill.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========= </p><p>STRUCTURE </p><p>========= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Organizationally, NEPAD consists of three main bodies, </p><p>the NEPAD Secretariat, a Steering Committee and an </p><p>Implementation Committee.  The Secretariat (www.nepad.org) is </p><p>based in Pretoria, and logistical support for the </p><p>Secretariat\'s operations is the responsibility of the SAG. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>The Steering Committee is composed of five countries (Egypt, </p><p>Algeria, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa).  Each member of </p><p>this quintet has been tasked with developing policy papers </p><p>and proposals on various aspects of NEPAD\'s development </p><p>mandate: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Egypt: Market Access, Diversification of Products and </p><p>Agriculture </p><p>--Algeria: Human Development (education, health, etc.) </p><p>--Nigeria: Economic Governance and Capital Flows </p><p>--Senegal: Infrastructure (energy, IT, etc.) </p><p>--South Africa: Political Governance: Peace, Security and </p><p>Democracy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Fifteen countries comprise the Implementation </p><p>Committee; three from each of the five African sub-regions </p><p>(as decided by the Lusaka Summit in July 2001).  This </p><p>Committee is responsible for reviewing and making </p><p>recommendations based upon the papers by the Steering </p><p>Committee.  The breakdown is as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-NORTH AFRICA: Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia </p><p>-EAST AFRICA: Ethiopia, Mauritius and Rwanda </p><p>-WEST AFRICA: Nigeria, Senegal and Mali </p><p>-CENTRAL AFRICA: Cameroon, Gabon and Congo </p><p>-SOUTHERN AFRICA: South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition to holding a separate Implementation Committee </p><p>gathering on the margins of the Dakar Private Sector NEPAD </p><p>Meeting (15-17 April), the Committee plans to conduct similar </p><p>sidebars at the Rome World Food Summit (10-13 June), the </p><p>Ottawa G-8 Meeting (26-28 June) and the Durban OAU Summit (8 </p><p>July). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: Ref B sparked some concern in Washington, </p><p>particularly the document listing Liberia, Libya and Sudan as </p><p>members of a Committee on Peace, Governance and Democracy </p><p>(Political Governance).  The Egyptian explained that the </p><p>groupings in reftel B were ad hoc formulations for the </p><p>meetings at the World Economic Forum in New York only.  While </p><p>the designation of the chairmen of the committees (i.e. South </p><p>Africa\'s Thabo Mbeki for Political Governance) is firm, the </p><p>rest of the committees\' membership remains a work in </p><p>progress.  Those that helped fill the Political Governance </p><p>Committee during the World Economic Forum will likely not be </p><p>replicated when NEPAD permanently fills the committee, </p><p>particularly those countries that have not participated in </p><p>any NEPAD deliberations thus far.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========== </p><p>HIGHLIGHTS </p><p>========== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Prior to the Summit, the Steering Committee met March </p><p>23, and agreed on the need for a code of standards on good </p><p>governance, human rights, democracy and freedom of </p><p>expression.  The group also agreed that they should propose </p><p>that the OAU/AU establish a special committee that would </p><p>undertake a peer review every three years, and would report </p><p>its findings and recommendations to NEPAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to the Egyptian diplomat, there were six </p><p>significant points raised at the Summit itself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Nigeria urged the attendees that NEPAD should rebuff any </p><p>donor attempts to interfere in African domestic affairs as a </p><p>precondition for supporting NEPAD (i.e. Zimbabwe). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b) The assembly agreed on the need for African civil society </p><p>to participate in the work of the Implementation Committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c) The attendees agreed to expand NEPAD to include </p><p>participation of all African countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d) They decided that NEPAD was not a new, independent </p><p>organization, but that it falls under the aegis of the OAU/AU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>e) The Summit identified as priority the need to develop an </p><p>assessment paper to distribute at the G-8 Summit explaining </p><p>the goals of NEPAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>f) Summiteers stressed the utility of regional and </p><p>sub-regional organizations\' participation in implementing the </p><p>NEPAD program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) During the Summit, Algerian President Bouteflika </p><p>proposed the establishment of an African Penal Court, which </p><p>will be discussed further at the OAU Summit in July in </p><p>Durban.  Additionally, Nigeria presented a draft declaration </p><p>on democracy and good governance, and requested the document </p><p>be endorsed by NEPAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Nigeria and other African states were somewhat rattled </p><p>by Washington\'s linkage of our support for NEPAD to African </p><p>Governments\' positions on the Zimbabwean election. As stated </p><p>to us by a Canadian diplomat reflecting on PM Chretien\'s </p><p>visit to Nigeria April 4-7, Obasanjo sees himself as one of </p><p>the good guys in Africa, and thus expects additional latitude </p><p>from his partners such as the United States when dealing with </p><p>African issues.  He also expects strong Western support for </p><p>NEPAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Egyptian diplomat confided that while African </p><p>leaders had a tradition of making grand statements while </p><p>doing little to implement their ideas, they now appeared to </p><p>understand the importance of doing the necessary but </p><p>difficult work of making NEPAD a reality. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
