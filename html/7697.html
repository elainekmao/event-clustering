<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002504 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, KPAO, OVIP, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  JORDAN TO HOST SPECIAL WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM </p><p>MEETING </p><p> </p><p>1.  Post received original letters from King Abdullah to </p><p>President Bush, NSA Rice, Secretary Powell, USTR </p><p>Zoellick, Administrator Natsios, and Senator John Kerry, </p><p>inviting them to participate in an extraordinary meeting </p><p>of the World Economic Forum (WEF) to be held in Jordan </p><p>June 21-23.  The theme of the meeting is "Aligning </p><p>Visions for a Shared Future."  Planning Minister Bassem </p><p>Awadallah, who is taking the lead in organizing the </p><p>government of Jordan for this event, said that the idea </p><p>was to have a peace summit in the wake of the liberation </p><p>of Iraq.  It would be different from the annual Davos </p><p>meetings in that the focus would be more on politics than </p><p>on economics, he said.  Awadallah also explained that the </p><p>overall list of invitees had been prepared by the WEF </p><p>secretariat, which had asked the King to help encourage </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>some specific high-level participants to attend. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Following is the text of the body of the King\'s </p><p>letter, which was identical for each of the six </p><p>recipients.  Post has faxed copies to NEA/ARN and will </p><p>also pouch the originals to NEA/ARN for distribution to </p><p>addressees. </p><p> </p><p>Begin text. </p><p> </p><p>On behalf of the 1,000 Chief Executives of the member </p><p>companies of The World Economic Forum, I am very pleased </p><p>to extend this personal invitation to join the world\'s </p><p>leadership for an Extraordinary Annual Meeting to be held </p><p>in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>From the 21st to the 23rd of June 2003, under the theme </p><p>of "Aligning Visions for a Shared Future," world leaders </p><p>from business, governments and civil society will rally </p><p>by the Dead Sea in Jordan for a comprehensive and top </p><p>level session devoted to boosting global cooperation in a </p><p>time of extreme volatility and economic uncertainty. </p><p> </p><p>Three major tracks will form the bulk of our agenda, </p><p>namely: </p><p> </p><p>   1.  The economic and development agenda of the Middle </p><p>       East; </p><p>   2.  The world\'s geo political situation; </p><p>   3.  The global business and economic agenda. </p><p> </p><p>Commitments to actively participate in the meeting at the </p><p>highest level have already been confirmed by numerous </p><p>government and business leaders worldwide.  This </p><p>Extraordinary Annual Meeting convenes the "Davos </p><p>Community" in an effort to boost a spirit of cooperation </p><p>rather than confrontation. </p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, the urgency of restoring confidence in our </p><p>common future and systems of global governance, the </p><p>imperative for world business and political leaders to </p><p>lead our citizens out of the current economic downturn, </p><p>increasing the fight against poverty, rebuilding and </p><p>stabilizing the Middle East all need our immediate </p><p>attention more than ever. </p><p> </p><p>Our discussions in Jordan will be followed by the world </p><p>media and should become a powerful symbol for renewing </p><p>our mutual commitments towards a peaceful Middle East and </p><p>global growth. </p><p> </p><p>I very much hope that we will have the pleasure of </p><p>welcoming you to Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
