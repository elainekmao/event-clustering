Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The day before the August 8 deadline for designated </p><p>farmers to leave their properties (reftel), a High Court </p><p>judge issued a ruling that could give a temporary reprieve to </p><p>affected farmers.  Judge Charles Hungwe ruled that the </p><p>government\'s acquisition of Tengwe Estates farm was "null and </p><p>void" because proper procedures had not been followed. </p><p>Specifically, the GOZ had failed to inform the National </p><p>Merchant Bank, holder of owner Andrew Kockett\'s mortgage, of </p><p>the acquisition, as required by the Land Acquisition Act. </p><p>Kockett\'s attorney, Ray Barreto, told us that only his client </p><p>had been served an acquisition notice.  Barreto surmised that </p><p>the Government may not make its usual waves over this </p><p>decision, as his client is currently growing winter wheat, a </p><p>commodity soon expected to be in very short supply. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Comment: An ex-combatant in Zimbabwe\'s liberation war </p><p>and recent appointee to the High Court, Hungwe disapproves of </p><p>the use to which war veterans have been put and is considered </p><p>one of the more independent thinkers on the bench.  President </p><p>Mugabe\'s recent comments on the judiciary (ref B) do not </p><p>inspire confidence that Hungwe\'s decision will be honored. </p><p>That said, the GOZ has tried to appear to act consistent with </p><p>its own laws, and the failure to notify financial </p><p>institutions holding the mortgages of designated commercial </p><p>farms is a clear violation of the Land Acquisition Act. </p><p>Hungwe\'s ruling could encourage other farmers to file suit, </p><p>but it is unclear how many of them are in a similar position. </p><p> The GOZ has three principal response options.  It can ignore </p><p>the ruling, but doing so removes the thin veneer of legality </p><p>which currently envelops the fast track effort.  It can </p><p>appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, now firmly in ZANU-PF </p><p>hands, but Hungwe appears to be on very solid legal ground. </p><p>Third, it can comply with Hungwe\'s ruling and begin the </p><p>acquisition process anew, which merely will delay the </p><p>government\'s acquisition of designated land.  Hungwe\'s </p><p>decision, therefore, has at best bought designated farmers a </p><p>bit of extra time. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Meanwhile, another case working its way through the </p><p>courts could have an impact on the GOZ\'s resettlement </p><p>program.  On July 4, High Court Judge Benjamin Paradza issued </p><p>a provisional order that the acquisition of Nyalugwe Farm, </p><p>owned by George Quinnell, was invalid.  According to Paradza, </p><p>the holder of the mortgage had not been notified and </p><p>Agriculture Minister Joseph Made, who signed the acquisition </p><p>notice, ceased to be a government minister in legal terms on </p><p>April 1.  The basis of his interpretation regarding Made is </p><p>section 31 (e) of the constitution, which states that the </p><p>"office of Vice-President, Minister, or Deputy Minister shall </p><p>become vacant upon the assumption of office of a new </p><p>President."  The opposition MDC and independent press have </p><p>used that provision to maintain that President Mugabe\'s </p><p>current cabinet has no legal standing, since all of its </p><p>members held their positions prior to the March presidential </p><p>election and have not since been reappointed.  However, </p><p>Quinnell\'s lawyer, Ray Passaportis, told us that the issue of </p><p>whether Mugabe meets the definition of "new president" is </p><p>clearly open to interpretation.  Paradza has solicited and </p><p>recently received a written GOZ response to his provisional </p><p>order and has given the plaintiff a chance to submit a </p><p>rebuttal. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: A decision by Paradza to uphold his earlier </p><p>ruling would likely have little practical effect, as </p><p>Government would certainly ignore the part of his judgment </p><p>stating that the current Cabinet has no legal standing.  For </p><p>the reasons explained in para 2, however, the element </p><p>relating to failure to notify mortgage holders would be more </p><p>difficult for the GOZ to dismiss out of hand. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
