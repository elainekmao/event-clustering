<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001314 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR AA/AFR CONSTANCE NEWMAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, PINS, EPET, PREL, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AID ASST. ADMINISTRATOR\'S DELTA VISIT </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) USAID Assistant Administrator Constance Newman </p><p>visited the violence-plagued Warri area July 17.  Accompanied </p><p>by USAID Mission Director and Corporate Responsibility </p><p>Officer (CRO), Newman received a briefing on security, </p><p>community relations and community development from Shell\'s </p><p>General Manager for Production and its regional Manager for </p><p>Community Relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) The Shell officials described their often turbulent </p><p>relations with communities in the riverine areas of Delta </p><p>State.  The company seeks "host community" relationships with </p><p>villages in the immediate vicinity of Shell installations and </p><p>pipelines.  MOUs signed with the communities govern the </p><p>provision of community development assistance.  In the past, </p><p>assistance was focused on tangibles such as wells, school </p><p>buildings and clinics.  Shell is now reorienting its </p><p>community development program to focus on human capital -- </p><p>through training, scholarships and job creation.  Recognizing </p><p>that its staff is not well  skilled at designing and </p><p>implementing sustainable assistance programs, Shell is also </p><p>seeking to out-source a large portion of its assistance. </p><p>Development agencies and organizations such as  USAID, DFID </p><p>and the World Bank will be sought as partners in </p><p>collaborative assistance efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) During a helicopter overflight of the Warri "creeks," </p><p>Newman was shown closed facilities, including a Shell </p><p>logistics center completely destroyed by armed Ijaw </p><p>militants.  She also saw the ruins of two Itsekiri villages </p><p>destroyed during the March Ijaw attacks.  With the exception </p><p>of the huge Chevron terminal and tank farm at Escravos, the </p><p>area remains off-limits to oil company personnel because of </p><p>the lack of security.  Flying over Warri\'s harbor, the group </p><p>saw one of the two USG-donated buoy tenders at berth and </p><p>could identify a weapon mounted on the boat\'s stern. (Note: </p><p>Photos of the boat have been passed to Post\'s DAO. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) In a meeting with Warri-area Ijaw leaders the AID A/A </p><p>heard complaints about the underdevelopment of Ijaw areas in </p><p>the Delta.  Basic amenities such as clean water, roads and </p><p>schools are needed, claimed Ijaw national leader Chief Edwin </p><p>Clark.  Despite the enormous wealth produced by the region, </p><p>villages remained isolated and development assistance has </p><p>been meager.  Leaders of the Ijaw militants -- the Federated </p><p>Niger Delta Ijaw Communities (FNDIC) -- presented a more </p><p>strident message.  Although the Ijaw leaders found fault with </p><p>the Niger Delta Development Commission -- the federal </p><p>government\'s vehicle for recycling a portion of  oil </p><p>dividends to the communities -- they reserved their harshest </p><p>criticism for the oil industry.  They called for a larger </p><p>allocation of development resources to Ijaw communities. </p><p>realignment of resources provided by the oil companies, to a </p><p>more equitable sharing with Ijaw communities.  The militants </p><p>particularly faulted ChevronTexaco for allegedly favoring </p><p>Itsekiris with the company\'s development dollars. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) AA Newman\'s schedule prevented her from meeting </p><p>Itsekiri leaders, but the AID Mission Director and CRO met in </p><p>Sapele (about 40 kilometers from Warri) with leaders of </p><p>Itsekiri communities displaced from the Warri creeks. </p><p>Itsekiri leaders also complained about insufficient </p><p>development assistance.  In a prophetic note, the Itsekiri </p><p>National Youth Council leader warned that Itsekiri youth were </p><p>preparing to fight.  No longer would they "stand with their </p><p>arms folded" while the Ijaw attacked and destroyed their </p><p>villages; they would respond in kind to the next Ijaw </p><p>provocation.  (Note: A July 24 Ijaw attack on the Itsekiri </p><p>village of Abi-Gborodo in Warri North Local Government Area </p><p>was met by a reprisal attack by the Itsekiri youth the </p><p>following day -- the first time the Itsekiri have used force </p><p>in this crisis that began in March. End Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) Comment:  The visit served to highlight the </p><p>complexity of the current Warri situation.  It is an ethnic, </p><p>emotional and economic conundrum that will require deft </p><p>handling to minimize.   Tribalism,  ethnic animosities, and </p><p>frustration over lack of economic opportunities have grown. </p><p>Groups compete against each other for this portion of meager </p><p>local resources as well as contest each other for the </p><p>attention of the only functioning authority seen in the area </p><p>-- the oil companies.  Attempts at political settlements will </p><p>mostly likely fail as they do not address the core economic </p><p>grievances of the ethnic groups involved.  Conflict </p><p>mitigation work and development assistance aimed at the </p><p>micro-level has a greater chance of success. For this reason, </p><p>USAID has assigned a priority to projects addressing conflict </p><p>in the Delta, through public-private partnerships with the </p><p>companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) As part of its new five-year strategy (2004-2009) </p><p>USAID has commissioned an assessment of the southern region </p><p>of Nigeria, with a focus on the Delta.  USAID has engaged in </p><p>numerous discussions with the oil companies regarding current </p><p>and future partnerships aimed at economic growth and </p><p>community development.  USAID will use the southern </p><p>assessment to help guide its future investments in the Delta </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(U) Post was not able to clear this cable with AA Newman </p><p>before her departure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
