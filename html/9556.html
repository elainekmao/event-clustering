<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 004491 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ETRD, PINR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PM AND CABINET RESIGN; MINOR RESHUFFLE IN THE WORKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 04332 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA DAVID HALE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>AS EXPECTED...KING ASKS PM TO FORM NEW CABINET </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) PM Abul Ragheb on July 19 submitted the resignation of </p><p>his cabinet.  King Abdullah on July 20 asked him to form a </p><p>new Cabinet.  In a conversation with the Ambassador on July </p><p>13 (see Reftel), the King said this reshuffle would be minor </p><p>and entail the change of just a few ministers.  New Lower </p><p>House Speaker Srour told the Charge on July 21 that he had </p><p>consulted with the PM on the new government.  The PM told him </p><p>the new cabinet would have only 4-5 changes (per reftel, the </p><p>King has in mind an even lower number).  The PM can submit </p><p>the new government to Parliament for approval within 30 days; </p><p>and there is speculation he will do so within a day or two. </p><p>Srour expected 4-5 days of floor debate in the Lower House </p><p>before a vote. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>FEW CHANGES EXPECTED </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to Srour, the PM said he would split the </p><p>Tourism and Transport portfolios--currently headed by one </p><p>minister.  A trade contact told Econoff that Finance Minister </p><p>Secretary General Mohammad Abu Hammour will replace Trade </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Minister Saleh al-Bashir.  According to a senior official at </p><p>the Ministry of Information, Nabil al-Sharif, editor of the </p><p>Arabic daily al-Dustour, will become the new Information </p><p>Minister.  The Jordan Times reported on July 21 that Foreign </p><p>Minister Muasher, Justice Minister Faris Nabulsi, Finance </p><p>Minister Marto, Planning Minister Awadullah, and Water and </p><p>Irrigation Minister Nasser would retain their Cabinet </p><p>positions.  The local Arabic press speculated that Mohammad </p><p>Halaiqa--who served previously as the Minister of National </p><p>Economy--might return as Deputy Prime Minister and that </p><p>Khalid Touqan, the current Minister of Education, might be </p><p>departing. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Post expects no policy shifts to result from the </p><p>reshuffle and only a small number of relatively minor Cabinet </p><p>positions to change hands. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
