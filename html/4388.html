<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008447 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S EMERGENCY RULE REGION (OHAL): A LEOPARD </p><p>CAN\'T CHANGE ITS SPOTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 10/10 HANISH/SILVERMAN E-MAILS </p><p>     B. 10/3 HANISH/KAPLAN E-MAILS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Consul Greta C. Holtz for reasons 1.5 (b) & (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This cable was drafted by Consulate Adana. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) SUMMARY: Both government officials and NGO leaders </p><p>agree that, throughout the Southeast, the de jure shrinking </p><p>of the area under emergency rule (OHAL) has not measurably </p><p>changed security conditions or quality of life.  GOT and NGO </p><p>representatives have radically different opinions as to </p><p>whether this is good or bad.  Look for OHAL, under the </p><p>leadership of Governor Gokhan Aydiner, to continue under a </p><p>new name.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>QUOTH THE GOVERNOR: &NOTHING,S CHANGED8 </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Travelling to Turkey\'s most southeastern province of </p><p>Hakkari through a multitude of checkpoints, one has a hard </p><p>time believing that the past state of emergency has been </p><p>ended, or even relaxed.  In the two-hour drive between the </p><p>Hakkari-Sirnak provincial border, Poloff was stopped at </p><p>checkpoints no less than five times (contrasted with three </p><p>checkpoints in Diyarbakir province, still under OHAL rule, </p><p>over a similar distance).  Upon arrival, Poloff met with </p><p>three of Hakkari,s six deputy governors.  When asked what </p><p>had changed since OHAL ended, all three immediately said </p><p>&nothing.8  Elaborating, deputy governor Adem Aslan </p><p>asserted, &There were no problems under OHAL, and citizens </p><p>enjoyed all their freedoms at that time.  This has not </p><p>changed.8  Such dissembling about of security restrictions </p><p>echoed what Sirnak deputy governor Ugur Bulut had said in a </p><p>previous meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) In fact, OHAL Governor Aydiner seems to carry much </p><p>administrative power throughout the Southeast, regardless of </p><p>the fact that only Diyarbakir and Sirnak provinces remain </p><p>under OHAL.  In a copy of correspondence marked "secret" and </p><p>dated October 11 which the Diyarbakir Human Rights </p><p>Association (strictly protect) passed to Poloff, Aydiner </p><p>ordered the Van Governor (who is not under his jurisdiction), </p><p>along with 11 other governors, to warn, arrest, and punish </p><p>any members of KESK (the State employee,s union) who take </p><p>part in work stoppages or slowdowns.  The memo is a clear </p><p>order to the other governors, referring to the OHAL </p><p>administration as &Bolge Valiligimiz8 (&Our Region </p><p>Governorate8).  Apparently, the OHAL governor continues to </p><p>retain considerable informal control over security issues in </p><p>&adjacent provinces,8 a term used to describe all of the </p><p>former OHAL domain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>REAPING THE WHIRLWIND </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) One continuing troublesome issue throughout the </p><p>current and former OHAL area is the village guards.  These </p><p>villagers, deputized and armed by the jandarma, under the </p><p>auspices of provincial governors, offices, have proved as </p><p>much a cost as a benefit.  The conflict in the Southeast has </p><p>given way to tribal and land-ownership squabbles, now with </p><p>one party bearing arms, and often making use of them against </p><p>their neighbors.  In an October 18 meeting, Diyarbakir deputy </p><p>governor Husaiyn Nail Atay told Poloff village guards could </p><p>only be removed by attrition (death or migration out of the </p><p>Southeast).  Unfortunately, the guards are totally unwilling </p><p>to disarm, Atay said as he recalled an old saying that &a </p><p>Turk will never give up a woman, a horse, or a weapon.8  In </p><p>any case, OHAL Governor Aydiner recently said that he has no </p><p>plans to disarm or disband the village guards, which may </p><p>number up to 90,000.  (Turkish Daily News interview, October </p><p>31, 2002) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>QUOTH THE NGO,S: &NOTHING,S CHANGED8 </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) The Diyarbakir Human Rights Foundation (HRF), which </p><p>specializes in the treatment and documentation of torture, </p><p>provided Poloff with a summary of reported cases of torture </p><p>in Diyarbakir (one of two remaining OHAL provinces) this </p><p>year.  From January to September, 2002, 144 cases were </p><p>reported (109 men, 25 women, and 10 children).  June and July </p><p>had the largest number of reported cases, with 22 people for </p><p>each month.  HRF officials acknowledge that this represents a </p><p>slight decrease on reported cases of torture compared to last </p><p>year. However, they say there has been an increase in </p><p>less-detectable means of torture (such as use of water, </p><p>exposure to cold temperatures, or beating with sandbags </p><p>rather than fists), which may counter-balance the drop in </p><p>reported cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Also, the HRF argues, no changes have been made in </p><p>governmental and judicial attitudes toward torture: policemen </p><p>accused of torture are rarely convicted, while the alleged </p><p>victims are often brought up on charges of slander or </p><p>&defaming the state8 for leveling the charge.  Poloff </p><p>previously attended the trial of several young Kurdish women </p><p>in Istanbul who had been charged with &defaming the state8 </p><p>for saying police officers who had arrested them in the </p><p>Southeast had sexually molested them.  According to </p><p>Diyarbakir,s HRF and HRA, there is no appreciable difference </p><p>in practice between OHAL and non-OHAL districts, though the </p><p>likelihood of torture may change in a given area due to a </p><p>more or less humane commander. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Diyarbakir Human Rights Association (HRA) officials </p><p>were most concerned with continued threats and violence </p><p>directed at villagers from both jandarma and village guards. </p><p>Largely, they said, Kurdish villagers were being threatened </p><p>both within and outside the OHAL district not to vote for </p><p>DEHAP.  Also, they alleged security forces continue to </p><p>intentionally overlook abuses of power by village guards, as </p><p>in the Bismil-township case (reftel A). OHAL authorities and </p><p>the Diyarbakir HRA offer two different estimates of village </p><p>returnee numbers.  HRA believes 30,000-35,000 evacuees have </p><p>returned to their villages.  The governor\'s office says </p><p>51,000 people have returned to date.  HRA says the </p><p>discrepancy is due to the fact that OHAL may be counting </p><p>evacuees who return to the region (but not their own village) </p><p>as "returnees." (reftel B) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT: THE MORE THINGS CHANGE... </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S) OHAL Governor Aydiner,s brand of emergency rule in </p><p>the Southeast appears to have taken semi-permanent root. </p><p>Though the name may change on November 30, 2002 (when the </p><p>OHAL law expires), some form of &super-governorate8 has </p><p>been discussed in the Turkish press.  Aydiner,s attitude </p><p>toward the provincial governors in the Southeast, and the </p><p>persistence of tight security arrangements outside OHAL, </p><p>signal that a quasi-police state will continue in the region </p><p>for some time.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
