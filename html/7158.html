<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000587 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, PINR, PARM, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT KUMARATUNGA TELLS AMBASSADOR </p><p>COHABITATION ISN\'T WORKING; TIE-UP WITH LEFTIST JVP LIKELY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  I spent two hours 15 minutes with President </p><p>Kumaratunga on Saturday, April 5.  I didn\'t learn much.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  I met with President Chandrika Bandaranaike </p><p>Kumaratunga for two hours 15 minutes at her residence </p><p>Saturday afternoon, April 5.  She was attended by former </p><p>Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, while I was alone.  I </p><p>was supposed to meet with her the previous day.  But after </p><p>waiting 50 minutes beyond the appointed hour - a time she had </p><p>proposed, by the way - I got up and left.  A few minutes </p><p>later, she reached me on my cellphone, apologized in a </p><p>charming and disarming way and we rescheduled for the next </p><p>day. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  When I arrived on this occasion, I was surprised to </p><p>find her and Kadirgamar waiting for me.  They escorted me </p><p>from the reception area to the rear garden, where we sat </p><p>under one of the world\'s largest banyan trees.  We also sat </p><p>under a south Asian sun that would have blistered a barnacle, </p><p>and it did in the event blister my bald head.  CBK glowed, as </p><p>it were, in an outsized way, while Kadirgamar and I sweated. </p><p>So I was compensated in weight loss for a meeting that came </p><p>close to wasting my time. </p><p> </p><p>D\'S SPEECH </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  I asked whether she had seen the Deputy Secretary\'s </p><p>speech at the CSIS conference, and whether she had noted his </p><p>comments asserting the USG\'s conviction that she deserves </p><p>respect and inclusion in Sri Lanka\'s attempt at peace.  She </p><p>thanked him for the remarks but not with evident conviction. </p><p>It was as though this was her due and thus not so special. </p><p>One encounters this regal attitude in CBK often.  It is very </p><p>annoying. </p><p> </p><p>COHABITATION </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  She probably spent an hour discoursing on this </p><p>subject.  I began by stressing once again our belief that </p><p>cooperation between her party, the PA, and the UNP would </p><p>increase the odds of success in the peace negotiations.  Such </p><p>cooperation would surely get the LTTE\'s attention and make it </p><p>impossible for the Tigers to claim, as they now occasionally </p><p>do, that division between the PA and the UNP means that they </p><p>cannot be trusted to honor any deal with the Tamils.  In her </p><p>discursive, repetitive reply, she told me how she had been </p><p>mistreated by the Prime Minister, how her party cadre had </p><p>been abused by the UNP and thus, she concluded, she was now </p><p>completely lacking in trust in the government.  She did not </p><p>exclude the possibility of improving cohabitation, but she </p><p>said it was entirely up to the government to take the </p><p>initiative. </p><p> </p><p>PA-JVP ALLIANCE </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  After acknowledging that as a foreign diplomat, I of </p><p>course had no business venturing into Sri Lanka\'s internal </p><p>affairs, I proceeded to ask her whether she intended to do a </p><p>deal with the hard left JVP.  She admitted she hoped to but </p><p>said there were still a few "minor matters" to be sorted out. </p><p>In response to various queries from me, she said:  the JVP is </p><p>truly democratic (unlike the UNP and the LTTE); it has </p><p>accepted that the free market will prevail in Sri Lanka (I </p><p>said I doubted it, citing the JVP party leader\'s comment on a </p><p>TV show last week that his party embraced the Cuban model </p><p>(!)); it has agreed to a federal solution to Sri Lanka (again </p><p>I cited numerous public comments by JVP leaders that they </p><p>favor a unitary state with an unspecified amount of </p><p>devolution); and that it was less inclined to violence and </p><p>corruption than the PM\'s UNP (to the former assertion I </p><p>politely replied that the JVP had twice carried out armed </p><p>insurrections in Sri Lanka; to the latter, I said the JVP </p><p>might be less corrupt but that could be because it had never </p><p>held power).  Our disagreements on the JVP, as the foregoing </p><p>suggests, were frequent, but were expressed goodnaturedly. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>7. (C)  As I got up to leave, I asked her for her views on </p><p>our military action against Saddam\'s regime.  She said very </p><p>little in reply, her major point being that she wished we had </p><p>given inspections a chance.  (From various sources, we know </p><p>she embraces the French view utterly.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) This was CBK at her most aggravating.  She spoke </p><p>interminably and offered very little that she hadn\'t told me </p><p>several times before.  During her rambling riff on Ranil\'s </p><p>perfidy, I was reminded of a great put-down I once heard </p><p>about a player on my college baseball team:  does so-and-so, </p><p>one teammate mused, ever think anything that he doesn\'t say? </p><p>Sometimes, indeed, CBK seems to be speaking in the arrogant </p><p>manner of one who believes every thought she has is </p><p>expressible.  Earlier this week, I ran into John Hume, the </p><p>Irish Nobel laureate, who had just met CBK.  His assessment </p><p>of her was to the point:  "The woman is crazy, as </p><p>self-absorbed as any human being I\'ve ever met!"  I do not </p><p>think she is nuts because she frequently can be cogent but </p><p>she does seem occasionally to be diagonally parked across </p><p>sanity\'s border.  Perhaps that is understandable given the </p><p>personal tragedies she has endured in her life, most recently </p><p>her near-death experience with an LTTE suicide bomber. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Such news as there was in this meeting was not good. </p><p>Cohabitation is in bad repair and a deal between the PA and </p><p>the JVP looks likely.  The latter could be followed by a snap </p><p>election, which could set back peace talks for quite a while. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
