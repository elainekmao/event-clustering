Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Minister Moragoda (pls protect) has </p><p>provided us a copy of a long-awaited re the security </p><p>zones in Jaffna.  The report, which was written by a </p><p>retired Indian general, recommends that the GSL and </p><p>Tigers agree to mutual drawdowns of their military </p><p>positions.  In doing this, both sides would engage in </p><p>confidence-building measures facilitated by increased </p><p>monitoring.  While the report is fair-minded, the Tigers </p><p>-- who seem to want to keep this issue alive for </p><p>political reasons -- will probably balk at its </p><p>recommendations.  (Note:  Also see DATT\'s Septel review </p><p>of the report.)  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>============== </p><p>Nambiar Report </p><p>============== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On April 7, Milinda Moragoda (Amcit -- pls </p><p>protect), the Minister of Economic Reform and a key </p><p>player on peace process issues, provided the Ambassador </p><p>a (close-hold) copy of a long-awaited independent report </p><p>on the "high security zones" in Jaffna District. </p><p>Retired Indian General Satish Nambiar wrote the short, </p><p>complex report, which was sent to Department in Ref A. </p><p>Nambiar, who had been asked by the GSL to draw up the </p><p>report, had visited Sri Lanka earlier this year for </p><p>consultations and research on the controversial security </p><p>zones issue.  (Note:  Our understanding is that the </p><p>Indian government, while publicly taking a hands-off </p><p>posture regarding the report, paid Nambiar\'s salary and </p><p>expenses.)  According to Moragoda, the GSL continues to </p><p>review the report.  The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) have not yet seen it, but are scheduled to </p><p>receive a copy soon.  Nambiar is due to visit Sri Lanka </p><p>in late April to discuss the report with the government </p><p>and the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>Recommending Mutual Drawdowns </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The report acknowledges the importance of </p><p>assisting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in </p><p>returning to their home areas in Jaffna, including to </p><p>sites within the security zones.  To facilitate this, </p><p>the report\'s central conclusion is that the government </p><p>and the LTTE should engage in carefully calibrated and </p><p>mutual military drawdowns of their Jaffna-related </p><p>military positions. (Note:  The military\'s security </p><p>zones constitute approximately 18 percent of the land </p><p>size of Jaffna.  The LTTE only has military posts in a </p><p>sliver of Jaffna, but it has many cadre in Jaffna and a </p><p>strong military presence just south in the Wanni area.) </p><p>In making this recommendation, the report, in effect, </p><p>rejects the LTTE\'s long-standing view that the </p><p>government should unilaterally slash the size of its </p><p>security zones, so that the IDPs can return home </p><p>immediately.  (Note:  Per Ref B, about 270,000 IDPs have </p><p>already returned to their homes in the north/east.  Over </p><p>500,000 IDPs remain in the south.)  In light of the </p><p>LTTE\'s strong stand on this issue, the report admits </p><p>that agreement to the notion of mutual drawdowns will </p><p>have to be achieved by the two sides within the context </p><p>of the ongoing GSL-LTTE peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) If the LTTE agrees to (unspecified) drawdowns of </p><p>its own forces and at least some of the confidence- </p><p>building measures set out below, the report recommends </p><p>that the Sri Lankan military move forward and consider </p><p>drawdowns of its own positions in the following two </p><p>stages: </p><p>-- (A) The military would dismantle its "forward </p><p>positions" in areas near "Muhamalai, Nagarkovil, and the </p><p>promontories south of Chavakachcheri, along the beach </p><p>road south of Jaffna and along the coastal areas." </p><p>(Note:  The three areas named above are all in eastern </p><p>Jaffna and close to the GSL-LTTE Northern Forward </p><p>Defense Line, "FDL," on the Jaffna Isthmus.) </p><p> </p><p>-- (B) The security zones surrounding Palaly airbase, </p><p>Kankesanturai ("KKS") harbor, and Point Pedro harbor </p><p>would be "considered for reduction in size..." </p><p>(Note:  The area around Palaly airbase and KKS harbor </p><p>forms the largest of the security zones in Jaffna.  It </p><p>is where the government\'s Security Force Headquarters in </p><p>Jaffna is located.) </p><p>==================== </p><p>Increased Monitoring </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In moving toward military drawdowns, the report </p><p>recommends that both sides engage in confidence-building </p><p>measures facilitated by increased international </p><p>monitoring.  The report is not dispositive on what </p><p>organization would do such monitoring.  It recommends, </p><p>however, that the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring </p><p>Mission (SLMM) assume the responsibility, as it is </p><p>already in place monitoring the February 2002 ceasefire </p><p>agreement.  In order to do this, Nambiar states that the </p><p>SLMM should expand the size of its staff and be provided </p><p>more resources.  If the SLMM was to assume more </p><p>responsibility, consideration should be given to it </p><p>reporting to a "joint commission" that could include </p><p>"representatives from the major countries that agree to </p><p>provide the additional observers/monitors, and from some </p><p>of the major aid donors." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The report outlines the following two major </p><p>areas for the increased monitoring effort to focus on: </p><p> </p><p>-- (1) Long-range weaponry:  The report recommends that </p><p>the two sides agree to place their long-range weaponry </p><p>in "designated areas under international monitoring." </p><p>If the LTTE objects to this, the group would be asked to </p><p>allow the monitors to inspect the equipment where it is </p><p>in place. </p><p> </p><p>-- (2) Challenge Inspections:  At the request of one of </p><p>the sides, the monitors would inspect a site or sites </p><p>controlled by the other side in order to ensure that all </p><p>was in conformity with the ceasefire agreement. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) (((Note:  In recommending that monitors focus on </p><p>these two areas, the report clearly is taking into </p><p>account two great fears of the Sri Lankan military in </p><p>Jaffna:  First, that the LTTE, in a sudden strike, would </p><p>use its long-range guns positioned in the Wanni to </p><p>devastate Palaly airbase.  Second, that without </p><p>inspections, the military could miss a surge in LTTE </p><p>troop concentrations potentially signaling the launch of </p><p>a surprise attack.))) </p><p> </p><p>================== </p><p>Re Key Road Artery </p><p>================== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In addition to the items reviewed above, the </p><p>monitors would also be responsible for facilitating a </p><p>confidence-building measure involving the use of the </p><p>"A-9" road.  (Note:  This important road connecting </p><p>Jaffna with the south reopened a year ago.  Due to the </p><p>war, it had been closed for over a decade.)  Nambiar </p><p>advocates that the Sri Lankan military be allowed to use </p><p>the road, something that it is currently unable to do </p><p>because a key stretch is within LTTE-controlled </p><p>territory.  If the Tigers were amenable, the monitors </p><p>would ensure that the military\'s vehicles would not be </p><p>subject to stops and searches on this stretch of the </p><p>road.  (Note:  The opening of the A-9 to such convoys is </p><p>important to the military, which is now reliant </p><p>exclusively on air and sea transport for resupply and </p><p>troop deployments involving Jaffna.) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In our estimation, the report is professional </p><p>and fair-minded.  Nambiar clearly understands how </p><p>volatile this issue is and the need to proceed via </p><p>deliberate steps.  Our guess is that the Sri Lankan </p><p>military will like most of the report, as it takes into </p><p>account many of its security concerns.  (Note:  The </p><p>military may not be too thrilled with the idea of </p><p>"challenge inspections" of its positions, however.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Despite Nambiar\'s best efforts to be fair to the </p><p>LTTE, however, it is quite possible that the group will </p><p>balk at what he recommends.  The Tigers seem to want to </p><p>keep the security zone issue alive for political </p><p>reasons, as it has proven a useful tool in whipping up </p><p>support in Jaffna.  It is also tough to see the Tigers, </p><p>at this time, agreeing to the monitoring of their long- </p><p>range weapons or allowing "challenge inspections" of </p><p>sites in the Wanni.  Of course, the Tigers could </p><p>surprise everyone, but the group has shown no indication </p><p>that it wants to compromise on this particular issue. </p><p>(Note:  Earlier this year, for example, the LTTE pulled </p><p>out of a joint committee set up to review security- </p><p>related issues, after vociferously rejecting a </p><p>preliminary report prepared by the GSL military re the </p><p>security zone issue.)  The best that can probably be </p><p>expected is that the group does not reject the report </p><p>outright, but agrees to review it.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
