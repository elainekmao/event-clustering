<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001273 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY); IIP/G/WHA DIPASQUALE; EB/EPPD DCLUNE; </p><p>USTR AGASH </p><p>INFO IIP/T/ES </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, IOs, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA, ETRD, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON CAFTA, JUNE 4, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Editorial  on  liberal daily "La  Tribuna",  Tegucigalpa </p><p>based 6/4 entitled: "Obstacles for CAFTA". "The CAFTA, which </p><p>is  being negotiated by five Central American countries  and </p><p>the  United  States, is progressively facing more  and  more </p><p>obstacles and disagreements from various social sectors  all </p><p>over  Central  America.  They believe  their  interests  and </p><p>proposals are not being considered in the negotiations, even </p><p>though  the  governments  involved  in  this  process   have </p><p>facilitated  the  participation of  entrepreneurial  groups, </p><p>workers\'  unions  and  civil  society  organizations  in  an </p><p>"adjacent  room",  next  to  the rooms  where  the  official </p><p>negotiations are taking place." </p><p> </p><p>"During  the  latest  round of negotiations,  some  Honduran </p><p>entrepreneurial  groups were shocked by certain  concessions </p><p>made  by Guatemala, which were believed to be a strategy  to </p><p>make  up  for  the  poor record in the fight  against  narco </p><p>trafficking. As a result, Guatemala was accused of  "selling </p><p>the   guitar"   or  undermining  the  basic  principles   of </p><p>negotiation  that  the Central American  teams  have  agreed </p><p>upon." </p><p> </p><p>"The  fact  that the obstacles to CAFTA are not  exclusively </p><p>related  to  the "unyielding position" of the United  States </p><p>toward  this  process, but also to the severe  disagreements </p><p>between the Central American negotiation teams." </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
