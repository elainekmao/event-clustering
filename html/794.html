<p>S E C R E T PHNOM PENH 003751 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598:  DECL:  11/14/2025 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, CB </p><p>SUBJECT:  FURTHER EVIDENCE OF HUN SEN\'S MENTAL </p><p>STATE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  PHNOM PENH 3720 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) SUMMARY.  SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN </p><p>HAS CALLED FOR A FORMAL RCG INVESTIGATION INTO A </p><p>REPORT, PUBLISHED BY A LOCAL NEWSPAPER, OF A PLOT </p><p>TO ASSASSINATE HIM.  THE REPORT, SOURCED TO </p><p>FUNCINPEC SECRETARY-GENERAL SIRIVUDH, IS MOST </p><p>LIKELY LITTLE MORE THAN UNFOUNDED RUMOR, POSSIBLY </p><p>FLOATED BY THE SOMETIMES MISCHIEVOUS SIRIVUDH TO </p><p>PROVOKE A REACTION FROM HUN SEN, WHO CONTINUES TO </p><p>SHOW A NEAR-OBSESSION WITH HIS PERSONAL SECURITY </p><p>(REFTEL).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE NOVEMBER 11 ISSUE OF "NEW ANGKOR" </p><p>NEWSPAPER CONTAINED A STORY ABOUT A POSSIBLE PLOT </p><p>BY UNNAMED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO ASSASSINATE </p><p>SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN AS HE TRAVELED TO </p><p>THE NEARBY HUN SEN DEVELOPMENT ZONE OR VISITED THE </p><p>ROYAL PALACE (WHERE HIS BODYGUARDS USUALLY REMAIN </p><p>OUTSIDE).  FUNCINPEC PARTY SECRETARY GENERAL AND </p><p>FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER PRINCE NORODOM SIRIVUDH, </p><p>WHO, THE ARTICLE SAID, REVEALED THE PLOT TO THE </p><p>PAPER, SUBSEQUENTLY DENIED THAT HE KNEW ANYTHING </p><p>ABOUT IT.  THREE DAYS LATER, HUN SEN DESCRIBED THE </p><p>ALLEGED PLAN IN A SPEECH AT A MILITARY TRAINING </p><p>CENTER NEAR PHNOM PENH, NOTING THAT THE ATTEMPT </p><p>WOULD OCCUR IN APRIL, 1996.  HE DID NOT SPECULATE </p><p>WHO WAS BEHIND THE PLOT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) CO-INTERIOR MINISTER YOU HOCKRY TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR DURING A NOVEMBER 14 FAREWELL LUNCH </p><p>THAT HUN SEN WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE REPORT AND </p><p>HAD, WITH FIRST PRIME MINISTER RANARIDDH\'S </p><p>CONSENT, REQUESTED A FORMAL RCG INVESTIGATION.  HE </p><p>SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED THAT HOCKRY, RATHER THAN </p><p>HIS CPP COLLEAGUE AND SOMETIMES PERCEIVED RIVAL, </p><p>CO-INTERIOR MINISTER SAR KHENG, HEAD THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) HOCKRY ALSO OBSERVED THAT EVEN BEFORE THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION RUMOR HUN SEN HAD BEEN ACTING MORE </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT HIS SECURITY.  WHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>HE TRAVELS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, HE TAKES ABOUT 60 </p><p>BODYGUARDS WITH HIM--MORE THAN ANY OTHER OFFICIAL. </p><p>(BY WAY OF COMPARISON, HOCKRY SAID HE TAKES SIX </p><p>PERSONS AND SAR KHENG UP TO FORTY.)  AFTER "NEW </p><p>ANGKOR" PUBLISHED THE ASSASSINATION STORY, HUN SEN </p><p>CUT SHORT HIS VISIT TO SIEM REAP AND FLEW BACK TO </p><p>PHNOM PENH; IN A DEPARTURE FROM HIS NORMAL </p><p>ROUTINE, HE ASKED THAT HIS HELICOPTER PICK HIM UP </p><p>DIRECTLY FROM HIS HOTEL, ACCORDING TO HOCKRY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) IN A POSSIBLY RELATED MATTER, FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER UNG HUOT ASKED THE AMBASSADOR AT A </p><p>FAREWELL DINNER ON NOVEMBER 13 WHETHER THE USG HAD </p><p>ANY INFORMATION ABOUT A POSSIBLE ATTEMPT TO </p><p>OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO. </p><p>HE CLAIMED THAT THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>"AWARE" OF THE INFORMATION.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>INFORMED HUOT THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) COMMENT:  SIRIVUDH ONCE TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT HE DELIBERATELY MADE PROVOCATIVE </p><p>STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS IN ORDER TO ELICIT </p><p>REACTIONS FROM PEOPLE AND THEN ASSESS WHERE THEY </p><p>TRULY STAND ON ISSUES.  HE DENIED INFORMING THE </p><p>LOCAL PAPER OF THE ALLEGED ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, </p><p>BUT WE WOULD NOT PUT IT PAST HIM SINCE HE HAS DONE </p><p>SIMILAR THINGS IN THE PAST.  IN ANY EVENT, HUN SEN </p><p>HAS BEEN PROVOKED INTO REACTING, AND HIS REACTION </p><p>IS IN KEEPING WITH HIS INCREASED CONCERN, SOME </p><p>HERE CALL IT PARANOIA, ABOUT HIS PERSONAL SECURITY </p><p>(REFTEL).  IN OUR VIEW, RUMORS SUCH AS THIS ARE </p><p>NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY HERE, AND THE STORY </p><p>PROBABLY HAS LITTLE OR NO BASIS IN FACT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TWINING </p><p></p></div>
