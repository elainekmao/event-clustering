Authorities responded quickly to the violence; </p><p>nonetheless, the fighting escalated. Houses and vehicles were </p><p>set ablaze and shots were fired.  While fleeing the scene, </p><p>the AMCIT counted at least 6 dead.  He also observed hundreds </p><p>of youths (presumably Muslim by their attire) moving toward </p><p>the riot from the Eastern part of the city.  However, by the </p><p>time of his call, it appeared that calm had been restored. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The following warden message was distributed by Post: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A  serious disturbance occurred  in the Uni-Jos area of Jos </p><p>early this afternoon.  (2 May).  We have reports of burning </p><p>houses and cars as well as some casualties.  A large military </p><p>or police presence is said to be on the scene.  We urge all </p><p>American Citizens traveling to Jos to reconsider this travel </p><p>as the violence may erupt again in the near term.  We urge </p><p>all American Citizens living in Jos to avoid real and </p><p>potential areas of conflict and to stay indoors until the </p><p>conflict subsides.   Even after the violence ends, Jos may be </p><p>unsettled and we urge all American citizens to exercise </p><p>particular caution until the situation in Jos is stabilized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
