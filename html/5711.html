<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 000553 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DOD FOR DEPSECDEF, SECDEF FOR DUSD POLICY, DUSD TECHNOLOGY, </p><p>DUSD SECURITY, DUSD POLICY AND COUNTER-PROLIFERATION </p><p>COMFLCC ALSO PASS TO SURGEON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, KU, MCAP, PREL, PTER, US </p><p>SUBJECT: ANTHRAX AND SMALLPOX PROGRAM FOR KUWAITI MILITARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA FRANK C. URBANCIC, REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The United States and Kuwait are standing shoulder to </p><p>shoulder in the international effort to disarm Iraq.  As a </p><p>result of Kuwait\'s geographic location next to Iraq, and the </p><p>political decision by the GoK to support very large numbers </p><p>of US troops in the country, Kuwait is the first and most </p><p>likely target of any future Iraqi bio-terror attack in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) All US troops are fully vaccinated against both </p><p>anthrax and smallpox.  As part of its own efforts to provide </p><p>equal protections to its troops who will be standing in the </p><p>same terrain as their US counterparts, the GoK has requested </p><p>enough smallpox and anthrax vaccine to inoculate 15,000 of </p><p>its own personnel.  The US response has been disappointing, </p><p>and our hosts have negatively noted it.  In the LoA which we </p><p>have been instructed to provide to the Kuwaitis, the US has </p><p>offered only enough anthrax vaccine for 2750 people, and it </p><p>has offered to sell both the anthrax and smallpox vaccines, </p><p>vice provide it as aid in kind.  Thus, we are not only not </p><p>providing quantities sufficient to protect these coalition </p><p>partners, we are asking them to pay for these relatively </p><p>small and insufficient amounts. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) This slap at the Kuwaitis has arrived at exactly the </p><p>same moment that the Embassy is engaged in intensive efforts </p><p>with the GoK to secure their approval (not required under the </p><p>terms of the current DCA) to provide additional millions of </p><p>dollars-worth of jet fuel, access to ports, and vast amounts </p><p>of other supplies to US forces as aid in kind from the GoK to </p><p>the coalition forces.  Embassy views this situation as </p><p>degrading to our overall relationship, potentially </p><p>jeopardizing Kuwaiti willingness to approve future aid in </p><p>kind requests from the United States. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Action Request:  That the Department revisit this </p><p>issue with DoD urgently to secure sufficient supplies of </p><p>smallpox and anthrax vaccine for the full 15,000 personnel </p><p>requests by the GoK, and that it be provided as aid in kind </p><p>from the United States. </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
