(C) THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS THE FURTHER ANALYSIS </p><p>AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS OF SPECIAL ENVOY WOLPE AND </p><p>SPECIAL ADVISOR PRENDERGAST REGARDING THE LUSAKA PEACE </p><p>PROCESS FOR THE CONGO.  IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN </p><p>TANDEM WITH LUSAKA 3426. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AS THE CLOCK CONTINUES TO TICK TOWARDS THE UN </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION ON THE REAUTHORIZATION OF MONUC, </p><p>IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT </p><p>THE LUSAKA PROCESS CAN BE RESCUED IS IF THE EXTERNAL </p><p>SIGNATORIES - ANGOLA, ZIMBABWE, NAMIBIA, RWANDA AND </p><p>UGANDA - DECIDE TO RAMP UP THEIR COLLECTIVE PRESSURE ON </p><p>THEIR RESPECTIVE CONGOLESE ALLIES.  ALL OF THEM </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY SHARE A COMMON INTEREST IN </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT, THE BEST MEANS OF </p><p>SECURING STABILITY IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THE COMMON INTEREST THAT </p><p>ANGOLA, RWANDA AND UGANDA HAVE IN COUNTERING THE THREATS </p><p>POSED TO THEM BY THEIR RESPECTIVE INSURGENCIES OPERATING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04309  01 OF 02  031034Z </p><p>FROM CONGOLESE SOIL.  OUR MESSAGE HAS RESONATED WITH THE </p><p>PARTIES MOST CLEARLY WHEN WE SPELL OUT THE REPERCUSSIONS </p><p>OF RENEWED WAR RESULTING FROM THE OBSTRUCTION OF THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF LUSAKA.  IF THE WAR RESUMES, THE </p><p>PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES WILL BE THESE INSURGENCIES, </p><p>PRINCIPALLY UNITA, EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWA, AND THE ADF.  THE </p><p>CORE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF ZIMBABWE--AND </p><p>TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT NAMIBIA--ARE HARMED AS WELL. </p><p>BECAUSE OF THIS DANGER OF ESCALATION, THE EXTERNAL </p><p>SIGNATORIES ALL AGREED WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>URGENCY OF THE NEED FOR THEM TO INCREASE THEIR </p><p>COOPERATION WITH EACH OTHER AND TO INTENSIFY THEIR </p><p>PRESSURE ON THEIR CONGOLESE ALLIES IMMEDIATELY.  IF NOT, </p><p>LUSAKA IS DEAD. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) OUR MEETINGS WITH ANGOLAN AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE FURTHER SENSITIZED US TO THE CHALLENGES </p><p>OF MOVING FROM INTENTIONS TO IMPLEMENTATION IN SUCH AN </p><p>EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES STRATEGY.  IN ORDER TO RESTORE A </p><p>SITUATION IN WHICH THE SELF-DEFINED INTERESTS OF EACH OF </p><p>THE EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES COME TOGETHER IN A COOPERATIVE </p><p>AND SUSTAINED REGIONAL STRATEGY, A GREAT DEAL OF TRUST </p><p>WILL HAVE TO BE REBUILT, AND SERIOUS DIALOGUE MUST BE </p><p>INITIATED BETWEEN SOME OF THE KEY SIGNATORIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ANGOLA AND RWANDA HAVE NOT OVERCOME THE SENSE OF </p><p>BETRAYAL BOTH FEEL OVER THE EVENTS OF AUGUST 1998. </p><p>ANGOLA BELIEVES UGANDA AND THE MLC ARE COOPERATING WITH </p><p>UNITA.  ZIMBABWE AND UGANDA ARE HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS OF </p><p>EACH OTHER\'S MOVEMENTS AND INTENTIONS IN EQUATEUR.  AND </p><p>RWANDA AND UGANDA ALMOST EXPECT TO BE UNDERMINED BY EACH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04309  01 OF 02  031034Z </p><p>OTHER IN PURSUIT OF THEIR INTERESTS IN THE CONGO. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THEREFORE, IT IS CLEAR THAT FOR AN EXTERNAL </p><p>SIGNATORIES STRATEGY TO WORK, IT IS NECESSARY FOR THESE </p><p>PARTIES TO ADDRESS URGENTLY SOME OF THEIR DEEPER </p><p>BILATERAL PROBLEMS. ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES ON A </p><p>BILATERAL BASIS WILL PAVE THE WAY TO BROADER AGREEMENTS </p><p>AMONG ALL OF THE EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) OUR MEETINGS DURING THE LAST THREE WEEKS HAVE </p><p>DEMONSTRATED THAT THE USG CAN PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN </p><p>BROKERING THESE BILATERAL CONTACTS AND BUILDING THE </p><p>CONSENSUS AROUND AN EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES STRATEGY.  ALL </p><p>FIVE COUNTRIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE USG CAN AND </p><p>SHOULD PLAY THAT ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MOST URGENT IS THE REQUEST FROM RWANDA TO HELP </p><p>BROKER A DIALOGUE WITH ANGOLA.  OUR ANGOLAN </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS ARE CLEARLY INTERESTED, AND WILL AWAIT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4639 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04309  02 OF 02  031034Z </p><p>ACTION SSO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    DODE-00  ANHR-00  TEDE-00  IO-00    OIC-02 </p><p>      P-00     SS-00    SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------75B98A  031034Z /38 </p><p>R 031031Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6759 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p>CIA WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 004309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR P U/S PICKERING, AF A/S SUSAN RICE, AF PDAS </p><p>NANCY POWELL </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE AND ORR </p><p> </p><p>OSD FOR MCCONNELL </p><p> </p><p>CIA FOR HOUDEK </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04309  02 OF 02  031034Z </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/03/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES STRATEGY FOR THE CONGO </p><p>PEACE PROCESS: NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p>FINAL APPROVAL FROM PRESIDENT DOS SANTOS.  ANGOLA ALSO </p><p>MAY BE INTERESTED IN A SIMILAR EXERCISE WITH UGANDA. </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND UGANDA MAY ALSO REQUIRE SUCH AN INITIATIVE, </p><p>OR AT THE VERY LEAST FOR US TO CONTINUE TO CARRY </p><p>MESSAGES BACK AND FORTH AS WE HAVE DONE DURING THE PAST </p><p>FEW WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) NOW IS THE TIME TO MOVE.  THE KEY SIGNATORIES </p><p>APPEAR SERIOUS ABOUT REACHING SOME DEEPER </p><p>UNDERSTANDINGS.  THE EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES STRATEGY WILL </p><p>NOT BE SUSTAINABLE UNLESS SOME OF THESE SERIOUS </p><p>BILATERAL ISSUES OF TRUST ARE NOT ADDRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE USG\'S ROLE CAN AND SHOULD BE A MULTIFACETED </p><p>ONE.  WE CAN ACT AS FACILITATORS FOR THE ACTUAL POL-MIL </p><p>BILATERAL DIALOGUES, OR AT LEAST PASS IMPORTANT MESSAGES </p><p>BACK AND FORTH.  WE CAN HELP FIND COMMON APPROACHES TO </p><p>SPECIFIC SECURITY THREATS ON A BILATERAL BASIS.  WE CAN </p><p>OFFER IDEAS ON HOW TO APPROACH OR PRESSURE THE CONGOLESE </p><p>PARTIES WHEN THEY OBSTRUCT THE PROCESS.  WE CAN SUPPORT </p><p>THEIR DIALOGUE AND THEIR PLANNING FOR DDRR, AN ISSUE </p><p>THAT ALL OF THEM FEEL DEEPLY ABOUT BUT TOWARDS WHICH </p><p>THEY HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES.  WE CAN OFFER IDEAS ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04309  02 OF 02  031034Z </p><p>(AND CONSIDER SUPPORTING) INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY BILATERAL OR </p><p>MULTILATERAL AGREEMENTS OR UNDERSTANDINGS THAT EMERGE </p><p>FROM THESE MEETINGS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE CAN CONSIDER HOW </p><p>THE UNITA SANCTIONS COMMITTEE -- WITH OUR SUPPORT -- </p><p>COULD HELP MONITOR OR INVESTIGATE ANY ALLEGATION OF </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN UNITA AND THE MLC, RCD, GOR, OR GOU. </p><p>WE COULD RESURRECT THE IDEA OF SUPPORTING THE DEPLOYMENT </p><p>OF MONITORS IN KEY AIRSTRIPS IN THE DRC TO ENSURE </p><p>AGAINST EASY RESUPPLY BY UNITA OR THE EX- </p><p>FAR/INTERAHAMWE.  WE COULD HELP ELABORATE A COMMON </p><p>STRATEGY FOR SEPARATING THE GENOCIDAIRES LEADERSHIP FROM </p><p>THE RANK AND FILE MILITIA, A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WHICH </p><p>PROBABLY HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH THE EVENTS OF 1994.  WE </p><p>CAN EXPLORE HOW THE UNSC SANCTIONS COMMITTEE CHARGED </p><p>WITH ADDRESSING RESUPPLY OF THE EX-FAR/INTERAHAMWE MIGHT </p><p>WORK TOGETHER IN SOME WAY WITH THE UNITA SANCTIONS </p><p>COMMITTEE TO FURTHER COMMON SECURITY OBJECTIVES IN THE </p><p>REGION.  THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE WAYS THAT THE USG </p><p>CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SUPPORTING THE NECESSARY BUILDING </p><p>BLOCKS FOR A SUCCESSFUL EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) A FINAL CAUTION: SUCH A STRATEGY WILL REQUIRE </p><p>SOME PATIENCE.  OUR MEETINGS AND THE RECENT POLITICAL </p><p>COMMITTEE SESSION INDICATE A DEMONSTRABLE SHIFT TOWARDS </p><p>TARGETING ANY SIGNATORY THAT THREATENS THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF LUSAKA.  BUT THESE REGIONAL LEADERS </p><p>HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF WORKING VERY SLOWLY IN ACTUALLY </p><p>IMPLEMENTING PROFOUND SHIFTS IN STRATEGY.  ALL OF THEM </p><p>NOW CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT KABILA IS THE PRIMARY </p><p>OBSTACLE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LUSAKA (WITH J.P. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04309  02 OF 02  031034Z </p><p>BEMBA A DISTANT BUT SYMBOLICALLY IMPORTANT SECONDARY </p><p>OBSTACLE).  BUT IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME FOR SPECIFIC </p><p>ACTIONS TO MATERIALIZE IN SUPPORT OF DISLODGING THE </p><p>STATUS QUO.  USG ASSISTANCE IN BROKERING BILATERAL </p><p>UNDERSTANDINGS WILL IN TURN UNDERGIRD BROADER CONSENSUS </p><p>- BUILDING AMONG THE EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES, IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF A PROCESS AND PACE THAT NECESSARILY MUST BE </p><p>OWNED BY THEM. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
