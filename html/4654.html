<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 001570 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, BM, Human Rights, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: ONLY 75 OF 115 POLITICAL PRISONERS RELEASED </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 1510 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  On November 19, the State Peace and Development </p><p>Council (SPDC) announced the release of 115 political </p><p>prisoners, and the UN Secretary General immediately welcomed </p><p>the announcement.  As of December 10, however, it appears </p><p>that only 75 of these 115 political prisoners have been </p><p>released.  NLD Secretary U Lwin told Poloff that he could </p><p>account for only 50 NLD members and one student from another </p><p>political party that had been released, and "maybe about 20 </p><p>other releases."  The NLD Political Prisoners Support </p><p>Committee (PPSC), which offers legal and financial support to </p><p>families of all political prisoners, can account for only 75 </p><p>releases from the 115.  The PPSC said it has verified this </p><p>information with the International Committee for the Red </p><p>Cross. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Several of the political prisoners released after </p><p>the November 19 announcement told Poloff that they were </p><p>required to sign an agreement accepting the conditions of </p><p>Section 401 of the penal code.  Under this section, the </p><p>prisoners are subject to serving the remainder of their </p><p>current sentences if they are rearrested for any reason.  The </p><p>prisoners reported that some of their fellow prisoners </p><p>refused to sign the 401 agreement and that this may have been </p><p>the reason they were not released.  U Lwin opined that </p><p>political prisoners who are close to the end of their </p><p>sentences are more willing to sign the agreement than those </p><p>who have several years to go.  Those with long sentences do </p><p>not want the fear of an automatic long sentence hanging over </p><p>them, he said.  Others choose not to sign on principle. </p><p>There were some political prisoners released just after talks </p><p>with Aung San Suu Kyi began who were not required to sign the </p><p>Section 401 agreement, but apparently all are now required to </p><p>sign. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
