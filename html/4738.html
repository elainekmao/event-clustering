<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 003323 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, PGOV, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LONDON CLUB DEBT BUY-BACK POSTPONED TO </p><p>ALLOW ABACHA FAMILY TO PARTICIPATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The Government of Nigeria\'s (GON) attempt to </p><p>buy back $2 billion of its London Club (commercial) debt </p><p>obligations suffered a setback Friday, December 6, when a </p><p>court injunction sought by the family of the late military </p><p>dictator Sani Abacha forced a postponement of the auction to </p><p>December 20.  The Abacha family holds 23 percent of the Brady </p><p>Bonds and other debt slated for the debt redemption scheme. </p><p>However, these Abacha assets were previously frozen by court </p><p>action at the request of the Nigerian government.  The </p><p>Nigerian government and other claimants to the Abacha funds </p><p>agreed to allow the family to participate in the buy back. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Director-General of the Debt Management Office Akin </p><p>Arikawe told us that the Abacha family had bought their bonds </p><p>with money taken directly from Central Bank accounts during </p><p>the regime of the late dictator Sani Abacha.  Arikawe </p><p>confirmed that the par bonds were part of the Abacha assets </p><p>frozen at the request of the Nigerian government.  However, </p><p>both the DMO and lead adviser to the buy-back scheme, </p><p>Citigroup, appear to have overlooked the Abacha bonds when </p><p>they planned the debt buy back.  Consequently the Abacha </p><p>family obtained a court order enjoining the December 6 </p><p>auction and allowing them to participate.  The court granted </p><p>their request with the acquiescence of the GON and the Noga </p><p>family, which is headed by a Lebanese businessman who was </p><p>formerly a business partner of Sani Abacha and part owner of </p><p>the Abuja Hilton.  The court stipulated that the cash derived </p><p>from sale of the instruments would be frozen in a special </p><p>account.  The extension of the deadline to December 20 will </p><p>also mollify other bondholders who complained about the </p><p>non-disclosure of the Abacha bonds in the initial offer </p><p>document. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) According to Arikawe, the GON and Noga family decided </p><p>it was ultimately better to include the Abacha $470 million </p><p>in par bonds (of the $2 billion total) in the auction. </p><p>Without such participation, the GON would not reach its goal </p><p>of reducing London Club debt stock/servicing by 75 to 85 </p><p>percent.   Arikawe was also concerned that bond holders who </p><p>chose not to participate in the auction would find their </p><p>bonds linked to the Abacha bonds which by then would make up </p><p>the preponderance of nonconverted bonds.   The value and </p><p>status of these bonds could be linked, however </p><p>unintentionally, to the outcome of the GON v. Abacha court </p><p>case, opening the GON to the possibility of new court cases </p><p>from bond holders other than the Abachas.  Citigroup had </p><p>participated in freezing Abacha assets and -- according to </p><p>the DMO Director General -- should have known about the </p><p>Abacha par bonds.  Like Arikawe, Citigroup apparently somehow </p><p>overlooked the problem when they put the prospectus together. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Arikawe confirmed that President Obasanjo consented </p><p>to inclusion of the Abacha bonds in the sale, even though </p><p>this might lead to the perception the President was giving in </p><p>to the deceased dictator\'s family once again.  Arikawe thinks </p><p>it is simpler to accede to the request, rather than become </p><p>enmeshed in another series of drawn out court cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: Newspaper headlines about the Abacha family </p><p>stopping the auction were undoubtedly embarrassing for the </p><p>Presidency, especially after the late dictator\'s son Mohammed </p><p>Abacha reneged on a reported agreement to return US $1.3 </p><p>billion in exchange for his release from prison and dropping </p><p>murder charges against him.  Arikawe believes there will be </p><p>little permanent political fallout from the delayed buy-back </p><p>and he is likely right.  Instead of criticizing the President </p><p>on this point, most Nigerians will focus on the bitter irony </p><p>of the Abachas\' using the judicial process to protect their </p><p>position as a creditor and their ownership of assets </p><p>purchased with funds stolen directly from the Nigerian </p><p>treasury.  Nevertheless, continuous problems with the </p><p>buy-back will hurt Nigeria\'s objective of reducing its </p><p>debt-servicing burden.  Thus, a hitch-free December 20 </p><p>auction might be the kind of Christmas present Arikawe and </p><p>the DMO are hoping for. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
