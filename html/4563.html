GENEVA 4707 </p><p>     B. GENEVA 4652 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 2207 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In November 26 meeting with donor </p><p>representatives, Director of UNHCR\'s Bureau for Asia and the </p><p>Pacific Jean-Marie Fakhouri attributed at least part of the </p><p>blame for the recent sexual exploitation scandal (refs) to a </p><p>complacent attitude among local UNHCR representatives, and </p><p>promised to address what he views as a lack of proper contact </p><p>between the refugee camps and UNHCR.  Fakhouri also stated </p><p>that bilateral efforts to resolve the problem of resettling </p><p>the refugees have been exhausted, and that UNHCR is exploring </p><p>the possibility of a multilateral solution by 2003. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>REFUGEE SEX SCANDAL: </p><p>THE ROAD WAS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a November 26 meeting with donor reps, UNHCR </p><p>Director for Asia and the Pacific Jean-Marie Fakhouri </p><p>acknowledged that at least part of the responsibility for the </p><p>eighteen cases of sexual exploitation recently exposed in the </p><p>Bhutanese refugee camps of eastern Nepal (refs) rests on the </p><p>shoulders of UNHCR officials, but that the situation which </p><p>allowed the cases to go unnoticed was created with the best </p><p>of intentions.  In the "model camps" set up in Nepal, UNHCR </p><p>representatives empowered refugees to manage their own </p><p>affairs, and monitored the camps through a filter of NGOs, </p><p>which hired refugees to fill many of their staff positions </p><p>for education, health and other programs within the confines </p><p>of the camps.  The system was held up as an example to be </p><p>emulated by other UNHCR projects around the world. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Unfortunately, according to Fakhouri, the system was </p><p>so successful that UNHCR representatives distanced themselves </p><p>too far from direct administration.  When allegations of </p><p>sexual misconduct began to surface, they failed to take </p><p>action, he said, characterizing the local representatives as </p><p>having "put their feet up on their desks, leaned back in </p><p>their chairs and said: the NGOs are managing it, all will be </p><p>well."  Camp committees were unable or unwilling to take </p><p>action, however, possibly due to reluctance to admit the </p><p>problem.  Even now, said Fakhouri, one camp committee </p><p>insisted to him no abuse had taken place in their own camp. </p><p>At the same time, psychologists sent by UNHCR were </p><p>interviewing victims just outside the meeting hall. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Fakhouri used his explanation not as an excuse for </p><p>inaction nor as a condemnation of the "model camps."  On the </p><p>contrary, he claimed that at least one camp committee had </p><p>made UNHCR-Nepal aware of complaints as early as July 2001, </p><p>and that the lack of follow-up by local representatives was </p><p>under close scrutiny in Geneva.  "From everything I\'ve </p><p>heard," he admitted, "the goal (of empowering the refugees) </p><p>was reached.  We have no intention of stripping the camp </p><p>committees of their authority.  But we intend to make sure </p><p>that there is better structure, guidance and monitoring. We </p><p>must regain the contact that we seem to have lost."  He </p><p>indicated that UNHCR plans to send a contingent of volunteers </p><p>to increase its presence in the camps, and is already </p><p>implementing an awareness campaign so that residents of the </p><p>camps are aware of their rights and the system by which they </p><p>can report complaints directly to UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p>NEPAL MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Fakhouri came to Nepal for meetings with Government </p><p>officials to emphasize their responsibility for the security </p><p>of refugees on their soil.  Though pleased with the </p><p>cooperation he has received thus far from police and Chief </p><p>District Office officials in terms of investigating and </p><p>prosecuting the known cases of sexual abuse, Fakhouri was </p><p>unimpressed with the anemic police presence in the </p><p>camps--five officers and one sub-inspector are assigned to </p><p>each camp of fifteen to twenty thousand refugees and leave </p><p>the camps at night.  Claiming that most GON civil service </p><p>posts with responsibility for the camps are vacant, Fakhouri </p><p>accused Nepalese authorities of having "disengaged" from the </p><p>issue and of having made no real attempt to manage the </p><p>refugees. </p><p> </p><p>BILATERAL POSSIBILITIES "EXHAUSTED" </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  In the same vein, Fakhouri said that "bilateralism </p><p>has exhausted all of its possibilities," and related that </p><p>ambassadors from countries friendly to Bhutan were already </p><p>engaged in discussions in Geneva in search of an expeditious </p><p>multilateral solution. "This has dragged on too long," he </p><p>said. "Something has to be done soon, and by that I mean that </p><p>we need to develop and present something by 2003."  Stating </p><p>that it is unrealistic to expect that all 100,000 refugees </p><p>will go back to Bhutan or that all 100,000 will be accepted </p><p>for resettlement in Nepal, he suggested the need for a </p><p>burden-sharing package between the two countries, perhaps </p><p>brokered by neighbors or friendly countries with an interest </p><p>in helping the refugees return to Bhutan or be integrated </p><p>into Nepal.  He hinted that a "token resettlement to a third </p><p>country" would be an attractive option at some point in the </p><p>process to demonstrate good will by outside parties, but that </p><p>the preferable solution would be first to try to reach an </p><p>agreement between the two major protagonists. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment: It is clear from Fakhouri\'s briefing that </p><p>UNHCR is doing its utmost to be transparent and honest about </p><p>the recent allegations of abuse, to admit that mistakes were </p><p>made, and draw useful lessons from the unfortunate events. </p><p>Also encouraging is apparent UNHCR interest in pursuing </p><p>multilateral initiatives for solving the continuing deadlock </p><p>between the GON and the Government of Bhutan. Embassy agrees </p><p>that the Bhutanese-Nepalese refugee problem has </p><p>persisted--and grown--long enough and should be soluble </p><p>through creative international effort.  Post will share our </p><p>thinking about a possible formula for resolution septel. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
