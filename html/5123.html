(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  Visiting Policy Planning Director </p><p>Ambassador Richard Haass, accompanied by Ambassador Wahba, </p><p>S/P staffer Dr. Meghan O\'Sullivan, A/DCM and control </p><p>officer, called January 8 on UAE Central Bank Governor </p><p>Sultan bin Nasser Al-Suweidi.  Al-Suweidi was attended by </p><p>the Bank\'s FIU chief, the head of Banking Supervision, and </p><p>the Correspondent Banking director.  Topics covered included </p><p>need for better SOPs for information-sharing on terrorist </p><p>financing, developing a consensus on the role of Financial </p><p>Intelligence Units, developing world concerns about the WTO, </p><p>and efforts to move towards a common market in the GCC.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>CBG CALLS FOR GREATER INFO EXCHANGE ON TERRORIST FINANCING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador Haass noted the considerable steps the UAE </p><p>has taken to address anti-money laundering and terrorist </p><p>financing issues and asked the Governor for his views of how </p><p>good a job the international community is doing in </p><p>addressing the latter concern.  Al-Suweidi said a lot has </p><p>been accomplished and that international consensus had been </p><p>key to much of the progress to date.  That said, he stressed </p><p>the need for even greater openness and sharing of </p><p>information on terrorist financing, particularly the </p><p>requirement to remove many of the legal constraints in the </p><p>developing world which make it difficult to obtain financial </p><p>data.  He suggested that an international standard should be </p><p>set for the role of Financial Intelligence Units -- to </p><p>empower them, for example, to provide telephone numbers and </p><p>other data which often lie outside the authority of existing </p><p>FIUs.  Privacy issues may be a consideration, of course, but </p><p>an agreed scope of authority for FIUs world-wide -- </p><p>especially if that authority was defined broadly, could be </p><p>of inestimable value in the war on terrorist financing. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador Haass asked if some new international </p><p>convention or agreement would be helpful; the Central Bank </p><p>Governor opined that existing mechanisms are adequate, but </p><p>what is needed is an agreed framework to better organize </p><p>international cooperation and to establish accepted standard </p><p>operating procedures to which all would subscribe.  He </p><p>noted, for example, that the FIU can provide telephone </p><p>numbers in response to inquiries -- something the U.S. FIU, </p><p>FinCEN, cannot.  The UAE provides information generously, </p><p>but often finds that the U.S. and others (particularly the </p><p>Germans) are much less user-friendly.  Ambassador Haass </p><p>agreed to take the Governor\'s suggestions back and to raise </p><p>them with Treasury. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>DEVELOPING WORLD DISAPPOINTED WITH WTO </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Ambassador Haass inquired into the UAE\'s experience </p><p>with the WTO and movements in the region towards creation of </p><p>a broader, more open market.  Al-Suweidi noted that the UAE </p><p>had been grandfathered into the WTO; Saudi had not and thus </p><p>faced far more restrictive terms for entry which made </p><p>accession much more difficult.  The WTO, he opined, had </p><p>proved to be a disappointment for the developing world, </p><p>where new regulations and policies proved both difficult to </p><p>explain to the populace and much more difficult to enforce </p><p>than in the OECD.  The advanced western economies tended to </p><p>have little understanding or concern with regard to what </p><p>would and would not work in the developing world. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In terms of creating a regional market, the Governor </p><p>noted that the GCC Customs Union was a move in the right </p><p>direction.  The principal problem in building closer </p><p>economic ties in the region is that most states have few </p><p>exports, and what few exports they have compete (rather than </p><p>compliment) their neighbors.  The UAE is far ahead of the </p><p>rest of the GCC in terms of economic diversification, and </p><p>ultimately hopes to be able to meet 60-80 percent of </p><p>domestic needs for goods via local manufacture.  Asked about </p><p>the future of the UAE as a regional high-tech center, the </p><p>Governor said the economic benefits are questionable.  Most </p><p>of the business is going to India and increasingly China, to </p><p>the degree that the workforce is expatriate, the net </p><p>economic benefits to the UAE of pursuing the high-tech route </p><p>probably don\'t exceed the costs by much. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) This cable has been cleared by Ambassador Haass. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
