Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Sri Lankans have reacted in a highly </p><p>positive fashion to the successful conclusion of the </p><p>first round of talks between the government and the </p><p>Tamil Tigers.  Contacts highlighted as noteworthy the </p><p>announcements that the two sides would soon meet again, </p><p>that they would form joint committees on certain issues, </p><p>and that Muslim leader Hakeem would meet Tiger leader </p><p>Prabhakaran next month.  LTTE spokesman Balasingham\'s </p><p>remarks backing away from separatism also reaped praise. </p><p>With the peace process steadily gaining traction, Sri </p><p>Lanka is rapidly becoming a changed country.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>========================== </p><p>Positive Reaction to Talks </p><p>========================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The successful outcome of the first round of </p><p>talks between the Sri Lankan government and the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has garnered a </p><p>highly positive reaction in Sri Lanka.  Sri Lankan TV, </p><p>radio, and newspapers have been full of reports on the </p><p>talks, with much comment directed toward the apparently </p><p>positive atmospherics shared by the two sides at the </p><p>closing press conference on September 18.  In a common </p><p>reaction from an observer, A.H.M. Fowzie, a senior </p><p>People\'s Alliance (PA) MP, told polchief:  "Given all </p><p>that has happened in the past, it was quite remarkable </p><p>to see how well Peiris (the chief GSL negotiator) and </p><p>Balasingham (the chief LTTE negotiator) got on." </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>Three Major Announcements </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Contacts welcomed what they saw as three major </p><p>announcements emerging from the talks: </p><p> </p><p>-- More Meetings:  The single important announcement was </p><p>seen as the two sides\' agreement to meet three more </p><p>times in coming months (See Ref A for exact dates). </p><p>K. Loganathan of the Center for Policy Analysis, a local </p><p>think-tank, told us that the fact that the two sides had </p><p>agreed to multiple meetings meant "they were gradually </p><p>getting subsumed in a process that would be difficult to </p><p>get out of without repercussions." </p><p> </p><p>-- Joint Bodies:  Another important agreement was that </p><p>the two sides would form joint bodies to look into such </p><p>issues as humanitarian assistance, as well as the </p><p>Sri Lankan military\'s "High Security Zones" in the north </p><p>and east.  Joseph Pararajahsingham, a pro-LTTE senior </p><p>Tamil National Alliance MP, told us that Tamils were </p><p>enthusiastic about the agreement to form these joint </p><p>bodies.  It indicated that the government was taking </p><p>seriously the "humanitarian plight" faced by the people </p><p>in Sri Lanka\'s north and east, he commented. </p><p> </p><p>-- Muslim/LTTE Meeting:  The two sides also agreed that </p><p>Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader (and GSL Minister) Rauf </p><p>Hakeem would meet with LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran next </p><p>month.  Such a meeting would be significant, as it would </p><p>afford Hakeem another opportunity to review strained </p><p>LTTE-Muslim relations with the LTTE\'s top leader, </p><p>according to M.L.A.M. Hizbullah, a senior PA MP.  (Note: </p><p>Hakeem was a member of the government\'s negotiating team </p><p>in Thailand.  Hakeem and Prabhakaran also met in April.) </p><p>(Note:  There were also unconfirmed press reports that </p><p>Minister Milinda Moragoda, a key member of the GSL\'s </p><p>peace process team, would also meet Prabhakaran next </p><p>month.) </p><p> </p><p>====================================== </p><p>LTTE Spokesman seems to nix separatism </p><p>====================================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) LTTE spokesman Balasingham\'s remarks backing </p><p>away from separatism also reaped praise.  In statements </p><p>that earned banner headlines in the local press, </p><p>Balasingham -- responding to repeated questions at the </p><p>September 18 press conference -- stated: </p><p> </p><p>-- "I wish to impress upon you that the LTTE does not </p><p>operate with the concept of a separate state.  Our </p><p>demand for a homeland is not for a separate state." </p><p> </p><p>-- "When we use the category or concept of self- </p><p>determination we mean that the concept entails </p><p>substantial autonomy or self-government in a homeland or </p><p>the historical areas where we live.  These aspirations </p><p>can be achieved in one country if we set about (the </p><p>discussions) correctly." </p><p> </p><p>-- "If our demand for regional autonomy and self- </p><p>government is rejected and conditions of oppression </p><p>continue as a last resort our people have no option </p><p>other than to fight for political independence or </p><p>statehood." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The general view was that Balasingham\'s remarks </p><p>were about as far as the LTTE has ever gone in </p><p>indicating that it would settle for less than an "Eelam" </p><p>or separate Tamil state in the north and east. </p><p>K. Loganathan of the Center for Policy Alternatives told </p><p>us that he thought Balasingham\'s remarks were "quite </p><p>important, as they indicated the LTTE might be willing </p><p>to work within the `united Sri Lanka\' concept."  Even </p><p>Presidential spokesman Harim Peiris, who is otherwise </p><p>quite critical of the LTTE, welcomed Balasingham\'s </p><p>remarks, commenting that it was a "potentially positive </p><p>announcement that needs to be studied further." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) (((Note:  There was some skepticism about </p><p>Balasingham\'s comments, however.  A representative of </p><p>the radical Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna publicly blasted </p><p>Balasingham, asserting that "the LTTE is simply making </p><p>its original demand for separatism in another way." </p><p>Dayan Jayatilleke, a local press commentator with </p><p>Sinhalese extremist leanings, was also dubious, accusing </p><p>"the pro-peace crowd of making a big deal over </p><p>nothing."))) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The talks seem to have met local expectations in </p><p>every way.  Balasingham\'s comments, which received so </p><p>much press coverage, were a decided bonus for the </p><p>government, strengthening its position in the south vis- </p><p>a-vis Sinhalese hard-liners.  (Note:  Balasingham\'s </p><p>comments could easily be seen as the LTTE\'s quid pro quo </p><p>response to the GSL\'s recent decision to lift its ban on </p><p>the LTTE.  The GSL had been seeking something in return </p><p>for its politically risky announcement.  It is not clear </p><p>whether Balasingham cleared his remarks with his boss, </p><p>Prabhakaran, but it would have been dangerous not to. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) With the peace process steadily gaining </p><p>traction, Sri Lanka is rapidly becoming a changed </p><p>country.  While the wounds of the nearly 20-year </p><p>conflict are not even close to healed, Sri Lanka has </p><p>come a long way very quickly, becoming much less tense </p><p>and optimistic in the process.  The flip side of this is </p><p>that if expectations are dashed the negative reaction </p><p>could be a powerful one.  End Comment. </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
