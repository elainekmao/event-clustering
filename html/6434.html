<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000546 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC MASS ACTION IMMINENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 516 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MDC finally calls for mass action </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) After a year of careful planning, the opposition </p><p>Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has, for the first time </p><p>since the flawed 2002 presidential election,  issued a public </p><p>call for Zimbabweans to participate in mass action, beginning </p><p>on March 18 and 19.   In full-page advertisements carried in </p><p>the independent newspapers, the MDC calls for "peaceful </p><p>action carefully calculated to express discontent and disgust </p><p>with the state of affairs within our nation...We must take up </p><p>the challenge and engage in the most visible form of </p><p>democratic resistance until our rights, freedoms, and dignity </p><p>and the right to live in peace are won back."   The party has </p><p>gotten the message out in a number of ways, including via </p><p>special mass action structures established in most of the </p><p>country\'s urban centers and distribution of large numbers of </p><p>pamphlets.  In a March 15 interview with the independent </p><p>weekly, "The Standard," MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai </p><p>confirmed that mass action had been called for March 18 and </p><p>19, but he declined to be drawn on what forms it would take. </p><p> </p><p>Possibility of violence </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Concerned by reports that some elements of the MDC </p><p>were planning violent attacks against security service </p><p>installations (reftel), the Ambassador urged restraint in a </p><p>March 17 meeting with Tsvangirai.  The Ambassador told the </p><p>MDC leader that the U.S. Government supported the right of </p><p>the MDC and civil society to engage in  peaceful forms of </p><p>mass action but counseled strongly against violent </p><p>confrontation.  Such an approach would take away any claim </p><p>the MDC had to the moral high ground and give the GOZ an </p><p>excuse to crush the opposition.  Tsvangirai agreed, said the </p><p>party was encouraging only peaceful activities and that the </p><p>first phase to begin on March 18 was a work stayaway, with </p><p>the possibility of peaceful demonstrations in some </p><p>localities, but no march in downtown Harare as yet.  The </p><p>party might proceed to broader demonstrations depending on </p><p>what happens on March 18 and 19. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  In a separate conversation with the DCM and </p><p>polchief, MDC Member of Parliament and National Executive </p><p>member Tendai Biti said he was not privy to all of the </p><p>activities planned.  He reported, however, that MDC youths </p><p>are planning to stone or burn commuter omnibuses which </p><p>attempt to transport people to work in the city center.  He </p><p>said the stayaway would likely be accompanied by </p><p>demonstrations in the high-density suburbs, and that some </p><p>groups of people might try to carry their protests to the </p><p>city center.  Biti noted that the MDC is currently drawing up </p><p>a list of businesses owned by ZANU-PF officials or party </p><p>donors for the purposes of organizing a boycott.  Organizing </p><p>a boycott of the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe, run by ZANU-PF </p><p>stalwart Gideon Gono, would be fairly easy, Biti claimed, as </p><p>Zimbabweans have many other banking options.  He pointed out, </p><p>however, that it might be more difficult to convince people </p><p>to shun other businesses which produce the basic commodities </p><p>which are in such short supply these days. </p><p> </p><p>Stayaway participation </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Meanwhile, many businesses we have checked with have </p><p>confirmed that they plan either to close on March 18 and 19 </p><p>or to allow employees to miss work without sacrificing pay, </p><p>motivated by concern for the safety of their workers who live </p><p>in the high-density suburbs.  At the same time, some </p><p>businessmen with whom we spoke were wary of taking any action </p><p>that might be interpreted by ruling party enforcers as </p><p>support for the stayaway.  Contemplating that many of our </p><p>FSN\'s who live in high-density suburbs might have difficulty </p><p>getting to work on these two days, the Embassy has announced </p><p>a liberal leave policy. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The MDC has worked intensively during the past year </p><p>to establish structures in most of Zimbabwe\'s urban centers </p><p>capable of organizing mass action.  The fact that Tsvangirai, </p><p>who has been under enormous pressure to take such a step for </p><p>much of the past year, has now called for mass action </p><p>suggests he believes that the necessary organization is in </p><p>place and that the eminently patient Zimbabwean population, </p><p>angered by political repression and the economic implosion, </p><p>are finally ready to demonstrate their displeasure.  During </p><p>the past several months, the MDC has planned a number of </p><p>small-scale protests in Harare\'s high-density suburbs -- at </p><p>bus stations, police stations, and food queues -- and appears </p><p>ready to broaden these activities. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of </p><p>the March 18-19 stayaway, the fact that some employers have </p><p>promised not to dock their employees\' pay and the fact that </p><p>many Zimbabweans have been urging the MDC to organize such an </p><p>action for some time now, increase the chances for a </p><p>successful stayaway.  While recent labor union calls for </p><p>stayaways have flopped, the MDC has prepared the current </p><p>action more carefully and is seen by more Zimbabweans as the </p><p>embodiment of hope for change.  And while the MDC evinces </p><p>confidence about this action\'s prospects for success, the </p><p>party also is aware of the risks and high costs of failure. </p><p>We are concerned about the possibility of violence and have </p><p>counseled the MDC at many levels, from Tsvangirai down, not </p><p>to initiate violence.  Although the MDC leadership regularly </p><p>insists to us that it is pursing political change through </p><p>peaceful means, we cannot rule out the possibility of </p><p>spontaneous outbreaks of violence associated with the </p><p>stayaway.  Security forces are on high alert and will seek to </p><p>frustrate any organized MDC action. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
