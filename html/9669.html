<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEFT FOR SA, SA/INS, T, AND PM </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KTIA, PREL, PGOV, PINR, NP, Nepali Government Policy </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT ENTERS INTO FORCE </p><p> </p><p>REP: 2002 KATHMANDU 2505 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On July 22, 2003, Nepal\'s Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs sent a diplomatic note to the Embassy, </p><p>informing us that the Government of Nepal (GON) has </p><p>completed the necessary domestic legal requirements </p><p>for entry into force of the Article 98 Agreement.  The </p><p>Agreement, signed in Kathmandu on December 31, 2002 </p><p>(reftel), required the parties to exchange diplomatic </p><p>notes confirming that domestic law supported the </p><p>Agreement.  The Embassy reminded the GON of this </p><p>obligation by diplomatic note on June 26.  The Embassy </p><p>will fax both Diplomatic Notes to the Nepal Desk </p><p>(SA/INS). </p><p>2.  (SBU) Comment:  The GON chose to utilize </p><p>provisions in Article IX of its Treaty Act to meet the </p><p>domestic legal provisions of the Agreement.  The Act </p><p>states that any international treaty signed by the GON </p><p>shall supersede domestic law.  As Nepal does not have </p><p>a Parliament and no planned elections, the Treaty Act </p><p>was the simplest means to ensure compliance with the </p><p>Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
