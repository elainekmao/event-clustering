FINN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 15. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary: From April 22 to 29, Texas-based Fidelity </p><p>International was in Kabul to pursue a $1.8 billion cement </p><p>deal with the Afghan government.  Substantial progress was </p><p>made, including the granting of an investment license by the </p><p>High Commission for Investment.  Given the size and impact of </p><p>the proposed deal, the terms are being reviewed at the </p><p>highest levels of the Afghan government.  Among the chief </p><p>Afghan concerns was Fidelity,s request for market </p><p>exclusivity that they perceive will create a &monopoly8 in </p><p>the cement sector.  Fidelity, for its part, appears willing </p><p>to negotiate but is growing frustrated by what it views as </p><p>the Afghan government renegotiating the deal repeatedly due </p><p>to unclear decision-making authority.  A four-minister Task </p><p>Force led by the Minister of Reconstruction is currently </p><p>preparing the Afghan government,s counterproposal to </p><p>Fidelity,s terms.  The Task Force is scheduled to complete </p><p>its work and offer its counterproposal o/a May 7.  Despite </p><p>many ups and downs, the deal for this critically needed </p><p>investment in a key reconstruction sector is still very much </p><p>alive.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The principal investors from Fidelity International </p><p>visited Kabul from April 22 to 29.  Fidelity International,s </p><p>management team includes several of the American businessmen </p><p>who made up the failed Box-Alcali cement investment proposal </p><p>that has languished in the Ministry of Mines and Industries </p><p>since March 2002.  The new firm, Fidelity, now includes W. </p><p>Tompie Hall, whose experience includes reconstruction efforts </p><p>in post-Gulf War Kuwait in the early 1990s.  Box </p><p>International is now responsible for the feasibility study </p><p>and the operation of the cement factories.  Box,s former </p><p>Turkish joint venture partner, Alcali, is no longer involved </p><p>in the project.  In advance of this visit, Fidelity </p><p>Representatives Tompie Hall and Terry Ritter met with </p><p>officials at the Departments of State and Commerce.  In </p><p>addition, they made clear early on that they wanted to work </p><p>closely with the Embassy ) an omission from the Box-Alcali </p><p>proposal that they wished to remedy. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Substantial progress was made between 4/22 and 4/29. </p><p>The negative feelings that the failed Box-Alcali deal had </p><p>created were overcome.  (Note: The Box-Alcali deal rubbed </p><p>both Minister Ghani and the late Minister of Mines and </p><p>Industry Mohammedi the wrong way due to lease provisions </p><p>which conveyed the required land for one dollar.  Also, the </p><p>Alcali side of the deal employed a purported fixer who </p><p>misrepresented his influence with the Afghan government and </p><p>raised suspicions of Box-Alcali,s legitimacy through his </p><p>clumsy application of political pressure.  End note.)  The </p><p>Fidelity team met early on with the Ambassador and the </p><p>Minister of Commerce.  The Minister of Commerce discussed the </p><p>message immediately with President Karzai, who strongly </p><p>supported the project.  Karzai appointed Minister of </p><p>Reconstruction Farhang to finalize the deal. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Minister Farhang convened a meeting on April 23 to </p><p>hear the proposal,s terms in detail and raise preliminary </p><p>points requiring further discussion.  In addition to </p><p>Fidelity,s senior and in-country representatives and </p><p>Econ/Commoff, also attending were Acting Minister of Mines </p><p>and Industry Nadi, Minister of Commerce Kazemi and working </p><p>level representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>and the Ministry of Planning.  Fidelity presented its </p><p>proposal, which called for the creation of the National </p><p>Afghan Cement Company, in which the Afghan Government would </p><p>hold a 15 percent share.  The project was set to begin with a </p><p>program for rehabilitating one of the two defunct state-owned </p><p>cement factories in Pol-e Khomri while concurrently </p><p>conducting feasibility studies for the construction of three </p><p>other cement factories in other regions of the country. </p><p>Fidelity was prepared to provide a 25MW power plant for each </p><p>factory.  In addition, Fidelity was prepared to develop, </p><p>excavate and transport required raw materias ) all of which </p><p>it was prepared to pay for at fair market rates.  Fidelity </p><p>estimated that the project would create 8,000 direct jobs and </p><p>up to 90,000 indirect jobs.  The total estimated investment </p><p>for the four factories is $1.8bn. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) While the Afghan government representatives had </p><p>several technical issues of concern, the only truly </p><p>contentious issue was Fidelity,s request for market </p><p>exclusivity for its product.  Fidelity maintained that, since </p><p>it would essentially develop the entire infrastructure for </p><p>the cement industry in Afghanistan, it would be unfair to </p><p>allow others to come in later and take advantage of all of </p><p>Fidelity,s preparatory work and significant investment. </p><p>Also, Fidelity was concerned over the continued Pakistani </p><p>practice of predatory cement dumping on the Afghan market and </p><p>its negative effect on its expected market share.  In </p><p>response to Afghan concerns over monopoly, Fidelity insisted </p><p>that it would maintain a fair market price for their cement. </p><p>Fidelity added that the commercial viability of the project </p><p>would be eroded substantially without such a provision. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) After making the changes requested by the Afghan side, </p><p>including revised exclusivity terms, Fidelity presented their </p><p>&conveyance agreement8 and investment license for approval </p><p>to the High Commission for Investment.  On April 26, the High </p><p>Commission for Investment called in Fidelity, joined by the </p><p>Econ/Commoff, for a review of its license application.  The </p><p>High Commission was composed of the Minister of Commerce, the </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Reconstruction, </p><p>the Acting Minister of Mines and Industry, the Minister of </p><p>Justice, and the Deputy Minister of Planning.  After </p><p>extensive discussion with the Fidelity parties over the terms </p><p>of the agreement, mostly pertaining to the still-troublesome </p><p>&monopoly8 provisions contained in the agreement, the High </p><p>Commission convened privately and approved the investment </p><p>license. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) After informing Fidelity that their license was </p><p>approved by the HCI, Fidelity sought clarification of the </p><p>meaning of the license and accompanying agreement ) was it </p><p>merely an MOU or did it constitute a binding contract?  The </p><p>HCI responded that the license and attached agreement was </p><p>only an MOU.  Fidelity responded that a binding agreement </p><p>would be required to arrange necessary financing for the </p><p>deal.  The HCI concluded that for the agreement to constitute </p><p>a contract, given the size and impact of the deal, it would </p><p>have to be reviewed by the &Coordination Council8 ) a </p><p>senior body chaired by President Karzai, which apparently </p><p>served as an economic version of the National Security </p><p>Council.  For this to be possible, the HCI requested that </p><p>Fidelity have the agreement translated into Dari for </p><p>presentation and review by the Ministry of Justice and the </p><p>Ministry of Mines and Industry the following day.  Justice </p><p>wanted to make certain that the appropriate Dari terms were </p><p>used in the agreement, and Mines and Industries wanted to </p><p>confirm that the &technical terms8 were clear. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) On April 27, the Coordination Council deliberated over </p><p>the Fidelity agreement.  Vice President Amin Arsala served as </p><p>President Karzai,s representative for the meeting.  The </p><p>Coordination Council raised additional concerns, including: </p><p>needing additional bona fides for the Fidelity principals; </p><p>clarifying language defining TISA responsibilities to support </p><p>the project ) which could be interpreted as creating a </p><p>sovereign guarantee; specifying raw materials involved; </p><p>providing a more specific definition of what the 15% Afghan </p><p>government share entailed; resolving outstanding loans due to </p><p>the former Czechoslovakia on the Pol-e Khomri factories ($20m </p><p>and $40m); overcoming lingering concerns about monopoly </p><p>terms; and establishing performance benchmarks. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Coordination Council created a task force to </p><p>prepare the Afghan governments rejoinder to Fidelity,s </p><p>proposed terms within 10 days.  The task force was led by </p><p>Minister of Reconstruction Farhang and included the Ministers </p><p>of Light Industries, Urban Development, and Mines & </p><p>Industries Ministers.  The Fidelity principles, Mr. Hall and </p><p>Mr. Ritter left Kabul the day after the Coordination Council </p><p>meeting frustrated by their perception that the Afghan </p><p>government kept reopening previously negotiated terms.  They </p><p>were reluctant to continue negotiations for much longer. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Daoud Yaqoub of the National Security Council </p><p>contacted Econ/Commoff on 4/28 to discuss the status of the </p><p>Fidelity deal.  Daoud met briefly with Econ/Commoff and then </p><p>accompanied him to a meeting with Minister Farhang.  Farhang </p><p>emphasized that the deal was still alive, and that the TISA </p><p>only wanted to ensure that it was fair to Afghanistan. </p><p>Farhang noted that he felt 90-95 percent sure that there </p><p>would be a positive result within 10 days.  Farhang wrote to </p><p>Mr. Tompie Hall on May 4 thanking him for Fidelity,s visit </p><p>and explaining the task force,s efforts to resolve </p><p>outstanding issues.  Farhang concluded by saying: Begin </p><p>quote: I would like to stress that the government of </p><p>Afghanistan views your proposal favorably and wishes to see </p><p>implementation as soon as possible and we look forward to </p><p>resolving the few remaining issues so that this urgently </p><p>needed work can commence.  End quote. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Meanwhile, the German advisor to the TISA on trade </p><p>and investment issues, Dr. Stephen Kinneman, returned to </p><p>Kabul from Germany and reviewed the agreement.  Kinneman,s </p><p>conclusion was that the deal was not sufficiently fair to the </p><p>Afghan side.  In a May 5 meeting with Ambassador, Kinneman </p><p>spelled out his concerns over the deal as presently </p><p>structured.  While Kinneman acknowledged that such a sizable </p><p>investment would greatly benefit Afghanistan and that under </p><p>current conditions Afghanistan would have to offer premium </p><p>terms to attract capital, the agreement was nonetheless too </p><p>slanted towards Fidelity.  His chief concern was the creation </p><p>of a &quasi-monopoly8 for NACC.  Kinneman was also </p><p>concerned that the agreement lacked performance benchmarks, </p><p>offered no guarantees regarding job creation, and placed </p><p>undue burdens on the Afghan government.  Ambassador agreed </p><p>that foreign investment was absolutely essential to </p><p>rebuilding Afghanistan.  This was the only way to introduce </p><p>Afghanistan to modern open economic practices and overcome </p><p>command economy mindsets.  While the deal may not be fairly </p><p>balanced, it was, however, more likely the Afghan </p><p>government,s lack of experience and expertise in negotiating </p><p>terms was more to blame for the imbalance than any </p><p>overreaching by Fidelity.  Econ/Commoff added that </p><p>international businesses could hardly be expected to </p><p>negotiate against themselves to make their terms more </p><p>attractive for Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) What Kinnemann suggested was for the Afghan </p><p>government to employ legal counsel with sufficient expertise </p><p>to gain more balanced terms for Afghanistan ) not only for </p><p>the Fidelity deal, but for all such investment deals. </p><p>Kinneman suggested this would be possible through pro-bono </p><p>work by interested attorneys.  Kinneman confirmed to </p><p>Ambassador that he was not opposed to the project as a German </p><p>who was looking for German firms to enter the market ) he </p><p>simply wanted the deal to be fair for Afghanistan. </p><p>Econ/Commoff noted that Afghanistan could not expect 50/50 </p><p>balance in terms ) otherwise investors could seek such </p><p>returns in much more secure markets.  Kinneman agreed, noting </p><p>that something closer to 70/30 would be preferable.  If the </p><p>current deal could be portrayed as unreasonably slanted in </p><p>favor of Fidelity, Ambassador concluded that private advice </p><p>might help Afghanistan remedy this imbalance. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Concerns about Fidelity,s bona fides are rumored to </p><p>have arisen during TISA discussions of the deal, although </p><p>internal Embassy background checks uncovered no derogatory </p><p>information.  Econ/Commoff has asked Fidelity,s in-country </p><p>representatives to secure additional biographic and </p><p>background materials on both Fidelity officials and investors </p><p>involved in raising the substantial capital the deal purports </p><p>to deliver.  Fidelity has asked that the Department </p><p>discretely relay the information regarding their investors to </p><p>the Embassy for the Ambassador,s information.  On May 2, </p><p>Fidelity forwarded additional biographic materials (C.V.s and </p><p>company information) to Embassy, which were passed to </p><p>Fidelity, who provided them to the Ministry of </p><p>Reconstruction.  The reason bona fides have taken such </p><p>prominence in this case is that Fidelity is a new company </p><p>created to pursue this project and other similar </p><p>reconstruction-related projects in the region.  As such, </p><p>company history is lacking.  Therefore, the Afghan government </p><p>will place substantially more weight on the bona fides of </p><p>Fidelity officials and investors. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Action Request: Embassy requests that Department </p><p>forward any such information received from Fidelity through </p><p>secure media to Ambassador and/or Econ/Commoff for </p><p>appropriate use. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Comment: The Task Force,s response was due on May 7. </p><p> Post will provide status updates at appropriate intervals. </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
