SUMMARY: A top Kuwaiti official said Kuwait welcomes </p><p>the ceasefire by three Palestinian factions saying, "Hamas\' </p><p>position has changed, and we welcome this positive change." </p><p>One commentator writes that Israel bears most of the </p><p>responsibility for whether the ceasefire will lead to a </p><p>lasting settlement. Another sees the World Economic Forum </p><p>meeting held in Jordan last week as part of a "Great Road </p><p>Map" in support of a "Zionist-American project to create a </p><p>new Middle East. to be integrated into the Zionist economy." </p><p> </p><p>Two commentators address the issue of reform in the region, </p><p>feeling that change is necessary to combat terrorism and to </p><p>"modernize." On the news pages, the Ministry of Education </p><p>announced an effort to "review" the educational curricula in </p><p>Kuwaiti schools. </p><p> </p><p>In the lead-up to parliamentary elections, a vote-buying </p><p>scandal was exposed this week, and one daily published the </p><p>conservative Islamist Salafi Movement\'s platform that </p><p>includes planks on gender segregation in schools and an end </p><p>to foreign troops in Kuwait. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: Al-Rai Al-Aam reports that Sheikh Khaled </p><p>Salman Al-Jarallah, Undersecretary of the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs, said Kuwait welcomes the cease-fire, and: </p><p>"Kuwait\'s official position towards Hamas has not changed. </p><p>Rather, Hamas\' position has changed, and we welcome this </p><p>positive change." </p><p> </p><p>On June 28, Al-Qabas front-paged a vote-buying scandal in </p><p>which a parliamentary candidate was caught receiving money </p><p>from a constituent. The candidate, who was reportedly paying </p><p>KD 500 (approximately USD 1500) to those who would vote for </p><p>him, will face criminal charges. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam published an outline of the "the reformist </p><p>vision" of the conservative Islamist Salafi Movement </p><p>electoral platform which includes: the removal of foreign </p><p>military presence from Kuwait; the development of Kuwait\'s </p><p>unexploited northern oil fields "without the hegemony of </p><p>foreign companies;" and the segregation of students by </p><p>gender at all educational levels, including at foreign </p><p>schools. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan published comments by a conservative parliamentary </p><p>candidate saying, "liberals cover up their weaknesses by </p><p>levelling accusations against Islamists." Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>reports that another candidate stated that, "Privatization </p><p>is a Jewish scheme for taking over the region." </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports that Mubarak Al-Mutawa, a Kuwaiti </p><p>human rights activist and the Secretary General of the </p><p>International Islamic Committee for Human Rights, stated at </p><p>a human rights conference in Belgium that, "Kuwait\'s </p><p>reputation in the sphere of human rights is very good." </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan reports on June 30 public comments by the Assistant </p><p>Undersecretary for Educational Research and Curriculm of the </p><p>Ministry of Education, Dr. Mohammad Al-Musaileen announcing </p><p>a Ministry plan to review the Kuwaiti educational curricula </p><p>to "explore the strengths and the weaknesses" of the current </p><p>curricula. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports on June 30 that the Council of Ministers </p><p>ratified draft Amiri Decrees for the establishment of four </p><p>private universities and colleges in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "Terrorism\'s Warm Havens" </p><p>Saud Al-Samaka wrote in independent Al-Qabas (6/28):  "Our </p><p>schools are overflowing with terrorist culture, and sources </p><p>of financing [for terrorists in the Gulf] are limitless. Our </p><p>government admits that there are hundreds of charitable </p><p>committees collecting money without any legal cover. The </p><p>locomotive of change is drawing near, and Iraq will be the </p><p>model of this coming era of progress. Therefore, we must be </p><p>prepared for what is coming and deal with it with </p><p>transparency." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Separation of Powers" </p><p>Liberal editor-in-chief Mohammed Al-Jassim wrote in </p><p>independent Al-Watan (6/28):  "The stability of a political </p><p>system is vital for development. Our country paid dearly for </p><p>instability. Since the beginning of the constitutional era, </p><p>we have argued about democracy, the constitution and the </p><p>freedom of press in vain. Despite all appearances of </p><p>progress and prosperity, the problem is upon us." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The Great Road Map" </p><p>Hamed Al-Ali wrote in independent Al-Watan (6/28):  "How can </p><p>this criminal entity [Israel] continue to violate all that </p><p>other countries are asked to respect, be it on human rights </p><p>issues, WMD, UN resolutions, or impinging on other </p><p>countries\' sovereignty, and still have a leading role at the </p><p>recent [World Economic Forum] held in Amman? It was clear </p><p>that America and the Zionist entity were the main two </p><p>players. [and that] the Zionist-American project wants to </p><p>create a new Middle East to serve as a `supermarket\' to be </p><p>integrated into the Zionist economy. The role of the Zionist- </p><p>Americans is to see the implementation of the Great Road </p><p>Map, with the Zionists in control." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Map, If You Please" </p><p>Liberal Salah Al-Sayer wrote in independent Al-Anba (6/28): </p><p>"Many Gulf citizens believe in the status quo, and don\'t </p><p>consider the need for a reform road map presented by the </p><p>American Administration. To believe in the status quo is to </p><p>be shortsighted. The region is in flux, constants are </p><p>changing rapidly, and therefore, it is wise to pick up the </p><p>threads of change. The Gulf region is no exception: it is </p><p>ideologically antiquated like the rest of the region and in </p><p>need of a road map of reforms to modernize it. Events in </p><p>Iraq affirm that America is a close neighbor, and a big </p><p>sister." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Loyalty to the Coalition" </p><p>Naser Al-Otaibi wrote in independent Al-Seyassah ((6/29): </p><p>"The liberation of Iraq from the grip of a tyrant after </p><p>thirty-five years is God\'s blessing, and a great victory for </p><p>the Iraqi people. This could not have been realized without </p><p>the courage of President Bush and the support of Prime </p><p>Minister Tony Blair. People of Iraq, do not rush the </p><p>departure of the coalition forces, because if they leave the </p><p>forces of evil will rise again." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "For the Truce to Achieve Peace." </p><p>Dr. Ayed Al-Manaa wrote in independent Al-Watan (6/30): </p><p>"The success of the truce between the Palestinians and </p><p>Israelis which was mediated by the United States, is a </p><p>positive step. This truce can be a permanent window to </p><p>peace. Israel bears most of the responsibility since it is </p><p>the one that usurps Palestinian land, including Jerusalem, </p><p>refuses the return of Palestinian refugees, and builds </p><p>illegal settlements. Therefore, if Israel seriously commits </p><p>itself to the truce, not only will it win American and </p><p>European approval, but also successive Arab recognition, and </p><p>will gradually emerge from regional isolation. If not, then </p><p>a new window of hell will open and only extremists from both </p><p>sides will benefit." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "The American-Iranian Dispute" </p><p>Dr. Shamlan Al-Issa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (6/30): </p><p>"It is not in the interests of Gulf countries for the </p><p>American-Iranian dispute to escalate. However, the United </p><p>States will not pursue a new war in the region, especially </p><p>as President Bush is heading towards elections in seventeen </p><p>months. His main focus now is to improve the economy in his </p><p>country in order to win public opinion and votes." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
