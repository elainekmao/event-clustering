<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 PARIS 34022 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PINR, SU, FR </p><p>SUBJECT:  FRANCE ON SUDAN: SHOW US PROOF OF TERRORIST </p><p>          SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 277307 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  QUAI OFFICIALS STATE THEY ARE NOT FIRMLY </p><p>CONVINCED OF SUDANESE SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM, AND ASK </p><p>FOR FIRMER PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF TRAINING CAMPS. </p><p>THEY STRESS THAT THE POVERTY OF SUDAN, IN THEIR VIEW, </p><p>PREVENTS IT FROM BEING A SUPPORTER OF TERRORISM IN THE </p><p>FASHION OF A LIBYA OR AN IRAN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUDANESE TOO POOR TO SUPPORT TERRORISM? </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  QUAI DIRECTOR FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN AFRICAN </p><p>AFFAIRS BERNADETTE LE FORT AND SUDAN DESKOFF RAJA RABIA </p><p>TOLD VISITING INR TERRORISM ANALYST GINA BENNETT </p><p>DECEMBER 8 THAT THE FRENCH BELIEVE THE SUDANESE LACK </p><p>THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO SUPPORT TERRORISM.  LE FORT </p><p>MENTIONED THAT IN THE PAST, TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE </p><p>TYPICALLY HAD SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FROM A STATE, SUCH AS </p><p>IRAN OR LIBYA, AND THAT SUDAN QUITE SIMPLY LACKED THE </p><p>SAME SORT OF RESOURCES THAT THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  LE FORT SAID THE FRENCH HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE ARE </p><p>UPWARDS OF 23 CAMPS AROUND KHARTOUM.  THEY ALSO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT BIN LADEN, A SAUDI STRIPPED OF HIS </p><p>CITIZENSHIP WHO IS STILL A PATRON TO SOME TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS, HAS A NUMBER OF SO-CALLED FARMS IN SOUTHERN </p><p>SUDAN.  SHE ADDED THAT THE FRENCH DO NOT BELIEVE ANY </p><p>SERIOUS "MILITARY" TRAINING WAS TAKING PLACE IN SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FRENCH FEEL SUDAN NOT AN "ACTIVE" SUPPORTER OF TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  LE FORT SAID THAT FRANCE WAS CONCERNED BY THE </p><p>"SYMBOLIC MEANING" OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM IN SUDAN </p><p>TO SUBSAHARAN AFRICA, BUT HAD NO EVIDENCE THAT SUDAN IS </p><p>"ACTIVELY" SUPPORTING TERRORISM.  "WE FOLLOW SOME </p><p>GROUPS CAREFULLY, AND WORRY MORE ABOUT THEIR MORAL </p><p>INFLUENCE MORE THAN THEIR ACTIVE INFLUENCE," SHE SAID. </p><p>SHE OPINED THAT MOST COUNTRIES TERRORISM PROBLEMS ARE </p><p>HOMEGROWN, CITING ALGERIA AS AN EXAMPLE.  SHE ALSO </p><p>MENTIONED SUDAN\'S PERMEABLE BORDERS AND SUGGESTED THERE </p><p>MIGHT BE ACTIVITIES WITHIN SUDAN THAT ARE UNKNOWN TO </p><p>ITS GOVERNMENT.  SHE SAID THAT FRANCE NEVERTHELESS </p><p>REMAINS "VERY FIRM" IN ITS DEALINGS WITH THE SUDANESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  RABIA MENTIONED SEPARATELY THAT THE GOF </p><p>CONSIDERS TURABI "DANGEROUS", AND THAT FRANCE SHOULD IN </p><p>NO WAY BE CONSIDERED A SUPPORTER OF THE SUDANESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FRENCH ASK TO SEE EVIDENCE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  LE FORT ASKED WHETHER THE USG HAS SPECIFIC EVIDENCE </p><p>OF TRAINING OF HAMAS IN SUDAN, AND WHETHER THE USG </p><p>COULD SHARE CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF </p><p>TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS IN SUDAN.  RABIA MENTIONED </p><p>THAT SUCH EVIDENCE WOULD BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO </p><p>FRANCE DURING ITS PRESIDENCY OF THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WE RESPONDED THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS ANY </p><p>LONGER THE CASE THAT TERRORIST GROUPS NEED A MAJOR </p><p>STATE SPONSOR OR EVEN EASILY IDENTIFIABLE TRAINING </p><p>CAMPS, IN ORDER TO TO CARRY OUT THEIR ACTIVITIES, </p><p>CITING THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBERS AS EXAMPLES.  WE </p><p>REITERATED THAT WE VIEWED THE HARBORING OF TERRORISTS </p><p>AND PERMITTING THEM TO TRAIN IN SUDAN AS SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TERRORISM.  WE SAID WE WOULD PASS ON THE FRENCH REQUEST </p><p>TO SEE MORE CONCRETE EVIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  THIS IS THE FIRST SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION WE HAVE </p><p>HAD IN RESPONSE TO OUR DEMARCHE ON TERRORISM IN SUDAN </p><p>(REF).  WE AND THE FRENCH ARE SEEING SOME OF THE SAME </p><p>FACTS (I.E. THE EXISTENCE OF CAMPS AND THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>KNOWN TERRORISTS IN SUDAN), BUT ARE ASCRIBING DIFFERENT </p><p>MEANINGS TO THEM.  THE FRENCH MAY HAVE MORE OF AN </p><p>AGENDA IN SUDAN THAN THEY ARE WILLING TO SHARE WITH </p><p>US.  ONE WELL-INFORMED NON-GOVERNMENT SOURCE SUGGESTS </p><p>FRANCE WANTS TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH TURABI ET </p><p>AL., IN THE HOPE OF USING SUDAN TO MODERATE ISLAMISTS </p><p>IN ALGERIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BOHLEN </p><p></p></div>
