IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: IN AN HOUR-LONG MARCH 27 MEETING, THE </p><p>RECENTLY FIRED EDITOR OF THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED DAILY </p><p>"THE HERALD" SPOKE OPENLY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S USE </p><p>OF THE PAPER AS A PROPAGANDA TOOL.  FORMER "HERALD" </p><p>EDITOR RAY MUNGOSHI (35) (PROTECT) TOLD EMBOFF ABOUT </p><p>DAILY HARASSMENT FROM INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN </p><p>MOYO, THE MINISTER\'S ACTIVE SUBVERSION OF HIS </p><p>EDITORSHIP, THE MINISTER\'S EFFORTS TO PLANT FALSE </p><p>STORIES IN THE NEWSPAPER, CRUMBLING MORALE AT THE </p><p>PAPER AND MUNGOSHI\'S FEARS THAT MOYO\'S DETERMINATION </p><p>TO RUN THE PAPER WILL END UP DESTROYING IT.  WHILE </p><p>MUNGOSHI\'S ACCOUNT LIKELY INCLUDED SOME EMBELLISHMENT </p><p>OF HIS ROLE IN DEFENSE OF MEDIA FREEDOM, HIS ACCOUNT </p><p>OF DIRECT CABINET-LEVEL INTERFERENCE IN THE NEWSPAPER </p><p>RING THOROUGHLY TRUE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) RAY MUNGOSHI\'S EDITORSHIP OF THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>OWNED AND CONTROLLED "HERALD" LASTED ONLY 7 MONTHS. </p><p>HE WAS APPOINTED EDITOR ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2000, AND </p><p>SACKED ON MARCH 14, 2001.  HE SUCCEEDED BORNWELL </p><p>CHAKAODZA, WHO HAD BEEN EDITOR FOR TWO-AND-A-HALF </p><p>YEARS.  INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO SACKED </p><p>CHAKAODZA FOR HIS ATTEMPTS TO REBUILD THE "HERALD\'S" </p><p>CREDIBILITY AFTER ITS SHAMELESSLY PARTISAN COVERAGE OF </p><p>THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY CAMPAIGN AND ELECTION. </p><p>(NOTE: BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01177  01 OF 02  301119Z </p><p>FEBRUARY 2000 AND THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IN LATE- </p><p>JUNE 2000, THE HERALD\'S DAILY CIRCULATION PLUMMETED </p><p>FROM ABOUT 80,000 TO ABOUT 40,000.  CHAKAODZA\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE EDITORIAL INTEGRITY OF THE </p><p>PAPER WERE DRIVEN BY FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS NEEDS. </p><p>HIS POLICIES DID SUCCEED IN RAISING THE CIRCULATION OF </p><p>THE "HERALD" BACK TO AROUND 70,000 COPIES PER DAY. </p><p>END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO MUNGOSHI, HE ACCEPTED THE JOB </p><p>DETERMINED TO CONSOLIDATE RECENT GAINS IN CIRCULATION </p><p>AND KEEP THE "HERALD" FINANCIALLY VIABLE BY DEFENDING </p><p>IT FROM GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE.  INITIALLY, HE SAID, </p><p>ZIMPAPERS (THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR ALL GOVERNMENT- </p><p>OWNED NEWSPAPERS) MANAGING DIRECTOR TOMMY SITHOLE </p><p>SHIELDED HIM FROM THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION.  THAT </p><p>DID NOT LAST, HOWEVER, AND BY DECEMBER AND THE ZANU-PF </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS, INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO </p><p>CALLED MUNGOSHI ON AN ALMOST DAILY BASIS, USUALLY AT </p><p>ABOUT 0600 IN THE MORNING.  MUNGOSHI SAID THAT THESE </p><p>CALLS OFTEN LASTED 30 TO 45 MINUTES, AND WERE OFTEN </p><p>ANGRY DIATRIBES ABOUT THE "HERALD\'S" LACK OF SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE GOVERNMENT.  MOYO ALSO USED THESE PHONE CALLS </p><p>TO TELL MUNGOSHI WHAT THE NEXT DAY\'S EDITORIAL SHOULD </p><p>BE, OR WHAT STORY HE WANTED TO SEE ON THE FIRST PAGE. </p><p>MUNGOSHI SAID THAT HE STOOD UP TO MOYO WHENEVER HE </p><p>COULD, BUT CONFESSED THAT THE PRESSURE WAS SOMETIMES </p><p>TOO MUCH AND HE WOULD "LIE LOW" FOR A WEEK OR TWO JUST </p><p>TO STOP THE EARLY MORNING RANTING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MUNGOSHI ALSO TOLD US THAT MINISTER MOYO WOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01177  01 OF 02  301119Z </p><p>SEND READY-TO-PRINT STORIES TO THE PAPER AND EXPECT TO </p><p>SEE THEM PUBLISHED WITHOUT QUESTION OR ALTERATIONS. </p><p>HE DESCRIBED ONE SPECIFIC INCIDENT IN WHICH MOYO SENT </p><p>A STORY ALLEGING THAT LEADING ZIMBABWEAN BUSINESSMAN </p><p>STRIVE MASIYIWA (ECONET CELLULAR) WAS INVOLVED IN </p><p>ILLEGAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALINGS.  MUNGOSHI, WHO </p><p>KNOWS THE BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIAN MASIYIWA AND BELIEVES </p><p>HIM TO BE AN HONEST, LAW-ABIDING MAN, DETAILED TWO </p><p>REPORTERS TO CONFIRM THE DETAILS OF THE STORY.  THE </p><p>REPORTERS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO BASIS TO THE </p><p>STORY, SO MUNGOSHI REFUSED TO RUN IT.  THAT DECISION </p><p>PROMPTED A BARRAGE OF VERBAL ABUSE FROM MOYO, WHO </p><p>APPARENTLY TOLD MUNGOSHI THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO </p><p>QUESTION ANY STORIES MOYO WISHED TO HAVE PUBLISHED IN </p><p>THE "HERALD." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN THE WAKE OF THE MASIYIWA INCIDENT, MUNGOSHI </p><p>SAYS THAT HE BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO FINDING STORIES IN </p><p>THE NEWSPAPER THAT HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN OR </p><p>APPROVED.  MINISTER MOYO WENT DIRECTLY TO SUB-EDITORS </p><p>AND PRODUCTION STAFF TO HAVE STORIES PLACED IN THE </p><p>PAPER AFTER MUNGOSHI HAD APPROVED AN EDITION AND "PUT </p><p>IT TO BED."  MOYO\'S BYPASSING OF MUNGOSHI HAD </p><p>DISASTROUS RESULTS ON MORALE AT THE PAPER AND SEVERELY </p><p>UNDERMINED WHAT MUNGOSHI SAYS WAS HIS DETERMINATION TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6392 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01177  02 OF 02  301120Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  BBG-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------D9488F  301120Z /38 </p><p>R 301123Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8540 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001177 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S (KRAFT), AF/PD (COX, HOWARD, SANDERS) </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/30/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PROP, PHUM, KPAO, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  FIRED GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPER EDITOR DETAILS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01177  02 OF 02  301120Z </p><p>STATE\'S PROPAGANDA EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p>MAKE THE "HERALD" A PAPER "FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) TO HIS SURPRISE, MUNGOSHI WAS SELECTED BY MOYO </p><p>TO BE ONE OF THREE JOURNALISTS TO INTERVIEW PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE ON THE OCCASION OF THE PRESIDENT\'S BIRTHDAY. </p><p>THIS IS REGARDED AS AN HONOR RESERVED ONLY FOR THE </p><p>MOST TRUSTED AND LOYAL JOURNALISTS.  MUNGOSHI TOOK </p><p>THIS AS A SIGNAL THAT MOYO HAD DECIDED TO CHANGE TACK </p><p>AND ALLOW THE "HERALD" GREATER INDEPENDENCE.  THREE </p><p>WEEKS AFTER THE INTERVIEW, HOWEVER, MOYO DEMANDED </p><p>MUNGOSHI\'S RESIGNATION.  MUNGOSHI REFUSED TO RESIGN </p><p>AND MOYO PROMPTLY FIRED HIM.  MUNGOSHI AND "SUNDAY </p><p>MAIL" (ALSO GOVERNMENT-OWNED) EDITOR FUNNY MUSHAVA </p><p>WERE FIRED ON THE SAME DAY, 10 DAYS AFTER MOYO SACKED </p><p>ZIMPAPERS MANAGING DIRECTOR SITHOLE.  MINISTER MOYO </p><p>REPLACED BOTH EDITORS WITH MEN KNOWN TO BE SYMPATHETIC </p><p>TO THE MINISTER\'S DESIRE TO USE THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED </p><p>MEDIA AS A BLATANT PROPAGANDA INSTRUMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: MUNGOSHI\'S ACCOUNT OF HIS EDITORSHIP </p><p>IS SOMEWHAT SELF-SERVING.  HE PORTRAYS HIMSELF AS A </p><p>BRAVE DEFENDER OF MEDIA INDEPENDENCE, BUT THE </p><p>"HERALD\'S" RECORD OF THE LAST 7 MONTHS DOES NOT OFFER </p><p>MUCH EVIDENCE OF INDEPENDENT REPORTING.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>MUNGOSHI\'S ACCOUNTS OF MINISTER MOYO\'S HARASSMENT AND </p><p>EVENTUAL DE FACTO EDITORSHIP OF THE PAPER RING TRUE. </p><p>MUNGOSHI\'S ACCOUNT CONFIRMS THE ARROGANCE AND </p><p>DESTRUCTIVE DETERMINATION OF INFORMATION MINISTER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01177  02 OF 02  301120Z </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO TO USE THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED MEDIA IN ANY </p><p>WAY HE CHOOSES TO PROMOTE PRO-GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA </p><p>AND LIES.  MUNGOSHI\'S EXPERIENCE ALSO CONFIRMS THE </p><p>ENORMOUS POWER AND LATITUDE FOR ACTION INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER MOYO CURRENTLY HAS IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: MUNGOSHI IS REALISTIC WHEN </p><p>IT COMES TO HIS OWN FUTURE IN ZIMBABWE: "I\'M FINISHED </p><p>AS A JOURNALIST IN THE COUNTRY," HE SAYS.  "WHO WOULD </p><p>HAVE ME NOW?"  HE HAS TURNED DOWN REQUESTS FROM THE </p><p>BBC AND SABC FOR INTERVIEWS ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE AT </p><p>THE "HERALD," PROBABLY WISE SINCE HE HAS A LAWYER </p><p>WORKING FULL TIME TO "ASSESS THE QUANTUM OF THE </p><p>DAMAGES" RELATED TO HIS FIRING.  MUNGOSHI SAYS HE </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO UNIVERSITY, GET A GRADUATE </p><p>DEGREE IN JOURNALISM, AND PERHAPS BECOME A PROFESSOR </p><p>OF JOURNALISM AT A ZIMBABWEAN UNIVERSITY.  FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING, HE IS WORKING ON ENGINEERING THE LARGEST </p><p>POSSIBLE SEVERANCE DEAL FROM ZIMPAPERS, AND BASKING IN </p><p>THE PLEASURE OF PEACEFUL EARLY MORNINGS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
