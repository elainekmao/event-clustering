<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000482 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR L/LEI, S/CT </p><p>DOJ FOR DAAG BRUCE SWARTZ </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, ASEC, PGOV, KJUS, YM, TERFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: FM QIRBI ON THE ARREST OF SHEIKH MOAYED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. BERLIN 406 </p><p>     B. SANAA 127 </p><p>     C. BERLIN 131 </p><p>     D. SECSTATE 7011 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Edmund J. Hull, Ambassador for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  On Monday 3/10 DCM provided Foreign </p><p>Minister al-Qirbi with a redacted copy of the U.S. complaint </p><p>against Sheikh al-Moayed and a non-paper highlighting the </p><p>most compelling arguments.  Qirbi commented on "USG </p><p>misconceptions" regarding Moayed\'s involvement with Hamas and </p><p>his financial transactions with a mosque in New York.  Qirbi </p><p>also offered future ROYG assistance to clarify these and </p><p>future "areas of confusion" concerning this case.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DCM Misenheimer met with Foreign Minister Abu Bakr </p><p>al-Qirbi on March 10 and discussed the arrest of Sheikh </p><p>Mohammed Ali al-Moayed (other topics reported septels). </p><p>(Ambassador was traveling in Aden).  To facilitate ROYG </p><p>access to relevant public documents, DCM presented Qirbi with </p><p>a redacted copy of the United States District Court Eastern </p><p>District of New York\'s complaint in support of the U.S. </p><p>request for Moayed\'s extradition.  DCM cautioned that many </p><p>have been surprised by the strength of this indictment, </p><p>particularly the evidence of al-Qaida links, and noted that </p><p>the Germans may reach a decision on the extradition of </p><p>Mohammed Mohsen Yahya Zayed, Moayed\'s Assistant, later this </p><p>week, and on the extradition of Moayed himself at the end of </p><p>March. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Qirbi provided additional information on two issues </p><p>ROYG considers fundamental to the U.S. case against Sheikh </p><p>Moayed:  Moayed\'s receipt of funds from a mosque in New York </p><p>and his involvement with Hamas.  Qirbi noted that the funds </p><p>Moayed received from the mosque in New York were intended to </p><p>assist him in his charity work in Yemen.  Qirbi then </p><p>explained that in Yemen contributions to individuals and </p><p>organizations supporting the people of Palestine, including </p><p>Hamas, are not illegal, and Moayed should therefore be judged </p><p>based on Yemeni, not U.S., law.  Qirbi also said that </p><p>numerous officials, perhaps including Moayed, met with Hamas </p><p>Undersecretary Khalid Mashal during his last trip to Yemen. </p><p>Any such meeting was not evidence of a terrorist connection, </p><p>argued Qirbi -- particularly since Yemeni meetings with </p><p>Mashal were focused on convincing him to support the Middle </p><p>East peace process.  Qirbi reiterated that ROYG and USG </p><p>should work together to look at these issues in more detail, </p><p>and volunteered the assistance of the Political Security </p><p>Organization in this endeavor. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  DCM acknowledged U.S. and Yemen disagreement on the </p><p>designation of certain terrorist organizations, but, in light </p><p>of the mutual designation of al-Qaeda as an illegal terrorist </p><p>group, suggested that any future U.S.-Yemen cooperation on </p><p>this case might focus on evidence of Moayed\'s dealings with </p><p>al-Qaeda.  Qirbi nodded affirmatively but did not pursue the </p><p>point. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment:  Since DOJ\'s March 5 press conference </p><p>announcing the release of the complaint, media coverage of </p><p>al-Moayed\'s arrest and public opposition have reappeared </p><p>after a hiatus of several weeks.  The March 8 Yemeni Observer </p><p>quoted a Yemeni official attesting to Moayed\'s innocence </p><p>saying, "It is illogical that a Yemeni with $20 million would </p><p>hand it over to Osama bin Laden."  This official has been </p><p>identified by a reliable embassy source as Mohammed Sudam, </p><p>President Saleh\'s interpreter and a BBC correspondent, and </p><p>his comment is thus likely to reflect President Saleh\'s </p><p>personal opinion.  Al-Sahwa Net, a publication of the </p><p>Islamist opposition party Islah, also reported that on </p><p>Sunday, March 9 more than a thousand men from the Khawlan </p><p>tribe participated in a sit-in in front of the Presidential </p><p>Palace demanding President Saleh\'s intervention to seek the </p><p>release of al-Moayed. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
