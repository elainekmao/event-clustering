(U)  CLASSIFIED BY ACTING POLCOUNS MARC SIEVERS, </p><p>EMBASSY ANKARA, REASON 1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DURING AN OFFICE CALL BY A/POLCOUNS AND </p><p>POLOFF ON JANUARY 7, TURKISH MFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL FOR SLAVIC REPUBLICS ALP KARAOSMANOGLU </p><p>SUMMARIZED AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON NATO ENLARGEMENT </p><p>BETWEEN FOREIGN MINISTERS YEVGENIY PRIMAKOV AND TANSU </p><p>CILLER DURING THE LATTER\'S VISIT TO MOSCOW DECEMBER </p><p>17-19, 1996.  KARAOSMANOGLU\'S SUMMARY EXPANDS ON THAT </p><p>PROVIDED THE AMBASSADOR BY MFA UNDERSECRETARY ONUR </p><p>OYMEN ON DECEMBER 20 (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ACCORDING TO KARAOSMANOGLU, PRIMAKOV TOLD </p><p>CILLER THAT RUSSIA DOES NOT VIEW CURRENT PLANS FOR </p><p>NATO EXPANSION AS A THREAT TO RUSSIA.  HOWEVER, RUSSIA </p><p>WANTS TO ENSURE THAT AN EXPANDED NATO DOES NOT BECOME </p><p>"A NEW NAME FOR AN OLD GEO-POLITICAL DIVISION" THAT </p><p>ISOLATES RUSSIA FROM THE REST OF EUROPE.  RUSSIA </p><p>RECOGNIZES THE HISTORIC IMPORTANCE OF NATO ENLARGEMENT </p><p>AND ITS OWN EVOLVING RELATIONS WITH NATO AND </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY WANTS TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY IN ORDER TO </p><p>AVOID "MAKING A GEO-STRATEGIC MISTAKE." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  KARAOSMANOGLU SAID PRIMAKOV CONFIDED TO </p><p>CILLER THAT "CERTAIN CIRCLES IN RUSSIA," WHO WERE </p><p>INTERESTED PRIMARILY IN MODERNIZING THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>ARMED FORCES, DID NOT FAVOR IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ANKARA  00231  081035Z </p><p>NATO.  KARAOSMANOGLU SURMISED THAT PRIMAKOV INTENDED </p><p>THE TURKS TO ASSUME THESE "CIRCLES" WERE LOCATED </p><p>WITHIN THE RUSSIAN DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT AND FOUND IN </p><p>THE SPECTER OF AN ANTAGONISTIC NATO CONVENIENT </p><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR CLAIMING RESOURCES NEEDED TO UPGRADE </p><p>RUSSIA\'S MILITARY CAPABILITIES.  PRIMAKOV THEN MADE A </p><p>POINT OF ASSURING CILLER THAT, DESPITE THIS ELEMENT OF </p><p>OPPOSITION,  RUSSIAN POLICY MAKERS WERE "READY TO TALK </p><p>ABOUT RELATIONS WITH NATO," UNDERSTOOD THE CONCEPT OF </p><p>NATO EXPANSION, AND SUPPORTED A CLOSER/IMPROVED </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ALLIANCE.  PRIMAKOV WARNED </p><p>CILLER, HOWEVER, THAT AS NATO EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MORE </p><p>MEMBERS, THE ALLIANCE INEVITABLY WOULD ENCOMPASS MORE </p><p>DISPUTES AND GROW LESS COHESIVE.  NOW NATO SUFFERS </p><p>FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TURKEY AND GREECE, PRIMAKOV </p><p>ELABORATED, BUT WITH MORE MEMBERS IT WOULD INCLUDE </p><p>MORE DISPUTES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  KARAOSMANOGLU REPORTED THAT CILLER RESPONDED </p><p>TO PRIMAKOV\'S STATEMENT OF RUSSIA\'S POSITIONS BY </p><p>CANDIDLY DESCRIBING TURKEY\'S VIEWS.  FOR TURKEY, NATO </p><p>ENLARGEMENT COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION FROM </p><p>EXPANSION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), THE WESTERN </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION (WEU) AND THE LATTER\'S EVOLVING </p><p>COLLECTIVE SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES.  TURKEY AGREED </p><p>THAT AN ENLARGED NATO SHOULD NOT ESTABLISH NEW LINES </p><p>OF DIVISION IN EUROPE.  TURKEY\'S VIEW WAS THAT ALL </p><p>THINKING ABOUT EUROPE MUST INCLUDE RUSSIA AS AN </p><p>INTEGRAL AND IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE WHOLE. </p><p> </p><p>GROSSMAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ANKARA  00231  081035Z </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
