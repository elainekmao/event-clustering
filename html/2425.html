<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000254 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR PM:JSHAUNFIELD, AF/RA:MBITTRICK, JWALSER, </p><p>AND L </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, KOMC, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SMALL ARMS/LIGHT WEAPONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 01 ABUJA 1244 </p><p>     B. 01 ABUJA 1249 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request; Please see para 11. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) SUMMARY: During a January 3 conversation with </p><p>PolMilOff, the Chairman of the Nigerian Committee on the </p><p>ECOWAS Moratorium on Small Arms/Light Weapons (SA/LW) Musa </p><p>Yahaya said Nigeria was making progress combating SA/LW </p><p>proliferation, but much more needed to be done.  He explained </p><p>a three-phase approach to informing government agencies and </p><p>the public about SA/LW, and outlined his committee\'s plans </p><p>for 2002, including additional destruction efforts and a </p><p>train-the-trainer program for agencies that manage borders. </p><p>Confirming that most illicit weapons enter Nigeria from </p><p>neighboring states, Yahaya asked that the USG (and other </p><p>supplier states) assist by having arms exporters comply with </p><p>the ECOWAS Moratorium, which requires a waiver from ECOWAS </p><p>before allowing export of SA/LW to Nigeria (and other ECOWAS </p><p>member-states).  Yahaya also requested technical assistance </p><p>to develop an arms database for Nigeria.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) During a January 3 call by PolMilOff, Chairman of the </p><p>Nigerian National Committee on the ECOWAS Moratorium on Small </p><p>Arms/Light Weapons Musa Yahaya confirmed that Nigeria had </p><p>destroyed arms at the Defense Industries Corporation of </p><p>Nigeria (DICON) facility and dumped ammunition off the </p><p>continental shelf during July 2001.  He stated that another </p><p>round of destruction would be underway soon, now that a </p><p>quantity of illicit arms sufficient for a destruction effort </p><p>had been collected by border agencies and the police. </p><p>Turning to ECOWAS efforts, Yahaya stated that eight of 15 </p><p>ECOWAS members had fully implemented the moratorium, and that </p><p>the other seven needed only to update their national </p><p>legislation.  (COMMENT: Yahaya may have been painting too </p><p>rosy a picture of most member-state actions.  However, recent </p><p>actions he noted, such as Senegal\'s and The Gambia\'s </p><p>formation of national committees, in November and December </p><p>respectively, are noteworthy.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Yahaya focused most of his remarks on the committee\'s </p><p>efforts on training and public education on the SA/LW issue. </p><p>(NOTE: Nigeria\'s national committee is seated within the </p><p>Ministry of Cooperation and Integration in Africa.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  He hoped to have three phases of training: the first </p><p>for military, security and border services; the second for </p><p>civil society, focusing on youth; and the third for the </p><p>country\'s opinion leaders, both political and traditional. </p><p>The first phase of training in Abuja in December was </p><p>postponed for lack of funds.  Yahaya recalled the ECOWAS </p><p>SA/LW train-the-trainer event in November 2001 in Dakar </p><p>(supported by Canada), and said the first Nigerian training </p><p>phase would follow its format.  By targeting the military, </p><p>security services and border agencies (such as immigration </p><p>and customs), Phase I was intended to increase Nigeria\'s </p><p>ability to prevent illicit SA/LW crossing porous borders. </p><p>(NOTE: Nigeria\'s SA/LW problems stem from illicit arms </p><p>smuggled from neighboring states, primarily Chad and </p><p>Cameroon, but also Benin.  END NOTE.)  Phase I training would </p><p>focus on: How to identify illicit arms shipments; </p><p>disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes; the </p><p>legal aspect of the ECOWAS moratorium, particularly as they </p><p>relate to national laws; human rights law; the rights of </p><p>refugees; the scope of proliferation; cooperation between </p><p>armed forces and security agencies to reduce SA/LW </p><p>proliferation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) What Nigeria most needed from supplier states, Yahaya </p><p>stated, was support in managing the legal flow of arms and </p><p>ammunition into ECOWAS countries.  To import a quantity of </p><p>arms and ammunition to Nigeria, a dealer (who must be </p><p>licensed by the Presidency) sends a quantity and type </p><p>specific application to the Nigerian ECOWAS Moratorium </p><p>Committee, which seeks an ECOWAS waiver on the dealer\'s </p><p>behalf.  ECOWAS sends the waiver application to </p><p>member-states.  If there are no objections or comments after </p><p>one month the waiver is approved (Ref A).  The dealer can </p><p>then import and sell the arms and ammunition, but must inform </p><p>the committee of the identity of all buyers and specific </p><p>information about the weapons purchased, such as serial </p><p>numbers and quantity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Yahaya explained that a database of weapons and </p><p>ammunition could enable the committee to play a positive role </p><p>in identifying weapons used in crime or other acts that </p><p>threaten security (a prime area of concern for Nigeria). </p><p>Speaking frankly, Yahaya admitted that no Nigerians had </p><p>applied for arms importation waivers yet, but the committee </p><p>had "a good idea" of who was importing arms, and planned to </p><p>work with the police and other security agencies in 2002 to </p><p>enforce the program.  Dealers who did not follow the rules </p><p>would, at a minimum, lose their licenses.  Meanwhile, </p><p>supplier states, such as the U.S., could help Nigeria by </p><p>confirming that importers had proper ECOWAS waivers before </p><p>allowing weapons shipments to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Yahaya also requested technical assistance from donor </p><p>countries.  Not only did the committee hope to create a </p><p>computer database of arms (containing the information on </p><p>legal imports described above), it wanted to establish zonal, </p><p>state, and eventually, local government area offices.  While </p><p>he noted a need for financial assistance to hold seminars </p><p>such as Phase I of the train-the-trainer program, he also </p><p>requested technical assistance for training and computers to </p><p>establish the arms database and to equip zonal offices. </p><p>Finally, Yahaya mentioned vehicles, explaining that when an </p><p>illicit shipment is intercepted, his committee finds it </p><p>difficult to get from Abuja to the border crossing where the </p><p>shipment was captured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The impact of small arms on security in Nigeria should </p><p>not be underestimated (as the assassination of Minister of </p><p>Justice Bola Ige and recent inter-communal clashes confirm). </p><p>However, Nigeria has a very limited arms production capacity, </p><p>and, improvised single-shot long guns aside, what Nigeria </p><p>does produce is very expensive.  Illicit arms enter Nigeria </p><p>primarily across porous borders from neighboring states, and </p><p>through illicit sea shipments through the ports.  Ideally, </p><p>the police, immigration and customs service could carry out </p><p>the moratorium committee\'s work at the borders, obviating the </p><p>need for committee travel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Nigeria has made strides in meeting the "national </p><p>level" steps identified by the UN Conference on the Illicit </p><p>Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons of July 2001.  These </p><p>accomplishments were already in the queue as a result of </p><p>previous ECOWAS efforts.  For the ECOWAS moratorium to be </p><p>successful, weapon supplier states should seek to comply with </p><p>the ECOWAS approval process by confirming a waiver has been </p><p>received from ECOWAS before allowing the export of arms </p><p>shipments into the sub-region.  While this will not stop the </p><p>illicit trade, it will give member-states knowledge of </p><p>weapons entering their territory and give them the ability to </p><p>track these weapons when used for criminal purposes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) To help reduce the number of illicit arms entering </p><p>Nigeria, the USG could consider a two-prong approach.  First, </p><p>to reduce the number of illicit weapons circulating in the </p><p>sub-region, we should consider assistance to ECOWAS </p><p>member-states (plus perhaps Chad and Cameroon) for arms </p><p>destruction, focusing first on states unable to fund </p><p>destruction on their own.  The second task would be to </p><p>provide direct assistance to national ECOWAS Moratorium </p><p>Committees for train-the-trainer programs that enhance the </p><p>ability of enforcement agencies to carry out interdiction </p><p>(the military, police, State Security Service, immigration </p><p>and customs).  This training assistance could be provided </p><p>bilaterally through national ECOWAS moratorium committees, or </p><p>for multiple states\' border and security agencies through </p><p>ECOWAS.  Helping to prevent illicit weapons and ammunition </p><p>from entering Nigeria, while also reducing the number of </p><p>illicit arms in the region-as-a-whole could begin to reduce </p><p>the availability of SA/LW in Nigeria, which in the long-term </p><p>should have a positive impact on security conditions here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) ACTION REQUEST: We request that the Department </p><p>provide guidance on our policy regarding adherence to the </p><p>ECOWAS waiver mechanism prior to allowing arms exports from </p><p>the U.S. into the West African sub-region.  Additionally, </p><p>Department may want to consider establishing a new procedure </p><p>to promote better cooperation with the ECOWAS mechanism.  One </p><p>possible method would be to cable the information on an </p><p>export request to the Embassy in the importing state, which </p><p>might then confirm that a waiver has been granted through the </p><p>state\'s national committee.  Embassy Abuja could also confirm </p><p>the waiver with the ECOWAS Secretariat, if a national </p><p>committee is not yet active.  END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
