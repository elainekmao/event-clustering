<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001443 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, NP, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL POLICE SHUT DOWN PRESS CONFERENCE PROTESTING </p><p>DORJE SHUGDEN STATEMENTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5, (b),(d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Police in Kathmandu interrupted a press </p><p>conference held by a local Buddhist group on July 25 to </p><p>answer allegations made during a July 19 press conference by </p><p>followers of the controversial Dorje Shugden deity.  Shugden </p><p>worshippers had accused Dharamsala of violating their freedom </p><p>of religion and engaging in "anti-China" activities from </p><p>Nepali soil.  Police detained two organizers of the July 25 </p><p>event in front of a crowd of about two dozen local </p><p>journalists.  The local Buddhist group and the Dalai Lama\'s </p><p>personal representative in Nepal both issued statements </p><p>rebutting the Shugden followers\' claims.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Police Shut Down Counter-Press Conference </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Police closed down a press conference held by a </p><p>local Buddhist community group July 25 to protest statements </p><p>by followers of the Dorje Shugden deity that impugned the </p><p>Dalai Lama and Tibetan refugees in Nepal.  Members of the </p><p>Dorje Shugden sect had held their own press conference in </p><p>Kathmandu July 19 to denounce the Dalai Lama\'s six-year-old </p><p>ban on the worship of the deity Dorje Shugden.  Sect members </p><p>also alleged that the Dalai Lama\'s administration had used </p><p>Nepal for "anti-China" activities" for more than forty years. </p><p> In particular, they singled out Mustang district, in </p><p>north-central Nepal along the Tibet border, as the site of </p><p>such activities. </p><p> </p><p>Two Organizers Detained </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The July 25 press conference, organized by the </p><p>"Srongtsen Bhrikuti Social and Cultural Upliftment </p><p>Association" at a hotel in the capital, ended abruptly after </p><p>a handful of policemen entered the hall and ordered the </p><p>proceedings to stop.  The Dalai Lama\'s personal </p><p>representative in Nepal was reading a statement at the time. </p><p>According to a witness, the police asked who had organized </p><p>the event and whether the sponsoring organization was duly </p><p>registered.  They then took two of the organizers, Nepali </p><p>nationals named Pasang Sherpa and Wangchuk Norbu, away to </p><p>police headquarters.  Twenty-five journalists witnessed the </p><p>episode, including representatives of Nepal\'s major private </p><p>media outlets. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Tibetans were bitter that their press briefing was </p><p>closed down while the Dorje Shugden press conference had not </p><p>been.  One alleged that the Dorje Shugden organization </p><p>receives funding and support from the Chinese Embassy in </p><p>Kathmandu, and that the July 25 press briefing had been shut </p><p>down at the Chinese Embassy\'s urging. </p><p> </p><p>Community Press Statement Proclaims Loyalty to Nepal </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Previously, local Tibetans had responded to the July </p><p>19 remarks made by a Dorje Shugden leader, the 13th Kundeling </p><p>Tagtsha Jetung, by releasing a statement to the media on July </p><p>21.  The local Tibetans\' statement said that Dorje Shugden </p><p>followers were attempting "to disgrace the Buddhist religion </p><p>and to disrupt the community."  It continued, "we believe </p><p>that Tibetans in Nepal have always been loyal to the foreign </p><p>policy of the nation and thus have not carried out any </p><p>anti-China activities as reported."  Community members met </p><p>earlier in the day to decide on a response and had enlisted </p><p>an ethnic-Tibetan reporter from a leading English-language </p><p>daily to draft it. </p><p> </p><p>Sectarians Creating "Mistrust and Misunderstanding" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) A statement released by the Srongtsen Bhrikuti </p><p>Association at the July 25 press briefing continued in the </p><p>same vein.  It asserted that the Dorje Shugden followers were </p><p>trying to foment "mistrust and misunderstanding" between the </p><p>Tibet refugees and the government of Nepal.  The statement </p><p>also defended the Dalai Lama, quoting at length from his </p><p>Nobel Peace Prize citation, and expressed gratitude to </p><p>Nepal\'s King, his government and the people of Nepal for </p><p>harboring Tibetans. </p><p>Dharamsala\'s Statement </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Another statement released at the aborted July 25 </p><p>briefing, prepared by the Dalai Lama\'s representative in </p><p>consultation with Dharamsala, labeled the Dorje Shugden </p><p>group\'s statement "preposterous" and attempted to refute its </p><p>points one by one.  This statement reviewed the history of </p><p>the Dorje Shugden controversy, including the February 4, 1997 </p><p>murder in India of Tibetan religious leader Geshe Lobsang </p><p>Gyatso, an outspoken critic of Shugden worship. </p><p>Background on Srongsten Bhrikuti </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>8. (U) Membership in the Srongsten Bhrikuti Association </p><p>consists almost exclusively of Buddhists native to Nepal, </p><p>mostly ethnic Sherpas, Gurungs and others who live in the </p><p>high mountains adjacent to Tibet.  The association runs a </p><p>clinic in the Boudha area of Kathmandu and provides free </p><p>medicine and ambulance services to the needy.  They also </p><p>collect blood donations in cooperation with the Nepal Red </p><p>Cross.  (Note:  The association was named for the </p><p>eighth-century King of Tibet, Srongsten Gampo, and his Nepali </p><p>wife, Bhrikuti.  End Note.) </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
