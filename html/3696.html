<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 001167 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAO, BM, ASSK, Ethnics, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: PATRIOT DAY IN RANGOON </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Some 325 invited guests, including high-ranking GOB </p><p>military and civilian officials, Aung San Suu Kyi and the </p><p>senior NLD leadership, Muslim representatives, ethnic </p><p>leaders, and about 100 resident American citizens gathered </p><p>September 11 in downtown Rangoon to observe Patriot Day. </p><p>COM Martinez presented a short address and read President </p><p>Bush\'s Patriot Day announcement.  The MSG detachment posted </p><p>the colors, a Kachin choir sang U.S. patriotic songs, and </p><p>the gathering observed a minute of silence to honor the </p><p>victims and heroes of the terrorist attacks. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Following the 30-minute ceremony, invitees </p><p>repaired to a reception hosted by DAO.  Aung San Suu Kyi\'s </p><p>rare public appearance created a stir, particularly as the </p><p>event also brought together senior military officers, ethnic </p><p>leaders, religious clerics (including the spokesman of </p><p>Burma\'s Shi\'a community), the diplomatic corps, and business </p><p>leaders.  GOB authorities worked closely with the hotel and </p><p>RSO to provide excellent and unobtrusive security for the </p><p>event.  Media coverage was good, and many resident Amcits </p><p>voiced appreciation for being included.  COM drew on very </p><p>helpful media talking points provided by PA for her remarks. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) This event, a successful, dignified commemoration </p><p>of Patriot Day, also provided a much-needed venue to bring </p><p>together Burmese of various political and ethnic persuasions </p><p>who rarely have the opportunity to meet face-to-face.  ASSK </p><p>told the COM that it was "wonderful" to meet with young </p><p>attendees (e.g., the members of the Kachin choir) and also </p><p>with many ambassadors who she said "rarely come close to </p><p>me."  At one point several senior ethnic leader and Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi were conversing in a corner--we quickly scanned the </p><p>room for the senior GOB representative (instant tripartite </p><p>dialogue?) but he had unfortunately just departed.  Given </p><p>the many compliments we received from numbers ambassadors </p><p>and from ASSK on the excellent contact opportunities the </p><p>event provided, post plans more such large public diplomacy </p><p>events in the future. </p><p></p></div>
