Palmieri; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Yet another Honduran political figure was </p><p>implicated in drug trafficking when he was arrested on July 6 </p><p>fleeing the scene of an airplane crash in the eastern </p><p>department of Olancho.  National Party Deputy, Armando Avila </p><p>Panchame, was arrested by the police for drug trafficking and </p><p>attempted murder (for running his car through two police </p><p>roadblocks.)  President Ricardo Maduro, President of the </p><p>National Congress Pepe Lobo, and Attorney General Roy Medina </p><p>-- all indicated congressional immunity would be lifted to </p><p>pursue the prosecution of this deputy.  This arrest could </p><p>prove to be a key test of the political and judicial </p><p>systems, ability to attack the growing narcocorruption </p><p>problem in Honduras.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On Saturday, July 5, Honduran police authorities, </p><p>responding to intelligence information, mounted an operation </p><p>against a suspected drug trafficking airplane that crashed in </p><p>the eastern Honduran department of Olancho.  The operation </p><p>resulted in the arrest of nine individuals, including a </p><p>member of the Honduran National Congress, Armando Avila </p><p>Panchame, a Colombian, and a Venezuelan.  Unfortunately, </p><p>there were no drugs seized or found; however police are still </p><p>conducting a series of searches of the surrounding areas. </p><p>Canine units, funded by a State International Narcotics and </p><p>Law Enforcement (INL) program, did alert to the rpesence of </p><p>drugs in the aircraft and vehicles.  The bold narco aircraft </p><p>landing took place on a secondary paved roadway that was </p><p>blocked by drug traffickers, vehicles, which had been </p><p>modified to illuminate the makeshift runway with floodlights. </p><p> Trees along the roadway had also been removed with </p><p>chainsaws.  Police recovered automatic AK-47 and M-16 rifles, </p><p>200 rounds of ammunition, satellite phones, radio equipment, </p><p>and night reflector vests at the location.  It appears that </p><p>the aircraft successfully unloaded its cargo, but in its </p><p>haste to depart as police descended on the scene it struck </p><p>one of the vehicles that had secured one end of the </p><p>improvised runway. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) There is some media speculation, based on public </p><p>statements made by the son of the notorious (and currently </p><p>incarcerated in the U.S.) drug trafficker Ramon Matta, that </p><p>there was a confrontation between rival drug cartels.  The </p><p>location of the drug delivery abutted a ranch owned by the </p><p>Matta family.  Matta is claiming to have aided police by </p><p>informaing them of the landing of the suspect aircraft and </p><p>ythen shooting at it as it tried to depart.  He also said he </p><p>permitted searches of his property for the missing drugs. </p><p>(Comment: Police report no such cooperation and have said </p><p>that the shots fired from the Matta group were a signal to </p><p>the aircraft,s pilot that police were approaching.  There </p><p>were bullet holes observed in the aircraft.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) While no drugs were seized, Honduran Deputy Avila </p><p>Panchame is charged with attempted murder for having run his </p><p>vehicle through two police roadblocks. The statements of two </p><p>police officers at those roadblocks accuse Avila Panchame of </p><p>refusing to stop and charging through the roadblocks.  He is </p><p>also being charged with drug trafficking.  The arrest of a </p><p>member of Congress is keeping the spotlight on the extent to </p><p>which narcocorruption is permeating Honduran institutions. </p><p>President Maduro, President of the National Congress Pepe </p><p>Lobo, and the Attorney General have all indicated </p><p>congressional immunity will be waived in this case to pursue </p><p>the prosecution of this deputy on the drug charges.  Under </p><p>the Honduran Constitution, immunity for attempted murder or </p><p>murder are exempt from any congressional immunity claim </p><p>(Comment:  This incident is not the first time that Avila </p><p>Panchame has come to the Embassy,s attention for possible </p><p>involvement in drug trafficking.  Earlier in April of this </p><p>year, the same vehicle in which he was traveling during this </p><p>incident was observed by witnesses at the scene of an earlier </p><p>suspected crashed aircraft.  In that incident police seized </p><p>397 kilos of cocaine, but no arrests were ever made.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  This arrest could prove to be a key test of </p><p>the political and judicial systems, ability to attack the </p><p>growing narco-corruption problem in Honduras.  Avila Panchame </p><p>is now the third Honduran political figure to be arrested on </p><p>drug trafficking charges in the last year.  Coming on the </p><p>heels of the June 20 arrest of Liberal Party Central American </p><p>Parliament member Cesar Diaz in Nicaragua (reftel) and last </p><p>summer,s arrest of a former deputy in Panama (both of whom </p><p>were arrested in possession of heroin) the media is </p><p>highlighting the mounting connections between international </p><p>drug traffickers and Honduran political elites.  As reported </p><p>septel, the Ambassador recently placed the Attorney General </p><p>on notice that his office must produce some high-profile </p><p>drug-trafficking and corruption prosecutions immediately or </p><p>risk losing further U.S. support.  We will be monitoring </p><p>developments in this case closely.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
