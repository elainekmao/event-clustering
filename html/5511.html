On January 28, 2003, Commercial Officer Mary O\'Brien met </p><p>with Srinivasan Kartikeya and Adeeb Yawar of Intergulf, </p><p>Ltd., Sharjah, UAE, regarding the shipment of a single </p><p>spindle gun drill.  Intergulf had previously reported to </p><p>Comoff O\'Brien that this shipment had been stopped in the </p><p>U.S. at the request of U.S. authorities, i.e., the Office of </p><p>Export Enforcement (OEE). </p><p> </p><p>2.  Intergulf\'s premises are located on the premises of Port </p><p>Khalid in Sharjah.  A Gate Pass authorized by Intergulf (and </p><p>5 AED, or 1.35 USD) was required for Comoff to enter the </p><p>port.   Intergulf is a subsidiary of IFFCO, a UAE company </p><p>established in 1975 and heavily involved in food processing </p><p>and packaging, personal care and cleaning products, </p><p>industrial products and logistical services.  Intergulf </p><p>occupies two large buildings on the port.  Intergulf itself </p><p>has three divisions, two for the production of PET plastic </p><p>containers and PVC for industrial use and a third for </p><p>logistics and shipping. </p><p> </p><p>3.  At the port and in a very clean and modern facility, </p><p>Intergulf/Empol manufactures plastic forms for liquid </p><p>containers.  These forms resemble large test tubes and are </p><p>later blown out to form plastic water bottles, soft drink </p><p>bottles and bottles for vegetable oils.  During this </p><p>process, molten plastic is molded around hollow metal tubes </p><p>that are filled with chilled water to speed the cooling and </p><p>forming process.  One line has tubes that are about the size </p><p>and shape of a hair curling iron.  The molding machines are </p><p>initially supplied with molds, but in the course of the </p><p>manufacturing process, they may break or become damaged.  If </p><p>this occurs, Mr. Yawar said Intergulf/Empol has a machining </p><p>shop where they can make new molds or repair damaged ones. </p><p>Comoff viewed the machine shop where molds are made from </p><p>solid steel rods, using CNC machine tools (2- and 3-axis). </p><p>The molds must be hollowed out to accommodate the water for </p><p>cooling.  Mr. Yawar explained that this is why the gun drill </p><p>is required, specifically to hollow out rods that are </p><p>approximately 1 to 1 1/2" in diameter.  During the visit to </p><p>the machine shop Comoff saw other molds that had been </p><p>hollowed out and Mr. Kartikeya said the machines they </p><p>currently use are not suitable for the smaller molds. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Comoff O\'Brien explained to Mssrs. Yawar and Kartikeya </p><p>that an export license was required and since none of the </p><p>U.S. parties were willing to apply for the license, </p><p>Intergulf\'s only other recourse would be to retain a party </p><p>in the U.S. to apply for the license on behalf of Intergulf. </p><p>They explained that the seller had agreed to refund the </p><p>money to Intergulf and they might have to agree to that if </p><p>they could find no one who would apply for the license for </p><p>them.  Comoff O\'Brien also explained that in the event of </p><p>future such purchases, Intergulf might want to clarify with </p><p>their supplier who would have the responsibility for getting </p><p>any needed export license before payment is made.  Mssrs. </p><p>Yawar and Kartikeya agreed to the conduct of a post-shipment </p><p>verification if the export of this or any similar machine is </p><p>authorized by an export license. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Comment:  While Intergulf/Empol is a legitimate company </p><p>with a legitimate, if perhaps occasional, need for metal </p><p>drilling and boring machinery, Comoff has no way of knowing </p><p>whether the machine in question would be appropriate for </p><p>such an end use.  In addition, Intergulf\'s logistics and </p><p>shipping activities at its portside location could make it </p><p>easy for such an item to be shipped from the UAE to another </p><p>destination. </p><p> </p><p>6.  On February 3, Comoff O\'Brien received a telephone call </p><p>from Carolyn Stern of Direct Container Line (DCL).  DCL was </p><p>the non-vessel owner common carrier originally contracted to </p><p>ship the machine.  Ms. Stern said she had received an email </p><p>from her agent in the UAE stating the US Embassy had </p><p>approved this export using `DCL\'s export license\'.  Comoff </p><p>emphasized that no such approval had been given and </p><p>reiterated that only the Office of Export Enforcement could </p><p>release the shipment.  Ms. Stern stated the machine is not </p><p>in her custody and is still at the premises of the exporter </p><p>in Cincinnati. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Please advise if BIS/OEE requires any additional </p><p>information regarding Intergulf. </p><p> </p><p>WILLIAMS </p><p></p></div>
