<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000562 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEYNS </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "End of the road for U.N. system" the </p><p>      pro-government daily "The Daily Mirror" used its March 19 </p><p>      editorial to accuse the United States and Britain of </p><p>      usurping United Nations authority over the Iraq crisis. </p><p>      ".the U.N. system will never be the same again after the </p><p>      U.S.A. and Britain openly disregarded not only the majority </p><p>      of the U.N. Security Council members, but the voices of all </p><p>      those people who demonstrated against war in their millions </p><p>      all over the world," the editorial said.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The past one month has clearly shown the world </p><p>      how the power of the U.N. has been eroded. . .  It </p><p>      is sad that, after so much hard work of inspections </p><p>      and weapons destruction, the U.N. weapons inspectors </p><p>      led by Hans Blix were not given a chance to complete </p><p>      their work.  There was so much hope that Blix and </p><p>      his team were going to accomplish the disarmament of </p><p>      Iraq without a single shot being fired.  Now, it </p><p>      appears as if the United States President was using </p><p>      the U.N. inspectors to point out whatever weapons </p><p>      Iraq possesses, and neutralize them to allow </p><p>      American forces to invade Iraq with minimum </p><p>      resistance.  It is now clear that the U.S. President </p><p>      was never really serious about U.N. diplomacy.  It </p><p>      is also ironic that in his war speech, Bush asks the </p><p>      U.N. to continue with its work and provide </p><p>      humanitarian assistance to Iraq.  True, some U.N. </p><p>      agencies will not stand by and leave Iraqis to die </p><p>      after the expected bombardment by American and </p><p>      British forces.  But the U.N. system will never be </p><p>      the same again after the U.S.A. and Britain openly </p><p>      disregarded not only the majority of the U.N. </p><p>      Security Council members, but the voices of all </p><p>      those people who demonstrated against war in their </p><p>      millions all over the world. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
