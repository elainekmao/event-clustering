<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000654 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, PREL, ES, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN REQUEST FOR BORDER MAPPING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SAN SALVADOR 324 </p><p> </p><p>     B. TEGUCIGALPA 533 </p><p>     C. SAN SALVADOR 629 </p><p>     D. CUMMINS-PFORZHEIMER DELIVERY OF CD-ROM </p><p> </p><p>1. Per refs A, B, C, and D Honduras and El Salvador are </p><p>looking to move forward on border demarcation via a </p><p>binational border commission but progress has been stymied </p><p>due to outdated maps.  Their joint request, received at both </p><p>Embassy Tegucigalpa and San Salvador, is for maps at scale of </p><p>1:25,000 (ref C). </p><p> </p><p>2. Ref D material has been reviewed by Raul Andino Torres, </p><p>President of the Honduran Special El Salvador-Honduras Border </p><p>Demarcation Commission and a number of technical engineers. </p><p>Mr. Andino Torres informed Poloff March 7 that the </p><p>information in ref D, while informative, was at too large a </p><p>scale to be useful for border demarcation purposes. </p><p> </p><p>3. Post notes that the border demarcation issue has received </p><p>broad press coverage in both El Salvador and Honduras.  The </p><p>process has been stalled for some time and tensions have been </p><p>mounting.  Post concurs with ref C and urges the State </p><p>Department to contact NIMA at the earliest possible moment in </p><p>order to request appropriate assistance. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
