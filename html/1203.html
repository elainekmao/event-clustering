(C) THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT HAS FINALLY FOCUSED ON </p><p>THE USG\'S CRITICAL WORDS AND ACTIONS IN THE LAST FEW </p><p>MONTHS AND HAS BEGUN SENDING SIGNALS OF ITS DISPLEASURE. </p><p>THESE INCLUDE NOT ACCREDITING THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC </p><p>INSTITUTE (NDI) AND THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN </p><p>INSTITUTE (IRI) AS ELECTION OBSERVERS, SENDING A </p><p>DIPLOMATIC NOTE AT THE LAST MINUTE STATING THAT IT WOULD </p><p>NOT RESPOND TO NATIONAL DAY MESSAGES, NOT SENDING A </p><p>SENIOR GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S 4TH </p><p>OF JULY RECEPTION AND GIVING THE RECEPTION NEGATIVE </p><p>COVERAGE ON THE TELEVISION NEWS.  FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>MUDENGE EXPRESSED DISPLEASURE WITH THE PROPOSED </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL ACTIONS TO PLACE "SANCTIONS" ON ZIMBABWE, </p><p>AND HOPED THE U.S. WILL NOT COME INTO THE SAME LEAGUE AS </p><p>THE UNITED KINGDOM. WE THINK PRESIDENT MUGABE IS LOOKING </p><p>FOR SOMEONE ON WHOM TO BLAME THE DEFEAT HIS PARTY WAS </p><p>HANDED IN THE JUST-CONCLUDED PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, AND </p><p>WILL TARGET THE U.S. FOR CRITICISM AS PART OF HIS POST- </p><p>ELECTION GOVERNANCE STRATEGY AND PRESIDENTIAL RE- </p><p>ELECTION CAMPAIGN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AN ACCUMULATION OF RECENT SIGNALS SUGGESTS THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE IS NOT HAPPY WITH THE USG. </p><p>ON JULY 3, THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SENT A </p><p>DIPLOMATIC NOTE, ALONG WITH THE STANDARD FOURTH OF JULY </p><p>GREETING FROM PRESIDENT MUGABE, STATING THAT IT "HAS THE </p><p>HONOR TO ADVISE THAT THE PRACTICE OF SPEECHES AT </p><p>NATIONAL DAY MESSAGES (SIC) HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED."  IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03634  01 OF 02  050953Z </p><p>RESPONSE, THE AMBASSADOR INFORMED DEPUTY FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER NICHOLAS GOCHE THAT HE PLANNED TO GIVE A SPEECH </p><p>ON JULY 4.  GOCHE REPLIED, "OF COURSE, AMBASSADORS ARE </p><p>EXPECTED TO SPEAK AT SUCH EVENTS."  (COMMENT: WE </p><p>INTERPRET THIS TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED AND ABRUPT CHANGE </p><p>IN PRACTICE AS A WAY TO ATTEMPT TO CENSOR FOREIGN </p><p>DIPLOMATS FROM SAYING ANYTHING REMOTELY CRITICAL OF THE </p><p>GOZ AND ITS POLICIES. END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) LATER THAT DAY, FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE </p><p>PROTESTED LEGISLATION WINDING ITS WAY THROUGH CONGRESS </p><p>THAT WOULD RESULT IN "SANCTIONS" AGAINST ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>THE RECENT HEARING BEFORE THE HOUSE AFRICA SUBCOMMITTEE. </p><p>IN PASSING MUDENGE IMPLIED ANTI-USG STATEMENTS MAY BE </p><p>FORTHCOMING AND REMARKED THAT HE HOPED THE UNITED STATES </p><p>WOULD NOT BE IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS BRITAIN. (COMMENT: </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED </p><p>IN A VERY ACRIMONIOUS AND PUBLIC DISPUTE THAT HAS </p><p>RESULTED IN PARALYSIS OF THEIR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. </p><p>END COMMENT).  THE SENIOR REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SCHEDULED TO APPEAR AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>FOURTH OF JULY RECEPTION, DEPUTY MINISTER GOCHE, WAS </p><p>CALLED AWAY THE MORNING OF JULY 4 TO DEAL WITH A GROUP </p><p>OF UNRULY WAR VETS IN BINDURA IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL, AN </p><p>AREA HE DOES NOT REPRESENT IN PARLIAMENT.  WE INTERPRET </p><p>THIS ABSENCE TO BE THE ZIMBABWEAN EQUIVALENT OF </p><p>"DIPLOMATIC FLU." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE NIGHTLY NEWSCAST ON THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>BROADCASTING CORPORATION (ZBC) NORMALLY REPORTS NATIONAL </p><p>DAY RECEPTIONS IN AN ANODYNE MANNER.  IN OUR CASE, THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03634  01 OF 02  050953Z </p><p>ZBC DESCRIBED THE EVENT NEGATIVELY AND NOTED AN ALLEGED </p><p>HEAVY PRESENCE OF THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE </p><p>(MDC) MEMBERS AT THE RECEPTION, WHICH IT LIKENED TO A </p><p>VICTORY CELEBRATION FOR THE OPPOSITION.  THE EVENT WAS, </p><p>IN FACT, ATTENDED BY OVER 700 PERSONS REPRESENTING ALL </p><p>SECTORS OF ZIMBABWEAN SOCIETY IN AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p>MANY OF THE MDC MEMBERS WHO ATTENDED OUR NATIONAL DAY </p><p>ARE PROMINENT CONSTITUTIONAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS, </p><p>DEMOCRACY ADVOCATES, AND OTHER CIVIL SOCIETY ACTIVISTS </p><p>WITH WHOM EMBOFFS HAVE REGULAR CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT\'S REFUSAL TO </p><p>ACCREDIT ELECTION OBSERVERS FROM IRI AND NDI ONLY DAYS </p><p>BEFORE THE ELECTION (AND THEREBY RENEGING ON PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE\'S PUBLIC PLEDGE TO WELCOME ANY AND ALL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS BE THEY NON-BRITISH), </p><p>CONSTITUTES, IN OUR VIEW, ANOTHER STRIKE AT AMERICA. </p><p>WHILE THE AMERICAN GROUPS WERE TWO OF SEVERAL EXCLUDED, </p><p>AMONG THEM THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES, WE HAVE LITTLE </p><p>DOUBT THAT THE U.S. WAS THE OBJECT OF THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORT TO BAR NON-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: WE SENSE A DISTINCT CHILLING IN THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6327 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03634  02 OF 02  050953Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------6A440A  050953Z /38 </p><p>O 050956Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6506 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003634 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/05/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI, US </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE SENDS SIGNALS OF </p><p>DISPLEASURE WITH USG </p><p> </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT HERE HAS </p><p>HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03634  02 OF 02  050953Z </p><p>ELECTIONS AND TAKEN STOCK OF OUR WORDS AND ACTIONS.  SO </p><p>FAR, THE ZIMBABWEANS\' ACTIONS HAVE HEWED TO THE PETTY. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, WE CANNOT RULE OUT PRESIDENT MUGABE MAKING </p><p>US A PRINCIPAL TARGET OF HIS POST PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION </p><p>GOVERNANCE STRATEGY AND HIS PRESIDENTIAL RE-ELECTION </p><p>CAMPAIGN, WHICH WE PERCEIVE HAS JUST STARTED IN EARNEST. </p><p>MUGABE IS CLEARLY LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME FOR HIS </p><p>PARTY\'S RESOUNDING REJECTION IN THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
