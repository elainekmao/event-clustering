<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001090 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF (PERRY), AF/RA, AF/PD, AF/W, OIIP, R </p><p>EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES FOR PAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, SCUL, OEXC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: INITIAL REACTIONS TO POST INITIATIVES TO ENGAGE </p><p>MOSTLY MUSLIM NORTHERN NIGERIA IN THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This cable reports initial reactions from two Post </p><p>initiatives to engage mostly Muslim northern Nigeria in the </p><p>wake of the 9/11 attacks.  (Large numbers of Muslims are </p><p>also in other parts of Nigeria, especially the populous </p><p>southwest.  Nigeria probably has the largest Muslim </p><p>population in all of Africa.)  The initiatives are </p><p>"Magama", a Hausa-language monthly magazine, and a series </p><p>of targeted mailings to Muslim leaders.  Some have decried </p><p>our efforts as American propaganda and even those who </p><p>praised the Embassy for undertaking direct communication in </p><p>Hausa were not always swayed by the policy arguments </p><p>conveyed. But the reaction so far has been overwhelmingly </p><p>positive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The first issue of "Magama", distributed at the end of </p><p>January, went to 5,000 influential Hausa speakers in </p><p>northern Nigeria.  Its content was heavily oriented toward </p><p>the U.S. response to terror and the effects of that </p><p>response--especially in Afghanistan, which had been </p><p>liberated from Taliban control.   The cover photo was a </p><p>close-up of a smiling Afghan woman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  The very first response we received was from a radio </p><p>commentator at popular Aso Radio across town in Abuja.  He </p><p>read excerpts of the incriminating Bin Laden tape taken </p><p>from "Magama".  Upon leaving the station that day, he was </p><p>accosted by some angry young men who accused him of being </p><p>an American propagandist.  He defended reading the excerpt </p><p>and, in fact, asked for an extra 10 copies of the magazine. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Another response reflected a similar division between </p><p>radical and moderate Muslims.  In Kaduna, a hotbed of fiery </p><p>Muslim clerics, a sheikh walked into the mosque before </p><p>Friday prayers a week ago holding a copy of "Magama", which </p><p>he showed to the Muslim faithful already seated in the </p><p>mosque.  He denounced "Magama" as "an attempt by America to </p><p>spread propaganda because they know we are unhappy with </p><p>their attacks on Muslim brothers in Afghanistan."  The </p><p>sheikh also condemned the recent visit to Nigeria by U.S. </p><p>Speaker, Dr. Aly Abuzaakouk, who spoke to both Christians </p><p>and Muslims about peaceful co-existence through interfaith </p><p>dialogue.  Fortunately, the Chief Imam arrived and </p><p>countered the sheikh\'s claims about "Magama".  He told the </p><p>congregation that "Magama" was not propaganda, but a means </p><p>of sharing information on U.S. policies towards Islam and </p><p>other issues.  He said "Magama" should be seen as an </p><p>instrument of peace, not conflict.  He also said the U.S. </p><p>took the right decision by bringing Dr. Abuzaakouk to talk </p><p>about peace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Some other reactions, in the form of letters or personal </p><p>encounters, from readers of the first issue: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I am writing to you to show my appreciation to you for </p><p>creating this important magazine, "MAGAMA."  It shows </p><p>thoughtfulness and foresight on the part of the Public </p><p>Affairs Section of the American Embassy to keep the </p><p>community well informed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I would like to use this opportunity to call on all </p><p>Northerners, other Nigerians and Hausa speakers in general </p><p>to show interest in "MAGAMA" and to read the Magazine </p><p>regularly.  I have no doubt in my mind that by reading </p><p>"MAGAMA" our people would be more enlightened on U.S. </p><p>policies and other World affairs, such as the question of </p><p>the State of Palestine." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I commend the wisdom of the United States Ambassador to </p><p>Nigeria Mr. Howard Jeter in starting this magazine, and for </p><p>finding time to explain America\'s bilateral assistance to </p><p>the developing world with details of the war against </p><p>terrorists." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I am very pleased with the introduction of this magazine, </p><p>aimed at explaining in detail the war against terror.  This </p><p>magazine is very important because it will help educate a </p><p>large number of Muslims, who erroneously believe that this </p><p>war is against Islam, and that America is only using Usama </p><p>bin Laden as a scapegoat to justify the war.  Now your </p><p>magazine is proving that this notion is not true, just as </p><p>it is in the Holy Koran, which says that no one has a right </p><p>to take another person\'s life." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I read your report suggesting that before the Taliban, </p><p>Afghan women were allowed to go to work and that in other </p><p>democracies women contribute in nation building as medical </p><p>doctors, nurses, teachers, journalists, judges and so on. </p><p>I would like to inform you that Islam forbids women from </p><p>mixing freely with men just for the sake of seeking earthly </p><p>rewards.  Islam allows women to attend marriages, naming </p><p>ceremonies, condolences, and to visit their families, but </p><p>for a woman to just go out and do the kind of things your </p><p>magazine talks about is improper.  It is against Islam.  If </p><p>these are the kinds of story your magazine wants to </p><p>circulate, I don\'t want to read your magazine again." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want to express my displeasure with the sufferings that </p><p>Muslims have been subjected to by America\'s unjust war </p><p>against Islam.  The aim of this war is to destroy Islam, </p><p>which is impossible. I would like to continue reading your </p><p>magazine." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It is very good that you are communicating with us in our </p><p>language, but you should cut back the propaganda; it is too </p><p>heavy.  We want to read more about Nigeria and Africa." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  In addition to publishing "Magama" (the second edition </p><p>just hit the streets), Post has begun to translate </p><p>Washington File items into Hausa and distribute them not </p><p>only to the usual media contacts, but to a growing list-- </p><p>now totaling 167--of Muslim leaders: clerics, legislators, </p><p>traditional rulers, youth leaders, Islamic scholars, </p><p>teachers, and women\'s leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Again the response has been strongly positive.  We have </p><p>placed our translated policy items in influential print and </p><p>broadcast media in northern Nigeria.  One of the radio </p><p>stations alone--FRCN Kaduna--reaches 25-30 million </p><p>listeners.  Following are some of the reactions from the </p><p>Muslim leaders, most of whom are pleased to get the </p><p>materials and want us to continue: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It was thoughtful of you to deem it appropriate to send to </p><p>us such wonderful and informative articles on happenings in </p><p>the United States as a fallout from what befell the U.S. on </p><p>11th September, 2001.  The gesture will facilitate a better </p><p>understanding of U.S. policies in this war against terror." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"While the forum members are open to dialogue, we believe </p><p>that the US will contribute to world peace by fighting </p><p>injustice wherever it exists, putting a halt to its </p><p>selective war against innocent Muslims.  The first place to </p><p>begin is Palestine.  Yes, we are interested in receiving </p><p>these articles." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The documents enclosed are indeed most educative and </p><p>refreshing.  I wish to point out that there is no mention </p><p>of African Muslims\' contributions in the on-going public </p><p>dialogue and look forward to having such." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I particularly like the abridged paper of Dr. Diana L. </p><p>Eck.  Though I am aware that the U.S. Government is </p><p>tolerant of religious pluralism, the paper in question did </p><p>put the magnitude of such tolerance in clearer </p><p>perspective." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We would like to thank you for your articles and reports </p><p>on terrorism, including the original Arabic transcript of </p><p>the alleged Usama bin Laden video tape.  We shall make our </p><p>thought on the issues known to you in due course, while </p><p>looking forward to more articles in the future." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I am happy that you realized that we are in the capacity </p><p>to organize and educate our fellow brothers and sisters </p><p>about the policies of the United States of America on the </p><p>war against terrorism, which I am made to understand after </p><p>going through the articles, is not directed towards Muslims </p><p>or the Islamic religion." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Post plans to expand the circulation of "Magama" by </p><p>1000 copies per issue and we will ratchet up the size four </p><p>pages per issue from the current 16 inside pages until we </p><p>reach 32 pages.  This will allow us to give more generous </p><p>coverage to US-Nigerian relations; MPP issues like </p><p>democracy, bilateral cooperation on law enforcement, </p><p>HIV/AIDS, and regional security and the mil-to-mil </p><p>relationship, while keeping a strong focus on the War on </p><p>Terror. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
