<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 03747 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, ECON, SY, IR, LE, IZ, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SYRIA AND IRAN ON LEBANON:  WHO THREATENS WHOM? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  DAMASCUS 3628 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  IN ITS PRESENT SPARRING WITH IRAN, SYRIA </p><p>PROBABLY DOES NOT HOLD A STRONG LEBANON CARD.  IRAN </p><p>NOW VIES WITH ISRAEL AS THE SECOND-MOST INFLUENTIAL </p><p>FOREIGN POWER IN LEBANON, WHERE SHI\'A FUNDAMENTALISM, </p><p>NATURALLY ASSOCIATED WITH IRAN, HAS BECOME WELL-INGRAINED. </p><p>SYRIA COULD CAUSE IRAN SHORT-TERM DIFFICULTIES BY </p><p>TERMINATING THE IRANIAN PRESENCE IN BA\'LBAKK, AND IT </p><p>COULD AT GREAT COST ATTACK HIZBALLAH (JUST AS IT COULD </p><p>THEORETICALLY ATTACK THE MARONITES).  HOWEVER, TO DO SO </p><p>WOULD NOT ONLY BE A DEPARTURE FROM SYRIA\'S POST-1978 </p><p>POLICY OF KEEPING COSTS DOWN IN LEBANON, IT WOULD RISK </p><p>CHANGING THE SHI\'A INTO ACTIVE ANTAGONISTS AGAINST SYRIA. </p><p>THIS POTENTIALLY WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE FOR SYRIA, BOTH IN </p><p>LEBANON AND WITHIN SYRIA ITSELF.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  EVENTS SURROUNDING THE FAILURE OF THE IRAQI-SYRIA </p><p>BORDER MEETING SUGGEST THAT THE IRAN-SYRIA RELATIONSHIP </p><p>HAS SURVIVED A ROCKY PERIOD.  THE PRINCIPAL IRRITANTS </p><p>WERE SYRIA\'S ECONOMIC NEED AND THE TWO COUNTRIES\' SHARPLY </p><p>DIVERGENT GOALS IN LEBANON.  IF THE RELATIONSHIP SEEMS </p><p>FOR THE MOMENT TO HAVE GONE BACK TO "NORMAL," IT IS </p><p>EVIDENTLY BECAUSE THE IRANIANS HAVE GIVEN THE SYRIANS TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT OIL SUPPLY WILL RESUME WITHOUT SERIOUS </p><p>DEMAND FOR PAYMENT EITHER FOR PRESENT OR PAST SHIPMENTS. </p><p>BUT WHERE DOES LEBANON FIT INTO THE EQUATION?  IT SEEMS </p><p>AXIOMATIC THAT FUNDAMENTALIST IRAN AND SECULAR SYRIA ARE </p><p>ON A LONG-TERM COLLISION COURSE IN LEBANON AND THAT THEY </p><p>HAVE NOT ALTERED THEIR GOALS IN LEBANON, AND WILL NOT DO </p><p>SO.  IN THE MOST RECENT SPARRING, THE QUESTION ARISES </p><p>WHETHER IRAN FELT CONSTRAINED BY THE PROSPECT OF A SYRIAN </p><p>CLAMPDOWN AGAINST HIZBALLAH, OR--TO THE CONTRARY, AS SOME </p><p>PRESS REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED--WHETHER SYRIA FELT ALARMED </p><p>OVER POSSIBLE IRAN/HIZBALLAH ACTIONS AGAINST SYRIAN </p><p>INTERESTS.  WHO THREATENS  WHOM OVER LEBANON? </p><p> </p><p>4.  WE DOUBT THAT IRANIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>BESHARATI DELIVERED BALD THREATS TO THE SYRIANS WHEN HE </p><p>MADE HIS JUNE 5-15 TRIP TO SYRIA AND LEBANON.  BUT WE </p><p>ARE STRUCK BY THE BOLDNESS OF HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND </p><p>ACTIONS; THE HIGH LEVEL AT WHICH HE WAS RECEIVED IN </p><p>DAMASCUS BEFORE AND AFTER GOING TO LEBANON--WHERE HE </p><p>ENGAGED IN A NEGOTIATING TRACK ON THE CAMPS WAR SEPARATE </p><p>FROM KHADDAM\'S--; SYRIA\'S POSITIVE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON </p><p>IRAN SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE FAILURE OF THE IRAQ-SYRIA </p><p>BORDER MEETING; AND INDICATORS OF SYRIAN TIMIDITY TOWARD </p><p>IRAN VIS-A-VIS LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>5.  OF THESE INDICATORS, WE NOTE ESPECIALLY LEBANON </p><p>BA\'TH PARTY CHIEF \'ASIM QANSUH\'S REMARKS JUNE 12 (REFTEL). </p><p>QANSUH WAS PROVEN WRONG ABOUT SYRIAN MILITARY </p><p>INTERVENTION AT MASHGHARA--THE SYRIANS DID EVENTUALLY AND </p><p>TARDILY INTERVENE--AND ONE FACTOR IN SYRIAN HESITANCY </p><p>MAY HAVE BEEN CONCERN ABOUT ISRAELI REACTION. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, IT IS CLEAR FROM WHAT QANSUH SAID THAT THE </p><p>SYRIANS WERE RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON HIZBALLAH AND OFFEND </p><p>IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN OUR VIEW, NEITHER SYRIA NOR IRAN IS IN A POSITION </p><p>IN LEBANON TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THREATS.  EACH HAS </p><p>REASON TO BE ALARMED AT THE OTHER\'S ACTIVITIES AND </p><p>AMBITIONS IN LEBANON, BUT THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH </p><p>ELSEWHERE--FOR SYRIA, THE PROSPECT OF VIRTUALLY FREE OIL </p><p>IN LARGE QUANTITY--TO ALLOW LEBANON TO SOUR THE OVERALL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  SYRIA HAS GIVEN IRAN A FEW KNOCKS IN LEBANON, BUT </p><p>NONE OF THESE HAS BEEN LARGE ENOUGH TO HARM THE RELATION- </p><p>SHIP.  SYRIA CLAMPED DOWN ON IRAN\'S SUNNI ALLIES IN </p><p>TRIPOLI, IT HAS ENGAGED IN OCCASIONAL ALTERCATIONS WITH </p><p>HIZBALLAH, AND NOW IT HAS INTERVENED IN MASHGHARA BECAUSE </p><p>OF HIZBALLAH\'S ATTACKS AGAINST ITS SSNP ALLY.  BUT WHAT </p><p>SYRIA HAS FAILED TO DO IS MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE.  THE </p><p>IRANIAN GUARD PRESENCE IN SYRIAN-"CONTROLLED" LEBANON </p><p>CONTINUES AS BEFORE; IRAN CONTINUES TO MOVE SUPPLIES TO </p><p>HIZBALLAH VIA SYRIA, VIRTUALLY UNIMPEDED; AND THE SYRIANS </p><p>HAVE BEEN LIMP AND INEFFECTUAL IN PUSHING IRAN ON THE </p><p>HOSTAGES.  MEANWHILE, AS HIZBALLAH HAS GAINED IN STRENGTH </p><p>IN RECENT YEARS, SO HAS IRANIAN INFLUENCE IN LEBANON </p><p>INCREASED MARKEDLY.  IRAN NOW, WE WOULD JUDGE, VIES WITH </p><p>ISRAEL AS THE SECOND-MOST INFLUENTIAL FOREIGN POWER IN </p><p>LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>8.  BY ALLOWING A REVOLUTIONARY GUARD PRESENCE AND GIVING </p><p>THE IRANIANS EASY ACCESS SINCE 1982, SYRIA MAY HAVE </p><p>ACCELERATED THE PACE OF GROWTH OF HIZBALLAH AND IRANIAN </p><p>INFLUENCE.  HOWEVER, THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION IS THE SINGLE </p><p>MOST DYNAMIC AND ALLURING MOVEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST OVER </p><p>THE PAST DECADE; IT WAS BOUND TO HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY </p><p>IMPACT ON THE LEBANESE SHI\'A COMMUNITY.  IT IS OPEN TO </p><p>QUESTION HOW MUCH SYRIA COULD HAVE DONE TO STEM THE TIDE. </p><p>THERE ALWAYS WERE, AND STILL ARE, OTHER ROUTES--THAN </p><p>THROUGH SYRIA--FOR IRAN TO REACH AND INFLUENCE THE HIGHLY </p><p>RECEPTIVE LEBANESE SHI\'A.  THE SYRIANS HAVE ACTIVELY </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO COUNTERBALANCE THE IRANIANS BY GIVING SUPPORT </p><p>TO NABIH BARRI, BUT WITH WHAT LONG-TERM EFFECT REMAINS </p><p>TO BE SEEN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SYRIANS OCCASIONALLY TELL US THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE </p><p>TO CONTAIN THE LEBANESE SHI\'A "WHEN THE NEED ARISES." </p><p>HOWEVER, WE THINK THAT THEIR BOAST IS HOLLOW AND THAT </p><p>THE SYRIANS WELL KNOW IT.  THEY HAVE MADE THE BEST OF THE </p><p>SITUATION BY MILKING THE IRANIANS--KEEPING THAT </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BOTH CORDIAL AND LUCRATIVE--WHILE ATTEMPTING </p><p>TO BOLSTER BARRI.  THE FUTURE MUST BE WORRISOME. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE REAL TEST OF WHETHER SYRIA CAN OR WILL ACT </p><p>AGAINST IRAN/HIZBALLAH WILL COME IF IRAN\'S PROMISES OF </p><p>CONTINUED OIL DELIVERIES PROVE FALSE.  EVEN THEN, HOWEVER, </p><p>WE WOULD PREDICT THAT THE SYRIANS WILL MOVE IN A </p><p>GINGERLY FASHION.  THE ULTIMATE PROSPECT IS OF A </p><p>LEBANESE SHI\'A COMMUNITY ALIENATED FROM SYRIA AND, </p><p>POSSIBLY, WITH IRANIAN SUPPORT ENERGIZED TO COMBAT SYRIA. </p><p>IF SYRIA WENT TOO FAR IN ALIENATING IRAN/HIZBALLAH, IT </p><p>MIGHT EVEN FACE AN ACTIVE IRANIAN/HIZBALLAH EMBRACE OF </p><p>THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  THE MOST RADICAL (ALSO </p><p>THE MOST DANGEROUS) ELEMENTS OF THE BROTHERHOOD ARE </p><p>ANTAGONISTIC TO IRAN BECAUSE OF IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>HERETICAL ALAWI BA\'THI REGIME; IF THAT SUPPORT WERE </p><p>REMOVED, THE NATURAL AFFINITY THAT IRAN HAS FOR THIS </p><p>GROUP WOULD PRESUMABLY COME TO THE FORE.  THE PRECEDENT </p><p>FOR FUNDAMENTALIST SUNNI-SHI\'A COOPERATION HAS ALREADY </p><p>BEEN ESTABLISHED IN TRIPOLI. </p><p> </p><p>11.  IN ANY CASE, A STRONG SYRIAN MOVE AGAINST HIZBALLAH </p><p>WOULD RUN AGAINST THE GRAIN OF SYRIAN POLICY IN LEBANON </p><p>AS ESTABLISHED OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS.  AT THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE CIVIL WAR (1976-78) SYRIA INTERVENED </p><p>DIRECTLY IN MAJOR FIGHTING, AT GREAT COST; SINCE THEN IT </p><p>HAS PURSUED A LOW-COST POLICY, TRYING TO BALANCE PARTIES </p><p>AGAINST EACH OTHER AND USING PROXIES IN LIMITED </p><p>ENGAGEMENTS.  DESPITE PREDICTIONS TO THE CONTRARY AND </p><p>DESPITE THE EMBARRASSING FAILURE OF THE TRIPARTITE ACCORD, </p><p>THE SYRIANS HAVE BACKED OFF FROM ATTACKING THE MARONITES. </p><p>THE PROSPECT OF A FULL-SCALE ATTACK AGAINST HIZBALLAH IS </p><p>EVEN MORE REMOTE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  HOWEVER, LIMITED ENGAGEMENTS ARE BOUND TO CONTINUE. </p><p>MASHGHARA IS A CASE IN POINT.  THE SYRIANS ARE ESPECIALLY </p><p>NERVOUS ABOUT SOUTHERN LEBANON, BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL </p><p>THERE FOR ROUSING THE ISRAELIS.  THE SHI\'A OF SOUTHERN </p><p>LEBANON HAVE ALSO, THUS FAR, BEEN THE LEAST RECEPTIVE TO </p><p>HIZBALLAH.  WITH MASHGHARA THE SYRIANS MAY BE NERVOUSLY </p><p>DRAWING A LINE WHICH THEY HOPE HIZBALLAH AND IRAN WILL </p><p>ACCEPT, FOR THE TIME BEING. </p><p> </p><p>13.  BEIRUT MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>RANSOM </p><p></p></div>
