(SBU) Summary.  On March 3, President Maduro announced a </p><p>number of retaliatory countermeasures against Nicaragua </p><p>including a 35 percent tariff on goods and increased fees </p><p>for the use of Puerto Cortez and national highways.  The </p><p>retaliatory action by the GOH is the latest chapter in the </p><p>long-running dispute between Honduras and Nicaragua over </p><p>their maritime boundary.  The GOH hopes that this action </p><p>will force the GON to repeal the 35 percent tariff they </p><p>imposed in 1999 in response to the ratification of a </p><p>maritime treaty between Colombia and Honduras recognizing </p><p>the 15th parallel as the maritime boundary.  The </p><p>announcement of the countermeasures has allowed Maduro to </p><p>look proactive, boost his popularity ratings and has </p><p>provided the GOH the leverage against Nicaragua.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On March 3, President Ricardo Maduro announced that </p><p>he was sending to the Congress a decree to apply retaliatory </p><p>countermeasures against Nicaragua in response to the GON\'s </p><p>failure to repeal the 35 percent tariff that was imposed in </p><p>1999.  The retaliatory countermeasures include a matching 35 </p><p>percent tariff on all Nicaraguan goods and increased fees </p><p>for the use of Puerto Cortez and national highways.  In the </p><p>announcement, Maduro stated that the Nicaraguan tariff had </p><p>severely damaged the Honduran economy and called on the GON </p><p>to abandon its anti-integrationist position. Further, he </p><p>noted that the measure Nicaraguan President Bolanos had </p><p>proposed to send to the Nicaraguan National Assembly to </p><p>temporarily repeal the tariff was unsatisfactory.  If the </p><p>tariffs are imposed, Honduras believes they would deal a </p><p>serious blow to the Nicaraguan economy, especially the </p><p>coffee industry, since almost 100 percent of Nicaraguan </p><p>exports pass through Puerto Cortez. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The GOH\'s announcement of the imposition of </p><p>retaliatory tariffs against Nicaragua is the latest chapter </p><p>in their long-running dispute over their maritime boundary. </p><p>The dispute began when Honduras ratified a maritime treaty </p><p>with Colombia in 1999, recognizing the 15th parallel as the </p><p>maritime boundary.  That same year, Nicaragua retaliated by </p><p>filing an ICJ case and more importantly, imposing a 35 </p><p>percent tariff on Honduran goods and services.  The </p><p>Nicaraguan tariff has remained in place despite a Central </p><p>American Court of Justice ruling that it is illegal. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) With former Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman </p><p>deposed as President of the National Assembly, the GOH had </p><p>expressed optimism in the last few months that Bolanos would </p><p>make good on private assurances to lift the tariff and </p><p>thereby take an important step toward regional economic </p><p>integration.  The ongoing U.S.-Central America Free Trade </p><p>Agreement (U.S.-CAFTA) negotiations and the recent ICJ </p><p>ruling in favor of the GOH\'s petition against the tariff </p><p>were viewed as additional incentives. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment:  After three years of restraint, the GOH </p><p>finally reached the point where they felt the leverage </p><p>provided by Honduran countermeasures was the only way to </p><p>ensure repeal of the Nicaraguan sanctions.  The Honduran </p><p>Congress was prepared to consider a retaliatory tariff bill </p><p>in January, but postponed the action after public assurances </p><p>from Bolanos.  However, after intense pressure from the </p><p>Honduran business community in the last two weeks, Maduro </p><p>promised to take action after a ten-day waiting period.  By </p><p>taking the initiative, Maduro was able to look proactive, </p><p>possibly boost his sagging popularity and deflect attention </p><p>from the recently introduced tax package.  Further, the </p><p>announcement of the retaliatory measures solidified his </p><p>support in the business community. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) There still remains a possibility that the GON will </p><p>repeal the 35 percent tariff in the next week to avoid both </p><p>the countermeasures and regional squabbling during the U.S.- </p><p>CAFTA negotiations.  We understand that there have been </p><p>discussions between the countries Congressional Vice </p><p>Presidents in an attempt to resolve the issue before </p><p>countermeasures are enacted.  If the sanctions are adopted, </p><p>vested interests may develop, making repeal both politically </p><p>and economically difficult.  The Honduran press is already </p><p>quoting figures on badly needed government revenue that will </p><p>accrue from the countermeasures.  It remains to be seen </p><p>whether the Honduran proposal will only add fuel to an </p><p>already volatile situation or act as the final catalyst to </p><p>successfully repeal the Nicaraguan tariff. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
