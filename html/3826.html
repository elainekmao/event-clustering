<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002766 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: COMMONWEALTH TROIKA ON ZIMBABWE -- A </p><p>MEXICAN STANDOFF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM ANDREWS. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Presidential International Affairs Advisor </p><p>Ad\'Obe Obe September 25 told Polcouns that the September 23 </p><p>Commonwealth Troika meeting ended in stalemate. Australian PM </p><p>Howard pushed to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth and </p><p>for other sanctions to show displeasure over GOZ land </p><p>seizures and stalled political negotiations with Mugabe\'s </p><p>opposition. Diametrically opposite Howard was South Africa\'s </p><p>Mbeki, who insisted the Troika lacked the mandate to suspend </p><p>Zimbabwe or authorize sanctions. He wanted to give Zimbabwe </p><p>and Mugabe more time to work toward political dialogue. </p><p>Somewhere between, but clearly leaning towards Mugabe, stood </p><p>Obasanjo. With neither Howard nor Mbeki softening his </p><p>position, Obasanjo ultimately sided with Mbeki, and the </p><p>meeting ended with no action taken against Zimbabwe.  End </p><p>Ssummary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a September 25 meeting with PolCouns, </p><p>Presidential Advisor Obe stated that the Abuja Troika was </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s idea. On the margins of the WSSD, </p><p>Obasanjo met serially with Australian PM Howard, South </p><p>African President Mbeki and Mugabe.  All three agreed to the </p><p>Abuja meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Trouble started when Howard, asserting his prerogative </p><p>as current Commonwealth Chairman, took it upon himself to </p><p>organize the meeting.  In tandem with Commonwealth Secretary </p><p>General McKinnon, Howard prepared the agenda and invitations </p><p>with minimal consultations with Abuja and presumably </p><p>Pretoria, commented Obe. Feeling that Howard was hijacking </p><p>the meeting, Obasanjo briefly considered its cancellation but </p><p>thought that would do more harm than good. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Obe described the invitation to Mugabe as insulting. </p><p>The only plausible explanation for the invitation\'s terseness </p><p>was an intention to provoke the Zimbabwean leader, Obe </p><p>maintained. Adding to the perceived insult, the invitation </p><p>was publicized on the Internet. Mugabe, believing his public </p><p>humiliation and embarrassment was Howard\'s aim, decided </p><p>against attending the session.  Obasanjo attempted to </p><p>convince Mugabe to rethink his nonattendance by stating that </p><p>the issues raised by Howard were mere points for discussion, </p><p>not foregone conclusions.  Obasanjo\'s entreaty was </p><p>ineffectual.  At the end of their conversations, Mugabe </p><p>sealed his absence by offering that he would attend on the </p><p>condition that the status of Australia\'s Aborigines was the </p><p>first item discussed by the Troika. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Upon hearing that Mugabe changed his mind, Mbeki also </p><p>decided not to show. According to Obe, there was a flurry of </p><p>phone calls between Howard, Obasanjo and Mbeki.  After much </p><p>heavy pushing, Mbeki was turned back toward to Abuja. By then </p><p>however, pre-meeting atmospherics were decidedly negative and </p><p>this palpable tension was an active participant in the Abuja </p><p>meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In Abuja, Howard strongly advocated that the Troika </p><p>toss the book at Mugabe by suspending Zimbabwe from the </p><p>Commonwealth for the land seizures and for stalling the </p><p>political dialogue. Mbeki steadfastly opposed Howard, </p><p>claiming the Troika lacked the mandate to suspend Zimbabwe </p><p>from the Commonwealth or to approve other sanctions. </p><p>Initially, Obasanjo tried to find middle ground then pull </p><p>Howard and Mbeki toward consensus so that the meeting could </p><p>end with a unified position. However, neither Mbeki nor </p><p>Howard budged, forcing Obasanjo to decide between the two. </p><p>Predictably, Obasanjo cast his deciding vote in Mbeki\'s favor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) According to Obe, the meeting rekindled the tempers </p><p>that flared during the Commonwealth Summit in Australia. </p><p>There, African leaders criticized British PM Blair for </p><p>failing to give sufficient weight to the history of social </p><p>and racial injustice underlying the GOZ position on land </p><p>seizures.  This time in Abuja, Mbeki took Howard to task for </p><p>being insensitive to Zimbabwe\'s history. Becoming </p><p>increasingly animated, Obe stated that both Howard and </p><p>Commonwealth Secretary McKinnon were not attempting to be </p><p>impartial, but were carrying Britain\'s water at this meeting. </p><p> He stressed that both Mbeki and Obasanjo were rankled that </p><p>the British and Howard seemed indifferent to the equities and </p><p>emotions underlying the Zimbabwean land dispute. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The British lend more weight to the plight of 4,000 </p><p>farmers than the whole issue of Zimbabwean independence, Obe </p><p>bristled. Mugabe had repeatedly stated the independence </p><p>struggle was over land. There were black Zimbabweans who </p><p>remembered living on and owning the farms now occupied by </p><p>white farmers. If those lands did not devolve to the blacks, </p><p>the struggle for independence would be incomplete.  It was </p><p>this quest to gain recompense for past injustices that made </p><p>most African leaders sympathetic to Mugabe, Obe asserted. </p><p>Unless the West realized the strength of this sentiment, </p><p>there would be continued friction and misunderstanding </p><p>between the West and Africa concerning the way forward in </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Reflecting on the dynamics at the Troika meeting, Obe </p><p>remarked that it was naive to expect Mbeki to energetically </p><p>oppose Mugabe. The rank-and-file in Mbeki\'s ANC strongly </p><p>sympathized with Mugabe. If Mbeki openly sided with Britain </p><p>against Mugabe, he would suffer a tremendous domestic back </p><p>lash, particularly given that South Africa\'s day of reckoning </p><p>on the land redistribution lies in the future, Obe opined. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) While Nigeria did not have to grapple with the same </p><p>dilemma facing Mbeki and South Africa, President Obasanjo </p><p>felt some personal responsibility for Zimbabwe, Obe </p><p>continued. In 1979, then military Head of State Obasanjo </p><p>encouraged Mugabe to accept the proposed Zimbabwean </p><p>constitution, which placed a 10-year moratorium on the land </p><p>question. In 1989, when the 10-year ban ended, then African </p><p>statesman Obasanjo joined the chorus of other voices </p><p>counseling Mugabe not to move forward with land reform. It </p><p>was feared that events in Zimbabwe could cause apartheid </p><p>hard-liners to retrench in South Africa and scuttle the </p><p>emergent reforms beginning to take place.  Having twice </p><p>advised Mugabe to idle himself, Obasanjo now felt some </p><p>sympathy for the principle underlying Mugabe\'s actions, </p><p>although he did not agree with Mugabe\'s tactics. </p><p>Consequently, Obasanjo was very reluctant to excoriate the </p><p>Zimbabwean and instead wanted to maintain dialogue with him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Regarding Mugabe, Obe posited that Mugabe generally </p><p>had accomplished his goals on land seizures; he considered </p><p>himself as presenting the world with a fait accompli as to </p><p>the farms recently seized. However, Obe pointed out Mugabe </p><p>was careful that his land seizures did not leave affected </p><p>farmers landless. He only seized the lands of people who </p><p>owned multiple farms. Because Mugabe was more comfortable </p><p>with what he has done on land redistribution, now might be </p><p>the best time to nudge him to a more conciliatory stance on </p><p>internal political dialogue, Obe offered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Comment: By his very nature, Obe is an acerbic, </p><p>sometimes combative personality, so his comments must be seen </p><p>in this light. The friction attendant at the Abuja Troika </p><p>might not be quite as intense as he described. However, he is </p><p>not prone to invent things that did not happen. We think his </p><p>account is generally indicative of what happened.  Thus, </p><p>instead of bridging the differences between the African </p><p>leaders and the Western outlooks on Zimbabwe, the Troika only </p><p>accentuated these divergent viewpoints. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
