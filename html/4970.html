<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000126 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/ESC/ESP, AND S/CT </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFFICE OF U/S FOR ENFORCEMENT (MICHAEL LEARY); </p><p>OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (MUNRO); OFFICE OF </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (SCHROEDER) </p><p>DOJ FOR CRIMINAL DIVISION/SECTION ON ASSET FORFEITURE </p><p>(SUZANNE HAYDEN) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EFIN, PTER, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE: SUCCESSFUL VISIT TO ANKARA BY </p><p>USG TEAM; NEED FOR FOLLOW-UP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: The December 16-18 visit of the Treasury </p><p>and Justice anti-terrorist finance team attracted intense GOT </p><p>interest.  The visit resulted in an interagency GOT decision, </p><p>at the senior working level, to recommend to policy-makers </p><p>amending their laws to adopt an OFAC-like authority.  Embassy </p><p>will follow-up with meetings with parliamentarians and </p><p>appropriate officials to gauge the interest in this proposal </p><p>at the political level.  USG team should provide further </p><p>details on OFAC, and considering passing to Embassy some </p><p>drafting suggestions for amending Turkish law, that Embassy </p><p>can share on a low-key basis with GOT counterparts.  If there </p><p>is political-level interest, then USG team might plan on a </p><p>follow-up visit to Ankara in the first quarter. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Successful Visit </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A Treasury/DOJ team of four anti-terrorist </p><p>financing legal experts held a series of meetings in Ankara </p><p>December 16 - 18.  The goal of the visit was to provide </p><p>practical advice to Turkish counterparts on upgrading </p><p>Turkey\'s legal regime, specifically, to give the Turks </p><p>suggestions for amending their laws to enable them to move </p><p>swiftly to block terrorist financing assets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The USG team\'s Turkish interlocutors at the senior </p><p>civil service level - in the Ministries of Justice, Finance, </p><p>Interior and Foreign Affairs, and in the independent </p><p>regulatory boards for Financial Crimes, Financial Inspection, </p><p>and Banking Regulation and Supervision - </p><p>agreed with the USG team\'s presentations on the need to amend </p><p>their laws, and want the USG team to remain engaged with them </p><p>as they proceed to amend the laws.  Even the most cautious of </p><p>the interlocutors, in the Justice Ministry\'s Directorate for </p><p>Legislation, agreed with the others on the need to add a </p><p>temporary, administrative blocking procedure, as long as it </p><p>didn\'t interfere with the GOT\'s existing ability to pursue </p><p>judicial prosecutions.  The Ministry of Justice officials </p><p>shared with the USG team draft amendments to their Combating </p><p>Terrorism Law which are intended to improve blocking of </p><p>terrorist financial assets.  Unfortunately, this draft was </p><p>not sufficient to use as a basis for upgrading Turkish laws; </p><p>the Turkish side recognized that more needed to be done. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  In the USG team\'s wrap-up session with all Turkish </p><p>participants, the team suggested two ways of amending Turkish </p><p>law to accomplish the joint goal of bolstering the GOT\'s </p><p>asset blocking capability.  These two suggestions are not </p><p>"either/or" but rather complementary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  First, as a "quick fix," the Turks should amend their </p><p>Combating Terrorism Law to provide clear and unambiguous </p><p>legal effect to the United Nations\' determinations with </p><p>respect to its lists of terrorist financiers, and delegate to </p><p>a single minister, or small group of ministers, authority to </p><p>immediately implement such UN determinations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Second, the Turks should consider amending their laws to </p><p>develop an administrative authority to block terrorist </p><p>financial assets using administrative procedures to </p><p>complement their current civil and criminal judicial </p><p>processes.  The team described the legal authorities and </p><p>administrative procedures used by the Treasury\'s OFAC as an </p><p>example of the U.S. method of implementing national </p><p>security-based economic sanctions regimes, such as blocking </p><p>terrorist-related assets.  The Turks were interested, and </p><p>U.S. Treasury promised to provide more details on setting up </p><p>an OFAC-type agency that the Turks could tailor to their </p><p>system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Immediate Follow-Up </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In follow-up meetings December 31 with Financial </p><p>Crimes Board (MASAK) Chairman Coskun and Financial Inspection </p><p>Board Chairman Tuncer, and with newly appointed Finance </p><p>Ministry U/S Hasan Basri Arioglu, we learned that the GOT\'s </p><p>Financial Crimes Coordinating Committee met on December 25. </p><p>(Note: This committee is chaired by the Finance Ministry U/S </p><p>and includes the heads of the six different inspection </p><p>boards, as well as senior bureaucrats from Justice, Finance, </p><p>MFA and other ministries.)  This Committee decided to revise </p><p>Turkish law to adopt a "civil in rem financial freezing </p><p>regime" - similar to an OFAC\'s authority - to cover three </p><p>kinds of illegal activity:  terrorist financing; drug </p><p>trafficking; and governmental corruption.  The Committee gave </p><p>members one month to provide proposed legal language to adopt </p><p>this facility.  Mention was made of the need to study EU </p><p>countries\' systems to see if they have such an authority </p><p>under their laws. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) MASAK Chairman Coskun told us that there has not </p><p>yet been contact at the political level on this </p><p>recommendation to adopt an OFAC-like authority.  The </p><p>Financial Crimes Coordinating Committee plans to justify the </p><p>urgency of this amendment by referring to the new </p><p>government\'s "Emergency Action Plan" which does refer to </p><p>adopting anti-corruption measures required by the OECD.  But, </p><p>Coskun noted,  the senior civil servants do not know the </p><p>general orientation of the AK Party leadership towards this </p><p>initiative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Other Fruit of the Visit </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In the December 31 meeting at the Financial </p><p>Inspector Board, the inspectors gave FBI attache some </p><p>information on financial transfers to Turkish banks and </p><p>non-bank financial institutions that appeared to be </p><p>"suspicious transactions."  FBI attache welcomed this </p><p>information sharing, and is organizing follow-on meetings </p><p>with FBI counterparts.  He will report through other </p><p>channels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment and Action Request </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The USG team\'s presentation attracted intense </p><p>interest and resulted in an immediate response - a decision </p><p>at the senior working level to recommend adoption of an </p><p>OFAC-like authority.  To help ensure this happens, both </p><p>Embassy and Washington agencies should follow-up with the </p><p>Turks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) Embassy will begin consultations with new members of </p><p>parliament to raise the need for action at the political </p><p>level, and to assess the level of political support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(b) OFAC Deputy Chief General Counsel Munro promised the </p><p>Turks a two-page description of OFAC including its legal and </p><p>regulatory authority.  This would be useful in providing </p><p>further detail to the Turks, as they move forward to engage </p><p>their political level. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(c) We recommend that the USG team consider drafting in the </p><p>next two weeks some specific amendment suggestions for </p><p>establishing a Turkish OFAC, and provide it to Embassy. </p><p>Embassy can then pass this language in a low-key fashion to </p><p>Turkish counterparts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(d) The USG team should remain engaged with appropriate </p><p>officials favoring an OFAC-style mechanism for blocking of </p><p>assets and civil in rem forfeiture.  The focus of this </p><p>engagement should be to refine draft legislation for eventual </p><p>parliamentarian consideration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) U.S. Department of Justice and Treasury team members </p><p>have cleared this cable. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
