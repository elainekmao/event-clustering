COPYRIGHT PIRACY LEVELS HAVE FALLEN </p><p>SHARPLY SINCE 2000, WHEN ITALY\'S NEW COPYRIGHT LAW WAS </p><p>ENACTED.  LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>PROBLEMS PERSIST, PARTICULARLY WITH THE JUDICIARY, CERTAIN </p><p>MUNICIPAL LEADERS, AND THE SIAE (ITALY\'S COPYRIGHT ROYALTY </p><p>COLLECTION AGENCY).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE IPR SITUATION IN ITALY IMPROVED DURING 2001, WITH </p><p>PIRACY LEVELS DROPPING BY OVER 30 PERCENT FROM 1999, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE IIPA.  THE ENACTMENT OF THE 2000 COPYRIGHT </p><p>LAW IN SEPTEMBER 2001 RAISED CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND LED TO A </p><p>NEW AWARENESS AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND THE PUBLIC </p><p>THAT PIRACY IS A CRIME.  LAW ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>IPR INDUSTRY HAS BEEN VERY GOOD, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE </p><p>CARABINIERI (NATIONAL POLICE WITHIN THE DEFENSE MINISTRY) AND </p><p>THE GUARDIA DI FINANZA (FISCAL POLICE WITHIN THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTRY).  FAR MORE ARRESTS HAVE MEANT LESS PIRACY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN CITIES WHERE THE MAYORS AND PREFECTS SUPPORT </p><p>POLICE EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. RESULTS HAVE VARIED FROM CITY TO CITY, DEPENDING UPON </p><p>MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE MAYOR AND PREFECT IN </p><p>ROME HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO ALLOW POLICE TO ACT AGGRESSIVELY </p><p>AGAINST STREET VENDERS OF PIRATED MATERIAL.  AS A RESULT, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01072  01 OF 02  281834Z </p><p>SUCH STREET SALES HAVE CONTINUED UNIMPEDED.  OFFICIALS IN </p><p>CERTAIN CITIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO STOP LOCAL CARABINIERI FROM </p><p>ACTING.  ON THE OTHER HAND, TRIESTE CITY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN </p><p>VERY SUPPORTIVE.  AS A RESULT, IN THAT CITY, STREET VENDORS </p><p>OF PIRATED MATERIAL HAVE ALMOST DISAPPEARED AND PIRACY RATES </p><p>ARE EXTREMELY LOW. </p><p> </p><p>4.   PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES VARY IN QUALITY AS WELL.  MANY </p><p>PROSECUTORS ARE UNWILLING TO BRING CRIMINAL  CHARGES AGAINST </p><p>STREET VENDORS, FACTORY WORKERS OR SHOP WORKERS.   JUDGES ARE </p><p>OFTEN UNWILLING TO CONVICT, ARGUING THAT "MINOR" ECONOMIC </p><p>CRIMES DO NOT JUSTIFY CRIMINAL TREATMENT.  ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>AS THE EMBASSY AND CGS HAVE HELD CONFERENCES AND SEMINARS </p><p>WITH THE JUDICIAL COMMUNITY, WE HAVE SEEN A GROWING NUMBER OF </p><p>MAGISTRATES TAKE THIS CRIME MORE SERIOUSLY.  SOME JUDGES HAVE </p><p>BECOME IMPORTANT ALLIES IN OUR EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE TYPE OF PIRACY HAS VARIED AS WELL.   ACCORDING TO </p><p>FAPAV (THE AUDIO-VISUAL ANTI-PIRACY ASSOCIATION), CASSETTE </p><p>PIRACY HAS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY.  HOWEVER, PIRATED DVDS HAVE </p><p>JUST BEGUN TO APPEAR, AND COULD BECOME A FAR MORE SERIOUS </p><p>PROBLEM.  "SMART-CARD" PIRACY -- COUNTERFEIT PAY-TV CARDS -- </p><p>IS EQUAL TO AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF THE PAY-TV MARKET IN ITALY </p><p>(REF B).  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE BUSINESS SOFTWARE ALLIANCE\'S </p><p>PRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF THE ITALIAN PIRACY RATES INDICATES </p><p>THAT THERE MAY BE A DECLINE IN WHITE COLLAR IN-FIRM ILLEGAL </p><p>DUPLICATION OF SOFTWARE.  REGARDING THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, THE </p><p>FIMI REP INDICATED THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH HOW MUCH </p><p>OF THE DECLINE IN CD SALES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PIRACY AND HOW </p><p>MUCH TO OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE HIGH PRICE OF CDS (OR JUST </p><p>"NOT VERY GOOD MUSIC").  HOWEVER, FIMI CONFIRMED THAT PIRACY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01072  01 OF 02  281834Z </p><p>IS A KEY PROBLEM WITH STREET VENDORS SWARMING CITY STREETS </p><p>WITH PIRATED CDS. </p><p> </p><p>SIAE:  INSPECTING FOR STICKERS, NOT PIRACY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  WE REMAIN CONCERNED BY THE INEFFECTIVE ANTI-PIRACY </p><p>EFFORTS OF SIAE, THE COPYRIGHT COLLECTION ENTITY. IPR </p><p>INDUSTRIES ARE WORKING INTENSIVELY -- WITH ACTIVE SUPPORT </p><p>FROM EMBASSY ROME AND CONSULATES MILAN, NAPLES AND FLORENCE </p><p>-- TO IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT AND EDUCATION.  HOWEVER, SIAE HAS </p><p>BEEN MORE AN OBSTACLE THAN AN ALLY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN ACCORD WITH ARTICLE 11 OF THE 2000 COPYRIGHT LAW, SIAE </p><p>IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANTI-PIRACY EFFORTS IN ITALY.  BECAUSE </p><p>SIAE RECEIVES ALL REVENUES FROM ITS STICKER, WHICH IS </p><p>REQUIRED FOR COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS UNDER THE LAW (WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF BUSINESS SOFTWARE), IT HAS ADEQUATE RESOURCES </p><p>FOR THESE EFFORTS.   HOWEVER, WE UNDERSTAND THAT SIAE HAS TO </p><p>DATE DIRECTED ITS EFFORTS SOLELY AT INSPECTING LEGITIMATE </p><p>COPYRIGHTED GOODS TO ENSURE THAT THESE CARRY A SIAE STICKER. </p><p> SIAE HAS DONE NOTHING, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, TO ACT AGAINST </p><p>ILLEGAL COPYRIGHTED GOODS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WE HAVE REPORTED  (REF C AND PREVIOUS) ON THE SIAE </p><p>STICKER ISSUE, AND OUR EFFORTS TO RESOLVE IT.

BSA AND SIAE HAVE HELD FOLLOW UP MEETINGS ON THE </p><p>SPECIFIC WORDING OF THE NEW REGULATION AND THE SPECIFIC </p><p>WORDING OF THE EXEMPTION REQUIREMENTS.   WE ARE MONITORING </p><p>THESE AND URGING SIAE TO MOVE QUICKLY. </p><p> </p><p>9.   INDUSTRY AND EMBASSY EFFORTS AT IPR EDUCATION AND </p><p>ENFORCEMENT, WHILE EXTENSIVE, ARE NOT ENOUGH.   OUR COMBINED </p><p>EFFORTS HAVE IMPROVED THE SITUATION, PARTICULARLY WITH LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT AND, IN SOME CASES, WITH THE JUDICIARY.  HOWEVER, </p><p>SIAE HAS THE NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE RESOURCES.   WE </p><p>HAVE PRESSED SIAE TO INVOLVE ITSELF IN EDUCATION AND </p><p>ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS, BUT HAVE SEEN NO ACTION YET. </p><p> </p><p>WIPO TREATIES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  ITALY HAS NOT YET RATIFIED THE 1996 WIPO INTERNET </p><p>TREATIES. </p><p> </p><p>AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING LEGISLATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>11.  ITALY HAS NOT AMENDED ITS 2000 COPYRIGHT LAW AND THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ENACTED IN 2001.  AS STATED ABOVE, </p><p>WE ARE PRESSING FOR AN AMENDMENT TO CERTAIN REGULATIONS TO </p><p>PERMIT ROUTINE EXEMPTIONS FROM THE SIAE STICKER FOR BUSINESS </p><p>SOFTWARE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01072  02 OF 02  281834Z </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT HAS RECENTLY APPROVED THE 2001 EU </p><p>DIRECTIVES OMNIBUS BILL, WHICH DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE GOI </p><p>TO INTEGRATE EU RULES GOVERNING COPYRIGHT INTO THE ITALIAN </p><p>LEGAL CODE . </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT SOFTWARE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  WE HAVE RECEIVED NO COMPLAINTS/INFORMATION REGARDING </p><p>GOVERNMENT USE OF PIRATED SOFTWARE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE INTERNATIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ALLIANCE (IIPA) </p><p>RECOMMENDS THAT ITALY REMAIN ON THE WATCH LIST.  IPR INDUSTRY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES HERE SHARE THAT ASSESSMENT.  WE AGREE. </p><p>PIRACY HAS FALLEN BY OVER 30 PERCENT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS -- </p><p>SINCE ITALY PASSED ITS TOUGH COPYRIGHT LAW IN 2000 -- BUT </p><p>MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01072 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
