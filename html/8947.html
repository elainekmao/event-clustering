(SBU) Over the last several months in Croatia, </p><p>several pieces of legislation have been introduced which </p><p>seek to regulate the import and cultivation of biotech </p><p>crops and foods.  The embassy and FAS Vienna have </p><p>engaged the government on a number of fronts to stop </p><p> to stop </p><p>legislation that, in the case of one parliamentary </p><p>proposal, would temporarily ban GM products.  We are </p><p>also trying to soften restrictive measures that are </p><p>contained in two pieces of proposed legislation (the </p><p>Food Law and Law on Protection of Nature).  While the </p><p>government has discarded its earlier intention to ban </p><p>the import and sale of biotech products, it feels, </p><p>probably correctly, that for any law to have chance of </p><p>passing it must follow EU\'s outline for traceability and </p><p>labeling.  In the meantime, the government and importers </p><p>appear to be maintaining an "informal" ban on GMOs, </p><p>which is costing U.S. exporters $12-$15 million a year </p><p>in lost soybean sales.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Temporary Ban Revisited </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In early May, we learned that two draft bans </p><p>on GMOs had appeared on the parliamentary agenda.  Both </p><p>drafts were submitted by political parties, not the </p><p>government.  One, a total, indefinite ban on GMOs, was </p><p>proposed by the HSP -- Croatian Party of Rights, a tiny </p><p>far-right party.  Conventional wisdom was that party\'s </p><p>marginal status would preclude the bill from getting </p><p>serious consideration.  The second bill, which called </p><p>for a total ban on the import and sale of GMOs until </p><p>legislation regulating its planting, distribution and </p><p>sale were in place, was introduced by the HSS - the </p><p>Croatian Peasants Party -- the second largest party in </p><p>the ruling coalition. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Drawing heavily upon the points used by the </p><p>embassy the first time a ban on GMOs was proposed in </p><p>Fall 2001, we urgently demarched Marijana Petir, </p><p>Spokesperson of the HSS and prominent environmental </p><p>activist (points emailed to EUR/SCE).  The HSP bill was </p><p>voted down.  The HSS bill was voted on and passed its </p><p>first reading, but was taken off of "urgent procedure" - </p><p>- which would have meant that it would have become law </p><p>immediately -- and put on the shelf awaiting a second </p><p>reading.  While this allows the HSS to have a campaign </p><p>issue, in reality the bill is unlikely to come up for a </p><p>second reading before parliamentary elections, expected </p><p>in the fall. </p><p> </p><p>We\'ll Protect You! </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Last year the government told the public that </p><p>it would, before the end of the year, pass legislation </p><p>to regulate the import and sale of GMOs.  The government </p><p>told us that it felt the need to address the concerns of </p><p>consumers, meet its obligations to bring its laws into </p><p>line with EU directives, and divert calls for an </p><p>outright ban.  A number of legislative initiatives </p><p> </p><p>dealing with consumer protection, food, and </p><p>environmental issues are under consideration and they </p><p>all touch upon GMOs in some way.  While the government </p><p>did not make its 2002 deadline for biotech legislation, </p><p>it is intent on getting these laws passed by the end of </p><p>the current legislative year, partly to make progress </p><p>with EU accession and partly to have something to show </p><p>the electorate in the Fall (the most likely time for </p><p>parliamentary elections). </p><p> </p><p>Consumer Protection Law </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Last fall, we commented on GM-labeling </p><p>requirements in the draft consumer protection law (ref </p><p>A).  Assistant Minister Spevec assured the Ambassador, </p><p>during a meeting with Minister of Economy Jurcic, that </p><p>she had reviewed the law, agreed with our assessment </p><p>that the labeling requirements went beyond even what the </p><p>EU required, and she had ordered the language be deleted </p><p>(ref B). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The legislation finally passed parliament on </p><p>June 4th.  Our preliminary review of the law indicates </p><p>that the Ministry of Economy hedged its position by </p><p>deleting all mention of "genetically modified" products. </p><p>Instead, the legislation requires manufacturers to </p><p>provide consumers with information about the existence </p><p>of "transformed" products, including transformed </p><p>ingredients and supplements, as well as the type of </p><p>transformation, in accordance with "subsequent </p><p>regulation."  It is unclear whether this is a reference </p><p>to the food law (which is generally considered to be the </p><p>main legislation on labeling), or subsequent </p><p>implementing regulations for the consumer protection </p><p>law. </p><p> </p><p>Law on Protection of Nature </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) This law has passed its first reading and is </p><p>undergoing changes in committee before getting a second </p><p>reading, probably late in June.  We are in the process </p><p>of preparing comments for the Ministry of Environment, </p><p>which is in charge of drafting the law (we have sought </p><p>input from USEU and USDA/W).  We had discussed the law </p><p>in general last fall during the visit of biotech speaker </p><p>Lisa Katic (ref c).  The draft legislation would require </p><p>licenses for the import, transport and introduction into </p><p>the environment, and placing into the market of GMO </p><p>products, principally seed.  Regulation of food and feed </p><p>is specifically deferred to the food law, and GM drugs </p><p>to a future law. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Labeling of GM seeds would be required, which </p><p>may not be an issue for the seed companies, since GM </p><p>seed usually attracts a higher price, and is a selling </p><p>point for those that wish to purchase it. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Encouragingly, GM seed imports could be </p><p>approved by a shortened procedure if there is enough </p><p>data and experience with release of the product into the </p><p>environment.  Hopefully, this would mean that products </p><p>already approved in the EU (and we would argue, in the </p><p>U.S.) would be quickly approved in Croatia as well. </p><p> </p><p>Food Law </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) We regularly raise the issue of biotechnology </p><p>in our discussions with the Ministry of Agriculture, </p><p> </p><p>including in a discussion between the Ambassador and the </p><p>Minister ref D).  When we learned that the draft law was </p><p>soon to be introduced into Parliament, we sent </p><p>preliminary comments on June 4 to the Ministries of </p><p>Agriculture (principal sponsor of the bill), Economy, </p><p>Foreign Affairs, Environment and the advisor to the </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister, and expanded comments June 16th. </p><p>The provisions of the law concerning GMO (covered as a </p><p>"novel food" in the draft) and our comments were: </p><p> </p><p>-- Special permits, issued by Ministry of Agriculture, </p><p>will be required to put GM food and feed products on </p><p>market.  The permit should be issued based on a </p><p>scientific opinion of a biotech committee in the new </p><p>food agency (the details of this committee will be </p><p>spelled out by the Minister of Health with consent of </p><p>the Minister of Agriculture in future regulations). </p><p> </p><p>US Embassy Comment: Any "committee" system should be </p><p>transparent.  It is important that non-scientific </p><p>prejudices not be allowed to block applications.  We </p><p>encourage the inclusion of industry representative on </p><p>this committee. </p><p> </p><p>-- Novel food can be banned from market entry if it is </p><p>scientifically determined to harm human health.  Novel </p><p>foods may also be temporarily banned if there is </p><p>scientific uncertainty (decision by the Ministry of </p><p>Health with consent the Ministry of Agriculture). </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Embassy Comment: We are concerned that this could </p><p>lead to the non-scientific application of the so-called </p><p>"precautionary principle" for novel foods.  There is </p><p>"scientific uncertainty" in even the most respected and </p><p>widely applied food safety rules.  The degree of risk is </p><p>what matters, not the fact that risk is present.  All </p><p>foods, additives, processes, etc., contain an element of </p><p>risk.  Why are novel foods being treated under a </p><p>separate regulatory framework?  (Please also see the WTO </p><p>SPS Agreement, Article 5, Paragraphs 1 and 2, to </p><p>determine Croatia\'s international obligations on this </p><p>point.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Novel foods will have to have a label that states </p><p>specific information that informs the consumer about </p><p>differences of novel foods comparing to standard food, </p><p>and about the process of change.  Food containing GMOs </p><p>must be labeled with "this product contains GMO."  Foods </p><p>that derive from GMOs but that do not contain GMOs must </p><p>be labeled as "this product derives from GMOs." </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Embassy Comment: We note that the proposed labeling </p><p>does not convey any health related information.  The </p><p>label will essentially be ideologically-based and will </p><p>not provide consumers with any science-based conclusions </p><p>about the product. </p><p>The labeling provisions will also be technically </p><p>impossible to enforce and will be open to fraud.  For </p><p>example, how will Croatian authorities know if soybean </p><p>oil from Brazil was made from GM soya?  There is no </p><p>reliable scientific method to test soybean oil to </p><p>determine if it has been made from GM plants.  Also, it </p><p>is unclear what the threshold level will be for </p><p>labeling. </p><p> </p><p>Labeling of all foods that are made with GM-derived </p><p>vitamin supplements, GM-derived enzymes (cheese), GM- </p><p>yeasts (beer), etc., is also not feasible and will and </p><p>result in many unintentional violations.  In many </p><p>instances, there is no scientific way of proving whether </p><p> </p><p>foods are derived from GM-plants or bacteria. </p><p>Enforcement of the law will necessarily be very </p><p>selective and aimed at imported products. </p><p> </p><p>However, we note that exempting domestic manufacturers </p><p>from labeling because they are currently widely used or </p><p>because non-GM varieties are not available (as has been </p><p>proposed recently in Parliament) could be a violation of </p><p>the WTO\'s principle of national treatment. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government believes that labeling should convey </p><p>material facts.  We are concerned that requiring </p><p>labeling when there is no material difference in the </p><p>product will lead to discrimination.  We support </p><p>voluntary labeling (such as the "organic" label used in </p><p>the United States, or "GMO-free") when the manufacturer </p><p>believes that the customer puts a premium on that </p><p>characteristic. </p><p> </p><p>-- Feed containing GMO would have to be labeled </p><p>accordingly, but details will be prescribed by the </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture. </p><p> </p><p>Embassy comment: similar to comment for food. </p><p> </p><p>-- Penalties for the violation of the law are from </p><p>100,000 to 500,000 Kn for a company and 5,000 to 10,000 </p><p>Kn for any responsible individual or employee.  (Note: </p><p>currently the exchange rate is approximately 6.5 kunas </p><p>to the dollar.) </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Embassy Comment: These are the highest penalties </p><p>contained in the draft law.  Given the fact that other </p><p>food safety issues are actually harming consumer health </p><p>in Croatia (e.g., trichinosis, lysteria, etc.) it is </p><p>interesting that other violations of the law do not </p><p>result in such strong sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) We spoke to Assistant Minister Miroslav Bozic </p><p>shortly after we sent the Ministry preliminary comments. </p><p>He said he generally agreed with our comments, except in </p><p>the areas of labeling and testing.  He believed that </p><p>consumers demand labeling, and fraud in declaration can </p><p>be prohibited.  Bozic appealed for understanding.  He </p><p>noted that Minister Pankretic (who is a member of the </p><p>HSS -- the same party that proposed a ban) has withstood </p><p>considerable pressure from his party in allowing the </p><p>food law to be drafted in a way that "opens the doors to </p><p>GMOs."  Bozic reported that he had appeared on </p><p>television the night before to defend the food law, and </p><p>had to rebut ridiculous arguments such as "why do we </p><p>need GMOs?" </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) In this conversation with A/M Bozic, we noted </p><p>that while labeling sounded reasonable in theory, in </p><p>practice, in other European countries, labeling had led </p><p>to a lessening of consumer choice, since "environmental" </p><p>NGOs had frightened grocers out of carrying GM products. </p><p>In Croatia, importers of soy products had told us that </p><p>they were not buying US soy beans, because of the fear </p><p>of being stigmatized, yet were buying Argentinean and </p><p>Brazilian soy, much of which was probably GM, despite </p><p>certificates to the contrary (see para 15). </p><p> </p><p>Media Announces Victory for GMOs </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) While the Embassy has a number of concerns </p><p>with the proposed Food Law, the press has proclaimed </p><p>that the legislation will "open the doors to GMOS." </p><p>This has caused a gnashing of teeth from the more </p><p> </p><p>strident NGOs.  A producers\' NGO, the Community of </p><p>Farmers Assembly from Slavonia and Baranja (ZUSSB), held </p><p>a press conference last week to express their shock at </p><p>Government decision to allow import of GM food.  They </p><p>invited consumers not to buy such products and even to </p><p>go a step further by "throwing" such products off the </p><p>shelves. </p><p> </p><p>But Victory not in Sight </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) Prominent environmental NGO, Zelena Acija </p><p>(a.k.a. Green Action, which is associated with the U.S. </p><p>NGO Earth First), also published a "black list," "white </p><p>list" and "green list" for foods.  The "black" list is </p><p>for companies that could not or would not certify that </p><p>they did not use or import GMOs; the "white" list is of </p><p>companies that expressed a desire to be GM-free but </p><p>could not certify all their sources; and, on the "green" </p><p>list are companies that feel they could certify their </p><p>GM-free status.  This is the second such attempt by </p><p>Zelena Acija to create such a list.  In a visit last </p><p>year to the food industry committee of the Croatian </p><p>Chamber of Economy, Zelena Akcija\'s activities were </p><p>cited as a factor in the Croatian industry\'s fear and </p><p>distrust of biotech. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)_ As mentioned above, a major food and feed </p><p>importer told us that it had stopped importing US soy </p><p>products as part of an "informal ban" on U.S. products </p><p>which could contain GMOs.  This "informal ban" was also </p><p>acknowledged by a Croatian public health official. </p><p>While the Croatian official maintained that soy imports </p><p>from Brazil (the leading source country for soya for </p><p>Croatia) were tested for GMOs in Slovenia, the Croatia </p><p>importer told us that there was no testing being done; </p><p>he and his counterparts simply requested and got "GM- </p><p>free" certificates from their suppliers. U.S. soybean </p><p>and soy meal exports to Croatia went from $12-$15 </p><p>million annually to zero today.  The decline mirrors the </p><p>adoption of GM-soybeans in the United States. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) Prominent weekly magazine Globus conducted a </p><p>poll of 600 respondents to determine the attitudes of </p><p>Croatians towards GMOs.  66 percent said they would not </p><p>accept GMOs in Croatia, and 16 percent said they would </p><p>not mind.  60 percent feared that such food would not be </p><p>properly labeled and only 15 percent said they would buy </p><p>it. </p><p> </p><p>Mission Outreach </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) The Embassy and USDA/Vienna are working </p><p>together to change those numbers, by countering the </p><p>grotesque misinformation campaign against biotech.  As </p><p>mentioned earlier, the Embassy hosted a roundtable with </p><p>a biotech speaker from the grocery industry last fall. </p><p>The speaker also visited associations and government </p><p>officials to answer often-hostile questions.  We sent a </p><p>group of four parliamentarians (two of them from the </p><p>HSS) on a biotech study tour of the U.S. in March (ref </p><p>E).  These parliamentarians, all from farm areas, came </p><p>back more inclined to believe our assurances that the </p><p>environmental and health risks of biotech are minimal. </p><p>We plan a repeat for next year, focusing on some of the </p><p>people most opposed to biotech, including the president </p><p>of Zelena Akcija. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) In February, USDA/Vienna brought in one of </p><p>the FDA\'s chief regulators, Dr. Jim Maryanski, to give a </p><p> </p><p>lecture at a biotech conference and participate in a </p><p>lunch for regulators and trade groups.  This month, </p><p>USDA/Vienna sponsored Richard Sellers from the American </p><p>Feed Industry to speak at the annual Krmiva feed show -- </p><p>the largest event of this type in the region.  Mr. </p><p>Sellers met with a number of industry representatives </p><p>and described how the U.S. feed industry has taken </p><p>advantage of the current generation of GMO crops.  The </p><p>Embassy currently seeks funding to help a local biotech </p><p>ally (the head of the Croatian Association of Bio- </p><p>geneticists and a passionate critic of "junk science") </p><p>produce a home-grown pro-biotech public information </p><p>pamphlet. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU) It is tempting to look at the headlines </p><p>decrying the "opening of Croatia to GMOs" and declare </p><p>victory.  Unfortunately, it would be illusory.  It is </p><p>difficult to see a breakthrough soon.  The chances of </p><p>Croatia passing laws that depart from EU norms on GM </p><p>labeling and licensing are negligible.  If the current </p><p>proposed laws pass, most if not all grocers and food </p><p>producers may well be afraid to source and sell biotech </p><p>products because of public perceptions and threats of </p><p>NGO protests in their stores.  And the status quo -- no </p><p>restrictions on paper yet an informal but effective </p><p>shunning of U.S. products  is hurting U.S. farm </p><p>exports. </p><p> </p><p>Rossin </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
