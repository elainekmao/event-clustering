Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (C) The situation in the east seems to have calmed </p><p>down after violence last week left at least ten Tamils </p><p>dead.  The cooling down process was given a critical </p><p>boost via an announcement by Tiger leader Prabhakaran </p><p>that he wanted the peace process to continue. </p><p>Reinforcing the positive trend, Tiger spokesman Anton </p><p>Balasingham is in Sri Lanka and on his way north to meet </p><p>Prabhakaran.  In a constructive development reflecting </p><p>an apparent easing of cohabitation stresses, the PM and </p><p>the president held a rare meeting to discuss the peace </p><p>process and other issues.  Despite the latest good news, </p><p>the situation in the east remains volatile.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>East seems calm for now </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The situation in the east seems to have calmed </p><p>down after an upsurge in tension last week left at least </p><p>ten people dead.  After seven Tamils were killed trying </p><p>to overrun a police post in Ampara District on October 9 </p><p>(see Reftel), the latest violence took place near </p><p>Trincomalee city on October 11.  In this flare-up, three </p><p>Tamil demonstrators were killed in an apparent grenade </p><p>explosion amid widespread protests by pro-Tiger elements </p><p>in reaction to the Ampara shootings.  The GSL quickly </p><p>clamped down on the situation, imposing a curfew in </p><p>Trincomalee, which was lifted over the weekend.  Tamils </p><p>also called general strikes in other parts of the north </p><p>and the east in the past several days, but there were no </p><p>additional reports of violence. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Tigers Reiterate support for Peace Track </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The cooling down process in the east was given a </p><p>key assist via an announcement by V. Prabhakaran, the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leader.  In an </p><p>October 10 statement carried on the "Voice of the </p><p>Tigers," the LTTE\'s clandestine radio station, </p><p>Prabhakaran said "we want to have peace" and </p><p>specifically added that he wanted the peace process to </p><p>continue despite the carnage in the east.  Prabhakaran\'s </p><p>statement was reiterated by Karuna, the LTTE military </p><p>leader in the Batticaloa and Ampara sectors, during a </p><p>meeting with Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) </p><p>officials on October 12.  (Note:  The SLMM has launched </p><p>an investigation into the killings in Ampara.) </p><p>Observers agreed that Prabhakaran\'s and Karuna\'s </p><p>comments were crucial in tamping down tensions in the </p><p>east.  Taranjit Sandhu, polchief of the Indian High </p><p>Commission, told us that the LTTE leaders\' "had sent the </p><p>right signals.  If they had sent the opposite signals, </p><p>the east would probably still be in turmoil." </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Balasingham Arrives </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Reinforcing the latest positive trends, Tiger </p><p>spokesman Anton Balasingham arrived in Sri Lanka on </p><p>October 15.  Upon arrival at Colombo\'s international </p><p>airport, Balasingham and his wife Adele were rushed into </p><p>a waiting Sri Lanka Air Force helicopter for a flight to </p><p>the Wanni region in northern Sri Lanka.  In this LTTE- </p><p>controlled area, Balasingham is to meet with Prabhakaran </p><p>and other senior Tiger leaders to review the peace </p><p>process in the run-up to the second round of talks </p><p>scheduled to begin later this month. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Balasingham\'s visit at this time is important as </p><p>there were concerns that last week\'s outbreak of </p><p>violence might lead to a decision by the LTTE to </p><p>postpone the trip indefinitely.  Indeed, when </p><p>Balasingham did not arrive in Colombo as planned on </p><p>October 10 these concerns skyrocketed.  The Norwegian </p><p>Embassy reports that these concerns were misplaced and </p><p>that now "all seems to be in order." (Note:  Balasingham </p><p>visited Sri Lanka earlier this year in the March-April </p><p>timeframe, but avoided travelling via Colombo.  His </p><p>stopover at Colombo\'s airport is noteworthy, as it is </p><p>his first visit to the Colombo region in almost a </p><p>decade.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>PM-President Hold Rare Meeting </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In a constructive development reflecting an </p><p>apparent easing of cohabitation stresses, the PM and the </p><p>president met on October 10.  The meeting was part of </p><p>the two sides\' recent decision to hold regular "joint" </p><p>meetings on crucial issues.  During a briefing late </p><p>October 10 involving the visiting PACOM defense </p><p>assessment team, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told the </p><p>Ambassador that his meeting with President Kumaratunga </p><p>had gone well, noting that it had gone on for about two </p><p>hours of which about half was "substantive" in nature. </p><p>The PM related that the two sides discussed defense </p><p>reforms and the peace process, among other topics.  The </p><p>two sides plan to meet again before the slated kickoff </p><p>of the second round of peace talks on October 31. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Commenting on the widely publicized meeting, </p><p>Jehan Perera, the head of a local think-tank, told us </p><p>that it was a sign that cohabitation tensions seem to </p><p>have abated a bit.  Given the long-standing differences </p><p>between the two sides, however, he did not believe the </p><p>thaw was anything but temporary.  (Note:  Perera is </p><p>probably right:  President Kumaratunga was quoted in the </p><p>press as making acerbic-tinged comments about the GSL in </p><p>public speeches over the weekend.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Despite the latest good news, the situation in </p><p>the east remains volatile.  Many contacts believe that </p><p>the LTTE is committed to saying the right things in </p><p>public, but under the surface is just waiting for a </p><p>chance to avenge the deaths of the ten Tamils.  There </p><p>may be something to that.  Along with other observers, </p><p>we have noticed an apparent increase in the LTTE\'s use </p><p>of front organizations, including youth and other </p><p>groups, to get its point across in rallies and marches. </p><p>The LTTE\'s apparent plan appears to involve turning the </p><p>heat up on the GSL, but avoid taking any blame for doing </p><p>so.  That said, Balasingham\'s visit comes at an </p><p>important juncture and seems to indicate that the </p><p>Tigers\' remain committed to talks with the government. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
