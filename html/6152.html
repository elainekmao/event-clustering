<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001446 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE (SILVERMAN AND GOELLNER-SWEET), DRL/IL </p><p>(WHITE), LABOR FOR BRUMFIELD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH LABOR: MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Turkish labor-related organizations are </p><p>focusing on IPEC and employment termination programs.  In a </p><p>climate where the GOT is seen at the very least as not </p><p>encouraging labor union activity, these organizations are </p><p>working to preserve benefits already available rather than </p><p>initiating or expanding programs.  This lack of dynamism is a </p><p>key feature of labor activity in Turkey.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Programs </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Various labor union confederations, an employer </p><p>confederation, a Turkish Ministry of Labor official and a NGO </p><p>official recently highlighted to us their participation in </p><p>IPEC (International Program to Eliminate Child Labor) and </p><p>each implied that it had played a major role in this </p><p>three-year old campaign.  In addition, under the current </p><p>Justice and Development Party (AKP) administration, the </p><p>various labor entities are participating in a committee to </p><p>review regulations regarding employment termination, an </p><p>initiative linked to concerns about privatization of Turkish </p><p>industry. </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Labor and Politics </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) While Turkish labor unions are barred from </p><p>participating in politics, often the more active, influential </p><p>union leaders serve on a variety of government-sponsored </p><p>committees and have informal connections with politicians. </p><p>Uniformly, labor union representatives assert to us that they </p><p>had not promoted particular political candidates during the </p><p>November 3 national election (which AKP won heavily).  At the </p><p>same time, they allow that an informal poll of members </p><p>probably would show that each union\'s vote would break down </p><p>along the same political lines as the overall electorate. </p><p>(Comment:  If the labor vote followed the national trend, it </p><p>would suggest there is widespread support inside Turkey for </p><p>AKP.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- HAK IS uses social democratic language to describe its </p><p>programs but is in fact the most conservative/Islamic of the </p><p>three major Turkish labor confederations.  Claiming 310,000 </p><p>members, Hak Is considers reforming the informal economy one </p><p>of its pressing issues.  Hak Is wants to assure adequate </p><p>compensation for workers and advocates social as well as </p><p>economic objectives.  According to Hak Is representatives, </p><p>while trade unions are theoretically free to advocate a </p><p>variety of ideas, the State authorities often resort to </p><p>generating "obstacles" -- including low level harassment such </p><p>as inducing sound or video system malfunctions at rallies -- </p><p>to undercut ideological messages at odds with Kemalist </p><p>propriety. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turk Is, the left of center labor confederation, advocates </p><p>expanding worker rights and believes the potential impact of </p><p>any privatization program will be injurious to Turkish </p><p>workers.  Yildirim Koc is the current advisor to Turk Is\'s </p><p>president; he was jailed for working closely with the Soviet </p><p>Union during the Communist era.  Koc asserted to us recently </p><p>that the rank and file of Turk Is is strongly antipathetic to </p><p>American initiatives.  Turk Is believes workers will be hurt </p><p>as a result of IMF restructuring programs.  Koc confirms that </p><p>while his organization has 2.5 million members on paper, </p><p>actual membership is closer to 750,000 -- still a sizable </p><p>number compared to Hak Is.  Noting that unions are permitted </p><p>in Turkey, Koc lamented that GOT tactics do not encourage </p><p>labor union organizing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkish Confederation of Employer Associations (TISK) is a </p><p>voluntary, dues-paying organization supported by 17 employer </p><p>associations, representatives of virtually every major </p><p>industry in Turkey.  TISK participates in the International </p><p>Labor Organization, International Organization of Employers, </p><p>Union of Industrial and Employers\' Confederations of Europe, </p><p>Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD.  Its </p><p>primary objective is to promote the interests of public and </p><p>private employers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Like much of Turkey, the labor organizations are in a </p><p>"wait and see" mode.  Rather than embarking on new programs, </p><p>labor organizations as a rule seldom demonstrate a knack for </p><p>innovative approaches to developing problems.  This, together </p><p>with the habitual tendency toward deference of labor and </p><p>other "NGOs" to the State authorities, indicates that the </p><p>labor "movement" in Turkey lacks the dynamism to advance </p><p>"workers\'" interests. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
