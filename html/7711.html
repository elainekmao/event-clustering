<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002758 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, NEA/NGA, PMAT; OSD FOR ISA AND ISP;JCS </p><p>FOR J5; EUCOM FOR J5, POLAD; CENTCOM FOR J5 AND POLAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ/STABILIZATION: TURKS PRESS FOR GOT </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO UK MULTINATIONAL DIVISION </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2553 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Classified by Ambassador Robert Pearson.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  During an informal breakfast meeting on April 27 </p><p>with visiting Congressman Robert Wexler (D-FL), MFA D/US </p><p>Ilkin raised the GOT\'s wish to play a role in any </p><p>stabilization force in Iraq.  Ilkin told the Congressman that </p><p>the US may have "misunderstood" Turkey\'s request to </p><p>contribute to the stabilization force, thinking that Turkey\'s </p><p>decision was contingent on external funding.  Ilkin </p><p>emphasized that Turkey wants to contribute even if it has to </p><p>pay its own way.  He went on to say that Turkish troops did </p><p>not have to be situated in the north and that the GOT would </p><p>be happy if they were assigned to Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C)  In a separate earlier conversation, Ilkin had </p><p>telephoned Ambassador on April 25 to say that the GOT had </p><p>again heard that the UK was holding a conference April 30 - </p><p>May 1 to form two multinational divisions.  Indicating </p><p>Turkey\'s interest in participating, Ilkin said the GOT had </p><p>already approached the British on this matter.  Ilkin said </p><p>Ankara was holding up its phase IV offer (including the </p><p>stabilization force) until it heard back from Washington with </p><p>regard to questions Ankara had raised about the March 26 list </p><p>of competencies that was distributed to coalition members in </p><p>Washington.  Ambassador reminded Ilkin that no neighboring </p><p>states had been invited to the UK-led multinational division </p><p>meeting and that the USG March 26 stabilization list of </p><p>competencies is a separate matter.  Ilkin then asserted that </p><p>the British could not have organized the London multinational </p><p>division meeting without US help, implying that Washington </p><p>should exert influence in attaining a Turkish role under </p><p>British command. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Following his conversation with Ilkin, Ambassador </p><p>spoke with UK Ambassador Westmacott and agreed that the </p><p>British would deal with the Turkish request on their own and </p><p>determine any appropriate Turkish participation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Congressman Wexler has not cleared this cable. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
