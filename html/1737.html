The rise of </p><p>these proto-political parties, and flirtation with them by </p><p>members of all three registered political parties, represents </p><p>the lingering resentments of those left out of the political </p><p>spoils system, and the long-standing divisions within </p><p>Nigeria\'s "big tent" parties.  Whether these new formations </p><p>win formal recognition from election authorities will </p><p>determine not only their own viability, but that of the three </p><p>existing parties as well.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dissidents Expelled </p><p>------------------- </p><p>2.  (U) On May 31, the PDP,s National Executive Committee </p><p>(NEC), sitting in Abuja, expelled five members of its Board </p><p>of Trustees, and three elected party officers.  Sunday </p><p>Awoniyi, Bamanga Tukur, Chief Edwin Ume-Ezeoke, Asheik Jarma </p><p>and Chief Don Etiebet, all senior politicians with national </p><p>recognition, and members of the PDP Board of Governors </p><p>(essentially the founding fathers of the party), had stood </p><p>accused of "anti-party activities" in a disciplinary report </p><p>assembled earlier by the Deputy National Chairman, Iro Dan </p><p>Musa.  The three party officials, National Publicity </p><p>Secretary Emmanuel Ibeshi, his deputy Gbenga Olawepo, and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Vice Chairman (South-South) Marshall Harry, also faced </p><p>"anti-party" charges not linked to the five senior </p><p>politicians.  In a later press conference, Chairman Gemade, </p><p>in announcing the expulsions, also "cautioned" prominent </p><p>northerner Abubakar Rimi and unnamed others for their "open </p><p>criticism" of the party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The expulsions come after the rise of several new </p><p>political &formations,8 (so termed as they lack, and so far </p><p>have not sought, official recognition from the Independent </p><p>National Electoral Commission as political parties).  The NEC </p><p>focused in particular on the New Frontiers group, </p><p>"coordinated" by Awoniyi and formally led by Ume-Ezeoke, to </p><p>which Jarma and Tukur had either formally pledged allegiance </p><p>or made statements and appearances on behalf of.  Etiebet was </p><p>similarly linked to the National Solidarity Association </p><p>(NSA).  These two formations draw support from prominent </p><p>politicians and retired military officers from across the </p><p>nation, but essentially have their bases in the north.  Each </p><p>has ties, at least by association, with former military Head </p><p>of State, General Ibrahim Babangida (ret.).  Many of the </p><p>announced members, particularly in the NSA, worked under </p><p>Babangida as either military governors or civilian officials. </p><p> A third new association, the Fourth Dimension Nigeria (FDN), </p><p>a collection of Abacha-era officers and politicians, has so </p><p>far gained much less attention.  These are the best known, </p><p>but not the only, political associations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pushed Before They Jumped? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>4.  (U) The expulsions appear to be a preemptive strike at </p><p>PDP dissidents long critical of party chairman Barnabas </p><p>Gemade, and long suspected of plans to split the PDP and seek </p><p>political "relevance" in new parties composed of elements of </p><p>the three existing parties.  The expulsions came at a time of </p><p>multiplying meetings, pronouncements and consultations </p><p>involving the new formations.  Reaction by those expelled </p><p>ranged from bitter to disingenuous.  Don Etiebet said in </p><p>comments to newsmen that he had been left with "no choice" </p><p>but to seek another party after unfair and illegal actions </p><p>directed at his home state PDP organization by the national </p><p>party leadership.  Sunday Awoniyi, long at odds with Gemade </p><p>after losing a bruising struggle for the PDP Chairmanship in </p><p>November 1999, pronounced himself "free at last, free at </p><p>last," from "an assembly of sinners." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) For Awoniyi in particular the expulsions in fact come </p><p>as no great surprise.  In conversation with Poloff the week </p><p>before the expulsion, he termed New Frontiers a "faction </p><p>within the PDP," but only until INEC draft legislation on </p><p>political party registration became enacted into law by the </p><p>National Assembly (the House of Representatives is now </p><p>debating the draft act).  "Then," said Awoniyi, "we move." </p><p>Awoniyi, one of the principal organizers of the Arewa </p><p>Consultative Forum, the leading Northern civic association of </p><p>traditional leaders, academics and politicians, said he hoped </p><p>to "take many people with us."  Awoniyi confirmed that New </p><p>Frontiers had been speaking to "elements" of the Alliance for </p><p>Democracy AD) and the Yoruba cultural group Afenifere, "the </p><p>younger, more progressive people," he said, as well as </p><p>political leaders in the Igbo Southeast (a geo-political </p><p>region of some weakness for the PDP of late).  He also noted </p><p>that the NSA had originally been "part" of New Frontiers, </p><p>but, anxious to exist independently of the PDP, "broke away </p><p>from us." (Awoniyi has long counseled the wisdom of remaining </p><p>within existing political structures, and avoidance of </p><p>premature launching of political groupings devoid of an </p><p>existing electoral base or reliable resources).  Reached by </p><p>Poloff June 2, Awoniyi, while noting the "illegality" of his </p><p>dismissal, said he would accept it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Abubakar Rimi, former Governor of Kano State and </p><p>leading northern progressive, meeting with Poloff the morning </p><p>after the expulsions, expressed astonishment at press reports </p><p>of his own "cautioning," and scoffed at the supposed </p><p>"unanimous" vote to expel the eight men.  Showing Poloff his </p><p>own copy of the disciplinary report he received at the NEC </p><p>meeting (the report made no mention of Rimi), he said in the </p><p>voice vote he had voted "no" emphatically, and "was not the </p><p>only one."  Rimi in recent weeks has loudly criticized PDP </p><p>leadership generally and President Obasanjo particularly. </p><p>Rimi repeated those criticisms to Poloff: "Obasanjo is </p><p>deceptive" and "lies to everyone."  Rimi claimed that "no one </p><p>said one word about me at the meeting."  Rimi agreed that </p><p>many of those found in the new formations were politicians </p><p>"who were never given a place, never rewarded for their </p><p>service to Obasanjo."  Said Rimi, "We, who founded the PDP, </p><p>who elected him, we have been ignored."  Rimi admitted that </p><p>many Northerners remained loyal to the PDP, such as Finance </p><p>Minister Adamu Ciroma, or Special Advisor Aminu Wali, "as am </p><p>I," he was careful to state, but "that doesn\'t mean we like </p><p>the direction of the government." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Employment for the Idle Rich or Stalking Horses? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>7.  (C) The NSA, and, to some degree, New Frontiers, appear </p><p>to be collections of retired Big Men, with time on their </p><p>hands and no great welcome awaiting them within the </p><p>established parties.  In discussions over the last several </p><p>weeks with various senior politicians, a typical reaction to </p><p>their formation was that of a founder and senior member of </p><p>the All People\'s Party (APP), now serving in the PDP </p><p>government.  "Look," he told Poloff, "these men don\'t want to </p><p>be fighting for contracts.  They want to be giving them out. </p><p>The only way to do that is to try to get elected.  Or sponsor </p><p>someone who is."  Colonel (ret.) Yohanna Madaki, a military </p><p>governor under IBB, now serving as the new head of the </p><p>Securities and Exchange Commission, had a slightly different </p><p>take.  He characterized many of the NSA members, particularly </p><p>the retired military men, as wealthy, but politically </p><p>irrelevant.  "They stole lots of money, and they all have big </p><p>houses in Kaduna or Abuja.  But they could not win an </p><p>election to their own local government councils."  However, </p><p>with their enormous resources, "they could be very helpful to </p><p>someone who could." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Sunday Awoniyi dismissed any suggestion of </p><p>Babangida\'s influence over the NSA, saying, "as usual, he </p><p>supposedly is backing everyone, even us (New Frontiers)." </p><p>Aminu Wali, generally agreeing that NSA consisted of wealthy </p><p>men looking for "better ways to get contracts," cautiously </p><p>allowed that Babangida "might" be behind "some" of the new </p><p>formations.  However, Colonel Madaki, speaking of the NSA\'s </p><p>recruiting tactics amongst retired military men, noted that </p><p>he had been pressed "hard" by many of his fellow retired </p><p>military governors to join the NSA.  Soon after the NSA </p><p>announced its existence, Madaki said he received a phone call </p><p>from Babangida in Minna (his home city): "Where are you?  We </p><p>need you," he reported Babangida as telling him. Whether </p><p>Babangida meant to make use of the new formation for his own </p><p>electoral plans was not so clear, said Madaki.  "He never </p><p>tells you exactly why he needs you." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New Parties to be Allowed? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>9.  (C) PDP Chairman Gemade and other officials of both the </p><p>PDP and the two other recognized parties, the APP and the AD, </p><p>publicly take no position on new political parties, or murmur </p><p>mild sentiments on the value of "more democracy." In private, </p><p>they clearly do not want to contend with new rival </p><p>organizations.  INEC, charged under the Constitution with </p><p>registering political parties and conducting elections, but </p><p>so far bereft of necessary legislation to do so (as the </p><p>Constitution also requires), awaits a finished act from the </p><p>National Assembly.  With local government elections penciled </p><p>in for April of 2002, the act must be in place for INEC to </p><p>conduct voter registration, register new parties, and receive </p><p>nominations for office.  An additional headache for INEC is </p><p>the constitutional requirement that state INECs, which do not </p><p>yet exist, run the actual elections.  If the National </p><p>Assembly delays adoption of the draft act, intentionally or </p><p>otherwise, new parties might find themselves unregistered, or </p><p>entering so late in the electoral cycle as to never quite </p><p>catch up (Ref B). INEC is now using a 1982 act, promulgated </p><p>under the 1979 Constitution, to conduct by-elections, and </p><p>could arguably use this to provisionally register new </p><p>parties, but is reluctant to do so.  INEC, formally </p><p>independent, faces at least the potential for Executive </p><p>interference in its activities, even with adequate </p><p>legislation in place (Ref B). </p><p>No Challenge to Gemade, Please </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>10 (C) Pushing Awoniyi out of the PDP, when he has, for now, </p><p>no place to turn, appears to be no accident.  Emmanuel </p><p>Ibeshi, the dismissed National Publicity Secretary, reached </p><p>by telephone June 2, told Poloff that the "real" reason for </p><p>the expulsions was to prevent any interference in PDP </p><p>convention planning (Ibeshi and the two other party officers, </p><p>who had fought with Gemade over the proper tenure of party </p><p>officers (Ref A), appear to have been punished for contesting </p><p>their earlier suspensions in court).  With the PDP scheduled </p><p>to hold its next election of leadership in November, the </p><p>absence of Awoniyi and other dissidents means Gemade will </p><p>likely face no concerted opposition to an extension of his </p><p>chairmanship.  Planning for the convention "begins now" said </p><p>Ibeshi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Awoniyi on June 2 allowed that he had been expelled </p><p>before he wished to leave.  However, he said he was "quite </p><p>confident" that the National Assembly would push through the </p><p>draft INEC legislation.  (The House of Representatives in </p><p>particular is filled with Awoniyi partisans, stemming from </p><p>Executive/National Assembly disputes of the last two years, </p><p>for Gemade took the Executive\'s side in all matters great and </p><p>small.)  While he expressed no interest in contesting party </p><p>leadership or opposing his dismissal, Awoniyi did say he had </p><p>advised "many, many" supporters within the party, </p><p>particularly elected and appointed officials "to stay inside </p><p>and wait for my call." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>12. (C) The expulsion of Awoniyi and the others represents </p><p>the triumph of a particular faction within the PDP, the PDM, </p><p>led by Vice President Atiku Abubakar, which played a leading </p><p>role in Obasanjo\'s election and which jealously protects both </p><p>Obasanjo and Abubakar from all comers.  In the words of one </p><p>member of Obasanjo\'s political kitchen cabinet: "Better to </p><p>have these men out in the open, and out of the party; they\'ve </p><p>been playing a double game."  Awoniyi, although ethnically a </p><p>middle-belt Yoruba, is a stalwart northern conservative in </p><p>outlook and association.  His departure means a sizable </p><p>segment of the northern PDP may soon depart as well.  The </p><p>recent parallel rise of several new, largely Northern </p><p>political formations also represents the aspirations of </p><p>sidelined politicians and senior retired military officers </p><p>whose efforts and experience have not, in their eyes, been </p><p>addressed or compensated by the existing political parties. </p><p>It is also an opportunity for the retired military men to </p><p>test the political climate, and gauge their acceptability </p><p>both to the political class and the Nigerian </p><p>man-in-the-street.  Ibrahim Babangida appears to be a </p><p>principal motivator, but as usual he is playing his cards </p><p>very close to his vest (some APP members, for example, are </p><p>convinced IBB will ultimately throw in his lot with them). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Comment continued.  All three existing parties face </p><p>dissident factions, and all three harbor justifiable fears of </p><p>internal discord blossoming into outright revolt, to the </p><p>benefit of their rivals, present and future (the AD already </p><p>has two distinct wings, one recognized by INEC, and one not). </p><p> Each party\'s leadership can summon up elaborate scenarios of </p><p>their own destruction at the hands of ill-intentioned </p><p>outsiders, as well as their ultimate triumph through </p><p>cannibalization of their competitors.  If additional </p><p>political parties are registered under a new INEC act, the </p><p>internal divisions of these three assemblages of powerful </p><p>personalities, largely devoid of coherent ideology or </p><p>program, will only increase.  In such a complex political </p><p>atmosphere, one additional factor will be the common use of </p><p>cold hard cash by the Presidency, political parties, and </p><p>other outsiders to influence the National Assembly.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
