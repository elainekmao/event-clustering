<p>S E C R E T SANAA 001283 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, KHDP, ASEC, PGOV, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: ADEN EXPLOSION APPEARS ACCIDENTAL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for Reason 1.5 (b, </p><p>d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary and Comment:  There are conflicting reports </p><p>on the facts behind an explosion in Aden on June 7 that </p><p>killed three Yemeni men.  However, the most credible account </p><p>of the incident from DAO staff visiting in Aden, with </p><p>corroborating facts from other sources, point to an </p><p>accidental explosion.  Differing accounts of incidents like </p><p>this one are not unusual in Yemen because the lines of </p><p>responsibility (and therefore the most accurate description </p><p>of facts) among ROYG elements are not always clear.  Post </p><p>will continue to investigate the incident to ensure no </p><p>relation to terrorism.  End Summary and Comment. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Members of the DAO who were in Aden heard the </p><p>explosion at around 12:30am on June 7 and followed up with </p><p>the Political Security Organization (PSO) and other local </p><p>contacts to ascertain the circumstances.  They were told that </p><p>three scrap-metal scalvagers recovered a unconfirmed type of </p><p>missile, possibly a small surface-to-air missile, and were </p><p>attempting to remove the metal when the missile detonated. </p><p>The three, from the same family, were killed instantly.  The </p><p>incident reportedly happened in a scrap metal yard owned by </p><p>the family in the Little Aden area. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The area around Aden contains numerous known </p><p>minefields that are undergoing clearance through the U.S. and </p><p>UNDP-supported ROYG National Mine Action Committee, but there </p><p>are still areas that contain unexploded ordinance (UXO) </p><p>outside these well-marked areas.  DAO members have observed </p><p>old missile scraps lying along the route from Aden to Little </p><p>Aden. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Local independent newspaper al-Ayyam printed the </p><p>names of the three dead.  ORCA conducted a name-check as a </p><p>precaution and came up empty. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  In another version, Ministry of Interior (MOI) </p><p>contacts told RSO that three men found an old Rocket </p><p>Propelled Granade (RPG) launcher, took it home and tried to </p><p>take it apart when it blew.  Other accounts of the facts from </p><p>various sources, including United Nations officials and the </p><p>international and Yemeni press, differ in the details.  Some </p><p>accounts mention a missile and some mention an RPG, while </p><p>some accounts mention different locations in Aden. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
