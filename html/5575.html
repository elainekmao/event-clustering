<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000263 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MASS, KPKO, NI, IV </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UWECHUE SAYS GON WILL CONSIDER </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN CDI FORCE AFTER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During a January 9 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Nigerian Special Presidential Envoy on Conflict Resolution </p><p>Ambassador Raph Uwechue discussed the evolving crisis in </p><p>Cote d\'Ivoire and the possibility of Nigerian involvement </p><p>in the ECOWAS peacekeeping force deploying to the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Uwechue said the GON was unlikely to consider </p><p>participation in the ECOWAS force until after Nigeria\'s </p><p>April presidential elections.  Uwechue added that President </p><p>Obasanjo would have more time to focus on Cote d\'Ivoire now </p><p>that he has won the PDP nomination and feels comfortable </p><p>about winning the general election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Noting that Nigeria had been noticeably "missing in </p><p>action" during much of the Ivoirien crisis and peace </p><p>negotiations, Ambassador said that even if Nigeria could </p><p>not participate in the ECOWAS peacekeeping force, it should </p><p>lend its weight to find a diplomatic and political solution </p><p>to the crisis.  Uwechue agreed whole-heartedly and asked </p><p>the Ambassador to carry this message to President Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: Subsequent to the meeting with Uwechue, </p><p>who is a seasoned and sophisticated diplomat, Ambassador </p><p>has discussed with President Obasanjo the need for greater </p><p>Nigerian diplomatic engagement on Cote d\'Ivoire.  From what </p><p>we have seen of Nigerian efforts in the past few weeks, our </p><p>entreaty seems to be paying off.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
