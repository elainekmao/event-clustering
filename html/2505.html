<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000380 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR RIEGEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: PM URGES RATIFICATION OF EMERGENCY IN SHADOW OF </p><p>ACHHAM INCIDENTS </p><p> </p><p>REF(S):  (A)  KATHMANDU 0377 (B) KATHMANDU 0379; </p><p>(C) KATHMANDU 0333 </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  Parliament reconvened in the late afternoon of Feb. </p><p>18 after angry Opposition MPs had disrupted an earlier </p><p>session, demanding Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, </p><p>rather than the Home Minister, take the podium to report </p><p>on the Maoist attacks in Achham (Ref A) the previous </p><p>day.  In his address the PM also urged ratification of </p><p>the state of emergency, allowing its continuation for </p><p>another three months.  Suggested press guidance on the </p><p>attacks in Achham follows in Para 6 below.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>PM ASKS PARLIAMENT TO RATIFY EMERGENCY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Parliamentary session interrupted mid-day Feb. </p><p>18 after angry Opposition MPs surrounded the dais and </p><p>shouted down the Home Minister (Ref B) resumed after a </p><p>five-hour delay at 5:00 p.m. the same day, with Prime </p><p>Minister Deuba, rather than the Home Minister, </p><p>addressing the assembly.  The session concluded </p><p>relatively peacefully in under two hours, although </p><p>Opposition MPs peppered the PM with questions about the </p><p>security situation in the country, according to one </p><p>member of his Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The PM began by reading out the Home Minister\'s </p><p>report on the Maoist attacks at Achham (Ref A), </p><p>reporting updated casualty figures as follows:  55 Royal </p><p>Nepal Army (RNA) soldiers (out of a 58-man platoon); 77 </p><p>policemen; 5 civilians; and 13 insurgents.  Another five </p><p>policemen were killed in a separate incident in Sarlahi </p><p>District the same day (Ref A).  In addition, Deuba </p><p>reported the Maoists stole 80 rifles, 2 shotguns, and 10 </p><p>revolvers from police at the District Police station, </p><p>jail, and airport in Achham. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The PM used the report on Achham as a lead-in to </p><p>urge ratification of the state of emergency, which would </p><p>allow its continuation for an additional three months </p><p>(Ref C).  Deuba charged that the Maoists\' bad faith in </p><p>breaking off the ceasefire after three rounds of </p><p>negotiations had left the Government of Nepal (GON) no </p><p>alternative but to seek declaration of the state of </p><p>emergency.  The three-month span of the emergency thus </p><p>far has been insufficient to quell the insurgency, Deuba </p><p>said; to do so requires more "time and patience."  The </p><p>Maoists\' actions have made them the enemy of the Nepali </p><p>people, Deuba charged; the emergency is needed to stop </p><p>the bloodshed perpetrated by the Maoists.  He </p><p>underscored that the emergency is targeted only at </p><p>Maoists, and should not adversely affect the general </p><p>population.  He added that the GON is giving ICRC access </p><p>to Maoist prisoners and allowing the organization to </p><p>scrutinize actions taken by security forces during the </p><p>course of the emergency.  The GON has received strong </p><p>moral support from the world community, Deuba noted, </p><p>including from Secretary of State Colin Powell during </p><p>his Jan. 18-19 visit to Nepal and from donors at the </p><p>Nepal Development Forum Feb. 4-7. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Deuba promised to seek all-party consensus in </p><p>pursuing needed social, economic, and administrative </p><p>reforms, including stronger legislation to curb </p><p>corruption.  Finally, he appealed to the assembled MPs </p><p>to transcend "petty interests" at this time of national </p><p>crisis and to unite in support of GON efforts to restore </p><p>security.  A vote on ratification of the emergency is </p><p>scheduled to take place Feb. 22. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>SUGGESTED PRESS GUIDANCE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Embassy proposes the following press guidance on </p><p>the incidents at Achham: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text of suggested guidance: </p><p> </p><p>The Government of the United States denounces the </p><p>violent attacks perpetrated by Maoist insurgents in </p><p>Achham District the morning of Feb. 17.  We extend our </p><p>condolences to the families of the more than 130 victims </p><p>of this senseless bloodshed.  We reiterate our support </p><p>for the right of the Government of Nepal to safeguard </p><p>its citizens, as provided for under the Constitution. </p><p>Once more we urge the Maoists to lay down their arms </p><p>immediately and to engage in the peaceful pursuit of </p><p>their aims within the democratic framework of Nepal\'s </p><p>Constitution. </p><p> </p><p>End text of suggested guidance. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
