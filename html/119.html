<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MADRID 04272 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MARR, SP, LY </p><p>SUBJECT:  SPAIN RECALLS AMBASSADOR FROM LIBYA IN </p><p>-         RESPONSE TO QADHAFI\'S THREATS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) MADRID 3838, B) MADRID 3703 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED APRIL 10 THAT </p><p>IT IS "RECALLING" ITS AMBASSADOR TO TRIPOLI FOLLOWING </p><p>QADHAFI\'S RENEWED THREAT THE DAY BEFORE TO ATTACK U.S. </p><p>FACILITIES IN SPAIN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE MFA DESK OFFICER FOR LIBYA, JOSE MARIA </p><p>VALDEMORO, TELLS US THAT AMB. PEIDRO WAS IN FACT </p><p>ALREADY HERE ON VACATION WHEN THE DECISION TO RECALL </p><p>HIM WAS TAKEN.  MFA WILL RETAIN HIM "A FEW EXTRA </p><p>DAYS" TO DRIVE HOME ITS MESSAGE.  NO DECISION HAS </p><p>BEEN TAKEN ON WHEN HE MAY RETURN TO LIBYA.  IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF LIBYAN CHARGE NAKAA, THE MINISTRY </p><p>CONVOKED THE PEOPLES\' BUREAU\'S NUMBER TWO ON APRIL </p><p>9 TO RECEIVE A PROTEST.  IN REJECTING QADHAFI\'S </p><p>THREATS, MFA NOTED THAT U.S. FACILITIES IN SPAIN ARE </p><p>GOVERNED BY A BILATERAL ACCORD WHICH WOULD PREVENT </p><p>THEIR USE AGAINST LIBYA.  THE LIBYAN DIPLOMAT RESPONDED </p><p>THAT HIS COUNTRY HAS EXPERIENCE OF U.S. BASES FROM </p><p>KING IDRIS\' DAYS; THE U.S. DID NOT ASK PERMISSION </p><p>FOR PROHIBITED MISSIONS THEN AND WOULD NOT DO SO IN </p><p>THE CASE OF SPAIN.  THE PEOPLES\' BUREAU PRESS </p><p>SPOKESMAN HAS TRIED TO DOWNPLAY QADHAFI\'S THREATS, </p><p>INSISTING THAT THEY ARE DIRECTED AGAINST AMERICAN </p><p>BASES AND NOT SPANIARDS.  THIS LINE HAS NOT PROVED </p><p>CONVINCING, HOWEVER, SINCE REPORTERS HAVE NOTED </p><p>THAT GOS FORCES SHARE THE BASES USED BY THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT.  THE TIMING OF QADHAFI\'S RENEWED </p><p>THREAT WAS SOMETHING OF A PERSONAL EMBARRASSMENT FOR </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER ORDONEZ.  THE LATTER HAD APPEARED IN </p><p>CTFGRESS THAT SAME DAY TO ANSWER AN INTERPELLATION </p><p>ABOUT THE LIBYAN MENACE TO SPAIN.  ORDONEZ REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE LIBYAN CHARGE HAD EXPRESSED REGRET OVER AN </p><p>EARLIER QADHAFI THREAT, WHICH THE CHARGE ALLEGED HAD BEEN </p><p>DISTORTED, OVERPLAYED AND TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. </p><p>THIS EPISODE HAS AGAIN DRIVEN HOME TO THE SPANISH </p><p>THAT QADHAFI IS MERCURIAL AND HIS GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ASSURANCES ARE UNRELIABLE.  THAT IS NOT TO SAY, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THE SPANISH HAVE CONCLUDED THE ONLY </p><p>WAY TO DEAL WITH QADHAFI IS TO CONFRONT HIM.  THE </p><p>PREVAILING ATTITUDE STILL SEEMS TO BE THAT IT IS </p><p>BEST NOT TO ATTRACT QADHAFI\'S ANGER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ENDERS </p><p></p></div>
