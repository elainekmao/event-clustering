<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 ANKARA 001357 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, NEA/NGA, EUR/SE, PMAT, AND L; OSD FOR ISA, ISP </p><p>AND LEGAL; JCS FOR J3, J5 AND LEGAL; EUCOM FOR J3, J4, J5, </p><p>POLAD AND LEGAL; CENTCOM FOR J3, J5 AND POLAD; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: FEB 26 SESSION: US/TU TEAMS AGREE ON TEXT FOR OPS </p><p>MOU </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 50934 B) ANKARA 1246 C) ANKARA 1270 </p><p>     D)ANKARA 1345 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(u) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) The US and TU negotiating teams reached agreement on </p><p>all of the remaining outstanding issues in the operations </p><p>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Feb 26.  After seven hours </p><p>of talks during the morning 2/26, the two sides agreed to </p><p>language on all issues but one:  fuel services-related costs. </p><p> The Turks agreed to the USG position on taxation (no taxes) </p><p>and agreed to operate under command and control arrangements </p><p>worked out in advance between US and Turkish forces if </p><p>Turkish forces engage in activities south of the Green Line </p><p>in response to a request from the US.  At approximately 1530 </p><p>that same day, the MFA informed the Embassy that the GOT side </p><p>had accepted the US team\'s counter-proposed language on fuel </p><p>services-related costs that Ambassador Pearson had presented </p><p>to U/S Ziyal at 1430 that same day (ref c).  The US continues </p><p>to hold off in responding to the TU acceptance of this </p><p>language until the remaining issues in the other two MOUs are </p><p>worked out, and until the situation becomes more clear </p><p>following Parliament\'s March 1 rejection of a motion that </p><p>would have allowed the US to deploy troops for operations </p><p>against Iraq (ref d).  The US/TU teams have nearly completed </p><p>scrubbing the more than 60-page text, and it has been </p><p>e-mailed to appropriate Washington agencies, CENTCOM and </p><p>EUCOM.   Para 10 contains the agreed upon text for the </p><p>section of the MOU (Annex C - Operations - para 7(b)) that </p><p>pertains to activities in northern Iraq.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>2/26 SESSION: BREAKTHROUGH ON OUTSTANDING ISSUES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) During seven hours of talks 2/26, the US and TU </p><p>negotiating teams reached agreement on all but one (fuel </p><p>services-related costs) of the outstanding issues in the </p><p>operations MOU identified in ref b.  Following is an </p><p>issue-by-issue summary of the agreements reached by the </p><p>parties: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>TAXES </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) The Turks agreed to the USG position on taxes. </p><p>Despite numerous unsuccessful attempts to insert the "and as </p><p>applied" language in Article IV(h) of the cover MOU, the US </p><p>side agreed to the tax relief language that is based on that </p><p>agreed to in the Site Prep MOU.  The Turks agreed to the USG </p><p>position that we not pay taxes on official expenditures. </p><p>Below is the agreed upon text for the section of the MOU </p><p>pertaining to taxes (cover MOU, Article IV, (h): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"For the sole purposes of the present MOU, defense </p><p>expenditures by or on behalf of the U.S. for the services </p><p>rendered and commodities provided to the forces of the </p><p>Sending Party in Turkey as covered by Turkish Tax Law No. </p><p>6426 dated 1954, as amended in 1992, shall be exempted from </p><p>taxes, duties, fees and charges as stipulated therein. </p><p>Regarding personal expenditures of the members of the Sending </p><p>Party forces provisionally deployed in Turkey for the </p><p>purposes of this MOU, application of other taxes, duties, and </p><p>fees in force shall not be affected, and such expenditures </p><p>shall be subject to the taxes, duties and fees relating to </p><p>purchases and services chargeable under Turkish laws and </p><p>fiscal regulations." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) While the US team conceded on this point and agreed to </p><p>delete the language in the scope on this subject, Ambassador </p><p>Lino laid down the marker that she was accepting deletion of </p><p>this phrase (and deflecting a GOT threat to revive and </p><p>present, at the last minute, a draft humanitarian assistance </p><p>annex) with the mutual understanding that combat troops have </p><p>an inherent duty to provide for assistance to civilian </p><p>populations in combat zones, insofar as it is possible. </p><p>Bolukbasi replied by stating that the subject of humanitarian </p><p>assistance had been discussed on a military-to-military basis </p><p>and whatever arrangements would be made would fall under the </p><p>aegis of Turkish legislation and regulation on the subject </p><p>(i.e., taxation).  Lino countered that she understood an </p><p>implementing arrangement would be devised to regulate the </p><p>understandings between our militaries on this question. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>NBC EQUIPMENT </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) The US delegation pressed hard to include "as </p><p>available" in the text and sought clarification that "in </p><p>Turkish territory" did not exclude northern Iraq (ref a). </p><p>The Turkish side stressed the importance they attached to </p><p>receiving NBC assets to protect the Turkish population </p><p>against a WMD attack.  The Turks wanted to try to work in </p><p>language in the MOU that would have committed us ("to the </p><p>maximum extent possible" was their wording) to provide NBC </p><p>equipment and assets to the Turkish population to protect </p><p>them against a possible attack.  The team stressed that the </p><p>US was committed to doing everything possible to defend </p><p>Turkey against a WMD attack and to helping the Turkish </p><p>population in the event of an attack, but noted that US only </p><p>had a limited supply of NBC equipment and the equipment that </p><p>would be brought into Turkey would be tied to the US forces. </p><p>In the end, the Turkish side said it understood and agreed to </p><p>accept the US language.  Following is the agreed upon text </p><p>for para 2(b) of the Operations Annex: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Sending Party may deploy Nuclear, Biological and </p><p>Chemical (NBC) assets (detection, bio-chemical), protection </p><p>(personal, collective) and decontamination into Turkey to </p><p>mitigate NBC risk in case of an Iraqi Weapons of Mass </p><p>Destruction (WMD) attack in Turkish territory. The Sending </p><p>Party will also provide NBC support, to the maximum extent </p><p>feasible, for Turkish personnel exposed to NBC contamination. </p><p>Any personnel exposed to NBC contamination should be </p><p>decontaminated at the location of the incident or at a </p><p>facility with decontamination capability." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>FUEL-SERVICES RELATED COSTS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) The Turks held firm in insisting that the US pay a </p><p>price the same as the actual cost (unspecified and "top </p><p>secret") paid by Turkish forces.  The US remained equally </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>firm on its position that we were prepared to pay the same </p><p>price for similar fuel-related services minus any taxes.  The </p><p>two sides adjourned at 1300 without having resolved the </p><p>issue.  In a follow-on meeting with U/S Ziyal, Ambassador </p><p>Pearson suggested that they agree to a concept that would </p><p>ensure that the US paid a fair and reasonable base price </p><p>(minus taxes) for fuel-related services, and provided Ziyal </p><p>compromise language that met both parties needs (ref c). </p><p>Ziyal said he would have to ask the Prime Minister, given the </p><p>large sum of money involved.  Just after the Ambassador </p><p>arrived back at the Embassy, the MFA called to say that the </p><p>GOT side had accepted our language but asked for US </p><p>confirmation that we could seal the deal on this basis.   As </p><p>of the writing of this cable (3/3), the US continues to hold </p><p>off in responding to the TU acceptance of this language until </p><p>the remaining issues in the other two MOUs are worked out, </p><p>and until the situation becomes more clear following </p><p>Parliament\'s March 1 rejection of a motion that would have </p><p>allowed the US to deploy troops for operations against Iraq </p><p>(ref d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Principles:  The US team continued to argue that we </p><p>needed language before the beginning of para 7(b) in the </p><p>operations annex (the part that discussed activities in </p><p>northern Iraq) that maintained reference to northern Iraq and </p><p>allowed us to maintain flexibility in light of the situation </p><p>on the ground (ref a).  The Turks agreed to accept some </p><p>language to this effect, but insisted that it be placed as </p><p>the second sentence at the beginning of the annex (vice </p><p>before para seven, subsection b - the US preference).  Given </p><p>the flexibility of the US position on location, the US team </p><p>agreed, but insisted that the words "in Turkey" also be </p><p>included to note that the activities discussed in the annex </p><p>were to take place in both Turkey and in northern Iraq. </p><p>Following is the agreed upon text that appears at the </p><p>beginning of Annex C of the MOU: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This Annex covers the Receiving Party and the Sending Party </p><p>relations in Turkey and in the Northern Front and sets forth </p><p>principles for activities in Turkey and in northern Iraq in </p><p>the event of operations under this MOU." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Tick 3:  Ambassador Lino deployed the compromise </p><p>language provided in ref a.  After reviewing the text, </p><p>Ambassador Bolukbasi erupted, accusing the US of trying to </p><p>limit Turkey\'s ability to fight terrorism.  He added that </p><p>fighting terrorists -- particularly PKK/KADEK -- was one of </p><p>Turkey\'s national priorities, and questioned what he </p><p>perceived to be an attempt by the US to limited Turkey\'s </p><p>ability in this area.  Lino noted that our intention was not </p><p>to limit Turkey\'s ability to combat terrorism, but rather to </p><p>clarify the language that the two sides had agreed upon ad </p><p>ref the previous night.  Bolukbasi said that if that was the </p><p>US position, there was no need to continue discussions and </p><p>started to leave.  Lino responded that it would be more </p><p>useful for the parties to continue in order to reach an </p><p>agreement as soon as possible.  Bolukbasi declined and said </p><p>he had to consult with his authorities on this matter of </p><p>national importance.  After approximately 45 minutes, during </p><p>a private meeting with Bolukbasi which she requested, Lino </p><p>reiterated that the USG appreciated the importance that </p><p>Turkey attaches to combating terrorism.  She told Bolukbasi </p><p>that in light of the importance of the issue, the USG could </p><p>agree to text that the parties had agreed to ad ref the other </p><p>evening, with a minor change.  Bolukbasi concurred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (s) Tick 4:  This was by far the most sensitive issue in </p><p>the negotiations on activities in northern Iraq and the most </p><p>difficult to resolve.  During the 2/26 morning session, the </p><p>Turkish side rejected both of the alternatives presented by </p><p>the US (ref a) as being too restrictive.  The Turkish side </p><p>then presented the US side with two sets of proposed language </p><p>-- neither of which were acceptable to the US.  After </p><p>considerable back and forth in which both sides agreed in </p><p>principle that the aim was to devise language that met both </p><p>of our needs while respecting each others\' red-lines, the </p><p>Turkish side left the room and came back nearly 30 minutes </p><p>later with language that came closer to meeting USG needs. </p><p>After some editing and refining and a small group meeting, </p><p>the US side said it could agree to the text ad ref, but said </p><p>it would have to clear it with senior US military authorities </p><p>before it could be inserted into in the MOU.  After clearing </p><p>the language with CENTCOM DCOM Gen Abazaid and JCS DJS LTG </p><p>Casey, the US team notified the Turkish team that the text </p><p>was acceptable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>AGREED UPON TEXT FOR ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) Below is the agreed upon text for para 7(b) of the </p><p>Annex C (Operations): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Activities in Northern Iraq: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(1) The Parties will be responsible for providing logistic </p><p>support along national lines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(2) All units will remain under their national command, and </p><p>all their plans, activities and objectives will be </p><p>coordinated and de-conflicted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(3) Receiving Party SOF will not be involved with any armed </p><p>engagement against Iraqi forces or any Iraqi opposition group </p><p>except in situations requiring combating terrorists, </p><p>including PKK/KADEK, or the exercise of the right of </p><p>self-defense or in circumstances enshrined in paragraph (4) </p><p>below. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(4) Armed conflict between Iraqi  opposition groups or </p><p>attempts by them to cross the Green Line (de facto line as </p><p>depicted in Appendix-4) shall be closely monitored by Sending </p><p>Party forces and the Parties will exchange necessary </p><p>information on opposition group activity across the Green </p><p>Line in a timely manner. Close coordination shall be </p><p>maintained for any follow up action when required in such </p><p>emergency situations involving hostile activities contrary to </p><p>the principles in this section of the MOU that should be </p><p>repelled in accordance with mutual commitments enshrined in </p><p>paragraph (5) below. In such cases where either Party </p><p>believes a violation of these principles is occurring or is </p><p>about to occur, that Party shall promptly notify the other </p><p>Party. In cases where the Sending Party concludes that it may </p><p>not be able to prevent such hostile activities in a timely </p><p>manner, it may approach the Receiving Party authorities for </p><p>assistance as required under these circumstances. Receiving </p><p>Party authorities shall evaluate the situation and any </p><p>follow-up action that may be required under the circumstances </p><p>shall be considered and decided jointly by the Sending Party </p><p>and the Receiving Party, including the necessary arrangements </p><p>that shall establish tactical and operational requirements in </p><p>the area for the security of the respective units. Execution </p><p>of any follow-up action will be based upon the agreed </p><p>arrangements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(5) Operations to ensure security and safety of all Iraqi </p><p>opposition groups would be a Sending Party responsibility, </p><p>but the Sending Party shall coordinate this mission with the </p><p>Receiving Party, as it does in other areas. None of the </p><p>groups shall be allowed to use force or engage in hostile </p><p>activities against each other. When JSOTF-N needs to make </p><p>coordination or contact with the Turkoman, they will approach </p><p>Receiving Party SOF to make that coordination and contact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(6) Representatives of the Receiving Party will be allowed to </p><p>be present at planning meetings of the Sending Party with the </p><p>PUK and KDP groups concerning training, organization and </p><p>provision of weapons and equipment by the Sending Party. </p><p>Support to these groups (training, organization and </p><p>distribution of weapons and equipment) will be coordinated in </p><p>a timely manner with the Receiving Party authorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(7) Provision of weapons and equipment shall be commensurate </p><p>with the needs of self-defense and execution of the missions </p><p>to be assigned to these groups. No heavy weapons shall be </p><p>provided and all weapons distributed for these purposes shall </p><p>be registered  with a view to ensure their return at the end </p><p>of the operations. Receiving Party LNOs may observe the </p><p>entire process from registration to distribution and be </p><p>provided copies of the registration forms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(8) The PUK and KDP settled north of the Green Line will be </p><p>trained and organized with a purpose of defeating Iraqi </p><p>forces when serving with Sending Party SOF.  All such </p><p>training and organizing by the Sending Party SOF with PUK, </p><p>KDP and other groups may be observed upon request by assigned </p><p>Receiving Party SOF LNOs. Receiving Party SOF LNOs will </p><p>request to observe training to the respective Sending Party </p><p>Operational Detachment Bravo (ODB) commanding officer. All </p><p>military operations south of the Green Line by Sending Party </p><p>trained and organized Kurdish elements will be under Sending </p><p>Party command and control. The Sending Party undertakes to </p><p>provide timely information in advance to the Receiving Party </p><p>in this respect for the purpose of coordination with the </p><p>Receiving Party SOF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(9) The officers assigned to the JCC (Diyarbakr) and, if </p><p>requested, Silopi, shall carry their own pistols. </p><p>Accommodations and messing for these officers shall be met by </p><p>their respective commands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(10) During an emergency (casualty evacuation, medical </p><p>evacuation, or WMD attack), either Party,s communications </p><p>systems can be used to assist in resolving the emergency and </p><p>saving lives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(11) Receiving Party and Sending Party SOF units in northern </p><p>Iraq deployed to the same areas will have separate HQ </p><p>locations, but may provide 2-5 liaison officers at the </p><p>battalion and company level. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(12) The Sending Party will provide timely information on </p><p>Turkish citizens in the custody of Sending Party forces in </p><p>northern Iraq. The Sending Party will make those Turkish </p><p>citizens available to Turkish authorities and, when requested </p><p>by the latter, necessary arrangements will be made </p><p>expeditiously for their joint interrogation and debriefing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) This message has been cleared by Ambassador Lino and </p><p>EUCOM J5 Maj. Gen Kohler. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
