<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 002567 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/W AND AF/EPS </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO PASS AID/WASHDC </p><p>AID FOR AFR/AA AND AFR/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, EINV, ECPS, ENRG, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA\'S PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM: STATUS </p><p>REPORT </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Introduction and Overview </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>l. (U) Nigeria\'s National Privatization Program is </p><p>being carried out by the National Council for </p><p>Privatization (NCP), and is implementing arm, the </p><p>Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE). In phase one of the </p><p>program, which ended in 2001, the BPE offered its own </p><p>shares to the public in three banks, two cement, and </p><p>five petroleum marketing enterprises </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Phase two started later in 2001 with the </p><p>preparation of several major enterprises for sale. The </p><p>controlling interest in Nigerdock, Nigeria\'s premier </p><p>shipbuilding and offshore construction yard, was </p><p>auctioned in November 2001. However, the winning </p><p>bidders were unable to sustain their partnership </p><p>agreement, and one of the buyers, an U.S. company, has </p><p>withdrawn. NITEL, the state-owned telephone and </p><p>telecommunications monopoly, was awarded to the </p><p>highest qualified bidder in September 2001, but the </p><p>winning core investors were unable to raise the </p><p>necessary capital to honor their commitment to </p><p>purchase 5.1% of NITEL. Details on the NITEL and </p><p>Nigerdock transactions will follow. However, Festac </p><p>77, a large hotel in Lagos, was successfully </p><p>privatized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Currently, there are over 60 public </p><p>enterprises designated for privatization, including </p><p>flagship state-owned monopolies such as </p><p>telecommunication (NITEL), electricity (NEPA), post, </p><p>port services, railways, the petroleum refineries, and </p><p>the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) </p><p>subsidiaries.  The workload of this latter series of </p><p>transactions is enormous in terms of preparation, </p><p>professional expertise, preparation of the companies, </p><p>the due diligence process, the review and analysis of </p><p>submitted bids, and the negotiation and closing of </p><p>transactions. Progress made with the many enterprises </p><p>awaiting privatization demonstrates the Executive </p><p>branch\'s political will to advance privatization and </p><p>the improved technical expertise of the BPE </p><p>professional staff in shepherding complex </p><p>privatization exercises. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Nonetheless, privatization remains a </p><p>controversial move in Nigeria. Among the general </p><p>public and even within government, particularly the </p><p>National Assembly, support is neither particularly </p><p>wide nor deep. Some fear privatization is a ruse </p><p>whereby cronies of the Administration are allowed to </p><p>purchase government assets at discount rates. Others </p><p>are apprehensive privatization will result in the loss </p><p>of significant portions of the Nigerian patrimony to </p><p>greedy foreigners. Still others question whether </p><p>privatization will bring significant benefit given </p><p>other growth-adverse dysfunctions in the economy that </p><p>privatization cannot address. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Privatization is viewed cautiously by senior </p><p>government officials jealous of their control over </p><p>parastatals and by employees who think privatization </p><p>as synonymous with workforce reduction. Labor unions, </p><p>especially, are opposed to privatization in almost </p><p>every sector. Because of this lack of consensus, each </p><p>sale faces strong opposition. Every successful sale </p><p>will generate additional support and reduce the </p><p>decibels of privatization\'s critics. However, when </p><p>sales fall through, even due to circumstances beyond </p><p>the control of BPE, as with the NITEL and Nigerdock </p><p>bids, the proficiency of BPE and utility of </p><p>privatization will be attacked.  In short, despite the </p><p>BPE\'s improved capacity and ambitious schedule, </p><p>Nigerians will remain divided over privatization until </p><p>they see some material benefit. End Introduction and </p><p>Overview. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>BPE and USAID </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) USAID has provided assistance to the BPE since </p><p>May 2000, and the Mission expects to continue its </p><p>support until November 2002. The primary objective of </p><p>the USAID-funded project is to provide technical </p><p>assistance and training to the BPE. USAID\'s assistance </p><p>has greatly strengthened BPE\'s institutional and </p><p>professional capabilities and has enabled the </p><p>Director-General to transform BPE into an institution </p><p>that can carry out transactions in a professional, </p><p>transparent manner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) USAID-funded assistance has been instrumental </p><p>in moving the privatization process forward. BPE has </p><p>made progress in public offers and core investor </p><p>sales, as well as in due diligence work in the form of </p><p>"diagnostic reviews". The importance and early </p><p>progress in privatization made by BPE and the </p><p>transparency of its procedures led to a $114 million </p><p>low interest loan from the World Bank to support </p><p>Nigeria\'s privatization effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) In addition to privatization transactions, the </p><p>BPE is helping to develop the legal and institutional </p><p>infrastructure needed to insure that newly privatized </p><p>firms will operate under more competitive market </p><p>structures.  BPE is also working on other appropriate </p><p>institutional arrangements that will improve the </p><p>efficiency of resource use and aid in Nigeria\'s </p><p>economic growth. For example, USAID-funded expatriate </p><p>advisors and the core team are working in such areas </p><p>as privatization procedures and methods, domestic and </p><p>international procurement processes, public awareness, </p><p>labor policies, environmental issues, anti-trust </p><p>legislation and regulation, pension reform, and legal </p><p>and policy reform leading to the eventual </p><p>establishment of regulators for electricity, </p><p>telecommunications, and transport (Air, Rail and </p><p>Ports). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Notwithstanding the progress made, the Director </p><p>General of BPE recently decided accelerating the pace </p><p>of privatization, required steps to increase the level </p><p>of accountability within the organization. On July 1, </p><p>he re-organized the Bureau into six Departments, each </p><p>responsible for the privatization of enterprises in a </p><p>given sector of the economy. It is expected that the </p><p>result will be a fairly marked increase in the number </p><p>of public enterprises privatized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The latest internal plans for BPE call for </p><p>over 20 enterprises to be privatized by the end of </p><p>2002; it is anticipated that more than 30 will be </p><p>privatized in 2003.  Following is a synopsis and </p><p>evaluation of the major privatizations carried out by </p><p>the BPE so far, and the conclusions we have drawn from </p><p>their performance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Telecommunications (NITEL) </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The privatization of NITEL is widely viewed as </p><p>unsuccessful because the sale was not consummated. </p><p>However, the technical privatization was </p><p>professionally managed. The failure was mostly due to </p><p>three factors: the financial downturn in the world </p><p>telecommunications industry, which prevented major </p><p>international bidders from participating,; the lack of </p><p>new regulatory legislation for the telecommunications </p><p>sector, which has been under review in the National </p><p>Assembly for a year; and the inability of the winning </p><p>bidder to secure from financial markets the $1.38 </p><p>billion purchase price their group had committed for </p><p>51 percent of NITEL.  The Chief of Party of the USAID </p><p>project providing technical support to BPE concluded </p><p>that with respect to transparency and efficiency of </p><p>the privatization process, the privatization of NITEL </p><p>was a major success. The procedures followed the </p><p>criteria used for selection were publicly advertised </p><p>domestically and internationally and were well </p><p>understood by all participants. Documentation </p><p>requirements were set forth clearly, establishing a </p><p>technical threshold that prospective bidders had to </p><p>satisfy in order to be pre-qualified to bid.  The pre- </p><p>qualified investors submitted technical and financial </p><p>proposals for review pursuant to selection criteria </p><p>which were established and made known well in advance, </p><p>so that no accusations of favoritism or corruption </p><p>could be leveled at the BPE. Review of the technical </p><p>proposals adhered to the highest standards acceptable </p><p>in the investment banking profession. The legal and </p><p>procedural requirements for bidding were very clearly </p><p>and publicly stated and the bid opening was accessible </p><p>to the public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) It is not unusual for privatization </p><p>transactions to fail to close, often due to the </p><p>inability of a winning bidder to raise sufficient </p><p>capital to close the deal. Despite the setback, BPE </p><p>has not surrendered on privatizing NITEL. Next steps </p><p>in the NITEL privatization process will be to offer </p><p>about l5 percent of the shares to the public in an </p><p>Initial Public Offering (IPO) before the end of 2002. </p><p>A professional management contractor is being </p><p>recruited to run NITEL on an interim basis until the </p><p>global telecom market returns to financial health, at </p><p>which time a core investor will again be sought. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>NIGERDOCK </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) The core investor sale of Nigerdock was </p><p>successfully concluded with the execution of a Share </p><p>Sale/Purchase Agreement concluded December 20, 2001 </p><p>with Global Energy Company (GEC), the successful core </p><p>investor.  As part of the terms of the Agreement, a </p><p>minimum of 25% of the core investor shares was to have </p><p>been sold to Houston-based J. Ray McDermott Inc. </p><p>(JRM), a U.S. firm and the foreign technical partner </p><p>to GEC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) A separate Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) </p><p>was executed by GEC and JRM and a transitional period </p><p>of six months commenced in January 2002.  Recently, </p><p>however, J. Ray McDermott withdrew from Nigerdock </p><p>claiming that Global Energy did not abide by the </p><p>Agreement between them. GEC has taken the case to </p><p>court and is currently seeking a new technical partner </p><p>to replace JRM. The BPE intends to sell 29% of its </p><p>remaining 49% in Nigerdock in an Initial Public </p><p>Offering (IPO). It is planned that the issue will </p><p>close by the end of 2002 with shares being distributed </p><p>early in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Electricity (NEPA) </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The reform program for the power sector </p><p>comprises preparation and adoption of a new </p><p>electricity law; creation of a power sector regulatory </p><p>agency; creation and operation of a new Electricity </p><p>Supply Industry including the unbundling of the state- </p><p>owned national electric supply utility, NEPA, into </p><p>separate generation, transmission and distribution </p><p>entities; privatization of multiple generation and </p><p>distribution units as separate limited liability </p><p>companies; and, finally, creation of a fund and an </p><p>agency to focus on rural energy and assistance to </p><p>consumers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) Currently, the BPE is at the closing stages of </p><p>hiring consultants to undertake these tasks. The </p><p>preferred consultants include Credit Suisse First </p><p>Boston and the Spanish/Latin American firm, Mereados </p><p>Energeticos. At this point, the corporate </p><p>restructuring blueprint has been prepared and </p><p>preparations for implementation are being made. Also, </p><p>the lobbying of the National Assembly to pass the </p><p>Electric Power Sector Reform Bill has been </p><p>intensified. This is being done along with an enhanced </p><p>public communications campaign that includes the use </p><p>of various media to win the support of the Nigerian </p><p>public and road shows to report on reform efforts and </p><p>secure the long-term interest of foreign investors and </p><p>operators. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) By the end of 2002, it is expected that the </p><p>following would have been completed with respect to </p><p>NEPA: the establishment of 18 new legal/physical </p><p>business units and a special purpose entity (to take </p><p>over and pay off NEPA\'s stranded liabilities); </p><p>drafting of market rules for the transition stage; a </p><p>comprehensive due diligence audit of NEPA; substantial </p><p>completion of the physical establishment of the </p><p>regulatory agency and the hiring of executive and </p><p>senior staff, and a Draft Rural Energy Policy and the </p><p>setting up of the Rural Energy and Consumer Assistance </p><p>Funds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) Although challenging, it is anticipated that </p><p>BPE will be able to achieve these objectives and will </p><p>then be in a position to complete the restructuring </p><p>process and commence the privatization of the </p><p>resulting distribution and generation enterprises, </p><p>most of which may well be completed by the end of </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Hotels </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) The Nicon Hilton (NIRMSCO) and the Sheraton </p><p>(Capital Hotels Plc) Hotels are in the very final </p><p>stages of privatization with respect to the </p><p>controlling interest. For offer is 51% of each, with </p><p>the balance to be sold to the public through IPO\'s. </p><p>Potential investors have applied, been short-listed, </p><p>performed due diligence, submitted technical proposals </p><p>and financial bids and have had their technical </p><p>proposals assessed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) The next step, the public opening of the bids, </p><p>was completed on August 14, and African Properties </p><p>Nigeria, Ltd.\'s (led by Co-investor Southern Sun </p><p>Hotels of South Africa) bid of $ 62 million for the </p><p>Nicon Hilton and Hans Gremlin Nigeria, Ltd.\'s bid of $ </p><p>32 million for the Sheraton were declared the winners. </p><p>Therefore, both privatizations are at the final stage, </p><p>awaiting closing of the sale. One lingering problem </p><p>with the Hilton has been the union\'s insistence that a </p><p>new collective agreement should be negotiated prior to </p><p>the sale. This is opposed by the BPE which insisted </p><p>from the beginning that a new agreement must be signed </p><p>with the new owner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) Amid the up-and-downs of the first two years </p><p>of Nigeria\'s privatization program, the emergence of </p><p>BPE as an effective privatization organization is </p><p>significant. Any privatization program needs to have a </p><p>strong and credible system put into place in order to </p><p>be effective. The prospective investors, particularly </p><p>international investors, require such procedures in </p><p>order to review any potential purchases, or </p><p>to even start the expensive and time-consuming due </p><p>diligence process. In a country where corruption is </p><p>common, Nigeria\'s privatization program needed this </p><p>kind of operational and procedural credibility to </p><p>demonstrate its commitment to privatization, and to </p><p>attract prospective investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) The BPE appears committed to ensuring </p><p>transparency and is following recently established </p><p>procurement and privatization procedures that meet </p><p>world standards. These procedures govern the selection </p><p>of advisors, potential investors and winning bidders. </p><p>The transaction process itself is clearly laid out in </p><p>writing, with criteria available to the public, as </p><p>well as to prospective advisers and investors. BPE has </p><p>cause to assert that it runs a privatization program </p><p>that can withstand the scrutiny of any investor or </p><p>arbiter of standards, procedures, and effectiveness. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) Still, while privatization is one of </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s top economic reform priorities </p><p>and BPE has actively pursued it, there is significant </p><p>political opposition. Privatization is not viewed as </p><p>an unalloyed benefit by many Nigerians, even within </p><p>government. After years of military rule, many people </p><p>have statist mindsets and look warily at private </p><p>sector control over key industries and utilities. Even </p><p>among those favoring privatization, the GON program </p><p>has its critics. Some complain the program is moving </p><p>too fast, selling the wrong companies at the wrong </p><p>time, such as with NITEL when the sale took place </p><p>after world telecom prices had plummeted. These </p><p>critics say that lauding the technical correctness of </p><p>a sale offers little comfort when the sale comes at a </p><p>bad time economically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) While the honesty of the actual bid process </p><p>may not be hotly disputed, some observers challenge </p><p>the selection of enterprises that are being </p><p>privatized.  BPE has been accused of rushing the sale </p><p>of the National Mint because a close relative of </p><p>President Obasanjo, in concert with relatives of </p><p>Kenyan President Moi, may be interested in the </p><p>purchase. Some people also fear that privatization of </p><p>the larger parastatals is being rushed in order to </p><p>maximize revenues while it would have been more </p><p>prudent to follow a more deliberate sequencing that </p><p>moved from smaller to large firms, and an even more </p><p>measured approach to "national interest" companies </p><p>such as NITEL and NEPA. Another profound question is </p><p>whether privatization is outpacing other reform </p><p>efforts. Without sufficient reform in other areas, the </p><p>enabling environment may be insufficient. It is feared </p><p>that all privatization may accomplish is to turn a </p><p>moribund state company into an equally inefficient </p><p>private concern. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (U) In the end, Nigerians will judge the utility </p><p>of privatization by whether the exercise results in </p><p>better performance and a more vibrant economy. As much </p><p>as possible, we need to continue working with the BPE </p><p>to further enhance its work and to help Nigeria see </p><p>that privatization is not just an abstraction, nor a </p><p>ploy for foreign control of the economy, but that it </p><p>provides real economic benefit, to the Nigerian </p><p>people. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
