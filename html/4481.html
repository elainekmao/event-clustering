SUMMARY: The impact of the Maoist insurgency has </p><p>not been limited to Nepal\'s national parks and </p><p>conservation areas (septel).  The assault on the </p><p>country\'s wildlife has been accompanied by a plundering </p><p>of forest and other plant resources.  Biodiversity </p><p>resources of global significance are threatened. </p><p>Nepal\'s community forestry programs, a model for the </p><p>rest of South Asia, are reeling from the climate of </p><p>insecurity.   The conflict is contributing to migration </p><p>away from food-insecure areas and hollowing out the </p><p>rural economy.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>ILLEGAL LOGGING AND PLUNDER OF FOREST RESOURCES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Department of Forests recently reported that </p><p>insurgents have destroyed 40 out of 92 area forest </p><p>offices in the country.  Similarly, 190 out of the 696 </p><p>range posts have been destroyed.  This accelerating </p><p>trend threatens to raise the rate of deforestation in </p><p>Nepal beyond current estimates of 1.7 percent per year. </p><p>Large-scale damage to this resource base could have </p><p>serious repercussions on Nepal\'s fragile watersheds as </p><p>well. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Reports indicate that illegal logging and other </p><p>criminal activities have increased as local people are </p><p>forced to find ways to make ends meet.   Visitors and </p><p>journalists who have dared to travel to such northern </p><p>outposts of Nepal as Humla and Gorkha report that as a </p><p>result of both the growing security vacuum and falling </p><p>numbers of tourists, locals are resorting to illegal </p><p>timber harvesting, smuggling lumber across the border </p><p>to Tibet.  Since coniferous trees in these high </p><p>altitude areas grow slowly, the loss will be nearly </p><p>irreparable. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Not only Nepal\'s megafauna, but also plants are at </p><p>risk.  Valuable species (some rare), such as medicinal </p><p>herbs, are being overharvested for quick profit, either </p><p>by villagers or the Maoists.  If unchecked, this could </p><p>bring extinction to certain species of global </p><p>biodiversity significance.  Further, in Chitwan and </p><p>other parks, ecosystems are at risk because the </p><p>security vacuum allows people illegally to bring </p><p>livestock in to graze. </p><p> </p><p>COMMUNITY FORESTRY TAKES A HIT </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  Community forestry has been another victim of the </p><p>insurgency.  Nepal has more than 11,500 forest user </p><p>groups in nearly all of its 75 districts, with </p><p>participation by about 1.2 million households, and has </p><p>been lauded internationally for its exemplary success </p><p>in reclaiming denuded hillsides through community </p><p>forestry efforts.  Years of painstaking effort by local </p><p>communities in partnership with the Nepalese government </p><p>and donors such as USAID, DANIDA, and DFID have </p><p>resulted almost 9,000 square kilometers of forests </p><p>being turned over to community management -- about 50 </p><p>percent larger than the total forest cover of national </p><p>parks and protected forests. </p><p> </p><p>6.  But now many of these community forests are going </p><p>unmanaged and are practically abandoned.  Villagers, </p><p>caught in the crossfire between Maoist insurgents and </p><p>army patrols, are sta </p><p>ying out of their own forests, </p><p>unable to either harvest the forest products required </p><p>for their daily subsistence or protect their resources </p><p>and conduct remedial forestry activities. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The diversion of government revenues from the </p><p>forestry and other sectors into the fight against </p><p>terrorism has caused serious hardship to forest </p><p>officials and rural people alike. The department budget </p><p>has been cut significantly this year.  In addition, </p><p>donor-funded projects have either been terminated or </p><p>limited to more secure areas, such as district </p><p>headquarters.  Many local community forest groups are </p><p>denied services for saplings, seedlings, technical </p><p>expertise and other needed inputs. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The insurgency is indirectly responsible for other </p><p>pressures on community forests.  An increasingly cash- </p><p>strapped government is starting to look particularly at </p><p>the valuable hardwoods in the Terai as a potential </p><p>source of income.  Some officials question whether </p><p>community forestry is actually the right approach, </p><p>calling instead for joint management of forests between </p><p>the user groups and the government.  The incentive: the </p><p>royalties that could be tapped by exporting lumber to </p><p>nearby India. (Note: this would be similar to the </p><p>strategy used by India, which has been considerably </p><p>less successful than Nepal in protecting forest </p><p>resources). </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  The vast majority of Nepal\'s people still </p><p>lives in rural areas and relies on agriculture for </p><p>livelihoods.  People depend tremendously on forest </p><p>resources for energy and other daily needs such as </p><p>animal fodder, medicinal plants, and building </p><p>materials.  The degradation of their forests threatens </p><p>to break the back of the rural economy and will lead to </p><p>greater food insecurity.  This can only result in </p><p>increased migration.  The emptying-out of Nepal\'s rural </p><p>areas, especially of younger, economically active </p><p>people, is accelerating, with famine becoming an ever </p><p>more likely prospect for Nepal\'s more remote areas, </p><p>such as the far west.  Septel will address food </p><p>security issues in more detail. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p> </p><p>                   . </p><p></p></div>
