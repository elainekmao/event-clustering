<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000873 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF/W AND INL/AAE - E.FLOOD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, SNAR, PGOV, KDEM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: RIOT CONTROL EQUIPMENT PRESENTATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. During an April 8 turnover ceremony, Ambassador </p><p>Jeter presented the Inspector General of Police (IGP), </p><p>Tafa Balogun, with riot control and other equipment </p><p>valued at more than $300,000.  The donation, part of </p><p>the ICITAP Civil Disorder Police Reform Training </p><p>Program, included helmets, shields, batons, handcuffs </p><p>and other items.  Jeter commended the participants and </p><p>others involved in making the training possible and </p><p>challenged the NPF to make Nigeria proud by utilizing </p><p>the training they received in a professional, </p><p>responsible and non-partisan manner during the </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The IGP thanked the Ambassador and the </p><p>American Government for the contribution and for being </p><p>an active training partner of the NPF.  He applauded </p><p>the excellent relationship between the U.S. and </p><p>Nigeria and remarked that the best way for the NPF to </p><p>reciprocate was to demonstrate their professionalism. </p><p>The IGP remarked that he was a believer in the "train </p><p>the trainer" concept as he himself had been a </p><p>recipient and later a trainer for six years of his </p><p>career. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The IGP\'s comments indicate that Balogun may </p><p>have become a committed convert to the benefits of </p><p>bilateral cooperation on law enforcement.  When he </p><p>ascended to his current position last year, Balogun </p><p>was not an enthusiastic supporter of our police </p><p>training efforts.  However, Balogun now appears to </p><p>have made a welcomed about face.  In his remarks </p><p>Balogun reiterated his eight-point strategy for law </p><p>enforcement that included training as a major element </p><p>and assured the Ambassador of his continued </p><p>cooperation.  The IGP also expressed his gratitude to </p><p>the LAPD for the donation of the protective vests made </p><p>possible through the efforts of Los Angeles Police </p><p>Capt Patrick Findley adding this was "just the </p><p>beginning" of the level of cooperation expected </p><p>between the U.S. and Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
