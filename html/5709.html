(U) SUMMARY:  Vietnamese provincial drug treatment </p><p>centers range from the most basic to relatively modern. </p><p>Most suffer from a lack of physical and material resources. </p><p>The addict population is a combination of those who enter </p><p>voluntarily and others who are undergoing "compulsory" </p><p>treatment.  While the GVN appears committed to helping </p><p>addicts, treatment and vocational training specified under </p><p>the law and relevant regulations are often lacking due to </p><p>budget constraints.  Insufficient professionally trained </p><p>staff also appears to be a systemic problem.  During 2002, </p><p>there were a number of well-publicized escapes from </p><p>provincial centers.  Septel will discuss community-based </p><p>drug treatment.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>NATIONAL POLICY FRAMEWORK </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The GVN recognizes drug addiction as a serious </p><p>problem.  The "official" number of addicts of all kinds, </p><p>according to the GVN, is 142,000 people.  (Note:  Most </p><p>experts view this as significantly understated. End note.) </p><p>Even according to official figures, the number has risen </p><p>over 40 percent in the past two years.  To address the </p><p>problem, Vietnam has a network of drug treatment centers. </p><p>According to the Standing Office of Drug Control (SODC), </p><p>there are 73 centers at the provincial level, which have a </p><p>capacity of between 50 to 3,000 addicts each.  Provincial </p><p>authorities support most centers, but some are supported by </p><p>mass organizations, such as the Youth Union. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The "National Law on Drug Prevention and </p><p>Suppression," passed by the National Assembly in 2000, </p><p>established the broad policy for drug treatment in its </p><p>Chapter Four.  The law, while relatively general, notes that </p><p>the "State encourages voluntary treatment" but recognizes </p><p>the need for "compulsory detoxification centers."  Nguyen </p><p>Hoang Mai, senior expert of the National Assembly\'s (NA) </p><p>Social Affairs Committee, claimed that the NA never intended </p><p>to pass a law that would describe drug treatment "in </p><p>detail."  He asserted that, as with other "general laws," </p><p>implementation details would follow in the form of separate </p><p>administrative decrees and circulars. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Since the law\'s passage, the GVN has indeed issued </p><p>additional directives pertaining to drug treatment. </p><p>According to Dr. Tran Xuan Sac, Director of National Policy </p><p>and Planning in the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social </p><p>Affairs\' (MOLISA) Department of Social Evils Prevention, by </p><p>issuing Decision 150 in late 2000, the GVN settled a "long- </p><p>standing disagreement" between MOLISA and the Ministry of </p><p>Health (MOH) over drug treatment.  Under this Decision, the </p><p>GVN designated MOLISA as responsible for organizing and </p><p>managing drug treatment and MOH as responsible for medical </p><p>treatment in the centers.  In March 2002, the GVN issued </p><p>Decree 34, which lengthened mandatory stays in provincial </p><p>drug treatment centers for "hard drug" addicts to two years, </p><p>up from the previous minimum of six months to one year, </p><p>depending on the type of addiction (ref A).  Decision 605, </p><p>signed by MOLISA Minister Nguyen Thi Hang in June 2002, </p><p>required MOLISA staff to develop a plan on how to provide </p><p>treatment to all registered addicts and to reduce the </p><p>relapse rate to 60 percent, down from the probable 90-95 </p><p>percent current range (similar to other countries). </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  Concerning treatment procedures, Interministerial </p><p>Circular 31, issued in December 1999, specified a series of </p><p>five steps for treatment, including (1) reception and </p><p>classification; (2) detoxification; (3) education; (4) work </p><p>and preparation for reintegration into society; and, (5) </p><p>community-based long-term management.  Circular 31 also </p><p>directed drug treatment centers to develop vocational </p><p>training with the goal of providing recovering addicts with </p><p>"basic skills." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Interministerial Circular 05, issued in February </p><p>2002, updated Circular 31 and added more specifics on the </p><p>centers.  According to the Circular, centers must: </p><p>--receive drug addicts (and prostitutes, who are to be </p><p>segregated within the complex) and provide a "safe </p><p>environment" for treatment; </p><p>--organize and provide treatment, rehabilitation, </p><p>counseling, vocational training (either in-house or by </p><p>outside contractors), and productive labor; </p><p>--create opportunities within the center for putting </p><p>vocational training skills into practice (Note:  At Hanoi </p><p>Center number 6, run by and for Hanoi People\'s Committee but </p><p>located in nearby Ha Tay province, recovering addicts </p><p>working in the tailoring shop received "small amounts of </p><p>money" for their labor, according to center director Dr. Le </p><p>Duy Luan.  Proceeds from their products also were applied to </p><p>buying items for the center library, he added.  End note.); </p><p>--provide remedial education for illiterate addicts; and, </p><p>--facilitate the addicts\' reintegration into society. </p><p> </p><p>The circular also stipulated that centers: </p><p>-- should have trained personnel in areas including </p><p>medicine, vocational training, education, and security; and, </p><p>--should, in conjunction with MOLISA, regularly organize </p><p>training seminars and workshops for staff to improve their </p><p>professional competence. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>VOLUNTARY VERSUS COMPULSORY TREATMENT </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  MOLISA\'s Dr. Sac said that, in addition the Drug </p><p>Law, Decree 20 covered admission to drug treatment centers. </p><p>According to Dr. Sac, "many" addicts seek treatment </p><p>voluntarily because "their families are unable to cope" with </p><p>home-based or community-based treatment.  Their hope is </p><p>that, by entering a drug treatment facility, they will </p><p>receive "more professional" care.  Addicts who voluntarily </p><p>enter a center generally agree to stay one year.  During </p><p>embassy visits on provincial visits over the past fifteen </p><p>months, addicts with whom poloffs spoke (with officials </p><p>present) said that their chances for eliminating drug </p><p>addiction were better in a center than at home because (1) </p><p>in the center they are removed from drug-using peer groups; </p><p>and (2) they have some opportunity to learn skills that can </p><p>help them upon return to society. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Dr. Sac further confirmed that terms for compulsory </p><p>treatment are now longer -- up to two years, per Decree 34. </p><p>In principle, a Provincial People\'s Committee Chairman has </p><p>the final say on sending an addict for compulsory treatment. </p><p>Dr. Sac noted, however, that in reality this decision is </p><p>based on a consensus decision reached by a board consisting </p><p>of provincial representatives from the Departments of Labor, </p><p>Invalids and Social Affairs (DOLISA) and Health, as well as </p><p>from the counternarcotics police and the National Committee </p><p>for Aids, Prostitution, and Drug Control.  Dr. Sac added </p><p>that it is "usually, but not always" true that those who </p><p>enter voluntarily have "less serious" addictions compared to </p><p>those who enter on a compulsory basis. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>REALITIES ON THE GROUND </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  SODC officials freely admit that the centers are </p><p>often inadequate.  While center directors and other </p><p>officials appear genuinely interested in trying to help the </p><p>addict populations, resource constraints and a lack of </p><p>trained staff mean that many of the centers do not even meet </p><p>the GVN\'s legal requirements.  At the centers visited by </p><p>poloffs (reftels), various directors stated their adherence </p><p>to the "five step" approach specified under Circular 31, but </p><p>admitted that implementation remained uneven, depending on </p><p>center resources. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  The most impressive center visited by poloffs has </p><p>been the Hanoi Center number 6.  Living conditions for the </p><p>addict population appeared considerably better than for </p><p>students at Hanoi National University.  There were also </p><p>substantial vocational training facilities, including </p><p>welding, motorbike repair, carpentry, and tailoring. </p><p>Several addicts with whom poloffs spoke (within earshot of </p><p>center and DOLISA officials) said that the skills they were </p><p>learning would be helpful when they returned to their </p><p>families.  Poloffs also observed a recent university </p><p>graduate teaching a literacy class, as well as a stand-alone </p><p>PC used to teach basic computer skills.  This was the only </p><p>computer observed in any drug treatment center.  Yen Bai </p><p>province\'s center also appeared well above the norm, with </p><p>new dorms, an island setting, and reasonable vocational </p><p>training facilities. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Other centers  have ranged from poor to barely </p><p>adequate.  At the low end of the scale, Ha Giang province </p><p>(in northern Vietnam) had a temporarily vacant facility that </p><p>was essentially nothing more than bamboo shelters surrounded </p><p>by a barbed wire fence.  Quang Nam provincial center </p><p>(central Vietnam) appeared understaffed and even </p><p>dilapidated, with no facilities for vocational training or </p><p>rehabilitation.  The center director attributed the poor </p><p>conditions to the lack of provincial support.  Lai Chau, in </p><p>northwest Vietnam, has "at least 10,000 addicts," according </p><p>to the center\'s director, but its center has a capacity for </p><p>only 70 addicts.  A relatively low wall, a lack of guards, </p><p>and a "strong desire for drugs" had resulted in "quite a few </p><p>escapes," he admitted.  Lai Chau\'s neighboring province, Lao </p><p>Cai, is also another "drug hotspot."  Its facility was </p><p>larger (200 beds) and had a program of basic education and </p><p>vocational training, as well as considerable land outside </p><p>the facility used for farming.  Sports and cultural </p><p>activities also have improved the "quality of life, </p><p>according to the center\'s director. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ESCAPES - A CHRONIC PROBLEM </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  In addition to the apparently chronic escape </p><p>problem in Lai Chau, other centers have also experienced </p><p>escapes.  In June 2002, 369 addicts escaped from the drug </p><p>treatment center in Can Tho province in southern Vietnam </p><p>(ref F).  According to press reports at the time, this was </p><p>the third escape within seven months.  In November 2002, 188 </p><p>addicts escaped from the same facility, according to another </p><p>press report.  In addition to the Can Tho escapes, 54 </p><p>addicts escaped from a Ha Tay province facility last July; </p><p>in August, 42 escaped from the Binh Duong provincial center </p><p>(and eight others drowned while trying to escape); and 20 </p><p>escaped from the Nha Trang facility in December.  According </p><p>to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Vietnam </p><p>representative, there are "probably many other unreported </p><p>escapes." </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  Officials have offered several possible </p><p>explanations for the escape problem.  MOLISA\'s Dr. Sac </p><p>opined that Decree 34, which lengthened compulsory treatment </p><p>to two years, had "some impact," noting that the rate of </p><p>escapes "seems to be increasing."  Dr. Sac claimed that </p><p>Vietnam "badly needs" more support from foreign donors to </p><p>improve the centers and provide better training for staff. </p><p>Dr. Sac also cited "poor management and conditions" as other </p><p>factors behind escapes.  Separately, the UNODC </p><p>representative noted that the poor condition of many </p><p>facilities, the generally untrained staff, and the lack of </p><p>rehabilitation and vocational training opportunities were </p><p>all factors "not only affecting the escape rate but also </p><p>impacting the potential for reducing the high relapse rate." </p><p>The representative lamented that "some officials" in Vietnam </p><p>"still view drug treatment and detention synonymously." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>SOME HOPE FOR THE FUTURE? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  MOLISA\'s Dr. Sac said his ministry was committed </p><p>to a goal of treatment for 100 percent of all addicts, but </p><p>without a "significant increase in capacity," it would be </p><p>"extremely hard" to achieve.  MOLISA in February 2003 also </p><p>proposed that the central government support additional drug </p><p>treatment centers in "especially poor" provinces, according </p><p>to a report in "Lao Dong" newspaper report. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  Some new facilities are under construction. </p><p>According to a Vietnam News Agency report in November 2002, </p><p>a new 15,000 square meter facility is being built in </p><p>southern Vietnam\'s Binh Phuoc province.  The facility should </p><p>be completed by the end of April 2003 and will have the </p><p>capacity to treat 2,000 addicts, according to the report. </p><p>In 2002, Ho Chi Minh City opened six additional drug </p><p>treatment centers, three in partnership with the city\'s </p><p>Young Pioneers, a Communist Party mass organization.  A </p><p>large regional center is under construction in Nghe An, </p><p>about 12 kilometers from the provincial capital of Vinh; it </p><p>will include an additional 700 beds for addicts.  MOLISA\'s </p><p>Dr. Sac said that this center should be operational "within </p><p>the first quarter of 2003." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  While many GVN drug officials appear committed to </p><p>drug treatment and rehabilitation, the network of generally </p><p>modest centers seems to place more emphasis on detention </p><p>than actual treatment.  Vietnam\'s endemic problem of </p><p>insufficient public sector resources exists in the drug </p><p>treatment sector as well.  Without a big push from the </p><p>foreign donor community, major improvements in the success </p><p>of drug treatment are unlikely any time soon. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
