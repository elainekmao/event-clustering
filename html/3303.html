<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001371 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, PHUM, PREL, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: LARGE GROUP OF NEPALI MAOISTS ATTACK VILLAGE, </p><p>SINGLING OUT VICTIMS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 1198 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 1053 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 915 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Several hundred Maoists attacked a village </p><p>near western Nepal\'s largest city July 10, killing two </p><p>mainstream party workers apparently in retaliation for </p><p>cooperating with security forces.  The attackers also </p><p>brutalized other villagers and warned family members of the </p><p>victims not to hold funeral rites.  The Maoists had not </p><p>engaged in large-scale operations since June 15, the date </p><p>marking the beginning of a month-long unilateral cease-fire </p><p>called--and later retracted--by Maoist leader Prachanda. </p><p>During this time, however, the insurgents continued to kidnap </p><p>and execute soldiers and government workers, as well as </p><p>individual civilians such as teachers.  In the period since </p><p>they repulsed a major Maoist offensive on May 27, security </p><p>forces seem increasingly to have the upper hand.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Mob Raids Village, Killing Two... </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Hundreds of Maoists regulars raided a village near </p><p>Nepalgunj in the western lowlands on July 10, killing two and </p><p>injuring seven others, police sources relate.  Between three </p><p>and four hundred Maoists reportedly entered the village of </p><p>Samshergunj, about seven kilometers northwest of Nepalgunj, </p><p>about 9 p.m.  They dragged two men from their houses and </p><p>summarily executed them.  The men were activists for the </p><p>leftist Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(CPN-UML) and rightist Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), </p><p>respectively.  The insurgents also destroyed houses in the </p><p>village.  Police believe the attack came in revenge for a </p><p>June incident where two Maoists were apprehended by villagers </p><p>and turned over to authorities. </p><p> </p><p>Beating and Threatening Others </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Chief District Officer (CDO) for Banke district </p><p>related that the two men killed July 10 had been beaten </p><p>before they were shot.  According to press reports, funerals </p><p>for the two men could not be held on time because Maoists </p><p>threatened the families with violence if they proceeded with </p><p>the last rites.  The CDO also noted that during the raid </p><p>other villagers had had their legs broken with iron rods. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Representatives of the Human Rights Organization of </p><p>Nepal (HURON) told us that they planned to send a team to the </p><p>village July 14 to investigate. </p><p> </p><p>First Large-Scale Maoist Attack in Month </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The July 10 incident was the Maoists\' first </p><p>large-scale offensive military operation since its </p><p>opportunistic encounter with a bivouaced Royal Nepalese Army </p><p>(RNA) company June 12 (Ref A).  (Note:  In another, similar </p><p>encounter in late June, Maoists ran into a joint security </p><p>patrol in remote eastern Dhankuta district and killed one </p><p>policeman.  End Note.)  In a May announcement which was later </p><p>disavowed, Maoist leader Prachanda indicated that the Maoists </p><p>would unilaterally declare a cease-fire during the Nepali </p><p>month of Asadh, which began June 15 (Ref C).  July 10 was the </p><p>twenty-sixth day of the twenty-nine day month.  The only </p><p>other major incident during Asadh was the July 5 bombing of </p><p>the Prime Minister\'s party office in Kathmandu (Ref 1315). </p><p> </p><p>Abductions, Killings Continue </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) During the past month the Maoists have not launched </p><p>attacks against the security forces\' fixed positions. </p><p>However, during this period Maoists have conducted numerous </p><p>raids like the July 10 Nepalgunj incident.  In such raids at </p><p>least four RNA soldiers have been abducted from their homes </p><p>and later killed.  On other occasions the insurgents have </p><p>used this tactic against civilians as well, taking school </p><p>principals, teachers, farmers, party workers, postmen and kin </p><p>of military or police officers from their homes and killing </p><p>them.  Most of these incidents involved only small groups of </p><p>Maoists, however, and not two or three hundred as reportedly </p><p>were involved in the July 10 incident. </p><p>A Likely Anomoly </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) It remains unclear whether recent events reflect a </p><p>change in the Maoists\' tactics, a de facto unilateral </p><p>cease-fire, an expedient reaction to the increased </p><p>effectiveness of the security forces, or a combination of all </p><p>of the above.  The previous lull dated from May 27, when the </p><p>army repulsed a large-scale Maoist attack on security forces </p><p>in Rukum (Ref B).  Indications are that the RNA has become </p><p>both more sophisticated and more confident in recent weeks, </p><p>and the insurgents have been weakened as a result.  Except as </p><p>another example of the Maoists\' continued efforts to instill </p><p>fear in their countrymen, the July 10 attack, only a few </p><p>miles from a major RNA installation in Nepalgunj, seems </p><p>vindictively anomalous. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
