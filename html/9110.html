<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001339 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, ELTN, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE CASH CRUNCH TIGHTENS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The shortage of local currency continues to </p><p>worsen despite assurances by the Reserve Bank that more </p><p>money is being printed. This, in addition to other </p><p>widespread shortages in the country, has added to the burden </p><p>of most Zimbabweans, who now need wads of low-denomination </p><p>bills to procure basic necessities.  It is apparent that </p><p>most people prefer to keep their cash at home to avoid the </p><p>disappointment of not getting any at the bank or being </p><p>restricted to amounts as little as Z $5,000 (US $2.12) per </p><p>withdrawal.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>ILLEGAL TO CARRY LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  In another Alice-Through-the-Looking-Glass application </p><p>of the law, some policemen are arresting people and </p><p>confiscating the money of those who are in possession of </p><p>large amounts of local currency.  The police are arbitrarily </p><p>demanding that people account for their money on mere </p><p>suspicion that they could be involved in illegal </p><p>transactions.  The police seem oblivious to the fact that </p><p>the local currency has lost so much value that US $100 now </p><p>exchanges for Z $235,000 -- and is often only available in </p><p>$50 and $20 notes.  MP David Chapfika, the Chairman of the </p><p>GOZ\'s Budget and Finance committee, was quoted stating </p><p>"there is no need for anybody to be carrying huge stacks of </p><p>money," and that all money belongs to the government anyway. </p><p>We note for the record that the bank Chapfika once headed </p><p>collapsed from insolvency in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The much-looked-for infusion of more than Z $2 billion </p><p>in Z $500 notes, originally slated for the end of June, has </p><p>not yet materialized despite GOZ-daily headlines to the </p><p>contrary.  Commentators across the board note that the GOZ </p><p>should be printing $1,000 (or even $5,000) notes.  Some </p><p>reports indicate that a $1,000 note may be introduced by </p><p>November 1.  Those reports also hint, however, that upon its </p><p>introduction, all existing $500 notes must be converted </p><p>within a prescribed time period, after which they will no </p><p>longer be legal tender.  One local economist warns that if </p><p>the GOZ limits the amount that an individual can convert (as </p><p>has happened in other nations\' banking catastrophes), the </p><p>public stands to lose millions in capital while the GOZ </p><p>stands to gain an immense windfall.  The possibilities for </p><p>corruption under such a scenario boggle the imagination. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>MOST TRANSACTIONS NOW ON CASH BASIS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  While a few banks use the availability of cash through </p><p>their ATM machines as an incentive to account holders, even </p><p>those sources have largely dried up.  Commercial bank ATMs </p><p>which previously offered maximum withdrawals of up to Z </p><p>$90,000 (US $38.30) have been empty for the past week. </p><p>Further, many of those banks which provided large amounts of </p><p>cash through ATMs are commercial banks which cater to an </p><p>upscale clientele.  Due to structural differences such as </p><p>transaction fees and minimum balances, most Zimbabweans hold </p><p>accounts (and receive their paychecks) through building </p><p>societies and the Post Office savings bank, which are more </p><p>on a par with US homestead or savings & loan institutions. </p><p>Unfortunately, it is these institutions --  which service </p><p>the majority of the population -- that are struggling most </p><p>with the cash shortage, since they have less access to cash </p><p>than the commercial banks.  During the past few weeks, it is </p><p>routine to see queues of several hundred people lined up at </p><p>each building society branch by 6:00 am.  When the doors </p><p>finally open at 8:00 am, the patrons are often limited to Z </p><p>$5,000 to Z $10,000 (US $2.13 to $4.25) apiece. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Many businesses, including doctors and pharmacies, are </p><p>now demanding cash instead of checks because of the </p><p>downstream problems associated with withdrawing money from </p><p>the banks.  More and more shops and restaurants display </p><p>announcements that checks are not accepted.  Almost all fuel </p><p>for individual motorists is now sold on the black market, </p><p>and on a strictly cash basis.  Public transport -- whether </p><p>through commuter omnibuses or ride-sharing with a helpful </p><p>motorist with extra seats -- is available only to those with </p><p>cash.  Commercial banks now request their clients to make </p><p>prior arrangements to withdraw large amounts of cash, which </p><p>may take days or weeks to process.  Traditionally, cash has </p><p>become short at the end of the month as many employers </p><p>process their payrolls on a monthly basis, with uniformed </p><p>services drawing their pay first and civil servants last. </p><p>At the end of the month, the queues grow longer, the cash </p><p>supply becomes tighter, and the tempers of even normally </p><p>placid Zimbabweans grow short. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The burden of the cash shortage falls primarily on </p><p>ordinary Zimbabweans, and disproportionately on those least </p><p>able to afford it.  Many of the more affluent, including </p><p>diplomats and other expatriates, are shielded to some </p><p>degree, but even the Embassy\'s American employees are </p><p>limited in the amount of cash they can obtain on a weekly </p><p>basis.  This week\'s accommodation exchange through the </p><p>Embassy was US $50; last week\'s was US $40 (which is still </p><p>more than many Zimbabweans make in a month). While this </p><p>constitutes an inconvenience for Embassy employees, many </p><p>locals are making the hard decision between spending their </p><p>scarce cash on healthcare, food, or transport.  It remains </p><p>to be seen whether this situation is an aberration, rather </p><p>than a new order of business, in the quagmire of the </p><p>Zimbabwean economy. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
