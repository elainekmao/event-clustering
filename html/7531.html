<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000719 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR J. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DECL: 4/17/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, KDEM, NI, ELECTIONS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: TENSIONS MOUNT LEADING TO THE APRIL 19 </p><p>ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Despite a crowded house of 19 Presidential </p><p>candidates, the April 19 contest boils down to President </p><p>Obasanjo and ANPP candidate Muhammadu Buhari.  Holding the </p><p>ace of incumbency, Obasanjo is the likely, but not </p><p>guaranteed, victor.  He has been put on the defensive by </p><p>recent events such as the protracted gas shortage. The </p><p>shortage and other problems served to painfully remind the </p><p>Nigerian people that Obasanjo\'s first term did not produce </p><p>the expected economic "dividends of democracy."  Meanwhile, </p><p>Buhari started slowly and appeared direction-less yet </p><p>seemed to find his political compass in the later stages of </p><p>the campaign.  Results from the April 12 National Assembly </p><p>elections give the PDP a majority of the votes nation-wide </p><p>while ANPP support is mostly limited to the North.  These </p><p>results add some lift to Obasanjo\'s presumed lead. </p><p>However, Buhari and the other opposition parties have </p><p>alleged systematic vote manipulation. Buhari is meeting </p><p>with other aggrieved political leaders to discuss an </p><p>eleventh hour alliance.  If the desired deals are struck, </p><p>the dynamics of the presidential election could change </p><p>materially from the April 12 contest.  In any event, April </p><p>19 will be a tense, historic day that severely tests the </p><p>very fiber of Nigerian democracy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>For Obasanjo - An Election Not Soon Enough </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In retrospect, President Obasanjo would have wished </p><p>this election occurred in late January. In an election </p><p>immediately after the January PDP and ANPP conventions, </p><p>Obasanjo would have carried the day handsomely.  At that </p><p>point, the gap between him and Buhari was wide and appeared </p><p>unbridgeable. Conventional wisdom was that the PDP </p><p>convention was the real test (exactly what Obasanjo said to </p><p>the Ambassador at that time); the general election would be </p><p>close to a formality that had to be observed but not </p><p>worried about.  On the domestic political front, things </p><p>were relatively quiet after the conventions. There were no </p><p>crises and the Administration was looking forward to a </p><p>minor windfall because of oil prices elevated by the storm </p><p>gathering over Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Conversely, Buhari did not seem to know what to do </p><p>with the ANPP nomination once he had it.  Moreover, the </p><p>denouement of the ANPP convention had been clumsy and </p><p>fractious.  While Buhari was selected as a "consensus" </p><p>candidate, the consensus was hollow. Several rival ANPP </p><p>candidates boycotted the convention; their widely broadcast </p><p>walkout gave the appearance that the orchestrated PDP </p><p>convention was actually fairer than the ANPP\'s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Buhari seemed ineffectual as a campaigner.  His </p><p>campaign hibernated for weeks; his major negatives stuck to </p><p>him, no matter how loudly he disclaimed his past misdeeds </p><p>and missteps.  While incorruptible when it came to personal </p><p>integrity, he was feared by many to be intolerant as a </p><p>public leader. He was viewed as a religious and regional </p><p>bigot more suited to be a third party candidate who could </p><p>energize the Northern "protest", populist vote than to be </p><p>the flagbearer of the main opposition.  Many people thought </p><p>Buhari could win the Northwest without getting out of bed, </p><p>but would lose the other five zones, especially the three </p><p>in the South, no matter how hard he tried.  That his </p><p>campaign appeared dormant only confirmed this assessment; </p><p>it seemed Buhari had already conceded his was a cause that </p><p>could only end in defeat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>But Things Fall Apart </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Obasanjo\'s relative good fortune did not last; </p><p>neither did Buhari\'s somnolence.  Despite higher than </p><p>expected oil prices, the national economy reminded everyone </p><p>that it was sick; the government\'s morbidity was equally </p><p>patent. The President and National Assembly bickered over </p><p>the Anti-Corruption Commission in between their cross </p><p>exchanges over the 2003 budget.  Obasanjo and the lawmakers </p><p>could not reconcile their differences over the oil </p><p>dichotomy bill and special derivative income for oil </p><p>producing states.  People in the South-South states started </p><p>to get edgy when many state and local governments failed to </p><p>pay salaries for months. Unionized workers, including </p><p>federal and state civil servants, threatened to strike to </p><p>force the GON to honor the 12.5% pay raise the National </p><p>Labour Congress said the GON had promised.  By late </p><p>February, too much was going wrong.  It appeared the </p><p>country was being yanked from pillar to post, from problem </p><p>to problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In late March, things went from bad to worse.  The </p><p>fuel shortage brought back marathon gas lines, longer and </p><p>more intractable than those in Abacha times.  The fuel </p><p>crunch caused transportation and food prices to rise, </p><p>further pinching the too-lean wallet of the average </p><p>Nigerian. Moreover, the thousands of Nigerians who had to </p><p>wait hours in long gas lines, sometimes for days, could not </p><p>be overly enthralled with the incumbent government that </p><p>failed to spare them from this ordeal. Then, the ethnic </p><p>crisis in Warri spilled into the oil fields.  Well-armed </p><p>ethnic Ijaw militants rendered these rich oil installations </p><p>inoperable, reducing Nigeria\'s daily output by over forty </p><p>percent and completely cutting crude flows to those </p><p>refineries still operating.  For a government that derives </p><p>over eighty percent of its revenues from selling oil, the </p><p>reduction had the makings of potential economic disaster. </p><p>At a time when Obasanjo should have been demonstrating his </p><p>mastery of the ship of state, the general impression was </p><p>that the President\'s grip had become unsteady and the </p><p>country was veering out of his control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) While Obasanjo was being sorely tested, Buhari was </p><p>imperceptibly moving from weakness to relative strength. </p><p>His humble coffers forced him into a lean campaign. He had </p><p>to pick his spots judiciously; by starting late however, </p><p>Buhari\'s campaign had an unexpected salutary effect; </p><p>because he was not visible early, the public did become </p><p>inured with him. Moreover, his slowness to campaign and </p><p>failure to splash money around in the traditional political </p><p>mode, once seen as a demerit, turned into virtue.  His </p><p>campaign stops -- little reported in official media and </p><p>much of the Lagos-based press -- drew tens of thousands </p><p>without need for the financial inducement that was slowly </p><p>making a mockery of well-publicized PDP events.  It all </p><p>reinforced the notion that Buhari, although a former Head </p><p>of State, was a new breeze -- that he would not conduct </p><p>business as usual because he was not a full-fledged member </p><p>of the country\'s discredited and venal political elite. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Consequently, as Buhari started to campaign more </p><p>actively, he cashed in on his image as the upright </p><p>politician, the acme of rectitude.  More people came to see </p><p>him as a man who might be able to impart some of his </p><p>legendary self-control onto an unruly nation. Conversely, </p><p>Obasanjo was seen as drifting from crisis to crisis, </p><p>shackled by an Administration racked by corruption and </p><p>incompetence.  Faced with the emergencies of today, many </p><p>people forgot the excesses of Buhari\'s past.  While </p><p>Obasanjo fiddled or was unconcerned because he and his </p><p>cronies had fuel, Buhari would do something to end the gas </p><p>lines.  Many people began to identify with Buhari because </p><p>he was not a man of great privilege or wealth. To some </p><p>degree, he began to connect with the common man in places </p><p>outside the North. While there were still deep reservations </p><p>about Buhari\'s perceived ethnic and religious chauvinism, </p><p>and his past performance as a mediocre Head of State, </p><p>perhaps that connection would turn to votes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Going into the April 12 National Assembly election, </p><p>it appeared that Obasanjo was leading but with Buhari </p><p>gaining ground.  A close race seemed unlikely but possible. </p><p>Nigeria was tense going into the election. Uncertainty was </p><p>in the air.  Could INEC do it?  Would there be violence? </p><p>Generally, the conduct at the polls on election day went </p><p>reasonably well by local standards.  Also, the very act of </p><p>casting votes was partially cathartic for the general </p><p>public.  Consequently, there was a temporary relaxation of </p><p>tensions that would have redounded to Obasanjo\'s benefit </p><p>had his party not over-reached.  Instead, Nigeria\'s journey </p><p>through this week would be more like a frenetic roller- </p><p>coaster than a certain, well driven road. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) With election results showing the PDP maintaining </p><p>its National Assembly majority and gaining over 50 percent </p><p>of the nation-wide vote (its majority in the Senate likely </p><p>will grow significantly), opposition parties vociferously </p><p>assailed the process.  They accused the PDP, INEC and the </p><p>Army of massive, systematic vote manipulation.  There were </p><p>scores of reports of pre-stuffed replica ballot boxes. </p><p>Some of these stories are probably just that, but many of </p><p>them are credible and almost certainly true.  The ANPP </p><p>claimed an accurate vote count would have perhaps given </p><p>them a majority of National Assembly seats and definitely </p><p>much more than the 27 percent vote nationwide that INEC </p><p>results indicate. Chairmen of several opposition parties </p><p>met April 15, issuing a press statement rejecting the vote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) On April 17, Buhari flew to Lagos to meet with AD </p><p>leaders who feel equally aggrieved by the PDP\'s massive </p><p>gains in the Southwest.  The AD, and especially Afinefere, </p><p>are literally fighting for their lives.  Having been </p><p>effectively ejected from its only political home base, the </p><p>AD has nowhere to go except toward irrelevance unless it </p><p>can retain its gubernatorial seats on April 19.  The </p><p>Yoruba-dominated party thought it had a deal with the PDP </p><p>that would protect incumbents in the Southwest in exchange </p><p>for AD votes in the presidential contest.  In earnest of </p><p>that, the AD did not present a candidate for the </p><p>presidential race.  Now, AD leaders worry that voters will </p><p>abandon the AD governors to join the PDP bandwagon, dooming </p><p>the party and its socio-political underpinning, - </p><p>Afinefere.  Whether INEC results of the April 12 elections </p><p>generally reflect the way Southwesterners actually voted </p><p>seems to be of little importance at this juncture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12 (C) These developments portend an April 19 election that </p><p>will be significantly more tense than the National Assembly </p><p>election of a week ago. Tensions will be accentuated </p><p>further because gubernatorial races in hotly contested </p><p>states, such as Plateau, Anambra, Kwara and Rivers will be </p><p>that same day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) The opposition parties are afraid that, if they do </p><p>not challenge INEC\'s conduct of last week\'s elections, the </p><p>results on April 19 will mirror the April 12 vote tally. </p><p>If so, Obasanjo is assured of victory.  The PDP has over 50 </p><p>percent of the April 12 vote; while the AD pulled in just </p><p>12 percent.  Although the AD has backed out of its pact to </p><p>support Obasanjo, many AD members will still support him </p><p>out of ethnic loyalty.  A portion of AD support would give </p><p>Obasanjo a vote percentage comfortably in the upper 50\'s. </p><p>Meanwhile, the ANPP is hovering around 27 percent </p><p>nationally, with the vast majority coming from the </p><p>Northwest.  However, the ANPP is registering less than 25% </p><p>in 18, mostly southern, states.  If this low Southern tally </p><p>holds for the presidential election, Buhari will be utterly </p><p>unelectable.  The constitution not only requires a winner </p><p>to attain a national plurality, he must also receive 25% of </p><p>the vote in two-thirds of the 27 electoral jurisdictions </p><p>(36 states plus the Federal Capital Territory). Based on </p><p>the April 12 results, Buhari can count on only 18 states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) The controversy produced by the National Assembly </p><p>Election may cause an eleventh-hour shift in alignments. </p><p>First, the crumbling of the AD/PDP pact could cost Obasanjo </p><p>significant support in the Southwest.  Yet, while Buhari is </p><p>meeting with AD leaders, Obasanjo has also reached out to </p><p>the AD; but right now, the trust between Obasanjo and the </p><p>AD is gone. Conceivably the AD could swing its influence to </p><p>Buhari or at least instruct followers not to vote for </p><p>Obasanjo. Yet given ethnic loyalty and the support of the </p><p>Yoruba\'s most senior traditional leaders, Obasanjo will </p><p>likely carry the Southwest, but his margin may be reduced. </p><p>Second, the ANPP may be able to increase the voter turn-out </p><p>in the North. Third, Igbo favorite son candidates such as </p><p>the APGA\'s Ojukwu, NDP\'s Nwachukwu and UNPP\'s Nwobodo, </p><p>could take a healthy share of the votes in the Southeast, a </p><p>PDP stronghold in 1999.  Alternatively, the three could </p><p>throw their support to Buhari in protest against the </p><p>alleged manipulation of the April 12 exercise.  Fourth, </p><p>there is the immeasurable protest factor among the general </p><p>public.  There could be a turnout of voters who, in </p><p>reaction to the allegations of vote manipulation, decide to </p><p>vote for Buhari. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) A combination of three of these four possibilities </p><p>would be needed to force a close race.  This concatenation </p><p>is unlikely, yet it cannot be dismissed.  However, at this </p><p>stage, Obasanjo appears to be the much safer bet, although </p><p>that outcome will be messy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
