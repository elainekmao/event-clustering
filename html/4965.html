PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) In a repeat of the ruling PDP\'s 1999 convention, </p><p>Nigeria\'s President Olusegun Obasanjo defeated Alex Ekwueme to </p><p>become its presidential candidate, receiving 2,642 of an </p><p>estimated 3,579 votes cast (74 percent) in the first round. The </p><p>former Vice President came in a distant second with 661 votes. </p><p>Second Republic Kano State Governor Abubakar Rimi trailed with </p><p>159, and former PDP national Chairman Barnabas Gemade brought up </p><p>the rear with 17. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) However, the final tally did not reflect the pre-voting </p><p>tension.  Compared with the anxious excitement of Friday and </p><p>Saturday, the actual gathering of the delegates at Eagle square </p><p>and the voting were anti-climatic.  The atmosphere was subdued, </p><p>having none of the electricity usually associated with a hard- </p><p>fought convention.  This could be partially attributed to the </p><p>exhaustion of the delegates and contestants; many had had only a </p><p>few hours of sleep the last several nights.  However, the </p><p>primary reason for this languor was that, although the </p><p>nomination had been hard fought, the battle did not continue to </p><p>the convention floor.  By this morning, most of the errant </p><p>governors had been pulled back into the fold and Atiku, perhaps </p><p>tempted, never really strayed. Despite the suspense of the last </p><p>two days, the final results reflected what we predicted before </p><p>the convention.  Despite the unpopularity of the President among </p><p>the delegates, the power of incumbency and control of the party </p><p>machinery ultimately proved decisive.  Still Obasanjo was forced </p><p>to politick and was perhaps given a preview of how tough the </p><p>general election might be. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Because the voting had turned into a virtual no- </p><p>contest, the process ended with a first round victory.  However, </p><p>balloting consumed almost ten hours and was followed by a </p><p>tedious five-hour vote count.  The final announcement of </p><p>Obasanjo\'s victory echoed across a nearly empty Eagle Square, </p><p>with almost none of the state delegates still around.  About two </p><p>hundred of Obasanjo\'s staff and supporters were on hand for the </p><p>announcement, along with the remnants of a special 3,200-person </p><p>security presence and a few vendors looking to sell their wares. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Note: Press reports give the delegate count as 3,349; </p><p>late additions and accreditation irregularities likely account </p><p>for the difference, and then some.  A few state delegations were </p><p>smaller than reported (e.g., Abia had 95 delegates instead of </p><p>100), so the total delegates added on Friday and Saturday </p><p>probably exceeded 230.  Even if 250 fewer delegates committed to </p><p>Obasanjo had been present (3329 instead of 3579 total </p><p>delegates), Obasanjo would have polled 2392 and achieved an easy </p><p>first-round victory. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
