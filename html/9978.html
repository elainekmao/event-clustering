A representative of the US Mission to the UN Food and </p><p>Agricultural Agencies (FODAG) visited the United Nations </p><p>World Food Programme (WFP) operations in Nepal to assess </p><p>security aspects of WFP\'s on-going development activities in </p><p>view of the Maoist insurrection.  UN controls to prevent </p><p>sexual and gender-based violence against Bhutanese refugees </p><p>in eastern Nepal were also reviewed.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Background </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Upon arrival on July 26, Philip Lamade, FODAG Program </p><p>Analyst, met with WFP Country Director Erika Joergensen and </p><p>US Embassy Kathmandu RSO to discuss WFP\'s operations in </p><p>general and the security situation in particular.  Because </p><p>of security concerns, Lamade was not permitted to visit the </p><p>northern mountains or hill districts of Nepal.  From July 27 </p><p>through July 29, Lamade visited Terai districts Banke, </p><p>Bardiya, Kailali, and Kanchanpur, where he met with WFP </p><p>regional staff, Government of Nepal (GON) district </p><p>administrators, and representatives of international (GTZ) </p><p>and local NGOs.  Before departing Nepal, Lamade met with </p><p>Bill Berger, OFDA/USAID Regional Avisor, and Crystal </p><p>Kaplan, US Embassy Political fficer, and consulted again </p><p>with WFP staff regaring Bhutanese refugees. </p><p> </p><p>3. Nearly half of Nepals population lives below the poverty </p><p>line. Agricuture provides a livelihood for over 80 percent </p><p>o the population and accounts for 41 percent of GDP </p><p>Industrial activity mainly involves the processng of </p><p>agricultural produce including jute, sugarane, tobacco, and </p><p>grain. Textile and carpet prodution, accounting for about </p><p>80 percent of foreignexchange earnings in recent years, </p><p>contracted sinificantly in 2001 following the world </p><p>economic lowdown and pressures by Maoist insurgents on </p><p>fatory owners and workers. Security concerns in the wke of </p><p>Maoist activity, the June 2001 massacre of many members of </p><p>the royal family, and the September 11 terrorist attacks in </p><p>the US led to a decrease in tourism, a key source of foreign </p><p>exchange. </p><p> </p><p>4. Reference A discusses security concerns over the Maoist </p><p>insurgency, which beginning in 1996 has claimed about 7000 </p><p>lives.  Last month the Maoists closed their office in </p><p>Kathmandu, and last week they clashed with soldiers in </p><p>western Nepal, thus ending a ceasefire that had been in </p><p>effect since January 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5. UNSECOORD, through a field security office, provides </p><p>assistance to WFP and its sister agencies in Nepal as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>- Manages the interagency field security system to ensure </p><p>the integrity of the travel clearance system into districts </p><p>where UN security phases are applicable; </p><p>- Supplements mandatory WFP Security Awareness Training; and </p><p>- Provides security training for the UN Country Team and </p><p>local area security coordinators, including overseeing the </p><p>implementation of UN operating security standards and CD-ROM </p><p>training in "Basic Security in the Field - Staff Safety, </p><p>Health and Welfare." </p><p> </p><p>6. Lamade urged WFP and NGO personnel to be vigilant, follow </p><p>established security procedures, and exercise great caution </p><p>in Maoist threat areas.  Lamade also advised interlocutors </p><p>that the US is WFP\'s largest donor, and the US and other </p><p>members of WFP\'s Executive Board are the only outside </p><p>entities authorized to approve WFP\'s work plan for Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>7. Despite uncertainty regarding Maoist intentions, WFP and </p><p>NGOs uniformly expressed confidence that their projects can </p><p>and should continue. </p><p> </p><p>8. Under a separate Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation </p><p>(PRRO) and memorandum of understanding with UNHCR, WFP Nepal </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>provides food assistance to Bhutanese refugees (of Nepali </p><p>origin) that started to arrive in Nepal in late 1990.  By </p><p>1993, over 80,000 were granted prima facia refugee status. </p><p>On June 18, 2003, the latest Nepal-Bhutan joint verification </p><p>team (JVT) exercise announced that repatriation to Bhutan </p><p>may recommence as early as September, but the international </p><p>community is concerned that only a few refugee families will </p><p>be permitted repatriation. </p><p> </p><p>9. UNHCR is responsible for the protection of refugees in </p><p>the camps.  WFP provides food assistance within the </p><p>framework of letters of understanding with the GON and </p><p>UNHCR.  The Ministry of Home Affairs is the GON counterpart </p><p>responsible for refugee-related affairs and the monitoring </p><p>of assistance to refugees.  Since 1994, the Nepal Red Cross </p><p>Society has been WFP\'s operational partner managing the camp </p><p>warehouses and overseeing food distribution. </p><p> </p><p>10. In March of 2002 as an immediate response to allegations </p><p>of sexual exploitation in West Africa, a UN interagency task </p><p>force was established to support refugee communities and </p><p>prevent any reoccurrence of exploitation.  Nevertheless, </p><p>instances of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) were </p><p>discovered subsequently in the refugee camps, which resulted </p><p>in criminal prosecutions and convictions.  As of July 2003, </p><p>UNHCR reported 9 cases of refugees and 2 cases of local </p><p>workers being held in detention for SGBV offenses. </p><p> </p><p>11. In addition, the interagency task force, including WFP, </p><p>established a policy of zero tolerance toward SGBV; wrote </p><p>and promulgated a "Manual of Interagency Procedures and </p><p>Practices: Support to Refugee Communities for Prevention and </p><p>Response to Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Jhapa and </p><p>Morang Districts, Nepal;" instituted a procedure requiring </p><p>employees and implementation partners to agree to a code of </p><p>conduct; increased the number of female food distribution </p><p>monitors; and formed refugee committees to increase </p><p>awareness of SGBV in the camps. </p><p> </p><p>12. On August 25, 2003, WFP Regional Manager Anthony Banbury </p><p>is scheduled to arrive in Nepal as the head of WFP/UNHCR\'s </p><p>annual joint assessment mission.  Among other areas of </p><p>inquiry, the mission is charged with reviewing the </p><p>effectiveness of monitoring systems, including women\'s </p><p>participation in management and distribution systems. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13. FODAG agrees with Embassy Political Officer that WFP has </p><p>taken appropriate precautions to contend with Maoists </p><p>security risks and that its country program should continue </p><p>despite these risks.  In addition, FODAG finds that WFP has </p><p>implemented necessary policies and procedures designed to </p><p>prevent future instances of sexual and gender-based violence </p><p>in Nepal generally and specifically related to refugee </p><p>populations.
