<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 005237 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KPAL, ASEC, PTER </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ:  JORDANIAN REACTION TO POINTS ON PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>UNGA SPEECH </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 175469 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Douglas A. Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In the absence of FonMin Muasher (who is leading the </p><p>Jordanian delegation to the UNGA in New York), A/DCM </p><p>delivered ref points to Muasher\'s personal assistant, Ali </p><p>al-Ayed September 12.  A/DCM urged that the GOJ express </p><p>public support for the President\'s themes, as well as the </p><p>GOJ\'s willingness to engage in further consultations on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Al-Ayed said Jordanians are concerned about the </p><p>President\'s remarks and what they will mean for Jordan.  He </p><p>was pleased to see from the President\'s themes that the U.S. </p><p>appears to be taking a multilateral and scrupulously legal </p><p>approach to Iraq\'s non-compliance with UNSCRs and will take </p><p>its case to the Security Council.  Al-Ayed said that the GOJ </p><p>had recently reiterated to senior Iraqi visitors (VP Ramadan </p><p>as well as the Iraqi Trade and Information ministers) the </p><p>need for Iraq to abide by all UNSCRs and permit the return of </p><p>UN arms inspectors. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  However, he continued, some of the points in the </p><p>speech, while true, will have little resonance with the </p><p>Jordanian public.  For example, the statement that Iraq has </p><p>consistently defied the UN is equally true of Israel, and </p><p>Jordanians will see a U.S. push for action against Iraq as </p><p>further evidence of the perceived bias of U.S. policy in the </p><p>region.  Finally, he said, even though the U.S. is pledging </p><p>to take its case against Iraq to the UNSC, the mention of </p><p>"unavoidable action" in the final point seems to indicate </p><p>that the U.S. remains convinced of the need to conduct </p><p>military action against Iraq. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
