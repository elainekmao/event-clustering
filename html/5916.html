(SBU) Summary.  Honduras is putting the finishing touches </p><p>on a package of laws that will put the GOH\'s fiscal house in </p><p>order and satisfy the International Monetary Fund (IMF) team </p><p>negotiating the terms of Honduras\' three-year Poverty </p><p>Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program.  The package </p><p>will include the long-awaited Civil Service Framework bill </p><p>that will supercede the salary provisions in the profession- </p><p>specific laws (called estatutos); expenditure measures that </p><p>will reduce the central government wage bill to 10.1 percent </p><p>of GDP in 2003 and reduce the wage bill of the entire public </p><p>sector by one percent of GDP annually in 2004 and 2005; and </p><p>a series of revenue measures that will widen the tax base </p><p>for income and sales taxes.   The only important tax </p><p>exemption elimination that the GOH plans to propose to </p><p>Congress is the exemption for fuel products used in the </p><p>power sector; however, it appears that the other tax </p><p>measures will be sufficient to lower the deficit </p><p>significantly.  The IMF and GOH are also working together </p><p>closely on improvements to the financial sector.   The GOH </p><p>hopes the whole fiscal package will go to Congress by the </p><p>end of February and will be approved by mid March.  The goal </p><p>is to sign a letter of intent with the Fund by the end of </p><p>March.  The GOH believes that the letter of intent would be </p><p>sufficient to hold off pressure from Paris Club creditors, </p><p>until IMF Board approval in June.  Much will depend on the </p><p>GOH\'s skill in getting the measures through Congress.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In a February 18 meeting with econoffs, Minister of </p><p>Finance Arturo Alvarado explained that the GOH is very close </p><p>to an agreement with the IMF on the terms of Honduras\' three- </p><p>year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program.   The </p><p>program includes commitments on creating a professional </p><p>civil service, reducing the wage bill as a percent of GDP, </p><p>and adopting revenue measures.  According to Ministry of </p><p>Finance projections, this will bring the central government </p><p>deficit down to three percent of GDP in 2003 (a marked </p><p>improvement over the last two years). The IMF and GOH are </p><p>also working together closely on policy changes to </p><p>strengthen the financial sector. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) After contentious late January meetings between the </p><p>GOH and IMF in Washington (in which the Fund at first </p><p>insisted on a constitutional amendment), there is now a </p><p>basic agreement on the text of the long-awaited Civil </p><p>Service Framework bill.  Article 110 of the bill will </p><p>replace the salary provisions in the profession-specific </p><p>laws - the so-called estatutos - immediately upon entry into </p><p>force, except for the phasing in of the salary increases for </p><p>teachers by 2006.   Alvarado is waiting for the IMF\'s final </p><p>comments on the draft bill (due any day now). </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The GOH identified expenditure measures that will </p><p>allow it to reduce the central government wage bill to 10.1 </p><p>percent of GDP in 2003.  Many of these measures have already </p><p>been implemented (wage freeze for non-unionized employees, </p><p>elimination of 60 percent of vacant positions, elimination </p><p>of ghost workers, retirement of public sector workers over </p><p>the age of 65, etc.).  For 2004 and 2005, the GOH convinced </p><p>the Fund they would have more flexibility to reduce the wage </p><p>bill an additional one percent of GDP per year if they </p><p>included the entire public sector.  Alvarado noted that </p><p>reductions in staff are already underway in autonomous </p><p>government agencies such as SANAA (the state water and </p><p>sanitation company) and COHDEFOR (the Forestry Service). </p><p>The IMF team agreed to exclude the severance payments from </p><p>the wage bill calculations.  Note: IMF contacts indicate </p><p>that the GOH still needs to present more detail on these </p><p>planned expenditure measures in order to obtain Fund staff </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The third part of the package is a series of </p><p>revenue measures (amounting to at least 2.5 percent of GDP) </p><p>that will widen the tax base for income and sales taxes. </p><p>Many bonuses and allowances will now be included as income </p><p>in the calculation for income tax and the minimum level of </p><p>salary for individuals subject to the tax will be reduced. </p><p>A type of withholding tax will be implemented for companies. </p><p>Many more products will be subject to the sales tax, leaving </p><p>only basic foods and medicines tax free (i.e., an expanded </p><p>"basic basket of goods").  The government still plans to </p><p>eliminate the tax exemption for fuel products used in the </p><p>power sector and will direct the state electricity company </p><p>ENEE to negotiate compensatory adjustments for the price of </p><p>electricity in its contracts with the private power </p><p>generators.  The expected increased revenue from these </p><p>measures is expected to be: </p><p>         Income tax                0.9 percent of GDP </p><p>         Sales tax                 0.5 percent of GDP </p><p>         Oil taxes and others      1.1 percent of GDP </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Econcouns noted that the GOH has backed away from </p><p>its intent to reduce the numerous special tax exemptions for </p><p>companies, and that this would put the GOH on the defensive </p><p>as only raising taxes on the poor and lower middle class. </p><p>Alvarado acknowledged that elimination of special exemptions </p><p>turned out to be politically unfeasible.  The GOH will do </p><p>its best to explain to the public that in fact tax rates are </p><p>not being raised.  Note: IMF sources indicated concern this </p><p>week that the GOH might back off from some of the measures, </p><p>based on criticism from the public. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Alvarado, who is consulting closely with President </p><p>of Congress Porfirio "Pepe" Lobo, hopes the whole fiscal </p><p>package will go to Congress the week of February 24 and will </p><p>be approved in Congress by early to mid March.  The IMF team </p><p>would then return to Honduras March 24 to finalize and sign </p><p>off on a letter of intent on a PRGF program by March 31. </p><p>The package would go to the IMF Board in June.  The Fund </p><p>staff said that once a letter of intent is signed, they </p><p>would signal to the Paris Club that the GOH is basically </p><p>back on track, taking pressure off from official bilateral </p><p>creditors for resumed debt payments.  Honduras\' extension of </p><p>debt relief from the Paris Club runs out on March 31. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Comment: Although the umbrella public sector </p><p>organization COHEP expressed solidarity with the GOH on the </p><p>need to regain fiscal equilibrium and stop the dramatic </p><p>growth in public sector salaries (and despite the fact that </p><p>the current plan leaves many investment incentives intact), </p><p>key private sector groups have started to complain about the </p><p>proposed tax measures.  Government pronouncements about the </p><p>measures, their impact on the poor, and the relationship to </p><p>the GOH\'s need for an IMF program have been confusing and </p><p>inconsistent.  The next few weeks will be a key test of the </p><p>Maduro government\'s commitment (and ability) to take the </p><p>needed measures. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
