(SBU) POST WELCOMES DEPARTMENT\'S DECISION TO LAUNCH AN </p><p>EXBS PROGRAM IN CROATIA AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT </p><p>ON THE EXBS PROGRAM "ROAD MAP" (REF A).  THE TECHNICAL </p><p>PROGRAMS AND TRAINING THAT COME WITH THE EXBS PROGRAM GIVE US </p><p>ADDED LEVERAGE TO FOSTER INCREASED GOC COOPERATION ON </p><p>REGIONAL SECURITY AND ARMS CONTROL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>THE EXBS ENVIRONMENT IN CROATIA </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00914  01 OF 02  250603Z </p><p>2. (SBU) THE ASSISTANCE ENVIRONMENT IN CROATIA IS COMPLEX AND </p><p>HAS CHANGED MARKEDLY SINCE THE EXBS ASSESSMENT TEAM CAME TO </p><p>ZAGREB IN MARCH 2002.  CROATIA, UNDER THE EU\'S STABILIZATION </p><p>AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT, HAS BEGUN TO RECEIVE MILLIONS OF </p><p>EUROS IN ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE EU/CARDS PROGRAM. </p><p>APPROXIMATELY EURO 14 MILLION PER YEAR FROM 2002 TO 2004 IS </p><p>EARMARKED FOR BORDER CONTROL, POLICE AND CUSTOMS REFORM AND </p><p>ASYLUM ISSUES.  EU MEMBER STATES ALSO PROVIDE LIMITED </p><p>BILATERAL ASSISTANCE ON BORDER SECURITY ISSUES.  THE USG, </p><p>THROUGH THE INL- AND SEED-FUNDED PROGRAMS PROVIDES </p><p>APPROXIMATELY USD 1.5 MILLION PER YEAR IN ASSISTANCE FOR </p><p>POLICE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR REFORM.  U.S. PROGRAMS ARE </p><p>DUE TO PHASE OUT IN FY 2004.  WE RECENTLY ALSO LAUNCHED THE </p><p>DOD-MANAGED WMD COUNTER-PROLIFERATION PROGRAM.  OUR CHALLENGE </p><p>IS TO ENSURE THAT THE EXBS PROGRAM COMPLEMENTS AND DOES NOT </p><p>COMPETE WITH THESE EXISTING INITIATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE EU FACTOR IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT.  CROATIA\'S </p><p>PRINCIPAL FOREIGN POLICY GOAL IS EU MEMBERSHIP.  OUR </p><p>EXPERIENCE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THAT CROATIAN POLICY-MAKERS </p><p>WILL SHY AWAY FROM IMPLEMENTING ANY INITIATIVE SHOULD THEY </p><p>BELIEVE THAT ITS PRESCRIPTIONS ARE IN CONFLICT WITH EU </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS OR PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) WHILE THE ASSISTANCE FIELD IS CROWDED, THE EXBS </p><p>PROGRAM ADDRESSES A UNIQUE NEED.  THE EU\'S PROGRAMS ARE </p><p>FOCUSED ON CROATIA\'S EXTENSIVE UNDER-MANNED AND </p><p>UNDER-EQUIPPED LAND BORDER: CROATIAN PORTS AND MARITIME </p><p>SECURITY ISSUES LARGELY HAVE BEEN IGNORED BY THE EU.  NEITHER </p><p>DOES THE CARDS PROGRAM ENVISION INITIATIVES TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>CROATIAN CONTROLS OVER ARMS AND DUAL USE EXPORTS.  U.S. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00914  01 OF 02  250603Z </p><p>CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS COULD PROVIDE A </p><p>USEFUL LAUNCHING PAD FOR SOME EXBS INITIATIVES, BUT THEIR </p><p>EMPHASIS LAYS ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DURING OUR BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS IN FEBRUARY </p><p>2003, GOC REPRESENTATIVES ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE LACK OF </p><p>INTER-AGENCY COOPERATION SERIOUSLY DEGRADED CROATIA\'S ABILITY </p><p>TO CONTROL ITS BORDERS AND TO MANAGE CRISES.  WHILE SOME </p><p>REFORMERS IN THE GOC ARE READY TO CREATE AN INTER-AGENCY </p><p>COMMITTEE TO COORDINATE BORDER AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT ISSUES, </p><p>BUREAUCRATIC RESISTANCE WITHIN THE GOC HAS STYMIED THIS </p><p>INITIATIVE TO DATE.  BY TARGETING OUR EXBS ASSISTANCE, WE </p><p>HOPE TO ENCOURAGE THE GOC TO STAND UP SUCH A COMMITTEE IN </p><p>ORDER TO MANAGE THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD FLOW FROM THE EXBS </p><p>AND WMD PROGRAMS.  SUCH A SINGLE FOCAL POINT WOULD MAKE OUR </p><p>ASSISTANCE DELIVERY MORE EFFICIENT AS WELL AS ENHANCE THE </p><p>OVERALL BORDER SECURITY/CRISIS MANAGEMENT CAPACITY OF </p><p>CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>WAY AHEAD </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.
