<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 ABU DHABI 003777 </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, ETRD, EFIN, PTER, KPRP, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: THOUGHTS ON IRAN - THE LION AND THE CAGE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 15528 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY: DAVID D. PEARCE, CONSUL GENERAL. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) SUMMARY </p><p>THIS CABLE EXAMINES SOME OF THE VARIABLES AFFECTING </p><p>IRANIAN GOVERNMENT DECISIONMAKING -- ESPECIALLY REGARDING </p><p>POLICIES WE OPPOSE -- FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE WIDE </p><p>VARIETY OF IRANIAN CONTACTS WE INTERVIEW IN DUBAI. WE HAVE </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT THE REGIME VIEWS SOME ISSUES, INCLUDING ITS </p><p>EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS, AS SURVIVAL ISSUES. </p><p>ON THESE, IT IS UNLIKELY TO NEGOTIATE MEANINGFULLY, AT </p><p>LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM. OTHER POLICIES OF CONCERN, </p><p>INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR VIOLENT OPPOSITION TO THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS, ARE RESPECT ISSUES. THESE STEM FROM AN IMPULSE </p><p>TO DEMONSTRATE IRANIAN INDEPENDENCE, ESPECIALLY VIS-A-VIS </p><p>THE U.S. BUT UNLIKE SURVIVAL ISSUES, RESPECT ISSUES ARE </p><p>SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGE IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) OUR IRANIAN CONTACTS BELIEVE THE REGIME MAY BE OPEN </p><p>TO SUCH CHANGE, BUT WITHOUT APPEARING SO. THAT MEANS ANY </p><p>TURNAROUND ON KEY ISSUES WILL BE INCREMENTAL, AND POSSIBLY </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY A FEINT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. ON THE </p><p>BIGGEST ISSUE OF ALL FOR IRAN -- RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. - </p><p>- REGIME LEADERS REALIZE THAT DIALOGUE AND RENEWAL OF TIES </p><p>ARE INEVITABLE, BUT THEY REMAIN DEEPLY DIVIDED OVER HOW </p><p>AND WHEN THIS SHOULD OCCUR. THE IRANIANS WE HAVE SPOKEN </p><p>WITH AFFIRM THAT IRAN HAS INDEED FELT THE EFFECTS OF U.S. </p><p>PRESSURE BUT THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO WILL PROVE </p><p>HIGHLY RESISTANT TO MAKING POLICY CHANGES IN THE FACE OF </p><p>THAT PRESSURE. SOME ACTIONS, NOTABLY HIGH-LEVEL PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS, CAN ACTUALLY LENGTHEN THE ODDS AGAINST CHANGE. </p><p>EVEN WHERE WE HAVE HAD MOST EFFECT, E.G. LIMITING ACCESS </p><p>TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN IRAN\'S OIL SECTOR, SOME OF OUR </p><p>CONTACTS WARN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PRESSURE WILL DIMINISH </p><p>OVER TIME AS IRAN\'S ABILITY TO COPE IMPROVES. AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, THE REGIME HAS REAL VULNERABILITIES, AND IF </p><p>SANCTIONS ALONE DO NOT A POLICY MAKE, SANCTIONS CAN AND </p><p>SHOULD BE A USEFUL ADJUNCT OF POLICY, ASSUMING WE WORK </p><p>WITH ALLIES TO FASHION A COMMON POLITICAL UNDERPINNING FOR </p><p>JOINT ACTION. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) INTRODUCTION </p><p>THIS MESSAGE WAS DRAFTED BY THE CONSUL GENERAL IN DUBAI, </p><p>DRAWING ON THE OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIENCE OF ALL IRAN </p><p>REPORTERS AT THE CONSULATE GENERAL. THE DRAFT WAS </p><p>COORDINATED CLOSELY WITH EMBASSY ABU DHABI. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) SURVIVAL AND RESPECT </p><p>THE U.S. HAS SOUGHT TO USE SANCTIONS AND PRESSURE TO </p><p>CONTAIN IRAN. UNDERSTANDING THE MOTIVES BEHIND IRAN\'S </p><p>POLICIES IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD EVALUATING THE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR POLICY TOWARD IRAN. FROM OUR </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF IRANIAN BUSINESSMEN, </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND TECHNOCRATS, PROFESSIONALS AND ACADEMICS, </p><p>THE PRIORITIES OF THE CLERICAL REGIME APPEAR TO BE </p><p>CHANNELED THROUGH TWO MAIN FILTERS: 1) SURVIVAL, AND 2) </p><p>RESPECT. ISSUES THE REGIME BELIEVES AFFECT ITS SURVIVAL </p><p>ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE, AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM. BY </p><p>CONTRAST, ISSUES CONCERNING RESPECT FOR IRAN\'S </p><p>INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION CAN CHANGE IN THE RIGHT </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) IRAN-E ZAMIN, THE LAND OF IRAN </p><p>IT IS CLEAR FROM MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT IRANIANS HAVE A </p><p>VERY DISTINCT NOTION IN THEIR MIND\'S EYE OF WHAT THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S SPHERE OF INFLUENCE SHOULD BE. IT EVEN HAS A </p><p>NAME: IRAN-E ZAMIN, THE LAND OF IRAN. IRAN-E ZAMIN GOES </p><p>BEYOND THE ACCEPTED CURRENT BORDERS OF IRAN, AND IS </p><p>ROUGHLY DEFINED BY THE EXTENT OF IRAN\'S TRADITIONAL </p><p>CULTURAL INFLUENCE. TO THE EAST, THIS AREA INCLUDES </p><p>WESTERN AFGHANISTAN, TO THE NORTH IT INCLUDES CONTIGUOUS </p><p>AREAS OF CENTRAL ASIA, AZERBAIJAN, AND ARMENIA, AND TO THE </p><p>WEST AND SOUTH IT INCLUDES KURDISH AREAS, EASTERN IRAQ, </p><p>AND THE ENTIRE ARAB LITTORAL OF THE PERSIAN GULF. IRAN-E </p><p>ZAMIN IS A GEO-STRATEGIC CONCEPT. THE ARAB-ISRAELI PEACE </p><p>PROCESS FALLS OUTSIDE THE ENVELOPE; THE DISPUTE WITH THE </p><p>UAE OVER THREE SMALL ISLANDS FALLS WITHIN. IRAN-E ZAMIN </p><p>IS ALSO DISTINCT FROM THE RULING CLERICS\' RELIGIOUS </p><p>AFFINITY FOR SHIA COMMUNITIES, E.G. IN SOUTH LEBANON, </p><p>WHICH -- ALTHOUGH PERHAPS GENUINELY FELT BY SOME IRANIAN </p><p>SHIA -- IS FAR LESS DEEPLY ROOTED. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) NEGOTIABLE AND NON-NEGOTIABLE </p><p>THIS REGIME HAS SHOWN THAT, IF ITS SURVIVAL IS PERCEIVED </p><p>TO BE IN PLAY, IT WILL EMPLOY ANY AVAILABLE MEANS, WHETHER </p><p>TERRORISM ABROAD OR INTERNAL REPRESSION AT HOME, TO COMBAT </p><p>THE SUPPOSED THREAT. THIS IS THE INGREDIENT THAT MAKES </p><p>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RHETORICAL ATTACKS AND SUICIDE </p><p>ATTACKS, BETWEEN CLOSING DOWN NEWSPAPERS AND ASSASSINATING </p><p>OPPONENTS. WHETHER EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL, THE REGIME DOES </p><p>NOT CONSIDER SURVIVAL ISSUES NEGOTIABLE. "THEY LEARNED </p><p>FROM THE SHAH\'S MISTAKES," AN IRANIAN BUSINESS CONTACT </p><p>EXPLAINED. "IF FOUR PEOPLE GATHER, THEY BREAK IT UP. </p><p>THEY WON\'T LET THE SAME HAPPEN TO THEM AS HAPPENED TO THE </p><p>SHAH. AND IF NECESSARY, THEY WILL KILL." </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) WMD -- NO QUICK TURNAROUND </p><p>ONE SUCH ISSUE IS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. AS WITH </p><p>INDIA AND PAKISTAN, THE PROBLEM WITH IRAN IS LIKELY TO BE </p><p>BOTH DIFFICULT AND LONG-TERM, AND REQUIRE CAREFUL </p><p>MONITORING. IRAQ USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST IRAN AND </p><p>CAME CLOSE TO DEVELOPING A NUCLEAR BOMB. RUSSIA, </p><p>PAKISTAN, AND INDIA ALL HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE </p><p>IRANIANS CONSIDER ISRAEL A NUCLEAR THREAT, AND A HOSTILE </p><p>U.S. HAS NUCLEAR-CAPABLE FORCES PRESUMED TO BE RANGED </p><p>ALONG THE IRANIAN COASTLINE IN THE GULF. IN THIS </p><p>SITUATION, ANY REGIME IN IRAN IS LIKELY TO PURSUE EFFORTS </p><p>TO GET THE BOMB AS A TOP NATIONAL SECURITY PRIORITY, </p><p>WHATEVER THE PROTESTATIONS TO THE CONTRARY. IN THE END, </p><p>THE BEST DETERRENT WILL BE THE REBIRTH OF RESPONSIBLE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL BEHAVIOR IN IRAN ITSELF -- BUT THIS IS A </p><p>MEDIUM- TO LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE AT BEST, WITH SCANT </p><p>PROSPECT OF POSITIVE MOVEMENT WHILE IRAN\'S LEADERSHIP IS </p><p>FEELING ISOLATED AND BESIEGED. </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) ASSASSINATIONS -- UNEASY LIES THE TURBAN </p><p>ANOTHER SURVIVAL ISSUE, ALTHOUGH POSSIBLY NOT QUITE SO </p><p>LONG-TERM, IS THE USE OF ASSASSINATIONS AS STATE POLICY. </p><p>OVER THE YEARS, THE TEHRAN REGIME HAS BEEN IN THE HABIT OF </p><p>KILLING ITS OPPONENTS, WHETHER AT HOME OR ABROAD. THIS IS </p><p>ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR GROUPS SUCH AS THE IRAQ-SUPPORTED </p><p>MUJAHEDIN-E KHALQ, WHOM THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT HOLDS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR VARIOUS ASSASSINATIONS AND TERRORIST </p><p>BOMBINGS INSIDE IRAN. THE IRANIANS WE MEET HERE DO NOT </p><p>ENDORSE THE REGIME\'S KILLINGS; MOST FIND THEM ABHORRENT. </p><p>BUT THEY SHRUG AND SAY IT\'S IN THE NATURE OF THIS CLERICAL </p><p>REGIME. SOME GO ON TO ACCUSE THE U.S. OF SELECTIVE </p><p>INDIGNATION, AND POINTEDLY RECALL WHAT THEY CONSIDER THE </p><p>COMPARATIVELY MUTED OFFICIAL U.S. REACTION OVER THE YEARS </p><p>TO ASSASSINATIONS OF PALESTINIANS ALLEGEDLY AT THE HANDS </p><p>OF ISRAELI AGENTS IN EUROPEAN AND MIDDLE EAST COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) EVEN IF THE MYKONOS TRIAL BRINGS THE U.S. AND </p><p>EUROPE CLOSER TO A MEETING OF THE MINDS ON IRAN, OUR </p><p>CONTACTS BELIEVE THE CURRENT SIEGE MENTALITY OF IRAN\'S TOP </p><p>RULERS WILL MAKE THEM RELUCTANT TO LET GO OF THE VIEW THAT </p><p>ASSASSINATION IS A LEGITIMATE INSTRUMENT OF STATE POLICY. </p><p>THEY MAY REGRET GETTING CAUGHT. IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE THAT </p><p>THEY WILL SCALE BACK OR SHIFT SUCH OPERATIONS, E.G. FROM </p><p>EUROPE TO SOUTH ASIA, IN RESPONSE TO PUBLIC RELATIONS </p><p>PROBLEMS AND STRAINS IN KEY TRADING RELATIONSHIPS. BUT </p><p>THEY ARE ONLY LIKELY TO STOP WHEN THEY FEEL SUFFICIENTLY </p><p>SECURE IN THEIR SEATS TO CONSIDER THAT THEIR OPPONENTS NO </p><p>LONGER POSE A SERIOUS THREAT. AT THAT POINT, OF COURSE, </p><p>IT IS NO LONGER A SURVIVAL ISSUE. IF CHANGE COMES ON THIS </p><p>FRONT IT WILL BE A MATTER OF OUR KNOWING IT WHEN WE NO </p><p>LONGER SEE IT. IT WILL NEITHER BE ANNOUNCED OR </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED, WHETHER IN PUBLIC OR PRIVATE CHANNELS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) THE QUEST FOR RESPECT </p><p>IN CONTRAST TO THESE PERCEIVED SURVIVAL ISSUES, POLICIES </p><p>THAT ARE MAINLY MANIFESTATIONS OF THE IRANIAN QUEST FOR </p><p>INDEPENDENCE MAY BE NEGOTIABLE. THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION </p><p>WAS ABOUT RESPECT -- BOTH SELF-RESPECT, AND EARNING THE </p><p>RESPECT OF OTHERS FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF IRANIAN </p><p>DECISIONMAKING. SINCE THE U.S. WAS FIRMLY IDENTIFIED WITH </p><p>THE SHAH, INDEPENDENCE FROM U.S. INFLUENCE BECAME, AND </p><p>REMAINS, A CRITICAL ELEMENT IN THE REGIME\'S SEARCH FOR </p><p>LEGITIMACY. THIS IS WHY THE U.S. STATUS OF FORCES </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH IRAN BECAME SUCH AN ICON IN THE COURSE OF </p><p>AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI\'S YEARS-LONG STRUGGLE WITH THE SHAH. </p><p>REFERRING TO IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION IN IRANIAN COURTS </p><p>FOR U.S. MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL, KHOMEINI </p><p>FULMINATED THAT THEY HAVE REDUCED THE IRANIAN PEOPLE "TO A </p><p>LEVEL LOWER THAN THAT OF AN AMERICAN DOG." ON THIS COUNT </p><p>-- ASSERTING IRANIAN INDEPENDENCE -- EVEN PRO-SHAH </p><p>IRANIANS GIVE THE ISLAMIC REGIME CREDIT. THEREFORE, A </p><p>PREEMINENT CONSIDERATION FOR IRAN\'S RULERS ON ANY CONTACTS </p><p>WITH THE U.S., WILL BE HOW TO ENGAGE WITHOUT APPEARING TO </p><p>COMPROMISE THIS PRIZED INDEPENDENCE. FOR THAT REASON, NO </p><p>IRANIAN LEADERS CAN BE SEEN TO BE ACCEPTING "U.S. </p><p>PRECONDITIONS" FOR DIALOGUE, EVEN IF THEY WANT TO. </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) BECAUSE THE INDEPENDENCE THEME HAS SO MUCH </p><p>RESONANCE WITH THE POPULATION AT LARGE, THE RULING CLERICS </p><p>PROBABLY FIND EXTERNAL PRESSURE BY THE U.S. AND OTHERS </p><p>QUITE USEFUL INTERNALLY. OUR IRANIAN CONTACTS FIND IT </p><p>INCREDIBLE THAT WE SEEM NOT TO SEE THIS. IN FACT, THEY </p><p>FIND IT SO INCREDIBLE THAT THEY BELIEVE WE ACTUALLY DO SEE </p><p>IT BUT ARE CHOOSING TO DELIBERATELY AND SUBTLY HELP THE </p><p>REGIME. THEREFORE, THE REASONING GOES, THE U.S. HAS SOME </p><p>NEFARIOUS PURPOSE IN MIND AND HAS STRUCK A FAUSTIAN </p><p>BARGAIN TO KEEP THE CURRENT REGIME IN POWER AT THE EXPENSE </p><p>OF THE IRANIAN PEOPLE. THIS MAKES THEM DESPAIR; ONCE </p><p>AGAIN, THEY SEE THEIR FATE AS IN THE HANDS OF MANIPULATIVE </p><p>GREAT POWERS OUTSIDE THEIR BORDERS. FROM HERE IT IS ONLY </p><p>A SHORT LEAP TO THE FERVENT STATEMENT THAT THE U.S. OUSTED </p><p>THE SHAH AND INSTALLED KHOMEINI BECAUSE IRAN WAS BECOMING </p><p>TOO POWERFUL IN THE REGION FOR OUR TASTE. ALTHOUGH THIS </p><p>MAY SOUND INCREDIBLE AND FAR-FETCHED TO AMERICAN EARS, </p><p>VARIANTS OF THIS BELIEF ARE AMAZINGLY WIDESPREAD AMONG THE </p><p>IRANIANS WE MEET. WE NOTE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ECHOES OF </p><p>THE SAME THEME IN ANKARA\'S REPORTING, AS WELL AS IN SOME </p><p>PRESS ACCOUNTS. </p><p> </p><p>13. (S) IRANIAN OPPOSITION TO THE PEACE PROCESS -- THE </p><p>HOLE CARD </p><p>IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT SEVERAL OF OUR IRANIAN SOURCES HAVE </p><p>SEPARATELY COMMENTED TO US THAT THEY SEE THE IRANIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY VIS-A-VIS THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE </p><p>PROCESS (MEPP) IN TERMS OF THE INDEPENDENCE ISSUE. IT IS </p><p>STRIKING -- AND IN VERY DISTINCT CONTRAST TO OUR ARAB </p><p>CONTACTS -- THAT MOST IRANIANS WE MEET COULDN\'T CARE LESS </p><p>ABOUT THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT. OUR CONTACTS, INCLUDING </p><p>FREQUENT AND WELL-CONNECTED VISITORS TO IRAN, INTERPRET </p><p>IRAN\'S ACTIONS ON THE PEACE PROCESS AS CALCULATED TO SHOW </p><p>INDEPENDENCE OF DECISIONMAKING, ESPECIALLY VIS-A-VIS THE </p><p>U.S. THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ISSUE, HOWEVER, IS NOT A </p><p>SURVIVAL MATTER AND FALLS WELL OUTSIDE THE CORE DOMAIN OF </p><p>IRANIAN NATIONALIST CONCERNS. SO THEORETICALLY AT LEAST, </p><p>THIS POLICY IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>14. (S) OUR CONTACTS BELIEVE THE REGIME CALCULATES THAT </p><p>THE ARAB-ISRAELI PEACE PROCESS, AND SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT </p><p>FOR ISRAEL, IS THE SINGLE MOST NEURALGIC BUTTON THEY CAN </p><p>PRESS WITH THE U.S. THAT MAKES IT AN EXTREMELY HIGH-VALUE </p><p>CARD, WHETHER FOR ASSERTING IRANIAN INDEPENDENCE OF THE </p><p>U.S. OR, EVENTUALLY, FOR BARGAINING. SINCE IT IS A BAZAAR </p><p>ISSUE, THOUGH, IT LIKELY WILL ONLY BE PLAYED IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. AND EVEN THEN ONLY IN </p><p>THE CONTEXT OF A MAJOR QUID-PRO-QUO. UNTIL THEN, THERE IS </p><p>NOT MUCH CHANCE OF SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT ON THIS IRANIAN </p><p>POLICY, INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE NOTWITHSTANDING. WHAT IS </p><p>AT STAKE IS NOT PRINCIPLE OR SURVIVAL, BUT THE PERCEPTION </p><p>OF INDEPENDENT DECISIONMAKING AND TRADING VALUE, BOTH OF </p><p>WHICH WILL BE WEIGHED CAREFULLY AGAINST PROSPECTIVE GAINS. </p><p> </p><p>15. (S) IRANIAN QUIDS -- "B1" HAGUE CLAIM TOPS THE LIST </p><p>WHAT WOULD THE IRANIAN QUIDS BE? REPEATED STATEMENTS BY </p><p>IRANIAN PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI SUGGEST THAT THE MAIN QUID </p><p>IRAN SEEKS FROM THE U.S. IN ANY TALKS IS A LUMP-SUM </p><p>SETTLEMENT OF OUTSTANDING HAGUE TRIBUNAL CLAIMS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE "B1" FMS CLAIM. RAFSANJANI HAS SPOKEN OF </p><p>RELEASE OF THIS MONEY AS THE "GOOD WILL" GESTURE REQUIRED </p><p>EVEN TO START ANY SERIOUS DIALOGUE. AT THE SAME TIME, HE </p><p>KNOWS THE ISSUE HAS BEEN LITIGATED AT THE HAGUE FOR YEARS </p><p>AND IT IS DOUBTFUL HE WOULD REALLY EXPECT TO GET SUCH A </p><p>GESTURE FOR NOTHING. MORE LIKELY, HE IS SETTING UP A </p><p>CONDITION FOR TALKS HE KNOWS WE WON\'T MEET AS A </p><p>SMOKESCREEN -- BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE IRANIAN SIDE ITSELF </p><p>HAS NO CONSENSUS YET FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>16. (S) THE PUBLIC SIDE OF IRANPOLICY: LESS IS MORE </p><p>THE IRANIANS HATE BEING IGORED. THE MORE WE LAMBASTE THE </p><p>ISLAMIC REPUBLIC,THE BETTER THIS REGIME LIKES IT. U.S. </p><p>STATEMENT DON\'T CHANGE IRANIAN POLICY, BUT THEY ARE </p><p>BIG-TME NEGATIVE ATTENTION, AND THIS IS PURE GOLD FOR TE </p><p>REGIME\'S INTERNAL USE. WHAT THEY FIND TOUGH T FIELD ARE </p><p>THINGS LIKE FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARYPELLETREAU\'S </p><p>STATEMENT IN DUBAI LAST WINTER. THS KIND OF FACTUAL, </p><p>SENSIBLE RESTATEMENT OF POLIC REASSURES ALLIES AND PUTS </p><p>THE IRANIAN GOVERNMEN ON THE DEFENSIVE. </p><p> </p><p>17. (S) LOOKING AHEAD -- IRAN AND THE U.S. </p><p>UNDERLYING ALL OF OUR DISCUSSIONSWITH IRANIANS IN THE UAE </p><p>IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT HERE IS NO BIGGER ISSUE IN IRAN </p><p>THAN RELATIONS WTH THE U.S. AT SOME POINT, REGIME </p><p>LEADERS KNOW IALOGUE AND RENEWED RELATIONS ARE </p><p>INEVITABLE. BUT OPINIONS ARE DIVIDED ON HOW AND WHEN THIS </p><p>SHOULD OCCUR. SOME IRANIAN LEADERS FEAR THE VERY ACT OF </p><p>ENGAGING US WILL UNDERMINE THEIR OWN POSITION. BEING </p><p>ANTI-U.S. IS PART OF THE COIN OF REGIME LEGITIMACY. THOSE </p><p>WHO SPEAK OF RENEWED DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH THE U.S. RISK </p><p>TARNISHING THEIR DOMESTIC POLITICAL CREDENTIALS. IT\'S </p><p>LIKE WHAT BEING "SOFT ON COMMUNISM" USED TO BE IN THE U.S. </p><p>ANOTHER CONSIDERATION, ACCORDING TO SOME IRANIAN CONTACTS, </p><p>IS CONCERN ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET THE HIGH </p><p>EXPECTATIONS FOR BETTER TIMES THAT CONTACTS WITH THE U.S. </p><p>WOULD GENERATE -- ESPECIALLY AFTER YEARS OF BLAMING US FOR </p><p>ALL THEIR PROBLEMS. STILL OTHERS, INCLUDING REGIME </p><p>OPPONENTS, BELIEVE THAT RESUMPTION OF RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>U.S. WILL MARK THE FINAL GREENING OF THE REVOLUTION AND </p><p>SIGNAL THAT THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC IS HERE TO STAY. </p><p> </p><p>18. (S) FROM THE IRANIAN REGIME\'S PERSPECTIVE, THE UNITED </p><p>STATES HAS CONTROL OVER THEIR DESTINY. THEY TRULY WORRY </p><p>THAT WE CAN UNSEAT THEM IF WE WISH. EVEN IF THEY </p><p>CALCULATE THAT WE HAVE NO PRESENT INTENTION TO DO SO, THEY </p><p>PROBABLY NURSE FEARS THIS COULD CHANGE, E.G., WITH THE </p><p>RESULTS OF THE KHOBAR INVESTIGATION. THUS, RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE U.S. ARE AS MUCH A DOMESTIC AS A FOREIGN POLICY ISSUE </p><p>FOR IRAN. IT IS ALSO, FOR THIS REGIME, A SENSITIVE </p><p>BORDERLINE SURVIVAL ISSUE--THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>U.S. HAS NO PRESENCE AND LITTLE INFLUENCE IN IRAN. OF </p><p>COURSE, FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW, THIS ABSENCE OF DIRECT </p><p>CONTACTS PUTS US AT A DISADVANTAGE IN BRINGING DIRECT </p><p>PRESSURE TO BEAR TO ADVANCE OUR INTERESTS. THE IRANIANS </p><p>DON\'T SEE IT THIS WAY. </p><p> </p><p>19. (S) FOR ALL THESE REASONS, WE SHOULD EXPECT NO SUDDEN </p><p>MOVE IN RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. KEEPING UP APPEARANCES </p><p>WILL BE A MAJOR CONSIDERATION. WHEN CHANGE COMES, IT WILL </p><p>BE GRADUAL AND POSSIBLY ACCOMPANIED BY EFFORTS TO </p><p>EMPHASIZE IRANIAN INITIATIVES WHILE DOWNPLAYING THE </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE OF ANY STEPS TAKEN. </p><p> </p><p>20. (S) SO, WHAT TO DO? </p><p>IT IS CLEAR FROM OUR CONTACTS THAT THE U.S. EMBARGO HAS </p><p>BEEN A SIGNIFICANT HEADACHE FOR THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT, </p><p>NOTABLY IN DRIVING UP COSTS FOR SOME KEY ITEMS AND IN </p><p>LIMITING ACCESS TO OIL SECTOR INVESTMENT. BUT ON THE </p><p>TRADE SIDE GENERALLY, OUR IRANIAN INTERLOCUTORS CONSIDER </p><p>THE UNILATERAL U.S. EMBARGO MORE IN THE CATEGORY OF A </p><p>NUISANCE THAN A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO BUSINESS. THIS IS </p><p>BECAUSE ITS BROAD GAUGE MAKES THE EMBARGO DIFFICULT TO </p><p>ENFORCE, AND SINCE NO OTHER COUNTRIES SUPPORT IT, U.S. </p><p>IMPORTS CAN USUALLY BE SUBSTITUTED. FOR THEIR PART, </p><p>AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN IN THE UAE ARE GENERALLY SCRUPULOUS </p><p>ABOUT ADHERING CAREFULLY TO U.S. LAW, BUT DISDAINFUL OF </p><p>THE POLICY AS BOTH INEFFECTIVE AND HARMFUL TO U.S. </p><p>COMMERCIAL INTERESTS. IF THE POLICY ACTUALLY WORKED, THEY </p><p>SAY, THEY WOULD BE A LOT MORE SUPPORTIVE, BUT WITH THE </p><p>U.S. ACTING UNILATERALLY THEY SEE THEMSELVES EXCLUDED FROM </p><p>AN IMPORTANT MARKET EVEN AS THEIR COMPETITORS TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE. BOTH IRANIAN AND U.S. BUSINESSMEN WILL BE </p><p>WATCHING TO SEE IF THE FALLOUT FROM THE MYKONOS VERDICT </p><p>LEADS TO MORE COMMON GROUND BETWEEN THE U.S. AND ITS </p><p>ALLIES. </p><p> </p><p>21. (S) THE LIMITS OF ECONOMIC PRESSURE </p><p>THE ISSUE OF WHETHER SANCTIONS WORK OFTEN COMES UP IN </p><p>CONVERSATION HERE. THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF SANCTIONS IS </p><p>FINANCIAL PRESSURE, ESPECIALLY OUR SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO </p><p>LIMIT IRAN\'S ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCING FOR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF ITS OIL/GAS INDUSTRY. BUT WE SHOULD NOT </p><p>FORGET THAT THIS SUCCESS STEMS NOT JUST FROM OUR POLICY </p><p>BUT FROM PRACTICAL FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS. THE 1993 DEBT </p><p>CRISIS DEPRIVED IRAN OF OFFICIALLY-BACKED EXPORT CREDITS </p><p>AS CREDITORS WAITED TO SEE HOW IRAN WOULD MEET THE VARIOUS </p><p>RESCHEDULING OBLIGATIONS NEGOTIATED IN 1994. SO FAR, IT </p><p>HAS DONE SO. </p><p> </p><p>22. (S) IN ADDITION, EVEN IF WE MANAGE TO KEEP THE </p><p>FINANCIAL LID ON, SOME INDUSTRY EXPERTS CAUTION THAT THE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PRESSURE WILL DIMINISH WITH TIME, AT </p><p>LEAST AS FAR AS OIL/GAS DEVELOPMENT GOES. IN THAT REGARD, </p><p>A SENIOR BRITISH PETROLEUM (BP) EXECUTIVE RECENTLY TOOK </p><p>ISSUE WITH CONSUL GENERAL\'S SUGGESTION THAT IRAN WOULD </p><p>INCREASINGLY FEEL THE PINCH OF ITS LIMITED ACCESS TO </p><p>FINANCE FOR OIL/GAS SECTOR DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE READILY AGREED THAT MAJORS LIKE BP MAY STAY OUT </p><p>OF IRAN FOR NOW DUE TO U.S. PRESSURE, HE FELT THE EFFECT </p><p>WOULD BE SHORT-TERM -- NO MORE THAN FIVE YEARS OR SO. AND </p><p>EVEN IF THE MAJORS DO CONTINUE TO STAY OUT LONGER THAN </p><p>THAT DUE TO U.S. PRESSURE -- WHICH HE DOUBTED -- THE </p><p>TECHNOLOGY IS SUCH THAT IT WILL COST IRAN "MUCH LESS THAN </p><p>WE THINK" TO DEVELOP THEIR FIELDS. "IF THEY CAN\'T GET THE </p><p>BIG GUYS," HE SAID, "THEY\'LL BRING IN THE LITTLE GUYS, GET </p><p>SOME THINGS FROM ABROAD, LEARN OTHER THINGS THEMSELVES, </p><p>AND DEVELOP NEW, SMALL-SCALE FIELDS RATHER THAN FIX UP OLD </p><p>LARGE ONES." THE EXECUTIVE NOTED THAT THE IRANIANS ARE </p><p>EXPERT AT DRILLING. IF NECESSARY, HE SAID, THEY\'LL JUST </p><p>SHUT IN SOME FIELDS AND DEVELOP NEW ONES. THAT MEANS THE </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE FINANCIAL SIDE MAY WORK SHORT-TERM, BUT </p><p>NOT FOR LONG. IRAN, HE SAID, WILL BE ABLE TO EXPAND ITS </p><p>PRODUCTION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WITHIN FIVE YEARS, U.S. </p><p>PRESSURE OR NO. </p><p> </p><p>23. (S) THE QUIET HUMILIATION FACTOR </p><p>A FORM OF PRESSURE THAT IS QUITE REAL AND HIGH-IMPACT, IF </p><p>LESS TANGIBLE, IS QUIET HUMILIATION. IT IS FELT WHEN </p><p>IRANIAN CITIZENS AND OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR VISA </p><p>APPLICATIONS REJECTED, WHEN THEY FACE EXTRA SECURITY </p><p>CHECKS WHILE TRAVELING, AND WHEN THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY </p><p>BUYING HIGH-TECH GOODS. AS A NATION WITH A LONG HISTORY </p><p>AND RICH CULTURE, MANY IRANIANS FIND SUCH INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ILL-REPUTE EXTREMELY GALLING. </p><p> </p><p>24. (S) OUTLOOK </p><p>THE CONSENSUS THAT EMERGES FROM OUR IRANIAN CONTACTS IS </p><p>THAT THERE WILL BE NO REGIME CHANGE FOR AT LEAST A DECADE. </p><p>THEY SEE NO CHARISMATIC LEADER TO GALVANIZE OPPOSITION. </p><p>THEY POINT OUT THAT NO ONE WHO REMEMBERS THE LAST </p><p>REVOLUTION HAS ANY APPETITE FOR ANOTHER ONE. WHEN AND IF </p><p>CHANGE COMES, THEY BELIEVE, IT WILL COME FROM THE </p><p>GENERATION THAT GREW UP AFTER THE 1979 REVOLUTION. MOST </p><p>OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOW IN THEIR TEENS AND THE </p><p>PRESSURE FOR CHANGE WILL GROW AS THEY GRADUATE FROM </p><p>COLLEGE, ENTER THE JOB MARKET, AND SEEK HOMES AND SECURITY </p><p>FOR THEIR FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>25. (S) THE LION IN THE CAGE </p><p>ALL THIS POINTS TO LITTLE PROSPECT OF IMMEDIATE POLICY </p><p>CHANGE IN IRAN. THIS DOES NOT IMPLY PRESSURE SHOULD NOT </p><p>BE MAINTAINED; ON THE CONTRARY, PRESSURE IS ESSENTIAL BUT </p><p>SHOULD BE FOCUSED IN ORDER TO HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT. </p><p>THE IRANIAN REGIME, HOWEVER RESISTANT TO PRESSURE IT MAY </p><p>BE IN SOME AREAS, ALSO HAS REAL WEAKNESSES. SANCTIONS ARE </p><p>THEREFORE AN IMPORTANT ADJUNCT OF POLICY, IF NOT A POLICY </p><p>IN THEMSELVES. OUR CONTACTS CONCLUDE THAT THE REGIME </p><p>MIGHT BE OPEN TO CHANGE, BUT WILL NEVER GIVE THE </p><p>APPEARANCE OF SUCH. ANY TURNAROUND ON KEY ISSUES WILL BE </p><p>INCREMENTAL, AND POSSIBLY EVEN DISGUISED BY A FEINT IN THE </p><p>OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO DEMONSTRATE INDEPENDENCE. IN </p><p>EFFECT, THE U.S. HAS ATTEMPTED TO DESIGN A CAGE OF </p><p>SANCTIONS AND PRESSURE TO CONTAIN IRAN. BUT THERE IS </p><p>LITTLE POINT IN KEEPING THE PERSIAN LION IN A CAGE AND </p><p>JUST PRODDING HIM, GETTING HIM MADDER AND MADDER. IT DOES </p><p>NOT FOLLOW THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO PRODDING, BUT RATHER </p><p>THAT, AT SOME POINT, THE DOOR TO THE CAGE MUST BE OPENED </p><p>SO THE LION KNOWS WHICH WAY TO GO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LITT </p><p></p></div>
