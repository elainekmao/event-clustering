MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  02-20-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, PTER, ASEC, CE, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  Iraq:  FM reaffirms constructive position; </p><p>Ambassador expresses concerns re Iraqi embassy officials </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 278 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 273 </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 170, and previous (All Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF) The Ambassador met with Sri Lankan Foreign </p><p>Minister Tyronne Fernando on February 20.  The </p><p>conversation focused on the Iraq situation.  When </p><p>queried, the Foreign Minister confirmed that Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>position on the situation remained unchanged from the </p><p>MFA\'s previous public statement on the matter.  (Note: </p><p>This statement, which was quite constructive, was issued </p><p>January 28 -- see Ref C.)  He noted that he would be </p><p>restating the GSL\'s position in a parliamentary debate </p><p>on the Iraq situation taking place later that day </p><p>(February 20).  The core of the GSL position, he </p><p>stressed, was that Iraq must comply immediately with all </p><p>UN resolutions.  He added that he hoped that war could </p><p>be avoided if at all possible.  The Ambassador said the </p><p>U.S. also hoped to avoid war, but Iraq could not defy </p><p>the UN and had to do more.  The Ambassador provided the </p><p>FM with a copy of Secretary Powell\'s February 14 remarks </p><p>to the UN Security Council.  (Note:  The text of these </p><p>remarks was also provided to the MFA on February 17, per </p><p>Ref A.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Switching gears, the Ambassador emphasized </p><p>our concerns about the recent activities of Iraqi </p><p>embassy officials.  The Ambassador noted that at least </p><p>three of these officials were known intelligence </p><p>officers.  Some of them had turned up at recent anti- </p><p>U.S. rallies.  In addition, there was evidence that one </p><p>Iraqi official had provided money to fund a recent anti- </p><p>U.S. demonstration (See Ref B for further information). </p><p>GSL intelligence agencies also knew of these activities. </p><p>We were not asking the Sri Lankan government to expel </p><p>the Iraqis at this time, although we might do so at a </p><p>later date if such activities continued.  We requested, </p><p>however, that the Sri Lankan government call in the </p><p>Iraqi Charge, and demand that he and his staff honor the </p><p>"third country rule."  It was vital for the security of </p><p>the U.S. Embassy and its personnel that Iraqi officials </p><p>not be allowed to violate their official status. </p><p>Listening carefully and nodding, the FM took the </p><p>Ambassador\'s points on board. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) COMMENT:  Foreign Minister Fernando, who is </p><p>friendly to the U.S., seemed sympathetic to our </p><p>concerns.  He made no commitments regarding the Iraqi </p><p>embassy\'s activities, but our guess is that he will look </p><p>into the matter as soon as possible.  At the close of </p><p>the meeting, he repeated his long-standing interest in </p><p>becoming the next UN Secretary General.  Despite </p><p>reports, he seemed relatively hail-and-hearty after </p><p>recent heart-related surgery.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
