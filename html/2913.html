<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000917 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SEPT FOR INR/R, R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA, SA/PD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: Media Reaction: Nepal\'s Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba\'s visit to U.S </p><p> </p><p>1. "Bush pledges military, economic aid to Nepal; Deuba jubilant" </p><p> </p><p>Article, "Kathmandu Post" (E/D, 5/9): "The United States has </p><p>pledged vital support to make Nepal\'s democracy more vibrant with </p><p>special emphasis on effective anti terrorist measures, peace and </p><p>security of the Himalayan Kingdon.  The outcome of...the meeting </p><p>Prime Minister Deuba had with President Bush...was more or less on </p><p>the expected line and America\'s long term interest to be a partner </p><p>in Nepal\'s peace progress and democratic exercise more visible </p><p>than ever before..." </p><p> </p><p>2.  "U.S. extends full support" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, "Space Time Today" (E/D, 5/9): "There seems to have </p><p>been no specific areas in which assurance of U.S. assistance for </p><p>resolving the insurgency was made during the meeting... Another </p><p>noteworthy feature of Deuba\'s talks with Bush is that little </p><p>emphasis has been placed on increasing American development </p><p>assistance to Nepal... Prime Minister Deuba...will also meet the </p><p>British Prime Minister.  Deuba is undertaking his visits abroad </p><p>with the express purpose of seeking further foreign military </p><p>assistance at a time when the general public opinion and the views </p><p>of responsible political forces, including sections of the ruling </p><p>party, are inclining towards resolving the insurgency issue </p><p>through the negotiating table.  Deuba, nevertheless, is apparently </p><p>acting oblivious to such voices..." </p><p> </p><p>3. "Fruitful Talks" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, "Rising Nepal" (E/D, 5/9): "...The U.S. has been a </p><p>great friend of Nepal.  The U.S. government\'s willingness to </p><p>support Nepal in its fight against Maoist terrorists is very </p><p>significant... The U.S. government\'s recent announcement of an </p><p>assistance package to Nepal further underlined the importance it </p><p>attaches to consolidating Nepal\'s multi-party democracy and </p><p>development activities...  President Bush\'s assurance of continued </p><p>support to Nepal\'s fight against the terrorism and strengthening </p><p>and safeguarding democracy indicates that the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>U.S. visit is absolutely successful..." </p><p> </p><p>4. "Deuba-Bush Talks" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, "Gorkhapatra" (V/D, 5/9): "...America appears to be </p><p>committed to helping Nepal to fight against terrorism... The talks </p><p>have satisfied the expectations of Nepalis who have want to </p><p>protect democracy and human rights in their country..." </p><p> </p><p>5. "Prime Minister\'s America visit" </p><p> </p><p>Article, "Jwala" (Pro-Maoist, V/W, 5/9): Deuba\'s America visit, at </p><p>a time when leaders and party workers of the Nepali Congress and </p><p>the major opposition parties, human rights organizations and civic </p><p>society have called for dialogue to resolve the Maoist problem, </p><p>has not pleased anyone... Nepal is a sovereign country. </p><p>Foreigners are looking for every excuse to introduce their </p><p>military bases.  If foreigners get an opportunity to enter Nepal </p><p>in the name of controlling terrorism, Nepal\'s sovereignty might be </p><p>put in danger... America killed thousands of Afghans in a futile </p><p>attempt to find Osama bin Laden.  It cannot be denied that Nepal </p><p>will encounter a similar situation if America begins to hunt </p><p>Prachanda and Baburam [Top Maoist leaders]." </p><p> </p><p>6. "Deuba\'s U.S. visit" </p><p> </p><p>Op-ed, "Himalayan Times" (E/D, 5/9): "...This [Deuba-Bush meeting] </p><p>is indicative of the importance attached by the U.S. to Nepal in </p><p>its campaign to fight terrorism.  The United States has stated </p><p>that it is not seeking permanent military bases in South Asia. </p><p>Although the final report of the American needs assessment mission </p><p>to Nepal, which will determine the kind of military aid to Nepal, </p><p>will not be known for some time, it is unlikely that American </p><p>bases will be established in Nepal or American soldiers will fight </p><p>the war against the Maoists.  The most likely assistance will be </p><p>in the form of equipment and training... Both India and China will </p><p>be watching the American military aid to Nepal with keen interest" </p><p> </p><p>7. "Achievements should not be undermined by difference" </p><p> </p><p>Article, People\'s Reveiew (E/W, 5/9): "...The meting with </p><p>President Bush is a major feather in the cap of beleaguered Prime </p><p>Minister Deuba, who is facing opposition from not only the </p><p>opposition parties back home, but from some of his own partymen, </p><p>including former Prime Minister and President of the Nepali </p><p>Congress Party Girija Prasad Koirala... With help from the USA and </p><p>other Western countries, the army could probably quell the </p><p>terrorism problem faster..." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "Questions raised by Prime Minister\'s U.S. visit" </p><p> </p><p>Op-ed, "Spacetime Dainik" (V/D, 5/8): "Declaring emergency in the </p><p>country, Prime Minister Deuba has been in various cities of the </p><p>U.S. for over a week for no reason.  The Deubas\' visit rather </p><p>looks like those of the honeymooners.  This has shown how </p><p>irresponsible and thoughtless the Prime Minister is to the country </p><p>and people.  The country has suffered an unbelievable loss over </p><p>the last ten months of Deuba\'s governance..." </p><p> </p><p>9. "Prime Minister\'s America visit" </p><p> </p><p>Op-ed by Nepal\'s former Foreign Minister Shailendra Kumar </p><p>Upadhayay, "Rajdhani" (V/D, 5/8): "...The Prime Minister\'s America </p><p>visit will definitely be successful in terms of controlling the </p><p>terrorist activities [in Nepal].  In the backdrop of the worldwide </p><p>campaign against terrorism, the Nepal-U.S. relationship has taken </p><p>a new course.  Secretary Powell\'s visit to Nepal further </p><p>heightened the relationship.  It can be hoped that Prime Minister </p><p>Deuba\'s America visit will further strengthen the Nepal-U.S. </p><p>relationship and improve mutual understanding..." </p><p> </p><p>10. "Successful Meeting" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, "Himalaya Times" (V/D, 5/8): "The meeting of Prime </p><p>Minister Deuba with President Bush, the leader of the most </p><p>prosperous country in the world, is a matter of excitement and </p><p>satisfaction.  America has helped Nepal in many areas, including </p><p>education, agriculture and technology... Nepal and America both </p><p>are fighting terrorism now.  We are in a serious need of foreign </p><p>economic assistance as the Maoist attacks have destroyed many of </p><p>our physical infrastructures.  The Deuba visit is expected to make </p><p>necessary endeavors in this regard..." </p><p> </p><p>11. "Bush-Deuba talks" </p><p> </p><p>Article, RSS (National News Agency) news carried by several of </p><p>Nepal\'s prominent newspapers: "Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba </p><p>has expressed gratitude for the clear expression of support </p><p>extended by the United States of America to Nepal as Nepal makes </p><p>determined efforts to combat terror..." </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
