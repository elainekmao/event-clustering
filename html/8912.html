<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 002984 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/NGA AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/21/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAEG SEEKS CONFIRMATION ON IRAQI MFA </p><p>FAX AUTHORIZING DISTRIBUTION OF TRAVEL </p><p>FUNDS FOR FORMER IRAQI DIPLOMATS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ABU DHABI 2896 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) This is an action request; see para 5. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) UAE MFA Assistant U/S for Political Affairs </p><p>Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuaimi contacted the Ambassador </p><p>June 21 seeking confirmation on a fax sent to the </p><p>Iraqi "embassy" in Abu Dhabi from the MFA Steering </p><p>Committee in Baghdad.  The UAEG took over control </p><p>of the Iraqi embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Iraqi </p><p>consulate in Dubai in the beginning of June and </p><p>froze all of the missions\' assets.  Abdullah Rashid </p><p>said embassy staff had received a fax dated June 2 </p><p>from an Ambassador Ghassan Mohsen Hussein, head of </p><p>the MFA Steering Committee in Baghdad issuing </p><p>instructions for the issuance of tickets and the </p><p>distribution of travel monies to former Iraqi </p><p>diplomats and their families.  Upon the </p><p>Ambassador\'s request, Abdullah Rashid forwarded a </p><p>copy of the fax to the Embassy.  The fax requests </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Issuance of tickets to former diplomats and </p><p>their families to travel back to Baghdad via Amman </p><p>or Damascus with the provision of a $20 travel </p><p>allowance per family member. </p><p> </p><p>-- Agreement to continuing paying those staff </p><p>members covered by the 16 March memorandum (a copy </p><p>of which was also attached and which was addressed </p><p>to a former Iraqi diplomat in Dubai -- Humaid </p><p>Khaled Salman). </p><p> </p><p>Abdullah Rashid told the Ambassador the UAEG was </p><p>not/not prepared to act on these matters and open </p><p>the bank accounts for issuance of travel tickets </p><p>and allowances absent confirmation from the USG </p><p>that the fax from the MFA Steering Committee is </p><p>legitimate. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Abdullah Rashid asked the Ambassador whether </p><p>any decision had been taken on the resumption of </p><p>consular services.  The local Iraqi staff at the </p><p>Embassy in Abu Dhabi have requested that they be </p><p>allowed to resume these services.  They have </p><p>apparently told the Emiratis that their </p><p>counterparts in Doha and Amman have resumed these </p><p>services.  Abdullah Rashid noted the difficulties </p><p>encountered by the UAEG as a result of the lack of </p><p>Iraqi consular services here.  While the UAEG is </p><p>being lenient on residency issues, the inability of </p><p>Iraqis to travel overseas because their passports </p><p>have expired is a significant hardship.  He related </p><p>that an Iraqi woman in dire need of sophisticated </p><p>medical attention had died in the UAE recently </p><p>because she was unable to travel abroad to receive </p><p>attention.  The Ambassador said we were awaiting </p><p>guidance on the broad subject of consular services </p><p>but in the immediate term, we appreciate the UAEG\'s </p><p>not penalizing Iraqis with expired passports </p><p>seeking to renew their residency status. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ACTION REQUEST:  Please provide guidance on </p><p>both the matter of releasing frozen Iraqi funds for </p><p>Iraqi "diplomats" as well as on the broader issue </p><p>of the resumption of consular services.  As we </p><p>noted last week (reftel), this issue continues to </p><p>simmer here and we expect telephone calls and walk- </p><p>ins to continue as long as Iraqi are unable to </p><p>obtain assistance from their embassy. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
