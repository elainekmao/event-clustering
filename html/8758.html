<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 001211 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: YORUBA LEADER PA ADESANYA\'S VIEWS ON </p><p>STATUS OF AD, AFENIFERE, YCE, AND US-NIGERIAN RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary. Leader of Afenifere and member of the </p><p>Patriot\'s group, Pa Abraham Adesanya, says that the April </p><p>elections must be canceled and an interim government </p><p>installed until "free and fair" elections can be held. He </p><p>claims Afenifere is not seriously weakened after the defeat </p><p>of many Alliance for Democracy (AD) candidates in the </p><p>elections, and that the organization will continue to promote </p><p>the political issues that concern Yorubas.  Adesanya defends </p><p>Afenifere as the true mouthpiece of Yoruba political </p><p>aspirations and stoutly denies that any other group, </p><p>including the rival Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), can </p><p>adequately represent pan-Yoruba interests.  Adesanya\'s </p><p>claims notwithstanding, the elections gave both Afenifere and </p><p>the AD a jarring blow.  With the Peoples Democratic Party </p><p>(PDP) having swept the Southwest, President Obasanjo has </p><p>emerged as the preeminent Yoruba politician, casting a large </p><p>shadow over territory that, until April, seemed like the </p><p>exclusive domain of Afenifere and the AD.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>The Patriots propose five-year term limits...again </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On May 23, a group of prominent, mostly Southern, </p><p>Nigerians, the "Patriots", issued a press statement calling </p><p>for Nigerians to reject the results of the April 19 </p><p>Presidential and National Assembly elections.  The statement </p><p>contended that the elections were so riddled with </p><p>irregularities that a government based on such fraud would be </p><p>"a disservice to democracy."  The group called for a one-year </p><p>interim government comprised of political party </p><p>representatives and "other interested groups" that would rule </p><p>Nigeria until "free and fair" elections would be held. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Afenifere is not dead, not even wounded </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) PolOff met with Chief Pa Abraham Adesanya, head of </p><p>Afenifere (pan-Yoruba social and cultural organization), </p><p>member of the Patriots, former Senator from Ogun State, and </p><p>among the leaders who formed the AD party.  The octogenerian </p><p>Adesanya asked for a meeting at his home, as he was </p><p>recovering from an illness and under doctor\'s orders to "get </p><p>some rest." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Adesanya adamantly rejected the prevailing verdict </p><p>that Afenifere had lost its clout in the southwest after the </p><p>defeat in the April/May elections of almost all AD </p><p>candidates.  According to Adesanya, Afenifere, is and will be </p><p>the only organization to pursue issues of concern to Yorubas </p><p>worldwide.  He also rejected the notion that AD is a party </p><p>for Yorubas and the southwest States only and pointed out </p><p>that the party has other objectives in different parts of the </p><p>country and for different constituencies.  He noted the facts </p><p>that AD had fielded opposition candidates in the Hausa north </p><p>as well as the Igbo southeast, and that the Igbo candidate, </p><p>Chief Nnanna Uzor Kalu, was one of the few AD winners.  As </p><p>for the notion that the elections revealed Afenifere as a </p><p>moribund organization for old Yoruba men, Adesanya declared </p><p>that any Yoruba, male or female, young or old, could join </p><p>Afenifere.  (Comment. Adesanya\'s statements that Afenifere </p><p>has an open membership and a pan-Yoruba scope may be true. </p><p>However, a harder truth was that Afenifere and the AD were </p><p>routed by the PDP in this last election.  Additionally, the </p><p>criticism from the Southwest about electoral irregularities </p><p>has, so far, been mild relative to the decibels heard from </p><p>the Northwest and Southeast.  Afenifere and the AD have not </p><p>even been able to marshall enough strength to complain </p><p>vigorously. This is not only a sign of weakness of both </p><p>groups, but also an acceptance of the election results in the </p><p>Southwest.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Liars, traitors and the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Adesanya became even more acerbic when asked about </p><p>the relationship among the AD, Afenifere and the YCE.  He </p><p>said that the YCE is comprised of disgruntled Afenifere </p><p>members who "crawled away" in opposition to his being named </p><p>leader.  He continued, saying that the YCE is not really made </p><p>up of Yoruba "elders", and has an age threshold of sixty for </p><p>membership that it does not strictly impose. "Some of their </p><p>members are in their fifties and even their forties,"  he </p><p>complained.  According to Adesanya, he was lied to by a </p><p>founding member of the YCE, Judge Adewale Thompson.  Adesanya </p><p>says he met with Thompson when the first rumors were </p><p>circulating that a break-away group was forming.  He says </p><p>that Thompson assured him that no such group would be formed. </p><p> He asserted that elderly founding members of Afenifere </p><p>(notably ninety-year old Anglican Archdeacon Pa Emmanuel </p><p>Alayande) were "tricked" into supporting the YCE.  Adesanya </p><p>is totally opposed to a multiplicity of groups representing </p><p>the Yoruba, saying the "selfish traitors" of the YCE will </p><p>only bring "trouble into the fold of the Yoruba." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) (Comment. The YCE was among the first to criticize the </p><p>Patriots\' interim government proposal.  In a statement to the </p><p>Guardian newspaper, a YCE spokesman called the Patriots plan </p><p>"an invitation to anarchy."  The spokesman also said that the </p><p>YCE considered the April/May elections "the freest and </p><p>fairest in the history of Nigeria."  The YCE position is not </p><p>surprising. The organization is the brainchild of late </p><p>Attorney General Bola Ige.  Since Ige\'s demise, President </p><p>Obasanjo and his allies have progressively taken control of </p><p>the YCE.  Now the YCE, backed by the weight of the President </p><p>and by PDP electoral gains in the Southwest, is ready to </p><p>challenge Afenifere for the mantle of the preeminent Yoruba </p><p>organization. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>The "so-called" elections and US-Nigerian relations </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Seeming to gain more energy with each new topic, </p><p>Adesanya asked PolOff how the US could congratulate the GON </p><p>on an obviously rigged election and continue relations with </p><p>any government formed by fraud.  PolOff informed him that US </p><p>Mission goals in Nigeria included supporting stable political </p><p>and economic growth for Nigeria, and that the USG had </p><p>congratulated only the Nigerian people on conducting the </p><p>elections and on the transition from one civilian government </p><p>to a successor without the military interventions and </p><p>violence of the past.  Adesanya retorted that his complaint </p><p>against the US was that "your economy and trade are placed </p><p>above anything else."  He continued, saying "I take all your </p><p>promises and pronouncements with a grain of salt, because I </p><p>know you are prepared to sacrifice us before your trade." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Adesanya said he met with President Olusegun Obasanjo </p><p>before the elections in April and had promised that the </p><p>Southwest would be peaceful. He also promised Afenifere and </p><p>AD support for Obasanjo, a Yoruba.  Adesanya said that, </p><p>because of his pact with Obasanjo, Yorubas did not protest </p><p>election irregularities, implying that it was he, not </p><p>Obasanjo\'s power and influence, that staved off unrest in </p><p>the Southwest.  He added that AD National Chairman Alhaji </p><p>Ahmed Adamu Abdulkadir, who had at first endorsed the results </p><p>of the elections then recanted, was unable to speak for the </p><p>Yorubas.  He said Afenifere had opposed Abdulkadir\'s </p><p>appointment from the very beginning because Abdulkadir was </p><p>not a member of any of the founding organizations of the </p><p>party.  Abdulkadir was "surreptitiously" brought in by a </p><p>group of "traitors" and Adesanya refuses to accept him as </p><p>Chairman of AD.  He added that Afenifere will not support any </p><p>"new" AD party led by Abdulkadir. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment. Adesanya has been a prominent politician for </p><p>decades.  He is respected as an elder statesman by Yorubas </p><p>and non-Yorubas.  His views have in the past and will </p><p>continue to have influence in the Southwest.  However, that </p><p>influence may be on the wane thanks to the elections that put </p><p>Obasanjo, the PDP and the YCE in a more advantageous position </p><p>in the Southwest.  For many observers, Pa Adesanya </p><p>personifies what may be a problem with Afenifere and what led </p><p>to the AD\'s electoral meltdown--that it is controlled by </p><p>octogenarians, out of touch with the younger generation of </p><p>Yorubas who would rather support a Yoruba already in power </p><p>than someone who is more ethno-centric but has no chance at </p><p>national power.  Despite Pa\'s protestations that Afenifere </p><p>and the AD are not ailing, President Obasanjo now casts a </p><p>formidable shadow over the Southwestern real estate the two </p><p>groups once controlled. End comment. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
