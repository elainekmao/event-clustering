<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 OTTAWA 000723 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HOMELAND SECURITY FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KPLS, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS02,  CA </p><p>SUBJECT:  DISTANT NEIGHBORS, NORTHERN STYLE: CANADIAN </p><p>OPINION OF THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary and Conclusion. International debate on the war </p><p>on terrorism and impending war in Iraq has raised serious </p><p>concern about "What the World Thinks" about the United </p><p>States and its foreign policies.  This is as true for Canada </p><p>as for the rest of the world.  Canada is our largest trading </p><p>partner; shares our longest land border; and has been a </p><p>close ally in two world wars, the Cold War and in the war on </p><p>terrorism.  Implementation of new security measures post 9- </p><p>11, such as NSEERS and visa requirements for Commonwealth </p><p>Landed Immigrants in Canada, as well as perennial bilateral </p><p>trade issues, have given us additional reason to ask how </p><p>Canadians perceive us. </p><p> </p><p>2. This is the first in a series of cables that attempts to </p><p>assess Canadian opinion of the U.S. and public support in </p><p>Canada for U.S. policies.  This report reviews the findings </p><p>of three recent, publicly released Canadian public opinion </p><p>polls.  These polls indicate that we still enjoy a reservoir </p><p>of good will with most Canadians.  But the polls also </p><p>indicate that the international environment post 9-11 has </p><p>drawn heavily on that good will.  The U.S. has a broad and </p><p>complex policy agenda in which Canadian opinion matters. </p><p>The opinion polling results suggest that, as we implement </p><p>our policy agenda, we will need to find ways effectively to </p><p>shore up public support from our nearest neighbors.  End </p><p>Summary and Conclusion. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ: CANADIAN VIEWS ARE MIXED BUT GENERALLY SUPPORT </p><p>MILITARY ACTION ONLY IF SANCTIONED BY THE UN. </p><p> </p><p>3. The most recent publicly released national poll was </p><p>conducted by the firm Ipsos-Reid on February 28 2003.  It </p><p>finds a slim majority (51 percent) of Canadians saying that </p><p>the UN Security Council has enough evidence to authorize </p><p>military action against Iraq.  This is a small but </p><p>significant shift from a poll conducted 10 days earlier in </p><p>which 52 percent of Canadians said that there was not enough </p><p>evidence to authorize an attack. </p><p> </p><p>4. This does not mean that a majority of Canadians support </p><p>the U.S. position on Iraq.  62 per cent of Canadians in the </p><p>Feb 28 survey continue to believe that Canada should support </p><p>more time for UN inspectors in Iraq to complete their </p><p>mission.  62 percent of Canadians also say that Canada </p><p>should provide assistance for military action in Iraq only </p><p>if the UN decides military action is required. </p><p> </p><p>5. Only 32 percent of Canadians feel Canada should support </p><p>U.S. and U.K. calls for immediate military action to remove </p><p>Saddam Hussein from power.  Even fewer - 18 percent - say </p><p>that Canada should provide military assistance if the U.S. </p><p>decides that military action is required in Iraq without UN </p><p>authorization.  Another 18 percent of Canadians feel that </p><p>Canada should provide no military assistance for any action </p><p>in Iraq, even if authorized by the UN. </p><p> </p><p>REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN CANADIAN PERCEPTIONS </p><p> </p><p>6. Canada\'s regions exhibit differing patterns of support </p><p>for the U.S. position on Iraq.  The view that the UN </p><p>Security Council now has enough evidence to authorize </p><p>military action against Iraq is shared by at least half of </p><p>the residents in each region except in Quebec, where only 34 </p><p>percent of Canadians hold this view.  When Quebec is removed </p><p>from the national polling, agreement among Canadians rises </p><p>to 57 percent. </p><p> </p><p>7. Of all Canadians, Albertans exhibit the highest level of </p><p>support; 70 percent believe the UN has sufficient evidence </p><p>to authorize military action.  Other western Canadians, </p><p>however, are more strongly opposed.  In Saskatchewan and </p><p>Manitoba, 67 percent (up from 53 percent in the earlier </p><p>poll) now say that Canada should support more time for UN </p><p>inspectors.  Only 28 percent (down from 42 percent in the </p><p>earlier poll) say that Canada should support the U.S./U.K. </p><p>position on the need for military action in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>A BASELINE OF CANADIAN OPINION OF THE U.S. - THE PEW CENTER </p><p>STUDY. </p><p> </p><p>8. The Pew Center Study, published at the end of 2002, has </p><p>been widely discussed in U.S. and foreign media, including </p><p>the media in Canada.  The study received relatively little </p><p>attention on a country-by-country basis, however.  The </p><p>Study, conducted in July 2002, shows that Canadians hold </p><p>positive attitudes about the U.S.  At 72 percent favorable, </p><p>Canadians held a more positive image of the U.S. than almost </p><p>any other country (among traditional allies, only the U.K. </p><p>was more positive at 75 percent).  That rating by Canadians </p><p>was up one percentage point, from 71 percent, in the </p><p>previous year\'s survey. </p><p> </p><p>9. The Pew Center Study also indicates that Canadians and </p><p>Americans are alike in many of their national perceptions. </p><p>They express remarkably similar satisfaction with their own </p><p>lives.  67 percent of Canadians and 64 per cent of Americans </p><p>are satisfied with their personal lives, far higher levels </p><p>of satisfaction than in other industrialized western </p><p>nations.  Canadians and Americans also express similar views </p><p>of "progress" in their countries over the past five years </p><p>(51 percent among Americans, 48 percent among Canadians). </p><p>And they express similar levels of "optimism" about the </p><p>future (61 per cent among Americans and 54 per cent among </p><p>Canadians).  Americans and Canadians are significantly more </p><p>optimistic about the future than are western Europeans. </p><p> </p><p>10. Yet there are significant differences in American and </p><p>Canadian perceptions of specific issue areas on the world </p><p>scene.  50 percent of Americans identify terrorism as a </p><p>"very big" problem; only 19 percent of Canadians expressed </p><p>that concern.  The Pew Study found a duality of opinion </p><p>among the U.S.\' closest allies in their support for the war </p><p>against terrorism.  Canadian opinion fits that pattern: 68 </p><p>per cent of Canadians supported the U.S. led war on </p><p>terrorism; but only 25 percent of Canadians believed that </p><p>U.S. foreign policy "considers others" when making </p><p>international policy decisions, including decisions about </p><p>countering international terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>11. Canadians are critical of the U.S. in the economic </p><p>sphere.  68 percent of Canadians believe that the U.S. does </p><p>"too little to solve problems related to the gap between </p><p>rich and poor countries." On issues of pollution and the </p><p>environment, nearly twice as many Canadians as Americans are </p><p>"worried" (44 per cent vs. 23 per cent).  While 50 percent </p><p>of Canadians like "American ideas about democracy," 56 </p><p>percent of Canadians dislike "American ideas about business </p><p>practices." </p><p> </p><p>12. Canadians have mixed views of U.S. cultural influence </p><p>but they are far less critical than Europeans.  54 per cent </p><p>of Canadians expressed the sentiment that the "spread of </p><p>American ideas and customs" was bad.  This compares with 71 </p><p>percent in France, 67 percent in Germany and 68 percent in </p><p>Russia.  Yet 77 percent of Canadians "like" American popular </p><p>culture.  This compares with 66 percent in France and </p><p>Germany and only 42 percent in Russia. </p><p> </p><p>13. Among western countries, only in Canada does a strong </p><p>majority (77 per cent) express a positive view of </p><p>immigration.  Among other major industrial countries, </p><p>Americans show the next highest level of support for </p><p>immigration; but at 49 percent, American support for </p><p>immigration is far lower than Canadian. </p><p> </p><p>CANADIAN OPINION UPDATE: A NEGATIVE SHIFT? </p><p> </p><p>14. The Pew Center in Canada was conducted by the Environics </p><p>Research Group in July, 2002.  The same firm conducted a </p><p>separate poll with a different set of respondents in </p><p>February 2003.  The two polls were not designed to be </p><p>strictly inter-comparable.  Nevertheless, the findings of </p><p>the later poll may suggest a negative shift in Canadian </p><p>perceptions of the U.S.  The overall Canadian attitude </p><p>toward the U.S. remained favorable.  But at 62 percent, it </p><p>was considerably lower than in August 2002. </p><p>A majority of Quebecers - 54 per cent - for the first time </p><p>held an unfavorable opinion of the U.S., a 20 percent drop </p><p>since August 2002. </p><p> </p><p>15. The polling data from Quebec suggests that, despite the </p><p>decline of separatism as a political issue, there is still a </p><p>significant anglophone/francophone division of opinion on </p><p>international issues.  This is particularly interesting as </p><p>Quebecers often have been viewed as more pro-American than </p><p>other Canadians - particularly in Ontario - because of wide </p><p>support for free trade and American culture.  In another </p><p>twist, the latest poll finds Canadians overall holding more </p><p>positive views of both the U.K. and France than of the U.S. </p><p>77 percent of Canadians hold a favorable view of the U.K. </p><p>compared to 69 percent for France and 62 percent for the </p><p>U.S.  The favorable rating for France in Quebec was 80 </p><p>percent compared with 62 percent for the U.K. and 40 percent </p><p>for the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>16. COMMENT. These polling results indicate that Canadian </p><p>perceptions of the U.S. are mixed and dynamic, and that they </p><p>exhibit significant regional differences.  Future cables </p><p>will attempt to assess more anecdotally the extent to which </p><p>Canadian perceptions may reflect deeper sentiments in favor </p><p>of peace and in favor of multi-lateral action; and the </p><p>extent to which such sentiments may translate into "anti- </p><p>American" feelings.  END COMMENT.  Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
