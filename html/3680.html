<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 004398 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S-CKELLY, EUR/WE-MENNUTI NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, IZ, IS, terrorism </p><p>SUBJECT: ONE YEAR AFTER SEPTEMBER 11:  HOLY SEE FM WELCOMES </p><p>GLOBAL CONDEMNATION OF TERROR; CAUTIONS AGAINST ACTION IN </p><p>IRAQ WITHOUT U.N. </p><p> </p><p>REF: VATICAN 4388 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04398  01 OF 02  110710Z </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 10, </p><p>VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN LOUIS TAURAN PRAISED THE </p><p>UNIVERSAL CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM THAT HAS FOLLOWED </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, WHILE CAUTIONING THAT ANY DECISION TO USE FORCE </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ MUST BE TAKEN WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS.  HE OBSERVED THAT ACTION AGAINST IRAQ MUST BE </p><p>WEIGHED AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ, </p><p>COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, AND GLOBAL STABILITY, BUT DID NOT </p><p>RULE OUT MILITARY ACTION IF IT OCCURED IN A UN FRAMEWORK.  IN </p><p>HIS STRONGEST WARNING, TAURAN STATED THAT "ONE CANNOT COMBAT </p><p>EVIL WITH ANOTHER EVIL, ADDING EVIL TO EVIL." TAURAN POINTED </p><p>TO THE POPE\'S DAY OF PRAYER FOR PEACE IN ASSISI AND HIS </p><p>EFFORTS TO PROMOTE INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE AS HELPING TO </p><p>SPREAD THE VIEW THAT RELIGION SHOULD NEVER BE USED TO JUSTIFY </p><p>VIOLENCE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>GOODNESS FROM EVIL </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW PUBLISHED ON THE EVE OF </p><p>THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS, HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINSTER </p><p>JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN PROVIDED A BROAD ASSESSMENT OF THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S VIEW OF THE POST-SEPTEMBER 11 INTERNATIONAL LANDSCAPE, </p><p>ENCOMPASSING THE WAR ON TERRORISM, THE SITUATION IN IRAQ, THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, AND RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND THE </p><p>MUSLIM WORLD.  LOOKING BACK ON SEPTEMBER 11, TAURAN SAID THE </p><p>"ABOMINABLE ACTION" HAD LED TO THREE IMPORTANT CHANGES IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ATTITUDES:  FIRST, IT HAD LED TO A UNIVERSAL </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM; SECOND, IT HAD CONTRIBUTED TO </p><p>BETTER JURIDICAL DEFINITIONS OF TERRORISM; AND THIRD, IT HAD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04398  01 OF 02  110710Z </p><p>HELPED FOCUS INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION ON THE CAUSES OF </p><p>INHUMANE VIOLENCE.  FURTHERMORE, TAURAN ASSERTED THAT </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 HAD STRENGTHENED THE RECOGNITION AMONG LEADERS </p><p>OF ALL FAITHS AND NATIONS THAT "RELIGION CAN NEVER BE USED TO </p><p>JUSTIFY TERRORISM AND THAT ALL BELIEVERS HAVE THE COMMON </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO DISARM HATRED."  HE NOTED THAT THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN A CHORUS OVER THE PAST YEAR AMONG BELIEVERS OF ALL </p><p>FAITHS -- PARTICULARLY CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS, AND JEWS -- THAT </p><p>LIFE IS SACRED AND COMES FROM GOD.  AS A RESULT, RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERS HAVE STEPPED UP EFFORTS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ALL </p><p>VIOLENCE IS CONTRARY TO GOD\'S LAW, AND MUST BE RESOLVED </p><p>THROUGH DIALOGUE AND JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>DON\'T ISOLATE IRAQ </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) TURNING TO IRAQ, TAURAN EXPRESSED THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF MILITARY ACTION, BUT, </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY, LEFT THE DOOR OPEN TO THE USE OF FORCE IF IT </p><p>OCCURRED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE UNITED NATIONS.  TAURAN </p><p>OBSERVED THAT THE HOLY SEE ALWAYS FAVORED DIALOGUE, AND </p><p>CAUTIONED AGAINST ISOLATING IRAQ.  "OBVIOUSLY, YOU CANNOT </p><p>COMBAT EVIL WITH ANOTHER EVIL, HEAPING EVIL UPON EVIL," </p><p>TAURAN STATED, QUOTING FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S "JUST WAR" </p><p>DOCTRINE.  HOWEVER, TAURAN CONTINUED, "IF REFLECTING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW AND IN PARTICULAR RESOLUTIONS OF THE UN </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY JUDGES IT </p><p>OPPORTUNE TO RESORT TO PROPORTIONATE USE OF FORCE, SUCH AN </p><p>ACTION MUST TAKE PLACE WITH A DECISION TAKEN BY THE UN, AFTER </p><p>HAVING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE CIVIL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04398  01 OF 02  110710Z </p><p>POPULATION OF IRAQ, COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, AND GLOBAL </p><p>STABILITY."  ULTIMATELY, HE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE TYPE OF </p><p>OPERATIONS NOW BEING CONSIDERED WOULD GIVE RISE TO LASTING </p><p>PEACE, ADDING, "WE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO CONFUSE JUSTICE </p><p>WITH VENDETTA AND ENSURE THAT ENTIRE POPULATIONS DO NOT PAY </p><p>FOR THE CRUELTY OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR ATTACKS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>FIGHTING TERROR IS NOT FIGHTING ISLAM </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) ASKED ABOUT THE HOLY SEE\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ISLAM </p><p>AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, TAURAN SAID IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE CLEAR </p><p>THAT FIGHTING AGAINST TERROR DOES NOT MEAN FIGHTING ISLAM. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT AMERICAN BISHOPS MADE THIS CLEAR AFTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA04398 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
