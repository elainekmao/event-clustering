<p>UNCLAS HANOI 002665 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP, INR/EAP/SEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VM, ASEAN </p><p>SUBJECT:  ENERGIZING ASEAN IN THE ARF </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 227617; B) STATE 222865 </p><p> </p><p>1.   THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE.  SEE PARA SIX. </p><p> </p><p>2.   POLOFF PRESENTED REF A POINTS TO MFA ASEAN DEPARTMENT </p><p>EXPERT PHAM MINH THU ON 8 DECEMBER.  THU WAS NOT PREPARED TO </p><p>RESPOND TO POLOFF\'S QUESTIONS IN MORE THAN GENERALITIES.  HE </p><p>SAID OVERALL ASEAN AGREES WITH ARF VIEWS ON ENHANCING THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02665  081040Z </p><p>POSITION OF THE ARF CHAIR, WITH THE AIM OF STRENGTHENING </p><p>ASEAN\'S ROLE IN THE ARF.  ANY ENHANCEMENTS, HOWEVER, MUST BE </p><p>UNDERTAKEN ACCORDING TO ALREADY-AGREED GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF </p><p>THE ARF. </p><p> </p><p>3.   ON MOVEMENT TOWARD PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY, THU REPEATED </p><p>THE WELL-WORN MANTRA THAT PROGRESS MUST MOVE AT A PACE </p><p>COMFORTABLE TO ALL.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER, THU NOTED, </p><p>THAT THE ARF IS, FIRST AND FOREMOST, A FORUM FOR DIALOGUE ON </p><p>POLITICAL AND SECURITY ISSUES, THE MAIN PURPOSE OF WHICH IS </p><p>TO BUILD MUTUAL CONFIDENCE.  THE MAJORITY OF ARF MEMBERS </p><p>AGREE THAT THE ARF NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD, BUT THE UNRESOLVED </p><p>ISSUE REMAINS HOW TO ACHIEVE PROGRESS WITHOUT UPSETTING </p><p>MUTUAL CONFIDENCE LEVELS, WHICH THU DESCRIBED AS STILL </p><p>INADEQUATE. </p><p> </p><p>4.   THU OFFERED THAT ALL ARF MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO </p><p>SUBMIT THEIR VIEWS ON THE ROLE OF THE ARF CHAIR, THE </p><p>REGISTRATION OF EXPERTS AND EMINENT PERSONS, AND STEPS </p><p>TOWARD PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY TO THE ARF CHAIR BY 15 JANUARY. </p><p>THU EXPECTED HIS DEPARTMENT TO HAVE MORE CONCRETE COMMENTS </p><p>TO OFFER IN LATE JANUARY.  EMBASSY WILL REVISIT REFTEL </p><p>ISSUES WITH THE MFA AT THAT TIME. </p><p> </p><p>5.   COMMENT:  THIS MEETING FOLLOWED A WELL-ESTABLISHED </p><p>PATTERN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE VIETNAMESE ON THE ARF. </p><p>DESPITE VIETNAM\'S OSTENSIBLE LEADERSHIP OF THE ARF THIS </p><p>YEAR, ANY CONSENSUS TO MOVE FORWARD MORE VIGOROUSLY ON ARF </p><p>OBJECTIVES WILL PROBABLY FIND VIETNAM AT THE TAIL END OF THE </p><p>QUEUE, BEING DRAGGED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02665  081040Z </p><p>6.  ACTION REQUEST:  PER REFTELS A AND B ON INVITING </p><p>VIETNAMESE AND OTHER OFFICIALS TO OBSERVE MULTILATERAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, EMBASSY WEIGHED IN WHEN DEPARTMENT FIRST </p><p>RAISED THE IDEA SOME MONTHS AGO.  OUR VIEW STILL IS THAT IT </p><p>COULD POTENTIALLY BE VERY BENEFICIAL, AS LONG AS IT IS </p><p>OFFERED IN A WAY WHICH DOES NOT MAKE VIETNAM FEEL SINGLED </p><p>OUT FOR REMEDIAL TREATMENT.  IN ORDER TO GET A FIRMER FIX ON </p><p>WHETHER THE IDEA IS PRACTICAL, EMBASSY WOULD LIKE TO FLOAT </p><p>THE IDEA IN MORE DETAIL WITH MFA COUNTERPARTS.  WE REQUEST </p><p>POINTS WHICH WE MAY USE WITH THE GVN. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
