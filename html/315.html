<p>UNCLAS KAMPALA 04953 </p><p> </p><p>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER </p><p>SUBJECT: UGANDA: 1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 363024 </p><p> </p><p>1. THE ABILITY OF THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT TO REACT IN A </p><p>TIMELY AND/OR EFFECTIVE MANNER IS LIMITED.  TO THE BEST </p><p>OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS NO SPECIFIC AGENCY THAT IS </p><p>SINGULARLY TASKED WITH HANDLING A TERRORISM INCIDENT. </p><p>THE MOST PROBABLE ACTION AGENCY WOULD BE THE INTERNAL </p><p>SECURITY ORGANIZATION ACTING ON APPROVAL OF THE OFFICE </p><p>OF THE PRESIDENT.  IT IS LIKELY THAT THE NATIONAL </p><p>POLICE AND ITS SPECIAL BRANCH COMPONENT, AS WELL AS THE </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE PERSONNEL UNDER THE POLICE INSPECTOR </p><p>GENERAL WOULD COOPERATE WITH THE DIRECT ACTION AGENCY </p><p>IN HANDLING THE INCIDENT/S.  THERE PROBABLY IS NO </p><p>MANAGEMENT CRISIS TEAM WITHIN THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>MANAGE EITHER A TERRORIST INCIDENT OR HOSTAGE TYPE </p><p>CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (PLO) HAS AN </p><p>OFFICE IN KAMPALA WHICH RECENTLY HAS BEEN GIVEN </p><p>DIPLOMATIC STATUS BY THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT.  THE PLO </p><p>MISSION IN KAMPALA ALSO RECENTLY WAS HEADED BY AN </p><p>AMBASSADOR WHO WAS NAMED/DESIGNATED BY PLO LEADER </p><p>ARAFAT.  UGANDA HAS OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED THE PLO AS A </p><p>SEPARATE STATE WITH ARAFAT ENSCONCED AS ITS PRESIDENT. </p><p>UGANDA HAS OFTEN EXPRESSED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE PLO AND </p><p>ITS STRUGGLE FOR A HOMELAND. </p><p> </p><p>3. THERE ARE TWO OTHER MISSIONS IN KAMPALA THAT COULD </p><p>BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN.  THESE INCLUDE THE LIBYAN </p><p>PEOPLE\'S BUREAU (LPB), THE HEAD OF WHOM HAS BEEN </p><p>ELEVATED TO AMBASSADOR STATUS, AS A RESULT OF </p><p>INCREASINGLY WARM RELATIONS BETWEEN UGANDA AND LIBYA. </p><p>DURING RECENT MONTHS, UNIDENTIFIED LIBYAN PERSONNEL </p><p>HAVE CARRIED OUT SURVEILLANCE AGAINST THE U.S. </p><p>MISSION\'S MARINE CONTINGENT BUT SUCH SURVEILLANCE WAS </p><p>DISCONTINUED.  ALSO, THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE\'S REPUBLIC </p><p>OF KOREA (DPRK) CONSISTS OF A SMALL DIPLOMATIC MISSION </p><p>WHOSE PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE IN THE PAST IN </p><p>REGARD TO SURVEILLANCE OF US MISSION PERSONNEL. </p><p>RECENTLY, THE SOVIETS HAVE SOUGHT INFORMATION TO </p><p>IDENTIFY SOME NEWLY ARRIVED US MISSION PERSONNEL, </p><p>HOWEVER, THEIR ACTIONS WERE PROBABLY RELATED TO </p><p>FURTHERANCE OF THEIR CI EFFORTS RATHER THAN BEARING ANY </p><p>RELATIONSHIP TO TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT HAS REPEATEDLY STATED THAT </p><p>THEY WILL NOT ALLOW ITS TERRITORY TO BE USED AS A BASE </p><p>FOR INSURGENT GROUPS WHICH ATTACK UGANDA\'S NEIGHBORS OR </p><p>FOR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  AT PRESENT THE U.S. MISSION DOES NOT HAVE ANY </p><p>INFORMATION OR EVIDENCE OF TERRORIST-RELATED ACTIVITIES </p><p>IN UGANDA.  THIS, HOWEVER, DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE FACT </p><p>THAT THE MERE PRESENCE OF LIBYANS GIVE RISE TO THE </p><p>POTENTIAL OF A TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE USG AND OUR </p><p>INTERESTS IN UGANDA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BURROUGHS </p><p></p></div>
