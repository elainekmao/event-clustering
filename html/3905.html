<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002803 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/EPS - WENDELL ALBRIGHT, PASS TO USTR </p><p>- C. HAMILTON, COMMERCE/ITA - G. GELDMAN, TREASURY - </p><p>E. BARBER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, PGOV, NI, AGOA </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: AGOA ELIGIBILITY REVIEW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 171150;    (B) 01 ABUJA 02856; </p><p>      (C) 00 STATE 110733; (D) 00 STATE 127971; </p><p>      (E) 00 STATE 126813 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. In response to Ref A, the following is an update of </p><p>the information provided previously in Nigeria\'s AGOA </p><p>eligibility (Ref B.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PROGRESS TOWARD A MARKET ECONOMY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.1A: The GON continues to make incremental </p><p>progress toward establishing a market-based economy </p><p>that protects private property rights, incorporates an </p><p>open rules-based trading system and generally reduces </p><p>government interference in the economy.  Despite the </p><p>failure of winning bidders to obtain the financing </p><p>necessary to pay the purchase price for the </p><p>telecommunications monopoly NITEL and the </p><p>disintegration of the joint partnership that won the </p><p>bid on the ship repair facility Nigerdock, the GON </p><p>remains committed to the privatization process. </p><p>Efforts to privatize two large, modern hotels in </p><p>Abuja, as well as newsprint, sugar and tractor </p><p>manufacturing companies are proceeding apace.  After </p><p>the GON successfully auctioned three GSM licenses in </p><p>2001, a second national telecommunications carrier was </p><p>designated in August 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In July, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) re- </p><p>introduced a modified Dutch Auction System (DAS) for </p><p>foreign exchange which tied officially traded Naira to </p><p>a market mechanism,  greatly reducing the discount </p><p>between the parallel market and officially traded </p><p>Naira.  Prior to the DAS, the spread between the two </p><p>rates had risen to 17-20 percent, thus  diverting a </p><p>significant amount of banking activities  from </p><p>investment  into non-productive arbitrage activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For the current fiscal year 2002, the Executive agreed </p><p>to the CBN request to cap  deficit spending at 12.5 </p><p>percent of the total expected revenue for the year. </p><p>This established a hard-line of debt, beyond which the </p><p>government cannot spend.  The result has been periodic </p><p>halts to all government payments for capital projects </p><p>and delays on recurrent expenditures until the CBN </p><p>receives revenues so as to remain within the 12.5 </p><p>percent deficit band. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Presidency established in 2001 an office to review </p><p>all capital projects of more than USD $10,000.  This </p><p>new "due diligence" requirement has reduced  some of </p><p>the  most blatant forms of corruption in new capital </p><p>projects, but it is time consuming , not  widely </p><p>understood by many  contractors or civil servants and </p><p>still can be circumvented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Government  policies helped lower year-to-year </p><p>inflation rates (from 19.5 to 16.5 percent) and </p><p>reduced growth of the money supply to within CBN </p><p>targets, both improvements over last year\'s </p><p>performance.  They also demonstrated commitment to a </p><p>significant degree of economic reform and fiscal </p><p>discipline by the Obasanjo Administration at </p><p>considerable political cost during the build up to the </p><p>2003 elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL PLURALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.1 B: The elected civilian government is now </p><p>in its fourth year.  The GON has repeated its </p><p>commitment to the rule of law, human rights and </p><p>democracy and has established a commission to </p><p>investigate abuses by security forces related to </p><p>ethnic violence between the Tivs and Jukun ethnic </p><p>groups in 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Despite the Executive-Legislature impasse over budget </p><p>and spending processes, and the threatened impeachment </p><p>proceedings against the President, all key political </p><p>figures and the vast majority of Nigerians </p><p>steadfastly support the democratic process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Three new political parties have been registered, and </p><p>a voter registration program was conducted in </p><p>September 2002, albeit with widespread complaints that </p><p>large numbers of Nigerians were unable to register due </p><p>to a lack of materials and other irregularities with </p><p>the process.  National, including Presidential and </p><p>state elections, are planned for 2003.  Local </p><p>elections will take place in late 2002 or early 2003. </p><p>A USG-supported police modernization project was </p><p>launched in July 2002 with ICITAP personnel on the </p><p>ground in several cities providing training and </p><p>technical assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Supreme Court made landmark decisions in early </p><p>2002 that affirmed its role as the final arbiter of </p><p>the national constitution in the ongoing process of </p><p>the development of Nigerian democratic federalism. </p><p>While the Supreme Court and Appellate Courts have </p><p>distinguished themselves, the overall the judicial </p><p>system lacks the resources and administrative </p><p>capability to function effectively.  This results in </p><p>long delays in resolving civil and criminal cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In several instances in the year, local Shari\'a courts </p><p>have imposed stoning sentences against women for </p><p>adultery, which is a crime under the new Shari\'a code </p><p>in many States in Nigeria.  Several of the cases have </p><p>been dismissed.  In the highly publicized case of </p><p>Safiya Husseini, the stoning sentence was overturned </p><p>by a State Appellate Court in March.  Another well- </p><p>publicized stoning case is in the appellate process. </p><p>The Federal Government has stated its opposition to </p><p>these sentences; under the Nigerian constitution, it </p><p>must allow these matters to be resolved by the </p><p>judicial system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ethnic and religious tension continued in 2002, though </p><p>at a lower level than 2001.  Communal clashes resulted </p><p>in dozens of deaths and injuries, and displaced </p><p>hundreds of people.  The GON has established and </p><p>supports commissions and other groups working to end </p><p>communal violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NONDISCRIMINATION IN TRADE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.1C: Nigeria generally does not discriminate </p><p>against U.S. goods or services and allows for the free </p><p>movement of foreign exchange into and out of the </p><p>country.  The GON continues to move toward policies </p><p>eliminating barriers to US trade and investment, </p><p>although tariffs were amended and revised upwards in </p><p>2002. The GON is moving toward lower tariffs on </p><p>manufacturing inputs and reduced the duty on wheat to </p><p>5%, but prohibitive tariffs were implemented in 2002 </p><p>on other imports, notably detergents, rice, poultry </p><p>and printed fabrics and other items were banned </p><p>outright.  The GON continues to work toward </p><p>restructuring the intellectual property rights regime, </p><p>with legislation pending to create a quasi-independent </p><p>IPR commission and to bring Nigeria into full </p><p>compliance with the WTO TRIPS agreement.  Nigeria is </p><p>party to numerous conventions and agreements regarding </p><p>patent, trademark and copyright protection, and the </p><p>country\' s laws generally favor protection of </p><p>intellectual property owners and provide criminal </p><p>penalties for violation of their rights.  Even though </p><p>significant progress has been made in strengthening </p><p>IPR laws and regulations, enforcement of IPR laws is </p><p>weak due to scarce resources and a lack of expertise </p><p>by the courts and enforcement officials.  Limited </p><p>progress has been made in regard to licensed materials </p><p>such as software and optical media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POVERTY REDUCTION </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.1D: Poverty alleviation progresses at a slow </p><p>pace.  GDP growth was at 3.9% for 2001, while the </p><p>country\'s population grew at 3.1%.  After a slow </p><p>start, the GON is now engaged with the World Bank and </p><p>donor community in preparing a Poverty Reduction </p><p>Strategy Paper with a view towards coordinating its </p><p>own anti-poverty efforts with those of the </p><p>international community.  Other parts of the GON </p><p>Poverty Alleviation program include an on-again, off- </p><p>again program of paying small stipends to a limited </p><p>number of the unemployed and Universal Basic </p><p>Education, which is building two schools in each of </p><p>Nigeria\'s 774 local government areas.  The Niger Delta </p><p>Development Commission (NDDC), a publicly funded </p><p>entity, was created to better promote development in </p><p>the eight states of the oil-producing region, one of </p><p>the poorest in the country.  As of September 2002, the </p><p>NDDC had received N32 billion ($254 million US) over </p><p>the 20 months ending September 2002. </p><p>CORRUPTION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Item 4.1.1E: Corruption remains a perceived and real </p><p>problem throughout Nigerian institutions, and the GON </p><p>maintains efforts to combat corruption, with uneven </p><p>results.  An anti-corruption commission is in place, </p><p>and the GON continues to audit public enterprises. </p><p>Since 2001, all federally funded capital projects over </p><p>USD $ 10,000 must pass a due diligence test before </p><p>funding and implementation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ITEM 4.1.F.2: The GON does not engage in activities </p><p>that undermine US national security or foreign policy </p><p>interests.  Nigeria has been one of our staunchest </p><p>anti-terrorism allies in Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHILD LABOR </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ITEM 5: In 2002 President Obasanjo signed the </p><p>instruments of ratification for ILO Convention 182, </p><p>Worst form of Child Labor, Convention138, Minimum Age </p><p>for Employment, and Convention 111, Equality of </p><p>Occupation.  Existing legislation prohibits children </p><p>under 15 years to work in most sectors and outlaws </p><p>forced or compulsory labor, but enforcement remains </p><p>weak. Draft legislation was under review in the </p><p>National Assembly that would make trafficking in </p><p>persons (including children) a crime; however, no </p><p>action was taken on it by year\'s end. There were few </p><p>statistics available to determine the success of </p><p>ongoing antitrafficking campaigns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
