THE PRESENT </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT AGREEMENT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO ENCOMPASS WORK </p><p>ON SUCH MATTERS, BUT THE IDLI BOARD OF DIRECTORS FELT </p><p>THAT IDLI SHOULD HAVE A MORE SPECIFIC MANDATE IN ORDER TO </p><p>PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN ITS FIELD. THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO </p><p>ARTICLE II (PURPOSES AND ACTIVITIES) MAKE THIS MANDATE </p><p>CLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>3.
