<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001077 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EB ACTION OFFICER AND WHA/CA </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND MATHIEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ETTC, PREL, CA, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01:  MORE ON CANADA\'S FREEZE OF IRAQI </p><p>GOVERNMENT ASSETS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. OTTAWA 890 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 74249 </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (SBU) Ref A reported that the GOC froze Iraqi government </p><p>assets in compliance with the 1990 UNSC resolutions.  The </p><p>Department of Finance clarified April 14 that the amount </p><p>remaining is "insignificant" (estimated at under C$20,000). </p><p>Most of the US$2.73 million notified to the UN in 1991 have </p><p>been used for the Iraqi embassy\'s operational expenses or </p><p>authorized for humanitarian use in Iraq before implementation </p><p>of the Oil for Food program. </p><p>2.  (SBU) Canadian banks are prohibited from transactions </p><p>with Iraq, so the GOC does not expect an increase in the </p><p>amount of Iraqi assets in Canada.  Canadian financial </p><p>institutions do not have a list of Iraqi individuals to </p><p>consult in deciding on asset freezes, and Iraqi funds that </p><p>come from a third country would not be captured in the data. </p><p>There is no reporting requirement for Iraqi assets, and the </p><p>GOC does not maintain an accounting of the total. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)   As the assets were frozen in compliance with a UN </p><p>directive, they could be unfrozen by a similar UN order for </p><p>the benefit of a new Iraqi government.  We do not believe the </p><p>GOC will release the frozen assets absent international </p><p>consensus.  Although they would be most comfortable with UN </p><p>authorization, a lawyer with the Department of Foreign </p><p>Affairs and Trade recalled that release of Yugoslav assets </p><p>had been the result of action in the G-7. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
