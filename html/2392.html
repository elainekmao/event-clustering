<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000122 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, EPET, EFIN, ECON, NI, SCOI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: STRIKE HAS LIMITED IMPACT DURING FIRST </p><p>DAY IN NORTHERN NIGERIA; DETENTION OF NLC PRESIDENT </p><p>OHSIOMHOLE MAY GALVANIZE STRIKERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) LAGOS 105 </p><p>     B. B) LAGOS 106 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: As of 1:30 pm Nigeria Time (7:30 am EST), the </p><p>Nigerian Labour Congress, general strike was most effective </p><p>in Lagos (Lagos septel).  Although showing slightly less than </p><p>normal activity, Abuja has not been greatly affected by the </p><p>strike.  However, there was substantial compliance in the </p><p>Northern industrial city of Kaduna and partial observance in </p><p>the key city of Kano.  In Jos, it was business as usual, </p><p>except for significant absenteeism among civil servants. </p><p>Reports by government officials, media and local contacts in </p><p>other northern Nigerian cities indicate little violence thus </p><p>far as a result of the strike.  However, the apparent </p><p>detention of NLC President Adams Oshiomhole, if it holds, has </p><p>the potential to raise tempers and will likely be used by </p><p>strike organizers as a rallying point in their attempts to </p><p>galvanize support.   End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>NLC President Detained </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) According to a member of the Embassy surveillance </p><p>detection unit who witnessed the event, NLC President </p><p>Oshiomhole and two others were detained in front of the </p><p>Federal Secretariat Complex in Abuja around 11:00 local time. </p><p> Apparently, Oshiomhole arrived at the Secretariat in a </p><p>convoy of approximately ten (10) vehicles that blocked the </p><p>complex,s entrance.  As he started to give a speech to a </p><p>group of federal workers, police arrived and fired tear gas, </p><p>dispersing the small crowd.  Plainclothes security officers </p><p>then took Oshiomhole, who resisted, and placed him in an </p><p>unmarked Peugeot vehicle.  The vehicle departed the area </p><p>through the entrance to the Supreme Court, heading in the </p><p>general direction of Aso Villa.  There were no reported </p><p>injuries at the Federal Secretariat, and activity around the </p><p>area soon returned to normal.  Media reports have as many as </p><p>20 other senior labor leaders being arrested, including the </p><p>Dr. Oyediran, President of the Nigeria,s Academic Staff </p><p>Union of Universities (ASUU).  We are unable to confirm these </p><p>reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Union officials in Kaduna believe that Oshiomhole </p><p>will be charged with a crime and held in an attempt to break </p><p>the strike.  Sources at the Presidency say that no official </p><p>comment will come until the conclusion of the weekly Federal </p><p>Executive Council meeting.  Comment: Oshiomhole may have been </p><p>courting arrest in an effort to galvanize support.  The GON </p><p>had issued stern warnings to civil servants that absence </p><p>would not be tolerated, so Oshimhole must have known that </p><p>blocking the main gate to the Federal Secretariat complex </p><p>would prompt a forceful GON reaction. End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THE STRIKE: A POPULAR ACTION? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Meeting with PolCouns in Kaduna yesterday, a senior </p><p>official of the National Union of Textile Workers correctly </p><p>predicted the strike in Kaduna would be effective.  He stated </p><p>that labor was well organized in the city and that the fuel </p><p>price hikes had precipitated a substantial increase in </p><p>consumer prices, particularly for foodstuffs and </p><p>transportation, that negatively affected everyone.  As an </p><p>example, he emphasized that cab fares in Kaduna had nearly </p><p>doubled since the announced increased.  More resigned than </p><p>eager to strike, he asserted the NLC would call off the </p><p>strike if the GON signaled its willingness to negotiate and </p><p>compromise on the extent and timing of the price hike.  He </p><p>claimed that the NLC could live with an increase implemented </p><p>in stages. The fuel hike, coupled with the GON,s delay in </p><p>implementing the pledged 25 percent minimum wage increase </p><p>last year, had placed the NLC leadership in a difficult </p><p>position.  If the NLC did not take action, the rank and file </p><p>would accuse the leadership of kowtowing to government, he </p><p>maintained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Labor,s participation in the Petroleum Pricing and </p><p>Regulatory Committee (though they now disassociate themselves </p><p>from its decisions) and their refusal to adhere to the </p><p>statutory 21 day cooling-off period have cost them some </p><p>support.  Also important in winning support for the </p><p>government position is participation by popular Kaduna </p><p>Governor Muhammad Makarfi and other governors in opposing the </p><p>strike as "illegal" and a threat to "the survival of </p><p>democracy, peaceful co-existence and the rule of law." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Since the increased official rates went into effect, </p><p>Northern consumers have seen black market prices go down to </p><p>40 to 50 Naira per liter from the 80 to 90 liter prices </p><p>before the hike.  In many areas of the North, there are </p><p>virtually no transactions at the official rates.  The </p><p>increase of the official price, increased production from </p><p>domestic refineries and recently allowed gasoline imports </p><p>have created considerable downward pressure in the real cost </p><p>of gasoline for Northern Nigerian motorists.  The real </p><p>popular issue is not the 18 percent increase in the cost of </p><p>fuel, but the sudden and much sharper opportunistic increase </p><p>(50 to 100 percent) in food and transportation costs noted </p><p>above. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>City by City Reports </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) In Kaduna, most stores, gas stations, banks and </p><p>markets were closed although a few stores and markets showed </p><p>signs of limited activity by the afternoon.  While contacts </p><p>agree there is widespread observance of the strike in Kaduna, </p><p>compliance in other key northern cities is not quite as high. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Kano: The North,s largest city, Kano is a busy </p><p>commercial center and labor unions are active but not as </p><p>strong as in Kaduna.  Incoming traffic was delayed this </p><p>morning by the presence of bonfires on a few roads leading </p><p>into the city.  However, by mid-day, most markets and stores </p><p>were open for business.  Most gas stations remained closed </p><p>and noticeably fewer commercial vehicles were seen plying the </p><p>roads.  Overall, the city appeared calm, according to our </p><p>contacts.  Note: Most gas stations in Kano are closed most of </p><p>the time on normal days; the vast majority of fuel sales take </p><p>place on the black market. End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Zaria: In the home of Ahmadu Bello University, which </p><p>has a history of student activism, some students apparently </p><p>joined the strikers by starting bonfires and engaging in </p><p>petty harassment of motorists, but there were no major </p><p>disruptions.  Gas stations were closed and streets less busy </p><p>than usual. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Jos: Although many government workers failed to </p><p>report to work, most banks, stores and market were open. The </p><p>city appeared calm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Maiduguri: This is another fairly active commercial </p><p>center.  Strike observance was substantial, according to </p><p>local contacts, but no disturbances were reported.  Most </p><p>government offices and shops were closed.  Vehicular traffic </p><p>was much less than normal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Sokoto: This city, the administrative center for the </p><p>northwest corner of the country and the seat of the </p><p>traditional Sultanate, experienced limited observance of the </p><p>strike with most markets, stores and facilities open. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) American Citizens: Embassy thus far has no reports of </p><p>any significant negative effects on American citizens </p><p>residing in Northern and Middle Belt States.  We assume minor </p><p>inconveniences affect them as much as they affect Nigerians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Mission travelers: Two Mission AmCits (one USDH and </p><p>one USPSC) have been asked to remain in Kano for another </p><p>night in order not to have to pass through Kaduna at this </p><p>time.  International flights are reportedly operating </p><p>normally.  As a precautionary measure, Embassy will use a </p><p>two-vehicle convoy to support in-bound and out-bound visitors </p><p>tonight. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
