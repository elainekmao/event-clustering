(SBU) Summary and Comment:  On June 24, Amman-based </p><p>regional refcoord and PRM DART-Iraq team members visited </p><p>UNHCR refugee camps on the Jordanian-Iraqi border and in </p><p>Ruweished, Jordan.  Combined population for the two camps </p><p>remains near 2,200:  1,200 Iranian Kurds from Al Tash </p><p>refugee camp and other undocumented nationals in no-man\'s </p><p>land (NML) between the Iraqi and Jordanian border posts, as </p><p>well as 899 Palestinians and 163 Somalis and Sudanese in </p><p>UNHCR\'s refugee camp at Ruweished.  The Somalis and </p><p>Sudanese, previously held in the Jordan Red Crescent\'s TCN </p><p>transit camp, were moved to the UNHCR camp on June 23 as </p><p>part of the GOJ\'s decision to close the TCN transit camp. </p><p>The NML population has begun to decrease, with 44 Iranian </p><p>Kurds having left for northern Iraq and another 75 </p><p>considering a move in the near future.  The MEK population </p><p>in NML has dwindled from its original 96 members to just </p><p>five.  Although concerned by the poor living and security </p><p>conditions in NML, both the GOJ and UNHCR have indicated </p><p>they are willing to support the NML camp until a solution </p><p>can be found for the Iranian Kurds from Al Tash refugee </p><p>camp.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>NML Population:  Al Tash Kurds ... </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) UNHCR reports that the refugee population in no- </p><p>man\'s land (NML) between the Iraqi and Jordanian border </p><p>posts of Trebil and Karameh has remained stable at roughly </p><p>1,200 since mid-May.  1,100 of the refugees are Iranian </p><p>Kurds from UNHCR\'s Al Tash refugee camp near Ramadi, Iraq. </p><p>The Al Tash Kurds began arriving at the border on April 14, </p><p>citing a lack of UNHCR services, general insecurity and fear </p><p>of political reprisals from neighboring Arab tribes as their </p><p>reasons for fleeing Al Tash refugee camp (ref).  The Kurds </p><p>have held daily protests since mid-May, demanding entry to </p><p>Jordan and resettlement in third countries - but attracting </p><p>no notice from the hundreds of journalists that pass through </p><p>the Jordanian-Iraqi border en route to Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Since May 29, when the GOJ told the Kurds they would </p><p>not be allowed to enter Jordan, more than 40 Iranian Kurds </p><p>have left NML for the northern Iraqi village of Kallar, just </p><p>outside Suleimaniyah, where some of the Kurds have </p><p>relatives.  Another 75 are considering leaving NML for </p><p>Kallar but are unwilling to do so without guarantees from </p><p>UNHCR and the coalition forces regarding safety, security, </p><p>humanitarian assistance and resettlement possibilities in a </p><p>third country - possibly the United States.  The 75 Kurds </p><p>told UNHCR they could convince another 600 to leave NML for </p><p>northern Iraq if UNHCR could provide written guarantees for </p><p>resettlement.  The Kurds told PRM officers that they view a </p><p>move to northern Iraq as temporary, a transit point as they </p><p>seek asylum in a third country.  The NML Kurds also reported </p><p>"several hundred" Kurds have left Al Tash refugee camp for </p><p>Kallar, wooed by promises made by visiting PUK officials </p><p>that they would have a better life in northern Iraq. </p><p>UNHCR/Iraq has been unable to confirm how many Kurds have </p><p>left Al Tash camp for northern Iraq.  UNHCR/Iraq also has </p><p>advised UNHCR/Jordan that it would be unable to support an </p><p>assisted movement of NML Kurds to northern Iraq before </p><p>November, as it has neither sufficient staff nor services in </p><p>place to accommodate a new refugee population.  Frustrated </p><p>by UNHCR\'s slow response, some of the 75 Kurds are </p><p>considering moving to Kallar without UNHCR assistance. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The core group of 1,000 Iranian Kurds in NML refuses </p><p>to return to Iraq, claiming it is a "jail" in which they </p><p>suffered for 23 years, restricted to Al Anbar governorate </p><p>and deprived of social and economic opportunities.  The </p><p>Kurds told PRM officers that they doubt that the change in </p><p>Iraq\'s leadership will bring changes in their situation, </p><p>claiming they suffer from poor UNHCR management as well as </p><p>discrimination from local Arab tribes.  (Some of the Kurds </p><p>claim, for example, that their applications for resettlement </p><p>or voluntary repatriation to Iran languished for three or </p><p>four years without a response from UNHCR.)  Some of the </p><p>Kurds also claim they cannot return to their native Iran, as </p><p>they are political opponents of the clerical regime and </p><p>would face certain death or imprisonment if they returned </p><p>home.  (Several hundred Iranian Kurds from Al Tash camp had </p><p>in fact been rejected for voluntary repatriation by the </p><p>Iranian government.)  The Al Tash Kurds in NML therefore see </p><p>resettlement in a third country as their only option. </p><p>Although the GOJ has indicated it would be willing to allow </p><p>the Kurds to transit Jordan if they had onward documentation </p><p>and tickets for resettlement in a third country, UNHCR </p><p>(correctly, in our opinion) refuses to conduct resettlement </p><p>screening from NML, fearing it would create a pull factor </p><p>for disgruntled refugees and Iraqi nationals from throughout </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>... and a Hodgepodge of Undocumented Others </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) NML also is home to another 100 or so people with </p><p>document problems, a hodgepodge of nationalities and </p><p>political problems.  The original group of NML residents - </p><p>96 Mujahadeen-e-Khalq (MEK) members -- has dwindled to just </p><p>five, three of whom have onward travel documentation for the </p><p>UK and are waiting to sort out the details.  Six self- </p><p>described Iranian Persians (former POWs and Iranian </p><p>oppositionists) also fled Al Tash refugee camp and are </p><p>seeking resettlement in a third country.  Two undocumented </p><p>Jordanian Palestinians, who seem to have fled Jordan after </p><p>Black September, also remain at the border hoping for </p><p>resettlement.  A group of 41 undocumented Palestinians who </p><p>arrived after the GOJ reverted to pre-war border practices </p><p>for Palestinians on May 22 (see para 7 for details) also </p><p>remains in NML, hoping to enter - and presumably resettle in </p><p>- Jordan.  As with the Iranian Kurds, UNHCR has told this </p><p>group it cannot be processed for a durable solution - </p><p>including resettlement in a third country - as long as it </p><p>remains in NML.  Like the Kurds, this group refuses to </p><p>return to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Palestinians and TCNs in UNHCR\'s Ruweished Refugee Camp </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) UNHCR\'s refugee camp at Ruweished, Jordan is now </p><p>home to 899 Palestinians from Baghdad and 163 Somalis and </p><p>Sudanese, moved from the Jordan Red Crescent\'s TCN transit </p><p>camp on June 23 after the GOJ decided to close the camp. </p><p>This group of Somalis and Sudanese are long-term residents </p><p>of Iraq who refuse to return to their country of origin but </p><p>also are unwilling to return to Iraq.  UNHCR has interviewed </p><p>this group and found that only four qualify for UNHCR </p><p>refugee status. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The GOJ agreed to admit the Palestinians to the </p><p>UNHCR refugee camp on April 21, seemingly in the hopes that </p><p>its gesture would encourage UNHCR to move the Al Tash Kurds </p><p>to a new refugee camp just inside the Iraqi border.  Once </p><p>the GOJ opened the border to Palestinians, a small but </p><p>steady steam began, resulting in more than 1,100 </p><p>Palestinians in the UNHCR refugee camp by mid-May.  On May </p><p>22, the GOJ reverted to its pre-war immigration policy for </p><p>Palestinians, allowing only those with proper documentation </p><p>and prior permission from the General Intelligence </p><p>Directorate to enter Jordan.  (This policy remained in place </p><p>for all other Jordanian borders - including the Allenby </p><p>bridge - throughout the war.)  This decision, coupled with </p><p>terrible sandstorms in late May, has led to a gradual exodus </p><p>from the camp.  As conditions worsen in the camp over the </p><p>summer, UNHCR expects that still more Palestinians will give </p><p>up and return to Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Nearly one-third of the Palestinians in the </p><p>Ruweished refugee camp are "mixed marriages," Palestinian- </p><p>Jordanian women (carrying Jordanian passports) married to </p><p>Palestinian-Iraqi men (with either Iraqi or no </p><p>documentation).  UNHCR believes that the GOJ will eventually </p><p>allow this group - roughly 300 individuals - to enter </p><p>Jordan.  According to the camp committee, the remainder of </p><p>the group seeks resettlement in a third country, preferably </p><p>in northern Europe where some of the Palestinians have </p><p>relatives.  The Palestinians represent a mix of 1948 </p><p>refugees (all of whom were originally from Haifa, and fled </p><p>Palestine with the retreating Iraqi army), 1967 refugees and </p><p>other Palestinians who were thrown out of the Gulf in the </p><p>aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.  (Although the camp </p><p>committee members did not mention this to PRM officers, the </p><p>Palestinian community in Iraq also includes various </p><p>rejectionist factions.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The Palestinians told PRM officers that Iraq is </p><p>"finished" for them.   As a minority within Iraq\'s Sunni </p><p>minority, they fear they will be the first to suffer </p><p>political reprisals from the Shi\'a majority.  The </p><p>Palestinians also said Iraqis view the Palestinians as, at </p><p>best, having been a privileged group under Saddam\'s regime </p><p>and, at worst, supporters of the Saddam regime.  This is the </p><p>reason, they said, that Palestinians have been kicked out of </p><p>their homes in Baghdad.  (NOTE:  Other Palestinians have </p><p>reported that economics, rather than politics, led to a rise </p><p>in their bargain-basement rents, previously enforced by </p><p>Saddam\'s regime.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) The Palestinians also rejected a theoretical </p><p>return to an independent state of Palestine, emphatically </p><p>telling PRM officers that they are from Haifa, inside Green- </p><p>Line Israel and would not be welcome there.  A return to the </p><p>West Bank or Gaza, they said, would not be a return to their </p><p>country of origin.  Moreover, the GOJ\'s reluctance to accept </p><p>more Palestinian refugees rules out local integration as an </p><p>option.  For these Palestinians, resettlement is perceived </p><p>as their only option.  (NOTE:  Palestinian refugees outside </p><p>UNRWA\'s areas of operations - e.g., Iraq - fall under </p><p>UNHCR\'s mandate and therefore could be considered for </p><p>resettlement as a durable solution.  However, the fact that </p><p>these Palestinian refugees are now under UNHCR protection in </p><p>an area of UNRWA operation - Jordan - poses difficult legal </p><p>questions for the two agencies.  Moreover, as UNHCR Jordan </p><p>Representative Sten Bronee noted to PRM officers, UNHCR\'s </p><p>predominantly Arab-origin expatriate staff in the Middle </p><p>East express great resistance to the idea of resettling any </p><p>Palestinian refugees, due to the implications of such </p><p>resettlement for the larger Palestinian refugee question.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Camp Management and Cost Issues </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) UNHCR and its implementing partners - the Hashemite </p><p>Charitable Organization, CARE, OXFAM and Japan Platform - </p><p>continue to provide services in the Ruweished and NML camps. </p><p>MSF, which had been providing additional medical assistance </p><p>and some psycho-social counseling, ended its program on June </p><p>30.  WFP is ending its food assistance on June 30, citing </p><p>its usual policy of providing assistance only to refugee </p><p>populations of more than 5,000 people.  ICRC and UNHCR will </p><p>continue to provide food assistance.  Medical and dental </p><p>care is emerging as a key issue for the NML camp, as UNHCR </p><p>is required to obtain special GOJ authorization to bring NML </p><p>residents into Jordan for specialized treatments.  (The </p><p>nearest hospital is in Ruweished, Jordan - 75 km from the </p><p>NML camp.)  Several NML refugees complained to PRM officers </p><p>that they had not received adequate medical treatment due to </p><p>the difficulties in traveling outside NML.  Refugee morale </p><p>seems to have improved in recent weeks, due largely to the </p><p>efforts of a UNHCR community services officer, seconded by </p><p>Save the Children. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) UNHCR and IOM currently are in negotiations over how </p><p>to handle the costs of caring for the 163 TCNs moved to the </p><p>UNHCR refugee camp on June 23.  UNHCR has recognized only </p><p>four of these TCNs as refugees but has agreed to provide </p><p>basic services on humanitarian grounds.  Water is likely to </p><p>emerge as a key cost-sharing issue for UNHCR and IOM.  After </p><p>three months of supplying water for the then-three refugee </p><p>camps from the municipality of Ruweished, the GOJ has </p><p>determined that it no longer can do so.  The GOJ turned on </p><p>the partially USAID-funded reverse osmosis (RO) water </p><p>treatment unit on June 23, enabling UNHCR to supply water </p><p>for the two camps from the GOJ-dug well near the Ruweished </p><p>refugee camp.  UNCHR officials note that the GOJ turned on </p><p>the RO unit just a few days after the USAID-financed </p><p>maintenance contract expired on June 11.  UNHCR is now in </p><p>negotiations with the GOJ over the cost of maintaining this </p><p>unit.  UNHCR estimates that it will require USD 2 million to </p><p>run the two camps for another six months. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) The GOJ\'s initial decision not to admit the </p><p>Iranian Kurds to Jordan has remained firm and we anticipate </p><p>that it will not change.  Although UNHCR initially </p><p>considered creating a new camp for the Kurds just inside the </p><p>Iraqi border, it has now ruled out the possibility, arguing </p><p>that a new camp would create a pull factor for disgruntled </p><p>nationals and refugees from throughout Iraq and create false </p><p>expectations for resettlement in a third country.  UNHCR </p><p>also believes a new cross-border camp would allow the GOJ to </p><p>formally close the door to asylum seekers.  We agree with </p><p>UNHCR\'s assessment.  Both the GOJ and UNHCR have indicated </p><p>they are willing to support the NML camp until a solution </p><p>can be found for the Iranian Kurds from Al Tash refugee </p><p>camp.  In the meantime, we are working with UNHCR to </p><p>identify solutions, including a return to Iraq and possibly </p><p>resettlement for some Iranian Kurds in the United States. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) The Palestinians\' situation is both more </p><p>complicated and potentially more manageable.  The division </p><p>of responsibility between UNHCR and UNRWA is a legal and </p><p>political morass, from which a durable solution for this </p><p>group of Palestinians is unlikely to emerge.  Yet given the </p><p>Palestinians\' strong ties to Jordan, UNHCR believes (and we </p><p>agree) that the GOJ eventually will admit some - if not all </p><p>- of the Palestinians to Jordan.  However, it is unlikely </p><p>that the GOJ will take any action regarding the Palestinians </p><p>until the situation at NML has been resolved. </p><p> </p><p>14.
