Inter-agency security standards prohibit the introduction </p><p>or use of non-USG owned computer hardware and software at all </p><p>USG diplomatic facilities.  Cell phones, palm pilots, radios </p><p>and other convenience electronics are prohibited in all </p><p>secure areas of the Mission. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Travelers who anticipate having special needs in terms of </p><p>either access or computer usage should contact the RSO office </p><p>before arriving at post. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY ADVISORY: </p><p> </p><p>5.  Post provides the following threat assessment for The </p><p>Netherlands: The Department of State on July 29, 2003 issued </p><p>a worldwide caution to alert Americans of the need to remain </p><p>vigilant.  The Department of State reminds U.S. citizens of </p><p>the continuing threat of terrorist actions that may target </p><p>U.S. citizens and and to update these potential threats.  The </p><p>U.S. Government remains deeply concerned about the security </p><p>of U.S. citizens overseas.  U.S. citizens are cautioned to </p><p>maintain a high level of vigilance, to remain alert and to </p><p>take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness. </p><p> </p><p>Tensions remaining from the recent events in Iraq may </p><p>increase the potential threat to U.S. citizens and interests </p><p>abroad, by terrorist and other groups.  Terrorist actions may </p><p>include, but are not limited to, suicide operations, </p><p>hijackings, bombings or kidnappings.  These may also involve </p><p>commercial aircraft.  other potential threats include </p><p>conventional weapons such as explosive devices or </p><p>non-conventional weapons, such as chemical or biological </p><p>agents.  Terrorists do not distinguish between official and </p><p>civilian targets.  These may include facilities where </p><p>American citizens and other foreigners congregate or visit, </p><p>including residential areas, clubs, restaurants, places of </p><p>worship, schools, hotels, outdoor recreation events or </p><p>resorts and beaches.  U.S. citizens should remain in a </p><p>heightened state of personal security awareness when </p><p>attendance at such locations is unavoidable.  Please consult </p><p>the Department\'s web site for text: http://travel.state.gov. </p><p>In light of this caution all visitors to The Netherlands are </p><p>encouraged to assess their security posture and be alert to </p><p>their surroundings for possible surveillance.  All visitors </p><p>should exercise caution while traveling abroad, as U.S. </p><p>citizens and facilities are often the target of groups </p><p>demonstrating opposition to U.S. foreign policy. </p><p> </p><p>6.  A concern for visitors is crime.  Most crimes against </p><p>official Americans are limited to pick-pocketing and luggage </p><p>theft.  Vandalism to automobiles, and theft from hotel rooms </p><p>are not unknown.  Recently, theft of laptop computers has </p><p>increased, especially at Schiphol airport and major train </p><p>stations.  The thieves operate in small groups, are </p><p>determined and well practiced at distraction theft.  Several </p><p>official travelers have been victimized lately, losing </p><p>personal and unclassified government computers, valuable </p><p>software and data.  Regulations require the use of the </p><p>diplomatic pouch for shipment of classified equipment and </p><p>information. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Streets can be walked in relative safety, but as in any </p><p>U.S. urban city, the same amount of caution should be </p><p>exercised after dark in the more populated cities of The </p><p>Hague, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam. Red-light districts and </p><p>public transportation hubs are common locations for incidents </p><p>of street crime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
