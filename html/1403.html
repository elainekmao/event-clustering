<p>UNCLAS STATE 229648 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR REFCOORD </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        STATE   229648  041725Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, CVIS, KSEP, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: REFUGEE PROCESSING:  EMBASSY REFERRALS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 215078 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN CLEARED BY M/P (SEP). </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY. THIS CABLE REMINDS POSTS THAT THEY ARE </p><p>AUTHORIZED TO IDENTIFY AND REFER APPLICANTS FOR POSSIBLE </p><p>REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IN THE U.S. IT ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE </p><p>ON WHICH REFUGEES MIGHT BE CONSIDERED FOR REFERRAL TO THE </p><p>ADMISSIONS PROGRAM. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  INDIVIDUALS OF ANY REPEAT ANY NATIONALITY MAY BE </p><p>PROCESSED AS PRIORITY ONE EMBASSY REFERRALS, WITH FEW </p><p>EXCEPTIONS, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO WASHINGTON. THOSE FEW </p><p>EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE PALESTINIANS, NORTH KOREANS, AND </p><p>LIBYANS, FOR WHOM THE BUREAU OF POPULATION, REFUGEES, AND </p><p>MIGRATION (PRM) AND THE OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT </p><p>INS HQ WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO AUTHORIZE PROCESSING IN </p><p>ADVANCE. IN ADDITION, POSTS WITH IN-COUNTRY PROGRAMS </p><p>(FORMER SOVIET UNION, VIETNAM, CUBA) MUST SEEK PRM </p><p>GUIDANCE BEFORE REFERRING NATIONALS OF THE HOST COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PRIORITY ONE IS DEFINED AS: </p><p> </p><p>A)  UNHCR-REFERRED OR EMBASSY-IDENTIFIED REFUGEES WHO ARE </p><p>FACING COMPELLING SECURITY CONCERNS IN COUNTRIES OF FIRST </p><p>ASYLUM, IN NEED OF LEGAL PROTECTION BECAUSE OF DANGERS OF </p><p>REFOULEMENT, OR WHO ARE IN DANGER DUE TO THREATS OF ARMED </p><p>ATTACK IN AREAS WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED, AND FORMER </p><p>POLITICAL PRISONERS. </p><p> </p><p>B)  UNHCR-REFERRED OR EMBASSY-IDENTIFIED REFUGEES, </p><p>INCLUDING REFUGEE WOMEN-AT-RISK, VICTIMS OF TORTURE OR </p><p>VIOLENCE, PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY DISABLED AND PERSONS IN </p><p>URGENT NEED OF MEDICAL TREATMENT NOT AVAILABLE IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY OF FIRST ASYLUM. </p><p> </p><p>C)  UNHCR-REFERRED OR EMBASSY-IDENTIFIED REFUGEES, FOR </p><p>WHOM OTHER DURABLE SOLUTIONS ARE NOT FEASIBLE AND WHOSE </p><p>STATUS IN THE PLACE OF ASYLUM DOES NOT PRESENT A </p><p>SATISFACTORY LONG-TERM SOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  A REFUGEE IS DEFINED UNDER U.S. LAW, INA SEC </p><p>101(A)(42), AS A PERSON WHO IS OUTSIDE HIS/HER COUNTRY OF </p><p>ORIGIN AND IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO RETURN DUE TO </p><p>PERSECUTION OR A WELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION ON </p><p>ACCOUNT OF RACE, RELIGION, NATIONALITY, MEMBERSHIP IN A </p><p>PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP OR POLITICAL OPINION.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN FORCED TO ABORT A </p><p>PREGNANCY OR TO UNDERGO INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATION, OR WHO </p><p>HAS BEEN PERSECUTED FOR FAILURE OR REFUSAL TO UNDERGO SUCH </p><p>A PROCEDURE OR FOR OTHER RESISTANCE TO A COERCIVE </p><p>POPULATION CONTROL PROGRAM SHALL BE DEEMED TO MEET THIS </p><p>DEFINITION.  PERSONS WHO ORDERED, INCITED, ASSISTED OR </p><p>OTHERWISE PARTICIPATED IN THE PERSECUTION OF ANY OTHER </p><p>PERSONS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SAME FIVE GROUNDS ARE EXCLUDED </p><p>FROM THE DEFINITION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WHILE INS HAS THE STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITY TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A </p><p>REFUGEE, EMBASSY-REFERRED CASES SHOULD BE CAREFULLY </p><p>SCREENED TO ENSURE THAT THE PERSON HAS A PRIMA FACIE </p><p>REFUGEE CLAIM. A P-1 REFERRAL PROVIDES A POTENTIAL REFUGEE </p><p>APPLICANT ACCESS TO U.S. RESETTLEMENT CONSIDERATION BUT </p><p>DOES NOT GUARANTEE HIS OR HER ACCEPTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE DEPARTMENT WISHES TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE </p><p>ACCESS TO THE U.S. REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM WORLDWIDE </p><p>FOR DESERVING REFUGEES IN NEED OF THIRD COUNTRY </p><p>RESETTLEMENT REGARDLESS OF NATIONALITY OR FAMILY TIES TO </p><p>THE UNITED STATES. WHILE WE DO NOT WANT TO OVERBURDEN </p><p>EMBASSIES, WE HOPE EMBASSY STAFF INDIVIDUALLY RECOMMEND </p><p>THOSE REFUGEES WHO ARE KNOWN TO THEM AND MAY BE AT RISK IN </p><p>THE COUNTRY OF FIRST ASYLUM OR OF BEING RETURNED TO A </p><p>COUNTRY WHERE THEY WOULD FACE PERSECUTION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN MOST INSTANCES, PRIORITY ONE CASES WILL COME TO THE </p><p>ATTENTION OF THE U.S. PROGRAM THROUGH REFERRALS FROM </p><p>UNHCR. PRM HAS BEEN WORKING WITH UNHCR GENEVA AND MANY OF </p><p>ITS FIELD OFFICES TO IMPROVE THE TRAINING UNHCR STAFF </p><p>RECEIVE IN THE AREA OF IDENTIFYING CASES IN NEED OF THIRD </p><p>COUNTRY RESETTLEMENT. POSTS SHOULD REFER TO CURRENT </p><p>REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROCESSING GUIDELINES (STATE 215078) </p><p>FOR GUIDANCE IN HANDLING UNHCR REFERRALS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  EMBASSIES, AS WELL AS UNHCR, ARE ALSO AUTHORIZED UNDER </p><p>PRIORITY ONE TO REFER CASES FOR REFUGEE ADMISSIONS </p><p>PROCESSING. SOME QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED REGARDING WHAT </p><p>EXACTLY IS INTENDED BY "EMBASSY-REFERRED" CASES. THE </p><p>FOLLOWING IS INTENDED AS GUIDANCE TO POSTS ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  CASES MOST LIKELY TO BE REFERRED FOR PROCESSING BY AN </p><p>EMBASSY WOULD INVOLVE FORMER FSNS OR HIGH PROFILE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE KNOWN TO THE EMBASSY, HAVE FLED THEIR </p><p>HOME COUNTRIES, ARE UNABLE TO RETURN HOME DUE TO FEAR OF </p><p>PERSECUTION, AND DUE TO SECURITY OR OTHER SERIOUS ISSUES </p><p>IN THE COUNTRY OF ASYLUM MAY BE IN NEED OF THIRD COUNTRY </p><p>RESETTLEMENT. AN EMBASSY MAY CHOOSE TO CONSULT WITH THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT, OTHER INVOLVED POSTS (SUCH AS IN THE COUNTRY </p><p>OF ORIGIN) OR UNHCR. ANY SUCH COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE </p><p>HANDLED WITH UTMOST DISCRETION. VIOLATING THE </p><p>CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL\'S STATEMENTS AND/OR </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>IDENTITY COULD COMPROMISE THE INDIVIDUAL\'S SAFETY AND THAT </p><p>OF FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. THE CASE MAY </p><p>ULTIMATELY BE DETERMINED BY UNHCR FOR A LOCAL SOLUTION OR </p><p>REFERRAL TO THE U.S. OR OTHER COUNTRY FOR THIRD COUNTRY </p><p>RESETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT AN NGO WORKING IN THE </p><p>REFUGEE\'S COUNTRY OF ASYLUM MAY RAISE A DESERVING CASE </p><p>WITH AN EMBASSY. WHILE THE NORMAL PROCEDURE WOULD BE TO </p><p>REFER THE CASE TO UNHCR OR THE HOST COUNTRY IF THE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL REFUGEE IS NOT KNOWN TO THE EMBASSY, THERE MAY </p><p>BE SITUATIONS WHERE A UNHCR OFFICE IS UNABLE TO ADDRESS </p><p>ADEQUATELY AN INDIVIDUAL CASE. SHOULD THE NGO BE </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING THE NECESSARY ATTENTION FROM </p><p>UNHCR, POSTS ARE FREE TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT TO REFER </p><p>THE CASE AS AN EMBASSY-REFERRAL TO THE U.S. REFUGEE </p><p>ADMISSIONS PROGRAM. ALL POSTS SHOULD DESIGNATE AN OFFICER </p><p>OR ESTABLISH A COMMITTEE RESPONSIBLE FOR VETTING POTENTIAL </p><p>EMBASSY REFERRALS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  WHILE THE SOLUTION FOR MOST REFUGEES IS TO REMAIN IN </p><p>THE COUNTRY OF FIRST ASYLUM UNTIL REPATRIATION IS POSSIBLE, </p><p>EMBASSIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT WITH UNHCR SHOULD THEY </p><p>HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF REFUGEE </p><p>POPULATIONS, INCLUDING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF U.S. REFUGEE </p><p>ADMISSIONS PROCESSING FOR SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS. IT IS NOT, </p><p>HOWEVER, ANTICIPATED THAT POSTS WILL BE CALLED UPON TO </p><p>UTILIZE THEIR RESOURCES TO SCREEN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF </p><p>PERSONS WHO WISH TO BE CONSIDERED FOR U.S. RESETTLEMENT. </p><p>UNHCR OR PRM-FUNDED VOLUNTARY AGENCY STAFF INVOLVED IN </p><p>REFUGEE PROCESSING ALREADY DO THIS AND ARE IN THE BEST </p><p>POSITION TO DEAL WITH HIGH-VOLUME CASELOADS. IN MOST </p><p>CASES, EMBASSY REFERRALS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THOSE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE KNOWN TO THE EMBASSY OR IN WHOM THE </p><p>U.S. HAS A SPECIAL HUMANITARIAN CONCERN AND WHOM THE </p><p>EMBASSY BELIEVES HAVE VALID REASONS TO FEAR PERSECUTION ON </p><p>ACCOUNT OF RACE, RELIGION, NATIONALITY, MEMBERSHIP IN A </p><p>PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP OR POLITICAL OPINION. </p><p> </p><p>13.  PROCEDURES FOR REFERRAL: TO REFER A CASE TO THE U.S. </p><p>REFUGEE PROGRAM, AN EMBASSY SHOULD SEND A CLASSIFIED CABLE </p><p>TO THE OVERSEAS INS OFFICE WITH JURISDICTION FOR THAT </p><p>POST, THE REGIONAL REFUGEE COORDINATOR RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>ADMISSIONS (BANGKOK, CAIRO, MOSCOW, NAIROBI, AND </p><p>ISLAMABAD), THE DEPARTMENT SLUGGED FOR PRM/A, INS </p><p>HEADQUARTERS SLUGGED FOR HQIAO, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY IN </p><p>THE REFUGEE APPLICANT\'S COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. (APPROPRIATE </p><p>COUNTRY, PREF, AND CVIS TAGS SHOULD BE USED.) THE CABLE </p><p>SHOULD INCLUDE BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL APPLICANT AND ANY DEPENDENTS (INCLUDING THEIR </p><p>CURRENT WHEREABOUTS), A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE INDIVIDUAL\'S </p><p>PERSECUTION STORY, AND AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THE CASE </p><p>HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE IN NEED OF THIRD COUNTRY </p><p>RESETTLEMENT. REFCOORD AND INS WILL THEN CONTACT THE POST </p><p>ABOUT THE PROCESSING MODALITIES. </p><p> </p><p>14.  EMBASSIES SHOULD CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT PRM/A AND THE </p><p>EMBASSY IN THE REFUGEE\'S COUNTRY OF ORIGIN (IF APPLICABLE) </p><p>AND REFCOORDS NAIROBI AND CAIRO FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA IF </p><p>THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER A PARTICULAR CASE </p><p>SHOULD BE A PRIORITY ONE EMBASSY REFERRAL. </p><p> </p><p>15.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
