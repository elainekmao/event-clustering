Summary: Five children, a teacher and a secondary school </p><p>principal were injured when Maoists bombed an occupied school </p><p>dormitory in Kathmandu on the evening of December 27.  The </p><p>attack was apparently aimed at the home of the Minister of </p><p>Education, and the local group of insurgents has apologized </p><p>for the \'accidental\' student casualties. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. On the evening of December 27, a bomb exploded near the </p><p>occupied dormitory of East Pole Secondary School in the </p><p>northeastern Jorpati area of Kathmandu Valley.  Five </p><p>children, a teacher and the school principal were injured in </p><p>the blast, with the youngest victim only three years of age. </p><p>Security sources report that the bomb was planted near the </p><p>main entrance to the residence of Education Minister Devi </p><p>Prasad Ojha and was apparently intended to blow up the </p><p>Minister\'s parked car.  The school dormitory is located on </p><p>the same compound as Ojha\'s house. </p><p> </p><p>3. On December 28, Kathmandu newspapers reported that the </p><p>Valley Bureau of the Maoist Liberation Army had released a </p><p>statement claiming responsibility for the bombing, also </p><p>apologizing for the injuries, which were described as an </p><p>"accident."  The press release promised compensation to the </p><p>school and the victims, to be delivered "in due time." </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment: The apology released by the local branch of the </p><p>Maoists is academically interesting, but expressions of </p><p>remorse and promises of compensation by the insurgents are </p><p>far from credible.  Maoist promises have repeatedly and </p><p>consistently been proven false.  Unabated attacks on </p><p>mainstream party workers and infrastructure, despite the </p><p>leadership\'s December 3 pledge to call a moratorium, are only </p><p>the most recent examples.   Claiming that the children </p><p>injured on December 27 were accidental casualties--collateral </p><p>damage of an attack on a GON official--does nothing to </p><p>obviate responsibility for yet another example of innocent </p><p>bystanders victimized by the Maoists\' indiscriminate campaign </p><p>of terror. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
