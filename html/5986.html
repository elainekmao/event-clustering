<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 000477 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW BREED OF HARDLINERS INFLUENCES KABILA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 2/25 E-MAIL HOOKS-BELLAMY/EASTHAM/AMADEO </p><p>     B. KINSHASA 172 </p><p>     C. KINSHASA 447 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF EDWARD BESTIC FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  IN RECENT WEEKS GDRC PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA </p><p>HAS APPROVED SEVERAL ACTIONS WHICH ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF A </p><p>SLOW-BUILDING EVOLUTION TOWARDS HARDLINE POLICIES.  "HAWKISH" </p><p>ADVISERS SUCH AS AUGUSTIN KATUMBA, SAMBA KAPUTO AND EVARISTE </p><p>BOSHAB HAVE GAINED THE ASCENDANCY OVER MORE "MODERATE" </p><p>FIGURES SUCH AS VITAL KAMERHE, ANDRE KAPANGA AND THEOPHILE </p><p>MBEMBA.  KABILA HIMSELF IS NOT AN INNOCENT VICTIM IN THIS </p><p>STORY.  HE HAS NOW SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH A NEW BREED OF </p><p>HARDLINERS--NOT HIS FATHER\'S CRONIES, BUT A YOUNGER, MORE </p><p>SOPHISTICATED GROUP OF HAWKS.  IN THE PAST, KABILA APPEARED </p><p>TO SHOW GREATER APPRECIATION FOR THE LONGER-TERM CONSEQUENCES </p><p>OF HIS CHOICES, IN PARTICULAR THE REACTION OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THESE DAYS, HE IS TAKING HIS </p><p>ADVISERS\' ADVICE SEEMINGLY WITH LESS REGARD FOR THEIR BROADER </p><p>IMPACT, AND APPEARS TO BE MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO STAY IN </p><p>POWER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>INCREASING HARDLINE TENDENCIES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>2. (C) OVER THE PAST YEAR, THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS THAT KABILA </p><p>HAS INCREASINGLY BEEN FAVORING THE VIEWS SHARED BY THE </p><p>"HAWKS" AROUND HIM.  IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS ALONE, THE GDRC </p><p>HAS TAKEN SEVERAL ACTIONS IN LINE WITH THIS MODE OF THINKING. </p><p> EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE ATTEMPT TO EXPEL CONGOLESE LIBERATION </p><p>MOVEMENT (MLC) REPRESENTATIVES FROM KINSHASA IN JANUARY (REF </p><p>B), THE FIRING OF THE FINANCE MINISTER MATANGULU IN FEBRUARY </p><p>(REF C), AND, SINCE LATE 2002, THE DEPLOYMENT OF REGULAR GDRC </p><p>TROOPS TO THE BENI-BUTEMBO REGION--PUTTING THEM BEYOND THE </p><p>LUSAKA CEASEFIRE LINES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN GENERAL, HARDLINERS TEND TO ESPOUSE THE BELIEF THAT </p><p>TIME IS ON KINSHASA\'S SIDE IN THE REUNIFICATION PROCESS, THAT </p><p>THE OPPOSING BELLIGERENTS CAN BE OUTMANEUVERED, OUTLASTED, </p><p>AND PERHAPS EVENTUALLY DEFEATED MILITARILY.  INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRESSURE CAN BE FENDED OFF BY SIGNING AGREEMENTS IN SUN CITY </p><p>AND PRETORIA, BUT ENOUGH OUTSTANDING DISPUTES (SUCH AS OVER </p><p>SECURITY) REMAIN THAT KINSHASA CAN MANIPULATE WITHOUT </p><p>APPEARING TO BE THE HOLDOUT.  IN KEEPING WITH LONGTIME </p><p>CONGOLESE POLITICAL NORMS AND PRACTICES, THESE ADVISERS ARE </p><p>DOUBTLESS MOTIVATED IN NO SMALL PART BY A DESIRE TO KEEP </p><p>THEIR JOBS AND THEIR ACCESS TO WEALTH AND POWER.  DESPITE </p><p>NATIONALIST RHETORIC--MODERATES ARE DENOUNCED AS </p><p>"TRAITORS"--SOME MAY IN FACT PREFER TO RULE UNCHALLENGED IN </p><p>PART OF THE COUNTRY RATHER THAN SHARE POWER WITH OTHERS IN A </p><p>NEW NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WHO HAS KABILA\'S EAR? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>4. (C) OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, KABILA HAS REPLACED A GREAT </p><p>MANY OF THE "OLD GUARD" OF ADVISORS AND MINISTERS APPOINTED </p><p>BY HIS FATHER.  ONCE-POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS MWENZE </p><p>KONGOLO, GAETAN KAKUDJI AND ABDOULAYE YERODIA HAVE LARGELY </p><p>BEEN SIDELINED.  (YERODIA OCCASIONALLY RESURFACES TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT IN HIS BAS-CONGO HOME REGION, AND HAS RECENTLY </p><p>BEEN RUMORED--VERY SPECULATIVELY--AS A POSSIBLE GDRC VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AMONG THE NEWER BREED, THE MOST INFLUENTIAL "HAWKS" </p><p>APPEAR TO BE ON KABILA\'S OWN PERSONAL STAFF: CABINET DIRECTOR </p><p>EVARISTE BOSHAB, DEPUTY CABINET DIRECTOR SAMBA KAPUTO, AND </p><p>PIERRE LUMBI, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC STUDIES.  PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>SPOKESMAN MULEGWA ZIHINDULA, IN A 23 FEB. PRIVATE MEETING </p><p>WITH THE AMBASSADOR, LEVELED CHARGES OF CORRUPTION AT ALL </p><p>THREE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. </p><p> </p><p>--BOSHAB IS FROM KASAI, A LAW PROFESSOR BY TRAINING AND </p><p>BACKGROUND, WHO HAD BEEN DEPUTY CABINET DIRECTOR UNTIL THE </p><p>OCTOBER 2002 SHUFFLE. </p><p> </p><p>--KAPUTO, WHO IS PERHAPS MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN BOSHAB ON </p><p>POLICY MATTERS, WAS BORN IN KATANGA BUT RAISED IN THE KIVUS, </p><p>AND IS A POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR BY TRAINING.  GOVERNOR </p><p>OF BANDUNDU AND ORIENTALE PROVINCES IN THE MOBUTU ERA, HE WAS </p><p>VITAL KAMERHE\'S DEPUTY AT THE GREAT LAKES PEACE COMMISSION </p><p>UNTIL OCTOBER 2002, WHEN HE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD IN HIS CURRENT </p><p>CAPACITY.  HE IS CONSIDERED THE PROTEGE OF AUGUSTIN KATUMBA. </p><p> </p><p>--LUMBI, FROM MANIEMA, WAS AN UNOFFICIAL ADVISER PRIOR TO </p><p>OCTOBER 2002.  AN EARLY CIVIL SOCIETY LEADER (HE FOUNDED A </p><p>SELF-HELP NGO IN 1978 WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS WERE STILL </p><p>TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL), HE BECAME ETIENNE TSHISEKEDI\'S FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER IN 1992-3 AND THEN POST & COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER IN </p><p>THE KENGO WA DONDO GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THESE FORMAL ADVISERS IS </p><p>AUGUSTIN KATUMBA, WHO WAS MINISTER OF THE PRESIDENCY UNTIL HE </p><p>WAS SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER 2002 (FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE </p><p>UN PANEL REPORT ON PLUNDERING THE DRC\'S RESOURCES).  KATUMBA, </p><p>LONG CONSIDERED KABILA\'S RIGHT-HAND MAN, HAS BEEN ACTIVELY </p><p>INVOLVED IN ALL INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE NEGOTIATIONS SINCE </p><p>SUN CITY.  THIS HAS ENABLED HIM TO TRANSLATE THE HARDLINE </p><p>VIEW INTO THE GDRC\'S NEGOTIATING POSITIONS AT THE VARIOUS </p><p>ROUNDS OF TALKS.  CURRENT RUMOR HAS IT THAT HE MAY REPLACE </p><p>JEAN MBUYU AS KABILA\'S SPECIAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND CHIEF OF </p><p>THE COMMITTEE FOR STATE SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) REGARDING MILITARY MATTERS, HERETOFORE KABILA HAS </p><p>LISTENED TO ARMED FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF, LIEUTENANT GENERAL </p><p>LIWANGA MATA, AN EX-FAZ OFFICER.  HOWEVER, HE ALSO LISTENS TO </p><p>ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL FRANCOIS OLENGA AND AIR FORCE </p><p>COMMANDER GENERAL JOHN NUMBI.  OLENGA AND NUMBI ARE SIMILAR </p><p>IN THAT THEY ARE BOTH POLITICAL APPOINTEES WITH NO </p><p>PROFESSIONAL MILITARY BACKGROUND, HAVE VIOLENT STREAKS, AND </p><p>ARE REPUTED TO BE CORRUPT.  THE TWO ARE RIVALS, EACH VYING </p><p>FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL ABROAD ON ARMS-BUYING TRIPS, </p><p>WHICH ENABLES THEM TO SKIM OFF A PERCENTAGE OF ANY SALES </p><p>TRANSACTION.  THEY STAND TO LOSE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AND </p><p>PERHAPS EVEN THEIR JOBS IF THE VARIOUS BELLIGERENTS\' ARMIES </p><p>ARE MERGED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY, AS NOTED </p><p>EARLIER THE FIRING OF FINANCE MINISTER MATANGULU SENT </p><p>SHUDDERS THROUGH THE DONOR COMMUNITY.  UNTIL RECENTLY, </p><p>MATANGULU HAD SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE OVER KABILA THAT ENABLED </p><p>THE FORMER TO "HOLD THE LINE" ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURES.  HIS </p><p>OUSTER--OVER THE ISSUE OF MAINTAINING FISCAL DISCIPLINE--HAS </p><p>RAISED SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GDRC\'S INTENT TO ADHERE TO </p><p>IFI-APPROVED ECONOMIC POLICIES.  IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THERE </p><p>IS ANYONE LEFT AMONG KABILA\'S CLOSE ADVISERS WHO IS PREPARED </p><p>TO CARRY ON MATANGULU\'S ROLE AND PROVIDE SOUND, IF UNPOPULAR, </p><p>ADVICE ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MATTERS.  JEAN-CLAUDE </p><p>MASANGU AS CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR IS STILL MAINTAINING A </p><p>STABLE MONETARY POLICY, HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN FREQUENT </p><p>RUMORS THAT HE HIMSELF IS LESS THAN SQUEAKY CLEAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MODERATES, TAKING A BACK SEAT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>9. (C) THOSE WHO PUBLICLY EXPRESS A MORE "MODERATE" VIEW </p><p>APPEAR TO HAVE WANING INFLUENCE.  SUCH FIGURES INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>--THEOPHILE MBEMBA, CABINET DIRECTOR UNTIL OCTOBER 2002, </p><p>SINCE THEN INTERIOR MINISTER, LED THE GDRC DELEGATION AT THE </p><p>PRETORIA NEGOTIATIONS IN DECEMBER, BUT HAS NOT PLAYED A </p><p>VISIBLE ROLE IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS SINCE. </p><p> </p><p>--ANDRE KAPANGA, FORMERLY LAURENT KABILA\'S PERMREP AT THE UN </p><p>IN NEW YORK, CURRENTLY KABILA\'S POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISER, HAS NOT TAKEN CHARGE OF HIS NEW BRIEF AND ALREADY </p><p>HAS BEEN MARGINALIZED;  HE WAS ILL-INFORMED ABOUT KEY </p><p>DECISIONS SUCH AS THE ABORTIVE MLC EXPULSION ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>--VITAL KAMERHE, LONGTIME CHIEF NEGOTIATORS IN THE INTERNAL </p><p>AND EXTERNAL PEACE PROCESSES, NOW PLAYS SECOND FIDDLE TO </p><p>SAMBA KAPUTO IN THESE TALKS. </p><p> </p><p>--MULEGWA ZIHINDULA, PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN SINCE OCTOBER </p><p>2002, CLAIMS TO BE EAGER TO SEE REFORM BUT HAS NOT </p><p>DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON KABILA\'S DECISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--LEONARD SHE OKITUNDU, FOREIGN MINISTER SINCE LAURENT </p><p>KABILA\'S TIME, CURRENTLY HAS VIRTUALLY NO SAY IN IMPORTANT </p><p>MATTERS.  HIS STAFF HAS COMPLAINED TO EMBOFFS SEVERAL TIMES </p><p>IN RECENT MONTHS ABOUT BEING MARGINALIZED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>10. (C)  OVER THE PAST YEAR, THERE HAS BEEN A SLOW BUT </p><p>SIGNIFICANT EVOLUTION TOWARDS HARDLINE POLICIES ON THE PART </p><p>OF THE GDRC.  KABILA HIMSELF IS NOT AN INNOCENT VICTIM IN </p><p>THIS STORY, HAVING APPOINTED THE VERY ADVISORS TO WHOM HE IS </p><p>CURRENTLY LISTENING.  HE HAS NOW SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH A </p><p>NEW BREED OF HARDLINERS--NOT HIS FATHER\'S CRONIES, BUT A </p><p>YOUNGER, MORE SOPHISTICATED GROUP OF HAWKS.  IN THE PAST, </p><p>KABILA APPEARED TO SHOW GREATER APPRECIATION FOR THE </p><p>LONGER-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF HIS CHOICES, IN PARTICULAR THE </p><p>REACTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THESE DAYS, HE IS </p><p>TAKING HIS ADVISERS\' ADVICE SEEMINGLY WITH LESS REGARD FOR </p><p>THEIR BROADER IMPACT, AND APPEARS TO BE MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE </p><p>TO STAY IN POWER. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p></p></div>
