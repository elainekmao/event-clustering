<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 06961 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA: 1992 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF.:  STATE 338430 </p><p> </p><p>1.  EMBASSY\'S SUBMISSION FOR THE 1992 ANNUAL </p><p>TERRORISM REPORT BEGINS IN PARA TWO BELOW.  RESPONSES </p><p>ARE KEYED TO QUERIES LISTED IN REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN REPORT: </p><p> </p><p>A) PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM:  THERE </p><p>WERE NO PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>B) EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR </p><p>PROSECUTION:  NONE </p><p> </p><p>C) SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION AND/OR </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  THERE ARE NO </p><p>LEGAL IMPEDIMENTS TO THE EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS FROM SRI LANKA.  GSL OFFICIALS CITE </p><p>SEVERAL REASONS FOR NOT RESPONDING TO AN INDIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT REQUEST FOR THE EXTRADITION OF LTTE LEADER </p><p>V. PRABHAKARAN.  THEY EXPLAIN THAT THEIR EFFORTS TO </p><p>CAPTURE PRABHAKARAN HAVE FAILED AND THAT SRI LANKAN </p><p>COURTS HAVE PRIORITY IN TRYING PERSONS CHARGED WITH </p><p>PERPETRATING ACTS OF TERRORISM ON SRI LANKAN SOIL. </p><p>THEY NOTE AS WELL THAT SRI LANKAN SECURITY FORCES ARE </p><p>ENGAGED IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO END LTTE TERRORISM </p><p>AND THAT SRI LANKA IS ONE OF ONLY TWO REGIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENTS TO BRING LOCAL LAW IN LINE WITH A </p><p>REGIONAL ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTION SIGNED BY THE </p><p>SOUTH ASIA ASSOCIATION FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION </p><p>(SAARC). </p><p> </p><p>D) HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: </p><p>THE FIGHT AGAINST LTTE TERRORISM IS A TOP ITEM ON THE </p><p>GSL\'S AGENDA.  ALMOST ALL RESOURCES OF THE SECURITY </p><p>FORCES ARE INVOLVED IN THE ANTI-LTTE EFFORT, WHICH </p><p>INCLUDES NEAR-CONVENTIONAL WARFARE IN SOME PARTS OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY AND CLASSIC COUNTERINSURGENCY FIGHTING IN </p><p>OTHER AREAS.  SINCE THE RENEWAL OF FIGHTING AGAINST </p><p>THE LTTE IN JUNE 1990, THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE MADE </p><p>FREQUENT USE OF SPECIAL POLICE POWERS UNDER THE </p><p>SO-CALLED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS (ER) AND THE </p><p>PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT (PTA).  THESE MEASURES </p><p>PERMIT UNLIMITED PREVENTIVE DETENTION AND SEVERELY </p><p>RESTRICT NORMAL DUE PROCESS RIGHTS INCLUDING BAIL, </p><p>NOTIFICATION OF RELATIVES, AND HABEAS CORPUS. </p><p>(SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE REMAIN IN CUSTODY FOR </p><p>SUSPECTED OFFENSES UNDER THE E.R. AND THE PTA.  THE </p><p>TWO LAWS CAME INTO FORCE DURING THE JVP INSURGENCY OF </p><p>THE LATE EIGHTIES.)  ALTHOUGH SRI LANKA HAS REFUSED </p><p>INDIA\'S REQUEST FOR THE EXTRADITION OF PRABAKHARAN, </p><p>THE SRI LANKAN AUTHORITIES ROUTINELY APPROVE INDIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF RAJIV GANDHI\'S MURDER IN MAY 1991. </p><p> </p><p>GIVEN ITS OWN PROBLEMS WITH DOMESTIC TERRORISM, THE </p><p>GSL HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ACTIVE IN SUPPORTING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ERADICATE TERRORISM  IN </p><p>1987, SAARC MEMBERS SIGNED A CONVENTION ON THE </p><p>SUPPRESSION OF TERRORISM; THIS CONVENTION WAS </p><p>SPONSORED BY SRI LANKA.  THE GSL ALSO HAS LIVED UP TO </p><p>ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING ICAO </p><p>AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL OR TRAVEL SECURITY </p><p>REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>E) MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN </p><p>1992:  SEE ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>F) SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM:  THE GSL RECOGNIZES THE PLO </p><p>AND PERMITS THE GROUP TO MAINTAIN A SMALL MISSION IN </p><p>COLOMBO. </p><p> </p><p>G) HOST-GOVERNMENT STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON TERRORISM ISSUES: </p><p>NONE. </p><p> </p><p>H) SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1991:  NONE </p><p> </p><p>I) COMPLIANCE WITH UN RESOLUTIONS ON LIBYA:  THE GSL </p><p>HAS ANNOUNCED THAT ALL UN MEMBERS HAVE AN OBLIGATION </p><p>TO CARRY OUT EACH OF THE ORGANIZATION\'S RESOLUTIONS </p><p>ON LIBYA.  DESPITE THIS STATEMENT, THE GSL HAS </p><p>DECLINED EITHER TO CLOSE THE LOCAL LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S </p><p>BUREAU OR TO ORDER A REDUCTION IN ITS SIZE. </p><p> </p><p>SCHAFFER </p><p></p></div>
