(A) KATHMANDU 1772 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1762 </p><p>     C. (C) 120813Z SEP 02 </p><p>     D. (D) STATE 175352 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL PMAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In a September 12 meeting, King Gyanendra assured the </p><p>Ambassador that he would not use his constitutional authority </p><p>to intervene in the government unless he gains public </p><p>national consensus on the move from all mainstream political </p><p>parties and unless all other constitutional remedies were </p><p>exhausted.  That time has not yet arrived.  He emphasized </p><p>that he would take such action only to preserve, rather than </p><p>undermine, democracy.  Given the fractiousness and </p><p>self-interest that motivates many political leaders, the </p><p>King\'s refusal to act unless he has full public national </p><p>consensus is wise.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>NOT YET TIME FOR ACTION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  On the evening of September 12, at the Palace\'s </p><p>request the Ambassador called on King Gyanendra.  Ambassador </p><p>opened the meeting by giving the King the text of President </p><p>Bush\'s message of thanks for Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>support in the global campaign against terrorism (Ref C). </p><p>The King was quite pleased by the letter and asked the </p><p>Ambassador to convey his thanks to the White House. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The King asked for the Ambassador\'s assessment of the </p><p>state of affairs in Nepal.  The Ambassador described the </p><p>situation as dire and expressed sympathy for the victims of </p><p>recent Maoist attacks.  He noted that during his meeting with </p><p>Prime Minister Deuba earlier in the day (Ref A) the PM had </p><p>seemed worried for several reasons, including recent Maoist </p><p>successes in the field, ongoing intra-party strife, rumors of </p><p>corruption surrounding his closest advisors, and fear that he </p><p>may have lost the confidence of the King.  The King </p><p>acknowledged that Deuba is under significant pressure, adding </p><p>that he had met the PM just the day before. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Many people are claiming that "I\'ll do something" to </p><p>intervene, the King acknowledged, adding that numerous </p><p>individuals across the political spectrum had come to see him </p><p>recently to ask him to act.  He emphasized that any action he </p><p>would take would be to preserve democracy, not to undermine </p><p>it.  He plans to do nothing, however, until all existing </p><p>constitutional remedies are exhausted.  That point has not </p><p>yet been reached.  Despite the obvious problems that are </p><p>making elections appear less and less feasible, the King </p><p>assured the Ambassador that he will not act unless he obtains </p><p>public consensus from all the major political parties to </p><p>support such action.  So far, no one has been willing to say </p><p>anything in public, he noted.  "They want me to act on my </p><p>own" so that they criticize the move later if it suits their </p><p>political aims. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>CONSENSUS GOVERNMENT ENVISIONED </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Should the King obtain such national consensus and </p><p>invoke his constitutional authority to intervene, the </p><p>Ambassador asked, what might an interim government look like? </p><p>    The King replied that he envisions a national consensus </p><p>government, with representation from all political parties. </p><p>With the support of such national consensus, even the Maoists </p><p>might be invited to participate, provided they laid down </p><p>their arms first.  Contrary to current rumors--and the PM\'s </p><p>own fears (Ref A)--the King said he had no particular person </p><p>in mind to head such a government.  Instead, the person </p><p>should be chosen by the leaders of all the political parties </p><p>to ensure national consensus. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Ambassador delivered Ref D talking points, </p><p>emphasizing that elections should be pursued if at all </p><p>possible, and stressing that any action taken by the King </p><p>should be done in strict accord with constitutional </p><p>provisions and supported by broad political consensus.  The </p><p>King agreed that he should first seek advice from the Supreme </p><p>Court before taking any action.  (Note:  According to the </p><p>British Ambassador, who met the King one hour earlier, the </p><p>King disagreed when the UK Ambassador made the same point, </p><p>reportedly arguing that he had no need to consult the Court. </p><p>The British Ambassador\'s talking points for his meeting with </p><p>the King were virtually identical to ours.  End note.)  He </p><p>noted again that he did not contemplate action soon, but said </p><p>that people should not be surprised if they wake up one </p><p>morning and read about it in the newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>PM SHOULD CLEAN HOUSE FIRST </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The King described the Prime Minister as "overly </p><p>concerned."  The only words of caution he has given Deuba so </p><p>far is that "he should be clean."  The Ambassador pointed out </p><p>that many of the most powerful and influential members of the </p><p>PM\'s cabinet are also those tainted by corruption, and </p><p>suggested that Deuba may be reluctant to alienate them.  The </p><p>King said he had assured Deuba if he cleans up his Cabinet, </p><p>he could guarantee that the (ostensibly autonomous) </p><p>anti-corruption commission would defer investigating the </p><p>ousted ministers for a year.  The Prime Minister is a good </p><p>man, the King reflected, but he seems to be poorly advised. </p><p>He needs to plan more ahead.  Instead, he is too narrowly </p><p>focused on intra-party power struggles.  He has not thought </p><p>ahead, for example, on what he will do if the Election </p><p>Commission decides not to award his faction use of the Nepali </p><p>Congress Party symbol during elections.  The PM\'s wife, Arzu </p><p>Deuba, could be a source of good advice for him, the King </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The King is clearly considering taking action, but </p><p>is wisely waiting for broad-based and public cover before </p><p>doing so.  A tacit consensus seems to be mounting that the </p><p>elections cannot be held for security reasons, and royal </p><p>intervention could provide a face-saving way out for </p><p>politicos unwilling to risk life and limb on the campaign </p><p>trail.  But if the leaders of various political parties have </p><p>decided among themselves that elections are not feasible and </p><p>are hoping for the King to give them a way, they will have to </p><p>come together publicly to ask him to do so.  If elections </p><p>indeed cannot be held, a national consensus government, </p><p>headed by a person chosen by all mainstream political </p><p>parties, may be the best interim option available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
