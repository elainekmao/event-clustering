<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001529 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT OF JORDAN SOCIETY FOR CITIZENS\' RIGHTS </p><p>LOSES COURT ACTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 AMMAN 6521 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 02 AMMAN 6154 </p><p>     C. 02 AMMAN 5576 </p><p>     D. 02 AMMAN 974 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  Jordan Society for Citizens\' Rights </p><p>President Fawzi Samhoury has lost on his court action to have </p><p>the JSCR reinstated as a society recognized by Jordanian law. </p><p> On March 6 the Higher Court of Justice notified Samhoury at </p><p>a court session that his case against the decision of the </p><p>Ministry of Interior to dissolve the JSCR was denied. </p><p>According to Samhoury, he has now exhausted all legal options </p><p>and plans to wait until the summer before deciding how best </p><p>to pursue his human rights work. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>SAMHOURY LOSES COURT ACTION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  On March 11 PolOff met with a clearly disenchanted </p><p>Samhoury.  The Higher Court of Justice informed Samhoury\'s </p><p>attorney at a March 6 session that Samhoury\'s action to stay </p><p>the Ministry\'s decision to dissolve the JSCR had been denied. </p><p> The Ministry of Justice dissolved the JSCR in October 2002, </p><p>citing JSCR non-compliance with financial reporting </p><p>requirements as the basis for the action (reftels).  Samhoury </p><p>did not attend the March 11 session, and said the court will </p><p>mail his attorney a written decision in a couple of weeks. </p><p>According to Samhoury, Legal options are now exhausted.  He </p><p>believes the Higher Court of Justice\'s decision to confirm </p><p>the dissolution of the JSCR was politically driven. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>WHAT TO DO NEXT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Samhoury said he is not sure what to do next.  He is </p><p>clearly disappointed at the demise of his four year old JSCR. </p><p> As he sees himself as one of the few independent human </p><p>rights activists in Jordan, he has rejected suggestions that </p><p>he join other human rights NGOs here.  He plans to wait until </p><p>the summer and decide if he will try to push forward with a </p><p>new society.  He is almost sure that the Ministry of Interior </p><p>will reject any such attempt.  On the GOJ\'s newly created </p><p>human rights commission, Samhoury was dismissive.  "They are </p><p>all government people or weak people.  I wrote Ahmad Obeidat </p><p>(former PM and newly named ombudsman for the Human Rights </p><p>Commission) a letter about my case a few months ago and he </p><p>ignored me."  Cynicism aside, Samhoury said he would probably </p><p>file a complaint with the new commission once it is up and </p><p>running.  Samhoury also plans to continue his communication </p><p>with Amnesty International and European media correspondents </p><p>here. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Although his case received extensive media coverage </p><p>at the outset, attention has dwindled.  There was no media </p><p>coverage of the March 6 court session, with all eyes trained </p><p>on the potential military action in Iraq.  Given Samhoury\'s </p><p>dedication, we expect him to continue to push forward with </p><p>his human rights activism, despite the unfavorable court </p><p>ruling. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
