During October 2002, the World Food Programme (WFP) </p><p>distributed 22,495 metric tons (MT) of food commodities, </p><p>falling short of its planned distribution of 33,060 MT. </p><p>Nevertheless, because of increased food insecurity in </p><p>Zimbabwe, WFP is expanding its targeted number of </p><p>beneficiaries from 1.9 million to 5.8 million, and the </p><p>number of districts covered from 25 to 57.  Due to </p><p>insufficient resources to meet this increased need, WFP </p><p>is projecting a shortfall of 167,169 MT food commodities </p><p>between November 2002 and the end of March 2003.  There </p><p>is currently 61,000 MT of U.S.-donated maize for Zimbabwe </p><p>in or arriving at ports in southern Africa.  Lack of </p><p>sufficient authorized capacity to mill U.S.-donated maize </p><p>into maize meal is severely delaying shipment into </p><p>Zimbabwe and will further compound WFP resource </p><p>constraints.  WFP Country Director doubts that a </p><p>negotiated swap of 17,500 MT maize with the Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s Grain Marketing Board will take place.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>OCTOBER DISTRIBUTION FALLS SHORT OF TARGET </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  During October 2002, WFP and its implementing </p><p>partners (IPs) distributed a total of 22,495 MT food </p><p>commodities for 1.5 million beneficiaries in 25 of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s 57 districts.  This total consisted of 21,537 </p><p>MT maize, 144 MT vegetable oil, 747 MT beans, and 67 MT </p><p>corn-soy blend (CSB).  The distribution fell short of </p><p>WFP\'s target of 33,060 MT and 1.9 million beneficiaries </p><p>because of a fragile pipeline and continued problems with </p><p>the importation of biotech maize.  The cumulative total </p><p>of food aid distributed between April and October is </p><p>78,271 MT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>WFP TO EXPAND DISTRIBUTION TO ALL 57 DISTRICTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Through October 2002, WFP had been targeting the 25 </p><p>districts that had been hardest hit by the food security </p><p>crisis.  WFP\'s original Southern Africa Region (SAR) </p><p>Emergency Operation (EMOP) 10200.0 called for </p><p>distribution to 3.9 million beneficiaries.  To date, due </p><p>to capacity and resource constraints, WFP has been unable </p><p>to meet this target.  Nevertheless, in response to the </p><p>projected increase in food insecurity that was detailed </p><p>in the Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee\'s </p><p>(VAC) Emergency Food Security Assessment Report (dated </p><p>September 16, 2002), WFP intends to expand the number of </p><p>beneficiaries and districts that it is targeting in </p><p>Zimbabwe over the coming months.  During November, WFP </p><p>plans to target 36 districts and 3.0 million </p><p>beneficiaries.  The December target is 44 districts and </p><p>4.5 million beneficiaries.  The January (2003) target is </p><p>for all 57 districts and 5.5 million beneficiaries. </p><p>February and March targets are 57 districts and 5.8 </p><p>million beneficiaries.  NOTE: The difference between </p><p>WFP\'s planned 5.8 million beneficiaries and the VAC </p><p>report\'s estimated 6.7 million eligible Zimbabweans is </p><p>expected to be covered by USAID\'s new parallel NGO </p><p>pipeline (termed C-SAFE) and other lesser bilateral </p><p>activities. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Currently there are ten national and international </p><p>private voluntary organizations (PVOs) with agreements to </p><p>work as Implementing Partners (IPs)of WFP.  The PVOs are </p><p>working/will work in the following districts: </p><p>CARE:  Gweru, Chirumanzu, Gutu, Bikita, Zaka, Masvingo, </p><p>Chivi, Zvishavane, Mberengwa, Mwenezi. </p><p>CHRISTIAN CARE:  Kariba, Guruve, Muzarabani, Rushinga, </p><p>Shamva, Bindura, Mazowe, Zvimba, Buhera, Chimanimani, </p><p>Chipinge. </p><p>CONCERN:  Nyanga, Kwekwe, Gokwe. </p><p>CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES:  Makonde, Chegutu, Kadoma. </p><p>GOAL:  Hurungwe, Makoni. </p><p>HELP AGE ZIMBABWE:  Nkayi. </p><p>LUTHERAN DEVELOPMENT SERVICES:  Shurugwi. </p><p>ORAP:  Hwange, Tsholotsho, Umzingwane, Insiza. </p><p>PLAN INTERNATIONAL:  Mutasa, Mutare. </p><p>WORLD VISION:  Mount Darwin, Mudzi, Mutoko, Murehwa, </p><p>Goromonzi, Marondera, Chitungwiza Seke, Wedza, Chikomba, </p><p>Chiredzi, Beitbridge, Gwanda, Matobo, Bulilimamangwe, </p><p>Bulawayo, Bubi, Lupane, UMP. </p><p> </p><p>5. NOTES: (1) The more recently approved IPs, such as </p><p>CONCERN, GOAL and CRS, will only commence distributions </p><p>in their respective assigned districts in November and </p><p>December.  (2) While World Vision (WV) is an IP of WFP, </p><p>their activities in Beitbridge and Bulilimamangwe </p><p>Districts are being resourced through a USAID bilateral </p><p>Title II program.  (3) To date, the Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe (GOZ) has prohibited Save the Children </p><p>Federation/UK (SCF-UK) from working as an IP of WFP in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Following extensive negotiation with the GOZ, </p><p>SCF-UK has finally received formal GOZ approval to resume </p><p>bilateral food distributions in the Binga District, </p><p>however, not as an IP of WFP.  SCF-UK food distributions </p><p>in Binga are expected to begin this week. (4) The Mission </p><p>received notification this week that Action Against </p><p>Hunger and the German NGO HELP had also received GOZ </p><p>approval to participate in WFP program operations in </p><p>Zimbabwe, bringing the new total number of approved WFP </p><p>NGO IPs to 12 (plus SCF-UK\'s bilateral program in Binga </p><p>noted above). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>WFP HAS INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO MEET NEEDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6.  Even though WFP is planning to expand the number of </p><p>beneficiaries and districts covered by its operations, it </p><p>does not have sufficient resource commitments to meet the </p><p>projected needs.  For example, CD Farrell noted that WFP </p><p>currently has only 16,000 MT of commodities in Zimbabwe, </p><p>less than one month\'s supply.  As a result, WFP is </p><p>projecting a shortfall of 167,169 MT of food commodities </p><p>between November 2002 and the end of March 2003.  The </p><p>total shortfall consists of 88,003 MT cereals, 22,429 MT </p><p>pulses, 4,775 MT vegetable oil, and 51,962 MT corn-soy </p><p>blend (CSB).  The projected monthly shortfall of cereals </p><p>is as follows (in MT): November - 2,644; December - </p><p>27,350; January (2003) - 22,450; February - 21,862; and </p><p>March - 13,697.  Under these circumstances, Kevin </p><p>Farrell, Country Director (CD) of WFP\'s operations in </p><p>Zimbabwe, admits that WFP\'s expanded beneficiary numbers </p><p>noted above are "ambitious targets", considering the </p><p>current import delays and resource constraints. </p><p> </p><p>7.  To date, WFP\'s Southern Africa Region (SAR) Emergency </p><p>Operation (EMOP) 10200.0 for Zimbabwe has been 48.8 </p><p>percent resourced, receiving USD 111,952,689 of a </p><p>requested USD 229,390,598.  NOTE:  This cumulative total </p><p>represents a corresponding 250,603 MT of food, or 55% of </p><p>the total requested 452,955 MT of commodities.  END NOTE. </p><p>The United States is the largest single donor to EMOP </p><p>10200.0, having contributed USD 46,700,000 (or 108,864 </p><p>MT), equal to 20.4 percent of the EMOP and 41.7 percent </p><p>of the total contributions to date (as of October 28, </p><p>2002).  EMOP 10200.0 covers the nine-month period July 1, </p><p>2002 to March 31, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>8. Based on received and planned imports, WFP currently </p><p>projects Zimbabwe\'s cereal gap until the next harvest to </p><p>be about the same as that presented in the September VAC </p><p>report - 370,000 MT.  Significantly, this figure is based </p><p>upon 498,000 MT of GOZ imports already received, and </p><p>465,000 MT of additional planned GOZ imports, </p><p>approximately 370,000 MT of which has been confirmed as </p><p>"contracted" by the GOZ to date.  NOTE:  Although </p><p>contracted, most knowledgeable observers remain skeptical </p><p>that all of these additional GOZ imports will actually </p><p>materialize, given the parlous state of the government\'s </p><p>finances.  END NOTE.  This projected gap also presupposes </p><p>195,000 MT of additional WFP imports, plus 62,000 MT of </p><p>additional food imports from USAID\'s C-SAFE and other </p><p>complementary/parallel pipeline sources. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>LACK OF MILLING CAPACITY CAUSES </p><p>U.S. MAIZE TO SIT IN PORTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Currently, large quantities of U.S.-donated </p><p>commodities for the southern Africa region remain in </p><p>regional ports.  Some 37,893 MT U.S.-donated maize </p><p>designated for Zimbabwe sits in the ports of Maputo, </p><p>Mozambique and Durban, South Africa.  Another 23,000 MT </p><p>maize for Zimbabwe is currently arriving in port aboard </p><p>the Liberty Sun, bring the total to about 61,000 MT. </p><p>Because of concerns over the biotech issue, this maize </p><p>must be milled into maize meal and labeled before it can </p><p>be distributed to beneficiaries in Zimbabwe.  In order </p><p>for the maize to be milled in Zimbabwe, the mill must be </p><p>authorized and monitored by the GOZ\'s Biosafety Board. </p><p>To date, only National Food\'s Bulawayo mill, which has </p><p>the capacity to mill up to 12,000 MT per month, has </p><p>received authorization to perform this work.  WFP </p><p>estimates that Zimbabwean mills have the capacity to mill </p><p>at least 50,000 MT per month.  The lack of sufficient </p><p>authorized milling capacity in Zimbabwe is severely </p><p>limiting WFP\'s ability to meet the needs of its program. </p><p>WFP has appealed to the GOZ to expand the list of </p><p>authorized millers to include sites in Harare and Gweru. </p><p> </p><p>10.  In a monthly donors\' meeting in Harare on November </p><p>13, 2002, WFP CD Farrell reported that of 13,000 MT U.S. </p><p>maize delivered to the Bulawayo mill, some 8,000 MT had </p><p>already been milled.  He also reported that WFP had </p><p>visited the mills in South Africa where the Government of </p><p>South Africa had agreed to mill 60,000 MT of U.S. maize </p><p>donated to the regional EMOP 10200.0.  At this time, it </p><p>is not clear when the South African milling-donation will </p><p>take place. </p><p> </p><p>11. Although secondary transport (to mid-stream and final </p><p>distribution points) is not yet a major problem, CD </p><p>Farrell noted that fuel shortages are becoming an </p><p>increasing constraint.  An additional constraint is </p><p>inadequate storage facilities, with commodities stored in </p><p>open air warehouses and tents subject to more rapid </p><p>deterioration from the elements.  On a more positive </p><p>note, he noted that the average waiting time for customs </p><p>clearance at the major Beitbridge border post had been </p><p>reduced from 3 days to 26 hours. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>WFP CD DOUBTS MAIZE SWAP WILL TAKE PLACE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  WFP CD Farrell also reported that he did not believe </p><p>that the planned swap of 17,500 MT of U.S. maize with the </p><p>GOZ\'s Grain Marketing Board (GMB) was likely to take </p><p>place.  Under the terms of the swap agreement, the GMB </p><p>would give 17,500 MT of non-biotech maize in exchange for </p><p>the U.S.-donated maize.  WFP would then distribute the </p><p>whole-kernel maize, while the GMB would mill the U.S.- </p><p>donated maize.  He reported that he did not think that </p><p>the GMB possessed sufficient quantities of maize at this </p><p>time to effect this swap.  Until this swap agreement is </p><p>carried out or terminated, WFP must continue to warehouse </p><p>the 17,500 MT maize at port in readiness should the swap </p><p>move forward. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  At the monthly briefing, WFP CD Farrell\'s </p><p>presentation was a valiant effort to put a positive spin </p><p>on an increasingly difficult country situation.  While </p><p>progress continues on NGO IP approvals, and increased </p><p>geographic coverage and the numbers of beneficiaries </p><p>reached, these positive developments mask a fundamentally </p><p>fragile pipeline exacerbated considerably by import and </p><p>distribution bottlenecks associated with the biotech </p><p>issue.  Until and unless these issues are fully resolved, </p><p>WFP\'s efforts to meet expanding needs in Zimbabwe will </p><p>continue to suffer from significant resource constraints. </p><p>Efforts continue to resolve these issues to final </p><p>satisfaction with the GOZ, so that the program may </p><p>proceed to meet its expanded targets over the coming </p><p>critical months before the next harvest.
