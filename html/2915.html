HANOI 1133   B. HANOI 1165 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  AMBASSADOR DINH THI MINH HUYEN, DIRECTOR </p><p>OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\' DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01169  100714Z </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, TOLD DCM ON MAY 7 THAT THE GVN </p><p>IS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>THE U.S.  SHE BELIEVES THAT THE DIALOGUES ARE USEFUL FOR </p><p>EXPLAINING WHAT SHE TERMED VIETNAM\'S "FAIR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>POLICY" AND FOR PROMOTING MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING.  THE GVN\'S </p><p>POLICY IS TO ASSIST ALL PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>REGION, SHE CLAIMED, BUT SHE ALSO NOTED THAT THE POLICY IS </p><p>NOT ALWAYS IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUES A GOOD OPPORTUNITY </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  AMBASSADOR HUYEN SAID THE GVN VIEWS HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>DIALOGUES AS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN TO OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES ITS POLICIES SO "THEY WILL UNDERSTAND US BETTER." </p><p>IN ADDITION TO DIALOGUES WITH THE U.S., VIETNAM HOLDS </p><p>SIMILAR MEETINGS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION, NORWAY, AUSTRALIA, </p><p>AND CANADA.  "WE\'LL TALK WITH ANY COUNTRY ABOUT HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS," AMBASSADOR HUYEN PROMISED.  IN ADDITION TO THE </p><p>DIALOGUES, VIETNAM "WELCOMES" FOREIGN VISITORS; AMBASSADOR </p><p>HUYEN SAID IT IS A "GOOD IDEA" FOR MORE PEOPLE TO SEE THE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION "FIRST HAND." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  IN RESPONSE TO THE DCM\'S QUESTION CONCERNING HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, AMBASSADOR HUYEN SAID </p><p>THERE IS MUCH "MISLEADING INFORMATION" ABOUT THIS ISSUE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01169  100714Z </p><p>THE GVN\'S POLICY IS TO "IMPROVE AND HELP" THE ETHNIC PEOPLES </p><p>OF THE AREA TO DEVELOP BOTH "ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY." </p><p>AMBASSADOR HUYEN ADDED IT IS "PART OF OUR CONSTITUTION THAT </p><p>ALL NATIONALITIES ARE EQUAL AND THUS ENTITLED TO EQUAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  AMBASSADOR HUYEN ADMITTED THAT, WHILE THE POLICY IN </p><p>PLACE IS FAIR, IMPLEMENTATION HAS NOT ALWAYS SUCCEEDED.  DUE </p><p>TO "VARIOUS PROBLEMS," THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS IS NOT WELL </p><p>DEVELOPED AND REMAINS RATHER "UNATTRACTIVE" TO FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTORS; NONETHELESS, THE GVN IS TRYING HARD TO IMPROVE </p><p>THE LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE IN THE AREA, SHE CLAIMED. </p><p>AMBASSADOR HUYEN POINTED OUT THAT THE GVN PAYS FEES FOR </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY CHILDREN TO ATTEND BOARDING SCHOOLS.  (NOTE: </p><p>ONLY SELECTED CHILDREN ATTEND MINORITY BOARDING SCHOOLS. </p><p>END NOTE.)  "WE WANT TO HELP THEM DEVELOP AND BE EQUAL," SHE </p><p>SAID.  ANOTHER EXAMPLE SHE GAVE OF THE GVN\'S ATTEMPT TO SPUR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IS THE SELECTION OF "1,000 POOR VILLAGES" FOR </p><p>GVN ASSISTANCE IN SECTORS SUCH AS INFRASTRUCTURE, </p><p>ELECTRICITY, WATER, EDUCATION, AND HEALTH CARE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  AMBASSADOR HUYEN ALSO TERMED AS "MISLEADING," </p><p>STORIES ABOUT ETHNIC MINORITY PEOPLE LOSING LAND TO COFFEE </p><p>PLANTATIONS AS A MATTER OF GVN POLICY.  SHE SAID "THERE IS A </p><p>LOT OF HATRED SPREAD BY PEOPLE FROM THE FORMER (SOUTH </p><p>VIETNAMESE) REGIME."  WHILE THE GVN SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO </p><p>CONTROL MIGRATION, NOW PEOPLE ARE FREER TO MOVE AROUND AND </p><p>HENCE MIGRATION IS MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.  ADDRESSING </p><p>THE MONTAGNARD SITUATION SPECIFICALLY, SHE CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>MAIN REASON THE MONTAGNARDS FLED TO CAMBODIA WAS THAT </p><p>"OUTSIDERS" TOLD THEM THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SETTLE IN THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01169  100714Z </p><p>U.S. OR ANOTHER COUNTRY.  THE DCM STRESSED THAT IT WAS </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR THE GVN TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS ETHNIC MINORITIES.  AMBASSADOR HUYEN REITERATED </p><p>THAT, WHILE THERE ARE VARIOUS SOCIOECONOMIC PROBLEMS IN THE </p><p>AREA, THE GVN "WILL CONTINUE ITS POLICY TO HELP THE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY PEOPLE." </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
