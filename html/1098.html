SPECIFICALLY, MSIPA SAID EVERY </p><p>ZANU-PF CANDIDATE WAS ALLOCATED A NUMBER OF "WAR </p><p>VETERANS" IN THEIR AREA TO COERCE PEOPLE INTO SUPPORTING </p><p>THE RULING PARTY\'S CANDIDATE.  MSIPA SAID HE TOO WAS </p><p>GIVEN A GROUP OF OSTENSIBLE WAR VETS (I.E. THUGS) TO </p><p>HELP HIM WIN HIS ELECTION.

MSIPA </p><p>SAID THAT DURING THE REGULAR WEEKLY CABINET MEETINGS </p><p>MENTION WOULD BE MADE OF THIS "SPECIAL COMMITTEE" TAKING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02953  01 OF 02  021048Z </p><p>UP SENSITIVE ISSUES, SUCH AS THE CARE AND FEEDING OF THE </p><p>WAR VETS ON THE OCCUPIED FARMS.  MSIPA SAID HE BELIEVED </p><p>MNANGAGWA AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY, </p><p>SYDNEY SEKERAMAYI, WERE ON THIS COMMITTEE.  THE MINISTER </p><p>OF HOME AFFAIRS, DUMISO DABENGWA, HAD SPOKEN OUT AGAINST </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT-CONDONED POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN CABINET </p><p>MEETINGS, BUT HAD BEEN OVERRULED AND EFFECTIVELY </p><p>SIOELINED ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MSIPA ALSO SAID MUGABE WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED </p><p>IN OVERSEEING THE WORK </p><p> OF THIS "SPECIAL COMMITTEE" AND </p><p>HAD CALLED OUT THE WAR VETERANS TO OCCUPY PRIMARILY </p><p>WHITE-OWNED COMMERCIAL FARMS.  MSIPA ALSO NOTED THAT </p><p>SINCE THE CONTENTIOUS RULING PARTY\'S FEBRUARY CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE MEETING, IN WHICH PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS TOLD </p><p>THAT HE HAD BECOME A PARTY LIABILITY ANO SHOULD PREPARE </p><p>TO LEAVE OFFICE, THERE HAD NOT BEEN ANOTHER MEETING OF </p><p>THAT BODY.

CONSEQUENTLY, NO COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES HAD BEEN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1180 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02953  02 OF 02  021048Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      INL-01   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NRRC-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------5E4A18  021049Z /38 </p><p>P 021052Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6198 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002953 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR AFRICA GAYLE SMITH </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR PDAS POWELL, DAS SCHNEIDMAN, AF/S </p><p>DIRECTOR RENDER AND ZIMBABWE DESK OFFICER GURNEY </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS TO USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, KDEM, EAGR, PINR, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02953  02 OF 02  021048Z </p><p>SUBJECT: MINISTER OF STATE TELLS AMBASSADOR POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE IS ZANU-PF ELECTION STRATEGY </p><p> </p><p>ACQUIRED FOR RESETTLEMENT BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>FAILURE TO PURSUE THAT OFFER.  THIS VIOLENCE COULD, </p><p>HOWEVER, RESULT IN A PROTEST VOTE AGAINST ZANU-PF, THE </p><p>MINISTER SPECULATED.  MSIPA NOTED THAT SOUTH AFRICA AND </p><p>SOME NORDIC COUNTRIES WERE REPORTEDLY TRYING TO IDENTIFY </p><p>FUNDS TO ASSIST ZIMBABWE IN ITS LAND REFORM PROGRAM. </p><p>AMBASSADOR, HOWEVER, INFORMED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD FROM </p><p>THE NORWEGIAN AMBASSADOR THAT HIS COUNTRY HAD NO SUCH </p><p>BAILOUT IN THE WORKS FOR ZIMBABWE AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ADDITIONALLY, THE MINISTER SAID HE OBJECTED TO </p><p>THE OCCUPATION OF VACANT BUILDINGS IN URBAN AREAS BY A </p><p>BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT ORGANIZATION, THE AFFIRMATIVE </p><p>ACTION GROUP (AAG), WHO WERE TAKING THEIR CUE FROM THE </p><p>WAR VETERANS.  MSIPA SAID HE OECLINED TO GET INVOLVED, </p><p>HOWEVER, NOW THAT MINISTER DABENGWA WAS TRYING TO </p><p>RESOLVE THAT SITUATION AND THE AAG WAS NEGOTIATING WITH </p><p>THE LANDLORDS TO PAY A MOOEST RENTAL FEE FOR THOSE </p><p>PROPERTIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND WIDESPREAD HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>VIOLATIONS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.  HE ALSO URGED MSIPA TO </p><p>CONVEY TO HIS GOVERNMENT HOW DAMAGING THE POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE, FARM OCCUPATIONS, AND URBAN SQUATTING WERE TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S INVESTMENT CLIMATE, TOURISM, AND OVERALL </p><p>ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02953  02 OF 02  021048Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MSIPA IS A REASONABLE, COMMITTED, AND HIGHLY </p><p>CREDIBLE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO HAS BEEN FRUSTRATED IN </p><p>DOING HIS JOB AND WHOSE ADVICE HAS APPARENTLY BEEN </p><p>SHUNNED BY THE MORE RAOICAL RULING PARTY MEMBERS.  THUS, </p><p>HE IS POLITICALLY WEAK.  NEVERTHELESS, MSIPA RETAINS </p><p>MUGABE\'S CONFIDENCE AND MAY RETAIN A POSITION IN THE </p><p>OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AFTER THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION.  MSIPA HAS CONFIRMED THE WIDESPREAD BELIEF </p><p>THAT PERPETUATING VIOLENCE IS ZANU-PF\'S ELECTION </p><p>STRATEGY AND THAT IT IS DIRECTED BY MUGABE.  THE </p><p>MINISTER\'S COMMENTS ALSO TRACK THE EMBASSY\'S POSITION </p><p>THAT THE PRESENT FARM OCCUPATIONS ARE NOT ABOUT LAND </p><p>REFORM, BUT RATHER POLITICS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>DELIVER A STRONG MESSAGE THAT THE ELECTION VIOLENCE AND </p><p>ECONOMIC SUICIDE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PURSUING WILL </p><p>MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO RETURN TO BUSINESS AS USUAL AFTER </p><p>THE ELECTION. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
