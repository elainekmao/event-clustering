<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 002067 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, IT, IT PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT:  ITALY\'S UPCOMING LOCAL ELECTIONS:  POLITICS AS </p><p>USUAL </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) ROME 1971  B) ROME 294  C) 02 ROME 0011 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02067  01 OF 02  131444Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  UPCOMING LOCAL ELECTIONS </p><p>INVOLVING A THIRD OF ITALY\'S ELECTORATE ARE UNLIKELY TO </p><p>HAVE MUCH IMPACT ON NATIONAL POLITICS, THOUGH A CASUAL </p><p>OBSERVER WOULD NEVER KNOW IT FROM THE PITCHED MEDIA BATTLES </p><p>BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION.  POLITICIANS ARE MADLY </p><p>SPINNING THE PROJECTED RESULTS, AS THEY WILL THE FINAL </p><p>RESULTS.  THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT WOULD WELCOME A STRONG </p><p>SHOWING TO REAFFIRM ONGOING PUBLIC SUPPORT AS THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S LEGAL PROBLEMS REMAIN FRONT AND CENTER (REF A). </p><p>WE SUSPECT FEW ITALIANS WILL HAVE NATIONAL ISSUES (OR THE </p><p>WAR ON IRAQ) ON THEIR MINDS AS THEY VOTE FOR THEIR LOCAL </p><p>MAYOR OR COUNCIL MEMBER.  THE ITALIAN MEDIA HAS USED </p><p>OCCASIONAL SQUABBLES WITHIN COALITIONS (ESPECIALLY THE </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT GOVERNMENT) AS THEY NEGOTIATE WHEN, WHO AND </p><p>WHERE TO RUN SINGLE CANDIDATES TO HIGHLIGHT POLITICAL </p><p>DISARRAY.  BUT IN TRUTH THE LEAD-UP TO THESE NOT-SO- </p><p>TERRIBLY SIGNIFICANT ELECTIONS HAS BEEN NOT SO TERRIBLY </p><p>SIGNIFICANT.  THE RESULTS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS INDICATIVE </p><p>OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT\'S STAYING POWER.  END SUMMARY </p><p>AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  BETWEEN MAY 18 AND JUNE 23, ITALIAN ELECTORS WILL </p><p>BE CALLED TO VOTE IN A SERIES OF ELECTIONS FOR LOCAL (CITY, </p><p>PROVINCE, AND REGION) OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS IN A NATIONAL </p><p>REFERENDUM. </p><p>--  ON MAY 25-26, ALMOST THIRTEEN MILLION ITALIANS WILL </p><p>VOTE FOR 12 PROVINCIAL COUNCILS AND 495 CITY COUNCILS.  RUN- </p><p>OFF ELECTIONS WILL BE JUNE 8-9.  (NOTE:  ITALIAN ELECTIONS </p><p>NORMALLY ARE HELD FROM SUNDAY MORNING TO THE FOLLOWING </p><p>MONDAY AT MID-DAY, WITH POLLS CLOSING OVERNIGHT.) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02067  01 OF 02  131444Z </p><p>--  A REFERENDUM VOTE ON THE FAMOUS "ARTICLE 18" EMPLOYMENT </p><p>STATUTE GOVERNING FIRING OF EMPLOYEES WILL BE HELD ON JUNE </p><p>15 (REF B AND SEPTEL). </p><p>--  A SUPPLEMENTAL PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION FOR ONE OF THE </p><p>DISTRICTS IN THE LAZIO (ROME) REGION WILL BE HELD JUNE 22- </p><p>23 TO FILL A VACANT SENATE SEAT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ITALY\'S FIVE AUTONOMOUS REGIONS HAVE THE RIGHT TO </p><p>CHOOSE THEIR OWN ELECTION DATES, AND THREE INDEED SET </p><p>THEIRS SEPARATELY.  SARDINIA AND SICILY CHOSE TO KEEP THEIR </p><p>CITY AND PROVINCIAL ELECTIONS ON THE NATIONALLY-SELECTED </p><p>MAY 25-26 DATES.  (NOTE:  ITALY\'S FIVE AUTONOMOUS REGIONS </p><p>ARE VALLE D\'AOSTA, TRENTINO-ALTO ADIGE, AND FRIULI-VENEZIA </p><p>GIULIA, ALL IN THE NORTH, AND THE ISLANDS OF SARDINIA AND </p><p>SICILY.  EACH REGION HAS A DIFFERENT STATUTE GRANTING IT </p><p>CERTAIN RIGHTS, INTER ALIA THAT OF IMPLEMENTING ITS OWN </p><p>ELECTION LAWS.)  ITALY\'S 15 NON-AUTONOMOUS REGIONS ELECT </p><p>THEIR PRESIDENTS CONCURRENTLY (THE NEXT ELECTIONS WILL BE </p><p>IN 2005), AND THOSE ELECTIONS ARE HOTLY CONTESTED BY </p><p>NATIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES, ATTRACT CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION, </p><p>AND REFLECT THE NATIONAL MOOD AND INTERESTS.  THE </p><p>SEPARATELY-HELD ELECTIONS FOR THE AUTONOMOUS REGIONS, </p><p>HOWEVER, ARE LESS SIGNIFICANT NATIONALLY. </p><p>--  ON MAY 18, ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD IN TRENTINO-ALTO </p><p>ADIGE FOR THREE CITY COUNCILS; </p><p>--  JUNE 8 WAS SELECTED BY VALLE D\'AOSTA FOR ELECTIONS FOR </p><p>A NEW REGIONAL PRESIDENT AND ONE CITY COUNCIL; </p><p>-- JUNE 8-9, RESIDENTS OF FRIULI-VENEZIA GIULIA WILL CHOOSE </p><p>A NEW REGIONAL PRESIDENT AND SEVEN CITY COUNCILS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  LOCAL ELECTIONS GENERALLY NEITHER REFLECT NOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02067  01 OF 02  131444Z </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT NATIONAL POLITICS, SINCE ITALIAN </p><p>VOTERS AND CANDIDATES -- LIKE THEIR AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS </p><p>-- TEND TO FOCUS ON LOCAL PERSONALITIES AND ISSUES WHEN </p><p>VOTING FOR THEIR MAYORS AND CITY OR PROVINCIAL COUNCILS. </p><p>THIS SPRING\'S LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE SOMEWHAT LESS SIGNIFICANT </p><p>NATIONALLY THAN MOST, SINCE NO MAJOR CITIES ARE HOLDING </p><p>ELECTIONS.  POLITICIANS, HOWEVER, CAN BE EXPECTED TO SEEK </p><p>TO PORTRAY RESULTS AS A REFERENDUM ON BERLUSCONI AND HIS </p><p>POLICIES.  IF THE CENTER-RIGHT WINS OVERALL, ITS MEMBERS </p><p>WILL ANNOUNCE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS AGAIN SHOWN ITS SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER.  IF THE REVERSE OCCURS, THE CENTER- </p><p>LEFT OPPOSITION WILL TRUMPET THE PUBLIC\'S REJECTION OF THE </p><p>GOI AND ITS LEADER.  IN EITHER CASE, WE SUSPECT, AND MOST </p><p>OF OUR CONTACTS CONCUR, THAT MOST VOTERS WILL THINK LITTLE, </p><p>IF AT ALL, ABOUT BERLUSCONI\'S LEGAL PROBLEMS, ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORM, GOVERNMENT RESTRUCTURING, OR THE WAR IN IRAQ WHEN </p><p>CASTING THEIR VOTE FOR CITY MAYOR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  THIS TENDENCY, COUPLED WITH A TENDENCY FOR THE </p><p>CENTER-LEFT TO BE SOMEWHAT STRONGER IN LOCAL ELECTIONS DUE </p><p>TO BETTER ORGANIZATION AND CANDIDATES, MAY BE EXACTLY WHAT </p><p>BERLUSCONI IS SEEKING TO COMBAT WITH SOME OF HIS RECENT, </p><p>MORE INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC.

(U)  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE JUNE 15 REFERENDUM </p><p>REGARDING CHANGES TO LABOR STATUTE ARTICLE 18 WILL BE FULLY </p><p>ANALYZED SEPTEL.  THIS REFERENDUM WILL BE THE FIRST </p><p>OCCASION FOR ITALIAN CITIZENS TO VOTE FROM ABROAD.  IN THE </p><p>PAST, ITALIANS LIVING ABROAD HAD TO TRAVEL TO ITALY TO </p><p>VOTE, BUT IN DECEMBER 2001 A LAW WAS PASSED TO AMEND THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION, MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR ITALIAN CITIZENS TO </p><p>VOTE FROM ABROAD (REF C) IN NATIONAL-LEVEL ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  THE SENATE SUPPLEMENTAL ELECTION IN LAZIO WILL </p><p>REPLACE CENTER-LEFT SENATOR SEVERINO LAVAGNINI WHO DIED </p><p>RECENTLY.  MOST LIKELY THE SEAT WILL GO TO THE CENTER-LEFT </p><p>AGAIN.  LAVAGNINI WON THE 2001 ELECTION BY A HANDFUL OF </p><p>VOTES WHEN THE CENTER-LEFT OLIVE TREE (ULIVO) COALITION AND </p><p>COMMUNIST RENEWAL (RC) RAN SEPARATE CANDIDATES.  AS THIS IS </p><p>A SINGLE SEAT ELECTION, RC MAY DECIDE TO SUPPORT THE ULIVO </p><p>CANDIDATE, GIVING THE CENTER-LEFT A BETTER CHANCE TO WIN. </p><p>THIS ELECTION WILL NOT CHANGE THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE </p><p>SENATE, IN ANY EVENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02067  02 OF 02  131445Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME02067 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
