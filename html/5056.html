<p>S E C R E T STATE 009334 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/13 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, SY </p><p>SUBJECT: NONPAPER FOR RUSSIAN USE WITH SYRIAN VP KHADDAM: </p><p>HAMAS AND HEZBALLAH </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY NEA A/S BILL BURNS, E.O. 12958 REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST. SYRIAN VP KHADDAM WILL </p><p>BE VISITING MOSCOW NEXT WEEK. IN DISCUSSIONS WITH RUSSIAN </p><p>COUNTERPARTS IN WASHINGTON, THE USG HAS REQUESTED THAT THE </p><p>GOR RAISE SYRIA\'S CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS HAMAS AND HIZBALLAH.   POST IS </p><p>REQUESTED TO PROVIDE THE POINTS AT PARA TWO WITH </p><p>APPROPRIATE GOR OFFICIALS. THE POINTS AT PARA THREE MAY </p><p>BE LEFT AS A NONPAPER. THESE POINTS ARE NOT/NOT </p><p>RELEASABLE TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/REL RUSSIA) BEGIN POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERS SYRIA A STATE SPONSOR OF </p><p>TERRORISM, DUE PRIMARILY TO ITS HOSTING OF CERTAIN </p><p>PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS SUCH AS HAMAS, THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ), THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE </p><p> </p><p> LIBERATION OF PALESTINE (PFLP), AND THE POPULAR FRONT FOR </p><p> THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE - GENERAL COMMAND (PFLP-GC). </p><p> WE ARE CONCERNED AS WELL BY DAMASCUS\' CLOSE RELATIONSHIP </p><p> AND SUPPORT FOR HIZBALLAH. </p><p> </p><p> -- THE EVIDENCE WE ARE PROVIDING YOU TODAY SUPPORTS OUR </p><p>VERY REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF TWO </p><p> ORGANIZATIONS IN PARTICULAR: HIZBALLAH AND HAMAS.      WE </p><p>HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER THIS INFORMATION CAREFULLY AND </p><p> IN SHAPING YOUR BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH COUNTRIES, SUCH </p><p>AS IRAN AND SYRIA, WHICH SUPPORT THEIR ACTIVITIES AND THAT </p><p>RUSSIAN OFFICIALS WILL DRAW ON THESE POINTS DURING THEIR </p><p>MEETINGS NEXT WEEK WITH SYRIAN VP KHADDAM. </p><p> </p><p>END POINTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/REL RUSSIA) BEGIN TEXT OF NON-PAPER: </p><p> </p><p>HIZBALLAH </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERS HIZBALLAH A TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION, ENGAGED IN TERRORIST ACTIONS. WHILE WE </p><p>DON\'T OPPOSE HIZBALLAH\'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES, </p><p>IT IS NOT CREDIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A </p><p>TERRORIST/OPERATIONAL WING OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND A </p><p>POLICY/POLITICAL WING. TO TRY TO DO SO IS A WHOLELY </p><p>ARTIFICIAL EXERCISE AS HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERSHIP OF BOTH </p><p>WINGS IS ONE AND THE SAME. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE DETERMINATION AND ABILITY </p><p>OF HIZBALLAH TO MOUNT TERRORIST OPERATIONS. THESE </p><p>ACTIVITIES HAVE A DESTABILIZING EFFECT ON THE ENTIRE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST REGION AND UNDERMINE INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO </p><p>ESTABLISH CONDITIONS WHEREBY MEANINGFUL PEACE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>CAN RESUME. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIZBALLAH CONTINUES TO RECEIVE WEAPONS FROM IRAN. WE </p><p>ARE CONCERNED THIS CONTINUED RE-SUPPLY INCREASES THE </p><p>LIKELIHOOD THAT HIZBALLAH WILL ACQUIRE LONGER-RANGE AND </p><p>MORE ADVANCED ROCKETS OR MISSILES. THE GROWING STOCKPILE </p><p>MAY LIKEWISE ENHANCE HIZBALLAH\'S PERCEPTION OF ITS </p><p>DETERRENT CAPACITY AND EMBOLDEN IT TO INCREASE BORDER </p><p>ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p> -- THE FINANCIAL, TRAINING, AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT THAT </p><p>HIZBALLAH AND IRAN PROVIDE TO PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS ALSO </p><p>GENERATES SIGNIFICANT CONCERN: </p><p> </p><p>   - HIZBALLAH AND IRANIAN ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD </p><p>    (IRGC) PERSONNEL HAVE CONDUCTED WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES </p><p>   TRAINING FOR MEMBERS OF PALESTINIAN GROUPS IN THE BEKAA </p><p>   VALLEY AND IN IRAN BEFORE SENDING THEM BACK INTO THE </p><p>   PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES </p><p> </p><p>   - HIZBALLAH COORDINATED THE MARCH 12 ATTACK AT SHLOMI IN </p><p>   NORTHERN ISRAEL, IN WHICH SIX ISRAELIS WERE KILLED, </p><p>   INCLUDING FOUR CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>   - HIZBALLAH IS LIKEWISE WORKING TO INFILTRATE ITS OWN </p><p>   OPERATIVES INTO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA TO FACILITATE </p><p>   PALESTINIAN ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELIS. AN OPERATIVE (A </p><p>   SHIA OF LEBANESE ORIGIN) ARRESTED IN HEBRON LAST SUMMER </p><p>   BY THE ISRAELI SECURITY SERVICE WAS TRAINED IN LEBANON </p><p>   AND SENT TO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA TO ENHANCE </p><p>   PALESTINIAN BOMB PRODUCTION AND HELP PLAN ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>   - HIZBALLAH COOPERATED WITH FATAH PALESTINIANS ON THE </p><p>   JANUARY 2002 KARINE A SHIPMENT. THE SHIP WAS CARRYING </p><p>   ROUGHLY 50 TONS OF MOSTLY IRANIAN-MADE WEAPONS - SUCH AS </p><p>   BATTLEFIELD ROCKETS, NUMEROUS LIGHT AND ANTI-TANK </p><p>   MISSILES, MORTARS, MINES, EXPLOSIVES, AND SMALL ARMS AND </p><p>   MUNITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>   - IN MAY 2001, THE PFLP-GC, WITH HIZBALLAH\'S ASSISTANCE, </p><p>   ATTEMPTED TO SMUGGLE 45 SEALED BARRELS OF ARMS BY SEA </p><p>   FROM LEBANON TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. PRESS </p><p>   REPORTS AT THE TIME OF SEIZURE STATED THAT INTERROGATION </p><p>   OF THE CREW SHOWED THE SAME SHIP HAD MADE THREE EARLIER </p><p>   DELIVERIES TO GAZA. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERSHIP HAS CALLED ON ARAB LEADERS TO </p><p>PROVIDE "SERIOUS" MONEY AND WEAPONS TO THE PALESTINIANS. </p><p>IN AN INTERVIEW IN MARCH WITH THE LONDON SUNDAY TIMES, THE </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY OF HIZBALLAH, HASSAN NASRALLAH, ALSO </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THREE HIZBALLAH MEMBERS HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY </p><p> </p><p>THE JORDANIANS AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO SMUGGLE A NUMBER OF </p><p>KATYUSHA ROCKETS TO PALESTINIAN FACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE EFFECT SUCH SUPPORT AND COORDINATION COULD HAVE ON </p><p>THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL IS </p><p>CLEARLY WORRISOME. INCREASED IRANIAN FUNDING AND WEAPONS, </p><p>ALONG WITH TRAINING PROVIDED BY BOTH IRAN AND HIZBALLAH, </p><p>HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASED LETHALITY OF THE CURRENT </p><p>INTIFADA. BY NASRALLAH\'S OWN ADMISSION, BROADCAST ON </p><p>BEIRUT TELEVISION NOVEMBER 26, HIZBALLAH IS "STRONGER </p><p>TODAY THAN IT WAS AT THE TIME" OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF </p><p>ISRAELI TROOPS FROM LEBANON IN 2000. NASRALLAH HAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY AND PUBLICLY CALLED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF </p><p>ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>-- WHILE SOME NATIONS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HAMAS\' POLITICAL </p><p>WING, INCLUDING ITS FUNDRAISING ARM AND ARRAY OF SOCIAL </p><p>SERVICES, AND IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM, ITS OPERATIONAL </p><p>BRANCH, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS </p><p>APPROPRIATE TO DO SO BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THE </p><p>UNITED STATES VIEWS HAMAS AS A UNIFIED ORGANIZATION WITH </p><p>UNIFIED GOALS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE ELIMINATION OF THE </p><p>STATE OF ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>     - HAMAS POLITICAL LEADERS OPENLY LOBBY FOR THE </p><p>     "LIQUIDATION" OF ISRAEL THROUGH VIOLENCE, AS </p><p>     POLITICAL BUREAU CHIEF KHALID MISHA\'AL DID IN TEHRAN </p><p>     ON APRIL 24, 2001. HAMAS SPOKESMAN MOUSA ABU MARZOUK </p><p>     VOWED HAMAS WOULD "STEP UP ITS GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST </p><p>     ISRAEL" AND THIS SUMMER ADMITTED ON THE U.S. </p><p>     TELEVISION SHOW "60 MINUTES" THAT HAMAS WAS </p><p>     DEVELOPING, IN GAZA, ADVANCED ROCKETS TO STRIKE </p><p>     TARGETS INSIDE ISRAEL PROPER. DR. ABDEL RANTISI, </p><p>     ANOTHER PROMINENT HAMAS POLITICAL OFFICIAL, SAID </p><p>     SUICIDE BOMBERS ARE "THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR </p><p>     US." RANTISI PUBLICLY ADMITS THAT IZZ AL-DIN AL- </p><p>     QASSAM INITIATES ATTACKS BASED ON CUES HEARD IN </p><p>     PUBLIC STATEMENTS MADE BY HAMAS POLITICAL FIGURES. </p><p> </p><p>      - IN A MAY 2002 STATEMENT POSTED ON A PROMINENT </p><p>      ARABIC INTERNET SITE, HAMAS MILITARY LEADER SALAH </p><p>      SHIHADA, SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED IN AN ISRAELI TARGETED </p><p>      OPERATION THIS FALL, SAID THAT HAMAS\' "POLITICAL </p><p>      APPARATUS IS SOVEREIGN OVER THE MILITARY APPARATUS, </p><p>      AND A DECISION OF THE POLITICAL ECHELON TAKES </p><p>      PRECEDENCE OVER THE DECISION OF THE MILITARY </p><p>       ECHELON, WITHOUT INTERVENING IN MILITARY </p><p>      OPERATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>      - IN AUGUST 2002, HAMAS\' GAZA-BASED SPIRITUAL LEADER </p><p>      AHMAD YASIN WAS QUOTED AS SAYING, "WHEN WE HAMAS </p><p>      MAKE DECISIONS ON THE POLITICAL LEVEL AND CONVEY THEM </p><p>      TO THE MILITARY WING, IT ABIDES BY IT NORMALLY." </p><p> </p><p>-- PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) LEADERS TELL US HAMAS </p><p>"POLITICAL" LEADERS ARE COMPLICATING THEIR EFFORTS TO </p><p>LIMIT ATTACKS ON ISRAELI TARGETS. IN JANUARY 2002, A </p><p>PROMINENT ARAB NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT PA LEADERS HAD </p><p>ASKED SYRIA-BASED HAMAS LEADERS IMAD AL-ALAMI, MARZUK AND </p><p>MISHA\'AL TO STOP "POURING OIL ON THE FIRE" BY ARMING AND </p><p>FUNDING CELLS IN THE WEST BANK. THE SAME NEWSPAPER </p><p>REPORTED IN JUNE 2002 THAT AL-ALAMI HAD MET WITH </p><p>PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, HIZBALLAH AND AL-QAEDA </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES TO DISCUSS CONDUCTING "MAJOR MARTYRDOM </p><p>OPERATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>-- HAMAS\' NETWORK OF SOCIAL SERVICES SUPPORTS THE </p><p>VIOLENT POLITICAL AMBITIONS OF THE ORGANIZATION, BOTH </p><p>FINANCIALLY AND THROUGH EFFORTS FURTHERING INDOCTRINATION. </p><p> </p><p>      - HAMAS IS SUSPECTED OF DERIVING A LARGE PERCENTAGE </p><p>      OF ITS REVENUE FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE GULF </p><p>      REGION, THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST AND EUROPE. THESE </p><p>      FINANCES UNDERMINE THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS BY </p><p>     PROMOTING HAMAS\' PROPAGANDA AND FACILITATING THE </p><p>     RECRUITMENT AND INDOCTRINATION OF HAMAS ACTIVISTS. </p><p>     SOME OF THESE FUNDS MAY ALSO SUPPORT THE FAMILIES OF </p><p>     "MARTYRS" AND THE EXECUTION OF TERRORIST OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- HAMAS CENTERS ITS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY IN THE </p><p>IMPOVERISHED AREAS OF GAZA AND THE WEST BANK. THERE IT </p><p> </p><p>OPENLY MAINTAINS A DIVERSE ARRAY OF SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>SERVICES, RAISES MONEY, ORGANIZES ACTIVITIES, DISTRIBUTES </p><p>PROPAGANDA AND RECRUITS MEMBERS. SOME RECRUITS ARE </p><p>CLANDESTINELY TRAINED AS SUICIDE BOMBERS FOR SERVICE </p><p>WITHIN IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM, THE GROUP\'S TERRORIST WING. </p><p>HAMAS\' STRONG INFLUENCE IN MANY PALESTINIAN MOSQUES, </p><p>SCHOOLS AND SOCIAL CLUBS CONTRIBUTES TO THE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO INDOCTRINATE THE PALESTINIAN CONSTITUENCY WITH </p><p>ITS VIOLENT IDEOLOGY, PARTICULARLY ITS YOUTH, AND PROVIDES </p><p>RELIGIOUS SANCTION TO VIOLENCE AGAINST ISRAELIS. </p><p> </p><p>      - HAMAS "POLITICAL" LEADER MISHA\'AL ON NOVEMBER 16, </p><p>      2000 WAS QUOTED IN THE ARAB DAILY AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT </p><p>      AS SAYING, "HAMAS IS A JIHAD MOVEMENT THAT SERVES THE </p><p>      PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND THE CURRENT INTIFADA. </p><p>      EVERYTHING HAMAS OWNS IS USED IN THIS BATTLE." </p><p> </p><p>-- HAMAS POSES AN UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY THREAT TO THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WHICH THE UNITED STATES </p><p>VIEWS AS CRITICAL TO ITS NATIONAL SECURITY, FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>AND/OR ECONOMIC INTERESTS, THROUGH THE INCITEMENT OF </p><p>TERRORISM AND OVERT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES: </p><p> </p><p>     - THE UNITED STATES HAS INFORMATION INDICATING THAT </p><p>     HAMAS\' POLITICAL BUREAU OFTEN HAS FOREKNOWLEDGE OF, </p><p>      IS LINKED TO, AND/OR PROVIDES DIRECTION FOR THE </p><p>     OPERATIONS OF IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM AGAINST ISRAELI </p><p>     TARGETS.   MOST RECENTLY, HAMAS CLAIMED </p><p>     RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JULY 2002 BOMBING AT </p><p>     JERUSALEM\'S HEBREW UNIVERSITY THAT KILLED FOUR </p><p>     ISRAELIS AND FIVE AMERICAN CITIZENS AND THE MARCH </p><p>     2002 SUICIDE BOMBINGS THAT KILLED 25 ISRAELIS ON </p><p>     PASSOVER NIGHT IN NETANYA, ISRAEL, AND 15 ISRAELIS AT </p><p>     A HAIFA CAFE THE SAME WEEK. SIMILARLY DEVASTATING </p><p>     ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT IN 2001, SUCH AS THE JUNE 1 </p><p>     BOMBING OF A TEL AVIV NIGHTCLUB THAT KILLED 22 </p><p>     ISRAELI TEENAGERS, AND THE AUGUST 9 SUICIDE ATTACK ON </p><p>     A JERUSALEM PIZZERIA IN WHICH 15 CIVILIANS DIED. </p><p>     AMERICAN CITIZENS AND OTHER NON-ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN </p><p>     KILLED AND INJURED IN THESE AND OTHER ATTACKS. HAMAS </p><p>     SPOKESMEN, INCLUDING PURPORTED "POLITICAL" LEADERS, </p><p>     CATEGORIZE THESE OPERATIONS AS "SELF-DEFENSE" - PART </p><p> </p><p>      OF ITS DECLARED POLICY TO CREATE A "BALANCE OF </p><p>      TERROR" WITH ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>-- HAMAS IS ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND ITS </p><p>AFFILIATION WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS CONSTITUTES A THREAT TO AMERICAN AND WESTERN </p><p>INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND: </p><p> </p><p>      - HAMAS OPERATES THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. FOR </p><p>      PURPOSES OF TRAINING, FUND-RAISING AND CONSULTING </p><p>      WITH FOREIGN OFFICIALS AND OTHER TERRORISTS </p><p>      ORGANIZATIONS, HAMAS IS KNOWN OR BELIEVED TO HAVE A </p><p>      PRESENCE IN IRAN, LEBANON, LIBYA, SAUDI ARABIA, </p><p>      SUDAN, YEMEN AND SYRIA (IT MAINTAINS ITS HEADQUARTERS </p><p>      IN DAMASCUS). FOUR OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE LISTED BY </p><p>      THE USG AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. HAMAS IS </p><p>      ALSO ACTIVE IN OTHER NATIONS. FURTHER, HAMAS MAY </p><p>      ASPIRE TO DESTABILIZE THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY IN </p><p>      THE EVENT OF ARAFAT\'S DEATH. </p><p> </p><p>      - HAMAS IS BELIEVED TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER FOREIGN </p><p>      TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OF GLOBAL REACH, INCLUDING </p><p>      HIZBALLAH. ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, HAMAS AND </p><p>      HIZBALLAH HAVE COOPERATED ON WEAPONS ENHANCEMENT AND </p><p>     DEVELOPMENT FOR USE WITHIN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>      TERRITORIES. HAMAS IS ALSO KNOWN TO MAINTAIN CLOSE </p><p>      TIES WITH IRAN. HAMAS\' AFFILIATION WITH THESE </p><p>     TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH ARE TOGETHER </p><p>      RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN </p><p>     CITIZENS, AND IRAN (A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM) </p><p>     CONSTITUTES A GROWING THREAT TO AMERICAN AND WESTERN </p><p>     INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
