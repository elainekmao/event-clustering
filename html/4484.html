Reasons:  1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (c) As reported reftel, we received a copy of a letter </p><p>sent by MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai to South African </p><p>President, Thabo Mbeki.  The letter was delivered in person </p><p>to President Mbeki\'s office by Tsvangirai\'s special advisor. </p><p>As of November 20, Tsvangirai had not yet received a response. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) Begin Text of Tsvangirai-Mbeki letter: </p><p> </p><p>8th November, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>His Excellency </p><p>President Thabo Mbeki </p><p>Republic of South Africa </p><p> </p><p>I greet you in the name of African brotherhood. </p><p> </p><p>Your Excellency, I write to you to raise a few issues of </p><p>concern to ourselves as party to the dialogue co-sponsored by </p><p>yourselves and President Obasanjo.  I want to believe that we </p><p>all accept that there is a political crisis in Zimbabwe </p><p>emanating from the presidential election that was not </p><p>conducted in a free and fair manner.  Your Excellency as </p><p>member of the Commonwealth troika are party to the March 2002 </p><p>decision of the organization to suspend Zimbabwe, </p><p>(government), from the councils of the same resulting from </p><p>its failure to uphold certain principles concerning the </p><p>conduct of elections. </p><p> </p><p>We in the party salute your decision and indeed your boldness </p><p>to arrive at it.  Indeed the election in Zimbabwe was not </p><p>free and fair and the political crisis in the country is </p><p>about a stolen election and is therefore a crisis of </p><p>legitimacy. </p><p> </p><p>In-spite of the outcome we further salute your intervention </p><p>through the inter-party dialogue initiative, which without </p><p>your wisdom would not have taken place.  The crisis of </p><p>legitimacy in Zimbabwe remains compounding the crisis of </p><p>governance that has been with us for some time now.  The very </p><p>acceptance by the parties to enter into dialogue on the </p><p>agreed agenda is a recognition that there is a political </p><p>crisis in the country needing resolution through dialogue.  I </p><p>still believe that dialogue is ultimately inevitable to the </p><p>resolution of the crisis in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>Your Excellency while appreciating your role in trying to </p><p>resolve the crisis in Zimbabwe I wish to raise here two </p><p>issues of concern to us in the party. </p><p> </p><p>Firstly, I note that since the inter-party dialogue stalled </p><p>many South African government delegations have visited </p><p>Zimbabwe engaging the ZANU(PF) government.  The last such </p><p>delegation was led by Foreign Minister, Nkosazana Zuma, not </p><p>too long ago. </p><p> </p><p>We in the party do not mind your continued engagement of the </p><p>government on the various issues concerning the political </p><p>crisis in the country.  However, we believe that if Your </p><p>Excellency recognizes that the political crisis in the </p><p>country still persists and that you still consider yourself </p><p>as an impartial broker to the resolution of the crisis then </p><p>South African government delegations to the country engaging </p><p>the ZANU(PF) government should also take the courtesy of at </p><p>least allowing a briefing from ourselves as party to the </p><p>effort to finding a resolution of the crisis.  I believe that </p><p>the failure by the various South African government </p><p>delegations to engage our party compromises your image as an </p><p>impartial broker. </p><p> </p><p>Secondly, I note with concern the statement by Foreign </p><p>Minister, Nkosazana Zuma, during her last visit to Zimbabwe </p><p>in which she says that South Africa does not see any signs of </p><p>a looming bloodbath in Zimbabwe.  I want to believe that her </p><p>statement was irresponsible.  We in the party have made all </p><p>efforts and against all odds to contain public anger by </p><p>counseling patience on a restless population.  But we could </p><p>be reaching a stage where that may no longer be possible </p><p>especially given the increasing arrogance of the ZANU(PF) </p><p>government on the one hand and the growing impatience of the </p><p>masses on the other hand.  I want to believe that the </p><p>Minister\'s statement is unfortunate and therefore should be </p><p>withdrawn. </p><p> </p><p>Your Excellency, the Zimbabwe crisis is real and needs </p><p>resolution rather than management. </p><p> </p><p>I avail myself, Your Excellency, this opportunity to renew </p><p>the assurances of my highest consideration. </p><p> </p><p>Yours Sincerely, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai </p><p>President </p><p>End Text </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
