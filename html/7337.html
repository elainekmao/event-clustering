<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001036 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/CA </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/IMI - HARLOW, MATHIEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, CA, PBIO, Finance, Bank of Canada </p><p>SUBJECT: BANK OF CANADA PROMOTES FROM WITHIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Bank of Canada\'s April 9 announcement that Paul </p><p>Jenkins will be promoted to Senior Deputy Governor reverses a </p><p>recent trend of drawing on outside talent for top leadership. </p><p> Jenkins, a Deputy Governor for 10 years, had been a </p><p>front-runner for the SDG job in 1999, but was edged out by </p><p>Malcolm Knight.  (Knight left to assume the top job at the </p><p>Bank for International Settlements earlier this month.)  The </p><p>promotion makes Jenkins a member of the BOC Board of </p><p>Directors and a strong contender to eventually replace David </p><p>Dodge as Governor (if Dodge does not continue when his 7-year </p><p>term expires in about five years.)  Dodge, too, was selected </p><p>from outside the BOC. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The choice of Jenkins had been leaked earlier in the </p><p>week. His promotion leaves the BOC with two Deputy Governor </p><p>jobs to fill (Charles Freedman is retiring at the end of </p><p>August), and both internal and external candidates are under </p><p>consideration.  A decision on those jobs is expected "soon" </p><p>and the choice is expected to signal the BOC\'s future </p><p>direction.   Deputy Governor appointments, unlike the </p><p>Governor and the Senior Deputy, do not require Cabinet </p><p>approval. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Jenkin\'s promotion, which takes effect immediately, has </p><p>been positively received and economists believe it reinforces </p><p>the BOC\'s priorities of transparency and maintaining an </p><p>aggressive stance on inflation.  Jenkins has focussed on </p><p>international economics (and hosted the Bank\'s biannual </p><p>briefings for G-7 financial attaches on the Monetary Policy </p><p>Report). </p><p> </p><p>4.  Jenkins, 55, joined the Bank\'s research department in </p><p>1972.  In 1978 he transferred to the Department of Monetary </p><p>and Financial Analysis, becoming Deputy Chief in 1983, Chief </p><p>of the Research Department in 1984, and Advisor to the </p><p>Governor in 1989.  Jenkins graduated from the University of </p><p>Western Ontario, and received a Masters in Political Science </p><p>from the London School of Economics.  He studied at Princeton </p><p>from 1982-83 before returning to the Bank.  He was born in </p><p>St. Catharines, Ontario, and he and his wife Sheila have </p><p>three children. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
