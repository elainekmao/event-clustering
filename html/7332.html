<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000662 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, PINS, IV, LI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CHAMBAS BRIEFING ON ECOWAS MINISTERIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 88288 </p><p>     B. ABIDJAN 817 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. On April 9, ECOWAS ExecSec Chambas briefed the </p><p>diplomatic corps on the April 7 ECOWAS Ministerial in </p><p>Abidjan.  The briefing was similar to the one he gave in </p><p>Abijdan (REF B).  Stressing the need for immediate funding </p><p>to ensure ECOMICI\'s continued viability, Chambas stated </p><p>that he would join a quintet of ECOWAS Foreign Ministers </p><p>(Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d\'Ivoire, and Guinea) to </p><p>tour potential donor countries starting April 28.  See </p><p>travel itinerary in paragraph 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On a pull aside after the briefing, A/DCM delivered </p><p>demarche to Chambas (REF A).  A/DCM commented that ECOWAS </p><p>should perhaps consider amending the travel schedule to </p><p>include a donor conference.  As developed, the schedule </p><p>would not accommodate the conference until late May at the </p><p>earliest and most likely not until June.  Chambas was </p><p>receptive to the idea of scheduling an earlier donor </p><p>conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Travel intinerary: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>APRIL 28 - UN Headquarters (UNSC and UNSYG) </p><p>APRIL 29 - Washington, D.C. </p><p>APRIL 30 - Ottawa </p><p>MAY 2 - Paris </p><p>MAY 3 - Brussels </p><p>MAY 5 - Berlin </p><p>MAY 6 - The Hague </p><p>MAY 7 - Rome </p><p>MAY 8 - London </p><p>MAY 12 - Mediation and Security Council, Abidjan </p><p>MAY 13 - Extraordinary Summit of ECOWAS, Abuja </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tentative trip to Tokyo scheduled after the ECOWAS </p><p>summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Washington is scheduled for an April 29 visit.  Chambas </p><p>said that he would provide the U.S. and other donors with a </p><p>breakdown of the ECOWAS budget request prior to beginning </p><p>the donor capital tour. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>LIBERIA </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.    Chambas said he had just come from a meeting with </p><p>LURD representatives in Abuja.  The LURD representatives </p><p>would next travel to Accra to meet President Kufuor on </p><p>April 10.  Chambas noted that ECOWAS is considering asking </p><p>one of two former Nigerian Heads of State to mediate </p><p>between the GOL and the LURD (Chambas had previously </p><p>mentioned Abdulsalaam to us; Chief Shonekan would be our </p><p>educated guess as the other half of the tandem.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Chambas\' statement that ECOMICI would increase to </p><p>3,205 soldiers and expand its mandate to include monitoring </p><p>of borders, disarmament, and protection of CDI officials </p><p>raises questions of whether a force of this size can handle </p><p>a mandate of this scope.  However, for now, the pressing </p><p>concern for ECOWAS is to find the funds to maintain ECOMICI </p><p>at any troop level.  This is where a donors conference </p><p>could be instrumental and Chambas seemed to see the value </p><p>of holding such a conference sooner rather than later.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
