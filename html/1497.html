(C) OVER THE NEXT YEAR, PRESIDENT MUGABE WILL FACE </p><p>HIS GREATEST CHALLENGE IN 20 YEARS TO STAYING IN POWER. </p><p>A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IN WHICH MUGABE INTENDS TO RUN, </p><p>IS SLATED FOR EARLY 2002.  HE MUST CONTEND WITH A </p><p>SIZABLE AND RELATIVELY UNIFIED POLITICAL OPPOSITION, A </p><p>COSTLY AND UNPOPULAR INTERVENTION IN THE CONGO, </p><p>MALCONTENTS IN HIS RULING PARTY, AND HIS OWN PLUMMETING </p><p>POPULARITY ACROSS ZIMBABWE.  MUGABE IS INTRANSIGENT, </p><p>HOWEVER, AND WILL USE ALMOST ANY MEANS NECESSARY, </p><p>INCLUDING WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE, TO ENSURE HIS CONTINUED </p><p>GRIP ON THE COUNTRY.  THE PRESIDENT APPEARS WILLING TO </p><p>SACRIFICE THE ECONOMY IN ORDER TO PURSUE HIS LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM -- THE ONLY CREDIBLE PLATFORM THE </p><p>RULING PARTY HAS LEFT -- AND PUNISH HIS ENEMIES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY WHITE FARMERS.  THE PRESIDENT\'S HENCHMEN </p><p>HAVE ATTACKED AND ATTEMPTED TO UNDERMINE EVERY SEGMENT </p><p>OF SOCIETY, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY AND THE </p><p>MEDIA, THAT APPEARS OPPOSED TO HIS POLICIES.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT DOES NOT REACT WELL TO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CRITICISM, SO ANY ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE OR MODERATE HIS </p><p>THINKING SHOULD BE PUT IN TERMS OF BENEFITS TO HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00524  01 OF 07  260906Z </p><p>CONTINUED RULE AND SHOULD INVOLVE THE REGIONAL LEADERS </p><p>TO WHOM HE STILL LISTENS.  U.S. INTERESTS LIE IN </p><p>BOLSTERING THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE UNDER </p><p>SIEGE AND PREVENTING BOTH A SOCIAL EXPLOSION AND </p><p>ECONOMIC IMPLOSION THAT WOULD HAVE SERIOUS REGIONAL </p><p>IMPLICATIONS.  ZIMBABWE, WITH ITS DEMOCRATIC </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, RESILIENT MARKET ECONOMY AND INDUSTRIAL </p><p>BASE, RESPECTED JUDICIARY, AND THE BEST-EDUCATED WORK </p><p>FORCE IN AFRICA, MATTERS AND MERITS OUR TIMELY AND </p><p>CREATIVE INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THESE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>A PITCHED BATTLE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) 2001 WILL BE A CRITICAL YEAR FOR ZIMBABWE AS THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S TWO POLITICAL PARTIES SQUARE OFF TO WAGE WHAT </p><p>PROMISES TO BE A PITCHED BATTLE TO SECURE THE PRESIDENCY </p><p>IN 2002.  ALTHOUGH NOT FORMALLY CONFIRMED, ROBERT MUGABE </p><p>ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL BE THE CANDIDATE FOR THE RULING </p><p>ZANU-PF AND MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WILL HEAD UP THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) TICKET. </p><p>AT THIS WRITING THERE IS ONE TRUISM IN ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>POLITICS: ZANU-PF CANNOT WIN ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. </p><p>A HELEN SUZMAN FOUNDATION POLL RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2000 </p><p>SHOWED SUPPORT FOR MUGABE AT ITS LOWEST POST- </p><p>INDEPENDENCE EBB, PROVIDING A NATIONAL SUPPORT RATING OF </p><p>ONLY 13 PERCENT, WITH A 6 PERCENT URBAN AND 17 PERCENT </p><p>RURAL SPLIT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00524  01 OF 07  260906Z </p><p>3.  (C) THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT IS SUSPICIOUS OF AND </p><p>DOES NOT FULLY EMBRACE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO THE TRANSFER OF POWER.  HE </p><p>IS A VENGEFUL SURVIVOR, HAVING MANAGED TO GET THROUGH A </p><p>PROTRACTED LIBERATION STRUGGLE DURING THE 1960S AND </p><p>1970S, A CIVIL WAR IN THE EARLY 1980S AND TWO MAJOR </p><p>POLITICAL DEFEATS IN THE LAST YEAR. AT THE DECEMBER 2000 </p><p>ZANU-PF CONGRESS, HE NEUTRALIZED ANY OPPOSITION TO HIS </p><p>CONTINUED ROLE AS LEADER OF THE PARTY, AND THOSE </p><p>OPPONENTS WHOM HE WAS UNABLE TO CO-OPT (SUCH AS FORMER </p><p>MINISTER EDDISON ZVOBGO) WERE RELEGATED TO THE POLITICAL </p><p>WILDERNESS.  WE CREDIT THE SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT, </p><p>EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, WHO WAS PROMOTED TO THE FOURTH- </p><p>HIGHEST POST IN THE RULING PARTY AFTER MUGABE, HIS TWO </p><p>VICE PRESIDENTS (BOTH CO-EQUALS) AND PARTY CHAIRMAN JOHN </p><p>NKOMO WITH CONDUCTING THE PARTY PURGES.  IN THE OFFING </p><p>MUGABE SUCCEEDED IN CONSOLIDATING HIS BASES, PLACING </p><p>LOYAL SUPPORTERS IN KEY POSITIONS, IN ANTICIPATION OF AN </p><p>EVENTUAL TAKEOVER.  MUGABE AND MNANGAGWA\'S FATES ARE </p><p>INTERTWINED AND, FOR THE TIME BEING, THE PRESIDENT IS </p><p>ENSURED UNSWERVING SUPPORT OF HIS POLITICAL PROGRAM AND </p><p>AGENDA REGARDLESS OF ITS MERITS, VICIOUSNESS OR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO5170 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00524  02 OF 07  260906Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------BBDB66  260907Z /38 </p><p>R 260903Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8089 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 07 HARARE 000524 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/A/AID D.

MUGABE\'S CABINET IS ALSO </p><p>COMPLETELY EMASCULATED.  THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO OFFER </p><p>THOUGHTS CONTRARY TO THE PRESIDENT\'S PLANS HAVE BEEN </p><p>OVERRULED OR BANISHED.  THERE IS NO "MODERATE WING" OR </p><p>"INTELLECTUAL WING" OF ZANU-PF THAT IS IN A POSITION TO </p><p>CHECK THE PRESIDENT\'S BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) EDDISON ZVOBGO, RECENTLY DEPOSED FROM ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>POLITBURO, TOLD US JANUARY 4 THAT HE SEES NO WAY THAT </p><p>HIS PARTY CAN WIN WITH MUGABE AS ITS STANDARD BEARER IN </p><p>THE FEBRUARY OR MARCH 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p>MATABELELAND IS "IRRETRIEVABLY LOST" TO THE MDC, AND THE </p><p>HEAVILY POPULATED MAJOR URBAN AREAS, WHERE HE EXPECTS A </p><p>MASSIVE TURNOUT OF VOTERS, ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL GO TO </p><p>THE MDC AS WELL.  HE THINKS MANICALAND AND EVEN </p><p>MASVINGO, HIS OWN PROVINCE, WILL GO TO THE MDC.  AN </p><p>ELECTION HELD DURING THE RAINY SEASON IN THE RURAL AREAS </p><p>OF MASHONALAND -- ZANU-PF\'S CORE AREA OF SUPPORT -- WILL </p><p>BE MARKED BY A LOW TURNOUT, BECAUSE THE INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>WILL HAVE BEEN FLOODED OR WASHED OUT.  INTERESTINGLY, </p><p>ZVOBGO THOUGHT THAT THE LEVELS OF VIOLENCE THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO DEPLOY IN ORDER TO COW THE POPULATION INTO </p><p>VOTING OVERWHELMINGLY FOR ZANU-PF WOULD HAVE TO BE SO </p><p>GREAT AS TO BE UNACCEPTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WE HAVE BEEN PICKING UP RUMORS THAT THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS MAY BE HELD SOONER, POSSIBLY AS </p><p>EARLY AS AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER, AS A SNAP ELECTION THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00524  02 OF 07  260906Z </p><p>CATCHES THE MDC OFF GUARD INCREASES THE CHANCES OF A </p><p>ZANU-PF VICTORY.  THAT THIS MAY BE ILLEGAL UNDER THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION WILL, IN OUR OPINION, NOT DETER MUGABE FROM </p><p>SUCH AN ACT IF HE SEES THE EARLIER TIMING AS TO HIS </p><p>ADVANTAGE.  ZVOBGO ORIGINALLY SUGGESTED -- AND WAS </p><p>OVERRULED -- THAT MUGABE RESIGN AND CALL A SNAP ELECTION </p><p>IN OCTOBER TO HEAD OFF THE OBSTACLE OF LIKELY FOOD </p><p>SHORTAGES AND THROW THE OPPOSITION OFF BALANCE.  (NOTE: </p><p>MDC PARLIAMENTARIAN DAVID COLTART, WHO IS ALSO A </p><p>PROMINENT ATTORNEY, TOLD US ON JANUARY 24 THAT THE </p><p>ELECTION MUST BE HELD BETWEEN JANUARY 1 AND MARCH 31, </p><p>2002.  END NOTE).  OBSERVERS HERE PREDICT SHORTAGES OF </p><p>STAPLES SUCH AS MAIZE AND WHEAT BY YEAR\'S END.  WITH ALL </p><p>ALLOWANCES FOR MUDDLED MAOIST MINDS, IT SHOULD BE </p><p>GRANTED THAT THE MEN LEADING ZANU-PF ARE NOT FOOLS: THEY </p><p>WOULD NOT WANT MUGABE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT DURING WHAT </p><p>COULD BE THE EARLY STAGES OF A POSSIBLE FOOD SECURITY </p><p>CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE RULING PARTY\'S BRUTAL MACHINATIONS IN THE </p><p>RUN-UP TO THE BY-ELECTIONS IN BIKITA AND MARONDERA </p><p>DEMONSTRATE THAT RETAINING CONTROL BY ANY MEANS IS A </p><p>STANDING ORDER.  VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION AND BLATANT </p><p>BRIBERY AND COERCION OF THE ELECTORATE ARE OCCURRING </p><p>WITH LITTLE ATTENTION PAID TO APPEARANCES.  WRESTING THE </p><p>BIKITA SEAT AWAY FROM THE MDC WAS ALL THAT MATTERED, AND </p><p>IF THOSE IN CABINET FELT ANY REMORSE, WE SAW NO EVIDENCE </p><p>OF IT.  THIS INCREASINGLY FREQUENT SUSPENSION OF THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW IS A PARTICULARLY WORRISOME TREND AS IT </p><p>WEAKENS THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF THE NATION.  WE FEAR </p><p>THAT THIS GROWING CULTURE OF VIOLENCE IS BEGINNING TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00524  02 OF 07  260906Z </p><p>INFECT THE OPPOSITION, WHICH, UNTIL NOW, HAS MAINTAINED </p><p>THE MORAL HIGH GROUND AND BACKED AWAY FROM </p><p>CONFRONTATION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE ECONOMY SUFFERS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW MUGABE CAN </p><p>ARREST THE COUNTRY\'S WORSENING ECONOMY GIVEN HIS NON- </p><p>NEGOTIABLE POLITICAL GOALS OF GIVING LAND TO THE PEOPLE </p><p>AND STAYING IN POWER.  IN THIS AREA ZVOBGO FRANKLY </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP HAS ITS PRIORITIES </p><p>ALL WRONG, CITING THE POLITBURO\'S LOW RANKING ON ITS </p><p>PRIORITY LIST OF RENEWED TIES WITH THE MULTILATERAL </p><p>LENDERS.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT MUGABE ONCE REFERRED </p><p>TO THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AS A "MONSTER." </p><p>MUGABE APPEARS PERFECTLY WILLING TO SINK THE ECONOMY IN </p><p>ORDER TO BRING HIS LAND PROGRAM TO PASS.  IT APPEARS </p><p>THAT NO AMOUNT OF REASONING OR STRENGTH OF ARGUMENT WILL </p><p>DISSUADE HIM FROM PURSUING THE CURRENT "ACCELERATED" </p><p>LAND RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE, FROM WHICH VIRTUALLY ALL THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO5171 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00524  03 OF 07  260907Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------BBDB6E  260907Z /38 </p><p>R 260903Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8090 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 07 HARARE 000524 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/A/AID D.

THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S APPROACH HAS BEEN TO RESETTLE POOR, </p><p>UNTRAINED AND UNEQUIPPED SUBSISTENCE FARMERS ON </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS WITH A SELECTIVE REGARD FOR LEGALITIES. </p><p>EXPLORATORY EFFORTS LED BY UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR, MARK MALLOCH-BROWN, TO BRIDGE THE </p><p>GAP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION AND THAT OF THE </p><p>DONORS HAVE BORNE LITTLE FRUIT TO DATE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MUGABE HAS BEEN THE MAIN BENEFICIARY OF THE LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE, BECAUSE IT HAS GIVEN HIM THE </p><p>PRETEXT TO PUNISH HIS ENEMIES, NAMELY THE WHITE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS WHOM HE PERCEIVES AS BANKROLLING THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MDC.  LAST YEAR BEFORE THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS, HE LABELED ZIMBABWE\'S WHITES -- LESS THAN ONE </p><p>HALF PERCENT OF THE POPULATION -- AS "ENEMIES OF THE </p><p>STATE."  HIS TACTICS INCLUDE USING TARGETED, LOW- </p><p>INTENSITY VIOLENCE AGAINST THE COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTOR </p><p>IN ORDER TO FORCE THE MEMBERS OF THIS HERETOFORE </p><p>PRIVILEGED AND WEALTHY GROUP TO ABANDON THEIR ASSETS AND </p><p>NATIONALITY.  OBSERVERS HERE TELL US THAT THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS BROKE THE GENTLEMEN\'S AGREEMENT IN WHICH ZANU-PF </p><p>WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PROSPER AND FEED THE COUNTRY IN </p><p>EXCHANGE FOR THEIR STAYING OUT OF POLITICS, WHEN MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION WERE FILMED SIGNING </p><p>CHECKS FOR THE MDC\'S WAR CHEST.  NOW ANYTHING GOES, AND </p><p>MUGABE AND THE RULING PARTY WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP UP THE </p><p>PRESSURE AND DEMONIZE THE FARMERS UNTIL HIS BID FOR A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00524  03 OF 07  260907Z </p><p>RENEWED LEADERSHIP MANDATE IS SUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE FATE OF ETHNIC MINORITIES, URBAN DWELLERS </p><p>AND THE FORMAL ECONOMY DO NOT APPEAR TO BE CONCERNS OF </p><p>MUGABE\'S NUMINOUS VISION FOR THE COUNTRY.  CAPITALISTS </p><p>HAVE RESPONDED TO THIS DISREGARD, IF NOT OUTRIGHT </p><p>HOSTILITY, EITHER BY MOTHBALLING THEIR FIRMS OR </p><p>DISINVESTING OUTRIGHT.  IF THE ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY </p><p>CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE AT ITS CURRENT RAPID PACE, THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES FOR THIS COUNTRY AND THE REGION WILL BE </p><p>DEVASTATING. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>MUGABE WILL NOT BE PUSHED OFF THE SCENE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) MUGABE WILL NOT GO GENTLY INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT </p><p>OF RETIREMENT. WE SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO </p><p>CONVINCE HIM TO DO SO.  EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO SCRAPE </p><p>TOGETHER THE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO FINANCE A </p><p>GENEROUS "GOLDEN PARACHUTE" FOR HIM TO LEAVE THE SCENE, </p><p>WE DO NOT THINK MUGABE WOULD FULFILL THE TERMS OF THE </p><p>BARGAIN.  NOR, IN OUR OPINION, IN HIS TIME LEFT ON STAGE </p><p>WILL HE LISTEN TO OR HEED WELL-INTENTIONED ADVICE COMING </p><p>FROM THOSE HE DOES NOT CONSIDER ABSOLUTE BACKERS.  FOR </p><p>THOSE WITH LESS THAN WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT, THE BEST WAY </p><p>TO MAKE MUGABE LISTEN IS TO APPEAL TO HIS DESIRE TO STAY </p><p>IN POWER.  HE WILL AT LEAST CONSIDER ANY PROPOSAL THAT </p><p>IS COUCHED IN TERMS OF PROLONGING HIS POLITICAL </p><p>SURVIVAL.  TRUE TO THEIR SELF-INTEREST, THE DEFENSE </p><p>FORCES WILL CONTINUE THEIR UNWAVERING AND OBSEQUIOUS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00524  03 OF 07  260907Z </p><p>ALLEGIANCE TO MUGABE.  OFFERING STRATEGIES GROUNDED IN </p><p>MAINTAINING REGIME SECURITY, THE SENIOR MILITARY </p><p>LEADERSHIP REMAINS FOCUSED ON PERSONAL ECONOMIC </p><p>ENRICHMENT RATHER THAN A PROFESSIONAL CRITIQUE OF THE </p><p>DOMESTIC CONSEQUENCES OF FOREIGN ADVENTURISM.  APPEALS </p><p>TO HIS VANITY WILL ALSO MAKE HIM TAKE NOTICE. </p><p>MOREOVER, WE SEE INDICATION THAT MEMBERS OF MUGABE\'S </p><p>INNER CIRCLE, WHO HAVE STOLEN AND COMMITTED ATROCITIES, </p><p>ARE WORRIED THAT NOT ONLY WOULD MUGABE NOT TAKE CARE OF </p><p>THEM BUT ACTUALLY WOULD MAKE THEM THE FALL GUYS. </p><p>WILFRED MHANDA OF THE ZIMBABWE LIBERATORS PLATFORM -- A </p><p>SMALL OFFSHOOT OF THE WAR VETERANS\' ASSOCIATION THAT </p><p>OPPOSES ZANU-PF\'S POLITICIZATION OF THE EX-COMBATANTS -- </p><p>TOLD US RECENTLY THAT AIR FORCE COMMANDER PERENCE SHIRI </p><p>HAS MET TWICE WITH HIM TO EXPRESS EXACTLY THOSE FEARS. </p><p>WE ARE INCREASINGLY CONVINCED THAT PEACE IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE WITH ZANU-PF IN ITS CURRENT </p><p>ITERATION. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) HAVING NEUTRALIZED DISSENT WITHIN HIS PARTY, </p><p>MUGABE TAKES COMFORT FROM THE SUPPORT OF HIS NEIGHBORS. </p><p>ALTHOUGH PRIVATELY SOME MAY HAVE SPOKEN BLUNTLY TO THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO5174 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00524  04 OF 07  260907Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------BBDB80  260907Z /38 </p><p>R 260903Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8091 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 07 HARARE 000524 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/A/AID D.

SOUTH AFRICA, THE MOST </p><p>POWERFUL OF THESE IN THE SUB-CONTINENT AND THE ONE TO BE </p><p>MOST SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, </p><p>HAS TAKEN A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO ENGAGE MUGABE WITH </p><p>FREQUENT MINISTERIAL AND SUMMIT GATHERINGS. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT HAS BEEN </p><p>RELUCTANT TO REMONSTRATE PUBLICLY WITH OR EXACT BEHAVIOR </p><p>MODIFICATION FROM HIS ZIMBABWEAN SENIOR.  RATHER, MBEKI </p><p>HAS EXTENDED TO ZIMBABWE CREDITS FOR FUEL AND </p><p>ELECTRICITY, IN ORDER NOT TO ACCELERATE THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>ECONOMY\'S COLLAPSE AND PROVOKE A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS </p><p>THAT WOULD SPILL OVER THE LIMPOPO.  ONLY THOSE HEADS OF </p><p>STATE WHOSE COUNTRIES ARE FAR AWAY FROM HIS, SUCH AS </p><p>NIGERIA\'S OBASANJO, HAVE COME CLOSE TO EXPOSING THE </p><p>EMPEROR\'S NAKEDNESS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) IN ANY POLICY INITIATIVE TO CONTAIN SOME OF </p><p>MUGABE\'S EXCESSES WE SHOULD VIEW ZIMBABWE\'S NEIGHBORS, </p><p>SUCH AS SOUTH AFRICA, MOZAMBIQUE AND ZAMBIA, AS OUR </p><p>ALLIES.  ALTHOUGH MUGABE CARES LITTLE WHAT THE WEST </p><p>THINKS OF HIS POLICIES, HE DOES WISH TO BE SEEN AS A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC LEADER IN THE WORLD CLUB.  HE WISHES TO AVOID </p><p>THE OPPROBRIUM OF HIS FELLOW AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE, AS </p><p>HE HAS STAKED HIS CREDIBILITY WITH THEM ON THE </p><p>QUINTESSENTIALLY AFRICAN, ANTI-COLONIAL CHARACTER OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN LAND REFORM EXERCISE.  THEIR EFFORTS TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00524  04 OF 07  260907Z </p><p>ADDRESS MUGABE\'S ABUSES OF POWER, PARTICULARLY IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>(SADC), MERIT OUR STRONG BACKING, ALTHOUGH WE MUST BEAR </p><p>IN MIND THAT IN THE END THESE MAY AMOUNT TO LITTLE MORE </p><p>THAN SYMBOLIC MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE ATTEMPTED TO PROJECT STRENGTH </p><p>IN THE CONGO AT LEAST PARTIALLY IN ORDER TO THRUST </p><p>HIMSELF ONTO THE WORLD STAGE AND UPSTAGE THE MUCH- </p><p>ADULATED NELSON MANDELA -- THE THEN CHAIRMAN OF SADC -- </p><p>WHO OPPOSED THE INTERVENTION.  HIS LACK OF AN EXIT </p><p>STRATEGY, THE TOLL IN HUMAN LIVES AND TO THE NATIONAL </p><p>TREASURY OF THE CONTINUING QUAGMIRE, AND HIS LIMITED </p><p>ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR OF HIS </p><p>LATE ALLY, LAURENT KABILA, ARE FACTS THAT SUGGEST THAT </p><p>HE LAID AN EGG.  CONSEQUENTLY, IN SEEMINGLY DESPERATE </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A PALATABLE SOUFFLQ, MUGABE\'S SENIOR </p><p>MILITARY LEADERSHIP GROWS INCREASINGLY ISOLATED FROM ITS </p><p>REGIONAL COLLEAGUES.  CIVIL SOCIETY VIEWS ITS POLICE AS </p><p>ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN VOTER INTIMIDATION TACTICS AND </p><p>CIVIL DISTURBANCE BRUTALITY.  ZIMBABWE IS NOT A MILITARY </p><p>DANGER TO ITS NEIGHBORS AND DOES NOT PURSUE A WAR-LIKE </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE NEW CONGRESS MAY REVIVE </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT (ZDA) TO CONDEMN THE MUGABE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THE 2000 BILL MANDATED A "NO" VOTE BY THE </p><p>USG IN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND </p><p>RULED OUT ANY FURTHER GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE OR DEBT RELIEF, BUT OFFERED CARROTS IN THE </p><p>FORM OF MONEY FOR LAND REFORM.  WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00524  04 OF 07  260907Z </p><p>TO SINGLE OUT MUGABE FOR SANCTIONS OR ANY POLICY ACTION </p><p>THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS SUCH AND MAKE HIM A MARTYR. </p><p>MUGABE WOULD USE ENACTMENT OF THE ZDA TO DIVERT </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FROM HIMSELF AND BLAME THE USG FOR ALL OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S MISHAPS AND WOES, A ROLE THE BRITISH NOW </p><p>HAVE.  FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE TOLD AMBASSADOR MCDONALD </p><p>ON JULY 3, 2000 THAT PASSAGE OF THE ACT WOULD PUT </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY ON A WAR FOOTING, AND THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>WOULD LASH OUT AT THE U.S. ANY WAY IT COULD. ALTHOUGH WE </p><p>WOULD NOT SHRINK FROM CRITICISM, WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR </p><p>A BACKLASH AND WEIGH THE POSSIBILITY THAT MUGABE COULD </p><p>BE STRENGTHENED DOMESTICALLY BY OUR ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) OUR INTERESTS HERE LIE IN HELPING CONTAIN AND </p><p>REVERSE THE FURTHER EROSION OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, </p><p>AND AVOID A SOCIAL EXPLOSION OR HUMANITARIAN DISASTER. </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS AND OTHER CITIZENS OF THE SUB-CONTINENT LOOK </p><p>TO THE UNITED STATES, AS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT AND </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO5177 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00524  05 OF 07  260908Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------BBDB90  260908Z /38 </p><p>R 260903Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8092 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 05 OF 07 HARARE 000524 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/A/AID D.

OUR INFLUENCE IS </p><p>LIMITED TO THE USE OF SUASION WITH THIS AND OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES\' GOVERNMENTS AND IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS </p><p>DESIGNED TO MITIGATE CONFLICT AND WEAKEN THE GRIP OF </p><p>TYRANNY.  WORKING WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY, AND THE OPPOSITION WILL BE CRUCIAL TO </p><p>FULFILLING OUR GOALS.  THE RESOURCES WE APPORTION TO </p><p>THESE WILL SUBSTANTIATE OUR LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) IN OUR OPINION THE USG\'S PRINCIPAL BILATERAL </p><p>POLICY ISSUE WITH ZIMBABWE IS RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW.  WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO CONDEMN THE BREAKDOWN OF LAW </p><p>AND ORDER, THE ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY AND THE PARTISAN </p><p>USE OF THE SECURITY FORCES.  WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>STRESS THAT WE THINK THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE FOR VIOLENCE PERPETRATED DURING THE LAND </p><p>INVASIONS AND POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS BY THE MILITARY, </p><p>INTELLIGENCE AND POLICE SERVICES.  WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>MAKE THE POINT THAT THE AMNESTY ISSUED TO THOSE WHO </p><p>COMMITTED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS DURING THIS PERIOD IS, </p><p>AT A MINIMUM, MORALLY REPUGNANT TO US. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) WE SHOULD SEND AN UNEQUIVOCAL MESSAGE THAT WE </p><p>BELIEVE A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IS NEEDED FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.  WE SHOULD SIGNAL OUR EXPECTATION </p><p>OF A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION AND PUT THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00524  05 OF 07  260908Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT ON NOTICE THAT THE USG AND, INDEED THE WORLD, </p><p>WILL WATCH, DOCUMENT, AND EXPOSE AND REJECT AN UNFAIR </p><p>ELECTION.  IT MAY NOT BE TOO BOLD TO SAY THAT IF THE </p><p>NEXT PRESIDENT IS ELECTED THROUGH VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION IT WILL HAVE SERIOUS DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN IMPARTIAL IN </p><p>ASSESSING WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.  IMPARTIALITY SHOULD </p><p>NOT BE CONFUSED WITH NEUTRALITY.  WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE TO </p><p>THE OPPOSITION AS WELL THAT VIOLENCE IS NOT AN </p><p>ACCEPTABLE MEANS TO OBTAINING POWER. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>POSSIBLE STRATEGIES </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) HOW DO WE BEGIN?  WHILE WE KNOW THE NEW </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AFRICAN AFFAIRS WILL BE </p><p>EXTREMELY BUSY, WE RECOMMEND AN EARLY VISIT TO ZIMBABWE </p><p>AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES S/HE MIGHT WISH TO VISIT IN THE </p><p>REGION.  IT WOULD SIGNAL TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND </p><p>AFRICA THAT THE CONTINENT WILL BE A FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>PRIORITY AND SEND AN UNEQUIVOCAL MESSAGE THAT THE NEW </p><p>ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE TOUGH HUMAN RIGHTS AND GOOD </p><p>GOVERNANCE STANDARDS WITHOUT WHICH ALL ELSE FAILS.  THE </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WOULD DELIVER THE MESSAGE THAT WE </p><p>KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, WE ARE CONCERNED BY IT AND WE ARE </p><p>MONITORING CLOSELY THE MUGABE-MADE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS </p><p>IN THE MAKING.  SHE/HE ALSO WOULD ASK HOW MUGABE PLANS </p><p>TO REINSTATE THE RULE OF LAW WHILE AVOIDING HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00524  05 OF 07  260908Z </p><p>SOPHISTIC REASONING THAT IT REALLY DID NOT BREAK DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH WESTERN AND </p><p>FRIENDLY COUNTRIES TO EXPAND THE ISOLATION OF MUGABE AND </p><p>HIS TOP HENCHMEN.  WE SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THROUGH </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS THAT IF GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED VIOLENCE </p><p>CONTINUES, THERE WILL BE NO REFUGE FOR THESE MEN.  WE </p><p>COULD PLACE VISA AND OTHER TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON SENIOR </p><p>ZANU-PF MEMBERS TOGETHER WITH OTHER NATIONS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>THE EC.  IF WE REALLY WANT TO GO AFTER MUGABE HIMSELF WE </p><p>COULD ASCERTAIN WHERE HIS ASSETS ARE LOCATED ABROAD AND </p><p>ASK THOSE COUNTRIES TO FREEZE THEM.  THESE MEASURES </p><p>WOULD PLACE ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THE MUGABE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, HELP SHRINK ITS BASE OF SUPPORT AND SIGNAL </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY THAT THERE ARE RULES TO THE GAME, THE </p><p>FLOUTING OF WHICH RESULTS IN PENALTIES. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (C) MEASURED ENGAGEMENT WITH THE MILITARY.  WE MUST </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE COGENT IN OUR SELECTION OF TOOLS WITH </p><p>WHICH TO ENGAGE THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCES.  WHILE WE </p><p>OUGHT TO REMAIN ENGAGED IN IMET, WE MUST QUESTION THE </p><p>NEED FOR ANY INITIATIVE, WHICH OFFERS US LIMITED DEGREES </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9929 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00524  06 OF 07  260908Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------BBDB9B  260908Z /38 </p><p>R 260903Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8093 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 06 OF 07 HARARE 000524 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/A/AID D.

SHOULD WE DECIDE TO WITHDRAW INCREMENTALLY </p><p>OUR SECURITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, THE IMET AND DEMINING </p><p>PROGRAM SHOULD BE AMONG OUR FINAL ENGAGEMENT </p><p>INITIATIVES.  MOREOVER, LITTLE BENEFIT HAS RESULTED FROM </p><p>RECENT GENERAL OFFICER VISITS BY MEMBERS OF OUR ARMED </p><p>FORCES.  IN PARALLEL WITH OUR REGIONAL POLITICAL </p><p>STRATEGY, WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE CIVILIAN DEFENSE OFFICIALS </p><p>AND SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS FROM OUR CLOSEST REGIONAL </p><p>ALLIES WITHIN SADC TO PERSONALLY ADDRESS THE SECURITY </p><p>CONCERNS OF THE REGION TO ZIMBABWE\'S SENIOR CIVILIAN AND </p><p>MILITARY LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C) VIEW ZIMBABWE AS A REGIONAL ISSUE.  WE SHOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO RAISE THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS THE ISSUE </p><p>OF VIOLENCE AND GOOD GOVERNANCE WITH THE SADC </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, AND URGE THEM TO EXERT GREATER PRESSURE ON </p><p>MUGABE TO ALTER HIS RENEGADE POLICIES.  THIS DIALOGUE IN </p><p>PARTICULAR SHOULD BE GEARED TO GETTING SOUTH AFRICA OFF </p><p>THE FENCE.  WE SHOULD ENGAGE NIGERIAN PRESIDENT OBASANJO </p><p>-- ONE OF THE FEW HEADS OF STATE WITH REAL INFLUENCE ON </p><p>MUGABE -- TO PRESS MUGABE ON HONORING THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PROCESS AND THE RULE OF LAW.  MUGABE MAY ALSO RESPOND TO </p><p>PRIVATE URGINGS FROM UN SECRETARY GENERAL KOFI ANAN, A </p><p>FELLOW AFRICAN. </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C) ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS ON FIRM GROUND, THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS PROVIDES ANOTHER PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO SEEK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00524  06 OF 07  260908Z </p><p>BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION FROM MUGABE.  THE UN IS THE MOST </p><p>VISIBLE INSTITUTION IN WHICH TO CONDEMN HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>RULE OF LAW ABUSES.  WE MIGHT SUGGEST THE UN INVESTIGATE </p><p>WHO ARE THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE FAST TRACK LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROCESS, IF NECESSARY USING THE RUSE OF "SO </p><p>WE CAN ATTRACT MONEY FROM THE DONORS."  UN COMMISSIONER </p><p>FOR HUMAN RIGHTS MARY ROBINSON IS DIALOGUING WITH </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S HUMAN RIGHTS FORUM, AN INITIATIVE THAT MERITS </p><p>OUR FULL SUPPORT.  IN ADDITION, WE COULD ASK THE UN OR </p><p>THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO CONDEMN THE BREAKDOWN OF THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW AND IMPOSE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>OFFICIALS.  SIMPLY CALLING FOR A UN SESSION TO EXAMINE </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE PROBLEM WOULD EXERT SOME PRESSURE ON </p><p>MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>24.  (C) THE COMMONWEALTH HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN HOLDING </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO CERTAIN STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR.  MUGABE </p><p>RECENTLY APPOINTED FOUR JUDGES WHO, THOUGH COMPETENT </p><p>PROFESSIONALS ARE CLOSELY IDENTIFIED WITH AND PERSONALLY </p><p>OWING TO ZANU-PF.  MEMBERS OF THE BENCH WHO VALUE THEIR </p><p>PRESTIGE COME UNDER SCRUTINY BY THEIR RESPECTED </p><p>COMMONWEALTH PEERS AND WOULD NOT WANT TO RISK OPPROBRIUM </p><p>FROM THIS CLUB.  WE SHOULD SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH INVOLVEMENT IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>25.  (C) SUPPORT THE JUDICIARY.  THE CANADIAN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN </p><p>PROVIDING ASSISTANCE FOR ZIMBABWE\'S EMBATTLED JUDICIARY. </p><p>USAID\'S OFFICE OF TRANSITION INITIATIVES HAS ASSISTED IN </p><p>COURT CHALLENGES TO ELECTION RESULTS ACHIEVED THROUGH </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION.  SEEKING REMEDIES IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00524  06 OF 07  260908Z </p><p>COURTS IS ONE OF THE FEW TOOLS AVAILABLE TO CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY AND THE OPPOSITION TO HIT BACK.

ESF RESOURCES, </p><p>WHICH WE HAVE REQUESTED SEPTEL, SHOULD BE ALLOCATED FOR </p><p>THIS PURPOSE. </p><p> </p><p>26.  (C) CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM.  CIVIL SOCIETY BELIEVES </p><p>A NEW CONSTITUTION IS THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE FAIR </p><p>COMPETITIVE POLITICS, SAFEGUARD DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, </p><p>BALANCE POWER BETWEEN THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, </p><p>AND ENSURE THE PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS IN DECISION </p><p>MAKING.
