NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B),(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE HOLY SEE IS "HAPPY TO HEAR THE GOOD </p><p>NEWS" (REF) THAT PRC OFFICIALS ARE WAITING FOR A \'GESTURE\' </p><p>FROM THE VATICAN IN ORDER TO RESUME DIALOG ABOUT NORMALIZING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00215  01 OF 02  171350Z </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS.  THE HOLY SEE WILL USE </p><p>THIS OPPORTUNITY TO "TEST" WHETHER THE NEW PRC GOVERNMENT </p><p>WILL BE MORE FLEXIBLE AND WILLING TO ENGAGE THAN WAS THE </p><p>PREVIOUS LEADERSHIP.  THE HOLY SEE INTENDS TO VERIFY THE </p><p>"AVAILABILITY" OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT BY APPROACHING THE PRC </p><p>EMBASSY TO ITALY.  MFA DIRECTOR FOR CHINA AFFAIRS, MSGR. </p><p>ROTA-GRAZIOSI, TOLD POLOFF THAT THE HOLY SEE IS READY TO FIND </p><p>SOLUTIONS TO THE THREE MAIN OBSTACLES BLOCKING NORMALIZATION </p><p>OF RELATIONS, BUT THAT THE PRC MUST ENGAGE IN DIALOG IN ORDER </p><p>TO REACH AN AGREEMENT.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI IDENTIFIED THE THREE </p><p>OBSTACLES AS AUTONOMY OF THE CHURCH IN CHINA, DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND TAIWAN, AND PRC ACCEPTANCE </p><p>OF THE POPE\'S RECOGNITION OF PAST MISTAKES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>CHURCH AUTONOMY AND NORMALIZATION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ASSESSING THE OBSTACLES TO NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND CHINA, HOLY SEE MFA CHINA DIRECTOR </p><p>MSGR. ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CHINA </p><p>"MUST BE AUTONOMOUS, BUT COULD NOT BE INDEPENDENT" FROM THE </p><p>HOLY SEE.  HE GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE </p><p>U.S., WHICH WAS SELF-GOVERNING BUT ACCEPTED GUIDANCE AND </p><p>INTERVENTION FROM THE POPE.  HE SEES THE CHURCH EVENTUALLY </p><p>FUNCTIONING ROUGHLY IN THE SAME MANNER IN CHINA, EXCEPT WITH </p><p>THE ADDITIONAL LAYER OF GOVERNMENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF ORDINATIONS AND OTHER PAPAL DECISIONS. </p><p> HE POINTED OUT THAT GOVERNMENTS IN EUROPE AND VIETNAM ARE </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE ORDINATION PROCESS, WHICH THE CHURCH ACCEPTS </p><p>-- UP TO A POINT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00215  01 OF 02  171350Z </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>RECONCILING THE TWO CHURCHES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THAT RECONCILING THE </p><p>UNDERGROUND AND OFFICIAL BISHOPS IN CHINA WILL BE A </p><p>"DELICATE" AND "IMPORTANT" MATTER.  THE HOLY SEE IS PREPARED </p><p>TO REVIEW WITH THE PRC THE STATUS OF EACH BISHOP, WHETHER </p><p>FROM THE UNDERGROUND OR OFFICIAL CHURCH, ON A CASE BY CASE </p><p>BASIS.  THE HOLY SEE POSITION IS THAT ALL BISHOPS AND PRIESTS </p><p>IN CHINA ARE VALID AND MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH (AND CAN </p><p>ADMINISTER THE SACRAMENTS) BUT ONLY THOSE ORDAINED BY THE </p><p>POPE ARE LEGITIMATE CATHOLIC PRIESTS.  THE HOLY SEE IS AWARE </p><p>OF THE PRC\'S CONCERN ABOUT THE ROLE BEIJING BISHOP FU TIESHAN </p><p>WILL PLAY IN THE FUTURE CHURCH.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THAT </p><p>BISHOP FU WAS A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH, HOWEVER, THE IDEA THAT </p><p>BISHOP FU WOULD BE PROMOTED TO A CARDINAL TO FACILITATE </p><p>NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WAS "NONSENSE."  "THE APPOINTMENT </p><p>OF CARDINALS IS A PERSONAL CHOICE OF THE POPE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THAT IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE IS "WILLING TO CUT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN" </p><p>AND ESTABLISH THEM WITH BEIJING.  EVEN THOUGH THIS ACTION </p><p>WOULD BE "HUMILIATING" TO TAIWAN, THE HOLY SEE IS "PREPARED </p><p>TO PAY THAT PRICE" IN ORDER TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>PRC.  HE SAID THAT "WHILE THE HOLY FATHER HAS TO THINK OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00215  01 OF 02  171350Z </p><p>300,000 CATHOLICS IN TAIWAN HE MUST ALSO CONSIDER THE 10 </p><p>MILLION CATHOLICS IN MAINLAND CHINA AND HIS PASTORAL DUTIES </p><p>TO THEM".  WHEN ASKED IF THE HOLY SEE WOULD ALLOW SOME TIME </p><p>TO PASS BETWEEN CUTTING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN AND </p><p>ESTABLISHING THEM WITH THE PRC, ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THAT WAS A </p><p>TOPIC THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH DIALOG.  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE IS NOT WILLING TO CUT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AS A STEP </p><p>TOWARD NORMALIZED RELATIONS BUT RATHER AS PART OF A PACKAGE </p><p>OF "CONCESSIONS WHICH MUST BE MADE" THAT WILL GUARANTEE </p><p>NORMALIZED RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>PAPAL APOLOGY NOT IN THE CARDS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0596 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00215  02 OF 02  171350Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AIT-03   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  SS-00    DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------2752DB  171351Z /38 </p><p>R 171322Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>AMCONSUL GUANGZHOU </p><p>AMCONSUL HONG KONG </p><p>AMCONSUL SHANGHAI </p><p>AMCONSUL SHENYANG </p><p>AIT TAIPEI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 000215 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

(C)  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THAT THE POPE WOULD NEVER </p><p>SPECIFICALLY APOLOGIZE FOR THE OCTOBER 2000 CANONIZATION OF </p><p>CHINESE MARTYRS.  HE BELIEVES THAT THE PRC USES THIS AS AN </p><p>EXCUSE TO PREVENT PROGRESS.  HE SAID THAT THIS WAS ANOTHER </p><p>ISSUE THAT COULD BE SETTLED WITH DIALOG. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00215  02 OF 02  171350Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  ROTA-GRAZIOSI HAS ALWAYS BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE </p><p>PRC\'S WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE THE HOLY SEE IN DIRECT DIALOG AND </p><p>MAKE CHANGES WITHIN CHINA OUTSIDE OF THE ECONOMIC ARENA.  HE </p><p>WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR FROM US PER REF EMAIL THAT THE PRC WAS </p><p>WAITING FOR A "GESTURE" FROM THE HOLY SEE.  HE SAID THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE WOULD "VERIFY THE AVAILABILITY" OF THE PRC EMBASSY </p><p>TO ITALY AND ADVISE EMBASSY OF THE RESULTS. THE POPE BELIEVES </p><p>HIS APOLOGY IN OCTOBER 2001 FOR THE EXCESSES OF THE CHURCH IN </p><p>CHINA HAS LARGELY ADDRESSED CHINESE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PAST. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA00215 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
