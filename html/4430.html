<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 002163 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR THE DEPUTY SECRETARY AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY ROCCA FROM </p><p>AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, PGOV, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: WHAT THE PM WILL RAISE WITH YOU IN OSLO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR E. ASHLEY WILLS.  REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) I saw PM Wickremesinghe three times this week, twice </p><p>at social events and most recently today together with Deputy </p><p>USTR Huntsman, who is here for the first official meeting on </p><p>trade issues since the TIFA was signed in July.  (Ambassador </p><p>Huntsman\'s visit, by the way, is going extremely well, as we </p><p>will report by septel.)  On all three occasions, Ranil and I </p><p>had brief exchanges about what he intends to raise with you </p><p>in Oslo. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Aggregating his responses, it seems he wants to thank </p><p>you for your personal involvement in and support of his </p><p>government\'s attempt to end the civil conflict through </p><p>negotiations.  It means a lot to him, he said, that you will </p><p>be attending the Oslo meeting.  He added that he would </p><p>mention his appreciation of the various USG-sponsored </p><p>assessments that have been carried out in recent months, in </p><p>particular those involving the Peace Corps, USAID and </p><p>Treasury programs and the three teams from DOD.  In the </p><p>latter connection, he said that peace is the target but his </p><p>military\'s preparedness is a key factor in the equation as </p><p>well.  "We don\'t want to return to fighting, that\'s for sure, </p><p>but the LTTE must perceive that our military is not weak." </p><p>He elaborated that this is why US assistance to Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>military forces, mainly in the form of training, education </p><p>and other mil-mil contacts, is so important.  He also </p><p>expressed his hope that "modest" equipment sales -- mainly </p><p>relating to maritime surveillance and interdiction -- would </p><p>be forthcoming too. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) I replied that his agenda sounded fine to me, but </p><p>added that I hoped he would not put too much emphasis on </p><p>equipment sales.  These might or might not be possible, I </p><p>said, but it is clear that we see our greatest value added in </p><p>the military field in mil-mil engagement programs relating to </p><p>training and education.  Bottom line:  he probably will raise </p><p>equipment sales with you but not forcefully, as it were. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ranil\'s mood is very positive as he approaches Oslo. </p><p>He and his Cabinet colleagues have got our message that they </p><p>should not have high expectation about the money likely to be </p><p>pledged.  The important thing, we and other donors here </p><p>stressed, is our political support of the process.  (Indeed, </p><p>GL Peiris told the media 11/19 that the GSL never expected </p><p>many new financial pledges at Oslo and that it now refers to </p><p>the event not as a donors\' conference but as a "peace </p><p>support" one.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c) The GSL seems to be coming to the view that the LTTE </p><p>means it this time.  Various ministers I have spoken with </p><p>lately have been somewhat less dubious about the Tigers\' </p><p>intentions.  (GL Peiris is utterly convinced that the LTTE is </p><p>for real, an enthusiasm that is not shared by his Cabinet </p><p>colleagues, and that I too find unwarranted.)  But they all </p><p>stress how important it is for us and others in the </p><p>international community to remain steadfast in reminding the </p><p>LTTE that its behavior is being closely observed and that it </p><p>has yet to be declarative in renouncing violence and the idea </p><p>of Tamil Eelam and in embracing the idea of genuine </p><p>democracy. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In one of our brief exchanges this week, I asked </p><p>Ranil what he thought of the PA\'s harsh statement last week </p><p>alleging bias on the part of the Norwegians and softness on </p><p>the part of the US and the UK regarding the LTTE.  He replied </p><p>that it showed just how unhappy President Kumaratunga is </p><p>about the positive trend of events.  He did not reckon that </p><p>the statement would have a major impact or that it meant that </p><p>the PA could not be worked with.  In this regard, he said he </p><p>will brief the President privately when he returns from Oslo. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
