CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING A RECENT LENGTHY TALK WITH CHARGE, A </p><p>LEADING THAI BUSINESSMAN WITH OVER 100 FISHING BOATS </p><p>PLYING BURMESE WATERS PROVIDED CHAPTER AND VERSE ON </p><p>CORRUPTION AMONG RANGOON\'S RULING GENERALS.  ADMITTING </p><p>THAT HE PERSONALLY MULES IN ABOUT 50,000 DOLLARS IN </p><p>CASH DURING WEEKLY TRIPS TO BURMA, THE ENTREPRENEUR </p><p>SAID THAT PERHAPS 15 PERCENT OF THIS MONEY WAS </p><p>EARMARKED FOR PAYOFFS TO SENIOR GENERALS.  (THE </p><p>REMAINDER GOES TO THE GOB FOR FISHING RIGHTS.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  DILATING ON WHO GETS WHAT, THE THAI BUSINESSMAN </p><p>NOTED THAT FORMER MINISTER FOR FISHERIES LIEUTENANT </p><p>GENERAL CHIT SWE HAD LONG BEEN THE "PRIME RECIPIENT". </p><p>"TAUGHT BY THE THAI", HE SAID, "THE MINISTER HAS AN </p><p>EXQUISITE SENSE AS TO HOW TO RECEIVE A BRIBE AND YET </p><p>PRESERVE SOME DEGREE OF DENIABILITY."  ACCORDINGLY, </p><p>CHIT SWE DECLINES ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS WITH THAI </p><p>BUSINESSMEN, INSISTING THAT ALL DISCREET DEALINGS BE </p><p>WITH HIS SON WHO ALSO ESCORTS DEPARTING ENTREPRENEURS </p><p>THROUGH CUSTOMS WITHOUT THE USUAL CHECKS AS PART OF </p><p>THE FAMILY\'S SERVICES.  COMMENT:  MOST RECENTLY, CHIT </p><p>SWE\'S SON CAME TO THE AIRPORT ON 20 MINUTES NOTICE TO </p><p>SQUIRE A GROUP OF SOME 60 THAI ENTREPRENEURS THROUGH </p><p>CUSTOMS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AS FOR OTHER DEALINGS WITH MEMBERS OF THE RULING </p><p>STATE LAW AND ORDER RESTORATION COUNCIL (SLORC), THE </p><p>BUSINESSMAN OBSERVED THAT ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF TIN 00 </p><p>WAS ALSO A RECIPIENT OF DIVERSE GRATUITIES.  HOWEVER, </p><p>MAJOR GENERAL TIN 00 HAD A REPUTATION FOR </p><p>"RENEGOTIATING DEALS AND OTHERWISE BEING DIFFICULT". </p><p>MOREOVER, EVER SINCE HIS TEENAGE SON HAD RECEIVED A </p><p>MERCEDES BENZ FOR BROKERING ONE DEAL AND TAKEN TO </p><p>DRIVING IT AROUND TOWN, TIN 00 HAS BEEN UNDER CLOSE </p><p>SCRUTINY BY THE BURMESE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE (DDSI) </p><p>WHOSE AGENTS CONDUCT SPOT CHECKS ON HIS RESIDENCE. </p><p>COMMENT:  ACCORDING TO THIS BUSINESSMAN AND ANOTHER </p><p>SOURCE, INTELLIGENCE CHIEF KHIN NYUNT FORCED TIN 00 TO </p><p>TURN THE MERCEDES BENZ OVER TO THE GOB. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WHILE HIS OWN BUSINESS DEALINGS DO NOT INVOLVE ANY </p><p>OF THE JUNTA\'S TRUE HEAVYWEIGHTS, THE THAI </p><p>ENTREPRENEUR NOTED THAT SEVERAL OF HIS PEERS HAVE HAD </p><p>DEALINGS WITH KHIN NYUNT\'S WIFE -- WHO HAS A FONDNESS </p><p>FOR EXPENSIVE JEWELRY -- AND WITH THE SON OF NEW HEAD </p><p>OF STATE THAN SHWE.  IN BOTH INSTANCES, GRATUITIES </p><p>HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN LIMITED TO COMPARATIVELY MODEST </p><p>GIFTS AS A REWARD FOR INFLUENCE PEDDLING.  DESPITE </p><p>THAN SHWE\'S APRIL 23 PROMOTION, THE BUSINESSMAN </p><p>DOUBTED THAT BURMA\'S NEW LEADER WOULD "ENRICH HIMSELF </p><p>UNDULY ON THE JOB" OR "ALLOW CORRUPTION BY OTHER </p><p>GENERALS TO INCREASE".  IN THIS REGARD, THE </p><p>BUSINESSMAN OBSERVED THAT GENERAL THAN SHWE LIVED </p><p>AUSTERELY EVEN BY BURMESE STANDARDS AND HAD LITTLE USE </p><p>FOR SUCH WESTERN LUXURIES AS AIR CONDITIONING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HUDDLE </p><p></p></div>
