<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 001921 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF/E MORIARTY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MA, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN CLUELESS ON MADAGASCAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: MORIARTY/FROWICK TELCON 04/12 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON, REASON E.O. 12958 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  PER REFTELCON, POLOFF MET MORNING OF MONDAY, APRIL 15 </p><p>WITH VATICAN DESK OFFICER FOR MADAGASCAR AFFAIRS MONS. LUIGI </p><p>CAVALIERE.  (NOTE: CAVALIERE, AN "OLD SCHOOL" VATICAN </p><p>DIPLOMAT WHO ALSO COVERS AUSTRIA, FRANCE, NETHERLANDS, </p><p>SWITZERLAND AND SEVERAL OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES, HAD -- LIKE </p><p>POLOFF -- TO READ UP ON THE SITUATION IN MADAGASCAR BEFORE </p><p>THE MEETING. END NOTE.)  CAVALIERE HAD NOTHING MUCH TO OFFER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01921  180557Z </p><p>BY WAY OF INSIGHT ON A WAY OUT OF THE DETERIORATING SITUATION </p><p>IN MADAGASCAR.  CAVALIERE SAID THE SITUATION WAS DELICATE, </p><p>BUT VAGUE AND FLUID, AND HADN\'T MUCH MORE TO ADD.  IN FACT, </p><p>TO UNDERSCORE THE HOLY SEE\'S LACK OF FOCUS ON MADAGASCAR, HE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED IT AS A "CIOCCOLATINO" (CHOCOLATE TIDBIT) </p><p>COMPARED TO THE HOLY SEE\'S WORRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p>INDEED, HE LIMITED HIMSELF TO RESTATING THE POPE\'S LAST </p><p>PRONOUNCEMENT ON MADAGASCAR, READ AT THE MARCH 3 ANGELUS </p><p>PRAYER, IN WHICH THE PONTIFF CALLED FOR PEACE, JUSTICE AND </p><p>DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  NOTING THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD IN OTHER AFRICAN </p><p>CONFLICT AREAS BEEN ABLE TO EMPLOY A SPECIAL DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>INVOLVED PARTIES (E.G. THE JESUIT CONTACTS WITH MUGABE), </p><p>POLOFF ASKED WHETHER THE CAVALIERE KNEW OF ANY PERSONAL </p><p>CONTACTS CHURCH OFFICIALS MIGHT HAVE WITH RATSIRANGA.  HE </p><p>KNEW OF NONE, BUT AVERRED THAT THE NUNCIO (WHO HAD JUST </p><p>RETURNED TO ANTANANARIVO FROM A FAMILY VISIT IN ITALY) WOULD </p><p>BE IN THE BEST POSITION TO TALK TO BOTH PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  COMMENT:  OBVIOUSLY CAVALIERE WAS NOT SO CONCERNED AT </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN MADAGASCAR ACTUALLY TO BE FOLLOWING THEM.  HE </p><p>TOLD US HE HAD RELIED MOSTLY ON FRENCH DAILY LE MONDE </p><p>REPORTS.  INDEED, HE SEEMED TO BE LIVING UP TO HIS NAME -- </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE HE POOH-POOHED THE USG DECISION TO MOVE TO </p><p>ORDERED DEPARTURE.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE HIS CAVALIER ATTITUDE </p><p>WOULD REFLECT THE CONCERNS OF HIS SUPERIORS. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA01921 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
