<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000476 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH AK PARTY LEADER ERDOGAN: </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT GOT ECONOMIC POLICY AND REFORMS </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Noting loss of market confidence, Ambassador </p><p>pressed AK party chairman Erdogan to use his influence </p><p>clearly to affirm that the GOT will hew to its IMF-supported </p><p>economic program.  Erdogan professed that there are no </p><p>differences between the GOT and IMF on goals; he averred that </p><p>the social support measures the GOT must take are not in </p><p>conflict with GOT intentions to stay on the program.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Calling on Erdogan Jan. 19 to discuss several </p><p>subjects, Ambassador recalled how Erdogan had projected </p><p>dynamism and hope during the fall 2002 general election </p><p>campaign.  Erdogan had also laid out his vision of Turkey as </p><p>a prosperous, democratic, Muslim model for President Bush at </p><p>the White House Dec. 10.  However, initial enthusiastic </p><p>market reaction to Erdogan\'s approach has waned in the face </p><p>of uncertainty about the AK government\'s performance and </p><p>intentions.  The U.S. now hopes Erdogan will take advantage </p><p>of his considerable credibility among the voters to deliver a </p><p>clearer and more concrete affirmation of AK\'s adherence to </p><p>its IMF-backed economic program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador suggested that the AK government could take </p><p>better advantage of two World Bank-financed social services </p><p>and agricultural support programs.  One program would finance </p><p>subsidies for fuel bills and textbook expenses for poorer </p><p>strata.  In the other case, the World Bank could help </p><p>expedite direct support payments to farmers which are now </p><p>being seriously delayed.  Use of World Bank facilities would </p><p>avoid the negative impact on the primary surplus from any GOT </p><p>use of budgetary resources to fix these problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador added that the USG is reviewing the whole </p><p>range of possible steps the U.S. could take to broaden trade </p><p>relations in a way useful to the AK government.  Summing up, </p><p>Ambassador reiterated the role Erdogan could play to help </p><p>convince markets that the GOT remains committed to its </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In response Erdogan asserted that there are no </p><p>problems between the GOT and IMF on basic principles and </p><p>goals.  Indeed, growth was up significantly in 2002.  But the </p><p>GOT cannot ignore the stark poverty among a significant </p><p>proportion of Turkish society and has to take steps to meet </p><p>social needs.  In any event, the steps to reduce poverty are </p><p>not in contradiction with the IMF program, he averred. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
