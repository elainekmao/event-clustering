Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In a rare formal public statement, the </p><p>Tamil Tigers have criticized the U.S. over not being </p><p>invited to the upcoming Washington Seminar on Sri Lanka. </p><p>Mission is also picking up some low-key bad vibes from </p><p>the group\'s supporters in Sri Lanka over the matter. </p><p>Overall, our guess is that the Tigers -- who know very </p><p>well they are on our FTO list -- will get over their </p><p>disappointment at not being invited in short order.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Tigers Hit Out at U.S. </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>have criticized the U.S. over not being invited to the </p><p>State Department-sponsored Washington Seminar on Sri </p><p>Lanka.  (Note:  The April 14 seminar will bring together </p><p>over 30 countries and many international organizations </p><p>to discuss Sri Lanka\'s peace process, and reconstruction </p><p>and development needs.  It is part of the leadup to the </p><p>Tokyo donors conference in June.  End Note.)  The LTTE\'s </p><p>comments were made in a formal public statement issued </p><p>late April 4.  (Note:  Key sections of the statement are </p><p>contained in Para 8.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In its specifics, the LTTE\'s statement said </p><p>the group was "disappointed by its exclusion" from the </p><p>conference.  The statement claimed that the government </p><p>and the LTTE had agreed to an "equal and joint </p><p>partnership" regarding efforts to solicit international </p><p>assistance.  By not inviting the Tigers to the seminar, </p><p>"the United States (had) undermined this joint effort by </p><p>isolating the LTTE and solely promoting the GSL at the </p><p>preliminary meeting on April 14...(The U.S. decision) </p><p>also undermines confidence in both the reconstruction </p><p>initiative and the peace process."  The statement closed </p><p>by urging donors to endorse "joint participation" by the </p><p>GSL and the LTTE in reconstruction and development </p><p>efforts in the future. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>A Rare Formal Public Statement </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The way the statement was issued indicated the </p><p>high precedence that the LTTE gave the matter.  Tiger </p><p>views are often carried by pro-LTTE web-sites and </p><p>newspapers.  The April 4 statement, however, was issued </p><p>as an "urgent press release" direct from the LTTE\'s </p><p>civilian offices in Kilinochchi in Tiger-controlled </p><p>northern Sri Lanka.  It is very rare for the usually </p><p>secretive group to issue a formal press statement, which </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>is something it does only on matters it considers highly </p><p>important.  (Note:  In the past, for example, the group </p><p>has issued formal statements on such major issues as its </p><p>agreement to enter into face-to-face talks with the GSL </p><p>late last year and its agreement to the terms of the </p><p>February 2002 ceasefire accord.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Bad Vibrations from LTTE Supporters </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In the days before the issuance of the </p><p>statement, Mission had been picking up bad vibrations </p><p>from LTTE supporters toward the U.S.  Last week, for </p><p>example, a pro-LTTE contact in Jaffna recommended that a </p><p>Mission poloff not visit Jaffna at this time because the </p><p>situation was "tense" there.  Asked to explain, the </p><p>contact asserted that Tamils were not happy with U.S. </p><p>policy over Iraq and were planning a demonstration on </p><p>April 4.  As reported in Mission updates re local </p><p>reaction to Operation Iraqi Freedom (see Septels), </p><p>Mission had picked up absolutely no signs of dissonance </p><p>from Tamils re U.S. actions in the Gulf up to the point </p><p>when this comment was made.  Mission later heard that </p><p>the LTTE, angry over not being invited to the Washington </p><p>seminar, was indeed the sponsor of the April 4 anti-war </p><p>rally in Jaffna city.  (Note:  In any event, the rally </p><p>was peaceful and quite small, with only about 40 people </p><p>in attendance.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) (((Note:  Poloff asked M. Senethirajah, a senior </p><p>Tamil National Alliance, "TNA," MP, about the press </p><p>statement.  Senethirajah, who is very pro-LTTE, </p><p>responded that he had no comment at this time.  He noted </p><p>that TNA MPs were due to meet with LTTE leaders in </p><p>Kilinochchi on April 10 in one of their periodic </p><p>meetings.  He said this meeting should provide more </p><p>clarity re LTTE views on this matter.))) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Despite their evident disappointment, our guess </p><p>is that the Tigers will get over this matter in short </p><p>order.  We doubt the group wants to pick a fight with </p><p>the U.S.  The Tigers know very well that they are on our </p><p>Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) list and had no </p><p>chance of being invited to the U.S. to attend the </p><p>April 14 meeting.  (Note:  In the days preceding the </p><p>Tiger statement, Mission had been underscoring this </p><p>point re the FTO with news organizations when asked </p><p>about the USG position.  Department made the same point </p><p>in its press guidance contained in Ref A.)  Indeed, the </p><p>tone of their statement was more one of sorrow than of </p><p>anger.  In issuing the press statement, the LTTE was </p><p>probably making a public show of disappointment for the </p><p>sake of its Tamil supporters.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>LTTE Statement </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Key sections of the LTTE\'s press statement </p><p>follow: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Urgent Press Release </p><p>LTTE Headquarters </p><p>Kilinochchi </p><p>April 4, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>LTTE\'s Exclusion from Donor Conference Undermines Peace </p><p>Process </p><p> </p><p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is </p><p>disappointed by its exclusion from the international </p><p>conference to support reconstruction and rehabilitation </p><p>efforts in the north and east of Sri Lanka to be hosted </p><p>by the United States in Washington on April 14. </p><p> </p><p>From the outset of the Norwegian-brokered negotiations, </p><p>the two parties to the conflict, the LTTE and the </p><p>Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL), agreed to equal and </p><p>joint partnership in efforts to solicit international </p><p>financial assistance for reconstruction and </p><p>rehabilitation efforts in the north and east of Sri </p><p>Lanka.  We point out that Sub-Committee on Immediate </p><p>Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs was formed in the </p><p>context of this equal and joint partnership.  It was </p><p>also in this context that the first international donor </p><p>conference held in Oslo on November 25, 2002 was </p><p>successfully staged.  Whilst funds were pledged for </p><p>urgent needs at that meeting, a larger donor conference </p><p>to be held in June this year in Japan was promoted as </p><p>the main forum for securing international assistance for </p><p>reconstruction efforts in the war-torn Tamil areas. </p><p> </p><p>Regrettably, the United States has undermined this joint </p><p>effort by isolating the LTTE and solely promoting the </p><p>GoSL at the preliminary meeting on April 14.  The </p><p>exclusion of the LTTE from reconstruction efforts in the </p><p>Tamil areas of Sri Lanka is against the spirit of the </p><p>peace process.  It also undermines confidence in both </p><p>the reconstruction initiative and the peace process. </p><p>The LTTE is therefore dismayed and disappointed by the </p><p>US action. </p><p> </p><p>We call upon the United States and international donors </p><p>to actively support the Norwegian peace process by </p><p>endorsing the joint participation of the LTTE and GoSL </p><p>in reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in the </p><p>north and east of Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>9.
