<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 002876 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NP FOR KCROUCH, LONDON AND ROME FOR CUSTOMS </p><p>ATTACHES, DOC/BIS FOR RCUPPITT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/15/08 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PARM, PREL, PTER, KSTC, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: EXBS TEAM RECEIVES COMMITMENT FROM UAEG FOR TRAINING </p><p>STARTING IN OCTOBER </p><p> </p><p>REFS: ABU DHABI 6417 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Acting DCM Thomas E. Williams for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment:  An interagency USG visited </p><p>the UAE June 14-15 to successfully re-launch a comprehensive, </p><p>multidisciplinary training roadmap on the </p><p>key bilateral issue of export controls and border security (EXBS). </p><p>The team met with a number of UAE officials with EXBS </p><p>responsibilities, receiving a warm welcome from federal officials </p><p>in Abu Dhabi, and assurances from the UAE\'s coordinating body </p><p>for export controls that the first of our proposed courses </p><p>here would begin by October 2003.  The UAEG is strongly </p><p>committed to establishing a first-class export controls regime, </p><p>and this visit was a good opportunity to convey our bilateral </p><p>export control objectives to working-level UAE officials, and </p><p>to ensure the buy-in of key officials in the Ministry of </p><p>Interior -- the newly-designated coordinator at the federal </p><p>level for EXBS activities.  We will coordinate with the </p><p>federal authorities to ensure robust UAE participation at the </p><p>Global Transshipment Control Enforcement Seminar in Sydney </p><p>next month, and prepare for the first WMD Commodity </p><p>Identification and Customs Assessment visit tentatively </p><p>scheduled for later this year. </p><p>End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>The UAEG Reaffirms Its Commitment... </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Receiving the team 6/14, UAE Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs Assistant Undersecretary for Political Affairs </p><p>Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuami restated the UAE\'s political commitment </p><p>to the export controls roadmap, and expressed his hope that </p><p>intensive training could begin in the UAE later this year. </p><p>As reported reftel, Al- Nuami noted that responsibility on the </p><p>UAE side for coordinating our entire range of </p><p>bilateral export control initiatives had been transferred </p><p>to the Ministry of Interior, which is responsible in part for </p><p>the UAE\'s border security. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Al-Nuami noted, however, that the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs is coordinating the UAE\'s participation in </p><p>the Global Transshipment Control Enforcement Seminar in Sydney, </p><p>July 14-18, and undertook to pass the delegates\' names and </p><p>contact information to the Embassy as soon as possible.  A/DCM </p><p>emphasized that the UAE delegation would be expected to give a </p><p>presentation on the UAE export control regime and related </p><p>processes, and encouraged the MFA to send a senior official to </p><p>lead the UAE\'s bilateral meeting with U.S. officials scheduled </p><p>for July 14. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>...And Begins To Take Concrete Steps </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The EXBS team met with UAE Ministry of Interior Assistant </p><p>Undersecretary of Security Affairs Major General Saif </p><p>Abdallah Al-Shafar and a large contingent of his staff </p><p>responsible for export controls issues -- some of whom will </p><p>travel to Sydney in July.  Our interlocutors were prepared for the </p><p>meeting, and had translated the EXBS roadmap into Arabic for </p><p>further dissemination to other ministries and </p><p>departments in the UAEG. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) General Shafar emphasized that the training modules </p><p>should be clear and easy to implement from the start, and </p><p>added that it may be necessary for the EXBS trainers to offer </p><p>the same course again and again to reach a wide audience.  He was </p><p>pleased with the comprehensive approach to the EXBS training, </p><p>however, and suggested that the first course on WMD Commodity </p><p>Identification and Customs Assessment begin in October. </p><p>General Shafar assured the EXBS team that UAE participation in the </p><p>courses would be inter-ministerial, and involve both federal and </p><p>emirate-level officials from across the country. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Other Ministries Interested In Training </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) GHQ Major Khalid Hareb Saeed Al-Mazrouie also undertook </p><p>to send a delegate to the Sydney Conference during his meeting </p><p>with the EXBS team later in the day. GHQ already works closely </p><p>with the Ministry of Health on controlling narcotics </p><p>trafficking and the transport of chemical and biological </p><p>agents through the UAE, and thinks that the weapons identification </p><p>training offered through the EXBS program </p><p>could have other applications here, as well. </p><p>8.  (C) Ministry of Health Director of the Drug Control </p><p>Department Dr. Easa Al- Mansouri provided the EXBS team with </p><p>an update on MoH efforts to register companies </p><p>and private institutions that import or export chemical </p><p>precursors -- in line with the UAE\'s commitments as a signatory </p><p>to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Dr. Easa </p><p>noted that the UAE already maintains an export controls list -- </p><p>the list is approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- but </p><p>admitted that it was very limited, with only 33 chemical agents </p><p>listed. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The EXBS team did not have the opportunity to clear </p><p>this cable. Dubai meetings reported septel. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
