<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HAVANA 005167 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PREF, PGOV, CU </p><p>SUBJECT:  BEHIND CASTRO\'S THREATS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HAVANA 5150 </p><p> </p><p>1.   CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.   WHY THE CHANGE IN GOC ATTITUDE TOWARD MASSIVE </p><p>EMIGRATION?  FOR YEARS NOW, MOST OBSERVERS HAD JUDGED </p><p>THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT AS UNLIKELY TO STAGE ANOTHER MARIEL </p><p>OR TO OPEN ITS SHORES TO FREE EMIGRATION FOR FEAR OF </p><p>UNLEASHING A SITUATION WHICH IT COULD NOT CONTROL.  WHAT </p><p>HAPPENED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO CHANGE THIS </p><p>SITUATION WAS THAT CUBAN AUTHORITIES WERE GRADUALLY </p><p>LOSING CONTROL, EVEN WHILE SEEKING TO PREVENT ILLEGAL </p><p>EMIGRATION.  THE RATE OF ILLEGAL DEPARTURES BY REFUGEES </p><p>TAKING CUBAN GOVERNMENT BOATS HAS INCREASED </p><p>GEOMETRICALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE SITUATION WAS DRAMATICALLY AGGRAVATED BY THE </p><p>DROWNINGS OF OVER THIRTY FLEEING CUBANS ON JULY 13 IN </p><p>THE TUGBOAT SUNK BY THE ACTIONS OF OTHER TUGBOATS.  THE </p><p>NEGATIVE INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION AND DOMESTIC DISCONTENT </p><p>WHICH THIS INCIDENT PRODUCED ADDED GREATLY TO GOVERNMENT </p><p>PRESSURES BY MAKING VIOLENT EFFORTS TO DETER BOAT THEFTS </p><p>UNPALATABLE.  THE APPARENT USE OF WEAPONS TO SEIZE </p><p>HIGHLY VISIBLE HAVANA HARBOR FERRIES WAS A MAJOR </p><p>IRRITANT AND THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT BECAME CONVINCED THAT </p><p>THE USG WOULD NOT ACT SERIOUSLY TO PUNISH ANY </p><p>PERPETRATORS.  THE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC ANXIOUSNESS TO FLEE </p><p>THE ISLAND PRODUCED BY THESE FERRY FLIGHTS LED ON AUGUST </p><p>5 TO HUGE CROWDS WHICH SOON TURNED FROM THOUGHTS OF </p><p>FLIGHT TO ANTIGOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS AND LOOTING. </p><p> </p><p>4.   THE GOVERNMENT THUS WAS INCREASINGLY FACING A </p><p>SITUATION IN WHICH IT FEARED LOSING CONTROL, EVEN AS IT </p><p>SOUGHT TO PREVENT EMIGRATION.  IT IS IN THIS LIGHT THAT </p><p>FIDEL CASTRO\'S DECISION TO THREATEN TO UNLEASH MASSIVE </p><p>REFUGEE FLIGHT UPON THE U.S. CAN BE UNDERSTOOD.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT SUCH A DECISION COULD STIMULATE DEPARTURE </p><p>EFFORTS BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, EVEN THOUGH PRIVATELY </p><p>HELD VESSELS ARE RARE.  CUBA WOULD INDEED BE TAKING A </p><p>SERIOUS RISK IN OPENING ITS BORDERS -- PROBABLY EVEN A </p><p>GREATER ONE THAN IT REALIZES, BUT CUBAN AUTHORITIES </p><p>ALREADY FELT THEMSELVES RUNNING GROWING RISKS.  BY </p><p>MAKING THE THREAT AND PERHAPS IMPLEMENTING IT, THEY HOPE </p><p>TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE U.S. TO ALTER ITS IMMIGRATION </p><p>POLICY IN WAYS WHICH WOULD DIMINISH THE PRESSURES ON </p><p>CUBAN AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
