<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001488 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CA/VO/I, CA/VO/L </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  26598:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: CVIS, PREL, CMGT, AMGT </p><p>SUBJECT:  Advisory Opinion Request:  Restriction on Issuance </p><p>of Non-Immigrant Visas in Honduran Diplomatic Passports </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  In light of the widespread abuse of diplomatic </p><p>passports in Honduras, and the request from the MFA to </p><p>assist the GOH in curbing the misuse of these passports by </p><p>persons not entitled to have them, or by persons no longer </p><p>entitled to use them, Post proposes to modify how we provide </p><p>Non-Immigrant Visas to Honduran citizens who possess </p><p>diplomatic passports.   We submit a draft diplomatic note </p><p>explaining the new restrictions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Background.  Several months ago, MFA officials approached </p><p>us to request help in curbing the unauthorized use of </p><p>Honduran diplomatic passports.  There is little or no </p><p>accountability for diplomatic passport issuance in Honduras </p><p>and persons traveling with them are exempt from paying exit </p><p>fees as well as duties and taxes on goods brought into the </p><p>country.  They also effectively avoid paying the MRV fee. </p><p>The GOH estimates that there are approximately forty </p><p>thousand of these passports currently in circulation.  The </p><p>majority are in the hands of former appointed and elected </p><p>government officials and their families who have terminated </p><p>their official duties, but failed or refused to surrender </p><p>the passports. The GOH has publicly requested the return of </p><p>these passports, without success.  In addition, an unknown </p><p>number of Honduran diplomatic, official, and regular </p><p>passports were stolen from the passport office in San Pedro </p><p>Sula approximately two years ago. </p><p> </p><p>2. We propose sending a diplomatic note to the GOH, a draft </p><p>of which is attached, after we receive your guidance on how </p><p>best to adhere to the regulatory guidelines on providing </p><p>visas of any classification to holders of diplomatic </p><p>passports. </p><p> </p><p>Begin text.  The Embassy of the United States of America </p><p>presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>of the Republic of Honduras and wishes to inform the </p><p>Ministry of a policy change regarding visa applications from </p><p>certain government officials and others who possess </p><p>diplomatic passports. </p><p> </p><p>Effective immediately, bearers of diplomatic passports in </p><p>the following categories are exempt from the $100.00 </p><p>processing fee for nonimmigrant visas:  a) current Head of </p><p>State and alternates; b) current Cabinet ministers and vice </p><p>ministers; c) active duty military officers holding a rank </p><p>not inferior to that of a U.S. Brigadier General or Rear </p><p>Admiral; d) career diplomats; e) ambassadors, officers of </p><p>the diplomatic service, consular officers, and military </p><p>attaches assigned to a foreign diplomatic mission; f) </p><p>officers of delegations assigned to an international </p><p>organization; g) magistrates of the Supreme Court of </p><p>Justice; h) territorial governors and their alternates; i) </p><p>presiding officers of the national legislature; and j) </p><p>spouse and unmarried dependent children of the above. </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy will continue to accept applications for </p><p>diplomatic visas on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday </p><p>from 1:00 p.m. to 1:30 p.m.  All applications must be </p><p>accompanied by a photograph of the applicant, a diplomatic </p><p>note stating the individual\'s government position, and </p><p>travel plans.  The Embassy of the United States requests </p><p>that all persons in possession of a current visa for the </p><p>United States, of any classification, in a non -diplomatic </p><p>passport, present this visa to the consular officer at the </p><p>time of the application for a visa in the bearer\'s </p><p>diplomatic passport.  Persons on the list above will be </p><p>issued visas upon receipt of a diplomatic note that </p><p>expressly states that the bearer is on official duty status </p><p>for the Government of Honduras.  Persons who only possess a </p><p>diplomatic passport, but are traveling on personal business </p><p>or pleasure must also present evidence that they have paid </p><p>the proper visa fee.  Visas are normally issued in three </p><p>business days.  An employee of the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs may drop off the application. </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy of the United States of America avails itself of </p><p>this opportunity to reiterate to the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs the assurances of its highest consideration. </p><p> </p><p>3. We receive a large number of diplomatic notes requesting </p><p>visas for Hondurans who possess diplomatic passports, but </p><p>who have no current official role in Honduran governmental </p><p>affairs.  Some already have valid tourist visas in their </p><p>regular passports, but want visas in their diplomatic </p><p>passports to avoid paying exit fees and duties on consumer </p><p>products.  Many applicants who have diplomatic passports do </p><p>not have valid regular passports.  They want to travel on </p><p>the diplomatic passport for personal business and avoid </p><p>paying the duties, taxes, and the one hundred dollar MRV </p><p>fee. </p><p> </p><p>4. Establishing the proposed modification would provide the </p><p>MFA with the support it needs to refuse diplomatic notes to </p><p>persons using diplomatic passports to get visas for personal </p><p>travel to the U.S.  It would force persons who have regular </p><p>passports, with valid visas, to use them.  It would simplify </p><p>the process for obtaining diplomatic visas.  And, it would </p><p>prevent applicants from using diplomatic passports to avoid </p><p>paying the MRV fee.  We request your opinion on the most </p><p>expeditious manner to correct this misuse of the diplomatic </p><p>privilege. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
