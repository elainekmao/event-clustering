<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001972 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10-22-12 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, KWMM </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 146 (10-22-02) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Lewis Amselem, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  INDIA AND OSLO CONFERENCE </p><p>           MALDIVES GLOBE REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>INDIA AND OSLO CONFERENCE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>1.  (C) DCM met with Mohan Kumar, the Indian Deputy High </p><p>Commissioner, today.  Out of the blue, Kumar said the GoI </p><p>was not planning to participate in the Oslo donors </p><p>conference.  Kumar linked the Indian stance to their </p><p>reluctance to have anything to do with the LTTE.  He </p><p>indicated that high-levels had reviewed the issue and </p><p>concluded that possible photos of high-level Indian </p><p>officials interacting with the LTTE would not be </p><p>acceptable back home.  Kumar, who knew that D was </p><p>planning on attending, urged the U.S. to take a </p><p>low-key approach at the event, so as not to allow the </p><p>LTTE to benefit from it.  We said that was our plan.  He </p><p>added that he had met with the British DCM yesterday and </p><p>urged the UK not to attend, but the Brits have already </p><p>accepted. Kumar added that the GoI was not happy that the </p><p>GSL had agreed to funnel donor assistance to a Joint Task </p><p>Force made up of government and LTTE representatives. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) This is all news to us.  Although India is not </p><p>technically a donor, this was the first we had heard of </p><p>any Indian reluctance to participate in Oslo.  Kumar </p><p>seems like a pretty solid source.  Had you heard any of </p><p>this?  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>MALDIVES GLOBE REQUEST </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>3.  (U) We received written notification (faxed to desk) </p><p>of the GoRM\'s desire to join GLOBE, as mentioned in last </p><p>week\'s cable. In it is the question of who will sign for </p><p>the our side.  We assume it will be the Ambassador on </p><p>behalf of NASA during his next (as yet unplanned) trip to </p><p>Male\'.  Please let us know the procedure so we can brief </p><p>the Maldivians.  Former Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Azeez </p><p>Yoosef will sign for GoRM in his new capacity as Minister </p><p>of Home Affairs, Housing and Environment. (ECON) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
