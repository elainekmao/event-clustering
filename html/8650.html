<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003462 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/EPA (CBOURGEOIS) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO,  OEXC,  SCUL,  JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEPI - ARABIC BOOK TRANSLATION PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 145089 </p><p> </p><p>1.  POST HAS DISCUSSED SUBJECT PROGRAM WITH RELEVANT  JORDAN </p><p>MINISTRY  OF EDUCATION OFFICIALS. THE MOE IS INTERESTED,  IN </p><p>PRINCIPAL,  IN  PARTICIPATION. HOWEVER, THE  FINAL  DECISION </p><p>MUST  BE MADE BY THE MINISTER HIMSELF, WHO WILL ONLY RESPOND </p><p>TO  A WRITTEN PROPOSAL, AND WHO WOULD WANT TO PERSONALLY VET </p><p>THE  BOOKS BEFORE SENDING THEM TO CLASSROOMS. THAT SAID, THE </p><p>INITIATIVE  TRACKS WELL WITH THE MINISTRY\'S OWN EFFORTS  AND </p><p>WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A WELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR PROGRAM FOR </p><p>IMPROVING  CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, PROVIDED THAT THE BOOKS  ARE </p><p>INDEED  CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AND APPROPRIATE  FOR  JORDANIAN </p><p>STUDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SHOULD THE MOE EVENTUALLY DECIDE NOT TO PARTICIPATE,  WE </p><p>EXPECT  THAT A NUMBER OF JORDANIAN PRIVATE SCHOOLS WOULD  BE </p><p>INTERESTED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THERE REMAINS GREAT REGIONAL ANXIETY OVER PERCEIVED U.S. </p><p>INTENTIONS  TO  "INFILTRATE" THE EDUCATION SYSTEMS  OF  ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES  AND  "CORRUPT" ARAB VALUES.  WITH THIS  IN  MIND, </p><p>JORDANIAN  OFFICIALS WOULD DOUBTLESS BE MORE AMENABLE  TO  A </p><p>LOW  KEY  PROGRAM THAT PRODUCES SOLID BENEFITS TO  CHILDREN, </p><p>BUT WHICH FORGOES HIGH PROFILE MEDIA COVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p>4. IF MOE APPROVES, A PILOT PROJECT ON A LIMITED SCALE COULD </p><p>CONCEIVABLY BE LAUNCHED BY JANUARY 2004. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY# </p><p></p></div>
