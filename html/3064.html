<p>UNCLAS ROME 002673 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR A/S PRM, PRM/P, EUR/WE, SA/PAB AND IO/D </p><p>USAID FOR A/AID, AA/DCHA, AA/ANE, DCHA/FFP, PPC/DP, PPC/DC </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02673  031438Z </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR MCHAMBLISS/GAINOR </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA AND NKYLOH/USAID </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR KFULLER AND KDEBLAW </p><p>USUN FOR LSHESTACK </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, AORC, PREF, KUNR, WFP, UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  WFP POST-DELIVERY LOSSES IN BANGLADESH </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. IN BANGLADESHI PORTS DURING 2001, WFP SUSTAINED POST- </p><p>DELIVERY LOSSES OF 2,824 METRIC TONS (VALUED AT USD </p><p>343,388). WFP HAS INSTITUTED A POLICY (CONTAINED IN ITS </p><p>2001-2005 COUNTRY PROGRAM OPERATIONAL CONTRACT WITH THE </p><p>GOB) WHICH STIPULATES THAT FOR BULK WHEAT SHIPMENTS LANDED </p><p>QUANTITIES WILL EQUAL BILL OF LADING QUANTITIES AS </p><p>CONFIRMED BY DRAFT AND LIGHTER SURVEYS. ON ENDEMIC LOSSES, </p><p>A TASK FORCE COMPOSED OF THE GOB AND FOUR MAJOR DONORS IS </p><p>UNDERTAKING A FOUR-MONTH ANALYTICAL STUDY OF THE COMMODITY </p><p>LEAKAGE PROBLEM, WITH A FINAL REPORT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>TO REDUCE LEAKAGES DUE IN EARLY 2003. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. IN MAY 2001, THE WFP SECRETARIAT INFORMED OF A MAJOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02673  031438Z </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH FOOD AID DONORS (U.S., CANADA, OTHERS) TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF SUSPECTED FOOD LEAKAGES TO NON- </p><p>TARGETED BENEFICIARIES THROUGH UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION </p><p>CHANNELS. WFP\'S INITIAL MISGIVINGS CAME FROM A 1997 REQUEST </p><p>IT MADE TO THE INTERNATIONAL FOOD POLICY RESEARCH INSTITUTE </p><p>(IFPRI) TO CARRY OUT A PRELIMINARY STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE </p><p>MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM OF FOOD AID LEAKAGES AND DEVELOP A </p><p>MONITORING METHODOLOGY. IN 1998 A COMPREHENSIVE FOOD </p><p>COMMODITY TRACKING SYSTEM APPRAISAL WAS CARRIED OUT. IN </p><p>1999, THE WFP COUNTRY OFFICE ESTABLISHED A FOOD TRANSPORT </p><p>AND STORAGE MONITORING UNIT. SINCE THEN, EFFORTS HAVE BEEN </p><p>MADE TO INFORM VULNERABLE GROUP AND EMERGENCY OPERATION </p><p>BENEFICIARIES, AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC AT LARGE, OF THEIR </p><p>RIGHTS AND ENTITLEMENTS RELATED TO RATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. IN 2001, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE GERMAN AGENCY FOR </p><p>TECHNICAL COOPERATION (GTZ), THE WFP COUNTRY OFFICE </p><p>DESIGNED A MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E) SYSTEM, WHICH </p><p>WFP HAS REPORTEDLY INTRODUCED ON A SYSTEMATIC BASIS IN ALL </p><p>ITS ACTIVITIES. SIX SUB-OFFICES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED USING </p><p>31 FIELD MONITORS. IN THE VULNERABLE GROUP DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ACTIVITY, THE FIRST THREE OF A PLANNED FORTY WHEAT FLOUR </p><p>MILLING AND FORTIFICATION PLANTS BEGAN OPERATING IN MARCH </p><p>2002, PROVIDING FORTIFIED WHEAT FLOUR TO BENEFICIARIES IN </p><p>SEALED BAGS, THUS REDUCING THE RISK OF LEAKAGE. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>PORT LOSSES </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. WFP HAS ENGAGED ON A TEMPORARY BASIS A PORT CAPTAIN WHO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02673  031438Z </p><p>HAS RECOMMENDED THAT WFP ONLY USE ONE DISCHARGE PORT IN </p><p>FUTURE (CHITTAGONG), AND EMPLOYMENT OF COASTAL LIGHTERS TO </p><p>FORWARD FREIGHT NEEDED IN MONGLA PORT. LIMITING THE USE OF </p><p>MONGLA IS DUE TO PAST SIGNIFICANT LOSSES EXPERIENCED WITH </p><p>BULK WHEAT, OWING MAINLY TO WASTAGE DURING LIGHTERING OF </p><p>BULK COMMODITIES FROM LARGE VESSELS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>5. EVERY CASE OF COMMODITY HEMORRHAGING IN TODAY\'S </p><p>CONSTRAINED BUDGETARY ENVIRONMENT HAS TO BE SWIFTLY AND </p><p>VIGOROUSLY ADDRESSED. SUSPECTED FOOD LEAKAGES BOTH IN </p><p>BANGLADESHI PORTS AND TO NON-TARGETED BENEFICIARIES THROUGH </p><p>UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS HAVE CONSTITUTED A LONG- </p><p>TERM PROBLEM FOR THE WFP PROGRAM. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE </p><p>WFP-DONOR STUDY WILL INDUCE THE GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH TO </p><p>TAKE THE REMEDIAL ACTIONS NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY END </p><p>LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH WFP EFFORTS IN BANGLADESH.
