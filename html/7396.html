<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001381 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PREL, EFIN, KU, IZ, UNCC </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: TRYING TO RESOLVE THE UNCC/RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>FUNDING CHALLENGE </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 1213 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  Decisions will be made soon about </p><p>distributions of Iraqi oil revenues that may have significant </p><p>political as well as economic ramifications.  Our GOK </p><p>contacts accept in principle the idea of reducing the </p><p>percentage of Iraqi oil revenues paid into the UN </p><p>Compensation Commission (UNCC) fund, but any attempt to </p><p>change the mechanisms for adjudication and payment of claims, </p><p>or a deep cut in the revenue flow, will alienate our Kuwaiti </p><p>coalition partners.  Therefore it is of vital importance that </p><p>we work closely with the GOK as we develop our thinking. </p><p>Moreover, it will be better for both of us if any new </p><p>proposals are seen as Kuwaiti proposals.  This message is </p><p>intended to provide food for thought as Washington policy </p><p>makers develop U.S. positions on these issues.  It argues </p><p>that a more stable flow of oil exports from Iraq will allow </p><p>for cuts in the percentages for the Oil for Food program and </p><p>the UN Compensation Committee without a concomitant fall in </p><p>revenues for those programs, while at the same time providing </p><p>sufficient funds for reconstruction and humanitarian needs. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The GOK fully understands and supports the need to </p><p>quickly rebuild Iraq, realizing that a prosperous and stable </p><p>state on its Northern border is vital to its own prosperity </p><p>and stability.  However, GOK officials are also adamant that </p><p>any new Iraqi government must fully comply with all UN </p><p>Security Council resolutions.  Thus, they are wary of any </p><p>plan to drastically reduce UNCC payments in a way detrimental </p><p>to adequate compensation for very real damages inflicted by </p><p>Iraq\'s 1990-1991 invasion and occupation of Kuwait.  Kuwait </p><p>has been the USG\'s most indispensable partner in the fight </p><p>against Saddam\'s regime, and therefore the USG should now </p><p>work closely with the GOK to ensure its views are taken into </p><p>account.  Indeed, GOK officials have told us that they would </p><p>like any proposals regarding changes in the distribution of </p><p>Iraq\'s oil revenue to come from Kuwait.  We believe that such </p><p>a step would have important positive domestic, bilateral, and </p><p>regional implications.  Domestically the GOK will be able to </p><p>demonstrate that it stood up for Kuwaiti rights; bilaterally, </p><p>Kuwait can demonstrate its concern for Iraqi reconstruction; </p><p>and regionally, the GOK will be able to say that it is not a </p><p>passive bystander but an active architect of regional policy </p><p>initiatives.  All of these factors also serve U.S. interests. </p><p> </p><p>LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF)    The current formula divides revenues 72 percent </p><p>to the Oil for Food (OFF) program, 25 percent for UNCC funds, </p><p>and 3 percent for UNIKOM and other miscellaneous expenses. </p><p>The problem is how to carve out funds for reconstruction from </p><p>this mix without compromising UNCC payments. First, it should </p><p>be noted that Iraq sold around 400,000 barrels of oil per day </p><p>(bpd) to neighbors like Jordan and Syria at heavily </p><p>discounted prices.  Further, illicit oil trade (also over </p><p>400,000 bpd for most of the past years) can be expected to </p><p>cease.  Given relatively light damage to key Iraqi oil </p><p>installations, this suggests an additional 800,000 bpd of oil </p><p>and oil products will be available for export through the OFF </p><p>program almost immediately.  (One estimate we\'ve seen is that </p><p>restoring such trade at international market prices alone </p><p>would have generated an extra $1.1 billion in 2001 and an </p><p>extra $1.5 billion in 2002.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) Beyond restoring this illicit and discounted Iraqi </p><p>oil to the revenue stream, we should recall that over the </p><p>years Saddam continually manipulated the flow of Iraqi oil </p><p>for his political purposes.  Again, given the relatively </p><p>light damage to Iraqi oil facilities, it is entirely possible </p><p>that Iraq could relatively quickly return to its pre-invasion </p><p>production capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day (mmbd). </p><p>With an estimated 300,000 bpd consumed domestically, Iraq </p><p>could have 2.8 mmbd of oil to sell at international prices. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF)  2.8 mmbd at a projected price of $22.50 a barrel </p><p>(assuming a likely fall in prices to historical averages </p><p>after the end of the war) yields nearly $23 billion a year. </p><p>In 2002, according to numbers we\'ve seen, Iraq sold about 2.0 </p><p>mmbd at a similar price, which would have yielded total </p><p>revenue of just under $16.5 billion.  $16.5 billion in 2002 </p><p>divided according to the previous formula yields $11.88 </p><p>billion for OFF, $4.125 billion for UNCC, and $0.495 billion </p><p>for UNIKOM/Misc.  (Caveat: Note that these and all following </p><p>figures are post estimates; even if the actual amounts differ </p><p>slightly, the same principle should hold.)   If the same </p><p>formula is applied to our estimate of $23 billion for </p><p>post-war oil revenues, we could expect $16.56 billion for </p><p>OFF, $5.75 billion for UNCC, and $0.69 billion for </p><p>UNIKOM/Misc. </p><p>6.(S/NF)  However, if one assumes that the actual dollar </p><p>contributions to OFF, UNCC and UNIKOM in 2002 were adequate </p><p>to meet current needs for those programs, then the </p><p>distribution formula could be altered significantly, and </p><p>still leave enough revenues for their needs.  For example </p><p>(see table), on these assumptions, a distribution of 52 </p><p>percent for OFF, 18 percent for UNCC and 2 percent for </p><p>UNIKOM/Misc. should provide ample funding for these programs </p><p>and still leave 28 percent (or over $6.2 billion) for </p><p>reconstruction. </p><p> </p><p>               Current     Current    New         New </p><p>               Distr.      Revenue    Distr.      Revenue </p><p>               Formula     Distr.     Formula    Distr. </p><p>               (percent)   ($bn)      (percent)   ($bn) </p><p> </p><p>OFF              72         11.88        52        11.96 </p><p>UNCC             25          4.125       18         4.14 </p><p>UNIKOM            3          0.495        2         0.69 </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION    0          0           28         6.21 </p><p> </p><p>Total Revenues  100         16.5        100        23.0 </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) As can be seen, Kuwait could actually propose a seven </p><p>percentage point cut in the UNCC contribution and still </p><p>expect to see a slight gain in UNCC revenues.  More </p><p>importantly, this formula allows 28 percent of Iraqi oil </p><p>revenues to flow to reconstruction costs ($6.21 billion). </p><p>Although Iraq\'s long-term needs are enormous, we doubt that </p><p>the country could absorb higher levels of reconstruction </p><p>investment efficiently. </p><p> </p><p>GENERATING MORE RECONSTRUCTION REVENUES </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) One of the most important areas for early </p><p>reconstruction and investment efforts must be agriculture. </p><p>Iraq has a history of being a bread-basket for the region, </p><p>but decades of mismanagement have devastated the sector. </p><p>Reversing the damage caused by draining marshes, and </p><p>rebuilding irrigation systems damaged by years of neglect, </p><p>may take years, but early gains are possible.  (One key step </p><p>will be quickly resolving questions of land ownership.) </p><p>Reviving agriculture will have many benefits, including </p><p>providing jobs for the Iraqi people, but one of the most </p><p>important will be reducing reliance on imported food and </p><p>therefore freeing up OFF funds to be shifted to </p><p>reconstruction. </p><p> </p><p>DEBT RELIEF </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.(C)  The Government of Kuwait has also expressed to us its </p><p>support for a debt relief program, but with an important </p><p>caveat; the program should concentrate on debts incurred </p><p>during the period UN sanctions were in place.  Their argument </p><p>is that loans incurred during that period reduced the effects </p><p>of sanctions and helped keep Saddam in power.  We believe </p><p>that such a debt relief proposal could be a useful complement </p><p>to any package to change the UNCC contribution formulas.  It </p><p>could also be used as a foil to fend off any aggressive raids </p><p>on the UNCC by the French, Germans, etc. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) Beyond generating funds for governmental </p><p>reconstruction efforts, it is vital that the private sector </p><p>is brought in to do its part.  Reftel contained post </p><p>suggestions on rapidly building trade and investment </p><p>promotion plans to revive private sector interest in Iraq, a </p><p>country we and the Kuwaitis have been locked out of for </p><p>nearly 13 years.  Beyond this, septel will suggest specific </p><p>mechanisms to encourage Iraq\'s closest and wealthiest </p><p>neighbors, the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to </p><p>play their part in the reconstruction effort. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
