(C) UNITED NATIONS RESIDENT COORDINATOR CARLOS LOPES </p><p>INFORMED AMBASSADOR MCDONALD LATE ON JUNE 8 THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT REFUGEE COMMITTEE HAD DELIBERATED </p><p>ON THE CASE OF THE CUBAN DOCTORS LEONEL CORDOVA </p><p>RODRIGUEZ AND NORIS PENA MARTINEZ FOR THREE HOURS AND </p><p>TOOK NO FORMAL DECISION.  INSTEAD, THE ZIMBABWEAN PANEL </p><p>DECIDED TO GRANT "TEMPORARY REFUGEE STATUS" TO THE PAIR, </p><p>RELEASED THEM FROM PRISON AND HANDED THEM OVER TO THE </p><p>CUSTODY OF THE UNHCR.  THE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING, LOPES </p><p>STATED, WAS THAT THE CUBANS WOULD BE RESETTLED PROMPTLY </p><p>IN A THIRD COUNTRY.  ACCORDING TO LOPES, LUSAKA-BASED </p><p>UNCHR ATTORNEY MICHAEL SALOMONS WAS NOW SCHEDULED TO </p><p>ARRIVE IN HARARE ON JUNE 10. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE JOHN ADU TOLD CONSUL EARLIER </p><p>THAT THE TWO DOCTORS WERE IN HIS CUSTODY, BUT THAT HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03096  081622Z </p><p>DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE SAFE IN THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN IMMIGRATION SERVICE\'S TRANSIT FACILITY. </p><p>THEREFORE, ADU SAID THAT TWO DOCTORS WOULD BE HOUSED IN </p><p>THE GOZ\'S REMAND FACILITIES.  ADU TOLD CONSUL THAT </p><p>DOCTORS CORDOVA AND PENA WERE IN HIS OFFICE AND THAT HE </p><p>INTENDED TO ACCOMPANY THEM TO THE REMAND CENTERS TO </p><p>ASCERTAIN THE EXACT LOCATION OF EACH.  DOCTOR CORDOVA IS </p><p>TO BE HOUSED AT A FACILITY IN DOWNTOWN HARARE, WHILE </p><p>DOCTOR PENA WILL STAY AT CHIKURUBI REMAND CENTER, ON THE </p><p>GROUNDS OF ZIMBABWE\'S ONE MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON, JUST </p><p>OUTSIDE OF HARARE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: WE CANNOT RULE OUT SOMETHING GOING </p><p>WRONG IN THE COMING DAYS, WHETHER IT IS THE CUBANS </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO SPIRIT THE TWO OUT OF ZIMBABWE OR </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE RECONSIDERING AND DECIDING THAT THIS IS </p><p>NOT THE OUTCOME HE WANTED FOR THE CASE.  THE SITUATION </p><p>ARGUES FOR QUICK PROCESSING OF THE DOCTORS AND THEIR </p><p>TRANSFER TO U.S. SOIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
