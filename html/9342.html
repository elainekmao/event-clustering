<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 001642 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, INR/B, DRL/IRF, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KJUS, PHUM, HO, VA </p><p>SUBJECT: A LATIN AMERICAN POPE?  CARDINAL RODRIGUEZ DEEMED </p><p>PAPABILE, SPECULATION MAY AID HIS ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. TEGUCIGALPA 625 </p><p>     B. TEGUCIGALPA 1534 </p><p>     C. VATICAN 4582 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Section Chief, Francisco L. Palmieri; Reasons </p><p>1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary.  Pope John Paul II\'s increasing frailty has </p><p>prompted discussion over potential successors to the papacy, </p><p>among which experts have identified Cardinal Oscar Andres </p><p>Maradiaga Rodriguez of Honduras as both a popular and </p><p>geographically strategic candidate.  Despite the Euro-centric </p><p>tradition of the papacy, some Vatican experts believe that </p><p>the next pontiff may, in fact, be a Latin American.  Cardinal </p><p>Rodriguez, Archbishop of Tegucigalpa is viewed as a strong </p><p>choice among Latin American cardinals eligible for the </p><p>position, both for his insider connections and international </p><p>reputation as a champion of social justice and political </p><p>transparency in his home country of Honduras.  In Honduras, </p><p>because of this status, the media pays special attention to </p><p>his public pronouncements.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Latin America: The Church\'s Fastest Growing Constituency </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  While European and American church membership has </p><p>sharply declined in recent years, the developing world (and </p><p>Latin America, in particular) has experienced the opposite </p><p>trend.  Today, home to more than half of the world\'s </p><p>Catholics, Latin America has increasingly emerged as the new </p><p>face of Catholicism in the 21st century.  Reflecting the </p><p>rapid increase in church membership, the region is now </p><p>represented by a powerful 22-Cardinal voting electorate for </p><p>the papacy, which is the second largest regional voting block </p><p>(next to Europe). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  In addition to Cardinal Rodriguez, other strong </p><p>candidates from the region identified in REFtel C and by the </p><p>media include: Dario Catrillon Hoyos (74) of Colombia; Jorge </p><p>Mario Bergoglio (66) of Argentina; Claudio Hummes (68) of </p><p>Brazil; Norberto Rivera Carrera (61) of Mexico; and Alfonso </p><p>Lopez Trujillo (67) of Colombia.  While many experts believe </p><p>Rodriguez to be among the top few potential candidates, some </p><p>have also indicated that the Cardinal\'s relative youth, at 60 </p><p>years of age, may prove a potential obstacle among an older </p><p>voting electorate.  Additionally, the Cardinal\'s health is </p><p>not 100 percent.  He allegedly suffers from diabetes, for </p><p>which he apparently spent a month in a German hospital last </p><p>fall.  Also, his life has been threatened repeatedly in </p><p>Honduras.  (See REFtel A.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>Speculation Draws Greater Attention to the Cardinal\'s Battles </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment.  Even though the timeframe for the next </p><p>papal election is indeterminable, widespread media </p><p>speculation among experts and the press regarding Cardinal </p><p>Rodriguez\'s potential candidacy has nonetheless had an </p><p>impact.  Voted the third most powerful public figure in </p><p>Honduras (behind President Maduro and the Ambassador) earlier </p><p>this year, the Cardinal has been featured even more </p><p>prominently in the press recently.  Should the Cardinal </p><p>emerge publicly as a contender for the papacy in the coming </p><p>months, his high profile campaigns will likely receive </p><p>increased moral and political weight.  Given the close </p><p>relationship between the Ambassador and Cardinal Rodriguez, </p><p>the Cardinal\'s popular moral authority represents an </p><p>increased opportunity to rally additional Honduran support </p><p>for many of our shared priorities, including fighting </p><p>narco-corruption, violence and poverty.  At the same time, it </p><p>is important to note that the Cardinal has, at times, </p><p>criticized several U.S. policies, such as the War in Iraq, </p><p>CAFTA, and the level of international assistance to the </p><p>developing world.
