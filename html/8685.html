<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001209 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS AND AF/S RAYNOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT IMF AND ZIMBABWE; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Embrace the devil" the independent </p><p>      weekly "The Financial Gazette" dedicated its June 12 </p><p>      editorial to encouraging the government of Zimbabwe </p><p>      "to seek rapprochement and mend fences" with the </p><p>      International Monetary Fund (IMF) "for the good of </p><p>      the nation."  The call comes hard on the heels of </p><p>      the suspension of Zimbabwe\'s voting rights in the </p><p>      IMF.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .A wide cross-section of Zimbabweans greeted news </p><p>      of the suspension of the country\'s voting rights with </p><p>      collective trepidation because they know only too well what </p><p>      this means and its implications - Zimbabwe\'s credit rating. </p><p>      . .has been reduced to junk status, a red flag which will </p><p>      not escape the attention of the international financier </p><p>      community.  With the IMF funding on ice, Zimbabwe is now in </p><p>      a very deep hole because no matter how far the country </p><p>      passes the hat, no international financier will twitch. </p><p>      The decision by the IMF to suspend Zimbabwe will now set </p><p>      the stage for the stiffening of the hands of the other </p><p>      international institutions that have been sitting on the </p><p>      sidelines waiting to take the cue on Zimbabwe from the IMF. </p><p>      What the IMF has done will only help to convince the world </p><p>      that Zimbabwe has its needle well and truly stuck, so to </p><p>      speak. . .To these financiers the IMF\'s move on Zimbabwe is </p><p>      a wake-up call: they will not touch Zimbabwe even with a </p><p>      barge pole. . .Be that as it may, with the economy having </p><p>      collapsed into a recessionary heap we do not have much of a </p><p>      choice. . .We feel that we have no option but to </p><p>      seek rapprochement and mend fences with the IMF. </p><p>      Whether we like it or not we have to bite the bullet </p><p>      and knuckle down to the IMF demands for the good of </p><p>      the nation.  Given our predicament, the IMF is a </p><p>      necessary evil that, if it comes back to Zimbabwe, </p><p>      could trigger a massive inflow of external funds </p><p>      into the country and help us stabilize our </p><p>      finances. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
