<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002197 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY APRIL 4:  GOOD NEWS ON U.S. </p><p>PACKAGE, EXPECTED GOOD NEWS ON IMF LETTER OF INTENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lira Appreciates on Good News From U.S. </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) News that both houses of Congress passed the </p><p>supplemental appropriation of $1 billion for Turkey buoyed </p><p>the money markets in morning trading April 4.   The lira </p><p>appreciated about one percent to TL 1,655,000.  The Istanbul </p><p>Stock Exchange was up 2.3 percent in morning trading.  The </p><p>benchmark T-bill was unchanged at 63 percent compounded. </p><p>2.  (SBU) Markets are waiting for the GOT to sign the IMF </p><p>letter of intent.  Local press carried good news on this </p><p>front from IMF spokesman Dawson, who predicted a mid-April </p><p>board date for the Fourth Review.  IMF resrep told us he has </p><p>not heard back from the GOT about signing the LOI, that </p><p>MinState Babacan is in Istanbul for European Investment Bank </p><p>meetings, and that the LOI could be signed anytime, </p><p>preferably today (for preparing markets ahead of the April 8 </p><p>debt auctions). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>March Inflation Higher Than Expected </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  On April 3, the State Statistics Institute released </p><p>March inflation data that were slightly higher than market </p><p>expectations of CPI increase in the 2.2 - 2.5 percent range. </p><p>The numbers were: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>               March 2003    March 2002 </p><p>               ----------    ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Consumer </p><p>Price Index      3.2 pct      1.9 pct </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wholesale </p><p>Price Index      3.1 pct      1.2 pct </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment:  March\'s higher than expected CPI reflects </p><p>a jump in food prices, owing to cold weather, and thus should </p><p>not affect interest rates in the T-bill auctions April 8. </p><p>But the upward trend of CPI inflation is a concern, given </p><p>March is higher than February (2.3 pct).  While it\'s still </p><p>too early to predict that the year-end CPI target of 20 </p><p>percent is out of reach, the first quarter trend is not </p><p>promising for forward looking inflationary expectations.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Financial Community Views </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  During a round of meetings April 4, Istanbul </p><p>bankers/economists told EconCouns and Congen Pol-Econ chief </p><p>that, while market sentiment had improved enough in the past </p><p>two weeks to reduce fears of a financial crisis/debt default </p><p>in the very short-term, the best-case scenario is that the </p><p>government manages to muddle through for a few months, with </p><p>the hoped-for arrival of U.S. assistance perhaps extending </p><p>that muddle-through period into late summer or fall. </p><p>Investors expressed no confidence in this government\'s </p><p>ability to manage the economy successfully, and a few bankers </p><p>asserted that some kind of domestic debt restructuring was </p><p>inevitable. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
