<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002480 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PAPER ACCUSES U.S. AND BRITAIN OF </p><p>"GUNBOAT DIPLOMACY" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under the headline "Zimbabwe is no colony" the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "Sunday News" dedicated </p><p>      its November 10 editorial to accusing the United </p><p>      States and Britain of practicing "gunboat diplomacy." </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.    ". . .This week, the Deputy Secretary of State </p><p>      for African Affairs in the U.S. Government, Mark </p><p>      Bellamy, was quoted as saying Washington is plotting </p><p>      interventionist measures that will challenge </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s sovereignty.  Simply put, the American </p><p>      warmongers are planning a military invasion of </p><p>      Zimbabwe and are setting up the pretext for such an </p><p>      operation by making outrageous allegations of human </p><p>      rights abuse, breakdown of the rule of law and the </p><p>      persecution of opposition members.  While this </p><p>      revelation has an American face, the real schemer is </p><p>      Tony Blair.  The sheer hypocrisy of this Anglo-Saxon </p><p>      alliance is phenomenal.  By any measure of </p><p>      international law, Western leaders have been some of </p><p>      the modern era\'s greatest prima facie terrorists and </p><p>      war criminals. . .  Ranging from President Bill </p><p>      Clinton\'s bombing of Sudan and Madeline Albright\'s </p><p>      veto of an international rescue for Rwanda when she </p><p>      was U.S. Ambassador to the UN, to the Bush dynasty\'s </p><p>      genocide of millions of innocent Iraqi children, there </p><p>      is plenty of evidence of their crimes against </p><p>      humanity.  It would be folly to believe that the </p><p>      heavily militarized foreign policy of Britain and the </p><p>      U.S. is driven by a genuine crusade to serve humanity. </p><p>      Rather, it is driven by their obsession with political </p><p>      control and economic dominance.  So, in all respects </p><p>      there is a resurgence of 19th century gunboat </p><p>      diplomacy in an era when 21st century internationalism </p><p>      had given so much false promise for world peace and </p><p>      prosperity. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
