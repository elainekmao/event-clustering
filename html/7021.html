<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 001197 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, INR/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EAID, PINR, IZ, LY, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WRAP-UP: MARCH 29 TO APRIL 1, </p><p>2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  The National Assembly voiced strong support for </p><p>Operation Iraqi Freedom, approved the GOK\'s supplemental </p><p>budget request of approximately $1.6 billion, and debated </p><p>punishing hostile states by withholding loans from the Kuwait </p><p>Fund for Arab Economic Development.  The mood of defiance </p><p>prompted Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmed to remind MPs that Kuwait is </p><p>and will remain an Arab country.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. The National Assembly session on March 31 opened with </p><p>formal expressions of support for the U.S. led military </p><p>action in Iraq and a storm of criticism against those Arab </p><p>nations which have not condemned ongoing Iraqi missile </p><p>strikes against Kuwait.  (NOTE:  The Kuwaiti argument is that </p><p>the coalition\'s first attacks were carried out by cruise </p><p>missiles launched from platforms outside Kuwait, and that </p><p>Iraq struck first against Kuwait; accordingly, Kuwait </p><p>considers the Iraqi surface-to-surface missile strikes to be </p><p>acts of aggression.  They also argue that the attacks seem </p><p>aimed at civilian rather than military targets.  END NOTE.) </p><p>Poloff and PolFSN attended the March 31 session; MPs showered </p><p>them both with expressions of support for the war and for the </p><p>US role in it. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Moving into closed-door session, the National Assembly </p><p>then voted 39 to 4 (with 9 abstentions) to pass the KD500 </p><p>million (approx $1.6 billion) supplemental budget requested </p><p>by the government.  The supplement will meet the cost of </p><p>emergency security needs resulting from the current situation </p><p>in the region.  The Ministry of Defense will receive KD200 </p><p>million, the Ministry of the Interior KD121 million, the </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs KD30 million, the Ministry of </p><p>Information KD12 million, the National Guard KD5 million, and </p><p>various other government departments will share the remaining </p><p>KD129 million. </p><p> </p><p>4.  As a result of the mob attack on the Kuwaiti Embassy in </p><p>Tripoli, the GOK expelled the Libyan ambassador to Kuwait. </p><p>MP Marzouk Al-Hbaini praised the government\'s action as a </p><p>step in the right direction, but stated "we still look </p><p>forward to closing the embassy as this will be a message to </p><p>all that he who does not respect Kuwait and its sovereignty </p><p>will not be respected by the Kuwaiti people." </p><p> </p><p>5.  Deputy Speaker Meshari Al-Anjari and a number of other </p><p>MPs introduced a draft bill to suspend for two years all aid </p><p>and loans extended by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic </p><p>Development (KFAED).  The MPs want to consider existing and </p><p>future aid requests in light of recent developments in both </p><p>the Arab and broader international arenas in order to most </p><p>effectively achieve the political and strategic goals of the </p><p>state.  Al-Anjari expressed his belief the amendment would </p><p>enable the government to reconsider its loan policy pursuant </p><p>to Kuwait\'s higher interests.  The intent was unmistakable: </p><p>punish those states that have benefitted from Kuwaiti aid but </p><p>now castigate Kuwait for its role in support of Operation </p><p>Iraqi Freedom. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The National Assembly called on the Financial and </p><p>Economic Affairs Committee to submit its report on the above </p><p>amendment by April 9 so that the bill can be debated during </p><p>the April 14 session.  The National Assembly also agreed to </p><p>prioritize draft bills on the redistribution of electoral </p><p>constituencies and on amendments to the children\'s allowance; </p><p>both will be debated before mid-April. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  As Kuwaitis realize how isolated they are in </p><p>the Arab world, they are growing more defiant.  So much so </p><p>that First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Shaykh </p><p>Sabah al-Ahmed sought to calm MPs, reminding the National </p><p>Assembly that Kuwait is and will remain an Arab country. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
