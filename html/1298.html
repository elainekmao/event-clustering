(SBU) UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE AND UN RESIDENT </p><p>COORDINATOR IN ZIMBABWE VICTOR ANGELO BRIEFED DONORS ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 28 ON THE TERMS OF REFERENCE OF A FIVE-PERSON </p><p>MISSION SENT TO LOOK FOR POSSIBLE AREAS OF ENGAGEMENT ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM.  THIS MISSION IS A </p><p>FOLLOW-UP TO THE RECENT "MINI-LAND SUMMIT" AT UNGA IN </p><p>NEW YORK, WHERE IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE UN MIGHT PLAY </p><p>A "FOCAL ROLE" IN ASSISTING TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE (REF </p><p>B).  PRINCIPALLY THE TEAM WILL DETERMINE WHETHER A SOUND </p><p>TECHNICAL PROCESS CAN BE ESTABLISHED GUIDED BY AND </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES AGREED AT THE 1998 LAND </p><p>DONORS\' CONFERENCE.  THE IMPRESSIVELY QUALIFIED TEAM, </p><p>WHICH ARRIVED ON SEPTEMBER 26 AND WILL DEPART ON OCTOBER </p><p>13, CONSISTS OF DR. JACQUES CHONCHOL (CHILE), AN EXPERT </p><p>ON LAND REFORM; PLINIO SAMPAIO (BRAZIL) AN EXPERT IN </p><p>ANALYSIS AND APPRAISAL OF LAND REFORM AND AGRICULTURE; </p><p>PROFESSOR H.W.O. OKOTH-OGENDO (KENYA) AN EXPERT IN LAND </p><p>LAW AND LEGISLATION; KENNETH ALLISON (JAMAICA), AN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05514  01 OF 02  281451Z </p><p>EXPERT IN PROPERTY EVALUATION; AND JEAN BARUT, (BURUNDI) </p><p>A SENIOR UNDP ECONOMIST.  THE UNDP RESIDENT COORDINATOR </p><p>INVITED THE HEAVILY ATTENDED MEETING PARTICIPANTS TO </p><p>RETURN OCTOBER 12 FOR AN OUT-BRIEFING BY THE TEAM ON ITS </p><p>FINDINGS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) THE UNDP RESREP REPORTED THAT THE TEAM\'S FIRST </p><p>MEETING HAD BEEN WITH NEWLY INSTALLED MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMANENT SECRETARY WILLARD CHIWEWE, WHO </p><p>WILL BE THE TEAM\'S GOVERNMENT POINT OF CONTACT, AND WILL </p><p>CHAIR ALL MEETINGS ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE.  WHILE </p><p>CALLING THE MISSION\'S VISIT "A NEW BEGINNING," CHIWEWE </p><p>IMMEDIATELY LAID DOWN A MARKER: THE GOVERNMENT\'S "FAST </p><p>TRACK" APPROACH TO LAND REFORM WAS "NON-NEGOTIABLE" AND </p><p>COULD NOT BE CHALLENGED.  ANGELO SUGGESTED THAT TO </p><p>OVERCOME THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT\'S INITIAL HARD-LINE </p><p>POSITION THE TEAM WOULD PROBABLY PROPOSE THREE </p><p>SCENARIOS, STARTING WITH A SHORT-TERM ONE (LEAST </p><p>FEASIBLE) AND PROCEEDING TO A LONG-TERM (MOST FEASIBLE) </p><p>ONE.  THE SENIOR ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMAT HOPED THE MISSION </p><p>WOULD BREAK NEW GROUND IN FINDING A WAY OF RELAUNCHING </p><p>THE DIALOGUE ON LAND.  ANGELO CONTINUED THAT THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS WOULD DEPLOY A "MIRROR MISSION" TO LOOK INTO THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW, WHICH HE SAID WAS A SINE QUA NON FOR A </p><p>TECHNICALLY SOUND LAND REFORM PROCESS.  THE UNDP RESREP </p><p>TOOK PAINS TO ASSURE HIS DONOR LISTENERS THAT THE TEAM </p><p>WOULD CONSULT AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLY WITH ALL </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS.  A SUBTEXT OF ITS ENGAGEMENT WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS THE NEED TO REACH DOMESTIC CONSENSUS ON A </p><p>MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE PLAN OF ACTION, AND THUS IT WOULD AT </p><p>EVERY OPPORTUNITY REMIND ITS GOVERNMENT INTERLOCUTORS TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05514  01 OF 02  281451Z </p><p>ENTER INTO DIALOGUE WITH CIVIL SOCIETY.  BY OCTOBER 12 </p><p>THE TEAM HOPED TO PRESENT ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT </p><p>OF THE FAST TRACK PLAN.  AMONG THOSE ASPECTS IT WILL </p><p>INVESTIGATE IS WHETHER THE PROGRAM IS SUSTAINABLE, WHAT </p><p>IS ITS IMPACT ON CONSIDERATIONS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, </p><p>EQUITY, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE COUNTRY\'S NATURAL </p><p>RESOURCE BASE.  THE TEAM WILL ALSO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF </p><p>THE FAST TRACK PROCESS ON THE SUB-REGION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ALTHOUGH ANGELO\'S PRESENTATION GENERATED LITTLE </p><p>DEBATE OR QUESTIONING OF THE MISSION\'S PURPOSE, VARIOUS </p><p>DONORS INTERVENED WITH OBSERVATIONS OF WHICH THE UNDP </p><p>RESREP TOOK NOTE.  THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>IN TERMS OF DONOR ASSISTANCE TO ZIMBABWE\'S LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO REINVENT THE WHEEL.  THE </p><p>1998 DONORS\' CONFERENCE HAD PRODUCED MUCH LITERATURE AND </p><p>WILLARD CHIWEWE HAD BEEN CHAIRMAN OF A KEY WORKING GROUP </p><p>AT THE CONFERENCE HAMMERING OUT GOVERNMENT DONOR </p><p>AGREEMENTS.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT UNLESS RULE OF </p><p>LAW WAS ESTABLISHED ON THE FARMS THERE WAS NO POINT IN </p><p>GOING AHEAD WITH LAND REFORM ASSISTANCE, AND URGED THE </p><p>UN/UNDP MISSION TO TAKE ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT ECONOMIC </p><p>SITUATION INTO ACCOUNT AS IT FORMULATED ITS </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS.  A EUROPEAN UNION (EU) REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>STRESSED THE NEED FOR DOMESTIC DIALOGUE AND NOTED THAT </p><p>FEW DONORS UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7403 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05514  02 OF 02  281451Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OES-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /012W </p><p>                  ------------------8AFA87  281455Z /38 </p><p>O 281453Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7228 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 005514 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VNEWTON, AND A/AID RMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05514  02 OF 02  281451Z </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/28/2010 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, UNDP, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDP RESREP BRIEFS DONORS ON UN/UNDP </p><p>MISSION TO REVIEW ZIMBABWE\'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>PROGRAM ENTAILED.  HE CAUTIONED THE MISSION MEMBERS THAT </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LAND REFORM AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM WAS NOT CLEAR AND DIVIDED AMONG </p><p>SEVERAL CENTERS, BUT PRESIDENT MUGABE ALWAYS HAD THE </p><p>LAST WORD.  ANOTHER EU REPRESENTATIVE ADVISED THE </p><p>MISSION NOT TO REPORT IT HAD REACHED EVEN PARTIAL </p><p>CONSENSUS WHEN NONE IN FACT EXISTED, AS HAD BEEN THE </p><p>EXPERIENCE OF SEVERAL MISSIONS THAT HAD COME TO ZIMBABWE </p><p>WITH SIMILAR MANDATES.  THE AUSTRALIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER </p><p>RECEIVED ASSURANCES FROM THE TEAM THAT THE MISSION WOULD </p><p>COORDINATE ITS WORK WITH THE WORLD BANK, WHICH IS </p><p>STARTING WORK ON A MODELING ACTIVITY DESIGNED TO ASSESS </p><p>THE VARIOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT ZIMBABWE </p><p>LAND REFORM SCENARIOS.  A JAPANESE AID OFFICER URGED THE </p><p>TEAM TO INCLUDE IN ITS REPORT SOME MENTION OF THE IMPACT </p><p>ON THE SOME 2 MILLION FARM WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES </p><p>WHO STAND TO BE DISPLACED BY THE FAST TRACK PROGRAM. </p><p>THE JAPANESE DIPLOMAT ALSO ASKED THE MISSION TO LOOK </p><p>CLOSELY AT THE CRITERIA FOR BENEFICIARIES OF LAND </p><p>REFORM, AND FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE FAST TRACK PROGRAM </p><p>TO DATE.  THE NEW ZEALAND HIGH COMMISSIONER CALLED FOR A </p><p>PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL NO MATTER WHAT THE </p><p>POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES, AND NOTED THAT CARE SHOULD BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05514  02 OF 02  281451Z </p><p>TAKEN TO ASSIGN LAND TO THOSE WHO WERE CAPABLE OF </p><p>FARMING IT, WHO WERE FEW.  RESPONDING TO A DUTCH </p><p>DIPLOMAT\'S QUESTION OF WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT STEP </p><p>FOLLOWING SUBMISSION OF THE TEAM\'S REPORT, VICTOR ANGELO </p><p>REPLIED THAT THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>DECIDE, BUT THAT BEYOND THAT, NOT MUCH THOUGHT HAD BEEN </p><p>GIVEN TO THE MATTER.  FINALLY, A SWEDISH AID OFFICIAL </p><p>COMMENTED THAT THE TEAM LIKELY WOULD FIND MANY BRIDGES </p><p>ON TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE SHARED </p><p>BY VERY SENIOR OFFICIALS, INCLUDING MINISTERS.  HE </p><p>ADVISED THE TEAM TO STAY IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH </p><p>CHIWEWE, ARGUABLY MUGABE\'S MOST TRUSTED CIVIL SERVANT, </p><p>TO DETERMINE THE POLITICAL FEASIBILITY OF THOSE </p><p>TECHNICAL PROPOSALS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: OUR COLLEAGUES WERE FOR THE MOST PART </p><p>THE VERY MODEL OF OLD-FASHIONED DIPLOMATS FACED WITH A </p><p>PROPOSITION ABOUT WHICH THEY WERE LESS THAN </p><p>ENTHUSIASTIC: OBLIQUE, POLITE, AND NON-COMMITTAL.  THOSE </p><p>WHO SPOKE CLEARLY, HOWEVER, MADE IT PLAIN THAT RULE OF </p><p>LAW IS THE ISSUE FOR THE DONOR COMMUNITY, AND IF FAST </p><p>TRACK IS THE ISSUE FOR THE GOVERNMENT, THEN POTENTIALLY </p><p>SERIOUS PROBLEMS LIE AHEAD.  FOR OUR PART, WHILE WE ARE </p><p>IMPRESSED WITH THE ASSEMBLED TEAM, WE QUESTION HOW WE </p><p>CAN GET SOMETHING USEFUL OUT OF SUCH A SHORT TDY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN ZIMBABWE\'S POLARIZED POLITICAL CLIMATE. </p><p>RESREP ANGELO, FOR HIS PART, HAS WALKED INTO A TIGHT </p><p>SPOT.  IF HE IS SEEN AS TOO ACCOMMODATING OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, HE RISKS A CONTENTIOUS TENURE HERE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05514  02 OF 02  281451Z </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
