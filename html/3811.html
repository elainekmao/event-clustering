<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001872 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>CA/OCS/ACS/NESA AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, PTER, PGOV, ASEC, NP </p><p>SUBJECT:  American Climbers Fired Upon Near Tibetan </p><p>Border </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Two men wearing what appeared to </p><p>be military uniforms and carrying automatic weapons </p><p>fired a series of five shots at American climbers </p><p>David Morton and Jeff Lamoureux in the Upper Solu </p><p>Khumbu region near Nepal\'s border with Tibet, Morton </p><p>reported to Post via e-mail.  The incident occurred </p><p>as the Americans were acclimatizing in preparation </p><p>for attempts to record first summits of Nepal\'s newly </p><p>opened peak Nanpai Gosum.  One of the assailants </p><p>reportedly identfied himself as "Chinese military". </p><p>While neither American was injured, their latest e- </p><p>mail communication states they have abandoned their </p><p>summit plans and are being accompanied by Nepali </p><p>police officers to retrieve equipment and personal </p><p>effects they abandoned during the attack at their </p><p>base camp.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  On October 24, the Consular Section </p><p>received a telefax from Seattle-based Alpine Ascents </p><p>International attaching an e-mail addressed to the </p><p>Embassy from David Morton which described the </p><p>shooting incident.  [Note: Writing from Namche </p><p>Bazaar, the central trading village in the Mount </p><p>Everest region of Nepal, Morton had tried to send the </p><p>message directly to Post, but stated it "bounced </p><p>back"].  Morton, a mountain guide, and his climbing </p><p>partner Jeffrey Lamoureux had filed AmCit </p><p>registrations with the Embassy before embarking on an </p><p>attempt to record first-ascents of Nanpai Gosum, a </p><p>24,000 ft. peak newly opened for climbing by the </p><p>Nepali Government last December.  Nanpai Gosum\'s </p><p>three summits lie west of Mount Everest, adjacent to </p><p>the 8,000M Cho Oyo Peak only a few kilometers from </p><p>the Nepal-Tibet border. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Morton\'s initial e-mail reporting the </p><p>shooting states that on September 16, as part of the </p><p>altitude acclimatization process in preparation for a </p><p>summit bid, he and Lamoureux left their base camp </p><p>headed "up towards" Nangpa La Pass, a nearly 19,000 </p><p>ft. pass on the Nepal/Tibetan Chinese border.  [Note: </p><p>Nangpa La is both a trade route and a crossing point </p><p>for Tibetan refugees attempting to gain entry into </p><p>Nepal and/or India.]  On the way to the pass, a man </p><p>armed with an automatic weapon approached them.  The </p><p>man appeared to be of Han Chinese ethnicity, showed </p><p>them what he claimed was his Chinese military uniform </p><p>under his black jacket and said he was a member of </p><p>the Chinese military. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The man, described by Morton as "extremely </p><p>nervous," asked where Morton and Lamoureux were </p><p>coming from, if there were others behind them, where </p><p>their base camp was located, etc.  There is no </p><p>indication that he asked the climbers\' nationalities </p><p>or for money.  During a "very uncomfortable" </p><p>encounter Morton and Lamoureux gave him food and </p><p>water.  He spoke very little English and when Morton </p><p>attempted to communicate in Nepali, he indicated that </p><p>he didn\'t speak that language.  After taking the </p><p>food, the man headed down the trail and Morton and </p><p>Lamoureux continued upward.  However, 20 minutes </p><p>later, they spotted the man watching them from above, </p><p>seated on a glacial moraine. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) After continuing up for another hour, they </p><p>spotted another man, wearing the same type of ski hat </p><p>as the first man they encountered, who ducked behind </p><p>a rock 200 yards up the trail from them. </p><p>Apprehending danger, they decided to go down.  On the </p><p>descent, they had another "awkward" encounter with </p><p>the first interlocutor, to whom they again gave food </p><p>and water.  Ten minutes after he abruptly said "bye," </p><p>they heard the first shot. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) At first Morton attempted to dismiss the </p><p>shot, thinking the men were simply "messing around or </p><p>something."  However, two or three minutes after the </p><p>first shot, Mr. Morton relates "there was a shot </p><p>which came at us and just missed us - we heard the </p><p>bullet go right past our ears."  The two Americans </p><p>began running, ditched their packs so they could move </p><p>faster and stopped on occasion behind rocks to catch </p><p>their breaths "because it was so difficult (16,000 </p><p>ft.)."  The two men continued their pursuit and fired </p><p>a total of five shots during the chase.  Morton hid </p><p>his money under a rock, and the two Americans </p><p>eventually found a hiding place amidst the rocks </p><p>where they remained for three or four hours. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) When they felt safe enough to move Morton </p><p>and Lamoureux returned to their base camp and, after </p><p>discussing what had occurred with their Nepali cook </p><p>and their porter, decided to descend down toward </p><p>Namche Bazaar as soon as it got dark.  They left base </p><p>camp at 8 p.m. and reached Thame at 5 a.m., arriving </p><p>safely in Namche Bazaar the next day. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) ConOff spoke with the Americans\' local </p><p>trekking agent who had received a second e-mail from </p><p>Morton stating he and Lamoureux had met with the </p><p>military and police in Namche Bazaar and would be </p><p>returning to collect their supplies at base camp in </p><p>the company of two Nepali police officers.  Embassy </p><p>has sent an e-mail to Morton advising of our concern </p><p>and asking him to contact Consul directly upon his </p><p>return to Namche Bazaar.  PolOff advised the MFA </p><p>concerning the shootings within Nepal\'s borders </p><p>during a meeting on September 24.  The MFA was </p><p>unaware of the incident. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Comment:  Morton\'s e-mail indicates his </p><p>uncertainty about the identity of the armed men who </p><p>fired upon him and Lamoureux.  "[A]t first we thought </p><p>perhaps Maoists but this guy was clearly Chinese and </p><p>claimed to not speak Nepali," Morton wrote, adding: </p><p>"[O]ur sirdhar and his Sherpa helper from that valley </p><p>think that they were Chinese police."  He also </p><p>speculated that they could be Chinese bandits. </p><p>Maoist insurgents are not typically found at such </p><p>elevations (16,000 ft.).  In the incidents where </p><p>trekkers have reported encountering purported </p><p>Maoists, the Maoists ususally ask for money.  From </p><p>the details of the terrain given in Morton\'s report, </p><p>it seems clear that, whatever the identity of the </p><p>gunmen, the incident occurred on the Nepal side of </p><p>Nangpa La Pass. </p><p> </p><p>Hale </p><p></p></div>
