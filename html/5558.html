<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000839 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SPECIAL MEDIA REACTION ON SECRETARY POWELL\'S </p><p>UN SPEECH </p><p> </p><p>                     News Reports </p><p> </p><p>-- Secretary Powell\'s U.N. speech yesterday received </p><p>extensive coverage in the Jordanian press, though it </p><p>competed for front-page space with the announcement of </p><p>Jordan\'s general budget for the year 2003.  All daily </p><p>newspapers carried wire service reports about the </p><p>Secretary\'s speech and featured photos of the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Secretary during his speech.  Reports were highlighted </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>under banner color headlines.  Further details and </p><p>photos related to the Secretary\'s presentation were </p><p>carried in inside pages in all papers. </p><p> </p><p>-- Apart from two commentaries, no editorial </p><p>commentary was yet noted on the topic (note: </p><p>Secretary Powell\'s presentation began at 5:30 p.m. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>local time, concluding after the filing time of most </p><p>of Jordan\'s opinion writers.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Banner Headlines </p><p> </p><p>-- Al-Dustour:  "Powell presents `information\' that </p><p>Baghdad describes as `allegations\'". </p><p>-- Al-Arab Al-Yawm:  "Powell presents `the pretexts\' </p><p>for launching the war, while the Security Council </p><p>continues to be divided". </p><p>-- Al-Rai:  "Powell\'s report accuses Iraq of owning </p><p>banned weapons and of dealing with Al-Qa\'eda". </p><p>-- Jordan Times:  "Powell presents US case for war". </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Unconvincing evidence" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (02/06) editorializes:  "Powell\'s 75- </p><p>minute presentation contained little that was new. </p><p>Many people will question the authenticity of these </p><p>documents, and their mere presentation is unlikely to </p><p>change many minds.  Yet, even if we give the United </p><p>States the benefit of the doubt, these new elements </p><p>did not amount to convincing evidence of Iraqi non- </p><p>compliance, or that Iraq presents any real or imminent </p><p>danger to any party.  On Powell\'s claims that Iraq has </p><p>close links with Al-Qa\'eda, we have to wonder why it </p><p>is that reports from all of the leading intelligence </p><p>agencies over the past two years consistently </p><p>contradict this view.  Powell presented precious </p><p>little evidence in this regard, but made allegations </p><p>which can only increase irrational fears about </p><p>terrorism at a time when the war on terrorism is </p><p>faltering precisely because the United States has </p><p>incomprehensibly shifted the focus to Iraq.  The </p><p>battle against terrorism requires serious attention to </p><p>the root causes that fuel support for such violence. </p><p>Creating new myths about `evil\' individuals in order </p><p>to achieve a political goal does not help, especially </p><p>when the United States has a poor record of catching </p><p>such individuals once it has built-up their </p><p>reputations with sensational charges.  We have every </p><p>reason to believe that the Iraqi crisis can be solved </p><p>by peaceful means and insist that all parties, </p><p>including the United States and Iraq, should work </p><p>tirelessly for that outcome." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A few hours before saying `I got it\'" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Jawad Bashiti writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(02/06):  "Powell\'s evidence is aimed to convince </p><p>those who are skeptical and unsure about the crime of </p><p>the twenty-first century that the United States is </p><p>preparing to commit against the Iraqis and against </p><p>humanity.  The world has only to show the slightest </p><p>bit of confidence and belief in Powell\'s evidence to </p><p>be dragged, willingly or not, into a crime that is </p><p>exactly like the Hiroshima crime in terms of the </p><p>perpetrator, the tools, the victims and the </p><p>consequences.  The Bush administration has no other </p><p>means to convince the American people of the necessity </p><p>of this war except to scare and frighten it of the </p><p>possibility of a new terrorist attack by Al-Qa\'eda </p><p>with chemical and biological weapons supplied by </p><p>Saddam Hussein.  The Americans must be made to view </p><p>this war as a preventative measure.  Without this link </p><p>between Saddam Hussein\'s weapons and Osama bin Laden\'s </p><p>terrorism, the Bush administration would not be able </p><p>to frighten its citizens and then convince them that </p><p>war is inevitable." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A long American report" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Mohammad Kawash writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(02/06):  "The charges presented by the U.S. Secretary </p><p>of State in his long report were weak and unconvincing </p><p>to make a cover for a U.S.-launched war against Iraq. </p><p>Despite this, we believe that Secretary Powell\'s </p><p>presentation was the leader towards announcement of </p><p>imminent war on Iraq.  The United States must keep in </p><p>mind that Arab and western countries want to stop the </p><p>war and want to resolve the crisis peacefully, </p><p>diplomatically and politically." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
