<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001417 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Talks on Zimbabwe between President George W. Bush and </p><p>      his South African counterpart, Thabo Mbeki, continue to </p><p>      dominate editorials in the mainstream newspapers. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Mbeki has his job cut out" the </p><p>      independent daily "The Daily News" (07/11) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "By reassuring U. S. A. President George W. Bush and </p><p>      the whole world that Zimbabwe\'s ruling ZANU PF and </p><p>      the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) </p><p>      parties are holding talks to find a solution to the </p><p>      country\'s deepening crisis, South Africa\'s President </p><p>      Thabo Mbeki has assumed a huge responsibility. . .We </p><p>      have no reason to doubt Mbeki\'s sincerity in this </p><p>      difficult task of trying to find a solution to </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s problems.  Neither do we have cause to </p><p>      believe what several other Zimbabweans have </p><p>      suggested, that Mbeki is a `dishonest broker\' and </p><p>      that he is in it merely to try and buy more time for </p><p>      his liberation war ally President Robert Mugabe and </p><p>      his embattled government.  In fact, we would be the </p><p>      first to acknowledge that Mbeki is too intelligent a </p><p>      man not to see the futility of trying to shield a </p><p>      dictatorship in this Global Village.  And more so, </p><p>      it should be clear to all concerned, Mbeki included, </p><p>      that the problems of Zimbabwe cannot be postponed </p><p>      any further. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "U. S. President visit exposes MDC </p><p>      deceit" the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      (07/11) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The visit to South Africa this week by American </p><p>      President George W. Bush was indeed a blessing in </p><p>      disguise for Zimbabwe. . .The U-turn by the U. S. </p><p>      President was infact a slap in the face for </p><p>      opposition Movement for Democratic Change leaders </p><p>      who looked forward to Mr. Bush exerting pressure on </p><p>      Mr. Mbeki to act on Harare. . .Mr. Bush, it appears, </p><p>      is beginning to see reason, probably because of the </p><p>      meeting with Mr. Mbeki, one of the regional leaders </p><p>      directly involved in efforts to finding solutions to </p><p>      the problems facing Zimbabwe.  If Mr. Bush\'s sudden </p><p>      change of heart is a result of the fact that he now </p><p>      knows the truth about Zimbabwe, we want to believe </p><p>      his actions and utterances in the past were because </p><p>      of ignorance or misinformation. . .Now that Mr. Bush </p><p>      has confirmed for himself that some of his actions </p><p>      such as the unpopular `smart sanctions\' were based </p><p>      on half-baked truths, there is need to revisit his </p><p>      country\'s foreign policy on Zimbabwe. . .We salute </p><p>      Mr. Mbeki for remaining firm and resolute in </p><p>      defending Africa\'s independence, despite the threats </p><p>      and intimidation: </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Mbeki stands up to Bush. . .wins" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Business Tribune" (07/10) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>       "President George Bush\'s sojourn in South Africa was </p><p>       so subdued it was an anti-climax. . .What is </p><p>       encouraging about the Bush-Mbeki meeting is that </p><p>       Bush said afterwards now he supported Mbeki.  Mbeki </p><p>       had a lot of detractors of his preferred `quiet </p><p>       diplomacy\' method and Bush was the most vociferous </p><p>       of them all.  His change of stance therefore </p><p>       indicates that he sees the problem differently and </p><p>       is encouraging Mbeki to go the way he has always </p><p>       done. . .Africans ought to learn a lesson from Mbeki </p><p>       that Africa can stand up to American bully tactics </p><p>       if it remains forthright in its belief." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
