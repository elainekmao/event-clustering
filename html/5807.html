(SBU) Summary: A future GOZ may have to summon </p><p>Herculean might to resurrect the world\'s fastest </p><p>shrinking economy.  It will have to downsize its </p><p>bureaucracy, "reform" land reform, secure international </p><p>financing and devalue the Zimdollar by at least 80 </p><p>percent.  Then it will have to wean its population from </p><p>negative borrowing rates, dirt-cheap fuel and donated </p><p>food.  Worse still, the later a new GOZ gets started, the </p><p>more arduous -- and eventually, futile -- its task. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Present Quandary </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>2. (U) The Mugabe government\'s neo-Marxist approach to </p><p>economics has dug the country into an ever-deepening pit. </p><p>Since the GOZ bid farewell to fiscal policy and awarded </p><p>50,000 so-called War Veterans about US$ 2,800 each in </p><p>1997, its economic policies have become downright </p><p>surreal.  At present, fuel costs less than US$.20/gallon. </p><p>The official exchange rate is 4 percent of the market </p><p>rate.  Amateurs continue to supplant professional </p><p>farmers.  Holders of Treasury Bills earn minus 161 </p><p>percent interest while banks lend money at minus 144 </p><p>percent (using conservative official inflation rates). </p><p>Exports often carry nearly 100 percent tax-rates. And </p><p>retail prices are controlled at below-production cost on </p><p>nearly every staple. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) As a result, a small number of Zimbabweans have </p><p>gotten wealthy and the rest poor.  The country\'s GDP has </p><p>lost about 35 percent in real terms. Businesses are </p><p>closing.  There is almost no foreign investment. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Dazed Zimbabweans are only beginning to come to </p><p>grips with their impoverishment.  In an abstract way, </p><p>they blame a "shortage of foreign exchange" for high </p><p>import prices.  The real problem is, of course, </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s diminished capacity to produce value for the </p><p>world economy.  But the unsupported and fictitious </p><p>official rate, along with runaway inflation, obscures </p><p>this reality.  When a future GOZ finally recognizes the </p><p>parallel rate, most Zimbabweans -- who earn less than US$ </p><p>20/month -- will finally appreciate that their bloated </p><p>Zimdollar salaries are a smokescreen, and how little </p><p>buying power they now have in the international </p><p>marketplace.  For those who remember earning US$ 100- </p><p>150/month several years ago, this will come as a jolt. </p><p> </p><p>Managing the Transition </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) How does any government clean up this mess?  In </p><p>seeking answers, purely hypothetical at the moment, we </p><p>discussed Zimbabwe\'s economic future with local </p><p>economists, politicians, lenders and businessmen.  Most </p><p>analysts envision two enormous hurdles awaiting a reform- </p><p>minded GOZ: economic stabilization and land </p><p>redistribution.  An amalgamation of their views follows. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) First, a caveat: It will become progressively </p><p>more difficult to undo the damage.  If the economy </p><p>started growing at 4 percent annually this year, it might </p><p>take 7 years to regain 1998 prowess.  After 3 more years </p><p>of steep decline, it could take a full generation of </p><p>uninterrupted robust growth, or 2 generations of slow </p><p>growth. Zimbabwe\'s infrastructure -- education, railway, </p><p>energy, etc. -- is crumbling, but still largely intact. </p><p>This may no longer be the case after another 3 years of </p><p>the present policies.  At the same time, about 1,000 of </p><p>4,500 white farmers are still on their land in some form </p><p>(although most are not farming) and many others are </p><p>living here in limbo.  At some point, they permanently </p><p>depart the scene and a potential resource is lost. </p><p> </p><p>First Hurdle: Regain Fiscal & Monetary Control </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>7. (SBU) The GOZ would have to enact a stabilization plan </p><p>that attacks fiscal, exchange rate and monetary problems. </p><p>On the fiscal side, it could reduce ministries from 29 to </p><p>12, as the opposition Movement for Democratic Change </p><p>(MDC) proposes, with minimal drop in public service.  It </p><p>could also replace a costly fuel subsidy (about 7 percent </p><p>of GDP if demand were fully satisfied) with more targeted </p><p>support for public transport and essential services.  For </p><p>revenue, there is little room to increase already high </p><p>tax rates, but economic reinvigoration could also </p><p>eventually boost tax receipts.  The GOZ could apply </p><p>several one-time measures, such as privatization of </p><p>inefficient parastatals, as transitional revenue tools. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The GOZ\'s fiscal indiscipline has led to a </p><p>loose, print-and-spend monetary policy.  More than any </p><p>other policy, seigniorage has caused inflation in the 300- </p><p>400 percent vicinity.  When the government gradually </p><p>stops crowding out borrowing by the private sector, firms </p><p>will probably respond by increasing investment.  After a </p><p>significant and inevitable time-lag, this should propel </p><p>Zimbabwe down a sustainable growth path. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Obviously, the GOZ will need to rethink its </p><p>exchange rate regime.  A market rate that eclipses the </p><p>official rate by 25-fold has destroyed exporters. </p><p>Analysts feel that switching to a floating rate would </p><p>have minimal negative consequences, since the economy </p><p>already tacitly runs on the market rate.  International </p><p>backing and a primary (non-interest) surplus, as soon as </p><p>is manageable, could help rein in a runaway currency and </p><p>make sure a new exchange rate is sustainable. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Outside assistance would also have to cushion </p><p>the blow of escalating prices and borrowing rates.  It </p><p>would have to For the International Monetary Fund (IMF) </p><p>to consider new loans, Zimbabwe would have to clear its </p><p>unserviced debt.  Bilateral donors, such the U.S., could </p><p>offer a bridge loan (in effect, a bail-out) to cover </p><p>arrears, freeing the IMF as well as the World Bank to </p><p>consider new packages.  With arrears up to around US$ 1.7 </p><p>billion, this comes neither cheap nor risk-free but it </p><p>may be preferable to perpetual food aid. </p><p> </p><p>Second Hurdle: Rationalize Land Reform </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>11. (SBU) A new GOZ would have to revamp fast-track land </p><p>reform, although any policy change would disrupt hundred- </p><p>of-thousands of Zimbabweans with assorted interests.  We </p><p>have estimated, for example, that 300,000 - 500,000 farm </p><p>workers have lost homes/jobs while the GOZ has resettled </p><p>perhaps 150,000 new farmers (it claims 350,000). </p><p>Meanwhile, only 600 of 4,500 white commercial farmers are </p><p>still attempting to produce something (ref).  More </p><p>complicated still, politically-connected Zimbabweans who </p><p>have seized large farms will resist turning back their </p><p>bounty.  However, if a future GOZ does not address this </p><p>critical issue, it stands little chance of restoring the </p><p>agricultural sector.  New farmers are failing under the </p><p>present model.  The U.S. and other Western countries will </p><p>be more apt to provide bail-out loans or even aid to new </p><p>farmers if the GOZ resolves outstanding claims and </p><p>restores the concept of title. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) In spite of the hopes of white farmer groups, a </p><p>wing of the MDC and many ordinary Zimbabweans, it is </p><p>unlikely that a GOZ could completely undo land reform. </p><p>More probably, a new GOZ could try to return white </p><p>farmers to their houses and land if they relinquish a </p><p>portion of it and provide assistance to new farmers. </p><p>Some observers suggest the new GOZ could evict A2 </p><p>(commercial) but not A1 (small-scale) farmers, or make </p><p>new land available with better support in another area. </p><p>Other observers would like to see the GOZ make a </p><p>distinction between white farmers who own single or </p><p>multiple farms, or who acquired land before or after </p><p>independence.  Admittedly, evicting some settlers from </p><p>farmhouses and the surrounding land would be an </p><p>unpleasant, divisive and risky move -- and one not </p><p>available for long.  In another two years, new farmers </p><p>will be more physically and emotionally attached to the </p><p>land while many white farmers will no longer reside in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  At that point, the GOZ will have to live with </p><p>costly compensation claims hanging over its head. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>13. (SBU) If a GOZ successfully turns around the economy </p><p>and land reform, other benefits will follow.  No longer </p><p>punished by oppressive exchange and tax regimes, the </p><p>export sector could boom, assisted, perhaps, by </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s qualification for the African Growth and </p><p>Opportunity Act (AGOA).  While such policies could revive </p><p>agriculture, mining and manufacturing, they may open the </p><p>way for Zimbabwe to finally cash in on a potentially more </p><p>lucrative sector: tourism. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) But this is the rosiest outcome.  It is </p><p>possible that a ZANU-PF government will follow the same </p><p>policy drift for several more years or even expand forced </p><p>indigenization to industry or residential housing.  When </p><p>the dust settles, Zimbabwe will be an economic basket- </p><p>case, a shell of its former self.  Even if a reform- </p><p>minded government comes to power, it is far from certain </p><p>that new leaders will have the political will and skill </p><p>to guide the population through the bruising and </p><p>tumultuous transition period we describe above.  In any </p><p>event, we believe the U.S. should be ready to assist if a </p><p>post-Mugabe GOZ braves this thorny path. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
