<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 003623 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, NEA/ARP, DRL, INR/NESA, INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MASS, PTER, EFIN, EAID, KDEM, PHUM, PINR, KU, OVIP (SABAH SABAH AL-AHMED AL-JABER AL-) </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) SHAYKH SABAH\'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 3358 </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 3316 </p><p>     C. KUWAIT 3589 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON: 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) INTRODUCTION:  This message is intended to assist </p><p>preparations for Prime Minister Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmed </p><p>al-Jaber al-Sabah\'s visit to Washington, where he is due to </p><p>meet with President Bush on September 10.  We recommend that </p><p>he be invited to meet (separately) with the Secretaries of </p><p>State, Defense, Treasury, and Commerce. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CONGRATULATIONS...:  Every meeting with Shaykh Sabah </p><p>should begin with congratulations on his elevation to Prime </p><p>Minister in July, which strengthened his ability to run the </p><p>government and explicitly enhanced his personal prestige (he </p><p>is now addressed as "Highness" rather than "Excellency"; </p><p>previously, only the Amir and Crown Prince merited that </p><p>honorific).  In his mid-seventies and fitted with a </p><p>pacemaker, Shaykh Sabah is nonetheless far more energetic and </p><p>mentally alert than his brother the Amir, let alone the Crown </p><p>Prince.  Always smiling, he speaks passable English but </p><p>sometimes prefers to use an interpreter in official meetings. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ...AND THANKS:  Shaykh Sabah will welcome sincere </p><p>thanks for Kuwait\'s extraordinary support to Operation Iraqi </p><p>Freedom.  Indeed, as we have reported previously, Kuwait was </p><p>the one absolutely indispensable ally, providing the main </p><p>platform for the ground campaign (and a good portion of the </p><p>air strikes) and giving its all to facilitate our activities: </p><p> the GOK closed more than half the country\'s territory to </p><p>civilians in order to accommodate our troop buildup, allowed </p><p>us to take over a major seaport and much of the only </p><p>international airport, gave us extensive use of all three of </p><p>its military airbases, and contributed hundreds of millions </p><p>of dollars\' worth of Assistance-In-Kind, including unlimited </p><p>fuel for US forces operating through or from Kuwait. </p><p>Kuwait\'s government and people were unique in the Arab world </p><p>for their forthright united support of OIF.  The GOK has also </p><p>been a key partner in OEF and has gone to the very limit of </p><p>its resources to ensure the security of Americans in Kuwait, </p><p>especially since the October 2002 terrorist attack on Failaka </p><p>island in which a US Marine was killed. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) R-E-S-P-E-C-T:  The intense cooperation between </p><p>Kuwait and the US in the buildup to and execution of OIF was </p><p>almost bound to be followed by an anti-climax.  The Kuwaitis </p><p>now feel underappreciated, taken for granted.  Two main </p><p>reasons:  disappointment that President Bush did not visit </p><p>here while in the Gulf region, and unfulfilled (unrealistic) </p><p>expectations of being handed lucrative contracts for Iraqi </p><p>reconstruction.  The most important message Shaykh Sabah will </p><p>be looking for is assurance that we remain committed to the </p><p>strategic partnership with Kuwait and that we value it as a </p><p>more than a cash cow for funding international commitments or </p><p>as a regional parking lot for military forces. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) A STRATEGIC PARTNER:  The next most important message </p><p>he will be looking for is that we will stay the course in </p><p>Iraq, even if the price is high in blood and treasure.  The </p><p>Kuwaitis know they are strategically bound to us; they want </p><p>us to be seen as steadfast masters of events.  This small </p><p>country\'s most strategic value for us is its location and its </p><p>willingness to place itself at our disposal in defense of </p><p>regional stability and in the Global War On Terrorism.  At </p><p>the same time, now that Saddam\'s regime is gone, Kuwait hopes </p><p>for a peace dividend.  It will want to maintain a robust </p><p>mil-mil relationship with us, but it will be less willing to </p><p>spend as much in support of an enduring large US military </p><p>presence.  We are working to arrange a visit to Washington by </p><p>Defense Minister Shaykh Jaber Mubarak in early CY 2004 to </p><p>coincide with the first US-Kuwait Joint Military Commission </p><p>meeting since 1999. The Defense Review Group, a joint process </p><p>lasting several months starting in September, will assess </p><p>Kuwait\'s military needs in light of the new reality in the </p><p>region and help set the stage for the JMC. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The GOK has cooperated actively against terrorist </p><p>financing.  Although there have been no direct hits, some </p><p>asset freezes have hit uncomfortably close to home.  Foreign </p><p>branches of two Islamic charities of international scope </p><p>based here have been subject to freeze orders.  We have an </p><p>interest in strengthening the GOK\'s -- and the major </p><p>charities\' -- capacity to exert strict control over funds, to </p><p>ensure they are not diverted to terrorist or other criminal </p><p>ends.  So far the GOK has been good on this issue, despite </p><p>occasional sharp criticism from Islamists, but progress has </p><p>not been rapid. </p><p> </p><p>(U) REFORM </p><p>---------- </p><p>7.  (C) It is reasonable to assume (a) that Shaykh Sabah will </p><p>try to gauge how hard we intend to push his Government to </p><p>enact political, educational and economic reforms, and (b) </p><p>that he we will argue that we not push destabilizingly hard. </p><p>After all, Kuwait is a prosperous country with a basically </p><p>contented citizenry; it ranked first in the UNDP\'s Arab Human </p><p>Development Report.  In Washington, Shaykh Sabah may decide </p><p>to take the initiative and present himself as a reformer. </p><p>This would be out of keeping with his longstanding </p><p>personality, but then, he has never before wielded so much </p><p>authority.  So far it looks like he is treating (or at least </p><p>portraying) his elevation to Prime Minister -- which pundits </p><p>had openly called for, due to the Crown Prince\'s incapacity </p><p>-- as a mandate from the Amir to enact long-overdue economic </p><p>reforms.  Indeed, with Shaykh Sabah\'s blessing, Minister of </p><p>Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah </p><p>has organized a high-level interagency working group for </p><p>economic reform predicated on a heavy Kuwaiti participation </p><p>in Iraqi reconstruction (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Shaykh Sabah announced before the July National </p><p>Assembly elections that he would work with the new Assembly </p><p>to extend political rights to women.  If he does present </p><p>himself as a reformer, the Prime Minister may emphasize that </p><p>overt US advocacy in this area would be counter-productive. </p><p>There is more than a grain of truth to this:  last December, </p><p>the then-Minister of Education tried to reform the school </p><p>curricula and met a torrent of resistance from Islamists in </p><p>parliament who sought to discredit his initiative as a US </p><p>imposition (even though we had no direct involvement). </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMERCIAL ISSUES:  As noted ref A, we have won </p><p>several contracts for American companies recently, and US </p><p>firms are well positioned to be big players in the </p><p>development of Kuwait\'s northern oil fields, though the terms </p><p>offered thus far need improvement.  Fulfillment of the Amir\'s </p><p>1996 commitment on the long-delayed Al-Zour North power </p><p>project remains elusive as it finally appears poised to move </p><p>to tendering.  Secretary of Commerce Evans recently wrote the </p><p>Prime Minister asking for reaffirmation of this commitment. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) POTENTIAL IRRITANTS:  Now that the unifying threat of </p><p>Saddam is gone, Kuwaitis are turning to domestic issues and </p><p>losing some of their sense of needing to accommodate the </p><p>United States as the ultimate guarantor of their country\'s </p><p>security.  This frees them to notice and speak up about </p><p>perceived slights or irritants in the relationship, and there </p><p>are some: </p><p> </p><p>- Guantanamo:  The detention of twelve Kuwaitis at Guantanamo </p><p>is an issue that periodically nags at the relationship </p><p>(inevitably, as time passes with no indication of movement </p><p>towards disposing of their cases one way or another).  We </p><p>should expect that Shaykh Sabah will make passing reference </p><p>to it.  Recently, after several Islamists picked up the issue </p><p>again, the President of the National Assembly dutifully made </p><p>a strong public statement against their continued detention </p><p>without due process, and Foreign Minister Shaykh Dr. Mohammed </p><p>al-Sabah expressed the Government\'s agreement with his view, </p><p>albeit it considerably milder terms.  A proposed visit by an </p><p>MOI delegation to Guantanamo could help take some steam out </p><p>of the issue, particularly if it were seen as a result of </p><p>Shaykh Sabah\'s visit. </p><p> </p><p>- Mogas:  The GOK\'s belief that KBR (on behalf of the CPA, </p><p>and under the direction of the US Army Corps of Engineers) is </p><p>increasingly buying mogas from Turkey instead of Kuwait (ref </p><p>C), feeds the Kuwaitis\' sense of being ill-rewarded for being </p><p>a steadfast ally.  A promise to continue buying fuel </p><p>(including LPG) from Kuwait as long as foreign purchases by </p><p>ACE/KBR are necessary would help salve their wounds. </p><p> </p><p>- Missing Persons:  Significant progress is being made in the </p><p>search for the remains of Kuwaitis missing since the Iraqi </p><p>occupation, and there is strong cooperation between the GOK </p><p>and the Coalition.  Even so, the issue of the missing is a </p><p>deeply emotional one here, and some Kuwaitis feel that we did </p><p>not do enough to find their kin immediately following </p><p>liberation. </p><p> </p><p>- UN Compensation Commission:  The GOK understands that we </p><p>played a constructive role in safeguarding in UNSCR 1483 the </p><p>principle of Iraq\'s obligation to pay compensation, but it </p><p>felt let down when we departed from agreed language and </p><p>substituted new text at the last minute that, it fears, </p><p>copuld make it easier to eliminate compensation in the </p><p>future.  Given the huge volume of outstanding claims, </p><p>including from private citizens and companies, this has the </p><p>potential to become a huge negative.  Assurances that it will </p><p>not would be music to Shaykh Sabah\'s ears. </p><p> </p><p>- TIP:  The Secretary got the GOK\'s attention when he raised </p><p>Trafficking In Persons with then-Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs (now Foreign Minister) Shaykh Dr. Mohammed </p><p>Sabah in April.  Kuwait was ranked in Tier 2 this year, but </p><p>will need sustained progress to stay off Tier 3 next year. </p><p>The GOK\'s acute sensitivity to its international reputation </p><p>will motivate it to address concerns that it considers valid, </p><p>but prevailing attitudes towards foreign laborers -- </p><p>especially domestic servants -- make for some big blind </p><p>spots; as a result, Kuwaitis are not always prepared to </p><p>acknowledge that they have a problem.  Shaykh Sabah should </p><p>hear directly how important an issue this is for the US.  The </p><p>best step would be to extend the Labor Law to cover </p><p>domestics. </p><p> </p><p>- Visas:  This is actually two issues; both have been </p><p>manageable thus far: </p><p> </p><p>-- Getting a US visa has become a much less pleasant </p><p>experience for Kuwaitis than it used to be, alienating some </p><p>who would otherwise choose to travel to the US for study, </p><p>business or tourism. </p><p> </p><p>-- Since the start of OIF, a flood of Americans -- and others </p><p>traveling under our auspices, including Iraqis -- into and </p><p>out of Kuwait, all too often without proper documentation, or </p><p>without proper entry/exit formalities.  The GOK has been very </p><p>flexible, but has nonetheless suffered snide criticism in the </p><p>US media for attempting to reassert sovereign control over </p><p>its borders -- something we continually ask it to ensure, for </p><p>our own safety. </p><p> </p><p>- Terrorist Financing:  The GOK has cooperated fully in </p><p>asset-freezes including some involving foreign branches of </p><p>Kuwait-based Islamic charities that are considered reputable </p><p>here, without seeing evidence that it would consider </p><p>compelling.  It has also taken steps to get better control of </p><p>local fundraising activities.  This has exposed the </p><p>Government to complaints that it is blindly abetting Western </p><p>hostility towards Islam. </p><p> </p><p>- IPR:  This is our nickel.  Shaykh Sabah should be politely </p><p>warned that barring significant progress in enforcing </p><p>intellectual property rights, Kuwait is headed for elevation </p><p>to the Special 301 Priority Watch List.  The copyright law </p><p>needs revision and more needs to be done to run street </p><p>vendors of pirated electronic media out of business. </p><p>Penalities for piracy must be strengthened dramatically and </p><p>enforcement needs to move from the Ministry of Information to </p><p>the Ministry of Interior. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
