<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001471 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION DROC; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "DRC rebel ministers irresponsible" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its </p><p>      July 20 editorial to urging leaders from the Democratic </p><p>      Republic of Congo\'s (DRC) two main rebel movements "to act </p><p>      responsibly and in the interests of their long-suffering </p><p>      people."  The editorial comes immediately after the cabinet </p><p>      ministers had boycotted a swearing-in ceremony last Friday </p><p>      in protest against President Joseph Kabila\'s appointment as </p><p>      head of the transitional government.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .As we see it, the argument by the rebel </p><p>      ministers lacks merit and serves to complicate an already </p><p>      precarious peace deal that presents the best possible </p><p>      chance of achieving peace in the war-torn central African </p><p>      country.  It profits little for the rebel ministers to </p><p>      insist on academic arguments that serve as a stumbling </p><p>      block to the realization of peace in their country. </p><p>      African leaders, as well as the international community, </p><p>      have invested a great deal into assisting the Congolese to </p><p>      map out a viable way forward out of the deplorable </p><p>      situation. . .It is, therefore, naive and </p><p>      retrogressive for any one of the key parties to the </p><p>      Congolese conflict to seek to undo the sterling work </p><p>      achieved.  The sooner the Congolese road map is set </p><p>      in motion, the better. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
