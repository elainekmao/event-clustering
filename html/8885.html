(S) ECMIN DREW DE MOHR\'S ATTENTION TO WASHINGTON\'S </p><p>CONTINUED CONCERN THAT THE GOI PROVIDE WRITTEN ASSURANCES TO </p><p>THE U.S. THAT ALENIA SPAZIO HAD TERMINATED COMPLETELY THE TWO </p><p>SATELLITE STUDIES FOR CHINA.

C) HAD BEEN DRAFTED AND WAS READY FOR DG MAGLIANO\'S </p><p>SIGNATURE, EXPECTED EARLY NEXT WEEK.

DE MOHR RESPONDED THAT THE MAKEUP OF </p><p>THE ITALIAN DELEGATION WOULD BE INFLUENCED BY THE COMPOSITION </p><p>OF THE U.S. DELEGATION.
