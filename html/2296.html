<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 003200 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/13/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ARMY MINISTER OF STATE ON BENUE: </p><p>UPCOMING VISIT TO WASHINGTON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: PARK-BROWNE E-MAILS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Minister of State for Army Lawal Batagarawa </p><p>departed Nigeria on </p><p>December 8 on his way to Washington to explain  developments </p><p>in Benue and </p><p>neighboring states.  In Washington, Batagarawa told us that </p><p>the Nigerian </p><p>Embassy has arranged several meetings on the Hill beginning </p><p>December 10. </p><p>Batagarawa will be in Washington until o/a December 18. </p><p>During that time, he </p><p>would like meetings in the Department (AF, DRL) and at the </p><p>NSC. The following </p><p>information is to give Washington interlocutors a preview of </p><p>what Batagarawa </p><p>will likely say. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During our conversations with Batagarawa, he </p><p>emphasized that the </p><p>Tiv-Jukun rivalry, which is at the heart of the chaos in </p><p>Benue and unrest in </p><p>adjacent areas of Nasarawa and Taraba, is a long standing </p><p>one.  Violence </p><p>between the two groups goes back many years.  The cause of </p><p>the feud is </p><p>competition for arable land accentuated by Tiv expansionism. </p><p>Both groups are </p><p>agrarian. However, the hard-working Tiv have a much higher </p><p>population growth </p><p>rate; they keep grabbing new land to accommodate their </p><p>numbers.  They are known </p><p>to move to greener fields after farming a parcel until soil </p><p>fertility is </p><p>exhausted.  Tivs also are insular socially and culturally. </p><p>Jukun and other </p><p>ethnic groups feel severely threatened because the Tiv have </p><p>expanded into lands </p><p>formerly not theirs.  This expansion would cause problems by </p><p>itself but is </p><p>further compounded by the alleged Tiv propensity to dominate </p><p>and eventually </p><p>expropriate new areas into which they move. Tension exists </p><p>wherever a Tiv </p><p>presence abuts another ethnic community. Because of their </p><p>appetite for land and control, the Tiv are generally disliked </p><p>by their neighbors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The perceived Tiv encroachment has larger political </p><p>ramifications under </p><p>democratic governance than under military rule. Control of </p><p>land often begets </p><p>control of local government administration, i.e., budgets and </p><p>other significant </p><p>resources. Both Tiv and Jukun have been well represented in </p><p>the military (the </p><p>Tiv more so), meaning there are numbers of retired soldiers </p><p>and available </p><p>weapons in the Benue-Taraba-Nasarawa border region.  Both </p><p>sides can count </p><p>relatively well trained people in their informal militias. </p><p>Given the longevity </p><p>and violent nature of this feud, the military was faced with </p><p>a difficult task </p><p>when deployed to halt the ethnic clashes, Batagarawa will </p><p>admit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Batagarawa and other GON officials perceive the </p><p>outside world as </p><p>focussing primarily on the military\'s attacks against the </p><p>civilians and paying </p><p>little, if any, attention to the gruesome murders of the 19 </p><p>soldiers. </p><p>Nevertheless, he will refute any suggestion that reprisal </p><p>attacks against </p><p>civilians were ordered by senior GON officials, particularly </p><p>the President.  He </p><p>will state that the situation in Benue is complex -- all of </p><p>the damage after </p><p>the 19 soldiers were killed cannot be laid at the feet of the </p><p>military.  He </p><p>attributes some of the damage and mayhem to Jukun </p><p>counter-attacks. The Minister </p><p>will blame the media for sensationalized reporting that </p><p>brands the military as </p><p>the sole culprit.  Some Tiv politicians have willfully </p><p>abetted the skewed media </p><p>coverage.  These Tiv have been angry at the Obasanjo regime, </p><p>he will say. </p><p>Obasanjo has dismissed many Tiv officers from the military, </p><p>including Chief of </p><p>Staff Victor Malu after he publicly defied the President\'s </p><p>authority.  Obasanjo </p><p>had also deflected Tiv entreaties for more senior-level GON </p><p>positions.   Some Tiv also blame Obasanjo </p><p>for the sacking of their ethnic brother, recently ousted PDP </p><p>chairman Barnabas </p><p>Gemade, in favor of an ethnic Idoma from Benue State, Audu </p><p>Ogbeh.  While </p><p>moderate Tiv want to calm tensions, hard-line elements want </p><p>Obasanjo to pay a </p><p>political price for what they see as an estranged </p><p>relationship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Batagarawa will state that resolution of problems in </p><p>Benue requires a </p><p>dual track approach. First, the GON must quell the violence. </p><p>Reports indicate </p><p>small-scale confrontations still occurring in some isolated </p><p>areas, and that </p><p>several people have been killed recently.  The situation will </p><p>require continued </p><p>military deployment for the near future.  Thus, the </p><p>government is wary of </p><p>taking any action undermining the morale or mandate of the </p><p>deployed troops. </p><p>While not trying to absolve guilty soldiers of blame for the </p><p>violence they </p><p>committed, Batagarawa will assert that investigating the </p><p>reprisals will take </p><p>time and must be done in a way that does not re-ignite armed </p><p>hostilities. </p><p>Although the army was not responsible for all of the reprisal </p><p>violence, a govern </p><p>ment statement indicating that Jukun were partially culpable </p><p>may inspire </p><p>militant Tiv to exact revenge. This is something the GON will </p><p>work to avoid. </p><p>Nevertheless, Batagarawa will state that the GON is committed </p><p>to identifying </p><p>and punishing guilty soldiers and civilians.  But again, the </p><p>government will proceed in a manner that does </p><p>not foment additional unrest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Second, the GON must seek long-term solutions to the </p><p>crisis.  Long-term </p><p>solutions involve convincing the Tiv to change land use </p><p>methods and to eschew </p><p>ethnic chauvinism.  The Taraba Deputy Governor also told the </p><p>Ambassador a few </p><p>days ago that local non-Tiv groups will never allow Tivs to </p><p>be a part of their </p><p>traditional and/or political institutions.  The GON must </p><p>convince the Jukun and </p><p>others to accept the  Tiv presence and to accept the ethnic </p><p>dynamics of </p><p>migration in their specific rural setting.  However, neither </p><p>side will </p><p>compromise and work toward these goals if they have been </p><p>publicly fustigated by </p><p>the GON as being the bad guy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7 (C) Comment. The GON is edgy and defensive about Benue. </p><p>Trying to boost its </p><p>international image by amassing a commendable peacekeeping </p><p>record abroad, the </p><p>GON does not want this goal dashed by the military developing </p><p>a sullied </p><p>reputation for "peacekeeping" at home. Also, there is a </p><p>genuine sense of regret </p><p>in the GON for the loss of innocent lives in Benue. In their </p><p>own way, the </p><p>Nigerians will try to address human right concerns.  There is </p><p>a historical </p><p>association between outbreaks of violence in Tiv-land and the </p><p>later onset of </p><p>larger-scale threats to national security and national </p><p>integrity.  Hence, the </p><p>relative weight the GON attaches to human rights </p><p>considerations in this matter </p><p>differs significantly from ours.  Moreover, there has not </p><p>been a loud hue and </p><p>cry raised within Nigeria over the reprisals against the </p><p>Tivs.  Due to the </p><p>macabre execution and gruesome mutilation of the 19 soldiers </p><p>and partly due to </p><p>the general animus toward the Tivs, many Nigerians believe, </p><p>however wrongfully, </p><p>that the Tiv got their due. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment cont. For Batagarawa and the GON, the bottom </p><p>line is internal </p><p>security.  Because its soldiers constitute the last line of </p><p>defense against </p><p>widespread unrest, protecting the army as an institution from </p><p>serious domestic </p><p>fall-out will be a compelling GON imperative. This does not </p><p>mean the GON will </p><p>not punish miscreants; but it will proceed in a manner that </p><p>neither causes </p><p>rupture in the army nor sparks ethnic conflict. Judging by </p><p>what Batagarawa and </p><p>others have said, any investigative or judicial proceeding </p><p>will be tempered by </p><p>political considerations. Nevertheless, Batagarawa\'s visit </p><p>provides an </p><p>opportunity to underscore our concerns about Benue and the </p><p>need for an </p><p>impartial investigation there. The underlying message is that </p><p>promoting the </p><p>rule of law and human rights, at a moment when these ideas </p><p>are right but </p><p>politically awkward, is a sign of true commitment. Meeting </p><p>Batagarawa also </p><p>demonstrates that our minds are open and that we want to give </p><p>the GON a fair </p><p>hearing on the allegations of military brutality.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
