<p>UNCLAS STATE 391887 </p><p> </p><p>FOR POLITICAL OFFICERS, INFO PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:   N/A </p><p>TAGS:         PTER, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:      DOCUMENTS ON SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A FACT PAPER ON SYRIAN </p><p>SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM AND A CHRONOLOGY OF SELECTED </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENTS BY SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS.  EARLIER </p><p>VERSIONS OF BOTH DOCUMENTS WERE RELEASED TO THE PRESS ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 14 AND APPEARED IN THE USIA WIRELESS FILE ON </p><p>THAT DATE.  BOTH DOCUMENTS HAVE NOW BEEN REVISED TO </p><p>REFLECT THE HASI CONVICTION IN WEST BERLIN ON NOVEMBER </p><p>26.  WE ASSUME USIS MADE APPROPRIATE USE OF THE MATERIAL </p><p>APPEARING IN THE WIRELESS FILE.  WE ARE SENDING THE </p><p>REVISED VERSIONS SO THAT POLOFFS MAY SHARE THE </p><p>INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THESE DOCUMENTS WITH HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (BEGIN TEXT OF FACT PAPER) </p><p> </p><p>DECEMBER 5, 1986 </p><p> </p><p>SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM:  1983-1986 </p><p> </p><p>NEW EVIDENCE OF SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR AND DIRECT INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN </p><p>TWO RECENT TRIALS INCLUDING THE CONVICTION IN GREAT </p><p>BRITAIN OF NIZAR HINDAWI FOR THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING OF AN </p><p>EL AL CIVILIAN AIRPLANE WITH 375 PASSENGERS ABOARD. </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA CLEARLY HAS A LONG RECORD OF INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>TERRORISM.  SYRIA IS ONE OF THE "CHARTER MEMBERS" OF </p><p>COUNTRIES ON THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S TERRORISM LIST, WHICH </p><p>WAS FIRST COMPILED IN 1979.  (COUNTRIES CURRENTLY ON THE </p><p>LIST ARE SYRIA, LIBYA, IRAN, SOUTH YEMEN, AND CUBA.) </p><p> </p><p>THE PATTERN OF SYRIAN ACTIVITY IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM </p><p>HAS VARIED.  FROM THE MID-1970\'S THROUGH 1983, SYRIAN </p><p>PERSONNEL ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN </p><p>TERRORIST OPERATIONS.  THESE OPERATIONS WERE PRIMARILY </p><p>DIRECTED AGAINST OTHER ARABS, SUCH AS SYRIAN DISSIDENTS, </p><p>MODERATE ARAB STATES SUCH AS JORDAN, AND PRO-ARAFAT </p><p>PALESTINIANS, AS WELL AS ISRAELI AND JEWISH TARGETS.  IN </p><p>1982, FOR EXAMPLE, A CAR BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE </p><p>OFFICES OF A LEBANESE-OWNED PRO-IRAQI NEWSPAPER IN </p><p>DOWNTOWN PARIS, KILLING ONE PERSON AND INJURING SCORES OF </p><p>OTHERS.  FRANCE LATER EXPELLED TWO SYRIAN DIPLOMATS AND </p><p>ORDERED ITS AMBASSADOR HOME FOR CONSULTATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>BY LATE 1983 DAMASCUS HAD CURTAILED USE OF ITS OWN </p><p>PERSONNEL.  INSTEAD, IT BEGAN TO RELY MORE HEAVILY ON </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS MADE UP OF NON-SYRIANS WHO HAVE BASES </p><p>AND TRAINING FACILITIES IN SYRIA AND SYRIAN-OCCUPIED </p><p>AREAS OF LEBANON.  THE MOST NOTORIOUS OF THESE IS THE ABU </p><p>NIDAL ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT SYRIA PREFERS TO </p><p>SUPPORT GROUPS WHOSE ACTIVITIES ARE GENERALLY IN LINE </p><p>WITH SYRIAN OBJECTIVES, RATHER THAN TO SELECT TARGETS OR </p><p>CONTROL OPERATIONS ITSELF.  DAMASCUS UTILIZES THESE </p><p>GROUPS TO ATTACK OR INTIMIDATE ENEMIES AND OPPONENTS AND </p><p>TO EXERT ITS INFLUENCE IN THE REGION.  YET AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME IT CAN DISAVOW KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR OPERATIONS.  SUCH </p><p>SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS HAVE CARRIED OUT SCORES OF </p><p>ATTACKS AGAINST PALESTINIAN AND OTHER ARAB, TURKISH, </p><p>ISRAELI AND WESTERN TARGETS DURING THE PAST THREE </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>THIS YEAR, INVESTIGATIONS INTO MAJOR INCIDENTS HAVE </p><p>REVEALED ANOTHER CHANGE IN SYRIAN ACTIVITIES:  THAT SYRIA </p><p>HAS NOT ABANDONED ITS WILLINGNESS TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED </p><p>IN TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE BRITISH TRIAL AND </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF THE ABORTIVE EL AL BOMBING EXPOSED THE </p><p>DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF PRESIDENT ASSAD\'S INTELLIGENCE </p><p>SERVICES.  AND THE WEST BERLIN TRIAL INTO THE BOMBING OF </p><p>THE GERMAN-ARAB FRIENDSHIP UNION IN WEST BERLIN REVEAED </p><p>THE INVOLVEMENT OF SYRIAN OFFICIALS.  TO A LARGE DEGREE, </p><p>SYRIA HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN COVERING ITS TRACKS.  NOW, </p><p>HOWEVER, IN BRITAIN AND BERLIN, EVIDENCE OF MORE DIRECT </p><p>SYRIAN INVOLVEMENT HAS EMERGED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON AND BERLIN INVESTIGATIONS </p><p> </p><p>IN THE BRITISH INVESTIGATION OF THE ABORTED EL AL ATTACK, </p><p>HINDAWI TOLD BRITISH POLICE HE WAS RECRUITED BY HAITHAM </p><p>SAID, AN AIDE TO MAJOR GENERAL AL-KHULI, CHIEF OF SYRIAN </p><p>AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE.  ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE </p><p>PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL, AL-KHULI\'S OPERATIVES: (1) </p><p>SUPPLIED HINDAWI, A JORDANIAN, WITH A SYRIAN PASSPORT; </p><p>(2) GAVE HIM DOLLARS 12,000 AND PROMISED HIM MORE MONEY </p><p>WHEN HE COMPLETED HIS MISSION TO PLANT A BOMB ABOARD AN </p><p>EL AL CIVILIAN AIRLINER; (3) PROVIDED HIM WITH THE BOMB </p><p>WHICH WAS CARRIED INTO LONDON ABOARD THE SYRIAN ARAB </p><p>AIRLINES, WHICH ALSO GAVE HIM SAA CREW MEMBER HOTEL </p><p>ACCOMMODATIONS; AND (4) TRAINED HIM IN THE BOMB\'S USE. </p><p> </p><p>HINDAWI TRIED TO USE HIS PREGNANT GIRL FRIEND AS THE </p><p>UNWITTING CARRIER OF THE SOPHISTICATED BOMB WHICH WAS </p><p>BUILT INTO HER CARRY-ON BAG.  IF AN ALERT SECURITY </p><p>OFFICIAL HAD NOT SPOTTED THE DEVICE AFTER HER BAG CLEARED </p><p>AN EARLIER CHECK, 375 INNOCENT PERSONS, INCLUDING SOME </p><p>230 AMERICANS, WOULD HAVE PERISHED. </p><p> </p><p>AFTER THE APRIL 17 PLAN FAILED, ACCORDING TO EVIDENCE </p><p>PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL, HINDAWI FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS TO </p><p>GO TO THE SYRIAN EMBASSY, WHERE HE WAS GREETED BY THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND HIDDEN IN A SYRIAN SAFEHOUSE IN LONDON. </p><p>BRITISH PRESS REPORTS OF THE INVESTIGATION SAY BRITAIN </p><p>ALSO HAS EVIDENCE THAT THE SYRIAN AMBASSADOR IN LONDON </p><p>WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THE </p><p>ATTEMPTED BOMBING IN RECRUITING HINDAWI FOR SYRIAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE. </p><p> </p><p>IN WEST BERLIN, HINDAWI\'S BROTHER, AHMAD HASI, AND </p><p>ANOTHER ARAB, FAROUK SALAMEH, WERE CONVICTED FOR THE </p><p>MARCH 29 BOMBING OF THE GERMAN-ARAB FRIENDSHIP UNION IN </p><p>WEST BERLIN IN WHICH ELEVEN PERSONS WERE INJURED.  IN A </p><p>SWORN STATEMENT, HASI SAID HE PICKED UP THIS BOMB AT THE </p><p>SYRIAN EMBASSY IN EAST BERLIN FROM A SENIOR SYRIAN AIR </p><p>FORCE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, HAITHEM SAEED, AND A SYRIAN </p><p>EXPLOSIVES EXPERT WAS SENT FROM DAMASCUS TO REPAIR THE </p><p>DEVICE AFTER IT TWICE FAILED TO EXPLODE. </p><p> </p><p>ABU NIDAL </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE MOST ACTIVE AND BRUTAL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUP OPERATING TODAY, ABU NIDAL. </p><p>(SEE NOTE BELOW)  ALTHOUGH ABU NIDAL NOW ALSO RECEIVES </p><p>BACKING AND SUPPORT FROM LIBYA, AND SANCTUARY IN EASTERN </p><p>EUROPE, DAMASCUS HAS PROVIDED ABU NIDAL WITH IMPORTANT </p><p>LOGISTICAL SUPPORT EVER SINCE THE GROUP MOVED FROM IRAQ </p><p>IN 1983.  SYRIA ALLOWS ABU NIDAL\'S GROUP TO MAINTAIN </p><p>TRAINING CAMPS IN THE LEBANESE BIQA\' VALLEY, AN AREA </p><p>UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE SYRIAN ARMED FORCES.  SYRIA </p><p>PROVIDES THE GROUP WITH TRAVEL DOCUMENTS AND PERMITS ITS </p><p>OPERATIVES TO TRANSIT FREELY THROUGH DAMASCUS WHEN </p><p>DEPARTING ON MISSIONS.  SYRIA CONTINUES TO PERMIT </p><p>OPERATION OF ABU NIDAL FACILITIES IN DAMASCUS.  (THE </p><p>SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ASSERTS THAT THE SOLE FUNCTION OF THESE </p><p>FACILITIES IS LIMITED TO CULTURAL AND POLITICAL AFFAIRS.) </p><p> </p><p>ALTHOUGH LAST DECEMBER\'S ROME AIRPORT ATTACK WAS </p><p>COMMITTED UNDER LIBYAN SPONSORSHIP, THE SURVIVING MEMBER </p><p>OF THE FOUR-MAN TERRORIST TEAM, ACCORDING TO REPORTS ON </p><p>THE ITALIAN INVESTIGATION, TOLD INVESTIGATORS THE TEAM </p><p>WAS TRAINED IN SYRIAN-OCCUPIED AREAS OF LEBANON BY </p><p>SYRIANS.  THE TEAM THEN TRAVELED TO DAMASCUS, WHERE IT </p><p>REMAINED WHILE FINAL PREPARATIONS WERE MADE FOR THE </p><p>ATTACK IN WHICH 16 CIVILIANS AND 3 TERRORISTS WERE </p><p>KILLED. </p><p> </p><p>IN ANKARA ON NOVEMBER 6, TURKISH PROSECUTERS ISSUED AN </p><p>INDICTMENT ACCUSING SIX PALESTINIANS WORKING FOR THE ABU </p><p>NIDAL ORGANIZATION OF KILLING A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT IN </p><p>JULY, 1985.  THE INDICTMENT ALSO LINKED THE MEN WITH FOUR </p><p>OTHER ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE SEPTEMBER 6, 1986 ATTACK ON </p><p>AN ISTANBUL SYNAGOGUE, KILLING 21 PERSONS AND A 1983 </p><p>ATTEMPT TO PLACE A BOMB ON AN ALITALIA FLIGHT, AND THE </p><p>ATTEMPTED CAR BOMBING OF A U.S. OFFICERS CLUB IN IZMIR IN </p><p>1983. </p><p> </p><p>(BEGIN NOTE)  THE OFFICIAL NAME OF THE ABU NIDAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION IS "FATAH - REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL."  IT IS </p><p>HEADED BY SABRI AL-BANNA, A PALESTINIAN WHO USES THE NOM </p><p>DE GUERRE ABU NIDAL.  THE GROUP\'S ORIGINAL NAME WAS THE </p><p>BLACK JUNE ORGANIZATION WHEN IT WAS FORMED IN 1976. </p><p>IRONICALLY, THIS GROUP FIRST CONCENTRATED ON SYRIAN </p><p>TARGETS, INCLUDING AN ATTACK ON SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>KHADDAM, NOW VICE PRESIDENT, IN 1977.  (END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION\'S MOVE TO SYRIA IN 1983 WAS </p><p>FOLLOWED BY A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE GROUP\'S TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS:  MORE THAN A DOZEN ATTACKS IN 1984 AND TWICE </p><p>THAT NUMBER IN 1985.  MORE THAN HALF OF THE 1985 ATTACKS </p><p>OCCURRED IN WESTERN EUROPE, INCLUDING ATTACKS ON BRITISH </p><p>TOURISTS AT HOTELS IN ATHENS.   WHEN KING HUSSEIN </p><p>LAUNCHED HIS FEBRUARY 1985 PEACE INITIATIVE, JORDAN </p><p>BECAME A MAJOR TARGET.  BUT WHEN JORDANIAN-SYRIAN </p><p>RELATIONS BEGAN TO WARM IN MID-1985, ATTACKS ON </p><p>JORDANIANS AT HOME AND ABROAD DIMINISHED. </p><p> </p><p>IN ITS DEALINGS WITH WESTERN COUNTRIES, SYRIA HAS </p><p>CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO PLAY DOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS </p><p>CONNECTION WITH ABU NIDAL AND HAS DENIED PERMITTING HIS </p><p>GROUP TO ENGAGE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  HOWEVER, THERE IS </p><p>NO EVIDENCE THAT DAMASCUS HAS ACTUALLY RESTRAINED ABU </p><p>NIDAL\'S ACTIVITIES (ABU NIDAL TRAINING CAMPS IN THE </p><p>SYRIAN-CONTROLLED BIQA\' VALLEY CONTINUE TO OPERATE FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE) OR CUT BACK ON OTHER FORMS OF SUPPORT.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>IT MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT EVERY OPERATION, GIVEN THE AMOUNT </p><p>AND NATURE OF SYRIAN SUPPORT, DAMASCUS COULD INFLUENCE </p><p>AND CONSTRAIN THE ABU NIDAL GROUP\'S ACTIVITIES IN SYRIA </p><p>AND SYRIAN-CONTROLLED AREAS OF LEBANON IF IT CHOSE TO DO </p><p>SO. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER SYRIAN-SUPPORTED PALESTINIAN GROUPS </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA ALSO PROVIDES VARYING AMOUNTS OF SUPPORT TO OTHER </p><p>RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS.  THESE INCLUDE:  SAIQA, WHICH </p><p>IS UNDER TOTAL SYRIAN CONTROL; THE ABU MUSA GROUP, NOW </p><p>ALMOST TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON DAMASCUS; THE POPULAR FRONT </p><p>FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE--GENERAL COMMAND </p><p>(PFLP-GC); AND THE MARXIST POPULAR FRONT FOR THE </p><p>LIBERATION OF PALESTINE (PFLP), WHICH NOW MAINTAINS ITS </p><p>PRINCIPAL BASE IN DAMASCUS. </p><p> </p><p>IN ALL, SYRIAN-SPONSORED GROUPS, INCLUDING THE ABU NIDAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION, WERE LINKED TO ABOUT 30 TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p>DURING 1985, A QUARTER OF THEM IN GREECE ALONE.  THE ABU </p><p>MUSA GROUP ANNOUNCED FROM DAMASCUS ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO BOMB AN EL AL AIRLINER, IN MADRID ON </p><p>JUNE 26 OF THIS YEAR.  THE SUSPECT IN THAT ATTEMPT HAS </p><p>ADMITTED BEING A MEMBER OF THE GROUP.  TWO WEEKS LATER, </p><p>OTHER GROUPS SUPPORTED BY SYRIA, THE PFLP AND THE </p><p>LEBANESE SYRIAN SOCIAL NATIONALIST PARTY, ATTEMPTED AN </p><p>ATTACK ON AN ISRAELI RESORT TOWN ON JULY 10, 1986. </p><p> </p><p>SUPPORT FOR NON-PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION TO THE RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS, A VARIETY </p><p>OF OTHER TERRORISTS HAVE FACILITIES AND RECEIVED </p><p>TERRORIST TRAINING IN SYRIA OR SYRIAN-CONTROLLED AREAS OF </p><p>LEBANON:  THE JAPANESE RED ARMY, THE KURDISH LABOR PARTY, </p><p>THE ARMENIAN SECRET ARMY FOR THE LIBERATION OF ARMENIA </p><p>(ASALA), AND THE PAKISTANI AL ZULFIKAR.  IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>LEBANESE ARMED REVOLUTIONARY FACTION (LARF) IS BASED IN </p><p>THE LEBANESE VILLAGE OF QUBAYAT, WITHIN THE AREA OF </p><p>SYRIAN CONTROL IN LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>TO THESE GROUPS MUST BE ADDED THE INDIVIDUAL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS WHO FREQUENT DAMASCUS.   BRUNO </p><p>BREGUET, AN ASSOCIATE OF CARLOS, THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORIST, WAS ARRESTED IN PARIS IN FEBRUARY 1982 FOR </p><p>TRANSPORTING ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES.  LATER RELEASED, HE WAS </p><p>RECENTLY SIGHTED ON A FLIGHT TO DAMASCUS, MET ON ARRIVAL </p><p>BY SYRIAN AUTHORITIES, AND ESCORTED THROUGH THE AIRPORT </p><p>WITHOUT HAVING TO PASS THROUGH THE NORMAL CONTROLS. </p><p>EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT FREDERIC ORIACH, A MILITANT MEMBER </p><p>OF THE  FRENCH ACTION DIRECT, SPENT JULY AND AUGUST 1986 </p><p>IN DAMASCUS PURSUING IDEOLOGICAL AND MILITARY STUDIES. </p><p> </p><p>CASUALTIES AND CONTROL </p><p> </p><p>ATTACKS BY SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS SINCE 1983 HAVE KILLED </p><p>OR WOUNDED NEARLY 500 PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS HAVE ATTACKED U.S. FACILITIES IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST OVER 10 TIMES SINCE 1983.  IN JORDAN LAST </p><p>YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, THE SYRIAN-SPONSORED JORDANIAN PEOPLES </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY PARTY ATTEMPTED TWO ANTI-U.S. ATTACKS. </p><p>BOMBS WERE FOUND AT A USAID EMPLOYEE\'S HOME AND AT THE </p><p>AMERICAN CENTER FOR ORIENTAL STUDIES.  THESE OPERATIONS, </p><p>AS WELL AS OTHERS AIMED AGAINST JORDANIAN TARGETS, HAVE </p><p>HALTED SINCE THE SYRIAN-JORDANIAN RAPPROCHEMENT LATE LAST </p><p>YEAR--UNDERSCORING SYRIA\'S ABILITY, IF IT WISHES, TO </p><p>CONTROL ITS SURROGATES\' ACTIVITIES AND TO SEVERELY CURB </p><p>THE CAPABILITY OF THOSE TO WHOM IT PROVIDED SAFE HAVEN </p><p>AND SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>THIS HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY A TOP SYRIAN OFFICIAL WHO </p><p>TRIED TO DISMISS, IN A WASHINGTON POST PRESS INTERV1EW </p><p>THIS SEPTEMBER, EVIDENCE THAT ABU NIDAL\'S GROUP WAS </p><p>INVOLVED IN TERRORIST ATTACKS.  SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>FAROUK CHARAA SAID IN DISCUSSING THE ACTIONS OF THE ABU </p><p>NIDAL GROUP:  "WHOEVER KNOWS MY GOVERNMENT MUST REALIZE </p><p>THAT SUCH ATTACKS COULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT WITHOUT ITS </p><p>AWARENESS."  (END TEXT OF FACT PAPER.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (BEGIN TEXT OF CHRONOLOGY) </p><p> </p><p>CHRONOLOGY OF SELECTED TERRORIST INCIDENTS BY </p><p>SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS:  1983-1986 </p><p> </p><p> THE FOLLOWING LIST OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS IS NOT </p><p>INTENDED TO BE ALL-INCLUSIVE BUT IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF </p><p>SYRIA\'S INVOLVEMENT IN AND SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM AND </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS.

HASI IS A BROTHER OF </p><p>        NIZAR HINDAWI, WHO WAS CONVICTED IN A BRITISH </p><p>        COURT FOR THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING OF AN EL AL </p><p>        AIRLINER. </p><p> </p><p>6 NOVEMBER  TURKEY.  TURKISH PROSECUTORS ISSUED AN </p><p>        INDICTMENT ACCUSING SIX PALESTINIANS WORKING </p><p>        FOR THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION OF KILLING A </p><p>        JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT IN JULY 1985.

THE INDICTMENT ALSO LINKED MEMBERS OF </p><p>        THE GROUP WITH FOUR OTHER ACTIONS:  THE </p><p>        SEPTEMBER 6, 1986 ATTACK ON AN ISTANBUL </p><p>        SYNAGOGUE, WHICH KILLED 22 PERSONS; AN ATTEMPT </p><p>        TO PLACE A BOMB ON AN ALITALIA FLIGHT IN 1983; </p><p>        THE ATTEMPTED CAR BOMBING OF A U.S. OFFICERS\' </p><p>        CLUB IN IZMIR IN 1983, AND THE KILLING OF A </p><p>        PALESTINIAN STUDENT IN ANKARA IN 1982. </p><p> </p><p>26 JUNE     MADRID.
