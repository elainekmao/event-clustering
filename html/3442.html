<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001788 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S (SCHLACHTER), AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, EAGR, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT FOOD AID IN ZIMBABWE; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Food aid prolongs nation\'s suffering" </p><p>      the independent weekly "The Financial Gazette" uses its </p><p>      August 1 editorial to castigate the government of Zimbabwe </p><p>      for causing the current food crisis and question the </p><p>      utility of Western food donations.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Zimbabweans, many of whom are threatened with </p><p>      starvation are undoubtedly grateful for the food aid that </p><p>      is being given to them by several foreign governments. </p><p>      Unfortunately, the reality is that aid is perpetuating and </p><p>      prolonging the wider suffering of Zimbabweans by giving </p><p>      them a false sense of food security when they should be </p><p>      seriously confronting the causes of their starvation in a </p><p>      rich farming land.  As long as the food handouts continue </p><p>      to come in, many in Zimbabwe and especially the government </p><p>      will not bother to examine why the country has sunk to this </p><p>      pathetic level, let alone to take corrective action. . .For </p><p>      Zimbabweans, the food aid gives them false comfort that all </p><p>      is well, shielding them from the harsh reality that they </p><p>      must take their destiny into their hands in the face of an </p><p>      administration that seems determined to do everything and </p><p>      anything that can make their lives as unbearable as is </p><p>      possible. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .But the issue of food aid, aside from </p><p>      promoting an unsustainable culture of dependency, </p><p>      goes far deeper than this in crisis-weary Zimbabwe. </p><p>      Plausible media reports continue to filter out from </p><p>      the countryside that some elements of the ruling </p><p>      ZANU PF party. . .are now using food aid as a </p><p>      political weapon.  These elements are denying food </p><p>      aid to those they suspect to be opposition members, </p><p>      clearly one of the worst human rights abuses and a </p><p>      serious challenge to the conscience of those foreign </p><p>      governments whose taxpayers\' money has been used to </p><p>      buy the food. . .Surely the government, however much </p><p>      it may hate the fact that the MDC (Movement for </p><p>      Democratic Change) is a reality, must take care of </p><p>      the interests of all Zimbabweans and not just those </p><p>      of its supporters.  The food aid. . .must be given </p><p>      to all who need it without any discrimination </p><p>      whatsoever.  Otherwise Zimbabweans will feel </p><p>      justified in refusing to pay taxes from which the </p><p>      food aid money is siphoned if the food is only meant </p><p>      for ZANU PF members.  There can be no two ways about </p><p>      this." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
