(U)  SUMMARY.  HA GIANG PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS ARE HOPEFUL </p><p>THAT THE RECENTLY DECLARED "BORDER ECONOMIC ZONE" WILL </p><p>STIMULATE DEVELOPMENT IN ONE OF NORTHERN VIETNAM\'S POORER </p><p>MOUNTAIN PROVINCES.  THE DISTANCE AND DIFFICULTY IN </p><p>TRAVELING TO HANOI AND OTHER LOWLAND PROVINCES REMAIN </p><p>HINDRANCES TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  SEPTELS REPORT ON </p><p>TERRORISM AND NARCOTICS-RELATED DISCUSSIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>A LONG ROAD TO THE NORTHERN FRONTIER </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  POLOFF AND POL FSN VISITED HA GIANG PROVINCE </p><p>JANUARY 14-16.  HA GIANG IS ABOUT 300 KILOMETERS FROM HANOI </p><p>AND SHARES A NEARLY 400 KILOMETER BORDER WITH CHINA.  THE </p><p>MAIN PROVINCIAL CROSSING POINT TO CHINA IS ABOUT 20 </p><p>KILOMETERS FROM HA GIANG TOWN AT THANH THUY.  CITIZENS FROM </p><p>THE DISTRICTS NEAR THE BORDER MAY CROSS OVER WITH A SPECIAL </p><p>PERMIT, BUT ONLY FOR DAY TRIPS (UNLIKE MORE LENIENT </p><p>PROVISIONS IN EFFECT IN QUANG NINH PROVINCE - REFTEL). </p><p>LONGER JOURNEYS REQUIRE PASSPORTS AND VISAS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ACCORDING TO VO DUC HONG, CHIEF OF THE BORDER </p><p>AFFAIRS DIVISION OF THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, ABOUT 80 PCT OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00133  01 OF 02  181028Z </p><p>HA GIANG\'S POPULATION OF 610,000 PEOPLE ARE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES.  THE LARGEST GROUPS ARE THE HMONG AND TAY NHUNG. </p><p>THE 9,000 SQUARE KILOMETER PROVINCE INCLUDES HIGH MOUNTAIN </p><p>AREAS (4,000 SQUARE KILOMETERS), HIGHLAND AREAS (1,000 </p><p>SQUARE KILOMETERS), AND LOWLAND AREAS (4,000 SQUARE </p><p>KILOMETERS).  ONLY ABOUT 13 PERCENT OF THE PROVINCE IS </p><p>CONSIDERED SUITABLE FOR FARMING.  ITS MAIN AGRICULTURAL </p><p>EXPORT IS TEA GROWN AT HIGH ELEVATIONS, POPULAR IN TAIWAN, </p><p>HONG KONG, KOREA, AND RUSSIA, HONG CLAIMED.  FRUIT, RICE, </p><p>AND CORN ARE OTHER MAIN CROPS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>STILL POOR, BUT IMPROVING </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  LE VAN BANG, THE DIRECTOR OF HA GIANG\'S PLANNING </p><p>AND INVESTMENT DEPARTMENT, CLAIMED THAT WHILE THE PROVINCE </p><p>WAS STILL "QUITE POOR," THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IS IMPROVING. </p><p>BANG NOTED THAT THE POVERTY RATE FROM 1995 TO 2001 HAD </p><p>DECLINED FROM 46 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION TO ABOUT 26 </p><p>PERCENT, THOUGH PER CAPITA INCOME IS STILL ONLY ABOUT 30 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF USD 380 PER YEAR, HONG </p><p>ADMITTED.  THE DECLINE IN POVERTY CAN BE ATTRIBUTED MAINLY </p><p>TO DIVERSIFIED AGRICULTURE, SOME INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND </p><p>MINERAL EXPLOITATION, INCLUDING IRON ORE, LEAD, AND ZINC, </p><p>BANG EXPLAINED.  IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, A CEMENT FACTORY, </p><p>THREE SMALL PAPER MILLS, AND TWO BRICK FACTORIES HAVE </p><p>OPENED, ALTHOUGH BANG DID NOT HAVE AVAILABLE STATISTICS ON </p><p>HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN THOSE FACTORIES OR IN </p><p>MINERAL EXPLOITATION.  BANG EXPRESSED INTEREST IN FINDING A </p><p>COMPANY TO INVEST IN A FRUIT PROCESSING PLANT, SINCE IN THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00133  01 OF 02  181028Z </p><p>PAST FEW YEARS FARMERS HAVE PLANTED MORE AND MORE FRUIT </p><p>TREES (ESPECIALLY ORANGES); TRANSPORTING THE FRESH FRUIT TO </p><p>MARKET IS PROBLEMATIC.  POLOFF PROMISED TO SHARE THIS </p><p>OPPORTUNITY WITH THE USCS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  WHILE THE ENTIRE PROVINCE IS CONNECTED TO THE </p><p>NATIONAL ELECTRICAL GRID, ONLY ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>POPULATION HAS ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY IN THEIR HOMES, BANG </p><p>SAID.  HE NOTED THAT THE DISTANCE FROM AND DIFFICULTY IN </p><p>TRAVELING TO HANOI AND OTHER LOWLAND PROVINCES REMAIN MAJOR </p><p>PROBLEMS.  WHILE TRAVEL TIME TO HANOI HAS BEEN REDUCED TO </p><p>ABOUT 7 HOURS AND NATIONAL HIGHWAY 2 IS BEING UPGRADED, </p><p>TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE STILL "MAY DISCOURAGE" </p><p>POTENTIAL INVESTORS FROM COMING TO HA GIANG, HE ADMITTED. </p><p>(NOTE:  THERE ARE SEVERAL SHORT STRETCHES WHERE THE ROAD IS </p><p>TWO FULL LANES AND NEWLY PAVED, BUT THERE ARE LONG STRETCHES </p><p>WHERE THE ROAD IS ONLY ABOUT ONE AND A HALF LANES AND VERY </p><p>BUMPY.  THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL ONE LANE BRIDGES.  THE GVN\'S </p><p>MASTER PLAN CALLS FOR COMPLETING THE UPGRADING OF HIGHWAY 2 </p><p>BY THE END OF 2005. END NOTE.)  SO FAR, THE PROVINCE HAS HAD </p><p>NO DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>BORDER ECONOMIC ZONE MAY HELP </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3257 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00133  02 OF 02  181028Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------59B69F  181029Z /38 </p><p>R 181014Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5276 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BANGKOK </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI//FPA// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ABLAGG// </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 000133 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 1431/MAC/AP/HPPHO </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00133  02 OF 02  181028Z </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  OFFICIALS EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT IMPLEMENTING </p><p>PLANS FOR A NEW "BORDER ECONOMIC ZONE" WILL SPUR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>IN THE PROVINCE.  IN DECEMBER 2001, THE GVN DECLARED THE </p><p>AREA AROUND THE THANH THUY BORDER CROSSING A BORDER ECONOMIC </p><p>ZONE.  SPECIAL ADVANTAGES INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS TO </p><p>STIMULATE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS FAVORABLE CONDITIONS </p><p>ON TAXES, A DUTY FREE MARKET, AND CONCESSIONS ON LAND FOR </p><p>DEVELOPING COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES.  BANG ADMITTED THAT, </p><p>WHILE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD DECLARED THE BORDER </p><p>ECONOMIC ZONE, "IT IS UP TO PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS TO WORK OUT </p><p>THE DETAILS."  ACCORDING TO BANG, HIS OFFICE IS WORKING ON A </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PLAN THAT HE HOPES WILL BE READY "BY THE END OF </p><p>2002." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  DURING A MID-AFTERNOON VISIT TO THE BORDER AREA, </p><p>NOT MUCH ACTIVITY WAS EVIDENT.  ABOUT 10 TRUCKS WERE WAITING </p><p>ON THE HA GIANG SIDE TO RECEIVE GOODS COMING OVER FROM </p><p>CHINA.  ACCORDING TO THE ARMY OFFICER WHO ESCORTED EMBOFFS, </p><p>ONLY ABOUT "NINE OR TEN" TRUCKS A DAY RECEIVE LOADS IN </p><p>EITHER DIRECTION.  A SLOW STREAM OF PEDESTRIANS WAS VISIBLE </p><p>CROSSING THE BORDER DURING EMBOFFS\' VISIT.  THE BORDER AREA </p><p>ALSO INCLUDES A TAX OFFICE, CUSTOMS HOUSE, AND A MODEST IF </p><p>SOMEWHAT RUNDOWN SHOPPING CENTER.  THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE\'S </p><p>HONG POINTED OUT TO EMBOFFS AN AREA ABOUT 100 METERS SOUTH </p><p>OF THE BORDER WHERE LAND WAS BEING LEVELED IN PREPARATION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00133  02 OF 02  181028Z </p><p>FOR A NEW SHOPPING AREA. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>WE DON\'T BUY FROM THE BORDER </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  CONVERSATIONS WITH SHOP OWNERS AROUND HA GIANG TOWN </p><p>PROVIDED SOME INSIGHT AS TO WHY THE BORDER CROSSING AT THANH </p><p>THUY IS RELATIVELY INACTIVE.  IN ONE SHOP SELLING HOUSEHOLD </p><p>ITEMS, THE OWNER SAID THAT ALTHOUGH MOST OF HER INVENTORY </p><p>CAME FROM CHINA, SHE DID NOT BUY IT FROM THE BORDER AREA. </p><p>SHE INSTEAD USED A HANOI SUPPLIER WHO BOUGHT GOODS COMING </p><p>FROM CHINA VIA THE LANG SON BORDER CROSSING TWO PROVINCES TO </p><p>THE EAST. (NOTE:  LANG SON IS CLOSER TO HANOI AND CONNECTED </p><p>BY A GOOD ROAD.  TRAVEL TIME TO HANOI IS ABOUT 2.5 HOURS. </p><p>END NOTE.)  THIS SUPPLIER TOOK THE GOODS TO HANOI, AND THEN </p><p>TRANSSHIPPED THEM TO HA GIANG.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION, </p><p>THE OWNER SAID THAT SHE DID NOT BUY FROM THE BORDER AREA </p><p>BECAUSE "THE CHINESE SELL US INFERIOR PRODUCTS AND WE CANNOT </p><p>RETURN THEM.  IF I HAVE A PROBLEM, MY HANOI SUPPLIER WILL </p><p>EXCHANGE THE ITEMS THAT ARE DEFECTIVE." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) ANOTHER SHOP OWNER SELLING CHILDRENS\' CLOTHES STATED </p><p>THAT SHE BOUGHT HER INVENTORY IN A SIMILAR MANNER, NOTING </p><p>THAT HER SUPPLIER SHIPPED GOODS TO HER VIA A "RELIABLE" BUS </p><p>DRIVER WHO MAKES REGULAR TRIPS BETWEEN HANOI AND HA GIANG. </p><p>BOTH SHOP OWNERS SAID THEY MADE OCCASIONAL DAY TRIPS TO </p><p>CHINA FOR PLEASURE AND PERSONAL SHOPPING.  THEY WERE AWARE </p><p>THAT THE GVN HAD ESTABLISHED THE BORDER ECONOMIC ZONE. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE CLOTHING SHOP OWNER SAID THAT SUCCESS WOULD </p><p>DEPEND "ON HOW THE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTS ITS PLANS."  BOTH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00133  02 OF 02  181028Z </p><p>INDICATED THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE DEVELOPMENT IN THE </p><p>BORDER AREA BECAUSE IT WOULD BE "MORE CONVENIENT" TO BUY AT </p><p>THANH THUY, ASSUMING THEY COULD RECEIVE GOOD QUALITY </p><p>MERCHANDISE AT REASONABLE PRICES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  IN RECENT YEARS, THE GVN HAS CLEARLY TAKEN STEPS </p><p>TO ASSIST HA GIANG TO IMPROVE ITS ECONOMIC SITUATION.  IN </p><p>THE ABSENCE OF RELIABLE INFRASTRUCTURE OR MORE AGGRESSIVE </p><p>SELF-PROMOTION BY PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, GROWTH IS </p><p>APT TO REMAIN SLOW AND POVERTY WILL REMAIN A DIFFICULT ISSUE </p><p>TO RESOLVE.  THE UNUSUALLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF MINORITY </p><p>POPULATION -- PROBABLY THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION -- ALSO </p><p>MEANS THAT COMPETENT LOCAL OFFICIALS FLUENT IN VIETNAMESE </p><p>MAY BE ANOTHER MAJOR LOCAL CONSTRAINT, HOWEVER MUCH IN GOOD </p><p>FAITH THE GVN TRIES TO ASSIST THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>INTEGRATION. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
