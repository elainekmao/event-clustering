<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ACCRA 004941 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/07 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, PGOV, GH </p><p>SUBJECT: A CLOSE LOOK AT GHANA\'S PRESIDENT RAWLINGS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ACCRA 01142 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY EDWARD BRYNN, COM, REASON 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE NETHERLANDS\' DEPARTING AMBASSADOR </p><p>TO GHANA, HEIN PRINCEN, SPENT A FULL WEEK-END IN CLOSE </p><p>QUARTERS WITH J. J. RAWLINGS, AND CAME AWAY BOTH </p><p>FASCINATED AND A BIT UNNERVED.  PRINCEN\'S SPOUSE, A </p><p>TRAINED SOCIAL WORKER, SAW INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE OF </p><p>DRUG USE BY THE PRESIDENT.  RAWLINGS COMPLAINED THAT HIS </p><p>ADVISORS KEEP HIM IN THE DARK.  HIS WIFE WAS PRESENT, </p><p>AND RAWLINGS WAS DEFERENTIAL TOWARDS HER, BUT IT WAS </p><p>CLEAR THAT THEY ARE SEEN TOGETHER ONLY FOR FAMILY </p><p>REASONS OR REASONS OF STATE.  PRINCEN FOUND RAWLINGS </p><p>TIRED OF HIS PUBLIC PERSONA AND EASILY PERSUADED THAT </p><p>PEOPLE WERE WORKING BEHIND HIS BACK.  RAWLINGS SEEMS </p><p>CAUGHT BETWEEN A DESIRE TO BRING HIS CHIEF OF STATE </p><p>TENURE TO A CLOSE ON ONE HAND, AND A LIVELY FEAR OF THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF SO DOING ON THE OTHER.  PRINCEN SAW </p><p>RAWLINGS\' NEWEST EMINENCE GRISE UP CLOSE, AND DID NOT </p><p>LIKE HIS BALEFUL INFLUENCE IN THE AREA OF GHANAIAN </p><p>ECONOMIC POLICY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE SETTING:  VERY OCCASIONALLY RAWLINGS INVITES </p><p>AN ACCREDITED DIPLOMAT TO JOIN HIS FAMILY FOR WEEK-END </p><p>RELAXATION AND CONVERSATION ON THE MODEST BUT </p><p>COMFORTABLE PRESIDENTIAL YACHT ANCHORED IN VOLTA LAKE </p><p>ONE HUNDRED MILES NORTHEAST OF ACCRA.  (THE LAST HONOREE </p><p>WAS AMERICAN AMBASSADOR KENNETH BROWN ON THE EVE OF HIS </p><p>DEPARTURE IN MID-1995.)  ALSO PRESENT WERE RAWLINGS\' SIX </p><p>CHILDREN, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR ANTHONY AIDOO (MORE </p><p>LATER), AN UNNAMED GERMAN ENGINEER/BOAT CAPTAIN, AND A </p><p>COUPLE OF MILITARY STAFFERS.  GUESTS SO HONORED ARE </p><p>ENJOINED NOT TO DISCUSS THE ADVENTURE INSIDE GHANA, AND </p><p>PRINCEN  ASSURED ME THAT I ALONE (IN GHANA) WAS PRIVY TO </p><p>WHAT FOLLOWS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE PRIVATE PERSONA:  AMBASSADOR PRINCEN\'S WIFE </p><p>CONCLUDED EMPHATICALLY THAT RAWLINGS IS A DRUG-USER. </p><p>PERIODS OF HIGH-LEVEL ENERGIZING WERE FOLLOWED BY </p><p>RAWLINGS\' DISAPPEARANCE FOR THIRTY MINUTES, AND UPON HIS </p><p>RETURN HE WAS SUBDUED AND EVEN MELLOW.  HE PERSPIRED </p><p>PROFUSELY AT SHORT NOTICE, AND CONSUMED LARGE QUANTITIES </p><p>OF NON-ALCOHOLIC DRINKS.  PRINCEN REINFORCED MY OWN </p><p>IMPRESSION THAT RAWLINGS\' ATTENTION SPAN HAS SHORTENED </p><p>OF LATE.  BUT THE PRINCENS FOUND THE PRESIDENT OPEN, </p><p>INDULGENT TOWARDS HIS CHILDREN, AND EXTREMELY </p><p>DEFERENTIAL - EVEN OBSEQUIOUS - TOWARDS HIS SPOUSE.  THE </p><p>TENOR OF THEIR CONVERSATION REINFORCED THE WIDESPREAD </p><p>IMPRESSION THAT THEY SEE EACH OTHER ONLY IN PUBLIC OR IN </p><p>THE CONTEXT OF THIS RETREAT TO LAKE VOLTA.  (RAWLINGS </p><p>SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST FAMILY GATHERING THIS YEAR.) </p><p>RAWLINGS WATCHED VIDEOS, LISTENED TO MUSIC, AND CHATTED </p><p>UP HIS GUESTS SIMULTAMEOUSLY.  PRINCEN NOTICED WHAT ALL </p><p>OF US OBSERVE AS INTERLOCUTORS:  RAWLINGS\' INCREDIBLE </p><p>INABILITY TO RECALL NAMES, EVEN THOSE OF ADVISERS </p><p>CONSTANTLY AT HIS ELBOW. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) RAWLINGS\' CIRCLE OF ADVISORS:  SINCE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS LAST DECEMBER </p><p>WE HAVE PUSHED THE THEME THAT PRESIDENT RAWLINGS SEEMS </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN STRIPPED OF A CIRCLE OF CONFIDANTS WHOSE </p><p>COLLECTIVE WEIGHT, WHILE FAR FROM BRILLIANT, APPEARED TO </p><p>MODERATE RAWLINGS\' TENDENCY TO OVERACT AT FIRST EVIDENCE </p><p>OF SOME UNPALATABLE DEVELOPMENT.  WE ARE NOW WELL INTO A </p><p>NEW PHASE, WHERE IT APPEARS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS FAR </p><p>FROM WELL INFORMED AS TO WHAT TRANSPIRES IN HIS NAME. </p><p>HE WAS MANIFESTLY OUT TO LUNCH ON THE PNG OF OUR PUBLIC </p><p>AFFAIRS OFFICER IN MAY.  WORLD BANK AND IMF VISITORS </p><p>COMPLAIN THAT HE SEEMS PROFOUNDLY UNINFORMED ON ECONOMIC </p><p>MATTERS, EVEN AS HIS MINISTER OF FINANCE IS SEEN BY </p><p>FINANCIAL EXPERTS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GHANA AS ALARMINGLY </p><p>INCOMPETENT.  INTO THE VACUUM HAS MOVED ANTHONY AIDOO, </p><p>WHOSE CONSPIRATORIAL DEMEANOR ENCOURAGES DARK </p><p>SPECULATION ABOUT HIS MALIGN INFLUENCE ON RAWLINGS. </p><p>AIDOO IS KNOWN TO US PRINCIPALLY FOR HIS ENTRENCHED </p><p>LEFTIST LEANINGS, HIS ANTI-IMPERIALIST RHETORIC WHILE A </p><p>PROFESSOR AT CAPE COAST UNIVERSITY, AND HIS AFFECTION </p><p>FOR THE LIKES OF QADAFI AND CASTRO.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>PRINCEN\'S OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH AIDOO AT CLOSE QUARTERS </p><p>WAS FAR FROM REASSURING.  AIDOO SEEMED TO REINFORCE </p><p>RAWLINGS\' FEARS THAT SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE </p><p>CONSPIRING TO HIDE THINGS FROM THE PRESIDENT.  AIDOO\'S </p><p>OBSEQUIOUS BEHAVIOR TOWARDS MRS. RAWLINGS ALSO </p><p>REINFORCED THE IMPRESSION HERE IN ACCRA THAT SHE IS IN </p><p>SOME DEGREE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ALIENATION OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S TRADITIONAL FRIENDS, WITH AIDOO NOW FILLING </p><p>THE VOID. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IMPACT ON ECONOMIC POLICY:  ACCORDING TO PRINCEN </p><p>THE ONLY SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON </p><p>GHANA\'S CURRENT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  PRINCEN WAS </p><p>INTRIGUED TO SEE RAWLINGS NODDING IN ASSENT AT AIDOO\'S </p><p>PRONOUNCEMENT THAT HIGH INFLATION WAS CAUSED BY </p><p>IRRESPONSIBLE ELEMENTS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND THAT </p><p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR SHOULD FIND A SOLUTION.  AIDOO ALSO </p><p>FED RAWLINGS THE NOTION THAT THE NORTH CAROLINA SUMMIT </p><p>ON GHANA\'S COMPETITIVENESS IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE WAS </p><p>A CAMOUFLAGED ATTACK ON RAWLINGS\' NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CONGRESS.  PRINCEN REMONSTRATED, BUT HE THOUGHT WITH </p><p>LIMITED EFFECT. PRINCEN DID GAIN RAWLINGS\' ATTENTION BY </p><p>REGISTERING IMPRESSIONS CIRCULATING IN ACCRA THAT THE </p><p>WORLD BANK AND IMF ARE INCREASINGLY DISSATISFIED WITH </p><p>THE PERFORMANCE OF BOTH THE INCUMBENT MINISTER OF </p><p>FINANCE PEPPRAH AND THE LARGER ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE </p><p>POST-DECEMBER GOVERNMENT.  RAWLINGS RESPONDED BY LASHING </p><p>OUT AT MEMBERS OF HIS OWN GOVERNMENT - SOME WERE CITED </p><p>BY NAME - WHO DELIBERATELY CONCEAL PROBLEMS FROM HIS </p><p>ATTENTION.  RAWLINGS BUILT UP A HEAD OF STEAM ON THE </p><p>GHANA ELECTRICAL COMMISSION\'S ANNOUNCEMENT TWO WEEKS AGO </p><p>THAT RATES WOULD RISE UP TO 300, RETROACTIVE TO MAY 1; </p><p>THIS WAS DESIGNED TO DESTABILIZE HIS GOVERNMENT, HE </p><p>THOUGHT.  THE LARGER IMPRESSION, HOWEVER, WAS THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT RAWLINGS WAS NOT WELL INFORMED OF RECENT </p><p>UNSETTLING ECONOMIC TRENDS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  THE IMPRESSIONS REGISTERED ABOVE ARE </p><p>THOSE OF A VETERAN CAREER DIPLOMAT (PREVIOUSLY </p><p>AMBASSADOR IN PERU AND NOW OFF TO SRI LAMKA) WHOSE </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL OBSERVATIONS ON OTHER OCCASIONS HAVE HELD </p><p>UP WELL.  PRINCEN\'S OBSERVATIONS ECHO IMPRESSIONS I </p><p>RECORDED EARLIER THIS YEAR (REFTEL).  IF THEY HOLD </p><p>WATER, WE MUST SEE IN THEM A GIANT STEP BACKWARDS IF </p><p>CLOSE CONFIDANTS LIKE ANTHONY AIDOO ARE PREJUDICING THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AGAINST THE TRADE AND INVESTMENT INITIATIVE </p><p>LAUNCHED AT CHAPEL HILL IN EARLY JUNE.  AND, IN A LARGER </p><p>ARENA, IF AS A RESULT OF FATIGUE OR ISOLATION OR </p><p>UNHEALTHY PERSONAL PRACTICES PRESIDENT RAWLINGS FAILS TO </p><p>EXERCISE LEADERSHIP SKILLS DURING HIS SECOND </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL TERM, THERE MIGHT BE DELETERIOUS </p><p>REPERCUSSIONS FOR ALL THAT TOUCHES ON THE ECONOMY:  THE </p><p>GROWTH OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS;  THE CONTINUATION OF </p><p>AN ERA OF DOMESTIC PEACE;  THE EMERGENCE OF A PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR ABLE TO INVITE SIGNIFICANT OUTSIDE INVESTMENT AND </p><p>PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>PRINCEN NOTED THAT RAWLINGS PLANS TO MARK MY OWN </p><p>DEPARTURE WITH A SIMILAR WEEK-END ADVENTURE.  BUT AS IT </p><p>NOW STANDS THAT MAY NOT COME SOON, LEAVING MUCH TIME FOR </p><p>ANTHONY AIDOO TO BREW A POISONOUS POTION IN THE CASTLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRYNN </p><p></p></div>
