KUWAIT 1482; B. ABU DHABI 1461; C. ABU </p><p>DHABI 2013; D. ABU DHABI 2654 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  SHAYKH AL-KUBAYSI "MODERATES" TONE WITH LOCAL </p><p>ARAB MEDIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  ON JULY 3-4, ABU DHABI\'S </p><p>ARABIC LANGUAGE DAILY "AL ITTIHAD" PUBLISHED A TWO-PART </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH ISLAMIC MUFTI DR. AHMAD AL-KUBAYSI.  PER </p><p>REFTELS, AL-KUBAYSI HAD CRITICIZED THE U.S.-LED WAR AND </p><p>AUTHORITY IN IRAQ SEVERELY DURING PREVIOUS PUBLIC </p><p>APPEARANCES.  MOST NOTABLE WAS HIS APRIL 18TH FRIDAY </p><p>SERMON AT BAGHDAD\'S ABU HANIFA AL-NO\'MAN MOSQUE </p><p>FOLLOWING THE FALL OF SADDAM\'S REGIME, A SERMON IN WHICH </p><p>AL-KUBAYSI ENCOURAGED WORSHIPPERS TO RESIST THE AMERICAN </p><p>"OCCUPATION" OF IRAQ AND DEMONSTRATE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN THIS INTERVIEW, UNLIKE HIS EARLIER RHETORIC, AL- </p><p>KUBAYSI COUNSELED IRAQIS TO "GIVE THE AMERICANS A </p><p>CHANCE" TO "ESTABLISH A NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>REBUILD IRAQ."  KUBAYSI ASSERTED THAT ANY IRAQI </p><p>GOVERNMENT MUST BE SECULAR IN NATURE AND THE "SUBJECT OF </p><p>A PUBLIC REFERENDUM SO THAT IRAQIS CAN DECIDE THEIR </p><p>FUTURE."  WHILE STILL CRITICAL OF U.S. MOTIVES FOR IRAQ, </p><p>THE INTERVIEW IS A WELCOME SHIFT FOR THIS PROMINENT YET </p><p>FIERY RELIGIOUS LEADER, AN INDIVIDUAL MANY BELIEVE HAS </p><p>THE ABILITY TO SHAPE LOCAL AND REGIONAL VIEWS ON THE </p><p>EMERGING IRAQ.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>HAPPY TO BE BACK IN IRAQ </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON JULY 3 AND 4, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY "AL-ITTIHAD" RAN AN INTERVIEW IN TWO PARTS, </p><p>FULL-PAGE EACH DAY, WITH PROMINENT ISLAMIC MUFTI DR. </p><p>AHMAD AL-KUBAYSI.  IN SHARP CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS </p><p>STATEMENTS (SEE REFTELS), AL-KUBAYSI, WHO HAS BASED </p><p>HIMSELF IN THE UAE FOR SEVERAL YEARS, URGED IRAQIS TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE REBUILDING PROCESS.  CLAIMING HE HAS </p><p>"NO POLITICAL AMBITIONS," HE EXPRESSED HIS GRATITUDE TO </p><p>RESUME A ROLE IN THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP OF IRAQ, TO </p><p>WHICH HE HAD NOT RETURNED SINCE A 1997 DISPUTE WITH UDAY </p><p>HUSSEIN LEFT HIM WANTED "DEAD OR ALIVE." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>ANGRY AND OCCUPIED BUT PATIENCE COUNSELED </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ON JULY 3, AL-KUBAYSI EXPLAINED HIS HARSH ANTI- </p><p>AMERICAN SERMON OF APRIL 18TH AT BAGHDAD\'S ABU HANIFA AL- </p><p>NO\'MAN MOSQUE:  "I WAS EXTREMELY INFLUENCED BY WHAT I </p><p>SAW .. THERE WAS SYSTEMATIC DESTRUCTION, OUR TREASURES </p><p>WERE ROBBED, AND OUR SECURITY WAS LOST.  WHAT WOULD </p><p>SOMEONE LIKE ME DO AFTER MANY YEARS AWAY FROM IRAQ?" </p><p>DESPITE THESE EMOTIONS," AL-KUBAYSI RECOUNTED THAT </p><p>"EVERYONE WANTED TO RESIST ... BUT WE WERE PERSUADED </p><p>THAT WE HAD LOST AND WERE NOW OCCUPIED.  THE AMERICANS </p><p>ARE THE MASTERS AND WE ARE THE SLAVES ... WE AGREED THAT </p><p>WHAT WE LOST IN THE WAR WE NEED TO REGAIN THROUGH PEACE </p><p>AND WE SHOULD GIVE THE AMERICANS A CHANCE TO DO AS THEY </p><p>PROMISED ... WE DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ESTABLISHED A </p><p>NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT AND REBUILD IRAQ DESPITE THEIR </p><p>AMBITIONS ON OUR OIL ..."  HOWEVER, AL-KUBAYSI ASSERTED </p><p>THAT THE AMERICANS COULD DO MORE NOW TO IMPROVE THEIR </p><p>IMAGE AMONG IRAQIS:  "THE AMERICANS HUMILIATE PEOPLE </p><p>WHEN THEY ARREST THEM, AND THESE PEOPLE ARE UNIVERSITY </p><p>PROFESSORS, TRIBAL LEADERS AND RELIGIOUS ULAMAS." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>STRONG SECULAR GOVERNMENT OF ALL GROUPS BEST FOR IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  ON JULY 4, AL-KUBAYSI SUPPORTED CREATING A </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH STRONG INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTATIVE OF </p><p>ALL IRAQIS:  "DEMANDING AN ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT IN IRAQ IS </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE, BECAUSE RELIGION IS THE LAST UMBRELLA THAT </p><p>WILL BRING IRAQIS TOGETHER.  I AM NOT FOR A SECULAR OR </p><p>ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT.  I WANT AN IRAQI GOVERNMENT WITH </p><p>STRONG INSTITUTIONS THAT IS BACKED BY ALL OF ITS PEOPLE, </p><p>MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS, SHI\'AS, AND SUNNIS.  AFTER, THEN WE </p><p>ASK THE IRAQIS WHAT THEY WANT.  WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC </p><p>... IRAQ CONTAINS VARIOUS SECTS AND ETHNIC GROUPS." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OF RETURN OF CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6.  AT THE SAME TIME, AL-KUBAYSI VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>RETURN OF A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY, CLAIMING THAT </p><p>"THERE IS A STRONG TENDENCY OF IRAQIS TO WELCOME THE </p><p>RETURN OF A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY, IT BEING THE MOST </p><p>QUALIFIED SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN IRAQI UNITY ... OUR ONLY </p><p>TIME OF PROSPERITY WAS DURING THE MONARCHY.  THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE </p><p>KING DID NOT RULE, AND THE GOVERNMENT USED TO BE CHAIRED </p><p>BY THE SHI\'ITES, KURDS, AND SUNNIS WITHOUT ANY </p><p>COMPLICATIONS OR COUPS.  I SUPPORT THE REESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF THE MONARCHY, FOR IT WOULD PREVENT ANY SECTARIAN </p><p>SPLIT IN IRAQ."  AL-KUBAYSI ALSO SPECULATED THAT "THE </p><p>FAMILIES LIKELY TO REGAIN THE IRAQI THRONE ARE THE </p><p>HASHEMITES, THE SHAMMAR TRIBE, AND THE JILANI FAMILY" </p><p>BUT NOTED THAT ANY GOVERNMENT AND ITS LEADERS MUST "BE </p><p>THE SUBJECT OF A PUBLIC REFERENDUM SO THAT IRAQIS CAN </p><p>DECIDE THEIR FUTURE AND HAVE THEIR SAY IN A FREE AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIC WAY." </p><p> </p><p>7.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
