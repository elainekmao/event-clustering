End summary. </p><p> </p><p>FUEL PRICES NOW ON PAR WITH INDIA </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On March 26, at the recommendation of the Nepal Oil </p><p>Corporation (NOC), the Government of Nepal (GON) announced </p><p>substantial price increases on all petroleum products, to </p><p>bring them into line with fuel prices across the border in </p><p>India.  The government also has reintroduced a two-tiered </p><p>pricing and rationing system for kerosene, the fuel most </p><p>commonly used by domestic consumers.  Under the new system, </p><p>"middle and lower class consumers" will pay 5 Nepali rupees </p><p>(6 cents) less per liter than industrial and "upper class" </p><p>purchasers and will receive rationing coupons allowing them </p><p>to purchase up to 10 liters of kerosene per month.  However, </p><p>no criteria have been established yet for "middle and lower </p><p>class" designation, and a source at the Ministry of Industry, </p><p>Commerce and Supply told Political FSN that, in reality, one </p><p>coupon would likely be provided to every family that requests </p><p>one, regardless of economic status. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Prior to the price hike, fuel prices in India were </p><p>substantially higher than those in Nepal.  In towns along the </p><p>border, the Indian price per liter for kerosene was almost 11 </p><p>Nepali rupees (14 cents) higher than in Nepal.  The price of </p><p>a liter of diesel was approximately 10 Nrs (13 cents) higher, </p><p>and the cost of a liter of petrol was approximately 4.5 </p><p>rupees (5 cents) higher.   Since Nepal imports fuel </p><p>exclusively from India, the disparity in prices caused the </p><p>NOC to post monthly losses running into the hundreds of </p><p>millions of rupees, and the state-owned corporation has been </p><p>seeking a price increase for the last eight months. </p><p> </p><p>RUMORS ABOUND; SO DO REAL PROBLEMS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Media reports stating that the NOC was in dire straits </p><p>convinced companies that a severe price hike was in the </p><p>offing.  As a result, over the past few weeks industrial </p><p>consumers purchased excessive amounts of fuel, despite </p><p>already holding large stockpiles.  Domestic consumers, </p><p>worried by the same reports as well as by media-fed rumors </p><p>that the war in the Gulf will further restrict supply, lined </p><p>up outside fuel stations to purchase far more than usual.  In </p><p>addition, large quantities of cheaper fuel were flowing back </p><p>across the border for resale at Indian prices.  Consumer </p><p>hoarding and the artificial demand from India were depleting </p><p>the already small petroleum reserves, reported to be about 17 </p><p>days worth of fuel, held by the NOC. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) To try to check "panic buying" among consumers, on </p><p>March 22 the GON decided to place restrictions on the number </p><p>of vehicles allowed on the roads.  Cars with even-numbered </p><p>license plates were allowed to travel on even-numbered days, </p><p>and odd-numbered vehicles on odd-numbered days.  However, on </p><p>March 26, the Supreme Court placed a temporary stay on the </p><p>enforcement of the restrictions, pending a final verdict on </p><p>the measure\'s legality. </p><p> </p><p>HALF A SOLUTION IS BETTER THAN NONE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Public concerns about the solvency of NOC were </p><p>well-founded.  On March 24, PolFSN spoke to Bijendra Singh </p><p>(protect), Chief of Distribution for NOC, about the unfolding </p><p>events.  According to Singh, the NOC is almost completely out </p><p>of funds, and is "not in a position to settle its bill with </p><p>the Indian Oil Corporation."  The next payment, for fuel </p><p>purchases in February and March, is due on April 15.  In the </p><p>event of non-payment, the IOC has already indicated that it </p><p>will cut off supply to Nepal.  According to the acting chief </p><p>of the NOC, contacted by PolFSN on March 26, by the end of </p><p>March, NOC will owe a total of 930 million Indian rupees </p><p>(IRs) (19.5 million USD) to the IOC, and will make a partial </p><p>payment of 450 million IRs (9.5 million USD). By April 15, </p><p>the amount due will be up to 1.8 billion IRs (37.8 million </p><p>USD), of which the NOC plans to pay 800 million IRs (16.8 </p><p>million USD).  The acting chief could not explain how the NOC </p><p>plans to pay the remaining amount. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Following the price hike, Rudra Bahadur Khadka, </p><p>Managing Director of the NOC, told reporters that the </p><p>increase has addressed the root of the problem, as the </p><p>selling price is now equal to the import price.  However, the </p><p>acting Chief of the NOC told PolFSN that the recent increase </p><p>in price will simply reduce the corporation\'s losses, and </p><p>that the corporation would be able to clear only partially </p><p>its balance with the IOC.  According to the acting chief, the </p><p>Nepali corporation had been losing approximately 750-800 </p><p>million Nrs (9.6 - 10.3 million USD) per month; monthly </p><p>losses will now be 100-120 million Nrs (1.3 - 1.5 million </p><p>USD). </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The price increase for petrol products is likely to </p><p>stretch the budgets of Nepal\'s middle and lower classes, but </p><p>the measure was a necessary evil.  NOC\'s mounting losses </p><p>created an artificial situation in which kerosene cost less </p><p>than mineral water.  The country\'s continued fuel supply was </p><p>at risk and its limited current supply, purchased at a loss, </p><p>was flowing back across the border.  While the proposed </p><p>two-tiered pricing system and rationing cards for kerosene </p><p>may be an artful political dodge, it would be better for </p><p>Nepal to bite the bullet now and raise prices across the </p><p>board. If the two-tier system is implemented, it will simply </p><p>reduce the urgently needed revenue that the price hike is </p><p>intended to generate, and prolong the NOC\'s inability to meet </p><p>its financial obligations.  Crises like this week\'s will </p><p>continue to arise as long as government subsidies continue to </p><p>co-exist with a lengthy, porous international border.  Post </p><p>will continue to monitor the situation for potential </p><p>political backlash, either tied to the war in the Gulf or </p><p>directed solely at domestic actors. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
