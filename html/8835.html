<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001722 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE, NSC FOR DEPUTY </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR HADLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, MARR, SMIG, PARM, CA, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH NEW CANADIAN DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER HARDER </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 164143 (B) USUN 1525 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Paul Cellucci, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>SUMMARY AND COMMENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Peter Harder, Canada\'s new Deputy Foreign Minister, </p><p>met with Ambassador Cellucci on June 17 to discuss the </p><p>bilateral relationship and his June 19-20 visit to </p><p>Washington.  Harder and the Ambassador discussed management </p><p>of the relationship, energy cooperation, missile defense, the </p><p>ICC, the Trafficking in Persons report, and the Proliferation </p><p>Security Initiative.  Harder\'s appointment is part of an </p><p>effort, led by Privy Council Clerk Alex Himelfarb (a close </p><p>friend of Harder\'s), to get U.S.-Canada relations on a better </p><p>footing.  We expect Harder to be more pragmatic in his </p><p>approach to the relationship than is usually the case at </p><p>Foreign Affairs.  As Deputy Minister at Industry Canada (his </p><p>previous post), Harder told his staff that the biggest </p><p>priority for Canada is how it can exist and prosper in "this </p><p>North American space."  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Harder told the Ambassador that meeting with him and </p><p>visiting Washington were top priorities for his first week on </p><p>the job.  While in Washington June 19-20, Harder will be </p><p>meeting with Deputy Secretary Armitage and Deputy National </p><p>Security Advisor Hadley, among others.  The Ambassador </p><p>responded that while there have been strains in the bilateral </p><p>relationship over Iraq, the relationship remains strong.  He </p><p>noted that the "Buy American" provision in the House version </p><p>of the 2004 Defense Authorization Bill (ref. A) was motivated </p><p>in part by some members\' desire to punish Canada for its </p><p>position on Iraq, but that State and Defense are opposing the </p><p>provision. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Harder said that Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) and the </p><p>Government as a whole are looking at how to better manage </p><p>U.S.-Canada relations, making for more coherent policy across </p><p>the many agencies involved.  The Ambassador cited the GoC\'s </p><p>proposed legislation to decriminalize marijuana as a policy </p><p>initiative in one area that would have detrimental effects in </p><p>another, the border.  Harder agreed.  He noted that greater </p><p>central supervision of the bilateral relationship is also </p><p>being discussed by the contenders in the Liberal Party </p><p>leadership race. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Harder said that the GoC needed to work on its </p><p>"post-NAFTA" agenda, strengthening the bilateral economic </p><p>relationship and "trilateralizing" some issues to include </p><p>Mexico.  The private sector would need to be consulted, he </p><p>said, because its support had been critical for pushing </p><p>through both the bilateral Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA. </p><p>Provincial Premiers and U.S. Governors should also be engaged </p><p>more often on issues such as energy transmission.  Harder was </p><p>pleased that Canadian is increasing its diplomatic presence </p><p>in the U.S., and said that Industry Canada had sacrificed 25% </p><p>of its incremental budget in FY2003-2004 to help fund this </p><p>expansion. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador observed that the relationship between </p><p>Secretary of Homeland Security Ridge and Deputy Prime </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Minister Manley was excellent, but that Manley\'s future was </p><p>uncertain given the Liberal leadership race.  Harder said </p><p>that our border management cooperation needed to be </p><p>institutionalized.  He noted that in 1993, the Conservative </p><p>government of the day had created a Department of Public </p><p>Security, which drew together many of the same functions as </p><p>the U.S. has now done under Homeland Security.   Harder </p><p>became Deputy Minister of Public Security, but the Department </p><p>was closed after only a few months because of concerns that </p><p>immigration should be kept separate from law enforcement. </p><p>Harder did not expect the GoC to create a new </p><p>"super-department," but it was clear that stovepiping needed </p><p>to be reduced. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>MISSILE DEFENSE/NORAD </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) On missile defense, the Ambassador welcomed the June </p><p>18 visit to Washington by a Canadian delegation to discuss </p><p>potential Canadian participation.  He noted that the missile </p><p>defense execution mission would be at NORTHCOM, instead of </p><p>NORAD, but said that Canadian participation was important to </p><p>continue our longstanding cooperation in North American </p><p>defense.  Harder said that DFAIT and National Defense hope to </p><p>be able to complete negotiations and report to Cabinet in the </p><p>fall, but their understanding from DoD is that this will take </p><p>longer.  Harder added that Foreign Minister Graham is </p><p>planning to visit NORAD August 28-29, and that he may try to </p><p>join Graham for that visit.  The Ambassador encouraged him to </p><p>do so. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ICC/UNSC RESOLUTION 1422 </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On the ICC, the Ambassador raised Canadian PermRep </p><p>Heinbecker\'s statement opposing UNSC Resolution 1422 (ref. </p><p>B), and said that Canada should be sensitive to the U.S. </p><p>position.  We want to continue to support peacekeeping </p><p>operations, but we\'re a target internationally, as evidenced </p><p>by the outrageous war crimes charges brought against U.S. </p><p>officials in Belgium.  Harder responded that Heinbecker was </p><p>simply restating Canadian policy, and that DFAIT was careful </p><p>to ensure that his statement did not directly criticize the </p><p>U.S.  He hoped that the U.S. position would change once the </p><p>ICC had a track record showing that it would not allow </p><p>frivolous claims. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On the recent Trafficking in Persons report, the </p><p>Ambassador explained that Canada had been dropped from Tier 1 </p><p>to Tier 2 status because of inadequate enforcement and </p><p>prosecution.  We hope that the anti-trafficking legislation </p><p>Canada enacted in 2002 will make a difference.  Harder said </p><p>that Citizenship and Immigration Canada was puzzled by the </p><p>lower ranking, and that our official cooperation on this </p><p>issue has been excellent.  The Ambassador said that one area </p><p>where Canada could help would be removal of South Korea from </p><p>its visa waiver program, as this is one route for sex trade </p><p>victims to enter Canada. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PROLIFERATION SECURITY INITIATIVE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Harder expressed his disappointment that Canada had </p><p>not been invited to participate in the June 12 Madrid meeting </p><p>on the Proliferation Security Initiative, given Canada\'s </p><p>activism on non-proliferation issues and our North American </p><p>security cooperation.  Harder said that Defense Minister </p><p>McCallum had raised this with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld at </p><p>NATO, and that DFAIT Assistant Deputy Minister Wright would </p><p>do so with Under Secretary Bolton. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>BIO NOTE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Harder is a career public servant who began at </p><p>DFAIT but has served in a number of different departments. </p><p>Harder, now 50, was the second youngest Canadian ever </p><p>appointed as a deputy minister in 1991.  According to </p><p>contacts at Industry Canada, he focuses on making decisions </p><p>which will serve the interests of the largest number of </p><p>Canadians, and presses his staff to identify such choices. </p><p>He is sharp, affable, and popular with his staff.  Harder\'s </p><p>right hand person is Pam LeBlanc, who has been with him in at </p><p>least four assignments and joins him again at DFAIT.  Harder </p><p>is part of the inner circle of senior Canadian bureaucrats, </p><p>most of whom expect he will be the next Clerk of the Privy </p><p>Council, the top civil servant position in Ottawa.  At DFAIT, </p><p>Harder replaces Gaetan Lavertu, who has been re-assigned as </p><p>Ambassador to Mexico. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
