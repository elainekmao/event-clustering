<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001463 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/FO AND AF/S; NSC FOR SR DIR JENDAYI FRAZER, </p><p>AID FOR AFR; </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: OPPOSITION MAYORS OF HARARE AND CHITUNGWIZA FACE </p><p>GOZ OBSTACLES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary:  The Ambassador met separately the week of </p><p>June 10 with MDC Mayors of Harare and Chitungwiza.  Their </p><p>styles could not be more different. Harare Mayor Mudzuri </p><p>served as chief city engineer and won a contentious and </p><p>flashy campaign for the MDC mayoral nomination, while </p><p>Chitungwiza Mayor Misheck Shoko is a soft-spoken former </p><p>school headmaster with war-veteran credentials and a </p><p>pragmatic bent. Both are hamstrung by Local Government </p><p>Minister Ignatius Chombo, who has substantial authority and </p><p>motive to make their jobs difficult.  While both are </p><p>bedeviled by staffs chosen by ZANU-PF predecessors whom </p><p>Chombo has intervened to protect, while Chitungwiza is </p><p>additionally handicapped by a town council dominated by </p><p>ZANU-PF(since only Harare had simultaneous Council elections. </p><p> Both mayors recognized, however, that no excuses will make </p><p>up for failure to deliver for their residents.  Harare, in </p><p>particular, with a substantial revenue base and succeeding a </p><p>corrupt and ineffective interim city management, has stepped </p><p>out smartly to repair streets and public works. We will be </p><p>looking at ways that we can help these new administrations </p><p>get off to a good start.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Harare Mayor Mudzuri beat out the Chairman of the </p><p>Combined Harare Residents\' Association (CHRA) David Samudzimi </p><p>for the MDC mayoral nomination, reportedly by doing politics </p><p>the "old-fashioned way" through free lunches and beers. </p><p>Mudziri also got off on the wrong foot with some in CHRA and </p><p>the MDC by taking possession of the mayoral Mercedes and </p><p>moving into the guest house of a lavish mayoral mansion built </p><p>by the previous regime. (Minister Chombo was only too happy </p><p>to fuel this dispute by requiring that the Mayor occupy the </p><p>mansion rather than sell it off.)  Public criticism of the </p><p>Mayor for "intolerable acquiescence to the Minister\'s </p><p>dictates" by new CHRA Acting Director Mike Davies brought the </p><p>disputes among the opposition into embarrassing public light. </p><p> Subsequently, the MDC and Mayor Mudziri have worked hard to </p><p>repair the damage and present a united fight, both </p><p>recognizing that Chombo will do nothing to help the Harare </p><p>city administration and will take full profit from MDC </p><p>disunity. </p><p> </p><p>3. (c) During his meeting with the Ambassador, Mudziri </p><p>complained that Minister Chombo had reversed virtually all </p><p>the terminations of eleventh-hour ZANU-PF appointments, </p><p>including that of notorious war veteran leader Joseph </p><p>Chinotimba as a city security officer.  Chombo has directed </p><p>that all personnel and financial decisions by the city be </p><p>referred to him.  Mudzuri noted that even the City Council\'s </p><p>sacking of a high-ranking ZANU-PF official as the city\'s </p><p>recently appointed public relations director awaited Chombo\'s </p><p>approval.  Mudzuri told the Ambassador that the law was </p><p>unfortunately on Chombo\'s side and there was little point </p><p>fighting in court.  Instead, he would act in every area </p><p>possible without asking permission.  For example, the Mayor </p><p>intended to carry out an audit of city accounts by </p><p>Price-Waterhouse for 2.5 million Zimdollars(about 500 </p><p>thousand US dollars at the official rate). Mudziri said that </p><p>he stated that he had good relations with citizens\' groups </p><p>and that he was also seeking to repair his relations with the </p><p>CHRA, although there were still some difficulties.  He also </p><p>said that he was focusing on long-neglected public works and </p><p>street repairs in these early months in order to show the </p><p>citizenry that he was working in their interests.  He </p><p>expressed interest in training opportunities for city </p><p>officials and councilors and in reviving a dormant </p><p>relationship with Harare\'s sister city of Cincinnati. </p><p> </p><p>4,(c) Chitungwiza Mayor Shoko has gotten off to a better </p><p>start with civil society by meeting with them early on.  His </p><p>inherited city council, however, is dominated by ZANU-PF war </p><p>veterans and have stormily opposed most of his initiatives, </p><p>including the concept of consultation with residents.  The </p><p>Mayor told the Ambassador that the only gesture of </p><p>conciliation offered by his Councilors was an offer to cut </p><p>him in on a mutual distribution of commercial plots to be </p><p>operated or sold by the Mayor and Councilors.  His rejection </p><p>of the offer and the scheme won him no friends in the </p><p>Council.  Shoko also complained that he has no employees of </p><p>confidence in his administration, including his security.  As </p><p>an ex war veteran himself, Shoko said that he was dealing </p><p>with his political problems in a personal way without backing </p><p>down.  He is also hamstrung by Minister Chombo, who recently </p><p>overruled Shoko\'s efforts to dismiss those city councilors </p><p>who had violated rules against missing more than two </p><p>consecutive council meetings.  Shoko was also anxious to </p><p>cooperate with us in addressing his high density suburb\'s </p><p>myriad problems. </p><p> </p><p>5. (c) Comment:  These two mayors have assumed challenging </p><p>tasks at a time when the country\'s economy is collapsing. </p><p>They will get no favors and only obstruction from Minister </p><p>Chombo.  But as the MDC seeks to show it is more than an </p><p>opposition party, how it does in these highly visible posts </p><p>takes on added importance.  We will work with these two </p><p>newcomers to see how we might help them within the context of </p><p>our pilot programs on local government. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
