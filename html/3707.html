<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005213 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON 9/11 ANNIVERSARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers published today, </p><p>September 12, highlight the world\'s commemoration of </p><p>the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks. </p><p>Other lead stories include the resignation of the </p><p>Palestinian cabinet and the announcement that </p><p>Palestinian general elections will be held on January </p><p>20.  Amidst reports about Iraq\'s "grave threat" and </p><p>the U.S. determination to "remove" this threat, all </p><p>papers highlight U.N. Secretary General Annan\'s </p><p>remarks saying that only the Security Council could </p><p>provide the legitimacy needed to be able to act </p><p>against threats to international peace. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Bush\'s speech and the inspiration of bloody </p><p>Tuesday" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(09/12) editorializes:  "Many observers did not hide </p><p>their conviction that marking the 9/11 anniversary in </p><p>this impressive way, amid heightened military </p><p>conditions, actually befits the condition of current </p><p>U.S. policy, particularly towards Iraq.  We truly hope </p><p>that Washington will listen to reason, and will adopt </p><p>dialogue instead of the language of power that it is </p><p>using.  Beating the American drums of war will lead </p><p>the international community and all anti-war forces to </p><p>intensify their efforts in order to avoid a disaster, </p><p>and to the Arab nation to do everything possible to </p><p>spare Iraq and the region the dangers of a military </p><p>strike." </p><p> </p><p>-- "September 11" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(09/12):  "Why do they hate us?  What is our </p><p>responsibility for what is happening to us?  (these </p><p>are) Two questions that have not yet been answered, </p><p>although a whole year has already passed since the </p><p>`day that changed the world\'.  We enter the second </p><p>year since the attacks amidst the beating of the drums </p><p>of war against Iraq and the turning away from </p><p>international legitimacy.  Meanwhile, we have not </p><p>heard a single word that would suggest self-evaluation </p><p>on the part of the United States." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Times of memory" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mohammad Kawash writes on the back </p><p>page of independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab </p><p>Al-Yawm (09/12):  "The memory of September 11 is going </p><p>to have an especially sad effect on every American, </p><p>because the American people are the ones that have </p><p>lost and have been hurt.  That is why we say that it </p><p>is the American people\'s right to ask their government </p><p>and their leadership: why?  It is the right of the </p><p>Americans to know that their leadership is ruling the </p><p>world but not leading it; that it is a biased and </p><p>unfair administration when it comes to executing its </p><p>policies; that that is why the September disaster </p><p>happened.  We had hoped that the memory of September </p><p>11 would be the beginning of a change that would start </p><p>in Washington." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A media war in another confrontation" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(09/12):  "The unprecedented coverage provided for </p><p>September 11 by the American media established that </p><p>day as a day of `disaster\' in the minds and hearts of </p><p>the American people.  Al-Qa\'eda and Osama Bin Laden, </p><p>too, have not missed this opportunity to underscore </p><p>the confrontation between the United States and the </p><p>Arabs and Muslims.  Watching the political and media </p><p>coverage of the commemoration of September 11 in New </p><p>York shows the negative and bitter effects of the </p><p>attacks on the American people.  World opinion </p><p>understands this, because, even after one year, the </p><p>wound is still fresh.  However, it is dangerous for </p><p>the future of Arab- and Islamic-American relations to </p><p>dedicate the memory of these events in the same way as </p><p>the Holocaust, which Zionism used to keep the struggle </p><p>going in Palestine and to obtain American and European </p><p>support.  If America really wants to assume its </p><p>responsibilities in this world, it must contain this </p><p>loose and vague struggle before it turns into a real </p><p>clash of the civilizations." </p><p>-- "By the way" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Tarek Masarweh writes on the back-page </p><p>of semi-official Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i (09/12): </p><p>"Unfortunately, the earthquake [9/11 attacks] was not </p><p>enough to force American policy to use its brains </p><p>instead of its muscles.  The forces of savage abuse, </p><p>monopoly, and religious and ethnic bigotry jumped on </p><p>the wave and turned this big, rich country into blind </p><p>force.  We see the outcome of that in Palestine, </p><p>Afghanistan and Iraq.  The United States may be the </p><p>strongest power ever known to the world, but no one is </p><p>afraid.  Those who have no faith in their [Arab] </p><p>nation, so much so that they doubt that an Arab could </p><p>do what the Al-Qa\'eda men have done, should believe: </p><p>this nation will never die." </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
