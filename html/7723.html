<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, KDEM, BM, NLD, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: EAP DAS DALEY MEETS WITH AUNG SAN SUU KYI </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA, A.I. RON MCMULLEN, REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  EAP DAS Matt Daley, COM, and note taker </p><p>spent over an hour and a half with Aung San Suu Kyi at her </p><p>residence April 27 discussing a host of political issues.  UN </p><p>Special Envoy Razali\'s influenced was undermined, in the NLD </p><p>leader\'s view, when Malaysian PM Mahathir bowed to the </p><p>regime\'s insistence that he not meet with her during his </p><p>August visit.  The regime\'s harassment of ASSK and </p><p>intimidation of NLD members mounted after her travel to </p><p>ethnic states showed her strong backing there, she continued. </p><p> On national reconciliation, ASSK said the NLD is willing to </p><p>cooperate but not submit, adding, "cooperation can be carried </p><p>just so far, if one side is not interested."  At the close of </p><p>the long and productive meeting she said, "I rely on you to </p><p>take a firm stand--they only respond to pressure."  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) RAZALI PROCESS:  When COM asked if Mahathir\'s upcoming </p><p>retirement had weakened Razali\'s standing with the SPDC, Aung </p><p>San Suu Kyi agreed that much of Razali\'s influence is derived </p><p>from his close relationship with Mahathir.  ASSK added that </p><p>when Mahathir "kowtowed" to Than Shwe during the August visit </p><p>and agreed to cancel a planned meeting with her, "that hurt </p><p>Raz and us.  It was after that that their attitude toward us </p><p>began to harden."  She explained the SPDC thinking as, "If </p><p>Mahathir can be faced down, why bother with Razali?" </p><p>Regarding Razali\'s proposal that ASSK make suggestions to the </p><p>SPDC on humanitarian assistance projects, she added, somewhat </p><p>dismissively, "I\'ve provided suggestions." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION:  ASSK said harassment </p><p>began when her trip to Shan State in November showed she had </p><p>widespread support among Burma\'s ethnic minorities.  She said </p><p>the regime let her travel to Shan State because it gauged she </p><p>had little support there, having only sampled opinion in a </p><p>provincial capital populated by cautious civil servants. </p><p>Outside the provincial capital the crowds were large and </p><p>enthusiastic.  Harassment was bad in Arakan, she said, adding </p><p>that the SPDC orchestrated "systematic harassment to ensure </p><p>my trip would not receive popular support."  It did </p><p>nevertheless.  Intimidation continued in Chin State, although </p><p>the harassment lessened somewhat when the NLD directly called </p><p>the regime on this and asked that it be stopped, she noted. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  The generals often justify four decades of military </p><p>rule by the need to "preserve the Union" from fragmentation </p><p>by ethnic separatists.  Does ASSK\'s support in ethnic areas </p><p>show that the Union could be preserved by democratic means, </p><p>thus jeopardizing the regime\'s self-proclaimed raison d\'etre? </p><p> END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DIALOGUE AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION:  ASSK said the </p><p>generals need to "get out of denial mode."  In Buddhism, she </p><p>reflected, a good man admits his errors, but a wicked man </p><p>does not.  She said the regime leaders "are not good </p><p>Buddhists, having a congenital inability to confront their </p><p>own mistakes and shortcomings."  She said that if the SPDC </p><p>thinks the NLD will put up with continued harassment and </p><p>intimidation for the sake of reconciliation, "they\'re </p><p>mistaken."  "This is blackmail."  She mused, "How much more </p><p>can we do?"  "We are prepared to cooperate but not submit." </p><p>Regarding the lack of progress on dialogue, ASSK noted, "They </p><p>have the responsibility to give more--we are the aggrieved </p><p>party."  She urged the U.S. to maintain its supportive stand, </p><p>saying "if they think you\'re going to act tough, they\'ll back </p><p>down." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) RELATIONS WITH OTHER STATES: ASSK appreciated DAS </p><p>Daley\'s overview of recent developments in Thailand, and </p><p>offered comments on various states\' interactions with Burma. </p><p>She was perhaps toughest on Australia and Japan, saying, </p><p>"They are dishonest and self-deceptive when they say they are </p><p>doing something to help democracy; they are really concerned </p><p>about relations with the regime."  ASSK said that China and </p><p>the ASEAN countries were more straightforward and therefore </p><p>perhaps easier to deal with.  She singled out the ambassador </p><p>of the Philippines as the instigator of an effort to close </p><p>off all contact between her and the ASEAN ambassadors.  She </p><p>admitted having a soft spot for India, explaining that </p><p>India\'s warming with the SPDC was primarily a reaction to </p><p>Chinese inroads in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SANCTIONS, AID:  Regarding any prospective U.S. trade </p><p>ban, ASSK said she intended to stay at arm\'s length from the </p><p>issue, stating, "If it were to happen, it would be much </p><p>better if it comes from you as your own decision."  Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi expressed strong interest in continued financial </p><p>support for Prospect Burma, a scholarship program for Chin </p><p>and other exiles in India.  She asked for two small favors: </p><p>assistance in procuring a low-light camcorder to record </p><p>evening events and incidents on her upcountry travels, and </p><p>help in finding a second-hand Toyota SUV that she could </p><p>purchase.  She also told of a village in Sagaing Division </p><p>threatened by USDA supporters.  The USDA warned that if the </p><p>villagers turned out to cheer ASSK, their village would be </p><p>burned down.  They did and it was.  The NLD is investigating </p><p>this incident.  If in fact the village was torched as </p><p>reported, ASSK said it would be a powerful statement to </p><p>supporters of democracy if this village could be rebuilt </p><p>(stealthily, with NLD and USG help). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Than Shwe\'s "Little Secret Weapon:" Aung San Suu Kyi </p><p>said the regime had intended to turn the Union Solidarity </p><p>Development Association (USDA) into a political party though </p><p>which the generals could continue to run the country, perhaps </p><p>in a more acceptable, quasi-democratic guise.  "I don\'t think </p><p>this will work," ASSK opined.  She said that unlike Ne Win\'s </p><p>socialist party, which was supported by some people on </p><p>ideological grounds, there is no ideology associated with the </p><p>SPDC or the USDA.  It is only patronage and repression that </p><p>keeps the regime together, she said.  Some lower ranking </p><p>military officers are disillusioned and want change, while </p><p>others are awaiting their turn at the trough, she concluded. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  Aung San Suu Kyi, who looked healthy and </p><p>relaxed, was in a talkative, reflective, and strategic </p><p>mood--she was perhaps drawn out by Daley\'s visit.  Somewhat </p><p>uncharacteristically, she thanked him at length for a book he </p><p>had given her on a previous visit, and said she hoped he </p><p>would return soon.  He said he might be back in the region in </p><p>June.  Often visitors see a harried, detail-driven, and </p><p>determined (bordering on stubborn) ASSK, but on this occasion </p><p>she had a broader picture in mind and seemed eager to talk, </p><p>and to listen. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) DAS Daley has cleared this message. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
