TRAN VAN KHUE, </p><p>THE CO-DRAFTER OF A REQUEST TO THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH A "PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION" TO </p><p>HELP FIGHT CORRUPTION.  KHUE AND SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS </p><p>IN HANOI INVOLVED WITH THIS REQUEST WERE RECENTLY </p><p>SUBJECT TO QUESTIONING AND HARASSMENT BY THE POLICE </p><p>(REFTEL).  KHUE HAS NOT BEEN ARRESTED, BUT HAS BEEN </p><p>SUBJECT TO TWICE-DAILY INTERROGATION SESSIONS BY LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES SINCE HIS EXPULSION FROM HANOI ON 5 </p><p>SEPTEMBER.  KHUE\'S PHONE LINE HAS BEEN CUT AND HIS </p><p>COMPUTER CONFISCATED.  HE STATED THAT THE POLICE MAY </p><p>CHARGE HIM WITH ATTEMPTING TO CREATE AN ANTI-GOVERNMENT </p><p>ASSOCIATION.  THE CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE WITHOUT </p><p>INTERFERENCE OR PARTICIPATION BY POLICE, AND ENDED </p><p>AFTER ONE HOUR WHEN KHUE WAS SUMMONED FOR HIS AFTERNOON </p><p>QUESTIONING SESSION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) KHUE TOLD CONGENOFF HE HAD TRAVELED TO HANOI </p><p>FROM HIS HOME IN HCMC ON 22 JULY TO MEET WITH SEVERAL </p><p>OTHER ACTIVISTS WHO REPORTEDLY WERE QUESTIONED BY </p><p>POLICE IN HANOI ON SEPTEMBER 5 IN RELATION TO THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01083  01 OF 02  200353Z </p><p>REQUEST TO FORM A "PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION."  (PRESS </p><p>ACCOUNTS REPORTED THAT POLICE BROUGHT IN AS MANY AS 15 </p><p>PERSONS FOR QUESTIONING REGARDING KHUE\'S LETTER).  KHUE </p><p>IS THE ONLY SOUTHERNER AMONG THEM, ALTHOUGH HE CLAIMS </p><p>THAT "MANY PEOPLE" AT THE SOCIAL SCIENCE INSTITUTE IN </p><p>HCMC WHERE HE FORMERLY WORKED SUPPORT THEIR CAUSE. </p><p>WHEN ASKED ABOUT HOW HE HAD COME TO KNOW THE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS IN HANOI, KHUE WAS VAGUE.  HE STATED THAT </p><p>THEY HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME: "THEY VISIT </p><p>ME, I VISIT THEM."  HE WOULD NOT ELABORATE ON THE </p><p>NUMBER OF PERSONS HE HAD MET WITH IN HANOI GROUP OR </p><p>NAME ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THE SOUTH ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>THE REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  AS REPORTED IN REFTEL, WHILE IN HANOI, KHUE </p><p>AND PHAM QUE DUONG WROTE A REQUEST DATED SEPTEMBER 2 TO </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER, PARTY SECRETARY, AND PRESIDENT FOR </p><p>PERMISSION TO ESTABLISH A "PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION" </p><p>AGAINST CORRUPTION.  KHUE ALSO WROTE A FLIER FOR PUBLIC </p><p>DISTRIBUTION DESCRIBING THE PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION AND </p><p>RECRUITING MEMBERS.  THE FLIER WAS DISTRIBUTED ON </p><p>NATIONAL DAY, 2 SEPTEMBER, IN HANOI AND THE NORTHERN </p><p>PROVINCES, HE SAID, SPECIFICALLY MENTIONING THAI BINH </p><p>AND HAI DUONG PROVINCES.  (NOTE: THAI BINH PROVINCE WAS </p><p>THE SITE OF SIGNIFICANT DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION IN 1997, AND REMAINS A TINDERBOX </p><p>OF SORTS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE.  END NOTE.)  IT IS </p><p>NOT CLEAR HOW MANY OF THE FLIERS WERE DISTRIBUTED OR </p><p>THE EXTENT OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION.  ACCORDING TO KHUE, </p><p>DUONG ALSO POSTED THE REQUEST LETTER ON THE INTERNET AT </p><p>WWW.THONGLUAN.COM.  (CONGENOFFS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01083  01 OF 02  200353Z </p><p>ACCESS THIS SITE.  APPARENTLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>ALREADY BLOCKED IT WITH A FIREWALL.)  KHUE SAID THAT ON </p><p>5 SEPTEMBER, THREE POLICE OFFICERS ESCORTED HIM TO THE </p><p>AIRPORT IN HANOI AND PUT HIM ON A PLANE BACK TO HCMC. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  ACCORDING TO KHUE, WHEN HE ARRIVED BACK IN </p><p>HCMC, THE LOCAL POLICE SEARCHED HIS HOME AND </p><p>CONFISCATED HIS COMPUTER AND THE FLIERS HE HAD BROUGHT </p><p>BACK WITH HIM.  EVERY DAY SINCE 6 SEPTEMBER, THE POLICE </p><p>HAVE COLLECTED HIM AT 8 A.M. AND QUESTIONED HIM UNTIL </p><p>11 A.M., AND AGAIN FROM 3-5 P.M.  THE QUESTIONS FOCUS </p><p>ON HIS PERSONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND THE PURPOSE OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION HE IS ADVOCATING.  KHUE HAS NOT </p><p>HEARD DIRECTLY FROM HIS COMPATRIOTS IN THE NORTH AS HIS </p><p>PHONE LINE HAS BEEN CUT, AND DOES NOT KNOW THEIR </p><p>WHEREABOUTS, OR THOSE OF THE UNNAMED INDIVIDUALS WHO </p><p>DISTRIBUTED THE FLIERS IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCES.  KHUE </p><p>MENTIONED HEARING AN RFI RADIO BROADCAST ON 10 </p><p>SEPTEMBER WHICH REPORTED ON THE INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS </p><p>COMPATRIOTS AND INCLUDED AN INTERVIEW WITH ONE OF "THE </p><p>FOUNDERS" OF THE ASSOCIATION, NGUYEN THANH GIANG.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM "PROVINCES, </p><p>CITIES AND OVERSEAS" IN SUPPORT OF THE ASSOCIATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) CONGENOFF ASKED KHUE WHY THE GOVERNMENT WAS SO </p><p>SUSPICIOUS OF HIM AND HIS PROPOSED ASSOCIATION.  KHUE </p><p>RESPONDED IRONICALLY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS "TO KEEP </p><p>A MONOPOLY ON FIGHTING CORRUPTION."  AND ACCORDING TO </p><p>KHUE, WHILE THE VIETNAMESE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT ANY </p><p>INDIVIDUAL MAY CREATE A REGISTERED ASSOCIATION, THE </p><p>REALITY IS VERY DIFFERENT.  KHUE AND DUONG ALSO </p><p>ADVOCATED FOR AN INDEPENDENT "ANTI-CORRUPTION </p><p>NEWSPAPER" IN THEIR REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) KHUE MAINTAINS THAT HE HAS BEEN WRONGLY </p><p>ACCUSED AND THAT HIS EXPULSION FROM HANOI AND </p><p>INVESTIGATION BY THE POLICE "VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION." </p><p>HE CLAIMS THAT THE POLICE ARE SEEKING TO CHARGE HIM </p><p>WITH WHAT AMOUNTS TO TREASON: THE FOUNDING OF AN ANTI- </p><p>GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION.  HE STATES FURTHER THAT IF HE </p><p>AND THE OTHERS ARE BROUGHT TO TRIAL, THEY WILL "SUE THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY."   BUT KHUE ADDED THAT HE </p><p>BELIEVES THAT IN THE END AUTHORITIES WILL NOT BRING HIM </p><p>AND THE OTHERS TO TRIAL BECAUSE, HE SAID, "WE WILL MAKE </p><p>OUR CASE BEFORE THE PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) THE MEETING TOOK PLACE IN THE BACK OF AN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01083  02 OF 02  200353Z </p><p>ADVERTISING AGENCY RUN BY HIS NEPHEW ON A BUSY </p><p>COMMERCIAL STREET IN HCMC\'S DISTRICT FIVE.  DURING THE </p><p>MEETING HIS SON CAME INTO THE BACK ROOM AND ASKED HIS </p><p>FATHER IF IT WAS SAFE FOR HIM TO BE TALKING TO US. </p><p>KHUE ASSURED HIM IT WAS.  THE MEETING ENDED AFTER ONE </p><p>HOUR WITH THE ARRIVAL OF A LOCAL UNIFORMED POLICE </p><p>OFFICER WHO SMILED AND SHOOK KHUE\'S HAND.  BEHIND THE </p><p>OFFICER WERE TWO MEN IN PLAINCLOTHES.  KHUE INFORMED </p><p>CONGENOFF THAT HE WOULD NOW BE RETURNING TO THE POLICE </p><p>STATION FOR QUESTIONING. </p><p> </p><p>BIONOTE </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) KHUE WAS PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN TO CONGEN.  HE </p><p>WORKED AT THE SOCIAL SCIENCES INSTITUTE IN HCMC AS A </p><p>RESEARCHER UNTIL HE RETIRED IN 1996.  DURING THE </p><p>MEETING HE BROUGHT OUT ONE OF THE BOOKS HE HAS </p><p>AUTHORED, A COLLECTION OF CULTURAL ESSAYS PUBLISHED IN </p><p>1996.  KHUE STUDIED THE HUMANITIES AT THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>UNIVERSITY IN HANOI AND GRADUATED IN 1955.  PRIOR TO </p><p>WORKING AT THE SOCIAL SCIENCES INSTITUTE, HE TAUGHT AT </p><p>THE PEDAGOGICAL COLLEGE IN HCMC.  KHUE WAS QUIETLY </p><p>INTENSE DURING THE MEETING, ANSWERING CONGENOFF\'S </p><p>QUESTIONS BUT NOT MAKING ANY STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT OF </p><p>THE QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) COMMENT: KHUE\'S IDEAS SEEM TO POST TO BE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01083  02 OF 02  200353Z </p><p>REFORMIST, RATHER THAN RADICAL.  IN VIETNAM, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE MANNER IN WHICH PERSONS EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS IS </p><p>AS IMPORTANT AS THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED.  KHUE\'S ACTIONS </p><p>- HIS REQUEST TO ESTABLISH A "PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION" AND </p><p>THE DISTRIBUTION OF FLIERS RECRUITING SUPPORT IN </p><p>SENSITIVE PROVINCES ON VIETNAM\'S NATIONAL DAY - </p><p>APPARENTLY HAVE TESTED THE LIMITS OF OFFICIAL </p><p>TOLERANCE. </p><p> </p><p>WHITE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
