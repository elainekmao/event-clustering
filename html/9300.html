<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004194 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>USDOC FOR IRAQ TASKFORCE </p><p>USTR FOR SAUMS </p><p>TREASURY FOR DEMOPULOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, BEXP, KIPR, JO, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: PHRMA GROUP FORMS TO SUPPORT IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  A group of Amman-based reps of </p><p>multinational pharmaceutical companies, facilitated by </p><p>the regional office of Pharmaceutical Research and </p><p>Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), is forming a working </p><p>group to provide recommendations to Iraqi authorities on </p><p>establishing a pharmaceutical regime.  These major, </p><p>innovative companies, which have mainly been shut out of </p><p>the Iraqi market for over a decade, have substantial </p><p>experience and resources that could be brought to bear on </p><p>some of the difficult issues Iraq\'s health sector faces. </p><p>The embassy will remain engaged with the group as their </p><p>work progresses.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Following a July 6 conference call with CPA </p><p>advisor to the Iraq Ministry of Health Shaun Stevens, a </p><p>group of Amman-based representatives of multinational </p><p>pharmaceutical companies agreed to form a working group. </p><p>The group, which will try to include CPA reps </p><p>electronically, will endeavor to provide recommendations </p><p>to Iraqi authorities as they devise new procedures for </p><p>the import and distribution of pharmaceutical products. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The company reps explained that as U.S. and UK </p><p>companies most of them had been excluded from Oil for </p><p>Food program contracts with Iraq for the past decade. </p><p>The Iraqis mainly procured generic products from Russia, </p><p>China and other countries that were perceived as </p><p>politically supportive of the regime and from companies </p><p>ready to pay "commissions."  Thus, their companies and </p><p>products, which are the most modern and innovative, are </p><p>for the most part not included on lists of drugs Kimadia </p><p>(the Health Ministry\'s procurement arm) had purchased </p><p>over the past decade.  They had also lost contact with </p><p>Kimadia officials.  Their companies\' main interest is in </p><p>working with Kimadia to restore what they believe is </p><p>their natural share of the Iraqi drug market, as they say </p><p>they enjoyed pre-sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  They understand that this is a medium term </p><p>objective and that a necessary part of restoring their </p><p>access is establishment of an Iraqi legal and regulatory </p><p>regime for pharmaceutical products that covers issues </p><p>like intellectual property protection, drug registration, </p><p>pricing, and distribution.  They also understood that the </p><p>immediate task of CPA is to examine pending OFF contracts </p><p>and to wind down the program.  In the meantime, the group </p><p>will begin meeting and working to develop their ideas. </p><p>One of the members noted, for example, that Jordan\'s IPR </p><p>laws could provide a model for Iraqi laws.  They would </p><p>welcome participation as possible by Kimadia reps, </p><p>through visits to Amman or electronically. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  In the shorter term, the group will also </p><p>discuss with Kimadia and the WHO the status of the </p><p>relatively few pending OFF contracts their companies </p><p>hold.  They noted that they have also received requests </p><p>from Iraqi private sector companies interested in </p><p>distributing their products in Iraq.  Stevens, however, </p><p>said Iraqi policy would probably be to work directly with </p><p>the companies rather than through middlemen. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment:  This seems to be an excellent, constructive </p><p>private sector initiative that will benefit both the </p><p>companies and the creation of a health system in Iraq. </p><p>One rep noted that among the group there was 250 years of </p><p>collective experience in the pharmaceutical business in </p><p>the region.  PhRMA should also be able to bring its </p><p>financial and other resources to bear on some of the </p><p>difficult issues the Iraqi health sector faces.  Amman </p><p>appears to be the natural locus for this activity since </p><p>many PhRMA members base their regional operations in </p><p>Amman or in nearby Beirut or Damascus.  The embassy will </p><p>work with the group as its activities develop.  As </p><p>suggested during the conference call, it could be very </p><p>useful at the right time for Kimadia reps to travel to </p><p>Amman to meet the group.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The call was facilitated by the regional PhRMA </p><p>rep Samir Mansour, Embassy Amman\'s Economic Section, and </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance Coordinating Center (HACC) Amman </p><p>reps.  Regional representatives of Bristol Myers Squib, </p><p>Schering Plough, Pfizer, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Wyeth, </p><p>Glaxo Smith Kline, Schering AG, and Boehringer Ingelheim </p><p>participated in the call and subsequent meeting.  Mansour </p><p>will coordinate future activities of the group on behalf </p><p>of PhRMA. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
