<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 010188 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: HESSE SPD CHOOSES GERHARD BOEKEL TO CHALLENGE </p><p>MINISTER-PRESIDENT KOCH FOR FEBRUARY 2003 STATE ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  The Hesse SPD voted overwhelmingly on </p><p>October 19 for Gerhard Boekel to challenge Minister- </p><p>President Roland Koch (CDU) in the February 2003 state </p><p>elections.  Boekel, a 56-year-old lawyer and former Hesse </p><p>Interior Minister, is admired for his integrity and his good </p><p>management and team-building abilities.  Hesse state </p><p>elections are important in Germany next year and could be a </p><p>barometer for the national CDU\'s future chances in 2006 </p><p>elections.  (Minister President Koch is widely discussed as </p><p>a CDU chancellor candidate for 2006.)  While polls rate </p><p>Boekel more trustworthy and likeable than Koch, they also </p><p>show Boekel is still a relative unknown to over half the </p><p>voters in the state.  Chancellor Schroeder\'s failure to </p><p>appear at the Hesse state SPD convention to support Boekel </p><p>was viewed by many as a snub.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Overwhelming Delegate Support for Boekel </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) At its October 19 convention in Wiesbaden, the Hesse </p><p>SPD voted overwhelmingly for Gerhard Boekel to challenge </p><p>Hesse Minister-President Roland Koch (CDU) in the February </p><p>2, 2003 state elections.  After his 90-minute speech, 99 </p><p>percent of the delegates supported Boekel, the best result </p><p>ever for an SPD candidate.  In his speech, Boekel described </p><p>improving education and reduction of youth unemployment as </p><p>key issues for his administration.  He expressed clear </p><p>preference for an SPD-Green Party coalition.  (Frankfurt </p><p>airport expansion is the only major controversial issue </p><p>between the two parties).  The Hesse SPD electoral list was </p><p>accepted without major changes.  It had been vetted in </p><p>advance to balance the northern and southern districts of </p><p>the party. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The 56-year-old Boekel was a controversial choice </p><p>at first but has managed to unite the party behind him in </p><p>recent months.  Hesse SPD delegates emphasized to us </p><p>Boekel\'s integrity and team-building ability.  They believe </p><p>these qualities will help him against the incumbent.  (NOTE: </p><p>In polls, Hesse M-P Koch, CDU, ranks low among German </p><p>politicians in the area of trustworthiness and credibility. </p><p>Koch has had to shake off a campaign finance scandal in the </p><p>past.  But he is admired by many for his energy and </p><p>strategic thinking and is frequently discussed as a CDU </p><p>chancellor candidate for national elections in 2006.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  Hesse SPD delegates were optimistic after a major </p><p>poll (Infratest Dimap) showed that Boekel is considered more </p><p>likeable than Koch and that Koch rates lower then previously </p><p>assumed in several areas of competence.  Boekel\'s biggest </p><p>obstacle is that he is still a relative unknown among the </p><p>general population in Hesse: only four out of ten people are </p><p>familiar with the former Interior Minister. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) One sour note at the Hesse SPD event was the </p><p>failure of Chancellor Schroeder to appear.  The Chancellor </p><p>cancelled his appearance at the convention at the last </p><p>minute with a not-very-convincing excuse, much to the dismay </p><p>of Hesse party officials.  His absence was seen by some as </p><p>displeasure with Boekel\'s candidacy.  Schroeder had </p><p>reportedly favored Offenbach Lord Mayor (Oberbuergermeister) </p><p>Grandke but was unable to push his candidate through. </p><p>Schroeder\'s failure to appear generated a lot of talk on the </p><p>margins and tension among the party delegates.  It was </p><p>viewed by many as a deliberate snub. </p><p> </p><p>Biographic Information on Boekel </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) B1oekel studied law at the University of Giessen. </p><p>In 1978, he was elected into the Hesse Landtag (state </p><p>parliament) and remained a member until his election in 1985 </p><p>as county executive advisor (Landrat) of Lahn-Dill county. </p><p>Boekel served in that position until 1994.  Boekel was </p><p>appointed Hesse\'s Interior Minister in July 1994 and served </p><p>until 1999.  In 2001 Boekel was also appointed Hesse SPD </p><p>party chairman succeeding Hans Eichel (former Hesse Minister- </p><p>President, now federal Finance Minister).  The center-right </p><p>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper has described Boe2 </p><p>kel as "an active administrator with managerial qualities." </p><p>Boe3kel characterizes himself as a pragmatic politician of </p><p>the center.  His sympathies are generally considered to lie </p><p>with the right wing of the SPD.  As county executive, he </p><p>refused to enter into an SPD-Green Party coalition, </p><p>preferring more conservative and independent voter groups. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) As Hesse Interior Minister, Boe4kel stoutly defended </p><p>Hesse SPD policies by temporarily halting deportations of </p><p>Kurdish asylum seekers.  He was also cautious regarding the </p><p>return of Bosnian refugees.  His performance as minister </p><p>enjoyed support from all parties and his centrist approach </p><p>comes across well with unaffiliated voters too.  Since </p><p>assuming a dominating role in the Hesse SPD, Boekel has </p><p>begun a number of initiatives to sharpen his party\'s </p><p>profile.  One example is his outspoken and early support to </p><p>create a network of "all day" schools.  He also decided to </p><p>abandon the months-long battle over the CDU state party </p><p>financing scandal.  Boekel felt that the SPD was not gaining </p><p>ground with the issue, Hesse politics had been brought to a </p><p>near standstill by it, and that the focus needed to shift </p><p>back to more substantive matters. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Roland Koch was barely known in Hesse when he was </p><p>nominated to run against Hans Eichel in 1999.  This has </p><p>given hope to the SPD, which has still not recovered from </p><p>its election defeat in the last state elections.  The Hesse </p><p>state elections are the most important in Germany next year. </p><p>Not only might the CDU lose its majority in the Bundesrat if </p><p>Boekel wins, but Koch\'s career may suffer a serious setback. </p><p>For this reason, one might have expected  Chancellor </p><p>Schroeder to show interest in giving Boekel a good show of </p><p>support.  The Hesse SPD was certainly disappointed with </p><p>Schroeder\'s failure to appear.  In any case, Boekel has a </p><p>lot of heavy campaigning to do to build his image and ensure </p><p>an election victory.  The Hesse SPD is fully behind him now. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p>8.  This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p>_______________________________ </p><p>1 </p><p>2 </p><p>3 </p><p>4 </p><p></p></div>
