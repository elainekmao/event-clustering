<p>UNCLAS KADUNA 1207 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  ECON, EIND, ELAB, EPET, EAGR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NORTHERN NIGERIA ECONOMIC QUARTERLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY.  PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW GOVERMENT\'S </p><p>POLICIES REMAINS TENTATIVE IN THE NORTH.  MOST CONSUMER </p><p>GOODS ARE IN GOOD SUPPLY, AND PRICES ARE GENERALLY LOWER </p><p>THAN A YEAR AGO.  DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING RAW MATERIALS </p><p>HAS LED TO PLANT CLOSURES TEMPORARILY IDLING MANY WORKERS, </p><p>BUT EMPLOYMENT LEVELS GENERALLY HAVE REMAINED STEADY.  THE </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PICTURE IS STILL BRIGHT, ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF </p><p>FACTORS MAY REDUCE THE HOPED-FOR RECORD HARVEST.  WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF A BRIEF WALKOUT AT THE KADUNA PEUGEOT PLANT, </p><p>THE LABOR SCENE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY QUITE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THIS IS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF QUARTERLY ECONOMIC </p><p>REPORTS AIMED AT GAUGING PUBLIC REACTION TO THE BABANGIDA </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND THE ECONOMY\'S RESPONSE TO ITS POLICIES. </p><p>THIS INITIAL REPORT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON KADUNA, BUT </p><p>FUTURE REPORTS WILL INCLUDE THE ENTIRE NORTH AND THE SCOPE </p><p>WILL BE BROADENED TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC </p><p>INDICATORS AND REACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p>THE GENERAL PUBLIC CONTINUES TO TAKE A WAIT AND SEE </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD THE BABANGIDA GOVERNMENT\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICIES.  KADUNA\'S NEW GOVERNOR SEEMS KEENLY AWARE OF THE </p><p>DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVENOTS, AND THE </p><p>BASIC ECONOMIC NEEDS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC SERTAIN TO </p><p>BE A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHAT FUTURE ROAD TO </p><p>FOLLOW.  WHILE POPULAR SENTIMENT HAD TURNED AGAINST THE </p><p>FMG IN THE LATTER STAGES OF THE BUHARI REGIME, THE PUBLIC </p><p>SEEMS WILLING TO GIVE THE NEW GOVERNMENT THE BENEFIT OF </p><p>THE DOUBT.  EVEN THE RECENT BANNING OF RICE AND MAIZE </p><p>IMPORTS, A MOVE WHICH COULD CAUSE HARDSHIP FOR SOME </p><p>PEOPLE, HAS RAISED NO PUBLIC OUTCRY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MARKET SURVEY </p><p> </p><p>--AVAILABILITY OF GOODS:  MOST CONSUMER ITEMS ARE IN </p><p>GOOD SUPPLY IN KADUNA.  AUTOMOBILE SPARE PARTS ARE </p><p>OCCASIONALLY AT A PREMIUM, BUT THE SITUATION IS MUCH </p><p>IMPROVED FROM A YEAR AGO.  TIRES THEN AVAILABLE FOR NAIRA </p><p>300 (APPROX. USDOL 330) CAN NOW BE FOUND FOR LESS THAN </p><p>NAIRA 100.  PETROLEUM PRODUCTS WERE BRIEFLY SCARCE DURING </p><p>THE FIRST WEEK OF OCTOBER, EVIDENTLY DUE TO PANIC BUYING </p><p>WHEN THE PUBLIC LEARNED THAT THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL </p><p>PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC) REFINERY WOULD BE CLOSING </p><p>TEMPORARILY FOR ITS REGULAR ANNUAL MAINTENANCE. </p><p>DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SOLVED, AND THE </p><p>SITUATION HAS RETURNED TO NORMAL.  THE EXPECTED GOOD </p><p>HARVEST SHOULD KEEP FOOD SUPPLIES PLENTIFUL IN THE </p><p>MARKETPLACE. </p><p> </p><p>--PRICES:  PRICES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN LAST YEAR </p><p>FOR MOST ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES, AGAIN REFLECTING THE GOOD </p><p>HARVEST.  GRAIN PRODUCTS ARE SELLING AT PRICES 25 TO 50 </p><p>PERCENT BELOW LAST OCTOBER\'S LEVELS.  PRICES, HOWEVER, ARE </p><p>SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION DUE TO A VARIETY OF CHANGING </p><p>ECONOMIC FACTORS.  THE PRICE OF RICE MORE THAN DOUBLED IN </p><p>KADUNA\'S CENTRAL MARKET AFTER THE OCTOBER 1ST ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>THAT IMPORTATION WOULD BE BANNED, BUT MAIZE PRICES REMAIN </p><p>STEADY EVEN THOUGH ITS IMPORTATION HS ALSO BEEN BANNED. </p><p>GROUNDNUT OIL PRICES JUMPED AFTER PRESS REPORTS THAT A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CROP WILL BE LOST TO ROSETTE </p><p>DISEASE.  HERE IN KADUNA, BEAN PRICES ALSO HAVE LEAPED </p><p>DURING THE PAST TWO WEEKS, EVIDENTLY DUE TO HEAVY INSECT </p><p>INFION ON LOCAL FARMS.  PRICES FOR NON-FOOD ITEMS, </p><p>SUCH AS LAUNDRY DETERGENT, ARE AS MUCH AS 25 PERCENT LESS </p><p>THAN 1984 LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  EMPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p>THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE PEUGEOT ASSEMBLY PLANT IN </p><p>AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER WAS THE MAJOR EMPLOYMENT NEWS IN </p><p>KADUNA RECENTLY.  THE SIX WEEKS OF FORCED LEAVE IDLED MORE </p><p>THAN 4,000 WORKERS, BUT THE PLANT HAS NOW RESUMED </p><p>PRODUCTION.  DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING RAW MATERIALS FROM </p><p>ABROAD CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM FOR MAJOR INDUSTRIAL </p><p>CONCERNS IN THE NORTH.  PRESS REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THE </p><p>STEYR TRUCK PLANT IN BAUCHI MAY ALSO SOON BE FORCED TO </p><p>CLOSE TEMPORARILY FOR THE SAME REASON.  NO MAJOR </p><p>RETRENCHMENT EXERCISES HAVE OCCURRED RECENTLY.  THE NEW </p><p>STATE GOVERNORS HAVE TALKED ABOUT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF </p><p>CIVIL SERVANTS, BUT THEY HAVE ALSO PROPOSED SETTING UP </p><p>ALTERNATE EMPLOYMENT SCHEMES, PRIMARILY FARMING PROJECTS, </p><p>TO ABSORB THE DISPLACED GOVERNMENT WORKERS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AGRICULTURE </p><p> </p><p>RAINS THROUGHOUT THE NORTH HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT THIS YEAR, </p><p>BUT EARLIER PREDICTIONS FOR A BUMPER HARVEST MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>PREMATURE.  WHILE CROP PRODUCTION WILL CERTAINLY BE BETTER </p><p>THAN MOST PREVIOUS YEARS, A NUMBER OF FACTORS WILL REDUCE </p><p>HOPED-FOR RECORD CROPS.  IRONICALLY, FLOODING CAUSED BY </p><p>TOO MUCH RAIN IN AREAS HIT LAST YEAR BY DROUGHT HAS </p><p>DESTROYED MANY CROPS, AND PEST INFESTATION AND DISEASE </p><p>HAVE STRUCK ELSEWHERE.  ONCE THE HARVEST IS IN, STORAGE </p><p>AND DISTRIBUTION SEEM LIKELY TO BECOME PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  NEW INDUSTRY </p><p> </p><p>UNIPETROL WILL BE INAUGURATING A NEW MOTOR OIL/LUBRICANT </p><p>FACILITY IN KADUNA ON OCTOBER 15.  THE PLANT, LOCATED ON </p><p>THE NNPC REFINERY COMPLEX, IS HIGHLY AUTOMATED WITH </p><p>LARGELY FRENCH-MADE EQUIPMENT.  IT WILL SUPPLY OILS AND </p><p>LUBRICANTS FOR MUCH OF THE NORTH, GETTING VOST OF ITS RAW </p><p>MATERIALS DIRECTLY FROM THE REFINERY; SOME ADDITIVES WILL </p><p>BE IMPORTED FROM FRANCE.  THE FACILITY WILL ADD ONLY ABOUT </p><p>20 JO LOCAL EMPLOYMENT ROLLS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  LABOR </p><p> </p><p>THE LABOR SCENE GENERALLY HAS BEEN QUITE IN THE NORTH. </p><p>THE ONLY NOTABLE RUMBLINGS WERE AT KADUNA\'S PEUGEOT </p><p>ASSEMBLY PLANT OCTOBER 4 WHEN WORKERS WALKED OUT AFTER </p><p>LEARNING OF COMPANY PLANS TO DEDUCT 15 DAYS\' PAY FROM </p><p>UPCOMING MONTHLY SALARIES TO MAKE UP FOR DAYS LOST DURING </p><p>THE SIX WEEKS OF FORCED LEAVE IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LEE </p><p></p></div>
