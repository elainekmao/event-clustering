ROME 01646 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02148  01 OF 02  151708Z </p><p>     B. ROME 01664 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER, </p><p>REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY: EMBASSY OFFICERS MET ON MAY 13 WITH </p><p>AMBASSADOR ANTONIO ARMELLINI, WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF </p><p>ITALY\'S CIVILIAN AND MILITARY PERSONNEL AS SPECIAL ENVOY IN </p><p>IRAQ AND REPRESENTATIVE TO THE INTERIM AUTHORITY (REFS A, B). </p><p> ARMELLINI RETURNED FROM BAGHDAD LAST WEEK HAVING RECEIVED, </p><p>HE SAID, A CLEAR APPEAL FROM ORHA FOR SWIFT ITALIAN </p><p>MOBILIZATION OF A TEAM OF TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL EXPERTS TO </p><p>INTEGRATE WITH ORHA AND IRAQ\'S EMERGING MINISTRIES. </p><p>ARMELLINI PLANS TO TRAVEL ALONE TO WASHINGTON ON MAY 18 TO </p><p>SECURE CLEAR ASSURANCES THAT THE TEAM THAT THE GOI IS </p><p>MOBILIZING MEETS USG NEEDS.  ARMELLINI SAID THAT HIS TEAM OF </p><p>ABOUT 40 PEOPLE COULD BE DISPATCHED WITHIN THE NEXT TWO </p><p>WEEKS.  HE SHARES OUR CONCERN THAT ITALIAN COORDINATION WITH </p><p>CENTCOM IMPROVE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  ECMIN BEGAN THE MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR ARMELLINI BY </p><p>STRESSING THE FACT THAT IRAQ REMAINS A MILITARY ZONE, AND, AS </p><p>SUCH, COORDINATION WITH CENTCOM THROUGH THE GOI\'S LNO, </p><p>GENERAL SANTINI, REMAINS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.  ECMIN </p><p>DESCRIBED HOW THE EMBASSY\'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SECTIONS </p><p>ARE ARRAYED ON IRAQ ISSUES, AND REVIEWED FOR ARMELLINI </p><p>VARIOUS CONDUITS FOR INFORMATION, INCLUDING WASHINGTON </p><p>BRIEFINGS, THE IMMINENT FORMATION OF THE HIGH LEVEL IRAQ </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION VIRTUAL WORKING GROUP, AND THE PUBLIC </p><p>INFORMATION PACKETS THAT THE EMBASSY HAS PLACED ON ITS WEB </p><p>SITE FOR PROSPECTIVE ITALIAN SUBCONTRACTORS AND DONORS OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02148  01 OF 02  151708Z </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.  ON THE POLICY SIDE, ECMIN NOTED </p><p>THAT WE COUNTED ON ITALIAN SUPPORT FOR THE LIFTING OF </p><p>SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ AS A PREREQUISITE FOR THE MEDIUM AND </p><p>LONGER-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF THE IRAQI ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  ARMELLINI RESPONDED WITH THANKS FOR THIS INFORMATION, </p><p>ADDING THAT THE FLOW OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THE MFA AND THE </p><p>ITALIAN EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON WAS EXCELLENT.  HE WENT ON TO </p><p>DESCRIBE HIS ROLE AS BEING THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MFA IRAQ </p><p>TASK FORCE ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ, COMMUTING BACK AND FORTH TO </p><p>THE REGION AS NEEDED.  ARMELLINI DESCRIBED AS "UNPRECEDENTED" </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE THAT PM BERLUSCONI HAS GIVEN TO ITALY\'S "FULL </p><p>PARTICIPATION" ACROSS THE RANGE OF TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL </p><p>REQUIREMENTS THAT ORHA HAS IDENTIFIED.  HE REPORTED THAT THE </p><p>GOI WAS FINALIZING THE IDENTIFICATION OF A 30-40 PERSON TEAM </p><p>TO SEND TO THE REGION IN THE COMING WEEKS.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>GOI WAS EAGER TO BE PART OF A DEMONSTRABLY SUCCESSFUL, </p><p>COLLECTIVE EFFORT IN IRAQ AND WANTS TO LEVERAGE ITALY\'S </p><p>STRONG HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE REGION.  THE GOI, </p><p>ARMELLINI ASSURED, WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE LOGISTICAL NEEDS OF </p><p>ITS TEAM. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  HAVING WITNESSED OUR SHORT-LIVED NEED FOR ITALY\'S </p><p>FIELD HOSPITAL AND OUR RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW COALITION </p><p>LEADERSHIP IN IRAQ, ARMELLINI WAS CONCERNED THAT, JUST AS THE </p><p>GOI BEGINS AN UNPRECEDENTED MOBILIZATION, USG  PRIORITIES MAY </p><p>SHIFT.   HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT\'S APPOINTMENT OF </p><p>AMBASSADOR BREMER AS THE SENIOR COALITION OFFICIAL IN IRAQ </p><p>AND SPECIFICALLY WHETHER HE WOULD BE ARMELLINI\'S NEW </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR.  ECMIN UNDERSCORED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD </p><p>CLEARLY PRONOUNCED AMBASSADOR BREMER\'S AUTHORITY IN IRAQ.  HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02148  01 OF 02  151708Z </p><p>ALSO AFFIRMED THAT ARMELLINI COULD EXPECT TO ENGAGE WITH </p><p>BREMER AT A POLITICAL LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  ECMIN ASKED HOW ARMELLINI PLANNED TO ORGANIZE ON THE </p><p>GROUND.  ARMELLINI REPLIED THAT HE WOULD HAVE OVERALL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WHOLE ITALIAN MISSION IN IRAQ, </p><p>INCLUDING CIVILIAN AND MILITARY PERSONNEL.  GENERAL CABIGIOSU </p><p>(PENDING CONFIRMATION) IS EXPECTED TO ACT AS HIS MILITARY </p><p>ADVISOR.  UNDER ARMELLINI\'S LEADERSHIP, A COMMANDER WOULD </p><p>HAVE OPERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITALIAN TROOPS IN IRAQ AS </p><p>WELL AS MILITARY-TO-MILITARY LIAISON WITH THE BRITISH IN </p><p>BASRA. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  ECMIN RETURNED TO THE NEED TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION </p><p>WITH CENTCOM, AND ARMELLINI NOTED THAT HE SHARED THE SAME </p><p>CONCERN.  HE POINTED OUT THAT, DESPITE GETTING CLEARANCE FOR </p><p>HIS LAST TRIP TO BAGHDAD, WORD HAD NOT YET REACHED BAGHDAD BY </p><p>THE TIME HE ARRIVED.  ARMELLINI ASKED WHETHER THE PROBLEM WAS </p><p>THE COMPLEX ROUTING OF INFORMATION OR WHETHER ADEQUATE </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS HAD YET TO BE SET UP.  HE NOTED THAT GETTING </p><p>COORDINATION RIGHT WITH CENTCOM WAS A PRIORITY FOR GENERAL </p><p>CABIGIOSU. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5355 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02148  02 OF 02  151708Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------65B33A  151708Z /45 </p><p>O 151601Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9917 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY KUWAIT IMMEDIATE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE IMMEDIATE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 002148 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, IZ, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S NEW IRAQ ENVOY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02148  02 OF 02  151708Z </p><p>7. (C)  COMMENT:  ARMELLINI IS FOCUSED ON HOW TO PUT A TEAM </p><p>TOGETHER THAT MEETS USG NEEDS IN IRAQ, WHILE MAKING THE MOST </p><p>OF ITALY\'S COMPARATIVE STRENGTHS.
