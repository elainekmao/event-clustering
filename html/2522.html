<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000622 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR DAS PERRY, AF/W FOR BOOTH FROM JETER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, LI, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: LIBERIA: JOHNSON SIRLEAF BELIEVES LURD THREAT IS </p><p>REAL, BUT EXAGGERATED: SEES LIBERIA RECONCILIATION MEETING </p><p>IN MID-MARCH </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) PERRY/JETER 2/21 EMAIL </p><p>     B. B) ABUJA 507 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. During a February 22 meeting at my residence, </p><p>Liberian opposition leader Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (EJS) told </p><p>me the security situation in Liberia was difficult to read. </p><p>While acknowledging the LURD\'s ability to disrupt and raid </p><p>areas closer to Monrovia, she did not think the rebel group </p><p>was sufficiently strong to hold territory, much less capture </p><p>Monrovia, at least not in the short-term. Yet, for divergent </p><p>reasons, the LURD exaggerated its strength, while Taylor </p><p>inflated the threat in order to gain sympathy </p><p>internationally, muzzle dissent and detain suspected fifth </p><p>columnists at home. EJS characterized the LURD as an </p><p>approximate reincarnation of ULIMO-J and ULIMO-K, both </p><p>containing hard-line elements no less preoccupied by power </p><p>than the incumbent they sought to oust. To stave off a future </p><p>battle of attrition for Monrovia, EJS thought an all Liberian </p><p>reconciliation conference, that included the GOL and LURD, </p><p>was essential. During her previous night\'s conversation with </p><p>President Obasanjo and ECOWAS ExecSec Chambas, it was agreed </p><p>to convene the meeting on March 14-15 in Abuja. Chambas </p><p>planned to fly to Monrovia and Dakar by the end of the month </p><p>for consultations with Taylor and ECOWAS Chairman Wade before </p><p>making a public announcement about convening the meeting. </p><p>Obasanjo said he would personally extend an invitation to </p><p>Taylor for the meeting, also letting Taylor know that his </p><p>non-attendance would be seen as a personal affront. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>THE FIGHTING IN LIBERIA -- MORE BARK THAN BITE? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  ESJ said it was difficult to assess the extent of the </p><p>fighting and to accurately gauge the threat the LURD posed to </p><p>the Taylor Government. Due to a combination of fiction, fraud </p><p>and fear, both sides -- the LURD and the Government of </p><p>Liberia -- as well as many Liberians were exaggerating the </p><p>military state of play. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  In the realm of fiction, the LURD claimed victories </p><p>and troop strength beyond its means. In the realm of fear, </p><p>the devastation visited on the city during the civil war made </p><p>Monrovia\'s collective psyche very fragile.  There was a sense </p><p>of gloom that Liberia was set to repeat the cycle of violence </p><p>that brought Taylor to power. Rekindling these old nightmares </p><p>was the sight of Liberians fleeing to Monrovia from western </p><p>Liberia just as people once flooded the capital when Taylor </p><p>began his rebellion twelve years ago. Despite Taylor\'s </p><p>legendary braggadocio, his government often operated out of </p><p>fear if not outright paranoia. Thus, Taylor was overreacting </p><p>to the LURD threat to Monrovia and his government.  Implying </p><p>the state of emergency was unnecessary, ESJ claimed that </p><p>Taylor was using the situation to detain and harass hundreds </p><p>of young men with no connection to the LURD.  Fraudulently, </p><p>Taylor\'s security agents were further exploiting this ploy, </p><p>turning it into a new extortion racket by refusing to release </p><p>detainees unless relatives paid hefty ransoms for their </p><p>freedom.  While LURD operatives were in Monrovia, they were </p><p>too weak and too few to militarily threaten Taylor, she </p><p>maintained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>WHAT IS THE LURD? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) When I asked about the leadership of the LURD, Ellen </p><p>stated she did not know LURD Commander Konneh and some of the </p><p>others who claim to command the group\'s front-line fighters. </p><p>However, Konneh\'s recent public statements to the media where </p><p>he demonstrated much more political ambition than acumen were </p><p>troubling.  According to ESJ, the LURD was basically ULIMO </p><p>reincarnated. As such, it was split along Krahn/Mandingo </p><p>lines, with the Mandingo and Lofa County-born elements based </p><p>mainly in Guinea and the Krahn in Sierra Leone. There were </p><p>various sub-factions and tendencies within each group. ESJ </p><p>claimed Alhaji Kromah was passing himself off as the leader </p><p>of the Mandingo wing, but his power did not extend beyond his </p><p>ability to manipulate the international media. While many of </p><p>his former lieutenants were active in the LURD, they no </p><p>longer owed their primary loyalty to Kromah. However, Kromah </p><p>symbolized a troubling element in the LURD. Labeling Kromah </p><p>no more a democrat than Taylor, she felt there were other </p><p>Mandingo hot-heads who wanted to seize power as well. If </p><p>Kromah or another Mandingo hard-liner emerged, a LURD </p><p>government would be little better than Taylor\'s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ellen mentioned there were moderates in the </p><p>Mandingo/Lofa camp who realized most Liberians were not ready </p><p>to see "foreign" Mandingos take the helm. These moderates </p><p>seemed willing to discuss a broad-based interim government </p><p>and elections. ESF included non-Mandingos such as Former </p><p>Taylor Justice Minister Laveli Supuwood and Abidjan-based </p><p>former Interior Minister Soko Sackor in this group of </p><p>moderates.  Giving the impression that she was in contact </p><p>with these two and others, EJS intimated that discussions </p><p>about drafting the venerable Rudolph Grimes to head an </p><p>interim government to prepare for elections had taken place. </p><p>In that Grimes was old, honest and without Presidential </p><p>ambition, all sides could more readily trust him to run </p><p>things fairly and not stay in office beyond his allotted </p><p>time. However, she feared these moderates in the political </p><p>wing did not have the influence over the younger military </p><p>commanders they might think. If the LURD achieved military </p><p>victory, the commanders, after tasting power and success, </p><p>could not be trusted to hand over to the politicians who had </p><p>been watching the fighting from the sidelines. "We have been </p><p>down that road  before," she noted. ( Comment: ESJ was </p><p>alluding to how Taylor ignored his political sponsors, </p><p>including Ellen herself, when he hijacked undisputed </p><p>leadership of the NPFL years ago. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  With regard to the Krahn element in the LURD, EJS did </p><p>not have much contact or knowledge of the key players but </p><p>suspected that Roosevelt Johnson, who now resided in Nigeria, </p><p>might still wield influence.  She believed most of the Krahns </p><p>were Doe-era die-hards nostalgic for a return of that Krahn </p><p>heyday. While the Mandingos received support from President </p><p>Conte, ESF did not think  President Kabbah was helping the </p><p>Sierra Leone-based Krahn. However, the Krahn were getting </p><p>help and some recruits from the CDF and Kamajors. Ellen also </p><p>thought disenchanted elements of the AFL were abetting the </p><p>LURD because Taylor was not paying them and was otherwise </p><p>ignoring their welfare in favor of his Anti-Terrorism Unit </p><p>(ATU). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ESJ dismissed GOL claims that former Senator and </p><p>Taylor ally Charles Brumskine was involved with the LURD. The </p><p>GOL was simply trying to tarnish Brumskine because he had the </p><p>temerity to challenge Taylor for the NPP\'s Presidential </p><p>nomination. Taylor brooked no opposition, and to a certain </p><p>degree, could not help but lump together in his mind </p><p>Brumskine\'s political challenge with the LURD\'s military one. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>TAYLOR -- HE WILL RUN AWAY IF HE HAS TO </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ultimately, the best thing for Liberia would be for </p><p>Taylor to leave office. Saying Taylor had proven himself </p><p>incapable of governing, EJS contended that Taylor\'s persona </p><p>was one that could only thrive on chaos; thus, as long as he </p><p>was in power, he would burden his people and would be a drag </p><p>on the entire sub-region. "We all must work together to </p><p>provide an exit for him," was Johnson-Sirleaf\'s solution. </p><p>Taylor could not live in Liberia without being in power </p><p>because his ambition and paranoia would prevent him from </p><p>retiring peacefully to the Liberian countryside. After I </p><p>disabused her of the notion that the U.S. might provide haven </p><p>for Taylor,  ESJ mentioned Morocco as a potential exile, </p><p>given that Morocco was arranging a Mano River Summit at </p><p>France\'s urging. Because of the favorable French connection, </p><p>Taylor might be amenable to a permanent Moroccan vacation. </p><p>Closer to home, the only country in the sub-region that could </p><p>serve as an a place of exile and keep Taylor sufficiently </p><p>under wraps would be Nigeria.  However, she acknowledged </p><p>Taylor did not feel comfortable here and would think an </p><p>invitation to live in Nigeria might be a trap to imprison him </p><p>later. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Because of Taylor\'s addiction to power and money, </p><p>Ellen did not think he would leave office quietly or quickly, </p><p>although she had been told that Taylor was moving his most </p><p>prized possessions from other parts of the country to </p><p>Monrovia should a quick exit become necessary. Yet, the </p><p>current level of difficulties were not enough to uproot him. </p><p>Stating that he would leave if there were no other </p><p>alternative, ESJ did not think Taylor would replicate Doe, </p><p>hanging on even after the last hope had vanished. However, </p><p>Taylor\'s stubbornness and willingness to fight nearly to the </p><p>end could spell doom for Monrovia if the LURD ever mustered </p><p>the firepower for a bona fide assault against the capital. </p><p>She predicted a terrible battle of attrition and urban </p><p>warfare. If Taylor felt the tide was against him that he had </p><p>to retreat, he would want to destroy as much of the city as </p><p>possible, believing if he could not have it no one should. If </p><p>this happened, the all-out battle for Monrovia would be a </p><p>humanitarian disaster. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  EJS also discounted the possibility of major </p><p>defections within  the Taylor government despite the current </p><p>difficulties. Senior officials remained loyal out of fear. </p><p>While thinking an open rupture within the government </p><p>unlikely, she foresaw some officials finding ways to go </p><p>overseas for "government business" then prolonging their </p><p>stays until the dust settled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>SIERRA LEONE AND REGIONAL LEADERS VIEWS ON TAYLOR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) As long as Taylor remained in power, the stability of </p><p>Sierra Leone would be threatened.  Ellen said Taylor was </p><p>getting help from the RUF, who would stand beside him if </p><p>Monrovia came under serious attack. RUF support not only </p><p>bolstered Taylor\'s security; it maintained his role in Sierra </p><p>Leone. The strategy of Taylor and the hard-core RUF was to </p><p>wait out the international community\'s presence in Sierra </p><p>Leone. The RUF would bide its time until the UN packed its </p><p>bags. Once the blue helmets departed, the RUF, supported by </p><p>Taylor, would begin to wreak havoc once more. Ellen hoped it </p><p>would be harder for Taylor to execute his strategy this time </p><p>around because some key friends were pulling away from him. </p><p>Not wanting to be tagged with the "terrorist" stigma after </p><p>September 11, both Tripoli and Ouagadougou were distancing </p><p>themselves from Monrovia, with Campaore now even in the </p><p>anti-Taylor camp. (Note: Ellen said that Obasanjo was of the </p><p>same view regarding Campaore after a recent Abuja meeting </p><p>with the Burkinabe leader. End Note.)  However, claiming that </p><p>a recent clandestine shipment of arms to Taylor emanated from </p><p>either Bamako or Lome, Ellen noted that both the Malian </p><p>President and Togolese strongman appeared to be inching </p><p>closer to Taylor, probably for financial reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Because many of the players in the Sierra Leonean </p><p>equation -- the RUF, CDF and Kamajors -- were being swept </p><p>into the Liberian mix, a collapse in Liberia could have dire </p><p>consequences for Sierra Leone, including the possibility of </p><p>rekindling the war in that country if Monrovia came under </p><p>siege. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>RECONCILIATION CONFERENCE -- THE TIME HAS COME </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)  Due to the high political anxiety the LURD presence </p><p>was now causing, the reconciliation conference was needed now </p><p>more than before, ESF suggested. ( Ellen commented that many </p><p>Monrovians were leaving and senior GOL officials were sending </p><p>their families out of the city.)  Previous planning called </p><p>for the conference to be focused on the creation of </p><p>conditions for fair elections. Participants would have been </p><p>the GOL, opposition parties, and civil society, with the LURD </p><p>ultimately brought into the process down the line to preclude </p><p>them from citing their exclusion as a reason to continue </p><p>fighting. However, Taylor characteristically vacillated over </p><p>the idea of holding the conference. When he finally turned </p><p>against it (Ref B), Taylor paid members of the Coalition of </p><p>Political Parties, most notably the TWP\'s Rudolph Sherman, to </p><p>endorse his idea of a conference in Monrovia in July. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  Because Taylor would control the Monrovia venue, EJS </p><p>dismissed its utility, claiming that Taylor conceived it in </p><p>hopes of short-circuiting efforts to hold the Abuja </p><p>conference. However, during her February 21 meeting with </p><p>President Obasanjo and ECOWAS ExecSec Chambas, the three </p><p>agreed to convene an all Liberian meeting in Abuja on March </p><p>14-15. President Obasanjo said not only would he personally </p><p>invite Taylor but would let the Liberian know that his </p><p>non-attendance would be considered a personal affront. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.(C) Asserting that it was too late to draw the LURD in </p><p>gradually, Ellen said the LURD leadership would be invited to </p><p>this initial meeting. LURD attendance would give ECOWAS the </p><p>opportunity to unambiguously tell the faction\'s leaders that </p><p>they would face regional and international opprobrium unless </p><p>they committed to free elections according to the </p><p>constitutional timetable, i.e. 2003, notwithstanding the </p><p>situation on the ground militarily. However, ESF feared that, </p><p>during the interim between now and the conference, the LURD </p><p>might become emboldened and recalcitrant should it somehow </p><p>manage a significant military victory.  To get Taylor\'s </p><p>buy-in for the meeting, Chambas would fly to Monrovia before </p><p>the end of the month to discuss the conference with Taylor, </p><p>who would not assent if the meeting were announced before </p><p>being discussed with him. The date of the conference would be </p><p>publicly announced soon after Chambas talked with Taylor. </p><p>ESJ stated that Obasanjo and Chambas had agreed, nonetheless, </p><p>that the conference would take place with or without Taylor\'s </p><p>participation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) EJS was very open and shared her views freely. While </p><p>fairly confident the conference will take place, she is less </p><p>sanguine about Taylor\'s participation and the ultimate </p><p>success of the endeavor. However, given Liberia\'s slump </p><p>toward increased fighting, the conference may be the best, </p><p>albeit uncertain, diplomatic tool available to arrest the </p><p>current course. Yet, if Taylor or his minions attend, they </p><p>will likely fill the hall with empty promises without the </p><p>intention of fulfilling any but the most inconsequential of </p><p>these commitments. Ellen is convinced that Taylor is </p><p>incorrigible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17  (C) For Johnson-Sirleaf, the true purpose of the </p><p>conference seems to have shifted from pressuring Taylor to </p><p>hold fair elections to using the venue to apply pressure on </p><p>the LURD to restrain their political ambitions to fit within </p><p>a more democratic game-plan.  Perhaps she thinks this </p><p>approach provides the best chance to fashion the combined </p><p>political/military pressure, an effective one-two punch, that </p><p>will lead to her real objective -- the creation of a </p><p>democratic opening that both removes Taylor yet, at the same </p><p>time, prevents a similar personality from taking over. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
