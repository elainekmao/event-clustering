<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 005695 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (DEBORAH MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 195/00 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/31/11 </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: VT, PREL IS, Human Trafficking </p><p>SUBJECT: POPE TELLS ARAFAT TO CONTAIN VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR R.J. NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(A) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) DCM AND POLOFF CALLED ON VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05695  021715Z </p><p>MINISTER CELESTINO MIGLIORE, OCTOBER 31.  THE PURPOSE OF </p><p>THE CALL WAS TO DISCUSS ON GOING EMBASSY ANTI-TRAFFICKING </p><p>PROJECTS (SEPTEL) AND PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY CHAIR YASSAR </p><p>ARAFAT\'S OCTOBER 30 MEETING WITH THE POPE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MIGLIORE SAID THAT AT THIS 11TH VISIT WITH THE </p><p>POPE (HE JOKED ABOUT THE FREQUENCY WHICH ARAFAT COMES TO </p><p>THE VATICAN), NOTHING NEW WAS DISCUSSED.  MIGLIORE DID </p><p>SAY THAT THE POPE TRIED TO IMPRESS UPON ARAFAT THE NEED </p><p>FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO CONTROL THE PALESTINIAN MILITANTS </p><p>AND TO END THE VIOLENCE.  MIGLIORE ALSO VOLUNTEERED THE </p><p>VATICAN VIEW THAT DESPITE SUGGESTIONS ARAFAT IS LOSING </p><p>HIS GRIP AND CANNOT CONTROL THE MILITANTS, ARAFAT, IN </p><p>FACT, IS STILL "POWERFUL" AND CAN CONTROL THE MILITANTS </p><p>"WHEN HE WANTS TO". </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT:  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE VATICAN </p><p>HAS STRESSED TO THE MISSION ITS URGING OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS TO END THE VIOLENCE, AS OPPOSED TO ITS </p><p>SYMPATHY FOR THE SUFFERING OF THE PALESTINIANS IN FACE OF </p><p>ISRAELI ACTIONS.  THIS COULD BE A SUBTLE SHIFT ON THE </p><p>PART OF THE VATICAN INDICATING A MORE BALANCED VIEW. </p><p>CORROBORATING THIS SUPPOSITION IS A REPORT GIVEN TO DCM </p><p>BY HIS ISRAELI COUNTERPART, ZVI TAL (PROTECT).  ACCORDING </p><p>TO TAL, THE PAPAL NUNCIO IN ISRAEL WAS RECENTLY </p><p>REPRIMANDED BY THE VATICAN FOR TAKING PART IN A </p><p>PALESTINIAN ORGANIZED PEACE MARCH.
