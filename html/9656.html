<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 002120 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR PLEASE PASS TO BUREAU OF INDIAN </p><p>AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CA </p><p>SUBJECT:  CANADA\'S FIRST NATIONS ELECT A NEW GRAND CHIEF; </p><p>PATH OPEN FOR A RENEWED DIALOGUE WITH OTTAWA </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Canada\'s Assembly of First Nations (AFN) met </p><p>for their 24th annual meeting on July 15-17 and elected Phil </p><p>Fontaine to a three-year term as National Grand Chief. </p><p>Chief Fontaine, a self-described conciliator, brings a less </p><p>confrontational style than his predecessor, Matthew Coon </p><p>Come, to First Nation relations with the federal government. </p><p>He is, however, on record as opposing the First Nations </p><p>Governance Act, one of three First Nations bills currently </p><p>under consideration by Parliament.  Some politicians, and </p><p>even some aboriginals themselves, have recently questioned </p><p>whether the AFN adequately represents aboriginal people to </p><p>the government of Canada (GOC).  The election of a more </p><p>conciliatory Grand Chief, and the prospect of a new Prime </p><p>Minister, who may be more willing to listen to the concerns </p><p>of the AFN, will augur for an improved dialogue between </p><p>Ottawa and the First Nations. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2.  Canada\'s Assembly of First Nations (AFN) met for their </p><p>24th General Assembly July 15-17.  Phil Fontaine defeated </p><p>incumbent Matthew Coon Come to reassume, after a three-year </p><p>interim, the position of National Grand Chief.  The AFN, </p><p>viewed by its members as a type of parliamentary gathering, </p><p>is comprised of the 633 First Nation chiefs, each of whom </p><p>represent a tribe or band.  It is comprised of status First </p><p>Nation chiefs, who represent some 650,000 - 700,000 "status" </p><p>natives, but critics claim it represents the chiefs </p><p>themselves (some of whose positions are hereditary) more </p><p>than the First Nation rank and file.  The GOC does not </p><p>recognize the First Nations as a separate nation, but rather </p><p>as another "order of government" like the provinces.  Order </p><p>of government is used instead of level of government (which </p><p>refers to provinces and municipalities) in order to avoid a </p><p>connotation of hierarchy. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In the past, Minister Robert Nault of the Department of </p><p>Indian Affairs described the AFN as ineffective and </p><p>irrelevant, and "structurally incapable of working with the </p><p>government."  Many observers describe the AFN as more as a </p><p>lobby group than an effective legislative body, and in the </p><p>campaign Fontaine rued the fact that the AFN had been </p><p>"marginalized" and had been made of "little or no </p><p>consequence to Ottawa."  Dwindling attendance at the annual </p><p>meetings has become a problem, as it is becoming a problem </p><p>for the Assembly, as the rank-and-file perceived they were </p><p>no longer being represented. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Three candidates ran for the position Grand National </p><p>Chief:  Roberta Jamieson (a lawyer and First Nation civil </p><p>rights advocate), Matthew Coon Come (the incumbent Grand </p><p>Chief), and Phil Fontaine, who had served as Grand Chief </p><p>prior to the election of Coon Come in 2000.  Mr. Coon Come, </p><p>whose confrontational negotiating style was said to have </p><p>repeatedly alienated federal officials, was dropped after </p><p>the first ballot when he only earned 18 percent of the vote. </p><p>Fontaine won the election in the second round with 292 of </p><p>550 votes, edging out Ms. Jamieson, who had positioned </p><p>herself midway between her two rivals.  Phil Fontaine </p><p>campaigned on the promise to work with the government, </p><p>instead of alienating it with "noisy rhetoric," but has </p><p>declared his opposition to the First Nations Governance Act, </p><p>Bill C-7, which is an important piece of legislation </p><p>currently before Parliament.  Our contacts in the Department </p><p>of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) are </p><p>complimentary regarding Mr. Fontaine\'s abilities, but say it </p><p>is premature to comment on how his election would affect the </p><p>substance of GOC-AFN relations, particularly regarding the </p><p>possible passage and implementation of C-7. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Minister for Indian Affairs Nault introduced the First </p><p>Nations Governance Initiative in 2001 as a way to modernize </p><p>the Indian Act of 1867, and provide first nations people </p><p>with better governance.  It is meant to make native </p><p>leadership more accountable, and to open up the voting </p><p>process to aboriginals living off of the reserves.  While </p><p>many of the chiefs in the Assembly are opposed to Bill C-7, </p><p>the First Nations Governance Act, federal officials claim it </p><p>is an important, long-overdue piece of legislation which </p><p>will permit natives to improve their quality of life.  Other </p><p>critics go farther and suggest that the chiefs\' opposition </p><p>is based on a desire to protect inappropriate privileges and </p><p>powers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  During his campaign, Fontaine acknowledged the need for </p><p>changes in First Nation affairs, but he called Bill C-7 </p><p>regressive.  He sees poverty as the underlying cause for </p><p>many of the problems the First Nations face.  It stands to </p><p>reason that the AFN would not support the legislation; many </p><p>Assembly representatives see their role and status as being </p><p>threatened by the law, which would essentially disband the </p><p>Assembly in favor of an allegedly more effective group.  The </p><p>Director of International Affairs at the AFN told the </p><p>embassy that the real issue behind the bill is not </p><p>accountability of the chiefs, but the need for self- </p><p>governance.  According to this view, most chiefs do not have </p><p>problems with accountability and, in fact, spend much of </p><p>their time writing reports and keeping others aware of their </p><p>actions.  Many within First Nation communities see the bill </p><p>as a continuance of assimilation policies they oppose, </p><p>saying it imposes non-native cultural structures onto native </p><p>groups.  At the same time, they are tired of not having a </p><p>say in how their governments operate.  To remedy this, the </p><p>AFN proposed the First Nations Plan, an internal initiative </p><p>that would review the structure of the AFN, voting, and </p><p>other First Nation governmental issues without GOC </p><p>involvement. </p><p>7.  Paul Martin, who is expected to become the Liberal </p><p>Party\'s leader in November and Prime Minister shortly </p><p>thereafter, has his own reservations regarding Bill C-7.  He </p><p>received wide praise among native leaders for blocking the </p><p>passage of the bill this spring by filibustering in </p><p>committee.  He does not want it to proceed without further </p><p>consultation with the First Nations.  Martin stated that the </p><p>proposed legislation "severely poisoned the well of federal- </p><p>aboriginal relations," noting that the government, in </p><p>pushing ahead with the legislation despite an AFN boycott </p><p>announced in 2001, had created a quagmire."  (Note: Bill C-7 </p><p>is considered a part of the so-called "legacy legislation" </p><p>of the outgoing Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, himself a </p><p>former Minister of Indian Affairs, who may recommend quick </p><p>passage when Parliament returns to work in September.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  Comment:  The AFN is a diverse and unwieldy group, not </p><p>surprising given Canada\'s huge geographical expanse, its </p><p>propensity for regional political discord, and the varying </p><p>governance structures currently in place among its First </p><p>Nations.  The Assembly is essentially a lobby group whose </p><p>prestige rises and falls with its ability to influence </p><p>policy.  Much of the recent decline is attributed to former </p><p>AFN Chief Matthew Coon Come whose acerbic style alienated </p><p>potential allies within the Department of Indian Affairs. </p><p>The Department delivered a strong signal last year when it </p><p>cut the AFN\'s GOC-derived funding in half, ostensibly </p><p>because of his inability to work effectively with the GOC. </p><p>Martin, the Prime Minister-in-waiting has not only earned </p><p>the AFN\'s gratitude by questioning C-7 and announcing that </p><p>would seek equal representation for the AFN in all federal- </p><p>provincial meetings, but he has also reflected a </p><p>conciliatory, consultative management style.  The stage is </p><p>set for a renewed dialogue, even though some tension will </p><p>likely remain. </p><p></p></div>
