(C) SUMMARY.  THE TWO TOP OFFICIALS OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION (ESC) BRIEFED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS ON THE MORNING OF MARCH </p><p>6 ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE MARCH 9 AND 10 VOTE.  IN A </p><p>SURREAL NINETY-MINUTE SPEECH, THE RECENTLY APPOINTED </p><p>NUMBER TWO OF THE ESC, A PRO-ZANU-PF BRIGADIER, PAINTED </p><p>A ROSY PICTURE OF ELECTION READINESS AND DUCKED KEY </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LOCATION OF POLLING PLACES, WHAT </p><p>LOCAL OBSERVERS WILL BE ACCREDITED, AND EXACTLY WHAT </p><p>ELECTORAL RULES ARE IN FORCE.  WITH LESS THAN SEVENTY- </p><p>TWO HOURS BEFORE THE POLLS OPEN, THE GOZ STALL STRATEGY </p><p>HAS EFFECTIVELY ENSURED THAT ELECTION-DAY </p><p>DISORGANIZATION AND UNCERTAINTY WILL REIGN.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION COMMISSIONER:  "IT\'S NOT OUR FAULT!" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (SBU) ESC COMMISSIONER GULA-NDEBELE KICKED OFF THE </p><p>PRE-ELECTION BRIEFING WITH A SHORT SPEECH THAT STRESSED </p><p>THAT THE ESC ONLY SUPERVISES ELECTIONS, AND THAT THE </p><p>REGISTRAR GENERAL IS FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SMOOTH </p><p>COMPORTMENT OF THE VOTE.  WITH THIS HOT-POTATO IN THE </p><p>AIR, GULA-NDEBELE MADE SOME VAGUE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES CONTESTING THE ELECTION "PERCEIVE" -- </p><p>HE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS WAS NOT NECESSARILY SO -- THAT </p><p>NGOS ARE PARTISAN.  THIS HAD FORCED THE ESC TO SEARCH </p><p>FOR NON-PARTISAN GROUPS TO ACT AS OBSERVERS.  HE </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT SINCE ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES MISTRUST </p><p>THE BONA FIDES OF CIVIL SERVANTS, THIS MAKES THEM THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00591  01 OF 02  061559Z </p><p>LOGICAL CHOICE TO SERVE AS MONITORS. </p><p> </p><p>THE BRIGADIER DECLAIMS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) NEXT IN LINE WAS THE ESC DEPUTY COMMISSIONER </p><p>NYIKAYARAMBA, AN ERSTWHILE ZDF BRIGADIER WHO RETIRED TWO </p><p>MONTHS PAST TO ASSUME HIS PRESENT ROLE.  THE BRIGADIER </p><p>GOT OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT WITH SEVERAL DELEGATIONS BY </p><p>ANNOUNCING THAT ALL AFRICAN CHIEFS OF MISSION AND THE </p><p>HEADS OF OBSERVER GROUPS, AFRICAN ONLY, WERE INVITED TO </p><p>A FOLLOW-ON SESSION IN AN ADJACENT MEETING HALL AS SOON </p><p>AS THE CURRENT MEETING HAD ENDED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) NYIKAYARAMBA PRAISED OBSERVERS AS THE "EYES AND </p><p>EARS" OF THE ESC, AND THEN PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN WHY THE </p><p>ESC WILL BE LARGELY BLIND AND DEAF ON ELECTION DAY.  HE </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF THE ELECTION WAS LAND </p><p>INEQUITY AND THEN DESCRIBED AT LENGTH ELEVEN COMPETING </p><p>PARTIES, INCLUDING SEVERAL OF WHICH WE WERE UNAWARE. </p><p>THE BRIGADIER THEN MADE A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS THAT WE </p><p>WOULD CHARACTERIZE AS INACCURATE, FOR WANT OF A BETTER </p><p>WORD.  TO WIT: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POLLING STATIONS HAS EXPANDED </p><p>FROM 3,904 FOR THE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS TO 4,548 </p><p>IN 2002.  NYIKAYARAMBA DID NOT ADDRESS WHY PRO-MDC </p><p>(OPPOSITION) URBAN AREAS HAVE LOST LARGE NUMBERS OF </p><p>POLLING STATIONS, ALTHOUGH AN ESCA HANDOUT DID STATE </p><p>THAT PRO-ZANU-PF (MUGABE) RURAL AREAS HAVE RECEIVED </p><p>ADDITIONAL STATIONS "TO SHORTEN WALKING DISTANCES."  IT </p><p>HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO CONFIRM THE ACTUAL NUMBERS, SINCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00591  01 OF 02  061559Z </p><p>THE ESC HAS NOT YET RELEASED THE OFFICIAL LIST OF </p><p>POLLING STATIONS, ALTHOUGH -- TWO DAYS OUT -- </p><p>NYIKAYARAMBA ASSURED THAT THIS IS IN THE WORKS. </p><p> </p><p>-- REQUESTING WILLING SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF ON THE </p><p>PART OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, NYIKAYARAMBA STATED </p><p>THAT THE ESC SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A FULLY INDEPENDENT </p><p>ELECTORAL COMMISSION FULFILLING INTERNATIONAL NORMS.  HE </p><p>DID NOT ADDRESS THE NEED FOR PRESIDENTIAL CONFIRMATION </p><p>OF THE MAJORITY OF MEMBERS, HIS OWN RECENT APPOINTMENT, </p><p>NOR THE UTTER LACK OF OPPOSITION REPRESENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- NYIKAYARAMBA STATED THAT THE ESC HAS ACCREDITED 566 </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND LISTED THESE BY GROUP AND </p><p>NATIONALITY.  HE TOOK SOME POETIC LICENSE IN THIS </p><p>EXERCISE, CITING 45 JAPANESE OBSERVERS (THERE ARE FIVE), </p><p>29 U.S. (25), 28 NIGERIAN (12), ETC.  IN ADDITION, HE </p><p>LISTED EU BILATERAL DIPLOMATS WHO HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO BE </p><p>ACCREDITED, THE LOCAL EU COMMUNITY HAVING FINALLY MADE </p><p>COMMON CAUSE WHEN EU OBSERVER MISSION HEAD PIERRE </p><p>SCHORRI WAS EXPELLED AND THE EU DELEGATION FOLLOWED ON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9491 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00591  02 OF 02  061559Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  WHA-00   DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      M-00     NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    EPAE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------705F18  061559Z /38 </p><p>O 061552Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1118 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000591 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, A/S KANSTEINER AND PDAS BELLAMY; ALSO FOR </p><p>AF/S </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/04 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWEAN ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE SETS </p><p>         THE STAGE FOR THE VOTE, ZANU-PF STYPE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00591  02 OF 02  061559Z </p><p>HIS HEELS. </p><p> </p><p>-- NYIKAYARAMBA SAID THAT THE ESC HAS ALREADY SUCCEEDED </p><p>IN ACCREDITING 23 LOCAL OBSERVERS, INCLUDING NINE </p><p>PERSONS AFFILIATED WITH THE PRO-ZANU-PF RUMP TRADE UNION </p><p>HEADED BY WAR VETERAN LEADER JOSEPH CHINOTIMBA.  NONE OF </p><p>THE 14,000 TRAINED ZIMBABWE ELECTION SUPPORT NETWORK </p><p>FIGURED ON THIS LIST.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUERY, </p><p>NYIKAYARAMBA REPLIED THAT HE COULD ONLY ACCREDIT THOSE </p><p>INVITED BY THE JUSTICE MINISTER, ANOTHER HOT POTATO IN </p><p>THE AIR.  (NOTE: IN THE TWO DAYS REMAINING, THE ESC\'S </p><p>TWO COMPUTERS DEDICATED TO PRODUCING CREDENTIAL BADGES </p><p>ARE CAPABLE OF ISSUING 2,000 BADGES, USING THE </p><p>OPTIMISTIC FIGURE OF ONE ISSUED PER MINUTE.  IN A </p><p>CLASSIC CATCH 22, THE ZESN FOLK MAY EITHER WAIT IN </p><p>HARARE FOR CREDENTIALS, AND MISS THE ELECTIONS, OR </p><p>DEPLOY TO THE PROVINCES WITHOUT CREDENTIALS NEEDED TO </p><p>LET THEM OBSERVE EFFECTIVELY.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>-- NYIKAYARAMBA GOT HIS BIGGEST TITTER WHEN HE ANNOUNCED </p><p>THAT THE ESC DEPLORES POLITICALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE AND </p><p>IS "CARRYING OUT INVESTIGATIONS OF ISOLATED INCIDENTS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE." </p><p> </p><p>-- NYIKAYARAMBA ANNOUNCED THAT ELECTION OBSERVERS MAY </p><p>SEEK COPIES OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE ELECTORAL ACT </p><p>FROM THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS.  HE DID NOT </p><p>REFER TO THE MARCH 1 GAZETTING OF THE AMENDED ELECTORAL </p><p>ACT OF JANUARY 2002, WHICH WAS STRICKEN DOWN LAST WEEK </p><p>BY THE SUPREME COURT, ONLY TO BE REINTRODUCED AND </p><p>GAZETTED AS THE LAW IN FORCE BY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00591  02 OF 02  061559Z </p><p> </p><p>-- THE BRIGADIER SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN 5.4 MILLION </p><p>REGISTERED VOTERS AT THE TIME OF THE DECEMBER 27 CUTOFF </p><p>DATE.  HOWEVER, IN A QUEST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY </p><p>QUALIFIED ZIMBABWEAN WAS ABLE TO VOTE, REGISTRATION HAD </p><p>BEEN REOPENED AND LATECOMERS WOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE FROM </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL LISTS.  HE DID NOT COMMENT ON REPORTS THAT </p><p>REGISTRATION HAS CONTINUED IN RURAL, TRADITIONALLY PRO- </p><p>ZANU-PF AREAS BUT NOT IN THE MDC\'S URBAN STRONGHOLDS. </p><p> </p><p>Q AND A SESSION </p><p>--------------- </p><p>5.  (C) AFTER DEMONSTRATING A MOCK-UP POLLING STATION </p><p>AND HOW VOTING IS DONE IN ZIMBABWE, THE ESC FIELDED </p><p>QUESTIONS.  WHEN ASKED WHEN THEY WOULD PUBLISH THE LIST </p><p>OF POLLING PLACES, THEY STATED THAT IT WOULD BE PRINTED </p><p>IN THE NEWSPAPERS, ALTHOUGH THEY COULD NOT SAY EXACTLY </p><p>WHEN.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHEN LISTS OF DOMESTIC OBSERVERS </p><p>WOULD BE RELEASED, THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW, </p><p>BUT WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE THIS UP WITH THE JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE REDUCTION OF POLLING </p><p>STATIONS IN URBAN AREAS AND THE NUMBER OF VOTERS EACH </p><p>COULD PROCESS PER HOUR, THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY DID NOT </p><p>HAVE THESE STATISTICS IN HAND.  HOWEVER, THE OBSERVERS </p><p>SHOULD REST ASSURED THAT THE GOZ HAS AMPLE EXPERIENCE </p><p>WITH SUCH MATTERS, AND CAN EXTEND VOTING HOURS, IF IT </p><p>COMES TO THAT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (C) THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS ILL EQUIPPED WITH POLITE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00591  02 OF 02  061559Z </p><p>ADJECTIVES TO FULLY DESCRIBE THE BRIEFING SESSION, </p><p>ALTHOUGH OUTRAGEOUS, MIND-BOGGLING, AND DEPLORABLE DO </p><p>SPRING TO MIND.  THE ESC HAS PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN </p><p>THE GOZ\'S STALLING TACTICS, AN EFFECTIVE REARGUARD </p><p>ACTION THAT, IT WOULD APPEAR, HAS MANAGED TO KEEP THE </p><p>LARGE CONTINGENT OF DOMESTIC OBSERVERS OFF THE FIELD. </p><p>AT THIS POINT, TO MIX METAPHORS, THE ESC HAS SET THE </p><p>ELECTORAL STAGE TO THE INCUMBENT\'S ADVANTAGE AND </p><p>DELIVERED THE OFFICIAL ESC LINE.  ALL THAT REMAINS TO BE </p><p>SEEN IS WHETHER OR NOT THE ZIMBABWEAN ELECTORATE HAS </p><p>BEEN SUFFICIENTLY COWED TO PLAY OUT ITS DESIGNATED PART </p><p>IN THE FINAL SCENE OF THE ZANU-PF SCRIPT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
