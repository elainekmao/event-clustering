<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000187 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y( CORRECTING DECL AND REASON) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEP FOR EB/ESC/ESP, S/CT, AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, ECON, ETTC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: (S) NINTH TERRORIST LIST: NASCO GROUP (NIGERIA) </p><p>LIMITED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 10592 </p><p>     B. STATE 11652 </p><p>     C. LAGOS 144 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reason 1.6X6 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary:  The question of including the NASCO Group </p><p>(Nigeria) Ltd AND other NASCO SUBSIDIARIES IN NIGERIA in the </p><p>assets freeze is a question of balancing our national </p><p>security interests in confronting terrorism and its many </p><p>components against our interests in Nigeria and the resultant </p><p>strain the designation of the NASCO subsidiaries would have </p><p>on the bilateral relationship. The national security </p><p>imperative against counter terrorism is of paramount </p><p>importance and that effort must not be found wanting. </p><p>However, pursuit of this objective in a given situation, may </p><p>undercut other important objectives and interests we may have </p><p>in a particular country. This is the case with Nigeria and </p><p>NASCO.  The Mission does not know the extent to which NASCO\'s </p><p>Nigerian operations contribute to the global network of </p><p>terrorism; Nor are we arguing that the NASCO group should not </p><p>be placed on the list. If NASCO has abetted terrorism, it </p><p>should pay the price for that affiliation. However, we would </p><p>like to make Washington aware of the potential reaction in </p><p>Nigeria to such a move and to the effect it might have on our </p><p>relations here. If NASCO is added, the public disclosure of </p><p>corroborative evidence would go far in reducing the </p><p>inevitable criticism of our move. Additionaly, we offer other </p><p>thoughts in paras 13 and 14 below on how the NASCO Group link </p><p>with terrorism could be severed, but in ways that would tend </p><p>to reduce the fallout inimical to the US-GON bilateral </p><p>relationship. These ideas include the proposal that any </p><p>freezes ordered should be limited to the NASCO parent company </p><p>in Turkey, not the Nigerian subsidiaries.  (Reftel C was </p><p>transmitted in error and should be disregarded.) End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Ref A includes (29) NASCO Group (Nigeria) Limited, the </p><p>holding company for twelve NASCO companies (30-41), the </p><p>majority of which manufacture consumer products and are </p><p>co-located in a large industrial complex located on a </p><p>one-kilometer stretch of Yakubu Gowon Way, Old Airport Road </p><p>Junction, Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. Telephone numbers </p><p>(234)73-463-175, (234)73-463-347 and facsimile </p><p>(234)73-461-554.  Group President and Managing Director is </p><p>Mr. Attia A. Nasreddin.  Muslim owned NASCO is the largest </p><p>private employer in Plateau State and one of the largest </p><p>private employers in mostly-Muslim northern Nigeria.  NASCO </p><p>is a functioning industrial enterprise that meets the real </p><p>needs of the Nigerian consumer, even as much of Nigeria\'s </p><p>industrial plant is moribund or operating at under 30% of </p><p>installed capacity. .  A huge industrial complex with </p><p>distribution centers across the country, NASCO Group sources </p><p>95 percent of its industrial inputs locally, directly employs </p><p>over 1500 Nigerians and indirectly sustains the employment of </p><p>10,000 to 12,000 additional people.  We estimate that, </p><p>including family members, between 80,000 and 125,000 persons </p><p>would lose their major source of income if NASCO were shut </p><p>down. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) NASCO began operations in Nigeria in 1963 as carpet </p><p>and blanket maker Northern Nigeria Fiber Products Limited. </p><p>NASCO has since expanded into seven manufacturing companies </p><p>(NASCO Fibre Products Limited, PolyFibre Industry Limited, </p><p>NASCO Foods Nigeria Limited, NASCO Household Products </p><p>Limited, NASCO Beauty Care Products, NASCO Pack Limited and </p><p>NASCO Confectionery Company Limited), one marketing company </p><p>(NASCO Marketing Company Limited), one service company (NASCO </p><p>Management Service Limited), one trading company (NASCO </p><p>Trade) and one land development company (NASCO Property and </p><p>Investment Company Limited). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) Ref A notes (35) NASCO Rice & Cereals Company </p><p>Limited, for which Post has no reference.  Descriptions of </p><p>the NASCO companies follow: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--(31) NASCO Fibre Products manufactures three types of </p><p>carpets, two sizes of blankets, jute twine, jute cloth and </p><p>jute sacks.  According to company information found on the </p><p>internet, NASCO Fibre Products also produces car components </p><p>such as floor mats, molded carpets, wheel archlining and roof </p><p>felt carpets for Peugeot Automobile and ANAMMCO (a bus and </p><p>truck assembler with links to DaimlerChrysler). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--(40) NASCO Polyfibre Industries Limited produces polyfiber </p><p>and yarn for industrial use. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--(32) NASCO Food (Nigeria) Limited sources good quality </p><p>grains from Nigerian farmers.  These grains are processed </p><p>into finished products, including twenty types of biscuits, </p><p>five types of wafers and cornflakes.  The number of farmers </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y (CORRECTING DECL AND REASON) </p><p>indirectly employed by this company is not known.  However, </p><p>it is likely that hundreds of small and medium-size farms </p><p>located near Jos supply products to NASCO.  These farms would </p><p>employ or support thousands of low-income Nigerians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--(33) NASCO Household Products Limited, established in 1973, </p><p>produces soaps, detergent powder, hair care products, </p><p>glycerine and other industrial chemicals, such as sulfonic </p><p>acid and textile auxiliaries.  This company sells to </p><p>industrial consumers in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (39) NASCO Beauty Care Products started production in 1994 </p><p>and produces petroleum jelly, three types of shampoo, hair </p><p>lotion, hair curl activator, hair conditioner, body cream and </p><p>body lotion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (36) NASCO Confectionery Company (Nigeria) Limited, </p><p>acquired by NASCO in 1985, produces sweets, toffees, jellies </p><p>and bubble gum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (34) NASCO Pack Limited manufactures and sells packaging </p><p>materials, including multi-color labels and cartons, </p><p>cellophane, transwrap film, polythene bags and corrugated </p><p>box-board cartons.  The company also offers professional </p><p>services in packaging design. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (37) NASCO Marketing Company Limited was incorporated in </p><p>1990 to provide marketing services to other NASCO Group </p><p>companies.  The company is involved in product development, </p><p>packaging design, sales promotion, distribution, advertising </p><p>and market research.  NASCO Marketing Company has </p><p>approximately 450 distributors, 150 direct cash customers and </p><p>85 appointed supermarkets.  These customers are serviced via </p><p>eight depots located around the country in major state </p><p>capitals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (30) NASCO Management Services Limited provides management </p><p>support, such as manpower planning and financial and </p><p>administrative services, to the NASCO Group companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (38) NASCO Property and Investment Company Limited has </p><p>responsibility for NASCO\'s cosmetics business and is </p><p>developing (among other prjects) one of Nigeria\'s largest </p><p>private housing estates, NASCO Town, a commercial and </p><p>residential estate in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Economic Impact </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) NASCO is probably the largest private sector employer </p><p>in Plateau State and the mainstay of the state capital\'s </p><p>productive economy.  Unlike many of Nigeria\'s industrial </p><p>plants, NASCO has functioned successfully in Nigeria for </p><p>nearly 40 years.  Freezing its assets would shut the company </p><p>down and sharply increase unemployment and poverty, the prime </p><p>factor that led to September\'s massive bloodletting (over </p><p>3,000 dead).  USG economic development policy in Nigeria </p><p>encourages increased industrial capacity, particularly in the </p><p>food processing/agribusiness sector.  Closing NASCO would run </p><p>counter to these objectives, while also profoundly </p><p>destabilizing an already restive area. </p><p>6. (S) According to a published January 2000 interview with </p><p>Mr. Attia A. Nasreedin, NASCO Group (Nigeria) Limited is the </p><p>only fully integrated company in Nigeria that sources 95 </p><p>percent of its inputs from local raw materials.  In 1999, </p><p>NASCO Group (Nigeria) Limited turnover equaled roughly N2.7 </p><p>billion (USD 27 million).  These companies combined directly </p><p>employ over 1500 Nigerians.  Since each formal-sector worker </p><p>in Nigeria typically supports between 9 and 15 dependents, </p><p>the direct impact of an assets freeze (which would quickly </p><p>halt production if implemented correctly) would have an </p><p>enormous and highly negative impact.  Shutting down NASCO </p><p>would have a powerful, albeit indirect, negative impact on </p><p>the entire economy:  Nine depots, 450 distributors and 85 </p><p>appointed supermarkets around the country would suffer </p><p>significant (perhaps total) loss of business without NASCO </p><p>products.  Most of NASCO\'s suppliers would lose a critical </p><p>(perhaps the critical) outlet for their products.  Entire </p><p>farming communities in the vicinity of Jos could be ruined </p><p>(high transport costs might make it uneconomical for them to </p><p>sell to other buyers, assuming such buyers could be found. </p><p>Nigerians would lose access to an entire range of affordable </p><p>consumer goods, damaging their already lessened sense of </p><p>well-being.  We could expect many consumers to be "priced </p><p>out" of such staples as corn flakes and laundry soap.  Those </p><p>who could afford to pay for imported substitutes would pay </p><p>far more.  An economy just hit with a major fuel price </p><p>increase would feel another blow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y (CORRECTING DECL AND REASON) </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Political Impact </p><p>------------------ </p><p>7. (S) The case of NASCO reflects the delicate balance we </p><p>must strike between the national security imperative to </p><p>confront and combat terror and our longer-term interests in </p><p>minimizing the gulf between USG perceptions of our efforts </p><p>and those of Muslims and the developing world.  If we are to </p><p>retain key allies in the war on terror, our actions must not </p><p>visit destruction (even economic destruction) on their </p><p>people.  Nigeria has the largest Muslim population in Africa, </p><p>and its economy is struggling to reach self-sustaining </p><p>growth.  Reaction in the Muslim community would be strong and </p><p>negative.  We are far from certain that the GON would agree </p><p>to freeze NASCO\'s Nigerian assets (since that would </p><p>effectively shut down the companies and leave tens of </p><p>thousands destitute).  If it did, media and prominent </p><p>individuals heretofore sympathetic to our anti-terror </p><p>campaign could be expected to question our motives </p><p>(suggestions that NASCO was being closed so that U.S. </p><p>products could replace Nigerian ones) and to argue that the </p><p>GON was putting Western economic interests ahead of those of </p><p>Nigeria (recycling of the old "lackey of Western interests" </p><p>charge). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S) Recognizing that our principal national interest at </p><p>this time is eradicating terrorism and denying it support, </p><p>the Mission notes that account must be taken of our other </p><p>national interests.  We are not in a position to evaluate the </p><p>negative impact that NASCO\'s continued operation in Nigeria </p><p>might have on the war on terror, but we can say with </p><p>certainty that, absent evidence that could be released to the </p><p>Nigerian public, shutting down NASCO would seriously impair </p><p>(possibly destroy) U.S. credibility as regards economic </p><p>reform:  We cannot argue that investment in the Nigerian </p><p>agro-industrial sector is a key to self-sustaining growth and </p><p>then shut down a paragon of that sector without public </p><p>explanation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S) As noted above, Plateau State and some areas that </p><p>adjoin it are restive.  Widespread unemployment, notably </p><p>among youth, was the prime factor underlying the horrible </p><p>bloodletting in September of 2001 (3,000-plus deaths).  If we </p><p>convince the GON to shut down NASCO, thousands more will lose </p><p>their jobs, and tens of thousands will suffer.  The result </p><p>will be greater instability in the eastern Middle Belt.  Such </p><p>instability would be detrimental to our key objective of </p><p>sustaining Nigeria\'s nascent democracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S) Para 2 of Ref B sets forth strategic objectives for </p><p>our public diplomacy efforts in support of the war on terror. </p><p> These include fostering an international environment </p><p>conducive to our efforts to build and maintain coalitions for </p><p>a war on terrorists with global reach, convincing </p><p>international publics that the war on terrorism is in the </p><p>interest of their nations, and reducing anti-American </p><p>sentiment.  As we have explained above, the tactic of </p><p>freezing NASCO\'s assets in Nigeria would run counter to each </p><p>of these strategic objectives. At bottom, the average </p><p>Nigerian, whether Moslem or not, would be hard pressed to </p><p>understand how shutting down his supplier of cornflakes and </p><p>cookies helps the global battle against terrorism. Many </p><p>Nigerians sympathetic to the war against terror would view </p><p>this as an example of the USG using its weight to overstep </p><p>its bounds. Unless we can make a compelling public case, too </p><p>many Nigerians would suspect an ulterior motive behind our </p><p>action. The sympathy of many Nigerians, including some now </p><p>positively disposed toward us and our anti-terror efforts, </p><p>would turn against us unless we can tell them why this step </p><p>is necessary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S) As briefly mentioned in para 7 above, placing NASCO </p><p>on the assets freeze list would also place the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration in awkward straits.  The GON has been </p><p>pilloried by domestic opponents as too eager to please the </p><p>West by joining the battle against terrorism and too eager to </p><p>bend to Western pressure on belt tightening economic reform </p><p>that might hurt the consumer in the short haul, e.g. the fuel </p><p>increase.  These criticisms, one political, the other </p><p>economic, converge in the case of the possible NASCO asset </p><p>freeze.  Unless the freeze order is accompanied by the </p><p>disclosure of corroborating evidence, the GON will face a </p><p>barrage of public criticism if it decides to close this </p><p>network of companies and negatively affect the national </p><p>economy without receiving a tangible compensatory benefit </p><p>(e.g., debt forgiveness) in return. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S) Moreover, the GON will want to resist the notion </p><p>that it allowed a conduit of terrorist financing not only to </p><p>operate here, but to become a leading enterprise.  It could </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y (CORRECTING DECL AND REASON) </p><p>be made to appear that the Obasanjo Administration does not </p><p>know what is happening in its own backyard.  This could hurt </p><p>the GON\'s credibility at a sensitive time.  Because the GON </p><p>has been a staunch ally against terrorism we should do what </p><p>we can to avoid placing it in this whipsaw. </p><p>13. (S) Should Washington decide to include NASCO on the list </p><p>but not to divulge convincing evidence, the impact to our </p><p>interests here and the bilateral relationship perhaps could </p><p>be lessened if the NASCO inclusion is limited, at the present </p><p>time, to other NASCO operations, such as the parent based in </p><p>Turkey.  If the freeze on the parent begins to affect the </p><p>subsidiaries in Nigeria, it will be seen as the indirect </p><p>consequence of action taken in a third country and not a </p><p>direct result of a request made by the USG to the GON.  We </p><p>could also engage with the GON to find a way to sterilize the </p><p>proceeds of NASCO\'s Nigeria operations, so that they could </p><p>not readily fund terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (S) Last, we foresee no great political or economic </p><p>fallout in placing the handful of Nigerians and expatriates </p><p>working in Nigeria for NASCO in key positions on the list. </p><p>As long as NASCO keeps operating, most Nigerians will not </p><p>care.  If NASCO fails some years down the road because of the </p><p>withdrawal of management talent, we believe the public </p><p>response will at that time be manageable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (S) In the final analysis, not knowing the extent to </p><p>which NASCO\'s Nigerian operations contribute to financing </p><p>global terror, the Mission is unable to do a cost/benefit </p><p>calculation in terms of U.S. national interests.  That will </p><p>have to be left to those who have access to both parts of the </p><p>equation.  What we can say, however, is that shutting down </p><p>NASCO\'s industrial and commercial operations in Nigeria will </p><p>have considerable negative fallout. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.
