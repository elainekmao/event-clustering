<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000979 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DS/OP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, AND SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR RIEDL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, PREL, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: UK BOMB EXPERT PREDICTS GROWING MAOIST CAPABILITY; </p><p>UK MISSION ASKS US FOR REPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: MICHAEL MALINOWSKI, AMBASSADOR, EMBASSY KATHMANDU. </p><p>REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On 20 May, Ambassador received a letter from UK </p><p>Charge Andrew Mitchell the text of which follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text </p><p> </p><p>You may be aware that an expert in explosives from the </p><p>British Army has recent(sic) visited Nepal for consultations </p><p>with the Royal Nepal Army on the level of bomb technology </p><p>being used by the Maoists.  He visited for five days and was </p><p>able to see a number of devices recently deployed by the </p><p>Maoists.  His report is yet to be published, but you may </p><p>welcome an indication of the main points. </p><p> </p><p>Our expert was surprised by the technical nature of the </p><p>devices and the rapid advance and adaptation of both </p><p>technology and attack tecniques.  He was surprised in </p><p>particular by the use of electronics to improve command wire </p><p>devices and ingenious switches to insure the detonation of </p><p>hand thrown grenades.  He anticipates that large vehicle </p><p>bombs, heavy mortars, and radio controlled devices will be </p><p>the next escalation in Maoist capabilities, and that such a </p><p>development is only months away. </p><p> </p><p>This level of ability has surprised us.  We believe it is </p><p>unmatched by the Royal Nepal Army bomb disposal capability. </p><p>We are looking into ways of assisting the Royal Nepal Army in </p><p>the development of their bomb disposal expertise.  But we </p><p>will need first to establish more precisely their existing </p><p>capability before we are able any firm decisions.  One thing </p><p>which could help us come to an informed position sooner would </p><p>be early sight of your Assessment Team\'s recent report. </p><p>Peter Jones at our Embassy in Washington has already been in </p><p>touch with State Department and we look forward to seeing a </p><p>copy in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>End Text </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) Comment and Action Request:  Post notes that the </p><p>British Chief of Defence Staff will be visiting Nepal Friday. </p><p> We ask that a copy of the PACOM Assessment Team\'s report be </p><p>made available to the British, either in Washington or </p><p>London, as soon as possible. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
