(SBU) PRO-DEMOCRACY WRITER HA SY PHU REMAINS AT HIS </p><p>HOME IN DALAT IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS PROVINCE OF LAM </p><p>DONG AND CONTINUES TO BE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY </p><p>POLICE.  A CZECH-TRAINED BIOLOGIT WHO FORMERLY WAS </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE VIETNAMESE INTITUTE OF SCIENCE IN </p><p>DALAT, PHU HAS WRITTEN NUMEROUS ESSAYS ADVOCATING </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND GREATER OBSERANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  ON MAY 12 HE WS NOTIFIED BY PROVINCIAL </p><p>POLICE HE WOULD BE CHARED WITH TREASON UNDER ARTICLE </p><p>72 OF VIETNAM\'S CRMINAL CODE.  HOWEVER, MORE THAN TEN </p><p>WEEKS LATER, HE HAS YET TO BE FORMALLY CHARGED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) HA S PHU (WHICH IS THE PEN NAME USED BY </p><p>NGUYEN XUAN U) HAD HIS HOME SEARCHED APRIL 28 BY </p><p>POLICE, WHOCONFISCATED HIS COMPUTER, PRINTER, AND </p><p>DISKETTESAND RESOURCE MATERIALS.  TWO WEEKS LATER LAM </p><p>DONG POLICE RETURNED TO NOTIFY HIM OF TWO DECISIONS </p><p>SGNED BY THE PROVINCIAL POLICE CHIEF.  PHU WAS </p><p>REUIRED TO REPORT DAILY TO THE LOCAL POLICE STATION </p><p>FOR QUESTIONING AND HE WAS TOLD HE WOULD BE TRIEDFOR </p><p>TREASON.  (COMMENT: BOTH STATEMENTS WERE SIGNED BY </p><p>COL. NGUYEN VAN DO, POLICE CHIEF OF LAM DON PROVINCE, </p><p>AND MAY REFLECT THE VIEWS OF ONLY LOCL OFFICIALS. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) SINCE THI TIME, NO FORMAL LEGAL ACTION HAS </p><p>BEEN TAKEN AGANST PHU.  IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST BY </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR FOR INFORMATION ABOUT HIS CASE, ON JULY </p><p>24 TH MFA PROVIDED THE EMBASSY WITH A NON-PAPER </p><p>STATIG THAT PHU HAD NOT BEEN ARRESTED OR PLACED UNDER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01671  01 OF 03  031049Z </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION (DESCRIBED AS "ADMINISTRAIVE </p><p>PROBATION" BY THE GVN).  THE PAPER SAID THAT ECAUSE </p><p>HA SY PHU "COMMITTED VIOLATIONS OF CRIMINL LAW," LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN LAM DONG BEAN A FORMAL </p><p>INVESTIGATION INTO HIS CASE MAY 10. THE NOTE SAID PHU </p><p>HAS BEEN ORDERED NOT TO "TRAVE OUT OF HIS PLACE OF </p><p>RESIDENCE DURING THE INVESTIATION."  (COMMENT: WE </p><p>BELIEVE THIS MEANS HE IS CNFINED TO HIS HOME, THOUGH </p><p>THE NOTE IS NOT PRECIE AND MAY REFER TO THE CITY </p><p>WHERE HE LIVES.  ENDCOMMENT.)  THE NOTE CONCLUDES BY </p><p>STATING THAT SETLEMENT OF HIS CASE "DEPENDS ON THE </p><p>RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION" AND MUST BE N </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SB) NOTE: FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS PHU HAS BEEN </p><p>ONITORED CLOSELY BY POLICE.  IN DECEMBER 1995 HE WS </p><p>ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH "REVEALING STATE SECRTS" </p><p>FOR POSSESSING A LETTER FROM THEN-PRIME MINITER VO </p><p>VAN KIET REFERRING TO THE NEED FOR FURTHER ECONOMIC </p><p>AND POLITICAL REFORMS.  PHU WAS IMPRISONED WITHOUT </p><p>TRIAL UNTIL AUGUST 1996, WHEN HE WAS SENTENCED TO A </p><p>YEAR IN PRISON.  DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS, PHU\'S </p><p>PHONE HAS BEEN MONITORED AND CUT OFF PERIODICALLY. </p><p>LOCAL POLICE HAVE PATROLLED OUTSIDE HIS HOME AND </p><p>CONFISCATED HIS COMPUTER ON TWO OCCASIONS.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO ONE REPORT, HE WAS FORCED TO REPORT TO THE LOCAL </p><p>POLICE ON A VIRTUALLY DAILY BASIS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS </p><p>LATE IN 1999 AND IN EARLY 2000. </p><p> </p><p>HA SY PHU DEFENDED BY OTHER ACTIVISTS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) BECAUSE HA SY PHU IS ONE OF VIETNAM\'S MOST </p><p>OUTSPOKEN PRO-DEMOCRACY ADVOCATES, THE RESTRICTIONS </p><p>PLACED ON HIM IN MAY RESULTED IN A FLURRY OF ACTIVISM </p><p>ON HIS BEHALF.  ON MAY 19, FIVE PRO-DEMOCRACY </p><p>ACTIVISTS IN VIETNAM, INCLUDING DR. NGUYEN THANH </p><p>GIANG, SIGNED AN APPEAL ADDRESSED TO NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>MEMBERS PROTESTING THE ACTIONS AGAINST HIM.  THE FIVE </p><p>PERSONS WHO SIGNED THE LETTER, ALL IN THEIR 60\'S OR </p><p>70\'S, WERE GEOPHYSICIST GIANG, WHO WAS JAILED FROM </p><p>MARCH-MAY 1999 FOR HIS PRO-DEMOCRACY WRITINGS; HOANG </p><p>MINH CHINH, SELF-DESCRIBED AS THE FORMER SECRETARY- </p><p>GENERAL OF THE VIETNAMESE DEMOCRATIC PARTY; WRITER </p><p>HOANG TIEN; JOURNALIST AND RETIRED COLONEL PHAM QUE </p><p>DUONG; AND MILITARY VETERAN TRAN DUNG TIEN.  BOTH </p><p>DUONG AND TRAN DUNG TIEN WERE AMONG A HANDFUL OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01671  02 OF 03  031050Z </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS TO RESIGN IN JANUARY 1999 TO </p><p>PROTEST THE EXPULSION OF WAR HERO TRAN DO. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) THE OPEN LETTER FROM THESE DEMOCRACY </p><p>ACTIVISTS DEFENDED PHU\'S RECORD AND NOTED HE HAD DONE </p><p>NOTHING TO DESERVE BEING CHARGED WITH TREASON, WHICH </p><p>THEY POINTED OUT CALLS FOR MINIMUM SENTENCES RANGING </p><p>FROM 7-20 YEARS IMPRISONMENT AND CAN RESULT IN THE </p><p>DEATH PENALTY.  THE OPEN LETTER DESCRIBED PHU\'S </p><p>PREVIOUS WORK AS A BIOLOGIST, AS WELL AS HIS "PROFOUND </p><p>POLITICAL DISCOURSES" SUCH AS "REFLECTIONS OF A </p><p>CITIZEN" AND "FAREWELL TO IDEOLOGY."  THE AUTHORS SAID </p><p>THAT PHU\'S DISCOURSES "CARRY HIS HEART AND SOUL ON A </p><p>SINGLE SUBJECT: THE URGENCY OF DEMOCRATIZATION FOR THE </p><p>SAKE OF THE COUNTRY.  THE PROSPERITY OF THE PEOPLE, </p><p>THE WELL BEING OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE EQUALITY AND </p><p>ADVANCEMENT OF SOCIETY DEPEND ON TRUE DEMOCRACY." </p><p>(NOTE: PHU\'S WRITINGS HAVE INCLUDED BITING CRITICISM </p><p>OF THE CPV.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN "FAREWELL TO IDEOLOGY," </p><p>PUBLISHED IN 1995, HE WROTE TO THE CPV LEADERS: </p><p>"MARXISM-LENINISM IS JUST FEUDALISM IN DISGUISE.  BE </p><p>GENTLEMEN AND LET THIS DOCTRINE SAY GOOD-BYE TO OUR </p><p>PEOPLE OPENLY.  LET\'S PART ON GOOD TERMS.") </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) THE OPEN LETTER ALSO INCLUDES A STRONG </p><p>INDICTMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION DECREE, </p><p>SAYING THAT IT ALLOWS POLICE TO TAKE ARBITRARY ACTION </p><p>AGAINST PHU AND OTHER PERSONS.  THE LETTER NOTES THE </p><p>DECREE ALLOWS OFFICIALS TO "DETAIN ANY CITIZENS </p><p>SUSPECTED OF BEING A POSSIBLE SECURITY THREAT, WITHOUT </p><p>THE NEED FOR A JUDICIAL TRIAL AND WITHOUT REGARD FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01671  02 OF 03  031050Z </p><p>THE RIGHT OF THE ACCUSED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES."  THE </p><p>PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS CALLED ON THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY TO IMMEDIATELY ABOLISH THE DECREE BECAUSE IT </p><p>"BLATANTLY VIOLATES" VIETNAM\'S CONSTITUTION AND PLAYS </p><p>A "DESTRUCTIVE ROLE" IN SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF THE OPEN LETTER, </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH ASIA AND SEVERAL VIETNAMESE- </p><p>AMERICAN NGO\'S AND INTERNET NEWS SERVICES CIRCULATED </p><p>NEWS OF THE ACTIONS AGAINST PHU AND CALLED FOR </p><p>CLEARING HIM OF ANY POSSIBLE CHARGES.  THE EMBASSY HAS </p><p>RAISED HIS CASE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WITH THE </p><p>MINISTRIES OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC SECURITY, AND </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY KOH DISCUSSED PHU\'S CASE IN DETAIL </p><p>DURING THE U.S.-VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE IN </p><p>WASHINGTON JUNE (REF C).  ALSO, AS NOTED ABOVE, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ASKED FOREIGN MINISTER NIEN FOR INFORMATION </p><p>ABOUT PHU DURING A JULY MEETING (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>OTHER DISSIDENTS NOT ABLE TO CONTACT PHU </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) IN ORDER TO SEEK FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE </p><p>CONDITIONS FACED BY HA SY PHU, POLOFFS CONTACTED GIANG </p><p>AND HO CHI MINH CITY-BASED DISSIDENT NGUYEN DAN QUE. </p><p>GIANG SAID HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET MUCH MORE </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT PHU SINCE HE SIGNED THE OPEN LETTER </p><p>DESCRIBED ABOVE.  (GIANG ALSO SAID HE HAS FACED NO </p><p>REPRISALS SINCE SIGNING THE LETTER.)  GIANG TRIED TO </p><p>CONTACT HA SY PHU BY PHONE, BUT PHU\'S PHONE IS CUT </p><p>OFF.  (GIANG, WHOSE HOME PHONE IS ALSO DISCONNECTED, </p><p>USES A CELL PHONE, BUT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE PHU HAS A </p><p>CELL PHONE.)  GIANG ALSO SAID HE HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL </p><p>CONTACTING PHU THROUGH MUTUAL FRIENDS IN DALAT.  GIANG </p><p>SAID NONE OF PHU\'S FRIENDS ARE ABLE TO VISIT HIM AT </p><p>HOME, AND PHU MUST REPORT EVERY DAY FOR INTERROGATION </p><p>AT THE LOCAL POLICE STATION.  ONE OF GIANG\'S FRIENDS </p><p>BASED IN DALAT WHO ALSO ADVOCATES FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>REFORM TOLD GIANG THAT PHU IS HELD IN CONDITIONS LIKE </p><p>HOUSE ARREST.  (SEPTEL WILL REPORT FURTHER ON </p><p>CONDITIONS FACED BY GIANG, QUE AND OTHER DISSIDENTS.) </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) DR. NGUYEN DAN QUE TOLD POLOFF THAT HE TOO WAS </p><p>UNABLE TO CONTACT PHU.  QUE NOTED THAT PHU HAD SENT A </p><p>TET CARD TO HIS WIFE EVERY YEAR WHILE QUE WAS </p><p>IMPRISONED (FROM 1990-98), BUT QUE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE </p><p>TO MEET HIM SINCE QUE WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON.  QUE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01671  03 OF 03  031050Z </p><p>NOTED HE HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH A FRIEND IN THE </p><p>NEIGHBORING PROVINCE OF BUON ME THUOT, WHO DID NOT </p><p>KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PHU\'S CONDITION.  QUE OPINED THAT </p><p>THE AUTHORITIES LIKELY WERE ADOPTING A "WAIT AND SEE" </p><p>ATTITUDE BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO CHARGE HA SY PHU </p><p>FORMALLY.  QUE BELIEVES THAT INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM </p><p>OF THE ACTIONS AGAINST HA SY PHU HAS GIVEN PAUSE TO </p><p>SECURITY OFFICIALS, WHO LIKELY WOULD HAVE MOVED TO </p><p>CHARGE HIM QUICKLY IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH CRITICISM. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) THE ONGOING INTERROGATION AND ISOLATION OF HA </p><p>SY PHU FOLLOWS A FAMILIAR PATTERN PRACTICED BY </p><p>VIETNAMESE SECURITY OFFICIALS.  IN ORDER TO INTIMIDATE </p><p>AND FRAGMENT THE SMALL NUMBERS OF ACTIVISTS PRESSING </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN VIETNAM, LOCAL POLICE </p><p>PERIODICALLY CRACK DOWN ON SELECTED INDIVIDUALS BY </p><p>CALLING THEM IN FOR REPEATED QUESTIONING, CUTTING OFF </p><p>THEIR COMMUNICATION LINKS WITH SUPPORTERS, AND </p><p>THREATENING THEM WITH HARSH PRISON TERMS.  AS NOTED IN </p><p>THE OPEN LETTER FROM GIANG AND HIS ASSOCIATES, THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION DECREE PROVIDES WIDE LATITUDE </p><p>FOR OFFICIALS TO INTIMIDATE AND HARASS THOSE </p><p>ADVOCATING "TREASONOUS" IDEAS SUCH AS MULTI-PARTY </p><p>DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) THE THREAT MADE AGAINST PHU IN MAY THAT HE </p><p>MIGHT BE CHARGED WITH TREASON, WHICH POTENTIALLY COULD </p><p>CARRY THE DEATH PENALTY, MAY PROVE TO BE A CASE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01671  03 OF 03  031050Z </p><p>LOCAL POLICE EXCEEDING THEIR MANDATE, SINCE IT HAS </p><p>BEEN NEARLY THREE MONTHS SINCE THE WRIT WAS PRESENTED </p><p>TO PHU.  IN ANY EVENT, WE CONCUR WITH DR. QUE THAT THE </p><p>STRONG INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM OF PHU\'S HARASSMENT </p><p>LIKELY HAS CAUSED GVN OFFICIALS TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER </p><p>THE IMPLICATIONS OF MOVING FORWARD WITH CHARGES.  THAT </p><p>SAID, CHARGES MAY INDEED BE FILED AGAINST HIM, SINCE </p><p>THE MFA NOTE DECLARES THAT PHU HAS "COMMITTED </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF VIETNAM\'S CRIMINAL LAW."  BUT EVEN IF HE </p><p>IS NEVER FORMALLY CHARGED, THE COLD WET BLANKET OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S INTRUSIVE POLICE APPARATUS HAS DESCENDED </p><p>AGAIN ON HA SY PHU, SEEKING TO SMOTHER OUT HIS CALLS </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC REFORM.  IN VIETNAM TODAY, ONLY A </p><p>HANDFUL OF PERSONS SUCH AS PHU, GIANG AND QUE ARE </p><p>WILLING TO ENDURE THE KIND OF HARASSMENT SUCH VIEWS </p><p>ENTAIL.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
