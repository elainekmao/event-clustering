<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 004311 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/03/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, CG, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: S/E WOLPE BRIEFS MNANGAGWA ON LUANDA MEETINGS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY S/E HOWARD WOLPE FOR REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON AUGUST 3 SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE AND AF </p><p>SPECIAL ASSISTANT JOHN PRENDERGAST MET BRIEFLY WITH </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA IN </p><p>THE LATTER\'S OFFICE.  MNANGAGWA REMAINS PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE\'S ENVOY FOR SENSITIVE MISSIONS VIS-A-VIS THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.  WOLPE REPORTED THAT HE </p><p>HAD HAD VERY GOOD MEETINGS IN LUANDA, PARTICULARLY WITH </p><p>VICE-MINISTER OF SOCIAL COMMUNICATIONS MANUEL AUGUSTO, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04311  031205Z </p><p>WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS THE EXPERT ON THE DETAIL OF LUSAKA </p><p>ACCORDS AND BEING VERY CLOSE TO PRESIDENT DOS SANTOS. </p><p>"ZIMBABWE AND ANGOLA ARE POINTED IN THE SAME DIRECTION," </p><p>WOLPE STATED.  HE REPORTED THAT THE ANGOLANS WANTED TO </p><p>BRIDGE THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THEIR COUNTRY AND RWANDA AND </p><p>UGANDA, AND THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS COMMITTED TO HELP </p><p>THEM DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) RESPONDING TO WOLPE\'S CONCERN THAT CONGOLESE </p><p>PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA WAS PLACING OBSTACLES IN THE </p><p>WAY OF THE PEACE PROCESS AND THAT ONLY TWO WEEKS </p><p>REMAINED UNTIL THE UN SECURITY GENERAL HAD TO SUBMIT HIS </p><p>REPORT ON THE CONGO TO EXPAND THE MONUC MANDATE, </p><p>MNANGAGWA CHIMED IN THAT "THE DRC DELEGATION WAS WAY OFF </p><p>THE MARK."  THE SPEAKER SAID THAT HE HAD CHAIRED THE </p><p>VICTORIA FALLS MEETING OF JULY 27 IN WHICH HE MADE PLAIN </p><p>TO THE CONGOLESE CHIEF DELEGATE TO THE UPCOMING </p><p>POLITICAL COMMITTEE MEETING THAT ZIMBABWE WAS COMMITTED </p><p>TO THE LUSAKA PROCESS.  THE CONGOLESE IN TURN OBDURATELY </p><p>INSISTED THAT HE HAD "A MESSAGE" FROM PRESIDENT KABILA </p><p>AND COULD NOT CHANGE HIS POSITION.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>NEVERTHELESS THOUGHT THAT SOME CONGOLESE MINISTERS HAD </p><p>SENSE AND FELT ZIMBABWE\'S POSITION WAS THE CORRECT ONE. </p><p>OBSERVING THAT SOMETIMES THOSE MINISTERS DO NOT GIVE </p><p>THEIR PRESIDENT THE BEST ADVICE, MNANGAGWA REPORTED THAT </p><p>HE WOULD BE TRAVELING TO LUBUMBASHI, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE ZIMBABWEAN MILITARY, TO MEET WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT KABILA ON AUGUST 7. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SPECIAL ASSISTANT PRENDERGAST INFORMED MNANGAGWA </p><p>THAT UGANDA AND RWANDA HAD GIVEN THE USG ASSURANCES THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04311  031205Z </p><p>THEY WOULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE IF ZIMBABWE WERE WILLING </p><p>TO APPLY NEEDED PRESSURE ON THE CONGOLESE, SUCH AS </p><p>WITHDRAWING OR RE-DEPLOYING TROOPS.  WOLPE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE RWANDANS ALSO WOULD LIKE TO RE-DEPLOY TO THE KIVUS, </p><p>BUT ARE CONCERNED THAT KABILA AND THE FAC WOULD SEEK TO </p><p>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH A MOVE.  IN RESPONSE THE SPEAKER </p><p>INTERJECTED THAT "OUR INTERESTS ARE IDENTICAL."  "WE </p><p>NEED TO FORCE KABILA\'S HAND IN IMPLEMENTING LUSAKA," HE </p><p>ADDED, "HE WON\'T DIFFER WITH US IF WE TELL HIM."  THE </p><p>SPECIAL ENVOY CONTINUED THAT THERE WERE TWO FLASH POINTS </p><p>THAT NEEDED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION: EQUATEUR AND IKELA, </p><p>WHERE WE HAD UNCONFIRMED MOVEMENTS ON BOTH SIDES. </p><p>MNANGAGWA SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>IKELA, BUT WOULD CHECK WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE DEFENSE </p><p>FORCE.  HE CONCURRED WITH WOLPE\'S ASSESSMENT THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE WAS PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO BEING DRAGGED INTO </p><p>RENEWED HOSTILITIES AS A RESULT OF KABILA\'S MISPLACED </p><p>TRIUMPHALISM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO WOLPE\'S AND PRENDERGAST\'S </p><p>QUESTIONS ON INTERNAL ZANU-PF DEBATES ON ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE CONGO, MNANGAGWA SAID THAT THE </p><p>RULING PARTY HAD IN FACT DECIDED TO PULL OUT ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>TROOPS FROM THE CONGO.  IT IS NOW UP TO THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY DECISION, MNANGAGWA CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
