COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05355  01 OF 02  311600Z </p><p>1.    (C) SUMMARY:  IN RESPONSE TO A HUMAN RIGHTS UPDATE, MFA </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR CENTRAL AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS </p><p>NICOLO\' GORETTI SHARED INFORMATION ON HOW THE GOI AND OTHER </p><p>EU MEMBERS VIEWED CUBA AND THE EU DIALOGUE WITH IT.  HE </p><p>LOCATED ITALY IN A "PRO-ENGAGEMENT" GROUP ALONG WITH OTHER </p><p>"LATIN" MEMBERS.  SIMILARLY, HE SUPPORTED CONTINUED DIALOGUE </p><p>EVEN THOUGH THE TALKS HAD PRODUCED LITTLE AND WERE UNLIKELY </p><p>TO ACCOMPLISH MUCH IN THE FUTURE.  FINALLY, GORETTI TOUCHED </p><p>ON TRADE ISSUES AND PREVIEWED DIPLOMATIC AND HUMANITARIAN </p><p>SUBJECTS LIKELY TO BE RAISED AT THE NOVEMBER 4 EU-CUBA </p><p>MEETING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (SBU) ON OCTOBER 25 AT THE MFA, POLOFF DELIVERED REF B </p><p>DEMARCHE ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA TO OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>CENTRAL AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS NICOLO\' GORETTI DE </p><p>FLAMINI.  GORETTI SET THE TONE FOR REMARKS THAT SEEMED </p><p>CONTRADICTORY BY OPENING A HALF-HOUR DISCOURSE WITH THE </p><p>COMMENT, "I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.  I COMPLETELY AGREE."  HE </p><p>CONCURRED THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IS WORSENING WITH, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THE HARASSMENT OF THE PROJECT VARELA ORGANIZERS. </p><p> GORETTI WAS FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF THE CASES DESCRIBED IN THE </p><p>NON-PAPER AND HAD EVEN RECEIVED A COPY OF THE DEMARCHE THAT </p><p>AMEMB PARIS HAD DELIVERED.  HE PROMISED TO PASS THE NON-PAPER </p><p>TO THE EU PRESIDENCY FOR THE UPCOMING MEETING AND NOTED THAT </p><p>THE DANISH PRESIDENCY WAS VERY WELL INFORMED BECAUSE, HE </p><p>BELIEVED, IT HAD AN AMBASSADOR IN HAVANA. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) AS NOTED IN REFS C AND D, GORETTI HAD CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT PROJECT VARELA.  NOTING THAT THE GOI </p><p>AGREES WITH VARELA, HE SUGGESTED THAT THE USG NOT "PUSH TOO </p><p>MUCH," WHICH COULD DISCREDIT LOCAL ACTIVISTS.  CASTRO\'S CLAIM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05355  01 OF 02  311600Z </p><p>THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS THE REAL FORCE BEHIND VARELA </p><p>WAS INCORRECT BUT AN EASY CRITICISM.  INSTEAD, THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD FINESSE ITS SUPPORT.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, FORMER PRESIDENT CARTER COULD MORE CREDIBLY PUSH THE </p><p>INITIATIVE THAN THE USG.  NOTING THAT THE EU HAD MADE A </p><p>STATEMENT IN FAVOR OF IT, GORETTI CALLED VARELA A "USEFUL, </p><p>DEMOCRATIC INITIATIVE" THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>APPRECIATED BY THE GOC. </p><p> </p><p>4.    (C) ADDRESSING THE EU-CUBA DIALOGUE, GORETTI SAID, </p><p>"PERSONALLY I DON\'T THINK IT WILL BE VERY SUCCESSFUL."  THE </p><p>DIALOGUE HAD "BEEN WITHOUT CONTENT SINCE DECEMBER ... NOT </p><p>VERY FRUITFUL OR ADVANCING."  NONETHELESS,  HE ASSERTED, IT </p><p>WAS "GOOD" OR "WORTH A TRY" TO CONTINUE. </p><p> </p><p>5.    (C) GORETTI DESCRIBED THE EU MEMBERS AS FALLING INTO </p><p>THREE  CAMPS:  THE UK, WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO </p><p>DIALOGUE; SWEDEN, HOLLAND, AND DENMARK, WHICH THOUGHT </p><p>DIALOGUE WAS HOPELESS AND INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ABUSES; AND A "LATIN" GROUP OF ITALY, FRANCE, BELGIUM, </p><p>AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT SPAIN AND PORTUGAL, WHICH FAVORED </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH CUBA IN ORDER TO PUSH FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>ENCOURAGE A FUTURE ECONOMIC OPENING. </p><p> </p><p>6.    (C) FOR ITS PART, THE GOC FAVORED CONTINUING DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH THE EU, NOTING THAT IT HAD GOOD BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BUT A POOR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, IT WANTED TO JOIN THE AFRICAN, CARIBBEAN, </p><p>PACIFIC (ACP) INITIATIVE ESTABLISHED BY THE COTONOU </p><p>AGREEMENT.  THE LATIN GROUP HAD HELPED CUBA OBTAIN OBSERVER </p><p>STATUS AT THE OPENING SESSION OF EU-ACP TRADE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05355  01 OF 02  311600Z </p><p>REDUCING TARIFFS, AS A WAY OF PREPARING IT FOR A POST-CASTRO </p><p>ERA.  CUBA NEEDED TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>COMPLYING WITH INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS INSTEAD OF BEING </p><p>ISOLATED.  (AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS, GORETTI CITED CUBA\'S </p><p>REFUSAL TO ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL RULES IN THE PARIS CLUB WITH </p><p>REGARD TO THE DEBT IT OWES RUSSIA.)  TO BECOME A MEMBER, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE GOC WOULD HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE COTONOU CRITERIA </p><p>AND SUBMIT AN APPLICATION.  THE GOI DOUBTS CUBA COULD EVER </p><p>QUALIFY UNDER CASTRO. </p><p> </p><p>7.    (C) GORETTI PREVIEWED THREE OTHER ISSUES LIKELY TO COME </p><p>UP NOVEMBER 4:  RENEWAL OF THE EU COMMON POSITION, A </p><p>POTENTIAL UNHRC RESOLUTION, AND CUBA\'S NEED FOR HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  THE CUBANS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY ASK FOR THE </p><p>DECEMBER NON-RENEWAL OF THE "TOUGH" EUROPEAN COMMON POSITION </p><p>THAT CALLS FOR CUBAN DEMOCRATIZATION.  IN A DIPLOMATIC DANCE </p><p>WHOSE ENDING IS PRE-DETERMINED, THE EU WOULD PROMISE TO TAKE </p><p>CUBA\'S VIEWS INTO CONSIDERATION BUT CERTAINLY RENEW THE </p><p>POSITION.  THE RENEWAL WOULD INFURIATE THE GOC, WHICH WOULD </p><p>CLAIM THAT THE EU WAS TOO INFLUENCED BY THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>THE GOC WOULD BE SIMILARLY IMPOTENT TO FORESTALL THE ANNUAL </p><p>UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE CONDEMNATION OF IT, ABOUT WHICH IT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4286 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05355  02 OF 02  311600Z </p><p>ACTION WHA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /005W </p><p>                  ------------------017D75  311654Z /38 </p><p>R 311455Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6711 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2908 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005355 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/30/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, CU, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI COMMITTED TO BUT PESSIMISTIC ABOUT EU-CUBA </p><p>DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p>WAS "WORRIED." </p><p> </p><p>8.    (C) THOUGH IT WAS "OUT OF CHARACTER," CUBA WOULD </p><p>REQUEST MORE AID NOV. 4, GORETTI PREDICTED.  RECENT TYPHOON </p><p>DAMAGE HAD COMPOUNDED THE POST-9/11 DOWNTURN AND CREATED A </p><p>"CRITICAL, VERY ALARMING SITUATION," WITH A THOUSAND FAMILIES </p><p>HOMELESS AND MANY MORE STARVING.  IN THIS DESPERATE CONTEXT, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05355  02 OF 02  311600Z </p><p>THE GOC HAD ASKED THE EC FOR HELP, PARTICULARLY FOOD AID. </p><p> </p><p>9.    (SBU) FINALLY, GORETTI NOTED, TWO HUNDRED AMERICAN </p><p>BUSINESSMEN HAD RECENTLY VISITED CUBA TO SELL GOODS AT THE </p><p>AMERICAN STAND AT A COMMERCIAL FAIR ATTENDED BY CASTRO. </p><p>GORETTI CLAIMED THAT THE AMERICANS HAD GROSSED $250M.  HE </p><p>NOTED THIS WITH SOME ENVY, BECAUSE ITALIAN BUSINESSMEN TEND </p><p>NOT TO GET PAID FOR THEIR GOODS, WHICH THE GOC BUYS ON </p><p>CREDIT.  STILL, THE GOI WAS PLEASED WITH THE AMERICAN SALES, </p><p>BECAUSE CUBANS "DESPERATELY NEED EVERYTHING." </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05355 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
