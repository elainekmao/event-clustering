<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000628 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY:  CONCERN WITH RESOLUTION OF TWO </p><p>LARGE BANKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Bankers and financial analysts in </p><p>Istanbul January 23 pointed to the lack of resolution of two </p><p>problem banks - Pamukbank and Yapi Kredi Bank, both owned by </p><p>the Cukurova Group - as the single biggest problem at present </p><p>for Turkey\'s reform program.  The Cukurova Group refuses to </p><p>give up its 45 percent share of Yapi Kredi Bank as part of a </p><p>deal to repay its $5.2 billion debt to the two banks; the </p><p>banking board (BRSA) sees its options as limited in the </p><p>absence of political-level support from the GOT.  Resolution </p><p>of the two banks is a key condition under the IMF Fourth </p><p>Review and the GOT must act soon, to either persuade </p><p>Karamehmet to come to terms with the BRSA or take over the </p><p>nearly insolvent Yapi Kredi Bank.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Disbank CEO Tayfun Bayazit (an upcoming banker in </p><p>mid-forties) summed up the reform situation on January 23 as </p><p>follows: "the government will somehow come close on the </p><p>budget to satisfying the IMF, it will probably drop the worst </p><p>of its Procurement Law changes and find other ways to help </p><p>its businessmen.  But there is no way around dealing with </p><p>Yapi Kredi and Pamuk."  Like others in Istanbul, Bayazit </p><p>worries about the lack of decisive action by the GOT and its </p><p>banking board, the BRSA, in resolving these two large banks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Offer: A Debt-Equity Swap, But No Penalty for </p><p>Non-Acceptance </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) BRSA Vice Chairman Pazarbasioglu told us January 22 </p><p>that the banking board is reluctant to take further action on </p><p>the two banks without signs of political-level support from </p><p>the government.  The BRSA made a proposal to the Cukurova </p><p>Group:  the BRSA would forgive the Group\'s $2.7 billion debt </p><p>to Pamukbank if the Group would give the BRSA an "equivalent" </p><p>amount of equity shares in the Group\'s other holdings (which </p><p>include controlling interests in Yapi Kredi Bank, Turkcell, </p><p>broadcast and print media, an internet service provider, and </p><p>construction equipment manufacturer, among others).   The </p><p>deal also involves the Group dropping its law suits against </p><p>the BRSA.  Following the deal, the BRSA would allow the Group </p><p>to restructure its other debts ($2.3 billion to Yapi Kredi, </p><p>$200 million to other BRSA-controlled banks).  But the BRSA </p><p>has set a January 31 deadline for the offer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) IMF resrep told us the IMF is concerned that BRSA\'s </p><p>offer to the Cukurova Group may present problems for the </p><p>Fund, in that the kind of valuations of shares that the BRSA </p><p>appears willing to accept may add to a "sweet deal" for </p><p>Cukurova.  But resrep added that the IMF would not get in the </p><p>middle of the negotiations between BRSA and  Cukurova. </p><p>Separately, HC Istanbul (an Istanbul brokerage) research </p><p>director Huseyin Kelezoglu learned of the deal through his </p><p>own BRSA contacts, and told us he sees the proposed swap as </p><p>"very favorable to Cukurova."  In effect, Cukurova would give </p><p>up control of Yapi Kredi and some other lesser companies, but </p><p>keep its shares of cash cow Turkcell, Turkey\'s largest </p><p>cellphone operator (the company is currently valued at about </p><p>$3 billion, but was worth $17 billion in 2000).   This deal </p><p>allows Karamehmet to keep his shares of Turkcell. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Despite these views of a "sweet deal," Cukurova </p><p>Group president Karamehmet probably won\'t agree to it, per </p><p>BRSA\'s Pazarbasioglu.  The deal would require him to give up </p><p>control of Yapi Kredi which Karamehmet needs to continue </p><p>funding the other, weak parts of the Group, per </p><p>Pazarbasioglu.  He has no incentive to strike a deal, she </p><p>continued, because the deal involves the worst thing that can </p><p>happen to him - losing Yapi Kredi.  Asked why the BRSA didn\'t </p><p>press criminal fraud charges against Karamehmet (as it did in </p><p>2000 and 2001 against other bank owners who siphoned funds to </p><p>bankrupt their banks), she summarized, "lack of political </p><p>support." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, Yapi Kredi is Insolvent </p><p>or On Verge Thereof </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) BRSA\'s Pazarbasioglu told us that Cukurova\'s </p><p>failure to pay off its $2.2 billion debt to Yapi Kredi is </p><p>bankrupting the bank.  Yapi\'s capital adequacy ratio is about </p><p>3 percent, she said. But, Cukurova has not paid Yapi in over </p><p>a year; under banking rules Yapi should increase its loan </p><p>loss provisioning for this non-performing loan from the </p><p>current 50 percent to 100 percent.  If Yapi was forced to </p><p>fully provision for its Cukurova debt, the bank would have </p><p>negative equity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.   (SBU) Comment: The BRSA must under Turkey\'s banking law </p><p>take over Yapi Kredi Bank if the bank has negative equity. </p><p>But there is another provision of the banking law that could </p><p>also be invoked in the case of Yapi Kredi:   taking over a </p><p>bank if its weakness poses a systemic risk to the banking </p><p>system.  Yapi Kredi fits this description, its deterioration </p><p>poses systemic risks.  With about $7.5 billion in deposits, </p><p>it has the second largest retail franchise among non-state </p><p>banks in Turkey (only Isbank is larger), and is the leading </p><p>T-bill trader for retail customers.  It also has about $2 </p><p>billion in government securities among its own assets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Karamehmet in the Bunker </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Yapi Kredi Exec VP Huseyin Imece told us Karamehmet </p><p>is not thinking rationally about the BRSA deal.  Imece agrees </p><p>with others that Karamehmet should walk away happy if he gets </p><p>to keep his main asset, the Turkcell shares.  Instead, per </p><p>Imece, Karamehmet worries about his reputation if he\'s seen </p><p>to be kicked out of banking, and prefers to fight it out in </p><p>the courts.  He seethes, per Imece, at the bad press he gets </p><p>from his rival Aydin Dogan (who owns more media than him and </p><p>also owns Disbank).  But Imece is very concerned with the </p><p>reaction of Yapi Kredi creditors (it has about $2 billion in </p><p>exposure to foreign banks) if the January 31 deadline passes </p><p>without a deal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Among the Karamehmet rivals that stand to benefit </p><p>from his losing Yapi Kredi is the Koc Group.  Kocbank acting </p><p>CEO Kemal Kaya told us January 22 that Kocbank/Unito Credito </p><p>remain very interested in buying Yapi Kredi from BRSA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Nearly everyone in the business community has some </p><p>self interest at stake in the BRSA-Cukurova Group talks, and </p><p>their views are naturally colored.  But it\'s also true that </p><p>the GOT must soon take charge of resolving this deteriorating </p><p>situation at Yapi Kredi, either forcing Karamehmet to come to </p><p>terms or taking over his remaining bank (and then collecting </p><p>on his outstanding debts). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
