<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 002451 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR J. BUNTIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIPR, ETRD, KU, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAITI GOVERNOR PLEDGES IPR SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 01989 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 123166 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY. As part of a new push for much needed </p><p>intellectual property rights (IPR) reform in Kuwait, </p><p>following the release in May of the latest Special 301 review </p><p>(reftels), the Ambassador met June 3 with the Governor of </p><p>Hawally, where most of Kuwait\'s pirated goods are repeatedly </p><p>produced and sold.  The Ambassador voiced his concern that </p><p>Kuwait\'s poor record on IPR protection and enforcement was </p><p>tarnishing its image to investors and was possibly linked to </p><p>more serious crimes, such as drug sales and terrorist </p><p>financing.  The Governor agreed and said he was willing to </p><p>support the USG in its efforts, including meeting with the </p><p>Minister of Interior to discuss ways to improve enforcement </p><p>of Kuwait\'s copyright laws.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. On June 3, 2003, the Ambassador met with the Governor of </p><p>Hawally, AbdulHameed Haji AbdulRaheem, and members of his </p><p>staff to discuss IPR issues in Kuwait.  AbdulRaheem served </p><p>for 15 years in Kuwait\'s Ministry of Interior before becoming </p><p>governor three years ago.  Hawally, one of six governorates </p><p>in the country, is the site of the majority of Kuwait\'s sale </p><p>of illegal audio visual goods, which account for 95 percent </p><p>of the motion pictures and nearly 65 percent of the music </p><p>sold in the country, according to latest industry estimates. </p><p>The Ambassador was joined by Econoff as notetaker and a </p><p>Foreign Commercial Service specialist. </p><p> </p><p>3. The Ambassador explained to AbdulRaheem that with the </p><p>release of the Special 301 review the Embassy was undertaking </p><p>a new push for IPR reform in Kuwait.  This effort included </p><p>encouraging the GOK to pass amendments to its copyright law </p><p>(as it promised to do more than a year ago) and seeking ways </p><p>to assist the GOK in curbing rampant IPR violations.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that copyright violations continue to pose a </p><p>serious problem and are tarnishing Kuwait\'s image among </p><p>investors, resulting in a large loss of revenue to other </p><p>countries in the region.  He also voiced concern over the </p><p>link between IPR piracy and other crimes, including the </p><p>prospect of terrorist financing, as many of the pirated goods </p><p>entering Kuwait come from Indonesia, Pakistan, and other </p><p>countries known for terrorist activities. </p><p> </p><p>4. The Ambassador said he met recently with members of </p><p>industry (including from Microsoft and the Motion Picture </p><p>Association), who claimed that the main problem in Kuwait was </p><p>one of enforcement, deriving from the fact that Kuwait\'s </p><p>Ministry of Information has the authority but lacks the </p><p>manpower or will to make adequate arrests.  AbdulRaheem </p><p>agreed that the police force, under the Ministry of Interior, </p><p>would be more effective at making raids and leading </p><p>investigations, should they be granted the legal authority to </p><p>do so. </p><p> </p><p>5. AbdulRaheem said he would be willing to meet with the </p><p>Minister of Interior to discuss ways to restructure the </p><p>present system so that the police might become more involved. </p><p> He also pledged his support to the Ambassador in the </p><p>Embassy\'s efforts to encourage IPR reform in Kuwait.  The </p><p>Ambassador, in turn, said he would ask to meet with the </p><p>Ministers of Information and Interior to discuss this issue. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
